00:04.081 --> 00:05.143
Let's say that again.

00:05.163 --> 00:05.663
Mr. Lewis said what?

00:05.683 --> 00:10.450
Mr. Lewis said that the foundation of every civilization is collecting.

00:10.891 --> 00:18.081
That if it hadn't been for the collectors in all the great civilizations, they would have had none of the past to build upon.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.504
You see, that's one of the theses of my book.

00:20.705 --> 00:25.211
The Romans stole, not stole, they bought everything from Greece.

00:25.231 --> 00:26.894
The Greeks took over from Egypt.

00:26.954 --> 00:30.359
Egypt took over from... I start my book in Alexandria, of course.

00:30.939 --> 00:33.463
And there is enough material...

00:33.933 --> 00:37.377
where you can really get a profile of the collecting.

00:38.699 --> 00:44.685
Well, it seems that every civilization has taken the treasures from the one before it and built up on it.

00:45.126 --> 00:50.012
And the first thing that Hitler did was to ransack every library and every museum.

00:50.132 --> 00:50.833
Oh, yes, he could.

00:50.873 --> 00:53.976
He dragged all his loot to Germany, of course.

00:53.996 --> 00:54.717
To keep or to destroy?

00:54.737 --> 00:55.218
Oh, to keep.

00:55.578 --> 00:59.923
Some were destroyed because they were ruthless, but most of it was to keep whatever he could.

01:00.967 --> 01:03.731
But it seems that every conqueror has done that.

01:03.931 --> 01:04.532
It's not unusual.

01:04.552 --> 01:09.419
As recently as Saddam Hussein, who was savaging the museum.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.302
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:11.662 --> 01:15.107
That's the one thing they wanted to grab.

01:15.127 --> 01:26.704
And in a milder, more pleasant fashion, America, being a rich country, is now absorbing the treasures through purchase and honest dealing.

01:27.106 --> 01:34.375
But nevertheless, drawing together materials from other nations into this country so that researchers come to the great universities here to study.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.681
If you read my time's piece, there's a little section in there on Texas.

01:39.321 --> 01:46.610
And of course, the University of Texas has a fabulous collection that was put together in about 15 years.

01:46.871 --> 01:52.658
And of course, when I was down there last year, I heard at least four British accents.

01:52.874 --> 01:55.918
I mean, because that's where the material was.

01:55.938 --> 01:56.659
Yes, exactly.

01:56.679 --> 01:57.760
And then we'd have to go.

01:58.381 --> 02:07.353
Well, there was a time, I'm not sure it's true now, but it still may be, when Mr. Lewis said that Yale was the center for 18th century English studies.

02:07.373 --> 02:08.935
Indeed it is, and it continues to be.

02:08.955 --> 02:16.545
And so that that was what he wanted to enlarge and add to, and did.

02:16.565 --> 02:18.087
And did, in fact.

02:18.107 --> 02:21.632
I love the fact that all this stuff didn't move to New Haven.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.546
Well, he wanted it to be part of his house for many reasons, and that brings us to another thing.

02:26.566 --> 02:28.789
Do you see the lantern here that you're sitting under?

02:28.809 --> 02:30.491
I'll light it for you in a minute.

02:30.551 --> 02:40.163
That lantern used to hang in Walpole's house, but Mr. Lewis said that objects are documents.

02:40.183 --> 02:42.967
It was one of his favourite terms, that an object is a document.

02:43.007 --> 02:43.888
What did he mean by that?

02:44.008 --> 02:49.115
Well, he meant that you could read into an object as much as you could from a book.

02:51.578 --> 02:51.838
He...

02:52.004 --> 03:02.376
gave as an insult the work of archaeologists and the fact that you can build up the great civilization of Greece on a Roman vase.

03:03.217 --> 03:11.847
There's so much to be seen tangibly within an object, so that he passionately fond of books as he was.

03:11.887 --> 03:15.832
Nevertheless, he collected objects, too, to some extent.

03:15.852 --> 03:20.998
Now, there are a great many things that are attributed to Walpole that he couldn't prove, so he didn't buy.

03:21.653 --> 03:30.644
I have a very interesting quote from Roger Kennedy, who directs the Smithsonian in Washington, the Museum of American History.

03:31.365 --> 03:39.915
We're talking about Texas, and one of the allegations over the years that they were buying a lot of junk as well as a lot of significant material.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.599
And he said, you know, the junk is very significant.

03:43.860 --> 03:45.061
This is Kennedy speaking.

03:45.101 --> 03:47.644
He said, because to really truly understand the masterpiece,

03:48.130 --> 03:55.982
Sometimes you really have to follow all of the failed efforts and all the junk, the path that takes you to the altar, so to speak.

03:56.002 --> 03:56.522
Yes, quite.

03:56.542 --> 03:57.704
That's a very interesting assertion.

03:57.784 --> 04:01.910
I think that it's a parallel assertion that the object is a document.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.753
We have to read out of it.

04:03.833 --> 04:04.394
Yes, I think so, too.

04:04.654 --> 04:05.215
I think so, too.

04:05.556 --> 04:12.005
As a matter of fact, there are instances of this here, because you see there are several, if you look behind you, many volumes of the same title.

04:12.466 --> 04:17.293
And the fact is that Walpole printed off his works at Strawberry Hill Press.

04:17.493 --> 04:22.079
but made corrections after the first printing, and then the next printing was different.

04:22.119 --> 04:23.621
So these are all variants, in other words.

04:23.641 --> 04:24.742
All variants.

04:24.763 --> 04:29.769
And he, too, wanted to have an example of every printing from that press.

04:29.789 --> 04:32.152
Well, I think from a scholarly point of view, it's essential.

04:32.232 --> 04:32.813
Yes, it is.

04:32.973 --> 04:39.422
And you'd think that the last one would be the only one that was important, but you can see what the author did as he went along, how he improved it and how he altered it.

04:40.383 --> 04:42.125
Now tell me a little bit about your own background.

04:42.706 --> 04:43.467
Oh, well.

04:43.919 --> 04:45.521
What brought you here?

04:45.801 --> 04:46.782
Nothing very exciting.

04:46.862 --> 04:54.351
I was born in England and brought up in England and met my husband who was fighting over there in World War II.

04:55.192 --> 04:57.174
That was how we met and how I came over here.

04:57.935 --> 05:02.741
But I had parents who were always interested in the 18th century, so I was brought up on a lot of literature in the period.

05:03.121 --> 05:06.005
That appealed to Mr. Lewis.

05:06.025 --> 05:07.987
And I happened to live in Farmington.

05:08.007 --> 05:12.272
I was also interested in library work and worked in the

05:12.438 --> 05:15.140
village library in Farmington for a number of years.

05:16.121 --> 05:22.928
So that when Mr. Lewis's librarian retired, he called me and asked me if I'd take her place, which I did.

05:22.948 --> 05:23.588
That's wonderful.

05:23.608 --> 05:23.969
It was.

05:24.109 --> 05:27.412
It was absolutely marvelous for me because we got along awfully well.

05:27.432 --> 05:32.436
And did he ever tire of the excitement of the chase and the hunt?

05:32.456 --> 05:32.677
Never.

05:32.717 --> 05:32.897
Never.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.098
Not until his dying day.

05:34.118 --> 05:34.598
No, no, no.

05:34.639 --> 05:41.685
He was after, he read every catalogue, was frantically keen to fill in any gap that there might be.

05:41.935 --> 05:43.944
and was always interested in new material.

05:44.467 --> 05:50.494
Was the object the collection, the building of a great collection,

05:52.938 --> 05:57.543
You see, so many collectors acquire things, and then once they have them, they lose interest in them.

05:57.563 --> 05:59.826
That would be an example.

05:59.866 --> 06:02.549
Well, he sold off everything, remember, long before he died.

06:02.609 --> 06:05.832
No, I don't remember in his case, but I have known collectors who've done that.

06:05.972 --> 06:06.613
A friend of mine.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.155
Jerome Curran is another example.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.037
Yes, I've known collectors do that.

06:10.177 --> 06:15.503
A friend of my mother was a great collector and sold everything, saying that it was within...

06:15.635 --> 06:18.217
themselves, and they didn't need the object anymore.

06:18.258 --> 06:25.705
No, Mr. Lewis was different, I think, partly because he was a creative man, and he was writing in and around his collection all his life.

06:26.125 --> 06:31.610
He himself produced works from his collection, so they were his source material as well.

06:32.371 --> 06:36.835
So the collection energized his own work as much?

06:37.556 --> 06:37.696
It did.

06:37.716 --> 06:38.677
It did very much so.

06:39.598 --> 06:44.983
Well, his great work, of course, was editing the letters of Franz Walpole, the 50-volume

06:45.284 --> 06:46.185
Well, is it fifty?

06:46.225 --> 06:50.509
Well, I mean, it doesn't matter.

06:55.754 --> 07:00.018
Forty-eight gardens.

07:02.801 --> 07:04.382
This is the old library, right?

07:04.803 --> 07:06.224
No, this is called the East Library.

07:06.244 --> 07:10.068
This is the East Library, and there are apparently four libraries in the city?

07:10.088 --> 07:13.671
There are many, really, because...

07:14.107 --> 07:15.429
They ramble all over the house.

07:16.050 --> 07:18.033
The old library is in the front of the house.

07:18.073 --> 07:21.097
You probably haven't been in it because it has nothing to do with Horace Warthogne.

07:22.039 --> 07:26.886
They're family books that he inherited and came from his wife's family and they're very beautiful books too.

07:27.867 --> 07:32.374
But this is the East, his own library over there because his desk is where Marie sits now.

07:33.696 --> 07:35.078
That's called the North Library.

07:35.899 --> 07:37.802
The new library is the great big room.

07:38.221 --> 07:40.765
That room that I was in was quite extraordinary.

07:40.785 --> 07:41.286
Yes.

07:41.306 --> 07:45.252
And then there are what are called the stacks that are upstairs here.

07:45.913 --> 07:53.304
And then down underneath the print room, there's a squash court, a filled-in squash court, filled with books.

07:53.364 --> 07:54.706
He didn't play squash.

07:55.186 --> 07:55.547
He did.

07:56.108 --> 07:56.488
He did.

07:57.530 --> 08:01.115
It was when he first lost the game that he decided to turn it.

08:01.135 --> 08:01.676
What, really?

08:02.297 --> 08:03.098
I'm not joking.

08:03.519 --> 08:04.280
He lost the game.

08:04.601 --> 08:06.203
Well, he was extremely good.

08:06.503 --> 08:15.417
And when he began losing, let's say, several games in a row, and he realized he wasn't as good as he was, he then thought, well, I need the space for something else anyway.

08:15.757 --> 08:18.161
So he turned it all into it.

08:18.201 --> 08:20.044
I think age was catching up on him.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.708
Roughly, where was he, did you say, in terms of age?

08:22.728 --> 08:25.432
I'm not quite sure, because it was before my day.

08:25.492 --> 08:26.374
I could find out.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.639
Can I call you sometime, by the way?

08:29.659 --> 08:32.523
Could you give me your phone number in case there's... 677.

08:32.543 --> 08:34.266
8461.

08:34.398 --> 08:37.823
846, because I'm sure there might be, that's 203, right?

08:37.843 --> 08:39.847
I'm sure there might be some things I forget to ask you.

08:40.047 --> 08:44.895
Well, I do, because I wouldn't mind in the least, and I'm retired, and I'm there all day, most of the day.

08:45.736 --> 08:49.622
Okay, and this room again, you say this was kind of his favorite room?

08:49.642 --> 08:50.584
Well, I think so.

08:50.724 --> 08:52.827
I really think it was this one and the north side.

08:52.847 --> 08:54.410
It's certainly not the most beautiful room.

08:54.971 --> 08:57.655
Well, no, because you see, he used it as a workroom.

08:58.023 --> 08:59.685
Actually, it was different in his day.

09:00.205 --> 09:02.128
Were all these file catalogs here?

09:02.228 --> 09:02.748
Absolutely.

09:02.968 --> 09:10.497
He was very keen on using all modern, at that time, of course, now... If there were computers in his day, he'd have bought one, in other words.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.260
Oh, he'd have gone into the computer business.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.922
He was always on top of everything.

09:15.282 --> 09:19.227
In his day, this kind of card catalog was the system.

09:19.527 --> 09:23.271
And during the war in Washington, he was in charge of

09:24.044 --> 09:28.149
cataloging intelligent information and making it available for all the forces.

09:28.189 --> 09:33.816
So he was very keen on making it possible for people to get the information they wanted.

09:34.837 --> 09:39.503
So I'm perfectly certain he'd have gone into computers right away.

09:39.523 --> 09:42.187
Again, let's get back to a little bit of the personality.

09:42.607 --> 09:49.876
He had a strong personality, and he had a charming sense of humor.

09:50.837 --> 09:53.781
He had very

09:54.402 --> 10:00.793
definite opinions about things, and he didn't suffer fools gladly.

10:01.014 --> 10:12.814
He liked people to be very genuine, and he could spot somebody who was genuinely interested in what he had as against people who were just asking idle questions.

10:13.816 --> 10:17.963
Do you think that the importance of his collection was recognized early?

10:19.327 --> 10:20.388
By some, definitely.

10:20.428 --> 10:30.840
I mean, for Yale, clearly, by the decision alone to publish 48 volumes of the letters, that's not an idle commitment to the point of any press.

10:30.940 --> 10:31.241
Not at all, no.

10:31.261 --> 10:32.202
That's a major commitment.

10:32.222 --> 10:35.526
But it's not only the fact that he collected the letters, which he did.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.429
If he couldn't get the original, he had a photocopy made.

10:39.510 --> 10:44.736
It was not only the collection of the letters, but... You see, this is where the collector makes a compromise with the scholar.

10:44.996 --> 10:45.977
Yes.

10:45.997 --> 10:48.220
The true collector would just want the artifacts.

10:48.841 --> 10:51.163
The scholar wants to have the material as well.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.665
He needed the material, exactly.

10:52.785 --> 10:55.208
He wanted to make... That's very important, I think.

10:55.228 --> 11:00.753
Well, also for Horace Walther's sake, he wanted to have a complete edition of his letters correctly edited.

11:00.773 --> 11:05.318
They'd been done before, but they weren't all correct by any means, which is why he redid it.

11:06.600 --> 11:15.709
And he had a splendid team of editors working down at Yale, in New Haven, on the letters.

11:16.077 --> 11:20.504
But they sent the draft of all of their work up to him, and he went through it.

11:21.085 --> 11:25.131
And he was particularly keen on making the notes extremely readable.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.974
They're in the simplest English language.

11:27.475 --> 11:30.419
Nothing difficult to understand.

11:32.843 --> 11:34.446
He hated academic jargon.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.928
He wouldn't have any kind of jargon.

11:36.269 --> 11:37.931
How many years was the project?

11:37.951 --> 11:39.794
Oh, God.

11:39.874 --> 11:41.136
I mean, I used to have all the numbers.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.059
Well, I mean, it must have been several decades.

11:43.079 --> 11:43.620
Yes, it was.

11:44.377 --> 11:52.068
It sounds like the Adams family project that the Massachusetts Historical Society is going to go on into the next century.

11:52.268 --> 11:55.052
Well, one of Mr. Lewis's achievements is that he did it.

11:56.053 --> 11:59.678
This was the first edition of all of the big ones, but he completed it.

12:03.344 --> 12:04.525
It really is quite a story.

12:04.665 --> 12:05.306
It is a story.

12:05.607 --> 12:11.515
And I think one reason that he managed to complete it was that he refused

12:13.132 --> 12:42.801
to be to go on any kind of detours if his scholarship he advocated the letters and even though the scholars working on them found fascinating information and material unless it was absolutely permanent he cut it out much to their distress so he kept the notes and the work on a very narrow straight path it wasn't easy to do because so many fascinating things turned out he said no we have to

12:43.253 --> 12:45.915
and not go down side streets.

12:45.935 --> 12:46.296
He didn't.

12:46.976 --> 12:52.281
Did he ever chat about any of his great finds?

12:52.301 --> 12:53.422
Can you think of any?

12:53.723 --> 12:58.007
Yes, well, he's told them in Collector's Progress, if you remember.

12:58.027 --> 12:58.967
That's the best.

13:00.649 --> 13:03.091
His best anecdotes are in there.

13:03.111 --> 13:03.211
Okay.

13:05.293 --> 13:07.075
Did he ever get together with other collectors?

13:07.495 --> 13:08.716
Oh, very much so.

13:08.756 --> 13:11.539
He belonged to various collection clubs.

13:12.413 --> 13:15.778
The grower, of course, I'm sure.

13:15.798 --> 13:22.567
And there were many friends and kids who were collected.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.031
What's your sign?

13:26.051 --> 13:26.752
I have an appointment.

13:26.772 --> 13:27.413
I can see that.

13:27.433 --> 13:27.533
Okay.

13:28.955 --> 13:29.977
Oh, I think you can read.

13:29.997 --> 13:30.437
32 or 32.

13:30.457 --> 13:31.358
The letter's 32 or 32.

13:31.418 --> 13:34.483
Yeah, but the first volume didn't come out until 37.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.345
Then the last volume came out in 83.

13:36.713 --> 13:38.635
Yes, you write those figures now.

13:38.655 --> 13:39.716
That's what I used to know.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.818
Thirty-seven to eighty-three.

13:41.838 --> 13:45.141
So I said decades, and that was forty-six years.

13:45.381 --> 13:46.582
Yeah, that's interesting.

13:46.602 --> 13:46.903
Wow.

13:47.223 --> 13:50.686
So this is not, as I mentioned, it's not an idle commitment.

13:50.706 --> 13:52.588
I mean, they must be very, very important.

13:52.628 --> 13:54.870
Yale would do something like this.

13:55.431 --> 13:56.472
Well, he funded it.

13:56.492 --> 13:57.132
He funded it.

13:57.372 --> 13:59.675
It had a lot to do with the fact that he provided the money.

14:00.495 --> 14:02.097
Well, would Yale still have done it, do you think?

14:02.938 --> 14:06.501
Not if they had had to throw money in, because they'd always been short of cash.

14:06.903 --> 14:08.866
Do you know offhand of what it cost him?

14:09.106 --> 14:12.251
But I'll tell you, they wouldn't fund just anybody with money.

14:12.531 --> 14:15.696
They have to have it live up to the standard that they expected it to be.

14:17.399 --> 14:23.047
He means that often in that article on hospital correspondence, it tells the importance of it.

14:23.067 --> 14:28.375
It's that often, I'll get it for you, because it tells you why it's as important as this.

14:28.395 --> 14:30.058
Okay.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.280
So he funded it.

14:33.182 --> 14:34.885
Was it a significant

14:35.084 --> 14:36.807
Oh, very much so.

14:36.827 --> 14:38.130
But don't ask me what it was.

14:38.170 --> 14:42.138
I never worked on the financial end of it.

14:42.198 --> 14:45.405
Was the source of his wealth, was it family wealth?

14:45.565 --> 14:45.805
Yes.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.010
And his wife, apparently.

14:48.110 --> 14:53.781
And his wife had great inheritance, too, from the Orkin-Closkey family.

14:53.801 --> 14:54.122
Indeed.

14:54.794 --> 14:59.879
And she died, of course, young, apparently, a young woman in... Yes, well, in 1960.

14:59.959 --> 15:07.106
...57, I think, in 1959, and young, young... Terrible for them, because they would have voted to one another, so it was very sad.

15:07.227 --> 15:10.590
Did she participate in the enthusiasm for the collection?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.371
Very much so, yes.

15:11.591 --> 15:18.258
Because so often, you know, you find that, like when Bradley Martin dies, you know, his library is up for sale within a year.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.098
Oh, I know.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.603
But then in other cases, you find where it is a...

15:25.102 --> 15:30.667
very much of a symbiotic kind of a synergistic, I guess, is a better word.

15:30.687 --> 15:34.731
Mrs. Lewis, it was she who started the printable collection.

15:35.251 --> 15:35.692
Oh, really?

15:35.752 --> 15:38.154
Yes, which went along with this, you see.

15:38.174 --> 15:39.855
Is this something you could show me, do you think?

15:39.875 --> 15:40.516
Yes, absolutely.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.158
Print them next.

15:42.398 --> 15:42.818
Okay.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.400
And Joan is a zeroxing.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.280
Oh, great.

15:45.300 --> 15:50.685
That's Mr. Wilson's own article on the correspondence on the 73 South Side.

15:50.705 --> 15:51.446
I can have this?

15:51.466 --> 15:51.706
Yes.

15:51.726 --> 15:52.347
Oh, that's great.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.708
Do you have an appointment?

15:54.110 --> 15:56.436
Yes, everyone, and I just hope thank you for coming.

15:56.456 --> 16:01.430
Thank you for having me and spending so much time with me, and it'll bear good fruit.

16:01.450 --> 16:02.573
We look forward to it.

16:02.814 --> 16:05.862
We always ask slightly if an author will send you something.

16:05.942 --> 16:08.068
Without question.

16:08.774 --> 16:12.317
It's, we hope, on Warpole's own books.

16:12.337 --> 16:17.602
Warpole's own books are on the shelves in the very same order they were in at Strawberry Hill.

16:17.962 --> 16:20.625
And the only time they're not is when they don't fit.

16:20.865 --> 16:22.106
How did he know that?

16:22.126 --> 16:23.507
When they were removed, did they...?

16:23.547 --> 16:25.649
They were catalogued in Warpole's day.

16:26.670 --> 16:27.591
With shelf marks.

16:27.671 --> 16:28.892
Yes, with shelf marks.

16:28.992 --> 16:34.718
And then Mr. Lewis devised a number system so that they would bring them all together.

16:34.838 --> 16:37.380
And, of course, he has a copy of the original catalog, which...

16:37.664 --> 16:40.587
The original one is held by the Walpole family in England.

16:40.808 --> 16:42.930
So they allow him to make a photography of it.

16:42.950 --> 16:48.457
And so judging by that, he knows that, well, this is the beginning of the collection of the A's.

16:48.817 --> 17:00.151
They went impressive A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or around the library and the Gothic costumes he built for himself.

17:00.191 --> 17:02.474
Which is closer than C2 as you can gather.

17:02.494 --> 17:05.677
Yes.

17:05.697 --> 17:06.979
Which have two seats.

17:07.330 --> 17:13.116
This is the book plate with press A, the shelf number, and the number along the shelf.

17:13.136 --> 17:13.937
Is that Walpole's hand?

17:13.957 --> 17:14.958
This is Walpole's hand.

17:15.138 --> 17:16.340
No, that is not.

17:17.221 --> 17:19.643
That's Walpole's book plate, of course.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.345
And that's Mr. Lewis's book plate.

17:21.365 --> 17:23.628
Yes, and probably we'll find some Walpole's.

17:23.788 --> 17:27.492
No, not in this, but in some of the books, you see, he's annotated.

17:27.512 --> 17:34.760
He wouldn't have annotated one like that.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.882
These are gatherer repairs that are being done?

17:37.756 --> 17:39.518
Well, it's oiling the covers.

17:40.219 --> 17:44.184
Walpole kept copies of his letters in those.

17:44.444 --> 17:48.449
All the letters are now in files, so that those folders are empty.

17:50.231 --> 17:53.955
The former squash court.

17:54.416 --> 17:57.019
This part is a mixture of books, but mostly prints.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.905
And that is the former squash court, which is now the print room.

18:02.265 --> 18:03.146
That's it.

18:04.408 --> 18:06.210
I'm just going to put this camera down here.

18:10.679 --> 18:19.352
Now whose interest was in the Prince?

18:19.753 --> 18:21.055
Was that Mr. Lewis?

18:22.377 --> 18:25.482
This is Mrs. Lewis's, so this is not really the Walpole collection.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.346
No, but he took as great an interest in it.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.269
It is part of Walpole collection.

18:30.289 --> 18:31.230
Well, is it 18th century?

18:31.290 --> 18:34.375
18th century, satirical, political princess.

18:34.557 --> 18:36.359
And, of course, many of them.

18:36.679 --> 18:38.541
Walpole himself collected them, you know.

18:38.641 --> 18:42.445
So some of Walpole's own prints are here, with his annotations.

18:44.547 --> 18:45.889
Eighteenth-century satirical?

18:46.109 --> 18:46.730
Satirical.

18:47.731 --> 18:49.372
And they made it all English, basically.

18:49.392 --> 18:49.593
Yes.

18:50.333 --> 18:50.954
Let me show you.

18:50.974 --> 18:52.656
May I show you?

18:52.676 --> 18:53.136
Yes, come on.

18:53.537 --> 18:55.879
Can I see you, please?

18:56.039 --> 18:58.142
And this is what Walpole did.

18:58.162 --> 18:59.243
John Hall.

19:00.384 --> 19:01.005
That's right.

19:01.025 --> 19:02.306
That's the fan.

19:02.326 --> 19:04.328
And that's again.

19:04.561 --> 19:18.422
I just want to show you.

19:19.184 --> 19:21.086
Anyway, here is one.

19:21.107 --> 19:22.909
Here's a frame, many of them.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.213
But you see, this is a sort of thing Walker did.

19:25.233 --> 19:29.860
This was Duke of York to explain who that is.

19:30.194 --> 19:34.220
Queen and Lear King, in case you didn't know.

19:34.821 --> 19:35.362
That's cute.

19:36.644 --> 19:39.488
But it's interesting that he collected those.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.994
It's rather as if you collected the cartoons from the New York Times.

19:44.536 --> 19:46.099
And this was the squash court, right?

19:46.279 --> 19:46.539
Yes.

19:46.639 --> 19:49.324
Which is attached to the garage, which is attached to the house.

19:51.407 --> 19:55.553
Etchings by Henry William Bunbury, B-U-N-B-U-R-Y.

19:55.593 --> 19:58.598
And after his designs, wow.

19:59.337 --> 20:04.704
And this is a... Would you say this is an elephant folio size?

20:04.724 --> 20:04.804
Yes.

20:06.846 --> 20:08.668
And they haven't really foxed at all.

20:08.688 --> 20:14.115
Have they been treated at all?

20:14.135 --> 20:18.701
Yes, they couldn't have been treated.

20:20.102 --> 20:23.667
They're nicely restored.

20:23.687 --> 20:24.748
And then they couldn't put down.

20:27.672 --> 20:28.753
These... Walcons.

20:29.476 --> 20:42.308
I think it's quite a collection, too, wasn't it?

20:42.328 --> 20:43.769
Is there something I can have?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.072
Well, it's also in the thing right there.

20:46.092 --> 20:47.733
It's already there.

20:48.033 --> 20:49.114
Oh, great.

20:49.134 --> 20:50.175
Oh, this is wonderful.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.618
All of this is in there?

20:52.638 --> 20:54.139
Well, then there's another one.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.403
I don't think I need all this.

20:58.957 --> 21:10.133
And so you do have a collector, collecting a collector.

21:10.234 --> 21:16.503
And that means that so many of the books in the other half of the house are not 18th century, they go far behind them.

21:16.623 --> 21:20.368
I mean, there's a book that belonged to Queen Lisbeth first, in that idea.

21:20.388 --> 21:21.109
Really?

21:21.130 --> 21:22.131
Because Orpo owned it.

21:22.952 --> 21:23.813
And he collected it?

21:23.874 --> 21:24.535
He collected it.

21:24.775 --> 21:26.157
He acquired it as a collector?

21:26.598 --> 21:26.938
He did.

21:27.172 --> 21:30.836
And so then Mr. Lewis acquired it because Warpole had it.

21:30.876 --> 21:31.576
That's very interesting.

21:31.596 --> 21:32.397
So we had a chain.

21:33.658 --> 21:40.946
Did they, as collectors, did they, no, no, I don't know if that'll work, but I mean, did they collect the same kinds of things?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.048
Obviously, they had some of the points collecting the other way.

21:43.068 --> 21:57.162
Well, Mr. Lewis certainly collected the same kind as Warpole for that reason, but Warpole's collection was unique and strange because he didn't collect the classics of his time the way you and I might collect first editions as authors now.

21:57.563 --> 22:01.627
he collected books that helped him with what he was interested in.

22:01.667 --> 22:08.575
He was writing a history of Richard III, for instance, so he collected around that subject.

22:08.595 --> 22:21.609
And anything that Walpole himself wrote about, he collected books to go with his own whatever it was he was interested in.

22:21.629 --> 22:23.230
I think that explains very well.

22:23.871 --> 22:24.672
This is Joan.

22:24.692 --> 22:26.013
That's how you speak.

22:26.293 --> 22:26.794
Yes, it is.

22:27.297 --> 22:34.066
And Mr. Lewis always brought Warhol into the conversation.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.087
Did you know him?

22:35.107 --> 22:35.868
Oh, let me go.

22:35.888 --> 22:36.209
Really?

22:37.330 --> 22:45.201
Could you tell me a little bit about him as an individual, particularly as a collector and his enthusiasm and his passion?

22:45.221 --> 22:47.063
It was very impressive.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.128
His enthusiasm and passion, you know.

22:50.168 --> 22:55.735
Catherine and I felt that he became

22:56.069 --> 23:02.478
And he'd come across here twice again.

23:02.518 --> 23:04.500
Come across now.

23:04.580 --> 23:10.628
Describe to me.

23:11.209 --> 23:20.401
And the door directly opposite where we're standing, here in the print room, is to the new library, the large room with the chandelier.

23:20.421 --> 23:25.468
So he'd come across here at noon and at 3.30 in the afternoon.

23:25.685 --> 23:27.748
He napped every day.

23:27.968 --> 23:29.370
Yes.

23:29.390 --> 23:35.898
And then he would come and want to see something that we had to tell him.

23:35.998 --> 23:40.003
Or if he'd bring something in the hand to tell us.

23:40.023 --> 23:41.885
He wanted to see something.

23:41.905 --> 23:43.467
He wanted to communicate.

23:43.707 --> 23:47.412
What kinds of things could you have to tell him that he didn't know?

23:47.712 --> 23:51.617
Something you had just discovered about the... Yes, we often did that.

23:51.637 --> 23:54.561
We often did work to discover.

23:54.963 --> 23:57.907
for him that day.

23:58.008 --> 23:59.249
And it was really exciting.

23:59.269 --> 24:00.171
It was contemporary.

24:00.251 --> 24:00.491
Yeah.

24:01.212 --> 24:04.197
It all brought the 18th century up today.

24:04.217 --> 24:05.519
There were many exciting things.

24:05.639 --> 24:07.982
Sometimes we'd find a note in the wall of his hand that he hadn't seen before.

24:08.163 --> 24:10.786
Sometimes you'd find a note in the wall of his hand that he hadn't seen before.

24:10.867 --> 24:11.007
Yes.

24:11.027 --> 24:13.330
That Mr. Lewis had not seen.

24:13.350 --> 24:13.951
Had no seen.

24:13.971 --> 24:14.592
That happened quite often.

24:15.297 --> 24:17.539
It was extraordinary, really, how many times.

24:17.679 --> 24:23.384
And then, of course, it depended what book he was writing or everything he was writing, so we knew what he was interested in.

24:23.424 --> 24:25.106
Even as a piece of marginalia, perhaps.

24:25.126 --> 24:26.887
Yes, that's what I meant.

24:27.348 --> 24:32.272
Or we'd get a new batch of prints in, and somebody would recognize Orpo's hand on one.

24:32.592 --> 24:35.615
In other words, if it wants to Orpo.

24:35.635 --> 24:36.776
Now, for instance.

24:37.216 --> 24:43.482
We were going through a very large collection given to you by Judge Erna Reed.

24:43.883 --> 24:58.441
As you just pointed out over here, too, his hand.

24:58.842 --> 25:01.164
We got to do with his hand extraordinarily well.

25:01.285 --> 25:03.467
He leapt from the page if we ever saw it.

25:03.487 --> 25:06.251
It was very seldom any doubt once we saw it.

25:06.271 --> 25:10.456
Now, I don't imagine either of you women are collectors.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.118
Do you collect things?

25:13.010 --> 25:15.334
Well, no, I inherited a collection.

25:15.354 --> 25:18.258
I have a collection in my house, but I didn't collect it.

25:18.438 --> 25:28.153
I'm just wondering if you, having worked so closely with a major collector, and you said that his enthusiasm is infectious.

25:28.694 --> 25:32.319
Well, because... Did you ever feel like he might catch the bar?

25:33.121 --> 25:36.426
But he would engage you in his enthusiasm.

25:36.866 --> 25:37.027
Oh, yes.

25:37.047 --> 25:38.629
That is true.

25:39.301 --> 25:41.864
I mean, you didn't look and say, my God, why did he do this?

25:41.884 --> 25:50.293
Well, once he left here, he went back in the 20th century, and once he stepped out of the building, he had to go to a very fine court.

25:50.553 --> 25:54.678
Did you find that when you came in here, however, you did step into the 18th century?

25:54.818 --> 25:56.660
Very much so.

25:56.860 --> 25:59.283
Was that a pleasant...?

25:59.864 --> 26:00.785
Yes, it was.

26:01.185 --> 26:07.452
It was absolutely enthralling, and of course we were not really in the 18th century because we didn't have the...

26:07.685 --> 26:09.647
We had all the comforts of the 20th.

26:10.989 --> 26:15.274
But was it his presence as much as the material that did that?

26:15.394 --> 26:20.020
Do you feel that way now when you come in, for instance, that you go back into the 18th century?

26:20.400 --> 26:20.941
Oh, yes.

26:20.961 --> 26:24.385
Presence is a material that sounds good.

26:24.405 --> 26:26.587
You can still hear his voice.

26:26.607 --> 26:29.190
You can still imagine.

26:29.951 --> 26:33.996
From all accounts, he was a really, very nice man, a very likable man.

26:34.398 --> 26:38.763
Everything you read about him is that he was just a genuine... He was a very charming man.

26:39.444 --> 26:41.086
Extremely distinguished to look at.

26:42.047 --> 26:44.950
And with wonderful manners.

26:45.811 --> 26:47.473
He was definitely of the old school.

26:48.314 --> 26:50.737
He was a very charming, delightful person.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.038
That's great.

26:52.999 --> 26:58.846
I think I've probably covered everything that we have to cover over there.

26:58.986 --> 27:01.789
Well, your interest mainly is in the...

27:01.972 --> 27:08.541
No, it's in the manuscripts, it's in print, it's really writing about the individual.

27:09.422 --> 27:12.626
It sounds important.

27:17.312 --> 27:25.062
But one important thing that he stressed often was that if you are a collector, you have to restrict your area to a very small area.

27:25.663 --> 27:28.907
And restricting himself to Walpole in the beginning was

27:29.107 --> 27:57.122
making it small but he said that in later in later on in his life that he'd known how huge the field was he never would have undertaken it really because he started as a young man collecting all kinds of english literature that appealed to him and then realized that he had to focus on something special then the other thing was do you think you probably want to give you the other thing and then i'll ask you a question he chose a field that had not really been done before

27:57.254 --> 28:03.023
And when young people used to come to him and say, Mr. Lewis, if you were my age now, what would you collect?

28:04.004 --> 28:11.636
He'd say, try to think of something that nobody's in the least bit interested in.

28:11.756 --> 28:12.557
It's good advice.

28:12.577 --> 28:13.399
As today, it's good advice.

28:13.419 --> 28:19.748
A long time ago, he used to say, try something around 1900 or 1910.

28:19.768 --> 28:25.337
Because everybody, the great collectors were collecting in the 18th century.

28:25.992 --> 28:32.079
A little earlier, when he was a young man, nobody thought of anything after the 17th century was interesting.

28:32.099 --> 28:38.066
When you read my piece, something in the New York Times, you'll see that that's what Texas did at an institutional level.

28:38.526 --> 28:45.955
They wanted to build a great collection, but everybody was collecting 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, so they focused on the 20th century.

28:46.876 --> 28:48.918
Because nobody else was interested in it.

28:49.179 --> 28:52.462
They basically followed his advice at an institutional level.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.044
This is what he used to tell young people.

28:54.104 --> 28:55.746
Find something that is

28:56.047 --> 28:59.111
obviously going to be of interest to future generations.

28:59.131 --> 29:00.053
Get out ahead of them.

29:00.113 --> 29:05.340
Or just try to get in on the wrong floor, because otherwise the expenses are too great.

29:05.360 --> 29:13.452
If you're a young man with a little money, you couldn't possibly compete with the older material.

29:13.472 --> 29:20.502
You must read my piece Sunday, because this is precisely what I'm writing about in this piece.

29:21.410 --> 29:26.499
Did he have it in his mind, do you think, did he want to be perceived as a great collector?

29:27.901 --> 29:29.323
I don't know.

29:29.444 --> 29:44.008
I think he would, he certainly appreciated being praised for having done something very unique for Yale, but I don't think he was as egocentric as, a lot of people did think he did

29:44.528 --> 29:46.911
It was a big deal about himself, but I don't think so.

29:47.111 --> 29:51.736
His collection was everything to him for Yale and for civilization.

29:51.756 --> 29:55.440
He definitely does.

29:56.180 --> 30:02.087
That's exactly the way Walpole himself thought about collecting.

30:02.167 --> 30:06.051
Is Walpole on record about collecting, by the way?

30:06.171 --> 30:06.852
I don't know.

30:07.052 --> 30:14.400
Walpole had about seven different kinds of collections, not only books, but he collected coins and prints.

30:14.887 --> 30:17.531
It's a great study.

30:17.712 --> 30:21.718
I mean, I might really have to smoke over time.

30:21.739 --> 30:34.219
And I think, I suppose, all the great collectors, all through the ages, have had that same idea, that you bring together material for future generations, that you're doing the public a service.

30:34.300 --> 30:39.308
You're preserving, and you're not just acquiring, but you're preserving, and you're passing on.

30:39.862 --> 30:42.686
And in his case, he really was passing it on.

30:42.826 --> 30:45.791
I know a lot of collectors who do collect just for themselves.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.675
They're not thinking necessarily of passing it on.

30:48.715 --> 30:52.701
Oh, I think, yeah, because when they died, I mean, the stuff is sold off.

30:52.862 --> 31:03.658
Even, you would hope in many cases, when it's really significant, like the Bradley Martin ornithology stuff, that definitely should have been kept together because it was extraordinary.

31:03.908 --> 31:09.493
Now George III, King, was a great collector, and he gave it all to the foundation of the British Museum.

31:09.633 --> 31:11.675
I wonder what they're going to do with it when they move.

31:11.695 --> 31:16.739
I don't know, but that made me think of Queen Mary, who was also a tremendous collector in her day.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.481
She died only recently.

31:18.501 --> 31:23.105
But I don't know whether she was collecting for the Crown, for the nation, or for herself.

31:23.225 --> 31:24.746
I really don't know.

31:26.007 --> 31:30.631
I've never discovered there is such a thing as a Queen Mary collection, though she collected madly.

31:31.012 --> 31:32.113
She had the passion.

31:32.133 --> 31:32.413
Really?

31:34.908 --> 31:39.392
This is the... The present Queen's mother.

31:39.492 --> 31:45.118
The much beloved, as they often say.

31:45.158 --> 31:50.423
Well, she was, but I think her mother was even more beloved.

31:50.443 --> 31:53.165
I'm going to check that out.

31:53.566 --> 31:55.708
But we never hear about her collection, do we?

31:55.728 --> 32:03.615
No, because she collected many, many things, but I'm not quite sure.

32:04.675 --> 32:08.222
What would you say about Mr. Lewis's buying?

32:08.242 --> 32:09.845
He would ever buy from an individual?

32:10.105 --> 32:25.776
Well, if somebody had a treasure that Mr. Lewis wanted, whether a manuscript, a book, or an object, he would have that person get it appraised properly by Sotheby's, Christie's, or some renowned... Or a quarry or somebody like that.

32:25.796 --> 32:27.038
Yes, some great appraiser.

32:27.254 --> 32:28.716
And then he would pay the correct price.

32:28.736 --> 32:34.483
So the person could be reassured in his mind or her mind that they were getting fair value.

32:34.543 --> 32:35.064
Absolutely.

32:35.124 --> 32:38.668
And then he would pay whatever the going price was.

32:39.089 --> 32:42.873
I've just not heard of anybody doing that before.

32:42.913 --> 32:46.017
Generally speaking, you try and get it at your best price.

32:46.318 --> 32:47.619
That's very noble.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.201
I think he always felt it was fair.

32:49.501 --> 32:54.848
And it turned out to be extraordinarily fair and in his favor because so often the going price

32:55.199 --> 33:23.907
years ago was incredibly low and it's mags for instance the booksellers have let mr lewis have any number of treasures that they could have sold for much much more if they hadn't sold them of course it certainly gave him credibility and he gave the right price always oh the dealers in london used to come to him immediately they had anything immediately they gave him access to everything that's great that's very important

33:24.173 --> 33:29.892
It was always an investment.

33:29.912 --> 33:33.745
If you talk about how things appreciate and value, what he spent

33:34.012 --> 33:39.698
I mean, he never had the intention of saving again, but he had childish pleasure in knowing that what he had was worth half.

33:39.718 --> 33:48.167
Well, I went through a few of the books in there, the Johnson Dictionary, for instance, and he has still in pencil what he paid, and then he... Oh, in the front of every book.

33:48.187 --> 33:57.356
And then he found a citation maybe 20, 30 years later when it was worth 650 pounds as opposed to the 30 that he paid for it, and I'm sure he had a great deal of satisfaction.

33:57.396 --> 33:58.537
Oh, he did.

33:58.978 --> 33:59.618
And I love that.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.200
We all joined in that.

34:01.838 --> 34:03.701
That's the true, that's the collector there.

34:03.721 --> 34:03.921
Yes.

34:04.141 --> 34:07.727
But then again, you see, one of our jobs was to go through the catalogues.

34:08.087 --> 34:12.133
John would go through the catalogues for prints, and I'd go through the books.

34:12.153 --> 34:16.159
And of course they had prices everywhere, the sale catalogues.

34:16.179 --> 34:20.405
And one of the fun was to sort of point out to him, Mr. Lewis, if you notice this.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.149
I mean, we used to join in the fun of it.

34:23.169 --> 34:24.551
And how long have you been here, John?

34:24.571 --> 34:25.192
I don't think the year.

34:25.212 --> 34:26.654
Twenty-five years.

34:26.674 --> 34:30.240
So you knew Mr. Lewis for quite a while ago?

34:30.260 --> 34:30.580
Yes, he knew me.

34:31.032 --> 34:32.302
Are you from Farmington?

34:33.250 --> 34:36.334
Yes, I live here.
