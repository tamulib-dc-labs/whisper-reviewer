00:01.921 --> 00:03.423
But the Odyssey first, good.

00:03.443 --> 00:13.378
But secondly, nobody likes my Harrison Ford idea, but this is a kind of a rough and tough house solo, basically, isn't it?

00:13.499 --> 00:14.760
Why couldn't it be Harrison Ford?

00:15.702 --> 00:17.324
Well, I think it could.

00:17.505 --> 00:25.116
I guess you just want somebody who... Well, it could be Harrison Ford.

00:25.136 --> 00:27.059
If your flight is clean and you can do it.

00:27.079 --> 00:28.121
And a pinch.

00:28.141 --> 00:28.361
Okay.

00:28.401 --> 00:29.042
Melinda, thank you.

00:29.309 --> 00:30.653
Thank you, you're on it.

00:30.713 --> 00:34.624
1-800-423-8255 is the connection phone.

00:34.644 --> 00:38.776
The Odyssey connection, the Homer connection, the Robert Tagle translation connection.

00:39.759 --> 00:42.627
Kirk is calling from Price Crossing, Massachusetts.

00:42.961 --> 00:43.422
Good morning.

00:43.742 --> 00:44.183
Good morning.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.525
Chris, I'm with you on Harrison Ford, for one thing.

00:46.565 --> 00:47.427
Okay.

00:47.767 --> 00:53.374
Also, I think we're all tending to think of classical actors because of that language training.

00:53.574 --> 00:55.637
I do think Kenneth Branagh would be good.

00:56.738 --> 00:58.761
I was thinking of Kevin Kline, too.

00:58.981 --> 01:01.905
I don't know if he has the... I don't know.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.847
Something doesn't seem quite right about him.

01:03.867 --> 01:05.069
How about Robert De Niro?

01:06.290 --> 01:06.911
De Niro?

01:06.951 --> 01:08.333
Well, he's too old, for one thing.

01:09.975 --> 01:10.996
How old do we think he is?

01:11.016 --> 01:12.698
That's a good question.

01:14.483 --> 01:19.350
the beginning of the Odyssey, he's, I don't know, I'm thinking like 30-ish.

01:19.390 --> 01:20.491
Maybe a little bit more.

01:20.551 --> 01:21.773
He's been away for 20 years.

01:21.833 --> 01:23.976
Telemachus is a, what?

01:24.257 --> 01:25.739
Telemachus is probably late teens.

01:26.820 --> 01:26.980
Okay.

01:27.061 --> 01:27.681
At the earliest.

01:28.402 --> 01:28.543
Really?

01:28.563 --> 01:29.083
At the youngest.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.005
Hard to say.

01:30.285 --> 01:31.527
Comer doesn't specify it.

01:31.767 --> 01:32.889
Leave it to our imagination.

01:33.790 --> 01:38.737
I really do hope, um, that Ian McKellen's listening, though, and we'll produce this.

01:38.877 --> 01:39.358
Me too.

01:39.378 --> 01:40.319
I'm with you.

01:40.339 --> 01:41.160
It would be wonderful.

01:41.240 --> 01:41.761
Yes, you would.

01:42.422 --> 01:43.123
I had, uh,

01:43.880 --> 01:56.073
I have to tell you, I'm a high school theater and literature teacher, and I have to confess that I've never read the book, and I'm really getting tempted.

01:56.514 --> 01:57.838
I'm not a book reader.

01:58.426 --> 02:00.148
Well, I'm going to look into it.

02:00.949 --> 02:01.930
Trip, you won't regret it.

02:02.231 --> 02:02.611
Thank you.

02:03.272 --> 02:06.817
Seriously, you'll say, you'll hit your head and you'll say, uh-huh.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.298
Oh, yeah.

02:08.499 --> 02:09.400
I'm really excited.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.623
And keep in mind, too, that it is never too late.

02:11.823 --> 02:14.947
As I say, it's a poem that will hit you at any age, any stage of your life.

02:15.728 --> 02:17.370
I'm looking forward to it.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.152
Good.

02:19.908 --> 02:29.560
The winter before last, no, last winter, Kurt Vonnegut's play that was generated out of the story, Happy Birthday 1 to June, are you both familiar with that?

02:29.580 --> 02:30.141
Yes, I am not.

02:30.521 --> 02:31.082
Sorry.

02:31.302 --> 02:31.603
Go ahead.

02:32.364 --> 02:36.068
Well, as one of you, who, Chris, you're familiar with it?

02:36.088 --> 02:36.469
No, I'm not.

02:36.509 --> 02:37.871
Robert Bigel is a... I am somewhat.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.493
Please tell us about your production.

02:40.214 --> 02:41.275
Well...

02:41.592 --> 02:45.595
I was very proud of my actors wrapping them around it and handling it.

02:46.036 --> 02:48.518
It was written around 1970.

02:49.139 --> 03:00.729
As a result, Vonnegut said that he was out in Cape Cod one summer with a book group reading The Odyssey, and he realized what a rat Odysseus is in some ways.

03:01.209 --> 03:11.498
So we focused on the play as Harold Ryan, the great white hunter, sort of a Hemingway-esque figure, disappear for eight years.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.432
He's a mercenary and hunter.

03:13.792 --> 03:18.178
And then there's his wife, whose name still is Penelope, waiting for him.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.079
Is she weaving?

03:19.560 --> 03:20.060
Pardon?

03:20.080 --> 03:20.701
Is she weaving?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.024
No, she's not.

03:24.546 --> 03:27.690
She has just become engaged to one of her two suitors.

03:28.150 --> 03:39.004
And Harold comes back and shows up, and he's racist, sexist, egotistical, and...

03:39.946 --> 03:41.848
I really like the play.

03:41.868 --> 03:46.414
Vonnegut says in the introduction he never found the perfect ending for it, but I think it works really well.

03:46.674 --> 03:48.095
Not with a marriage like that, no.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.817
Right, right.

03:50.618 --> 03:53.622
I never heard of it until about two years ago, and then I stumbled into it.

03:54.002 --> 03:54.263
Great.

03:54.723 --> 03:55.124
Thank you.

03:55.144 --> 03:57.887
1-800-423-8255.

03:57.947 --> 04:05.235
Robert Fagles is, I guess, the translator and the reviver of Homer in the 1990s.

04:05.356 --> 04:09.160
He's being compared with Alexander Pope,

04:10.237 --> 04:12.499
Chapman, Robert Fitzgerald.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.541
It's only a handful.

04:14.561 --> 04:21.668
I mean, there have been many, many translations of these books, many, God knows, schoolboy translations and mistranslations, but a handful of great ones.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.952
And Robert Pagels has written both now.

04:26.633 --> 04:36.042
The Iliad in 1970, the Odyssey, dressed out in book form and also in a 14-hour complete reading by

04:36.427 --> 04:38.670
the great British Shakespearean actor Ian McKellen.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.132
Give him a call at 1-800-423-8255.

04:40.532 --> 05:01.699
We're talking about one of the essential characters of all Western literature and the most incredible story, more subplots, more small parts, in heaven and on earth, in the underground, on the ocean, than we can count.

05:01.919 --> 05:06.265
We're going to talk a little bit about the story in general, the plots, the subplots, the women...

05:06.616 --> 05:12.163
Calypso, Scylla, Charypters, the Sirens, the Cyclops.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.447
What are your favorite episodes here?

05:16.528 --> 05:21.194
This was, let's face it, made for an infinite television series.

05:21.214 --> 05:22.155
Where would you begin?

05:22.195 --> 05:23.757
What would your favorite episodes be?

05:24.037 --> 05:26.240
This is a question to me.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.441
Yes.

05:27.661 --> 05:32.387
When I begin readings, I go to one of two places, and they're both in

05:35.438 --> 05:36.519
books 9 through 12.

05:37.200 --> 05:44.009
One is maybe the best-known episode, and that's The Blinding of the Cyclops, with his steak charred to red-hot.

05:44.029 --> 05:45.090
Do you want to give it to us?

05:45.531 --> 05:49.015
Well, it's a long passage, but I'll be happy to read The Blinding if you have the time.

05:49.055 --> 05:49.916
Absolutely.

05:50.157 --> 05:50.597
Are you sure?

05:50.617 --> 05:52.460
Is this the first Cyclops?

05:53.801 --> 05:56.585
Yes, this is the first Cyclops.

05:57.286 --> 06:02.172
People refer to television as the Cyclops of our time.

06:02.192 --> 06:03.754
We've got two and a half minutes before the break.

06:03.774 --> 06:04.635
Can you give us the

06:05.054 --> 06:07.356
A two-minute version?

06:07.536 --> 06:08.577
Well, give me a try.

06:08.677 --> 06:09.178
I'll see.

06:09.898 --> 06:13.462
Odysseus had him drunk, blind drunk.

06:14.042 --> 06:22.029
With that, he toppled over, sprawled full length, flat on his back, and lay there, his massive neck slumping to one side.

06:22.050 --> 06:29.797
And sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now, as wine came spurting, flooding up from his gullet with chunks of human flesh.

06:30.497 --> 06:32.479
He vomited, blind drunk.

06:33.185 --> 06:39.451
Now, at last, I thrust their stake in a bed of embers to get it red-hot, and rallied all my comrades.

06:39.591 --> 06:39.971
Courage!

06:40.472 --> 06:42.714
No panic now, no one bring back now.

06:42.754 --> 06:48.820
And green as it was, just as the olive stake was about to catch fire, the glow terrific.

06:48.840 --> 06:54.705
I dragged it from the flames, my men clustering round, as some god breathed enormous courage through us all.

06:54.745 --> 07:01.892
Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point, straight into the monster's eye they rammed it hard.

07:02.108 --> 07:16.330
I drove my waiternet from above and boarded home, as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright's drill, that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl, and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping.

07:16.811 --> 07:30.732
So we seized our stake with its fiery tip and boarded round and round in the giant's eye, till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft, and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.927
and the broiling eyeball burst.

07:35.947 --> 07:39.572
The blinding of the Cyclops in the Odyssey.

07:39.812 --> 07:42.676
Robert Fagel's reading from his own translation.

07:43.157 --> 07:49.085
This part would be cut out by the V-chip on television.

07:49.105 --> 07:51.268
Very bloody stuff, very bloody stuff.

07:51.721 --> 07:58.271
And I was going to say that the only other episode I start with, unless we're heading out of time at this point, we'll come back to it, but go ahead.

07:58.391 --> 07:59.152
All right, I will.

07:59.773 --> 08:01.435
Is the opposite of that.

08:02.056 --> 08:04.259
Odysseus is in the underworld.

08:04.279 --> 08:08.025
He hasn't seen his mother for 20 years and assumes that she's still alive.

08:08.866 --> 08:13.933
He goes to the underworld and finds her ghost, realizes that she is gone and is overwhelmed by it.

08:14.514 --> 08:19.281
That's where I began to translate the Odyssey when my own mother died from 20 years ago, and I had been

08:21.792 --> 08:22.975
first reading I translated.

08:23.897 --> 08:29.530
Fathers, sons, mothers, wives, lovers, it's all in there.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.837
We're talking about the Odyssey with the translator Robert Ago.

08:32.917 --> 08:33.759
This is the connection.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.989
Give the master translator a call at 1-800-423-TORP.

08:38.029 --> 08:39.733
We'll be back after a very short break.

08:46.531 --> 08:48.172
and this is the connection.

08:48.192 --> 08:54.618
We're talking about the Odyssey, Homer's Odyssey, newly translated by the poet Robert Fagles.

08:55.639 --> 09:04.007
As Gary Wills wrote in the New York Times Sunday Magazine last Sunday, we seem to be in the middle of a great classical revival when these ancient stories are made fresh.

09:05.068 --> 09:05.748
Are you into it?

09:05.768 --> 09:12.835
1-800-423-8255 makes the Odyssey connection.

09:13.155 --> 09:14.496
Robert Fagles, I just wanted to say

09:15.134 --> 09:31.253
Always stuck in my mind, there was a classics teacher at Yale who pointed out that if you take the name of Odysseus' son, Telemachus, and take the root of it, telemark, and translate that CH into a sort of aspiration,

09:32.532 --> 09:35.996
Greek letter key, and spell it backwards, it comes out Hamlet.

09:36.016 --> 09:37.517
Wonderful attitude.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.139
And it tells you everything.

09:39.159 --> 09:41.862
I mean, this is the troubled son.

09:42.142 --> 09:47.288
He's beside himself with jealousy for his mother's virtue here.

09:47.849 --> 09:48.810
Father's gone.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.211
How did this happen?

09:50.351 --> 09:51.372
What's he going to do?

09:51.472 --> 09:57.459
He dithers and doubts very much exactly as Hamlet did.

09:58.020 --> 10:01.223
There may or may not be an actual connection there.

10:01.777 --> 10:10.509
But it's one of those things that makes you realize these are the stories of all time, and they come back and back and back and back in literature, in life.

10:11.450 --> 10:23.166
I wanted you to sort of speculate, or maybe tell some of the stories in the book that simply won't die, that are just eternally human, or so we believe.

10:23.626 --> 10:31.497
Well, you know you're right, there's no connection between Shakespeare and Homer, no actual connection, but there's a very deep one in terms of kindred spirits.

10:31.865 --> 10:45.552
And they both seem to have written some of their very great work about a young prince, deprived of a father, in an irritating relationship with his mother, surrounded by a world they cannot fathom, cannot make any sense of.

10:46.274 --> 10:52.827
And all of a sudden, impulse comes, and the person of Hamlet's ghost, or Hamlet the father's ghost,

10:53.330 --> 10:57.856
In the person of Athena disguised as one of Telemachus' father's old friends.

10:58.737 --> 11:06.688
And it's in many ways a bolt from the blue, Athena, who comes down and urges him to be on his way out of Ithaca to look for news of his father.

11:06.728 --> 11:10.593
And yet Athena to the Greeks always means some inner impulse too.

11:10.653 --> 11:15.440
There's something on his mind that says, I have to find out about my father.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.302
I may have to go abroad.

11:17.763 --> 11:21.548
I want to see my father's old friends who fought with him at Troy.

11:21.764 --> 11:45.696
learn those stories absorb those stories and if i absorb them deeply enough i may begin to re-embody them i may begin to do what hamlet does i may begin to come of age and that's why the telemica story i think one of the reasons why it haunts and stalks us so it is the great story of the adolescent becoming of age becoming his father's son in fact so much so that even today he can

11:48.207 --> 11:49.188
battle with the suitors.

11:49.869 --> 11:53.173
We've also said, though, it's a woman's book in many ways.

11:53.874 --> 11:56.116
Give us the Penelope treatment here.

11:57.498 --> 12:03.705
The Penelope treatment is, well, Penelope is, she is all women, as Odysseus is probably all men.

12:03.745 --> 12:11.014
She's the creature of privacy, of introspection, of dreams, of recrimination.

12:11.574 --> 12:16.560
She's at the same time a wonderful and wily partner as her husband, um,

12:16.996 --> 12:19.982
Weaves plots, so she weaves webs.

12:20.002 --> 12:32.946
And between the two of them, there's a kind of unspoken but very rich complicity, man and woman, working together, first to defeat their mutual enemies, and then finally to reunite themselves and reestablish a dynasty.

12:37.195 --> 12:38.457
You're a remarkable man.

12:38.477 --> 12:47.249
1-800-423-8255 makes the Odyssey connection with the translator Robert Fagel's 1-800-423-TALK.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.614
Edward is on a car phone in Boston.

12:50.634 --> 12:51.335
Yes, Chris.

12:51.355 --> 12:51.936
Good morning, Edward.

12:52.076 --> 12:52.537
Good morning.

12:52.677 --> 12:53.078
Good morning.

12:53.538 --> 12:54.640
You're a Boston treasurer.

12:55.221 --> 12:59.086
I agree.

12:59.106 --> 13:04.654
I was hoping that your guest might recount the tale of Odysseus' dog.

13:05.073 --> 13:06.394
Oh, this is wonderful.

13:06.474 --> 13:07.956
I wish I had the time to read it.

13:08.356 --> 13:17.965
Well, I mean, that's when he gives the dog a charge when he leaves and when he comes back in disguise and the reaction of the dog.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.787
It's a great story.

13:19.807 --> 13:21.128
There's a dog part in this movie.

13:21.768 --> 13:25.131
Tell us about that.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.273
Toto.

13:27.293 --> 13:27.694
Lashy.

13:28.815 --> 13:29.996
Tell us the dog story.

13:30.156 --> 13:32.278
And, Edward, thank you very much for cuing it.

13:32.967 --> 13:41.020
One of the problems for Odysseus is to make himself known in his own palace world to people whom he really trusts.

13:41.405 --> 13:45.751
person, if you can put it that way, who recognizes Odysseus, is his dog.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.094
His dog senses exactly who is here.

13:48.614 --> 13:58.166
And he keeps his muzzle low and he thumps his tail, but he's too weak and neglected, half dead from neglect, as Homer says, to drag himself an inch toward his master.

13:58.727 --> 14:02.752
And it brings tears to Odysseus' eyes, and Odysseus doesn't cry very often.

14:03.293 --> 14:11.243
He flicks away that tear and he says to Eumaeus, the pig keeper, who still doesn't recognize the master, that this was a beautiful dog.

14:11.729 --> 14:17.380
He had all the lines, but Odysseus can't tell if he really had the speed to match his looks.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.727
Eumaeus reassures him he had the speed, the form, the flare.

14:21.168 --> 14:22.230
He was the great hunter.

14:22.550 --> 14:29.023
He was his master's dog, until his master had to go to Troy, and then he got no joy in him.

14:29.705 --> 14:33.973
This, the dog has been waiting 20 years to sense and hear.

14:39.202 --> 14:39.803
20 years.

14:40.203 --> 14:42.766
It's a great tear-jerker to the scene.

14:42.866 --> 14:49.615
It's also a test of Odysseus's iron self-control as well in the face of an overwhelming situation.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.418
Thanks for asking.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.661
Thanks for that answer, my lord.

14:54.681 --> 14:56.523
An epic for animal lovers.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.066
For dog lovers.

14:59.647 --> 15:00.988
He's back after 20 years.

15:01.769 --> 15:02.911
His son doesn't know him.

15:02.931 --> 15:04.192
His father doesn't know him.

15:04.993 --> 15:06.715
His wife doesn't know him.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.158
There's also the marvelous story of the dead.

15:09.712 --> 15:13.058
I mean, eventually, the dog recognizes him.

15:13.619 --> 15:18.668
He's identifiable also by scars from a boar's tusk.

15:18.688 --> 15:19.850
But then there's the bed trick.

15:20.070 --> 15:23.055
Do you want to give that marvelous little bit of plotting?

15:23.496 --> 15:25.219
Penelope is just like Odysseus.

15:25.259 --> 15:33.373
They're forever testing, testing people around them, testing themselves, testing each other before they can really remarry, if you can put it that way.

15:33.674 --> 15:50.552
And Odysseus is just on the edge of being recognized by Penelope when Penelope acquires Leel from the test and says to the stranger, he's calling the stranger, spend the night, if you will, and we'll make you a bed, and she tells the handmaid,

15:50.802 --> 15:56.174
to drag their favorite bed out of the bedchamber and prepare it for them.

15:56.194 --> 15:59.341
This creates enormous fleshing anger in Odysseus.

15:59.822 --> 16:04.693
He built that bed out of an olive trunk and he knows it and knows that no one could possibly move it.

16:05.078 --> 16:06.340
Something must be wrong.

16:06.360 --> 16:12.769
In reciting this history of the bed, what might be wrong, he reveals himself.

16:12.789 --> 16:13.871
This is the ultimate proof.

16:14.332 --> 16:16.695
And at that, Penelope's heart surrenders.

16:17.136 --> 16:23.165
And they are together, significantly enough, over the great ancestral bed that he built for the two of them.

16:23.445 --> 16:26.850
The very proof, the sign of their marriage, the hallmark of their marriage.

16:27.235 --> 16:28.096
Had to be him.

16:28.377 --> 16:28.998
Had to be him.

16:29.018 --> 16:30.280
No one else would know.

16:30.460 --> 16:38.292
That's such a marvelous thing, and it leads to the reconciliation of Ulysses and Penelope as read by Ian McKellen.

16:38.312 --> 16:42.578
Can we just cue the Ian McKellen reading of exactly that?

16:43.279 --> 16:50.089
He wept to see how the wife he loved, the soul of loyalty in his arms at last.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.433
Joy...

16:53.206 --> 17:20.749
Warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel when they catch sight of land, Poseidon has struck their well-rigged ship on the open sea with gale winds and crushing walls of waves, and only a few escape, swimming, struggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore, their bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy as they plant their feet on solid ground again, spared their deadly fate.

17:21.758 --> 17:33.973
So joyous now to fear the sight of her husband, vivid in her gaze, that her white arms embracing his neck would never for a moment let him go.

17:35.335 --> 17:44.386
Ian McKellen reading Robert Fagel's translation of, in the next to last book of the Odyssey.

17:44.406 --> 17:47.310
Our guest is the master translator Robert Fagel's

17:48.353 --> 17:50.581
of the Iliad and now the Odyssey.

17:50.722 --> 17:52.769
It will call it 1-800-423-8255.

17:54.034 --> 17:56.423
Jonathan is on the line from Newton, Massachusetts.

17:57.061 --> 17:58.964
Hello, Professor Fegels.

17:59.024 --> 18:00.786
Jonathan Shea.

18:00.806 --> 18:02.028
Oh, hi, Jonathan Shea.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.490
I admire your work so much.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.092
Well, you're very kind.

18:05.112 --> 18:06.675
What is your work, Jonathan?

18:07.035 --> 18:07.155
Sorry?

18:07.195 --> 18:08.217
What is your work?

18:08.237 --> 18:14.325
I wrote a book called Achilles in Vietnam, Combat, Trauma, and the Undoing of Character.

18:14.445 --> 18:15.146
A revelation.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.769
Yeah, a very important book, Jonathan.

18:16.809 --> 18:17.830
Thanks for calling.

18:17.850 --> 18:26.983
Well, I greatly admire your work, and I want to point out to your audience that

18:27.368 --> 18:41.514
Homer is enormously truthful in portraying the character of the beaten up, beaten down old soldier who is trying to return to civilian life.

18:41.534 --> 18:41.935
Yes.

18:42.370 --> 18:45.616
He is obsessed with cunning.

18:45.637 --> 18:50.466
He is obsessed with protecting himself from other people's cunning.

18:50.707 --> 18:57.460
And in the clinic, I encounter this every single day.

18:57.777 --> 18:58.298
I see.

18:58.879 --> 19:00.741
And I hope that's the subject of your next book.

19:00.801 --> 19:03.646
I know it's about Homecoming and Odysseus and the Odyssey.

19:03.666 --> 19:04.907
It is indeed.

19:05.048 --> 19:05.729
Look forward to it.

19:06.009 --> 19:07.371
Well, you're very kind.

19:07.591 --> 19:12.178
Jonathan Shea, this is sort of the Trojan War, Vietnam War connection.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.780
That's right.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.341
That's right.

19:14.561 --> 19:22.553
If I've contributed anything to the classicists, it's to insist that they do pay attention to the obvious.

19:22.904 --> 19:28.533
And that is that the Iliad really is about war and what matters to soldiers.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.896
That's a very heartening lesson and very true.

19:31.998 --> 19:33.660
Jonathan, thank you very, very much.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.985
We should talk about your book, Achilles in Vietnam.

19:37.005 --> 19:38.508
I'm very, very pleased that you called in.

19:38.748 --> 19:39.249
Anytime.

19:39.609 --> 19:39.850
Good.

19:39.890 --> 19:40.310
Thank you.

19:40.671 --> 19:41.332
Bye-bye.

19:41.352 --> 19:42.474
1-800-423-8255.

19:44.497 --> 19:46.600
Patrick is calling from Cambridge.

19:47.153 --> 19:51.218
Yes, I'm grateful for a new translation.

19:51.278 --> 19:55.063
I've been nurturing Ryu's for many years.

19:55.163 --> 19:56.685
But I wanted to point out two things.

19:57.226 --> 20:08.701
Beneath the surface of this wondrous story is condensed history, as Schleiman proved when he discovered Troy by following Homer's descriptions of the place.

20:09.121 --> 20:12.165
And I think there's also some condensed history

20:12.145 --> 20:25.623
When Odysseus comes over and gets the Cyclops drunk for the first time, I think that's the first recorded history of Europeans, if you will, getting the American Indians drunk.

20:26.484 --> 20:32.652
Because he found the land of the Cyclops after crossing the Atlantic, Homer's River of Ocean.

20:33.121 --> 20:40.272
And I think there are many other hidden pieces of condensed history that have yet to be discovered.

20:40.752 --> 20:47.022
But I'd also like to point out that there's also a wondrous symbolic language that's going on underneath.

20:47.082 --> 21:01.744
And Campbell, in Occidental mythology, just in reference to your earlier wonderful reading of the juicy poking out of the Cyclops' eye, Joseph Campbell interprets Odysseus

21:01.724 --> 21:09.456
Not as having speared the eye, but as having symbolically penetrated it.

21:09.756 --> 21:16.447
You'll remember he becomes no man to prepare for a passage to the yonder world.

21:16.627 --> 21:18.410
He loses his ego.

21:18.971 --> 21:30.128
And then, to quote Campbell, then Odysseus passed the cosmic threshold guardian to enter a sphere of transpersonal forces.

21:30.563 --> 21:33.668
over which ego has no control.

21:34.870 --> 21:42.421
That's very interesting, but one kind of reply you might give is that when Odysseus is no man or nobody, he is most himself.

21:43.163 --> 21:49.412
In other words, he uses that disguise of being no one at all in order to assert himself, to win the day against the monster.

21:49.913 --> 21:53.078
The strange combination of anonymity on the one hand,

21:53.260 --> 21:55.923
and self-assertion on the other, I think.

21:55.943 --> 22:05.715
But in any of the mystic traditions, loss of ego is really a precursor, an absolute necessity for any kind of a transcendent experience.

22:05.755 --> 22:06.475
That's very true.

22:06.515 --> 22:09.098
I would only argue that Odysseus never loses his ego.

22:09.599 --> 22:13.704
When he says, I am no man, Nemo, how do you translate that?

22:14.164 --> 22:16.467
It's Utis, or Metis.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.939
And here's where you cannot translate.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.882
Matis means nobody.

22:21.902 --> 22:25.887
It also sounds exactly like the word matis, which means cunning.

22:26.588 --> 22:31.114
When he is most nobody, he is exercising his cunning most effectively.

22:31.134 --> 22:32.556
He is matis, no one.

22:33.017 --> 22:39.506
He is also the personification of matis, cunning, craft, deviousness.

22:39.526 --> 22:39.766
Interesting.

22:39.786 --> 22:40.948
This is how a translator works.

22:40.968 --> 22:41.929
1-800-423-8255.

22:44.533 --> 22:44.833
Peter.

22:45.742 --> 22:46.824
He's calling from Cambridge.

22:47.906 --> 23:01.067
Yes, I was a little bit alarmed when he said that there's been an outburst of a new translation, which I think gives a short shrift to both Fitzgerald and Latimer.

23:09.923 --> 23:11.104
translation.

23:11.124 --> 23:14.407
You're absolutely right.

23:14.427 --> 23:19.853
I also think readers looking for God might do worse than look at B.S.

23:20.073 --> 23:23.216
Karn-Ross's essay, Which Homer Do You Prefer?

23:23.396 --> 23:23.917
Yes.

23:23.937 --> 23:29.202
Which came out in the locally produced Aryan some years ago.

23:29.222 --> 23:30.063
Yes, right.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.666
Peter, give us the short form of that essay.

23:33.086 --> 23:38.091
Well, that essay appeared, it was simply a review of

23:42.728 --> 23:44.013
translations.

23:45.097 --> 23:49.414
I think on the whole he came out in favor of the Fitzgerald other scenes.

23:52.567 --> 23:59.395
went, there was some sort of a toss-up between Fitzgerald and Lattimore.

23:59.435 --> 24:08.666
There were different things that favored each, but I mean, there's the Mandelbaum, there are a number of them.

24:08.746 --> 24:18.338
For my money, I still prefer the Fitzgerald, but this has to do both with poetry, whether one prefers a patrician language to

24:25.355 --> 24:26.617
and accuracy.

24:26.637 --> 24:29.982
These all must be kept in mind.

24:30.002 --> 24:37.835
People simply shouldn't just select, you know, say, I'm going to go out and buy the Odyssey, but be careful about the version they get.

24:38.155 --> 24:39.437
That's a very healthy warning.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.601
Yeah, Peter, it's a good point.

24:41.621 --> 24:43.604
Fitzgerald is a great translation.

24:43.664 --> 24:50.915
I think I wonder, Robert Fagos, people talk about the musicality of your language, and I think they're right.

24:50.935 --> 24:51.396
They also

24:52.135 --> 24:54.458
Ian McKellen talks about the performability of it.

24:54.478 --> 24:56.902
I mean, it's just made for acting.

24:56.942 --> 24:58.164
What was your goal?

24:58.264 --> 25:02.210
What did you want people to say about your language?

25:02.230 --> 25:06.856
I think I'd like them to say a variety of things, if I could.

25:07.858 --> 25:13.165
I'd like to be able to come a little closer to those qualities that Matthew Arnold found in Homer in the first place.

25:13.426 --> 25:19.054
Speed, directness, simplicity, and whether nobility or not, that's another matter.

25:19.642 --> 25:21.905
I'd like the poem to be as dramatic as possible.

25:21.925 --> 25:27.353
The Odyssey's 70% direct discourse in many parts can be literated and dramatized and put right on stage.

25:28.294 --> 25:34.283
I'd like it to convey the enormous range of experience, pounds quotation again, where you can get it all.

25:34.323 --> 25:43.997
And I'd like there to be some weave of voices such that you can recognize a similar but not identical voice running through the Iliad and the Odyssey.

25:44.477 --> 25:48.383
Those are some things I'd like to do, but I remember Eliot's line, um,

25:49.207 --> 25:50.608
For us, there is only the trying.

25:50.869 --> 25:53.291
The rest is not our business.

25:53.311 --> 25:58.375
1-800-423-8255, the Odyssey connection with Robert Pagels this hour.

25:58.816 --> 26:01.318
Michael is calling from Bedford, New Hampshire.

26:01.819 --> 26:02.159
Good morning.

26:02.319 --> 26:03.821
Morning, my morning.

26:03.861 --> 26:12.649
Professor, I'm just interested in how you treat the music in the theater of Odysseus, stringing the bow and plucking the bows for the string of the bow.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.550
Well, it's one of the great moments.

26:15.271 --> 26:17.073
Do you mean how do I translate it?

26:17.093 --> 26:18.454
Correct.

26:18.772 --> 26:20.675
Is there time to read, Chris?

26:20.695 --> 26:21.636
Yeah, I think there is.

26:21.656 --> 26:22.698
We ought to ask you to read it.

26:23.018 --> 26:23.539
I'd love to.

26:23.619 --> 26:24.881
This is in book 23.

26:24.921 --> 26:39.383
It's the end of book 21, and it's about what you might call the archery of song, because Odysseus as a storyteller, a harper, at the same time Odysseus as a soldier and a great archer, come together.

26:40.545 --> 26:45.893
Odysseus, mastermind in action, once he'd handled the great bow and scanned every inch,

26:46.700 --> 27:01.162
Then, like an expert singer, skilled at lyre and song, whom strains the string to a new peg with ease, making the fly and sheepgut fast at either end, so with his virtuoso ease Odysseus strung his mighty bow.

27:02.244 --> 27:09.835
Quickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch, and under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow's cry.

27:10.776 --> 27:14.462
Horrors swept through the suitors, faces blanching fiber.

27:14.662 --> 27:18.265
And Zeus cracked the sky with a bolt, his blazing sign.

27:18.766 --> 27:26.272
And the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last that the son of cunning Cronus flung that omen down for him.

27:27.193 --> 27:30.076
He snatched a winged arrow lying there on the board.

27:30.116 --> 27:36.642
The rest still bristled deep inside the quiver, soon to be tasted by all the feasters there.

27:36.702 --> 27:42.627
Setting shaft on the hand grip, drawing the notch and bowstring back, back,

27:43.163 --> 27:49.071
Right from his stool, just as he sat but aiming straight and true, he let fly.

27:50.072 --> 27:59.084
And never missing an axe from the first axe-handle, clean on through to the last and out, the shaft, with its weighted brazen head, shot free.

28:01.227 --> 28:01.928
Do you want to finish it?

28:02.328 --> 28:02.849
I'd love to.

28:02.969 --> 28:03.830
Please.

28:03.850 --> 28:11.500
My son, Odysseus looked at Polemachus and said, your guest, sitting here in your house, has not disgraced you.

28:11.817 --> 28:16.463
No missing the mark, look, and no long labor spent to string the bow.

28:17.164 --> 28:22.331
My strength's not broken yet, not quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought.

28:23.293 --> 28:27.979
But the hour has come to serve our master's right, supper in broad daylight.

28:28.700 --> 28:35.029
Then to other revels, song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.

28:35.049 --> 28:41.217
He paused with a warning nod, and at that sign, Prince Telemachus, son of King Odysseus,

28:41.652 --> 28:53.604
girding his sharp sword on, clamping hand to spear, took his stand by a chair that flanked his father, his bronze spear point, glinting now like fire.

28:54.946 --> 28:56.407
The end is near for the suitors.

28:57.548 --> 29:00.892
Father and son are about to lay waste.

29:00.992 --> 29:03.474
The next chapter is called Slaughter in the Hall.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.857
We won't get to it this hour.

29:05.877 --> 29:11.102
Can we get one more call from Harry in Wayland, Massachusetts?

29:12.112 --> 29:12.813
Good morning, Harry.

29:12.913 --> 29:13.454
Good morning.

29:13.934 --> 29:14.535
Good morning.

29:14.555 --> 29:15.456
Marvelous program.

29:16.197 --> 29:25.748
One of the things that I'd be very interested in knowing about is the Iliad from the Odyssey can both be read as the glories of war or the horrors of war.

29:26.770 --> 29:31.115
And I'd be very much interested in comments on that.

29:31.135 --> 29:41.207
I think what I'd like to say about that is something that I believe Tim O'Brien, that fine war writer and human writer, once said, that the great war stories are really not about war.

29:41.677 --> 30:01.502
They're about war as a metaphor for immortality, and I think that is really the genius of the Iliad and certainly the genius of the Odyssey, that that violence, that unspeakable violence, has a great deal to do with human frailty and human ambition, and they apply equally to men and women.

30:02.343 --> 30:07.270
I think of the Iliad, as I say, less as a story of war than as a story of mortality.

30:09.112 --> 30:09.793
Thank you, Harry.

30:10.803 --> 30:13.346
You were speaking about writing it as a drama.

30:13.506 --> 30:20.994
I wonder, to come back to a little bit of a mischievous theme about casting these parts, do you think of it as a screenplay?

30:21.014 --> 30:38.734
Would you like to see it as a television series when we speak about a classic revival in the culture and this awareness that this story underlies every travel story, every sort of self-discovery on the road story, every Star Trek, all the exploration

30:39.085 --> 30:47.644
history really of the last millennium would you want to see it made a very popular

30:48.603 --> 31:12.062
thing again this may sound like self-interest but i could only answer very much uh but beyond self-interest i think it has all of those dramatic possibilities you're talking about all those cinematographic possibilities uh for changes of locale for for great heights and great depths i think it's a perfect natural i think it can be adapted to any one of a number of media but i think too

31:12.042 --> 31:15.748
that a visual medium would just be a natural.

31:16.188 --> 31:24.201
And as I say, there are whole scenes in Homer's Odyssey that can be simply placed upon the stage or placed within the hands of a skillful filmmaker.

31:24.662 --> 31:27.666
And I'd like to see him or her do that job beautifully.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.247
So would we.

31:28.628 --> 31:29.169
So would we.

31:29.349 --> 31:30.551
I hope Hollywood is calling.

31:31.492 --> 31:33.655
A lot of great work.

31:33.716 --> 31:36.660
And certainly, well, we don't need another water world.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.805
We do need, it would be great to have a definitive,

31:40.612 --> 31:43.116
Odyssey on the screen, and the screenplay is right here.

31:43.136 --> 31:50.927
Robert Fagels, thank you enormously for this book and for this work, a lifetime of learning and devotion.

31:52.149 --> 31:57.015
Thanks also to our friend Bernard Knox, who writes the introduction, a great teacher and a great writer.

31:57.056 --> 31:58.237
Yes, yours as well as mine.

31:58.297 --> 31:59.379
Yeah, absolutely.

32:02.023 --> 32:09.994
Should we tell folks again about the reading tonight with Jason Robards at the Agassi Theater on their old Radcliffe campus?

32:10.565 --> 32:13.015
just outside Harvard Square at 8 o'clock tonight.

32:14.642 --> 32:15.245
Thank you again.

32:15.325 --> 32:18.820
We had help today from Glenn Alexander, Mark Navin,
