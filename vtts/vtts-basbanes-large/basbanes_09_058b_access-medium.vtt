00:02.545 --> 00:17.485
I'm very happy to meet you by the way.

00:17.525 --> 00:27.439
It was very nice to talk to you.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.482
I'm used to talk to people.

00:29.502 --> 00:30.543
You are my first.

00:30.743 --> 00:36.989
And also, you know, you are a scholar first.

00:37.009 --> 00:40.412
And very often, if you meet journalists, they are not so scholars.

00:41.113 --> 00:43.355
Well, they don't read the books first.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.316
No, that's one thing.

00:44.657 --> 00:50.482
And the other thing is also that you are a bibliomania.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.184
I specialize in books.

00:52.264 --> 00:54.246
All I write about is books and authors.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.648
And it's always a question, bibliomania.

00:56.668 --> 00:57.409
What is the word?

00:57.878 --> 01:00.239
I even traced the history of the Lord.

01:00.784 --> 01:02.640
I traced it to his first years.

01:02.992 --> 01:08.837
And I even wrote Bernard Knox.

01:08.857 --> 01:16.344
Life is but a walking shadow of poor players.

01:17.024 --> 01:25.772
Life is but a walking shadow of poor players.

01:26.312 --> 01:31.817
Life is but a walking shadow of poor players.

01:31.797 --> 01:33.299
And then he's heard no more.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.902
It's a player who walks out.

01:35.922 --> 01:38.125
Nobody's copying it down, no tape recorder.

01:38.145 --> 01:40.307
He says the words and they vanish.

01:40.728 --> 01:46.155
It is a tale told by an idiot.

01:46.235 --> 01:51.381
And then he says, and then the next line is, out, out, breathe candle.

01:52.022 --> 01:52.422
That's right.

01:52.442 --> 01:53.984
Out, out, breathe candle.

01:54.164 --> 01:55.726
That's the beginning.

01:55.826 --> 01:57.889
Out, out, breathe candle.

01:58.109 --> 02:00.072
Line is better walking shadow.

02:00.092 --> 02:01.213
It blows up again.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.777
You know, Goethe, you know, the German writer.

02:04.857 --> 02:11.625
Goethe here in the epigraph.

02:11.965 --> 02:24.200
What's the purpose of all the creative power when... Well, I was always amused when they said that existentialism was an invention of, you know... Of course, yes.

02:24.220 --> 02:28.385
But the expression was invented in 1920.

02:28.425 --> 02:30.407
But the concept is highly... You're right.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.610
You're completely right.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.431
You may say that so matters.

02:35.252 --> 02:39.276
And even Buddha was an existential thinker.

02:39.296 --> 02:47.804
I think as soon as we're able to talk, and to think, and to look at the sky, and to know that you will die, then you'll become an existentialist.

02:47.984 --> 02:48.645
You know Buddha?

02:48.685 --> 02:49.386
Yeah, exactly.

02:49.406 --> 02:49.986
You know Buddha?

02:50.246 --> 02:52.328
You know, of course.

02:52.348 --> 02:57.373
Buddha, he was met a man, coming to him, saying,

02:58.113 --> 03:03.920
Mr. Buddha, dear Buddha, why don't you tell us more about life after death?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.903
Why don't you tell, what is your theory, what is your theory, you know?

03:07.324 --> 03:18.156
Vendrida said, if a man is wounded, wounded, wounded by an arrow in the heart, he wouldn't ask, what is this arrow made of?

03:18.516 --> 03:19.818
Who shot this arrow?

03:20.378 --> 03:23.622
What case cost, what did he come from?

03:23.802 --> 03:25.124
Case?

03:26.666 --> 03:27.006
Varnak.

03:27.307 --> 03:31.912
Anyway, he would just ask them to remove him and to heal him.

03:32.393 --> 03:33.053
Thank you.

03:33.194 --> 03:35.776
This is wonderful.

03:35.797 --> 03:37.258
This is very, very nice.

03:37.358 --> 03:40.502
See, that's medium.

03:40.522 --> 03:41.403
You don't want it well done.

03:41.423 --> 03:44.166
No, this was very, very nice.

03:44.747 --> 03:53.356
I'm going to shut this off for a while while we... Say that again.

03:53.376 --> 03:53.757
Say that again.

03:53.777 --> 03:54.898
It will be translated now.

03:55.619 --> 03:55.879
Bull?

03:56.095 --> 04:25.798
in portuguese in portugal and in brazil two different portuguese translations two different portuguese translations and also two different spanish languages and it comes in in japan not that but they have the castellano and what do they say in barcelona they talk some different i don't remember i don't remember and it will be translated into japanese chinese

04:26.707 --> 04:33.797
Korea, Turkey, and of course all the great European languages.

04:35.319 --> 04:37.342
So you really tapped into something, haven't you?

04:37.362 --> 04:37.942
Trapped, yes.

04:39.284 --> 04:42.809
Oh, I thought you said trapped because I feel it in a way to be trapped too.

04:43.170 --> 04:43.951
You do?

04:43.971 --> 04:47.496
That's not what I asked, but I'd love to hear the answer to that.

04:47.516 --> 04:54.625
Because, you know, in a way, I get so many offers I cannot refuse.

04:55.687 --> 04:55.887
You know?

04:56.947 --> 05:06.155
Because I am enjoying this, but I am traveling a little bit more than I love.

05:06.175 --> 05:06.536
You know.

05:06.936 --> 05:07.577
You have children?

05:08.117 --> 05:08.577
Yes.

05:08.598 --> 05:12.821
And my wife is just 100 meters from here.

05:12.941 --> 05:13.462
Yes.

05:14.283 --> 05:24.692
And so, you know, I maybe I thought that actually maybe I should

05:25.060 --> 05:27.365
If we are sitting a little longer, I should go and get her.

05:27.846 --> 05:29.369
She can kind of sit and have a dinner.

05:29.389 --> 05:34.158
Because she expected me about 7 o'clock.

05:34.218 --> 05:34.920
That's 20 minutes.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.441
We'll be done.

05:35.621 --> 05:37.184
Yeah, okay.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.248
But... What are you doing next?

05:40.791 --> 05:43.476
What's next?

05:44.158 --> 05:45.280
I'll...

05:45.648 --> 05:49.032
you can manage to write again, because, you know, of course, everything.

05:49.212 --> 05:49.632
I think so.

05:49.812 --> 05:54.638
And I did, after Sophia's World, write two new novels.

05:54.738 --> 06:03.707
The one is called The Christmas Mystery, and the other is called In the Darkly Mirror.

06:04.028 --> 06:09.454
And so, well, I think mine is protected.

06:10.595 --> 06:13.478
I've been asked now, from the publishing house,

06:13.863 --> 06:21.771
to write a little book, philosophical book, a book for wondering for young children, six years old.

06:21.871 --> 06:22.412
Oh, wonderful.

06:22.432 --> 06:25.234
Because now... Probably the pictures.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.315
Yes, the pictures.

06:26.355 --> 06:34.824
Because earlier, the children, they were seven years old when they went to school, now they are six, in a way.

06:35.284 --> 06:40.950
And then they need something for the six years old people, something to make them curious to learn.

06:42.112 --> 06:43.714
and to read, you know, like that.

06:44.314 --> 06:51.583
But this will be a book without even mentioning names as Socrates and Plato, you know, just a book about the world.

06:53.365 --> 07:08.061
You know, one thing I really should say is that, you know, in Norway and baby here, something has been very common lately, recently, and that is the so-called baby swimming lessons, you know?

07:08.242 --> 07:09.383
We've had them here, right?

07:09.403 --> 07:09.503
Yeah.

07:09.820 --> 07:22.534
What it is about is that you run into a hospital, take this midwife away, and take the kid, run to a swimming pool, throw the kid in the swimming pool, and the kid is not drowning.

07:23.215 --> 07:27.179
Because it's an inborn ability, you know, to manage the water.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.945
I think in the same way, to wonder about life is an inborn ability.

07:34.707 --> 07:37.110
But it has to be pendant.

07:37.310 --> 07:41.075
In a way, to wonder about life is nothing we learn.

07:41.155 --> 07:41.976
It's something we forget.

07:43.058 --> 07:44.820
We don't learn to wonder about life.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.462
We forget to wonder about life.

07:47.323 --> 07:57.257
So, then I think that to wonder about life must depend the truth.

07:57.337 --> 08:02.103
It looks like if we don't learn to swim as babies, we have to go to swimming school.

08:02.123 --> 08:05.848
With these terrible things here, you know, and these things here.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.489
You know, very stupid.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.071
And the same with philosophy.

08:11.032 --> 08:20.843
If you don't start philosophy as young and keep it standard, then we have to go to philosophy school as adults.

08:21.484 --> 08:24.447
Use equipment, water wings, we used to call it.

08:24.467 --> 08:25.048
Exactly.

08:25.068 --> 08:30.814
Then you have to use this language, water wings and all these things.

08:30.835 --> 08:33.878
Very academical, you know.

08:33.993 --> 08:56.576
In a way it sounds very strange that this book on philosophy is written by a man from this little tiny little country Norway.

08:56.676 --> 09:02.042
However, we do have an institution in Norway called Examen Philosophikum.

09:02.326 --> 09:11.315
which all students must pass before they go on studying biology, language, history, anything.

09:12.376 --> 09:19.222
So that means that we have really a great philosophical milieu, you know.

09:19.943 --> 09:30.713
So in Oslo there lives 600,000 people, you know, but there are 60 philosophy teachers, you know, 60 philosophy teachers.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.187
Six, is that a lot?

09:33.367 --> 09:33.707
Sixty.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.730
Sixty, that is a lot.

09:35.810 --> 09:45.101
It's in a town with 600,000 people, and there are 60 philosophy teachers, because it's a student town, and all students have to reflect it.

09:45.122 --> 09:45.402
Maybe.

09:46.043 --> 10:00.040
So my book is, in a way, a reflex of this huge philosophical milieu, in a way.

10:00.060 --> 10:00.160
Okay.
