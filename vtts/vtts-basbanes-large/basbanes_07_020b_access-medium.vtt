WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:06.502
The thing that amazes me is that you had a clear feel for such a long time.

00:06.522 --> 00:06.782
Yes.

00:06.802 --> 00:07.403
It must amaze you.

00:07.423 --> 00:07.684
Yes.

00:08.124 --> 00:08.344
Yes.

00:08.404 --> 00:12.389
I mean, I'm here for eight months in California thinking, gee, what a boy hears about it.

00:12.730 --> 00:13.210
That's right.

00:13.290 --> 00:13.891
That's exactly.

00:13.911 --> 00:14.632
And you know what I heard?

00:14.672 --> 00:16.014
I've never told anyone this before.

00:16.574 --> 00:26.426
But as a matter of fact, after the guy had walked into Michael Slicker's shop, and before Michael Slicker had contacted me, Maury was in a shop.

00:27.167 --> 00:27.348
Nope.

00:27.708 --> 00:28.549
And he didn't mention it.

00:29.150 --> 00:30.932
Maury is also friends of Michael Slicker.

00:31.385 --> 00:39.092
Because he wasn't sure what it was, and he knew I was the expert, and Maury's a general dealer, also a Himalaya collector, but it just sort of slipped his mind.

00:39.132 --> 00:43.916
Michael told me this one day, and you know, I just think, who's ever up there?

00:43.936 --> 00:46.399
I'll tell you, but you might have put your thumb also on another thing.

00:46.499 --> 00:49.562
Maury is known to try and beat the price down.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.024
That may be part of it, you know?

00:52.184 --> 00:56.788
I don't know, but... So it's luck.

00:56.928 --> 00:57.849
You say it's luck?

00:57.869 --> 00:58.370
Providence?

00:58.450 --> 00:58.810
Yeah.

00:59.178 --> 01:00.681
I know, yeah.

01:00.801 --> 01:02.143
Had you bought from this guy before?

01:02.324 --> 01:03.366
Oh, sure.

01:03.386 --> 01:05.129
He had lived in Sacramento when he was younger.

01:05.169 --> 01:15.027
The way I found out about him, when I was getting my license from the city of Sacramento to be a book dealer, you have to have a business license, the cashier said, oh, a rare book dealer.

01:15.428 --> 01:18.052
I used to be married to a man who's an ex-book deal.

01:18.072 --> 01:18.753
I said, oh, who's that?

01:18.773 --> 01:19.614
I said, Michael Slicker.

01:19.674 --> 01:20.916
He now lives in Florida.

01:20.936 --> 01:21.877
Oh, that's great.

01:22.157 --> 01:23.799
And so I wrote Michael Slicker a letter.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.542
This is the ex-wife?

01:25.562 --> 01:26.483
Yeah, this ex-wife.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.785
There's a clerk with a sitter.

01:27.805 --> 01:29.467
Oh, this is how you made the connection with Slicker.

01:31.310 --> 01:33.953
He'd been sending me his catalogs, but I'd kind of forgotten about him.

01:33.993 --> 01:34.895
So I sent him a long letter.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.156
You know, remember me.

01:36.217 --> 01:39.441
I'm still here as a serious Hemingway collector in Sacramento.

01:39.461 --> 01:42.385
And if you ever come across any Hemingway, let me know.

01:42.685 --> 01:44.608
And he would continue to send me his catalogs.

01:44.825 --> 01:46.828
Where in Florida is Slicker?

01:47.049 --> 01:47.670
I might have to call him.

01:47.690 --> 01:47.750
St.

01:47.770 --> 01:48.311
Petersburg.

01:48.471 --> 01:50.674
No problems with my calling him to talk about this.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.016
No, he's a really nice man.

01:52.036 --> 01:54.861
Yeah, I think I will, because I'd kind of like a little bit of the other side.

01:54.921 --> 01:56.864
Lighthouse Books and St.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.725
Petersburg.

01:58.407 --> 02:01.351
I think that kind of covers it, don't you think, Carl?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.753
Can you just show us some of the things?

02:03.935 --> 02:04.496
Yeah, sure.

02:04.697 --> 02:06.900
Oh, yeah, I wanted to show you this.

02:07.302 --> 02:11.026
You know, Hemingway asked Richard Armstrong to do all this research for him, right?

02:11.147 --> 02:11.807
Oh, yeah, indeed.

02:11.827 --> 02:12.088
Yeah, right.

02:12.108 --> 02:25.363
So then we've got two letters, one six-type pages, one seven-type pages, in which he goes into intricate details about these political situations in Havana, Cuba, and some of this stuff comes up almost unchanged into have and have not.

02:26.585 --> 02:27.846
That's pretty good.

02:27.886 --> 02:28.808
That's significant.

02:28.828 --> 02:29.669
Dynamite stuff.

02:29.709 --> 02:30.129
That is.

02:31.090 --> 02:31.631
Okay.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.693
Okay, now I'll go back and show you the Hemingway.

02:33.753 --> 02:34.234
Okay.

02:35.015 --> 02:35.415
Can we come?

02:35.696 --> 02:35.976
Yeah.

02:36.462 --> 02:43.229
We're in your Hemingway room, which is packed.

02:43.649 --> 02:45.231
Everything here is Hemingway.

02:45.251 --> 02:48.995
There's a blurb on a Nelson Algren paperback.

02:49.015 --> 02:49.976
Now, you mentioned Hanneman.

02:49.996 --> 02:51.097
Do you have all of Hanneman?

02:51.798 --> 02:52.999
A and B, at least?

02:53.019 --> 02:53.980
Yeah, I have the books.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.722
Oh, sure.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.724
And I have copies for sale.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.728
What I'm saying for your own personal collection, because generally you'd follow Hanneman.

03:02.248 --> 03:05.912
Oh, I certainly don't have to complete everything.

03:06.128 --> 03:08.872
is in Hanneman, but the room is organized by Hanneman.

03:08.912 --> 03:09.813
These are the A items.

03:10.775 --> 03:16.603
And as you go around the room, you know, chronologically, the way they were published, this is his stuff.

03:20.168 --> 03:21.951
Some of these must be for sale.

03:22.211 --> 03:23.252
Yeah, they're all for sale.

03:23.733 --> 03:29.301
I sell six or seven of these a year, ten of the old men in the sea a year, you know.

03:29.652 --> 03:31.675
Like I said, I'm a major dealer in Hemingway.

03:31.735 --> 03:33.258
Is this it or is that the reprint?

03:33.458 --> 03:34.299
That's the reprint.

03:34.319 --> 03:35.682
I've got the first in the other room.

03:35.702 --> 03:37.284
That's a tough book to get with a jacket.

03:37.464 --> 03:37.945
Yes, it is.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.109
And this has nine stories in it.

03:40.750 --> 03:45.517
You know, the Peter and the Griffon book, which was just published.

03:45.537 --> 03:46.038
Two sides.

03:46.078 --> 03:47.140
Is one of these a book of the month?

03:47.360 --> 03:48.141
Yes, exactly.

03:48.181 --> 03:49.484
This is the first.

03:49.504 --> 03:51.206
And they've got them stories.

03:51.687 --> 03:53.270
Have you ever seen this?

03:53.290 --> 03:53.550
No.

03:54.155 --> 03:55.497
This is the toughest.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.520
We're talking about the Enduring Henley.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.181
Customist item.

03:58.241 --> 03:59.984
An anthology of a lifetime of minutes?

04:00.024 --> 04:00.705
I don't even know it.

04:00.745 --> 04:00.945
Yeah.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.448
You see the book club all the time.

04:02.468 --> 04:03.149
This is the book club.

04:03.289 --> 04:05.272
I have two of the first edition at the price.

04:05.392 --> 04:06.434
It's a Scrivener's, too, huh?

04:06.454 --> 04:11.141
Yeah, it's a Scrivener's, but it just... I never... You're very, very seldom seeing it.

04:11.161 --> 04:11.983
It's not an A item.

04:13.064 --> 04:15.508
I believe it is, because I'll show you why.

04:16.129 --> 04:17.231
It has one thing that's new.

04:17.311 --> 04:17.711
It's an A item.

04:17.731 --> 04:17.892
Exactly.

04:17.912 --> 04:20.375
It's got the African story in it.

04:20.396 --> 04:21.377
So it would be an A item.

04:24.985 --> 04:25.526
There it is.

04:25.846 --> 04:27.008
The African Journal.

04:27.068 --> 04:28.269
First Book of Friends of Life.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.531
That's 571 page.

04:29.591 --> 04:29.971
571.

04:29.991 --> 04:32.975
That's what I'm looking for.

04:33.115 --> 04:35.218
So that's... This is nice.

04:35.238 --> 04:36.099
Those are the poems.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.142
Right.

04:38.162 --> 04:40.685
And this is probably not an A.I.

04:40.705 --> 04:41.866
But an interesting kind.

04:42.627 --> 04:46.713
And then the first... This is his first book published in England.

04:48.695 --> 04:49.676
This one.

04:49.696 --> 04:51.378
Different title, right?

04:51.639 --> 04:52.400
That's nice.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.182
And this is...

04:54.618 --> 04:57.703
real difficult of the British tradition.

05:00.227 --> 05:04.253
I had the editor of this inscribe it from Garden of Eden, Tom Jenks.

05:04.273 --> 05:05.174
Uh-huh.

05:05.314 --> 05:05.955
That's nice.

05:06.536 --> 05:09.100
That's one-third, you know, the original mass.

05:09.301 --> 05:09.641
Right.

05:10.402 --> 05:10.663
Right.

05:10.683 --> 05:12.626
So he is actually kind of a collaborator.

05:13.307 --> 05:16.431
Maybe he's an author.

05:16.451 --> 05:17.453
Yeah.

05:17.990 --> 05:22.798
Okay, so you get all the B items and then the translations and books about them and one over there.

05:22.838 --> 05:25.663
And what do you estimate is in here, about 1,000 books maybe?

05:26.484 --> 05:27.225
Oh, no.

05:27.245 --> 05:28.988
No, I'd say 2,000.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.793
Well, I don't figure that's, three shelves is 100.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.177
They're double shelves.

05:34.237 --> 05:35.579
I bet they're double shelves.

05:35.599 --> 05:36.501
I don't know, maybe 2,000.

05:36.561 --> 05:36.861
Okay.

05:37.022 --> 05:37.723
2,000 items.

05:37.743 --> 05:43.913
And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 bookcases, most of them double shelves, actually more than that.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.855
There are two more.

05:45.915 --> 05:49.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

05:50.942 --> 05:55.047
So you have what amounts to 24 bookshelves worth of stuff.

05:55.748 --> 05:55.848
Yeah.

05:55.868 --> 05:57.410
And the Busters, where'd you get that?

05:57.771 --> 05:58.271
What is that?

05:58.371 --> 05:58.992
I got that.

05:59.413 --> 06:03.258
Some dealer, a small book dealer in Southern California had it.

06:03.278 --> 06:03.398
Right.

06:03.418 --> 06:05.561
It's a numbered, I don't know who did it or when.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.545
And you got all the magazine appearances.

06:08.625 --> 06:09.586
Magazine appearances, right.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.989
You see lying flat.

06:12.009 --> 06:12.109
Yeah.

06:12.129 --> 06:12.550
Okay.

06:13.289 --> 06:20.220
I put out a Steinbeck list.

06:21.001 --> 06:22.564
We call it Steinbeck.

06:22.644 --> 06:23.065
Do you?

06:23.105 --> 06:24.928
I specialize in Hemingway and Steinbeck.

06:24.948 --> 06:26.851
Uh-huh.

06:26.871 --> 06:31.198
And so, Nick Adams was incorporated and not incorporated, but registered?

06:31.218 --> 06:33.040
No, it was Nick Adams and Company Rare Books.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.546
Okay, and when did Nick Adams come into being?

06:36.914 --> 06:39.077
Probably in 87.

06:39.497 --> 06:39.878
Okay.

06:39.898 --> 06:46.847
How come it took, if this deal was consummated two and a half years ago, how come it just broke six years ago, six months ago on the press?

06:47.648 --> 06:48.849
Actually, I think it was about a year ago.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.872
I've got copies of it.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.255
You mean I've had that time story for a year?

06:53.275 --> 06:56.018
Oh, this is a booklet, by the way.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.642
Oh, that's nice.

06:58.662 --> 07:00.264
It's Libris Renis Hemingway.

07:00.624 --> 07:02.807
Matthew Bricoli, or Broccoli, or whatever his name is.

07:02.847 --> 07:03.308
Broccoli.

07:03.628 --> 07:04.529
Broccoli, okay.

07:04.930 --> 07:06.752
Yeah, this is from him.

07:07.255 --> 07:09.458
Morey was the dealer who had it.

07:10.899 --> 07:17.467
It's quite wonderful.

07:20.711 --> 07:23.174
Why don't you describe it for me?

07:23.194 --> 07:28.180
Well, it has the Three Mountains, Three Mountain Press.

07:28.721 --> 07:32.966
It's got a bull, though a man's on a horse.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.389
It's got a scribe, quill pen.

07:35.825 --> 07:37.327
Yeah, his name.

07:37.827 --> 07:40.030
The middle, Ex Libra Serena Center.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.374
Right, it's got a mountain stream, maybe Michigan.

07:45.517 --> 07:47.019
Would you like to describe what that is?

07:47.039 --> 07:52.325
This is an original photograph unpublished and a fragment of a letter at the bottom of it.

07:52.846 --> 07:54.948
It's everything more than L-K-E-H.

07:56.410 --> 08:05.241
I got another original photograph in the front room that someone asked if they could use for

08:05.660 --> 08:12.710
frontispiece of a book, and I've got the book, and I'll show you when I go back out.

08:12.730 --> 08:19.740
I'll show you the photograph of the book.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.705
Yeah, it's a little organizing that needs to be done.

08:23.825 --> 08:27.410
This is incredible.

08:28.031 --> 08:29.473
These are four photographs.

08:29.493 --> 08:34.941
I'll show you the original from which this was made, because it's kind of fun to see what

08:35.410 --> 08:36.672
The art can do.

08:36.692 --> 08:39.796
Now, this is what we started with, okay?

08:39.816 --> 08:43.721
I went to professional photographer and said, make me ten copies.

08:44.161 --> 08:45.603
So, this is one of the ten copies.

08:46.364 --> 08:50.289
And then Peter Hayes asked if he could use one for his book, and I said, yes.

08:50.349 --> 08:50.870
That's great.

08:51.170 --> 08:52.952
And then he gave me credit back there.

08:53.073 --> 08:53.753
Oh, that's nice.

08:54.655 --> 09:00.422
Peter L. Hayes is out there, the limping hero, and he wrote this book, Ernest Temingway by Peter L. Hayes, and it's published by Continuum.

09:00.790 --> 09:06.715
And a jacket photograph used with the kind of permission of David R. Meeker, owner of McAdams Bookstores.

09:06.735 --> 09:08.677
Look at this wonderful picture of Martha.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.000
Who is the woman?

09:12.020 --> 09:12.741
Martha Geltman.

09:13.101 --> 09:14.122
And this is at the Finca.

09:15.363 --> 09:18.106
And that's in the front steps of the Finca.

09:18.446 --> 09:23.271
And this is the back, the back porch kind of thing.

09:23.351 --> 09:24.772
Be careful, be careful.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.012
Okay.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.895
And both of these are the back porch.

09:29.765 --> 09:31.329
I said, is this your copy of the book?

09:31.951 --> 09:33.214
And what did you say?

09:33.234 --> 09:34.076
You said, it's mine.

09:34.397 --> 09:36.322
Yeah, it's mine, and it's for sale.

09:36.482 --> 09:37.365
And it's for sale.

09:37.385 --> 09:37.786
$70,500.

09:37.806 --> 09:38.728
$70,500.

09:41.595 --> 09:43.139
Yeah, I have this made.

09:44.944 --> 09:46.508
And this is his first book.

09:47.332 --> 09:48.594
This is the second book.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.698
In our time, the one we were just holding is the second book.

09:51.738 --> 09:53.180
The very first.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.182
Three stories and ten poems was his first book.

09:55.202 --> 09:56.945
Three stories and ten poems.

09:56.965 --> 09:58.467
And this is a wonderful copy of this.

09:58.587 --> 10:01.350
I have sold a copy of this, another copy, this year.

10:02.372 --> 10:03.713
But this is the best one I have.

10:06.016 --> 10:07.338
And it has paper covers.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.440
It's much more fragile.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.043
And often you see it and it's really beat up.

10:12.865 --> 10:14.888
But this is, I mean, it's a perfect copy.

10:14.908 --> 10:17.271
This is almost a perfect copy.

10:17.487 --> 10:18.108
It's unbelievable.

10:18.949 --> 10:19.831
And this is 13,500.

10:20.692 --> 10:21.053
Say again?

10:21.073 --> 10:21.955
13,500.

10:22.195 --> 10:22.836
Right.

10:22.936 --> 10:23.878
May I just do that?

10:24.218 --> 10:24.679
Oh, sure.

10:25.521 --> 10:27.844
Oh, I've got to do it.

10:28.125 --> 10:35.557
I'm now holding three stories and ten poems in the first book.

10:36.479 --> 10:38.362
Oh, God, it's like an entry to me.

10:38.382 --> 10:41.167
There he is.

10:41.187 --> 10:43.090
I've held the Gutenberg Bible while we've been doing this.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.099
Wow.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.823
That's not about you.

10:46.843 --> 10:49.186
And I sound like I held Samuel Pepys' diary.

10:49.406 --> 10:49.867
Yeah.

10:49.887 --> 10:52.991
He held a letter from George Washington the other day.

10:54.293 --> 10:55.134
Congratulations.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.175
Thank you.

10:56.235 --> 10:58.298
How would you feel when you sell this?

10:58.318 --> 10:59.740
There'll be a big gap.

11:02.003 --> 11:04.727
I had a wonderful copy of The Sun Also Rises.

11:04.747 --> 11:11.376
And one of the first... Theoretically, everything's for sale, right?

11:11.456 --> 11:12.317
One of my core collections.

11:12.820 --> 11:17.945
And this is the first time I took a book from my core collection down to the big book fair in Glendale.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.850
And a dealer came by and bought it.

11:21.870 --> 11:22.510
What did you feel?

11:22.931 --> 11:23.591
I felt bad.

11:24.232 --> 11:35.664
Also, $6,000 and since then, because it's the most sought-after item, in first condition, in Dust Jacket, they've sold as high as $15,000 uninscribed.

11:35.684 --> 11:36.685
The Sunhouse Arise.

11:37.086 --> 11:42.051
Even though there were, I think, 5,000 or 7,000 copies, and these are scarcer.

11:42.368 --> 11:48.775
The Sun House Arises being his most popular in his first great novel, it's very, very difficult to find.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.976
That's a seventh printing.

11:49.996 --> 11:51.938
I've never, what's a seventh printing?

11:51.958 --> 11:52.679
In your hand.

11:52.699 --> 11:53.860
There is a seventh printing.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.082
I've never seen the jacket before.

11:55.102 --> 11:55.863
That's why I took it out.

11:55.903 --> 11:56.143
Right.

11:56.864 --> 12:03.371
But the first printing in Dutch's jacket is an extremely expensive book, and it's the only one that I've sold out of my core collection.

12:03.451 --> 12:05.413
And not replaced.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.177
I've always kind of felt kind of bad, you know, that I let that one go.

12:09.277 --> 12:10.198
And I can't replace it.

12:11.107 --> 12:13.830
You know, because I have to pay retail.

12:13.850 --> 12:14.250
That's the point.

12:14.270 --> 12:21.318
Right now, you maybe put price in maybe what might be considered too high with the hope that nobody will buy them.

12:21.498 --> 12:22.239
I wish I'd done that.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.763
But I didn't.

12:25.783 --> 12:40.438
You know, some of these, in the business, in the book business, if you have a perfect copy, you can pretty much set your own price because the people who've been collecting a long time know that they're going to have to pay like that to get

12:40.621 --> 12:43.244
You know, these are like perfect copies of his first two books.

12:43.284 --> 12:50.694
In fact, his first, you know, I can't imagine that anywhere there exists a better copy of this book in that time we're talking about.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.197
And you acquired these from all different places, right there?

12:53.418 --> 12:54.459
Over the 23 years.

12:54.619 --> 12:59.986
And paid a lot of money at the time and actually went selling for more, hopefully.

13:00.006 --> 13:04.993
Now, what did your bank say when you went and said, did they ask you what you're borrowing the money for?

13:05.573 --> 13:09.058
No, because I put a trust deed on a building, so they didn't know.

13:10.507 --> 13:15.573
Basically, the building's worth it, you can get this much money on a building, so then I have to be able to make the payments.

13:15.993 --> 13:21.099
They look at my credit report, they have to be able to make the payments on the loan I'm making.

13:21.119 --> 13:23.582
And they're convinced I can do that, so they don't care what I do.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.484
Was there ever any doubt in your mind that you should do this?

13:26.625 --> 13:26.866
No.

13:28.748 --> 13:28.948
No.

13:29.369 --> 13:31.311
I mean, maybe that's not the truth.

13:31.711 --> 13:35.856
Yes, there was doubt in my mind, but there was never any doubt in my mind that I was going to do it.

13:36.173 --> 13:37.314
if I could get this stuff.

13:37.354 --> 13:39.277
I mean, I'm talking about this stuff.

13:39.297 --> 13:41.860
I mean, it was basically, I'll pay what I have to pay to get it.

13:43.242 --> 13:45.905
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

13:46.005 --> 13:49.409
I knew that every minute I was there.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.711
And I just didn't want it to get away.

13:50.751 --> 13:53.354
And for eight and a half months, it looked like it was going to get away.

13:53.374 --> 14:01.364
If I were to take out my checkbook, and I'm not about to do this, and say, all right, I'll write you out a check for $17.50 for an hour time, what would you feel?

14:04.368 --> 14:04.628
Well...

14:06.768 --> 14:11.354
I've gone sometimes two and three years and never seen one for sale.

14:12.055 --> 14:17.081
In the last year, the Bradley Martin sale at Sotheby's, there was an inscribed one that sold.

14:17.121 --> 14:18.884
And I know of another one for sale right now.

14:21.727 --> 14:26.894
But, you know, I'm not going to pay that kind of money for one because I'm in the business now.

14:27.394 --> 14:31.780
And to be able to replace it, I don't know when, if ever, I'll have another one.

14:32.587 --> 14:36.871
And the truth is, I bought and sold three stores and ten poems in this last year.

14:36.891 --> 14:43.257
And I've sold two copies of a cup of gold and dust jacket, Steinbeck's first, in the last year.

14:43.277 --> 14:45.318
And Pastors of Heaven, his second book.

14:45.338 --> 14:46.940
So I'm in the business.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.423
I have opportunities to buy collections and single books.

14:50.443 --> 14:51.844
And so they come.

14:52.385 --> 14:59.051
They generally say selling the first one is the toughest collector to a dealer.

14:59.071 --> 15:00.332
And then once that's done, it's

15:00.582 --> 15:02.004
Yeah, it's tiny.

15:02.024 --> 15:04.627
I mean, if I ever sold this stuff, let me put it here.

15:04.867 --> 15:10.374
When I sell this magnificent material, then, you know, I'm a whore, for sure.

15:10.394 --> 15:13.318
You know, I'm not a collector any longer, right?

15:13.338 --> 15:14.379
Do you mind if I use that quote?

15:14.640 --> 15:15.981
No, that's okay.

15:16.001 --> 15:22.610
I mean, really, if I come to use it, it won't surprise you to see it.

15:22.630 --> 15:22.810
No.

15:22.830 --> 15:22.970
Okay.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.254
Do you make money as a book dealer?

15:28.137 --> 15:28.497
Yes.

15:30.181 --> 15:38.612
And, you know, obviously having a full-time job limits the time I can put into it.

15:39.473 --> 15:45.060
On the other hand, I don't have to eat from the results of the book business.

15:45.080 --> 15:50.747
So perhaps I'm not as conscientious as a businessman as someone who does.

15:52.049 --> 15:53.691
But, yeah, I make money at it.

15:55.156 --> 15:57.158
So it's not just an avocation.

15:57.178 --> 15:59.882
And every year, the gross sales are more than a year before.

15:59.982 --> 16:02.224
I've done 40,000 for the first six months of this year.

16:02.244 --> 16:04.327
40,000 sales.

16:04.367 --> 16:04.727
41,000.

16:04.767 --> 16:10.574
That's pretty darn good.

16:10.874 --> 16:12.636
I love book fairs.

16:12.917 --> 16:20.145
The preparation, the work, you know, you work like a dog for two days preparing for a book fair and at the book fair.

16:20.165 --> 16:23.509
But it's fun being at the fair with people who really like books.

16:23.962 --> 16:34.275
and you know just that's i enjoyed it ended up buying and selling you know being there early and going to other dealers and buying books
