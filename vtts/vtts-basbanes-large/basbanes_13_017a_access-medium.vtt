WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:05.404
We're at the Getty with Tom Cranston.

00:05.424 --> 00:07.146
February 1, 2002, right?

00:07.746 --> 00:09.268
Right.

00:09.288 --> 00:12.491
Well, we just, we haven't, we chatted 10 years or so ago.

00:12.691 --> 00:13.391
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:13.411 --> 00:19.917
We were working on The Gentle Madness and you introduced us to the wonderful things that you are a custodian of.

00:20.958 --> 00:21.479
It's my privilege.

00:21.499 --> 00:32.569
Can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing now here at the new center and how your work has expanded over the last 10 years and the direction that you're taking with your work and

00:32.887 --> 00:38.514
Acquisitions and that kind of thing?

00:38.534 --> 00:39.375
Yeah.

00:39.395 --> 00:40.597
Actually, a lot's happened.

00:41.698 --> 00:42.559
A couple things.

00:42.639 --> 00:48.006
One is actually, from the time I bought the wood collection, we've continued to build it.

00:48.026 --> 00:51.291
And actually, at first we bought quite a lot every year.

00:51.311 --> 00:55.796
Now we buy quite a bit less, simply because prices are higher and money.

00:55.936 --> 00:59.821
There's a lot of money, but it goes less far than it did ten years ago.

01:00.542 --> 01:01.864
I'm very keen...

01:02.620 --> 01:06.985
And I've always been very keen to get as many great or major things as we can get.

01:07.646 --> 01:08.948
And so I'm much more inclined.

01:09.168 --> 01:11.371
We grow at a remarkably slow pace.

01:11.411 --> 01:13.073
Sometimes we buy one or two things a year.

01:14.354 --> 01:19.080
But if they're terrific, I'd rather buy one terrific thing in a sense than five things that are pretty good.

01:19.681 --> 01:27.790
Because in a sense, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, long after I'm gone, it probably still will be possible to get pretty good things.

01:27.891 --> 01:29.893
It will always be difficult to get the great things.

01:30.346 --> 01:37.255
Since our collection is very small, we have less than, about 170 objects, that's pretty small.

01:37.616 --> 01:38.457
These are manuscripts?

01:38.497 --> 01:39.438
Yeah, manuscripts.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.601
Illuminated manuscripts.

01:42.121 --> 01:47.509
And these are, how round are these?

01:47.549 --> 01:50.953
I prefer to buy books if I can, but we do buy leaves because

01:51.203 --> 01:54.407
Essentially, everything we buy, we buy with display in mind.

01:54.427 --> 02:01.294
Everything that we buy goes on show eventually and usually ultimately goes on show in some rotation.

02:01.314 --> 02:02.476
So we want to be able to show things.

02:03.036 --> 02:06.941
This collection is really about the history of manuscript painting.

02:07.842 --> 02:15.650
It's a book collection and we're interested in the greatest variety of texts we can buy and the greatest variety of subject matter.

02:16.551 --> 02:19.995
We really are representing, in a sense, the history of medieval painting.

02:20.363 --> 02:22.405
Manuscript Illumination is the great record.

02:22.745 --> 02:25.588
I mean, it's the surviving record of medieval paintings.

02:25.608 --> 02:26.188
Fabulous.

02:26.208 --> 02:26.969
Exactly.

02:27.149 --> 02:28.630
Good, keep going.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.012
Well, anyway, so that's what we do.

02:31.112 --> 02:37.918
So, I mean, we're essentially trying to represent the great schools, the great illuminators, the great subjects where that's possible, too.

02:37.978 --> 02:40.320
You know, I'd love to get a great illuminated Dante.

02:40.701 --> 02:47.347
I mean, I don't have in my little list hidden away a great Dante that's available to be had, but you never know.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.088
Great things come up that are not known.

02:49.827 --> 02:58.261
And, in fact, a number of the major things we've bought in the last few years are things that we're not known or, you know, had been lost for so many years that they were almost forgotten.

02:58.421 --> 02:59.843
Lost in what respect?

03:00.665 --> 03:04.491
Let me just say this book that we're working on and we're talking about here today.

03:04.812 --> 03:07.857
The subtitle is The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

03:07.877 --> 03:12.324
So I'm really interested in things that resurface.

03:12.524 --> 03:13.967
Actually, here's a good story.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.611
I can't tell you all the details just because...

03:16.827 --> 03:19.230
But I'll give you the idea.

03:19.410 --> 03:25.659
We bought about, I can't remember, three years ago maybe, a wonderful paleologian gospel book.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.902
Great Greek manuscript.

03:28.022 --> 03:29.924
I can show it to you.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.889
It's a book that actually I had known about for many years.

03:34.931 --> 03:45.805
When I first started doing this job, whatever, in the early 80s, you start making a list of everything that you'd like to have, of what's out there, what might come up, both to prepare your superiors, that this might come up and it might be expensive,

03:46.173 --> 03:53.200
And also, hopefully, you find out what's happening with them and see whether there's even a chance it will come up.

03:53.280 --> 04:05.553
An intern I had who was a Byzantinist, or actually wasn't a Byzantinist, but he knew the Byzantine material, said, you know, there is this great manuscript that's well-known among scholars, which is well-published, that no one has ever seen.

04:06.554 --> 04:07.895
And I said, well, I mean, how could that be?

04:08.035 --> 04:09.597
How could someone not have seen it?

04:09.617 --> 04:15.943
Turned out, in fact, there's a monograph by Buchdahl and Belting, two of the great Byzantinists, about

04:16.143 --> 04:23.351
about early paleologian manuscript elimination, which illustrates in full this fantastic book, which they had never seen.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.712
That's unbelievable.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.853
Yeah, very interesting story.

04:25.913 --> 04:34.102
And what happened, turns out what happened is a Greek immigrant came to this country at the very beginning of the 20th century, as far as we can determine.

04:35.083 --> 04:44.293
And probably around 1940 or somewhere at a point, he sold the manuscript to a dealer in New York who had it photographed, or somebody had it photographed.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.983
And then the dealer went and sold it to someone else.

04:47.684 --> 04:48.325
No one knew who.

04:48.825 --> 04:50.347
The photographs got into circulation.

04:50.387 --> 04:54.713
There was a curator at the Met who had a set of the photographs and allowed scholars to see them.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.875
And from the photographs, it was clear that this was a major book.

04:57.316 --> 05:02.583
But the book had come and gone so quickly that no scholars, as far as I can tell, had ever actually seen it.

05:02.643 --> 05:05.707
And I believe that the scholar in New York had not even seen it.

05:05.747 --> 05:08.070
She'd only seen the photographs because it was before her time.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.792
It seems to have been before this.

05:10.430 --> 05:12.432
Anyway, it disappeared into a private collection.

05:12.492 --> 05:15.456
It went on to my list of things like, boy, this would be great to have.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.278
I had no clues about it.

05:17.298 --> 05:18.640
I had not a clue about where it was.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.662
I wasn't even sure who the dealer in New York was.

05:20.702 --> 05:23.025
To this day, I'm not sure if I know who the dealer in New York was.

05:25.849 --> 05:27.491
And so I was on my list of things to do.

05:27.571 --> 05:32.236
And I would occasionally ask a scholar, you know, you know about this book.

05:32.256 --> 05:33.298
Everybody knows about this book.

05:33.318 --> 05:34.099
Have you heard anything?

05:34.559 --> 05:35.340
No one had heard anything.

05:36.738 --> 05:47.171
And one day out of the blue, maybe four or five years ago, I got a call from a dealer in Europe who's a very good dealer, but who we've only bought a few things from.

05:47.351 --> 05:48.552
They have illuminated manuscripts.

05:48.632 --> 05:52.517
And we actually have bought a couple of great things from them, but they don't have a lot.

05:52.537 --> 05:54.439
And it's not someone I see even every year.

05:55.100 --> 05:59.185
They said, oh, well, if you're coming to Europe, come over because I think I have something that you really want to see.

06:00.295 --> 06:01.536
And they talk a little bit about it.

06:01.576 --> 06:03.439
Oh, how interesting.

06:03.459 --> 06:06.622
And the thing is, Greek books of any quality, they just don't come up.

06:06.822 --> 06:09.625
I mean, we have a few great Greek books in our collection.

06:09.646 --> 06:10.787
They're all the big manuscripts.

06:10.827 --> 06:12.309
He bought them a long time ago.

06:13.109 --> 06:22.300
We bought a couple of very beautiful South Italian miniatures, which were painted by Greek artists in the 13th century once.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.561
And that's it, a couple of miniatures.

06:23.581 --> 06:24.823
That's all we bought.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.223
So...

06:25.523 --> 06:34.176
you know, the prospect, when any kind of Greek manuscript comes up, even if it doesn't look so good in the photos, I go to see it because it's something that's especially hard to come by.

06:34.196 --> 06:39.163
So anyway, so I went over, I saw it, and, you know, I thought, oh, my God, I mean, I immediately recognized it was the book.

06:41.206 --> 06:43.730
And, I mean, I was flabbergasted.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.853
And, you know, it wasn't too complicated.

06:45.913 --> 06:50.680
We just, you know, there may have been some issue about timing or something, but we got it over as soon as we could.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.763
And we checked it out as well as we could.

06:53.148 --> 06:54.410
I did find out who owned it.

06:54.470 --> 06:59.436
Yes, you know, they wanted to remain confidential, but we wanted to make sure that there was no issue with the provenance.

06:59.456 --> 07:02.059
It seemed all to be absolutely straightforward.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.842
And so we were able to buy it.

07:03.862 --> 07:12.272
And, you know, then we caused a great deal of excitement because there were all these people in the field who, you know, suddenly this book that everyone had known was available.

07:12.412 --> 07:14.215
It caused excitement as an artifact?

07:14.235 --> 07:15.957
How about the content?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.639
It was a pretty straightforward content.

07:17.659 --> 07:19.982
Well, it's a gospel book so that the content's fairly straightforward.

07:20.215 --> 07:22.258
So it's the illuminations of that.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.301
Yeah, it's the quality of illuminations.

07:24.321 --> 07:31.591
I mean, at the end of the day, although we are interested in texts, again, we really buy for the images.

07:31.651 --> 07:44.889
Although, because of the nature of the material, scholars of every, you know, we get art historians, we get economic historians, we get medievalists of every stripe who come to use the collections who are interested in texts or whatever have their own reasons.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.732
We collect primarily for the art.

07:47.152 --> 07:49.075
So this all started with the Olympics.

07:49.696 --> 07:51.259
I'll start with the collection.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.007
Is the collection that you have, I think that was 40-odd books, right?

07:55.368 --> 07:57.152
That was the number.

07:57.172 --> 07:57.753
140.

07:57.813 --> 07:58.595
140?

07:58.615 --> 08:00.519
Yeah, it was big.

08:00.539 --> 08:06.231
And so, and you said it's now, it's really... Well, what we did is, I mean, we deaccessioned mostly non-illuminated.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.757
The collection was not all illuminated manuscripts.

08:08.777 --> 08:09.358
And...

08:10.402 --> 08:14.387
I mean, this is the museum that bought the manuscripts, not some other part of the Getty.

08:14.407 --> 08:17.190
And the trustees from the beginning were interested in building art collections.

08:17.771 --> 08:22.576
So we kept those things that related directly to the history of manuscript illumination.

08:23.337 --> 08:36.072
And other things, they were sold only when it was a situation that we wanted to buy something else that was major in the way of manuscript illumination, so that in a sense it was an equal substitution.

08:36.220 --> 08:40.587
So it's actually something that's helped us add to the collection in a very significant way.

08:40.727 --> 08:50.281
This may be unique in a museum of this stature, but maybe not, but you buy books for display, as you said, and you acquire books.

08:51.042 --> 08:57.212
The motivation here is for display, not necessarily for scholarship.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.073
Is that right?

08:58.253 --> 09:04.843
Well, I think every museum acquires, any museum that acquires

09:05.195 --> 09:07.257
Art of any kind is dedicated to scholarship.

09:09.279 --> 09:15.045
But any art museum, and I think that's true of any art museum, too, any painting on the wall.

09:15.405 --> 09:23.834
Actually, because of the book trial, we've had a number of specialists coming through who actually came to see particular paintings because they happened to be working on some issue having to deal with the paintings collection.

09:26.016 --> 09:30.680
So no, I think we see ourselves as being a highly scholarly institution, and we do what we can to foster.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.542
I mean, art collection is fairly actively published.

09:32.562 --> 09:34.324
I can show you some of the things we've done recently.

09:34.793 --> 09:39.118
But, I mean, we do buy to display.

09:39.198 --> 09:44.363
And what you said originally, which is to say we're probably among the few institutions that buy to display, that's true.

09:44.864 --> 09:52.952
Cleveland Museum, which historically has bought more leaves and cuttings than books, is one of the other great collections that has bought to display.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.134
How about the Walters?

09:54.154 --> 09:57.898
The Walters Display is actively their collection.

09:57.918 --> 09:58.118
Wow.

09:58.351 --> 10:01.575
And actually, the Morgan Library actively displays its collection.

10:01.595 --> 10:08.782
It's not, I think they do it in a more low-profile way, but they always have illuminated manuscripts out, and they do wonderful shows.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.245
And they actually do occasionally fantastic.

10:11.265 --> 10:16.971
You know, they do, the last couple years, last year there was this big show on Jean Foyer, the French Illuminae, which was, did you see that?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.633
Yeah, fantastic show.

10:18.653 --> 10:27.323
And Roger Wick, the curator, there are several curators there, but Roger Wick especially, have done a series of great, he did a show about books of ours a year or two before that, which is fantastic.

10:27.363 --> 10:27.463
Yeah.

10:27.865 --> 10:34.456
So they do it in a slightly different way, but they actually display fairly actively too.

10:34.876 --> 10:45.173
But we definitely, the Getty represents art from antiquity up till 1900, and essentially the Getty's medieval collection is the manuscripts collection.

10:45.433 --> 10:54.548
So we haven't really bought in other parts of medieval up till now, partially because it's pretty difficult to put together a major collection of medieval.

10:55.237 --> 11:12.420
And one of the reasons, one of the justifications for going into the manuscripts collecting area was by buying the Ludwig collection overnight, we had a real collection, you know, a collection that had, that represented, you know, chronologically the span of... That's a great story, your acquisition of that collection.

11:12.961 --> 11:13.281
That's fabulous.

11:13.321 --> 11:15.024
Very fortunate, yeah.

11:15.044 --> 11:17.948
And, you know, in a way, we couldn't have done this without that.

11:17.968 --> 11:23.455
I mean, I like to think we've bought, I mean, I can't be very objective here, but I like to think we've done well building on that collection

11:23.907 --> 11:27.232
But the core of what we are as a collection is still the Lively collection.

11:27.252 --> 11:34.223
The great Autonian manuscripts, the great Romanist manuscripts, the great Gothic manuscripts are things that couldn't be bought anymore.

11:34.243 --> 11:38.229
For this new book that I just did, I have an interview on there with Herbert Tenscher.

11:38.249 --> 11:39.130
Oh, oh, great.

11:39.150 --> 11:41.974
And quite a great profile.

11:42.014 --> 11:42.675
Great storyteller.

11:42.695 --> 11:44.839
I have to send a copy of the new book to Tom.

11:44.859 --> 11:46.061
I think you'd be very interested in seeing it.

11:46.081 --> 11:46.581
Oh, I would.

11:48.484 --> 11:49.566
I'll mail it to you.

11:49.586 --> 11:51.028
Oh, yeah, please.

11:51.194 --> 12:01.852
Anyway, one of the things Tentred says is that there are perhaps, and I forgot the precise number, maybe 200 illuminated manuscripts in the world still on the market.

12:01.872 --> 12:10.547
Would you... Maybe 200 great ones or 200... Medieval manuscripts, I think you should talk specifically from the medieval period.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.870
Well, actually, I mean, there are thousands that are still remaining.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.615
The question is, how many would you want to own to display it?

12:16.118 --> 12:21.391
I mean, when I say we buy... Literally, we're just buying a couple things a year at this juncture.

12:22.473 --> 12:26.282
I mean, we're passing out... We're sifting through dozens of manuscripts that come up.

12:26.904 --> 12:29.209
It's just that how... Are we talking about leaves or books?

12:29.590 --> 12:30.312
Both.

12:30.513 --> 12:30.833
Leaves.

12:30.853 --> 12:33.199
You know, sort of a combination of good... At the moment, I have...

12:33.736 --> 12:40.085
Actually, at the moment, I have from three different groups of leaves, but I just was talking to a dealer in Europe today, and he said, well, there are a couple.

12:40.105 --> 12:42.749
Would you believe, did you hear about this book that's been discovered, blah, blah?

12:43.290 --> 12:45.193
So, I mean, no, the books are still around.

12:45.213 --> 12:49.339
I'll show you something that we bought last summer that, you know, was unknown.

12:49.720 --> 12:56.310
I mean, actually, in the 19th century, it belonged to the Duke Dommal, one of the great, great collectors, great bibliophile collectors.

12:57.171 --> 12:59.354
I probably saw his name, the Duke.

12:59.374 --> 13:02.038
Dommal, A-U-M-A-L-E.

13:03.267 --> 13:10.896
It's the Chantilly, Duc de Maul was the one who built the collection of Chantilly, Musée Condé, which is one of the great manuscripts collections today.

13:11.196 --> 13:15.381
It's the one that has the Tres Reserves, the Duc de Berry, and Ingeborg Salter, and that.

13:16.263 --> 13:22.430
So, but he had books in the 19th century that he didn't keep, including some that were wonderful, and we just bought one.

13:22.450 --> 13:23.832
But it seems to have been unrecorded.

13:23.872 --> 13:24.212
It was...

13:24.445 --> 13:25.927
You know, I have no record of it.

13:26.087 --> 13:28.290
What's your reaction when you hear about something?

13:28.310 --> 13:30.012
Does this happen more often than what you do?

13:30.032 --> 13:31.414
Well, actually, that was a funny story.

13:31.554 --> 13:38.023
I was in Paris in last May early doing some research for this exhibition and seeing what was coming up.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.124
I didn't hear a word about it.

13:39.885 --> 13:53.203
I got back, and then I got a phone call of someone there who looks out for these things, and she said, well, there's this manuscript coming up that you've never heard of, and I went to see it, and it looks wonderful, and you must come and see it, and the sale is at the end of June.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.493
And so, like, I've been back for two weeks.

13:55.513 --> 13:56.314
I jumped on the plane.

13:56.674 --> 14:01.619
I went over for a day to look at it, and I came right back because I was busy doing other things.

14:02.320 --> 14:08.847
You know, and it was a fantastic thing, and I went through the procedures here to get the museum behind it, and we bought it at auction.

14:08.867 --> 14:09.848
You're talking about exhibitions.

14:09.868 --> 14:13.232
The one that you have here now has been getting some wonderful notices.

14:13.252 --> 14:13.432
Oh, good.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.514
I think, yeah, we're very excited.

14:15.534 --> 14:16.956
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

14:16.976 --> 14:17.796
This is reading.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.379
This is a reading concept that you have.

14:20.439 --> 14:20.920
Right.

14:21.701 --> 14:23.022
What we try to do is...

14:23.322 --> 14:28.168
What we do with our collection is we try to show it, as I said, aggressively.

14:28.448 --> 14:35.156
We want the museum's visitors to learn about medieval painting and medieval manuscripts.

14:36.658 --> 14:39.962
We try also to be very conservation conscious, so we do four shows a year.

14:40.062 --> 14:41.944
We rotate the shows.

14:42.405 --> 14:47.811
And we could just sort of randomly pick 20 manuscripts every quarter and just stick them up them.

14:48.162 --> 14:50.286
And if they're beautiful, that would be fine.

14:50.687 --> 14:57.780
But what we try to do, since manuscripts is also an area where people come to art museums, they don't necessarily expect to see illuminated manuscripts.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.509
And for many visitors to the Getty, I think, they've never seen anything like this before.

15:03.282 --> 15:10.333
It seems like if you tell people that a book is written by hand, you give a tour at the beginning of the tour, you say, I'm going to show you some books that are written by hand.

15:10.914 --> 15:24.936
At the end of the tour, many things may have registered, but that won't, because it's almost unimaginable for people who are used to the cheapness of books and the fact that everything is printed and even the computer today, to think that someone would go to the trouble of writing a book by hand, or even that they had to.

15:24.916 --> 15:31.989
So there are very basic things about manuscripts that you feel like you have to, that you want to make clear or surprise people of.

15:32.090 --> 15:36.919
So one of the points of this show is simply to talk about what was a medieval book.

15:36.939 --> 15:39.824
I mean, what was it physically, but also what was it in the culture?

15:40.225 --> 15:42.149
How rare an object was it?

15:42.489 --> 15:44.393
In fact, at the beginning of the show, you'll see

15:45.149 --> 15:52.302
We put the sort of historically fundamental vehicles for the written word in one case, which is papyrus.

15:52.523 --> 15:54.085
That's exactly what we're writing about.

15:54.105 --> 16:00.998
Yeah, papyrus, you know, the manuscript, the printed book, and then an e-book, because the future is... I told you.

16:00.978 --> 16:02.000
So you know.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.704
No, this is what I'm writing about.

16:05.124 --> 16:07.488
This is what I'm researching.

16:07.548 --> 16:08.049
Oh, okay.

16:08.069 --> 16:10.272
I'll be curious to hear what you think about this.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.756
Is there a catalog of the exhibition?

16:12.876 --> 16:14.378
There's a brochure, actually.

16:14.398 --> 16:15.720
We'll get it up there.

16:15.820 --> 16:20.427
I thought there might be something we could purchase.

16:20.547 --> 16:25.615
Also, again, because we do so many shows in a year, we tend to do just brochures.

16:25.635 --> 16:28.960
I mean, we do do publications, but that's a lot of catalogs.

16:29.881 --> 16:30.242
So...

16:30.779 --> 16:32.702
And if you look at the back cover, actually.

16:34.926 --> 16:37.049
Look at the photograph, actually, at the back.

16:39.353 --> 16:44.761
Part of the point of the show is that reading is ubiquitous today, but it wasn't in the Middle Ages.

16:45.062 --> 16:49.829
And so the show deals with that issue of who are the audiences, you know.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.211
How did you come up with that?

16:51.492 --> 16:55.057
Well, actually, this is, I can't take credit for this.

16:55.338 --> 16:56.820
An intern...

16:57.239 --> 16:58.882
We have an internship program.

16:58.902 --> 17:01.005
We get an advanced graduate student every year for nine months.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.771
And over the years, we used to assign people topics.

17:05.532 --> 17:07.655
More and more, I think, our interns are getting more and more clever.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.903
They often come up with topics themselves, and this was her idea, and she worked on it, and we worked on it with her.

17:13.744 --> 17:18.512
And it just seems to have worked on it very well.

17:18.532 --> 17:22.858
So what we try to do is we try to show the collection in as many ways as possible.

17:22.878 --> 17:25.322
We have an intern now who's doing a show

17:25.538 --> 17:26.699
about the Greek manuscripts.

17:26.719 --> 17:29.983
We have very few Greek manuscripts, but they're pretty wonderful.

17:30.824 --> 17:35.289
And in a sense, it's such a small group that you can't do a show just on Greek manuscripts at the Getty.

17:35.770 --> 17:44.781
So she's doing a show called Byzantium in the West, in which she will talk about Greek manuscript illumination and the way it was influential in Germany and Italy and different parts of Europe.

17:45.441 --> 17:46.402
And it's very, very interesting.

17:46.423 --> 17:52.870
And it'll include paintings because, especially in Italy in the 13th century, Greek style was very, very influential.

17:52.890 --> 17:55.393
And we have a couple of fantastic examples in our collections.

17:55.812 --> 18:01.719
So again, another thing that we try to do is we try to show books as part of an artistic culture.

18:02.139 --> 18:07.045
So we will show manuscripts with photographs because here actually it makes an interesting point.

18:07.385 --> 18:12.371
We'll show manuscripts with paintings because sometimes the painters and illuminators were the same artists.

18:12.731 --> 18:15.414
A book painter didn't necessarily just paint books.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.996
He might have designed stained glass.

18:17.016 --> 18:18.117
He might have designed tapestries.

18:18.137 --> 18:20.740
He might have made altarpieces.

18:21.445 --> 18:27.614
So I'm very much interested in situating the book in a kind of artistic culture.

18:28.255 --> 18:33.804
Do you emerge from this as a medievalist or a paleographer?

18:33.844 --> 18:35.727
What's your background to come into this?

18:36.087 --> 18:37.870
I would say I'm a medieval art historian.

18:38.170 --> 18:42.677
Actually, my colleagues would probably say I'm a late medieval art historian because my specialty is we collect...

18:43.028 --> 18:44.731
Anything that's terrific, that's medieval.

18:44.751 --> 18:46.414
Anything that's terrific.

18:46.434 --> 18:47.056
No, we try to.

18:47.096 --> 18:48.138
I mean, that's what we try to do.

18:48.759 --> 18:50.402
That's a great mandate, isn't it?

18:50.422 --> 18:51.203
Anything that's terrific.

18:51.223 --> 18:51.965
No, that's what they want.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.209
We try.

18:54.229 --> 19:05.290
Could you say that when you think of how varied the Getty is in so many different areas, that you are able to do, and I hate to use this phrase, the interdisciplinary approach, but you are able to pose.

19:05.590 --> 19:07.652
We do, and we do, actually.

19:07.672 --> 19:08.914
It just made me think.

19:08.954 --> 19:11.156
You're saying, well, we've got these wonderful paintings over here.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.638
We've got these manuscripts over here.

19:12.698 --> 19:13.880
You might have some stained glass.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.762
I don't know if you have any stained glass here or not.

19:16.202 --> 19:17.524
Not yet, but I hope something.

19:17.544 --> 19:18.385
But there you go.

19:18.405 --> 19:22.810
So you'll be pulling in tapestries, whatever, to kind of get a cultural sense.

19:22.830 --> 19:23.371
And it really works.

19:23.451 --> 19:34.804
Actually, when you go upstairs, there's a terrific show that doesn't have manuscripts, but called the Grand Tour, which is mostly about Englishmen going to Italy in the 18th century and what they bought and what they saw and what they did.

19:35.054 --> 19:36.636
And they've actually pulled together drawings.

19:36.656 --> 19:39.479
They've actually pulled together some illustrated books from GRI.

19:40.260 --> 19:48.250
That's one thing, actually, that we've done, is we've done wonderful shows where we put illuminated manuscripts together with illustrated books for the specific theme in mind.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.753
And they have a wonderful collection of illustrated books.

19:50.773 --> 19:51.473
What is GRI?

19:51.614 --> 19:55.038
The Research Institute, Marsha, the library of the Research Institute.

19:55.318 --> 19:56.579
So you might actually ask her about that.

19:56.599 --> 20:02.226
We've done a number of shows with Marsha and their people.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.232
And again, we try to... Well, you'll see.

20:04.492 --> 20:05.634
You'll get a sense.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.418
Some of their things are on view up in the Grand Tour exhibition.

20:09.119 --> 20:11.903
And that's actually one of the exciting things about the Getty.

20:11.963 --> 20:14.487
Although, you know, we started this collection very late.

20:14.787 --> 20:15.969
It's a small collection.

20:16.610 --> 20:21.517
In certain areas, it's incredibly rich, and you can put together things from different media.

20:22.418 --> 20:22.858
You know what?

20:22.999 --> 20:23.840
Let me show you something.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.522
Don't move.

20:25.542 --> 20:26.504
I'll come right back.

20:27.225 --> 20:27.505
Come on.

20:29.543 --> 20:30.725
Well, thank you.

20:30.965 --> 20:33.208
Well, while we're here, it's a little toshka.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.492
You're very kind.

20:36.872 --> 20:39.716
Anyway, this is one of the great manuscripts in the collection.

20:40.477 --> 20:42.419
Let me just write that down a little.

20:42.439 --> 20:44.863
It's called The Model Book of Calligraphy by Joris Hufnagel.

20:48.327 --> 20:51.771
It's probably in here somewhere.

20:51.791 --> 20:53.053
And you say that's one of the great manuscripts?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.791
Yeah, it's one of the great manuscripts in the collection.

20:55.811 --> 20:58.575
And obviously it's all, it's these wonderfully naturalistic flowers.

20:58.635 --> 21:04.063
So the crowd pleaser, the public, you know, loves it.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.385
It applies to people like flowers.

21:05.505 --> 21:06.947
Right, exactly.

21:06.967 --> 21:15.399
And Hoeknagel occupied a very, very interesting position because he belonged to a culture of artists and scientists.

21:15.539 --> 21:20.106
I mean, this is in a sense, this is the 16th century great period for the sort of emergence of botany and botanical studies.

21:20.126 --> 21:23.631
It's the great period of these great printed, illustrated natural histories.

21:24.438 --> 21:26.500
And it's the sort of cultural milieu.

21:26.601 --> 21:34.790
I mean, he worked at the court of Rudolf II, the Habsburg emperor, who was a great patron of both scientific and artistic studies of his time.

21:35.211 --> 21:42.099
He was an heir to someone like Durer, who made great nature studies at the beginning of the 16th century.

21:42.119 --> 21:43.881
He copied him and he imitated him.

21:45.123 --> 21:46.284
And G.R.I.

21:46.344 --> 21:49.648
has a fantastic collection of 16th century natural history.

21:49.668 --> 21:53.753
He's unbelievably beautiful and meticulous, engraved, illustrated text.

21:54.020 --> 22:01.028
that will show you a squid blown up 20 times in great detail, or flowers, or different kinds of beasts and animals.

22:01.429 --> 22:08.637
So we did kind of a focus show with this manuscript at the center, surrounded by these large, glorious, illustrated natural history books.

22:09.057 --> 22:19.289
We have a wonderful Durer watercolor of an insect, which actually was copied by Hufnagel, which just happens to belong to us, so we had that in the show.

22:19.329 --> 22:21.732
We had...

22:22.471 --> 22:27.957
And we also have, Hoofnagel was considered to be one of the sort of seminal figures in the emergence of Dutch still life painting.

22:28.478 --> 22:31.020
And we have some wonderful early Dutch still life paintings in the show.

22:31.341 --> 22:45.677
So in one exhibition we did, which was about illuminated manuscript, we had illustrative printed books, we had watercolor drawings, we had Dutch still life paintings to try to sort of recreate this cultural milieu in the second out of the sixteenth century.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.380
And it's a very fun exhibition.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.761
You were saying earlier that

22:50.483 --> 22:51.384
We started late.

22:51.744 --> 22:57.630
You mean in terms of collecting manuscripts and— Almost anything, collecting almost anything old today.

22:57.710 --> 23:06.639
What kind of pressure did that—or how does that make you innovate, improvise, I guess, as a collecting institution?

23:07.320 --> 23:15.748
Well, it makes me—I can't speak for my colleagues, but I think actually probably in general there's a sense of the Getty that the pressure is to

23:16.049 --> 23:21.637
museums are remembered or understood or appreciated on the basis of their best items.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.681
I mean, the most beautiful, highest quality, most interesting things.

23:25.182 --> 23:34.955
And so I think the pressure to sort of sift through and make sure that you're buying the things that people are going to still care about 20 years from now is probably the greatest thing.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.239
And that's what I'm trying to do.

23:37.259 --> 23:45.330
I mean, I hope that I can't be the judge because in a sense the audience is much larger for me about whether I'm successful or not.

23:45.833 --> 23:56.646
But that's the goal, is for people to think, you know, at the end of the day, the Getty's one of the great collections of illuminated manuscripts, or the Getty's one of the marvelous collections of paintings, or one of the great collections of old masters.

23:56.666 --> 24:04.014
I mean, all of us want to have a collection that at the end of the day, people say, well, you've got to go there, because they have these items that nobody else has.

24:04.054 --> 24:08.159
So they have this group of things, which is a wonderful collection.

24:08.179 --> 24:12.204
And another thing you said earlier is that I'm on my want list.

24:12.224 --> 24:13.225
So you actually have a...

24:13.542 --> 24:17.127
a list of, a dream list, maybe, of things that are out there.

24:17.148 --> 24:18.770
Yeah, I think everybody, our curators have things.

24:18.790 --> 24:25.600
But you must have an idea of things that are, therefore, they're available in other institutions or they're owned by collectors.

24:25.661 --> 24:27.964
Yeah, institutions rarely sell.

24:28.044 --> 24:31.610
So, therefore, you must have a sense of what's out there in private hands.

24:32.331 --> 24:34.174
I see that as being part of my job.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.998
So, trying to simply learn what's out there.

24:37.378 --> 24:39.702
And the interesting thing is, no matter how hard

24:40.002 --> 24:43.345
And there are ways to do that simply by knowing the literature of the history of art.

24:43.645 --> 24:46.007
Anything that comes up as private collection, you go.

24:46.027 --> 24:50.331
And sometimes it doesn't take a lot of difficulty to find out where something like that is.

24:51.052 --> 24:58.599
But the amazing thing is, even in the Ludwig collection, he bought a number of major things that were completely unknown when they came up.

24:58.779 --> 25:06.226
And in a sense, part of the hope for the future, as it were, is that those kinds of things will still continue to come up.

25:06.386 --> 25:07.127
That's a great quote.

25:07.147 --> 25:08.608
They could be in collections.

25:09.247 --> 25:13.951
Oh, yeah.

25:14.632 --> 25:16.094
Well, it's part of the fun of collecting.

25:16.294 --> 25:38.595
I mean, in a sense, there's a certain satisfaction for pursuing something that you know is out there, and sometimes one of the greatest things in the collection I knew about from the moment I started the job, and I always hoped, and I'd actually been advised by some dealers that I thought, well, this may come up pretty soon, and it never quite did, and it never quite did, and then it almost did, and it didn't, and it went on for years and years, and it was about

25:38.963 --> 25:42.689
It must have been about 14 years, and finally it actually really did come up.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.731
Can you tell us what it is?

25:43.751 --> 25:44.572
The Stammheim Missal.

25:44.592 --> 25:44.692
Okay.

25:45.534 --> 25:53.206
I mean, it was, in 1983, probably the most famous manuscript ever to be auctioned was sold, the Gospels of Henry the Lion.

25:53.226 --> 25:53.787
Do you remember that?

25:53.807 --> 25:54.248
Yes, I do.

25:54.408 --> 25:55.450
Made like $12 million.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.233
Yes, I have it.

25:57.774 --> 26:04.144
And I desperately wanted to buy it, but the decision was made internally that because it was great,

26:04.411 --> 26:11.958
treasure, German treasure, and the Germans, you know, it's really one of the greatest of all German illuminated manuscripts, because they wanted it very badly that the Getty wouldn't do it.

26:12.679 --> 26:20.406
And its curator, because curators are all greedy, I mean, I was terribly disappointed, because it was really one of those sort of, you know, cramping out of things.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.267
Yeah, exactly.

26:22.087 --> 26:32.477
And after the sale, a dealer said to me, well, you know, it's a shame that this didn't work out, but I know something from the same period and the same place, and it's better.

26:33.031 --> 26:33.692
Come on.

26:33.952 --> 26:35.634
Which is what I said.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.317
That was just the right response.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.740
And, I mean, you have to judge for yourself.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.061
It's a fantastic object.

26:41.081 --> 26:43.685
And in fact, it was a book that was well published and well known.

26:43.705 --> 26:47.450
It was even in some of the surveys of Roman Esgard, the Shammai Missal.

26:48.992 --> 26:51.235
And he said, well, you know, it's still in the family.

26:51.295 --> 26:54.960
It's been in this family for whatever, I don't know, six or eight hundred years.

26:56.702 --> 26:56.862
Amazing.

26:57.280 --> 27:03.529
It was in one family since the French Revolution, so 200 years.

27:03.549 --> 27:05.151
It was in the monastery for 600 years.

27:05.872 --> 27:07.034
Have you written anything on this?

27:07.074 --> 27:10.499
Yeah, actually, sure.

27:10.519 --> 27:14.545
This gets into the next... ...for two reasons.

27:14.565 --> 27:19.652
One is, and this is one of the things I think that makes it very interesting to do what we do.

27:20.273 --> 27:23.238
This is a manuscript that was made for the Monastery of St.

27:23.278 --> 27:24.840
Michael, Benedictine Monastery.

27:25.090 --> 27:29.594
in Hildesheim in the 12th century, in the second half of the 12th century.

27:29.614 --> 27:33.578
For 200 years already, that monastery had been one of the great centers of art patronage.

27:34.099 --> 27:44.769
There was a guy named Bernward, who had been the abbot in the early 11th century, who commissioned some of the greatest, the famous bronze column and bronze doors at Hildesheim.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.551
They're among the great medieval objects of metal work that he commissioned.

27:48.372 --> 27:53.697
And this book, which is now made 100 years after he died, it was probably the last great object from Hildesheim,

27:54.166 --> 27:57.392
He actually has a portrait of him because he was in the process of being beatified.

27:57.752 --> 27:59.215
So that was quite astonishing.

27:59.996 --> 28:02.060
Anyway, it's a very richly illustrated book.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.923
Fantastic quality, fantastic condition.

28:04.304 --> 28:09.754
It was made for this monastery and had been in the monastery until the French Revolution and the secularization of the monastery.

28:10.194 --> 28:11.857
So for 600 years in one place.

28:12.879 --> 28:12.959
Wow.

28:12.979 --> 28:17.327
When the monastery was secularized, the monks basically walked off at the library.

28:17.407 --> 28:19.110
They probably shaved it.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.529
Well, yeah, exactly.

28:21.609 --> 28:22.009
Exactly.

28:22.329 --> 28:31.738
And the Prince-Bishop of Paderborn, who was the titular head of the monastery and the most powerful political figure in the area, walked off to the greatest of the manuscripts, which was this.

28:31.758 --> 28:31.838
Wow.

28:31.858 --> 28:33.340
And it descended in his family.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.182
This is all in this book, you think?

28:35.202 --> 28:36.903
Probably not, actually.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.705
I don't know if she talks about that.

28:39.506 --> 28:41.267
But I can check out some of it.

28:41.287 --> 28:47.173
Anyway, so it descended through his family, and actually, and that was the Firstenberg, one of the branches, the noble Firstenberg family in

28:47.390 --> 28:51.975
Germany has several branches, but it descended through one of those branches, and we bought it from the family directly.

28:52.795 --> 28:55.878
So we're actually the third owner of this book in eight hundred years.

28:56.059 --> 28:56.399
Wow.

28:56.979 --> 29:08.511
And if you think about it, the family did lend it occasionally to an exhibition, very often, but a couple of times, over the course of the last century, as the book became known.

29:08.531 --> 29:09.051
And you got it.

29:09.612 --> 29:10.192
And we got it.

29:10.232 --> 29:15.878
And you, Tom Crindon, you... Well, I'm merely a servant.

29:16.145 --> 29:25.136
Which is really quite... But that's part of the excitement of... So, but if you think about it, and this is the part that I find exciting, we put it on view for three months.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.501
And actually, we bought it just before we moved here.

29:28.521 --> 29:34.789
So it was on view at the New Getty, where the first year there were almost 1.8 million people, large numbers of people.

29:35.429 --> 29:42.979
Probably by the time we had shown this book once or twice, more people had seen it in California than had seen it in the previous 800 years.

29:43.297 --> 29:47.582
And one of the great things about, I mean, I'm a real populist when it comes to the idea of museums.

29:47.982 --> 30:01.417
One of the things that art museums do that is incredibly important is they bring treasures, artistic treasures, which almost always had been available only to a narrow audience to the widest possible audiences.

30:01.437 --> 30:04.820
And people often criticize art museums as being these very, very elite institutions.

30:05.181 --> 30:11.127
But what other institutions make this kind of rarefied, precious, fantastic object

30:11.427 --> 30:13.449
available to the widest possible audience.

30:13.469 --> 30:14.911
Now, this raises a question.

30:14.951 --> 30:15.631
Very interesting.

30:16.452 --> 30:19.696
You mentioned earlier that Très de Deuverie, I guess.

30:19.716 --> 30:19.916
Right.

30:19.936 --> 30:22.118
Now, nobody is ever allowed to see that.

30:22.138 --> 30:24.261
Even scholars can't go in and see it, isn't that right?

30:24.281 --> 30:26.423
No, I know some people have seen it, but it's pretty difficult.

30:26.443 --> 30:26.903
All right.

30:26.943 --> 30:34.071
But when you say they put out a beautiful facsimile for people to see, but you can't see the real thing.

30:34.091 --> 30:34.632
Right, no, no.

30:34.652 --> 30:35.312
It's not the same thing.

30:35.332 --> 30:36.654
You show them the real thing.

30:36.894 --> 30:37.795
We show them the real thing.

30:38.155 --> 30:39.797
Why the real thing and not a facsimile?

30:41.026 --> 30:44.151
because the difference is very great.

30:44.711 --> 30:46.074
Tell me, what is it?

30:46.094 --> 30:51.321
Even if they make it look... I shouldn't... We're onto something here.

30:51.842 --> 30:52.203
Yeah.

30:56.469 --> 31:01.937
I mean, it's an aesthetic thing, but... I can't even say the other it is.

31:01.957 --> 31:02.438
Here, sorry.

31:02.598 --> 31:03.079
I just saw this.

31:03.099 --> 31:04.481
Forgive me.

31:04.501 --> 31:07.185
Please close the microphone.

31:10.507 --> 31:20.937
It's an ecstatic thing.

31:21.237 --> 31:32.768
We were talking about a facsimile.

31:32.848 --> 31:40.075
I mean, I did actually once a facsimile from a great publisher who does a wonderful job and actually printed a facsimile

31:40.375 --> 31:41.657
in ten colors.

31:42.178 --> 31:45.402
Very, very careful and laborious and expensive in a lot of respects.

31:45.422 --> 31:49.047
I won't name names, but a wonderful thing.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.850
They did a wonderful job.

31:51.270 --> 31:59.682
And when the thing was done, when the book was done, there was a kind of ceremony and a presentation of the final results.

32:00.564 --> 32:05.971
And when they did the presentation, they actually brought out the real book and they brought out the facsimile.

32:06.452 --> 32:09.336
But they put the two of them in different cases about ten feet apart.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.232
They didn't put them next to each other.

32:11.632 --> 32:15.457
When you compare them, you put them 10 feet apart or whatever, 20 feet apart.

32:16.058 --> 32:17.160
No, it was in Europe.

32:17.220 --> 32:19.883
One of our manuscripts was a manuscript in Europe.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.327
And they really had done a wonderful job.

32:22.347 --> 32:31.899
But the reason in my reading of why they put them so far apart was at the end of the day, you put a facsimile together with the real thing, and it's not the same thing.

32:31.919 --> 32:34.823
Can you tell us what the manuscript was back then?

32:35.063 --> 32:39.289
Yes, a calendar manuscript by Simon Benning, a 16-century manuscript manuscript.

32:39.826 --> 32:49.181
And I'm not—and I think they really did do a wonderful job, and it's a—and they have a very—it's an operation that has great integrity, and they do—they do the best that one can do.

32:49.722 --> 32:52.746
But at the same time, it's not the same thing as the original.

32:52.766 --> 33:03.403
And as a scholar, does it mean something to handle the real thing as opposed to—or is it because it's mainly an aesthetic thing that gives us a certain love?

33:03.890 --> 33:22.358
Well, I think at the end of the day, even if for technical examination of a manuscript, if you're trying to see an erased inscription or an inscription that's simply vain or difficult to read or the actual state of something, the surface, that's something you can get in a facsimile.

33:22.619 --> 33:32.614
I mean, at the end of the day, an illuminated manuscript is something written on parchment, a very particular kind of material, a very particular personality and character in paper, which is what

33:32.932 --> 33:35.535
facsimiles are printed on something quite different.

33:36.136 --> 33:42.984
And as I say, I feel very strongly that the level and quality of facsimiles today is amazingly high and amazingly sophisticated.

33:43.345 --> 33:44.286
It's still not the same thing.

33:44.346 --> 33:45.067
It's still the difference.

33:45.087 --> 33:49.031
And it's often the subtlety of those differences that matter.

33:49.051 --> 33:53.437
In fact, a good story along that line is from the point of view of scholarship rather than display.

33:54.258 --> 34:00.245
We bought this Boccaccio manuscript for the region.

34:00.265 --> 34:02.027
I'm just checking to make sure we're fine.

34:02.868 --> 34:08.436
We bought an early 15th century Parisian Boccaccio manuscript, something that was on my list that I'd wanted forever and ever to buy.

34:08.857 --> 34:12.262
And finally, suddenly, it just, all the pieces came together and we were able to buy it.

34:12.302 --> 34:13.344
It was incredibly exciting.

34:14.385 --> 34:22.477
And it belongs to a group of illuminated French Boccaccio manuscripts in this period, about which a great deal was known.

34:22.878 --> 34:25.121
And there were three major ones, and this was one of three.

34:25.822 --> 34:28.025
One, we know, was made for the Duke de Berry.

34:28.386 --> 34:29.888
One was made for the Duke of Burgundy.

34:30.425 --> 34:32.047
But ours, it wasn't dead.

34:32.067 --> 34:32.668
There were no marks.

34:32.688 --> 34:35.392
There was no clear indication who it was made for, so we thought.

34:36.915 --> 34:47.290
Anyway, a scholar who actually happens to be here in town at the moment, Andy Hediman from the University of Champaign-Urbana in Illinois, was interested in working on them.

34:47.310 --> 34:50.315
I actually came out to look at it, and she discovered what looked like an erased signature.

34:52.037 --> 34:55.943
And we went into the lab and did a kind of enhancement.

34:56.513 --> 35:01.920
We photographed it, and I did a kind of computerized enhancement of the image to get as much of the signature out as we can.

35:01.940 --> 35:05.806
And she could only identify the last three or four letters of the signature.

35:05.826 --> 35:10.412
She couldn't see the whole thing, but had very elaborate and distinctive pen flourishes and condolences or whatever.

35:10.712 --> 35:11.774
I mean, very, very elaborate.

35:11.954 --> 35:12.995
There were lots of bits of it.

35:13.015 --> 35:15.819
You just couldn't get the whole name.

35:17.361 --> 35:20.666
She told me this story quickly the other day when we were both in a hurry.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.507
What's her name, by the way?

35:21.527 --> 35:23.630
Her name is Andy Hediman.

35:23.710 --> 35:24.071
A-N-D-I?

35:24.431 --> 35:25.913
Yeah, it's actually Anne Hediman.

35:26.230 --> 35:27.492
A capital B period.

35:27.512 --> 35:30.997
She's an A-T-E-D-E-M-A-N-N.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.963
A-T-E-D-E-M-A-N-N.

35:34.983 --> 35:35.684
That's a good story.

35:35.944 --> 35:37.026
Yeah, it's a very interesting story.

35:37.787 --> 35:49.263
Anyway, she somehow, using the last three letters of the name, tried to go through the names of all the people at the French court, because that would be the likely area of patronage, to figure out who it could have been.

35:49.584 --> 35:51.006
And she came up with a series of names.

35:51.290 --> 35:57.759
and tested them out, and then tried to find the signatures of these people, because she was thinking, well, it might be a court secretary or something, which is very clever.

35:58.419 --> 36:20.689
And she found a signature, which she showed me the other day, that is basically identical in the sense that it has the C-H-E-T, the last couple letters, has all the pen flourishes, these very elaborate pen flourishes in the same way, little caddles, that this piece with the court official seems to have used routinely, and it practically matched what remained

36:20.990 --> 36:44.449
the signature in our book so she has identified if not the originals a very early owner of the book and if we made a facsimile of the book and she was working from it she might have come across that and still wondered but at the end of the day sometimes she's going to have to handle the real thing or if she was going through a like a hill monastic manuscript type of microfilm she never would have seen it

36:44.750 --> 36:46.052
I don't think.

36:46.072 --> 36:47.253
Well, that's for sure.

36:47.414 --> 36:48.335
That's for sure.

36:48.395 --> 36:49.196
Right.

36:49.216 --> 36:54.984
The one change that may be in the works that is a little bit different is digitization is a remarkable phenomenon.

36:55.004 --> 37:00.912
And digitization allows you to see a level of detail that people have not noticed before.

37:01.533 --> 37:08.062
And sometimes when I look at a digitized detail of one of our own manuscripts, I will see things that I didn't see from just down there staring at it.

37:08.222 --> 37:10.926
So I'm not opposed to sort of photography or digitization

37:11.243 --> 37:14.547
But usually at some point you need to actually go back to the manuscript and work with her.

37:14.567 --> 37:15.508
That's a great story.

37:15.788 --> 37:19.412
Do I have on the tape the name of that manuscript?

37:19.472 --> 37:22.176
It's called On the Lives of Illustrious Men and Women.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.379
It's a French translation of a Latin text by Boccaccio.

37:25.479 --> 37:26.500
Oh, Boccaccio.

37:27.622 --> 37:28.503
That's terrific.

37:28.523 --> 37:29.264
That's a terrific story.

37:29.284 --> 37:37.453
It's a wonderful manuscript, actually.

37:37.805 --> 37:45.373
Art museums are institutions that believe in the value of the original, of the aesthetic superiority of the original to the reproduction under all circumstances.

37:45.393 --> 37:50.878
So, you know, it's simply... Yeah, it's showing facsimile.

37:50.959 --> 37:55.403
In fact, we've had... I mean, you know, there are museums that do this, of course.

37:55.423 --> 37:56.845
Right, right, right.

37:56.865 --> 38:07.035
And in fact, you could... I think, actually, if we took facsimiles of our own manuscripts, which are of very high quality, and put them in the case next to a manuscript and lived them carefully,

38:07.403 --> 38:11.669
You'd still be able to tell the difference.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.812
Let me just say hi to Kate.

38:13.832 --> 38:19.139
I'm very sorry that we've missed your Armenian exhibition, which apparently... Ah!

38:20.180 --> 38:22.884
Oh, that's very interesting, don't you?

38:22.964 --> 38:30.354
Oh, you don't want to hear all of this.

38:30.374 --> 38:30.595
Thank you.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.517
The book on Armenian culture is really extraordinary.

38:32.537 --> 38:33.799
Probably, you know, it seems to be...

38:34.538 --> 38:39.084
I'm not an Espresso star, I'm an Armenian, although we've done a number of shows now on Armenian subjects over the years.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.549
And so I've learned a little bit about it through the curators that work on it.

38:42.569 --> 38:47.816
But it really seems like for Armenian culture, the book is really the great cultural artifact.

38:47.836 --> 39:00.934
And they are revered in a way, and panned it down from generation to generation in a way, with a kind of respect and veneration that even exceeds, and I think that's true of Western culture in general, which Armenian is a part of it.

39:01.538 --> 39:03.320
But it's special.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.762
It's something very different and special.

39:05.002 --> 39:11.090
And when you think of it, there are people who lost their homeland, and how did they preserve their culture and their history?

39:11.150 --> 39:11.691
Exactly.

39:11.711 --> 39:14.334
That makes the book that much more important as a vehicle.

39:14.454 --> 39:20.502
And one of the great things about books, as you know, is that they're often filled with really, really interesting descriptions and family documentation.

39:21.282 --> 39:21.563
Great.

39:23.345 --> 39:24.947
Why don't I start with one or two of them?

39:25.940 --> 39:30.307
If you go around, if you want to go in and get started, I'll come in and join you and help you.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.409
I'll be there just in a second.

39:31.449 --> 39:33.532
I'm rambling, sorry.

39:36.296 --> 39:38.760
Anyway, there is this kind of social veneration.

39:39.101 --> 39:44.229
We have in Los Angeles a very large and enthusiastic, very interesting and diverse Armenian community.

39:44.830 --> 39:52.622
We have another situation, again, because the Getty collection is so small, we have three or four manuscripts, most of the things we got from Ludwig,

39:53.294 --> 39:57.681
Armenian manuscripts that didn't always have an obvious context in which to show them.

39:57.721 --> 40:01.687
So we've thought of ways where there's a really serious community that cares passionately about their books.

40:02.809 --> 40:07.076
We have an obligation to occasionally do some kind of an exhibition that will be interesting for them.

40:08.478 --> 40:13.606
As it happens, UCLA also has a collection of Armenian manuscripts that they acquired 20 years ago.

40:13.626 --> 40:16.570
I don't know the story very well, but that's an interesting story.

40:17.592 --> 40:18.433
You might ask about that.

40:18.453 --> 40:21.478
It's a great story, the Armenian collection at UCLA.

40:22.758 --> 40:26.442
And they have one really great manuscript, which for many years has been disbound.

40:27.363 --> 40:40.577
And one of the things that we like to do is show manuscripts that are disbound, because if you want to talk about a manuscript as a work of art, and you put it in the case, you see an opening, you don't get to turn, you know, the visitor doesn't get to turn the pages.

40:40.998 --> 40:42.880
It's accessible, but only up to a point.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.863
If you have a book that's disbound, you can, in a sense,

40:46.231 --> 40:48.554
But by walking through the gallery, people are turning the pages.

40:48.775 --> 40:50.617
They're getting to see the pictures as well.

40:50.978 --> 40:53.902
And so to do, it's hard to find books that are disbound.

40:53.922 --> 41:04.959
But one of the things, when I hear about a major manuscript being disbound, I see that as a really great opportunity to teach the public about books and about manuscript illumination in ways they never can.

41:04.979 --> 41:06.501
Anyway, this book was disbound.

41:07.803 --> 41:14.112
The Armenians were internationally on the verge of celebrating the 1700th anniversary of the founding of the church.

41:14.632 --> 41:18.901
So we went to UCLA and said, you know, and the book actually needed some conservation work.

41:18.941 --> 41:32.809
We said, we will do the conservation work required in this book if you will allow us to show.
