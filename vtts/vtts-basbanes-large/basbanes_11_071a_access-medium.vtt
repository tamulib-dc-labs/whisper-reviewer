WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:07.073
put on the tape recorder, and we're talking to Joan Hedrick.

00:08.054 --> 00:27.479
And I'm interested in this whole process of, even with the tenor of your keynote address that you gave at that conference, you are at the forefront among scholars who are developing that canon of women writers.

00:27.499 --> 00:28.780
Is that a fair statement?

00:29.201 --> 00:30.122
Well, I suppose it is.

00:30.743 --> 00:59.029
fair to say that one is always developing a canon in one way or another a lot of us like to think that we're trying to get away from the whole notion of canon a certain body of books that is somehow consecrated and special and lifted up above the others but of course inevitably as people start thinking and reading and writing about a certain body of text conversations develop around them they become

00:59.279 --> 01:00.661
a canon in that way.

01:00.901 --> 01:09.233
And so I think that is fair to say that we are, even as we dispute the notion of a center and a canon.

01:09.753 --> 01:15.902
So your position then is that you don't like the idea of a canon, per se.

01:16.843 --> 01:29.100
You say... I am typically, like, liberal on this question, divided because the problem with the great books is that

01:29.637 --> 01:51.221
It rather artificially takes certain books out of their cultural context, makes them universal masterpieces, and by making them icons, I think it often makes access to them more difficult for students and for the general reader.

01:52.482 --> 01:54.464
Pardon me, but you mean intellectual access?

01:54.484 --> 01:54.804
Yeah.

01:55.786 --> 01:56.146
Yeah.

01:57.407 --> 01:58.969
Maybe you could explain that a little bit.

01:59.962 --> 02:05.647
Well, it's something that's a masterpiece.

02:05.827 --> 02:15.116
It, in some ways, becomes beyond certain kinds of criticism, I think, at various points.

02:19.020 --> 02:29.850
It also, inevitably, when you have a canon, it excludes other books that aren't in the canon.

02:30.202 --> 02:52.547
any any group of books that gets in there is selected by the people in the profession who have the most powerful voices and they have their own points of view and their own vision and those in one way or another attract them to the books that they choose so that their whole world views that get uh

02:52.966 --> 02:55.877
represented by those books and other worldviews that get excluded.

02:56.158 --> 03:00.654
So it's the exclusivity of a canon that I think is troubling.

03:01.457 --> 03:03.364
Of course, the other side of it is if you don't

03:03.766 --> 03:10.856
If there is no group of books that most people are reading and talking about, if everything is out there, then how can you have a conversation?

03:10.896 --> 03:12.018
Nobody's read the same book.

03:12.038 --> 03:29.984
So, I mean, I recognize the necessity of having such kinds of... Well, regrettably, I wasn't able to attend the conference, but certainly, judging from your remarks, there are any number of women who wrote in the 19th century who are totally forgotten, I mean, and who are ignored.

03:30.184 --> 03:32.187
And it seems to me that...

03:32.791 --> 03:37.479
Part of what you're trying to accomplish is to... To bring them back.

03:37.499 --> 03:37.880
To bring them back.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.022
To bring them into the canon.

03:39.202 --> 03:39.743
Absolutely.

03:39.823 --> 03:40.063
Yes.

03:40.464 --> 03:45.713
I mean, we're working with the structures we have, and that's... And how does the process work?

03:45.733 --> 03:46.775
How do you discover things?

03:46.815 --> 03:58.815
How do you determine that writers who are totally unknown to not only students, but to, you know, readers like myself, people who read books,

03:59.386 --> 04:07.701
How do you decide that work that was once ignored because all of a sudden... That's the $64,000 question.

04:07.901 --> 04:14.693
You know, in this group that sponsored the conference, the 19th Century Northeast American Women Writers Group, we go round and round with this question.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.658
Well, what kind of standards do we have?

04:17.738 --> 04:19.481
What is it that makes a book interesting?

04:19.722 --> 04:24.330
How do we talk about the aesthetic pleasure we have in reading a book?

04:24.597 --> 04:28.461
I mean, the basic kinds of literary critical questions are not very easy to answer.

04:28.762 --> 04:29.362
How do you know?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.267
What is it that makes you like a book?

04:35.049 --> 04:45.000
Because I think there are very deep kinds of connections that can get established between one's own experience and the experience of the writer.

04:48.143 --> 04:53.389
I don't know that we're always completely aware of exactly what it is that draws us to a writer.

04:53.842 --> 04:56.905
So the task of criticism, you know, is complex.

04:57.306 --> 05:05.334
The other issue is certain kinds of schools of critical thought are more applicable to certain kinds of literature than others.

05:05.615 --> 05:14.564
And so when a certain school of criticism is dominant, those works which are easily approached through that lens can become popular.

05:14.584 --> 05:17.207
I mean, the new criticism of the 20th century is a good example.

05:18.429 --> 05:21.672
Poetry became something that was...

05:22.377 --> 05:37.938
I think, moved to the forefront as a genre because it really responded well to that kind of set of critical questions about ambiguity and that sense of a literary work being very self-contained and you should be able to understand it just in its own terms.

05:39.220 --> 05:45.368
And other kinds of works, like the work of Theodore Dreiser, for example, how would you ever approach that in new critical terms?

05:45.949 --> 05:49.954
The works that were really engaging the issues of social realism and

05:50.660 --> 05:57.909
and certain kinds of economic issues, social justice issues, how do you approach those within the lens of new criticism?

05:57.969 --> 05:58.350
You can't.

05:58.390 --> 06:04.457
So those works tend to be not, then, in the canon when that school of criticism is dominant.

06:04.818 --> 06:15.151
Let's just take Stowe as your own... Now, for years, virtually all of our other work has been largely dismissed, right?

06:15.171 --> 06:15.992
That's right.

06:16.012 --> 06:18.675
Except for Uncle Tom's Cabin, and even then there are people who

06:19.111 --> 06:26.120
suggest that Uncle Tom's Cabin is more of a socially, culturally important book than it is a literary book.

06:26.140 --> 06:35.332
I mean, I know you dispute that, but let's just talk about Stowe as an example of how you have worked to actually look at the body of her work.

06:35.552 --> 06:40.579
I think this is a valid area that you're looking into.

06:41.116 --> 06:48.625
Well, it's a good example of the way in which, when fashions change... Let's hope it is closer so it doesn't pick up the... You want to push the people... Did you do my work?

06:48.725 --> 06:48.886
No.

06:49.366 --> 06:51.088
We've got construction going on.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.453
I have to describe these things.

06:54.513 --> 06:55.153
Yeah, I know.

07:01.581 --> 07:04.525
Well, where to begin on this one?

07:06.682 --> 07:10.346
Certainly in the 20th century, Stowe has been viewed as a sentimental writer.

07:10.606 --> 07:23.560
That is a word that has been used to marginalize the works of lots of the 19th century American women writers who were quite prominent in their time.

07:24.982 --> 07:35.473
It's a term which right now there's a lot of attention being paid by

07:36.618 --> 07:39.361
critics to really looking at what that means.

07:39.441 --> 07:46.870
Instead of just using it to dismiss a work, a lot of the women in the group that I belong to are really trying to say, well, what does it mean to be a sentimental work?

07:46.930 --> 07:48.732
What are the parameters of that?

07:48.812 --> 07:49.613
How does it work?

07:50.635 --> 08:06.253
So one movement is to really see this as a term like realism that is more or less neutral in the way that it resounds, and it's a descriptive rather than a pejorative

08:06.554 --> 08:13.565
If you can rehabilitate a term like that, you can also rehabilitate the writers who have been marginalized by the term.

08:15.427 --> 08:17.190
Explain how you use the word marginalized.

08:23.299 --> 08:31.752
Well, I guess it's just a shorthand way of describing the process that happened to somebody like Stowe, who was

08:32.626 --> 08:42.477
who was such a dominant cultural voice in the 19th century, had such influence, whether she was talking about matters in the American home or slavery.

08:43.479 --> 08:50.967
And then she fell out of favor and in the 20th century canon simply was not read very much.

08:51.528 --> 09:01.840
And so it's that sense of moving from a central cultural place where you have a voice to a place where people know you're there,

09:02.191 --> 09:09.758
people refer to you, but in this pejorative way that basically signals you don't need to read this woman's work.

09:10.338 --> 09:17.504
You know enough to know she wrote a sentimental book, and she rushed through her writing, and there it is, and some people don't engage it.

09:18.165 --> 09:26.252
So when you took on this project, obviously you quite strongly disagreed with that notion, that kind of a notion.

09:26.272 --> 09:26.492
Yeah.

09:26.512 --> 09:28.013
And what brought you to that?

09:28.033 --> 09:31.236
All right, all right.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.480
Actually, reading some of her work and reading her letters.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.402
Apart from Uncle Tom's Cabin.

09:37.422 --> 09:37.663
Yes.

09:38.223 --> 09:38.764
Yeah.

09:38.784 --> 09:39.906
Well, that was part of it.

09:39.946 --> 09:46.895
I don't think I had actually read Uncle Tom's Cabin until the late 70s, probably.

09:46.915 --> 09:49.999
I had never encountered it in graduate school or undergraduate.

09:50.359 --> 09:52.021
No, I'm an English major.

09:52.061 --> 09:54.064
I have a first edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

09:55.926 --> 09:56.848
I should have brought it down.

09:56.868 --> 09:57.368
I'm afraid.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.249
No, no, no, no.

09:58.269 --> 09:59.791
You don't put those things in your car.

10:00.032 --> 10:00.312
No.

10:00.578 --> 10:07.249
Yeah, I was an English major, and I was an American Studies major in my PhD work, and I never read it.

10:09.713 --> 10:24.477
What struck me was the wonderful immediacy and originality of her voice, and I was just stunned by that, because I had imagined that it was going to be treacly, that it was going to be

10:24.777 --> 10:26.240
wooden and predictable.

10:26.421 --> 10:37.707
I mean, my idea of sentimental is that there's a very formulaic kind of language and it doesn't have a freshness, and just the opposite of the way her voice, both in her novels and in her letters, struck me.

10:38.277 --> 10:42.221
You really feel that a live person is speaking right to you.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.965
And I thought to myself, I could spend some time with this woman.

10:45.985 --> 10:47.606
I don't think I'd get tired of her.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.629
And it proved to be true.

10:49.669 --> 10:52.191
Did she come to her serendipitously, or as a project?

10:52.812 --> 10:54.213
Well, it was a combination of things.

10:54.313 --> 10:57.717
I had done the book on Jack London and published that in 1982.

10:57.837 --> 10:59.358
I had just come to Trinity in 1980.

10:59.378 --> 11:03.863
I knew that her papers were just ten minutes from the campus.

11:04.484 --> 11:18.224
That was an important consideration, and I was working in the American Studies program here that was working hard to make connections with the city of Hartford, and I thought, well, this is a good way to make a local connection.

11:18.905 --> 11:27.538
And then I read a senior American Studies thesis on single women in Stowe's novels, and in the process of reading that,

11:28.430 --> 11:32.957
I had put before me these wonderful patches from her novels.

11:32.977 --> 11:34.639
I thought, this is wonderful, right?

11:34.699 --> 11:36.903
I had no idea, you know, all these riches.

11:36.943 --> 11:38.445
I wonder what's over in that archive.

11:38.766 --> 11:46.337
So I taught a summer course on 19th century domestic novels and sent my students over there to just do four.

11:46.357 --> 11:50.043
So they were talking literally within, you know, five minutes of where we sit, right?

11:50.063 --> 11:50.944
Yeah, five to ten minutes, yeah.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.222
and just told them, go see what Stowe wrote about domestic things in her letters.

11:55.262 --> 11:56.243
You know, just go see.

11:56.263 --> 11:58.205
And they brought back these wonderful pieces.

11:58.265 --> 12:00.207
I still remember this one letter.

12:00.227 --> 12:02.109
It was just delightful.

12:02.690 --> 12:17.325
Stowe elaborated her domestic difficulties, and then she concluded, so here I am, fighting the good fight against dust and disorganization and the downward tendency of all people and things, hoping for better times by and by.

12:19.187 --> 12:21.049
And it's that kind of...

12:22.784 --> 12:28.432
Ability to just concisely convey what she's going through that engaged me.

12:28.452 --> 12:35.102
Well, as you said, she certainly published a tremendous readership in her lifetime in a couple of times.

12:35.703 --> 12:39.548
That could be the greatest publishing story in the history of American letters, I would think.

12:39.588 --> 12:40.169
I think it is.

12:40.610 --> 12:43.294
And she published many other books.

12:43.414 --> 12:43.594
Yep.

12:43.979 --> 12:44.499
as well.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.240
And what happened?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.782
What happened to her reputation?

12:46.802 --> 12:54.669
I mean, did people tire of her, or was she rejected as being too sentimental or dated or whatever?

12:54.689 --> 12:55.790
It's a combination of things.

12:55.890 --> 13:12.366
I mean, the kind of Christian evangelical vision that informs Uncle Tom's Cabin and some of her other works was less appreciated when the culture became more secularized, when it became a much more

13:13.139 --> 13:19.946
pluralistic kind of culture in terms of Christianity, number one, wasn't the only religion that was contending, or Protestantism.

13:21.788 --> 13:43.129
So that's one issue, but to me the biggest issue is the one I talk about in the keynote, where the standards for judging literature really change, and male gatekeepers come in at the prestigious journals like The Nation and The Atlantic Monthly, and start talking about an aesthetic that could be summed up as art for art's sake,

13:44.020 --> 13:53.152
rather than the use of literature for cultural, social, political purposes, the way Stowe was clearly using it.

13:53.172 --> 13:56.696
I mean, women didn't have the vote at this time.

13:56.736 --> 14:00.661
The only way they could represent themselves was through literature.

14:01.522 --> 14:10.133
You could really influence the way not only people voted, but the way the whole culture moved if you could powerfully put your vision of the world out there.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.858
Stowe does it not only in Uncle Tom's Cabin, she does it in the minister's wooing,

14:14.193 --> 14:29.138
where she attacks Calvinism as a system and tries to really articulate a theology that to her is more congruent with her own experience as a woman and as a mother of a child who drowns.

14:29.819 --> 14:37.552
And she's expected to believe that he's damned in hell forever and she'll never, ever see him again, not even in the afterlife, forget about this life.

14:38.193 --> 14:40.757
And she basically, in a novel,

14:41.581 --> 14:44.144
does a profound work of theological criticism.

14:46.346 --> 14:48.628
Now, women weren't supposed to, you know, be theologians.

14:48.648 --> 14:50.650
They weren't supposed to be in the political sphere.

14:50.691 --> 14:59.219
But through the novel, she was using the only vehicle that was really readily accessible to women to pursue a whole variety of cultural ends.

14:59.580 --> 15:08.449
Had she been allowed, allowed, to write these theological treatises and these

15:09.560 --> 15:12.463
that you just discussed, do you think she would not have been a novelist?

15:12.483 --> 15:16.427
I mean, do you think she chose fiction because that was the only form available to her?

15:17.028 --> 15:19.911
Do you think she would have written essays in nonfiction and whatever?

15:19.931 --> 15:27.999
I think it's both... Yeah, I think she was strongly drawn to fiction because she had an imaginative visual kind of temperament.

15:29.321 --> 15:39.111
She was a teacher, and I think she... You can see, even when she has an opportunity to do a straight essay, she often...

15:39.428 --> 15:41.811
introduces fictional elements like dialogue.

15:41.851 --> 15:47.197
There's a very early letter to the editor she did to the Cincinnati Journal.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.300
She wrote it under a male pseudonym.

15:50.641 --> 15:56.588
She wrote it about these abolitionist riots where they were trying to keep an abolitionist publisher from publishing his paper.

15:59.571 --> 16:04.417
She could have done it any way she wanted because her brother was the temporary editor of the paper and it would have gotten published.

16:05.258 --> 16:09.182
But what she did was to write a dialogue between two men sitting at the dinner table.

16:09.736 --> 16:17.084
And I think she felt that fiction was a better way to get people in, to persuade them, than the straight essay was.

16:17.385 --> 16:20.008
This was a literary exercise for her then.

16:20.028 --> 16:20.869
It would seem.

16:20.889 --> 16:21.529
Yeah.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.173
What do you mean by that?

16:24.433 --> 16:26.936
An exercise of literary skill.

16:27.376 --> 16:27.937
Absolutely.

16:28.097 --> 16:28.838
Oh, absolutely.

16:29.338 --> 16:29.759
Story.

16:30.159 --> 16:31.321
We have talked about story.

16:31.341 --> 16:32.482
Story was important to her.

16:32.702 --> 16:33.643
Yes, it was.

16:33.723 --> 16:34.705
It was very important.

16:35.165 --> 16:39.490
And I think she linked it to the Bible, which is also...

16:39.655 --> 16:40.956
a book full of stories.

16:40.976 --> 16:56.654
I mean, she talks about that book as narratives, and I think she saw herself in Uncle Tom's cabin writing another kind of biblical narrative that had a kind of Christ figure in Uncle Tom.

16:56.814 --> 17:08.667
I mean, the critic Jane Tompkins has argued how she's really doing a kind of biblical typology here, but she viewed story as a good way of persuading people.

17:10.098 --> 17:21.894
And there's a wonderful statement she writes in a letter to the publisher of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Gamaliel Bailey, who is publishing this abolitionist journal where it first appeared.

17:22.395 --> 17:28.123
She said that, my job is simply to describe slavery in as graphic a fashion as I can.

17:28.644 --> 17:30.586
There is no arguing with pictures.

17:31.247 --> 17:34.051
People are persuaded by them whether they need to be or not.

17:34.091 --> 17:34.872
She says this?

17:34.892 --> 17:35.153
Yeah.

17:36.254 --> 17:37.736
Wow, what a person.

17:38.317 --> 17:38.417
Yeah.

17:38.887 --> 17:42.010
This is long before the age of imagery and visual stuff.

17:42.030 --> 17:42.931
I hadn't thought about that.

17:43.451 --> 17:43.752
You know?

17:44.012 --> 17:44.913
I hadn't thought about that.

17:45.213 --> 17:48.676
Her first desire was to be an artist, as her mother was.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.059
And she actually was a good amateur artist.

17:51.479 --> 17:54.602
So I think she did think very visually and very pictorially.

17:54.622 --> 17:56.724
I mean, I don't think 19th century writers did.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.728
I mean, certainly in terms of motion pictures.

18:00.768 --> 18:03.270
I interviewed Otto Bettman for this book.

18:03.290 --> 18:07.054
He was now 96 years old, who created the Bettman Archive.

18:07.642 --> 18:12.007
which has been acquired by Bill Gates and a little concordance and all that.

18:12.027 --> 18:16.732
And, of course, he was a former rare books librarian at Leipzig in 1933.

18:16.832 --> 18:18.674
Kept that forced him out and came here.

18:18.694 --> 18:22.398
But he talks about, you know, the power of books, but also the power of pictures.

18:22.458 --> 18:30.147
He basically invented this whole concept of visual imagery that you sell to Life magazine, and he created it.

18:30.167 --> 18:34.712
I mean, he basically, as a, you know, medium, as a tool of the medium.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.795
I mean, you say that she was talking about the power of pictures.

18:38.476 --> 18:41.479
That's a very late 20th-century, mid-20th-century statement.

18:41.519 --> 18:41.899
It really is.

18:42.019 --> 18:43.060
I hadn't thought about that.

18:43.160 --> 18:43.981
Yeah, yeah.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.122
Maybe along on that picture.

18:45.142 --> 18:47.024
No, but we are so visually oriented today.

18:47.064 --> 18:47.925
You're absolutely right.

18:48.085 --> 18:48.605
Yeah.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.746
It's amazing.

18:49.766 --> 18:53.349
And that's at a time when her culture was much more oral.

18:53.650 --> 18:57.933
You know, it was a time of the great speech and oratory.

18:58.874 --> 19:02.077
But she was really, you know, thinking in a different vein.

19:02.317 --> 19:04.159
So she is kind of at a different time in a way.

19:04.257 --> 19:33.842
Have you noticed, since the publication of this book, which everybody acknowledges is the, you know, as definitive as anything can get, nothing's ever definitive, I mean, you probably also agree that every generation needs a new biography of important people like Shakespeare or whomever, so nothing is ever the final word, but certainly, but with the publication of this book and the wonderful response that it's had, do you find a

19:34.379 --> 19:43.432
a change in attitude towards her reputation, the interest in her as a literary figure?

19:45.014 --> 19:46.016
It depends.

19:46.036 --> 19:48.419
You know, that was my initial sense.

19:51.583 --> 20:03.981
And certainly for the... I think there's no question that a major biography gives a huge lift

20:04.501 --> 20:11.067
to a literary figure because it provides the context and it focuses attention on them.

20:11.407 --> 20:12.848
And I know that it has done that.

20:15.431 --> 20:22.757
The book also came at a good time in terms of the development of feminist scholarship around women's literature.

20:22.797 --> 20:24.679
I mean, it wasn't right at the beginning of it.

20:24.699 --> 20:26.260
It's been going on for some time now.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.184
So there's all these people who came to the conference and hundreds of others who weren't there.

20:30.204 --> 20:32.466
You know, they're working in this field and it's important to them.

20:32.952 --> 20:40.965
But when you get outside the academy, I don't know that it's made a whole lot of difference, to tell you the truth.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.227
It's hard to gauge that.

20:42.828 --> 20:46.093
I do know it's being read with great appreciation by general readers.

20:46.173 --> 20:47.675
It's been picked up by a lot of book clubs.

20:47.856 --> 20:48.396
I hear that.

20:48.416 --> 20:52.363
The Library of America gave a volume to her, I think.

20:52.383 --> 20:53.004
Yes, they did.

20:53.204 --> 20:53.865
Yeah, they did.

20:53.885 --> 20:56.629
That was actually out before my biography.

20:57.190 --> 20:57.651
Yeah, it was.

20:57.671 --> 20:58.572
I'm sure it was.

20:58.613 --> 21:00.536
Actually, she was one of the earliest.

21:00.636 --> 21:00.816
Right.

21:01.538 --> 21:03.281
They were quite alert.

21:03.421 --> 21:09.790
I mean, I have all of the library in America, because I love them, but I think that was easily one of the first 10 or 12.

21:11.432 --> 21:12.654
Yes, it was quite early on.

21:12.674 --> 21:13.455
You had a woman.

21:13.575 --> 21:21.286
It was before, yeah, it was, because I remember I referred to it when I was writing a grant proposal for this book way back in 82 or 83.

21:21.306 --> 21:23.530
So, yeah, that was one of the early ones.

21:23.550 --> 21:29.318
Well, she has, I mean, I think it has to be said, she really is one of the American women writers who is

21:29.669 --> 21:30.931
in the canon at this point.

21:30.951 --> 21:32.653
I don't think there's a question about that.

21:32.673 --> 21:40.665
No, there's no question about it, but I just bring her up because she's obviously... How about Sarah Arne Jewett, for instance?

21:40.826 --> 21:45.473
There seems to be a resurgence of interest, and a tremendous resurgence of interest.

21:45.553 --> 21:50.540
Right, a lot of interest in her, and several new biographies of her have come out as well.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.143
But I mean, I think she's been beatified.

21:52.163 --> 21:57.110
She's not quite up to the point of saying it yet, but it's... That'll be accurate, yeah.

21:57.370 --> 21:58.512
It just seems to be...

21:58.778 --> 22:00.781
I know the booksellers who are very savvy.

22:00.801 --> 22:21.552
I mean, it is interesting, isn't it, that the smart ones come to conferences like yours, and they, I mean, the antiquarian booksellers, trying to determine who the next collectible, not collectible, but important authors are, and who therefore, I don't know if there's a relationship.

22:21.592 --> 22:23.955
I asked Daniel Aaron that once, and he said, you've got me.

22:24.015 --> 22:25.157
I mean, I had no idea, and

22:25.863 --> 22:27.786
They're quite irrelevant to me.

22:27.806 --> 22:33.833
He wants a good text to read from, whether it's the first edition or anything like that.

22:33.853 --> 22:45.088
But if we could talk about the whole concept of that conference, 19th century women in the 21st century, so you're jumping 100 years, why didn't you include 20th century women there?

22:45.549 --> 22:49.053
Why was it so important to really go back to that?

22:49.073 --> 22:50.415
Why wasn't it more inclusive?

22:51.737 --> 22:55.802
I think the idea of that title was, here we are on the cusp of the

22:56.002 --> 23:02.388
21st century, the 19th century is going to be two centuries back, not just one century back.

23:02.448 --> 23:06.812
How is that going to change, if at all, the way we view these writers?

23:08.033 --> 23:12.557
Is this not a good time to simply assess where we are in our writing and thinking about them?

23:12.638 --> 23:21.005
It wasn't really meant to exclude where we are right now, but just to try to gather up where we are right now and kind of toss it toward the future.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.927
There's a state of position, though.

23:22.947 --> 23:23.848
I mean, the fact that

23:24.672 --> 23:35.945
You are almost 200 years or two centuries behind, and this material is still pretty much out there, waiting to be, I guess, reclaimed.

23:37.126 --> 23:40.510
And maybe that's kind of the thing that you're suggesting as well.

23:40.931 --> 23:42.693
Now, what happens at a conference like this?

23:43.594 --> 23:48.199
Do people come in and offer takes on various writers?

23:48.888 --> 23:50.270
Yes, did you get a program?

23:50.610 --> 23:51.391
No, I'd love a program.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.552
Yes, take that with you.

23:52.833 --> 24:01.023
Yes, tons of papers given on all sorts of subjects.

24:01.043 --> 24:04.567
You'll see that it's really very wide-ranging and diverse.

24:05.368 --> 24:17.663
The program committee made the decision not to have any panels on single authors, which is one attempt to move away from that notion of the canon, but to try to see writers in relationship to one another and through topics that bring...

24:18.318 --> 24:22.763
So you quite deliberately stayed away from individual authors?

24:22.783 --> 24:23.604
Right.

24:23.784 --> 24:28.149
People were surprised there wasn't more on stove here, given the nature of the conference.

24:28.169 --> 24:31.093
But we really wanted to catch the net as broadly as we could.

24:31.113 --> 24:32.855
And so what was the result, in your view?

24:33.395 --> 24:34.717
Was it livelier?

24:34.737 --> 24:37.320
Oh, it was a fabulous conference.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.363
The energy level was just palpable.

24:40.383 --> 24:41.845
To me, it was like a...

24:42.095 --> 24:50.425
A good party, when you listen to the buzz of conversation in the first half hour, and you know, no matter if I spill champagne all over the rug, it's not going to matter.

24:50.465 --> 24:51.226
It's a great party.

24:51.286 --> 24:53.409
That's the way it felt, and it just went that way.

24:54.571 --> 24:58.836
Who do you think, could you recommend people that I should contact?

24:59.196 --> 25:00.498
You know, I was thinking, yeah.

25:00.558 --> 25:02.220
Maybe give me some ideas of where I should go with this.

25:02.300 --> 25:02.681
Sure.

25:02.741 --> 25:06.105
I'm just kind of hoping that I can read.

25:06.425 --> 25:07.927
I'm just trying to, you know, get into this.

25:08.148 --> 25:08.488
Sure.

25:08.828 --> 25:10.110
Enter this whole conversation.

25:11.677 --> 25:16.161
Yeah, I could, you know, the best thing would... You don't have to do it right now.

25:16.202 --> 25:16.462
Right.

25:16.822 --> 25:21.487
There's a list of books that the program committee suggested be on hand in the bookstore.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.869
I can ask my secretary to get that for you.

25:24.230 --> 25:28.294
In their view, you know, the state-of-the-art kinds of things people would be looking for.

25:28.914 --> 25:38.764
And I think you should probably talk to other members of the program committee who are the most thoughtful and articulate spokespeople and thinkers around the issues that you're...

25:39.402 --> 25:42.226
You're probing, and I'd be happy to give you their names and addresses.

25:43.368 --> 25:44.530
Here, I can make a copy for you.

25:46.272 --> 25:50.519
I mean, there's seven of them, six of them, really.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.021
I'm on here, but I'm not.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.543
You're already talking to me.

25:53.563 --> 25:55.566
But I'll make a list of... That'd be great, if you don't mind.

25:55.586 --> 25:56.267
Yeah, no, that's fine.

25:56.287 --> 26:00.213
And I'd like to talk to you again at some point, too, I think, when I'm... Sure.

26:00.734 --> 26:01.956
I'm at the very beginning here.

26:01.976 --> 26:02.076
Sure.

26:02.096 --> 26:02.737
No, I understand.

26:02.757 --> 26:03.819
You've got to go back and forth.

26:04.500 --> 26:04.600
Yeah.

26:05.592 --> 26:15.626
you know, naive and not particularly knowledgeable in this subject, but I think that as we get into it, is it a contentious kind of a thing?

26:15.666 --> 26:27.001
I mean, you mentioned the male gatekeepers who were, I mean, were they, you can't say maliciously, but they were mindfully excluding, you know, people from getting by and getting in.

26:27.021 --> 26:35.312
It can become very polemic and, what's the word, polemical and contentious, yes, when you get into this

26:36.237 --> 26:48.608
Well, the Jane Smiley letters in my keynote probably give you as much a clear sense of how contingent it can be when you dare to suggest that one writer who's a woman is better than writers of men.

26:48.628 --> 26:56.155
I don't think that's necessarily the best way to frame the issues, but it's a very charged political issue.

26:56.676 --> 26:58.458
What books should we teach?

26:59.078 --> 27:03.342
It's a very charged political issue, whether you're talking about a

27:03.659 --> 27:08.004
an elementary school curriculum in a town, or you're talking about college texts.

27:11.628 --> 27:21.099
These issues don't often come to a head in day-to-day teaching, because in a school like Trinity, professors simply teach what they want to teach.

27:21.279 --> 27:28.868
But when you approach this in a conference setting, and when you try to engage these issues, yes, they can become very contentious.

27:28.888 --> 27:33.413
But is this the ultimate issue, the books that do make it into the curriculum?

27:34.490 --> 27:48.804
The books that are taught are required or suggested, and those are, I mean, I personally have to say how shocked I was when Georgetown dropped the requirement that English majors have to take a course in Shakespeare.

27:48.864 --> 27:52.448
They are not required to study Shakespeare to get a degree in English.

27:53.328 --> 27:55.110
I mean, that bothers me.

27:55.591 --> 27:59.555
I don't know how you can study English literature and not study Shakespeare.

27:59.995 --> 28:04.159
And I wonder if, I mean, what brought that about?

28:04.848 --> 28:08.371
I'm not asking you to address yourself to that particular issue.

28:08.392 --> 28:10.454
Maybe you wouldn't want to talk about it, but whatever.

28:10.494 --> 28:12.456
That kind of thing does happen, doesn't it?

28:12.476 --> 28:13.256
Oh, absolutely.

28:13.336 --> 28:18.061
And it reflects a changing sense of what it means to be an educated person.

28:18.381 --> 28:23.847
You know, that is an ideal that changes historically over time.

28:24.808 --> 28:30.113
It used to be to be an educated person or an educated man, because this was a time before women were in the...

28:30.532 --> 28:35.217
You learned Latin and Greek and the classics, you know, the whole classically educated.

28:35.238 --> 28:48.473
And then, you know, the elective system came in, when was it, 1859, I think, and it was an attempt to articulate people with the emerging industrial economy.

28:48.493 --> 28:52.878
I mean, you know, the classical education just didn't cut it now.

28:53.239 --> 29:00.387
You know, with railroads and all this technology, you had to have engineering, you had to have, you know, a professional kind of training.

29:00.974 --> 29:02.536
That has to shift historically.

29:03.476 --> 29:16.970
And it's also probably important that there are groups that champion... I'm thinking of Harold Bloom's book from last year, where he identified the five groups that are threatening the Western canon.

29:17.070 --> 29:24.837
I think the feminist critics were one, and the multicultural were another, and I can't recall the other.

29:24.857 --> 29:29.462
I didn't read it, but I know... How do you respond to that kind of...?

29:29.965 --> 29:34.929
Circling the wagons mentality, in your view?

29:35.050 --> 29:43.637
Are the sides being... Oh, they have been for some time, been dividing up in this way.

29:46.060 --> 29:53.646
The men in the academy didn't have to defend their choices until women started coming in, until minorities started coming in in greater numbers.

29:53.706 --> 29:58.791
So they were able to teach without having their choices questioned.

29:59.513 --> 30:04.958
Now when a new group comes in, it looks like what they're doing is special interest.

30:05.379 --> 30:15.668
The fact that the older group also had their special interest but they weren't challenged dulls the edges of the politics of the already established.

30:15.729 --> 30:26.719
So I think that this is just the kind of thing that happens when groups with different worldviews, different interests, different

30:26.918 --> 30:30.642
senses of their own position in the world come together.

30:30.963 --> 30:35.328
They naturally, just the way they have different worldviews, they have a different sense of what books are important.

30:35.889 --> 30:39.713
And you would hope that you mention a school like Trinity, a liberal arts school.

30:41.055 --> 30:45.840
I mean, a kid should be able to study what the kid wants to study, I guess.

30:45.921 --> 30:55.592
I mean, you shouldn't be restricted to, you know, a very finely focused canon for quotation marks around it.

30:55.876 --> 31:00.120
that somebody has decided is what you should read to the exclusion of other things.

31:00.180 --> 31:01.682
I mean, that's just a statement.

31:01.702 --> 31:16.958
It's a question of any... I think that's a kind of educational philosophy that Trinity and a lot of liberal arts schools would endorse, that there ought to be a kind of wide-ranging sense of cultural literacy.

31:18.359 --> 31:23.745
But... And just the fact that Stoll wasn't taught when you went to... Where did you go to college, by the way?

31:24.105 --> 31:24.786
To Vassar.

31:24.884 --> 31:25.946
I went to Massa.

31:26.106 --> 31:27.829
Was it Brown for my graduate work?

31:28.269 --> 31:38.446
I went to Bates up in Maine, which had a very strong English department that I never encountered still there at all, except in our cultural context.

31:38.466 --> 31:42.091
Golly, and that's close to where she wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin, isn't it?

31:42.111 --> 31:43.414
Oh, it's in Lewiston's name.

31:43.474 --> 31:44.636
How far is that from Brunswick?

31:45.036 --> 31:46.278
Oh, it's about 18 miles.

31:46.498 --> 31:48.361
It's very close.

31:48.381 --> 31:49.804
Bowdoin is right down the street.

31:49.824 --> 31:50.605
Wow.

31:50.855 --> 31:53.918
It's shocking!

31:53.938 --> 31:54.098
Yeah.

31:54.158 --> 31:59.723
I've certainly read Hawthorne and all the others, but... Everybody was reading, yeah.

32:00.264 --> 32:02.946
Of course, the quote, you know, Lincoln, that this, are you the woman?

32:02.986 --> 32:03.587
Yeah.

32:03.947 --> 32:05.288
You know, it was hard to explore.

32:05.308 --> 32:13.055
I mean, of course, when you think of people, one of the pejorative descriptions of a person would be, he's an Uncle Tom.

32:14.477 --> 32:17.299
I think that almost is used to put down the novel.

32:17.399 --> 32:18.500
It is, yeah.

32:18.520 --> 32:18.640
Right.

32:18.660 --> 32:20.322
That's another whole...

32:22.242 --> 32:35.944
issue that I didn't touch on when you asked me how it happened that she fell out of favor, but the Tom plays, the putting of the novel on stage, happened almost as soon as the novel was published and continued well into the 20th century.

32:36.325 --> 32:40.972
That play ran continuously for 90 years or something like that.

32:41.914 --> 32:48.064
And in the 20th century, that was the strongest image many people had of the book.

32:48.331 --> 33:01.026
even though the plays themselves drew on the minstrel tradition, became more and more actually racist in their stereotypes and in their bloodhounds chasing the niggers and all that.

33:01.626 --> 33:05.711
And yet that's what many people thought Uncle Tom's Cabin was.

33:05.891 --> 33:12.079
So part of the Uncle Tom pejorative is coming out of that knowledge.

33:12.119 --> 33:16.684
You almost wonder, when you look at somebody just by contrast, like, I can't

33:17.069 --> 33:31.916
You're talking about something that's just as important.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.559
Context is everywhere.

33:37.117 --> 33:42.041
I'm sorry.

33:42.061 --> 33:46.465
That is a good conversation stopper.

33:46.485 --> 33:46.946
That's funny, isn't it?

33:46.966 --> 33:47.086
Yeah.

33:47.106 --> 33:52.771
An otherwise proper... Yeah, my Andy Warhol touch on it.

33:53.292 --> 33:59.877
You talk about, you know, somebody like Melville, who was basically forgotten in his lifetime.

33:59.938 --> 34:00.278
Yeah.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.921
And he just went the other way, didn't he?

34:03.961 --> 34:06.043
He was discovered in the 20th century.

34:06.344 --> 34:07.265
That's right.

34:07.886 --> 34:20.765
And now they, you know, he's regarded by many to have written a great, a great... And that's an instructive counter-example, because I think in academic circles, a popular writer can't be a good writer.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.349
And so this is the other side of the coin.

34:23.409 --> 34:28.136
Melville went and he quit writing Taipei and Oumu and the popular adventure tales.

34:28.156 --> 34:28.677
He vanished.

34:28.697 --> 34:29.298
He vanished.

34:29.738 --> 34:33.043
Oh, but now we find he's really deep and good.

34:34.660 --> 34:36.041
Oh, I hate that particular.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.523
I mean, I write about new books, too.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.684
I mean, I write a weekly column.

34:40.545 --> 34:45.970
And The Kiss of Death is for a literary writer to be popular.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.973
I mean, to talk to somebody like Pat Conward, who I really like.

34:50.053 --> 34:52.836
I mean, he writes, you like him or dislike him, it's irrelevant.

34:52.856 --> 34:59.722
But he's totally rejected because of the fact that so many people like his... I mean, I think that's a non-standard.

34:59.862 --> 35:00.803
Yeah.

35:00.823 --> 35:03.385
And I think Ann Tyler is almost, now they say,

35:03.837 --> 35:07.562
Because she's made a couple of bestseller lists, it's almost like she's commercial now.

35:08.203 --> 35:11.227
And I think she's the same man, Tyler, she's always been.

35:11.247 --> 35:11.407
Yeah.

35:12.609 --> 35:14.231
I mean, that always seems to apply, doesn't it?

35:14.251 --> 35:18.797
Well, it's a very elitist kind of standard, something that only the few can discern.

35:18.837 --> 35:21.440
That seems to be the definition of good art.

35:21.821 --> 35:26.847
But it's totally opposite of the kind of thing that Stowe was trying to do.

35:26.867 --> 35:31.954
I mean, if you're trying to influence a culture, if you're trying to persuade people, you want to reach as many people as possible.

35:32.407 --> 35:38.713
I've often thought of writing an essay, and I don't know how I do it, but I have all of Celia Thaxter's books, you know.

35:39.173 --> 35:39.954
Oh, really?

35:39.974 --> 35:41.455
I happen to love Celia Thaxter.

35:41.475 --> 35:41.695
Oh, wow.

35:42.076 --> 35:48.422
I get into it through the Hassam, you know, lithographs that he did for An Island Garden.

35:48.442 --> 35:52.565
You know, if you're familiar with that, well, that's a great, great book.

35:53.446 --> 36:02.194
It came out in 1894, just a few months before she died, and it's got 14 color lithographs by Childe Hassam, which makes it exceedingly rare.

36:02.697 --> 36:06.563
and beautiful, but probably the most beautiful 19th-century American book.

36:07.144 --> 36:09.327
Anyway, so I've gone and collected.

36:09.407 --> 36:10.148
I won't see you there.

36:10.188 --> 36:13.233
She was extraordinarily popular in her lifetime.

36:13.774 --> 36:14.315
She really was.

36:14.355 --> 36:16.298
I mean, she wrote for magazines.

36:16.338 --> 36:17.740
She lived in The Apple Show.

36:17.760 --> 36:22.146
And she's a contemporary of Emily Dickinson, and she actually, you know, wrote for The Atlantic.

36:22.166 --> 36:23.108
Yes, I was going to say that.

36:23.188 --> 36:24.790
I know about her, but I've not read one stick.

36:24.810 --> 36:29.177
And Neva Higginson, I think, was a, I mean, there were even points of contact where a

36:30.119 --> 36:32.222
You could almost say, why was Emily Dickinson?

36:32.262 --> 36:34.807
She couldn't even get a damn poem published.

36:34.827 --> 36:47.267
I mean, the two or three items that she had published were done anonymously, and yet Emily Dickinson speaks to us today so powerfully, and Siga is totally unknown.

36:47.467 --> 36:48.509
Do you think her work is good?

36:48.990 --> 36:49.691
Who, Siga?

36:49.751 --> 36:50.492
No, I don't.

36:50.753 --> 36:55.620
It's entertaining, it's amusing, and it's decidedly dated.

36:56.001 --> 36:56.582
Interesting.

36:56.832 --> 37:01.096
You know, she's kind of like a Longfellow in that respect.

37:01.996 --> 37:04.458
But that book, The Island Garden, is a classic.

37:04.478 --> 37:05.439
It's on poetry.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.223
She probably developed the first American garden strictly for beauty.

37:10.323 --> 37:11.344
I mean, it was all flowers.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.786
She raised vegetables or anything like that.

37:13.806 --> 37:17.730
And she was on this little island, Appledore Island, on the Isle of Shoals.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.252
And it's a gorgeous, gorgeous book.

37:21.353 --> 37:26.417
Yale had a huge exhibition around it, based on it five years or so ago.

37:27.072 --> 37:30.437
It has some paintings, and the book is so scarce.

37:31.799 --> 37:35.424
I'm sorry to go off on this tangent, but I mean, here are two names from the 19th century.

37:36.005 --> 37:38.529
She, again, was like Stowe.

37:39.270 --> 37:40.572
Everybody knew her work.

37:42.595 --> 37:43.717
Totally disappeared.

37:43.757 --> 37:46.461
Dickinson, you know, and how does Dickinson get?

37:47.302 --> 37:50.346
All of a sudden, I don't know.

37:50.587 --> 37:55.594
I have the first Dickinson poem poetry, too, which is a treasure.

37:58.072 --> 37:59.934
Dick Hughes on your program, wasn't she?

38:00.014 --> 38:02.437
Yeah, Celia Thaxter is getting more and more attention.

38:03.218 --> 38:06.222
She was definitely, I can't remember which sessions, but I know she was.

38:06.282 --> 38:08.324
Oh, she's starting to take off, actually.

38:08.344 --> 38:14.331
I mean, I've had some exceedingly good offers for the, I don't sell my books, so they're not, it's not an issue.

38:16.734 --> 38:21.460
But Priscilla Jovellis, I said, anything Thaxter, she can sell immediately.

38:22.261 --> 38:26.526
I mean, I have a book, an island garden, that I'm sure Celia signed.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.483
And she died six months after that book came out.

38:29.503 --> 38:31.386
There was only a thousand copies.

38:31.666 --> 38:31.846
Wow.

38:32.026 --> 38:38.755
With these wonderful lithographs by Hassam, which alone, I mean, there were people who raped these books and stripped them.

38:38.875 --> 38:39.416
Oh, dear.

38:39.436 --> 38:39.676
Yeah.

38:40.738 --> 38:44.563
And sell the lithos for like 150 bucks a piece, and there were 14 in there.

38:45.664 --> 38:57.019
Well, it's... Well, I think one of the reasons that people fall out of favor is that they don't have

38:57.421 --> 39:00.946
a network of friends and publishers who are keeping their name before the public.

39:01.266 --> 39:03.149
There's a wonderful essay I would recommend to you.

39:03.930 --> 39:05.452
It's by Jane Tompkins.

39:06.333 --> 39:14.705
It's called Masterpiece Theater, I think the subtitle is The Politics of Hawthorne's Literary Reputation.

39:14.745 --> 39:21.995
And it's in a book by Jane Tompkins called Sensational Designs, published by Oxford.

39:23.236 --> 39:23.417
What?

39:24.138 --> 39:25.099
I'll let you get that down.

39:25.349 --> 39:52.066
What she argues is that if you analyze Hawthorne's career, both during his lifetime when Fields was promoting him, and Fields really made him a kind of canonical writer by collecting his works, putting him out in uniform edition, puffing him all the time, and he really created Hawthorne the great writer.

39:52.667 --> 39:54.850
And then after Hawthorne died, he had

39:55.184 --> 39:58.308
friends from Bowdoin, publishers.

39:59.410 --> 40:09.945
He was a member of the Saturday Club, and through that network had all kinds of friends, again, in publishing, who continually kept his works in print, his name out there.

40:10.206 --> 40:12.829
Now what happens to a woman like Celia Saxter when she dies?

40:12.869 --> 40:14.131
Does she have a Saturday Club?

40:14.151 --> 40:17.837
Does she have people who are interested in keeping her name before the public?

40:17.877 --> 40:22.003
Or there's a kind of network of people who have the power to do this.

40:22.163 --> 40:22.403
No.

40:22.704 --> 40:25.107
So once you fall out of the canon,

40:25.087 --> 40:28.150
Out of the reading public's attention, how do you get back in?

40:28.450 --> 40:29.311
Actually, out of the circle.

40:29.411 --> 40:30.613
She has an interesting story.

40:30.853 --> 40:34.456
She had this little salon on the island, and everybody went there.

40:35.097 --> 40:38.821
The literati, the cognoscenti, the painters, they all went.

40:39.922 --> 40:42.264
And she was very well connected.

40:42.284 --> 40:43.185
She had a son.

40:43.245 --> 40:49.692
Her greatest fear in life was that she would die before she had a retired son.

40:50.132 --> 40:50.612
And she did.

40:51.914 --> 40:54.216
So she was really focused on him.

40:54.938 --> 41:02.587
But I think that this circle worked to keep her stuff viable while they were alive.

41:03.589 --> 41:07.533
But once that's, I mean, I think it just corroborates what you're saying right now.

41:07.874 --> 41:16.965
But once this little circle, very, very influential, this whole Boston cultural elite, you know, and I'm sure they're the reason that she was published at all.

41:17.906 --> 41:21.030
You know, and something like Dickinson, who had no clout, got nothing.

41:21.247 --> 41:24.770
I'm sure Emily would have loved to have been published in her lifetime.

41:24.790 --> 41:25.851
I mean, it would seem to be.

41:26.231 --> 41:26.712
Who knows?

41:27.472 --> 41:28.793
Maybe you feel differently.

41:29.014 --> 41:32.957
I don't know the story of that, whether she wanted to be published or not.

41:33.117 --> 41:37.001
I thought that she had a lot of reservations about that.

41:37.281 --> 41:37.701
Who knows?

41:37.721 --> 41:39.963
But, I mean, she did have a couple of poems out there.

41:40.003 --> 41:40.544
She did.

41:41.104 --> 41:42.685
Higginson put them out there.

41:42.705 --> 41:44.667
Higginson really put her down, too.

41:46.309 --> 41:46.969
Yeah.

41:46.989 --> 41:49.972
He's the one who basically, he was the gatekeeper in her case.

41:49.992 --> 41:50.292
That's true.

41:50.525 --> 41:53.749
And he was also the gatekeeper in Cecilia's case, I think.

41:53.889 --> 41:55.711
I mean, it's a very interesting story, isn't it?

41:56.312 --> 41:57.974
I don't know if I could develop it in some way.

41:57.994 --> 41:59.776
And they were almost exact contemporaries.

42:00.257 --> 42:05.763
They may even have died the same within a year, and they had this... That would make a nice little story, the two of them.

42:05.783 --> 42:06.865
I thought about it, yes.

42:06.925 --> 42:07.906
I like that, yeah.

42:08.446 --> 42:15.655
Just as a... I mean, there's a more popular kind of an essay, not something that would come to...

42:16.495 --> 42:18.837
deeply involved in the scholarship book.

42:18.857 --> 42:20.058
But it does dramatize the issues.

42:20.078 --> 42:24.362
Yeah, and I think it's, to me, it's always been very, because I enjoy seeing the facts.

42:24.382 --> 42:25.923
I have a great affection for her.

42:26.083 --> 42:27.625
I love her attitude.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.146
She's very far ahead of her.

42:29.186 --> 42:35.612
I just thought, this is her idea where flowers, you know, I mean, this garden was because she liked it.

42:35.632 --> 42:39.595
It wasn't, you know, because I have to raise vegetables and feed my family.

42:39.676 --> 42:41.697
And that was really one of the first gardens?

42:41.717 --> 42:45.861
It was, it is, this, her book is considered to be the first book

42:46.060 --> 42:52.930
in the United States printed about a garden that is strictly decorative, yeah, for, you know, beauty.

42:53.010 --> 42:54.592
It's called An Island Garden.

42:55.734 --> 43:01.963
And it's a great, great, I mean, I have written about that, and it fascinates me.

43:01.983 --> 43:04.847
And then the writing is nice, but again, it's the hassle.

43:05.488 --> 43:13.519
I was basically responsible for Nifflin reissuing that book about five or six or seven books, but maybe it's ten years, no time flies.

43:14.157 --> 43:16.079
And it's in print, you know.

43:16.099 --> 43:17.020
I think we did about ten.

43:17.040 --> 43:17.300
That's great.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.262
I mean, they did more in the reprint than it ever did.

43:19.282 --> 43:20.364
In its time.

43:20.384 --> 43:20.984
In its time.

43:21.044 --> 43:26.610
And it had a wonderful binding a woman, the foremost woman binder of her time.

43:26.630 --> 43:28.492
I can't think of her name right now.

43:28.512 --> 43:31.836
There's little poppies on that cloth, tutorial cloth.

43:31.856 --> 43:32.516
Wonderful.

43:32.536 --> 43:34.138
Gold embossed and green.

43:34.859 --> 43:35.740
Magnificent.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.541
And the designer.

43:36.921 --> 43:40.705
It was basically an all-woman project except, you know, for the Hassan

43:41.495 --> 43:44.558
That's a great, great, great point.

43:44.899 --> 43:46.240
Sorry to go off on that.

43:47.101 --> 43:47.982
Where are we going here?

43:48.963 --> 43:51.466
Sensational Designs, which is the book.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.007
Jane Teal, M-K-A-N-S?

43:53.968 --> 43:56.291
P-K-I-N-S.

43:56.311 --> 44:05.060
Next time I go into Widener, I'll grab it.

44:05.801 --> 44:09.865
Any advice on where I should go?

44:10.334 --> 44:13.358
In terms of talking about the conference?

44:13.378 --> 44:18.304
In the conference, just the general subject of people I should talk to.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.208
Just remind me what the large frame of the book is.

44:21.368 --> 44:32.442
The large frame is... I'm really interested in how, you know, women are working to establish, you know, a body of literature.

44:32.502 --> 44:34.785
How you rediscover things.

44:35.125 --> 44:36.467
How it enters the canon.

44:36.727 --> 44:38.029
How literary works.

44:39.595 --> 44:42.380
go from the total obscurity to being rediscovered.

44:43.041 --> 44:47.288
I'm interested, I guess, also in the, you know, the factions that have developed.

44:47.348 --> 44:51.835
I mean, you talk about the gatekeepers.

44:51.875 --> 44:53.037
That's a buzzword.

44:53.077 --> 44:54.039
I'm interested in that.

44:54.560 --> 45:06.379
I'm interested in finding about, you know, to see how politically charged the... Well, you know, an excellent person to talk to here would be Paul Water, who is also at Trinity.

45:07.355 --> 45:10.178
He did the Heath Anthology of American Literature.

45:10.778 --> 45:10.898
Okay.

45:11.659 --> 45:14.241
Are you familiar with what he tried to do there?

45:14.341 --> 45:14.602
No.

45:14.742 --> 45:34.560
He put together this seminar at Yale back in 1982, which became the hub of his editorial board, and basically wanted to figure out how you made an anthology that was a lot more inclusive than the anthologies of American literature of the past.

45:34.726 --> 45:45.529
said about recovering writers, and he's probably the foremost person in this country in terms of really thinking about this whole issue of recovery on a grand scale.

45:45.690 --> 45:48.195
Yeah, and he's very articulate.

45:48.547 --> 45:53.553
He was president of the American Studies Association this past year, so he's very nationally prominent as well.

45:54.615 --> 45:55.676
And what was the book?

45:55.696 --> 45:56.577
It was called The Heat?

45:56.937 --> 45:57.458
This is it.

45:57.658 --> 45:58.439
Oh, there it is.

45:58.459 --> 46:00.001
This is always the second volume of it.

46:00.562 --> 46:00.642
Wow.

46:00.982 --> 46:01.763
And who is Heat?

46:01.824 --> 46:04.667
I don't know who the Heat is.

46:04.687 --> 46:05.668
The publisher, Heat.

46:06.589 --> 46:09.693
They do a lot of... Let me just give you information, if I may.

46:09.733 --> 46:10.074
Go ahead.

46:10.094 --> 46:13.378
Oh, out of Lexington.

46:13.498 --> 46:15.060
Do you see Heat and Cafe?

46:16.762 --> 46:37.520
I mean, it's huge compared to, I mean, there's two volumes of this size, but what we did at this conference, I mean, if you just look at the, if you look at, here's the beginning, Literature of Discovery and Exploration.

46:37.540 --> 46:37.620
Wow.

46:37.640 --> 46:41.203
It's a different kind of, I mean, just look at the people included.

46:41.783 --> 46:46.127
What we did at the conference was really brainstorm, well, how do you have to change the categories?

46:46.512 --> 46:55.219
Because, you know, if you just think in terms of naturalism or the old literary labels, you don't include everybody.

46:58.182 --> 47:06.349
It looks like there's an excellent... To the readers, you know, it looks like there's a great introduction here.

47:08.571 --> 47:11.653
I suspect a good deal of what you're saying is articulated.

47:13.675 --> 47:14.876
Oh, this is great.

47:15.376 --> 47:16.097
I never heard of it.

47:17.191 --> 47:18.593
Yeah, this has gotten a lot of play.

47:18.613 --> 47:19.654
It's been very successful.

47:19.674 --> 47:23.559
This is the second edition you're looking at here because the first edition was very successful.

47:23.839 --> 47:33.551
They also put out a newsletter so the people who are using it and teaching it in classes can be in touch with one another about how they've used it or what strategies have been successful.

47:33.571 --> 47:39.939
So it's like a whole institution that has really... And how has it been accepted out there?

47:39.979 --> 47:41.461
Paul could probably tell you more about that.

47:41.501 --> 47:45.426
My sense is it's been quite successful.

47:45.693 --> 47:47.115
L-A-U-T-E-R.

47:47.135 --> 47:49.580
Yeah, he's in the English department, that building that you found.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.742
The one that I was in?

47:50.762 --> 47:51.423
Yes.

47:51.443 --> 47:52.905
Yes, he lives in New York.

47:52.966 --> 47:53.927
I can give you his numbers.

47:53.947 --> 47:57.193
Okay.

47:57.213 --> 47:58.635
I might wait until the school's back.

47:58.916 --> 48:01.140
Yeah, it'll be easier for you.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.462
I'm in New York all the time.

48:02.482 --> 48:03.163
Do you use email?

48:03.604 --> 48:03.804
I do.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.327
He's an email freak.

48:05.367 --> 48:07.350
I am getting that way, actually.

48:07.771 --> 48:08.933
Where's my directory?

48:10.853 --> 48:12.595
Oh, this is going to be very helpful.

48:12.615 --> 48:13.737
This is very good.

48:14.378 --> 48:25.952
Yeah, I would say Paul and the program committee are among the people I know in this country who are most involved in these issues of the canon and women's literature.

48:27.054 --> 48:31.139
Paul has been one of the few men involved in our group right from the beginning.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.582
He was part of the conference?

48:33.602 --> 48:39.730
Yeah, he was part of the conference, and also he's been part of this group, this 19th century American women writers group that got the idea to have the conference.

48:41.667 --> 48:49.659
Are you making any headway in publishing the... Yes, it's right over here, Dr. Potter.

48:49.779 --> 48:50.079
Oh, good.

48:51.241 --> 48:51.962
Excellent.

48:51.982 --> 48:52.243
Thank you.

48:54.045 --> 48:57.651
Dr. Kroll.

48:57.671 --> 49:00.174
While you're doing that, why don't I run a copy of this?

49:00.194 --> 49:02.057
Okay, if you don't mind, that'd be great.

49:02.097 --> 49:02.258
Thanks.

49:02.558 --> 49:05.582
Copy machine right in front of you.

49:05.602 --> 49:05.903
2303.

49:07.686 --> 49:08.687
Is the phone number?

49:38.603 --> 49:39.704
Yeah, that hurt a bit.
