WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.682
because I know who I am.

00:05.702 --> 00:06.463
You can just say your name.

00:06.523 --> 00:12.049
But first, I have to excuse my bad English, and maybe you could help me.

00:12.069 --> 00:14.231
If you could just say your name.

00:14.251 --> 00:23.081
Yes, my name is Uwe Hargelin, and I've been working with books since the early 1960s.

00:24.603 --> 00:30.409
I was interested in books and was a small collector even before that date, and I

00:30.642 --> 00:38.571
was mostly collecting art, graphic art and Japanese woodcut prints and so on at that time.

00:41.033 --> 00:53.387
But I met a very good friend who was older than me who was collecting Japanese illustrated books and also Japanese woodblock prints in about 1960, 61.

00:54.968 --> 00:58.472
And that perhaps started my career as a collector

01:00.055 --> 01:15.357
So I collected both graphic and Japanese woodblock prints, and also illustrated books, and also avant-garde books, Dada, and so on at that time.

01:17.700 --> 01:26.673
Back in 1963, I think, I started as an employee at Rennell's Antiquariat.

01:26.693 --> 01:29.978
It was the biggest

01:30.346 --> 01:56.623
in quantity the antiquarian bookshop here in Sweden where I would say in whole Scandinavia and it was also called the Stockholm catacombs because many people they couldn't find their way out when they had gone down in the cellar and it was a fascinating place I don't know if you Lars

01:56.840 --> 02:26.239
went there as a customer but not as an employee and in fact I remember one night and I wasn't there but we closed at 6 o'clock and about in midnight Mr. Rennell himself got a telephone call at 4 in the night and it was from a customer who had found his way up the

02:26.641 --> 02:31.987
the stairs to the first floor and have a telephone.

02:32.127 --> 02:32.768
Got locked in.

02:33.209 --> 02:35.011
And he wanted to get out.

02:39.416 --> 02:44.061
Well, I was working there for about, yes, the whole 60s, I would say.

02:45.163 --> 02:54.133
And more and more I was interested in the old books, and especially in science and natural history and medicine.

02:54.451 --> 02:59.157
It was also me who took care then of the old book collection at Rennell's.

02:59.597 --> 03:09.149
And also started with plates and maps and decorated prints and so on.

03:09.169 --> 03:22.926
And then this very traditional place closed and moved some hundred meters up the street to a modern establishment.

03:23.467 --> 03:23.867
Yes.

03:24.556 --> 03:31.345
And at that time, we had our first child.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.487
The first one, I'm sorry?

03:32.747 --> 03:32.988
Yes.

03:33.188 --> 03:37.314
Me and my wife had our first child.

03:37.394 --> 03:39.877
I was in 1969.

03:40.077 --> 03:44.563
And I stopped working at that time and took care of him.

03:44.744 --> 03:50.091
And my wife was working at the SAS, the Scandinavian Airline System.

03:50.375 --> 03:55.240
And we have free tickets all over the world at that time.

03:55.981 --> 04:01.666
And so we start also to go to foreign continents.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.988
It was in Los Angeles, for instance.

04:04.569 --> 04:11.516
And we met Jake Zeitlin and Ewe Dawson and John Howell and all of them.

04:11.556 --> 04:12.377
You met the great ones.

04:12.437 --> 04:15.620
I miss Haskell Norman and all of them.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.863
But it was only California, I would say.

04:19.180 --> 04:23.366
And then I was searching also for Japanese books.

04:23.386 --> 04:28.293
So I was in 1966 in Japan, in Kyoto.

04:29.535 --> 04:33.080
And then I found a lot of books for my own private collection.

04:35.323 --> 04:39.329
But at the same time, I started with my first catalogue.

04:39.590 --> 04:43.956
It was a very mediocre catalogue, but it was in many medical books in it.

04:45.742 --> 04:52.710
And since that, I have produced about 24 catalogs, I think.

04:52.730 --> 05:03.061
But in the middle of the 1980s, I was invited by the librarian for the Swedish Society of Medicine.

05:04.142 --> 05:10.569
And I heard that they had very good holdings of old books, but none had seen them.

05:11.671 --> 05:14.854
So I went there, and it was the 9th of October,

05:15.205 --> 05:15.626
1986.

05:15.706 --> 05:20.053
And that was about 2 p.m.

05:20.814 --> 05:24.139
And we started with something to eat.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.646
And I was surprised because they had no books in the library.

05:28.666 --> 05:31.250
It was only modern medical periodicals.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.476
And they told me that the books were stored in the cellar.

05:36.919 --> 05:37.820
And we went down.

05:38.361 --> 05:42.968
And the light wasn't on, so they had to go to

05:43.808 --> 05:45.470
had a thick lamp.

05:47.112 --> 05:50.896
There's a flash lamp to find something wrong there.

05:51.677 --> 05:55.861
And meanwhile, they were away from me.

05:56.042 --> 06:02.188
I took out one volume from some shelves that was marked Ischelenia.

06:04.191 --> 06:07.554
And it was a rather thick volume in half vellum.

06:07.755 --> 06:10.778
It was an early 17th century volume.

06:11.500 --> 06:18.126
And I found about 30 medical treatises in it, mostly dissertations.

06:18.666 --> 06:27.734
And I started from the end, you know, so, and found alchemical tracts, extremely rare things.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.436
Now, what kind of tracts?

06:29.596 --> 06:30.076
Alchemy.

06:30.096 --> 06:30.817
Alchemy.

06:30.937 --> 06:31.638
Alchemy.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.539
Alchemy.

06:33.199 --> 06:36.182
Alchemy, yes.

06:36.202 --> 06:40.866
And then it was handled about the discovery of the thoracic duct,

06:41.251 --> 06:46.056
and the lymphatic system.

06:46.677 --> 06:56.888
And I found Professor Thomas Bartholin, you know, the very famous professor of medicine and anatomy at Copenhagen.

06:56.908 --> 07:02.154
I found the first edition of all his papers on that discovery.

07:03.516 --> 07:10.043
And you know, we have also here in Sweden, Olo Frudbeck, who discovered the lymphatic system at the same time, or even before.

07:10.867 --> 07:19.822
But he published a bit later, about one month later, which gave rise to a very polemic discussion back.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.765
All these discoveries were made in one night?

07:22.506 --> 07:23.448
You made all of these?

07:23.488 --> 07:26.292
Yes, yes, yes.

07:26.573 --> 07:32.723
And when I counted in my head, I was valued at about...

07:33.108 --> 07:38.613
500,000 when I had come to... Half of the volume crowns, right?

07:38.633 --> 07:39.174
500,000 crowns.

07:39.194 --> 07:41.035
500,000 crowns.

07:41.756 --> 07:43.377
That's not insignificant.

07:43.398 --> 07:51.625
Yes, and then I went on, and it was handled about the circulation of the blood.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.207
William Harvey.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.608
Yes, you can understand.

07:54.948 --> 07:57.711
And it was many papers against Harvey.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.355
And I found, for instance, primrose excitationes,

08:03.010 --> 08:09.800
one of the harshest attack for Harvey, against Harvey.

08:10.581 --> 08:14.967
And I think it's known in only five or ten copies.

08:16.149 --> 08:21.116
And then when they come back, I would put back the volume in the shadow.

08:21.136 --> 08:25.862
And I only took a quick sight on the first page.

08:25.882 --> 08:32.832
And then I recognized the very famous titled page of Harvey's Demoticordis.

08:33.807 --> 08:35.169
And it was fully complete.

08:37.112 --> 08:41.779
And then I... Did these people know what we were doing?

08:42.921 --> 08:43.882
No, they knew.

08:44.002 --> 08:48.609
Most librarians in Sweden, they knew very little about their old collections.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.553
And you were there mainly to tell them what they had?

08:51.653 --> 08:52.294
Yes, yes.

08:52.335 --> 08:53.977
Then came the curious thing.

08:54.217 --> 08:57.402
I told them that it was a very important book.

08:58.613 --> 09:08.483
But they didn't understand that, and I had to explain who Harvey was, but nothing happened.

09:08.584 --> 09:27.844
Then I had to explain that I knew another copy, which was not complete, and it was without other papers bound separately, which had sold at Christie's some years earlier, for I think 100,

09:28.077 --> 09:54.878
20,000 pounds and then they they were interested so I was invited to go through the whole collection in the cellar and it was about one kilometer it was about let's say 80,000 volumes

09:55.448 --> 10:09.081
And then I picked out 500 volumes of that class, not in the economic sense, but 500 books, which I mean was a ground for a medical historical rare book collection.

10:10.062 --> 10:24.595
And I asked them, why shouldn't I also tell all the members in the Swedish Society of Medicine, there are about 20,000 of them, that they have a library and that there are also many, many fine and interesting and important books in it.

10:25.486 --> 10:35.518
And at that time there were some also female physicians who had became members of the board.

10:37.540 --> 10:46.431
And after that meeting they said that it was not so interesting because there were no female authors among those.

10:46.664 --> 11:01.422
And then I... So next meeting I have made a quite different... What do you call it?

11:01.622 --> 11:02.243
Suggestion.

11:02.363 --> 11:02.964
Proposed, yes.

11:03.525 --> 11:04.306
I made two books.

11:05.027 --> 11:12.756
One very important medical books in the Library of the Swedish Society of Medicine and one book called The Woman's Book.

11:13.208 --> 11:17.953
And it was taken by acclamation.

11:18.353 --> 11:18.893
That's right.

11:19.154 --> 11:23.198
And I made two books.

11:24.839 --> 11:33.868
And when those were published, they were very... Kindly met outside Sweden, in England, in the United States.

11:33.888 --> 11:34.949
Was this a catalog with you?

11:34.969 --> 11:38.692
Yes, it's a richly illustrated and annotated catalog.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.456
I can show you the books later.

11:42.908 --> 11:47.613
And this was just about 10 years ago, 1986?

11:47.793 --> 11:53.118
Yes, the first book was published, I think, in 87, 88.

11:53.799 --> 11:56.681
But had these books just been there?

11:56.942 --> 11:59.004
They had never been touched by it.

11:59.024 --> 11:59.784
I was the first.

11:59.864 --> 12:02.287
But how long had they been there?

12:02.307 --> 12:07.272
I was like the princess to life.

12:07.912 --> 12:10.074
So I get your names right when you speak.

12:10.174 --> 12:11.135
Do you want me to just write your name?

12:11.155 --> 12:12.797
Yes, I can give you my capital.

12:12.997 --> 12:20.108
And then the Karolinska Institute, which is well-known for you, I think.

12:21.070 --> 12:25.337
They decide about the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology.

12:26.659 --> 12:29.984
They had an even greater library.

12:30.685 --> 12:33.430
It's about two and a half kilometres of old books.

12:35.633 --> 12:40.641
So I made also another catalogue of them, and then I proposed that

12:41.026 --> 12:54.026
I thought it would be very good to assemble all those rarities under one roof where they should be taken care of in a better way than earlier.

12:54.587 --> 13:03.120
And also a library, or I mean more a museum, a book museum than a library.

13:04.562 --> 13:05.143
And then...

13:06.389 --> 13:11.655
Since that, I've also made two other catalogues for two other medical libraries in Stockholm.

13:11.675 --> 13:24.949
It's for the old Society for Gymnastics in Sweden, which is the first of its kind in the whole world, and also for the Swedish Pharmaceutical Society.

13:25.950 --> 13:33.358
And now we have assembled those books under one roof, and this year I also was made

13:33.608 --> 13:56.612
medical doctor honoris causa for my work with those old books and then since about only some weeks ago i've got free hands to be to build up this and i started who who acquired the books in the first place all books have been donated there are gifts everything no book is a

13:56.795 --> 13:58.858
purchased by the library.

13:59.198 --> 14:05.046
It's only gifts and donations from physicians, and very distinguished physicians in Sweden.

14:05.747 --> 14:13.517
We have, for instance, books from Linné's library and from Rosenstein's library, from every of those.

14:14.038 --> 14:16.421
And this goes back how long?

14:17.002 --> 14:22.549
Yes, the Karolinska Institute, you know, they started in 1810 about.

14:23.356 --> 14:32.148
But then they had to take over all the books in the library of the Collegium Medicum, which started all there in 1668.

14:34.912 --> 14:36.514
But they had no books at that time.

14:37.155 --> 14:46.427
But in the, I would say, in the 1740s and 50s, they got great collections from switch physicians who had been abroad.

14:46.846 --> 14:50.850
You see, in Sweden we couldn't take the doctor's diploma in Sweden.

14:50.910 --> 14:57.757
We had to go up to, mostly to the Netherlands.

14:58.618 --> 14:59.479
For the medical doctor?

14:59.619 --> 15:01.301
Yes, for the medical, yes.

15:02.242 --> 15:03.804
Especially to Leiden.

15:05.786 --> 15:11.652
And those trips, many physicians bought some books, of course, to come to Sweden.

15:12.533 --> 15:16.397
And both back in the nails, they took their diploma.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.158
in Holland.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.044
And all Swedish decisions before 1740, about.

15:24.084 --> 15:35.975
So I think the first donation was by Johan von Hoorn, who is called the father of Swedish obstetrics.

15:35.995 --> 15:40.840
And he gave some books already in the end of the 17th century to the College of America.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.123
How old is this society?

15:44.913 --> 15:47.055
How many hundreds of years?

15:47.215 --> 15:49.137
I can't give you an example.

15:49.177 --> 15:49.798
The 1660s.

15:50.018 --> 15:50.979
About the 1660s.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.582
So they've been gathering books for 300 years.

15:54.023 --> 15:58.227
But the old one that they haven't read before in the North London.

15:58.247 --> 15:59.849
And they didn't have a clue as to what they had.

15:59.889 --> 16:01.430
No, never.

16:01.450 --> 16:05.995
But you see... I'm the first one.

16:06.015 --> 16:07.076
Were they well taken care of?

16:07.116 --> 16:08.458
I'm the first one.

16:08.478 --> 16:09.339
You're the first one.

16:09.579 --> 16:10.600
Now you have the years.

16:10.698 --> 16:10.998
Yes.

16:11.259 --> 16:27.498
In the end of the 18th century, there were some people who collected books for professors, medical professors who collected books for their pupils.

16:28.199 --> 16:28.940
That's a great story.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.184
And one of them was Anders Johan Hagströmer.

16:32.444 --> 16:34.587
I can show you a picture of him later.

16:35.588 --> 16:39.473
He collected about several thousands of books.

16:40.111 --> 16:41.552
which he had at his home.

16:42.353 --> 16:45.797
And his home was the library for the medical students.

16:45.817 --> 16:53.564
And he also was head of the surgical society in Sweden.

16:54.886 --> 16:58.670
And he also was the first surgeon who became professor in anatomy.

16:59.450 --> 17:05.937
And he also became the first, what you call it, chief of the Karinska Institute.

17:06.758 --> 17:10.101
And he then was a very old man.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.440
But he took care of all those books.

17:13.241 --> 17:21.432
And he moved them from the old town, if you have seen it here in Stockholm, over to another part of town.

17:21.672 --> 17:24.436
It's only about 200 meters over the sea.

17:25.918 --> 17:33.227
And that was the first place for the Karinska Institute.

17:33.307 --> 17:34.449
Can I ask a tough question?

17:34.529 --> 17:34.729
Yes.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.291
What happened?

17:36.710 --> 17:38.833
How is it they didn't know what they had?

17:38.913 --> 17:40.596
Wasn't anybody interested in the book?

17:40.756 --> 17:43.040
It's out-of-date literature.

17:44.202 --> 17:54.137
That's the reason.

17:54.237 --> 18:03.932
I think the problem is that today's librarians, at least in Sweden, they...

18:04.621 --> 18:19.000
don't can... ...skilja... ...skilja mellan gamla böcker... ...difference by... ...by... ...literature and books.

18:19.941 --> 18:21.683
That is two quite different things.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.229
I'm only interested in the books, the physical book.

18:26.249 --> 18:28.652
I'm not interested in what it is in it.

18:28.672 --> 18:33.278
The literature and the author is mostly when you talk about three or four hundred old books.

18:33.798 --> 18:43.013
The less interesting thing, it could be the binding, it could be the provenance, it could be the printer, where it is printed, when, everything.

18:43.514 --> 18:46.679
The 3M papers and everything.

18:48.281 --> 18:49.844
And its place in history, of course.

18:50.885 --> 18:52.608
Like in museum objects.

18:52.628 --> 18:56.334
So this does not mean that there is an indifference to books.

18:57.196 --> 18:59.940
It's just an indifference to books that

19:00.157 --> 19:02.299
are not relevant to what they're doing.

19:02.319 --> 19:03.400
They're obsolete.

19:03.861 --> 19:09.246
They only keep in the... So there is no antiquarian spirit, so to speak.

19:11.549 --> 19:15.913
Or maybe some of them... Of course I'm interested in what the text is about.

19:16.994 --> 19:20.357
That you can see in my commentaries to the books.

19:20.377 --> 19:25.843
But if you don't save all this treasure,

19:26.279 --> 19:30.303
They have nothing to research in the future.

19:31.625 --> 19:37.671
When they asked you to come in, was it with the intention of selling the material or just telling them what they had?

19:37.691 --> 19:38.031
No, no.

19:38.312 --> 19:40.914
Yes, it was to tell them what they had.

19:40.974 --> 19:42.756
Why did they suddenly wish to know?

19:44.178 --> 19:45.299
Yes, it was something.

19:45.659 --> 19:46.800
They get a fine book.

19:46.841 --> 19:49.483
They could gather in a present to visitors.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.125
The Nobel Prize wins, of course.

19:51.205 --> 19:54.008
They all get my books.

19:54.376 --> 19:55.938
because it was something to give away.

19:56.278 --> 20:01.425
And they have a lot of visitors at the Carolinas Institute, for instance, of course, from abroad.

20:02.446 --> 20:05.289
So these books have not been catalogued then, right?

20:05.830 --> 20:10.336
Yes, they had a card with the author and title and so on.

20:10.977 --> 20:11.998
And there's a card catalogued?

20:12.018 --> 20:16.623
Yes, but I had no idea about any value or if it was old.

20:16.744 --> 20:21.109
If it was from the 16th century, it was an out-of-date literature.

20:21.713 --> 20:22.854
Can they have a library?

20:22.874 --> 20:26.798
And I can tell you that it was three more libraries, medical libraries in Stockholm.

20:26.818 --> 20:31.103
It was at the Garnifons, the military hospital.

20:31.904 --> 20:39.172
It was in the Serafimel Lazaret.

20:39.192 --> 20:40.213
It was the oldest one.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.655
The great collections, I think.

20:43.657 --> 20:49.883
And it was also the barn, the childbirth house.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.585
And it was grounded by

20:52.038 --> 21:00.472
Schultz von Schultzenheim, who went over in the 1740s to London to study vaccination or varioliation.

21:01.653 --> 21:06.782
But he happened to learn from Smelly the art of obstetrics instead.

21:07.222 --> 21:10.247
And he came home and was the greatest obstetrician in Sweden.

21:11.069 --> 21:17.539
And he was one of the greatest book collectors during the 18th century in medical books.

21:18.802 --> 21:26.555
And in the 1960s and 70s, those old institutions, those three I have mentioned here, was closed down.

21:27.716 --> 21:32.524
And all the libraries went to containers and was burnt.

21:33.967 --> 21:45.906
And especially at the childbirth hospital, it was even worse because, you see, we have a tradition here in Sweden to have a very fine fire.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.819
In the end of April.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.405
The last day in April, we had a great fire.

21:52.465 --> 21:54.007
Every year.

21:54.027 --> 21:55.990
When did you find those books?

21:56.431 --> 21:56.671
When?

21:57.553 --> 22:00.677
In the beginning of 1970s, I think.

22:01.178 --> 22:10.252
And they took out all the old books, the out-of-date books printed before 1800 and had a fire for them.

22:10.492 --> 22:14.779
Yes, but they saved some absolute...

22:15.451 --> 22:18.073
Invalued books.

22:18.094 --> 22:20.776
Invalued books from the 17th century.

22:23.358 --> 22:35.930
And also some books have already been... Get to the containers also in Swedish Society of Medicine and the Karinska Institute.

22:36.211 --> 22:38.333
But very few, very few.

22:38.993 --> 22:39.494
Very few.

22:39.934 --> 22:45.019
And in the Karinska Institute Library I found some extremely fine things.

22:45.758 --> 22:58.192
especially those things which the Swedish took as a war boat in the Emperor Rudolf II's treasure chamber in Prague in 1648.

22:59.354 --> 23:12.269
And I think I have one of the finest books, printed books, in that collection now at the Haakströme Library, which we call this librarian building up now, after that man I told him about.

23:12.289 --> 23:14.331
Now this library you're building up is...

23:15.053 --> 23:19.318
It's in the same, it's on the Karinska Institute campus.

23:20.219 --> 23:33.494
And I moved in in the old... Yes, of the Nobel Committee for Medicine and Physiology.

23:34.535 --> 23:41.483
It's not a very good place, but we start there, we will see.

23:42.391 --> 23:46.676
This house would be much better.

23:50.401 --> 23:50.761
Thank you.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.947
Please identify yourself.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.530
And also write your name down here.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.673
I will give you my card.

24:02.156 --> 24:07.943
Yes, my name is Mats Renström and I'm an antiquarian book dealer.

24:08.345 --> 24:29.046
Antiquarian book deal is specializing in old Swedish books and manuscripts and autographs and in reference books, bibliography and literature of history and history of literature and history of ideas.

24:30.567 --> 24:31.608
How old are you, might I ask?

24:32.069 --> 24:33.390
I'm 31.

24:33.691 --> 24:37.486
I'm curious how a young man gets into it.

24:37.506 --> 24:44.595
Yes, I began as a collector at

24:45.115 --> 24:51.803
I was 11 or 12 when I began visiting antiquarian bookshops.

24:51.863 --> 24:57.129
He was one of the most clever on old books in Sweden, even when he was 15 years old.

24:57.189 --> 24:58.431
No, no, not at 15.

25:02.395 --> 25:09.604
And I've always...

25:09.871 --> 25:11.833
Professionally, I began 1986.

25:12.153 --> 25:15.056
You were 21?

25:15.076 --> 25:15.256
20.

25:15.277 --> 25:16.157
20.

25:16.318 --> 25:16.578
Yes.

25:17.679 --> 25:24.286
And started my own business in 1991 here in Stockholm.

25:24.306 --> 25:29.891
And... Now, if you don't mind, I interrupt every now and then.

25:29.911 --> 25:33.035
Yes, please ask.

25:33.235 --> 25:35.157
Is there a clientele in Sweden?

25:35.177 --> 25:36.178
Are there collectors here?

25:36.438 --> 25:39.321
Yes, there are.

25:40.482 --> 25:50.057
I'm specializing to help building up collections and find books for collectors.

25:50.377 --> 25:58.910
Yes, both for private collectors and for libraries and other institutions.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.793
Inside and outside Sweden?

26:01.013 --> 26:02.676
Yes, that's right.

26:03.196 --> 26:11.027
I have some of my fine institutional clients outside Sweden.

26:11.968 --> 26:21.041
They are collecting Swedish books, old Swedish books and reference material.

26:21.521 --> 26:24.305
And also your connection to this place, can you tell?

26:24.525 --> 26:33.017
Yes, we have had connections since 1991 when I started and I have helped Lars

26:33.352 --> 26:36.096
building up the reference library, for example.

26:36.456 --> 26:38.059
Maybe you could both answer this.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.203
How considerable is your stock, your general stock?

26:41.223 --> 26:42.285
Do you have a good set?

26:43.326 --> 26:46.731
I don't know the size of it.

26:46.751 --> 26:49.635
It could be 5,000 or 10,000 books.

26:50.296 --> 26:54.522
And my own reference library is 10,000 or 15,000 books.

26:54.622 --> 26:56.044
So you reference, and yours?

26:56.064 --> 26:59.929
Yes, a tremendous one.

26:59.949 --> 27:03.274
I have a reference library about 150 years.

27:03.524 --> 27:06.187
I think it's 250.

27:06.207 --> 27:10.211
I don't know how many there are.

27:10.631 --> 27:13.194
But I also sold out a lot of it.

27:14.495 --> 27:22.463
But about Mads, I would say that about Swedish old imprints.

27:24.225 --> 27:28.329
He is the greatest ever in Sweden.

27:29.030 --> 27:29.430
Yes.

27:29.630 --> 27:33.535
Swedish imprints.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.618
So where do you find them?

27:37.500 --> 27:48.474
I buy books at auctions from colleagues and whole or part of libraries, private.

27:48.795 --> 27:58.287
Describe for me what Swedish... This sounds like a stupid question, I know, but just tell me Swedish imprints, what they comprised.

27:58.672 --> 28:27.582
kinds of things yeah yes there are all kind of books of course the first printed books is from 1483 but you find items like that no no no books from the 15th century at all out at the market more than leaves from them but but 16th century books you find

28:27.865 --> 28:31.011
But you have stopped at 1850?

28:31.312 --> 28:32.354
Yes, something like that.

28:33.436 --> 28:34.337
Not exactly.

28:35.159 --> 28:37.283
Earlier in 1850.

28:37.964 --> 28:41.110
And one other area like books, bond books.

28:41.130 --> 28:41.671
Yes.

28:41.692 --> 28:44.777
And bibliographies and so on.

28:45.078 --> 28:45.579
Yes.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.266
Have you ever sold a book from the 15th century?

28:50.107 --> 29:02.644
Swedish ones, not only leaves of Swedish books, but of course I have some incanabulas, but not Swedish, not from other countries.

29:03.606 --> 29:08.713
Swedish incanabula you can't find in complete books.

29:09.033 --> 29:11.416
Yes, one, very afraid.

29:12.197 --> 29:14.140
At that time, maybe even today.

29:15.520 --> 29:23.130
The Swedish 16th and 17th century imprints are extremely rare.

29:23.611 --> 29:26.715
They were printed in small editions.

29:26.775 --> 29:38.090
There were not so many books in Sweden at that time, and the books were really read and handled.

29:38.951 --> 29:42.996
For a long time.

29:43.195 --> 29:46.340
They are extremely rare.

29:46.380 --> 29:52.811
16th century Italian books is not an especially rare thing.

29:52.851 --> 29:57.920
We read to death and we read in cats.

29:58.100 --> 30:02.067
A very interesting thing is the Reformation in Sweden.

30:02.267 --> 30:05.573
They destroyed all books, I would say, they could find.

30:05.954 --> 30:08.578
And especially the old manuscripts.

30:09.402 --> 30:23.199
So in Swedish art keeps, we have the greatest collection in the world in the number of titles, I think, of old books.

30:23.219 --> 30:25.221
In Sweden we have what now?

30:25.482 --> 30:34.213
The greatest number of old manuscripts before the age of printing.

30:34.293 --> 30:37.857
But they're only fragments which they have found in their...

30:38.208 --> 30:39.890
covers of old books.

30:40.391 --> 30:41.773
They have used them as covers.

30:41.933 --> 30:44.637
I have some examples.

30:45.318 --> 30:47.642
They made the cardboard.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.404
I know what that means from old books.

30:49.605 --> 30:50.746
From old manuscripts.

30:50.867 --> 30:56.014
I just saw up at Mainz the other day at the Gutenberg Museum they have a

30:56.737 --> 31:01.782
It's a leaf that precedes the 42-line Bible.

31:02.783 --> 31:06.788
And it was probably the same, that's how they found it.

31:06.868 --> 31:08.570
It was used in the writing of the book.

31:08.670 --> 31:12.013
And most of the old books in Sweden, they have found in that way.

31:12.794 --> 31:19.241
I told you about this Klemming, the National Library, which we saw in the portrayal of the National Library.

31:19.301 --> 31:23.165
It was doing that, just that.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.068
Say it now at the table, when your chance comes, a big

31:26.268 --> 31:27.729
I'd like to have that on tape, okay?

31:27.749 --> 31:28.610
That's cool.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.292
Yes, Clemming was really fantastic.

31:30.512 --> 31:31.413
Do you know more about him?

31:31.433 --> 31:31.754
Yes.

31:31.834 --> 31:32.474
Well, tell me about him.

31:32.494 --> 31:32.775
Yes.

31:32.835 --> 31:33.816
Give me his full name, too.

31:34.016 --> 31:35.177
Yeah, Gustav Edvard.

31:35.778 --> 31:36.538
I can write it down.

31:37.079 --> 31:37.820
Okay.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.483
I mean, where two is, where the number two is.

31:41.503 --> 31:44.727
That's you, you're two, you're one, two, three.

31:44.747 --> 31:50.432
Yes, now you think I'm Gustav Edvard Clemming, and that's not very right.

31:50.472 --> 31:52.174
Here's another Clemming.

31:52.373 --> 31:58.981
In fact, he looks like it.

31:59.261 --> 32:09.313
If you tell an anecdote, it is that the old Clemming, he was very conscious about the Royal Library.

32:09.793 --> 32:18.043
He was wearing a large coat with big pockets.

32:18.243 --> 32:27.416
When he was visiting friends or private collectors, they always were, what do you call it, taking around him when they were saying goodbye.

32:28.037 --> 32:33.465
Because they wanted to feel if he were carrying away something to the Royal Library.

32:33.806 --> 32:34.707
From their collections.

32:35.749 --> 32:41.377
And that is, so therefore he built it up in different ways.

32:41.617 --> 32:43.219
And that is a change from that.

32:43.239 --> 32:47.085
Gustav Elvar Klemming was

32:47.335 --> 32:58.772
of a wealthy family and began as a private collector in the 1830s.

32:59.433 --> 33:13.655
And his brother started an antiquarian book business in the 40s, Clemmings Antiquariat.

33:13.675 --> 33:15.958
And the second brother was a well-known photographer.

33:16.141 --> 33:18.743
Yes.

33:19.524 --> 33:25.710
And Clemming began working at the Royal Library in the 40s, 1840s.

33:25.730 --> 33:27.772
He was at the Royal Palace.

33:28.172 --> 33:32.196
Yes, when he was still in Baranot's library.

33:33.477 --> 33:44.747
And he donated all of his own collections to the Royal Library.

33:45.065 --> 33:55.598
and began to systematically collect Swedish books from all times.

33:55.713 --> 34:04.926
As Niklas has told you, he found these leaves of the oldest printed Swedish books.

34:05.427 --> 34:11.555
They found them in the covers for archives.

34:11.635 --> 34:13.498
Yes, for example.

34:13.778 --> 34:23.492
And he also was traveling around in Sweden to the churches and in Finland also found leaves.

34:23.843 --> 34:27.548
So was he doing a systematic search for leafs?

34:27.568 --> 34:28.630
Yes, for leafs.

34:28.770 --> 34:29.872
In the bindings of books?

34:29.892 --> 34:33.717
Yes, and in the bindings of archives, the documents.

34:33.757 --> 34:35.560
So now it becomes very interesting to me.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.404
Yes, he is a really interesting person.

34:41.148 --> 34:46.115
But his interest wasn't only in the oldest books.

34:46.135 --> 34:50.982
He was interested in all Swedish printed books.

34:51.400 --> 35:06.152
So he also bought huge lawn, bibliothek, circulating libraries from the beginning of the 19th century to get

35:06.335 --> 35:15.993
to get the novels that have not been saved by his, what is it?

35:16.113 --> 35:19.379
Can I say something?

35:19.459 --> 35:26.352
It's rather curious because in Sweden we have a law from about 1660

35:26.669 --> 35:28.771
that every book should be preserved.

35:29.112 --> 35:29.692
1661.

35:29.852 --> 35:32.335
Well, I've heard it differently.

35:32.555 --> 35:35.939
Every book should be sent to the royal palace, not necessarily preserved.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.102
They want to see if it's something, you know.

35:38.122 --> 35:38.622
Yes.

35:38.642 --> 35:40.184
Yeah, that's also, it's a censor.

35:40.204 --> 35:40.704
Yes.

35:40.764 --> 35:44.208
It also should be preserved, but it needs to work.

35:44.308 --> 35:51.276
No, the librarians at the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, they thought that

35:51.475 --> 35:59.563
Another ABC book and another novel of no interest.

35:59.663 --> 36:03.988
So they had pretty regular book drawings?

36:04.748 --> 36:06.770
I don't know how they get back.

36:06.790 --> 36:11.335
Probably they gave it to the children and their wives.

36:11.555 --> 36:17.701
A lot of war voters had come to Stockholm from the 30 years war.

36:17.982 --> 36:19.503
And it came to the royal castle.

36:19.523 --> 36:21.465
It was the old castle, three crowns.

36:21.935 --> 36:25.078
It was in the same place as the nowadays castle, if you have been there.

36:25.739 --> 36:30.224
But it was... And that one was burnt down in 1697.

36:30.865 --> 36:34.949
And I would say that most of the books were... Two-thirds, yes.

36:35.049 --> 36:36.451
It was destroyed, yes.

36:38.072 --> 36:41.776
But the problem... But that wasn't deliberate.

36:41.796 --> 36:46.341
That was... It was a fire.

36:46.542 --> 36:51.587
And all other books, which they do take care of from the war bookies,

36:52.023 --> 36:56.609
They were sorted out by the librarian of Queen Kristina.

36:57.290 --> 37:01.996
And they were sent to different places to Lund in the south of Sweden.

37:02.016 --> 37:03.177
To Åbo, Finland?

37:03.278 --> 37:08.504
But especially to Finland, to Åbo University, because they had no books at all.

37:09.486 --> 37:18.197
And Gustavus Adolfus, he wanted them to have a library also to Åbo.

37:18.217 --> 37:21.321
So many books were sent to Åbo.

37:21.470 --> 37:35.523
Those books from the Swedish war builders who came to Obo, they were all burnt in 1877.

37:35.623 --> 37:38.550
Of course, the whole town was burnt out.

37:39.188 --> 38:05.685
so no books at all is left from there not by librarians this time no no librarians as we know we don't go downtown only books at that time it wasn't the librarians but was claiming he was systematically building up a a swedish collection a national collection of books

38:06.138 --> 38:24.231
and he was really successful he was the founder of the swedish national library scientifically he was the first yeah he collated the books for example that was he's the founder of the national library in sweden yes but he was selling books like

38:24.211 --> 38:41.882
He actually included some of the original leaves in his videography.

38:42.419 --> 38:47.768
I think it was good also because it was really duplicates.

38:47.828 --> 38:51.455
And he sent out this bibliography.

38:51.475 --> 38:59.328
He has been really criticised, mostly in the 20th century, mostly from a librarian point of view.

38:59.369 --> 39:04.798
But I think...

39:04.778 --> 39:22.146
all of the questions he was also human because he had two families but he avoided them so he more in the end of his life he lived in the library

39:22.615 --> 39:26.059
because it was too troublesome to join the family.

39:26.139 --> 39:27.341
There are many children too.

39:27.361 --> 39:30.064
Yes, I was four, but in one family.

39:31.265 --> 39:33.508
But he has two families.

39:34.830 --> 39:45.703
In one side he was a big man in what he was doing, but he also had a sort of social life.

39:46.392 --> 39:52.324
There is a photograph in the Royal Library.

39:55.250 --> 40:07.675
Is there anything written about him, do you think?

40:07.655 --> 40:10.761
Was he passionate about books?

40:10.901 --> 40:11.302
Absolutely.

40:11.382 --> 40:13.766
Yes, really.

40:14.327 --> 40:17.052
Mostly he was really a collector.

40:18.474 --> 40:21.039
I think he was the best collector ever in Sweden.

40:21.059 --> 40:27.250
But when his portraiture will find that you can't... He's...

40:27.533 --> 40:28.474
Your incarnation.

40:32.499 --> 40:39.768
We were walking by and you said, we paused, and you said, you know, take a look at that picture, that painting.

40:39.869 --> 40:41.070
Which was good.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.091
Which was quite nice.

40:42.212 --> 40:45.876
You haven't already seen it?

40:45.896 --> 40:51.623
We had a very like National Museum.

40:52.404 --> 40:55.228
He was showing us around and we went past the

40:55.765 --> 40:56.886
portraying.

40:56.966 --> 41:07.899
I had a very interesting day yesterday to the Nobel Library and then in the morning and then to the National Library in the afternoon.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.361
Bang, bang, bang.

41:09.642 --> 41:13.086
I heard from Lars that you shall leave tomorrow or tomorrow.

41:13.166 --> 41:25.080
Because if I had known this before, I could have shown you the library, the medical library, which I think is one of the only libraries which can be shown every book.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.972
in a very special way.

41:27.593 --> 41:31.117
But tomorrow, it's... It's closed.

41:31.137 --> 41:33.739
So it's an alarm, what you know.

41:33.759 --> 41:34.800
An alarm alarm.

41:34.820 --> 41:37.043
On Sunday, it's called alarm?

41:37.363 --> 41:38.484
Yes, alarm is on.

41:38.504 --> 41:39.886
I know exactly what you're saying.

41:40.426 --> 41:41.688
If we go in, the police will come.

41:42.068 --> 41:45.251
Yes.

41:45.271 --> 41:53.700
So who primarily do you deal with, private collectors or institutions?

41:53.883 --> 42:06.624
I tried to fill up the local vacances in the royal library that Clemming left, for example, trying to find the books.

42:07.345 --> 42:09.549
So, say that again.

42:09.669 --> 42:11.352
What do you try to do?

42:11.602 --> 42:17.689
complete the collections, the Swedish collections, for example, in the Royal Library.

42:18.109 --> 42:20.492
Is this a mission on your part?

42:20.532 --> 42:21.973
Yes, I think it's a mission for me.

42:21.993 --> 42:30.383
Especially there are a lot of Swedish books printed in the United States, you know, in the end of the last century.

42:31.063 --> 42:35.388
Because it was a lot of immigrants who published in Swedish.

42:35.548 --> 42:37.170
And those books don't have

42:37.437 --> 42:40.501
They have a lot of them, but they have a lot of them.

42:41.021 --> 42:42.563
They don't have them.

42:43.044 --> 42:43.585
Yes, they are.

42:43.625 --> 42:47.329
They seem to try to fill in books that were lost.

42:50.193 --> 43:03.068
Some of the printers at countryside in Sweden were not sending their books as they should have done to the Royal Library.

43:03.629 --> 43:06.853
So clearly you must have...

43:07.087 --> 43:09.169
What you must do is check the national catalog.

43:09.249 --> 43:09.509
Yes.

43:10.270 --> 43:14.574
And you acquire books, you see books, you check it.

43:14.694 --> 43:15.315
I acquire books.

43:15.395 --> 43:16.636
A passionate dealer.

43:18.318 --> 43:21.781
Working for the national library.

43:22.161 --> 43:24.183
Uppsala University Library also.

43:24.323 --> 43:24.603
Really?

43:24.684 --> 43:27.406
And have you found a lot for them?

43:27.426 --> 43:27.686
Yes.

43:27.907 --> 43:30.929
I have found a lot of books.

43:30.949 --> 43:35.794
You would love to have the old part of the catalog on the internet as well.

43:36.061 --> 43:42.148
Yes, but it's not so troublesome.

43:42.728 --> 43:59.746
A lot of the books are... Today you have a part of national bibliography on... Not on internet, but you can get... Telnet.

43:59.766 --> 44:01.208
Telnet, yes.

44:01.929 --> 44:05.933
What has been your most exciting discovery, would you say?

44:06.098 --> 44:15.006
Have you had any really exciting... Yes, I have had a lot of exciting... Have you had any... At night... Yes.

44:17.208 --> 44:36.105
An American... From an American point of view, I had extremely interesting... I found... I was in the attic on a big castle in Southern Sweden, Trollholm.

44:36.389 --> 44:41.997
going through their archives.

44:42.878 --> 44:55.636
And especially a part with unsorted items.

44:55.776 --> 45:04.388
And there I found a letter on 11 pages, I think it was, from Erik Björk.

45:04.908 --> 45:10.577
He dated 1711 in Pennsylvania.

45:11.779 --> 45:24.840
He was the Swedish minister of the Swedish church in Delaware.

45:25.377 --> 45:30.344
We had, for a short time, Sweden had a small colony in Delaware.

45:30.725 --> 45:31.586
New Sweden.

45:31.606 --> 45:32.267
New Sweden, yes.

45:32.848 --> 45:40.099
You know, in Worcester, Massachusetts, which is where I worked, there was a huge Swedish population, one of the largest in the country.

45:40.119 --> 45:47.029
But this we lost already in the 70th century to the Netherlands.

45:48.110 --> 45:49.292
The ordinary colonies.

45:50.133 --> 45:53.518
One time we owned a part of your country.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.022
Nowadays you own ours.

45:57.084 --> 45:58.566
No, no, I have two bubbles.

46:01.631 --> 46:12.228
I found an 11 pages long letter from Pennsylvania in 1711 or 1713.

46:12.348 --> 46:13.710
Maybe they had a car in it.

46:13.690 --> 46:33.595
Yes, and the letter, in the letter he was pledging for Swedish books for the church, for his church, and he has a long list of the books that has arrived, that has already arrived from Sweden to America.

46:34.256 --> 46:38.721
And this letter is now in the Morris Library at Delaware University.

46:38.742 --> 46:40.744
And this was really very early.

46:40.893 --> 46:41.574
Yes, it was.

46:41.594 --> 46:47.802
Because I write about in my book James Logan, who came to Pennsylvania in 1699.

46:47.943 --> 46:51.628
He was William Penn's assistant.

46:52.168 --> 46:53.390
Of course, he was brilliant.

46:53.450 --> 46:54.592
He was a genius.

46:55.653 --> 46:58.317
And of course, there were no books over there.

46:58.377 --> 47:00.119
So I write about how he got books.

47:00.460 --> 47:04.285
This is kind of... This was already in the 1640s.

47:04.585 --> 47:04.745
1630s.

47:04.765 --> 47:06.608
1630s.

47:06.908 --> 47:09.772
And where were they in the 1630s?

47:09.812 --> 47:10.854
Tell about it.

47:10.874 --> 47:15.280
Because 1620 is when the first settlement landed in Massachusetts.

47:15.300 --> 47:18.625
Yes, so we were in Massachusetts.

47:18.705 --> 47:19.906
There's a celebration here.

47:20.207 --> 47:24.653
If you could note that Sweden was the greatest country

47:25.173 --> 47:30.463
in Europe, all we done.

47:31.245 --> 47:36.555
During Gustavus Adolf, and also two other kings, up to Charles XII.

47:36.956 --> 47:39.521
It was the greatest country in the whole Europe.

47:40.763 --> 47:41.865
Yeah.

47:42.487 --> 47:44.009
Great military power.

47:44.209 --> 47:45.130
How about culturally?

47:45.651 --> 47:45.991
Yes.

47:46.432 --> 47:50.497
As I said, military power, not culturally.

47:50.517 --> 47:58.707
But we had Descartes on a short visit before he died here in Stockholm.

47:58.767 --> 47:59.769
Yes.

47:59.809 --> 48:00.750
We killed him.

48:01.711 --> 48:03.794
I think it's the greatest.

48:03.994 --> 48:06.017
He came to teach Christine.

48:06.317 --> 48:10.102
She wanted him to get up early every morning and get pneumonia and he died.

48:10.142 --> 48:12.004
Five o'clock in the morning.

48:12.254 --> 48:25.772
He invented some coordinate system for mathematics inside an oven down in Bavaria.

48:26.093 --> 48:31.360
And then he came to, because he was thinking very well in heat.

48:31.525 --> 48:32.767
Yeah.

48:33.068 --> 48:34.149
And then it came to Sweden.

48:35.111 --> 48:35.632
In code.

48:36.173 --> 48:38.276
Yes, and you can imagine directly.

48:38.296 --> 48:42.383
If I may say, should we go around to the table?

48:42.423 --> 48:44.887
Maybe we could go back again to different questions.

48:44.907 --> 48:47.091
And say your name so we have it in the same.

48:47.111 --> 48:48.994
Yes, my name is Lars Forsberg.

48:49.134 --> 48:51.238
And you're going to have to either write it down for me.

48:51.278 --> 48:52.881
Yes, I'll give you some.

48:52.981 --> 48:53.702
Okay, great.

48:54.087 --> 48:58.111
I actually read your book six months ago.

48:58.251 --> 49:00.393
I borrowed Uwe's copy.

49:00.473 --> 49:09.342
I'll tell you a cute story when you're done about it.

49:09.902 --> 49:13.286
Before I start, I could say something about his book.

49:13.726 --> 49:19.652
Because... ...about Steve Blomberg's collection.

49:20.212 --> 49:22.795
And that was so fascinating for me.

49:23.095 --> 49:26.298
And I would like to write something about Steve Blomberg.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.860
And I had your article in my answer.

49:28.880 --> 49:29.641
I'll help you.

49:29.661 --> 49:37.647
And we also, I think, Lars, have you already ordered the... No, but I have called the Peterson Court Report.

49:37.988 --> 49:38.408
Yes.

49:38.428 --> 49:39.749
It's expensive.

49:39.769 --> 49:47.896
Yes, because if you write it well, it could be some critics also for the Swedish libraries.

49:48.336 --> 49:50.238
I have all the stuff.

49:50.318 --> 49:52.680
But because Stephen Blomberg...

49:52.829 --> 49:55.593
He saved the books from the libraries.

49:56.154 --> 49:57.175
Well, that's what he said.

49:57.255 --> 50:01.321
Yes, that is part of it.

50:01.581 --> 50:03.364
You know what I mean.

50:04.105 --> 50:06.388
That was his defence of the trial.

50:06.508 --> 50:07.469
Yes, yes.

50:07.529 --> 50:10.914
You can see what I mean.

50:11.014 --> 50:12.756
It's a good picture.

50:13.137 --> 50:14.899
You can see.

50:15.340 --> 50:17.503
Overthold me.

50:17.483 --> 50:28.198
But if you write it very well, you can have some... I can't spell it in English.

50:28.218 --> 50:30.221
I have feeling for the man.

50:30.321 --> 50:30.982
We'll talk about it.

50:31.002 --> 50:31.583
But okay.

50:31.823 --> 50:40.636
I was very fascinated by this haven or more that you wrote on.

50:40.656 --> 50:45.162
Yes, and when my book is...

50:45.547 --> 51:01.245
When the new book is published in 1999, I hope, if I'm done, my publisher will issue a new edition of my book in a paperback, at which point I hope to bring you all up to date on Haven of War.

51:01.265 --> 51:02.427
That's very interesting.

51:02.447 --> 51:05.030
And I do have the rest of the story on him.

51:05.310 --> 51:12.178
I wrote an article on Sotheby's 150th anniversary.

51:12.462 --> 51:16.166
And then I came up with this, you know, well, The Garden Limited catalogue.

51:16.186 --> 51:21.873
And I read this Hemantle Moore's, what to say, essay on... And what was your reaction when you saw that?

51:22.233 --> 51:26.458
I think it was a very, very strange guy, because... You can be stronger than that.

51:28.380 --> 51:33.005
Well, he was, yeah, I don't know what to say in English, but he was very... Crazy?

51:33.025 --> 51:35.047
Yeah, well, absurd in a way.

51:35.388 --> 51:35.508
Queer.

51:35.708 --> 51:36.109
Queer.

51:36.669 --> 51:37.590
Yes, queer, yes.

51:37.750 --> 51:39.212
Because it didn't...

51:39.800 --> 51:43.487
First I read his own epilogue, his foreword.

51:43.547 --> 51:45.311
Which was impenetrable.

51:45.331 --> 51:46.654
Yes, what do you call it?

51:47.014 --> 51:47.816
Impenetrable.

51:49.780 --> 51:51.483
Yes, exactly.

51:51.503 --> 51:57.555
Where he put himself in a long tradition back to the 11th century or something.

51:57.575 --> 52:01.403
And then his epilogue...

52:01.822 --> 52:02.183
He is.

52:02.403 --> 52:03.525
Okay, I can imagine that.

52:03.866 --> 52:07.974
This guy built up one of the greatest collections in the garden.

52:08.055 --> 52:12.464
I'll be happy with the table first.

52:12.864 --> 52:14.387
Okay, okay.

52:15.410 --> 52:17.935
Which is even more fascinating.

52:18.175 --> 52:22.564
I can imagine he threatened me with a $15 million lawsuit.

52:22.949 --> 52:30.938
That's a lot of money.

52:31.058 --> 52:44.752
It was bought by Mrs. Crawford, who has sold it then to the valid museum in New York, back again to America.

52:44.793 --> 52:47.015
In the pocket edition.

52:47.075 --> 52:49.918
I don't know the name, it's the world's most famous name.

52:50.236 --> 52:54.846
Museum of Dance in New York.

52:55.587 --> 53:02.842
It's a special name for it, I can't remember.

53:06.410 --> 53:10.438
I'm sitting here because I am a collector.

53:10.722 --> 53:15.789
Oven Matz has been trying to complete my collection for a couple of years.

53:16.049 --> 53:24.140
And then I'm the editor of a rare book journal in Sweden.

53:25.081 --> 53:26.843
In English it's called The Book Friend.

53:27.404 --> 53:29.507
It was established in 1946.

53:29.667 --> 53:33.011
I've been the editor for three years.

53:33.852 --> 53:36.236
But maybe a new book friend.

53:36.276 --> 53:39.079
Yes, I will give you a breakdown of a new book friend.

53:39.139 --> 53:39.840
Just keep typing.

53:39.940 --> 53:40.341
Okay.

53:40.574 --> 53:54.014
I would say that the book friend has existed a long time, but when Lois started it is the new book friend, the new is not within, but it is quite different.

53:54.335 --> 53:56.178
Has it been uninterrupted?

53:56.238 --> 54:01.165
No, it is quite different.

54:01.921 --> 54:06.308
It was quite a nice journal in the 40s and 50s.

54:06.348 --> 54:13.979
That precedes, actually, the book collector in England, which is... Yes, yes.

54:14.480 --> 54:26.798
It had its... You can say that the journal had its roots or tradition in the... Well, when the working classes began to...

54:27.267 --> 54:27.848
Yes, I do.

54:27.868 --> 54:30.850
Stay in front of us, by the way, because I have to turn on the other side.

54:30.870 --> 54:48.726
When the working classes began to read in Sweden in the 30s and 40s, and when every small city in Sweden had its, you know, small bourgeois middle class that were book collectors in one way or the other, you know, the dentist, the priest, the professor, and all of them had their own small collection at home.

54:49.346 --> 54:54.771
Mostly some of them were bibliophiles, you know, they were collecting illustrated books and things like that.

54:54.811 --> 54:55.932
Actually, let me just interrupt.

54:55.952 --> 54:57.173
We have a very interesting...

54:57.288 --> 55:08.399
Here we have two booksellers, a collector, a librarian, bookseller, and a scout, a seller, an entrepreneur.

55:08.419 --> 55:13.283
I'm both a rare book librarian.

55:13.444 --> 55:14.765
And a rare book librarian.

55:14.825 --> 55:15.886
And I'm also a bookseller.

55:15.906 --> 55:16.827
And a bibliographer.

55:16.847 --> 55:18.288
And a bookseller.

55:18.789 --> 55:19.489
All of these things.

55:19.570 --> 55:26.316
And I think I'm one of the four or five booksellers in Sweden, which together with

55:26.532 --> 55:32.241
must are known abroad.

55:32.261 --> 55:37.288
Most of the adequate booksellers in Sweden are mostly second-hand books, you know.

55:38.350 --> 55:38.871
That's right.

55:38.931 --> 55:43.517
We are dealing with old Arab books.

55:43.538 --> 55:45.360
Not so many Arab books.

55:45.380 --> 55:48.064
It's a small country, though.

55:48.285 --> 55:50.608
We have to take into account, what, six million people?

55:51.630 --> 55:52.471
Nine.

55:52.731 --> 55:53.152
Nine.

55:53.212 --> 55:53.873
About eight.

55:54.038 --> 56:00.669
On the other hand, we have many booksellers compared to our population.

56:00.749 --> 56:01.310
Sure.

56:01.330 --> 56:02.832
Yes, second-hand booksellers.

56:02.853 --> 56:04.435
I read a lot today.

56:05.136 --> 56:11.306
Well, last week I was down printing the very last issue of the journal.

56:11.847 --> 56:14.031
Because the... The last, the most recent.

56:14.051 --> 56:15.273
No, the last.

56:15.513 --> 56:18.358
Because the... The device.

56:18.558 --> 56:28.710
Yeah, the Society of Book Friends that has published the journal for 50 years will now merge with the Society of the Book Arts and Crafts.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.211
Yes, something like that.

56:30.391 --> 56:33.815
Or Friends of the Royal Library there have been also.

56:34.336 --> 56:40.343
So we will close the journal down and start a new journal.

56:40.363 --> 56:43.266
It's called Nearly Biblio but Biblis.

56:43.381 --> 56:50.629
which is said to be, you know, the nickname of the Royal Library when it was in the Royal Castle.

56:51.990 --> 56:52.631
Yes, Biblis.

56:53.012 --> 56:54.954
How frequently do you publish quarterly?

56:54.974 --> 56:55.875
It's a quarterly, yes.

56:56.535 --> 56:59.339
So it will be... Yes, I will show it.

57:00.440 --> 57:01.761
Yes, thank you.

57:02.482 --> 57:09.810
It will be a much, well, hopefully better, grander, more beautiful... It's quite cool already, if I may say so.

57:10.094 --> 57:16.580
And, well, a better journal on rare books, a little bit more academic, maybe.

57:18.302 --> 57:19.102
Which is good.

57:19.703 --> 57:22.225
Yes, it is good, because... It won't be too much.

57:23.426 --> 57:24.387
No, it's a balance.

57:24.407 --> 57:27.570
It all depends on where you try to reach for your readership.

57:27.650 --> 57:29.532
Quality not the same as academic.

57:30.793 --> 57:36.639
You know, one of the criticisms of Biblio is that maybe it's not scholarly enough.

57:36.659 --> 57:39.021
And my attitude is, we've got the book collector.

57:39.676 --> 57:43.382
We have these journals that do that.

57:44.604 --> 57:48.590
I wrote a gentle madness for readers who care.

57:48.730 --> 57:52.376
I also wrote for the general reader.

57:52.396 --> 57:58.686
And I really, truly believe that that's an important... In other words, you couldn't have to get the population to grow.

57:59.107 --> 58:00.909
That's right.

58:01.230 --> 58:02.332
I can just show you.

58:02.372 --> 58:05.016
This is the very peak of the journal.

58:05.036 --> 58:06.358
It's 1959.

58:06.794 --> 58:32.734
uh the the the headline reads the king is reading the king can't read

58:32.866 --> 58:46.141
No, I was at the inauguration of the royal library, the new opening of the house.

58:46.661 --> 58:53.349
And the king, the Swedish king, couldn't say library in Swedish name for library.

58:55.111 --> 58:58.975
He said books instead.

58:59.562 --> 59:07.675
He and me, we divide one thing.

59:08.476 --> 59:13.424
I'm an Abraham, I have a problem with dyslexia.

59:15.247 --> 59:20.756
But the king is a rather serious problem.

59:20.876 --> 59:22.819
It's very beautiful.

59:23.052 --> 59:35.391
Yes, I can just show you.

59:35.972 --> 59:38.876
This was a very tight journal, you see.

59:38.916 --> 59:43.784
It was a very small topology and had quite a lot of articles in it.

59:44.184 --> 59:46.067
And then this is 1994.

59:46.107 --> 59:50.494
It's one of the last numbers before I became the editor.

59:50.727 --> 59:54.091
And it's very, well, it's very ugly, actually, and it's very boring.

59:54.331 --> 59:56.854
It was mostly on modern bookbinders.

59:56.954 --> 59:58.777
In literature, more than books?

59:58.797 --> 01:00:00.118
Yes, literature, more than books.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:03.763
How many copies did you credit?

01:00:04.283 --> 01:00:07.307
Well, in those times, it was 6,000.

01:00:08.008 --> 01:00:09.570
Yes, it was quite many, yes.

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:14.035
And then it was down to about 1,000, 1994.

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:15.591
And then came along.

01:00:15.852 --> 01:00:17.674
Then I came along.

01:00:17.974 --> 01:00:25.003
This is the first issue that I was the editor for, when Uwe wrote on Curiosity Cabinets and things like that.

01:00:25.023 --> 01:00:33.374
I saw an editor on Seven-Headed Pilgras in Hamburg.

01:00:33.394 --> 01:00:35.196
You are a graphic designer, right?

01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:35.997
No, I'm not.

01:00:36.117 --> 01:00:39.381
I'm a copywriter, actually, but I have friends who are...
