WEBVTT

00:04.317 --> 00:23.018
Well, yes, the financial situation... I mean, let's face it,

00:23.268 --> 00:33.599
asked me to come here and take this position operator.

00:33.619 --> 00:35.725
And then I say to them when I go to family, you know, I know everything.

00:35.907 --> 00:55.247
No, seriously, this is the undertaking .

00:55.267 --> 00:56.008
Think of the countries that you have.

00:56.028 --> 00:56.329
You have .

00:56.528 --> 00:58.491
And I did.

00:58.951 --> 00:59.752
And I did.

01:00.033 --> 01:02.897
But I could not help getting to just about certain materials.

01:02.917 --> 01:05.740
And, you know, it was fantastic.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.766
And I said, how can I say no unless it's one of the Italian materials?

01:09.786 --> 01:15.333
So the Italian material, which does not really get the recognition of the other stuff, you say is still very strong?

01:16.014 --> 01:17.897
It is strong.

01:18.037 --> 01:21.501
As you will see, it's probably structured without self-centeredness.

01:21.521 --> 01:21.662
Really?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.464
There is not a lot of it.

01:23.630 --> 01:28.998
Did this come mainly through purchase?

01:29.559 --> 01:30.500
Yes.

01:30.700 --> 01:46.343
During the time, Ransom, he wanted to enlarge the babies for the French languages.

01:46.363 --> 01:48.126
So he started on Italian, Latin, Spanish, French, and so on.

01:48.146 --> 01:49.948
That's what they wanted to do because it was important at the time.

01:49.968 --> 01:50.890
It was this idea of interested in the study.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.472
Now the idea has come back.

01:52.655 --> 02:06.768
But the money situation is not the same.

02:06.788 --> 02:10.711
So you cannot go out and buy everything you want.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.873
That is very difficult.

02:12.893 --> 02:15.415
I mean, the situation has changed.

02:15.435 --> 02:15.936
No question about it.

02:15.956 --> 02:16.897
The situation has changed.

02:16.917 --> 02:17.818
They value, they can always have changed.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.620
So what if somebody says, well, you know, you can actually lose this thing at all.

02:21.072 --> 02:32.415
Well, I don't like that, but I don't appreciate that coming because I said, well, look, if you think only in terms of money and buying things, well, that's how you might have to do it myself to begin with.

02:32.783 --> 02:42.453
But yes, in this case, no, I haven't gotten it yet, but I haven't even arrived yet.

02:42.473 --> 02:54.305
But on the other hand, it seems to me that there has been a great deal of law and movement and activities from within, the thing that I have created.

02:54.325 --> 02:55.786
And I have been really great in this gap.

02:55.806 --> 02:58.850
I have been, you know, asked to do and to do lectures in different places, in other places.

02:58.870 --> 03:00.751
And that all has been generated from what I have done.

03:00.772 --> 03:01.272
So it seems to me,

03:01.488 --> 03:12.749
That is important too, because if they say, all right, I cannot buy any more, then I say, all right, then I'll do something.

03:12.769 --> 03:14.733
But is the policy not to get any more Italian right now?

03:14.753 --> 03:22.547
Well, that's what it is, that's what it is, because the money is kind of hard time.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.070
So naturally, you know, the acquisition is going to be

03:24.455 --> 03:32.001
towards enriching the material that are considerably important and that we have to offer.

03:33.027 --> 03:40.016
You know, to me, I feel we really have to take care of everything we have.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.504
We have a lot.

03:45.964 --> 03:46.886
We have a lot.

03:46.966 --> 03:55.457
But on the other hand, from a financial point of view, if you have little money, clearly you are going to spend it on something that you, or whatever,

03:55.690 --> 04:17.796
You have to get out and get the money.

04:17.816 --> 04:24.364
How long has it been since you've been a major enthusiast?

04:24.901 --> 04:50.605
We had fantastic opportunities and we could really go up there, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money, we would have the money,

04:51.918 --> 05:01.205
So he really wasn't interested in anything?

05:01.526 --> 05:04.695
Well, the funny thing is that he was interested

05:05.114 --> 05:18.205
in the Renaissance period.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.912
Because I remember when I didn't know him, I was delighted to put up an interview because he made me to go to the Renaissance period.

05:20.932 --> 05:22.395
Because also, this man is very much interested in the Renaissance period.

05:22.415 --> 05:23.077
And he was quite enjoying it.

05:23.097 --> 05:23.578
So while he was here,

05:24.622 --> 05:53.835
So that was a gift.

05:54.406 --> 06:07.867
So, this is what really happened.

06:07.887 --> 06:09.270
So, when you came here, you were able to do it.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.211
And so long you decided that you got to do it.

06:10.231 --> 06:10.812
All of them, all of them did.

06:10.792 --> 06:17.839
208 or something like that.

06:21.783 --> 06:25.947
That is exquisite.

06:25.967 --> 06:26.347
They are wonderful.

06:26.367 --> 06:28.489
We've had already about 500 books with maybe about 505 of them.

06:28.509 --> 06:29.290
And I agree to that.

06:29.310 --> 06:37.938
I put them all together and I have a couple of cards with a representation of the wrapping so that I'm really beginning to look better for that.

06:37.958 --> 06:38.318
I've done so much.

06:38.338 --> 06:38.959
I've been here for a long time.

06:39.665 --> 06:50.845
And I would say that the balance is definitely positive.

06:50.865 --> 06:53.951
What I want the beginning to do, and what I want the English to do.

06:53.971 --> 06:55.173
And I always try to wonder what I'm saying.

06:55.193 --> 07:00.222
And they say this particular text in English is an argument that they publish in this entire journal, which is one of the major

07:00.573 --> 07:07.105
the library in Germany and I was very happy with that.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.207
This is exactly the same text.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.910
Okay, did you write this text?

07:10.110 --> 07:10.851
No, I did.

07:10.871 --> 07:21.450
Because when I wrote this and I went to give a lecture, basically the editor, they asked me if I could do this.

07:24.029 --> 07:30.778
Yeah, and I get to the sun with a person at the time.

07:30.798 --> 07:34.823
It's a kind of person who doesn't tell you what to do.

07:34.843 --> 07:36.826
And I say, oh, no.

07:37.286 --> 07:42.153
That's why I'm so mad in the middle of my most productive time.

07:42.653 --> 07:43.254
You don't care?

07:43.274 --> 07:46.358
Well, then I'll do it.

07:47.165 --> 07:56.030
I mean, I don't know, it's just an application, you can actually do whatever, but I had been really very interested in what I've been doing.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.293
I've sort of broken out the lessons and everything that we do.

07:57.661 --> 08:03.047
They are wonderful.

08:03.067 --> 08:20.605
In fact, there was a conference in Victoria, in the time of Texas.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.165
And then we had a new year.

08:21.185 --> 08:21.586
We had it last year.

08:21.606 --> 08:23.027
We had an open discussion in September, and then they did stay on until

08:23.159 --> 08:51.630
and now we are thinking about making it so that we can really just make it so that we can really just make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that we can make it so that

08:51.610 --> 09:09.990
And then, because of how it's sort of a comparative culture, sometimes even when you think that I'm actually trying to make a lot of connection, one of these issues that we find together, you can turn out

09:10.257 --> 09:31.357
of the fact that I discovered that we have here about four hundred and a hundred years in Carlota.

09:31.377 --> 09:32.478
So in GF, sometimes we have this sort of historic site.

09:32.498 --> 09:34.800
And to mention of the material in GF is just magic, you know, because it is a very, very kind of experience.

09:34.820 --> 09:35.381
These are the letters.

09:35.761 --> 09:35.921
Yes.

09:35.941 --> 09:36.422
These are parts.

09:36.442 --> 09:36.822
Part of the letters

09:36.802 --> 09:57.725
But he said it was interesting, the first period of material and the love of life, and he asked if they could publish them.

09:57.745 --> 09:58.166
Do you research them?

09:58.186 --> 09:58.826
No, we send them the microphone.

09:58.846 --> 10:01.189
What I did, I gave, in theory, a lecture about the letters, and I was there with a friend of mine who had to journal.

10:01.388 --> 10:11.246
So, what I'm saying, sometimes, anything that has any connection with Italian, I can, it can be shown a little bit.

10:11.266 --> 10:12.969
So, it's a question of knowledge.

10:12.989 --> 10:13.751
That's exactly what Dr. Ramsey said.

10:13.771 --> 10:14.672
Well, it made a big splash.

10:14.693 --> 10:17.578
I know that in 1973 is when they brought the maximum.

10:18.139 --> 10:18.640
Exactly, exactly.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.048
And it was a big splash because Milton even knew they were available.

10:23.068 --> 10:23.789
Dr. Ramsey knew everybody.

10:23.809 --> 10:24.190
I know.

10:24.372 --> 10:25.214
I know.

10:25.234 --> 10:29.763
And you see, that's the way he would find things.

10:29.783 --> 10:29.923
He won.

10:29.943 --> 10:32.107
And he didn't know who was going into it.

10:32.528 --> 10:38.420
And one time, one time, this gentleman who was in the registry, he said, no, no, we are going to let go.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.723
It's interesting looking at the material.

10:39.743 --> 10:39.883
What?

10:39.863 --> 11:01.148
So, you know, at that time, my mother was leaving, and so I called her up, and so I needed to talk to the president of the history of education.

11:01.168 --> 11:03.772
So I gave him a lecture about five, five years ago, in the honor of the historian, I think, and I think, and everything.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.373
And when he was there, he said, well, he was just getting in on his education.

11:05.393 --> 11:06.715
So this, perhaps, is going a bit outside of my

11:07.792 --> 11:23.138
But I mean, if he's a way of bringing out some of the material, that's not really, you know.

11:23.158 --> 11:24.400
And what came out of my lecture, oh yes, I gave it.

11:24.921 --> 11:28.146
And they, to me as well,

11:28.430 --> 11:51.971
What does that poster say?

11:52.492 --> 11:58.437
The manuscript of the Count of Correcta preserved in the United States.

11:58.417 --> 12:16.846
And this was the thing that when I walked in the bulletin, this was my meeting with a rector, a president, and I would be giving him a little context of time by coming up.

12:16.866 --> 12:22.315
And I was like, I told that by coming up and I was a little bit of the other.

12:22.295 --> 12:25.679
It was fantastic.

12:25.779 --> 12:42.917
I mean, you know, there I was giving my lecture in the day before, and it had Giovanni Agnelli who was speaking, and the day before, who was the John Delors.

12:42.937 --> 12:48.143
And like, for instance, the last thing that we discovered, we often have a thing that you've been here.

12:48.163 --> 12:51.306
So much material was bought, entire collections.

12:51.809 --> 12:54.234
They didn't have the stuff.

12:54.434 --> 12:59.423
I wasn't here yet.

12:59.684 --> 13:05.755
And they just put aside things that were said about it.

13:05.775 --> 13:07.378
And so all of a sudden, you know, something.

13:07.398 --> 13:08.821
That's one thing, as I have to say, is fantastic.

13:08.841 --> 13:11.205
The best thing to do is immediately when he came, he ordered a complete survey of all of his children from populous.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.788
But if he saw the from populous films, now what do you mean, do you mean this?

13:12.768 --> 13:37.785
Crazy.

13:39.688 --> 13:39.788
Stop.

13:40.240 --> 13:54.441
And how is from the land?

13:54.461 --> 13:54.602
It was.

13:54.622 --> 13:57.606
It was time time, you know, I think it happened in some religion.

13:57.626 --> 13:58.367
And it was kind of relaxed out there.

13:58.387 --> 14:00.911
You know that, it was the interior, you know, nobody knows that.

14:00.931 --> 14:01.672
I'm talking about the kind of motion.

14:01.692 --> 14:02.153
The levee at the levee?

14:02.173 --> 14:02.834
Yeah, it kind of is.

14:02.854 --> 14:04.036
Oh yeah, my hair, my hair, my hair.

14:04.056 --> 14:04.877
That's okay, I'll just show you.

14:04.897 --> 14:05.157
It's in here.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.840
Oh, it's in here, okay, yeah.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.863
And so, of course, that was, you know, it was big, you know, big movement, that's what I was saying.

14:09.434 --> 14:27.062
was not published in Africa, because in America I also think that I'm an artist.

14:27.082 --> 14:27.262
He knows.

14:27.282 --> 14:28.264
And, you know, that really is the research of me.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.646
You know, I'm the only one who knows the significance of this thing.

14:29.666 --> 14:32.691
When I had a uniquely drawn in November, this one of his friends, the author died in 2005.

14:33.346 --> 14:52.572
And I was just like, all right, I'm going to ask anything to do.

14:52.592 --> 14:52.853
And I got it.

14:52.873 --> 14:54.094
And so I was sitting down at the house of the altar.

14:54.135 --> 14:54.936
She's just with me.

14:54.976 --> 14:56.938
I have a book-review letter of my newspaper.

14:56.958 --> 14:57.179
Oh, I see.

14:57.199 --> 15:02.526
And I have an Italian professor at Holy Cross College by the name of Maurizio Vandicelli.

15:03.198 --> 15:10.244
So whenever I get anything fine in a canon opera, I send it to him and he gives me these wonderful reviews.

15:10.324 --> 15:11.545
So we have done the canonies.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.307
We have done that.

15:13.547 --> 15:13.667
Okay.

15:13.687 --> 15:14.408
Well, right.

15:14.428 --> 15:24.636
And of course, she were a friend of the family from way back when he was here.

15:24.676 --> 15:25.938
And so it was just disgusting.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.619
And she gave me the suggestion of all of these things.

15:27.639 --> 15:28.320
I thought I knew what he wrote.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.320
But it would be kind of a story within the story.

15:29.341 --> 15:32.243
Because it's the story of the manuscript, how it came here,

15:33.033 --> 15:56.519
And the story of his being in Lithuania in 35, 36, and why did he wait until 43 to lie to the world?

15:56.539 --> 15:57.580
And what condition was he under when he got to live?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.902
So he was in persecution, protected in this house.

15:58.922 --> 16:00.103
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:01.838 --> 16:21.121
And so he began writing the story as an original one of his friends, written by talk about a month ago.

16:21.141 --> 16:25.346
I mean, you know, this is coming out really, really extremely, not only, but on the manuscript, but he did some sketches.

16:25.366 --> 16:26.367
He was saying, well, not the class of the library.

16:26.387 --> 16:27.528
He was on the block, of course, but he was saying them.

16:27.548 --> 16:28.529
And he did some sketches on the manuscript.

16:28.549 --> 16:29.871
And she told me, you know, the sketches of the manuscript.

16:30.155 --> 16:35.802
So it was fantastic.

16:35.822 --> 16:37.984
It's going to be a very good story.

16:38.144 --> 16:40.547
It's going to be around the time.

16:41.148 --> 16:47.335
I barely gave myself to that.

16:47.355 --> 16:52.481
So you see, that's what I mean when I say no.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.323
You still have treasures that are still there to be my...

16:54.488 --> 17:09.463
Exactly, exactly.

17:09.483 --> 17:16.831
And to bring them up, the people to come in and see what I'm very better than they talk to each other with our mission.

17:16.851 --> 17:20.575
You know, that's the reason why I began, you know, being in life was a really good place, because when I realized, I thought, oh, do some work, don't do this, don't do this, don't do it.

17:20.595 --> 17:21.155
You know, that's what it is.

17:21.175 --> 17:22.977
It's doing, you know, that's really very, I feel very strongly that's my ability to do it.

17:22.957 --> 17:46.230
And it's funny because I have really been putting into all of my, let's say, my mind or something.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.894
And now I'm beginning to get something, to do something in the American collection of cards, but no one can say it.

17:48.914 --> 17:49.275
No one can say it.

17:49.295 --> 17:49.876
You know, I hate to sound it.

17:49.896 --> 17:50.837
Never the last, you know, as long as I think,

17:51.273 --> 18:14.862
It has been an extremely, extremely interesting work and combined with that.

18:14.882 --> 18:15.463
Who is the pretty young girl?

18:15.483 --> 18:15.643
Come on.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.764
So you have your daughter's husband?

18:19.064 --> 18:19.545
Yes, yes.

18:19.985 --> 18:32.863
But the boss, she and my older daughter, who is one of the participants to do a lot.

18:32.883 --> 18:33.043
Oh, wow.

18:33.063 --> 18:35.887
She's like, yeah, she's just following the other day, and she's up again doing all of the designs for the certain members have nothing to do.

18:35.907 --> 18:36.147
I'm excited.

18:36.228 --> 18:57.455
Yeah, I was really, but they got treated quite often.

18:57.475 --> 18:58.096
We have two guys.

18:59.858 --> 19:00.519
Eight and seven.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.560
Oh, well.

19:02.097 --> 19:11.702
It takes me a hell of a time reading, and that's what I need, I need to know about the situation, and that's what I need to do.
