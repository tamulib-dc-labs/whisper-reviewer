00:01.820 --> 00:04.140
I came in and took her away.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.552
Name your kids for me.

00:05.735 --> 00:07.978
The oldest child is Catherine.

00:07.998 --> 00:08.418
Okay.

00:08.979 --> 00:10.221
K-A-T-H-R-Y-N.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.983
And the younger one is Alice.

00:12.003 --> 00:12.303
Alice.

00:12.563 --> 00:13.845
And how old is Catherine?

00:13.865 --> 00:14.826
Catherine is four and a half.

00:15.007 --> 00:15.427
Oh, great.

00:15.447 --> 00:15.687
Nice.

00:15.948 --> 00:17.029
I have two girls as well.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.531
Yeah, how old are they?

00:19.732 --> 00:20.473
They're, let's see now.

00:20.493 --> 00:22.055
Barbara will be, she's 14.

00:22.095 --> 00:23.757
They're 14 and 13.

00:23.797 --> 00:25.640
They're 13 months apart.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.242
My wife was a saint.

00:28.023 --> 00:29.004
Uh-huh.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.265
That is hard.

00:30.586 --> 00:31.867
It was unbelievable.

00:31.887 --> 00:33.309
It's nice now, I have to say.

00:33.329 --> 00:33.970
Yeah.

00:34.473 --> 00:35.314
It is.

00:35.334 --> 00:37.757
This second one has really thrown us off balance.

00:37.777 --> 00:39.418
Yeah, well, I mean, you had a couple of years there.

00:39.478 --> 00:42.402
This was not intended, but what are you going to do?

00:42.442 --> 00:44.143
These little blessings are coming.

00:44.164 --> 00:46.386
You accept them.

00:46.406 --> 00:48.168
Anyway, they're great.

00:49.249 --> 00:49.649
Great kids.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.211
Girls are the best, I must say.

00:51.752 --> 00:56.817
I'm the only male in the house, including the Labrador Retriever and the cat, for that matter.

00:56.937 --> 00:58.759
That's my husband's physician that page.

00:58.779 --> 00:59.400
He's pretty happy with us, too.

01:00.292 --> 01:02.535
Listen, I think I've got plenty of stuff.

01:03.016 --> 01:03.256
Okay.

01:03.577 --> 01:04.919
And I'm going to move this right along.

01:05.980 --> 01:11.428
So I'll make sure either if you want me to send you copies directly, I'd be happy to do that.

01:13.391 --> 01:14.032
Okay.

01:14.072 --> 01:15.334
I'll be working on it.

01:15.374 --> 01:18.138
Like, actually, I'm going to just go get some coffee and I'll start transferring.

01:18.158 --> 01:19.560
I'm going to work on it right now.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.783
Well, thanks so much for doing this.

01:21.803 --> 01:22.544
Well, it's my pleasure.

01:22.565 --> 01:24.487
And believe me, I wouldn't do it if I didn't want to.

01:24.768 --> 01:25.669
And Alan knows that.

01:25.969 --> 01:26.350
Yeah.

01:26.768 --> 01:28.851
And, I mean, I only do the books I want to do.

01:29.632 --> 01:39.265
So, in fact, this was my, you know, actually, I'm here, I'm looking at the back of the dust jacket, and they say, well, here is a visionary world rooted in the knowledge of Pol Kafka.

01:39.285 --> 01:40.346
Borges, did you see this?

01:40.967 --> 01:42.309
Yeah.

01:42.329 --> 01:44.311
Oh, that was, yeah, Dave Smith.

01:44.332 --> 01:45.813
Dave Smith, yeah.

01:47.676 --> 01:50.340
Something he wrote about the stories, I guess.

01:50.360 --> 01:50.700
Yeah.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.223
Okay.

01:52.243 --> 01:53.969
I think this is just fine.

01:53.989 --> 01:57.603
And if there are any other questions, I won't hesitate to give you a call.

01:57.804 --> 01:58.928
And I enjoyed talking to you.

01:59.169 --> 01:59.249
Yep.

01:59.269 --> 01:59.851
Thanks a lot.

01:59.871 --> 02:00.413
And good luck.

02:00.795 --> 02:00.875
Yep.

02:00.895 --> 02:01.758
Bye-bye.

02:01.778 --> 02:01.939
Bye-bye.
