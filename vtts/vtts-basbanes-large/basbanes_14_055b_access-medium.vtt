00:01.499 --> 00:08.687
Well, this is in here, a Lombard graduate from the 14th century, 13th century.

00:08.707 --> 00:09.227
Look at that.

00:09.608 --> 00:10.428
Fabulous binding.

00:10.448 --> 00:11.910
That's really useful for instruction.

00:12.611 --> 00:14.212
Kelm Scott Chaucer is on this truck.

00:14.232 --> 00:16.375
You can pretty much write the presentation.

00:16.395 --> 00:17.176
Paper or vellum?

00:17.476 --> 00:18.717
Paper, in that case paper.

00:19.618 --> 00:29.869
This was a presentation about the Civil War and anti-slavery, which will be cobbled together again to do another course on African American history tomorrow that I'm doing.

00:30.558 --> 00:31.820
So you teach?

00:32.881 --> 00:33.723
I do presentations.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.265
I also teach in the English department.

00:35.285 --> 00:43.396
I teach a graduate course on 19th and 20th century literature in its social context.

00:43.416 --> 00:45.620
And do you use artifacts?

00:45.860 --> 00:48.123
It's completely built around the collection.

00:49.045 --> 00:54.573
So we deal with questions about... What's the name of the course?

00:54.613 --> 00:56.295
It's called Text in Context.

00:56.647 --> 01:01.555
materials and methods for the understanding of the historical and social context of 1920.

01:01.655 --> 01:03.258
Is it a graduate course?

01:03.278 --> 01:10.851
It's a graduate course, meant for people who are on the verge of doing their research.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.476
And it's completely material-oriented.

01:13.576 --> 01:16.781
Can you Xerox a course description of it from the catalog for me?

01:16.801 --> 01:18.945
Sure, sure.

01:18.965 --> 01:21.329
It's the kind of thing that'll get into my book.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.030
Ah, okay.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.253
There's a similar, it's not an unusual course.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.436
No, but you teach it and I'm talking to you right now.

01:28.596 --> 01:32.620
I don't have to go find somebody else who teaches it.

01:32.680 --> 01:51.257
This is one of the advantages of this particular, moving on from that, from this particular design is that when I'm doing 19th century literature, it's possible for me to bring in 15, 20, 30 titles in triple-decker.

01:52.182 --> 02:04.844
in three books, so that I can give one to each student in the class so that I can spend time... Do you admonish them about what you're about to allow them to hold?

02:07.428 --> 02:11.575
There's a constant sort of...

02:13.597 --> 02:18.624
dialogue about how to handle books, although the course starts off with how to handle books.

02:18.644 --> 02:21.068
But they're researchers, and they need to learn how to do that.

02:21.128 --> 02:29.200
Part of a graduate education is how to behave in an archive and how to do research as a literary historian or an historian or an anthropologist.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.083
So you don't slap hands, so to speak.

02:31.263 --> 02:31.804
No, no.

02:31.904 --> 02:40.937
I usually will hand somebody, as is the rule for the reading room, those props are there because pages are instructed when they bring a book out

02:41.120 --> 02:44.184
to set the book up in its appropriate fashion.

02:44.204 --> 02:55.840
And they're taught to inform readers, you need to keep this on the cushion, you need to remove the side pocket when you get halfway past the middle of the book because of the way the cover works.

02:56.321 --> 02:57.923
You always instruct them.

02:57.943 --> 03:00.426
This needs to lie flat because of the way it's sewn.

03:00.466 --> 03:01.548
Please don't prop it up.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.651
And do you use gloves?

03:03.691 --> 03:04.472
Do they use gloves here?

03:04.492 --> 03:08.758
They use gloves here only if they're working with photographs or medieval manuscripts.

03:09.018 --> 03:09.118
Okay.

03:09.993 --> 03:17.025
few other vague items, or vague criteria for items, but otherwise no, just plain hands.

03:17.065 --> 03:21.152
No, they're not admonished, they're being taught.

03:21.252 --> 03:33.453
Students are actually much better with books than researchers, independent scholars who come in, because they're used to it, and it's just the stuff of their work.

03:33.473 --> 03:34.735
This is still news to them.

03:35.052 --> 03:36.674
graduate students in the undergrad.

03:36.754 --> 03:38.436
And they still are in one day?

03:38.456 --> 03:39.337
They're a little afraid of it.

03:39.417 --> 03:44.202
Actually, your greatest concern is that they're being too delicate with the material and that they're likely to drop it.

03:44.222 --> 03:45.924
And it's better that they just take a good book.

03:45.964 --> 03:53.593
What would you say is the most, I hate to use the word valuable, but I've used the word anyway.

03:53.613 --> 03:56.416
We spend so much of our time here avoiding the notion of treasure.

03:56.576 --> 03:56.897
Okay.

03:56.917 --> 04:00.321
But I suppose it would be, well.

04:00.881 --> 04:01.282
Dearest.

04:01.362 --> 04:03.304
What item would you,

04:03.503 --> 04:07.308
be most concerned about having damage that you've brought into a class, shall we say?

04:07.449 --> 04:09.311
Oh, heavens.

04:09.491 --> 04:11.054
I won't even answer that question.

04:11.074 --> 04:12.736
There is no damage to material.

04:12.756 --> 04:22.270
The Gettysburg Address, but it's in a container that's sealed, so there's no way that... That's a handwritten... An autographed manuscript of the Gettysburg Address.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.915
But I'll show you the 13th Amendment, which is also an autographed manuscript, is just framed.

04:27.136 --> 04:32.464
So having a glass tarot, there's no way that... Wow.

04:34.469 --> 04:37.131
38th Congress of the United States of America.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.974
There's Lincoln's signature about a third of the way down.

04:40.735 --> 04:42.376
Right.

04:43.097 --> 04:44.558
Right about there.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.440
Put your finger down on the glass.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.141
Move over.

04:47.321 --> 04:47.821
More to me.

04:48.542 --> 04:48.742
There.

04:49.242 --> 04:50.784
Oh, Abraham Lincoln.

04:50.804 --> 04:53.106
And then the rest of these signatures are the House and Senate.

04:54.647 --> 04:55.128
That's great.

04:55.288 --> 04:56.689
Part of the anti-slavery collection.

04:59.332 --> 05:03.075
How does that... Why is that not in the National Archives?

05:03.258 --> 05:08.685
That has to do with the notion of law in the 19th century when they convert to a printed code being the law.

05:09.146 --> 05:11.469
The actual signed document is no longer the law.

05:12.911 --> 05:23.144
And as a result, it can be given away oftentimes as a gesture to someone who was heavily involved in making it happen.

05:23.265 --> 05:25.548
And then it came on the market.

05:25.608 --> 05:28.231
It was acquired for us by the Noyes family.

05:29.933 --> 05:31.556
The Washington Star Noyes family?

05:31.576 --> 05:32.577
The Nicholas Noyes.

05:32.597 --> 05:32.657
Oh.

05:33.430 --> 05:38.017
And there was a Noyes family that owned the Lillie?

05:38.658 --> 05:41.663
The Noyes family that ultimately linked up with the Lillie family.

05:42.544 --> 05:42.925
Okay.

05:45.248 --> 05:55.945
In fact, descendants of Nicholas Noyes were just here last week, and he reminded us that his family married

05:56.178 --> 06:03.607
the Lilly family, and I said, well, I'll have to call Lisa Brower then and tell her that I'll be happy to make arrangements for the return of all the noise material that said Lilly.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.815
I guess the Gettysburg Address, but there are other materials here that are of equal significance.

06:09.855 --> 06:11.357
The Audubon certainly is there.

06:12.218 --> 06:19.548
There are certain literary manuscripts here that are of great importance.

06:19.788 --> 06:20.689
The collection is full of it.

06:20.709 --> 06:25.155
We really try and the Wordsworth Collection has one of the Bristol

06:25.591 --> 06:28.756
copies, so that's one of four in existence.

06:29.938 --> 06:44.540
There are certainly medieval manuscripts here that are worth a great deal of money, and some of which are significant in terms of illumination and scribal work, or even as initial texts.

06:46.243 --> 06:52.813
So what you do is you develop a program where that doesn't happen, I guess.

06:54.633 --> 06:58.358
This is Ezra Cornell's safe.

06:58.758 --> 06:59.219
Look at that, huh?

06:59.239 --> 07:03.044
And for many years it was used to house the Nobel Prizes that are in our collection.

07:05.106 --> 07:05.527
What's this?

07:06.428 --> 07:06.889
Corning?

07:07.009 --> 07:09.192
Corning and Company.

07:09.212 --> 07:10.273
Corning and Company, agent.

07:10.353 --> 07:21.127
Corning... I'm not sure if this is the reference to what turns into Corning Glass, which is near Ithaca, Corning, New York.

07:21.587 --> 07:22.008
Right.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.471
Ezra... What was Ezra's...

07:25.345 --> 07:27.027
And what did he do, Ezra Cornell?

07:27.047 --> 07:33.235
Ezra Cornell, his fortune was built off of the telegraph of the machine union.

07:34.837 --> 07:43.588
And he was also in the state government, which is where he met A.D.

07:43.628 --> 07:46.071
White, which is how Cornell University was founded.
