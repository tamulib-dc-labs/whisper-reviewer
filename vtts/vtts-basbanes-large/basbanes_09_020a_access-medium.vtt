00:02.900 --> 00:08.205
I guess we're talking now of Robert Giroux at Cambridge.

00:09.767 --> 00:10.868
Tell me a little bit.

00:10.888 --> 00:13.470
I mean, you didn't intend to do this.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.493
Somebody else was going to do this.

00:16.513 --> 00:18.955
Yeah, it was David David Colston.

00:18.975 --> 00:23.940
It actually attracted Lailene Barker.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.784
David Colston, who wrote Becoming a Poet.

00:28.845 --> 00:29.926
Okay.

00:31.127 --> 00:32.248
He, uh...

00:32.768 --> 00:36.592
had contracted to do the letters, came ill and died.

00:37.032 --> 00:42.397
And Alice Metfessel, the literary executor, asked me to take on the job.

00:43.298 --> 00:47.422
I had already edited the collective prose of Elizabeth Bishop, and I agreed.

00:48.783 --> 00:52.867
I had no idea what a job it was going to be.

00:52.887 --> 01:00.534
I had edited other people's editing of groups of letters, you know, like Sally Fitzgerald's book of Planner and Connor's letters.

01:00.634 --> 01:01.915
Which I think is one of the great things

01:02.198 --> 01:31.345
but it's quite a different thing to edit somebody else's editing artist off and scratch because to my horror I've learned that Colston who might send a number of letters my own letters I'd received from Elizabeth and one or two other things the only letters he had collected were those of Marion Moore and Robert Lowe which of course he needed for his book on becoming a poet

01:32.050 --> 01:43.846
So I had to advertise and send out notices and so on in the New York papers, in London, in Chicago, Los Angeles, and then in Canada.

01:43.906 --> 01:46.530
And then the letters started to pour in.

01:46.870 --> 01:47.150
Really?

01:47.190 --> 01:49.934
Must have plucked it over.

01:49.954 --> 01:50.895
3,000 letters.

01:50.915 --> 01:51.616
Right, right.

01:51.917 --> 01:56.263
And I was astonished, you know, that she had so much correspondence.

01:56.964 --> 01:58.506
And I'm sure there's a lot I didn't get.

01:58.526 --> 01:58.926
Yeah.

01:59.948 --> 02:00.268
So...

02:00.670 --> 02:08.658
I figured at most it would be a book of, you know, 500 letters, which is about one of it.

02:08.798 --> 02:09.138
Right.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.602
So I finally whittled it down.

02:12.622 --> 02:16.346
I had to read all, most of the letters, actually, to find out.

02:16.366 --> 02:28.618
And I segregated them into, you know, what I thought were the most interesting, the most provocative, and key points of her career, and that sort of readability.

02:29.324 --> 02:34.348
you know, intrinsic interest, that sort of rationale.

02:37.111 --> 02:43.577
And I found out, I knew it would have to be a big book, because it had to cover her whole life, and she lived in 1968.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.878
She was hit 70.

02:45.478 --> 02:47.980
She was born in 1911, died in 1978.

02:48.281 --> 02:50.182
So, 67 or 68.

02:50.202 --> 02:52.404
68, she passed her.

02:52.805 --> 02:57.829
I think she made it to 79, actually, I'm not sure.

02:58.366 --> 03:00.169
Last letter in the book will tell you.

03:00.209 --> 03:01.972
That's the day she died.

03:02.352 --> 03:02.833
Tell me.

03:03.414 --> 03:07.761
I should remember that.

03:11.206 --> 03:12.669
Yeah, 79.

03:12.749 --> 03:13.209
You're right.

03:13.690 --> 03:19.339
I know because I had just recently been named book editor.

03:19.399 --> 03:23.426
I remember he died.

03:23.486 --> 03:23.726
Right.

03:23.906 --> 03:26.230
So, it was a long life.

03:26.632 --> 03:35.605
My rationale was simply, as I say, letters with intrinsic interest and also covering key points of her career.

03:36.065 --> 03:40.531
Did you think it would become the kind of autobiography that it did?

03:40.552 --> 03:51.607
Well, I thought it would, to some extent, would have to because it was covering the high points of her career, crucial moments and so on, dramatic incidents, a plot of suicide and so on.

03:51.647 --> 03:54.311
All that had to be somehow dealt with.

03:54.351 --> 03:55.913
So, yes, I mean, because...

03:56.163 --> 04:00.871
I think the drop copy says, it is in a sense a lot of biography.

04:01.552 --> 04:03.335
Her private life wasn't too well known.

04:03.435 --> 04:07.001
I didn't know very much about it.

04:07.021 --> 04:12.149
You mentioned, of course, in your introduction that she really cared, I mean, about writing letters.

04:12.490 --> 04:13.992
She taught a course.

04:14.012 --> 04:15.214
I discovered that.

04:15.234 --> 04:16.997
Allstone didn't seem to know that.

04:17.017 --> 04:19.802
There's William Alford here who teaches here.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.124
I guess he's emeritus now.

04:21.712 --> 04:22.453
But I spoke to him.

04:22.473 --> 04:24.595
He said, oh, yes, you have a course of letters.

04:24.955 --> 04:26.616
I said, love reading letters.

04:26.636 --> 04:27.017
Yes.

04:28.218 --> 04:29.079
So he dug it out.

04:29.559 --> 04:34.403
Do you think that she had any sense that she was writing these letters?

04:34.423 --> 04:39.828
I mean, you mentioned that particularly letters to Marianne Moore or Robert Lowell she really labored over.

04:39.848 --> 04:43.111
Because not for posterity, I don't think.

04:43.652 --> 04:50.638
I think it was just that those are the two people she admired and respected most and felt she had to...

04:51.175 --> 04:52.977
You know, he had her best.

04:53.057 --> 04:56.061
And you can tell, reading them, they're perfectly natural, that is.

04:56.121 --> 05:03.809
But, you know, and it could be Marion Moore, they become more and more relaxed and intimate and so on, friendly.

05:03.829 --> 05:11.138
She was very formal at first, but she was like that with me a couple of years before she sort of, you know.

05:11.158 --> 05:14.341
I guess I never truly appreciated how much of an affection she is.

05:14.702 --> 05:16.444
Oh, you know, right?

05:16.504 --> 05:17.605
And not in her letters.

05:18.158 --> 05:22.383
She found it easy to write letters, thank God, you know, that's why there were so many of them.

05:23.064 --> 05:32.114
But it was in contrast to her poems, which there are so many fragments of interesting poems, you know, poems she started and wouldn't finish or didn't finish.

05:32.535 --> 05:37.981
The fact that she took 16 years to write the moves, I don't know any other poet.

05:38.622 --> 05:42.326
Not a poem, and she promised it to an aunt.

05:42.366 --> 05:43.407
Dedicated to her, yeah.

05:43.758 --> 05:46.762
You've got to wait 16 years to get it, which is wonderful.

05:46.942 --> 05:54.632
In fact, the incident that inspired the poem was like six or seven years earlier than the 16, so it was almost 22 years.

05:55.473 --> 05:56.294
Astonishing.

05:56.314 --> 06:03.783
You know, we talked the first time, I think it was 12 or 13 years ago, at the Players Club in New York.

06:03.803 --> 06:07.808
We were talking about the various writers that you've worked with.

06:08.210 --> 06:15.397
I remember you saying Jack Kerouac was an important writer, but not a green writer.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.840
But this is a legitimate recertified role.

06:18.941 --> 06:24.146
Is this something that you knew at the time, or is this something that just rose gradually?

06:24.386 --> 06:25.427
I didn't know it at the time.

06:25.487 --> 06:27.990
No, I can't say that.

06:28.010 --> 06:32.474
And when you're close to something, as close as that, you're never quite sure.

06:33.535 --> 06:37.339
And, you know, when you think of

06:38.062 --> 06:42.807
how many years she worked, how many years she worked as a writer, I mean, and lived.

06:43.628 --> 06:46.872
See, really, it's a small body of work.

06:46.952 --> 06:52.438
It's a small body, but the collected poems is not a major, it's not a, it's a major book, it's not a huge book.

06:52.658 --> 06:58.024
It's not a huge book, not like Walt Whitman, you know, even Emily Dickinson.

06:58.044 --> 07:05.172
But it took me some years, some experience to learn that she was a perfectionist.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.634
She was harder on her own

07:06.884 --> 07:13.071
Critically speaking, she judged her own work much harder than other people did.

07:13.351 --> 07:19.458
When she finished something, she was always denigrating her own work, a habit I didn't like.

07:19.518 --> 07:22.362
I think it's wrong for her to do that.

07:22.842 --> 07:28.349
She had this puritanical streak of some kind that made her feel that.

07:28.789 --> 07:31.772
It might have been false modesty.

07:31.812 --> 07:35.777
I can't explain it, although she didn't seem false in any way.

07:36.095 --> 07:41.801
When she wrote In the Villages, it was a great story.

07:41.882 --> 07:43.543
Great work of prose, I think.

07:44.424 --> 07:48.910
One of the best stories ever written by an American.

07:51.092 --> 07:52.413
She didn't want to write it.

07:52.434 --> 07:56.458
She said, oh, you know, it's all the fussing about itself.

07:57.139 --> 07:59.582
I don't know, is it really worth all this trouble and so on?

08:00.623 --> 08:03.987
She just, I never heard her say, that's terrific.

08:04.007 --> 08:04.347
That's...

08:04.748 --> 08:06.170
You know, a wonderful thing.

08:06.190 --> 08:09.014
Even when it was wonderful, I could lose.

08:09.034 --> 08:19.770
When you say, pardon me, that she is perhaps, I don't know if you say the greatest, but certainly one of the greatest poets of the present century.

08:19.810 --> 08:20.291
No question.

08:20.852 --> 08:29.544
What is it that separates her from speaking as an editor now?

08:29.725 --> 08:30.285
It's true.

08:30.305 --> 08:33.490
First of all, it's a highly original style.

08:33.993 --> 08:41.500
It is immediately attractive to the general reader like me because it's simple.

08:42.401 --> 08:48.347
There's no nonsense about what he's saying.

08:48.367 --> 08:52.671
There's no obfuscation, you know what I mean.

08:53.732 --> 09:01.419
And no pretense or no artifice, no attempt to conceal.

09:01.519 --> 09:02.700
It's absolutely direct.

09:03.085 --> 09:12.256
And because simplicity is the last thing an artist learns in Beethoven's greatest work with his last quartet, the simplest music you ever wrote.

09:12.756 --> 09:16.320
Shakespeare, to be or not to be, is third grade English when you think about it.

09:17.282 --> 09:19.524
So all monosyllabic words.

09:19.664 --> 09:20.786
Absolutely.

09:20.806 --> 09:21.506
Absolutely.

09:21.547 --> 09:25.311
And I don't want to say I have to talk about Shakespeare.

09:26.572 --> 09:29.235
I forgot I didn't get you going.

09:29.516 --> 09:31.138
What's the first line of Hamlet?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.299
How does it open?

09:32.482 --> 09:36.790
And you know the answer is, who's there?

09:36.871 --> 09:39.596
Who's there is about as contemporary as you can get.

09:40.698 --> 09:40.999
Who's there?

09:41.460 --> 09:44.927
And he could use that rubric and say, that's what the play is about.

09:44.947 --> 09:45.628
Who's there?

09:46.149 --> 09:49.636
Is my father hovering around as they go?

09:49.656 --> 09:52.802
You know, just... Anyway, she had that...

09:53.542 --> 09:59.950
a great gift of correctness and communication.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.655
I love that letter to Robert Wall, I mean, about this one word.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.740
I mean, this letter about a single word.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.422
I mean, the selection of the word.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.163
Which one was it?

10:10.183 --> 10:12.686
I can't remember the word, but I kind of forget myself.

10:12.706 --> 10:13.967
But you'd like that, yes.

10:14.268 --> 10:20.055
But this long, this colloquy back and forth about a single word.

10:20.390 --> 10:30.566
He said in his little poem about her, you know, you posted on your bulletin board with empties.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.328
Those are the words.

10:31.768 --> 10:33.050
She has to get the perfect word.

10:33.852 --> 10:39.801
And I had an editor, after she died, they said, oh, she's written a piece about Marion.

10:39.841 --> 10:42.345
Well, I found about seven versions.

10:43.327 --> 10:45.250
And I went through them and

10:45.820 --> 10:48.783
The difference was, you know, very slight.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.704
And you're speaking as an editor now.

10:50.724 --> 10:50.825
Yeah.

10:51.185 --> 10:53.647
And you would have happily accepted the first version?

10:53.747 --> 10:54.328
Absolutely.

10:54.768 --> 10:58.191
There's very little difference between the first one and the last one.

10:58.211 --> 11:01.494
And in the end, I started to say, if I don't do this, it's never going to be printed.

11:02.275 --> 11:06.819
And I just said, you know, this is what she's saying, and that's that.

11:07.059 --> 11:09.722
So she needed an editor.

11:10.683 --> 11:15.507
She was very off-putting, putting in the sense of, you know,

11:15.858 --> 11:18.001
Don't come too close.

11:18.081 --> 11:18.582
She had that.

11:19.884 --> 11:22.128
It's just independence or whatever.

11:22.728 --> 11:24.391
How you define it, it doesn't matter.

11:24.992 --> 11:26.114
You don't have to define it.

11:27.736 --> 11:28.698
She was a perfectionist.

11:28.718 --> 11:29.839
You've already said it.

11:29.859 --> 11:34.967
And to the nth degree, you know, very few writers are.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.012
Marion Moore was, and I think she was influenced by Marion Moore.

11:39.073 --> 11:39.955
She admired that.

11:39.995 --> 11:44.802
Yeah, but the difference between her and Marion Moore is that Marion Moore is, you know,

11:45.406 --> 11:52.236
highly imaginative, and enigmatic, and cryptic.

11:52.256 --> 11:57.203
Elizabeth was more willing to let her work go.

11:58.425 --> 12:02.090
And it seems to be that Elizabeth, you mentioned the seven versions.

12:02.171 --> 12:02.892
Right, right.

12:03.312 --> 12:08.680
She was very, I mean, there comes a point where you have to let this thing fly out of a nest.

12:09.031 --> 12:11.974
And of the fragments, you know, I went through her papers at Vassar.

12:12.014 --> 12:12.895
I was shocked.

12:13.355 --> 12:16.398
Then I found those unpublishments in the collected product.

12:16.418 --> 12:17.519
Marvelous stories.

12:17.759 --> 12:19.941
My wife just finished reading that.

12:19.961 --> 12:23.284
She said, these are wonderful, wonderful stories.

12:23.304 --> 12:26.127
And they would never have appeared if I hadn't.

12:26.147 --> 12:28.289
I felt like I discovered a gold mine.

12:29.910 --> 12:36.456
Mary Moore was the most puzzling to me because she obviously worked so hard on it.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.208
That's an illustration where she re-typed the whole thing.

12:40.550 --> 12:45.277
She did that in the village.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.400
I'm getting sick and tired of re-typing.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.504
Why does she have to re-type the whole thing?

12:50.524 --> 12:54.970
Other people, including Emily Dickinson, would make corrections.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.311
And Mary Moore.

12:56.432 --> 13:01.178
Mary Moore used to have a number of her letters, and she corrects them.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.842
She'll write you a letter of pen and ink.

13:04.903 --> 13:05.544
She'll edit it.

13:05.604 --> 13:10.048
How do you suppose she would have responded to the word processing?

13:10.068 --> 13:11.829
I doubt if she could have.

13:11.849 --> 13:13.070
I can't go with it.

13:13.090 --> 13:17.074
The beauty of it is the endless opportunity that gives you to revise.

13:17.995 --> 13:18.855
Maybe she would have liked it.

13:18.875 --> 13:25.181
I think that's one of the reasons that books, non-fiction books, are getting longer and longer is because you can insert things with ease.

13:25.201 --> 13:27.503
You don't have to read this whole manuscript.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.045
It's not the chore used to be.

13:30.065 --> 13:30.726
That's true.

13:31.043 --> 13:36.490
You mentioned Walt Whitman, of course, who did nine versions of this concept.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.412
And no one was better than the first.

13:38.873 --> 13:41.095
Song of Myself is a masterpiece.

13:41.476 --> 13:45.241
Then it gets, you know, more and more rhetorical.

13:45.261 --> 13:48.505
I'm not familiar with her work cap.

13:48.785 --> 13:53.931
Even though work was completed work, do you think she'd like to have a little whack at it?

13:54.031 --> 13:55.133
She talked about it.

13:55.373 --> 13:58.517
She made a little fun of Lowell, you know, Rob.

13:59.178 --> 14:01.000
And in her last poem, after his death,

14:01.857 --> 14:04.180
You revise, revise, revise, and so on.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.041
But she did, too.

14:06.103 --> 14:07.164
She did, too.

14:07.184 --> 14:13.632
And that one poem that Alice Quinn called, did you see the New Yorker excerpt from this book?

14:14.894 --> 14:16.736
The little sonnet she ends with.

14:16.876 --> 14:18.238
That's a revised version.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.900
That's not what the New Yorker printed.

14:20.121 --> 14:26.789
And it's a brilliant, there's something about the self-divided, which is a marvelous theme for her.

14:28.251 --> 14:30.494
But the first version was not that.

14:30.514 --> 14:31.155
I forget what it was.

14:31.912 --> 14:36.359
The word had a rhyme with divided, decided, or something like that.

14:36.379 --> 14:38.382
A creature undecided is the second one.

14:38.402 --> 14:39.384
That's the better one.

14:39.724 --> 14:44.512
Do you feel like, you mentioned that part of her greatness lies in her accessibility, I guess.

14:44.552 --> 14:44.793
I do.

14:45.373 --> 14:46.135
Absolutely.

14:46.655 --> 14:51.303
Do you think that this is a quality that other poets see in her work?

14:51.603 --> 14:54.508
I mean, look at the tribute that she's getting tomorrow evening.

14:54.528 --> 14:55.289
It's true, yes.

14:55.409 --> 14:56.331
What do you think of that?

14:56.511 --> 14:57.733
She's greatly admired her.

14:58.234 --> 14:59.556
I don't know any other...

14:59.620 --> 15:10.751
contemporary poet who doesn't really think she's, you know, she's the poet's poet, and she's not poetic in the old-fashioned sense of that word, you know, posture, anything but.

15:11.432 --> 15:16.337
She's very colloquial, you might have one more so much.

15:17.098 --> 15:18.059
It's natural speech.

15:18.459 --> 15:24.025
And I connect all this to Nova Scotia.

15:24.486 --> 15:27.889
The fact that she grew up on a farm, or at least a rural

15:28.274 --> 15:32.219
in a rural background, very homely people.

15:32.239 --> 15:42.110
I mean, you know, in the old, again, in the old-fashioned sense of, you know, no city-fied artificiality.

15:42.130 --> 15:45.935
So we're building a cow and riding around with him.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.438
And there were demons, there were ghosts that she had.

15:48.478 --> 15:49.259
Yes.

15:49.279 --> 15:55.065
There's one letter where she mentions, I'm now the same age as my father when he died.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.729
You know, that's an awareness, isn't it?

15:57.749 --> 15:58.129
Absolutely.

15:58.413 --> 15:59.194
She had that.

15:59.234 --> 16:00.155
She was ultra-aware.

16:00.175 --> 16:01.477
She wouldn't be the genius she is.

16:01.497 --> 16:08.046
She had that extra sensory perception of whatever it is, seven cents, eight cents.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.929
She had it very well.

16:09.949 --> 16:10.750
And you wouldn't think it.

16:10.790 --> 16:23.908
You know, if you met her and talked to her, it would just be an ordinary conversation, and yet you... How could she write poems as, you know, as brilliant as the one she does, like the moose?

16:23.928 --> 16:26.732
The moose starts out as a bus ride, and then suddenly...

16:27.623 --> 16:30.806
You know, it's all about life, meaning of life.

16:31.626 --> 16:34.849
Very heavy words, not a word she ever uses.

16:34.869 --> 16:41.815
People start falling asleep and then she remembers her grandparents talking in the feather beds.

16:43.016 --> 16:45.158
I don't know how she does it, it's sort of magical.

16:46.339 --> 16:52.024
I've heard it said about writers that I've interviewed over the years.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.906
Maybe it's true, maybe it's not.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.529
Perhaps you as an editor could comment.

16:57.847 --> 17:03.335
Every writer aspires to write a novel, and they say every novelist aspires to be a poet.

17:03.375 --> 17:08.802
I mean, I know certainly that's true without that in many respects.

17:08.822 --> 17:10.905
Do you agree with that?

17:11.045 --> 17:12.808
I think many writers do.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.189
Yes, it is.

17:14.209 --> 17:16.112
It's the height of language.

17:16.352 --> 17:17.554
Why is that, do you think?

17:19.056 --> 17:25.525
Is it just something that human expression, I guess, is... I think so, and it has nothing to do with history, the way...

17:25.943 --> 17:32.129
You know, the arts develop in history, that is to say, you know, if you're a musician, if you don't write a symphony, you're not.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.471
If you're not a musician.

17:35.312 --> 17:35.893
If you're not a musician.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.374
And so on is the most difficult thing.

17:37.975 --> 17:45.001
But there are novelists who don't, I mean, there are minorities who don't aspire in that direction.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.723
They don't ever talk about it.

17:47.724 --> 17:54.010
But I agree with what you say, that it's a goal or a name that's very high.

17:54.445 --> 17:57.830
As an editor, do you enjoy editing poetry?

17:58.130 --> 17:59.713
Oh, yes, I always have.

17:59.733 --> 18:02.777
And I started out with Lowell, you know.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.940
Not a bad one.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.683
That was an accident.

18:06.703 --> 18:10.308
Because, you know, I read poetry in college and so on.

18:10.328 --> 18:14.233
But I was working with Jean Stafford on her first novel, Lost an Adventure.

18:14.274 --> 18:17.979
And she one day said, I'd like you to have lunch with my husband.

18:17.999 --> 18:22.125
And, you know, he's writing poems.

18:22.145 --> 18:24.368
He might have a manuscript to show you.

18:24.584 --> 18:26.025
It was Lord Rory's castle.

18:27.187 --> 18:30.450
So I started out with that.

18:30.650 --> 18:40.119
And I met Eliot, but I can't say I was Eliot's editor, because he already had the Nobel Prize.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.582
I thought I was part of his career.

18:43.602 --> 18:45.204
It's just an accident that I met him.

18:46.065 --> 18:46.786
I'm sorry, who was that?

18:46.986 --> 18:51.730
I'd say it was just an accident that I met him, because he was a friend of Frank Morley, who was my boss.

18:53.012 --> 18:54.093
Did I ever tell you the story?

18:54.133 --> 18:54.473
No.

18:54.773 --> 19:00.721
Listen, right after the war, I got out of the Navy in 46, I guess it was.

19:02.043 --> 19:06.128
And Morley told me, you know, T.S.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.570
Eliot is coming to New York.

19:07.910 --> 19:11.775
This was before he got the Nobel Prize in 48, I guess.

19:12.616 --> 19:13.878
This was 46.

19:14.139 --> 19:22.890
I was, you know, so glad to be back out of the Pacific and back in my office.

19:23.984 --> 19:33.476
And suddenly Morley walked into my office with Elliot and said, Bob, Mr. Elliot wants to take you to lunch.

19:34.457 --> 19:35.378
I don't dream it.

19:35.398 --> 19:40.084
For some mix-up, Elliot had just landed at easy sail.

19:40.124 --> 19:45.331
Then he came into New York, on one of the ocean liners in those days.

19:46.072 --> 19:52.540
And thinking he was going to lunch with Frank Morley, and Morley couldn't do it, so...

19:53.819 --> 19:58.185
I was chosen because I was scared, really, you know.

19:58.205 --> 19:59.828
I thought, what can I say to this man?

20:00.909 --> 20:03.072
I like reading your poems.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.276
And he put me completely easy.

20:05.296 --> 20:07.178
He was very, very, very fine about it.

20:07.218 --> 20:11.825
He said, as one editor to another, do you have much author trouble?

20:14.449 --> 20:16.472
And because I laughed, I had me laugh.

20:17.073 --> 20:18.595
And he laughed and said, listen.

20:18.811 --> 20:20.272
He's very easy to talk to him.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.855
You're probably just a kid if you think, actually.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.196
I was, I was in my 20s.

20:24.677 --> 20:25.377
Well, I was 29.

20:25.397 --> 20:26.398
Oh, that's true.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.080
Yeah, well, that's true.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.062
To be dealing with T.S.

20:30.142 --> 20:31.623
Eliot.

20:32.784 --> 20:33.085
Right.

20:33.105 --> 20:43.555
And, uh, well, I mean, therefore, I was pushed in the direction of poetry just by history, by my autobiography, so to speak.

20:44.516 --> 20:45.797
You've lost a couple of years.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.895
really fine writers in recent years.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.397
I mean, about my very favorite stuff.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.040
I mean, I thought Walter Percy was the finest living.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.242
Yeah, he was a great, great stylist.

20:55.623 --> 20:55.723
Yeah.

20:55.743 --> 20:56.043
Right.

20:56.263 --> 20:59.527
I have everything of his, a first edition signed.

20:59.927 --> 21:05.152
I mean, I just, uh, of course, from Ballamone, uh, was another great thing.

21:05.172 --> 21:06.373
Oh, Barry was a great friend.

21:07.274 --> 21:12.159
And I thought there'd be more posthumous stuff, but I guess that one, that one collection, yes.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.301
And Percy surprised me, too.

21:14.461 --> 21:15.042
I know.

21:15.848 --> 21:18.111
I guess what they had was out there.

21:18.632 --> 21:20.073
Did that surprise you?

21:20.133 --> 21:24.239
I don't mean to jump from one to the other now.

21:24.819 --> 21:25.040
No.

21:25.400 --> 21:31.748
Two other executives with me from Malamud and Malamud helped me to track down all the stuff.

21:32.729 --> 21:38.076
He hadn't finished the last novel, which would have been a very good book, I think.

21:38.258 --> 21:41.381
Very important book, but in a very interesting book.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.222
Any letters there?

21:42.342 --> 21:42.943
Well, there are letters.

21:42.963 --> 21:45.245
They're all done at the, we're thinking of that now.

21:45.406 --> 21:47.388
They're done at the Library of Congress.

21:47.608 --> 21:50.331
Gave all his papers to the Library of Congress.

21:50.351 --> 21:54.595
His son is interested in working on this.

21:54.615 --> 21:58.159
He's called me up a couple of times, so something may come of that.

21:58.179 --> 22:00.001
How about Percy?

22:00.021 --> 22:07.489
Percy has just done one book, what Sam Patrick Samway did, of the essays, and reviews and stuff.

22:08.043 --> 22:11.247
Well, there's a novel, there's an unfinished novel, but I haven't seen it.

22:11.267 --> 22:12.128
Is there?

22:12.148 --> 22:12.969
Well, I don't know.

22:12.989 --> 22:15.252
It's exciting in a way, isn't it?

22:15.373 --> 22:19.198
It is, but I don't know how far it goes, you know.

22:19.738 --> 22:20.900
Yeah, what do you think with me?

22:21.140 --> 22:27.068
I mean, as an editor, again, they brought out that Hemingway novel a couple years ago.

22:27.128 --> 22:27.929
Yeah, I remember that.

22:28.049 --> 22:31.534
Jinx was the chapter of thirds of that.

22:31.634 --> 22:31.914
No.

22:32.335 --> 22:36.320
So you wonder if it was worth doing, or is it Hemingway's work, or is it Jinx's work?

22:36.340 --> 22:37.101
It's terrible.

22:37.121 --> 22:37.982
We really had a lot of...

22:38.333 --> 22:42.817
We had long discussions with Ann and the other executives.

22:42.857 --> 22:49.864
There was Kim Seldes, another writer that's just kind of on my head this minute, and the three of us.

22:49.904 --> 22:57.111
And we really, for a long while, we didn't think we were going to publish the, was it called God's People?

22:57.151 --> 22:58.412
I can't remember that.

22:58.432 --> 23:04.758
And, you know, it was a marvelous concept and theme.

23:04.778 --> 23:06.400
And so we thought it really,

23:07.325 --> 23:13.214
And he left notes about the conclusion so he could get the whole picture.

23:13.694 --> 23:14.576
I'm glad we did it.

23:15.877 --> 23:21.105
You were toying with the idea once, as I recall, of writing a book about nine writers.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.129
First novels, no.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.494
I'm now doing a book just about writers I've known.

23:27.514 --> 23:29.637
That sounds nice.

23:29.657 --> 23:29.938
Yeah.

23:29.998 --> 23:37.028
They keep asking me to write my memoirs, but I get self-conscious and sort of inhibited when I think of that.

23:37.075 --> 23:39.819
you know, memoirs or autobiography.

23:40.259 --> 23:53.037
But I can write about Gene Stafford or Carl Sandburg, who's another poet, and a very different kind of poet from... Who are some of the other writers that you might, that would be in there?

23:53.057 --> 24:06.255
Paul Kerouac, Randall Jarrell, I did all his early poetry, Flannery O'Connor, Walter Percy, Bernard Malamud,

24:06.978 --> 24:13.146
Oh, dozens and dozens, but I'm always going to write about publishers.

24:13.166 --> 24:17.251
I'm going to write about both Mr. Harcourt and Mr. Brace.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.335
Their story has never been told, you know.

24:21.556 --> 24:24.880
I really have an interesting insight into all that.

24:25.101 --> 24:27.063
Well, you were there for quite a few years.

24:27.083 --> 24:30.467
Yeah, I started, and it's hard to think, and it's hard to believe anymore.

24:30.608 --> 24:32.470
I started in 1940.

24:33.691 --> 24:34.993
It's about 50 years.

24:36.307 --> 24:37.388
One of the 94.

24:39.490 --> 24:43.915
Not for the record, but it is kind of exciting to see what's happened to that company.

24:43.935 --> 24:44.415
I know.

24:45.236 --> 24:47.378
And what's that with the publishing?

24:47.398 --> 24:47.498
Yeah.

24:48.119 --> 24:48.940
It's pretty awful.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.823
All these mergers and all that kind of stuff.

24:52.323 --> 24:53.765
Helen Wolfe just died.

24:53.805 --> 24:56.908
She was a very fine editor.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.470
Pantheon, started Pantheon.

24:59.491 --> 25:00.692
I knew her very early.

25:00.772 --> 25:03.335
I knew her husband, Kurt Wolfe.

25:03.515 --> 25:03.715
And

25:04.201 --> 25:04.862
They just don't.

25:04.922 --> 25:06.543
What a useful infant they were.

25:07.084 --> 25:07.184
Yeah.

25:07.765 --> 25:08.605
Beautiful infant.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.648
And now they're just doing other basically random households.

25:12.329 --> 25:14.772
That's right.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.453
That excitement isn't there.

25:16.533 --> 25:26.103
Any other writers that you think of before we... Oh, I have tons of them.

25:26.163 --> 25:26.904
Some of you don't.

25:26.944 --> 25:27.685
No, people don't.

25:27.705 --> 25:30.107
No, I'm not even going to talk about...

25:31.640 --> 25:38.566
Writers who never progressed or never developed one or two cases of that.

25:38.606 --> 25:41.889
Why that happened is very strange, you know.

25:42.670 --> 25:48.495
Almost... And these writers who had published things and just kind of... Yeah, started out, you know.

25:50.737 --> 25:55.101
Well, I think Salinger's a good example.

25:55.801 --> 25:57.943
He stopped writing, what, 30 years ago?

25:58.023 --> 25:59.845
It's astonishing.

25:59.865 --> 26:00.145
Such a...

26:00.665 --> 26:26.048
talented man and in a way you can't explain it it's just do you think he's writing somebody said he had written he had completed seven of them and threw them in the fireplace and i said i don't believe that i think if i did that much work yeah they'd at least make a copy before they threw them that's right you remember when capote died i thought they were going to find all this right

26:26.517 --> 26:34.108
That was a big... Yeah, well, but he had really physically deteriorated some drugs.

26:34.648 --> 26:37.693
He got on tires on one day on television.

26:37.993 --> 26:38.774
I was in a bar.

26:39.355 --> 26:40.977
It felt sad to him.

26:40.997 --> 26:41.999
Yeah.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.501
Shouldn't have done it.

26:43.521 --> 26:47.386
But I mean, that fragment that was left was basically worthless.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.668
Absolutely.

26:48.688 --> 26:51.672
I'm not going to quote you on this.

26:51.812 --> 26:52.373
No, no, but I...

26:53.045 --> 26:55.929
He didn't have the energy and the capacity anymore.

26:56.069 --> 26:58.173
Whatever talent he had had burned out.

26:58.974 --> 27:03.160
These are pretty rare things now, letter collections.

27:03.180 --> 27:03.761
It's true.

27:04.121 --> 27:08.207
And a lot of it is accidental in the fact that she lived in South America.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.970
Everybody she knew was up here.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.714
I mean, there were telephones when most of these were written.

27:12.734 --> 27:12.874
Right.

27:13.595 --> 27:14.757
And she did use the phone.

27:15.598 --> 27:20.385
But I know our earliest friend, Franny Blau,

27:21.783 --> 27:30.311
who lives in New York, and her daughter is the one who designed this book, Cynthia Krupad, is actually Franny's daughter.

27:30.331 --> 27:36.117
And she's a marvelous, marvelous typographer and designer.

27:38.159 --> 27:39.680
And she had saved every letter.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.886
She knew that she said from early, you know, high school days, boarding school, long uphill high school.

27:47.067 --> 27:51.351
She'd not let me say that every letter, every envelope, you know, right from the start.

27:51.803 --> 27:52.404
She knew.

27:52.984 --> 27:53.404
She knew.

27:53.825 --> 27:56.747
She said we all knew Bishop was a genius.

27:56.767 --> 27:59.149
I called him Bishop at boarding school.

28:01.011 --> 28:02.892
And she turned it on.

28:02.912 --> 28:09.818
She had it all filed and boxed, very much appreciated by an editor, you know.

28:09.858 --> 28:16.344
It was all marvelously codified and marked.

28:16.364 --> 28:18.926
And there was a big gap.

28:18.946 --> 28:20.707
And I said, Franny, did I lose something?

28:20.807 --> 28:21.608
It was about

28:22.330 --> 28:23.651
six years in there.

28:24.092 --> 28:28.075
And she said, Bob, that's when Elizabeth moved to New York.

28:29.076 --> 28:31.619
So we're on the phone every day.

28:31.639 --> 28:34.942
She said, well, let her know about this with Elizabeth.

28:35.022 --> 28:36.183
You know, it was like the same time.

28:36.203 --> 28:39.586
But you had other correspondents who picked up the slack in that shape.

28:39.686 --> 28:39.987
Sure.

28:40.147 --> 28:44.931
Are there any people, I mean, I can't believe the variety of people that you wrote to here.

28:45.031 --> 28:48.755
Are there people that you feel are there that you didn't get?

28:48.815 --> 28:48.895
Yes.

28:49.448 --> 28:58.978
I'm sure of it because... Are there any of those that come to mind that you think should be... Well, the one interesting example I'm going to read her letter tomorrow is Miss Pearson.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.359
I don't know if you noticed that letter.

29:00.559 --> 29:01.300
It's a stranger.

29:02.441 --> 29:07.767
I don't know what her name is, except her last name is Pearson.

29:08.928 --> 29:10.249
And the book was in galleys.

29:11.691 --> 29:17.076
And I sent a set to a couple of people for comments.

29:17.096 --> 29:18.578
One of them was James Merrill.

29:19.402 --> 29:23.267
And he said, oh, Bob, I meant the meaning of looking through it.

29:23.287 --> 29:27.954
The book is marvelous, but there's a letter you should see, you know.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.117
And I said, well, where did you get this letter?

29:30.638 --> 29:33.402
He said, it was at Amherst.

29:33.422 --> 29:37.467
They were having an autographing thing in the local bookstore.

29:38.028 --> 29:42.475
And some man came up and said, here's a very interesting letter by Elizabeth Fisher.

29:43.536 --> 29:45.679
And he said, I started to read him.

29:45.895 --> 29:50.823
By the time I wanted to talk to him, he'd disappear.

29:51.504 --> 29:52.546
It was just a copy.

29:52.586 --> 29:53.687
It wasn't the original letter.

29:57.353 --> 30:02.221
But he never got the man's name and never found out how the man got Holden's name.

30:02.241 --> 30:03.523
Well, I put it in the book.

30:03.784 --> 30:12.898
Well, we might get the answer to that.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.925
I really don't want to ask you about the content.

30:17.146 --> 30:20.709
The content is self-explanatory, I guess.

30:20.789 --> 30:22.671
Good evening.

30:24.734 --> 30:29.559
I know you've had a long day, and you get up from New York, so I don't want to take up too much time.

30:29.579 --> 30:30.940
No, that's all right.

30:31.681 --> 30:33.162
It's easy to talk about, I guess.

30:33.763 --> 30:36.546
When Ida told me you were coming, I said, gee, I'd love to talk to you.

30:36.566 --> 30:37.087
Well, I know.

30:37.107 --> 30:38.288
I was delighted to hear that.

30:38.768 --> 30:40.830
I'd be seeing you again, because I remember.

30:40.850 --> 30:43.273
Let me say also, you know, I've done this on tape.

30:43.540 --> 30:52.052
It was more of a chore at the beginning than I expected.

30:52.072 --> 30:53.935
I didn't realize it would be such hard work.

30:55.778 --> 31:01.706
Because previously I edited other people's collections because I had a manuscript.

31:01.726 --> 31:04.590
Putting that manuscript together took me six years.

31:05.732 --> 31:07.655
And, you know, I had a reason.

31:07.675 --> 31:12.602
How can you make a selection unless you read everything first, you know, window it out?

31:13.477 --> 31:41.728
and it took six years and i was i was a little overwhelmed you know the first two years because as i began to get on top of it and i didn't know how to use the word process and i couldn't learn too late for me and i had to use pick away at a typewriter and so on and handwriting was terrible i think it was i think there were only two words you couldn't penetrate i guess right

31:41.928 --> 31:46.553
In the end, but it got better and better.

31:46.593 --> 31:49.657
Then I realized it was going to be a very good book because I was very pleased.

31:50.398 --> 31:54.082
But I had to get over that original difficulty.

31:54.102 --> 31:55.644
There aren't many writings that you've been doing it for.

31:56.005 --> 31:56.265
No.

31:58.507 --> 31:59.048
That's right.

31:59.268 --> 32:00.830
Or worth doing it for.

32:01.231 --> 32:05.496
And it became obvious that it was in her case.

32:05.516 --> 32:06.917
So that's my home address.

32:06.937 --> 32:08.079
I'll put my phone down, too.

32:08.099 --> 32:10.922
If you don't mind, I'm just going to use it.

32:11.476 --> 32:15.420
Well, my thing, you never know.

32:15.440 --> 32:23.749
I've got to think.

32:23.849 --> 32:26.271
Were there any great surprises for you here?

32:27.773 --> 32:32.898
Yes, I didn't really know the whole story about the suicide.

32:32.998 --> 32:36.322
I heard very wrong versions of it.

32:37.603 --> 32:39.525
There was the one with Maria Osa.

32:40.366 --> 32:55.201
She had sent me a couple of letters, and she said, of course, I can't send you all the letters that I have, because, you know, it's all... Perhaps too... She didn't use the word scandalous, but that's what she meant.

32:56.182 --> 33:01.348
And I said, look, I have everything, got everything, and you mustn't hold back.

33:01.368 --> 33:02.649
This is posterity.

33:03.230 --> 33:04.371
We have to know about it.

33:05.692 --> 33:09.276
So she sent me the most personal letters.

33:09.931 --> 33:15.399
And then there were a couple from Lauren McIver, who is a painter, still living.

33:15.419 --> 33:17.282
She's in her 80s.

33:17.342 --> 33:18.523
Very interesting woman.

33:18.543 --> 33:23.410
She was married to Lloyd Frankenberg, who was a poet, who killed himself.

33:23.431 --> 33:26.094
I knew Lloyd years ago.

33:27.556 --> 33:30.521
And she had several letters.

33:30.561 --> 33:32.784
She said, I don't know whether I can give you these, Bob.

33:32.804 --> 33:35.748
And I said, why can't you give them to me?

33:36.369 --> 33:38.993
And she said, well, as you'll see at the end, Elizabeth says,

33:39.631 --> 33:43.095
destroy these letters or please burn these letters.

33:43.115 --> 33:45.298
And I said, but Lauren, you haven't.

33:45.318 --> 33:47.120
You haven't.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.002
So they're now, you know, they're extant.

33:49.062 --> 33:49.963
They're part of history.

33:49.983 --> 33:52.646
It's like Kafka directing that everything be destroyed.

33:52.707 --> 33:54.128
Absolutely.

33:54.609 --> 34:00.956
Well, those were the two extremist examples.

34:00.976 --> 34:02.218
One other quick question.

34:02.238 --> 34:06.223
You do mention that you feel that she's actually worth a multi-volume letter.

34:06.243 --> 34:06.583
Yes, I do.

34:07.829 --> 34:08.730
How about this?

34:09.591 --> 34:17.079
Well, I think so, because a lot of them are about poetry.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.723
I couldn't use all the letters I wanted to because it becomes too technical.

34:21.244 --> 34:31.815
Looking at all her letters to Lowell and her letters to Marion Moore, and other poets who corresponded with it, she was very critical.

34:31.896 --> 34:37.802
She had a marvelous faculty of not kidding, you know, she's a

34:38.153 --> 34:39.374
I'm going to be very critical.

34:39.474 --> 34:43.339
If you don't like criticism, I won't write you at all.

34:44.099 --> 34:46.802
And of course, there's nothing personal in this.

34:46.822 --> 34:50.226
I'm just telling you how it strikes me, and I'll be very honest with you.

34:51.007 --> 34:51.968
She did it to Loa.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.070
It's astonishing.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.752
I don't know what you're lying for.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.194
What are you trying to say?

34:57.214 --> 34:58.495
Do you think she's been a good editor?

34:58.755 --> 34:58.975
Yes.

34:59.636 --> 35:00.877
On poetry, especially.

35:01.458 --> 35:04.161
But I think I'm going on anything, because...

35:04.715 --> 35:06.137
She was so meticulous.

35:06.397 --> 35:08.561
She was just demanding.

35:09.101 --> 35:16.231
Yeah, I remember when I wrote a packet copy, a flop copy, you know, for her first book of hers I worked on, which is Ellen Amor.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.635
She tore it apart.

35:18.655 --> 35:25.224
And I was like, I've been slightly lazy, and I just couldn't get by her.

35:25.304 --> 35:29.170
I love the letters where she's telling me the color cloth that she was.

35:29.504 --> 35:41.435
You did a wonderful, I mean, I do things like look at the cloth.

35:41.495 --> 35:42.576
Oh, I love it.

35:42.636 --> 35:43.497
That's Cynthia.

35:43.577 --> 35:45.939
Isn't that colorful?

35:46.120 --> 35:47.381
Isn't that great?

35:47.781 --> 35:50.624
It's such one of the handsomest findings.

35:50.704 --> 35:54.327
I love the jacket, but I'd like to put it on my shelf without it.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.270
Yeah, you could do both.

35:57.370 --> 35:58.071
Thanks, Nick.

35:58.091 --> 35:58.431
Thank you.
