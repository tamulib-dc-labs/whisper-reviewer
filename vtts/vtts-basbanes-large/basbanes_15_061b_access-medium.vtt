A nice picture.

00:13.598 --> 00:17.143
Hold my pen.

00:21.891 --> 00:30.223

I'll show you an album.

00:41.159 --> 00:44.904
Don't be surprised if this doesn't work its way into the story.

00:45.025 --> 00:47.728
I'll show you an album that I keep.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.794

This is a visit to Finland.

01:17.890 --> 01:29.961
This is a meeting with the foreign minister of Finland, with the president of Finland, with the health minister of Finland, all in 18 hours, and talking to them about satellites.

01:30.312 --> 01:32.314
And I have a lot of it.

01:32.334 --> 01:33.876
It's like a diary.

01:34.156 --> 01:38.241
S-A-T-E-L, capital L-I-F-E, one word.

01:38.401 --> 01:39.062
Right.

01:39.082 --> 01:40.183
Exactly.

01:40.323 --> 01:41.084

Cartoons.

A couple of headlines.

01:54.159 --> 01:56.622
Yeah, cartoons and happenings.

Nuclear testing is the heart of my family.

02:00.772 --> 02:06.721
And here, President Rabin is not a ploy, but he's predicting his own death.

02:07.102 --> 02:07.542
Great.

02:08.524 --> 02:10.166
And here— Interesting, isn't it?

02:10.186 --> 02:10.567
Yeah.

02:11.008 --> 02:14.112
Here's things, a visit to Holland.

02:15.154 --> 02:17.938
And I always go to art museums to Vermeer.

02:18.179 --> 02:28.154
And I get the art of the— This is the Mauritius Museum, and— The famous Rembrandt painting of the Anatomy Lesson.

02:28.334 --> 02:28.855
Prado.

02:29.290 --> 02:32.314
They're lecturing in Prada, and they're staying in a monastery.

02:32.715 --> 02:35.579
So, you don't have any Thomas Bacon paintings there?

02:35.599 --> 02:36.580
I have Thomas Bacon.

02:36.601 --> 02:37.261
Yeah, I do.

02:37.302 --> 02:40.306
And this is Prada, and this is The Glories of Lawn.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.027
Oh, this is wonderful.

02:41.047 --> 02:42.569

02:43.030 --> 02:43.631
Look.

02:54.713 --> 02:55.854
These are on your shots?

02:55.874 --> 02:56.715
Yeah.

02:56.835 --> 02:57.576
Wow.

02:57.596 --> 03:02.121
And these are lecturing to 1,500 high school students in Italy.

03:03.763 --> 03:10.330
And this is Ben Bellum, the president of Algiers, the first one who was 25 years in jail.

03:11.471 --> 03:18.298
And then here is just a student of mine in Italy, just a well-known author.

03:18.532 --> 03:23.440
This is beautiful.

03:24.822 --> 03:35.860
Art, and shopping in Provence, and cartoons from the nation in Cheney to win the Nobel, see?

03:36.742 --> 03:38.785
And here's my—you see?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.095
A major achievement of 1995.

03:41.675 --> 03:44.239
What I told you is the numbering of this book.

03:44.299 --> 03:47.082
The doctor was showing us the photograph of this book.

03:47.323 --> 03:48.044
Yeah.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.546
Yeah.

03:49.846 --> 03:51.789
So it's kind of an interesting thing.

03:51.809 --> 03:52.349
Wait a minute.

03:52.389 --> 03:53.791
What happens, I'll show you.

03:55.053 --> 03:58.778
Here's Howard Zinn, you know, historian.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.902
And this is satellite board meeting.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.910
This is Jerry Rubin, the president of the American Publishers Association.

04:07.950 --> 04:08.991
He's a member of my board.

04:10.034 --> 04:13.140
Maybe you print up these little capsules.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.704
Yeah, I do that myself.

04:15.865 --> 04:16.706
I can see.

04:16.746 --> 04:25.843
This is Ken Galbraith attending the Saga, a celebration of the satellite.

04:25.863 --> 04:28.448
You take people to the symphony.

04:28.548 --> 04:29.389
That was in 95.

04:29.690 --> 04:32.515
Yeah, this is ten years of the Nobel Prize.

04:32.714 --> 04:37.342
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.

This we're celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Nobel Prize.

04:41.610 --> 04:42.832
And these are friends.

04:43.453 --> 04:46.338
This is another, Bill Hinton, a great writer.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.622
Oh, this, you know.

04:49.244 --> 04:50.125
Alan Ginsberg.

04:50.426 --> 04:54.092
I think he was in meditation, you know.

04:54.112 --> 04:57.338
And these are my grandchildren.

04:57.470 --> 05:05.801
Every new year, what I do is take all the stamps I received that year, the stamps, and lay them out in patterns.

05:07.263 --> 05:12.110
Seven, five, and these are the people who were my friends.

05:12.411 --> 05:19.200
Everybody who sent me a card, you cut out their name and their return address, and this goes on.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.243
How many albums do you have like this?

05:21.263 --> 05:22.304
This is number 60.

05:22.324 --> 05:23.646
60?

05:23.947 --> 05:24.608
Sixty.

05:24.828 --> 05:26.449
And how long have you been doing this?

05:26.609 --> 05:27.370
Since 1958.

05:27.550 --> 05:28.691
Oh, that's great.

05:29.992 --> 05:30.433
Sixty.

05:30.813 --> 05:33.716
There are thousands of photographs.

05:33.796 --> 05:34.817
Is this a hobby or anything?

05:34.837 --> 05:35.938
Yeah, it's a hobby.

05:36.859 --> 05:40.422
This is my daughter, Anne, from New York.

05:41.323 --> 05:42.404
These are cartoons.

05:42.424 --> 05:44.646
They basically document everything.

05:44.666 --> 05:44.786
Yeah.

05:45.607 --> 05:48.389
The Dean of Harvard.

05:48.409 --> 05:50.671
And who pastes all of these in?

05:50.691 --> 05:51.592
I do.

05:51.612 --> 05:51.852
I do.

05:52.153 --> 05:53.194
Everything here.

05:53.334 --> 05:53.734
I do.

05:54.592 --> 06:00.038
Here's Alan Guinness with my staff.

06:00.058 --> 06:03.682
Houghton Mifflin is going to publish my book, so they first appear.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.324
And here's a copy of the letter.

06:05.624 --> 06:05.925
Yeah.

06:06.705 --> 06:10.309
And here's my daughter with a birthday party.

06:10.770 --> 06:11.611
See the cartoon?

06:11.971 --> 06:12.412
Marvelous?

06:13.593 --> 06:14.534
And it goes on.

06:14.594 --> 06:15.695
Disneyland.

06:15.715 --> 06:16.737
This is lovely.

06:21.282 --> 06:21.482
Let's see.

06:21.502 --> 06:24.345
Boston Marathon, it ends on.

06:24.764 --> 06:27.106
It ends on the Boston Marathon, and all these.

06:27.967 --> 06:28.588
How come?

06:28.608 --> 06:29.229
Did you ever run it?

06:29.669 --> 06:33.393
No, but every year we watch it outside of our home.

06:33.413 --> 06:34.474
Oh, of course it goes right by here.

06:34.554 --> 06:34.914
Yeah.

06:35.795 --> 06:42.442
So this was a hobby, and this is a retaining memory.

06:42.743 --> 06:46.186
The big struggle in the life is to sustain memory.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.928
I'm going to have a chapter in my new book.

06:48.128 --> 06:51.852
Yeah.

06:53.063 --> 06:54.086
Any other questions?

06:54.126 --> 06:55.491
I think we've covered a lot.

06:55.611 --> 06:55.992
Yeah.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.580
About lots of stuff.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.607
And I have your phone number if I have to.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.550
Right, right, right.

07:01.610 --> 07:03.015
I don't think that'll be necessary.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.038
And this will.

07:04.098 --> 07:04.880
I do write.

07:04.900 --> 07:05.402
Yeah.
