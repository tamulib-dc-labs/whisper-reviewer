00:04.199 --> 00:05.100
I can do Jim Carroll.

00:05.140 --> 00:05.881
Don't even think about it.

00:05.921 --> 00:06.281
It's there.

00:06.401 --> 00:06.981
It'll pick up.

00:08.263 --> 00:08.363
Okay.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.684
Congratulations on the book.

00:12.006 --> 00:15.869
And tell me Requiem, an American Requiem.

00:15.889 --> 00:18.932
Explain the title for me, the choice of title.

00:18.952 --> 00:22.075
Well, let's put this closer.

00:22.195 --> 00:22.435
All right.

00:24.237 --> 00:33.345
You know, I think actually I was maybe inspired by that Brahms, a German Requiem.

00:33.848 --> 00:35.510
which is, of course, a great piece of music.

00:35.990 --> 00:44.779
Requiem appealed to me because it's not just a funeral mass, a requiem.

00:47.422 --> 00:52.727
There's a connotation in the ritual event of a requiem, that it's kind of the end of something.

00:54.829 --> 00:59.434
You have a requiem at the end of the war, the war requiem, Benjamin Britten.

01:00.528 --> 01:15.325
But what I really love about the word, so for me, there is very much the end of something here, and there's the connotations that I especially value in that word, requiem, are, well, it means in Latin to rest, requiescat in pace.

01:15.365 --> 01:21.692
We call a requiem a requiem because the first words of the ritual are requiescat in pace, rest in peace.

01:21.712 --> 01:26.378
So there's this idea of laying to rest, laying to rest someone.

01:27.319 --> 01:28.240
My father literally

01:29.317 --> 01:31.419
The story begins and ends with a Mass.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.722
It begins with my first Mass, ends with my Father's funeral Mass.

01:36.844 --> 01:38.445
So there's this connotation of rest.

01:38.505 --> 01:47.974
But also for me, I value the connotation of prayer, that it is a kind of handing over.

01:48.595 --> 01:53.479
For me, prayer is handing over to God the things we can't carry by ourselves.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.564
And in this case, I feel like I'm handing over to whoever reads the book.

02:00.012 --> 02:03.337
what I couldn't carry by myself.

02:04.518 --> 02:08.063
Is this your first work on nonfiction?

02:08.083 --> 02:08.544
Not really.

02:10.326 --> 02:18.217
Of course, it came to me through the nonfiction work I do for the Globe as a columnist.

02:18.558 --> 02:25.227
Well, when I was a priest, I published a number of books, which are happily long since out of print.

02:26.329 --> 02:27.370
And I didn't...

02:28.447 --> 02:38.819
I say happily because, not that I would repudiate the sensibility of those books, but I didn't apply the proper standard of writing to them, so they're not well written.

02:40.120 --> 02:48.510
But I wrote as a priest in a non-fiction voice, works of popular theology and politics, writing about the war and so forth.

02:48.770 --> 02:51.754
No, this is my first work in non-fiction, yes.

02:52.414 --> 02:55.618
So it's my tenth book, the first nine of which were novels.

02:56.273 --> 03:01.179
And one of which you point out towards the end of the memoir.

03:01.199 --> 03:03.362
By the way, do you think of it as a memoir?

03:03.382 --> 03:07.827
Well, the word I used to myself about it was a personal history.

03:09.349 --> 03:10.450
But I suppose it is a memoir.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.712
I'm not sure what the distinction is.

03:12.332 --> 03:22.585
You point out that the family trade was more or less written as an attempt at rapprochement with the Asada.

03:24.107 --> 03:25.268
At first it succeeded.

03:25.687 --> 03:29.972
And then you read some piece in the Washington Post, a ballistic line.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.155
Right.

03:32.175 --> 03:46.191
But did you have it in your mind all along that you might be attempting, trying, resolving this schism, I guess, to what you do for it?

03:46.211 --> 03:53.179
Well, I knew, you know, years and years and years ago, I knew that my family...

03:53.530 --> 03:57.095
was embarked on a fantastic story.

03:58.416 --> 04:18.222
I mean, the coincidence, you know, the story of my father's young life and his romance with my mother and his career, I knew that was, and then my brother's polio and the curse of that, and then, of course, everything coming to a terrible climax in Vietnam.

04:18.758 --> 04:24.507
But even there, you know, looking around one day, realizing one day I have one brother in FBI and another brother is a fugitive.

04:25.709 --> 04:28.393
I'm sort of secretly an opponent of the war.

04:28.453 --> 04:33.862
I mean, and the old man is helping to pick targets.

04:35.785 --> 04:37.287
I'm thinking, shit, what is this, a movie?

04:37.307 --> 04:38.329
You know?

04:38.349 --> 04:39.130
I mean, it's a story.

04:39.190 --> 04:43.036
And then as you find out later, he has problems with it.

04:43.056 --> 04:46.622
And he had his own story going on that I wasn't privy to.

04:47.429 --> 04:49.131
Right, which was about the bomb.

04:49.212 --> 04:51.375
Which caused him extraordinary anguish.

04:51.475 --> 04:52.256
Right, right.

04:52.276 --> 05:01.189
I mean, if you recall that, that one moment where, I forget, he's playing golf in Puerto Rico, and he said, the bomb, you know, make weapons that we don't use.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.472
Right, right, right.

05:03.492 --> 05:03.853
And I opened it.

05:03.873 --> 05:05.074
Right, it is.

05:06.276 --> 05:13.226
And there are these moments through my life that I, as a fiction writer, would never be able to invent.

05:13.266 --> 05:14.668
That moment I report, uh,

05:16.977 --> 05:25.646
My father, you know, telling me to get ready to take my brothers and my mother south for when the bomb was dropped.

05:26.247 --> 05:42.103
I mean, you know, I remember at the time, I wasn't a storyteller at the time, but I remember at the time knowing very well that I would never forget this, and that this would be a moment that I would always return to, so.

05:42.123 --> 05:46.748
But you could almost see there the novel still being taken.

05:46.913 --> 05:52.341
even long before you knew you would be alone.

05:52.361 --> 06:00.013
Remembering that little telling detail of that side of the newspaper.

06:00.033 --> 06:00.934
Oh, the newspaper, yeah.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.957
The temptation would have been.

06:02.977 --> 06:03.458
Right, right.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.422
Who the hell do you think you're talking through?

06:06.442 --> 06:08.065
You know, that's fine, he's right.

06:08.225 --> 06:10.148
I'm here delivering papers to his kids.

06:10.168 --> 06:11.470
But remember the significance of that.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.133
many, many years later.

06:13.274 --> 06:15.576
I didn't keep notes of any of these things.

06:15.596 --> 06:20.161
I did a piece on Toby Wolfe a couple of years ago.

06:20.221 --> 06:23.044
He published his memoir.

06:25.106 --> 06:29.231
Unlike so many others who have written about these years, he didn't keep a single note.

06:30.232 --> 06:35.278
And he said, what's important to me is what comes up to the prism of memory.

06:35.378 --> 06:39.762
And I wonder if a similar kind of situation would be true.

06:39.983 --> 06:40.343
It's true.

06:40.846 --> 06:42.628
It's true, and I trust the memory.

06:42.828 --> 06:44.791
And what's important is what you remember.

06:44.811 --> 06:46.053
What's important is what you remember.

06:46.073 --> 06:59.449
Although there are things you forget that... I mean, one of the things I experienced in the writing of this book was the thrill of remembering, because there were things that I didn't remember until I was actually tracking what happened.

06:59.710 --> 07:03.254
And then I'd remember, oh my God, that's right.

07:04.516 --> 07:07.039
You know, remembering the disputes in my...

07:07.205 --> 07:14.753
the distinction between the disputes in my family between the war and over Martin Luther King, for example.

07:14.813 --> 07:21.279
I mean, before I started to work on the book, it all blurred, just remembering this kind of general discord.

07:23.161 --> 07:32.410
But then when I started to take it apart and remembered, you know, that, well, my father and I were like this over Martin Luther King before I had a second thought about the war.

07:33.591 --> 07:36.334
Because who had a second thought about the war in 65?

07:37.411 --> 07:44.582
I remember I graduated college in 65, and it was really just asserting itself.

07:44.602 --> 07:51.013
The question was, how are you going to keep the Germans now?

07:51.033 --> 07:54.679
You know, the moral break.

07:54.699 --> 07:57.383
I mean, the divisions, they were starting there.

07:57.403 --> 07:57.623
Yeah.

07:58.605 --> 08:04.414
But there was already this huge gulf opening in our society over the Civil Rights Movement.

08:05.423 --> 08:16.013
And so from the pleasure, there was a kind of recovery of something important when I remembered that, that's right, there were two movements here that followed each other.

08:16.054 --> 08:34.772
And so the writing of it was reclaiming a lot of things that I hadn't been in touch with.

08:34.921 --> 08:37.024
Not this... Right.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.266
Not this direct story.

08:39.286 --> 08:52.042
And I knew that when he died, and as I explained, my father died, you know, right in the height of the Persian Gulf War, which struck me as, you know, novel.

08:52.062 --> 09:04.017
I'm thinking, well, I just obviously someday I'm going to have to write this, you know, and what it was to be in Arlington Cemetery with these armed men.

09:04.553 --> 09:10.681
firing weapons while across the river people are marshalling for a peace demonstration.

09:14.847 --> 09:24.300
It was, well, I mean, I constantly have the experience of, I feel in a sense like I'm going to break with the

09:25.613 --> 09:30.980
the weight of an event like that, and I had that feeling through a lot of this story.

09:31.942 --> 09:40.934
Did you approach it professionally as a writer, which you obviously did, but I mean, you don't see it as a form of exorcism?

09:40.954 --> 09:54.912
No, I'm finishing a story, and I mean, at one level, I feel a certain embarrassment and humility about it because I'm 53 years old, and I could imagine someone saying in reaction to this story, well, he's finally come to terms with his father.

09:54.953 --> 09:55.333
Welcome.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.975
Welcome to the life of an adult.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.097
I mean, that's at one level.

10:00.617 --> 10:03.941
Well, I would understand it.

10:04.001 --> 10:13.570
I mean, it's taken me my life to now to, in a sense, lay to rest, as I said, my youthful struggle with my father.

10:14.191 --> 10:23.920
And so I wouldn't use the word exorcism particularly, but it certainly is a laying to rest.

10:24.828 --> 10:37.345
Well, you know, I think I was finishing this last year when Robert McNamara's book was published.

10:40.089 --> 10:40.410
I did.

10:40.850 --> 10:52.827
And I was aware, vividly aware, that McNamara's book demonstrated very powerfully that this nation has yet to lay this business to rest.

10:54.713 --> 10:59.019
And it isn't just, quote, my generation, unquote.

10:59.039 --> 11:00.962
I mean, there's my parents' generation, too.

11:02.464 --> 11:15.722
The fact is that experience that we, that welter of experiences that we capture in that one word, Vietnam, is business we just haven't finished with as a people.

11:15.982 --> 11:22.932
And so to an extent, this book finishes a large piece of it for me, although

11:23.283 --> 11:26.069
I'm sure in other ways there are other things that are unfinished.

11:26.089 --> 11:29.496
When you were at Georgetown, you were at ROTC, you were cadet of the year.

11:29.516 --> 11:30.939
I was cadet of the year.

11:30.959 --> 11:35.048
Thanks to point out probably to your father's position.

11:35.489 --> 11:39.958
But in any case, had you not decided to go as a poet,

11:40.681 --> 11:42.383
Do you think you would have gone forward?

11:42.403 --> 11:42.764
Oh, sure.

11:42.844 --> 11:45.167
And have sought out a career to become a flyboy?

11:45.227 --> 11:47.671
Yeah, well, I would have graduated from college in 64.

11:47.931 --> 11:50.314
I'd have gotten my commissioners.

11:50.495 --> 11:51.396
You'd have not fully an obligation, actually.

11:51.496 --> 11:56.343
I'd have gone into flight school, and I would have gone to Vietnam.

11:56.643 --> 12:06.697
And that class of flyers who went to Vietnam were the ones who were, by an overwhelming ratio, shot down.

12:07.779 --> 12:09.962
When we're done, I'll tell you my own parallel experience.

12:10.398 --> 12:11.620
Well, I'd like to hear it.

12:12.581 --> 12:22.395
But I've often thought that my other experience could well have been, instead of seven years on ice in a seminary, I could have been seven years on ice in a North Vietnamese prison camp.

12:22.495 --> 12:24.117
I think what I'm exploring is the what if.

12:24.137 --> 12:25.279
Yeah, right.

12:25.299 --> 12:29.244
And it seems apparent that you really didn't want to be a priest.

12:29.264 --> 12:40.320
I mean, there may have been an internal struggle, but it seems to me that you felt the origins of, I mean, you enjoyed appreciating the nice

12:41.195 --> 12:52.067
You'd much rather become a typical American male.

12:52.147 --> 12:57.613
It seems to me that that's what you would have preferred for yourself after that, correct?

12:58.033 --> 13:01.797
Well, I was a divided young fellow, and that's certainly true.

13:02.117 --> 13:10.206
There was this piece of me that wanted a girl, wanted the world, wanted a world of success, wanted to fly airplanes, wanted all of that.

13:11.249 --> 13:18.558
The truth is, there was this other piece of me, which still is, for want of a better word, religious.

13:20.100 --> 13:25.487
And the felt presence of God is a very powerful experience.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.814
And that's what enabled me to do what I did.

13:30.854 --> 13:34.839
You know, it wasn't just all those years of pretending something.

13:34.899 --> 13:38.343
I miscommunicated that that's the impression I left you with.

13:39.325 --> 13:40.446
There was something deeply...

13:40.763 --> 13:50.431
consoling to me in feeling close to God, which I learned to do by going to the seminary.

13:50.651 --> 14:01.480
Yeah, but there was this somewhat epiphanous moment, which was also a moment of weakness, when your father was telling me something, when he said, I wanted to be a priest.

14:01.981 --> 14:02.942
Right, right.

14:02.962 --> 14:04.463
And then I was stuck with having said it.

14:04.483 --> 14:06.024
That was the point of no reason.

14:06.044 --> 14:07.606
Right, right.

14:07.626 --> 14:10.568
And I said that in relationship to my father's showing me

14:11.003 --> 14:12.305
his deep humanity.

14:12.385 --> 14:16.851
Giving you a side of himself that he'd never done before and I don't think ever did again.

14:16.991 --> 14:17.232
Right.

14:17.852 --> 14:18.694
Right.

14:18.714 --> 14:19.334
Not verbally.

14:19.595 --> 14:23.180
And in response to that, you committed yourself to something.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.503
Had you not committed yourself at that moment, you wouldn't have... Right.

14:25.683 --> 14:26.845
No, I probably wouldn't have.

14:27.085 --> 14:35.497
In fact, and then a couple of years later, as I say somewhere in there, I could have fulfilled the same impulse by going to the Peace Corps, which wasn't an option in 1960.

14:35.517 --> 14:35.977
That's right.

14:36.698 --> 14:37.559
But by 63, it was.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.622
It was, yeah.

14:39.642 --> 14:40.183
And...

14:41.851 --> 14:55.183
That impulse, that is, to be of service, to do good, to be virtuous, the opposite impulse from being a warrior, being a man of power, a man of ambition.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.309
So you take what you get.

15:01.349 --> 15:11.318
Of course, I was also unconsciously playing out the drama of my father and mother's unfinished business with his own vocation, which I wasn't particularly conscious of.

15:11.416 --> 15:14.379
And that really does... Shave me.

15:14.399 --> 15:16.982
That goes a lot deeper, doesn't it?

15:17.102 --> 15:18.424
It does, yes.

15:18.444 --> 15:21.227
That other scene, you talk about the telling scene.

15:21.747 --> 15:28.775
I could think of a moment for my own youth playing baseball, you know, and whacking one.

15:30.276 --> 15:31.698
And my father happened to be there.

15:31.918 --> 15:34.061
What a moment back then.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.343
I was never a great athlete like this.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.342
You had a moment.

15:38.742 --> 15:41.025
It was a wonderful, wonderful moment.

15:41.046 --> 15:42.908
And then when you repeated it, he was gone.

15:43.228 --> 15:44.370
Right, right.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.493
Because in your view... What did you make of it?

15:47.254 --> 15:48.796
I mean, I think I say what I made of it.

15:48.936 --> 15:49.677
It was wonderful.

15:49.697 --> 15:52.641
But I mean, he saw something he didn't like.

15:52.681 --> 15:56.766
He didn't like because you were going in a direction that he didn't really want to go in.

15:56.866 --> 15:57.127
Right.

15:58.408 --> 15:59.350
It was asserting yourself.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.772
Right.

16:00.792 --> 16:05.638
In a way that was counter to what maybe he wanted for himself, which might even be

16:05.838 --> 16:34.815
a form of redemption for himself you think he was seeking a form of redemption through you i think he was yeah i mean that's the way in which parents do i think uh it's a misguided impulse like parents have but yeah you see and one thing we have any by the way just look a few of those real beliefs right right the red light is on the red light is on right mike i don't have my glasses yeah it's turning yeah that's fine um

16:37.090 --> 16:47.445
I think all these votes, you know, that I've hardly ever used them.

16:47.565 --> 16:59.562
One thing we haven't even touched on yet, which I really love about the book, you know, is we really do give a feel for the Irish-American experience of our generation.

17:01.005 --> 17:03.348
You know, it's the second or third generation.

17:03.448 --> 17:06.152
We haven't had the popular impact, the influence.

17:06.385 --> 17:09.848
as strong and as pervasive as it was if they were first generation.

17:09.868 --> 17:10.969
Yes, it's true.

17:10.989 --> 17:21.920
And, you know, from somebody who's almost precisely my own age, you know, and you throw things at me that, I'd forgotten about Bishop Fulton Sheen, but I remember watching him on television.

17:21.940 --> 17:22.060
Right.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.102
Hard-ass crew, he was something.

17:24.322 --> 17:25.223
Right, he was.

17:25.263 --> 17:29.367
I'm not Catholic, you know, but... Or Spelman.

17:30.067 --> 17:32.510
Spelman, Spelman, I didn't know about it.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.311
I mean, that was kind of asking.

17:34.732 --> 17:35.953
That's enough to mention that some of you

17:36.068 --> 17:42.819
His biographer asserts that, asserts that there are those rumors about it.

17:45.624 --> 17:46.806
But how times have changed.

17:47.046 --> 17:47.808
Yeah, it's true.

17:47.828 --> 17:52.095
When I was a reporter before I became a book editor, I was the person responsible.

17:52.115 --> 17:54.860
Remember Father Fredette?

17:54.900 --> 17:55.521
Yes, yes.

17:55.561 --> 17:57.284
I don't know why he chased him off to Canada.

17:57.304 --> 18:01.671
I'm the one who wrote the stories that exposed what he had been doing.

18:01.702 --> 18:02.803
That's the beginning of that.

18:03.023 --> 18:04.865
And the church got him the hell out of town.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.547
And the diocese.

18:07.567 --> 18:11.330
And they were angry, like, who's making these charges?

18:11.350 --> 18:16.254
It's like some kid with a problem was trying to blackmail a priest.

18:16.274 --> 18:18.937
And they really allowed him to get out, and they wouldn't go after him.

18:18.957 --> 18:22.680
And so 20 years later, he's doing this, you know, it all comes back.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.721
He's in jail now.

18:24.741 --> 18:25.402
He came back.

18:25.542 --> 18:31.287
But the feeling about this kind of behavior then was,

18:31.807 --> 18:33.408
Give me a break.

18:33.629 --> 18:34.289
It's not true.

18:34.309 --> 18:35.170
You're libeling.

18:35.190 --> 18:35.910
You're slandering.

18:36.131 --> 18:38.433
You're infaming these men of God.

18:38.613 --> 18:56.248
It's one of the most shocking things Catholics of my generation have to confront, which is that the most outrageous slurs, anti-Catholic, know-nothing, nativist slurs against priests, in some cases, turn out to be true.

18:56.308 --> 18:57.689
It's a very shocking thing.

18:57.729 --> 19:00.151
It's a skull leader, too.

19:00.251 --> 19:01.392
John Paul Casey does that, you know.

19:01.861 --> 19:03.763
I mean, they go where they go.

19:04.344 --> 19:08.809
I don't want to get into that.

19:08.829 --> 19:11.232
But you really do get the texture.

19:11.352 --> 19:20.062
I mean, for your mother, for instance, seeing you tell a man of the cloth was one of the great validations.

19:20.242 --> 19:20.582
It was.

19:21.263 --> 19:21.603
It was.

19:21.984 --> 19:24.447
There's a special place in heaven for the mother of a priest.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.207
Is that right?

19:25.668 --> 19:29.252
So it's the myth, right?

19:29.587 --> 19:44.763
And as you remember, when I told them that they're, told my parents that I'm leaving the priesthood and my mother gets up and leaves the table and goes upstairs, I remember thinking, what is the place in heaven for the mother of the next priest?

19:46.224 --> 19:46.805
Heartbreaking.

19:47.265 --> 19:51.430
Had it not been for the war, let's say, you know, you all need what ifs.

19:52.831 --> 19:56.495
But let's say, you also say, because then you love being a priest.

19:56.515 --> 19:59.458
And you'll have to address yourself to that and I'll follow up where I want to go around.

20:00.535 --> 20:02.818
Well, I think maybe we should point out you didn't leave the priesthood.

20:02.838 --> 20:05.061
I don't know if that's the correct word.

20:05.081 --> 20:05.962
Well, I didn't leave the church.

20:05.982 --> 20:06.523
I did leave the priesthood.

20:06.543 --> 20:07.544
You didn't leave the church.

20:07.564 --> 20:08.926
You didn't leave the church.

20:08.946 --> 20:09.827
You didn't leave the church.

20:09.847 --> 20:10.788
You didn't leave the church.

20:10.829 --> 20:11.870
You didn't leave the church.

20:11.890 --> 20:12.591
You didn't leave the church.

20:12.611 --> 20:13.532
You didn't leave the church.

20:13.672 --> 20:14.874
You didn't leave the church.

20:14.894 --> 20:16.035
You didn't leave the church.

20:16.656 --> 20:17.237
You didn't leave the church.

20:17.257 --> 20:17.918
You didn't leave the church.

20:17.938 --> 20:18.579
You didn't leave the church.

20:18.619 --> 20:19.320
You didn't leave the church.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.121
You didn't leave the church.

20:20.141 --> 20:20.681
I didn't leave the church.

20:20.701 --> 20:21.923
I didn't leave the church.

20:21.943 --> 20:22.544
I didn't leave the church.

20:22.564 --> 20:23.225
I didn't leave the church.

20:23.245 --> 20:24.066
I didn't leave the church.

20:24.086 --> 20:24.747
I didn't leave the church.

20:24.767 --> 20:25.948
I didn't leave the church.

20:25.968 --> 20:26.489
I didn't leave the church.

20:26.509 --> 20:27.070
I didn't leave the church.

20:27.090 --> 20:28.572
I didn't leave the church.

20:28.592 --> 20:29.113
I didn't leave the church.

20:29.133 --> 20:29.513
I didn't leave the

20:29.780 --> 20:32.724
This is not a man who in any way has lost his faith.

20:32.744 --> 20:33.044
Right.

20:33.705 --> 20:34.105
Right.

20:34.205 --> 20:35.066
It's true.

20:35.086 --> 20:39.372
So if it hadn't been, if the war hadn't developed and you were here, do you think it would have remained?

20:40.593 --> 20:41.875
Well, perhaps I would have.

20:41.895 --> 20:45.639
I mean, it's impossible to know.

20:45.699 --> 20:57.053
I think that the culture of hierarchy was so deeply ingrained in me that it almost would have taken something like a war to blow it apart.

20:57.775 --> 21:01.860
because it was the culture of hierarchy that was destroyed for me.

21:03.421 --> 21:05.844
And that's why I left the priesthood.

21:05.904 --> 21:09.849
It wasn't poverty, chastity, or obedience, exactly.

21:09.869 --> 21:16.436
I mean, it was the way in which the whole culture presumes superiors and inferiors.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.521
And I couldn't be part of that anymore.

21:20.581 --> 21:25.326
I couldn't be inferior to them, but neither could I be superior to these other people.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.888
You know, it just...

21:27.475 --> 21:29.238
ended for me, so I couldn't be a priest.

21:29.338 --> 21:34.688
But at the same time, I also learned to believe in a God who himself had rejected that.

21:35.289 --> 21:38.215
That's what the story of Jesus is all about for me.

21:38.896 --> 21:47.972
So by the end of it, my faith in Jesus and what Christianity is about was more powerful than ever, even if my role in the church was impossible now.

21:48.914 --> 21:50.377
So I'm still a Catholic.

21:50.457 --> 21:50.597
I

21:52.130 --> 22:00.821
I'm a dissenting Catholic, and I'm in tension with the way in which the Church is clinging to this old mode of... A dissenting Catholic.

22:02.583 --> 22:12.735
And I still care very much about the Church and argue with the Church and argue against this hierarchical authoritarian form that it embraced.

22:13.797 --> 22:17.361
But for me, the war gave me this...

22:18.387 --> 22:19.888
position from which to dissent.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.650
It's very ironic.

22:29.537 --> 22:32.320
Well, yeah, not just ours, but our parents as well, I think.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.864
I mean, it's, and it's, it's, it's for better and for worse, I would say.

22:37.485 --> 22:39.386
And I meant that in a very uncomfortable way.

22:39.406 --> 22:40.688
Right, for better and for worse.

22:40.768 --> 22:46.453
We, we, obviously a lot of our cultural problems today and political problems today go back to

22:47.058 --> 22:54.169
the breakdown of our ability to believe in the exercise of power in our government.

22:55.611 --> 23:11.476
But the bad part is we see it manifest every day, the nitpicking of political leadership, the inability to trust our politicians, et cetera, et cetera.

23:11.496 --> 23:14.601
But the good part is also that there's a way in which the American people

23:14.885 --> 23:19.972
are very resolute and very clear about what they will and won't allow.

23:20.713 --> 23:25.198
We could have had savage wars in Central America in our time.

23:25.278 --> 23:30.785
We could have had a savage war with the Russians in our time.

23:31.246 --> 23:39.076
Something broke in the American war-making impulse in Vietnam, and I think that's very powerful, very important.

23:40.017 --> 23:40.538
You say that

23:41.294 --> 23:45.118
Whenever you hear the song, beautiful tune, there's always a sense of sadness.

23:45.138 --> 23:49.902
And songs, of course, music has the power to do that.

23:50.203 --> 23:54.587
You can make music, flashbacks, wherever you were, whatever you were doing in your life.

23:55.307 --> 23:58.130
And as you said, you get a profound sense of sadness.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.031
Right.

23:59.511 --> 24:07.739
Do you, by expansion, get a profound sense of sadness when you think about your relationship with your father during that period?

24:07.920 --> 24:10.542
What could have been... Was this

24:12.057 --> 24:14.280
Did you set off in a path of no return?

24:14.580 --> 24:16.663
Did it have to follow the course that it did?

24:17.063 --> 24:23.371
Have you ever played out in your mind things you would like to have done differently that might have affected the relationship?

24:24.512 --> 24:27.456
Well, I wish that I were... I know what you mean.

24:27.996 --> 24:30.520
I do feel deeply sad about it, obviously.

24:31.140 --> 24:36.647
I had this fantasy when I was writing the book, Nick, that by the end of it, I'm going to feel fine about this.

24:38.298 --> 24:52.719
And at the end of this story, I'm going to have worked through all this stuff, and there's going to be a knot I'm going to tie, and I'm going to be able to put my pen down and say, you know, thanks be to God, this has been a great experience.

24:52.880 --> 25:06.600
And it shocked me, really, to get to the end of the story and just feel completely, to use my father's word, heartbroken by it, which I did, and I still feel it, and

25:07.525 --> 25:27.032
frankly, it's one of the, it confuses me as a professional writer now in terms of the publishing process, because for me the book is essentially so sad that I don't know how in the world I can meet the public about it.

25:29.735 --> 25:35.944
But, I mean, I would include you in that as a representative of the public in this encounter we're having now.

25:35.984 --> 25:36.064
It's

25:37.124 --> 25:41.130
It's confusing to me, really, because it's a very sad story.

25:43.013 --> 25:43.414
Finally.

25:43.935 --> 25:46.799
Briefly, can you still change typos in the book?

25:47.881 --> 25:49.964
This has been corrected.

25:50.906 --> 25:52.188
There are plenty of mistakes in there.

25:52.328 --> 25:52.969
I got one.

25:52.989 --> 25:54.331
It's small, but it's on page 38.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.514
It's called Adolf P.H.

25:56.554 --> 25:57.977
Adolf Hitler is what it happened.

25:57.997 --> 25:58.878
I hope that's caught.

25:59.279 --> 26:01.622
It's too late if it isn't, but I hope it's caught.

26:01.702 --> 26:02.584
It's no big deal.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.645
It is a big deal, actually.

26:03.665 --> 26:04.667
I'd hate to see it.

26:05.103 --> 26:08.126
But that's the only one I found.

26:08.146 --> 26:11.048
If you're coming out in May, there may be a chance.

26:11.068 --> 26:11.528
I'll call.

26:11.548 --> 26:12.169
I'll call.

26:12.549 --> 26:13.690
I'll go crazy about that.

26:13.710 --> 26:14.111
I'll call.

26:14.371 --> 26:17.854
I was changing things up until they audited me.

26:18.014 --> 26:20.356
They wouldn't take my calls anymore.

26:20.376 --> 26:22.057
They said, you're going to get charged for these things.

26:22.077 --> 26:22.898
I said, I don't care.

26:22.978 --> 26:23.479
I don't care.

26:23.599 --> 26:24.559
It's got to be right.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.582
I'm sorry to go off on that.

26:27.682 --> 26:29.043
No, I appreciate that.

26:29.063 --> 26:30.585
It's not PH.

26:30.605 --> 26:32.526
I love the students.

26:32.546 --> 26:34.688
At one point, at some point, you have to

26:35.410 --> 26:38.254
I asked you about the state of your faith when you did that.

26:38.294 --> 26:40.177
You gave me that, I think.

26:43.842 --> 27:05.232
Because this primary piece is for Publishers Weekly, you know, there are things that they want to know for their audience, which I don't necessarily want for my newspaper audience, but they really want to follow the chronology of the development of the writer, they want to know agents, editors, the nuts and bolts,

27:05.667 --> 27:12.636
So, but I think we can do this in a way that you left... Of course, I read the book, and I just have to take that.

27:13.858 --> 27:14.499
Alan Tate.

27:14.539 --> 27:16.661
Why don't you just talk a little bit about Alan Tate?

27:17.202 --> 27:19.145
Well... He gave you permission to be a writer.

27:19.165 --> 27:20.907
He gave me... And he said you couldn't do both.

27:20.927 --> 27:22.269
And he said I couldn't do both, right.

27:22.389 --> 27:32.502
Maybe you can just... Well, you know, Alan Tate was so gracious toward me

27:33.055 --> 27:41.324
I teach writing, and I regard him as a kind of model of how to give young writers the benefit of the doubt.

27:42.225 --> 27:45.549
It gave me a huge benefit of the doubt.

27:45.569 --> 27:56.862
And he did give me permission to be a writer, and I tell the story in the book of how he inscribed his collective poems to me, for James, with best wishes in your two vocations.

27:58.163 --> 28:00.426
And then he handed me the book, and I read that inscription.

28:00.466 --> 28:01.647
I was very moved by it.

28:01.667 --> 28:02.488
I thought, oh, what a nice story.

28:02.738 --> 28:16.979
But what really moved me about it was he was including and he was affirming that I had the vocation to be a poet, which I took as an enormous affirmation from Alan Tate.

28:17.840 --> 28:29.978
And when I read it, and my heart leaped, leapt as I read it, and I looked up at him, and then he was sort of sadly shaking his head, and then he said, his addendum, but you can't have both.

28:31.763 --> 28:54.733
know he said as if i did know and i of course thought he didn't he had an old-fashioned idea yeah i didn't think he was right but he was and then later of course i felt haunted by that what year was this 66 well i was ordained in 69 yeah i left yeah yeah

28:55.169 --> 29:18.392
this really does prefigure right right when i do these things i'm always in my mind trying to find my lead right my kicker how i am right i think i have both right now well alan tate is probably yeah the other thing is that i went to alan tate then in 68 for permission to leave the priesthood and be a writer and he didn't recognize me but his own need then

29:18.845 --> 29:25.452
called out of me an act of pastoral ministry, which sent me back into the priesthood.

29:26.013 --> 29:38.467
So anyway, I guess at that point in 66 now, you're 23 years old, I guess.

29:38.487 --> 29:45.975
And you're not writing professionally, and you're not writing for publication necessarily, outside of the church, whatever, which is later.

29:46.716 --> 29:46.776
But

29:47.347 --> 29:58.659
That must have been giving you some sense that there is something else in life besides going into the church, becoming a career Air Force officer.

29:58.819 --> 29:59.720
Right, another world.

29:59.760 --> 30:00.541
Another world.

30:00.721 --> 30:02.843
Right, which opens up to me, why?

30:03.184 --> 30:08.009
Because of the Paulus Fathers, who affirmed my vocation as a writer.

30:08.129 --> 30:09.030
It's a very good fortune.

30:09.190 --> 30:09.871
Right, it's true.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.833
It's true, it's true.

30:12.294 --> 30:13.675
This community of men,

30:14.380 --> 30:17.625
you know, really sent me into my life as a writer.

30:18.065 --> 30:18.406
They nurtured it.

30:18.426 --> 30:19.187
They did, yes.

30:19.207 --> 30:19.968
They encouraged it.

30:20.068 --> 30:20.829
They encouraged it.

30:20.849 --> 30:22.331
And they were my teachers.

30:22.351 --> 30:24.054
That wasn't lost on me, by the way.

30:24.074 --> 30:24.955
You gathered that, right?

30:25.015 --> 30:29.101
I mean, it's a very powerful part of my experience.

30:29.301 --> 30:37.753
And even when they knew it was going to take me away from them, they found ways to affirm me.

30:40.276 --> 30:41.298
As a writer, yes.

30:41.318 --> 30:41.518
Wonderful.

30:41.853 --> 30:51.827
Yeah, I worship at the Paula Center here, where I used to live, on Park Street, just down from the State House.

30:51.987 --> 30:53.249
The name of the Paula Center?

30:53.429 --> 30:55.472
The Paula Center, yeah.

30:55.492 --> 30:56.874
And how often do you do this?

30:56.894 --> 30:59.958
Well, I was there Sunday, you know, I go there regularly, Sundays.

31:00.339 --> 31:01.120
Palm Sundays?

31:01.140 --> 31:03.644
Yeah.

31:03.664 --> 31:04.445
Yeah.

31:04.465 --> 31:06.848
And how about your family?

31:06.868 --> 31:08.130
Well, Lex is an Episcopalian.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.632
We have an ecumenical marriage.

31:10.878 --> 31:16.525
And our children are being raised to leave a lot of these petty disputes behind, I hope.

31:18.427 --> 31:33.064
Well, as you know better than anybody because you've worked with her, I'm married to Alexandra Marshall, who's a novelist.

31:33.124 --> 31:36.008
Lizzy is, that's L-I-Z-Z-Y.

31:36.048 --> 31:37.770
And that is her name?

31:37.790 --> 31:38.691
Yeah, Lizzy, yeah.

31:38.958 --> 31:42.242
or Elizabeth, but we call her Lizzy, L-I-Z-Z-Y, is 16.

31:42.402 --> 31:45.926
She's a sophomore in high school.

31:46.567 --> 31:53.775
And Patrick, who's named for Patrick Hughes, about whom I write in the book, who's that man who skates across the pond.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.877
I love that scene.

31:55.897 --> 31:59.161
I thought you were setting us up for a tragedy there.

31:59.181 --> 32:00.722
Yeah, it's quite the opposite, isn't it?

32:00.742 --> 32:01.764
I thought he was going down.

32:01.784 --> 32:03.385
Yeah, right.

32:03.405 --> 32:04.627
It's quite the opposite, isn't it?

32:04.667 --> 32:06.709
It's a glorious thing that he skates ahead of that.

32:06.749 --> 32:07.530
It's wonderful.

32:08.911 --> 32:17.599
It's a version of what you said about God putting our eyes on the front of our heads, you know.

32:18.100 --> 32:18.821
Don't look bad.

32:20.262 --> 32:23.185
But Patrick is 13, about to be 14 next week.

32:23.565 --> 32:29.791
Patrick was born on April 4th, and I remember realizing one day that... That's tomorrow.

32:30.432 --> 32:30.932
It's tomorrow.

32:31.713 --> 32:35.156
I remember realizing one day that my... That's what I said next week.

32:35.417 --> 32:35.897
That my

32:36.788 --> 33:04.737
assumption about april 4th was that it would always be a cursed day in my life because it was the day martin the king was shot that day i describe in there as a kind of pivotal moment in my life that's the night my father says to me one word see and so years later to realize that even a cursed day like that can be transformed now of course it's

33:05.982 --> 33:08.806
just a very precious day.

33:08.826 --> 33:11.890
My older daughter was born on the 13th.

33:12.471 --> 33:18.238
My wife was labeled for 17 hours, and she was born on the 13th hour, on the 13th day.

33:18.379 --> 33:19.280
No kidding, wow.

33:19.300 --> 33:22.905
So I can tell you immediately, 13 becomes my favorite.

33:22.925 --> 33:24.467
Yeah, your favorite number.

33:24.487 --> 33:25.088
Yeah, right, right.

33:25.108 --> 33:29.594
You just say, well, that changes it for the better, you know.

33:29.934 --> 33:32.077
And I go after 13 now.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.899
Every time I see it, I embrace it.

33:33.919 --> 33:34.941
That's great.

33:34.961 --> 33:35.061
Yeah.

33:35.362 --> 33:38.246
You know, I said, I'm not going to lay baggage on this kid.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.870
Her first birthday was a flight in the 13th.

33:40.890 --> 33:43.234
So, you know, that's the way that goes.

33:45.037 --> 33:49.203
So you left in 75, and then you met Lexa.

33:49.223 --> 33:51.927
You just say in the book that you both had the same literary.

33:51.947 --> 33:52.808
We had, right.

33:52.828 --> 33:54.331
And that's how we can kind of get into that.

33:54.451 --> 33:54.711
Right.

33:54.751 --> 33:57.716
Don Cutler, who at the time... Don Donald?

33:57.756 --> 33:59.298
Donald Cutler, C-U-T-L-E-R.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.420
A New York agent?

34:00.440 --> 34:02.123
He was at Sterling Lord then.

34:03.184 --> 34:03.765
And...

34:07.137 --> 34:36.570
he uh he became my agent because i had a play done at the berkshire theater festival which he saw in workshop in in new york and he had lex as a client and he introduced us and he's also an episcopal priest really and so he also married us

34:36.719 --> 34:40.684
It is amazing, yeah, in an ecumenical service.

34:40.824 --> 34:43.166
You don't think this can't be a movie?

34:43.186 --> 34:49.113
And he's still my agent, and I'm very devoted to him.

34:49.153 --> 34:55.240
And he placed my first novel at Little Brown, which was Madonna Red, which was published in 76.

34:55.421 --> 34:57.964
Did that become a film?

34:57.984 --> 35:00.887
No, I've never had any of my novels made into a film, no.

35:01.846 --> 35:09.815
There was a lot of talk about that being a film, and it was owned by various studios, Robert Redford and all that, right?

35:11.397 --> 35:13.059
And I've been publishing every two or three years.

35:14.220 --> 35:16.002
How did you get him as an agent?

35:17.204 --> 35:20.968
I had a play that the Berkshire Theatre Festival did.

35:20.988 --> 35:21.589
You told me that.

35:21.609 --> 35:24.752
Yeah, I left the priesthood, went to Stockbridge.

35:24.832 --> 35:25.833
The play was done in New York.

35:25.894 --> 35:26.714
He came to the play.

35:26.815 --> 35:28.637
Did you tell me you told me that?

35:28.657 --> 35:28.917
Yeah.

35:29.386 --> 35:30.968
See, that's the problem with tapers.

35:30.988 --> 35:31.429
It's okay.

35:31.689 --> 35:38.898
I used to take notes, but you're thinking ahead of where you want to go, and I think the attention you ought to be.

35:38.918 --> 35:43.344
And briefly, tell me, is Lexus still writing?

35:43.424 --> 35:47.710
And Lexus publishing a novel next year at Houghton-Efflin as it happens.

35:48.751 --> 35:58.043
It's called Wedding Pictures, a novel about... It's a kind of love story for

35:58.900 --> 36:06.914
Grown Ups, which is a phrase a reviewer used about her novel, Gus and Brons, years ago.

36:06.974 --> 36:08.416
But that's what this is.

36:08.436 --> 36:09.398
That was her first.

36:09.418 --> 36:10.039
Yeah, that was her first.

36:10.059 --> 36:11.862
And then there was Tender Offer, which you write.

36:12.824 --> 36:13.866
And anything since then?

36:13.886 --> 36:18.494
And Brass Bed, another novel, which was published maybe eight years ago.

36:19.956 --> 36:23.322
And then this will be her next novel.

36:24.145 --> 36:28.131
And she has the same agent as well?

36:28.151 --> 36:29.513
She's actually changed.

36:29.793 --> 36:33.839
She's Elaine Markson as her agent.

36:34.219 --> 36:34.540
Oh, I see.

36:34.940 --> 36:36.683
Okay.

36:36.703 --> 36:52.245
And then what is it like to have a... I love it when I ask you a couple of people who focus on rights, you know, Margaret Drabble and Michael Hallway, and of course Justin and Anna Krasnick over there.

36:53.828 --> 37:21.270
well we we we do we work in separate rooms but we're it's a consoling experience to have somebody else who shares the life it's a kind of cottage industry we you know we could be country curtains after a certain point I tend to be shy about my work until I'm

37:22.398 --> 37:24.040
pretty firmly connected to it.

37:24.741 --> 37:32.590
I write in longhand the first draft, whatever I do, and I don't show it to anybody until I've done the second draft on the word processor.

37:33.912 --> 37:37.195
So I go a long time without anybody seeing what I'm doing.

37:37.295 --> 37:39.778
And even in this particular book as well?

37:39.818 --> 37:40.099
Yes.

37:42.001 --> 37:45.485
Did you ever discuss certain things with her about the what or not?

37:46.747 --> 37:52.253
Yeah, well, to the extent that I was, of course, discussing great questions in my life, yes, but...

37:53.583 --> 38:00.391
But I have it, you know, the work has to gel to a certain point before I can show it to somebody.

38:03.094 --> 38:06.778
So Madonna read this first book published in 1976.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.001
That's just a year after reading.

38:09.701 --> 38:10.442
Right.

38:10.462 --> 38:13.526
Was this in progress while you were still with the book?

38:13.546 --> 38:14.126
No, it wasn't.

38:14.167 --> 38:20.554
I wrote it, well, I resigned from the ministry, from the pastoral work of the priesthood in 1974.

38:21.835 --> 38:22.476
And then I had

38:22.760 --> 38:25.525
A year's, quote, leave of absence, which is when I was writing.

38:25.585 --> 38:32.177
I wrote a play and a novel from in 74 into 75, and then it was published in 76.

38:32.317 --> 38:33.679
And the next book after that?

38:34.321 --> 38:36.745
It was Mortal Friends, published in 70.

38:37.426 --> 38:38.508
And we first met then, right?

38:38.608 --> 38:39.169
That was in 78.

38:39.189 --> 38:41.193
That was a full selection book of the month.

38:41.213 --> 38:43.577
Yeah, it was.

38:44.398 --> 38:46.422
It was the book that gave me my career.

38:47.532 --> 38:50.696
And tell me how the genesis of that worked.

38:50.716 --> 39:00.930
Well, when I was a priest, when I was a priest, I had this day off a week, and it was always a weekday, because priests work on weekends.

39:02.913 --> 39:06.298
And I was alone, and I was a solitary person.

39:06.999 --> 39:11.345
And when I came to Boston, I loved the city of Boston.

39:11.365 --> 39:13.207
As you know, I'm a military brat.

39:13.287 --> 39:15.931
I don't grow up with any particular roots anyplace.

39:16.031 --> 39:17.353
Washington is no place to have

39:17.536 --> 39:17.956
roots.

39:18.998 --> 39:27.487
And the solid, rooted culture of Irish Boston really swept me away.

39:28.508 --> 39:29.028
I loved it.

39:29.289 --> 39:37.758
And on my days off when I was a priest, so really from 69 right through 74, 75, what I loved doing was walking.

39:38.198 --> 39:39.980
And I loved the stories of the city.

39:40.020 --> 39:44.305
And I just gathered the stories of the city that way.

39:45.746 --> 39:47.408
So after I'd written

39:49.480 --> 39:53.864
Madonna read, I stopped and I said, now what do I really want to write here?

39:55.686 --> 40:07.217
Boston's busing crisis was underway and the Irish conflict with blacks was very powerful and I was really obsessed with what's behind this?

40:07.317 --> 40:11.801
How did the Boston Irish get to be who they are?

40:13.262 --> 40:17.226
And so I

40:18.708 --> 40:19.609
I told the story.

40:19.809 --> 40:25.153
I told what I took to be the story of who the Boston Irish are.

40:25.614 --> 40:27.756
And that turned out to be Mortal Friends.

40:27.776 --> 40:29.057
And that was Little Brown, I think?

40:29.077 --> 40:29.977
Little Brown, yeah.

40:32.019 --> 40:48.613
Little Brown published my first four novels, which were Madonna Red, Mortal Friends, Fault Lines, my first five novels, actually, Fault Lines,

40:48.813 --> 40:51.457
which was 80, 80.

40:54.161 --> 41:01.392
Family Trade, which was... That's right, about Richard III, an actor and his girlfriend.

41:02.854 --> 41:09.324
I was a playwright in residence for a year at the Actor's Studio in New York, you know, when I left the priesthood.

41:11.087 --> 41:18.077
And then Family Trade in 81, maybe, and 83 or 84, Prince of Peace.

41:19.677 --> 41:43.902
And then I published in 85 or 86 at Dutton, Supply of Heroes, a novel about the Irish rising, which was basically inspired by my mother's family.

41:44.943 --> 41:46.125
Did you have to do any traveling?

41:46.265 --> 41:46.525
I did.

41:46.545 --> 41:47.846
I was in Ireland a lot for that.

41:47.886 --> 41:49.448
It was set in Tipperary.

41:50.018 --> 41:59.191
It's basically about the Irish who fought in the war for the British during World War I, as opposed to the Irish who were rebels.

41:59.231 --> 42:12.009
The genesis of that was that my mother grew up with the family myth that her uncle, Jim, had died in the rebellion in 1916, and so he was an anti-British patriot.

42:13.772 --> 42:18.979
I went to Ireland in 1970 and went to his village, tracked down his village,

42:20.512 --> 42:27.723
because I was curious about the story and I wanted to find out what role he had played in the Easter Uprising and so forth.

42:28.985 --> 42:35.115
I found his tombstone in a little village up in the hills in Tipperary in a long abandoned graveyard.

42:36.117 --> 42:38.861
And it showed his name and the fact that he died in 1916.

42:38.941 --> 42:41.104
So I'm thinking, geez, maybe there's something to this.

42:41.906 --> 42:43.648
But it was the tombstone of a British soldier.

42:45.391 --> 42:46.593
And it said, rule Britannia.

42:47.354 --> 42:47.835
And it said,

42:48.085 --> 42:49.887
under his dates, killed in France.

42:52.129 --> 42:55.752
So that the family myth had completely turned over who he was.

42:55.812 --> 42:57.053
He was a British soldier.

42:57.614 --> 43:05.301
Well, I just... No, I mean, well, then I found some people in the village, got the story, and I thought, well, here's the story.

43:05.341 --> 43:15.091
And 250 Irish rebels took over the post office in Dublin that day, Easter Monday, 1916.

43:15.651 --> 43:16.692
And at that moment,

43:17.414 --> 43:26.706
250,000 Irish Catholics were in British uniform in France.

43:26.726 --> 43:28.028
It's a story people don't know.

43:28.048 --> 43:33.295
50,000 Irish people died in World War I.

43:33.315 --> 43:35.417
50,000.

43:36.058 --> 43:40.003
That's as many... You know what a trauma we had in this country.

43:40.083 --> 43:42.827
I mean, imagine a country that's only 6 million people.

43:43.908 --> 43:45.210
50,000...

43:46.338 --> 43:48.320
So Supply of Heroes tells that story.

43:48.360 --> 44:08.163
That's from, there was the Unionist, the Protestant Unionist, Edward Carson, who introduced the legislation in 1916 in Parliament for a draft law, for conscription, the first time the British Empire had ever had a draft.

44:09.225 --> 44:13.830
And of course they had to draft people by then because the volunteers had all been killed.

44:15.127 --> 44:22.294
And his speech included the line about the draft, the necessary supply of heroes must be maintained at all costs.

44:23.975 --> 44:29.741
That's what they had going, a supply of heroes, just feeding them into the maw of the trenches.

44:30.101 --> 44:45.015
And then after that, I published Firebird, a Cold War spy novel set in Washington with Dutton.

44:45.468 --> 44:52.159
My editor at Dutton was Joe Cannon, a man I admire very much.

44:52.419 --> 44:55.244
And then he came to Houghton Mifflin, and I went to Houghton Mifflin.

44:55.664 --> 44:57.467
Joe, C-A-N-N-O-N.

44:57.487 --> 44:59.170
Cannon, K-A-N-O-N.

45:00.492 --> 45:01.273
Right.

45:01.293 --> 45:01.574
Still there?

45:01.714 --> 45:03.737
No, and he left Houghton Mifflin last year.

45:05.219 --> 45:06.662
And now I'm working with Wendy Strothman.

45:08.144 --> 45:10.007
S-T-R-O-T-H-M-A-N.

45:11.995 --> 45:14.357
Did we get all the editors early in the 90s?

45:14.377 --> 45:17.820
Bill Phillips at Little Brown gave me my career.

45:18.661 --> 45:23.485
And he was a wonderful editor, and he's still the editor-in-chief at Little Brown.

45:24.826 --> 45:27.168
And he's a... P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.

45:27.649 --> 45:28.670
P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.

45:29.290 --> 45:30.551
William Phillips.

45:30.871 --> 45:33.494
William Phillips.

45:33.614 --> 45:34.535
Gave me my career.

45:34.695 --> 45:36.116
What extent?

45:36.136 --> 45:40.720
Well, he bought my first novel, and he shepherded me through my first five novels.

45:40.801 --> 45:44.467
And give me a little preceding of Madonna Red.

45:45.228 --> 45:47.452
Madonna Red is a thriller.

45:47.972 --> 45:53.321
It's about an IRA attempt to kill the British ambassador to the United States, set in Washington.

45:53.702 --> 45:59.551
Now, one would have thought, you see, involved in all the things that you were involved in.

46:00.292 --> 46:06.522
I mean, it's so uncharacteristic here to be going out and doing a commercial entertainment.

46:06.805 --> 46:07.126
Yeah.

46:07.166 --> 46:08.287
Did you see it?

46:08.307 --> 46:09.469
I did, yeah.

46:09.690 --> 46:14.498
I mean, Madonna Red is the most deliberately commercial of the novels I've written.

46:15.058 --> 46:17.022
So what were you thinking?

46:17.042 --> 46:18.764
I've got to make a living, or this is my job?

46:18.784 --> 46:22.350
Well, I don't know.

46:22.571 --> 46:27.499
I didn't have any literary pretensions about my work.

46:27.519 --> 46:28.160
I still don't.

46:28.260 --> 46:33.268
I think of myself as a storyteller.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.197
And I set out to tell a story.

46:36.237 --> 46:41.264
I wanted to tell a story about the priesthood, since I had just left the priesthood.

46:41.284 --> 46:49.976
But I didn't want to directly tell the story, and I also wanted to tell... And so the hero in that, in Madonna Red, is a priest.

46:51.938 --> 47:04.335
And it's a thriller, but it's a story about a priest who goes from the beginning of the story, the first line of that story, at least at one draft, I'm not sure how it was...

47:04.720 --> 47:06.462
Father Tierney knew exactly what to do.

47:09.245 --> 47:13.910
And it was describing the confidence with which he would enact the ritual of the Mass.

47:13.930 --> 47:27.925
And by the end of the story, the last line... I'm not sure how... I remember vividly in the writing of it, the last line was, Father Tierney couldn't remember what was next.

47:29.567 --> 47:34.272
He had come to a point where his hold on the form

47:34.893 --> 47:35.474
was gone.

47:36.394 --> 47:46.323
And it was my own way of getting into the business of my own having lost a hold of this ordered world of the priesthood.

47:47.144 --> 47:54.570
And I did it by telling... I did it as... indirectly, but it was as direct as I could do it at that point in my life.

47:55.451 --> 48:01.016
So I, in a sense, took refuge in the form of a political thriller.

48:01.777 --> 48:02.577
The red lights still on?

48:02.898 --> 48:03.398
Yes, it is.

48:04.880 --> 48:11.008
you began as a poet and did a playwright.

48:11.308 --> 48:11.549
Right.

48:11.929 --> 48:18.197
I mean, the two most impossible things to, you know, it's hard enough to get a book published.

48:18.217 --> 48:18.478
Right.

48:19.439 --> 48:20.560
Try and get a play produced.

48:20.640 --> 48:20.881
Right.

48:21.702 --> 48:22.983
And staged.

48:23.004 --> 48:23.244
Right.

48:23.624 --> 48:26.688
Try and get a volume of poetry published and then try and make a living off it.

48:26.849 --> 48:27.149
Right.

48:27.209 --> 48:34.178
If these are the two areas you, I wouldn't say toyed with, that you dealt with.

48:34.394 --> 48:35.035
Right.

48:35.795 --> 48:38.298
Do you still write poetry, number one?

48:38.438 --> 48:39.579
I don't write poetry, no.

48:39.959 --> 48:43.743
And I haven't written a play in many years.

48:46.946 --> 48:54.234
I found the form of the novel and really found a home in it.

48:54.554 --> 48:56.256
I feel very much a novelist.

48:59.078 --> 49:02.882
The spaciousness of it is important to me.

49:03.672 --> 49:15.426
But I have to believe the experience of working as a playwright certainly helped you technically and professionally.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.670
I mean, when you want to know the carpentry, you're putting together.

49:18.690 --> 49:19.311
Yes, right.

49:19.371 --> 49:22.935
And the structure of narrative is basic.

49:23.256 --> 49:29.123
And I've learned a lot over the years from playwriting, but also from novel writing, what the structure of narrative is.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.625
And I teach writing, and that's been very helpful to me also.

49:33.765 --> 49:36.429
I teach writing at Emerson College.

49:38.271 --> 49:40.294
And I've been doing that for most of a decade.

49:43.058 --> 49:43.939
Once a week during the year?

49:44.240 --> 49:45.181
Once a week, yeah.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.803
Are there seminars?

49:46.823 --> 49:47.625
It's a workshop.

49:48.546 --> 49:50.208
Twelve writing students.

49:50.509 --> 49:52.391
They're graduate students in writing.

49:53.453 --> 49:53.893
Try to.

49:53.933 --> 49:54.995
Try to.

49:55.055 --> 49:58.620
Try to affirm what's good in what they're doing.

49:59.056 --> 50:02.140
and tell them the truth about it and try to be a good editor to people.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.722
Is Tate alive?

50:03.802 --> 50:09.089
Tate died about 19... in the early 70s.

50:09.149 --> 50:11.231
I forget exactly when.

50:11.412 --> 50:15.297
He really didn't see what became of you.

50:15.517 --> 50:17.259
No, I think he died maybe in the mid-70s.

50:17.359 --> 50:17.900
No, he didn't.

50:19.562 --> 50:20.323
That would have been nice.

50:20.423 --> 50:20.784
It would have.

50:21.645 --> 50:23.827
It would have meant a lot to me.

50:23.847 --> 50:26.491
You still have, of course, a bit of a book you inscribed to.

50:26.511 --> 50:26.771
I do.

50:27.993 --> 50:28.253
I do.

50:28.672 --> 50:31.196
And that must be the... Yeah, as a book lover, I'll show it to you.

50:31.216 --> 50:32.958
I'll take you up and show it to you.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.562
Pardon me for jumping around here.

50:35.582 --> 50:36.463
No problem.

50:36.483 --> 50:41.270
I think we are covering some great stuff.

50:41.290 --> 50:46.457
While I'm looking at my notes here, if there's anything that you want to... We're covering, going very quickly.

50:46.477 --> 50:55.049
Of course, we've got some books, you know, and because it's so out of my breath, I mean, I must feel free to take what I... Sure, sure, sure.

50:55.069 --> 50:57.953
And I'll be happy to call you and go over your quotes

50:58.574 --> 50:59.795
Okay, fine, great.

50:59.815 --> 51:00.716
I believe in doing it.

51:00.776 --> 51:01.878
Great, I'd appreciate it.

51:01.898 --> 51:02.699
I'd like to get it right.

51:02.719 --> 51:04.841
In fact, I'll probably read you the whole story.

51:05.101 --> 51:06.042
I'd appreciate it.

51:06.223 --> 51:10.928
Well, I'm in your hands, so I'll... No, no, I'd like to get it right.

51:11.128 --> 51:12.850
Good, good, great.

51:12.950 --> 51:14.972
And inevitably we'll find a few mistakes.

51:15.072 --> 51:15.633
Good.

51:15.653 --> 51:16.454
And so we'll fix them.

51:16.474 --> 51:17.635
Great, great.

51:17.856 --> 51:21.720
So don't worry about how this is going to... Okay, great.

51:21.740 --> 51:24.463
Gene McCarthy, worked with Gene McCarthy...

51:25.844 --> 51:34.694
I guess you said one fact or another that I wondered if this was a story you felt you had to tell, or was it a story that you felt it was time to tell?

51:35.936 --> 51:55.058
Well, the single most powerful motive I have in telling the story, there are a lot of reasons, of course, but one day when I watched my children shrink back in

51:55.426 --> 52:04.780
in fear and mystification from my senile father who really wasn't capable of relating to them.

52:06.082 --> 52:15.717
That overwhelmed me with sadness because I knew they would never have a memory of him as he was when he was grave.

52:17.259 --> 52:21.906
And so I was aware at a certain point of

52:22.679 --> 52:25.622
resolving to tell the story in a way that my children could have it.

52:27.223 --> 52:33.689
And to make sure they understood both who he was, who my mother was, and what we'd been through together.

52:35.030 --> 52:42.597
So I quite deliberately dedicate this novel, I mean this novel, this memoir, to Lexa, Lizzie, and Pat.

52:43.578 --> 52:47.562
But Lizzie and Pat gave me the main motive I had for writing it.

52:50.244 --> 52:52.146
What you've described is that

52:53.088 --> 52:59.018
Well, I wouldn't say not any.

52:59.719 --> 53:06.952
You know, there was this warmth of a common idea of father-son manhood.

53:08.674 --> 53:11.058
But my father was a reserved man, generally.

53:11.299 --> 53:18.471
And, of course, as I became a man, we were apart.

53:19.919 --> 53:26.709
I remember that moment of delivering the newspapers with him as a moment of tremendous closeness and warmth.

53:28.571 --> 53:33.058
Obviously there weren't a lot of those, because that wouldn't stand out quite so dramatically if there were.

53:34.440 --> 53:41.029
Is there anything you regret in the relationship that you wish had been there?

53:41.049 --> 53:45.015
Well, I regret that I wasn't...

53:46.092 --> 53:47.714
I mean, this is like regretting history.

53:47.794 --> 53:52.661
I regret that I didn't know then what I know now about how complicated life is.

53:53.862 --> 53:57.146
When I was in conflict with my father, I thought things were pretty simple.

53:57.947 --> 54:00.310
You either for the war or against it.

54:00.411 --> 54:09.743
I didn't understand that a man of conscience inside the Pentagon would have his own version of the struggle that seemed so important to me outside the Pentagon.

54:09.863 --> 54:15.390
I wish I'd understood more the levels of moral complication that I understand now.

54:15.522 --> 54:35.612
And, of course, it was never articulated to you directly, but you really believed that being the solid devout Catholics that you kind of weren't, that deep down, you know, this has almost been evocating to all Irish Catholics, is that there was a sense of sin here.

54:36.213 --> 54:37.555
Yeah.

54:37.575 --> 54:41.361
Your father, you know, your mother always had... Right.

54:41.780 --> 54:45.486
I mean, she never said this, but there was a sense that she had lured him away.

54:45.626 --> 54:45.907
Right.

54:46.047 --> 54:49.813
And, of course, my conclusions about that come from the fact that she said nothing about it.

54:49.833 --> 54:50.214
Yeah.

54:51.155 --> 54:53.098
That's an intuitive idea, probably, I guess.

54:53.138 --> 54:53.639
Right.

54:53.920 --> 54:54.200
Right.

54:54.400 --> 55:00.911
But knowing your mother and your father and also knowing the community that you come from.

55:00.971 --> 55:01.271
Right.

55:02.153 --> 55:02.473
Right.

55:03.355 --> 55:03.635
Right.

55:04.777 --> 55:07.281
So, really, there were plans for you to... Right.

55:08.307 --> 55:12.773
I don't know if you know where his tone is.

55:12.793 --> 55:14.535
I began to think of it as taking his place.

55:16.738 --> 55:18.541
Taking his place.

55:18.801 --> 55:19.602
Yeah.

55:20.984 --> 55:24.869
Which, of course, is the meaning I took from that moment which I described when he weeps.

55:26.171 --> 55:31.118
The one time he weeps when I'm blessing him after I've just been ordained to the priesthood.

55:32.860 --> 55:36.104
The meaning I take from that is I'm in his place now.

55:36.145 --> 55:36.525
The

55:36.995 --> 55:38.557
the burden, the curse is lifted.

55:39.097 --> 55:45.986
And you always confess at some point, and it's not hypocrisy, but you feel hypocritical at some point.

55:46.246 --> 55:50.030
There are points where you could have said things that you didn't say.

55:50.271 --> 55:53.014
You could have done another thing with Hoover.

55:53.995 --> 55:54.376
Right.

55:54.396 --> 55:56.438
Your brother says he's a vegetarian.

55:56.478 --> 55:59.422
He said, here, I'm eating turkey for the second time today.

55:59.442 --> 55:59.722
Right.

55:59.742 --> 56:00.723
And I'm the priest.

56:01.444 --> 56:01.925
Right.

56:01.945 --> 56:02.085
Right.

56:02.105 --> 56:03.246
It's really funny.

56:03.747 --> 56:04.808
It's true.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.241
Right.

56:06.581 --> 56:08.263
Isn't that something?

56:08.804 --> 56:10.666
Is he still a vegetarian?

56:10.686 --> 56:10.926
Yeah.

56:11.126 --> 56:13.509
Now, was this moral of his father?

56:13.709 --> 56:13.909
Yeah.

56:13.929 --> 56:14.269
Like me?

56:14.290 --> 56:18.094
Yeah, no, it was an act of rejection of violence and blood.

56:18.554 --> 56:18.694
Yeah.

56:18.714 --> 56:18.995
Yeah.

56:19.455 --> 56:26.343
So, you see, there are, one would almost like to find out all the different stories of your siblings.

56:26.363 --> 56:26.883
It's true.

56:27.844 --> 56:30.247
That you had a brother being a hard-ass FBI.

56:30.267 --> 56:31.328
Right, right.

56:31.428 --> 56:32.429
He's still there, apparently.

56:32.449 --> 56:32.629
Right.

56:32.649 --> 56:33.450
He just retired.

56:33.851 --> 56:34.391
Really?

56:34.411 --> 56:35.132
He just retired.

56:36.395 --> 56:37.997
Did you discuss it?

56:38.137 --> 56:40.920
He's been in charge of the Unabomber case.

56:40.940 --> 56:42.322
Which case is it?

56:42.342 --> 56:42.642
Oh, really?

56:42.662 --> 56:43.463
That's his case?

56:43.483 --> 56:45.105
Yeah.

56:45.125 --> 56:47.008
I've probably seen him on TV, then.

56:47.028 --> 56:48.229
He hasn't been on TV, no.

56:50.252 --> 56:58.862
So, I mean, you know, he just retired as the assistant special agent in charge of the Chicago field, though.

56:58.962 --> 57:03.387
And, of course, you talk about irony of ironies.

57:03.407 --> 57:04.849
At what point he had a job,

57:05.133 --> 57:09.017
To find your brother, but... Yeah, to find my brother, yeah.

57:09.037 --> 57:11.219
Basically, that was... Yeah, that was the job, right.

57:11.239 --> 57:13.301
In a general sense.

57:13.321 --> 57:22.229
Right, and there I am, you know, my friends getting busted in the Camden draft board, and him being one of the arresting officers, you know.

57:22.389 --> 57:23.651
They came in there with shotguns.

57:23.711 --> 57:26.133
You should... I mean, I had this... They described it to me.

57:26.233 --> 57:32.659
My friends described it to me, these FBI... One girl, a little girl, you know, frail, little flower child.

57:33.989 --> 57:37.995
The double barrel of an FBI agent's shotgun under her chin like this.

57:40.820 --> 57:44.025
And it might have been my brother, because he was one of them.

57:44.045 --> 57:49.674
And then I'm at the trial to testify as a character witness for her.

57:49.774 --> 57:54.781
So how do you resolve these things?

57:55.503 --> 57:58.067
We survived, even then we were able to.

57:58.127 --> 58:02.173
When I went to the Camden trial, I stayed with my brother.

58:02.778 --> 58:03.179
Brian.

58:03.199 --> 58:04.461
We went into the trial together.

58:06.203 --> 58:07.706
And how about the older brother?

58:08.928 --> 58:11.412
He's a professor at the University of Puerto Rico.

58:12.794 --> 58:30.642
Has a certain distance from the family, but we're still... And he and I... Well, our relationship was set by that experience in a sad way.

58:32.174 --> 58:51.000
But my last, at the end of this book, I describe that moment at my father's funeral when my brothers are falling into line behind the casket, just like Kennedy's funeral, you know, with the horse and all that stuff.

58:51.541 --> 58:53.103
You say same bands, different music?

58:53.123 --> 58:54.625
Yeah, same bands, different music.

58:54.765 --> 59:00.493
And as we're falling into line, of course, then we all realize that Joe can't walk with us.

59:03.359 --> 59:04.780
And he's getting into the limousine.

59:05.782 --> 59:12.889
And I had this overwhelming feeling that I wanted him to carry me.

59:12.969 --> 59:16.272
I mean, it was just this feeling of he's who I belong with now.

59:17.814 --> 59:21.958
Have you had any reaction from your family?

59:21.978 --> 59:30.447
Well, the first thing I did when I finished the manuscript last summer was go to CopyCop and make four copies.

59:32.080 --> 59:39.487
and send it to my four brothers with a note saying, this goes no further if you tell me.

59:41.830 --> 59:44.533
You mean you would have terminated it?

59:44.553 --> 59:46.174
Right.

59:46.194 --> 59:50.278
And I said, is there anything in here that you don't want me to write, then tell me.

59:52.180 --> 01:00:00.128
