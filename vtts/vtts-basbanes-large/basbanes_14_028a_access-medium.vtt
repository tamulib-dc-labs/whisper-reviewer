WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:04.020
Always.

00:04.040 --> 00:18.155
For example, here we have, to give you a general view, 350,000 Greek documents from the Byzantine Empire till today.

00:18.676 --> 00:19.256
My goodness.

00:19.937 --> 00:29.127
Almost 13,000 Romanian documents, because the monastery was very much, after the fall of Constantinople,

00:29.748 --> 00:36.874
the Romanian princes became the benefactors and the continuation of Byzantium.

00:37.034 --> 00:41.838
Because Romania was a province of the Roman Empire and later of the Byzantine Empire.

00:41.939 --> 00:45.522
And there were also Christians, the Romanians from the very first century.

00:46.062 --> 00:54.389
Whereas the other Eastern Europeans, Slavs, Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, not Bulgarians, Bulgarians are actually Turks.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.972
But then they mix with the Slavs.

00:57.992 --> 00:58.793
So the other

00:59.127 --> 01:11.541
for example, Ukrainians, Lithuans, etc., etc., they became Christians by the Byzantines in the 11th century, beginning 10th, 11th century.

01:11.641 --> 01:15.265
So there's continuity, and that's why they've been welcomed here.

01:15.305 --> 01:28.020
They have their... And because of the power that the Tsar had, and also the Moldavians, the Romanian princes, the Turks didn't exterminate all the Greeks.

01:28.439 --> 01:38.411
They could have done that and finish up the whole thing and create a new era, a new empire called Turkish Empire.

01:38.431 --> 01:47.282
But yet Byzantium was alive, as you have seen, not only here, but also the rest of Greece, Asia Minor, Cyprus, the islands.

01:47.862 --> 01:49.945
It was alive in the life of the people.

01:50.285 --> 01:58.395
But they were now under this cruel domination, which unfortunately the USA supports.

01:58.595 --> 02:01.679
very much, especially in Cyprus.

02:01.699 --> 02:02.660
This is politics.

02:02.881 --> 02:07.246
Put a bracket... I don't remember doing it.

02:07.266 --> 02:25.911
My politics, I've come from Cyprus, and NATO, unfortunately, gave the blessing for the Turks to invade that little island and kill the people, etc., etc., and NATO is still giving all the force to Turkey.

02:26.592 --> 02:27.673
Whereas for Kuwait,

02:28.075 --> 02:32.780
The USA liberated in the night because they have interest.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.323
For us, for Cyprus, they have other interests, so they didn't care for the people.

02:37.164 --> 02:45.372
And we have 5,000 people killed, half the population, about 250,000 refugees even today.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.476
And there is no light in the future.

02:50.817 --> 02:56.783
And this is because the American policy, not the people of America, the American policy is very cruel.

02:58.315 --> 03:01.259
It is very much directed by the Jewish lobby.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.644
There's no joke with that.

03:04.664 --> 03:05.926
But not the American people.

03:05.946 --> 03:07.888
You always distinguish between the two.

03:09.511 --> 03:15.219
I know that because I was in America for four years, and my parents were there.

03:15.239 --> 03:21.988
And we know what people they are there, and how the policy, unfortunately.

03:22.008 --> 03:27.816
Well, this is always for the strong nation, like Rome, which was a strong nation, to make injustice.

03:28.083 --> 03:34.493
many times, when the Russians, the Soviets, when the Chinese, they have the power.

03:35.474 --> 03:38.198
We have these kind of things, you know, interesting things like that.

03:38.218 --> 03:43.466
The small people kind of survive sometimes, or they struggle.

03:43.486 --> 03:44.187
Yeah.

03:44.208 --> 03:52.961
We hope that the Greek people in America, who have all... Which is a very strong group, by the way.

03:52.981 --> 03:54.623
Which is a very strong group, I know.

03:55.565 --> 03:57.027
They're trying their best to

03:57.445 --> 04:05.814
to create a friendly climate which we would like to have very much with the USA as well as with all the countries because we like peace.

04:05.834 --> 04:06.414
We like peace.

04:07.135 --> 04:08.517
Greeks were never people of war.

04:09.237 --> 04:16.625
Only once actually they made conquering war during the Alexander time, during the times of Alexander.

04:17.366 --> 04:23.873
Yet through his conquering he wasn't killing people unless they were very much resisting him.

04:24.153 --> 04:27.216
Usually he was accepted and he spread

04:27.601 --> 04:35.990
Hellenism, which eventually became a vessel for the gospel, which was written in Greek and spread in the Greek language, etc., etc.

04:36.010 --> 04:42.636
So were people of peace, were the Turks, were people of violence, because this is how it was their culture.

04:43.037 --> 04:46.280
They were shepherds, and then they became bandits.

04:47.401 --> 04:51.065
And then they saw Byzantium, ooh, why don't we sit on their throne?

04:51.806 --> 04:57.051
And they managed to do that with the help of Martin and the Western

04:57.638 --> 05:09.571
powers, especially from the 13th century, when the Franks, Western Europeans, came and conquered Byzantium and made a big crash.

05:10.512 --> 05:22.805
And after that, although Byzantium still was elevated in the theology, the arts, et cetera, the military was very small, and the Ottomans came and conquered the whole thing.

05:22.825 --> 05:25.468
And that's 1453 when it fell.

05:25.702 --> 05:33.372
They came, the Franks conquered the Crusaders, you know, the fiasco of Crusaders.

05:33.532 --> 05:47.490
They conquered in 1204, Constantinople, and they left in 1261, and there was another two centuries of glory of Basantium, but as I said, military was very, very weak.

05:47.911 --> 05:52.857
They lost all the provinces, and so it was easy for their Turks to come in.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.839
And then there was no crusaders to help the Constantinople.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.963
They lost their will for that, didn't they?

06:00.983 --> 06:03.367
That looks like a very old trunk there.

06:03.467 --> 06:07.032
Yes, we have many of these.

06:07.172 --> 06:10.877
Usually here we find many, we discover many treasures.

06:11.358 --> 06:16.585
And now I don't know whether we have anything in it.

06:16.606 --> 06:18.388
Oh, well, we have a lot of...

06:18.723 --> 06:38.318
maps, we are collecting all kinds of maps we have here because we have maps from the 19th, 18th century and in many languages, all kinds of languages and we know that people appreciate it very much because we have, especially after the collapse of the Soviet

06:38.534 --> 06:41.400
Big changes, you know, with boundaries.

06:41.620 --> 06:42.342
That's exactly right.

06:42.502 --> 06:50.479
That is why some Americans came and they photographed the oldest geography of Ptolemy, which we have here, which I will show you.

06:51.301 --> 06:52.984
And they photographed the whole thing.

06:53.846 --> 06:59.698
And then two weeks, the three small Lithuania, Estonia, and Letonia,

07:00.590 --> 07:01.912
they make a revolution.

07:01.932 --> 07:09.801
And many of the fathers here say, hmm, there might be something there CIA perhaps.

07:09.821 --> 07:10.182
Who knows?

07:10.402 --> 07:11.704
Who knows?

07:11.724 --> 07:20.955
Anyway, so these are the Romanian archives, which are now studied by a Rumanologist, as we call him.

07:22.077 --> 07:23.398
He's a professor in Athens.

07:24.460 --> 07:26.462
He's half Greek and Romanian.

07:27.168 --> 07:33.076
and he lives in Athens for many years with two of his graduate students.

07:33.096 --> 07:34.198
They're making a very good work.

07:34.739 --> 07:45.073
They are now translating them in modern Greek and of course then we have to have them in English for all the experts.

07:46.375 --> 07:55.808
The language usually is either Slavic or Romanian or

07:56.362 --> 08:02.912
And some of them, some of them, which we included in the Romanian archive, they come even from Tsars.

08:02.932 --> 08:09.181
But we said, let's put together, since they are Flavonics and Romanian, let's make them one team.

08:10.283 --> 08:19.476
But because most of it, the majority are Romanian, from princes of, around the principalities of Danube.

08:20.197 --> 08:25.525
Before Romania became a big country, last century, it was

08:25.741 --> 08:28.904
Transylvania, Moldavia, and Vlahia.

08:30.386 --> 08:38.114
And these three principalities were very much helping these monasteries, especially, as well as other monasteries, but very much these monasteries.

08:38.495 --> 08:40.817
That is why the Romanians, they don't have their own monastery.

08:41.118 --> 08:48.526
They have three skates, but they don't have their own monastery, yet for them, Vatopelli is their own monastery.

08:49.387 --> 08:51.849
And you can see the continuation of this tradition.

08:51.869 --> 08:54.212
We have six Romanian fathers in the monastery.

08:56.842 --> 08:59.164
Here's six.

08:59.184 --> 08:59.645
Okay.

09:00.946 --> 09:02.348
And many others who want to come.

09:04.089 --> 09:07.493
Now here are documents, documents, documents.

09:07.853 --> 09:14.100
Also documents which are more contemporary with the so-called metohia.

09:14.640 --> 09:26.072
Metohia is a word for properties which were given as a gift by pious Christians to monasteries in order so that it will become a source of

09:26.373 --> 09:55.215
income for the monks since the monks cannot work outside and have their own money since they are dealing with praying and worshipping God and things like that in order to help them to have people come and work and build or do other things to find source of income I used people to reach and grow up they used to give the land or they used to give a lake or

09:55.988 --> 10:06.784
animals, houses, real estate, things like that.

10:07.305 --> 10:08.987
And these are the deeds, the documents.

10:09.268 --> 10:09.969
Exactly.

10:09.989 --> 10:11.190
Unfortunately, many are lost.

10:11.972 --> 10:14.295
Because they go back many, many centuries.

10:14.355 --> 10:20.524
Also because of the so-called catastrophe of Hellenism in Minor Asia.

10:21.345 --> 10:24.510
We still call it Minor Asia, as you can see.

10:24.676 --> 10:36.511
in 1922, when the Turks eliminated almost all the Greeks, killing them or just sending them away when they came to Greece.

10:37.752 --> 10:42.939
These people, thousands and thousands of people, came here without anything.

10:42.959 --> 10:52.050
I went to a village outside of Ephesus last week, a beautiful little village, and up on the top of the hill are two Greek churches.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.623
And they're abandoned, and there isn't a single Greek in the town.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.345
The churches are still there.

10:58.246 --> 10:59.929
But I said, gee, are there any Greeks around?

11:00.610 --> 11:01.972
Not the Greek community of God.

11:02.132 --> 11:12.687
The prophets are saying that pretty soon, since the Turkish nation was established of blood, it's going to be wiped out with blood.

11:13.608 --> 11:18.595
It's the divine justice which balances and controls everything.

11:19.807 --> 11:35.148
And so we know people who have told us, Turks, who have told us that when the feast of that travel, which is completely deserted, and there are no Greeks around the area, in the night we see lights and we hear chanting.

11:35.288 --> 11:36.850
We go there and we see nothing.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.973
We come back again, we see the same thing.

11:39.914 --> 11:47.484
This is a proof that Vizatim is still alive there.

11:47.504 --> 11:48.025
And...

11:48.460 --> 11:54.530
One of the reasons why the Turks are so aggressive is because they know that they are not in their own house.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.154
They're sitting on somebody else's seat.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.736
That makes them nervous, as you know.

11:58.756 --> 11:59.157
It should.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.706
So here, as we see, documents, document, documents.

12:05.186 --> 12:06.529
So this is now the second floor?

12:06.789 --> 12:08.271
This is the basement.

12:08.392 --> 12:09.093
Oh, this is the basement.

12:09.153 --> 12:13.940
This is the one we were... The first, then we're going to go to the second and the third.

12:15.082 --> 12:15.683
There is a top floor.

12:18.430 --> 12:23.598
Yes, our grandfather Joseph the Hissihast, who I mentioned.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.259
Yes.

12:24.279 --> 12:42.345
And he is the root, our Abraham, of our, of Vatoperi, Dionysiu, Philotheou Caracallou Custamonitou, Xyropotamou, six, yes.

12:42.612 --> 12:44.074
What are his dates, his years?

12:44.354 --> 13:10.169
He lived between, he was born in 1898 in the island of Paros and died in 1959 at the New Skit on the other side of the office with our father Joseph also, Joseph of Vatateri.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.050
Do you have one?

13:11.300 --> 13:12.201
a hospital?

13:12.742 --> 13:14.043
I'll show you.

13:14.523 --> 13:15.965
It's next to this tower.

13:15.985 --> 13:16.926
Sorry, you don't have to show me.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.788
I just wondered if monks get sick.

13:18.828 --> 13:34.785
We had a hospital here because the monastery was big and people from the cells could come here or from the skits and we still also today there were always some monks who knew medicine.

13:35.186 --> 13:36.127
They could apply to that.

13:36.727 --> 13:38.269
Of course today we have

13:38.688 --> 13:40.330
development in medicine.

13:40.731 --> 13:43.134
It's going to return.

13:43.174 --> 13:46.458
They are changing the... We have generators.

13:46.819 --> 13:47.960
And we use them.

13:48.241 --> 13:51.124
We use different monies, different denies.

13:51.144 --> 13:53.888
It depends also on what we are working.

13:54.449 --> 13:59.576
It's a big monastery, one kilometer perimetre.

13:59.596 --> 14:08.307
We have discovered in manuscripts 8,800 monks in Byzantine times.

14:09.907 --> 14:19.757
And now we are doing the monastery in such a... So you discovered eight hundred monks... Eight hundred, but there were times that there were hundreds of monks here, even eight hundred.

14:20.358 --> 14:24.202
As many as... As many as eight hundred, exactly, in the Byzantine times.

14:25.263 --> 14:39.458
And from this monastery Hilandara came, because the Serbian king Simeon and his son Prince Savas, the two greatest saints of Serbia, of the Serbian church, became monks here.

14:39.961 --> 14:43.044
Whereas their queen became a nun in Serbia.

14:43.064 --> 14:46.087
And then an influx of Serbian monks followed them.

14:46.988 --> 14:48.730
And they wanted to make their own monastery.

14:49.231 --> 14:52.594
And Vatopedi gave them a property of their own.

14:53.195 --> 14:54.076
And they made Hilandar.

14:54.576 --> 14:57.960
And so Hilandar is a daughter of Vatopedi.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.142
Also, we lost many of these properties.

15:00.323 --> 15:04.567
I didn't finish it in 1922 when we gave it to all these refugees.

15:04.967 --> 15:08.331
Especially we had a lot of property in Khalkidiki.

15:08.665 --> 15:14.554
The area around, you know, Cassandra, the Three Legs, and around Thessalonica, all this area.

15:15.255 --> 15:22.445
And we had many properties, and the fathers, due to the emergency, they just gave the whole land to the people.

15:22.465 --> 15:27.773
The government promised to give us money, and we're still waiting for it.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.856
You know, we governments.

15:29.876 --> 15:34.403
Every government when it comes to money.

15:34.957 --> 15:36.078
You did that on the way down.

15:36.619 --> 15:39.381
I should have warned you.

15:39.501 --> 15:40.062
No, that's fine.

15:40.082 --> 15:40.983
I've got a strong head.

15:41.183 --> 15:42.204
I have.

15:42.224 --> 15:47.169
In my first year, when I became a monk here, I so many times bumped my head.

15:47.189 --> 15:52.013
And if you used to be... Let's hold on here today.

15:52.334 --> 15:52.674
Yes, sir.

15:53.295 --> 15:54.596
You can sit on the items.

15:54.616 --> 15:54.956
Look at these.

15:54.976 --> 15:55.757
Marvelous, sir.

15:55.777 --> 15:56.558
Yes, it is.

15:56.578 --> 15:57.479
Oh, yes.

15:57.499 --> 16:04.305
And even here, you will see also... I have a question for you, Father.

16:04.842 --> 16:09.907
Are these inscribed pieces of stone, are they considered manuscripts?

16:10.748 --> 16:13.050
Not manuscripts, are they considered documents in a way?

16:14.872 --> 16:19.316
Yes, of course, because they are giving us information on writing.

16:19.336 --> 16:23.060
It doesn't have to be papyrus and parchment, it might be marble.

16:23.220 --> 16:30.827
This is pertinent to my new book as well, because I'm dealing with technology, the changing nature of information transmission.

16:31.308 --> 16:32.689
For example, over here you see,

16:33.665 --> 16:42.893
These are from Hellenistic, even classical Athens, 4th century BC, the death, the mourning of the dead lord of the house.

16:43.634 --> 16:48.719
And this is a sign, a symbol that his life has finished and he's going to another life.

16:49.399 --> 17:03.672
Because the ancient Greeks saw that man, in order to add a few things to what Father Athenius didn't say to you, they saw that man has conscience, choosing, willingness, memory, and many other things that animals possess.

17:04.158 --> 17:11.208
they realize that these things are things that are qualities of an emotional being.

17:11.228 --> 17:21.001
And that is why this means, according to an expert who told us a few years ago, his life on the earth is finished and he's going into another one.

17:21.021 --> 17:25.387
So are these here because they're beautiful or because they transmit information?

17:25.447 --> 17:29.733
It's because the fathers discovered them here and there.

17:30.073 --> 17:33.658
There were six good scenes on Athos

17:35.292 --> 17:42.901
according to historians like Herodotus and others, which you will find in books.

17:42.941 --> 17:45.004
So this goes back to classical and Hellenic.

17:45.024 --> 17:47.326
Classical and Romans.

17:47.346 --> 17:48.848
You can see Roman times as well.

17:49.609 --> 17:52.052
And these were found here.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.876
Yes, they were found here, and we placed them here.

17:55.896 --> 18:04.827
Lately, just a few weeks ago, we discovered big jars in our garden while we were at Ford.

18:05.161 --> 18:08.707
Yes, something like that, bacon, amphores.

18:09.689 --> 18:16.220
Pythos is more than amphores, you know, it's something like this, but we're talking about huge... It's just salmon after all these centuries.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.006
Yes, from the Hellenistic time, according to the expert who came here.

18:20.207 --> 18:23.192
And so now we're not going to use that for the garden.

18:23.352 --> 18:30.865
We're making new plantations because we're becoming more and more people, more and more guests, and we want to have

18:31.368 --> 18:36.293
you know, using organic gardening and things like that, and we want to expand.

18:36.774 --> 18:39.116
But every now and then we discover something archaeological.

18:40.378 --> 18:43.761
Who are the guys, the monks?

18:43.781 --> 18:53.172
The monks, ourselves, and of course we have some workers who are coming now from the ex-Soviet Union.

18:54.113 --> 18:55.414
Do they live here in Athos?

18:55.434 --> 18:58.698
They live with us, and if they behave, they stay with us.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.020
Sometimes they don't, they get kicked out.

19:01.439 --> 19:07.689
It's not easy to stay, especially for young men, to stay in a place where there's no TV entertainment.

19:08.790 --> 19:09.852
Let's just leave it at that.

19:10.072 --> 19:19.587
There are a few, though, who are clever, and they become baptized here, because although their countries were traditionally orthodox due to communism, they were above them.

19:19.847 --> 19:26.237
And look how strongly orthodoxists come back to Russia.

19:26.257 --> 19:27.058
I was told...

19:27.443 --> 19:33.368
Two, three years ago, by some priests who are also professors in the Academy of St.

19:33.388 --> 19:41.876
Sergius in Moscow, 400 monasteries in a few years have been filled with monks and nuns.

19:42.557 --> 19:45.059
And they are making more and more and more and more.

19:45.079 --> 19:47.741
Can you describe briefly some of the things that are here?

19:47.761 --> 19:47.861
Yes.

19:48.262 --> 19:56.269
Here we have a couple of showcases in order to demonstrate to the people, representatively if I may say so,

19:57.532 --> 20:01.678
Here we have from our collection which we said is 2050 manuscripts.

20:02.199 --> 20:04.362
By the way we are still discovering manuscripts.

20:04.382 --> 20:06.425
Now where do you discover them when you say you discover them?

20:06.546 --> 20:13.676
We are discovering because we may discover it when an old father from the previous world who dies, he has many books.

20:14.037 --> 20:19.425
We go and we collect the books and half of the book is handwritten.

20:20.547 --> 20:26.796
Or a book is a pure manuscript of the 17th century, of the 16th century.

20:27.113 --> 20:56.125
we may discover while looking at the books we are newcomers by the way only eight years in this monastery only eight years now who's newcomers now we we were at the the brotherhood was at the new street where joseph de hisi has died i see and then became about 15 20 people and then they were asked to come here because there were only few old monks here in the 60s in 63

20:56.476 --> 21:02.086
we had the millennium of Monathos, actually the millennium of Lavra, but they said of the whole Monathos.

21:02.406 --> 21:15.609
And the people who came here, many prestigious people, patriarchs, kings, etc., they were saying that we're actually doing the funeral of Monathos, because there were only less... During the funeral of this?

21:15.689 --> 21:21.960
Yes, they were also doing the funeral of this, quote-unquote, because there were less than 700 monks,

21:22.244 --> 21:26.733
And the average age was 60 years old, something like that.

21:26.793 --> 21:27.956
This was of all of us?

21:28.156 --> 21:29.679
Yes, that was of all of us.

21:29.699 --> 21:30.781
So it was down to 700.

21:30.801 --> 21:35.431
700, and the age was very... And this is in the 60s?

21:35.451 --> 21:36.112
In the 60s.

21:36.132 --> 21:38.036
It's about 2,000 now, isn't it?

21:38.056 --> 21:41.383
Now it's 2,000, and the average age, as you have seen, is...

21:41.617 --> 21:43.380
25, may I say?

21:43.720 --> 21:49.469
I wrote this down four times in my notebook today, how young these men are.

21:49.489 --> 22:00.206
You will find young men in monasteries, if you go like, for example, see Monopetra, Grigoriou, the monastery that you will see, Vion, Lavra, you will see a lot of young people.

22:00.226 --> 22:02.309
So you say the new brotherhood, you came from which?

22:02.349 --> 22:04.032
From the new skeet.

22:04.512 --> 22:07.557
It's a skeet which belongs to the monastery of St.

22:07.777 --> 22:08.198
Paul.

22:09.072 --> 22:09.813
And that is where St.

22:10.975 --> 22:13.218
Joseph de Hesihas... And it's called the New Skeet.

22:13.238 --> 22:13.959
New Skeet.

22:13.979 --> 22:14.840
That's its name.

22:15.201 --> 22:15.782
New.

22:15.942 --> 22:16.523
N-E-W.

22:16.943 --> 22:17.144
New.

22:17.384 --> 22:18.566
Something which is new.

22:18.606 --> 22:20.849
Because it was newer than the other ones.

22:20.909 --> 22:23.032
And it was at the... It's near St.

22:23.132 --> 22:25.776
Paul's Monastery on the other side of the peninsula.

22:28.080 --> 22:28.600
There St.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.563
Joseph de Hesihas died in 59.

22:31.384 --> 22:38.775
And one of his students, our Joseph, the Vatopendian,

22:39.143 --> 22:43.510
made his own brotherhood, and eventually they came here.

22:44.211 --> 22:50.802
And they assumed, not assumed, but they... The Patriot for Santinople.

22:51.523 --> 23:02.721
And the Holy Community, which is the government of the Lord Athos, decided to bestow the power to the new brotherhood of Father Joseph of Antipati.

23:03.308 --> 23:07.174
because the old monks were unable to run these monasteries.

23:07.194 --> 23:10.720
There were about 10 and they were 70 years old, many of them.

23:10.740 --> 23:11.861
Now we have only two of them.

23:12.142 --> 23:12.883
All of them are gone.

23:13.604 --> 23:13.985
They died.

23:14.025 --> 23:18.732
And this is really responsible for this dynamic.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.857
It sent Joseph to the Hissi house.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.310
as well as his energiosity.

23:24.390 --> 23:31.937
But the attitude that is... They projected this whole dynamism is the word you used earlier.

23:32.017 --> 23:33.318
Yes, dynamismos.

23:33.518 --> 23:43.488
It's something, and the statistics, as I said before, about the millennium and the funeral, etc., they said that you are doing the funeral.

23:43.528 --> 23:51.355
Well, Athos we should, maybe, the Junta in 67 was thinking to

23:52.229 --> 24:10.256
pull all the monks in one monastery, one of the big monasteries maybe, and turn the rest of the monasteries, museums, hotels, things like that, and make it a forest for hunting for their royalties and for the VIPs and the presidents of the countries and things like that.

24:10.296 --> 24:15.203
But they didn't count that there is a lady here, a governess.

24:15.223 --> 24:15.624
A woman.

24:16.264 --> 24:18.628
A Virgin Mary, the only woman who can come here.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.392
From the 70s,

24:21.676 --> 24:23.558
Suddenly, we have a reverse.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.421
The hunter is gone.

24:26.461 --> 24:28.923
The hunter is gone, yes.

24:28.943 --> 24:29.684
Number one.

24:29.704 --> 24:31.726
Number one.

24:32.006 --> 24:42.616
The thing is that young men, most of them, the graduates, professionals, they came with having full knowledge of what they were going to do.

24:43.297 --> 24:49.303
Sacrifice their whole life and their whole personality in order to come here and service God.

24:49.604 --> 24:50.305
in the church.

24:51.606 --> 24:54.390
Did the Junta really seriously propose doing this?

24:54.670 --> 24:55.792
It was one of the ideas.

24:56.112 --> 24:57.934
They tossed it out?

24:58.154 --> 24:59.877
Yeah, so to speak, they tossed it out.

24:59.937 --> 25:03.761
Just to see, like we call it a trial balloon, see how people respond.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.244
Let's see how people respond, exactly.

25:06.885 --> 25:09.949
Also, others was, we had also another thing.

25:10.590 --> 25:19.020
A gentleman came, I remember, some years ago, and he said to the fathers here, I would like to make a hotel here,

25:19.237 --> 25:26.149
and I can give you a lot of money, and we can make it a special hotel, Byzantine hotel, you know, things like that.

25:26.169 --> 25:27.231
See, they don't understand.

25:27.271 --> 25:30.777
But they don't understand what's going on here.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.161
It's like we say back home, they don't get it.

25:33.762 --> 25:37.709
Even the people in Greece, they didn't understand Mao's house.

25:37.729 --> 25:43.860
Because there was this disruption due to the Turkish occupation, ignorance,

25:44.600 --> 25:49.445
There was a turn towards the technology and science of Western Europe.

25:51.628 --> 25:54.691
So what attracts the special person who comes here?

25:54.852 --> 25:55.652
Divine grace.

25:56.874 --> 25:58.496
You answered that immediately.

25:58.516 --> 25:58.996
Nothing else.

25:59.437 --> 26:02.340
Because if it is not divine, there is nothing else for us here.

26:02.860 --> 26:11.350
We have no money, no property, no pleasures, no our own family, which is something very natural.

26:11.532 --> 26:14.196
We didn't hate our family and we came here.

26:14.376 --> 26:15.198
You loved yourself.

26:15.218 --> 26:19.204
We loved them and we prayed for them more than we would do outside.

26:19.324 --> 26:21.728
And they have benefited most of them.

26:22.068 --> 26:26.255
Usually the first people who benefit are relatives, spiritually speaking.

26:27.176 --> 26:31.342
And we came out of love for God and His Mother.

26:32.524 --> 26:36.370
And we stay here because they provide us divine grace.

26:37.191 --> 26:38.974
The energies of the Holy Spirit.

26:41.165 --> 26:44.349
Because here, as you can see, we wake up at 3.30.

26:45.531 --> 26:48.955
And we work without being paid.

26:49.496 --> 26:50.757
There's no vacations.

26:51.438 --> 26:55.523
We cannot travel or do whatever we like without the permission of the abbot.

26:56.885 --> 27:02.192
And, of course, by being obedient, that doesn't mean that we have lost our freedom.

27:02.552 --> 27:07.999
No, we are seeking freedom, the spiritual freedom, the freedom from our passion.

27:08.755 --> 27:11.138
Look at the freedom that people are talking about today.

27:11.158 --> 27:12.880
They say, I want to be free.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.821
Do whatever I like.

27:14.782 --> 27:18.667
You're doing whatever your passion is telling you to do, usually.

27:19.468 --> 27:27.677
Here we're trying to halt this passion.

27:27.737 --> 27:31.742
How long have you welcomed pilgrims like myself to come?

27:32.313 --> 27:34.897
Have you always welcomed people to come?

27:34.957 --> 27:35.418
Of course.

27:36.139 --> 27:39.644
Because the people built the monasteries together with the kings.

27:40.265 --> 27:43.690
The people give the taxation and the people came and worked for this.

27:43.991 --> 27:48.437
Of course the kings were the overseers and they make the plans and the decisions and things like that.

27:49.018 --> 27:52.163
But the people... So it belongs to the people?

27:52.363 --> 27:54.366
It belongs to the Orthodox people.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.187
Obviously.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.169
Obviously.

27:56.409 --> 28:00.936
But also to the rest of the people because we welcome anyone who might come here.

28:01.304 --> 28:09.072
And as you can see, we have fathers here who were non-orthodox, became orthodox here, and then became monks.

28:09.092 --> 28:14.959
And also we have a lot of foreigners, let's call them foreigners, because we don't like this.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.241
We see humanity as one.

28:18.423 --> 28:20.785
Like Adam was one family.

28:20.845 --> 28:22.407
We are actually one family.

28:22.427 --> 28:26.491
And especially after Christ came here from Pentecost, we are one.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.775
Okay, I am Greek and he is...

28:30.110 --> 28:39.922
Italian, and he's Russian, and he's English, etc., etc., but, and other attributes, the language, and other differences, but we have one common thing, faith.

28:40.463 --> 28:46.951
And this is a model here, please underline, model, of a republic, a real republic.

28:47.071 --> 28:58.665
We are so many people, 2,000 people, coming from all kinds of countries, even from Brazil, Chile, let me think, another...

28:59.810 --> 29:07.539
remote place, like England, or like Africa, just name it, Australia, Africa.

29:07.699 --> 29:10.883
Do you have some black people here?

29:11.203 --> 29:29.445
They don't stay with us, they go back to continue their missionary work, but they come to us, Orthodox, from Africa, and they spend time with us, they become priests, then they go back and they continue their work, they build churches, parishes, even communities, monastic communities lately.

29:29.847 --> 29:33.791
since we have a revival here on Athens.

29:33.831 --> 29:43.681
And now all these people are together, they are different in so many things, yet they have one common thing, faith, the gospel.

29:43.701 --> 29:46.383
And because of that, they are united.

29:46.403 --> 29:49.086
Of course, you will hear, ah, we have chorus.

29:49.106 --> 29:52.089
Okay, in every family we have chorus and differences, things like that.

29:52.109 --> 29:57.154
But still, whatever differences might be, we are all well together.

29:57.387 --> 30:14.688
Someone may say, yes, but you have a Russian monastery, and you have a Bulgarian monastery, and you have a Serbian monastery, and you have Romanian skits, and Iviro was Georgian, Iviro, Georgian actually, it was, now it's, I, it's, people there who live up mostly weeks.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.591
Yes, these are historical reasons.

30:18.372 --> 30:26.922
It's because of the Turkish occupation, and they wanted to make it strong in order to be

30:27.290 --> 30:30.014
not to have a dominion, the Turkish rule.

30:31.476 --> 30:35.141
But as you can see in our monastery now, we have a mosaic of people.

30:35.161 --> 30:39.007
And this is happening in other monasteries, if you visit them.

30:39.367 --> 30:42.212
When you go to Trivia, you will find a British.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.757
If you go to see Monogatari, you will find French and Germans.

30:46.458 --> 30:53.007
If you go in, let me think, here, you will find Romanians, Brazilians, the Czech.

30:55.090 --> 30:56.993
Of course, the majority is still Greek.

30:57.445 --> 31:03.472
Because, as we said before, somehow God has given the leadership to the Greeks.

31:04.293 --> 31:07.857
And I'm not saying this out of Shoveghism.

31:07.877 --> 31:17.448
It's God's plan, as He worked in the very beginning with the people of Israel, then the succession of the apostles was with fathers.

31:19.450 --> 31:26.338
And they were, of course, also called Romans only, because they became all of the Roman sinners.

31:26.622 --> 31:29.586
Because Romans or Greeks was the same thing.

31:30.007 --> 31:31.129
There was a distinction.

31:31.169 --> 31:36.977
The distinction was made later on for politics, with the theism and things like that.

31:37.017 --> 31:38.519
Behind this is politics.

31:38.539 --> 31:42.345
So there are Charles Marlous, you know, the Holy Roman Empire.

31:42.886 --> 31:51.478
They tried to make an empire so that their real Roman Empire, Byzantium, would be slowly, slowly wiped out.

31:52.239 --> 31:54.002
And Roman Catholicism came up.

31:55.003 --> 31:56.325
It didn't happen, thank goodness.

31:57.217 --> 31:58.899
So, let's go back to some of these.

31:58.919 --> 32:02.124
Okay, here we have a few from our collection.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.547
This is a geography of Ptolemy.

32:04.567 --> 32:09.573
It was taken out in the exhibition in Celerica last year.

32:10.094 --> 32:13.539
It is the oldest copy.

32:13.559 --> 32:23.612
The original was done, of course, as you know better than I do, in the second century BC in Alexandria by Ptolemy.

32:24.132 --> 32:28.556
And this copies the oldest, 13th century.

32:28.596 --> 32:47.374
And the monk used the, in order to draw all the maps, he used the, I don't know how you call it in English, the parameters, the numberings of the globe.

32:47.394 --> 32:48.135
Meridians.

32:48.155 --> 32:49.997
Meridians, parameters.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.818
Longitude, latitude.

32:51.838 --> 32:53.700
That's it, that's it.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.933
I understand what you mean.

32:55.953 --> 32:57.716
I don't remember this one.

32:57.736 --> 32:59.178
I have to look at the dictionary.

32:59.739 --> 33:08.131
So he did it, and as you can see, it is very... We have just printed it, by the way.

33:08.151 --> 33:09.593
Sufeximoid copies, yes.

33:09.613 --> 33:17.524
Yes, we have made also a copy, which I don't know whether we are sending this, because it was just been published a few days ago.

33:17.564 --> 33:20.869
And here you can see Middle East.

33:22.486 --> 33:28.496
since the Orient has somehow the beginning of the civilization, we usually have this page.

33:28.897 --> 33:30.960
This was in the Thessaloniki exhibit.

33:30.980 --> 33:31.421
Exactly.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.408
From... what was it?

33:35.428 --> 33:39.114
It was August of... I bought the book, so it'll be in there.

33:39.134 --> 33:40.356
Okay.

33:40.376 --> 33:45.445
It has about... how many maps?

33:45.465 --> 33:46.366
Of the three continents.

33:46.386 --> 33:46.967
That's fine, yeah.

33:46.987 --> 33:48.730
You know, North America or...

33:49.216 --> 33:50.137
It's not known yet.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.080
I don't remember the number of the maps.

33:52.100 --> 33:52.600
Is it 40?

33:53.321 --> 33:54.262
You will find it in the book.

33:54.282 --> 33:54.863
I have the book.

33:54.883 --> 33:55.724
You have the book, okay.

33:56.365 --> 33:59.929
And we have everything there, except two pages written.

34:00.450 --> 34:01.732
The British stole them.

34:03.113 --> 34:08.720
But they're in the British Museum, and in our edition, we added these two pages.

34:09.321 --> 34:13.226
And now we're about to make an exhibition worldwide, which we haven't talked.

34:13.246 --> 34:17.451
We will talk about that later on, because I'm going to give you a lot of information.

34:17.701 --> 34:20.606
It wouldn't be the right time to tell you about this.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.510
We're going to have an exhibition, maybe even in New York.

34:23.530 --> 34:23.951
Really?

34:23.971 --> 34:26.956
Yes, with things from here.

34:26.976 --> 34:28.178
Is Vatopedi or apples?

34:28.218 --> 34:28.779
Vatopedi.

34:29.039 --> 34:40.478
Vatopedi, as well as relics from Vatopedi, which are now in museums and libraries in the whole world, like Dabarton, Ongs, the mosaic portable icon of St.

34:40.498 --> 34:45.025
John Chrysostom, or like a lot of, in Moscow, Hermitage,

34:45.562 --> 34:48.145
That was a landmark.

34:48.165 --> 35:02.123
So we're going to bring those which are outside of Adoferi, and now we're trying our best, it's not easy, this is in the process, to get also a few from here, but a few and very special, very, very special.

35:02.223 --> 35:02.683
Remarkable.

35:02.703 --> 35:04.185
Which haven't been exposed.

35:04.285 --> 35:05.927
And where was this done?

35:06.048 --> 35:10.934
This was done in the 13th century, and by a monk, as I said.

35:10.994 --> 35:11.214
Here?

35:11.574 --> 35:11.895
Here.

35:12.395 --> 35:14.438
The second part of this

35:14.536 --> 35:24.209
codex is the geographical information by Strabon, who lived in the first century AD.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.852
He was a Cretan, but he lived in Rome.

35:26.872 --> 35:30.317
That's why most people think that he's Latin, but he was a Cretan.

35:30.757 --> 35:31.538
No, I know him.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.882
I quote him in my book, which I'm sending out.

35:34.783 --> 35:43.294
And so here you have a perfect geography of antiquity and medieval times for military purposes.

35:43.426 --> 35:46.510
for governmental purposes, etc., etc.

35:47.952 --> 35:49.214
It is very, very important.

35:49.234 --> 35:49.955
Unbelievable.

35:50.475 --> 36:00.008
Here from the same century, 13th century, the first eight books of the Old Testament, and it's called Okta Tefk.

36:00.028 --> 36:01.430
Okta Tefk.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.611
You know this.

36:02.631 --> 36:03.532
It's a term.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.558
Beautiful illuminations, 153 miniatures.

36:08.519 --> 36:09.640
How many miniatures?

36:09.660 --> 36:10.902
153.

36:11.405 --> 36:14.330
It is all, I think this is also in the book.

36:14.831 --> 36:19.819
If it is not, you will write to me and I will give you additional information because now I don't have everything in my head.

36:20.700 --> 36:30.115
And we have the text and commentaries by the Fathers and beautiful illumination, 700 years old, and you can see how beautiful they are.

36:31.678 --> 36:38.509
This is probably the most beautiful illustrated manuscript of our collection of manuscripts here.

36:41.392 --> 36:47.138
No, in this book, the Octateth, you would suggest is the most beautiful.

36:47.258 --> 37:00.751
Yes, this is not only my own experience, it's also I've heard experts, Byzantinologists who came here, and they said, this is magnificent.

37:01.732 --> 37:02.633
I can't remember.

37:02.793 --> 37:05.116
Maybe.

37:05.136 --> 37:06.997
But this will be in the book I've got today.

37:07.158 --> 37:07.618
Yes.

37:07.784 --> 37:10.006
If it's not in the one book, it's going to be in the other.

37:10.046 --> 37:12.168
But I think also that one went out.

37:12.188 --> 37:12.869
I think so.

37:13.149 --> 37:15.812
We send a lot of relics because we have so many.

37:16.212 --> 37:18.254
We were quite rich in that.

37:18.715 --> 37:23.560
Now, 11th century, four Gospels.

37:23.580 --> 37:24.521
Tetra Evangelion.

37:25.101 --> 37:27.604
Tetra, cuatro, four.

37:28.144 --> 37:29.566
11th century.

37:30.266 --> 37:35.051
Here you can see also beautiful miniature of Mark.

37:35.071 --> 37:37.133
And here is the beginning of the Gospel.

37:37.282 --> 37:39.004
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

37:40.766 --> 37:43.709
That's gold with lapis lazuli.

37:43.769 --> 37:46.933
This is 900 years old.

37:47.233 --> 37:49.155
They were using and believing.

37:49.335 --> 37:57.765
We have some other cosmos with absolutely so perfect manuscripts that you would say, this is childish.

37:58.986 --> 37:59.927
Believe me.

37:59.947 --> 38:01.189
But I cannot take you there.

38:01.529 --> 38:07.035
It's a treasury and you have to have the board has to sign and things like that.

38:07.538 --> 38:10.801
Maybe next time... Everything takes time.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.623
You know, it will cooperate more and more.

38:12.904 --> 38:16.707
You will gain the trust of the boat here, and they will give you... I totally understand.

38:16.727 --> 38:19.090
And they will ask you to go there.

38:19.110 --> 38:20.932
This is a great treat right here.

38:21.252 --> 38:25.256
I am grateful for everything that you're doing now.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.640
I believe that the Virgin has brought you here.

38:28.780 --> 38:33.765
I can see some more things behind all this.

38:34.488 --> 38:38.963
I can see the blessing of the Virgin to you and to your family.

38:40.613 --> 38:43.716
You probably have some artists up there who wanted you to come here.

38:44.316 --> 38:45.057
I think so.

38:45.177 --> 38:47.539
It was my first choice, you know.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.783
I was in the square yesterday and they were talking about the close monasteries.

38:51.423 --> 38:53.525
And I just said, I want to go to Vagopedi first.

38:53.545 --> 38:54.846
They said, but that's too far away.

38:54.886 --> 38:57.529
Nobody would drive me out here.

38:57.709 --> 39:02.333
Yes, it's due to the sea with the rock.

39:02.634 --> 39:06.717
I stayed in a little monastery near the square and then I came out this morning.

39:06.737 --> 39:07.418
But here we are.

39:07.839 --> 39:08.359
So it's...

39:08.812 --> 39:12.717
It was quite strange how we left together, you know.

39:12.978 --> 39:13.498
You were there.

39:14.139 --> 39:18.345
And you know, at that time, on Sundays, I'm never out of my cell.

39:18.525 --> 39:21.469
I'm usually in my cell praying and reading the Father's.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.793
But it happened... It's remarkable.

39:23.813 --> 39:36.811
...that I had to do something, and then it happened that you didn't give your paper at the dog, ma'am, and it happened that somebody said to me, hey, please, you know English, help this man, and et cetera, et cetera.

39:36.831 --> 39:37.211
Amazing.

39:37.512 --> 39:37.772
No.

39:37.988 --> 39:39.830
Another gospel.

39:39.850 --> 39:41.733
This is a liturgical gospel.

39:42.273 --> 39:44.797
It's a gospel which is used for the services.

39:46.579 --> 39:53.608
That means it tells to the priest when to read on the feast of the Domitian of Our Lady Theotokos on Paschal Day.

39:54.549 --> 40:01.518
So it's the four gospels, but in certain pieces for the certain day.

40:02.198 --> 40:05.903
Fourteenth century, and you can see there are many illuminations.

40:06.490 --> 40:07.972
Breathtaking, breathtaking.

40:08.713 --> 40:18.105
You know, I should remember if you... this exhibition, the Getty Library has some... Oh!

40:18.125 --> 40:23.612
Well, it seems we're getting these to the meat of the whole thing.

40:23.632 --> 40:24.633
Fourteenth century.

40:27.837 --> 40:28.338
Oh, my pen.

40:28.939 --> 40:30.621
And here we have some illumination.

40:31.502 --> 40:32.143
Christmas.

40:32.528 --> 40:39.475
It's become also a postcard, by the way, postcard, and it's very... the Friends of all of us have used it.

40:42.117 --> 40:57.132
Matthew, you can see the gold, shining, which means the uncreated energies of God, what we call grace, which is what the Holy Spirit gave to the apostles and to all the Christians by their baptism.

40:57.993 --> 41:00.595
And we have it potentially, potentially,

41:01.064 --> 41:06.289
And we will become energized if we follow Christ and His commandments.

41:06.309 --> 41:14.136
And then we will become like kings, which is the sole purpose of man's existence, to become a god by grace.

41:14.856 --> 41:16.518
And this, again, you said is what century?

41:16.578 --> 41:17.259
This is fourteen?

41:17.279 --> 41:18.340
Fourteenth century.

41:18.780 --> 41:24.645
A highlight of theology, by the way, theology and arts.

41:24.665 --> 41:26.887
Although it was only one century before its fall.

41:27.648 --> 41:29.890
Here it tells to the priest, you're going to read

41:30.123 --> 41:39.016
When this is July, this is August, we commemorate the Maccabees, martyrs, Jewish martyrs, 1st of August.

41:39.577 --> 41:46.928
We commemorate, for example, Christmas, let's find Christmas.

41:46.948 --> 41:50.894
October, October, November, St.

41:50.914 --> 41:52.356
Barbara, here.

41:52.376 --> 41:54.179
My daughter is Barbara.

41:54.199 --> 41:57.364
Barbara, here she is.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.105
And...

41:58.372 --> 42:01.456
Let's find Nicholas.

42:02.838 --> 42:03.398
Nicolau.

42:04.039 --> 42:04.640
Here you are.

42:05.241 --> 42:10.988
It tells him here with all these strange writings, their abbreviations actually.

42:11.468 --> 42:16.294
It's Evangelio, a page and the number so that the priest can go there.

42:16.755 --> 42:17.436
It was used.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.378
Eventually it was placed here.

42:19.418 --> 42:22.041
The illuminations as you can see are beautiful.

42:22.222 --> 42:24.244
Wonderful.

42:25.118 --> 42:28.183
This book was prepared for the priest.

42:28.263 --> 42:28.543
Exactly.

42:28.744 --> 42:30.887
So why did it need those illuminations?

42:31.788 --> 42:33.952
Because they were very grateful people.

42:34.933 --> 42:38.238
And they wanted to give to the gospel a special prestige.

42:38.959 --> 42:44.147
So when you open up, they put this gold and things like that, so you know it's a sacred book, first.

42:44.588 --> 42:46.891
Second, God became man.

42:48.093 --> 42:50.116
So the world became flesh.

42:50.517 --> 42:52.560
We want to represent all these things.

42:52.878 --> 42:55.901
We no longer have the problem of the Old Testament.

42:56.201 --> 42:59.004
Do not make an image of graven things for any other gods.

42:59.365 --> 43:01.286
No, we have no threats.

43:01.387 --> 43:06.131
No threats because we know who God is and we can represent Him as a man.

43:07.733 --> 43:12.458
Because He became a man without losing His perfect deity.

43:15.561 --> 43:19.945
And that is why we represent His transfiguration, His baptism by St.

43:20.586 --> 43:21.066
John.

43:21.106 --> 43:22.648
Would this have been done here too?

43:23.084 --> 43:27.791
Some of them, yes, some of them at Constantinople and sent to us.

43:28.573 --> 43:32.258
One has to sit down and see the history of each Codex, and I'm not the expert.

43:32.278 --> 43:33.520
And what does this say on that?

43:34.061 --> 43:40.752
Here, this is a thing which it was placed a couple years ago.

43:40.772 --> 43:41.413
What is it?

43:41.473 --> 43:44.678
It says Evangelion, Gospel.

43:44.718 --> 43:45.900
That's the Gospel.

43:47.863 --> 43:51.268
Crucifixion.

43:51.738 --> 43:57.104
It gives here the main feasts, so it makes it more interesting.

43:57.144 --> 43:59.846
If you have illuminations, just only the words, not only the words.

44:00.487 --> 44:05.392
Besides, the Byzantine art is expressions, is giving you messages.

44:05.832 --> 44:11.779
That is why we do not very much like the Renaissance style, because it gives you the reality.

44:11.799 --> 44:13.741
It gives you the reality, quote-unquote.

44:14.181 --> 44:15.903
It gives you how things are.

44:16.203 --> 44:17.104
We know how things are.

44:17.388 --> 44:21.792
You know, the body and the scenery and the background and things like that.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.975
But the Byzantines are trying to express.

44:25.596 --> 44:32.403
That is why we have the expressionism, which was developed in France, I think, in the 18th century.

44:33.103 --> 44:36.987
For the Byzantine, it was something very old.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.670
And that's so remarkable, too, is this book has been used.

44:39.950 --> 44:40.451
Oh, yes.

44:40.551 --> 44:42.973
You see books of ours that were done in France.

44:43.325 --> 44:44.527
They've never been touched.

44:44.547 --> 44:49.074
Yes, they are beautiful and beautiful because people paid a lot of money to have it done.

44:50.015 --> 44:52.198
It's a trinket.

44:52.759 --> 44:53.520
It's a decoration.

44:53.600 --> 44:58.027
This was made to be used and to be revered.

44:58.267 --> 45:03.095
And that is why you see here some gold is gone.

45:03.115 --> 45:10.125
You see, because the hand of the priest was here in the edge and by touching some of it, it's gone.

45:15.067 --> 45:16.668
Look at that.

45:16.688 --> 45:17.749
Descendants to Hades.

45:17.970 --> 45:25.716
This is the very presentation, the orthodox, the orthodox, the presentation of resurrection.

45:26.677 --> 45:30.300
This is how Christ, because Christ died.

45:30.981 --> 45:31.562
He doesn't die.

45:31.842 --> 45:33.543
His life himself, itself.

45:34.544 --> 45:37.767
But when he was resurrected, nobody has seen him.

45:37.787 --> 45:40.189
Nobody knows how he was resurrected.

45:40.209 --> 45:42.151
What do you see from the Renaissance?

45:42.191 --> 45:43.352
You know, he's coming out,

45:43.518 --> 45:47.363
holding the flag of Vatican, things like that.

45:47.383 --> 45:47.703
It's ridiculous.

45:47.743 --> 45:49.105
Ridiculous.

45:49.125 --> 45:54.232
This is our resurrection, the resurrection of the souls from Hades.

45:54.672 --> 46:03.784
And he resurrects the just from the Old Testament first, as well as people like Plato who are waiting for him and Aristotle.

46:03.804 --> 46:05.306
Dante puts them in purgatory.

46:07.589 --> 46:09.311
They can never go to... No comment.

46:10.813 --> 46:12.715
And here we have the ascension.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.638
Ascension or Assumption?

46:14.899 --> 46:15.299
Assumption.

46:15.319 --> 46:15.940
Assumption.

46:17.201 --> 46:29.195
And Pentecost, which closed the whole divine stewardship and begins the new era, the Church.

46:29.215 --> 46:32.439
And here you have the Twelve Apostles, even Paul.

46:32.779 --> 46:41.489
Although historically he wasn't there, yet he is there because in God's mind he was already an apostle before all ages.

46:41.649 --> 46:42.811
That's Expressionism.

46:42.831 --> 46:43.191
Exactly.

46:43.880 --> 46:57.318
And you get the idea because eventually Paul surpassed all the apostles, you know, in everything, without meaning that they are at least, but you can see the meanings, you know, what's behind all this.

46:58.019 --> 47:07.813
You can see also they're holding Gospels, but they wrote the Gospels three decades, two or three decades later on.

47:07.833 --> 47:10.957
This is Pentecost, how it is represented.

47:11.999 --> 47:13.701
The energies of the Holy Spirit

47:14.204 --> 47:26.941
They're coming to man, and they became, they were cleansed, the first stage, cleansed from their passions, illuminated, and then being perfect as Christ was.

47:26.961 --> 47:27.942
This is vellum, right?

47:28.383 --> 47:29.304
This is parchment.

47:29.344 --> 47:30.185
Parchment, yes, same.

47:30.426 --> 47:33.269
I'm sorry, I didn't know the name.

47:33.450 --> 47:34.772
Well, that's made from animals still.

47:35.112 --> 47:35.893
Exactly.

47:35.913 --> 47:36.494
What was it, what?

47:37.015 --> 47:37.695
Vellum.

47:37.715 --> 47:38.116
Vellum.

47:38.216 --> 47:39.318
Parchment is the same thing.

47:39.338 --> 47:39.998
I never heard it.

47:40.019 --> 47:41.140
That's why I said parchment.

47:43.077 --> 47:45.120
I didn't know that it's the same thing.

47:45.140 --> 47:46.683
Well, it's a villain.

47:47.504 --> 47:48.565
Maybe a... Pergament.

47:48.786 --> 47:50.128
Pergament.

47:50.148 --> 47:50.769
Or Pergament.

47:51.310 --> 47:51.830
Yes, I did.

47:51.850 --> 47:52.331
You were there.

47:53.393 --> 47:53.833
I know that.

47:54.234 --> 47:57.559
I write about that story in the book I'm going to send you.

47:57.579 --> 48:02.667
Now, I can see the writing, and I'm sure that this is coming from professional calligraphers.

48:04.390 --> 48:07.394
Whereas, here, he's not a professional calligrapher.

48:07.875 --> 48:09.237
He's very good in the maps.

48:09.537 --> 48:12.280
But his writing is not very good.

48:12.781 --> 48:14.803
Because the man wasn't a calligrapher.

48:14.823 --> 48:18.227
Yet he wanted to write on these things and he presented.

48:19.008 --> 48:21.571
But here we have a professional... And we're thankful that he did.

48:21.731 --> 48:23.774
Of course, of course.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.436
He wasn't a professional in everything.

48:25.796 --> 48:27.838
He was a very good geographer but not a very good writer.

48:29.100 --> 48:36.468
Here we have an excellent calligrapher and I'm sure this is coming from the palaces of Byzantium.

48:36.488 --> 48:37.890
Calligraphy-like.

48:38.242 --> 48:42.027
This one, which also comes from the emperor.

48:42.087 --> 48:43.549
Where is it?

48:44.851 --> 48:45.432
It's here.

48:45.452 --> 48:46.794
This style of calligraphy.

48:46.814 --> 48:48.696
How old is that?

48:49.077 --> 48:53.082
This is 1301, according to a German expert lady.

48:53.262 --> 48:54.404
We will go back to that.

48:55.385 --> 48:57.668
But I'm making this.

48:57.688 --> 48:59.230
It looks very much the same.

48:59.751 --> 49:07.962
This style, like this style over here, which is a scroll, liturgical scroll, of the kneeling prayers on Pentecost,

49:09.089 --> 49:11.352
And the style is very much the same.

49:11.873 --> 49:16.819
Big letters, beautifully homemade, if you come and see them.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.201
It's the same school.

49:18.281 --> 49:20.344
Maybe not the same person, but the same school.

49:21.005 --> 49:24.430
And when we see this kind of writing, we know this is from the palace.

49:24.450 --> 49:28.255
Did they make the parchment here on Atlas, or did they bring it in, do you think?

49:29.476 --> 49:30.738
It's very difficult to make.

49:31.559 --> 49:34.183
I'm sure they brought it here.

49:34.543 --> 49:35.805
I know that paper

49:36.038 --> 49:42.391
Well, we had paper even before the Italians actually, from the Alps.

49:42.892 --> 49:46.479
But then it was cheaper for us and we had it from Italy.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.646
So I suppose also partially.

49:49.846 --> 49:52.211
Besides, we do not have ghosts here.

49:52.892 --> 49:54.756
You couldn't do it.

49:55.090 --> 50:03.060
You cannot have female... To make one Gutenberg Bible to 250 sheep.

50:04.602 --> 50:06.244
And they call that on vellum, by the way.

50:06.745 --> 50:12.372
There are Gutenberg Bibles on paper and some on vellum, which is part of it.

50:12.392 --> 50:13.714
But they say, say, 250 sheep.

50:13.734 --> 50:18.560
No, I don't know how many of these are slaughtered.

50:18.580 --> 50:24.287
I'm sure as many as the old Israel used to sacrifice to God.

50:24.841 --> 50:51.827
Now, here we have something from a very important emperor, Constantine de Monomachos, who was the second, if I'm not mistaken, or the third, let's say one of the first Byzantine emperors, who said that this is going to be a monastic state, no one can come here because the monks for spiritual reasons want to be away from marriage and things like this, etc., etc., etc.,

50:51.976 --> 50:54.779
It will be protected and it gives rights and things like that.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.703
This is his personal sultra.

50:57.723 --> 50:59.405
The sultra that he was using.

50:59.966 --> 51:02.769
You can see his red signature.

51:03.190 --> 51:07.815
Only he could use red ink, as well as... And it's Constantine?

51:08.496 --> 51:11.400
Constantine the Monomarchus.

51:12.341 --> 51:13.722
He's in the book also.

51:14.764 --> 51:15.805
I think he's the ninth.

51:15.965 --> 51:19.249
Constantine the ninth, if I'm not mistaken.

51:19.634 --> 51:26.224
He lived in the 11th century, gave many rights to the monastery and to all Athos.

51:26.244 --> 51:28.667
That's an 11th century sultan.

51:28.707 --> 51:32.132
Yes, and it was his own personal, and he gave it to the monastery.

51:34.716 --> 51:38.762
And again, you can see the calligraphy in small letters, how beautiful.

51:38.842 --> 51:41.586
And he gave it to the monastery in the 11th century.

51:41.606 --> 51:41.686
Yes.

51:41.706 --> 51:43.488
And it's been here ever since.

51:43.829 --> 51:44.410
It was used.

51:44.470 --> 51:45.772
I'm sure it was used by many.

51:46.192 --> 51:48.516
But it's been here in the monastery.

51:48.536 --> 51:48.696
Exactly.

51:48.980 --> 51:52.044
And you can see how beautiful the ink.

51:52.064 --> 51:52.564
See the ink?

51:54.046 --> 51:55.308
As if it was done yesterday.

51:55.909 --> 51:56.930
Perfect.

51:56.950 --> 52:02.797
And I said, again, I repeat, we have another 20 manuscripts which we discovered.

52:03.258 --> 52:06.502
Nobody knows about them in such a perfect condition.

52:09.025 --> 52:16.014
From the palace again, from Byzantium.

52:16.034 --> 52:18.497
Now, let's continue.

52:18.764 --> 52:22.892
with the codices, and then we go to the documents.

52:23.153 --> 52:25.197
We don't have to do all of these, by the way.

52:25.357 --> 52:28.023
I will, if you're not tired.

52:28.043 --> 52:30.648
Because I feel demoted now, I want to throw everything.

52:30.668 --> 52:31.590
Okay.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.975
So, I will be brief.

52:34.356 --> 52:37.342
This is the oldest manuscript of the monastery.

52:37.803 --> 52:40.047
Ninth century, completed manuscript.

52:40.448 --> 52:43.511
Because we have a few even before the ninth century.

52:43.531 --> 52:44.372
Which are fragments.

52:44.532 --> 52:49.257
Which are fragments like this one here, which is only one page from the sixth century.

52:51.079 --> 52:53.001
This is completed, ninth century.

52:53.021 --> 52:53.701
And what is it?

52:53.721 --> 53:09.257
It is the commentary on the Sons of David by one of the Fathers of the Church called Theodoritos, Bishop of Tyros, or Cyrus maybe in English, of Syria.

53:09.676 --> 53:14.923
Syria was also a province of the Romans and then of the Byzantines.

53:15.645 --> 53:17.667
And that's a fragment from the 6th century.

53:18.128 --> 53:22.695
The fragment is from the Gospel of the 6th century in majuscule writing, as you can see.

53:23.376 --> 53:27.562
Whereas this is one of the very first codices in the miniscule writing.

53:29.685 --> 53:31.427
And did I say 9th century?

53:31.447 --> 53:32.008
You said 9th.

53:32.428 --> 53:33.430
I think it is 8th.

53:35.092 --> 53:36.394
Let me think.

53:36.414 --> 53:38.417
The miniscule writing begins.

53:38.853 --> 53:39.654
In the 9th?

53:39.994 --> 53:41.136
Yes, in the 9th century.

53:41.156 --> 53:41.776
It's 800.

53:42.297 --> 53:43.198
So it's 9th.

53:43.218 --> 53:44.079
It's 9th, yes.

53:46.381 --> 53:50.506
Whereas the other are also fragments from Gospels from the 9th, 10th, 11th.

53:50.906 --> 53:51.727
We had a fire.

53:51.787 --> 54:02.219
According to experts, a fire must have happened, unfortunately, somewhere in the monasteries, and we lost many documents and mosques.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.923
And that is one of the reasons why the possibility that we have here

54:06.342 --> 54:08.565
Because it's far away.

54:09.366 --> 54:11.648
This fortress really helped very much.

54:11.668 --> 54:12.369
Who brought them here?

54:12.389 --> 54:13.010
Who brought them?

54:13.030 --> 54:15.473
The fathers of the monastery in 1867.

54:15.513 --> 54:17.255
They decided to bring everything here.

54:20.318 --> 54:20.939
From all over?

54:21.239 --> 54:24.723
The monastery.

54:24.743 --> 54:26.726
And here we have a palimpsis codex.

54:27.226 --> 54:29.169
And I can see it gives you a lot of... What do you call it?

54:29.189 --> 54:29.990
What kind of codex?

54:30.010 --> 54:30.710
Palimpsis codex.

54:30.730 --> 54:31.732
Oh, that's a palimpsest.

54:32.052 --> 54:34.134
Palimpsest, which... Yes, yes, yes.

54:34.154 --> 54:34.695
...demoni.

54:34.996 --> 54:51.919
It's a magical writing, you can see it here, with the eye here, from the 8th century.

54:53.521 --> 54:56.045
So this must be also 8th century.

54:56.806 --> 54:57.467
No, no, no.

54:58.027 --> 54:58.728
8th century.

54:59.369 --> 54:59.910
Last night.

55:00.411 --> 55:00.871
Last night.

55:01.112 --> 55:03.535
And don't let me say anything else.

55:03.886 --> 55:32.830
in the 8th century in the Manju school speeches of Saint Chrysostom on the Pauline letters and 500 years later on in the 13th century somebody who could find access easily to the Chrysostomian work because he was the most popular and is the most popular Byzantine church father regarding his writings he decided to

55:33.586 --> 55:39.696
And it was not easy to find another parchment to do this.

55:40.437 --> 55:43.943
Everything is in parchment, by the way.

55:43.963 --> 55:46.146
He tried to scratch as much as he could beyond writing.

55:46.467 --> 55:50.253
And we have the new one, which is in the 13th century.

55:50.273 --> 55:51.835
500 years old.

55:52.777 --> 55:54.219
And they did this.

55:54.239 --> 55:56.623
And it is a very rare ascetical work.

55:56.924 --> 55:58.767
Which, the one on top or the one underneath?

55:59.368 --> 56:00.490
The one on the top.

56:00.510 --> 56:00.690
Yes.

56:00.910 --> 56:03.394
The one underneath is Chrysostomos, 8th century.

56:03.494 --> 56:05.417
On the top, 13th century.

56:05.958 --> 56:08.161
Which is more important as text?

56:08.181 --> 56:10.525
As a text, the 13th century.

56:10.805 --> 56:11.066
Really?

56:11.106 --> 56:13.109
Because the 8th century, we have many.

56:13.129 --> 56:14.090
We have many other copies.

56:14.111 --> 56:14.972
Many of Chrysostomos.

56:15.653 --> 56:21.702
When we go to the collection on the top of the library, we shall see many Chrysostomian works.

56:21.722 --> 56:23.505
It was very popular.

56:24.683 --> 56:34.955
And it's an ascetical work by Saint Antiochus, a monk who lived at the famous monastery of Saint Saba in Palestine.

56:34.975 --> 56:37.618
And here, this is paper.

56:37.638 --> 56:47.449
During the Dark Age of the Turkish Dominion, we still have some people who had inherited the Byzantine skills.

56:48.430 --> 56:53.256
It's a monk who became a bishop eventually, named Gregory, of this monastery.

56:53.573 --> 57:08.094
And in this beautiful codex, he wrote in big letters, mini-school writings, but big mini-school writings, so that the priest won't have any problems in reading them.

57:09.216 --> 57:11.019
And this is St.

57:11.039 --> 57:11.820
John Chrysostomos.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.522
And the second part is St.

57:13.983 --> 57:19.691
Basil, the two most important liturgies of the Orthodox Church.

57:20.312 --> 57:21.874
Where is it?

57:21.894 --> 57:22.315
Somewhere.

57:25.670 --> 57:29.075
And you can see the very first letters.

57:29.216 --> 57:30.257
That's paper.

57:30.297 --> 57:35.265
It's remarkably... It's paper, but it's really... It's excellent.

57:35.366 --> 57:36.387
We call it fox.

57:36.407 --> 57:39.713
There's been no foxing, no oxidization of this paper.

57:40.754 --> 57:42.457
It's beautiful.

57:42.477 --> 57:42.978
It's a beauty.

57:43.058 --> 57:44.280
And you say from the Dark Ages?

57:44.320 --> 57:46.083
What years were these again?

57:46.964 --> 57:48.607
Middle of the 17th century.

57:49.889 --> 57:52.453
For us, there's no Middle Ages, Dark Ages.

57:52.771 --> 57:55.434
But you said, you know, the Dark Ages of the Turkish domination.

57:55.534 --> 57:55.755
Exactly.

57:55.835 --> 57:59.199
These are for the Byzantines, the Greeks.

57:59.219 --> 58:00.080
I understand.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.201
This is the Dark Ages.

58:02.282 --> 58:04.605
Now, we left one thing.

58:04.886 --> 58:11.974
This is an edict by Antiochus Pallion Lombo II.

58:14.097 --> 58:17.020
And he is doing what?

58:18.542 --> 58:22.727
He is writing in this document all the things that

58:23.213 --> 58:37.654
His predecessors have given to the monastery and he acknowledges them and gives additional things like properties, money, protection, items of art.

58:39.436 --> 58:41.219
And you can see this big signature.

58:41.539 --> 58:49.831
And he signs, and this is very interesting, history has been twisted very much due to the Florence and the Vatican.

58:49.851 --> 58:52.495
It signs as the faithful king

58:53.065 --> 58:54.527
an emperor of the Romans.

58:57.490 --> 59:05.259
The word Byzantine Empire is something by a scholar in the 16th century.

59:05.279 --> 59:08.343
See, the Byzantines never called themselves Byzantines.

59:08.363 --> 59:10.225
That's a neologism, is what we call it.

59:10.345 --> 59:12.428
We call ourselves Romni, even today.

59:12.868 --> 59:13.309
Romni.

59:13.930 --> 59:21.098
Roman, it was a name for the people who were under the Roman Empire, and then

59:21.365 --> 59:26.530
the new Roman Empire, that is what we call Byzantine today.

59:27.411 --> 59:41.043
And there were Greeks, there were Syrians, Egyptians, Armenians, Italians, Spanish, north of Africa.

59:41.063 --> 59:43.586
Then Islam came and took many of these provinces.

59:43.606 --> 59:48.330
And then the Germanic tribes came and saw the western side of the Roman Empire.

59:48.350 --> 59:51.253
But we still have the Eastern Roman Empire intact.

59:51.672 --> 59:54.916
which is called conventional Byzantine Empire.

59:55.457 --> 59:57.880
You will have to use that in order to make a differentiation.

59:57.900 --> 59:59.362
But they never did.

59:59.382 --> 01:00:05.610
They always called themselves Romans.

01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:07.512
And many, many other things.

01:00:07.572 --> 01:00:10.656
Russia, many, many other things.

01:00:11.177 --> 01:00:15.002
Because there are many information here which nobody knew.

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:21.190
Let's go back to the documentary.

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:30.583
We have seen these two from the liturgical, but it came from the palace of the Byzantine Eucharist.

01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:41.696
This came from the Ecumenical Patriarch, who is at Constantinople till today, and is a saint, Philotheos, who was a monk here.

01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:47.142
Became an abbot in Lavra, and eventually he became the Ecumenical Patriarch.

01:00:47.943 --> 01:00:49.725
He was very important

01:00:50.245 --> 01:01:12.728
during the period of the 14th century, when there was a clash between Western and Eastern theology, which was politics behind it as well, the rational ideas of the West, you know, scholasticism, versus spiritualism, because in the West they lost the purpose.

01:01:12.928 --> 01:01:19.054
God became man, so man should become God through the divine energies.

01:01:19.439 --> 01:01:27.709
They began saying, we can't receive God, He's unapproachable, like the ancient Greeks used to say, because they didn't have the Reformation or the Old Testament.

01:01:27.729 --> 01:01:36.020
And also they were saying things like, paradise is a beautiful place, which we will go there.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.567
Whereas one thing, paradise is not a beautiful place, it's a union with God, it's a deification.

01:01:41.587 --> 01:01:42.708
This is salvation.

01:01:42.728 --> 01:01:44.530
Salvation means to become complete.

01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:48.315
The Greek word is sotiria, which means to be,

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.772
sword, wand.

01:01:52.755 --> 01:01:55.919
I say these words because your daughter is wrong.

01:01:55.959 --> 01:01:58.723
They will help you with this.

01:01:58.743 --> 01:02:17.728
Now, here we have a very important document, just three years after the fall of Constantinople, 1456, by a Spanish king who was a very Philhellen, because many scholars fled from Byzantium when they saw the Turks coming,

01:02:18.097 --> 01:02:31.690
They went to the West, they brought many of the books also with them, as well as their own artists, whether they were musicians, writers, historians, astronomers, etc., etc.

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:47.985
And Renaissance owes a lot of it, regarding science and arts, to these people who went to the courts of kings in Spain, in Italy, in France.

01:02:48.826 --> 01:02:52.630
a revival, many things in the West.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:55.854
He is actually threatening the people here.

01:02:55.894 --> 01:03:00.039
Whoever makes a piracy against the monastery, he will be fined with 10,000 gold.

01:03:00.139 --> 01:03:01.921
Whoever makes a what against the monastery?

01:03:02.342 --> 01:03:13.855
If anyone makes a piracy against the monastery, he will be fined with 10,000 gold and fiorines, which is about millions of dollars today.

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:19.872
And he had the strongest fleet in the western Mediterranean fleet.

01:03:20.793 --> 01:03:38.351
And although the Turks were here, we used this in order to be protected also from the Turks, but as well as from the pirates, because the Turks wouldn't harm the pirates if the pirates harmed the Greeks.

01:03:39.512 --> 01:03:43.977
And the pirates wouldn't dare to quarrel with the Ottoman Empire, which was very strong.

01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:45.877
And both were willing to kill them.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:52.027
But they were, for them it was easy to come over here and do whatever they would like to do.

01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:53.690
Peaceful people.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.675
Yes, and so this was very, very important.

01:03:56.855 --> 01:04:06.370
As well as this one here, a Turkish human by the grandfather of Mohammed, the Conqueror, in which

01:04:07.025 --> 01:04:09.088
What's behind this?

01:04:09.108 --> 01:04:11.311
This is actually a copy.

01:04:11.752 --> 01:04:14.916
We made many copies of this, so all the monarchs would have one of this copy.

01:04:15.497 --> 01:04:19.062
And it talks, it was issued, I think, in the 13th or 14th century.

01:04:19.743 --> 01:04:36.306
And it says in the ancient Turkish writing, which looks like Arabic, that no Muslims, no heathens, no female, no female animals, no pirates, no, no, no, no, can come to this holy place.

01:04:37.383 --> 01:04:49.241
And the grandson of this man, this man was Murat, Murat who was the chief of the Turkish people in the 14th century.

01:04:49.502 --> 01:04:59.257
His grandson, Mohammed, who conquered Constantinople, and as I said, his mother was Orthodox and some say that he was a Crypto-Christian.

01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:05.787
That is why he embraced the Orthodox Church diplomatically

01:05:06.509 --> 01:05:08.913
And the office of the church survived.

01:05:09.213 --> 01:05:14.402
They didn't kill all the priests and destroy all the churches and all the monasteries, you know.

01:05:14.422 --> 01:05:15.083
They didn't write down.

01:05:15.784 --> 01:05:19.010
God knows how to deal the deal.

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:21.233
My machine was off for about five minutes.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:23.217
You see, I'm constantly checking the time.

01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:24.639
All right.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.586
And I always mark so I know where to go.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:32.432
And there was one very important quote that you gave me that you said,

01:05:33.307 --> 01:05:44.145
For a number of years, you didn't allow Westerners in here, because they... Could you kind of think about that again, just those few comments about why Westerners weren't allowed in here?

01:05:44.165 --> 01:05:56.226
First of all, because, as we said, historically speaking, the Westerners, when acid crusaders came here, they destroyed, instead of liberating the Holy Land,

01:05:56.459 --> 01:06:01.564
They destroyed the Byzantine Empire and they conquered the Empire.

01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:18.462
Although they were Christians, supposedly, they were so cruel that when the Turks came two centuries later on, they said, it's better to have the Turks on our heads than what the Pope is wearing.

01:06:18.482 --> 01:06:23.327
They didn't want to have anything with the Westerners because they saw that they were completely betrayed by them.

01:06:25.518 --> 01:06:31.712
Crusaders came in 1204 in Constantinople and they were raiding the nuns.

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:35.882
Burn thousands of manuscripts like this.

01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:42.497
Try to destroy the Roman Empire so that they will be conceived as the Roman Empire.

01:06:46.477 --> 01:06:52.026
We were saying more recently, you wouldn't let people come in to see this book.

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:59.397
Because, as I said, the historical reason, the people became kind of prejudiced with whatever was coming from the West.

01:07:00.419 --> 01:07:01.921
We see a lot of evil coming from there.

01:07:02.482 --> 01:07:11.877
Also, recently, Tischerdorf, who stole manuscripts from Sider, others who came here and cut

01:07:13.325 --> 01:07:20.375
Unfortunately, we have a few manuscripts in which you will see black holes there.

01:07:20.575 --> 01:07:21.637
And how did that happen?

01:07:21.677 --> 01:07:22.718
People left them alone?

01:07:22.778 --> 01:07:24.100
They were trusting of these people?

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.364
They trusted the Westerners, Germans.

01:07:26.724 --> 01:07:29.388
They trusted them with the books.

01:07:29.428 --> 01:07:29.728
Yes.

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:30.990
And they would slice them out.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:31.891
Exactly.

01:07:31.992 --> 01:07:37.519
And they were using, usually, shaving razors.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.342
Razor glands.

01:07:39.362 --> 01:07:40.143
Razor glands, exactly.

01:07:41.705 --> 01:07:42.927
Now, now,

01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:45.965
Of course, things are different.

01:07:47.467 --> 01:07:52.815
They're professionals and they respect it more than anybody else.

01:07:52.895 --> 01:07:55.058
And we trust them.

01:07:55.098 --> 01:07:57.602
You satisfy yourself of their bona fides, too.

01:07:57.662 --> 01:08:00.286
I'm sure they have to demonstrate who they are.

01:08:00.306 --> 01:08:01.347
Of course.

01:08:01.367 --> 01:08:04.812
That is why Father said, well, you're coming from.

01:08:04.912 --> 01:08:05.874
That's right.

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:08.297
And I respect that.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.682
Because we had a lot of these kind of things, you know.

01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:14.144
or they stole it.

01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:18.691
They took five robes, right?

01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:24.319
And when they were leaving, they gave four, or they took one and ran out.

01:08:24.339 --> 01:08:40.082
Or, as I said, the British guy from this geography cut the two pieces, two pages, where they have the maps of England, Britain, Ireland, as well as the globe.

01:08:40.822 --> 01:08:43.225
You think they would return it, don't you?

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:43.825
No, no.

01:08:43.905 --> 01:08:44.586
Have you asked?

01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:59.341
We will, we have, but, you know, the man who runs the British Museum for the Elgin Marble as well, you know, he has said behind the scenes, if I give all these things, I have to hear, we have to shut down the museum.

01:09:00.623 --> 01:09:00.823
No.

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:09.512
Besides, we were not very professionals ourselves in Greece in order to protect the Western.

01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:11.129
The West had technology.

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:16.436
We lost the technology because we were slaves to the Turks.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:28.611
So there is the bright side behind this evil thing of stealing and buying and cheating and things like that because many things were preserved in the West.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:29.152
That's right.

01:09:29.172 --> 01:09:30.994
But now it's time to return them.

01:09:31.014 --> 01:09:32.896
They took care of them.

01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:33.657
They preserved them.

01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:36.040
Those pages belong here.

01:09:36.357 --> 01:09:39.861
As I said, they will never come back, but they are there.

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:41.483
You know, there's always precedent.

01:09:41.563 --> 01:09:47.389
Denmark gave Iceland back their Icelandic sagas, you know, very recently.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:49.952
Extraordinary, almost unprecedented.

01:09:49.972 --> 01:09:51.593
They said, these belong to you.

01:09:51.974 --> 01:09:54.016
And so they have them.

01:09:54.036 --> 01:09:54.837
It's not easy.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:10:02.986
We have, for example, a lot of difficulties with the double oaks to give us one mosaic icon, which is because there are 19 in the whole world.

01:10:03.006 --> 01:10:05.048
We have two here.

01:10:05.365 --> 01:10:07.307
which are in the treasury, are accessible.

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:13.574
The third one is at Dabartot Oaks, and we have to do that.

01:10:14.776 --> 01:10:20.702
But we hope, if we do it in New York, that the people will be willing to... I'd be amazed if they didn't do it.

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:24.947
And we are doing everything according to the letter.

01:10:24.967 --> 01:10:31.795
We have insurance companies, we have brought experts from all the museums to come here to talk exactly.

01:10:32.045 --> 01:10:37.392
what it is, how was the price, how it will be transported, when.

01:10:37.973 --> 01:10:40.035
It's a big, big, big thing.

01:10:40.055 --> 01:10:43.079
We hope that it will begin in 1999.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.441
Next year.

01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:57.878
And it will go to Athens, Cyprus, London, Germany, Brussels.

01:10:58.459 --> 01:10:59.180
That's huge.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.022
And...

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.399
Maybe New York or something?

01:11:02.419 --> 01:11:03.220
Maybe New York as well.

01:11:03.901 --> 01:11:10.047
I'm pushing them to go to America because I was there and I'm saying to people here, go to America.

01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:11.429
Go to America.

01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:12.550
There are many people there.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:13.671
They will appreciate it.

01:11:13.932 --> 01:11:14.372
I know it.

01:11:14.492 --> 01:11:15.694
I was there.

01:11:15.954 --> 01:11:20.759
Well, the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum was remarkable.

01:11:20.879 --> 01:11:21.360
I was there.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.062
And we can do better.

01:11:24.844 --> 01:11:30.390
We have thousands and thousands of things and we do not appreciate it and present it.

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:31.431
And we are not going there.

01:11:31.883 --> 01:11:37.274
We're not going just to place items like it was done in Salonika.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:41.443
We want items, good lighting, a few labels maybe.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:41.984
No, no, no.

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:45.992
We're going to make an atmosphere of an afterlife in the monastery.

01:11:46.012 --> 01:11:48.157
You will enter it as if you are in the monastery.

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.702
You will enter as if you are in the church.

01:11:52.117 --> 01:12:06.774
And there you will find models and inscriptions and many, many information so that people can sit there and learn all the history about the rank, whatever, if it is a holy chalice or if it's a manuscript.

01:12:06.794 --> 01:12:08.256
And they will know what is in there.

01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:14.783
They don't have to have the tape recording telling them, oh, somebody like me who is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:12:14.803 --> 01:12:16.285
But this will all be from Vardopevi.

01:12:16.425 --> 01:12:17.266
From Vardopevi.

01:12:17.286 --> 01:12:18.948
And what will the name of the exhibition be?

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:19.489
Do you know yet?

01:12:19.829 --> 01:12:20.790
What you will call it?

01:12:21.344 --> 01:12:24.288
You still haven't decided in front of it.

01:12:24.308 --> 01:12:27.573
Maybe they have decided, but I never thought of asking about that.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.097
We cannot follow the same as the name of this exhibition.

01:12:31.158 --> 01:12:51.148
It's going to be an international exhibition of heirlooms, of water pevy, which were given or stolen, we want to say, of course, stolen, which are found, we shall say, more diplomatically, in museums and libraries from Moscow to

01:12:51.348 --> 01:12:55.112
Where is that?

01:12:55.293 --> 01:13:02.762
Washington DC to Moscow, London, Paris, Athens.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:06.806
We have museums also in Athens, unfortunately.

01:13:06.826 --> 01:13:10.331
How can we have museums in Athens?

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:19.161
Well, after the liberation, when half of Greece was freed, they brought to us

01:13:20.677 --> 01:13:22.420
politics again.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.121
I have to tell them.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.386
They brought to us German kings.

01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:31.353
They had secularization, Protestant ideas.

01:13:31.914 --> 01:13:48.439
They destroyed 450 monasteries in a few days, forced the monks and nuns to get married, and took all the treasures and took them to, you will see them in Berlin and in Paris and Britain and everywhere else,

01:13:48.672 --> 01:13:52.116
That's another reason why we are very reluctant with the Westerners.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:57.361
I think I have given you many reasons.

01:13:57.421 --> 01:14:03.447
Yes, yes.

01:14:03.467 --> 01:14:08.833
And they eventually kept a few relics in Athens and they said, we will make a Byzantine museum also for the Greeks.

01:14:09.374 --> 01:14:13.718
As well, we are going to make a Byzantine museum in Germany, in France and everywhere.

01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:25.920
And they went to destroy monasticies because monasticies in Orthodoxy is the heart bone, and the eyes, and the head.

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:30.845
Always people trusted above all the fathers from the monasteries.

01:14:30.865 --> 01:14:39.954
And the bishops of the Orthodox Church were traditionally monks.

01:14:40.254 --> 01:14:42.777
Unfortunately, many are coming from

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:56.899
I'm not writing about that, though.

01:14:56.919 --> 01:15:00.363
But I know that you're suffering with, you have problems with the new archbishop.

01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:01.184
Yes.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.227
Very, very serious troubles, actually.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:10.092
But we didn't see the whole idea before we were, let me brief.

01:15:10.112 --> 01:15:11.734
This is another big chapter.

01:15:11.933 --> 01:15:19.024
In a few words, we have Byzantine Vatopadian musicians from the 11th century.

01:15:19.044 --> 01:15:21.568
This is 14th century, this is 19th century.

01:15:21.588 --> 01:15:30.762
Old Byzantine writing notation, musical notation, new one, which was more plain in the 19th century, because this is very complex.

01:15:30.782 --> 01:15:38.734
And we have music by Vatopadians, which was haunted somewhere, and now we discover

01:15:39.018 --> 01:15:51.778
the manuscripts, the author is from 1050, and we are tripping in the church and also making CDs and cassettes as well as videos lately for people to understand.

01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:53.922
And these have recently been found?

01:15:54.022 --> 01:15:54.262
Yes.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:55.404
Again, where?

01:15:55.544 --> 01:15:56.666
In the cells of monks?

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:58.329
Where have you found them?

01:15:58.389 --> 01:15:59.070
The manuscripts?

01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.170
Yes.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:04.527
No, they were here... But people were studying them, because there's so much material.

01:16:04.567 --> 01:16:05.808
How much can you study?

01:16:06.008 --> 01:16:11.094
They studied them, as I said, after 1912, because the Turkish were here until 1912.

01:16:12.976 --> 01:16:21.826
When the Nazis came here, they were destroying Greece everywhere, but after, they respected others.

01:16:21.847 --> 01:16:22.507
Why?

01:16:22.547 --> 01:16:23.188
I'll tell you a story.

01:16:23.368 --> 01:16:26.692
It's really interesting.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:27.553
The Germans

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:34.466
had as allies not only the Italians, but also the Bulgarians, even the Russians in the beginning, as you know.

01:16:35.227 --> 01:16:40.131
Now the Bulgarians, they were very loyal to the Germans, so the Germans allowed them to do whatever they liked.

01:16:40.932 --> 01:16:54.705
So many rebels, Bulgarians, who always wanted to conquer Greece and make it part of big Bulgaria, some of them came to Iarisos, a little village from the eastern side,

01:16:55.023 --> 01:16:59.188
the gate of the eastern side of Athos.

01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:05.055
They were about to come in and make Athos Bulgarian.

01:17:05.275 --> 01:17:08.719
After 950 years.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:16.048
Yes, and have in mind that the Bulgarians, the forefathers of Bulgarian were Turks, who were criminals.

01:17:16.348 --> 01:17:18.711
I mean, they were savages.

01:17:19.032 --> 01:17:22.836
There were Turks criminals, which the Turks couldn't stand.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.801
Which the Turks couldn't stand.

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:29.405
And they sent them from when they were in the middle, in the heart of Asia.

01:17:30.266 --> 01:17:33.308
Because the Turks are, you know, Mongols over there.

01:17:33.328 --> 01:17:34.429
They're very diverse.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.392
And they went to Bolga, Russia.

01:17:38.433 --> 01:17:43.096
And we gave them land, Christianity, writing, St.

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:50.303
Cyril and Methodius, Cyrillian writing, familial, Byzantine missionaries.

01:17:51.604 --> 01:17:53.245
And eventually,

01:17:53.663 --> 01:17:56.465
They wanted to plug out our eyes.

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:58.968
And they never stopped.

01:17:58.988 --> 01:18:01.390
Although they always defeated, thank God.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.991
And they never stopped.

01:18:03.031 --> 01:18:08.015
So when the Germans occupied Greece, they came behind them.

01:18:09.717 --> 01:18:11.559
The Germans didn't care because they were allies.

01:18:11.959 --> 01:18:12.680
Do whatever you like.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.082
So we went to the commander here.

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:18.525
He said, something like that.

01:18:19.045 --> 01:18:20.426
I don't know how you put it on English.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:20.987
No, that's it.

01:18:21.007 --> 01:18:21.767
I understand that.

01:18:21.787 --> 01:18:22.388
I don't care.

01:18:22.537 --> 01:18:25.019
I don't care what that means.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.224
They went to the general commander of Greece.

01:18:30.564 --> 01:18:31.705
He said, I can't do anything.

01:18:31.746 --> 01:18:33.167
They are allies and things like that.

01:18:33.767 --> 01:18:34.568
So the father said, OK.

01:18:34.989 --> 01:18:39.833
They prayed, they prayed, and they prayed, and they said, all right.

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:50.603
One of them said, we shall send a letter to Hitler himself, to Berlin,

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:55.043
and asked him to become the patron of Mount Athos.

01:18:57.225 --> 01:18:58.346
So they sent the letter.

01:18:58.807 --> 01:19:06.634
There was a monk here who had studied in Switzerland, Father Erasmus, and he had a doctorate from there.

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:12.079
And he knew fluent German because he was in the German parts of Switzerland.

01:19:12.099 --> 01:19:15.161
And they sent it immediately to Führer.

01:19:15.181 --> 01:19:19.425
He was very much flattered because he said, you see, holy man,

01:19:19.979 --> 01:19:23.903
people of arts, people of civilization, the Athonite minds.

01:19:24.604 --> 01:19:28.588
They understand what I'm trying to do, the new order that I want to do.

01:19:28.728 --> 01:19:30.610
They want me to be their patron.

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:35.115
And while you're living, they said, we are in danger of the Bulgarians.

01:19:35.135 --> 01:19:35.976
Could you do anything?

01:19:36.997 --> 01:19:41.321
The next morning there wasn't even a Bulgarian nose.

01:19:42.582 --> 01:19:45.025
So others were preserved.

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:46.779
No.

01:19:47.259 --> 01:19:49.582
Miracles work in strange ways, don't they?

01:19:49.603 --> 01:19:51.145
Oh, yes.

01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:54.049
This is from the Tsar, 17th century.

01:19:54.109 --> 01:20:00.017
He's giving us money, rights, such as in Russia, etc., etc.

01:20:00.037 --> 01:20:02.581
You can see here, they're using the two-ingles.

01:20:03.622 --> 01:20:04.383
Oh, yes.

01:20:04.403 --> 01:20:12.615
This is Roman Byzantine emblem, which the Tsars, as well as the princes of Moldavia,

01:20:12.899 --> 01:20:23.229
you are using, because they are the continuation of the Christian Roman Empire, which is called Byzantine Empire.

01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:25.031
And where would this come was the idea?

01:20:26.652 --> 01:20:27.153
Beautiful.

01:20:27.513 --> 01:20:28.254
The seal.

01:20:28.935 --> 01:20:34.560
Of course, the seal of the Byzantine Emperor.

01:20:36.562 --> 01:20:40.166
You have Christ, and that is his seal.

01:20:40.526 --> 01:20:42.568
Yes, the golden seal.

01:20:42.768 --> 01:20:46.515
is him and his monogram.

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:49.461
And what does that particular seal date from?

01:20:49.481 --> 01:20:50.342
1301.

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:51.725
This is from 1301?

01:20:52.045 --> 01:20:52.566
Exactly.

01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:55.392
And this came with that seal?

01:20:55.512 --> 01:20:55.993
Of course.

01:20:56.213 --> 01:20:59.720
That makes it official.

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:05.290
Whereas it looks like cheese.

01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:06.312
You can see that

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:20.616
These people, the Russians and the Romanians, they wanted to be the continuation of the Byzantines, but as Father Artenius said, they couldn't attain that profession of the Byzantines.

01:21:20.636 --> 01:21:22.879
And this is from the emperors.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:31.489
You can see the difference in the arts, in the style, you know, big things, but more fine things.

01:21:32.414 --> 01:21:34.016
And what else do we have?

01:21:34.036 --> 01:21:37.681
And we have also, at the last display, one of the priest books.

01:21:38.202 --> 01:21:41.927
It's a gospel from Venice.

01:21:41.947 --> 01:21:47.935
It's 1,699, something like that.

01:21:47.955 --> 01:21:48.876
600s, 1600s.

01:21:48.936 --> 01:21:59.050
And it's a liturgical gospel for the use of the priest in the church in Venice.

01:21:59.851 --> 01:22:00.852
We can...

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.281
see a little bit of it.

01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:08.509
We have John.

01:22:08.869 --> 01:22:14.779
The very first is Pascha, because Pascha is the most important thing in the Western Church.

01:22:14.799 --> 01:22:16.341
Because this is important.

01:22:16.361 --> 01:22:17.984
Whereas in the Western Church there's no Pascha.

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:21.830
The very Christ, but you want to see him in the resurrection.

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:23.352
Do you see him?

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:23.592
No.

01:22:23.612 --> 01:22:25.035
Do you see him in Christmas?

01:22:25.055 --> 01:22:26.016
But Christmas is the beginning.

01:22:26.757 --> 01:22:27.919
Resurrection is

01:22:29.131 --> 01:22:32.236
the whole meat of the whole people.

01:22:32.256 --> 01:22:33.337
That's right, the essence.

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:34.359
This is the essence.

01:22:34.379 --> 01:22:39.066
To conquer death, to become immortal, to become sons of God.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.632
Somebody has handwritten something out there.

01:22:42.652 --> 01:22:44.214
Yes, somebody was using it.

01:22:45.115 --> 01:22:49.162
And it's giving dates.

01:22:51.545 --> 01:22:52.407
It's not easy to write.

01:22:52.487 --> 01:22:53.689
He says, ah, Theologos.

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:57.214
Ah, he says, Oaios, Ioannis or Theologos.

01:22:58.004 --> 01:22:59.747
This is why Ioannis is a Theologos.

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:08.881
And then he says, Cata Ioannis, the Evangelion Cata Ioannis, the Gospel according to John.

01:23:09.803 --> 01:23:15.692
Probably he wrote that so that he could read these just before beginning the Gospel.

01:23:15.712 --> 01:23:16.593
I see, yes.

01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:19.017
I don't know whether this is everywhere.

01:23:20.397 --> 01:23:22.159
It's a beautiful one.

01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:27.947
As I said, we couldn't have any press, and that is where you see Venice, Paris, Leipzig.

01:23:28.948 --> 01:23:37.540
The classics which we have are coming from Oxford, from Hamburg, from Berlin, Vienna.

01:23:40.965 --> 01:23:43.468
OK, we've finished here.

01:23:43.488 --> 01:23:44.329
Let's go upstairs.

01:23:50.924 --> 01:23:52.286
No.

01:23:52.726 --> 01:23:55.210
You're very kind, I have to tell you, Father.

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.994
I'm very inspired from the movies.

01:23:58.014 --> 01:24:00.177
Now, we are going to speak about the printed books.

01:24:00.397 --> 01:24:01.699
Here we have 1,000 books.

01:24:01.879 --> 01:24:04.042
I know, because I counted one.

01:24:04.903 --> 01:24:07.547
Some years ago, I sat down and I placed them.

01:24:07.987 --> 01:24:15.237
They will be, most of them, taken to the new library because they are 20th century.

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:16.599
Many of them are 20th century.

01:24:16.859 --> 01:24:19.463
Whatever is 19th and back, it's going to stay here.

01:24:20.202 --> 01:24:25.410
And now we're going to see books, books and books, endless books.

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:26.672
You will get the smell.

01:24:27.112 --> 01:24:27.693
Which I love.

01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.997
You know that you love.

01:24:30.017 --> 01:24:31.719
Here you can see security things here.

01:24:34.704 --> 01:24:41.674
Also, here it says, you don't see that in monasteries in the West.

01:24:42.335 --> 01:24:45.300
When you go to the library, it's a cold library.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.243
Everything is perfect, beautiful.

01:24:47.263 --> 01:24:48.825
But you don't see things like

01:24:49.902 --> 01:24:51.605
A bell.

01:24:53.327 --> 01:24:59.857
And a chapel.

01:25:00.118 --> 01:25:02.982
Because the monk here was praying also.

01:25:03.503 --> 01:25:15.641
Because it's dedicated to the birth of the Virgin, 8th of... The birth of the Virgin, 8th of September.

01:25:15.661 --> 01:25:17.664
That's a movement.

01:25:17.684 --> 01:25:18.846
That's registering movement.

01:25:19.096 --> 01:25:26.186
It doesn't necessarily go up, but it's always registered as a sensor device.

01:25:26.927 --> 01:25:30.812
I'm not very good in machines, so I don't want to make any money.

01:25:30.832 --> 01:25:32.655
So, you can see all kinds of things.

01:25:32.755 --> 01:25:47.416
Whatever was published in the West, in Greek, and also in Latin, if it was religious, but also whatever in Greek, regarding all kinds of scientists, all kinds of Asian scientists, they were buying them.

01:25:47.436 --> 01:25:48.397
Now, who was buying them?

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:49.018
The monastery.

01:25:49.285 --> 01:25:49.746
Why?

01:25:49.906 --> 01:25:50.847
So that was policy.

01:25:51.327 --> 01:25:51.528
Yes.

01:25:51.928 --> 01:25:53.010
Policy to buy everything.

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:55.593
To buy everything, even if it wasn't for you.

01:25:55.613 --> 01:25:55.693
Why?

01:25:56.954 --> 01:26:00.098
Because we wanted to preserve our heritage.

01:26:01.059 --> 01:26:09.910
And because in the end of the 18th century, on that hill up there, you will see the ruins of the first college.

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:12.233
He made a college.

01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:13.855
I saw it on the way down.

01:26:13.955 --> 01:26:18.560
And through that college, people like Cosmothetolos, does that ring a bell?

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.541
Yes, yes it does.

01:26:19.561 --> 01:26:26.789
Nicodemus and others, they made, they call it the Greek Enlightenment.

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:34.337
We don't like this word because it's a different place.

01:26:34.357 --> 01:26:35.999
Enlightenment, the word was different.

01:26:36.019 --> 01:26:38.522
Here it was actually surviving.

01:26:39.062 --> 01:26:39.863
To survive,

01:26:40.147 --> 01:26:45.354
the Classics and the Byzantines, our identity.

01:26:45.374 --> 01:26:48.057
So, I'm sorry, these were being brought how far back?

01:26:48.658 --> 01:26:54.325
From the very beginning of Gutenberg, from the very beginning, yes.

01:26:54.345 --> 01:26:57.970
So the attitude has always been to acquire knowledge.

01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:07.382
Yes, because eventually we had this college, today it's a high school, and it is one with the St.

01:27:07.642 --> 01:27:08.483
Andrew Street,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.863
which we spoke together at Caries.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.607
And it's still a high school with 100 kids.

01:27:14.947 --> 01:27:16.208
What was the name of the college?

01:27:16.469 --> 01:27:22.175
I think you have written back to me again.

01:27:22.636 --> 01:27:24.558
You will see a special chapter on that.

01:27:25.218 --> 01:27:25.679
In the book.

01:27:25.779 --> 01:27:26.179
In the book.

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.903
All these people then became educated.

01:27:29.603 --> 01:27:38.233
All these people, either with their pen or with missionary,

01:27:38.568 --> 01:27:40.590
or with a gun.

01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:47.756
Great revolution in 1821, just a few years after this academy.

01:27:47.776 --> 01:27:48.677
This is remarkable.

01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:50.559
This is great.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.382
Better than I expected.

01:27:53.962 --> 01:28:05.773
By preserving the knowledge and faith, especially the faith, we get our identity and we manage to know who we are

01:28:06.142 --> 01:28:11.510
and that we shouldn't be any longer the slaves of these barbaric people.

01:28:12.331 --> 01:28:28.113
We have such noble ancestors, which we have to continue, although we're not at their peak, their style, their class, but we have to... So when books were first being published, they could afford to buy them, too.

01:28:28.133 --> 01:28:28.554
Immediately.

01:28:28.774 --> 01:28:29.856
But they had the money to do it.

01:28:29.956 --> 01:28:30.897
Oh, yes.

01:28:30.917 --> 01:28:32.740
Because, as I said, the czars of Russia...

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:36.525
the Moldavia, Transylvania, Prince, they were giving us money.

01:28:37.267 --> 01:28:54.638
Also, many times, Greeks who were living in the West because they couldn't bear the dominion here, and they had money, they were publishing books, and they were sending the books in libraries, and especially in Monathos, where we had freedom here.

01:28:54.658 --> 01:28:55.420
There was a freedom.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.343
Of course, freedom

01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.058
Relative.

01:28:59.118 --> 01:29:00.199
If you don't do anything harm.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:06.228
They didn't harm us because, as I said, the addict down there, the Mohammed and things like that.

01:29:06.248 --> 01:29:26.537
Now, during the revolution, we helped the revolution, and then they came and they killed the monks and they stole, and thousands had to leave, and for ten years they were roaming here and there, taking the lead from the top of the churches.

01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:32.098
in order to make them bullets and guns and many, many, many things.

01:29:32.118 --> 01:29:35.564
But thank God they were kicked out and the monks came back.

01:29:36.665 --> 01:29:47.122
But we lost many heirlooms, many... They were stealing a beautiful chalice because it had gold.

01:29:47.462 --> 01:29:49.485
They were destroying the chalice just to get the gold.

01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:53.672
But the chalice had also marble, had also silver,

01:29:53.838 --> 01:29:56.881
had also art on it, but they were just maledict in order to me.

01:29:59.464 --> 01:30:00.725
That's what we call a Philistine.

01:30:02.667 --> 01:30:03.007
I know.

01:30:03.287 --> 01:30:05.730
This is from the Old Testament.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:10.194
Now, this is the cross of the Great with St.

01:30:10.214 --> 01:30:23.187
Helen and the cross, the real Holy Cross that discovered in Jerusalem, and then all the emperors that followed from 3.30 until 14.53.

01:30:23.386 --> 01:30:24.768
Some of them are Latins.

01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:33.638
We don't like them at all, because they were from France and they were actually pseudo-eparos, they were actually cointos.

01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:37.503
And what does this chart date from?

01:30:37.623 --> 01:30:43.170
Approximately.

01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:44.351
It doesn't matter, but it's very old.

01:30:44.852 --> 01:30:47.135
It is very old, definitely.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.096
That's right.

01:30:48.116 --> 01:30:50.619
And the language is not the modern, modern Greek.

01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:53.022
It's Greek of 100 years old.

01:30:53.558 --> 01:30:56.443
It doesn't matter, I would just, if you know, it would be interesting.

01:30:56.463 --> 01:30:56.984
I really don't know.

01:30:57.605 --> 01:31:01.332
And also gives you here the Hellenistic background as well, you know.

01:31:01.352 --> 01:31:14.115
Alexander the Great, Theos of Christ, which were used by Athos, Achilleus, you know, Homer.

01:31:16.998 --> 01:31:25.873
We have also books which are in German, in French, in English, because there were fathers who were educated here.

01:31:26.373 --> 01:31:30.440
And the fathers here were the ones who were the teachers or the children.

01:31:31.061 --> 01:31:43.782
And in some manuscripts we have discovered, you know, they play with caricatures or they try to learn the alphabet using the back of the manuscript of the 19th century, you know, things like that.

01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:49.417
So there's no way any living person could ever go through even a fraction of this whole library.

01:31:50.758 --> 01:31:55.603
No, this is the goody.

01:31:55.623 --> 01:31:57.465
This is the what?

01:31:57.505 --> 01:32:00.509
The goody.

01:32:00.609 --> 01:32:02.691
It's a word which I learned in the USA.

01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:03.632
The goody.

01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:07.256
Oh, the goody.

01:32:08.017 --> 01:32:08.678
Top floor.

01:32:08.718 --> 01:32:10.259
This is the third floor?

01:32:10.299 --> 01:32:10.820
Third floor.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.722
And here are round.

01:32:13.057 --> 01:32:29.879
of this perimetrical library, we have printed books, all printed books, and in the middle we have the library.

01:32:29.899 --> 01:32:42.996
Now they have been cleared by graduate students from Salonika, from the University of Salonika, and they will be placed in these for protection purposes, because they are here like we for safety.

01:32:43.988 --> 01:33:12.797
And around here we have books, labels which are attractive literature, Gregor theologian, Basil the Great, Chrysostomos is somewhere all the way to John Tabarthi, Chrysostomos, you see how many Chrysostomos, he was very, look Chrysostomos, look Chrysostomos, the big volumes, very popular, that is why the palentists.

01:33:13.267 --> 01:33:17.245
Here we have also classes.

01:33:17.265 --> 01:33:20.198
We have classes, but it's still Byzantine.

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.990
Byzantine, Byzantine.
