00:02.765 --> 00:20.740
I don't know, but what you're working on, this could be... But you kind of see it as religion of the...

00:20.990 --> 00:22.212
I have no idea what it is.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.553
It's all in fact or German.

00:23.573 --> 00:26.196
But I thought you, you know, let's have you work on that.

00:26.217 --> 00:26.917
Oh, well, fine.

00:26.937 --> 00:29.801
Do any of your German reading friends and let's try it down.

00:29.841 --> 00:31.583
Look at the interesting engraving, though, too.

00:31.643 --> 00:34.507
Well, one is holding philosophy, the other is holding a Bible.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.472
Wisdom or sapientia is radiating from a cloud.

00:39.753 --> 00:47.503
And I don't know whether this is making fun of people who write...

00:48.125 --> 00:56.115
Religious or anti-religious stuff or what it is, but anyway, there you are.

00:56.516 --> 01:00.481
Given what you're writing, I thought that might be of some interest.

01:00.922 --> 01:01.262
Thank you.

01:01.623 --> 01:02.784
I will.

01:03.365 --> 01:07.991
That's like many of those things you... I've got to get that magic number here.

01:11.656 --> 01:17.203
I'll find you pack them in because you know they're going to be interesting sometimes, and

01:17.555 --> 01:20.440
And you wonder when the sometimes... Yeah, that's great.

01:21.762 --> 01:23.184
How long is the book?

01:23.204 --> 01:25.949
I mean, is it... It's about 150, 200 pages.

01:26.009 --> 01:27.792
I mean, it's a real book.

01:28.112 --> 01:30.176
It's not a spoon for anything.

01:30.196 --> 01:30.657
I don't know.

01:30.677 --> 01:31.037
It might.

01:31.057 --> 01:31.578
It could be.

01:31.979 --> 01:32.520
It's a spoon.

01:32.660 --> 01:39.271
It's a... It's a considerable spoon.

01:39.952 --> 01:42.516
Well, it could be one of those philosophical...

01:43.728 --> 01:45.592
Which is kind of fun, too.

01:45.692 --> 01:54.308
You know, a philosophical disquisition of how stupid all these controversialists are and ridiculing religion.

01:54.328 --> 01:55.330
Thank you for coming too.

01:55.731 --> 01:56.652
It's me.

02:00.159 --> 02:03.185
See if I ever come when they're having a box-building convention again.

02:04.668 --> 02:05.449
I took that.

02:05.969 --> 02:08.191
I took a limo in.

02:08.251 --> 02:09.092
A limo.

02:09.192 --> 02:10.934
I'm a man.

02:10.994 --> 02:11.915
I'm a man.

02:12.415 --> 02:14.177
In other words, you didn't have a private cab.

02:14.257 --> 02:17.080
I didn't have a private cab.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.061
We had a long chat.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.025
As he told me, I absolutely had to meet you.

02:22.566 --> 02:27.471
Well, what are you writing about in this new book?

02:27.531 --> 02:30.113
It's about... Dave Kirshenbaum.

02:31.374 --> 02:35.959
Well, back when I was about 14, I started going for anything 18th century I could find loose.

02:36.884 --> 02:38.105
If it's cheap, I'll buy it.

02:40.248 --> 02:46.535
I used to buy things from time to time when I was in graduate school from Carnegie Bookshop, second floor, right across from Bloomingdale.

02:48.157 --> 02:55.685
And I would pop in there occasionally when I didn't have too much loose money to spend, but it was always an interesting place to go.

02:56.506 --> 02:57.988
Well, one day I was in New York.

02:58.068 --> 02:59.690
Are you getting anything here?

02:59.710 --> 03:00.651
No, I can't.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.073
If it's real good, I'll hold it up.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.314
No, it's fine.

03:03.354 --> 03:05.997
That is lovely to use it.

03:06.128 --> 03:07.289
One day I was in New York.

03:07.389 --> 03:09.311
I suppose this was about five or six years ago.

03:10.653 --> 03:18.621
And late one night, I looked at the yellow pages to book dealers to see if there was anything I was missing.

03:18.641 --> 03:23.145
Well, here was Carnegie Bookshop.

03:23.506 --> 03:24.867
And I thought, this is extraordinary.

03:24.887 --> 03:26.529
I thought that place closed years to come.

03:27.270 --> 03:33.716
But here it was on, I think, something like 61st Street, 9 East 61st Street.

03:33.736 --> 03:35.578
So just off this, that was worse.

03:36.065 --> 03:37.066
five, six years ago.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.027
Oh, so it's 57.

03:38.267 --> 03:39.068
No, it's 65.

03:39.088 --> 03:42.491
That's why five, six years ago is when I went to interview him in this very same shop.

03:42.852 --> 03:44.193
Upstairs, little table.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in that room there.

03:46.656 --> 03:49.799
So I went in there, and it is the same guy.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.200
He was 95 or 96 or 97.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.142
He was at the age of 99.

03:53.162 --> 03:53.643
He just died.

03:53.683 --> 04:00.870
No, he had been in the book business since 1916 or some... It's better than that.

04:02.311 --> 04:05.835
He's attended every major auction in New York.

04:06.220 --> 04:10.747
From the Hole to the Manny, from 1912 to 1992.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.431
He was a runner.

04:13.451 --> 04:14.512
He claims to have been a runner.

04:16.415 --> 04:16.775
At age.

04:16.876 --> 04:17.497
Well, whatever.

04:17.537 --> 04:18.618
Age 12 or whatever.

04:18.638 --> 04:19.880
Even if it's apocryphal.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.942
I put it in the book.

04:20.962 --> 04:21.583
It was too good.

04:21.723 --> 04:22.043
Yeah, yeah.

04:22.103 --> 04:24.407
We don't want to check on this story.

04:24.427 --> 04:25.288
It might not be right.

04:25.328 --> 04:27.431
So many stories are too good.

04:27.551 --> 04:30.135
Well, so I went in there.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.007
And I bought all kinds of wonderful things.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.509
He was practically giving them away.

04:35.549 --> 04:37.652
I think he probably had a customer there at a month.

04:39.074 --> 04:39.815
I stumbled in.

04:40.877 --> 04:42.579
Here's a letter signed J. Mill.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.784
I'm not sure whether it was Jon Stewart or James.

04:46.585 --> 04:48.307
For five bucks, I wasn't on equivalent.

04:48.828 --> 04:49.349
And you bought it?

04:49.669 --> 04:50.110
No.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.733
Something else from an English admiral.

04:51.793 --> 04:52.393
Same price.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.498
A wonderful ink.

04:56.710 --> 05:00.254
and wash drawing of Paganini dancing on a violin.

05:00.314 --> 05:01.455
That's a period piece.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.458
That was maybe $10, $5 or $10.

05:04.758 --> 05:08.382
And an album I still haven't figured out.

05:08.462 --> 05:17.852
The paper is watermarked 1812, but it copies out all kinds of 18th century English doggoal verse and notes on who wore what at court.

05:17.872 --> 05:19.733
It's obviously connected with the nobility.

05:19.774 --> 05:26.160
I still haven't deciphered it, but it was a wondrous day of picking up things I least expected

05:26.917 --> 05:30.380
and he was clearly just interested in parking them someplace where somebody wanted them.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.001
And that's Dave.

05:31.561 --> 05:32.923
That is Dave.

05:32.943 --> 05:37.067
I don't know if you've read the Texas chapter of my book yet.

05:37.647 --> 05:39.789
It's one of those things I read around him.

05:39.829 --> 05:43.953
You say, what's he doing in Texas?

05:43.993 --> 05:45.835
Because I was really writing about Luke Feldman.

05:46.536 --> 05:51.020
But he knew Feldman, and Feldman wanted Dave to join ranks with him to sell to Texas.

05:51.541 --> 05:52.862
So I really write at length.

05:52.882 --> 05:55.084
I go off in one of these long, discursive,

05:55.688 --> 05:56.891
things in Dave Kirshen.

05:56.911 --> 05:59.818
It's really, if you'll enjoy this.

05:59.938 --> 06:00.379
All right.

06:00.499 --> 06:01.963
He talked about building collections.

06:02.023 --> 06:07.596
Bradley Martin was his, you know, Bradley Martin's principal supplier.

06:07.616 --> 06:09.580
Anyway, go ahead.

06:09.600 --> 06:09.841
I'm sorry.

06:09.901 --> 06:12.988
Well, so anyway, this has been the

06:13.610 --> 06:16.473
The Cohen sisters at Argosy told me he had died.

06:16.513 --> 06:21.219
One time I came and I said, your old friend there had died.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.962
As I said, how long has this man been in the book business?

06:24.042 --> 06:25.543
And they told me a little bit about him.

06:25.563 --> 06:26.364
Yeah.

06:26.484 --> 06:29.788
In fact, I've got his old bit in the book, in the footnotes.

06:29.808 --> 06:30.509
I'll look that up.

06:31.830 --> 06:32.992
I have my dark connection.

06:34.013 --> 06:39.940
He's in the footnotes, and there's a long, I must say, at least 1,500, 2,000 words on him in a Texas chapter.

06:40.220 --> 06:40.360
Mm-hmm.

06:40.947 --> 06:42.729
Well, we don't just talk about Feldman.

06:42.749 --> 06:44.431
We talk about what he did for NYU.

06:44.551 --> 06:46.674
We talk about the Barrow collection.

06:46.694 --> 06:48.396
He's got these collections.

06:48.536 --> 06:54.984
He talks about the course he fails, whose wife told her it's either you or the books.

06:56.346 --> 06:58.448
Let's go with the books.

06:58.529 --> 07:01.292
You know, he's a certain age.

07:06.158 --> 07:09.222
You know, I think that there are a lot of areas where you can help me.

07:09.702 --> 07:10.363
And you

07:11.018 --> 07:13.981
I love the fact that you're a president of a university here.

07:14.021 --> 07:18.105
Well, there are several things, I think.

07:18.125 --> 07:24.211
One of them that I would face straight out that I did mentally when somebody posed the question to me.

07:24.231 --> 07:28.595
I am fascinated by early material just for itself.

07:28.956 --> 07:32.739
It doesn't have to mean or be anything.

07:32.899 --> 07:33.780
Oh, I love that quote.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.181
Run with that.

07:34.581 --> 07:34.701
Yeah.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.322
Let me say it again.

07:35.362 --> 07:36.163
No, no, that's right.

07:36.183 --> 07:39.726
I get it the first time, but I like what you're talking about.

07:40.263 --> 07:42.706
The man says, ooh, I'm working on that.

07:43.046 --> 07:47.271
Stephen Jay Gould tells me he can't work from anything but the real stuff.

07:47.351 --> 07:47.651
Oh, yeah.

07:47.691 --> 07:48.272
He has a book.

07:48.452 --> 07:56.481
He came out and gave a lecture, and he started talking about somebody that I thought only a book collector's would know about that.

07:56.501 --> 07:58.023
I'm seeing his collection now in Soho.

07:58.323 --> 07:59.444
Well, he gave me his address.

07:59.544 --> 08:01.226
I haven't been to see him yet.

08:01.306 --> 08:01.987
It's on Green Street.

08:02.007 --> 08:04.470
And he said, you got an original of Archbishop Usher?

08:05.311 --> 08:07.974
He said, oh, yeah.

08:07.994 --> 08:10.236
Usher is the guy we should be celebrating.

08:10.823 --> 08:15.670
that said the world was created in 4004, so this is the 6,000... That's the T.S.'

08:15.650 --> 08:16.010
's, right?

08:16.491 --> 08:18.994
Yeah, U.S.S.H.E.R.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.076
Not bad, right?

08:20.396 --> 08:21.578
Yeah.

08:22.259 --> 08:36.980
Anyway, so a long time ago, when I was first beginning to collect all this stuff one way and another, somebody said to me, well, you're interested in that just for what it tells you about today, right?

08:37.360 --> 08:39.463
Because it gives you a perspective on today.

08:39.950 --> 08:49.141
A long time ago, when I was teaching, when I taught at Connecticut College from 68 to 84, some time in there.

08:49.282 --> 08:51.845
So you were already professionally formed, shall we say?

08:51.865 --> 09:07.965
Well, in terms of, I started in high school collecting things, and then in college, whenever Northfield, Minnesota, not too much 18th century stuff was floating around loose, but occasionally I would find an English piece in the library for a duplicate sale.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.706
I wouldn't be pleased about that now, but I was glad to buy it then.

09:14.370 --> 09:21.300
So anytime something fell my way that I could afford, I'd add it to the old grouping.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.663
I brought you some lists here so you could see.

09:25.245 --> 09:32.175
And so this person said, well, you buy this just so you understand today better, you know, having a very modern utilitarian ring to all this.

09:32.796 --> 09:36.501
And finally I learned to say, no, not at all, absolutely not.

09:36.818 --> 09:39.782
These things are just interesting for themselves.

09:39.842 --> 09:46.330
That's like saying a Bach fugue helps me understand the New York subway or problems of an urban environment.

09:46.510 --> 09:47.191
No such thing.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.193
It's just a beautiful thing in itself.

09:50.194 --> 09:56.222
It can be appreciated without transforming it into some utilitarian link to something else.

09:57.203 --> 10:04.412
This is not to say it doesn't make connections or have interesting aspects, but that, I think, is a very interesting thing.

10:04.932 --> 10:26.400
thing about what you're doing that is if I collect federal furniture obviously I can sit on it I can use it at home it has a utilitarian value it's pretty it's nice it's also valuable and when I'm done with it I can sell it or do any other thing if I collect medieval bronzes I

10:26.785 --> 10:30.550
I can look at them in a case to a limit, but I can't sit down.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.672
They don't have that.

10:31.732 --> 10:38.562
I can substitute this for something that otherwise would come from Woolworths or a department store or a current manufacturer at all.

10:40.825 --> 10:52.101
With books, I think, and book people, I really believe that you walk in a room and you walk in a room

10:52.975 --> 10:59.483
And as one of the writers on the decorative arts said in the 1870s, what you see in a room tells you what's in a mind.

11:00.043 --> 11:01.405
Oh, I like to see.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.087
Well, it's true.

11:03.768 --> 11:15.342
This lady said, if you want to be impressive, make sure you have a bust of Napoleon and a few grapes and a picture of Jesus and, you know, all kinds of things to show the multiple facets of your mind.

11:16.603 --> 11:19.607
And if you say a room represents a mind,

11:19.942 --> 11:21.665
That's a scary thing sometimes.

11:22.546 --> 11:23.949
Do you believe that you subscribe to him?

11:24.269 --> 11:24.510
I do.

11:26.012 --> 11:26.272
I do.

11:26.473 --> 11:32.122
I think that people often surround themselves with what interests them.

11:32.142 --> 11:46.506
And when I met a historian who had a reproduction map of, I don't know, Denmark or Germany or something on his wall, I would have dated about 1740, 1790.

11:47.380 --> 11:49.503
A historian, an academic historian, right?

11:49.523 --> 11:50.944
And I said, what is this map?

11:51.124 --> 11:52.286
And he said, I don't know.

11:52.306 --> 11:53.567
It just was decorative.

11:53.808 --> 11:58.954
I knew something about that historian, in terms of his basic curiosity of the environment 10 feet around him.

12:02.578 --> 12:09.687
But you go to houses, and people, more than they realize, reveal themselves by what they have sitting around.

12:13.631 --> 12:16.695
When I was a book reviewer, we'll go beyond that.

12:18.464 --> 12:21.709
You know, you'd like to know what people wanted to read beside their books.

12:22.170 --> 12:22.630
Yes.

12:23.011 --> 12:25.354
And that's really privileged information.

12:25.375 --> 12:32.365
I decided, you know, you really do know, you really know a person by their reading habits.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.849
When this is what they want to read or they want to collect.

12:38.114 --> 12:46.767
The interesting thing about collecting the way I do, and I will just tell you, I really mean my motto,

12:47.692 --> 12:49.395
It doesn't scan well dramatically.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.858
Anything I can find cheap, 18th century, I'll buy.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.145
Is anything.

12:56.165 --> 13:07.843
Any country, any... Japan, China, Europe... Why do some people like vanilla and not chocolate?

13:09.445 --> 13:11.809
Well, the 18th is easier, it's closer.

13:11.992 --> 13:23.631
I suppose it's a fascination formed as a child with Williamsburg, Philadelphia, the revolution, colonial American history, but oddly doesn't go back to the 1600s as vigorously.

13:24.493 --> 13:37.594
But as a fascination with the music, with the art, the architecture, virtually every aspect of what seems to be still the classic taste, and that is

13:38.165 --> 13:39.748
Just look around this room.

13:39.908 --> 13:47.041
Now, it borders from, I suppose, the Biedermeyer to the, you know, that's a non-Pierre light.

13:47.121 --> 13:51.870
This is shades of a 17th century ceiling.

13:52.238 --> 13:56.144
I suppose it averages after the 18th century, one way or another.

13:56.826 --> 13:58.889
Let me just interrupt for a second.

13:59.069 --> 14:04.999
Kirsten, instead of you getting a book and sending it to me, why don't you just write down who I should describe it to it?

14:05.019 --> 14:05.680
I get books at home.

14:05.941 --> 14:07.203
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

14:07.283 --> 14:07.904
Does that make more sense?

14:07.924 --> 14:09.246
Yeah, let me just start right now.

14:11.129 --> 14:14.415
Then I'll give you a check right in a second.

14:14.455 --> 14:15.196
To William Horne.

14:15.857 --> 14:17.520
William Horne.

14:18.057 --> 14:46.798
libraries are and remain libraries are and remain a place for books a place to not only learn facts but experience cultural artifacts that is it's one thing to know that as sometimes said virgil was the great classic author of one century herodota or horus the great classic weatherman 18th century and you

14:47.251 --> 15:05.333
You take out the editions, and you fold out the plates, and you look at the printing, and it's red and black, and it's interesting, and you see the notes, and you see the students' notes, and it's all very different from reading one of the Harvard classics, or reading a modern zippy paperback translation, when you actually touch the stuff of another century.

15:05.353 --> 15:11.059
It's like Addison's essay on coins and metals as being basic to the library of a gentleman.

15:11.079 --> 15:13.663
That's just how you know something about the Greeks and the Romans.

15:13.703 --> 15:15.705
You have several drawers full of it.

15:16.563 --> 15:33.522
So I took out this 1775 book, beautiful little gem of a thing, a tiny French book, as they did, kind of do a decimal size, and it was five dollars, leather bound, complete.

15:33.542 --> 15:37.707
It had one on the spine, so they probably thought it was an odd volume, but it was complete in itself.

15:39.068 --> 15:43.093
And I checked the price just to make sure it wasn't a 1910 price.

15:43.715 --> 15:44.236
Nope.

15:44.256 --> 15:45.777
They said, that's ours, $5.

15:45.817 --> 15:46.658
So I showed it to him.

15:46.698 --> 15:48.901
He kept looking at it, looking at it with great delight.

15:49.441 --> 15:50.663
This is a horn.

15:50.723 --> 15:51.624
Mr. Horn, yes.

15:51.784 --> 16:02.116
And then I pulled out something that I had saw for several years and finally had found in Minnesota, James Bond's Birds of the Caribbean.

16:02.156 --> 16:07.081
Well, if you know the secret agent, Fleming actually named him.

16:07.101 --> 16:08.143
He was writing the stories.

16:08.183 --> 16:09.064
He was stumped.

16:09.104 --> 16:10.245
He had the character down.

16:10.546 --> 16:11.827
but he needed a name.

16:11.848 --> 16:12.448
That's great.

16:12.468 --> 16:12.909
I don't know this.

16:13.029 --> 16:25.604
And on his coffee table or someplace in his house, I think at Jamaica, was a book on Birds of the Caribbean by James Bond, who I think is American, not even English, ornithologist.

16:25.644 --> 16:28.427
How many Bond collectors would pay thousands of dollars?

16:28.447 --> 16:29.829
$12.50.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.231
This is a later edition.

16:32.251 --> 16:34.114
If they knew this, they'd have to have that book.

16:34.134 --> 16:35.075
Oh, yeah, exactly.

16:35.215 --> 16:37.077
So I pulled it out.

16:37.445 --> 16:43.633
And I handed it to Mr. Horne, and he said, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:44.214 --> 16:48.400
And I'm still not sure whether he knew the James Bond story, I mean, the movie story.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.703
He said, oh, yes, Bond's Bird of the Caribbean.

16:50.823 --> 16:51.304
I have this.

16:51.344 --> 16:51.865
I'm a birder.

16:52.586 --> 16:53.807
I'm very interested in birds.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.170
Now, is this the first edition or the second edition?

16:56.210 --> 16:58.393
Now, what was the point of this little show on television?

16:58.614 --> 16:59.114
I don't know.

16:59.215 --> 17:04.201
It's just the kind of enthusiasm people share, whether others want it or not.

17:04.442 --> 17:06.945
But you didn't know yet whether or not he was a book man.

17:07.313 --> 17:10.416
No, I didn't, but it turned out he was a book fanatic.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.759
You've just kind of flown your fly on the water here, right?

17:13.779 --> 17:13.940
Yes.

17:14.420 --> 17:21.687
Many people come in and say, gee, the Bears really did great last night, or didn't the Expos do well?

17:22.288 --> 17:22.648
Did they?

17:22.668 --> 17:23.189
I don't know.

17:24.450 --> 17:26.572
Let me show you what I found here from 1720.

17:26.692 --> 17:29.815
I mean, that's my version of a sports story.

17:29.955 --> 17:32.798
So I'm...

17:33.149 --> 17:35.953
we're talking about libraries, so I wanted to show him that.

17:35.993 --> 17:41.341
Well, not only did he know about Pond, he had used it, and he had several editions himself.

17:41.401 --> 17:45.086
He'd been to Jamaica, he'd been to Trinidad, looking at Burns, using this book.

17:45.987 --> 17:50.073
And so there was a good deal of back and forth, whether it was a first edition or not.

17:51.435 --> 17:57.664
And we later went down the hall to look at his office to see whether he had it, and it was at home.

17:59.126 --> 18:01.249
But before I left,

18:02.073 --> 18:07.838
I said, where are there any other bookshops right around here?

18:08.258 --> 18:10.921
Just like me, you know.

18:10.941 --> 18:12.342
My plane doesn't go until 315.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.404
He said, well, look at Leon's on 9th Street, Minneapolis.

18:15.425 --> 18:19.948
So I went into Leon's, and it turns out there are two of them, Mr. and Mrs., each run a shop.

18:20.429 --> 18:26.774
So Mr. sent me to one after I'd found some very interesting books with him.

18:28.356 --> 18:31.118
And Mrs.,

18:32.060 --> 18:35.203
said, I said, do you have a cookery section?

18:36.184 --> 18:36.785
A what section?

18:36.825 --> 18:37.165
Cookery.

18:38.887 --> 18:43.431
And I said, as she said, you'll see it's a very small world here.

18:43.451 --> 18:47.154
So this is how the Louise F. Murray connection comes together years later again.

18:48.035 --> 18:50.217
No, this is not years later, last week.

18:51.278 --> 18:51.999
It came.

18:52.119 --> 18:54.421
So, I mean, this is just a week and a half ago.

18:54.962 --> 18:57.284
So, do you have a cookery section?

18:57.845 --> 18:58.185
Yes.

18:58.385 --> 19:07.995
There was a very nice man named Zathmer, who used to come in here all the time and look at the cookery section, and his wife, she was Japanese.

19:08.215 --> 19:11.258
I think her name was Saba or Sada or something like that.

19:11.298 --> 19:16.343
She would come in very patiently and finally say, Louis, don't you think you've looked at those enough now?

19:16.423 --> 19:19.967
Couldn't we go home?

19:20.968 --> 19:23.771
And both people knew Mr. Horn.

19:24.431 --> 19:28.155
What the point is, in the...

19:29.013 --> 19:32.738
first place I went, because he sent me, and we talked about birth.

19:33.319 --> 19:40.729
Here was a book, four volumes, British Ornithology, or British Zoology, 1768-1770.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.294
It'll take me a minute to come.

19:45.095 --> 19:48.960
Thomas Pennant, P-N-N-A-N-T, is the author.

19:50.002 --> 19:53.947
This is the kind of symmetry there is in the world.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.489
So I called him up, all excited.

19:55.529 --> 19:58.834
The next day I said, thank you, thank you, thank you for sending me to this

19:59.118 --> 20:01.801
book, to this bookshop.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.322
I told him about this set.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.546
And I said, there's so many engravings of birds that I thought I might copy for you.

20:07.566 --> 20:09.428
Tell me, what's your favorite bird?

20:10.349 --> 20:12.531
Well, the Dartford Warbler.

20:13.432 --> 20:15.094
I never heard of the Dartford Warbler.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.475
Probably neither did you.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.759
And so I said, okay, I'll see if I can find a Dartford Warbler.

20:21.780 --> 20:26.725
Well, wonder of wonders, this book was finished in 1770, the fourth volume.

20:27.506 --> 20:28.467
The guy who wrote it

20:28.818 --> 20:32.983
was the very man who described the category of warlords in 1773.

20:34.205 --> 20:39.331
And there's just a kind of weird serendipity in all of this that makes life much more interesting.

20:40.273 --> 20:45.319
It's weirdly incomprehensible to those who don't belong to this club, you know.

20:46.060 --> 20:51.407
It happens more often than it doesn't.

20:51.427 --> 20:51.687
It happens.

20:52.190 --> 20:56.037
I call it, you know, and of course it sounds spiritual, but it's not.

20:56.077 --> 21:01.245
I mean, I sometimes feel there's a hand directing me, ledging me to something.

21:01.406 --> 21:01.806
I have it.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.010
I used to think it was a joke.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.212
Have you ever... Did you feel that?

21:05.232 --> 21:06.635
I mean, sometimes it's eerie.

21:06.655 --> 21:09.419
I mean, I'll be at home thinking I need something.

21:09.459 --> 21:10.481
I'm writing.

21:10.882 --> 21:13.126
And it's frustrating.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.750
And look, and it's...

21:16.051 --> 21:18.935
Right there, and you were looking for it for three years.

21:18.975 --> 21:19.916
Wilmarth Lewis.

21:19.956 --> 21:21.298
Have you ever read Wilmarth Lewis?

21:21.318 --> 21:21.818
He's in my book.

21:21.838 --> 21:21.939
Okay.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.443
He's one of the few people who wrote three autobiographies.

21:26.464 --> 21:29.688
Did you ever go to his place when he was alive?

21:29.809 --> 21:31.471
Not while he was alive.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.272
But it's still there.

21:32.332 --> 21:32.712
I did.

21:32.772 --> 21:34.114
It was a magical experience.

21:34.194 --> 21:34.835
Farmington's.

21:34.855 --> 21:35.676
Robbery Hill.

21:36.417 --> 21:37.078
Here's a guy.

21:37.098 --> 21:39.561
I love this kind of people.

21:39.811 --> 21:41.933
who pulls out a shelf list.

21:41.953 --> 21:43.815
He had a card catalog then.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.217
And you pull it out and it's practically solid pink.

21:46.878 --> 21:51.322
And he said, this is a list of my 18th century prints.

21:51.342 --> 21:56.407
The ones with the pink overlay are the ones the British Museum doesn't have.

21:56.427 --> 21:58.609
You know, that kind of two-fisted, oh boy.

21:58.630 --> 22:02.453
That's Sam Berger with his Moller's collection out there in Carmel.

22:02.473 --> 22:05.877
It blows everybody away with what he has and what they don't have.

22:05.897 --> 22:08.299
Well, I thought it was mystic funny.

22:08.971 --> 22:21.478
when I read Lewis's biographies, that he would go to a party, go to a house, and he knew somehow he just intuited

22:22.353 --> 22:28.559
that there were Walpole items in the house, and it was as though they had a mystic magnetic attraction.

22:28.579 --> 22:29.881
And I believe that.

22:29.981 --> 22:35.827
It's as though over there behind that piano, if we just look in that bookcase, we're going to find one.

22:35.987 --> 22:39.951
And he would get up, and the hosts would sometimes look aghast.

22:39.971 --> 22:45.837
He would actually move something and pull out a book, aha, this belonged to Walpole himself.

22:45.857 --> 22:50.521
I don't have a Walpole nose, but 18th century nose I do have.

22:50.622 --> 22:52.123
I was in a bookshop in Denver.

22:53.302 --> 22:57.487
See, how did that stuff show up in places like Denver and Minneapolis?

22:57.507 --> 22:58.508
Well, here's the point.

22:58.589 --> 23:01.212
I don't know.

23:01.232 --> 23:03.294
It just travels in clumps.

23:04.095 --> 23:08.961
I went in the shop, and I said to the man, do you have any 18th century things?

23:09.042 --> 23:14.088
And, of course, usually they think they mean Oxford Press reprints of Dr. Johnson or something like that.

23:14.108 --> 23:15.990
I said, no, something printed in the 18th century.

23:16.030 --> 23:18.113
No, I haven't taken it.

23:18.133 --> 23:21.537
And I looked around, and I said, there is something here.

23:22.968 --> 23:39.945
And in a few minutes, I had a quarto by Robert Sanderson, a piece on mathematics, big piece, one of two volumes, very sad shape, but on algebra, 1740, as a professor at Cambridge.

23:39.965 --> 23:41.326
I said, look what I found.

23:41.527 --> 23:42.648
You didn't have one, but you do.

23:43.248 --> 23:43.789
20 bucks.

23:44.430 --> 23:46.031
Nice.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.874
It's really great that you can get these things.

23:49.208 --> 24:01.200
And then a week ago after, well, before we went to Minneapolis, we were in Northfield, Minnesota.

24:01.220 --> 24:03.563
I went to Carleton down there.

24:03.843 --> 24:08.428
Carleton didn't have any bookshops in the 60s when I was there, or at Northfield, but does now.

24:09.269 --> 24:11.991
And I went in and I said, do you have any 18th century material?

24:13.012 --> 24:16.096
And he said, no, we don't have anything.

24:16.116 --> 24:17.477
I said, well, that one's there.

24:18.352 --> 24:19.473
You got one right there?

24:20.214 --> 24:21.516
It's 18th century or earlier.

24:23.798 --> 24:26.782
That's before you even picked it up.

24:26.802 --> 24:27.983
Didn't even have to open the case.

24:29.986 --> 24:31.748
Can you judge a book by its cover?

24:32.188 --> 24:33.410
Absolutely.

24:34.150 --> 24:35.372
No question.

24:35.412 --> 24:39.837
People who think you can't don't know what they're talking about.

24:40.438 --> 24:44.022
So I said, that's 18th century, so we got it out in 1749.

24:44.609 --> 24:58.003
Very interesting, the only 18th century English book I've ever seen found in vellum, as though it were a 17th century Italian.

25:00.586 --> 25:04.730
Not polished vellum, it's kind of rough, almost sweaty, but it is vellum.

25:05.391 --> 25:10.937
And so we made a deal for that one, and it's Virgil's Bucallax, and I have it now.

25:11.103 --> 25:21.337
Do you catalogue this stuff when you take it home or is it more... It was getting out of control.

25:21.357 --> 25:23.059
Is it a casual collection?

25:23.079 --> 25:29.408
It's casual in terms of acquisition, but I hope rather more organized once I get home.

25:29.428 --> 25:37.178
I do have several foci, but the interesting thing is when you bring in simply what nature offers,

25:37.597 --> 25:40.741
Very often.

25:40.761 --> 25:43.385
Then you begin to see more about a time period.

25:43.866 --> 25:53.419
You may not look for books on gardens or architecture, but if you begin to have them, and you look at them, and you pour over them, then you see more about architecture and gardens in the whole period.

25:53.439 --> 25:54.261
That's more interesting.

25:54.281 --> 25:57.786
This is normal stuff for an Orientalist.

25:58.266 --> 26:04.515
I'll tell you about my Japanese books in a minute, but...

26:06.031 --> 26:26.374
in Asian studies, China and Japan, there's a deep belief that calligraphy, poetry, art, culture, architecture, history, literature, all are a kind of almost like they're a gem.

26:27.175 --> 26:34.063
And when you talk about any one of those things, you are simply looking at one facet of the whole gem, which amounts to the total culture.

26:35.107 --> 26:38.770
In European and American studies, we don't see things quite that way.

26:38.790 --> 26:45.537
We think that science is divorced from art and tend to be more departmental or categorical.

26:47.498 --> 26:55.726
But the more you know, the more unity there is, and the more interesting things you find simply because you're operating outside the normal area.

26:55.986 --> 26:58.128
Now, I brought a couple of showing tells for you.

26:59.109 --> 27:02.532
One of the things that intrigued me about

27:03.676 --> 27:13.566
Your account of Louie kind of pushed me over the edge was all these cookery things that he had.

27:13.586 --> 27:22.314
We had another alum of Illinois Wesleyan who I got to know, John Gurney, and he was a great cookbook collector.

27:23.756 --> 27:33.345
Cagle at Louie has come out with one volume that thick that's a bibliography of the Gurney Cookbooks, and he's now about to come out with a second one.

27:33.545 --> 27:43.241
Well, knowing Gernon, then reading about Patmery, that's kind of the current version of my cookery stuff from the 1680s.

27:46.386 --> 28:00.328
So, cookery and then food books, or garden books, that goes along with it.

28:01.287 --> 28:05.312
So you can just see the kind of things I've been able to pick up here.

28:05.833 --> 28:11.059
One of the things I resist is if you already have one book, is there any reason you shouldn't acquire another?

28:11.079 --> 28:17.067
Do you have an island garden?

28:17.087 --> 28:17.267
No.

28:17.287 --> 28:18.268
Do you know the book?

28:18.669 --> 28:18.869
No.

28:19.009 --> 28:19.770
You don't know the book?

28:19.790 --> 28:20.351
No, no.

28:20.812 --> 28:23.515
See, you faxed his book with it has some color.

28:23.849 --> 28:25.892
Oh, Siri Baxter.

28:28.156 --> 28:29.678
It's called An Island Gardener.

28:29.698 --> 28:30.439
It's Appledore.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.340
It's wonderful.

28:31.421 --> 28:40.735
No, but my son went to the island a couple of years ago.

28:41.496 --> 28:44.220
He just graduated from Andover.

28:44.605 --> 28:48.308
I never saw a kid so taken with anything so interesting.

28:48.368 --> 28:50.850
I never had heard of Celia Thaxter.

28:50.910 --> 28:51.991
He was transfixed.

28:52.071 --> 29:00.418
I was going to write a... So anyway, what am I saying here?

29:02.620 --> 29:05.843
Oh, so these are a couple of the things that I have.

29:06.043 --> 29:08.565
I also am very interested in musical things.

29:09.826 --> 29:14.190
In another life, I'd have been probably, if I had a pick, Trevor Pinnock.

29:14.508 --> 29:21.355
who is one of the great English harpsichord players, but he also has his little own group.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.038
I have a great interest in music.

29:25.460 --> 29:35.150
I probably don't have too many music collectors in your group, but I didn't bring this for you to... Keith, if you can look at it, I don't have a new version of this.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.352
This is the music that I have.

29:37.512 --> 29:40.195
This is the antiquarian music.

29:40.816 --> 29:44.442
That's just my running list, so I know what I have and I don't have.

29:46.264 --> 29:52.274
But I've got all of Corelli and a lot of the Valdi and Handel in 18th century printings.

29:54.076 --> 29:57.502
So you have a computer file for this?

29:57.942 --> 30:01.308
Is it a database?

30:01.909 --> 30:07.397
Well, some of my record keepers are databases, but this is just a straight

30:07.563 --> 30:11.207
text thing, and I put them in alphabetically, and it has a search function.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.007
It's where it's perfect.

30:12.027 --> 30:12.908
You can search that.

30:12.988 --> 30:15.891
So that works pretty well for me.

30:17.252 --> 30:19.114
But it keeps me from buying triples.

30:20.295 --> 30:22.277
Doubles happen every now and then.

30:22.297 --> 30:23.498
So you don't carry this with you.

30:24.259 --> 30:31.566
Well, you know, sometimes if I'm going to a place where I know there's going to be a lot of cookery or a lot of this or a lot of that, I'll bring one of these lists along.

30:32.647 --> 30:35.410
But most of the time I don't.

30:36.605 --> 30:38.888
I'm being interested in music.

30:40.329 --> 30:47.158
I am fascinated by the process of early music.

30:47.238 --> 30:48.840
My watch is 15 minutes fast.

30:48.860 --> 30:53.065
In terms of the face, I think you have the same... Oh, it's a Rolex.

30:53.625 --> 30:55.227
Yours is a fancier one.

30:55.247 --> 30:57.450
Mine is about 20 years old.

30:57.470 --> 31:00.433
Mine is 28 years old.

31:00.513 --> 31:01.034
1968.

31:01.174 --> 31:04.418
I got this in graduate school.

31:07.233 --> 31:13.483
Well, my parents gave me this when I was finishing up at Princeton.

31:13.643 --> 31:22.738
I've worn it every day since, save for when it wasn't screwed in and I got salt water, and that didn't work too well.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.864
Anyway, so I'm interested in the music.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.772
Particularly, I've been fascinated by...

31:32.140 --> 31:34.063
Early violins, early music.

31:34.163 --> 31:46.221
I have a 1787 harpsichord, and what I've come to call my orchestra with no players, about 14 violins, three violas, two cellos, a bunch of other stuff.

31:46.241 --> 31:46.983
Do you play any of these?

31:47.103 --> 31:53.753
The harpsichord I do, and I'm beginning to attract a few players now, doing English things.

31:53.953 --> 32:00.443
There's an amazing wealth of particularly English 18th century music,

32:00.575 --> 32:02.417
but no one knows anything about.

32:03.078 --> 32:05.180
So you collect these?

32:05.200 --> 32:05.921
Yeah.

32:06.782 --> 32:17.334
One of the fascinating aspects of collecting a bunch of things is you see lots of things that perhaps other people don't realize much about.

32:17.874 --> 32:19.536
There's a wonderful line from Holmes.

32:20.717 --> 32:24.442
Watson says, well, Holmes, I was with you the entire time.

32:24.502 --> 32:26.284
How did you see all this?

32:27.145 --> 32:29.367
And Holmes says, my dear Dr. Watson,

32:30.157 --> 32:31.739
We saw the same things.

32:31.899 --> 32:33.582
I simply observed them differently.

32:36.005 --> 32:40.711
So the more things you see in a different way, the more observations you're ready to make.

32:41.572 --> 32:48.181
We're doing a... Illinois Wesleyan is doing an exchange relation.

32:48.201 --> 32:54.830
We're hoping to send a couple of our kids each year to Pembroke College, Oxford, as visiting students.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.432
That's Dr. Johnson's college.

32:56.492 --> 32:57.193
It's also...

32:57.612 --> 33:02.280
Sir William Blackstone's college, and that's working out very interestingly.

33:02.701 --> 33:04.064
We're going to start next year.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.727
Can I just interrupt for a second?

33:05.767 --> 33:05.987
Yeah.

33:06.768 --> 33:10.896
The gentleman I had lunch with today, Abel Burland, have you ever heard of him?

33:10.916 --> 33:11.016
Sure.

33:11.036 --> 33:13.440
Caxton, Caxton, Caxton, and Caxton.

33:13.601 --> 33:18.670
Abel's second folio of Shakespeare, his first folio was signed by John Dryden.

33:18.690 --> 33:21.595
His second folio, the prokonans, is absolutely all the way through.

33:22.115 --> 33:28.263
John's the one that Johnson used to prepare the... Right, the lives of the poets?

33:28.383 --> 33:32.629
The man's fingerprints are... I've handled this book.

33:32.989 --> 33:46.046
I mean, if you can't get a kick out of something like this... Well, I mean, that's the kind of talismanic thing, you know, put their hand on the object and enter another era that you just can't get with a computer screen.

33:47.488 --> 33:47.768
Well...

33:48.085 --> 33:49.046
There's a line for you.

33:49.246 --> 33:58.176
Talismanic object that you just can't get with a computer screen.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.322
But you go back to the music.

34:05.725 --> 34:09.088
I was in London this summer.

34:09.829 --> 34:15.055
I used to think, you know, this is, when I started out in this, people would tell me,

34:16.064 --> 34:20.891
Now make sure, if you're going to buy books, always buy beautiful copies.

34:21.552 --> 34:23.635
Every page there, beautiful bindings.

34:23.695 --> 34:27.020
Spend as much as you can for the fewest number of books.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.024
I am the absolute antithesis of that.

34:30.044 --> 34:35.371
As I told a friend of mine, you collect bindings, I collect books.

34:35.392 --> 34:37.695
I don't care if they have a cover.

34:38.276 --> 34:40.659
Yeah, that's not an antiquarian attitude.

34:40.679 --> 34:41.380
Well...

34:41.630 --> 34:45.816
Well, it is, and this one friend I think of, he has the most elegant quartos.

34:45.876 --> 34:51.304
He's decided to focus on quartos, and if you want to have an eat-your-heart-out day, you look at what he has.

34:51.504 --> 34:55.169
Are you looking at the findings, or are you looking at the content?

34:55.189 --> 35:00.837
Well, you're looking at both, and you think these are really lovely, whereas...

35:01.103 --> 35:02.545
Mine may not have covers.

35:02.645 --> 35:06.030
They're very wormy, and a page or two may be missing, but I haven't.

35:06.670 --> 35:10.656
So could it be really quite irrelevant to you, or is it even if the word is too strong?

35:10.676 --> 35:18.026
Well, again, it all depends on condition and price.

35:18.066 --> 35:30.402
I would much rather, well, ideally you want a brilliant book for minimal price, but the best of all possible worlds is five books you really want at the price of one in pristine condition.

35:31.073 --> 35:32.615
where you don't want them on.

35:33.577 --> 35:46.775
But to go back to the music thing, when I was in London, a book dealer or a music dealer had made me an offer, which we were able to come to terms.

35:47.897 --> 35:51.462
She had said, I have a group of miscellaneous parts from the 18th century.

35:52.353 --> 35:53.074
Miscellaneous?

35:53.274 --> 35:53.615
Parts.

35:53.835 --> 35:54.296
Parts.

35:54.316 --> 36:01.928
You know, if you've got an orchestra, you've got a couple of violins, violas and cellos and basses and horns and flutes and things.

36:02.950 --> 36:07.457
So you may have the flute part, but not the rest of the piece.

36:08.419 --> 36:12.485
And you go back to the old maxim and collect things that are complete and perfect.

36:13.868 --> 36:16.572
If you look at the catalogs of Who's Got Music,

36:16.872 --> 36:21.377
you see that occasionally the British Museum is just happy to have the viola part.

36:21.397 --> 36:25.041
They don't have anything else from this symphony.

36:25.061 --> 36:27.724
They're just happy to have whatever fragment they've got.

36:29.485 --> 36:36.593
I remember once in Dijon, here was a Viotti symphony lacking one part.

36:36.713 --> 36:37.534
I didn't buy it.

36:38.315 --> 36:42.679
One out of the twelve.

36:42.699 --> 36:46.103
That was a very bad mistake because that's near complete.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.387
with 12 parts.

36:48.447 --> 36:52.532
I'm finding more and more, you just take what you can get.

36:52.552 --> 36:59.360
And this lady had a stack that high for me, which I bought with the greatest of delight.

37:00.301 --> 37:07.189
And when I came back, all this has something to do with Pembroke College, I discovered that I had the concertos of Richard Mudge.

37:08.871 --> 37:15.118
Well, I began working on Mudge, about whom I knew nothing, M-U-D-G-E.

37:15.138 --> 37:16.039
And Mudge,

37:16.964 --> 37:18.586
was a graduate of Pembroke College.

37:18.986 --> 37:19.387
About when?

37:20.228 --> 37:21.950
1720s or 30s.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.692
His father was a friend of Johnson.

37:25.194 --> 37:26.656
Was his name familiar to you?

37:26.916 --> 37:27.176
No.

37:27.437 --> 37:32.503
Well, I think I'd heard it as one of the very, very lesser known British composers.

37:32.523 --> 37:38.550
But the people at Pembroke College, when I called them a few weeks ago, seemed to know nothing of much whatsoever.

37:39.155 --> 37:43.479
You know more about him than... Well, I've just been lucky.

37:43.619 --> 37:44.480
I've just been lucky.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.982
I get these things, and I get curious about what I have.

37:48.043 --> 37:51.305
He's lost, but he's found at the same time.

37:51.365 --> 37:52.947
Other people have reprinted him.

37:52.967 --> 37:54.168
You can get it in a Xerox.

37:55.369 --> 38:07.179
I don't have a complete set, and I know a man in England who can provide the missing parts, but the point is that he was a bit lost to his own college at Pembroke.

38:07.199 --> 38:08.740
I hope we can do something about that.

38:09.597 --> 38:36.651
by playing him or doing very interesting i mean he had heard handle on many occasions when you when you play through some of the things he has but um that's the wondrous thing about bringing home a pile of miscellaneous stuff you don't really know what it is sorting through it and just seeing what you've got i mean there are cynics and i'm not one of them who might say well maybe much

38:37.745 --> 38:42.251
You know, we talk about the evolution of species.

38:42.451 --> 38:45.355
You know, the rightfully obscure Richard Mudd.

38:47.197 --> 38:48.679
And I'm not saying one way or the other.

38:48.699 --> 38:50.761
For the antiquarian, there's an old joke.

38:51.442 --> 38:53.044
Beethoven, Beethoven.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.668
Wasn't he a contemporary of Albrecht's Berger?

38:55.988 --> 38:56.589
I think so.

38:57.630 --> 39:00.354
That kind of thing.

39:01.095 --> 39:03.077
But look at it this way.

39:03.833 --> 39:07.759
And this is where I have to go back on what I said.

39:07.819 --> 39:10.182
Does the ancient tell you anything about the modern?

39:11.685 --> 39:18.395
There are two people about whom no one knows very much at all in the general public.

39:18.895 --> 39:22.441
One is Joseph de Bologna, Chevalier Saint-Georges.

39:23.602 --> 39:25.525
I'll spell that out for you if you want it later.

39:25.545 --> 39:30.853
And the other is Ignacio Sanchez, S-A-N-C-H-E-D.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.871
Both of them are musicians of the 18th century.

39:35.413 --> 39:37.996
Sanchez wrote just a few little minuets.

39:38.196 --> 39:42.902
Whom you discovered as a collector, or that you mean as a star?

39:42.922 --> 39:47.847
Well, as a kind of... I'm officially, you see, a PhD in political science.

39:48.007 --> 39:50.891
I'm full of curiosity about things musical.

39:51.692 --> 39:57.458
And so I found him, and also the Chevalier Saint-Georges.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.722
Well...

40:03.031 --> 40:03.892
Let's see.

40:04.052 --> 40:09.881
Sanchez published in 1775 in London some minuets and dances.

40:10.782 --> 40:17.632
Chevalier Saint-Georges was a great multi-talented character in Louis XVI's France.

40:17.732 --> 40:25.022
He was a swordsman, he was a dancer, he was a composer, he was an army officer, very much a man about town.

40:25.964 --> 40:27.465
He was a writer.

40:27.646 --> 40:29.668
He was virtually everything.

40:29.688 --> 40:33.231
I mean, literally, he was going out in a competition.

40:33.251 --> 40:39.517
I don't know what kind of sword fighting they did without killing people, but he was very good at it.

40:40.358 --> 40:43.941
The interesting thing is he was born in the Caribbean.

40:44.402 --> 40:45.883
He was half black.

40:46.784 --> 40:48.285
His mother was a slave.

40:48.486 --> 40:49.867
His father was a French official.

40:50.487 --> 40:55.212
Sanchez was born on a slave ship as he crossed

40:55.985 --> 41:01.331
the Atlantic with his parents on the way from Africa to slavery in the New World.

41:02.393 --> 41:09.321
He later wound up in England, where one of the dukes took interest in him, and... Well, it is.

41:10.442 --> 41:16.549
And the point is that they... I was just down in Jamaica a couple of weeks ago.

41:16.589 --> 41:18.532
They don't know anything about either of these people.

41:19.553 --> 41:23.798
And this is... People who live in Jamaica.

41:23.862 --> 41:26.865
I mean, the government officials, cultural leaders.

41:27.065 --> 41:30.049
People who should know.

41:30.589 --> 41:41.661
Well, people not who should know, but who just haven't found him, who, if they find him, will find a whole depth to their culture they'd never imagined before.

41:41.982 --> 41:43.483
Take the Czechs, for example.

41:45.766 --> 41:49.650
There's a general opinion, I suppose, that Czechs came to America

41:50.204 --> 42:05.427
in the late 19th century, the 20th century, and they are basically an immigrant people of a rather late coming as the American waves of immigration go, which may be true.

42:05.447 --> 42:14.220
I'm not sure I've really worked on it, but I can tell you this, that long before a single check was present on North America,

42:15.449 --> 42:24.424
Von Hall, Stamets, and on and on the list goes of Czech composers were played in New York, Philadelphia, Boston in the 1700s.

42:24.524 --> 42:29.953
It's very interesting when you think about global Baroque.

42:29.973 --> 42:39.870
In fact, one of the most interesting pieces in this whole genre is a Scott.

42:40.525 --> 42:46.074
named William Hamilton Bird, Bird, B-I-A-D, B-I-R-D.

42:46.094 --> 42:48.318
This is coming up in an auction later this month.

42:48.398 --> 42:49.239
I may go for it.

42:49.339 --> 42:50.541
I already have a Xerox of it.

42:51.122 --> 43:05.385
He was a Scottish officer, and he went to India, Calcutta, and in 1783 or five or seven published a piece called Hindustani Heirs, which is an attempt

43:05.770 --> 43:10.938
to do just what you're doing with your little black machine here, to use a harpsichord as a tape recorder.

43:11.579 --> 43:20.774
In other words, he heard the equivalent of Ravi Shankar play native Indian music, and he tried to transcribe it for harpsichord, or at least that's what he says.

43:22.838 --> 43:24.220
Absolutely fascinating.

43:25.622 --> 43:26.864
That one's been preserved.

43:27.545 --> 43:31.592
It's quite likely there were composers in Western style in Japan

43:32.129 --> 43:44.666
in the 1600s, before the Jesuits got thrown out in the 1630s, because we know they went to Italy to study music, violins, organ, singing.

43:45.387 --> 43:46.569
They came back to Japan.

43:46.589 --> 43:47.871
They had to be doing something.

43:48.592 --> 43:51.696
But any trace of what they were actually doing is lost.

43:51.736 --> 43:55.221
So there's a whole world to be discovered out there.

43:55.281 --> 43:58.205
Herschel is one of my favorites.

44:00.848 --> 44:01.309
Herschel

44:01.694 --> 44:04.779
actually discovered the planet Uranus in 1781.

44:05.220 --> 44:06.722
He was, in fact, a musician.

44:09.727 --> 44:21.507
Well, I'm writing this book on multi-talented people, and, you know, you learn something about one area, and then you find still another.

44:21.547 --> 44:26.115
One of the things we want to work on, I hope, is

44:26.703 --> 44:34.658
is a ballad opera, Lord of the Manor, which was written by General John Burgundy at the University of Illinois, Leslie, and the music.

44:34.858 --> 44:38.244
So you're trying to get people interested in some of this stuff.

44:38.264 --> 44:45.738
You know, at some point, I would like to talk about, you know, all this, and how you bring this into the context of the universe.

44:45.838 --> 44:46.399
Do you?

44:46.666 --> 44:47.707
Well, I tried.

44:47.727 --> 44:48.448
I tried.

44:48.468 --> 44:51.891
You know, being an administrator, you're always suspect from the outset.

44:51.931 --> 44:57.015
Yeah, but you certainly influence the agenda such as it is, I would think.

44:57.696 --> 44:58.757
The attitude.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.899
I told you what I ran into with Cornell.

45:00.919 --> 45:02.981
I mean, interesting, isn't it?

45:03.661 --> 45:05.103
That's got to be coming from somewhere.

45:05.143 --> 45:06.404
I was told the trustees.

45:06.864 --> 45:07.705
Wow.

45:08.746 --> 45:11.528
Trustees usually do what administrators put in front of them.

45:11.548 --> 45:12.029
That's what you said.

45:12.089 --> 45:13.430
Can I quote you on that?

45:13.450 --> 45:13.630
No.

45:14.951 --> 45:16.213
No, I think we're all set.

45:16.233 --> 45:16.673
Thank you.

45:17.311 --> 45:23.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.922
That's usually the way it works.

45:25.022 --> 45:27.586
I mean, you can just suggest this without attribution.

45:28.527 --> 45:29.528
Of course, yeah.

45:29.548 --> 45:33.374
Because trustees come to town two or three times a year.

45:33.434 --> 45:39.362
They may take a leader of the board, stays in touch with the president, but usually in most boards, that's the way it works.

45:39.382 --> 45:46.272
I mean, he really liked this stuff.

45:46.454 --> 45:47.516
He's not smart.

45:47.596 --> 45:52.485
He's enormously wealthy.

45:52.605 --> 45:55.451
F-R-O-W-A-R-D.

45:56.773 --> 46:00.680
Which means, but check your dictionary what it means.

46:00.700 --> 46:02.464
Haven't used it in a long time.

46:02.925 --> 46:03.806
F-R-O-W-A-R-D.

46:03.866 --> 46:05.870
Is not a misspelling of forward.

46:07.954 --> 46:09.677
But most kids won't know that.

46:10.450 --> 46:18.541
So when you have somebody correcting something they do not understand and throwing away the original, history is in peril.

46:18.561 --> 46:20.103
Like that, history is in peril.

46:21.524 --> 46:22.546
That's my thought.

46:22.566 --> 46:24.749
Well, I'll tell you another one.

46:24.769 --> 46:26.090
I had a book dealer tell me.

46:26.471 --> 46:28.013
I looked at the woman in total shock.

46:28.874 --> 46:29.435
Did you tell her?

46:29.715 --> 46:30.897
This is not cool.

46:30.917 --> 46:31.478
I said, Ann.

46:31.498 --> 46:31.938
I said, Ann.

46:33.140 --> 46:34.441
Tell me this isn't happening.

46:34.461 --> 46:34.922
I said, Ann.

46:35.290 --> 46:37.973
Take it from a guy who's written the book.

46:38.053 --> 46:40.396
I said, you know, I'm a fucking mistake.

46:40.416 --> 46:41.718
What'd she say?

46:41.738 --> 46:43.700
She said, you know, we have a board.

46:44.000 --> 46:44.861
We have guidelines.

46:44.881 --> 46:46.483
And she gave me the book of the guidelines.

46:47.845 --> 46:48.946
And my feeling about it.

46:48.986 --> 46:50.648
Tell the guidelines to go take a hike.

46:51.770 --> 46:57.616
Every one of us is but a big player in the chain of history.

46:57.636 --> 47:01.922
And once we throw something out, it's gone for another century.

47:02.102 --> 47:04.825
Archaeologists got the message along the way.

47:04.940 --> 47:08.464
Now, does that sort of appall you?

47:09.165 --> 47:14.911
It happens that I stumbled upon it, but again, you talk about the unseen hand pushing you there?

47:15.111 --> 47:17.854
Well, no archaeologist would do anything like that.

47:17.895 --> 47:20.497
How can you throw anything away that's archival?

47:20.517 --> 47:27.285
Well, you see, the difference is, it used to be the librarians saw themselves as the keepers

47:27.434 --> 47:30.959
the protectors of the faculty's books.

47:30.979 --> 47:34.284
Now they see themselves as managers of information.

47:34.305 --> 47:36.508
They're intellectual fascists in many ways, aren't they?

47:36.528 --> 47:37.509
I wouldn't say fascists.

47:37.549 --> 47:42.998
They see themselves as managers of information, as keepers of facts rather than protectors of wisdom.

47:43.979 --> 47:54.235
And the idea that the addition, the printing, the visual presentation,

47:54.552 --> 48:01.440
may carry something apart from the words of the text is a point lost on some librarians.

48:01.460 --> 48:16.216
I once had a library candidate tell me no one needed the National Union catalog, that all useful bibliographic data was in the computer databases.

48:16.276 --> 48:23.985
You don't need to know how many copies there were or any of those fussy things who could own this copy or that copy.

48:24.455 --> 48:29.985
You know, you may sometimes get a basic description.

48:30.105 --> 48:40.143
I must say the database is improved year by year, but still the National Union catalog is a wonderful resource.

48:40.243 --> 48:47.796
And with absolute delight, last week I bought a copy of Pollard and Redgrave, that great bibliography of books before 1640.

48:48.569 --> 48:51.493
Oh, that's the STC, right?

48:51.833 --> 48:57.021
Yeah, well, I still haven't been able to figure out how to get that one on my computer, but I'd like to.

48:58.403 --> 49:00.746
But anyway, I haven't finished about the music thing.

49:00.766 --> 49:02.007
That's all right, that's all right.

49:02.028 --> 49:03.309
But you don't mind these little things?

49:03.329 --> 49:05.172
No, no, no, my life is a divergence.

49:05.913 --> 49:07.475
But that's really true.

49:08.877 --> 49:18.390
But if you think of early music, there was a time when people thought playing Bach on the piano was really quite fine.

49:18.488 --> 49:28.490
And now most people who try to play Bach would play not only on a harpsichord, but on early versions of a violin rather than the post-1800.

49:29.673 --> 49:32.920
Well, the thing that has fascinated me... Is it a different class?

49:33.676 --> 49:35.178
It's a different sound.

49:35.539 --> 49:38.844
It's a different sound with gut strings, a slightly different violin.

49:39.024 --> 49:40.666
Would he visualize it?

49:41.167 --> 49:43.651
Oh, he might visualize it.

49:43.811 --> 49:46.314
He might recognize the tune, he'd recognize the tone.

49:46.354 --> 49:47.216
But it's not what he heard.

49:47.576 --> 49:49.018
It's not what he heard in his own mind.

49:49.399 --> 49:50.841
And that's the interesting question.

49:50.901 --> 50:02.518
If you recreate a piece of art, we can either do it as we restore a painting or restore a piece of music to what we think we would like, and inevitably that comes in in any way.

50:02.937 --> 50:04.999
any case, whether we believe it or not.

50:06.361 --> 50:24.982
Or what we think the artist had in mind, whether we like it or not, you know, this may be god-awful, but it's authentic, is one judgment, rather than this is the way I would like to play it, regardless of whether it was the way Bach did it or not.

50:25.383 --> 50:29.147
It's all summarized in, I think it was Wanda Wandauska.

50:29.532 --> 50:33.357
who began to say, you play Bach your way, I'll blame his way.

50:35.480 --> 50:35.720
I love that.

50:35.740 --> 50:38.223
Well, it's a wonderful line, and it illustrates that.

50:38.243 --> 50:39.865
Where would I find that quote?

50:39.885 --> 50:40.326
I don't know.

50:40.366 --> 50:41.687
Book on Wanda Landoska.

50:42.468 --> 50:46.233
So I began to wonder, and I've wondered about this for 20 years.

50:47.895 --> 50:57.868
If you go to Williamsburg, you see all these authentically restored houses, and you go to Chowning's Tavern, and you eat ye olde food off a

50:58.152 --> 51:05.162
Armatel plate with a guy in knee-bridges, serving something that came, that tastes like it came out of ho-cho's.

51:05.182 --> 51:08.346
And sneaking up the alley and smoking.

51:08.366 --> 51:17.359
So I began to wonder, with my penchant for things antiquarian, without the slightest use anywhere in mind for the conclusion,

51:17.828 --> 51:19.511
what was food like back then.

51:19.992 --> 51:23.958
And that's one of the reasons that I've put together this cookery collection.

51:23.998 --> 51:31.912
It's really an 18th century collection, and all these later things are things that have really come along along the way.

51:32.152 --> 51:33.735
And this is another one.

51:34.115 --> 51:36.339
So is this what led to your project?

51:36.359 --> 51:37.942
Oh, I don't know.

51:38.002 --> 51:39.044
It all goes together.

51:39.064 --> 51:40.827
To your meeting Chef Louis?

51:40.847 --> 51:42.790
Well, that's why I was really interested in

51:43.310 --> 51:44.392
and talking to him.

51:44.432 --> 51:48.920
This is called Baroque Cuisine, English Cookery in the Time of Handel and Heidel.

51:48.941 --> 51:51.666
Oh, an attempt to, you know, a cookery book.

51:51.726 --> 51:52.888
I don't know anything about cookery books.

51:52.908 --> 51:53.429
Are you working on this?

51:53.469 --> 51:55.813
Yes, but, you know, that doesn't prevent me.

51:55.833 --> 51:56.715
Have you tried to sell this?

51:56.915 --> 51:57.857
No.

51:57.877 --> 51:58.178
You should.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.360
I've finished writing it so far.

51:59.460 --> 52:00.582
Have you tried the recipes?

52:01.264 --> 52:01.544
No.

52:02.426 --> 52:06.313
Well, I've left out

52:06.935 --> 52:09.958
Well, look how many there are, and you'll see why.

52:10.178 --> 52:12.040
That's the essence of a cookbook.

52:12.820 --> 52:13.261
Or is it?

52:13.781 --> 52:22.409
You see, that's what we were persuaded about 1840 and 1850, that a cookbook is for idiots who don't know anything.

52:23.190 --> 52:30.896
And you put in a quarter teaspoon of this, a quarter teaspoon of that, and this is what the recipe is, whether you like it or not.

52:31.717 --> 52:36.081
Whereas the 18th century, in music and in food, was

52:36.280 --> 52:37.641
Here's the basic outline.

52:37.821 --> 52:42.085
Add such ornaments as you will to make the piece the way you'd like it.

52:42.765 --> 52:50.272
And when the 18th century contemporary writers produced their book, they put in, it said, add salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

52:50.632 --> 52:55.016
They didn't say anything about how much to put in.

52:55.056 --> 52:59.299
That was left to the judgment of the artist.

52:59.339 --> 53:00.640
So whose products are these?

53:00.660 --> 53:02.442
Yours or somebody else's?

53:02.462 --> 53:03.663
Did you have an interlude?

53:03.683 --> 53:04.624
No, no, no, no.

53:04.644 --> 53:06.085
I'm not that far along.

53:06.368 --> 53:07.730
Oh, the comments are all mine.

53:08.631 --> 53:10.814
This is just draft eight or whatever it is.

53:10.934 --> 53:11.335
I don't know.

53:11.896 --> 53:20.348
But I just got some interesting new books, really fancy ones from 1716 and 1730, this early period.

53:20.428 --> 53:28.279
There's a book just published by Getty, the Getty Library, which I just trust, which I just received a review copy on.

53:28.299 --> 53:30.082
It's classically cooked on this.

53:30.102 --> 53:30.963
You should know about it.

53:31.223 --> 53:31.684
And it's...

53:32.170 --> 53:37.558
There are no cookbooks from a classic area, but apparently they've culled some recipes from various sources.

53:37.578 --> 53:39.561
I haven't had a chance to study... Oh, you mean Apicius?

53:40.022 --> 53:41.204
He's a Roman food writer.

53:41.244 --> 53:44.709
He does have... There's more than one.

53:44.769 --> 53:46.111
Oh, there is?

53:46.231 --> 53:46.992
Yeah.

53:47.012 --> 53:47.854
I'll send you something.

53:48.034 --> 53:49.155
Oh, I'd love to see that.

53:49.196 --> 53:51.118
See, here are all the recipes here.

53:51.138 --> 53:55.265
It's just a pastiche of recipes from a variety of sources.

53:55.365 --> 53:58.870
And I didn't get any... I don't know.

53:59.221 --> 54:00.263
Okay, sure.

54:01.125 --> 54:07.962
See, but it's just, I read through these books, and I think, well, this one looks kind of interesting, so I put it in in the right place.

54:07.982 --> 54:09.485
Louie must have been nuts over this one.

54:09.505 --> 54:13.635
Well, he kind of liked it, but he never really, and then I thought, okay,

54:13.852 --> 54:15.334
How different are the vegetables?

54:15.394 --> 54:17.337
What kind of vegetables did they have?

54:17.817 --> 54:19.900
When I talked about soy, what did they mean?

54:19.960 --> 54:21.522
It's got nothing to do with La Choy.

54:23.284 --> 54:24.826
What meats did they have?

54:25.547 --> 54:27.169
What vegetable varieties?

54:27.269 --> 54:29.793
That is, there's no such thing as a generic pea.

54:30.113 --> 54:33.297
There's a Laxton pea, a Hotspur pea.

54:33.337 --> 54:39.285
What you have here is a work of scholarships that likes to have a good shot at the trade market.

54:39.637 --> 54:41.599
Why do I hope?

54:42.180 --> 54:44.782
That was the idea.

54:45.183 --> 54:48.626
I might actually do something practical.

54:50.108 --> 54:52.911
But see, here are the peach varieties of the 18th century.

54:53.551 --> 54:58.256
And where I know that one is still in the crate, a lot of it has disappeared altogether.

54:58.296 --> 54:59.538
Well, where have I got peas?

55:00.238 --> 55:07.686
Now, there are only two or three of the pea varieties that Jefferson actually knew that are still floating around.

55:07.953 --> 55:10.718
You know, this may be just fussy, fussy, fussy.

55:10.738 --> 55:14.544
Why do you pick the musicians to keep this?

55:14.564 --> 55:15.566
Because it's the model.

55:16.066 --> 55:16.788
It's the model.

55:17.008 --> 55:21.536
In music, it says, play this sequence of chords and ornament it as you will.

55:21.916 --> 55:24.801
That's essentially the way the 18th century story writers said.

55:24.821 --> 55:31.913
You know, you have some beef, you add some gravy, and add such sweet spices as you think are appropriate to the dish.

55:32.053 --> 55:33.235
One of them even sells.

55:33.907 --> 55:41.316
It's so clearly a musical quotation, or it's not musical, but I've got the boxing in here.

55:41.336 --> 55:45.161
You know, put it in until it feels right.

55:45.181 --> 55:58.378
I forget just where that is, but it's the parallel with recreating early music and recreating 18th century cuisine are absolutely parallel in every way.

56:01.345 --> 56:05.190
I can't find it here, what I'm thinking of.

56:05.250 --> 56:06.652
So when do you work on this?

56:06.672 --> 56:07.232
Late at night.

56:08.193 --> 56:08.734
Late at night.

56:08.754 --> 56:11.938
You know, a couple of recipes here, a couple of recipes there.

56:11.958 --> 56:14.381
And you've tried a few of these things out?

56:14.401 --> 56:14.701
Really?

56:15.382 --> 56:16.924
Are they good?

56:16.944 --> 56:17.805
I love them.

56:17.825 --> 56:18.766
I love them.

56:19.367 --> 56:21.309
Do you like Chinese food?

56:21.329 --> 56:22.211
I love Chinese food.

56:22.231 --> 56:22.431
All right.

56:22.491 --> 56:28.298
Chinese food is based on soy, garlic, salt,

56:29.442 --> 56:30.905
and a few other, ginger.

56:31.807 --> 56:34.432
This is organized around nutmeg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

56:35.293 --> 56:44.471
So just imagine adding nutmeg to your Thanksgiving normal English-type dinner, and you get the impression of what this is going to be.

56:44.611 --> 56:45.653
The nutmegs drop down.

56:46.876 --> 56:49.020
And around 1800,

56:49.591 --> 56:54.580
They're out of the sweeter spices and more into cayenne and spicy peppers.

56:55.382 --> 56:57.766
So there's a transition in the century.

56:57.806 --> 57:02.555
Are these calls from your own collections?

57:02.575 --> 57:04.038
Don't you know the old trick?

57:04.058 --> 57:07.464
I was talking to Sada about this.

57:07.624 --> 57:09.608
I said, we did all these exhibitions.

57:09.942 --> 57:15.728
I know why he did the exhibition, not to show the books, but to justify buying them, to put them in the exhibition.

57:15.989 --> 57:20.594
You know, it's just fun.

57:20.754 --> 57:23.817
Life offers so many interesting opportunities.

57:25.139 --> 57:32.727
Here, just to show you another aspect, if I'm interested in music things, here are a couple of other things.

57:34.158 --> 57:38.644
This is another project that I started quite by accident.

57:41.027 --> 57:44.331
It helps if you're slightly demented.

57:44.511 --> 57:58.889
Back in the 1880s, my great-grandfather was in the newspaper business in Ohio, and he worked with a guy named Frank Pixley in the mid-1880s in Akron, Ohio, P-I-X-L-E-Y.

58:00.231 --> 58:01.072
That's chapter one.

58:01.152 --> 58:03.355
Chapter two is I'm at Illinois Wesley.

58:03.588 --> 58:08.192
We have a program in music theater, school of art, and school of drama.

58:08.212 --> 58:09.914
And I'm going to a flea market.

58:10.314 --> 58:15.999
The library hasn't had, so far, too much of a collection on music theater.

58:16.880 --> 58:24.307
So I think, well, gee, how many examples of music theater can I get in piles of sheet music for real cheap?

58:25.488 --> 58:33.375
I find, when I'm there, I forget whether it was the Prince of Pilsen or King Dodo.

58:34.334 --> 58:41.523
a show from Chicago with the music by Gustav Luters and the music by Frank Pixley.

58:42.144 --> 58:50.093
And I said, this sounds like the same guy who worked with my own great-grandfather in Ohio in the 1880s and must be a relative.

58:50.354 --> 58:51.135
It's no relative.

58:51.275 --> 58:52.697
It's the same guy.

58:53.458 --> 58:55.560
He had left Ohio, come to Chicago.

58:55.580 --> 58:57.102
He was editor of a newspaper.

58:57.554 --> 59:01.458
And on the side, he used to write the words for musicals.

59:01.478 --> 59:04.822
This led me to get interested in Chicago Musical Theater.

59:05.202 --> 59:13.371
No one else, seemingly, so far as I can tell, ever made a list of musicals before 1920, launched in Chicago.

59:13.451 --> 59:17.875
But there you have, this is for you, an attempt at it.

59:18.936 --> 59:23.241
You know, again, I just started doing this because

59:23.727 --> 59:27.812
I was finding the stuff, and nobody else had it, so I thought I put it in.

59:27.832 --> 59:29.555
Obviously, you found all the stuff around here, then.

59:29.955 --> 59:37.165
Well, around here, from dealers in New England, or dealers would send me a box through the mail.

59:37.185 --> 59:38.867
Yeah, yeah.

59:40.369 --> 59:42.813
And I think there are about 120 shows.

59:42.833 --> 59:47.439
One of my colleagues in music is actually thinking of doing a book on Chicago musical theater.

59:47.499 --> 59:49.501
Now, I talked and talked and talked about it.

59:49.521 --> 59:50.323
She got interested.

59:50.343 --> 59:53.667
Babies in Toyland starts in Chicago before it goes to New York.

59:54.187 --> 59:58.593
A lot of this stuff never goes much of anywhere, but that's why I called it.

59:58.613 --> 01:00:05.262
There was a show called The Winning Miss, and that I think is a very good subset for Chicago Musical Theater.

01:00:05.282 --> 01:00:08.346
It was great out here, but it kind of missed when it got to New York.

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:15.436
Are any of these particularly scarce?

01:00:15.456 --> 01:00:17.719
Do you think any of them exist?

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:18.760
I'll tell you.

01:00:19.094 --> 01:00:22.798
That's what's so interesting, and why does Yahoo throw it out?

01:00:22.858 --> 01:00:36.150
Because I, as a sophomore working for a junior assistant librarian who just finished library school, surely knows that I am about to throw out the only excellent example of something.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.952
It's even more insidious than that.

01:00:37.972 --> 01:00:39.994
This kid's an employee.

01:00:40.014 --> 01:00:41.115
These people are employed.

01:00:41.495 --> 01:00:44.078
These are not students doing this.

01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:46.300
This is policy.
