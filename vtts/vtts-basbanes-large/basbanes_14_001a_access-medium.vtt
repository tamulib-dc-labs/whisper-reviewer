WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:29.565
two hours let's make sure it's running there it is we're talking to ken carpenter to the right and richard newman to the left so we'll just talk yeah about you know whether you know harvard and cornell are going to you know get more alike i i think that that is there's a good chance that that they will and that indeed all libraries are going to

00:29.967 --> 00:39.738
to be more alike, simply because every library has to put much more emphasis on the digital than on the printed.

00:40.399 --> 00:46.566
If you don't put more emphasis on the digital, you're not going to be serving the needs of your students and faculty.

00:46.586 --> 00:57.679
So that means that you're going to, you know, to increasingly fill the institution with people who especially value the digital, whose careers are in the digital,

00:58.098 --> 01:27.244
and and the older you know the books are are almost certainly you know not going to be as valued in that in that process except perhaps for the rare books now let me just and i'm not asking you to directly respond to this but maybe in general but i was just transcribed the cornell tapes over the weekend and i'm writing that part i was sarah thomas who's been to university library a nice woman she's when i interviewed she's just recently arrived

01:28.000 --> 01:40.667
And we were talking about, you know, they are under mandate, by the way, to bring Cornell's collections from 6.8 million on campus to 5 million by the year 2000 and never let it go above that.

01:40.687 --> 01:45.076
And that's what Los Angeles said.

01:45.858 --> 01:46.279
But that's

01:46.512 --> 01:51.739
But they're going to move some stuff out to the orchard, they say, which is a Harvard model type of a depository.

01:51.759 --> 01:52.981
It's the number on campus.

01:53.041 --> 01:57.226
They aren't being told to, you know, to get rid of.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.249
And that's important.

01:59.549 --> 02:09.442
But I was talking to Sarah, and I said, well, you know, Cornell is kind of leading the world in digitization as a means of preservation.

02:10.023 --> 02:11.305
And they're going very slowly.

02:11.365 --> 02:15.270
But she said that when she first got there, it was proposed to her

02:16.297 --> 02:43.030
by the people they have a school there of food preparation and hospitality a little one of these specialty schools they have a 15 000 volume library and it's proposed to her by that school to digitize the books that are important and get rid of the rest of them and maybe build a maybe build a computer research that she said i was charmed by the idea i was attracted she didn't accept it she was going to study it but she thought this might be a very interesting test to model

02:43.313 --> 02:46.899
as a model of a very discreet kind of a library.

02:46.919 --> 02:48.100
Hotel management.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.402
Hotel management.

02:50.123 --> 02:56.133
And I said, but if it works, they're going to, some people might say, and then she finished the sentence, yes, today hotel management, tomorrow shake.

02:57.835 --> 02:58.456
Which is true.

02:58.877 --> 03:02.623
And that's not the kind of thing you would even consider at Harvard.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.365
I mean, she has 19 libraries.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.148
You've got 90 to 100 libraries.

03:07.259 --> 03:15.851
Well, I mean, if one of your small libraries says, gee, let's try this out, I don't think that would happen at Harvard, but what do you think the attitude of something like that would be here?

03:15.871 --> 03:22.399
Is that, that's kind of not even in your, in your... It's not even within my, my, my... It's not even in the scope of... Yeah.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.961
It's not my question.

03:23.981 --> 03:24.222
Yeah.

03:25.463 --> 03:29.689
Anyway, I'm sorry to... Yeah, no, it's not within my, my, my, the, the...

03:30.091 --> 03:37.730
in the realm of my thinking, but, you know, but you should ask the question to, you know, Nancy Klein or Sid Verber, you know?

03:38.090 --> 03:39.273
Exactly.

03:39.293 --> 03:42.641
And, uh... I think I will, actually.

03:42.702 --> 03:43.503
I've got to tell you that.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.669
It's the right question.

03:45.689 --> 03:45.789
Yeah.

03:46.010 --> 03:46.210
And, uh,

03:46.510 --> 03:48.692
I need to tell you about New York Public.

03:48.712 --> 03:50.374
And I really want to go back to work.

03:50.414 --> 03:55.560
Okay, but New York Public is very important in this book, so I'm thrilled I can have the ring for you.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.925
And can you just tell me briefly for the background when you were there and what you did?

04:01.166 --> 04:13.379
I went to New York Public in around 1980, just as a favor to the administration and to fill in temporarily in the rare book room while they were reorganizing.

04:13.399 --> 04:16.062
And then I stayed ten years in a variety of

04:16.312 --> 04:21.179
of capacities, partly in rare books, partly in special collections.

04:22.060 --> 04:33.316
Then one of the most important things that Gregorian did after when he came was to establish or re-establish in an entirely new way the exhibition program.

04:33.336 --> 04:35.699
That made him, in a way.

04:36.340 --> 04:44.952
And so the problem or the issue was that, well, I'm on a number of threads now, but I'll try and put them together.

04:45.742 --> 04:51.588
Because I want to go back to his coming, because that changed the New York Public Library forever.

04:51.688 --> 04:53.911
I'm interrupting, but you didn't tell me what your capacity was.

04:53.931 --> 04:55.112
Did you have a title?

04:55.152 --> 04:56.393
No, it varied.

04:56.874 --> 04:58.996
And you went there from where, with the expertise?

04:59.637 --> 05:00.818
From publishing.

05:00.838 --> 05:04.903
I had been a publisher, an editor, and I had been an academic.

05:05.063 --> 05:05.523
In New York?

05:07.125 --> 05:12.711
Publishing in New York and Boston, an academic in Boston.

05:15.560 --> 05:24.952
Let me say a bit about Gregorian, because, as I say, that's so crucial, and that changed my job also.

05:25.333 --> 05:42.676
New York Public was a very traditional and very conventional library until his arrival, run by librarians, run by a ward that was largely people who were book-oriented as opposed to corporate types.

05:42.696 --> 05:44.318
And New York Public had a lot of money.

05:45.209 --> 06:05.273
money that it was able to live on from the consolidation of the libraries 100 years ago, but which beginning, you know, 20, 30 years ago, began not to be able to buy what it had been able to buy in the past.

06:05.353 --> 06:07.495
And there had never been a capital campaign.

06:08.156 --> 06:13.022
I assume you know the history in terms of the Astor Library and the

06:13.525 --> 06:18.710
the Lennox Library, and the Tilden Trust, which is where the money came from.

06:19.190 --> 06:30.101
A remarkable story by itself of how those institutions came together with the city of New York to create a public entity out of public, a public entity out of private.

06:30.121 --> 06:33.864
And continues actually in a very bizarre, totally bizarre way.

06:34.225 --> 06:37.528
It's a self-perpetuating board of trustees.

06:37.548 --> 06:42.132
But the library had begun to decline financially.

06:42.972 --> 06:46.357
and therefore in influence.

06:46.377 --> 06:52.545
And Gregorian was something of an unusual choice, I think, as a librarian.

06:52.605 --> 06:57.251
How that, as director, and how that happened, I don't know.

06:57.271 --> 06:59.694
That's a political story, which I don't know.

07:00.796 --> 07:12.051
But he began immediately to try to transform the institution from

07:13.162 --> 07:17.306
I don't want to say it was sleepy, but it was very traditional.

07:19.348 --> 07:39.688
His first emphasis was on raising money, and his way to do that was to make the library news, which it never had been before, and a center of attention, which it had not been.

07:40.409 --> 07:42.831
And that turned out to be very easy to do.

07:43.317 --> 07:46.562
I don't want to detract from him.

07:47.543 --> 07:50.488
Perhaps only he could have thought of doing it.

07:50.508 --> 07:55.876
But once someone thought of doing it, as we said, as we used to say, who hates the library?

07:55.996 --> 07:57.178
Nobody.

07:57.258 --> 08:01.124
I mean, the New York City is full of friends of the library who'd never been asked to do anything.

08:02.206 --> 08:08.976
So before his coming there had been a very significant needs assessment.

08:08.996 --> 08:10.438
I'm just checking what I'm doing tonight.

08:10.739 --> 08:13.082
You know, administrators do that sort of thing.

08:13.142 --> 08:14.624
Where do you want to be in ten years?

08:14.804 --> 08:17.787
But nobody had ever taken one of those seriously before.

08:18.708 --> 08:35.688
Until under, under, just before the drawing came, it was clear that what the library needed was about a billion dollars.

08:35.708 --> 08:36.569
Okay.

08:36.589 --> 08:40.594
And so they went to the fundraising people who said, you know, it can't be done.

08:41.435 --> 08:46.883
You know, everybody said, what I need is, what I want is, and they added it off, and it's a billion dollars.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.667
The fundraiser said, it cannot be done.

08:49.687 --> 08:53.112
But what you can do is, what you can aim for is a third of that.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.217
A third of the program.

08:56.237 --> 08:57.018
That's realistic.

08:57.038 --> 09:00.203
So everything was cut back expectations.

09:00.223 --> 09:09.096
Gregorian came to institute, to institute that, that program, and which he,

09:10.477 --> 09:12.100
I'll try to make it short and simple.

09:12.200 --> 09:18.010
He turned the institution into something other than what it had been.

09:18.030 --> 09:21.717
It became very corporate.

09:21.737 --> 09:26.045
That is, he called himself the CEO.

09:27.427 --> 09:33.598
He expanded enormously an office of public relations.

09:33.798 --> 09:38.162
It used to be one woman who occasionally called up somebody.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.784
Now there's a vast office of professionals.

09:41.525 --> 09:52.735
But most important was a vast and very expensive office of fundraising.

09:52.815 --> 09:53.876
Is this bad by the way?

09:53.896 --> 09:54.476
I'm curious.

09:54.597 --> 09:55.838
It's good and bad.

09:55.978 --> 09:57.239
It's interesting.

09:57.259 --> 09:58.040
It's good and bad.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.001
It's good because he raised the money.

10:00.021 --> 10:01.763
He raised a third of a billion dollars.

10:03.008 --> 10:08.596
It's bad because none of that, not a cent of that, went for books or Stan.

10:10.399 --> 10:17.610
You can ask, what are the great acquisitions of the New York Public Library under Vartan Gregorian and his third of a billion dollars?

10:17.670 --> 10:21.236
And the answer is none.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.200
It went into the building.

10:26.263 --> 10:30.630
Floodlights, everything was redone, old, everything was polished.

10:30.790 --> 10:32.172
So everybody would walk by and say,

10:32.557 --> 10:35.540
Gee, the New York Public Library is really different.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.541
Well, it is and it isn't.

10:36.902 --> 10:44.209
It was a Potemkin village in a way, and it raised consciousness about the library.

10:45.030 --> 10:51.477
It made the library a fashionable place to be for New York society to be involved with.

10:52.137 --> 10:59.425
So there were, it became socially acceptable, no, socially desirable,

10:59.928 --> 11:08.438
to be on the board or associated, like the Met or the Opera or something, which it hadn't been before.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.821
It had been sort of book people.

11:12.403 --> 11:19.811
Then, you can't use this as a direct quote, but in fact they sold seats on the board.

11:19.831 --> 11:23.155
And the board changed from book people to corporate.

11:23.175 --> 11:23.796
I could ask them.

11:24.176 --> 11:26.779
I mean, certainly I used it as a quote, but I could pursue it.

11:26.859 --> 11:29.142
Well, I saw the

11:30.016 --> 11:35.884
I saw the letters that went to new members of the board.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.848
Vice President of the X Corporation, welcome to the board.

11:39.409 --> 11:47.901
We look forward to your contribution of $100,000, $250,000, $500,000.

11:48.262 --> 11:57.154
Gregorian, he was an academic, so he insisted on holding one of those seats.

11:59.227 --> 12:02.552
for Tony Morrison.

12:03.293 --> 12:13.908
But with the others, it turned it into a corporate, into corporate management, his style, and now a board, you know, behind him.

12:17.092 --> 12:19.075
So the atmosphere was entirely different.

12:19.095 --> 12:20.977
It was no longer bookish.

12:21.578 --> 12:27.867
It was no longer bookmen, book people were no longer, you know, the power shifted

12:28.302 --> 12:33.637
over to this new breed of professional managers.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.902
A lot of people came from the zoo, which became a library in-joke.

12:43.135 --> 12:51.105
That is a class of professional managers who won't move from one non-profit institution to the other and couldn't tell the difference between the library and the zoo.

12:51.326 --> 12:52.647
And it didn't matter to them.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.790
I'm so glad you didn't say monkeys in the zoo.

12:54.810 --> 12:59.677
I got monkeys out in some room.

12:59.697 --> 13:05.264
Well, I remember sitting at a meeting of maybe 25 people.

13:05.364 --> 13:09.970
This was the new managerial class that had taken over.

13:10.473 --> 13:12.516
It took a couple of years to happen.

13:12.616 --> 13:14.018
What positions are we talking about?

13:14.098 --> 13:18.685
Well, the director of—the vice president for fundraising, public relations.

13:18.785 --> 13:22.711
That's really who—these were Gregorian's own staff.

13:22.731 --> 13:33.026
These were people who, you know, sort of— How did it impact the actual—the ability to come in and find knowledge, shall we say?

13:33.166 --> 13:33.767
Say again?

13:33.868 --> 13:39.636
The ability for a scholar, a reader— It didn't change that, because the librarians remain the same.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.070
That's an important point to make, then.

13:42.090 --> 13:51.546
Oh, it's a crucial point to make, because in terms of public service, which is what— See, New York Public is different from all other libraries in that.

13:51.566 --> 14:00.460
It has the size and quality of either a national library or a great university library that's public.

14:01.064 --> 14:02.506
Anybody can go in there and do anything.

14:02.526 --> 14:04.128
You don't have to have a library card.

14:04.188 --> 14:05.210
You don't have to do anything.

14:05.370 --> 14:06.772
It is astonishing.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.354
I tried to get a library card.

14:08.374 --> 14:09.456
There's no such thing.

14:09.556 --> 14:10.678
There's no such thing.

14:10.738 --> 14:11.459
That's right.

14:11.479 --> 14:13.321
This is the people's university.

14:13.341 --> 14:15.905
This is free, you know, to anybody.

14:16.306 --> 14:24.557
And that, you know, there's a problem of uniting democratic access to elitist collections.

14:24.577 --> 14:29.164
There's an inherent contradiction, and it doesn't always work, but it is one of the great ideas

14:30.022 --> 14:31.624
And it is one of the great principles.

14:31.865 --> 14:35.790
And for 100 years, for all practical purposes, it has worked.

14:35.810 --> 14:39.255
So the guy coming in, and everybody's treated the same.

14:39.275 --> 14:47.507
The crazy person who comes in to copy the dictionary in his notebooks or the serious researcher, they're all treated the same.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.690
The library staff is very good.

14:50.551 --> 14:57.261
Their morale began to go down because they saw that the library had been taken away from them.

14:57.832 --> 15:01.675
You know, but I interviewed Martin last year.

15:03.157 --> 15:03.917
Now, it's interesting.

15:04.118 --> 15:06.099
His story might be different.

15:06.119 --> 15:17.430
When he arrived, he said there were suggestions that they sell an Audubon folio, they start parsing off things to raise money.

15:17.970 --> 15:20.332
No, nothing was ever sold.

15:20.392 --> 15:22.774
But he said there were suggestions.

15:22.795 --> 15:25.577
Well, that might very well be.

15:26.097 --> 15:29.141
There were other alternatives here that he was faced with.

15:29.161 --> 15:36.311
I don't fall into what he did in terms of... And he said that was totally not part of his agenda, so I mean... Oh, that's true.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.155
Well, I don't dispute that at all.

15:39.175 --> 15:50.691
But I'm just saying it changed from... I don't want to say it changed from the library, because if you're a reader and you go in off the street, it's just that nothing is different.

15:50.711 --> 15:52.414
But inside, it's totally different.

15:52.434 --> 15:53.455
The mentality is different.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.115
You mean at the administrative level?

15:56.175 --> 15:57.417
Oh, yes, absolutely.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.820
And that's the town.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.202
And they've continued this with Paul.

16:01.242 --> 16:02.944
Paul's not a librarian.

16:03.004 --> 16:09.412
Well, he's more of a scholar and academic than Gregorian was.

16:09.432 --> 16:10.834
But you're seeing this now, aren't you?

16:11.034 --> 16:14.278
That libraries are picking non-librarians.

16:14.393 --> 16:15.034
Sure.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.597
Dr. Billington of the Library of Congress.

16:18.617 --> 16:37.576
I remember sitting in a, I started to say, a meeting of the people who are now running the library, and something came up about the library's Bible collection, which is one of the greatest in the West, the first Gutenberg to come to America.

16:38.737 --> 16:43.962
We used to call Mr. Minnix, as if he was still with us.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.027
All these people started laughing.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.791
They said, why does the library collect Bibles?

16:49.971 --> 16:55.897
The whole table of 25 people who are running the library.

16:55.917 --> 17:02.464
They had no concept of print, of the history of printing, of book collecting.

17:03.205 --> 17:09.691
The idea to collect Bibles was just so alien to them.

17:10.672 --> 17:13.375
It's like saying, why do we have a collection of

17:13.827 --> 17:14.749
ice cream cones.

17:14.769 --> 17:19.537
I mean, it's totally out of their capacity to comprehend.

17:21.360 --> 17:32.378
So what I'm suggesting is there's an incredibly significant shift in the orientation on the part of management.

17:32.398 --> 17:40.071
You can't say administration anymore because these are managers who go from the zoo to the library and can't tell the difference.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.684
How do you define the difference between the ministers?

17:42.704 --> 17:43.284
Well, I don't know.

17:43.344 --> 17:52.317
I'm just trying to say these are professionals who are not book people who think they can manage anything and, in fact, can't manage anything very well unknown.

17:53.118 --> 18:09.602
So one of the things that Gregorian set out to do, to draw attention to the library as a precondition for fundraising, was to establish an extraordinarily successful

18:09.953 --> 18:15.959
exhibition program, a glorious room that had been turned into tacky offices.

18:17.621 --> 18:27.131
The plywood was torn down, and underneath was one of the most glorious rooms in New York, now called the Gottesman exhibition.

18:29.293 --> 18:37.902
And he had that redone, the Gottesman family, whose money comes from paper.

18:38.185 --> 19:04.851
paid for that and he hired an extraordinary the a couple of people were behind him behind who gregorian he was not there alone this is an aside but it's when it comes back the circle comes back the most important person behind him was andrew high school who was chairman of the board and andrew high school had the style the connections and the commitment

19:06.451 --> 19:10.557
First of all, he was married to the New York Times at the time.

19:10.577 --> 19:11.718
How do we spell high school?

19:11.738 --> 19:13.521
H-E-I-S-K-E-L-L.

19:13.701 --> 19:20.911
He had run Time, Life, and Fortune, and his wife was the New York Times.

19:21.071 --> 19:24.696
This is what LexisNexis is perfect for, how you can do a search on this diary.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.839
Well, he knew everybody.

19:26.859 --> 19:33.268
He's the sort of person who, you could say,

19:35.459 --> 19:47.010
Andrew, we want to borrow a book from the Lennon State Library, and we've written and written, and they don't respond.

19:47.110 --> 19:59.302
Would you call up the Secretary of State and have him call the criminal?

19:59.322 --> 20:02.125
And he would go right to the phone and say, what's the book you want?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.249
I mean, that happened.

20:05.630 --> 20:10.975
I was there when that happened, that illustration of this.

20:10.995 --> 20:22.848
And so behind the scenes of Gregorian was this sophisticated, elegant, literate person, Andrew High School.

20:22.908 --> 20:32.619
Gregorian also had a very effective vice president for development whose name eludes me.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.900
He now runs the

20:35.450 --> 20:46.267
He was very good.

20:46.548 --> 20:54.721
And then he also hired a woman named Diantha Shule to do exhibitions, and she was brilliant.

20:54.741 --> 21:02.453
And so an exhibition was no longer, you know, some books in a case that

21:02.855 --> 21:04.818
that ten people came to see.

21:04.938 --> 21:18.638
It became a glittering New York society opening, and that exhibition staff was quite brilliant.

21:18.879 --> 21:21.903
I just did a piece on the Romanov thing for this probiglial.

21:21.923 --> 21:23.966
I mean, it's a first-rate exhibition.

21:24.187 --> 21:32.659
Well, look at the New York Public Library exhibitions from the mid-'80s, and they cost, unfortunately,

21:32.960 --> 21:37.404
That's part of the Gregorian's fundraising, went into fundraising.

21:38.565 --> 21:50.236
But it changed the exhibitions, turned the library into a public space, you know, in a public social space, in a way that it hadn't been before.

21:50.276 --> 21:54.901
And so then the library was for rent.

21:56.142 --> 22:00.486
Corporate people had— You have no idea how much this parallels what's going on out in San Francisco.

22:00.685 --> 22:03.688
They actually built this library, and you go in and say, where are the books?

22:03.748 --> 22:06.511
They built this thing to have social functions.

22:06.851 --> 22:09.894
And they really went out and courted corporate sponsors.

22:09.934 --> 22:11.675
They named these affinity rooms.

22:11.776 --> 22:15.399
There's the Hormel, you know, whatever it is.

22:15.419 --> 22:17.981
The gay lesbian collection is the Hormel collection.

22:18.042 --> 22:22.346
So far as I know, it was Gregorian, the libraries, who started that.

22:22.366 --> 22:24.388
And he got it from the MEP.

22:24.408 --> 22:29.072
Our model was the MEP, because wherever you turn in the MEP, there's the cash register.

22:29.795 --> 22:32.898
And so there was a gift shop.

22:33.179 --> 22:54.081
This is about the mid-'80s, and my job was really sort of liaison between this new administration, which was hot, exciting, dramatic, money-raising, corporate, fashionable, and the librarians who knew the material, who were

22:54.601 --> 22:56.763
public service oriented.

22:56.823 --> 23:00.307
These couldn't have been two more different communities of people.

23:00.327 --> 23:13.500
And so I went to work in exhibitions, working with the library staff to think of projects for exhibitions, helping select objects to put on display.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.683
Were you kind of like an intermediary between the two camps?

23:16.703 --> 23:17.744
Yes, it was exactly what it was.

23:18.004 --> 23:23.089
Trying to explain to the librarians that Gregorian

23:23.322 --> 23:24.503
that this was necessary.

23:24.743 --> 23:26.165
And did you believe it was necessary?

23:27.486 --> 23:27.787
Yes.

23:27.967 --> 23:34.293
I became more disillusioned as I went along when I saw that it was more shallow than I had thought.

23:34.674 --> 23:50.190
But I often quoted Gregorian, and I still will and could, in agreement, if you don't like having corporate parties here, you tell me another way to raise that much money in one night.

23:52.027 --> 23:55.532
Now, the answer is there is no other way to raise that much money in one night.

23:55.612 --> 24:16.341
And so, you know, if you're a librarian making $20,000 a year and on your way out at 6 o'clock you see the limousines come up and the strawberries dipped in chocolate flown in from Paris, you say, what's happened to my librarian?

24:16.401 --> 24:19.806
So my job really was to talk to people

24:20.073 --> 24:28.185
to both groups and say to the administrative staff, you know, this is not a corporate headquarters.

24:28.265 --> 24:31.349
These librarians think differently, act differently.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.751
They're like academics.

24:32.832 --> 24:34.774
They have different values and so forth.

24:35.175 --> 24:43.207
So it was a conflict that was never really resolved.

24:43.227 --> 24:48.274
And Gregorian, who was enormously popular among New Yorkers,

24:48.794 --> 24:51.698
was not popular at all among the staff.

24:51.718 --> 24:55.765
So were you there when he left for Brown, or had you already left, that you were still there?

24:55.785 --> 24:56.205
Yes.

24:56.225 --> 24:58.489
And so you were there from 80 to 90, is that what you said?

24:58.509 --> 25:01.053
Yes, I saw him come, I saw him go.

25:01.333 --> 25:05.019
And then his successor was the Jesuit, I think, is that right?

25:05.099 --> 25:09.366
Yes, Timothy Healy, a very odd choice.

25:09.666 --> 25:16.236
But he got that job because he was president of Georgetown,

25:17.482 --> 25:21.287
Somebody handed me a printed page.

25:22.288 --> 25:29.117
It was a law passed by the Congress of the United States and said to me, what does this mean?

25:29.137 --> 25:34.263
So I started reading it, and by the first sentence, I had no idea what it meant.

25:34.323 --> 25:35.325
I read the whole page.

25:35.885 --> 25:36.726
It didn't mean anything.

25:37.047 --> 25:39.990
It was the most technical, confused.

25:40.591 --> 25:45.177
I mean, I had no sense of any kind of what this might be about.

25:45.528 --> 25:46.450
So I gave it back.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.693
I said, I don't know what it is.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.476
And the person said, I'll tell you what it is.

25:50.556 --> 25:57.988
It's the law passed by the Congress of the United States that uses federal money to pave all the streets at Georgetown University.

26:01.855 --> 26:04.239
It didn't even say that.

26:04.379 --> 26:04.760
But it did.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.042
That's why.

26:06.062 --> 26:06.863
But that was the result.

26:07.724 --> 26:08.926
That's why Father Healy came.

26:09.708 --> 26:10.489
Because.

26:10.958 --> 26:17.447
The notion was Gregorian had pulled all the private money out of New York that he could.

26:18.769 --> 26:26.780
That there was no use going, there was the thought of going national, starting a national magazine and so forth.

26:26.800 --> 26:34.291
But then it was clear that New York Public Library is finally not a national institution.

26:34.311 --> 26:37.135
It's not L.C., it's not Harvard, it's not.

26:37.739 --> 26:41.403
They've been doing things with Doubleday, for instance.

26:41.423 --> 26:42.664
Have you noticed the books?

26:43.064 --> 26:43.965
That was my idea.

26:43.985 --> 26:44.826
Which I kind of like.

26:44.906 --> 26:46.668
Is that right?

26:46.688 --> 26:47.349
That was your idea?

26:47.409 --> 26:47.869
Certainly was.

26:48.009 --> 26:48.650
I think it's British.

26:48.670 --> 26:52.454
I went to the lunch with a lunch then, actually.

26:52.474 --> 26:58.280
Anyway, the notion was, Gregorian got all the drained.

27:00.002 --> 27:00.582
Not drained.

27:00.602 --> 27:02.504
So maybe he felt it was time to move on.

27:02.524 --> 27:05.027
Oh, he chose to leave because the 80s were over.

27:05.227 --> 27:06.328
He had done what he had

27:06.697 --> 27:07.759
what he was going to do.

27:08.079 --> 27:11.985
And he, I mean, he's not, he's very shrewd.

27:12.005 --> 27:19.857
And so that was entirely voluntary because he did what he could do and was smart enough to say, it's time for me to go.

27:20.979 --> 27:28.811
But healing, a Jesuit, running a public institution, it was a very strange or even bizarre choice.

27:28.831 --> 27:30.554
But I just told you why.

27:30.574 --> 27:34.259
Because the feeling was, we can't go national.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.421
We've taken New York.

27:36.228 --> 27:37.790
We've gotten all we're going to get here.

27:38.572 --> 27:39.413
And so where?

27:39.854 --> 27:40.294
Look around.

27:40.334 --> 27:41.416
Who has money?

27:41.436 --> 27:42.017
Federal government.

27:42.037 --> 27:42.838
Was he successful?

27:43.359 --> 27:44.741
I don't know.

27:44.781 --> 27:46.424
He was not successful as a person.

27:47.606 --> 27:53.755
He was just very bright, but reclusive.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.940
Just the opposite of Gregorian.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.666
Gregorian would aim head for the camera.

28:00.947 --> 28:03.671
And he only would lock himself in his office.

28:03.691 --> 28:04.412
So what do you think?

28:05.202 --> 28:09.928
The thinking was then from Gregorian to Healy to Leclerc.

28:10.088 --> 28:23.646
I mean... I was gone by that time, and so I don't want to say... But it seems to be a continuation... Leclerc seems to be closer to... It's more academic, because Healy claimed to be an academic.

28:24.047 --> 28:24.848
But he's raising money.

28:24.868 --> 28:28.753
He told me, he said, I have to raise $600,000 a week to keep this thing going.

28:28.773 --> 28:29.354
Who says that?

28:29.394 --> 28:30.175
Paul said this thing.

28:30.195 --> 28:30.515
Leclerc.

28:30.575 --> 28:31.917
Oh, sure.

28:31.937 --> 28:32.858
Gregorian... That's the number.

28:32.878 --> 28:33.980
That's the working number.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.821
$600,000 a week.

28:35.071 --> 28:41.339
Gregorian used to say, I go to lunch only for a million dollars.

28:41.359 --> 28:42.200
That's a great quote.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.103
It is.

28:44.203 --> 28:45.444
And we called it lunch money.

28:45.945 --> 28:46.225
Wow.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.228
And my office was next.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.172
Finally, I became manager of publications.

28:52.674 --> 29:04.369
My office was next to the office of the person who physically handled the checks, entered them in the computer, and sent them to wherever they were supposed to go.

29:04.923 --> 29:09.008
And Gregorian said, I don't have lunch for less than a million dollars.

29:09.028 --> 29:09.349
That's amazing.

29:09.889 --> 29:15.857
And every day Gregorian would go to lunch, and my friend next door would wait.

29:15.877 --> 29:22.966
And about 2.30 or 3, somebody would come over from the president's office with the lunch one.

29:23.266 --> 29:25.169
We called it lunch one.

29:25.189 --> 29:32.718
And if it didn't, you know, it's 3 o'clock, there's no, I mean, you know, you get to depend on it.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.120
He would call up and say,

29:34.927 --> 29:36.749
VG didn't have lunch today.

29:39.473 --> 29:46.121
You know, when I interviewed him in March last evening, of course, his new appointment had already been announced at the Carnegie Square.

29:46.141 --> 29:54.732
He's very pleased to note that there have only been two foreign-born heads of the Carnegie Corporation, Andrew Carnegie himself.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.454
And I said, you know, well, that's very interesting.

29:56.514 --> 29:58.676
Andrew Carnegie built 1,600 libraries.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.059
What are your plans for libraries?

30:01.119 --> 30:03.162
He said, I have to go assess the situation.

30:03.530 --> 30:06.194
He wouldn't say one way or the other if he plans to do anything.

30:06.274 --> 30:07.115
He's very creative.

30:07.636 --> 30:08.637
He's very powerful.

30:08.697 --> 30:09.598
He's very creative.

30:09.678 --> 30:16.448
He did something that any sane person would say couldn't be done.

30:16.468 --> 30:17.950
He took New York.

30:18.411 --> 30:20.073
He took it.

30:20.093 --> 30:20.614
He took it.

30:21.415 --> 30:24.639
He would do three parties a night.

30:24.659 --> 30:27.463
Cocktails, dinner, and parties.

30:27.643 --> 30:31.629
Three places, which he called, you know, dancing.

30:31.649 --> 30:32.490
He would go.

30:32.588 --> 30:42.889
And he would do three, you know, you do three a night, six days, that's 18 parties a week, and you meet a hell of a lot of people.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.474
Look what he did at Brown, $300 million to $850 million at night.

30:45.574 --> 30:48.620
He is an extraordinary, you know.

30:48.640 --> 30:52.909
People, it got to be, he made the library fashionable.

30:53.885 --> 31:00.672
And it got to be—I mean, people would be insulted if he didn't ask them for money.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.934
People would come and say, you know, what's wrong with me?

31:02.954 --> 31:06.137
My money isn't good enough for you.

31:06.157 --> 31:13.204
And so, you know, he's the most extraordinary fundraiser I ever saw.

31:13.244 --> 31:15.106
And he did it in a variety of ways.

31:16.247 --> 31:22.373
First of all, he's—unlike people of the social class

31:22.606 --> 31:24.590
who tend to have money.

31:24.610 --> 31:25.712
Gregorian is very physical.

31:26.654 --> 31:28.417
He was touching.

31:28.437 --> 31:31.282
He'd come in, hug you, put his arm around you, touch you.

31:32.084 --> 31:37.474
These are people who don't ever get touched by their own family.

31:37.494 --> 31:42.182
And so that, there's a warmth about him, too.

31:42.202 --> 31:45.829
And in New York, he passed for an intellectual.

31:46.720 --> 32:10.652
passport are you suggesting no i didn't i'm just curious i didn't uh in the social circles in which he moved and remember this is new york which is very sophisticated but it's not boston or it's not even thought out there and gregory innocent there's no academics in that circle maybe arthur spessinger

32:11.257 --> 32:18.828
Gregorian, you know, would be at a dinner party and he would say something about the Congress of Vienna.

32:18.848 --> 32:19.589
Drop dead.

32:19.609 --> 32:22.193
It was a knockout.

32:22.554 --> 32:25.258
People thought, this guy, this guy is brilliant.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.002
You'd say, you know, blah, blah, blah.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.384
Then capitalism entered.

32:30.806 --> 32:34.912
What I call the sophomore course is, you know, the World History Survey.

32:35.673 --> 32:38.057
And among people in

32:38.577 --> 32:39.978
the fashion industry.

32:41.119 --> 32:46.204
This was the most brilliant small talk they had ever heard at parties.

32:46.244 --> 32:47.345
He turned the hell out of me.

32:48.005 --> 32:51.969
Well, I was talking about some of the things, like you asked me, what are you doing, and I was talking about the immigrant.

32:51.989 --> 32:54.511
He said, well, when you're in Paris, you've got to go to the Polish library.

32:55.031 --> 33:01.597
He said, when there was no Poland, they built this, they established this library in Paris, and that was the national... I didn't know that.

33:01.957 --> 33:03.439
And I went there.

33:03.559 --> 33:04.199
He is a charm.

33:04.219 --> 33:08.483
And bang, we're talking about, you know, Soviets' book culture.

33:08.783 --> 33:20.024
And he said, you know, when Beria fell out of power, fell out of favor, they sent out the word that you slice out Beria out of the encyclopedia and put in Bering Sea.

33:22.127 --> 33:24.171
So I asked Edward Kasnack about this.

33:24.191 --> 33:24.933
He says, absolutely.

33:24.953 --> 33:25.834
And we kept the original.

33:25.854 --> 33:26.556
I'll show it to you.

33:27.317 --> 33:30.623
You see, with a computer, it was very interesting because today with a computer,

33:30.772 --> 33:32.154
you'd just go in and take it out.

33:32.895 --> 33:35.540
And there'd be no physical record of the change.

33:36.321 --> 33:37.323
So it is irrelevant.

33:37.403 --> 33:38.905
He's put in trash garbage.

33:38.925 --> 33:39.446
Were you there?

33:40.207 --> 33:45.536
You must have seen, of course, the New Yorker piece on the deaccessions and the Zinman.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.539
That was after my point.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.102
But that's all true.

33:49.362 --> 33:53.449
All through the 80s, very rare material was just thrown out.

33:54.250 --> 33:55.412
That's not Gregorian's doing it.

33:55.612 --> 33:56.273
No, I don't think so.

33:56.313 --> 34:00.439
I talked to David Stamm, who was up at Syracuse, and he said, I've got to tell you, that was me.

34:00.859 --> 34:06.027
And this was at a breakfast with Bill Joyce just a couple weeks ago.

34:06.087 --> 34:10.553
And they said, you know, we were doing 40,000 items a year.

34:10.573 --> 34:16.101
It was funded by any age or whatever, and this was preservation money.

34:16.705 --> 34:20.572
So they were actually preserving things by destroying them.

34:20.753 --> 34:21.454
Like Vietnam.

34:21.474 --> 34:22.917
So I don't know.

34:23.197 --> 34:29.770
And did the library of Congress do that with its American literature or American history?

34:30.071 --> 34:31.594
They certainly did it with all their newspapers.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.736
I don't know if they did it with their history.

34:32.976 --> 34:36.503
I think they did it with their American history or literature.

34:36.483 --> 34:42.009
It happens to the people who get in there first, doesn't it, in some ways?

34:42.129 --> 34:47.315
When I protested this in the eighties, I was told— You protested what?

34:47.395 --> 34:47.755
I'm sorry.

34:47.815 --> 34:48.977
Throwing the stuff away.

34:48.997 --> 34:52.160
So you did— Oh, I was shocked.

34:52.240 --> 34:59.488
First I was told that it wasn't happening, that everything was checked against the National Union catalog.

34:59.508 --> 35:02.271
There were three or fewer non-copies that were saved.

35:02.588 --> 35:03.970
Then I found out that was a lie.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.071
So you saw this happening?

35:05.251 --> 35:08.335
Oh, yes, wonderful pamphlets.

35:09.536 --> 35:14.222
But nobody was telling you, David didn't know, for instance, I said, you know, the New Yorker didn't name the dealer.

35:15.824 --> 35:19.568
And I thought it might have been Billy Reese who they were protecting, but it wasn't Bill Reese.

35:21.511 --> 35:23.533
They said, you know, we don't, I can't remember.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.336
I don't know who the dealer was.

35:26.857 --> 35:27.898
Were they giving it to him?

35:27.938 --> 35:28.679
Were they selling it?

35:29.820 --> 35:39.650
I think what it comes down to is the guy was coming to get it at scrap value, and Zinman sold one pamphlet, I don't think it was in the New Yorker piece, for $56,000.

35:39.890 --> 35:41.292
That's right.

35:41.312 --> 35:53.284
This is because the people who were responsible for that, Paul Fasana, Richard DeGennaro, F-A-S-A-N-A, these are bureaucrats.

35:54.125 --> 35:57.569
But they're bureaucrats and technicians, technocrats.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.472
Well, were these people that came in, do you think, as part of that earlier group?

36:00.492 --> 36:04.616
No, they were all—Fasano was a carryover.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.158
He was there pre-Gregorian.

36:06.378 --> 36:07.459
So he's a librarian?

36:07.659 --> 36:08.380
He's a librarian.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.003
But his field is technology.

36:11.363 --> 36:12.965
He is the person— Is he still there?

36:12.985 --> 36:13.745
No.

36:13.765 --> 36:14.807
He is retired.

36:15.027 --> 36:20.993
He is the person who put New York Public Library catalog on lawn.

36:21.327 --> 36:27.178
He is the person I complained to, and he told me, as I said, it's not true.

36:27.238 --> 36:28.401
Things are checked.

36:28.421 --> 36:30.084
Then I found out that wasn't true.

36:30.464 --> 36:35.514
They were throwing away stuff, which New York Valley had the only known copy.

36:35.534 --> 36:38.420
It had been preserved, because they had filmed it.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.766
And so I protested much more strongly on this to all of them.

36:42.151 --> 36:47.216
The library is interested in—the library calls information, not options.

36:47.276 --> 36:48.577
How do you define preservation?

36:48.737 --> 36:51.380
I'm going to ask Ken to comment on it, too.

36:51.400 --> 36:54.023
Well, that's not my field.

36:54.043 --> 36:56.305
Let's ask Ken, how do you define preservation?

36:57.186 --> 37:02.811
Well, as a matter of fact, you know, the object also has information, doesn't it?

37:02.831 --> 37:03.031
Of course.

37:03.051 --> 37:05.013
But the technocrat doesn't even know that.

37:05.294 --> 37:05.494
No.

37:06.094 --> 37:09.778
But, you know, there were pamphlets that I had seen

37:10.265 --> 37:13.829
But at the time, I'd seen them say I didn't have a ruler with me.

37:13.969 --> 37:15.090
Are we talking NYPL?

37:15.611 --> 37:17.052
Yeah, an NYPL.

37:17.092 --> 37:20.776
So my description was not complete for a bibliographical project.

37:20.796 --> 37:22.478
So you had gone there as a scholar?

37:22.498 --> 37:23.479
Yes.

37:23.499 --> 37:32.369
I'd gone as a scholar because I was working on a bibliography of translations of economic literature.

37:32.389 --> 37:33.850
And this is when you were at Crest?

37:34.611 --> 37:36.914
Well, I've continued to work on it, actually.

37:37.654 --> 37:40.137
And so I'd seen these pamphlets.

37:40.353 --> 37:48.087
And then I went back in order to see them again and check my notes and measure them, and I couldn't do that.

37:48.427 --> 37:51.313
So there was information that was gone.

37:51.814 --> 37:55.440
Maybe I was looking to check the signature collation.

37:55.640 --> 37:56.221
I don't know.

37:56.241 --> 37:59.668
That could have been another reason I wanted to see it again.

37:59.728 --> 38:03.795
Maybe I had some reason to doubt the accuracy of what I'd done.

38:04.180 --> 38:11.130
But the information that that physical object contained was no longer accessible to me anyway.

38:11.170 --> 38:13.894
And that's very significant information, you would say.

38:14.134 --> 38:17.739
And this guy kind of goes back to this paratextual discussion we had.

38:17.759 --> 38:22.786
Yeah, I mean, I think it's significant.

38:22.886 --> 38:32.500
It's also true that the difference between information and the object is, in a way, it's hard to describe.

38:33.222 --> 38:39.329
in the sense that one can say, yes, the library's job is to collect and preserve information.

38:39.409 --> 38:46.478
And I can read a pamphlet on microfilm, and I, you know, same pamphlet, I get the same information.

38:47.339 --> 38:58.572
But there is something emotionally different when you hold it in your hand, when it's an object.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.572
See, that's what Stephen Jay Gould says.

39:00.792 --> 39:01.133
It's true.

39:01.253 --> 39:03.556
That's why he's in this particular chapter.

39:03.576 --> 39:08.182
It's true, and particularly if this— He says he can't write from facsimiles, for instance.

39:08.842 --> 39:21.218
It's the difference between reality and copies or imitations or pictures of, you know, but there's a thing and there's a picture of a thing.

39:21.603 --> 39:25.795
You see, they would film the text of that.

39:26.417 --> 39:30.128
You've just showed me a book called A Souvenir of the Anchor Line Agents.

39:30.580 --> 39:34.585
Excursion on the steamer, California, August 14, 1870.

39:34.985 --> 39:37.508
Gorgeous gold pictorial cloth.

39:37.528 --> 39:41.873
This is, what would you say, the size is kind of a... Oversight.

39:42.093 --> 39:44.296
Well, it certainly is quarto.

39:44.957 --> 39:46.138
Well, I would say it's folio.

39:46.298 --> 39:48.221
I would say it's kind of folio, too.

39:48.361 --> 39:50.543
But this would disappear, is what you're telling me.

39:51.124 --> 39:52.606
Yeah, that would be gone.

39:52.726 --> 39:53.427
That would be gone.

39:53.967 --> 39:56.530
All you would have would be a microfilm of that text.

39:56.550 --> 39:57.111
We'd have a picture of it.

39:57.648 --> 40:05.770
You would not know from that that this is truly a souvenir, you know, a grand book that they were giving away.

40:05.790 --> 40:09.820
There's a difference between having a drink and having a picture of a drink.

40:12.768 --> 40:12.929
Wow.

40:12.949 --> 40:14.172
Is this something you rescued?

40:14.624 --> 40:31.117
I ran across it in the stacks, and I'm going to turn it over to the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts in the Houghton Library, because I sometimes pull out interesting bindings for them as I go through things.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.283
They'll want it.

40:34.844 --> 40:36.868
You know, when I was at Cornell, you see,

40:37.203 --> 40:39.987
embarked in a very modest program.

40:40.007 --> 40:44.573
And when I was there in October of 96, they had already done 5,500 books.

40:44.974 --> 40:45.134
Done.

40:45.775 --> 40:46.376
Digitized.

40:46.776 --> 40:50.722
And then I went up to the room where they do this, and I'll describe it.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.364
Damn it, I had my camera with me.

40:52.424 --> 40:53.766
I might go back just to take pictures.

40:55.528 --> 40:57.591
Sixth floor overlooking this gorgeous lake.

40:58.043 --> 41:00.066
And there are these books guillotined.

41:00.086 --> 41:01.107
They look like real cutlets.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.310
They look like they had been stripped and dressed.

41:03.330 --> 41:03.871
They have been.

41:04.291 --> 41:06.054
And they were there.

41:06.354 --> 41:06.895
Slaughtered.

41:06.915 --> 41:13.925
And then when they're done, and the quality control person, they're called digital archivists, by the way, the people who do this.

41:14.545 --> 41:15.266
And then they go.

41:15.286 --> 41:16.268
And I said, where do they go?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.651
And Kenny says, there's a landfill.

41:20.437 --> 41:47.895
and of course these are very early books with nice pictorial and they don't preserve the bindings they just they they don't and they will make paper copies from their digital stuff and i think that's kind of a concession by the way to the print people this is just my guess i don't even know that i'm sure that's a great it's a great fall and she showed me some she well this is their making of america series and so they had a bunch of harper's weeklies and monthlies

41:48.432 --> 41:52.196
We punched up some stuff, and I said, you know, that's a Winslow Homer engraving.

41:54.318 --> 41:55.179
What happened to that?

41:55.339 --> 41:56.501
To the original?

41:56.521 --> 41:57.262
Yeah, what happened?

41:57.502 --> 42:01.266
I said, but do you know that there were no wood blocks preserved from Winslow?

42:01.286 --> 42:03.648
You know, the engraving is as good as anybody has.

42:04.730 --> 42:05.350
They don't care.

42:05.570 --> 42:06.311
They don't understand.

42:06.471 --> 42:08.073
They don't care, but you've got the picture here.

42:08.714 --> 42:16.262
And you know, the day I walked into the, this was funny, the day I walked into the brand new Di Ducci Bibliotech in Frankfurt,

42:16.968 --> 42:18.010
the computers were down.

42:18.811 --> 42:22.978
So you had a bunch of people sitting there unable to do a goddamn thing.

42:24.721 --> 42:29.369
Everything was down, you know.

42:31.693 --> 42:32.594
I don't know, I don't know.

42:32.694 --> 42:34.217
Very, very, very.

42:35.497 --> 42:37.019
You came from publishing.

42:37.059 --> 42:45.250
Can you just give me a little bit more about your background and what you're doing now, by the way, as much as you can... Through all this, my interest was in African-American culture and history.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.692
Okay, this is great.

42:47.232 --> 43:04.575
So I left the New York public to work at Columbia University on an encyclopedia of African-American culture and history for Macmillan, and then to Harvard to the...

43:04.825 --> 43:06.528
W.E.B.

43:06.548 --> 43:08.631
Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research.

43:08.651 --> 43:09.773
Do you know Charles Blockson?

43:09.893 --> 43:10.815
Oh, very well.

43:10.975 --> 43:13.740
Charles is one of my guys, one of the characters people in my book.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.681
He is a character.

43:14.761 --> 43:15.583
In my book.

43:15.603 --> 43:18.808
And he is a great collector and a great person.

43:18.888 --> 43:19.609
And I love him.

43:21.633 --> 43:23.736
Charles and I vote that you can grow your club together.

43:24.097 --> 43:27.222
Neither one of us would ever be invited.

43:27.202 --> 43:35.393
I turned down the invitation because I said I already had a place to go to the bathroom in that section of New York.

43:35.413 --> 43:42.622
It's good to me because I go to these things and the stories I'm directed to are quite marvelous.

43:42.802 --> 43:46.567
It's a great group of people and knowledgeable.

43:46.587 --> 43:48.770
These are the people who, these are book people.

43:49.751 --> 43:54.137
At the dinner or two weeks I sat with Tom Tanzel for instance,

43:54.826 --> 43:59.253
We don't have a chapter on bibliography, by the way, but I'm going to try and make this.

44:00.715 --> 44:05.502
I've done a lot of work in African-American bibliography, because that's so essential.

44:05.522 --> 44:10.349
You have to have bibliography before you can do anything else.

44:10.369 --> 44:12.552
It's as simple as that.

44:12.572 --> 44:13.474
I mean, you have to have a list.

44:13.494 --> 44:19.062
Well, some people might say, when I was in Rome, I saw Father Boyle, who recently

44:19.345 --> 44:23.271
has left his prefect at the... No, he's running this.

44:23.491 --> 44:24.052
It was wonderful.

44:24.092 --> 44:26.556
And I didn't even... I don't know why he left, and I don't care.

44:26.636 --> 44:28.939
He's still one of the great bookmen of his generation.

44:28.959 --> 44:29.840
You know what I mean?

44:29.860 --> 44:31.863
They're getting rid of conservatives is what they were doing.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.988
If you notice the list of cardinals... I mean, they're getting rid of liberals.

44:35.008 --> 44:37.111
They're all dead.

44:37.632 --> 44:40.656
They're getting ready for the next election.

44:40.736 --> 44:48.728
And he was very conveniently moved aside the cover... There's no cover story, but I'm sure that Columbus...

44:49.433 --> 44:52.376
You know, the manuscript had something to do with it.

44:52.997 --> 44:53.638
Brilliant guy.

44:53.718 --> 44:54.839
I don't know if you've ever met him.

44:54.859 --> 44:55.200
I know who he is.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.001
Wonderful guy.

44:56.341 --> 45:00.466
But he is working on a project which began in 1886 on Aquinas.

45:00.646 --> 45:03.770
They expect it's going to take another hundred years.

45:03.790 --> 45:04.070
I'm sorry.

45:04.170 --> 45:05.231
How can you justify?

45:05.251 --> 45:13.181
I can't, but I mean, how do you explain to people why spending 200 years on Aquinas is necessary?

45:13.621 --> 45:16.825
Well, I can explain it in the sense that

45:17.429 --> 45:40.281
I've really spent my intellectual career working on African American culture and history, and so there's no area in American historical life that has been more neglected, unless maybe the neglect of scholarly interest in other minorities, women or immigrants or whatever.

45:41.223 --> 45:45.729
But it's very clear that there is an African-American culture.

45:45.749 --> 45:49.074
There is an African-American history, both of which used to be denied.

45:49.494 --> 45:50.836
We now know that that's true.

45:51.137 --> 45:54.701
And so the question is, how can you begin to think about that?

45:54.722 --> 45:56.384
How can you begin to study that?

45:56.404 --> 45:58.427
How can you begin to write about that?

45:58.447 --> 46:08.240
And until you first find out what exists, who has written what, Phyllis Wheatley, how many poems did she write?

46:08.340 --> 46:10.403
Where are they?

46:10.585 --> 46:13.389
Well, you can't tell that just from that little slim volume.

46:13.789 --> 46:14.410
No, no.

46:15.972 --> 46:24.684
You can't tell what's in there, but there are as many poems published in other newspapers.

46:25.885 --> 46:26.866
She wrote a second book.

46:27.067 --> 46:27.587
It's lost.

46:28.308 --> 46:29.089
How did you know that?

46:29.370 --> 46:32.614
Because it was advertised in the Boston newspaper.

46:32.674 --> 46:34.517
It was coming to be for sale.

46:34.537 --> 46:40.204
So you have to track down everything.

46:40.741 --> 46:44.767
Is this one of the things that you hope might turn up at some point?

46:44.807 --> 46:45.167
Of course.

46:45.207 --> 46:54.721
Yes, Henry Louis Gates hired somebody for the summer years ago to go to Philadelphia, spend the summer looking for it, because we think that's where it is.

46:54.741 --> 46:57.565
And so you're hopeful that it's... Why Philly?

46:57.665 --> 47:09.482
Because it was taken by her husband after her death, and we think he went to Philadelphia, and we think he, having no literary interest of his own, tried to sell it.

47:10.272 --> 47:26.816
So, you know, the point is that here is the first African American to publish a book, and one, there is no biography of her, and two, there is no comprehensive bibliography of her.

47:26.836 --> 47:38.153
So Thomas Aquinas, I mean, everybody who's serious enough to be a subject deserves, requires, it's necessary to have

47:38.723 --> 47:43.910
To know what has been said, what has been thought, what has he written, what has been written about him.

47:43.930 --> 47:44.691
I understand that.

47:45.051 --> 47:57.708
But in my own field, I think it's even more dramatic because people have been reading Thomas Aquinas for centuries, but we've just discovered Phyllis Wheatley, as it was.

47:57.728 --> 48:00.152
200 years after her death, we've just discovered her.

48:00.412 --> 48:01.233
That's right.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.877
She's still not a household name.

48:03.897 --> 48:08.022
But my point is, before the biography can be written,

48:08.440 --> 48:10.762
The bibliography has to be done.

48:10.782 --> 48:12.964
What did she write and when and why?

48:13.004 --> 48:14.386
Are you working on that?

48:14.526 --> 48:16.107
I'm not, but other people are.

48:16.187 --> 48:19.470
Here at the university?

48:19.991 --> 48:20.731
It's being done.

48:21.052 --> 48:23.934
So is there somebody who's coordinating all the episodes?

48:23.954 --> 48:24.875
No, no, no.

48:25.015 --> 48:27.638
It's more informal than that.

48:27.718 --> 48:35.325
African American Studies doesn't yet have the money, doesn't yet have the power centers that can.

48:35.727 --> 48:37.450
can do that kind of research.

48:37.470 --> 48:44.840
But scholars are doing it, sometimes on their own time, nights and weekends, because right now that's what has to be done.

48:46.202 --> 48:56.718
Everything's happening at once, but you have to go back at the same time you go forward if you're going to continue to go forward in an intelligent way.

48:56.738 --> 48:57.258
That's great.

48:58.320 --> 48:59.922
You were inspired.

49:00.062 --> 49:00.503
Thanks.

49:00.803 --> 49:05.189
How do I get in touch with you?

49:05.209 --> 49:07.733
Do you have a phone number I can write down here?

49:08.774 --> 49:11.118
Yeah, I have to look it up.

49:11.138 --> 49:12.059
I've got it.

49:12.079 --> 49:15.204
Oh, no, I have it right.

49:16.305 --> 49:17.968
Because I might want to go over some of these quotes.

49:17.988 --> 49:18.729
Oh, sure.

49:19.029 --> 49:20.611
And I'm happy to do that, by the way.

49:20.972 --> 49:21.513
Or more.

49:21.913 --> 49:25.258
I mean, 354-617.

49:25.660 --> 49:26.301
354-0366.

49:26.601 --> 49:29.265
Is that right?

49:29.545 --> 49:30.046
Yes, sir.

49:30.066 --> 49:31.387
Thank you.

49:31.608 --> 49:32.809
I do have to go.

49:32.869 --> 49:34.051
This is terrific.

49:34.091 --> 49:35.493
Somebody pays me for me.

49:35.573 --> 49:36.053
Not much.

49:36.594 --> 49:36.734
Thanks.

49:36.754 --> 49:41.720
But I will tell you one James Lennox story.

49:41.740 --> 49:47.328
As I say, we always said, Mr. Lennox said, Mr. Lennox, thanks, as if he were in the next room.

49:47.348 --> 49:53.676
And you know that he was the son of James Lennox, who made a fortune in New York.

49:53.696 --> 49:54.797
And then James Lennox, Jr.

49:54.837 --> 49:55.498
was in

49:56.390 --> 50:14.560
a melancholy Presbyterian who never married, who had no friends, but who increased the money that came to him and built a great, if not the greatest, American rare book collection.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.822
A better one is the Brown.

50:16.944 --> 50:17.785
Well, they were rivals.

50:18.326 --> 50:21.351
Well, they had the same— They had the same interest.

50:21.770 --> 50:22.671
Henry Stevens.

50:22.751 --> 50:23.351
Henry Stevens.

50:23.652 --> 50:29.297
And Stevens always gave the first choice to—who's the person at Brown?

50:29.517 --> 50:30.418
John Carter Brown.

50:30.438 --> 50:30.919
John Carter Brown.

50:33.181 --> 50:34.722
I write about them in my book.

50:35.323 --> 50:38.246
Anyway, the— You're over at the—where are you located?

50:38.266 --> 50:38.846
Do you have an address?

50:38.866 --> 50:39.927
Maybe I'll send you something.

50:40.027 --> 50:40.448
Oh, do.

50:40.628 --> 50:44.611
It's Du Bois Institute, 12 Quincy Street.

50:46.954 --> 50:50.477
But Mr.— 0213A, right?

50:51.014 --> 50:58.646
Mr. Lennox, Sr., had a reputation for being smart with money.

50:58.666 --> 51:10.344
And so somebody, an acquaintance, came to him and said, I have, you know, I've saved up a little money, and I'd like to invest it, and I don't know what to do.

51:10.364 --> 51:13.488
And, you know, I've heard that you're really good at this.

51:14.590 --> 51:18.456
Would you take my money and invest it for me, Mr. Lennox?

51:19.010 --> 51:21.554
The next senior said, sure, I'd be glad to.

51:22.215 --> 51:26.301
So he took the money and invested it and bought a farm.

51:28.364 --> 51:34.053
And the guy whose money it was thought, well, that's not very smart.

51:34.153 --> 51:36.917
I mean, I could have bought a farm myself.

51:37.606 --> 51:45.293
So he was the largest property owner in Manhattan.

51:45.373 --> 51:47.815
I knew that.

51:47.835 --> 51:52.399
He said, I don't think this is a very good investment.

51:52.419 --> 51:56.383
And so he went to Mr. Lennox and said, you know, I don't get it.

51:56.423 --> 51:58.085
I don't see this.

51:58.105 --> 52:03.730
And I said, if it's possible, frankly, I'd like my money back.

52:03.750 --> 52:07.393
And Mr. Lennox said, sure, sure, and gave him the money back.

52:08.234 --> 52:12.479
thought still that it was a good investment, so he kept the farm for himself.

52:13.460 --> 52:24.473
The farm is now known as from 68 to 73rd, from Park to 3rd.

52:26.816 --> 52:28.458
It was way outside of the center.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.882
And James Lennox, Jr.

52:31.962 --> 52:36.688
sold it off in very small pieces.

52:37.158 --> 52:44.171
Newbury bought land in Chicago by the acre and sold it by the running venture.

52:44.191 --> 52:48.339
How did he make his money?

52:48.479 --> 52:52.426
So I said, if you have a chance to buy a farm, do it.

52:52.787 --> 52:53.428
I think that's it.

52:53.746 --> 52:54.767
You're a great pleasure.

52:54.867 --> 52:57.030
And you're doing something very exciting.

52:57.451 --> 52:58.132
You're wonderful.

52:58.172 --> 53:00.995
Ken knows exactly what I need.

53:01.956 --> 53:04.540
I'll give you a call and say something.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.143
And we'll go over some of this.

53:07.203 --> 53:09.606
And I'm writing right now, which is really exciting.

53:09.766 --> 53:11.949
Can you research and write at the same time?

53:11.969 --> 53:14.472
Well, I've done 95% of the research.

53:17.396 --> 53:22.723
What I have here is a truck of books.

53:23.446 --> 53:38.846
that a computer scientist has written a program to tell me which are the books that are the best candidates to go out to story.

53:38.866 --> 53:52.744
And if he gets the circulation records and a file that has circulation records and date and language, et cetera, et cetera, he can rank all of the books in

53:52.927 --> 54:04.180
in order as to whether, you know, from the highest candidates for storage to the lowest candidates for storage.

54:05.902 --> 54:12.710
And I suggested as a sample that he do economics from the YLC class.

54:12.750 --> 54:13.832
Excellent.

54:13.852 --> 54:16.294
Do you, by the way, mind if I take a picture of you with this?

54:16.314 --> 54:17.556
Do you have any problems with that?

54:17.576 --> 54:18.056
No, no, I don't either.

54:18.077 --> 54:18.177
Good.

54:18.197 --> 54:21.921
Okay, because I know we're in Wagner and I don't like... I think that's where...

54:22.643 --> 54:26.428
Maybe I should put on my storage jacket here.

54:26.609 --> 54:27.610
Okay, good.

54:27.810 --> 54:30.053
Excellent.

54:32.617 --> 54:34.780
I like just where it is out that door.

54:35.381 --> 54:38.285
Or I can set off jackets.

54:38.485 --> 54:41.609
I like to have a college library.

54:41.629 --> 54:42.651
We can do both.

54:42.791 --> 54:44.493
I'm going to take a lot of pictures today.

54:48.339 --> 54:50.642
What I find is that

54:51.719 --> 55:09.593
I can look at these very quickly and make a decision about whether the programming is right.

55:09.775 --> 55:16.205
And this is one that caught my eye immediately because I figured, you know, ought not to go out to the repository.

55:16.225 --> 55:17.467
Not to go out.

55:17.487 --> 55:18.108
And that was what?

55:18.148 --> 55:18.689
What was that?

55:18.949 --> 55:29.526
Well, it happened to be a book on economics and it's called, in German, Economics and State in Germany during the Weimar Republic.

55:30.447 --> 55:37.318
And, of course, you know, seeing that the Weimar Republic led to

55:41.028 --> 55:46.776
Well, it just happened to be well.

55:47.337 --> 55:48.959
How many books would you say are on that truck?

55:48.979 --> 55:50.602
Can you call that a truck or a dolly?

55:50.642 --> 55:51.863
We call it a book truck.

55:51.884 --> 55:56.009
There are about 200 books on it, probably.

55:56.290 --> 55:59.114
And how long did it take to put that together?

55:59.334 --> 56:10.410
Well, actually, it took about two hours to pull the books that are on that truck.

56:11.150 --> 56:22.265
The interesting thing is that if I go out into an area that's, you know, ripe for pulling of stuff, I can pull a truck in an hour to an hour and a half.

56:22.466 --> 56:27.733
So I can actually do it faster than a student working from a list.

56:27.753 --> 56:29.956
But, of course, I get paid more than the student.

56:29.976 --> 56:38.247
And everything the student does, I gather that there will be a, somebody's going to look at this, somebody's going to pass on it before it signs off on it, I guess.

56:38.447 --> 56:40.330
As long as I'm doing it, yeah.

56:40.647 --> 56:45.273
I mean, if something a student does, is that the final say?

56:45.394 --> 56:46.415
No, no, no, no, no, no.

56:46.435 --> 56:48.718
Will there be a supervisor of sorts there?

56:48.738 --> 57:00.375
Well, I mean, I am, you know, looking at the books before they go out, although I'm not looking in a way... Now, why is that?

57:00.395 --> 57:02.538
Does that basically say that's staying or that's going?

57:02.618 --> 57:03.639
No, that's staying.

57:03.719 --> 57:07.785
So when you put it down on its spine like that,

57:08.558 --> 57:10.580
You see, not so fast at this point.

57:11.061 --> 57:11.762
Yeah, exactly.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.004
But I don't, you know, but most of them.

57:14.024 --> 57:22.234
You know, the last truck I looked at, I think there were only seven books that I felt really needed to stay here.

57:22.254 --> 57:23.776
So they've done a pretty good job.

57:23.796 --> 57:26.720
So the computer program is working, you know?

57:26.880 --> 57:28.682
Yeah, that's it.

57:28.822 --> 57:38.093
And since, you know, I only spent about ten minutes or so on the...

57:38.697 --> 57:40.520
on the truck.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.161
That's not bad.

57:41.181 --> 57:50.995
You mentioned this Knowledge Wins poster in my last interview, and I wasn't sure.

57:51.015 --> 57:53.259
Yeah, I put that in bookshop.

57:53.279 --> 57:54.621
You went to Bowdoin, by the way.

57:54.941 --> 57:55.182
Yeah.

57:55.202 --> 57:57.986
I went to Bates, so there's a... Yeah, yeah.

57:58.006 --> 57:59.748
I was going through your Vita the other day.

58:00.029 --> 58:06.639
Yeah, yeah.

58:06.739 --> 58:07.540
Most of these

58:07.739 --> 58:10.202
We'll take a look at it and see.

58:10.222 --> 58:12.524
No one's ever... Well, there is one.

58:14.106 --> 58:21.213
But you can even feel, you know, by the... It's never been read.

58:21.314 --> 58:21.994
Hear the noise.

58:22.054 --> 58:24.617
That's a book that's never been read.

58:24.817 --> 58:33.266
But I try not to emphasize that there are books around here that haven't been read because, you know... We dealt with that when we spoke last time.

58:33.286 --> 58:35.709
And when you see this, I get into that.

58:36.229 --> 58:36.750
Yeah.

58:36.781 --> 58:53.411
No, I think what you said is institutional histories, amateur histories, philatelic material that you had hundreds of copies of, defense department training manuals.

58:53.431 --> 58:54.874
These are easy.

58:54.894 --> 58:56.697
These are very easy.

58:57.453 --> 59:01.797
But you said contemporary fiction and poetry, too, which I found interesting.

59:01.817 --> 59:04.119
So there isn't that much call for contemporary fiction?

59:04.139 --> 59:06.221
Well, in English there is.

59:06.241 --> 59:06.441
No.

59:06.461 --> 59:10.364
In English there is.

59:12.186 --> 59:18.471
Now what's this here you're holding?

59:18.491 --> 59:22.615
Well, it's a... This happens to be a press script as well.

59:22.635 --> 59:27.139
And on...

59:27.490 --> 59:35.519
economic development in the Mediterranean and on the continent of Europe.

59:35.539 --> 59:56.181
And in a way, and Hermann, you know, it's a question for Hermann Cullenbest, a great German economic historian, but it's been here now for

59:58.372 --> 01:00:03.439
It came in in 79, so it's been here for 20 years.

01:00:03.579 --> 01:00:26.269
Well, it has been borrowed once, and in a way I hate to send it out, but I think that at this point it's not going to be used because someone stumbles across an article there because the content was so diverse.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:31.858
But rather that it's going to be used because... So what's the book we're talking about, Ken?

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.627
This might be a little C, you know, I mean... There's a chance I could get a copy of the title.

01:00:39.907 --> 01:00:40.288
Sure.

01:00:40.308 --> 01:00:43.171
Let me go.

01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:51.860
This would make a very interesting... You say this is a very difficult choice.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.401
Yeah.

01:00:52.421 --> 01:00:54.022
We're talking about the worst... How do you say that?

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.564
Would you pronounce it?

01:00:56.033 --> 01:00:59.197
Wirtschaftskräfte und Wirtschaftswege.

01:00:59.217 --> 01:01:01.500
And translates, how would that translate?

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.784
Well, let me... I'm here to talk today, I'm sorry.

01:01:04.804 --> 01:01:17.540
I'm not, you know, those are funny kinds of... An approximation, just... I wouldn't put it direct, but just... Economic strength and development.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.521
Okay, good, cool.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:18.901
That's fine.

01:01:19.402 --> 01:01:20.483
But that's a difficult choice.

01:01:20.503 --> 01:01:23.627
That's why it's a bit necessary for me to know why it's a difficult choice.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:28.837
And it's a difficult choice, and I can, you know, find good translations.

01:01:28.857 --> 01:01:53.800
I find it a difficult choice because it's a real scholarly, you know, it's a hard-core scholarly book, and covering all kinds of topics that historians, medievalists, are going to be interested in here.

01:01:54.083 --> 01:02:13.569
the interest and interest fluctuation in Basel, 1360 to 1535, and the history of the Levant pepper trade around 1500.

01:02:13.709 --> 01:02:20.558
And this is a Widener book, not a Crest book, right?

01:02:20.578 --> 01:02:23.702
It's a Widener book, and there are five volumes of this.

01:02:24.138 --> 01:02:25.443
of this pressure.

01:02:25.463 --> 01:02:26.668
You have five copies of this?

01:02:26.768 --> 01:02:28.294
No, it's a five-volume book.

01:02:28.315 --> 01:02:29.037
It's a five-volume work.

01:02:29.218 --> 01:02:29.700
Okay.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.519
Because Kellen Benz is a major... No, I cannot...
