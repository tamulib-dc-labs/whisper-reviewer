00:02.090 --> 00:19.154
You mentioned in the Man Ray book and in this book that a compelling reason to do these biographies is that you had read the memoirs of both these people, and they are notable not only for what they say, but for what they don't say.

00:19.214 --> 00:22.459
Good question.

00:22.479 --> 00:25.063
And, you know, maybe you could talk a little bit about that.

00:25.083 --> 00:30.831
Well, especially in the case of Thomas Edison, what I did was, when I first decided...

00:31.250 --> 00:57.578
I read every every existing biography of Thomas Edison starting in the 1870s and 80s when the first when the first biographies of him were published when he was still a young man and I came away thinking the mythic dimension of this person has been covered has been done to death the apocryphal stories and

00:57.912 --> 01:11.954
the sort of received information that we all have in our unconscious mind about the Horatio Algerman story of the young man growing up and overcoming his disability and becoming a great American hero.

01:11.974 --> 01:17.242
And I decided that that was going to be the foundation for the book.

01:17.422 --> 01:18.664
I was going to build on the myth.

01:18.744 --> 01:20.386
I was not going to devote the myth.

01:20.827 --> 01:24.032
I was not going to deconstruct the myth.

01:24.132 --> 01:25.995
I was not going to intellectualize the myth.

01:26.195 --> 01:37.687
I was going to use the myth as a foundation to build upon and show that when you measure that against the actual fact of his life, he becomes an even more admirable figure.

01:37.707 --> 01:40.770
The myth doesn't do justice to him.

01:40.790 --> 01:43.993
The reality does justice to him.

01:44.013 --> 01:50.780
I came away confirming my belief that he is a genius, and I don't use that term loosely.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.965
The actuality of his life, the actual accomplishment, and the number of things he

01:56.215 --> 02:00.840
that he thought of that never even got to become invention, staggering.

02:00.860 --> 02:08.167
He had over a thousand patents, but he had over another thousand ideas that never became patents.

02:08.187 --> 02:25.665
Immediately reflected in the journal, I guess, that you're hopeful of... I guess I can't say for this, but my agency has talked to five or six major magazines about

02:26.320 --> 02:38.519
I didn't know that, by the way.

02:41.283 --> 02:46.391
Yeah, no, a lot of things people didn't know.

02:46.411 --> 02:47.753
I think that's what I mean.

02:47.793 --> 02:52.260
There's so much that people think they know, and there's so much that they...

02:52.392 --> 02:53.494
don't know.

02:53.794 --> 02:58.360
For instance, this whole rubber thing is fascinating.

02:58.681 --> 03:02.045
But that didn't stand out, right?

03:02.326 --> 03:16.004
But the point is that he even thought to do it, A. And B, did you know that he assembled, which is still to date, the most definitive herbarium of rubber-bearing plants in the world?

03:16.064 --> 03:21.572
The herbarium is a collection of scientifically

03:21.907 --> 03:30.699
scientifically assembled and collected and archivally preserved specimens of plants by genus and species.

03:30.839 --> 03:33.643
So I've seen Henry Hutchinson's cat produce plants.

03:34.364 --> 03:34.524
Oh.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.749
Have you ever been to the Hutchinson Library in California?

03:37.769 --> 03:37.989
No.

03:38.390 --> 03:40.012
You know, my wife loves gardens.

03:40.032 --> 03:41.514
You mentioned your wife loves gardens.

03:41.574 --> 03:43.577
I mean, I go out there and go to the library.

03:44.131 --> 03:45.893
It's a little extraordinary.

03:45.913 --> 03:53.023
And he has the largest collection of cacti, I guess, in one day, 2,500 cacti.

03:53.824 --> 03:58.511
So apparently Edison did the same thing with the... He went around the country.

03:58.531 --> 04:13.311
He also had sort of specimen collectors that he hired to go out to the countryside, and especially by the railroad tracks where the goldenrod-type weeds grow in perfusion and collect clippings from all over the...

04:13.578 --> 04:15.041
all over the world.

04:15.181 --> 04:24.320
We have clippings from Russia, Eastern Europe, China, and they're all arranged on this archival paper.

04:24.340 --> 04:33.780
They're in these hermetically humidity-controlled cabinets, custom-made oak cabinets.

04:34.250 --> 04:38.454
And the guy was obsessed.

04:38.594 --> 04:43.218
When I come to transcribe it, that last factor is going to be right there on the table.

04:43.418 --> 04:49.243
This is a very strong... No, this is good, but it's really... But there are certain things like that that people pick up.

04:49.263 --> 04:50.464
But this is fine.

04:51.145 --> 05:03.295
That's why it's supposed to be... The medical... I just mean the point is that once he got his idea on something that he wanted to define, encompass...

05:04.135 --> 05:26.818
The concrete house, the ore milling, the whole industrial side of him that most people don't know of, the fact that he spent a decade of his life searching for a process to refine iron ore and to create briquettes for industrial consumption.

05:26.878 --> 05:34.125
He built an entire iron mine up in northwestern Jersey.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.122
And he lived up there.

05:36.142 --> 05:44.014
He commuted home on the weekends, but he lived up there in this little shack basically for 10 years at the end of the century.

05:44.094 --> 05:59.316
Then he went from that right into the concrete business, designed a concrete house that was like the first prefabricated house in America, poured in a mold from the top.

05:59.696 --> 06:01.699
The entire house was made from one mold.

06:01.983 --> 06:09.713
was poured in from the top to a funnel opening, liquid cemented, hardened, took the mold off.

06:10.334 --> 06:13.618
Do you have any sense of, I mean, do you?

06:13.738 --> 06:17.683
No, Jenny suggested the closing idea.

06:17.703 --> 06:18.684
What did you do?

06:19.265 --> 06:20.106
I laughed.

06:20.387 --> 06:23.130
I said to her, the very thing I discussed in the scene to you, I said,

06:23.448 --> 06:30.198
Thomas Edison, I laughed, I said, hasn't there been enough on Thomas Edison?

06:30.518 --> 06:39.551
She said, check in books and friends, and let's see that the last biography was 15 years ago.

06:40.893 --> 06:43.056
It was called A Streak of Luck.

06:43.076 --> 06:45.559
I think I have it.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.907
The problem I have with A Streak of Luck is basically the premise.

06:51.207 --> 07:17.299
of the title is erroneous there is no luck well he says right now he quotes 90 i don't believe in luck you know inspiration but he's basically hard work the problem with the streak of luck is and it has it's not a bad book but it's overly thin it's overly weighted toward the beginning of his life it's yeah it sort of spins out

07:17.482 --> 07:22.430
and he seems to almost lose interest in the last 25 years of Thomas Edison.

07:22.450 --> 07:34.288
The predecessor, Matthew Josephson's book, Edison, 1959, more interesting, more entertainingly written, of course, Matthew Josephson is a journalist.

07:34.349 --> 07:37.934
He was part of the Paris generation.

07:38.014 --> 07:39.336
He lived in the 22,000 Paris.

07:39.356 --> 07:44.164
He was friends with Williams and all those people, and he had more of a stylistic flair

07:44.617 --> 07:46.118
But it's too worshipful.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.360
It's ours too far in the other direction.

07:48.420 --> 07:53.205
It's too sycophantic and worshipful.

07:53.605 --> 08:01.913
I wanted to construct something from the ground up, and I went back to his antecedents.

08:01.933 --> 08:12.042
I wanted to find out more about his ancestry and his Canadian side, his Dutch side, what really happened during his childhood.

08:12.376 --> 08:21.666
And of course, the main breakthrough for me was this huge archive of correspondence that his wife had.

08:21.806 --> 08:32.277
14,000 letters that never came by anybody.

08:32.978 --> 08:38.063
I was very fortunate, but I'm the first biographer, too.

08:38.245 --> 08:47.999
ingratiate myself, not ingratiate, but to obtain the trust and the cooperation of both sides of the family.

08:48.059 --> 09:01.577
The Edison side, the Miller family, his wife's side, Mina Miller, his niece, was very helpful to me.

09:01.597 --> 09:06.284
Thank you.

09:06.304 --> 09:07.746
Thank you.

09:08.283 --> 09:19.459
So I spent an entire summer looking at 14,000 frames of microphones of correspondence from all of his children.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.201
Oh, it is all a microphone.

09:21.221 --> 09:34.240
And that gave me the human side that had been totally lacking, you know, the story of the man behind the invention, not about the... And where did you do all this?

09:34.260 --> 09:34.560
Well...

09:36.532 --> 09:49.674
The microfilms have been in a safe deposit world for four decades.

09:51.217 --> 10:01.695
They're owned by the Charles Edison Fund, which is a foundation that was established by Thomas Edison's older son by his second marriage.

10:02.401 --> 10:06.107
So, technically, they didn't have to let you see them then, did they?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.109
No, they did not.

10:07.129 --> 10:08.371
They're not in the public report.

10:08.391 --> 10:09.192
No, they are not.

10:10.214 --> 10:28.003
But through the trustees, the trustees, Nancy R-N-A-R-N-N, Springline Miller's niece, she introduced me to the people there, and they...

10:28.304 --> 10:38.278
Read my other works, and I told them I wouldn't use any restricted, some restricted material, which I said, which they didn't show me, and I said, fine.

10:38.298 --> 10:40.922
You know, very small, relatively small amount of restricted material.

10:42.043 --> 10:50.295
And they gave me the microfilms, and I borrowed them for a few months, and I went to the public library, since I don't have access to it.

10:50.596 --> 11:05.554
I went to the Clifton Public Library, and I read all the microfilms at night, and the library is open until 9 o'clock at night, and that's what I did.

11:07.236 --> 11:10.320
That's really great that you're able to do that here.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.823
You don't have to go spend two or three weeks at a time.

11:13.732 --> 11:26.393
That's the edition that you sent me.

11:26.714 --> 11:28.517
No, it's to Capo, the paperback.

11:28.637 --> 11:29.979
So that's the one you sent me.

11:29.999 --> 11:30.721
The Man Ray book.

11:30.781 --> 11:31.562
That's the paperback.

11:31.943 --> 11:33.485
Oh, is that what I... That's fine.

11:33.505 --> 11:33.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:33.946 --> 11:35.629
But that's the one that's in print, yeah.

11:35.649 --> 11:37.031
And is the Williams book in print?

11:37.432 --> 11:37.853
No.

11:37.873 --> 11:38.153
No, okay.

11:38.285 --> 11:39.928
I thought we put all the title issues.

11:39.988 --> 11:41.871
No, no, only the books that are written.

11:41.931 --> 11:42.712
James and Prince.

11:42.792 --> 11:43.714
It just went out of print.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.797
It was in print for about nine years.

11:45.937 --> 11:47.119
Did that have a paperback?

11:48.721 --> 11:48.962
No.

11:49.322 --> 11:51.526
How did that do, by the way?

11:51.546 --> 11:52.447
Do we talk sales?

11:53.349 --> 11:54.270
Not for this audience.

11:54.531 --> 11:54.931
Okay.

11:55.732 --> 11:59.979
Can you tell me what the first printing is in the Edison book?

11:59.999 --> 12:02.623
You know, I think it's been upgraded.

12:02.683 --> 12:04.526
I think you should ask Hyperion.

12:04.546 --> 12:04.647
Okay.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.608
Because...

12:06.128 --> 12:12.216
in the last couple of weeks of the Publisher's Weekly Review, and then the Barnes and Noble thing.

12:12.616 --> 12:13.537
Did I tell you about that?

12:13.557 --> 12:14.458
Oh, you did.

12:14.498 --> 12:15.860
Yeah, you showed it to me.

12:15.880 --> 12:20.566
This is the Barnes and Noble feature front page.

12:21.487 --> 12:22.648
That's great.

12:22.689 --> 12:25.512
They must have to up the first printing.

12:25.532 --> 12:26.754
That's great.

12:26.774 --> 12:31.620
I would ask Jennifer.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.121
Any big surprises for you?

12:33.142 --> 12:34.363
I mean, did the guy...

12:35.879 --> 12:37.422
Did the guy come alive for you?

12:37.482 --> 12:41.930
Did you feel that you got a handle on this solution?

12:41.950 --> 12:48.762
I know you mentioned in the Man Ray book that there was a chain of enigmas.

12:48.822 --> 12:52.348
A chain of enigmas was the phrase you used for Man Ray.

12:52.368 --> 12:55.474
I'm not so sure that there are as many enigmas here.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.708
It might, but there still must have been surprises.

12:59.710 --> 13:00.030
Yeah.

13:00.431 --> 13:04.039
But anyway, you can answer that any way you want.

13:04.059 --> 13:04.820
I'll respond to it.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.722
Thank you.

13:05.762 --> 13:06.283
Surprises?

13:06.964 --> 13:07.987
Never mind surprises.

13:08.247 --> 13:08.447
Yeah.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.712
Well, I mean, what...

13:10.979 --> 13:12.341
What are the things you learned about the guy?

13:13.062 --> 13:13.983
Did he live for you?

13:14.684 --> 13:18.088
Yes, because there are two things that struck me.

13:18.108 --> 13:26.479
The first was the sheer magnitude of what he did with his time.

13:28.081 --> 13:31.445
The sheer amount of work, the productivity of the man.

13:32.626 --> 13:39.535
As I say, for every invention that saw the light of day, there was one that didn't.

13:39.920 --> 14:04.729
was developed and cultivated that he thought of and his ability to harness the energies of other people all the incredibly intelligent people that i talk about in the book the cast of characters most of whom no one's ever heard of who labored and worked for him and gave him their their psyches and their energies over the course of three or four or five decades and were totally loyal to him

14:06.515 --> 14:19.410
that he had the ability to marshal the devotion of these people and to have their energy feed into his success.

14:19.430 --> 14:23.054
He was a very charismatic leader and a very adept leader.

14:25.156 --> 14:29.882
But on the flip side, his family relationships were very unsuccessful.

14:31.364 --> 14:36.049
Even his great-grandchildren,

14:36.502 --> 14:46.872
The distant descendants of him that I've met, they seem to suffer from being in the shadow, the giant shadow of Thomas Edison.

14:46.973 --> 14:47.874
It's gotta be hard.

14:49.355 --> 14:54.640
Well, his son Charles wrote a book, a memoir of Charles Edison.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.402
It's called Out of the Shadow.

14:57.243 --> 15:01.227
But he never really came out of the shadow entirely.

15:01.831 --> 15:12.965
To have someone with a household name be your father or your stepfather, that is the theme that you get from these six children corresponding that I mentioned earlier.

15:13.886 --> 15:16.069
You know, will he like this?

15:16.129 --> 15:17.972
Will he appreciate this?

15:18.052 --> 15:19.273
Am I good enough for him?

15:20.495 --> 15:22.918
You know, I've always measured myself against him.

15:23.018 --> 15:24.900
I'll never be as good as he was.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.602
I'll never be as smart as he was.

15:26.623 --> 15:28.044
I'll never be as successful as he was.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.167
And I think this sort of...

15:30.569 --> 15:33.434
pervasive hang-up that all his children had.

15:34.996 --> 15:36.879
He did nothing to discourage that.

15:37.901 --> 15:38.301
Nothing.

15:38.482 --> 15:43.369
He really kept them at arm's length.

15:44.732 --> 15:51.703
And part of that was just he didn't have the time to treat that first wife so unkindly?

15:51.823 --> 15:55.128
Well, he was obsessed with his own rise to fame.

15:55.629 --> 15:57.572
By the time he married the second woman,

15:58.109 --> 16:06.039
He was a millionaire, and he had already leveled off, and she had much more of a self-image, much better self-image than her first wife.

16:06.099 --> 16:21.619
She was a fully formed person, and she had her own life, and she really, even though she worshipped him and lived for him, she also had her own identity, and she had causes, and she belonged to a lot of different boards.

16:22.139 --> 16:33.691
community beautification and the Chautauqua institution, of course, and the church and the YMCA and the women's clubs with the oranges and all these other things, that she had a life.

16:33.711 --> 16:34.271
She had a life.

16:35.172 --> 16:38.155
But she suffered from neglect and loneliness.

16:38.235 --> 16:39.817
I go into that in the book.

16:40.918 --> 16:45.022
There's a little bit of correspondence from him that she saves.

16:45.042 --> 16:49.127
You know, he tries to get her to come up and stay with him up in the mine.

16:49.227 --> 16:51.589
She doesn't want to.

16:51.991 --> 16:53.553
And he resented that.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.761
I found it amusing just how apathetic he was to the artifacts.

16:59.842 --> 17:03.987
Like you mentioned how Henry before, he was just letting Menlo park go to... Who cares?

17:04.047 --> 17:04.969
I mean, this is past.

17:07.372 --> 17:12.899
I think I had no sense of... I mean, like, I would be grabbing all these little things.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.707
No, the most important thing to him was up here in his noodle, you know, in his noggin.

17:19.295 --> 17:20.957
That was his most precious resource.

17:21.037 --> 17:25.902
And then those notebooks, this is the thing, he saved every one of those notebooks.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.925
They are an unbroken chronicle.

17:29.226 --> 17:30.447
So that's a good quote.

17:30.487 --> 17:33.050
Why don't you just continue with that?

17:33.070 --> 17:39.036
He had 3,500 notebooks, starting in 1870s and all the way to the 1930s.

17:40.958 --> 17:46.264
He must have had some inherent idea of the value of this, what he was doing, because those are

17:46.750 --> 17:57.340
a seamless narrative of everything he worked on from A to Z. Do you think he kept them with the expectation that others would be reading them?

17:57.440 --> 18:10.873
No, he kept them as a record because when you're involved in patent development, you have to have a meticulous record of the chronology of everything you do.

18:11.374 --> 18:12.635
Everything is dated.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.817
Everything has the time of day on it.

18:15.117 --> 18:18.360
or 3 o'clock in the morning or 4 o'clock in the morning or whatever.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.883
I mean, that's how you can tell what kind of work schedule we had.

18:21.903 --> 18:23.284
It's 5.30 a.m.

18:23.304 --> 18:25.046
We're closing our labors for today.

18:25.086 --> 18:26.967
You know, 7.30 a.m.

18:27.007 --> 18:27.568
Took a nap.

18:27.588 --> 18:29.089
Now I'm going to start doing this again.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.992
I am the first person to think of this.

18:32.012 --> 18:33.613
I am the first person to think of that.

18:34.594 --> 18:37.716
I decided that we should put this wire next to that wire.

18:37.877 --> 18:44.162
All this is necessary when you're creating products

18:45.256 --> 18:50.944
to counter the other people who come along and say, well, I thought of that, too.

18:50.984 --> 18:56.552
And you say, well, I, you know, and they have witnesses, two witnesses to each thing.

18:57.734 --> 19:02.501
You know, I'm going through the same thing in a very small way with my little literary feature syndicate.

19:02.521 --> 19:04.945
I haven't got a trademark for that.

19:04.965 --> 19:06.427
If I were you, I'd do that right away.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.131
Because it's a terrific name.

19:09.912 --> 19:10.453
Yes, it is.

19:11.534 --> 19:12.175
I mean,

19:12.644 --> 19:15.488
But I can demonstrate how long I've been using it.

19:15.588 --> 19:19.293
I've got checks that come to me that are made out to the syndic, you know what I'm saying?

19:19.613 --> 19:20.775
But it's the same thing that you're saying.

19:20.795 --> 19:24.680
You can demonstrate how long you've had it.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.583
I mean, you've got a claim to it, don't you?

19:26.603 --> 19:30.328
Well, he was very into the proprietorship of ideas.

19:31.329 --> 19:35.254
Ideas were his most precious commodity, and he was an endless fount of ideas.

19:35.755 --> 19:37.718
And then other people enacted them.

19:37.738 --> 19:39.580
But he was the one that sat there

19:40.049 --> 19:42.533
you know, just disgorging these ideas.

19:42.613 --> 19:48.181
And, you know, you point out, in a number of different things, he wasn't really the first one with the idea.

19:48.221 --> 19:48.942
No.

19:49.704 --> 19:52.167
He was the one that... But he was the one that made it practical.

19:52.207 --> 19:57.836
He made it practical, and he had the best people who could, you know, put the thing together.

19:57.856 --> 19:59.158
He had draftsmen.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.600
He had excellent mechanics.

20:01.101 --> 20:04.967
He had excellent fabricators of his models, you know.

20:05.327 --> 20:07.170
He had excellent chemists.

20:07.403 --> 20:08.825
He had excellent electricians.

20:08.845 --> 20:10.747
He had the top people in every field.

20:11.448 --> 20:14.332
And they worked for him.

20:14.392 --> 20:16.655
He gave him a piece of the action financially.

20:17.136 --> 20:21.121
You mentioned that his health was paid beautifully.

20:21.462 --> 20:26.368
But in exchange for that, you've never heard of Francis Upton.

20:26.388 --> 20:28.010
You've never heard of Charles Batchelor.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.692
You've never heard of Samuel Insull.

20:30.153 --> 20:35.520
These are people you've never heard of because they basically sold their soul to him.

20:35.669 --> 20:42.478
You point out how Bachelor always made very clear, even when writing home, this is Mr. Edison.

20:42.919 --> 20:43.780
This is Edison.

20:43.800 --> 20:44.541
This is his game.

20:45.182 --> 20:50.529
I get rid of the glory for Nelson.

20:50.549 --> 20:54.254
And, you know, it's almost like Bill Gates today, in a way, is that I was thinking.

20:54.415 --> 21:03.307
It's funny you mention Bill Gates, because in the New Yorker profile on Bill Gates last year, they use the analogy.

21:03.327 --> 21:04.048
Do they?

21:04.088 --> 21:04.208
Uh-uh.

21:04.745 --> 21:07.489
The Edisonian analogy.

21:07.509 --> 21:08.990
It's there.

21:09.571 --> 21:10.552
I think of him.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.575
In fact, that's the last event.

21:13.516 --> 21:15.599
Oh, I'd love it if you could mention that.

21:15.619 --> 21:16.420
Yeah, well.

21:16.440 --> 21:28.035
Because at this point, I'm very excited about it because a year ago, I mean, a lot of things have happened in the past couple of months, build up and...

21:28.319 --> 21:38.779
Um, they're sending me, uh, well, at this moment, as of this discussion, all we have now is a week in Florida to start with, Epcot, for two days.

21:38.939 --> 21:41.023
You going to Gainesville?

21:41.043 --> 21:45.231
I'm going to Epcot, Fort Myers in Miami at the moment.

21:45.532 --> 21:48.596
But Jennifer... You don't have to go there, because I write for them.

21:48.616 --> 21:51.740
They will get... No, I'm not going there.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.365
But Jennifer might have more information about where else she's been.

21:55.686 --> 21:58.109
But it might help me get some Florida papers.

21:58.129 --> 22:00.192
Oh, once I find out, I'll tell you.

22:01.193 --> 22:02.775
I will tell you as soon as I find out.

22:03.196 --> 22:08.903
But they're having a little party, which I'll invite you to.

22:08.944 --> 22:13.950
Patricia Bosworth, who's an author, she wrote the Diane Arbus biography.

22:14.030 --> 22:14.611
Oh, yeah.

22:14.631 --> 22:15.252
Oh, I interviewed her.

22:15.704 --> 22:17.006
She's a good friend of mine.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.168
She's having a party for me.

22:18.428 --> 22:20.231
I like that book.

22:20.251 --> 22:25.118
And then on March 14th, I'm giving a big slide show at the National Arts Club.

22:25.379 --> 22:27.081
I'm going to do a Thomas Edison slide show.

22:27.442 --> 22:28.904
I'm going to have a hundred slides.

22:29.004 --> 22:30.526
I'm going to get all my pictures.

22:31.288 --> 22:33.771
Many of them are not even in the book, like the one I show you.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.936
I'm going to get slides made up and do this very...

22:37.642 --> 22:42.729
interesting chronological glide show and talk about kind of that and sell the book.

22:42.769 --> 22:44.010
Where is it going to be?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.073
National Arts Club, March 14th.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.516
That's in New York, is it?

22:48.537 --> 22:50.659
Yeah, Gramercy Park, which is where he lives.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.322
He lives right next door.

22:52.342 --> 22:54.765
It's where the Players Club lives.

22:54.805 --> 22:57.408
Right next to Players Club.

22:58.269 --> 23:03.436
But in the next couple of weeks, they'll start to put my tour together, and so I'll be able to know.

23:04.257 --> 23:04.678
Let me know.

23:06.515 --> 23:07.436
Yeah, I will.

23:07.536 --> 23:09.678
It might help me tie it in.

23:10.379 --> 23:13.061
You know, again, I... You've written poetry?

23:13.081 --> 23:14.703
Have you published poetry?

23:14.743 --> 23:17.246
Oh, yeah, we didn't get into it.

23:17.266 --> 23:23.071
I've published several books of poetry with a small press called the Salt Works Press.

23:23.091 --> 23:23.652
Where are they at?

23:23.912 --> 23:30.178
They're now in Colorado, but they were in Martha's Vineyard.

23:30.779 --> 23:32.020
They were at the beginning.

23:32.501 --> 23:32.961
Where?

23:33.278 --> 23:46.439
And then I published a book, The Poetry Writing Handbook, that was published by Scholastic, and that was a textbook.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.742
You mentioned that one.

23:47.782 --> 23:48.803
And that did very well.

23:48.823 --> 23:51.808
It was offered by the Teacher's Book Club.

23:51.928 --> 23:52.449
Great.

23:52.469 --> 23:54.793
What were the titles of the poetry collections?

23:54.813 --> 23:58.760
One was called, well, the major one was called On the Trail of Messages.

23:59.701 --> 24:00.282
What year?

24:03.535 --> 24:04.777
78, okay.

24:05.718 --> 24:13.147
And then the Poetry Writing Handbook and the G.K.

24:13.227 --> 24:18.393
Hall, the thank you, the William Coles Williams catalog.

24:20.015 --> 24:29.627
And then I did a study guide to a separate piece published by Barron's study guide, like a

24:31.480 --> 24:34.844
A higher level cliff note, I think.

24:34.864 --> 24:35.886
It's still in print.

24:36.146 --> 24:37.648
I still get royalties from that.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.331
I thought I did a very good job on that.

24:41.913 --> 24:45.618
And then the three biographies, and now I'm doing the Mexican book.

24:45.998 --> 24:48.642
Do you still write poetry?

24:49.042 --> 24:50.224
No, I don't.

24:50.464 --> 24:52.647
I stopped writing poetry when my kids were born.

24:53.448 --> 24:59.395
I feel that definitely the poetry that I was writing was supplanted by...

24:59.712 --> 25:01.554
the reality of having kids.

25:02.155 --> 25:03.956
I feel that the kids were the poetry.

25:04.217 --> 25:10.503
I definitely feel that the poetry ended when the kids came, and I know why that is.

25:13.666 --> 25:18.732
I'm convinced of that.

25:18.752 --> 25:19.492
Good stuff.

25:19.632 --> 25:19.993
Good.

25:20.754 --> 25:21.614
Triple header.

25:22.616 --> 25:27.981
Bookers and Months Club, Quality Paperback Book Club, History Book Club, they all are offering it.

25:28.282 --> 25:31.928
It's not a main selection, so I can't.

25:32.268 --> 25:34.632
It's a featured selection.

25:34.652 --> 25:36.274
Alternate selection of featured selection.

25:36.294 --> 25:36.595
UPB.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.959
Now, when does history... It's about a year after, right?

25:38.979 --> 25:43.566
Yeah, but History Book Club and Book of the Month, I know because they're offering it with the Mozart.

25:43.606 --> 25:45.909
They're offering it in the same order with the Mozart.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.071
Congratulations.

25:47.832 --> 25:48.634
So there's that.

25:48.854 --> 25:49.876
There's the Barnes & Noble.

25:49.896 --> 25:53.842
I just think there's been some good hard interest.

25:54.042 --> 25:54.643
It's good.
