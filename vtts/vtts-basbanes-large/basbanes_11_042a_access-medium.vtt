WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:04.746
A lecture in the world.

00:05.367 --> 00:06.650
We had one of them.

00:06.710 --> 00:10.458
Because I'm Mr. Bruinses, a professor of Dutch literature.

00:10.999 --> 00:13.624
He also writes a lot about books and book collectors.

00:13.665 --> 00:22.343
And he just had, there was a lecture, the Dutch antiquarian, I say, profession, perhaps you say.

00:22.323 --> 00:51.368
during the second world war so and he just it was just a few weeks ago so that's the reason i get medicine dutch so it was a lecture about uh about uh antiquarian booksellers in the netherlands and then uh what kind of people that were and then the immigrants from germany this is which were kind of yes which was another sort of uh dealers and said yes but he asked many colleagues

00:52.782 --> 01:02.095
Also the old ones, the Jewish colleagues, not many of them didn't want to talk or didn't want to have it in print because it is not... I don't know how you use the word anecdotes.

01:02.235 --> 01:04.578
In Holland you also have anecdotes.

01:05.219 --> 01:08.403
But those are funny things and I don't think there's many funny things.

01:09.064 --> 01:12.289
No, anecdotes, no, it does not mean funny.

01:12.309 --> 01:16.515
No, because you also use the word and then it must have something funnier.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.118
No, no, no, no, it means memories, it means experiences.

01:19.138 --> 01:19.819
Yes, yes, yes.

01:19.917 --> 01:48.490
okay and uh you know i talked to miguel israel for three hours last night you know he lost his brother uh yes that's nothing funny about that no no is this something i can i can take or uh yes i can ask for another copy of mr bounces yes because i have somebody who can read the dutch for me yes okay yes a fellow i used to work with yes i will try to get enough for myself because so i can take this one yes it will help a lot yeah now you are what fifth generation

01:48.470 --> 02:14.477
bookseller for generation yeah that is the painting that's my great grandfather so after him the business is made i'm so sorry my dog is never so uh you were pointing out uh

02:14.947 --> 02:16.548
Your family over here.

02:16.709 --> 02:16.969
Yes.

02:17.229 --> 02:22.394
Now, that was Loefi Goos that after him the business is named.

02:22.614 --> 02:23.935
Loefi Goos, that was Antiquiaat.

02:24.856 --> 02:28.099
Now, what part did you to go into the business?

02:28.459 --> 02:30.821
Why did you decide to become a bookseller?

02:32.002 --> 02:32.323
Why?

02:32.683 --> 02:32.923
When?

02:33.203 --> 02:34.064
Yeah.

02:34.204 --> 02:40.750
Now, after, not after school, when I started studying history hard.

02:41.871 --> 02:44.093
And during that period,

02:45.524 --> 02:50.350
First I started to work with the Bayers, it's an auction firm for books.

02:50.510 --> 02:54.516
I worked there for two years and then to the family business, yes.

02:55.337 --> 02:57.139
And then my mother was running the business.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.826
It was actually the firm of my father's family, but my father died already in 1955.

03:04.128 --> 03:05.510
So my mother continued.

03:05.850 --> 03:09.956
So there is a tradition of women working in the business in your family.

03:10.256 --> 03:10.536
Yes.

03:12.419 --> 03:13.320
Yes.

03:14.245 --> 03:16.048
Is this something you always expected?

03:16.068 --> 03:18.613
I'm curious because you are the next generation.

03:18.653 --> 03:19.855
I am interested in generational.

03:19.915 --> 03:23.641
Is this something you always expected to do?

03:24.963 --> 03:25.705
No, not at all.

03:25.845 --> 03:26.426
No, no.

03:26.466 --> 03:27.748
When I was in school, not at all.

03:27.808 --> 03:32.076
I thought I was selling medicine or something like that.

03:32.096 --> 03:32.356
No.

03:32.376 --> 03:34.039
And what kinds of, these are beautiful books.

03:34.079 --> 03:37.685
Are these books stocked that I see around me in here?

03:37.705 --> 03:38.667
Are these books...

03:39.338 --> 03:40.219
What kind of books?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.543
Are these part of your stock?

03:42.563 --> 03:43.585
This is my stock, yes.

03:43.645 --> 03:46.229
It is for sale, these books, yes.

03:46.249 --> 03:48.032
And are most of your customers in Holland?

03:48.413 --> 03:49.414
No, not at all.

03:49.434 --> 03:51.037
No, very international business.

03:52.079 --> 03:57.928
I sell perhaps 10% in the Netherlands, 20% perhaps.

03:59.310 --> 04:06.021
And I do a lot of business with America, with libraries and private persons.

04:06.288 --> 04:10.974
And also within Western Europe and Japan, yes.

04:10.994 --> 04:19.666
So would you say you have a lot of... You've continued with clients that were established by your family?

04:20.987 --> 04:28.277
Or you've developed your own... Of course, many people died and they're coming new customers, but yes.

04:28.798 --> 04:31.101
But same kinds of books you deal with?

04:31.381 --> 04:32.102
As my mother did?

04:32.202 --> 04:33.023
Or in the family did?

04:33.043 --> 04:33.544
Yes, yes.

04:34.165 --> 04:59.380
now everybody has a bit of course you have a kind of tradition and a client for that but also yes everybody has his own favorites i myself like more the good illustrated book early books and nice bindings for instance my mother was more interested in in the contents more i'm also interested in but i also

05:00.541 --> 05:05.888
like it when a good artist illustrates Princess the book.

05:05.908 --> 05:08.811
I love illustrated books too, actually.

05:09.352 --> 05:17.422
If we could just, if you could tell me, I know you were born after the war, but you certainly must know the experiences.

05:18.263 --> 05:23.409
Barney says that the fact that your mother survived is a miracle.

05:23.509 --> 05:24.270
You read the letter here.

05:24.993 --> 05:49.465
um yes not meant now i would tell so the firm was established 15 uh 1559 1859 in 59 uh start the fell time a few months because jews were not allowed to work everywhere and then after a short time we went to munich when he was about to to work there

05:50.390 --> 05:58.767
And then at some time his brothers came into the firm and one of his brothers is the grandfather of Barney.

05:58.787 --> 05:59.809
So that was the relation.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.993
But perhaps he explained that already to you.

06:02.995 --> 06:07.825
So my grandfather came into the business, Norbert Rosetta.

06:09.678 --> 06:24.113
So in the 30s, Norbert Rosenthal, my grandfather, was in the business, and his three sons, Fritz Rosenthal, that was my father, and two brothers, Ernst and Paul, two older brothers, that were twins.

06:24.133 --> 06:34.863
And now in 37, I think, 1937, Jewish businesses had to close.

06:34.903 --> 06:38.487
They came, yeah, for Walters, I don't know how you call it in English.

06:39.766 --> 06:47.500
So my parents decided to leave Germany, to fly, and went to the Netherlands, which was not fine enough, actually.

06:48.742 --> 06:55.294
And the grandparents stayed, and my grandfather died in concentration camp, Theresienstadt.

06:57.080 --> 07:17.130
um now my parents went to the netherlands and also one of the brothers power off in town the other brother i don't like the hills as i was in concentration camp and could i think with money in at the beginning before the war started you could get people free and he went to england

07:18.140 --> 07:28.509
So Paul, now my parents had to hide from the Netherlands and very many different places.

07:29.670 --> 07:33.893
And Paul was, how do you say, someone told people he is there.

07:33.953 --> 07:38.877
So he was caught and died in concentration camp.

07:38.897 --> 07:40.419
So somebody informed down there.

07:40.519 --> 07:42.360
Yes, because he could get money from that.

07:43.621 --> 07:48.045
And my mother and her mother also were caught.

07:48.717 --> 07:49.598
Your mother was five?

07:49.818 --> 07:53.563
Yes, but together with her mother, she came off to do the amendments.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.545
Your mother and grandmother?

07:54.925 --> 07:57.548
Yes, but from the other side, not from the Oshenthal side.

07:57.588 --> 08:05.699
And they were in Westerbork, as a concentration camp.

08:05.799 --> 08:17.013
And my mother lost also, first she was in jail here in The Hague, and she was pregnant and lost a child that was taken, died of, she didn't know.

08:17.033 --> 08:18.235
And...

08:20.189 --> 08:42.062
Now my mother belongs to the very few people who came back after the war from Westerbork because there were one moment there was a train strike because Westerbork was not a... from Westerbork the trains went to Auschwitz and so on to the destroying camps and so at the end of the war

08:42.667 --> 08:45.172
It was a train strike, so my mother belongs to her.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.859
I think one of the people who stayed there till the end of the war.

08:48.899 --> 08:49.660
How do you spell that?

08:49.681 --> 08:50.502
Can you spell it?

08:50.522 --> 08:51.284
Westerbork?

08:51.304 --> 08:51.384
Yes.

08:53.909 --> 08:59.720
W-E-S-T-E-R-B-O-R-K.

09:00.221 --> 09:00.321
Okay.

09:00.638 --> 09:02.220
And that's in what country?

09:02.240 --> 09:03.582
In the Netherlands, in the Netherlands.

09:03.602 --> 09:04.923
So the Germans had a camp here?

09:04.963 --> 09:05.224
Yes.

09:07.126 --> 09:07.226
Okay.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.010
And the purpose was to bring people from there to other camps.

09:10.030 --> 09:14.215
So my mother belongs to the very few, I think, only 400 people who came and returned.

09:14.996 --> 09:16.518
And my father wasn't caught.

09:16.578 --> 09:18.621
He was hiding during the war.

09:19.822 --> 09:21.184
Here, still in the Netherlands?

09:21.204 --> 09:21.905
In the Netherlands, yes.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.972
And so they had no knowledge about how the other one was?

09:27.993 --> 09:29.194
No, no, no, no.

09:31.520 --> 09:58.911
now and uh so my parents left in 37 germany and they came from walter someone you had that also in the dutch firms someone from the german states who took over the business so my parents could take i think there were three hundred thousand books or something like that they could take three yeah i read that yes and uh they could take about three thousand books to the netherlands they had three hundred thousand books yes and this was in germany in munich

09:59.667 --> 10:19.363
and they could take uh three thousand books to the Netherlands and this was in 1937 yes but yes and um so some of the books in the Netherlands also were lost of course but some returned

10:20.609 --> 10:26.694
And from the German books, in Germany, someone took over, bookseller, and sold business with those books.

10:27.275 --> 10:28.336
I have material about that.

10:29.337 --> 10:36.503
So my father, after the war, found back some of the books through the Allied forces.

10:36.843 --> 10:38.364
Really?

10:38.384 --> 10:44.790
So after several years, a lot of books came back, but of course, not at all.

10:45.471 --> 10:47.392
But they weren't all destroyed either.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.515
Yes, I think some were also in bombing.

10:51.440 --> 11:15.675
I remember my parents I just thought a few weeks ago I looked at all these procedures they had procedures for many many years just until I think 68 or something like that because they had houses and to get all this money for that and so on and it was very difficult and very emotional

11:16.499 --> 11:26.661
There was a lady in Munich, a not Jewish lady.

11:27.147 --> 11:54.083
who said after the war that she would have married the brother of my father who died in concentration camp if there had not been a war but she didn't go with Paul Rosenthal to the Netherlands and Paul Rosenthal had a fiance in the Netherlands also the niece of another bookseller but actually there was a law and she married posthumely with the brother of my father

11:54.586 --> 12:03.961
And the family should have had a year to complain about that, but of course my parents only heard about that after the year had passed.

12:03.981 --> 12:07.467
Yes, but of course it was hard to do about them for money.

12:08.208 --> 12:12.835
So there were procedures for many, I think until 68 or something like that.

12:12.855 --> 12:14.598
No problems over 20 years?

12:14.678 --> 12:15.299
Yes, yes.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.221
25 years?

12:16.241 --> 12:16.982
Yes, yes.

12:18.177 --> 12:19.518
Did she finally get something?

12:19.538 --> 12:20.499
Yeah, she got something.

12:20.960 --> 12:27.587
At least she wanted her part of everything, but finally they got a certain amount.

12:28.108 --> 12:29.309
That's terrible.

12:29.529 --> 12:36.377
Oh, yes, and my parents were very emotional about it because she didn't go with him to the Netherlands.

12:36.577 --> 12:37.778
She stayed in Germany.

12:37.898 --> 12:38.899
She stayed, sure.

12:38.919 --> 12:46.087
And he had a fiancé, but of course the procedures were in Germany, so my parents had not such a good chance.

12:46.107 --> 12:48.049
But they were the same judges as before.

12:48.417 --> 12:54.887
So I'm clear how your mother got captured and your father didn't?

12:55.648 --> 12:56.510
No, yes.

12:58.373 --> 13:03.961
My mother wanted to go to the doctor because she was pregnant and then she was caught in the street.

13:03.981 --> 13:06.846
Together with her mother, yeah.

13:06.866 --> 13:07.607
And your father?

13:08.566 --> 13:09.487
How did he find out?

13:09.507 --> 13:10.849
I guess he just didn't come home, right?

13:10.889 --> 13:11.190
Yes.

13:11.590 --> 13:12.451
I don't know exactly.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.416
I think also people who were hiding were taken.

13:15.476 --> 13:15.916
I don't know.

13:16.457 --> 13:17.879
But I can tell you all those stories.

13:17.899 --> 13:18.440
I don't know.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.541
But people did help him.

13:19.802 --> 13:21.785
There were people helping, yes.

13:21.805 --> 13:22.986
What year was she captured?

13:23.187 --> 13:24.568
Do you remember?

13:24.609 --> 13:24.829
44.

13:25.550 --> 13:26.471
So she was captured.

13:26.491 --> 13:30.397
So they were actually able to hide for four or five years, right?

13:30.417 --> 13:35.924
No, only, I think, in 42 people started to hide, I think.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.488
But I hope everything is correct because...

13:38.722 --> 13:49.738
I think my parents, because my parents came from Germany, so in Holland also people thought they were Germans, they had no state, without state, I say, without passport.

13:51.060 --> 14:02.316
First they lived in the Hague, they had to leave the Hague because they were very close to the sea, so that was, the Dutch thought it was dangerous, Germans, former Germans living here, so they went to Hilversum.

14:04.237 --> 14:06.481
So my parents belonged to the first group.

14:06.721 --> 14:14.054
We had to go to, it became a letter that they had to go to the consultation camp and then they decided to hide.

14:16.999 --> 14:20.886
And so when did they find out that they were both alive after the war?

14:20.906 --> 14:22.128
That must have been quite a reunion.

14:22.148 --> 14:24.793
Yes, I think that was or something like that, yes.

14:25.972 --> 14:29.758
Because my mother was freed earlier than my father here.

14:29.798 --> 14:37.309
That was in Drenthe, that's a province where the Allied forces came earlier.

14:37.329 --> 14:39.432
And she survived.

14:39.452 --> 14:39.732
Yes.

14:39.973 --> 14:41.795
And you said one of four hundred from that.

14:41.916 --> 14:42.877
I think so, yes.

14:42.957 --> 14:43.818
A very small number.

14:44.099 --> 14:46.242
A very small number, yes.

14:46.322 --> 14:49.186
Most people have been to Auschwitz and Bacher and so on.

14:49.286 --> 14:52.792
So that is kind of a, that is miraculous.

14:52.812 --> 14:53.172
Yes, yes.

14:53.713 --> 14:55.776
But all the youth who survived

14:56.600 --> 14:59.763
So I think that I can use weight, perhaps, yes.

14:59.863 --> 15:00.764
And you were born when?

15:01.165 --> 15:01.625
What year?

15:01.745 --> 15:02.306
Forty-eight.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.527
Forty-eight.

15:03.547 --> 15:07.171
So I only can tell you from the stories I work, so I hope it's quite.

15:10.575 --> 15:12.657
And when did you enter the business?

15:16.161 --> 15:19.304
Okay, well, 74, I think.

15:19.324 --> 15:21.086
Yeah, so actually quite some time.

15:21.106 --> 15:21.426
Yes.

15:22.857 --> 15:39.060
So you were a young woman now, but I mean, you were younger than I. You certainly decided at an early age that you wanted to... No, then I worked together with my mother.

15:40.282 --> 15:42.285
So what kinds of things did your mother teach you?

15:42.325 --> 15:44.168
Was your mother a good book woman?

15:44.929 --> 15:47.132
Did she do catalogues and stuff like that?

15:47.232 --> 15:51.919
Yes, and I can show you also the catalogues just recently were made here.

15:52.608 --> 16:01.082
For my mother it was more, the business was more something, my father died from a wrong injection from my doctor

16:01.990 --> 16:26.867
after one of those trips to Germany and he had a pain in his back and the doctor came and within 20 minutes he died and she promised my father to go on with the business because for her that was the only thing in her life actually yes I think that Jewish business which had to go on or so which survives with the war something like that

16:27.944 --> 16:29.265
So that was very important.

16:29.526 --> 16:33.770
It was less important how the business was going or something like that.

16:34.170 --> 16:36.373
So your father basically died a healthy man.

16:37.013 --> 16:37.294
Yes.

16:38.195 --> 16:42.820
So there was no indication that... No, he was very young.

16:43.020 --> 16:43.881
He was 46.

16:44.521 --> 16:46.684
There was nothing to prepare your mother for?

16:46.904 --> 16:47.805
No, no.

16:47.825 --> 16:50.087
And so did she know a lot about the business?

16:50.107 --> 16:56.213
Yes, because she worked already before she was married in the business, in Munich, yes.

16:56.233 --> 16:57.715
So do you think...

16:59.062 --> 17:03.974
This is quite a very prestigious name.

17:03.994 --> 17:07.803
I mean, Rosenthal has a very great name in the bookseller.

17:08.525 --> 17:10.410
It's now for 140 years, right?

17:10.450 --> 17:13.437
Yes, really.

17:13.678 --> 17:16.986
And then you have family members that...

17:17.303 --> 17:25.391
Barney, and you have an uncle in England, yes.

17:25.551 --> 17:32.298
What is it that, you know, Barney talks about the European tradition in bookselling, the knowing the books.

17:34.100 --> 17:37.504
It's more than just being the person who sells books.

17:37.544 --> 17:41.147
I think there's a deeper element involved.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.789
Wouldn't you agree with that?

17:42.809 --> 17:45.572
Well, that varies from dealer to dealer.

17:46.852 --> 17:50.595
I'm sure you know every book that's here.

17:50.615 --> 17:52.537
I'm sure you know it.

17:52.557 --> 18:03.386
You make descriptions of the books and try to know your books, but of course there are also book dealers who just could sell something else.

18:03.427 --> 18:05.829
That's right, they buy something and they try to sell it.

18:05.849 --> 18:10.433
Do you buy for stock or do you buy for customers generally speaking?

18:10.493 --> 18:13.976
No, for stock, but of course you keep in mind which customers you have.

18:13.996 --> 18:16.538
No, but I just buy what I like myself.

18:16.973 --> 18:23.139
And do you generally get from other dealers or auction or private?

18:23.339 --> 18:28.884
Yes, all of them, yeah, yeah.

18:28.904 --> 18:35.370
You said earlier that it was kind of a, you said they came to Holland but they didn't go far enough.

18:35.390 --> 18:39.554
Do you think that maybe they should have gone maybe to the United States?

18:39.794 --> 18:41.776
Yeah, of course, yes.

18:43.537 --> 18:46.440
I don't know.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.853
Yes.

18:47.873 --> 18:49.335
After, as you can say, it was not far enough.

18:49.636 --> 18:52.339
But I don't know if I tried to go to America.

18:52.359 --> 18:53.060
I never heard that.

18:53.741 --> 18:54.963
But you couldn't go everywhere.

18:55.003 --> 19:04.635
For instance, Nico Israel could go to Switzerland, but many people couldn't go there because... And also, my parents only... My mother had a cousin.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.798
He was also a bookseller.

19:06.818 --> 19:11.364
He went to the Netherlands in 1933, and then you could go everywhere.

19:11.464 --> 19:12.546
Or he could go to the Netherlands.

19:12.626 --> 19:16.731
And he had to... How do you say it in English?

19:18.449 --> 19:37.099
my parents only could go to the netherlands because he said he guaranteed for my parents about the money you know because otherwise i couldn't have come to the netherlands this is who guaranteed this i'm sorry a cousin of my mother who was living already he came to in 33 to the netherlands he was also an antiquarian bookseller

19:37.720 --> 19:45.110
And he guaranteed that my people, my parents wouldn't ask the state for money if they had more troubles.

19:45.991 --> 19:46.992
He would guarantee for them.

19:47.013 --> 19:50.537
And that was the reason they could enter the Netherlands, to stay here.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.863
And how soon after the war were they able to restart the business again?

19:56.425 --> 19:58.508
I think rather soon, yes.

19:59.169 --> 20:04.596
But it took several years before the books came back.

20:05.397 --> 20:07.440
The big stop, yes.

20:08.062 --> 20:12.049
And they decided to stay here instead of go back to Germany and go someplace else?

20:12.189 --> 20:14.794
Yes, of course, yes.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.900
So, they're happy being Dutch?

20:18.020 --> 20:19.523
Are you happy with...?

20:19.743 --> 20:23.450
Yes, I think so, because it's not good for Jews to live in Germany, yeah.

20:23.650 --> 20:23.991
I see.

20:24.011 --> 20:26.675
Well, I think, yeah.

20:26.695 --> 20:28.118
Anything else that you think...?

20:28.318 --> 20:31.504
I told you we wouldn't have to spend too much time on this.

20:32.142 --> 20:36.767
Because I am trying to get as balanced as a picture, and it is so hard to talk to these people.

20:37.087 --> 20:37.408
Yes.

20:38.129 --> 20:39.450
Very few of them even are alive.

20:39.470 --> 20:46.578
Yes, of course, all the colleagues, but they are very nervous also to talk about all those things, what happens here and so on.

20:47.399 --> 20:49.060
Did your parents talk much about it?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.102
Probably not, right?

20:50.122 --> 20:55.528
No, my father, I was seven when my father died, and so my mother talked about it, yes.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.474
But, for instance, in that lecture are things I didn't know.

21:01.775 --> 21:02.095
Really?

21:02.115 --> 21:03.157
Also about our firm.

21:03.878 --> 21:04.519
About your firm?

21:04.779 --> 21:05.500
Also, yes.

21:05.520 --> 21:11.788
Because Mr. Bramsters went to the Rijksinstituut for Ordersdokumentatie.

21:11.808 --> 21:14.712
It is an institute for war documentation.

21:15.373 --> 21:18.958
And there he found also things about our firm.

21:19.138 --> 21:20.700
But like what in particular was the firm?

21:20.720 --> 21:28.070
No, about the name of Verwalter, the man in the Netherlands who got into charge of the firm.

21:29.692 --> 21:30.313
And...

21:33.112 --> 21:37.238
what their estimation was of the value of the firm, for instance.

21:37.258 --> 21:37.638
That's it.

21:37.658 --> 21:38.680
Yeah, he found it, yes.

21:40.583 --> 21:41.784
That's good.

21:41.965 --> 21:45.610
So a lot of the questions I might have are probably right in here, do you think?

21:46.170 --> 21:53.601
Yes, but it's not complete because many colleagues didn't want to talk, or said we talked to Mr. Beimsters, but perhaps you should talk to him.

21:56.225 --> 22:00.030
This lecture is about the Dutch antiquarian booksellers,

22:00.517 --> 22:29.595
before the war most of them were jewish people and were very simple so they also dealt in vegetables and so on and were standing on markets and didn't know much about their books and then came the emigrants from germany that were also another kind of many of them learned people so after the war the antiquarian book table had a higher level

22:31.195 --> 22:32.177
That's excellent.

22:32.337 --> 22:35.301
Like I said, I really don't have a whole lot to... No.

22:36.764 --> 22:40.549
I did want to get the story of your parents.

22:41.270 --> 22:46.178
And did your mother ever talk much about life in the concentration camp?

22:46.759 --> 22:50.404
No, she told some things, but not so much, no.

22:50.685 --> 22:51.767
And she lost a child?

22:51.887 --> 22:52.708
Yes, yes.

22:52.848 --> 22:54.751
And do you have any other siblings?

22:55.332 --> 22:56.153
You're the only child?

22:56.334 --> 22:57.716
No, I'm the only child, yes.

22:58.557 --> 22:58.637
Yes.

22:59.225 --> 23:03.911
So do you think, are you hoping we'll be a fifth generation in the book business?

23:03.931 --> 23:04.532
I have children.

23:04.612 --> 23:05.913
No, not in the books.

23:06.194 --> 23:06.915
I don't think so.

23:07.615 --> 23:12.061
One of my sons is studying chemistry and the other is becoming an engineer, so I don't think so.

23:13.463 --> 23:15.725
So what happens to the firm, do you think?

23:15.806 --> 23:18.148
I don't know.

23:18.168 --> 23:18.809
But you love it.

23:18.829 --> 23:20.732
You still very much enjoy it.

23:20.972 --> 23:22.294
Yes, so we'll see.

23:22.314 --> 23:22.794
I don't know.

23:23.015 --> 23:25.538
Do you collect books yourself at all?

23:26.198 --> 23:27.460
Sometimes.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.207
No, not really.

23:29.227 --> 23:34.194
I have a few Hebrew books.

23:34.474 --> 23:35.476
That's very interesting.

23:35.996 --> 23:38.920
Judaica or... No, those in Hebrew.

23:38.940 --> 23:50.015
Yes, for instance, because you ask if I do the same things as my mother, so now and then I deal with Hebrew books.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.178
So you really learned the business from your mother, obviously.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.199
You were seven years old.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.942
Yes, yes.

23:54.962 --> 23:55.843
Was there anyone else?

23:55.992 --> 24:13.039
helped you learn the business yeah we always had people working for us yes this is very interesting a woman i can't think of any other case where a woman succeeds a woman in the business this is a very unusual can you think of another case yeah think about it

24:14.082 --> 24:14.643
I don't know.

24:14.903 --> 24:18.448
Because it's women and it's not common to see many women.

24:18.929 --> 24:19.910
No, in Holland not.

24:20.010 --> 24:22.353
Perhaps in America more women are working.

24:23.335 --> 24:26.339
Yes, but how many are succeeded by women?

24:26.419 --> 24:26.619
No.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.886
So what did your mother teach you that's most valuable about books?

24:34.570 --> 24:35.832
Obviously a sense of tradition.

24:36.252 --> 24:39.196
Yes, of course I worked two years with Bayer.

24:39.236 --> 24:43.482
So the first things I learned there, how to collate a book and so on, yes.

24:44.812 --> 24:59.284
no yeah she is very interested or was interested in incutables and this is 15th century printed books and 16th century books so I learned a lot about those books yes are you still able to find incutables?

24:59.324 --> 25:08.932
yes yes you see all those online incutables where do you find them these days private homes?

25:09.513 --> 25:14.397
no not so much no of course there are sometimes collections which are sold again but

25:15.338 --> 25:20.926
Not in the ceiling, how are you saying?

25:20.946 --> 25:21.426
No, no.

25:21.446 --> 25:23.449
Yeah.

25:23.469 --> 25:23.569
Okay.

25:23.589 --> 25:27.014
Like I said, I didn't think that we had a lot.

25:27.114 --> 25:32.922
I really am interested in, you know, because I can't talk to your mother.

25:33.162 --> 25:33.703
No, no.

25:33.723 --> 25:35.726
She's very childish, how are you saying?

25:35.746 --> 25:36.146
I understand.

25:36.507 --> 25:36.827
Yes.

25:37.068 --> 25:41.694
So I'm happy then to get a secondhand story where I can.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.438
I talked to, you know, Lucien Goldschmidt for instance.

25:44.538 --> 25:44.738
Yeah.

25:44.853 --> 26:03.047
I talked to his wife, Marguerite, and she was very helpful, and there was another woman, whose name escapes me right now, another woman in New York, whose husband also was a book star.

26:03.179 --> 26:31.583
here a little by little yes not of course if you talk to max and nico israel but max israel also won't have told you too much hey he's also he doesn't want to speak about it i think yeah he gave me some pre-spects he was with a with a forest in the forest with a man yeah he talked about it a little bit nico talked for us yes but he was in switzerland he was he had not such a horrible part yes a little easier in switzerland not easier but but less dangerous shall we say yes

26:32.018 --> 26:33.760
It wasn't easy for anyone.

26:33.780 --> 26:39.146
Of course, in Holland, Mr. Emmering, but he's also 83.

26:40.127 --> 26:50.900
All those people lost their stocks because there came those men who took charge and then other Dutch dealers bought those stocks and they had nothing.

26:51.861 --> 27:01.452
Do you agree with Barney and others who say that, you know, I guess with the loss of all these booksellers from Germany,

27:01.837 --> 27:06.122
The book trade in Germany, it's just now beginning to recover.

27:06.183 --> 27:08.626
Do you agree with that?

27:09.387 --> 27:10.849
I don't know who it was before the war.

27:10.949 --> 27:13.852
I think the book sell, I think, in Germany.

27:15.234 --> 27:15.514
Yes.

27:17.737 --> 27:23.725
And, which I perhaps shouldn't say, but a few of them were very rich after the war.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.667
It wasn't.

27:27.970 --> 27:30.814
They learned about the war.

27:31.672 --> 27:32.994
I think so.

27:33.014 --> 27:33.094
Yes.

27:33.114 --> 27:34.616
But you said the stock was 300,000?

27:35.397 --> 27:41.585
Yes, because I just... Now, it has been millions of books before, I think, 1900s.

27:41.946 --> 27:48.274
But I just found that in one of the... Introductions to a Catalogue.

27:48.294 --> 27:51.058
I found that in the 20s or something like that.

27:51.558 --> 27:53.882
And Barney wrote quite a bit about that.

27:54.042 --> 27:57.627
Also, not Barney, but there's an article that was published by Harvard University.

27:57.647 --> 28:00.210
It gives a very good background of the...

28:00.646 --> 28:01.647
the family business.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.009
So I've got a lot of background.

28:03.029 --> 28:03.549
Yes, yes.

28:03.569 --> 28:04.690
So I really don't have to cover it.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.512
No, but he is, of course, of the other.

28:07.013 --> 28:09.435
He is the senator of the Jacques Frouche Tower.

28:10.076 --> 28:12.118
And his parents, my parents did better.

28:12.138 --> 28:16.383
He also went in 1933 to Switzerland and to America.

28:16.943 --> 28:18.725
So my family did not so good for him.

28:18.745 --> 28:18.905
Yeah.

28:21.028 --> 28:23.250
Well, I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

28:23.270 --> 28:26.994
I do get back things they have and so on.

28:27.374 --> 28:27.615
Yeah.

28:28.616 --> 28:29.877
And also because

28:30.532 --> 28:33.656
One very expensive book.

28:34.277 --> 28:41.227
My parents gave it to... Yes, but I don't know if you have to say something about it.

28:42.849 --> 28:48.077
But when it became dangerous, my parents gave one very expensive book to someone in Germany.

28:48.097 --> 28:56.809
I don't have the documents about it, but he sold it to the Bayes' Staatsbibutake in Munich.

28:57.498 --> 29:09.422
And I just saw a few weeks ago in the Royal Library in Hague that they have an exhibition catalogue that said from 1940 that they just bought that book.

29:11.246 --> 29:16.637
And I know from many catalogues that my parents possess that book, only the fact that they gave it

29:17.140 --> 29:21.185
to hide it to someone and that he sold it.

29:21.285 --> 29:22.506
I have no documents about it.

29:22.586 --> 29:43.250
And I just started to think about if I can do something about it because there was never and my parents never tried to do something about that book because it was a difficult thing to prove but now every day and because of the Swiss banks have to give money back now and so on perhaps I will do something about it.

29:43.370 --> 29:44.211
Well I won't mention names

29:44.950 --> 29:56.114
because I don't want to get in trouble either, but what you're saying in a very general way is that your parents turned a book over to a German bookseller for safekeeping?

29:56.414 --> 29:59.200
Yes, to a private person, yes, to safekeeping.

29:59.341 --> 30:05.153
A private person, and my mother always, but that I only know from what she told me.

30:05.656 --> 30:21.371
He sold it in 1940 to the Bayerische Staatsbeutek and that I can prove because there's an exhibition catalogue in that the library writes that you just could buy that book.

30:21.692 --> 30:23.493
Oh and it says who they bought it from too?

30:23.594 --> 30:23.754
No.

30:23.834 --> 30:24.414
No, no.

30:24.434 --> 30:25.676
But what was the name of the library?

30:26.176 --> 30:27.457
Bayerische Staatsbeutek.

30:27.878 --> 30:29.259
Which is that?

30:29.279 --> 30:31.121
Yes, I don't know if you write it.

30:31.141 --> 30:32.963
That is the main library.

30:32.983 --> 30:33.723
In German?

30:33.784 --> 30:35.325
Bayerische BA.

30:35.609 --> 30:53.955
Do you remember the name of the book?

30:54.536 --> 30:54.776
Yes.

30:55.237 --> 30:57.280
Maybe you could write that down too.

30:57.698 --> 30:58.599
Next page.

30:58.619 --> 31:05.127
Yes, but I don't know if you want to... because I perhaps want to do something about what could... Don't worry.

31:05.247 --> 31:05.987
We have lawyers.

31:06.068 --> 31:07.950
I don't do anything without... Yes.

31:09.832 --> 31:20.264
During my parents' book, or my grandfather, at the end of the last century, must have been for a lot of money because it is in catalogs of 1900 and 1920s.

31:20.304 --> 31:24.769
He couldn't sell it for 300,000 during March, which was a very lot of money.

31:25.424 --> 31:30.710
Because they thought it was the first printed book, printed before the Gutenberg Bible.

31:32.111 --> 31:36.736
No, Gutenberg Bible was the first... Yes, but then they assumed that that book was earlier.

31:37.397 --> 31:38.678
So... This book here?

31:38.718 --> 31:38.938
Yes.

31:39.499 --> 31:46.526
So there are many books about these books, and many books are published about... And how many copies are in existence?

31:46.546 --> 31:52.933
Now then they knew only about this copy, but now a few other copies know.

31:54.027 --> 32:02.117
But now some scientists think this is a bit later, this book made it a bit later, but still discussion about it because it is undated.

32:02.737 --> 32:04.219
Where was it printed in mines?

32:04.239 --> 32:05.440
I will show you.

32:05.981 --> 32:17.955
Okay, I'd love to see it.

32:18.135 --> 32:22.060
We don't know, this is from the computer now, this is everything.

32:22.343 --> 32:27.589
Missale Fischale, the first thought that was printed in Mainz, now perhaps I think it is Basel, okay.

32:27.609 --> 32:29.230
It is sort of a difficult thing.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.272
1473.

32:31.253 --> 32:33.555
Yes, and the first thought is earlier.

32:33.915 --> 32:39.421
So it is a difficult thing, but there are just very few copies.

32:41.564 --> 32:43.286
And we think Meister is the printer?

32:43.426 --> 32:44.127
Yes, perhaps.

32:46.369 --> 32:47.630
Could I get a Xerox of this?

32:47.650 --> 32:49.212
Yeah, I think, yes.

32:49.698 --> 32:56.207
Yes, I don't know, because, yeah, of course you can, this is public information.

32:56.267 --> 32:57.409
Yeah, don't worry about it.

32:57.469 --> 33:01.815
There are only a few copies, and now you have heard of Karls, you know?

33:01.895 --> 33:02.356
Of course.

33:02.376 --> 33:14.052
Yes, so he made a catalogue when he was 50 years in the book business, of most important books he sold during his life.

33:14.588 --> 33:19.174
And he starts with another copy of this book, and it's number one.

33:19.374 --> 33:19.734
Number one.

33:19.774 --> 33:27.003
When he saw this copy, he saw the first printed book, you know?

33:27.143 --> 33:28.805
Afterwards, there was a discussion.

33:29.085 --> 33:30.707
And the Pierpont Morgan book.

33:30.727 --> 33:31.228
Yeah, yes.

33:31.869 --> 33:42.081
So I heard the librarian of the Pierpont Morgan always, Mr. Bühler, always was...

33:42.989 --> 33:47.035
I'm sure that it was early.

33:47.555 --> 33:49.138
See, I can get this out of here.

33:49.158 --> 33:55.927
Okay, but I don't think you should... Well, what I would like to suggest... Perhaps I will try to.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.810
And I can't prove, you know.

33:58.731 --> 34:03.478
But let me just ask you some questions, and then you'll see how I...

34:04.673 --> 34:08.337
You understand that before the war your parents had a copy of this book?

34:08.497 --> 34:09.278
I'm sure.

34:09.298 --> 34:09.579
Okay.

34:09.879 --> 34:15.606
And I know because I went to the library and I know my great-grandparents.

34:16.487 --> 34:23.415
I know in several catalogs, for instance in 1928, I know they still had it.

34:23.615 --> 34:29.702
And I also got a notice in 1898 they had it.

34:30.205 --> 34:32.108
So this was in the family for many years.

34:32.568 --> 34:32.688
Yes.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.292
But if you couldn't sell it, I think it was different, yes.

34:36.373 --> 34:41.340
But, yes, in 1925, they asked 300,000 marks and also... 1925.

34:41.460 --> 34:45.065
Yes, and also at the beginning of the 20th century already.

34:46.066 --> 34:46.166
300.

34:46.186 --> 34:47.909
See, this is factual.

34:48.610 --> 34:49.431
That is factual.

34:49.451 --> 34:49.631
Yes.

34:49.651 --> 34:50.372
I can show you.

34:50.492 --> 34:52.815
And do you know which catalog, what number it was?

34:52.835 --> 34:58.643
Yes, for instance, in catalog 164 from 1925, which is there,

34:59.062 --> 35:20.277
on the number 104 that i know well okay so this is factual that is fact and so when they had to leave germany you were yes but i can't prove that my parents didn't sell it to the man and that he was not allowed to sell it himself so that is that is what i perhaps will try to do something about

35:20.898 --> 35:23.861
But it is difficult.

35:23.961 --> 35:24.802
It's quite difficult.

35:24.962 --> 35:30.008
But when you said that they were allowed to bring 3,000 books, why wouldn't they have brought that one, do you think?

35:30.568 --> 35:33.071
Yes, but I think they gave it already earlier to that man.

35:33.531 --> 35:33.852
I see.

35:34.172 --> 35:34.752
I see.

35:34.773 --> 35:35.994
And this was for safekeeping?

35:36.294 --> 35:36.574
Yes.

35:36.755 --> 35:37.996
That's what my mother told me.

35:38.016 --> 35:40.098
But I have, of course, no records about it.

35:40.258 --> 35:41.700
I only now have those catalogs.

35:41.820 --> 35:44.423
And I know that in 1940 it was in the library.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.467
Anyway, it still is in the library.

35:48.487 --> 35:49.588
In 1940 it was in?

35:49.687 --> 35:51.550
In that library I wrote you down.

35:51.710 --> 35:52.511
Yes, okay.

35:54.514 --> 36:03.046
It was a Gutenberg anniversary exhibition in Munich in 1940 and it was in there with a note that could acquire that copy.

36:04.648 --> 36:14.682
And it was the copy of Rosenthal because there is a lot of publications about this book because they thought it was so spectacular now, you know, so there are many many books written about that book.

36:15.843 --> 36:43.740
this is a very interesting story but of course perhaps a few months ago or perhaps because of all those publications perhaps I can do something about it because I know my mother was angry about it but it would not have made sense five years ago to do something because you will lose this case because you can't prove everything

36:44.142 --> 36:46.324
Is that person dead?

36:46.384 --> 36:48.006
Oh yes, yes, a long time ago.

36:48.026 --> 36:49.327
Well, he's dead, so what's his name?

36:49.948 --> 36:51.209
No, I don't tell you.

36:51.249 --> 36:53.932
Okay, okay.

36:54.012 --> 36:59.778
But my husband, he is a lawyer, and he thought perhaps you could do something about it.

36:59.858 --> 37:01.480
I don't know, I talked to several people.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.901
I don't know if I could do something.

37:04.143 --> 37:09.969
It's not the money, it's the fact that... Perhaps it is also the money.

37:09.989 --> 37:13.272
I don't want to look back, but no, yes, no, yeah, but this...

37:15.614 --> 37:17.016
Perhaps it is also the money.

37:17.136 --> 37:19.459
Yes, and the idea, yes.

37:20.220 --> 37:22.924
Yes.

37:22.944 --> 37:27.070
But perhaps it goes very emotionally.

37:27.230 --> 37:32.638
It costs only money for lawyers and so on, and it doesn't make any sense that I do nothing.

37:32.678 --> 37:36.343
But you see, I was just thinking about it or something.

37:37.044 --> 37:43.393
Because of all the other things, there were lawsuits and fighting, but about this nothing was done.

37:43.795 --> 38:05.567
you know and the fact is this was in your family for a long time yes yes and of course it is not worth so much anymore because it is not so special as they thought but still it's very interesting it's not unique but it's not unique and it's later later so uh but it's still very important

38:08.112 --> 38:14.679
I'll hand, whatever I do with this, I have your fax, I have your email, we can talk.

38:14.759 --> 38:14.999
Yes.

38:17.762 --> 38:24.268
But I didn't try to, I didn't talk to the Barista's take about this, I did nothing.

38:24.749 --> 38:27.231
So now, just ask several people.

38:27.251 --> 38:34.098
Well, I could certainly ask them how they acquired it, as a journalist asking a question.

38:34.539 --> 38:37.101
Yes, yes, you can.

38:37.121 --> 38:37.782
No problem.

38:38.217 --> 38:48.934
You know, there was also a man who... He said it's very funny, let's see if I can find it.

38:52.038 --> 38:58.989
There was Mr. Alan Stephenson, and he wrote in 67, the pattern of the Missale Speciale.

39:02.635 --> 39:03.536
And what did he say?

39:03.556 --> 39:04.798
Oh yeah, he's...

39:06.618 --> 39:10.523
It was funny how he could cost perhaps Ian for it, but he died.

39:13.446 --> 39:14.267
And here's the character.

39:16.670 --> 39:20.775
He said, the first excellent copy was discovered in Munich and the rest remained in that city.

39:20.875 --> 39:26.682
Unterhub came upon it at the Friedrich Reum bookstore about 1880 and purchased it for Pippens.

39:27.122 --> 39:28.544
He's talking about your family now.

39:28.764 --> 39:31.548
No, but Unterhub found a book.

39:31.568 --> 39:33.570
Someone else who sold it to our firm.

39:34.107 --> 39:38.113
He placed it in the hands of the Luther Rolfenthal Antiquariate in 1896.

39:38.754 --> 39:45.725
It ventured as far as the British Museum in 1899, but year after year remained unsewed.

39:46.225 --> 39:50.772
So it was offered to the people of Morgan in 1906 for 300,000.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.194
In 1906?

39:52.295 --> 39:53.216
Wolfmarks, yes.

39:53.316 --> 39:57.162
He known more than I know also.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.020
And it was even sent across a planting on a pole pole.

40:00.140 --> 40:06.431
And ultimately, and that's funny how he says, ultimately it was absorbed into the great British task you take.

40:06.651 --> 40:07.673
Absorbed, he says.

40:08.334 --> 40:11.760
Perhaps he knew more about it, but he also wanted to come ask him.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.381
And who is he?

40:14.304 --> 40:21.276
Mr. Alan Stephenson, he wrote in 67 a book about that book, The Problem of the Missale Speciale.

40:21.712 --> 40:26.299
I think tonight, ultimately, it was absorbed into the grave by the stars.

40:26.319 --> 40:28.081
There was a book, there was the title of that book?

40:28.322 --> 40:31.026
The problem of the... Yes, his, yes.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.290
So that you'll find it in every library.

40:34.310 --> 40:36.373
And it's S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N?

40:36.674 --> 40:39.858
S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N, yes.

40:40.199 --> 40:40.920
How is it?

40:41.220 --> 40:42.683
A-L-L-E-N or A-L-A-N?

40:42.703 --> 40:43.724
A-L-L-A-N.

40:44.806 --> 40:45.847
Alan Stevenson.

40:46.768 --> 40:49.913
So I did some research, I don't have that book, but...

40:51.327 --> 40:59.356
So he knew that this copy was sent to Priebant-Norvin and he bought another copy of Mr. Krause later.

40:59.376 --> 41:03.341
The copy which is... You see, this is one of the stories, we're talking about books.

41:04.542 --> 41:13.572
To add insult to injury, I mean, they took the book and... Yes, but as I can't prove it...

41:13.990 --> 41:20.836
It's difficult, so, before you write... No, no, don't worry about it, but did your father try and get it back after the war?

41:20.856 --> 41:24.219
I don't know, I was seven, I don't know, I don't know.

41:24.239 --> 41:31.246
But my mother told me about it, and she was already in the firm, from Sir de Vriand or something like that.

41:31.266 --> 41:42.456
I wonder if they approached the man after the war and said... No, I don't think so, because they had so many such... dachets, how do you say it?

41:42.536 --> 41:42.816
Dachets.

41:43.150 --> 41:45.072
about all those procedures.

41:45.112 --> 41:47.035
They got crazy about that, of course.

41:47.816 --> 41:58.169
So this was difficult, but now you have more cases like that in Holland as well, and they try to get things back from Donchett's home and paintings and so on.

41:58.910 --> 42:09.904
And now people can't say so easily anymore, perhaps, well, okay, if it's finished and you don't have... There's a case going on right now about some paintings.

42:09.924 --> 42:10.204
Yes.

42:10.758 --> 42:12.180
It's a big, big, big case.

42:12.200 --> 42:12.761
Yes, yes.

42:12.921 --> 42:17.988
It's all difficult stories, but now people have to discuss and listen.

42:18.068 --> 42:23.215
There's a story in the New York Times, if I can find it, I'll send it to you, about paintings, but it's the same kind of a thing.

42:23.235 --> 42:23.836
Yes, yes.

42:23.856 --> 42:24.877
Everywhere in the world now.

42:25.678 --> 42:28.022
And it looks to me like they've got a pretty good claim.

42:28.282 --> 42:28.502
Yes.

42:28.522 --> 42:29.884
Because there's codes in the book.

42:30.465 --> 42:30.685
Yes.

42:30.705 --> 42:32.167
You can prove that you had that book.

42:32.187 --> 42:38.436
Yes, but for instance, they gave it to someone, the paintings, and he sold it to Germans or such a difficult thing.

42:39.108 --> 42:44.195
But then he says, well, I've got a bill, I sold it, I bought it from him, but I don't have a bill of saving.

42:44.215 --> 42:44.476
Yes.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.537
Do you have a receipt?

42:46.238 --> 42:47.901
No, of course you don't have.

42:48.121 --> 42:49.363
Everything is lost.

42:49.383 --> 42:50.164
Everything is lost.

42:50.364 --> 42:50.985
Yes.

42:51.005 --> 42:58.817
We don't have our, how do you say, documentations anymore, nothing, no.

42:59.618 --> 43:00.960
I'll be very cautious with this.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.543
Yes, because perhaps I do something about it.

43:03.644 --> 43:04.084
Yes.

43:04.104 --> 43:08.130
We probably did it right in 49, so already.

43:08.150 --> 43:08.811
Yes.

43:09.770 --> 43:13.096
Then I think... Silas makes it so hard.

43:13.416 --> 43:13.657
Yes.

43:15.119 --> 43:16.642
Because who would you recover from?

43:17.103 --> 43:17.583
He's dead.

43:17.603 --> 43:18.405
Yes, yes.

43:18.645 --> 43:21.169
And if the boy starts, will you take date for it?

43:22.472 --> 43:30.045
But they knew, they knew that it was, had been for my parents because, or from the firm, because there were so many publications.

43:30.065 --> 43:32.048
They always talk about the Rosenthal copy.

43:32.703 --> 43:38.091
That they don't... So that is a difficult point, so... Museums are horrible on this.

43:38.111 --> 43:40.395
They look the other way, as long as they don't know.

43:40.415 --> 43:42.698
No, it was war, it was war, so... This is war.

43:42.838 --> 43:46.264
And people died in concentration camps, so, yeah.

43:47.085 --> 44:00.465
But, for instance, there's another story, I don't know, but we have two big German auctions, and you're often invited to auction dinners during such auctions,

44:00.985 --> 44:09.101
Once I was sitting next to the wife of one of the important German antiquarian book centers.

44:10.423 --> 44:18.339
And she told me the whole evening what they were processing, you know, about how many extra houses they have got and books and everything.

44:18.479 --> 44:23.128
And in Holland you have a tradition, you don't show off, people don't.

44:23.513 --> 44:31.663
don't have expensive jewellery, you don't show off, you always complain about what you don't have, that you don't have money or something.

44:33.005 --> 44:47.242
So that's all right, not a tradition in Holland, but that was enormous the whole night, she told me, and then I told my mother, and she said, oh, they became so rich during the war, you know.

44:47.262 --> 44:52.288
So, yeah, they have all the important books in the world, they have got,

44:53.095 --> 45:07.450
Of course, these books were there to be... Yeah, for nothing, or just taken, or I don't know, of course I don't know the exact story, but... Well, these, uh, smoke these fires, they say.

45:07.470 --> 45:09.172
Yes, yes, yes.

45:09.192 --> 45:11.474
And, of course, that's one book that you lost, imagine.

45:11.494 --> 45:12.335
That's one out of three.

45:12.355 --> 45:17.581
They lost many, many, many books, of course, but that is the only book my mother told me often about.

45:18.021 --> 45:19.643
And she kept...

45:19.943 --> 45:23.046
There was some news about it, he kept it because, yes.

45:23.967 --> 45:25.969
And of course this is a person they must have trusted?

45:26.489 --> 45:26.730
Yes.

45:27.190 --> 45:28.612
Was he an employee of your father?

45:28.632 --> 45:30.613
No, no, no.

45:30.633 --> 45:31.274
Or just a friend?

45:32.575 --> 45:38.802
The person who found the book also and sold it to the firm, yes.

45:38.822 --> 45:39.242
I understand.

45:39.262 --> 45:39.863
I think.

45:39.883 --> 45:40.223
Now what?

45:40.243 --> 45:49.512
Now someone discovered that book, bought it and sold it to my parents and then they, and he published also a lot of books about that book and then they gave it to him

45:50.065 --> 45:54.409
He was the person who saw it, so they gave it to him.

45:54.469 --> 45:56.271
He knew better than anybody what it was.

45:56.311 --> 46:00.055
He knew what it was, yes.

46:00.375 --> 46:04.159
I see now.

46:04.179 --> 46:08.763
Was he a youngish man or an older man, I wonder, at that time?

46:08.803 --> 46:09.464
Neither, yes.

46:12.147 --> 46:13.108
When I was born in 1859.

46:13.248 --> 46:15.770
He was this man?

46:15.810 --> 46:16.191
Yes.

46:16.211 --> 46:18.553
If it is this man, if you know that, I think...

46:19.613 --> 46:20.996
I can't ask my mother anymore.

46:21.196 --> 46:22.118
No, I understand.

46:22.138 --> 46:23.681
That's going to make it very difficult.

46:23.701 --> 46:33.238
So difficult, and also that I don't want that you... If I get some more facts, you know, I can tell you, but at this moment it is difficult.

46:34.380 --> 46:39.229
I would not name any names anyway, so I would not identify anybody.

46:39.670 --> 46:41.233
But it's a fact that you had the book.

46:41.382 --> 46:43.986
It's a fact that you don't have the book now.

46:44.106 --> 46:45.108
They never have the money.

46:45.128 --> 46:46.791
My parents are never the money.

46:47.271 --> 46:49.735
The fact is in that library.

46:49.775 --> 46:50.556
That is a fact.

46:50.637 --> 46:54.242
And it's a fact that they had to flee Germany and leave their books behind.

46:54.342 --> 46:56.306
These are facts.

46:56.526 --> 47:06.141
The business was not closed yet when my parents fled and my great-grandfather stayed and died in Theresienstadt.

47:06.492 --> 47:09.577
I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not putting a case in court.

47:09.637 --> 47:12.120
I'm just writing stories, and you've persuaded me.

47:12.902 --> 47:16.086
And, you know, I'm writing my story.

47:16.267 --> 47:22.055
You understand what I'm saying?

47:22.336 --> 47:23.738
You talked to Roland about this.

47:23.918 --> 47:26.522
Because I'm going to see Anne-Marie and Roland in a couple of weeks.

47:26.742 --> 47:31.830
I'm giving a talk at the Grolier Club in two weeks, and I may see them again.

47:31.850 --> 47:35.335
Okay, he's the only one, and I ask him to say anything about it.

47:35.635 --> 47:38.098
But also, I wanted to know how much there.

47:38.498 --> 47:40.901
So, you know, that was one reason.

47:40.921 --> 47:43.525
And people have been pretty much before there.

47:44.125 --> 47:45.527
Good and bad viable benefits.

47:45.547 --> 47:48.891
There have been a thing of many, many millions, and that's not the case.

47:48.971 --> 47:50.113
An extraordinary value.

47:50.833 --> 47:52.315
What do you think the value was, though?

47:52.656 --> 47:56.560
Yeah, as we discussed it, as difficult as that.

47:56.580 --> 47:56.921
A million?

47:57.281 --> 48:01.446
Half a million?

48:01.466 --> 48:02.187
Oh, no, no, no.

48:02.507 --> 48:03.068
I don't think so.

48:03.088 --> 48:03.769
18 before 1473 is...

48:04.205 --> 48:07.990
Yes, but I've also, yes, thank you also for talking.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.632
It is still very very well.

48:09.652 --> 48:10.974
I would think, I don't think so.

48:11.034 --> 48:12.716
There are a few copies of that book.

48:13.617 --> 48:19.905
And of course it's... This copy, there are actually a few leaves, but the people are more of a copy of that book, yes.

48:22.388 --> 48:23.850
Very interesting.
