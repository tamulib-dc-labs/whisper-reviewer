WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:13.341
We're talking to Dr. Otto Bettmann, and you were going to show me some things that you said.

00:13.361 --> 00:31.540
Oh yeah, these are, you know, I do not have, I do not have any, any items really, very shoe things, but I have, I have quite a considerable collection of, of

00:31.688 --> 00:39.719
slides which I can get back from Batman in 8x10 crosses.

00:40.179 --> 00:41.721
These are magnificent.

00:42.502 --> 00:46.027
I wish we'd have had these for our book.

00:47.229 --> 00:55.840
Well, I mean, it's not the overwhelming, but this enormous power of the book that in the Middle Ages

00:56.157 --> 01:09.595
People studied it by reading books, but there was only one book available, and the professor had it, and from the pulpit he read out of Hippocrates.

01:10.417 --> 01:23.194
And if the students here at the medical school anatomized or dissected the body, and they found...

01:23.427 --> 01:50.346
difference between the natural setup of the human body and compared with what Hippocrates or Galen or one of the great doctors said people always at that time were such great lovers and admirals of books that they

01:50.866 --> 02:03.781
that they always gave the bookish knowledge, the precedent over what they found in nature, the enormous power of the book.

02:04.963 --> 02:20.181
But anyway, these are just early printing presses and how the enormous power of the book

02:20.853 --> 02:29.326
overruled, uh, overruled, uh, reality.

02:31.129 --> 02:33.973
Where did you, now, where did you find these illustrations?

02:34.053 --> 02:36.557
Are these things that you gathered on your own, or?

02:36.577 --> 02:44.269
Well, in print shops, in, in print shops, in a library, uh, there are book rooms.

02:45.711 --> 02:48.575
I traveled around at my little library.

02:48.656 --> 02:49.577
At that time,

02:49.945 --> 02:52.327
conditions were very liberal.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.990
People welcomed you.

02:55.050 --> 03:01.796
You found something, and you got started with your little library, a Leica stand.

03:01.816 --> 03:16.690
You just photographed these things, and then I arranged them not by artist, as was a rule, but by subject.

03:16.710 --> 03:19.513
These are pictures that you shot yourself with your Leica?

03:19.848 --> 03:22.171
Yeah, at the beginning.

03:22.291 --> 03:26.256
This, for instance, is an interesting picture.

03:26.276 --> 03:29.901
I forgot now which scene it is.

03:30.882 --> 03:43.858
In a way, too bad I had to loan a friend my protector that could have shown it to you in quick succession.

03:44.559 --> 03:49.045
This was a first pencil, for instance.

03:49.413 --> 04:15.660
I was very, I applied to all these pictures more a commercial aspect that I, that I, the art of reading, for instance, this famous picture where a man invented a reading wheel that he could read many, many pictures at one time.

04:16.001 --> 04:18.323
And that has a certain prophetic aspect

04:18.893 --> 04:31.551
prophetic impact for us or we have come to read to read in a circular manner in a CD today.

04:31.571 --> 04:35.096
Yes, absolutely.

04:35.216 --> 04:37.800
Are these pictures that you took in Leipzig?

04:39.001 --> 04:42.607
No, I travel.

04:42.627 --> 04:47.213
It might be in Luxembourg or Holland or

04:47.615 --> 05:09.198
But my idea was simply that art is not only a representation or reflection of the artist's own feelings or beliefs, but that these things also give us a history of how men lived.

05:09.218 --> 05:15.004
The cultural aspect is often very, very interesting, too.

05:15.645 --> 05:17.487
It isn't only that...

05:17.787 --> 05:23.093
Rembrandt painted a mother with a baby.

05:23.193 --> 05:44.136
It's not only a Rembrandt-ish idea, but it gives us an idea how people lived, how they made a living, and how they read this wonderful tour of the pictures of St.

05:44.196 --> 05:44.436
Joan.

05:44.753 --> 05:46.115
alone in the cell.

05:46.516 --> 06:00.276
That doesn't quite reflect the beauty of all these pictures, but this thing I had a sort of filing system.

06:01.418 --> 06:14.237
This picture did not only appear under the name of the artist, but it was a subject-wise cross-index that showed

06:14.622 --> 06:19.247
angels or guarding angels.

06:19.347 --> 06:30.179
This man uses the forerunner of the modern pencil, the silver point.

06:31.441 --> 06:40.811
And you could affect an impact on a piece of parchment.

06:41.232 --> 06:44.275
Only paper was not in general use.

06:44.592 --> 06:47.256
And so the pictures were very small.

06:48.017 --> 06:54.867
These silver point early drawings of the 15th century, the great works of art.

06:55.989 --> 07:06.064
And here the devil is compelled to have the idea of how books were read.

07:06.084 --> 07:11.933
And here the devil is compelled to hold the Bible in front of

07:12.655 --> 07:18.884
But this isn't terribly interesting for you.

07:19.004 --> 07:22.188
You mentioned the phrase when you started, the power of the book.

07:22.629 --> 07:25.393
That's a phrase that you used, the power of the book.

07:25.853 --> 07:26.895
Yes, it is.

07:27.856 --> 07:32.202
Today, it's the TV.

07:32.643 --> 07:36.648
The book is really a little bit offensive, I must say.

07:37.509 --> 07:41.515
Young people don't see the book as...

07:42.085 --> 07:48.975
a sense of medium of communication, and we feel ourselves to the way a little pedantically.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.619
Are you fearful about the future of the book?

07:51.980 --> 07:52.941
Are you fearful?

07:53.021 --> 07:54.343
Not, not.

07:54.363 --> 07:55.585
Why don't you sit down, darling?

07:55.605 --> 07:58.850
No, you, please, make yourself.

07:58.970 --> 08:03.577
But I'd like to offer you an opportunity or something.

08:03.597 --> 08:05.981
Maybe go out for lunch.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.603
Okay, whatever, but we'd like to...

08:08.225 --> 08:11.969
I just want you to be comfortable, and we'll conduct the interview.

08:11.989 --> 08:38.198
Yes, I think the book is maybe not in decline, but on the defense of the young people, I think they can sit there passively in front of the television set, and being full-fed, what they want you to know, reading,

08:39.258 --> 08:47.772
does involve and does compel participation with the author.

08:47.792 --> 08:55.545
And this is more and more being pushed into the background.

08:55.565 --> 09:04.219
It is rather pitiful often when one talks to young people, how little they know.

09:04.537 --> 09:07.942
But I may be a cultural vulture.

09:07.962 --> 09:13.351
Maybe too much oriented after the book.

09:13.451 --> 09:16.856
I come from a very bookish background.

09:16.916 --> 09:20.262
My father was a doctor and a great bibliographer.

09:20.282 --> 09:25.430
And Leipzig, where I was born, it's all in this book there.

09:26.031 --> 09:32.080
There was a great book down town.

09:33.038 --> 09:57.713
printers lived there and also of course Bach and so we were educated very early in the necessity to read and in the beauty of books and to bed and I don't have my projector here I could have shown this in a minute

09:57.862 --> 10:01.126
I love the conversation, actually.

10:01.147 --> 10:03.490
I prefer that.

10:04.271 --> 10:13.223
It's a pretty steep German accent.

10:13.243 --> 10:15.186
You received your Ph.D.

10:15.206 --> 10:22.816
in 1927, I believe, which is almost 70 years ago, and then you were a curator of rare books.

10:23.717 --> 10:27.042
So you must have thought at that time that your life would be in books.

10:27.427 --> 10:34.098
Yes, it was a matter of course.

10:34.318 --> 10:36.201
I would be a bookman.

10:36.221 --> 10:41.170
My other preference, I would have liked to become a doctor like my father.

10:42.211 --> 10:53.670
But in this book I gave you, I think you hear the whole history of...

11:01.919 --> 11:03.020
We'll find that, Doctor.

11:03.040 --> 11:26.210
You don't have to look that up.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.833
I'm just going to look at the Campbell Bank.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.213
This was the book.

11:28.919 --> 11:58.420
my father was a collector of a man by the name of other names in the 17th century 17th century monk Jesuit priest who was strangely interested in mechanics and he invented things like

11:58.838 --> 12:08.029
like the first Latana Magica, not too far away from our modern gadget.

12:08.510 --> 12:14.377
He was very much interested in sound transmission.

12:15.558 --> 12:17.140
My father had this book.

12:17.281 --> 12:19.824
I wasn't able to bring it here.

12:19.964 --> 12:23.428
If I brought it here, I had to sell it.

12:24.168 --> 12:29.173
I assume, but a reprint of this is available.

12:29.193 --> 12:36.260
It shows... Oh, okay, I see it, yes.

12:36.280 --> 12:42.686
This was written in Latin, of course.

12:43.387 --> 12:51.255
And whenever there was a new Kirscher book, when my father came into my father's Bailey Wick,

12:51.708 --> 13:06.506
The children were called down into his office, and he admired... Your father called you to admire the books that he... Your father called the children in to admire the books that he obtained?

13:06.526 --> 13:07.467
Yeah.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.349
He did.

13:09.369 --> 13:13.555
The most interesting man.

13:17.459 --> 13:20.483
Anyway, so we were bound to...

13:20.750 --> 13:49.390
Maybe there are redeeming factors today.

13:49.842 --> 14:01.214
People know more, but what they know is less deep and less absorbed by the mind.

14:01.234 --> 14:02.795
It all becomes visual.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.579
So I made a living of sorts through the visual.

14:07.260 --> 14:19.512
I must admit I'm a great believer in reading and really coming face to face with the past and the wisdom of the past.

14:19.863 --> 14:23.068
It can't, that pictures cannot give you.

14:24.309 --> 14:24.630
Really?

14:25.231 --> 14:29.416
So I bite a hand to it, it fed me.

14:31.059 --> 14:35.725
But you have, but you amassed perhaps three million images.

14:36.787 --> 14:41.173
I think you gathered about three million images in your... Yes, I did.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.177
I was simply picture mad.

14:44.658 --> 14:47.642
I don't know who, why, but...

14:47.791 --> 14:49.433
I thought it was missing.

14:49.493 --> 15:13.247
We have great picture repositories that show us the outer life, but the inner life that only books can convey to us and urge us on to think about the world and improve our own status in it.

15:14.228 --> 15:17.713
So it's very paradoxical.

15:18.048 --> 15:47.042
really uh my father was in a group of uh of biblio fields uh yeah

15:47.512 --> 15:49.495
in access to this club.

15:50.276 --> 15:50.616
Ninety-nine.

15:50.636 --> 15:51.197
Ninety-nine.

15:51.697 --> 15:52.739
Yeah.

15:52.779 --> 15:53.920
What was the name of the group?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.385
The Leipzig Bitlufar.

15:57.405 --> 15:57.505
Ah.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.050
The Leipziger Bitlufield Art.

16:01.150 --> 16:02.832
And these are there?

16:03.413 --> 16:08.359
These are some of their offerings that I still have.

16:08.379 --> 16:09.941
Beautifully printed.

16:09.961 --> 16:14.447
The Leipziger Bitlufield and everybody

16:15.068 --> 16:18.172
Batman was in here, Johannes Batman.

16:19.274 --> 16:21.357
This is your father?

16:21.797 --> 16:27.805
Yeah.

16:27.825 --> 16:32.973
Anyway, so we were educated in the book.

16:33.573 --> 16:34.635
May I look at it, Doctor?

16:34.775 --> 16:36.277
No, but it all means there's nothing.

16:37.258 --> 16:40.263
Why don't you call me Otto, for sure?

16:40.443 --> 16:42.105
Yes, sir.

16:43.925 --> 16:49.772
Well, I would be honored to call you also, but I feel that you dropped your best one, honestly.

16:49.892 --> 17:00.865
No, you have just my... So you expected to spend your career as a bookman, of course.

17:01.045 --> 17:05.291
Yes, well, that's... Then one came Hitler and the chain bill.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.934
Yeah, it's true.

17:08.054 --> 17:12.379
And then this, my coming to America was...

17:12.781 --> 17:25.557
simply a miracle, as if God had held out a hand and took me out of this terrible, hopeless situation.

17:25.617 --> 17:41.657
I would have been the first one to be picked up for the concentration camp, but luckily we had very good friends and relatives, bad months.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.125
in Cincinnati and St.

17:45.205 --> 17:50.389
Louis, and they brought me to London to be disgusted.

17:51.350 --> 17:54.133
We always looked at Hitler as a joke.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.235
We said it could not last.

17:56.735 --> 17:58.437
It was simply ridiculous.

17:59.758 --> 18:09.467
And, of course, all of a sudden he was chancellor, and he issued a UCAS,

18:09.835 --> 18:39.572
all the Jews in state positions would have to leave immediately and so I left this job as assistant curator in the Berlin Art Library but I still had already collected via photographs some subject pictures so medicine the history of medicine or the history of

18:40.075 --> 18:43.658
of books itself, the history of reading.

18:44.419 --> 18:51.665
And I was lucky enough then to establish a business that could use these.

18:51.685 --> 19:08.901
You had medical situations and people who were through sleeping pills, all of a sudden

19:09.337 --> 19:14.363
I felt it might be nice to make a history of sleeping pills.

19:16.085 --> 19:35.007
In former sleeping media, there's, for instance, a very interesting picture of an aristocrat who couldn't sleep, and he called in a Fittler to...

19:36.725 --> 19:55.346
to simply play soft melodies, to simply fiddle him to sleep, or other funny situations.

19:55.867 --> 20:06.259
Anyway, the commercial avenue was still open, so I said if they don't want me as a librarian, scholar,

20:06.610 --> 20:17.882
try maybe to do that and sell pictures for industrial use, advertising illustrations.

20:17.902 --> 20:22.206
Did you try to get a position as a scholar and an academic here for it?

20:22.286 --> 20:23.227
No, not really.

20:23.247 --> 20:24.629
I did it on my own.

20:24.829 --> 20:35.200
I simply wrote to Bayer Asperen and said, why don't you use this picture, this ancient medical picture for

20:35.737 --> 20:39.022
for a sleeping pill or something.

20:39.402 --> 20:57.767
That was already quite common in Germany, and you still could do business as a Jew, but then everybody had to become a member of the ICE commerce unit.

20:57.787 --> 21:03.055
You received a number, and if you don't have this number, you couldn't do business.

21:03.375 --> 21:03.415
So

21:04.103 --> 21:14.113
My relatives in Cincinnati, Alfred Bettmann and others, thought I was foolish to stay in Germany.

21:14.133 --> 21:29.908
But I was a totally, totally sold and Germanic Kultur with a capital T. It was simply awful.

21:30.243 --> 21:35.390
And you couldn't do that either, and I simply had to emigrate.

21:35.410 --> 21:58.140
And here I found the most ready acceptance, and it was happy, happy, and quite fulfilled, and even starting to make a living, setting up an archive and contacting various people where they produce it for

21:58.559 --> 22:01.684
commercial use, textbook people.

22:01.704 --> 22:26.862
One of the first people that visited me in a small little back home with a friend bookseller had given me a slap there and photographed my

22:27.517 --> 22:56.832
material and so the publishers too became interested and one of the first one who visited me was Mr. Lincoln Schuster I guess you are a little bit too young to remember him he was a great figure Simon and Schuster you know and he came and he himself was so

22:57.183 --> 23:01.048
So very interested in pictures.

23:03.350 --> 23:03.991
Another picture historian.

23:04.011 --> 23:04.171
Yeah.

23:04.191 --> 23:06.514
And he calls you another picture historian.

23:07.315 --> 23:11.640
Because you and your letterhead describe yourself as a graphic historian.

23:12.121 --> 23:13.182
Yeah.

23:13.663 --> 23:21.772
Which I think is so fascinating, and it is so quintessential, quintessentially 20th century.

23:22.012 --> 23:24.756
Yeah, very, very, very interesting.

23:24.776 --> 23:25.857
What I'm interested in is,

23:26.140 --> 23:31.848
perception that you had to realize when you got your first Leica camera.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.293
Well, I was really pushed into it.

23:35.313 --> 23:38.637
I can't take great credit for it.

23:38.657 --> 23:52.877
My father was a great hontanologist and he had a little dark room in his clinic and I simply got started.

23:54.079 --> 23:55.000
And when we had

23:55.672 --> 24:00.157
visit us for the birthday of the children.

24:00.197 --> 24:05.463
My father became his successor in the clinic, but he didn't last.

24:05.643 --> 24:12.951
He had to leave very soon, too.

24:12.971 --> 24:22.641
Anyway, he called the children down and showed us x-rays and pictures and asked us to

24:23.127 --> 24:46.333
I read in the New York Times that you came here with two trunks, two steam trunks of photographic images, and five dollars in chains or something like that.

24:46.955 --> 24:49.438
What were the photographs that you brought?

24:49.458 --> 24:51.260
What essentially were they, the pictures?

24:51.280 --> 24:53.583
Well, they were mostly Germanic things.

24:53.863 --> 25:02.854
I mean, hunting, royalty, or maybe also much on bookmaking.

25:02.994 --> 25:13.907
I was simply on account of this book interest that was early woven.

25:14.242 --> 25:17.888
Leipzig was a great center for that.

25:18.989 --> 25:26.461
It had the role that you probably have heard of, the Frankfurt Book Fair.

25:26.501 --> 25:28.004
Oh, the most famous.

25:28.024 --> 25:31.609
It was really located in Leipzig.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.697
But the Russians actually destroyed that somewhat.

25:36.878 --> 25:41.565
I mean, when the Russians came in, it was really barbaric.

25:41.866 --> 25:44.789
nobody wanted to come to Leipzig anymore.

25:45.690 --> 25:49.414
And so, uh, uh, Frankfurt stool, it's thunder.

25:52.137 --> 25:59.625
Did you have a sense that when, I mean, the things you chose to take to the United States with you was photographs?

25:59.645 --> 25:59.825
Yeah.

26:00.025 --> 26:04.249
Well, I was a little afraid that they wouldn't let this out.

26:04.370 --> 26:11.417
I looked at them as other precious, uh, possessions, but, uh, they, uh,

26:11.785 --> 26:41.421
people rather thought me crazy and I explained them they said well that's all good and well you go into America but how do you want to make a living after all these historical things they're fine for us culture Germans the Germans were always so proud but they didn't really prove it with their concentration camps so anyway

26:41.738 --> 26:54.071
They were afraid that I couldn't make a living with picture research and offering industry and the publisher's pictorial histories.

26:55.853 --> 27:05.103
They said that America is oriented towards the future, not the past.

27:05.123 --> 27:09.147
The past plays absolutely no role in America.

27:09.532 --> 27:39.083
it's such a mistaken idea for I found the interest really in historical things quite remarkable and one must consider that America has a relatively short history packed thousands of years of German empire into 200 years since our history is so short we really are very anxious to

27:39.620 --> 27:47.447
to study it and get directions from it.

27:47.467 --> 27:53.232
So I found that Robert, business Robert, picked up quickly.

27:54.173 --> 28:01.679
And one friend here in New York whom I explained my idea, how do you want to make a living here?

28:02.500 --> 28:08.445
He said, throw all this stuff into the huts.

28:08.881 --> 28:16.909
America in general had this enormous reputation for being present-minded.

28:17.690 --> 28:26.819
Of course, it's quite true, but I found a great sense of the historic, really.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.923
Of course, what you perceived is the importance of the graphic side.

28:31.623 --> 28:33.766
Yes, to show the picture.

28:34.026 --> 28:36.068
That was not my merit.

28:36.168 --> 28:38.230
I lost some sort of a hunch that

28:38.581 --> 29:02.361
we did approach the picture age and that the birds really became somewhat undecrated everything in pictures the founding of Life magazine simply turned everything into the pictorial and even the newspapers today

29:02.729 --> 29:10.569
I think even the Times would like much more of a pictorial imaging.

29:10.649 --> 29:15.962
I think they even built now a big plant to handle color pictures.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.282
It's we see that.

29:17.622 --> 29:20.687
I do a weekly newspaper column that I sell to newspapers.

29:20.707 --> 29:21.969
Yeah, you told me that.

29:21.989 --> 29:27.217
And what they're interested in most is not just the story, but what they call the art.

29:28.078 --> 29:28.478
Oh, really?

29:28.498 --> 29:29.981
The photograph.

29:30.001 --> 29:33.166
So we furnish the pictures to go with.

29:33.186 --> 29:38.494
Are these book criticisms, or what is it?

29:38.514 --> 29:44.042
Well, what I do is an interview like we're doing now with an individual who has written a book.

29:44.393 --> 29:45.815
and I, of course, read the books.

29:45.955 --> 29:54.908
But then I will either take some photographs, or photographs will be furnished to us, and then we distribute copies of these to the newspaper clients.

29:55.328 --> 29:58.953
Not unlike what you did, but that's part of the package that we sell.

29:59.454 --> 30:00.776
Syndicate.

30:01.317 --> 30:02.658
Exactly, exactly.

30:03.560 --> 30:07.806
And what is happening now is that film is going to disappear.

30:07.866 --> 30:09.428
It's all going to be on microchips.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.392
You're going to be taking pictures with a camera and...

30:12.862 --> 30:18.047
The computer thing, it's really undecrated.

30:18.087 --> 30:32.921
Today, if you want a picture of a man beating his wife, you simply type it out on the computer, don't you?

30:32.941 --> 30:34.002
That's right.

30:34.022 --> 30:40.168
Well, all the photographs that Mr. Gates bought from the Redman Archive, they're all being digitized.

30:40.317 --> 30:42.542
They're all going to be put into computers.

30:45.468 --> 30:51.542
So you don't need the admission of the photographs and paper and all that.

30:51.903 --> 30:56.132
What's going to happen is you can call up on your computer, at your home computer,

30:56.770 --> 31:04.902
And you'll call, and you'll ask for a picture, and they'll show you the Winston Churchill picture that you have, or the Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio picture.

31:05.122 --> 31:08.507
I wonder how they get reproducible copies.

31:08.827 --> 31:11.531
It's amazing, but it's right over the computer.

31:11.651 --> 31:12.613
It's digitized.

31:12.953 --> 31:17.119
But how do you, because Gates knows he wants to get paid for it.

31:17.139 --> 31:18.401
That's what they're figuring out.

31:18.501 --> 31:24.109
You have an account with them, and in order to copy it, you pay a fee.

31:24.129 --> 31:24.229
Yeah.

31:24.698 --> 31:26.980
And I guess that's how it works, right?

31:27.861 --> 31:28.162
I have no idea.

31:28.182 --> 31:30.244
I have no idea how it works, but they're going to work on it.

31:30.344 --> 31:42.938
And that's what is really fascinating, isn't it, how your focus on the graphic history of the 20th century is now going to get an entirely new life in the 21st century and beyond.

31:42.958 --> 31:43.418
Yeah, that's right.

31:43.438 --> 31:47.102
And that is fascinating from my standpoint, as you can see.

31:47.203 --> 31:51.347
I mean, the intermediate steps are eliminated.

31:51.563 --> 31:53.725
No more paper, no more documents.

31:53.745 --> 32:01.512
People ask us for, excuse me, a whorehouse.

32:01.532 --> 32:06.696
You seem a dirty, dirty friend of mine.

32:06.716 --> 32:20.068
In New York City, you simply, in the olden days, you would get 10 pictures around Photofire, put it in an envelope,

32:20.555 --> 32:30.009
and send it out and then hope that one picture will be accepted and you have to be changing for it.

32:30.089 --> 32:34.396
So all the intermediate steps are now eliminated.

32:34.416 --> 32:40.745
Eliminated to the point now that you'll be buying a camera like this without any film.

32:41.466 --> 32:45.212
You'll take a picture and the picture will be on a computer chip.

32:45.648 --> 32:48.550
And you can buy these now, isn't that right?

32:48.590 --> 33:01.101
And then you'll take that chip home to your computer, and you'll load it onto the computer, and this is how they will send the pictures to the newspapers, by digitized information.

33:01.241 --> 33:04.063
And that's what Mr. Gates is going to do with all of your photographs.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.345
He's going to digitize them all.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.807
It's amazing, isn't it?

33:08.847 --> 33:10.108
It is a new world.

33:10.309 --> 33:12.030
No, I have a question for you.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.792
It doesn't make much for literacy.

33:14.812 --> 33:15.553
I don't know.

33:16.158 --> 33:24.447
And this is a very sad thing with the absolute decline of your own.

33:24.507 --> 33:28.792
That is a participatory process.

33:28.812 --> 33:40.564
You know, when you read and try to conjure up what happened in 1830, Napoleon and Helena.

33:40.584 --> 33:43.988
Yes, you see it, and it's wonderful.

33:44.457 --> 33:57.432
Do we know that Napoleon was an enormous reader, that he had a special man in a big library, and every hour he asked for a new book?

33:58.613 --> 34:07.844
I think all that lama and the really fine point and the oddities are eliminated.

34:07.864 --> 34:13.030
So I'm really a traitor on my trade for Napoleon.

34:13.567 --> 34:23.479
I do am fully conscious that what you see is very one mind, one directed.

34:25.281 --> 34:33.590
Do you know this new magazine that the Library of Congress publishes, Civilization?

34:33.611 --> 34:34.031
I've heard of it.

34:34.051 --> 34:34.852
It's supposed to be one of them.

34:34.872 --> 34:36.534
Yeah, it's very lovely.

34:36.554 --> 34:38.616
We're going to have to subscribe.

34:38.636 --> 34:43.422
Anyway, they have a department, the last page,

34:43.756 --> 35:13.341
called Caption in which I don't think I have caption in which all the people say how wonderful one can describe the great events of history and I have written a little piece there in which I show a picture of Albert Schweitzer

35:14.249 --> 35:41.893
near his organ in Lamborghini just a bushy old man you know and I said how little this really tells us about this enormous enormous phenomenon theologian doctor missionary Bach player etc pictures do not make us

35:42.413 --> 35:45.016
make us civilized.

35:45.796 --> 36:04.775
They're a nice, a nice pageant of things, but they don't really lead us like, like, like words into the inner man.

36:05.996 --> 36:09.940
So, again, I, I,

36:11.320 --> 36:21.718
the clear war against the medium that has kept me alive.

36:22.078 --> 36:26.766
I heard you interviewed on National Public Radio right after the archive.

36:26.886 --> 36:28.569
Yeah, I didn't hear it, yeah.

36:28.629 --> 36:29.651
In fact, I taped it.

36:29.791 --> 36:30.612
I have it at home.

36:30.633 --> 36:31.594
Oh, really, yeah.

36:31.754 --> 36:36.282
It's an imperfect copy, but I'd be happy to make a copy of it and send it to you if you haven't heard it.

36:36.380 --> 36:38.163
I'd be more than happy to do that.

36:38.503 --> 36:40.466
But it's rather negative.

36:40.626 --> 36:50.481
I don't think that does contribute very much to you or what you want to do.

36:50.521 --> 36:52.885
I wish you would ask me, Robert.

36:53.205 --> 36:54.848
I'm talking by myself.

36:55.208 --> 36:59.875
You're really covering the areas that I want to cover.

37:00.236 --> 37:01.898
Were you ever interested in being

37:02.603 --> 37:09.753
a photographer yourself on the, on the, on the level, say, of a Steichen or an... No, no, I was rather cool.

37:09.873 --> 37:20.669
I, I must admit, I, I never wanted to, to, to, um, to put my energies into this.

37:21.230 --> 37:23.773
I'm not very, not very good at it.

37:25.175 --> 37:32.526
My first Leica, yes, I admired what I could do, but I, uh,

37:33.198 --> 37:54.022
rather like to put my energy into the finding of unusual pictures and then try to not only have the pictures but interpret them and put them in the context of our whole pattern of civilization, so to speak.

37:54.042 --> 38:02.091
I always was more of a historian, a picture historian, and one who once

38:02.645 --> 38:09.351
to perpetuate very odd situations, oddities, and such things.

38:09.952 --> 38:18.840
So I think we're going a little bit too far, but I think it's a bit worse.

38:18.860 --> 38:29.850
I think we cannot escape this trend, and people who are not quite of this age never quite see what...

38:30.370 --> 38:37.040
what these new novelties and these new inventions really can bring.

38:37.841 --> 38:57.610
So I'm not desperate that we go down, but I think there's a general flattening, you know, all this putting Dickens' novel into cartoon form that you can guarantee

38:57.877 --> 39:26.280
in 10 minutes you can run your way to and you know it thickens but then really all the finer points are left out the eye can by itself cannot think it cherishes the sensation but you really have to sit down and study things and put your own input into it

39:27.391 --> 39:35.561
You also acquired entire collections, as I understand it, too, of photographs.

39:35.621 --> 39:39.746
You weren't just looking for single photographic images.

39:39.806 --> 39:44.331
You also were interested in getting entire collections that other people wanted to put together.

39:44.351 --> 39:53.041
Well, you would show the development of things, you know, how things developed.

39:53.362 --> 39:55.204
I have to hear a whole

39:55.555 --> 39:58.317
I don't know whether you have seen this.

39:58.958 --> 40:04.263
I want to write that down so I can look this up at Harvard.

40:04.283 --> 40:06.224
Yeah.

40:06.244 --> 40:07.486
If I could give you a cover.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.827
No, no, it's fine.

40:08.967 --> 40:10.128
I will find it.

40:10.228 --> 40:14.011
I'm a pretty resourceful collector, and I assure you I can find this.

40:14.031 --> 40:24.921
Also, you should ... I've made a whole ... This is still available.

40:25.188 --> 40:27.911
I can find that, sir.

40:28.031 --> 40:30.533
I'll just write it down a little bit.

40:31.034 --> 40:37.821
I published this myself, my own imprint, so to speak.

40:37.841 --> 40:42.386
And I love that you used the Archim Waldo in your pictures.

40:42.886 --> 40:45.389
Oh, this is Pinky White Press.

40:45.409 --> 40:46.950
Okay, that's good.

40:47.050 --> 40:48.131
And this is 1966.

40:48.772 --> 40:52.596
I picked your house.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.849
You know, we haven't even discussed at all as the importance.

40:58.109 --> 41:04.957
I was mentioning the NPR interview, but I think you played a Bach piece, actually.

41:05.278 --> 41:07.360
Do you play Bach every day, I notice?

41:07.420 --> 41:17.773
Well, yes, I've become a little lazy, but it is an epitome of order, and order, you put order in your life.

41:18.226 --> 41:35.084
one of the most important things, and the pictures don't tell you of the struggle of people and of city life and country life, and you have to read.

41:35.164 --> 41:44.014
So I am pleading against the picture itself.

41:45.817 --> 41:49.743
But one thing the computer can't do is replicate the music.

41:50.024 --> 41:52.207
We haven't even discussed the music.

41:52.227 --> 41:54.872
They try to compose with a computer.

41:55.352 --> 41:58.578
Maybe we are blindfolded.

41:58.598 --> 42:03.405
Maybe there are possibilities that we do not see.

42:06.170 --> 42:11.318
After all, I think you mentioned that, that the ancient

42:11.568 --> 42:39.617
conservatives and the rich people in the middle ages who collected books only books written by monks with beautiful miniature illustrations deigned it improper to put all their money into

42:39.918 --> 42:41.280
into printed books.

42:41.560 --> 42:54.256
It was a form of communication that is sort of inferior to the handwritten book.

42:54.276 --> 42:58.061
This is 1978, from Random House did this.

42:58.281 --> 42:58.462
Yeah.

42:58.482 --> 43:00.224
I can get a copy of that.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.065
That's good.

43:02.665 --> 43:07.211
Connie, do you have any questions that you want to ask Dr. Bethlehem?

43:07.231 --> 43:10.055
You mentioned that your wife was in antiques, is that right?

43:10.075 --> 43:30.883
Yeah, we went to expeditions to your wonderful New England headquarters of antique furniture, and she bought furniture, and I tried to get old books with illustrations, and

43:31.522 --> 43:33.345
So we had much in common.

43:34.045 --> 43:40.514
We were very much sold on the New England charm.

43:40.574 --> 43:44.019
I think you have it there a little more than in a big city.

43:47.424 --> 43:53.032
Life has a third dimension there, which is so wonderful.

43:53.172 --> 43:59.841
In the city you live and rush around like a madman.

44:00.428 --> 44:03.351
It's a little duty to life.

44:04.412 --> 44:12.760
So I'm, by choice, a New Englander with a heavy German accent.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.143
How old are you now, Dr. Raffet?

44:15.163 --> 44:15.243
Hmm?

44:15.303 --> 44:16.204
How old are you now?

44:17.145 --> 44:17.825
How old are you?

44:17.865 --> 44:18.666
What is your age?

44:19.207 --> 44:23.311
Well, you know that I'm ready to say goodbye.

44:23.331 --> 44:24.392
I'm terrible.

44:26.154 --> 44:26.974
Ninety-two.

44:27.034 --> 44:27.575
Ninety-two.

44:27.595 --> 44:28.596
So you've actually—

44:29.200 --> 44:35.791
seen virtually the entire twentieth century as we approach the next millennium.

44:35.811 --> 44:39.557
Do you have any wisdom on what you've seen?

44:39.577 --> 44:55.123
I'm not overly curious, but I think it would be in general the typical attitude maybe of the old man who obviously, when I was young, things were better.

44:55.508 --> 45:08.527
from the man who has some, how should I call it, cultural sensitivity, I cannot quite foresee that.

45:08.667 --> 45:23.608
I think things will become more and more mechanized, and the spiritual will be pushed in the background, and more material things will

45:24.112 --> 45:27.375
to take the upper hand.

45:27.395 --> 45:53.562
I do not despise or disparage incredible progress that we have made in the unbelievable blessings that medical technology has brought us.

45:55.499 --> 46:09.275
But one of the more popular books of mine has been this books he's written, which still stands to my amazement.

46:16.804 --> 46:17.345
Wonderful.

46:17.505 --> 46:23.953
I'm rather reading my words, eating my own words, for this

46:24.490 --> 46:29.937
Did the good old days they were terrible?

46:29.957 --> 46:32.300
The good old days they were terrible.

46:32.420 --> 46:48.239
We have mechanically in our way of living made great progress, but we have not created a Michelangelo or Goethe or Emerson.

46:48.259 --> 46:53.586
The thinking is not highly priced these days.

46:54.663 --> 46:56.385
Thinking is not highly prized.

46:56.685 --> 47:00.130
No, I think people want to have more money.

47:00.210 --> 47:08.500
But they lead a sad life at times.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.123
There's a slight counter movement.

47:11.203 --> 47:14.047
I see it here in Florida.

47:14.067 --> 47:17.010
I never wanted to come to Florida.

47:17.972 --> 47:21.656
It's for the very old, but I'm part of it now.

47:22.157 --> 47:24.079
But there's a great...

47:24.481 --> 47:28.905
reaction, and the counter-movement.

47:28.925 --> 47:38.095
I mean, very fine concerts here, and the literary movements.

47:39.056 --> 47:46.303
But the main emphasis is on the materialistic, and people are quite unhappy.

47:47.744 --> 47:50.247
How long have you been in Florida now?

47:50.467 --> 47:52.429
Since, well,

47:52.932 --> 47:59.499
about 20 years, and I came in the early 70s, 73 I was.

48:01.300 --> 48:03.162
I didn't want to come, really.

48:04.704 --> 48:16.716
I sneered at this old man's country where only people and crutches are admitted.

48:17.397 --> 48:20.880
But I find it rather lively.

48:21.316 --> 48:50.158
the liveliness does not come only from bigger buildings but maybe a slight more emphasis on the intellectual and fine ballets and theater and music is described quite remarkably represented now there's always a group which

48:50.577 --> 48:56.783
does not simply want to live on the material things.

48:57.744 --> 49:04.171
Mr. Gates, in a way I understand, is a very art-conscious fellow, isn't he?

49:04.251 --> 49:05.392
Art-conscious, yes.

49:05.412 --> 49:08.896
He bought the Leonardo da Vinci Codex for $30 million.

49:08.916 --> 49:12.960
That belongs to another capitalist.

49:14.822 --> 49:15.522
It's interesting.

49:15.582 --> 49:18.766
I hope to talk to him for this next book as well.

49:18.786 --> 49:20.247
It should be very interesting to

49:20.699 --> 49:24.723
to see where he's going and, uh, what his thoughts are.

49:24.743 --> 49:26.545
He's quite a phenomenon, really.

49:26.885 --> 49:48.327
People are afraid that through his, uh, through his, uh, uh, buying up the, the copyrights to the National Gallery and the Louvre and so on, and he becomes a star of this whole field, and, uh,

49:48.779 --> 49:56.228
It will be very hard to get hold of these pressures.

49:56.308 --> 49:57.950
Are you anxious about this yourself?

49:58.811 --> 50:00.833
Is this something that concerns you as well?

50:01.594 --> 50:02.915
Well, yes.

50:02.935 --> 50:11.625
I think that the free access is a little bit impaired or threatened to be impaired.

50:14.829 --> 50:15.630
So...

50:16.184 --> 50:20.109
I don't just quite know how he is going to handle it.

50:20.470 --> 50:31.424
But I'm talking a blue streak, Mr. Baines, and you must ask me questions.

50:31.745 --> 50:32.886
I am asking you, actually.

50:32.906 --> 50:35.129
You're covering the areas that I wanted to cover.

50:35.490 --> 50:42.759
I wonder, when you talk about the power of the book, do you like to read new books or explore older ones that you loved?

50:43.420 --> 50:44.942
Tell me a little bit about your readings.

50:45.040 --> 51:07.115
I'm a victim of my own criticism for, I must admit, it is even in my very old age so very, very rare that I can read the whole, just read a book about this famous book on Mozart by Maynard.

51:08.217 --> 51:10.761
You see it in the shrinkage of books.

51:11.522 --> 51:12.904
These, these,

51:13.154 --> 51:22.924
I'm quite amazed and admired the persistence that you put out a book.

51:23.644 --> 51:25.066
She pushed me on.

51:25.106 --> 51:27.068
She said, who wants a small book?

51:27.088 --> 51:29.810
My wife loves big books, so I had to satisfy my wife.

51:29.830 --> 51:34.915
Are you okay to hear of big books, Dostoyevsky?

51:34.935 --> 51:35.616
Tolstoy.

51:35.796 --> 51:37.578
Tolstoy, Balzac.

51:37.598 --> 51:38.959
She's reading Google now.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.601
But there's a time.

51:40.821 --> 51:42.823
It's shameful.

51:43.107 --> 51:53.218
A man of my age really seemingly disengaged in many worldly things.

51:55.421 --> 52:00.466
My greatest pleasure, I must admit, was still writing letters.

52:01.448 --> 52:12.540
And I'm lucky enough to have a young lady so terribly far away whom I write letters to.

52:13.212 --> 52:26.069
But it used to do, I just got this new book on Mozart by Neymar Solomon.

52:26.329 --> 52:27.151
I think I know.

52:27.171 --> 52:28.572
We know the book.

52:28.653 --> 52:29.834
I know the book, Doctor.

52:30.155 --> 52:32.097
I know the book.

52:32.538 --> 52:39.507
It is interesting, but if you find this half hour before fall asleep, it's...

52:39.723 --> 52:49.442
Even for me, who is so totally disengaged in the usual activities of life, it is kind of tough.

52:50.644 --> 52:53.810
It's heavy.

52:53.830 --> 52:55.073
It's heavy.

52:55.093 --> 52:55.493
Yes.

52:55.514 --> 53:02.507
And there is, when you look at new books, they have all shrunk in size, big...

53:02.740 --> 53:08.285
terribly picked books, but please, I admire your book.

53:08.406 --> 53:30.047
It is incredibly rich in material, but people are not inclined to... Yes, my one point is about others who might have come with you from Leipzig or Germany, bookmen and scholars,

53:30.483 --> 53:32.645
And what happened to them?

53:32.765 --> 53:36.008
Were they able to shift over?

53:36.048 --> 53:36.909
Yes, as you did.

53:37.730 --> 53:41.053
They write magazine articles.

53:41.774 --> 53:48.160
There's an enormous increase in magazine numbers, this and there.

53:49.241 --> 53:57.148
And the whole tendency turned towards

53:57.466 --> 54:03.252
speed, a quick take-in of long books.

54:03.472 --> 54:26.916
I have always, it may be a paradox, I thought, but when I retire, I don't have to be in the office at 8 o'clock, then I catch up again with all these books, War on Peace, and I find myself super deprived of time, and I do not listen to television more than

54:27.284 --> 54:30.309
Maybe ten minutes a day.

54:31.611 --> 54:32.853
You're still working.

54:32.893 --> 54:37.160
You mentioned that you came to Florida reluctantly, but that you've come to like it.

54:37.180 --> 54:39.003
Do you miss Manhattan, on the other hand?

54:39.023 --> 54:41.467
Did you really enjoy New York City a lot?

54:41.687 --> 54:42.409
Well, yes.

54:42.529 --> 54:45.674
When I was younger, I didn't want to hear of Florida.

54:46.215 --> 54:50.422
It was a very lively, wonderful existence.

54:51.063 --> 54:54.388
My wife was very active in the antique business field.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.854
We lived in a certain place.

54:56.874 --> 55:01.358
The office was quite impressive.

55:03.580 --> 55:09.646
But I thought I would never leave New York in its temple.

55:10.346 --> 55:13.489
But I found great attraction here, too.

55:13.509 --> 55:23.278
I got connected with the library, the Florida Atlantic Library, a very fine place where

55:23.917 --> 55:25.519
highly computerized.

55:27.982 --> 55:34.709
As a matter of fact, in two weeks we have a big shindig.

55:35.751 --> 55:41.757
I hate it, but I have to submit myself to it.

55:41.777 --> 55:45.281
I have built up there to a little picture department.

55:47.264 --> 55:47.985
You have.

55:48.445 --> 55:50.007
You have, is that right?

55:50.027 --> 55:50.127
Yeah.

55:51.912 --> 56:03.829
trying to sneak out of a little evening of... We haven't even talked about Bach at all.

56:04.410 --> 56:05.511
We should a little bit.

56:06.433 --> 56:08.796
We talk about a passion.

56:09.196 --> 56:13.763
I don't know if the photos were ever a passion for you.

56:14.905 --> 56:16.847
No, I wouldn't say no.

56:17.128 --> 56:18.610
I wouldn't say a passion.

56:19.271 --> 56:20.873
They come to me as a

56:21.292 --> 56:47.890
message from the past in a way and there are no pictures that I really definitely love and find fulfilling it doesn't give me quite enough it's all surface stuff the pictorial gives you the surface of things

56:48.477 --> 57:02.011
And you need the deepening, at least intellectually interested people need the deepening of the world.

57:03.953 --> 57:11.761
Let's see where I have this article there.

57:12.922 --> 57:16.105
Through the seeing of

57:16.422 --> 57:17.903
Norman Cousins.

57:18.164 --> 57:19.185
Is he still alive?

57:19.205 --> 57:19.966
Oh, yes, I think.

57:20.086 --> 57:21.988
I'm not so sure if he's still alive or not.

57:22.128 --> 57:22.929
Cousins, Norman Cousins.

57:22.949 --> 57:30.817
Yeah, he was, uh, editor of The Seventy, uh, Saturday Evening Post, I think, right?

57:30.877 --> 57:31.277
I'm sorry.

57:31.297 --> 57:31.617
Yeah.

57:31.697 --> 57:43.189
Anyway, he, uh, he makes a very fine statement that, too, he's on my side and, uh, regrets, uh, uh,

57:45.295 --> 58:01.915
that a verb can do considerably more than a big snap photo impression, which catches only the outside of things.

58:02.816 --> 58:09.965
Are you deeply involved in your husband's activities?

58:10.265 --> 58:11.927
Do you have a feeling you are...

58:12.498 --> 58:14.360
Good second Hitler.

58:14.980 --> 58:16.142
I'm second Hitler.

58:16.162 --> 58:17.283
He does all the work.

58:17.403 --> 58:19.065
I'm just there.

58:19.505 --> 58:21.267
She's being very modest, really.

58:21.347 --> 58:26.852
This book was her idea, I have to say.

58:26.892 --> 58:27.113
Really?

58:27.293 --> 58:37.543
It is a book after my taste, but I wish you couldn't only buy the book.

58:38.047 --> 58:45.266
But also good by the time to read it thoroughly.

58:46.449 --> 58:48.154
I'm just going to trim this.

58:48.174 --> 58:50.841
I get angry at myself for not reading more.
