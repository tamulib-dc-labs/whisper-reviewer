00:02.663 --> 00:13.394
period of Elizabeth's life, when she was in her 20s, her 40s, and her 60s.

00:13.495 --> 00:30.713
In 1933, as a senior advisor, as early as the sound or the high-tech house, when she was a senior advisor, she began an exchange of letters with Donald Stanford, who later became an editor of the Southern Review.

00:33.697 --> 00:36.020
dated October 29, 1933.

00:36.180 --> 00:49.617
I'm a senior here, taking mostly what we wrongly call independent studies in English and also in Greek.

00:50.959 --> 00:57.768
The nicest thing I'm doing, I guess, is a translation of Aristophanes' Suburbs into English verse.

00:58.929 --> 01:01.172
As the old lady who supertends this,

01:01.692 --> 01:07.540
believes the ideal translation was the halfway between Gilbert Murray and T.S.

01:07.740 --> 01:16.211
Eliot, with nothing cute in it, and rather hard.

01:16.291 --> 01:30.450
There, she and Sandra were exchanging letters about their columns, their current production, published by Hounds and Horns, a marvelous magazine of the 30s, which

01:31.865 --> 01:36.570
edited by Richard Blackman and which was founded by William Kirstie.

01:38.112 --> 01:46.701
She says to Seneca, what on earth do you mean when you say my perceptions are, quote, almost impossible for a woman?

01:48.483 --> 01:50.746
Now what the hell has you said to me?

01:50.886 --> 01:52.347
You know that's meaningless.

01:53.168 --> 01:57.653
And if you really do mean anything by it, I imagine it would make me very angry.

01:58.814 --> 02:08.925
Is there some glandular reason which prevents a woman from having good perceptions or what?

02:08.945 --> 02:10.509
It's a wonderful cold night here.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.756
I live up in a tower.

02:27.907 --> 02:30.872
the elaborate Victorian iron railings.

02:31.292 --> 02:34.958
It's a very nice spot to smoke a dishonest cigarette.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.945
We are gradually filling the roof gutters with butts.

02:39.566 --> 02:45.295
A month later she writes to one of her oldest friends, Franny Blau.

02:45.996 --> 02:48.480
Franny had gone to the Walnut Hill

02:57.691 --> 03:20.982
the rest of their lives training with a tremendous help to me in editing the book of letters this is december 12 1933 i'm i'm pretty sick of college and the things i'm doing don't make good letters this awful cloud that hangs over senior year thinking all the time where shall i be next year

03:28.977 --> 03:32.943
giving the birds the third hall, so I want to get it done.

03:33.624 --> 03:34.526
I think you'd like it.

03:35.047 --> 03:38.893
It goes very fast, and the box is really very entertaining.

03:40.576 --> 03:44.402
In a few days, I'm to read what's done of the birds to the classical society.

03:44.942 --> 03:45.624
What glory.

03:47.046 --> 03:51.773
I think those two old ladies, just wait till I can't wait, the obscene parts.

03:52.975 --> 03:54.057
I found out to my

03:59.268 --> 04:05.417
the Masa librarian, is a friend of Marion Moore.

04:06.379 --> 04:12.027
She offered to write me a letter if I wanted to go to see her, and I'm so surprised at this point.

04:12.548 --> 04:21.782
She first met Marion Moore when the poet was a little girl who had brilliant red hair and called everyone she knew by the names of animals.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.176
That, in a way, changed her life.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.417
She did go see her.

04:41.437 --> 04:48.444
She met her outside of the reference room of the New York Public Library on the fence on the right-hand side of the doorway.

04:49.586 --> 04:50.366
Momentous meeting.

04:51.488 --> 04:57.554
Now, 20 years later, in her 40s, Elizabeth is in South America.

04:58.034 --> 05:02.079
She's living with a lot of salaris who has two houses.

05:02.219 --> 05:06.163
One is an apartment house down on Copacabana Beach.

05:09.940 --> 05:16.829
And the other is a modern building, some of the process of construction, up near Petropolis.

05:16.929 --> 05:21.736
Petropolis was the summer residence of the imperial family of the old days.

05:21.796 --> 05:25.281
And she had the topmost point.

05:26.042 --> 05:28.245
Elizabeth said, clouds came in the windows.

05:28.265 --> 05:29.907
Oh, hi.

05:42.087 --> 05:43.889
wife, Hilza, was a novelist.

05:44.630 --> 05:51.859
She wrote under the name of Hilza Gross, and she's got a very, very close friend for those of us.

05:51.879 --> 05:58.007
This is dated Rio, Sunday a.m., May 24, 1953.

06:00.309 --> 06:03.994
It is hot in Rio and heavy, and the heat is covered with

06:09.290 --> 06:17.239
and saw just at the water's edge where the sand was wet what looked like a large glowing coal or the remains of a small fire.

06:17.279 --> 06:23.967
The breakers came right up to it, almost around it, and it throbbed and glowed.

06:24.828 --> 06:28.152
I thought it must be some kind of red phosphorescent jellyfish.

06:29.453 --> 06:38.183
I could stand it no longer and went down 11 floors in the elevator and crossed the street and waited down to the water

06:39.175 --> 06:41.077
and waited down in the water to stand.

06:42.439 --> 06:45.562
Someone had dug a little pit about 18 inches deep.

06:46.504 --> 06:48.666
At the bottom of it, there was a lighted candle.

06:49.968 --> 06:58.678
We don't know whether it was just as quick for someone to watch from an apartment like me to see how high the tide came or something.

06:59.479 --> 07:02.622
Or maybe it was some kind of macumba, woo-doo.

07:03.383 --> 07:05.706
We see them around the outskirts of town.

07:07.964 --> 07:12.751
Usually there was a bottle of wine and a dead chicken and bits of red wool, etc.

07:14.814 --> 07:22.406
The nicest thing I saw on a drive yesterday was a man trying to sell papayas by the roadside.

07:23.027 --> 07:30.177
He had them hung up by strings like a little clothesline and was seated beside them on the ground.

07:30.258 --> 07:37.228
And as each car approached, he raised an old bugle to his mouth, blew a bugle call,

07:37.968 --> 07:45.560
years outside of that, and pointed majestically at the line of big, sagging yellow groups.

07:46.381 --> 07:50.228
I think they are all slightly crazy around here.

07:50.248 --> 07:53.192
The cliche remark about Brazilians.

07:54.074 --> 08:01.866
We stopped to buy orange juice on our trip, and while we bought, the men put a record on an old wind-up

08:11.380 --> 08:21.816
Alcovaccia is just the correct name of Lava's Place, or rather Alcovacina, Little Alcovaccia.

08:21.836 --> 08:26.003
It's named for an album place in Portugal famous for wine meaning high place.

08:27.886 --> 08:30.089
Sometimes we get wine without label.

08:31.171 --> 08:36.058
But Rio is the only address that will reach me for male things.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.784
My Anglo-Semitism is really shocked by the male's

08:41.840 --> 08:48.188
while you are reading Lorna Dune, I've been hearing bad reading Dickens.

08:48.829 --> 08:55.698
I really never had very much, and I polished off Martin Chussell with great expectations, all of a twist, and as U.S.

08:56.239 --> 08:59.664
travels, guaranteed to raise my fever.

09:00.945 --> 09:04.750
How did George Orwell say that Dickens was just being fair?

09:05.591 --> 09:10.598
But then Orwell was never in the United States, and Edward Wilson says he asked if it wasn't

09:13.835 --> 09:21.565
Americans had no separate words for insects, but called them all folks.

09:21.885 --> 09:25.310
Now I'm in a tale of two cities.

09:25.330 --> 09:29.315
It's the energy, the amount Dickens just threw away.

09:29.335 --> 09:32.299
Well, you didn't think all U.S.

09:32.419 --> 09:35.763
people were barbarians, did you?

09:35.783 --> 09:38.847
That cheered me up sometimes after listening to them here.

09:39.488 --> 09:41.231
I think the cliches about the U.S.

09:41.251 --> 09:41.631
are about

09:44.024 --> 09:47.969
Before we know, culturally, oh well, three dots.

09:48.710 --> 09:49.871
And see as the post-script.

09:50.913 --> 09:51.233
P.S.

09:51.313 --> 09:55.378
We have a new maid here named Judith, pronounced .

09:55.499 --> 09:58.282
Elizabeth's name was pronounced .

09:58.502 --> 10:06.893
I keep wanting to ask her to bring in the head, please.

10:10.619 --> 10:12.782
to the same people, mostly to Ilse.

10:12.842 --> 10:14.945
He was really writing to Ilse rather than to kids.

10:16.387 --> 10:22.757
I had my library of what was left of it after having it handed around for 10 years, shipped here, as I have told you.

10:23.418 --> 10:26.722
And between us, I suppose we have about 3,000 books now.

10:27.423 --> 10:28.845
One just has to, really.

10:30.267 --> 10:35.575
Since there isn't much in the way of libraries here, I do get books all the time through.

10:36.316 --> 10:36.897
I do get

10:45.854 --> 10:47.738
and they almost eliminated us here.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.872
But I am working my way through the travel section, and Lana has exhausted all the works on compost.

10:56.297 --> 11:01.228
We have started a correspondence even with a mad woman in England who believes in radiations.

11:01.429 --> 11:02.952
I must tell you more about her.

11:28.413 --> 11:30.316
Indian names, etc.

11:30.897 --> 11:32.941
And they are almost impossibly difficult.

11:33.722 --> 11:37.970
And he has explained a great many words to her that she never knew about before.

11:39.192 --> 11:48.589
On the same trip that we took to Urukwecho, he explains all the place names and so on, things we had tried and tried to find out about and failed.

11:48.629 --> 11:50.252
Of course, he hates the Baroque

11:58.568 --> 12:04.104
when they come to put in gas and water mains, everything's so crooked.

12:04.525 --> 12:12.850
A lot of said, ah-ah, Mr. B. They knew perfectly well they were never going to put in gas and water mains.

12:12.870 --> 12:13.692
But in general,

12:31.036 --> 12:39.797
I did it one rainy day, the first thing I ever wrote right along on a typewriter.

13:06.963 --> 13:09.105
necessary to lay the floor, and so on.

13:10.026 --> 13:11.627
And another letter from you all.

13:12.408 --> 13:15.590
You have no idea what it is to build a house here.

13:16.251 --> 13:20.615
This is Lotta's third, I think maybe fourth, so she's pretty good at it.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.177
But so many things have to be imported.

13:23.277 --> 13:27.160
Everything has to be improvised as you go along, and everything keeps giving out.

13:28.121 --> 13:29.943
This is the first floor to be laid.

13:30.643 --> 13:36.328
We have been living on cement all this time, as I have told you, before the door

13:39.380 --> 14:09.066
very excited to put the mayor to stop and very very kindly arrived with a black goo no more in the top of us I left Lana having a terrific argument with Jose the head workman who looked exactly like a young Ferendel the French comedian our individual cesspool was being installed for Lana's in my own super bathroom

14:09.772 --> 14:22.347
A lot of things, a 15-degree drop in the pipes isn't enough, and with screaming away, I was saying, you know, perfectly well, it's enough to just pee-pee, but not enough for pee-pee and cocoa, too.

14:22.427 --> 14:28.734
That is exactly the way Portuguese and Brazilians talk, and I'm getting quite accustomed to it.

14:28.814 --> 14:35.562
I find that all this frankness makes it much easier to get along with the people than it used to be in New England.

14:38.406 --> 14:39.627
Or am I just getting old

14:50.947 --> 14:52.950
In such a direct way, it was amazing.

14:53.671 --> 15:02.062
And then the contrast, at least as I thought, between traditional Japanese acting and extreme naturalism, three dots.

15:09.412 --> 15:12.456
I'm so sick of retyping my first story.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.798
This is in the village.

15:14.639 --> 15:17.022
And my general agreement is that it's called a masterpiece.

15:18.402 --> 15:22.028
I gave up after long correspondence with the New Yorker last January.

15:22.168 --> 15:27.997
Now I've redone a little, but will concede not another comma for clarity's sake.

15:28.057 --> 15:34.447
And although I know they really want it, if they don't accept immediately, I'm going to send it to Battego's guru.

15:35.829 --> 15:41.878
One tired of typing even a masterpiece, I find.

15:49.857 --> 15:54.742
And the last letter has a little rather interesting background.

15:54.762 --> 15:56.284
It's a letter to a stranger.

15:57.105 --> 16:00.608
And it was sent me by Jimmy Merrill.

16:00.628 --> 16:03.652
All we know is that the recipient was a Miss Pearson.

16:03.672 --> 16:04.893
We don't know what her first name is.

16:05.454 --> 16:07.636
And he said it was handed to him.

16:08.016 --> 16:14.363
He was participating in a, you know, a book signing thing in Amherst.

16:20.620 --> 16:27.867
so I'm interested and he tried to find out where it came from and how the man got it and so on, but he was never going to have a track of that.

16:28.368 --> 16:29.409
But here's the letter.

16:29.429 --> 16:33.533
It was written on May 28, 1975.

16:33.573 --> 16:34.994
She was 64.

16:36.035 --> 16:41.180
And it was a young woman who wanted to be a poet.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.225
And here's a very pragmatic response.

16:46.245 --> 16:49.108
I am answering you because, one, you

16:53.662 --> 16:58.912
Two, you think that poetry assessment groups are a bloody bore.

16:59.814 --> 17:04.083
And although there are exceptions in general, I agree with you completely.

17:04.884 --> 17:12.379
Then in the margins you wrote, but perhaps by three you meant the family poem about one's grandfather or how

17:29.943 --> 17:34.749
forms, which one can use or not as one sees fit.

17:36.211 --> 17:43.681
If you feel you are moralizing too much, just cut the morals off or out.

17:43.701 --> 17:58.600
Quite often, young poets tend to try to tie everything up neatly in two or three beautiful last lines, and it's quite surprising how the poems are improved if the poet can bear to sacrifice those last past beautiful lines.

18:00.149 --> 18:04.316
Your third problem, why shouldn't the poet appear in the poem?

18:06.139 --> 18:07.982
There are several tricks.

18:08.003 --> 18:14.514
I, or we, or he, or she, or one, or somebody's name.

18:15.335 --> 18:17.238
Someone is talking after all.

18:18.380 --> 18:23.389
But of course the idea is to prevent that particular mother voice from growing monotonous.

18:39.029 --> 18:42.274
It all came afterwards, obviously.

18:42.294 --> 18:46.241
And I always ask my writing classes not to read criticism.

18:47.423 --> 18:52.371
I read a lot of poetry all the time and not 20th century poetry.

18:58.160 --> 19:06.133
We can't forget Herbert, Pope, Tennyson, Coleridge, anything at all, almost any good from the past.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.706
until you find out what you really like for yourself.

19:10.908 --> 19:14.792
Even if you try to imitate it exactly, it will come out quite different.

19:17.535 --> 19:30.108
Then the great poets of our own century, Marianne Moore, Gordon, Marlowe Stevens, and not just two or three poems each in anthologies, read all of somebody.

19:31.149 --> 19:35.614
Then read his or her life, and letters, and so on, and by all means,

19:35.965 --> 19:39.312
read pieces, letters, then see what happens.

19:40.235 --> 19:41.537
That's really all I can say.

19:42.339 --> 19:49.074
It can't be done, apparently, by willpower and study alone, or by being, quote, with it.

19:50.277 --> 19:52.101
But I just don't know how politically

20:29.695 --> 20:41.210
I'm going to read several poems.

20:42.852 --> 20:45.956
The first is First Death of Nova Scotia.

20:52.204 --> 20:58.993
In a cold, cold parlor, my mother laid out Arthur beneath the chromographs.

20:59.817 --> 21:06.347
Edward, Prince of Wales, with Princess Alexandra, and King George, with Queen Mary.

21:07.348 --> 21:16.522
Below them, on the table, stood a stuffed loon, shocked and stuffed by Uncle Arthur, Arthur's father.

21:17.844 --> 21:24.534
Since Uncle Arthur fired a bullet into him, he hadn't said a word.

21:25.796 --> 21:29.301
He kept his own counsel on his white

21:29.467 --> 21:32.530
frozen lake, the marble-topped table.

21:33.431 --> 21:38.655
His breast was deep and white, cold and caressable.

21:39.536 --> 21:44.421
His arms were red glass, much to be desired.

21:45.562 --> 21:53.789
Come, says my mother, come and say goodbye to your little cousin Arthur.

21:53.809 --> 21:58.073
I was lifted up and given one lily of the valley

21:58.306 --> 22:00.288
who put in Arthur's hand.

22:01.330 --> 22:11.623
Arthur's caution was a little frozen cake, frosted cake, and a red-eyed moon idol from his white, frozen lake.

22:13.225 --> 22:15.507
Arthur was very small.

22:16.469 --> 22:20.634
He was all white, like a doll that hadn't been painted yet.

22:21.555 --> 22:27.182
Jack Frost had started bettering him the way he always painted the maple leaf.

22:27.854 --> 22:29.336
forever.

22:29.356 --> 22:41.292
He had dust begun on his hair, a few red strokes, and then Jack Frost had dropped the brush and left him white forever.

22:41.312 --> 22:46.158
The gracious, royal couples were warm in red and ermine.

22:46.999 --> 22:52.506
Their feet were well wrapped up in the ladies' ermine train.

22:52.526 --> 22:56.832
They invited Arthur to being the smallest page at court.

22:58.010 --> 23:10.106
But how could Arthur go, clutching his tiny lily with his eyes shut up so tight and the roads deep in snow?

23:15.173 --> 23:17.776
These poems vary marvelously in tone.

23:18.377 --> 23:20.039
This is a very different type of poem.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.262
Love lies sleeping.

23:26.849 --> 23:56.383
earliest morning switching all the tracks that cross the sky from cinder star to star coupling the ends of streets to trains of light now draw us into daylight in our bed and clear away what stresses on the brain put out the neon shapes that float and swell and glare down the gray avenue between the eyes in pinks and yellows

23:56.667 --> 24:04.054
letters and twitching signs, tan over moons, wane, wane.

24:04.815 --> 24:25.695
From the window I see an immense city, carefully revealed, made delicate by overworkmanship, detail upon detail, cornice upon facade, reaching so languidly up into a weak white sky, it seems to waver there.

24:26.857 --> 24:30.641
where it will slowly groan in skies of water glass.

24:31.301 --> 24:43.814
From fused beads of iron and copper crystals, the little chemical garden in a jar trembles and spans again, pale blue, blueberry, and breaks.

24:45.095 --> 24:47.558
The stars hurriedly begin their play.

24:48.078 --> 24:52.643
Then, in the west, boom, and a cloud of smoke.

24:52.663 --> 24:53.083
Boom.

24:53.452 --> 24:56.856
and with floating ball the blossom blooms again.

24:56.896 --> 25:12.413
And all the employees who work in plants where such a sound says, danger, or once said, death, turn in their sleep and feel the short hairs bristling on backs and necks.

25:12.433 --> 25:18.000
The cloud of smoke moves off, a shirt is taken off a thread like clothesline.

25:18.780 --> 25:22.024
Along the streets below, the water wagon comes,

25:22.342 --> 25:27.147
throwing its hissing snowy fan across key rings and newspapers.

25:27.888 --> 25:33.955
The water-dry, light-dry, dark-wet, the pattern of the cool watermelon.

25:35.037 --> 25:51.235
I hear the day-springs of the morning strikes from stony walls and halls and iron beds, scattered with root cascades, alarmed for the expected, queer cupids of all persons blowing up

25:51.569 --> 25:54.552
whose evening meals they will prepare all day.

25:55.273 --> 26:00.760
You will dine well on his heart, on his and his.

26:01.520 --> 26:08.388
So send them about your business affectionately, dragging in the streets their unique love.

26:09.449 --> 26:11.432
Scourge them with rose and only.

26:11.472 --> 26:20.462
Be like the helium, for all wait to one or several morning comes, who is good.

26:20.712 --> 26:33.367
has fallen over the edge of his bed, whose face is turned so that the image of the city grows down into his open eye, inverted and distorted.

26:34.629 --> 26:41.337
No, I mean distorted and revealed, if perceived at all.

26:48.978 --> 26:53.305
This column is entitled Four Columns, and it's four points together.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.115
Marian's Earring and Our Love and Voice of History.

27:02.138 --> 27:03.320
One Conversation.

27:05.343 --> 27:14.477
The tumult in the heart keeps asking questions, and then it stops and undertakes to answer in the same tone of voice.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.061
No one could tell the difference.

27:18.138 --> 27:25.609
Uninnocent these conversations start and then engage the senses only half meaning to.

27:26.450 --> 27:28.172
And then there is no point.

27:29.254 --> 27:31.057
And then there is no sense.

27:32.118 --> 27:36.725
Until a name and all its connotations are the same.

27:38.888 --> 27:41.091
To ring towards morning.

27:42.513 --> 27:43.875
The great light

27:44.142 --> 27:57.238
The cage has broken up in the air, freeing, I think, about a million birds whose wild ascending shadows will not be back, and all the wires come falling down.

27:58.059 --> 28:02.946
No cage, no frightening birds, the rain is brightening now.

28:03.687 --> 28:12.057
The fate is pale, the tribes, the puzzle of their prudence, and solved it with an unexpected kiss.

28:12.526 --> 28:19.336
whose freckled, unprespected hands are lit.

28:19.356 --> 28:19.696
3.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.260
While someone telephones.

28:25.905 --> 28:32.334
Wasted, wasted minutes that couldn't be worth minutes of a barbaric condescension.

28:33.275 --> 28:41.166
There out the bathroom window at the fir trees at their dark needles, increasing to no purpose, wouldn't be crystallized.

28:41.433 --> 28:44.797
and where two fireflies are only lost.

28:45.659 --> 28:51.206
Here nothing but a train that goes by, must go by, like tension.

28:51.987 --> 28:53.429
Nothing.

28:53.449 --> 28:54.991
And we wait.

28:55.011 --> 29:02.881
Maybe even now, these minutes host emerging some relaxed, uncondescending stranger.

29:03.522 --> 29:04.523
The heart leaps.

29:05.485 --> 29:11.052
And while the fireflies are failing to illuminate these nightmare trees,

29:11.437 --> 29:15.681
might say not being his green, gay eyes.

29:18.304 --> 29:21.767
Oh, oh, breath.

29:21.787 --> 29:40.465
Beneath that loved and celebrated breath, silent, poor, really, blindly vain, grieves, maybe, lives and lets live, passes, sets, hoping movies, but inevitably.

29:40.985 --> 29:48.136
And with what clamor, why restrained, I cannot fathom even a ripple.

29:48.156 --> 29:59.172
See the fins flying of nine black hairs, four around one, five the other little, flying almost intolerably on your own breath.

30:00.474 --> 30:01.015
Equivocal.

30:01.796 --> 30:09.287
But what we have in common bound to be there, whatever we must own equivalence for,

30:09.976 --> 30:25.274
Something that maybe I could bargain with and make a separate piece beneath, within, if never with.

30:25.294 --> 30:32.122
I'll end with a familiar social prose poem called 12 o'clock news, and it's the landscape of your desktop.

30:33.844 --> 30:38.650
Well, you have to imagine it's kind of old-fashioned desktop, like where there

30:39.288 --> 30:44.173
Gooseneck Lamp, ink bottle and an old fashioned eraser that had that needle under through.

30:45.574 --> 30:48.577
12 o'clock noon, Gooseneck Lamp.

30:49.658 --> 30:54.082
As you all know, tonight is the night of the full moon, half the world over.

30:54.883 --> 30:58.326
But here the moon seems to hang motionless in the sky.

30:58.907 --> 31:00.248
It gives very little light.

31:00.809 --> 31:01.690
It could be dense.

31:02.390 --> 31:03.632
Visibility is poor.

31:04.372 --> 31:09.177
Nevertheless, we shall try to give you some idea of the lay of the land as the present situation.

31:10.557 --> 31:25.397
The escarpment that rises abruptly from the central plain is in heavy shadow, but the elaborate terracing of its southern places gleams faintly in a grim light like fish-tail.

31:26.378 --> 31:31.966
What endless labor those small, peculiarly shaped terraces represent?

31:31.986 --> 31:37.233
And yet, on them, the welfare of this tiny principality depends.

31:37.874 --> 31:40.497
A pile of manuscripts

31:41.573 --> 31:47.301
A slight landslide occurred in the northwest about an hour ago.

31:47.521 --> 31:57.255
The exposed soil appeared to be of poor quality, almost white, calcareous, but staleous.

31:57.275 --> 31:58.857
There are believed to have been no casualties.

32:00.700 --> 32:01.401
Tight sheet.

32:02.743 --> 32:09.252
Almost due north, our aerial reconnaissance reports the discovery of a large rectangular field.

32:09.485 --> 32:14.371
Unknown to us, obviously man-made, it is dark echoed.

32:15.312 --> 32:20.219
And there's a place, a cemetery, an envelope.

32:21.420 --> 32:32.214
In this small, backward country, one of the most backward left in the world today, communications are crude and industrialization and its products almost non-existent.

32:32.935 --> 32:37.821
Things to say, however, sign boards are on a truly gigantic scale.

32:38.830 --> 32:49.321
We have also received reports of a mysterious, oddly-shaped black structure at an undisclosed distance to the east.

32:49.341 --> 32:55.907
Its presence was revealed only because its highly polished surface touches such feeble moonlight as prevails.

32:56.668 --> 33:00.572
The natural resources of this country seem far from completely known to us.

33:01.033 --> 33:08.280
There is the possibility that this may be or may contain some powerful and horrifying secret weapon.

33:08.750 --> 33:35.205
On the other hand, given what we do know or have learned from our anthropologists and sociologists about this people, it may well be nothing more than a new man or great altar recently erected to one of their gods, to which, in their presence, the start of a state of superstition and hopelessness may attribute magical powers and may even regard as a savior one last hope of rescue from their grave difficulty.

33:36.827 --> 33:37.828
Typewriter is great, sir.

33:38.332 --> 33:42.516
At last, one of the elusive natives has been spotted.

33:43.617 --> 33:56.650
He appears to be, rather to have been, a unicyclist courier, who may have met his end by falling from the height of the escorts because of the deceptive illumination.

33:57.491 --> 34:07.140
Alive, he would have been small, but undoubtedly proud and erect, with the thick, briskly black hair typical of the Indian,

34:08.572 --> 34:09.233
Ashtray.

34:10.294 --> 34:19.003
From our superior vantage point, we can clearly see into a sort of dugout, possibly a shell crater, a nest of soldiers.

34:19.023 --> 34:25.230
They line heaped together, wearing the camouflage battle dress intended for winter warfare.

34:25.971 --> 34:30.476
They are in immediately contorted positions, all dead.

34:31.597 --> 34:34.140
We can make out an ace body.

34:34.762 --> 34:40.348
These uniforms were designed to be used in guerrilla warfare on the country's warm, snow-covered mountain peaks.

34:41.049 --> 35:00.752
The fact that these poor soldiers are wearing them here on the plain gives further proof, if proof were necessary, either of the childishness and hopeless impracticality of this inscrutable people, our opponent, or of the bad corruption of their leaders.

35:30.955 --> 35:52.864
I'm going to read two passages.

35:52.884 --> 35:59.933
One, an excerpt from a letter, one paragraph, and a long poem of the movie.

36:05.920 --> 36:19.995
They're very ambitious and even emotionally draining, remarkably candid letters in the book.

36:20.015 --> 36:25.561
But the excerpt I'm going to read is funny.

36:26.562 --> 36:35.472
But it suggests the element that I think one feels constantly to these letters of how she

36:36.633 --> 36:52.615
create these very short, often short, vivid portraits that are funny and suggest a whole world of experiences on her part and of irony about herself.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.900
So this is the letter.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.303
It's from a letter to Robert Lowe, April 26, 1960.

36:58.363 --> 37:05.914
Next week, I'm going on another short trip, three or four days.

37:06.383 --> 37:10.829
down the coast to a place that one can only get you by boat.

37:11.831 --> 37:14.314
So no one ever goes, of course.

37:14.334 --> 37:16.918
It's supposed to be perfect in two century timing.

37:17.459 --> 37:21.885
And the time comes up the streets every day and goes down again, no hotel.

37:23.467 --> 37:27.613
Lotta refuses to have anything to do with anything resilient or primitive, you know.

37:27.633 --> 37:32.940
She said she wants something more civilized rather than less when she goes sadly.

37:34.102 --> 37:36.205
So I'm going with two neighbors

37:37.332 --> 37:40.115
One is the father of a childhood friend of Lada's.

37:40.735 --> 37:41.696
He's almost 80.

37:42.597 --> 37:47.482
And the other is his boyfriend of over 40 years, who's about 65.

37:48.383 --> 37:59.074
A huge, Viking-like German with a brain and soul of a small girl of eight.

37:59.134 --> 38:01.456
Really, kind of see William should come here.

38:02.337 --> 38:07.002
But please don't suggest it.

38:09.445 --> 38:10.627
They are amazing, however.

38:11.688 --> 38:13.711
Never a cross word in all these years.

38:14.411 --> 38:16.394
And they are ten times my answer.

38:16.775 --> 38:18.597
And are stupid as stupid.

38:18.717 --> 38:21.340
And will make a lovely trio.

38:25.105 --> 38:30.092
The book is full of that kind of sort of pleasure on the run, in passing.

38:30.412 --> 38:32.996
I don't think that couple ever shows up again in the book.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.061
This is the moose.

38:38.082 --> 38:38.743
For gracious

38:39.196 --> 38:40.257
Boomer's Valley.

38:45.862 --> 38:58.334
From narrow provinces of fish and bread and tea, home of the long tide, where the bay leaves the sea twice a day and takes the herring to long rise.

38:59.856 --> 39:07.583
Where the river enters or retreats in a wall of brown tones, the paradise that meets the bay coming in,

39:08.238 --> 39:09.440
The bay not at home.

39:11.062 --> 39:12.384
Where's tilted red.

39:12.925 --> 39:16.690
Sometimes the sun sets facing a red sea.

39:16.710 --> 39:17.170
And others.

39:18.192 --> 39:18.773
Veins.

39:19.133 --> 39:21.577
The flat lavender rich mud.

39:22.278 --> 39:25.442
In burning rigolus.

39:25.462 --> 39:26.764
A red gravelly rose.

39:27.645 --> 39:29.508
Down rose of sugar naples.

39:29.928 --> 39:32.312
Past clattered fawn houses and naples.

39:32.712 --> 39:33.613
Clattered churches.

39:34.755 --> 39:35.156
Bleached.

39:35.817 --> 39:36.878
Rich to squam shells.

39:38.545 --> 39:40.107
past twenty silver birches.

39:41.508 --> 39:55.061
Through late afternoon, a bus journeyed west, the windshield flashing pink, a pink glancing off of metal, brushing the feathers like a blue bee-duck enamel.

39:56.402 --> 40:07.253
Down hollows, up rises, and awake patience, while a lone traveler gives kisses and embraces to seven relatives

40:08.431 --> 40:11.594
and a collie supervises.

40:11.614 --> 40:16.979
Goodbye to the elms, to the farm, to the dogs, to our stars.

40:18.220 --> 40:20.162
The light grows richer.

40:21.403 --> 40:26.527
The fog, shifting, salty, thin, comes closing in.

40:28.069 --> 40:36.196
As cold, round crystals form, its lines settle in the white hen's feathers, in gray, gray as cabbages.

40:36.997 --> 40:38.218
On the cabbage roses,

40:38.992 --> 40:41.795
The lupins like a foxhole.

40:41.815 --> 40:46.859
The sweet peas cling to their wet, white stream on the whitewashed hensi.

40:48.340 --> 40:55.146
Bumblebees creep inside the foxholes, and evening commences.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.548
One stop at Bass River.

40:57.549 --> 41:01.172
Then the economy, lower, middle, upper.

41:02.193 --> 41:08.138
Five islands, five houses, where a woman shakes the tablecloth out at the supper

41:09.350 --> 41:11.873
Hail, winter, gone.

41:13.195 --> 41:17.140
The tantrum on marshes, and the smell of salt haze.

41:18.541 --> 41:26.491
An iron bridge trembles, and a loose length plank rattles, but doesn't get wet.

41:26.511 --> 41:30.015
On the left, a red light swims to the dark.

41:31.017 --> 41:37.905
A ship port lantern, two rubber boots show, illuminated foam.

41:39.404 --> 41:40.846
The dog gives one bark.

41:42.868 --> 41:48.554
A woman climbed in with two markets at it, brisk, freckled, elderly.

41:49.756 --> 41:52.739
A girl, you know, yes, sir, all the way to Boston.

41:54.021 --> 41:58.125
She regards him amicably.

41:58.145 --> 42:06.795
Moonlight, as we entered a new brunch with woods, hairy, scratchy, splintery, moonlighting mist caught in them

42:07.231 --> 42:10.835
like lambswool on bushes in a pasture.

42:12.677 --> 42:19.745
The passengers fly back, snoring, some long sighs.

42:21.988 --> 42:27.233
A dreamy delegation begins in the night.

42:27.253 --> 42:32.479
A gentle, auditory, slow hallucination.

42:34.181 --> 42:35.803
In the creaking, the noises

42:37.066 --> 42:43.232
An old conversation, not concerning us, but recognizable somewhere back in the bus.

42:45.054 --> 42:51.900
Strategy on the voices, talking interruptively, talking in eternity.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.845
Names being mentioned, things cleared out finally.

42:57.966 --> 43:03.111
What he said, what she said, who got attention?

43:04.632 --> 43:04.772
Death.

43:04.792 --> 43:05.773
Death and sickness.

43:07.357 --> 43:08.779
The year she remarried.

43:09.740 --> 43:13.705
The year something happened.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.827
She died in childhood.

43:16.269 --> 43:18.652
That was the sun walked in the schooner's office.

43:19.854 --> 43:20.875
He took to drink.

43:22.257 --> 43:22.577
Yes.

43:23.899 --> 43:24.860
She went to the bath.

43:26.062 --> 43:30.728
When Amos began to pray, even in the store, and finally the family had to put him away.

43:33.031 --> 43:34.413
Yes.

43:34.453 --> 43:35.895
That peculiar affirmation is

43:36.955 --> 43:38.917
Yes.

43:38.937 --> 43:40.078
Short, indrawn breath.

43:40.518 --> 43:44.001
Half grown, half accepted.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.782
The knee, like that.

43:46.843 --> 43:47.584
We know it.

43:49.105 --> 43:51.768
Off of death.

43:51.788 --> 43:53.069
Talking, the way they talk.

43:53.569 --> 43:57.072
In the old feathered edge, peacefully.

43:57.232 --> 43:57.993
On, gnawing.

43:59.234 --> 44:00.535
Getting a lamp light in the hall.

44:01.856 --> 44:04.158
Down the kitchen, the dog tucked through the shoulder.

44:05.919 --> 44:06.540
Now,

44:07.887 --> 44:11.833
It's all right now, even as long as sleep.

44:11.853 --> 44:13.655
Just as on all those turns.

44:15.618 --> 44:20.585
Suddenly, the bike rider stops with a jolt that turns off his light.

44:22.868 --> 44:26.593
A moose has come out of the impenetrable wood.

44:27.995 --> 44:32.902
It stands there, rooms rather, in the middle of the road.

44:34.404 --> 44:35.045
It approaches.

44:36.447 --> 44:37.168
It sniffs.

44:37.537 --> 44:43.604
At the bus is hot, hood, powerfully and rearly.

44:44.886 --> 44:50.913
High at the church, homely at the house, or face at the house.

44:52.595 --> 44:55.758
The main force is sure to perfectly harmonize.

44:57.460 --> 45:05.029
Some of the passengers exclaim and whisper, childishly, softly, sure are some creatures.

45:06.578 --> 45:07.840
It's awful, horny.

45:10.584 --> 45:15.370
But it's a she.

45:15.490 --> 45:18.274
Taking the time, she looks the butt over.

45:19.416 --> 45:25.865
Grand of the world, please.

45:25.885 --> 45:30.812
Why do we feel, we all feel, the sweet sensation of joy?

45:33.536 --> 45:34.577
Curious creatures,

45:35.114 --> 45:37.697
is our quiet driver's rolling door.

45:39.419 --> 45:40.461
Look at that, will you?

45:42.183 --> 45:43.124
And he shifts gears.

45:44.346 --> 45:50.874
For a moment longer, by craning backwards, the moose can be seen on the moonlit macadam.

45:52.536 --> 46:00.907
Then there's a dim smell of moose, an acrid smell of gasoline.

46:02.649 --> 46:03.450
Thank you.

46:18.213 --> 46:25.121
For this wonderful book of letters, I was just thinking there probably will not be another like this.

46:25.941 --> 46:35.132
I mean, there won't be one again, but I don't think this number of letters will be written by anybody.

46:37.494 --> 46:44.642
It's partly the telephone, it's partly other things, but in reading in those suspicious letters,

46:44.842 --> 46:54.594
people who have received them over the years, they all knew what a treasure they were, and that they weren't going to receive anything like this from anyone else.

46:55.275 --> 47:05.107
But of course, she was a traveler, and that caught one to write letters, but partly away from home and away from your old roots.

47:05.628 --> 47:14.359
But you're seeing new things all the time, which interest you, and therefore you have something to say.

47:14.744 --> 47:22.613
For a recipient sitting at home, his letters or her letters in reply always start, nothing new here.

47:23.414 --> 47:28.260
Which is true, but there's always something new on the road.

47:28.280 --> 47:32.445
I'm just going to read very short little shippersprunk letters.

47:32.645 --> 47:42.557
They're all to Mary and Moore, and they're all about fish or animals or something like that.

47:43.128 --> 47:47.452
It seems to me I'm thinking of this, I think, especially early on.

47:48.353 --> 47:57.143
Perhaps she wrote to Miss Moore rather deliberately finding the animal and the fish things.

47:58.023 --> 48:01.247
Alyssa Bishop's interested.

48:01.267 --> 48:05.331
I don't think Mary Hadmore ever went fishing.

48:05.351 --> 48:06.733
I can't imagine that she did.

48:07.173 --> 48:12.038
And I rather doubt that she ever had a dog or a cat.

48:12.406 --> 48:25.319
Her interest, Elizabeth mostly, in her points in her letters are acute, direct observation, but of course it's the observation of a special imagination.

48:25.900 --> 48:36.251
And Mary Ann Moore, wonderful in a very different way, had a kind of National Geographic policy of exotica and so on.

48:36.791 --> 48:42.177
Well, here are just a few little dogs and cats and fish

48:42.747 --> 48:43.828
to Ms.

48:43.848 --> 48:44.449
Moore.

48:45.129 --> 48:45.550
Let's see.

48:46.170 --> 48:47.171
Here's the first one.

48:47.592 --> 48:55.139
It's from Florida, 1937, 50 years ago almost.

48:56.980 --> 49:05.368
The other day, the other day I caught a bullfish who began to puff up as I pulled him in.

49:05.388 --> 49:09.632
Three pelletons immediately rushed over, building up

49:10.827 --> 49:21.365
holding up their tremendous bill, and my chap, the blowfish, who was just mad, okay, is that all right?

49:21.385 --> 49:26.794
Now I'll throw it right into one's mouth, into one of the pelican's mouth, I guess.

49:27.517 --> 49:41.434
At that time, most of Rome was as big as a large size balloon, and a poor skeleton was very puzzled as to what to do with him.

49:41.454 --> 49:45.059
He piled off with the other two after him.

49:45.079 --> 49:47.702
Then he dropped the fish and another snap stick.

49:47.935 --> 49:51.901
They kept it up to play a pile like a basketball game.

49:51.981 --> 49:58.771
The fish was clever enough to keep blown up all the time.

49:58.991 --> 50:05.380
Finally, he chose the right moment, deflated, disappeared in a week.

50:06.001 --> 50:10.347
The telecons turned back to watch our lives again.

50:10.988 --> 50:16.997
Most of them telecons had brown and brown heads, but once in a while,

50:17.230 --> 50:22.077
You see what looks like a fine wig of rough-eyed black.

50:22.658 --> 50:25.982
That's a kind of old thing.

50:26.002 --> 50:28.446
Now this is written shortly after.

50:29.848 --> 50:43.086
Here now, I think she knew this would interest Mary Ann Moore, because Mary Ann Moore could not possibly have had such an experience, which is this.

50:43.893 --> 50:52.962
The purpose of my trip to Fort Myers was to see Ralph Allen wrestle with his... I have to get you.

50:53.143 --> 50:57.267
I suspect I wouldn't be up to that myself.

50:57.287 --> 51:05.035
I also had to give a lecture and exhibit of Smith.

51:05.295 --> 51:07.878
I still wish you had seen it, Ms.

51:08.018 --> 51:08.459
Moore.

51:08.479 --> 51:10.761
I'm so sure you would have liked it.

51:11.112 --> 51:15.237
He had two tremendous diamondback rattlers.

51:15.998 --> 51:22.687
They cocked balloons with their fangs, and you could see the venom springing out.

51:23.027 --> 51:24.509
It was in a floodlight.

51:25.050 --> 51:31.318
Then he exerted venom in a cocktail glass and put it on a little white table.

51:32.279 --> 51:36.024
The rattling sound was like a sawing machine.

51:36.044 --> 51:38.267
He had some other beautiful snakes,

51:38.602 --> 51:41.067
especially one called chicken snake.

51:41.808 --> 51:51.628
The hole that was called snake is too small to exhibit.

51:52.229 --> 51:57.640
But I have seen some lovely ones and some puff adders.

51:58.042 --> 52:07.112
Did you know when the pump rider plays dead and rolls on his back, a little blood comes prickling out of his mouth?

52:08.133 --> 52:16.022
Now that then poor Mr. Allen, who she had been living on, she was making this, what do you call, social calls to the alligators.

52:16.042 --> 52:20.767
It's time to, like birds calls, time to imitate what an alligator does.

52:21.488 --> 52:23.049
And so they respond.

52:23.990 --> 52:26.513
Now let me see, where are we now?

52:27.573 --> 52:36.487
All right, here's her two calves, who is rather famous in his family, became rather famous in her letters.

52:36.508 --> 52:43.279
This is from Rio, some years later, actually, in Los Angeles.

52:43.299 --> 52:51.572
The most extraordinary people, she turned out here, I don't know why, but she said, Lata, that's her friend,

52:52.126 --> 52:57.612
Lata has sold one of her places to a famous Polish moon man.

52:58.212 --> 53:04.198
Now what he's doing down there is Patroclus out right here, I don't know, but there he is.

53:04.218 --> 53:15.230
And you just have to drive down the mountainside for two minutes to see a black jaguar, a camel, and the most beautiful bullets in the world.

53:16.091 --> 53:19.534
I think of you, Mr. Miss Morley, on every minute view,

53:20.054 --> 53:21.476
The zoo man.

53:21.496 --> 53:23.859
I can't believe this myself.

53:25.060 --> 53:26.522
We have no common language.

53:26.682 --> 53:29.225
Stay near Toucan for my birthday.

53:29.626 --> 53:48.930
He or she, the Toucan, is barely tame and mischievous, brought coins around the room, brought off with a toast at breakfast, black with electric blue eyes, with blue and yellow marked beak, blue feet, and red feathers.

53:50.395 --> 53:58.550
Uh, here and there, the feathers, she says, she writes, Mount under the frame like a sunset.

53:59.792 --> 54:05.121
Okay, I didn't like the frame as Uncle Sam.

54:05.141 --> 54:08.828
So I'll read Uncle Sam up here again.

54:08.848 --> 54:11.613
All right.

54:12.835 --> 54:14.378
Just a little more.

54:17.075 --> 54:23.301
It must have been the whole time trying to find what I'm doing here.

54:24.562 --> 54:24.722
OK.

54:25.123 --> 54:26.824
Yeah, some days it took him time.

54:27.625 --> 54:30.228
A neighbor built him a very large cage.

54:30.448 --> 54:32.790
It's hard to both see it.

54:32.890 --> 54:37.695
A neighbor built him a very large cage in which he's quite happy.

54:38.736 --> 54:40.758
I did him back to the garden hose.

54:41.498 --> 54:45.242
Someone also bought him a pair of big

54:45.340 --> 55:10.622
He has two marriages, one a sort of low rival and he's quite gentle if he's clean or cranky, the other that I must admit is a shriek.

55:12.020 --> 55:17.068
Family.

55:18.310 --> 55:22.896
Just maybe one more.

55:22.977 --> 55:25.641
Where am I?

55:25.921 --> 55:30.468
Oh, these little cards keep falling out.

55:30.508 --> 55:36.818
Oh, it's a cat and a man who can.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.782
Family has flown things for cats.

55:40.353 --> 55:43.637
It's named The Cat Cavalier.

55:43.657 --> 55:47.182
It's a beauty and so good and hardworking.

55:47.422 --> 55:52.529
I have no idea what you're doing.

55:52.549 --> 55:55.093
Maybe he's eating all those lizards.

55:55.734 --> 55:59.559
So good and hardworking.

55:59.579 --> 56:03.644
We couldn't keep house without him.

56:04.666 --> 56:09.432
One night he started, one night it started to pull off.

56:09.800 --> 56:14.866
that Mr. Ray was using, and I'd forgotten to put the cover on time to hold.

56:15.547 --> 56:29.003
I watched out, and he would stand straight up like a stick, with his beak pointing to heaven, and his eyes shut tight, and the water falling down on him.

56:29.023 --> 56:33.508
I was just told that he could make himself go home.

56:33.588 --> 56:36.972
I suppose it was a fantastic trip.

56:37.508 --> 56:45.139
but he looked exactly like Van Custenburg's bike.

57:14.279 --> 57:22.740
I'd like to read two poems about Greenville and a letter from Greenville.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.745
The first poem is about...
