00:02.258 --> 00:05.803
Could you just, for the sake of my tape, tell me your complete name?

00:05.823 --> 00:10.631
Alright, my name is Alice, middle initial M, last name Laurent.

00:11.071 --> 00:15.098
And that's spelled L-O-R-E-N-T-H.

00:15.438 --> 00:18.122
I'm going to give you a comment card.

00:19.084 --> 00:24.853
And my title is Head of Special Collections and Fine Arts Music.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.777
And this is an

00:28.364 --> 00:41.162
And right now, you are in special collections, which is really known as the John Griswold White Collection of Folklore, Orientalia, and Chess.

00:41.182 --> 00:44.947
This is the world's largest library in chess.

00:44.987 --> 00:45.948
But how did that happen?

00:45.968 --> 00:57.544
Well, Mr. White, whose portrait is right there on the wall, was a book collector in the bibliophile and the chess aficionado.

00:58.148 --> 01:15.814
And very early in his life as a Jungian, in, oh, I would say around 1867, he set out to buy every book ever published or having anything to do with chess in any language.

01:16.655 --> 01:22.865
Chess being a game, it sparked manners and customs, folklore, so he got into that area.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.852
And then when America had

01:28.591 --> 01:35.162
his problems with the Philippines, he sent his secretary over to the library, put a book on the Philippines.

01:36.063 --> 01:49.344
He couldn't find any, and he decided that he is going to provide the library with research and reference materials on the non-Western cultures.

01:49.364 --> 01:52.530
So that's where William Talia comes into that picture.

01:52.730 --> 01:54.132
And this is all the same man again.

01:54.393 --> 01:55.915
And it's the same man.

01:56.215 --> 02:12.242
And from that time on, until his death in 1928, he has personally selected and purchased about 50,000 volumes in orientalian chess.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.446
I mean orientalian folklore.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.493
His chess and checker books he kept at his house.

02:19.300 --> 02:28.249
and they led it to the library when he died, and they amounted to about twelve thousand.

02:29.571 --> 02:31.352
Twelve thousand?

02:31.392 --> 02:31.833
Twelve thousand.

02:31.853 --> 02:32.373
Twelve thousand.

02:32.393 --> 02:32.734
Twelve thousand.

02:32.754 --> 02:33.575
Any incunables?

02:33.675 --> 02:34.716
Oh, yes.

02:34.956 --> 02:46.708
There's about seven or eight incunables, and some of them are, of course, on chess, and some of them are unique, and some of them are not that unique.

02:47.380 --> 02:57.710
but they have some beautiful oriental manuscripts, especially in Arabic and Persian, which are very important.

02:59.411 --> 03:16.527
And the collection has around 180,000 volumes, the white collections, and it includes over 7,000 languages in dialects, I mean materials in 7,000 languages in dialects.

03:17.603 --> 03:20.307
It is completely catalogued.

03:24.212 --> 03:31.823
Many of our oriental language books are not online because of the problem of translation.

03:31.863 --> 03:39.173
By that I mean that the library community has not decided on everything.

03:39.946 --> 03:42.249
transliteration problem.

03:42.269 --> 03:55.625
Now, like Arabic is decided, Chinese, Japanese is decided, but there are many other languages which have not been tackled, and they can't go on on OCS yet.

03:55.645 --> 04:00.430
But like a few years ago, we started to add all our Tibetan material.

04:02.333 --> 04:08.400
Now, when Mr. White died, he established the John G. White Trust Fund.

04:08.802 --> 04:21.336
and we still have the trust fund, and we still use its income for purchases of books and materials.

04:21.356 --> 04:23.859
What kinds of areas are you buying in?

04:24.019 --> 04:26.321
What kinds of areas are you acquiring in?

04:26.481 --> 04:38.775
We are acquiring in Oriental studies up to the—it differs in the Oriental countries.

04:39.059 --> 04:52.498
Up to the predominance of Western influence, which means that in Japan, for example, we will stop after Commodore Parish time, you know.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.125
And in China, it goes a little bit further.

04:58.767 --> 05:05.296
In Arabic countries, it may stop at the end of the 18th century and so on and so forth.

05:05.316 --> 05:08.661
In folklore, it's totally international.

05:09.181 --> 05:19.533
We do not buy popular books pertaining to Canadian, American, and English folklore.

05:19.633 --> 05:38.496
We feel that those areas should be well developed by the other departments of the library, but we do buy the research materials, and we do buy reference materials, and we really have very extensive holdings.

05:38.645 --> 05:44.474
As a matter of fact, our Foucourt catalog has been published in 73 volumes.

05:44.494 --> 05:44.754
Really?

05:44.935 --> 05:45.535
I don't get it.

05:45.555 --> 05:46.016
73 volumes.

05:46.417 --> 05:46.717
No.

05:46.837 --> 05:50.503
Is this all part of the library out here, by the way, or what are these buildings there?

05:51.124 --> 05:51.264
No.

05:51.404 --> 05:55.911
That is the Cleveland Board of Education.

05:55.931 --> 05:56.552
I see.

05:56.572 --> 06:05.766
Behind there, there is the public auditorium where you can have conventions or some theatrical productions.

06:06.455 --> 06:17.408
But all of these buildings you see here have been a part of what used to be known as the Cleveland Mall plan.

06:17.428 --> 06:17.749
I see.

06:17.949 --> 06:23.516
So that's why you have the same height and sort of the... It looks like Washington, D.C.

06:23.616 --> 06:24.957
in some respects.

06:24.978 --> 06:28.562
You know, they have the mall and the... Yeah.

06:28.582 --> 06:28.682
Yeah.

06:29.759 --> 06:32.644
in the library as an institution.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.429
I guess it's one of the largest public libraries in America.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.153
And its role in, you know, Cleveland.

06:38.193 --> 06:38.894
Why Cleveland?

06:38.954 --> 06:42.080
Why does Cleveland have such a wonderful library?

06:42.781 --> 06:47.950
Here we have over three million catalog monographs in this library.

06:47.990 --> 06:56.003
I don't really know the extent, if you add all the materials together.

06:56.523 --> 06:58.386
But why Cleveland?

06:59.367 --> 07:02.752
Don't forget, Cleveland was a very rich town.

07:03.694 --> 07:09.763
It has a very rich New England and European heritage.

07:11.866 --> 07:15.532
The library is 125 years old.

07:16.072 --> 07:20.159
They started it literally, you see, the collection.

07:21.060 --> 07:25.787
And for the same reason why do we have such a wonderful

07:26.324 --> 07:31.452
art museums, Cleveland Museum of Art is European.

07:31.472 --> 07:38.643
And I would say it's among the three leading American art museums that there are.

07:38.944 --> 07:42.068
And why do we have the Cleveland Orchestra?

07:42.649 --> 07:45.053
Same reason.

07:45.113 --> 07:52.845
George Fell, Christoph von Dochnany, it's that again, a world famous orchestra.

07:52.865 --> 07:54.728
Cleveland has

07:55.653 --> 08:04.501
I wrote it in one of my articles, that in the 19th century, there were quite a few polymets.

08:04.521 --> 08:05.682
Did you write an article on this?

08:06.462 --> 08:08.664
Yeah, I've written quite a few articles.

08:08.684 --> 08:10.406
Could I get copies of these?

08:10.426 --> 08:14.349
Yeah, yeah, sure, but in which area interest you?

08:14.409 --> 08:19.174
I'm interested in exactly in the areas that you're talking about.

08:19.814 --> 08:25.339
I have a very expensive article, which I never published, because I just didn't have the

08:25.960 --> 08:35.194
to send it anywhere, but I wrote a very extensive article on a chess collection a year or so ago.

08:36.115 --> 08:40.562
One of these days I will just update it and, you know, have it properly.

08:40.582 --> 08:44.728
But she says an earlier article about you said there were some polymaths and... Yes, there is.

08:44.748 --> 08:46.731
And this is from an article that you wrote.

08:46.891 --> 08:53.301
Well, no, I just mentioned it in my chess article that one was like Mr. White,

08:53.821 --> 08:56.984
and there is a severance family.

08:58.565 --> 09:03.610
There is a Huntington family for the colonialism of art.

09:04.731 --> 09:12.458
And these people had the money and they also had a very strong social conscience.

09:12.478 --> 09:22.427
They thought that they ought to give back something to this city to give them their wealth and success.

09:22.745 --> 09:32.435
There was a tradition of giving, and that's how this institution started.

09:32.515 --> 09:36.178
But in terms of book culture, it's more than a library, it seems.

09:36.198 --> 09:37.840
You've mentioned three million books.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.101
Oh, yes.

09:39.181 --> 09:40.923
They said that's monographs.

09:40.983 --> 09:46.989
They also have archives and all the visual materials and microphones.

09:47.550 --> 09:51.013
Like in my fine arts and music collection, I had

09:51.230 --> 09:53.394
over 20,000 sheep music.

09:53.474 --> 09:58.883
It is not included in this three million because they are not cataloged as monograph.

10:00.405 --> 10:07.317
It is a very large library with a research library, main library where you are right now.

10:08.679 --> 10:16.292
And then we have over 30 branches in our branch system which only have naturally circulating collections.

10:16.711 --> 10:19.675
But it is somewhat like the New York Public Library.

10:19.695 --> 10:22.839
You have the research libraries and you have the bench in there.

10:23.880 --> 10:46.228
And this one, the special collections, in addition to the white collection, has a collection of rare books, which books used to belong to various subject departments, but I came here in 69,

10:46.917 --> 11:07.359
And in 72, we established the rare book collection, which meant that we were filling in, and we are still filling in, rare books from a variety of subject departments, and all subjects.

11:07.379 --> 11:14.967
So they're culling the general collections, in other words, and finding items that more appropriately belong here.

11:15.318 --> 11:18.503
Like, you know, the surface was Indians.

11:18.523 --> 11:22.029
It does not belong to the open shell.

11:23.171 --> 11:25.134
And we found someone.

11:25.415 --> 11:33.689
Let me show you the red collection.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.712
I'm going to... Okay.

11:35.953 --> 11:37.275
Where is the new building going up?

11:37.295 --> 11:39.979
Oh, I will show it to you.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.981
It's next to us.

11:41.001 --> 11:41.562
It's...

11:43.162 --> 11:44.584
I'm checking some.

11:45.585 --> 11:47.608
You said you have a homepage on the internet?

11:47.688 --> 11:50.532
Yes, on the internet, and it's quite expensive.

11:50.552 --> 11:54.798
And we also have part of that catalogue on the internet.

11:54.818 --> 11:55.780
Let me get that.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.182
Let us go in there.

11:57.282 --> 12:03.250
What you said, it's only just part of the White Collection.

12:03.551 --> 12:08.798
We have storage areas that we are going in today.

12:09.082 --> 12:11.004
I love the ceiling.

12:11.285 --> 12:14.829
It is really after the Palazzo Modena in Rome.

12:15.991 --> 12:21.678
And, you know, Mr. White was on the board for about 18 years.

12:22.359 --> 12:29.248
And he was the president of the board, I don't know how long, 15 or 15 years.

12:31.571 --> 12:36.878
And he was really responsible for this building, this building.

12:37.583 --> 12:58.588
So, by that time, it was in 1935, he knew that he was giving... I mean, he had given 50,000 volumes by that time for a library, so this was built according to his specifications, and I think it is good.

12:58.608 --> 12:59.990
Look at this.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.832
Oh, I've never seen it again.

13:01.852 --> 13:04.435
And it's so beautifully made, right?

13:04.455 --> 13:06.898
Well, this used to be a lecture

13:07.334 --> 13:15.423
Then we ran out of space and it broke my heart that we had to put in this wall.

13:16.684 --> 13:23.912
And what you still see here and in the wall is the real materials in the white collection.

13:25.794 --> 13:28.857
Then this is all chess.

13:28.877 --> 13:31.941
Now, you know what's so interesting about the chess collection?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.943
You will love that.

13:33.963 --> 13:35.805
He did not only collect

13:36.123 --> 13:41.629
tournament books, rules, study books, history, and chess.

13:41.649 --> 13:47.376
He collected everything which made significant references to the game of chess.

13:47.396 --> 13:58.829
So I had all the small, terribly layered author collections by additions.

13:59.249 --> 14:01.231
Was he a good chess player?

14:01.312 --> 14:03.514
Mediocre, I understand.

14:03.899 --> 14:09.232
You see, they collect these by faith.

14:09.252 --> 14:12.480
And he has collected it.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.144
That's Rebellé?

14:14.245 --> 14:14.846
Yeah.

14:14.866 --> 14:17.553
Rebellé is a Rebellé collection.

14:17.573 --> 14:18.415
It's silver.

14:19.087 --> 14:37.373
that Michael Steele from Oxford about three years ago when he did his rabbi bibliography, had to come over here and spend two summers here, because I had traditions here which you could find anywhere else, including the bibliography as well, you know.

14:37.413 --> 14:41.719
The same for Castile Unis with the journal.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.942
It's a fantastic collection.

14:44.982 --> 14:46.164
Well, look at all the Rabelais.

14:46.204 --> 14:47.186
Why so much Rabelais?

14:47.406 --> 14:50.171
Because it's everywhere.

14:51.974 --> 15:00.909
And why thought every edition of everything that made Rabelais?

15:00.969 --> 15:05.857
It sounds like the RN's tobacco collection of the New York Public Library, only the chess equivalent.

15:05.937 --> 15:06.458
That's right.

15:07.079 --> 15:22.980
Now, of course, you know, I did say that this is the collection that was officially renamed and added to special collections, because by that time, in addition to the right collection, we had twelve other additional collections.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.288
So, this is what I'm going to show you.

15:29.308 --> 15:31.411
Like, it is the latest.

15:31.511 --> 15:33.313
It's a Bruce Rogers collection.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.535
It's Bruce.

15:34.555 --> 15:37.018
And this is all Bruce Rogers.

15:38.045 --> 15:39.868
These are lovely cases.

15:39.988 --> 15:42.711
These go back a little ways, don't they?

15:42.731 --> 15:45.215
Yes, that goes back to originally.

15:45.235 --> 15:57.832
And they are going to look back, and they came out from this side of the mall, and then that's right.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.136
Look at that beautiful sail.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.217
Wonderful.

16:01.197 --> 16:08.005
I was very happy if you were able to say that, and I insisted on seeing these cases.

16:08.026 --> 16:09.267
I knew that... They're wonderful.

16:09.287 --> 16:10.629
I was first to notice them.

16:10.649 --> 16:12.952
You know, money will be available.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.877
I knew it, not at that time, but I wanted to save them.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.800
I wasn't about to crash them.

16:19.820 --> 16:24.286
So, then the court is going to come off from here.

16:24.306 --> 16:24.566
Good.

16:24.706 --> 16:25.247
No.

16:25.700 --> 16:33.331
with the respiration and this thesis are going to go back where they belong.

16:33.351 --> 16:41.002
They sit there just perfect.

16:41.162 --> 16:45.468
And this unionization, they took away from the children and the children.

16:45.488 --> 16:48.392
Let me see, like this.

16:48.412 --> 16:54.441
This is an archive of superstitions and popular beliefs.

16:54.877 --> 17:02.912
And we have published that in the last... When I came here,

17:03.500 --> 17:09.729
I promised the director that I'm going to establish a publication project.

17:09.749 --> 17:27.315
So, so far we have published about five major publications, and this is a three-volume work edited by William Hand, who was the superstition expert in the United States.

17:27.335 --> 17:31.802
Our last publication project was about two years ago,

17:32.677 --> 17:37.152
It's about the... it is.

17:37.469 --> 18:02.112
the Francis Hall Journals, which was his manuscript in Paula, California, and which so far is the first complete diary of the first fifteen years of the term of the period of the German sports.

18:02.132 --> 18:04.995
And this man was an educated man.

18:04.975 --> 18:28.047
And he went out there right after, you know, the post-group, and established a trading company, but kept a very crooked journal of daily life for business contacts with the Japanese, and so on, and so forth.

18:28.533 --> 18:36.967
So, I found this journal, and then it's very exciting.

18:38.229 --> 18:55.637
And then we succeeded in interesting, made Fred Noodhopper from the University of California, who is the 19th century Japanese man in the United States, the editor in Princeton, Brazidon.

18:56.461 --> 19:04.854
And we published one of the first books on Black Names in America that's based on our archives.

19:04.874 --> 19:12.305
And I did the three-volume catalog of local booklines and folk songs.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.330
And my predecessor did it all.

19:15.833 --> 19:31.913
I'm very proud to show you that, not those, those like this, which goes to Romania, but this is our entire backlog.

19:31.933 --> 19:35.697
That's all that we have, the backlog, right?

19:35.737 --> 19:36.639
That's very good.

19:36.659 --> 19:37.900
I'm very proud of that.

19:40.223 --> 19:44.288
And right now, here you are in the...

19:44.993 --> 19:47.655
so-called rare book collection.

19:48.416 --> 20:00.347
Everything which is here is rare books, and I have another storage for rare books, and I have another storage for middle rare books.

20:00.367 --> 20:06.273
But these are books which were collected from subject departments.

20:07.194 --> 20:10.657
And you decided that they were rare?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.739
Well, I went to find them.

20:13.462 --> 20:19.830
I don't know when, but, you know, it's still an ongoing project.

20:20.231 --> 20:21.732
In my experience... Princess, look at this book.

20:21.752 --> 20:24.156
This came from the General Collections.

20:24.176 --> 20:24.796
What is it?

20:24.876 --> 20:26.659
Can you just tell me what it is?

20:26.679 --> 20:29.182
Well, this is the history of Russian atlas.

20:29.282 --> 20:30.103
And it's huge.

20:30.123 --> 20:30.564
Look at that.

20:30.584 --> 20:37.072
Look at that wonderful binding gold of the... It's from the reference collection, number two.

20:37.232 --> 20:40.256
Yeah, Hobart Kiramnesis.

20:40.276 --> 20:41.157
Look at that.

20:41.947 --> 20:44.029
Look at, oh my God, look at that.

20:45.371 --> 20:48.874
And somebody, God forbid, could go in and steal these maps out of there.

20:49.074 --> 20:50.836
They are not in my department.

20:50.856 --> 20:55.081
I'm saying, when they were out in reference, they were vulnerable, I guess is the word I'm saying.

20:55.101 --> 21:03.529
I can tell you, some of them, like, I neglected to pull in a dart hunter book.

21:03.549 --> 21:07.714
And by the time I got to pulling it in, it was gone.

21:08.394 --> 21:09.996
It was circulating.

21:10.263 --> 21:20.326
One of the dealers came in and he said, oh, I have a copy you can buy for $800.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.050
I said, you know.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.235
Roger, you don't have to go through the whole thing.

21:24.275 --> 21:29.166
That came from, we're looking at a beautiful book.

21:29.450 --> 21:33.274
Not quite an elephant folio, but it's... All right.

21:33.795 --> 21:36.418
How about the North American Indians, sir?

21:36.438 --> 21:36.718
Oh, my God.

21:37.059 --> 21:40.182
Edward Curtis, C-Y-T-I-S, the North American Indian.

21:40.202 --> 21:45.248
And, you know, they think about some of these plates at $20,000.

21:45.268 --> 21:46.469
How many volumes?

21:46.489 --> 21:47.170
All of these.

21:47.190 --> 21:52.736
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

21:52.756 --> 21:53.037
Yes.

21:53.778 --> 21:54.859
This is 20 volumes?

21:55.760 --> 21:55.840
Yes.

21:55.860 --> 21:56.841
And where were these?

21:57.192 --> 21:59.395
These are all general collections.

22:00.076 --> 22:02.059
Anybody could come in and take them out.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.081
Are all the plates preserved?

22:04.102 --> 22:04.883
Before 1972.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.286
That's fairly recent.

22:07.406 --> 22:08.708
But all the plates are still there?

22:09.148 --> 22:10.771
The Curtis one, yes.

22:10.791 --> 22:14.516
Here is the Nuremberg Chronicle.

22:14.676 --> 22:16.358
Don't tell me that was out there, too.

22:16.378 --> 22:23.648
Well, anything that you see here, I could show you, except I put it in.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.013
Is that an original binding in the Chronicle?

22:27.280 --> 22:30.504
The chronicle didn't have an original binding.

22:31.164 --> 22:37.572
I have seen about twelve original chronicles.

22:37.592 --> 22:39.734
They all were bound differently.

22:40.415 --> 22:42.477
The various owners had bound them.

22:42.497 --> 22:42.818
That's right.

22:42.838 --> 22:44.600
It was the same thing with the Copernicus.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.945
They printed them, and then the owner would bind it to his taste.

22:48.965 --> 22:49.966
Now, look at that.

22:51.387 --> 22:51.748
Dickens.

22:51.768 --> 22:56.393
This chipling, with the chipling leather in here.

22:56.778 --> 23:05.330
So this room basically houses material that you have collected from your own general collections.

23:05.931 --> 23:06.552
Correct, that's right.

23:06.572 --> 23:09.396
How many volumes would you think are in here?

23:09.416 --> 23:10.077
20,000 volumes.

23:10.097 --> 23:10.698
20,000?

23:10.878 --> 23:12.180
Over the last 25 years?

23:13.001 --> 23:15.485
Yes, and that's in 72.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.488
You've been here since 72?

23:17.648 --> 23:18.870
No, I've been here since 69.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.011
And where did you come from?

23:20.372 --> 23:25.519
From the Cleveland Museum, from the Budapest Museum.

23:25.769 --> 23:30.355
My original training is in museology.

23:30.596 --> 23:30.736
Uh-huh.

23:31.597 --> 23:34.101
And it's the news and curricular training.

23:34.862 --> 23:39.729
And I was lucky because I couldn't think up my mind what I wanted to become.

23:40.429 --> 23:43.794
So I wanted to get a triple masters.

23:43.814 --> 23:44.295
And that's it here.

23:44.455 --> 23:45.276
And where was that?

23:45.296 --> 23:45.957
Where did you get?

23:45.977 --> 23:46.798
Because, uh— Are you Hungarian?

23:47.559 --> 23:47.680
Yeah.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.541
One is in—I'm German.

23:48.561 --> 23:48.821
I'm English.

23:48.841 --> 23:54.409
One is the—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in—in

23:54.777 --> 24:06.048
and the other is art history, and the third one is an archaeology.

24:06.368 --> 24:15.256
Now, this I pulled in, and I am happy to tell you, but it has 18 documents in it.

24:15.276 --> 24:15.517
Come on.

24:15.897 --> 24:17.098
Yeah.

24:17.118 --> 24:23.184
Some different letters, and... Authentic, holographic documents?

24:23.204 --> 24:24.345
Yeah.

24:25.068 --> 24:26.510
Can I see the cover of this?

24:27.772 --> 24:28.013
No.

24:28.513 --> 24:30.917
So this is something you bound here, probably, at some point.

24:30.937 --> 24:31.758
Oh, it hasn't.

24:31.778 --> 24:32.540
No.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.982
No.

24:34.002 --> 24:35.124
Tell me a little bit.

24:35.144 --> 24:36.185
Tell me a little bit about this.

24:36.205 --> 24:38.990
That's a fascinating book.

24:40.172 --> 24:42.896
The title is David Copperfield, Volume 2.

24:42.916 --> 24:43.497
Sure.

24:43.897 --> 24:43.998
Okay.

24:44.719 --> 24:47.022
Now... Well, this is a set, obviously.

24:47.062 --> 24:50.508
Yes, this is a set.

24:50.728 --> 24:52.611
So these aren't first editions, per se.

24:52.895 --> 24:56.278
No, but this is the limited edition.

24:56.799 --> 25:00.842
But it is a laid-in sub with 18 documents.

25:02.324 --> 25:04.786
And so they can flatter.

25:04.806 --> 25:05.947
Can I just see what this says here?

25:06.448 --> 25:08.550
This is the gift of William E. Baldwin.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.493
So, this was a gift in 1964.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.535
And they were out downstairs.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.657
This is in the literature department.

25:16.677 --> 25:17.258
Yes, yes.

25:18.799 --> 25:20.021
This is the national edition.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.602
It's called the National Edition.

25:22.223 --> 25:29.671
There's only 750 copies for England and America, the type of which has been distributed as each wagon was printed.

25:29.771 --> 25:31.633
So Chapman and Hall teaching.

25:34.056 --> 25:34.917
And what year was this?

25:35.277 --> 25:41.984
I think that this was 1910 or something.

25:42.104 --> 25:43.025
It's wonderful.

25:43.646 --> 25:45.148
It's beautiful.

25:45.748 --> 25:50.053
And it was owned by the son of Richard.

25:50.860 --> 25:55.804
the one who is living in America at one point.

25:57.085 --> 26:03.311
But it has a very, very curious, interesting background.

26:03.911 --> 26:08.195
If you want to, I have given a clock on it, I can send a copy.

26:08.435 --> 26:09.956
That would be great.

26:10.056 --> 26:13.940
I ran out of cards, and so I'm going to have to write down my name for you.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.022
If you give me your card, I'll let you know.

26:16.142 --> 26:20.125
It is really very interesting.

26:20.290 --> 26:22.572
Can I see one of the letters?

26:23.093 --> 26:26.677
I'm just thinking, which volume has it been?

26:26.897 --> 26:28.839
So it's one letter or a letter?

26:28.859 --> 26:49.420
No, two Dickens letters, and the rest of them from the Dickensian circle, like his and his doctor, and it's just, I was in London, I started to tell you that, and I spent three days with Kathleen Philipson,

26:49.687 --> 26:53.211
who is publishing the Deacon's Correspondents.

26:53.231 --> 26:57.976
So these materials will be published in the Deacon's Correspondents.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.037
Are they good letters?

26:59.798 --> 27:02.681
I mean, are they?

27:02.841 --> 27:16.496
One of them he wrote on board ships when he was coming over to the seamstress, you know?

27:16.596 --> 27:16.656
No.

27:17.108 --> 27:24.035
But some of the letters, you know, from this circle are not that important.

27:24.055 --> 27:28.619
But those two Dickens letters are important, especially the one which he wrote.

27:28.639 --> 27:31.041
Well, I don't think so, I'm sure.

27:31.101 --> 27:35.526
And he's saying that he's coming over here, you know.

27:35.546 --> 27:39.329
So, at that time, we don't use that anymore.

27:39.429 --> 27:41.031
We just use their books.

27:41.051 --> 27:45.495
But you see, this is the way how this word published.

27:45.678 --> 27:50.824
But it happened here.

27:50.844 --> 27:54.348
And the shelf comes point, point.

27:55.689 --> 28:04.059
So I do not believe in doing anything.

28:04.079 --> 28:07.703
So I kept the original boxes.

28:08.408 --> 28:11.373
But I have ordered these boxes.

28:11.593 --> 28:13.897
This is how they were issued, so you certainly want to keep them.

28:13.917 --> 28:17.242
I'm not about to discard them.

28:18.063 --> 28:22.611
You know, because I want to see them.

28:22.671 --> 28:24.093
They are wonderful.

28:24.574 --> 28:30.684
So what you've got is you've alternated the box that was issued with it with your own clamshell box for each volume.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.107
And how many, I think you said 26 volumes?

28:33.127 --> 28:34.129
Yeah, something like that.

28:34.936 --> 28:36.197
I've never seen this offer.

28:36.237 --> 28:39.660
This must be a very—I've never seen these available.

28:39.880 --> 28:45.385
You wouldn't believe how excited I was, and how lucky I was.

28:45.485 --> 28:46.446
But you just found this?

28:47.287 --> 28:50.410
I found this, but I didn't think it was big or big kind of all that.

28:50.430 --> 28:51.871
Were you just going through the collection?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.733
I am going through the collection.

28:53.753 --> 28:55.374
So you continue to go through the collection?

28:55.394 --> 28:57.776
You see, this is not catalogued, as with these letters.

28:58.957 --> 29:02.020
Didn't mean that the letters are in it.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.082
I pulled in the addition.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.968
And I put it in because of one reason, because of the binding.

29:10.449 --> 29:15.576
This is done by a very famous English binder.

29:15.836 --> 29:21.765
And I was just looking for you, for—not all of them are signed.

29:21.785 --> 29:26.491
The official library at the University— So you were just kind of going through, and— I am going to.

29:26.612 --> 29:27.012
I'm still doing.

29:27.032 --> 29:32.500
So this is a continuing process, but— But so where in the library were these?

29:32.783 --> 29:35.988
Just there?

29:36.309 --> 29:39.634
I could come in if I had a library card and take that book out?

29:39.695 --> 29:41.417
No, but you could borrow that.

29:41.758 --> 29:43.521
I mean, you could use it in the library.

29:43.541 --> 29:44.883
So it was not circulating.

29:44.903 --> 29:46.706
It was not a circulating book.

29:46.726 --> 29:47.227
That's good.

29:47.307 --> 29:51.554
It was a reference book, but you could sit down and use it.

29:51.574 --> 29:56.783
And they were so fortunate, nobody stole the letters.

29:56.915 --> 29:57.936
I couldn't be late.

29:57.976 --> 29:59.879
Well, nobody probably—yeah, but it's late.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.221
I'm surprised somebody didn't know.

30:01.381 --> 30:02.523
I mean, you're very lucky.

30:02.783 --> 30:04.886
And you know what else I was lucky for?

30:05.347 --> 30:11.836
In about two days, I found an auction sales record of this set.

30:11.856 --> 30:12.056
Uh-huh.

30:12.998 --> 30:23.192
And it was sold in New York, and by the Adams, book dealers.

30:24.235 --> 30:26.117
And I think this is the one.

30:26.217 --> 30:26.618
Yeah.

30:26.638 --> 30:27.779
Now, here is one document.

30:27.799 --> 30:28.500
Look at that.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.363
You see?

30:30.463 --> 30:32.585
I've identified all of them.

30:32.866 --> 30:35.129
That's an envelope with a stamp on it.

30:35.149 --> 30:35.369
Yeah.

30:35.970 --> 30:37.011
That's not a facsimile.

30:37.031 --> 30:37.872
That's the original.

30:37.892 --> 30:38.593
No, no, no.

30:38.613 --> 30:39.194
These are all original.

30:40.776 --> 30:42.458
And you know what is so interesting?

30:42.498 --> 30:43.379
There's another one.

30:43.399 --> 30:43.840
Here they are.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.841
They can clutter.

30:44.861 --> 30:46.303
That's definitely different.

30:46.703 --> 30:47.124
There you are.

30:47.144 --> 30:50.047
Here is from Hyde Park Place London.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.109
That's the second letter.

30:51.810 --> 30:52.150
It's interesting.

30:53.108 --> 31:10.511
and he wrote it to Buckstone, and Tillotson was very happy about that, because it sets his address in that time, you know.

31:11.612 --> 31:14.175
Which was Gadshill Place?

31:14.536 --> 31:16.198
Gadshill Place was his.

31:16.479 --> 31:19.943
Okay, but this is 1870, so... Yeah, 1870, yes.

31:20.210 --> 31:23.333
But he was traveling, you see, at this year.

31:24.174 --> 31:33.122
And this, it was written in athron, and he's saying that he will be at Gertrude Place until the first of June.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.683
So the dates of that place is him?

31:35.424 --> 31:36.085
Yes.

31:36.105 --> 31:38.126
Of course, he's trying to determine where he is.

31:38.186 --> 31:40.749
It's quite important, you know.

31:40.769 --> 31:42.250
I almost slept.

31:42.751 --> 31:43.531
This is Crookshank.

31:43.551 --> 31:44.432
You almost what?

31:44.452 --> 31:45.373
I almost slept.

31:45.393 --> 31:47.055
And this is a letter from Crookshank.

31:47.075 --> 31:47.535
Look at that.

31:48.896 --> 31:49.677
My dear friend.

31:51.293 --> 31:58.039
By the light of yesterday evening, son, I discovered that you and your wife had got a daughter.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.241
Oh, that's to a friend.

31:59.301 --> 32:01.923
Congratulations for 1856.

32:02.984 --> 32:03.705
That's Cripshank.

32:03.865 --> 32:04.806
That's pretty good.

32:05.527 --> 32:07.529
Oh, God, this is wonderful stuff.

32:07.549 --> 32:08.750
So what was the auction record?

32:08.770 --> 32:09.671
How much did it sell for?

32:09.991 --> 32:13.254
Well, in fact, it didn't interest me so much.

32:13.554 --> 32:19.360
What interested me was this, uh,

32:19.576 --> 32:23.861
Because I'll track down the newspaper advertisement.

32:24.642 --> 32:44.224
It said that this set was sold by the second son of Lord Connolly, who lives in New York and who is selling vegetables.

32:44.244 --> 32:46.426
This is awfully interesting.

32:46.586 --> 32:47.187
You know why?

32:47.926 --> 32:52.511
Because he never had a second son.

32:52.531 --> 32:52.651
Right.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.235
He did not have a legitimate second son.

32:56.255 --> 32:58.578
Oh, Dickens, though, I was saying.

32:58.598 --> 32:58.978
You, the Somerhill.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.139
Somerhill, I'm sorry.

33:01.000 --> 33:01.961
Fine and dandy.

33:02.122 --> 33:07.027
Who was this man who sold those things and claims to be?

33:07.047 --> 33:13.614
Now, it is perfectly possible that, and... You're not talking about this set, now you're talking about another set.

33:13.634 --> 33:14.896
Exactly this set.

33:14.956 --> 33:16.077
This very set.

33:16.225 --> 33:19.189
Oh, so you found the record for it?

33:19.289 --> 33:19.990
Yes.

33:20.051 --> 33:21.032
Two records.

33:21.052 --> 33:25.779
And the newspaper article on it, you know.

33:25.799 --> 33:36.775
It also said that the man inherited only this set from his father, and a picture, a painting by somebody, I forgot.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.218
But who was this man?

33:42.543 --> 33:46.148
He was not a legitimate son.

33:46.583 --> 33:52.571
Now, of course, you know, I've, you know, gotten in touch with the English family.

33:52.591 --> 34:05.969
They are not answering, and I have not had a chance to, um, how can I say, uh, to make an answer.

34:06.409 --> 34:06.650
Mm-hmm.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.172
I mean, I can.

34:08.973 --> 34:15.882
Um, I have, uh, I know people in England who are in the same circles, and I've had, you know,

34:16.317 --> 34:20.062
Eventually, I will get to that guy, you know.

34:20.082 --> 34:28.052
But he's just a, I understand that he's just a youngster, just inherited the title a year before this set came up.

34:29.114 --> 34:33.480
And probably he was just a playboy.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.881
I was unfortunate.

34:34.901 --> 34:42.992
I should have found this set a year before he came, because his father, I understand, was very... A little more agreeable, yeah.

34:43.012 --> 34:43.793
...oriented.

34:44.093 --> 34:46.275
But I will run this now.

34:46.596 --> 34:51.140
I just hope it's not a big town called Butler.

34:51.801 --> 34:54.864
But, you know.

34:55.184 --> 34:59.569
Anyhow, I am not sure you have never seen this.

35:00.249 --> 35:02.712
It is the heaviest book in the writing.

35:02.732 --> 35:04.754
Investigations and studies in jade.

35:05.315 --> 35:05.915
Two writings.

35:06.015 --> 35:06.336
Huge.

35:06.436 --> 35:07.897
Bigger than elephant fairy is.

35:07.917 --> 35:09.799
85 pounds.

35:10.260 --> 35:10.620
You know why?

35:11.361 --> 35:13.543
It has specimens of jade in it.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.254
It is the heaviest thing you have ever written.

35:17.274 --> 35:18.335
Well, we'll leave it where it is.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.418
We'll leave it right there where it is.

35:20.439 --> 35:23.122
But that also is in reference, right?

35:23.142 --> 35:25.165
Oh, and then here you have Pyrenees.

35:25.185 --> 35:27.829
Beautiful books.

35:27.949 --> 35:28.891
Really, wonderful.

35:28.931 --> 35:29.712
Congratulations.

35:29.732 --> 35:32.696
And when did you establish this unit?

35:32.716 --> 35:35.060
I am looking and it can start in the tomb.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.443
So you've decided, I'm going to make a, this is a project.

35:38.445 --> 35:40.207
So we have treasure right here in the building.

35:40.708 --> 35:41.930
Yeah, right.

35:42.110 --> 35:44.273
It used to be called treasure,

35:44.962 --> 35:47.786
It comes, you know, from the German Kunstkammer.

35:48.467 --> 35:56.399
But the Americans in Cleveland, they really thought they were hiding some gold behind the doors, you know.

35:57.480 --> 36:02.227
So they were recognized for their value, but they were just not as secure as they should be.

36:02.648 --> 36:05.913
Well, they were just reference books, but not all of them.

36:05.933 --> 36:06.994
So why were they in a room?

36:07.034 --> 36:08.637
Why do they call the room the treasure room?

36:09.077 --> 36:12.542
Because that was the original John G. Wright treasure room.

36:12.562 --> 36:12.943
I see.

36:14.729 --> 36:15.650
Mr. White.

36:16.491 --> 36:17.492
But it was the reference room.

36:18.253 --> 36:18.873
Well, I knew.

36:19.414 --> 36:25.360
You see, the door where we came through used to have a lettering over its treasure room.

36:25.541 --> 36:25.961
I see.

36:25.981 --> 36:26.281
Okay?

36:27.022 --> 36:33.169
And this is where they originally had the John G. White rare books.

36:33.189 --> 36:34.230
I see.

36:34.250 --> 36:37.153
These are not John G. White rare books.

36:38.054 --> 36:41.057
They did not come from John G. White himself.

36:41.425 --> 36:44.810
or were purchased by his funds, you see.

36:45.371 --> 36:46.713
We keep that separate.

36:46.753 --> 36:51.379
We have to, legal-wise, because we have the trust fund.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.441
Of course, yeah.

36:52.461 --> 36:58.029
So these were purchased with Cleveland Public Library funds.

36:58.049 --> 36:58.309
I see.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.473
And these are what again?

37:00.493 --> 37:01.154
These are huge.

37:01.354 --> 37:04.098
I don't know what this big money is all about.

37:04.118 --> 37:06.561
Want me to help you?

37:06.581 --> 37:07.703
It's time I shoot you.

37:09.488 --> 37:13.732
Oh, that's the Piranesi also.

37:13.953 --> 37:16.435
And what are the Piranesi?

37:16.455 --> 37:22.461
The Piranesi are one of the most wonderful people use of the people label.

37:22.621 --> 37:23.803
T-I-R-A-N-E-S-I.

37:24.523 --> 37:24.624
Yeah.

37:24.644 --> 37:25.124
Piranesi.

37:25.645 --> 37:29.308
Vases, candlesticks, and tripads.

37:29.328 --> 37:29.569
Triptics.

37:29.589 --> 37:31.811
Triptics, T-R-E-P-I-C.

37:31.871 --> 37:32.952
Triptics, you know, there's three.

37:32.972 --> 37:33.773
Triptics is the three, yeah.

37:34.634 --> 37:36.296
It's spelled differently.

37:36.316 --> 37:36.516
Yeah.

37:37.076 --> 37:37.757
And this one,

37:38.311 --> 37:40.174
and also build that out with them.

37:42.898 --> 37:44.680
And we don't need the prints.

37:46.322 --> 37:58.019
If you look up auction records, we realize very kind of, individually, people, friends.

38:00.603 --> 38:06.812
Did Bob say when he was going to come to get me, by the way?

38:06.872 --> 38:07.693
Oh, B-L-E-A-U.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.891
Yeah.

38:08.991 --> 38:10.213
Oh, that's famous.

38:10.233 --> 38:11.935
Yeah, that's famous.

38:13.357 --> 38:17.021
Those are very famous.

38:17.121 --> 38:19.704
I think that that book is all English.

38:19.725 --> 38:22.688
Tableau is 2, 4, 6, 8, 12.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.070
Huge books, whites.

38:24.090 --> 38:25.972
Oh, yeah.

38:25.992 --> 38:29.076
Well, you know, they're not as big as the Audubon.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.038
Do you have an Audubon set here?

38:31.058 --> 38:31.319
No.

38:31.539 --> 38:34.002
I have the money for that.

38:34.437 --> 38:45.910
Now, this is where the cathedral, in fact, is in this open shelf, but right now it's up in New England and it's being restored.

38:46.171 --> 38:46.471
Where?

38:46.911 --> 38:47.352
New England?

38:47.552 --> 38:49.595
New England Conservation Center.

38:49.635 --> 38:49.935
Oh, I see.

38:49.955 --> 38:52.278
Yeah, because I'm based in Boston.

38:52.478 --> 38:59.466
Now, this here, our political campus, this is about the 16th century,

39:00.678 --> 39:02.720
And they're just wonderful.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.903
They come from, they keep them by country.

39:06.063 --> 39:07.024
Sixteenth century.

39:07.144 --> 39:07.684
Yeah.

39:07.704 --> 39:08.645
Fifteen hundred.

39:08.865 --> 39:11.268
That's the real idea, I believe.

39:11.288 --> 39:13.089
And... And where did these come from?

39:13.409 --> 39:16.252
They come from the history department.

39:16.272 --> 39:17.133
And where did they get them?

39:17.153 --> 39:18.754
There must have been gifts.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.456
Originally, they bought them.

39:20.476 --> 39:23.158
We don't know the problems of everything.

39:23.178 --> 39:25.040
But, I mean, how did they get to the Cleveland Library?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.361
Somebody bought them.

39:26.922 --> 39:30.685
We have some very, very well-educated librarians here.

39:31.002 --> 39:37.130
especially in 1910, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 50th, you know.

39:37.871 --> 39:54.252
And the Cleveland Public Library, up to the middle of the 19th, up to 1977, I believe, hired subject specialists for its subject department.

39:55.113 --> 40:00.840
Otherwise, a generalist librarian would not be hired

40:01.276 --> 40:06.841
to work in science and technology or in literature, you know.

40:07.842 --> 40:13.708
And the former head of foreign literature just retired.

40:15.170 --> 40:19.033
My goodness, that woman spoke six languages fluently, you know.

40:20.695 --> 40:27.942
Now, after 1977, the idea of generalists coming in was

40:28.276 --> 40:36.569
And it's very difficult for a person like me, because I said, what do I do with an American lit major?

40:36.749 --> 40:36.950
Sure.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.953
I don't need that, you know.

40:39.894 --> 40:42.278
Did Bob say, by the way, what time he's picking me up?

40:42.478 --> 40:44.041
Oh, he's going to come in here.

40:44.221 --> 40:45.243
Oh, is he?

40:45.363 --> 40:47.025
Oh, you do?

40:47.446 --> 40:48.007
Okay.

40:48.027 --> 40:51.252
You know, I'm giving a talk tonight at the Rofond Club.

40:52.434 --> 40:55.178
Do you know what that is, that description, is it?

40:56.002 --> 40:58.425
on the Napoleonic Survey of Egypt.

40:58.445 --> 40:59.447
Oh, is that what that is?

40:59.467 --> 41:03.432
So those are probably the original lithographs in there.

41:03.452 --> 41:03.612
Oh, yes.

41:03.632 --> 41:08.198
One, two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten.

41:08.278 --> 41:09.460
What are they called again now?

41:10.321 --> 41:13.766
Description of Egypt in French.

41:13.786 --> 41:17.811
And this is an Ethiopic manuscript.

41:18.231 --> 41:19.573
These are elephant folios.

41:19.733 --> 41:22.397
They're called white elephant folios.

41:23.255 --> 41:25.378
And these look like they've been used pretty good.

41:25.398 --> 41:26.780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:26.800 --> 41:33.129
And they have been, you know, in the general sex, pretty much abused.

41:33.951 --> 41:45.147
This is why I was, you know, willing to undertake this extra job because I wanted to save this material.

41:45.167 --> 41:48.492
And you do not prepare before that.

41:48.952 --> 41:51.456
And you do not look...

41:51.740 --> 41:53.942
You don't keep them dusty either.

41:55.004 --> 41:56.285
There's no dust in my collection.

41:56.365 --> 41:57.747
So what persuaded you to do that?

41:57.767 --> 41:59.208
There's no dust in your collection.

41:59.248 --> 41:59.549
Nope.

41:59.689 --> 42:00.890
I love that quote.

42:00.930 --> 42:02.312
Nope.

42:02.832 --> 42:06.156
Neither am I very popular with some of my pages, you know.

42:06.176 --> 42:08.178
Well, you do what you have to do, though.

42:08.619 --> 42:12.563
I said a young man, grab that dust cloth and get busy.

42:12.964 --> 42:16.207
There's no dust in my—I love that.

42:16.227 --> 42:17.028
I hate it.

42:17.048 --> 42:18.490
I mean, I hate when you have—

42:18.740 --> 42:22.885
an extensive book under a cover of dust.

42:22.905 --> 42:25.809
Dust is very, very damaging to paper.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.654
So you basically kind of have free reign.

42:29.674 --> 42:34.981
You decide, you go out and say, this book comes up, so you have no problems with the other departments.

42:35.001 --> 42:35.742
Oh, no.

42:37.184 --> 42:41.430
Well, no, because you don't do that.

42:41.450 --> 42:46.857
When we started out, when I started out, I was talking to all the department heads

42:47.714 --> 42:52.178
I explained what they are trying to do.

42:53.099 --> 43:02.467
I get them on my side, and I consider it a cooperative effort.

43:02.487 --> 43:09.273
And if they have any suggestion, I'm very grateful to review it.

43:09.293 --> 43:14.677
And if I find something, I don't order them, I ask.

43:15.238 --> 43:17.620
This is not a position where you

43:18.207 --> 43:19.929
are a dictator.

43:19.949 --> 43:32.400
You work with your colleagues, and you have to make it sure that they understand what is the purpose of it, and that it isn't that somebody is raising their collection.

43:32.860 --> 43:36.163
I have never had one opposition.

43:36.183 --> 43:37.204
Never.

43:38.105 --> 43:43.970
And I usually send it to them, the request, with a dealer's quote.

43:43.990 --> 43:47.353
I would say that, now you have this book, it costs too much,

43:47.992 --> 43:53.860
in addition of being rare, would you consider its friends?

43:53.880 --> 43:57.445
The next thing I see the book is up here.

43:57.465 --> 44:00.089
No, no, never in here.

44:00.109 --> 44:00.350
Great.

44:00.970 --> 44:09.783
And you know, since I started this preservation project in this library, they love to come in here once in a while.

44:10.584 --> 44:13.468
And this is all, of course, with greatly restricted access.

44:13.989 --> 44:14.970
Nobody comes in.

44:15.010 --> 44:16.092
Nobody comes in here.

44:16.426 --> 44:23.278
You want to see something, you fill out a request slip and staff brings it out to you and you sit at the table with another two pencil.

44:23.338 --> 44:29.548
Not even my colleagues come in here and escort them.

44:29.568 --> 44:37.902
Not even in another department has been doing research here alone, no.

44:37.922 --> 44:40.206
I'm not taking that responsibility.

44:41.401 --> 44:45.087
I trust them, but it's in progress.

44:45.107 --> 44:46.429
You're doing what has to be done.

44:46.489 --> 44:47.010
That's all.

44:47.030 --> 44:47.531
In progress.

44:47.832 --> 44:50.236
You have to respect.

44:50.476 --> 44:54.943
These are very precious things that have been entrusted to your care, and that's what you're doing.

44:57.307 --> 45:02.456
This is a collection of singing to Admiral Gould.

45:02.476 --> 45:02.616
Uh-huh.

45:02.866 --> 45:11.728
which doesn't contain too many original material and I'm very seriously considering

45:12.805 --> 45:19.415
to the Ohio University in Columbus because they have an admiral.

45:20.096 --> 45:25.163
I'm a great believer of building on your strengths.

45:25.183 --> 45:28.408
And I think that this is really just the secondary.

45:28.629 --> 45:36.661
So what it is, it's basically some... It's a new kid, yeah, first edition, and a woman's craft book.

45:37.121 --> 45:40.026
Yeah, that's not primary material.

45:40.046 --> 45:41.648
It's not a primary material.

45:42.708 --> 45:46.772
A few.

45:46.792 --> 45:51.917
The people of Cleveland have a wonderful facility here, don't they?

45:52.357 --> 45:56.702
Look, this is the Darth Hunter book.

45:57.382 --> 46:01.086
I saw one of these in Hugo Alper's house yesterday.

46:01.366 --> 46:08.293
Well, by now I think I have almost all of this book of the Darth Hunter one.

46:08.695 --> 46:15.864
And I already ordered the new one that the human down in Southam there is going to publish next year.

46:15.884 --> 46:17.426
Is this a book about him?

46:17.446 --> 46:17.626
Yeah.

46:17.987 --> 46:20.650
Yeah, but it also will have specimens.

46:22.172 --> 46:22.973
Who's publishing it?

46:22.993 --> 46:23.453
Do you know what?

46:23.553 --> 46:24.895
Oh, she's published.

46:24.915 --> 46:25.456
Not uphand.

46:25.476 --> 46:26.437
I don't think uphand.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.581
You know, but this is like him.

46:30.602 --> 46:38.432
And this is, I have to check it, make it sure that the Catalani... Now, what is this?

46:39.104 --> 46:42.528
This is Doron's work.

46:42.548 --> 46:45.451
This is the way we are handling them.

46:46.572 --> 46:47.613
Very secure.

46:49.415 --> 46:50.916
And this is 1603.

46:50.937 --> 46:52.418
1603.

46:53.379 --> 46:54.721
By whom again?

46:54.841 --> 46:55.662
By Doron.

46:55.842 --> 46:57.163
D-O-R-O-N.

46:57.283 --> 46:59.526
And is this his handwriting here?

46:59.546 --> 47:00.907
This is Basilikum.

47:01.428 --> 47:04.371
No, this is not his handwriting.

47:04.391 --> 47:07.474
This is somebody with the last name of Scott.

47:07.741 --> 47:08.382
I see.

47:08.442 --> 47:09.423
An early owner.

47:10.204 --> 47:11.726
An early owner, I think.

47:12.747 --> 47:19.396
And this came out of the first question.

47:21.658 --> 47:22.419
That's amazing.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.561
What was the title of this?

47:24.061 --> 47:25.003
A basilicum.

47:25.563 --> 47:26.725
A basilicum.

47:26.745 --> 47:27.245
A basilicum.

47:27.546 --> 47:28.547
That's a Greek word.

47:28.847 --> 47:32.011
How do we spell it with the English?

47:32.092 --> 47:33.493
Oops, I'm sorry.

47:33.954 --> 47:37.258
It's B-A-S-I

47:38.048 --> 47:40.390
L-I-K-O-N.

47:40.490 --> 47:42.332
By James Doron.

47:43.453 --> 47:44.454
D-O-R-O-N.

47:44.994 --> 47:49.238
I'll show it in a minute.

47:50.580 --> 47:54.123
Just so when I transcribe this tape, it won't be indifferent.

47:54.223 --> 47:56.885
Isn't that exciting?

47:56.946 --> 47:59.047
We have this one statement here.

47:59.548 --> 48:07.195
The problem is that I have to go through each and every one of them personally.

48:08.103 --> 48:13.388
I'm just one person, you know, not a million volumes.

48:13.408 --> 48:20.054
But you said that when you began you had three different graduate interests, so you really didn't know it would be books.

48:21.435 --> 48:25.219
You didn't know that your future, your career, your profession would be with books.

48:25.239 --> 48:27.181
No, I was supposed to be a Muslim curator.

48:27.201 --> 48:28.762
But now how do you feel being with books?

48:29.102 --> 48:30.524
I love books.

48:30.664 --> 48:31.825
I grew up with books.

48:32.045 --> 48:35.308
Did they have the same kind of artifact, the same...

48:36.031 --> 48:39.675
effect on you as an artifact, so that a museum piece might?

48:40.576 --> 48:47.104
Well, I can't say that I can get as excited about them as I would about the Picasso.

48:47.284 --> 48:49.567
Well, that's a unique piece, of course.

48:49.587 --> 48:51.369
You know.

48:51.469 --> 49:05.245
Or any artwork was great important, but I love books, I grew up with books, and I was very fortunate because in my training,

49:05.782 --> 49:09.608
I had over 130 hours in epigraphy alone.

49:10.549 --> 49:11.771
So... What was that study?

49:11.871 --> 49:12.572
Epigraphy.

49:12.592 --> 49:13.213
Epigraphy.

49:13.253 --> 49:17.579
You said, you know, various scripts, handwriting.

49:18.681 --> 49:20.964
Here is your Doron.

49:21.024 --> 49:22.286
D-O-R-O.

49:22.346 --> 49:24.990
James Doron I, I suppose.

49:25.010 --> 49:25.491
No, no, no, no.

49:25.511 --> 49:28.735
That's I. You know, let me show I. Just call it Basilikum.

49:28.755 --> 49:28.996
Okay.

49:29.016 --> 49:30.658
We're talking about his name, Mrs. Vettel.

49:30.925 --> 49:33.107
That's okay, that's fine.

49:33.848 --> 49:34.488
I see.

49:34.669 --> 49:35.609
That's about changing.

49:36.030 --> 49:38.292
You know, I think Bob was probably... Let's go off.

49:39.513 --> 49:42.516
I have to go home and put a tuxedo on for tonight.

49:42.556 --> 49:47.961
I'm sorry, you say you buy like... You buy expensive.

49:47.981 --> 49:48.582
At auction?

49:48.602 --> 49:49.503
Through dealers?

49:50.364 --> 49:59.312
From Ethiopia to South Asia to Mali, you name it.

50:00.018 --> 50:04.965
All our European countries, Marquess, London, Paris.

50:05.546 --> 50:06.788
I love these old carts.

50:06.808 --> 50:07.870
They've lasted forever.

50:08.030 --> 50:11.435
But these are only new acquisitions in the last few months.

50:11.455 --> 50:12.677
These are new acquisitions?

50:12.717 --> 50:16.323
We're looking at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

50:16.643 --> 50:18.225
There are 10 carts here.

50:19.287 --> 50:20.829
So who's deciding what to buy?

50:20.889 --> 50:23.033
I guess you or Lange?

50:23.393 --> 50:26.278
I'm going to the bookseller.

50:26.498 --> 50:29.282
For this department and for fine arts.

50:29.988 --> 50:31.710
and for music history.

50:32.330 --> 50:35.133
The only thing I do... So you wear three hats, so to speak.

50:35.153 --> 50:35.374
Yeah.

50:35.914 --> 50:40.179
The only thing I don't sound like is musical scores.

50:40.399 --> 50:42.761
We have a wonderful music library in them.

50:44.503 --> 50:49.829
And, you know, the Chinese money?

50:50.529 --> 50:52.451
Look at that.

50:52.471 --> 50:55.975
That's the money that Marco Polo was reporting on.

50:56.035 --> 50:58.037
Oh, my goodness.

50:58.878 --> 51:09.592
By the way, have you heard this wonderful argument about Marco Polo and the English librarian who said that Marco Polo was never in China?

51:10.373 --> 51:16.100
It is just a raging argument right now.

51:16.300 --> 51:18.923
Some people say Shakespeare didn't exist either.

51:18.943 --> 51:24.210
Marco Polo described this money in 1928

51:24.663 --> 51:30.972
Several specimens were discovered in Nanking, and this is one of the specimens.

51:30.992 --> 51:31.112
Wow.

51:31.793 --> 51:34.337
And is that something that was purchased or given?

51:34.637 --> 51:38.563
No, this was my husband's embarrassment.

51:38.623 --> 51:52.543
Mr. White had a half specimen, and we were at the dinner at somebody's house in Cleveland, and this gentleman was the first

51:53.013 --> 51:58.160
American consul in China with jurisdiction over to that.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.262
He was retired.

52:00.923 --> 52:11.637
And we were having dinner, and I was up on the mall between the suit and the entree, and that was on his mall.

52:12.678 --> 52:19.847
So he told me who he got it from, you know, somebody from Adlesham, somebody, a Chinese person.

52:20.637 --> 52:28.366
And so by the time we lost, I lost this place under my arm as a gift to the collection.

52:29.228 --> 52:30.589
My husband was outraged.

52:30.669 --> 52:41.002
He said, you do not go to dinners and you do not come away with the wild decoration.

52:41.022 --> 52:43.845
Don't you ever do that.

52:43.926 --> 52:45.628
But you got it, though.

52:46.208 --> 52:50.053
And some wonderful pictograph.

52:50.219 --> 52:52.563
Healing, it's important.

52:53.464 --> 52:54.806
The cause is good.

52:55.327 --> 53:03.801
Yes, but he took my husband a couple of, he's a very traditional European gentleman, and he was just absolutely awesome.

53:03.841 --> 53:05.444
He said, you can't do that.

53:06.105 --> 53:07.387
You're going to give me your card.

53:08.008 --> 53:10.331
I am, and there is Bob.

53:10.351 --> 53:11.573
Where are you staying?

53:11.593 --> 53:14.438
I'm staying at the home of Bob Jackson.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.287
Sorry, why don't you just say that again?

53:16.307 --> 53:44.728
Just for your information, the Cleveland Public Library does have very detailed criteria for rare books, and also a second set of criteria for research library materials, which are books which are not quite for the rare book collection, which are in general stacks, but which should be protected.

53:45.232 --> 53:48.856
because they have a potential of becoming rare.

53:48.996 --> 53:53.942
Do you collaborate with other professionals, library professionals in the United States?

53:53.982 --> 53:56.805
Is this something that you think is endemic throughout?

53:56.825 --> 53:57.566
Oh, yes.

53:58.467 --> 54:02.492
I served on many, many committees.

54:02.572 --> 54:06.356
But I'm sure you discussed this as a body of professionals.

54:06.616 --> 54:07.197
Oh, sure.

54:07.217 --> 54:09.300
You say this is something we all have to be doing.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.243
And many of them are doing it.

54:12.483 --> 54:14.125
Five years ago, I...

54:14.695 --> 54:26.210
gave a lecture at the American Library Association Rare Books Conference on our transfer policies of rare books from general staff.

54:27.532 --> 54:35.102
And yes, I'm quite active in both the art library field and also in the rare books field.

54:36.003 --> 54:37.986
Not as active as I would like to be,

54:38.253 --> 54:41.917
But there's a time limit.

54:42.318 --> 54:44.861
I will be in touch.

54:45.141 --> 54:46.703
I'll write you when I get home.

54:46.723 --> 54:54.793
The Farrakhan Foundation in London, that's a foundation for Islamic manuscripts.

54:54.813 --> 55:07.348
And in their annual newsletter, they reported that the most important library of Islamic manuscripts in the former Yugoslavia was saved during the troubles.

55:07.784 --> 55:09.207
And where did they cook them, do you know?

55:09.527 --> 55:12.112
They didn't see, exactly.

55:13.395 --> 55:19.767
I'm doing a whole chapter on this, not just Sarajevo, Islamic stuff, Cambodian stuff.

55:19.927 --> 55:22.632
I'm really interested in preserving things that are irreplaceable.

55:23.735 --> 55:26.620
And also destroying things that are irreplaceable.

55:26.836 --> 55:27.937
So Farrakhan.

55:28.178 --> 55:28.879
Farrakhan.

55:28.899 --> 55:29.720
You know what?

55:30.020 --> 55:34.566
I will send you with my packet a copy of that report.

55:35.528 --> 55:37.831
It's going to be a major chapter in my book.

55:37.911 --> 55:41.055
It's going to be a funny book.

55:41.756 --> 55:44.720
Arabic manuscript, Persian manuscript, Saludian manuscript.

55:44.740 --> 55:45.521
When I come back.

55:45.561 --> 55:48.285
Over 30 Pali manuscripts.

55:48.305 --> 55:48.605
30 which?

55:48.866 --> 55:53.332
Over 30 Pali manuscripts.

55:53.352 --> 55:53.432
Wow.

55:53.452 --> 55:55.054
And I have all that.

55:56.570 --> 56:01.300
Manuscripts and Tom Leap in the United States.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.703
Tom Leap, yeah.

56:02.783 --> 56:05.549
Four things to the Library of Congress, 19th century.

56:06.531 --> 56:06.611
Wow.

56:06.631 --> 56:09.938
Started for 30 bucks 15 years ago.
