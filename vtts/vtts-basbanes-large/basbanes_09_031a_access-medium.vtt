WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:09.044
I'm going to take notes, but I always say this is better because I have to look at George Georgians here.

00:09.064 --> 00:10.787
That's here, okay?

00:10.807 --> 00:12.429
Where is it comfortable for you when it's on you?

00:12.449 --> 00:15.574
Wherever it's done, my way there, right there, so I can see it.

00:16.315 --> 00:20.261
I ran Sandra Nichols' Found Dead through Nexus.

00:20.281 --> 00:29.335
Of course, nobody watching staff of elves was sending me any reviews, and then I discovered what I could do with Nexus.

00:29.896 --> 00:30.477
And so,

00:30.963 --> 00:39.036
Publication day came and I started every day putting my name up and see what I got under And nothing's being done to advertise the book.

00:39.056 --> 00:41.339
They took out one quarter page ad in the Boston Sunday Globe.

00:41.359 --> 00:43.062
That was it.

00:43.082 --> 00:49.292
I got on the Gordon Liddy show because Gordon remembers the guy who got him out Anyway

00:50.099 --> 00:53.966
Comes July, August, I'm screaming, get something done on this book.

00:53.986 --> 00:54.627
Nothing's happening.

00:56.310 --> 01:01.438
In November, I finally had a meeting with Dom, and I had 36 reviews of Sandra Nicholson's Top Nexus.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.904
32 of them were favorable.

01:04.924 --> 01:07.689
Over 20 of them were very favorable.

01:07.709 --> 01:11.095
There was this big confrontation down there, because I might want to play two of them.

01:11.986 --> 01:18.876
Jack McCray, Larchin, steps out of her office and asked if she might come along, and I said, sure.

01:18.896 --> 01:26.547
Then when I finished, Norman said, so if I have it right, George, you're saying that our publicity and marketing people talk about it.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.009
That's a quote, verbatim.

01:29.571 --> 01:31.053
And I said, yeah.

01:31.073 --> 01:37.082
He said, well, I can promise you that if you're still with us when your next book comes out, this won't happen again.

01:37.282 --> 01:40.146
And sure enough when gravity came out, it didn't.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.889
Nothing happened with gravity.

01:42.650 --> 01:47.558
It was a piece of treachery, that's all.

01:47.598 --> 01:49.621
The guy's word is not to be believed.

01:49.641 --> 01:53.107
And he destroyed a very nice scum.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.649
I'm going to tell you something.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.739
So tell me, George, you're writing about a sports agent.

02:00.759 --> 02:02.361
So you've written about politicians?

02:03.303 --> 02:06.268
That's not a redundancy.

02:07.249 --> 02:25.958
So why don't you tell me... Well, from time to time, instead of advancing the cause of great art in the United States, I want to have a little fun.

02:25.978 --> 02:30.085
And that's what this book was intended to be, some fun.

02:30.105 --> 02:31.707
I started it with...

02:31.940 --> 02:55.500
Frank play heading into the greatest state of The greatest state of Alex drew it who had been murdered And I better fact I pretty much finished the whole story and then I decided that I

02:55.733 --> 02:58.076
Alex really needed to be better known.

02:58.116 --> 03:01.040
Take some of this woman.

03:01.060 --> 03:01.720
I won't need all of that.

03:05.565 --> 03:06.667
And so I wrote part one.

03:08.048 --> 03:11.032
And then segued into part two after Alex has been done it.

03:11.052 --> 03:11.773
But by then you know it.

03:13.094 --> 03:17.580
And as I say, this is not intended to be a capitalist statement on the human condition.

03:17.620 --> 03:21.385
This is intended to be some fun.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.047
Good read on an airplane.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.690
Plus an evening at home.

03:26.007 --> 03:32.099
The people I've talked to before it was printed told me, with one accord, it's a good read.

03:33.121 --> 03:35.064
And I must say that not all of my books attend that.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.068
I'm a fairly demanding author.

03:37.088 --> 03:39.473
I regard reading as a participatory sport.

03:39.493 --> 03:43.079
And a lot of readers don't like to participate.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.482
Is this a participatory novel?

03:44.843 --> 03:45.484
I mean?

03:45.768 --> 03:50.795
Does this one break that particular mold?

03:50.955 --> 03:51.896
Oh, no, no.

03:52.577 --> 03:53.038
Let's face it.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.840
The purpose of fiction is to entertain.

03:56.002 --> 04:00.107
And when we lose sight of that, we get bad books.

04:00.988 --> 04:08.518
I'm not going to mention any authors by name of those two or three list makers out there who write great long books full of

04:08.903 --> 04:10.266
catalog content.

04:11.409 --> 04:12.210
And they're not fiction.

04:12.752 --> 04:22.654
All they are is evidence that the author can remember what sort of goods and services were available in the mid-1950s and 1960s and 1970s in America.

04:23.977 --> 04:25.039
And nothing really

04:25.643 --> 04:30.432
develops in the characters that are presented as people on a stage surrounded by these objects.

04:32.916 --> 04:38.066
The agent, just as every other one of my books, requires the reader to get involved.

04:38.086 --> 04:40.831
It's been described as a whodunit, but I don't really think it is that.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.397
Well, you know pretty early who did it.

04:44.938 --> 04:46.100
But the question is why.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.162
It's a whodunit.

04:48.863 --> 04:53.069
And that's what Frank Clay has to figure out.

04:56.694 --> 05:01.141
Is it important for us to detest the deceased?

05:01.401 --> 05:06.008
Oh no, quite unnecessary.

05:06.268 --> 05:12.137
The guy is a scoundrel and a ruffian, but he's a glamorous one.

05:12.556 --> 05:16.983
Like the one in the White House, a rather lovable scoundrel and ruffian.

05:17.223 --> 05:19.126
Only not on a scale.

05:21.169 --> 05:22.251
He's completely amoral.

05:23.814 --> 05:26.177
He's treacherous.

05:26.197 --> 05:32.387
And he's involved with pro athletes, big money, sex, drugs.

05:32.772 --> 05:45.770
And murder, what more can you ask?

05:46.371 --> 05:48.214
My characters do that.

05:49.656 --> 05:51.539
It's a funny thing.

05:51.559 --> 06:02.374
No reader that I know of has ever accused me of committing the acts that some of my characters have committed, such as murder, rape, savage assault and battery, mayhem, bank robbery.

06:02.810 --> 06:11.681
But I'm regularly held responsible for my character's views on race, sex, gender, age, and they're often politically incorrect.

06:12.202 --> 06:15.426
But I mean, you seem to deal with all of those subjects at this point.

06:15.546 --> 06:16.027
I try to.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.154
If any stone is left unturned, it was unintentional, I can assure you.

06:23.477 --> 06:27.602
More than one person has told me what my novels are, all of them.

06:28.173 --> 06:34.322
are stories about how things work.

06:34.422 --> 06:37.226
And the agent is that, par excellence.

06:38.088 --> 06:45.018
It is how the pro sports system in the 1990s, particularly in the late 1990s, now works.

06:45.038 --> 06:53.971
And it's a difference in kind from the way that pro sports worked when I was a boy, which would be 40 years ago, 50 years ago.

06:54.332 --> 06:56.695
The games that we watched then,

06:56.928 --> 07:01.595
have become spectacle stage, principally for TV.

07:01.795 --> 07:12.672
And the consequence of it is that the attachment that I think people are able to feel for their pro teams now is more factitious than anything else.

07:14.054 --> 07:17.900
Because the team is an abstract.

07:17.920 --> 07:25.551
The people in Atlanta who were devastated, and the people who were so exhilarated in Denver

07:26.459 --> 07:30.407
The police had to use tear gas on them.

07:30.427 --> 07:45.379
I'm not really rooting for the kind of team, the kind of joint enterprise that I and my contemporaries and my parents, my father and my grandfather before me, the kind of

07:45.815 --> 07:48.097
community identity that they had with the Red Sox.

07:48.438 --> 07:51.701
Because today's Red Sox are not going to be what yesterday's Red Sox were.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.562
Mo Vaughan has left.

07:52.642 --> 07:54.965
If they get another superstar, he'll be different.

07:54.985 --> 08:01.012
And we all know they'll all leave as soon as ever they can for more money or stay if they can get more money doing that.

08:01.032 --> 08:11.903
It was at least the illusion of a shared objective and a shared camaraderie with people we never met when we followed sports in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.744
It's not there anymore.

08:12.764 --> 08:15.147
It's about money now.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.859
Do you see this as a crime novel?

08:17.879 --> 08:18.160
As a what?

08:18.360 --> 08:18.981
A crime novel.

08:19.001 --> 08:20.164
Yes, this is a crime novel.

08:20.184 --> 08:22.549
So this is a return to your loose, isn't it?

08:22.569 --> 08:24.313
No, because I don't think Eddie Coyle was a crime novel.

08:24.373 --> 08:30.807
I think the only other crime novel I've written was The Mandeville Challenge, which significantly for Cremar,

08:32.272 --> 08:44.150
shared concern for the book publishing industry, sold out the first edition, the first printing between the time of publication in June and the royalty statements in October.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.772
And nobody at all took this aside.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.713
They had to print some more.

08:47.515 --> 08:49.217
As soon as they got their bait back, they stopped.

08:49.602 --> 09:08.646
I discovered in October, because I wasn't entitled to any money, because what you earn in the summer is a payable until April, which usually arrives in May.

09:08.706 --> 09:18.799
Therefore, I was not aware until the October after the Vanderbilt talent was printed and published in the spring, intended as a beach book.

09:18.998 --> 09:21.581
that, in fact, had earned back its advance already.

09:27.749 --> 09:33.457
So people who consider you or describe you as a crime writer, they've got it wrong.

09:33.937 --> 09:34.498
Not with this book.

09:34.879 --> 09:37.602
Not with this book, but I'm talking about over the arc of career.

09:37.722 --> 09:37.822
Sure.

09:38.003 --> 09:42.649
Crime novels are books about crime, and that's what this book is.

09:42.789 --> 09:45.192
Many of my characters in the other books commit crimes.

09:45.509 --> 09:46.871
but the stories are about them.

09:48.753 --> 09:53.398
This thing is linear.

09:54.700 --> 10:09.157
It has one objective, and it proceeds at the beginning, through the middle to the end of that objective, which is to find out first, why anyone would want to kill Alex Druitt, and then secondly, who caused them to derive that motive.

10:10.539 --> 10:11.500
Whereas the other books,

10:12.037 --> 10:15.906
I defy you to describe change of gravity in one sentence like that.

10:16.647 --> 10:20.216
Change of gravity is about a change in the way the political system works.

10:21.178 --> 10:26.991
And one of great moments in magnitude that occurred between the time that Danny Hilliard first started running for office

10:27.140 --> 10:30.024
and the time when the story took place in 1996-7.

10:30.224 --> 10:39.818
You know, we've often heard it said that Boston is a city where drink is mad at sports, politics, and revenge.

10:39.878 --> 10:40.419
Yes.

10:40.659 --> 10:42.862
And most of my books are about all of those subjects.

10:42.882 --> 10:47.629
And would you say that you try to reflect this Boston persona?

10:47.649 --> 10:49.912
Absolutely.

10:49.932 --> 10:52.776
I have, you know now who said it, but I agree with you.

10:53.178 --> 10:58.411
I'm not sure I ever would have written the kind of novels I'd written.

10:58.432 --> 10:58.953
I have written.

11:00.316 --> 11:04.046
If I had lived most of my life in any other synagogue.

11:04.066 --> 11:09.921
Because everything is so beautifully calibrated here.

11:10.238 --> 11:13.241
the balance of those three interests.

11:15.704 --> 11:28.679
One review of the agent is composed by a guy who was the editor of a paper, one of the alternate newspapers, when I was the Globe's literary critic, well, the journalism critic.

11:29.620 --> 11:34.385
And he explained in his review that I made a great deal of fun out of his newspaper.

11:36.627 --> 11:39.891
And then he explained further that when I wrote The Rat on Fire,

11:40.394 --> 11:44.900
I preempted the much better novel he would have written about arson for hire.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.441
I don't know how I did that, but there you go.

11:47.843 --> 11:51.367
And finally, he explained why those were the reasons why he disliked The Agent.

11:52.689 --> 11:53.510
Follow that, if you will.

11:53.971 --> 11:55.312
I can reduce it for you if you like.

11:55.472 --> 11:56.313
It's called Envy.

11:57.875 --> 12:04.123
But it's Boston.

12:05.656 --> 12:07.798
Maybe I'm wrong, but is this your first sports book?

12:08.880 --> 12:16.949
Well, of course, I wrote a nonfiction memoir, The Progress of the Seasons, about the way my father and my grandfather and I thought about the Red Sox.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.632
And sports-related novels.

12:20.813 --> 12:23.616
No, Victories was about a retired Red Sox relief pitcher.

12:25.478 --> 12:31.045
I've used sports characters before, and Trust was about a guy who'd gone to jail for fixing basketball games when he played.

12:31.405 --> 12:32.687
So you found it.

12:32.707 --> 12:33.047
Yeah.

12:34.310 --> 12:35.912
How old are you now, George?

12:36.373 --> 12:36.553
59.

12:36.573 --> 12:36.774
59.

12:37.334 --> 12:39.317
I'll be 56 in a few months.

12:39.738 --> 12:43.583
I'm trying to convince myself that a cataract is a sign of late adolescence.

12:44.605 --> 12:46.668
I'm having trouble.

12:46.688 --> 12:49.492
Well, I used to have perfect eyesight.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.076
Each year, the glasses get stronger.

12:52.957 --> 12:55.341
You had it in one eye?

12:55.361 --> 12:55.661
Red eye.

12:56.943 --> 13:02.511
I'm told I have another candidate in the left eye, but I'm going to deal with this one first, and soon.

13:03.149 --> 13:13.701
1972 is, well, here we are approaching 27 years, right?

13:13.721 --> 13:15.764
Correct.

13:15.804 --> 13:16.685
Easily, easily.

13:17.546 --> 13:23.012
Oh, they're never going to shut me up.

13:23.032 --> 13:25.195
It'll take six guys in a long black car to do that.

13:26.997 --> 13:31.182
But as a result of getting mauled in 97 by my former publishers,

13:32.107 --> 13:48.542
I thought for quite a while that maybe my publishing career was over, that I was going to be dependent on the kindness of strangers, like Planck DuBois, that I'd be traveling as a mendicant author from university press to university press, trying to persuade them to publish my stuff.

13:48.883 --> 13:49.783
I didn't look forward to it.

13:50.364 --> 13:51.765
Authors need print.

13:52.846 --> 13:57.831
I mean, you really weren't fearful that you would be a publisher.

13:58.271 --> 13:58.992
Yes, I was.

13:59.242 --> 14:03.647
I was fearful that I would not find a commercial book.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.308
I was terrified.

14:04.328 --> 14:08.753
It would not be too much to say that I was in despair over it.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.015
You bet 28 books?

14:11.035 --> 14:16.522
That in this market that we have today is not an advantage, it's a handicap.

14:16.542 --> 14:23.950
I had published 28 books, and I haven't been on the bestseller list of the New York Times since 1974.

14:26.056 --> 14:28.119
Today, the publishers are looking for the big score.

14:28.179 --> 14:30.121
They're not interested in the Midwest author anymore.

14:31.263 --> 14:40.114
One knowledgeable fellow about American publishing said that I ought to tell my students at Boston University that their prospects are these.

14:40.134 --> 14:46.782
If they can manage to get a book accepted, their publisher will probably put out two more, seeing if they can write a bestseller.

14:47.183 --> 14:51.195
And if they count, they'll double them.

14:51.556 --> 14:57.312
Well, the late Joe Fox, who dumped me from Random House, is the guy

14:57.477 --> 15:04.007
He told John Irving that he should take the world according to Garth to another house, because he didn't see that they published four of his books.

15:05.450 --> 15:06.050
Good.

15:06.071 --> 15:17.488
And I don't think, you know, I wasn't nearly as dramatic an example, but he tossed me off my ass and said that your book won't sell 3,000 copies.

15:17.508 --> 15:20.413
Who shall he ever turn down the fence of Eddie Coyle on the ground?

15:20.714 --> 15:23.518
You remember these things, don't you?

15:23.538 --> 15:27.663
You know, of all the... This is immodest to say, but it's true.

15:27.683 --> 15:49.472
Of all the hundreds of reviews that I've had that have been favorable, and some of them have been extremely favorable and I haven't framed in my house, the ones I remember best are the stinkers, the ad pressers, the ones in which the reviewer tells the reader of the review how much better his book would be if only he had written it.

15:52.912 --> 15:55.776
The ones that take you to task for what your characters did or said.

15:58.859 --> 16:05.668
And in my case, the ones that say that, of course, it's obvious I don't actually make this stuff up, I steal it on a grand jury transcript.

16:11.115 --> 16:17.703
You must have a shelf at home of about 29 books up there, all the foreign editions.

16:17.723 --> 16:19.425
Two shelves.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.223
It's getting crowded there.

16:21.544 --> 16:24.431
I've got all my magazines, or most of my magazine publications up there.

16:25.955 --> 16:28.160
I've got the doctoral dissertations written on my stuff.

16:29.243 --> 16:30.265
I'm as vain as an angel.

16:30.727 --> 16:31.529
That's my life there.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.313
Do you see it as an art?

16:33.563 --> 16:35.546
As an archive?

16:35.746 --> 16:36.707
No, an archive.

16:36.727 --> 16:38.710
Your career, can you follow it?

16:38.730 --> 16:43.797
Can you trace how these PhD candidates perceive your career?

16:43.817 --> 16:53.170
I have the same reaction to the PhD candidates and the critical essays in the scholarly magazines that I have for the newspaper critics.

16:53.611 --> 16:59.419
I am again and again astonished at what conclusions readers form for my books.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.590
Of course, I encourage that, because I don't make judgments on my characters.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.232
And I don't tell you what I think the events mean.

17:05.354 --> 17:08.037
And I don't establish hierarchies of moral value.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.901
That's your job.

17:10.921 --> 17:13.445
And there was one guy in one newspaper.

17:14.246 --> 17:15.668
I don't know what it was.

17:15.988 --> 17:18.551
I think it was the Free Press, but it might have been the news in Detroit.

17:20.013 --> 17:23.398
When Cogan's trade came out, at a reprint of your own,

17:23.648 --> 17:24.209
1974.

17:24.269 --> 17:30.276
Do you recall Jackie Cogan as a contract hitman for the Mafia?

17:31.378 --> 17:41.491
This guy said that this was clearly, this book was clearly a Christ allegory, with Jackie Cogan as Christ, expiating sin by death.

17:43.053 --> 17:48.880
And that was different from the Christ story that I heard, which Christ expiated sin with his own death.

17:49.332 --> 17:50.695
Not with the death of the sinner.

17:50.895 --> 17:59.214
That was just the most egregious example.

17:59.254 --> 18:03.082
Each time out, are you looking for... What are you looking for?

18:03.102 --> 18:05.367
What are you trying to accomplish each time out?

18:05.748 --> 18:07.071
I want to find out how the story ends.

18:08.047 --> 18:14.789
I begin at the beginning and I write until I reach the end.

18:14.829 --> 18:20.908
Sometimes I keep on writing after I reach the end and my editor has to say, we're not going to go to this 15th chapter.

18:21.209 --> 18:25.614
You continue to be justly celebrated for your dialogue.

18:26.314 --> 18:35.324
I feel, however, in this book, you really have structured the narrative a little bit more along, perhaps, traditional lines.

18:35.364 --> 18:35.904
Yeah.

18:35.924 --> 18:37.646
This book is much more overtly plotted.

18:39.528 --> 18:44.954
It was really something of a problem book, a state of problem and solve it.

18:44.974 --> 18:45.655
I never do that.

18:45.735 --> 18:50.760
I've only done that in one other occasion, and that was with the man that will tell it.

18:52.597 --> 19:11.230
But it's not, in passing, a story about the evolution of politics in America since World War II, and it's not a story about the evolution of media in America since World War II, or maybe more likely since the Vietnam War.

19:11.480 --> 19:20.148
disquisition on a history of moral values and changes and the consequences of those changes in America since World War II.

19:20.168 --> 19:27.195
It is not what John O'Hara said, the history of times, only in quite anecdotal form.

19:28.497 --> 19:41.149
This one is a story about a problem to be solved and the guy who solves it and the man whose murder was the cause of the problem.

19:41.517 --> 19:44.702
Did you start with the character or what was the concept of the story?

19:44.742 --> 19:45.122
Concept.

19:46.384 --> 19:49.469
I invented the character to go with it.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.194
And I invented Alex Druin as I had never before.

19:53.575 --> 19:55.117
Well, yes, I have in the Mandible Tower.

19:56.018 --> 20:01.867
I invented the character of Alex Druin with the deliberate intention of making him to be a fascinating rogue.

20:01.887 --> 20:05.652
And the reviewers have been kind enough to say I succeeded so well I shouldn't have killed him.

20:05.767 --> 20:10.353
But it was essential.

20:10.453 --> 20:18.543
He had to die.

20:18.644 --> 20:22.408
I deliberately did not see Jerry Maguire until I finished the agent.

20:22.428 --> 20:25.372
I didn't see Jerry Maguire until February 21st, 1998.

20:25.412 --> 20:32.922
And the reason I know that is because when I returned it the next day, as I crossed an intersection, my beautiful BMW got torn.

20:35.045 --> 20:38.710
No kidding.

20:38.750 --> 20:39.992
No kidding.

20:40.092 --> 20:49.345
It was a 635 CSI in 1987 with 30,000 miles on it that I bought in 1996.

20:49.365 --> 20:55.534
The car's been out of production now since 1989.

20:55.554 --> 20:56.596
It broke my hat.

20:56.616 --> 20:58.619
I can see it.

20:58.639 --> 21:01.703
It was a beautiful automobile.

21:01.723 --> 21:03.786
It also broke a couple of ribs.

21:03.766 --> 21:07.692
So on that score, I'm not entirely upset about that.

21:07.712 --> 21:09.014
I was turning left in the intersection.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.536
A guy came out of the hill, up the hill.

21:10.576 --> 21:13.721
He wasn't looking where he was going.

21:14.743 --> 21:21.673
He was going too fast to hit me.

21:23.628 --> 21:28.594
The next book is done.

21:30.537 --> 21:33.681
The working title now is McKeach, End of Day.

21:34.102 --> 21:37.846
McKeach, M-C capital K-E-A-C-H, The End of Day.

21:38.828 --> 21:42.953
That's about going back to my roots.

21:43.574 --> 21:45.197
Boston gangsters.

21:45.858 --> 21:48.102
And the twilight of their era.

21:49.083 --> 21:52.769
Or the era of the gangsters that I knew in.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.834
That world is coming from a close.

21:55.854 --> 21:56.756
What's replacing it?

21:58.499 --> 22:03.728
He's no way near as civilized.

22:03.748 --> 22:05.030
You've got the gangbangs now.

22:06.873 --> 22:08.215
All kinds of wild gunplay.

22:09.545 --> 22:15.053
But in the days of the mob, when I started interviewing him, he was persecuting him.

22:15.073 --> 22:16.695
How finished?

22:16.715 --> 22:19.739
Back in the late 60s.

22:19.759 --> 22:22.182
There were rules.

22:22.202 --> 22:24.686
He only shot somebody because he'd done something to punish him.

22:24.966 --> 22:25.667
And they shot him.

22:25.687 --> 22:26.869
They didn't shoot his wife and his wife.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.231
They didn't shoot his wife and his daughters.

22:28.471 --> 22:31.435
Occasionally, they had to shoot a girlfriend who was present when they were shooting him.

22:31.776 --> 22:33.478
Because, of course, you didn't want to leave her around.

22:33.518 --> 22:37.864
You know, luck on the draw.

22:38.857 --> 22:44.203
Death knell, I think.

22:44.223 --> 22:46.506
And I don't mean this in any life-handed sort of fashion.

22:47.387 --> 22:51.872
It was when Assistant Attorney General Paul McLaughlin got gunned down in West Roxbury on his way home.

22:52.553 --> 22:53.354
At the train station?

22:53.374 --> 22:54.395
Yeah, at the train station.

22:54.435 --> 22:56.758
I used that in the next novel.

22:57.979 --> 22:59.721
This is something that's so untoward.

23:01.063 --> 23:02.545
You never kill the prosecutor.

23:02.565 --> 23:03.666
And get away with it, too.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.521
So far, they claim they've got the guy, but they don't have evidence to prove it.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.924
They've got him on something else that he's never going to see the latter day on.

23:09.984 --> 23:10.825
Was it a kid?

23:10.905 --> 23:12.047
Yeah, a 15-year-old.

23:12.748 --> 23:14.711
Was it him they were looking for?

23:15.031 --> 23:20.018
He had been, the DAG has obtained a case against him, got him indicted.

23:21.860 --> 23:27.628
And he, it was his first major offense.

23:27.980 --> 23:30.024
He and another pal.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.809
For shooting some other guy.

23:33.029 --> 23:34.793
So they really did target this guy?

23:35.253 --> 23:37.858
Well, the judge released him on bail.

23:41.044 --> 23:48.698
You know, you wonder how the judge can find that there's no substantial risk that this man will be a danger to society if he's released.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.203
When he's charged with murder.

23:52.803 --> 23:55.019
So, you know, these guys have the attention.

23:56.349 --> 23:58.122
They have no concept of time.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.002
in extension.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.105
They have only a concept of time as it is right now.

24:04.007 --> 24:08.473
And his case was coming out to be tried by McLaughlin.

24:08.493 --> 24:13.139
And so in his mind, killing McLaughlin would prevent his convictions.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.443
All it did was prevent McLaughlin from trying the case.

24:15.483 --> 24:16.864
The case is still going to be tried.

24:17.926 --> 24:19.528
The underlying case, I think it has been tried.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.332
As a matter of fact, he was convicted.

24:22.352 --> 24:23.333
And he's going to be in.

24:24.511 --> 24:32.989
The only time he's going to see the sun is when he's in the exercise yard, unless we get some other softy in there for governor who pardoned him.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.194
But that was just unheard of when I was chasing him out.

24:35.415 --> 24:40.546
I would get calls from informers, which I always thought should be informers, but there you go.

24:40.566 --> 24:41.688
I would be the poor man, right?

24:41.728 --> 24:42.570
They were talking to me.

24:43.715 --> 24:48.385
I would get calls when I had been to the north end for dinner.

24:48.425 --> 24:49.748
I just want coffee for me.

24:49.768 --> 24:53.116
They're asking me how I like the veal.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.403
I had a plate on my Camaro.

24:56.423 --> 24:57.044
It was at U.S.

24:57.064 --> 24:57.826
security's office.

24:57.846 --> 24:59.209
It was supposedly

24:59.189 --> 25:03.395
made you invisible from speed traps to state troopers.

25:03.555 --> 25:05.238
You kind of used a scene like that in here, too.

25:05.258 --> 25:05.498
Yeah.

25:06.900 --> 25:15.852
And there was one night after I tried a murder case that I lost, and it wasn't my fault, truly, because I had told the prosecutor to obtain the indictment, not to indict it.

25:15.872 --> 25:18.256
We didn't have the evidence.

25:18.276 --> 25:19.798
After the trial, the case had been severed.

25:19.818 --> 25:20.619
There were three men involved.

25:21.701 --> 25:24.825
And I got the two remaining after the first guy had been tried to quit it.

25:25.548 --> 25:32.983
And after the trial was over, the first guy's brother came up to me outside the courthouse and said, you tried a good case, kid.

25:33.003 --> 25:36.771
You tried my brother, you would have gotten him.

25:36.791 --> 25:42.983
So a year goes by, and sort of a ritual I had with friends

25:43.469 --> 25:46.113
We're celebrating an anniversary down in Providence where he lives.

25:48.016 --> 25:49.339
He and his wife and I and mine.

25:49.459 --> 25:51.122
And it was my turn to pick up the check.

25:52.544 --> 25:53.405
And there wasn't any check.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.729
This is Dr. Camille's Roman Gardens.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.918
And I said to the waiter, but he needs to be taken care of.

26:00.938 --> 26:03.161
And the waiter said, over there.

26:03.181 --> 26:04.223
And there was the guy's brother.

26:04.924 --> 26:09.612
These gangbangers don't do that.

26:10.216 --> 26:14.261
There's an element of respect here, too, isn't there?

26:14.281 --> 26:18.465
There's an element of respect here that's... Respetata, please.

26:18.525 --> 26:18.846
Yes.

26:20.047 --> 26:21.809
It's almost a chivalry.

26:21.829 --> 26:21.909
War.

26:23.871 --> 26:25.994
But it was, everybody knew what the rules were.

26:26.354 --> 26:29.117
I had one defendant who was kind enough to kill himself.

26:29.137 --> 26:35.805
He got all loaded up on booze and pills one New Year's Eve and hit the wall of the Central Lattery in Boston.

26:35.825 --> 26:36.726
Central Lattery underpest.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.649
Who engaged me in a conversation

26:40.000 --> 26:42.162
during a free trial appearance up in Salem.

26:42.703 --> 26:45.986
He said, nice looking wife you got.

26:46.206 --> 26:46.626
Nice house.

26:48.468 --> 26:49.709
Good kids, huh?

26:49.729 --> 26:50.050
Dog.

26:53.273 --> 26:56.136
So I went to my investigators and I told them what Frankie had said.

26:57.497 --> 26:58.738
And they put the word out on the street.

26:59.319 --> 27:04.263
Anything, anything happens to Higgins or his family.

27:04.283 --> 27:06.445
And all you guys are coming in every day for pictures.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.067
Every day within a round job.

27:08.266 --> 27:10.208
Every single day, pictures and prints.

27:11.049 --> 27:11.630
Nothing happened.

27:12.191 --> 27:13.192
He was off the reservation.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.035
There isn't any reservation, though.

27:16.075 --> 27:20.981
Unfortunately, you look at this, how about this little eight-year-old boy down in Connecticut?

27:21.802 --> 27:23.564
Who's going to be a witness.

27:23.584 --> 27:24.886
And the guy who shot him.

27:24.926 --> 27:27.049
Where's the system that's supposed to be?

27:27.389 --> 27:31.013
Just because the mother says we don't want protection, so that's sufficient.

27:31.794 --> 27:34.037
It's pretty hard to give protection, but of course the trouble is.

27:34.270 --> 27:44.490
There's no rule that says you can't surveil somebody who's not in custody and not under suspicion of anything.

27:44.510 --> 27:51.824
There's no rule that says the police can't provide extra protection for a citizen even though the citizen doesn't want it.

27:52.265 --> 27:55.030
I would think so.

27:55.415 --> 27:59.060
That to me is one of the most heartbreaking stories.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.643
It certainly is.

28:00.783 --> 28:06.632
I've seen a sweet little kid who's doing the right thing.

28:06.652 --> 28:06.812
Yeah.

28:06.832 --> 28:07.193
Strag.

28:07.213 --> 28:08.735
Where's the system?

28:08.755 --> 28:15.826
I mean, the guy is, forget him, but... But you see, there's the pattern again.

28:15.846 --> 28:19.431
The person who pulled off that murder of that little boy...

28:19.917 --> 28:25.665
doesn't see that there will be a prosecution for that murder, too, because somebody will talk for that one.

28:25.685 --> 28:28.569
Especially if somebody starts putting money up for this, too.

28:28.869 --> 28:31.914
I'm surprised Bill Cosby hasn't come up with $100,000 or something.

28:31.934 --> 28:49.738
Or if somebody else, somebody who knows who did it and has probative evidence admissible in court gets his own tail in a narrow crack and encounters either a cop or a prosecutor, doesn't matter which guy, with a thumb stroke and start in on him.

28:52.233 --> 28:54.717
That's how sometimes these things are?

28:54.737 --> 28:55.878
Well, it's usually the only way.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.923
Do you miss that stuff?

28:58.943 --> 29:00.545
Yes.

29:00.565 --> 29:00.946
Sure I do.

29:01.226 --> 29:02.828
I loved it.

29:02.848 --> 29:04.110
And how about the private law practice?

29:04.150 --> 29:05.653
That's been history for some time.

29:05.753 --> 29:11.581
I went to Joe Toro's unveiling of his portrait last Friday in the federal court.

29:11.621 --> 29:14.065
He's completed his term as chief judge.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.048
And I was one of Joe's assistants when he was U.S.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.311
attorney.

29:18.331 --> 29:21.075
And the courtroom was full of guys I tried against.

29:21.680 --> 29:26.509
guys I worked with and for, and I rather envy them.

29:26.529 --> 29:29.955
But when I told them this, they said with one accord, don't.

29:31.257 --> 29:32.800
He said, it's changed so much now.

29:33.281 --> 29:34.964
We'll drive you nuts.

29:35.284 --> 29:45.983
When I was prosecuting, if one lawyer lied to another once, that was the end of it.

29:46.233 --> 29:57.223
If I had arraign your client court, since I know you, we've tried cases before, your word is good, you would ask the judge for 20 days to file special motions, which is a month.

29:57.243 --> 29:58.364
And I would say no objections.

29:59.145 --> 30:09.254
And in due course, you would file motions to disclose all evidence, exculpatory motions to disclose all scientific evidence, names of witnesses, all scientific reports, so on prior to the night.

30:10.214 --> 30:12.937
And I would not object to any of them at the hearing date.

30:12.957 --> 30:15.379
So there wouldn't be a hearing date.

30:16.203 --> 30:21.611
The fact of the matter is, after the arraignment, on that day, I would say to you, come on down to the office and I'll give you the file.

30:22.793 --> 30:24.396
And anything you wanted in it, you could copy.

30:25.217 --> 30:27.180
Unless it was the name of a confidential foreman.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.103
I couldn't give you that, because he'd been wiped out, maybe.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.627
You wouldn't do it, but your client might.

30:32.027 --> 30:36.775
But I would give you essentially what was my case, and say, show me how you're going to beat me.

30:36.795 --> 30:40.340
And if you could find a way, then you would say, I think I can beat you.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.943
You wouldn't necessarily tell me how you're going to do it.

30:41.963 --> 30:43.425
We might just disagree on these.

30:44.283 --> 30:47.066
effect on the jury of a given piece of testimony or evidence.

30:48.948 --> 30:55.835
But if you agreed that there wasn't any way to beat the case, and your client was sensible, which not all clients are, then the case would end in a play.

30:57.057 --> 31:01.001
And he'd end up getting less time than he would have gotten if he'd gone to trial and gotten convicted.

31:01.021 --> 31:08.409
Now, often the client was intractable, and he wouldn't take his lawyers' considered opinion that the better thing to do would be plea.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.252
He would insist on a trial in the theory that

31:11.992 --> 31:13.014
He had nothing to lose.

31:13.054 --> 31:16.619
You know, if you've got a record out to hear, why not take a shot?

31:16.659 --> 31:17.501
There's logic in that.

31:17.521 --> 31:17.681
Yeah.

31:18.262 --> 31:24.352
And so we'd try the case, and you'd get convicted and get the maximum.

31:24.372 --> 31:34.969
But if I had a case involving a gentleman who knew, and I suspected that he knew, who killed that little boy, I would sketch him.

31:34.989 --> 31:36.391
I would invite him into the office.

31:36.411 --> 31:37.573
He'd bring his lawyer with him if he wanted to.

31:38.174 --> 31:38.775
Most of them did.

31:39.599 --> 31:44.344
I would tell him exactly what was going to happen to him.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.847
Unless he told me what I wanted to know.

31:48.309 --> 31:49.210
And that would be his choice.

31:49.670 --> 31:53.474
The question is, is he more afraid of me than he is of the guys who will kill him if he does what I want him to do?

31:54.456 --> 31:56.137
Quite often they were more afraid of the guys who would kill him.

31:56.318 --> 31:57.379
Who are the guys who would kill him?

31:57.519 --> 32:00.702
Well, for one thing, the guy who killed the little boy.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.708
He's already murdered one witness, or one of his pals.

32:06.886 --> 32:10.375
But that's really what it comes down to, the balance of terror.

32:10.395 --> 32:13.062
That's great.

32:13.082 --> 32:14.766
That wouldn't be a bad title, you know.

32:15.568 --> 32:18.516
Now that I've said it, I think you're right.

32:19.053 --> 32:19.654
Don't forget it.

32:20.836 --> 32:22.559
I'll write it down right now, being over 40.

32:24.562 --> 32:26.385
Maybe I changed the key to your balance.

32:26.525 --> 32:27.527
It's not bad, is it?

32:27.547 --> 32:28.688
It's very good.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.069
It's yours.

32:29.089 --> 32:33.516
This will be one of those affinity stories that goes into the PhD students of the future.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.700
I can come up with a good title for everybody except myself.

32:38.784 --> 32:42.611
That is a great title.

32:42.651 --> 32:45.415
It was originally used when I first saw it.

32:47.167 --> 32:52.033
to describe the mutual assured destruction capabilities of the U.S.

32:52.093 --> 32:52.453
and Soviet Union.

32:52.473 --> 32:56.418
But I've never seen it as a balance of mad, you know, mutual assured destruction.

32:56.798 --> 32:57.999
But it was called a balance of terror.

32:58.360 --> 32:58.840
That's nice.

32:59.001 --> 32:59.461
I'm going to do it.

32:59.501 --> 33:01.864
Now that, you can do a LexNet search on it.

33:01.884 --> 33:03.686
Or you can do a Harvard search on it.

33:03.746 --> 33:04.347
I'll do LexNet.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.309
I'll do a title search.

33:06.369 --> 33:08.351
Well, the choice of enemies had been used before.

33:08.431 --> 33:08.972
I used it.

33:09.712 --> 33:11.855
So what?

33:11.875 --> 33:12.816
So what?

33:13.157 --> 33:14.518
Exactly.

33:14.779 --> 33:19.365
And it hasn't been used McKeach, a balance of terror, or the balance of terror.

33:19.385 --> 33:20.627
I like it.

33:20.647 --> 33:23.370
There was a discourse between two cops in the story.

33:24.432 --> 33:29.819
One of them was a PD Boston superintendent, and the other one's an MSP detective lieutenant inspector.

33:30.780 --> 33:31.281
And that's

33:31.615 --> 33:39.288
That's what they use the balance of terrorists the gist of the discussion they have I like that Alex is a bibliophile.

33:39.769 --> 33:43.075
Oh, yeah He is so respects his books.

33:43.095 --> 33:55.716
He doesn't even open No, I had I do know of a person who furnished his home with a library

33:56.320 --> 34:00.245
It's a brand bookstore in New York.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.007
They sell them by the foot, don't they?

34:02.287 --> 34:04.210
She sells them and she rents them by the foot.

34:04.430 --> 34:04.790
Rents them?

34:04.971 --> 34:05.952
She rents them.

34:06.012 --> 34:11.479
To soap operas, to parties, to, you know, you want Levin Bond?

34:12.460 --> 34:13.341
No, I wrote about it.

34:13.361 --> 34:14.202
I've written about it.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.285
In fact, I might even just put it in a new book.

34:17.626 --> 34:19.729
Let's see.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.451
I think I've got my lead here.

34:21.471 --> 34:26.277
I think the lead is, you know, revenge, politics, and sports.

34:26.543 --> 34:29.051
You basically covered them all.

34:30.918 --> 34:38.764
Well, the Boston Three, of course, predictably, given the chance in this heritage of this town, the Boston Three really

34:39.031 --> 34:44.139
And it would be at least a quartet in any other city, but sex would be included too.

34:44.479 --> 34:47.544
In Boston, we have no sex, just guilt without sex.

34:47.744 --> 34:48.806
Why is that, would you say?

34:49.147 --> 34:49.908
Well, it's unpopular.

34:49.928 --> 34:53.613
For my readers in Toledo and Eugene, I'm in Salt Lake City.

34:53.633 --> 34:57.900
I think it was Chesterton who said that, Bill O'Shaw, I believe, who said that the

34:58.893 --> 35:02.656
Pleasure is momentary, the position is ridiculous, and the expense is enormous.

35:02.776 --> 35:03.257
That's why.

35:04.798 --> 35:10.903
And this is Boston.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.907
Fiction is still the main event.

35:18.530 --> 35:19.070
Well, I don't know.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.912
I've been looking for a nonfiction project.

35:20.932 --> 35:28.478
I said to my new embers last spring that when I finished the Y2K book, which is not about Y2K,

35:29.740 --> 35:33.425
I had hoped to get a non-fiction project.

35:33.446 --> 35:39.715
Well, what I was dandling was the idea of doing something that Peter Gathers in that library of contemporary thought.

35:40.796 --> 35:42.579
That's enough, that's enough.

35:42.599 --> 35:50.751
Because it's short, and it pays very nicely, and I thought it would be a good change of pace.

35:51.152 --> 35:58.583
But none of the ideas that I had suggested to him has piqued his interest, and the one idea that he proposed to me, I didn't like.

35:59.660 --> 36:07.014
So this morning I started another one of those, what would probably turn out to be a 68,000 word short story that I won't be able to sell anyway.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.445
Teaching, you've been teaching at BU now for... Since 88.

36:12.465 --> 36:14.248
88, I'd love to say 10 years.

36:14.829 --> 36:15.531
This is my 11th.

36:15.831 --> 36:17.014
I was on medical leave last year.

36:17.094 --> 36:17.915
You're enjoying it still?

36:17.935 --> 36:18.276
I love it.

36:18.492 --> 36:20.954
And the classes this year are both of them full of pistols.

36:20.974 --> 36:24.838
And are the graduate courses, undergraduate courses?

36:24.898 --> 36:28.082
EN 305 is the evening seminar, and that is eclectic.

36:28.142 --> 36:33.287
It draws from across the university and from people who are simply walk-ons off campus.

36:33.307 --> 36:39.373
And 405 is the afternoon course, and that's generally upperclassmen.

36:39.393 --> 36:41.675
But I have had from time to time a graduate student.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.398
That is the more demanding of the two seminars.

36:45.256 --> 36:46.898
How's the writing?

36:46.918 --> 36:47.499
Good?

36:47.579 --> 36:48.761
It's surprisingly good.

36:48.781 --> 36:53.147
The commonplace that you hear about it is they only know six stories.

36:54.108 --> 36:55.330
How I lost my virginity.

36:55.931 --> 36:57.153
How I tried to and failed.

36:58.675 --> 37:01.479
Why I hate my mother, why I hate my father, old man dying, old woman back.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.161
That hasn't been the case.

37:04.964 --> 37:15.178
A couple of years ago, there was a woman who set up a truly, to me, novel method of getting

37:15.513 --> 37:17.275
considerable use out of poisonous snakes.

37:18.797 --> 37:27.429
And just last week, one of my students in the afternoon session had a story about a woman who had married Henry Richards and loved Henry.

37:28.650 --> 37:32.035
Loved him so passionately that when each of their three boys was born, they named him Henry.

37:33.116 --> 37:34.598
Just like George Foreman.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.542
But it was more than a takeoff on George Foreman.

37:37.562 --> 37:39.044
I don't know if you'd ever heard of George Foreman.

37:39.425 --> 37:43.410
It was an excellent white trash story.

37:44.133 --> 37:45.795
And it involved real-life characters.

37:46.356 --> 37:53.926
One of them, well, the victim of the story, who he was killed, was an organizer for Ann Richards in her campaign for governor of Texas.

37:53.966 --> 38:01.356
So it was, without any exaggeration, about real people and irrational behavior.

38:01.396 --> 38:04.821
It was an excellent story, and I told her to take out the section number.

38:04.841 --> 38:09.267
She had named each section, and she changed voices, changed points of view, which was all right, because it was that kind of story.

38:10.008 --> 38:11.390
These quick cuts, as they'd say in Hollywood.

38:12.211 --> 38:12.992
I told her, take those...

38:13.698 --> 38:39.874
look those roman numerals out of there just leave two dashes two lines of space between each section they'll get it and start sending it out getting beaten up like all the other aspirin aspiring writers you know as you talk about this cuts do you see do you see these novels visually do you consider no i hear them and maybe that hurts you with the movies not maybe that hurts me with the movies because john frankenheimer said to me once you've got to learn to write five pages

38:40.529 --> 38:42.632
in which no character art is more than 20 words.

38:43.734 --> 38:45.016
That's like telling me I can't write.

38:45.978 --> 38:47.480
Because my characters tell the stories.

38:49.163 --> 39:00.682
There is one screenwriter, Joel Oliansky, who has done some absolutely magical adaptations, screen adaptations of the Jerry Kennedy books, two of them.

39:00.702 --> 39:02.825
But it's been hard to sell them.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.107
I think there's going to be a

39:04.525 --> 39:09.770
New Birth of Freedom for people who write the kind of novels that I wrote.

39:09.790 --> 39:12.372
I think probably Craig Noble would be included in this group.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.615
I think probably Ward just will be included in it.

39:15.635 --> 39:20.540
I would bank money on it that John Updike is already getting for it.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.003
But we go to six X channels, what we've got now.

39:25.905 --> 39:33.132
They will be compelled, some of them, to allocate their resources and target their programming to the kind of people

39:33.449 --> 39:37.314
You'll read books by John Updike and Craig Nova and George Higgins and Nick Besman.

39:38.576 --> 39:38.977
Well, they will.

39:38.997 --> 39:39.517
They'll have to.

39:40.098 --> 39:42.742
Your chances are probably better than mine are because you write nonfiction.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.925
A&E and Bravo lap that stuff up.

39:46.828 --> 39:47.829
And they'll have to do it.

39:47.989 --> 39:48.911
And they'll have to tap.

39:48.951 --> 39:54.098
There's an audience there that is currently being uncircised.

39:54.118 --> 39:57.162
And that is the people over 45.

39:57.800 --> 40:04.146
who aren't going to be buying dishes, who aren't going to be buying houses, who aren't going to be buying furniture, because we've got all that shit, appliances.

40:05.167 --> 40:09.231
But we don't have Cadillacs that never wear out.

40:10.172 --> 40:12.875
We don't have BMWs that never wear out.

40:13.836 --> 40:26.068
The goods that we have that are made by such people as automobile manufacturers and golf club manufacturers, we tend to replace sometimes with the computers, sometimes before they wear out.

40:26.504 --> 40:32.170
just because there's something better in the market, and we have the disposable income.

40:32.190 --> 40:34.153
And they're going to start tailoring television for us.

40:34.713 --> 40:41.881
If you tune in those golf shows on Saturday afternoons this month, lovely for a nap on the couch.

40:41.901 --> 40:42.742
Absolutely wonderful.

40:42.782 --> 40:43.903
Very relaxing.

40:44.684 --> 40:45.866
Note who's advertising.

40:46.566 --> 40:48.248
Carries them.

40:48.268 --> 40:51.252
Porsche?

40:51.552 --> 40:52.793
BMW, Saab, Cadillac, Lincoln?

40:54.455 --> 40:54.796
Why?

40:55.356 --> 40:56.157
They know who's watching.

40:56.440 --> 41:02.130
Look at the evening news, you know, of hemorrhoids.

41:02.270 --> 41:08.180
Yeah, gas teeth.

41:08.360 --> 41:17.816
It's true, my kids, I watch, I never miss the news, and my younger daughter says, why is it that the news and demographics tell us who watches the news, oh, it's like me.

41:21.021 --> 41:21.863
It's true, isn't it?

41:21.883 --> 41:22.684
It is, of course it is.

41:23.187 --> 41:24.789
You know, farts like the news.

41:24.809 --> 41:27.092
They're going to have to start turning out television for us.

41:27.113 --> 41:29.616
And when they do, I figure somebody's going to need product.

41:30.918 --> 41:33.481
It's not going to be elevated and dignified and great.

41:33.521 --> 41:34.363
Oh, will they pay us for it?

41:34.383 --> 41:37.447
You bet your ass they will.

41:37.467 --> 41:41.773
That's the question that I have.

41:41.793 --> 41:43.796
You bet your ass they will.

41:43.816 --> 41:45.558
God, I hope I live to see it.

41:45.578 --> 41:46.039
Oh, you will.

41:46.947 --> 41:48.168
It's going to have it fairly soon.

41:48.189 --> 41:50.371
HDTV is coming in faster than they predicted.

41:50.391 --> 41:54.276
So I hope I can make enough an HDTV to enable me to buy an HDTV.

41:54.296 --> 41:57.099
If you want to watch it.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.902
You know, I keep saying content is necessary.

41:59.222 --> 42:05.630
They keep giving us this extraordinary machine that has remarkable... Newton Minow is still right.

42:05.650 --> 42:06.891
He's more right than ever.

42:08.033 --> 42:12.398
I find that my ability to absorb print by...

42:12.800 --> 42:16.123
10 o'clock is pretty much exhausted for the day.

42:16.183 --> 42:20.868
I've been either writing or reading all day long at that point, or else I've been radiating at Boston University.

42:20.888 --> 42:22.290
But I don't want to think about it anymore.

42:22.450 --> 42:23.491
I want to be entertained.

42:24.472 --> 42:25.853
And the agent will do that for you.

42:26.114 --> 42:29.017
A change of gravity, a choice of enemies, victories.

42:29.838 --> 42:32.040
The first rank stuff, don't put this in the article, please.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.062
My first rank stuff will not entertain you.

42:34.082 --> 42:35.824
After 10 o'clock, if you feel tight, put it down.

42:36.745 --> 42:38.446
But the agent, you'll finish by 10.

42:38.466 --> 42:39.988
Because it doesn't require much thought.

42:40.829 --> 42:43.493
I want something like that in front of me, with pictures.

42:44.274 --> 42:46.036
And I'll even tolerate advertising.

42:46.376 --> 42:50.582
I want NYPD Blue, and I don't want a goddamn rerun, which is what's on tonight.

42:50.822 --> 42:51.483
I want a new one.

42:51.503 --> 42:52.585
I remember those stories.

42:53.206 --> 42:58.092
And the fact that they can get away with those reruns indicates to you how much attention people actually pay to this guy.

42:58.112 --> 43:00.876
This is in Casablanca they're rerunning.

43:00.896 --> 43:04.761
Or Gone with the Wind.
