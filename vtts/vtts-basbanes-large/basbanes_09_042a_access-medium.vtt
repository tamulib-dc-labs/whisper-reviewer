00:03.473 --> 00:04.915
Talking to Walter Crunk.

00:05.216 --> 00:09.062
Keep this here, if you don't mind.

00:09.082 --> 00:12.368
Your tape recorder might pick up the munching of the lobster sandwich.

00:12.428 --> 00:12.989
That's right.

00:13.109 --> 00:14.512
I'm used to it.

00:15.353 --> 00:17.697
As long as there's no music in the background, that's the end.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.300
That's what usually is the killer.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.764
So what do you miss the most?

00:23.306 --> 00:24.909
I'm sure everybody wonders.

00:25.550 --> 00:29.076
Oh, I miss editing.

00:29.444 --> 00:32.829
I'm not talking about fancy.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.914
I miss being on the desk every day.

00:37.276 --> 00:42.023
I love being a managing editor.

00:42.184 --> 00:57.207
I like taking the news off the press service wires from my correspondence, if you please, and hunching stories, getting people on them, getting them done right.

00:58.199 --> 00:59.762
and editing the copy.

01:00.423 --> 01:05.070
I just like, I like daily journalism.

01:05.090 --> 01:07.995
I don't at all dislike covering it.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.298
I like that a great deal, too.

01:10.319 --> 01:18.832
I would be very unhappy, I think, if I were frozen on a newspaper desk somewhere and never got out on the street at all.

01:19.674 --> 01:25.523
I'd certainly be unhappy, I think, being an anchorman and never getting out an occasional story.

01:26.482 --> 01:35.195
I do have a feeling that anchor people are overused today in their unbreaking story.

01:39.801 --> 01:45.009
I feel that an awful lot of that is showboating.

01:45.029 --> 01:46.992
You call it parachuting the men.

01:47.052 --> 01:48.373
Yeah, the parachuting.

01:48.454 --> 01:49.836
That's a great phrase.

01:49.856 --> 01:50.256
Exactly.

01:50.356 --> 01:51.178
Wow.

01:51.198 --> 01:51.818
Big footing.

01:52.139 --> 01:55.003
I've had my notes too.

01:55.388 --> 01:57.791
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

01:57.811 --> 01:59.995
But that is a comment on what's happening.

02:00.515 --> 02:02.098
And these guys aren't really reporters.

02:02.558 --> 02:04.621
That's the irony of the whole thing, are they?

02:04.801 --> 02:07.405
Well, not the network guys.

02:08.427 --> 02:14.075
Those three fellows are all damn fine reporters.

02:14.235 --> 02:19.923
They did their apprenticeship well.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.847
Brokaw and the

02:23.401 --> 02:36.415
And I think not only good reporters, but I think they are good extemporaneous broadcasters.

02:36.495 --> 02:41.981
Once they've done their reporting, I think they're very good.

02:42.001 --> 02:51.231
But they don't have the opportunity to report like a newspaper person does

02:51.532 --> 02:54.194
really dig deep and then write deep.

02:54.975 --> 03:20.357
That's the main thing that differentiates, I think, broadcasters from press, print journalism, is that the print journalist still is capable of putting together a thousand-word story, or a much longer story, a real breaking story.

03:20.776 --> 03:25.402
That is an extremely difficult task.

03:26.423 --> 03:34.233
It requires an awful lot of organizational skill, keeping a lot of things in mind.

03:34.713 --> 03:49.652
The whole idea is only too well, I'm not telling you, but the idea of knowing how you progress through a story to get all those facts in and play them again.

03:50.037 --> 03:52.080
at the proper point in the story.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.743
And knowing what the lead is.

03:54.983 --> 03:56.045
And knowing what the lead is.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.408
Well, that's what I was just going to say.

03:58.428 --> 04:05.717
Knowing the lead and then the whole inverted pyramid idea, I think it's been lost almost in print.

04:06.478 --> 04:13.927
And it never was there in broadcast journalism.

04:14.368 --> 04:19.234
The skills of a good...

04:19.400 --> 04:26.909
print reporter, accurately, almost instantly when they get into broadcasting.

04:26.929 --> 04:35.780
Happened to me, to a degree, and it's happened to every writer I try to bring from a press service over to my news desk.

04:36.501 --> 04:41.487
I wanted press service people, I wanted a card who were fast and accurate.

04:41.607 --> 04:47.955
I wanted people who weren't going to write particularly fancily, but would get the facts out quickly.

04:48.391 --> 04:57.442
And I wanted people who understood the press service business so they would not assume that every press service story was word from God.

04:58.443 --> 05:02.508
I wanted them to question the press service story when they come in.

05:02.748 --> 05:08.395
Having worked with the press service 11 years, I know that we make mistakes and miss the lead.

05:10.157 --> 05:16.845
And I want people who are going to read all the 38 paragraphs and say, wait a minute, the lead's down there in the 8th paragraph.

05:17.298 --> 05:25.949
We could be two news cycles ahead on the evening news, and were, because of me, mostly.

05:26.149 --> 05:30.414
That's one of the rare areas that I claim dominance.

05:30.434 --> 05:33.938
But I was absolutely terrific at that.

05:36.722 --> 05:38.824
I said, we were not.

05:39.024 --> 05:44.691
Of course, our main wire all day was the day wire.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.212
I said...

05:45.952 --> 05:48.055
We don't write off the day wire.

05:49.516 --> 05:58.107
We don't write even the leads off the night wire, which are just beginning to come in as we have to close our broadcasts.

05:58.127 --> 05:59.829
We don't even write the lead off that.

06:00.830 --> 06:05.455
We have to look through that, and we've got to write the overnight story.

06:06.136 --> 06:09.220
That's the story for the next afternoon, the newspapers.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.082
That's the way it's done our press service.

06:11.602 --> 06:14.065
And there's no reason why we can't do it here in the newsroom.

06:14.085 --> 06:16.167
Now, you're talking about breaking news here, of course.

06:16.187 --> 06:17.108
I'm talking about breaking news.

06:17.128 --> 06:17.468
Oh, sure.

06:17.488 --> 06:26.818
I mean, the features I notice as a devoted reader of the New York Times, I can pretty much predict that the features on the evening news are going to be five days after I read the Times.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.359
Of course you can.

06:28.579 --> 06:29.420
Sure.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.043
And that's the way it is.

06:32.123 --> 06:38.029
I mean, I think they have editors at the networks reading, clipping the Times every morning.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.832
You know, that's the nature of the piece.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.123
You're a deadline, as you indicated.

06:44.143 --> 06:46.006
You're a deadline journalist.

06:46.107 --> 06:47.208
I sensed it.

06:47.228 --> 06:50.794
I read someplace that this book had been under contract, I guess, for about 20 years.

06:50.854 --> 06:52.557
Is that about one?

06:53.819 --> 06:56.183
Yeah.

06:56.263 --> 06:59.748
So what took you so long?

07:01.411 --> 07:02.753
Well...

07:02.935 --> 07:09.822
Do you feel that you have to have a deadline pushing you to get the time?

07:09.842 --> 07:12.105
That's a great deal part of it.

07:12.405 --> 07:14.347
Although I never did have a deadline, really.

07:14.367 --> 07:19.372
At one point I had a deadline for this book that I'd overran in a couple of years.

07:20.093 --> 07:30.664
The story of the contract for this book is one of

07:31.387 --> 07:35.391
of utter disinterest on my part and major sloth.

07:36.653 --> 07:45.422
It occurred, a good friend of mine was a vice president at Knopf.

07:45.442 --> 07:46.002
It happened.

07:47.524 --> 07:51.668
And in fact, he was a family member at Knopf, somehow or other.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.612
Peter Schulte was his name.

07:55.292 --> 07:55.993
Tony Schulte.

07:56.073 --> 07:56.754
Tony Schulte.

07:56.794 --> 07:57.555
Peter was his son.

07:57.875 --> 08:00.718
Tony Schulte.

08:01.154 --> 08:08.722
Tony Schote took my kids with his kids, who were classmates, skiing almost every weekend.

08:08.762 --> 08:14.689
And we met and had family dinner, kind of, when they got back on Sunday evening.

08:15.449 --> 08:18.593
And Tony started nagging me to write a book.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.276
I'm talking, this was in the 60s.

08:22.317 --> 08:25.600
And he started nagging me, I should write a book.

08:26.822 --> 08:28.924
I said, I have no interest in writing a book.

08:28.984 --> 08:29.845
I'm not going to write a book.

08:30.314 --> 08:31.676
Nag, nag, nag.

08:31.716 --> 08:33.899
I mean, every Sunday night again.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.742
And I got pretty sick of it.

08:36.823 --> 08:42.371
We may have had a couple of martinis by that time one evening when I said, Tony, I'll make a deal with you.

08:44.033 --> 08:51.023
I will promise you that Knopf can have my memoirs if I ever write them.

08:51.172 --> 09:01.123
If you can promise me that nobody cannot ever mention this to me again, and I want no advance payment, because I don't want anything hanging out of my head.

09:01.143 --> 09:02.365
You didn't take an advance on that?

09:02.385 --> 09:02.785
No, no.

09:02.805 --> 09:12.316
I said no advance payment, and I promise that you'll have the book, but you've got to promise me that nobody ever mentions this again.

09:12.336 --> 09:13.437
And when was this about?

09:14.038 --> 09:14.899
Oh, about 1960.

09:15.079 --> 09:16.260
Let me see.

09:16.280 --> 09:16.781
60s?

09:16.801 --> 09:17.742
Yeah.

09:18.202 --> 09:18.883
That's it.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.629
Oh, no, everybody's 70.

09:20.829 --> 09:21.530
I'm sorry.

09:21.550 --> 09:22.491
25 years.

09:22.511 --> 09:22.831
72.

09:22.852 --> 09:24.073
25 years.

09:24.093 --> 09:24.834
72, yep.

09:24.854 --> 09:28.238
72.

09:28.358 --> 09:32.243
And nobody, Knopf, ever did.

09:33.485 --> 09:46.741
I must say there was a little bit of an entract there that we made this deal over the dinner table on Sunday night.

09:46.761 --> 09:47.502
It was a handshake.

09:47.522 --> 09:48.583
It was a handshake deal.

09:49.154 --> 09:51.837
I thought, well, I didn't even think about it.

09:51.857 --> 09:56.383
I thought that was a joke, and it was over, and, you know, that was it.

09:57.124 --> 10:03.351
The next day morning, my agent called me, who had never known to have gotten up before 10.30 in the morning.

10:04.132 --> 10:08.217
He called me at 9.30, and I knew it was a major crisis when he called at 9.30.

10:08.237 --> 10:10.300
He said, Walter, Walter, what's this about?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.161
You're writing a book.

10:12.743 --> 10:16.768
And he knew Tony Schulte also, as I did, from his friends.

10:17.549 --> 10:17.929
And, uh,

10:18.432 --> 10:20.276
He said, what's this right around me?

10:20.296 --> 10:21.338
I said, I'm not writing about it.

10:21.358 --> 10:21.819
What do you mean?

10:22.460 --> 10:24.023
He said, Tony, sure, he thinks you are.

10:24.043 --> 10:25.366
He's just been on the phone to me.

10:25.947 --> 10:29.073
And he's got the contract drawn, wants to meet us for lunch.

10:29.594 --> 10:31.719
Naturally, part of his role, he ought to meet you for lunch.

10:32.059 --> 10:33.362
He wants to get it written down.

10:33.683 --> 10:34.464
Yeah.

10:35.266 --> 10:40.356
So he arrived with, we met at lunch, and sure enough, he had a contract.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.556
saying just what I'd specified.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.619
You got it in there that he'd never brought you?

10:45.639 --> 10:48.683
That nobody, Knopf, could ever mention it to me.

10:48.703 --> 10:51.027
They said it just that way, could never mention it.

10:51.047 --> 10:54.812
And I simply found a book, but there was no deadline.

10:54.832 --> 10:59.418
If I ever wrote a book, as the way it was phrased, Knopf could have it, a memoir.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.001
Knopf could have it.

11:02.202 --> 11:06.208
Well, we signed it, and also it was classified.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.386
that the payment from Knopf for this was a dollar and other considerations.

11:11.646 --> 11:13.068
That's a great story.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.972
So we left.

11:17.133 --> 11:17.894
I get a call.

11:17.914 --> 11:21.458
I'm back from lunch.

11:21.478 --> 11:25.824
There's a call from Tony, already my secretary.

11:27.145 --> 11:27.966
Tony has called.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.009
Walter, Walter's friend.

11:30.029 --> 11:33.513
He said, our lawyers turned down the contract.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.115
They said that a dollar...

11:35.483 --> 11:41.110
was not adequate considerations and therefore would never hold up in court.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.331
I said, well, then there's no deal.

11:42.552 --> 11:45.555
I'm not going to have any money hanging over my head to write a book.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.319
And he said, well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

11:48.619 --> 11:49.920
It's only $10,000.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.283
I said, definitely no deal.

11:52.423 --> 11:54.947
$10,000, $10,000.

11:56.268 --> 11:59.112
He said, Walter, look, if you're worried about it.

11:59.132 --> 12:04.478
I said, you know, if I don't write the book, you're going to want $10,000 back someday.

12:04.913 --> 12:08.559
And with interest and all of that, I'm not going to get involved in that.

12:08.579 --> 12:12.024
And he said, Walter, you can put it in escrow.

12:12.044 --> 12:13.627
Well, I'm so dumb financially.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.009
I said, what's escrow?

12:16.050 --> 12:22.841
And he said, you can put it in the bank for a specific purpose, and it doesn't draw interest, but it's always available to be withdrawn.

12:23.482 --> 12:26.186
So I said, well, I'll do that.

12:26.226 --> 12:27.668
That's okay.

12:28.249 --> 12:33.317
So I called up Sticks, and I said, my agent, I said,

12:33.837 --> 12:42.426
I've made a different kind of a deal with Tony sending over the contract.

12:42.466 --> 12:44.148
I'm going to take $10,000.

12:44.268 --> 12:45.889
I said, oh, that's fine.

12:45.909 --> 12:46.570
That's okay.

12:47.291 --> 12:50.674
Obviously, I'm going to get 10% or so of it.

12:50.975 --> 12:55.419
So anyway, he thinks that's fine until I said, I'm putting it in escrow.

12:55.439 --> 12:56.821
Then he said, you can't do that.

12:56.841 --> 12:58.322
It doesn't draw interest.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.664
I said, that's just the point.

12:59.784 --> 13:01.145
It doesn't draw interest.

13:01.185 --> 13:02.967
Well, anyway, we...

13:03.250 --> 13:04.652
That was the contract.

13:06.736 --> 13:16.832
And it lasted for about 18 years or more, with nobody at Knopf ever mentioning it to me again, including Tony Schultz.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.676
Never heard from anybody, no words.

13:20.398 --> 13:24.344
And I was perfectly happy in these circumstances.

13:24.364 --> 13:28.391
But I had a book kind of in my mind, so I'd write little notes to myself.

13:28.931 --> 13:29.933
Occasionally I'd write them.

13:30.723 --> 13:32.645
four or five pages.

13:32.806 --> 13:34.628
Was it this book that you had in your mind?

13:34.728 --> 13:35.329
Yeah.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.912
I mean, someday I might want to put a book together.

13:39.173 --> 13:55.713
And then, about four or five years ago, now, one of the officials at Random House, a friend of mine, called and he said, let's have lunch.

13:56.594 --> 13:57.876
We never had lunch.

13:59.077 --> 14:00.679
I said, Bob,

14:01.958 --> 14:08.003
Before we have lunch, I want you to be sure that you've read that contract very carefully.

14:08.944 --> 14:11.486
And he is kind of a humorous guy, and he said, I read it.

14:11.526 --> 14:14.169
He said, all right, I want to have lunch with you.

14:14.189 --> 14:21.876
So when we went to lunch, we talked about a lot of mutual interest, amnesty, and a lot of boards we serve on kind of together.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.457
He was waiting for you to bring it up.

14:23.637 --> 14:26.440
He was hoping that I would bring it up, I guess.

14:26.460 --> 14:31.324
We finished lunch, got the coffee, and he said, Walter,

14:31.861 --> 14:40.973
would you consider that I have broken the contract, which maybe I already have by bringing this up, if I said just one word?

14:43.196 --> 14:48.203
And I said, I'm so fascinated at what one word you could say that would make any difference.

14:48.644 --> 14:49.024
Say it.

14:49.745 --> 14:51.347
He said, right.

14:53.771 --> 14:55.753
Well, that opened the discussion, obviously.

14:56.474 --> 14:58.677
And at this point, I wrote it.

14:59.038 --> 15:01.581
We did a serious contract with a serious

15:01.983 --> 15:08.690
six-figure advance and a three-year deadline.

15:09.851 --> 15:12.173
And I ran two years over that one.

15:12.193 --> 15:13.775
So this was about 91 then?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.558
Yup.

15:16.578 --> 15:16.658
Yup.

15:18.600 --> 15:31.433
And at that time, I began doing some fairly, I wouldn't call it concentrated writing, but I wrote a chapter eventually.

15:31.919 --> 15:35.464
sent that over to Ash Green, and he didn't think much of it, apparently.

15:35.665 --> 15:36.085
I don't know.

15:37.527 --> 15:40.532
He didn't get terribly enthusiastic.

15:40.752 --> 15:49.605
As a matter of fact, the first two chapters I worked up, we called Ash, we had lunch.

15:49.846 --> 15:51.849
You've got to have lunch with your publisher in New York.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.130
It's the only way you do business.

15:53.711 --> 15:54.533
And we had lunch.

15:55.234 --> 15:58.939
And I had prepared, I'd sent it over to him,

15:59.341 --> 16:01.824
And he called and said, let's have lunch and talk about it.

16:02.926 --> 16:12.139
And I prepared a little note to him, because Ash Green is a wonderful, interesting, intellectual, I like to have lunch with.

16:13.100 --> 16:21.451
And I handed him, as we sat down to lunch, I handed him a sheet of paper that I had written on.

16:21.471 --> 16:28.521
And I said, Ash, rather than our discussion, my two chapters, which might ruin our friendship and the lunch,

16:28.906 --> 16:43.865
I've never had a book before, and I don't know how you perform, but I can see myself being offended over your criticism, and I can see you having a lot of criticism.

16:43.886 --> 16:47.931
I think I'd have it myself about these two drafts, chapters.

16:48.391 --> 16:57.343
So I present you with this note that you can simply, it's a morbid answer question,

16:57.745 --> 17:00.209
You can select one or more of these answers.

17:00.770 --> 17:05.497
The more of them you select, the less sincere I think you really are.

17:05.938 --> 17:07.220
But here they are.

17:07.260 --> 17:12.709
And the thing says, well, I can't remember them all now.

17:12.729 --> 17:13.530
There were five of them.

17:13.550 --> 17:21.423
But one, the first one was, A, was water.

17:22.164 --> 17:24.748
These chapters are very interesting.

17:25.083 --> 17:28.048
We'd like to see a few more before we get to it.

17:28.388 --> 17:29.370
And this is what you drafted.

17:29.390 --> 17:30.271
This is what I drafted.

17:31.513 --> 17:33.937
And B was Walter.

17:34.558 --> 17:41.989
We've got some very good people who have worked with some of our famous authors in the past.

17:42.630 --> 17:47.438
C was Walter.

17:47.458 --> 17:51.664
I think I'd like to see some of your more serious chapters.

17:51.998 --> 18:03.488
D was something, but the final one was, Walter, I don't think you understand how the publishing business has changed since your contract was signed.

18:03.509 --> 18:06.651
Well, so what did he, was his reaction, did he laugh?

18:06.671 --> 18:19.423
His reaction, and I say this, if you report it with a big smile of affection, Ash is a very kind of a doer guy.

18:19.859 --> 18:24.445
Good sense of humor, but not a laughing fellow, fortunately in a way.

18:25.306 --> 18:34.119
He took it, looked at it, folded it, put it in his pocket and said, now about those two chapters.

18:34.940 --> 18:38.024
Did he recommend many changes in that?

18:38.044 --> 18:39.025
No, no.

18:39.045 --> 18:41.629
That was kind of part of the problem.

18:41.669 --> 18:43.251
He didn't get it.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.604
involved in changes.

18:46.144 --> 18:50.288
He simply said, I think that these look very good to me.

18:50.929 --> 18:51.909
I'm not sure he said very.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.291
These look all right to me.

18:53.911 --> 19:09.145
And I would like to actually, he did say, I would like to wait until we get down into some of the later years because I was doing it chronologically from birth.

19:10.186 --> 19:12.208
And he said, I'd kind of like to

19:12.982 --> 19:17.729
I'd like to get to, you know, the professional career before we really get interested.

19:17.749 --> 19:19.592
And I assume you're getting back pretty shortly.

19:21.155 --> 19:24.119
Well, I don't know.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.246
It wasn't so encouraging that I wanted to rush back to the computer.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.170
And so another year passed.

19:31.190 --> 19:31.731
Another year.

19:32.112 --> 19:33.454
I think so.

19:33.974 --> 19:37.279
And really, I didn't get down to it, really didn't get to it seriously.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.922
I just had more things to do.

19:38.982 --> 19:40.845
There were more interest in writing a book.

19:41.186 --> 19:45.613
I didn't get to it until I had a knee operation last January.

19:45.693 --> 19:50.961
So really, January, once you got into it, you apparently put it together rather quickly?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.985
Six months, January to June.

19:53.505 --> 19:55.489
Was it fun once you started going with it?

19:55.509 --> 19:55.829
Oh, great fun.

19:55.849 --> 19:56.931
Or was it a pain in the neck?

19:57.292 --> 19:58.193
Oh, well, it was...

19:58.713 --> 20:06.260
It was fun to write, fun to play with the words, fun to get the thing organized properly.

20:06.320 --> 20:16.949
I think organization was the worst problem I had with it, I think, as other people have with any kind of memoir.

20:17.950 --> 20:23.555
Whether you stay chronological, it's a terrible problem.

20:23.575 --> 20:26.678
I had a lot of... One of the things that made it

20:26.995 --> 20:40.185
As fast as it was, I had some superb research help from one of my dear friends at CBS, who's now retired CBS, Joe Worshba.

20:40.786 --> 20:42.490
And I could toss things to him.

20:42.925 --> 20:46.569
Just things like dates, but quotations and things, you know.

20:47.050 --> 20:49.272
I've got my wife doing money for you.

20:49.292 --> 20:54.538
Yeah, but that is invaluable, as you know, and time saver, that is.

20:54.558 --> 20:57.121
And they have to be so reliable, too.

20:57.141 --> 21:04.029
One thing, the only problem I had with Joe Worshman and his wife, they're both professionals, both producers and writers.

21:04.049 --> 21:07.313
He was a 60 Minutes producer and writer, reporter.

21:08.153 --> 21:32.338
before that but the biggest problem i had with him he writes superbly well and he also is an absolutely insufferably indefatigable researcher i'd ask him for what was the date of the new london texas school disaster well i know that story intimately having been there four days it's my story i don't need any

21:32.808 --> 21:38.793
research on it, he turns out a chapter about the New London, Texas School.

21:39.013 --> 21:40.615
And I don't have time to plow through it.

21:40.835 --> 21:49.002
I mean, this was kind of a standing joke between Joe and his wife and I, because his wife keeps saying, give him a page.

21:49.062 --> 21:50.263
He doesn't need a chapter.

21:50.984 --> 21:56.208
But in that material, there'd be some beautiful lines, really good lines.

21:57.610 --> 22:01.633
I was so tempted to use them, but I was determined.

22:02.069 --> 22:06.816
and determined that not one word of this book would be written by anybody other than me.

22:06.836 --> 22:08.839
That's one of my questions, you know.

22:08.899 --> 22:16.010
What if they had, say, said to you, hey, there's a guy by the name of Novak, you know, who helped Tim, who helped these other guys?

22:16.131 --> 22:23.602
Well, that was never suggested by name, but occasionally people would say, well... That's just for instance.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.306
They would say, why don't you dictate it and we can fill it.

22:26.326 --> 22:28.870
You know, gee, that's an insult.

22:29.339 --> 22:37.128
There are a lot of your colleagues, however, who haven't felt that way, younger colleagues.

22:37.188 --> 22:45.297
Not only that, there are some who publish some books that I think is disgraceful.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.782
It's not disgraceful that they're putting anything over on anybody.

22:50.443 --> 22:56.890
It's disgraceful that they call themselves journalists and feel they can't write their own book.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.992
What the devil, what kind of journalist is that?

22:59.208 --> 23:03.213
That's the quote I've been waiting for.

23:03.233 --> 23:12.184
You know, towards the end of the book, you say, you have a quote, people usually ask, do you hope that you make a difference?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.427
And you say, surprisingly, you can't say that you did.

23:15.968 --> 23:21.495
I wonder, maybe you could... One of the worst pieces of writing in the book is there, and there's some other examples.

23:22.876 --> 23:27.662
But that was a very bad piece, because it did not make clear...

23:28.385 --> 23:50.646
this has come up before obviously i'm not i had living this answer this has come up before people ask me therefore i know that it's misleading what i meant to say was in television journalism not in life uh i

23:50.963 --> 23:54.767
I think I... Because I think so many of us would disagree with that.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.250
That is what I'm trying to say.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.893
Let me reassure you that that's not the case.

24:00.194 --> 24:00.814
Well, thank you.

24:00.834 --> 24:04.138
I appreciate that because everybody would like to think that they could do it.

24:05.119 --> 24:20.397
But I meant, and the only thing that really, I think, a contribution I've had to make, basically, is perhaps in helping to pioneer a form of journalism which has become a whole...

24:20.579 --> 24:25.206
encompassing and dominating, practically.

24:26.007 --> 24:36.763
And I thought that my generation established a foundation, a set of principles and ethics that would live.

24:37.444 --> 24:50.063
And we had built something like, as solid as the publishing business, with good newspapers, and that CBS's and NBC's

24:50.515 --> 25:07.190
ABCs of this world, being the stolid big boys like the New York Times, would perform like the New York Times with responsibility, with understanding of what their place in society was.

25:08.571 --> 25:10.152
And I don't think that's so today.

25:11.173 --> 25:19.881
I think that the pioneers in ownership, the Paley's, Sarnoff,

25:20.283 --> 25:40.593
while not perhaps entirely cognizant of their responsibility, understood it almost subconsciously because they were forced to.

25:40.914 --> 25:49.767
They went through the early days of the regulation of broadcasting, and they had to sit in for hearing after hearing,

25:50.287 --> 25:57.095
FCC meeting after FCC meeting on what the responsibility of broadcasters is.

25:58.236 --> 26:06.806
Now, the FCC has now, of course, totally abandoned any suggestion that it would regulate responsibility of broadcasters.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.469
But in those days, they were very serious about it.

26:10.490 --> 26:16.337
As you know, for many, many years, radio couldn't editorialize, for instance.

26:16.758 --> 26:17.138
And...

26:17.388 --> 26:28.680
And for a station license, you have to show, as you still do today, for that matter, fairness in the community, although not enforced very much anymore.

26:29.762 --> 26:35.188
So those guys learned that there was a responsibility in the business.

26:36.089 --> 26:47.361
The present people aren't broadcasters, never thought of being broadcasters until it turned out to be a profit center.

26:47.628 --> 26:50.070
I'm not talking here.

26:50.210 --> 26:50.911
Let me be clear.

26:51.412 --> 26:53.293
I'm not talking about the journalists.

26:54.114 --> 27:01.001
But there has been perceived to be a decline in the quality of the news sites at all of the networks.

27:01.481 --> 27:02.703
Maybe you disagree with that.

27:04.144 --> 27:12.492
I certainly think that most of us are news aficionados feel that the news is not really as good as it was.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.594
Plus this tabloid stuff.

27:14.934 --> 27:15.375
The what?

27:15.655 --> 27:16.656
The tabloid...

27:16.838 --> 27:22.644
journalism that we see on television now and the networks kind of being drawn into that to a degree.

27:22.664 --> 27:43.164
Well, of course, the networks are seriously culpable of the fact that all three of them, at least, I think all three of them, CBS does, the others do, they let their O and O's, they let their O and O's put the tabloid stuff in where the news ought to be.

27:43.184 --> 27:44.365
Now, what's an O and O?

27:44.598 --> 27:47.422
owned and operating stations.

27:47.923 --> 27:52.971
They can't control what the other stations do, but they control it in a way.

27:53.011 --> 28:00.603
They could not feed them anything until 7 o'clock at night, you know, at prime time.

28:01.324 --> 28:12.681
As it is, they let their evening news programs go at fringe time, and then these

28:13.167 --> 28:16.550
they put in these tabloid shows at prime time.

28:16.810 --> 28:24.217
The audience is much bigger at 7 and 7.30 than it is at 6.30, if anybody knows that.

28:24.698 --> 28:42.634
Now, that's not, however, you can't let that statement follow immediately after my previous statement regarding the dedication of the pioneers, because they agreed to that 6.30 time slot, too.

28:43.475 --> 28:55.632
I wonder, are there any... When we think of all those of us who grew up with Walter Cronkite, you've just been identified with all the major stories of our times.

28:57.154 --> 29:08.710
And I wouldn't ask you to pick any favorites, but I wonder, are there any stories that you didn't cover that you wished... Oh, every one that I didn't cover.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.794
Even recent ones, but of course you don't seem to have that much...

29:12.196 --> 29:24.951
anxiety about having missed the recent political conventions, however, based on your feelings of what's become of the political... Well, I've had anxiety about missing them.

29:25.072 --> 29:30.278
I hate to miss them, but I don't have any alibi for my work.

29:31.279 --> 29:35.825
I've permitted myself to live under an exclusive contract with CBS all these years.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.330
And instead of

29:40.816 --> 29:43.779
break in and going elsewhere, because I had a kind of loyalty.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.763
But they haven't assigned me to these things, so what else am I going to do?

29:47.984 --> 29:48.884
I'm not going to go out there.

29:49.946 --> 29:56.252
I could go into a newspaper column or something, I suppose, but I don't know.

29:56.312 --> 29:58.094
I'm talking in terms of the conventions.

29:59.716 --> 30:08.765
You're quite open about your evaluation of what's happened with the process to nominate national candidates.

30:08.885 --> 30:10.367
You use some pretty strong language.

30:10.465 --> 30:13.769
in the book, which is uncharacteristic.

30:13.869 --> 30:19.375
You're very kind to most people, except, you know, one gentleman's Van Souter, I guess.

30:20.076 --> 30:21.518
Yeah.

30:21.818 --> 30:29.787
He's my, to me, the bed noir of present-day television journalism.

30:29.807 --> 30:38.177
And I think you express... I must say, his success has been very art-warming to me.

30:38.393 --> 30:43.642
He now runs the public broadcasting station in Sacramento.

30:46.247 --> 30:50.013
It's like the state trooper being sent out to the North Adams Paralympics, I guess.

30:50.334 --> 31:02.916
Would you say that a defining moment in your career was when you, especially a person who was trained in the news services as an objective reporter, making this work?

31:03.115 --> 31:07.980
a political, a state, a taking a stand in the Vietnam War.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.963
Was that a defining moment in your career as a broadcaster?

31:15.366 --> 31:19.811
Defining, I think maybe too strong.

31:19.851 --> 31:26.257
It was certainly, it was unique rather than defining.

31:26.337 --> 31:30.861
We didn't pursue that as an idea that I should do editorials.

31:31.820 --> 31:34.043
and I don't think we should have.

31:34.564 --> 31:57.254
It was certainly a major and dramatic departure from what we'd always done, what I'd always done, and what we'd done television generally, after people didn't step out of their role in those days and do editorial comment.

31:59.076 --> 31:59.717
I only...

32:00.085 --> 32:11.881
I only violated the rule, and whenever I did, and that was three or four times, it was always clearly labeled as such.

32:12.602 --> 32:21.895
It always followed a commercial break so that we could say beforehand, when I come back, I shall have some personal opinion on this.

32:22.536 --> 32:28.945
And then when we came back from the commercial break, this is my personal opinion on this.

32:29.498 --> 32:48.541
And the only other times other than Vietnam were twice on what I would call freedom of press issues, where I had a personal philosophy that, damn it, if we didn't defend freedom of press, who was going to?

32:48.561 --> 32:50.984
So we had to speak out in those cases.

32:51.164 --> 32:58.493
And of course, when your decision to cover the Watergate story the way that you did made a local story

32:59.182 --> 33:28.902
an international story because really the Washington papers Congress is their city hall basically it's a city hall story and really that's what happened to a great extent when you all of a sudden said look at these two guys are doing covering down there and that was a pretty interesting dynamic journalism work I would think we did the story I'm almost proudest of I'm very proud of Watergate

33:29.962 --> 33:35.988
I'm proud that we did Vietnam.

33:36.108 --> 33:43.856
The only problem I had with that one was that the instigation of that was somewhat egotistical.

33:44.837 --> 33:59.192
I mean, the idea that because we had a fairly loyal audience, or at least an audience that believed that CBS was impartial, and...

33:59.678 --> 34:09.510
and unbiased, unprejudiced, and therefore they might want to listen to my view of what this complicated thing was about.

34:09.950 --> 34:13.895
That was egotistical.

34:15.016 --> 34:29.213
But Watergate was not tinged with that, nor was the story of a different nature, which was the serendipity of the Sadat Begin,

34:29.345 --> 34:34.352
And that was purely serendipitous.

34:34.453 --> 34:41.383
I was not, as some of my critics would like to have it, they didn't understand what was happening.

34:41.964 --> 34:43.846
I was not playing diplomat.

34:44.587 --> 34:47.732
I was not raising trial balloons or anything of that kind.

34:48.153 --> 34:50.116
I was trying to knock down the story.

34:51.077 --> 34:57.867
And it just happened because I used some good journalistic enterprise in pinning him down

34:58.505 --> 35:05.153
But when I was startled to find he meant he liked to go, then I didn't let it go at that.

35:05.173 --> 35:06.534
I pinned him down when he could go.

35:07.335 --> 35:15.985
And it turned out that that accelerated the process, which might have happened anyway, but also might have stalled for months or years.

35:17.046 --> 35:18.688
And I was very proud of that one.

35:18.708 --> 35:19.709
Any regrets?

35:19.870 --> 35:23.053
Any stories that you feel that you could have handled differently and better?

35:24.315 --> 35:26.117
Oh, almost daily.

35:27.298 --> 35:28.039
Almost daily.

35:28.947 --> 35:38.497
One of the worst was the one that I go to my grave regretting was a story about Ham Jordan.

35:38.517 --> 35:40.940
I remember Carter's assistant.

35:42.021 --> 35:51.491
And Ham had been kind of a, I don't know, scapegoated.

35:51.631 --> 35:52.813
Well, that's not it either.

35:53.794 --> 35:56.777
He'd been the focus of a

35:57.314 --> 36:03.122
A lot of kind of critical, snide, column-type items in Washington.

36:03.643 --> 36:11.073
You remember there was an incident at a bar where he turned over a drink on a lady or something of the kind.

36:11.114 --> 36:17.983
And then there were some suggestions that there were some narcotics involved.

36:18.724 --> 36:26.275
One time, another, well, Mike Wallace came back from the West Coast with a story he had uncovered.

36:26.963 --> 36:45.325
out there that Pam Jordan, according to his story, this alleged story, that Pam Jordan had been involved in helping supply the coke of the Hollywood party.

36:45.485 --> 36:54.135
And Mike said they weren't going to use it for 60 minutes and that we want it for evening news.

36:55.027 --> 37:07.978
Well, yeah, I wanted a story for the evening news, and we got Mike to help us pursue it, and we came up with a fairly substantial story.

37:09.320 --> 37:19.669
No proof, but enough substantial to make a substantial story.

37:19.689 --> 37:20.289
To go with it.

37:20.470 --> 37:21.851
To go with it.

37:21.871 --> 37:23.312
But, but,

37:24.946 --> 37:32.076
I then yielded to the suggestion of our producer at the time that we lead with it.

37:35.180 --> 37:36.983
An awful, awful mistake.

37:37.984 --> 37:41.029
It put an emphasis on the story which it did not deserve.

37:41.049 --> 37:44.553
It put a credibility on the story it did not deserve.

37:45.735 --> 37:48.659
And did Amjurton a great injustice.

37:48.819 --> 37:54.227
I would say something that Amjurton never called me about.

37:54.916 --> 37:57.799
I didn't hear from anybody at the White House about it.

37:58.940 --> 38:00.762
That was worse.

38:01.583 --> 38:07.610
If they'd called and screamed and hollered, I could have screamed and hollered back.

38:08.050 --> 38:12.475
But as I was, I felt that they had simply said, well, we write him off.

38:12.775 --> 38:16.559
I know you've got another interview coming up.

38:16.579 --> 38:17.300
Oh, yes.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.121
Oh, God, we do.

38:18.381 --> 38:23.927
Could you inscribe a couple of books for me quickly, if you have a chance, one for me?

38:24.616 --> 38:26.199
If you don't mind.

38:28.502 --> 38:42.645
I'm not very good at old fashioned.

38:42.825 --> 38:45.409
I'm Nick.

38:45.912 --> 38:47.317
M-I-C-K?

38:47.618 --> 38:56.209
N. N. N.
