00:02.444 --> 00:24.621
The only thing that I noticed in my 20 years now was that Ludwig Bieler's book, which was published in German press, called Ireland Harbinger of the Middle Ages.

00:25.850 --> 00:34.761
which is really one of the great books on the transmission through the Irish missionaries and what have you, wasn't sighted by him at all.

00:35.882 --> 00:37.264
Strange, you know.

00:38.926 --> 00:50.119
I know him not well, but I interviewed him for that book, and he actually wrote a very nice blurb for my book, and I wrote a keynote.

00:50.656 --> 00:52.179
I enjoyed it.

00:52.199 --> 00:53.461
I wrote my piece on that for St.

00:53.541 --> 00:57.489
Patrick's Day.

00:57.930 --> 01:08.530
Anyway, I thought this book was in the same line as Gracious or whatever it was.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.133
I was not going to...

01:11.041 --> 01:14.346
He saw in my eyes, by the way.

01:15.448 --> 01:20.555
But by golly, I read it with great joy and admiration for his.

01:21.537 --> 01:26.003
Then I read his biography.

01:26.785 --> 01:29.649
And sure, he has a good trait.

01:29.669 --> 01:39.023
But I wonder, you know, if we didn't have the world of Benedict or if we didn't have these Irish missions.

01:40.403 --> 01:43.566
Do you think that it would be lost?

01:44.768 --> 01:49.913
A great deal would be lost.

01:49.933 --> 01:52.997
Not necessarily everything.

01:53.137 --> 02:01.606
You take the cathedral library at Verona.

02:01.626 --> 02:04.829
They'll take you to that cathedral library.

02:04.849 --> 02:05.490
It was a day or two days ago.

02:05.850 --> 02:06.611
How were you?

02:06.631 --> 02:08.233
Yes, two or three days ago.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.122
Take a picture of that?

02:10.142 --> 02:10.462
Sure.

02:11.263 --> 02:16.188
Until the fact that nobody ever used these.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.971
They never even thought of using it.

02:19.111 --> 02:19.932
Nobody told us that.

02:20.293 --> 02:25.999
The stuff lay there untouched.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.644
Nobody was interested.

02:30.664 --> 02:35.089
So it didn't get that until the little ages.

02:35.109 --> 02:38.372
And so you've got these papalites which are sort of

02:38.791 --> 02:42.216
Yeah, I suppose, live mausolea.

02:44.099 --> 03:07.752
Where the stuff, not like Monte Cassino, where the monks were gathering and using, but then Monte Cassino from, I would say 1200, at the time Thomas De Quince was there as a boy, a student, I doubt many of them were doing much about all this stuff.

03:10.060 --> 03:38.008
I think that there are places like some of the cathedral churches in Spain, independent entirely of monastic settings, where you had a learned clergy for a while, and then you had, not necessarily an illiterate clergy, but a clergy with other Catholic religions.

03:38.292 --> 03:44.281
who were literate enough not to throw out the stuff.

03:44.301 --> 03:47.325
You see, that's the problem with our modern libraries.

03:47.345 --> 03:52.893
You see, librarians think they know everything else.

03:53.273 --> 04:03.428
And so, because this isn't of interest to them, therefore it's of no interest to anybody, therefore we don't.

04:03.448 --> 04:06.172
Because libraries are left but we have other individuals before.

04:06.873 --> 04:07.894
Because Confucius said that.

04:09.494 --> 04:16.682
That was ringing.

04:16.722 --> 04:17.202
It stopped.

04:21.607 --> 04:26.052
We won't take up too much more of your time, Father.

04:26.072 --> 04:32.739
You've been very generous.

04:32.759 --> 04:33.720
You know, did you notice?

04:35.422 --> 04:36.563
I'm sorry.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.185
You pressed the button.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.161
and then it flowed out.

04:43.745 --> 04:55.957
Oh, sorry, to get back to the Aquinas.

04:55.977 --> 05:05.886
There are, at present, I think it's 15 people all together working on the critical edition.

05:05.906 --> 05:06.687
My job

05:07.493 --> 05:18.588
is to be nice to them, encourage them, look at their work, but not do anything myself.

05:18.608 --> 05:21.232
Except to look good.

05:21.933 --> 05:32.308
Because this is highly specialized and highly humbling work.

05:32.328 --> 05:36.994
Because, you know, you've got to go through

05:37.632 --> 05:40.217
Hundreds of manuscripts.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.986
Note the variants in all of them.

05:45.006 --> 05:51.237
And for everyone that is actually doing the editing, six may be to existence.

05:51.257 --> 05:52.099
And what do you see?

05:52.119 --> 05:56.046
A volume like that at the end in your name isn't even mentioned yet.

05:57.646 --> 06:04.473
That's the electrician.

06:05.454 --> 06:11.962
I've been yapping for a few days about the fact that I haven't got a ladder to get up.

06:11.982 --> 06:14.284
My light is as high up as that.

06:15.425 --> 06:17.347
I've got three flongs.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.849
One is working.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.612
So I've got a table ladder.

06:22.452 --> 06:27.597
But that is consistent with the tradition through history of the monks working with the copyists in the scriptoria.

06:29.018 --> 06:33.122
They very rarely got their names into... Very rarely.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.924
Great pity.

06:34.944 --> 06:42.992
It would be nice to know who the illuminators or the rubrications were, and they were made of names, perhaps, or who the copyists were.

06:44.834 --> 06:48.477
Lady from Israel, Aliza Kroen.

06:49.081 --> 07:15.409
who worked for many years and we have all, most of the manuscripts there from the suppressed monastery in the monastery.

07:22.105 --> 07:30.977
And she, all the manuscripts ended up in the Vatican Library.

07:30.997 --> 07:37.205
And this is a monastery that, from a monastery that nobody really had much hair done.

07:38.847 --> 07:44.734
And she stumbled on it and somewhere or another found this cache in the Vatican Library.

07:45.435 --> 07:51.403
She used to sit there with, in front of her.

07:53.054 --> 07:56.658
She was only dealing with the 12th century, I think.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.282
So she didn't look at any other manuscripts.

08:00.302 --> 08:04.847
She looked at them, but she didn't study them.

08:04.868 --> 08:13.998
She identified 25 scribes with A, B, C, D, E. There was one lucky bloke.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.742
His name was John.

08:17.762 --> 08:22.808
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, John.

08:23.075 --> 08:31.484
And she was able to track these out when they began as apprentices.

08:31.504 --> 08:32.285
This is fascinating.

08:32.305 --> 08:36.389
When they moved on to something better.

08:36.409 --> 08:38.551
When they were finally allowed to work.

08:39.012 --> 08:40.433
Did they put this in the books?

08:40.613 --> 08:41.354
Not at all.

08:41.454 --> 08:42.555
She worked it all out.

08:44.578 --> 08:45.659
She lived with it.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.344
This is the 12th century that she reconstructed.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.626
She lived with it.

08:53.146 --> 09:01.816
when they graduated to hire things to really do a Bible or something instead of doing kitchen accounts.

09:03.758 --> 09:06.201
And I think it was 25.

09:08.824 --> 09:15.152
And she'd say, don't ever quote this because it would sound as though she would not.

09:16.013 --> 09:20.478
She would say, that's my bee.

09:20.498 --> 09:22.360
Did she publish a book on this problem?

09:22.947 --> 09:24.589
And her name is Cohen?

09:24.729 --> 09:27.272
Aliza Cohen.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.136
A-L-I-Z-A.

09:30.156 --> 09:30.657
Z to you.

09:31.898 --> 09:36.684
I'll check that out.

09:38.687 --> 09:46.517
I think it's called the Monastery of Frankenthal.

09:47.118 --> 09:50.642
F-R-A-N-C-H-A-L.

09:51.314 --> 09:55.539
And it was basically a forgotten monastery, shall we say.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.060
Absolutely.

09:57.983 --> 09:59.905
And defunct, obviously, no more.

09:59.925 --> 10:04.131
The whole Lord has been defunct since about 1515.

10:04.431 --> 10:09.678
So how did it happen that the documents were saved from there?

10:09.918 --> 10:13.563
No, you shouldn't be asking questions like that.

10:13.583 --> 10:20.612
You see, the Protestant elector, the elector of the Palatinate,

10:22.027 --> 10:28.835
That area, which is Heidelberg and all that area there.

10:28.855 --> 10:34.002
He saw the light and became a Protestant in 1550.

10:36.985 --> 10:40.389
And he was a lover of books.

10:42.031 --> 10:47.638
So he suppressed some monasteries in his jurisdiction.

10:47.658 --> 10:48.439
This is an amazing story.

10:48.459 --> 10:49.941
And took their books.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.931
into the great library which became the Palatine Library.

10:55.973 --> 10:57.035
Oh, great library.

10:57.496 --> 11:01.623
Which was in the Church of the Holy Spirit at Heidelberg.

11:01.643 --> 11:03.907
All around, like that.

11:03.927 --> 11:08.655
Imagine the packets, all bookshelves up there.

11:08.675 --> 11:15.287
And then Maximilian of that area,

11:16.162 --> 11:20.969
decided he would liberate this area from such Protestant intruders.

11:23.292 --> 11:31.204
And he got assistance from the Pope about 1620.

11:31.224 --> 11:41.619
Money for his armies, unconditionally that the library was spared.

11:41.639 --> 11:42.540
That's a wonderful story.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.347
That is how Palatine Library is in the Vatican Library today.

11:50.367 --> 11:51.548
Spoils of war.

11:55.374 --> 12:00.321
It's wonderful.

12:00.341 --> 12:00.881
Oh, boy.

12:01.502 --> 12:02.724
It's so great.

12:02.744 --> 12:04.346
Well, of course, it is.

12:04.927 --> 12:13.759
But there was a big exhibition in 1980, about two years after I arrived.

12:15.410 --> 12:24.844
big exhibition for the four hundred years.

12:27.548 --> 12:34.759
Four hundred years of the University of Idaho.

12:34.779 --> 12:37.923
Six hundred years.

12:38.504 --> 12:39.325
That's six hundred.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.367
That's it.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.190
Thirteen eighty-six.

12:42.831 --> 12:43.071
That's it.

12:45.262 --> 12:50.248
And we sent, I think it was something around two hundred manuscripts.

12:50.268 --> 12:57.417
Two hundred.

12:57.497 --> 13:13.176
You can fall on the bed.

13:17.510 --> 13:21.174
Glorious collection of printed books.

13:21.194 --> 13:23.156
All with Heidelberg bindings.

13:24.237 --> 13:30.143
Most of them printed in Heidelberg, and then bound in Heidelberg, all of them.

13:31.124 --> 13:35.608
Lovely, lovely bindings.

13:35.628 --> 13:42.836
And, I mean, even though there are texts which are to be found everywhere, more or less.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.277
Patristic texts and so on.

13:46.602 --> 13:51.608
being bound and had been printed in Heidelberg and bound in Heidelberg, they had got a special quality.

13:52.409 --> 13:53.750
So we sent those too.

13:55.932 --> 14:02.099
And while they were there, there were little jokes from time to time.

14:02.119 --> 14:03.621
We're gonna keep them.

14:04.983 --> 14:05.423
Not just little jokes.

14:07.165 --> 14:13.352
And because it was 8,000 manuscripts I meant to, all together.

14:15.779 --> 14:43.103
So, the librarian at Heidelberg, who, curiously, for a good Protestant university is a Catholic, the librarian at Heidelberg said to me one day, now, we Catholics don't make much of this, but the plain fact is if they had remained here,

14:44.720 --> 14:46.483
they would have been destroyed by the French.

14:47.724 --> 14:52.351
The French took Heidelberg in 16, these arrived in Nevada in 1623.

14:52.411 --> 15:10.098
The French took Heidelberg, I think it's 1696, something like that, and burned the whole city, including the Church of the Holy Spirit, where that library was, excepting the books were no longer there.

15:10.539 --> 15:11.520
So we saved.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.146
There's no question about it as a matter of fact.

15:15.166 --> 15:22.293
Well, then he said, now don't get too cocky about this, because he said, the French troops were Irish.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.496
I'm talking about mercenaries.

15:26.337 --> 15:29.240
These were the mercenaries.

15:29.260 --> 15:32.724
Oh, that's wonderful.

15:32.744 --> 15:33.365
Very funny.

15:33.805 --> 15:35.907
Can I cover just about everything?

15:35.927 --> 15:37.108
You covered too much.

15:37.129 --> 15:41.473
I would like to know what other projects you have in mind for yourself.

15:41.892 --> 15:54.069
Ah, look, I did a number of, I had left a number of things hanging in 1984, including the addition of that thing of Thomas from the Oxford.

15:55.411 --> 15:59.277
And that is about the first thing I want to finish.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.362
I'll be quite happy, it's the only thing I can finish.

16:04.484 --> 16:06.567
But I'm writing a number of articles.

16:08.757 --> 16:11.680
In my nightlife style they move all over the place.

16:13.061 --> 16:26.594
But I have a number of articles, stuff lying in folders there that I never got around to write, including the early history of this edition of Thomas.

16:27.876 --> 16:34.562
Well, you probably never will, because I'm going to issue it posthumously.

16:39.048 --> 16:55.629
The point is this, that in the Vatican Library, I discovered a cache of documents, all about how this started, which the people professionally in it didn't know about.

16:55.649 --> 17:04.060
So, I mean, I did write three quarters of a long article on it, all the negotiations, and so on, all over Europe.

17:04.861 --> 17:07.705
And the various libraries in the 1880s,

17:07.921 --> 17:15.808
who sent their volumes to Rome, their manuscripts to Rome, for the Dominicans to work on, care of the Vatican Library.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.532
And it's an untold story.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.554
You've got my attention.

17:23.775 --> 17:30.081
And that is one, please God, I want to keep working on.

17:30.201 --> 17:34.946
I don't know where the notes are, unfortunately, probably on the paper.

17:35.566 --> 17:37.708
I haven't sorted out all my stuff yet.

17:37.925 --> 17:41.629
since I moved over in June.

17:41.649 --> 17:45.373
But that's quite a fascinating story.

17:45.393 --> 17:52.240
How do you explain all of this international enthusiasm for this project?

17:52.480 --> 17:55.583
That, in the 1880s, you know.

17:55.603 --> 18:00.749
I think the first sort of exchange of letters was 1879.

18:00.769 --> 18:04.793
The only ones who didn't cooperate, but we don't say this publicly, were the Italians.

18:06.562 --> 18:10.507
Now you see, it was in 1870, was the Resurgency.

18:13.450 --> 18:17.816
And they weren't having any trouble with the Vatican or the church or anything like that.

18:19.658 --> 18:21.941
And so they didn't lend any.

18:23.483 --> 18:26.867
Well, have they subsequently?

18:26.887 --> 18:28.989
Oh, yes.

18:29.009 --> 18:31.973
Do you mind, Father, if I take a photograph or two of you?

18:33.234 --> 18:35.337
We'd love to have a picture of you.

18:36.481 --> 18:49.235
Isn't that interesting?

18:49.255 --> 18:53.039
I thought I'd seen small ones, but I hadn't seen one of them.

18:53.079 --> 18:54.881
I just got this in New York.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.226
And plus, it reverses itself automatically.

18:59.246 --> 19:02.069
It records in both directions.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.632
That's unusual.

19:04.915 --> 19:09.843
It'll automatically go in the other direction.

19:09.863 --> 19:11.145
Is Olympus Japanese?

19:12.487 --> 19:14.290
They're all Japanese.

19:14.310 --> 19:14.570
Oh, are they?

19:14.590 --> 19:14.910
Are they?

19:16.032 --> 19:24.485
Because it really is remote, reverse, off speed, and you get two speeds.

19:24.505 --> 19:24.766
That's right.

19:24.786 --> 19:25.447
I do the slow speed.

19:25.467 --> 19:32.037
And you can even have, which is Japan, Japan, as though you didn't know where Japan was.

19:35.088 --> 19:36.890
They're the optical people.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.513
That's what puzzles me.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.474
These are cameras.

19:39.534 --> 19:42.037
And they're very... I've tried the Sonys.

19:42.638 --> 19:44.541
These Olympuses are the best.

19:44.581 --> 19:47.164
And I'm very hard on them, I have to say.

19:47.184 --> 19:53.092
What's your sort of length of tape, normal tape, if you're doing it at the speed that you did it now?

19:53.112 --> 19:55.936
At the fast speed, it's one hour per size.

19:55.956 --> 19:58.239
At the fast speed, it's 30 minutes per second.

19:58.259 --> 19:59.981
Yes, I know the fast speed.

20:00.001 --> 20:04.487
So this tape... ...a special wall that was built...

20:05.311 --> 20:10.798
The side wall is resting on the line of columns, you see?

20:12.120 --> 20:17.326
So now when you go down, you're going to go right underneath the choir there and all the rest.

20:17.827 --> 20:25.116
What did you say, that wall was a continuation of the wall from the room coming home.

20:25.136 --> 20:25.637
I think even too long.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.681
Oh, that's by the way, that's Cosmotech's payment.

20:29.222 --> 20:34.288
That's the Cosmati family done around the

20:34.488 --> 20:34.868
1220.

20:34.949 --> 20:38.173
That's incredible.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.574
The building here is 1100.

20:40.415 --> 20:42.478
That floor is about 1220.

20:43.839 --> 20:45.502
And look at this, look at this.

20:46.343 --> 20:49.466
Ah yes, I know, the Stainted Roman marches.

20:51.489 --> 20:54.893
There's so much here, you can't turn without nothing.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.111
They were out in the garden.

21:04.131 --> 21:06.995
This is where they were exited.

21:07.015 --> 21:10.760
And they went up underneath the postcard.

21:11.542 --> 21:12.763
Outside that window.

21:13.805 --> 21:20.054
And in 21st they found another passageway leading to the 6th century down.

21:20.074 --> 21:21.476
Which is still not finished.

21:21.536 --> 21:26.584
The same on this side.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.246
All that work is still going on.

21:28.346 --> 21:28.727
You see.

21:29.534 --> 21:34.923
They're supporting them, they're still being supported by states.

21:34.943 --> 21:47.164
So now, you take this to go through and get an idea that I'm keeping an eye on the time, it's going to pass now.

21:49.128 --> 21:51.151
Father, I can't take you now.

21:51.171 --> 21:51.351
Amen.

21:52.133 --> 21:55.238
Thank you.
