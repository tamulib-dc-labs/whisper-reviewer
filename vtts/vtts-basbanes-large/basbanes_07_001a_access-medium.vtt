WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:03.793
You want me to stop, by the way?

00:04.394 --> 00:07.957
Just, uh, I was deciding you to want me to record.

00:07.977 --> 00:10.159
Just let me know.

00:12.241 --> 00:16.325
I guess I'd like to know when you started collecting anything.

00:16.345 --> 00:18.947
I mean, you're obsessed here.

00:18.967 --> 00:20.068
Clearly, I would say you're obsessed.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.050
Well, it's very interesting, you know.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.492
I started collecting when I got married.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.674
Prior to that.

00:26.734 --> 00:27.375
When was that?

00:27.535 --> 00:30.197
That was 27 years ago.

00:31.378 --> 00:31.598
Okay.

00:31.618 --> 00:32.299
And, uh...

00:34.827 --> 00:43.678
I never thought about acquiring anything until that point in time.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.423
I never thought about collecting anything until that time.

00:48.084 --> 00:50.627
I always trap a light, as most single people do.

00:52.129 --> 00:53.711
My wife was a pack rat.

00:54.152 --> 00:59.839
Leonard Besson says the same thing about his wife.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.702
They collect it as a couple, by the way.

01:01.722 --> 01:02.843
That's wonderful.

01:03.262 --> 01:05.984
And we've been doing the same thing for 27 years.

01:06.645 --> 01:09.067
When I first married her, I mean, she saved everything.

01:10.889 --> 01:20.237
And when we decided we were going on our honeymoon, she opted for Williamsburg, which is the renovation, the restoration.

01:21.078 --> 01:23.040
And we went there.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.063
And I never thought about antiques.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.687
And I caught the disease from her.

01:30.707 --> 01:32.188
It is a disease.

01:32.455 --> 01:55.539
Although I was always interested in art because I do remember that our first date, she lived in Florida but came to New York to open a showroom for an importer who she worked for and who she ran the showroom in Florida and he was opening the showroom here in New York and she was opening it for him and setting it up.

01:56.140 --> 01:59.323
Remember our first date, I took it for lunch at the Metropolitan Museum.

02:00.181 --> 02:06.307
We had always been interested in art, but never thought of these things to own.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.749
This is in the early 60s?

02:08.769 --> 02:10.250
This is in the early 60s, exactly.

02:10.270 --> 02:15.935
We were married in 63.

02:15.955 --> 02:16.796
Thank you.

02:16.816 --> 02:18.157
Yes, please.

02:20.400 --> 02:29.648
And what happened was the... Well, we started going, taking a vacation,

02:30.353 --> 02:32.335
We'd visit galleries.

02:33.336 --> 02:35.738
On our honeymoon, we visited antique shops and galleries.

02:35.798 --> 02:38.820
And I started to purchase a few antique objects.

02:39.521 --> 02:45.927
I remember the first painting that I purchased, I paid that painting off at $50 a month.

02:47.908 --> 02:50.330
And I thought that was a lot of money.

02:51.712 --> 02:59.078
And I remember my wife bringing home her first belter chair.

02:59.918 --> 03:29.132
chair in a little upholstery shop in our town in our village and she promised the fellow that she'd pay him ten dollars a week for the chair and i started looking at this chair and i said my god it's fabulous and that of course was was later on because actually what really happened now that i remember when she brought the chair home at that moment when i saw it i said well

03:29.450 --> 03:32.053
If you want to live with used furniture, that's okay with me.

03:33.794 --> 03:35.976
You know, I've come a long way since then.

03:36.156 --> 03:53.814
But after a while, the chair started to grow on me, and then I started this chair, and then I started reading antique publications, and I saw the belt of furniture, pictures of some belt of furniture going off at some country auctions, which was the kind of stuff you never saw in the big cities.

03:55.275 --> 03:58.478
And I started falling in love with the form,

03:59.453 --> 04:00.815
and the design and the motifs.

04:01.456 --> 04:06.041
And I got hooked on Belter Furniture, and I said one day I'd love to have a house full of this stuff.

04:07.443 --> 04:12.770
And we started hunting for furniture, and we were buying paintings, and we were buying antique objects.

04:14.432 --> 04:20.560
Pardon me for interrupting, but had you already begun this business at this point?

04:20.941 --> 04:25.967
Yeah, I had started Mediators in 1966.

04:26.875 --> 04:34.808
But I'd been in business for myself prior to Mediators in a smaller version of this, so that I was always in business for myself.

04:40.377 --> 04:53.558
The collecting started to really heat up when I got interested in the auction process, and that seemed to substitute my gambling instinct.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.114
Do you like to gamble?

04:56.134 --> 04:56.555
I used to.

04:56.575 --> 05:00.358
I used to love to gamble, but when I started to get involved... Table games?

05:00.378 --> 05:01.659
Table games.

05:01.679 --> 05:02.360
Las Vegas.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.342
Yeah, Las Vegas, yeah.

05:06.123 --> 05:10.246
And now... Interesting.

05:10.286 --> 05:11.407
Yeah, and I stopped.

05:11.748 --> 05:23.798
I had totally no desire to gamble once I got involved in buying art objects and paintings, art objects and antiques and furniture and stuff like that.

05:24.655 --> 05:26.318
A lot of what we bought was at auction.

05:26.899 --> 05:29.963
And that was a tremendous kick.

05:29.983 --> 05:30.845
I still do to this day.

05:31.045 --> 05:34.591
I mean, it's like going... Tension, anxiety.

05:35.011 --> 05:37.716
My heart starts to pound into something I want.

05:38.357 --> 05:38.978
I love it.

05:39.038 --> 05:44.907
It's just the most... It's the most phenomenal... It's a sport.

05:45.027 --> 05:45.868
It's a true sport.

05:45.908 --> 05:50.055
And I go in there, I go in there, ready to do battle.

05:50.761 --> 05:56.066
And I try not to bid on something unless I'm really going to own it.

05:57.328 --> 06:03.694
Because I usually try to get what I go after if I can, without being ridiculous.

06:04.936 --> 06:18.810
But if you go after the best objects in this particular class, if you go after the best object in this particular class, what you've got is a situation where invariably you're going to usually pay more money than what people think is going to go for.

06:19.364 --> 06:22.908
You have to be prepared to do that.

06:22.928 --> 06:24.329
You have to go in with that understanding.

06:24.349 --> 06:27.513
You have to go in with that understanding because the best always commands a premium.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.855
It's just the way life is.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.298
But you never lose with the best.

06:32.318 --> 06:32.618
Never.

06:32.678 --> 06:33.839
And here's another thing.

06:34.099 --> 06:35.541
Do you look at these as investments?

06:36.382 --> 06:36.542
No.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.564
And I think that's a very important point to make.

06:38.584 --> 06:43.329
In fact, I lecture on this.

06:43.349 --> 06:44.190
From time to time.

06:44.542 --> 06:49.326
They asked me, or asked Lori, or there was a lecture in our collection about how we started.

06:51.528 --> 06:53.090
And we've become authorities in certain areas.

06:53.951 --> 06:54.871
What are your authorities?

06:55.412 --> 07:02.999
Well, I guess authorities on American furniture, paintings, things like that.

07:03.019 --> 07:11.967
And when I talk to new collectors, the most important thing I stress

07:12.605 --> 07:41.228
is that you should never buy an object as an investment because he talks to any great collector and they will tell you that they never bought as an investment they bought it because they had to have it they loved it they couldn't live without it it is an investment i mean a priori it's an investment uh but you don't think of it that way good objects will always take care of themselves that's me as a true collector yes

07:41.461 --> 07:55.396
You must never, because there's a process, and no one's been able to scientifically evaluate this, but I believe that there's a process where one is thinking with his head instead of his heart, if he's thinking of an investment.

07:55.996 --> 07:59.280
And the things he's thinking about is what's in this year, what's going to be in next year.

07:59.320 --> 08:06.367
And when you start making those decisions, you invariably set yourself up to make some wrong decisions.

08:07.308 --> 08:09.831
You buy something because you have to have it, because you love it.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.702
You're making a right decision, and the right decision is twofold.

08:15.403 --> 08:17.887
One is right because you love it, you're going to hang it, or you're going to live with it.

08:19.109 --> 08:25.058
And up or down in the price means nothing because you want to have the object anyway.

08:25.078 --> 08:31.228
And I don't know what the answer is, but it's always, it's always, the object always pays for itself.

08:31.462 --> 08:40.051
You also made it certain that scarcely a day goes by when you don't get something.

08:40.071 --> 08:42.054
Is that an exaggeration in some sense?

08:42.074 --> 08:42.654
No, really.

08:42.794 --> 08:47.440
If I'm not buying something, my wife is.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.261
We're always out.

08:49.182 --> 08:50.062
She's in the shops.

08:50.903 --> 08:52.465
I'm walking up and down Madison Avenue.

08:53.266 --> 08:57.090
I'm inundated with catalogs.

08:57.110 --> 09:01.435
Antique catalogs, art catalogs, book catalogs.

09:01.803 --> 09:03.164
Healers call me up all the time.

09:03.645 --> 09:13.995
We're always, I'm always in, in fact, when we come back to the office to look at my desk, we'll see altars of various objects and stuff.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.736
Every day, I would say.

09:15.756 --> 09:25.286
Well, maybe a slight exaggeration, but I would say we must buy four or five hundred things a year.

09:26.207 --> 09:27.968
I don't know.

09:27.988 --> 09:28.248
It's amazing.

09:28.269 --> 09:28.789
Is there a,

09:29.242 --> 09:33.746
Is there a scheme, a grand scheme?

09:33.766 --> 09:35.267
Well, it's a twofold scheme.

09:35.347 --> 09:36.248
It's a twofold scheme.

09:36.268 --> 09:39.851
Satisfying this need to require, I wonder.

09:39.871 --> 09:46.156
Well, it's a... I guess this scheme is twofold.

09:49.059 --> 09:54.183
One, it's the... We're building certain collections.

09:56.405 --> 09:58.607
I'm building a major book collection.

09:58.874 --> 10:12.211
of some of the great high spots in world literature, some of the wonderful high spots in American and English fiction manuscripts.

10:16.176 --> 10:22.384
We're building a collection today of federal furniture, American federal furniture.

10:22.583 --> 10:26.887
We're putting the finishing touches on our American painting collection.

10:28.369 --> 10:31.872
And then we're always buying objet d'art.

10:31.892 --> 10:36.857
I mean, we're always buying little things, big things, just things that strike our fancy.

10:37.497 --> 10:39.179
Do you keep all of these in your home?

10:39.199 --> 10:41.682
Well, a lot of it's there.

10:41.702 --> 10:43.103
A lot of it's in museums.

10:43.683 --> 10:47.427
We have a gallery of the Art Institute of Chicago in our name.

10:48.328 --> 10:50.430
We have two rooms in the Metropolitan Museum.

10:50.782 --> 10:53.445
We have a building at Winnetour.

10:56.148 --> 10:57.110
Started with 60 bucks.

10:58.131 --> 10:59.793
What can I tell you?

10:59.813 --> 11:07.222
When we spoke once on the phone, you mentioned that you have collected so many different things.

11:07.242 --> 11:11.186
You still say that books, you said that books were your first book.

11:11.206 --> 11:11.287
Yes.

11:11.307 --> 11:12.047
It's very interesting.

11:12.108 --> 11:14.250
You recall going down to the 4th Avenue shop.

11:14.270 --> 11:14.691
Yes.

11:14.971 --> 11:15.411
Good memory.

11:17.414 --> 11:18.655
Let's just hold for one second.

11:18.675 --> 11:19.236
We're ordering.

11:21.545 --> 11:23.807
I guess I asked if you're a native New Yorker, right?

11:23.827 --> 11:25.969
Yes, I am.

11:25.989 --> 11:33.595
Born and bred, traveled the world, but New York has always been my home base.

11:33.615 --> 11:35.077
And, you know, you get very provincial.

11:35.117 --> 11:37.278
New Yorkers are very provincial.

11:37.298 --> 11:38.760
You know, it's like a small town in the way.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.221
We never heard that.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.102
Yeah.

11:41.122 --> 11:44.885
And we are pretty set in our ways.

11:47.427 --> 11:50.910
Business opportunities in New York are tremendous.

11:51.076 --> 11:52.017
So I've always stayed here.

11:54.400 --> 12:03.409
But I spent enough time in a lot of other places that I've never felt trapped.

12:05.331 --> 12:10.197
And getting back to your question about books, it's interesting.

12:10.217 --> 12:11.858
Books have always been my first love.

12:14.301 --> 12:18.906
Yet I never thought of putting a book collection together

12:19.190 --> 12:28.784
Because I always bought books, whether retail, new books, or haunted used bookshops since I'm a child.

12:30.346 --> 12:33.952
And never thought of it as a collection, just bought books in used bookshops.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.075
Bought them mainly for their content.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.318
Mainly for their content.

12:38.338 --> 12:45.248
And as a child, a typical Saturday...

12:47.000 --> 12:52.647
As a youngster, I would be going down to the 4th Avenue bookshops.

12:52.667 --> 12:58.315
I lived up in the Bronx at the time, which is quite a ways.

12:58.856 --> 13:11.212
I think the subway into Manhattan, all the way down to Astor Place, which is in lower Manhattan, and then walk up 4th Avenue, hitting all the bookshops.

13:12.173 --> 13:16.078
And then that's pretty close to 14th Street.

13:16.784 --> 13:27.940
and Union Square, where S. Cline's used to be the major discount holder, and then walk from there to Central Park West and 96th Street, which is quite a walk.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.902
You would do this regularly?

13:29.022 --> 13:32.367
Regularly on a Saturday afternoon, and then hit the subway and go back to the Bronx.

13:32.587 --> 13:32.988
How old?

13:33.609 --> 13:36.213
I guess I was 15, 16.

13:36.513 --> 13:36.914
Really?

13:38.456 --> 13:38.556
Yeah.

13:39.548 --> 13:42.913
Did you get many books on these excursions?

13:42.933 --> 13:43.634
Not a lot.

13:43.774 --> 13:44.535
It was more and more.

13:44.595 --> 13:45.677
I love to browse.

13:46.398 --> 13:47.900
I'd love to browse books.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.181
I'd buy a few books.

13:49.902 --> 13:50.784
One or two or three.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.466
Were you looking for anything in particular?

13:52.846 --> 13:54.228
Well, in those days, yeah.

13:54.268 --> 14:00.016
Talk is an opportunity, but in those days, I was really interested in science fiction and fantasy.

14:00.057 --> 14:09.049
There was a renaissance in the early 50s

14:09.620 --> 14:37.922
a science fiction renaissance of course today we're saying there's a science fiction renaissance but the first real renaissance in science fiction was in the early 50s and I remember going to Philadelphia to the Philadelphia chapter to a convention

14:38.408 --> 14:40.391
was one of the early, early conventions.

14:40.511 --> 14:44.096
Today, conventions are a dime a dozen, but this is one of the early important conventions.

14:45.078 --> 14:51.427
And I remember L. Ron Hubbard had just written Dianetics.

14:53.150 --> 15:07.791
And W. W. Campbell, Jr., who was, I think, his brother-in-law at the time, and also the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, was expounding for about two or three hours on how fantastic Dianetics was.

15:08.783 --> 15:15.830
and how involved I was in this pseudoscience.

15:15.850 --> 15:36.149
And I remember Ted Sturgeon, who was one of the great science fiction writers, composed some music for Robert Heinlein's The Green Hills of Earth.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.570
Are you familiar with any of this stuff?

15:38.111 --> 15:38.571
OK.

15:38.737 --> 15:44.806
I'll get away from that.

15:44.826 --> 16:08.018
I guess in my book collecting, I finally decided to collect books in the... about six or seven years ago because I decided to build a house

16:08.302 --> 16:14.711
And have a library in the brand style, which I'd always admired in my travels to antique houses.

16:16.895 --> 16:25.587
And I wanted the spacious rooms, spacious room, the circular staircase.

16:26.809 --> 16:30.474
And I accomplished that.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.597
This is something that you have done.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.098
I have done.

16:33.118 --> 16:33.899
I accomplished that.

16:34.080 --> 16:34.360
And...

16:34.576 --> 16:41.465
Today, my books are housed in this wonderful Georgian-style library.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.888
I hope at some point that you'll allow me to see this.

16:43.908 --> 16:44.589
Yes, of course.

16:44.609 --> 16:45.650
Oh, absolutely.

16:45.770 --> 16:52.979
And let me say, I'll even put this on the tape to reassure you, by the way, this is important.

16:52.999 --> 16:55.002
I will in no way betray the location.

16:55.342 --> 16:57.445
Okay?

16:57.830 --> 17:06.150
This is a concern that people have, and I'm extremely sensitive to it, and very respectful of it.

17:07.413 --> 17:07.954
Thank you.

17:08.034 --> 17:11.182
I mean, I say this on the tape, and some of it is here.

17:11.743 --> 17:13.307
No, I know that.

17:13.827 --> 17:17.070
We had a kidnapping scare with a door.

17:17.190 --> 17:20.513
I mean, you're a native New Yorker and you built the house.

17:20.593 --> 17:22.655
I mean, that's about as far as it goes.

17:22.675 --> 17:29.301
I mean, I'm not going to in no way identify the county or the city or anything like that.

17:29.321 --> 17:35.066
I don't know who's going to be reading my book anyway, but I think I will.

17:35.086 --> 17:41.232
The collection here owns us.

17:41.532 --> 17:42.433
We don't own it.

17:43.477 --> 17:45.820
And you're very restrained.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.103
Wow.

17:49.124 --> 17:50.665
Elaborate on that.

17:51.186 --> 17:53.048
That's a new quote from me.

17:53.749 --> 17:57.073
And does it own you in the sense that you can't move it?

17:57.273 --> 17:59.215
Does it own you in the sense that it also possesses you?

17:59.315 --> 18:07.305
It possesses you, but it also owns you because you're bound to it.

18:07.345 --> 18:09.467
You're bound to your collection.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.309
There are times we can't leave.

18:11.390 --> 18:18.858
If my couple is away, we don't leave the house.

18:18.878 --> 18:20.240
There's always somebody home.

18:21.241 --> 18:28.830
I have the most sophisticated security system imagined.

18:28.850 --> 18:34.757
Yet, there's always somebody in the house.

18:34.777 --> 18:36.619
I never went down at the Gardner this week.

18:38.236 --> 18:39.558
state-of-the-art, right?

18:39.578 --> 18:40.059
Exactly.

18:40.079 --> 18:42.583
But unfortunately, he wants to bust his way in.

18:42.744 --> 18:45.729
The point is, some things might be foolproof, but they're not idiot-proof.

18:46.330 --> 18:51.478
And if you have some clown that's going to open the door to people and he's been specifically told not to open the door to people... Exactly.

18:52.099 --> 18:53.382
I mean, that's tragic.

18:53.422 --> 18:54.844
That's the...

18:55.465 --> 18:56.927
I mean, I'm sick about that.

18:57.007 --> 19:02.032
A garden and museum, to me, is something I'd rather have past the time of the year.

19:02.993 --> 19:06.877
And usually right around now, just before Easter, they bring in all the flowers.

19:07.578 --> 19:10.501
They bring my daughters to see this place.

19:11.082 --> 19:15.706
And I almost, not that you can't, but you almost feel like there's been a rape over there.

19:15.727 --> 19:18.850
There has been a rape, no questions.

19:18.870 --> 19:22.974
They happen to have what, to me, is the greatest Rembrandt painting.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.696
I love that shipwreck.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.156
You see a Galilee and it knocks me out.

19:29.759 --> 19:31.161
I love the Vermeer myself.

19:31.261 --> 19:33.865
It's a great Vermeer.

19:33.885 --> 19:36.789
I mean, there's only 34 of them.

19:36.969 --> 19:40.174
It's like getting a Shakespeare in a way, isn't it?

19:44.019 --> 19:44.340
Yes.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.686
Anyway, we can get sidetracked here as we were talking about.

19:48.706 --> 19:50.228
All off, though, on the...

19:50.545 --> 19:58.192
The collection owns you yourself with respect to the fact that you can't leave it or you can't leave it?

19:58.212 --> 20:00.093
Number one, it's a great responsibility.

20:03.817 --> 20:15.186
You have to worry about taking care of the objects, restoring the objects, serving the objects.

20:15.206 --> 20:19.270
Objects must always be under protection.

20:20.110 --> 20:20.972
Got to be insured.

20:21.713 --> 20:24.078
Very expensive.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.701
Be taken care of by the curator.

20:26.242 --> 20:26.984
You do have a curator?

20:27.004 --> 20:27.184
Oh, yes.

20:27.344 --> 20:27.805
Oh, that's wonderful.

20:28.366 --> 20:30.150
For the books, too?

20:30.250 --> 20:32.154
Well, not really.

20:32.976 --> 20:35.200
And I should, but I'm sort of the curator.

20:35.652 --> 20:43.620
I think books, which is, again, a theory, got a theory in mind, but I think the book collector really is his own.

20:44.581 --> 20:50.266
The book isn't really something that you put on the wall that you can share the beauty with other people.

20:50.286 --> 20:57.633
I think generally, and one thing I had really found when I was out of Bill Scheide's house two weeks ago today, not his house, his library.

20:59.975 --> 21:01.217
He had to go to a dinner party.

21:01.297 --> 21:01.717
He called.

21:01.757 --> 21:04.680
He had his librarian call his wife to say he can be late.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.285
I said, Mr. Charity, please.

21:06.305 --> 21:09.890
He said, no, it's not often you get a chance to share the books.

21:09.910 --> 21:12.174
You know, somebody who knows the books.

21:12.254 --> 21:12.814
Exactly.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.437
I appreciate them as much as I do.

21:14.457 --> 21:18.443
And I'm sitting there with his Gutenberg Bible on my lap.

21:18.463 --> 21:20.766
And I said, really, I'd much rather do this.

21:20.786 --> 21:23.250
He said, no, no, you've got to feel the type.

21:23.290 --> 21:25.012
You have to feel the paperwork.

21:25.032 --> 21:28.457
We're tight to get the paper for the first time in history.

21:29.146 --> 21:31.670
Yeah, I got a little white-headed.

21:32.291 --> 21:32.572
True.

21:32.972 --> 21:35.596
But Leonard Baskin and his wife were the same way.

21:35.676 --> 21:37.339
I was there on a Sunday.

21:37.359 --> 21:38.922
Well, I said, I got to go.

21:38.942 --> 21:45.372
They said, no, no, no, it's not often we have a chance to share our books with people.

21:45.392 --> 21:49.078
So I took books in a way are one-on-one.

21:49.447 --> 21:53.011
kind of, maybe a more of that, but I think that it's a one-on-one thing.

21:53.031 --> 21:57.977
And where you say you have a curator for your artworks and all the others, but the books you kind of take care of yourself.

21:57.997 --> 21:59.459
That's your own pet writing.

21:59.479 --> 21:59.900
Sure.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.260
I guess.

22:00.560 --> 22:00.881
Absolutely.

22:00.901 --> 22:01.802
Is that an assumption?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.224
No, it's my pet writing.

22:04.285 --> 22:06.187
Yeah.

22:07.148 --> 22:07.909
I pet my books.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.813
I find myself petting the books.

22:10.933 --> 22:14.157
One of my questions at one point is, how do you enjoy them?

22:15.058 --> 22:17.301
How do you go about enjoying them?

22:17.321 --> 22:18.542
Aside from reading,

22:19.265 --> 22:26.036
reading them, the pleasure of discovering what I own.

22:26.657 --> 22:28.239
You know, you rediscover it.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.042
If you have a big library, you rediscover things.

22:32.406 --> 22:43.483
And each time I come back to the library, the pleasure of taking the books out, leafing through the volumes,

22:45.303 --> 22:49.288
discovering some nuance.

22:49.308 --> 22:59.580
It's highly pleasurable, and it's something that can only be... How are you doing?

22:59.600 --> 23:00.381
How are you doing?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.109
Everybody who knows you speak very highly.

23:07.129 --> 23:07.890
You know that?

23:08.070 --> 23:11.774
Thank you.

23:11.794 --> 23:14.938
You know, I mean, I talk to people and...

23:15.357 --> 23:16.219
I haven't yet.

23:17.521 --> 23:24.954
I have at least a dozen people who know you, without exception, speak very highly.

23:24.974 --> 23:27.899
Nice to know that you're... Because one never knows how they're perceived by others.

23:27.919 --> 23:38.918
And I would never even have said that if that gentleman hadn't just, you know, validated to know what... Nice.

23:39.708 --> 23:41.590
Let's describe your collection.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.214
You said it's a high-spot collection.

23:44.234 --> 23:51.223
I guess at some point, you said six or seven years ago, it started with the idea of a library.

23:51.243 --> 23:51.583
It's interesting.

23:51.603 --> 23:53.085
Yes.

23:53.105 --> 23:57.010
It was sort of a challenge.

23:57.030 --> 24:08.044
Could I put together an important collection of books?

24:09.644 --> 24:14.210
It's such a late date in my career.

24:17.114 --> 24:30.312
Being that had I started, say, 20 years ago, and I started collecting 20 years earlier, I started collecting other things.

24:31.714 --> 24:35.680
And now I'm thinking to myself that I didn't start at the same time collecting books.

24:37.382 --> 24:38.183
But I think in...

24:38.382 --> 24:44.269
What happens in life is you... It's a time for everything.

24:44.289 --> 24:49.736
Timing... Things happen when you want them to happen.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.898
I'm a firm believer in that.

24:51.198 --> 24:57.646
And I was ready to dive in to truly collecting antiquarian books at this time in my life.

24:58.548 --> 24:59.689
How old are you?

24:59.829 --> 25:02.152
Well, I'm 53 now.

25:02.232 --> 25:07.038
I started collecting, I guess, 46 or so.

25:07.058 --> 25:07.579
And...

25:07.880 --> 25:10.405
If I ask you your age, I have to tell you mine.

25:10.625 --> 25:11.387
No, not at all.

25:11.467 --> 25:12.048
Not at all.

25:13.451 --> 25:18.280
What I've learned in this previous time, when I'm not working, I'm very reserved.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.045
But when I'm working, there isn't anything I won't ask you.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.353
Well, you have to.

25:22.393 --> 25:24.596
You have to be... No, no.

25:25.857 --> 25:26.958
You can't be reserved.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.102
You have to because it's... Yes.

25:30.122 --> 25:32.985
But you're going to put a study together.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.949
But you brought the point up at this point in my life.

25:37.130 --> 25:37.670
Absolutely.

25:37.690 --> 25:39.232
And please understand.

25:39.572 --> 25:42.015
There's nothing that you can't ask me about.

25:42.035 --> 25:42.696
I sincerely mean that.

25:43.116 --> 25:45.138
And all you have to say is no in any business.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.480
I wouldn't be ashamed.

25:46.820 --> 25:47.681
But there isn't before.

25:47.741 --> 25:50.104
No, but there really is nothing that I...

25:50.084 --> 26:02.597
Believe if you're gonna do a study Then you got to do it if you're gonna write a great you're gonna put together a great book about a subject Then you got to do the right thing.

26:02.617 --> 26:15.970
You got to go after it You don't do it right if it comes wishy-washy, you know what I mean, you know, you know what I'm doing I'm trying to do a very good book, but I want you to and I don't want it to be Is that right?

26:16.031 --> 26:17.492
I got to see you after Freeman

26:18.012 --> 26:20.957
Arthur will tell you stories you won't believe.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.158
He's a great, great guy.

26:22.178 --> 26:25.063
Arthur, you'll love him.

26:25.303 --> 26:28.468
I will call him, don't worry.

26:28.488 --> 26:30.031
Just before you came in.

26:30.051 --> 26:30.812
Are you crazy?

26:30.912 --> 26:31.293
Of course I will.

26:31.313 --> 26:32.655
That's very nice.

26:32.675 --> 26:35.259
Just ten minutes before you came in, let's talk to Arthur.

26:35.279 --> 26:37.222
It's got to be a good book, you know.

26:37.382 --> 26:39.125
In fact, you will see, Arthur.

26:39.145 --> 26:42.450
He will be up for the British part of the sale.

26:42.937 --> 26:46.060
I'll be back.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.703
I'm coming back in the 22nd.

26:48.723 --> 26:50.505
That's the 28th, 29th, I think, right?

26:50.565 --> 26:52.807
Yeah, something like that.

26:52.827 --> 26:54.028
21st off, I don't see him.

26:54.048 --> 26:55.369
I will see him.

26:55.389 --> 26:56.430
You don't see him in London.

26:56.450 --> 26:59.093
He'll be in town for at least a week or 10 days.

27:00.374 --> 27:01.516
You'll go to dinner with us.

27:02.116 --> 27:02.517
Thank you.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.700
You're in town, because I'm having dinner with him and his wife, and I'm going to come to dinner with us.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.320
That sounds great.

27:06.521 --> 27:07.081
Absolutely.

27:07.401 --> 27:08.362
That's for sure.

27:08.422 --> 27:09.544
Thanks.

27:09.584 --> 27:10.024
Thanks.

27:10.477 --> 27:31.776
you know who she is she was she was the curator of the shiny collection janet yes she's now janna freeman she's she's bill stoneman's predecessor she'll tell you everything she's the leading authority on

27:32.397 --> 27:34.240
Of course she would be.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.946
She's written a marvelous treatise book on it.

27:37.966 --> 27:38.067
Yeah.

27:38.608 --> 27:40.270
Everybody said I should talk to you.

27:40.290 --> 27:40.791
It's amazing.

27:41.152 --> 27:42.735
Do you have?

27:42.775 --> 27:42.975
Yeah.

27:44.598 --> 27:45.559
Look out for dinner.

27:45.780 --> 27:46.761
I won't let you forget it.

27:46.781 --> 27:47.162
Please don't.

27:47.362 --> 27:47.723
I won't.

27:47.990 --> 27:49.452
Because I really want you to.

27:49.472 --> 27:52.156
Now let's go back to the focus of your collection.

27:52.176 --> 27:54.579
You'll meet Gloria and the whole thing and the grand.

27:54.699 --> 27:56.622
I might even bring my wife down.

27:56.682 --> 27:57.043
Please.

27:57.323 --> 27:58.184
That would be wonderful.

27:58.264 --> 27:59.446
I would love it.

27:59.646 --> 28:00.848
I will make reservations.

28:01.008 --> 28:03.572
We'll pick a date that's convenient for you.

28:03.592 --> 28:06.917
Arthur left to my description.

28:07.177 --> 28:09.801
The only reason we collect, I can collect.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.223
Madly.

28:12.004 --> 28:13.626
I mean, to my level.

28:14.315 --> 28:36.745
Remember, I was paying $10 a week and I was paying $50 a month.

28:37.332 --> 28:40.850
because you have to buy it, and you buy it whatever level you have.

28:40.870 --> 28:42.960
Do you buy duplicate copies and things?

28:42.980 --> 28:44.086
I have duplicate copies.

28:44.106 --> 28:45.553
You're not supposed to, but I do.

28:46.073 --> 28:48.658
I've got four copies of Island Garden.

28:49.199 --> 28:49.720
Sure.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.201
Yes.

28:50.321 --> 28:52.244
I've got all the illustrations.

28:52.304 --> 28:53.126
I've got all the books.

28:53.246 --> 28:55.170
Every book that Charles Hassan has.

28:55.190 --> 28:56.732
Island Garden Hassan's.

28:56.752 --> 28:57.113
Yes.

28:57.233 --> 29:01.241
I had one of the original drawings from Island Garden and sold it a few years ago.

29:01.301 --> 29:01.882
What a shame.

29:02.162 --> 29:03.284
You could not have done that.

29:03.304 --> 29:03.565
I know.

29:03.605 --> 29:04.406
Now that I know you do.

29:04.426 --> 29:05.288
Hassan is way up there.

29:05.308 --> 29:09.195
When you come to my home, I have the greatest Hassan in the world.

29:09.378 --> 29:11.400
I have a Hassan that's kind of like him.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.562
I have a Hassan that's bigger than this.

29:13.842 --> 29:14.263
Come on.

29:14.503 --> 29:14.903
Oh, yeah.

29:14.923 --> 29:16.885
This Hassan.

29:16.905 --> 29:18.887
This Hassan was his most pivotal picture.

29:19.107 --> 29:20.289
It was called Rue Bonaparte.

29:21.350 --> 29:23.131
It was done in Paris.

29:25.654 --> 29:30.879
It was his pivotal picture when he was moving from realism into impressions.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.340
Phenomenal piece.

29:34.042 --> 29:37.225
I am the person responsible for this.

29:37.981 --> 29:42.245
He's doing the book on it.

29:43.226 --> 29:45.208
He's doing Hassan's resume right now.

29:45.468 --> 29:46.449
He is?

29:46.469 --> 29:48.451
Stuart is the leading authority on Hassan.

29:48.971 --> 29:49.612
He's here in town?

29:49.792 --> 29:52.595
Oh, it's the finest American art gallery in the country.

29:52.615 --> 29:54.837
Finest American art gallery in the country.

29:54.917 --> 29:56.258
I've got a few Hassan things.

29:56.278 --> 29:57.339
I'll mention my name.

29:57.419 --> 29:57.580
I will.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.944
I've got one book which has Hassan lithographs that is so early.

30:02.544 --> 30:05.507
According to the guy who did the impressionism book.

30:06.635 --> 30:08.678
I have the complete woodcuts.

30:08.718 --> 30:09.959
Well, I should, yeah.

30:09.979 --> 30:17.549
I have the complete woodcuts of Homer's, uh, I have Homer's woodcuts from the, uh, Harper's Weekend, all of them, every one of them.

30:17.569 --> 30:20.633
Do you have the ones from Belouse, Victoria?

30:22.216 --> 30:23.077
Every Saturday?

30:23.117 --> 30:23.537
Do you?

30:23.617 --> 30:24.799
Yeah, I don't have any of the others.

30:24.819 --> 30:25.500
Every Saturday, St.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.544
Nicholas, Belouse, I don't have, I have all the ones, uh, every one of them.

30:28.564 --> 30:32.389
I get the very first wood engraving he ever did with Belouse.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.886
I have a wonderful collection of Homer.

30:35.906 --> 30:37.628
I love Homer.

30:38.449 --> 30:40.292
He is spectacular.

30:40.312 --> 30:52.527
This is delicious, isn't it?

30:52.547 --> 30:54.009
Oh, yes.

30:56.572 --> 30:56.813
Would I lie?

30:56.833 --> 31:00.317
What were we talking about about the books?

31:00.337 --> 31:00.958
Again, focus, focus.

31:01.580 --> 31:04.123
We were just talking about how you enjoyed it.

31:04.143 --> 31:05.465
Oh, yeah.

31:05.485 --> 31:18.823
To me, I can't explain it to you, but everything I own, or don't own, a book, to me, is referential.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.131
It's holy, in a way, I guess.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.055
It's hard to explain.

31:28.075 --> 31:30.118
I guess it goes back to my uncle, who was a great...

31:31.280 --> 31:36.887
Great bookworm, a bibliophile.

31:36.907 --> 31:40.892
Jerome Iver, B-I-V-E-R.

31:41.113 --> 31:46.680
My uncle lived with us as a kid.

31:48.262 --> 31:54.110
And he used to go down.

31:54.650 --> 31:58.215
His great pleasure was in 4th Avenue bookshops.

31:58.313 --> 32:00.416
Did he introduce you to this then?

32:00.436 --> 32:02.899
He introduced me to it, yes.

32:02.919 --> 32:16.155
And he collected philosophy, sociology, and fantasy.

32:16.436 --> 32:19.039
He was reading Tolkien when Tolkien was first published.

32:23.605 --> 32:27.730
Dave and Volkney, great science fiction writers,

32:28.418 --> 32:54.038
the time they were publishing and collecting their books his world really was uh philosophy science sociology mathematics and he collected all the great writers was his collection good well it wasn't antiquarian it was uh it was contemporary

32:55.283 --> 33:06.862
He would shave all the dust jackets by taking them off.

33:06.882 --> 33:08.247
I love that.

33:09.830 --> 33:22.690
And once told me, which I've never been able to prove, but sounds right, that in the earlier days, dust jackets were obviously meaningless.

33:22.891 --> 33:23.592
They threw them away.

33:23.612 --> 33:26.917
They threw them away, and a library had to be standard.

33:26.937 --> 33:33.407
And if you had no dust jackets, there was more of a standardization than if you had some dust jackets and no dust jackets.

33:34.130 --> 33:45.392
I mean, people used to take them and throw them away, but I don't know how anybody could do that, because there is very interesting ephemeral information on a test jacket.

33:45.412 --> 33:48.538
You should be able to recognize that.

33:48.558 --> 33:49.781
You'd think people would recognize that.

33:49.801 --> 33:52.386
Well, there's no reason for that.

33:52.406 --> 33:56.053
Only in America, in England, in England,

33:56.759 --> 34:00.365
The original dust jackets in England and America had nothing on them but the title.

34:00.405 --> 34:01.147
They were just rappers.

34:01.187 --> 34:01.888
They were just rappers.

34:02.970 --> 34:07.238
And in England, almost to this day, well, not to this day, it's changed after the Second World War.

34:07.258 --> 34:15.973
But after the Second World War, if you look at most of the books, there's very little information on the dust jacket on English books.

34:15.993 --> 34:18.177
Isar Kipling Kim.

34:19.523 --> 34:20.724
And all it was was the title.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.008
It's a cream-colored... That's right, you know.

34:24.028 --> 34:28.133
And the guy wanted two grand for it, you know, but normally I pay much less.

34:28.154 --> 34:28.714
I have Kim.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.637
I got it for Zeppelin.

34:30.657 --> 34:45.835
I found it in a... Those are the... You have to admit, I mean, you have... I witnessed you at an auction where you went to Heavy Heights and spent two million dollars for four printed books.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.750
Really for one printer burger.

34:47.770 --> 34:48.251
Really?

34:48.311 --> 34:48.932
Actually for two.

34:49.573 --> 34:50.214
The first and the third.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.817
I have the second and the fourth.

34:51.837 --> 34:53.800
Great copies.

34:53.820 --> 34:56.544
So you're really in there for... I was in there for the first and the third.

34:57.586 --> 34:58.227
Really for the first.

34:59.950 --> 35:02.474
They're very interesting bindings, I have to say.

35:02.794 --> 35:03.035
Yes.

35:04.196 --> 35:11.468
And I'm very happy that I have this marvelous set because it has history.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.348
It has a wonderful prominence.

35:13.368 --> 35:14.349
Yes.

35:19.934 --> 35:40.392
And to me, it's the penultimate, it's the penultimate print, it's the penultimate book in literature, set of books in literature, and something I would really not have a shout out again of this quality, because they will not come up at auction of this quality again.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.063
Well, when's the last time a set of war came out?

35:43.083 --> 35:44.164
You know, maybe 40 years.

35:44.264 --> 35:47.428
I don't know the answer to that, but to continue.

35:47.448 --> 35:54.056
Well, there will be another set being offered in catalog at Quarges.

35:55.938 --> 35:57.020
Set I knew about.

35:58.221 --> 36:00.604
In fact, it said that I helped discover.

36:01.805 --> 36:04.749
It may even be that you were considering that.

36:04.789 --> 36:05.970
I was considering that set.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.392
I was considering that set.

36:08.283 --> 36:35.978
in front of the auction but knew that that set was not as good and therefore i was going to take my chances and get the finest available set which is very important you're going to collect and you can afford it collect the best in the category you're going after when you went to that auction or to any auction you told me something earlier that i hadn't realized

36:36.363 --> 36:41.975
is that it gives you a kick, the kind of kick that you used to get from gambling.

36:42.315 --> 36:45.121
And do you mind if I say this, by the way, in my piece?

36:45.362 --> 36:46.845
I thought that you enjoyed it.

36:46.865 --> 36:47.947
I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.

36:48.288 --> 36:54.942
I was at the Sands last week, and I'll estimate the first one would finish.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.806
I'm a crapshooter.

36:56.826 --> 36:57.106
I love boxing.

36:57.126 --> 36:57.527
Hold on.

36:59.482 --> 37:04.789
Do you go in with an idea that you're only going to allow yourself to spend so much?

37:04.969 --> 37:06.892
I never have in my entire life.

37:07.773 --> 37:10.417
I've never set a limit on what I was going to spend.

37:10.437 --> 37:16.265
I never said to myself that this is worth $1,000 and I'll go to $1,000 or $1,200 or whatever.

37:17.406 --> 37:21.692
But then I go and I look at a piece, and if I have to own it,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.363
I will then go and see what it's going to go for.

37:25.743 --> 37:29.209
If I want to spend the amount of money that it's going to go for, I go for it.

37:29.269 --> 37:31.752
Why did you not get the Don Quixote then?

37:31.993 --> 37:45.412
Because I saw what it was going for and felt that at $1.650 million, I didn't want it to go higher than that price to buy that book.

37:45.492 --> 37:47.916
But I didn't set a price.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.700
I just made it so clear.

37:51.035 --> 37:57.666
In other words, if something is estimated... No, that was estimated at $200,000.

37:57.686 --> 37:58.287
$200,000 to $300,000.

37:58.928 --> 38:02.052
I said to myself, I know I'm going to spend more than $200,000 or $300,000.

38:02.093 --> 38:03.595
Let's see what it goes for.

38:04.216 --> 38:05.718
And I bid to $650,000.

38:06.319 --> 38:07.441
Oh, you bid it to $650,000?

38:07.942 --> 38:08.142
Oh, yeah.

38:08.162 --> 38:13.110
And then... And I said...

38:13.630 --> 38:15.513
Let those who want to buy it.

38:15.713 --> 38:17.656
You know, and it really was worth a million six fifty.

38:17.716 --> 38:19.258
No question it was worth it.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.320
They undervalued that.

38:22.002 --> 38:23.965
But you also performed a service in a way.

38:24.606 --> 38:28.232
You realize that prior to that sale there was no copy of that in Spain?

38:29.414 --> 38:30.916
Yes, I knew that too.

38:30.936 --> 38:33.660
It was the only copy now in Spain.

38:34.040 --> 38:41.832
I also knew that there was a Spanish collector who really wanted that book and was prepared to go.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.664
I don't know what he was prepared to go for, but I knew he would spend.

38:45.684 --> 38:49.048
Well, his commitment to that book was probably as great as your commitment to Shakespeare.

38:49.088 --> 38:49.549
Exactly.

38:49.709 --> 38:54.635
And I felt that Shakespeare was coming up.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.378
So let's hold, you know, hang loose.

38:57.438 --> 38:58.119
Hang loose, that's it.

38:58.499 --> 39:00.261
The other thing... There's always another day.

39:00.782 --> 39:02.063
There's also another reason.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.207
This is interesting, by the way.

39:05.227 --> 39:07.309
Yes, we are getting some insight into that.

39:07.350 --> 39:10.413
Very important.

39:10.433 --> 39:11.194
I was offered...

39:11.748 --> 39:39.848
a set of Don Quixote in original vellum just less than one year ago for $150,000 coming in from Colombia supposedly purchased by a these two sisters who wanted to sell it rather

39:40.655 --> 39:47.505
and a curator of one of the local museums in Columbia, South America, was coming up to sell it for them.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.448
That's an interesting story.

39:49.469 --> 40:08.738
Through a dealer friend of mine, who although is very knowledgeable in many books, his limits are 19th and 20th century, and he felt that

40:09.494 --> 40:24.547
Although they looked good, someone from Quarge, who knew the books, who knows Darth Quixote, that's one book they have, should come and look at them.

40:24.847 --> 40:33.675
And Quarge came as a favor, and unfortunately they were facsimiles.

40:33.835 --> 40:37.999
In original film, but facsimiles, one of those early

40:38.435 --> 40:42.570
Really early 19th century facsimiles.

40:42.590 --> 40:44.155
But it's been a very good facsimile.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.179
A fabulous facsimile.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.444
A facsimile nonetheless.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.872
Too worth owning, but only in that context.

40:48.933 --> 40:49.896
Only in that context.

40:50.095 --> 40:52.159
You know, like it would be worth owning some of the T.J.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.341
Wise's things.

40:53.421 --> 40:54.402
Exactly.

40:54.422 --> 40:54.723
Exactly.

40:54.743 --> 41:07.905
So having $150,000 in my head and seeing the $200,000 to $300,000 estimate and going to $650,000, I figured, uh, strawberries.

41:07.925 --> 41:08.747
I'm sorry, raspberries.

41:08.767 --> 41:12.353
I'm sorry, raspberries.

41:12.874 --> 41:13.154
Uh, no.

41:13.174 --> 41:14.196
Uh, strawberries pretty good.

41:14.328 --> 41:43.862
after seeing those prices 150 i thought i was going to spend two to three hundred that was estimate and going to 650 i figured i i did a yeoman job uh when i went for me in 650 i figured what the heck let them happen you were after the book of daniel i think i was after the book of daniel um and should have gone more i don't know why i hesitated i guess i uh i guess i felt that i was overpaying for it but without realizing that when is the next time i'm going to get an opportunity at a whole book

41:44.197 --> 41:47.521
You see, I started thinking, what is it worth for Paige?

41:47.561 --> 41:48.562
And that was the worst thing.

41:48.582 --> 41:49.323
I'd never do that.

41:49.363 --> 41:51.345
Now, were you thinking this as it's going on?

41:51.365 --> 41:53.087
Yeah.

41:53.708 --> 41:55.109
Do you have a double decaf espresso?

41:55.690 --> 41:59.835
I'll have a black cup with caffeine.

41:59.855 --> 42:02.478
I need my kicks like that.

42:03.539 --> 42:08.044
And I guess I felt that...

42:08.446 --> 42:09.788
I made a mistake.

42:09.848 --> 42:15.276
I should have bought the... short of having a good version.

42:15.296 --> 42:22.527
I wonder if you... I mean, so clearly there are things that you... Is covet too strong a word to use?

42:22.547 --> 42:22.707
No.

42:23.549 --> 42:25.331
A great collector or a good collector for covets.

42:27.455 --> 42:36.428
But only to... But only in the best sense.

42:38.045 --> 42:42.051
It's not a, uh, coveting in this sense is not a negative thing.

42:42.111 --> 42:57.454
It's wonderful to want to acquire something that gives you pleasure, um, that should be owned by someone who will take care of it.

42:59.196 --> 43:03.242
How large is your library, would you estimate, in your collection?

43:06.209 --> 43:09.413
Well, it's all not antiquarian.

43:09.493 --> 43:24.030
Some of it's modern books and then a lot of interesting but not valuable used books.

43:24.091 --> 43:27.374
Probably about 5,000 books, but not all antiquarian.

43:27.395 --> 43:28.656
Shady library is small.

43:29.227 --> 43:30.769
You know, the Schattie Library is phenomenal.

43:30.789 --> 43:32.671
My library is not Schattie.

43:32.691 --> 43:33.913
I've never seen the Schattie Library.

43:33.933 --> 43:36.416
What I'm saying is... I can imagine all of his books have a quality.

43:36.856 --> 43:40.901
I have a phenomenal... The Aquarian collection is phenomenal.

43:41.982 --> 43:45.807
But the Aquarian collection and the... Let me do it through this one.

43:45.827 --> 43:46.127
Let's see.

43:46.147 --> 43:49.491
The Aquarian collection and the contemporary collection.

43:49.571 --> 43:53.896
And Aquarian, 19th century and modern books.

43:53.937 --> 43:57.681
Not counting the used books.

43:57.948 --> 44:21.103
uh would be about uh i never actually i think you gave me a number which is fine it's not 50 000 books it's like carter burden's at 80 90 000. he got himself born and i'm not asking you to talk about him by the way i know i've never really seen his collection so anything i'm telling you is it's it's third party but but uh

44:21.320 --> 44:34.439
I hear that he wanted to collect American books from 1900 to the present time.

44:36.482 --> 44:43.171
That's a wonderful conception.

44:44.673 --> 44:50.061
It's a never-ending process because

44:50.395 --> 45:01.366
There's too much being, there's too much that was printing, especially since the Second World War.

45:01.386 --> 45:01.986
Unbelievable.

45:02.006 --> 45:06.470
Well, it used to be, you know, the edition was sold 2,200 copies.

45:06.490 --> 45:14.098
After the Second World War, you know, there's just 10,000, 20,000 copies of nothing no more.

45:14.718 --> 45:16.880
What, what, what kind of that?

45:16.900 --> 45:19.643
What happens when you, what, what is it about a first edition?

45:20.180 --> 45:37.280
You know, Charles Lamb once said, people actually should collect 11 editions, they're probably hard to get.

45:37.300 --> 45:40.664
You know, I mean, there's a point.

45:40.684 --> 45:47.892
There's something wonderful about why the

45:48.378 --> 46:17.693
work of an artist and by an artist I mean a writer the way he conceived it and the way he and his publisher put it together or his printer put it together and exactly how he saw it from the press for the first time everything else

46:19.276 --> 46:23.541
It takes second place to the first conceptualization.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.083
This goes to anything.

46:26.324 --> 46:27.786
And why should a book be different?

46:28.607 --> 46:29.908
I'll tell you how far that goes.

46:30.049 --> 46:38.138
I'm trying to put together a collection that's much tougher to do, because there's never that much available of all the original manuscripts.

46:38.899 --> 46:40.421
That's my next question.

46:40.461 --> 46:43.504
Inevitably, the collector of first editions spoke through.

46:43.524 --> 46:44.946
The writer said this to me, he collects.

46:45.297 --> 46:47.960
Inevitably, if you're serious, you have to get into the menu.

46:48.060 --> 46:49.382
Yes, there's no question.

46:49.422 --> 46:58.012
Because what you're trying to do, and you just expressed it very eloquently, is that you're trying to get as close to the source of creation as you possibly can.

46:58.152 --> 47:11.187
If I could find the original hand-printed copies, that the monks did, that's really what I would collect.

47:11.622 --> 47:37.950
I've just gotten tremendously enthused in early Biblical manuscripts, especially how the New Testament came to be and how the Gospels, and how close are the Gospels that we read today, how close are those versions that we read today to how they were originally put down

47:38.048 --> 47:50.785
And I became enamored of the Sinaiticus Bible, the Codex Sinaiticus, which Tischendorf discovered in the 1840s at the Monastery of St.

47:50.805 --> 47:51.285
Catherine.

47:52.147 --> 47:59.416
And I read everything I could about that and the history of how the New Testament came to be written.

47:59.436 --> 48:05.664
And I'm only sorry that I got interested in that exactly one week.

48:06.505 --> 48:07.026
One week.

48:07.495 --> 48:22.392
after the most fabulous second century, third century, third century fragment from the Epistle of St.

48:22.773 --> 48:24.214
Paul to the Romans.

48:25.256 --> 48:35.207
And this had a slightly one word differential in the Epistle, in the fragment, different from the King James Version.

48:36.487 --> 48:43.353
which changes slightly the meaning of that particular paragraph.

48:44.274 --> 48:50.560
Because, as we know in translation, the New Testament is written in Greek.

48:50.580 --> 49:03.372
And the Greek translating from the Greek by the early copyists, early monks, they made mistakes, although they tried not to.

49:03.622 --> 49:07.028
The subtlety, the subtlety of the language.

49:07.068 --> 49:12.418
The change of a word can change a whole concept.

49:12.438 --> 49:15.745
So I got really into this there, reading all the scholarly works.

49:15.885 --> 49:16.947
At an auction?

49:17.167 --> 49:19.251
At a Sotheby auction.

49:19.417 --> 49:48.310
and you missed it missed it went for 90 000 pounds uh in london uh and i missed it because i was i saw it and i wasn't interested in that i got interested in the whole subject a week later killing myself because i went into a library i'll never get out how long ago is this i guess it's about three years ago yeah so this this would be one of the you'd classify this is one of the things that got away this is one of the things that got away that i didn't even know got away after it got away

49:48.577 --> 49:54.765
Because I wasn't interested in it at the time, and did get interested in it.

49:54.785 --> 49:58.711
A week or two later, you probably could have gotten it, so I would have bought it for your question.

49:58.731 --> 49:59.352
At whatever price.

49:59.892 --> 50:02.356
The interest that happens is not more than whatever price.

50:02.376 --> 50:10.887
I guess the question I was asking earlier... Is the earliest manuscript in private hands?

50:10.927 --> 50:12.629
Think about it.

50:12.830 --> 50:14.832
Except for the Egyptian stuff.

50:15.113 --> 50:16.795
Yeah, when I was at Scheidings Library.

50:17.467 --> 50:47.187
Yes.

50:47.335 --> 50:51.105
This is a long way of getting to think.

50:51.125 --> 50:59.266
Now, you were victorious with the Shakespeare's, and you must have felt a rush of satisfaction.

50:59.547 --> 51:04.399
But how about also tell me about some of the victories that

51:04.733 --> 51:33.154
that you get at clement you told me that you could go to every every book fair yeah and i knew enough to call and tell you i'd like to see you today because i knew you would be in town oh absolutely i knew that you would not allow yourself to go someplace on a deal because this is i truly consider myself a junkie when it comes to uh to book fairs

51:33.505 --> 51:37.712
I love to peruse.

51:38.693 --> 51:41.538
To me, I lose myself.

51:41.558 --> 51:42.680
It's a great panacea.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.244
It's wonderful therapy.

51:46.165 --> 51:50.552
I literally get excited when you find something that they don't know about.

51:51.325 --> 51:55.069
and you look around and you see, is this really the price?

51:55.089 --> 51:57.411
Am I really going to be able to get this for 50 bucks or something like that?

51:57.631 --> 51:59.273
Has that ever happened to you?

51:59.313 --> 52:03.397
Well, in books, it's been rare.

52:05.119 --> 52:06.420
It's interesting.

52:08.682 --> 52:13.867
For me, in my antiquarian, in used books, I do it all the time.

52:13.927 --> 52:20.674
I'm always finding books, titles that

52:21.025 --> 52:26.131
I never thought I would find on a flea market or fair.

52:26.151 --> 52:35.981
When it comes to antiquarian books, the other thing I collect, the other prerequisite to what I collect is it has to be in the finest condition possible.

52:37.003 --> 52:42.308
And that you're not going to find except what the finest book there is.

52:42.328 --> 52:47.754
You're not going to find it at... You're going to find them probably with the most reputable dealers in our major league office.

52:47.774 --> 52:48.996
Exactly.

52:49.016 --> 52:49.817
It's the only place.

52:50.517 --> 52:50.998
So...

52:51.181 --> 52:56.447
It's very rare to find a tremendous copy that fits all of my requirements.

52:57.288 --> 53:00.973
So it's not just the book I'm looking for, it's the condition of the book.

53:00.993 --> 53:04.257
Like real estate, location, location, location, condition.

53:04.457 --> 53:08.121
You better really envy that guy who found Tamerlane.

53:08.301 --> 53:08.842
Yes, I do.

53:08.962 --> 53:11.846
I think it's the most wonderful thing in the world.

53:12.366 --> 53:14.048
I keep looking at this.

53:15.330 --> 53:16.791
I think it's fabulous what he did.

53:16.892 --> 53:18.994
Do you know who he is, by the way?

53:19.244 --> 53:24.551
His name was mentioned to me, but I don't know who he is.

53:24.571 --> 53:26.234
John Marion said he did a commercial.

53:26.734 --> 53:30.460
Yeah, I believe it.

53:30.480 --> 53:37.590
He had just started to collect American imprints or something.

53:37.610 --> 53:39.352
He was looking through the old boxes.

53:39.572 --> 53:47.483
It's remarkable.

53:47.503 --> 53:48.745
That could have been me.

53:49.771 --> 53:51.012
How did that go up?

53:51.032 --> 53:52.193
Of course, absolutely.

53:52.533 --> 53:55.556
That could have been me.

53:55.576 --> 53:56.036
For sure.

53:57.838 --> 54:00.941
But, you know, I didn't mind paying what I paid for it because it's worth it.

54:00.961 --> 54:02.722
That's right.

54:02.742 --> 54:04.744
We don't have one in Massachusetts.

54:04.764 --> 54:05.685
Are you kidding?

54:05.705 --> 54:05.945
No.

54:06.165 --> 54:08.587
No, Boston doesn't have one.

54:08.607 --> 54:09.548
And Aquarian Society.

54:09.728 --> 54:12.811
Actually, I think they were kind of in.

54:12.831 --> 54:17.115
Don't tell Mark that I know this, but I think they were in that at $240K anyway.

54:17.435 --> 54:19.097
Oh, sure, sure.

54:19.117 --> 54:19.677
That's right.

54:19.910 --> 54:20.491
Did you know that?

54:21.452 --> 54:22.433
They went to $140K?

54:22.574 --> 54:23.375
Yeah.

54:23.435 --> 54:25.538
No, he's kept that a secret.

54:25.618 --> 54:30.184
He wanted me to buy it for him.

54:30.224 --> 54:32.027
I know the fish to fry in the town.

54:32.047 --> 54:33.429
You're not going to put that in.

54:33.449 --> 54:33.949
That's right.

54:33.969 --> 54:35.371
You can leave it alone.

54:35.391 --> 54:36.833
In fact, I shouldn't.

54:36.853 --> 54:40.298
No, that's between you and I, so it's all.
