WEBVTT

00:03.625 --> 00:15.276
Okay, we're talking to Karen on my left, and Paula on my right, in the middle.

00:15.636 --> 00:16.717
This is the university library.

00:16.737 --> 00:18.759
It doesn't have a formal name, right, I guess?

00:18.779 --> 00:19.560
That's its formal name.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.482
It has no donor's name on the floor.

00:22.502 --> 00:23.463
If you know of one.

00:25.746 --> 00:27.968
Too late for Andrew Carnegie, I guess.

00:27.988 --> 00:31.151
Yeah, a little too late for Carnegie, yeah.

00:31.711 --> 00:32.772
Mark was famous.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.569
There's talk that this building might be replaced.

00:35.629 --> 00:37.050
I hope that's not the case.

00:37.070 --> 00:37.651
It's a beautiful building.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.253
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:39.273 --> 00:39.993
It renovated.

00:40.134 --> 00:41.055
Renovated would be nice.

00:41.936 --> 00:45.680
Reorganized in a way, because have you been on a tour of the building?

00:45.740 --> 00:46.961
No, that's right.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.084
Well, you'll get a tour of the building?

00:50.104 --> 00:52.747
We're going to go up to Rare Books and up to the fourth floor.

00:52.767 --> 00:52.867
Okay.

00:52.887 --> 00:57.352
Well, just seeing the fourth floor will give you an idea of why it needs to be rethought.

00:57.372 --> 01:00.295
There's little nooks and crannies and little classrooms.

01:00.836 --> 01:00.936
Yeah.

01:01.422 --> 01:05.086
The literature says that you have nine million books here?

01:05.206 --> 01:06.047
Nine million volumes, yeah.

01:06.067 --> 01:06.708
That's amazing.

01:06.728 --> 01:08.009
Yeah, yeah.

01:08.029 --> 01:11.072
In fact, I hope you can get it back in the stacks.

01:11.092 --> 01:12.053
We have time.

01:12.073 --> 01:18.500
We have a closed stack, and we also have a huge compact shelving facility, which is full to the brim.

01:18.820 --> 01:23.085
And we have remote storage areas just tucked all over the place.

01:23.105 --> 01:25.047
Did you have any outside storage?

01:25.067 --> 01:25.828
No, I wish we did.

01:25.888 --> 01:27.689
No, we desperately need it.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.151
It's really...

01:29.705 --> 01:31.448
But things are very packed in.

01:31.989 --> 01:32.951
Remote storage.

01:33.051 --> 01:36.918
This book, I hope, is going to have all of these phrases.

01:36.938 --> 01:37.780
Ah.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.747
And also in the electronic field, you know, migration and refreshing.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.332
Yes, in fact, I had my fill of all those.

01:44.432 --> 01:44.973
Emulation.

01:44.993 --> 01:46.235
Emulation is the new one.

01:47.337 --> 01:51.004
I just came back from the Coalition on Networked Information.

01:51.288 --> 01:54.778
conference, and you have all those words plus all those acronyms.

01:54.938 --> 01:58.949
Would you like to touch a book?

01:58.969 --> 01:59.190
Yes, yes.

01:59.210 --> 02:07.052
Even the acronym speakers get the acronyms mixed up, you know, so it's just a bunch of alphabets.

02:08.062 --> 02:12.026
And if you don't know what people are talking about, migration, you think you're talking about birds.

02:15.871 --> 02:16.832
But it's very interesting.

02:17.412 --> 02:18.333
I'm going out to L.A.

02:18.373 --> 02:20.876
again to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

02:20.896 --> 02:27.703
There's supposedly over a million reels of magnetic tape from the Viking mission.

02:28.424 --> 02:30.947
And 20% of it is unreadable now.

02:31.248 --> 02:35.652
Because magnetic taste is not a very reliable one.

02:36.052 --> 02:45.961
Well, apparently that's an area that you, when you go to these conferences, they're sort of hot topics, and apparently preservation of digital information is now rising to the top of the hot topic.

02:47.061 --> 02:55.308
In fact, the last session of this meeting was thrown together on short notice because the speaker who was supposed to come failed, got sick, and couldn't come.

02:55.869 --> 02:56.890
That was who?

02:57.390 --> 02:57.951
Ruffinburn?

02:58.051 --> 02:58.872
He seems to be there.

02:58.892 --> 02:59.692
No, no.

02:59.712 --> 03:00.613
He's quoted everywhere.

03:00.813 --> 03:01.794
I'd have to look.

03:01.834 --> 03:06.078
It was a woman, and she... And Kenny, it's a quail.

03:07.219 --> 03:08.701
I have her stuff, I'm sure.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.524
You see, it's just a big name.

03:11.684 --> 03:15.087
Well, I think it was mentioned in this thrown together panel.

03:16.028 --> 03:21.414
It was Cliff Lynch, who's the president of CNI now, put together this panel at the last minute.

03:22.795 --> 03:27.580
And some of the speakers, or one of the speakers, mentioned her.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.441
The person was supposed to come.

03:29.521 --> 03:34.366
She was going to talk on the holodeck and... Oh, the woman from MIT.

03:34.386 --> 03:36.067
Murray is her name, maybe?

03:36.267 --> 03:39.170
Yeah, she has a book called Hamlet on the Holodeck.

03:39.711 --> 03:39.851
Okay.

03:40.191 --> 03:43.194
That's probably it.

03:43.234 --> 03:46.056
She was heartbroken that she couldn't come.

03:46.076 --> 03:46.297
She's good.

03:46.497 --> 03:49.399
She really was very interested in talking about it.

03:49.419 --> 03:51.281
What was the name of that conference?

03:51.381 --> 03:51.661
Pardon me?

03:51.681 --> 03:53.743
What was the name of that conference?

03:53.823 --> 03:56.706
It's called The Coalition on Networked Information.

03:57.209 --> 04:00.712
And this was their spring task force meeting.

04:00.732 --> 04:04.296
Do they have a public relations person named there, just by chance?

04:04.356 --> 04:10.241
Joan Lippincott, I think, would be the person you'd want to talk to, who's the executive secretary or something like that.

04:10.261 --> 04:11.883
I can give you the title and all of that.

04:12.123 --> 04:13.164
His phone number would be good.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.668
Here, in fact, is the key contact.

04:16.688 --> 04:17.368
It's right here.

04:17.388 --> 04:17.689
Oh, great.

04:17.709 --> 04:17.849
Super.

04:17.929 --> 04:20.251
Associate Executive Staff Director.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.352
They have an email.

04:21.532 --> 04:22.393
Oh, that's even better.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.334
Clifford Lynch?

04:23.935 --> 04:24.415
Yeah.

04:25.137 --> 04:27.180
Clifford Lynch is quite a guru.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.623
I mean, he's a person who, you know, talks.

04:29.643 --> 04:31.746
He was here, in fact, not too long ago talking.

04:32.126 --> 04:33.588
A guru in what respect?

04:34.069 --> 04:47.227
Well, he's very, you know, well thought of and very... He strikes me as the sort of person who reads a great deal and is that kind of a pundit, you know, who sort of draws together a lot of ideas.

04:47.307 --> 04:49.710
And kind of conceptualizes the future, I think.

04:49.808 --> 04:54.274
Yeah, and it identifies the issues, the major issues.

04:54.475 --> 04:55.797
This is the one to get, I guess.

04:55.817 --> 04:59.983
Yeah, I think so.

05:00.543 --> 05:07.033
I can give you the Task Force membership list, I mean, any of the stuff that you want, any of the handouts that you want.

05:07.053 --> 05:09.697
I'll have them send me one of these kits, actually, and I'll call them.

05:10.398 --> 05:12.100
I'm sure they'll be happy to do that.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.562
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

05:13.582 --> 05:14.764
So, nine million books.

05:14.784 --> 05:19.731
I just did a piece for this good little magazine, which I write a monthly column for.

05:19.880 --> 05:27.094
the current one is the University of Toronto where they have 10 million books, but Toronto has what they call a dedicated budget for books.

05:27.114 --> 05:30.660
Do you have a dedicated budget for book acquisition?

05:30.680 --> 05:31.041
I don't know.

05:31.061 --> 05:31.462
I don't know.

05:31.642 --> 05:32.644
What do they mean by that?

05:32.744 --> 05:40.639
It means that regardless of how much money you might have to commit, say, to the acquisition of the electronic things, are you still going to guarantee yourself

05:40.923 --> 05:43.626
that you'll have enough money to buy the books that you need in a given year.

05:43.906 --> 05:47.170
Well, we never have enough money to buy the books we need.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.957
We don't sacrifice books for the sake of electronics, if that's what you need.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.220
I mean, we're not that far along with it, I wouldn't say.

05:55.240 --> 05:59.244
Well, but we don't have that kind of an official statement, I don't think.

05:59.985 --> 06:08.635
No, we're really, I mean, I think along with all the other research libraries, we're at the mercy of the marketplace a lot of times.

06:08.885 --> 06:15.215
huge number of journal subscriptions, and with that inflation, they're really hard-pressed intense.

06:15.235 --> 06:20.183
And journals have been going down dramatically over in recent years, haven't they?

06:20.203 --> 06:20.844
What, the cost?

06:21.885 --> 06:25.190
Well, the cost has been going up, but the subscriptions have been going down.

06:25.211 --> 06:26.352
You mean the number of out there?

06:26.372 --> 06:26.573
Yeah.

06:26.673 --> 06:35.787
Yeah, we've had to do lots of journal cancellations, and we're a heavy science school, agriculture, engineering, you know, chemistry, biology, that sort of thing, so they're very, very expensive.

06:36.425 --> 06:39.309
But that really is where the online area is good in the science.

06:39.329 --> 06:51.506
Yeah, that is where the electronic vendors, of course, are putting most of their information because they see a commercial market for them, whereas there is little commercial market in the humanities.

06:51.666 --> 07:00.799
But one of the interesting developments that was announced at this conference is that the NSF is now turning its attention to the humanities.

07:00.819 --> 07:02.702
They have kicked off...

07:03.070 --> 07:11.719
There's been a digital library initiative which has so far, I think, focused particularly on scientific technical information.

07:11.739 --> 07:18.786
And now they are opening it up to all kinds of subject areas in what, I think it's phase three of this.

07:18.866 --> 07:21.809
Again, there was a presentation on this at this meeting.

07:22.110 --> 07:27.916
And they're really encouraging the humanities to apply.

07:27.936 --> 07:31.980
And I went to another panel discussion in which,

07:32.888 --> 07:41.096
They tried to identify what were the unique... People always say, well, the humanities have huge information problems in relation to electronic information.

07:41.436 --> 07:45.580
And, you know, it's kind of one of these clichés that's bound to be found.

07:46.341 --> 07:56.631
And they were trying to get at, you know, what are these unique factors that make the humanities different from the sciences in terms of information representation and information retrieval.

07:57.392 --> 08:02.777
And that was kind of an interesting philosophical, quite abstract discussion

08:03.297 --> 08:09.303
that I listened to, and I wasn't entirely sure that I understood it all.

08:09.323 --> 08:33.068
But, I mean, it basically, what they think they were trying to say is that humanity's sources have layered into them, or the study of them has layered into it the perspective of the time in which they were created and the times in which they then are then reinterpreted, and none of these interpretations or views

08:33.352 --> 09:01.603
go away they're all still in the study of this object or this humanity source and they all have to be represented in some way there was another i thought very interesting discussion of this kind i mean another area that's really taking off is imaging the the representation of images and particularly a lot of cooperative projects dealing with museum images there was a metal project that was funded by getty

09:01.803 --> 09:16.108
and now there's this new one called Amico, and they were talking about the fact that, well, they showed a reproduction in electronic form of a mummy, and, you know, there are so many things to know about this mummy.

09:16.128 --> 09:26.005
You know, there's the person who is the mummy, then there's the mummy case itself, which is an artwork, then there's the

09:26.238 --> 09:28.944
the study of Egyptology in relation to the mummy.

09:29.044 --> 09:31.951
There's the study of medicine in relation to mummification.

09:31.971 --> 09:32.973
No, there's a CD?

09:33.735 --> 09:39.387
No, this is just talking about how if you put this image in an online database, you have to have

09:39.738 --> 10:04.147
some kind of what they keep calling metadata, which is another one of these words like emulation, metadata, you have to have some, and a cataloger could obviously speak to this, you have to have some information that leads someone who's looking to the, you have to have pointers that lead someone who is looking for, say, the medical aspects of this mummy to this particular mummy.

10:04.167 --> 10:08.412
I mean, I don't know how true it is that you would meet a medical person

10:08.729 --> 10:14.139
would have to know about this specific mummy if they were studying mummifaction, but you know, you could get the general idea.

10:14.640 --> 10:26.101
So you have to have some pointers that take you to this part of the information about this object, and then you have to have other pointers which take you to the information about the jewelry the mummy is wearing.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.505
Basically what footnotes used to do for us in books, maybe.

10:28.725 --> 10:31.851
Yeah, to some extent I guess that's true.

10:32.067 --> 10:47.586
Anyway, I guess the woman who is the executive director, maybe, of this project was saying that they had accumulated 75 files of detailed information about the mummy.

10:47.686 --> 10:48.709
What was the name of the project?

10:48.976 --> 10:51.419
This is called the Amico Project.

10:51.519 --> 10:52.020
A-M-I-C-A.

10:52.320 --> 10:52.740
Yeah.

10:53.061 --> 10:56.164
And again, if you want information on that, I have a bunch of .

10:56.184 --> 10:57.966
It's going to have a chance to meet with Beth Sandor.

10:57.986 --> 10:58.307
Oh, okay.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.270
And she's going to show him the project she's working on.

11:01.290 --> 11:04.374
Well, I mean, electronic stuff is terrific.

11:04.394 --> 11:09.400
And the thing it does, Broward does magnificently, you know.

11:10.121 --> 11:13.144
I mean, the OED is never going to be printed again, you know.

11:13.546 --> 11:22.055
Do you think that the Encyclopedia Britannica, they belong online where the information is constantly being kept?

11:22.616 --> 11:37.512
You'll find that these very arcane monographs and professional books that cost a fortune to buy and only sell an edition of 300 copies, why shouldn't they be published on

11:37.745 --> 11:43.493
What an interesting thing that occurred here.

11:44.254 --> 12:05.322
We went to journal cancellations in the last year, and you know, you have a notion that scientists in particular are going to be very, very warmly receive electronic materials, but you know, they really, the chemists on this campus, for example, wanted no part of the notion that they might not have the hard copy

12:05.572 --> 12:07.555
of journals and whatever.

12:07.755 --> 12:08.656
Okay.

12:09.117 --> 12:13.703
And have the potential of either getting full text electronically or document delivery.

12:14.023 --> 12:15.606
That was not okay.

12:15.626 --> 12:18.990
And they were very vehement and very clear about that.

12:19.010 --> 12:20.252
Did they carry the date?

12:20.272 --> 12:20.752
Oh, indeed.

12:22.194 --> 12:25.299
They got the campus to give us money to restore most of our journals.

12:26.100 --> 12:33.790
Well, you know, there's another level of that, which is even more astonishing, and that is that we subscribe to

12:34.343 --> 12:39.450
The Science Citation Index online, and there's a very strong feeling, and that's an index.

12:39.470 --> 12:46.720
You know, that's something that you would think they would want online, and the value added of having it online was so great that they would be willing to get that.

12:46.740 --> 12:47.942
What is it called Science?

12:47.982 --> 12:48.863
Science Citation Index.

12:49.944 --> 12:52.948
And it's a massive index.

12:53.249 --> 13:00.439
It's very complex, and we had to cancel the print copy in order to pay for this, because it's quite expensive.

13:00.459 --> 13:02.882
How much is it just at a curiosity?

13:03.267 --> 13:11.775
Well, we purchased, this is the Institute of Scientific Information, ISI, publishes three such indexes.

13:11.795 --> 13:15.399
One is science, one is social science, and one is humanities.

13:16.460 --> 13:21.945
And we bought them through a consortial arrangement with ISI.

13:23.247 --> 13:31.395
And so they all came together in one product, which ISI is calling the Web of Science, a very unfortunate name.

13:32.035 --> 13:32.616
Sure is.

13:32.630 --> 13:39.739
Again, I'd have to look up the exact number for you, and it is a consortial bargain.

13:40.359 --> 13:46.427
But I think we're paying something like $50,000 a year for that set of indexes.

13:46.447 --> 13:51.693
So we had $25,000 or so sunk in the print versions of SANE.

13:52.835 --> 13:55.077
And $50,000 for the electronic?

13:55.097 --> 13:56.539
Versions per year.

13:56.639 --> 13:57.661
I see.

13:57.681 --> 13:59.683
And let me just ask a quick question.

14:00.068 --> 14:01.530
50,000 a year.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.733
Now, what if you decide not to take it next year?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.475
You've paid for access to this stuff.

14:05.495 --> 14:06.777
Do you lose access to it?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.880
Is that 50,000 going?

14:08.900 --> 14:23.460
In the case of ISI, we negotiated, or CIC, the consortium that we're a part of, which is the Big Ten Library, negotiated that we would actually own that data so that if we do cancel that particular subscription,

14:23.862 --> 14:27.846
we could take that data and put it up on our local system.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.528
So you could keep what you've already paid for it.

14:29.608 --> 14:32.090
In that case, yes, but that is a real issue.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.292
And we are getting this over the web.

14:34.933 --> 14:43.782
So I'm not quite sure how that would in truth work, you know, whether they would, whether we would actually be able to get this data.

14:44.343 --> 14:51.810
And it wouldn't be as much use to, I mean, you know, if you subscribe to something electronically for a year and then you have one year's worth of a file,

14:52.060 --> 14:53.822
It isn't of much use to you.

14:53.842 --> 14:55.424
I suppose.

14:55.484 --> 14:56.865
It's like having a run of serials.

14:56.905 --> 15:01.149
Well, I mean, a run of serials is different, but you'd have to go.

15:01.170 --> 15:09.078
It would be very, eventually that data would simply not be used because people would be, well, it depends on what you replace it with.

15:09.098 --> 15:17.967
There is no replacement for this particular index, so the only reason to cancel is if you want to go back to the print.

15:18.301 --> 15:21.827
And so what you'd have is people... But I'm saying, what if that decision were to be made?

15:21.847 --> 15:22.829
I mean, it's a small part.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.390
I'm just curious.

15:23.711 --> 15:25.574
Well, we think about that kind of thing.

15:25.674 --> 15:36.655
No, but what I'm doing is reinforcing your point in that even if you owned that electronic data, eventually, or very soon, it would become useless because it would be just one isolated year and no one would look at it.

15:37.576 --> 15:39.941
It's so service-oriented.

15:39.961 --> 15:42.385
I mean, you want people to go all over the place for stuff.

15:42.635 --> 15:43.336
So what happened?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.960
You canceled the print, and did you have an opinion to it?

15:45.980 --> 15:55.134
Well, there is a certain amount of negative feedback from, especially chemistry, I believe, about canceling the print of Science Citation Index.

15:56.275 --> 15:58.699
That's where it was housed, so they would finish it.

15:58.719 --> 15:59.680
Oh, that's right, yeah.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.241
So what happened?

16:00.622 --> 16:03.746
Well, I don't think that's been resolved yet, actually.

16:03.766 --> 16:06.270
I think that's waiting to get attention.

16:07.432 --> 16:10.937
We truly don't have the money.

16:12.689 --> 16:15.753
Do you do deaccession books?

16:15.773 --> 16:16.714
Occasionally.

16:16.734 --> 16:17.775
Do you have a policy on that?

16:17.795 --> 16:18.215
We do, yeah.

16:18.256 --> 16:26.245
We have a regular withdrawal policy, and, of course, we're a state institution, so it's rather bureaucratic withdrawal policy.

16:26.585 --> 16:31.111
These books are actually property of the state.

16:32.652 --> 16:42.544
But at the University of Michigan, other, you know, half a solo, in fact, I was talking to this fellow Don Riggs, who's since left, and he was talking about a policy.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.756
I don't know if they ever implemented it.

16:44.776 --> 16:46.078
I'm going to have to find out.

16:46.098 --> 16:46.738
I'm curious.

16:46.799 --> 16:51.965
But if a book hadn't been withdrawn within five years, it was circulated.

16:52.005 --> 16:52.867
Oh, no.

16:52.907 --> 16:54.248
I can't believe that.

16:55.250 --> 16:55.810
Michigan?

16:56.071 --> 16:56.451
Michigan.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.714
The new library isn't even called a library.

16:58.794 --> 17:03.000
I mean, it's student information, something.

17:03.080 --> 17:03.340
I don't know.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.722
Oh, we would never do that.

17:04.862 --> 17:05.783
No, we would never do that.

17:05.824 --> 17:12.312
And in fact, we just had some real breast-beating conversations in a collection meeting about...

17:12.646 --> 17:39.143
about whether or not we could afford with our with our storage situation to keep more than one copy of the book you know i mean people want to keep as many copies and they don't care you know if we have ten copies of your book and they all look exactly the same people have very strong feelings so they keep all kind of really yeah yeah i can almost understand that you know um yeah oh yeah it's just that you know when you have nobody's using

17:39.494 --> 17:45.560
Yeah, it's really, people feel very, very strongly.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.944
I thought we were a very collection-oriented group of people here.

17:48.964 --> 18:02.078
Yeah, we are a very collection-oriented library, and it's, I think, partly, and this was advanced for the reason for this outcry on the part of the science faculty, was that the university was founded out here in the middle of cornfield.

18:02.378 --> 18:08.725
And, you know, the idea of having a great library here to attract scholars was, you know, sort of,

18:09.008 --> 18:11.130
part of the mythology at this point.

18:11.371 --> 18:11.991
From the beginning?

18:12.072 --> 18:13.794
From the beginning, absolutely.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.958
And, you know, there's a story about President, can I tell this story correctly?

18:17.978 --> 18:18.459
I don't know.

18:18.479 --> 18:24.986
President James, who, you know, went and got so and so many dollars and bought a hundred books.

18:25.006 --> 18:26.108
Oh, that's right, yeah, yeah.

18:26.128 --> 18:28.410
Yeah, that's all in our... Is this something I can get?

18:28.731 --> 18:30.973
Yeah, you can get... It's the kind of thing I've used, by the way.

18:31.274 --> 18:34.177
Yeah, you can use... It's my kind of anecdote, and I love these stories.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.720
Because, really, what does occasion

18:37.679 --> 18:40.543
the placement of nine million books in the middle of the country.

18:40.563 --> 18:44.649
Oh, no, this is the vision of the first president of the university.

18:44.889 --> 18:49.756
He realized that in all this day, there's a whole story about why the university got cited here in the middle of the state.

18:49.776 --> 18:51.999
I mean, there's a big political competition and everything.

18:52.620 --> 18:57.107
But he recognized that you couldn't have a university in a place like this without a great library.

18:57.127 --> 18:59.350
Right, because we are so isolated.

18:59.690 --> 19:00.992
We're not close to Chicago.

19:01.032 --> 19:04.257
I mean, a hundred years ago, we weren't close to Chicago or St.

19:04.297 --> 19:07.281
Louis or any of the other centers like that.

19:08.071 --> 19:11.560
Well, that story can be easily provided.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.606
Is there anything written on it?

19:13.626 --> 19:15.270
Well, I'm thinking, what's his face?

19:15.290 --> 19:19.060
He's doing the history of the university.

19:19.512 --> 19:23.435
Oh, it's probably in his book, Wynton Fulberg.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.756
Wynton Fulberg.

19:25.397 --> 19:26.838
We might even pass him in the hall.

19:26.858 --> 19:29.280
He might actually pass it.

19:29.621 --> 19:38.929
He is now S-O-L-B-E-R-G, and his first name is Wynton, and the history of the university is in the reference department.

19:39.149 --> 19:42.672
I'm sure we probably have 10 copies of it in the stacks, too.

19:42.712 --> 19:43.913
Oh, I'm sure we did.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.154
It was published.

19:45.214 --> 19:48.777
It was published, I'm sure, by the university, perhaps, quite a while ago.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.868
It's only the first, he's working on the second volume.

19:52.269 --> 19:56.073
It was only the first so-and-so many years of the history.

19:56.093 --> 19:56.213
I see.

19:56.674 --> 20:01.019
It was mentioned last night that you had a, was it a president or a librarian who bought so many books?

20:01.219 --> 20:02.240
A librarian.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.302
Dean Downs, probably.

20:04.402 --> 20:04.543
Yeah.

20:04.563 --> 20:05.063
Robert Downs.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.405
You see his portrait hanging out.

20:06.425 --> 20:06.785
Robert Downs.

20:06.825 --> 20:07.426
Yeah.

20:07.606 --> 20:11.570
His attitude was, in fact, a lot of it wasn't even catalogued.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.032
He put it in a rearing?

20:13.052 --> 20:14.153
That was a new word.

20:14.754 --> 20:16.536
Cataloguing a rearing, yeah.

20:16.837 --> 20:21.944
Yeah, it was just a Kellyanne backlog, yeah, which probably continues to this day.

20:22.004 --> 20:22.545
I don't know.

20:23.025 --> 20:25.889
He must have really been acquiring a frenetic case.

20:26.149 --> 20:27.351
Oh, going to Europe.

20:27.772 --> 20:39.267
I remember Mariana Tolden talking one time about some of the people who come from the Soviet Union and how many books we had actually saved from

20:39.820 --> 20:43.912
pre-World War II destruction, and they're just sitting in our stocks.

20:44.454 --> 20:47.062
I'm having a chapter on emigre collections.

20:47.082 --> 20:48.265
That's very interesting to me.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.936
This is our Saudi collection, in fact, is one of the premier collections.

20:52.016 --> 20:53.982
He acquired this, this library?

20:54.130 --> 20:58.376
Well, I think just getting immigrants coming here and, you know, scholarly people coming here.

20:58.396 --> 20:59.818
I think you'd want to be careful.

20:59.838 --> 21:02.182
You need to talk to Mariana about it.

21:02.202 --> 21:04.525
The Slavik Collection has its own special history.

21:04.545 --> 21:06.087
Yeah, the Slavik Collection.

21:06.108 --> 21:06.368
Mariana?

21:06.488 --> 21:08.291
Mariana Cholden was right next door here.

21:08.651 --> 21:14.580
It was part of the C-H-O-L-D-I-N, Mariana Tax, Cholden.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.481
You know, get the tax.

21:15.501 --> 21:16.182
Tax?

21:16.202 --> 21:17.404
Yeah, it's called tax.

21:17.705 --> 21:22.636
He's the famous sociologist, I understand.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.219
How did he spell tax?

21:24.339 --> 21:25.181
As in tax.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.669
As in yesterday, right?

21:28.709 --> 21:34.321
There was a lot of state departments for the Slavic Library and the Cold War.

21:35.343 --> 21:37.688
This is material that was acquired during the Soviet period?

21:38.292 --> 21:42.016
Is it pre-revolutionary stuff, or is it... In many cases.

21:42.476 --> 21:43.858
Yeah, I would say so.

21:44.038 --> 21:57.111
But again, I think we're... Yeah, I think you should ask, Marianna, if you're interested, but my impression is that some of the really fine stuff that we have were just sort of personal libraries, you know, that so many people fleeing Europe.

21:57.131 --> 21:57.972
So how did they get here?

21:58.412 --> 22:07.962
Well, I mean, places... I worked at Ohio State for a while, and, you know, sat there cataloging next to a man who was a judge in Latvia, and, you know, I mean, people just...

22:08.296 --> 22:14.162
came to the Midwest and found new lives and, you know, a lot of them were very learned.

22:14.522 --> 22:17.725
Well, this area has a huge Eastern European population.

22:17.745 --> 22:18.286
Indeed, yeah.

22:18.306 --> 22:18.686
Exactly.

22:18.706 --> 22:19.527
It does, of course.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.250
It's a lot of family.

22:22.270 --> 22:29.617
Well, another factor in the building of this library that shouldn't be ignored was the faculty in New World.

22:30.317 --> 22:38.185
There are legendary faculty who built collections here.

22:38.840 --> 22:58.705
their own collections which they then gave to the university well that happens too but in the great collection building days they were building them for the university by going on buying trips and but they were given the money and the and the authorization and the mandate to go do it that's really exciting yeah yeah that's really quite common is this stuff that i'll be able to get

22:59.039 --> 22:59.480
Oh, yeah.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.121
It's great stuff.

23:00.141 --> 23:00.802
I mean, I've used it.

23:00.822 --> 23:02.825
This is precisely the kind of stuff.

23:02.845 --> 23:05.369
That particular kind of thing isn't unique to Illinois.

23:05.389 --> 23:09.937
I mean, I think you would find that in all of the great... It is, but you have to find stories.

23:09.977 --> 23:10.898
Yeah, yeah.

23:10.918 --> 23:15.245
Oh, yeah, in the library histories, you'd find all sorts of things about that.

23:15.265 --> 23:16.207
I'll do a little work for you.

23:16.227 --> 23:17.128
Well, that'd be great.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.472
Send you some bibliography or something.

23:19.552 --> 23:20.514
I'm writing right now.

23:20.534 --> 23:24.220
I'm having a...this whole...this new book is...I'm looking for a...

23:24.841 --> 23:27.744
a phrase to describe what it is, but it's this book culture.

23:28.125 --> 23:36.434
And, of course, they add the arrival of the electronic stuff, but I've been to all the new national libraries, the new British and the new French.

23:36.474 --> 23:41.280
We haven't even talked about preservation much ado for brittle books and stuff.

23:41.300 --> 23:48.688
You know, there's so many wonderful, the thing about this collection is that it truly has an enormous number of

23:49.445 --> 24:04.509
quite rare books that in many collections might be in a special collection of some kind, and they're just sitting in our stacks because we don't have the facility or the, you know, just the procedures or the money to care for them.

24:04.529 --> 24:07.373
I'm surprised you don't build an off-site storage thing.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.076
Well, we keep talking about it.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.381
It was almost a reality.

24:12.665 --> 24:21.996
My dream now is to try to get some of the other state libraries to just go and build a huge tower in a cornfield and let us all take a part in it, you know.

24:22.016 --> 24:24.158
Well, just put one up in an apple orchard.

24:24.178 --> 24:25.079
Yeah, yeah.

24:25.099 --> 24:25.660
I mean, you know.

24:25.940 --> 24:32.087
Harvard, this chapter I'm starting in the Harvard Depository, where they have already six of these.

24:32.107 --> 24:33.769
Oh, yeah, that must be fascinating.

24:33.789 --> 24:37.634
And that's now the Harvard model, which is something I'm selling it on.

24:37.654 --> 24:38.254
And so on.

24:38.274 --> 24:40.958
And this is a facility that will hold 20 million books.

24:41.238 --> 24:41.338
Yeah.

24:41.723 --> 24:51.000
So I'm starting there, and then the guy takes me through, and then I go with Ken Carpenter at Harvard, and we go through the Widener stacks, and we're picking books to go up to the department.

24:51.020 --> 24:51.941
This is a big deal.

24:52.021 --> 24:54.306
I mean, he said, I really take this so seriously.

24:54.366 --> 24:54.987
Oh, absolutely.

24:55.027 --> 24:58.433
I'm really influencing the way scholarship is going to be.

24:58.533 --> 24:58.934
That's right.

24:58.974 --> 25:06.347
If you take a book out of immediate circulation, and he mentioned, I don't want to talk to myself, I'm going to be quick.

25:08.183 --> 25:11.747
There's a whole thing when you, I'm an ex-cataloger.

25:11.767 --> 25:15.731
That might even make a good chapter title, you know.

25:15.751 --> 25:16.732
Oh, it's nice.

25:17.033 --> 25:17.433
Yeah.

25:17.453 --> 25:34.191
There's this whole idea when, I'm an ex-cataloger, and you think about this idea of concatenation, and how books fall together on a shelf, and, you know, the meaning of putting a certain call number on a book, and the influence of how people use it, because of serendipity.

25:34.728 --> 25:43.197
I totally maintain that in this book, the most exciting books I found were never the ones I went into the Widener Stacks to get.

25:43.357 --> 25:43.958
Absolutely, absolutely.

25:44.399 --> 25:55.310
I would go in, you know, you do your search, and you go in with your list, and then you go in and you'd be sitting there, and all of a sudden, you know, your eye would go over here, and this is the one that's really exciting.

25:55.330 --> 25:56.932
This is the one with the good stuff.

25:56.952 --> 25:58.053
You've never heard of this book before.

25:58.073 --> 25:59.455
You didn't know it existed.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.377
And it happens time and time and time again.

26:01.677 --> 26:29.828
Well, I was going to tell my research story about, and it really revolves more around convenience, because I've done research in the past on the influence of women on the foundation of public libraries in the United States, and we have in this library, it so happens, probably the most extensive collection of state library commission reports dating way back to the beginning of the 20th century.

26:30.145 --> 26:32.808
and also public library annual reports.

26:33.549 --> 26:47.164
So when I was doing this research, all I would have to do would be to go to 021 point whatever the call number, I don't remember quite now, the next two digits for state libraries or history of states in relation to libraries.

26:47.765 --> 26:51.048
And I could just go from shelf to shelf and find all these commission reports.

26:51.088 --> 26:58.216
And then as far as the public library annual reports were, I mean, they were all just under the call number and then organized alphabetically.

26:58.276 --> 26:59.798
So I wanted to see if we had

26:59.980 --> 27:06.550
San Antonio Public Library report, I'd just go to his call number and look under S, and there would be, or would not be.

27:07.571 --> 27:09.954
I mean, I found amazing things that way.

27:10.315 --> 27:16.023
And it's a stunning collection for somebody who happens to be doing research in this area.

27:16.043 --> 27:16.985
And, you know, who would know?

27:17.065 --> 27:18.647
I mean, that's the kind of thing where

27:18.931 --> 27:23.577
People would go into the stacks to weed things, and they'd say, public library annual reports.

27:23.598 --> 27:24.759
Who would ever use these?

27:24.779 --> 27:25.160
Oh, yeah.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.281
Oh, yeah.

27:26.301 --> 27:27.403
Well, what are they useful for?

27:28.024 --> 27:39.860
Well, for me, they were useful in actually tracing the history of how these libraries had been founded by women, and in this particular article I was writing, which I was trying to— Is this published?

27:39.880 --> 27:39.980
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.341
Uh-huh.

27:40.421 --> 27:42.424
I have two articles on this subject.

27:42.444 --> 27:44.567
Could I get the citations for them?

27:44.787 --> 27:47.571
I'd give you copies if you want.

27:48.125 --> 27:48.766
Where was I?

27:48.926 --> 27:59.256
Oh, the second article I was writing was I was trying to demonstrate how often women were involved in the Carnegie Library grant to obtain a public library in their city.

28:00.257 --> 28:07.424
And so I had to, I knew what the Carnegie libraries were, and so it was easy then to go again to the shelves and see what I could find.

28:07.464 --> 28:09.226
I wrote a particular one that I was looking for, too.

28:09.246 --> 28:11.869
I mean, where I knew there was an interesting story.

28:12.609 --> 28:16.393
And so I found, you know, a lot of,

28:16.424 --> 28:23.173
details for these interesting anecdotal stories by going to these annual reports.

28:23.253 --> 28:26.577
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're getting close at the time.

28:26.597 --> 28:27.719
This is too good.

28:27.799 --> 28:28.119
I know.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.782
You can stay here and we can push everything back.

28:31.483 --> 28:33.045
What's up next?

28:33.266 --> 28:34.587
Barbara Jones in the Red Book Room.

28:34.607 --> 28:38.092
Oh, you'll definitely have to talk to Barbara.

28:38.112 --> 28:39.053
Can we have five more minutes?

28:39.073 --> 28:39.794
Absolutely.

28:39.814 --> 28:43.859
You make sure that Barbara shows you the Milton collection.

28:43.959 --> 28:45.942
I'll do that before.

28:46.883 --> 28:50.048
Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm not carrying this away in great time.

28:50.069 --> 28:57.441
But once again, explain how you do organize the catalog things to reinforce this whole concept of serendipity.

28:58.082 --> 29:04.393
Oh, it's just the idea of concatenation, that you put call numbers on books and they fall together.

29:04.794 --> 29:07.098
How do you work on making the selection?

29:07.879 --> 29:09.963
Well, it's the judgment calls, really.

29:09.983 --> 29:11.085
I mean, you have to...

29:12.280 --> 29:17.888
You look at the subjects, you think about how they interrelate, and you look at all the other subjects that you own.

29:18.048 --> 29:26.320
I remember somebody saying to me once that when you have a very small collection, one book becomes very, very important.

29:26.521 --> 29:37.156
So if you're in a very small public library, you have a book on birth control, it better be a really damn fine book because it really fills the whole area of birth control.

29:37.196 --> 29:39.840
But in a library like this, you get a book on birth control,

29:40.006 --> 29:47.396
You could stick it with women's history, you could stick it with medicine, you could stick it with social issues, you know, and you have to think about who's going to use it the most.

29:48.157 --> 29:49.458
Yeah, that's a little tricky.

29:49.478 --> 29:51.421
Yeah.

29:51.641 --> 30:00.693
Barbara mentioned last night, we had dinner last night, but you just got this grant to build a Jewish Hebrew or Yiddish collection.

30:00.833 --> 30:01.514
Oh, yeah.

30:01.534 --> 30:07.161
Well, we have one, actually, and I used to be the Jewish Studies bibliographer and not as a sort of

30:08.035 --> 30:17.351
tag on to my other jobs, and I've been very grateful to give it to people like Barbara Jones, who are much more scholarly and knowledgeable about Jewish studies than I am.

30:17.531 --> 30:27.107
But we have an absolutely unbelievable Yiddish and Jewish Studies collection that you would never guess, because we don't have a program here, but somebody had given us a

30:27.273 --> 30:33.182
a strong collection of Yiddish books, and now we've had a huge... These are books that you had, apparently?

30:33.242 --> 30:56.115
We've already got them, and then a couple came along and gave our university and University of Illinois in Chicago a huge, huge endowment in Jewish studies, and some of that money can go to the library, and we have endowed chairs, and say, like, we have one in Yiddish literature, and we discovered in bringing the candidates in, and they were taking them through what we already own, and he...

30:56.534 --> 30:59.578
You know, this man is saying, oh, it's a wonderful, wonderful collection here.

30:59.618 --> 31:00.499
It's not cataloged.

31:00.519 --> 31:02.001
It's down in our sub-basement.

31:04.023 --> 31:08.729
This is kind of material that was acquired by this librarian, apparently.

31:08.769 --> 31:10.311
This is material that was here.

31:10.592 --> 31:21.485
Well, a lot of the Yiddish stuff was, the Yiddish literature that we have was given to us through some connections from a bookstore up in Chicago.

31:23.168 --> 31:25.090
Oh, no, in the last...

31:25.306 --> 31:27.289
Do you remember the name of the bookstore?

31:27.949 --> 31:29.932
No, no, no, I don't.

31:30.012 --> 31:32.315
It may have even been Chicago Public, Natalie.

31:32.495 --> 31:36.220
Maybe the bookstore bought it from Chicago Public and then gave it back to the store.

31:36.801 --> 31:44.331
See, people think that books are not going to matter that much anymore, but stature really does derive from your collection, doesn't it?

31:44.451 --> 31:45.873
Oh, it does, and it's magnetic, too.

31:45.893 --> 31:47.415
And numbers matter, too.

31:47.435 --> 31:52.782
There's a sort of magnetism, so you get one little collection of books, and then suddenly, you know, it's like they're

31:53.048 --> 31:55.231
They find a home.

31:55.251 --> 32:03.803
It's like when you get one cat, they send out the words, it's an okay place to be, and suddenly you have seven cats.

32:03.823 --> 32:06.266
I want to tell you a little story before you leave.

32:06.286 --> 32:09.330
It has to do with you, actually.

32:09.390 --> 32:12.214
You wrote an article in Civilization.

32:12.434 --> 32:13.396
Anne-Marie.

32:13.416 --> 32:14.297
Anne-Marie.

32:15.425 --> 32:16.386
No mistakes, I hope.

32:16.606 --> 32:28.982
I was telling the story of this article at a reception for the provost who was leaving, and I was telling the story to Jack Zillinger and Nina Boehm.

32:29.562 --> 32:37.332
Jack Zillinger is a Keith scholar, and Nina Boehm is an American literature, American fiction, women's history

32:37.835 --> 32:52.689
And I said I read this wonderful article about Sendak and how he didn't feel that he was almost worthy of reading Shakespeare and reading Keats, but that eventually he had this depression.

32:52.729 --> 32:54.451
I think that's what you said.

32:54.471 --> 32:55.452
That's exactly right.

32:55.472 --> 33:04.180
And that he had decided that there was a way to get out of that and to read these authors that he had sort of saved for himself in a way.

33:04.312 --> 33:10.742
So I was telling this story to Jack because I thought being a well-known Keats scholar, he would think this was very interesting.

33:10.842 --> 33:19.095
So then his wife said, well, and you know, he called Jack when he started his reading of Keats.

33:19.116 --> 33:30.133
And Jack, who was a very wonderful person and probably would never have told this story himself, said, yes, it was so amazing to talk to this marvelously intelligent and wonderful man.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.689
who was asking me questions like a high school kid.

33:33.709 --> 33:34.892
You want me to trump that story?

33:35.332 --> 33:39.420
When I was there, I told him, I said, gee, I'm doing an interview with Helen Bedlick.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.945
He said, can you put me in touch with Helen Bedlick?

33:43.007 --> 33:44.610
And I said, well, I'll ask you.

33:44.951 --> 33:45.672
I'm sure I can.

33:45.692 --> 33:50.200
And I said, Dr. Bedlick, I'd like to give you a call to talk about Keith.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.645
He said, you want to talk to me about Keith?

33:52.945 --> 34:19.678
she said i'd love to i don't know what happened i gave him her phone number i'm sure he contacted her well i don't know how he got i'm curious to know and i didn't ask them probably the same way he got helen's number somebody probably told him he does he does pick but he's going to be in my new book i'm going to have a chapter on readers um maurice sundack umberto echo i just did a piece on him for bibliography tilly olson who i met out in san francisco you know tilly olson

34:19.878 --> 34:21.220
She was 85 years old.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.161
She wrote Silences.

34:22.622 --> 34:22.862
Oh, right.

34:23.003 --> 34:23.944
Totally self-taught.

34:23.964 --> 34:25.286
Never graduated from high school.

34:25.386 --> 34:28.571
Brilliant, you know, writer.

34:28.591 --> 34:31.054
Her books totally read to death.

34:32.497 --> 34:34.059
And she's just a very, very interesting story.

34:34.079 --> 34:38.746
I wanted to see her about the San Francisco Library because she was one of the great supporters.

34:38.766 --> 34:45.135
And then all of a sudden the collections are disappearing and going off to the... It's going to be a fun book.

34:45.436 --> 34:45.976
Oh, yeah.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.559
What's your timetable for that?

34:47.579 --> 34:48.400
It's pretty soon.

34:48.768 --> 34:51.071
I mean, they want it, but I hope she wants it.

34:51.091 --> 34:57.199
We're talking to Barbara Jones on my left, and Lynn Fores, you pronounce it, Fores?

34:58.120 --> 34:58.260
Mm-hmm.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.043
Let me just ask Lynn briefly, how old are you, Lynn?

35:00.063 --> 35:00.623
I'm 23.

35:00.643 --> 35:01.825
I'll be 24 in October.

35:01.845 --> 35:03.467
Okay, and you're from Worcester, Massachusetts?

35:03.487 --> 35:03.727
I am.

35:04.829 --> 35:06.491
And where did you go to undergraduate?

35:06.651 --> 35:08.213
I did my undergraduate at Smith College.

35:08.413 --> 35:09.655
I graduated in 1996.

35:10.136 --> 35:11.477
And what did you study there?

35:11.497 --> 35:15.002
I was a double major in comparative literature and French literature.

35:15.583 --> 35:15.923
And...

35:16.325 --> 35:18.489
You're here because you want to be a librarian, is that right?

35:18.790 --> 35:19.591
Yes, that's right.

35:19.611 --> 35:30.452
I got a job in the rare book room at Smith's as part of my work study, and that was when I started handling rare books, and I got addicted.

35:30.652 --> 35:31.914
It's like an urge now.

35:33.697 --> 35:34.918
Was Michelle there at the time?

35:35.079 --> 35:36.120
She was not, actually.

35:36.301 --> 35:41.649
I started working under Karen Coquille, and Ruth Mortimer was still alive, but she was ill at the time.

35:41.829 --> 35:44.012
So I only saw her very, very briefly.

35:44.032 --> 35:44.994
I didn't really know her there well.

35:45.094 --> 35:46.296
The legendary Ruth Mortimer.

35:46.917 --> 35:49.681
It was under her influence, but I didn't actually see her much.

35:49.781 --> 35:55.630
And then Michelle came my senior year, so actually it was really fun because meeting Michelle was great, and

35:55.947 --> 36:11.101
I ended up sort of showing her the ropes in terms of finding her way around the collection, and I did the tours that year for the undergrads and other people who came in because she didn't really have as much of a grasp on what we had in terms of pulling out the high pieces and things to impress people, stuff like that.

36:11.121 --> 36:13.564
And Martin Antonetti is there now.

36:13.584 --> 36:14.424
That's right.

36:14.444 --> 36:15.085
Very interesting.

36:15.105 --> 36:18.568
I mean, here we are approaching the year 2000.

36:18.869 --> 36:21.791
Do you really think there's a future in this point of work?

36:21.851 --> 36:23.613
Oh, I hope so, because otherwise I'm in trouble.

36:24.794 --> 36:25.735
That's a great quote.

36:26.339 --> 36:32.228
Do you hope to work on an institutional level in special collections or what?

36:32.248 --> 36:37.756
My goal when I grow up is to be Barbara or to be Michelle in the sense of to be a curator in a rare book library.

36:38.377 --> 36:45.227
I need to do a couple more degrees before that really happens and get a whole lot more experience, but that's my eventual goal.

36:47.070 --> 36:51.477
What I love is working with these amazing pieces of history.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.321
There's just nothing that quite replicates

36:54.571 --> 36:56.935
the feeling of holding a 16th century book in your hand.

36:57.375 --> 37:02.363
It's just the most amazing sensation, or even earlier, you know.

37:03.104 --> 37:07.531
It's wonderful that the young people to be so enthusiastic about books.

37:07.691 --> 37:08.312
I love what I do.

37:09.013 --> 37:10.295
It makes me so incredibly happy.

37:10.376 --> 37:12.038
Now, are you a collector of books?

37:12.058 --> 37:13.480
And you don't have to be.

37:13.541 --> 37:14.161
I wish I were.

37:14.262 --> 37:15.964
I'm a vicarious collector.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.166
I don't have the money to collect yet.

37:17.186 --> 37:17.727
But you collect

37:18.112 --> 37:20.698
I collect textbooks.

37:21.159 --> 37:23.404
Most librarians really aren't.

37:23.985 --> 37:28.114
They get their satisfaction handling the stuff.

37:28.274 --> 37:29.216
I can't afford to collect.

37:29.277 --> 37:30.138
I wish I could.

37:30.158 --> 37:33.606
I have lots of things I would love to own.

37:33.873 --> 37:37.258
Well, would you say it was your experience at Smith then that got you interested in this?

37:37.398 --> 37:37.939
I think so.

37:38.179 --> 37:49.536
I grew up using, you know, the public libraries in Worcester, and I had lots of great librarians at our little branch, and I was always encouraged to read as a child, and so I've been a book lover since God only knows Glenn.

37:50.036 --> 37:58.509
But I think that getting the job at Smith in the Rare Book Library, which, you know, when I applied for it, I was like, gee, this looks like a neat room.

37:58.549 --> 37:59.811
It might be a cool place to work.

38:00.191 --> 38:01.132
I guess I'll try for it.

38:01.173 --> 38:02.114
You know, I like poetry.

38:02.134 --> 38:02.975
They've got poets here.

38:03.276 --> 38:03.576
Sure.

38:03.978 --> 38:04.599
kind of thing.

38:04.939 --> 38:07.563
It was really random, but it was the best thing that happened to me.

38:07.743 --> 38:11.188
It was really just an amazing experience working with primary materials.

38:12.310 --> 38:17.417
Just completely changed my life, my view of literature, you know, changed everything.

38:18.158 --> 38:20.801
And now I'm just consumed by it.

38:20.821 --> 38:21.282
It's great.

38:21.322 --> 38:22.724
I do manuscript processing now.

38:22.824 --> 38:24.366
I get to read people's mail for a living.

38:24.707 --> 38:27.150
It's wonderful.

38:28.548 --> 38:32.692
Just prior to graduation, you decided you were going to go to library school, right?

38:32.712 --> 38:33.033
Really?

38:33.113 --> 38:33.713
Yeah.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.536
What happened was... So what was the short list of schools?

38:37.177 --> 38:48.148
Well, my jump into library school was kind of a strange one because when I was finishing up at Smith, I applied to PhD programs in comparative literature thinking that I'd be a professor.

38:48.348 --> 38:50.710
And I got rejected by five of the best programs in the country.

38:51.551 --> 38:57.357
And I still have their rejection letters just in case I ever decide to try again so that I can, you know, see if it works and, you know,

38:57.809 --> 39:00.672
Just remember that I've been rejected by five of the best.

39:01.993 --> 39:03.194
Rejection builds character.

39:03.214 --> 39:03.815
Yes, it does.

39:04.055 --> 39:07.499
And I had the wall of shame outside my dorm room so that everyone could see the rejection letters.

39:07.559 --> 39:08.320
It was very amusing.

39:09.020 --> 39:13.505
And at that point, I sat down with Michelle and I said, what am I going to do with my life?

39:14.726 --> 39:15.567
I need to do something.

39:15.607 --> 39:16.508
I need to support myself.

39:16.548 --> 39:17.069
And she looked at me.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.090
She said, what about library school?

39:18.110 --> 39:20.632
And I went, huh, I never thought of that.

39:21.593 --> 39:26.398
And so at that point, she encouraged me to apply to UCLA, where she teaches.

39:26.682 --> 39:40.805
And I got in, but I was too late to get federal aid, to get financial aid or funding or anything like that, and since my parents can't help me, you know, this is entirely me funding myself through school, I didn't go, even though I got accepted.

39:40.825 --> 39:53.365
I decided to wait a year, and I applied for jobs, and the job at the library company came up, and through many wonderful things, I got it, and decided to work for a while and see if I could

39:53.902 --> 39:56.005
Were you selling the books at the library company?

39:56.165 --> 39:57.507
I was not selling the books.

39:57.707 --> 39:59.209
I was sitting at the table for a little while, yes.

39:59.229 --> 40:00.731
I'm everywhere.

40:01.932 --> 40:02.894
I'm just going to follow you.

40:03.695 --> 40:04.616
That's fine.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.157
You're good luck.

40:06.338 --> 40:11.825
But I went to the library company, and I worked there for about a year, and then I decided to try again for library school.

40:12.166 --> 40:17.953
And my Urbana Choice was, again, influenced by Michelle, because I said, Michelle, you know, I don't really want to move all the way to California.

40:17.973 --> 40:19.656
She's like, well, what about, you know, Illinois?

40:19.676 --> 40:20.837
And I said, huh.

40:20.857 --> 40:22.339
She said, it's the best program in the country.

40:22.859 --> 40:24.041
You know, it's number one right now.

40:24.621 --> 40:26.965
And I said, hmm, that's something to take into consideration.

40:27.065 --> 40:30.189
And so what makes it the best program?

40:30.209 --> 40:31.291
Do you want the honest answer?

40:31.871 --> 40:38.921
The honest answer is that it's the number one program, as far as I understand it, by default, because Columbia closed and the University of Chicago closed.

40:40.683 --> 40:42.165
That's as far as I understand it.

40:42.626 --> 40:46.912
In terms of being a rare book person, it's no better or no worse than any other program.

40:46.952 --> 40:49.896
I could have essentially gone anywhere as long as I could get an assistantship in

40:50.315 --> 40:54.240
rare books, but the fact that I had a really good chance of doing so here was a big factor.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.202
That and the assistantship paid my tuition.

40:56.703 --> 40:58.985
It's really, really kind of shameful, isn't it, Columbia?

41:00.307 --> 41:00.447
Mm-hmm.

41:00.467 --> 41:02.529
You know, Dewey and this, this, this, this stuff.

41:02.549 --> 41:03.190
That's where I went.

41:03.210 --> 41:03.691
That's where I went.

41:03.951 --> 41:04.051
Yeah.

41:04.071 --> 41:06.995
Well, the problem is that... Where I went, I was a very religious program.

41:07.455 --> 41:08.837
Library schools don't make any money.

41:08.857 --> 41:12.701
I mean, librarians, on the whole, who own traditional librarianship, don't make any money.

41:12.721 --> 41:14.484
That's why Columbia basically closed the family.

41:14.504 --> 41:14.884
That's right.

41:14.904 --> 41:15.765
Because the alums weren't rich.

41:15.897 --> 41:41.196
exactly no rich alums means that's exactly what i asked terry why absolutely no money i said that's not supposed to make decisions on the basis of that are you excuse me but that's what happens alums don't make any money so they don't give any and the people who are in the information science end of things now who are making money um if they're in the corporate librarianship end of things they tend to sort of look at this as a necessary hoop but really a waste of their time it's just a piece of paper

41:41.497 --> 42:07.757
um and then they don't want to give any money to this program either but so even though these other two it's by default but still what makes you better than what you say is stronger than the others probably the assistantships um most people who are admitted are guaranteed at least a quarter time of assistantship and the assistantship comes down to professional experience which is what you need for a library job the mls is a piece of paper unfortunately at this point it's not really well considered even by people within the field to be an important degree it's

42:07.940 --> 42:18.511
Everyone that I've talked to is sort of like well it's a hoop you need to jump through and that's a shame because it is a year of schooling and it could be made a lot more academic, a lot more intensive and a lot more useful.

42:18.591 --> 42:22.975
Right now it's sort of a practical degree that gives you the jargon that you already knew but you need the piece of paper.

42:24.557 --> 42:31.304
The assistantships here though provide real professional experience and when you're applying for jobs that's what you need because that's what they're going to look at.

42:31.324 --> 42:37.710
They want the accredited piece of paper but they want the job experience more than anything and the more experience you have the better chance you have of getting a job.

42:38.180 --> 42:43.985
to be able to do an assistantship in libraries like this one is just too good of an opportunity to pass out.

42:44.025 --> 42:45.066
Well, how many left are there?

42:45.106 --> 42:47.528
Wisconsin still has a legitimate library school.

42:47.869 --> 42:48.910
I don't know how many of them.

42:48.930 --> 42:56.176
Wisconsin, Drexel, UT Austin, UCLA, Pittsburgh has a library school, don't they?

42:56.196 --> 42:58.038
Rosary College, yeah, Pittsburgh's got it.

42:58.058 --> 42:58.959
How about Simmons?

42:58.999 --> 43:00.680
Simmons does have a library school.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.962
In Chicago, but it's called something else now.

43:02.982 --> 43:05.284
It's now Dominican University.

43:05.304 --> 43:05.905
Yeah.

43:05.925 --> 43:06.385
Rutgers.

43:06.505 --> 43:07.326
Rutgers.

43:07.930 --> 43:08.230
St.

43:08.270 --> 43:09.451
John's in New York?

43:09.471 --> 43:12.314
There's a school in Atlanta called Clark, I believe.

43:12.334 --> 43:12.774
Okay.

43:12.934 --> 43:16.037
There's about 20 programs that are still available.

43:17.578 --> 43:18.579
But they are getting smaller.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.381
Yeah, the cachet's not there anymore.

43:20.421 --> 43:22.783
I mean, when Columbia closed, that was like, you know.

43:23.323 --> 43:24.344
I feel good.

43:24.364 --> 43:24.745
Yeah.

43:25.806 --> 43:30.370
The person, Bob Wedgeworth, who was at Columbia, is the director here.

43:30.410 --> 43:32.491
Oh, good.

43:32.551 --> 43:33.552
I wanted you.

43:33.772 --> 43:34.133
Good.

43:34.153 --> 43:37.836
So you did meet Bob, because he's very interesting.

43:38.457 --> 43:46.087
Because he was basically brought in to close down the school at Columbia, and a lot of people saw him as the savior.

43:46.188 --> 43:50.333
And in fact, they had, my opinion is, they had made the decision when he went there.

43:50.353 --> 43:52.616
So it was really not his fault that it closed.

43:52.637 --> 43:53.157
That's a shame.

43:53.177 --> 43:53.798
It's still a shame.

43:53.838 --> 43:57.363
He was brought in to smooth it for everybody.

43:57.383 --> 43:58.064
That's too good.

43:58.324 --> 43:59.005
Yeah.

43:59.025 --> 44:00.507
He's a very diplomatic person.

44:01.909 --> 44:08.278
Barbara, who's the gentleman that said, Rachel, I suppose he's the one in 93, had U of I listed second to the...

44:08.596 --> 44:13.664
University of Chicago, and then Chicago closed, and as she said, by default, we became number one.

44:13.744 --> 44:19.993
It's a fairly well-known name, but I can't, it begins to be on the tip of my tongue.

44:20.854 --> 44:21.916
He just does sort of a rating.

44:22.337 --> 44:23.218
It's a rating.

44:23.278 --> 44:36.578
I can't remember the name, but it's... Then there was a follow-up survey a few years later of actual librarians, and they found that based upon responses of alums of various different library schools, that the U of I was considered

44:36.845 --> 44:38.808
So, this is a rating?

44:38.888 --> 44:39.930
Is it published?

44:39.990 --> 44:40.490
Yes.

44:40.510 --> 44:42.573
It's published, and I can't remember that man's name.

44:42.834 --> 44:46.479
It begins with a B. If you think of it, would you?

44:46.539 --> 44:48.202
It's probably over in Library Science.

44:48.222 --> 44:48.482
Oh, yes.

44:48.502 --> 44:49.584
You can find it in Library Science.

44:49.644 --> 44:51.326
I'm quite sure.

44:51.727 --> 44:55.172
I don't quite know how many of you use all this, but it's very interesting.

44:55.833 --> 44:58.397
If you're really exploring this concept of book culture.

44:58.477 --> 45:00.099
Yeah.

45:00.199 --> 45:05.367
Well, in my opinion, when Terry's program closed down at Columbia, that was a major blow because

45:05.802 --> 45:08.064
That program was very special.

45:08.385 --> 45:14.191
We, gee, I learned he would not only, it wasn't just the academic work he did, which was rigorous.

45:14.251 --> 45:17.054
Terry was extremely rigorous.

45:17.594 --> 45:21.419
And, oh, like we had to memorize Carter, ABCs of book collecting.

45:21.439 --> 45:25.443
I mean, we had to get 100% on that test before we could pass the course.

45:25.703 --> 45:27.925
And we had to do collation.

45:28.366 --> 45:29.447
Yeah, I know.

45:29.630 --> 45:32.273
But everything is touch, everything is hands-on.

45:32.333 --> 45:32.653
Right.

45:32.673 --> 45:36.477
And he just moved his whole book, I expressed, to Charlottesville.

45:36.497 --> 45:38.159
He did, and it's fun in Charlottesville.

45:38.179 --> 45:40.181
I love to be down there, and it's a really neat thing.

45:40.201 --> 45:40.862
I could even live there.

45:41.022 --> 45:41.743
Oh, yeah.

45:41.763 --> 45:42.223
I could, too.

45:43.164 --> 45:43.685
Really nice.

45:43.745 --> 45:47.449
Terry talks about retirement down there, and he gives us all retirement literature.

45:48.009 --> 45:51.973
And Terry's right now trying to figure out what's going to happen to his program when he retires.

45:52.073 --> 45:57.499
And it's sad to me that he has to worry about that, because he's the only game in town.

45:57.599 --> 45:58.540
Now, we tried to...

45:59.650 --> 46:26.637
i tried to talk to the dean of the library school here about setting something up but distance learning just doesn't do it you have to touch the book and then i talked to university of alabama where they have a center for the book art and i talked to a woman in the library school there who used to work here and she said we have the program but you have the book so i said to marcella well let's see what can we do and i was trying to figure out a way that

46:26.988 --> 46:30.032
Every summer, I could fly books down there and accompany the books.

46:30.532 --> 46:32.154
That's how bad things are.

46:32.254 --> 46:33.976
We've got the books here, but no program.

46:33.996 --> 46:36.239
She's got the program, but no rare books at Alabama.

46:36.479 --> 46:38.942
And Terry's program had it all.

46:39.783 --> 46:43.267
And within an academic institution.

46:43.287 --> 46:44.969
Yeah, and it's a specimen collection.

46:46.531 --> 46:48.413
It's a lot of different things.

46:48.973 --> 46:51.316
Right, so it was a really special thing.

46:51.917 --> 46:54.520
A lot of us were really happy that we were in it.

46:54.540 --> 46:56.522
Because the other thing is, in New York, you can do things like,

46:56.873 --> 46:59.897
He would say, okay, you can take calligraphy downtown with Lily Longley.

46:59.937 --> 47:02.420
So I took a calligraphy class on my off days.

47:02.440 --> 47:05.504
I took Japanese papermaking with Tim Barrett when he was in town.

47:06.666 --> 47:11.232
When the Twin Rocker paper people were in from Indiana, I worked with them.

47:11.252 --> 47:12.293
I worked with Roger Hammity.

47:12.553 --> 47:14.636
Terry would have people moving in and out.

47:15.217 --> 47:18.501
In Charlottesville, you don't have that kind of movement that you have in New York City.

47:18.521 --> 47:20.544
Or to go to the auction houses.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.067
Or to go see Lucienne Goldschmidt.

47:23.485 --> 47:26.910
Or to go to the Schimmel's townhouse to look at the show.

47:26.930 --> 47:27.771
That's pretty good.

47:27.791 --> 47:29.073
You know, that was the experience.

47:29.113 --> 47:30.835
It was nine very intensive months.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.517
Plus, we could get money, too.

47:32.577 --> 47:37.664
Terry would call us and say, they need somebody to work at the auction house for an afternoon.

47:37.725 --> 47:38.606
It's 35 bucks.

47:38.626 --> 47:40.188
And then that would be our weekend money.

47:40.268 --> 47:42.691
So there were no assistantships.

47:42.711 --> 47:46.757
But my internship was at the Cooper Hewitt Museum Library.

47:46.937 --> 47:51.163
So, you know, I just feel like that's a really lost opportunity.

47:51.953 --> 48:03.853
The library school here, Lynn, you probably should address this instead of me, but it's almost as if one has to make a choice, or at least that's the way it appears to me, as to whether you're going to be a techie or you're going to be a

48:04.154 --> 48:04.916
A book person.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.078
Very much so.

48:06.238 --> 48:11.469
What I found so far in the program is that... So they have programs for both, I get it.

48:11.489 --> 48:22.652
It's supposed to be one program, and they really harp... Dean Esserbrook is very big on trying to close the great divide between information science and librarianship, but the way that the courses are set up, there really still is a big gap.

48:22.672 --> 48:24.897
Either you're taking things like reference and cataloging,

48:25.366 --> 48:32.019
and bibliography, or you're taking systems analysis, programming courses, things like that.

48:32.380 --> 48:45.906
And the thing is that there isn't, as far as I understand it, a course, say, for librarians on how to understand systems in terms of this is how a system is set up, this is how you take apart a CPU, this is how you

48:46.460 --> 48:50.205
this is how you put together a system, this is how you load software, that sort of thing.

48:50.425 --> 49:04.522
There isn't a basics course, a computer basics for librarians so that you can understand, A, you can do sort of minor troubleshooting on your own, and B, you can understand when it's time to call the systems person and what they're telling you when they explain to you what's happened.

49:05.163 --> 49:06.745
There really isn't a course that covers that.

49:06.765 --> 49:13.193
So what happens is you sort of have to learn it on the fly, either through workshops, which are offered by the graduate assistants in the computer lab,

49:13.612 --> 49:14.152
on your own.

49:14.193 --> 49:19.377
I mean, I've learned sort of, I've learned database design and maintenance here because we've needed databases to create finding aids.

49:19.577 --> 49:28.565
And since I've used Microsoft Access vaguely before, I've just sort of fucked until I figured it out and there's really no instruction otherwise.

49:28.886 --> 49:31.468
And unfortunately, that's really what is happening.

49:31.508 --> 49:42.538
And for the people who are in the library related courses, there are so few of them now because it's so heavily weighted towards information science and we have so many computer scientists on the library school faculty that

49:42.974 --> 49:44.876
It's hard to get courses.

49:45.978 --> 49:53.947
People only teach one section of things, so that I'm taking Arts and Humanities reference, for instance, this semester, which for a reference librarian is a pretty important thing to have.

49:54.007 --> 49:55.749
There's only one section of it.

49:55.810 --> 50:02.558
They only had 25 people in the section, and 80 or 100 people wanted to get in.

50:02.698 --> 50:04.100
This may not be offered for another year.

50:04.600 --> 50:10.247
Illinois also really pushes the fact that you can finish this program in a year, but if you can't get the courses you want, what's the point?

50:11.003 --> 50:15.467
So there is a real divide in terms of information science and library science.

50:16.668 --> 50:35.744
And I think it's a shame because I think that especially the way that technology is moving into the library so rapidly, it's really important for the traditional librarians to have a grasp on what's going on and to not be technophobic and to be able to deal with computers as part of their daily lives and to be able to just kind of move from that perspective.

50:35.764 --> 50:40.808
And I also think it's important for the information scientists to see the library end of things.

50:41.243 --> 50:52.058
to see where the library part fits in to what they do, because I think that often that isn't there either, that you're going to get computer scientists who don't see library applications to what they do.

50:52.298 --> 50:59.548
Well, as a practical matter, looking for a job really would help you to have proficiency in the stuff.

50:59.748 --> 51:00.189
Exactly.

51:00.429 --> 51:07.839
I mean, most of the jobs that I've seen advertised, they want things like encoded archival description, SGML, HTML skills.

51:07.899 --> 51:10.002
I don't have all of that, and it's

51:10.235 --> 51:38.014
and if you're not a computer science the problem right now is we have cf people who are doing the info science end of things who are qualified for a lot of the library jobs but don't want them and then you have librarians who aren't doing the cf kind of stuff who have all the other skills but not the computer stuff and want the jobs but can't get them because they don't have the computer so where are the jobs today um where are they in terms of numbers in terms of places in terms of places i just applied for

51:38.450 --> 51:41.836
a position at Brown and a position at Wesleyan in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

51:43.038 --> 51:43.799
They're all over the place.

51:43.899 --> 51:44.701
I watch Ex Libris.

51:44.721 --> 51:48.327
That's really where I look for jobs because I'm so specialized in special collections and rare books.

51:49.128 --> 51:53.195
So that's my main source of looking for jobs is Ex Libris.

51:53.536 --> 51:54.738
There's lots of academic positions.

51:54.798 --> 51:58.705
I think that the most growth is happening in the Southwest, I think.

51:59.306 --> 52:00.909
Well, they're actually opening new colleges.

52:01.009 --> 52:01.690
Yeah.

52:02.176 --> 52:03.478
That's very interesting.

52:03.498 --> 52:05.481
How do they build their collections from scratch?

52:05.642 --> 52:06.263
Yeah, exactly.

52:06.724 --> 52:12.734
We were talking last night about this Jewish Hebrew program that you're starting.

52:12.754 --> 52:12.974
Right.

52:13.074 --> 52:14.897
And when is that going on?

52:14.917 --> 52:17.201
Are there any press releases on that you think that I could get?

52:17.221 --> 52:17.401
Sure.

52:17.421 --> 52:20.647
Oh, I can get all the material on the Drobne gift.

52:21.228 --> 52:23.411
If I don't have it in my office, I'll send it.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.213
Okay.

52:24.653 --> 52:28.099
Yeah, it's really an exciting thing to start from scratch.

52:28.484 --> 52:37.254
As I was saying last night, the funny thing to me is that a library of this caliber actually has the material we discovered, even the Yiddish material.

52:37.514 --> 52:38.676
It had never been unpacked.

52:38.696 --> 52:39.797
It's still in its boxes.

52:39.817 --> 52:42.180
Where physically, where was it?

52:42.440 --> 52:44.222
It's still in the sub-basement.

52:44.242 --> 52:44.803
Well, I don't know.

52:44.823 --> 52:51.991
It may be moved now because we're cataloging, but it was when I took Rabbi Newman down there, it was in the sub-basement of this building.

52:52.632 --> 52:53.533
This building?

52:53.613 --> 52:54.434
Yes.

52:55.295 --> 52:55.555
Right.

52:55.872 --> 52:57.716
How did you know it was there?

52:57.816 --> 53:01.684
Actually, one of the maintenance people, one of the guys who's worked here.

53:01.944 --> 53:02.986
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:03.006 --> 53:03.808
And what did he tell you?

53:03.828 --> 53:05.511
What did the person tell you?

53:05.531 --> 53:08.377
Oh, he said, oh, yeah, it's down there on that.

53:08.397 --> 53:13.086
Because a lot of these guys really love working here, and they... How did the conversation start, I wonder?

53:13.106 --> 53:13.948
I mean...

53:14.840 --> 53:38.620
well we went back you should see our stats you should see what nine million volumes looks like you really should see it it gives i still get goosebumps when i walk in there because the smell the um just the look of that many books um but anyway i'd like to do that yeah oh yeah well we should do that well maybe we should maybe i should go to carly

53:38.887 --> 53:42.273
and maybe we should cancel the Cole Proust archive.

53:42.353 --> 53:44.236
What is the archive?

53:44.256 --> 53:53.773
It's an archive of the personal correspondence of Marcel Proust, and it was collected for basically the entire 20th century by a member of the faculty here.

53:53.956 --> 53:59.602
and it's being digitized and so it will be available on the web.

53:59.862 --> 54:01.564
It's an interesting project.

54:01.724 --> 54:03.786
We have to be with Beth at 11 o'clock.

54:03.927 --> 54:14.858
We just wanted to make sure that we could show you that we're trying to bridge the gap using electronics for something like Colt Cruz or for our emblem book project or for Cyber Shakespeare.

54:15.218 --> 54:21.465
And in addition to having the books, I don't think there has to be an either or.

54:21.563 --> 54:25.307
Why can't we just get more of both, you know?

54:25.507 --> 54:26.849
I mean, why not?

54:27.029 --> 54:28.370
Ask the people who provide the funding.

54:28.470 --> 54:30.913
Yeah, it's an economic question.

54:31.073 --> 54:33.556
Well, that was one of my questions this morning.

54:33.576 --> 54:36.919
It's an economic question.

54:36.939 --> 54:41.424
I just told her that I thought it was beautiful, and I could sit there all day and almost be in tears and just stare.

54:41.745 --> 54:49.613
It's so, I don't know, it's just amazing for someone who loves something that much to get to see, like, the real thing.

54:49.981 --> 54:54.212
What's your name?

54:54.232 --> 54:54.733
Amanda.

54:54.753 --> 54:58.262
And you're a freshman, sophomore?

54:58.302 --> 54:59.465
Freshman.

54:59.485 --> 55:00.227
Coming in from where?

55:00.247 --> 55:01.330
From Illinois?

55:02.453 --> 55:03.636
Yes, from Chicago.

55:04.088 --> 55:07.613
Is this the first time you've ever seen what could be called a rare book?

55:07.633 --> 55:07.813
Yes, sir.

55:07.833 --> 55:09.996
And what you saw, was it Shakespeare stuff?

55:10.677 --> 55:13.420
It was the first portfolio.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.742
Oh, yeah.

55:14.822 --> 55:15.823
Well, that's quite a treat.

55:17.786 --> 55:20.750
I will tell you, you have a new privilege.

55:20.810 --> 55:21.431
That's quite nice.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.493
That's great.

55:24.535 --> 55:28.560
I see a Barry Mosier huck finn over there.

55:28.793 --> 55:35.426
Our Library Friends program last Tuesday was on Mark Twain and his relationship to his publishers.

55:35.446 --> 55:37.189
And so we pulled a few things.

55:37.289 --> 55:43.020
And then the other exhibit was Spanish devotional literature, and that was put together by a graduate seminar.

55:43.080 --> 55:47.629
We let graduate seminar students put in exhibitions if they wanted.

55:47.997 --> 55:52.684
Barbara, do you have any literature, publications, any special collections?

55:52.704 --> 55:57.812
Anything that just... Nothing too updated, but I would be happy to pull together what we have.

55:58.293 --> 55:59.775
That's something from 1950.

55:59.935 --> 56:00.436
That's fine.

56:00.756 --> 56:03.160
Anything anecdotal?

56:03.300 --> 56:03.661
Sure.

56:03.681 --> 56:07.927
We had a little story this morning about the founder of the university.

56:07.947 --> 56:14.137
I mean, how is it that you have such an enormous library in the middle of these countries?

56:14.197 --> 56:15.699
Right.

56:15.879 --> 56:16.300
Yeah, yeah.

56:16.482 --> 56:17.863
I could go on and on about that.

56:17.883 --> 56:26.092
I'm from the Midwest, and I just think, I mean, farmers in their tractors are listening to the radio or listening to books on tape.

56:26.212 --> 56:31.197
It's a very, Iowa has the highest literacy rate in the country, I think, or it used to.

56:31.218 --> 56:32.739
I mean, people out here read.

56:32.799 --> 56:34.281
They've always read.

56:34.381 --> 56:42.169
And to have books on your shelf in the living room was a sign that you had made it beyond just being a farmer.

56:42.605 --> 56:50.617
It was a real... You know, I won't go on and on about that, but it's a real... Well, you can go on and on.

56:50.637 --> 56:54.162
Well, no, I mean, I wouldn't... Scholarly-wise, I mean, I've never measured it.

56:54.202 --> 57:00.731
I just know that I grew up out here, and I know that everybody reads and always has, no matter what your job was.

57:01.212 --> 57:05.558
I grew up in farm country in Iowa, and everybody read, and it was...

57:05.943 --> 57:10.268
a source of great pride to have books on your shoes, even if you couldn't afford a new couch.

57:10.448 --> 57:19.118
You know, there's one of the most amazing book cities I've ever been in, and I don't yet know how I'm going to put it in this new book, but Cleveland, for instance.

57:19.138 --> 57:19.478
Oh, really?

57:19.558 --> 57:24.163
You know, they have a wonderful public library, and they have very impressive collectors.

57:24.223 --> 57:28.068
They have an institutional library, very interesting.

57:29.169 --> 57:32.052
It's kind of the thing you're talking about, though.

57:32.622 --> 57:33.964
Almost a sacred object.

57:34.184 --> 57:35.005
Yeah, it is.

57:35.266 --> 57:46.260
I grew up with the Iowa Public Library System, and the freedom to read statement that we base all our First Amendment work on, and the American Library Association was written at the Des Moines Public Library during McCarthyism.

57:47.922 --> 57:48.683
No, I'm not.

57:49.485 --> 57:52.869
It's a very strong reading community still.

57:52.889 --> 57:54.071
Is that something that's published?

57:54.792 --> 57:55.012
Yes.

57:55.172 --> 57:55.813
Oh, yeah.

57:55.833 --> 57:56.494
Can I get it?

57:56.514 --> 57:57.155
Oh, sure.

57:57.175 --> 57:57.956
What do you call it again?

57:58.156 --> 57:59.558
The freedom to read statement.

58:00.280 --> 58:07.489
And it came out of Des Moines Public Library in the 50s as a response to McCarthy.

58:08.390 --> 58:10.192
It's one of the first things that my other school students see.

58:11.114 --> 58:11.674
Thank goodness.

58:11.774 --> 58:17.442
That's something else I would like to, I mean, I've spent, my professional specialty is the First Amendment.

58:17.602 --> 58:28.195
And when you get a program where people are learning specialties like HTML or whatever, it's too easy to forget the big picture being that we're really here,

58:28.715 --> 58:32.199
to provide access in a very activist way, in my opinion.

58:32.219 --> 58:39.386
I mean, we are here to provide all points of view, whatever people want, without any kind of censorship.

58:39.406 --> 58:43.631
And fortunately, our library directors feel strongly about that here, but a lot of them don't.

58:44.232 --> 58:49.798
A lot of them are coming out of the whole management paradigm now, sort of Dilbert's thing.

58:51.099 --> 58:52.701
So you went to the Columbia program?

58:53.061 --> 58:53.862
And when were you there?

58:54.263 --> 58:59.268
I was there in, I was there in 77 and 78.

58:59.448 --> 59:02.251
I worked at the university.

59:02.311 --> 59:03.412
Cincinnati's a good example.

59:03.772 --> 59:09.938
The city of Cincinnati is a great book town, and it's, well, it's not exactly in the middle of the country, but it's, you know.

59:09.958 --> 59:16.504
And I worked at the Cincinnati library, at the university library, and across the street is Hebrew Union College, which is a great library.

59:16.524 --> 59:20.428
And downtown, the public library was chartered as a research library.

59:20.448 --> 59:24.051
Plus, there were a couple of private, there were Mercantile libraries.

59:24.385 --> 59:27.209
So yeah, and then I went into Terry's program.

59:27.289 --> 59:29.473
So you studied under Terry?

59:29.593 --> 59:32.037
Yeah, and decided to go into their books.

59:32.678 --> 59:36.063
Went into, got snookered into library management.

59:36.163 --> 59:41.731
I was a library director in three different institutions, and was miserable, and decided to go back into their books.

59:41.751 --> 59:42.472
You're from Des Moines?

59:43.113 --> 59:49.724
I grew up in Iowa, Des Moines and in Washington, Iowa, actually, a really small farm town, and very smart.

59:49.744 --> 59:52.688
Stephen Blumberg just went on trial again two weeks ago.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.654
Has that been NX Lubris, by the way?

59:55.674 --> 59:56.215
I think it has been.

59:56.235 --> 59:57.957
Yeah, they keep up the conviction.

59:58.438 --> 59:59.700
I don't think they put up the conviction.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.962
They put up that he got caught again.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:04.808
And they, of course, had a big sounding when he got out of jail the first time.

01:00:04.988 --> 01:00:07.372
Oh, yeah, but I mean, he was... That's right, the Atomal Connection.

01:00:07.412 --> 01:00:08.734
I'm talking about Iowa and literacy.

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:13.041
It's kind of funny.

01:00:13.061 --> 01:00:13.321
Yeah.

01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:15.444
Numbers and special corrections?

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:21.814
We have about 500,000 volumes and then about 700 cubic feet of manuscript.

01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:22.692
700?

01:00:23.293 --> 01:00:23.734
Yeah.

01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:25.879
And then we have... Linear.

01:00:25.899 --> 01:00:26.300
Cubic.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.002
Cubic.

01:00:27.022 --> 01:00:27.303
Cubic.

01:00:30.129 --> 01:00:32.174
And our big collections are proofed.

01:00:33.337 --> 01:00:36.545
It's the largest after the Biblioteque National.

01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:36.765
Wow.
