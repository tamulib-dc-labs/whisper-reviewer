WEBVTT

00:05.313 --> 00:12.004
We did an award from the concrete society.

00:12.064 --> 00:16.171
Well, it's reconstituted stone.

00:16.271 --> 00:18.455
I like that.

00:18.735 --> 00:23.203
I like that.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.308
This is quite magnificent.

00:26.710 --> 00:47.015
I just really love how you didn't attempt to replicate a 17th century room.

00:47.996 --> 00:50.078
Well, it's all down to the architecture.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.041
It works perfectly, it does.

00:52.441 --> 00:54.244
They did listen to us about most things.

00:54.264 --> 00:55.485
There were a couple of things that we...

00:55.651 --> 00:57.454
We were overruled on.

00:57.534 --> 01:01.940
The design of the actual rooms is all left to them.

01:03.883 --> 01:08.490
What would you estimate the dimensions of this room?

01:08.950 --> 01:10.873
No, I can't estimate.

01:10.893 --> 01:15.680
I can give you the... But I'm thankful for estimating anything.

01:16.061 --> 01:18.604
Well, I know the... Let me see.

01:18.765 --> 01:20.427
Are they 9 foot wide or 9 foot high?

01:20.980 --> 01:24.106
They're about 9 high easily.

01:24.887 --> 01:28.253
I'd say about 25 feet that way and I'd say about 20.

01:28.273 --> 01:32.461
33 feet across there.

01:32.481 --> 01:35.787
33, okay.

01:35.807 --> 01:37.891
Probably like 50, that would be my guess.

01:38.893 --> 01:43.461
I'd be quite a guess.

01:44.487 --> 01:56.872
You can spot the ones with the paper, like that one, because it's obviously so much whiter.

01:56.892 --> 02:00.138
So there are one or two paper ones.

02:00.599 --> 02:06.090
Obviously there are many of the manuscripts in the 17th century.

02:06.070 --> 02:20.431
We've managed to get a couple of the chart lists done in the same style by the same and they're all accurately based on the old catalogues, but obviously all left to go.

02:20.472 --> 02:25.439
But we have only one, early on surviving, even so it's no earlier than 18th century.

02:25.960 --> 02:33.371
But it's gotten to be in too decrepit a state to... Excuse me one moment.

02:33.591 --> 02:35.554
Can I just...

02:43.381 --> 02:44.983
escape with that book.

02:46.585 --> 02:49.509
So, this is my meaning.

02:49.529 --> 02:53.935
I've got to edit these things and get them done and I'm not getting through the fastness.

02:53.955 --> 02:57.981
So we've only got the two break at the moment with the reputations list, but obviously they would all have had them.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.985
And the letters, as I said, are just 18th century.

03:01.906 --> 03:04.710
Before that, they were numbered.

03:05.271 --> 03:07.093
There were a couple of

03:07.073 --> 03:09.420
Labels like that, that is sexta, meaning six.

03:09.741 --> 03:12.750
Count it from the top, one, two, three, four, five, six.

03:12.890 --> 03:19.109
And the top is secunda, meaning, that was the earliest way, the 17th century way of identifying the shelves.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.977
So they were number one, two, three, four, five, six, et cetera.

03:22.227 --> 03:24.390
on the north side and the same on the south side.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.677
In the 18th century they replaced that with letters.

03:28.797 --> 03:38.431
And the labels above, I think these ones are probably eighties too, but they're certainly based on the earlier ones, getting the actual subject.

03:42.918 --> 03:49.568
What is that little symbol, that little design between the... Just the decoration.

03:49.717 --> 04:04.231
It's one side of the Bay and the other, you see, so it's civil and civil history on that side and scholasticism.

04:04.471 --> 04:05.292
That's wonderful.

04:06.473 --> 04:09.696
I know you're visiting, so actually, if we could just look a little bit.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.036
Fine.

04:10.157 --> 04:11.398
I thought I'd probably do that.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.520
Let's come back, too, because you can do all your things.

04:14.501 --> 04:15.882
Sure.

04:15.902 --> 04:16.523
That's wonderful.

04:16.943 --> 04:19.065
Thank you.

04:23.281 --> 04:26.286
What's your name, sir?

04:26.306 --> 04:26.686
Yes, sir?

04:27.628 --> 04:29.250
Doug Cox.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.674
I'm only a volunteer.

04:32.616 --> 04:46.858
I thought you'd be interested, because if you look at them, that in every language, Hebrew, Latin, Arabic, Welsh, that's Spanish, Greek, Latin, English...

04:47.648 --> 04:48.690
Hebrew.

04:49.051 --> 04:50.134
And these are very early.

04:50.154 --> 04:52.479
And these are printed books, right?

04:52.539 --> 04:55.166
These are printed books, round about the 1500s, 15-1600s.

04:55.186 --> 05:02.222
But, I mean, that one is interesting because that was the first translation into Welsh.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.129
So that's on shelf three, at number four.

05:05.169 --> 05:06.552
It's the...

05:06.835 --> 05:12.082
On the top shelf there, on the left, and it supports the red front.

05:12.262 --> 05:13.404
I see, yes, all right.

05:13.424 --> 05:16.728
And that's 1567, that is the first translation.

05:16.769 --> 05:17.810
And which press is this?

05:17.830 --> 05:18.771
How do we identify this?

05:18.791 --> 05:23.257
This is A. Press A. Press A. Shelf 3.

05:24.539 --> 05:25.400
Shelf 3.

05:25.761 --> 05:26.562
Book number 4.

05:26.582 --> 05:28.585
In that room, that's not in the book.

05:29.045 --> 05:29.786
Arabic 3.

05:30.387 --> 05:31.769
In book 4, Roman numeral.

05:32.069 --> 05:32.590
That's right.

05:33.076 --> 05:35.679
And that is, and just to identify it once again.

05:35.719 --> 05:39.443
The first Welsh New Testament.

05:39.804 --> 05:43.748
First translation into the Welsh language of the New Testament.

05:43.768 --> 05:44.449
And the date on it?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.851
1567.

05:45.871 --> 05:52.758
Little things like that.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.221
This has a little bit of interest.

05:55.502 --> 05:55.922
Wonderful.

05:56.383 --> 05:57.344
Who's that statue?

05:57.404 --> 05:59.026
That little bust up right there, I wonder.

05:59.046 --> 06:01.108
That is the...

06:01.612 --> 06:19.283
James Thomas The interesting part is that the

06:19.651 --> 06:47.751
actual um bust is by uh rubillac oh really okay so that's uh oh that's the white cliff bible that's a very famous bible well now that one is handwritten that's a that's an uh 15th century manuscript yes so that is all handwritten well the site of the bible because of course when you use

06:48.727 --> 06:51.590
The word sorry implies strong drink.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.154
Whatever strong drink is used, this one uses silence.

06:56.174 --> 06:58.276
Yes, yes.

06:58.296 --> 07:01.419
So, of course, it's most appropriate to hear it.

07:01.439 --> 07:05.563
The first complete translation of the Bible into English composed by the followers of the church.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.705
We followed John Rockworth in the late 14th century.

07:07.725 --> 07:16.894
The word cider, spelled cider, S-I-D-I-R, is used in Luke 1.15.

07:17.144 --> 07:19.848
to translate strong and great.

07:19.969 --> 07:20.810
That's right.

07:21.130 --> 07:24.536
Which is much supposed to say, Harry Potter.

07:24.556 --> 07:31.527
And this is the only medieval manuscript in English in the library.

07:31.547 --> 07:38.979
That's very important.

07:38.999 --> 07:43.506
And that's what we can lay on that, given by Robert.

07:48.329 --> 07:50.492
Did you see the Whitecloth Bible thing?

07:51.873 --> 07:53.375
This gentleman is a volunteer.

07:53.415 --> 07:55.198
He's very knowledgeable.

07:56.279 --> 08:00.324
I learn a lot from people like yourself who come around.

08:00.565 --> 08:09.436
This is the only English manuscript in English in the library, and it's called the Cider Bible, because instead of using strong drink, they use cider.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.163
This would probably be done, you see, by...

08:15.869 --> 08:22.175
from a bookseller who would have a team of scribes who would do, and you can see the batches.

08:22.935 --> 08:31.623
You see, each one would probably do a batch of those, of these, you see.

08:31.643 --> 08:35.187
And copy them there.

08:35.207 --> 08:38.890
But the white book Bible is very famous.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.733
It's the first translation of the Bible into English.

08:41.793 --> 08:44.475
It makes it very important.

08:46.312 --> 08:59.899
I'm taking a train back to London this afternoon.
