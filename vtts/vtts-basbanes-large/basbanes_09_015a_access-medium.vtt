00:02.917 --> 00:04.098
Dr. John Barsler.

00:04.959 --> 00:06.201
Congratulations on your new book.

00:06.241 --> 00:07.702
Thank you.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.225
And are you starting your tour now?

00:10.686 --> 00:12.868
I was in Washington last week.

00:13.008 --> 00:14.670
I enjoyed that.

00:14.730 --> 00:19.916
Well, that must have been interesting, isn't it?

00:21.037 --> 00:27.725
I was staying with Sheridan there, too, and that's right down from the White House, one of the reasons I wanted to stay.

00:27.925 --> 00:30.848
And on Tuesday night, thanks.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.942
There was a fundraiser.

00:32.982 --> 00:34.504
The DMT ran a fundraiser.

00:34.524 --> 00:49.827
The hotel was practically empty, except for all the sub-army of very professional young men and women with clothes that were totally inappropriate in their age group showed up and filled the hotel, and they were down to the Stairmaster that morning to see what was going on.

00:50.528 --> 00:58.240
And somebody told me, and of course there wasn't any attention, because I was out doing publicity and seeing people.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.463
And that night I walked in the hotel about 6.30,

01:00.798 --> 01:02.580
filled with police and secret service.

01:04.442 --> 01:11.731
In the ballroom was a fundraiser for Kathleen Brown, and the president was due for about 20 minutes.

01:11.751 --> 01:13.273
So I'm standing there.

01:13.313 --> 01:22.343
I went into the lounge area to read the papers and relax.

01:22.383 --> 01:29.792
It was once again a phenomenon of all the businessmen being driven into the lounge while the DNC takes over the lobby and the ballroom.

01:30.346 --> 01:36.896
And I saw the DNP dragging around, and I was reminded that this is a business.

01:37.758 --> 01:46.711
And that it pays okay, but it's far more demanding than it pays.

01:46.732 --> 01:55.425
And that it attracts eager, idealistic, and mobile folks, young folks.

01:56.806 --> 01:58.588
Many of whom may or may not have been married.

01:58.608 --> 02:02.133
They all look young enough not to be married.

02:02.153 --> 02:10.565
And then the figureheads, the ones we see on television, are just part of the background of what's actually going on.

02:11.126 --> 02:17.074
I mean, the number of people moving things around and making events and getting in and out of buildings.

02:17.094 --> 02:18.936
And so that was in 20 minutes.

02:20.178 --> 02:22.341
The president had just poked down.

02:22.581 --> 02:23.783
What did he do when he arrived?

02:24.564 --> 02:25.986
I'm sitting in the lounge for this.

02:26.455 --> 02:29.999
And they had the suit of service went through and made sure we were guest on this.

02:30.019 --> 02:32.442
So that, you know, the show didn't look good about that.

02:32.482 --> 02:38.188
I think it was all the time to guest on this.

02:38.248 --> 02:41.852
And he walked in and I was pleased to see that it was all in court.

02:41.872 --> 02:42.412
Ceremony.

02:42.432 --> 02:42.813
Ceremony.

02:42.833 --> 02:43.253
Ceremony.

02:43.273 --> 02:43.614
Hi.

02:43.794 --> 02:45.876
Okay, Rebecca.

02:46.957 --> 02:50.361
So anyway, I was pleased and a refund given what the book's about.

02:50.401 --> 02:50.882
Sure.

02:51.022 --> 02:52.644
To see the ceremony.

02:52.664 --> 02:53.424
Ceremony.

02:53.685 --> 02:55.787
The traffic.

02:55.987 --> 02:58.371
Nothing like the traffic on the street in New York.

02:58.471 --> 03:10.652
Nothing like the traffic at the wall door or at the Sheraton in New York when corporates sleep in and corporates sleep out.

03:10.672 --> 03:11.513
Nothing like that at all.

03:12.154 --> 03:15.279
More showy, more standoffish, more audience audience.

03:16.241 --> 03:20.408
How would they be responding to the book in Washington that's making some sense of story?

03:23.425 --> 03:28.071
The folk I know who read it, there were a couple people who came up to me about this.

03:28.091 --> 03:29.072
They're really sincere.

03:29.212 --> 03:32.296
And they said, you know, this is really exciting.

03:32.337 --> 03:32.937
It's a good book.

03:32.957 --> 03:34.299
And I kept saying, well, it's true.

03:34.379 --> 03:35.501
It's true.

03:35.621 --> 03:39.165
And that didn't seem to matter.

03:39.185 --> 03:41.388
It didn't seem to, what didn't seem to matter?

03:41.408 --> 03:44.512
They weren't asking that question.

03:44.532 --> 03:46.114
Oh, I see.

03:46.134 --> 03:46.475
I'm sorry.

03:46.975 --> 03:47.156
Okay.

03:47.176 --> 03:52.082
It was, I've created a world entirely out of air and made

03:52.417 --> 04:01.109
public institution and a public building as the newspapers do not allow it to be.

04:01.289 --> 04:18.952
And what I think now is that I've put into the White House the I've been calling it the vocabulary of crisis that we've developed in the media and in the movies.

04:18.972 --> 04:20.955
But also in the vocabulary of soap opera.

04:21.695 --> 04:33.133
And that, in talking about the presidency in that fashion, I'm not demathologizing, I'm nephologizing.

04:33.553 --> 04:36.197
And the newspapers are filled with demathologizing.

04:36.217 --> 04:37.639
The columnists are demathologizing.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.681
That's their job.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.664
You left it to take another text.

04:40.804 --> 04:43.008
Well, it turned out that way because that's what fiction does.

04:44.169 --> 04:46.092
You didn't do this mightfully then.

04:46.193 --> 04:49.137
It turns out to be...

04:49.437 --> 04:50.459
I'm discovering it.

04:50.479 --> 04:54.144
You write the book, and you start to think about it.

04:54.164 --> 05:07.985
And it turns out to be one of the facts that if you, that having mythologized the presidency and the Constitution, I mythologize the Constitution, it's glamorous enough for those who do it that it becomes exciting.

05:08.005 --> 05:09.488
They don't ask the question, is it true?

05:10.870 --> 05:16.238
Some folks have responded, the constitutional scholars who I'm now meeting,

05:17.551 --> 05:27.610
corresponding with, or talking to you on the telephone, have responded in a similar fashion in that they know at the heart of this is a serious discussion.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.516
I'm popular, so that they all go along.

05:31.237 --> 05:35.725
I think this is the worst case scenario.

05:35.906 --> 05:37.669
But the worst case scenario is...

05:38.037 --> 05:40.179
It has resonance.

05:40.199 --> 05:40.620
It isn't.

05:41.060 --> 05:45.045
I was prepared to confront folks saying this is too far faster.

05:45.065 --> 05:55.136
Well, at the Constitutional College, the whole new scheme of time, do they acknowledge this is a scenario or could it play out?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.958
Very easily.

05:56.978 --> 05:58.200
Very easily.

05:58.220 --> 06:03.966
It, in fact, is what they've not been able to do, which is to fill out the stories.

06:04.987 --> 06:07.470
They've been stuck on four paragraphs.

06:08.227 --> 06:13.394
Paragraph one, when the presidency is open, the vice president becomes president.

06:13.414 --> 06:13.955
That's obvious.

06:13.995 --> 06:15.156
It's happening.

06:15.737 --> 06:18.881
Paragraph two, when the vice president is open, you appoint a new vice president.

06:18.901 --> 06:19.382
That's happening.

06:19.722 --> 06:20.463
Ford and Rockefeller.

06:21.725 --> 06:26.992
Paragraph three and paragraph four that have never worked, never going to act to work, have been run from.

06:28.775 --> 06:37.947
And the scholars get stuck on three, which is the temporary transfer of power.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.994
under what conditions, and who says so, and how long.

06:42.855 --> 06:48.242
And a little bit on four, what if the president's not competence, how do we challenge him?

06:48.262 --> 06:50.324
He judges competency.

06:50.605 --> 07:05.402
What they've not been able to do, because that's not how scholarship or history works, the newspaper's guys work, is to take those elements into what a fiction writer can do, turn it into a drama of verisimilitude.

07:05.770 --> 07:06.491
Thank you.

07:06.511 --> 07:11.138
I haven't used that word in the computer or in newspapers in a long time.

07:11.158 --> 07:12.019
Well, it's a wonderful word.

07:12.039 --> 07:12.961
It's a wonderful word.

07:13.261 --> 07:14.122
Very similar.

07:14.163 --> 07:16.506
No, I know the word.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.250
No, I mean, whenever I use it, people go like this.

07:19.310 --> 07:19.991
It's very similar.

07:20.232 --> 07:26.140
For a 12.6 pica column, I mean, it takes up half a line in its own right.

07:26.641 --> 07:30.567
Well, that's what apologizing does is verisimilitude.

07:30.647 --> 07:34.613
This is not a debunking of the institution and the Constitution.

07:35.234 --> 07:39.801
this is a mythologizing of it.

07:40.342 --> 07:46.893
And that has weight for those who actually get down in there and try to change the Constitution.

07:46.913 --> 07:55.306
Now you have, pardon me, you have gained some celebrity from getting somewhat prophetic in several different levels.

07:55.927 --> 08:01.917
When you said about coming up with this premise and

08:02.673 --> 08:06.157
fleshing a novel around this skeleton here.

08:06.658 --> 08:12.826
Is it pure entertainment in what you were doing in this particular case?

08:12.846 --> 08:21.217
Were you actually positing something that you think is a likelihood?

08:21.237 --> 08:26.764
I was looking for the end of the story.

08:27.304 --> 08:30.068
Having Ken's monitor come across it.

08:30.128 --> 08:32.511
Once I got the idea, I said, what if?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.396
Did you have the ending with when you started?

08:35.456 --> 08:37.559
No.

08:37.759 --> 08:46.771
That's why I think I can safely say I defy anyone to get the ending of this book because I didn't know the ending.

08:46.791 --> 08:47.332
That's great.

08:48.413 --> 08:50.376
As we speak, I haven't finished it.

08:51.077 --> 08:57.746
You cannot predict it because what happened is the author got in there and the characters took over and they tricked me.

08:57.766 --> 08:59.608
They dumped me.

08:59.648 --> 09:01.030
The Constitution had to dump me.

09:01.769 --> 09:10.961
I was trying to find the idea of the story.

09:11.161 --> 09:17.710
What I think is going on here, what I think is going on here is that I've discovered that there's a problem, a big problem with the Constitution.

09:17.730 --> 09:20.193
It's a time bomb.

09:20.213 --> 09:31.067
And I've made it bigger than life to make sure that everybody gets to the point that if you don't think it's possible, then it shouldn't be in the Constitution anymore.

09:31.520 --> 09:35.105
The fact that it's there means it's possible.

09:35.125 --> 09:43.376
And if you think that we take care of it, then you haven't looked recently at what happened when this country goes into the crisis model.

09:43.396 --> 09:53.190
If you think it's improbable that one president would be ill and the vice president would challenge his competence to rule,

09:53.525 --> 09:56.568
You haven't checked.

09:56.808 --> 09:58.870
Well, I mean, you talk about what-ifs.

09:58.911 --> 10:01.193
Reagan never knew what he was having for lunch each day.

10:01.293 --> 10:06.138
Well, there are prejudices and there are anecdotes for the last 27 years.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.660
This is ratified in 67.

10:08.781 --> 10:18.290
Again and again, you can use these anecdotes as a way of saying common sense and crisis approach the mechanism in the 25th and pull back from it.

10:18.310 --> 10:21.013
Approach it and pull back from it.

10:21.734 --> 10:22.555
Point.

10:22.575 --> 10:22.755
19...

10:23.512 --> 10:50.599
uh, 74th of July, the last week of the Nixon administration, the chief of staff paid... Acts in a way that later he's given credit for, to, uh, disconnect

10:51.136 --> 10:54.901
the president from his role of commander-in-chief.

10:56.263 --> 10:57.144
Well, that's 82.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.507
I'm talking about 74 when he was chief of staff.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.072
Right, secretary of state.

11:03.512 --> 11:05.234
He's involved in two instances.

11:05.254 --> 11:10.702
The first one is more interesting because it's involved in the military, which is what my book involves.

11:10.722 --> 11:17.110
He disconnects the commander-in-chief during the Cold War, during the young war crisis, during fresh after

11:17.528 --> 11:25.238
confrontational lunacy during the Soviet state terrorism, he disconnects the commander-in-chief from the mechanism.

11:25.298 --> 11:33.469
In other words, the football is taken out of the camp for the last week of July and the beginning of August.

11:33.509 --> 11:45.105
That mechanism, that is the mechanism of the 25th, and Hague pulled back from it with the collusion, according to his own testimony, of the Pentagon.

11:45.507 --> 11:49.371
Not transferring power, however.

11:50.272 --> 11:51.554
The staff held the power.

11:51.594 --> 11:59.302
They were fearful that he was going to do something bad, isn't that correct?

11:59.402 --> 12:08.292
The 25th is written to provide the mechanism so that when the vice president, who is the only person who has the power,

12:08.812 --> 12:11.115
comes to the conclusion that the president is not to be trusted.

12:11.135 --> 12:14.278
The vice president challenges and takes away that power immediately.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.561
It is his or her duty.

12:16.581 --> 12:32.638
But instead, we have the chief of staff, not elected, former army general, former commander of the forces in Europe, taking that mechanism away and giving it to no one, keeping it in the staff.

12:32.678 --> 12:36.943
The point that I make is that presidents aren't men or women.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.785
They're 1,000-member staff.

12:39.052 --> 12:41.895
and 1,000 member staff do not see power easily.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.417
Was this the incident?

12:44.537 --> 12:47.339
Was this book inspired by an incident?

12:47.459 --> 12:58.329
No, that is one of the activities that I was thinking about when I constructed the military and White House collusion.

12:58.409 --> 13:04.655
Another incident that I was thinking of was Hague's famous I'm in Charge Here, Vermont, in 82.

13:04.715 --> 13:08.518
Again, same character, 10 minutes later, learned nothing.

13:08.887 --> 13:11.571
about succession of the mechanisms of the 25th.

13:12.412 --> 13:22.606
At that point, anecdotal evidence afterwards, tested on by those in Reagan's entourage, they weren't thinking 25th.

13:23.067 --> 13:37.527
They weren't even knowledgeable about it, so that the White House counsel, Fielding at the time, Fred Fielding, should have been carrying the papers with him, wasn't, nor did he have the letters to initiate the mechanisms of the 25th.

13:37.777 --> 13:52.659
And Vice President Bush, who was in Texas and on a plane coming home, on Air Force Two coming home, should have been informed and transfer of power should have happened immediately upon collapse of the president.

13:52.679 --> 13:55.062
That was how the 25th was written.

13:55.082 --> 13:57.065
That is what it is meant to be.

13:57.085 --> 14:04.095
Because it is not, indicates there's, is one of the strange ways to indicate there's a big problem with it.

14:04.115 --> 14:07.480
There's common sense and the nature of power pulled back from it.

14:07.662 --> 14:15.299
but it was constructed to be an automatic mechanism to provide continuity in times of catastrophe.

14:15.319 --> 14:20.450
It's often said that the Constitution is the original document.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.154
It's an inspiring document.

14:22.174 --> 14:27.105
I gather you don't feel that those who framed the 25th Amendment were

14:27.490 --> 14:32.056
or similarly inspiring that it is egregiously flawed.

14:33.137 --> 14:39.085
I think in 1967, what we have to be, let's do what is, in seminary terms, is known as high history.

14:40.086 --> 14:40.827
High history.

14:41.508 --> 14:42.629
Let's put it in context.

14:42.669 --> 14:49.198
In 1967, we're in the depths of the Cold War.

14:49.218 --> 14:51.921
The 25th Amendment is a Cold War document.

14:52.962 --> 14:56.687
It is an artifact of the necessity of constant

14:57.190 --> 15:01.495
decision-making authority in the event of a catastrophe.

15:01.515 --> 15:18.373
The Succession Act of 1947, which is the one that numbers the presidency all the way down to the least among them, the Department of Education, and then down further to now the... Madeleine Albright is now, I think, like 20th on the list.

15:18.994 --> 15:23.458
That's the 1947 Succession Act, because she's now become a member of the Cabinet.

15:23.478 --> 15:25.120
1947 Succession Act.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.742
All right, now that's the Cold War.

15:27.363 --> 15:32.871
Also, in 1967, they're living under the shadow of JFK's death.

15:33.853 --> 15:50.057
Bobby Kennedy's in the Congress, and they're also remembering Eisenhower's collapse and heart attack in 58, and Richard Nixon's non-performance during those critical times when Eisenhower may or may not have been healthy enough to go on.

15:51.239 --> 15:55.986
And it's the dark ages of mental health

15:56.675 --> 16:00.539
I'm not saying we're in the light right now, but at least you can name the 60s and the dark ages.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.381
There was no pharmacotherapy that was trustworthy.

16:04.462 --> 16:16.173
And a person, a person mentally ill person, especially a person with clinical depression, was regarded as having a character flaw, a consequence of events, not understood.

16:16.193 --> 16:23.961
There was no enlightened language understanding mental illness and illness, especially mental illness for entirely successful people.

16:24.642 --> 16:26.243
Now, 27 years later,

16:26.780 --> 16:29.763
To be fair, we're better educated.

16:29.783 --> 16:30.603
We're more articulate.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.927
We have a vocabulary that can handle mental illness.

16:34.947 --> 16:35.748
The Cold War's over.

16:36.809 --> 16:46.958
We also understand that communications and power are different than they were in 67, and that there's no hiding the facts.

16:46.978 --> 16:54.745
Some of the scholars also debated in the 60s, when they debated this for three years in the Senate of Congress, the famous story of Edith Bolling Wilson,

16:55.197 --> 17:10.470
and the White House physician colluding to conceal from, to have an inclination, the fact that Woodrow Wilson was in combat for the last 17, 18 months of his administration.

17:10.490 --> 17:15.915
And that was often cited in the testimony as something we must guard against.

17:15.935 --> 17:24.883
At the same time, there were moments in the testimony where you can see Bobby Kennedy, Senator Pejorie, thinking

17:25.285 --> 17:31.494
I don't want this to be easy because, God damn it, what if that character LBJ tried to take it away from my brother?

17:31.534 --> 17:32.716
What if my brother hadn't died?

17:33.637 --> 17:34.678
That's right.

17:34.698 --> 17:41.528
So that's why paragraph four is built so... What if he was brain dead, too?

17:42.790 --> 17:45.734
They were thinking of gunshots and heart attacks.

17:45.754 --> 17:47.817
They were not thinking of mental competence.

17:47.837 --> 17:49.519
It's just a big problem.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.442
Huge problem.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.605
I started this book July 1st of last year.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.073
Fourteen days later, Vince Foster is dead.

17:58.576 --> 18:02.182
And all I read for days afterwards is the prejudice of the media.

18:04.164 --> 18:05.066
Why did he kill himself?

18:05.106 --> 18:05.566
We don't know.

18:05.606 --> 18:19.206
The prejudice of the administration, the less than articulate remarks by his best friend, Clinton, about, I just talked to him last night, he gave no indication that he was a friend, or unhappy, or that this could have happened.

18:19.606 --> 18:20.908
We weep for him.

18:21.175 --> 18:31.727
All that wonderful consoling language, not articulate about the fact that mental illness, particularly clinical depression, comes to successful menopause.

18:33.068 --> 18:36.072
And it comes out of denial so that there is no clue.

18:37.393 --> 18:44.121
And that it's a crisis that must be dealt with before it gets to the illness stage.

18:44.141 --> 18:47.284
It must be made, especially in command positions.

18:47.534 --> 18:48.415
Thank you.

18:48.435 --> 18:51.138
Did you read Siren's book on depression?

18:51.318 --> 18:52.279
No, I didn't.

18:52.299 --> 18:57.666
What I read was the... See, that's a testimony.

18:57.686 --> 19:06.416
I was reading the monographs, because the monographs have accelerated, particularly after the introduction of Prozac.

19:06.436 --> 19:12.583
The monographs have accelerated about denial and reformation and transformation.

19:13.103 --> 19:17.288
And I'm only interested in one particular kind of illness, which is that which strikes

19:17.622 --> 19:29.160
My president is a brave man, Teddy J. Because at the top of his powers, he recognizes things not there.

19:29.180 --> 19:41.419
After his wife has left him, he perceives that with all the trappings of power around him, he perceives that he is ill and voluntarily steps himself, voluntarily hospitalizes himself.

19:41.439 --> 19:43.883
I would say the science fiction aspect of this book is that

19:44.167 --> 20:10.258
public is so converse is conversant enough to understand what the president is doing at that point and it is to his credit instead of understanding him as weak it is to his credit to understand that he's ill and he's taking care of himself because that is his duty um to go back to the question about how this 25th amendment was framed and then you answered during a period in which

20:11.167 --> 20:38.946
the goal was to resolve a problem that seemed to be dated to that time whereas the framers of the constitution have always been credited with their their their by reaching uh their perception that this is really this has to have room to breathe and to expand and to and to adjust to a changing culture and society clearly this isn't what happened with the 25th it was really focused focused maybe that's what the floor is why it's not

20:39.247 --> 20:43.734
I think you've said it very well.

20:44.215 --> 20:56.273
What we have here is a codification of what wasn't broke, and that by trying to fix what wasn't broke, you invited the lawyers in.

20:57.155 --> 21:03.004
In truth, and I'll pop this up, I'll give you the burning building talk.

21:03.024 --> 21:07.110
The day the 25th Amendment is invoked, we are in a state of civil war.

21:11.174 --> 21:16.883
Everybody has something to gain, something to lose at.

21:18.405 --> 21:20.528
Several things will happen.

21:20.548 --> 21:22.010
And they're fun to think about.

21:22.050 --> 21:25.796
Only because they're so lurid.

21:25.816 --> 21:35.090
One of the most fun of when I was on the Stairmaster this morning, I was thinking of it because they had the Today Show on them, which I never see in New York because I'm too busy with the kids with babies.

21:38.014 --> 21:39.797
That chair, Brian Gumbel's chair,

21:40.165 --> 21:47.994
and across with him the chair of the correspondent, the book, the representation of the representative.

21:48.275 --> 22:00.409
That chair will be fought over by two powerful propaganda machines.

22:01.210 --> 22:05.075
One, the vice president with the powers of the White House.

22:06.016 --> 22:09.160
Two, the president with the powers of the White House.

22:10.270 --> 22:14.876
Both of those factions will be armed.

22:14.896 --> 22:16.458
Who is Gumbel going to speak with?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.282
Who is going to put who in that chair?

22:19.422 --> 22:22.767
How do they decide the next morning?

22:22.787 --> 22:24.069
Whose story gets told?

22:25.611 --> 22:26.652
Civil war.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.377
In the media, okay, another place.

22:31.138 --> 22:36.245
We now have Shelley Fashbili dispatching the 24th Division to Iraq.

22:36.966 --> 22:38.488
The 10th Mount is in here.

22:40.088 --> 22:47.096
The fourth division, the fourth ID is on alert, standby all the time, pre-positioned equipment for Korea.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.964
Who does Shalikashvili listen to the next morning?

22:52.984 --> 23:09.083
82nd Airborne, right, boasted correctly that it is in condition, General Steele commanding, it is in condition and demonstrated during the Haitian episode to be wheeled up and ready to go.

23:09.907 --> 23:14.534
and in the air, and going, and he's in plane number one, 18 hours after the order comes.

23:14.554 --> 23:16.217
From whom?

23:16.237 --> 23:17.159
To where?

23:19.182 --> 23:20.143
Third.

23:20.243 --> 23:24.510
A lot of faith involved here, isn't it?

23:24.831 --> 23:25.772
Third.

23:25.792 --> 23:31.461
That morning, Gambo, chair being fought over by armed characters.

23:35.247 --> 23:35.928
Military.

23:36.630 --> 23:36.910
What?

23:38.510 --> 23:39.411
He said, what?

23:39.632 --> 23:40.693
Who's telling us what?

23:40.733 --> 23:42.075
To do when?

23:42.115 --> 23:45.119
Third thing is going to happen.

23:45.139 --> 23:52.770
About 90 minutes from when Gumbel's watching that chair being fought over, the market cannot open.

23:52.790 --> 23:57.357
He can't find a price.

23:57.377 --> 24:00.682
The Treasury bond overnight trading in Europe out of Hong Kong?

24:01.303 --> 24:07.892
No bids.

24:08.328 --> 24:10.332
That's part of the crisis.

24:10.452 --> 24:15.841
In this book, my acting president understands that and uses it.

24:15.861 --> 24:23.074
Understands that he only has so many hours to conduct this whole operation, otherwise there's not too much of a country left.

24:23.334 --> 24:26.139
Do you formulate this over a period of time?

24:26.159 --> 24:28.283
I'm putting together things that have already happened.

24:28.303 --> 24:31.028
Yeah, I have to object with an effective...

24:31.615 --> 24:41.605
Well, I just put myself in the place of how would we accelerate into this?

24:41.625 --> 24:46.670
We've got a communications business, an information elite that are capable.

24:47.131 --> 24:47.872
We are capable.

24:48.012 --> 24:48.572
We're part of it.

24:49.013 --> 24:54.839
We are capable of taking a story and really pumping it up, spinning it.

24:54.919 --> 24:59.884
And this is the Constitution and presidential succession.

25:00.421 --> 25:02.703
Lord knows there are no rules when it gets to that level.

25:02.903 --> 25:04.585
None whatsoever.

25:04.605 --> 25:05.926
Nobody's going to come in and referee.

25:05.966 --> 25:06.786
There's no time.

25:08.088 --> 25:27.124
You know, John, reading this book, I have to say I'm... I've written about your deciding, well, I can do this.

25:27.604 --> 25:29.466
This is something that I can do.

25:29.733 --> 25:32.537
I can't tell you how many authors I've interviewed over the years.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.585
One in particular, Richard Gates, who was wonderful.

25:37.705 --> 25:39.167
I loved it.

25:39.187 --> 25:45.877
And I remember this poor guy lived in near poverty right up here in Boston, a couple blocks from here.

25:45.897 --> 25:53.729
And I remember him saying, quote, if I knew how to write a bestseller, believe me, I would do it.

25:53.749 --> 25:54.790
I just don't know how to do it.

25:55.051 --> 25:56.753
I write only one way.

25:57.070 --> 26:11.108
You, on the other hand, mindfully, apparently, if I read what I've read, decided, apparently, you decided to write something that would be accessible to the general readership to a wider audience.

26:11.128 --> 26:15.193
Is that a fair representation of what happened here?

26:15.273 --> 26:18.657
What I've really decided to do is change the case.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.639
Dave Halberstam does about the same thing.

26:21.659 --> 26:28.266
He does one big, fat, serious, non-fiction book, and then he does a little baseball book.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.087
Dave Halberstam does about the same thing.

26:30.107 --> 26:35.332
He does one big, fat, serious, non-fiction book, and then he does a little baseball book.

26:35.352 --> 26:41.398
Dave Halberstam does a lot of baseball books.

26:41.538 --> 26:46.022
I did not write this book to be non-serious.

26:46.042 --> 26:48.745
What I did was I did a technical change, real technical.

26:49.703 --> 26:53.849
This is craft talk.

26:53.989 --> 26:54.970
Craft talk.

26:55.872 --> 26:57.233
Which I love, by the way.

26:57.454 --> 26:59.717
My pieces are generally craft talk.

26:59.737 --> 27:00.758
All right, craft talk.

27:00.778 --> 27:06.707
We'll do shop talk, craft talk.

27:06.807 --> 27:14.918
It would be impossible for anyone to argue that someone like me, myself,

27:15.134 --> 27:19.120
Someone could say, I'm going to set out to write a constitutional thriller, and everybody would just laugh.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.181
Oh, that's a hoot.

27:20.622 --> 27:21.824
And you're going to sell it, huh?

27:22.685 --> 27:25.589
And so, I mean, let's have the lament here.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.211
Yeah, this is the constitutional thriller.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.194
It's a presidential thriller.

27:29.274 --> 27:32.199
The thriller part, my people will go along with the constitutional thriller.

27:32.940 --> 27:36.204
So I make craft adjustments.

27:36.224 --> 27:45.057
At the center of this book, here are themes that I've always considered, which is a surprise for the name.

27:46.420 --> 27:58.074
of all things, and that the vanity of power is it, is what the problem is.

27:58.094 --> 28:02.439
The success of powerful man stops.

28:02.859 --> 28:09.047
Those themes I've followed before, but having applied that Protestantism, the craft changes.

28:09.868 --> 28:14.173
I wrote a book in what I've called already the vocabulary crisis.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.275
I took it from the media and television.

28:16.677 --> 28:30.496
Single sentence paragraphs is how we now get our news.

28:32.199 --> 28:35.563
It is the lead in television language called soundbites.

28:36.064 --> 28:41.672
But in newspapers, tabloids have now become serious discourse.

28:42.547 --> 28:48.796
A single sentence paragraph is how you get the punchlines, the headlines, the readers.

28:49.538 --> 28:58.551
Also, the other day I was sitting in New York talking to... But it's the vocabulary of crisis journalism.

28:59.212 --> 29:02.998
It is not second-thinking journalism.

29:03.398 --> 29:05.301
It is not there on the other hand.

29:05.321 --> 29:07.404
It is now, now, now, now, now.

29:08.566 --> 29:11.811
Characters in the book have...

29:12.061 --> 29:39.604
ambition and they are all ambitious people nobody questions that there's no underlying theme of nobility here you keep going or you just fall away um there's no reservation as there was in the days of public discourse in this city uh sam adams the jameses of uh serving god and country of uh enhancing the power of the commonwealth

29:40.225 --> 29:45.150
No, they're always in the attack mode.

29:45.610 --> 29:50.756
Jack and Chief, a fugitive hero and heroine, are running for the presidency.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.939
Occasionally they have doubts, but there's no time.

29:55.420 --> 30:02.588
And their motive here is to save the president because they're going to run to the office next year.

30:03.309 --> 30:09.675
They're not going to allow the stronger of the two to win because they're going to have to run against him next February.

30:10.398 --> 30:13.982
They're going to undermine the stronger candidates.

30:14.142 --> 30:16.144
Garland's clearly the stronger of the two men.

30:17.606 --> 30:21.410
The more ruthless, because he's a better campaigner and he'd be tougher to beat.

30:22.872 --> 30:25.435
All right, now.

30:25.455 --> 30:25.835
Craft.

30:27.117 --> 30:31.141
Single sentence paragraphs.

30:31.161 --> 30:31.782
Short takes.

30:31.802 --> 30:36.247
Not long enough to get hungry.

30:36.307 --> 30:37.148
Move the camera.

30:37.853 --> 30:39.815
Here, here, here, here.

30:39.835 --> 30:40.696
So you're just thinking visually.

30:41.197 --> 30:43.920
I was thinking visually, and I'm thinking how we get the news on.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.223
Headline news.

30:47.243 --> 30:47.323
CNN.

30:47.343 --> 30:47.764
The rap.

30:47.784 --> 30:49.065
20 minutes to get the world.

30:49.085 --> 30:50.307
20 minutes to get the world.

30:51.528 --> 30:55.012
The way that editors link the stories.

30:55.032 --> 30:57.935
What the order of things is always thematic.

30:57.995 --> 30:59.437
They find a way of thematic.

30:59.837 --> 31:03.321
It often is hilarious, or it's prejudicial, but it's thematic.

31:04.297 --> 31:07.622
Has to be.

31:08.202 --> 31:11.447
I don't have commercials to cut away to.

31:11.507 --> 31:12.208
I don't have that.

31:12.308 --> 31:15.593
So what I do is I have the frames.

31:17.095 --> 31:20.139
And then I move the time to the temporal progression.

31:20.219 --> 31:25.727
A cynic might think that you're also thinking of a cinematic.

31:26.328 --> 31:32.937
Well, I was not because this is a wordcraft problem.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.432
I have to do it entirely on the page.

31:35.652 --> 31:36.613
No pictures allowed.

31:36.933 --> 31:40.617
I have to make you think they're pictures.

31:40.697 --> 31:43.820
I have to make you see pictures.

31:45.962 --> 31:50.226
But I don't have any audio, nor do I have any fast-forward.

31:50.286 --> 31:55.211
So that's why there's this other craft consideration.

31:55.231 --> 32:03.379
I think the bestseller list is, now that I've looked at it, these books are

32:03.578 --> 32:07.284
And the wrong way to read them is closely.

32:09.126 --> 32:11.971
So I ask myself, how is this possible?

32:12.972 --> 32:14.895
What is it that makes me comfortable?

32:15.917 --> 32:19.262
And a large part of that is the celebrity business.

32:19.502 --> 32:22.967
Well, no, I have a response to that.

32:23.027 --> 32:29.417
I can hear the crap response.

32:30.038 --> 32:39.147
What I've decided what we do is, in fact, we read the novels the way we want to read the novels.

32:39.167 --> 32:43.851
Anne Rice or Sheldon or The Celestine Prophecy.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.735
Anne Rice's books are 400 or 500 pages long.

32:49.957 --> 32:54.081
What you do when you open that page is you only read a few sentences on the page.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.244
You read for the story that you want to get out of it.

32:57.545 --> 33:00.571
You read for the action or you follow a character.

33:00.591 --> 33:02.215
You don't read her adverbs.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.858
God knows you don't read her adverbs.

33:04.620 --> 33:07.105
You don't let those cliches heap up.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.971
You can't because it would just, it would animate you.

33:10.552 --> 33:14.941
So that a very thick book turns out to be a very thin book.

33:14.962 --> 33:16.585
And it reads quickly.

33:16.605 --> 33:18.068
You keep flipping the pages.

33:18.436 --> 33:22.402
The eye doesn't, the brain does it, depending on education, prejudice, and all that.

33:22.422 --> 33:26.068
Are you giving the general reader perhaps a bit more credit than it deserves?

33:26.088 --> 33:27.410
No, I think this is how we read.

33:27.570 --> 33:28.752
I think this is how folk read.

33:29.233 --> 33:40.590
What I then set out to do was to write a book that only controlled, only consistent of the lines your eyes skip to, thinking that that would speed it up, and it does.

33:41.011 --> 33:42.253
You see how fast it reads.

33:42.393 --> 33:45.017
I have to tell you, I read

33:45.402 --> 33:47.404
I like those.

33:47.624 --> 33:50.387
I read them just to enjoy.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.049
And I love them.

33:52.149 --> 33:55.313
And I consider myself knowledgeable on the subject.

33:55.453 --> 33:59.097
And I have to tell you, I mean, this is no fluke.

33:59.117 --> 34:02.620
You've got a nice job.

34:02.760 --> 34:07.425
Talking is one who appreciates these books.

34:07.445 --> 34:12.130
And I read them unashamedly, without apology.

34:13.232 --> 34:14.633
I enjoy it.

34:15.457 --> 34:17.980
You know, you've done a good job here.

34:18.000 --> 34:18.481
You've got me.

34:18.561 --> 34:20.323
I'm engaged.

34:21.264 --> 34:24.769
I'm trying to throw garland in here.

34:25.590 --> 34:29.855
A garland is the word for the Vice President's name.

34:29.875 --> 34:33.600
There are lots of Dickensian ponds in here.

34:35.222 --> 34:36.944
Throw the garland.

34:36.964 --> 34:38.706
The garland wearer.

34:41.470 --> 34:44.974
That's the big thing about why I chose this category.

34:46.287 --> 34:49.512
The first reason, I love the category.

34:49.653 --> 34:50.634
So, choose something as well.

34:51.315 --> 34:53.319
And I love this category.

34:53.479 --> 34:55.002
And I've always played with it.

34:55.022 --> 35:00.551
I've just played with it in the confessional voice, the I accuse myself voice of literature.

35:00.751 --> 35:02.975
This time, I decided to control that voice.

35:02.995 --> 35:03.416
It's there.

35:03.516 --> 35:05.219
It comes out every once in a while, but I control it.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.386
What kind of a, and you don't mind my jumping around the board a little bit.

35:09.406 --> 35:12.531
I'm the one who makes sense to say.

35:12.798 --> 35:29.814
You've got it good, that opening scene.

35:29.974 --> 35:33.642
That's meant to be.

35:34.347 --> 35:36.831
That's meant to be the best book you've ever read.

35:36.931 --> 35:53.878
I mean, I know, I know protocols, I know, I know language, you know, the ovaries and the elves, if it's appropriate, and, uh, you have it, you know, you have the Roger, oh, right, I'm saying, well, no, this should be a Roger, oh, no, wait a minute, he's expecting a response here, but, I mean, you did some work here to get this out.

35:54.619 --> 36:00.388
Yeah, I tried, I, I, it's a vocabulary.

36:00.993 --> 36:01.514
You can learn it.

36:01.634 --> 36:03.117
Now, do you pick this up out of books?

36:03.137 --> 36:04.339
Do you have technical advice?

36:04.359 --> 36:04.860
Other books.

36:05.281 --> 36:05.802
Other books.

36:05.842 --> 36:07.585
It's all in books.

36:08.286 --> 36:08.807
It's all there.

36:08.987 --> 36:11.492
And if you imitate the real thing, that's all you need to do.

36:11.993 --> 36:16.080
My favorite line in the Three Days of the Marvel movie and the Six Days of the Car.

36:16.100 --> 36:16.821
Six Days of the Car.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.065
Well, the book is Six Days of the Car.

36:19.386 --> 36:19.947
Life is through us.

36:20.483 --> 36:38.768
And I don't need to go to much more than that.

36:39.149 --> 36:45.398
They did have the additional help because the books themselves don't get into the blank.

36:46.259 --> 36:46.659
They can't.

36:47.621 --> 36:49.343
They did have the additional help.

36:49.711 --> 37:00.866
I mean, I was able to read the naval proceedings about some of the attacks on Iraq, so you get some of the language that actually went on from the aircraft to the ship.

37:00.886 --> 37:17.608
But my baby brother is a captain of the military, so that he went through what is or is not necessary in dealing with the procedures.

37:18.162 --> 37:24.411
And I know from talking to him that you can just lose... I was losing things that are in the books that were not necessary.

37:24.531 --> 37:26.354
I would read to them and say they're there.

37:26.815 --> 37:29.178
And then I would change things, too, because I thought they were inappropriate.

37:29.198 --> 37:41.817
For example, the radio, the man-packed transceiver that I call the horn.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.640
I don't have them mic'd up.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.823
I have them use real carry-around.

37:46.124 --> 37:53.955
is called a prick in army parlance, because it's T-R-Q-35.

37:54.977 --> 37:58.502
And I chose not to use that.

37:58.602 --> 38:06.433
So I was making, I was backing off from the technical language when I thought that it was, it got in the way of going straight through.

38:06.874 --> 38:09.638
It got in the way of cinema.

38:09.658 --> 38:11.881
I was also using the technical way of cinema.

38:13.143 --> 38:14.865
The cinematic flow.

38:14.947 --> 38:15.788
I'm thinking of this.

38:16.148 --> 38:16.849
I'm seeing it.

38:17.850 --> 38:19.672
This is not what Hollywood does.

38:20.433 --> 38:25.559
Hollywood storytelling is very different.

38:25.719 --> 38:26.020
I think.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.603
I think they tell the story differently than the story is told.

38:29.163 --> 38:30.705
They don't have the control that I have.

38:31.406 --> 38:36.852
And also they don't see and feel and smell the way I can do it seeing.

38:37.293 --> 38:39.896
Smell is not possible in Hollywood.

38:40.517 --> 38:40.937
And sounds

38:41.305 --> 38:48.712
is not credible either, because there's always a domineering sound, and there's always a voice, and they must speak in sentences.

38:48.812 --> 38:51.555
In a good American dictionary, that's not credible either.

38:54.057 --> 39:04.066
So I would get into a scene, and I would have the raw detail, and I chose not to rewrite it in the confessional voice, which the literature teaches you.

39:04.086 --> 39:08.130
So that's why, oftentimes, they're not even sentences.

39:08.150 --> 39:09.992
The brief sentences are not complete.

39:10.012 --> 39:11.093
They're frank.

39:11.495 --> 39:15.720
That's the way I work.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.082
I'm seeing data.

39:18.143 --> 39:19.224
And I would just give it to you.

39:19.284 --> 39:25.251
And then in the editing process, I would cut it in or take it out, depending on whether I thought it was my editing.

39:25.471 --> 39:26.252
My editing.

39:26.272 --> 39:28.054
Mine going over and over and over.

39:28.074 --> 39:33.721
I depend on Alan for the big stuff of, I don't like this, I like this.

39:34.882 --> 39:36.404
And then I'm supposed to figure out why.

39:37.445 --> 39:40.489
Did he ever tell you, by the way, that...

39:40.756 --> 40:01.211
No, I didn't know that part.

40:01.331 --> 40:03.996
It was in the Clayton Plant Dealers.

40:04.094 --> 40:33.392
no i think it was he didn't want to be at the women's telegram but now it started my engagement first uh my memory i think they do that that clothes thing that fool people that's a great book you might if i use it yeah

40:33.625 --> 40:35.047
Have you ever seen them together in a row?

40:41.557 --> 40:42.418
Let's go back now.

40:42.538 --> 40:43.980
Let's pick up the thread here.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.065
Where were we, do you remember?

40:47.085 --> 40:52.132
Well, no, really, although we were talking about the tech of the craft.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.495
I'll do the whole list again.

40:56.158 --> 40:57.620
Changes that I felt we were making.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.683
I wanted to go fast.

41:00.406 --> 41:05.675
So I wrote a book that only has a line, but I think you skipped it.

41:05.695 --> 41:11.123
I wrote it in the Caballet of Crisis, the tabloid, CNN, book cover.

41:11.264 --> 41:21.721
I knew I was going to layer in the novel, so I was going to compensate for that by allowing you to come close and move back.

41:21.961 --> 41:23.023
So what was this frightening for?

41:23.043 --> 41:26.609
Was this like carpentry in this particular phase?

41:26.729 --> 41:27.510
I like craft.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.508
Yeah, I like craft.

41:29.568 --> 41:30.910
I like to talk about craft.

41:30.950 --> 41:41.767
I mean, I could probably put together an extremely tedious seminar that would be very well attended to talk about the craft of the pastel.

41:41.967 --> 41:45.172
Yes, I was.

41:45.192 --> 41:50.781
As I wrote it down, I would respond to it, saying, this is working.

41:51.436 --> 41:56.220
Did you have a reader in mind?

41:56.260 --> 41:57.422
Myself?

41:58.062 --> 42:00.785
No, really, I was really trying to create something fast.

42:02.406 --> 42:03.147
For yourself?

42:03.607 --> 42:05.329
Just to see if it could be done.

42:05.349 --> 42:08.071
To change my speed.

42:09.233 --> 42:14.217
Change the speed of the long Peter Nevsky story, which is the Russian novel, the long paragraph.

42:14.838 --> 42:18.321
Change the speed and change the tempo.

42:19.010 --> 42:22.675
To move the reader in and out of scenes faster.

42:22.695 --> 42:25.399
To only give you information that's critical.

42:25.419 --> 42:28.343
To allow you to see the characters in action only.

42:28.644 --> 42:30.266
Not in reflection, not in regret.

42:32.870 --> 42:38.658
To layer the trail upon the trail and yet still have the moving towards an end point.

42:39.019 --> 42:41.322
Tricks, not tricks, crack decisions.

42:42.145 --> 42:45.449
Primary characters are going to be called by their first names.

42:48.153 --> 42:53.600
Villains or secondary characters are going to be called by their lessons.

42:53.960 --> 43:02.911
All thinking, when the thinking was critical to moving the story, particularly when it's a put in a straw, it's going to be an eye cap.

43:02.931 --> 43:04.153
So your eye won't.

43:04.403 --> 43:08.129
will go to her as if it was dialogue.

43:08.530 --> 43:18.325
The dialogue would be as quick as possible so that I would not use the lead into the conversation or the lead out of, just the center of it.

43:19.287 --> 43:25.837
And then describe that before and after so that you don't miss the point of the reason.

43:26.058 --> 43:27.921
You get it.

43:28.161 --> 43:28.842
The cutaway.

43:29.581 --> 43:32.846
is a television technique, not a film technique.

43:32.866 --> 43:34.288
Bang, bang, bang, television.

43:34.949 --> 43:37.513
It's a CNN technique, too.

43:38.775 --> 43:39.956
Not CBS.

43:39.976 --> 43:43.422
CBS did not develop this vocabulary, except for television did not.

43:43.922 --> 43:46.927
The half an hour news jolt with commercials is not cut away.

43:47.147 --> 43:51.594
CNN is cut away because they've got so much time to film.

43:53.256 --> 43:53.817
Certainly.

43:54.337 --> 44:18.117
major consideration for me was that i was only going to use locations that already had appeared in national geographic the head yes they were well covered exotica that i could name as national geographic national geographic in its i have my mother-in-law's collection since 48

44:18.670 --> 44:28.048
has done a heroic job of covering this earth layer upon layer upon layer, era after era, going back to the same places as the epochs change.

44:28.589 --> 44:30.292
I was only using that material.

44:31.073 --> 44:33.578
I would not use something just because I say it's like it's real.

44:33.698 --> 44:36.543
No, I was making sure that it had been covered and covered again.

44:36.563 --> 44:42.214
It's like Kurdistan for when I sent the General Sir Cairo

44:43.139 --> 44:49.406
and not something more, not something that hadn't been covered yet, not a location or a make-believe place.

44:50.508 --> 44:52.690
But this is quite a tech from the Falklands.

44:53.851 --> 44:54.452
Right, right.

44:54.552 --> 44:58.096
I've moved away from... Nobody knew anything about them.

44:58.136 --> 44:58.337
Right.

44:58.377 --> 44:58.917
They were there.

44:59.118 --> 45:03.463
And the reason I used the Falklands was because they're part of the Antarctic protectorate.

45:03.483 --> 45:05.865
I mean, it was really the South Shetlands.

45:05.926 --> 45:08.168
I mean, this is something you find in the books.

45:08.188 --> 45:12.353
But these were techniques that I was going to use for moving the story and making it

45:13.109 --> 45:23.002
making it easy for you to get into and out of, and then the repetition of the Constitution, because that's the civics lesson in here.

45:23.022 --> 45:28.549
But then the presidency itself is developed in a way that when the president does things, your eye knows to read them.

45:30.652 --> 45:34.457
And when things happen in the Oval Office or the White House, your eye knows to read them.

45:35.178 --> 45:41.867
These are dramatic comfort zones for a reader, a crisis.

45:43.450 --> 45:50.038
We are supposed to have ceremonial profundity in this setting.

45:50.098 --> 45:52.101
The trappings of office also include.

45:52.121 --> 45:57.687
That's why I opened with the vice president at Wrigley Field and why he thinks in baseball metaphor.

45:58.528 --> 46:00.010
This is my way of it.

46:00.170 --> 46:06.478
I mean, I made a choice not to use him thinking in war metaphor or football metaphor.

46:06.498 --> 46:10.743
I was attracted to him thinking in baseball metaphor.

46:10.763 --> 46:11.044
It pleased me.

46:11.064 --> 46:13.086
And it pleased me to use...

46:13.454 --> 46:19.823
him thinking in terms of being the pitcher, the starting pitcher.

46:19.843 --> 46:23.468
Just don't leave anything over the plate or that kind of thinking in his own life.

46:23.488 --> 46:33.562
Not because I was condescending towards it, but because I think his genius is to be able to render complicated and sophisticated situations into win or lose, into strike or no strike.

46:33.602 --> 46:38.449
How do you feel about sending this child out?

46:39.273 --> 46:48.125
I think that I, what I really think to myself at that point is, I think of the anecdote of H.C.

46:48.165 --> 47:01.483
Wells in his 80s, in his garden, after five million words in fiction and five million words in non-fiction, mumbling to himself, someday I'll show him, I'm going to write a book, a real book, I'll show him.

47:03.775 --> 47:05.297
That could be the kicker.

47:05.317 --> 47:08.001
I'm always looking for my lead, and I'm always looking for my kicker.

47:08.021 --> 47:09.684
Well, that's what I think of when I write.

47:09.704 --> 47:10.325
How do you feel?

47:10.345 --> 47:11.166
I mean, that's how I feel.

47:11.186 --> 47:12.067
I feel like just H.G.

47:12.107 --> 47:12.368
Wells.

47:12.388 --> 47:13.730
Okay, I'll show those guys.

47:13.810 --> 47:14.411
I'll show them.

47:14.431 --> 47:14.811
I'll show them.

47:14.831 --> 47:16.334
They'll be sorry they said no to them.

47:16.594 --> 47:19.498
Another L&P talk author, Alex Stoole.

47:21.161 --> 47:21.882
A madman.

47:22.723 --> 47:24.045
Delightfully madman.

47:24.065 --> 47:31.476
I'm about to say yes again, if you get to.

47:31.516 --> 47:32.297
And in a room.

47:32.750 --> 47:36.434
I really am writing to get through the next four hours.

47:36.454 --> 47:40.919
I mean, to get as far as I can to get to where I see.

47:42.340 --> 47:46.525
Existentially, what it feels like is that you write the sentence to get to the next sentence.

47:46.545 --> 47:48.647
You write the chapter to get to the next chapter.

47:48.667 --> 47:56.476
You write the first sentence to get to the last one, and then if it's finished, it's inadequate, and you're dissatisfied, and it's insufficient.

47:56.496 --> 48:01.221
And I can remember my favorite anecdote of JPB is

48:02.315 --> 48:04.257
When I'd finished him, Dr. Kinn, I had the galleys.

48:04.297 --> 48:07.180
And I was in my garret, and my friend McCafferty was there.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.623
And one afternoon, Sunday afternoon, they were due the next day.

48:10.664 --> 48:11.585
I was a baby writer.

48:11.945 --> 48:16.270
I'd published one book, but this is Alan and I were doing this under duress style.

48:17.131 --> 48:20.614
And I was reading the galleys, just for mistake.

48:20.634 --> 48:25.960
And my friend McCafferty, because I'd just gotten a television, she brought a television that he'd found on the street that worked.

48:26.750 --> 48:29.173
We were watching it in the corner, and there was a cut.

48:29.193 --> 48:32.656
There was an episode of Starsky and Hotshot, which I'd never seen.

48:32.677 --> 48:33.878
A 70s TV show.

48:33.898 --> 48:40.805
And it was some crazy idea where the serial killer would do Shakespeare characters.

48:41.466 --> 48:45.451
And when he did the murders, he would dress the part and make the speeches.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.275
So they were cornering him, and he was doing McVander Hamlet.

48:49.295 --> 48:55.862
And it was just, just idiotic, but farcical television.

48:56.534 --> 48:59.658
But they were playing a dramatic, and I'm reading Antarctica.

48:59.698 --> 49:00.359
Listen to this.

49:02.241 --> 49:03.743
And I absolutely lost it.

49:04.003 --> 49:04.904
I lost it.

49:05.024 --> 49:07.087
I've written Starsky and Hutch.

49:07.107 --> 49:07.948
That's what this is.

49:10.010 --> 49:10.831
That's all I've got here.

49:11.011 --> 49:13.334
I can't publish this.

49:13.815 --> 49:14.495
It won't work.

49:15.216 --> 49:16.137
Nobody will believe it.

49:16.498 --> 49:21.464
Well, I can remember thinking, while writing anything, Father's Day, anything beyond.

49:21.484 --> 49:22.225
This isn't enough.

49:22.545 --> 49:24.067
This is Starsky and Hutch.

49:24.107 --> 49:24.988
I've done it again.

49:26.082 --> 49:32.011
And that's the feeling, that you have to go on and write another book because you didn't get it right.

49:32.031 --> 49:39.803
Because, you know, someday I'll write something that isn't Star Trek Hutch, that doesn't sound to me like lurid television.

49:39.823 --> 49:46.634
Aren't you pleased that I haven't asked the question, which I thought was a little gratuitous, the word piece.

49:46.654 --> 49:53.625
I mean, the suggestion that it's almost, you should apologize for making a buck on a book, you know.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.546
Oh, no, not only do I not apologize, I want to be the number one sellout in the country.

49:58.606 --> 50:04.133
You know, Robert P. Parker was my guest a few years ago, and I had the paper.

50:04.313 --> 50:09.520
I gave a party for my book reviewers, and he came with my name.

50:09.540 --> 50:13.866
You know, people are all constantly asking me.

50:13.926 --> 50:17.290
If, in other words, somebody would say to me, well, in other words, you've gone commercial.

50:17.611 --> 50:19.453
And he said, no, not in other words.

50:19.493 --> 50:20.695
Those are the precise words.

50:20.715 --> 50:22.397
What?

50:22.597 --> 50:31.571
Well, it's interesting to consider that I... I tell the paradox this way.

50:31.591 --> 50:36.798
If I didn't believe this was real, the money, I thought that that was all lies.

50:36.819 --> 50:40.624
That it was just, you know, hype.

50:40.945 --> 50:48.696
So what I now say to myself, and this is the paradox, is that I used to think there was way too much money for way too few people in publishing.

50:49.277 --> 50:49.718
Now,

50:50.018 --> 50:54.783
I think that there's way too much money to put way too big.

50:54.803 --> 51:12.241
Well, I'll tell you, I'm still pretty angry that Random House gave Magic Johnson $5 million, and gave Harlan Brando $5 million, and gave Colin Powell $4 million, and then they had to kick out little guys like, no, I'd only get 15.

51:12.601 --> 51:14.363
I mean, you didn't want to be there.

51:14.383 --> 51:15.884
No, I couldn't be happier than that.

51:15.904 --> 51:16.485
It's not that.

51:16.505 --> 51:17.646
It's that they are in trouble.

51:17.828 --> 51:19.210
They do not.

51:19.590 --> 51:20.491
They do not.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.974
Random House does not represent good publishing.

51:23.034 --> 51:28.301
Random House has now come to where Doubleday was in the early 80s.

51:28.341 --> 51:32.246
They're where Feynman-Schuster was five years ago.

51:32.626 --> 51:34.508
They are running on empty.

51:34.749 --> 51:36.371
It is a house of cards.

51:37.111 --> 51:38.053
Did you see the books?

51:38.073 --> 51:38.954
I mean, I get the books.

51:38.974 --> 51:40.355
I get the catalogs.

51:40.375 --> 51:41.717
I see everything that they're doing.

51:41.737 --> 51:42.558
It is.

51:42.979 --> 51:44.881
It may not be.

51:44.901 --> 51:46.343
It's on fumes, actually.

51:46.363 --> 51:47.464
I don't even know if it's on empty.

51:48.119 --> 52:00.883
And when it comes, it will be too late, as it always is, as it was for Doubleday, as it was for Simon & Schuster, as well for Morrow, because the chamber for Belgium killed Morrow.

52:02.527 --> 52:04.631
I just want to let it care a lot for Morrow.

52:04.651 --> 52:05.352
Yes.

52:05.956 --> 52:12.345
Well, these are the products of that business.

52:12.365 --> 52:13.446
Except they do like cookbooks.

52:13.466 --> 52:14.768
They get a couple of nice cookbooks.

52:15.569 --> 52:22.899
And it's not as if they give their money to the people who can use it or deserve it or have worked for it or might actually give them another book.

52:23.260 --> 52:29.268
They give their money to people who are already wealthy and it doesn't matter to them and it doesn't have anything to do with books.

52:29.288 --> 52:35.136
I think that in the market terms, what happens is, if I can render it in stock market terms,

52:35.588 --> 52:42.735
What happens at the end is that the excess is the failure.

52:43.976 --> 52:51.944
And that a company that is out of control always, its price goes too high, not too low.

52:54.026 --> 53:01.073
And that is where these companies, I have watched them for 15 years, and Alan and I have always been marginalized.

53:01.998 --> 53:04.402
Now, I thought that that was a negative thing.

53:04.422 --> 53:12.253
It turns out that's safe and secure and extremely traditional to be marginal on American matters.

53:13.114 --> 53:19.023
Because, come the dawn, we're the center.

53:19.043 --> 53:28.738
I remember when Austin O'Neill said to the phone, chatting on the Monday.

53:28.758 --> 53:29.018
Yes.
