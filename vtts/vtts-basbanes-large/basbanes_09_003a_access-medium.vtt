00:03.170 --> 00:06.254
We're talking to Mark Hopin in the opening.

00:06.274 --> 00:16.007
I'm sorry, what did you just say about... I think it was about 81.

00:16.268 --> 00:32.890
That was when I had a uniformity, almost uniformity anyway, practically uniformity of acceptance and lionization by the ruler, such as it was, and

00:33.460 --> 00:37.764
Dudley East was going for $7,500 at that point.

00:38.604 --> 00:53.377
And then after Winter's Tale came out, and although I got magnificent reviews for Winter's Tale, mixed, there's something like that, but a lot of super wonderful.

00:53.517 --> 01:02.725
The fact was that at that point, I no longer was nominated for any prizes ever again.

01:03.177 --> 01:13.932
was completely spit out by whatever the powers that be are, and the way that it embraced me so warmly just a few years before.

01:13.952 --> 01:16.015
I saw you have a Carnegie Hall, and it's like sealed.

01:16.035 --> 01:16.656
You were down.

01:16.977 --> 01:23.146
And the price of the East went from $75 to $100.

01:23.586 --> 01:33.100
At that point, after the article by Chris Buckley in the New York Times, which announced that I was a Republican, the price went down to about $20, $25.

01:34.126 --> 01:38.352
And for Ellis Island in 1981, I received it.

01:38.372 --> 01:39.774
I basically remembered that.

01:39.795 --> 01:40.095
I'm sorry.

01:40.115 --> 01:42.999
I got nominated for the National Book Award.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.583
I got the creative role.

01:45.603 --> 01:50.911
I was given a Guggenheim scholarship.

01:50.931 --> 01:53.615
I was nominated for the Penn Faulkner Award.

01:53.635 --> 01:58.122
And actually, at that time, they gave five, and then they gave the first card.

01:58.142 --> 02:00.145
So in a sense, I got one, but it wasn't the first card.

02:00.265 --> 02:02.749
They'd rather get the first card.

02:04.197 --> 02:17.310
And I remember one person who looked at me at the restaurant during his dinner and sort of winked to indicate that he had fun at the ring.

02:17.330 --> 02:17.611
But anyway.

02:17.631 --> 02:19.072
Now this is for the Madison Book Award?

02:19.092 --> 02:20.253
No, that was at Penn Park.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.595
Penn Park, yeah.

02:22.035 --> 02:23.176
But all of the awards.

02:23.336 --> 02:25.619
Is this for Winter's Tale?

02:25.639 --> 02:26.219
No, for Alice Island.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.443
OK, I'm sorry, I'm... Alice Island got all these awards.

02:30.463 --> 02:33.006
That's the book that I...

02:34.336 --> 02:35.978
Lots of reviews.

02:35.998 --> 02:44.506
That was what I suppose Woody Allen would call the brain cancer.

02:44.526 --> 02:55.377
And then Winchester House came out and it got one of the most incredible reviews ever on the front page of the United Times, which was the quote that I used.

02:55.397 --> 02:55.717
What did he say?

02:55.737 --> 02:57.058
Thank you very much.

02:57.078 --> 03:02.063
While I get looking, I'm going to just check to make sure.

03:02.083 --> 03:02.824
We're on it again.

03:04.913 --> 03:09.538
Do you mind talking about this at all, or this is going to be tough?

03:10.099 --> 03:11.320
I just wanted to mention it to you.

03:11.721 --> 03:13.042
It just came up in conversation.

03:13.102 --> 03:22.794
I'm not particularly... I'd rather not, really, because it's that sort of... I don't know.

03:23.174 --> 03:27.539
Dustin Hoffman complaining that he didn't get an Oscar.

03:27.639 --> 03:31.644
I don't sense that you're complaining about receiving awards.

03:31.664 --> 03:32.625
What I sense is that

03:33.533 --> 03:35.135
You're pointing out a case study.

03:35.596 --> 03:42.286
If your politics are disclosed, it's very easy to be identified as something that had nothing to do with your art.

03:42.807 --> 03:44.149
Is that what you're suggesting?

03:44.169 --> 03:44.429
Exactly.

03:44.449 --> 03:47.814
It's brought up by the fact that you mentioned that it's of the East Coast.

03:47.854 --> 03:48.455
Yeah.

03:48.916 --> 03:51.259
In fact, it's still in there in pencils, and we'll see.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.601
I pulled it out.

03:52.862 --> 03:55.445
That's the only reason I brought that up.

03:55.465 --> 03:58.630
If I thought about that every day, I would be in trouble.

03:58.829 --> 04:04.274
But do you set, I think I'll mention a question, that you have been abandoned by the literary establishment?

04:04.655 --> 04:07.077
No, I've abandoned them.

04:07.097 --> 04:11.321
Really, it was a case of preemption.

04:11.341 --> 04:12.002
And why is that?

04:12.662 --> 04:15.185
I don't know.

04:16.766 --> 04:18.468
I just don't like what has happened.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.331
In general, I started off in a different time.

04:21.351 --> 04:22.732
Standards were different, expectations were different.

04:22.752 --> 04:26.736
And I knew then that it was all coming to an end.

04:26.836 --> 04:28.077
What was coming to an end?

04:28.765 --> 04:47.843
the wealth, the type of, the kind of literary life that existed in America, and perhaps even in the world, that it's going with.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.185
And I'm the preacher of that hero.

04:51.266 --> 04:54.669
Could you just describe it a bit to me?

04:54.689 --> 04:57.912
If you look at it from, let's say, three,

04:58.617 --> 04:59.498
three points of view.

05:00.219 --> 05:08.411
If you look at academic commentary on literature, in my day, the... Well, your day being what?

05:08.591 --> 05:09.092
Meaning what?

05:09.733 --> 05:11.435
Previous... How old would you know?

05:11.455 --> 05:16.843
I'd say you're 40... How old would you know?

05:16.863 --> 05:18.245
Well, we're 48.

05:18.265 --> 05:18.765
48.

05:19.666 --> 05:20.748
I'm just, uh, 48.

05:20.768 --> 05:22.851
We're in the same generation.

05:23.272 --> 05:27.197
Prior to 1965, I went to college.

05:27.217 --> 05:27.898
I was concerned with

05:28.452 --> 05:33.358
with duties and literature.

05:33.378 --> 05:40.067
And I was concerned with the way someone would write, the depth of understanding.

05:40.087 --> 05:44.773
And now, in academia, that's not the case.

05:44.793 --> 05:57.970
They have been taken over by lunatics who judge books by political criteria, by feminist criteria, by who wrote it, the race and sex and class and who wrote it.

05:58.203 --> 06:08.175
by economic criteria, a whole bunch of very odd theory of deconstructionism to the utilitarianism.

06:10.078 --> 06:10.699
That's fine.

06:10.719 --> 06:14.203
I just don't want to miss any of this.

06:15.565 --> 06:16.666
It's too bad.

06:16.686 --> 06:24.275
All these different theories and approaches that are collectively more or less the grand illusion of science.

06:24.295 --> 06:25.817
That's the academic skill.

06:26.278 --> 06:27.940
And that's where one could

06:29.118 --> 06:52.166
I look forward to an anticipate of hope that an academic with a deep interest and understanding in the work would analyze the right book value that you might be taught in colleges because of the quality of the work.

06:52.186 --> 06:53.747
Now, it is in my view of something that's .

06:53.767 --> 06:55.009
That's one factor.

06:55.029 --> 06:58.433
Then there's a second factor, another angle, which is the publishing industry itself.

06:58.970 --> 07:21.233
in what I call my day, in the times that I regret in the past, was self-discipline to the extent that people weren't so eager and so desperate for success and sales that they would jump out and push out anything, anything they agreed.

07:21.253 --> 07:28.200
If you look at the best solos now, you'll see the honors, there are all kinds of things which never could have been published in the 50s.

07:28.788 --> 07:42.561
but it's because there was a code of honor in publishing.

07:43.202 --> 07:47.546
No, people would not publish.

07:47.646 --> 07:48.166
Is it pandering now?

07:48.186 --> 07:57.175
There's the argument where you say, if someone says the publisher is responsible because this is what they give the public, then the other person will say, well, that's what the public wants.

07:57.577 --> 08:06.608
And then if someone says this is what the public wants, then someone says that that's what they're given by the public.

08:06.628 --> 08:07.048
And it's both.

08:07.349 --> 08:08.690
It is a collaboration.

08:08.710 --> 08:14.577
And both of people who read these things, it's like daytime television.

08:14.857 --> 08:20.864
I have a hunger for certain kind of television.

08:21.645 --> 08:23.888
I don't have it because we don't have ourselves.

08:24.880 --> 08:45.507
Sometimes I turn on the television, I get regular old daytime televisions, when I'm really looking for some news that's wrong, but it is now, and I see things on daytime televisions that are really indicative of the fall wrong.

08:45.627 --> 08:54.178
You see, I saw on a daytime television show a woman who, a teenage girl, a girl, 17 or so, who was pregnant,

08:54.884 --> 09:09.343
and came on the show to argue the point that she had a right to do anything she wanted while she was carrying a baby, including taking drugs and drinking and smoking.

09:09.664 --> 09:18.516
And she was on the show, popping a cigarette deliberately at the show.

09:19.737 --> 09:23.322
Now what she was doing was actually humiliating, probably with U.N., her stand-alone child.

09:23.926 --> 09:32.779
in a studio with a television camera going in front of the audience.

09:34.201 --> 09:37.045
It used to be like Rome, and the gladiators, or snuff films.

09:37.065 --> 09:38.187
Snuff films, that's the matter.

09:38.207 --> 09:45.438
It was a deal with demarcation, an absolute demarcation between, I don't know when it happened, sometime in the 60s, before or after.

09:46.159 --> 09:48.763
They would not have had snuff films in 1965.

09:48.783 --> 09:51.807
Snuff films being films where they kill people.

09:51.938 --> 09:53.800
actually killed people.

09:53.820 --> 10:06.792
And there was a snuff film that was shown in Times Square, the movie house in Times Square, until the protests shut it down, and the theater industry threw it out of the movie.

10:07.252 --> 10:11.055
It was not shame, it was kind of shame, simply without present pressure.

10:11.075 --> 10:18.682
But in the era that I was talking about, such things had been possible in America in the public discourse.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.684
But then it became possible.

10:20.704 --> 10:21.625
So publishing,

10:22.128 --> 10:28.757
It has become much like the accidental side.

10:28.837 --> 10:38.489
You cannot look to it for comfort or reassurance.

10:38.509 --> 10:44.757
I can't look to it for what I once really wanted to look for.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.821
I've made the best deal that I can make for myself.

10:47.842 --> 10:52.067
I've tried deliberately to find a publisher who will support me, who reminds me of the older times and I've got one.

10:53.498 --> 11:05.273
But others, in general, I knew there was a field in general, and it was absolutely terrible.

11:05.293 --> 11:07.857
One thing, as a sideline, let me just mention one thing.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.419
I found in the last, that the acceleration of this is geometrical.

11:09.439 --> 11:11.021
It's not that kind of dramatic, it's geometrical.

11:11.041 --> 11:14.646
It's fast, it goes, fast, it goes.

11:14.666 --> 11:19.752
And it's very quickly descended into complete heart.

11:19.772 --> 11:23.337
And I found in the past few years that there's a tendency

11:23.738 --> 11:38.197
in both magazines and book publishing, for your work to be edited without your knowledge of participation.

11:38.217 --> 11:43.304
And then they change it, and there it is, and you really haven't met that.

11:43.324 --> 11:45.366
They go back to the books.

11:45.386 --> 11:46.588
Fiction?

11:46.608 --> 11:50.353
Yeah, and although I was lucky in that,

11:50.789 --> 11:57.697
Some of these things I didn't catch until they were published in the magazine.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.761
With the books, I catch them.

12:03.343 --> 12:06.967
I've caught them.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.009
But I don't want to get into the specifics of it.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.193
And it does not have to do with my publishing.

12:13.514 --> 12:15.657
It's hard work.

12:15.677 --> 12:18.720
But I've had feelings with publishers in which I've had to have been lost in.

12:19.561 --> 12:26.449
Because they want to change the content of the book.

12:27.210 --> 12:34.738
In other words, what's happening is everything is a work for hire.

12:35.098 --> 12:39.664
Except for once, I never did a work for hire.

12:39.684 --> 12:43.968
Work for hire, do you mean doing something on assignment?

12:44.068 --> 12:44.149
No.

12:44.169 --> 12:48.133
A work for hire is where you don't hold a copyright.

12:48.502 --> 12:49.603
They hold a copyright.

12:49.623 --> 12:50.184
It's theirs.

12:50.364 --> 12:55.770
You're just a, like a, like a, like a microphone.

12:55.790 --> 12:56.010
Oh, no, no.

12:56.030 --> 12:56.931
It was an article.

12:57.352 --> 12:57.772
Oh, okay, okay.

12:58.693 --> 13:07.122
And, in fact, that work for Hiring the Reading came out.

13:07.143 --> 13:12.128
It was, it was something that, it was, it was actually from Time Magazine.

13:12.148 --> 13:14.230
They wanted me to do an essay on the Statue of Liberty.

13:14.250 --> 13:14.871
It was a lot of money involved.

13:14.891 --> 13:15.792
It was $20,000 to do an essay.

13:16.244 --> 13:33.764
They were very enthusiastic about it, and so was I because of the money involved.

13:33.784 --> 13:34.405
And I said, I'll do it.

13:34.425 --> 13:34.605
I'm fine.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.846
I can give it to my apartment.

13:35.866 --> 13:38.429
And then I came back to him and told him what I was going to do.

13:38.449 --> 13:39.130
And it dropped me like a hot rock.

13:40.156 --> 13:42.599
It's historically kind of cooperative.

13:42.699 --> 13:45.623
I mean, they did that to Walker Evans and James A.D.

13:45.643 --> 13:46.684
He didn't take it back.

13:46.704 --> 13:55.054
I didn't know that, but they did it in his book, Let Us Now Praise the English Amendment, that was done on assignment for Fortune magazine.

13:55.074 --> 13:57.698
And they just didn't like the tack that he took.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.441
Well, they're right, and they didn't like tack.

14:00.761 --> 14:06.889
I wanted to call the article The Statue of Iacocca because Lee Iacocca was

14:07.443 --> 14:09.866
Oh, he was a major domo in that thing.

14:09.946 --> 14:13.250
Yeah, he was using that thing too.

14:13.270 --> 14:17.374
That's right, I'm just trying to make sure this microphone is pointing.

14:17.394 --> 14:25.163
Put it this way, he got so much publicity out of that that the Statue of Liberty sort of faded into the background.

14:25.183 --> 14:26.685
So I wanted to go to the Statue of Liberty.

14:26.785 --> 14:30.009
But you see, Time, that whole reconstruction was corporate America.

14:30.549 --> 14:30.789
Yeah.

14:30.809 --> 14:33.973
And if you're taking a whack at that, Time Magazine, that's...

14:34.747 --> 14:38.590
Whatever it was, I didn't have the quality time to survive.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.472
And they said, well, you can't.

14:40.492 --> 14:41.733
They said, you can't do that.

14:41.753 --> 14:43.174
And I said, why not?

14:43.194 --> 14:46.337
They said, you can't.

14:46.357 --> 14:46.937
They said, okay.

14:47.037 --> 14:51.441
Did you get a kill thing, just out of curiosity?

14:51.461 --> 14:51.801
I don't remember.

14:51.821 --> 14:52.602
Actually, I actually asked.

14:53.083 --> 14:53.843
I think I did.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.204
I worked for nothing.

14:55.224 --> 14:56.065
Maybe I didn't.

14:56.085 --> 14:59.648
Maybe I didn't even get far enough with it.

14:59.668 --> 15:04.332
But anyway, the tendency now is to...

15:06.286 --> 15:27.625
to treat a writer like an employee, and that there's no one, not no one, but fewer and fewer people respect the idea that what you're doing goes out over your name, and therefore you're choosing to have control.

15:27.785 --> 15:33.170
And it's not a group and collaborative effort.

15:33.190 --> 15:35.432
Now, incidentally, it's very interesting to mention that to me,

15:36.442 --> 15:43.129
In schools, they now teach writers as a kind of group collective effort.

15:43.149 --> 15:43.590
They do.

15:43.690 --> 15:48.315
They have their textbooks, and they say, you have to get together, you have to brainstorm.

15:48.975 --> 15:50.116
They call it the writing process.

15:50.397 --> 15:55.822
You brainstorm, and then you talk about it with other people, decide what you're going to write, clear your idea.

15:56.543 --> 15:59.626
Then you write it, and you submit it to your peers.

16:00.267 --> 16:03.951
It's sort of like a Maoist approach.

16:04.522 --> 16:06.544
And that's how they teach writing in schools now.

16:06.925 --> 16:12.711
The only collaborative effort, as far as I know, that's ever produced a work of literature is the King James Bible.

16:12.731 --> 16:17.115
I mean, that's about, you know, the effort of the Bible.

16:17.135 --> 16:19.117
I mean, that's just many authors, really.

16:19.137 --> 16:26.725
Yeah, but King James was, you know, where they did grow and hire poets and maybe Shakespeare and all the others, and they did do the literary work.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.128
I can't imagine that they're teaching this.

16:30.138 --> 16:31.840
That's how they teach it.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.263
So you must have read Harold Bloom's book.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.125
No, no, I haven't.

16:35.245 --> 16:35.386
Really?

16:35.406 --> 16:37.469
I think you'd enjoy it.

16:38.170 --> 16:42.276
It sounds like the Western canon and the same publisher.

16:42.296 --> 16:43.878
No, I haven't read it.

16:44.359 --> 16:51.849
And I, for reasons that are often left.

16:51.870 --> 16:52.050
Okay.

16:52.490 --> 16:54.433
But, and then I won't even discuss.

16:54.453 --> 16:54.553
Okay.

16:54.573 --> 16:55.194
But I haven't read it.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.256
I don't care.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.057
Well, I haven't read it.

16:58.150 --> 17:02.375
All right, so let's get back to the circle there.

17:02.395 --> 17:15.972
So you have the academic, the scholars, who, of course, there are exceptions, but in general, the point of deception is a little bit more abstract.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.375
And you have the publishing, which is more or less more abstract.

17:18.535 --> 17:27.786
And as a subtext in the academic study, you have the schools where they're teaching them to write collaboratively and collectively

17:28.205 --> 17:44.880
and analyze things according to the principles of deconstruction and race, class, and society, etc.

17:44.900 --> 17:49.184
And then there's a publishing industry which will, does anything so about, and has no standards left.

17:49.204 --> 17:50.905
It will publish just anything, period.

17:50.925 --> 17:56.811
And there's no, it's as if the publishing industry doesn't have its hands shaping the result product.

17:56.831 --> 17:58.212
The product is shaped purely by

17:59.035 --> 18:10.750
by a kind of a rush to do it, to get something out and see itself.

18:10.770 --> 18:23.706
And by the way, you can see that probably that's how it's done compared to what it used to be like, because there's probably many, many, many times more books being published with a scattershot approach.

18:23.726 --> 18:26.389
And with a scattershot approach, you don't have to think about it as much.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.270
You just sort of see that and see which one

18:27.976 --> 18:30.599
They don't even have copy editors anymore.

18:30.619 --> 18:34.624
And they don't have copy editors anymore.

18:34.984 --> 18:35.845
Yeah, absolutely.

18:35.865 --> 18:47.259
And people, when they do get copy editors, I find copy editors copy editing my stuff, which, of course, everyone is editing.

18:47.279 --> 18:54.928
I like good editing, but frequently one is editing and one finds that, and I'm not just talking about anything in particular, but just in general, I write books

18:55.330 --> 19:10.148
articles, free paper articles, introductions, all kinds of things.

19:10.168 --> 19:14.774
You get people who don't know them, or even how to spell.

19:14.794 --> 19:15.595
That's not such a great spell.

19:15.615 --> 19:16.195
And they correct you wrongly.

19:16.215 --> 19:20.941
And they don't know when you win them, but there was a wrong one.

19:20.961 --> 19:23.464
So then there's the third part of it, which is

19:24.406 --> 19:38.361
which is the public itself, which has advised books, but I find myself communicating to academics.

19:38.381 --> 19:47.070
I find that I get my reaction from a somewhat familiar thing, which is individuals who have left.

19:47.090 --> 19:51.675
They sort of sit there with individual violence in this life.

19:51.695 --> 19:52.556
Are there a lot of them, at least?

19:52.576 --> 19:53.957
There are a lot of them.

19:54.494 --> 20:05.269
but they're not supporting them just by definition.

20:06.410 --> 20:07.332
They really can't be.

20:07.352 --> 20:09.034
Just as I would.

20:09.535 --> 20:12.999
I don't like joining organizations except for specific reasons.

20:13.019 --> 20:17.906
Maybe joining the National Authority or joining the North Capitol, but I don't like moving schools and working in the fields.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.408
So, there are exceptions.

20:19.428 --> 20:23.033
And there are a great number of things that they are

20:24.160 --> 20:46.964
I think it used to be that people who had their own image feature used to sell a life of their own.

20:46.984 --> 20:47.585
And now it's less and less.

20:47.605 --> 20:49.888
It's television, because of the pressures, because of the politicization of things that should not be politicized.

20:49.908 --> 20:52.210
And by that, it is the world's art.

20:52.493 --> 21:12.122
for some extent, the world of the family, and the world of everything.

21:12.142 --> 21:18.411
Comics out there with everything too much of the books out there in a very destructive fashion.

21:18.431 --> 21:19.313
But also, the way people look at literature.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.197
There's less chance for an individual to survive.

21:22.480 --> 21:29.486
But anyway, this is a very negative assessment.

21:29.506 --> 21:30.427
I believe it's the truth.

21:30.447 --> 21:34.931
And that's what I mean when I say that the terms have changed.

21:34.951 --> 21:38.234
Is this anger?

21:38.254 --> 21:39.375
Are you angry?

21:39.396 --> 21:42.458
Do you have any sense of anger?

21:43.499 --> 21:43.619
No.

21:43.639 --> 21:48.404
What it is, it's sort of like, it's as if you started to play the game and then they changed the rules.

21:48.424 --> 21:50.265
You know, that's what happened to Mark.

21:51.226 --> 21:51.947
That's what happened to me.

21:52.417 --> 21:56.522
They'll say, okay, I will.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.425
I'll play that in the rules.

21:59.445 --> 22:00.406
But I won't do that.

22:00.426 --> 22:04.410
Not because I'm particularly stubborn, but simply because I don't like you to do it.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.413
What do you think they would like you to do?

22:06.433 --> 22:06.693
Who?

22:07.374 --> 22:07.734
They.

22:08.054 --> 22:10.737
Oh, gosh.

22:10.757 --> 22:13.240
I don't think they'd like me to disappear.

22:13.260 --> 22:13.400
Really?

22:13.580 --> 22:14.021
Yeah.

22:14.321 --> 22:20.228
But other than that, I spoke with everyone who likes to be kinder.

22:20.248 --> 22:20.849
People love Congress.

22:20.869 --> 22:22.170
Let's say that, okay, fine.

22:22.420 --> 22:25.764
So you saw your soul and you can break it.

22:25.985 --> 22:27.306
What would you produce?

22:27.587 --> 22:34.235
I mean, what would you think they would like to see you produce?

22:34.255 --> 22:39.242
I don't know if I'm... I don't know where we're going with the discussion, but I don't think it's interesting.

22:40.123 --> 22:45.210
Well, first I'd be disqualified by the facts of my book.

22:45.730 --> 22:49.175
I don't know what's a... Which facts in particular?

22:49.355 --> 22:50.757
What's a white man's point to produce?

22:51.462 --> 22:54.546
I don't know.

22:54.566 --> 22:57.651
What's a successful white division?

22:57.671 --> 22:59.974
Especially because I could fight and push in 50.

23:00.374 --> 23:00.555
Yeah.

23:00.655 --> 23:02.818
And I'm on the other side of 50 right now.

23:02.838 --> 23:05.401
What was this world that I'm talking about?

23:07.264 --> 23:12.151
What did they want from the fighting?

23:12.171 --> 23:13.593
I don't know.

23:13.613 --> 23:14.254
I don't care.

23:14.855 --> 23:20.102
But I suppose some kind of conversion or repentance.

23:21.213 --> 23:29.921
Are you familiar with the guy named Tim Wegener?

23:30.982 --> 23:32.063
I did a P.O.

23:32.563 --> 23:33.464
interview with him.

23:33.484 --> 23:34.665
He was up in New Hampshire.

23:35.406 --> 23:49.499
His new novel, Novemberfest, is precisely about a guy, a white, middle-aged guy in his 50s, being faced with being too normal, coming too straightforward.

23:49.519 --> 23:49.819
Interesting.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.202
I should send you a copy of that.

23:52.603 --> 23:57.068
He articulates many of the same things.

23:57.088 --> 23:57.549
Go ahead.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.191
I don't even like that.

23:59.391 --> 24:01.554
We should even believe it all the time.

24:01.634 --> 24:01.894
That's right.

24:02.294 --> 24:05.859
Because I don't like the idea that I'm a victim.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.963
I don't consider myself a victim.

24:08.983 --> 24:09.563
Is that the thing?

24:09.583 --> 24:10.044
I'm not a victim.

24:11.185 --> 24:16.572
And I don't like the idea that, for instance, there's a reaction to feminism.

24:16.592 --> 24:18.815
Men's clothes.

24:18.835 --> 24:19.215
People make things.

24:19.853 --> 24:24.579
Do you want to join a ministry?

24:24.599 --> 24:26.140
I'd rather die than join a ministry.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.244
I'd literally rather die than join a ministry.

24:29.264 --> 24:31.747
Do you remember Leonard Michael's little novel, The Men's Club?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.050
I remember when it came out, yeah.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.473
I remember that the New York Times would kill him.

24:36.493 --> 24:42.440
I mean, the New York Times Magazine asked me to write their column, or to contribute to their column called About Men.

24:43.841 --> 24:45.183
And I said, I won't do that.

24:45.203 --> 24:47.886
And they were like, About Men?

24:49.537 --> 24:50.398
That's right.

24:50.498 --> 24:52.781
You said that you write a newspaper for whom?

24:53.322 --> 24:54.143
The Wall Street Journal.

24:54.163 --> 24:54.584
You do?

24:54.944 --> 24:57.909
Oh, yeah.

24:57.989 --> 24:58.509
How often?

24:58.569 --> 25:00.152
Well, it's an occasional call.

25:00.452 --> 25:02.915
Really?

25:03.496 --> 25:05.499
Oh, yeah.

25:09.444 --> 25:15.713
See, I got some background to get here.

25:18.697 --> 25:37.961
This was on the day that the Congress came out.

25:37.981 --> 25:38.461
It's about Haiti.

25:38.481 --> 25:44.168
It's about diversity.

25:44.188 --> 25:45.310
It's about security and policy.

25:45.330 --> 25:47.893
This is about a lecture called Against the Dehumanization of Art.

25:49.443 --> 26:04.006
So you have, obviously, without having read these pretty strong political views then, I guess.

26:04.267 --> 26:06.931
Oh, yeah.

26:09.015 --> 26:13.662
So do you sense then that because, you know, even though you're two different people,

26:14.418 --> 26:20.385
That your fiction is going to be maligned because of a perception of yours as a certain point?

26:20.405 --> 26:21.026
Well, wait a minute.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.368
Let's not really finish.

26:22.388 --> 26:24.330
I can't think two things away.

26:25.251 --> 26:29.556
This is my Achilles heel.

26:29.577 --> 26:31.158
But I didn't do the headline.

26:31.178 --> 26:35.744
That's Why Bush Will Win by Mark Halpern, October 27, 1992, Wall Street Journal.

26:36.785 --> 26:39.008
On the other hand, that's the only thing.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.002
And this is you, too?

26:41.042 --> 26:44.668
I dodged the draft, and I was wrong, October 16, 1992?

26:44.688 --> 26:46.350
That was the speech that I got at West Point.

26:48.313 --> 26:50.036
Did you dodge the draft?

26:50.056 --> 26:51.478
No, that was the headline, too.

26:51.638 --> 26:56.786
I didn't really dodge the draft, and I didn't serve in the American Army.

26:56.806 --> 27:00.752
Anyway, that was about the Republican Convention.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.156
Kids can kill you, can't they?

27:03.176 --> 27:04.778
Headlines.

27:05.159 --> 27:07.763
People think that the author writes the headline, too, which is

27:08.435 --> 27:10.217
That's fine.

27:10.237 --> 27:14.281
That's on the New Hampshire primary.

27:16.143 --> 27:17.345
Are you enjoying your journalism?

27:17.825 --> 27:18.926
Oh, yeah.

27:18.946 --> 27:21.629
This is Yugoslavia, a military analysis.

27:21.649 --> 27:27.436
That's a nuclear unsigned Victorian journal.

27:27.456 --> 27:30.018
There's the Israeli military.

27:30.038 --> 27:34.723
This is the Gulf War analysis.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.265
Gulf War analysis.

27:36.285 --> 27:38.087
So you've been doing this since... Gulf War analysis.

27:40.683 --> 27:41.664
Gulf War analysis.

27:41.724 --> 27:42.726
At least four years.

27:44.748 --> 27:45.109
See this?

27:45.169 --> 27:46.971
Iraq, the military analysis.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.975
This was Friday, December 7, 1990.

27:51.357 --> 27:58.747
If you read this, you'll see that this is the history of the war, but before the war happened.

28:00.148 --> 28:03.292
Did you project that they'd let Saddam Hussein?

28:03.413 --> 28:06.837
No, because what I did was I urged them to go all the way back.

28:07.057 --> 28:10.622
But that's the only thing that the end game, they didn't do.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.377
the way I told them to.

28:12.918 --> 28:16.663
Not that they did what I told them to, but the endgame didn't come out as I predicted.

28:17.143 --> 28:17.884
And they were reading it.

28:17.944 --> 28:21.429
I know that they were reading it.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.390
Bush's budget deal.

28:23.772 --> 28:27.717
This was predicting the Soviet coup, and it wasn't accurate.

28:27.817 --> 28:31.282
October 2, 1990.

28:32.884 --> 28:40.474
This was about hostage-taking and war crime, and shortly after, two weeks after,

28:40.775 --> 28:45.861
In fact, they did what I suggested.

28:45.921 --> 28:48.745
I wrote this actually the day that saw him.

28:48.765 --> 28:52.349
And everyone was saying, oh, we missed nothing to do.

28:52.389 --> 28:55.793
We can't do anything.

28:55.813 --> 29:00.959
My gulf pieces were the most precise and predictive.

29:00.979 --> 29:08.048
This was predicting Gorbachev's demise and the rise of the right in Russia.

29:10.981 --> 29:22.398
It's been about five years you've been doing this, no?

29:22.458 --> 29:31.331
I don't know, did that say 86?

29:32.112 --> 29:37.180
I blew it on the 92 election.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.503
And I was doing it just because I sort of fell on my sword.

29:40.360 --> 29:45.646
But you predicted Bush would win re-election, right?

29:46.107 --> 29:47.608
Yeah.

29:47.628 --> 29:51.272
Well, I knew that it was a tight one, but it was very close to that point.

29:51.293 --> 29:54.616
It was pretty much harder, though, I think, until the end.

29:54.977 --> 29:55.918
I don't know if it was close.

29:56.298 --> 30:06.109
He had a surge at the end.

30:06.650 --> 30:10.114
This one, when Bush was behind in the polls by

30:11.039 --> 30:13.802
at the Democratic Convention.

30:13.922 --> 30:15.364
Yeah, that was funny, though.

30:15.384 --> 30:18.107
Many, many, many, many, many points.

30:18.628 --> 30:22.833
Yeah, but nobody, everyone was saying... He closed that in a day.

30:23.453 --> 30:33.805
No, no, no, it took more than a day, but at that point, I was the only journalist who would say that.

30:33.825 --> 30:38.831
And then there's this... Are you enjoying this as much as your fiction?

30:39.011 --> 30:39.612
Yeah, I do.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.681
See, I mean, and it goes back.

30:41.781 --> 30:45.205
We're back in 85, 85.

30:45.225 --> 30:48.047
Well, that's just like 10 years then, doesn't it?

30:48.067 --> 30:48.207
Yeah.

30:48.227 --> 30:56.635
It is 10 years.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.898
The first newspaper article was in the 1980s at the Times.

30:59.918 --> 31:08.667
But, really, I mean... For 10 years, isn't it?

31:08.687 --> 31:10.088
For the interviews, which is it?

31:11.063 --> 31:19.034
despite this, with some people's contention, I cannot tell anything but the truth in an interview.

31:19.055 --> 31:31.953
I can make up stories for books, but when you think an interviewer comes, I'm not politically a politician.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.916
And if you ask me a question, it's absolutely a straight answer.

31:35.538 --> 31:38.843
Even if it's damaging, as has happened at a time,

31:39.565 --> 31:40.787
You see, it's interesting.

31:40.927 --> 31:44.311
I've been reading books professionally for a long time.

31:46.194 --> 31:53.824
Maybe I'm naive, and I don't read, I confess, I don't get the journal out of it.

31:53.844 --> 31:58.651
It's as great a newspaper as it is.

31:58.871 --> 32:03.618
But now that you mention it, I do remember the Christopher Buckley piece daily.

32:03.938 --> 32:06.702
And so, gee, Mark Coughlin, the Republicans.

32:06.802 --> 32:07.463
I forgot about it.

32:07.831 --> 32:13.636
I continue to read you with pleasure, and I am able, you know, my politics are quite irrelevant, you know.

32:13.876 --> 32:21.423
I think probably... And my politician on the stand was Jane Files, and I was mad at him for Vietnam stuff.

32:21.583 --> 32:22.884
Oh, I continue to read that.

32:22.944 --> 32:30.331
I served in the aircraft carrier in Vietnam twice, and I mean... Nonetheless, she's a great actor.

32:30.351 --> 32:33.373
That's funny, but it's one thing to say the war is wrong.

32:33.433 --> 32:37.517
It's another thing to call for the... She went beyond this.

32:37.919 --> 32:39.901
I mean, I knew pilots, you know.

32:40.341 --> 32:41.122
I checked out.

32:41.162 --> 32:42.724
I mean, she called for that.

32:42.784 --> 32:47.488
I mean, she advocated the killing of Americans into that.

32:47.508 --> 32:48.969
And they continue to commit me.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.151
Never forgive her for that.

32:51.412 --> 32:56.516
But she's a wonderful actress, I think.

32:56.697 --> 32:56.937
Yeah.

32:56.957 --> 32:58.218
I mean, she's a terrific actress.

32:58.238 --> 33:01.601
I wouldn't boycott the film.

33:01.621 --> 33:07.707
But that's, and I think that that's, unfortunately, now, that kind of attitude is

33:08.024 --> 33:14.393
People don't separate things properly.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.499
So this apparently is a problem then, I guess.

33:19.821 --> 33:20.061
No.

33:20.281 --> 33:23.145
You aren't perceived as politically correct.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.988
That's not a problem.

33:25.008 --> 33:26.130
That's an art.

33:26.210 --> 33:27.111
And it's not a problem.

33:27.191 --> 33:31.958
But I mean in terms of the literary, quotation marks, establishment.

33:31.998 --> 33:35.643
You said that they abandoned you and you abandoned them.

33:35.663 --> 33:37.626
That's true.

33:37.859 --> 33:47.610
But you also suggest that this has damaged the reception that your books get and receive.

33:47.710 --> 33:49.271
I think so.

33:49.291 --> 33:52.855
But they're not reviewed on their merits, on their limiting merits.

33:52.915 --> 33:54.757
Well, I think that's absolutely true.

33:54.777 --> 33:58.201
And I guess maybe this might make the departure too.

33:58.301 --> 34:02.766
That's absolutely something to mention in the New York Times book review.

34:02.786 --> 34:06.330
Well, Becky's gone now, too, so that might help.

34:06.648 --> 34:08.691
That's not the record for me, too.

34:08.711 --> 34:12.817
I mean, I've said this many times.

34:12.837 --> 34:26.117
In the front page review that I got for Soldier of the Great War, the first sentence said that I'm a Republican.

34:26.137 --> 34:28.520
I wrote a book about an Italian in the First World War.

34:28.540 --> 34:33.688
And on the front page of the New York Times, the review of the first sentence, it points out the fact that I'm a Republican.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.130
What about the review?

34:35.150 --> 34:36.452
Thomas G. Miller.

34:37.478 --> 34:39.420
You know, I'm not making it up.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.844
Did he stab it to the book?

34:42.864 --> 34:43.725
No, he didn't break it up.

34:43.745 --> 34:52.014
But, let me just read through the... Oh, no.

34:52.034 --> 35:03.527
Don't worry, we are going to talk about the book.

35:03.547 --> 35:06.490
Well, let me come here so I can get it on the table.

35:10.300 --> 35:18.149
In the late 20th century, where do you fit a writer who has described himself as a, quote, Roosevelt Republican, end quote, Teddy Roosevelt, that is?

35:18.650 --> 35:19.631
He has a big stick.

35:21.193 --> 35:22.915
That's a first sentence.

35:22.935 --> 35:25.358
Sure, that's May 5th, 91.

35:29.122 --> 35:30.684
It's a first sentence.

35:30.704 --> 35:31.745
Is that a copy, by the way?

35:32.727 --> 35:33.888
Is that a copy of that review?

35:34.389 --> 35:35.730
Do you have multiple copies of that?

35:36.031 --> 35:38.113
I can't give, I can make a copy of it.

35:39.865 --> 35:43.129
I use it for record, but would you like to help you?

35:43.209 --> 35:44.711
I'll get one from Duke.

35:44.751 --> 35:45.152
That's fine.

35:45.172 --> 35:50.919
If you had one, I'd take it, but I'll... I have access.

35:50.939 --> 35:52.582
No problem.

35:52.602 --> 36:09.163
I mean, my question that I ask is in my Paris Review interview, which actually, if you want to... All this... Everything that you're talking about, you can get in condensed written form in Paris Review interview, which is there...

36:12.535 --> 36:17.124
Here it is.

36:17.144 --> 36:18.526
I'm sorry, I can't give it to you.

36:18.546 --> 36:18.807
That's fine.

36:18.827 --> 36:21.532
I can give you a copy, maybe, if I can find a copy of it.

36:21.552 --> 36:22.173
Would you like it?

36:22.193 --> 36:22.855
Yeah, I'd love that.

36:23.456 --> 36:24.959
Maybe you can mail it to me.

36:24.979 --> 36:25.780
I'll give you my card.

36:26.882 --> 36:28.165
I might have an extra copy.

36:29.607 --> 36:30.589
Let me give you an extra copy.

36:30.609 --> 36:33.455
Or you can let me borrow it and copy it, and I'd mail it back to you, you know?

36:34.216 --> 36:35.218
Let me look and see if I can.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.043
Well, let's just turn abruptly.

36:41.263 --> 36:44.025
As I said, I just want to finish.

36:44.045 --> 36:54.435
I said, in New York Times, in a review of Ancient Evenings, would they mention the first sentence of Norman Miller as a Democrat?

36:54.935 --> 37:05.564
But, you know, honestly, I'm not, we're just, we've got economists, but it's not what I'm particularly concerned about.

37:06.185 --> 37:06.285
Okay.

37:09.117 --> 37:12.982
Well, let's just turn.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.027
How many years is this between novels now, or is this about four years, right?

37:19.750 --> 37:20.732
Yes, exactly.

37:20.752 --> 37:27.380
So is there any apprehension on your part about the reception of the book?

37:27.861 --> 37:29.643
I mean, I read it, and it's delightful.

37:32.246 --> 37:34.689
Apprehension.

37:34.709 --> 37:35.630
Apprehension, yeah.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.673
I mean, we've actually spent an hour quite unexpectedly talking

37:37.838 --> 37:41.662
And it's my fault, I guess, this following, because it's a fascinating discussion.

37:42.824 --> 37:48.570
But about things that have nothing to do with a literary work.

37:49.331 --> 37:49.611
Right.

37:49.632 --> 37:54.077
Apprehension, no.

37:54.257 --> 37:55.098
Absolutely no apprehension whatsoever.

37:55.638 --> 37:55.839
You can't.

37:55.859 --> 37:57.120
Please don't follow me.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.122
But frankly, I don't give a fuck.

38:00.063 --> 38:00.944
My language is fine.

38:02.386 --> 38:03.227
I can't close you.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.048
Don't worry about it.

38:05.598 --> 38:07.801
That's just messy or anything.

38:07.821 --> 38:09.744
That's fine.

38:10.705 --> 38:23.842
To go back to the very first thing you said, I mean, that you came from a time and your heritage is where beauty and literature is what concerned you.

38:25.445 --> 38:27.387
Let's talk about that.

38:27.427 --> 38:34.677
I mean, this is your mandate, I gather, to try and produce in your work is what you...

38:35.416 --> 38:43.005
hope to be duty.

38:43.145 --> 38:53.839
I mean, that's a general throw-out statement.

38:53.859 --> 38:56.262
Maybe you can take it anywhere you want to.

38:56.282 --> 38:57.803
That's why I'm in business.

38:57.823 --> 39:01.228
To make that which is beautiful.

39:01.248 --> 39:01.748
And that's why I do this.

39:01.768 --> 39:02.189
That's what Kim said.

39:02.209 --> 39:02.409
That's it.

39:02.429 --> 39:04.832
And this book is not the same as the previous book.

39:05.605 --> 39:09.990
in a degree.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.672
The same in what respect?

39:11.692 --> 39:12.192
The same in your respect.

39:12.212 --> 39:15.656
The other one was, the last one, Soul to the Great World was like the main course.

39:15.676 --> 39:17.718
This is kind of like a dessert.

39:17.738 --> 39:18.840
I eased up a bit.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.022
It's more contemporary.

39:21.282 --> 39:28.050
I haven't finished it.

39:28.070 --> 39:28.971
Forgive me.

39:28.991 --> 39:30.473
Nonetheless.

39:30.493 --> 39:34.397
But I shall try it to the wedding of the piece.

39:35.643 --> 39:41.890
It's the same, it's much the same, only it's just lighter and toned.

39:41.910 --> 39:42.471
It's funny.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.033
It's funny.

39:44.053 --> 39:46.136
The other one's not primarily funny.

39:46.636 --> 39:46.816
No.

39:46.836 --> 39:48.458
The last one.

39:48.478 --> 39:52.303
This one's funny.

39:52.323 --> 39:56.808
Where does this character come from, I guess?

39:59.011 --> 39:59.512
From Rossini.

39:59.532 --> 39:59.712
Yeah.

39:59.732 --> 40:01.654
I mean, where does he come from?

40:01.674 --> 40:04.097
I don't mean literally, but I mean...

40:07.300 --> 40:11.926
How did one create a character with so many facets?

40:15.310 --> 40:18.454
I don't know.

40:18.474 --> 40:19.796
You know, I'm rather amazed that you hadn't asked me about coffee.

40:19.816 --> 40:20.577
I'm an old label officer.

40:20.597 --> 40:21.798
I can't believe it.

40:21.818 --> 40:23.761
Do you not drink coffee, by the way?

40:24.001 --> 40:25.543
Do you detest coffee?

40:25.563 --> 40:33.713
I've never had a cup of coffee in my life, but I'm not like my protagonist.

40:34.942 --> 40:38.326
I assumed that you didn't drink coffee.

40:38.386 --> 40:43.971
I assumed that this was an expression of your own.

40:44.051 --> 40:45.553
No, it's not.

40:45.573 --> 41:04.813
The other thing is that these days, very often writers are so impoverished that all they can do is put their own little political program or particular obsession, whether it be politics or feminism or race or patriotic coffee.

41:05.198 --> 41:15.635
Essentially, they've subordinated the art of fiction to whatever program they believe in.

41:15.655 --> 41:17.698
And I don't believe in that, and I haven't done it.

41:17.718 --> 41:30.538
So this is not a diatribe against coffee, although the character doesn't buy coffee.

41:30.558 --> 41:30.879
I don't like it.

41:30.899 --> 41:31.780
And it's easy for me to write his diatribes.

41:31.996 --> 41:37.584
but I don't believe that coffee causes cancer.

41:37.604 --> 41:38.746
Well, I probably may.

41:39.446 --> 41:41.830
But even if it does, there's obviously not much of a quarrel.

41:41.850 --> 41:43.833
See, I'm a very, I suspend things.

41:43.853 --> 41:47.077
It doesn't bother me one way or the other what the guy thinks about.

41:47.097 --> 41:49.300
I mean, I personally can't live without it, you know.

41:49.401 --> 41:50.242
I go the other way.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.688
I need caffeine in the morning.

41:54.708 --> 41:58.273
I can drink a pot of coffee by noon, you know.

41:59.165 --> 42:04.253
One of the reasons I had to use your facility so quickly is I had a, you know, a good sized mug of it on the way out.

42:05.115 --> 42:06.136
Did you drive it?

42:06.156 --> 42:06.437
Yeah.

42:07.519 --> 42:08.941
Oh, you're hooked.

42:09.121 --> 42:22.964
Oh, I am hooked, but it's better than being hooked on tobacco, you know, or anything else.

42:22.984 --> 42:23.084
Sure.

42:23.104 --> 42:24.567
It's, you know, the caffeine is a drug that you contact yourself.

42:24.587 --> 42:25.408
You get more and more and more.

42:26.097 --> 42:31.063
If you take too much in too short a period, it can really have very deleterious effects.

42:31.203 --> 42:32.725
It can kill you.

42:32.745 --> 42:35.989
For instance, about 45 cups of coffee, you're going.

42:36.009 --> 42:39.894
But you wouldn't drink 45 cups of coffee all at once, would you?

42:39.974 --> 42:41.516
No, I don't think so.

42:41.536 --> 42:46.242
But I'd probably drink six or eight cups in a day.

42:46.883 --> 42:49.065
I'd have a lot.

42:49.126 --> 42:49.886
That's heavy.

42:49.906 --> 42:54.152
And when I was on the ship, God knows how much I'd drink, because your hours were crazy.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.193
You'd stand to watch.

42:55.814 --> 43:07.629
You know, four to eight, wide shot, back in the air, just to be drinking coffee at times?

43:07.649 --> 43:22.969
My question about any kind of Japanese, whether coffee, tea, or you still need, is if your heart says it wants to rest, and it wants to beat at 60 beats a minute, and you don't give it the message that it should beat more by exercising, by moving around,

43:23.455 --> 43:31.603
Rather, you're sitting here working at your desk or something, and your heart says, I want to rest now.

43:31.623 --> 43:32.284
You want to go 60 beats a minute.

43:32.304 --> 43:39.311
You drink coffee, and the caffeine chemically makes the heart beat at 90 beats a minute so that you feel better.

43:40.112 --> 43:43.895
It's because it's almost like you're exercising.

43:43.915 --> 43:45.978
Is that a good thing?

43:45.998 --> 43:47.699
I mean, can that possibly be good for the heart?

43:47.719 --> 43:53.445
Isn't that sort of like waking you up in the middle of the night when you're deep asleep and saying, okay, do this, do that.

43:54.235 --> 44:00.544
I know that I'm a deadline kind of a person, and I really do.

44:01.205 --> 44:09.476
I need, even if they're imposed, I don't know if I impose them on myself, I need just a little bit of pressure to produce work.

44:09.496 --> 44:18.849
And coffee seems to be part of the way I focus my energies on working.

44:18.869 --> 44:22.234
I find I don't drink as much coffee when I'm not working.

44:23.041 --> 44:39.143
I don't know if that means anything, but... I just wonder about how... I don't think it has much to do with cancer, but I really wonder about the heart.

44:39.163 --> 44:40.344
I mean, after all, industrial democracy, heart diseases.

44:40.364 --> 44:46.252
Of course, smoking and pollution and all these other things.

44:46.272 --> 44:48.475
I wonder about... I used to smoke cigars.

44:48.826 --> 44:55.094
And I gave them up when it was absolutely apparent that I had a dependence on them, you know.

44:55.775 --> 44:56.756
I couldn't wait to get out.

44:56.776 --> 44:58.839
I was like running away.

44:58.859 --> 45:01.883
You couldn't smoke anywhere, you know.

45:01.983 --> 45:07.870
So I couldn't wait to get in my car and drive to work and light up the cigar, you know.

45:07.890 --> 45:10.994
And I'd smoke them for 20 years.

45:11.014 --> 45:14.359
And I just gave them up one day about eight years ago and haven't touched them since.

45:14.559 --> 45:16.341
You know, my father did exactly that.

45:16.361 --> 45:17.803
He smoked for...

45:18.897 --> 45:21.822
60 years.

45:21.962 --> 45:24.526
I stopped on a Christmas day.

45:24.546 --> 45:30.755
I remember my brother gave me a nice Havana snack with breakfast dinner at his house and I said, this is my last one.

45:30.775 --> 45:33.259
And he smokes, you know, and I appreciated it.

45:33.279 --> 45:34.842
And you just... And I did.

45:35.302 --> 45:38.648
Yeah, and I have to say, you know, I can't, I don't think about them.

45:38.668 --> 45:39.409
Thank you.

45:39.829 --> 45:40.510
I'll call it.

45:40.911 --> 45:42.173
I can call it.

45:42.313 --> 45:43.675
I just request it.

45:43.695 --> 45:44.417
That's fine.

45:44.817 --> 45:46.660
I do the same thing with Dietrich.

45:47.821 --> 45:49.743
I was drinking a lot of diet caffeine tea coke.

45:50.184 --> 45:51.626
I was drinking it like water.

45:52.287 --> 45:58.915
And my wife said to me, you're an addict.

45:58.935 --> 45:59.596
And I said, I am.

45:59.616 --> 46:02.159
I just want to tell her to stop.

46:02.179 --> 46:09.669
I haven't had it in a year.

46:10.430 --> 46:13.614
So you're, let's start talking about books and literature now.

46:15.096 --> 46:15.897
If we can.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.659
By the way, everything that we talked about,

46:18.533 --> 46:22.958
He's right in there.

46:22.978 --> 46:25.521
I'm sorry, I didn't know that piece.

46:26.802 --> 46:31.788
You don't mind if I use some of the things out of there?

46:31.848 --> 46:31.988
No.

46:32.109 --> 46:42.220
I wanted that to be the relaxed, sort of contentious type of thing.

46:42.320 --> 46:46.885
I didn't know about this, by the way, so this happened at this point.

46:46.905 --> 46:48.287
Trust me on this.

46:48.672 --> 46:59.006
No, it developed out of a sound organization, and I'm professional enough to know that something's happening here, and just let it go, and you just follow the lead.

46:59.026 --> 47:04.292
Yeah, I just let it play, and it is fascinating, but still, it's not the lead for me.

47:04.793 --> 47:16.789
You know, I do write a literary poem that's published now in 22 newspapers, and I syndicated it myself, and I'm largely university, which does not have to be on tape.

47:16.889 --> 47:17.650
Yeah, but...

47:20.650 --> 47:22.852
So you're 48 or about to be 48.

47:24.013 --> 47:28.658
You've got, you've had collections of stories, what, four novels, three novels now?

47:29.299 --> 47:36.606
Two, Fire, Fire, Two's Tale, Sword of the Great War is the fourth novel.

47:36.626 --> 47:36.726
Yeah.

47:36.746 --> 47:42.491
And I've had two collections of stories and one children's book.

47:42.512 --> 47:43.613
Which I have with me, by the way.

47:44.333 --> 47:45.014
I have two girls.

47:45.374 --> 47:46.275
I have two girls.

47:46.295 --> 47:47.296
Signed it for me.

47:47.316 --> 47:49.138
I was in 89 and I've been waiting to have

47:49.591 --> 47:52.554
That's a rare one.

47:52.814 --> 47:57.799
There are very few that both he and I have thought about book stuff.

47:57.819 --> 47:59.160
I mean, there are billions of them.

47:59.220 --> 48:04.405
They printed, I think they printed 300,000 of them.

48:04.425 --> 48:05.647
It's a wonderful book.

48:05.807 --> 48:09.230
And 200,000,000 sold.

48:09.811 --> 48:14.475
But I know what, 200,000,000 sold.

48:14.495 --> 48:17.959
They had a lot left over.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.480
Oh, that was years ago.

48:19.898 --> 48:26.528
But I signed, well, I must have signed 1,000, 2,000 of them.

48:27.189 --> 48:28.711
And he probably signed that many, too.

48:30.394 --> 48:37.525
But it was very rare that we had visited one person, which was... In fact, he signed a poster for me, which I have in my younger guys.

48:38.626 --> 48:39.788
Which poster was it?

48:39.808 --> 48:41.711
This one, my poster.

48:42.673 --> 48:43.113
Delightful.

48:44.716 --> 48:46.579
He was a good interviewer.

48:46.599 --> 48:48.201
That was an interesting collaboration, wasn't it?

48:48.772 --> 48:50.914
He's so wonderful.

48:50.934 --> 48:56.839
He has a temperament of a saint.

48:56.859 --> 48:57.459
He is very gentle.

48:57.980 --> 49:03.424
Even, gentle, having been not disturbed by him.

49:03.444 --> 49:07.668
This is a guy who has tremendous, tremendous benevolence, just a wild brand.

49:07.688 --> 49:18.097
You know, it's interesting, going back to how we started, his art certainly is compatible with your vision of literature, isn't it?

49:18.117 --> 49:18.677
Very traditional.

49:19.248 --> 49:20.910
beautiful.

49:20.990 --> 49:38.132
What it is, I remember I mentioned something, I mentioned, as my old English teacher used to say, people who live their own lives, a life of their own, they live a life of their own, meaning that they're not, essentially I suppose what you're saying, what we're saying is they're not externally motivated.

49:39.133 --> 49:41.756
And Chris is the perfect paradigm of that.

49:41.776 --> 49:48.765
And what you get along with that is the ability to concentrate very deeply

49:49.117 --> 49:53.764
That's what I do too.

49:55.306 --> 50:09.226
I concentrate very deeply on the subject at hand, on the question at hand, and I go where I go according to where it seems I should go, not according to external stimuli.

50:09.426 --> 50:16.656
That's where the trouble we were talking about arises, the trouble at the beginning of the interview.

50:16.797 --> 50:17.858
That's where I have

50:20.251 --> 50:24.958
because they don't operate according to external stimuli.

50:24.978 --> 50:27.241
I operate according to internal stimuli.

50:27.261 --> 50:38.237
The funny thing about that is that if you carry that to an extreme, then you have total dysfunction in the old student.

50:38.257 --> 50:41.642
For instance, a psychotic doesn't react to stimuli.

50:42.503 --> 50:45.307
It just goes straight track, whatever it takes.

50:46.368 --> 50:48.992
So that you have to learn to control

50:49.799 --> 50:54.183
that your concentration otherwise would be lost in it.

50:54.203 --> 51:01.591
So that you do have to learn to live in the world socially and pay some attention to these external stimuli.

51:01.611 --> 51:12.081
But the way that you do it, you can shield what you're doing in your soul by being very protective of it.

51:12.101 --> 51:18.287
And yet at the same time, if you don't want to completely derail and go off into obsession or insanity,

51:19.212 --> 51:23.616
you have to also be aware of what's going on in the rest of the world.

51:23.636 --> 51:26.158
So, to get back, so we said six books.

51:26.639 --> 51:30.722
May I just... I'm sorry, I think it's done.

51:30.843 --> 51:46.857
In the Amproof case, the protagonist, who has no name, whose name, the first name that we hear is Austin, which is not his name, but he is a very good example of carrying

51:48.355 --> 51:50.418
Because anything is making sure.

51:50.438 --> 52:17.012
What I'm talking about, almost actually beyond the limits, you see, you haven't finished the book, I don't know where you are in the book, but what he does is, he does carry it beyond the limits to the point where he eliminates everybody, to where he kills, to where he goes beyond the bounds.

52:17.353 --> 52:17.653
Utrecht.

52:18.511 --> 52:20.734
becomes criminal.

52:20.754 --> 52:26.482
But when you finish it, you'll see that he has a very good reason to do so.

52:26.502 --> 52:28.725
At many levels.

52:28.745 --> 52:31.489
But that's essentially what I was talking about.

52:31.509 --> 52:36.656
And I've been disturbed by the first part of the conversation thinking to myself, why?

52:36.676 --> 52:37.557
Don't worry about it.

52:37.617 --> 52:39.320
But I'm still thinking, what?

52:39.340 --> 52:41.863
No, don't worry about it.

52:41.943 --> 52:43.946
Again, we've got 800 words and 1,000 words.

52:43.966 --> 52:44.647
I don't want to.

52:45.048 --> 52:46.830
If my readers are interested in books,

52:47.958 --> 52:50.462
My column appears in cities where people buy books.

52:52.705 --> 52:55.930
That's really what we're here to do.

52:55.950 --> 52:57.352
It's my job to read the book.

52:59.916 --> 53:01.699
Forgive me if I don't ask you about the book.

53:01.739 --> 53:08.650
I have a responsibility to read it and to interpret it.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.573
There may be certain technical things.

53:10.593 --> 53:16.041
Is this book driven by the character or by the story?

53:16.375 --> 53:31.930
These are things they might like to talk about, but, you know, the other stuff is interesting, you know, but I've got to budget my words, and where that goes, and how much of it we'll use, we'll really pale.

53:32.150 --> 53:38.436
No, no, I'm not trying to ask you to... You want to talk about the book, and I agree, I do too.

53:38.456 --> 53:41.539
I was thinking about myself.

53:41.559 --> 53:42.180
Why did I...

53:43.358 --> 53:44.320
What is it?

53:44.420 --> 53:46.465
Why did I fall into that?

53:46.485 --> 53:49.531
And now I wanted to analyze it.

53:49.752 --> 53:51.596
I didn't set it up because I didn't know it.

53:51.616 --> 53:52.037
Trust me.

53:52.057 --> 53:53.540
No, no, no.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.624
Why did I do that?

53:55.765 --> 53:58.531
And now I understand.

53:58.551 --> 53:59.713
I think this is where you can tell me.
