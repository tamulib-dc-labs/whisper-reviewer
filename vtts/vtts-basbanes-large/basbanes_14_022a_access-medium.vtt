00:03.187 --> 00:09.755
There are new archive buildings in the world?

00:09.775 --> 00:13.400
Well, Canadians just opened the new Presbyterian Center last year.

00:13.420 --> 00:17.005
The public record office in North Britain has a new building.

00:17.886 --> 00:31.523
The, um, well, one of the ironies is the Bundesarchiv in Germany has a relatively new building in Koblenz, but they'll be moving to Berlin at some point.

00:32.161 --> 00:36.327
There was a piece in the New York Times recently about the particular problems in Germany, of course.

00:37.128 --> 00:42.376
I guess it's hardware, it's software, it's... East German stuff.

00:42.396 --> 00:48.365
The East German stuff that is now totally inaccessible are... Well, they're doing what they call data archaeology.

00:48.826 --> 00:49.146
Data.

00:49.247 --> 00:50.408
Isn't that a wonderful phrase?

00:50.488 --> 00:51.530
I love that.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.473
I think we avoid as much of that.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.015
Do you do data archaeology?

00:55.436 --> 01:01.645
Well, we are basically set up so that we don't have to do it.

01:02.671 --> 01:25.023
We came very close to the kind of stuff that Marilyn Bitzenthaler does for the paper with the White House backup tapes from the Armstrong litigation, tapes containing Oliver North's email.

01:26.826 --> 01:32.053
Some of those tapes were so old and were in such physically bad shape that we had to deal with them as media.

01:32.573 --> 01:38.299
Normally when you're dealing with electronic records, the last thing you want to get into is physical media.

01:38.319 --> 01:43.364
If we got something in from an agency that has a media problem, we send it back and say, give us a good copy.

01:43.905 --> 01:49.611
And then we make our own copies on media that we have a relatively high level of trust in.

01:50.912 --> 01:53.895
And so the thing you do is get rid of the bad media.

01:53.915 --> 01:59.701
You don't try to preserve it, but because this was subject to court orders, we had to preserve the original media.

01:59.721 --> 02:02.344
This is extremely expensive when we start operating at that level.

02:03.016 --> 02:06.682
Just for record, you didn't give me your title, so I can have it.

02:06.702 --> 02:07.263
Okay.

02:07.283 --> 02:10.327
I'm Director of Electronic Records Programs.

02:12.411 --> 02:15.375
Well, that's quite an interesting position.

02:16.016 --> 02:16.196
Yeah.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.642
We're still figuring out what it means.

02:19.662 --> 02:24.169
So your division has been in the news a little bit lately.

02:24.189 --> 02:25.491
Mm-hmm.

02:25.511 --> 02:31.420
Tell me, would you give me an idea of, do we have an idea of what the percentage is of

02:32.277 --> 02:41.208
archival material that's coming into the National Archives that's electronic and not... It's paper.

02:41.428 --> 02:48.257
It's kind of apples and oranges because paper and I think all other records that come here are measured in cubic feet.

02:49.078 --> 02:58.630
With electronic records, that simply is not a relevant measure since the first thing we do with everything is change the cubic footage since we're creating copies, usually on a different media.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.373
And even if they haven't used the same media we do,

03:01.977 --> 03:13.131
Since we have certain standards about how it's technically recorded, it may wind up occupying a different number of volumes on our copy than it did on the A to Z copy.

03:13.151 --> 03:23.204
That said, I would say it's still a relatively very small percentage of what's coming in that's coming in an electron.

03:23.825 --> 03:29.672
The hard copy records that we get are very often thirty years old.

03:30.918 --> 03:36.526
still a big pipeline of paper records that will be coming here for decades and decades.

03:36.666 --> 03:45.158
In fact, we did, the agency did an analysis of our record center programs where we store records temporarily for agency.

03:46.420 --> 03:58.076
And we figured if the record centers went out of business in the year 2000, 50 years later they still would have the majority of all the records that are in there today because they have this long retention period.

03:58.096 --> 04:00.199
Some of those eventually would come into the National Archives.

04:01.090 --> 04:09.639
What I would say is true, in spite of that very small percentage, is we're the fastest growing operation.

04:09.759 --> 04:29.238
We're also the... I mean, we've gone from... When I came here ten years ago, 1988 at the very end, in the prior fiscal year, the agency had received 159 files of digital material.

04:29.259 --> 04:30.760
In 1988?

04:30.976 --> 04:37.143
We basically doubled that every two years until, a couple years ago, we got up to 10,000 files in one year.

04:37.163 --> 04:40.807
Almost 10,000, something like that.

04:40.827 --> 04:40.947
8,700.

04:40.967 --> 04:51.639
But what we're looking at right now is the need to bring in, in the next few years, something between 6 million and 30 million files.

04:51.699 --> 04:53.861
And frankly, we can't do it in a way in the world.

04:55.202 --> 04:58.646
How are electronic files delivered to you?

04:58.666 --> 04:59.447
On physical media.

04:59.849 --> 05:09.903
And we have some very preliminary efforts going on to start tests transferring the stuff over the Internet.

05:10.043 --> 05:20.177
We haven't pushed that in the past because most of the files that come in here are so big that they're not well suited to Internet transfer.

05:20.257 --> 05:22.380
In fact, we asked an agency a few years ago.

05:22.563 --> 05:31.018
to send us some sample records over the internet so we could see what it was they were talking about, because they were unable to tell us technically what the stuff looked like.

05:31.038 --> 05:45.043
Well, they attached a file to an email message, and they wound up not only crashing our connection, the whole agency's connection to the internet, but the server that connection was on was also serving the Office of the Archivist of the United States, the head of the agency.

05:45.648 --> 05:49.372
But his whole office was without computer access for two days.

05:49.793 --> 05:50.053
Two days.

05:50.634 --> 05:52.296
Do you remember the agency just that they did?

05:52.776 --> 05:54.458
Yes, actually.

05:54.478 --> 05:55.500
So you've got a tape play.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.501
I won't give you the details.

05:56.901 --> 05:57.983
That's a great story.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.985
Armed Forces Pathology Institute.

06:00.005 --> 06:00.726
Pathology?

06:00.826 --> 06:01.126
Yes.

06:02.848 --> 06:04.030
And what were they sending for you?

06:04.070 --> 06:14.322
They have a database that basically captures data on every type of wound or injury to the human body that they've ever seen.

06:15.078 --> 06:21.144
so that they can develop medical knowledge on that and treat different types of things.

06:21.164 --> 06:26.249
What happened, actually, was instead of sending us a few sample records, they sent the whole database.

06:26.269 --> 06:27.190
It was 200 megabytes.

06:27.410 --> 06:28.131
Did you receive it?

06:28.151 --> 06:30.113
Did it all— Oh, we received it for two days straight.

06:30.133 --> 06:37.520
I mean, the problem is our server would get it, and then after a while it would say, I can't deal with a 200 megabyte attachment, and it would stop the message.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.903
It actually would crash.

06:39.923 --> 06:44.207
And the Pathology Institute would receive an automatic message from the Institute saying,

06:44.440 --> 06:45.341
transfer incomplete.

06:45.682 --> 06:47.223
So it would resend it every three minutes.

06:47.243 --> 06:48.905
Starting from scratch?

06:48.925 --> 06:50.547
From scratch.

06:50.567 --> 06:53.351
And it took two days to get their system.

06:53.411 --> 06:57.236
Well, it took us probably a day to figure out why our system kept crashing.

06:57.256 --> 07:03.363
Because when it crashes every three minutes, you don't have much of an opportunity to figure out what's going wrong.

07:03.383 --> 07:06.066
After one day, we figured out exactly what was going wrong.

07:06.086 --> 07:07.628
And contact with people.

07:07.648 --> 07:10.572
So nobody was really alert to the fact that this stuff was?

07:11.032 --> 07:13.215
No, because one of the nice things about the internet is the guaranteed

07:13.988 --> 07:15.370
end-to-end transmission.

07:15.390 --> 07:20.717
You submit something there, and you don't need to worry about what problems the network has in getting it to the recipient.

07:20.737 --> 07:23.961
It'll keep sending it until it gets there.

07:23.981 --> 07:24.642
That's a nice story.

07:25.082 --> 07:25.623
Yeah.

07:25.643 --> 07:36.197
When you talk about an individual file, 159 to 10,000... Give me a call when you have some time, and I'll... It'll be really in the next couple of months.

07:36.217 --> 07:37.619
Okay, that's fine.

07:37.639 --> 07:38.079
Ken, thanks very much.

07:38.099 --> 07:38.460
You're welcome.

07:39.982 --> 07:40.823
I'm sorry, go ahead.

07:41.461 --> 07:47.851
When we talk about one file, we're not talking about one file that could be anything.

07:48.552 --> 07:56.124
In the six-month period, we did a review of the files that came in that varied from 30K to 2 gigabytes.

07:58.027 --> 08:08.042
And the extremes will probably get worse, because of the millions of files I'm talking about, at least 24 million are e-mail rates.

08:08.562 --> 08:09.843
These are going to be a couple K.

08:09.863 --> 08:10.844
24 million?

08:11.004 --> 08:11.245
Yeah.

08:11.385 --> 08:12.906
Just from the White House.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.509
Clinton White House.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.632
And these all have to be preserved, right?

08:18.652 --> 08:20.974
Well, there's a question about that.

08:20.994 --> 08:23.256
This is what the litigation is all about, right?

08:23.276 --> 08:35.248
Well, actually, in this particular case of the Clinton White House, they don't have technology available that makes it easy for them to segregate out stuff that we really want to preserve.

08:35.508 --> 08:38.451
So they're saving everything.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.073
But this isn't terribly efficient at all, is it?

08:41.093 --> 08:41.253
No.

08:41.293 --> 08:42.515
This is what we're talking about.

08:42.535 --> 08:58.176
Well, in terms of current operations, it's much easier for them to save everything than to try to figure out what's... Well, with the EOP, we would probably assume a substantial portion would be worth saving.

08:58.196 --> 09:02.522
But you look at any email, and a lot of it by any reasonable standards, it's just trivial.

09:03.103 --> 09:07.909
I do tons of email, and I save maybe 10% on disk.

09:08.130 --> 09:08.370
Yeah.

09:08.890 --> 09:10.612
and the other stuff is chaff.

09:11.452 --> 09:12.413
Who wants it?

09:12.433 --> 09:13.775
Who's ever going to use it?

09:13.855 --> 09:16.077
So you don't have any filtering device in there.

09:16.517 --> 09:23.304
And the problem is basically there aren't off-the-shelf products you can buy that will do that for you.

09:23.324 --> 09:28.049
This is almost like getting a recording of every telephone call.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.070
And who wants that either?

09:29.250 --> 09:32.533
Calling home to see if I should pick something up at the store.

09:33.154 --> 09:36.136
What relevance does that have in the National Archives?

09:37.117 --> 09:38.779
But these are issues that you're basically

09:38.945 --> 09:40.427
being forced to deal with, I guess.

09:40.447 --> 09:40.968
Yeah.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.550
I mean, my hope is someday.

09:42.570 --> 09:47.858
One of the problems we've seen... Now, what's going on over there on our live systems?

09:47.878 --> 09:55.570
They can do this, because an email comes in, and unless the person who gets it or sends it explicitly says, this is not a record.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.753
I'm inviting my friend to go to lunch.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.477
Clearly not a good record.

10:00.497 --> 10:04.724
Unless they say that, a copy is automatically taped.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.845
Automatically.

10:05.966 --> 10:06.787
Yeah.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.568
Automatically taped.

10:08.476 --> 10:11.420
They had to develop their own software to make that happen.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.022
That was as a result of communication.

10:14.924 --> 10:18.208
But there's no filter.

10:18.228 --> 10:22.053
The problem for us is when we started looking into, what are we going to do?

10:22.073 --> 10:27.319
And at a time when we thought it was only six million files, which was true.

10:28.281 --> 10:35.269
It turns out state-of-the-art information technology cannot handle collections as big as two million files.

10:36.431 --> 10:37.572
So we're actually

10:37.771 --> 10:46.425
just in the process of finalizing a contract with the San Diego Supercomputer Center to say, help us to figure out how to deal with this.

10:46.445 --> 10:50.851
They fortunately had a contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

10:50.871 --> 10:53.375
Is that a government facility?

10:53.395 --> 10:58.944
No, I think it's actually part of the California University system.

10:58.964 --> 11:05.955
But they have a lot of contracts from the federal government, from the state of California and local governments out there.

11:06.863 --> 11:10.948
to my knowledge, one of the two biggest supercomputer centers in the world.

11:10.968 --> 11:15.213
If you know what, I am interested in, as I said, I've been to Cornell.

11:15.313 --> 11:18.957
I'm interested in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Viking data.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.341
Do you get involved in that at all, with that Viking data?

11:23.863 --> 11:25.024
On the periphery.

11:25.044 --> 11:30.390
In fact, there may have been a message recently that somebody from JPL had data they wanted to send us.

11:30.927 --> 11:34.270
And they claim to have been negotiating with me on this for two years.

11:35.171 --> 11:36.333
Well, thanks a lot.

11:36.353 --> 11:41.698
This may be a scientist I met two years ago, but it certainly hasn't been going on.

11:44.621 --> 11:49.106
Well, NARA hasn't officially taken a position.

11:49.166 --> 11:58.656
We asked the National Research Council a couple years ago, around 95, to give us some advice

11:58.855 --> 12:10.549
on what should be done about long-term preservation of data from big science, like NASA, the Department of Energy, NOAA, and so on.

12:10.569 --> 12:19.300
And the answer they came back with was basically any decent data should be preserved.

12:19.320 --> 12:24.766
But it should be preserved by the science agencies in subject-oriented data centers.

12:24.787 --> 12:28.491
NASA has over here at Goddard Space Science Data Center.

12:28.758 --> 12:35.868
The Geological Survey operates the AEROS data center, Earth Resources Observation System out in South Dakota.

12:36.770 --> 12:50.790
NOAA has the National Climatic Data Center down in North Carolina, and the National Geophysical and Solar-Terrestrial Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and the Oceanographic Data Center here in Washington.

12:50.810 --> 12:52.953
So these are kind of good models.

12:52.973 --> 12:58.461
Obviously, this recommendation doesn't give us heartaches, because we haven't taken an official position on it.

12:58.778 --> 13:09.172
Professionally, I have a level of comfort knowing that these are organizations which exist to preserve and provide access to this kind of information.

13:10.614 --> 13:18.925
There's so much out there that has no home once the agency's done with it that I'm not going to worry if the science agencies are taking care of their stuff.

13:18.945 --> 13:23.091
Unfortunately, the track record isn't obvious.

13:23.111 --> 13:27.857
JPL has a multi-million dollar initiative that I think was called Pathfinder.

13:28.563 --> 13:57.220
go back and recover data that they had been keeping but which had gotten into a state that they couldn't read it anymore things like the tapes deteriorated or they had never made sure they had the technical documentation they recovered a lot of that and are actually publishing it on cd rome but is this a questionary tale for you here at the national archives sure it is anywhere we look there are questions in the cases of records in jeopardy

13:57.588 --> 14:05.480
are so common that it would be hard for us to say, where's the case where they're really taking care of us?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.944
Well, it really is an interesting situation.

14:07.964 --> 14:16.617
We have this paradigm shift that everyone talks about, and there are genuine, legitimate concerns about the preservation of digital material.

14:17.258 --> 14:18.980
Oh, yeah.

14:19.721 --> 14:21.744
And there's a spectrum.

14:21.764 --> 14:26.211
I don't know if you're aware of the... There was a conference, and there's now a...

14:26.748 --> 14:31.773
an electronic discussion group sponsored by the Getty Foundation called Time and Bits.

14:32.194 --> 14:33.355
Is that the one they get to that?

14:33.375 --> 14:34.376
Yeah.

14:34.396 --> 14:35.297
Getty?

14:35.317 --> 14:35.417
Yeah.

14:35.977 --> 14:38.120
Time and Bits, like B-I-T-S?

14:38.160 --> 14:42.084
Yeah, but and is just N. Time and Bits.

14:44.166 --> 14:44.266
Yeah.

14:44.286 --> 14:55.978
They have a lot of, actually they have people from all over participating in this, including Stuart Brand from the Whole Earth Catalog, Brewster Kahle,

14:57.072 --> 14:58.353
gets involved every now and then.

14:58.413 --> 15:09.004
He runs an operation out in San Francisco called The Internet Archives, where he just scans the World Wide Web and copies everything except where the owners have a certain copyright.

15:10.586 --> 15:11.527
And what does he do with it?

15:11.547 --> 15:12.388
He keeps it.

15:13.169 --> 15:14.390
And he has an archive?

15:15.011 --> 15:15.431
Yeah.

15:15.491 --> 15:17.353
And what medium is he saving on?

15:17.373 --> 15:23.059
He's saving on digital longitudinal tape.

15:23.079 --> 15:24.801
Is that pretty reliable stuff?

15:25.945 --> 15:37.922
There's a good chance that when we, periodically, we look at our preservation media, because there's no, well, we look at what media we're using for preservation, because there is no archival media in the digital world.

15:37.942 --> 15:47.135
And I would expect if we looked at it within the next year or two, we'd probably decide to go to that.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.278
You said there is no preservation media in the digital world.

15:49.298 --> 15:51.080
Well, if there was something that was permanent.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.944
In fact, we had the National Institutes of Standards

15:55.105 --> 16:04.719
standards in technology, probably 10, 11 years ago now, do a study for us on digital media, specifically on optical disks.

16:04.739 --> 16:11.689
And they came back and said, manufacturers' claims that this stuff will last 100 years are probably understated.

16:11.709 --> 16:12.931
Their bottom line was, so what?

16:13.592 --> 16:17.258
In five years, you're going to have trouble finding drives to read this stuff.

16:17.278 --> 16:18.379
And we've seen that happen.

16:18.620 --> 16:22.345
I know several major institutions that have decided to go there.

16:22.662 --> 16:26.726
optical disks and have found their systems obsolete before they were fully implemented.

16:26.746 --> 16:29.729
What institution is just out of curiosity?

16:29.869 --> 16:48.206
Well, what used to be the largest, well, it still is, the largest social science data archive in the world is the ICPSR, which is the Inter-University Consortium for Social and Political Research, housed at the University of Michigan.

16:48.887 --> 16:52.450
Some years ago, maybe six, seven, they decided to go to

16:53.206 --> 16:54.788
optical disk.

16:54.808 --> 17:00.596
And if I remember correctly in their case, the company actually went out of existence before the system was delivered.

17:00.616 --> 17:07.885
Another company picked it up, but they were in London and they weren't willing to give them any support in Michigan.

17:07.945 --> 17:14.614
The Space Telescope Institute up here at Johns Hopkins, I think, had a similar experience.

17:14.634 --> 17:20.622
Our colleagues at the National Archives of Canada had a similar experience.

17:20.642 --> 17:21.643
And basically any

17:22.366 --> 17:28.514
collecting institute that I've talked to that made the switch to optical disks that wound up to this kind of problem.

17:28.675 --> 17:30.417
So do they have material that they can't access?

17:30.857 --> 17:32.179
Well, no.

17:32.219 --> 17:37.146
Fortunately, most of them still had stuff on tape, because you always keep people copying them.

17:37.166 --> 17:44.977
In fact, the Canadians hedged their beds, and they made one copy on tape and one on optical.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.318
Tape is a horrendous medium.

17:46.338 --> 17:46.999
It doesn't last.

17:47.019 --> 17:48.181
It self-destructs.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.302
It's extremely fragile.

17:49.322 --> 17:51.225
It's sensitive to molds.

17:51.593 --> 17:56.538
humidity, changes in temperature, but I kind of regard it as the devil I know.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.082
That stuff will be lucky the last two years.

18:04.166 --> 18:14.097
And the problem is, because of the market drive to miniaturization, the tape gets less and less stable.

18:14.117 --> 18:20.183
That tape is not inherently stiff enough to pass flat over a tape head, which means you can't really use it to

18:20.821 --> 18:22.723
So to make it, they stretch it.

18:23.004 --> 18:24.425
It's a little stiff.

18:24.445 --> 18:26.748
But the molecules remember their natural configuration.

18:26.788 --> 18:30.673
Over a period of three years or so, they're going to go back.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.515
These basically are one shot for me.

18:33.316 --> 18:33.997
I use them once.

18:34.077 --> 18:34.938
I transcribe them.

18:35.018 --> 18:36.159
I save them.

18:36.179 --> 18:38.682
I have all my tapes from my first book, 250 of them.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.504
I haven't gone back to see them.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.006
It would be amazing if you'd cut it.

18:42.026 --> 18:45.030
Thankfully, I do have the transcripts.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.773
You have a little more tolerance on analog.

18:48.918 --> 18:51.982
Because, you know, they use this for digital, too.

18:52.302 --> 18:55.506
But if you lose a little bit of tape, you've lost thousands of bits.

18:55.726 --> 18:59.771
Whereas on the stuff we use, you lose a little bit of tape and hardly lost anything.

19:00.031 --> 19:04.296
So, um, have you read Jeff Rothenberg?

19:04.436 --> 19:07.700
I understand there's a revised copy of that.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.423
There was a piece in the New York Times that there's a revised?

19:10.443 --> 19:10.723
Yeah.

19:10.783 --> 19:15.769
There was a piece in the New York Times last week, and it was, uh,

19:16.694 --> 19:25.864
I'll be happy to e-mail the New York Times story to you if you want, but it did mention that Jeff Rothenberg has a revised copy of that.

19:25.884 --> 19:27.646
Is this the one that James Glick wrote?

19:28.166 --> 19:29.968
No, Jeff Rothenberg was a scientist.

19:30.028 --> 19:31.830
No, but I mean the article in the Times.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.792
I'm not sure.

19:33.812 --> 19:38.097
Glick had one in the Sunday Magazine.

19:38.117 --> 19:39.038
Two weeks ago.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.380
Glick is terrific.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.702
He wrote that book on it.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.015
Yeah.

19:44.876 --> 19:49.643
In fact, when I was talking to him for the article, I didn't know how he pronounced his name, and I didn't realize who he was.

19:49.983 --> 19:52.747
In fact, I didn't even have this chaos software.

19:53.889 --> 20:02.721
But yeah, and it was a good article because he has a bit of perspective that we usually hear from people who act like, if you don't save everything that's on computers.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.846
In fact, he starts with a quote from Stuart Brand.

20:05.866 --> 20:07.268
Is it in the New York Times Magazine?

20:07.308 --> 20:07.688
Yeah.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.153
Easter Sunday.

20:11.690 --> 20:18.040
He starts quoting Brandt, who said something like, more information has been lost in the digital era than all of history.

20:19.142 --> 20:25.232
And my immediate reaction to that was, well, more information has been recorded in the last ten years than all of history.

20:25.352 --> 20:25.873
So what?

20:26.554 --> 20:28.577
So what is your attitude on this?

20:28.597 --> 20:31.482
I mean, tell me about this, about the gloom and doom?

20:32.003 --> 20:37.191
Well, there are different values.

20:39.685 --> 20:49.137
In fact, they have different values in our community.

20:49.317 --> 21:04.256
I actually started out my career wanting to specialize in not so much the fall of the Roman Empire, but what happened to the tribes that came out of the German forests that wound up governing former Roman provinces.

21:04.276 --> 21:05.457
I just discovered there wasn't

21:05.774 --> 21:08.859
much of a market.

21:11.223 --> 21:26.747
But having tried to specialize in that field, I know that historians can, and other disciplines like anthropology and archaeology, can glean incredible insights out of scanty information.

21:26.767 --> 21:31.495
I'm probably a little bit more sanguine than a lot of historians who are afraid to lose

21:31.998 --> 21:35.182
one draft in the sequence of 10 drafts of a document.

21:35.202 --> 21:37.845
And I understand how that document came about.

21:38.666 --> 22:00.874
But we're getting a lot of criticism from the historical profession, but specifically the people who do diplomatic history and political history, which is a small specialization within the history of the historical field, that we're not emphasizing keeping all the drafts of all the documents that are produced in the government

22:01.445 --> 22:02.266
at high levels.

22:03.427 --> 22:10.014
In their view, by the time it gets to be an official government record, it's lost all its interest.

22:10.034 --> 22:12.257
I call that, summarize it, saying they're digging for dirt.

22:13.238 --> 22:18.684
Whereas we start from a, well, NARA has a dual role.

22:18.764 --> 22:24.010
We have oversight responsibility for the whole government on how they create and manage records.

22:24.891 --> 22:30.777
And then we have this National Archives, the Presidential Libraries, where we preserve what we think is the historical value.

22:31.313 --> 22:41.782
But we start with a premise that the government will be better if the government has better records, if they're reliable, accurate, complete, retirement, and so on.

22:41.802 --> 22:43.844
The service you do to the nation is going to be better.

22:44.264 --> 22:51.010
And that for historical purposes, it would be a lot better for us to be able to say, you know, what we've got here is definitive.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.932
It's the stuff on which the government based its decisions and so on.

22:53.952 --> 22:57.555
So we have this emphasis on quality records management.

22:57.575 --> 23:00.898
And in quality records management, the kind of stuff that historians are looking for at the margins,

23:02.178 --> 23:10.896
shouldn't be there, because government servants should know enough that they do jobs, their jobs according to very high standards.

23:10.916 --> 23:14.745
And you're not finding the kind of stuff you may find.

23:14.765 --> 23:23.022
There have been above notes passed on government email systems for several administrations.

23:23.727 --> 23:28.693
I'm sure there's lots of people in journalism and other fields who love to see that stuff.

23:29.074 --> 23:33.559
But there is selection going on about what to keep and what not to keep.

23:33.639 --> 23:36.062
So who's making the qualitative decisions?

23:36.122 --> 23:37.904
Basically, that's our authority.

23:38.365 --> 23:48.357
And we're actually about to start a business process re-engineering act to re-look at how we do this in total.

23:48.377 --> 23:51.281
But typically, I mean, there's some things that are fairly obvious.

23:51.301 --> 23:53.143
That if it's agency policy,

23:53.478 --> 24:00.627
If it was issued as a directive, if it tells you how the agency was organized, we're going to keep all that on top of any question.

24:00.887 --> 24:09.938
You can almost assume that any cabinet-level official, any agency head, we're going to want their correspondence files.

24:10.219 --> 24:16.527
Then you start looking at what's the agency's business and what are the records that best document that business.

24:16.547 --> 24:23.215
And there's a lot, I mean, archival theory about what are the best records to save is kind of all over the place.

24:23.785 --> 24:31.192
In general, archivists around the world in the last 10 years have focused on what we call evidential values.

24:31.712 --> 24:38.899
That is, the stuff that will tell you how the government worked, what the decisions were, what the follow-up decisions.

24:38.919 --> 24:45.445
Our law, the Federal Records Act, also says we have to consider the value of the information contained in the records.

24:46.867 --> 24:50.350
And if we get something in excess of

24:51.325 --> 24:58.452
The number is 300,000 visitors or visits to the National Archives in Washington every year.

24:58.752 --> 25:03.797
There are comparable numbers in our field of operations.

25:03.817 --> 25:08.601
Of the 300,000-plus, at least 300,000 are people doing family history.

25:08.621 --> 25:15.208
They're interested in the information of the records, not what it tells you about what the government was doing.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.670
The record of their grandparents' immigration or

25:18.747 --> 25:23.593
parents' service and all of them, too, that kind of stuff.

25:23.613 --> 25:26.276
They're not interested in policy files and so on.

25:26.296 --> 25:34.266
So I think our law is reasonable in that the American people are telling us this stuff is valuable to them.

25:34.286 --> 25:41.415
We're providing a service by making sure this stuff gets kept and it's available to them, even though most archivists would tell us that that's not the stuff you should do.

25:41.435 --> 25:47.202
Do you have any sense of how much of what you're saving is ever going to be used, is ever going to be accessed?

25:47.924 --> 25:52.511
There's a huge range.

25:52.531 --> 26:01.925
You could say, on average, most of the paper records in this building are stored in what are called archives boxes.

26:02.045 --> 26:03.948
One of those boxes is a third of a cubic foot.

26:04.288 --> 26:10.878
You can assume that the average box in the National Archives is not pulled off the shelf once in ten years.

26:10.898 --> 26:13.442
On the other hand, downtown

26:13.878 --> 26:21.909
The main archives building, we have a room with 98 microphone readers for the stuff that's in such high use that we microfilmed it.

26:21.929 --> 26:26.054
There are copies around the country, and there are even copies sold by private companies.

26:26.575 --> 26:33.044
But there are a lot of days, and you wait in line to get at one of those 98 microphone readers, and we have to sit.

26:33.064 --> 26:37.069
You know, you can have it for two hours, but then you're going to have to get off, because other people are waiting.

26:37.910 --> 26:40.594
Of the stuff we have in electronic form,

26:41.452 --> 26:44.095
There's some stuff that I'd be surprised if it ever gets used.

26:44.115 --> 26:48.440
There's some stuff that I'd be surprised if more than a week went by that didn't get used.

26:49.241 --> 26:53.686
The most highly active stuff is military casualty information for a variety of reasons.

26:53.706 --> 26:56.370
It's in constant demand.

26:56.390 --> 26:59.653
Now, do you make high copies of any of this electronic stuff?

26:59.693 --> 27:04.719
For the casualty stuff we do, because it's changed over time.

27:04.799 --> 27:10.446
When I first came ten years ago, there were a lot of communities around the country who were building memorials to their

27:10.628 --> 27:15.134
and the war did from Vietnam, so they were warning the lists from them.

27:15.154 --> 27:18.760
More recently, the demand is people doing family history.

27:18.780 --> 27:24.888
Occasionally, it's people looking for their buddies that they served with in Vietnam, or what happened to their buddies.

27:27.713 --> 27:33.841
So for that kind of clientele, because the demand is high enough, we actually print the stuff out in advance.

27:34.342 --> 27:39.049
Although, most recently, we've just started sticking it on the website and saying, you want these printed lists?

27:39.069 --> 27:39.910
Just download it.

27:40.210 --> 27:47.177
If you write to us or call us, we're going to have to charge you a minimum fee for mailing it to you if you want to download it.

27:47.357 --> 27:48.358
Sure, it is for free.

27:48.378 --> 27:49.319
So are people using that?

27:51.381 --> 27:51.501
Yeah.

27:51.521 --> 27:53.963
In fact, even when they call us, that's my first recommendation.

27:54.283 --> 27:55.284
Why should you pay us $5?

27:55.304 --> 27:57.366
We can get it for free.

27:57.386 --> 28:00.809
And that saves you, uh, yeah, it saves us work.

28:00.869 --> 28:04.633
It allows us to deal with those things where we really need to do some hand-holding.

28:04.713 --> 28:09.998
I read in a couple of papers that you have policies on refreshing of your

28:10.315 --> 28:12.297
Could you tell me a little bit about that?

28:12.337 --> 28:14.760
Well, basically, as I said, there's no archival medium.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.403
If there was, we wouldn't use it.

28:19.185 --> 28:24.450
It wouldn't matter if there was one, because as long as the technology continues to change, you've got this problem.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.693
If the medium lasts, the equipment becomes obsolete.

28:26.713 --> 28:30.437
You can't buy it, and you can't afford to maintain it after a while.

28:30.457 --> 28:39.006
Since we started taking stuff in, which was 1971 or 72, in digital form, we've been using one form of mag taper or another.

28:39.593 --> 28:45.922
And since then, we've had a policy that when any tape gets to be 10 years old, we're going to copy it to something new.

28:45.942 --> 28:47.444
And that's been fairly good.

28:49.907 --> 28:53.172
Some organizations use a five-year refreshment cycle.

28:53.572 --> 28:54.814
We've been using a 10-year.

28:55.715 --> 28:58.719
And as long as nothing goes wrong, that's adequate.

28:58.819 --> 29:01.483
We also do an annual sample to make sure nothing's going wrong.

29:02.172 --> 29:10.424
In fact, we discovered some tapes that were bought in the late 80s started going bad within three years, so we had a huge effort to get everything off of those tapes.

29:10.484 --> 29:12.587
Have you lost stuff?

29:14.690 --> 29:18.075
Probably over time we lost some stuff.

29:18.095 --> 29:18.696
Not a lot.

29:19.217 --> 29:22.241
We have a—and we get better at what we can recover.

29:23.863 --> 29:30.593
We have a routine now where—since we have two copies of everything, it used to be the old copy was

29:31.467 --> 29:33.068
literally the backup copy.

29:33.089 --> 29:35.291
If your master goes bad, try the backup.

29:36.011 --> 29:47.142
Because, with an irony that, I think it was around 87, 88, the predecessor unit had a little bit of money, which was extremely scarce.

29:47.162 --> 29:50.765
They bought 5,000 tapes and said, at least we have this to use for preservation purposes.

29:51.446 --> 29:52.787
Turns out it was a bad batch.

29:54.208 --> 29:57.131
And this stuff was inherently unstable.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.394
So we're getting both masters and backups going bad.

30:00.728 --> 30:06.397
So we've adjusted our system that we can actually go in and take pieces out of the two of them and recombine them.

30:06.757 --> 30:08.480
Very labor-intensive, unfortunately.

30:08.500 --> 30:13.027
But we can do that, which is not the way computers normally process the whole file.

30:14.670 --> 30:28.491
So because of that, and because we've developed things like we have a tape drive across the hall where we've taken the shell off, and we'll have one of the technical people standing there with a cotton swab with alcohol, wiping the tape as it goes through,

30:28.741 --> 30:44.276
Because otherwise, what's happening is the tape is disintegrating chemically, and the chemicals, when it heats up and it's moving on the drive, the chemicals come to the surface, they reach a flash point, they melt, and then they solidify, jamming themselves to all the parts of the tape drive.

30:44.837 --> 30:50.022
So by standing there with the alcohol, we can get through one, and that's all we need, because one should make a cup.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.403
Yeah.

30:51.423 --> 30:52.505
You know, we see that in paper.

30:53.746 --> 30:56.048
Roger Studd at Harvard was telling me that he has some

30:56.686 --> 31:14.462
and he's the curator of Rare Books in the Fulton Library, he bought some old mimeographed records of the Black Panther Party up in there, and he said, these things were mimeographed in the West paper, and he said, these papers have, at best, one look.

31:15.523 --> 31:21.468
So if I'm a scholar coming in and I want to look at it, he's not going to let me look at it, or we'll make a deal.

31:21.528 --> 31:26.052
You get a grant, and maybe I can copy them, you know, and I'll let you look at them.

31:26.453 --> 31:30.318
But he said, these papers, he believes there is just one read left.

31:30.379 --> 31:33.102
That's kind of what you're saying with the tapes, isn't it?

31:33.122 --> 31:36.748
If the medium starts going bad, the first thing we do is just copy it.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.014
Because once you've got the copy, you can do whatever you want.

31:41.474 --> 31:43.137
And that's the essence of migration, isn't it?

31:43.157 --> 31:45.780
That phrase, actually, what we're doing is copy.

31:45.961 --> 31:54.353
Well, because basically everything we have here, with a few exceptions, is in a format that's not dependent on any specific technology.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.055
So all we have to do is copy it over.

31:56.542 --> 32:12.044
The newer stuff that's been created, basically since the rise of PCs, which is software-dependent, the Jeff Rothenberg problem, were in a bind because you cannot translate it into a neutral format without losing something.

32:12.886 --> 32:17.793
You could translate any word processing document into plain ASCII, but you lose the fonts, you lose the pages.

32:17.973 --> 32:19.815
Well, you might not necessarily lose the page layout.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.017
You probably lose footnotes.

32:21.638 --> 32:25.063
So you lose a lot of important stuff about the contents.

32:26.495 --> 32:36.135
But then, I don't care what word processing software you're using today, I feel fairly certain in 30 years no one's going to know what the word word processing means.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.819
Or if they do, it's sort of like punch cards.

32:38.781 --> 32:42.649
In a few years we'll be talking to our computers.

32:42.689 --> 32:46.697
Well, I've got a thing now, which is maybe they say it's 90% effective.

32:47.335 --> 32:50.899
10% that isn't makes it maddening.

32:51.279 --> 32:56.585
You see the stupid words that come up, and they don't go through a spelling check because they're real words.

32:57.345 --> 33:05.314
So I try to transcribe these tapes by talking into them, but I can see where the technology is just going to get there.

33:05.574 --> 33:06.795
Yeah, it will get there.

33:07.036 --> 33:13.923
And you think the word processing as we know it is going to be, typing skills are going to vanish?

33:14.683 --> 33:17.106
Well, it's interesting.

33:17.710 --> 33:22.296
There was a point where I used to say, I love word processing.

33:22.737 --> 33:26.062
It's really great for editing, but I can't think of one of these machines.

33:26.102 --> 33:28.485
I have to think with a pen in my hand.

33:28.505 --> 33:31.469
Then one day I noticed it's been a long time since I used a pen.

33:31.489 --> 33:34.513
Yeah, no, my best writing is on one of these things.

33:34.534 --> 33:40.241
And then the revision that it allows you to do is, you couldn't live without it.

33:40.382 --> 33:41.503
Yeah.

33:41.603 --> 33:46.350
Let's talk briefly, and then I don't get up to time, but you said that

33:46.735 --> 33:49.238
You studied in the great books program in order to be taught in it.

33:49.258 --> 33:50.059
I got taught in it.

33:50.079 --> 33:50.819
You got taught it?

33:50.839 --> 33:51.100
Yeah.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.741
Am I telling me a little bit about that?

33:52.761 --> 33:56.205
It was, I would say, inspired by St.

33:56.225 --> 33:57.607
John's.

33:57.627 --> 33:58.528
I don't remember exactly when it was.

33:58.548 --> 33:59.208
And when was this?

33:59.929 --> 34:03.473
When I taught there, it was the early 70s, from early 70 to 74.

34:03.953 --> 34:04.754
In what department?

34:05.235 --> 34:07.357
It was called the General Program of Liberal Studies.

34:07.677 --> 34:12.102
It was a three-year major in which each semester the students had a

34:12.925 --> 34:14.607
four-hour seminar in the great books.

34:14.907 --> 34:15.928
And it differed from St.

34:15.948 --> 34:32.987
John's in that we had what we called tutorials, which are more typical lecture classes in, actually in subjects related to the great books, like they took philosophy, they took literature, they took, well, I was there because one of the tutorials was in history of science.

34:33.007 --> 34:35.509
They had three semesters of history of science.

34:35.529 --> 34:38.353
They had some classes in art.

34:38.373 --> 34:42.477
So the idea, I think, was helps them understand the great books better by getting some context.

34:42.794 --> 34:45.237
We had one of the great lights of St.

34:45.257 --> 34:49.882
John come up, and he thought this was horrible that we were getting lecture classes.

34:49.902 --> 34:50.603
Right?

34:50.623 --> 34:50.723
Yeah.

34:50.743 --> 34:52.665
Well, they don't even say they have teachers over there.

34:52.685 --> 34:56.329
They are tours or whatever.

34:56.350 --> 34:56.450
Yeah.

34:56.470 --> 34:58.172
That's why we call these things tutorials.

34:58.232 --> 34:59.793
I see.

35:00.434 --> 35:03.037
How do you feel about this?

35:03.137 --> 35:08.143
I mean, I don't mean to get off into the question of the literary canon or anything like that.

35:08.613 --> 35:12.918
But I'm quite interested in seeing what this is all about.

35:12.958 --> 35:18.483
I'd like to see what kind of a kid today is interested in going off to study the great books in the late 1990s.

35:18.503 --> 35:20.045
Yeah, it would be interesting.

35:20.706 --> 35:34.300
When I was teaching in the 70s, which is an interesting period, because one of my colleagues who came the same year I did, and it turned out he and I had been in the same undergraduate school together, but he was a chemistry major at Fordham in New York.

35:34.769 --> 35:40.857
So we'd never met as undergraduates, but we wound up teaching in the same department at Notre Dame.

35:40.897 --> 35:47.126
The way he described it is, when we came, there was no question there would be a revolution.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.248
The only question was when it would be.

35:49.369 --> 35:52.693
Three years later, they were all Republicans.

35:52.993 --> 36:01.425
But that department at the time tended to get much better students than the average department at the university.

36:01.465 --> 36:01.705
Very high.

36:03.203 --> 36:09.831
College board scores, very high grade averages, a lot of students on merit-type scholarships and so on.

36:09.851 --> 36:11.934
Some extremely bright kids.

36:12.935 --> 36:15.639
I had some students who I was absolutely sure were a lot smaller than I was.

36:16.700 --> 36:17.721
There was just no question about it.

36:18.983 --> 36:20.525
You know, not everybody was that way.

36:20.625 --> 36:29.937
But it was interesting that in that era, especially with the attitude of the 60s and 70s, that kids were willing to study the great books.

36:30.592 --> 36:33.716
And how did you migrate from the Great Books?

36:33.916 --> 36:37.141
Now you were an archivist?

36:39.464 --> 36:47.174
Well, actually, the Great Books was kind of an anomaly, because I've always had a historical interest, almost like I was born as a historian.

36:47.194 --> 36:58.489
I can remember running home from school the first week of second grade, because in second grade we got to study history, and I now have history texts that I can read, and I ran home and started reading it.

36:58.925 --> 37:03.291
And it just was never any question of what I was going to be when I grew up.

37:04.813 --> 37:07.777
And I became a historian of science because I've always been fascinated by science.

37:08.698 --> 37:11.502
In some ways, I think it's simpler than history.

37:12.644 --> 37:19.313
If it wasn't, we'd have much more robust social sciences and human sciences.

37:20.963 --> 37:30.779
But at the time I was entering grad school, it was NDEA Title IV, which was a program that the federal government had created in response to Sputnik, that we had to improve science education in America.

37:31.139 --> 37:35.547
So the history of science departments around the country were doing great.

37:35.747 --> 37:48.287
And it turned out that in Fordham, we had such a tremendous professor in medieval history that all of the top students in the history department wanted to go to grad school in medieval history, so we were all going to be competing for the same grad schools.

37:48.841 --> 37:52.847
I thought, well, I have enough of a science background that I can get into history of science.

37:52.867 --> 37:53.748
So I went into that.

37:54.469 --> 38:01.699
And while I was in grad school, they cut off Title IV money, and the history of science department started going down.

38:01.759 --> 38:03.582
So it came time for me to look for a job.

38:05.004 --> 38:10.712
Because Notre Dame had this undergraduate program, the only condition was I had to teach great books.

38:10.732 --> 38:15.338
Fortunately, I came out of Fordham, which still, at that time, I don't know what it's doing today.

38:15.773 --> 38:21.880
But the curriculum in Fordham in the 1960s was essentially a 19th century American Protestant college curriculum.

38:22.381 --> 38:23.002
If you look back to it.

38:23.022 --> 38:23.482
Fordham was?

38:23.642 --> 38:24.083
Yeah.

38:24.103 --> 38:25.464
I mean, this was a Jesuit school.

38:25.484 --> 38:25.625
Yeah.

38:26.185 --> 38:34.795
But I had a friend at the University of Pennsylvania who did his dissertation on scientific education in early America.

38:35.676 --> 38:43.806
And he discovered that in all these classic American schools like Harvard and Yale, when they were still closely associated with their religious origins,

38:45.170 --> 38:51.017
You had four years of philosophy, four years of theology, a strong liberal heartstring.

38:51.457 --> 38:55.402
In Fordham, if you enrolled there as a Catholic, you got four years of theology.

38:55.422 --> 38:57.765
No matter what faith you were, you got four years of philosophy.

39:00.668 --> 39:05.093
So I at least had exposure to a lot of the great books.

39:05.113 --> 39:06.975
It wasn't that hard to get into that.

39:06.995 --> 39:11.421
But my own research, a lot of it's been in the quantitative area.

39:11.441 --> 39:13.523
And in the mid-70s,

39:14.347 --> 39:19.674
the National Archives decided to create a new program for digital records.

39:19.694 --> 39:21.977
So they started that in the 70s.

39:22.578 --> 39:24.981
Well, they actually had a committee formed in 68.

39:25.762 --> 39:26.043
Wow.

39:26.383 --> 39:27.985
I have to realize it went back.

39:28.005 --> 39:29.227
Yeah.

39:29.427 --> 39:37.177
The impetus came... I'm getting to the point where I'm forgetting names.

39:37.197 --> 39:41.383
The impetus came from the Social Science Research Council

39:42.106 --> 39:49.052
which created a committee in the mid-'60s to look at the long-term value of digital social science data.

39:50.033 --> 39:54.637
And it was a Yale professor who chaired that committee.

39:54.657 --> 39:57.080
In fact, his name became the Association of the Committee.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.322
For some reason, I'm blocking it right now.

39:59.342 --> 40:05.948
And they really recommended this data, even though it's been seen as a convenience to get processes done.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.410
It's a lot of important data, especially census-type stuff.

40:08.430 --> 40:09.971
It really should be preserved.

40:09.991 --> 40:10.712
So the National Archives

40:11.198 --> 40:13.361
formed an internal work group to look at that.

40:14.042 --> 40:20.010
And over a couple of years, they decided they agreed with the social scientists and recommended a permanent program to be established.

40:20.050 --> 40:26.418
So it was in 72, at a branch level in 75, and it was upgraded to a division.

40:26.439 --> 40:29.062
And they started really expanding.

40:29.082 --> 40:37.854
And through a colleague of mine who taught quantitative history at the University of Illinois in Chicago, I was just offered a job here.

40:38.815 --> 40:40.918
I hadn't even applied for it.

40:41.236 --> 40:42.978
working for the federal government.

40:42.998 --> 40:49.423
But then when I found out what it was about, and when they brought me on, they assigned me to work with all the major science agencies.

40:49.443 --> 40:50.624
So I was extremely happy.

40:50.644 --> 40:51.846
To me, this was living history.

40:51.906 --> 40:56.970
You had to go around and find out what are some of the best scientists in the world.

40:56.990 --> 40:59.372
At that time, there were four Nobel laureates at NIH.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.075
Interview them about what they're doing.

41:02.095 --> 41:05.077
Do they think their data is useful to other scientists?

41:05.118 --> 41:05.898
Then you did that?

41:06.098 --> 41:06.619
Yeah.

41:06.719 --> 41:07.079
Oh, yeah.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.602
I mean, my real interests were more than physical science.

41:09.622 --> 41:11.243
But I actually wound up going to work at NIH.

41:12.286 --> 41:14.569
I swore a four Nobel Laureate semester.

41:14.649 --> 41:22.598
I've been out of NIH now ten years, but the place was an amazing place to work.

41:22.858 --> 41:29.826
In fact, I have a ski buddy who started working at NIH two years after I was born, in 1947.

41:29.846 --> 41:31.428
He started working there.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.070
He's still there emeritus.

41:33.150 --> 41:34.612
He's a scientist.

41:34.632 --> 41:39.778
And when I first met him in the early 80s, he would say, this place is magic.

41:40.332 --> 41:45.059
It was just thrilling to be in that environment, to watch how the scientists were working.

41:45.820 --> 41:52.630
One of the reasons it was magic is because unlike the people who get NIH grants, they're not on a three-year grant cycle.

41:52.650 --> 41:54.073
They're tenured federal employees.

41:54.714 --> 42:01.484
So they could do long-term research projects that if you had to show your university, you were able to get a grant every three years.

42:01.524 --> 42:07.673
You wouldn't attack this guy who's a specialist in the transport of

42:07.788 --> 42:11.272
fatty acids and other stuff like that in the blood system.

42:11.292 --> 42:15.517
His research didn't pay off for about three years.

42:15.537 --> 42:21.565
But it's paid off so much that now he's going all over the world getting international awards for lifetime's work.

42:21.985 --> 42:25.009
So how do you distinguish between an archivist and a librarian?

42:26.511 --> 42:29.634
The basic difference is that we deal with records.

42:29.855 --> 42:36.883
Records, rather than information that's designed to be published, and therefore essentially self-contained, freestanding,

42:37.454 --> 42:43.663
Records are simply instruments and byproducts of doing business.

42:43.703 --> 42:45.566
They're not produced for a general audience.

42:45.586 --> 42:51.534
They're produced for people with whom you're interacting in the course of business.

42:51.554 --> 42:58.904
And basically, to understand a record, you have to understand the context in which it was created.

43:00.086 --> 43:04.913
So our discipline is really developed around things like

43:05.838 --> 43:10.824
How do you help records creators to create authentic, reliable records?

43:11.545 --> 43:16.231
How do you help people coming in 50 years after the fact define stuff in records?

43:16.251 --> 43:19.815
Because records are rarely ever organized by subject.

43:19.836 --> 43:21.858
We don't organize things the way a library does.

43:22.078 --> 43:24.922
Archives organize them by where they came from.

43:24.982 --> 43:28.867
Archives organize them by where they came from.

43:28.887 --> 43:29.868
By their provenance, yeah.

43:31.871 --> 43:33.853
The fundamental principle of archives is called the principle.

43:34.188 --> 43:40.456
So even if you have related materials that would really give context, they aren't going to be together.

43:40.936 --> 43:55.394
If you have something that comes from the State Department, about the Vietnam War, and the Defense Department, and the CIA, that's all going to be... But we could help you find it.

43:56.416 --> 44:00.060
And there have been cases when records after the fact have been reorganized by subjects.

44:00.530 --> 44:01.651
It's kind of offensive.

44:01.691 --> 44:03.653
There must be records from all over the place.

44:03.813 --> 44:04.614
All over the place.

44:04.854 --> 44:12.322
But if you came here and talked to one of our consultants who's familiar with that era, they would ask you about your interests.

44:12.342 --> 44:17.807
And then they would ask themselves, now, what government agencies were in a business that would have involved them in that?

44:17.827 --> 44:21.191
And they would steer you to the records of the relevant agencies.

44:21.211 --> 44:23.713
And they have pretty good databases to help.

44:23.753 --> 44:25.955
No.

44:25.975 --> 44:29.659
Most of the finding aids today are on paper.

44:30.314 --> 44:34.921
Some of them are in microform.

44:34.941 --> 44:39.187
We have a longstanding project.

44:39.207 --> 44:51.004
I think it goes back now probably at least 15 years, if not 20, to create a huge database that will tell people about everything in the National Archives.

44:51.024 --> 44:54.870
But there's an implementation for Still Pictures.

44:55.120 --> 45:00.067
I think they extended that to motion pictures, but most of the records are textual.

45:00.087 --> 45:20.937
Well, every once in a while, I just did a story on the New York Public Library and their Romanov collection, which they acquired not long after the Soviet Union took over, and they were getting rid of all the royal stuff, and the New York Public Library bought a spectacular collection of material.

45:21.578 --> 45:23.541
Well, they had an exhibition a couple of months ago,

45:24.736 --> 45:30.103
And these books in the library were scattered all over the place, because there were books, let's say, on geography.

45:30.344 --> 45:32.066
There were books on Slavic history.

45:32.286 --> 45:38.875
And now this is a thing that almost cried out for Provenants, to keep the collection together.

45:39.436 --> 45:54.557
And it's almost like exactly the opposite of what you talked about, where this is where the librarian really should have sat down and said, maybe we should keep this stuff together instead of supporting the Slavic collection over here.

45:54.824 --> 45:56.507
the military history collection.

45:56.547 --> 46:01.033
It went off to at least a half a dozen different divisions in the New York Public Library, which is massive.

46:01.053 --> 46:01.194
Yeah.

46:01.294 --> 46:04.939
And so you really don't have a sense of this collection as a collection.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.181
Yeah.

46:06.201 --> 46:14.894
And in the case of records, if they're not produced as freestanding items, if you take a record out of its original context, you really can't make it.

46:14.914 --> 46:17.498
Then it will be greatly impoverished.

46:17.918 --> 46:20.983
Besides provenance, one of the basic principles is it's the original order.

46:21.740 --> 46:28.532
don't mess with the way the creator organized their records, because that reflects how they were using the information.

46:28.552 --> 46:29.915
So context is everything.

46:30.115 --> 46:30.596
Oh, yeah.

46:30.616 --> 46:31.337
It's true.

46:31.357 --> 46:34.443
Is it up to the archivist to determine context?

46:35.204 --> 46:39.933
There is an archival activity, which you wouldn't know if I looked at my desk, that's called Perfecting the Arrangement.

46:40.314 --> 46:46.144
And that is, if records come in that are obviously disordered,

46:47.828 --> 46:57.138
We will try to figure out what was the original arrangement the creator used, and to the extent possible, put the records back into that arrangement.

46:57.158 --> 47:08.591
But, yeah, the three-volume guide to what's in the National Archives is all arranged, except for the index at the end, by the agency that created the records.

47:09.512 --> 47:15.439
I might just take a look at this.

47:15.892 --> 47:18.938
Probably the last edition of that book that will ever come out.

47:18.958 --> 47:20.441
It's published by the federal government?

47:20.461 --> 47:23.748
Yeah.

47:23.768 --> 47:25.952
Check this out at the Boston Public Library.

47:25.972 --> 47:27.956
They're there at the Pository Library.

47:28.016 --> 47:28.757
Yeah, they should have it.

47:28.797 --> 47:29.759
It's published by J.P.O.

47:30.361 --> 47:31.423
I believe.

47:31.523 --> 47:35.050
A lot of our stuff, it should be there.

47:35.451 --> 47:37.174
A lot of our stuff gets published by

47:37.846 --> 47:42.932
the National Archives trust funders who doesn't necessarily go through DPL, but I'm pretty sure DPL has everything.

47:44.735 --> 47:47.959
Listen, you've given me very generously.

47:47.979 --> 47:49.060
It is generous.

47:50.742 --> 47:53.866
But I'd love to be able to get in touch with you at some point.

47:53.886 --> 47:54.807
I'll give you my card.

48:01.255 --> 48:06.722
He's telling me about the records at the Archives of Salamanca.

48:08.002 --> 48:16.153
The orders were actually written by King Philip II, who was meticulous.

48:16.173 --> 48:18.436
They called him government by paper, as a matter of fact.

48:19.077 --> 48:26.888
And he wrote very complete orders to the manager of this archives, including when he would be open, fees he would charge, and so on.

48:26.908 --> 48:37.502
But also including specific orders that documents should be filed in sequence and joined together with red tape so that they would never get out of sequence.

48:37.938 --> 48:39.540
Germany in October.

48:39.860 --> 48:51.855
I went to the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, and a young man who was showing me around said something about, Frederick II demanded, stipulated that all government records be written on vellum.

48:51.875 --> 48:52.756
Are you familiar with that?

48:53.017 --> 48:56.621
And not paper, because that paper was more perishable.

48:56.681 --> 48:59.024
And I've been trying to document this darn thing.

48:59.044 --> 49:00.506
I'm just wondering, are you familiar with that?

49:01.027 --> 49:06.173
Well, I have some familiarity with that era, but I did my dissertation on it.

49:07.469 --> 49:11.528
first century of pretty much scientific stuff.

49:11.648 --> 49:15.366
But that one doesn't ring a bell.

49:16.330 --> 49:16.973
Okay.
