WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:05.958
kind of what we do, but with a lot of history thrown in.

00:06.599 --> 00:10.325
So, I'm actually going to... Okay, this is Susan?

00:10.545 --> 00:10.805
Yes.

00:11.727 --> 00:13.249
R-A-B-E, right?

00:13.349 --> 00:13.569
Yep.

00:14.190 --> 00:18.477
And your position, just for the plate here, is the title, I guess?

00:19.498 --> 00:22.122
Program Officer for Repository Collections.

00:22.302 --> 00:23.484
All right.

00:23.504 --> 00:28.392
And the reason why I'm starting back here... And back here being where?

00:29.113 --> 00:31.516
In our incoming receipts area.

00:31.636 --> 00:32.097
Okay.

00:32.431 --> 00:39.238
is to show you a little shelving from our original building at Cottage Grove.

00:39.798 --> 00:41.440
And how long have you been in this new facility?

00:43.101 --> 00:47.145
Let me retract here.

00:52.891 --> 00:58.536
Eight years in one section and 18 in the other.

00:58.556 --> 01:00.358
There's actually two different buildings.

01:00.438 --> 01:02.320
So this isn't a very recent move then?

01:02.587 --> 01:06.412
He was saying he moved two million books up here, like last year?

01:06.773 --> 01:13.061
No, it was about 94, I guess, that the move was.

01:13.081 --> 01:15.865
So the building's construction started in 92.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.026
I see, I see.

01:18.188 --> 01:20.511
You mean as an institution?

01:20.551 --> 01:22.093
Institution, yeah.

01:22.113 --> 01:23.054
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:23.114 --> 01:24.396
I was thinking in terms of the building.

01:24.536 --> 01:30.484
In our Cottage Grove building, which was our original building facility, we had

01:30.751 --> 01:42.965
storage shelf that were, at the time, in the 1950s, one of the first installations of compact storage.

01:42.985 --> 01:53.576
And the arrangement was a standing fixed shelf in the center with bays that swung open on either side.

01:53.596 --> 01:59.543
And the uniqueness compared to current facilities is that

01:59.978 --> 02:05.790
into the shelving, we could adjust the shelves on either side of each bay.

02:06.071 --> 02:21.042
So in some sections where we had small, short books, we actually had from the center a total of six sets of shelving.

02:21.477 --> 02:24.401
And then when you get larger books, you end up with only three.

02:24.882 --> 02:26.664
So we store by size here.

02:26.684 --> 02:32.872
We store by size, which you will see greatly.

02:33.413 --> 02:47.232
And when the Center was founded, the original impetus was the ten or so Midwestern library.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.582
The Big Ten type libraries?

02:49.602 --> 02:56.870
The Big Ten, and actually I'll start wanting to go one of the things we knew from Cottage Grove.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.091
Cottage Grove is where?

02:58.772 --> 03:03.697
Chicago.

03:03.857 --> 03:09.363
It's about six blocks west and about four blocks north of where we are right now.

03:09.383 --> 03:11.886
But our founding members are this group.

03:12.288 --> 03:24.646
University of Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Illinois, Indiana University, University of Iowa, University of Kansas, Michigan State, University of Minnesota, Northwestern, and Purdue.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.729
So it's not necessarily the Big Ten.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.413
It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

03:29.433 --> 03:32.758
Well, it is ten, but it's not the Big Ten, because Kansas is not a Big Ten school.

03:32.958 --> 03:41.991
And neither is the Illinois Institute of Technology, and the University of Chicago has its affiliation with all the Big Tens for their...

03:42.173 --> 03:42.754
Programs.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.956
Programs and such.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.117
Certainly not by football.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.639
Not anymore.

03:46.739 --> 03:47.160
Not ever.

03:47.701 --> 03:52.548
No, they did play a lot of them back in the days of Amos Alonzo's dad.

03:52.568 --> 03:53.289
Oh, they did.

03:53.649 --> 03:55.732
But not anymore.

03:55.752 --> 03:59.938
But they were running into a space conference after the war.

04:00.098 --> 04:02.882
I'm going to go upstairs where you're leaving.

04:02.902 --> 04:06.127
So this actually predates a lot of the off-site storage things.

04:06.187 --> 04:08.350
In fact, do you think this is the first one?

04:08.785 --> 04:15.995
I'm not necessarily sure that the first... I know Boston, I know Harvard, the BPO, used one in Boston.

04:16.516 --> 04:20.382
There was a consortial arrangement at least in the back of the 40s.

04:20.442 --> 04:26.170
Yeah, and that's roughly the same time because the center officially was founded in 1949.

04:26.290 --> 04:34.181
And then they, you know, started their, you know, what are we going to do?

04:34.302 --> 04:36.745
What's the purpose of this organization?

04:36.765 --> 04:38.067
Let's build a building.

04:38.452 --> 04:46.863
And so, really, the building and the production didn't start happening until the early 50s.

04:47.884 --> 04:49.366
Don't quote me on a date.

04:49.386 --> 04:50.888
I actually have something to give you.

04:50.908 --> 04:52.210
Oh, that's good.

04:52.230 --> 04:53.111
I'm really bad at dates.

04:53.271 --> 04:55.074
No, but I like things, and I need paper.

04:56.415 --> 05:00.020
And the, um, more license.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.383
Now, is this storage, or is this kind of transit here?

05:02.515 --> 05:04.177
This is actual story.

05:04.257 --> 05:07.260
Oh, and now we're looking at newspapers, the Rocky Mountain News, for instance.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.301
This is newspapers.

05:08.681 --> 05:10.182
And we're on the first floor now?

05:10.603 --> 05:20.512
We're on the fourth floor of Kenwood One, which was the seventh floor of our Cottage Grove facility.

05:20.532 --> 05:31.763
And the only reason that it's significant is the call numbers that we use throughout the building are really accession numbers.

05:32.435 --> 05:42.430
In two distinct cases, they were locators for the floor, row, and bay in the Cottage Grove building.

05:43.332 --> 05:45.575
So these have seven numbers.

05:46.356 --> 05:48.419
So you're actually saving the newspapers?

05:49.881 --> 05:52.826
Yes, as long as we don't have microfilm.

05:54.068 --> 05:56.692
Now, to show an example.

05:56.732 --> 06:00.838
I don't expect you can have microfilm on the Figaro and Irish Gentlewoman, right?

06:01.308 --> 06:04.013
Uh, no, but it probably exists.

06:04.033 --> 06:04.353
You think?

06:05.315 --> 06:06.477
Uh, for that one, yes.

06:07.138 --> 06:11.045
So, like, uh, this particular paper, Enson Bakita.

06:11.546 --> 06:15.753
Enson D-A-K-I with a little thing.

06:16.495 --> 06:17.056
K-A.

06:17.136 --> 06:17.276
Right.

06:18.218 --> 06:24.228
It's wrapped, probably because it's unbound, and... Brittle, do not circulate, it says.

06:24.248 --> 06:25.290
Circulate, which means it's...

06:25.675 --> 06:26.276
Humbling.

06:26.316 --> 06:38.331
If someone asked for this, if we couldn't supply them a specific article that we could photocopy, we would either purchase microfilm if it existed, and I guess it does not.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.293
It's fairly, it's not that old, 1953.

06:40.654 --> 06:44.759
No, but given the pile of it then, I would guess this is a Turkish newspaper.

06:46.001 --> 06:46.842
Published where, do you think?

06:48.364 --> 06:53.770
Most of our Turkish newspapers are from the Istanbul... So it is Turkish-Turkish.

06:53.790 --> 06:55.092
Turkish-Turkish, yeah.

06:55.527 --> 07:22.024
and um so who would have turned who would have sent this over to you i'm not sure you sent us the turkish newspapers to be honest but someone had a collection that's roughly various localities and turkeys in the 50s and if we couldn't find film which is highly likely for this we will microfilm it ourselves you will for the at some point or if someone requests it i mean long term we have to do it

07:22.443 --> 07:26.268
But if an immediate request comes, we will attempt to fill the request.

07:26.288 --> 07:27.610
Are all the newspapers in here?

07:28.692 --> 07:29.533
Or is there more?

07:31.355 --> 07:32.617
Except for the ones on Microfilm.

07:32.697 --> 07:34.720
That's what I mean.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.483
The artifacts... Are here.

07:36.663 --> 07:37.043
Are here.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.867
Do you have a feel, do you have an idea of what's here?

07:40.929 --> 07:50.763
It's a combination of both general circulation newspapers, such as the Rocky Mountain News from the United States, foreign newspapers, and then U.S.

07:50.843 --> 07:51.724
ethnic press.

07:52.227 --> 07:58.215
I mean, in terms of numbers, in terms of... Probably 30,000 volumes.

08:02.021 --> 08:02.121
Hmm.

08:02.141 --> 08:11.233
But titles, I really... So you really... Do you think these institutions... How many institutions are there in the consortium now?

08:11.253 --> 08:12.715
You had 10 to start with?

08:12.736 --> 08:13.717
We had 10 to start.

08:13.737 --> 08:14.638
Approximately.

08:14.658 --> 08:16.100
There's approximately 100 voting members.

08:16.120 --> 08:16.260
100.

08:16.280 --> 08:21.227
Another 20 or so associate members.

08:21.247 --> 08:21.728
And then...

08:21.944 --> 08:36.784
Two of those voting members are actually large consortia groups themselves, one being OhioLink, which means the higher education institutions in Ohio, and the other is Orbis, which is the Pacific Northwest.

08:36.804 --> 08:38.907
You have the Greek National Herald there.

08:39.307 --> 08:42.351
Yeah, which is actually Ethico Curis.

08:43.172 --> 08:43.553
Is what?

08:44.134 --> 08:47.378
It's really this title in Greek.

08:49.113 --> 08:49.994
So that's a U.S.

08:50.014 --> 08:50.915
ethnic press.

08:50.936 --> 08:55.462
So that's A-K-A, Ethnikus, E-T-H-N-I.

08:56.163 --> 09:00.168
Don't expect to see this in print, but I... K-E-R-U-X, right?

09:00.288 --> 09:00.549
Right.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.673
Okay.

09:03.693 --> 09:12.225
And a lot of the newsprint, though I'm not sure about the Turkish, actually came from the University of Illinois as one of the founding members.

09:12.646 --> 09:18.073
When they were trying to find space in their library, this is one of the things that...

09:18.897 --> 09:20.800
But you don't take everything.

09:21.541 --> 09:21.841
No.

09:22.001 --> 09:27.469
You are not an off-site storage facility for these hundred-odd... No.

09:27.489 --> 09:29.592
And we have to make that clear.

09:29.613 --> 09:33.558
It's not like Harvard can decide to send this out to HD and it goes there.

09:33.678 --> 09:42.471
There's no mediation in deciding, well, this is a title... There is a mediation, but it's very esoteric.

09:42.611 --> 09:44.915
Originally... Your mediation is very esoteric.

09:44.935 --> 09:45.175
Yeah.

09:45.560 --> 09:51.428
Originally, we were really an off-site storage facility in the founding years.

09:51.488 --> 09:55.513
We were taking materials that people were no longer using.

09:55.533 --> 10:08.510
The only difference from many of the off-site storage facilities is we would not take multiple copies in the sense of if we got it from one member, we did not take someone else's copy.

10:08.530 --> 10:11.954
What if their copy was a better copy?

10:11.974 --> 10:13.616
It was basically a judgment call.

10:13.636 --> 10:14.217
I mean, you know...

10:14.534 --> 10:16.537
Don't be shy.

10:16.637 --> 10:18.620
I know what they're doing out in Colorado.

10:18.720 --> 10:25.731
They get five places, and it's basically they're creating a new library, and they're only going to take one copy, and they're going to get rid of all the others.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.194
I said, but are you going to try and keep the best one?

10:28.214 --> 10:29.716
He said, well, if they all come in at the same time.

10:30.257 --> 10:36.406
But as a practical matter, though, I can tell you, once the copy's in there, that's the copy that's there.

10:36.727 --> 10:44.338
And, you know, when people offer things now, one of the things we do is go look and see what we have so that if

10:44.825 --> 10:54.077
You know, we find something that through use the binding has broken or it's been lost or it's gotten really ratty.

10:54.598 --> 10:56.440
We will take the new copy.

10:56.901 --> 10:59.665
Is condition a constant consideration?

10:59.765 --> 11:05.913
Is it something that you're... It's kept in the back of our mind that it's probably not kept... Top priority.

11:06.073 --> 11:08.356
Top priority, unfortunately.

11:08.897 --> 11:14.224
But anyway, they had this idea of, you know, let's have an off-site storage facility.

11:14.795 --> 11:18.638
And that's largely what the initial collection focus was.

11:18.999 --> 11:22.321
Well, then, you know, they got things cleared out.

11:22.742 --> 11:24.643
And they went, well, so what should we do now?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.206
We have this seven-story building in Chicago.

11:27.246 --> 11:28.887
How should we fill it up?

11:28.907 --> 11:37.314
So then they started changing the focus to be doing active subscriptions and collection growing.

11:37.475 --> 11:43.840
So they started adding new things like newspaper subscriptions on microfilm and major microform sets.

11:44.309 --> 11:50.017
and rarely held cereals, rarely held in the United States.

11:50.037 --> 11:52.941
And that's what we focus on more now.

11:53.522 --> 12:04.557
And in doing the deposit storage facility aspect now, we still focus on the rarely held or rarely used.

12:04.577 --> 12:04.677
Okay.

12:05.318 --> 12:07.962
And not so much on the commonly held.

12:08.843 --> 12:12.428
So this is all, these are all, there's your catalog number.

12:12.528 --> 12:12.949
Right.

12:13.942 --> 12:19.728
And so if somebody wants one of these, you have to open it up and take it out and reseal it again.

12:19.968 --> 12:22.711
But from what I could see, most of these pretty much stay sealed.

12:23.392 --> 12:24.073
Pretty much.

12:24.974 --> 12:27.076
It isn't likely to be an immediate run-on.

12:27.276 --> 12:28.758
That's why they get here in the first place.

12:29.118 --> 12:34.804
There are some titles that are constantly circulating, for example... At which point you think, why are they here?

12:34.904 --> 12:41.451
Maybe if they're constantly circulating... Well, constantly circulating for us and constantly circulating...

12:41.785 --> 12:47.871
in another library are vastly different concepts.

12:47.891 --> 12:49.252
So what is constantly circulating?

12:49.513 --> 12:50.373
The New York Sun.

12:50.694 --> 12:55.038
So in terms of what would you consider a constantly circulating figure?

12:57.060 --> 13:02.105
Figure's hard to say, because what we're seeing is a title is constantly.

13:02.125 --> 13:06.029
Well, that's what I mean, but if it's used once, it's probably constantly circulating.

13:06.049 --> 13:10.273
I'm teasing, but... No, but it's more along the line of the newspaper,

13:10.675 --> 13:19.063
There's probably anywhere from, say, 10 to 30 requests for that particular newspaper title.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.344
That's pretty good.

13:20.604 --> 13:31.475
So it might be varying volumes, and it might be for the same person who's doing a research project that gets them into that newspaper, and they just are asking for each.

13:31.495 --> 13:34.498
So you even send these to the institution?

13:34.598 --> 13:35.839
Yes.

13:35.859 --> 13:37.240
Do they pay for each?

13:37.260 --> 13:37.881
Is there a fee?

13:38.081 --> 13:39.062
Not for members.

13:39.278 --> 13:48.349
That's part of their membership, is that once they request something like this, the only additional cost that they incur is sending it back.

13:48.369 --> 13:48.689
I see.

13:50.652 --> 13:53.956
We cover the cost of shipping it to them.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.277
What's the turnaround, generally?

13:56.639 --> 14:01.805
Generally, 24 to 48 hours, depending upon what it is.

14:01.825 --> 14:02.626
Do you FedEx things?

14:02.646 --> 14:03.467
You must.

14:04.228 --> 14:05.269
It varies.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.412
Our standard shipping is UPS.

14:07.477 --> 14:12.105
The West Coast gets a standard shipping of UPS Second Day Air.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.088
And you pick up the expense on that?

14:14.108 --> 14:15.891
And we pick up the expense on that.

14:16.051 --> 14:20.599
And we have a couple other groups who have done specialized courier arrangements.

14:20.639 --> 14:22.302
And they'll pay for that?

14:22.382 --> 14:27.370
And we pay for that within the group contract.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.075
We're just one more library in that group contract.

14:30.629 --> 14:31.290
Okay.

14:31.310 --> 14:32.913
So it does work out nicely.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.996
I'm going to take a stem this way, actually.

14:35.617 --> 14:37.059
I'm eager to see books and stuff.

14:37.079 --> 14:37.319
Yeah.

14:37.580 --> 14:41.426
I'm flying out today, so I'm hoping we should be able to do this in about an hour, do you think?

14:41.446 --> 14:41.987
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:42.227 --> 14:48.917
I will just point out this row happens to be an odd little row.

14:49.078 --> 14:53.785
Someone who was eventually affiliated with the University of Illinois because they're the

14:54.355 --> 14:59.702
University who deposited this, wandered around Western Europe right after World War II.

14:59.722 --> 15:00.663
That's a cute story.

15:00.843 --> 15:01.344
I like that.

15:01.784 --> 15:05.649
And collected newspapers.

15:05.669 --> 15:06.530
So we have... Who's collected?

15:06.711 --> 15:07.552
Or she?

15:07.592 --> 15:08.012
Whoever.

15:08.753 --> 15:17.825
French, German, Dutch, Belgium, and I think that's basically it.

15:18.045 --> 15:22.911
You know, roughly late 45, maybe up into 1947,

15:25.034 --> 15:26.916
all around, you know, Northwestern Europe.

15:26.936 --> 15:28.477
And you can see they were all 40s.

15:30.279 --> 15:31.740
Post, immediate post-war.

15:32.861 --> 15:33.842
Post-war.

15:33.862 --> 15:36.865
And so it gets a, uh... Elsevres, La France.

15:37.546 --> 15:39.107
Yeah, this is a little French pile.

15:43.151 --> 15:43.291
Uh-huh.

15:43.311 --> 15:48.476
And, uh... And what happened is this individual probably kept them at the university until that person either died or retired.

15:48.516 --> 15:52.780
And then nobody, and used them in their curricula or whatever.

15:53.435 --> 15:56.037
And then that course went out where that person went.

15:56.057 --> 15:56.518
That's right.

15:56.818 --> 15:57.879
And we don't need these anymore.

15:57.899 --> 15:59.080
So that's what happens, right?

15:59.140 --> 15:59.401
Yes.

15:59.441 --> 16:00.502
And I bet that happens a lot.

16:00.822 --> 16:02.203
Yes.

16:02.223 --> 16:03.404
So we have Austrian, too.

16:03.424 --> 16:05.466
I didn't quite realize we had Austrian.

16:06.127 --> 16:08.289
So this is this person's row, you think?

16:08.349 --> 16:09.530
Basically, yes.

16:09.971 --> 16:10.911
Lots of little piles.

16:10.931 --> 16:11.752
Lots of stuff.

16:11.772 --> 16:12.273
Cute.

16:12.293 --> 16:13.914
Do you have a name for it?

16:13.934 --> 16:16.397
No.

16:16.417 --> 16:17.718
Is there ever any call for it?

16:19.499 --> 16:20.100
Not.

16:20.755 --> 16:22.658
A lot yet.

16:23.138 --> 16:42.225
Part of the difference with this group is that while we had it cataloged in our card catalog, this is among the last materials that we have been working on, on our effort to get all of our foreign newspapers cataloged online.

16:42.245 --> 16:45.750
And so, largely because

16:46.979 --> 16:56.027
While we knew we had a range of dates, we didn't know exactly what we had, and so they are... It pretty much looks like 46, 45 to 46 is what it looks like.

16:56.147 --> 16:56.767
Right.

16:56.927 --> 17:04.674
There's a few that go to 47, but I feel like, you know, here's a Polish newspaper that's from The Hague.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.336
Hmm.

17:07.356 --> 17:12.441
So you can see some of the, you know... I wonder what he was collecting.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.202
I'm not saying he, but it's a generic.

17:14.222 --> 17:16.564
It could be anyone, but... Yeah, yeah.

17:16.932 --> 17:21.138
And this is just our standard microfiche storage area.

17:21.178 --> 17:26.465
Do you take things in as collections, like as this is clearly one individual's collection, and do you keep it?

17:26.525 --> 17:28.889
And once you do that, do you keep them as a collection?

17:29.209 --> 17:34.637
We generally don't keep them as collections, but we have a few things that came in as collections.

17:34.657 --> 17:40.825
Are these working artifacts, or are they... These are actually working artifacts, but not the way you think.

17:40.845 --> 17:42.548
This is where we store our mother cards.

17:42.688 --> 17:43.449
These are wooden.

17:43.609 --> 17:45.792
These are the old, wonderful carwood and oak.

17:46.362 --> 17:47.705
Card catalogs, yeah.

17:48.086 --> 17:52.415
But they're the right size for this lovely format micro cards.

17:55.501 --> 18:03.257
And also there's another little format called Ultra Fiche, which is a little bit smaller Fiche size.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.695
and it just happened to sit in the card catalog.

18:05.755 --> 18:13.502
So are these yours originally, or are they from one of your... Actually, I don't think any of these are ours originally, with a possible exception of this one.

18:13.522 --> 18:14.804
Yeah, well, the ugly one.

18:14.824 --> 18:16.105
They're really wonderful ones.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.026
Yeah, yeah.

18:17.086 --> 18:17.366
The antiques.

18:17.847 --> 18:18.968
Don't they have to be great?

18:19.528 --> 18:23.392
Most of these, I would guess, are either from the University of Chicago or Northwestern.

18:23.412 --> 18:25.614
I know some of them are from Northwestern.

18:25.634 --> 18:26.194
They're wonderful.

18:28.316 --> 18:32.080
I'd take this one off your head for a second.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.962
My wife would go crazy.

18:34.062 --> 18:37.166
Oh, God, he's brought home some more junk.

18:37.387 --> 18:40.371
But, you know, it's adaptive technology.

18:41.092 --> 18:42.534
Adaptive technology.

18:43.475 --> 18:44.076
Is that yours?

18:44.657 --> 18:45.758
I just made it up.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.981
I like it.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.105
You mean your card catalog from something else.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.027
Adaptive.

18:52.387 --> 18:53.208
Nice.

18:53.228 --> 19:01.780
I actually, someone was asking about use of old card catalog that someone put up on the web a picture.

19:02.519 --> 19:14.771
where they had taken the case, took out all the drawers, refinished it, and made it their bar.

19:14.791 --> 19:21.118
So this is compact shelving, which I would say is de rigueur basically through most of the facility, right?

19:21.138 --> 19:22.139
Yes, it is now.

19:22.159 --> 19:24.421
And it stores the bulk of our collection.

19:24.461 --> 19:27.684
See, look at this.

19:27.704 --> 19:28.325
This is huge.

19:28.345 --> 19:28.425
Yes.

19:29.097 --> 19:32.101
If you really want a mileage number, I can find one for you.

19:32.161 --> 19:32.622
I'd like one.

19:33.603 --> 19:37.188
Do you have any idea of how many of these units you have?

19:37.929 --> 19:45.340
Not how many units, but overall I think we now have 50 miles of shelves.

19:45.460 --> 19:46.501
I would have expected more.

19:47.563 --> 19:48.644
But actually, that's a lot.

19:49.425 --> 19:50.267
That's a lot.

19:50.547 --> 19:58.378
If the Strand Bookstore in New York claims 10 miles of shelves and they say they've got 2 million books, 50 miles should...

19:58.713 --> 20:01.056
And particularly when you do it in compact storage.

20:01.136 --> 20:05.601
Now, what we're seeing right now is not really compact storage.

20:06.702 --> 20:08.425
This collection is our U.S.

20:08.465 --> 20:09.846
State Documents collection.

20:09.886 --> 20:10.367
This is huge.

20:10.707 --> 20:17.615
Which is in the process of getting readings and the accessions.

20:18.396 --> 20:25.665
Part of our review of the collections and what are we going to do with the collection, because this collection is uncatalogued,

20:26.135 --> 20:47.437
It involved a long process of consulting with their members, consulting with state documents librarians, and coming to the conclusion that the materials from 1951 forward are more widely held, and therefore not an appropriate use of the Center's facilities for our members.

20:47.557 --> 20:54.825
So we are keeping the 1950 and earlier documents, with one exception, we are keeping all of our House and Senate journals

20:55.615 --> 20:57.317
Which end in roughly 1990.

20:57.337 --> 20:59.220
How many square feet in this building?

20:59.580 --> 21:00.501
You must have a figure.

21:01.102 --> 21:03.966
It's going to be on that piece of paper.

21:03.986 --> 21:06.109
That's going to be on that piece of paper that I'm going to give you.

21:06.589 --> 21:09.113
So this is foreign documents open.

21:09.553 --> 21:10.575
Open meaning what?

21:10.855 --> 21:13.078
Meaning it's open shelving.

21:13.098 --> 21:13.819
It's not compact.

21:13.919 --> 21:22.230
So the materials are sitting on a shelf with a little bit of a fine space for each title.

21:22.497 --> 21:27.904
and they're not nice and neatly stacked by side onto an appropriate size row.

21:27.924 --> 21:29.286
And you said it's not catalogued.

21:29.846 --> 21:31.228
This particular portion is catalogued.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.170
So how do we know what's here?

21:33.190 --> 21:50.412
We have a locator system, which is essentially a card catalog with short entries so that for the material we're looking at, it will be under India, a particular Indian state, a keyword access to the

21:50.560 --> 22:09.140
agency that issues the document and then title, and it will give something like, in this particular case, budget from 1974 to 1980-81 in brackets because we don't have a complete holdings list.

22:09.180 --> 22:17.108
This area is actually being compacted and put into a compact location and in the process also being cataloged.

22:17.155 --> 22:29.348
so that we gain the shelf space and we also take care of the cataloging problem and the knowledge of exact holdings at the same time.

22:29.488 --> 22:32.411
I was just looking so I can go right away.

22:32.431 --> 22:33.452
Go ahead.

22:34.973 --> 22:35.073
Okay.

22:35.093 --> 22:43.702
I'm going to skip one section because all this is an additional space for something that's actually more in another place.

22:43.722 --> 22:45.424
And the other thing that we have here

22:45.725 --> 22:53.893
is materials that we received from the Library of Congress field offices in South and Southeast Asia in terms of monographs.

22:53.913 --> 22:59.619
We were getting materials from them from the mid-'60s to roughly 1983.

23:01.681 --> 23:06.265
Any time you stop something, there are many stragglers that come through.

23:06.286 --> 23:12.812
And while this is somewhat compact in the sense that the shelves are more or less

23:13.062 --> 23:17.026
full without additional space for additional volumes to go in.

23:17.546 --> 23:23.512
It is not compact in the sense that the height has been adjusted.

23:23.812 --> 23:24.953
Now, whose number is this?

23:24.973 --> 23:26.455
Is this LC's number, or is this your number?

23:26.475 --> 23:28.717
That is the Library of Congress card number.

23:29.137 --> 23:39.627
This material came with—oh, good, I have one, but it doesn't have— came with Library of Congress cataloging cards stapled inside.

23:40.012 --> 23:43.655
And we just used the LC card number as a locator.

23:43.675 --> 23:57.267
Now this particular item, which is people in institutions of India in Hindi, is something that we have put online because it has a barcode on it.

23:57.287 --> 23:57.727
I noticed.

23:59.029 --> 24:08.837
And what we did in terms of our econ was we sent out the materials to OCLC, the Bibliography Utility, and said,

24:09.442 --> 24:16.891
for anything that's not in English, search it by this card number, find it, sign, add it, and if you don't, send it back.

24:17.712 --> 24:24.400
At that time they were not, they didn't have the staff that they do now who can do many of these languages.

24:25.682 --> 24:26.723
But that's your barcode.

24:27.124 --> 24:30.368
That's our barcode.

24:31.329 --> 24:33.692
But that goes to OCLC too.

24:33.952 --> 24:36.495
Yes.

24:39.260 --> 24:47.428
At the time, they did a fairly good job of it in the sense of how much was available for them to add or how they used to.

24:47.989 --> 25:06.347
And we also had the experience of, because we had copied all of our cards, and we could tell when they got to a new letter in the alphabet because the South Asian material started circulating.

25:07.930 --> 25:09.311
And how many floors in this building?

25:09.392 --> 25:15.018
There are four, with materials actually only being shelved on the trees.

25:15.038 --> 25:18.942
So this building is probably good, I think, for another ten years, is that right?

25:19.322 --> 25:20.063
Approximately ten years.

25:20.083 --> 25:20.624
It's huge.

25:20.764 --> 25:21.424
Oh, God.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.488
And what are you holding here, about two and a half million?

25:25.529 --> 25:32.616
Probably closer to three and a half to four if you include microfilm equipment.

25:32.937 --> 25:35.720
This is gasoline, I have to say.

25:35.740 --> 25:37.802
Three and a half to four million.

25:38.086 --> 25:39.789
if you include microfilm equipment.

25:39.809 --> 25:40.831
Right.

25:40.851 --> 25:50.370
And it was actually up to a little over five million, but with the deaccessioning the state dock, that's reducing the damage.

25:50.590 --> 25:56.061
We kind of call with our ice cube trays, not only for the look, but we do keep it

25:56.210 --> 26:05.962
So this does have elements of off-site storage facilities.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.065
Is there a preservation element here?

26:09.226 --> 26:11.229
Not as big as it should be.

26:11.749 --> 26:22.082
Our main preservation activity is keeping the stacks cooler and at a steady humidity so that we don't have the fluctuations

26:22.400 --> 26:24.743
that you'll have in a normal library.

26:25.184 --> 26:35.797
Also, unless staff are working here and we're doing tours, most of the lights are off when the staff come up and we do our things and then we go and turn the lights off.

26:35.817 --> 26:43.707
So we reduce a lot of the wear and tear that you'd see in a normal library.

26:44.188 --> 26:49.234
Also, it's unlikely, particularly with the touring, that you're going to see any staff up here.

26:49.298 --> 27:07.140
which is why we didn't go for mechanized compact storage, which is, there's not enough people to worry about somebody coming up and starting to close them, because you can always yell.

27:07.760 --> 27:18.934
We do have kind of unique usage of our compact storage for our microfilm, and this is the legacy of our private growth building, because the shelving units that we had there

27:19.184 --> 27:21.727
They were already boxed.

27:21.787 --> 27:28.034
So you just pulled out the Phoenix Gazette as an example.

27:28.054 --> 27:28.254
Right.

27:29.215 --> 27:41.109
And the boxing allowed us to move the materials fairly easy because they could just move boxes.

27:41.269 --> 27:43.892
Can you just see by looking at this who this came in from?

27:44.092 --> 27:46.818
This was actually a subscription that we started.

27:46.838 --> 27:47.300
Oh, I see.

27:47.380 --> 27:48.282
Okay, so this was yours.

27:48.623 --> 27:56.140
But when you look at an item, can you tell immediately where it came from, or does it all become part of this one page?

27:56.421 --> 28:01.493
For the most part, it just becomes part of the whole thing.

28:02.215 --> 28:03.756
This is a synergistic collection.

28:04.217 --> 28:07.059
It's not ours.

28:07.139 --> 28:07.660
It is yours.

28:07.740 --> 28:11.924
You're not holding it in trust to these individuals.

28:11.984 --> 28:13.125
You are doing it as one.

28:14.086 --> 28:15.367
We started that way.

28:15.867 --> 28:25.976
Initially, there were four types of deposit, which I can only remember three, which basically consisted of, well, if this doesn't work out, we want our stuff back.

28:27.538 --> 28:31.041
If it doesn't work out, we want you to ask us if we want our stuff back.

28:31.578 --> 28:35.723
And if it doesn't work out, we don't want our stuff back.

28:35.743 --> 28:36.865
You don't know the fourth?

28:37.365 --> 28:38.507
And I don't know the fourth.

28:38.527 --> 28:43.253
I never, you know, because it's some kind of weird little combination of those three.

28:43.273 --> 28:44.495
Well, I like those three, actually.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.477
You know, I mean, and then, you know.

28:46.838 --> 28:49.261
But I would have thought, I don't want the stuff back would be number one.

28:50.342 --> 28:51.604
Well, I mean, it may have been.

28:53.126 --> 28:55.909
And then, you know, later on as we became family.

28:55.929 --> 28:58.733
Because let's face it, if you weren't here, a lot of this stuff wouldn't.

28:59.219 --> 29:01.863
have gone to the landfill or whatever else.

29:02.484 --> 29:05.608
Or they would have been building their own storage libraries a lot sooner.

29:05.949 --> 29:08.572
Yeah.

29:09.113 --> 29:11.256
I personally think something would have been invented.

29:11.276 --> 29:14.781
And a lot of your members do have their own storage units.

29:14.801 --> 29:15.262
Yes, they do.

29:15.342 --> 29:20.109
You know, Michigan or, I mean, all these schools have lots of storage units.

29:20.129 --> 29:22.392
Not all of them, but that's clearly there.

29:22.813 --> 29:25.176
But anyway, you know, we had...

29:25.493 --> 29:29.177
things in boxes, and we needed to move it quickly.

29:29.278 --> 29:32.802
So are these microfilms, are they of some scarcity?

29:33.062 --> 29:33.743
Do they exist?

29:33.823 --> 29:34.544
Some are.

29:34.644 --> 29:36.827
Even microfilm copies are scarce too, right?

29:37.187 --> 29:38.148
It depends on what they are.

29:38.168 --> 29:43.515
Obviously the Phoenix Gazette is not going to be one of them that's scarce.

29:43.535 --> 29:52.986
But something like... Yes, a good example would be... the Phoenix Gazette is going to be...

29:53.557 --> 29:59.043
Something like The Life of Reverend Joel Hawes in its second edition.

29:59.583 --> 30:00.784
But that's not a newspaper, is it?

30:00.844 --> 30:01.745
That's not a newspaper.

30:01.785 --> 30:03.667
That's a monograph that's been filmed.

30:03.687 --> 30:06.630
So these are monographs that have been filmed.

30:06.650 --> 30:17.622
And my guess is probably that either our print copy was lost or it was in such condition that it couldn't circulate anymore.

30:17.642 --> 30:19.083
And that is, what was it again?

30:19.163 --> 30:21.045
Edward Lawrence?

30:21.105 --> 30:22.787
I've heard of him.

30:23.527 --> 30:29.977
Do you have a catalog that is accessible?

30:30.658 --> 30:32.862
We do have an online catalog.

30:33.423 --> 30:34.585
Not everything is in it.

30:35.466 --> 30:39.953
If I want to get some sample, how do I do that?

30:39.993 --> 30:42.137
Do I have to look for a subject?

30:43.018 --> 30:48.066
You can look by subject.

30:49.193 --> 30:51.475
Actually, I'll show you when we get back downstairs.

30:51.515 --> 30:51.655
Okay.

30:51.675 --> 30:52.716
Just give me a website.

30:52.736 --> 30:55.579
I don't know what happened.

30:55.739 --> 31:09.851
And then, like, this particular set, which is a commercially available set from South Africa, is on the Anglo-World War and also Chinese labor, again, from the same time period.

31:10.912 --> 31:17.158
Its rarity is probably that there's one or possibly

31:17.543 --> 31:21.108
two coffees in this country.

31:21.128 --> 31:23.171
Even though it's microfilm.

31:23.191 --> 31:24.613
Even though it's microfilm.

31:26.856 --> 31:26.977
Sorry.

31:26.997 --> 31:31.263
It's like the fact that this stand is not done.

31:31.283 --> 31:36.470
This is actually owned by the Crawford and I have a microfilm project.

31:36.751 --> 31:46.605
And so we've removed from the things that are more commonly held but not easily

31:46.838 --> 31:47.579
Loaned.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.663
So this is becoming a rare book collection, isn't it?

31:52.584 --> 31:54.986
Rare in the sense of... Scarce book collection.

31:55.126 --> 31:57.309
Scarce book is a better, not rare.

31:57.449 --> 31:57.949
Not rare.

31:57.969 --> 31:58.810
No, that's a good line.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.231
This is a scarce book collection.

32:01.233 --> 32:02.073
I'll coin that.

32:02.093 --> 32:02.794
Is that okay?

32:02.814 --> 32:04.115
Yeah, that's okay.

32:04.135 --> 32:07.679
I know there are many things that are more likely to help.

32:07.699 --> 32:10.522
Yeah, but if they are, you don't really want them.

32:10.542 --> 32:15.647
Not anymore, except in efforts...

32:16.100 --> 32:22.049
where we can convince our members that if we have it, then they can deaccession their multiple copies.

32:22.490 --> 32:30.622
And we do have two projects where we're trying to do that, superseded reference books, and we are starting to take in the materials held in JSTOR.

32:30.803 --> 32:32.545
Yes.

32:33.006 --> 32:38.935
In fact, that's how I made this with Kevin suggested.

32:39.185 --> 32:42.490
So that's kind of going back to our original purpose.

32:42.510 --> 32:46.575
Because I said to him, once you copy these things, are you getting rid of them?

32:46.635 --> 32:49.459
Well, I said, we're not going to keep them, if that's the short answer.

32:49.519 --> 32:53.825
But, you know, the amplified answer is we're going to send them to Chicago.

32:53.845 --> 32:55.207
And they've agreed to take them.

32:55.247 --> 32:56.008
So that's great.

32:56.028 --> 32:56.950
And I think that's wonderful.

32:57.190 --> 33:05.842
And then in the process, then, we're going to also try and convince our members that now that we have the print, you don't need to keep your copy.

33:05.862 --> 33:06.002
Mm-hmm.

33:07.012 --> 33:15.144
And I imagine there will be some members who this will be no problem and they'll be able to get rid of things.

33:16.245 --> 33:22.815
Other members will be able to get rid of that title and they won't be able to get rid of that title, but maybe they will.

33:22.835 --> 33:23.256
That's fine.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.279
They are libraries after all.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.305
This is another legacy location.

33:29.325 --> 33:30.266
This is the fifth floor.

33:30.586 --> 33:33.070
Legacy meaning what?

33:34.096 --> 33:36.979
Call number based on the Cottage Group building.

33:37.039 --> 33:38.820
So legacy, it came with you.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.481
It was baggage.

33:39.781 --> 33:41.643
It's baggage, yeah.

33:41.823 --> 33:43.745
You call it legacy, I call it baggage.

33:43.765 --> 33:44.326
It's baggage.

33:45.907 --> 33:54.995
And it's basically just the fifth floor of the Cottage Group building was a compacted foreign document.

33:55.035 --> 33:55.836
Grandfathered in.

33:56.377 --> 33:58.138
Grandfathered in.

33:59.139 --> 34:00.621
That's a special question.

34:00.641 --> 34:00.981
Foreign document.

34:01.096 --> 34:02.597
Foreign documents.

34:02.617 --> 34:11.205
We actually have, except on micro-format, almost no U.S.

34:11.225 --> 34:12.006
national documents.

34:12.026 --> 34:13.007
And you shouldn't have to.

34:13.087 --> 34:16.010
Any number of depositories that have them.

34:16.270 --> 34:29.282
We do actually have two real archival collections, which are the memory-graphed transcripts from the International Military Tribunals.

34:29.302 --> 34:29.702
Ooh.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.107
both for Nuremberg and the Far East.

34:34.048 --> 34:37.152
This is actually from subsequent proceedings.

34:44.262 --> 34:48.608
This is where they're deposited, the Nuremberg stuff?

34:49.129 --> 34:50.431
This is one of the copies.

34:51.693 --> 34:56.820
Most of this material has also been microfilmed by the National Archives.

34:57.070 --> 35:10.101
It's called Subsequent Proceedings in Irma, called Subsequent Proceedings.

35:11.887 --> 35:18.817
And this is all, these are... There's mimeographs, there are some photographs, and they're in the evidence areas.

35:18.837 --> 35:23.264
Now, one of the institutions, again, had this as a... University of Chicago had it.

35:23.284 --> 35:24.626
Chicago had it.

35:24.646 --> 35:32.537
Someone at the law school was one of the... Members of the tribunal problem with that.

35:32.557 --> 35:33.138
Makes sense.

35:33.158 --> 35:34.019
And they sent it on.

35:36.483 --> 35:38.285
Legislative state documents.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.729
College catalog... Worcester Academy?

35:41.620 --> 35:44.222
My two daughters went to Worcester Academy.

35:44.242 --> 35:45.243
Oh, they're going to love this.

35:46.264 --> 35:46.724
You're kidding.

35:46.885 --> 35:48.586
What are you doing with Worcester Academy?

35:48.946 --> 35:52.429
We have probably the largest collection of U.S.

35:52.870 --> 35:53.570
college cabinets.

35:53.590 --> 35:54.391
This is not a college.

35:54.411 --> 35:57.113
This is a high school, a private school.

35:57.154 --> 36:10.345
Well, and where we have places like Worcester Academy is we also included college preparatory type schools, which is what Worcester Academy is.

36:10.865 --> 36:13.088
And you've got Worcester Polytech, which is a college.

36:13.128 --> 36:14.230
It's not Worcester Academy.

36:14.250 --> 36:14.891
There's a difference.

36:14.991 --> 36:15.191
Yeah.

36:15.572 --> 36:17.555
Now, these are what?

36:17.615 --> 36:18.556
College catalogs.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.199
But this is hard-bound.

36:20.519 --> 36:22.221
Yeah, well, someone bought them.

36:22.642 --> 36:23.483
And then they sent it into this.

36:23.503 --> 36:24.124
Course catalogs.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.346
Course catalogs.

36:25.526 --> 36:26.407
This is great.

36:26.808 --> 36:28.731
I think this is really great.

36:28.831 --> 36:29.572
Yeah, I really do.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.316
It also includes...

36:32.482 --> 36:37.909
A lot of people think this is great.

36:37.989 --> 36:38.910
I think it's great.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.772
It's like people throw away phone books.

36:40.792 --> 36:43.315
Phone books are fantastic resources, don't you think?

36:43.335 --> 36:44.617
Yeah.

36:44.637 --> 36:48.902
I'm an amateur genealogist, so I love phone books.

36:49.783 --> 37:00.396
The emphasis is the course catalog, but we will also include in the collection the presidential

37:00.798 --> 37:24.780
reports treasurer's reports of the institution but that's why look at this look at this that's a you know you could take that you could sell that for serious money in worcester you know i mean that's a worcester school of design 1858 academy of fine arts and pretty darn good may i that's your condition i'm good don't worry i know what i'm doing my pen is over here

37:26.330 --> 37:29.733
Actually, the cover's probably the worst part of it.

37:29.753 --> 37:29.853
Yeah.

37:29.873 --> 37:30.674
That's fantastic.

37:30.754 --> 37:32.055
July 1858.

37:32.255 --> 37:32.576
Wow.

37:32.856 --> 37:35.539
I probably shouldn't show you this.

37:35.559 --> 37:36.980
This is from New York Public.

37:39.162 --> 37:42.125
Well, so New York Public had these.

37:42.325 --> 37:42.525
Yeah.

37:42.565 --> 37:43.045
The whole thing?

37:43.326 --> 37:43.906
It doesn't matter.

37:43.946 --> 37:45.167
Yeah, yeah.

37:45.187 --> 37:47.470
What in the world were they doing with a hardbound?

37:47.690 --> 37:49.612
How did New York Publics get out here?

37:49.932 --> 37:52.094
Well, New York Public is a member of the Center.

37:52.334 --> 37:52.514
Oh.

37:53.455 --> 37:55.577
The Research Library is a member of the Center.

37:56.047 --> 37:57.930
Uh, they can't do it.

37:57.950 --> 37:58.911
So then we, you know.

37:58.931 --> 37:59.572
Worcester State?

37:59.632 --> 38:00.453
You know Worcester here.

38:00.513 --> 38:01.535
This is unbelievable.

38:02.316 --> 38:03.518
Worcester State College?

38:03.958 --> 38:06.842
This is unreal that I could, but Worcester YMCA?

38:07.844 --> 38:14.493
So you go from Worcester Academy to Worcester Art Museum School to Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science.

38:14.514 --> 38:16.777
This is fantastic.

38:16.797 --> 38:17.678
Uh, the Domestic Science School.

38:18.900 --> 38:21.283
I'm just cueing myself where this is, so.

38:23.166 --> 38:23.927
So it, uh,

38:24.818 --> 38:27.020
Carboys go local angle, isn't there?

38:27.040 --> 38:29.622
People are not looking for it.

38:29.642 --> 38:36.288
And we also have a foreign college catalog collection, but not nearly as complete as the U.S.

38:36.308 --> 38:54.083
college catalogs, because we've taken in in the past, well, shortly before we moved, we took in a major deposit from the public and the University of California at Berkeley and pretty much completed

38:54.721 --> 38:56.103
the major colleges.

38:56.243 --> 38:58.005
I mean, come on, Phoenix Junior?

38:59.207 --> 39:07.457
I'm not passing judgment, but I'm not being a snob, but nevertheless, that's pretty arcane, isn't it?

39:07.477 --> 39:12.603
Yeah, and our stack maintenance management.

39:12.884 --> 39:16.508
You must have thousands of these things.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.710
Oh, yeah.

39:17.730 --> 39:22.956
Most of the labs are probably in some of the women's colleges that are now defunct.

39:23.476 --> 39:26.942
Well, Florida State College for Women.

39:26.982 --> 39:28.144
That may still exist.

39:28.424 --> 39:30.147
Who knows?

39:30.347 --> 39:32.631
The Casanovia Seminary?

39:32.831 --> 39:35.075
I don't know.

39:35.095 --> 39:38.701
And this is all empty space here, so this room here from what catalogs?

39:38.921 --> 39:41.485
Actually, this is from the catalog.

39:42.730 --> 39:44.212
Is it called some of the stuff?

39:44.232 --> 39:44.852
I bet there is.

39:44.993 --> 39:45.533
There is.

39:45.974 --> 39:55.425
And currently, since 1974, we've been getting it on a microfiche set, so we're no longer taking our hard copy for recent things.

39:55.445 --> 40:11.083
But we had someone from the University of Washington in Seattle who was doing research on women professors and the increase in women in academia.

40:11.755 --> 40:20.448
And so she came and was using college catalogs, and it's like every 10 years she was doing a check to see how the sponsorship was.

40:20.508 --> 40:22.030
That's good.

40:22.050 --> 40:22.411
That's good stuff.

40:22.431 --> 40:22.872
I like that.

40:22.892 --> 40:25.856
So she used her name, and she looked at materials.

40:26.036 --> 40:34.148
And normally we don't allow patrons into the staff, but for things like the college catalogs and our U.S.

40:34.228 --> 40:39.957
Inprint Texts book collection, we do make arrangements for them to come in.

40:40.578 --> 40:53.533
to kind of look at it, pick and choose which places she wanted, looking to see if she could get the four or five decades that she wanted to cover, to see if there was coverage for each one.

40:54.194 --> 40:59.139
Textbooks, again, not an uncataloged collection.

40:59.299 --> 41:09.471
A lot of people who are looking into subjects have been doing research and can recognize the time period based on the bindings.

41:09.907 --> 41:15.814
So it's much easier for them to come up and say, you know, I want to see English readers from the 1930s.

41:15.894 --> 41:29.751
They've seen the type of findings enough that they can come up and walk to the shelf of their last probably 30s and pick and choose, whereas a staff member would have to go through individually.

41:29.771 --> 41:31.533
And look at that.

41:32.154 --> 41:34.737
Another collection here is Foreign Official Gazette.

41:34.757 --> 41:36.319
Foreign Official Gazette.

41:36.772 --> 41:42.100
I'll be able to find these categories of myself in the... Definitely this one.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.085
The... Not necessarily, just to give me a range.

41:45.125 --> 41:50.653
You're looking for a nice paragraph of Arcania, you know?

41:50.713 --> 41:50.994
Okay.

41:52.376 --> 41:56.402
You know what I'm saying?

41:56.422 --> 41:56.622
Yes.

41:56.723 --> 41:58.345
So I can illustrate.

41:58.365 --> 41:58.606
Okay.

42:00.769 --> 42:00.889
And...

42:01.932 --> 42:07.663
I don't mean to suggest that I'm superficial, but I am sometimes.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.767
Burundi, look at that, huh?

42:09.787 --> 42:11.810
Cameroon's journal officiel.

42:11.830 --> 42:12.051
Wow.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.235
I'm not writing a book on the Center for Research Library.

42:14.255 --> 42:15.537
You're writing a book.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.623
Well, I'm bringing it in.

42:18.903 --> 42:20.206
Cypress cassette.

42:20.546 --> 42:22.310
This is our newsprint.

42:22.330 --> 42:25.155
We also have it on Michael Hill.

42:25.135 --> 42:27.238
We also have a microphone collection.

42:27.358 --> 42:32.645
You do not accept music as if the microphone exists anymore.

42:32.665 --> 42:40.275
And this is a collection of materials that we had from a variety of sources.

42:40.295 --> 42:49.928
And then New York Public just finished a deposit of most of their foreign official gazettes that they had.

42:49.948 --> 42:53.893
They did keep a few that they had fairly high use of.

42:55.223 --> 42:58.607
Do you have a reading room here where people can come and use it?

42:58.787 --> 42:59.608
Yes, we do.

43:00.189 --> 43:02.371
Service malls and it's by appointment only.

43:02.391 --> 43:06.536
And that's only so that we can have the materials paged and ready when they come.

43:07.257 --> 43:09.860
And if it happens to be checked out, we don't have to check.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.123
There's no reason to come when they don't make it check.

43:12.143 --> 43:12.583
What's that for?

43:12.623 --> 43:15.867
Oh, you told me that.

43:15.967 --> 43:16.307
Foreign.

43:16.387 --> 43:23.335
It's kind of the congressional record equivalent.

43:23.356 --> 43:24.657
London, is that it?

43:26.898 --> 43:31.763
So are you a librarian by training and temperament?

43:32.404 --> 43:33.305
Yes.

43:33.325 --> 43:36.107
I actually do collection development here at the Center.

43:36.127 --> 43:37.629
So we have a collection development.

43:38.730 --> 43:38.850
Yes.

43:38.870 --> 43:42.294
Do you have a vision policy?

43:42.314 --> 43:43.815
We have a policy.

43:43.835 --> 43:44.015
Do you?

43:44.076 --> 43:44.756
I'd love to see it.

43:44.856 --> 43:45.377
Can I have it?

43:45.477 --> 43:46.598
Sure.

43:47.219 --> 43:54.306
The collection development here is quite a lot different than other places because I do very little actual selection.

43:54.691 --> 43:56.934
Well, you come at it from a reverse angle.

43:57.034 --> 44:02.001
We come at it from a reverse angle so that... I should have brought my camera, darn it.

44:03.383 --> 44:05.065
So you've got some empty shelves here.

44:05.105 --> 44:10.953
Yeah, this is actually our foreign doctoral dissertation expansion space.

44:12.235 --> 44:20.586
We have currently 750,000 plus volumes of foreign doctoral dissertation.

44:20.626 --> 44:23.550
So Virginia is not a foreign country.

44:23.783 --> 44:39.525
You must have a lot of the ones that Chicago got in that Berliner acquisition, which was fantastic at the time, and that's 105 years or so ago, you know.

44:41.768 --> 44:47.416
And we also got a large deposit from the Whitewood Congress in terms of... These are all dissertations.

44:48.117 --> 44:49.679
All corn doctoral dissertations.

44:49.939 --> 44:51.441
Which have been printed, apparently.

44:51.501 --> 44:52.002
Printed.

44:52.420 --> 45:01.554
It's very common to print dissertations outside of the United States.

45:03.297 --> 45:05.700
Some of them are printed in series.

45:05.720 --> 45:09.326
Some of them are just printed.

45:09.346 --> 45:16.377
I believe there's some of these requirements.

45:16.597 --> 45:17.498
I mean, look at them.

45:17.518 --> 45:18.580
There are thousands of them.

45:19.353 --> 45:20.354
You said 750,000?

45:20.414 --> 45:21.055
Yeah, plus.

45:21.075 --> 45:23.138
And they're probably all here, right?

45:23.739 --> 45:24.640
You think?

45:24.660 --> 45:29.667
In between three arrangements of print, which is just size segments.

45:30.308 --> 45:35.435
So we have the shorter ones, the slightly taller ones that are roughly 8 by 11.

45:36.917 --> 45:40.502
And then the larger size print, microfiche and microfilm.

45:40.522 --> 45:41.744
Is this all searchable?

45:41.824 --> 45:44.207
I mean, is all this... Totally uncatalogued.

45:44.287 --> 45:45.309
Totally uncatalogued.

45:45.329 --> 45:45.449
Yes.

45:45.469 --> 45:46.070
So how do we know?

45:46.791 --> 45:47.672
We come and...

45:48.108 --> 45:53.055
Well, first of all, we tell our members to ask, and if we don't have it, we will attempt to obtain it.

45:54.276 --> 45:59.023
And we have someone who comes and looks on the shelf.

45:59.043 --> 46:04.210
We have things that we... Yeah, but they're stored by size, so where do you look?

46:04.230 --> 46:06.453
We go through the whole sequence.

46:06.553 --> 46:10.618
And a lot of the pages learn really quickly where things are likely to be.

46:11.079 --> 46:11.259
Okay.

46:11.279 --> 46:15.805
We have older German... So there is some categorization then.

46:15.946 --> 46:16.186
Yeah.

46:16.226 --> 46:16.326
Yeah.

46:16.964 --> 46:24.173
But it's all, it's not really... It's all kind of... It's ask a librarian, basically.

46:24.373 --> 46:25.214
Ask for help.

46:25.234 --> 46:33.104
Most of the older German materials, say pre-World War II, are in the shorter size and are going to be in the print sequence.

46:33.424 --> 46:46.060
The larger sizes tend to be either more modern or... I want to say they're more the French dissertations

46:46.613 --> 46:52.339
I know that there's one Swedish university that always publishes in that size.

46:52.359 --> 46:54.662
Well, there's some kind of classification.

46:57.004 --> 47:01.208
It's arranged by authors.

47:01.229 --> 47:02.290
So it is searchable.

47:02.310 --> 47:03.331
It is searchable, yes.

47:04.031 --> 47:11.119
I understand that you've got Walter Benjamin's thesis, which some guy offered you whatever for.

47:11.572 --> 47:14.355
But that must be, you could go look up Benjamin, right?

47:14.395 --> 47:16.337
Yeah, except that that one's now in our vault.

47:16.357 --> 47:17.698
As well it should be.

47:17.718 --> 47:18.659
That's a great story.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.203
And then there's speech and microphone.

47:22.563 --> 47:30.311
And, for example, the French dissertations that we get now are almost all in Fiche.

47:30.471 --> 47:34.315
So, you know, if you have a modern French dissertation, you go and look in Fiche first.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.840
You have a British dissertation.

47:40.445 --> 47:48.255
which, because of the copyright law, we have to order individually as requested if we don't already own it.

47:48.516 --> 47:49.938
Those are mostly on microfilm.

47:51.840 --> 48:01.793
So, you know, the pages in that area quickly learn the tricks of finding things quickly and reducing research time.

48:04.697 --> 48:05.999
Just looking at my watch.

48:06.039 --> 48:09.844
This is our...

48:10.448 --> 48:27.226
currently received serial selection.

48:27.246 --> 48:32.872
Courage being a loose term because you find a certain amount of space on the shelf and material on the shelf until the shelf is full or the tile of pieces.

48:32.892 --> 48:35.275
That means if you've got something that comes out annually, you could have 30 years of title sitting in current serial.

48:35.896 --> 48:42.852
Also, we don't normally bind our materials, though we do have things that have been bound.

48:43.854 --> 48:51.812
Most of these are materials that we receive from the Library of Congress in New Delhi, Islamabad.

48:52.957 --> 48:57.083
So LC is a very grateful member then, I gather?

48:57.403 --> 49:01.729
LC is not a member, but they have a... A special arrangement, probably.

49:01.749 --> 49:13.885
Well, they have something that's called the Quantity of Acquisitions Program, which is an extension of what was initially...

49:16.615 --> 49:19.098
the quote-unquote wheat funds.

49:19.118 --> 49:27.228
This is where in India, for example, we had sold grain.

49:27.248 --> 49:29.071
They had paid us in rupees.

49:30.152 --> 49:36.660
And what Congress did was enact a law that said, well, we're not going to take the rupees.

49:37.281 --> 49:45.612
We're going to buy books for the Congress Library and academic institutions in the United States instead.

49:45.632 --> 49:45.812
Mm-hmm.

49:46.231 --> 49:50.717
And then we were one of the early participants of that program.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.700
Need to come around this way so I can get some light.

49:53.881 --> 49:59.028
Where we are now is where the bulk of the print collection is stored.

50:01.191 --> 50:15.630
This was spread over... Monographic stuff and... And cereal intermixed, arranged by size, with Michelle Phillips.

50:19.289 --> 50:36.234
So, one thing we noticed is the changing publication pattern in the sense that monographs tend to be short, serials tend to be tall.

50:36.254 --> 50:46.208
So we have on the 1A, serials, which include not only in regular periodical magazines, but we also include in the largest size

50:46.525 --> 50:49.208
some of the tabloid-sized newspapers are here.

50:49.228 --> 51:01.404
So for example, the Moscow News is shelved here and not with the rest of the print newspaper collection.

51:02.045 --> 51:09.274
And as we move farther down and we get close, I will get into more books.

51:09.294 --> 51:14.541
The materials here range from things that

51:15.449 --> 51:28.850
The center subscribed to for a period things that members subscribed to and did not bind to things that they subscribed to and found and deposited with us.

51:28.870 --> 51:43.212
There is, because this is strictly an accession number, a title may appear in a variety of different locations throughout the sequences, and if it changes size, it moves

51:43.681 --> 51:45.704
the next things go to another location.

51:45.744 --> 51:55.360
So it's the most efficient use of shelving space for each home one.

51:55.380 --> 52:06.317
And so you can have all kinds of different things and different things.

52:06.337 --> 52:07.579
You know, there's no browsing facility because shelving

52:08.032 --> 52:14.421
I mean, we have to understand the function.

52:14.561 --> 52:16.624
This is not a blousable facility.

52:16.664 --> 52:18.146
This is not what you're meant to do.

52:18.246 --> 52:20.790
The browsing has been done.

52:20.870 --> 52:23.494
This stuff has been sent off to deep sleep, basically.

52:24.335 --> 52:24.575
Correct.

52:24.876 --> 52:26.898
Because I understand it's the title of the book.

52:26.979 --> 52:28.020
No, no, it's a chapter.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.482
The chapter is the book.

52:29.502 --> 52:29.923
Okay.

52:29.943 --> 52:31.485
No, no, that's just the chapter.

52:31.585 --> 52:35.050
I'm not so sure this is in that chapter, by the way, but it may be.

52:35.070 --> 52:37.313
I thought I'd use this in another chapter, but this is good.

52:37.883 --> 53:05.258
So having said that there's, you know, nothing neat in terms of how things are arranged, I'm stopped being here at what the staff called Nazi Books, which is a collection of material that were, I believe, at the University of Illinois, of materials that were published in Germany and occupied Europe during World War II.

53:05.542 --> 53:13.530
So you range from things like text by Hermann Goring to sometimes academic text.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.712
I think fantastic.

53:16.133 --> 53:17.735
That they allowed to be published.

53:18.255 --> 53:21.919
If I want to check and see if you have a title, I can't give it to you right now, but it's in German.

53:22.299 --> 53:22.419
Okay.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.523
But it was a last copy, and nobody could find it anywhere.

53:26.584 --> 53:31.909
It's my poster child story, and they were looking everywhere for this book.

53:31.929 --> 53:34.772
They couldn't find it, and I'm wondering if you'd have it.

53:34.972 --> 53:38.356
I can't give it to you off the top of my head.

53:38.696 --> 53:39.938
Give me your email address.

53:39.958 --> 53:47.246
I'll give you my business card and send it to me because I won't say that all of this has been completely recont.

53:48.507 --> 53:51.231
I'm hopeful that you don't have it.

53:51.271 --> 53:57.137
For my purposes, because the guy should have looked here.

53:58.359 --> 53:59.039
Maybe he should have.

53:59.060 --> 54:02.143
Actually, it'll work.

54:03.068 --> 54:05.431
So you have Goring stuff?

54:06.693 --> 54:07.874
Did Goebbels write anything?

54:07.975 --> 54:09.276
I mean, this is a pretty good collection.

54:09.296 --> 54:11.880
Look at the swastikas for crying out loud.

54:12.380 --> 54:14.303
What's the name of this book?

54:14.844 --> 54:24.316
So if I take this call number, will I be able to check it out?

54:25.318 --> 54:27.000
B186?

54:27.503 --> 54:31.008
B186 should take me to Goring.

54:31.028 --> 54:31.308
Yeah.

54:31.328 --> 54:33.331
So that could be a little test case for us, right?

54:33.351 --> 54:34.332
Yeah.

54:34.353 --> 54:36.075
You know, so... Look at the tape, Joe.

54:36.295 --> 54:40.040
It's got eagles and swastikas on the spine.

54:41.442 --> 54:43.806
And I wonder how that translates, though.

54:45.248 --> 54:46.710
Oh, my German's not that good.

54:46.750 --> 54:48.813
Now, look, look at what it is, see.

54:48.833 --> 54:49.193
Category 8.

54:49.594 --> 54:57.004
This was, when I was telling you about the Category 8 deposits, it came in under our crew's name, the Midwest River Center.

54:57.237 --> 55:07.314
And it was Category A, and this one happened to actually have been in the University of Chicago's library rather than the University of Illinois.

55:07.334 --> 55:09.037
Here he is, a Nazi.

55:09.057 --> 55:11.300
And was used three times.

55:12.302 --> 55:13.604
Well, that's pretty good.

55:13.845 --> 55:15.888
I hope you've gotten books run the first time.

55:15.928 --> 55:19.414
What were the dates on it?

55:20.018 --> 55:26.286
The dates of use ranged from December 5, 1950 to March 27, 1951.

55:26.306 --> 55:30.130
50, 51, and what was the last usage?

55:31.132 --> 55:32.313
According to this, March 27, 1951.

55:32.333 --> 55:35.357
So 50, 50, and 51?

55:35.717 --> 55:35.997
Right.

55:36.018 --> 55:37.339
50, 51, and 51.

55:37.359 --> 55:38.020
Yeah.

55:38.040 --> 55:45.469
My guess, given the range of dates, it was probably someone borrowed it and returned it and borrowed it again.

55:46.327 --> 55:48.290
But there you have it.

55:48.370 --> 55:48.830
There it is.

55:50.352 --> 55:50.913
Wow.

55:51.995 --> 55:59.965
This would be interesting in terms of the... Who is that?

56:00.306 --> 56:06.554
This is the Bhagavad Gita from Bari, Italy.

56:07.435 --> 56:09.938
During fascist years, right?

56:10.199 --> 56:12.722
Yeah, in 1943.

56:13.428 --> 56:16.072
So it came in during Mussolini's watch.

56:16.292 --> 56:16.753
Yeah.

56:18.095 --> 56:21.380
Oh, and actually it illustrates another thing, talking about condition.

56:21.720 --> 56:23.142
This is a paper-bound book.

56:23.162 --> 56:23.763
Fantastic.

56:23.783 --> 56:24.044
Look at this.

56:24.525 --> 56:25.105
Uncut.

56:27.389 --> 56:30.193
Safe to say usage has been low on this one.

56:30.674 --> 56:38.305
But it ranges from that type of material, from things actually published by the Nazis to things that, you know,

56:38.740 --> 56:39.982
You got the authorization.

56:40.002 --> 56:41.124
This is a whole thing here?

56:41.284 --> 56:42.806
There's some other things.

56:42.966 --> 56:44.769
Several hundred, several thousand?

56:44.909 --> 56:47.613
Actually, it's probably around three to five thousand.

56:48.655 --> 57:03.136
And there are a couple things in other sizes, but the B's happen to be the... Is B significant of anything, or is that just a... No, B just means, roughly speaking, it's, what, eight inches tall?

57:04.658 --> 57:05.760
Eight to nine inches tall.

57:06.027 --> 57:18.166
And it just so happened that this material came in at the same time, and that's why it ended up together as a collection.

57:19.668 --> 57:23.253
You know, which makes it nice for... That's fascinating.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.256
...shilling off.

57:25.276 --> 57:32.187
And then the last thing I'll show you was kind of the variety of things that when they were initially depositing material,

57:33.027 --> 57:36.912
The work of Wall Street, for instance.

57:36.972 --> 57:38.974
Now, these aren't subjects at all.

57:39.194 --> 57:39.615
At all.

57:40.076 --> 57:56.115
So you can have a lot of kind of business text next to, say, industrial, technical text, next to theology, next to

57:56.467 --> 57:58.930
And I'm assuming there's some kind of history check.

57:58.950 --> 58:03.136
Well, as Ron Lane told me in HD, we eliminate the air.

58:03.377 --> 58:04.719
That's what they have in common.

58:04.779 --> 58:05.319
Yes.

58:05.339 --> 58:07.362
Is that all the news that fits, we print.

58:07.382 --> 58:14.773
You know, kind of like if it fits, you're eliminating as much air as you can as possible from up here.

58:15.774 --> 58:19.820
And so, you know, it just... What happens to the chillness?

58:19.980 --> 58:20.681
How about fiction?

58:20.741 --> 58:21.943
Is there a fiction element here?

58:22.083 --> 58:24.246
There are some...

58:25.745 --> 58:27.568
books of fiction, but not a lot.

58:28.329 --> 58:31.794
I would tend to think that you really discouraged fiction.

58:31.814 --> 58:41.408
We do now, but when the initial storage facility aspect came in, they went ahead and they would go ahead and do this.

58:41.468 --> 58:45.053
This is fundamentally a research decision.

58:45.657 --> 58:52.148
So, you know, our members are not going to have had lots of fiction except in their English literature courses.

58:52.248 --> 58:54.872
And that might go out off-site.

58:54.892 --> 58:55.413
Yes.

58:55.954 --> 59:03.987
Now, while we officially don't want to collect rare books, some of our members set things to us.

59:04.008 --> 59:05.770
That's going to be old.

59:05.831 --> 59:06.852
Is this an incunable?

59:08.415 --> 59:10.939
I'm sitting here going with my...

59:11.037 --> 59:16.742
This is one of those nice Latin things that's not done the common way.

59:16.762 --> 59:16.983
L-X-X.

59:17.983 --> 59:21.507
Yeah, but see, they have these CI funky things.

59:23.769 --> 59:26.391
Well, it certainly is an old book.

59:26.411 --> 59:29.274
I think this is in the 1700s.

59:29.354 --> 59:32.517
But it's vellum binding with a ball toad.

59:32.537 --> 59:37.922
So it's an 18th century book in vellum.

59:40.096 --> 59:41.077
Melissa Park.

59:41.098 --> 59:46.045
There's that one line that came from Chicago.

59:46.165 --> 59:46.626
Yeah.

59:48.108 --> 59:52.014
And see, this is probably part of the Berlin collection.

59:53.456 --> 59:55.018
Well, I would think so.

59:55.699 --> 59:56.360
Well, I would think so.

59:56.401 --> 59:57.823
That would make sense, wouldn't it?

01:00:04.212 --> 01:00:04.332
Yeah.

01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:05.214
Okay, great.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:05.735
This is excellent.

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.360
So we'll take a quick trip downstairs and visit our

01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:10.698
on my catalog.

01:00:10.778 --> 01:00:12.120
We need some handouts.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.222
Yeah, maybe we can call me a cab while we're doing that.

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:16.524
It's probably going to take 15 minutes or so to get one, right?

01:00:17.585 --> 01:00:21.128
I hate to be rushing, but I'm... You're leaving.

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:26.954
I'm anxious about the... I'm going to go back to the hotel, check out, and get out to... Oh, here.

01:00:26.974 --> 01:00:29.276
Thanks.

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:30.578
This is great.

01:00:31.358 --> 01:00:31.799
Thank you.

01:00:31.819 --> 01:00:38.065
And so, I meant it was kind of going, where's the copy of the B?

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:48.415
and how long have you been with the Center?

01:00:48.915 --> 01:00:55.303
I started working at the Center in 1979 at the Page while going to library school.

01:00:55.363 --> 01:00:56.284
Out here, obviously.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:57.325
At Chicago.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:02.772
I did graduate from one place, but I have yet to graduate from the other.

01:01:02.852 --> 01:01:03.953
What a pity that school.

01:01:04.914 --> 01:01:05.155
Yeah.

01:01:05.175 --> 01:01:08.018
I'm going to shut this glass now.
