WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.355
There's so many things out there.

00:03.395 --> 00:06.158
You know, right now, in my opinion, it's a trade issue.

00:06.980 --> 00:08.682
We just can't go the way we're going.

00:09.563 --> 00:10.985
You know, we're the patsy for the world.

00:11.005 --> 00:12.867
We're the last of the free traders out there.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.309
I believe in the Gifford bill.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.713
Boston Grove editorialized against it.

00:16.753 --> 00:17.754
Maybe your paper did.

00:18.155 --> 00:18.695
I don't know.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.699
But I think we have to do something about it.

00:21.719 --> 00:28.869
You know, when the time comes that in the EEC, the European Economic Council, what is the economy of Florida?

00:28.909 --> 00:31.152
The economy of Florida is tourist and citrus.

00:31.773 --> 00:37.699
And you can't ship a lemon or an orange or a grapefruit to all of Europe?

00:38.160 --> 00:43.786
Well, that's protectionism, because they grow their own now in Spain and Portugal.

00:43.806 --> 00:48.311
England has stanchions— So you're going to buy a lemon over there and it'll cost you four dollars.

00:48.351 --> 00:51.854
England had a contract for a billion and a half dollars in stanchions.

00:51.894 --> 00:53.977
Wouldn't let the United States bid on it.

00:54.377 --> 00:55.899
Maybe we couldn't have been the low bidder.

00:56.559 --> 00:58.962
And they talk of us, but we're looking for protection.

00:59.785 --> 01:02.247
We've been a patchy for the world.

01:02.347 --> 01:03.449
Unbelievable, the thing.

01:03.469 --> 01:06.792
Talk about—let me just talk about one of the normal things.

01:07.573 --> 01:14.359
Ninety-five percent of the baseball glove is made in America, not a national sport, and every kid has a baseball glove.

01:14.379 --> 01:15.400
It's made in Japan.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.602
Where the balls come from.

01:17.822 --> 01:21.986
Well, the balls are an American contract that is being counted out in Haiti.

01:22.467 --> 01:28.813
But the interesting thing about the bats, they don't allow—the Louisville bat is the only thing that's made in this country.

01:29.165 --> 01:31.748
of the sport of baseball.

01:31.788 --> 01:33.510
They don't allow them in Japan.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.333
They use aluminum bats over there.

01:36.353 --> 01:42.660
You know, you can get down there, you know, they subsidize goods and sell them here, they dump here.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.746
We're just going to have another $170 billion deficit.

01:47.966 --> 01:51.110
That corresponds to about four million jobs.

01:51.130 --> 01:56.556
The economy is good, but the economy isn't going to be good because we've been living on consumer.

01:56.992 --> 02:09.150
So there are obviously some loose ends that you would have liked to have tied up before you went.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.693
Oh, I wouldn't.

02:12.134 --> 02:14.417
People say to me, hey, do you miss it?

02:14.437 --> 02:15.639
Oh, I miss it every day.

02:15.679 --> 02:16.881
I had my staff around.

02:16.901 --> 02:17.923
I had my briefings.

02:17.943 --> 02:18.463
I went there.

02:19.224 --> 02:24.993
Everything was going from the State Department of Foreign Affairs, Domestic Affairs.

02:25.093 --> 02:25.834
I was briefed.

02:26.270 --> 02:28.373
a week or whenever I was invited there.

02:28.393 --> 02:34.041
I always called the State, what I could call the Secretary of State, Department of Defense, Weinberger, Schultz.

02:34.061 --> 02:36.605
I'd like to go over the office to briefing.

02:36.625 --> 02:39.449
And I had a very excellent, capable young staff.

02:40.310 --> 02:47.700
And I was the one that made decisions, and I was at my own caucus and my own policy committee and my own whip organization.

02:48.902 --> 02:54.229
It's hard just to walk away from the scene after 50 years, but things are going pretty good.

02:54.269 --> 02:54.690
You miss it.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.501
You know the interesting thing, my Millie is a terrific person.

03:01.403 --> 03:08.430
I retired and we have a condo down in Sumner, right out in about seven miles from the White House, in Maryland.

03:08.450 --> 03:17.419
And I would get up in the morning, pick up a post at the door, put up my brass rope and have a cup of coffee, sit around the house, you know.

03:17.439 --> 03:19.882
She said, listen, where's the papers?

03:19.902 --> 03:25.167
I can't say, take a shower, shave, get dressed again, get the paper, I'll have breakfast when you come back.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.333
He said, get yourself an office downtown.

03:28.853 --> 03:30.335
I'm not going to make lunch for you.

03:30.415 --> 03:32.137
I never made lunch for you in 46 years.

03:32.218 --> 03:33.519
I'm not going to start now.

03:33.539 --> 03:34.561
You'll become an old man.

03:34.641 --> 03:35.662
I want you to get out there.

03:36.523 --> 03:40.528
Go out and make speeches and talk to students and get out there and get yourself free.

03:40.748 --> 03:43.312
You can keep yourself a lift, which I've been doing.

03:43.752 --> 03:47.076
So maybe it begs the question, why did you retire?

03:47.617 --> 03:48.578
You're still a viper.

03:48.598 --> 03:53.905
Well, one of the reasons I retired is when Millie and I were sitting around one night, you know, you're speaking right here.

03:54.931 --> 03:59.455
She said, you know, you always had a vision for the job yourself.

03:59.475 --> 04:01.797
Oh, Sam Rayman was Speaker for 16 years.

04:02.818 --> 04:07.082
McComick was Majority Leader for 16 years and Speaker for nine years.

04:07.743 --> 04:11.026
He used to say, when are those people going to give a young fellow a chance?

04:11.946 --> 04:17.131
You know, you've been whipped for two years, Majority Leader for four, Speaker for 16 years.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.854
You were Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.096
When are you going to get out and give a young fellow a chance?

04:22.856 --> 04:23.537
Okay, honey.

04:24.007 --> 04:27.510
I'll announce tomorrow one more term and we're through.

04:28.411 --> 04:30.393
And it gave you a nice, neat 50 years.

04:31.053 --> 04:35.037
No, it gave me 50 years, but not only that, I got on my own terms.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.479
I was still stronger than my party.

04:37.519 --> 04:39.421
My image was higher than I'd ever been.

04:39.501 --> 04:42.744
I wouldn't have had any problems getting elected in my history.

04:43.124 --> 04:45.426
I could have been re-elected as Speaker.

04:45.446 --> 04:47.809
But I took the right time.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.471
Like Ted Williams go out as a champ, right?

04:51.292 --> 04:53.794
Never forget that October.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.063
ball that he ever hit right over the fence.

04:56.263 --> 04:56.984
That's the way to go.

04:57.004 --> 04:57.684
Go out a winner.

04:57.904 --> 04:58.585
Go out a winner.

04:59.106 --> 05:05.091
I have one more question to ask you, and I know I don't want to overstay my welcome.

05:05.351 --> 05:06.112
I've read two books.

05:06.312 --> 05:07.073
Maybe I'll put it here.

05:07.513 --> 05:12.418
My fellow who's reviewing this book for me, his name is Dick Hapey, and he just watched it.

05:12.878 --> 05:15.160
He heard an anecdote, and he doesn't think it's in the book.

05:15.500 --> 05:15.781
Yeah.

05:16.221 --> 05:22.267
And it's about how you and Don Regan are both from Cambridge, and you ran into him one day and said, your cousin Agnes.

05:23.127 --> 05:23.848
Oh, that's in the book.

05:24.132 --> 05:24.893
That's in the book?

05:24.953 --> 05:25.954
He said he couldn't find it.

05:26.014 --> 05:27.977
Well, yeah, that's in the book.

05:28.097 --> 05:32.863
I say in the book, every time I'd see Don Reagan, I'd always say, hey, your cousin's from home.

05:33.023 --> 05:33.964
How about so-and-so?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.506
Yeah, he probably hasn't finished the book.

05:35.526 --> 05:36.447
Yeah, it's in there somewhere.

05:36.487 --> 05:37.689
I'm pretty sure it is.

05:37.729 --> 05:38.670
We'll leave it there.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.433
But that anecdote is straight, right?

05:41.673 --> 05:42.414
Cousin Rose.

05:43.656 --> 05:48.161
As a matter of fact, the funny thing, who do you think came into the coop yesterday?

05:48.902 --> 05:52.907
I signed a book for Cousin Rose yesterday in the Harvard coop.

05:53.309 --> 05:58.437
And she says to me, Tip, we're proud of my cousin, Don.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.902
But she says, we're still Tip O'Neill Democrats.

06:02.042 --> 06:02.964
Two fast questions.

06:03.004 --> 06:07.210
The president you've known personally who you respect the most, Harry Truman, I think.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.093
Well, I love Jack Kennedy, of course.

06:09.113 --> 06:10.115
You know what I mean?

06:10.135 --> 06:13.400
He had a thousand days, and it's hard to assess a record.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.142
But he did so much for the world.

06:15.183 --> 06:19.229
Respect in terms of political accomplishments.

06:19.850 --> 06:21.392
His greatest things, of course, was

06:21.997 --> 06:26.944
the Cuban crisis, get your missiles out of there, number one.

06:26.964 --> 06:29.088
And two was the Berlin Waller.

06:29.108 --> 06:35.858
But he was so handsome and so articulate, he drew people all around the world into new governments.

06:35.878 --> 06:36.919
He did a fantastic job.

06:36.939 --> 06:48.156
But when you look at the record, how Harry was demeaned by old Harry Truman, how he was hated in America, how he couldn't have won for re-election, so people thought, but they thought, oh, Vladimir 48,

06:48.507 --> 06:51.791
But the record was that he saved Greece from communism.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.935
He saved Italy from communism, responsible for the march of France.

06:55.696 --> 06:56.897
The buck stops here.

06:56.937 --> 06:58.699
He determined what you were going to do.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.406
He dropped the atom bomb, saved 10 million American lives and allied lives, and stopped the war.

07:04.787 --> 07:06.068
He moved into Korea.

07:06.228 --> 07:07.590
He had guts.

07:07.610 --> 07:13.517
You know, he's probably the last of the fellows, the last person we ever had who wasn't a college graduate.

07:13.537 --> 07:18.463
But he had the insight, and he had the guts, and he had the streetcar knowledge, and he had the savages.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.844
And boy, he did what was absolutely right.

07:22.865 --> 07:24.768
And he grows and grows and grows.

07:24.808 --> 07:26.310
And you look at our economy.

07:26.330 --> 07:29.214
We're having problems right there now with trade.

07:29.235 --> 07:35.904
For 50 years, you know, when the war was over, we were the only nation of the world that was unscathed.

07:36.805 --> 07:38.908
Our industrial complex was still moving.

07:39.028 --> 07:41.171
Our agricultural plants, we fed the world.

07:41.612 --> 07:43.355
We traded with everybody.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.818
We lived off the rest of the world while we developed it.

07:46.152 --> 07:50.036
We lived off the rest of the world, and all of that was Harry's ideas and thoughts.

07:51.177 --> 08:00.686
The brainy people who came to him, the buck stops here, I make the decision, I don't delegate the decision to anybody, I make the decision, this is what we're going to do.

08:01.687 --> 08:04.070
And he looks greater and greater and greater in history.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.331
And one last question.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.115
How do I put it?

08:09.155 --> 08:13.599
You have been a witness to 25% of our history.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.501
I know, I know the license government.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.308
That's kind of a rare privilege, isn't it?

08:18.328 --> 08:18.809
It really is.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.231
And I just wondered if you could give me a brief introduction.

08:21.251 --> 08:27.337
You know, the interesting thing, I met Coolidge, when Coolidge was governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

08:27.357 --> 08:30.720
I met him in the Quincy House on my ninth birthday.

08:30.740 --> 08:35.305
And I never did meet Harding.

08:35.325 --> 08:38.287
And I met Hoover, I don't know how many times.

08:38.308 --> 08:41.671
And from then on, I've known every president.

08:41.731 --> 08:44.053
I know Roosevelt.

08:44.523 --> 08:51.029
That's a great story.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.711
She took you in the White House.

08:54.572 --> 09:01.458
And so I've known every one of them all the way along the line, and it's quite a part of history that I've played.

09:02.399 --> 09:14.310
When I try to write the book, you know, Jerry Ford wrote a book, Kissinger wrote a book, Carter wrote a book, Nixon wrote a book.

09:14.763 --> 09:28.356
And I said, hey, I'm going to write a book.

09:28.376 --> 09:37.946
And I'm not going to give the details of how legislation was passed or what was in a bill or things like that.

09:38.547 --> 09:44.112
I'm going to give them a general complex of how America was when I was a kid and I get into public life.

09:44.716 --> 09:59.212
what the ethics of politics was, what America was like, how the changes have come, how you accomplish things in the back room, and how great the government has been, because it responds to the people.

09:59.252 --> 10:01.535
The government is not the enemy of the people.

10:01.575 --> 10:03.417
The Congress is not the enemy of the people.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.420
Under a democracy, democracy works.

10:07.241 --> 10:14.689
The government responds to people, and that's why we have such a tremendous... And also, you made it very readable by throwing in some great stories.

10:15.395 --> 10:18.141
That's pretty important, too, I think.

10:18.161 --> 10:19.110
All right.
