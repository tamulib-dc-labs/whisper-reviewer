00:01.752 --> 00:04.360
So if you could just say your name for .

00:04.520 --> 00:08.030
Okay.

00:13.506 --> 00:14.108
Great.

00:16.906 --> 00:28.987
And you were saying that this library was a model for... On Bibliotech Saint-Generes in Paris.

00:29.608 --> 00:30.851
By La Broste.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.936
Bibliotech Saint-Generes in Paris.

00:33.916 --> 01:01.307
object return and this house here and the idea here in the building concept is the forged iron you know and that was used then in the tower and so on in all the railway station that age and in the orange leaves etc i mean and this house is the first in sweden to be built with the forged iron as a

01:01.642 --> 01:25.598
By the way, I have already visited the new French library and the new British library and just two days ago the new German library.

01:25.618 --> 01:28.122
It's a very good succession.

01:28.102 --> 01:38.403
And then I also went to Leipzig to see what they're doing with the preservation, you see.

01:38.684 --> 01:40.728
I haven't been to Leipzig after the port.

01:40.808 --> 01:42.031
I've been there before.

01:42.592 --> 01:46.019
At least 10 or 15 years ago I've been there.

01:46.079 --> 01:48.304
Not after the port of India.

01:48.841 --> 01:59.198
Do you think it was a good idea to, because this building was designed according to 19th century sensibilities and needs.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.762
You mean this one here?

02:01.782 --> 02:02.102
Yes.

02:03.765 --> 02:08.032
Was it more difficult with your restoration to bring it into the 21st century?

02:08.332 --> 02:10.516
Would it have been better to maybe just build a new building?

02:10.656 --> 02:15.203
But as an author who died in practice, nothing exists only for building.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.448
taken except the facade, the big reading room and the entrance hall.

02:21.528 --> 02:25.093
Everything has been opened.

02:25.113 --> 02:26.134
Everything has been opened.

02:26.154 --> 02:34.485
I mean, you can't see it from outside, but from the inside you can see it.

02:34.505 --> 02:39.412
And this was inaugurated by the King of King on the 2nd of June this year.

02:39.532 --> 02:41.314
It was inaugurated.

02:41.815 --> 02:44.278
Let's say it was inaugurated in 2nd of June.

02:45.254 --> 02:50.962
And the building has been totally transformed, but totally transformed.

02:51.443 --> 03:01.878
And the big feature here is that we have placed the stacks under the earth level, deep under the earth level here.

03:01.918 --> 03:12.814
The books that only were above us are now done, and above us are new of the premise, new of the premise.

03:12.946 --> 03:18.161
So that people are sitting in daylight and books are sitting in the dark.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.646
You can see my point.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.772
It's quite opposite from what the French have done.

03:21.932 --> 03:22.574
Exactly.

03:23.096 --> 03:23.838
Exactly.

03:24.159 --> 03:25.302
But exactly.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.256
We have pointed out to them also, Mr. Belarad.

03:28.677 --> 03:44.353
Mr. Belarad, who is the head of the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, General de France, he was here in our inauguration, I just made that point to him, that you are building thousands of books, and then you place the, uh, straw under, you know,

03:44.333 --> 03:45.795
Either way around.

03:45.815 --> 03:48.560
And of course, they make the towers of glass now.

03:49.161 --> 03:51.905
And so now they have to protect the books with wood.

03:52.145 --> 03:55.851
And the readers are down here and the books are up here.

03:55.871 --> 04:01.380
And this wood that they bought would take in books with.

04:01.698 --> 04:06.224
It's wood that, if I write in form, wood has been taken from the Amazonas.

04:06.324 --> 04:13.012
I mean, you know, this type of wood that shouldn't be taken back home.

04:13.573 --> 04:19.440
And all the, you have, you know how to enter the library and how exactly.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.065
My bad back, I've been killing myself today.

04:23.465 --> 04:28.271
And then you arrive on the roof of the terrace.

04:28.732 --> 04:29.933
The terrace is...

04:30.554 --> 04:39.284
is made of the same Amazonas wood again from the general.

04:39.324 --> 04:44.210
The enormous, what is the name of that?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.073
The plank, yeah.

04:46.673 --> 04:51.058
Enormous, the word plank, gold, that would be so much here.

04:51.079 --> 04:55.904
It's a level ground and it consists of this Amazonas wood.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.869
See, they didn't tell me that when I was there.

05:00.862 --> 05:03.717
and I think this building is

05:04.085 --> 05:05.968
I've seen it very carefully.

05:05.988 --> 05:10.033
I mean that when it was under construction, I've seen it when it's half-ready.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.235
It's still only half-ready.

05:11.255 --> 05:19.165
You know, they haven't opened the search levels, the only public library level in the upper portals.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.730
First, I guess what they wanted to do was create a statement.

05:23.271 --> 05:25.073
No, no, no.

05:25.093 --> 05:26.114
A very expensive one.

05:26.355 --> 05:27.536
A very expensive one.

05:27.576 --> 05:31.482
Well, of course, statements are very interesting, but what does it do for books?

05:31.622 --> 05:32.623
No.

05:32.603 --> 05:42.514
And I don't want to be too critical of them because, you know, it's wonderful that they are interested in their books and in their library.

05:42.855 --> 05:50.543
And the French have reason to be, of course, I mean, you know, French, French, what would they be then without that?

05:50.643 --> 05:52.325
So in that sense, it's all right.

05:52.646 --> 06:00.855
And it's also right in the sense that they have put the library in the Eastern period that needs something to be...

06:01.949 --> 06:03.594
And it's supportive.

06:03.614 --> 06:10.474
You have the new French opera, the Bastille opera, and you have the new

06:11.416 --> 06:15.702
But I don't think it's such a good idea to be so close to the river.

06:15.983 --> 06:17.845
No, of course not.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.408
Now they can't go below.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.613
They couldn't go below even if they wanted to.

06:23.073 --> 06:25.317
Because they're right next to the river.

06:25.477 --> 06:27.800
Paris is standing on sand.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.405
You know that Montmartre is a heap of sand.

06:31.426 --> 06:32.267
I didn't know that.

06:32.507 --> 06:36.713
They had enormous difficulties when they constructed at least a suffrage.

06:36.974 --> 06:40.579
Because they couldn't bring it to stand still.

06:40.559 --> 06:43.593
is just a heap of sand in my mouth.

06:44.798 --> 06:47.451
Tell me if I can just totally switch gears now.

06:48.716 --> 06:49.962
Tell me about

06:50.195 --> 06:55.662
What is the purpose of the national library in Sweden?

06:55.702 --> 07:05.916
The purpose is in all other countries to preserve at least one copy of everything that has been printed in the country for generations to come.

07:06.196 --> 07:08.780
To function as the memory of the nation.

07:09.060 --> 07:16.270
We are the memory of the nation.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.519
on the side of the National Archives as well.

07:19.559 --> 07:28.975
I mean, the National Archives collect documents from the Swedish government, et cetera, from official documents from the Swedish government.

07:29.035 --> 07:36.047
We collect the printed heritage of Swedes, printed in Sweden.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.764
A print is, that's a critical word, it's a print.

07:39.985 --> 07:40.685
Nowadays it is.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.408
It wasn't 20 years ago.

07:42.428 --> 07:48.876
Nowadays it becomes very critical with the virtual reality that we have around us and we have to cope with that as well.

07:49.076 --> 07:53.862
But if you look back, historically you can see what I mean on that.

07:53.882 --> 07:59.569
Everything print should be preserved in at least one optical future generation.

07:59.749 --> 08:01.371
And going back as far as you can go?

08:01.451 --> 08:05.376
Oh yes, until 1487 when the first

08:05.963 --> 08:07.265
was printed in Sweden.

08:07.285 --> 08:19.346
I mean, you know, Gutenberg was working in Mainz in Germany about 1450 and the Gutenberg Bible is from 1454 or something like that.

08:19.366 --> 08:24.816
And the first book to be printed in Sweden was in 1480.

08:25.184 --> 08:31.394
And what is the first book?

08:31.874 --> 08:38.324
My name is Latin.

08:38.745 --> 08:48.019
It is a paper, a Latin paper book about how the animals do and how the...

08:47.999 --> 08:49.524
It's more for people.

08:49.604 --> 08:51.952
I like these children's fairy tales.

08:52.052 --> 08:55.905
How does the wood do and how does the... So it's okay.

08:55.925 --> 08:57.068
And you have a copy of it?

08:57.089 --> 08:57.570
Yes, of course.

08:57.820 --> 09:18.478
and is that basically to you what the gutenberg bible is saying so yeah that's not that important but if you read that work in the library really know about it and if you if you're also going to 3d why would you then decide to to print just this work as the first work you know you should decide for something very important

09:18.458 --> 09:32.940
The point is, they didn't realize they were doing anything historic.

09:34.220 --> 09:56.110
and it's also interesting that it's been written when you look at most of the incunables they're really not very interesting books i mean they happen to be old but whether or not they're important literary objects a lot of the incunabular is trash when you think of it i don't mean to use that word and they try to make it

09:56.090 --> 09:57.751
be similar to manuscripts.

09:57.892 --> 10:00.574
I mean, the first thing can have a new plot.

10:00.594 --> 10:12.705
That was exactly the point, which is why they had the space for decorations and the rubrications and the illuminated letters and the two colors, and Gutenberg, you know, gave up on the rubrications after the point.

10:13.346 --> 10:18.770
How about, but I said when you stress print, but how about the collection of manuscripts?

10:18.790 --> 10:26.097
We have also a collection of manuscripts relating to well-known Swedish men and women, of course.

10:26.077 --> 10:28.080
especially related to Stockholms.

10:28.300 --> 10:38.636
We have, for instance, the biggest collection of manuscripts over August, by August, Strindberg, in Batesville, and we have Stenman, if you know about her, as well.

10:38.976 --> 10:40.539
And Selma from Strindberg?

10:40.699 --> 10:42.842
Lagerlof, Lagerlof.

10:44.585 --> 10:47.569
She is the guy, Kate over Strindberg, that is right.

10:47.589 --> 10:49.272
Well, I know Strindberg.

10:49.292 --> 10:53.518
I want to ask you a question about Strindberg, because I was just over at the Swedish Academy.

10:53.600 --> 11:04.294
And you can't pass up the opportunity to ask, you know, about Strenberg not winning the Nobel or Tolstoy or Kazantzakis or Graham Greene.

11:04.555 --> 11:06.598
They have been impressed with everyone.

11:06.678 --> 11:09.541
They made some hits.

11:09.642 --> 11:12.265
Thomas Mann, you see the Nobel Prize.

11:12.285 --> 11:13.667
But if you look at the list,

11:14.002 --> 11:15.945
It's frightening.

11:15.965 --> 11:16.766
It's frightening.

11:16.786 --> 11:18.308
It's really frightening.

11:18.488 --> 11:24.857
And I should say, I mean, is from a political point impossible.

11:24.877 --> 11:26.980
It is impossible.

11:27.000 --> 11:39.997
How should these 18, now there's 40 men and women be able to have the time and to judge about so many arguments in his work.

11:40.017 --> 11:40.718
I mean, it's...

11:40.883 --> 11:45.790
And because another thing I question them about is they read it in translation.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.832
No?

11:46.952 --> 11:47.132
No.

11:47.512 --> 11:49.355
Yes and no.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.377
It depends.

11:50.437 --> 11:52.239
It depends what language they are in.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.822
What if it's a lousy translation?

11:55.784 --> 11:59.930
Shakespeare was lucky that he had a good Russian translator in Pasternak.

11:59.950 --> 12:03.696
Pasternak was a bit different.

12:03.716 --> 12:05.338
In my opinion, Pasternak was a bit different.

12:05.622 --> 12:06.625
I like him.

12:06.645 --> 12:08.611
And I think man was a hit.

12:08.631 --> 12:12.462
Sartre, of course, although he denied to receive it.

12:12.542 --> 12:13.044
Who else?

12:13.585 --> 12:14.588
Sartre and Hitson?

12:15.090 --> 12:19.362
Yeah, on the border.

12:19.612 --> 12:21.635
Thomas Mann in any case.

12:21.655 --> 12:23.017
Thomas Mann in any case.

12:23.518 --> 12:25.261
And Rida, I should say, yes.

12:25.301 --> 12:27.985
And Herman Hester, that was very good of them.

12:28.025 --> 12:32.972
They decided to give the Nobel Prize to Herman Hester in 47 or 48, I know.

12:33.914 --> 12:36.878
But they certainly missed on Borges.

12:36.858 --> 12:40.963
He should have had it, of course.

12:40.983 --> 12:44.808
I mean, all these Russians didn't get it at that time.

12:45.509 --> 12:56.383
I tried to tell Nicholas here about the string, but that he got something like an alternative price from the stock of citizens.

12:56.403 --> 12:57.524
Wasn't that the case?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.887
I am not aware of that.

13:00.308 --> 13:03.051
He died in 19...

13:03.605 --> 13:11.934
But I didn't realize until this morning that he also was a librarian.

13:12.134 --> 13:14.697
Yes, he was working in this library.

13:14.717 --> 13:27.732
When the library moved from the Royal Palace, where you have been today in the morning, the Royal Library was housed in the Bernadotte Library, where you have been today, in these beautiful premises you have seen today, in the morning, didn't you?

13:27.752 --> 13:31.536
We were housed until December 1877.

13:31.516 --> 13:51.212
when they moved here in the autumn of 1877 they moved from the royal palace up here to the park and Strindberg was active in exactly when moving he spent a few years in the palace and a few years here so i think he worked about four years and two or two of them in the palace

13:51.192 --> 13:55.637
And when the library moved, would you say it became a more professional organization?

13:55.757 --> 13:56.298
Yes, yes, yes.

13:56.318 --> 14:00.002
What was the distinction when it was part of the Royal Palace?

14:00.022 --> 14:00.944
None.

14:00.964 --> 14:16.542
I mean, of course, it was a very modern house when we had moved here, 120 years, you know, and that was a new start, and they kicked for an order, of course, to have a new, modern, clean house, where the new

14:16.522 --> 14:19.185
They died from cold, etc.

14:19.525 --> 14:26.091
They didn't have heating in the palace, and it was so cramped.

14:26.111 --> 14:37.823
I mean, it must have been an enormous experience for those people who weren't alive at that time to go from your palace here, and then you're going to hit the bottom.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.946
There are many memories I'm going to be having about it.

14:41.026 --> 14:45.330
And what is the size of your collection, Steve?

14:45.631 --> 14:50.038
Nowadays we have just under 3 million boxes.

14:50.058 --> 14:51.801
So it's compact.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.163
It's the second language.

14:53.223 --> 14:59.774
The biggest would be Carolina or so on.

14:59.794 --> 15:02.919
But we are the second biggest language.

15:03.941 --> 15:06.785
Do you do anything with digitization?

15:06.925 --> 15:08.428
Always, yes.

15:09.209 --> 15:09.850
Always, yes.

15:10.724 --> 15:14.188
We have so many photos underway here.

15:14.789 --> 15:26.041
The entire thing of posters that are very bad things and very important to save for future generations of consoles.

15:26.422 --> 15:30.126
We have started with wind.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.088
You know what I mean with posters?

15:32.108 --> 15:35.212
Yes, I understand.

15:35.232 --> 15:36.153
Are you scanning them?

15:36.954 --> 15:38.976
We are scanning them.

15:39.260 --> 15:40.202
But they don't?

15:40.222 --> 15:40.883
Scan them.

15:40.903 --> 15:42.185
Scan them, yes.

15:42.205 --> 15:42.646
Okay.

15:42.666 --> 15:45.070
And then you're keeping the originals, right?

15:45.090 --> 15:49.357
They are still keeping them together, yes.

15:49.697 --> 15:54.706
And we are microfilming this whole bunch of Swedish daily newspapers.

15:54.726 --> 15:55.307
Microfilming.

15:55.748 --> 16:00.375
And we are planning in the future to scan parts of it.

16:00.395 --> 16:04.963
But we are microfilming because the paper quality of the ending

16:05.180 --> 16:11.589
19th century is so bad that even if you don't touch them, they fall apart.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.004
Now, in the language of Congress in Washington,

16:15.322 --> 16:19.548
They also microfilm newspapers, and then when they do that, they discard the newspapers.

16:19.609 --> 16:21.872
Do you do the same thing?

16:22.453 --> 16:30.685
No, we can keep them in a store outside the city.

16:31.246 --> 16:35.693
And so, what is the philosophy there to keep them?

16:36.334 --> 16:40.300
I wouldn't say emotional, but

16:42.187 --> 16:48.936
Even if you make a very elegant microfilm, it's not the same as the origin, if you see the origin.

16:48.956 --> 16:56.946
And if we are able to keep the origins before the common iteration contract to it, I'm not sure if it would be possible.

16:57.027 --> 17:01.933
So the whole concept of deaccessioning materials is not in the vocabulary.

17:02.048 --> 17:06.232
No, you mean what they're doing like this?

17:06.772 --> 17:09.235
No, we never tried that.

17:09.255 --> 17:18.343
The mask, the acidification, and I'm not the expert to be asked about these questions, but we have decided not to act as they do.

17:18.703 --> 17:25.029
We prefer them to make the documents virtualised instead of the act.

17:27.231 --> 17:31.735
And I'm not absolutely convinced that the method I use in life system

17:31.715 --> 17:33.077
the correct one.

17:33.097 --> 17:35.560
Well, they use it inter-page, they do page splitting.

17:36.081 --> 17:39.205
So they are altering the, they remind it in many cases.

17:39.986 --> 17:43.090
So whether or not it's actually the story is what it was.

17:43.210 --> 17:47.776
There's been a lot of learning on these experiments down there as far as I mean.

17:47.796 --> 17:51.601
And I was viewing these just two days ago, so it's a scene.

17:51.742 --> 17:52.803
Yeah, scene.

17:52.823 --> 17:53.043
Yeah, yeah.

17:53.063 --> 18:00.053
That's, this trip is all about this whole concept of book culture and attitudes on books.

18:00.073 --> 18:01.114
But apparently, with

18:01.432 --> 18:10.923
Describe, if you would, if you can, the attitude of the Swedish people towards their literature, their books.

18:10.943 --> 18:15.007
Is this a formation of the book in your view?

18:15.027 --> 18:15.989
No, no, no.

18:16.049 --> 18:19.192
Not like the French novel.

18:19.212 --> 18:19.753
I'm sorry to say.

18:19.773 --> 18:20.494
No, quite right.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.696
No, no, no.

18:22.716 --> 18:23.457
In the tweets.

18:24.972 --> 18:28.657
First of all, Sweden is a small country.

18:28.897 --> 18:36.488
Sweden was not very long ago a poor country with a small bourgeoisie and a small clergy and a few million government.

18:36.968 --> 18:42.335
And most of them were peasants and poor people.

18:42.876 --> 18:51.688
I mean, it's just during the last hundred and twenty or thirty years that the social condition had changed

18:52.732 --> 18:59.558
And basically, especially after the Second World War, the Soviet condition had changed to total.

18:59.578 --> 19:02.067
So now we can move on with the British nation

19:02.401 --> 19:16.256
And in a way, it was a rich nation even before, but it was just the clergy and the small bourgeoisie and the small duvillity that we had here and some officers of the army, et cetera.

19:16.276 --> 19:21.642
I mean, they concentrated in the small cities that were in the cities of Stockholm.

19:22.042 --> 19:30.231
And what I will say about that is that if you compare Sweden, let's say to Germany, that has almost two...

19:30.667 --> 19:37.656
a development and a tradition that we are lacking in Swinghamid.

19:38.075 --> 19:43.303
If you think of Sweden, a hundred years ago, there were two universities here, Uppsala and Lund.

19:43.323 --> 19:51.356
And the main task of these universities, very long to do, to educate the clergy and learn from what they need.

19:51.376 --> 20:02.133
And the research work in the modern sense of the world wasn't started in Sweden until, and very generalizing of it started until the end of the 19th century.

20:02.874 --> 20:06.259
And imagine the immigration base to the states here.

20:06.577 --> 20:10.747
Why did people emigrate from Sweden in the 1950s and 1970s?

20:10.947 --> 20:23.758
Of course, they were so damn cool, they couldn't live half the more, they had to save their lives and secure their living and they wouldn't have left Sweden, just so on.

20:23.738 --> 20:31.485
enormous bank of work and software that were combined with immigration.

20:31.825 --> 20:40.594
Well, the city I live in near in Massachusetts, near Worcester, Massachusetts, has a huge Swedish population.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.917
There are several Swedish churches and several territories.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.818
Why did the Swedish leave that country?

20:45.838 --> 20:49.822
But it was so cool and so interesting to live.

20:49.842 --> 20:52.024
I mean, they had to do something and they did it.

20:52.004 --> 21:06.139
And what I say with that, you're asking about the traditional education in this country, I would say then that the basis for educated people, freeing people, is in fact very small.

21:07.020 --> 21:12.326
But how is it that the Nobel Prize, which comes from this country, is considered the great literary award in the world?

21:12.346 --> 21:14.248
It's so much money, of course.

21:14.268 --> 21:15.970
You get a lot of money.

21:16.169 --> 21:18.151
How much is £6 million?

21:18.211 --> 21:19.893
An enormous price.

21:19.913 --> 21:24.758
I mean it's just the size of the heap of money.

21:24.798 --> 21:27.981
It was the first such price.

21:28.061 --> 21:29.062
Yes, yes, yes.

21:29.422 --> 21:34.848
It started in 19... before the... about 1900, 1900.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.151
It's much money.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.755
If you give me £6 million without typing...

21:41.735 --> 21:45.964
It's almost one million dollars.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.349
It's a lot of money, isn't it?

21:48.891 --> 21:51.035
But it's more than the money versus the prestige.

21:51.115 --> 21:53.080
Of course.

21:53.841 --> 21:54.463
Of course.

21:54.483 --> 21:56.908
But that's because it was the first at that level.

21:57.175 --> 21:59.018
That's right.

21:59.139 --> 22:02.224
And of course, it's worldwide.

22:02.304 --> 22:12.302
It's not just the Pulitzer Prize in my country, which is just an American, you know, or the Booker, which is British speaking, and the Prix de Goncourt, which is French.

22:12.322 --> 22:13.565
The Nobel is the whole world.

22:13.865 --> 22:14.847
But of course,

22:15.569 --> 22:26.885
It is kind of paradoxical when you say this is not necessarily a country of the book, and yet this country does give the world's greatest nothing to do.

22:27.006 --> 22:37.120
But Nobel, which was the founder of this, he wasn't much in Sweden, because he was in Russia.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.704
Yes, he was most of the time in St.

22:39.904 --> 22:43.770
Petersburg and all around, and doing business from France.

22:43.750 --> 22:51.200
But yesterday, the attention of the literary world was focused on Stockman.

22:51.741 --> 22:53.863
This is an interesting explanation.

22:54.364 --> 22:57.268
This happens long to year.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.671
And is there always speculation around here?

22:59.831 --> 23:00.452
Yeah.

23:00.472 --> 23:02.114
So the people do talk about that.

23:02.195 --> 23:04.037
They never get right.

23:04.743 --> 23:13.492
I never experienced in my memory that you could find out who would get the prize.

23:14.153 --> 23:14.373
No.

23:15.954 --> 23:19.158
They always find somebody that you never thought of.

23:19.178 --> 23:22.641
It's not quite true, but I mean it's very obvious.

23:22.661 --> 23:28.387
But this year there has been some trouble with theatres in Sweden.

23:29.368 --> 23:32.151
So now the prize goes to playwrights.

23:32.131 --> 23:35.716
In Italy.

23:36.517 --> 23:41.124
I've heard that idea, but I don't know.

23:41.204 --> 23:45.851
But I've never heard of this guy no one before, I have to be honest with you.

23:45.951 --> 23:54.524
In fact, I think he has been playing more extreme than in Italy, because in Italy he is not national.

23:54.544 --> 23:56.907
He is not national, and Italy is not Italian.

23:56.887 --> 24:02.053
Only Moby Academy is doing it.

24:02.193 --> 24:04.777
Even the Pope has condemned this person.

24:05.057 --> 24:06.879
I didn't do that.

24:06.899 --> 24:11.865
Because he is blaspheming for their only child human people.

24:11.885 --> 24:15.670
So I wonder what their attitude would be to his work.

24:15.970 --> 24:19.174
I think I would take that for a compliment.

24:19.435 --> 24:26.303
Apart from that, I think he is not an important author.

24:26.283 --> 24:28.053
This is the main thing.

24:28.073 --> 24:30.205
He is a good player.

24:30.326 --> 24:32.317
He is a good player.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.323
He is a good player.

24:34.231 --> 24:42.083
Well, for instance, I chucked Tennessee Williams, of course, being an American to me, is one of the great playwrights of our time.

24:42.103 --> 24:43.705
Or Olby is still alive.

24:43.725 --> 24:45.347
I think he's been dead for quite some time.

24:45.608 --> 24:47.731
But Olby is dead.

24:47.751 --> 24:49.113
Tennessee Williams is dead.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.156
But Olby is still alive, I think.

24:51.176 --> 24:51.717
Or Olby is.

24:52.137 --> 24:53.579
I interviewed him last year.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.521
He's very, very much.

24:54.581 --> 24:56.043
I just want to feel a surprise to you.

24:56.063 --> 24:59.428
That would be something to give to Edvard Olby.

24:59.408 --> 25:01.050
All Tennessee Williams, but he is dead.

25:01.090 --> 25:03.372
I mean, Tennessee Williams would have been quite right.

25:03.392 --> 25:05.854
And he has started a new tradition in theatres.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.255
He's a poet, too, I mean.

25:07.275 --> 25:08.977
He's beautiful to read.

25:09.718 --> 25:12.620
He's a clown in Italy.

25:13.001 --> 25:14.522
Or Arthur Miller, who is alive.

25:14.582 --> 25:16.124
Oh, why not?

25:16.224 --> 25:19.447
But of course, he... How was it?

25:19.507 --> 25:21.849
Did Eugene O'Neill receive the prize or not?

25:21.909 --> 25:22.290
He did.

25:22.850 --> 25:23.991
That was right.

25:24.011 --> 25:25.192
I think that was right.

25:25.212 --> 25:28.215
Eugene O'Neill, I think, was the first American to win one.

25:28.776 --> 25:29.196
I think.

25:30.323 --> 25:33.508
I think Eugene O'Neill was the first one.

25:34.390 --> 25:34.911
I think so.

25:35.171 --> 25:39.198
Pearl Bach one, which was a total disaster.

25:39.378 --> 25:40.901
She's even forgotten enough.

25:40.921 --> 25:42.764
And Joe Crawl, of course.

25:43.045 --> 25:45.509
What is his name on that?

25:45.529 --> 25:46.651
He's very pro-strat.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.754
Well, there's Hemingway.

25:48.794 --> 25:49.896
No, not Hemingway.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.998
John Steinbeck.

25:50.978 --> 25:52.681
not in Saul Bellow.

25:53.242 --> 25:58.450
Yes, the Himmelberg, but there was one in the... Isaac Singer, who is a Yiddish.

25:58.510 --> 26:01.094
No, but earlier, earlier, there was one earlier.

26:01.935 --> 26:02.857
I think Clare Lewis.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.321
No, not even that.

26:05.821 --> 26:09.006
He wrote, he writes without... William Parker.

26:09.026 --> 26:09.467
Thank you.

26:09.607 --> 26:12.151
Thank you.

26:12.893 --> 26:14.455
That one I cannot read.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.725
He's not my cup of tea.

26:17.086 --> 26:20.214
He is regarded as probably the greatest American writer.

26:20.354 --> 26:22.961
I know, but I can't read him.

26:23.402 --> 26:24.545
Do you try to read him in English?

26:24.765 --> 26:26.510
Yes, it's difficult.

26:26.931 --> 26:27.853
I like him.

26:28.188 --> 26:29.050
Do you like him?

26:29.110 --> 26:29.571
I'm going to hear that.

26:29.831 --> 26:32.596
He's probably written three great novels, which is a lot.

26:32.817 --> 26:33.899
He's written one great novel.

26:33.999 --> 26:38.307
Light in August has been translated into Swedish.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.850
Light in August is wonderful.

26:43.377 --> 26:47.665
By the way, Light in August has nothing to do with Light in August.

26:47.645 --> 26:51.495
I will wait if your light is too heavy, isn't it?

26:51.515 --> 26:55.666
Everybody thinks light has to do with a sun or something.

26:56.549 --> 27:00.439
As far as I've been told, you can be light if you...

27:00.622 --> 27:02.965
have only a kilogram weight.

27:03.025 --> 27:04.066
Isn't that so easy?

27:04.406 --> 27:11.354
And now it is always a means to be not heavy in horse, not bright in horse.

27:11.394 --> 27:14.178
Tell us a little bit, are you a librarian by profession?

27:14.198 --> 27:15.479
Yes, by training?

27:15.579 --> 27:19.123
Yes, I've been here for 30 years.

27:19.143 --> 27:23.088
And I don't want to take up too much of your time.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.090
I'm very grateful that you agreed.

27:25.130 --> 27:29.295
Is there any chance we could just say a little bit of what's been done here?

27:29.798 --> 27:32.863
You will see the Reading Room.

27:32.923 --> 27:36.248
Have you been to the Reading Room?

27:36.649 --> 27:37.250
Yes.

27:38.111 --> 27:41.957
Do you realise what I said?

27:41.977 --> 27:49.829
Many buildings in Stockholm were constructed in that way at the end of the 19th century.

27:49.849 --> 27:52.313
Take the Opera House here.

27:52.580 --> 27:55.407
staircase of the opera house here.

27:55.427 --> 27:59.317
It's exactly as the big opera, only 10 times smaller.

28:00.941 --> 28:02.665
That's really true.

28:02.706 --> 28:09.222
And there are other examples of how deeply French Paris architecture, India and Stockholm,

28:09.202 --> 28:11.667
at the end of the 1960s.

28:12.048 --> 28:21.729
The whole Wunwald system of Stockholm was copied, or not smacked Paris, I mean, you know, that Paris was totally transformed in the 1870s.

28:21.749 --> 28:28.003
And then there was a very, a very big man for what are nowadays called Lindh Hagen who decided that

28:27.983 --> 28:37.452
around the big streets to be with Paris.

28:37.872 --> 28:44.939
If you could, I understand I'm asking you what the technical quote, right?

28:45.259 --> 28:53.707
If you could give me your opinion of the significance of the library that I saw about this this morning.

28:53.927 --> 28:57.450
Yes.

28:57.785 --> 29:00.470
is from the aesthetic point of view fantastic.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.777
I mean the room is wonderful.

29:04.878 --> 29:12.251
Especially as one house, my own institution, I am a little proud of it today and I'm glad they keep it as they do.

29:12.511 --> 29:15.777
But the books that are standing there

29:16.077 --> 29:19.541
are all belongings of the royal Bernadotte family.

29:19.561 --> 29:24.187
I mean, it's not that interesting, but it's very well done and beautiful to look at.

29:24.207 --> 29:35.200
But all the queens and all the kings of the Bernadotte, starting with Marshall Bernadotte, in the beginning of the 19th century are there, and it's a beautiful room.

29:35.280 --> 29:41.067
And if you're interested in the history of the royal family, this is the place you want to live.

29:41.087 --> 29:44.751
In terms of trying to get a sense of the character of the books,

29:44.933 --> 30:00.867
i think really what you see is what what is there more than the content of the books and visually it's a spectacular but if you go as if i remember rightly the the libraries of the of the

30:01.167 --> 30:03.771
different queens and kings are kept together.

30:03.791 --> 30:04.272
That's right.

30:04.392 --> 30:09.340
If you look at the Queen Sophia, you'll find that she was interested in what is, what.

30:09.440 --> 30:19.196
I mean, so there is a, to get an idea of the character of the, of the different royal persons.

30:19.216 --> 30:21.399
Tell the story about the persons.

30:21.840 --> 30:26.247
Apart from that, it was a very good series this summer.

30:26.267 --> 30:27.529
Did you see that series?

30:27.509 --> 30:29.411
that we presented this summer.

30:29.431 --> 30:41.106
There was one program about every Bernadette Queen, and it was very well done, even if you have no interest in drawing family, what very few people have in this country, I would say.

30:42.247 --> 30:51.979
It was so well done, and it gave so much of the atmosphere of the different periods when these poor ladies lived here.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.741
I mean, they were brought from the door.

30:53.761 --> 30:55.103
It was cold in Sweden.

30:55.083 --> 31:10.638
They've been the first one, this year, who has become famous to her at a moment, written by a film, this lady called Cernico, and she never liked Sweden, and she longed to go back to France, and she did in fact... Never came back to France.

31:10.658 --> 31:22.069
Yeah, but she came back, she came back, but she passed for some long years in France, and she wouldn't sit in those cold, in those cold houses.

31:24.091 --> 31:35.507
Stockholm is built on granite.

31:35.527 --> 31:40.754
So are we now under sea level, you say?

31:42.457 --> 31:51.870
Is this new here?

31:52.593 --> 32:15.764
Going down below sea level.

32:16.385 --> 32:20.090
I love it.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.992
At Cornell University.

32:22.327 --> 32:30.637
Cordell just built a beautiful library, totally underground, six levels.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.782
But it's not quite as big as it is.

32:34.802 --> 32:36.465
It's not nearly as wide, I'm sure.

32:36.485 --> 32:47.338
It's a very good idea of how these things come from.

32:47.723 --> 32:49.266
This is the old building.

32:49.466 --> 32:50.868
You entered on the other side here.

32:50.888 --> 32:52.972
This is the north side here.

32:53.913 --> 33:05.032
And we took the lift here and went down through this thing there, down in one of these two huge underground stacks that we are now in.

33:05.072 --> 33:13.005
We are standing on the third floor in annex A, and this is annex B. And if you look here, you can see a tent.

33:13.222 --> 33:18.109
This is a tenth.

33:19.411 --> 33:19.831
A tenth?

33:20.092 --> 33:20.913
A tenth.

33:21.554 --> 33:21.954
Look here.

33:22.896 --> 33:26.541
One, two, three, four, five levels in this one.

33:26.801 --> 33:30.967
One, two, three, four, five levels in B. And what is the distance in that direction?

33:30.987 --> 33:34.031
I can't tell you.

33:34.532 --> 33:38.678
Well, I would say it's about... I'd say it's 100 yards.

33:38.738 --> 33:41.642
I'd say it's the size of a football field, easily.

33:41.926 --> 33:47.480
as an old football player, in either direction, I would say easily 200 yards.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.928
And 200 yards, that's an estimate.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.597
And that's one time.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.061
And it's ten times that.

33:56.562 --> 33:59.108
And we use today seven of these.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.243
So you left three open.

34:01.403 --> 34:02.986
Germans did the same thing.

34:04.829 --> 34:08.334
So you are estimating you're able to go how far?

34:08.374 --> 34:09.335
To what year?

34:09.355 --> 34:09.836
2040?

34:09.856 --> 34:10.197
2050.

34:10.357 --> 34:24.238
But in reality, I think it will do forever, because with the virtual reality that is supposed to come here, we don't need that much space in future.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.682
So you're quite...

34:26.965 --> 34:34.754
sanguine about the fact that... But you are expecting that books will be replaced.

34:34.814 --> 34:35.534
Not all of them.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.616
Never a novel.

34:36.696 --> 34:38.257
Never a novel.

34:38.297 --> 34:48.789
You must be able to lie in bed and read a novel or sit in a train and you can't expect yourself to bring in an apparatus to read a book in the bed.

34:48.809 --> 34:51.912
But you expect that the number of publications are gone down.

34:52.013 --> 34:54.195
Take the telephone catalog.

34:55.677 --> 34:56.377
Perfect.

34:56.478 --> 34:56.938
Absolutely.

34:57.205 --> 35:01.091
Encyclopedias, which are constantly being updated.

35:01.271 --> 35:07.200
The Oxford English Dictionary, the Encyclopedia Britannica are always being updated.

35:08.142 --> 35:13.350
As I told you, Stockholm is standing on granite.

35:14.672 --> 35:16.515
Even Royal Library is standing on granite.

35:17.797 --> 35:23.145
That was the condition to be able to

35:23.615 --> 35:30.922
We made this whole by dynamite.

35:31.703 --> 35:32.324
Dynamite.

35:32.344 --> 35:34.446
What is the process when you're pumped?

35:34.546 --> 35:37.990
What's called in English?

35:38.010 --> 35:39.011
Well, it's explosives.

35:39.911 --> 35:48.460
And all the damage was taken away by noise that went up to the ground there and this way.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.601
Blasted is what we saw.

35:49.621 --> 35:51.123
Thank you.

35:51.143 --> 35:51.343
Thank you.

35:51.492 --> 35:59.920
And when the blasting was finished, these stacks were built in the room.

36:00.340 --> 36:01.121
You see my phone?

36:01.141 --> 36:10.329
So there is a room between the walls of the room and the houses standing down there.

36:11.090 --> 36:12.071
This is really wonderful.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.793
How far below sea level would you say we are?

36:14.833 --> 36:17.716
Not many meters.

36:17.736 --> 36:19.097
25 meters below.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.959
Oh, there it is.

36:22.087 --> 36:27.112
Twenty-five meters, that's— And the whole is 150 meters long, 150 meters long.

36:27.533 --> 36:28.854
I guessed pretty good, didn't I?

36:29.114 --> 36:33.379
150 in each—you mean 150 that way?

36:33.419 --> 36:34.060
All together.

36:34.080 --> 36:34.560
All together.

36:34.580 --> 36:38.304
How does that translate into feet, do you know?

36:38.344 --> 36:43.409
About three or four feet in one meter.

36:44.090 --> 36:44.791
So I was right.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.234
It's more than I said.

36:47.294 --> 36:49.596
It's about—I said 80 feet.

36:50.386 --> 36:52.649
Three times 80, that would be 200.

36:53.229 --> 36:54.671
I said 300, so I guessed.

36:54.811 --> 36:55.732
That was very close.

36:56.533 --> 36:57.374
In each direction.

36:57.394 --> 36:59.157
So it's 300 meters altogether, right?

37:00.598 --> 37:01.680
No.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.623
150 from that end to that end, or 150 from there to here?

37:04.984 --> 37:07.687
From that end, yes, that's true.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.509
Not 300.

37:09.529 --> 37:09.930
150.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.972
And 110,000 cubic meters?

37:12.188 --> 37:14.432
That's the capacity?

37:14.452 --> 37:15.233
450 yards.

37:15.253 --> 37:22.445
This time here is how much granite that was lost or carried away from here, cubic meters.

37:24.468 --> 37:26.511
And where do they take the granite?

37:27.373 --> 37:30.257
It's a very interesting story.

37:30.317 --> 37:38.230
They are building new railway lines around Stockholm now, especially to the airport.

37:38.497 --> 37:41.461
The base is for the New Raven.

37:41.922 --> 37:42.743
So it's being used.

37:43.264 --> 37:44.085
And what's the 33,000?

37:45.206 --> 37:46.027
What does that mean?

37:46.047 --> 37:57.623
33,000 truckloads of granite were removed from the site, right?

37:57.944 --> 37:59.045
How many a day?

38:01.068 --> 38:02.710
Well, we could figure it out.

38:02.730 --> 38:04.032
How long was the project in?

38:04.349 --> 38:04.809
1992?

38:05.530 --> 38:08.673
The blasting lasted two years, I think.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.958
Two years of blasting, and so it was 1992 to 1997?

38:13.358 --> 38:16.201
Only two years of blasting, from 1992 to 1994.

38:16.321 --> 38:29.014
Then, after that, they built, the underground houses were built in the throne that they're going to drop, like great Gothic cathedrals.

38:30.315 --> 38:33.018
That's absolutely amazing.

38:33.038 --> 38:33.158
Yeah.

38:33.830 --> 38:35.311
That's really spectacular.

38:35.752 --> 38:46.903
And you used, you installed compact shelving, of course, which gives you... Not everywhere, because the books don't go away with compact shelving, and so all rare books are standing on non-compact.

38:47.323 --> 38:55.131
All rare books are standing still, still, and not, I mean, going through and crawl like that, as they do with compact shelving.

38:55.151 --> 38:59.755
Compact shelving has, has got, I think it's earlier, I'm not here last one.

38:59.775 --> 39:00.456
Pros and cons.

39:00.516 --> 39:03.499
Pros and cons.

39:03.580 --> 39:07.145
Yeah.

39:07.165 --> 39:07.806
I've got Nicholas.

39:07.886 --> 39:08.166
Good.

39:11.290 --> 39:11.751
That's good.

39:12.572 --> 39:13.393
Have you seen this before?

39:13.473 --> 39:13.714
No.

39:14.715 --> 39:15.716
I knew about it.

39:15.736 --> 39:17.218
What are you doing today?

39:17.419 --> 39:20.343
I'm actually selling those to you sometimes.

39:20.363 --> 39:20.503
Really?

39:20.523 --> 39:24.368
And I'm doing the book, International Book Search Service.

39:24.388 --> 39:27.172
So I have a lot of contacts with Indian Samsung.

39:27.252 --> 39:28.013
Oh, cute.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.535
What are you doing today?

39:29.635 --> 39:31.377
Where is that?

39:31.798 --> 39:33.300
Where is that?

39:33.533 --> 39:56.493
Did you know about all that granite and everything?

39:57.314 --> 39:58.917
I saw the trucks!

40:00.010 --> 40:02.915
I must have seen an ending when it was going on.

40:02.935 --> 40:09.926
Actually, I was trying to find the orchestra and suddenly it became interrupted by this rebuilding.

40:14.253 --> 40:24.229
Did you see what you did?

40:25.542 --> 40:43.889
The catalogue is on the internet.

40:44.230 --> 40:45.231
It's the same here.

40:45.712 --> 40:46.132
Everywhere.

40:47.354 --> 40:49.678
Now this is called Lass.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.280
But what do you call the room?

40:51.597 --> 40:54.001
The reading room.

40:54.021 --> 40:58.147
What is that word up there?

40:58.167 --> 40:58.508
Reading rooms.

40:58.528 --> 41:01.292
Reading rooms.

41:01.312 --> 41:02.875
This is pure.

41:02.895 --> 41:13.251
And they put out a lamp.

41:13.451 --> 41:15.214
This is all a lamp.

41:15.234 --> 41:16.796
These are the combined words.

41:16.816 --> 41:17.237
Oh, it's beautiful.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.140
If you have been in the reading room since you may have been

41:19.745 --> 41:27.999
It's exactly the same order, that the radio essentially is double speed.

41:28.019 --> 41:36.252
It's facing north, it was very open, and it's facing, you see, you know, very hot summer days, it's agreeable.

41:36.272 --> 41:36.693
It's beautiful.

41:37.294 --> 41:42.823
There's actually lighting now from before.

41:42.843 --> 41:44.246
And how long is this room?

41:44.266 --> 41:45.027
It's beautiful.

41:46.660 --> 41:59.693
that you kept it.

41:59.853 --> 42:02.356
The best of the old.

42:03.977 --> 42:09.483
That was before the concrete was invented.

42:09.543 --> 42:15.469
They used forge iron to the end of the 19th century.

42:18.723 --> 42:20.665
Beautiful.

42:20.685 --> 42:21.206
That's great.

42:26.032 --> 42:35.022
There's rare books up there.

42:35.042 --> 42:41.350
Do you charge your reading fees?

42:41.730 --> 42:41.910
No.

42:42.932 --> 42:45.034
Good figure out.

42:45.841 --> 42:48.986
Germany now, too.

42:50.668 --> 42:54.273
Just started with the new library.

42:54.394 --> 42:54.814
In Leipzig.

42:54.854 --> 42:55.375
In Frankfurt.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.937
They had to pay in Frankfurt.

42:56.957 --> 42:58.039
Just now, just started.

42:58.079 --> 42:59.061
I was there two days ago.

43:00.423 --> 43:03.307
They said very cheap, only 5 Dirichmarks a week.

43:04.709 --> 43:06.411
Something like that, or 30 a year.

43:08.174 --> 43:09.837
But the point is, they're charging and they shouldn't.

43:12.100 --> 43:12.861
Absolutely.

43:15.929 --> 43:21.296
Well, that's wonderful.

43:21.316 --> 43:30.408
Thank you, and I will write you, and I will let you know how this works.

43:32.211 --> 43:32.832
You're very kind.

43:33.072 --> 43:40.722
Thank you again.
