WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:05.891
I think just we head out to the restaurant.

00:06.652 --> 00:08.153
I was talking about Harrison.

00:08.173 --> 00:21.905
I, Bernard Cohen, who was in our, running our history of science department, took me down to see Harrison, I suppose, sometime in the 60s.

00:22.806 --> 00:26.609
And at that time, he was living in New York, and he had these books.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.090
I was really impressed.

00:28.150 --> 00:31.573
They were three deep in the shelves, so that

00:31.975 --> 00:36.820
take out the first row, there was a second row, there was a third row behind those.

00:36.840 --> 00:44.968
And he had so many, uh, little, uh, textbooks, the sphere of Sacrobasco and so on.

00:45.008 --> 01:00.784
He was very fastidious about his collations and he was very proud of the fact that he was more or less single-handedly making scientific book collecting a respectable subject, which he had done by also the

01:01.574 --> 01:08.403
exhibition at the Grolier Club on 100 books famous in science.

01:08.423 --> 01:10.065
That was basically his list, wasn't it?

01:10.085 --> 01:11.567
That was basically his list.

01:11.587 --> 01:29.590
He got a lot of help in making the list from Professor Cohen, and Cohen in turn consulted with a number of other specialists to make sure that the representation of different disciplines was about balanced rights.

01:30.211 --> 01:36.118
Did you ever get any indication for Harrison why he stopped collecting?

01:36.138 --> 01:41.004
Professor, that's an enigma for me, like an Arthur Houghton or a Marsden Perry.

01:41.465 --> 01:52.658
The same thing happened to him that I saw happening to Berndibner and other people, that he just couldn't quite cope with the fact that the books were rising in price.

01:54.190 --> 02:06.669
And in a certain way, yes, we want the two luncheons, one with the prawns with lobster sauce.

02:10.515 --> 02:15.482
He was still collecting, but he was beginning to explore another field, which was early photography.

02:15.983 --> 02:20.029
He had practically captured the market on Talbot's.

02:20.279 --> 02:22.743
pencil of nature.

02:22.783 --> 02:28.531
And he was also big into Sir Thomas Phillips.

02:28.551 --> 02:33.539
So he was still very actively going after both of those kinds of materials.

02:34.601 --> 02:38.246
But he had dropped out on the history of science things.

02:38.266 --> 02:40.870
And then of course he put his collection up for sale.

02:41.238 --> 02:45.483
And this turned out to create a big brouhaha, which you found out about.

02:45.503 --> 02:48.766
Not really.

02:48.786 --> 02:50.848
Not really.

02:50.868 --> 03:06.825
He had promised a lot of institutions various favors, but he was reluctant to give them the books outright because he wanted the books to be written up in the catalog as he wanted the catalog to be the monument to his collection.

03:06.845 --> 03:10.489
So he was disappointed.

03:10.509 --> 03:11.110
He felt that

03:11.731 --> 03:28.213
Sotheby's had not described the books fully enough or properly enough to show the significance as to why he bought them and in turn he gave a lot of money to institutions so that they could go and bid for his books.

03:28.313 --> 03:29.855
Yeah, see that's not unprecedented.

03:29.995 --> 03:32.759
Streeter did that and Brindley did that too.

03:32.879 --> 03:41.350
He urged them to go through John Fleming and the result of which was that John Fleming bought

03:41.802 --> 04:00.601
nearly half the lots in the first auction and this created quite a stir because they felt it was illegal to sort of for the owner to hand out money to buy the books at his own auction.

04:01.382 --> 04:11.472
It may have been done but it was not considered the honorable thing to do the result of which was that the dealers deliberately sat on their hands for the second auction and

04:11.654 --> 04:15.057
and bought for their customers, but refused to buy for stock.

04:15.598 --> 04:35.758
So the second auction flopped so badly that Sotheby's said, you know, we can't have this, and there was some sort of a falling out, and Harrison took back the rest of the books.

04:36.238 --> 04:39.822
So that's why there are only two catalogs going from A through H.

04:41.152 --> 05:04.881
And the I through the rest of the alphabet was never auctioned So eventually he sold it off sort of piece by piece to the Krauss company But he He did hang on to things and finally one time when I was down and

05:05.266 --> 05:11.693
he agreed that Harvard should have all the Napiers and just essentially gathered them up and handed them over.

05:11.953 --> 05:22.846
It was really wonderful because otherwise Harvard had, as this has happened to many art museums, buying around what you were expecting from a donor.

05:24.287 --> 05:34.058
And in this particular case, those very important STC items would probably be forever missing from Harvard, excepting that Harrison

05:34.628 --> 05:59.877
understood that they had been in his hundred books famous and science catalog and were the outstanding thing that harvard lacked from that catalog so harvard got them anyway well he decided to give them to us it was it was largely because i had been going down and talking with him every year sort of rain or shine because he he would blow hot and cold he was outraged at

06:00.295 --> 06:02.940
Harvard during the student troubles of the 60s.

06:03.201 --> 06:04.944
He thought they were conceding too much.

06:05.525 --> 06:14.001
He had a number of other grievances and he was always

06:14.403 --> 06:16.587
You know, fairly irascible.

06:18.470 --> 06:21.435
So Harvard did get the, I remember just a couple of years ago.

06:21.475 --> 06:23.037
Harvard got wonderful things from him.

06:23.077 --> 06:26.723
Harvard is greatly in his debt.

06:26.743 --> 06:32.192
But I guess sadly he never did get the catalog as a monument to his collection that he wanted.

06:32.212 --> 06:32.693
That's right.

06:32.713 --> 06:35.137
Never, never then existed.

06:35.157 --> 06:37.321
So he lost on both sides, didn't he?

06:37.621 --> 06:41.187
At least there would have been a Hornburg public collection here at Harvard.

06:41.740 --> 06:49.186
There is a part of a Horvath collection here at Harvard.

06:49.226 --> 07:01.417
It includes the Naratio Prima, which is the book which, until the Copernicus went for so high, held the record as being the highest auctioned book in the history of science.

07:02.077 --> 07:07.542
And now it ties with the Copernicus.

07:08.963 --> 07:11.545
Well, now you indicated on the way over that

07:12.031 --> 07:16.357
You're a collector yourself, and we have really touched on that.

07:16.377 --> 07:20.643
Maybe you can tell me a little bit about your own collecting activities.

07:23.587 --> 07:30.637
I admired Harrison's collection of books, and the whole idea of early books I sort of caught on to as a result of going down and looking at his things.

07:33.341 --> 07:41.953
I did not have much disposable income, but I did buy

07:42.727 --> 07:45.030
a rare book from the Krauss company.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.772
I still have the receipt for it.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.474
I think I paid $12 for it.

07:51.038 --> 08:02.653
I happen to recognize it as being the one volume out of a great long run that had a very, had a paper of very great interest to me from 1770.

08:02.753 --> 08:05.877
So I bought this Singleton volume.

08:06.258 --> 08:10.042
It was just out of broken debt, so it wasn't worth very much.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.025
I suppose that was around 1960,

08:12.612 --> 08:15.917
We can look when we get back, 64 maybe.

08:17.659 --> 08:32.640
Then I found some Ephemerides, and I was rather interested in that for my research.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.746
These are books that show positions of planets.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.252
I remember buying one from Blackwell's,

08:42.143 --> 08:47.470
I probably paid $150 for it, a book from 1532.

08:47.490 --> 08:59.466
And that was my entree into serious book collecting.

08:59.486 --> 09:03.612
Were you collecting them as artifacts or as adjuncts to your collection?

09:03.811 --> 09:06.393
academic professional career?

09:06.834 --> 09:22.508
At first it was very much as adjunct to what I was doing because the books were useful to me in looking up planetary positions and I made a lot of calculations to show how accurate the old tables were.

09:27.313 --> 09:33.058
So I kept at it gradually moving

09:33.545 --> 09:35.107
farther and farther upscale.

09:35.928 --> 09:40.874
I've got a lot of very rare things.

09:40.994 --> 09:46.420
I've had a number of things that were unique in America.

09:53.048 --> 10:02.539
For a long time, I had what I believed to be the only copy of the first edition of Michael Mestland's astronomy textbook.

10:02.789 --> 10:04.792
He was the teacher of Johannes Kepler.

10:06.695 --> 10:15.608
And it's an interesting copy because it was owned by John Evelyn, the English diarist, and it has the date in it and the place where he bought it.

10:15.828 --> 10:19.874
And he mentions in his diary buying books at that particular time.

10:19.955 --> 10:22.218
How much has gotten that in England?

10:22.238 --> 10:28.307
Yes, as a matter of fact, Korich has pointed out to me that it was coming up in the Evelyn auction.

10:28.507 --> 10:35.116
And since that was not a collection of history of science, I didn't have the specialist dealers bidding for it.

10:35.597 --> 10:37.600
So they bid for it for me and got it for me.

10:37.620 --> 10:37.860
That's nice.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.364
That's absolutely nice.

10:40.384 --> 10:43.549
And I notice that you have much of the collection in your office.

10:44.029 --> 10:45.792
I assume it's there and not at home?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.494
That's more fireproof there.

10:50.559 --> 10:53.523
So it's there for practical reasons.

10:53.543 --> 10:56.387
Yes, it's expensive for me to do that.

10:56.587 --> 11:00.671
because the insurance on the books would be a great deal less if I could have them at home.

11:06.777 --> 11:08.338
Is it pleasure of ownership?

11:09.620 --> 11:14.785
I use them regularly in teaching, in seminars or small classes.

11:15.546 --> 11:22.172
I sometimes take a typical book along and even show it in my large lecture course.

11:22.405 --> 11:35.704
Most of these don't have reprints.

11:35.724 --> 11:40.951
So the first edition is the only edition?

11:40.971 --> 11:48.722
It's interesting to be able to walk into class and say, this is Descartes' Principles of Philosophy.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.366
It's the foundation of the

11:51.768 --> 12:07.532
Cartesian system, which was absolutely in the vogue at the time that Newton wrote his Principia, and to be able to sort of hold it up and turn the pages and then show the slides enlarging those figures.

12:11.237 --> 12:19.750
Or when we're talking about Tycho Brahe and how when he was a teenager he saw that the

12:19.915 --> 12:22.960
prediction of where Jupiter and Saturn would be.

12:24.001 --> 12:27.727
And their great conjunction in 1563 was wrong.

12:28.768 --> 12:31.613
And to be able to hold up the book and say, right here is where it is.

12:32.033 --> 12:38.082
This is exactly the kind of set of tables that he had where he was looking that up.

12:38.102 --> 12:47.557
You're familiar with the courses that George Parker Winship taught here at Harvard, that Bill Jackson, I guess, taught later, and that Roger teaches now.

12:47.577 --> 12:48.538
I know about those.

12:49.092 --> 12:53.857
And I do take the history of science graduate students.

12:53.877 --> 13:00.263
Now we'll switch off on this as soon as the other plate comes.

13:05.188 --> 13:18.441
I take the, yes please, I take the history of science students in and show them books, try to pick out books where they can find interesting things by looking at the book itself as opposed to just knowing that the book exists.

13:20.125 --> 13:35.361
Roger did a paper on these courses, starting with Winship's course in 1915.

13:35.461 --> 13:44.870
I found out about the variance after I was well underway in the census.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.394
So there was no possibility, essentially, of checking them.

13:49.032 --> 14:04.351
It was funny because a colleague in Munich was so pleased with himself having found a variant and I pointed out to him that you're just using a facsimile of the book.

14:05.633 --> 14:14.183
You don't realize that that's simply a paste over which the individual has done and he's made it look so much like type but it isn't.

14:14.704 --> 14:18.128
That's an ink manuscript and that's not a printing variant.

14:19.171 --> 14:25.758
And he was so chagrined that he knocked himself out to find a variant.

14:26.218 --> 14:33.546
And he finally found one, and I don't even know where, because it really isn't that important to me.

14:33.586 --> 14:37.410
But, well, would it be significant in any way textually?

14:37.450 --> 14:38.231
Probably not.

14:38.251 --> 14:39.232
No, not textually.

14:41.134 --> 14:46.039
It's just a minor change in the types somewhere.

14:46.778 --> 14:55.507
I suppose one might have got something more out about the printing history to have followed that, but... I found out about way too late.

14:55.547 --> 14:57.149
There was no turning back at that point.

14:58.771 --> 15:15.469
I don't see really where they are so... Horvitz, famous... Probably the rarest book in Horvitz, 100 books famous in the history of science, or famous in science, I'm all set up, is the Lobachevsky.

15:15.888 --> 15:41.659
uh piece on the non-euclidean geometry and as far as i know haskell norman is the only person in the country to have a copy of it really when it came for the grolier club they had to borrow it from ussr it came just wrapped up in a newspaper with a string around it and everybody was so amazed that they trusted this thing so rare just to the post this way

15:41.858 --> 15:47.225
But as they thought about it more, they realized this was probably the only way they could have got it out of the Soviet Union.

15:47.826 --> 15:48.948
When was this?

15:48.968 --> 15:52.192
Well, it was the exhibition that gave rise to that book.

15:52.713 --> 15:56.138
So would that have been in 55 or something like that?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.804
And how the copy got out that Haskell bought, I don't know.

16:00.904 --> 16:04.409
But his book presumably will have some details.

16:04.429 --> 16:07.333
Maybe at least say where it came from.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.216
Well...

16:09.618 --> 16:11.800
There are a lot of things, you know, you talk.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.502
A lot of things you don't want to ask too many questions about.

16:13.522 --> 16:14.923
Well, you ask, but they don't want to answer.

16:16.405 --> 16:18.006
Mr. Scheide, he's a sweetheart of a man.

16:18.026 --> 16:19.007
I don't know if you know Bill Scheide.

16:19.408 --> 16:19.928
Oh, yeah, I do.

16:20.228 --> 16:20.609
Lovely man.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.833
And of course, a lot of the great things that he has, his father bought.

16:25.193 --> 16:30.118
Like the Blickling homily, you know, the only Anglo-Saxon manuscript in North America.

16:30.819 --> 16:32.821
It's named for the Blickling estate.

16:34.402 --> 16:39.507
But you don't want to talk, you don't want to invoke too deeply, because he's not the one who bought it.

16:39.638 --> 17:04.262
you know how the british government allowed that to slip out that's the one item that nicholas parker says when i asked him about it it's interesting because i always and then doing the copernic consensus copy down all the old shelf marks that are in the books i noticed that i took notes on that and uh

17:04.428 --> 17:20.587
One day I was just thinking about it and I don't know how how I thought about it this way I I knew that the in Milan at the Braden's a library there was a First edition in the catalog, but no first edition present.

17:20.988 --> 17:29.558
They have second editions But I had the shelf mark all of a sudden I thought I'm gonna check this shelf mark and what do you know it tried his copy and

17:30.584 --> 17:30.964
Wow.

17:31.225 --> 17:32.586
And that was bought in 1928.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.668
I saw that.

17:34.688 --> 17:35.889
I ran across it.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.151
However it was sprung, we don't know.

17:38.712 --> 17:53.005
But it was interesting just by that to be able to put it together because that copy had been given by another collector who had published a big book of his holdings in the 18th century.

17:54.246 --> 18:00.372
So otherwise, that copy would be completely missing, excepting that I just happened to thread it together.

18:01.128 --> 18:03.252
I go from the Haven chapter.

18:04.614 --> 18:06.397
Haven was so incensed.

18:06.858 --> 18:10.283
I think he said he was going to take all the books down to Arkansas or some other place.

18:10.444 --> 18:12.146
Did you know that they own a house in Arkansas?

18:12.387 --> 18:14.290
Of course, and the one in Acapulco, too.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.412
Right.

18:15.432 --> 18:21.482
So he felt really put upon to me.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.957
blocked by the people of Cambridge and tearing down those buildings.

18:26.217 --> 18:30.043
But you said that he actually went out there with a wrecker one day and started tearing stuff down.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.628
Well, he wasn't running the ball and crane.

18:33.209 --> 18:37.195
But the crane damaged the buildings so that they couldn't be restored.

18:37.235 --> 18:38.637
So they had to be torn down.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.342
So he succeeded to that extent.

18:41.482 --> 18:46.390
But he intended to put up a tax-free institute, which did have the residents in the city

18:47.618 --> 18:49.180
In something of an uproar.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.887
The residents were in an uproar because they thought it was Harvard expansionism.

18:54.188 --> 18:55.730
As a clandestine, as you said.

18:55.910 --> 18:57.433
Exactly.

18:59.215 --> 19:01.639
But his attitude was fury, I gather.

19:01.659 --> 19:02.380
Is that right?

19:02.400 --> 19:08.990
Yeah, he was quite upset to have that particular plan stymied.

19:10.051 --> 19:13.997
And, of course, he led from the Martin Luther September Bible, Houghton,

19:14.399 --> 19:15.801
Houghton Library for one of their exhibitions.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.223
Was he a member of the friends over there, do you think?

19:17.243 --> 19:17.624
Oh, yeah.

19:17.664 --> 19:21.710
He always was giving contributions.

19:22.511 --> 19:24.474
And they were always modest to us.

19:24.955 --> 19:30.042
But he paid for some dinners, I think, and so on.

19:30.062 --> 19:30.523
That was nice.

19:30.543 --> 19:32.426
In connection with some of the exhibitions.

19:35.170 --> 19:35.971
Very interesting.

19:38.195 --> 19:38.755
Of one.

19:39.176 --> 19:40.117
You're telling me about one.

19:40.198 --> 19:43.883
Wolf-lying adventure so that you get a flavor of

19:44.470 --> 19:46.012
what I'm up to as a collector.

19:46.413 --> 19:47.714
There's two things I'm going to show you.

19:47.754 --> 20:01.373
I'm going to show you the Castle of Knowledge, which is the one that our Freeman sold to me.

20:01.393 --> 20:04.517
These books are all arranged by country.

20:08.683 --> 20:10.866
We're looking at a little oak case.

20:11.369 --> 20:14.552
perhaps maybe 40 books, but if that many.

20:15.033 --> 20:15.834
Isn't that wonderful?

20:16.334 --> 20:23.161
It's the first vernacular astronomy in English from... And that's, what is that second word?

20:23.541 --> 20:24.602
That's not house, is it?

20:24.622 --> 20:25.283
Castle.

20:26.204 --> 20:31.309
Castle of Knowledge, and it's old enough that I suppose we have to look at the colophon to see when it was printed.

20:31.329 --> 20:35.634
1556.

20:38.056 --> 20:39.958
And it's wonderful because it does have

20:40.293 --> 20:42.836
this Copernican quotation in the middle of it.

20:42.916 --> 21:09.709
You realize this is 13 years after Copernicus's book has come out, and Copernicus has enough of a reputation that the young student, they're discussing Copernicus, a man of great learning and of much experience and wonderful diligence and observation.

21:10.212 --> 21:12.855
hath renewed the opinion of Aristarchus Samnius.

21:12.895 --> 21:27.528
And then the young scholar says, Nay, sir, in good faith I desire not to hear such vain fantasies, so far against common reason and repugnant to the consent of all the learned multitude of writers, and therefore let it pass forever and a day longer.

21:28.189 --> 21:32.914
And the master says, You are too young to be a good judge in so great a manner.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.695
It passes far, your learning.

21:34.995 --> 21:35.416
Wow.

21:35.996 --> 21:38.739
You didn't know this when you bought it, did you?

21:38.759 --> 21:39.400
Oh, yeah, I do.

21:39.420 --> 21:39.780
I did.

21:40.064 --> 21:41.486
I knew what the book was.

21:41.546 --> 21:53.941
And you can see why the young man who came to look at it thought it was such a neat copy, because it is a wonderfully crisp copy and an old binding.

21:53.961 --> 21:56.664
It's slightly foxed, not even just a page.

21:56.684 --> 22:01.470
Just lacks those few pages out of the... Are they there in facsimile?

22:01.650 --> 22:03.372
No, no, it's just totally without.

22:04.073 --> 22:08.018
That's... And then you've got a quaritch, you said.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.020
Quaritch is...

22:10.237 --> 22:15.444
That was one of many books that Quaritches have helped me acquire.

22:16.025 --> 22:18.288
I'm very happy about booksellers.

22:19.009 --> 22:34.229
Good booksellers are very keen to help their customers build their collections, and as they understand your collection, they will go to some pains to point out things that you might want to buy.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.012
It helps them, and it helps you.

22:36.693 --> 22:39.096
So one day, Rick Watson at Quaritches...

22:39.295 --> 23:02.764
rang up to say that at the Bloomsbury auction, which I would probably not know about, there was coming up an unusual set of Michael Mestland's ephemerides, a very bad condition, sold subject, not subject to return, and that there was some problem about it being incomplete in the front matter.

23:03.685 --> 23:09.032
And he said that the estimated bid was very low, something like 50 pounds.

23:09.400 --> 23:16.126
And I said, look, I've been trying to get Mestland's Ephemerides for 15 years, and there's simply never been a copy on the market.

23:16.607 --> 23:20.310
So it's got to be worth more than that, even if it's in this tacky shape.

23:21.691 --> 23:25.315
So why don't you bid for it for me, and let's, you know, go 10 times higher.

23:26.275 --> 23:34.123
So they bid for it for me, and they, in fact, called up a couple days later to say they had got it.

23:34.183 --> 23:36.825
But they had bought it sight unseen because they hadn't gone...

23:37.075 --> 23:39.398
to check out the things in the auction beforehand.

23:39.939 --> 23:42.101
They said, yeah, it is pretty tatty at the beginning.

23:43.824 --> 23:47.769
But, well, first of all, let me show it to you.

23:47.789 --> 23:49.130
There it is.

23:49.150 --> 24:00.585
It's got this wonderful picture of Michael Mestland on the back, but it's also very instructive to show the students because you can actually see the teeth of the rodents as they worked around the face.

24:00.785 --> 24:02.748
Could you spell, I just wanted to get his name.

24:02.768 --> 24:06.893
It's M-A-E-S-T-L-I-N.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.956
He's the teacher of Johannes Kepler.

24:09.256 --> 24:15.064
So wherever these unbound pages were, they were where the rats could get at them.

24:15.484 --> 24:24.195
But the wonderful thing is that the, although the front matter is tattered and quite incomplete, the ephemerities themselves are here.

24:24.235 --> 24:25.677
Now what are ephemerities?

24:25.978 --> 24:29.743
Tables of positions of planets day by day.

24:29.803 --> 24:30.083
Mm-hmm.

24:31.582 --> 24:35.848
What is wonderful is that this is exactly as it was sold at the Frankfurt Book Fair.

24:36.169 --> 24:36.570
Wow.

24:36.990 --> 24:41.958
You see, totally uncut, unbound, even mostly unfolded.

24:42.298 --> 24:47.466
You can see here, for example, the little pinholes runs here, and the other is here.

24:47.506 --> 24:54.497
This went down on the press over those holes so that they could flip it and get the other side registered.

24:54.597 --> 24:55.358
It was never bound.

24:55.759 --> 24:59.344
So you can see how wonderful the registration is from back and front.

24:59.442 --> 25:02.966
But were they folded and—they were.

25:03.006 --> 25:04.808
Was it ever bound into a book?

25:04.828 --> 25:05.809
This has never been bound.

25:06.049 --> 25:10.835
This is still in the original sheets, just as it came from the book fair.

25:10.855 --> 25:12.817
Well, where do you think it had been all those years?

25:14.098 --> 25:15.740
It's probably been never read.

25:16.361 --> 25:21.026
Well, it's not only never been read, but they said— I mean, is that a fair assumption?

25:21.667 --> 25:23.649
Well, this particular copy has never been read.

25:23.749 --> 25:26.192
This is just sort of in bulk, the way it—

25:26.662 --> 25:27.523
the way it came.

25:27.603 --> 25:28.585
Maybe it was a remainder.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.566
Maybe it was ever sold.

25:29.847 --> 25:40.123
No, it was probably bought by a book dealer, but never had occasion either to sell it or to bind it, because they said there's something wrong with it, something else wrong with it.

25:40.183 --> 25:49.838
They said there's this letter here published in it from 1597, printed, 1596, and this is a book from 1580.

25:50.859 --> 25:52.602
So what's that doing in the front matter?

25:53.695 --> 25:58.400
It said, it's planetary, it's something, astronomical hypotheses.

25:59.021 --> 26:00.062
And I said, that's great.

26:00.263 --> 26:04.788
Mestland did a little university disputation on astronomical hypotheses.

26:04.848 --> 26:08.952
It was published in a small number of copies, very ephemeral.

26:08.993 --> 26:11.916
It's almost impossible to find this thing.

26:12.216 --> 26:15.600
I'm pleased you must have got my mistake, this thing.

26:16.521 --> 26:18.263
No, they said, we don't think it's that.

26:18.383 --> 26:19.905
It doesn't seem to be from Mestland.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.143
Anyway, they said, this letter looks like it's from Johannes Kepler.

26:23.163 --> 26:24.484
Now, who's they talking?

26:24.604 --> 26:26.566
This is Rick Watson from Quorage.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.087
It was he.

26:27.207 --> 26:31.010
He was telling me about this purchase for me.

26:32.051 --> 26:33.533
Kepler, I said, oh, no.

26:33.613 --> 26:35.275
I said, this just cannot be.

26:35.755 --> 26:46.886
But there is the letter of Kepler's that was published in something called Astronomical Hypotheses by Nicholas Ramirez Ursus, a man who got into a plagiarism battle with Tycho Brahe.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.048
And it was such a scurrilous pamphlet.

26:49.366 --> 26:59.761
that Tico had a court case against him and had all the copies burned, excepting just the few that happened to have been distributed before he had a chance to get at him.

27:00.763 --> 27:03.827
And lo and behold... And they said, why, I think that's it.

27:03.967 --> 27:06.371
Here is Ursus' name.

27:07.953 --> 27:08.033
Wow.

27:08.054 --> 27:10.277
So the first signature is not present.

27:10.798 --> 27:13.061
Otherwise, they would have known exactly what it was.

27:13.942 --> 27:17.247
But otherwise, here is a...

27:17.564 --> 27:21.890
an imperfect copy of this tract.

27:21.990 --> 27:24.513
Here's the letter from Kepler, for example.

27:25.434 --> 27:30.160
So it was everything that you had dreamed of and more.

27:30.180 --> 27:35.968
Well, this is one of the very few cases where one can accidentally buy a rare book.

27:35.988 --> 27:36.228
Wow.

27:36.608 --> 27:37.530
You see, there's the letter.

27:37.550 --> 27:38.251
1595.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.133
From Kepler.

27:41.014 --> 27:42.836
The name seems to be misspelled.

27:42.856 --> 27:44.078
It's magnificent.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.603
A paper is wonderful, isn't it?

27:46.743 --> 27:47.564
That's a nice rag.

27:47.964 --> 27:56.917
And Tico had his nose cut off in a duel, or part of his nose, and nobody ever knew for sure which part.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.180
But this book explains it.

28:00.983 --> 28:05.309
He says that he was having dinner with some friends, and this subject came up.

28:05.349 --> 28:12.419
He would not mention it himself, but that his friends were making jokes about it, that Tico did not need any instruments.

28:12.499 --> 28:14.622
All he had to do was to look up and cite

28:14.804 --> 28:16.867
through the nostrils of his nose.

28:17.288 --> 28:21.394
So apparently it was his bridge that was... Does this have a title, by the way?

28:23.597 --> 28:27.703
De Astronomisis Hypothesibus.

28:27.723 --> 28:36.756
A-S-T-R-O-N-O-M-I-C-I-S, that's de, D-E-H-Y-P-O-T-H-E-S-I-B, that's a U, but it looks like a U. U-S.

28:36.776 --> 28:43.005
And that was printed in... S-E-V, that's the system of the world.

28:43.188 --> 28:54.580
This is published in 1597, and here are the diagrams of the different systems of the world that were in doubt about this plagiarism.

28:54.740 --> 28:56.442
Do you suspect this is a unique copy?

28:56.662 --> 28:57.963
No, it's not a unique copy.

28:58.023 --> 29:08.254
I immediately telephoned to a colleague in Cambridge, England, who was making a translation of parts of this, and he said, my God, you must have got the third known copy.

29:08.895 --> 29:11.237
And I said, nope.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.093
It's a fourth unknown.

29:14.956 --> 29:16.818
I said it's not quite as rare as that.

29:17.159 --> 29:20.804
There are about two dozen copies now, and so it's not terribly rare.

29:20.824 --> 29:21.485
It's pretty rare.

29:21.706 --> 29:22.427
It's pretty rare.

29:22.507 --> 29:23.008
It's nice.

29:23.669 --> 29:30.759
Here is what was for many years the standard biography of Tycho Brahe, written by J. L. E. Dreyer.

29:32.321 --> 29:36.888
This happens to be Dreyer's own author's annotated copy of it.

29:36.908 --> 29:37.649
That's pretty nice.

29:37.669 --> 29:40.313
And you can see he's mentioning the book down here.

29:40.411 --> 29:45.919
And he indicates that it is so rare that he had not been able to see it when he was doing the biography.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.741
That makes you feel pretty good, doesn't it?

29:47.841 --> 29:53.850
And then he's written in a little footnote there saying that he now had seen a copy in the... And when was this written?

29:54.010 --> 29:54.751
This is 1890.

29:55.032 --> 29:59.157
These are the notes that he was making for the next 20 years in the book.

29:59.598 --> 30:07.449
He did this whole series of Kiko Brahe papers, and it's the standard edition after he did the biography.

30:07.809 --> 30:10.333
So what this is is all of the...

30:10.516 --> 30:18.805
correlations between the book and his big addition there.

30:19.146 --> 30:20.587
That's a great story.

30:20.627 --> 30:27.975
I'd better run, but I thought I would give you a little bit of a clue that I'm having a good time collecting books.

30:27.995 --> 30:33.942
Well, I think you're having a great time.
