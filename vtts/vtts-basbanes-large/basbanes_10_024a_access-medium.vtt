WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:06.082
Yeah, or you can hear it here, you know.

00:06.262 --> 00:09.126
But what I love is that you can go two hours.

00:09.707 --> 00:10.748
So we're recording now.

00:11.890 --> 00:13.011
Okay, well, what's Barry Moses?

00:14.313 --> 00:14.734
My library.

00:15.735 --> 00:15.935
I love it.

00:15.955 --> 00:17.517
Oh, I would just take a walk through it.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.301
Those are my books.

00:20.601 --> 00:21.903
That section there.

00:21.923 --> 00:22.844
My books, the books.

00:22.864 --> 00:24.867
The books that I've done in a lifetime.

00:25.688 --> 00:26.309
Do you have a number?

00:26.629 --> 00:27.410
Or is it a about number?

00:27.430 --> 00:27.831
Do you know?

00:27.851 --> 00:28.572
It's an about number.

00:28.652 --> 00:29.493
About 230.

00:30.054 --> 00:30.755
Wow.

00:30.835 --> 00:32.417
Now, that includes the books that I have.

00:32.954 --> 00:35.397
designed without illustrations.

00:35.497 --> 00:41.804
That includes books that have jackets that I've done illustrations for it, books that I've done just a frontispiece for.

00:43.947 --> 00:47.771
And it includes books that I've thoroughly illustrated.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.996
In other words, basically books that I've had a hand in.

00:52.016 --> 00:53.818
One way or the other.

00:53.838 --> 00:55.960
I like that.

00:55.980 --> 01:00.025
And these are my rare and fine first editions.

01:00.899 --> 01:01.840
Your collection?

01:01.860 --> 01:03.402
Yeah.

01:03.422 --> 01:04.964
Can you briefly describe it to me?

01:04.984 --> 01:05.484
The collection?

01:05.625 --> 01:07.307
It's very eclectic.

01:07.327 --> 01:08.968
An eclectic collection.

01:08.988 --> 01:10.690
Which I think in many ways is the best kind.

01:11.031 --> 01:12.453
I mean, it's just the things that interest me.

01:13.294 --> 01:16.237
A lot of these books are written by people who are friends of mine.

01:17.418 --> 01:24.326
There's some real good friends of mine, like Tracy Kidder and Bob Fagels and Mariani and so forth.

01:24.347 --> 01:26.409
But a lot of them are people that I have.

01:26.769 --> 01:29.032
Kay Gibbons, who's one of my best buddies.

01:29.052 --> 01:29.893
I love Kay.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.882
and Ann Patchett.

01:31.902 --> 01:32.543
You know how to work?

01:32.944 --> 01:33.985
Yeah, I like this one too.

01:34.165 --> 01:35.908
I like the last one too.

01:35.928 --> 01:40.174
I was just reading the other day the thing about heritage books.

01:42.056 --> 01:45.221
And then there's some rare books.

01:45.581 --> 01:55.375
There are, you know, Derrydale Press and there's this almost complete collection of Rockwell Kent and there are

01:55.692 --> 02:02.639
Other things, I have a first edition of the Robert Bridegroom that Eudora Welty signed to me and all that kind of stuff.

02:02.659 --> 02:04.220
I have a first edition of Huckleberry Finn.

02:04.481 --> 02:05.261
Oh, that's nice.

02:05.461 --> 02:07.483
Yeah, I got that stuff.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.285
But there's no focus.

02:10.586 --> 02:13.890
The only focus is that it interests me.

02:13.910 --> 02:14.350
There you go.

02:14.670 --> 02:17.113
Or that it's been done by friends of mine, people that I know.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.395
What are the dogs' names again?

02:19.595 --> 02:21.857
The big English Mastiff is Truman.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.759
English Mastiff, yeah.

02:23.799 --> 02:25.581
He's named after Harry S. Truman.

02:26.118 --> 02:28.882
The small English manuscript is Ike, named after Dwight.

02:28.902 --> 02:30.605
We go in presidential succession.

02:30.625 --> 02:34.751
We started with Woodrow Wilson, and then we had Roosevelt, and then D.J.

02:35.512 --> 02:38.897
And then, those are my only two dogs, the Roddy's Ball.

02:39.799 --> 02:41.101
So anyway, that's what that all is.

02:41.121 --> 02:44.105
And then down here, we begin doing other children's.

02:44.345 --> 02:47.090
Down here, my grandmother would sit on the floor and read.

02:48.011 --> 02:53.399
And then, unnatural history over here, being mythology and religion.

02:53.419 --> 02:55.382
My medical shelf, our shelves.

02:56.088 --> 03:01.496
I kind of sort of collect medical books that have photographs in them.

03:01.516 --> 03:02.037
Photographs?

03:02.598 --> 03:12.093
I'm not interested in medical illustration as such, but I am interested in photography of anomalies and all that sort of thing.

03:12.113 --> 03:12.734
What kind of wood?

03:13.415 --> 03:13.775
Cherry.

03:13.795 --> 03:14.256
Cherry.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.522
Yeah, it's all cherry.

03:18.542 --> 03:22.669
This is an Italian terracotta.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.812
It's not a terracotta.

03:25.231 --> 03:26.492
Looks like Terracotta to me.

03:26.532 --> 03:27.393
It looks like Terracotta.

03:28.374 --> 03:28.915
Yeah.

03:28.935 --> 03:35.843
Well, it used to be carpeted, but after 11 years and five dogs, the carpet came up.

03:36.644 --> 03:37.885
Plus the carpet in here.

03:37.905 --> 03:40.568
It's coming up for a long time.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.489
Did you build this house?

03:41.669 --> 03:42.350
I did.

03:42.370 --> 03:43.431
I designed it and built it.

03:43.471 --> 03:47.115
We built it in over the years, 86 and 87.

03:47.175 --> 03:49.418
You were probably working on it.

03:49.538 --> 03:51.580
I was in the process of designing it.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.842
Yeah, exactly.

03:52.862 --> 03:53.162
Yeah.

03:53.665 --> 03:54.145
This is funny.

03:54.165 --> 03:56.928
I remember doing a 180 turn, though, coming off the road.

03:56.948 --> 04:00.151
I don't know why I remember the 180 turn coming to your place.

04:00.931 --> 04:02.473
And if you need a bathroom, they're all right.

04:02.493 --> 04:02.793
Okay, great.

04:02.833 --> 04:03.113
Thanks.

04:03.193 --> 04:06.376
And then this is where things happen.

04:06.396 --> 04:08.118
Uh-huh.

04:08.138 --> 04:08.698
The kitchen.

04:12.441 --> 04:12.722
Nice.

04:14.163 --> 04:15.985
That's where the dogs, I'm going to put the dogs out.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.186
I was just going to do that.

04:17.786 --> 04:20.709
I'm going to put them out and put the fence around so they can't get in the door.

04:21.349 --> 04:21.670
Come on.

04:21.790 --> 04:22.170
Let's go, guys.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.285
Charlie will stay.

04:25.086 --> 04:35.879
Do you work frenetically?

04:35.939 --> 04:38.782
You say you get up at 4 o'clock in the morning?

04:38.802 --> 04:40.565
4 to 6, yeah.

04:40.585 --> 04:42.487
That's a good working time to you?

04:42.627 --> 04:43.148
It's the best.

04:45.130 --> 04:48.013
That time of the day, especially in wintertime, it's still dark out.

04:49.235 --> 04:51.077
I know the phone's not going to ring.

04:51.445 --> 04:55.991
And once the dogs are fed and got all the chores done, that's my time.

04:57.472 --> 05:08.225
Beyond that, I mean, starting at 9 o'clock in the morning, the phone starts ringing, the help arrives, you know, I've got things to tend to, I've got activities I have to oversee and all that kind of stuff.

05:08.245 --> 05:11.369
So the work gets a little bit jumbled after that.

05:11.830 --> 05:16.055
And then it's work as work can, you know.

05:16.435 --> 05:19.940
Steve, do you know pretty much what you're doing when you get up?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.081
I mean, you do...

05:21.162 --> 05:24.786
I had no, when I go to bed the night before, pretty much what I want to be doing the next day.

05:25.026 --> 05:25.967
I mean, do you structure it?

05:25.987 --> 05:37.780
I mean, you do engraving, you do illustrating, you do... No, yeah, it generally structures itself, the activities, and it depends on what I have to get done for, you know, to make the production schedule.

05:39.081 --> 05:47.490
But I found lately that I was amused by a story I read about...

05:50.795 --> 05:54.360
Morrison, the Nobel laureate, Ms.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.000
Morrison.

05:55.021 --> 05:55.802
Oh, it is Tony.

05:56.182 --> 05:56.643
Tony Morrison.

05:56.983 --> 05:57.644
She said that.

05:57.684 --> 06:06.275
She was saying in an interview one time that she didn't have any rituals, that there were no rituals that she owed to or anything.

06:06.295 --> 06:15.868
And further in the conversation with the interviewer, she said something about getting up every morning because she liked to welcome the day, liked to see the sun go up.

06:15.888 --> 06:16.689
That's not a ritual.

06:16.809 --> 06:17.730
Yeah, that's not a ritual.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.232
Sure, it's a ritual.

06:19.685 --> 06:26.171
But I've been noticing that, I mean, I certainly have always known I have rituals, but recently I've been noticing that the pattern.

06:27.272 --> 06:34.379
See, in your reading this journal, you're going to see things that I don't see, because I feel it's a day-by-day thing, rather than a document.

06:34.539 --> 06:38.283
One of these things, I'm going to sit down with it and actually look at it.

06:38.323 --> 06:39.845
Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures?

06:39.865 --> 06:41.987
Oh, no, no.

06:42.007 --> 06:47.532
But one of the things I'm noticing is that the first thing I do, after I get to my chore stuff, that's always the first thing,

06:48.406 --> 06:57.336
But after the chores are done, I spend generally an hour to an hour and a half reading and writing.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.741
Because I would read Newsweek every week from cover to cover, pretty much.

07:01.761 --> 07:03.943
That's sort of my... They saw that in the journal, though.

07:03.963 --> 07:05.325
Why Newsweek in particular?

07:05.866 --> 07:10.070
No particular reason, except that Newsweek in 1982 did a nice article about my Alice.

07:10.891 --> 07:11.872
So you're loyal.

07:11.972 --> 07:12.873
They were loyal, yes.

07:15.156 --> 07:16.978
Time magazine calls up and says...

07:17.161 --> 07:20.345
you know, would you get a subscription to Time Magazine?

07:20.385 --> 07:21.766
I said, no, I subscribed to Newsweek.

07:21.786 --> 07:23.328
And they said, well, why don't you subscribe to Time?

07:23.368 --> 07:24.869
I said, because Newweek's done two articles.

07:24.930 --> 07:26.171
I mean, Time's never done one.

07:26.371 --> 07:28.514
I said, and this guy who's calling you is a telemarketer.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.416
He doesn't have a clue.

07:30.476 --> 07:32.938
You figure you're another guy giving him a hard time, right?

07:32.958 --> 07:34.540
Yeah, but it shuts him up.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.501
Oh, okay.

07:37.563 --> 07:46.013
So I read the paper, and generally that's all done sitting on the property, you know, and that's my reading time.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.134
And then,

07:47.688 --> 07:49.790
I go in and I pull up the journal.

07:50.071 --> 07:51.793
I always write the journal the day after.

07:52.293 --> 07:56.698
It's a reflection on the day before, but I write it in the tenths of the day before.

07:58.019 --> 08:02.104
And that way I find that it cuts a lot of the chaff out.

08:02.905 --> 08:06.389
If I do it the day of, I put too many things in, I think sometimes.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.733
And then I answer my email, write letters.

08:10.153 --> 08:11.014
You like email, huh?

08:11.414 --> 08:11.755
I do.

08:11.895 --> 08:12.315
I can tell.

08:12.335 --> 08:12.996
I'm sorry.

08:13.016 --> 08:13.797
Because you're fast.

08:14.047 --> 08:17.993
Even the one I sent you last night, I do statuses.

08:18.173 --> 08:20.376
And you read that within eight minutes of it being sent.

08:20.396 --> 08:23.841
So I said, the little things I picked up, you know.

08:23.901 --> 08:24.342
I'm that way.

08:24.362 --> 08:27.426
I make at least three sweeps a day to see that.

08:27.466 --> 08:27.947
I love it.

08:27.987 --> 08:30.090
Well, I pay $19 for my service.

08:30.150 --> 08:32.093
It doesn't matter how long I stay on, it's the same amount of money.

08:32.253 --> 08:34.256
You know, my daughter, she's upstairs.

08:35.438 --> 08:36.739
Hers is $4 a month.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.282
She has to pay for every time she goes on.

08:38.362 --> 08:39.163
Oh, that's not so big.

08:39.183 --> 08:41.907
You know, and it's wonderful.

08:42.087 --> 08:42.608
It's there.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.429
It's in writing.

08:43.780 --> 08:47.826
You can choose to print it out or not, you know.

08:47.866 --> 08:48.547
That's very interesting.

08:48.567 --> 08:52.874
Here you are, a man of the book, and yet you certainly are adapting.

08:56.058 --> 08:57.380
What's the word I'm looking for?

08:57.400 --> 09:02.007
You seem to be making the transition without any... I resisted it.

09:02.027 --> 09:08.477
...to electronic... Five years ago, I would have said I'll never get involved with computers.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.762
I was not only a cyber-phobe, but a cyber-clasp.

09:11.995 --> 09:14.679
And I had nothing good to say about them.

09:15.660 --> 09:21.008
And then I started, you know, I just see what can be done in people writing, and I like to write.

09:21.028 --> 09:31.923
I mean, I really do like to write, but I've never written because, for me, writing is, as I have found out, writing is a process of revision and revision and revision and revision.

09:31.963 --> 09:39.353
And when you write calligraphically, revisions are a pain in the ass, especially if you, you know, it looks pretty

09:39.873 --> 09:40.954
It looks real nice down the page.

09:40.974 --> 09:43.116
You don't want to go scratching things out, you know.

09:43.136 --> 09:46.640
And then typing, I've never learned how to type properly.

09:47.521 --> 09:57.511
And I would be in a fit of inspiration or whatever, writing, and I'd hear the bell go off for the carriage return.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.693
Then I would, of course, ignore it.

09:59.813 --> 10:02.456
Figuring I'd get this one more word in there, but then I'd forget that I hadn't.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.578
And everything's going in that one spot, you know.

10:05.299 --> 10:08.682
And then you have a really great idea, but you've got to put another sheet of paper in.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.176
I love my manual.

10:11.256 --> 10:13.840
I have four or five manual typewriters.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.581
I love them.

10:14.601 --> 10:17.365
But you can type, and you've been doing that.

10:17.465 --> 10:18.667
It's part of your life.

10:19.187 --> 10:22.252
I'm actually terrific.

10:22.953 --> 10:26.137
Have you always kept a journal?

10:28.340 --> 10:33.187
No, I've kept a day book since the mid-70s.

10:33.928 --> 10:38.635
But the day book was just a, I did this today sort of thing.

10:38.817 --> 10:51.130
When I was doing The Wizard of Oz, I did a journal for about 45 days, which was a little bit more expanded than what I did in a day book.

10:51.791 --> 11:04.825
But when I started with the Bible, I decided that being inspired by Jean Cocteau's Diary of Making Beauty and the Beast, which I had my students read, those who will,

11:05.598 --> 11:15.851
And I loved his journal of that because he dealt with some of the poetic issues, some of the creative issues of making that film.

11:16.472 --> 11:25.383
But the thing that impressed me so much was his attention to, or his talking about the mundane things.

11:25.764 --> 11:29.108
The actor that gets a car buckle on his ass and can't sit in the saddle.

11:29.476 --> 11:35.286
the Luftwaffe flying over and having to shut the sound down, the failure of electricity, you know, all of these things.

11:35.867 --> 11:44.442
That really is what impresses me and why I want my students to read it is because this is what the life is about.

11:45.845 --> 11:53.037
It's that day-to-day stuff, and I just decided when I started this project that I would do a detailed journal.

11:54.097 --> 11:55.919
I mean, because it was the Bible.

11:56.060 --> 12:03.670
Yeah, I figured this is going to be the biggest thing I ever do, and I want a real good record of what I did.

12:04.411 --> 12:11.841
And a journal also serves as a legal document, especially if you've got a hard copy someplace that you can verify that the document you have in your computer hasn't been changed.

12:12.922 --> 12:17.448
You can't go in and say that you were someplace or did something.

12:17.689 --> 12:20.252
Like, I have my calendar.

12:20.553 --> 12:23.817
I can go back and change it.

12:24.252 --> 12:25.334
Well, and sometimes you do.

12:25.734 --> 12:25.914
Sure.

12:27.637 --> 12:30.021
You know, I go looking at my trip to Italy.

12:30.081 --> 12:32.184
Well, I went to a few places that I didn't have in there.

12:32.324 --> 12:33.886
And I certainly want you to put that back in.

12:33.906 --> 12:38.613
And I've got proof that I was at these places, but I sure want the calendar to indicate that I was there.

12:39.615 --> 12:41.818
Well, I do the same thing, but I have two copies.

12:41.838 --> 12:46.806
I have a copy of a journal that I feel perfectly free going in and changing around.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.488
But I also have the one that's pristine.

12:48.991 --> 12:54.318
And I copy that off about every month, every two months, and send it to Bruce Kovner, who's my partner.

12:55.120 --> 13:00.567
And so he had a hard copy of it, unedited.

13:01.829 --> 13:07.176
But that demonstrates, that documents the fact that... It documents everything, yeah, absolutely.

13:07.196 --> 13:12.824
When bills get paid, you know, what discussions I had with so-and-so and what we agreed to and so on.

13:12.844 --> 13:17.631
Now, of course, doing something like that, when you say, I had a discussion with so-and-so and we agreed to this, that is, of course,

13:18.033 --> 13:21.837
not a legally binding thing, it's just my recollection of the conversation.

13:22.437 --> 13:25.160
But at least it records my recollection of that conversation.

13:25.981 --> 13:38.854
Again, I haven't got a chance to read, obviously read the whole journal, but there's a Bible project that you have been always... Oh, Nick, I have wanted to do this thing for 30 years.

13:40.355 --> 13:48.023
It literally was that which came to me when I first started setting tight my hands.

13:48.813 --> 13:53.659
Which was in 1969, 68, 69.

13:54.960 --> 14:04.231
And the thing is that when you start studying typography and learning how to set the type and all that sort of thing, you're looking at the historic models.

14:04.251 --> 14:05.232
And what are the great models?

14:05.852 --> 14:06.974
The great models are Bibles.

14:08.676 --> 14:12.180
So I'm seeing the Bruce Rogers Bible, the World Bible.

14:12.260 --> 14:15.023
I'm seeing the Gutenbergs and the, you know, all of them.

14:15.043 --> 14:17.706
And then I'm thinking, wouldn't it be great to do this?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.984
And also to illustrate it.

14:21.004 --> 14:23.067
And so, yeah, it's been on my mind.

14:23.087 --> 14:39.530
In fact, I think it was 1977, March of 77, there was a symposium on illustration or on the book arts or something up at Leverett, the Leverett Arts and Crafts Center.

14:40.551 --> 14:48.402
And David Bourbeau, myself, Fritz Eikenberg, and I think there was a fourth person, I can't remember who it was.

14:48.922 --> 14:57.792
We're on this panel, and we were taking questions from the audience, and somebody said, addressed this question to all four of us.

14:57.872 --> 15:01.877
If you had any project that you'd like to do, what would it be?

15:02.558 --> 15:07.663
Eichenberg and I answered simultaneously and first, and both of us said the Bible.

15:09.365 --> 15:12.008
Yes, I've been wanting to do this for a very long time.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.431
Doing it at every level.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.515
It's not just doing the illustrations.

15:17.695 --> 15:17.815
Right.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.424
So this is really your Bible, I would say.

15:21.564 --> 15:21.884
It is.

15:22.585 --> 15:23.766
Well, mine in one sense.

15:23.806 --> 15:36.320
But then again, I was just writing this morning about the book art's more akin to theater and architecture and filmmaking than the art of painting or sculpture or performance art.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.724
Because it's all a matter of teamwork.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.746
I mean, I can't do this thing by myself.

15:42.086 --> 15:44.629
I can do certain aspects of it by myself, but I certainly can't.

15:45.352 --> 15:51.901
do the whole of it, because I'm not a paper maker, I'm not a typographer, I'm not a punch cutter or a type designer, all that sort of thing.

15:51.921 --> 15:53.283
It depends on so many people.

15:54.305 --> 15:58.470
And the least of all of that is not someone to pay the bill.

16:00.694 --> 16:05.180
In fact, it's one of the reasons I think the thing hasn't been done before, because it's too bloody expensive.

16:05.781 --> 16:08.044
It's costing $2 million to do this project.

16:10.047 --> 16:13.131
We've already spent 1.73 minutes.

16:14.900 --> 16:20.687
So you figure, I mean, just the bindings alone are nearly $2,000 a book.

16:21.788 --> 16:23.711
Why don't you describe some of these?

16:23.751 --> 16:26.895
Well, I was hoping I'd have one here today, but it wasn't finished.

16:27.275 --> 16:29.358
And I was going to drive down to East Hampton and bring it up.

16:29.378 --> 16:39.490
This is just the New Testament, but the binding of the finished Bible is going to be similar to this, except instead of the handmade paper over Lent boards.

16:39.892 --> 16:40.894
It's full vellum.

16:40.914 --> 16:41.815
Over what kind of boards?

16:41.835 --> 16:42.997
Over thin boards.

16:43.638 --> 16:45.041
What kind of words do you use?

16:45.361 --> 16:45.722
Limp.

16:45.802 --> 16:46.543
Limp.

16:46.563 --> 16:48.166
Just so I don't have to label over that.

16:48.186 --> 16:49.168
L-I-N-P, limp.

16:49.528 --> 16:54.717
Yeah, limp vellum, which is an ancient means or way of binding books.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.060
There's no glue in it anywhere.

16:56.761 --> 17:00.988
It's a complete non-adhesive binding.

17:01.576 --> 17:05.963
So, I mean, it's a little more finished than this, but... But this is vellum?

17:05.983 --> 17:06.704
This is genuine?

17:06.764 --> 17:07.786
No, this is paper.

17:07.846 --> 17:08.988
This is handmade paper.

17:09.048 --> 17:11.792
And the finished product is genuine vellum.

17:11.812 --> 17:13.975
We have to kill two goats for every Bible.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.177
That's the way it is.

17:15.197 --> 17:15.738
I'm sorry about that.

17:15.758 --> 17:16.599
You know what you're going to do?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.943
There's sort of a...

17:19.261 --> 17:21.024
There's something biblical about that anyway.

17:21.044 --> 17:24.671
If there's any translation, I think it took 250 for each Gutenberg Bible.

17:25.773 --> 17:26.494
Exactly.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.598
Are you amazed that I know that?

17:29.359 --> 17:30.321
No, I'm not at all.

17:31.062 --> 17:32.545
I'm amazed.

17:32.565 --> 17:35.851
They used to refer to prayer books and Bibles in terms of flocks.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.636
This is a two-flock Bible or this is a three-flock Bible.

17:38.656 --> 17:39.377
Where did I get that?

17:39.397 --> 17:43.665
I don't know where I came up with that.

17:44.371 --> 17:50.360
Well, it is a detail that somebody gave me, and I don't know where it came from, but I don't make things like that up.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.423
I'm not smart enough to make a thing like that up.

17:52.544 --> 17:53.425
I might just quote you why.

17:53.746 --> 17:57.351
Yeah, but I mean, it's like, how many flocks of goats are we going to have to kill to do this thing?

17:57.371 --> 18:00.396
I don't know how many goats comprise a flock, you know?

18:01.598 --> 18:04.242
Maybe there are 30 goats to a flock.

18:04.262 --> 18:05.704
I don't know.

18:06.173 --> 18:09.338
But this is going to be a mini flock binding.

18:09.358 --> 18:11.200
So are all the engravings done?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.824
It will be done by next week, I think, or a week after.

18:13.864 --> 18:14.946
I guess six more to do.

18:15.266 --> 18:15.727
Five more.

18:15.747 --> 18:18.330
Can you show me at some point, show me a little bit what you do?

18:18.350 --> 18:19.472
Almost all of them.

18:19.492 --> 18:21.094
Oh, yeah, I can show you exactly what I'm doing.

18:21.114 --> 18:31.089
That would be nice if we could have a little... I'm engraving... Today I started engraving... I finished this morning, mid-morning.

18:31.129 --> 18:35.455
I finished an engraving I started the day before yesterday, which was Moses and his sepulcher.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.741
which is the next to the last or last image of the Pentateuch.

18:40.001 --> 18:48.393
And then I picked up right after that, within 45 minutes, I picked up the next block that I wanted to do, which is the coming storm, the coming deluge.

18:50.156 --> 18:55.363
Not Noah, but Noah and Noah's two sons and two cats on board here.

18:55.383 --> 18:59.048
Do you know the word cat does not appear in the Bible anywhere?

18:59.569 --> 18:59.930
No.

18:59.950 --> 19:00.571
It's not there.

19:01.071 --> 19:03.535
And I did a book a few years ago.

19:03.635 --> 19:04.757
What's the word in existence?

19:04.777 --> 19:05.097
Do you know?

19:05.117 --> 19:05.678
Do we know?

19:06.063 --> 19:08.026
Yeah, it just doesn't appear.

19:08.346 --> 19:11.431
A lion appears, and a dog appears, and all that stuff.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.914
But the word cat does not appear in the English Bible.

19:15.156 --> 19:31.058
So that little fact, coupled up with my having done a number of years ago a children's book called Noah's Cats and the Devil's Fire, which is a—I've forgotten what the nationality is, but it's an Eastern European origin.

19:31.848 --> 19:43.966
And it's a legend that the devil got on board the ark in the form of a mouse, in the form of a rat, and the two cats basically kick his ass off.

19:45.268 --> 19:53.801
But in so doing, the devil retains and invades the cat's spirit in some ways, and it makes their eyes sparkle, and that's why their eyes glow at night.

19:53.881 --> 19:55.042
That's great.

19:55.363 --> 19:56.545
Yeah, it's a very nice look.

19:56.565 --> 20:00.150
You're choosing, you're making the decision on what scenes to illustrate?

20:00.637 --> 20:02.058
How are you doing that?

20:03.380 --> 20:08.585
Is it more or less the way the text is progressing and we need an illustration here?

20:08.605 --> 20:09.426
That's exactly right.

20:09.546 --> 20:10.727
It's spatial more than anything.

20:10.827 --> 20:11.088
Really?

20:11.188 --> 20:11.368
Yeah.

20:11.969 --> 20:15.512
When I did it, well, it's a long time ago now, it seems.

20:15.532 --> 20:17.174
It would have been three years ago.

20:17.995 --> 20:22.800
I bought the largest paperback Bible I could find.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.642
It happened to be a new translation at that time.

20:25.943 --> 20:30.087
I had previously gone through...

20:31.045 --> 20:44.342
I don't know how many monographs on the work of Rembrandt, Mantegna, Velazquez, you know, all of my favorites, the Dores even, and made up lists of illustrations of things that interest me.

20:45.203 --> 20:56.998
Now, if it were something that didn't interest me, I didn't make a note of it, but I made up this list and then I would see where Rembrandt did the same thing, Potiphar's wife, and then you would see another image of Potiphar's wife and then another one.

20:57.018 --> 20:59.922
So I think, hmm, that's probably something that I should investigate.

21:00.408 --> 21:11.544
So I made up, from that I deduced, or derived, I derived a final list of illustrations, which is, I think, about 300 potential images long.

21:11.564 --> 21:12.305
300?

21:12.505 --> 21:12.846
About 300.

21:13.246 --> 21:14.749
For both the new and the old?

21:15.089 --> 21:16.391
New and old, yeah.

21:16.411 --> 21:17.332
150 each, about 100.

21:18.634 --> 21:22.780
Well, the New Testament's only a fifth of the whole.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.006
So the New Testament has, I think, 57 or 58 images in it.

21:27.239 --> 21:30.482
And then each one of the other four sections has roughly 50.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.044
So again, so you're reading the Bible.

21:32.184 --> 21:33.626
Have you had to reread the whole Bible?

21:33.646 --> 21:36.829
I haven't reread the whole thing, no, but I have certainly reread a lot of the sections.

21:36.849 --> 21:39.812
And of course, there are some parts of it that I've read over and over and over.

21:39.852 --> 21:42.275
Ecclesiastes, Proverbs.

21:42.295 --> 21:45.258
And how do you pick a scene beyond the spatial element?

21:45.958 --> 21:48.821
Well, see, let me finish this other thing.

21:48.841 --> 21:54.327
So I took that list of illustrations, and I took this newly bought paperback Bible,

21:54.509 --> 22:07.034
I put a sticky, a yellow sticky, so that it protruded in front of the fore edge of the book by about a quarter of an inch and staggered them so they'd be like tabs in a loose-leaf binder.

22:07.875 --> 22:11.322
Then I just took that Bible and studied the edge of it.

22:11.863 --> 22:16.753
That way I could see where it needed something and where it was all jammed up.

22:17.003 --> 22:22.770
is totally jammed up, because you've got some of the greatest stories in Genesis, I mean, from the... I don't know what you mean, where it was jammed up in Genesis.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.153
There were 15 illustrations in five pages.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.736
Too many stickies in that area.

22:27.756 --> 22:31.460
But in other areas, like, say, for instance, Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, there were none.

22:32.281 --> 22:37.067
Because Rembrandt didn't do illustrations for Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, the Psalms, the Song of Psalms.

22:37.748 --> 22:38.148
Or Job.

22:38.308 --> 22:39.670
I think he made them joke.

22:40.156 --> 22:43.621
Doré did some things for Joe, but he didn't do any for the other books of the poetry.

22:43.942 --> 22:45.584
And the books of poetry were left wanting.

22:45.805 --> 22:53.136
So then I had to go back through and pull stickies out where there were too many, where it was too compact with illustrations.

22:53.817 --> 22:56.121
And then go in where it was too lean.

22:57.203 --> 22:57.824
I'll put it that way.

22:58.525 --> 23:01.389
Go into the places where it was too fat with illustrations and take things out.

23:01.890 --> 23:08.340
And then go into places where the stickies told me that my scheme, my plan was too lean and put stickies in.

23:08.624 --> 23:11.227
And where I had to put stickies in is where I really had to do the reading.

23:12.288 --> 23:14.450
You know, I really had to find out what was going on there.

23:15.071 --> 23:15.251
Yes?

23:15.291 --> 23:21.497
I should have had that on the table.

23:22.018 --> 23:23.800
The American Bible Society Auditor.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.261
Yeah.

23:25.281 --> 23:26.463
And what are these retailing for?

23:26.683 --> 23:27.203
Ten grand.

23:27.884 --> 23:28.204
How many?

23:28.725 --> 23:29.185
Four hundred.

23:30.727 --> 23:32.549
So they're also getting Andrews.

23:32.569 --> 23:34.251
I don't care if they get Andrews nor they get mine.

23:35.492 --> 23:36.994
How many are subscribed at this point?

23:37.134 --> 23:38.395
At this point, what do we have?

23:38.628 --> 23:39.349
Four or four?

23:39.629 --> 23:41.051
Fifty?

23:42.132 --> 23:43.013
That we have.

23:43.033 --> 23:45.236
And we're only going to sell a hundred copies ourselves.

23:46.137 --> 23:48.099
Heritage is going to sell the other three hundred.

23:49.521 --> 23:50.322
That's why you were reading.

23:50.582 --> 23:51.744
That's why I was reading.

23:51.784 --> 23:51.964
Heritage.

23:51.984 --> 23:53.005
Yeah, yeah.

23:53.025 --> 23:56.449
But I remembered when I read the book, when did it come out, two years ago?

23:56.930 --> 23:57.511
Boy, is it.

23:57.531 --> 23:59.052
Oh, shit, don't tell me that.

23:59.974 --> 24:01.275
Oh, God.

24:01.295 --> 24:01.936
What did it win?

24:02.697 --> 24:03.718
You up for the Pulitzer?

24:03.838 --> 24:04.599
No, thank you.

24:04.619 --> 24:05.120
National?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.022
I was a finalist for the National Book Critics.

24:07.102 --> 24:07.943
Okay, all right.

24:08.311 --> 24:09.272
Which is not bad.

24:09.312 --> 24:10.434
I'd say not.

24:11.455 --> 24:13.958
I was trying to remember that the other day and I couldn't.

24:14.599 --> 24:15.400
Four years ago.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.281
Yeah, 95.

24:16.961 --> 24:19.204
And it's been selling very well.

24:21.387 --> 24:28.195
I've never seen it before, but I've argued that other people have done it long before me.

24:28.475 --> 24:29.897
In the form of a self-interview.

24:31.278 --> 24:33.800
and where I have a queue.

24:34.301 --> 24:35.362
They have that in the journal.

24:35.382 --> 24:35.902
I've seen that.

24:35.923 --> 24:36.623
Yeah.

24:37.344 --> 24:42.129
It's just a more interesting way for me to write about things than a simple academic discourse.

24:42.449 --> 24:43.850
So you're responding to questions.

24:43.870 --> 24:43.970
Yeah.

24:44.110 --> 24:47.113
So I pretend I'm two people and I realize it's my image.

24:47.133 --> 24:52.298
So Mariani wrote the introduction for the same image and he's talking about the—because that's all they did.

24:52.318 --> 24:57.303
They did my self-interviews about the crucifixion.

24:57.323 --> 25:01.167
And so Mariani had deduced that the muse is a big black woman.

25:01.720 --> 25:08.006
And I don't know where the hell he got that, but I had figured out a long time ago it was a woman.

25:08.026 --> 25:11.169
But he figures it was a black woman I knew when I was a kid.

25:11.810 --> 25:12.811
And I dearly loved her.

25:12.831 --> 25:14.413
So this started in 95, I guess.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.675
Yeah, August 25, 1995.

25:16.755 --> 25:21.940
And I pit into that date because it was that date that Bruce Covner called me and said he'd finance it.

25:21.960 --> 25:26.565
So the big stumbling block then was the money.

25:28.006 --> 25:29.027
Basically there were...

25:30.087 --> 25:31.208
three stumbling blocks.

25:31.228 --> 25:35.953
The first stumbling block was money, just to be able to do it.

25:35.973 --> 25:43.081
I used the term today that I was writing in the journal, architectural economics we're talking about.

25:43.101 --> 25:46.985
Because you can build buildings for the kind of money we're talking about.

25:47.005 --> 25:47.826
That's for sure.

25:49.207 --> 25:50.228
That's the first stumbling block.

25:50.248 --> 25:59.318
The second stumbling block was that, and I think that I'm the culprit in this, but there aren't any engraving blocks in the market, wood engraving blocks.

25:59.838 --> 26:08.016
The last blocks that I bought were so bad that they looked beautiful to the feel, to the touch, but boy, when you start cutting, they were awful.

26:08.978 --> 26:14.009
And they're frankly expensive, something like 20 pounds a square inch or something like that.

26:14.069 --> 26:15.552
I mean, it's like, phew.

26:15.785 --> 26:17.527
But these last indefinitely, right?

26:17.648 --> 26:21.253
Yeah, but still and all, the wood isn't good.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.695
It can't get to the size I need.

26:23.135 --> 26:26.380
Is it also that people don't know that this is a lost art?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.244
Do you think this is a dying art?

26:29.264 --> 26:29.965
Yes and no.

26:30.606 --> 26:45.707
I think that the quality of the materials has diminished, but I think it's also that people who start cutting this wood, who learn on this wood, won't notice.

26:45.839 --> 26:47.862
You know, they'll fall right into it.

26:48.042 --> 26:55.012
But if you know the good stuff and then you come to the second, you know, lower grade stuff, it's too much of a shock.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.634
So what did you learn on it?

26:56.774 --> 26:58.456
I learned really good boxwood.

26:58.476 --> 26:59.898
You know, really good boxwood.

26:59.918 --> 27:07.008
And so now, I mean, I'd rather cut maple than the kind of boxwood I've been, than the last boxwood that I bought.

27:07.028 --> 27:08.230
And where have you been getting this boxwood?

27:08.250 --> 27:08.570
England.

27:09.631 --> 27:09.792
England.

27:09.812 --> 27:09.912
Yeah.

27:09.932 --> 27:10.973
And at the best sources.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.737
So anyway,

27:14.425 --> 27:15.927
discovered through Kim Marker.

27:15.947 --> 27:17.769
You know Kim Marker at the University of Iowa?

27:17.869 --> 27:19.511
Yeah.

27:19.631 --> 27:30.923
His is the Stonewall Press and, Jesus, you'll have to memo me on this one.

27:33.086 --> 27:39.673
He's one of the great printers in America, and he's pretty much responsible for the Center for the Book at the University of Iowa.

27:40.801 --> 27:47.047
And he had sent me a tiny little piece of this plastic stuff with a note saying, I understand you can engrave this stuff.

27:47.087 --> 27:49.770
I looked at it and I said, horse shit, that's plastic, you can't do that.

27:49.890 --> 28:00.001
And I carried this little gray piece of plastic around with me when I'd go around doing talks and people would inevitably ask, why aren't you engraving anymore?

28:00.021 --> 28:01.022
Well, there's no wood.

28:01.122 --> 28:02.643
Well, isn't there something else you can use?

28:03.584 --> 28:06.387
Reach down in the pocket and pull this little piece of stuff out and say, yeah,

28:06.721 --> 28:10.805
Ken Merker tells me I can engrave on this stuff, but it's plastic, and that's crap, and I won't do it.

28:11.146 --> 28:14.429
And so I said, that was three or four or five years I did that.

28:15.150 --> 28:19.554
And I was out in Pasadena at the Art Center School doing a workshop.

28:19.795 --> 28:30.886
Same situation exactly, except this time when I answered the question, I had an engraving tool in my hand, and I went, cut across the surface of this stuff.

28:31.527 --> 28:32.328
It was so sweet.

28:33.369 --> 28:34.450
Oh, it was so sweet.

28:34.919 --> 28:35.980
You hadn't tried it before.

28:36.020 --> 28:36.561
Never tried it.

28:36.661 --> 28:37.542
It just looked ugly.

28:38.382 --> 28:40.204
And it was awful gray kind of stuff.

28:40.224 --> 28:41.445
It looked like... So what happened?

28:41.986 --> 28:44.668
You were actually trying to demonstrate how lousy it was, and you did it.

28:44.749 --> 28:46.230
And so what did you say?

28:46.250 --> 28:51.355
And I said, you guys hold on a minute.

28:51.695 --> 28:52.776
I'll be right back to you here.

28:52.796 --> 28:53.557
Hold on just a sec.

28:54.018 --> 28:56.760
And I made five or six more cuts to make sure I wasn't imagining it.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.121
And I said, holy mother.

28:59.022 --> 29:00.724
So I made a little drawing on the block.

29:00.940 --> 29:05.510
and actually did some engraving, drew a little dog's head or something, and I started doing something.

29:05.531 --> 29:06.934
Man, it held that line nicely.

29:07.756 --> 29:09.500
So I got in touch with the guy and invented it.

29:09.961 --> 29:10.963
Now, imagine this.

29:10.983 --> 29:15.594
This guy has a wonderfully double ironic name, or a name of a double irony.

29:15.934 --> 29:19.663
His name is Richard Woodman, and he lives in Redwood City, California.

29:19.783 --> 29:20.164
That's great.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.990
He's an Englishman who was an engineer.

29:23.070 --> 29:28.397
He retired a number of years ago and decided in his retirement he was going to go back to his childhood hobby, which was wood engraving.

29:28.417 --> 29:31.741
And he found out what we already know, which is there than any wood.

29:32.081 --> 29:34.624
But being a chemical engineer, he decided to invent a substitute.

29:35.305 --> 29:37.208
So he invented this stuff called Resingrave.

29:37.428 --> 29:38.489
What do you call it?

29:38.509 --> 29:39.671
Resingrave?

29:39.731 --> 29:40.512
Resingrave.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.654
R-E-S-I-N-G-R-A-V-E.

29:42.975 --> 29:44.977
It's a cast polymer resin.

29:44.997 --> 29:48.121
That must be a capital I. There must be a zero on the swing.

29:48.141 --> 29:48.822
Exactly.

29:48.842 --> 29:50.404
Yeah.

29:50.587 --> 29:54.992
Specifically for artists like yourself.

29:55.152 --> 29:55.893
Yeah, exactly.

29:56.093 --> 29:57.915
But nobody would bite on the stuff much.

29:58.135 --> 29:59.117
It was a hard sell.

29:59.657 --> 30:07.706
Rembrandt Graphics was carrying it, but he insisted on toning the surface of this block with some sort of an Indian ink wash.

30:08.487 --> 30:09.588
So I called him up and talked to him.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.852
I said, hey, listen, could you make some blocks for me, but don't tone them?

30:12.872 --> 30:14.153
Can you leave the material white?

30:14.814 --> 30:15.615
And he said, sure.

30:16.439 --> 30:27.032
So he started making these things for me, and we've gone back and forth on, you know, trying to get them manufactured a little flatter and type high and all that sort of thing.

30:27.052 --> 30:31.697
It's not perfect, but man, I tell you, it sure made this project possible.

30:31.717 --> 30:33.019
So you used these blocks for this?

30:33.039 --> 30:33.379
Yeah, absolutely.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.360
So these aren't wood blocks?

30:34.380 --> 30:35.141
These aren't wooden engravings.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.624
Now these are, oh, sorry, that was the book opening.

30:38.225 --> 30:39.466
These are done on plastic.

30:39.707 --> 30:45.113
I mean, and there's nobody, Nick, there's absolutely nobody can tell the difference between this and the wood engraving.

30:45.447 --> 30:46.829
I mean, I couldn't tell the difference.

30:47.309 --> 30:49.472
What would they look for to say it's not a win-win?

30:49.692 --> 30:52.536
The edges of the white lines would scallop.

30:52.836 --> 30:55.519
They would be fuzzy instead of really clean.

30:55.980 --> 31:00.805
But if the tools are properly sharp, it doesn't leave that scalloped edge.

31:01.186 --> 31:02.107
It's marked.

31:02.648 --> 31:06.472
The other thing is that with the... Hey, Dan.

31:06.512 --> 31:07.313
Dan, this is Nick.

31:07.353 --> 31:08.655
Nick, this is Dan.

31:08.675 --> 31:09.676
Hey, Nick.

31:09.696 --> 31:11.138
How you doing?

31:11.158 --> 31:13.060
There are no images that have any big white areas.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.403
I have not cut any white out of anything.

31:15.788 --> 31:19.692
They're all, because what happens is you have to use a router to cut the big areas out.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.815
How do you spell that, router?

31:22.155 --> 31:23.517
R-O-U-T-E-R.

31:23.537 --> 31:24.318
That's what it says.

31:24.338 --> 31:26.460
It has a Dremel, high speed router.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.202
And it kicks up a stench.

31:28.683 --> 31:30.405
This stuff really smells bad when it gets hot.

31:30.905 --> 31:33.328
So I don't like the smell of it, so I decided I'm not going to.

31:33.348 --> 31:34.469
So you're not using wood anymore?

31:34.790 --> 31:36.912
I'm not using wood anymore.

31:37.072 --> 31:38.274
That's a huge thing, right?

31:38.294 --> 31:39.235
It's a huge thing.

31:39.255 --> 31:41.097
And this is the first major book.

31:41.157 --> 31:45.762
I've done two other books with this material, but they were books for children, sort of as experiments.

31:46.130 --> 31:52.197
and seeing how well it would work, and also seeing if it would hold up under the pressure of printing press for a long run.

31:53.138 --> 31:56.161
And I've got to tell you, it doesn't check, it doesn't work, it's cheap.

31:56.842 --> 31:58.504
I mean, one of these blocks is like $25.

31:58.664 --> 32:02.188
I mean, a big one is like $25.

32:03.389 --> 32:08.114
And, I mean, the whole bill for the Bible and engraving blocks is probably $3,000.

32:08.254 --> 32:15.462
And if I had done wood, oh my God, I mean, it would have been...

32:15.644 --> 32:17.447
$30,000, $40,000.

32:17.787 --> 32:22.234
Do these blocks have a projected lifespan per engraving?

32:22.494 --> 32:24.317
I mean, they can't go indefinitely, can they?

32:24.357 --> 32:25.459
As far as I know, they can.

32:25.699 --> 32:27.662
I don't know why they wouldn't.

32:27.702 --> 32:35.954
The only thing is that the material is cast on medium density particle board.

32:37.316 --> 32:41.382
It's the stuff you use for flooring, subflooring.

32:41.986 --> 32:43.267
There are several grades of it.

32:43.468 --> 32:45.090
Some is really rough and some is really fine.

32:45.110 --> 32:48.373
So he uses the really fine, extra dense stuff.

32:48.393 --> 32:58.325
And unless that particle board were to deteriorate somehow, there's absolutely no reason in the world why these couldn't go on indefinitely, just like a wood engrave.

32:58.725 --> 33:02.690
But now, after you do the run, what happens to the blocks?

33:02.710 --> 33:10.339
The blocks then come here to be stored until we finish the project, because we're going to have to go back on press for a couple of forms.

33:10.707 --> 33:12.048
You understand how that works.

33:12.088 --> 33:20.496
You collate, you print so many sheets, you collate, well, you didn't see a boo-boo on this form, so your five sheets is short, you know, so you've got to go back on press.

33:20.937 --> 33:23.019
So until we have everything done, the blocks are here.

33:23.179 --> 33:34.830
Once the project is done and finished, we're going to select at least 30 of the blocks, and maybe more, which are one each for 30 deluxe copies of it.

33:34.850 --> 33:37.913
And it's going to say that the deluxe copy will be bound in five volumes.

33:38.365 --> 33:46.536
And each volume will be in a box, and then there'll be a sixth box that has either one or two engraving blocks in it, and then a suite of the prints and another box.

33:46.576 --> 33:49.620
So the deluxe Bible is going to be like 10 boxes.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.784
And that will, as opposed to the 10,000, that'll be what?

33:52.804 --> 33:54.166
25,000, 30,000, 35,000.

33:54.246 --> 33:54.987
How many of those?

33:55.007 --> 33:56.008
No, 30 of them.

33:57.630 --> 33:58.051
So it's 430.

33:58.131 --> 34:07.984
Actually, the print run itself is more than that, but that's what we're going to combine and issue, yes, in 130.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.832
And, of course, you go into this without knowing that you've sold any.

34:12.113 --> 34:12.773
That's right.

34:12.854 --> 34:13.935
It is a crapshoot, basically.

34:13.955 --> 34:14.356
It is a crapshoot.

34:14.376 --> 34:25.991
I mean, it's Barry Mosier, so we certainly know that you have this extraordinary international reputation, but nevertheless, it's still all upfront money without any guarantee of return, right?

34:26.011 --> 34:26.411
Absolutely.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.595
So you do kind of have squeaky jowls that sell books.

34:29.616 --> 34:30.056
Exactly.

34:30.136 --> 34:38.427
And that's why having one man who has an extraordinary collection of books himself as a bibliophile of the first order,

34:38.812 --> 34:42.456
who loves to do this.

34:42.917 --> 34:53.529
And he even said to me one time, he said, you know, because I was saying about one of the reasons why I stopped doing this, we nearly went bankrupt doing Oz and Huck and all that.

34:53.549 --> 34:56.733
And he said, well, believe me, there's no chance of our doing that here.

34:56.773 --> 34:59.056
There's no chance of doing what?

34:59.336 --> 35:00.117
Going bankrupt.

35:00.938 --> 35:04.963
I mean, you used to do this yourself, is what you're telling me.

35:04.983 --> 35:07.806
Yeah, with limited partnerships and borrowing money and all kinds of things.

35:08.377 --> 35:09.398
No, it's his money.

35:10.079 --> 35:12.222
And we're partners, 50-50 partnership.

35:12.242 --> 35:12.903
He's smiling.

35:12.943 --> 35:15.026
But the rest of the tape shows very smiling.

35:15.186 --> 35:17.109
It's wonderful.

35:17.329 --> 35:22.235
I feel today, I think, what artists in the Renaissance must have felt like when they had a patron.

35:23.197 --> 35:24.679
You know, I get a salary every month.

35:25.500 --> 35:25.740
Really?

35:25.980 --> 35:29.745
Yeah, I get a salary every month that I work on this thing.

35:29.765 --> 35:32.429
And I don't get benefits, but that's okay.

35:32.449 --> 35:34.712
The salary's big enough to cover my pennies.

35:35.593 --> 35:36.274
And...

35:37.452 --> 35:39.855
If I need something, it's in the budget.

35:40.295 --> 35:43.279
I just, you know, I just order it.

35:43.499 --> 35:48.986
I mean, regardless of what the return might be, he has to be doing this for the love of the project.

35:49.006 --> 35:52.410
I mean, a guy at that level can't be doing this to make... Right, it's not to make money.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.331
It's not to make money.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.532
And this is an interesting thing.

35:54.552 --> 36:01.120
When we sold the trade rights to Viking, Viking Studios bringing this out as a $65 book next fall.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.301
This forthcoming fall?

36:02.321 --> 36:05.265
Yeah, we're simultaneously... I'll have to get it for my Christmas friend.

36:05.766 --> 36:06.466
I'll get you one.

36:06.486 --> 36:06.987
I'll get you one.

36:07.574 --> 36:09.577
Me too, of course.

36:09.958 --> 36:21.557
But when they offered us money, I was—and they and other publishers, too, because we were doing a bid thing, an auction.

36:21.577 --> 36:24.181
And I was insulted at the first offers to come in.

36:24.922 --> 36:30.231
And then I wasn't any too happy when the final offers came in.

36:30.371 --> 36:31.713
Was it an auction, though?

36:31.793 --> 36:32.595
Yeah, it was an auction.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.678
The auction started at $50,000.

36:35.384 --> 36:40.252
And I think $50,000, Christ almighty, I get that illustrating a children's book with 32 pictures in it.

36:40.272 --> 36:41.233
I mean, come on, you know?

36:42.375 --> 36:47.804
And, well, the price went up from there, but, and I'm seriously getting depressed about this.

36:47.824 --> 36:48.966
I called David Godin.

36:48.986 --> 36:49.667
Depressed or pissed?

36:49.927 --> 36:50.168
Both.

36:50.188 --> 36:51.810
Both combination there.

36:52.491 --> 36:58.821
And I called David Godin, because David, we've been friends from, you know, back at the old student days.

37:00.324 --> 37:02.307
And so I called him, because he wasn't a player.

37:02.367 --> 37:03.028
I said, hey, David,

37:03.498 --> 37:03.999
Am I?

37:04.079 --> 37:04.859
What's going on here?

37:04.960 --> 37:12.228
I mean, am I off base, you know, feeling like I'm being insulted here since Paulo Barberi got $3 million for a tell-all book about O.J.

37:12.248 --> 37:12.668
Simpson?

37:13.589 --> 37:15.151
Because it's got to be worth more than that.

37:15.571 --> 37:18.534
And he said, well, let me have the numbers.

37:18.574 --> 37:19.435
I gave him the numbers.

37:19.696 --> 37:20.457
I mean, they published it.

37:20.477 --> 37:21.097
I told him.

37:21.117 --> 37:23.460
He said, actually, Barry, that's a very nice offer.

37:24.020 --> 37:25.722
What was the effort?

37:25.762 --> 37:26.183
$150,000.

37:26.723 --> 37:32.830
And it was, and their first round is going to be, I've got another $25,000.

37:33.113 --> 37:34.255
I think in the first run or something like that.

37:34.275 --> 37:35.096
Well, that's pretty good.

37:35.537 --> 37:36.919
Yeah, I mean, it is.

37:37.039 --> 37:38.200
It's a $65 book, too.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.002
Right, exactly.

37:39.142 --> 37:41.666
So you run the numbers out, which I hadn't done.

37:42.307 --> 37:42.907
It makes sense.

37:43.508 --> 37:55.466
So I made a note in the journal, and I said, you know, I think this, and this all comes from not making money and not being driven by money, because when Bruce and I sat in one of our first meetings, he said, hey, listen, you know, neither one of us sent this to make money.

37:55.746 --> 37:57.769
Yeah, but that's an advantage, too, if the book sells.

37:57.970 --> 37:59.171
Right, exactly.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.253
It's just the advantage.

38:00.273 --> 38:01.635
So I'm sitting there saying...

38:02.678 --> 38:10.572
In my journal I wrote, I said, you know, I think this may be God's way of slapping me upside the head saying, hey, listen, son, don't lose sight of the fact that you never got in this to make money.

38:10.813 --> 38:12.416
What did the jock say?

38:12.456 --> 38:13.578
Keep your eye on the ball.

38:13.858 --> 38:14.981
Yeah, keep your eye on the ball.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.904
Know what it is that you're after here.

38:17.145 --> 38:17.746
It's not money.

38:17.926 --> 38:18.908
And what are you after here?

38:18.968 --> 38:20.250
What do you articulate?

38:20.631 --> 38:21.372
What am I after?

38:21.432 --> 38:24.518
There's a...

38:25.240 --> 38:31.028
You know, I had this religious experience when I was a kid, and I became a Methodist preacher and put myself through college preaching.

38:31.448 --> 38:33.811
Rob, you must have told me that.

38:33.831 --> 38:35.073
Well, it's a long time ago.

38:35.093 --> 38:37.136
Long time ago.

38:37.156 --> 38:38.057
The fact is, what's today?

38:38.077 --> 38:39.419
Today's the 9th, isn't it?

38:39.439 --> 38:40.860
Today's the 9th of February.

38:40.881 --> 38:41.621
I'll tell you a story.

38:42.102 --> 38:48.611
It was New Year's Eve, 1958.

38:48.691 --> 38:51.254
I was a freshman in college.

38:52.155 --> 38:52.716
So I can see it.

38:53.371 --> 39:01.019
My brother and I were out crow hunting.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.541
There was a ball game on or something.

39:02.922 --> 39:04.744
We'd either finish watching the ball game or whatever.

39:04.764 --> 39:08.167
We went up doing some crow hunting.

39:08.187 --> 39:13.894
I was the only male person in my family that didn't have a rifle.

39:13.974 --> 39:17.077
So my brother let me carry a little .410 .22 over and under.

39:17.097 --> 39:18.619
He had a 16 gauge Remington.

39:19.122 --> 39:21.586
Anyway, we go out in this field and there's a tree blown over.

39:21.726 --> 39:27.375
And we crawl inside this old dilapidated tree as a kind of a makeshift blind.

39:27.856 --> 39:30.700
And he got a crow call so he starts calling crows.

39:31.642 --> 39:38.273
And I'm standing there and I'm standing with my weight shifted so I'm over here.

39:38.994 --> 39:41.858
And I got my hand in my pocket and I'm holding my gun with my left hand.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.222
No, no.

39:44.623 --> 39:46.125
I moved

39:46.443 --> 39:51.811
myself to this position, take my hand out of the pocket, take the gun and just drop it sort of by my side.

39:52.552 --> 40:00.003
And at this moment, and this all happens of course in a second, at that very moment I felt this tug at my jacket.

40:00.303 --> 40:05.391
It was in Tennessee so it's kind of warm even though it's the 31st of December.

40:06.052 --> 40:07.774
I had on was a leather jacket and a t-shirt.

40:09.076 --> 40:14.965
And wouldn't have thought anything in the world about that tug at my jacket except that almost immediately after that I heard

40:15.417 --> 40:16.478
I heard the report of a rifle.

40:17.599 --> 40:19.861
And there was a kid standing about 50 yards away.

40:20.222 --> 40:21.062
He thought you were a deer.

40:21.323 --> 40:23.845
But now he heard the crow call.

40:23.865 --> 40:24.726
He didn't see anything.

40:24.746 --> 40:26.007
Didn't see any people down there.

40:26.147 --> 40:30.732
But he heard my brother crow call, pointed his .22 rifle, squeezed off a shot.

40:30.752 --> 40:30.872
Right.

40:31.252 --> 40:32.013
To kill the crow?

40:32.033 --> 40:33.815
To scare up the crow so he might be able to shoot.

40:33.835 --> 40:34.255
He was a kid.

40:34.295 --> 40:35.076
I mean, stupid.

40:35.116 --> 40:36.357
I mean, kids are, you know.

40:36.938 --> 40:37.979
So it was a random shot.

40:38.059 --> 40:38.759
Random shot.

40:38.839 --> 40:40.561
Absolutely.

40:40.821 --> 40:41.502
Random shot.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.623
It went between my arms.

40:42.890 --> 40:52.689
and my chest, hit my jacket, went into the pocket that my hand had just been in, ripped the pocket out, hit my t-shirt, made two holes in my t-shirt and didn't leave a scratch on me.

40:53.310 --> 41:06.214
I took that as a sign from God that He had something more in mind for me and then subsequently I became a licensed Methodist preacher.

41:06.717 --> 41:07.918
Here's the little rug on this.

41:07.959 --> 41:12.925
That happened 40 years and 40 days ago today.

41:12.945 --> 41:14.627
40-40.

41:14.647 --> 41:16.689
40 years and 40 days.

41:17.630 --> 41:20.554
And today was my hopeful deadline to finish all this work.

41:20.574 --> 41:22.056
It would have been, I think, very significant.

41:23.237 --> 41:24.258
So anyway, I had this release.

41:24.278 --> 41:24.979
Today is the deadline?

41:25.320 --> 41:26.701
No, well, it was sort of my fantasy deadline.

41:26.741 --> 41:27.302
Today was the projection.

41:27.322 --> 41:28.023
My fantasy deadline.

41:28.243 --> 41:29.805
My projected deadline.

41:29.825 --> 41:31.647
So why did you pick February the 9th?

41:31.727 --> 41:33.570
40 years and 40 days since that event.

41:33.590 --> 41:36.353
And so I'm actually doing this interview with you on the 40th.

41:36.687 --> 41:39.330
I can make a detail out of that.

41:39.350 --> 41:40.911
You can make a detail out of that.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.072
It's a significant detail.

41:42.793 --> 41:46.997
And the thing was, it came up in an interview with a local paper here.

41:47.157 --> 41:51.081
And a young man, 23-year-old interviewer, asked me where all this started.

41:51.221 --> 41:52.623
And I said, well, hell, I don't know.

41:52.703 --> 41:53.143
Let's see.

41:53.684 --> 41:58.529
And for the first time, I went that far back and picked that up.

41:58.609 --> 42:01.352
And then I don't know what made me do the calculation.

42:01.372 --> 42:04.855
I mean, it's easy to, from 1958 to 1998, it was 40 years.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.957
But then we're almost in February.

42:08.237 --> 42:09.719
February 9th would be 40 days.

42:10.420 --> 42:13.384
So it's going to be 40 years and 50 days or something like that.

42:13.604 --> 42:14.886
That was the projection day.

42:14.906 --> 42:16.348
Yeah, right.

42:16.408 --> 42:20.574
I have deadlines I set for myself which are realistic and fantasy.

42:20.594 --> 42:24.760
I mean, I sometimes really like to finish by this time, but I don't have to until this time, you know.

42:25.260 --> 42:29.466
And as I picked up in the journal, you've been doing other things concurrently, too.

42:29.486 --> 42:29.606
Right.

42:30.027 --> 42:32.971
Except for the last 18 months, I haven't done anything.

42:32.991 --> 42:33.392
Except this.

42:34.233 --> 42:34.453
Yeah.

42:34.670 --> 42:39.296
And I don't know if I'll, I'll never know whether I was right or wrong in making that decision.

42:39.336 --> 42:52.355
I made the decision right off that I would work the first year for only six months, and then the second year I would work six months or eight months, I guess it was, a third year, nine months, and the fourth year I would devote everything.

42:53.256 --> 42:56.340
And I'd be finished if I had

42:56.776 --> 42:57.437
stayed with it.

42:57.777 --> 42:59.399
Have you scrapped anything along the way?

42:59.659 --> 43:00.140
Scrapped?

43:00.460 --> 43:04.184
I've got a shelf full of blocks that have been scrapped.

43:04.224 --> 43:05.005
What happens?

43:05.165 --> 43:07.228
It looks great today, but it doesn't look great tomorrow?

43:07.248 --> 43:08.549
That's exactly it.

43:08.749 --> 43:09.650
That's one of the things.

43:09.710 --> 43:16.879
Another thing would be you start off an engraving with one mark, one line or something.

43:16.899 --> 43:22.144
And by God, if that line's not right, everything that follows it just doesn't go in the right place.

43:22.204 --> 43:23.286
It doesn't work.

43:23.306 --> 43:25.348
And so there are a few that have

43:25.666 --> 43:27.648
15 cuts in the surface.

43:27.668 --> 43:30.131
So it's an engraving kind of like a watercolor.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.993
There's no erasers.

43:32.093 --> 43:32.714
There's no erasing it.

43:32.894 --> 43:35.136
So you can't screw it up.

43:35.317 --> 43:36.077
You can't screw it up.

43:36.097 --> 43:38.100
It's one shot or chuck it.

43:38.180 --> 43:44.186
If you screw something up, you have to incorporate it and make it look like you meant it.

43:44.987 --> 43:49.152
It's like a cat falling off the table.

43:49.372 --> 43:50.853
That's tough when that happens.

43:51.915 --> 43:54.998
And if you're fortunate when it's a name that you're going to add on,

43:55.383 --> 44:02.512
a syllable, too, and get it right, you know, but boy, it's just in the middle, if you leave, like a My Name Nicholas, they always leave out the H. Right.

44:02.532 --> 44:05.576
I have an H in my Nicholas, you know, but a lot of people do.

44:05.596 --> 44:12.004
And Tom without an H, you know, is the usual, but sometimes with Tom so-and-so, oh, God, I'm sorry, I meant to say this, T-H-O-N.

44:12.064 --> 44:13.025
Yeah, I know, thanks a lot.

44:13.225 --> 44:16.309
I got a medal in the Navy, you know, and they misspelled my name.

44:16.810 --> 44:21.235
I actually went back to the Navy Department, I mean, it was nice to see what the damn thing is spelled right.

44:21.255 --> 44:25.120
I got an award from the AP for the first prize, they spelled my name wrong, you know,

44:25.640 --> 44:28.263
And I made them do it right, you know.

44:28.323 --> 44:30.124
Not that they have it hanging anywhere.

44:30.204 --> 44:32.447
And it's the first name, not the last name that they screw up.

44:32.467 --> 44:34.188
Well, with me, they got Nicholas Varonga.

44:34.749 --> 44:36.931
My surname is always getting killed.

44:37.231 --> 44:39.033
Baz Baines is not an easy name.

44:39.053 --> 44:40.795
You get the S left off a lot, I bet.

44:40.855 --> 44:47.061
Well, I got Bash Haines, Baz B-A-I-N-S, Biz Baines.

44:47.441 --> 44:50.764
When I first started at the Worcester paper, it was a hotshot reporter.

44:50.804 --> 44:51.765
I still have this paper.

44:52.302 --> 45:00.031
I had two bylines one day, many of them in this particular day, two bylines on page one, both misspelled and differently.

45:00.631 --> 45:07.659
So one editor misspelled my name one way, and another one misspelled it another way, and neither one of them got it right, and that's wonderful, you know.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.520
Both wrong.

45:08.781 --> 45:08.961
Anyway.

45:10.783 --> 45:12.785
Well, I get my last name misspelled a lot.

45:12.805 --> 45:14.767
They put an H in it, yeah.

45:14.828 --> 45:15.128
Moser.

45:15.508 --> 45:16.750
Well, people pronounce it Moser.

45:16.790 --> 45:20.554
My brother pronounces it Moser, but I pronounce it Moser.

45:21.108 --> 45:25.554
Who do you think is, I remember so many areas I want to cover here.

45:26.295 --> 45:27.016
I'm not in any art.

45:27.076 --> 45:27.636
No, no, no.

45:27.917 --> 45:28.557
That's great.

45:28.578 --> 45:31.882
We're going to have the time to do it, too.

45:31.902 --> 45:34.465
But we're talking about the engraving.

45:35.346 --> 45:38.290
Who's the buyer for this book?

45:38.310 --> 45:39.471
The owner, not the buyer.

45:39.491 --> 45:40.793
Who do you perceive?

45:40.813 --> 45:48.583
Well, unfortunately for my, when I say I lead off with the word unfortunately, I may wish I hadn't done that as soon as I finished this.

45:49.323 --> 46:00.562
Yeah, unfortunately, the buyer for the Pennyroll Caxton Bible is going to have to be either institutions like the American Bible Society, libraries, or wealthy individuals.

46:01.684 --> 46:02.986
But no, let me alter that.

46:03.186 --> 46:11.280
And a fourth category are people who are not wealthy individuals, but who want the thing so badly because they love books.

46:11.682 --> 46:13.524
are starting to put money aside for it.

46:13.544 --> 46:34.011
I know at least two instances in which people, one, Ann Patchett, she and her mother are pooling their money to buy a copy of this thing, and Norman Stevens, who's a librarian emeritus at the University of Connecticut Libraries, and he set up his own savings account, a little savings account he put money in, so that when in time... For himself or for the university?

46:34.031 --> 46:35.453
For himself.

46:35.853 --> 46:39.478
Do you think it's a fair comment to say that every generation deserves its

46:39.965 --> 46:40.806
I've written it.

46:41.126 --> 46:49.033
In fact, you've been involved in Dante, and how every generation deserves perhaps its own new translation of Dante, or its new edition of Shakespeare.

46:49.333 --> 46:53.657
Do you think every generation deserves its own, or demands its own Bible?

46:55.179 --> 46:57.120
In terms of language, I think that's certainly true.

46:58.241 --> 47:01.664
I don't think any of the... Or edition, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

47:01.825 --> 47:02.525
An edition, though.

47:02.545 --> 47:02.645
Yeah.

47:03.066 --> 47:07.930
But I'm saying, and the various editions that we have that have been published in the last, what, 40 years, 50 years,

47:08.635 --> 47:11.518
all have to do with language.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.000
And I think that's true.

47:13.280 --> 47:22.832
I think that, I mean, even in my work on the Bible, I'm using the King James, which I think is unsurpassed in the stateliness of its language and the elegance of its language.

47:22.852 --> 47:25.995
I also go to other translations.

47:26.015 --> 47:31.201
I read four or five other translations to see what other translators have.

47:32.002 --> 47:32.503
Hey, Dan?

47:33.164 --> 47:33.664
Come here a minute.

47:34.245 --> 47:35.506
You want to see something really weird?

47:36.568 --> 47:37.849
Check the hurry before he quits.

47:38.082 --> 47:38.963
Look at Truman.

47:40.165 --> 47:42.888
He just bit off a limb of that thing.

47:42.949 --> 47:43.850
Look at this.

47:43.870 --> 47:47.194
The son of a bitch is tearing it up.

47:47.394 --> 47:48.616
He's going to kill himself.

47:48.696 --> 47:51.039
That's poisonous.

47:51.059 --> 47:52.061
What are you doing?

47:53.102 --> 47:56.527
Those dogs are indestructible.

47:56.547 --> 47:59.431
My puppy that's sick, she used to eat the siding off the house.

47:59.911 --> 48:05.018
She used to leave her in the car for a while, she'd eat the leather off the seats.

48:06.078 --> 48:12.230
Well, yesterday, Truman was in the studio, and he just went, no, nothing announcing that's going to happen.

48:12.251 --> 48:15.938
He let out this enormous puddle of puke.

48:16.860 --> 48:17.401
Oh, that's great.

48:17.421 --> 48:23.153
And it's not something I can pick up easily, so I have to get a dustpan out, and I'm squeegeeing the stuff up off the carpet.

48:23.173 --> 48:25.056
Did he get a kick in the ass for that?

48:25.077 --> 48:26.820
No, he was, you know, poor guy.

48:27.273 --> 48:32.760
And it had this really awful odor, but it was an odor that I recognized.

48:33.100 --> 48:38.667
It's the odor of a zoo, and one with these little pellets in it.

48:38.687 --> 48:40.309
He'd been out in the woods eating deer shit.

48:43.813 --> 48:47.578
Couldn't digest it, chucked it up on the rug.

48:48.119 --> 48:52.504
Well, we talk about the textual edition, but I mean,

48:52.940 --> 48:56.544
An illustrated edition, though, no, it hasn't been illustrated since 1865.

48:56.705 --> 48:58.927
This is the first illustrated Bible?

48:58.947 --> 49:00.369
First illustrated Bible since 1869.

49:00.389 --> 49:02.091
Is that part of the attraction for you?

49:02.111 --> 49:02.612
Absolutely.

49:03.373 --> 49:04.795
There hasn't been one in the 20th century.

49:04.815 --> 49:05.535
Why is that?

49:05.555 --> 49:06.577
People are afraid of it?

49:06.597 --> 49:10.622
Okay, now that's why I spent two hours this morning writing about it.

49:10.702 --> 49:11.783
This is a question.

49:11.803 --> 49:12.904
Now Ike's doing it.

49:12.924 --> 49:15.367
He's out there taking that trick.

49:15.988 --> 49:22.356
The question has been asked, and I have said this, and I've said that, and I have not yet...

49:22.876 --> 49:24.217
come up with a good answer.

49:24.237 --> 49:27.581
What I'll do is I'll print my answer out for you so you can have it in writing.

49:27.601 --> 49:30.203
But yes, fear plays a part of it.

49:30.223 --> 49:33.226
Fear of failing is such a huge thing to do.

49:33.787 --> 49:41.735
Fear of the text itself, the lack of interest in religion and a secular society.

49:43.016 --> 49:50.183
Most fine artists are not willing to let their work be subservient to anything else, much less some sort of a literary text.

49:50.770 --> 50:07.289
I think that—and this gets real tricky for me because I don't think of myself as a critic and I don't want to come off seeming, you know, like I think of myself as being anything extraordinary because I don't think of myself as being anything extraordinary.

50:07.429 --> 50:10.893
But I think that—and the hell is going on.

50:12.675 --> 50:20.524
I think that a lot of the art that has been produced in the last half of the 20th century, especially after World War II,

50:21.095 --> 50:25.862
has become increasingly puerile.

50:26.022 --> 50:32.713
It is infatuated with its own self-adoring.

50:36.298 --> 50:38.581
We're talking about art for folks now.

50:38.601 --> 50:39.262
Art in general.

50:39.283 --> 50:40.584
Art in general.

50:40.725 --> 50:48.216
And I think that people, that artists just don't want to spend the time

50:48.685 --> 50:55.672
They, I think, are wary of the—I mean, I say this from my experience as a teacher of art students at, say, RISD.

50:57.714 --> 51:00.397
They're not taught anything about philosophy.

51:00.437 --> 51:02.379
They're not taught anything about thinking.

51:02.459 --> 51:06.964
They're not interested in letters, essentially.

51:07.304 --> 51:15.553
And to approach a thing like this, at the level that I'm trying to approach it, which is something other than Sunday school pictures,

51:16.242 --> 51:21.850
Jesus Christ, I mean, the intellectual sort of demands that it makes are enormous.

51:22.571 --> 51:25.375
And I think that's off-putting to an awful lot of visual artists.

51:26.877 --> 51:30.002
There are a lot of reasons, a complicated answer, but I would, don't let me forget that.

51:30.082 --> 51:34.248
Okay, so I see, so I'll query very... Yeah, I'll do it right now.

51:34.268 --> 51:34.689
Kara?

51:35.730 --> 51:36.471
She's probably on the phone.

51:37.032 --> 51:40.457
Would you print out yesterday's journal entry?

51:42.680 --> 51:43.161
Thank you.

51:44.896 --> 51:49.382
Is this book, and all of them, this is a book that's going to cost $10,000.

51:50.643 --> 51:52.806
Is this book meant by you to be read?

51:53.347 --> 51:53.627
Yes.

51:54.468 --> 51:55.029
Absolutely.

51:55.049 --> 52:05.463
And that's why I wanted, from the very beginning, I have been... It's not a precious object meant to be put in a glass cabinet and treated as an artifact.

52:05.523 --> 52:05.783
Right.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.989
It is a precious object, and it is going to be kept as an artifact.

52:10.049 --> 52:11.490
But it's also meant to be handled.

52:11.510 --> 52:12.692
But it's meant to be handled.

52:13.347 --> 52:20.356
And the use of the materials, the choice of the materials, all have to do with things that actually get more beautiful the more they are handled.

52:20.416 --> 52:22.018
I was just in Mount Athos in Greece.

52:22.619 --> 52:23.300
I wrote a piece.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.443
A Smithsonian commissioned it.

52:25.503 --> 52:26.845
I still haven't heard from it.

52:26.885 --> 52:29.568
I get a little nervous after a while.

52:30.309 --> 52:30.950
Lovely piece.

52:30.970 --> 52:35.676
But in any case, I was in this monastic library that's a thousand years old.

52:36.162 --> 52:38.886
I mean, they have things there that go back to the year 963.

52:39.286 --> 52:47.397
And here's a book from the 11th century, Vella Glax, you know, an illumination on it to, you know, gold and lapis.

52:47.598 --> 52:56.029
And here is where it's really born from over the centuries by the monks and their oils, their hands.

52:56.270 --> 52:58.973
And there's just a whole different texture to it.

52:59.013 --> 53:03.199
And of course, it is a precious, gorgeous, exquisite object.

53:03.432 --> 53:05.615
But it's also meant to be handled.

53:05.636 --> 53:06.837
Absolutely.

53:06.877 --> 53:08.961
Meant to be turned page by page.

53:08.981 --> 53:11.124
A little dog on a page, you know?

53:11.264 --> 53:11.966
That's fine.

53:12.006 --> 53:12.987
That's the way it ought to be.

53:13.007 --> 53:15.992
Yeah, I have people that say they don't want books that have been written in or signed.

53:16.092 --> 53:25.006
I'd love to acquire a book that has the name of a prior owner or an inscription, a very warm inscription from a husband to a wife.

53:25.147 --> 53:25.407
Right.

53:26.332 --> 53:27.494
a mother to a child.

53:27.534 --> 53:28.916
Our marginal note.

53:28.936 --> 53:31.319
Our marginal intelligent annotations, you know.

53:31.860 --> 53:33.542
If you qualify it.

53:33.822 --> 53:37.527
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:37.547 --> 53:52.628
Well, no, I very much agree with that, and it's very much one of the reasons why I chose this particular version of the King James, which has no verse numbers, because it allows... Excuse me.

53:52.648 --> 53:54.331
Here we are.

53:54.551 --> 53:54.651
Yeah.

53:55.019 --> 53:56.381
There's the answer to your question.

53:56.481 --> 53:57.522
Oh, good.

53:57.542 --> 54:00.987
This is earlier, but I want you to describe one of these things for me.

54:01.007 --> 54:02.930
Oh, God, I'm going to give you more stuff than that.

54:02.950 --> 54:03.471
Oh, you are?

54:03.491 --> 54:04.692
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.035
But let me have that anyway, so we don't forget.

54:07.136 --> 54:08.197
Have you seen the Prescott?

54:08.237 --> 54:08.598
Obviously.

54:08.638 --> 54:09.919
Yeah, yeah.

54:09.939 --> 54:11.722
This is fantastic.

54:11.842 --> 54:13.725
Look at that.

54:13.765 --> 54:14.586
That's pretty nice.

54:14.606 --> 54:17.370
You know that Andrew Hoyam is charging $25 for his prospectus.

54:18.171 --> 54:19.913
That doesn't surprise me, but...

54:20.348 --> 54:24.993
We're giving these things away, and these things cost almost that much to do.

54:25.973 --> 54:27.215
What is he doing, by the way?

54:27.315 --> 54:28.556
Well, he's doing a lectern Bible.

54:29.577 --> 54:33.601
He's doing, but has no illustrations in it.

54:33.681 --> 54:34.862
It's not a competition, is it?

54:34.982 --> 54:36.944
No, I don't see it as competition.

54:36.964 --> 54:44.792
It's just that Andrew and I are not, well, we're on speaking terms, put it that way.

54:45.332 --> 54:50.237
The only fist fight I've ever been in as an adult was with him.

54:50.690 --> 54:53.033
We came to, we came to blows one night.

54:53.514 --> 54:53.774
Here?

54:54.875 --> 54:55.656
Yeah.

54:55.676 --> 54:56.057
Thanks.

54:56.898 --> 54:58.660
Wherever you would do it.

54:58.680 --> 55:03.246
Um, do you think of... Let's do it.

55:03.747 --> 55:04.848
Whatever you'd like to say.

55:04.868 --> 55:05.589
This is great, huh?

55:06.290 --> 55:08.012
He's trying to do it where it won't show through.

55:08.853 --> 55:09.855
Now let's do it right here.

55:11.997 --> 55:14.661
It's kind of nice.

55:14.681 --> 55:17.044
Make sure you put the date because it's the 40 year 40 days.

55:17.144 --> 55:18.366
Yeah, we'll do that.

55:19.207 --> 55:19.567
It's kind of cool.

55:19.587 --> 55:20.308
Let's set this up for a second here.

55:22.043 --> 55:23.305
We're back on again.

55:23.325 --> 55:25.629
I might have heard myself telling this whole story.

55:25.649 --> 55:28.193
I want to scream at myself.

55:28.213 --> 55:29.395
I understand.

55:29.415 --> 55:31.057
No, I think you're absolutely right.

55:31.197 --> 55:37.507
I mean, the book has more to do than just the paper and the ink and the blocks being impressed in it and all that sort of thing.

55:37.527 --> 55:46.802
I mean, it's like any work of art, if I may be so bold as to assume that this might be a work of art, it's greater than the sum of its parts.

55:47.609 --> 55:52.184
And you are a person who involves yourself in every step of the project.

55:52.204 --> 55:57.180
And I don't know if we've ever talked about that, but in this book, you're signing off on the paper.

55:57.582 --> 56:00.387
On the binding, on the type.

56:00.708 --> 56:02.811
And you've made type for this, is that right?

56:03.132 --> 56:04.735
I had type made for it.

56:05.957 --> 56:15.934
Matthew Carter designed a new typeface, and he designed some new ornaments for the typography, and he refit the capital letters for this particular setting.

56:16.055 --> 56:18.038
So why did you feel that was necessary?

56:18.457 --> 56:20.059
all of these different things.

56:20.079 --> 56:25.927
Well, Psalm 119, I think it is 121, I can't remember now which one it is, but it's an acrostic.

56:25.967 --> 56:29.772
And a lot of translations see that the Hebrew letters are left out.

56:30.193 --> 56:32.997
Sometimes they're spelled out, you know, A-L-E-F-A-L-E-P-H.

56:33.998 --> 56:41.468
I like the idea of reminding my reader that this isn't European literature, that this is Semitic literature that we're looking at here, boys and girls.

56:42.109 --> 56:46.455
And so every now and again, give me the opportunity to put the Hebrew in here, and I'm going to put the Hebrew in.

56:46.942 --> 56:51.108
And so that was an opportunity, and in order to do that, I had to have a Hebrew alphabet.

56:51.128 --> 56:58.138
And I used to ask Matthew Carter if he would be interested in doing that.

56:58.238 --> 56:59.740
And he said, yeah.

57:00.001 --> 57:08.673
And he had a Hebrew typeface that was contemporary with the Jensen that he used as a model for Galliard, and so it's great, and it worked out nicely.

57:09.394 --> 57:13.540
And I wanted a couple of decorative elements.

57:14.178 --> 57:26.552
I wanted a pilcrow for my paragraph marks, but I didn't particularly like the pilcrow that—I hope you don't quote me on this—that he had designed for Galliard.

57:26.832 --> 57:27.593
It was too black.

57:27.734 --> 57:29.475
It just made these little black spots on the face.

57:30.096 --> 57:37.985
So I wanted him to redesign it and base it basically on Bruce Rogers' centaur pilcrow.

57:38.005 --> 57:43.932
So anyway, he did, and yeah, attention to that kind of detail, though, I think is absolutely imperative.

57:44.333 --> 57:46.155
Are the book arts becoming a quaint?

57:47.717 --> 57:48.318
I don't think so.

57:48.598 --> 57:49.759
I don't think so at all.

57:49.779 --> 58:05.337
In fact, I see an awful lot of universities and various schools and institutions where they're offering courses in the book arts and read articles every now and again where it doesn't seem to be dying.

58:06.118 --> 58:08.380
And I don't know what it's... Who knows?

58:08.420 --> 58:11.624
I mean, maybe it's a... I'm going to have to go out there and stop my dog.

58:11.644 --> 58:12.986
He's going to get sick.

58:13.046 --> 58:13.586
He's going to stop.

58:13.606 --> 58:14.307
In fact...

58:16.953 --> 58:22.178
I really do pay attention to all these details.

58:22.298 --> 58:24.019
It's like being the architect of a building.

58:24.059 --> 58:31.466
I mean, I have to, I'm responsible for all those things, though I don't necessarily, you know, get up and hammer nails myself.

58:33.148 --> 58:44.758
Like, I don't do the printing myself, but I'm certainly in the position to, well, actually, I'm in the position to be responsible for that printing if it's not up to my standards.

58:44.878 --> 58:46.960
But, God, I've got the greatest printer on this thing.

58:47.767 --> 58:48.648
Yeah, it's really good.

58:49.589 --> 58:54.995
I've never had to do anything to sit back and say, God, this looks beautiful.

58:55.116 --> 58:55.896
And where is that then?

58:56.137 --> 58:56.978
Austin, Texas.

58:56.998 --> 59:00.322
So there's a lot of trust involved.

59:00.402 --> 59:01.823
There's also that.

59:01.843 --> 59:06.569
The building of shipping cartons and crates and all this kind of stuff.

59:06.589 --> 59:08.091
I mean, oh my God.

59:08.972 --> 59:10.213
See, that's why the journal.

59:11.223 --> 59:18.073
It's to give anybody who's interested at some point an idea of just how complicated a thing like this is.

59:18.674 --> 59:24.923
And all of that complexity, I hope, disappears once the book is in somebody's hand.

59:25.524 --> 59:33.196
It then becomes this intimate object that cuts everything out between this text and the reader.

59:33.817 --> 59:38.884
Now, you sent me that piece that you wrote on the self-portraits, but you did choose, I think you said before,

59:39.083 --> 59:46.435
Yeah, but they're not really intended to be self-portraits, but they're there.

59:46.976 --> 59:50.722
It's mostly a matter of convenience, more than anything.

59:51.183 --> 59:51.984
Convenience of what?

59:52.485 --> 59:54.669
Convenience that I don't have to go hire somebody to do it.

59:55.470 --> 59:55.951
To do what?

59:55.971 --> 59:56.612
To be a model?

59:56.652 --> 59:57.734
To be the model.

59:57.754 --> 59:59.036
Do you have a model?

59:59.056 --> 59:59.597
Oh, God, yeah.

59:59.677 --> 01:00:00.578
I'll show you photographs.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:03.403
We probably have

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:06.509
3,000 photographs of this project, too.

01:00:06.529 --> 01:00:06.810
Really?

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:07.290
Wow.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:08.771
So there's a major archive.

01:00:09.032 --> 01:00:09.772
Major archive.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.794
And where will you be depositing the archive?

01:00:11.814 --> 01:00:12.715
They'll all go over to Dartmouth.

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:15.257
That's where my archives are.

01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:16.158
So they'll all go up there.

01:00:16.178 --> 01:00:18.640
And does it go up there after each project, after each book?

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.221
Pretty much so, except for children's books.

01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:23.044
And my children's books go down to University of Connecticut.

01:00:23.444 --> 01:00:24.225
Oh, great.

01:00:24.765 --> 01:00:27.167
Children's New England Book Collection.

01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:28.228
So that all goes down there.

01:00:28.408 --> 01:00:32.952
But I forgot where I was.

01:00:33.117 --> 01:00:34.318
We were talking about models.

01:00:34.719 --> 01:00:36.001
Oh, yeah.

01:00:36.021 --> 01:00:47.334
Yeah, I mean, I have, I hired a 65-year-old guy, former army sergeant who's a nudist and models for life drawing classes all over this part of the world.

01:00:47.995 --> 01:00:50.038
I hired him to come up to be my model for Job.

01:00:50.058 --> 01:00:51.800
Now tell me a few of these things.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.621
Yeah, this is good.

01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:53.382
I like this kind of stuff.

01:00:53.922 --> 01:00:58.568
And then I have a young woman that has done some modeling for me for

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:02.533
my figure of the destroyer and so forth.

01:01:02.614 --> 01:01:03.515
What were you looking for?

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:06.339
Is it the text that suggests the kind of... Yeah.

01:01:06.359 --> 01:01:07.981
Well, the text, not so much.

01:01:08.021 --> 01:01:12.387
I mean, like, for instance, the portrait of Jesus that you see in the prospectus.

01:01:12.487 --> 01:01:20.217
I mean, I was sitting where you're sitting one night when you're having dinner up here, and a friend of mine had hired this guy to prepare dinner.

01:01:20.658 --> 01:01:23.982
He was a chef over here in Amherst at Pinocchio's.

01:01:24.873 --> 01:01:48.415
And I'm watching, and he's got this wonderful face, very chiseled sort of sculpted face, and a smallish man, you know, 5'7", 5'8", and black hair, pulled back in a ponytail, and I asked him after a few drinks and wine, I said, hey, Lou, his name was Lou Silver, Louis Silver, I said, would you take that rubber band out of your hair?

01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:51.538
He looked at me kind of strange, he said, sure.

01:01:52.582 --> 01:01:58.609
took the thing out and his black hair fell down around his shoulders and I said, oh shit, listen, hey, how about doing me a favor?

01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:07.338
Would you mind getting almost naked and letting me put a crown of thorn on you and would you be my Jesus?

01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:09.861
Would you be my Jesus?

01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:10.802
Would you be my Jesus?

01:02:10.822 --> 01:02:11.443
And he said, yeah.

01:02:12.384 --> 01:02:13.224
He agreed to do it.

01:02:13.305 --> 01:02:19.051
And then my Virgin Mary was a waitress at Green Street Cafe in Northampton.

01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:19.932
I saw her one night.

01:02:19.972 --> 01:02:21.053
I was sitting there with Jane Dyer.

01:02:21.303 --> 01:02:28.029
In fact, it was Jane Dyer that hired Lewis to come and do this meal for her, but she did it here instead of her house because my kitchen's bigger than her kitchen.

01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:50.770
So what did you see in this waitress that all of a sudden... I saw not what one would think of as the classic sort of Greek classic beauty, nor even the kind of beauty that you would associate with, say, Playboy magazine, but a beauty that sort of transcends

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:52.579
that in a sense.

01:02:54.302 --> 01:03:09.281
A plainness, but yet a strikingly unusual and a very large pinch of the erotic, of the sensuous.

01:03:10.643 --> 01:03:16.972
And in my thinking, the mother of God ought to be a little, well, sensuous.

01:03:17.232 --> 01:03:17.893
I would think so.

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:21.077
That's a pretty big order.

01:03:21.428 --> 01:03:24.732
Maybe you're going to be the mother of pride.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:30.901
And if you're going to get knocked up by God, you better be, by God, pretty good looking.

01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:32.963
I promise I'll be tasteful at how I use this.

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:34.065
Okay, that's all right.

01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:36.468
I trust you will.

01:03:36.488 --> 01:03:47.723
But no, I mean, so those were the kind, and I'm also always looking for people who are a little bit of a cross type that aren't what you would really expect.

01:03:48.850 --> 01:04:05.553
And that helps take me away from the cliched images of Jesus and all this kind of saccharine crap that Protestant illustrators have always managed to do when they've done images of Biblical nature.

01:04:05.713 --> 01:04:09.698
You know, they just, somehow or another, Protestants have got no passion.

01:04:09.819 --> 01:04:13.744
Yeah, when you just think of all the pictures in Sunday School of Jesus walking in the field.

01:04:13.927 --> 01:04:15.609
And they all look the same.

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:16.010
Right.

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.893
It's the same face with the... Yeah.

01:04:18.113 --> 01:04:20.316
High key paintings, you know, a lot of blue sky.

01:04:20.737 --> 01:04:21.097
Exactly.

01:04:21.678 --> 01:04:23.400
Or you go to Greece and they all look like Greeks.

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:24.442
Right, right.

01:04:24.462 --> 01:04:25.243
All the saints.

01:04:25.263 --> 01:04:28.207
Now, when you were growing up, did you grow up in a Protestant church or the Orthodox church?

01:04:28.227 --> 01:04:29.209
A little bit of both.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:30.150
Yeah.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:37.180
I am Greek Orthodox, which is of immeasurable value to me when I went to Mount Athos, because if memory does, it puts you literally in a private church.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:37.741
Yeah.

01:04:37.761 --> 01:04:40.204
And you get special privileges, you know.

01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:43.558
But I'm Greek Orthodox.

01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:50.946
My father, who was brought up in a partisan orphanage, had some ties to it.

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:58.915
So you know all of those Sunday school documents, church for Sunday school, and we also went to Greek school.

01:05:00.236 --> 01:05:01.558
You know the drill.

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:03.320
Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:08.385
But what you do is, if you're very traditional, how many artists actually do their

01:05:10.053 --> 01:05:17.365
And then go and engrave them on wood blocks and think in terms of doing reversals and pulling blocks.

01:05:17.385 --> 01:05:19.227
I mean, I can't think of any others, to be honest.

01:05:19.468 --> 01:05:24.656
Well, yeah, there are, but they're not a lot of us.

01:05:25.738 --> 01:05:27.701
And what is the appeal for you?

01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:29.804
I mean, is it the degree of difficulty?

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:31.427
It's certainly a big part of it.

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.529
It really is.

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:34.351
It is that degree of difficulty.

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:37.917
I think it's partly having to do with the

01:05:38.588 --> 01:06:03.702
With my tenacity as a person, I went to military school for six years when I was a kid, you know that, and in that military school, more than anything, I learned, well, how to survive, how to carry on in the face of what always seemed to be inevitable humiliation.

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:08.674
You know, I wrestled, but I never won a wrestling match in my life.

01:06:08.775 --> 01:06:09.656
I played football.

01:06:09.876 --> 01:06:17.164
I never played first string until I was, after having played varsity for two years, and I dropped down and played junior varsity, and then I got to play.

01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:25.994
I was never very good at these things, but I've always been tenacious and go after things sometimes that are bigger than I am.

01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:27.856
Knoxville is one of my papers, by the way.

01:06:28.356 --> 01:06:28.857
What is it?

01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:30.118
The Knoxville New Sentinel.

01:06:30.198 --> 01:06:30.739
Oh, really?

01:06:30.759 --> 01:06:31.159
Yeah.

01:06:31.299 --> 01:06:33.722
I mean, I'll do a piece, not just Biblio, I'll do a piece.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.682
when the trade edition comes out.

01:06:35.702 --> 01:06:38.185
It was foolish to do it for this.

01:06:38.225 --> 01:06:40.248
That wouldn't help anybody.

01:06:40.348 --> 01:06:42.650
That would be great.

01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:44.132
That will be this fall.

01:06:44.493 --> 01:06:46.835
I'll run that piece.

01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:50.039
We're negotiating now what the exact pub date is.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.501
I get the story.

01:06:52.302 --> 01:06:54.184
I'm in sync with all that stuff.

01:06:54.224 --> 01:07:00.572
For us, it's kind of frustrating because Bruce Cobner, my man, my partner, is absolutely adamant.

01:07:00.632 --> 01:07:01.313
And so am I.

01:07:01.478 --> 01:07:29.258
uh that the trade edition not come out before ours it can't well it can but it shouldn't it shouldn't yeah but it should actually not even be relevant i think to me it's too different it is two different books and in and in one and in a greater sense it isn't relevant you're absolutely right and i was just saying that yesterday to care i said you know fact is who cares i mean everybody who's buying these things know that we're starting to ship books in november and we will start with the first 10 that we get from the boundary

01:07:29.693 --> 01:07:31.636
And then when we get the next 10, we'll send them.

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:32.677
And that's going to be a process.

01:07:32.697 --> 01:07:33.418
And everybody knows this.

01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:37.084
They get a letter stating this, that the books will be shipped between November and April.

01:07:37.164 --> 01:07:38.986
And that is being shipped according to when you bought it?

01:07:39.006 --> 01:07:40.228
According to deposit.

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:42.151
Yeah, the order of deposit.

01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:45.896
So the priority in terms of the numbers is when you weigh in.

01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:47.178
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:47.198 --> 01:07:48.039
You know who's that number one?

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.722
Virginia Hamilton.

01:07:49.742 --> 01:07:50.222
No kidding.

01:07:50.323 --> 01:07:51.004
Yeah.

01:07:51.024 --> 01:07:52.766
She has copy number one right now.

01:07:54.008 --> 01:07:54.148
Uh-huh.

01:07:54.702 --> 01:07:56.225
What would your hope be?

01:07:56.926 --> 01:07:59.410
Would you hope to have this thing fully subscribed within a year?

01:08:00.572 --> 01:08:06.102
My hope is that we have it fully subscribed by October, October, November.

01:08:06.342 --> 01:08:07.224
I'd like for it to be.

01:08:07.544 --> 01:08:09.748
And that would really be a nice feeling for you, too.

01:08:09.988 --> 01:08:19.765
It certainly would, because it means that Bruce will have made back his money, and it means that I will make a little money, which would be very nice, a nice little reward at the end of this long road.

01:08:20.217 --> 01:08:23.041
And then, of course, we have the trade edition.

01:08:23.081 --> 01:08:24.963
We have no idea what the trade edition is going to do.

01:08:25.544 --> 01:08:29.409
I mean, it's either going to go gangbusters or it's going to go tits up, you know.

01:08:29.429 --> 01:08:31.632
Well, it's going to be a one-volume deal, right?

01:08:31.973 --> 01:08:32.513
To begin with.

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:37.460
See, it's one of the reasons I went with Viking, because they've got some really interesting ideas about marketing this thing.

01:08:38.602 --> 01:08:41.546
They wanted to—Bullfish, for instance, was one of the major places.

01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:43.048
I like both of them.

01:08:43.408 --> 01:08:48.655
They do nice books, and they wanted to go out with about a hundred, $120 book, two volumes.

01:08:50.002 --> 01:08:53.047
Better to have a lower price for this.

01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:54.109
Yes, yes.

01:08:54.209 --> 01:09:04.567
So what Viking's idea is, you go out first with a book that you produce on a web press, and you get it out there in a fairly significant edition, and you get it out for a reasonable cost, $65.

01:09:04.767 --> 01:09:06.210
Good quality.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.472
They're doing three runs.

01:09:08.173 --> 01:09:11.579
They're doing a run for the text, a run for the illustrations, and a run for the red.

01:09:11.599 --> 01:09:12.060
Same size?

01:09:12.327 --> 01:09:14.650
No, it's much smaller.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.591
It's about this big.

01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:16.972
So is this reduced?

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:17.893
This reduced.

01:09:17.913 --> 01:09:18.614
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:18.634 --> 01:09:19.255
Just reduced.

01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:20.756
85% of that size.

01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:27.003
And they, but they're putting the panes into producing it well.

01:09:27.324 --> 01:09:34.672
But next year, if it does well in a one volume, $65, next year, it's going to replate and do it in two volumes.

01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:35.853
Sure, boxed probably.

01:09:36.033 --> 01:09:38.636
Boxed up, little ribbon, three times as much money.

01:09:38.656 --> 01:09:40.318
Nice paper label on the spine.

01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:41.119
Exactly.

01:09:41.673 --> 01:09:51.164
And then they're thinking, well, then what we might do is break it into its five sections, so someone could buy the books of history by themselves without anything.

01:09:51.184 --> 01:09:55.630
See, that shows the great... It has, as they say, legs, you know.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:59.454
But I mean, just the way they're thinking like that shows that they must be very excited to have it.

01:09:59.474 --> 01:10:00.455
They are, yeah.

01:10:00.475 --> 01:10:02.197
And it's going to be their lead book for the fall.

01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:03.499
Is that a five year studio?

01:10:03.519 --> 01:10:04.440
Oh yeah.

01:10:05.348 --> 01:10:06.529
Not for Viking.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:11.536
I've been working with these publishers for 21 years, so I know them intimately.

01:10:11.556 --> 01:10:12.917
It's very exciting for me.

01:10:12.937 --> 01:10:13.578
It is.

01:10:13.798 --> 01:10:16.342
And for a buck and a half, is that the final number?

01:10:16.562 --> 01:10:17.343
Is that what you sold it for?

01:10:17.363 --> 01:10:18.925
That's a good price, by the way.

01:10:18.985 --> 01:10:19.325
It is.

01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:22.629
Nothing to be ashamed of.

01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:24.191
I'm just comparing it to Paula Barberi.

01:10:24.211 --> 01:10:25.153
I'm sorry.

01:10:25.173 --> 01:10:27.696
Oh, yeah.

01:10:27.716 --> 01:10:30.599
You know what's that other guy that did that book called Babyhood?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.583
There's a TV star.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.568
I don't know what, so I don't know, but some television actor did a book on babyhood.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.131
Oh, my God.

01:10:41.572 --> 01:10:42.193
Paul Reiser?

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:42.634
Yes.

01:10:43.074 --> 01:10:43.174
Yeah.

01:10:43.194 --> 01:10:44.677
I would like to strangle him.

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:45.358
Yeah.

01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:47.742
That's right.

01:10:47.762 --> 01:10:48.884
There it goes.

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:50.567
Okay, that's a self-portrait.

01:10:50.587 --> 01:10:51.228
It's a portrait of?

01:10:51.529 --> 01:10:52.270
It's Polyphemus.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:58.581
Polyphemus, which is the one-eyed person in the Odyssey.

01:10:58.601 --> 01:11:00.043
I didn't get any idea.

01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:01.434
But that's you using it?

01:11:01.454 --> 01:11:02.075
Yeah, that's me.

01:11:03.156 --> 01:11:03.797
Barry, Barry.

01:11:03.857 --> 01:11:06.200
I have better teeth than that.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.542
I don't have a red beard.

01:11:07.782 --> 01:11:09.344
The Blinding of Polyphemus.

01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:14.911
And this book is The Trojan War.

01:11:17.013 --> 01:11:18.675
And what year is that now?

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:19.236
Last year.

01:11:20.337 --> 01:11:20.938
Any adventures?

01:11:20.978 --> 01:11:22.179
The Dry Column.

01:11:23.922 --> 01:11:25.263
Who published it?

01:11:25.283 --> 01:11:25.684
Tomorrow.

01:11:26.525 --> 01:11:27.566
I love their books.

01:11:27.586 --> 01:11:28.427
1997.

01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.029
I think they do terrific children.

01:11:32.631 --> 01:11:32.911
They do.

01:11:32.931 --> 01:11:33.812
They do so much.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:37.276
Here's in the little, oh, this is a book I did with Willie Morris.

01:11:37.656 --> 01:11:42.982
Prayer for the opening of Little League.

01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:46.666
See, here's a little, in my pictures, there's a girl.

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:54.935
And here's a little guy that committed into a girl which never hit.

01:11:54.955 --> 01:11:57.638
Comfort the smallest of the ballplayers who have never gotten a hit.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.202
Little League season, that's the title, right?

01:12:00.923 --> 01:12:01.003
Yes.

01:12:01.023 --> 01:12:01.964
Prayer for the opening of.

01:12:02.204 --> 01:12:02.624
A prayer.

01:12:03.045 --> 01:12:06.609
Prayer for the opening of the Little League season.

01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:12.195
Harcourt Brace 19, when is it?

01:12:13.156 --> 01:12:13.396
Yeah, 1990.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:13.897
Who's the author again?

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:15.098
Willie Morris.

01:12:18.121 --> 01:12:19.703
And is this all a portrait in here?

01:12:19.723 --> 01:12:20.424
Yeah.

01:12:20.624 --> 01:12:23.007
And this is a portrait of Willie.

01:12:23.988 --> 01:12:24.509
The umpire?

01:12:24.929 --> 01:12:25.870
That's my housekeeper.

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:27.922
The father.

01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:30.024
The retributive father.

01:12:30.044 --> 01:12:31.285
The retributive daddy.

01:12:32.907 --> 01:12:37.932
And then my self-portrait is here.

01:12:37.952 --> 01:12:40.896
Eating a hot dog.

01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:41.296
Eating a hot dog.

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.617
That's great.

01:12:42.637 --> 01:12:49.084
Can you explain all this, why this has become something that you do in that piece?

01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:56.312
It was a, it began as a, as a, the first time I did it was in Moby Dick.

01:12:56.613 --> 01:13:02.640
And I put myself in the scene where the hands are swabbing and cleaning up the decks.

01:13:04.382 --> 01:13:17.538
And it was a statement about the way I felt I had been treated in the project, that my intellect wasn't respected, that the only thing that they hired me for was the use of my hands, because I could engrave the wood and nobody else could.

01:13:17.558 --> 01:13:21.743
So I was feeling sort of put upon it, so I put myself as a swatty.

01:13:23.005 --> 01:13:25.147
And so stuck, I started doing it.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:29.392
And of course, the idea comes from Alfred Hitchcock.

01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:31.874
Of course, when you get yourself in it.

01:13:31.914 --> 01:13:36.519
Sometimes it's a significant character, other times it's less so.

01:13:36.699 --> 01:13:41.124
This is your hat and your helmet.

01:13:42.465 --> 01:13:44.928
This is one of my favorites.

01:13:44.948 --> 01:13:46.309
Did you illustrate this with Susan Leinart?

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.530
No.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.613
Susan Leinart?

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:51.595
Where is that?

01:13:53.819 --> 01:13:57.544
Oh, God.

01:13:57.644 --> 01:14:00.588
And describe the picture we're looking at.

01:14:00.628 --> 01:14:04.714
Well, this is a poor king that had nothing in his treasury.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:11.303
And we're looking at this guy who's one eye and got a pair of glasses on.

01:14:11.603 --> 01:14:14.647
And, well, I don't know.

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.530
I'm better at pictures than words in this thing.

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:19.674
But he's all squinted up looking at you kind of like, what are you doing?

01:14:20.835 --> 01:14:22.037
What is he up in here?

01:14:22.827 --> 01:14:24.629
Lynne Reed Banks.

01:14:24.769 --> 01:14:24.890
Good.

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:30.196
This is what I'm looking for.

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.399
Just to give me a couple of lines of description.

01:14:32.739 --> 01:14:37.425
And then... So is it whimsy for you now?

01:14:37.445 --> 01:14:39.628
Is it almost... Yeah.

01:14:39.828 --> 01:14:41.610
Oftentimes it's whimsy.

01:14:42.592 --> 01:14:43.673
And A Game of Kitsch.

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:45.095
This is Richard Wilbur.

01:14:46.076 --> 01:14:51.703
I don't remember exactly where I put myself.

01:14:52.612 --> 01:14:53.773
This is a nice little book, too.

01:14:53.793 --> 01:14:54.474
It didn't do well.

01:14:56.356 --> 01:15:05.126
Maybe I'm not.

01:15:05.146 --> 01:15:08.070
Maybe we found the rare book that Moser's not... Oh, no, no, no.

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:11.334
I know where I am.

01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:11.454
Here.

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:12.795
Inside the fire station.

01:15:12.815 --> 01:15:13.256
Wow.

01:15:13.316 --> 01:15:13.816
In a window.

01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:14.597
Behind the window.

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:14.858
Yeah.

01:15:18.702 --> 01:15:19.363
What year is that?

01:15:19.403 --> 01:15:21.165
Did you find them?

01:15:21.185 --> 01:15:21.285
Yeah.

01:15:22.312 --> 01:15:25.396
Well, that was my baby.

01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:27.599
Um, this is... What year is this?

01:15:29.962 --> 01:15:31.744
That was Katie who was called.

01:15:31.764 --> 01:15:32.786
No wonder it rang and rang and rang and rang.

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.688
She wouldn't let it go.

01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:35.349
1994.

01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:36.731
She fell down and scared.

01:15:36.751 --> 01:15:38.313
Oh, she didn't hurt herself.

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:38.713
Oh, sorry.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.476
Yeah, she was scared.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:45.663
And in this one, Donald Hall's When Willard Met Babe Ruth.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:49.988
A lot of baseball ones.

01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:51.390
Has been, yeah.

01:15:52.467 --> 01:16:01.360
I make an appearance here in this scene as an old baseball player hanging on the wall.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:05.245
Now, Rich probably has a bunch of these.

01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:06.888
That's what I'm saying.

01:16:06.908 --> 01:16:06.968
Oh.

01:16:06.988 --> 01:16:08.710
If I go to the gallery, I could find these probably.

01:16:09.571 --> 01:16:10.933
I don't want you to make a special trip.

01:16:10.993 --> 01:16:13.717
We might use a couple if you had them, though.

01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:16.061
They are colored, which is great.

01:16:16.081 --> 01:16:17.102
This is, did you mark it up?

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:18.364
Here's the one in Moby Dick.

01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:20.447
Moby Dick, which page did I have this book?

01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:21.208
438.

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:23.804
And that's the very first time I did it.

01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:25.686
That's the first what?

01:16:27.068 --> 01:16:27.248
Uh-huh.

01:16:27.289 --> 01:16:29.211
That character there.

01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:31.474
With a black beard.

01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:34.698
And here's another one, which is kind of funny.

01:16:39.405 --> 01:16:41.968
Oh, look at that one.

01:16:42.108 --> 01:16:43.050
Isn't that funny?

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:44.632
Yeah.

01:16:44.692 --> 01:16:45.593
That's great.

01:16:46.197 --> 01:16:47.579
This is Blue Jay and Swallow.

01:16:47.599 --> 01:16:48.580
What are you here?

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:57.932
This is Virginia Hamilton's When Birds Could Talk and Vets Could Sing, in about the same time, 1995, 1996.

01:16:58.433 --> 01:16:59.554
And Vets Could Sing.

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:02.138
Who's the author?

01:17:02.258 --> 01:17:06.703
Virginia Hamilton, Scholastic, 1996.

01:17:09.727 --> 01:17:12.651
This is a guy named, what is it, Firekeeper?

01:17:12.691 --> 01:17:12.951
Fire.

01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:15.715
Firekeeper.

01:17:16.015 --> 01:17:17.257
counter-model point.

01:17:17.277 --> 01:17:17.797
Oh, stop.

01:17:17.817 --> 01:17:18.999
Firekeeper's sister.

01:17:19.479 --> 01:17:23.184
That's terribly flattering.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:25.988
It's like how photogenic I am.

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:28.992
It has nothing to do with this whatsoever, but that is my daughter.

01:17:29.072 --> 01:17:33.538
That was right after I had a baby, too.

01:17:33.638 --> 01:17:36.942
Quite that down, you say.

01:17:38.504 --> 01:17:39.185
That's cute.

01:17:39.205 --> 01:17:40.326
That's got to be one of your dogs.

01:17:40.446 --> 01:17:41.368
Well, this is Rosie.

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:45.533
This is my beloved Rosie that died a year ago, October.

01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:47.795
This is her daughter, Izzy.

01:17:48.035 --> 01:17:53.343
Oh, so you did a... Yeah, Izzy's actually the author, or ostensibly the author.

01:17:53.383 --> 01:17:53.984
Who is Izzy?

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:55.386
Isabelle Harper.

01:17:56.207 --> 01:17:56.908
This is her daughter.

01:17:57.329 --> 01:17:57.749
Really?

01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:01.695
Do we identify her here?

01:18:01.815 --> 01:18:02.356
Yeah.

01:18:03.157 --> 01:18:05.941
And identify me, too, as, you know... And there you are.

01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:06.262
Yeah.

01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:09.166
When Grandpa goes to work in his room, my job is to take care of Rosie.

01:18:10.588 --> 01:18:11.950
This is a very funny book.

01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:13.933
How old was your daughter when you did the book?

01:18:14.217 --> 01:18:15.619
She was, I think, three or four.

01:18:15.799 --> 01:18:16.980
Three or four years old.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.261
She obviously didn't write it.

01:18:18.422 --> 01:18:19.543
She thinks that she did.

01:18:19.563 --> 01:18:20.284
But that's great.

01:18:20.304 --> 01:18:22.966
Yeah, but there was a collaborative exercise.

01:18:23.427 --> 01:18:26.170
Oh, this must have been a great book for you.

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.051
I love this book.

01:18:27.631 --> 01:18:29.513
I couldn't look at it, probably, as well, for a year.

01:18:30.394 --> 01:18:34.659
And when did Rosie... He went through his reward on October 18th.

01:18:35.159 --> 01:18:36.361
There he is, right over there in her.

01:18:38.123 --> 01:18:44.089
October 18th, 19... And who published this book?

01:18:44.407 --> 01:18:46.471
Last year?

01:18:48.756 --> 01:18:55.409
He was an old man, was he, in 1994.

01:18:55.429 --> 01:18:57.474
And the title is My Dog, Rosie.

01:18:57.654 --> 01:19:00.460
And it's narrated by Isabel Harper.

01:19:01.021 --> 01:19:01.862
That's great.

01:19:01.882 --> 01:19:03.546
And he's named after Roosevelt Greer.

01:19:03.566 --> 01:19:06.111
Isn't that great.

01:19:06.378 --> 01:19:08.420
I helped him dry off before I brush his hair.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.282
She hates his picture because she's saying that.

01:19:10.302 --> 01:19:11.484
She won't, yeah, she reads it in school.

01:19:11.504 --> 01:19:14.006
I thought you'd seen these guys after a foot, after a foot, after a foot.

01:19:14.026 --> 01:19:16.409
Roosevelt, Greer was named after Franklin Roosevelt.

01:19:16.429 --> 01:19:17.770
So it was accidental.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:24.458
I had a dog named Woody, and then I had a dog named Rosie, and I said, wait a minute, that's Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt.

01:19:24.538 --> 01:19:26.160
So that began the succession.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.321
That's a delightful picture.

01:19:27.341 --> 01:19:28.082
That's very nice.

01:19:29.623 --> 01:19:31.445
And that's the right scale, too.

01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:32.506
Excellent.

01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:33.027
Yeah, that's great.

01:19:33.192 --> 01:19:38.097
And here she is, reading his favorite story, you know.

01:19:38.117 --> 01:19:40.920
Oh, she must love that, huh?

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:41.681
Did you hear from her?

01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:43.764
Oh, I had her permission.

01:19:43.784 --> 01:19:44.985
Yeah, but she loved it, right?

01:19:45.005 --> 01:19:46.947
She loved it, yeah.

01:19:46.967 --> 01:19:48.248
Taking her outside to play.

01:19:48.349 --> 01:19:49.029
I didn't interview her.

01:19:49.049 --> 01:19:50.050
She's a collector, you know.

01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:50.691
Oh, yeah.

01:19:50.711 --> 01:19:51.832
She collects graphic art.

01:19:53.634 --> 01:19:56.277
She goes, in fact, I interviewed her at an ephemera show.

01:19:56.618 --> 01:19:57.338
Is that right?

01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:58.680
Yeah, that's where we set up.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:19:59.841
That's Woody.

01:20:00.631 --> 01:20:02.153
Woodrow comes along and he plays.

01:20:02.253 --> 01:20:04.076
Oh, you didn't get them all by name, huh?

01:20:04.096 --> 01:20:04.196
Yeah.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:07.241
And then Rosie, Rosie wasn't real smart.

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:09.565
He loses the ball.

01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:16.956
Woodrow finally kicked it.

01:20:16.976 --> 01:20:18.218
That's crazy.

01:20:18.238 --> 01:20:20.521
No, but for the art here, this all had to be original art.

01:20:20.721 --> 01:20:22.604
Oh, it's all facial photographs.

01:20:22.624 --> 01:20:23.125
Really?

01:20:23.145 --> 01:20:23.606
Yeah.

01:20:23.626 --> 01:20:25.769
I have a closet full of photographs that we make ourselves.

01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:27.091
A shot like this?

01:20:27.111 --> 01:20:27.211
Yeah.

01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:28.393
Well, no, there's that.

01:20:28.643 --> 01:20:32.448
And then there's this, and then there's this, and then there's a drawing in there.

01:20:32.468 --> 01:20:33.329
It's collage, really.

01:20:33.349 --> 01:20:33.990
It's collage, yeah.

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:35.672
And then you just throw it all together.

01:20:36.052 --> 01:20:38.936
And this one's kind of sweet because there's a nice little story about this quilt.

01:20:38.956 --> 01:20:46.605
This quilt was given to me by, Rosie didn't actually sleep on this quilt, but this was given to me by Truman Capote's aunt.

01:20:47.246 --> 01:20:49.389
It belonged to Truman Capote when I was a kid.

01:20:50.771 --> 01:20:50.851
Oh.

01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:52.553
And there's a vampire.

01:20:52.573 --> 01:20:53.073
Grandpa again.

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.917
But here, you see the image here, and then you see it again here.

01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:59.775
This image is being worked on on the table.

01:20:59.795 --> 01:21:02.959
Now, do you identify who you are in this story?

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.141
I don't know.

01:21:04.261 --> 01:21:07.466
I mean, in the course of the story, do you say what Grandpa does for his work?

01:21:07.546 --> 01:21:09.528
No, no, no.

01:21:09.568 --> 01:21:11.511
He just kind of suggests that it goes to his work.

01:21:13.013 --> 01:21:14.235
And is this your home here?

01:21:14.255 --> 01:21:14.816
No, it's not.

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:17.119
I had to make this up for compositional purposes.

01:21:17.359 --> 01:21:19.482
This is a house at Smith College.

01:21:20.744 --> 01:21:23.828
Because I needed something where I could get this over here and this over here.

01:21:24.027 --> 01:21:26.331
So you appear twice in this book.

01:21:29.116 --> 01:21:30.879
Yes.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:37.269
If, because this is a month away from being done, you know.

01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:39.213
You're on the cover of this one.

01:21:39.253 --> 01:21:40.074
A new puppy.

01:21:40.575 --> 01:21:41.536
Now, which puppy is this?

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:42.999
This is a puppy that didn't make it.

01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:46.685
This is a puppy that... Do you have a cat?

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.889
I have a cat.

01:21:48.909 --> 01:21:49.630
Tootsie is that cat.

01:21:49.897 --> 01:21:52.260
attacking my poor dog and she's got glaucoma.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.122
She can't see.

01:21:53.562 --> 01:21:57.127
I go crazy and I can't get mad at the cat because the cat's got a heart condition.

01:21:57.248 --> 01:22:02.735
You know, she's got a heart murmur and so you can't, you know, I'm going to be the cause of her demise.

01:22:03.697 --> 01:22:06.080
We have more medical conditions with our animals.

01:22:06.861 --> 01:22:09.305
They've been saying for eight years that it's going to kill her.

01:22:09.385 --> 01:22:11.067
She's been supposed to die for five years.

01:22:11.228 --> 01:22:13.130
This cat actually had a stroke.

01:22:13.671 --> 01:22:14.472
We took her to Tufts.

01:22:14.592 --> 01:22:15.574
I mean, we should see the bill.

01:22:15.594 --> 01:22:17.777
It's as much for the cat as it is for humans.

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.126
Look at that, yeah.

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.089
But she came back, and she's fine.

01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:23.290
We're supposed to give her medication.

01:22:23.331 --> 01:22:25.574
You can't because she'll bite your fingers off, so we don't.

01:22:25.734 --> 01:22:27.396
She's still alive.

01:22:27.656 --> 01:22:27.797
Yeah.

01:22:27.957 --> 01:22:31.301
They won't even give her anesthesia, but this cat is so venerable.

01:22:32.042 --> 01:22:34.726
She's been hit by a car and crippled, and she survives with the heart.

01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:36.388
My cat's Nick and Nora.

01:22:36.408 --> 01:22:37.850
Yeah, well, where's Big Molly?

01:22:38.992 --> 01:22:42.817
So how many collaborations have there been between Isabel and Barry?

01:22:43.197 --> 01:22:43.417
Three.

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:44.058
Three.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:48.304
So I knew Puppy, and my cat's Nick and Nora, right, were the other two?

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:51.012
What is this?

01:22:51.072 --> 01:22:54.758
I always get Scholastic, right?

01:22:54.978 --> 01:22:56.099
Are they all Scholastic?

01:22:56.119 --> 01:22:59.104
This one is kind of funny too.

01:22:59.124 --> 01:23:01.106
This one is dedicated to all of the dogs.

01:23:01.927 --> 01:23:06.714
Because Woody had just died, so there's Woody's collar hump.

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:11.521
So this is all of the dogs we've ever seen on this.

01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:12.963
This is 1996.

01:23:13.063 --> 01:23:15.526
And this is our new puppy.

01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:18.190
So here we are.

01:23:18.845 --> 01:23:22.811
The cats are hearing the news that we have a new puppy coming.

01:23:23.011 --> 01:23:24.633
There's Grandpa laying down, reclining.

01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:28.539
Jesus, he said, this one just sounded like this, I'm leaving, buh-bye.

01:23:31.723 --> 01:23:35.809
And Rosie sees the new puppy coming and, buh-bye, I'm out of here too.

01:23:38.953 --> 01:23:40.936
And there's the first of the self-portraits.

01:23:41.497 --> 01:23:43.059
And there's Izzy with a very bad hair day.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.305
Wish I'd done that painting over.

01:23:47.325 --> 01:23:48.767
There's Grandpa's legs.

01:23:50.148 --> 01:24:08.937
Yeah, this is the thing I'm talking about, I want to take a story beyond where it is, it's just that there's cats not mentioned anywhere in here, but they have already been in this book, so now it's this attitude that cats have, this nonchalance, and this, you know.

01:24:10.419 --> 01:24:13.624
The cat's in every picture in the book.

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:31.907
Who's scholastic?

01:24:31.927 --> 01:24:37.395
Are they their own or are they reading to somebody?

01:24:37.415 --> 01:24:42.362
They make a big mistake if they don't send them to me.

01:24:44.047 --> 01:24:45.569
You're like I'm supposed to say something important.

01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:47.872
At the end of the book, what the hell?

01:24:47.892 --> 01:24:49.154
You got libraries full of books.

01:24:49.354 --> 01:24:50.536
That's not going to be the end of books.

01:24:50.576 --> 01:24:52.379
Books are going to all be here.

01:24:52.419 --> 01:24:56.344
Well, but I'm taking part in a conference next year, ALA in Chicago.

01:24:56.384 --> 01:24:57.365
They've asked me to take part in this.

01:24:57.946 --> 01:25:03.073
And the theme is, are all libraries destined to become museums of the book?

01:25:03.194 --> 01:25:07.279
Every library is like a museum, and every book is an object.

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:09.442
Like almost a rare object, an artifact.

01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:13.648
Of course there will continue to be books, but are we...

01:25:14.405 --> 01:25:18.949
in jeopardy as some people... I mean, will the Bible be read in a computer?

01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:19.690
I doubt that.

01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:23.533
A hundred years from, I think the only way to read the Bible is probably as a codex.

01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:26.295
Well, I think you have two different experiences going on here.

01:25:26.736 --> 01:25:29.278
I... Let's walk in the kitchen.

01:25:29.338 --> 01:25:32.541
I desperately need a glass of water or something.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.402
If you don't buy any of this.

01:25:34.502 --> 01:25:35.863
There's a... What's the name?

01:25:36.044 --> 01:25:37.965
Octavo?

01:25:39.447 --> 01:25:40.087
Yeah, Octavo.

01:25:40.107 --> 01:25:43.450
Octavo coming out of Adobe, where this guy is...

01:25:43.919 --> 01:25:49.564
Downloading these books onto, let's see, a little bit of glass.

01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:50.605
Just water, anything.

01:25:50.926 --> 01:25:52.767
Do you want some ice in it?

01:25:52.827 --> 01:25:57.732
Nah, actually I'd like it just... This water comes 700 feet down.

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:58.493
700 feet, right here?

01:25:58.573 --> 01:25:59.554
Right through granite.

01:25:59.574 --> 01:26:02.977
Wow.

01:26:02.997 --> 01:26:04.018
Oh, thank you.

01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:08.702
And he's putting these things into digital, digital form.

01:26:10.284 --> 01:26:10.844
Putting books?

01:26:12.646 --> 01:26:13.707
That's a digital book?

01:26:14.648 --> 01:26:15.429
What do you think of that?

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:17.051
Well, you see, that's what I think.

01:26:17.491 --> 01:26:21.556
You're getting two different experiences.

01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:35.773
Myself, as doing some research or something, I think it'd be great for me to be able to go to one of the rarest books in the world and have it there on my screen and so forth and be able to sort of turn the pages virtually.

01:26:37.555 --> 01:26:40.238
That's one experience, and I think it has its place, has a value.

01:26:40.619 --> 01:26:44.183
But it does not take the place of holding that object.

01:26:44.821 --> 01:26:56.233
And I think the sensuousness of the object, the intimacy of the object, the turning of the pages, the warmth of that I don't think can be replaced by a machine.

01:26:56.613 --> 01:26:58.055
I did an interview for this new book.

01:26:58.335 --> 01:27:00.618
I have a lot of this in there.

01:27:00.798 --> 01:27:02.480
Those are things people can't get their hands on.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:02.820
He does.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.901
Right.

01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:04.762
That's exactly what I mean.

01:27:04.782 --> 01:27:08.866
And he digitizes the most scarce of all.

01:27:08.986 --> 01:27:10.047
And they're not selling, by the way.

01:27:10.088 --> 01:27:11.349
I don't know if it says it in this article.

01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:12.430
Have you heard that?

01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:13.211
Are they successful?

01:27:13.491 --> 01:27:13.551
No.

01:27:13.571 --> 01:27:14.372
I don't think they are.

01:27:15.483 --> 01:27:20.127
You know, there was a study done.

01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:21.128
Somebody told me about this.

01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:26.213
I can grab hold this corner, pull it over, and look, there you go.

01:27:26.253 --> 01:27:30.637
Is this the first project you use this kind of stuff with?

01:27:30.657 --> 01:27:30.757
Yeah.

01:27:31.157 --> 01:27:32.379
I mean, to this degree.

01:27:32.399 --> 01:27:33.400
What do you think of it?

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.001
I love it.

01:27:35.021 --> 01:27:44.730
It allows me to do what I have done throughout my entire career of making illustrations for books, except that it allows me to do it faster and cleaner.

01:27:45.436 --> 01:27:56.706
Is he off on the snowmobile?

01:27:56.766 --> 01:28:14.481
For instance here, if I do this again, I can take that bird up to this size, or I can take him up to this size, and I can do this in a second.

01:28:14.765 --> 01:28:16.347
And what do you call this particular act?

01:28:17.088 --> 01:28:17.929
Does it have a name for you?

01:28:17.949 --> 01:28:19.090
It's called transformation.

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:20.031
Transformation.

01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:22.794
Transformation command, yeah.

01:28:22.814 --> 01:28:24.456
You could do something like this.

01:28:24.476 --> 01:28:25.437
You even turned his head there.

01:28:25.877 --> 01:28:26.278
Oh, yeah.

01:28:26.378 --> 01:28:28.340
I can push it up this way.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.622
Computers, huh?

01:28:29.702 --> 01:28:30.543
Isn't it dazzling?

01:28:30.563 --> 01:28:31.884
I mean, it is.

01:28:31.904 --> 01:28:32.685
It dazzling.

01:28:32.705 --> 01:28:33.366
What you can do.

01:28:33.886 --> 01:28:37.651
And you actually are being an artist here, right?

01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:38.832
Oh, absolutely.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:48.621
These are photographs taken by other people, but you're manipulating them and putting them into a... Appropriating them, I think, is the challenge.

01:28:48.641 --> 01:28:52.967
That could do something silly, like get down here and make him just peep up over the top like that.

01:28:52.987 --> 01:28:53.708
Wouldn't that be funny?

01:28:54.809 --> 01:28:55.390
Oh, yeah.

01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:56.351
Well, that's great.

01:28:57.232 --> 01:28:59.955
And so then when you have something you like, what do you do, a printout?

01:28:59.975 --> 01:29:01.377
Then you just command save it.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:07.346
Then I print it out there and it comes out in those things I was just showing you.

01:29:07.406 --> 01:29:13.072
Then I transfer it to the block and I redraw the whole thing.

01:29:13.132 --> 01:29:19.619
So I finish this and I want to close it out and all I have to do is I actually have to go back to this.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.342
They're going to ask me if I want to save the changes and I say no.

01:29:23.023 --> 01:29:25.626
That's exactly the way it was when I came here.

01:29:27.192 --> 01:29:31.377
Now, did you basically do this with all of your pictures before?

01:29:31.397 --> 01:29:33.098
You're starting with something else?

01:29:33.138 --> 01:29:33.999
Yeah, always.

01:29:34.019 --> 01:29:36.382
I've always done this.

01:29:36.662 --> 01:29:45.332
I came across a word years ago in an article about David Smith, the sculptor.

01:29:45.532 --> 01:29:50.257
He referred to himself as a Brickoleur, and then a guy writing— Did you do the word slowly?

01:29:50.737 --> 01:29:55.022
Brickoleur, B-R-I-C-O-L-E-U-R, Brickoleur.

01:29:55.340 --> 01:30:00.710
And a guy writing in the Boston Herald translated it as a putterer.

01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:08.724
I had told him that it was a word that David Smith used, meaning that he was a user of discarded things.

01:30:09.486 --> 01:30:19.103
Well, Alan Mandelbaum's son, Jonathan, lives in Paris, and has always lived in Paris, and he translates French, technical French into English, or English, technical English into French.

01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.912
one or the other.

01:30:19.932 --> 01:30:21.619
So his son's also a translator?

01:30:21.739 --> 01:30:22.522
Yeah.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:23.425
It's a technical language.

01:30:23.445 --> 01:30:26.276
Yeah, but nevertheless, a second generation.

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:27.621
So I write him on email.

01:30:27.641 --> 01:30:29.970
So I got Jonathan's email, and I write him this.
