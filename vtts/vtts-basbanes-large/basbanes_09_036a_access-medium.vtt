WEBVTT

00:03.980 --> 00:06.424
We're talking to Dr. Oliver Sacks.

00:06.504 --> 00:08.947
I just asked you, Doctor, where you had your swim today.

00:09.168 --> 00:17.119
Oh, I went to the Central YMCA, which is a lovely, I would think a turn-of-the-century pool.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.787
And it opened at 5.45, which is my sort of time, because I'm a morning person.

00:22.807 --> 00:24.650
And so I had my swim.

00:24.670 --> 00:25.792
I did my 2K.

00:27.634 --> 00:30.378
You say in the book, incidentally, that you do all of it.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.560
It's got most of your thinking.

00:32.001 --> 00:33.683
You see all of it.

00:33.865 --> 00:35.707
Well, a fair amount of it.

00:35.727 --> 00:36.648
A fair amount.

00:36.728 --> 00:39.931
And I wonder if you could just pick up a little bit on that.

00:40.031 --> 00:41.532
Why suppose this is so?

00:42.053 --> 00:54.224
Um, well, I, um... I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:54.745 --> 01:02.792
I'm a New Englander doctor, so... Um... I, um...

01:02.890 --> 01:05.132
Are you comfortable in that chair?

01:05.653 --> 01:10.899
Do you mind if I just put this close to you, sir?

01:10.979 --> 01:11.359
Sure.

01:11.479 --> 01:16.405
Towards the end, I would like to shoot a couple of pictures, if that's OK.

01:16.425 --> 01:18.307
I have a number of newspapers of white color.

01:18.607 --> 01:22.412
OK, well, what I can put out, I've been watching a lot of stuff.

01:22.432 --> 01:25.014
I'm trying to put my shirt on.

01:25.094 --> 01:31.041
If you can move this whole thing, so then,

01:31.274 --> 01:33.556
I can face you properly.

01:33.576 --> 01:34.317
Okay.

01:34.337 --> 01:35.438
Is this fine here?

01:35.478 --> 01:36.399
Yeah.

01:36.419 --> 01:38.442
Okay.

01:38.822 --> 01:40.584
That's perfect for you.

01:40.604 --> 01:42.666
I get paranoid if I can't see you.

01:42.806 --> 01:43.627
Oh, sure.

01:43.647 --> 01:45.929
No, no, no, no.

01:47.651 --> 02:00.825
There's some sort of calming and stimulation and freedom and lack of self-consciousness.

02:01.092 --> 02:03.796
for me when I swim.

02:04.918 --> 02:14.593
And I think there's something about the rhythm which can get me into a sort of trance-like state.

02:14.613 --> 02:17.377
I find it very difficult to sit at a desk and write.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.622
There are no differences in the pool, is there?

02:20.662 --> 02:24.248
No, no, no.

02:25.730 --> 02:30.016
And there's, I don't know, there's some sort of mystical feeling, even in a pool.

02:30.096 --> 02:32.719
I mean, one feels a bit much more obviously in a lake or whatever.

02:32.799 --> 02:36.384
I'd rather swim as competitive as you can.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.368
Yeah, that's nice.

02:39.388 --> 02:40.910
I'm not competitive in the pool.

02:41.010 --> 02:52.024
I move at exactly the same rate, which is a metre a second, whether I swim for a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand.

02:52.544 --> 03:03.980
And I don't care whether other people are very fast or slower.

03:04.480 --> 03:14.434
I wish I'd got there earlier because the pool was almost empty and I could have sort of...

03:15.022 --> 03:24.715
I sometimes need a, you know, 20 minutes or a kilometer or a mile or whatever to get into the sort of trance, the trance space.

03:24.735 --> 03:27.259
It is, it is, you enter a zone, so to speak.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.144
Would you say you enter an intellectual kind of a zone?

03:31.164 --> 03:39.696
Well, I don't know that intellectually, I mean, it is another zone, another form of being, and a sort of timeless one.

03:40.013 --> 03:45.738
Do you become anxious if you miss the day of swimming?

03:46.018 --> 03:51.243
Yes, I become anxious and a bit annoyed.

03:52.324 --> 04:10.020
I mean, you know, I will survive, but particularly with this sort of whistle stop, you know, going all over the state, and the days get very clothed and frantic, so if I can at least have my solitary meditative swim,

04:10.523 --> 04:31.954
I was kind of amused to see in the little interview they did with you in the New York Times last week that you mentioned, by still carrying a green card, your status as resident alien, which you rather like, apparently.

04:32.495 --> 04:34.438
Well, I don't...

04:35.279 --> 04:37.662
I don't know where it works.

04:37.802 --> 04:39.224
Yeah, I don't know.

04:39.244 --> 04:41.767
Well, metaphorically, I'm not quite sure where I belong.

04:41.807 --> 04:45.271
And as a metaphor, it does appeal to me.

04:46.032 --> 04:51.799
And maybe see the other side of the anthropologist on Mars or whatever.

04:52.801 --> 05:04.375
Tell me a little bit about, it is a delicate balance, a fine line that you walk with when you leave the realm of dealing with an individual or the patient.

05:04.591 --> 05:13.581
Or this person is about to become a character in a literary work and enter the discussion?

05:14.222 --> 05:19.187
Well, first, this doesn't happen that often.

05:19.287 --> 05:30.700
One of the reasons I'm running late this morning is that I saw a patient when I came back to my swim and I very much want to

05:32.097 --> 05:34.780
you know, want to understand him, what goes on with him.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.081
I think he's a patient.

05:36.101 --> 05:39.445
I haven't seen someone quite like him almost since Awakenings.

05:39.866 --> 05:43.009
I think he has this very rare post-encephalitic syndrome.

05:43.570 --> 05:45.712
But he's not going to become a character.

05:45.732 --> 05:47.794
I'm not going to write about him.

05:47.814 --> 05:48.675
I don't think I am.

05:49.636 --> 06:00.248
And I don't quite know when the impulse to write may or may not sort of emerge

06:00.548 --> 06:03.472
or to write publicly, may or may not emerge at some point.

06:03.952 --> 06:05.474
I always write privately.

06:05.494 --> 06:16.848
I made some notes of Jockins when I was seeing him, and I think on the plane back, I'm going to sort of, you know, put things into more of a narrative, probably a narrative which no one will ever see.

06:18.190 --> 06:22.916
The narrative, for me, is first a way of organizing my own thoughts.

06:22.936 --> 06:25.839
Are you really conscious of literary style, however?

06:26.861 --> 06:30.505
I'm never, I'm never conscious of literary style.

06:30.653 --> 06:38.121
And yet I think style sort of enters all sort of style all the while.

06:38.281 --> 06:46.790
For example, in The Last Hippie, I think I just, at some point, I think I just quote from my hospital notes.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.334
I left the publication or whatever, and I'm not sure that they were.

06:50.955 --> 07:00.525
It was about his father's death, and I don't know if they're that different in style.

07:00.944 --> 07:04.148
Yes, right.

07:06.030 --> 07:11.156
So, sometimes things are just in my notebook, sometimes they're in the hospital notes, and sometimes they go further.

07:11.596 --> 07:13.298
Sometimes they're in the form of a letter.

07:13.779 --> 07:24.111
When I wrote about a man with Tourette's, the one I later called Witty Titty Ray, part of that consisted of a letter to a colleague.

07:25.192 --> 07:30.799
I sometimes have an explosion of letters to friends and colleagues before I write anything.

07:31.184 --> 07:36.670
And then if I write, I'd probably think of a letter to everybody, or a letter to anybody who's interested.

07:37.131 --> 07:39.033
I love the epistolary form.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.996
It's a lost form, almost.

07:42.657 --> 07:46.801
It's not a lost form, but it's a dying form.

07:46.901 --> 07:57.113
And I think it should be pointed out that you've dealt with thousands of patients over the years when it comes to writing publications.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.755
We're talking about a handful of people.

07:58.855 --> 07:59.976
Right, sure.

08:00.412 --> 08:16.431
But I guess I'm really interested in this line that you, you know, you've made the decision that this is a story that you want to share, that you want to write about.

08:16.451 --> 08:22.659
I think, for example, that's the sort of case of the colorblind painter.

08:23.300 --> 08:28.506
I mean, he first wrote me the letter.

08:28.526 --> 08:30.148
You know, he wanted to consult me.

08:30.533 --> 08:37.602
Yeah, it was marvelous, you know, and I saw him with a good friend, an ophthalmologist, friend and colleague.

08:38.883 --> 08:48.054
I think it may have been the vividness of his description.

08:51.438 --> 08:54.242
I'd never encountered total colorblindness.

08:54.322 --> 08:55.984
I'd never thought about a chromatopia.

08:56.324 --> 08:59.528
I wouldn't have thought it was that interesting or that profound.

08:59.862 --> 09:07.089
In a parallel way, you were also fascinated by creativity, since Matt Diddock and UNX Carmen.

09:07.109 --> 09:10.171
Yeah, or probe a number of things there.

09:10.432 --> 09:11.112
Absolutely.

09:12.574 --> 09:29.329
I think as you describe this nuclear sunrise, and sort of the beginnings of a whole change of value in vain, so that this impoverished, sort of nightmarish world started to...

09:29.984 --> 09:41.804
I rather like the almost chromatotic seat outside the window, a very, very delicate Chinese trees.

09:41.944 --> 09:50.158
I think I probably felt the first time that this man was a sort of treasure.

09:54.185 --> 09:56.008
What did you learn about creativity?

09:56.309 --> 09:57.831
I think it's still a great mystery for you.

09:58.051 --> 10:00.333
Does it remain a great mystery for you?

10:00.353 --> 10:03.837
Oh, absolutely, and I think it always will.

10:04.477 --> 10:11.204
I mean, so I don't know what to make of Stephen.

10:11.264 --> 10:13.446
I wonder about the creativity himself.

10:14.027 --> 10:23.076
I mean, I have a whole paragraph of those sort of rhetorical questions, and I can't sort of resolve them.

10:23.714 --> 10:24.956
Is that common, by the way?

10:25.056 --> 10:28.761
Are there always unresolved questions for you, unanswered questions?

10:28.781 --> 10:29.122
Yes.

10:29.522 --> 10:39.717
And everything that you've done, I hate to make a categorical sweeping statement, but I'm just curious, is there always an element of mystery that remains for you?

10:39.958 --> 10:40.919
I think so.

10:40.979 --> 10:45.586
I mean, one would say, you know, how come, don't I know all about Parkinson's?

10:45.606 --> 10:49.832
You know, what am I doing in the middle of a sort of crowded Boston morning?

10:50.533 --> 10:53.417
I still, sort of, 35 years,

10:54.207 --> 10:58.651
When I first came to the state, I worked in a Parkinsonian clinic in 1960.

10:58.671 --> 11:00.954
It was a neurosurgical clinic.

11:00.994 --> 11:15.728
35 years later, I still think that even Parkinsonism requires forms of understanding which I don't have and which I think no one has.

11:16.689 --> 11:20.333
When I saw the Parkinsonian article

11:20.633 --> 11:22.215
and I very much want to write about.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.418
I mentioned him just a little bit.

11:24.438 --> 11:34.852
He's the man in fact who treats himself with apomorphine and then suddenly says, you know, I've forgotten how to be Parkinsonian, which was quite amazing.

11:34.932 --> 11:46.286
You know, he added that 40 minutes later, he said, when the apomorphine wears off, he says, the dreadful knowledge of how to be Parkinsonian will come back and have to pack it on us.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.468
But when I...

11:47.836 --> 11:58.051
When I met him, I had the feeling that everything I'd written on Parkinsonism was sort of as thin as this interstellar gas.

11:59.112 --> 12:16.037
I'm not capable of it, but a 500-page book could be written about this man and about a day in his life, and it wouldn't be a word too long, because the reality is that big and that complex.

12:16.557 --> 12:21.665
and Parkinsonism is a lot of sympathy, you know, compared to something like Tourette's.

12:21.685 --> 12:41.738
You also mentioned that when you decided to go out and do these seven, that you actually became, you went beyond the clinician, and then you became seconding akin to an anthropologist, a field worker, and you actually had to go out and

12:41.937 --> 12:44.460
absorb their lives, I guess, become part of it.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.862
I wonder if you could address yourself a bunch of that.

12:46.102 --> 12:49.627
Well, this has been increasing with me over the years.

12:49.988 --> 12:52.170
Gary, thank you.

12:52.711 --> 12:54.173
His real name is Gary.

12:54.193 --> 13:03.706
The man I call Greg, of course, is in the hospital, and the same awaitance hospitalizing for 30 years.

13:04.527 --> 13:10.054
But I started with a particular point in 1976,

13:10.523 --> 13:21.217
when I was listening to a man with Tourette's syndrome, and he was describing to me various events and scenes on his eventful journey to me.

13:21.237 --> 13:32.532
And as I listened, I thought, I will never know what this man's life is like unless I go out with him.

13:32.552 --> 13:36.717
So I went for a stroll with him.

13:37.557 --> 13:43.245
and then later went for a car drive and sort of sat in the back of the car with a hoodie of tape.

13:44.306 --> 14:01.489
More and more, I need to see people in their own world, so to speak.

14:01.942 --> 14:06.166
No, but which I used to love doing cross calls with my father.

14:06.266 --> 14:10.349
He felt so strongly, you know, and the office was called the surgery in England.

14:10.449 --> 14:17.715
He'd see people there, but he wanted to see them in their homes and this and that.

14:17.875 --> 14:21.699
You said the family trade, by the way, I think was the name.

14:21.759 --> 14:22.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:22.599 --> 14:25.062
The family trade, it was my mother's trade.

14:25.202 --> 14:30.286
And all of us, I sort of carrying on.

14:30.306 --> 14:31.527
What was your mother's specialty?

14:31.743 --> 14:38.516
And she was a surgeon, a general surgeon, although both she and my father had some training in neurology.

14:38.636 --> 14:46.370
And I read someplace where your mother had three siblings who founded schools, is that correct?

14:46.390 --> 14:46.651
Yeah.

14:46.891 --> 14:48.073
What kind of schools were these?

14:48.594 --> 14:49.416
My wife asked me.

14:50.197 --> 14:51.440
Okay, all right.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.325
Well, one of them was a school in Cheshire.

14:54.878 --> 14:57.682
for what used to be called delicate children.

14:57.702 --> 15:07.234
But really the family was concerned in every aspect of it.

15:08.336 --> 15:11.460
The healing arts, shall we say.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.282
Yeah, yeah.

15:13.402 --> 15:18.229
And one art founded a school in Palestine, as it was then, in 1899.

15:18.629 --> 15:20.892
She was my mother's older sister.

15:20.912 --> 15:22.354
There was a huge sort of

15:22.773 --> 15:42.162
there were six children by first marriage and then 13 by second mother, 17 to 19, the young sort of huge, and then another school founded, another school, another aunt founded a school in London for what used to be delinquent children, things like this.

15:42.182 --> 15:44.705
And I interrupted, now we can get back to where we were.

15:45.126 --> 15:51.295
Okay, well, I, even with something like

15:52.051 --> 16:10.554
Parkinsonism, which one would say is a simple neurological disorder, a motor disorder, I, with the man whom I sort of saw today, I would like to see him in all sorts of situations, and even situations which I can't see, I want to be told about.

16:10.594 --> 16:20.826
For example, he, there's an amazing book called Ivan, Ivan Vaughn, a psychologist in England with Parkinsonism,

16:21.177 --> 16:25.081
And there's a common and terrible chapter in this book called In the Loom.

16:26.101 --> 16:32.067
And the, no, I can't follow a patient into the loom.

16:32.888 --> 16:39.233
I wouldn't want to, but I want to know the details of a life of Parkinson's.

16:39.253 --> 16:46.620
I don't think one can sort of begin to understand or treat him unless one does that.

16:47.301 --> 16:51.184
So I want to see the details of people's lives and

16:51.704 --> 16:58.833
to some extent, if I can without being voyeuristic or invasive or intrusive.

16:59.995 --> 17:09.708
And there's this delicate sort of thing as an anthropology where you're a participant or whatever.

17:13.293 --> 17:16.497
But...

17:17.168 --> 17:22.773
But it's a delicate business, and as you would imply, there's the danger of indelicacy.

17:23.534 --> 17:27.097
You know, when one doesn't want to sort of pry too far.

17:29.018 --> 17:35.864
And I will say I never, I hope, pry further than people, than I'm welcome.

17:37.025 --> 17:47.074
I sort of, in a way, wait to see what sort of welcome or space is allowed for me for penetration.

17:47.324 --> 17:49.047
I would try not to push too far.

17:49.547 --> 18:02.928
Is the connecting theme, obviously, maybe this is so obvious, that you could discuss a little bit about paradoxical fails, because you're describing these paradoxical fails.

18:04.190 --> 18:09.078
Well, whether there's really any connecting themes, I'm not sure.

18:09.138 --> 18:10.219
You know, these are seven.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.264
They were never conceived as a seven.

18:13.868 --> 18:17.232
These are pieces written at different times and different moods.

18:19.714 --> 18:42.880
But I do think in each case one sees how a life, an identity, that sort of fits the condition has been present.

18:44.277 --> 18:58.257
Let's start again.

18:58.317 --> 19:04.366
About the paradox?

19:04.386 --> 19:05.107
Okay.

19:05.227 --> 19:09.814
I would regard the paradox.

19:10.034 --> 19:13.339
I'd be the last person to

19:13.657 --> 19:19.163
to recommend or prescribe illness or misfortune or addiction for anyone.

19:19.663 --> 19:30.174
On the other hand, and clearly some people are just torn apart and devastated and embittered and ruined by what has happened.

19:30.194 --> 19:31.595
And I see plenty of this.

19:32.036 --> 19:38.563
But I also see sometimes unexpected strengths and resources being called out.

19:39.243 --> 19:42.887
And also at times, even as it were, aspects of the disease itself

19:43.171 --> 19:51.460
which can be positive.

19:52.982 --> 20:02.472
And I think the theme of some of these unexpected positivities, the possibility of drawing them out, is a theme of a book.

20:03.393 --> 20:11.102
Now, this may be, I don't say that the colorblind artist

20:11.673 --> 20:15.117
was a better artist for losing his colour.

20:15.657 --> 20:40.043
But what was so extraordinary was that although there was no recovery in a neurological sense, there was a recovery, or rather a

20:42.301 --> 20:54.778
a rebirth or renewal or reconstruction of his creative identity and his sensibility in the terms he now had.

20:56.140 --> 21:01.667
And I don't know whether to speak.

21:01.747 --> 21:11.160
I read, I mean, so he became a great

21:11.410 --> 21:14.193
black and white artists.

21:15.515 --> 21:24.566
And lots of people saw this just as an artistic renewal, but some... I'm sorry, yeah.

21:24.807 --> 21:26.909
I was going to dress formally.

21:27.430 --> 21:33.558
I'm like this, if I could ask you to explain, I understand him.

21:33.598 --> 21:41.147
Okay, but I've been so rushing around that I... Right.

21:42.308 --> 21:49.556
So here is a man who one would think has a devastating loss, especially for an artist in colour.

21:50.436 --> 21:59.986
But the loss for him is turned into a portal, into a new world, in what he regards as a privileged form of vision.

22:00.967 --> 22:06.713
So he is now more conscious of texture, of shape, of movement, of delicacy.

22:06.753 --> 22:11.218
He starts to feel he's in a refined world.

22:11.924 --> 22:19.113
and that the rest of us, so-called color normals, are being distracted by, you know, by something extreme.

22:19.394 --> 22:31.129
Can I say, pardon me for jumping in, and I want to get on the tape before I forget it, but I have the greatest respect now for Robin Williams' interpretation.

22:31.470 --> 22:32.091
Oh, you do?

22:32.251 --> 22:34.133
The gestures.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.137
I can't imagine.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.661
I don't know, whatever, it's very entertaining life or whatever.

22:39.681 --> 22:40.341
It's quite remarkable.

22:41.423 --> 22:41.543
Can I?

22:41.860 --> 23:09.049
You might address yourself to the larger question of what was it like to be, to be, to have a, I don't think you are a poging position.

23:09.350 --> 23:13.695
And you're used to analyzing analysis.

23:13.715 --> 23:25.190
How does it feel to have this procedure reversed, I guess, in the moment?

23:27.653 --> 23:32.880
I'm certainly prepared to be a case history myself.

23:32.980 --> 23:38.867
I'm, you know, under the sense my leg book is a sort of case history of, you know,

23:39.421 --> 23:50.655
I wasn't objected violently to the script.

23:50.795 --> 23:53.698
Especially because I didn't want to be a character myself.

23:54.459 --> 23:54.980
I said, I'm not.

23:55.080 --> 23:55.881
I'm outside this.

23:55.921 --> 23:56.702
I'm the author.

23:56.822 --> 23:57.323
I'm the physician.

23:57.343 --> 23:58.124
I'm the creator.

23:58.464 --> 23:59.425
They have a character.

24:00.186 --> 24:04.692
And they said, no, you know, you want to be a character.

24:04.912 --> 24:05.333
Okay.

24:05.353 --> 24:06.334
You know, you know.

24:06.374 --> 24:07.335
Now, please, that's for you.

24:08.058 --> 24:11.341
for both of us, for us.

24:14.284 --> 24:19.888
But I'm going to take out the tea bag before it exudes any more tannin.

24:23.311 --> 24:29.537
I spent quite a lot of time with Rob and I showed some patients in hospitals, as with Daniel.

24:30.338 --> 24:36.343
And I sort of didn't realize that I was the subject

24:37.133 --> 24:45.946
at the same time I feel ceaseless and minute, though I have a very sympathetic observation.

24:46.767 --> 24:53.578
And then as you say about the gestures, there was one day, with that picture at the back of the book, it seems to catch me.

24:53.758 --> 24:56.782
I think I have a penalty for getting things like this.

24:57.303 --> 25:01.790
And I was speaking with him, and he was like that.

25:01.810 --> 25:05.976
And he wasn't imitating me, but by that point he had really

25:06.158 --> 25:22.722
He had got and he had appropriated and taken into himself and incorporated my gestures and many of my mental gestures, some of my tones of voice and the way I thought and, as it were, some of my memories and my interests.

25:22.742 --> 25:26.948
It was very, very uncanny, like a sort of sudden clone.

25:27.829 --> 25:35.220
And at that point, we both felt it was necessary to keep some distance between us so that he would be free

25:35.909 --> 25:45.040
you know, free to sort of create a figure of himself in his own way and not any sort of duplication of me.

25:45.821 --> 25:49.765
And, you know, there's only, to some extent, a limited extent to see.

25:50.907 --> 25:55.072
I can't now even see feet in the name of the Doctor in a way.

25:57.014 --> 26:01.039
But it has something of me, clearly.

26:01.779 --> 26:03.942
I also read some ways where De Niro

26:04.293 --> 26:12.203
is really a totally different kind of, probably he didn't say anything or said very little.

26:13.124 --> 26:34.131
Yeah, I'm sort of rather frightened, or perhaps awed would be a better word, by De Niro at first, was intense, silent concentration, and one didn't know what was going on, and one didn't see the intermediate stages, as it were, the sort of robin was full of

26:34.499 --> 26:53.799
visible, audible, often very funny sort of experiments with identity in the scenes where De Niro sort of, I think so much of this went on internally and secretly and then this very profoundly considered sort of portrayal would come out.

26:59.865 --> 27:03.409
I think of even greater interest to me is not just

27:04.098 --> 27:16.661
your reaction to the way actors might respond to you, but the way playwrights have really looked at your work as perhaps the raw material of drama.

27:17.322 --> 27:18.003
Right.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.267
One second before I commit an impropriety.

27:20.602 --> 27:22.103
What is that for?

27:22.424 --> 27:23.885
I think he said it's yogurt.

27:24.646 --> 27:25.947
Yeah, I know.

27:26.288 --> 27:29.271
Do I put in my tea?

27:29.391 --> 27:35.437
I don't know what to do with it.

27:35.877 --> 27:37.579
I'll be curious to find out.

27:38.820 --> 27:42.023
I love this place.

27:42.204 --> 27:43.945
How is it, might I add?

27:48.530 --> 27:49.731
Delicious.

27:51.348 --> 28:08.454
Um, yeah, see, when Awakenings was originally written in 73, Alan Bennett was, whom I knew somewhat, and I'm, uh, was interested in those dramatic possibilities, but, you know, but didn't sort of do anything.

28:09.976 --> 28:20.612
I was, um, I was, uh, um, I was thrilled and

28:21.082 --> 28:23.966
I'm sort of overwhelmed when I saw when Prince had sent me the play.

28:24.947 --> 28:28.352
Amazing.

28:29.854 --> 28:44.433
And also this marvellous letter, which I don't know whether I quote it or not, when he said he'd read Awakens in 73, then he said he forgot it, and it sort of submerged inside him for eight years.

28:44.493 --> 28:49.620
And then suddenly he woke up one morning with a first image and a first line of a play.

28:50.191 --> 28:53.975
the first time something's happening, you know, and the whole thing then wrote itself.

28:54.796 --> 29:03.324
And I wish that Patience had been alive to see that.

29:05.086 --> 29:16.958
But I was also relieved from any embarrassment because Pinter's play, you know, such a radical creation, Pinter's doctor, for example, bears no resemblance to me.

29:17.319 --> 29:19.641
You know, it's not supposed to bear.

29:19.857 --> 29:27.689
How do we know where reality, what the line is, what imagination kicks in?

29:27.789 --> 29:34.039
I think Shakespeare describes it, you know.

29:36.844 --> 29:37.825
So I'm doing this wrong.

29:41.311 --> 29:45.477
We used to have a very nice music therapist at the hospital.

29:45.710 --> 29:48.153
who used to say, I love you, Dr. Satt.

29:48.173 --> 29:50.657
She said, well, I can't bear to see you eat.

29:50.677 --> 30:03.433
You know, and she would refuse to have lunch with me.

30:03.974 --> 30:11.404
A number of my newspapers like television.

30:11.424 --> 30:12.325
Very colorful.

30:12.423 --> 30:13.745
Well, it's nice, though, the flowers.

30:13.765 --> 30:16.228
See, I'm getting the flowers back there on the chandelier.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.429
Oh, good, good.

30:17.449 --> 30:22.135
And I'm trying to get a little bit active to come around.

30:22.996 --> 30:41.940
You were talking about... I love the fact that you really... There are a couple of questions that we're writing out of time, I guess, but you have really... The reviewer in the New York Times, I think, quite accurately observed that you have taken the case study

30:42.427 --> 30:44.949
You've really made it a literary form.

30:44.969 --> 30:47.652
Is it something that you have done mindfully?

30:47.712 --> 30:49.474
No, no, no, no, no, I haven't.

30:49.634 --> 30:55.480
And I'm sort of embarrassed and slightly annoyed when people talk about genres, which is never a word I use myself.

30:56.180 --> 31:00.124
And I didn't think of myself as a literary figure.

31:00.745 --> 31:12.096
I mean, clearly, one can be sort of, you know, disingenuous here and say, well, you know, I'm just telling a simple story and sort of relating the facts.

31:12.818 --> 31:40.446
I think I partly am.

31:42.687 --> 31:48.432
I grew up in a household of tales and medical stories and, you know, case histories.

31:52.616 --> 31:57.821
Well, let me see.

31:57.841 --> 32:00.463
This is, what, the sixth book I think?

32:00.503 --> 32:01.464
Yeah, I know.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.645
No, no, no, it's the sixth.

32:02.665 --> 32:03.926
No, no, no, I'm slowest.

32:04.226 --> 32:04.567
It's slowest.

32:04.707 --> 32:06.308
One, two, three, four, five.

32:06.368 --> 32:10.131
Okay, so it's been six, six, and a 25-year-old.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.833
So tell me about that.

32:13.130 --> 32:24.182
What news, what stirrings... How did it start?

32:25.463 --> 32:37.956
Well, I had written alternates, but really not published anything.

32:38.577 --> 33:08.179
Rebecca.

33:08.362 --> 33:22.355
I sort of had a pen and paper at hand almost ever since I can remember.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.497
I was called inky at school.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.521
That was my nickname?

33:29.842 --> 33:34.527
That was my nickname.

33:34.587 --> 33:34.867
I like KY?

33:34.947 --> 33:35.027
Yes.

33:36.239 --> 33:59.833
I was particularly fond of descriptions and sort of keeping journals and travel journals with events and people and places and a couple of relatively early things were published 30 years later when a magazine and peers wrote to me saying they had a special issue on journals and I gave them

34:00.472 --> 34:04.517
a journal, a notebook which I had written in the Canadian Rockies in 1960.

34:04.917 --> 34:11.024
There was a sort of day when I just lay in a meadow and wrote, and thought very much between two worlds.

34:11.084 --> 34:15.189
I had left England, I had left Europe, I thought I'd left medicine.

34:15.649 --> 34:20.094
I didn't know what came next, so it was this in-between point.

34:21.696 --> 34:25.821
They also published another one called Travel Happy, which was, I'd been

34:27.370 --> 34:28.171
I had a motorbike.

34:28.191 --> 34:32.936
I'd sort of been going and zigzagging around the country in Mexico when the motorbike blew up on me.

34:33.797 --> 34:42.385
And then I sort of hitched a lift with a truck and described life with these two truckers as a truck stop.

34:42.846 --> 34:46.409
The truck stop in Alabama was called Travel Factory.

34:46.429 --> 34:53.817
And now, in a way, I partly think this, as it were, this portrait of the two truckers and the trucking life

34:54.117 --> 34:59.364
was sort of precursor of some of the clinical sort of portraits which came later.

34:59.865 --> 35:12.583
So I think already some desire for this sort of chronicling and fitted into medicine.

35:12.764 --> 35:18.672
Although my first book really didn't indulge this too much, and it was very unexpected.

35:19.413 --> 35:22.858
I had gone home in the summer of 67,

35:23.581 --> 35:35.253
And I'd been in a migraine clinic for six or eight months, which, to my amazement, excited and stimulated me tremendously.

35:36.234 --> 35:44.782
And very suddenly, without intending it, I wrote a book.

35:46.224 --> 35:48.306
It sort of poured out of me.

35:48.708 --> 35:58.703
and I sort of sent a letter to my boss saying, you know, funny thing happened, you know, something took hold of me, and I wrote this book.

36:01.628 --> 36:17.652
The greatest happiness I think I've, in a way, ever known was when, in fact, that earlier version was partly abandoned, and then I

36:18.779 --> 36:19.500
I redid it.

36:20.642 --> 36:36.124
As a part of getting it out of my head and giving it to the publisher, on September the month, 1968, I started a month of happiness such as I had never known before or since.

36:36.485 --> 36:45.698
Because for the first time in my life, and against all the odds, I thought, I've done something, and it's real, it's not great, but it's not bad, and it's outside me.

36:46.302 --> 36:49.666
and it's potentially part of the world now.

36:50.427 --> 37:15.820
Has the response that has generated, has that surprised you, that people are so... Well, it surprised me intensely at first, and it surprised my publishers, and, you know, when... I mean, Awakens never had that much of an impact, although I think sort of, you know, it had a limited readership, we thought, sort of,

37:16.272 --> 37:18.936
Fine.

37:18.956 --> 37:32.157
But then you see, they had a print one of 3,000 or whatever, and that sort of sold out in a day, and suddenly it was on bestsellerness, and this happened out of the blue.

37:33.018 --> 37:36.684
And my publisher then, they said, it's just a fruit.

37:38.366 --> 37:44.676
When people will see the book doesn't live up to its title, they won't buy it anymore, but then they did.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.641
Do you see these?

37:46.961 --> 37:51.107
And it is interesting because we had a huge medical book last year.

37:51.207 --> 37:53.449
We'll do something.

37:53.470 --> 37:57.374
I'm fine, thank you.

37:57.575 --> 38:00.759
He's a marvelous man.

38:00.839 --> 38:04.303
I met him for the first time actually before that was published.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.186
I knew his earlier book, Doctors.

38:06.206 --> 38:10.852
We have the same literary agent as a matter of fact.

38:10.872 --> 38:14.376
But it is interesting that

38:15.217 --> 38:19.442
They are different stories.

38:19.462 --> 38:20.844
I mean, he writes about death.

38:20.864 --> 38:26.671
Your stories are uplifting in a way, aren't they?

38:26.791 --> 38:29.294
Oh, they are.

38:29.694 --> 38:34.700
He does tell us how we meet our ends.

38:34.820 --> 38:43.030
I am... I found How We Die very,

38:43.415 --> 38:44.096
terrifying.

38:44.116 --> 38:49.703
I was sort of, when I'm quoted on the cover, I was actually only partly quoted.

38:50.424 --> 39:05.163
One of the things I also said in the same letter to the publishers, I didn't know they were going to want to use a full blurb, was that I could only bear to read a little bit at a time, because it frightened me too much and overwhelmed me.

39:05.524 --> 39:11.852
I did read the whole book, but I'm usually a fairly quick reader, but that took me about two months, because I could only

39:12.119 --> 39:14.622
No, there's only so much I could take.

39:15.323 --> 39:24.333
No, I'm not asking you to contract those books, but I guess I'm reaching for the fact, the suggestion that these are uplifting stories.

39:24.353 --> 39:30.419
Do you agree with that assessment?

39:30.439 --> 39:40.911
Well, if this is toppled with the notion that sort of tragic and even horrible situations are sometimes described of...

39:41.633 --> 40:09.372
that the man who reverts to blindness and the, and the, you know, who is thrown into terrible confusion by the intervention, by the gift of heart, and, you know, and then struggles, and then reverts to a strange, ambiguous blindness, and, you know, and the last line of the last hippie is chilling, you know, I've never been to the garden.

40:09.692 --> 40:11.134
And yet, and yet,

40:11.536 --> 40:26.932
There is something, in each case these are individuals with different ways, with sort of chosen resource or courage or stoicism.

40:26.952 --> 40:28.614
So it is a book about surviving.

40:30.155 --> 40:32.638
Surviving, and they are instructive.

40:32.658 --> 40:33.198
Yeah.

40:34.700 --> 40:39.805
And I love the fact that you are interested in

40:41.607 --> 40:48.994
people like Rustoyevsky and Johnson, and these people from the past.

40:49.094 --> 40:52.156
I mean, we're not just focusing on these cases.

40:52.997 --> 40:58.162
You are giving us a little wider focus here, actually.

40:58.182 --> 41:00.784
Perhaps you could tell us how to test yourself briefly for that.

41:01.064 --> 41:01.164
Yeah.

41:02.005 --> 41:10.753
Well, the... When I was writing the latter part of Awakenings, a very strange...

41:11.915 --> 41:17.340
sort of grief-stricken and in so good state, it was immediately after my mother's death.

41:19.823 --> 41:24.707
In the summer of 72, I completed the case history.

41:24.928 --> 41:30.673
I had a little apartment in London then, and I would take them down and I would read them to her.

41:31.033 --> 41:35.438
She knew, at least from descriptions, many of the patients well on that.

41:36.299 --> 41:38.661
And then the latter part of the book.

41:38.941 --> 41:40.943
At that time, I could only read dumb.

41:41.429 --> 42:06.171
some reason done devotions and uh this is um i i mean this early 17th century sort of um it just sort of seems so close it spoke to my condition that seemed relevant to awakenings and you know diseases whole consultations and um but um in uh um

42:09.610 --> 42:25.731
I quote the case, you know, the description of Dr. North, this 18th century sort of master of the college who lost a sort of frontal lobe from a stroke and became a different sort of person.

42:26.211 --> 42:31.338
Are you familiar with the book that came out 15 years ago, Boswell's Clamp and Other Medical Essays?

42:31.699 --> 42:33.361
I saw it.

42:33.701 --> 42:34.923
Who wrote that?

42:34.943 --> 42:35.684
I can't call the name.

42:35.724 --> 42:38.267
It's pretty interesting.

42:38.483 --> 42:42.148
It is case-setting.

42:43.590 --> 42:47.174
No, I was saying something about Mozart and Tourette's.

42:47.194 --> 42:50.098
But I'll be happy to say, I've done it at home.

42:50.198 --> 42:51.420
Oh, good, yeah.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.141
Yeah, yeah.

42:52.161 --> 42:54.884
No, I don't think Mozart had Tourette's.

42:54.904 --> 43:02.715
I think Johnson did, probably did, as far as what could judge, from circumstantial evidence.

43:02.735 --> 43:06.760
And I mean, there's so, so much in him.

43:07.020 --> 43:08.322
He's hardly stepping over himself.

43:08.622 --> 43:14.247
touching every thick post and these strange noises that she used to make.

43:14.847 --> 43:19.031
And his hatred of imitation, which was obviously prone to himself.

43:21.693 --> 43:35.845
But one way or another, the voice of the past was so present.

43:36.205 --> 43:38.207
I mean, I...

43:39.065 --> 43:43.451
Mollinger's letter to Locke.

43:43.491 --> 43:47.096
You know, it says it was on a 15-year-old boy in 1728.

43:47.517 --> 43:50.561
I mean, those early figures perfused to see and not see.

43:51.082 --> 43:54.907
You know, I felt them all in my room with me.

43:55.367 --> 44:01.716
You know, and I sort of, I love this feeling of the ancestors.

44:03.138 --> 44:06.743
I gather there's no shortage of ideas of projects being worked on.

44:06.993 --> 44:34.688
the timepiece suggested a book on leprosy in any way no no no no no not a book on leprosy no i i i was in this strange in micronesia in the summer it's an island of the colorblind of a chromatophis and it's a good part of the population but also on this island i am i got a really tough sense of the many

44:34.904 --> 45:03.932
misfortunes which have been visited on this idyllic place from leprosy to spam to the ambiguities of religion I wouldn't want to say religion is like spam I'm a little embarrassed by that last sentence if indeed I ever said it because I met many noble missionaries and at the same time it's so complex

45:04.165 --> 45:21.204
So I do wonder about a piece on which it may have the centre of achromatopia on this particular line, the finger lap, but it may then spread out to a sort of thing on islands in general.

45:22.145 --> 45:33.598
Because I also looked at the radioactivity in the Marshall Islands and the destruction of coral reefs in Guam, and I don't know how far I will sort of go there.

45:34.355 --> 45:40.120
I read one thing that you'd love to write about this woman's astronaut.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.362
Would you like to travel into space?

45:43.503 --> 45:44.484
Absolutely.

45:44.624 --> 45:45.705
I would, myself.

45:45.725 --> 45:48.208
No, I would love to.

45:49.109 --> 45:50.049
I mean, I'm too old.

45:50.830 --> 45:54.313
My cardiovascular system wouldn't stand probably this and that.

45:54.774 --> 45:59.538
Besides, we ordinary folks don't get a chance.

45:59.598 --> 46:03.822
But have you seen any of these sort of IMAX films of the

46:04.274 --> 46:07.819
You know, and I was the nearest I ever came.

46:10.202 --> 46:33.792
Once I, in a freaky way, I had a Concorde flight from Washington, and the plane flew, I fell asleep for a little bit as we were sort of approaching, as the sun was setting, and was then woken by the sun and was sort of completely disoriented, and then I realized I was seeing the sun

46:34.430 --> 46:38.676
and unsetting in the West.

46:38.756 --> 46:41.259
And then I went into the captain's cabin.

46:41.279 --> 46:42.802
We were going unusually high.

46:43.302 --> 46:45.545
They used to go 50, 60 pounds.

46:45.565 --> 46:48.009
Yeah, and for some reason they were up to 68 or whatever.

46:48.169 --> 46:49.331
Really?

46:49.351 --> 46:59.124
And one got a feeling of the darkness of the deep blue and then the darkness of space and you could just see the curvature of the Earth.

46:59.144 --> 47:01.908
And it sort of altered my feelings.

47:02.148 --> 47:04.251
Some parochial and provincial

47:04.670 --> 47:17.746
was replaced by a sort of planetary feeling, which has stayed with me, and I felt then this is the nearest I will ever come to seeing the Earth as a globe.

47:17.766 --> 47:30.222
I know I have interviewed Buzz Aldrin, but I could never really get him to... This guy is a professional scientist, and he's thinking about what he has to do.

47:30.505 --> 47:34.389
I would love to get somebody to articulate.

47:34.429 --> 47:40.295
This is what Marcia does, and this is why I'm so taken.

47:41.356 --> 47:43.358
I didn't do that.

47:45.059 --> 47:47.322
I promise.

47:47.342 --> 47:48.743
Be sure to tidy up your beard.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.345
I'm the editor.

47:50.405 --> 47:52.226
I only set up a good one.

47:52.487 --> 47:57.812
How about if we... All right.

47:58.248 --> 48:01.312
This thing with the stuff.

48:01.332 --> 48:01.572
Yes.

48:02.313 --> 48:03.674
Say that again, please.

48:03.895 --> 48:04.175
Sorry.

48:05.016 --> 48:09.141
It was Auden's birthday yesterday on the project for us to focus in this.

48:09.221 --> 48:10.643
We always used to celebrate.

48:10.663 --> 48:11.664
How about holding the book?

48:11.684 --> 48:12.565
How about holding the book?

48:12.685 --> 48:14.768
I don't know.

48:14.788 --> 48:15.589
I don't know.

48:15.649 --> 48:17.671
It was a little too promotional.

48:18.773 --> 48:20.955
I mean, just the way you were looking, signing it.

48:21.095 --> 48:23.098
I don't know if it was emotional at all.

48:23.118 --> 48:23.378
Okay, then.

48:30.074 --> 48:45.197
That's a candid shot of you doing something.

48:46.860 --> 48:50.024
Would you like to set your copy of what I write?

48:51.166 --> 48:57.776
I just want to do a tape, tape and write right like that.

48:57.796 --> 48:59.018
Say something.

48:59.622 --> 49:00.959
Say, hey, puppy.
