00:02.225 --> 00:04.672
You think he's worth my seeing as a book collector?

00:04.692 --> 00:05.815
Is he a book collector?

00:05.835 --> 00:07.961
He's not really, to my knowledge, a book collector.

00:07.981 --> 00:09.766
He's an autograph collector.

00:09.786 --> 00:11.210
And I don't know how far you're going.

00:11.231 --> 00:11.551
Manuscripts.

00:11.592 --> 00:12.775
Oh, I'm doing everything.

00:12.855 --> 00:14.359
Autographs.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.302
Documents, you know.

00:15.422 --> 00:15.643
Yeah.

00:26.170 --> 00:30.395
I really need some people who are going to give me a little star quality.

00:31.056 --> 00:31.296
Yeah.

00:31.316 --> 00:32.398
This is a commercial book.

00:32.618 --> 00:35.802
Well, you know, an autograph should be a part of your book.

00:35.982 --> 00:37.264
Yeah, definitely.

00:37.284 --> 00:38.505
And he would be a very good one.

00:39.847 --> 00:41.489
I think he would interview you.

00:41.529 --> 00:49.179
There is a publicist who works for Forbes magazine that arranges his interviews and all.

00:49.199 --> 00:51.942
And so you can call up and make an arrangement through there.

00:51.982 --> 00:52.923
I don't remember the name.

00:53.204 --> 00:54.405
Well, I'll find it.

00:54.925 --> 00:58.208
I was interested, Liz Robbins used to be, I was reading some of the stuff.

00:58.228 --> 01:00.370
She's wonderful, Susan Abrams, yeah.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.231
They do what they do.

01:01.551 --> 01:02.272
She's great.

01:02.292 --> 01:03.473
I hope you get that.

01:03.493 --> 01:04.994
Yeah, I like Liz a lot.

01:05.275 --> 01:05.995
She's a wonderful girl.

01:06.256 --> 01:13.402
I don't want to take up too much of your time, because I've got lots of stuff here, but I also don't want, oh yeah, this is a very important question, and then you can go upstairs.

01:13.422 --> 01:14.543
I think you have to be up there by 11.30.

01:14.563 --> 01:16.805
I have to do it in another interview.

01:16.906 --> 01:23.852
Okay, but David Redden said he believes that we are, one of my chapters wrote,

01:24.355 --> 01:38.811
profile with what I believe to be the great golden age of American book collecting, starting with the wholesale of 1911, continuing with this 1912, which brought together, which is a perfect device to bring together J.P.

01:38.871 --> 01:52.227
Morgan, Henry Huntington, Rosenbach, the young Harry Widener, Bella da Costa Green, all these wonderful people, and then just kind of go forward to the current sale of 1929, when he sold everything while he was alive, knew something.

01:52.267 --> 01:52.607
Right.

01:53.195 --> 01:54.477
knew something and get out.

01:55.077 --> 01:56.960
He also sold all his stock, too.

01:57.621 --> 01:58.262
Great crash.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.323
That's the golden age.

01:59.343 --> 02:00.064
You can define it.

02:00.084 --> 02:04.490
You can bracket it by two options, which is why I can't do it.

02:04.510 --> 02:07.073
I'm going to start, however, with this side, and there are parallels.

02:08.034 --> 02:14.202
But Redden says he believes that we are now in the middle of another great golden age.

02:15.644 --> 02:17.166
And I said, how can you say that?

02:17.206 --> 02:18.948
He said that.

02:18.968 --> 02:19.489
He said, well,

02:20.077 --> 02:27.326
First of all, institutional money apparently has dried up, so you now have collectors again able to buy things for themselves.

02:28.187 --> 02:34.334
Secondly, I don't think any of us ever expected to see such wonderful things come in the market as they are now.

02:35.075 --> 02:35.795
Do you agree with that?

02:36.676 --> 02:41.242
Yeah, but it's paralleled in every other market that we deal with.

02:41.342 --> 02:45.146
You can make the same argument in Impressionist paintings or contemporary art.

02:45.607 --> 02:48.210
I think I was asking it in that context, not just books.

02:48.528 --> 02:50.831
Are we in the middle of a great golden age?

02:51.512 --> 03:07.914
You are, but it's a much wider and deeper market than it ever was in the golden age you're talking about, where you were faced much deeper because there are more people, more countries, more individuals involved today than there ever were before.

03:07.974 --> 03:10.677
The market is much more international.

03:10.697 --> 03:12.159
Let's not be vague about deeper.

03:12.179 --> 03:17.686
Deeper meaning more wealthy people or more people collecting?

03:17.706 --> 03:18.147
Both.

03:19.696 --> 03:22.560
Wealth has spread just as knowledge has spread.

03:23.521 --> 03:31.031
And today, you name four or five collectors, and if you're talking about the top things, that's where they would have gone in those years.

03:31.712 --> 03:38.181
Today, you can't do four or five, because the market out there is hundreds of thousands, depending on the level you're at.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.365
A guy like Manny wouldn't have figured in in the 1920s.

03:41.866 --> 03:44.229
He wouldn't have been a hitter in those leagues.

03:44.409 --> 03:45.571
That's right.

03:45.611 --> 03:47.053
And today, he's a hitter.

03:47.303 --> 03:51.229
But there are many more.

03:51.890 --> 04:09.355
If you extend this thing beyond just books, but if you extend this thing beyond books and start talking about paintings and furniture and all the rest of it, you have vast fortunes that have been made in all kinds of different areas.

04:09.836 --> 04:15.184
And instead of having the 400, you've got 400,000.

04:15.485 --> 04:16.966
potential clients out there.

04:16.986 --> 04:19.509
It's a very different thing than it ever was before.

04:19.749 --> 04:20.890
There is a golden age there.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.152
Sure there is.

04:23.172 --> 04:35.584
The supply of property is less than it was then, and what's happening is that the advancing in price is drawing more top-quality things onto the market, which fuels itself.

04:36.405 --> 04:42.210
Do you have a handle on why somebody will spend $40 million for Van Gogh or $20 million for de Kooning?

04:42.370 --> 04:43.011
My God.

04:43.295 --> 04:46.219
I mean, the jury's still out on this guy, for instance, isn't it?

04:46.319 --> 04:47.901
Not anymore.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.947
Well, does price dictate reputation?

04:51.987 --> 04:53.008
That's a good question.

04:53.068 --> 04:56.873
I think people vote with dollars, yeah.

04:56.893 --> 04:59.337
But reputation meaning in terms of enduring reputation?

05:00.398 --> 05:04.203
Well, you know, it's always been that way, anyway.

05:04.744 --> 05:12.154
Going back to time at Memorial, the things which have been worth the most have lasted the longest.

05:12.640 --> 05:25.498
and so I would think they've just voted on Jackson Pollock, and they have voted on Jasper Johns, and they have just recently voted on Picoumi, and they've all been elected to the Hall of Fame.

05:25.518 --> 05:30.585
Well, I think you're going to be elected to the Hall of Fame.

05:30.605 --> 05:33.008
Can I keep this?

05:33.208 --> 05:33.549
Yeah.

05:33.569 --> 05:34.710
Say again?

05:34.830 --> 05:35.692
The Streeter.

05:36.473 --> 05:40.318
The Streeter collection, which we sold in the 70s in Port Brunette,

05:40.535 --> 06:05.277
uh-huh it was a great great book collection it was seven volumes really and tom streeter when he died left a bequest to institutions around the united states which somehow came due at the time the auctions were planned so here's a plan for a library that was unbelievable his son frank streeter you can find it at the whitney company new york cd whitney yeah and frank streeter

06:05.662 --> 06:07.524
Maybe we could talk to him about his playa.

06:07.544 --> 06:09.006
He's a bibliophile himself.

06:09.066 --> 06:10.268
He was at this sale the other night.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.651
He was at this garden sale.

06:12.671 --> 06:12.811
Really?

06:12.831 --> 06:13.432
Frank Streeter.

06:13.492 --> 06:14.153
Frank Streeter.

06:14.353 --> 06:15.494
That's another good one for you.

06:15.514 --> 06:18.899
That's one of the great book collections.

06:18.919 --> 06:19.800
This is fun, you know.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.040
Yeah.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.041
This is lots of fun.

06:21.061 --> 06:26.628
If you're going to like this book, I'm going to send you some things that I wrote.

06:27.510 --> 06:27.810
Okay.

06:28.811 --> 06:28.991
Terrific.

06:29.011 --> 06:29.692
I better move on.

06:29.712 --> 06:31.354
Oh, how about signing my book?

06:31.374 --> 06:31.855
Oh, I'd love to do that.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.993
I've obtained something for myself.

06:42.856 --> 06:46.019
Are there some... I don't accept gifts, for example.

06:46.299 --> 06:52.566
Are there some men at the clock who do endorse products?

06:52.586 --> 06:53.447
I don't think so.

06:54.008 --> 06:58.053
I don't think so, but I give you an idea.

06:58.213 --> 07:03.198
I wouldn't... I don't accept gifts.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.521
There are people who love you because you're a pastor.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.165
Say, hey, I'd like to give you some money for yourself.

07:10.225 --> 07:17.054
Well, in the old days, you'd have a small little town, and maybe that's the way the pastor lived.

07:17.295 --> 07:18.917
That's true, that's true.

07:19.358 --> 07:21.400
But it's a different world today.

07:21.420 --> 07:27.849
We pastors are given a salary, and I'm speaking more from somebody saying, well, I want to give you my home and $100,000.

07:28.330 --> 07:31.975
But I'm like, no, I can't do that, won't do that.

07:32.415 --> 07:37.903
You mentioned on page 123, I believe it is, according to it.

07:38.423 --> 07:41.266
that you felt commissioned to evangelize the world.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.707
Were you written figuratively there?

07:43.167 --> 07:43.367
No.

07:43.568 --> 07:45.790
Or is it your mission to evangelize the world?

07:46.450 --> 07:48.993
Evangelize means to preach the gospel to every person.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.694
To four or five billion people?

07:50.794 --> 07:54.698
Yes, and that doesn't mean that I will achieve it, but that's my goal.

07:56.059 --> 08:06.068
I want to, through television, radio, sending out graduates from Liberty University, missionaries, pastors, challenging churches to world missions,

08:06.807 --> 08:11.192
I would like to, in my generation, see the world evangelized, and I'd like to be a part of it.

08:11.652 --> 08:15.657
Could you define what it means to evangelize?

08:15.677 --> 08:28.671
Evangelize means to share the gospel, the message of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, and salvation by belief in Christ with every person, to make Christ available to every person.

08:28.691 --> 08:36.780
You can't coerce anyone to become a Christian, but evangelism is to make Christ available to everyone.

08:37.520 --> 08:47.672
does to evangelize a new birth, does it imply or does it require the teachings of Christ or are there any other major?

08:47.792 --> 08:52.798
Well, as a Christian minister... In the world of religions, that would be equally appropriate.

08:52.818 --> 09:04.733
As a Christian minister, I believe that Christ exclusively, John 14, 6, is the way, the truth, the life, that no man comes to the Father but by Him.

09:05.734 --> 09:06.615
And I therefore...

09:07.777 --> 09:14.407
do not preach that Christ is a way, but that he's the only way.

09:14.427 --> 09:33.615
Some people have, perhaps, a misconception, but I think that when the moral majority was first being identified and flexing his muscles, which was considerably absurd, there was a sense among some people that there was an either you're with us or against us,

09:34.152 --> 09:39.617
I certainly did not intend for that to be out.

09:40.578 --> 09:47.964
But it is very possible because at the time when Moral Majority was started, we were on the outside looking in.

09:49.426 --> 09:55.311
Evangelical Christians were primarily, were much like the black church of 30 years ago.

09:55.331 --> 09:59.855
40 years ago, we were outside.

09:59.915 --> 10:01.737
We were knocking on the door very hard.

10:02.077 --> 10:02.978
We were very strident.

10:04.190 --> 10:05.271
We're equal partners now.

10:05.291 --> 10:05.812
We're inside.

10:05.852 --> 10:06.733
We're seated at the table.

10:08.415 --> 10:09.957
It isn't necessary to be strident anymore.

10:11.098 --> 10:13.281
And at the time it was.

10:13.741 --> 10:20.830
When you are strident and when you are aggressive, it is very easy for people to get the idea these guys want to take over.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.731
They want to own the place.

10:22.552 --> 10:28.018
But in reality, you just want a voice and equal influence.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.142
So you would say that's not the case, therefore.

10:31.510 --> 10:34.513
There is certainly plenty of room for it.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.475
For everyone.

10:35.595 --> 10:37.096
For everyone.

10:37.116 --> 10:48.489
And you do, towards the back of the book, you do have a list of things that you support, and I think it's kind of a position paper that's not very interesting.

10:48.509 --> 10:50.712
I think we have to go over it to get there.

10:54.697 --> 10:54.797
Okay.

10:54.817 --> 10:57.720
I'm sorry, I don't have anything to share with you here.

10:59.641 --> 11:02.023
I'm going to have dinner with my wife and two little girls.

11:02.724 --> 11:03.364
How old are the girls?

11:03.885 --> 11:05.346
The girls are six and five.

11:05.747 --> 11:06.747
Six and five, that's great.

11:07.548 --> 11:07.868
Great.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.571
They're the joy, aren't they?

11:10.591 --> 11:11.392
Oh, boy, aren't they?

11:11.412 --> 11:12.453
They're the future.

11:12.513 --> 11:14.935
I have a 25-year-old son now who's a lawyer and just got married.

11:15.555 --> 11:17.177
He did a lot of the research apparently.

11:17.197 --> 11:17.878
Oh, I couldn't double that.

11:18.158 --> 11:19.219
He's so bright, you know.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.661
He's just brighter than I am.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.081
And he is.

11:22.121 --> 11:22.782
He's just brilliant.

11:23.122 --> 11:29.428
And it makes you feel real good when you have a kid who starts where you are

11:29.864 --> 11:32.588
Did you write all this?

11:32.608 --> 11:47.468
I had to because, you know, unlike I had a professional editor, but not a professional writer, simply because people know how I talk.

11:47.488 --> 11:49.571
And I talk so much publicly.

11:49.611 --> 11:51.493
Anybody pick the book and say, Jerry, you didn't say that.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.396
That's not you.

11:53.416 --> 11:56.580
So I had to dictate every bit of it on tape, and Mel White,

11:57.590 --> 11:59.092
out in Southern Cal helped me.

11:59.172 --> 12:06.462
He spent, I paid him a lot of money with his staff to take all those tapes every day and put them together, kind of bring them to me.

12:07.303 --> 12:08.505
But I had to do it myself.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.608
A lot of work there.

12:10.628 --> 12:12.590
It's well written.

12:12.610 --> 12:14.613
The language is used well as a critic.

12:16.456 --> 12:18.058
Thank you.

12:18.078 --> 12:19.279
Well, that's why I asked.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.881
Where do you go to church today?

12:21.522 --> 12:22.904
I'm a Greek Orthodox.

12:22.924 --> 12:23.665
Greek Orthodox.

12:24.486 --> 12:26.449
Mark is, Dimash is really

12:26.817 --> 12:27.578
Demosthenes.

12:29.260 --> 12:37.130
And his father was on my board who died in 79, Arthur Demos.

12:38.132 --> 12:43.198
He started the National Liberty Corporation, about five insurance companies.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.102
He died in 53, a very young man.

12:46.462 --> 12:53.351
He marks one of seven children who now are responsible for all of that.

12:54.032 --> 12:56.335
He's a graduate of Liberty University.

12:56.568 --> 13:06.458
school that I'm chancellor of and my administrative assistant, but he's a very successful young man.

13:07.158 --> 13:13.084
You mentioned that you talk to God every day and that the structure of the prayer is irrelevant.

13:14.506 --> 13:14.746
Yes.

13:14.806 --> 13:15.507
Is that correct?

13:15.527 --> 13:17.148
Yes, just fellowship with the Lord.

13:17.168 --> 13:20.531
To me, it's prayer, my talking to God.

13:21.252 --> 13:22.153
Conversationally?

13:22.370 --> 13:22.670
Yes.

13:22.771 --> 13:24.353
Do you open it formally, though?

13:24.373 --> 13:25.575
Oh, yes, I do.

13:25.715 --> 13:27.618
Do you say, dear God, this is Jerry?

13:27.638 --> 13:29.200
I don't, he knows who I am.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.543
Do you think he's privy to every thought?

13:31.563 --> 13:31.964
I do.

13:31.984 --> 13:34.467
And he's privy to this conversation?

13:34.507 --> 13:36.530
Right now, right now.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.073
And every conversation that's going on?

13:38.093 --> 13:38.453
I think so.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.818
He's God and therefore omniscient.

13:41.838 --> 13:47.606
And I personally believe that he's as intimate as we'll let him be in our lives.

13:48.087 --> 13:50.250
And I just take everything, my children,

13:51.040 --> 13:59.270
All three of them are successful, but it's because my wife and I really prayed over them, even when they were away from us in medical school, law school, whatever.

14:00.031 --> 14:08.281
Just every day, by name, by need, this test they're going to take today, this tough exam they're facing tomorrow, the bar exam, and all.

14:08.421 --> 14:11.565
You don't ask God to help them pass the test, do you?

14:11.885 --> 14:13.607
I ask the Lord to help them remember.

14:14.869 --> 14:16.211
And do their best.

14:16.231 --> 14:16.891
And do their best.

14:17.432 --> 14:20.676
I'm offended when I see a... God doesn't bless law...

14:20.808 --> 14:21.729
to win.

14:22.149 --> 14:25.953
That seems to defeat the purpose of competition.

14:25.973 --> 14:26.214
Sure does.

14:26.894 --> 14:27.695
No, that's not it.

14:28.756 --> 14:29.417
Do your best.

14:30.438 --> 14:32.300
Do the best you're capable of doing.

14:32.340 --> 14:33.461
No less.

14:36.124 --> 14:40.569
You come across as a good old Southern storyteller.

14:41.350 --> 14:45.294
Is that important for a preacher to have this gift of gab?

14:45.394 --> 14:45.915
I think so.

14:46.896 --> 14:49.178
I didn't always have it, but it certainly

14:50.238 --> 14:51.079
to communicate.

14:52.420 --> 15:08.336
The average audience can only concentrate a few minutes, national or otherwise, and you need to break it real often and punctuate with stories and go back and emphasize principle.

15:08.356 --> 15:13.140
A fellow who thinks that somebody's listening to them for an hour unbroken is just conceited.

15:13.160 --> 15:13.861
Nobody's doing that.

15:14.041 --> 15:14.742
You're not that good.

15:16.303 --> 15:17.865
I find it very interesting in the

15:18.622 --> 15:25.709
He's been a lifelong alcoholic.

15:25.729 --> 15:28.953
And his father was an alcoholic.

15:28.973 --> 15:37.922
And he has two daughters, one of whom is also an alcoholic, and another who is married with him.

15:37.942 --> 15:41.406
But he's been okay for a couple years now.

15:41.426 --> 15:45.490
But he has just written and sold the book to the Crown Publishers.

15:46.043 --> 15:48.566
on adult children of alcoholics.

15:49.548 --> 15:55.696
And it's very interesting how being this child of an alcoholic has affected your life.

15:56.497 --> 16:04.988
And clearly, this has had something that there has been a similar eternity in your life, I can gather.

16:05.008 --> 16:05.769
I've got it from the book.

16:05.789 --> 16:05.869
Yes.

16:05.889 --> 16:06.430
Is that correct?

16:06.450 --> 16:07.852
It has, my quote, an alcoholic.

16:08.893 --> 16:11.777
Except it turned me against alcohol.

16:11.797 --> 16:12.658
So I sort of get to it.

16:13.634 --> 16:15.237
And I literally hated this stuff.

16:15.257 --> 16:19.825
Would you have been a man of God, had that not been a fact of your life?

16:20.727 --> 16:29.623
I would have, but if I had never become a Christian, I would not have used alcoholic beverages.

16:30.404 --> 16:31.526
I saw what it did to him.

16:33.169 --> 16:38.258
And just plain common sense, I wouldn't have done it.

16:40.178 --> 16:43.182
Do you see that as having been a teaching exercise?

16:43.203 --> 16:48.510
I mean, is that something that happened to your benefit, or I wonder?

16:50.333 --> 16:54.840
You know, I don't like to say that the pain of my father was for my good.

16:55.821 --> 16:56.462
But it worked out?

16:56.482 --> 16:57.884
But it worked out that way, yes.

17:01.009 --> 17:01.530
Yes, I do.

17:02.892 --> 17:04.935
What's the greatest crisis facing us today?

17:04.955 --> 17:07.899
I guess we can wrap it up very shortly.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.021
Well, we have two.

17:09.305 --> 17:20.459
crises, I think that, as I see it right now, we have little chance of dealing with it.

17:20.479 --> 17:21.720
One is the AIDS crisis.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.622
It is out of control.

17:23.483 --> 17:24.664
Awful.

17:27.007 --> 17:32.414
Surgeon General says he sees no vaccine in this century.

17:32.434 --> 17:37.540
Dr. Cook further says that 100 million people will be dead by the time of the century, worldwide.

17:38.684 --> 17:41.708
And then he says it's exponential.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.611
He said that to me personally.

17:43.631 --> 17:44.593
100 million?

17:44.613 --> 17:44.873
Dead.

17:45.334 --> 17:46.956
By the year 2000.

17:46.976 --> 17:49.860
100 million dead.

17:49.880 --> 17:50.822
And then he said it's exponential.

17:52.344 --> 17:55.008
And no, he said, I see no vaccine in this century.

17:57.592 --> 17:58.433
That's an awful thought.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.955
That doesn't mean there won't be one.

18:00.276 --> 18:04.302
But at the moment, he doesn't see it.

18:04.322 --> 18:06.665
That's where Christians ought to be praying for a breakthrough.

18:07.406 --> 18:08.067
We need a miracle.

18:08.705 --> 18:15.052
We need every person in the world who believes in prayer should be prayed.

18:15.072 --> 18:18.735
That is, nothing has ever happened to humanity.

18:18.755 --> 18:21.778
Only 50 million died in World War II.

18:22.459 --> 18:25.422
I mean, you know, we have about 100 million people.

18:25.442 --> 18:29.426
50 million, the worst war ever fought, died.

18:30.948 --> 18:37.935
And secondly, at the present moment, I do not see any way

18:38.962 --> 18:48.275
to prevent the Soviet-Cuban expansionism in this hemisphere.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.236
Nicaragua is gone.

18:50.078 --> 18:51.680
Cuba is gone.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.601
It's a matter of time.

18:53.963 --> 18:57.488
El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, et cetera.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.372
Panama, Mexico.

19:02.034 --> 19:05.980
So it's the government old theory is actually 80s style.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.243
I see it in the 90s with Reagan out.

19:10.450 --> 19:21.142
I can only hope that someone will be strong enough to do what needs to be done, and it's very unpopular.

19:21.202 --> 19:27.510
Nobody wants war, nobody, and yet we have our head in the same.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.233
Once it has happened, it'll happen so quickly.

19:32.295 --> 19:38.382
And suddenly, we have scores of millions crossing the border into this country.

19:39.847 --> 19:43.631
And we know what that does here in every area to us.

19:45.012 --> 19:53.480
And then we have hostile neighbors, armed, hostile neighbors, next door.

19:53.500 --> 20:05.932
And like Poland, like the Eastern Bloc nations, it becomes a matter of time until the country is infiltrated, subverted, and overthrown.

20:05.952 --> 20:09.415
You're a young man, you're in the 50s, 50s, 3, 4, 4.

20:10.998 --> 20:28.580
I hope I have motivated and am motivating a younger generation.

20:28.760 --> 20:37.090
We have 8,000 students at the university, a large political science major, to carry it on.

20:38.842 --> 20:50.979
To make a lasting mark, my greatest possible contribution is to train thousands of young people who will be here when I'm gone with the message and the motivation to say what needs to be said.

20:52.261 --> 21:00.752
So I have to stop now from what I'm doing as a one-man army out there and go back and train the young people.

21:00.832 --> 21:02.415
I think I'll wrap it up there, sir.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.256
Thank you very much.

21:04.017 --> 21:05.459
You're welcome.

21:05.479 --> 21:07.381
I'm going to kindly inscribe this for me.

21:07.401 --> 21:07.802
I will.
