00:02.883 --> 00:32.586
and it's now recording in the other direction which is fabulous so I mean so for me I mean that is if I were ever well one of the things that helped me most in this book is conversations with a former BU student and her sister I'll get in touch with one of both of whom believed that the songs were not

00:35.519 --> 00:37.642
I don't want to put this, were not defective.

00:37.762 --> 00:43.291
Certain of the songs that have most mattered to me seemed to me to have something very wrong with them.

00:43.691 --> 00:50.241
I didn't like having a sense that there was something wrong with them, though it was, of course, argumentatively convenient.

00:50.702 --> 00:57.532
That is, in a funny way, it's a good idea if you're writing a book about Dylan to say, not of course that he's always great, take such and such and such and such.

00:57.552 --> 01:01.999
And I had particular, One Too Many Mornings, I think is a wonderful song, and I had always

01:02.266 --> 01:03.988
resisted the middle stanza.

01:04.008 --> 01:06.692
I'd always thought there was something wrong with the middle verse.

01:06.972 --> 01:13.421
Conversations with these people rather slowly persuaded me that I was not really attending to the middle.

01:13.481 --> 01:16.446
That is, I was laying it as a charge against the middle verse.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.550
What is, if you see it under a certain aspect, not a charge at all?

01:19.570 --> 01:20.411
It's a truth about it.

01:20.852 --> 01:24.737
It's a true description from which I have deduced a false judgment.

01:24.757 --> 01:32.087
That is, there's something terribly flat about I gaze back to the room where my love and I have lain,

01:32.422 --> 01:37.767
There's something very flat about that whole middle verse.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.589
It was quite different from the first and the third.

01:39.989 --> 01:41.931
And I had just assumed it had gone flat.

01:42.151 --> 01:44.854
No, I think they were right to argue this with me.

01:44.874 --> 01:49.939
It had been gone flat in some demerit way.

01:50.619 --> 01:54.583
It was about a terrible numbness which overtakes the middle.

01:54.643 --> 01:59.728
And it just goes, and, and, and, and we're both just walking away.

02:00.856 --> 02:09.788
The human situation is to recover from that at the end, into something which is still sad, but is not completely drained and empty.

02:09.908 --> 02:15.737
There's a kind of funny life coming, a different kind of life in the middle stanza from in the two others.

02:16.157 --> 02:27.673
One final question, maybe even two, I know we've been weighing, but Shakespeare's been around for close to what, 1623 or whatever, and the play's 400 years or whatever?

02:28.092 --> 02:40.168
400 years from now, do you believe that Dylan, even if we don't have the music, we don't have the performance, does the material endure as a text?

02:40.188 --> 02:43.412
Well, I... Oh, without the music.

02:43.452 --> 02:44.153
Without the music.

02:44.413 --> 02:50.681
I guess I'm also asking if the music is a necessary monument of the work of art, I guess.

02:50.722 --> 02:54.927
Well, I think that it is... I think it would be a bit like saying,

02:55.700 --> 03:02.086
If you had only the screenplay for Citizen Kane, would people be able to realise when they filmed it?

03:02.106 --> 03:06.871
I've never seen King Lear in performance, for instance, but I've read it... Yeah, yeah.

03:06.951 --> 03:15.719
Well, I think... I think... I think there is a difference... I think there is a difference between... How to undergo this?

03:16.400 --> 03:21.425
I don't think... It's tricky.

03:22.026 --> 03:24.508
I don't quite want to say proportions,

03:24.910 --> 03:31.519
because I don't think that hydrogen is more important than oxygen in water because there's twice as much of it.

03:31.879 --> 03:39.529
That is, it's a particular compound by which the oxygen is just as important as the hydrogen, and there's only half as much oxygen.

03:41.151 --> 03:54.529
So I don't quite want to say, as it were, extent of what's wonderful about Dylan is in the words, because it is a combination of a particular cadence which on the page is inaudible.

03:54.948 --> 04:04.197
On the page it's inaudible, and it's perfectly fine that it's inaudible, because the cadencing was created by the voice in the music, not by the words alone.

04:04.877 --> 04:15.347
That is, especially poems since the printing press, or poems that are not directly for an oral condition, you hear them in the theatre of your head, but you read the way they stand on the page.

04:15.788 --> 04:21.613
Wonderful audile sensibility, and wonderful auditory imagination in Eliot,

04:21.745 --> 04:24.869
And the work is all laid at the door of the words.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.031
Plus the words.

04:27.172 --> 04:27.512
Okay.

04:27.552 --> 04:33.619
Would you kindly inscribe my copy of my word?

04:33.639 --> 04:46.294
Does it matter to know what people like Dillon or Shakespeare or Keats or any of the great people that you've written about or studied, would it help you to know what they've read?

04:46.395 --> 04:49.238
Yes, I think so.

04:50.450 --> 04:55.857
I think the one understanding, the only one understanding you get of a work of art is knowing about his genesis.

04:56.798 --> 05:01.724
There's no knowledge that you can have that you might not abuse.

05:02.025 --> 05:08.353
Matthew Arnold is wonderful because Arnold repeatedly reminds us there's nothing you can know that you might not abuse.

05:08.793 --> 05:10.255
There's no human benefit.

05:10.535 --> 05:12.678
There's no aspirin that you can't abuse.

05:12.738 --> 05:15.201
There's no knife that you can't stab somebody with.

05:15.221 --> 05:17.004
All of these things lend themselves to abuse.

05:17.364 --> 05:18.145
So that I think

05:18.361 --> 05:25.913
I'm not going to say for every person who uses the knowledge of an author's reading wisely, there is exactly one person.

05:25.953 --> 05:27.916
For every one, there's one who uses it unwisely.

05:28.356 --> 05:42.478
But you can let knowledge of reading come between you and truly reading somebody's work because you can become the sort of person who, how long to put it, who deconstruct is a bad word, but it's the right word.

05:42.739 --> 05:45.583
You may be somebody who will reduce the work of art

05:45.952 --> 05:48.256
to the components that brought it about.

05:48.757 --> 05:58.977
What I mean there is that understanding what components were brought about can be a great help.

05:59.618 --> 06:04.888
On the other hand, there is always the danger that knowing what the components were would have you

06:05.020 --> 06:07.484
caring about the compassions and not about the work.

06:07.504 --> 06:13.373
I mean, there are critics, we know who they are, who care really only about the work of art, and that everything else really is irrelevant.

06:13.393 --> 06:14.495
Yeah, yeah.

06:14.515 --> 06:15.977
And maybe that's going too far in that.

06:16.298 --> 06:18.020
Yeah, I think there's always silly and prudence.

06:18.081 --> 06:21.646
I mean, people have different models of how to be right.

06:22.067 --> 06:26.955
One model of how to be right is to hit the bullseye, the gold on the target.

06:26.975 --> 06:27.676
That's not mine.

06:27.756 --> 06:30.420
Mine is, how do you steer between the rock and the whirlpool?

06:30.738 --> 06:33.201
It's a quite different figure of what the right thing to do.

06:33.221 --> 06:34.402
You're always navigating.

06:34.422 --> 06:38.908
You're always saying, at the moment, we're in more danger of stoniness than the flux.

06:39.909 --> 06:45.476
At Eliot's point about, you know, I'm as cherry, he says, I'm as cherry of order as of disorder.

06:45.636 --> 06:49.861
Petrefaction is no more and no less dangerous than putrefaction.

06:50.522 --> 06:54.346
But you can say, at the moment, we're more in danger of putrefaction than the petrefaction.

06:54.366 --> 06:57.690
That's not because, in the scheme of things, it's always the case.

06:58.008 --> 07:02.032
that petrification is the lesser of the two evils.

07:03.474 --> 07:14.945
I went to a BBC occasion that was honouring the Wasteland, and I was very struck by the fact that I was the only person there who didn't have a copy of the Wasteland manuscript.

07:15.966 --> 07:23.374
And what that means is that now people read the published poem as if it were a rather unsuccessful attempt to write the manuscript.

07:23.573 --> 07:32.623
They should read the manuscript as having been an unsuccessful attempt to write the poem, which then succeeded thanks to Ezra Bound and to Eliot's own self-criticism.

07:33.003 --> 07:36.347
But, you know, there's a funny, the wish to reduce it to where it came from.

07:36.987 --> 07:41.052
Well, it's just an intermediate step along the way of producing a work of art.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.713
Yeah, exactly.

07:43.074 --> 07:48.940
And it's essential if you're, you know, if you go to the University of Texas and where they have everything, you know, and...

07:49.156 --> 07:51.103
which I read about in my first book, General Mattis.

07:51.163 --> 07:53.411
I'd love to send you a couple of my other books.

07:53.431 --> 07:57.164
Well, I would love you to send them, but that means... Not until you come back.

07:57.405 --> 08:00.415
I would be surprised.
