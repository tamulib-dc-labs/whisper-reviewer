00:06.427 --> 00:22.985
A new building, even a beautiful one, won't correct all the problems built up over a century.

00:23.005 --> 00:36.079
But it seems a vast improvement in the city's support for its livelihood, and it adds lustre to the cultural climate, both are long overdue.

00:36.953 --> 00:47.189
Coming up next, a beautiful spring flower could blossom into murder, unless their Hugo Poirot can stop here.

00:52.878 --> 01:05.138
San Francisco Library's original KQED, just so there is Michael.

01:06.907 --> 01:08.969
Anyhow, that will give you some ideas.

01:08.989 --> 01:09.289
Okay.

01:09.650 --> 01:11.672
Is that all in one tape or is that two tapes?

01:11.752 --> 01:12.613
No, it's all in one tape.

01:12.653 --> 01:13.494
Oh, that's great.

01:15.396 --> 01:16.116
Okay, perfect.

01:16.136 --> 01:17.958
These are your paintings in the walls.

01:18.098 --> 01:19.260
Right.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.362
There are actually computer terminals and all of them.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.264
Is there something that I should read into that?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.625
No, it's just one series.

01:24.645 --> 01:27.828
That particular one is called Turning Forms.

01:27.868 --> 01:28.869
Okay.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.511
What's the medium?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.632
Oil.

01:36.573 --> 01:43.739
So, let's see this stuff.

01:43.759 --> 01:59.513
Now that speech that Coulter made, this annual forum thing, he talks about the diversity situation and how they came upon it and how they decided to utilize it, etc., etc.

01:59.673 --> 02:01.214
It's a very interesting little talk.

02:02.935 --> 02:05.938
The thing about the diversity centers is they've never been challenged in court.

02:06.188 --> 02:08.312
Because in San Francisco, you can't really well do that.

02:08.352 --> 02:10.355
You mean the affinity centers where they were called?

02:11.757 --> 02:11.918
Right.

02:11.938 --> 02:12.999
For the affinity groups.

02:16.044 --> 02:21.153
Lots of us are not thrilled with it because it messes with the public space.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.317
It's an unfair thing.

02:23.377 --> 02:32.652
And if you would, in truth, give same space allotments to every group in this city, you'd need something a lot bigger than all the Civic Center to begin to approach that.

02:33.475 --> 02:50.589
So it doesn't belong, in our view, mine and a handful, the rest of us, it doesn't belong in the public library simply because it artificially divides people yet again, rather than bringing them in closer.

02:50.609 --> 03:03.060
Because what they should be bound together over is the fact of the library and its contents, not the color of hair, the color of skin, the preferences that an individual may come with.

03:04.829 --> 03:08.993
The MLU, at some point, you're going to need to know that this is their permission to have parties.

03:09.933 --> 03:19.381
It's a memorandum of understanding between the city and the library, which the library has failed to.

03:19.601 --> 03:25.126
They promised $300,000 a year for which they were going to be paid $150,000 in order to raise $300,000.

03:25.186 --> 03:29.790
The first year they raised $50,000.

03:31.151 --> 03:34.414
They decided they might not charge us the full amount.

03:35.879 --> 03:37.481
because they didn't raise $300,000.

03:37.501 --> 04:04.468
The interesting aspect of that is that their promises notwithstanding, this is very bizarre, and was ran through the Board of Supervisors by the mayor, and there were seven or eight copies of this, and I managed to get...it took me until April 21st, 1997, to get a copy of this signed.

04:05.782 --> 04:12.369
And I started asking about the same time last year.

04:13.850 --> 04:17.795
What accounts for your passion for this project?

04:19.356 --> 04:20.558
I'm a political illustrator.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.178
I trade.

04:22.319 --> 04:23.260
Graphic artist.

04:25.503 --> 04:27.625
I'm kind of an unusual example.

04:28.025 --> 04:35.333
I just don't like people that count in the public on a grand scale, and these people have done that.

04:35.853 --> 04:37.715
$240 million project.

04:37.735 --> 04:46.625
When you add in the cost of the funds to build the library, the cost of the bonds and all the rest, it's $240 million.

04:47.907 --> 04:50.189
Taxpayer money.

04:50.209 --> 04:52.232
We got ripped off royally.

04:53.313 --> 04:58.579
Cheated from, stolen from, and it's still going on.

04:59.400 --> 05:05.607
We had basically three questions, which is where are the books, what happened to the money, and when are you going to do an audit of both?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.651
And that started in September.

05:10.232 --> 05:10.973
Where are the books?

05:11.694 --> 05:12.334
Where are the books?

05:12.455 --> 05:13.196
What happened to the money?

05:17.081 --> 05:18.042
And when are you going to do an audit?

05:19.123 --> 05:23.669
And the mayor, so far, we still have not found answers to any of those three questions.

05:24.750 --> 05:30.598
We've changed the number of the personnel around, but we still haven't got the answers we saw, which is kind of interesting.

05:34.105 --> 05:39.412
Dallin was forced to leave after only nine months in his dream that it took him over nine years to build.

05:41.936 --> 05:48.866
Now, if it's such a wonderful thing, why did it take that short of time?

05:48.886 --> 05:56.316
For instance, here's the footage numbers on the library, and this piece of paper is

05:57.089 --> 05:59.533
That goes to, this is Frontlines.

06:00.274 --> 06:01.737
That's who Carlos Petrini is.

06:01.977 --> 06:03.019
He's the editor of Frontlines.

06:03.059 --> 06:05.102
He asked me specifically about the footage.

06:06.905 --> 06:11.052
I measured all that.

06:11.192 --> 06:14.037
Suzanne Slade is my other half.

06:14.117 --> 06:17.442
Your other half.

06:17.462 --> 06:20.066
And did you kind of come in this through Suzanne?

06:20.247 --> 06:20.527
Yes.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.732
Are you a library person?

06:23.933 --> 06:24.193
No.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.802
A book person, but not a library person.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.727
We have books, yeah.

06:30.767 --> 06:38.480
But you're a political person, certainly, and we have a taste for politics.

06:38.500 --> 06:46.213
The kind of stuff I do is what I do.

06:49.178 --> 06:51.582
Okay, and this is for whom, might we ask?

06:52.034 --> 06:53.896
Different characters, different people.

06:53.916 --> 06:56.278
How would you characterize your work?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.621
How would I characterize it?

07:00.943 --> 07:02.424
Ritistically.

07:02.444 --> 07:06.628
Well, I'm one kind, actually.

07:06.648 --> 07:08.630
You do calendars, I see.

07:08.650 --> 07:10.112
You do job work.

07:10.412 --> 07:11.333
I do books.

07:11.353 --> 07:13.795
I've done 92 covers for Black Lizard Books.

07:14.536 --> 07:17.599
I worked for... Grove Crest is a book publisher.

07:17.719 --> 07:18.240
Yeah.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.421
Dust Jackets.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.162
Oh, I see you did a book for Ray Bradbury.

07:21.203 --> 07:21.703
Is that right?

07:22.882 --> 07:27.687
The Washington Post.

07:29.408 --> 07:35.494
Do you have something like that printed that I can have?

07:35.834 --> 07:37.876
I don't have one.

07:37.896 --> 07:38.717
I'll get you one.

07:38.737 --> 07:38.997
All right.

07:39.017 --> 07:42.501
Well, you're just good as a explanation.

07:42.941 --> 07:45.404
Just so I can place you in time, you know, in place.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.726
How old are you, Jim, if you don't mind telling me?

07:47.746 --> 07:49.748
Fifty-seven.

07:51.069 --> 07:52.230
Between your contemporaries?

07:53.341 --> 08:06.174
You see, I thought that this was going to take about two, three months, just a matter of, you know, making a few things public, and it would get fixed.

08:07.435 --> 08:15.022
And then I realized the size of the machine we were up against, and it became personal, and, uh... How do you mean it became personal?

08:15.603 --> 08:20.968
Well, they basically told us to go peddle our papers, that we weren't really going to affect anything, and this was going to be the end of it.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.783
Have you ever been involved in anything like this before?

08:25.746 --> 08:31.354
I've been involved with LBJ on the negative side.

08:31.655 --> 08:33.898
But I mean to this degree.

08:33.918 --> 08:34.920
Oh, yeah.

08:35.661 --> 08:39.988
But I've never come in at this level.

08:40.048 --> 08:41.931
Usually I'm on the other end.

08:41.971 --> 08:43.493
I'm on the top side of the thing.

08:44.134 --> 08:45.196
What do you mean?

08:47.880 --> 08:48.120
Well...

08:50.311 --> 08:55.756
I was very active with the California Supreme Court, and some of the things that went on there.

08:59.460 --> 09:03.804
I worked for the Attorney General, I worked for the Attorney General of Oklahoma, California.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.365
In what capacity?

09:04.485 --> 09:06.207
I worked for illustration.

09:06.327 --> 09:06.807
Really?

09:06.827 --> 09:08.349
For the state.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.392
I'm very, very good at what I do.

09:11.872 --> 09:12.513
Indulibly.

09:12.533 --> 09:17.938
It changes legislation, things about legislative change, and it impacts

09:18.408 --> 09:19.129
what people think.

09:19.169 --> 09:23.413
Well, when you do stuff for a political, a bureaucratic body, where is it placed?

09:23.433 --> 09:24.194
Where is it published?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.617
Magazines, newspapers, that kind of thing.

09:27.637 --> 09:29.559
How did they get it out?

09:29.579 --> 09:31.161
They got PR people, and that's the way it goes.

09:32.021 --> 09:32.982
That's very interesting.

09:34.604 --> 09:40.129
Attorney General had it printed in a magazine, 100,000 copies, which most of which he took to Washington with it.

09:41.631 --> 09:43.933
Got himself elected.

09:43.973 --> 09:45.234
He was a state senator at the time.

09:45.254 --> 09:46.896
He got elected Attorney General based on that.

09:47.686 --> 09:59.463
They were...he was instrumental in the late 70s in creating for California the Forgotten Victims of Violent Crime, which led to a Victims' Bill of Rights.

10:00.644 --> 10:04.049
I thought that I was doing something that had to do with people who didn't have any voice.

10:05.231 --> 10:17.288
What it was really all about from the get-go was George Duke Major becoming politically viable in other venues, and I got burned by the whole thing, and I

10:17.926 --> 10:23.754
kind of pretty much swore off and quit, actually, over that for about ten years until this thing came along.

10:23.774 --> 10:27.078
And I thought, well, you know, how difficult can this be?

10:27.118 --> 10:29.021
This is open and shut case.

10:29.061 --> 10:29.922
It's black and white.

10:30.403 --> 10:32.345
You either have the books or you haven't got the books.

10:33.387 --> 10:35.469
You either throw them away or you haven't thrown them away.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.832
Hello?

10:38.433 --> 10:38.914
Have an audit.

10:39.194 --> 10:39.955
Let's find out.

10:40.075 --> 10:41.257
How much money did you spend?

10:41.297 --> 10:43.740
Are you Californian, Jim?

10:44.301 --> 10:44.621
No.

10:44.641 --> 10:45.382
Oh, let me see.

10:45.402 --> 10:45.543
Uh-huh.

10:47.045 --> 10:47.325
The, uh,

10:48.503 --> 11:07.200
The problem with this kind of thing, you know, these kinds of things come and go, and era to era they change so that the part of politics that I grew up on would have lynched these people a long time ago.

11:08.541 --> 11:11.263
In Oklahoma, we would have done it with baseball bats.

11:12.505 --> 11:18.510
But this is California, and it's the 1990s, and you can't even threaten anybody, much less pick up a baseball bat.

11:18.693 --> 11:23.038
So the way to do this is with the quorum and in the public eye.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.382
And with organization.

11:26.802 --> 11:27.683
And with organization.

11:27.724 --> 11:31.148
But in the organization, what you have to have are a lot of different kinds of people.

11:31.208 --> 11:35.272
And so what we have, nobody designed the organization.

11:35.292 --> 11:36.374
It just came about.

11:36.614 --> 11:37.555
How did you come together?

11:38.536 --> 11:39.217
Over the speech.

11:39.337 --> 11:40.639
Nick Baker gave a speech.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.100
Did you know these people, Walter?

11:42.120 --> 11:47.907
None of us knew each other, as far as I can tell.

11:49.439 --> 11:52.263
There may have been one or two who had some familiarity.

11:52.323 --> 11:57.730
Timothy Galestri was a mover and shaker who was brought in pretty much for the same reason that I was.

11:57.750 --> 12:04.860
He brought himself in because he heard about it, and he thought, like I did, that this was something that could be fixed.

12:05.601 --> 12:09.846
With a little bit of risk and nitty-gritty, we could get in there and do something.

12:10.968 --> 12:18.518
So he started going to meetings, and he was getting frustrated, and then this speech thing happened, and a whole bunch more people started going to the meetings.

12:19.780 --> 12:30.732
And they had people there that had been there anywhere from one year to five, seven years that were basically burned out after getting shot down time after time by Mr. Coulter and the commission.

12:32.514 --> 12:47.911
And so some of the new blood came along and gave them increased hope for some positive change because Mr. Coulter and Mr. Dowland suddenly had difficulty handling things like political cartoons and severe letters to the editor.

12:47.991 --> 12:49.433
We've produced something like

12:50.645 --> 12:57.652
I don't know, between all of us, maybe four or five hundred different articles have come out, letters to the editor, magazine stories.

12:58.493 --> 13:04.520
In this file I've given you is the Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, L.A.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.084
Times, San Diego Union, some of the stories you might not have seen.

13:08.104 --> 13:13.850
In addition to Newsweek, and Newsweek just did another one not very long ago.

13:13.890 --> 13:14.951
They've done two now.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.795
And the girls, the librarians will know.

13:19.282 --> 13:28.115
It's been on the major television stations in the Bay Area.

13:28.996 --> 13:29.917
It's been on CNN.

13:34.023 --> 13:47.322
It's got a reach that I didn't really expect, but partly why that is is because what the Library has tried to do is such an egregious violation of the public trust.

13:47.983 --> 13:48.664
It's so

13:49.184 --> 13:52.929
opposed to what the people... 78% of the population voted for this.

13:53.590 --> 13:53.930
78%?

13:54.691 --> 13:55.472
Yes.

13:55.492 --> 14:04.424
Voted for this new library and all this money for the books, unaware that Mr. Dowling had no intention of giving them books.

14:05.044 --> 14:08.549
The money went to computers when they spent it at all.

14:08.609 --> 14:16.139
And they'd been using it for everything from candy bars to custodial supplies, but not for books.

14:18.462 --> 14:18.702
And...

14:19.002 --> 14:27.197
You know, had the public known what the administration had in mind, it simply wouldn't have happened.

14:28.380 --> 14:29.241
Let's talk straight.

14:29.261 --> 14:29.943
What's going on?

14:30.323 --> 14:32.247
Why?

14:32.287 --> 14:35.453
That's the $64 million question.

14:35.473 --> 14:36.375
Why do this?

14:36.395 --> 14:38.058
What's in it for these certain people?

14:38.339 --> 14:40.723
There's usually a reason for this.

14:41.699 --> 14:43.701
There obviously is a reason.

14:44.001 --> 14:49.546
Do they really believe that books are dead and that there's no place for the printed book?

14:49.707 --> 14:52.109
No, no, no.

14:52.229 --> 14:58.555
Now this returns to old-time politics, which is follow the money trail.

14:58.575 --> 15:05.902
Three-quarters of the problem is that we have not been absolutely successful in tracking the money trail.

15:05.922 --> 15:11.487
We can't find out why a particular individual does a particular thing.

15:11.855 --> 15:13.858
We know that it's not because of civic spirit.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.881
We know that it's not because they love books.

15:16.802 --> 15:26.195
What we are unable at this point to determine is why they are behaving in the fashion which they would seem that there's a direct monetary connection.

15:26.916 --> 15:36.088
Having said that, it's also incumbent upon those people who might suggest this to come up with, okay, prove it.

15:36.809 --> 15:38.892
And proving it is what's taking so long.

15:39.153 --> 15:40.815
It is very difficult to pin down.

15:43.360 --> 15:55.678
And so we're looking very hard and turning over every rock there is to see if we can find the money connection, because that's what it's about, either now and or in contract form.

15:55.758 --> 16:08.336
In the file, I've given you some stuff on Pacific Bell and its philosophies having to do with telephone service for the four and what happened after they got hooked up with SBC.

16:09.878 --> 16:10.980
What is SBC?

16:11.320 --> 16:12.422
Southwestern Bell, okay.

16:12.807 --> 16:20.639
Southwestern Bell now owns Pacific Telesis and Pacific Bell, which makes them the second largest communications company in America.

16:22.041 --> 16:39.667
They are a major player in the world, and their philosophy having to do with high technology and kind of billing rates, they went from, while their books purchases were frozen, we went from 300 computers to 400 computers.

16:39.687 --> 16:40.789
We don't know how that happened.

16:42.136 --> 16:47.986
because we were screaming poor mouth, and suddenly we have another hundred computers, which are not cheap.

16:48.006 --> 16:54.376
But we can't get any books, and you saw what happened to the periodicals, and you'll see when you see Brooks Hall what happened to the older things.

16:54.717 --> 16:58.663
Well, much of what's in Brooks Hall used to be in the locked case collections in the Old Main.

16:59.565 --> 17:03.091
And the reason McDowell put them there was because they didn't circulate, you know.

17:03.271 --> 17:06.076
And since they didn't circulate, they obviously aren't any good.

17:06.336 --> 17:07.238
Might as well throw them away.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.059
Nobody's ever seen them.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.729
How did Brooks Hall get involved in the equation?

17:10.769 --> 17:12.311
How did they get pulled into the equation?

17:12.471 --> 17:14.793
Brooks Hall got into the equation backwards.

17:15.234 --> 17:19.519
What happened was they got caught doing adopt-a-book and things like that.

17:20.079 --> 17:27.347
Adopt-a-book was a case of where they could take the books they were planning on weeding and sell them to the public or give them to the public.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.610
At one point, Donald was doing this every Friday.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.532
So this was kind of a smokescreen interview?

17:32.390 --> 17:32.810
No, no.

17:33.351 --> 17:37.815
We stopped the Department of Public Works trucks from carting them out of there by the dump truck full.

17:37.835 --> 17:42.680
So Adopt-A-Book came after... After the dump trucks got stopped.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.581
Then came Adopt-A-Book and we stopped that.

17:48.205 --> 17:49.086
Because of publicity.

17:49.506 --> 17:52.869
They finally had to... And then they kept on leading.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.412
But now they can't get rid of them.

17:55.432 --> 17:56.693
They're stuck with them.

17:56.713 --> 18:00.676
So, because it's very... They got finger-cut with their pants down.

18:00.937 --> 18:01.317
Big time.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.661
And now, of course... They can't get rid of them, and they can't stop.

18:06.001 --> 18:12.471
The PR is enormous, and so now they had to find... They're damn lucky that a place like Brooks Hall existed, aren't they?

18:13.352 --> 18:18.921
Brooks Hall sitting there is a deserted convention center, and it is connected by tunnels to the main.

18:18.941 --> 18:20.503
So, it bailed them out to a degree.

18:21.158 --> 18:26.164
To a degree, but now that we have been noticing the DPW trucks are going down there weekly again.

18:26.364 --> 18:29.448
And we have no way of knowing what's in Brooks Hall.

18:29.468 --> 18:30.630
It's offering this to the public.

18:30.830 --> 18:32.872
Are books still being disposed of?

18:33.173 --> 18:33.373
Yeah.

18:33.573 --> 18:34.534
That's a question, isn't it?

18:34.554 --> 18:34.675
Sure.

18:35.956 --> 18:38.259
But we have no way of knowing this, we in the public.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.542
Are books still being... Do we know what books are down there?

18:41.203 --> 18:41.363
No.

18:42.404 --> 18:43.465
We know some of what's down there.

18:43.485 --> 18:47.130
Nick Baker is going to give me... He finally got, you know, the 32.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.613
He's got a list of supposedly all the books.

18:50.032 --> 18:50.693
It's on a disc.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.394
He's going to copy it for me.

18:53.576 --> 19:02.365
Well, Mr. Biller and I looked real hard, and he spent about 500 hours on it.

19:02.425 --> 19:03.826
And you met Walter through this?

19:04.086 --> 19:04.267
Yeah.

19:04.527 --> 19:06.749
Do you have a name for your group, or it's just a group?

19:07.470 --> 19:10.012
Well, originally, when we first started, it was called Edith Cedar Group.

19:10.313 --> 19:10.793
Say again.

19:11.013 --> 19:12.034
Edith Cedar.

19:12.535 --> 19:12.795
Edith?

19:13.996 --> 19:14.377
Cedar.

19:14.897 --> 19:15.418
S?

19:15.438 --> 19:17.740
Or C. C-E-D-A-R.

19:18.021 --> 19:19.482
And who is Edith Cedar?

19:20.288 --> 19:21.289
It was a street corner.

19:24.993 --> 19:26.334
Two streets, Edith and Cedar.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.279
What's the significance of the streets?

19:32.401 --> 19:42.471
We were just driving, and we decided that we needed to call it something, and we couldn't figure out what to call it, so we decided a couple of streets.

19:42.512 --> 19:43.933
The intersection of a street was fine.

19:44.335 --> 19:45.236
So that's what we came up with.

19:45.256 --> 19:48.641
So you happened to be driving and those two streets were there, Edith and Cedar?

19:48.761 --> 19:48.982
Right.

19:49.042 --> 19:53.768
So it's not where you meet, it's not where anybody lives, it just happens to be two streets.

19:54.329 --> 20:07.828
Well, it's near someone who had, at the time, a considerable problem, but it was very near Melissa, and Melissa was

20:09.023 --> 20:13.248
But the name really has no great significance.

20:13.268 --> 20:15.772
No, we just thought it sounded like a nice librarian.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.494
I don't want to be too picky here.

20:17.654 --> 20:18.095
I'm curious.

20:18.996 --> 20:21.279
No, it just sounded like a librarian.

20:21.299 --> 20:24.864
It didn't sound like Macho City or somebody with a sledgehammer.

20:24.984 --> 20:28.348
We wanted something that wouldn't set anybody off.

20:28.666 --> 20:29.487
that we could use.

20:29.807 --> 20:37.175
The People's Mobilization Committee to stop the disruption of our cultural heritage.

20:37.415 --> 20:39.317
That would really be great, right?

20:39.337 --> 20:40.338
That would do it, wouldn't it?

20:40.358 --> 20:44.502
Also, we had a diverse group in terms of what the group really seriously wanted.

20:44.883 --> 20:47.906
The group did not want to go macho.

20:48.246 --> 20:56.935
The group was composed in part of librarians, half a dozen maybe, and the rest were

20:57.320 --> 20:58.882
There were some impassioned writers.

20:58.942 --> 21:00.604
Tilly Ellison was one of them.

21:00.724 --> 21:02.687
I've got to give her a call today, by the way.

21:02.707 --> 21:03.588
She's expecting me.

21:03.608 --> 21:04.469
I've talked to her once.

21:04.749 --> 21:04.989
Okay.

21:05.029 --> 21:07.773
Tilly, cut out some time because Tilly takes a while.

21:09.375 --> 21:09.795
What do you mean?

21:10.496 --> 21:11.117
Not up here.

21:11.557 --> 21:11.818
Here.

21:12.078 --> 21:13.860
She has a little difficulty getting it out.

21:14.201 --> 21:16.343
But she's very sharp.

21:16.383 --> 21:18.566
She's 80-something.

21:18.846 --> 21:21.590
Anyway, she was part of this at the beginning.

21:21.930 --> 21:22.631
Still part of it.

21:22.791 --> 21:23.412
Active part of it.

21:25.012 --> 21:31.222
And anyway, there were divisions in the group, as there are in most, about what way to go, what way to proceed.

21:31.823 --> 21:40.796
Well, Bill Hale is particularly meeting-oriented, rule-oriented.

21:40.977 --> 21:42.018
He loves rules.

21:43.541 --> 21:52.875
And he wanted us to not ever talk to each other except in a formal meeting, which won't work.

21:53.362 --> 22:06.714
So what we decided early on was the best and most effective way for us to function is for each of us to figure out what we would like to do and go ahead and do it and then tell everybody else what we did just so that we don't duplicate activities.

22:08.115 --> 22:11.018
And that's kind of when we started functioning pretty well.

22:13.400 --> 22:19.665
Mr. Gillespie is a PR person and he's really good at what he does.

22:20.927 --> 22:22.508
Mr. Biller is

22:22.825 --> 22:24.067
historical in nature.

22:24.207 --> 22:25.548
Kind of an archivist, I guess.

22:25.909 --> 22:30.234
Yeah, and a bit of an activist and passionate.

22:30.494 --> 22:34.079
Well, he refers to the group as ourself, which amuses me.

22:34.099 --> 22:35.580
I remember him, ourself.

22:36.401 --> 22:40.687
Well, I think when he says self, he's talking about just a few of us that are active.

22:41.207 --> 22:50.098
Because there are those of us who do things, and then there are those who write letters, and they think, and they talk, and they want to see things happen, but

22:51.682 --> 22:53.945
Most of the time, they don't run out there and do something.

22:54.966 --> 23:01.273
I mean, you know, the use of discretion to sell almost makes it a political action group, is what it is.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.415
But you are, you know, there's no denying that.

23:03.836 --> 23:07.100
It's just that we have all different kinds of people in the group.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.983
Walter was with Nick when they counted books.

23:11.124 --> 23:15.729
He was part of that invasion that Nick apologized for.

23:15.749 --> 23:18.152
It was not an invasion.

23:18.212 --> 23:18.853
They were let in.

23:19.880 --> 23:26.288
somebody had a key, so they didn't break into the library to count the shelf space and all that, way back when.

23:29.912 --> 23:32.335
It was Nick and Walter and two librarians.

23:33.937 --> 23:46.292
But the point of it was that these individual people, it's amazing how much, how different we are and how much we're able to accomplish being as different as we are from each other.

23:47.453 --> 23:53.281
But the common goal is to make that library a habitable place for a library to exist.

23:53.742 --> 23:54.723
That's the common goal.

23:55.545 --> 23:58.990
And initially it was Dowling, and then it became Coulter.

24:00.352 --> 24:16.735
It has to be removed, because Mr. Coulter's activities over the long haul in particular, but even, and most especially lately, has just, I mean, the man is, you'll see when you start reading this stuff, he's just unbelievable.

24:17.016 --> 24:17.376
I mean,

24:17.643 --> 24:34.585
At one point he wanted to organize, he wanted to appoint a citizens committee to replace the public so that we would have a diverse citizens committee made up of blacks and whites and purples and oranges and gays and lesbians and all kinds of stuff, right, that was not going to the meetings.

24:35.306 --> 24:41.614
And we apprised him of the fact that all of us have the same notice, the same people show up at the meetings every time he hates us.

24:43.036 --> 24:46.080
Visibly, he is disturbed by us.

24:47.073 --> 24:58.003
And there are papers in there, transcript tapes, I mean, transcriptions of tapes from Library Commission meetings, where he says, you know, I look out here every week and I see this, and I don't see any people of color, and I don't see any gay people.

24:58.023 --> 24:58.743
Well, why don't they come?

25:00.745 --> 25:03.968
Because it's a futile effort, unless you're willing to do battle.

25:04.288 --> 25:07.651
What I'm saying is, if you don't go, don't bitch.

25:08.352 --> 25:09.132
You get no complaint.

25:09.172 --> 25:10.754
That's what the people at the meeting said.

25:10.974 --> 25:15.658
Mr. Coulter said, we're not getting anything done, this is a waste of the public's time.

25:16.419 --> 25:16.759
He said,

25:17.093 --> 25:18.175
Hello, we are the public.

25:18.195 --> 25:18.896
We are the public.

25:19.036 --> 25:21.380
You represent us, not the other way around.

25:24.225 --> 25:24.987
Colfer didn't wait.

25:25.187 --> 25:26.529
He was hell-bent on doing this.

25:26.569 --> 25:27.992
We managed to stop him.

25:28.012 --> 25:30.676
There's letters to the mayor and all that.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.217
Carry on.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.321
Finally, that went away.

25:33.441 --> 25:34.302
How often do they meet?

25:34.903 --> 25:37.328
Once a month, supposedly, when they don't cancel.

25:37.488 --> 25:38.429
Do they have an agenda?

25:39.712 --> 25:39.912
Yeah.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.797
Oh, yeah.

25:41.817 --> 26:00.123
Well, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Chafee have been suing them regularly over violations of the Sunshine Ordinance and the Brown Act, both of which have to do with open meeting laws, because they regularly... Mr. Coulter has no respect whatsoever for law, and they meet illegally all the time.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.164
What's his background?

26:01.184 --> 26:04.409
I mean, does he have any... He came from the Nevada State Legislature.

26:04.789 --> 26:05.290
Nevada.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.333
He was a state rep in Nevada.

26:08.444 --> 26:09.866
Coulter, was this Nevada State?

26:09.886 --> 26:10.847
We're asking him about that.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.890
We haven't been able to find out anything.

26:13.792 --> 26:14.993
That's a very interesting little thing.

26:15.013 --> 26:17.817
He's telling me you heard that he has legislative experience.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.402
I understand maybe from the state of Nevada.

26:22.404 --> 26:23.525
See if he wants to talk about that.

26:23.585 --> 26:29.794
Anyway, in some way, he got into the phone company situation.

26:31.116 --> 26:32.458
He is part of the gay community.

26:33.419 --> 26:35.262
A fact that the gay community would love to forget.

26:35.647 --> 26:36.869
They are not pleased with him.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.172
When he came out, he had a party at a commission meeting.

26:39.712 --> 26:39.933
Really?

26:39.953 --> 26:45.540
The gay community got him off to one side and urged him to go back and cause him pleased.

26:45.560 --> 26:45.820
That's funny.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.002
He's not a loved individual.

26:47.703 --> 26:47.923
Why?

26:48.343 --> 26:49.465
Because of why?

26:49.485 --> 26:56.694
Because of not having nothing to do with being gay, having everything to do with his policies and the way he treats people at the library commission.

26:56.714 --> 26:58.917
Who appointed him to the library commission?

26:59.798 --> 27:03.163
The most recent one was Willie Brown, who initially appointed him, I'm not sure.

27:03.944 --> 27:04.945
Audrey can probably tell you.

27:05.532 --> 27:07.434
She's got all those records.

27:07.454 --> 27:14.243
But the thing... Generally speaking, somebody gets appointed, and this is a pro bono thing, you know, get paid for this, I assume, right?

27:14.944 --> 27:15.885
Right.

27:15.905 --> 27:17.607
His own company's doing all right.

27:17.627 --> 27:20.391
I don't know, I'm just saying, I'm talking superficial now.

27:20.471 --> 27:33.227
No, in actuality, I think what you could say, you know, believable... So generally speaking, when you get appointed to one of these things, the rationale is, well, this person has been involved with libraries all his life and he has a demonstrated interest.

27:33.477 --> 27:34.578
No, no, no.

27:34.699 --> 27:36.861
Actually, what it is is not so much libraries.

27:37.642 --> 27:49.176
Any city commission can do... It's a very clubby thing, and it's a political thing, and you do it for your own self-interest down the road.

27:49.196 --> 27:50.959
I mean, this is the whole idea.

27:50.999 --> 27:55.244
It's not so much that you're going to make a fortune out of being on this commission or that.

27:55.805 --> 27:57.707
It's that it's good for your political career.

27:57.807 --> 28:00.210
It's a good thing to do politically.

28:00.697 --> 28:05.484
wherever you happen to be in your business life or in your community life or whatever.

28:05.505 --> 28:09.491
You said this guy's got AIDS, right?

28:09.511 --> 28:09.711
Yeah.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.314
How long does he have?

28:12.135 --> 28:15.600
Well, just before he left on vacation, he looked like he had about a month.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.765
And he got back to vacation and he looks like a totally rejuvenated man.

28:19.106 --> 28:23.453
You don't think about talking HIV, you're talking AIDS.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.295
Oh, that's serious.

28:25.315 --> 28:25.936
Very, yeah.

28:26.798 --> 28:27.299
Very, very.

28:28.160 --> 28:28.881
But he is a

28:29.333 --> 28:34.959
One wonders if he'll live long enough to see my book photos.

28:35.279 --> 28:36.300
Two months ago, no, I know.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.222
Two months ago, I would have said absolutely no.

28:39.584 --> 28:47.032
But I looked at him at the last meeting, and the only thing that was different was he seemed to be on some kind of something to mellow him out.

28:47.933 --> 28:54.720
But, he looks fine now, compared to what he did.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.923
He was good to look corpse-like, and he had

28:58.747 --> 29:00.049
He had a stomach like this.

29:00.910 --> 29:01.631
And that's gone.

29:02.612 --> 29:04.535
Well, it's reduced amazingly.

29:05.296 --> 29:06.678
I mean, he was a very fit man.

29:06.698 --> 29:08.600
I mean, he wears very expensive clothes.

29:08.620 --> 29:11.144
I mean, this is something that's going to show instantly.

29:11.204 --> 29:17.492
You wear a $1,500 suit, $2,000 suit, I mean, you just don't have room for this.

29:17.512 --> 29:20.095
Not when you obviously go to the gym every day and all that stuff.

29:21.277 --> 29:25.783
You know, so he was, personally, I understood, very sick.

29:26.641 --> 29:31.507
And I also understand that this kind of tension and stress is not good for that disease.

29:32.349 --> 29:33.089
It accelerates it.

29:34.852 --> 29:38.717
But Mr. Coulter is a survivor, whatever else he might be.

29:39.338 --> 29:42.462
This is one tough cookie, and you are not going to get rid of him easily.

29:43.964 --> 29:46.287
Because if that were possible, he would have been gone a long time ago.

29:46.307 --> 29:50.192
We have done a lot with Mr. Coulter, but apparently not enough.

29:51.614 --> 29:53.116
And how about the city in large?

29:54.137 --> 29:54.758
Is the city...

29:55.025 --> 29:55.866
Open cesspool.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.468
Alert to what you're doing?

29:57.668 --> 29:58.650
Oh, yeah.

29:58.670 --> 29:59.891
Oh, yeah.

29:59.911 --> 30:00.352
They laugh.

30:00.472 --> 30:01.934
I think it's just really funny.

30:01.954 --> 30:04.077
I mean, people come up to me on the street and say.

30:04.097 --> 30:05.518
They think you're nuts or what?

30:05.578 --> 30:05.899
Oh, no.

30:06.099 --> 30:06.920
They know I'm not nuts.

30:07.581 --> 30:08.002
No, no, no.

30:08.522 --> 30:15.010
They just say, eh, well, I see you got your back this time, didn't they?

30:15.071 --> 30:19.877
You know, so it's kind of a convivial thing.

30:19.917 --> 30:22.500
I mean, it's not blood in the streets we're talking about.

30:22.885 --> 30:24.968
You got him that time.

30:25.028 --> 30:27.331
You know, he got you this time, you know, back and forth.

30:27.431 --> 30:29.453
So there is a back and forth.

30:29.473 --> 30:40.187
But the true nitty-gritty, the way the city really works, the mayor is the only person in the city government that's allowed to give a press conference.

30:40.207 --> 30:42.350
No city head is allowed to speak to the press.

30:43.051 --> 30:45.013
You will be fired instantaneously for that.

30:45.774 --> 30:51.602
We just finished fixing a campaign for $535 million worth of new ballpark for the Niner.

30:51.622 --> 30:51.762
Mm-hmm.

30:53.142 --> 30:57.587
And the mayor doesn't think, and he thinks he can walk on water.

30:57.627 --> 31:03.192
I mean, he's a believer now that there is nothing that can touch him, and it's getting completely out of hand.

31:04.834 --> 31:13.303
He's offered an amendment to the Constitution, the state Constitution, that does away with, not Constitution, charter, city charter.

31:13.743 --> 31:15.505
City charter, do away with competitive bidding.

31:16.106 --> 31:18.669
Bad thing gets in the way of business.

31:20.070 --> 31:22.052
You know, and on the other hand,

31:23.382 --> 31:30.629
I would have said the mayor was going to definitely be a one-term mayor if there's anything left to give away after he's done.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.512
But nobody's in the wings.

31:33.552 --> 31:34.873
There's nobody going to run against him.

31:36.334 --> 31:38.016
He fired 300 people when he took office.

31:39.497 --> 31:42.100
He only appoints people who do exactly what he says.

31:42.480 --> 31:47.285
And if there's too much flack, he'll still get rid of them.

31:47.565 --> 31:51.769
And that's possibly the only reason we would have succeeded is because it's becoming very uncomfortable.

31:52.812 --> 31:55.776
It's the reason that we came up with the posters.

31:55.796 --> 31:57.960
We decided to make it a little more uncomfortable.

31:58.681 --> 32:02.166
You will see, I mean, this gets boring after a while.

32:02.306 --> 32:05.691
And does, you know, when are you going to deal with this guy?

32:06.713 --> 32:11.660
So, obviously he doesn't want to release him because he represents a major connection to the phone company.

32:11.680 --> 32:18.010
Now, the phone company has a no-bid contract with the city, which is, on the face of it, completely illegal.

32:18.651 --> 32:21.655
If you have more than one company in a given field,

32:21.938 --> 32:24.100
You cannot have a no-bid contract in the city.

32:24.120 --> 32:24.801
It's not allowed.

32:25.722 --> 32:27.184
We have several fund companies here.

32:28.245 --> 32:29.887
They have a sweetheart deal with the city, and that's it.

32:31.228 --> 32:33.090
The sweetheart could, for what?

32:33.310 --> 32:34.111
To provide what?

32:34.131 --> 32:35.393
Fund service.

32:35.433 --> 32:36.093
For the whole city?

32:36.414 --> 32:37.034
Yeah.

32:37.054 --> 32:40.338
For all city governments, city agencies, offices, computers, all that.

32:41.319 --> 32:45.043
What do you think these other companies could provide that service?

32:45.564 --> 32:46.645
Or came in with the money?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.407
They'd certainly bid on it, couldn't they?

32:48.427 --> 32:49.488
It's a hell of a contract.

32:50.589 --> 32:51.490
They'd certainly bid on it.

32:52.938 --> 32:56.422
But they weren't off of a chance.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.827
It's an ugly thing.

32:59.947 --> 33:03.992
You'll hear Peter Byrne's name mentioned a couple, three times in the course of this.

33:04.012 --> 33:07.897
Now, he has a newsletter called the San Francisco Investigators.

33:07.957 --> 33:13.684
He's an ex-private eye and a very interesting man.

33:13.704 --> 33:19.992
And he's got a couple of numbers on the city and what it's...

33:21.946 --> 33:23.547
requirements are and are not.

33:24.368 --> 33:38.140
And it turns out PG&E, which is the gas and electric company, the phone company, and a couple of others, are major benefactors for not just one project, but many.

33:39.181 --> 33:45.005
Willie Brown's major constituency that supported him in getting into office were construction companies.

33:45.026 --> 33:49.669
And when you take a walk around Civic Center, you just count the number of cranes down there.

33:49.689 --> 33:51.531
And that's not the only place this is going on.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.768
massive building programs.

33:55.788 --> 34:01.374
I mean, Moody's bound rating for the city dropped to an A3.

34:01.394 --> 34:09.543
The next step down is B, and we have really played fast and loose.

34:09.763 --> 34:12.706
If something serious happens, the city just simply has no money.

34:12.726 --> 34:13.247
We're broke.

34:14.187 --> 34:19.493
The only difference is the mayor's presenting it as though good times are here again, folks.

34:20.047 --> 34:26.977
And if you don't know how much money the Treasury has or how much you owe, they just keep dipping in there, taking out handfuls.

34:27.057 --> 34:31.142
And the library is just a large eyesore that's sitting there.

34:31.162 --> 34:33.105
This is supposed to be the jewel in the city's crown.

34:33.165 --> 34:36.209
It's turning out to be a really big rotten apple.

34:36.810 --> 34:39.093
And the mayor's sick of hearing about it, if you want another trick.

34:40.595 --> 34:45.502
But, you know, he's... Well, getting rid of him would accomplish what?

34:45.522 --> 34:47.625
Beyond getting... Mr. Coulter?

34:47.645 --> 34:47.825
Yeah.

34:48.887 --> 34:49.227
Well...

34:49.392 --> 34:52.016
Mr. Coulter's agenda is to get rid of the union.

34:52.417 --> 34:54.280
He's designed this thing.

34:54.700 --> 35:04.976
His point is to eliminate the unions from the library and to do away with anything like a book purchase program.

35:05.016 --> 35:17.796
He was in love with Mr. Dowling's plan for the city library, which pretty much is the same plan as these guys had.

35:19.379 --> 35:27.412
The Omni Group and Becker and Hayes, December 14, 1987, commissioned studies.

35:28.994 --> 35:35.945
These kinds of things, the inexplicable part is why they, why now?

35:37.989 --> 35:40.653
Where's the profit for you and me?

35:40.693 --> 35:45.100
I mean, if you and I look at the situation in the houses, a couple of guys in America,

35:46.025 --> 35:48.427
So, I mean, you're not going to get rich stealing a library area.

35:48.507 --> 35:49.428
How the hell can you do that?

35:50.109 --> 35:50.289
Right?

35:50.309 --> 35:51.250
It doesn't make any sense.

35:52.551 --> 35:55.874
A phone company gets paid every time you click on and off the Internet.

35:55.914 --> 36:00.778
And for some reason... Are you sure?

36:01.159 --> 36:01.399
Yes.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.683
Access fee.

36:05.703 --> 36:08.505
Is it a flat rate fee, or is it every time somebody goes on?

36:08.545 --> 36:11.328
Well, you may have noticed that SBC is fighting the fence.

36:11.388 --> 36:13.990
They want the libraries to pay full price.

36:14.189 --> 36:20.315
They don't want a break for schools or libraries when it comes to high technology and phone service.

36:20.335 --> 36:29.644
So they're actually suing the government, force the government to let them charge libraries and schools full price.

36:30.826 --> 36:35.550
Now, Mr. Coulter is a major executive with that company that is doing that very thing.

36:36.591 --> 36:42.137
While as the head of the Library Commission, he is supposed to be arbitrating.

36:42.910 --> 36:47.637
for special rates paid by the library to the phone company.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.661
How does that square?

36:50.681 --> 36:55.929
I mean, all these dual things that don't make any sense.

36:57.691 --> 37:00.756
There's an old phrase called conflict of interest, you know.

37:00.856 --> 37:03.860
Even the appearance of itself.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.561
Yeah, I know.

37:04.581 --> 37:09.148
It would have brought the house down any other place, but it doesn't seem to bother anybody around here.

37:09.649 --> 37:11.972
Conflict of interest abounds.

37:13.387 --> 37:16.932
You know, it just happened in Oklahoma City, we'd have lynched those people.

37:17.613 --> 37:20.697
They'd stolen those many books and done all this weird stuff.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.521
Dow was talking about, what do you say, two and a half million books?

37:24.823 --> 37:25.604
Yeah, right.

37:26.264 --> 37:30.711
That's 720,000 when we counted them about three months ago.

37:30.731 --> 37:32.293
720,000 in the system?

37:33.634 --> 37:34.856
Sound like two and a half million to you?

37:35.737 --> 37:36.198
It does.

37:37.380 --> 37:42.887
So, we found out that we made some technical errors, but even...

37:43.002 --> 37:51.774
allowing for the correction based on the technology, which automation furnished us, it still didn't clear a million.

37:53.497 --> 37:54.799
So where are the other million and a half?

37:56.521 --> 37:57.082
You tell me.

37:59.345 --> 38:00.787
These are serious questions.

38:00.867 --> 38:10.461
I mean, there are questions in there, in Kofa's file and Dallin's file, that you might want to just read the short...

38:10.643 --> 38:16.955
correspondence, so that when you talk to the gentleman in question, there's some of that stuff you can convert to some interesting questions.

38:17.537 --> 38:22.807
I'm sure that, you know, maybe you'll finally succeed in finding out stuff we've been unable to find out.

38:23.729 --> 38:28.478
Well, you know, you guys are full-timers here working on this.

38:29.239 --> 38:29.821
Not really.

38:29.881 --> 38:33.107
I mean, I'm working on two books, a deck of cards,

38:35.804 --> 38:38.628
I'm currently being evicted from my apartment, among other things.

38:38.768 --> 38:41.472
So I'm kind of busy, busy, born besides the library.

38:42.333 --> 38:46.459
And it could be very interesting.

38:46.719 --> 38:48.982
Condo conversions or something?

38:49.002 --> 38:50.504
Bastards.

38:50.524 --> 38:53.288
Well, the guy that's buying the building is one of Willie's building inspectors.

38:53.809 --> 38:59.136
The guy who owns the building is one of Willie's confidants.

38:59.156 --> 39:01.179
He's the point man on China for Willie.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.123
He went to China with him the last time he...

39:04.424 --> 39:10.833
He advises Willie on situations to do with Singapore, Hong Kong, and the local Chinese community.

39:10.853 --> 39:15.699
I don't think the sale of the building has to do with Willie, however.

39:15.760 --> 39:23.470
I think it really has to do with some family matter within my landlord's, which is very interesting that those two things should coincide.

39:24.331 --> 39:29.679
And it happened just about the time things got very uncomfortable at the library for Mr. Brown.

39:29.699 --> 39:33.604
Right about the time exactly when I first surfaced with one of

39:33.888 --> 39:35.610
really nasty cartoon about, will it?

39:36.111 --> 39:39.236
And where was it published?

39:39.256 --> 39:40.397
Where are these cartoons?

39:40.658 --> 39:47.588
No, this cartoon, well, Frontline's a published one, but they're a freebie, they're not a regular paper.

39:49.250 --> 39:59.625
This was, we just put out news releases on fax, on the internet, and we let the world know that this was going on.

40:00.685 --> 40:02.968
Some of our things get responded to in a big way.

40:03.048 --> 40:04.409
Other things go unnoticed.

40:05.110 --> 40:06.632
I mean, no response at all.

40:06.712 --> 40:08.094
Sometimes it's great.

40:08.394 --> 40:11.698
Like we got Brooks Hall covered with that one cartoon of Willie.

40:11.718 --> 40:18.065
He called up every, his office called every news facility in the city and said, do not cover this story.

40:19.687 --> 40:21.649
Channel 4 ended up covering Brooks Hall.

40:22.190 --> 40:28.397
And Channel 4 is owned by the Chronicle, which is, we call it the Brownicle because it's so pro-Willie.

40:29.643 --> 40:35.630
But his office called them six times in the morning and said, don't cover the story.

40:35.671 --> 40:36.652
So they went to Brooks Hall.

40:37.172 --> 40:38.053
They shot the story.

40:38.594 --> 40:40.997
They came back, and they called six more times.

40:41.017 --> 40:41.578
And don't air it.

40:42.940 --> 40:43.340
They aired it.

40:45.282 --> 40:50.048
So he spent all this political capital buying off ABC not to run the story on Brooks Hall.

40:50.729 --> 40:52.231
And his own damn station does it.

40:53.893 --> 40:54.154
Wow.

40:54.934 --> 40:59.380
But, you know, it's, I don't know, it's like San Francisco's always been kind of,

41:00.035 --> 41:07.446
rough, around the edge, you know, that, what do they call it, Barbary Toast Syndrome.

41:07.466 --> 41:10.230
49ers, Gold Rush, and all that kind of stuff.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.913
And there is an element of wild about it.

41:12.714 --> 41:23.209
But this is, I mean, we have this foundation, is a group of upper crust people, many of whom are very prominent citizens, and some of those, I'm sure, will give you a good interview.

41:24.151 --> 41:29.198
On the other side of the fence, they're as much involved in this as I am, but from the opposite point of view.

41:30.477 --> 41:35.463
I'm sure we'll not have a whole lot of nice things to say about us, but anyway, that's America.

41:35.723 --> 41:41.891
So, the idea is that the library is a stepchild.

41:42.451 --> 41:44.254
The city is SOVs.

41:44.294 --> 41:48.519
Symphony, Opera, and Ballet are the three things that it cares about.

41:48.719 --> 41:51.903
Graphic arts and libraries are right out the window.

41:53.285 --> 41:57.129
It's just, you know, everybody, every place has its own little things in San Francisco.

41:57.530 --> 41:59.472
Never developed an attachment for

41:59.688 --> 42:01.590
books or paintings.

42:01.610 --> 42:05.375
The gallery scene here is terrible, and the library is equally bad.

42:06.616 --> 42:13.885
I lived here back in the late 60s, and I worked in this little city, Worcester, which is our art museum.

42:14.285 --> 42:15.647
I've always said it was better.

42:17.049 --> 42:20.072
Worcester has a magnificent art museum.

42:20.273 --> 42:22.856
See, I mean, every city has its thing that it does, you know.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.818
Well, we could care about books, too, like that.

42:25.388 --> 42:31.625
Listen, I think I'm going to, we've got two hours in here, and I'm going to go back, because I want to go over some of the stuff.

42:31.646 --> 42:32.732
A lot of what I'm saying.
