00:03.727 --> 00:19.010
Basically, I teach two courses on history of books, one for undergraduates as a seminar and one for graduate students as a seminar.

00:19.030 --> 00:21.674
The one for undergraduates starts with St.

00:21.734 --> 00:31.168
Augustine and goes down to the World Wide Web, and the one for graduate students concentrates much more on the 15th and 16th and early 17th centuries.

00:31.351 --> 00:33.113
Is it history of a book or history of reading?

00:33.674 --> 00:52.638
Well, I call it history of books, their producers, and their consumers, and trying to look at, in different ways in the two courses, at reading, but also at writing, because I think that for most of Western history, the distinction between reading and writing was much less clear than it is now.

00:53.219 --> 00:58.185
In many, many contexts, you read with a pen in hand, you took notes,

00:58.570 --> 01:06.460
you worked up the notes into something which you then circulated under your own name, what's reading and what's writing is not so clear.

01:06.921 --> 01:11.466
In a world of classical al-usuf poetry, every writing was a reading.

01:11.566 --> 01:27.126
So I try to teach them to think that way, to think of it not in the sort of romantic era idea of the writer standing on the cliffside with the muse infusing an inspiration that has nothing to do with tradition or earlier precedent, but in terms of

01:27.359 --> 01:32.887
production, consumption, which doesn't mean I don't think they should read text.

01:32.907 --> 01:34.329
I think they absolutely should.

01:34.349 --> 01:36.633
I just find this a way to get them excited about reading text.

01:37.394 --> 01:48.390
How would you describe what you teach, as opposed to what Mr. Garten is involved in his given book?

01:48.871 --> 01:51.314
Well, there's a lot of similarities.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.518
He's one of the great pioneers in that field.

01:54.499 --> 01:55.881
But there are also differences.

01:56.367 --> 02:07.119
One is that I'm interested in, I think, in a longer chronological range than he is, and I've actually worked fairly directly on material.

02:07.139 --> 02:08.460
You know that you're a truffle hunter.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.464
Yeah, I'm definitely a truffle hunter, but I hunt truffles in many different places.

02:12.484 --> 02:20.793
I go from the 15th to the 19th century, and even, I'm hoping, in my own research, now the 20th, as a historian of books and reading.

02:20.914 --> 02:25.058
Bob does this, too, with his new work on East Germany and on India.

02:25.477 --> 02:35.451
I do think that he has an enormous single body of material from 18th century France and Switzerland, which is his basic corpus.

02:36.132 --> 02:49.952
And I tend to be more of a case study person and to look for individuals or for objects where I can gather material and make a case study and to be willing to go across widely different periods and places in search of these.

02:50.413 --> 02:54.859
They're both perfectly legitimate.

02:55.430 --> 03:05.165
And in teaching, he actually, after I designed my undergraduate course, I discovered that he had taught a similar course 10 or 12 years ago, which I hadn't known about.

03:05.826 --> 03:08.150
Do you have a syllabus for the course?

03:08.170 --> 03:13.578
I do, but if you'll email me, my secretary left, and she always locks the file cabinet.

03:13.999 --> 03:17.404
No, no, not at all.

03:17.553 --> 03:18.654
There's books in there.

03:18.834 --> 03:19.975
I'm sure they're writing.

03:19.995 --> 03:22.057
Well, we have both in the undergraduate.

03:22.077 --> 03:36.090
In the graduate course, we work in the special collections department, and the students must present every week original materials from the Princeton collections, or in some cases, photocopies of things we don't have.

03:36.330 --> 03:38.492
From the Princeton collections is very important.

03:38.512 --> 03:41.915
Yeah, but I think it's much better if they're using first-hand documents.

03:41.935 --> 03:47.560
And so it was very hard this year, because I had almost 20 students taking and auditing this graduate course.

03:47.776 --> 03:53.903
and just finding enough materials for them each to do two presentations is not easy.

03:53.923 --> 03:56.285
You don't mind if it's a pre-ranging discussion?

03:56.305 --> 03:57.306
Not at least.

03:57.506 --> 04:02.952
There are a thousand different things that you can invest yourself into.

04:02.972 --> 04:08.318
I'm doing a chapter on books still matter.

04:08.518 --> 04:12.423
Numbers, apparently, are still important.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.606
Harvard quite scrupulously

04:15.873 --> 04:17.936
maintains its leadership.

04:17.956 --> 04:20.480
I mean, 14 million books, how many did they add last year?

04:21.021 --> 04:24.346
We've been taking my daughter around, she's working here today.

04:24.927 --> 04:29.474
One of the first things on every one of these tours, they always tell us how many volumes there are in the library.

04:29.614 --> 04:32.539
Princeton likes to boast, because everyone boasts a dog where they're first.

04:32.579 --> 04:36.866
We boast particularly about the fact that we circulate more books per capita.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.408
Per capita.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.532
I took notes while I was in Firestone.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.114
I hadn't seen this statistic.

04:42.294 --> 04:43.416
86 books.

04:43.902 --> 04:47.207
per fiscal year of faculty student.

04:47.227 --> 04:48.509
I said, that's very interesting.

04:48.529 --> 04:49.351
I hadn't seen that.

04:49.871 --> 04:54.078
And according to Karen Trainor, our librarian, our number is the highest.

04:54.539 --> 04:55.901
I've never seen it before.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.305
Well, every library can now capture this.

04:58.665 --> 05:01.830
I don't know where the librarians do, but it's easy to capture the data.

05:01.890 --> 05:05.556
See, it really wouldn't work with me at Widener, for instance, because my stack passes

05:05.722 --> 05:06.924
to take and read there.

05:06.944 --> 05:10.368
And if they let you take things out and Xerox them without checking them out.

05:10.408 --> 05:11.890
That's never going to be.

05:11.970 --> 05:12.250
Right.

05:12.371 --> 05:13.452
And I'll go in and do four or five.

05:13.472 --> 05:17.357
And I think that's one reason why Harvard comes out lower, is that Widener allows that.

05:17.377 --> 05:19.359
And it's a very unusual system there.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.341
And it's very expensive.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.502
It's twice as much.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.765
You get circulation, for sure.

05:23.785 --> 05:25.327
These are things I'm going to copy anyway.

05:25.387 --> 05:27.450
I may as well just do it while I'm in.

05:27.470 --> 05:27.690
Absolutely.

05:28.391 --> 05:30.334
Yeah, and you get a nice Widener copy card.

05:31.235 --> 05:33.838
But it's quite striking to me that, you know,

05:34.072 --> 05:41.026
I think the thing that makes for high circulation is graduate programs, of course, and senior theses.

05:41.827 --> 05:47.539
I can do a senior thesis group at Bates and Bates College, and one of the very few undergraduate schools in the country.

05:47.879 --> 05:48.440
That's right.

05:48.460 --> 05:55.354
I think that still requires a senior thesis.

05:55.874 --> 06:00.461
students are expected to do work from Princeton collections.

06:00.481 --> 06:03.265
So this is probably a course that it wouldn't be taught at very many times.

06:03.566 --> 06:08.994
Oh, you could teach it at any one of the top 12 or 15 American university libraries.

06:09.836 --> 06:17.027
And if you were in LA, you could teach it at the Huntington, or you could teach a later version at the Clark, not the one that I did.

06:17.147 --> 06:21.814
But you could teach it at Berkeley, Stanford, Michigan, Chicago, Columbia.

06:22.064 --> 06:34.601
If I were to tell you there's a brand new, and of course we're not talking about Princeton and the small colleges, which we've been looking at as well.

06:34.621 --> 06:40.849
There's a new college in Monterey Bay, set up by the California state.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.031
I'll be writing about it.

06:42.171 --> 06:43.853
They are now five years old.

06:44.035 --> 06:51.622
And if I were to ask you to give me a wild guess at how many books they have in my life, what would you say?

06:51.642 --> 06:53.384
This is a state university.

06:53.404 --> 06:53.564
No idea.

06:53.584 --> 06:55.166
Could you believe 34,000 writers?

06:55.186 --> 06:55.266
Huh.

06:55.366 --> 06:58.389
Would you find that shocking?

06:58.409 --> 06:59.410
I would find that shocking.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.893
Except for only five years, you know, you have to start somewhere.

07:03.333 --> 07:07.657
But they acquired 25,000 in the first year, so they only added 9,000.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.858
2,000 a year.

07:09.059 --> 07:12.642
But what they want, this is the same institution that said,

07:13.010 --> 07:14.893
They didn't want a library at all.

07:15.153 --> 07:16.355
They didn't even plan for it.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.397
Oh, right.

07:17.417 --> 07:22.063
And then there's a school down in Florida, which has 200,000 libraries.

07:22.204 --> 07:22.965
I guess it's up here.

07:23.025 --> 07:23.646
They went under.

07:23.846 --> 07:24.507
Right.

07:24.527 --> 07:29.314
They went and bought, at a fire sale, $450,000 worth of books.

07:30.356 --> 07:37.386
But it is the intention of the president there to have a library, he says, which is no bigger than a telephone book.

07:37.406 --> 07:41.953
I guess what I'm driving at is you do have institutions today, accredited institutions,

07:42.220 --> 07:44.443
that are planning to teach without books.

07:44.683 --> 07:46.966
I find this extremely sinister.

07:47.106 --> 07:48.067
I love this stuff.

07:48.087 --> 07:51.732
It's a great addition to what we do, and I'll tell you a couple of ways.

07:52.373 --> 08:03.967
First way, when I have a senior, and we are a mostly undergraduate place, even though we have a great, great graduate program in history and many other humanistic fields.

08:04.588 --> 08:11.316
When I have a senior who is doing, say, a 200-page senior thesis on 16th century texts on witches and Jews,

08:11.903 --> 08:16.750
She is going to need more than is here, even though we have a lot of microphone holdings to add to what we do.

08:17.251 --> 08:19.975
So we sit and we go visit Harvard.

08:20.576 --> 08:25.663
And it's actually faster to get into Hollis than it is to Princeton from my office.

08:25.683 --> 08:30.851
And so each of my students, we go to Yale, we go to Columbia, we go to New York Public.

08:30.871 --> 08:32.854
We plan their trips in this office.

08:33.354 --> 08:36.820
And they all have friends at the other colleges with boards they can sleep on.

08:36.940 --> 08:38.502
And it's fantastic.

08:38.752 --> 08:43.577
Twenty years ago, when I supervised senior theses, trying to do this kind of planning was well-nigh impossible.

08:43.597 --> 08:49.282
Even out of the National Union catalog, it was so imperfect, and you couldn't get fully reliable information.

08:50.043 --> 08:53.606
And this has just transformed that kind of teaching.

08:53.626 --> 08:59.091
One of my seniors this year went to Europe to do archival work for a month for her thesis.

08:59.972 --> 09:06.058
And because she wasn't working in state archives, but mostly in college and university archives, they all had web pages.

09:06.578 --> 09:19.158
in England and France alike, and she arrived at my door two weeks before leaving with email permissions from every archivist and librarian, appointments for using these places, all of a sudden before she'd ever set foot out of the country.

09:19.379 --> 09:19.659
That's right.

09:19.679 --> 09:23.906
I'm happy to be experiencing the same thing and setting up my trips and going abroad.

09:24.307 --> 09:28.333
And you no longer have to just show up and knock and hope there's no more.

09:28.634 --> 09:32.379
This meeting was set up entirely electronically.

09:32.459 --> 09:34.181
Absolutely.

09:35.083 --> 09:35.583
A letter.

09:35.603 --> 09:36.184
And here it is.

09:36.264 --> 09:36.605
Perfect.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.888
We're here at the right time.

09:38.988 --> 09:41.531
And I don't see any loss here.

09:42.412 --> 09:44.315
Okay, I have four seniors this year.

09:45.196 --> 09:48.520
And each one of them is writing a thesis, 100 to 200 pages long.

09:48.761 --> 09:49.922
Big project for 2021-year-old.

09:51.244 --> 09:54.268
Now, this is the point where people begin to worry me.

09:54.288 --> 09:57.392
They talk about how you can just supervise that electronically.

09:57.929 --> 10:07.658
And I insist, when I have a senior, that senior's in here once a week, for only 20 minutes, but once a week, to show his or her face and say, hi, this is what I've been doing.

10:07.738 --> 10:19.829
Now, I will do, I answer every email, and I probably, in the height of it, I'm probably getting five or six a week from each of them, with specific queries or with problems or whatnot.

10:19.929 --> 10:25.394
But I think it has to be in elite education, and in any education, ideally.

10:25.995 --> 10:27.396
But for what we're charging,

10:27.882 --> 10:34.888
Email is something you add on to enrich and make better the contact you have face-to-face.

10:34.908 --> 10:38.271
You start replacing face-to-face contact with email contact.

10:38.351 --> 10:43.256
And as for me, you could nail the door shut in my office and I'll hand it out like I'd never want to do that.

10:43.276 --> 10:51.904
And of course, serendipity, again, last week, last Friday, I went in to read a book that I couldn't get on interlibrary loan anywhere else in New England.

10:51.924 --> 10:54.946
It's The History of the Durham Cathedral Library, 1911.

10:55.407 --> 10:55.947
Terrific book.

10:55.967 --> 10:56.708
I've been there.

10:56.728 --> 10:57.889
This is part of my opening.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.286
And I've got to read this book.

10:59.306 --> 11:01.108
Well, Harvard has it, thank goodness.

11:01.128 --> 11:01.569
I go in.

11:02.170 --> 11:07.716
But the far more interesting book was the one that was three volumes to the right that I'd never heard of.

11:07.896 --> 11:14.184
Ernest A. Savage and the history of the reading in the Middle Ages.

11:14.504 --> 11:19.510
And my students love, and don't just like, they love their books.

11:19.530 --> 11:21.412
Every student I work with closely.

11:21.432 --> 11:21.953
That matters.

11:22.169 --> 11:45.460
That every student that I have real relations with is a book lover. As intensely as any students I've known in my 25 years and been in the business, they love books, they read books, we swap fiction recommendations, they go to bookstores, they find bizarre and wonderful things, and bring them in to show me. You know they

11:45.777 --> 11:54.330
They're book lovers, and the ones who are most skilled in this are often the ones who are most lovers of traditional books and smelly secondhand bookstores.

11:54.350 --> 11:56.853
I've heard of good secondhand bookstores here in Princeton.

11:56.873 --> 12:03.463
Well, there's a variety of syncretic ones called Witherspoon in a basement down at the far end of Axel Street, which is always worth visiting.

12:03.483 --> 12:06.247
You never know where the plan is.

12:06.367 --> 12:09.672
And then McCauver, the little one across from it, is expanding.

12:09.712 --> 12:13.658
They just had a superb art history collection, which I bought many things from.

12:13.638 --> 12:15.741
So again, you're never in an academic town.

12:15.761 --> 12:19.527
You never know who there's death, who there's hope.

12:19.707 --> 12:24.374
But no, my students here, they are real lovers of books.

12:24.754 --> 12:32.686
And it's actually, especially since I first taught this undergraduate course, I hear from them about it more than I have.

12:32.706 --> 12:33.547
Did you get into this?

12:33.668 --> 12:36.251
Is this a sideline to what you do?

12:36.392 --> 12:37.453
It's a sideline.

12:37.533 --> 12:41.679
I've always been interested in history of reading and annotated books.

12:41.780 --> 12:43.442
I mean, I've talked about it in my

12:43.793 --> 12:48.262
Gallagher books from the 80s and early 90s.

12:49.385 --> 12:57.541
It was really my friend Lisa Jardine, a wonderful book.

12:57.621 --> 12:58.804
She's a very old friend.

12:58.864 --> 13:02.031
We knew each other as students.

13:02.231 --> 13:04.215
She came here in

13:04.550 --> 13:16.787
the 80s as a fellow in my department for a semester, and we worked together on a project on Gabriel Harvey, a friend of Edmund Spencer, who left a lot of books with very rich annotations, some of which are here.

13:17.247 --> 13:24.577
And we did an enormous article together, which was published in 1990, and has had a very big influence.

13:24.677 --> 13:34.050
It's called Read for Action, How Gabriel Harvey Read His Libby, and it's in the general past and present from 1990.

13:34.891 --> 13:59.633
actually it's an article or a book it's an article but quite a substantial past and present is the journal for 1990 and and that's had a big impact that article it's become something of a classic because it was one of the first studies of an individual reader um that really tried to show how reading could be looked at in great detail on the basis of what evidence we have which you continued with the

14:00.457 --> 14:02.479
the talk that you gave last year.

14:02.539 --> 14:02.699
Yeah.

14:02.739 --> 14:03.179
Wonderful.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.080
Thank you.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.001
And with other things.

14:05.121 --> 14:14.990
And so what I'm hoping to do eventually is, A, to continue the teaching, which I really enjoy, and I find for ways we might want to talk later on about this.

14:15.531 --> 14:23.038
One of the things I've noticed going around the world is that the history of books has become a hot teaching subject everywhere in the last 10 years.

14:23.258 --> 14:28.843
I spent June in Israel, and in every Israeli university there's now a history of books, of course.

14:29.330 --> 14:32.934
Do you have some names to recommend?

14:32.954 --> 14:38.220
Yeah, Gadi Al Ghazi, he'll be in Berlin at Tel Aviv, and there's a couple of people at Haifa.

14:38.661 --> 14:40.903
But it's all of a sudden, it's an email.

14:40.923 --> 14:47.170
Gadi Al Ghazi, he's got a wonderful web page at the University of Tel Aviv.

14:47.190 --> 14:51.735
And the web page, you guys can check it out.

14:51.755 --> 14:55.500
I can always ask him in an email, but I'll give it to you and I'll check it.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.721
I'll give it to you right now.

14:57.275 --> 15:00.900
It's maybe even better than Jim O'Donnell's.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.345
I just did an interview with Jim O'Donnell.

15:04.365 --> 15:05.847
Did you read this in the book?

15:05.867 --> 15:09.393
I'm reviewing it.

15:10.134 --> 15:11.536
Here it is.

15:11.716 --> 15:15.001
HTTP, because this will give you an email.

15:15.021 --> 15:26.337
HTTP colon, backslash, backslash, Spinoza, period, TAU, period, AC,

15:27.042 --> 15:39.744
period, IL, backslash, tilde, that little sort of horizontal thingy, Algazi, A-L-G-A-Z-I, and then another backslash.

15:40.445 --> 15:43.550
And this is fantastically interesting.

15:43.570 --> 15:50.923
So what you have, I think, is a clear sense around the world that this is not just a scholarly approach that pays off,

15:51.342 --> 15:53.785
It's also a teaching approach that seems to work.

15:54.026 --> 15:56.890
Is the approach a factual role?

15:56.910 --> 16:00.755
I hope it's more than just an artifactual interest in books.

16:00.775 --> 16:02.638
Oh, I think it's much more.

16:02.658 --> 16:06.964
It seems to me that it's partly the way we are now.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.847
What do cultural journalists cover?

16:08.887 --> 16:10.469
They cover cultural journalism.

16:10.509 --> 16:12.071
How a story gets done.

16:12.191 --> 16:14.214
How the story went becomes the story.

16:15.376 --> 16:20.623
The Stephen Glass story rapidly turned into the story of how Stephen Glass was covered.

16:20.738 --> 16:21.999
by other journals.

16:22.299 --> 16:30.387
We're interested, I don't know why, it's the spirit of the age, but we're interested in how things are packaged, how they are diffused, how they are sold.

16:31.728 --> 16:37.994
And when you start asking those questions, students become excited, and they begin to read in a new way.

16:38.454 --> 16:40.756
Doesn't mean that they don't read the text with love.

16:40.857 --> 16:43.559
They just read it with a different kind of spectacle.

16:43.879 --> 16:47.843
I tell you, I did a LexisNexis search on you, and I always

16:48.430 --> 16:51.454
How often are you writing for them?

16:51.594 --> 16:55.979
Once or twice a year.

16:56.179 --> 16:59.503
I write for the New York City and the New Republic.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.205
I love writing for the New Republic.

17:02.206 --> 17:06.031
They always give you the word count.

17:06.071 --> 17:08.474
I know, they're incredible.

17:08.534 --> 17:13.300
Leon always says, I want people writing about the modern world as if it was the Middle Ages.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.421
That's a wonderful quote.

17:15.008 --> 17:17.793
I left to write for him, a great editor.

17:17.813 --> 17:22.202
In fact, I'm going to be reviewing Jim O'Donnell for them.

17:22.743 --> 17:29.395
I had a very interesting conversation with him.

17:29.636 --> 17:33.102
I think he is a great scholar.

17:33.233 --> 17:57.013
I am a good scholar. He is a great. No no no false modesty. As a friend of mine used to say, false modesty is better than none. But no no Jim's Augustine is going to be on the shelves in a hundred years and it's still going to be getting worn out in its fourth finding because it is a work that no one studying Augustine in a hundred years is going to be able to be without. That is an extraordinary level of achievement. I don't I think agree with him a lot on

17:57.500 --> 17:59.883
media and many issues in the history of reading.

18:00.003 --> 18:03.527
But I think that he is an extraordinary scholar.

18:03.607 --> 18:09.514
He is particularly interesting in that he's involved quite actively in computers at the university.

18:09.754 --> 18:13.619
By the testimony of everybody I know of him does a superb job.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.481
But he loves it.

18:16.442 --> 18:19.506
Everything is on his webpage.

18:19.626 --> 18:21.628
The students are required.

18:23.290 --> 18:25.633
He wants them to come to him.

18:25.985 --> 18:28.569
My conversation with him was totally set up.

18:28.650 --> 18:33.538
And if he could have done it by email, I think he probably would have rather have done it that way.

18:33.558 --> 18:42.794
Well, I think he has more confidence in the virtual that I do for teaching.

18:42.894 --> 18:43.636
I love this stuff.

18:43.696 --> 18:44.698
I use it all the time.

18:45.058 --> 18:49.005
It's wonderful to keep in touch with my students when they're in Europe or when I'm in Europe.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.187
I really like that.

18:50.656 --> 18:56.905
But it is a supplement to real teaching, which takes place in a setting like this, and there's just no other way.

18:57.286 --> 19:00.430
You start, and you say, hot.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.854
The very first sentence, reading is hot.

19:02.874 --> 19:05.197
What accounts for that, do you think?

19:05.217 --> 19:06.680
Oh, I think I can.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.364
Does the paradigm shift have anything to do with that?

19:09.384 --> 19:11.887
Well, there is some kind of paradigm shift, isn't there?

19:12.388 --> 19:19.819
It has to do with our belief that everything can be exposed, that there's always a mechanism underneath that accounts for things.

19:20.525 --> 19:26.814
You know, that a book is canonical not because it's a great book, but because someone made it canonical.

19:27.655 --> 19:28.897
We're suspicious these days.

19:29.277 --> 19:35.786
And the history of reading, I think, is very much about asking what were the mechanisms that made this what it was.

19:37.228 --> 19:39.411
So that, I think, has had a big impact.

19:39.965 --> 19:47.739
Students, it is true, they love to read, but they have less technical equipment for reading than students did in my generation in college.

19:47.759 --> 19:48.861
What do you mean like that?

19:48.881 --> 19:53.809
I mean that we spent four years in high school reading poems and doing new critical analysis.

19:55.492 --> 19:58.277
We memorized poetry, we recited poetry.

19:58.662 --> 20:01.806
But we all said, why did the poet use this metaphor?

20:02.466 --> 20:06.771
Are you grieving over a golden grove?

20:06.871 --> 20:08.253
Are you leaving?

20:08.273 --> 20:13.058
Analyzing that word by word for hours, day after day in class.

20:13.078 --> 20:19.225
We were reading, as I recall, Hopkins, Eliot, Dunn in high school English classes, and very closely.

20:19.345 --> 20:20.687
Not always well, of course.

20:20.937 --> 20:22.499
but closely in art.

20:22.879 --> 20:27.544
Students do not come to college with that kind of training in reading anymore.

20:27.564 --> 20:28.986
Do you do video work with them?

20:29.246 --> 20:30.007
Well, of course.

20:30.027 --> 20:37.215
And as the great Otto Neudebauer, the great historian of ancient science used to say, no system of education could ruin everybody.

20:37.295 --> 20:43.382
So there are always people who could read just because they can't do anything else, and they have to read.

20:43.402 --> 20:48.227
And there are always people who fall in love with good writing, and students, a few, who are just

20:48.528 --> 20:50.270
Superb, wonderful writers.

20:50.590 --> 20:53.113
Wonderful, wonderful writers.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.835
Sightseeing.

20:55.015 --> 20:55.676
Absolutely.

20:56.456 --> 21:02.943
One of the great things about teaching in a place like this is that your best students are so much abler than you are.

21:02.963 --> 21:03.284
Oh, come on.

21:03.304 --> 21:03.624
No, no, no.

21:03.704 --> 21:04.525
It's true.

21:04.645 --> 21:05.987
It's certainly that you work.

21:06.828 --> 21:12.814
The kind of stuff they do here at 21 remotely not.

21:13.182 --> 21:14.463
are coming in with fewer.

21:14.663 --> 21:16.985
Because they move fast.

21:17.005 --> 21:18.507
There's no baggage to carry.

21:18.547 --> 21:20.569
They learn very quickly.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.991
They write wonderfully at the top.

21:23.011 --> 21:27.795
And they do love reading and writing.

21:27.815 --> 21:29.817
At the same time, they have fewer tools.

21:30.518 --> 21:36.283
But at the same time, they find that an approach which says, well, who made this book?

21:36.723 --> 21:37.944
What does it take to make a book?

21:37.964 --> 21:42.008
It clearly doesn't just take somebody sitting in her room writing with a full pen.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.011
That somehow works for them.

21:44.191 --> 21:45.274
It gets them thinking.

21:45.294 --> 21:46.156
It gets them working.

21:46.177 --> 21:47.540
It's charged up.

21:47.560 --> 21:57.786
It gets incredible research papers done in ways that, in my experience, more traditional approaches don't necessarily.

21:58.272 --> 22:03.698
But when you say reading is hut, it's not just hut on the university campus.

22:03.838 --> 22:05.400
It seems to be hut everywhere.

22:05.420 --> 22:05.720
Everywhere.

22:05.740 --> 22:15.670
I mean, we've been building, that is to say, both virtual and material palaces of reading in the last 10 years, like nothing that America has ever seen before.

22:15.690 --> 22:22.778
And if you, what was the old joke, if you laid every Grinmore poet end to end, you know, if you laid every Barnes & Noble and Borders end to end,

22:23.230 --> 22:27.855
You know, how many acres of sold wood annealing and cappuccino machines?

22:27.995 --> 22:29.356
Well, what's the fence like?

22:29.376 --> 22:30.097
It's been larger?

22:30.117 --> 22:30.918
I don't know.

22:31.018 --> 22:34.261
It sounds pretty funny.

22:34.281 --> 22:35.442
Yeah, I've never known.

22:35.503 --> 22:37.144
It's a, you know, it's funny.

22:37.164 --> 22:37.765
Yeah, I know.

22:37.785 --> 22:39.386
It's very, very incorrect, too.

22:39.587 --> 22:43.631
But, you know, from the terminology, I think I quoted it accurately.

22:43.751 --> 22:45.333
It must come from the thirties.

22:45.353 --> 22:47.034
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:47.054 --> 22:52.680
Also, the student is being a bit depressed today.

22:52.829 --> 23:03.020
Yeah, we like Harvard, who are the only place to get even more of the people they have met than we do.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.708
We really are getting a wonderful class.

23:05.924 --> 23:11.171
Now, it is true that reading is not as well taught in America as science.

23:11.191 --> 23:12.032
How do you teach reading?

23:12.092 --> 23:14.335
Do you teach reading?

23:14.495 --> 23:20.163
Yeah, you get kids in a room and you read with them and you ask them what they're finding and you try to keep an open mind.

23:20.423 --> 23:27.933
You try to give them tools for analyzing syntax and paragraph structure and plot.

23:28.153 --> 23:30.236
You can't teach someone to be a great reader.

23:30.256 --> 23:31.037
You can teach skills.

23:31.388 --> 23:36.633
I was Paul lost skills when I was young and taught more in Latin and Greek class.

23:36.733 --> 23:40.777
I don't feel that people have had these tasks going to them in the same way.

23:40.797 --> 23:41.297
You mentioned it.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.199
How do you pronounce the French scholar?

23:43.219 --> 23:43.860
His name was S.A.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.661
Boudet.

23:44.801 --> 23:47.523
I've never heard of him before.

23:47.764 --> 23:50.907
In France, he's a celebrity.

23:51.827 --> 23:56.672
What you describe here is a man of some tremendous stature and substance.

23:56.692 --> 23:57.733
Absolutely.

23:58.422 --> 24:02.346
I'm really impressed that books, and again, you talk about paradigm shifts.

24:02.366 --> 24:03.847
He has books and manuscripts.

24:03.867 --> 24:04.988
He has printed books.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.132
You call them hybrids.

24:08.212 --> 24:09.613
I don't know what you call them, hybrids.

24:09.713 --> 24:14.478
Yeah, because he takes the printed books and makes manuscripts out of them.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.199
I love that.

24:15.239 --> 24:23.747
I love this period when people are really cutting across the borders in all sorts of interesting ways.

24:23.767 --> 24:27.771
Again, I find this is something that students really find quite fascinating.

24:28.122 --> 24:36.172
What I did with my undergraduates, when I taught this history of books course, I was undergraduate.

24:36.192 --> 24:40.638
The work that they did, I don't actually know how it happened.

24:40.658 --> 24:53.674
One of them, a sophomore, took Mrs. Thrail's copy of the Tablet, which is in Catterstown, transcribed all of her manuscript notes, which were mostly notes about remarks on the city of London and her youth.

24:54.262 --> 25:06.245
And compared the way she used the book to reminisce about her youth with the way the authors in the Tattler talked about the city of London, not many sophomores around the country are doing things like that.

25:06.345 --> 25:08.008
And again, that only could be done here.

25:08.309 --> 25:11.094
Yeah, again, or at Harvard, but nowhere else.

25:12.156 --> 25:15.763
And one who did the most extraordinary.

25:17.009 --> 25:35.177
We have in the rare book documents no one's ever going to be able to use in publication, at least for many years, the archive of Ian Hamilton's biography of Salinger, with the letters of the suppressed version and with his correspondence.

25:35.437 --> 25:38.822
I read your books, and I did not get a set of those.

25:38.982 --> 25:41.987
They were around for a while.

25:43.250 --> 25:48.658
I'm usually pretty persuasive in publishing houses.

25:48.678 --> 25:53.886
We have proofs, we've got his diary, we have all the correspondence he carried on.

25:54.587 --> 26:07.367
I had a brilliant student who has been living in Germany this year, who had a particular strong sense that literary biography has practiced in America

26:07.685 --> 26:13.933
very problematic genre, one that he felt is basically of interest more than anything else.

26:14.053 --> 26:17.397
Not as everyone does it, but as most people do it.

26:17.417 --> 26:23.345
The big fat book about the poet, which is mostly about property, prices, and sex lives.

26:23.365 --> 26:26.789
And he said, well, here's Hamilton's more literary than most of the people who write these.

26:27.310 --> 26:31.996
I'm going to reconstruct how he wrote it and see what a literary biography is.

26:32.136 --> 26:33.658
This is Hamilton's stuff that came in?

26:33.678 --> 26:35.140
Yeah.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.882
No, no, no.

26:36.862 --> 26:43.111
No, but we do have some salariana which can't be used.

26:43.131 --> 26:45.534
But the Hamilton stuff was just fascinating.

26:45.594 --> 26:50.521
The devastating paper was very sharply critical of Hamilton.

26:50.581 --> 26:54.927
And just done with a rich body of primary sources to draw on it.

26:54.947 --> 26:59.173
It occurs to me that now, you mentioned earlier that Princeton is largely an undergraduate institution.

27:00.495 --> 27:03.399
You have extraordinary special collections here.

27:03.419 --> 27:06.143
Are these special collections there then, do you think?

27:06.697 --> 27:10.903
For the most part, they're the undergraduate students.

27:10.923 --> 27:11.564
Do they use them?

27:11.724 --> 27:13.326
Do you send them there to use them?

27:13.446 --> 27:14.428
Absolutely.

27:14.548 --> 27:21.117
I try to get undergraduates to use them as much as possible, and our graduate students also use them.

27:21.197 --> 27:26.264
Our graduate program, I should say, in history, for example, we're one of the smallest graduate programs.

27:26.404 --> 27:29.869
We have about 16 or 18 people each year entering.

27:30.271 --> 27:32.854
But we're an extremely good program.

27:32.874 --> 27:35.156
We're normally rated at the very top.

27:35.176 --> 27:42.084
And we are, if anything, even more selective for graduates than for undergraduates.

27:42.384 --> 27:45.567
And even more of them come.

27:45.587 --> 27:47.309
We accept 20 and 18 come.

27:47.529 --> 27:48.290
And they're very well-funded.

27:48.310 --> 27:50.332
They're very carefully chosen.

27:50.633 --> 27:59.502
And what we do with them in rare books and manuscripts is get them used to working with the material before they go abroad to do the massive work on their European dissertation.

28:00.899 --> 28:09.992
They're preparing historians who will be writers, who will be teachers, who will be... Yeah, who will mostly be professors of history, though a few of them will go on and do other things.

28:10.012 --> 28:11.374
Quite common, of course.

28:11.455 --> 28:20.568
Historians put a lot of store by writing well, not just intelligently, but without jargon, with some kind of passion and vividness.

28:20.588 --> 28:26.637
And many of the students who end up doing very serious undergraduate history and going on to graduate school

28:26.920 --> 28:28.842
also consider trying to be writers.

28:29.162 --> 28:32.265
It's a very, very common correlation.

28:32.285 --> 28:38.951
So at this point, I know this year, one of my seniors is going off to work in a magazine next year.

28:39.612 --> 28:43.256
A junior I know is doing a summer magazine internship.

28:43.276 --> 28:52.524
I've known a number of students who have gone to the best of all these jobs, which is the literary assistant of the New Republic, which is just a great thing.

28:53.445 --> 28:54.206
They get to edit me.

28:54.226 --> 28:55.307
It's very funny.

28:56.131 --> 29:03.082
To go back to that essay, you said you read for a couple of reasons.

29:03.102 --> 29:08.291
I really liked the second one in that you read to be a writer.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.638
Would you say in general that

29:13.411 --> 29:19.056
You can pretty much, I don't know, keep doing this properly, but he is a writer, a product that he's reading, I wonder.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.397
Absolutely.

29:20.417 --> 29:26.903
And you cannot be a great writer in any of the world if you're not a great reader.

29:26.923 --> 29:28.885
I had an interview with Roberto Echol for this book.

29:29.245 --> 29:37.212
Milan, you can see he lives, he's 30,000 books in there, and he's wonderful.

29:37.232 --> 29:40.535
And he just thought the question was, you know, basic.

29:40.796 --> 29:43.418
I mean, don't even, why bother ask?

29:43.634 --> 29:49.420
And he said, read Sartre's book, which I have, called The Wards.

29:49.540 --> 29:58.849
Sartre's writing about what shaped him as a reader to the age of ten, which is really very interesting.

29:59.970 --> 30:03.974
Were you shaped as a reader, would you say, as an adolescent?

30:04.054 --> 30:10.080
Before I was an adolescent, I became a historian reading two books, Virginia Woolf,

30:10.533 --> 30:11.074
and T.H.

30:11.094 --> 30:21.036
White's Once and Future King, both of which made me so fascinated with the possibilities of thinking historically and projecting yourself into the distant past.

30:21.056 --> 30:22.379
I never much wanted to do anything wrong.

30:22.399 --> 30:23.240
Fiction, though.

30:24.343 --> 30:24.443
Yeah.

30:24.463 --> 30:26.748
Fiction, but deeply historically informed fiction.

30:27.289 --> 30:28.812
But it's interesting that it was fiction.

30:29.073 --> 30:29.554
Oh, yeah.

30:30.074 --> 30:46.169
Actually, one of my students, again, passed on to me a wonderful short piece by Virginia Woolf, which I've never known, which begins with a fictional first-person account of a historian talking about a woman's diary from the 15th century.

30:46.189 --> 30:47.470
Yeah, and then it's a diary.

30:47.490 --> 30:48.191
Is it published?

30:48.211 --> 30:50.093
Yes, it's in her quite a short fiction.

30:50.113 --> 30:51.654
It's just wonderful.

30:51.674 --> 30:52.775
I've never known it before.

30:52.795 --> 30:56.959
I was really ashamed.

30:57.935 --> 31:03.401
But absolutely, I think fiction's power to call out the past is absolutely the part of it.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.805
How old were you with this epiphanous moment?

31:06.825 --> 31:08.707
Probably 10, 11.

31:08.727 --> 31:08.987
Really?

31:09.007 --> 31:09.648
Yeah.

31:09.688 --> 31:10.769
Were you always reading?

31:10.929 --> 31:11.229
Yeah.

31:11.390 --> 31:15.834
And are you still always reading?

31:15.854 --> 31:15.914
No.

31:15.934 --> 31:22.822
Is there anything that you... I asked this question of Harold Blum, and he was... I said, because apparently, if you think about this word, he reads everything.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.984
And I said, is there a book on the book?

31:25.004 --> 31:25.765
Is there a book?

31:26.420 --> 31:28.745
that you would like to read that you haven't had time?

31:28.765 --> 31:29.506
Sure.

31:29.526 --> 31:30.087
He said, no.

31:30.308 --> 31:32.472
He said he's read everything that interested.

31:33.514 --> 31:40.188
I'm not trying to respond to that, but I have to believe he reads voraciously.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.414
I read an enormous amount, but never as much about it as well.

31:43.554 --> 31:47.382
Do you still read fiction, honest and pleasure?

31:48.492 --> 31:52.137
Constantly, and let's say the last week, what have I read?

31:52.637 --> 31:58.685
Well, I read Lawrence Westler's Calamities of Edile, the three non-fiction novellas.

31:58.845 --> 32:00.126
Yeah, that's new, isn't it?

32:00.147 --> 32:00.247
Yeah.

32:00.267 --> 32:00.787
Is that our own radio?

32:00.807 --> 32:02.710
We did that, and quite a lot.

32:02.770 --> 32:03.771
Chicago?

32:03.991 --> 32:07.035
Yeah, the commercial places weren't interested in it.

32:07.315 --> 32:07.676
Too bad.

32:07.836 --> 32:12.562
And his book, his last book, with my book, we come up the same year.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.264
We're all finalists for that.

32:14.284 --> 32:14.945
Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:14.965 --> 32:16.207
They both did extortion them.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.229
But just on the strength of that, and he also was a

32:18.530 --> 32:24.364
I'm amazed that the commercial house didn't pick up on that.

32:24.385 --> 32:25.327
Well, I'm not.

32:25.748 --> 32:29.597
I mean, I think that most of the commercial houses are organic.

32:29.618 --> 32:33.467
And we go, you know, I've seen those and everything, so how did you do on the last one?

32:34.696 --> 32:37.981
But I, yeah, I would say I read that.

32:38.121 --> 32:39.523
Is it good?

32:39.623 --> 32:44.851
Yeah, it's wonderful.

32:45.372 --> 32:46.874
It's a nice man.

32:46.894 --> 32:47.295
Yeah, wonderful man.

32:47.315 --> 32:50.580
It's a stunning piece of writing.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.044
I just re-read Wallace Segner's Crossing to Safety, which is my favorite of mine.

32:53.064 --> 33:01.096
And I'm about to start a book, which, again, which a student gave me, called Straight Man by Richard Russo, which is a college novel.

33:01.116 --> 33:01.636
He went to Pobie, I think.

33:01.656 --> 33:02.037
Yeah, that's right.

33:02.320 --> 33:06.125
So that's like the last five days.

33:06.525 --> 33:08.908
Just the last five days.

33:09.269 --> 33:10.170
That's amazing.

33:11.131 --> 33:12.332
Pardon me for jumping around.

33:12.933 --> 33:14.335
This is great.

33:14.455 --> 33:16.638
Are you a collector?

33:16.658 --> 33:17.579
Do you collect books?

33:17.619 --> 33:22.485
I collect 16th and 17th century books in my fields of interest now.

33:24.527 --> 33:29.594
Stephen Jay Gould says, for instance, he needs to hold the actual book.

33:29.614 --> 33:31.416
It's something.

33:32.054 --> 33:34.678
describe what it is.

33:34.698 --> 33:37.061
But he can't do it from a facsimile.

33:37.081 --> 33:40.706
He has to... Oh, I don't like facsimiles.

33:40.726 --> 33:41.888
You don't mind him?

33:41.908 --> 33:44.531
No, I use a lot of facsimiles.

33:44.711 --> 33:46.414
I'm happy with microfilm and all of them.

33:46.434 --> 33:49.198
But I like to own the books when I can.

33:49.218 --> 33:51.000
Maybe that's just an excuse to bump me at once.

33:51.080 --> 33:51.401
Yeah, yeah.

33:51.421 --> 33:54.665
I do like to own some of them, but I don't.

33:55.526 --> 33:57.509
No, I've never felt that.

33:57.609 --> 33:59.732
I'm always really grateful to have a facsimile.

34:00.303 --> 34:12.442
I have to tell you, in November, I was in Venice, in Marciana, and handled that same text.

34:13.684 --> 34:20.334
And that's a book that's about 1,000, I don't know the years have started, 1,000.

34:20.354 --> 34:22.918
And that's the oldest extant text, I guess.

34:23.371 --> 34:25.013
Is that about that?

34:25.373 --> 34:34.104
Certainly the oldest extent, complete one, and then certainly the only one which has this information on how the Alexandrian scholars did it.

34:34.985 --> 34:47.499
And then apparently there are what really makes it very interesting are the invasions and the annotations and the references to works which can't be... Which we don't have, which have to be reconstructed from those references.

34:47.519 --> 34:53.226
But this is the kind of thing that you get from reading and reading and reading the annotations.

34:53.695 --> 35:01.806
Your book on footnotes, of course, you seem to be interested in every aspect of the book.

35:01.826 --> 35:03.408
Yeah, I really do.

35:03.548 --> 35:05.731
I'm just a book person.

35:05.751 --> 35:10.397
My next book, which is here, is on a Renaissance astrologer.

35:10.458 --> 35:18.268
Again, he tries to ask about what an astrologer's books are for, what different kinds of books he wrote, and how people use them.

35:19.075 --> 35:26.543
and also how his books reflect a kind of collaborative effort that his publisher had a big impact on him and so on.

35:26.563 --> 35:39.196
What other kinds, do you think that a hundred years from now, Tony Grafton's in the year 2080 or 90 will be able to tell similar things about his youth, for instance?

35:39.216 --> 35:46.143
I don't think they'll want to, but if they didn't want to... Well, as an example, from their reading, do you write copiously in margins?

35:46.303 --> 35:46.804
Very little.

35:47.797 --> 35:50.639
So this is something that really is of another time, isn't it?

35:50.659 --> 35:52.301
Well, it depends on the book.

35:52.341 --> 35:59.267
I just reread Middlemarch a few weeks ago, and I did find myself copying quotations from Middlemarch in the front of my copy.

36:00.688 --> 36:06.893
I noticed George Steiner in his book really urges people to write them in a book, and it's not a sin to write it in your book.

36:06.913 --> 36:12.878
No, no, it's an admirable habit, which I don't do enough, but I did find with George Eliot it was irresistible.

36:12.898 --> 36:15.400
There were things which I just couldn't stop myself.

36:15.420 --> 36:17.702
Are you familiar with Owen Gingrich's book?

36:18.712 --> 36:22.536
I'm writing about this, this is a beautiful book.

36:22.556 --> 36:23.677
He traveled the world.

36:23.758 --> 36:31.466
He's been 20 years trying to find every first and second, first and second, because he had understood that this was the greatest book never read.

36:32.307 --> 36:35.831
And, you know, but his study goes... On the contrary.

36:36.091 --> 36:41.617
Some very interesting people with some very interesting comments, which are preserved.

36:41.917 --> 36:42.518
Absolutely.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.280
And that's really what you're...

36:44.783 --> 36:46.265
Absolutely.

36:46.705 --> 36:54.315
It's one of the most interesting lines of investigation anyone's following in this film.

36:55.337 --> 36:57.439
You should get a sense of the people I've interviewed at.

36:57.980 --> 37:02.386
It really is covering just the most people I've tried.

37:02.406 --> 37:03.107
I'm happy to talk to you.

37:03.187 --> 37:06.351
Your books, by the way, and your writings speak most eloquently.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.475
It seems like I'm not questioning one.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.158
Yeah, of course.

37:13.519 --> 37:15.442
I really do enjoy these quotes.

37:15.462 --> 37:16.965
Do you know Father Boyle?

37:17.506 --> 37:28.585
He's working on a project, the Aquinas project, which could take two or three hundred years.

37:28.726 --> 37:31.210
Well, the Dominicans are patient.

37:31.595 --> 37:34.419
Is something like that an interview with 200?

37:34.439 --> 37:36.302
How do you justify 200?

37:36.342 --> 37:39.627
Because of the level of the crash they put in.

37:39.787 --> 37:41.530
It's the way you build a cathedral.

37:42.471 --> 37:46.077
It's slow, it's beautiful, it can't be done quickly.

37:46.518 --> 37:48.240
And what are they doing?

37:49.742 --> 37:52.366
Well, I mean, a client has had a horrible handwriting.

37:52.587 --> 37:54.750
Every word has to be deciphered.

37:55.253 --> 38:04.129
My understanding is that at the end, they'll have created the total, absolutely reliable base for Aquinas studies, which doesn't exist.

38:04.610 --> 38:14.849
And so, General, a priest up in Toronto, as a matter of fact, said, well, one of the reasons is that we're getting fewer and fewer people to connect them, you know, to join the brothers.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.093
Oh, it's a real problem, yeah.

38:18.085 --> 38:30.178
But then Father Boyle also indicated that he has a few people on the board, and he's really rigid in caution that some of the books that were published earlier, that they're saying now some of the scholarship might be flawed, and we have to do it all over again.

38:30.779 --> 38:31.980
He's like, let's wait a bit on this.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.683
He said, let's take a look at it.

38:35.344 --> 38:37.346
Can you give me a comment on it?

38:37.366 --> 38:38.987
Because I am writing about him.

38:39.007 --> 38:44.253
Oh, well, he is a wonderful man.

38:44.954 --> 38:47.957
I think he is one of the most

38:48.933 --> 38:55.483
generous and open custodians of great books I've ever seen.

38:55.503 --> 39:02.333
His heart, when he was Vatican librarian, was entirely with the readers and getting the readers to the material.

39:02.353 --> 39:08.642
And then, of course, he is the one responsible for bringing Iggy in and opening this thing up.

39:08.662 --> 39:09.203
Absolutely.

39:09.483 --> 39:12.147
He's a great opener up of a hidden thing.

39:12.167 --> 39:16.594
I gather there's going to be a big piece on him in The New Yorker in the near future.

39:16.810 --> 39:22.718
Even though he's working on it?

39:22.738 --> 39:25.862
Um... This evidence doesn't bother me, by the way.

39:26.803 --> 39:29.287
Is there other sources to say?

39:29.327 --> 39:29.867
Absolutely.

39:29.887 --> 39:33.012
There's further evidence that these questions are suddenly very interesting.

39:33.032 --> 39:40.101
Yeah, and this is often, you know, questions about why he's no longer the head of Wagner.

39:40.891 --> 39:45.737
Well, you know, the courts are our favorites.

39:45.757 --> 39:48.340
They talk because of the perceived politics.

39:50.003 --> 39:56.070
Every librarian or prefect has been named a cardinal, and he's probably more deserving than the whole lot of them.

39:56.351 --> 39:59.955
This is a genuine scholar.

39:59.975 --> 40:00.296
Oh, yeah.

40:00.316 --> 40:07.364
I went through there, and Peter was showing around, a very able assistant.

40:07.385 --> 40:08.586
It was quite wonderful.

40:09.123 --> 40:10.545
You are a person of the book.

40:10.966 --> 40:16.233
Do you consider yourself a book person, a person of the book?

40:16.253 --> 40:16.513
Absolutely.

40:16.533 --> 40:26.588
Yeah, it's on your floor to try to tempt and seduce students to be book people.

40:26.608 --> 40:37.423
Do you have any thoughts on deaccessioning of books, books that aren't read?

40:37.443 --> 40:37.543
Yeah.

40:38.097 --> 40:39.638
Are they moving books off campus?

40:40.259 --> 40:43.903
Well, off campus and deaccessioning are two different things.

40:45.204 --> 40:46.505
I worry about them both.

40:46.685 --> 40:54.793
Deaccessioning, I think, is criminal, because you're foreclosing the future, and you don't know what's going to look interesting in five or ten or thirty years.

40:56.034 --> 40:56.434
Hello?

40:56.975 --> 40:59.177
I didn't leave you here.

41:01.199 --> 41:02.780
That's possible.

41:04.682 --> 41:06.484
My secretary probably pulled it in.

41:08.877 --> 41:19.166
I think deaccessioning is terrifying.

41:19.487 --> 41:27.274
The previous librarian did occasionally things like 18th, 19th century PCs, which had been filmed.

41:28.134 --> 41:29.315
But I don't believe in that.

41:29.536 --> 41:35.281
On the other hand, using things out, I think, is a more complicated case.

41:35.401 --> 41:37.703
Well, the right story.

41:38.003 --> 41:39.424
because we can't avoid it.

41:39.444 --> 41:42.468
I mean, nobody has the room for everything anymore.

41:42.488 --> 41:47.112
One has to move some stuff off, but the result is very strange.

41:47.232 --> 41:55.461
What you get in Widener is a stat collection, which is a snapshot of the world of scholarship at the point where off-site storage started.

41:56.702 --> 42:03.529
And then I'm standing to check, a new passenger, by the way, and we go around and we're picking books together.

42:03.609 --> 42:04.770
He's explaining to me that

42:05.172 --> 42:11.139
the thinking that's going into my book as a candidate, and then I go out to the, I spent the day at this site.

42:11.279 --> 42:11.559
Right.

42:11.919 --> 42:20.349
But this is a very different matter from the Widener, which would give you the whole of scholarship brought together in one place.

42:20.369 --> 42:29.679
It requires electronic browsing, and I don't know about you, but I don't have any faith that electronic browsing is really ever going to replace browsing data.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.103
So you must have really been upset to see card catalogs.

42:33.792 --> 42:35.636
I like card catalogs.

42:35.836 --> 42:41.146
I also like computer catalogs, but they don't have remotely as much information.

42:41.166 --> 42:43.551
Does Princeton still think it's fair?

42:44.312 --> 42:46.336
Let me show you.

42:47.037 --> 42:53.089
We're in the worst situation of any major library.

42:53.129 --> 42:56.796
Not in every respect, but a catalog.

43:01.163 --> 43:04.607
It's a double interface.

43:06.148 --> 43:07.509
This is for the Library of Congress.

43:08.170 --> 43:13.295
Books, everything after 1980.

43:13.315 --> 43:16.118
They pulled out the name catalog.

43:16.138 --> 43:24.187
This is the card catalog, down to 1980, which was scanned in as a database, and which you can search in a very cumbersome way.

43:24.207 --> 43:27.350
When did you first publish a book?

43:27.370 --> 43:27.610
Ninety-five.

43:28.096 --> 43:29.498
Oh, wow, I'm sure up there.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.902
Yeah, but not in that pre-1980.

43:31.943 --> 43:33.665
Oh, let me see.

43:33.685 --> 43:36.610
Oh, this is the car.

43:36.630 --> 43:37.292
This is the car.

43:37.632 --> 43:41.599
I'll show you it in a sec.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.422
So you're finding friends in that.

43:58.792 --> 44:02.359
And so, yes, we're on, so you gotta go on.

44:02.439 --> 44:03.762
So they did scan an attack.

44:03.782 --> 44:04.503
It's the card.

44:05.706 --> 44:05.786
Wow.

44:05.806 --> 44:07.069
So it's a virtual umbrella.

44:07.249 --> 44:10.255
Well, that's pretty interesting.

44:10.275 --> 44:11.658
But it's very cumbersome to use.

44:11.678 --> 44:12.700
Yeah, I don't know.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.904
This is not a very common thing.

44:14.924 --> 44:16.107
No, it's an abortion.

44:16.247 --> 44:19.213
It's just like beta technology, which is similar.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.663
I've not seen it before I tell you a picture.

44:21.683 --> 44:23.785
No, you won't see it again.

44:23.805 --> 44:27.270
We're going to spend several million dollars to have a CLP.

44:27.691 --> 44:28.912
Just buy it.

44:29.513 --> 44:30.114
Here we go.

44:30.134 --> 44:35.160
Let me just take a quick look here.

44:35.180 --> 44:42.270
Do you have any thought on the record about the Colton Library over here?

44:42.730 --> 44:43.612
I really don't.

44:44.052 --> 44:48.458
Some of the material is quite fascinating.

44:49.214 --> 44:56.703
I confess I have doubts about whether it's really going to pay off as a scholarly election for us.

44:56.803 --> 44:58.405
But that's a strong off-the-record.

44:58.446 --> 45:01.049
He's a great benefactor of the university.

45:01.209 --> 45:05.254
I'd credit the university for dealing with it now.

45:05.334 --> 45:06.215
Are you critical thinking?

45:06.335 --> 45:07.637
Yes, I think that's right.

45:07.757 --> 45:18.090
I mean, there are other universities, I believe, that... Jesus, hi.
