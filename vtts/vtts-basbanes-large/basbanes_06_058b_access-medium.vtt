WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:05.153
Okay.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.075
We're talking about another man now, right?

00:07.115 --> 00:08.636
Not De Quersi Bales.

00:08.856 --> 00:10.618
De Quersi Bales.

00:10.638 --> 00:12.220
That's at NYU.

00:12.240 --> 00:12.380
Mm-hmm.

00:13.261 --> 00:19.106
The other man was Alfred Perrault, who was president of the Eagle Pencil Company.

00:19.126 --> 00:21.388
B-E-R-R-I-L-L, something like that?

00:21.408 --> 00:21.809
That's right.

00:21.829 --> 00:21.989
R-O-L.

00:22.389 --> 00:23.911
B-E-R-R-O-L-L.

00:27.434 --> 00:27.594
Yeah.

00:27.634 --> 00:33.700
He had a great collection, and he had a

00:34.152 --> 00:38.738
The finest collection of Alice, the original manuscripts.

00:38.758 --> 00:42.043
He had maybe a thousand letters of the author.

00:42.223 --> 00:43.204
Lewis Carroll?

00:43.224 --> 00:43.545
Yes.

00:43.845 --> 00:44.546
Thompson.

00:45.127 --> 00:46.309
Charles Dyson.

00:46.329 --> 00:46.669
Yeah.

00:47.030 --> 00:57.504
And he had every first edition in every language, in every, in French, in Italian, Greek, wherever they translated.

00:57.524 --> 01:00.288
He had all these thousands of them.

01:01.089 --> 01:03.332
And he also wanted to give it to a library

01:04.072 --> 01:05.915
where they'd give him a room.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.904
So I went to, I called up Bill Bond at Harvard.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.008
He came down and I brought him lunch.

01:15.029 --> 01:17.793
I told him, it's yours for the, you can have it.

01:17.813 --> 01:18.975
Here's the whole collection.

01:19.296 --> 01:19.917
Just give him a room.

01:20.498 --> 01:21.619
He said, we can't give him a room.

01:22.581 --> 01:24.544
Because this happens more often than not.

01:24.564 --> 01:29.432
Because if we start to give rooms, we won't have room for anything else.

01:30.293 --> 01:31.615
And so I said, well,

01:32.202 --> 01:33.323
So I left at Columbia.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.865
How long ago was this, would you say?

01:35.085 --> 01:41.131
Oh, I'd say eight years ago.

01:41.771 --> 01:46.476
So I finally, I didn't know what the hell to do with it.

01:46.496 --> 01:49.499
You'll excuse me for using it.

01:49.699 --> 01:59.428
You know, here was the wife and the son, and Harvard didn't want it.

01:59.488 --> 02:01.230
They wanted it, but they wouldn't give him a rule.

02:02.476 --> 02:04.720
The Columbia one, but they wouldn't give him a room.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.725
No, because Harrod wanted the books, but they wouldn't give him a room with his name on it.

02:07.745 --> 02:07.985
Right.

02:08.947 --> 02:12.653
It really came down to preserving it as a unit, as a collection.

02:12.673 --> 02:16.920
So I went back to my old stamping ground.

02:17.882 --> 02:23.811
I knew the dean of NYU very well, Dean Stone, and I brought him up to the house.

02:24.933 --> 02:28.399
He lived at Tapierre, right here.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.801
And I went down, and I found a little place there.

02:32.941 --> 02:35.824
It wasn't a room with four walls.

02:35.844 --> 02:37.205
It only had three walls.

02:37.305 --> 02:38.486
It was open space.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.509
But I remember putting the table.

02:41.589 --> 02:43.631
I bought a plank to put it on the table.

02:44.051 --> 02:45.573
And I brought the family down.

02:46.974 --> 02:49.957
This was Beryl and her son and her daughter-in-law.

02:50.617 --> 02:53.380
And they looked out on the park, and they were pleased.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.082
And I said, we'll hang a big photograph.

02:56.102 --> 02:58.324
You know, so they were pleased.

02:58.424 --> 02:59.365
And so it went there.

03:00.205 --> 03:07.114
You see, what you're doing now, what you're telling us, without really realizing it, is that you're doing much more than being a book dealer.

03:07.134 --> 03:07.495
Of course.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.897
You're not buying books or selling books.

03:09.197 --> 03:11.280
There's no profit involved here at all.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.523
What you're doing is good things, good works.

03:14.384 --> 03:14.644
That's right.

03:14.664 --> 03:21.614
And so even though you're not a collector personally, you are doing things with collections for future use.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.216
I've not seen this anywhere yet.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.579
I mean, am I on the right track here?

03:25.799 --> 03:26.500
Yeah, yeah.

03:26.921 --> 03:30.145
And it is a tribute to you that these people called you and said,

03:30.665 --> 03:31.626
Dave, what can you do?

03:31.687 --> 03:32.307
That's right.

03:32.748 --> 03:33.129
That's right.

03:33.509 --> 03:34.210
And what do you say?

03:34.230 --> 03:34.751
Let me think.

03:34.951 --> 03:36.233
In many instances.

03:37.335 --> 03:37.916
In many instances.

03:38.998 --> 03:40.840
And so what's the satisfaction for you there?

03:41.161 --> 03:41.481
Nothing.

03:41.561 --> 03:44.185
I know that it goes to a place where it's going to be enjoyable.

03:44.205 --> 03:45.107
Don't tell me nothing.

03:45.207 --> 03:52.898
I mean, I don't believe that you would go to all this trouble to bring these people from all over the United States to go uptown, downtown, midtown.

03:52.939 --> 03:55.422
Yes, and I spent money, my own money.

03:55.442 --> 03:58.226
I can't believe this.

03:58.267 --> 03:59.929
To get these books in a place

04:00.837 --> 04:02.000
to make them accessible.

04:02.160 --> 04:02.741
That's right.

04:02.761 --> 04:04.164
So you keep them as a collection.

04:04.906 --> 04:06.570
This is what book collecting is all about.

04:06.630 --> 04:14.046
As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I'll tell you a story about this Datsun's thing.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.449
There was a name, a name, a name.

04:15.469 --> 04:16.672
Rich thing there, what did you just call it?

04:16.692 --> 04:17.554
The what?

04:17.574 --> 04:18.376
Datsun, you know.

04:19.919 --> 04:20.280
Datsun?

04:21.138 --> 04:22.600
What's his name?

04:22.941 --> 04:24.904
Oh, I thought you said Beryl, I'm sorry.

04:24.924 --> 04:27.648
No, no, Dodson was the man who wrote Allison one book.

04:27.748 --> 04:30.092
Oh, Dodson, I'm sorry, yes, Lewis Carroll.

04:30.112 --> 04:30.753
Okay, Lewis Carroll.

04:30.773 --> 04:31.053
Lewis Carroll.

04:31.875 --> 04:31.975
Okay.

04:31.995 --> 04:36.301
There was a fellow by the name of Cohn that wrote two volumes on Lewis Carroll.

04:37.964 --> 04:41.830
And Beryl wouldn't give him access to, uh, to, uh,

04:42.738 --> 04:45.822
to the manuscript, to the material.

04:45.842 --> 04:46.943
He didn't like him.

04:46.963 --> 04:48.405
He wouldn't let him into the house.

04:49.046 --> 04:49.927
He threw him out, you know.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.129
That's a great story.

04:51.189 --> 04:54.754
So Gordon Ray was very friendly with me.

04:55.374 --> 04:56.836
I was very friendly with Gordon Ray.

04:56.916 --> 05:00.081
I sold him since he was a boy at Harvard.

05:02.484 --> 05:10.414
And when I got the stuff over to NYU, I called Gordon Ray, and he said, I'll get Cohen.

05:10.634 --> 05:12.036
He'll go up there and get the letters.

05:13.180 --> 05:18.245
And so he did, and he gave me a copy, inscribed a copy of the copy.

05:18.265 --> 05:25.032
See, that is a problem when you have private ownership to the point where they will not allow scholars to use the stuff.

05:25.392 --> 05:29.637
Now, one of the great things about the Scheide collection at Princeton is that it is used.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.217
It's used.

05:30.277 --> 05:31.859
They put it on Princeton University.

05:31.879 --> 05:34.121
It's given them a building, though they own it as a family.

05:34.141 --> 05:34.662
That's right.

05:35.082 --> 05:36.664
They allow scholars to come in.

05:37.144 --> 05:40.808
You have to demonstrate your need for the stuff, but then they let you use it.

05:40.889 --> 05:42.752
Henry Folger was terrible like this.

05:42.872 --> 05:43.192
Oh, yeah.

05:43.413 --> 05:46.878
He would never let people look at his Shakespeare statement.

05:46.898 --> 05:47.018
No.

05:47.038 --> 05:48.180
And he wouldn't even make statements.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.121
He just said, no.

05:49.922 --> 05:51.304
And what do you think about that?

05:51.324 --> 05:54.509
Then finally, Huntington kind of shamed him into doing it.

05:54.609 --> 05:55.030
That's right.

05:55.330 --> 05:55.931
Sure.

05:55.971 --> 05:56.552
How do I sound?

05:56.612 --> 05:57.514
Am I on the right track?

05:57.654 --> 05:58.134
That's right.

05:58.555 --> 05:59.517
How does my book sound?

05:59.537 --> 06:01.459
The stuff, the questions that I'm asking you.

06:01.479 --> 06:02.341
Very good.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.102
Am I on track?

06:03.202 --> 06:03.883
You're on track.

06:04.223 --> 06:05.005
Good.

06:05.025 --> 06:05.646
You're on track.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.850
We're going to go to lunch, by the way, at about 1 o'clock at the Pleiades.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.433
I've already made a reservation.

06:10.453 --> 06:10.693
Oh, you did?

06:10.943 --> 06:11.504
Is that all right?

06:11.924 --> 06:12.385
I don't care.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.126
It doesn't matter.

06:13.146 --> 06:14.568
Well, we want to take you to lunch.

06:16.010 --> 06:16.111
Yeah.

06:16.291 --> 06:19.616
And a random house is going to take you to lunch.

06:19.636 --> 06:21.318
So, anyway, where was I?

06:22.180 --> 06:24.183
How long have you been in this building, in this office?

06:25.845 --> 06:26.306
Eight years.

06:27.828 --> 06:29.911
And from, you came here from where?

06:30.131 --> 06:37.322
From, I was in, in 1929, I was at,

06:37.657 --> 06:39.659
Carnegie Hall, and I got the name.

06:39.679 --> 06:40.961
Oh, you were in Carnegie Hall?

06:40.981 --> 06:41.402
Yes.

06:41.422 --> 06:42.703
Now, tell me a little bit about this.

06:42.984 --> 06:45.186
I think we have to know this.

06:45.387 --> 06:51.975
I was on 59th Street at the time.

06:52.575 --> 06:53.436
You said 1929.

06:53.677 --> 06:54.798
This is 1928.

06:54.978 --> 06:55.239
Okay.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.164
So you were in business during the Great Boom.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.007
I was in business during the Great Boom.

07:02.027 --> 07:04.390
I was in business in the Great Depression.

07:04.690 --> 07:21.897
I went to see a friend of mine, a lawyer down at 165 Broadway.

07:23.500 --> 07:30.090
And while I was being announced by the secretary outside that idea, Jimmy Rosenberg,

07:31.842 --> 07:33.544
was coming out, and he saw me.

07:33.564 --> 07:35.426
He said, Dave, you're just the man I want to see.

07:35.946 --> 07:39.690
He said to the girl, he says, tell Ralph that I'm taking Dave with me.

07:42.133 --> 07:45.777
We got into a taxi, went up to the Asta Hotel.

07:46.157 --> 07:46.858
We had lunch.

07:47.479 --> 07:49.601
There I met another man, but the name of Simon.

07:49.921 --> 07:51.363
They had bought Carnegie Hall.

07:52.784 --> 08:00.333
And they didn't want a hamburger stand on the corner.

08:00.353 --> 08:01.714
What a great story, you know.

08:02.234 --> 08:03.816
This was just a quick fortune then.

08:04.016 --> 08:04.837
You happened to be there.

08:05.798 --> 08:09.021
And so I was doing all right.

08:09.101 --> 08:16.869
I had three or four hundred thousand dollars in the bank and I was pretty good then.

08:17.749 --> 08:29.541
And they took me up there and they said, look, you can have the place, make the rent very reasonable, thousand dollars a month.

08:29.561 --> 08:31.363
Of course this is 1928 though.

08:31.613 --> 08:41.945
I had a street level, and they put in a marble staircase downstairs, and I have pictures of it here somewhere.

08:41.965 --> 08:43.387
Big, it's a tremendous place.

08:44.989 --> 08:48.113
And it took me a year and a half to build it.

08:48.173 --> 08:51.777
I had everything made of walnut.

08:52.117 --> 08:57.724
It was the finest bookshop in America at that time.

08:57.744 --> 09:00.928
And I opened October 18th.

09:01.752 --> 09:03.634
And the crash came October 29th.

09:04.395 --> 09:04.855
My God.

09:06.097 --> 09:06.617
What happened?

09:07.398 --> 09:10.121
Well, I lost every dollar I had.

09:10.261 --> 09:13.584
I was there for four years.

09:13.745 --> 09:15.046
I had a 10-year lease.

09:16.908 --> 09:21.072
And I just couldn't stay there any longer, you know.

09:22.654 --> 09:26.878
So I came back to 59th Street.

09:26.898 --> 09:30.342
And I was there at 140 for 50 years.

09:31.250 --> 09:36.615
I pay $30,000 a year, then they raise it to $50,000.

09:36.635 --> 09:37.636
So I said, look.

09:37.656 --> 09:40.038
We're talking about 1933-34 now, right?

09:40.538 --> 09:41.159
That's right.

09:41.179 --> 09:41.339
Yeah.

09:42.660 --> 09:47.304
And so then I had a staff, five, six people.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.228
One of the men that was with me, I have a picture of him right there.

09:51.988 --> 09:56.512
And he got a stroke and I was alone and I said, the hell with this.

09:57.033 --> 09:59.755
Why do I need this big headache or pain?

10:00.157 --> 10:01.338
50,000 a year.

10:01.358 --> 10:02.239
50,000.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.703
So I came here eight years ago, eight, nine years ago.

10:06.723 --> 10:08.845
Never had any thoughts about retiring, I gather.

10:08.865 --> 10:10.327
No, I don't want to retire.

10:12.329 --> 10:13.190
Well, should I retire?

10:13.210 --> 10:16.212
I have a lot of fun.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.615
I have interesting people that know me.

10:18.975 --> 10:25.001
As a matter of fact, some of them called me this morning to wish me a Happy New Year, some people that I've known.

10:27.203 --> 10:29.185
And so this is my story of my life.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.172
Wonderful.

10:30.452 --> 10:33.897
I bet there's been some stories written about you in some of the New York newspapers that I use.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.361
Yes, yes, I have some here.

10:36.622 --> 10:37.242
They don't.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.885
Those are stories, you know.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.007
Well, I'd like to see some of them.

10:40.227 --> 10:43.332
Not from you, but I imagine you've been in the New York Times.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.395
I've been in the New York Times.

10:45.415 --> 10:47.258
If I were to check with the live movies.

10:47.338 --> 10:57.433
I had Whitman wrote a poem, a very famous poem.

11:00.653 --> 11:07.482
And I bought, many years ago I had this collector in Chicago.

11:07.502 --> 11:16.853
The original one is in the Library of Congress, which finally gave them.

11:16.873 --> 11:20.298
But this man wanted a copy of it.

11:20.318 --> 11:23.602
Oh, Captain, my captain.

11:23.622 --> 11:27.927
So I found one lady having one in California, San Francisco.

11:28.413 --> 11:35.243
And I wrote to her, and I called her on the floor, and I made an arrangement to buy it for $10,000.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.648
But she said, I don't want to come to New York.

11:38.709 --> 11:39.870
I'll meet you in Cincinnati.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.816
So I said, why Cincinnati?

11:44.597 --> 11:45.919
Why don't you come to New York?

11:46.681 --> 11:47.943
No, I'll meet you in Cincinnati.

11:47.963 --> 11:48.964
I said, how am I going to know?

11:49.204 --> 11:50.587
She said, I'll be wearing a red coat.

11:52.850 --> 11:55.534
So I come to the station to go to Cincinnati.

11:55.919 --> 11:56.840
I got to the station.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.144
I looked around for a woman in her earth coat.

11:59.164 --> 12:00.646
She's got a package under her arm.

12:01.307 --> 12:03.490
Sure enough, it was in a paper bag.

12:03.811 --> 12:05.533
There it was in a frame.

12:05.914 --> 12:06.495
I looked at it.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.176
It was all right.

12:07.236 --> 12:09.699
I had a check in my pocket, and I gave her the check.

12:09.719 --> 12:11.742
She went away, and I went back to New York.

12:12.564 --> 12:13.605
Now, how long ago was this?

12:14.286 --> 12:17.411
Oh, this must be 20 years ago.

12:17.431 --> 12:19.073
Did you fly out or take a train?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.535
I flew out.

12:20.555 --> 12:21.677
I used to fly all over.

12:22.558 --> 12:23.279
How did she come in?

12:23.299 --> 12:24.461
She flew in?

12:24.481 --> 12:25.082
She flew in, yeah.

12:25.636 --> 12:30.402
And so she, so I sold it.

12:31.384 --> 12:31.824
I sold it.

12:32.285 --> 12:39.515
And in his sale, it brought $15,000 in the Sang sale.

12:39.535 --> 12:40.035
Which sale?

12:40.376 --> 12:40.796
Sang.

12:41.117 --> 12:41.617
Oh, that's Sang.

12:41.637 --> 12:45.022
You mentioned it before, right?

12:45.042 --> 12:50.169
About three years ago, one came up in Doyle.

12:53.714 --> 12:54.715
And it had a letter.

12:55.808 --> 13:04.717
from to Whitman, asking him to write out the poem.

13:06.118 --> 13:21.493
And Whitman answered back, said, I'll charge you $2 for writing out the poem and $10 for leaves of grass, if you want $10 for leaves of grass.

13:21.513 --> 13:23.815
So that came up.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.697
I bet that did pretty good.

13:27.331 --> 13:35.659
I get a telephone call from a very prominent woman here.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.083
I don't want to mention any names.

13:39.143 --> 13:42.346
She said there were two items.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.990
There was this item and then there was another Lincoln manuscript.

13:46.771 --> 13:49.293
She said, how much would it take to buy those two items?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.878
I began to figure out.

13:54.280 --> 14:03.429
So I said, I don't know, three or four hundred thousand dollars, so you got it.

14:03.929 --> 14:14.159
But this is the, since you came, you must buy the first one, the manuscript.

14:14.699 --> 14:15.380
This is a woman now.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.242
I don't want to know her name, but this is a woman.

14:17.382 --> 14:22.627
This is interesting because women, they tell us, aren't really that important collectors.

14:22.647 --> 14:23.848
She said, that I must add.

14:27.338 --> 14:39.134
So I went to the sale, and this guy, what's his name, this from Fifth Avenue?

14:39.695 --> 14:40.336
Malcolm Forbes.

14:40.416 --> 14:45.082
Malcolm Forbes ran me up, and I paid $90,000 for it.

14:46.504 --> 14:48.146
He told me not to come back without it.

14:48.928 --> 14:50.370
I had $300 and something.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.893
So you had an open check, a blank check, they say.

14:53.374 --> 14:54.375
So I had to pay.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.879
I'm surprised Forbes dropped out, because he's got a reputation.

14:57.939 --> 15:04.788
Then I ran him up on the second one, because I had $300,000, and I only spent $90,000.

15:05.248 --> 15:10.195
So I ran it up to $240,000 for the other thing, and Forbes bought it.

15:12.017 --> 15:13.118
But she was very happy.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.343
And she said, send it up to Brown.

15:18.405 --> 15:19.347
Brown University.

15:19.367 --> 15:20.208
John Carter Brown?

15:20.308 --> 15:21.189
John Carter Brown.

15:21.349 --> 15:22.050
That's where it is.

15:22.823 --> 15:23.804
That's very interesting.

15:23.844 --> 15:27.428
Without knowing who the woman is, that's quite a noble thing to do, isn't it?

15:27.969 --> 15:32.013
She was willing to spend $300,000 not for herself.

15:32.214 --> 15:32.714
No.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.377
But she wanted that specific item, and then what she got is.

15:35.457 --> 15:39.462
Well, because it was too a relative of hers.

15:40.203 --> 15:41.824
The letter was a relative.

15:41.985 --> 15:43.887
I see.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.348
So that's where it is.

15:45.368 --> 15:48.372
So that's how the times wrote it up, you know.

15:48.432 --> 15:49.793
They did.

15:50.354 --> 15:50.434
Yes.

15:50.768 --> 15:53.590
But, I mean, those are the things that happen.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.754
You know, you've got to make things.

15:58.615 --> 16:00.917
How about disappointments, the ones that have gone away?

16:01.037 --> 16:02.238
Can you think of any of those?

16:02.258 --> 16:04.520
Oh, yes, there are lots of disappointments in my life.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.440
What can I do?

16:05.480 --> 16:07.822
At the moment, that's what you think.

16:08.643 --> 16:11.185
You know, there's no afterthoughts, you know.

16:12.106 --> 16:13.627
It's the drop of a hammer.

16:13.647 --> 16:16.570
It's gone, it's gone.

16:16.590 --> 16:20.353
But there's one question I have in mind that I haven't been able to

16:20.789 --> 16:24.374
and you may look into it.

16:24.394 --> 16:25.636
I think.

16:25.656 --> 16:26.036
Excuse me.

16:27.479 --> 16:28.220
I'm back on again.

16:29.041 --> 16:31.584
That's a personal collection or an institutional collection?

16:31.604 --> 16:32.005
Institutional.

16:32.966 --> 16:34.348
What institution is it?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.793
It's the Bronx High School of Science.

16:38.054 --> 16:38.354
Really?

16:40.036 --> 16:40.757
It's a high school?

16:40.858 --> 16:41.198
Yeah.

16:41.218 --> 16:42.079
And they've got a collection?

16:43.441 --> 16:44.883
They teach the Holocaust there.

16:45.124 --> 16:46.726
But they've got a collection to support it.

16:47.687 --> 16:48.889
That's very interesting, isn't it?

16:49.578 --> 16:53.783
You were about to say something, and I was on my fingertips here.

16:53.843 --> 16:56.466
One question I have in mind, you may look into it.

16:56.646 --> 17:00.130
You were about to say that when the phone rang.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.492
Oh, yeah.

17:02.512 --> 17:03.093
I don't know.

17:03.113 --> 17:05.916
I think there's a law.

17:06.216 --> 17:07.097
Now, I'm not sure.

17:07.157 --> 17:07.898
I'm not a lawyer.

17:09.520 --> 17:16.748
The price of the item is with the drop of a hammer.

17:16.768 --> 17:18.690
Now, when the English came over,

17:19.092 --> 17:20.233
Sotheby's came over.

17:20.273 --> 17:24.057
When Park Banay was here, they didn't have the 10% surcharge.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.220
John Marion put it in, your friend.

17:27.340 --> 17:28.261
John says he did.

17:28.621 --> 17:31.164
Well, he's not telling you the truth.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.046
Maybe I'm wrong on that.

17:33.066 --> 17:35.268
The English, the Sotheby's came over.

17:35.468 --> 17:37.690
Well, that's John personally, but I think Sotheby's put it in.

17:38.251 --> 17:38.651
That's it.

17:38.671 --> 17:40.133
Yeah, okay.

17:40.153 --> 17:41.053
Now, I don't know.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.377
If I was a lawyer, I'd dig into this.

17:44.517 --> 17:45.758
I don't know whether this is...

17:46.379 --> 17:53.888
I mean, after all, you buy something at auction, the drop of the hammer, $500, why would they pay $550?

17:54.669 --> 18:01.356
Why don't they say, you know, well, see, they're getting 10% from the seller and they're getting 10% from the buyer.

18:01.376 --> 18:03.218
Well, that's what makes the big business.

18:05.161 --> 18:05.261
Yeah.

18:05.281 --> 18:10.527
And when they go into competition for a big library, they can afford to take it with no commission.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.309
Because of the 10%?

18:12.329 --> 18:13.811
Because of the 10%.

18:13.991 --> 18:14.952
That's sold.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.623
That's already wound into the... It's factored in.

18:19.184 --> 18:20.105
You don't like that, I guess.

18:20.125 --> 18:20.826
I don't like it.

18:22.649 --> 18:22.929
Yeah.

18:23.009 --> 18:28.718
I just bought an old Parc Benet catalog track from the Jerome Kern II.

18:28.958 --> 18:31.462
I give you the name of every buyer.

18:32.323 --> 18:32.623
Really?

18:32.844 --> 18:33.785
Yeah.

18:33.805 --> 18:38.252
Now that I'm not talking about the 1929 Kern sale, I'm talking about one they had in 60, I think.

18:38.272 --> 18:38.813
Oh, yeah.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.134
Which is a very small one.

18:40.615 --> 18:43.960
But I noticed there that John Marion's father was the chief auctioneer.

18:44.227 --> 18:46.831
Lewis, he came up.

18:46.851 --> 18:49.075
I knew Lewis.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.341
I helped him become president.

18:52.361 --> 18:57.990
I remember when he came in as a boy, filling catalogs and envelopes.

18:58.010 --> 18:58.972
You're talking about John now.

18:59.212 --> 19:00.354
I'm talking about Lewis.

19:02.738 --> 19:05.182
John, I remember I used to push him in the baby carriage.

19:07.587 --> 19:10.251
Well, he's become the biggest auctioneer there is, isn't he?

19:11.615 --> 19:14.438
What do you think of the way the options houses have gone now?

19:14.478 --> 19:17.562
They're almost kind of cut out the dealer a little bit, aren't they?

19:17.582 --> 19:18.002
In a way.

19:18.262 --> 19:20.044
They're going straight for the collector.

19:20.064 --> 19:20.325
That's right.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.587
And that's not such a great trend.

19:22.607 --> 19:23.949
And that's not such a great thing.

19:24.770 --> 19:29.915
I mean, because the judgment factor, you get a dealer, and you're hiring his expertise and his knowledge.

19:30.276 --> 19:31.057
That's right.

19:31.077 --> 19:36.643
And, you know, but maybe the heat of the chase might... Well, it's a...

19:39.104 --> 19:42.689
It's very interesting, but I'm too old to do anything.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.932
I just sit now and wait.

19:45.573 --> 19:46.795
Let the parade go by.

19:47.756 --> 19:48.818
You're talking about the auctions?

19:49.459 --> 19:49.619
Yeah.

19:50.180 --> 19:54.065
So you go mainly to, because you... Well, I buy things.

19:54.225 --> 19:54.926
I buy things.

19:55.507 --> 19:57.790
But it sounds like it's good theater for you.

19:57.850 --> 20:03.238
I bought in the last sale, the bird sale for Bradley.

20:03.298 --> 20:05.441
I bought four or five groups.

20:05.581 --> 20:05.841
Really?

20:06.142 --> 20:06.242
Yeah.

20:07.775 --> 20:22.868
I'll tell you what I bought for the collection in the historical, not the Historical Society, but the other right next to it, the Museum of Natural History.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.370
They have an awesome object.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.751
It's supposed to be wonderful, yeah.

20:26.771 --> 20:28.633
Yes, and I bought it for them.

20:29.154 --> 20:34.178
Bobby Gillette wanted Bradley to give them the collection.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.600
Well, where the hell would they have to house it?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.626
For a collection like that, you'd make the room, though.

20:39.646 --> 20:40.447
Sure.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.751
I'm surprised Yale didn't go after it.

20:42.871 --> 20:44.673
Yale has the co-collection.

20:44.793 --> 20:46.095
That's right.

20:46.276 --> 20:48.839
But it's nothing compared to what Bradley's was.

20:48.859 --> 20:51.883
Well, Bradley's was supposedly better than anything in an institution.

20:52.124 --> 20:52.424
Right.

20:52.825 --> 20:54.647
Better than any institution is.

20:54.808 --> 20:55.128
Right.

20:55.689 --> 20:56.710
Which is unbelievable.

20:56.971 --> 20:57.231
Right.

20:58.212 --> 20:58.433
Right?

20:59.013 --> 21:00.175
Yeah.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.600
Go ahead.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.062
We could probably go earlier for dinner.

21:05.482 --> 21:08.626
I made it 1 o'clock, because I know you said you'd like to keep your store open until noon.

21:08.646 --> 21:10.888
No, I will leave here at 12 o'clock.

21:11.188 --> 21:11.909
Okay, you sure?

21:12.129 --> 21:13.791
I made a reservation for 1 o'clock.

21:13.871 --> 21:14.291
Don't worry.

21:14.311 --> 21:15.713
But they know you're down here, right?

21:16.273 --> 21:17.455
Yeah.

21:17.475 --> 21:18.956
I go there anytime.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.297
Good.

21:20.958 --> 21:22.920
I got so many questions I want to ask you.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.282
Go ahead.

21:24.302 --> 21:30.147
And I just hope that today's, if we don't get it all in today, are you going to mind if I come down again and talk to you another time?

21:30.168 --> 21:30.668
No, I don't mind anytime.

21:30.817 --> 21:33.781
My wife is very involved in this.

21:35.403 --> 21:41.771
Can you think of anything that you'd like that we haven't covered that I... Would you like to ask me anything?

21:43.453 --> 21:46.076
Don't be back here.

21:46.096 --> 21:46.737
I wouldn't bite you.

21:47.017 --> 21:48.559
Now tell me a little bit, if you don't mind.

21:48.820 --> 21:56.169
Now can I also... I'll just shut this off for a second.

21:56.189 --> 21:56.830
Geez, where was I?

21:57.070 --> 22:00.334
I had so many different categories here.

22:01.310 --> 22:05.415
We talk about what drives people to become collectors.

22:06.176 --> 22:11.462
I'm interested, Roger Stoddard, I don't know if you're Roger, at the Houghton Library at Harvard.

22:11.742 --> 22:12.043
Yeah.

22:12.063 --> 22:18.751
He said he'd be just as interested to know why people stop collecting, why they lose interest.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.434
And he mentioned Hornblatt, for instance, as one example.

22:21.975 --> 22:22.475
He didn't.

22:22.495 --> 22:22.635
Who?

22:23.136 --> 22:24.418
Harrison Hornblatt, you know.

22:24.638 --> 22:26.440
Oh, yeah, you, Harrison, very well.

22:26.858 --> 22:29.420
And he didn't actually mention Hornblood.

22:29.660 --> 22:34.044
I think he mentioned some guy from Providence who used to collect Shakespeare stuff.

22:34.465 --> 22:38.108
Some fellow from Rhode Island, I guess, who used to collect Shakespeare stuff.

22:38.128 --> 22:39.509
And I forget his name right now.

22:40.350 --> 22:47.156
But I guess Arthur Houghton would be another example, wouldn't he, of a guy who just put together a wonderful collection?

22:47.176 --> 22:48.937
Jerome Kern would be an example.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.459
Harrison Hornblood.

22:51.479 --> 22:53.461
Do you have any thoughts on that?

22:53.481 --> 22:55.583
I mean, you just get bored with the collection?

22:56.069 --> 22:58.172
Maybe they're not collectors, they're accumulators.

22:58.212 --> 23:07.384
Maybe that's part of the... But there were any number of collectors throughout the United States and Europe that were constantly buying.

23:07.524 --> 23:16.937
I mean, you know, you mentioned two or three, but there are several hundred people who are buying, but also selling.

23:17.698 --> 23:20.261
Also selling.

23:20.281 --> 23:21.823
The true collector then...

23:22.411 --> 23:25.794
You made the distinction earlier, an accumulator and a collector.

23:25.914 --> 23:26.214
Right.

23:26.935 --> 23:31.078
The accumulator is probably more disposed to sell than the collector.

23:31.218 --> 23:32.099
That's right.

23:32.119 --> 23:32.540
That's right.

23:33.020 --> 23:40.106
Now you've got it.

23:40.126 --> 23:40.767
Yeah.

23:40.787 --> 23:51.996
Are you familiar with, well, this gets into a question of ethics, I guess, and without naming, without even suggesting anyone in particular, but let's say you have a collector.

23:53.039 --> 24:00.225
who purports to be putting together a great library, let's say, of modern first editions.

24:01.387 --> 24:11.816
And a lot of the things that he gets, he gets with the understanding that his goal is to create a library that he will give, let's say, to the New York Public Library.

24:12.777 --> 24:16.420
And then down the road he decides, I've changed my mind and where to sell it.

24:17.381 --> 24:21.204
But do you think you still have a responsibility to the person you acquired it from in the first place?

24:21.625 --> 24:21.865
No.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.642
That's his own property.

24:26.243 --> 24:27.644
You have no responsibility.

24:27.945 --> 24:42.258
If you buy from me and say that you're going to give it to Brandeis, that doesn't mean to say that if you don't give it to Brandeis, that you've broken the law or something.

24:43.640 --> 24:49.185
I had a man in Chicago who many years ago, when Brandeis started,

24:51.140 --> 24:55.205
I was very friendly with Abe, very close.

24:59.390 --> 25:01.232
When they started, they were really poor.

25:01.252 --> 25:09.603
I mean, you know, the library started where the stables were and the manure was still on the floor.

25:10.143 --> 25:19.054
There was a man in Chicago who said he was very Jewish conscious.

25:20.519 --> 25:34.116
And he said to me that he'd like to establish a Jewish, for the library, a Jewish collection for Brandeis.

25:34.136 --> 25:41.064
And so, I remember buying a collection of Hebrew manuscripts.

25:45.290 --> 25:48.113
I think $20,000, I think, somewhere about that.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.204
So he paid for it, and I sent him up to Brandeis.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.327
And he sent him other things.

25:54.368 --> 26:01.358
But he didn't realize that Brandeis was not a particularly Jewish university.

26:01.378 --> 26:06.305
It had physics, it had history, it had biology, it had medicine.

26:06.325 --> 26:07.527
It was a true university.

26:07.547 --> 26:08.889
It was a university, you see.

26:10.291 --> 26:12.634
And so he stopped.

26:14.256 --> 26:16.159
And he put up a building in Chicago.

26:17.894 --> 26:22.781
And it's a little, a small college, a small... What's the name of the college?

26:25.165 --> 26:37.743
Again, this is on a small scale what I'm talking about, how the collector actually creates a research, a body of... Yeah, it's a nice little, it's a nice little... If you tell me his name, maybe I can find out the name of the school.

26:38.684 --> 26:39.706
It's in Chicago, right?

26:40.086 --> 26:41.108
It's in Chicago.

26:41.248 --> 26:43.311
I'll find out, I'm sure.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.563
They were in the, he and his brother's brother died.

26:48.623 --> 26:53.550
That's okay, I'll find it out.

26:54.771 --> 26:56.653
We talked about the auctions again.

26:57.174 --> 27:00.879
I guess it's a matter of pride now that you've attended every auction.

27:01.459 --> 27:06.346
Well, it's both pride and interest and my livelihood.

27:06.366 --> 27:07.587
Is it like theater for you?

27:07.667 --> 27:09.610
I mean, to see the drama.

27:10.731 --> 27:12.353
I sit in this big gallery and I

27:12.502 --> 27:14.745
I see the clicking of the currencies up there.

27:14.765 --> 27:19.171
I went to the Judaica sales, which was... Swan had that, maybe, no.

27:19.851 --> 27:21.233
You go down down to Swan's at all?

27:21.333 --> 27:25.359
I go, of course I go down to Swan's, whenever they have things that I want.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.942
I don't call that a first-rate house.

27:29.023 --> 27:32.227
That's a schlock joint.

27:33.028 --> 27:38.215
I won't quote that, I promise you.

27:38.235 --> 27:41.199
Okay.

27:41.219 --> 27:42.120
But...

27:43.450 --> 27:53.922
I went up to the gallery and I wanted to buy a very nice kiddush cup.

27:53.942 --> 27:55.104
Do you know what a kiddush cup is?

27:55.124 --> 27:55.344
No.

27:57.046 --> 27:57.627
Are you Jewish?

27:58.147 --> 27:58.588
We're Greek.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.189
The two of us, we're Greeks.

28:00.210 --> 28:00.890
That's all right.

28:01.010 --> 28:01.331
I don't.

28:01.571 --> 28:03.093
My sister converted to Jewish.

28:03.113 --> 28:04.354
I don't hold it against you.

28:05.295 --> 28:07.078
Your governor was Greek.

28:07.278 --> 28:08.880
He's married to a Jewish woman.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.803
He's married to a Jewish woman.

28:15.293 --> 28:16.314
I wanted to buy it.

28:16.334 --> 28:18.577
It was a very nice cup.

28:18.597 --> 28:23.302
Friday night, you make a prayer with Dwight.

28:24.604 --> 28:28.048
This was a little cup about this big.

28:28.068 --> 28:30.231
I gave my catalog away.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.393
And he's a collector, my son-in-law.

28:33.314 --> 28:36.538
He's got a pretty good collection of Judaica.

28:38.561 --> 28:43.366
Silver and bronze and things like that.

28:44.307 --> 28:44.828
Good collection.

28:46.175 --> 28:50.039
And I did it up to $12,000.

28:53.082 --> 28:56.365
He was away somewhere in the islands with his family.

28:57.126 --> 29:00.450
So I thought it was enough, you know.

29:00.890 --> 29:04.694
It was only about... I was thinking 50 years.

29:08.558 --> 29:12.522
And... What?

29:12.542 --> 29:14.824
I don't waste any time with those people either.

29:14.844 --> 29:15.405
I'm back on.

29:15.807 --> 29:18.410
You're talking about the cup, I think.

29:18.450 --> 29:21.973
No, I'll tell you, I didn't buy it.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.515
I went for $12,000.

29:24.176 --> 29:26.818
I thought it was enough.

29:26.838 --> 29:28.020
There was nothing else there.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.822
There was a picture there I thought.

29:30.102 --> 29:36.388
But I didn't like the idea of the picture.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.670
It didn't appeal to me.

29:37.690 --> 29:40.853
He was away, so I—but the cup I wanted to buy.

29:46.857 --> 29:50.502
But I go to these sales.

29:51.303 --> 29:53.125
There's something there that somebody likes.

29:54.046 --> 29:55.167
Did you know John Quinn?

29:57.290 --> 30:01.435
Well, he's a very important man in the history of books and collecting.

30:01.596 --> 30:03.218
Here's a little thing that I got in.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.283
In 1982.

30:07.543 --> 30:10.967
Can I look at it?

30:11.308 --> 30:11.548
Thanks.

30:13.975 --> 30:22.344
The special collection staff of the United States Military Academy Library would like to wish you a happy birthday and continued good health forevermore.

30:23.325 --> 30:35.819
You have been a true friend of the library, and not only has our collection grown from your generosity, but our lives have been enriched by the knowledge we have partaken from this date of 8 January 1982, Department of the Army, U.S.

30:35.879 --> 30:38.622
Military Academy, West Point, New York 10996.

30:38.682 --> 30:42.126
I'm just saying this for the sake of the tape recorder, and it's, uh,

30:42.376 --> 30:46.320
Addressed to you, Mr. David Kirschenbaum, Carnegie Bookshop, 140 East 59.

30:46.641 --> 30:48.203
That's when you're over in 59.

30:49.444 --> 30:52.648
When there's a, it's signed by half a dozen eight people.

30:53.188 --> 30:54.690
So it says your generosity.

30:55.531 --> 30:58.114
Oh, I felt good myself.

30:58.134 --> 30:59.996
And this is the government, of course.

31:00.016 --> 31:00.256
Sure.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.017
Why not?

31:01.037 --> 31:04.100
Help them in finding things, giving things.

31:05.202 --> 31:06.903
Well, what's your great satisfaction then?

31:06.924 --> 31:09.086
I have a sense that... I have good satisfaction.

31:09.306 --> 31:10.387
I'm happy with people.

31:10.808 --> 31:10.948
Uh-huh.

31:11.755 --> 31:12.596
And I get along.

31:12.716 --> 31:17.201
I never had a dissatisfied customer, everybody that I ever had, you know.

31:17.762 --> 31:20.605
Gordon Ray, I knew ever since he was a boy at Harvard.

31:20.726 --> 31:22.207
How old could he have been?

31:22.287 --> 31:24.850
He was maybe 20, 19, 20.

31:26.172 --> 31:27.834
I've known him until the day he died.

31:27.914 --> 31:31.458
As a matter of fact, I had lunch with him that day he died at night.

31:36.264 --> 31:37.585
And he never questioned.

31:37.665 --> 31:39.107
He came in that Thursday.

31:39.688 --> 31:41.610
I sold him a letter for $1,100.

31:42.113 --> 31:44.977
I put it down, and he looked at it, and he said, that's a very nice day.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.318
Put it in his wallet.

31:47.059 --> 31:51.985
He had a little briefcase, and I came back here after lunch, and I sent him a film.

31:52.006 --> 31:55.430
Usually that's the way I used to do it, because it's always sent him a bill, actually.

31:56.591 --> 31:57.733
And he died that night.

31:58.934 --> 32:00.516
Gordon, what was his name, Gordon Ray?

32:00.536 --> 32:00.817
Gordon Ray.

32:00.857 --> 32:02.999
He was the head of the Guggenheim Foundation.

32:04.001 --> 32:04.361
Oh, my goodness.

32:05.022 --> 32:07.485
How about the fellow who was involved in the theater?

32:07.545 --> 32:09.087
He just died a couple years ago.

32:09.187 --> 32:09.808
What was his name?

32:12.286 --> 32:14.448
He was involved with Aliyah Kazan.

32:14.468 --> 32:15.389
You remember the guy?

32:15.510 --> 32:16.331
Oh, yeah.

32:16.531 --> 32:18.253
He was supposed to be quite a collector.

32:18.333 --> 32:23.218
Years ago, I tried to make a collector of the motion picture people.

32:24.380 --> 32:25.821
Talking about 1928.

32:25.921 --> 32:31.267
I couldn't.

32:31.287 --> 32:31.508
Why?

32:31.548 --> 32:33.970
They didn't have any knowledge of it.

32:34.050 --> 32:40.317
I tried to make a library for Adolf Zucker, who I knew very well, intensely well.

32:40.518 --> 32:40.858
Really?

32:41.075 --> 32:42.237
And I was up there.

32:42.317 --> 32:46.322
I saw them a few things, but... They weren't interested?

32:46.342 --> 32:48.224
They didn't have the money, or they had the money?

32:48.244 --> 32:52.430
They had the money, but they had other things, you know.

32:52.450 --> 32:55.434
Geez, now we had an opportunity to meet up at Boston University.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.856
Do you know Howard Gottlieb up there?

32:57.176 --> 32:57.597
Yeah, sure.

32:57.677 --> 32:58.238
Nice man.

32:58.618 --> 32:59.319
Loved that guy.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.662
He's put together a nice little collection.

33:02.323 --> 33:04.686
And he had a dinner one night for...

33:05.594 --> 33:06.975
George, what was his name?

33:07.195 --> 33:11.339
The fellow who was married to Edward G. Robinson's ex, his former wife.

33:11.439 --> 33:13.121
He knew paintings.

33:13.141 --> 33:14.142
Paintings, very well.

33:14.322 --> 33:16.163
Edward knew paintings.

33:16.183 --> 33:16.904
Wonderful paintings.

33:16.924 --> 33:19.907
I had lunch with him at the Hillcrest.

33:19.947 --> 33:22.569
He was a member of the Hillcrest in California.

33:22.589 --> 33:23.030
Robinson.

33:23.090 --> 33:23.930
Robinson, yeah.

33:24.971 --> 33:29.015
He wasn't interested in books, but he was interested, and he had a great knowledge of painting.

33:29.035 --> 33:30.436
He was an intelligent man.

33:30.496 --> 33:30.837
Very intelligent.

33:30.857 --> 33:31.958
He was a sophisticated man.

33:32.298 --> 33:33.899
Very, very intelligent man.

33:33.959 --> 33:34.740
I had lunch with him.

33:34.923 --> 33:36.605
Unusual for the Hollywood types.

33:36.965 --> 33:38.446
That's right.

33:38.827 --> 33:39.187
Unusual.

33:39.207 --> 33:42.250
I'm trying to think of a guy on Broadway who wrote a wonderful book collection.

33:42.270 --> 33:47.996
They say he died, and he had so many books in his apartment, they couldn't get him out of the apartment.

33:48.877 --> 33:49.918
You know who I'm talking about?

33:50.158 --> 33:55.063
Geez, I can't think of his name right now.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.965
Remember they told you that story?

33:56.985 --> 33:57.886
I can't go to faith.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.369
Oh, the name is right on the tip of my tongue.

34:02.513 --> 34:04.915
It was all dramatic stuff.

34:05.036 --> 34:06.297
Lee Strasberg, maybe?

34:07.598 --> 34:07.658
No.

34:07.678 --> 34:08.459
Was he a collector?

34:10.601 --> 34:10.661
No.

34:10.681 --> 34:19.470
Well, anyway, I guess it's ... I guess, I think focus ... Let's talk about John Quinn a little bit, if you don't mind, because he's very important.

34:19.490 --> 34:20.431
Well, he was a lawyer.

34:21.032 --> 34:22.113
But he was a patron.

34:22.233 --> 34:23.274
He was a benefactor.

34:23.334 --> 34:25.737
And he was a patron of the arts.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.740
And he was a little bit on the crooked side.

34:29.463 --> 34:33.749
Well, let me modify this a little bit.

34:33.769 --> 34:37.594
You know, he would send Joyce some money, you know.

34:38.636 --> 34:40.058
Joyce would send him a manuscript.

34:40.118 --> 34:41.800
He sent him the manuscript of Ulysses.

34:42.021 --> 34:44.324
Right, which Rosenbach finally bought, as a matter of fact.

34:44.344 --> 34:45.065
Now, any paper?

34:45.465 --> 34:47.829
One thousand three something, yeah.

34:47.849 --> 34:49.051
You know what it would bring today?

34:49.071 --> 34:49.651
Two, three million.

34:49.912 --> 34:52.455
Four million.

34:52.495 --> 34:52.816
Am I right?

34:53.136 --> 34:53.477
Sure.

34:53.497 --> 34:55.099
If Kafka's metamorphosis

34:55.568 --> 34:59.493
can get $2 million, whatever it is, what would Ulysses get?

34:59.513 --> 35:04.238
$1,000 at public auction.

35:04.639 --> 35:06.842
And the president... Were you there?

35:07.422 --> 35:08.724
Well, of course I was there.

35:08.784 --> 35:09.765
Why didn't you bid on it?

35:09.905 --> 35:11.447
Why didn't I bid on it?

35:11.467 --> 35:13.870
If you hadn't got the money in your pocket, you don't bid.

35:14.331 --> 35:16.033
This was 1922-23, right around there.

35:16.113 --> 35:18.756
That's right.

35:19.196 --> 35:22.200
What did you think when it went down for that kind of money?

35:22.535 --> 35:23.436
What shall I think?

35:23.657 --> 35:28.103
You told me earlier that Joyce, you couldn't give Joyce books away.

35:28.123 --> 35:28.443
That's right.

35:28.463 --> 35:32.349
So you're going to spend a thousand dollars for something that people didn't read?

35:33.430 --> 35:48.331
The first book that Joyce was published in America was The Young Man, The Artist of the Young... Portrait of an Artist of the Young Man.

35:48.351 --> 35:49.453
1917.

35:51.037 --> 35:53.119
I knew the publisher very well, frankly.

35:53.139 --> 35:58.464
He was down at the university place on 12th Street, 13th Street.

35:58.484 --> 35:59.705
And I was around the corner.

35:59.765 --> 36:04.430
I was on 8th Street at that time.

36:04.750 --> 36:11.396
This was 1917, 16, 15, where I met Albert Boner.

36:11.416 --> 36:12.618
Boner Liberate Street.

36:12.778 --> 36:13.719
Oh, very famous.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.781
Albert was a very personal friend of mine.

36:16.401 --> 36:18.343
Knew him from up to the day he died.

36:19.758 --> 36:21.420
Albert and I were close friends.

36:21.901 --> 36:24.063
Used to come here every single day of his life.

36:25.765 --> 36:28.348
Now, was he a book collector, or just friendship?

36:28.529 --> 36:32.453
Well, we were friendship, but he was a great publisher.

36:32.473 --> 36:37.860
And he had this book shop there with his brother on H Street.

36:37.880 --> 36:41.524
And the other publisher was... They were very important publishing.

36:41.905 --> 36:42.325
It was funny.

36:42.345 --> 36:43.247
They were one of the best.

36:44.388 --> 36:46.450
They did some Faulkner stuff, I think.

36:46.471 --> 36:46.971
Sure.

36:48.173 --> 36:48.533
Sure.

36:48.985 --> 36:51.447
I'm sorry, anyway, I interrupted on that.

36:51.467 --> 36:54.009
But nobody wanted to buy these portraits of them.

36:54.029 --> 36:56.331
I mean, they couldn't sell the damn thing, I mean.

36:56.932 --> 36:59.714
He printed 700 copies, 800 copies.

37:00.975 --> 37:01.656
And he signed them.

37:02.457 --> 37:03.317
Yeah.

37:03.337 --> 37:07.161
Now you see them in catalogs for $30,000 and $40,000.

37:07.321 --> 37:07.941
That's a lot of money.

37:08.282 --> 37:08.602
Sure.

37:08.622 --> 37:09.523
Too much money for that.

37:09.843 --> 37:11.584
But you see, that's how it is.

37:12.545 --> 37:14.947
Yeah, but now you were at—but let's go back to the Quinn auction.

37:14.987 --> 37:15.628
Now, you were there.

37:16.088 --> 37:17.009
Yes.

37:17.029 --> 37:18.030
Would you have bought it?

37:18.449 --> 37:19.230
If you had the money?

37:19.370 --> 37:20.432
If I had the money.

37:21.333 --> 37:22.294
Were you interested in it?

37:22.895 --> 37:23.376
Of course I was.

37:23.416 --> 37:32.588
Was it on your checklist when you went there or something that you were going to... What do you... I mean... So you think that Dr. Rosenbach stole that after $1,000?

37:32.848 --> 37:34.751
Well, I don't know whether he stole it.

37:34.771 --> 37:36.633
I'm not suggesting anything criminal.

37:36.793 --> 37:37.454
No, no, no.

37:37.634 --> 37:39.177
I don't think he stole it.

37:39.277 --> 37:40.719
That was the price.

37:41.139 --> 37:46.686
On the other hand, he bought a document he paid for Buck and Gwinnett.

37:47.347 --> 37:47.848
He paid

37:48.065 --> 37:48.686
$52,000.

37:49.626 --> 37:51.228
Gabriel Wells was the underbidder.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.532
And he eventually sold it for some $5,000.

37:55.552 --> 37:57.114
That's something.

37:57.174 --> 37:58.295
Yeah, I don't know.

37:58.995 --> 38:00.697
Now, blacked up one more.

38:01.858 --> 38:01.958
Yeah.

38:01.978 --> 38:03.379
He sold it to Mrs. Doheny.

38:04.501 --> 38:05.341
Did you do anything?

38:05.642 --> 38:09.786
Now, those are the two great sales of the 80s, Doheny and Martin.

38:09.806 --> 38:10.666
Yeah.

38:10.726 --> 38:10.927
Very good.

38:10.947 --> 38:12.528
And there's Doheny in the red.

38:12.568 --> 38:15.591
Yeah, which we have at home.

38:16.702 --> 38:18.404
Did you have any dealings with her?

38:18.524 --> 38:18.764
Some.

38:19.024 --> 38:19.945
Not too much.

38:19.966 --> 38:21.147
Well, that's an interesting story.

38:21.427 --> 38:24.310
Wasn't she a farmer in a convent or something like that?

38:24.330 --> 38:25.251
Something like that.

38:25.331 --> 38:27.934
You know, her husband made all that money.

38:27.954 --> 38:32.139
He was in the teapot-dome business.

38:32.159 --> 38:33.840
Oh, is that right?

38:33.860 --> 38:34.441
That's a big standard.

38:34.461 --> 38:38.385
But then he indulged her love for acquiring things.

38:38.405 --> 38:39.086
Well, she bought.

38:39.106 --> 38:40.327
She bought like a drunken set.

38:40.468 --> 38:41.909
See, that was an accumulation.

38:41.949 --> 38:42.810
That wasn't a collection.

38:42.993 --> 38:44.014
Yeah, because there's no focus.

38:44.215 --> 38:44.836
No focus.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.178
We have to talk about focus.

38:46.378 --> 38:47.920
You get my point?

38:47.940 --> 38:48.180
Yes.

38:49.482 --> 38:54.129
And I think you could probably say that about the garden collection, which went down a couple weeks ago.

38:54.510 --> 38:55.331
That's right.

38:55.411 --> 38:56.472
There was a collection.

38:56.492 --> 38:57.233
It was high spots.

38:57.554 --> 38:58.355
High spots.

38:58.375 --> 38:58.655
Right.

38:59.837 --> 39:03.362
Well, Bradley had basically the material.

39:04.203 --> 39:04.584
Focus.

39:05.065 --> 39:05.485
Focus.

39:05.505 --> 39:06.347
He knew what he wanted.

39:06.727 --> 39:10.012
He knew what he wanted, and he knew what he had.

39:10.172 --> 39:10.873
And he knew what he had.

39:11.495 --> 39:13.017
Right now, you got the end.

39:13.657 --> 39:18.702
Going back to Greece, I spent some time in Greece, in the Greek islands.

39:21.585 --> 39:23.888
And I found it very, very interesting.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.712
The islands were interesting to me.

39:29.293 --> 39:38.683
And the place itself was... I was a little bit disappointed, though, when I went to see the...

39:40.840 --> 39:44.445
I'm sent a notebook.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.446
That's in Turkey, you mean?

39:45.466 --> 39:46.167
That's in Turkey.

39:47.809 --> 39:51.835
I was a boy, I read about the golden... Topkapi?

39:52.175 --> 39:54.779
The golden horn and the group up first.

39:56.181 --> 39:58.023
I came out there, I looked at it, Turkey!

39:58.283 --> 40:01.708
Everybody says that, unfortunately.

40:01.808 --> 40:04.552
Because it's Turkey now, it's not the Greeks that went there.

40:04.572 --> 40:07.776
You know, I was so disappointed, you know.

40:08.093 --> 40:08.874
Now, how about Israel?

40:09.134 --> 40:11.876
I imagine you've... Oh, I've been to Israel many times.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.638
The first time I went to Israel, 1955.

40:16.980 --> 40:21.404
I established two big libraries at the university there.

40:21.424 --> 40:22.405
I mean, I could stop, right?

40:23.726 --> 40:24.407
Where, in Israel?

40:24.647 --> 40:30.152
Yeah, at the Israeli university.

40:30.232 --> 40:33.014
And what are the names of the libraries?

40:33.154 --> 40:36.897
That's the main library, the University of Jerusalem.

40:36.917 --> 40:37.898
You established them?

40:38.300 --> 40:39.421
Two big libraries.

40:39.541 --> 40:40.443
Now how did you do this?

40:40.603 --> 40:46.910
Well, they came from New York collectors and brought over from Europe, you know what it means.

40:46.950 --> 40:54.659
The man died, and in order for the state to take a tax deduction, they had to be delivered here, not there.

40:55.380 --> 40:58.504
So the authors here accepted it, and they shifted over.

40:58.764 --> 40:59.325
My God.

41:02.188 --> 41:03.149
Well, now let's go.

41:03.390 --> 41:03.750
Okay.

41:05.890 --> 41:11.636
You have people actually calling and you're doing business?

41:12.197 --> 41:13.618
I'm doing business all the time.

41:14.179 --> 41:14.999
Mainly my wife.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.583
Passed away last year.

41:20.385 --> 41:23.408
How long were you married?

41:24.029 --> 41:24.990
67 years.

41:25.591 --> 41:28.153
And how many children?

41:28.353 --> 41:29.635
Two children.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.738
Six grandchildren.

41:33.198 --> 41:35.661
Sons, daughters, one of each?

41:36.687 --> 41:37.368
What are their names?

41:37.588 --> 41:38.629
I may as well get it on the record.

41:38.669 --> 41:43.274
Well, my daughter's name is Francis, and my son's name is Bernard.

41:43.294 --> 41:45.816
He lives in Sweden.

41:46.137 --> 41:46.397
Really?

41:46.897 --> 41:48.379
And he's the head of the university.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.401
In Sweden.

41:50.421 --> 41:53.084
He's here now, visiting.

41:53.104 --> 41:54.665
I had dinner with him last night.

41:54.685 --> 41:56.667
He's here visiting, and you're in the office today.

41:57.428 --> 41:59.530
Well, he's got things to do.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.192
He's got a life to lead, you know.

42:03.454 --> 42:04.395
You've got to keep active.

42:04.415 --> 42:05.316
That's what it comes down to.

42:05.336 --> 42:06.357
That's all I've got to keep active.

42:07.332 --> 42:10.596
Well, I hope your children have the longevity that you and your wife have had.

42:10.616 --> 42:12.018
Were you born in New York?

42:12.138 --> 42:13.760
Right here in Manhattan Island.

42:13.780 --> 42:14.060
Uh-huh.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.682
And your parents were from where?

42:15.982 --> 42:16.963
From Poland.

42:17.384 --> 42:17.704
Poland.

42:17.724 --> 42:18.726
And when did they come here?

42:18.746 --> 42:22.550
1980, 1992.

42:22.971 --> 42:25.213
And what did your father do?

42:25.233 --> 42:27.256
He was walking around.

42:27.997 --> 42:28.137
Uh-huh.

42:28.157 --> 42:30.179
Pretty impressive, you know.

42:30.199 --> 42:33.723
What does a father do when he comes over?

42:34.284 --> 42:36.006
The Greeks opened coffee shops.

42:37.505 --> 42:43.412
And the others opened fruit sands, you know.

42:43.812 --> 42:48.578
You must have some interesting stories about the old 4th Avenue bookstores and stuff.

42:48.598 --> 42:48.958
Oh, yeah, sure.

42:48.978 --> 42:51.141
Somebody just called me up the other day.

42:51.842 --> 42:53.884
See, I used to issue catalogs.

42:54.465 --> 42:57.608
But in the last 10 years, I haven't issued any catalogs.

42:57.628 --> 42:59.170
How many catalogs did you do?

42:59.751 --> 43:00.752
You must have numbered them.

43:01.012 --> 43:01.593
80 years.

43:02.274 --> 43:03.335
80 years?

43:03.555 --> 43:06.599
So you had in the hundreds.

43:06.879 --> 43:07.039
Sure.

43:08.588 --> 43:10.090
You must have a whole collection of them.

43:10.130 --> 43:11.331
Now, how about your stuff?

43:11.351 --> 43:12.352
Where's your stuff going?

43:13.153 --> 43:13.854
My stuff?

43:13.994 --> 43:15.155
I have no stuff.

43:15.376 --> 43:16.357
I'm giving everything away.

43:16.457 --> 43:17.758
Well, I mean, that's where you are.

43:17.778 --> 43:22.644
You look around, and it's a very... I have things like that all over the damn place.

43:22.664 --> 43:23.705
I throw everything away.

43:24.025 --> 43:28.230
But it's a very spare... Let's go have some lunch.

43:28.530 --> 43:28.851
You see?

43:33.336 --> 43:35.979
Oh, I've got that book, yeah.

43:36.019 --> 43:37.060
It's a very interesting book.

43:37.411 --> 43:40.236
Oh, you see, did he get this from you, this manuscript?

43:40.316 --> 43:41.578
I know the history of this book.

43:42.619 --> 43:45.885
To Dave Kirschenbaum, who made, I would know this book.

43:46.385 --> 43:49.771
We have this book, who made this whole project crossable.

43:49.871 --> 43:50.191
Thanks.

43:51.073 --> 43:53.076
This is on the Nagel Journal.

43:53.216 --> 43:56.101
He tells how he got this.

43:56.121 --> 43:58.104
He couldn't believe his good fortune.

43:58.404 --> 43:59.606
I bought it.

43:59.626 --> 44:00.448
I bought it.

44:01.830 --> 44:04.414
In here, he tells you the whole story about me.

44:05.660 --> 44:07.282
I'm going to call him, you know.

44:08.343 --> 44:09.044
Go ahead.

44:09.384 --> 44:11.326
As a matter of fact, I was going to call John.

44:11.346 --> 44:13.308
I thought it was on the floor.

44:13.929 --> 44:15.070
I was going to call John.

44:15.991 --> 44:17.012
He just sent me that.

44:17.032 --> 44:17.753
Isn't that nice?

44:19.434 --> 44:22.277
Eagle Journal, you say, came up in a little auction here in New York.

44:22.418 --> 44:23.819
And he called me on the phone.

44:23.879 --> 44:28.444
He read the description and he said, David, go over and take it.

44:28.544 --> 44:29.605
John called me.

44:29.625 --> 44:33.549
He said, go over and take a look at it and see what you think of it.

44:33.569 --> 44:35.211
So I went over and I looked at it.

44:35.697 --> 44:37.359
And I found it very intriguing.

44:37.419 --> 44:51.212
He was a young man, young boy, I think he was 17, went into with Washington's army in Valley Forge, and the whole thing, and then into the Navy, you know.

44:51.252 --> 44:53.774
Then he was in the War of 1812, and he was at sea.

44:54.115 --> 44:54.475
Yes.

44:54.895 --> 44:55.956
It's all in this journal.

44:55.976 --> 44:56.797
It's all in this journal.

44:56.817 --> 44:58.999
And then he was taken prisoner by the British.

44:59.260 --> 45:02.383
So I called John on the phone.

45:02.403 --> 45:04.945
I said, John, I found it very intriguing.

45:05.532 --> 45:06.713
He said, well, go ahead and buy.

45:06.733 --> 45:10.057
So I think I paid $1,100 for it.

45:10.077 --> 45:10.638
I read that.

45:10.778 --> 45:11.639
I couldn't believe it.

45:13.541 --> 45:15.783
That there are still great buys available.

45:15.803 --> 45:15.903
Sure.

45:15.943 --> 45:16.985
This was just recent.

45:17.085 --> 45:19.868
I mean, we don't have to pay a million dollars to get something nice.

45:19.888 --> 45:20.769
Isn't that what they're trying?

45:21.690 --> 45:22.470
That's your answer.

45:25.053 --> 45:25.754
$6 a piece.

45:25.774 --> 45:26.175
$4 a piece.

45:26.695 --> 45:30.259
Today they bring $2,000, $3,000.

45:30.379 --> 45:31.600
A piece?

45:31.620 --> 45:32.141
Yeah.

45:32.281 --> 45:34.063
And this was 500 documents.

45:34.363 --> 45:34.864
That's right.

45:35.384 --> 45:43.334
How soon after the war would you say that would have been?

45:43.354 --> 45:47.499
That was, of course, many years after the war.

45:47.519 --> 45:51.844
You know, Hitler, the modernist, he signed a couple of Meisters, you know, a couple of them.

45:51.864 --> 45:52.345
That's right.

45:52.545 --> 45:55.288
So these documents actually went back to the prefure.

45:55.328 --> 45:56.249
That's right.

46:00.074 --> 46:00.675
Preserving.

46:01.195 --> 46:03.518
You say that's the important thing to think of.

46:06.991 --> 46:31.682
is that i wonder if you could just elaborate on that a little bit she hasn't missed a word you say that you helped the historical society get some stuff for their their collection

46:34.480 --> 46:36.666
You said you've known them for 60 years over there.

46:36.766 --> 46:37.307
Oh, yeah.

46:38.209 --> 46:38.630
Thanks.

46:41.197 --> 46:46.009
