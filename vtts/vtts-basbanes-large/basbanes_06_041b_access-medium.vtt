00:02.630 --> 00:07.834
Yes, but I mean, people do.

00:08.295 --> 00:32.535
I think that one day people will look back on structuralism and reception theory and intentionality and all these other critical shibboleths that have been invented over the last

00:33.190 --> 00:35.754
over 30, 40 years.

00:35.834 --> 00:45.026
And really, rather like modern art, you can think of the imprisoning change.

00:45.046 --> 00:45.788
I don't know how.

00:46.088 --> 00:56.502
When we talk about the guidance sale, and that sale realized $16 million, which is big money for books.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.445
However, not much.

00:58.806 --> 01:00.548
However, the night

01:01.135 --> 01:06.203
Before, no, this was a, was it a four-session sale or a two-session sale?

01:06.223 --> 01:09.167
I forget, but I was there for all of them.

01:09.187 --> 01:16.197
The night before this thing opened, it was a two-session sale, a Japanese paid $22 million for a de Kooning.

01:16.378 --> 01:17.059
Yes, exactly.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.883
Which was a living artist, not active.

01:20.063 --> 01:23.328
Yes, but as you see, I mean, it's quite relevant.

01:23.889 --> 01:30.619
Yes, well, pictures and books have always lived into entirely different leagues and always have done.

01:31.207 --> 01:55.770
But I mean, in real terms, I mean, a far greater collection than the garden collection, obviously, is the Bradley Martin collection, you see, which is collected over a longer period of time by a man with a good deal more real feeling from the knowledge of the taste of everything, you know.

01:55.790 --> 02:00.775
And, you know, I...

02:01.312 --> 02:05.338
I can't help you writing this book.

02:06.359 --> 02:10.245
I can't help the feeling of all the other collections.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.028
Bradley Brighton is in my book.

02:12.068 --> 02:17.476
Yes, I'm sure he is, but no, I mean, you're not shutting up already, are you?

02:18.437 --> 02:21.722
There is a note, it's half past eight, and it's by the time I stopped and looked at it.

02:21.922 --> 02:24.606
Have they closed up the North London?

02:24.626 --> 02:24.946
Not yet.

02:24.966 --> 02:27.510
No, I'll go and have a look at the notes.

02:27.530 --> 02:28.331
I must escort you off.

02:28.592 --> 02:30.154
But no, I keep on thinking.

02:30.455 --> 02:57.205
as well of the uh of all the collectors in the past going back to the dot well can you name me a couple as we walk out that what i would like well i mean i mean i mean i mean we have crotton and power we have grenville we have heber we have uh you know ptolemy ptolemy in egypt putting together the alexandrian library i start with that but every i mean it's like

02:57.337 --> 03:02.165
I even have Pergamum in there as well.

03:03.949 --> 03:04.770
I can't do it all.

03:04.790 --> 03:21.960
No, but the whole, I mean, what I think one should give input, one should certainly say that this is a coral reef business, a new collection.

03:22.328 --> 03:47.408
no creation is ever more than a step in a gradually ascending edifice and all the bits that you've been thinking about and looking at are another layer of the reef.

03:47.607 --> 04:03.382
Can you tell me what you feel about this room as we walk in?

04:03.402 --> 04:08.346
Here we are walking along the floor.

04:08.366 --> 04:10.488
The floor inside here rises.

04:10.508 --> 04:14.492
You reach a level here where you are two steps up.

04:17.932 --> 04:38.123
It grieves you to think that the library is abandoning us, and I hate to use that word, but I... Well, it's not the library that's abandoning us.

04:38.143 --> 04:39.906
The government that's moving the library.

04:46.990 --> 04:50.571
Well, I think that you...
