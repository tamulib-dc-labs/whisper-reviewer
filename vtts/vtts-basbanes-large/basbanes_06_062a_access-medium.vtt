WEBVTT

00:04.655 --> 00:07.882
I think she might have knocked it.

00:07.922 --> 00:11.571
Yeah, I think she did knock it, didn't she?

00:11.591 --> 00:14.958
Yeah, I think she knocked it.

00:15.299 --> 00:20.250
Well, okay, to get play, in Huns Krauss,

00:20.433 --> 00:39.610
Ernst Krause, you know, the greatest American bookseller since Rosenbach, bought from Arthur Holden Corning Glass, one of the great American collectors, his copy of the Gutenberg Bible in the 1970s for around a million dollars.

00:39.630 --> 00:44.574
And you were written in the... No, I wasn't with Lou, but this is knowledge in the trade, you see.

00:44.734 --> 00:48.718
At that time, I was at the first 70s, actually.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.901
took an option on it.

00:50.961 --> 00:53.024
The book was priced $2 million.

00:53.044 --> 01:08.546
Lou took an option, a goodwill deposit, put down a goodwill deposit in the sense that if he couldn't sell the book for the year, he could tell us, he would owe Krauss $200,000 for tying up the book for the year.

01:08.567 --> 01:11.070
Harry thought he could raise the money, Harry had some of the taxes.

01:11.391 --> 01:17.980
To make the whole story short, in 72, no matter how he couldn't raise the money,

01:18.230 --> 01:22.255
Harry was, you know, moved upstairs and kind of had their palace crew.

01:23.436 --> 01:27.981
And Lou paid Hans Krauss the $200,000.

01:28.341 --> 01:29.823
He must have killed him.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.085
Probably killed him.

01:31.165 --> 01:36.771
Well, in around 75, Lou was quite ill at those days, and I was there.

01:36.951 --> 01:39.494
There wasn't much going on, really.

01:39.514 --> 01:42.958
We were selling a lot of detective material in Sherlock Holmes.

01:43.739 --> 01:45.621
Lou one day said,

01:45.922 --> 01:55.988
to his secretary, May Arkin, to see if there's anything in the file about Texas owing me money for the lapse option.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.998
And there wasn't really anything.

02:00.333 --> 02:03.237
No, no, no, no legal documents.

02:03.277 --> 02:07.883
There might have been a letter, not only a legal letter of intent.

02:07.943 --> 02:12.208
There might have been something that Lou would dictate to his secretary after talking to Ransom.

02:12.228 --> 02:18.096
Talked to Harry Ransom, we agreed X, Y, Z, you know, but that's not a legally binding document.

02:18.116 --> 02:23.663
There wasn't anything, and I said, Lou, we've got a lot of stock, a lot of things Texas would want.

02:23.703 --> 02:29.631
Why don't you suggest that they buy $200,000 worth of material at retail from New England here?

02:30.421 --> 02:33.928
He thought that was mad at this point.

02:34.368 --> 02:34.909
He still doesn't.

02:34.930 --> 02:47.633
He called Warren Roberts, and at that time we had a Beckett, Samuel Beckett collection, that Texas had fabulous Beckett manuscripts that didn't have any first editions.

02:47.654 --> 02:53.745
So we sent him the Beckett collection, they picked out, Warren Roberts came up, picked out the Beckett collection,

02:54.670 --> 02:58.858
I think that might have been 75,000, 65,000.

02:59.018 --> 03:07.053
We had had in stock all of George Eliot's corrected proof copies of her novels, of her books.

03:07.093 --> 03:09.037
That was around 77,000.

03:09.057 --> 03:14.046
And then, Warren Roberts picked out from the vast hoard of Siegfried South Sioux material,

03:15.359 --> 03:19.086
$50,000 or whatever it is to make up the difference of $200,000.

03:19.106 --> 03:24.415
That all went to Texas, and that's how, and then Texas did credit check, say, for $200,000.

03:24.475 --> 03:27.560
Yeah, but we built, we invoiced them for these purchases.

03:27.580 --> 03:36.456
You see, what they did, rather than paying Goldman $200,000 just cold cash for nothing, for this last option, it was a compromise.

03:36.436 --> 03:44.234
They said, okay, you know, we haven't been spending much money, but we'll buy $200,000 from the inventory.

03:44.355 --> 03:46.780
So they came up and they selected this material.

03:46.801 --> 03:49.146
In fact, it's Sue, George Eliot.

03:49.767 --> 04:00.464
You can't add a zero, but you can multiply it by five, certainly.

04:00.484 --> 04:02.167
You know what I mean?

04:02.267 --> 04:06.273
It's a million dollars worth of stuff.

04:06.373 --> 04:11.381
So they used up, they bought $200,000 worth of retail.

04:11.442 --> 04:13.024
This was your idea.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.505
It was my idea.

04:14.846 --> 04:18.870
I mean, I have no documentation, but I'd sit around with Lou in these afternoons.

04:18.890 --> 04:20.291
He died.

04:20.631 --> 04:22.233
I think he was 70 when he died.

04:22.253 --> 04:25.917
He had some leg problems, all kinds of problems.

04:25.937 --> 04:27.578
And he would lie in bed.

04:28.179 --> 04:32.103
Usually, if it was an afternoon Yankee game on, he had the Yankee game on.

04:32.123 --> 04:38.809
And he would sit there, and he would just kind of talk, snooze, that nobody else to talk to him.

04:39.177 --> 04:44.731
And one day I'll remember him saying, it's like we're on a log.

04:44.811 --> 04:47.919
I'm at one end and you're on the other because I'd sit at the foot of the dead.

04:49.182 --> 04:54.014
I one time asked him, you know, he told me stories about his early days.

04:54.034 --> 04:55.718
He got married at 19.

04:57.183 --> 05:03.177
He came from a Jewish family in Brownsburg, and I think he lived in Hoboken for a while.

05:03.618 --> 05:05.081
I said, Lou, why'd you get married in 19?

05:05.482 --> 05:08.789
He says, I thought sex was going to go out of style.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.772
You see?

05:09.872 --> 05:13.099
He was an earthy person.

05:13.484 --> 05:14.525
But he was honest.

05:15.086 --> 05:18.531
He was sharp.

05:18.852 --> 05:30.308
But he felt, having worked his way up the hard way, he wanted to take on the trappings of respectability and honesty.

05:30.368 --> 05:33.012
He could be arrogant.

05:32.992 --> 05:34.980
He could be totally uncharming.

05:35.261 --> 05:43.795
People loathed him, particularly the more traditional booksellers who saw him as an arch-team, as an arch-team.

05:44.348 --> 05:47.593
You say, hey, because here's this Texas thing, they're upsetting the market.

05:48.074 --> 05:56.268
Of course, you look back from today's standard, it looks like kids playing in a sandbox compared to the prices and what's going on today.

05:56.328 --> 05:59.313
Just don't have a chance that we missed that quote, and we're running now.

05:59.594 --> 06:03.420
Give me the gold and get straight once more.

06:04.042 --> 06:16.315
One time I asked Lou, there was a great collector named Jonathan Gideon, of modern literature, like an old line.

06:16.916 --> 06:20.980
His library was dispersed at Sotheby's in 76, 78.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.362
I cataloged it there.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.045
Hemingway, expatriate writers, fabulous.

06:25.825 --> 06:29.890
And what we were talking about him one day was at Thelma's.

06:29.970 --> 06:32.833
The afternoons that we just sat around and talked.

06:33.573 --> 06:35.796
I said, whatever happened to Jonathan Griffin?

06:35.816 --> 06:40.661
He said, oh, God, in those years, I had the golden goose.

06:40.801 --> 06:44.185
I couldn't pay attention to these chickens.

06:45.246 --> 06:47.269
He said he was one of the great collectors here in Canada.

06:47.309 --> 06:48.430
He said, I didn't have the time.

06:48.770 --> 06:55.598
The offices, I called my office the world's most expensive warehouse because the stuff would come in in plates.

06:55.949 --> 07:05.004
from auctions, from authors, from archives from Europe, and they'd be processed, and the customs drive would come, the men would go down to Texas.

07:05.424 --> 07:09.771
Was he buying with discrimination, do you think, or was he buying in one direction?

07:09.791 --> 07:11.494
No, he was buying...

07:12.689 --> 07:19.456
I mean, some things you say, well, I wonder why that's down there.

07:19.476 --> 07:25.242
They have the money to spend, and, you know, I mean, I always used to say, Harry's holding the vacuum.

07:25.302 --> 07:30.147
Harry has the vacuum cleaner plugged in, and Lou's holding the vacuum cleaner.

07:30.748 --> 07:32.569
The stuff's around, they have the money to spend.

07:32.629 --> 07:33.711
Yes, you're going to be buying.

07:33.731 --> 07:37.715
Sometimes it will have to spend much.

07:37.735 --> 07:38.936
But they would drop stuff.

07:38.976 --> 07:40.958
There were some things that wouldn't go near.

07:41.883 --> 07:47.505
There's a lot of minor writers that might have ended up.

07:48.008 --> 07:48.569
No, I'm fine.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.472
There's a lot of minor writers might have done it up.

07:51.492 --> 07:54.195
In hindsight, they don't look important.

07:54.215 --> 07:56.317
But this is minor, and it wasn't expensive.

07:56.337 --> 07:57.979
You know, look back on the stuff.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.701
It wasn't expensive.

07:59.901 --> 08:06.749
You're familiar with Charles Tennyson's book, Action 1, which was 81.

08:06.769 --> 08:11.754
He makes this extraordinary allegation that both men were dead at the time.

08:11.855 --> 08:14.117
Both men were dead.

08:14.097 --> 08:19.413
I should have brought a copy of it with me, but it's certainly one of the most inflammatory things.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.777
Well, it's scandalous, I think.

08:20.797 --> 08:23.224
Well, it's libelous if they were alive.

08:23.244 --> 08:25.390
Detective Turner, when he was...

08:25.724 --> 08:26.825
head of HRC.

08:26.945 --> 08:32.532
I always thought it's Humanities Research Center and Harry Ransom Center, you know, and it's the same monograph.

08:32.632 --> 08:38.459
And it said that Harry Ransom named at HRC the ultimate redesignation.

08:38.479 --> 08:48.711
And I was going to say yes, and I think Decker Turner and Thelman's sons, Joel

08:48.691 --> 08:49.652
and Arnold.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.735
Coleman had two sons.

08:51.956 --> 08:52.957
Joel's passed away.

08:52.977 --> 08:55.521
Arnold is retired, I guess, at this point.

08:55.541 --> 08:58.385
He was in the Garment Center.

08:58.606 --> 09:04.414
Whether they still have the LDF files, I don't know.

09:04.534 --> 09:07.839
They're very paranoid, particularly after that book came out.

09:07.859 --> 09:09.822
They just don't want anybody to poke around.

09:09.802 --> 09:12.024
I always said you should send it down to Texas.

09:12.044 --> 09:15.027
It belongs to Texas, and nothing's ever come of that.

09:16.068 --> 09:18.810
Are these guys around, the Feldman boys?

09:19.010 --> 09:19.711
Arnold's around.

09:19.771 --> 09:21.252
I can give you his number if you want.

09:21.372 --> 09:22.573
I mean, I have it at home.

09:22.593 --> 09:31.401
You could say you're writing a book, and you could always preface it by you wanting to get the other side of the story from that horrible Hamilton book.

09:31.421 --> 09:35.084
Well, let me put this on the record while we're talking.

09:35.264 --> 09:37.927
I confronted Hamilton on the phone.

09:38.007 --> 09:39.268
We did a telephone interview.

09:39.248 --> 09:44.659
It's almost like he had been waiting nine years for this question to be asked.

09:44.679 --> 09:46.262
And I said, where did you go?

09:46.302 --> 09:47.705
Do you have anything to back this up?

09:47.725 --> 09:55.261
I mean, you make a flat statement that they made millions together, bilking, and these are the verbs that he used.

09:55.321 --> 09:58.287
The University of Texas buying worthless materials.

09:58.537 --> 10:01.462
I mean, so it's one word after another.

10:01.482 --> 10:03.044
And I say, can you give me one example?

10:03.205 --> 10:11.258
Give me one example of worthless material that they bought, how much they paid for it, and how you know that they came to make millions.

10:11.278 --> 10:17.929
I mean, these are pretty straightforward questions, but if you make allegations like that, you should be prepared to defend.

10:18.145 --> 10:21.729
And he said, well, I can't give you any specifics on this.

10:21.809 --> 10:23.612
I'll play the tape for you.

10:23.792 --> 10:28.517
I mean, if you were a witness man, I mean, you'd blow him out of the water.

10:28.537 --> 10:29.719
Well, the book was a horrible book.

10:29.739 --> 10:33.023
It was interesting at some points, but he was also insulting the other auction house.

10:33.343 --> 10:34.344
But that was scandalous.

10:34.364 --> 10:35.986
He got that information.

10:36.006 --> 10:37.108
Let me just tell you what he told me.

10:37.128 --> 10:38.009
Let me tell you what he told me.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.090
What he told me is,

10:39.070 --> 10:45.422
Yet, he was very friendly with a former secretary of 812, and she wouldn't name her.

10:45.683 --> 10:47.446
And she told him this.

10:47.566 --> 10:50.251
And I said, what is this woman's name?

10:50.271 --> 10:51.193
And he wouldn't tell me.

10:51.293 --> 10:53.237
I said, well, do you think she'll talk to me?

10:53.257 --> 10:54.319
They said, I'd have to ask.

10:54.339 --> 10:54.900
I'd have to check.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.465
But I don't think socials become very efficient.

10:57.485 --> 10:59.509
I said, but she didn't give you any specifics.

10:59.489 --> 11:01.372
And he said, none that I can give you.

11:01.472 --> 11:03.695
I mean, in other words, he bailed out of it.

11:03.855 --> 11:04.817
He bailed out of it.

11:05.057 --> 11:08.001
And I think I can blow this thing out of the water.

11:08.081 --> 11:10.404
Well, I think you can.

11:10.665 --> 11:20.138
And what it is, the woman's name is Miss Regina, R-E-G-I-N-A Reynolds, R-E-Y-N-O-L-D-S.

11:20.278 --> 11:28.450
And she lived at the Barbizon Hotel, which used to be the Barbizon Hotel for women.

11:29.594 --> 11:33.620
Doleman's co-ops, he had kind of a half a floor co-ops.

11:34.101 --> 11:41.312
On 63rd Street in Lexington, right across the street, this is Barber's Art.

11:41.632 --> 11:50.886
When I went there in January of 73, Lou had just come out of the hospital, there was some medical problem, and he had a male nurse.

11:52.028 --> 11:56.715
And Regina was always in the hunt for sugar daddy.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.557
She would dial herself up.

11:58.577 --> 11:59.720
How old was she?

12:00.602 --> 12:07.316
At that time, she must have been... She must have been 50-ish.

12:07.737 --> 12:11.325
Late 40s, 50-ish.

12:11.425 --> 12:15.835
45-ish would be... It was hard to tell, because she'd really...

12:15.815 --> 12:27.037
She's a nice looking woman and very feminine in terms of the 50 movies and how she thought men would appreciate femininity.

12:27.197 --> 12:29.040
Oh, man, let me do that for you.

12:29.061 --> 12:31.666
You know, I mean, now the women will just blow her out.

12:31.686 --> 12:32.708
You can't do that anymore.

12:32.728 --> 12:33.730
They don't like talking.

12:33.790 --> 12:37.637
I mean, she makes Barbara Bush like a shaming radical.

12:37.617 --> 12:42.847
And she got in there and she was like kind of a companion.

12:43.628 --> 12:44.530
Not a nurse.

12:45.612 --> 12:47.315
Help her.

12:47.335 --> 12:48.618
She traveled with Lou.

12:48.998 --> 12:51.764
I don't think there was any hanky-panky at all.

12:51.844 --> 12:52.745
I don't think so.

12:52.766 --> 12:53.567
I don't know.

12:53.868 --> 12:56.392
They would always upset what they told them.

12:56.412 --> 12:59.957
New dependent upon his wife, Sally, who he married at 19.

13:00.137 --> 13:03.783
Yeah, it was kind of a single one of them.

13:03.803 --> 13:08.750
Sally sheared them from reality and made them the great new to go to auctions and buy all this stuff.

13:08.850 --> 13:17.243
And Regina got rid of them all first, and she was there every day, walking across the street.

13:17.392 --> 13:24.584
Helping to take care of Lou, go out to lunch with him, travel with him, answer phone calls at night for him.

13:25.325 --> 13:27.569
Lou was used to being late at that.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.494
And she hung in and hung in.

13:30.534 --> 13:33.018
I thought maybe she thought Lou might marry her.

13:33.278 --> 13:38.928
I think the most she ever got out of it was her first store from Lou's first wife got the store in the closet.

13:39.048 --> 13:40.851
How long would you say she was living?

13:40.831 --> 13:45.999
January 73 until his death in October 76.

13:46.079 --> 13:49.804
I left in July 76.

13:49.824 --> 13:54.351
Lou died in October 76.

13:54.691 --> 13:57.035
Three and a half years.

13:58.377 --> 14:00.500
So maybe she thought that she was in for something.

14:00.520 --> 14:06.028
She thought she was in for something in the world, or perhaps not.

14:06.008 --> 14:15.082
This is from her now, but when Lou was in the hospital a couple weeks before, he had, I forget the exact disease he had.

14:15.102 --> 14:16.844
He had all kinds of nervous diseases.

14:16.864 --> 14:18.547
I heard he had Lou Gehrig's disease.

14:18.687 --> 14:19.689
It could have been that.

14:19.709 --> 14:20.530
I think it was that.

14:20.550 --> 14:22.393
In fact, that's what it was.

14:22.473 --> 14:23.294
It's a horrible disease.

14:23.314 --> 14:24.916
It's a waste of time.

14:24.936 --> 14:29.383
A couple times out of, you know, helped Lou out of a bathtub, things like that.

14:29.853 --> 14:39.223
Anyway, I had heard from her after Lou died that she, Lou had promised her that he's going to marry her.

14:39.303 --> 14:43.207
You see, well, you've got to be careful with Lou's promises.

14:43.247 --> 14:45.690
He was honest, but it's because he promised that.

14:45.930 --> 14:50.535
But his sons found out about her, maybe Dad might marry this woman.

14:50.635 --> 14:53.899
He might die, but she gets the widow's share of the estate.

14:54.039 --> 14:59.725
And they had the locks changed on the apartment so she couldn't get in there.

15:00.160 --> 15:15.204
After he died around the house, two weeks before he died, a couple of weeks before he died, they kind of kicked her out, changed the locks in the apartment, got some practical nurse to take care of her father, and she couldn't get back in there.

15:15.224 --> 15:18.388
She said she's pissed.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.771
She's pissed.

15:19.791 --> 15:27.062
So after Lou died and was buried, she calls me, she had some schemes because she hated the two sons.

15:27.042 --> 15:38.588
She had some scheme of kind of putting in for calimony.

15:38.708 --> 15:42.196
Essentially you get a blackmail.

15:42.276 --> 15:45.102
If I don't get something, something is staged.

15:45.082 --> 15:58.605
We might squeal to the IRS that tax irregularities, that the value of the estate, the value of the inventory, was appraised too low, like she knew, like she would know.

15:58.645 --> 16:00.869
But she's quite capable.

16:00.889 --> 16:04.936
She might have talked to Lou and said, you know, what's the business word, Lou, and stuff like that.

16:04.956 --> 16:06.819
She might have had a little bit of information.

16:06.839 --> 16:08.322
She had no documentation.

16:08.977 --> 16:30.917
in fact one day very nicely she calls me and says come down to this lawyer with me and i'm down to this lawyer you know she's going to try to get something from the boys and i realized my god she's trying to get info from me to use the kind of blackmail the two cents i don't think the lawyer proceeded with it he saw this kind of dirty yeah but i got out of it but

16:30.897 --> 16:34.162
Charles Hamilton lived on 63rd Street.

16:34.182 --> 16:37.868
So this makes sense to you when I told you that there's a... Oh, this is the person.

16:38.148 --> 16:42.575
See, Hamilton lived on 63rd, like 63rd and 3rd.

16:43.136 --> 16:48.264
Regina Runners lived in the Barbizon Hotel for women at 63rd and next.

16:48.344 --> 16:50.247
Feldman was at 63rd and next.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.910
So Hamilton was a neighbor.

16:51.890 --> 16:55.698
And Regina was always going to different coffee shops and everything.

16:55.718 --> 16:56.861
She met Hamilton.

16:56.881 --> 16:58.384
Might have talked to her.

16:58.465 --> 17:00.128
Might have even gone up for drinks or something.

17:00.168 --> 17:05.340
And afterwards, she might have said, you know, boy, I'll tell you stuff that happened there.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.705
Hamilton, who's

17:08.191 --> 17:17.223
and figured, yeah, well, you can't invite somebody for slandering a dead person.

17:17.284 --> 17:19.807
He claims, he said that he never writes about people who are living.

17:19.827 --> 17:22.911
Well, that's kind of cowardly, because he has no documentation.

17:22.931 --> 17:29.961
Only hearsay evidence from a disenchanted ex-companion or somebody.

17:30.201 --> 17:33.446
Someone who, without question, had an axe to grab.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.008
Yeah, had an axe to grab.

17:34.988 --> 17:38.235
That's where Hamilton gets all the information.

17:38.596 --> 17:40.460
I should be able to locate her, wouldn't you think?

17:40.480 --> 17:42.103
Do you think she's got a phone number?

17:43.146 --> 17:43.947
You could try.

17:43.968 --> 17:47.936
Don't mention my name, though, because she might not.

17:48.157 --> 17:50.482
I'll tell you what I would say to her.

17:50.562 --> 17:52.506
I mean, I'm very scared.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.330
Yeah, I did an interview with Charles Hamilton.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.612
Also, she's known in the trade.

17:56.692 --> 18:01.057
Every time you go to London, I did an interview with Charles Hamilton.

18:01.117 --> 18:02.759
He identified you as the source.

18:03.199 --> 18:04.540
He didn't say this to me last night.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.002
He identified you as the source.

18:06.222 --> 18:12.689
He didn't identify you by name, but I thought, you know, you were... I could handle it.

18:12.809 --> 18:19.155
As soon as you told me that story, as soon as Hamilton revealed the source, I said, oh, that's Regina.

18:19.175 --> 18:20.757
The only other woman there...

18:20.737 --> 18:33.773
The only other employee at that time, other than me, was a very sweet secretary bookkeeper called May Harkin, who is a Jewish grandmother.

18:33.793 --> 18:41.362
I mean, there would be no... She wouldn't tell you it was raining outside, you know.

18:41.402 --> 18:45.186
She would not have been the source.

18:45.226 --> 18:47.810
She didn't know too much about the business.

18:47.830 --> 18:50.693
So it's Regina Reynolds, and this is the background of God.

18:50.673 --> 19:00.529
Just give me a general assessment.

19:00.609 --> 19:09.103
Is he a good bookman?

19:09.083 --> 19:15.231
I suspect someplace that he really wanted to be recognized as the Rosenbach of his life.

19:15.271 --> 19:18.596
He wanted to be recognized as the Rosenbach of his life.

19:18.616 --> 19:33.235
Dougher, he was extremely knowledgeable in the detective literature area, and I would say he was extremely knowledgeable in 19th and 20th century literature.

19:33.215 --> 19:37.165
Any more knowledge of it in some of the dealers today?

19:37.225 --> 19:38.829
Not necessarily in pure knowledge.

19:38.849 --> 19:40.733
He was very good as a businessman.

19:40.793 --> 19:46.026
Before he caught on with Ransom, he was just a normal book dealer.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.970
The Ransom thing kind of made, gave him the statue.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.172
He was buying for taxes.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.275
What do you think Harry Ransom's shop?

19:55.355 --> 19:58.758
I mean, there are hints of Harry Ransom.

19:58.778 --> 20:04.024
You just have to go to Texas just to realize that Jewish people aren't the most popular.

20:04.044 --> 20:04.144
Yeah.

20:04.284 --> 20:08.509
And people were amazed that his main man in the world would be a Jewish guy.

20:08.569 --> 20:14.275
Well, one of the English dealers who tried to cut in that business was

20:14.255 --> 20:16.893
Not a wine crowd.

20:16.993 --> 20:20.738
An English bookseller.

20:21.173 --> 20:49.830
wine shop is not the right word the voter would know i think uh maybe an architectural bill i don't know they said they shared this passion they shared this incredible passion of getting this material building up the line down in texas they say they call it harry wrestling's vision yeah and they shared it that they have but they shared lou would talk about this too and lou would say oh one day harry wanted to value the dora family castle in switzerland i said harry you really want that he said yes

20:49.810 --> 20:53.109
So when the master spoke, I moved.

20:54.015 --> 20:55.483
Apparently his letters

20:55.784 --> 20:58.569
I've seen a few letters in the North of Texas.

20:59.611 --> 21:00.773
Very poppice level.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.536
It's the editorial we, I mean.

21:02.556 --> 21:04.679
The real we, poppice.

21:04.699 --> 21:10.629
You see, coming up, we never went to college, but we think that he was going to be a rabbi.

21:10.850 --> 21:16.720
So he's putting on all these general traffic.

21:16.740 --> 21:21.488
You know, there's an American original story there is what I mean, you know.

21:21.468 --> 21:23.651
They say Lower East Side.

21:24.533 --> 21:31.303
Lower East Side drew as a kid, marries young, likes books.

21:31.323 --> 21:46.446
He was a manager in the 30s of some foreman and some factory they made hairbrushes, you know, and picks himself up and gets these trampings of silk socks and hamburgs and staying at the Westbury and cars meeting and like,

21:46.426 --> 21:56.016
at the airport, and his wife, for a while in the 50s, he lived in, he could make estates, and he would advertise, my wife Sally does an IC-ish tea.

21:57.478 --> 21:58.278
You see?

21:58.819 --> 22:02.363
Well, that ties in with the commodity, I've heard Cahoon.

22:02.943 --> 22:06.147
Now, Lou, you have the commodity to go with the commodity.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.568
He didn't think it would be pronounced that way.

22:07.588 --> 22:08.850
He thought it was the wrong way.

22:08.870 --> 22:12.113
Well, you see, Renovan says,

22:12.498 --> 22:14.682
Well, yes, yeah.

22:14.702 --> 22:19.149
The borders on anti-Semitism.

22:19.289 --> 22:29.667
It borders on anti-Semitism, but then the ghost of New could say, well, Wilhampton, you went bankrupt, I did.

22:29.787 --> 22:35.637
You see, I mean, he was the squadron forced out of the auction business.

22:35.617 --> 22:39.801
Hamilton, as a knowledgeable person about autographs, I think he's nuts.

22:39.881 --> 22:47.429
Hamilton as a businessman, even then, you know, I hear from very good people that, I mean, he's a hip shooter.

22:47.489 --> 22:48.750
Well, yeah, he shoots in the hip.

22:48.810 --> 22:51.332
Well, so does Ken and Doug, too.

22:51.473 --> 22:52.133
Sorry, Ken.

22:52.213 --> 22:53.234
Ken's my sister.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.898
Well, you've got to balance one against another.

22:56.938 --> 23:01.342
I mean, Ken got in pretty deep in the Hitler Diaries before he got out of it, you know what I mean?

23:01.362 --> 23:02.063
Hamilton said,

23:02.532 --> 23:08.239
It's inconceivable that Hitler could have spent this time writing his letters and so where the man never wrote.

23:08.259 --> 23:12.545
Could you imagine him in the bottom of the transfer at night grinding out these diaries?

23:12.585 --> 23:13.726
He was using common sense.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.708
Common sense.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.952
As opposed to common sense and provenance.

23:19.093 --> 23:26.623
The older I get in the field, common sense and provenance, meaning where something came from, are the most important factors in the business.

23:27.304 --> 23:31.189
In today's field, there's a lot of crazy money running around.

23:31.237 --> 23:33.601
Did we see any of it this morning?

23:36.687 --> 23:40.012
It's hard to say, I mean, I don't think.

23:40.032 --> 23:41.695
Look at the glorious books today.

23:41.735 --> 23:46.263
So, I mean, can you say the price on that anthony is too much?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.507
Who bought it, by the way?

23:49.168 --> 23:50.531
It was a telephone there.

23:50.551 --> 23:51.893
It was a told good on that.

23:51.913 --> 23:53.095
Or was it Mags?

23:53.115 --> 23:53.997
No, Mags bought it.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.860
Mags bought it.

23:55.840 --> 24:03.611
I don't think it would have been for Fury.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.055
It could have been Max.

24:06.175 --> 24:16.831
He's kind of managing the business as an advisor, consultant, agent for John Paul Dettie Jr.

24:16.851 --> 24:17.612
who is

24:18.098 --> 24:22.266
The great collector in the world today.

24:22.386 --> 24:26.755
Getty, I mean, maybe Getty bought it.

24:27.196 --> 24:30.783
Maybe Max has another good living on it.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.784
It could well be Getty.

24:31.805 --> 24:36.033
And the books are probably going to slow in everyone.

24:36.073 --> 24:39.820
What do you think of the stories in this world today?

24:39.800 --> 24:42.144
Bob Peary might have been.

24:42.205 --> 24:44.930
I don't know Bob that well.

24:45.811 --> 24:48.797
He might have been after some of the early divings.

24:49.298 --> 24:52.925
I can almost figure out what he was buying.

24:53.466 --> 24:57.353
I wasn't...

24:57.788 --> 25:01.972
He has a fabulous collection.

25:02.332 --> 25:07.277
He's a connoisseur, very knowledgeable, very knowledgeable collector.

25:07.297 --> 25:27.137
When you talk about old smart money versus new dumb money, Bob Perry would be old smart money, meaning your purchases are informed by knowledge and connoisseurship and taste rather than this, I got a lot of money, I want to buy big important books.

25:27.117 --> 25:29.490
That's what's going on in the field about it.

25:29.510 --> 25:33.853
Not to mention names, there's a lot of new dealers about it.

25:34.475 --> 25:37.460
If you put father in the room, they wouldn't know anything.

25:37.480 --> 25:43.590
And they're bidding for guys who don't know anything, but they have a lot of money.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.351
Larry would be great.

25:44.371 --> 25:47.696
I mean, I don't know him, but I would imagine he would be.

25:47.717 --> 25:53.586
He doesn't want to talk about book selling, but he said, I hope I'm going to be able to.

25:53.606 --> 25:57.252
Oh, well, Larry, ask him if you can.

25:57.272 --> 25:58.554
He would be very interesting.

25:58.574 --> 25:59.816
He has been so good.

25:59.876 --> 26:01.579
He sent him two letters in one day.

26:01.559 --> 26:25.660
explaining and the reason he doesn't want to talk about book selling is because he has he said familiarity has bred indifference and he said one day i planned to write an essay on illiteracy in the book okay it's getting worse i said what do you mean by this he said nope i'm not going to you're not going to get me to talk about it but he told me to talk to his partner uh carter um you know

26:25.640 --> 26:34.962
Those of us who have been in the business, I ended the business, I was in the New York University, 63 years ago.

26:35.082 --> 26:37.628
I've been around since now, January 67.

26:37.648 --> 26:39.953
And it'd be like,

26:40.135 --> 26:44.479
the other side of Mars today compared to how it was in 67.

26:44.719 --> 26:57.491
It used to be a gentleman's field, orderly practices or even orderly, great kind of things done in a handshake.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.373
You knew who the collectors were.

27:00.393 --> 27:02.936
People were buying mainly for the love of buying books.

27:02.976 --> 27:04.817
Do you think it's more investment?

27:04.837 --> 27:06.599
I think there's a lot of investment.

27:06.619 --> 27:10.142
Do you think Dick Manning thinks it's more investment?

27:10.122 --> 27:12.546
Whatever you don't want to say.

27:12.566 --> 27:18.375
No, I can say this because you know, I would say Dick Manning is in a couple things.

27:18.435 --> 27:21.560
He's in, he gets in culture.

27:21.620 --> 27:22.141
Culture.

27:22.161 --> 27:22.922
Instant.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.084
Instant culture.

27:24.484 --> 27:29.953
He's in, when there's an auction, he wants to participate in, he likes to go to the auction.

27:29.973 --> 27:34.400
So he gets a lot of nice eagle strokes, massage, oh, there's Dick Manning, you buy this.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.665
He likes to be seen underbidding or buying something.

27:37.645 --> 27:43.573
Does he read the books, like the books, or really what it is?

27:43.613 --> 27:44.153
I don't know.

27:44.233 --> 27:55.047
But if you had a Dick Manny on one end of the seesaw, at an H. Bradley, Martin, or Bob Currie on the other end, you can see the enormous chasm between them.

27:55.067 --> 27:59.033
Well, you know, I asked him why he started collecting books, you know.

27:59.073 --> 28:03.759
How he came to chess, because he does a lot of art to collect.

28:03.779 --> 28:05.661
Yeah, he did art and play, and he took all the curation.

28:06.113 --> 28:28.594
He would have for the average person coming up there to look at the stuff

28:28.574 --> 28:37.626
He would have as much, how can I phrase it, he'd have enough glamour than a faction of the chorus.

28:37.646 --> 28:40.530
How many were the Shakespeare's he paid $2 million for?

28:40.570 --> 28:43.274
Yeah, $2 million.

28:43.314 --> 28:51.405
Most consensus, most feeling is that he overpaid for the thing, and he hasn't really been buying much since then.

28:51.525 --> 28:52.887
No, I've been watching Jim.

28:53.007 --> 28:55.290
I've been watching Jim at every afternoon.

28:55.330 --> 28:56.792
Jim's in it, and Jim drops out.

28:56.772 --> 29:00.938
He really went after the Washington Federalists.

29:01.159 --> 29:02.060
He went after that.

29:02.481 --> 29:09.752
Actually, I was at that sale when John Marion sold, and they apparently had a bid sent in to the auctioneer.

29:10.493 --> 29:22.611
Marion was executing that against Manny, and I think Marion just drew an extra $400,000 or $500,000 out of Manny, because all eyes were on Dick Manny.

29:22.591 --> 29:48.598
You know Michael Zinman?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.821
I know of Michael.

29:50.981 --> 29:53.044
Bill Reese would be more knowledgeable.

29:53.165 --> 29:55.308
Michael, I've met him in his cocktail party.

29:55.328 --> 29:56.610
He's a real coward.

29:57.030 --> 29:58.092
He's a real coward.

29:58.252 --> 29:59.173
He's a wild guy.

29:59.253 --> 30:02.598
I don't know that much about him.

30:02.678 --> 30:06.244
I met him right here at the cocktail party.

30:06.404 --> 30:07.405
Yeah.

30:07.566 --> 30:10.990
But to give you an indication, say where the market is.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.072
In 76,

30:12.473 --> 30:36.675
A young collector named Dr. Gerald E. Slater, a pediatrician from Minneapolis, attended an auction, bought one or two things, and was very interested in 19th century English American literature, and he branched into 18th century.

30:37.145 --> 30:46.395
And he collected from 476, Christie sold his books in spring 82.

30:48.096 --> 30:55.825
Jerry Slater was a major first in the field from about in the late 70s until Hayden Moore came along in the Houghton sales.

30:56.185 --> 30:59.508
And Jerry might have had $75,000 a year to spend.

31:00.610 --> 31:03.392
But he didn't have it as well.

31:03.412 --> 31:05.835
$75,000 in the mid,

31:06.575 --> 31:18.647
mid to late 70s, spent matters a day with good advice from girls, and Jerry was likable, so all the younger girls were giving him really good advice.

31:18.667 --> 31:19.067
Did very well.

31:19.087 --> 31:33.021
He picked up marvelous, super fine copies of Moby Dick and Victorian novels, and then George had some 18th century books, and Jerry got first crap out of buying a tablet, meaning 75,000, 85,000,

31:33.001 --> 31:36.627
A year in 76, 77, 78, 79.

31:36.748 --> 31:41.095
He could really do something.

31:42.257 --> 31:46.224
I think when his book sold, he might have had about $400,000 cost.

31:46.385 --> 31:53.457
We sold it at Christie's, and I think we got about $600,000 and changed, which something sold.

31:53.437 --> 31:58.103
So soon after acquiring it, it's remarkable, particularly in that market that day.

31:58.663 --> 32:08.776
Now, 75... I think probably... It might have been 650,000 gross, maybe a 10% commission.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.779
You kind of made a little money on it.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.802
You didn't lose any money.

32:13.862 --> 32:15.784
He didn't do that well.

32:15.944 --> 32:16.966
He didn't do all that well.

32:17.046 --> 32:18.988
No, but it's only a five-year home.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.177
You know, you're still buying retail and you come at auction.

32:22.358 --> 32:25.013
I know, he didn't drop his money or triple his money.

32:25.381 --> 32:50.832
look if you figure out how well he really did i don't know either you know do you do better with real books than you do with real estate i have some indications that they really lost as well as that sale went i mean i think he lost his ass i think he lost his ass in a couple items if you work out the the way to return less charges and commissions and insurance or whatever

32:50.812 --> 32:55.957
He was getting a divorce with his wife.

32:56.118 --> 33:02.344
I think he's kind of doing it as an investment.

33:02.885 --> 33:06.288
I think he fell in love with books.

33:06.369 --> 33:07.169
I think he liked them.

33:07.229 --> 33:08.211
He's still around.

33:08.271 --> 33:12.415
He's still around, but nobody's heard of him in the field for eight years.

33:12.435 --> 33:15.338
It might be interesting for me to give him a telephone call.

33:15.378 --> 33:17.140
You could give him a telephone call.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.984
I'm going out that way.

33:19.184 --> 33:21.128
I'll tell you who might still have his number.

33:21.369 --> 33:23.272
A person you've got to talk to.

33:23.433 --> 33:26.198
One of the people you've got to talk to is Steve Weissman at Zimite.

33:26.459 --> 33:29.004
I know Steve and I have a nodding acquaintance.

33:29.485 --> 33:30.186
Talk to Steve.

33:30.246 --> 33:33.593
He's really... He's really...

33:33.792 --> 33:38.603
I mean, he has an acute intelligence.

33:39.947 --> 33:42.613
Very sharp in things, you know.

33:42.773 --> 33:46.643
You see, I'm trying to give you names.

33:46.663 --> 33:49.810
There's all kinds of... I'll give you characters, I'll give you...

33:49.790 --> 33:52.757
Solid people who really don't know what to talk about.

33:52.817 --> 33:56.465
You told me that you had the Avalon Morse story to end Avalon Morse stories.

33:56.485 --> 33:56.926
Yeah.

33:56.946 --> 33:58.290
You teased me with that.

33:58.330 --> 34:01.056
Because you can't print it.

34:01.076 --> 34:02.199
Well, you don't know that.

34:02.359 --> 34:04.604
You don't know that.

34:04.744 --> 34:06.769
I've got some great Avalon Morse stories.

34:07.762 --> 34:09.343
We'll get back to the others.

34:09.644 --> 34:20.514
In spring 79, David Moore came down for a boardroom lunch at Christie's.

34:20.534 --> 34:25.859
I was there, Stephen Massey, who I was head of the book department, who started there.

34:25.879 --> 34:33.966
There was a woman named Fanny Neville, who cataloged, worked at Christie's, and I was over here for a while.

34:34.087 --> 34:35.608
It was nice to bring down.

34:35.842 --> 34:38.929
We go back after this nice kind of doozy lunch.

34:40.493 --> 34:49.513
Ava Namor, Steven Massey, myself, Danny Neville Rock, go up to Steven Massey's apartment.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.716
that he stayed thirsty.

34:51.736 --> 34:52.778
And what is the occasion?

34:52.798 --> 34:56.842
The occasion is, there was a lunch, even the Moore came down for his lunch.

34:56.862 --> 35:00.786
And it was one of these great spring bellies, and everybody was in a jolly mood.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.729
They're sitting up at Massey's having drinks.

35:03.570 --> 35:09.336
And Massey's wife was there, who's quite attractive girl from Texas.

35:09.616 --> 35:11.498
Moore's wife was off doing something else.

35:11.959 --> 35:12.620
Maria.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.502
Maria.

35:14.782 --> 35:19.247
Moore at that time had a 600-dollar suit, so when I was today, they had a 300-dollar suit.

35:19.463 --> 35:31.391
Sooner or later, he was telling his life story, how he was raised with the Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, was taught knife fighting.

35:31.572 --> 35:32.494
Sooner or later,

35:32.744 --> 35:41.778
Everybody's edging each other on, and they're kind of showing how they would night fight, or how they would wrestle.

35:41.938 --> 35:48.929
Massey's wife was down to kind of running shorts and a t-shirt, and Moore was down to his jockey shorts.

35:49.169 --> 35:50.111
Part Indian.

35:50.151 --> 35:54.297
They're separated now, or they're divorced.

35:54.277 --> 35:58.125
Do they get into an Indian fight?

35:58.145 --> 35:59.147
They take their clothes off?

35:59.167 --> 36:00.410
Yes, yes.

36:00.430 --> 36:01.011
You hear from me?

36:01.051 --> 36:03.477
I mean, I'll tell you the story.

36:03.497 --> 36:08.688
They're virtually a more stark naked at this point.

36:08.768 --> 36:14.901
Rainey still has her running shorts on.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.604
He was drunk.

36:17.805 --> 36:26.195
I was cold sober, so I didn't drink.

36:26.596 --> 36:35.607
So I was, you know, cold sober watching this stuff.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.033
You wanted to appear cool.

36:38.053 --> 36:40.857
You didn't want to necessarily grieve.

36:41.298 --> 36:42.980
You were curious about what happened.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.646
He was trying to essentially get Stephen's wife in the bedroom.

36:46.666 --> 36:47.808
Or get her to take her clothes off.

36:47.848 --> 36:48.969
He loved the chase.

36:49.009 --> 36:50.572
He loved the chase with her.

36:50.752 --> 36:52.735
He cut his finger.

36:52.715 --> 37:01.326
Lady Massey was trying to, you know, take care of his finger, and Amor was sitting on the couch, like there was not a stitch of clothing on him.

37:01.346 --> 37:20.832
And then, I think he might have put his underpants on after a while, then he began reciting poetry, like this epic poetry, then telling us his life story, about how we can kind of calculate, could he really have been a sergeant in World War II?

37:20.812 --> 37:29.346
very insulting, saying things like, well, I was in World War II, of course, we made the world safe for pansies like Desla.

37:30.488 --> 37:33.172
But Desla was one of the leading books on it.

37:33.593 --> 37:38.821
So it was one like this, kind of a rough purgasmack, in a way.

37:39.122 --> 37:42.347
And I think we're all leading.

37:43.148 --> 37:47.275
And he said, I'm sure you're probably can't wait to tell somebody all about this tomorrow.

37:47.862 --> 37:55.671
Well, we did, and I kind of waited a couple of years, and I said, well, this is too good to tell, because I kept hearing Haven of Moore stories from a tribe or from other people.

37:55.711 --> 37:57.053
That's just wonderful.

37:57.073 --> 37:57.574
That's just wonderful.

37:57.594 --> 37:59.296
Well, there are ties right there.

37:59.356 --> 38:00.597
Yeah, Hebrew newspaper.

38:00.657 --> 38:01.959
Hebrew newspaper.

38:02.039 --> 38:06.304
And you know, you Jews all have all, what do we have all, you know.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.847
So that's a normal Haven of Moore story.

38:08.867 --> 38:15.675
So I always thought Haven was something of a psychopath, you know, or just, you know,

38:15.655 --> 38:16.417
Weird.

38:16.437 --> 38:24.175
Somebody who wrote, like, showed the biographical word he wrote about himself to a major New York psychiatrist.

38:24.195 --> 38:24.817
Yeah.

38:24.917 --> 38:27.142
And said, it's just going to strike me as, what do you think?

38:27.222 --> 38:31.673
I said, the guy, the guy is a fucking nice guy.

38:31.653 --> 38:34.179
He is fucking nuts.

38:34.199 --> 38:36.444
I'm telling you the same quote-unquote.

38:36.505 --> 38:39.492
He said, I'm just quoting the job.

38:39.512 --> 38:43.481
The ultimate of us is sitting on this couch doing this and wearing masks.

38:43.501 --> 38:44.323
He's coming back.

38:44.884 --> 38:47.310
And he said, maybe I can get her.

38:48.252 --> 38:49.375
Maybe I can get her.

38:49.996 --> 39:18.889
you have a very chasable wife

39:18.869 --> 39:41.772
but that was it i'm sitting right on the settee he's sitting he said oh what was it because they were fixing his from somebody scratches you know we did miss you did miss what how the actual fight because i knew well they're kind of they're tussling around he says no you can fight better if you take your clothes off that's how he said she said he said

39:41.752 --> 39:43.615
And what did she say?

39:44.116 --> 39:45.398
She didn't strip down anymore.

39:45.438 --> 39:48.804
She still had her running shorts on and her bra on.

39:48.904 --> 39:52.170
But she was... She was leading them on, too, in a way.

39:52.230 --> 39:55.796
It was like a party scene, and you thought it was innocent.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.521
But he kept saying, I can't fight with these clothes on.

39:58.541 --> 39:59.963
Did you ever talk books with him?

40:01.006 --> 40:11.723
He would ask my advice on American literature, and what you told Haven, you'd just say, Haven, you got the greatest copies of the greatest books.

40:11.924 --> 40:12.244
Do I?

40:12.264 --> 40:12.905
Do I have the best?

40:12.965 --> 40:14.448
Is that the best copy you've ever seen?

40:14.468 --> 40:16.371
Yes, Haven, the best copy you've ever seen.

40:16.391 --> 40:28.110
Because he was such a hot fish in the field that the one time we tried to give him advice at Christie's, Horwich said, don't upset the apricot in the sale we're trying to make.

40:28.090 --> 40:40.307
I mean, said to them, said to us, like Christians, because they were trying to, we recommended that we buy another coffee, and they were trying to sell them an inferior coffee.

40:40.327 --> 40:45.173
You know, I mean, look, in that field, you've got a guy who's spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

40:45.594 --> 40:48.438
How did he arrive in the sea there, Mr. King?

40:48.458 --> 40:49.339
Did he arrive?

40:49.825 --> 40:59.290
In 75 I heard, it kind of just appeared, I heard about some couple from New England buying books.

40:59.430 --> 41:02.097
I was at Thelman's in 76.

41:02.735 --> 41:14.830
diamonds on vacation to Bermuda, I'm there packing books with a t-shirt on, and jeans, and somebody comes up, his wife woman only, and my dad is saving him on his wife, and I said, I thought that was a bad.

41:14.850 --> 41:20.197
So they came up, and I showed him some things, which they bought, eventually.

41:20.217 --> 41:22.860
In fact, I took him up to Boston, at Johnson's Dictionary.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.742
Did you move on to his house?

41:24.762 --> 41:30.970
No, I was met, and his wife, and his majordomo, who was,

41:30.950 --> 41:48.570
I was met at Back Bay Station and I just put the package in the back of the back of the station rocket and it happened there.

41:48.550 --> 41:49.752
It's like the baby.

41:49.993 --> 41:53.740
It's like the Shakespeare's up to the house.

41:53.940 --> 41:54.261
Yeah.

41:54.301 --> 41:55.042
Everybody wanted to know.

41:55.062 --> 41:56.906
And this story's really made the rounds.

41:56.926 --> 41:57.206
Yeah.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.348
It's locked in the door.

41:58.589 --> 42:00.412
And I've been to the house now.

42:01.314 --> 42:02.055
I know where it is.

42:02.296 --> 42:03.438
Asked to come in.

42:03.698 --> 42:05.221
Asked if we could use the bathroom.

42:05.381 --> 42:07.145
Where do you want to come in and see the camera?

42:07.165 --> 42:09.449
Because there's a gas station in the house.

42:09.469 --> 42:09.529
No.

42:09.509 --> 42:12.934
I think the only dealer in the mind was Franklin.

42:12.954 --> 42:14.096
He never liked Franklin.

42:14.116 --> 42:17.881
Arthur Freeman might have gotten inside the investment.

42:18.021 --> 42:19.684
Arthur Freeman did.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.286
Arthur would be good on Haven.

42:21.366 --> 42:22.408
I thought that.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.010
Arthur would be good.

42:24.110 --> 42:26.694
I always thought Haven was investing.

42:26.714 --> 42:29.017
I thought Haven was pure investment.

42:29.237 --> 42:36.588
Did you ever have any idea that there was a young guy putting all the money into this?

42:37.129 --> 42:38.070
All of the money?

42:38.090 --> 42:38.250
No.

42:38.391 --> 42:39.432
I thought it was something.

42:39.412 --> 42:50.721
At one point at Feldman's in 76, before I left, in spring 76, we had heard at Feldman's about some science collection in northern Italy.

42:52.104 --> 42:56.475
Feldman or Moore bought a copy of the Copernicus.

42:56.455 --> 42:58.581
Similar copies sold today.

42:58.741 --> 43:01.670
Didn't he buy one of the stolen ones out of Chicago, too?

43:01.730 --> 43:05.380
He bought the Harvey, the Mortal Corpus.

43:05.901 --> 43:07.827
There's a wonderful story about that.

43:07.907 --> 43:10.193
I mean, Alex, you gotta have a meeting.

43:10.214 --> 43:11.477
I mean, the lawyers were there.

43:11.457 --> 43:14.363
And the way I get up with the book, he kept here.

43:14.383 --> 43:17.950
He said, get your hands off my book.

43:18.210 --> 43:22.699
I mean, the psychiatrist you show, I always start.

43:22.879 --> 43:29.652
I used to tell Stephen, I told other people from early on, this guy is a nut.

43:29.632 --> 43:33.255
Did you ever tell me about the Institute of Traditional Science?

43:33.876 --> 43:37.239
That was the early, early institute where we used to bill.

43:37.399 --> 43:42.744
We used to send, make out the invoices to that institution.

43:42.844 --> 43:47.408
And you said it was a post office?

43:47.488 --> 43:49.590
A post office, yes.

43:49.610 --> 43:59.419
Well, to make the story short, we were going to go, at one point in 76, in the madness, Haven Amour and I and some English dealer were going to fly to Italy

43:59.753 --> 44:04.759
to bring the science collection into Switzerland, which was smuggling, and then try to get it into the States.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.582
Thank God it all fell through.

44:06.842 --> 44:16.554
It was a stone, but it was very difficult to get books out of Italy, so this had been stuff that had been driven across the border.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.937
I mean, thank God it never worked out.

44:18.957 --> 44:22.842
But that's the kind of thing that the world was involved in, wanted to get involved in.

44:22.822 --> 44:26.566
I think it is opposed to me.

44:27.027 --> 44:30.310
It sounded like something.

44:30.330 --> 44:34.795
It sounded like some tax commitment to me.

44:35.035 --> 44:36.277
No, exactly.

44:36.297 --> 44:42.944
I've got the papers that he filed with the Secretary of State Office.

44:43.044 --> 44:46.728
I mean, it was an education foundation.

44:46.748 --> 44:50.112
They were buying these checks so they could capture the energy to contain

44:50.092 --> 45:09.619
I came across an advertisement of early yoga film demonstrating some modus positions.

45:09.599 --> 45:15.588
I think Fred was regaling us with his name.

45:15.689 --> 45:19.675
Ask Fred if he remembers.

45:19.755 --> 45:22.139
It was either Fred or somebody else we know.

45:22.199 --> 45:32.175
I'd seen an ad for a videotape of Haven Amore, taken in the early 70s, demonstrating a yoga position.

45:32.575 --> 45:33.657
He used to stay at Fleming's.

45:33.777 --> 45:35.640
He used to come to town.

45:35.620 --> 45:38.426
Well, he would buy a lot from coming.

45:38.446 --> 45:39.328
He was safe at the PA.

45:39.348 --> 45:40.190
He loved the PA.

45:40.270 --> 45:42.315
But there were times he stayed at London's place.

45:42.555 --> 45:44.940
They would keep a bottle of his special brandy.

45:45.201 --> 45:50.693
The woman I spoke with at the work there, she's in London now.

45:50.673 --> 45:57.363
He would have the same blue silk robe, and he would get up in the morning, and he would still get stiff.

45:57.424 --> 46:02.171
You see, John could handle, from the old Rosenberg, John could handle these vows.

46:02.191 --> 46:04.675
We must forgive him because he loves books so much.

46:04.935 --> 46:08.261
We must forgive him because he spends a lot of money.

46:08.281 --> 46:10.504
We're trying to be one of the tourists.

46:10.484 --> 46:16.089
I mean, Moore might have loved books for some really spooky reason.

46:16.109 --> 46:18.031
It's going to be a really terrific chapter.

46:18.051 --> 46:21.975
I mean, you know, his name is... Have you heard that?

46:22.075 --> 46:23.156
I've heard that from Arthur.

46:23.176 --> 46:25.318
In fact, Arthur cracked that joke after.

46:25.338 --> 46:27.240
No, he has been known to say this.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.082
Hey, you know what my name is?

46:29.402 --> 46:35.829
I mean, I've been able to find no record of the guy prior to the 50s or the 60s, and I've been looking at him.

46:35.869 --> 46:36.930
This is an interesting story.

46:36.990 --> 46:40.373
You see, because this was, in terms of lot average,

46:40.353 --> 46:42.858
a private collection for him.

46:43.018 --> 46:50.974
I mean, it was quite electrifying to sell 300 items, 150 lots, 16 million dollars, formed over a 15 year period.

46:51.555 --> 46:56.505
I'd always wanted, I didn't have the time and whether I could do it this summer, would be to break down

46:56.485 --> 47:06.038
A lot of his costs would be available from dealers, right down exactly within 90% of what the actual costs are.

47:06.138 --> 47:07.520
Are you thinking of doing that?

47:07.540 --> 47:08.401
It takes a lot of time.

47:08.561 --> 47:10.303
I thought I'd do it.

47:11.104 --> 47:14.008
Even on a random set of maybe 10 racks?

47:14.028 --> 47:18.274
No, I think you've got to do it more complete because there was some evenness in the sale.

47:18.254 --> 47:24.025
In a sense, are real books and manuscripts a great investment, or are they not a great investment?

47:24.045 --> 47:35.487
Here's a classic case of a library, I swear, formed for investments from 75 until late 70s, 70, 80, probably stopped by.

47:36.007 --> 47:37.790
These are the costs.

47:37.810 --> 47:40.273
You give it to an accountant, you break down the rate of return.

47:40.293 --> 47:42.817
The litigation started in January of the year.

47:42.837 --> 47:47.864
Not getting involved with legal fees, just what the books cost and what the books realize.

47:48.244 --> 47:53.452
And if you're an average person to have these books, would you come out better than the bank, come out better than Wall Street?

47:53.472 --> 47:56.496
Except the South East is projecting $10 million.

47:56.678 --> 48:01.383
Well, we did an appraisal with the Christie's, who I'm a consultant in.

48:01.524 --> 48:04.707
We said the books are worth 11 million.

48:04.727 --> 48:06.970
We were angling to get the business.

48:07.230 --> 48:09.292
Sotheby's was angling to get the business.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.736
They used our figure of 11 million dollars.

48:13.237 --> 48:20.205
What other reasons, what other inducements were provided, we don't know.

48:20.185 --> 48:21.006
I didn't.

48:21.106 --> 48:21.988
Massey went.

48:22.148 --> 48:24.692
Steven Massey went.

48:24.812 --> 48:30.141
Steve Weissman went up to work on the appraiser.

48:30.241 --> 48:35.710
A lot of it was next to a Moores house in Cambridge.

48:35.790 --> 48:40.257
Books were piled up like this, not in bookshelves, all wrapped up in tissue and paper.

48:40.518 --> 48:41.640
It never even been opened.

48:41.660 --> 48:44.304
They were opened and then wrapped up again.

48:44.324 --> 48:46.868
They had to take their shoes off and they walked into the house.

48:46.848 --> 48:51.017
And they thought that Moore was looking at him from the house next door through this window.

48:51.979 --> 48:54.244
You know, an American pocket.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.185
Steve Weissman?

48:55.226 --> 48:56.829
I think Steve Weissman went up with him.

48:56.849 --> 48:58.933
Yeah, Steve Weissman, Felix Oyens at L.C.

48:59.034 --> 49:01.178
Harper.

49:01.968 --> 49:04.411
Stephen Massey working the appraisal.

49:04.431 --> 49:08.295
And I said, I kept telling Stephen, I don't want to go up there, the guy's in that case.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.358
You know, the guy's in that case.

49:12.699 --> 49:14.361
I don't like the guy.

49:15.062 --> 49:25.613
A lot of it was in bank vaults, but it was brought out of bank vaults and put in the... I think it was brought out of the bank vaults and brought, a lot of it was brought into...

49:25.981 --> 49:28.484
this totally empty room in one of the houses.

49:28.644 --> 49:30.767
He had his furniture in the house.

49:30.807 --> 49:32.589
Massey could give you all that.

49:32.649 --> 49:36.174
I should talk to Massey.

49:36.194 --> 49:38.056
You should talk to Massey.

49:38.697 --> 49:40.639
He might be a little difficult to talk to.

49:40.719 --> 49:41.520
I don't know.

49:41.640 --> 49:44.664
I mean, he might be all right.

49:44.684 --> 49:45.745
Call him and say, look, you're right.

49:46.206 --> 49:47.307
Give him your credentials.

49:47.327 --> 49:49.790
You've been talking to members, significant members.

49:49.991 --> 49:51.212
You've been talking to everybody.

49:51.192 --> 49:55.757
And a big part of the book should be a big chapter on Haven No More as a collector.

49:55.817 --> 49:59.422
It's called The Have No More.

49:59.482 --> 50:07.731
Well, as the author said, after I even bought some stuff myself, Have No More, I mean, Have No More Money.

50:08.872 --> 50:11.035
Well, that's the title of my final chapter.

50:11.055 --> 50:11.796
Have No More.

50:11.896 --> 50:13.097
It's a winner.

50:13.117 --> 50:18.243
Well, I got the influence of... No, I'm fine, because I'm not going back.

50:18.263 --> 50:19.765
Let's set up the...

50:20.352 --> 50:22.016
They set up the Garden Limited Trust.

50:22.176 --> 50:24.943
They set that up in Poughkeepsie, New York, of all places.

50:24.963 --> 50:27.028
I mean, it should be in Massachusetts.

50:27.769 --> 50:29.694
I finally found it in Poughkeepsie.

50:29.874 --> 50:31.037
And this guy gave

50:31.574 --> 50:34.217
brought in $23 million to this kid.

50:34.237 --> 50:40.385
He must have been under some kind of... Well, as we know, I mean, you get a guru under influence of something.

50:40.866 --> 50:44.871
The court has impounded all the papers.

50:45.271 --> 50:47.174
I think I can get them if I decide to sue.

50:47.214 --> 50:49.196
I may, if you know.

50:49.216 --> 50:54.703
But I was able to get a copy of the court docket before the judge impounded the case.

50:55.104 --> 50:58.628
I've been using this docket as kind of a Rosetta store that's just directed me

50:58.895 --> 51:21.713
Do you know Diverse Bowls?

51:22.064 --> 51:23.485
I've spent an evening of that.

51:23.866 --> 51:24.867
They're fantastic.

51:24.907 --> 51:25.868
This is what I mean.

51:25.888 --> 51:35.678
What I was saying before about collectors on one side and what I call buyers on the other side.

51:35.758 --> 51:45.869
Burst buyers, Curie, Shidey, Lady Eccles, Bob Taylor who passed away a couple years ago.

51:46.069 --> 51:50.113
These are connoisseurs, true book collectors.

51:50.279 --> 51:53.065
I don't know if Carlton Lake done well.

51:53.085 --> 52:01.744
I think Carlton Lake as a curator in French literature and manuscripts from Texas is marvelous.

52:02.225 --> 52:05.352
He's one of the few people in the United States that know their way around French literature.

52:05.372 --> 52:09.300
Well, I went to, I mean, I went to France.

52:09.533 --> 52:11.215
They said, what did you go to France for us?

52:11.255 --> 52:15.321
Because I had heard that his collection is preeminent in the United States for what it is.

52:15.702 --> 52:17.504
But I didn't want an American telling me that.

52:17.564 --> 52:19.127
I wanted the French people out there.

52:19.147 --> 52:20.749
Well, they say that over there.

52:20.769 --> 52:22.211
But that's why it went to France.

52:22.311 --> 52:27.378
But there wouldn't be, you wouldn't have much competition over here because we can't even sell Rambeau letters to any great price.

52:27.398 --> 52:27.599
Yeah.

52:27.619 --> 52:30.683
You know, very, very little interest in French letters.

52:30.703 --> 52:32.065
America is very provincial.

52:32.045 --> 52:33.006
Let me ask you one other thing.

52:33.026 --> 52:37.790
Because there's a lot of continental dealers over here today buying, but Flores is a leading Parisian dealer.

52:37.990 --> 52:38.791
He's a dealer.

52:38.811 --> 52:42.995
He could have been buying for his inventory, buying for collectors.

52:43.035 --> 52:45.237
Schiller buys through Quaritch, I think.

52:45.257 --> 52:46.418
André Schiller?

52:46.438 --> 52:47.519
Schiller, yeah.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.761
He buys through Quaritch, sometimes through Krauss.

52:49.861 --> 52:51.983
He bought the Carlos Moore, I think he then was.

52:52.744 --> 52:54.005
He really was buying for them.

52:54.025 --> 52:55.787
Sometimes he buys through Krauss over here.

52:57.809 --> 52:59.250
Roland Falter at

52:59.618 --> 53:09.841
You can use my name with all these people.

53:09.861 --> 53:12.868
I mean, say, you're writing this book for Random House.

53:13.253 --> 53:15.576
You've talked to lots of people.

53:15.596 --> 53:16.277
Lots of people.

53:16.317 --> 53:27.633
Put your credentials out, because what the booksellers are afraid of is, here's a nice old lady doing another, let's collect real books for fun and profit, and you're not doing that.

53:27.693 --> 53:34.042
The last letter I got to Larry McMurtry was yesterday, and he said, look, I think he's going to come around, because he wants me to practice.

53:34.242 --> 53:39.750
You know, it would be great to get Larry to write an introduction for your breakfast, but he's written me three letters on it.

53:39.950 --> 53:41.392
He's a great idea.

53:41.412 --> 53:46.058
He was getting elected, gave me a guy in Tennessee to talk to.

53:46.078 --> 53:53.569
Anyway, but Larry, a lady at this, who I spoke with and had a nice letter from, she's afraid of security.

53:53.589 --> 53:55.611
She doesn't want to talk too much about this.

53:55.872 --> 53:57.835
Talk to me briefly.

53:57.935 --> 54:05.485
The Coke sale was a disaster last week.

54:05.667 --> 54:07.931
If you analyze it, not necessarily so.

54:08.431 --> 54:14.000
I think the Christie estimate might have been 950,000 or 12, 1.2 million.

54:14.061 --> 54:23.015
Some of the problems were this, that 99% of the stock is purchased at all.

54:23.696 --> 54:28.945
In the past eight years, which means it's too fresh on the market.

54:28.965 --> 54:29.545
What does that mean?

54:29.886 --> 54:32.991
Meaning, you know, if you buy something at a big sale,

54:33.292 --> 54:40.109
for $5,000 and then three years later you're putting it up at auction again, you may not get any kind of appreciation on it.

54:40.129 --> 54:41.853
The material is just like it's been on the market.

54:41.873 --> 54:44.500
It's like a woman who's been all over town.

54:44.716 --> 54:49.643
You know, she's not new, she's not striking, it's not a surprise, oh, there that is again.

54:49.763 --> 54:53.309
It might be interesting, it might be valuable, it loses its appeal.

54:53.469 --> 54:56.934
Why do you suppose the Pope Institute said this?

54:57.695 --> 55:04.345
I think what it is, is that one of the foundations, a couple of foundations, was funded

55:05.287 --> 55:10.615
to buy literature and manuscripts five, six, seven, eight years ago.

55:10.635 --> 55:16.042
And I think for tax reasons, no more capital, no more funding can go in that corporation.

55:16.523 --> 55:20.709
He's just reorganizing, reordering the priorities maybe to buy music.

55:21.490 --> 55:25.596
Is he a collector in the 50th sense?

55:25.636 --> 55:30.062
He already shut it off?

55:30.582 --> 55:43.155
He thought that when Massey said past, he didn't know what was going on.

55:43.596 --> 55:51.724
He thought he didn't realize the things that were past.

55:51.764 --> 55:54.027
42 lots did not sell.

55:54.227 --> 55:57.130
About eight of those sold after the sale of the reserves.

55:57.683 --> 56:01.389
Out of those 42, you must have earned.

56:01.409 --> 56:01.950
It's enormous.

56:02.130 --> 56:02.611
It's enormous.

56:03.432 --> 56:11.125
Not out of line with some of the other sales that were happening this spring, but in dollar terms, it was only 10% less than the low estimate.

56:11.145 --> 56:11.726
It was only 10%.

56:11.746 --> 56:14.411
There were a lot of the technical problems with the material.

56:14.591 --> 56:16.614
He was a major force in buying wild.

56:16.734 --> 56:19.339
He was a major force in buying drones.

56:19.359 --> 56:21.322
He was a major force in buying food.

56:21.342 --> 56:23.826
So you take one of the major buyers out,

56:23.806 --> 56:30.436
the major buyer is selling, there's been so much boost on the market.

56:30.456 --> 56:36.626
Third reason, the American market for French literature is virtually non-aggressive.

56:36.786 --> 56:38.709
Is Carl Carlton Lake represented there, do you know?

56:38.789 --> 56:44.138
No, because Carlton didn't come, Beres didn't come, none of the French dealers really participated in the sale.

56:44.598 --> 56:47.503
And maybe perhaps it wasn't that interesting to him.

56:47.603 --> 56:49.386
Maybe the stuff wasn't that good?

56:49.406 --> 56:50.628
Maybe it wasn't that or that good.

56:50.648 --> 56:51.349
Maybe it wasn't

56:51.650 --> 56:56.876
It might be unusual in New York to see Rambo letters, but in Paris, maybe it's not all that unusual.

56:56.936 --> 56:58.178
There's been a ton of proof stuff.

56:58.198 --> 57:00.661
There's been some fabulous French sales going on.

57:00.701 --> 57:02.163
Were they substantive letters?

57:02.203 --> 57:03.444
Were they talking about their art?

57:03.604 --> 57:15.198
Yeah, they were good letters, but then again, he paid a lot for them, so the estimates and therefore the reserves were higher than what the American market would buy.

57:15.879 --> 57:17.421
And also, there's been a...

57:17.857 --> 57:21.682
vast quantity of literary material, Martin, Gordon.

57:22.283 --> 57:32.577
I mean, this past season has been, from last June to now, from the beginning of Martin, has been electrifying, and that's been good on the American... You can even go earlier with the Gohenies, actually.

57:32.637 --> 57:46.136
You can go, well, this follows Gohenies, so from, from, uh, from 487 to now, you're talking about, Gordon, you're talking about, just in New York, you're talking about a hundred million bucks worth of books out there.

57:46.216 --> 57:47.678
I'm running at peace, I hope.

57:48.063 --> 57:50.854
from the New York Times, an essay.

57:52.098 --> 57:57.659
Becky Sinclair is a book writer, and she's quite interested in this piece.

57:57.740 --> 57:59.406
And I said, yeah, $100 million.

57:59.572 --> 58:03.918
But if you had a Japanese who spent $150 million for two paintings, this is it.

58:04.058 --> 58:05.359
Imagine if you were to sit there.

58:05.439 --> 58:06.160
You had this money.

58:06.341 --> 58:14.131
Look, my thought is... You stand up and put together one of the finest... Look, now this is my point.

58:14.231 --> 58:27.908
For what that Japanese, for what our Japanese friend paid for two super obvious masterworks, you could have thought, let's say, it would cost you more money, but let's say for the same amount,

58:28.360 --> 58:33.068
Doheny could have Doheny, Garden, Olive Garden, Olive Garden.

58:33.128 --> 58:38.757
You would have been instantly one of the great collectors in the history of the world.

58:38.937 --> 58:44.566
And the proposal I have to the Times, and have 20 million left over to build an extraordinary building for it.

58:45.607 --> 58:48.652
You would have been instantly... I mean, the building you could build for.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.495
You would have been a national treasure.

58:50.615 --> 58:55.363
You would have been going down in history as one of the great books and manuscript collectors.

58:55.580 --> 58:56.782
in the Western War.

58:57.023 --> 59:01.612
You would have been compared to Huntington who did a similar kind of a thing at the turn of the century.

59:01.692 --> 59:02.995
It would have been magnificent.

59:03.075 --> 59:06.342
It's kind of what Texas did in its own way.

59:06.522 --> 59:08.446
It's kind of what Texas did as an institution.

59:08.466 --> 59:09.989
You see, I've got a continuum.

59:10.510 --> 59:13.977
Texas got into the field as a collector.

59:14.699 --> 59:17.382
There were two collectors, it was Ransom and there was Loved.

59:17.402 --> 59:19.905
Let's get the stuff, get the money, you get the stuff.

59:19.945 --> 59:21.386
That is my chapter, basically.

59:21.887 --> 59:22.607
They fit right in.

59:22.627 --> 59:24.069
I'm an institution of Bibliomania.

59:24.149 --> 59:24.770
Yeah.

59:24.790 --> 59:25.571
There's such a thing.

59:25.631 --> 59:26.011
There is.

59:26.211 --> 59:27.172
Roger started this.

59:27.332 --> 59:31.277
You know, Bineke came pretty close, but that's the deal.

59:31.297 --> 59:32.218
Right, we need it.

59:32.278 --> 59:34.039
No, it has to be in Texas.

59:34.220 --> 59:38.344
Take a look at what Bineke was doing around the same time.
