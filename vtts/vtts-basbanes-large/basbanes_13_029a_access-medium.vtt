WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:16.943
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:18.425 --> 00:41.867
welcome back if you can see the treasures of the library um

00:42.117 --> 00:45.641
Thank you again to this morning's speaker.

00:45.661 --> 00:53.370
We're hoping that this panel this afternoon will be able to pick up that conversation, keep it equally honest and lively.

00:55.713 --> 01:05.104
Just to give you a sense of the format, this is moderated only in the sense that questions will be thrown out by me for now.

01:05.945 --> 01:11.152
And as the conversation continues, we will be able to open up for questions towards the end.

01:11.553 --> 01:14.337
We're going to go until 3.30, where we're ready for coffee.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.683
You'll dutifully come back 15 minutes later.

01:18.703 --> 01:23.090
And we'll close up with the morning speakers at the table.

01:23.110 --> 01:27.876
I'm open for questions and summaries.

01:27.896 --> 01:32.543
We heard much this morning that we could all learn from, phrases that stick in our minds,

01:33.350 --> 01:48.093
the differences between caretaking and stewardship, film references, references to anthropology, whole notion and vocabulary of how we can approach this interesting and dynamic relationship between librarians and collectors and dealers.

01:49.796 --> 01:57.248
To my left this afternoon, I have a panel of individuals who each represent an aspect of this equation.

01:57.616 --> 02:11.141
I'm going to only briefly introduce them because we've asked each of them to speak for a few minutes to talk about their relationship to this subject, their experience, what they might be able to bring to the conversation that we've had this morning.

02:11.161 --> 02:16.030
And by way of that, we'll introduce themselves further in terms of talking about their own background.

02:16.010 --> 02:22.301
To the left of me is Selby Kuyper, Senior Vice President for Books and Manuscripts at Sotheby's New York.

02:23.022 --> 02:29.533
For most of you, the face of recent sales at Sotheby's on Book TV.

02:29.853 --> 02:41.393
Recovered from a youthful indiscretion of reading Book Tarkington and has moved on to American history expertise at Sotheby's and is well known to many others.

02:41.373 --> 03:07.754
Next to him, Edmund Lincoln from New York, a very considerate and precise collector by day, investment banker by night, a collector of books about architecture, decorative arts, and a very significant collection of library and collection catalogs.

03:07.894 --> 03:09.557
Next to him, Marilee Taylor,

03:09.908 --> 03:24.171
uh university librarian brown university uh at heart a special collections librarian always good friends in special collections both at her institution and also nationally has been very active in

03:24.961 --> 03:43.571
perpetuating and promoting the notion of special collections to other university library administrators, but also participates as an instructor in advanced courses of rare books and special collections librarianship, and certainly a friend to librarians in this room.

03:43.891 --> 03:50.462
Next to her, John Warnock, who could wear many hats at this table, but the one he's wearing today is a book collector.

03:50.695 --> 04:07.185
who came by way of his book collecting drew an interest in science and technology, which has a lot to do with the fact that he just recently announced that he is now the former CEO of WU and the individual behind Octavo Institute of Books.

04:07.823 --> 04:16.261
and a distinguished collector whose own collection he's making available slowly but surely through Octavo Books.

04:16.281 --> 04:23.537
Just as an aside before I turn this over to the panel, this is in the spirit of this morning's conversation where it doesn't hurt to ask

04:23.922 --> 04:25.566
You don't get what you don't ask for.

04:25.586 --> 04:30.057
But also, I would add a spin to that, which is you must be careful how you ask for it.

04:31.621 --> 04:34.027
John was recently visiting the Library of Congress.

04:34.709 --> 04:41.205
We took the opportunity to pull out a variety of materials from the Rare Book and Special Collections Division collections.

04:41.573 --> 04:47.822
in part to show off, in part to play the game of whose copy is better.

04:48.664 --> 05:00.281
And in the process of doing that, I had bemoaned the fact that the Library of Congress lacked a copy of Galileo Sidereus Numidius.

05:01.122 --> 05:02.805
Sorry, Messenger, which of course I knew.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.782
John Warnock owned.

05:05.882 --> 05:12.197
It was a very touching conversation.

05:12.417 --> 05:21.317
Today, I'm very pleased to say that I was presented with a digital...

05:28.638 --> 05:40.130
So, to the lessons that we've learned this morning, I would add, it all comes up what you're really asking for.

05:40.150 --> 05:52.924
So, with all of that, I will turn it over to Selby to kick it off, and I'll just ask for you to pick up until we get finished.

05:55.604 --> 06:08.059
I would hope that everyone here would be as willing as Bill Reese expressed to its own meaning for any impressions of my employer, so I'm not sure that would be the case for everyone here.

06:08.079 --> 06:17.410
But I've been struck by the listed understanding, I think, of the topic today and the conversations this morning that there's a

06:18.689 --> 06:31.230
conflict between what libraries want private collectors to do and what perhaps the trade of which I am one element, private dealers, some of the other elements, what they want them to do in their works.

06:32.273 --> 06:40.084
I think that private collectors really can offer so much more and do offer so much more than simply a donation of their books.

06:40.104 --> 06:56.408
It's what they do in identifying new topics for collecting and in building collections that lead to other collectors taking up the challenge of bibliographies and so forth and to think of just the

06:57.097 --> 07:01.588
end result of their collecting being what the fruits of their labors are.

07:02.249 --> 07:03.212
A little short-sighted.

07:05.036 --> 07:13.637
Something else that perhaps by self-preservation, I have to believe in and disagree with something else that was said this morning.

07:14.140 --> 07:32.790
the ultimate heiress material we firmly believe property keeps turning off either in traditional ways or that collectors identify new areas to collect them phil mentioned the dunlap broadside of the declaration of independence and

07:33.142 --> 07:47.245
I thought, as I often have, that since the Library of Congress did its bicentennial census, five more copies of that, including probably three of the finest copies, have come to light.

07:47.265 --> 07:51.572
The academic world has accepted completely that the

07:52.632 --> 08:11.620
first half of the huckleberry min pardon me huckleberry finn manuscript was lost as you can imagine we get calls all of the time from people offering a scoop for a bible and declarations of independence and getting further addresses none of which turned out to be uh seldom turned out to be

08:12.477 --> 08:13.881
what we think they are.

08:13.901 --> 08:17.131
The colleague of mine was on the phone with a lady in California.

08:17.772 --> 08:22.185
And he said, with just a moment, we call it over and tell me, where's the man who served the Buckleberry Finn at?

08:22.205 --> 08:24.833
And I said, at the Buffalo Public Library.

08:25.049 --> 08:33.240
and it goes back to this is usually a promotion that I yell over, but it's just the second half.

08:33.260 --> 08:40.110
Well, the first half turned out to be rediscovered and is now the second half after talking to the public.

08:40.130 --> 08:53.048
So I think that there will continue to be books available and that private collectors will be motivated by gathering them because they have the private collectors now.

08:53.821 --> 09:06.632
information and information to offer as it goes simply beyond that I think

09:07.169 --> 09:19.156
You know, I'm here really, I hope a modest witness to all the good things that Special Collections Library can do in terms of mentorship and access.

09:20.599 --> 09:25.009
Bob Jackson said for the way you develop support.

09:24.989 --> 09:53.815
i'm really here to talk a bit about the relationship i've had with i think a classical example of a certain example of a special collections library that is the winter tour museum outside wilmington delaware winter tour i hope is a place that many of you visited most of you visited i hope many of you know the collections and you all should if you don't and we're fortunate here to have very coolie who's the director of the library and his

09:54.217 --> 10:06.098
related academic programs here today, Rich McKinstry, who's the manuscript librarian, so they will be happy to correct me if I make a statement and tell you, I'm sure, more about the institution.

10:06.118 --> 10:16.697
But I'm looking for a library which serves a unique American museum country estate that I think most of us know as being unrivaled for its

10:17.268 --> 10:23.034
study and collections of early American decorative arts and their British and continental origins.

10:23.094 --> 10:33.404
In this respect, its only rivals our problem with DNA, Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, and in certain areas, the Cooper Hewitt and the Metropolitan Museum.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.546
But it's really much more than that.

10:35.586 --> 10:40.971
It's a series of many other collections, if not just architectural furniture pattern books.

10:40.991 --> 10:46.937
I mean, they're a superb collection of early American imprints, training catalogs, business records, inventories.

10:47.238 --> 10:58.152
Manuscripts, gardening material, women's history collection, shaker imprints, goes on and on and on, I believe, of which are from estate management and scientific farming.

10:58.172 --> 11:16.975
I had the great good fortune growing up outside of Wilmington and being interested in furniture and the decorative arts, being able to work in this library when I was in high school back in the mid-1960s, and getting to use some of the pattern books there, and then

11:17.461 --> 11:31.740
Even better, when I got out of college from September of 71 to September of 72, having a main position really as an acting rare book librarian during a hiatus between two professional appointments,

11:32.227 --> 12:00.732
um this is just wonderful it gave me a chance to learn about a hobby get paid for doing it getting to know a collection a collection in a very tactile intimate way there's a time when i could point out identify immediately every location of every rare book on the shelves you can do that if you have 25 or 30 40 000 titles uh reflections bigger today and i couldn't do it but it was really one of the great formative experiences of my life and

12:00.847 --> 12:15.122
As a result of that, I have tried to support the library primarily through donations over a period now that would extend at least over 30 years.

12:15.242 --> 12:29.757
And it's been a way of saying thank you over that period of three decades for the kindnesses and consideration that were shown to me by Frank Sommer, who was in the director, and to a lesser extent by Charlie Montgomery.

12:30.209 --> 12:33.053
Charles Van Riemen's way, who were directors of the museum.

12:33.073 --> 12:35.336
And these are people you don't forget.

12:35.356 --> 12:48.475
And my own collecting interest, as Mark said, initially began to be focused on architecture and ornament and decoration with a little more of a continental orientation.

12:49.296 --> 12:59.490
But what I've tried to do is to give the library gifts that really complement the collections they have.

12:59.791 --> 13:26.608
uh in many cases these are not high spot books because um the library was buying in the early 50s from people like bassford where you could walk and just sweep the shelves there for the second world war before these pattern books became fashionable and so they have they have robert adams with contemporary coloring and they have you know the uh hamilton studies and things of this kind but um

13:27.348 --> 13:45.034
Material that's filled in, for example, books in Middle European books written by Jesuits, priests on architecture, publishing prices like Vienna, Prague, and Trieste, which are all parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the second half of the 18th century.

13:45.054 --> 13:46.796
These are the kind of things that are filled there.

13:47.357 --> 13:49.460
Bibliography, some continental material.

13:50.301 --> 13:54.908
And it's given me a lot of pleasure to do this, and I think it's been useful because

13:55.327 --> 13:58.451
You know exactly who's going to be using the material.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.996
There are no questions about hypothetical issues, but will it be appreciated?

14:03.056 --> 14:04.098
Will it be used?

14:04.118 --> 14:15.291
And there's also a very, very important conservation laboratory effort and post-master's degree program associated with winter tours.

14:15.392 --> 14:19.056
Though things go wrong, they are able to

14:19.492 --> 14:23.780
correct climate problems and damage and deterioration problems.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.144
There's some expertise in the finding area.

14:26.224 --> 14:29.369
So you feel very comfortable with putting very good hands.

14:29.850 --> 14:31.153
And I would agree with Shelby.

14:31.173 --> 14:35.661
I don't think that this material is, it's not impossibly scarce.

14:36.903 --> 14:38.766
I've never, I've never

14:39.488 --> 14:45.318
at any sort of period of time when there hasn't been more available than I can possibly afford to buy.

14:46.079 --> 14:47.762
And I don't really see that changing.

14:47.782 --> 14:58.099
I think the only area that really is becoming very difficult now is fine 16th century continental ornament, even more so than architectural books.

14:58.119 --> 15:01.986
And that's really because so much of this has gotten in the hands of the print dealers.

15:01.966 --> 15:20.155
And I hope there are no print dealers here, but they are the absolute antagonist of book collectors because when you start selling things by the page and pricing them like old by the sheet and pricing them like old master prints, you completely lose the frame of reference that most book collectors are constantly dealing in.

15:20.175 --> 15:25.644
But there's at least one very important collection in this field that will come onto the market in the next five years.

15:25.804 --> 15:28.969
So there will be opportunities to fill any gaps in that area.

15:29.388 --> 15:37.988
The institution's role, I mean, I think in the case of Winter Tour, has been, as I said, being exemplary, and I think it's a model for what you would want to do.

15:38.008 --> 15:44.644
I mean, you know, I had, even as a non-employee, I had access to the stack on a control base.

15:44.664 --> 15:46.047
There was mentorship, there were

15:46.432 --> 15:49.437
librarians who were collectors themselves.

15:49.457 --> 16:06.583
They made introductions to me as a very young person with really no money to some of the prominent dealers on the continent and in England and in the United States, which enabled me to jumpstart my own activities probably by about 10 years.

16:07.087 --> 16:32.571
The emphasized bibliography, I mean, no one gave me a set of standard bibliographies in my field, but I was told early on that I needed the Burlady catalog, I needed the full sale, I needed two or three other important catalogs, which I bought, and it's amazing what you can learn by reading bibliographies, and that's an interest that I've picked up in only in the last four or five years.

16:32.838 --> 16:58.153
I think these models can work, and I've had some other relationships, the Press Library at Harvard's own involving one, and certainly the Houghton Library has been very rewarding in certain contexts, but I think the Winter Tour one is unique in my experience, but I think it's a model that particularly the smaller and highly focused library can probably develop, and I think it pays to cultivate

16:58.133 --> 17:03.279
sort of identify your targets if you are a librarian, identify your candidates early on.

17:03.319 --> 17:08.646
And I actually, the first time I met Bill Reese was in the fall of 1971.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.589
And Bill didn't even have a driver's license.

17:11.609 --> 17:16.195
And then he was a very nice parent and very nice sister.

17:16.255 --> 17:23.904
And Bill was looking at the Audubon and the rest is history.

17:23.964 --> 17:27.128
So thank you all for the chance.

17:28.880 --> 17:53.389
Well, one of the reasons that I enjoy coming to programs like this is that it reminds one of the reasons that librarians do what they do and gives someone like myself a few moments to reflect back on how I feel about what we do and how we contribute to scholarships.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.233
On the wall outside my office, I have a

17:58.900 --> 18:04.768
list of the librarians at Brown University going back to the 1760s.

18:06.490 --> 18:11.477
One of whom I might add was a gentleman by the name of Increase Sumner Smith.

18:11.557 --> 18:15.042
That is an appropriate name for a librarian.

18:15.522 --> 18:16.383
I don't know what is.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.608
But I keep it there for two reasons.

18:20.148 --> 18:23.693
One, of course, is to remind people who come into the office that

18:24.027 --> 18:31.093
The position I hold is an old and distinguished one, and distinguished for good reason.

18:31.113 --> 18:33.716
That is because it's important to the institution.

18:33.736 --> 18:44.626
But also to remind myself that, and hopefully the folks who work in the library, that that library was there many years before we came.

18:45.387 --> 18:53.494
It's the product of the hard work, not only of our predecessors, but of the passion and the devotion of collectors

18:53.677 --> 19:04.955
such as we have here today, and we have it in our hands for really a fleeting moment in the history of that institution.

19:04.975 --> 19:17.676
And it's our role, and it's certainly, I feel, my role to try to pass it on to those who come after us, hopefully in better shape than where I found it.

19:18.128 --> 19:20.190
in every respect.

19:20.210 --> 19:24.094
And it's not simply a position, it's an inheritance.

19:24.114 --> 19:27.438
And it's something for us to lead through the future.

19:27.518 --> 19:45.537
And I think when you talk about the role of special collections and research libraries, I think one of the things that we have to offer to collectors and where there's a real connection is that kind of shared passion

19:45.770 --> 19:58.406
and commitment to the future of a vision that we're building on parents' paths and moving that forward for the generations long after us will benefit by it.

19:58.726 --> 20:07.798
It's a more lasting way of keeping someone's work alive, I think, often than a building.

20:08.418 --> 20:11.322
As someone who works often with donors,

20:11.723 --> 20:19.934
or hear stories about donors to the university, there's great excitement often about having your name on a building.

20:20.595 --> 20:36.195
But I think those of us who work in institutions and particularly old ones have also seen the buildings that are torn down or the buildings that change their name down the line.

20:36.648 --> 20:59.269
And for that reason, I think I often say an endowment for books is a much longer lasting memorial in some cases to someone, certainly a collection that is given to an institution and will be built upon and used for many future generations as a great living legacy.

21:00.630 --> 21:06.115
On my own role in all of this, I'm very honored to have Mark

21:06.398 --> 21:09.424
sort of adopt me as a member of the rare book community.

21:09.445 --> 21:17.582
This is a community with excessively high standards and the one which many library directors probably can't need.

21:18.123 --> 21:26.922
But I think my role more than anything else is to find the resources and provide support.

21:27.374 --> 21:39.213
So that the Special Collections people at Brown who have the knowledge of this field and the content expertise can go and do what they do and work with the donors.

21:40.114 --> 21:51.492
My goal is to help to reassure the donors that if a collection comes to our institution, it will be cherished and taken care of and preserved.

21:52.062 --> 22:10.969
And I think part of the role, and as mentioned earlier today, but perhaps not at great length, I think it's hard to underestimate the complexity today of the competition within institutions of higher education for funds.

22:11.229 --> 22:21.664
And I mean, not only for the library to get funds when you are looking, for example, at pressure to compete in financial aid,

22:22.133 --> 22:29.683
or at our institution providing support for graduate research, graduate fellowship.

22:29.703 --> 22:35.250
All of these things are things where the library is competing on institutional levels of resources.

22:35.270 --> 22:40.137
And then within the library, there is intense composition for the existing class.

22:40.157 --> 22:44.783
And I think one of the things the director is always in the position of balancing is

22:45.556 --> 22:53.264
how much of the available funds go to Special Collections versus the digital and versus other projects that are greatly cherished.

22:53.405 --> 23:13.707
So I always urge when I'm talking to audiences where there are many people from Special Collections to put the time in to educate the library director as much as you can because there's someone for whom there's a great deal of competition for the support.

23:14.243 --> 23:25.118
I want to agree with the comments that's been made by several people that I don't believe that the possibilities for collecting are drying up.

23:25.919 --> 23:27.301
Scholarship is voracious.

23:28.663 --> 23:41.161
It's moving into areas that when I was an undergraduate, no one would have believed that certain things would become for academic attention.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.065
But to give you an example,

23:44.467 --> 23:53.916
Not long ago, we were given a collection, and we're happy to be given a collection, of 60,000 comic books.

23:53.936 --> 24:09.010
Now, the thing that amazed me about this was the press this got, because the carrying on in the press was much along the lines of, Ivy League University Library collects comic books.

24:10.131 --> 24:12.393
What has the world come to?

24:12.413 --> 24:14.035
Or this is quite an external thing.

24:14.318 --> 24:24.109
Whereas I think we felt that comic books, aside from being an art form, are increasingly becoming important cultural studies.

24:24.129 --> 24:31.437
They're increasingly being produced as serious works of literature, although they're illustrated.

24:31.457 --> 24:40.167
And furthermore, and this is always an important issue for an academic institution, this collection fit in beautifully with other materials in our collection.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.110
So we didn't consider it to be odd at all.

24:43.715 --> 24:48.582
And neither is the gentleman who had built this fine collection and is still building it.

24:49.123 --> 24:57.556
So I think where there is a variety of human interest, there is always going to be a variety of collecting.

24:57.576 --> 25:07.191
And there's, at least I am not concerned about one day folks putting out things to collect and hopefully give to us.

25:07.998 --> 25:14.608
In 1982, my partner and I, Chuck Yushke and I, founded Adobe Systems.

25:14.749 --> 25:26.347
And when we founded Adobe, we had no concept that the company for the last 18 years would completely change the world of printing and publishing.

25:26.968 --> 25:32.757
Almost every magazine, newspaper, book in the world today of modern presses

25:33.040 --> 25:46.237
uses our technology, so our interest in the history of type and the interest of the history of printing has been always sort of part of the fabric of our professional life.

25:47.919 --> 25:51.544
How I got into collecting, this is a funny story.

25:52.365 --> 26:02.558
Our family was at the Grosvenor Housing and Teak Fair in 1987, and we were going back to buy the Nags food stall.

26:03.044 --> 26:06.670
And my son came up to me and he said, Dad, look at this.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.374
And there was this big book, and I pulled it off the shelf.

26:09.394 --> 26:15.745
And it was a 1570 copy of Euclid's Elements that was first edition in English.

26:16.486 --> 26:24.079
And if you open this book, it had these wonderful little pop-up figures of all the geometry of Euclid.

26:24.119 --> 26:28.005
While I studied at its philosophy in college,

26:28.711 --> 26:29.953
I said, oh my god.

26:30.554 --> 26:38.164
I really never had realized that such books even existed, much less that you could buy them.

26:38.184 --> 26:47.036
And so I looked at the price, and since Adobe had just gone public, I decided, well, this is nifty.

26:47.056 --> 26:49.780
I really have to have this book.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.242
So I took the book home.

26:51.222 --> 26:59.974
and put it up on the shelf, and that was a mistake because if you put it up on the shelf, there it is, all by itself.

27:00.755 --> 27:05.001
And you say to yourself, this book means friends.

27:05.061 --> 27:19.761
And that starts this ongoing and all-consuming disease that lasts over many, many years because you find more and more friends to add to the community of books.

27:20.382 --> 27:30.775
I would characterize my collection as a high point collection in science and mathematics and philosophy and economics.

27:30.795 --> 27:34.399
And there aren't many books, but they're good books.

27:35.120 --> 27:43.630
The other thing that occurred to me is when I started giving talks on these books, I used to take a couple of the books to go with the talks.

27:44.231 --> 27:49.157
We talked about books without the books are sort of boring.

27:49.593 --> 27:58.762
But when people see these first editions of Newton and Galileo, all of this emotion comes out of it.

27:58.782 --> 28:07.610
I mean, my God, these are real seminal events in the history of mankind.

28:07.630 --> 28:16.478
And so then I thought to myself, gee, wouldn't it be great if every high school kid could have access to all of this stuff?

28:17.453 --> 28:21.118
and yet at the same time not destroy them in the process.

28:21.138 --> 28:38.179
And so I mowed this around with a friend at work, and we decided to start Octavo with the express purpose of using the technology to photograph every page of the book and put them in electronic form and make them available in a very unknown price.

28:38.885 --> 28:50.516
And so the disposition of my collection, the best disposition would be if all of my collection was available to everybody for a very nominal price.

28:51.197 --> 28:57.603
The artifacts, as I completely agree with Bill Ries, they're icons.

28:57.763 --> 29:04.470
There will be nothing like holding one of these things in your hand and knowing that you've got a piece of history.

29:05.075 --> 29:07.100
But not everybody can do that.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.871
And even special collections and libraries can't do that because they can't let everybody in.

29:13.856 --> 29:15.540
It destroys the book over time.

29:16.077 --> 29:35.706
But we're working very closely with the Folger Museum and the Library of Congress and Mark and Daniel have been great supporters and Richard from the Folger have been great supporters of trying to get these things in individual forms so that everybody can look at the type, look at the paper texture,

29:36.226 --> 29:38.089
and get to look and feel with the folks.

29:38.109 --> 29:44.158
Because I think the final outcome should be, all of these things should be made ultimately accessible.

29:44.439 --> 29:46.722
So that's my goal of life.

29:47.023 --> 29:50.228
And that's what the collection is all about.

29:50.248 --> 29:50.889
Thanks very much.

29:51.550 --> 29:55.876
Let's try getting to the, I think, the common thread of this morning.

29:56.317 --> 29:58.360
We've heard it in a variety of ways.

29:58.380 --> 30:03.448
I know it's certainly the topic that a lot of people are talking about after this morning.

30:04.913 --> 30:18.791
Is it fair to say that when we look at collectors and librarians and the dealers who are often either the agents between us or for us, that we're at odds with each other?

30:18.832 --> 30:31.208
This morning we heard various phrases that either suggested that collectors are no longer collecting what libraries need, that there are consistently mentioned or issues of trust,

30:32.048 --> 30:40.592
a sense of security for the part of the collector, a sense of fear that their books would be abandoned.

30:41.835 --> 30:48.032
We heard about the magnetic force of gifts to libraries and what they can do.

30:49.548 --> 30:54.756
It's understood that we all share a spirit or a passion for book materials.

30:54.977 --> 30:58.843
We've all been striving for the word today, Hindi, I think works pretty well.

31:00.786 --> 31:11.944
But beyond that, are we at a point where collectors and librarians are describing a different passion?

31:12.869 --> 31:22.901
It was suggested this morning that there's a difference between caretaking and stewardship, and is this the point in which collectors and librarians differ?

31:23.281 --> 31:32.252
This comes from the spirit, certainly, of the librarian in which we would like collections to come to us, however that, whatever path that might be.

31:33.573 --> 31:36.717
So, I'll throw that out and see if people have some response to it.

31:38.198 --> 31:43.386
I guess, again, one speaks from one's experience.

31:44.708 --> 31:49.837
It's been a pretty symbiotic and fairly happy trinity for me.

31:52.321 --> 31:57.429
Again, as I said, I know where my books are going, and I'm not trying to make converts.

31:57.529 --> 32:03.278
I'm trying to help build a collection or two that's already existing.

32:03.460 --> 32:08.257
highly regarded in an area that is complementary to one that I am in.

32:08.277 --> 32:12.171
And frankly, I think there's quite a bit that can be learned in terms of

32:12.573 --> 32:17.362
libraries are cutting edge in terms of curatorial services and conservation.

32:17.382 --> 32:21.489
And there's probably more I could benefit from in that regard.

32:21.509 --> 32:29.643
And certainly the booksellers are, I agree with people who said that the booksellers are really the lubrication for a lot of what we do.

32:29.784 --> 32:34.051
I don't know many other collectors in my field, and there may be some.

32:34.071 --> 32:36.235
I'm sure there are a few of them around.

32:36.502 --> 32:42.469
But dealers are really the ultimate of open-stacked libraries.

32:42.970 --> 32:44.251
I mean, everything is for sale.

32:44.371 --> 32:46.654
Almost everything is for sale.

32:47.074 --> 32:50.098
And they let you come in, and they let you hold things.

32:50.118 --> 32:55.424
And books are very tactile, particularly if you're interested in illustrated books and buying things, as I am.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.207
So that works pretty well.

32:58.328 --> 33:00.450
And some libraries, I think,

33:00.700 --> 33:12.699
Some libraries, particularly large ones, do continue to be intimidating to someone on the outside and it takes a lot of time to penetrate physically into the libraries.

33:13.941 --> 33:21.173
That's one area where I think the book trade is probably more accessible and frankly

33:21.794 --> 33:49.253
know if if a dealer handled 50 copies of a book and charlie would probably seen 100 copies of most of the books that i would consider important in english architecture in the 17th 18th 19th century that that knowledge is you can't duplicate that as an individual so that's that's a great value i think to anyone who's collecting in a focused area but generally for me it's worked well so i had no no

33:49.756 --> 33:54.442
I think that the dealer and collector relationship is essential.

33:57.166 --> 34:01.192
You build a strong bond of trust to the dealer.

34:01.692 --> 34:06.479
They know your taste and what kind of books you'll consider and what kind of books you won't consider.

34:08.922 --> 34:16.152
For the most part, and you find out about the other ones, for the most part they're very, very ethical.

34:16.958 --> 34:21.743
I've run across a couple that aren't, but that's rare, I think.

34:22.584 --> 34:30.313
They have incredible knowledge, as you say, to seeing dozens of copies of books, and they try to represent the books fairly.

34:30.393 --> 34:40.624
So I've used probably a dozen readers all over the world that I trust with, and they are the source.

34:40.845 --> 34:46.611
I mean, they are the ones who rooted out auction houses lessons.

34:50.118 --> 35:05.022
My own personal contact tends to be more with collectors than it does with dealers, but I would say that in the institutions I've worked in,

35:05.508 --> 35:11.958
the relationship between libraries, dealers, and collectors has been overwhelmingly positive.

35:12.198 --> 35:17.726
And dealers have been very helpful to the library in a number of ways.

35:18.487 --> 35:33.490
And certainly, we at Brown have a number of long-term and very interested and involved collectors with whom we work.

35:33.757 --> 35:39.587
Sometimes there can be frustrations on both sides.

35:40.389 --> 35:47.441
I read an article some years ago, and I'm ashamed to say I cannot remember the author at this point, but essentially it was called bereavement and the collector.

35:48.262 --> 35:56.136
And it made the analogy that when a collector makes a decision to sell or give a collection to an institution,

35:56.116 --> 36:05.973
The collector often goes through the same stages of grief as you do when you lose someone who's very dear to you.

36:05.993 --> 36:07.676
You have anger, grief, denial.

36:07.896 --> 36:11.142
I don't remember all those things.

36:11.322 --> 36:16.150
I think perhaps the more appropriate analogy is giving away your child in marriage.

36:16.832 --> 36:19.997
You still have a decent investment.

36:19.977 --> 36:28.369
this entity would not exist, it hasn't been for your position and hard work, but now you've got to sort of let go and let .

36:29.611 --> 36:34.898
And I think it's important, communication is a very important part of it.

36:35.279 --> 36:44.652
It's very important for institutions to make sure that the collector knows from the beginning that the institution may not have

36:45.442 --> 36:50.970
exactly the same aims for that collection as the collector did.

36:50.990 --> 37:07.855
In other words, if your collection is going to the institution of higher education, there's an interest in that institution in having a collection of scholarship and that the collection relates to materials you already have.

37:08.088 --> 37:16.984
You may not develop the collection in the exact same way that the collector would have and he or she kept it under this control.

37:17.946 --> 37:26.181
The more these things are discussed openly and comfortably, then I think the less you understand the frustration you have down the line.

37:26.600 --> 37:46.465
The other thing I often think collectors may experience for the first time in working with an institution who has assigned their collection is the awesome ability to drive both parties to deal crazy.

37:46.765 --> 37:57.157
From the point of view of the library, as I often tell our staff, the library does not exist alone as part of a larger bureaucracy.

37:57.177 --> 38:13.175
It means that such issues as getting checks cut or getting papers signed in a seamless and smooth way that you might have with a transaction between two individuals.

38:13.395 --> 38:15.878
We do the best we can to

38:16.246 --> 38:24.714
make this easy for the collectors and the donors, but there are some types of pitches along the way.

38:28.077 --> 38:33.362
In a general sense, I think of dealers as being colleagues of mine.

38:33.382 --> 38:36.605
I'm not sure all dealers feel that same way about auction houses.

38:36.865 --> 38:44.532
But I certainly think that dealers play a greater role in nurturing private collectors.

38:45.001 --> 38:46.543
than an auction house can.

38:48.906 --> 38:53.933
By the nature of our business, we're much more concerned, frankly, with sellers than with buyers.

38:54.394 --> 39:02.405
We figure if we have something like a receiver in the library to sell, the buyers are going to come to it.

39:02.425 --> 39:06.030
So it's hard for us sometimes to get to know collectors

39:06.314 --> 39:23.614
in the same way as dealers do i think still this sense of intimidation about attending an auction i think occasionally dealers like to play up that presumption to keep private bidders out of the rooms

39:23.797 --> 39:40.945
but more and more we're seeing private collectors participate on their own sometimes on the telephone so perhaps the demon doesn't know that they're doing something on their own rather than being in the room but

39:41.617 --> 39:46.963
We play a role by bringing many books to the marketplace.

39:46.984 --> 39:54.533
Just as dealers have stocks, it can be viewed at an exhibition at an auction house as an opportunity for people to see unbearable books.

39:55.133 --> 40:00.560
The Siebert sale was really the first time those books had ever been seen by anyone in their entirety.

40:04.765 --> 40:07.168
By anyone other than Dr. Siebert himself.

40:14.219 --> 40:21.790
with the assumption that collections lead a life that ultimately end up in a library.

40:23.052 --> 40:28.580
I know that may not be universally shared in the room, but let's start with that assumption.

40:28.600 --> 40:35.470
What is it that librarians and dealers and collectors need to do to make them happen?

40:37.292 --> 40:40.497
Or what is it that we're not doing that prevents that from happening?

40:43.430 --> 40:54.943
I think, to some extent, libraries have to stop acting like they have to divide right.

40:54.963 --> 40:57.169
Collectors work hard to get the books that

40:58.246 --> 41:24.523
that they have they have a great deal invested in them not simply monetary they're proud of them and you know it's become a cliche to say you want other collectors to have a chance but in fact a very important collector just last week was saying to me if other people hadn't sold their books where would i have gotten my books and my books have been beside my family the principal pleasure of my life

41:24.824 --> 41:35.779
So I think perhaps, you know, working on this sense of cooperation... Well, I...

41:37.666 --> 41:43.275
How many entries, new entries, does the Library of Congress get per day?

41:45.117 --> 41:45.378
30,000?

41:45.578 --> 41:47.741
We're going to be on the copyright office.

41:47.962 --> 41:51.708
Yes, right.

41:52.108 --> 42:00.501
So, and I've made this point before, and I think some of you may have heard of the Library of Congress.

42:00.717 --> 42:28.328
and i recall going in cardinals coming out i think the basic fear that i would have as a collector and i think any collector would have is that this thing collection is going to go in and die on the shelves and that was brought up earlier that this is a major fear that somehow this thing is going to get lost and never

42:29.270 --> 42:31.973
you have the access to the collection that you would like.

42:33.675 --> 42:35.457
So I think it's a major question.

42:35.557 --> 42:37.679
I would ask you to see what you're going to do with it.

42:38.620 --> 42:49.432
And what positively are you going to do with it to make either the materials accessible or bring the same joy to whoever went this season that I got out of it.

42:50.654 --> 42:58.062
Could you expand on that in the sense that certainly from a librarian's perspective, one would say the opportunity for many more people

42:58.295 --> 43:27.627
to discover this book would be present at the library as opposed to the private residence of a collector so could you talk a little bit more about what it would what you would need to hear from a library that would make you comfortable or assured that well it's sort of the same quandary that i had when i started the collection i felt this pain that i own these things that really should have much much broader appeal and so i sort of took it in my own hands to try to make them accessible independently

43:27.893 --> 43:33.500
And I guess what I would like is the same kind of assurance that that kind of energy would be put into it, that I would put into it.

43:34.141 --> 43:39.648
That's from a purely personal point of view.

43:40.690 --> 43:48.400
I think this has been very much what I was saying before about two things that are struggling today in the conversation.

43:48.616 --> 44:11.410
Bob Jackson's point about the need for libraries to reach out to collectors who may not know that we have an interest in what they're doing, particularly, again, if they're collecting in areas that they may not see as some serious scholarship or a serious interest in higher education.

44:11.910 --> 44:17.138
But having the words done that, then I think having a discussion about why

44:17.692 --> 44:30.705
you believe the collection belongs to the institution, what you will do with it, how you will, and I know this is not a popular word in our community, but I'll use it anyway, market the collection so that

44:30.888 --> 44:32.591
There's a wide knowledge.

44:32.831 --> 44:59.190
One of the things I think that has made a great difference in the use of special collections over the last 20 years has been the retrospective cataloging projects where there was a time when in order to use certain collections, someone had to know that this particular collection was at X University and covered a certain subject or period.

44:59.170 --> 45:09.737
And even then, you couldn't count on the fact that the person who wanted to use it would know the types of materials were in that collection.

45:09.937 --> 45:26.361
Now that many of these collections have been cataloged, what we're finding is people are coming upon a particular title that is an interest to them and they want to come and use and work with.

45:26.381 --> 45:33.972
And they have no idea in the world that it was part of the Annex P. Brown military collection or part of a collection that was formed that was an interest in a particular subject.

45:33.992 --> 45:36.315
They may not even be working in that particular subject area.

45:36.295 --> 45:58.419
There's a good deal that libraries are doing now through these digitalization projects that is making materials available on the internet, but not with the idea that that use is going to replace or support the importance of the artifact, but that it will in fact bring people to the library to use those artifacts.

45:58.439 --> 46:03.484
I think the worst thing a library can do in a sense

46:03.751 --> 46:25.336
would be to accept the collection simply because of an iconic value and without any idea of why it fit into that institution, collecting the gold book house, the port of the mission, and simply salt it away on the shelves because it was nice to have.

46:25.536 --> 46:31.783
And that indeed may have gone on in some places in the past, but I don't think it's today's vision of their book librarianship.

46:32.050 --> 46:48.479
One thing I would add to that is that I came into the profession via the public services route, and I spent my first six or seven years on a circulation desk, which I occasionally refer to as the Russian front of the library.

46:48.499 --> 46:51.865
There's no way a glamorous part of the exhibition.

46:52.250 --> 47:08.883
And when I entered the profession, I think there was a view amongst some of those special collections people sat over in their ivory towers, exclaiming over their bindings and doing the best they could to keep everyone else from using the book.

47:08.903 --> 47:11.608
And one of the things that I have...

47:12.044 --> 47:41.511
pleasure of learning through the involvement i've had with the special license community that is far far from the case in this generation and probably one of the former generation either well i think if we can get over the hurdle of finding a library that is the right home and will take care of things and use them and promote them properly i think there's still a lot that libraries can do to tolerate donors and

47:42.115 --> 47:48.484
Part of it is just kind of looking to your extended family or your museum.

47:49.005 --> 47:53.612
You look to the people who use your collection, maybe who visit you.

47:54.974 --> 47:59.601
If you want to collect books on furniture, the worst place to start might be

47:59.800 --> 48:05.269
It wouldn't be the worst place to start to get to know some people who are in the manufacturing furniture business.

48:05.289 --> 48:12.120
If you want to collect books on builders hardware, find someone that's in the hybrid builders hardware business.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.604
You'd be surprised what kind of archives still exist.

48:15.385 --> 48:18.450
They are disappearing, but they still exist.

48:18.531 --> 48:20.053
Just to use two examples.

48:20.472 --> 48:25.782
I think at the university level, particularly the smaller libraries, can be fairly creative.

48:25.802 --> 48:38.886
I mean, when I was at Harvard Business School, Ken Carpenter, who was then the press librarian, did absolute wonders in terms of the PR of the press by having cool collector's groups.

48:39.203 --> 48:44.711
such things that seem, you know, inconsequential as distributing out a scope catalog.

48:44.911 --> 48:56.368
I mean, I can't tell you how many wonderful color plate catalogs I got from Freddie Schaub and all these William Schaub and all these fancy European dealers that there was no way I was going to be on their list.

48:56.348 --> 49:02.294
They're in a little back closet of a pile that never diminished through week to week, month to month.

49:02.675 --> 49:05.838
Anyone who wanted them can have them as a reference material.

49:05.858 --> 49:08.561
People don't forget those kind of things.

49:08.581 --> 49:10.283
So those are very simple things.

49:10.303 --> 49:14.628
But I think it's like selling any other kind of service or product.

49:14.708 --> 49:17.551
And here it's a very commendable thing.

49:17.651 --> 49:21.495
Everyone should wear their marketing hat.

49:21.515 --> 49:25.680
So if we can take it as understood that there is more to the relationship

49:26.470 --> 49:33.898
between collectors and libraries, and as Bob pointed out this morning, the simple transfer of material.

49:35.279 --> 49:42.366
Can we talk a bit more about what kind of relationship we should be developing, regardless of where those collections end up?

49:42.907 --> 49:56.140
And certainly those of us who deal in rare books, who have public service operations, know full well that collectors often are users, that we learn as much from our collections from them as they do from us.

49:56.423 --> 50:00.808
that there is in fact a community of books that are formed.

50:01.889 --> 50:16.045
But I'm interested in hearing people talk about what it is that we could do as librarians, or conversely as collectors or dealers, to bring this community tighter together to focus on our interest collecting in general.

50:16.065 --> 50:23.713
One thing that I think about is really from the perspective of the library, I think there are three areas

50:24.166 --> 50:26.389
are very important to collectors.

50:27.130 --> 50:31.596
One is curatorial and conservation services.

50:31.956 --> 50:34.480
Clearly another is publication.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.903
And a third area is deposit or storage.

50:36.983 --> 50:39.867
Now, no one has any space anymore.

50:39.987 --> 50:43.592
But those are, I think, the three desires of every collector who

50:43.876 --> 50:54.122
doesn't probably have a curator, lives in New York, where it comes in, doesn't have a perfect environment, runs out of space, and on and on and on.

50:54.142 --> 51:00.518
So there may be, in certain cases, very symbiotic kind of relationship to develop.

51:01.493 --> 51:24.717
I think the people that I've seen build very personal relationships with collectors, that is the librarians, often it's building a real sense of collegiality and friendship in the sense that there's frequent contact, there's comfort on both sides with

51:24.697 --> 51:32.607
touching base sometimes if someone has a question or a problem or wants to know what to do about a preservation problem.

51:33.368 --> 51:45.523
We have one of our donors at the library who lives in the community and who is in and out constantly just on a friendly basis.

51:45.664 --> 51:51.531
And sometimes we help her with one problem or another.

51:51.747 --> 52:10.178
and uh i think having that kind of easy open relationship um where perhaps someone someone mentioned earlier this morning of culture building a collection with an awareness that it may come to the library and building it with the knowledge of what the library has

52:10.597 --> 52:29.736
other thing that struck me is a wonderful idea and i don't recall the point who mentioned the the need for mentoring and for bringing collectors together the cultures are often looking for um people to talk to similar and i think that's something that perhaps

52:29.716 --> 52:32.881
libraries don't do as much as they should.

52:32.901 --> 52:34.263
And we have friends groups.

52:34.764 --> 52:37.188
The friends groups really don't play that role.

52:38.049 --> 52:56.938
And I'm thinking of something that would be much more, oh, I don't know, where people could actually sort of get together in circles and talk about their issues with collectors and perhaps, you know, some experts help curators if they were starting out, that kind of thing.

52:56.918 --> 53:06.625
I think the analogy that you're giving up a member of your family when you give up the collection, you sort of really want to get to know

53:07.280 --> 53:08.942
who you're giving up your kids to.

53:11.324 --> 53:31.205
You know, and quite frankly over the last couple of years, the relationship that we've developed with Mark, the relationship that I've developed with the culture, they're seeming a lot more like family than they are, you know, strangers who are going to take your kids' improve license.

53:32.326 --> 53:36.510
The other thing I would comment just related to that is that

53:36.777 --> 54:04.084
i when i was a fledgling young thing and was an intern at yale um i followed the library director rogers to a um a very important uh conference that was held here at the library of congress to talk about what we should do about the national preservation problem and this was i think about 1975-76 and there was a great deal of um

54:04.334 --> 54:12.932
almost despair at that point because it seemed like such an immense problem and something that how will we ever going to deal with it.

54:13.093 --> 54:20.368
And it was really the leadership of the Library of Congress and the kind of catalyst role in play that got these

54:20.686 --> 54:48.685
national cooperative preservation efforts together and also I think really focus the attention of the research library community on the preservation issue and as a consequence of that I think the dollars spent on preservation and conservation of materials has increased I'm happy to say Brown is not one of the libraries that story things in the process Michael Selman but

54:49.508 --> 54:57.599
We just finished through an NIH challenge grant, raising over $3 million from preservation.

54:58.420 --> 55:09.334
And there's a real commitment, I think, in most research libraries these days, to seeing that your children will not be utilized in our care.

55:09.354 --> 55:11.517
And there's a great sensitivity to that.

55:12.256 --> 55:20.407
I hadn't thought of storage, but my first thought was the other two points that Ed raised.

55:20.427 --> 55:31.041
I really think exhibitions and catalogs are the two things that the three groups have most in common and take most enjoyment out of it.

55:31.021 --> 55:48.994
Like the Royer Club, Eric Holzenberg is ready to revitalize their exhibition program that has gotten great press coverage and you suddenly feel that you aren't necessarily second fiddle to whatever art exhibition is up, that books are important and you can see is there a book there that you have?

55:49.074 --> 55:51.038
Maybe next time you're going to loan to the book.

55:51.018 --> 56:08.250
then there's a catalog of publications that gets into the trade and you start to cite it i think within about three months of bill's 19th century color plate book coming out we were citing it for the second fever sale as reference so that to me seems to be something that

56:08.230 --> 56:13.961
Really, I realize that a lot of libraries do it, that more emphasis should be done on it.

56:13.981 --> 56:15.423
It's a very public profile.

56:16.445 --> 56:21.274
It makes everyone involved feel as though something tangible has been accomplished, which it has been.

56:22.136 --> 56:26.003
And it adds real importance to what's going on.

56:25.983 --> 56:29.588
I'm a little curious about the idea of getting collectors together.

56:29.668 --> 56:31.470
I really wonder if that's a good idea.

56:31.490 --> 56:37.238
I think dealers are often a pain to keep collectors apart.

56:37.398 --> 56:42.005
They work very hard to keep collectors apart.

56:42.065 --> 56:45.269
Maybe librarians should do that as well.

56:45.649 --> 56:48.754
I think many collectors are very private.

56:49.194 --> 56:52.519
They feel rivalries with someone else.

56:53.139 --> 56:55.062
So I'm not sure that

56:55.683 --> 57:01.845
getting together a group would be as effective as just trying to work one on one.

57:03.361 --> 57:04.983
Depends on what she talks about.

57:05.084 --> 57:10.472
Perhaps she could bring together people collected in different areas.

57:10.492 --> 57:15.640
You know, you wouldn't bring all of the Shaw collectors together in one place.

57:15.660 --> 57:21.068
When you do that, each person wants to talk about his or her collection.

57:21.088 --> 57:24.353
It's the rarest, like a parallel line that never enters back.

57:24.373 --> 57:29.841
Well, if we ever tried it, I'll deport that.

57:30.395 --> 57:35.423
As far as shot collectors, this is completely off the track.

57:35.483 --> 57:50.125
Talking about the scarcity of material we had to sale a few years ago from an old man in Dayton, Ohio, who collected a long time with most of his dealers.

57:50.543 --> 57:53.412
Pre-deceased him, no one knew much about the collection.

57:53.452 --> 57:57.645
It was actually, for this sort of forum, an ideal situation.

57:57.685 --> 58:01.397
The library was sold, but it was sold for the benefit of Margaret College.

58:01.512 --> 58:28.279
so everyone benefited that we chose as the front of the piece with his letterman inscribed copy of man and superman in which shaw wrote something like you will drive me mad with your craze for first editions take up a more useful hobby fight suicide

58:29.086 --> 58:31.333
It took that challenge.

58:31.353 --> 58:39.257
This may be an appropriate time to open up the panel to questions from the floor.

58:39.297 --> 58:43.129
Rather than doing the traditional mic standing in the middle

58:43.362 --> 58:49.795
the aisle with so many people who opted for more of a television style where the microphone will be handed to you.

58:49.915 --> 58:55.386
So we will have roving individuals with microphones who will try and contact.

58:55.406 --> 58:57.089
And I see a hand right over here.

58:57.210 --> 58:57.911
We have a mic.

58:58.552 --> 59:01.458
Is that George?

59:02.320 --> 59:02.400
Yes.

59:03.173 --> 59:07.923
And would you please identify yourself and give us some clue as to who you might be.

59:08.264 --> 59:11.911
I'm George Lowry, Chairman of the Swan Galleries.

59:11.931 --> 59:16.120
My question is, we've been talking about world-class collections.

59:16.370 --> 59:20.496
A lot of people who are collectors are collectors who are not world class collectors.

59:20.916 --> 59:23.520
What does the library, how the dealers deal with?

59:24.000 --> 59:28.246
People who are not spending $500,000 a year, $500,000 a year for collection.

59:28.266 --> 59:34.074
But at the end of 20 years, I've got a perfectly acceptable, interesting collection.

59:35.316 --> 59:40.422
But libraries are inundated with people who've got perfectly respectable, interesting collections.

59:40.442 --> 59:41.584
How do they handle those?

59:41.935 --> 59:48.405
George, just before you give that mic away, would you define this as questions that wouldn't fall in the auction market at all?

59:48.805 --> 59:49.266
Well, no.

59:49.426 --> 59:51.329
No, it's not a question of the auction market.

59:51.369 --> 59:52.291
It's simply a question.

59:52.311 --> 59:56.777
We're talking about the relationship between dealers and libraries and collectors.

59:57.478 --> 01:00:08.635
As I say, my concern, and the people that we deal with most of the time, people who do not have world-class, they may have a world-class work, but it's in with much of a very interesting,

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:10.479
books on a particular subject.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:23.172
And you might go to Harvard, you might go to Brown, you might go to Columbia, and they say, it's a very nice collection, but these are all books that we already have.

01:00:23.192 --> 01:00:24.093
Now what?

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:33.563
Well, I'm very conscious of the fact that my head of special collections is here, and I'm afraid that all kinds are going to wrap me up by the head if I don't say the right thing.

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:36.006
So far, it should be OK.

01:00:36.155 --> 01:00:40.440
I think it's a hard question to answer in general.

01:00:41.461 --> 01:00:45.726
I think in our case, indeed, we would look at what we already had.

01:00:46.446 --> 01:00:57.178
We have certainly been known to recommend someone to go on to another institution which might find the collection very valuable.

01:00:57.198 --> 01:01:03.445
If it's something that is not, quote, a world class collection, but nonetheless,

01:01:03.644 --> 01:01:17.166
fit within our collecting scope, met a need, either in the curriculum on campus or to support research and fit in with what we do, we would probably welcome it.

01:01:17.186 --> 01:01:22.614
I mean, we're not only interested in world-class collections.

01:01:22.734 --> 01:01:26.260
But small collectors require just a look at this.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.704
I beg your pardon?

01:01:29.944 --> 01:01:33.689
Well, collectors require this remiss massaging, and our collectors are large.

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:42.479
Yes, but you know, sometimes they're worth it, because sometimes a small collection, I love the phrase, is this collection as magnet for other collections?

01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:43.340
You never know.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:51.589
I mean, one of the things, and one of the reasons that question is hard to answer in the abstract is, whose collection is this?

01:01:51.772 --> 01:02:08.960
Is it a member of the university corporation and a major donor who has a collection that does fit within the scope, but you're interested in things beyond simply that immediate, yet you're interested in a long relationship?

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.063
There's a lot of factors that come into it.

01:02:12.545 --> 01:02:20.558
If I can just say something that's been on my mind, but George's question really makes me want to get off the tip of my tongue.

01:02:20.578 --> 01:02:25.266
We've been talking about special collections today, and this exists in a vacuum.

01:02:25.967 --> 01:02:38.147
And I think certainly Merrilee and I and most of the colleagues who are here today would agree that special collections at an academic institution and

01:02:38.498 --> 01:02:43.004
rare books and special collections at the Library of Congress is part of a larger whole.

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:56.423
So that when I say something about within scope, I'm looking at the rare books and materials in special collections really against how they, you know, support that

01:02:57.382 --> 01:03:05.610
real deep foundation of scholarly sources that constitutes the six million volumes in the University of Chicago Library.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:17.061
So one way of looking at George's question is, well, yes, but maybe, and I take your small collection, large collection, not to be numbers, but sort of price point.

01:03:17.321 --> 01:03:23.207
And that might be a very valuable collection for the circulating collections.

01:03:23.227 --> 01:03:26.730
Or that collection might contain copies of books

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:36.161
that could upgrade, replace, or provide complete copies of books that have gone missing or been used to death in our stack.

01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:41.667
So I'd just like to sort of say that we need to think a bit more broadly when we're talking about collectors and libraries.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:48.735
I'd like to add to that too, if I could, because I think this is an interesting question that many of us face.

01:03:49.171 --> 01:04:06.108
The reactions almost go contrary to the size of the institution, that is larger, more formalized, or more established special collections within large university libraries, if they own those high spots, have greater difficulty with the selected high spot collection.

01:04:06.748 --> 01:04:18.840
If the donor is not interested in allowing duplicates to move or want separate storage, a variety of considerations that sometimes come with these collections,

01:04:19.124 --> 01:04:45.148
Whereas large articulated collections may be very much in need of the next rubber material, the secondary material, the support material, the minor authors, the less expensive pieces, the examples of fine print findings, the things that may have been unfortunately processed in the past but now we see as real objects where we do in fact need pristine copies to bring into special collections.

01:04:45.753 --> 01:05:06.180
So while it might be tempting to say large institutions want large collections or big book collections, it may very well be that those are appropriate for the smaller institutions who lack them and could get much more mileage out of a copy of the Nuremberg Chronicle than an institution that already has both the German and the Latin edition.

01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:11.828
Whereas large institutions may have a need for a broader, deeper base of material

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.365
I think that, could you identify yourself here?

01:05:20.385 --> 01:05:22.387
My name is William Berkman.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:26.652
I think that everyone touches on the word passion.

01:05:27.713 --> 01:05:33.039
But then when we hear your animal is caught, no one approaches the subject.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:40.547
And I think the fact is that America isn't a world of a range of marriages now.

01:05:40.567 --> 01:05:44.211
America is a world of passion, concern, emotion,

01:05:44.883 --> 01:05:55.276
And I think part of the difference between collectors and all of the other participants is that meeting of the fashion company.

01:05:55.296 --> 01:06:14.721
The fact is the very best booksellers, auctioneers, and librarians have that passion, but oftentimes the institutions they represent seem to lack that passion and cause collectors to be concerned

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:23.812
Not that the relationship with individuals isn't good, but will that institution maintain it?

01:06:24.833 --> 01:06:33.262
And when Mr. Lincoln talked about the Winter Museum, that long relationship gave him confidence to develop that passion.

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:36.845
It's hard without that kind of relationship to maintain it.

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:43.392
So part of the issue is how do you get that feeling, brother, that that passion is institutionalized?

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:49.163
Anyone has a panelist?

01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:52.147
I agree.

01:06:55.110 --> 01:07:01.138
We passionately agree.

01:07:01.158 --> 01:07:04.161
I think that's probably an offense as a part of the panel.

01:07:04.182 --> 01:07:10.369
And maybe we can explore that again in the afternoon after coffee break, because I think you are touching on something.

01:07:10.389 --> 01:07:11.050
I see a hand.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:12.091
There's a microphone.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.613
We do stand up when you get the microphone.

01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:16.737
You might as well turn on one of the Virginia Stores Society in Richmond.

01:07:17.071 --> 01:07:27.262
And touching on that point, institutions like ours that our collections were largely built through philanthropy, not through purchase, the most important asset they have is their trustworthiness.

01:07:28.123 --> 01:07:31.046
And I really think it's incumbent upon generation after generation.

01:07:31.066 --> 01:07:44.361
We were looking at the deaccessioning project one time, and the greatest bar that we had to deaccessioning some of these items that might otherwise have been wonderful candidates is that a promise had been made to somebody 50 years, 100 years hence, or before,

01:07:44.678 --> 01:07:47.982
saying that we would keep this in the collection forever.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:50.805
Now, we don't make that kind of promise lightly now.

01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:52.067
We're very careful about that.

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:53.849
But the promise has been made.

01:07:53.889 --> 01:08:08.627
And I think unless your institution is willing to live up to those promises, then you probably have no reason, no right to be in the business of accepting people's collections.

01:08:13.687 --> 01:08:15.829
Hi, I'm from Columbia.

01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:29.525
One of the ways that large institutions can respond is by looking for people whose collections are not necessarily valuable, but are on the cutting edge of what can be collected.

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:36.893
That is pursuing subject areas, for example, that no one thought of collecting before.

01:08:37.143 --> 01:08:50.686
marginalia, collecting certain assets of a particular printer, collecting subject areas or formats such as comic books that haven't entered into the high-end book market right now.

01:08:50.746 --> 01:09:02.425
Sometimes the younger readers, collectors, people virtually just out of college, have most insightful viewpoints on how to develop and maintain these collections.

01:09:02.692 --> 01:09:06.919
CD-ROMs are, of course, they have their preservation problems involved in the new format.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:21.882
But there's all kinds of ways in which creative collecting is going on and which institutions that may have a lot of high spots may, on the other hand, be only too excited about

01:09:22.216 --> 01:09:40.736
being able to receive collections of 19th century science books, for example, or early 20th century social science, collections that people have placed very little value on in the market today, but are extremely exciting and will be exciting in 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years from now.

01:09:40.756 --> 01:09:41.878
I would add that

01:09:42.702 --> 01:09:57.569
something to that, which I think may become the work of librarians, which is we have that possibility as well of creating interest in a topic that may be responding to our own academic programs or our constituency.

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:04.862
I'm thinking, for example, of the work Margaret Taylor is doing at NYU in which he's identified at Downtown School of Authors.

01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:18.870
who are living and very much alive, who are active in creating a center of interest for them at NYU Library, which has suddenly brought in a large wealth of material from either the individuals themselves or collectors around that area.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:24.741
There's an example of still cutting edge collecting, but creating a focus or a space.

01:10:25.362 --> 01:10:31.597
for people who share an interest in that topic, either as the creator, or the collector, or the audience for that.

01:10:31.617 --> 01:10:34.043
That I think would tie into a change.

01:10:34.784 --> 01:10:36.368
I would agree with that.

01:10:36.888 --> 01:11:01.596
has developed in a way that really came people off the phone sometimes saying it sounds like a wonderful collection but the value is really more scholarly or historical than commercial but after saying it often enough and thinking about the collections people are describing you start to realize oftentimes it's true just because something is insalable by Sotheby's and so on Bill Reese doesn't believe that

01:11:01.576 --> 01:11:11.914
It is not going to be of interest in trying to direct collections by that to institutions.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:22.993
Well, I was just going to comment, too, on the portion, which is certainly a very important element in collecting.

01:11:22.973 --> 01:11:27.498
It's also, I suppose you could say, passion.

01:11:27.518 --> 01:11:29.180
We continue to use marriage analogy.

01:11:29.841 --> 01:11:34.707
It's something that, you know, sometimes burns very hard at the beginning of a relationship.

01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:37.931
That's the strong, steady, loyal devotion.

01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:40.875
It's something that, you know, saves the course.

01:11:41.055 --> 01:11:45.420
And I think when... Passion!

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.208
Well, there you are.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:58.267
But I'm kind of looking at the office, you know, Martha's rattling off all the things you collect.

01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:01.975
And I imagine you're passionate about all of them.

01:12:02.343 --> 01:12:24.452
is it you know across the board passion all those things or is there one is there a more passionate battle than another or it's just like uh the star system that variable life but once you have a great once you have a marriage as a lifelong partner it should be a passion should increase not

01:12:24.432 --> 01:12:44.854
I think one of the arcs about all this on both sides is that, again, institutions like my own, certainly in the Library of Congress,

01:12:46.083 --> 01:13:16.005
we work with with each passionate collector and as a collective company they're joining what you might say is a great stream of collections put there by others who are passionate for them and i think the real art is to work with each director and each collector and respond to their great loss they have for their material and yet at the same time not

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:24.565
Have them understand that they may be one of several passionate people that the institution has relationships with.

01:13:24.585 --> 01:13:38.263
And you can't, it's a little different I think perhaps than the collectors who may be free to go every moment of this waking time to one area or group of areas.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:45.396
My name is Gordon Pfeiffer, I'm a collector.

01:13:45.917 --> 01:13:51.402
I think the panel is making a mistake when they say they should not bring collectors together.

01:13:51.523 --> 01:14:05.837
I mean obviously clubs are able to do that, but I think library also have a function of doing that, and it's not what gives you more pleasure than you find a competitor of mine when working with you, they might find something that he already has underneath the right person.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:11.907
And I guess what's fun finding out what EFA has as I would if I had it for myself.

01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:13.069
So you're making a mistake.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:17.957
Do you live anywhere near Providence?

01:14:18.117 --> 01:14:21.403
I live very near literature.

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:22.485
There's a mic over here.

01:14:22.885 --> 01:14:24.328
I was back there.

01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:25.670
Okay, stand up when you got the mic.

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:27.032
Is that Ben?

01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:28.213
Yeah, hi Mark.

01:14:28.614 --> 01:14:40.587
My name is Ben Kinmon and I just wanted to bring up one point which hasn't really been discussed so far, which is the way in which, in fact, collectors can also end libraries and can affect the historiography of a given field.

01:14:41.188 --> 01:14:49.577
And I particularly think about George Thompson in the 17th century in England and his famous collection of tracts and broadsides.

01:14:49.912 --> 01:15:04.692
and newspapers, which are now in the British Museum, and how the development of social history and other historians really couldn't have occurred without this collection sort of sitting there lately.

01:15:05.273 --> 01:15:10.941
And the British Library for three and a half centuries

01:15:11.545 --> 01:15:26.083
And I just wondered that one of the other things that I find very valuable about collectors and relationships with libraries, with these more esoteric or unusual subjects, is when the libraries are unable to issue a bibliography, a subject bibliography about a given field.

01:15:26.283 --> 01:15:39.460
And I wondered, and I think in terms of gastronomy, of course, with Cagle's productions at the Lilley Library, where we finally have some bibliographies that are not just short-listing productions by proper correlations for gastronomy.

01:15:40.165 --> 01:16:00.891
And I wondered whether or not, for the librarians in particular, whether or not they could talk about the difficulty or the reason why there simply aren't more subject to bibliographies being issued by the libraries, which would really be a serious and important contribution to the field when they bring in these collections.

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:11.156
If the Thompson catalogs hadn't been issued by the British Library in the 19th century or late 19th century, it wouldn't have been as useful and it wouldn't have affected his geography the way that it had.

01:16:11.176 --> 01:16:15.488
The Kegel catalogs are the same thing with the field of gastronomy.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:31.518
And I certainly often feel like when it's just wonderful, small, maybe not so valuable, but very focused collections to go to libraries, it would be wonderful if the bibliography would be properly written and really be a contribution to the field.

01:16:31.999 --> 01:16:34.945
And I wanted if somebody could speak about that.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:43.826
I think there are several reasons for that.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:59.953
One of the great questions I know about our staff, I think in Special Collections, is the demand today on a daily basis just to offer service, develop the collection,

01:17:00.338 --> 01:17:04.003
deal with the digital projects, raise money.

01:17:04.463 --> 01:17:20.563
We were talking a little earlier today about the fact that there are people now who are reluctant to become curators because of the expectation that you're going to have to raise money and they don't find that congenial and don't spend their time doing that.

01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:27.932
The time that is available in libraries for people to do scholarship

01:17:28.182 --> 01:17:58.122
has really become a problem um the other issue i think well there's two words is one is um where the next generation of verbal librarians are coming from this is this is an area where we really need scholars and people with content knowledge and it is a question as to whether people are going to enter the profession who have the kind of knowledge to do the scholarly bibliography that um were important

01:17:58.456 --> 01:18:13.192
And another factor I think is that many of these projects were supported by grant funding, some of it from places like NEH, others from private funds and from private foundations.

01:18:13.212 --> 01:18:17.056
And as I said earlier, that money has dried up.

01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:25.425
And so while you could argue that it's something that our institutions support,

01:18:25.692 --> 01:18:43.027
through the willingness to devote staff to that, in fact, is very difficult to keep the place running these days, much less pull someone off to devote that kind of time of doing it.

01:18:43.047 --> 01:18:44.310
Terry, do you have the mic?

01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.410
Yes.

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:45.479
It's an honor.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.100
Thank you.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.504
I'm Terry Ballinger from the University of Virginia.

01:18:49.265 --> 01:18:57.397
I attended my first wear book conference in 1974, and I realized there are many people in this room that if I play this game with, I'm going to lose.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.822
But I began being struck.

01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:07.292
I think it was the Harvard conference in the early 90s celebrating the 50th anniversary of the

01:19:07.559 --> 01:19:21.618
Hoden Library, at the extent to which there's an obligatory statement at the beginning of the conference that said, well, this is about to change, you know, because of the electronic arrangements, and then it wasn't discussed again for the rest of the day.

01:19:21.658 --> 01:19:35.136
And it seems to me that the topic that is before us more important than any other at a meeting like this at a time like this is what's going to happen over the next 25 years with all those books that no one wants.

01:19:35.858 --> 01:19:48.298
and that has been the stuff of our research libraries for a long time, but which will be thought to be unnecessary by a very large number of the libraries that are unhappy owners of them at the moment.
