WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:03.891
Sitting in the public garden.

00:03.911 --> 00:05.233
Does that look like a red light is running to you?

00:05.714 --> 00:07.437
My glasses, yes.

00:07.457 --> 00:10.683
Sitting in the public of Dr. Patrick McCabe on a gorgeous spring day.

00:12.286 --> 00:14.150
And tell me, tell me about this book.

00:14.430 --> 00:15.031
Tell me about it.

00:15.192 --> 00:24.148
Yeah, tell me what it is and how it follows the butcher boy and how you've managed to achieve so much extraordinary success at such a tender young age.

00:24.449 --> 00:24.990
How's that?

00:25.110 --> 00:27.413
Well, I can't answer that last bit because that's up to the public.

00:27.433 --> 00:31.219
You'll have to ask them because I only write the books and wait for what happens after that.

00:31.259 --> 00:45.019
As far as the dead school goes, one of the reviewers there recently described it as a mesmerizing tango of psychological ruin narrated by a demented mother goose, which has to be wild if nothing else.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.685
But basically what I always start with is music.

00:49.606 --> 00:51.148
I started with two songs in this book.

00:51.889 --> 00:52.811
One was called Makushla.

00:53.472 --> 00:53.612
Mm-hmm.

00:54.082 --> 01:19.228
means my beloved it's a very strange and almost sinister song about mortality and death the other one is uh curiously you um you know chirpy chirpy cheap cheap was the other one which also has a kind of a sinister aspect to it because totally irrelevant to this book in one way when interment was introduced in northern ireland when when interment which means interment without trial was introduced in northern ireland in belfast the kids used to sing

01:20.896 --> 01:22.178
That's fine, you just go ahead, I'll just check.

01:22.198 --> 01:27.986
They used to sing this song, Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep, the lyrics of which go, Where's your mama gone, little baby gone?

01:28.266 --> 01:30.509
Where's your daddy gone, little baby gone?

01:31.090 --> 01:32.993
Ooh-ee, chirpy chirpy Cheep Cheep.

01:33.013 --> 01:40.623
So you come down in the morning and daddy's not there, and you're still singing this hopperty skipperty, happy little ditty, a lyric.

01:40.823 --> 01:44.969
And it seemed to me that it's juxtaposing the kind of pantomime burlesque of mortality.

01:46.171 --> 01:46.431
Mm-hmm.

01:47.879 --> 01:52.389
with the seemingly ordinariness of people's humdrum lives.

01:52.409 --> 01:57.520
And I wanted to pick two outwardly unremarkable characters, you know, in the sense that... Starting with the music, Bill.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.963
Oh, sorry, get back to the music, yeah.

01:59.104 --> 02:00.767
And that was the kind of feeling.

02:00.807 --> 02:01.990
That's where the feeling starts.

02:02.170 --> 02:05.818
It doesn't start with the characters or the story?

02:06.059 --> 02:06.921
Well, the mood first.

02:07.001 --> 02:07.422
The mood.

02:07.542 --> 02:07.963
The mood first.

02:07.943 --> 02:10.587
And this is how you operate.

02:10.607 --> 02:15.293
Well, I don't sort of consciously sit down and listen to music in the hope that it'll ignite something.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.676
It's just over a period of time, these songs would have been in my mind.

02:17.736 --> 02:21.482
I don't know quite what they mean until various strands come together.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.584
You might have an image as a writer yourself, I'm sure.

02:24.045 --> 02:25.567
You operate on some level like that.

02:26.428 --> 02:33.498
And over a period of time, things begin to fuse and germinate, and I think it takes on a life of its own then, I think.

02:33.518 --> 02:35.180
All right, so then go on.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.123
Then you thought about some characters now.

02:37.964 --> 02:41.149
Yeah, outwardly unremarkable characters.

02:41.169 --> 02:43.472
I wanted to write about very ordinary kind of guys.

02:43.512 --> 02:44.433
Probably almost weak.

02:44.814 --> 02:46.656
Well, one of them would appear weak outside, perhaps.

02:47.377 --> 02:55.409
And to explore their inner lives in great depth, the psychological landscape, as it were.

02:56.671 --> 03:03.120
Also, the subtext to it is the collision of two Irlands, in one sense.

03:03.841 --> 03:04.562
Shall we say...

03:05.538 --> 03:18.515
the post-Civil War Ireland that was perhaps in a state of stasis or a sort of inertia, but also perhaps could be Ireland had a rhythm and order of its own, which was important to many people, maybe.

03:20.037 --> 03:33.735
And then the Ireland, which I perhaps know better myself, which would be the Ireland of John F. Kennedy, you know, the post-50s kind of kaleidoscopic Ireland, where the rising tide of the economy were said to lift all boats.

03:34.877 --> 03:35.157
And...

03:35.609 --> 03:39.954
The resulting fallout of that, some of it good, some of it bad, and the misunderstandings of both eras.

03:40.895 --> 03:42.457
But are you fundamentally a storyteller?

03:42.697 --> 03:42.937
Yeah.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.900
So this stuff is important.

03:46.521 --> 03:47.883
That's what you're talking about.

03:47.903 --> 03:49.124
But we still have to have a story.

03:49.444 --> 03:50.546
Well, without the story, it's nothing.

03:50.566 --> 03:56.672
Fundamentally, it's the caveman around the fire, you know, gathering the kids around, the middle I tell you.

03:56.853 --> 03:58.514
And we're here to be awed and enchanted.

03:58.534 --> 03:59.075
That's the one.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.857
And engaged and all that stuff.

04:00.877 --> 04:02.158
Yeah, that's the start of it.

04:02.899 --> 04:03.540
So then...

04:04.432 --> 04:14.147
Is there some anxiety in that choosing to write about, as you say, two unremarkable characters that people... I mean, there is a risk involved here.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.972
Absolutely, a very big risk, and I took it consciously.

04:17.992 --> 04:21.037
Because success disturbs me.

04:21.057 --> 04:27.146
There are things about success that I don't like, particularly because for 20 years I've been writing.

04:27.166 --> 04:31.873
You know, you said a tender age, but I mean, I've been writing since I was 19, and I didn't have any success.

04:31.955 --> 04:34.157
I was going to say publishing for how long, however?

04:34.257 --> 04:35.899
Publishing maybe since I was 23.

04:36.099 --> 04:39.022
Well, you know, not publishing that much.

04:39.042 --> 04:45.068
I mean, publishing a small novel, a couple of stories, stuff like that, and writing radio plays.

04:45.108 --> 04:46.049
But I wouldn't consider that.

04:46.069 --> 04:50.814
I mean, I was working hard at writing, and the amount of actual publication relative to that could be eager enough.

04:52.916 --> 05:00.223
So when people praise one of my books over another, for example, Music on Clinton Street Sold, which is my first novel, in fact,

05:01.132 --> 05:05.338
although The Butcher Boy is constantly referred to as my first novel, which it isn't.

05:05.659 --> 05:10.106
It's only about, I'd say, 50 copies, you know, and most of them were bought by my family.

05:10.126 --> 05:13.511
I was just about to say, your family probably had 25 of them.

05:13.531 --> 05:14.833
Yeah, I'm not saying how many I have.

05:16.015 --> 05:22.885
And the second book, which was called Cairn, which is now going to have been rehabilitated to some extent, which is my second novel.

05:22.966 --> 05:24.107
Rehabilitated by whom?

05:24.147 --> 05:24.608
By you?

05:25.010 --> 05:30.597
No, no, it's because of the fact that it was published and the people got to know about it.

05:30.637 --> 05:32.599
So in other words, you didn't go back and rework it or anything?

05:32.619 --> 05:33.500
Ah, no, that's forgery.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.461
Okay, that's good.

05:34.481 --> 05:35.983
That's a question I would have.

05:36.944 --> 05:38.586
Tim O'Brien, you know Tim O'Brien?

05:38.606 --> 05:38.746
Yeah.

05:38.926 --> 05:41.209
He's now in the process of rewriting his early novels.

05:41.269 --> 05:42.030
I don't agree with that.

05:42.631 --> 05:45.314
And a lot of people say, what are you doing?

05:45.334 --> 05:46.836
That's why this is completed work.

05:46.856 --> 05:50.159
This represents a time and a stage of development in your life.

05:50.179 --> 05:50.680
I cannot understand that.

05:51.115 --> 06:18.658
Well, anyway, the rehabilitative, and it says that it was published in paperback last year by Picador, and people went to it, and a lot of people liked it, but they didn't know about it the first time, so that book is as important to me as any book that was successful, and when The Butcher Boy came out, it got so much success, and just carry on, and I wanted it to almost like try something that was twice as difficult, because the character of The Butcher Boy was an engaging kind of standpoint,

06:20.292 --> 06:22.034
Where did he come from?

06:22.675 --> 06:26.540
Somewhere in the deep murky waters of the subconscious, I suppose.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.361
Down in there.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.644
And was there a musical influence?

06:29.664 --> 06:31.186
No, very much so.

06:31.426 --> 06:33.068
The Butcher Boy is a ballad, you see.

06:33.889 --> 06:36.893
The Butcher Boy is a ballad about loss and longing.

06:36.913 --> 06:42.740
About a girl who hangs herself due to disappointment and love.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.701
And it is that haunting.

06:51.190 --> 07:05.746
You know, if I could take the Malachy Dodging character who, because of the kind of cataclysmic event that occurs early in his life where he sees his mother in flagrant head delicto, closes his heart to her.

07:06.306 --> 07:07.968
But his heart opens slowly towards the end.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.071
He devotes his life to her when she's incapacitated by a stroke.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.414
It's really about love, the book, I think.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.197
Love and death.

07:17.358 --> 07:18.079
Did I interrupt you?

07:18.119 --> 07:19.180
No, go right ahead.

07:20.061 --> 07:21.062
Pardon me if I jump on the right.

07:21.278 --> 07:25.142
I have no book to help me here, but we're winging it.

07:25.182 --> 07:26.183
But I'm doing all right, aren't I?

07:26.243 --> 07:34.051
So you were born in 55, which would make you about 40, I would guess.

07:34.071 --> 07:35.132
I just turned it.

07:35.312 --> 07:39.777
So are you a transitional?

07:39.797 --> 07:41.018
Are you in a state of transition?

07:41.278 --> 07:42.379
Is this developing work?

07:42.459 --> 07:44.902
Is this mature work?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.603
Very much development.

07:47.344 --> 07:48.265
Very much, yeah.

07:49.055 --> 08:02.827
I think I'm telling the same story all the time from different angles, you know, and I don't know, I'm not quite sure myself what the story is, but I'd say maybe it's about, it's not the beginning, it's maybe coming towards the middle.

08:04.368 --> 08:06.450
But you think that that's interesting.

08:07.130 --> 08:18.420
I can't tell you how many authors I've interviewed over the years, Nadine Gordimer as one example, who said almost using the same precise words you just did, that it's all one story.

08:18.586 --> 08:27.736
It's like walking into a room looking at a piece of sculpture and just moving around and looking at it from a different angle.

08:28.317 --> 08:33.583
This book is from this angle, but it's the same piece of sculpture.

08:33.863 --> 08:37.828
You know how prolific she has been over the years.

08:38.989 --> 08:40.751
You're saying the same thing here.

08:41.092 --> 08:44.155
You may not even know exactly what the whole story is.

08:44.793 --> 08:46.696
Because that's what we're here for, you know.

08:46.816 --> 08:48.700
That's why we're on the road, to get to that point.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.284
And you don't know, you don't really know.

08:51.524 --> 08:53.488
But you certainly do feel that it is a corpus.

08:54.169 --> 08:54.850
Very much so, yeah.

08:55.010 --> 08:56.653
I certainly hope so.

08:57.755 --> 09:01.481
And what are you working on now for our next book?

09:01.782 --> 09:05.548
Well, there's a song running around my head called... We've got to explore this.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.972
That's all I can say, you know.

09:07.992 --> 09:11.037
I mean, I'm just trying to nail it down as best I can on words.

09:11.928 --> 09:19.937
There's a jaunty song in my head called Breakfast on Pluto, which was recorded by a one-man band in 1968 called Don Partridge.

09:19.957 --> 09:22.160
And it's the most beautiful little lyric I've ever heard.

09:22.200 --> 09:30.009
And somewhere at the back of my mind is a young girl of about eight years of age who's very jaunty and very witty, and she sings this song all the time.

09:30.390 --> 09:34.234
And the song is her character, her personality, because it's jaunty, flighty, and optimistic.

09:34.835 --> 09:40.281
Now, probably what's going to happen is some other song is going to come along and charge into this thing and destroy it.

09:40.565 --> 09:44.709
Well, that hasn't happened yet, so I'd like to write a nice happy book, but maybe I will.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.373
Maybe when you have kids of your own, it's easier to do that sort of thing.

09:49.573 --> 09:50.394
Do you have any children?

09:50.414 --> 09:51.495
I have two daughters, yeah.

09:51.515 --> 09:52.175
I have two daughters.

09:52.295 --> 09:53.056
How old are your daughters?

09:53.076 --> 09:54.197
Nine and seven.

09:54.217 --> 09:54.657
They're great.

09:54.737 --> 09:56.179
Am I 13 and 11?

09:56.239 --> 09:59.882
They maybe transform the world, yeah.

09:59.902 --> 10:00.402
Uh-huh.

10:00.422 --> 10:01.403
How about short fiction?

10:01.984 --> 10:03.125
I've done a lot of that, actually.

10:03.165 --> 10:04.126
I've never done journalism.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.628
I've done a lot of short stories.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.910
I have a collection of short stories that I haven't published yet.

10:08.930 --> 10:09.070
Mm-hmm.

10:09.556 --> 10:10.818
Were these previously published?

10:10.878 --> 10:12.279
They were, yeah.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.944
I won an award here and there for short fiction when I started off.

10:16.965 --> 10:22.552
Are you an Irish writer in your view?

10:22.572 --> 10:25.976
I'd like to be a writer with an Irish personality or an Irish soul or something.

10:26.256 --> 10:28.238
I'd like to belong to the world community of writers.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.362
But certainly my view of the world is...

10:31.628 --> 10:32.629
uniquely Irish.

10:33.070 --> 10:42.161
And when you write, do you have a specific reader in mind, or are you writing mainly to please or to satisfy yourself?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.005
It's a kind of mixture of both.

10:45.025 --> 10:47.248
I do take the reader into account all right, you know.

10:47.268 --> 10:51.193
But the reader, is this a nebulous and a vague reader, or is there a specific reader?

10:51.213 --> 10:55.118
I think it's someone like me, you know, someone that goes around the library, someone who looks at bookshops.

10:55.478 --> 10:57.761
But there's no specific sex or age?

10:58.021 --> 11:00.024
No, anyone, anyone that's interested.

11:00.044 --> 11:00.184
Uh-huh.

11:01.447 --> 11:07.216
But really, ultimately, it's like it is for yourself, first of all, and that you'll go mad if you don't get it down.

11:07.236 --> 11:10.561
You'll get it down right.

11:10.641 --> 11:17.752
Now, the butcher boy was widely praised and honored in England and everywhere else.

11:19.154 --> 11:28.028
There is a quite extraordinary trend recently in the Booker Prize, for instance, with the Kelman's...

11:29.240 --> 11:31.502
the recent controversy regarding him.

11:32.263 --> 11:35.346
How do you see yourself in this whole literary world?

11:35.366 --> 11:43.233
I mean, there's a conventional writer who writes in English.

11:43.253 --> 11:46.356
And then these others, regional types of writers.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.258
They're almost commonwealth writers, aren't they?

11:48.278 --> 11:49.039
Commonwealth writers, yeah.

11:49.059 --> 11:50.420
For a reclamation of the language, yeah.

11:50.440 --> 11:58.588
Yeah, and I did an interview with Kelman, and of course he's quite adamant on being, on writing in his dialect, and writing

11:59.733 --> 12:28.963
a Scottish kind of a representing Scottish literature I wonder you know are there any parallels with you here well I certainly don't see myself as flying the flag like for the working classes or anything else but like what really what really dictates the book for me whether it's going to be written in colloquial dialect or whether it's going to be written in a kind of paired omniscient narrative voice is the character in the mood of the book that will dictate it you know and if that that goes against what my previous views on the thing where well I'm going to I'm going to let it be character autonomous and go with it you know

12:29.467 --> 12:31.669
Because it's the music of the book that will dictate it for me.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.691
Let's explore the music.

12:33.731 --> 12:34.512
Are you a musician?

12:34.892 --> 12:35.413
I used to be.

12:35.453 --> 12:36.454
Well, I wasn't any good, though.

12:36.474 --> 12:37.475
Maybe I'm a failed musician.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.636
Maybe that's what it is.

12:38.656 --> 12:41.238
And when you say musician, are you a vocalist?

12:41.338 --> 12:45.602
Well, I used to play the piano and write songs, and I played with a country and western band for a while.

12:45.622 --> 12:45.823
Really?

12:47.524 --> 12:49.826
Popular in Ireland?

12:49.846 --> 12:51.548
Country music is hugely popular in Ireland.

12:51.628 --> 12:53.450
American country music?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.773
I played and the kind of Irish...

12:57.057 --> 12:58.338
version or breed of it.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.381
I played all over the country.

13:00.941 --> 13:04.405
But mainly I was a piano player, I suppose, who used to write songs.

13:04.746 --> 13:05.687
I was never any good.

13:05.727 --> 13:12.935
I mean, I didn't have a good voice or a bit of a bad ear, but I wasn't a bad lyricist, I suppose, but I never did anything much with it.

13:12.975 --> 13:14.937
And maybe that's what it's all about, you know.

13:14.957 --> 13:17.120
I really wanted to be up there in front of 10,000 people.

13:17.160 --> 13:22.726
Well, given your brothers, would you rather be a successful musician or a successful writer?

13:23.768 --> 13:25.950
I'd rather be a successful... I'd rather be a good writer.

13:26.285 --> 13:31.312
Good, I guess, is the more correct word.

13:31.853 --> 13:40.664
Is this an aspect of maturation or just a realization that you couldn't be a good musician in your view?

13:40.684 --> 13:42.767
No, I think it won't, you know, won't.

13:42.787 --> 13:45.491
Because I could have been a contender, Charlie.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.495
I could have been a musician.

13:48.897 --> 14:18.077
you know I mean I wasn't thrown out of the band or anything it's just that I was burning the candle at both ends and just touring and all the rest of it and you just couldn't do any writing so I was one or the other and I decided to and when you give your talks do you read basically whatever you talk I don't talk I'm not a good commentator on anything do you pick do you pick excerpts at random or do you have no I have maybe about a dozen in each book that I juggle around and how do you find the response to your work here in the United States it's unbelievable

14:18.513 --> 14:21.839
The audiences are magnificent.

14:21.979 --> 14:32.819
And do you think, contrary to what a lot of people say, that there aren't serious readers, or that a serious reader is in danger of becoming extinct, or do you disagree with that?

14:32.879 --> 14:38.530
All the evidence is to the contrary, and I've been everywhere that's possible to be the last couple of weeks.

14:39.171 --> 14:42.597
If anything, it seems to me that the written word and the spoken word

14:42.796 --> 14:46.079
but the audio temperature, general conversation, is fighting back.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.323
That's the way I see it.

14:49.463 --> 14:52.286
Huge bookshops, the cafes, you know.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.748
And how do you play in university towns?

14:55.469 --> 14:56.070
I did Berkeley.

14:56.430 --> 14:56.530
Good.

14:56.570 --> 14:59.653
You know, see, my column is carried in a lot of university towns.

14:59.673 --> 15:04.899
I'm out in Eugene, Oregon, for instance, and Knoxville, Tennessee, and Gainesville, Florida.

15:04.939 --> 15:08.162
You've got Charlottesville, so these are all big university towns.

15:08.851 --> 15:10.093
Well, Berkeley was fabulous.

15:10.153 --> 15:11.174
I had a great night out there.

15:11.194 --> 15:12.096
They invited me out.

15:12.296 --> 15:14.319
There was maybe 70 or 80 people there.

15:14.339 --> 15:15.220
Do you enjoy a good time?

15:15.541 --> 15:16.763
I have a good time.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.947
America is the place because you get both.

15:19.968 --> 15:25.656
You get the reader, you get the talker, you get the open heart, and you get plenty of fun.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.037
That's the one.

15:26.057 --> 15:27.959
Do you mind if we wrap it up pretty quick?

15:27.979 --> 15:28.180
It's fine.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.061
I've got plenty of stuff.

15:29.081 --> 15:31.124
Would you inscribe a couple?

15:31.144 --> 15:33.568
I've never been to L.A.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.153
You know the tattered cover?

15:37.640 --> 15:38.781
Yes, yes.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.804
You talk about the word and being alive, that's a huge place.

15:42.144 --> 15:52.534
Run by a woman who's an independent, right, who was threatened numerous times over the Salman Rushdie book, and she refused adamantly to take it off the shelf, you know?

15:52.554 --> 15:55.838
That takes a little bit of testosterone, doesn't it?

15:55.858 --> 15:57.159
It certainly does.

15:57.179 --> 15:57.539
It certainly does.

15:57.559 --> 15:58.981
It sure does.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.204
To be lonesome leaving America, I always get this feeling going back.

16:02.704 --> 16:03.045
Do you?

16:03.065 --> 16:03.385
Oh, yeah.

16:03.625 --> 16:04.666
How often do you come over?

16:04.686 --> 16:06.668
Ah, you see, I don't know that one at all.

16:07.255 --> 16:11.941
So, would you say you basically twiddled in obscurity prior to The Butcher Boy?

16:12.401 --> 16:13.222
Oh, absolutely.

16:13.703 --> 16:18.749
And what was it about that book that connected with readers, in your view?

16:20.872 --> 16:26.278
Their heart goes out to them in some peculiar way.

16:26.298 --> 16:33.567
Because the woman he murders did nothing wrong, and yet everybody's rooting for him to kill her.

16:34.019 --> 16:35.466
How did you manage to pull that off?

16:35.486 --> 16:35.988
I didn't try.

16:36.008 --> 16:36.832
I didn't try to do it.

16:36.912 --> 16:37.877
I don't know what happened there.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.067
I thought the feminists would destroy me.

16:40.790 --> 16:41.734
Feminists loved us.

16:41.849 --> 16:43.772
I don't know what it says about that.

16:43.792 --> 16:44.253
Why is that?

16:44.313 --> 16:45.354
Because she's such a bitch.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.458
She wasn't really such a bitch.

16:47.478 --> 16:57.012
I mean, she wasn't the most human person in the world, but she certainly didn't deserve to be plastered all over the kitchen wall.

16:57.032 --> 16:57.734
Now, what is this?

16:57.754 --> 16:59.697
This story, again, comes from a ballad, right?

16:59.817 --> 17:00.077
Yeah.

17:00.598 --> 17:01.319
Is there a moral?

17:01.559 --> 17:02.481
Do we learn something?

17:02.641 --> 17:04.304
How are we enriched by this story?

17:04.985 --> 17:05.806
Or is that important?

17:05.886 --> 17:07.288
Is that not important?

17:07.308 --> 17:08.430
I like people who tell me that.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.685
for them to investigate where they like it.

17:11.705 --> 17:22.341
I mean, I have a lot of views on it, but it's such, people come at it with such individual kind of feelings that everyone seems to like it for various different reasons.

17:22.361 --> 17:29.532
Another aspect of it that came out, too, I asked a girl in Australia what she liked about it, and she said, I always wanted to win a million, billion, trillion dollars, she said.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.375
And I know that puddle.

17:32.597 --> 17:37.945
There's the other puddle in the book, I don't know if you read the book, but there's this puddle in the book where the kids...

17:38.228 --> 17:38.969
hack at the ice.

17:39.089 --> 17:40.692
And everyone has done that, you know?

17:40.732 --> 17:43.537
The blue sky over everything, talking about winning the lottery.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.249
But essentially, I suppose, it's Huckleberry Finn kind of energy.

17:51.269 --> 17:56.477
It's like a stand-up comic taking on the world, and he's the classic underdog.

17:56.497 --> 17:58.040
You're having fun with it?

17:58.060 --> 17:58.581
Ah, yeah.

17:58.621 --> 17:59.582
I have a ball of the readings.

17:59.943 --> 18:01.345
So it's sort of a fancy Brady.

18:01.365 --> 18:04.210
He's a character in a fan club developing cult now, you know?

18:04.230 --> 18:05.552
And they turn up with all the readings.

18:06.123 --> 18:08.706
And they're at the front row with the book and they're going with it.

18:08.726 --> 18:11.068
Do you have your legions of devoted collectors yet?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.690
No, I don't have any of that yet.

18:13.451 --> 18:29.047
Well, I would imagine those first couple books of yours are very collectible now and very... They're publishing... I wouldn't let the first one go because it's not good enough, but they're publishing the second one here next year, which is nice.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.628
It's nice to bring them in from the phone.

18:30.648 --> 18:32.810
So you think the stories will come next or a novel?

18:33.371 --> 18:34.392
No, it'll be another novel.

18:35.232 --> 18:38.718
And that's in progress or still in germination right now?

18:38.738 --> 18:41.402
It's sort of in progress, even if you're thinking about it, isn't it?

18:41.422 --> 18:42.664
Uh-huh.

18:42.684 --> 18:46.310
There's a wonderful old New Yorker cartoon that shows a guy lying down in a hammock.

18:46.350 --> 18:47.331
Is that it working?

18:47.351 --> 18:50.056
He says, listen, a writer is always working.

18:50.076 --> 18:50.737
How does it go?

18:51.899 --> 18:54.743
A writer is always writing, but he's writing.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.619
Um...

20:10.913 --> 20:11.829
Hello!

21:11.309 --> 21:13.236
Thanks.

22:40.966 --> 22:50.670
Can I take some shower?

22:50.690 --> 22:50.790
Yeah.

23:40.501 --> 24:00.995
Is it?

24:01.015 --> 24:01.075
Hi.

24:14.875 --> 24:20.717
Bye, Mama.

40:11.840 --> 40:30.151
One day.

40:30.171 --> 40:30.332
One day.

40:30.352 --> 40:30.512
One day.

40:30.532 --> 40:30.692
One day.

40:30.712 --> 40:30.873
One day.

40:30.893 --> 40:31.053
One day.

40:31.073 --> 40:31.233
One day.

40:31.253 --> 40:31.413
One day.

40:31.434 --> 40:31.594
One day.

40:31.614 --> 40:31.774
One day.

40:31.794 --> 40:31.954
One day.

40:31.974 --> 40:32.135
One day.

40:32.155 --> 40:32.315
One day.

40:32.335 --> 40:32.495
One day.

40:32.515 --> 40:32.676
One day.

40:32.696 --> 40:32.856
One day.

40:32.876 --> 40:33.036
One day.

40:33.056 --> 40:33.217
One day.

40:33.237 --> 40:33.397
One day.

40:33.417 --> 40:33.577
One day.

40:33.597 --> 40:33.757
One day.

40:33.778 --> 40:33.938
One day.

40:33.958 --> 40:34.118
One day.

40:34.138 --> 40:34.298
One day.

40:34.318 --> 40:34.479
One day.

40:34.499 --> 40:34.659
One day.

40:34.679 --> 40:34.839
One day.

40:34.859 --> 40:35.020
One day.

40:35.040 --> 40:35.200
One day.

40:35.220 --> 40:35.380
One day.

40:35.400 --> 40:35.561
One day.

40:35.581 --> 40:35.741
One day.

40:35.761 --> 40:35.921
One day.

40:35.941 --> 40:36.101
One day.

40:36.122 --> 40:36.282
One day.

40:36.302 --> 40:36.462
One day.

40:36.482 --> 40:36.642
One day.

40:36.662 --> 40:36.823
One day.

40:36.843 --> 40:37.003
One day.

41:09.687 --> 41:10.991
I'm going for one.

42:19.988 --> 42:36.870
Oh, no.

42:36.891 --> 42:37.311
Never missed the one.

42:37.331 --> 42:37.451
I was.

42:37.471 --> 42:38.413
Well then, you never wanted to have the family.

42:38.433 --> 42:38.773
I needed a house.

42:53.975 --> 43:14.182
Kelly, have you ever been inside the person in Vermont?

43:14.202 --> 43:14.683
Would you keep in touch?

43:31.522 --> 43:54.431
Did I die?

43:54.451 --> 43:55.012
You didn't give me a chance.

43:55.032 --> 43:55.352
Should've tried.

44:03.770 --> 44:22.855
Are we still together at 10 years?

44:22.875 --> 44:23.395
Yes, we're still together.

44:23.415 --> 44:23.736
Yeah, make sure.

44:23.756 --> 44:24.176
What about the years?

44:24.196 --> 44:24.537
Out of bed, yeah.

44:24.557 --> 44:24.817
I'm not dead.

44:24.837 --> 44:25.238
What about your mom?

44:25.258 --> 44:25.838
It's going to be alive, okay.

44:25.858 --> 44:26.519
Why can't I just get out of here?

44:26.539 --> 44:27.060
Why can't I just run away?

44:36.828 --> 45:03.196
Matt, I don't want to go.

45:03.216 --> 45:03.517
Get back to it.

45:03.537 --> 45:03.797
I'm pregnant.

45:05.549 --> 45:09.785
Cool.

45:09.805 --> 45:09.906
Nice.

45:26.795 --> 45:54.329
That's right, Buddha!

45:54.349 --> 45:55.030
What are you, Mr. Stanley, Buddha?

46:00.258 --> 46:09.265
Up here.

46:09.285 --> 46:09.707
How did you miss him?

46:09.727 --> 46:10.188
You know what's coming?

46:10.208 --> 46:10.509
It was a T.E.C.

46:10.529 --> 46:10.609
car.

46:10.629 --> 46:11.352
Son of a bitch says that I had died.

46:11.372 --> 46:11.713
So learn tonight.

46:11.733 --> 46:12.495
You don't kill him, you don't go back.

48:47.742 --> 49:07.868
What?

49:07.888 --> 49:08.369
I think it's time clock.

49:08.389 --> 49:08.870
I think it's time clock.

49:08.890 --> 49:09.110
Time clock.

49:09.130 --> 49:09.691
Do you want to hold it back?

49:09.711 --> 49:09.871
Careful.

49:09.891 --> 49:10.452
What do you want to do here?

49:10.472 --> 49:11.033
Do you want to get a butter?

49:11.053 --> 49:11.233
Up there.

49:11.253 --> 49:11.353
Okay.

49:12.953 --> 49:19.993
Yeah, yeah.

49:49.792 --> 49:55.988
What are you having?

50:34.662 --> 50:37.922
... ...

51:47.680 --> 51:49.050
Thank you.

52:19.355 --> 52:23.847
All right.

53:14.924 --> 53:44.678
I find it reassuring to know if the future holds so much.

53:48.185 --> 54:11.540
Not only will it turn this down to do that, it will also separate every part of you from every other part of the circle.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.141
Because I don't want to know.

54:12.161 --> 54:12.842
The Agent Walker is too miserable.

54:12.862 --> 54:13.402
But Officer Walker is dead.

54:13.423 --> 54:14.104
He's just not a disease statistic.

54:14.124 --> 54:14.664
When he's gone, he'll come.

54:14.684 --> 54:15.726
If the younger one wants him to see this, he's dead.

54:15.746 --> 54:16.287
No, he's not dead tomorrow.

54:16.307 --> 54:17.048
If he was dead, he would not be here.

54:17.068 --> 54:17.128
OK?

54:18.762 --> 54:21.972
I don't know.

54:46.032 --> 54:53.055
Oh, no!

55:13.842 --> 55:19.403
Hey, Mo!

55:19.423 --> 55:19.744
I'm out of here.

55:19.764 --> 55:20.487
Hey, Mo, what's the way out of here?

55:20.507 --> 55:21.270
I want to do what's pretty incredible.

55:40.758 --> 56:04.249
They just keep taking my time.

56:04.269 --> 56:04.629
God, I'm sad, huh?

56:04.649 --> 56:05.611
Seven years, my business would never come short.

56:05.631 --> 56:06.732
And one day, myself put my seven years for ten dollars.

56:18.895 --> 56:34.221
Are we going to do a shoot?

56:36.243 --> 56:57.566
There's a bomb that's going to go off in a second now.

56:57.587 --> 56:58.127
You know what happens then?

56:58.147 --> 56:58.688
Well, I'm going to be dead.

56:58.708 --> 56:59.308
And I'm going to win my fault.

56:59.328 --> 57:00.610
My young self is super aggressive, and you can't save your wife.

57:00.630 --> 57:01.431
Just like you could've been once before.

57:01.451 --> 57:01.971
She died because she died.

57:01.991 --> 57:02.432
She made some changes.

57:02.452 --> 57:03.193
So now you're going to fuck with her.

57:03.213 --> 57:03.773
You're going to try to stay.

57:03.793 --> 57:03.913
Wrong.

57:03.934 --> 57:04.294
I'm staying right.

57:04.314 --> 57:05.235
You know, usually I take those more than once.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.216
But in this case, I don't see any other options.

57:06.753 --> 57:20.101
I do.

57:20.121 --> 57:20.502
What are you doing?

57:20.522 --> 57:21.204
What do you mean when you call me?

57:21.224 --> 57:22.146
You left a message when I sent it out for you.

57:22.166 --> 57:23.108
Then leave a message, I'm talking to you again.

57:23.128 --> 57:23.569
And I'll be on myself.

57:23.589 --> 57:24.030
And I'll be on myself.

57:24.050 --> 57:24.711
No, no, I didn't feel it for you.

57:27.357 --> 57:43.054
It's a real mess, huh?

57:43.074 --> 57:43.775
Don't you have to do the real mess?

57:43.795 --> 57:44.956
It turns out to be a quick ordinary word in the bloodbath.

57:44.976 --> 57:45.797
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:45.817 --> 57:46.638
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:46.658 --> 57:47.479
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:47.499 --> 57:48.320
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.160
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:49.181 --> 57:50.001
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:50.021 --> 57:50.842
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:50.862 --> 57:51.683
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:51.703 --> 57:52.524
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

57:52.544 --> 57:53.365
You can't deny your comfort of the devil.

59:10.042 --> 59:13.082
Bye.

59:47.015 --> 01:00:13.892
We have been waiting for this.

01:00:13.912 --> 01:00:14.452
What do you want to do now?

01:00:14.472 --> 01:00:15.013
What do you want to do now?

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:43.317
Hey, where are you going?

01:00:43.337 --> 01:00:43.758
What happened to you?

01:00:43.778 --> 01:00:44.319
What are you talking about?

01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:44.860
Who are you talking about?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.721
Yeah, because I just don't know about you.

01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:46.402
It's just right here, that's all.

01:00:46.422 --> 01:00:46.842
Hey, what's going on?

01:00:46.862 --> 01:00:47.163
That's my call.

01:00:47.183 --> 01:00:47.443
It's my call.

01:00:47.463 --> 01:00:48.004
Look, if you want time off.

01:00:51.359 --> 01:01:08.301
10 years ago, we called up in Albany, and 12th morning, disappeared, somebody's ever seen it.

01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:08.581
I don't know.

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:08.862
I don't know.

01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:50.340
This time still is strong.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:50.700
Do you like that?

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:50.961
I guess not.

01:01:50.981 --> 01:01:51.421
Hey, what do you want?

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.062
I'm still waiting for a chance.

01:02:05.795 --> 01:02:07.014
Thank you.

01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:44.227
.

01:02:44.247 --> 01:02:44.267
.

01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:44.307
.
