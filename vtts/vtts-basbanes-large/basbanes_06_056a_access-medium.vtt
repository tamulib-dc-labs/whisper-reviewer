00:02.225 --> 00:04.047
Hey, this guy's on the wall.

00:04.067 --> 00:06.249
This is number two of the Baskin tape.

00:07.350 --> 00:11.254
Belong to The Earls of Arenberg, North Kyrton.

00:11.294 --> 00:12.495
Very great collection.

00:13.135 --> 00:14.236
There are three books here.

00:14.316 --> 00:15.237
The book that interests us.

00:15.838 --> 00:17.379
Who puts these little things in there?

00:17.740 --> 00:18.420
The bookseller.

00:18.681 --> 00:19.962
That's not such a great idea.

00:20.002 --> 00:21.003
It doesn't matter.

00:21.023 --> 00:23.185
We bought this from Colin Franklin in 1985.

00:23.425 --> 00:28.089
And he wanted... No, no, no.

00:28.109 --> 00:29.751
Yeah, but that's going to discolor, isn't it?

00:30.187 --> 00:32.190
What's going to discolor?

00:32.210 --> 00:33.772
Isn't that going to discolor the entry?

00:33.992 --> 00:34.693
Possibly.

00:36.135 --> 00:36.436
Doesn't matter.

00:36.456 --> 00:38.539
It's probably done some damage right there a few.

00:39.961 --> 00:42.384
I should take it out.

00:42.404 --> 00:43.306
There are three books.

00:43.346 --> 00:44.367
This is the book.

00:44.868 --> 00:46.150
It's called Kunstbuchlein.

00:46.210 --> 00:47.371
It's a little book of art.

00:47.391 --> 00:48.192
Do you count, Jeremy?

00:48.473 --> 00:48.693
No.

00:50.516 --> 00:50.896
$15.99.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.900
A novel book.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.783
It's like an artist's morgue.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.285
You know what that is?

00:57.365 --> 00:59.248
If you were to get a paper, you should know.

00:59.853 --> 01:04.958
You want to know how to do a horseman, a different nationality.

01:06.059 --> 01:11.544
You want to know how to do an old witch, or a civil, or different costumes.

01:11.565 --> 01:13.306
You want to know how a drummer looks.

01:13.506 --> 01:14.968
Those are some of the sharpest plates.

01:14.988 --> 01:17.851
And how to do a turks cat.

01:17.891 --> 01:20.253
The ink is a little darker on some of these.

01:20.273 --> 01:20.794
Yeah, of course.

01:21.074 --> 01:22.896
How many of these plates do you think that they would pull?

01:23.777 --> 01:25.638
Oh, this is not a common book.

01:25.698 --> 01:28.341
This is a six, seven thousand dollar book today.

01:29.215 --> 01:34.339
But Rubens, there are drawings by Rubens of a lot of these pages, which he copied.

01:34.360 --> 01:34.840
He used it as an author.

01:34.860 --> 01:35.881
You see, he used it.

01:36.481 --> 01:37.162
He learned from it.

01:37.182 --> 01:38.964
And here you see it.

01:38.984 --> 01:40.085
But you've got to know that again.

01:40.605 --> 01:42.687
Your dealer didn't know that, did he?

01:42.707 --> 01:43.087
Yeah.

01:43.167 --> 01:44.609
He knew that, sure.

01:44.629 --> 01:47.431
Well, the thing is, we've owned this book before.

01:47.451 --> 01:48.492
We've sold it once.

01:48.512 --> 01:48.932
We've sold it.

01:48.952 --> 01:49.653
And it was so hard.

01:49.673 --> 01:51.294
It was one of our favorite books.

01:51.314 --> 01:53.817
It was so hard to have sold it, and we bought it first.

01:53.837 --> 01:54.958
We bought another copy.

01:54.978 --> 01:57.720
Give me the title once again, becauseâ€” Kunstbuchlein.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.668
Kunst, Art, Buch, Buch.

02:00.868 --> 02:01.909
Line is little.

02:02.310 --> 02:03.131
Little art book.

02:03.171 --> 02:04.152
How would you spell that?

02:04.692 --> 02:07.456
K-U-N-S-T-B-U-C-H-L-I-N.

02:08.016 --> 02:08.777
And then by whom?

02:08.797 --> 02:09.758
Who was the question?

02:09.778 --> 02:10.860
Joost Amann.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.824
Joost Amann von Nuremberg.

02:14.844 --> 02:14.944
Okay.

02:14.964 --> 02:20.511
Published by his friend, Sigmund... Look at the date on it.

02:20.531 --> 02:20.851
1599.

02:20.971 --> 02:26.177
It was crystal, it was 20 years ago.

02:26.197 --> 02:26.478
Or yesterday.

02:26.498 --> 02:26.678
Gorgeous.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.055
Do you feel the magic in these rooms?

02:29.075 --> 02:31.557
I mean, I don't want to go up here.

02:31.617 --> 02:32.338
No, no magic.

02:32.358 --> 02:33.799
No magic.

02:33.839 --> 02:35.281
You feel it, don't you?

02:35.301 --> 02:38.744
You know, there were model books for everything.

02:39.364 --> 02:41.386
For handwriting, you know about writing.

02:41.406 --> 02:41.546
Mm-hmm.

02:41.567 --> 02:42.608
Telegraphy.

02:42.628 --> 02:42.768
Mm-hmm.

02:45.230 --> 02:45.791
Oh, boy.

02:49.694 --> 02:50.235
Both.

02:50.255 --> 02:51.456
So who designed the room?

02:52.297 --> 02:52.857
Both?

02:53.218 --> 02:53.678
Both of them.

02:53.928 --> 02:55.771
No.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.393
But you had to have this high ceiling.

02:57.533 --> 02:58.635
The ceiling was here.

02:58.695 --> 02:59.556
This was a shell.

02:59.576 --> 03:01.319
But I mean, you saw the potential.

03:01.359 --> 03:02.521
I saw the potential.

03:02.541 --> 03:04.564
Because you go 11 tiers up.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.589
And, you know, we drew it on the wall.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.432
We had two very good properties.

03:10.452 --> 03:17.082
We had wonderful properties.

03:17.102 --> 03:17.843
Is this the tumble?

03:18.884 --> 03:20.627
This is an incredibly rare little thing.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.567
We don't make full leather boxes.

03:24.587 --> 03:28.091
Well, show this first, because then it comes back from behind.

03:28.491 --> 03:37.181
They're published by the same guy, which is his name, Tatsy, a very active publisher in the middle of the 16th century, going into the 17th century.

03:37.501 --> 03:40.545
This is a little garden of writing, you see.

03:41.265 --> 03:43.408
G-A-I-D-I-N-E-T-T-O.

03:43.428 --> 03:47.172
G-A-I-D-I-N-E-T-T-O.

03:47.641 --> 03:51.004
And it's by Gasparo Colombo Padavano.

03:51.305 --> 03:52.766
P-A-P-O-V-A-N-O.

03:52.987 --> 03:54.969
Padavano means he was from Padua.

03:54.989 --> 03:59.413
That's from Padua right there.

04:01.295 --> 04:05.620
And this is a book of telegraphic examples.

04:05.820 --> 04:09.824
But it's never been cut by a binder, you see.

04:09.844 --> 04:11.926
It's as the sheets were printed.

04:12.287 --> 04:13.648
And writing books are...

04:13.882 --> 04:39.417
rare to find a in good condition because they were used but was it was it should it have been cut i mean by design i've never seen another copy but i dare say if there was another copy they would have trimmed it you know so that's one so that's the writing that's the kind of model so we have other writing but you know calligraphic model but this book also this book combines calligraphy writing and lace design

04:40.173 --> 04:45.358
Because, you know, the women who did the lace needed to know how to do alphabets.

04:45.378 --> 04:47.680
And this has a combination for lace.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.081
So the borders are lace patterns.

04:49.422 --> 04:54.607
And these are sayings and things that are... And the center was full history.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.289
So the combination of words.

04:57.309 --> 05:00.813
These are... This is the... This is the... Right.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.394
Yeah, that's our 300.

05:03.275 --> 05:05.477
We have had three libraries in real life.

05:07.159 --> 05:08.560
This is incredibly great.

05:09.805 --> 05:11.166
It's incredibly rare.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.468
It's not even complete.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.472
But these lace books are so scary.

05:16.492 --> 05:19.515
Well, the model, it's like buying a knitting pattern, but it's throwing it away.

05:19.535 --> 05:21.177
Yeah, but they used it up, you see.

05:21.437 --> 05:27.864
It was, again, it's not ephemeral in any way, but it's, its function was short-term, but not very short-term.

05:28.785 --> 05:37.855
Well, that's the kind of book which I love, and I would love to buy more of, but here is an early collection of,

05:38.527 --> 05:41.311
of looks on seruriers.

05:42.332 --> 05:45.736
De Verges' piece, seruriers, lock-making, right?

05:46.377 --> 05:55.309
Described, invented by Hugh Brisson, et cetera, and by Jean Valais, famous 17th century, 1662.

05:55.329 --> 05:56.551
And you see how this goes.

05:56.571 --> 05:58.673
I mean, it's fabulous.

05:58.693 --> 05:59.695
God, look at that.

05:59.715 --> 06:06.444
This is the whole book.

06:06.464 --> 06:06.824
God, look at that.

06:06.844 --> 06:07.605
This one for Christmas.

06:07.990 --> 06:30.200
These impressions are sad here.

06:30.220 --> 06:30.761
These are key roles, right?

06:30.781 --> 06:31.542
There's another key role, you can see.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.525
It looks great, it's a normal thing.

06:34.214 --> 06:45.005
The things you, tell me if you can give me some kind of a statement, you know, just reach into the creative spirit and come out of something on the meaning of these things.

06:45.265 --> 06:46.006
I love it.

06:47.427 --> 06:56.136
In fact, I'm thrilled that he wasn't saying that much for attention because I can compete with stuff like this.

06:56.696 --> 06:58.158
This is from a different set.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.521
A little focus.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.111
Is that a book plate, per se?

07:08.151 --> 07:26.558
What do we call these little steps?

07:27.479 --> 07:32.166
I call it a bookmark.

07:32.568 --> 07:33.469
Well, it's really, it's a book plate.

07:33.489 --> 07:34.170
It's a book plate.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.392
It's a book plate, but I thought that's bookmarked.

07:36.412 --> 07:41.137
Because that's our, our mark.

07:41.157 --> 07:43.880
Here's what happened to those plates.

07:44.641 --> 07:45.341
Here's a book.

07:46.282 --> 07:49.305
You look here, it says, number two, right?

07:49.506 --> 07:51.708
Designs d'ordement pour les chambres.

07:52.429 --> 07:53.069
You get that?

07:53.230 --> 07:53.370
Mm-hmm.

07:55.031 --> 07:56.533
Freezes.

07:56.767 --> 08:02.356
This was from some cabinetmaker's shop in Paris or somewhere in France.

08:02.377 --> 08:04.741
And these are, this is Stefano Della Bella.

08:04.941 --> 08:09.829
I figured out each of these sets and written down the information.

08:10.029 --> 08:12.995
And these, they go up into the late 17th century.

08:13.415 --> 08:17.602
And you can find that very set that I showed you would be here if the plates survive.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.205
They just keep grinding them out.

08:19.706 --> 08:22.150
And these become invaluable for a workshop.

08:23.007 --> 08:25.710
You can see how this is all stuff to be used.

08:25.850 --> 08:34.701
You see, broad tasks and... I would love to find some more stuff like that.

08:34.721 --> 08:37.384
But that's how these plates work.

08:37.404 --> 08:42.049
Do you ever use any of this stuff to... Make my own words?

08:43.090 --> 08:43.190
Yeah.

08:43.210 --> 08:44.071
Well... Willing, no.

08:44.111 --> 08:48.476
You see, as Lisa was telling you, we've been selecting ornament prints just lately.

08:48.496 --> 08:49.858
This is one of our areas.

08:50.108 --> 08:55.133
See, for what I'm about to show you, many great books could come to us.

08:55.153 --> 08:58.436
But these are just, you know, single prints of ornaments and grotesque.

08:59.136 --> 09:03.440
And lately, my books have been reflecting this interest.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.822
So the answer is yes, the answer.

09:06.023 --> 09:09.746
But I would say that the collecting does not have utility.

09:09.806 --> 09:16.192
There's no utility into the collecting enterprise.

09:16.272 --> 09:19.255
That is, for the artist, but willy-nilly,

09:19.572 --> 09:23.717
As I'm working in similar materials, there is an influence.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.679
I would have to be dead inside if there wasn't.

09:27.020 --> 09:27.361
Right?

09:27.681 --> 09:28.662
Right.

09:28.682 --> 09:29.123
Okay.

09:29.643 --> 09:35.250
I'm going to wrap up pretty soon because I think the recorders can't think much more.

09:35.330 --> 09:39.394
Let me have to drive home.

09:39.414 --> 09:40.496
I want to call you again.

09:40.516 --> 09:43.299
We may have a few gaps to fill.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.963
You haven't really scratched the surface here.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.574
There's some background.

09:48.634 --> 09:49.575
Seymour Edelman.

09:50.115 --> 09:53.739
We would go to Philadelphia to visit Seymour.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.701
Now, how did you know Seymour?

09:55.721 --> 09:59.125
Well, I was teaching one year.

09:59.145 --> 10:07.574
I taught the senior students at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where Thomas Aikens taught, which is why I accepted that speech there.

10:07.994 --> 10:08.775
And commuted.

10:08.795 --> 10:09.456
And commuted.

10:10.197 --> 10:13.660
And in those days, we had an active Aikens collection.

10:14.401 --> 10:16.343
I loved Aikens.

10:17.302 --> 10:27.615
And I did a book for the, a Gehenna Press book for the print club of Philadelphia, of which Seymour Aylman was then the president.

10:28.496 --> 10:32.761
And there was a little party when the book was published, and I met him, and we hid it.

10:34.944 --> 10:43.815
He knew every name I mentioned, and I knew everyone he mentioned from Haldane McCall, well, McLean McCall.

10:44.133 --> 10:49.118
to everyone else, and we just talked and talked and talked for a night, and we'd become great friends.

10:49.138 --> 10:50.880
And then Lisa became great friends.

10:51.381 --> 10:55.966
And he was a great collector, probably the world's greatest collector of Haussmann, A. E. Haussmann.

10:56.026 --> 10:56.406
Not probably.

10:56.807 --> 10:57.327
Without a doubt.

10:57.347 --> 10:58.689
Well, John Carter was the other.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.532
Great collection of romantic literature.

11:01.552 --> 11:02.593
Of romantic literature.

11:03.034 --> 11:05.636
Unbelievable.

11:05.696 --> 11:06.417
Unbelievable.

11:06.517 --> 11:09.921
But also collected pugilism.

11:10.036 --> 11:10.777
Yeah.

11:10.797 --> 11:14.502
In his collection... Well, he was interested in it.

11:15.123 --> 11:16.505
And a great Aikens collection.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.229
And a great Aikens collection.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.092
It's all intact at Bryn Mawr.

11:21.112 --> 11:32.388
It's not all intact, because Seymour had to sell certain things that he collected to raise money to buy Thomas Aikens' house.

11:32.408 --> 11:35.132
Which he gave to the city of Philadelphia.

11:35.213 --> 11:37.557
So Seymour sold off a lot of his agent.

11:37.717 --> 11:40.621
Oh, yeah.

11:40.721 --> 11:44.247
And Seymour is a great eccentric.

11:45.328 --> 11:46.090
Never married.

11:47.111 --> 11:48.473
Never threw a catalog away.

11:48.553 --> 11:49.936
No one has ever been to his apartment.

11:49.956 --> 11:56.125
We would go to visit him in Philadelphia, and we would stay at a hotel, and Seymour would visit us, and he would bring

11:57.438 --> 11:59.881
Briefcase, a brown leather briefcase.

11:59.901 --> 12:01.203
Why didn't she go in with him?

12:01.223 --> 12:02.885
Because he wouldn't want to see us.

12:02.945 --> 12:04.507
He never went into his apartment.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.209
No, he never went into his apartment.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.012
He said, you know the Collier brothers?

12:09.773 --> 12:11.435
I make them look like pikers.

12:11.996 --> 12:12.657
And his parents were still alive.

12:12.677 --> 12:15.000
And apparently you couldn't move in their apartment.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.582
He had elderly parents.

12:16.742 --> 12:19.025
He received catalogs beginning in the early 1920s.

12:19.045 --> 12:20.206
And he never threw a thing out.

12:20.226 --> 12:21.708
He never threw on a wall.

12:21.728 --> 12:24.171
And his lawyer had never been in his apartment until he died.

12:25.147 --> 12:30.875
We were so amazed that they didn't break it up and sell it, though.

12:31.896 --> 12:34.580
Oh, the Bryn Mawr Library, Bryn Mawr College.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.602
When he was alive.

12:35.982 --> 12:38.105
No, when he was still alive.

12:38.686 --> 12:41.971
James Tanner's librarian somehow got him.

12:41.991 --> 12:45.235
That's right.

12:45.836 --> 12:47.719
He became a curator of his own collection.

12:48.339 --> 12:54.428
He kept his collection in bank vault, in the first fiduciary bank of Philadelphia.

12:54.644 --> 12:56.447
What was the source of his wealth?

12:56.707 --> 12:59.010
His father owned a big piece of Chester, PA.

12:59.030 --> 13:01.975
He was very bad.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.757
Seymour didn't work the day he was alive.

13:03.777 --> 13:04.659
Really?

13:04.679 --> 13:09.806
Anyway, when he was alive, all of his things went to Bryn Mawr with Seymour.

13:10.427 --> 13:13.011
And Seymour commuted to Bryn Mawr.

13:13.031 --> 13:18.779
I mean, Seymour was then in his 70s, and he had three rooms downstairs in the Bryn Mawr Library.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.081
And he was happy.

13:20.101 --> 13:21.984
He saw his things for the first time in 15 years.

13:22.004 --> 13:22.845
Out of the bank.

13:23.551 --> 13:24.512
He only could see little.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.337
He had no idea what was in those books after a while.

13:27.377 --> 13:31.543
We'd go and stay in a hotel, and Seymour would come up to our room with his brown briefcase.

13:31.583 --> 13:43.541
He would sit on the bed, and he would open the briefcase, and he would take out a parcel very neatly wrapped in brown wrapping paper, tied with a string.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.366
A carte de visite that belongs to Thomas Aiken's thing.

13:46.386 --> 13:47.247
Slowly unwrapped.

13:48.442 --> 13:49.504
It's Keith.

13:49.744 --> 13:50.425
It could be anything.

13:50.445 --> 13:51.086
A Keith's letter.

13:51.106 --> 13:53.109
He had the only Keith's letter in private hand.

13:53.129 --> 13:53.650
One of two.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.032
Well, not one of seven, actually.

13:55.192 --> 13:55.773
At that time.

13:55.993 --> 13:59.879
And just the most extraordinary things would come out of his little briefcase.

13:59.899 --> 14:02.543
He would bring about six things to show us.

14:02.563 --> 14:06.368
He also had a wonderful collection of unpublished Aikens photographs.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.872
Now, most of this stuff is worth a very much.

14:08.892 --> 14:09.112
All of it.

14:09.252 --> 14:12.357
Except for the Aikens material, which went to the Dietrich

14:12.742 --> 14:17.508
A lot of it, but a lot of the photographs are still at Brindman.

14:17.528 --> 14:18.028
Oh, wow.

14:18.048 --> 14:21.132
Oh, yeah, and I did a portrait of him.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.956
And it's a book, and there was a New Yorker thing on, a piece on him.

14:24.316 --> 14:26.198
Have you ever heard of the Scheider Library?

14:26.218 --> 14:26.699
Scheider?

14:26.919 --> 14:27.179
Yeah.

14:28.141 --> 14:29.763
Yeah, I've seen that.

14:29.923 --> 14:30.543
S-C-H-E-I-D-E?

14:30.563 --> 14:30.764
Yeah.

14:30.784 --> 14:31.625
I've seen them all.

14:31.725 --> 14:35.610
Scheider, he bought Gutenberg Bibles from Krauss, right?

14:35.630 --> 14:37.652
He's a millionaire.

14:38.105 --> 14:40.609
Of course, Shida.

14:40.709 --> 14:44.456
He's incredibly rich.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.340
He's got more fucking money than anyone in the world.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.083
And you know where that collection is?

14:49.103 --> 14:50.486
I just found myself the other day.

14:50.886 --> 14:51.668
Roger Stein.

14:51.748 --> 14:57.377
I was down there interviewing Roger, and I said, well, I've got to get out of the J.C.

14:57.457 --> 14:58.519
Dillon.

14:58.559 --> 15:01.844
That's really the greatest example of generational collection.

15:02.626 --> 15:03.427
There's Roger, you know.

15:03.447 --> 15:04.028
He says, oh, yeah?

15:04.649 --> 15:11.201
takes his book off the shelf, privately printed, 1947, the Scheider Family Library in Princeton, New Jersey.

15:11.782 --> 15:19.836
It's three or four generations, privately, still privately owned, Mr. Scheider, which has consented to an interview, and then he writes to them.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.922
They built a building at Princeton University.

15:22.962 --> 15:25.607
It joins the library, but they've got the keys.

15:26.448 --> 15:27.009
It's theirs.

15:27.310 --> 15:28.292
It's their library.

15:28.312 --> 15:29.053
It's their building

15:29.320 --> 15:32.346
It's going to come today.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.408
It may or may not.

15:33.429 --> 15:38.539
But it's still a privately owned, and Roger says, and Roger we know, world class.

15:38.980 --> 15:50.063
Oh, I know, because I remember when Hans-Peter Krauss sold one of his last Gutenberg Bible sales with Scheider, and I think in those days he paid.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.786
Two million bucks or something, or one and a half.

15:52.906 --> 15:54.408
A tremendous sum in those.

15:54.969 --> 15:56.391
So about 15 years ago.

15:56.411 --> 15:58.213
Okay, so I called blind the other day.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.497
I got the man in the memory of the shadow library called.

16:01.557 --> 16:04.461
This guy, Bill Stonehan, answers the phone.

16:04.481 --> 16:07.064
He said, well, I'm just Chez Curita, a librarian.

16:07.665 --> 16:08.526
And I told him what I was doing.

16:09.087 --> 16:09.988
He said, sounds pretty good.

16:10.008 --> 16:11.189
He said, you send me some things.

16:11.289 --> 16:13.592
And I sent him a little package there.

16:13.612 --> 16:14.954
And he'll send me some things.

16:15.234 --> 16:16.015
And we leave that.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.058
And they are doing a show at the grocery club.

16:18.697 --> 16:20.719
Of the family collections?

16:20.739 --> 16:25.124
Yeah, some examples of the family collections in the beginning of April and January.

16:25.144 --> 16:27.387
We don't belong to the group.

16:27.407 --> 16:28.608
I resigned.

16:28.748 --> 16:30.650
It comes a year, yeah.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.331
Am I?

16:31.351 --> 16:31.471
Is it?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.553
There's any reason they didn't have women at that time.

16:34.234 --> 16:34.955
Well, that's a good reason.

16:34.975 --> 16:35.896
That was a long time ago.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.539
Well, now they're doing the big show when women collect this.

16:38.559 --> 16:39.640
That's what Ruth is doing.

16:40.281 --> 16:43.765
She is putting together a, you should really know about this show.

16:44.626 --> 16:45.527
We don't see Ruth.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.670
It's stupid, but we don't.

16:49.223 --> 16:52.667
Yeah, but they're doing a show of great women collectors.

16:53.388 --> 16:57.833
All of them are deceased, of course.

16:57.853 --> 17:01.537
But anyway, that's... Well, I just thought it had no idea of what we collected.

17:01.557 --> 17:02.518
He's never seen our books.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.040
Well, don't tell anybody now.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.061
Let's keep it quiet.

17:05.422 --> 17:09.647
I want to do some... I will be doing a profile.

17:10.107 --> 17:12.850
I think of this guy, Kirschenbaum.

17:13.010 --> 17:14.372
Kirschenbaum's a new story.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.054
I've known a family connection.

17:16.495 --> 17:16.935
Yeah, but this...
