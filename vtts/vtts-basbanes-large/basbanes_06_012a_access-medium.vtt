00:04.418 --> 00:20.122
In my other job as a book reviewer, I have interviewed perhaps 600 authors over the last four years.

00:20.142 --> 00:22.966
From the beginning, I've had to describe books to me.

00:23.006 --> 00:23.867
How many books do we have?

00:23.887 --> 00:24.669
A thousand?

00:25.009 --> 00:28.975
And obviously, I can't take them all.

00:29.309 --> 00:38.040
But, boy, when you do somebody like Anthony Burgess, or Kennedy, who I like, very good, Joe Welty.

00:38.721 --> 00:39.021
Oh, boy.

00:39.321 --> 00:41.845
This is stuff that's great to have.

00:41.865 --> 00:44.348
It's almost of archival quality.

00:44.488 --> 00:46.070
I guess I'll be asking about that.

00:46.150 --> 00:48.733
Well, it's there.

00:48.773 --> 00:51.777
This stuff is pretty interesting, but this is fun, too.

00:51.797 --> 00:56.683
This is just, Dr. Seary, a kind of...

00:57.946 --> 01:02.553
summary of what this job is for you, I guess.

01:02.573 --> 01:02.673
Sure.

01:02.713 --> 01:08.803
I did an American Library Association as a rare book section that they published annually.

01:08.823 --> 01:11.447
They said the quote of the year was mine.

01:12.729 --> 01:20.481
I said, my coming to the HRC was rather like offering King Midas an opportunity to spend the night in Fort Knox.

01:22.144 --> 01:26.350
Obviously, if you're in modern literature and you're interested

01:26.667 --> 01:35.640
both as a literary critic and scholar, as well as a person who's been deeply engaged in the book world for as long as I have.

01:35.841 --> 01:37.063
This is the mother low.

01:37.123 --> 01:38.044
This is where it is.

01:39.847 --> 01:48.380
My interest is that it combines so many of the things that I'm interested in, obviously the scholarship and the research.

01:48.400 --> 01:54.649
And I think that's extremely important, and I think that that's a direction that the HRC is going to go much further.

01:55.085 --> 02:00.691
I think we're going to play a much more prominent role in research in humanities.

02:02.032 --> 02:12.543
But I also think that the link with the curriculum, the link with what's going on in the graduate programs at the University of Texas.

02:12.563 --> 02:14.525
We are a part of the University of Texas.

02:14.545 --> 02:18.649
We are a part of a major international university.

02:18.669 --> 02:24.315
And for so long, I think people saw UHRC as something discreet, something

02:24.920 --> 02:30.887
even peripheral or something out there that was very important to the university, but it was not really connected.

02:31.187 --> 02:37.675
I think one of the things that I've emphasized here has been that the HRC serves several publics, not just one.

02:37.755 --> 02:41.099
It serves the public of the local Austin community.

02:41.119 --> 02:45.284
We have exhibitions, as you might have seen, World War II exhibitions.

02:45.304 --> 02:48.227
We have a calligraphy exhibition, a book exhibition.

02:48.916 --> 02:56.085
And in Austin, Texas, you don't draw 2,400,000 people as you do at the British Library when you have a major exhibition.

02:56.105 --> 03:02.213
But we do perform an important service, and people come from many places in Texas.

03:02.794 --> 03:04.016
So that's public service.

03:04.036 --> 03:16.712
We also are supportive of the Texas Humanities Commission, and we do things to support those kinds of things, traveling shows, whatever it might be, because we are part of the state, and that's a service.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.782
That's not our most important role, but it is a community.

03:20.802 --> 03:26.269
The second public really has to be concerned that is the public of the university, our own constituencies, the various departments.

03:26.770 --> 03:33.399
We've got to develop important relationships with them and help their scholars who are developing research collections.

03:33.419 --> 03:36.503
We engage in a great deal of dialogue with them.

03:36.664 --> 03:39.468
We are part of the university.

03:39.668 --> 03:47.138
I think the HRC may be profited from its unique relationship to the rest of the university and its directness

03:47.489 --> 03:54.098
with the regents and the presidents and the chancellor and all of that.

03:54.118 --> 03:58.463
But I also think that it was neglected in certain ways by Donald Trump.

03:58.483 --> 04:09.157
He had a great deal to do in terms of technology, in terms of integration with the rest of the system, as it were.

04:09.177 --> 04:14.965
A fork and an extremely important element to the deal is our relationship to our peers.

04:15.704 --> 04:22.713
And our peers are places like the Newberry, the Huntington, the Newark Public, the Burroughs.

04:22.833 --> 04:27.680
These are places that are fundamentally very strong major research institutions.

04:29.042 --> 04:29.642
That's our role.

04:30.624 --> 04:44.462
We certainly, in terms of our collections, when we're going through the Widener, the Beineke, the Houghton, these are obviously the kinds of institutions that we have great affinity with.

04:46.062 --> 05:03.239
And I think it's important for this institution to provide the level of research service, the level of scholarly work that an international humanities research center demands.

05:03.259 --> 05:11.427
And that's where a great deal of our emphasis is going on.

05:11.447 --> 05:13.930
We're also much more eclectic in most places.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.411
I mean, we're not just a library.

05:15.796 --> 05:17.939
85,000 pieces of art.

05:18.559 --> 05:19.941
We have five million photographs.

05:19.961 --> 05:24.046
We have huge film collections.

05:24.607 --> 05:44.571
We are eclectic, and that tremendous variety creates interesting problems for us, but it also allows us to mount exhibitions and interpret collections in ways that a lot of other places would never have, especially in the broad cultural areas and interdisciplinary studies.

05:45.091 --> 05:48.537
I look upon these as opportunities that present difficulties.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.523
That's why we have such a very, very large investment in conservation.

05:52.583 --> 05:56.029
We have one of the largest conservation departments in the country.

05:56.049 --> 05:57.331
That was something to say.

05:57.351 --> 06:06.767
Well, if you have a 20th century collection, if you have 20th century collections, it's a major, major issue because, as you well know, we're talking about yellow dust.

06:06.787 --> 06:11.655
If you can't do something to intervene and preserve and conserve,

06:11.939 --> 06:16.284
We've got to deacidify, and we've got major issues that are coming up.

06:16.304 --> 06:17.265
There was one thing.

06:17.285 --> 06:20.630
We took a little walk through the news like that time.

06:20.650 --> 06:23.373
Well, there's something to walk by, and you can just go on.

06:23.393 --> 06:31.683
Oh, sure, in a morning, and then to walk by, and there's a G's in the middle of a suit.

06:31.703 --> 06:35.868
And as we're walking out, I see, they look like six red ammunition boxes.

06:35.908 --> 06:36.589
I said, what's the name?

06:36.609 --> 06:37.710
He said, well, that's blocking the stuff.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.072
He said, I can't tell you about that.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.073
He asked that all about it.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.264
We have some restricted material.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.165
Restricted in what sense?

06:44.185 --> 06:44.666
By the donors.

06:46.128 --> 06:48.431
In other words, they're not allowed.

06:49.112 --> 06:50.755
They're sealed for a certain food.

06:50.775 --> 06:50.835
Ah.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.779
That's not unusual.

06:53.799 --> 06:54.921
No, it's not.

06:54.941 --> 06:59.908
But it's not something of which I'm comfortable with, which I'm comfortable with.

06:59.928 --> 07:09.823
But I was asked by someone, and I thought about this when I looked at restricted material in himself, and as one person in the profession said,

07:10.394 --> 07:20.228
You're sitting there and you see this material, and your choice is, do you get it or do you not get it?

07:20.248 --> 07:25.716
It's a harder choice than one thing, but I still don't like the idea of sealed material.

07:26.498 --> 07:29.822
Is that proper material?

07:29.842 --> 07:30.924
In this case, yes.

07:30.944 --> 07:39.777
I'm not asking you to betray anything, but... are these stipulations laid out by the family, or by the...

07:40.280 --> 07:45.245
For reasons that make sense?

07:45.805 --> 07:49.389
Well, for reasons that make sense to them.

07:51.451 --> 07:52.212
I understand.

07:52.352 --> 07:53.693
Now, I didn't buy this material.

07:53.713 --> 07:55.315
This was bought 20-some years ago.

07:55.335 --> 07:56.476
And it's still sealed.

07:56.496 --> 08:01.441
Some of it, it will come out of sealed this year.

08:01.461 --> 08:04.183
Is it, but Henry, do you know the character of the comics?

08:04.984 --> 08:06.966
I know some of them.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.307
And it is, in fact, sealed.

08:08.327 --> 08:08.888
Nobody gets answered.

08:08.908 --> 08:09.388
That's right.

08:09.408 --> 08:09.949
It's sealed.

08:10.688 --> 08:15.273
Sealed with the old, remember those old freight train seals?

08:15.293 --> 08:16.895
It's sealed.

08:16.915 --> 08:19.058
That's interesting.

08:19.078 --> 08:21.581
It's kind of like impounding material at the end.

08:21.601 --> 08:25.085
Well, is it libelist stuff, or is it just sensitive?

08:25.105 --> 08:25.906
Oh, I don't know.

08:27.468 --> 08:33.154
I would venture to say that it's not libelist.

08:33.174 --> 08:35.177
People have reasons.

08:35.197 --> 08:37.600
You've been following the Stephen Joyce controversies.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.582
I mean, what is your position on this?

08:40.321 --> 08:48.631
My position is that a family has every right to make the decisions that they want to make regarding the material.

08:49.572 --> 08:55.720
We have every right to make the decision of whether we're going to purchase it or not under those restrictions.

08:55.740 --> 08:58.803
It becomes a matter of negotiation.

08:58.823 --> 08:59.825
There are materials.

09:00.906 --> 09:05.532
The issue with living writers, I have great sympathy for them.

09:05.552 --> 09:09.957
But if you're going to restrict something into perpetuity, the only thing in the library becomes is a warehouse.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.281
And we've got enough space, but we can't afford warehouse space.

09:14.301 --> 09:17.604
You're assuming the stuff is that significant?

09:18.565 --> 09:19.666
You'd rather not, do you?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.749
But that's a craft journey.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.029
Sure.

09:22.049 --> 09:30.698
But if it's Scott Fitzgerald's paper, or William Farnham's, or James Joyce's, you'd go to Josh.

09:31.599 --> 09:36.805
One other thing, you were quoted in that Library Journal piece that you mentioned,

09:37.223 --> 09:43.510
He said, you would recommend to any young collectors starting today to start with the writers of his home generation.

09:43.530 --> 09:45.673
Yeah, I was talking to somebody about that the other day.

09:45.693 --> 09:57.787
I'm increasingly convinced that, and I certainly did this, and for a variety of reasons, you're closer to that culture when you begin collecting.

09:57.988 --> 10:02.573
You're close to the culture of the writers, the contemporary of that culture.

10:03.380 --> 10:08.285
The second reason is just the sheer economics of it.

10:08.565 --> 10:09.366
I couldn't afford it.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.809
How many people collect?

10:12.369 --> 10:17.454
You need to collect writers or themes that really interest you.

10:17.514 --> 10:20.858
I don't think, I mean, otherwise you're in it for speculation.

10:21.118 --> 10:30.147
I can see where some people invest in the art market.

10:30.785 --> 10:34.931
Maybe that's one thing or another.

10:36.253 --> 10:44.184
But the books, I think it's important to be a reader in a collection.

10:45.446 --> 10:46.548
To know your collection.

10:46.568 --> 10:47.569
Yeah.

10:47.589 --> 10:53.698
That's why I was saying yesterday, it gave me such a kick to watch you become a collector.

10:53.718 --> 10:54.920
Oh, with the joys.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.241
Oh, wonderful.

10:56.261 --> 10:59.246
I've collected privately a number of things.

10:59.266 --> 11:00.167
I collect World War I.

11:00.434 --> 11:03.497
for example, and I had some luck.

11:03.517 --> 11:10.926
And remember when I was a kid collecting in the 50s, 60s, there were still things out there.

11:10.946 --> 11:16.332
I mean, the world wasn't as networked where everybody knew what was available, what wasn't available.

11:16.372 --> 11:17.213
You could still find things.

11:17.273 --> 11:22.218
I can still remember going to the Green Gables and picking up that Eric Gill over there for $25.

11:23.179 --> 11:24.741
You still find things out there.

11:25.262 --> 11:28.085
Yeah, yeah, you still can.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.226
You still can, but it's tough.

11:29.459 --> 11:32.822
Larry McMurtry has a character in Cadillac Jack.

11:32.882 --> 11:34.064
Yeah, Cadillac Jack.

11:34.744 --> 11:38.809
Zach Jenks, one of the pieces I sent to him, quote, is, anything can be anywhere.

11:39.629 --> 11:41.271
That's right.

11:41.291 --> 11:41.391
Yeah.

11:41.772 --> 11:47.117
My point is, it's a lot easier to collect writers if you've been out in the last 10 years than it is to collect yours.

11:47.177 --> 11:47.978
I know right now.

11:48.098 --> 11:51.922
I write a little poem where I recommend books to buy right now, but it'd be an issue.

11:51.942 --> 11:52.142
Sure.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.924
By the right collectible authors.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.045
Anything Anne Tyler writes,

11:55.396 --> 12:00.001
She's remarkably good.

12:00.361 --> 12:03.985
Remarkably good and remarkably flexible.

12:04.325 --> 12:06.567
Margaret Atwood's good program.

12:07.669 --> 12:08.169
You what?

12:08.189 --> 12:12.714
I have interviewed Margaret Atwood.

12:14.115 --> 12:16.518
She's Canadian.

12:17.459 --> 12:19.180
They both had best sellers in the United States.

12:19.481 --> 12:21.102
That's amazing.

12:21.122 --> 12:23.665
It was really amazing when they got 10% of the population.

12:23.999 --> 12:31.347
There are some good Canadian artists, like Lou McLennan, 25 years ago, I don't know what his reputation is now.

12:31.368 --> 12:32.469
Of course, more Italian before that.

12:33.810 --> 12:34.992
Some interesting artists.

12:35.012 --> 12:52.572
You made one other comment a year ago, but you did say something about, you know, when you are collecting living people, contemporary people, you know, there's a 10% chance, or whatever that thing is, that sometimes people kind of watch out.

12:53.075 --> 12:57.280
And you said, but even then, it's not a worthless sacrifice.

12:57.621 --> 13:09.756
Well, you know, one way in which you define a genius in the world of literature is someone that goes beyond his or her generation.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.020
The real greatness is eccentric.

13:14.061 --> 13:19.588
But on the other hand, sometimes the best way to study a particular period

13:19.923 --> 13:24.830
is not to see the genius whose time is much larger.

13:25.031 --> 13:32.442
The very limitations of the minor writer is perhaps because they're so tightly connected to their century, or to their decade, or to their lifetime.

13:32.903 --> 13:39.733
And so we frequently get a better picture of the period from the minor writer.

13:40.294 --> 13:48.867
So from a point of view of history, these people are willing to seem to collect in that they reflect the culture of their immediate time.

13:49.285 --> 13:52.370
They're all so important to collect from the point of view of publishing history.

13:52.390 --> 13:57.617
Well, I think it's good to have representative books from the period.

13:57.637 --> 14:04.908
Somebody's going to do a kind of sociology of the bestseller, of the book trade, the book industry, how the books are made.

14:04.928 --> 14:09.635
I mean, you know, everybody thinks that the Gutenberg Bibles down there is some kind of a monument.

14:09.655 --> 14:15.364
Most of the people who come and study the Gutenberg Bible study the ink, the paper, the printing, hundreds of things.

14:15.444 --> 14:18.128
Many of the people who study it are not interested at all in the theology.

14:18.395 --> 14:24.885
In fact, the edition that it's translated from is not necessarily a very fine edition of text.

14:24.905 --> 14:29.011
It's not very textually very important.

14:29.211 --> 14:37.603
So, you know, we don't, we who are collectors, and we are people who build these collections, we don't set the agenda for scholars.

14:37.623 --> 14:39.606
A library is a place of discovery.

14:40.007 --> 14:42.030
It's not a place of pronouncements.

14:42.050 --> 14:43.592
You get into a place like this,

14:44.095 --> 14:50.144
frequently, the very collection you've bought, scholars are going to find reasons in there and things in there that you never thought were close to it.

14:51.546 --> 14:58.196
I was talking to Jeffrey Selznick here the other day, after the Selznick collection.

14:58.216 --> 15:00.760
He said, well, he said, you know, I think they'll be doing this or doing that.

15:00.860 --> 15:05.788
I said, Jeffrey, you don't know what people are going to find in that collection.

15:05.808 --> 15:07.791
People are going to work on things in that collection.

15:08.024 --> 15:13.272
that you, your father, anybody connected with us never had any idea what it was about.

15:13.292 --> 15:14.333
And that's what it is.

15:14.353 --> 15:20.682
I mean, after all, the reason we're in this business is the process of discovery, the whole issue of the way in which we interpret a culture.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.964
That's what we do in the humanities.

15:22.425 --> 15:33.120
And we're merely providing the kinds of raw materials, if you will, which are, you know, really the residue of the imagination, the remains of the imagination,

15:33.488 --> 15:36.072
And that's our record of recording.

15:36.092 --> 15:37.394
And so people study it.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.355
And that's what we're about.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.679
I'll give you one quote, and then we'll leave on that.

15:40.799 --> 15:45.546
But Roger Kennedy, he's a friend of mine.

15:45.566 --> 15:52.135
He was just talking to him recently in his new book on Greek Revival Architecture.

15:52.155 --> 15:53.678
But we were talking about his collections.

15:53.698 --> 15:56.862
He said, he was just talking about what he does.

15:56.882 --> 16:02.230
He said, you know, I am as fascinated, perhaps even more fascinated by junk.

16:02.699 --> 16:03.921
by the junk of it.

16:06.947 --> 16:12.237
Because if you look just at the masterpiece, you don't know what led up to the masterpiece.

16:12.778 --> 16:21.354
If you look around the landscape, if you look at the things that were described, but also the things that were built upon it, then you understand the masterpiece better.

16:21.374 --> 16:21.775
Absolutely.

16:21.795 --> 16:23.298
I think that's precisely what you're saying.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.560
Yeah, it's precisely that.

16:24.601 --> 16:25.382
I mean, the context.

16:26.054 --> 16:29.639
in which the scholars work is important.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.621
We're trying to provide a view of the A's.

16:31.641 --> 16:34.084
I mean, we're trying to provide a broader understanding.

16:34.104 --> 16:47.641
Sure, it's great to have all Graham-Breen's material even was material here, and they are obviously people of, you know, the second generation of writers of the 20th century that are extremely important, Shaw and earlier, or whatever.

16:47.742 --> 16:55.251
But I am not at all worried about the investment they were making in the post-50s,

16:55.602 --> 17:14.429
Furthermore, you know, the material that is available from the younger writers, if you wait for the jury to come back in, you're going to pay a premium that escalates so rapidly that, sure, you're not taking any risk, but you're paying for nothing.

17:14.489 --> 17:17.053
And then on the other hand, if you go along with literary fashion,

17:17.472 --> 17:21.376
You know, you'd throw out the Melville.

17:21.396 --> 17:21.936
Sure.

17:21.956 --> 17:24.338
Who was totally rejected his whole lifetime.

17:24.398 --> 17:35.348
I mean, 1928, they found Billy Gladden and all of a sudden... Oh, we have papers here of people that might not be studied in the next 20 years, but they'll probably be studied later.

17:35.368 --> 17:36.129
I don't doubt that.

17:36.249 --> 17:37.410
But that's your job.

17:37.530 --> 17:38.531
To make that study.

17:38.551 --> 17:39.172
Yeah, that's right.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.193
And to make it available.

17:41.213 --> 17:46.298
You see, the other thing that I get such a great kick out of you is that I teach a seminar in the spring.

17:47.729 --> 18:04.755
And the feeling that comes on these young students who have been studying literature for six or seven years, and undergraduates and non-graduates, and, my God, I'm reading letters that James Joyce wrote in his hand.

18:04.775 --> 18:06.818
I'm reading his manuscripts.

18:06.838 --> 18:07.499
What is this?

18:07.519 --> 18:11.765
This is, as one person, as a kid said, it blows my mind.

18:11.845 --> 18:13.287
I feel the electricity.

18:13.408 --> 18:16.352
And you get these kids, let me do something else.

18:17.868 --> 18:35.391
You read a letter that's just been discovered, like a Falken letter, and someone will read that letter.

18:35.411 --> 18:40.718
Except for the sender of the letter, or certainly whatever, this might be, I might be the first voice that ever read Falken.

18:40.738 --> 18:42.781
It's the first time it's ever been written, or it's, you know, read aloud.

18:42.801 --> 18:43.862
I mean, that's a scary thing.

18:43.882 --> 18:44.303
Everybody's kidding.

18:44.323 --> 18:47.487
And then you get this sense of an original material

18:47.787 --> 18:57.437
There's no critics poured over, never been read about the book, and all of a sudden I'm making migrations.

18:57.457 --> 19:00.219
There's some material here of Eliot who's .

19:00.260 --> 19:05.184
This was Eliot's publisher, trying to get some other person to write material.

19:05.204 --> 19:08.167
So that's a view of Eliot that isn't even in his biographies or something.

19:08.187 --> 19:09.329
I'm going to write about that.

19:09.349 --> 19:15.735
So, you know, there is this, you know, the great thrill of all this is a wonderful thing.

19:16.677 --> 19:21.043
It's a fascinating thing.

19:22.204 --> 19:22.925
That's all right.

19:23.626 --> 19:24.447
Is there anything else?

19:24.507 --> 19:27.070
Now, remind Ray, and I'll get you a couple of those.

19:27.231 --> 19:39.246
Do you know where this was aired at all?

19:39.266 --> 19:42.070
I might even say so.

19:42.610 --> 19:46.115
That's why Jet Light British Solid comes in their new book.

19:46.135 --> 19:46.195
Ah!

19:46.462 --> 19:59.008
Nothing small-scale in Texas.

19:59.028 --> 20:04.419
The Humanities Research Center, the HRC, stored 9 million modern literary manuscripts.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.626
The British holdings alone...

20:08.770 --> 20:27.420
... ... ... ... ...

20:27.772 --> 20:45.714
I don't think it's my business to disseminate what would be as interesting as a scholar and what works as a scholar.

20:45.734 --> 20:46.575
We have to get a certain amount of effort.

20:46.595 --> 20:47.316
We find that it's really impossible.

20:47.336 --> 20:50.580
Only way that I can get scholars to decide is that how scholars can get the first and the first.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.883
And then ultimately, what would be as immediate interest and what would be as interesting beyond our lifetime?

20:52.903 --> 20:54.825
I myself, I don't think it's a significant amount of interest between viewers and others.

20:55.615 --> 21:18.231
Now, I think that, Dr. Miller, you thought it's related to the writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing, then he was writing.

21:18.211 --> 21:46.054
Good morning, my guest.

21:46.075 --> 21:46.395
Have a good day.

21:47.320 --> 22:06.905
For most people, we didn't know the effect that hit the headlines in 1956.

22:06.925 --> 22:12.312
When a man climbed this wide attack, he found this shot then to 13 people with a high-powered rifle.

22:12.412 --> 22:14.334
And often, the news comes down.

22:14.354 --> 22:15.876
It starts to become less separate and valid.

22:16.750 --> 22:35.521
Nonetheless, back in 1957, he must have seen the non-rightly trace that Harry Lenton's of service and language was allowed, to mind a lot of Yale or Oxford.

22:35.541 --> 22:36.202
His successor was the first time.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.828
His father's judicial collecting hands would have been rather detailed, because what it seems to do would have had potential needs to be effective.

22:39.848 --> 22:41.010
Nevertheless, he was prepared to get him again at 3 a.m.

22:41.030 --> 22:41.931
one morning, he made the...

22:42.569 --> 23:07.339
is not the beginning of the literary process, but rather the end.

23:07.359 --> 23:08.641
And that the reading is what the facts are really preliminarily.

23:08.661 --> 23:12.205
The author's note is collected notes, and then it's collected in the files, and then it's collected in the files, and then it's collected in the papers, and then after the book.

23:12.590 --> 23:36.966
who have developed a style of structure, which while there's been many manuscripts saved in the world by people, take their copies, the beginning of a full new series of complete author's archives to start the development of this project in the world.

23:36.986 --> 23:40.892
The University of Texas has a bright edge over often in there, it ends with an oil well, so writers learn from their times and even their way to think about it,

23:41.260 --> 23:42.901
with anything that's at my time.

23:47.183 --> 24:16.279
Christopher Bigsby, he was the person who narrated this whole thing?

24:16.445 --> 24:35.280
Michael Holloway, yes.

24:35.260 --> 24:52.044
And the whole regions are unlikely, especially if they're connected to the British.

24:52.064 --> 24:54.788
For example, there's a tremendous question derived from the British license, and that's the reason I have it.

24:57.805 --> 25:15.062
I think there are five networks of the manuscript of George from which are John Bowles on the Island that we have in the collection.

25:15.082 --> 25:17.484
And this is the original manuscript of John Bowles on the Island.

25:17.745 --> 25:22.890
And then it's the Sidney Conway, a popular, and I think that's it.

25:22.910 --> 25:25.112
I think this is the case that's definitely in the first century edition

25:25.295 --> 25:42.418
I believe that's right.

25:42.438 --> 25:49.668
We can still request a similar publication on a case-by-case basis, but the general policy is that we deserve a secondary publication, or anything that's been there entirely.

25:49.688 --> 25:52.151
Because the wrong way people won't come to Texas if they can actually clear to tell that that's what we need to do.

25:52.171 --> 25:52.692
So it's all we need to do.

25:52.712 --> 25:54.795
I have seen actually the difference of all four years in life, except

25:55.568 --> 26:12.965
The result was, I had spent longer there, and it was much more expensive, and that would be the second I had in the first of the book.

26:12.985 --> 26:14.488
But it was master before, because those mentors still want a lot of action.

26:15.093 --> 26:25.404
It shows some of the pages written by a child.

26:25.704 --> 26:28.947
It shows 35 pages on free trade.

26:29.328 --> 26:38.217
What it shows is that his trade and his politics were part of the same attitude.

26:38.377 --> 26:42.020
And it shows how his marriage supported it.

26:43.062 --> 26:44.543
And what is also happening is the

26:45.113 --> 26:56.215
documents, notes, correspondence surrounding us.

26:56.235 --> 27:03.790
And it's about revisions, about the personal, about costumes, designs, correspondence with actors, I guess, .

27:03.810 --> 27:05.894
So what can I now get a little bit of all of that?

27:05.914 --> 27:07.577
Well, we know that what we're here, we know it's a .

27:13.396 --> 27:20.974
There's another amazing incident for that.

27:21.074 --> 27:30.477
When a person was asked by the VVC, he did an advance ambituary of charge, and he was having a pain.

27:30.457 --> 27:38.394
when Cha died, and he handed it over to Cha, perhaps because he's just gotten so used to doing that for Cha's review.

27:38.414 --> 27:46.491
And Cha, I think unaware that he was reading his editorial, has changed part of the text to begin the great career which has just come to

27:46.471 --> 28:10.058
Sure, Mr. Peniel, a man, who not only had half an eye on posterity, but had also determined that posterity should think all the difficult to think.

28:11.199 --> 28:13.862
Even more, another writer, who won't be told against it,

28:14.163 --> 28:21.296
It's been not the general people thought of him, even when he was alive.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.021
And of course, even more, he didn't really achieve so much of this.

28:24.041 --> 28:24.562
Heckle Davies.

28:24.582 --> 28:24.702
Where?

28:25.764 --> 28:38.567
I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean, of course, I mean,

28:39.644 --> 29:03.477
I went back to the war diary, and I was named for war scholar, and I had an artist off there myself.

29:03.497 --> 29:06.782
I was rising the shelves once around me, and I wouldn't say bought the leftist, straight to the English, because it was in London, so you have this one.

29:08.551 --> 29:27.634
The fact is that there's nothing in the court, which is like anybody.

29:30.116 --> 29:30.637
But there might have been.

29:30.657 --> 29:33.781
And whenever that is himself and my copycat, the information, the letters like that, then you can't authorize it at all.

29:33.801 --> 29:34.862
So what does that mean to be quite like or published?

29:36.260 --> 29:49.357
Another person who was used in the U.S.

29:49.377 --> 29:53.943
was still colony.

29:53.963 --> 29:54.644
Colony had a life-long friendship.

29:54.664 --> 29:55.204
He wrote a life-long enemy.

29:55.224 --> 30:01.272
And war played by a certain type of colony, which is rather contemptible, and regarded as it was represented in the most foolish side of what interests you like, not as a transitoral.

30:01.690 --> 30:19.834
At the end of World War II, Charlie published Young, Quiet, Brave.

30:20.255 --> 30:25.101
And we went through the text a few afterwards there.

30:25.121 --> 30:26.864
We found war was properly on the shelf there.

30:26.884 --> 30:27.865
We opened it.

30:27.885 --> 30:29.547
Now, although war is attacked, it opens things, and it's a very foolish view of it.

30:29.567 --> 30:30.389
Charlie always seeks to be a war admirer.

30:30.409 --> 30:30.769
And we opened that

30:35.575 --> 30:42.069
This is Gerald Carley, which Ron has very heavily annotated.

30:42.089 --> 30:48.102
And he asked himself at the beginning, why should I be interested in reading this book at all?

30:48.122 --> 30:52.892
And answered, because Gerald Carley was a typical man of my generation, and I think he was very much concerned with himself.

30:52.872 --> 30:58.742
under-representative of this case.

30:59.724 --> 31:11.505
The comparisons involve complementary, clear in response to something that Connors has written to lash out and cleave me out, where did he pick up these nations and include elements of that in response.

31:11.688 --> 31:26.449
Yes, we have lost personal libraries.

31:26.469 --> 31:31.356
And there is evidence that this relationship is still another one of the contemporaries there.

31:31.376 --> 31:37.104
And that Graham Greene presented almost entire library which is lost to law, nicely inscribing many of the bodies.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.568
I think they have quite a relaxed relationship and they're very fond of one another, as you can tell from the description.

31:39.548 --> 31:48.929
And the third man, this man may be reaching to the bridesmaid.

31:49.030 --> 31:49.471
It's pretty awesome.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.175
This is the first question that comes to mind.

31:52.036 --> 31:55.785
My mind is, what does it refer to the bridesmaid and the third man?

31:55.985 --> 32:22.067
It's always a matter of time.

32:22.087 --> 32:24.649
I think it's already been proven in a number of years ago.

32:24.669 --> 32:25.350
It's a very comprehensive for what

32:26.410 --> 32:30.035
and comprehensive anywhere.

32:30.136 --> 32:37.807
We're looking at the ones for the first volume of the large portion of the jewel in the crown.

32:37.947 --> 32:44.157
It begins with brief notes on small bits of paper and goes through holographs, notebooks, typescripts, typescripts, page 3.

32:44.177 --> 32:48.203
In this particular notebook, he's sort of commanding himself to begin writing with golf.

32:48.223 --> 32:49.445
Just get done here.

32:49.465 --> 32:51.708
You've made enough notes about what you think you might want to do.

32:51.728 --> 32:52.890
Now start writing.

32:53.393 --> 33:11.006
We were fortunate in being able to acquire these manuscripts to compose about what we were still living, so he could make a little note for us, putting up in to where ideas fit into the sequence of the entire novel.

33:11.026 --> 33:13.090
Here he's written that the minute he was as an officer is really the very first idea he wrote down

33:14.504 --> 33:28.210
This is the story of a rape.

33:28.443 --> 33:57.451
with the events that led up to it and followed it in a situation which it happened.

33:57.471 --> 33:58.332
We have a shot here of a steer.

33:59.138 --> 34:22.639
So long as good copies are kept in the country of politics, I would be in favor of that internationally.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.643
Because what we know is the context, not the magical regimen.

34:33.766 --> 34:40.778
Today, Texas is spending much of its money conserving what it's got.

34:40.878 --> 34:51.737
With the arrival of the word processor and the floppy disk, the days when you could follow the growth of a novel or a kind in photographic paper may anyway be gone forever.

34:51.757 --> 34:58.609
But meanwhile, carefully preserved in the air-conditioned vaults of the University of Texas are some very familiar parts of British culture.

35:01.323 --> 35:11.773
Goodbye, Mr. Dior.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.095
Mind you, don't you turn away, little kiddo.

35:14.115 --> 35:16.698
You'd be a merry-go-rounder.

35:17.418 --> 35:26.807
People would say, quite little kiddos and brains is really wanting to know.

35:26.827 --> 35:27.108
Well, goodbye.

35:27.128 --> 35:27.848
Christopher Biggs was in Texas.

35:27.868 --> 35:29.490
In her earlier novels, like The War Between the Caves,

35:34.212 --> 35:48.245
I didn't say that.

35:48.385 --> 35:50.547
Tell me what we're looking at, Roy.

35:51.408 --> 36:03.780
Well, in this case, you're looking at the world's first permanent photograph made by Joseph Misevorniep in 1826, or possibly 1827.

36:03.997 --> 36:08.102
It was made on a pewter plate with a brief exposure of eight hours.

36:09.383 --> 36:20.635
And it is the single image formed in camera on the pewter plate, which was the material that held the sensitized emulsion in it, and then processed that even by him.

36:20.655 --> 36:27.483
And the fixed image is a view from his third-story window of the outbuildings of his estate in France.

36:27.503 --> 36:29.125
Texas acquired this how?

36:29.145 --> 36:30.726
It was part of the Gernstein collection.

36:30.746 --> 36:33.810
It was purchased in 1963.

36:33.830 --> 36:33.970
Uh-huh.

36:34.658 --> 36:59.080
we're looking at is the gutenberg bible photography in your response response was that only more so because there are a number of gutenberg bibles there's only one first photograph this is probably closer to your gutenberg bible this is the world's first photographically illustrated book the pencil of nature by william henry fox talbot which exists in a couple of dozen examples we have one complete set

36:59.988 --> 37:04.334
We have some things here that you're going to do.

37:04.354 --> 37:05.575
A bit of the history of it.

37:06.396 --> 37:10.021
What would you say that would be worth in the open market?

37:10.201 --> 37:14.928
Nothing to compare it with, they don't know.

37:14.948 --> 37:16.570
They put a price on the first, but it's a unique.

37:17.431 --> 37:20.275
But it's unique.

37:20.295 --> 37:20.715
It's wonderful, yeah.

37:21.236 --> 37:23.159
And Mr. Gernstein talked to Dan.

37:23.179 --> 37:23.879
He just told it.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.542
It took him years to find it.

37:25.742 --> 37:26.783
Is that a story?

37:26.923 --> 37:27.985
It's in there.

37:28.085 --> 37:29.607
Is it in there?

37:29.823 --> 37:35.849
He spent years trying to figure out where it was and found it through the family of later purchases.

37:38.252 --> 37:38.912
He did the work for it.

37:38.992 --> 37:40.274
He was a good detective.

37:40.294 --> 37:45.999
Let me show you a little bit of the archive.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.901
Excuse me, where once again are we now?

37:48.041 --> 37:49.083
What would you call this?

37:49.103 --> 37:50.804
This is the equipment archive.

37:52.006 --> 37:58.412
We have about 3,000 pieces of photographic apparatus from the 19th and 20th century.

37:59.084 --> 38:11.903
For example, the first roll film camera from 1888.

38:11.963 --> 38:15.409
You cross the button, we do the rest camera.

38:15.889 --> 38:18.413
How does this assist the star?

38:18.493 --> 38:19.675
Ooh, that's great.

38:19.895 --> 38:20.176
Isn't that?

38:20.196 --> 38:22.399
That's a cane.

38:22.419 --> 38:23.260
Is that American?

38:23.561 --> 38:25.103
That's French, actually.

38:25.123 --> 38:28.348
The American ones were done like this one was designed to be like a pocket watch.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.290
There's another in here that's like a binocular.

38:31.971 --> 38:35.996
How would you say this is useful to scholars?

38:36.056 --> 38:40.001
I mean, is this a museum archive here?

38:40.021 --> 38:53.058
Well, any time you deal with objects beyond just literary, you're dealing with objects which are, in one degree or another, have a museum generative basis, and so you have objects of various natures and various applications.

38:53.078 --> 38:58.825
In the case of the equipment, it is often the people who are researching different styles of camera design work

38:59.429 --> 39:02.052
are people who are using it in a supplementary fashion.

39:02.072 --> 39:06.057
What type of camera took this type of picture?

39:06.337 --> 39:10.462
So both functions are, I think, important to have for the equipment.

39:10.482 --> 39:14.226
In the case of the prints and photographs, of course, it runs the opposite direction.

39:14.306 --> 39:20.012
Is this a fine created art piece, or is it a photograph documenting some person or something again?

39:20.032 --> 39:27.681
Either one of those flexible adaptations is a medium that came to the use.

39:28.184 --> 39:29.045
turn of the century.

39:29.566 --> 39:32.870
What is the earliest camera you had?

39:32.890 --> 39:39.760
Probably a pre-photographic camera, the camera on Spiro, which was used for sketching in the late 1700s.

39:39.980 --> 39:45.267
Do you have the type of device which made that first photograph?

39:45.287 --> 39:53.078
I have something similar to it out in the case, the early de Garakhoff camera, which is essentially a large wooden box camera.

39:53.632 --> 40:03.603
which had a lens opening and a place to place the slide with the synthesized plate in it.

40:03.623 --> 40:06.646
How did he make the print from the pewter plate?

40:07.708 --> 40:09.650
How did he make a print from that?

40:09.690 --> 40:11.091
He didn't.

40:11.111 --> 40:13.094
He just had the single image on the pewter plate.

40:13.634 --> 40:16.197
In modern-day terms, we photograph that plate.

40:17.155 --> 40:22.423
artificially increased the density of the image by increasing the development.

40:22.483 --> 40:28.211
I think the final print was actually pre-identified negative sandwiched together to further increase the density.

40:28.231 --> 40:34.521
It probably never looked as contrast as it does on the copy print right there.

40:34.541 --> 40:45.036
The interesting thing about that first photograph is that when it was exhibited in the 1890s, some people said, what a brilliant stunning image, and other people recorded it as saying they couldn't see a thing.

40:45.775 --> 40:49.501
Even back then, we have discrepancies as to what it looked like.

40:50.041 --> 40:51.263
Has anyone tried it?

40:51.303 --> 40:51.784
Does it work?

40:52.886 --> 40:53.667
I have not, no.

40:53.687 --> 40:55.330
Do we learn films for any of these things?

40:56.531 --> 40:57.192
Take the movie.

40:57.212 --> 41:01.699
There have been a couple of examples where we have committed people to learn films, too, yeah, but very rarely.

41:03.983 --> 41:09.151
We've tried to preserve in the present.

41:09.171 --> 41:10.112
It's been a lot very different.

41:15.256 --> 41:30.071
The reference library, which currently is about 25,000 volumes now.

41:30.091 --> 41:30.632
And then the print archive.

41:31.186 --> 41:46.629
There's all the small formats.

41:50.715 --> 41:56.224
The literary files all on the east wall over there.

41:56.244 --> 41:59.168
Any time that the statement of the season war or somebody come in, the photographs are separated.

41:59.519 --> 42:11.940
So these are related to the literary stuff.

42:12.301 --> 42:25.003
That was one of the recent discoveries in which Kerensky turned out to be, his father was a school official at the 20th century in Russia.

42:25.388 --> 42:33.199
in the area of Pashtun, in the Asian area, where they're actually having some troubles now.

42:33.219 --> 42:36.083
And these are some pictures that he collected from the late 1890s of the natives of that area.

42:36.103 --> 42:42.833
And look at all of the photographs from the Alfred A. Kuhnock collection.

42:44.575 --> 42:49.843
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, fourteen.

42:49.863 --> 42:51.345
Oh boy, if I go on a nine, nine, fifteen, fifteen,

42:53.080 --> 43:03.530
Are these pictures that he shot himself?

43:03.570 --> 43:04.411
Yeah, everything.

43:04.431 --> 43:06.613
Could you just take one out of family snapshots?

43:07.253 --> 43:08.535
They could be family snapshots.

43:08.575 --> 43:11.497
They could be working professional photographers.

43:11.537 --> 43:12.278
We'll have to just see.

43:13.419 --> 43:16.002
Emotional shot of him, young, with the boys always.

43:17.323 --> 43:22.868
A more professional portrait of, let's say,

43:23.945 --> 43:42.148
I am convinced pretty much in terms of photographs and often do the value of the photographic illustration and probably doing anything out in terms of photographs.

43:42.168 --> 43:43.810
He also did some amateur work himself, too.

43:46.473 --> 43:52.779
Other people have strong associations.

43:52.800 --> 43:57.264
The Shaw photographs down there, for example.

43:57.284 --> 44:03.911
He, for years, worked with a very famous British photographer and Frederick Evans.

44:03.931 --> 44:05.212
He was also a book dealer.

44:05.232 --> 44:09.276
And Frederick Evans actually printed some of Shaw's negatives very long ago.

44:09.297 --> 44:09.377
D.H.

44:09.397 --> 44:09.577
Lawrence.

44:09.597 --> 44:09.677
D.H.

44:09.697 --> 44:10.558
Lawrence is a very strong visual authority.

44:10.578 --> 44:11.038
Cotton Lake, of course.

44:11.058 --> 44:12.700
He was found throughout the facility.

44:13.878 --> 44:20.288
Earl Stanley Gardner was another person who certainly dabbled in photography as well.

44:20.408 --> 44:24.955
We have a number of stereo views.

44:24.975 --> 44:25.576
Probably 10 cents a day still.

44:25.596 --> 44:30.604
Unidentified photographer's box.

44:30.624 --> 44:34.430
It's always something we don't know yet.

44:34.450 --> 44:34.810
I will find it.

44:34.830 --> 44:35.171
Maybe here.

44:35.371 --> 44:35.852
Here you go.

44:42.329 --> 44:59.090
Yes, but again, this is my non-publication.

44:59.110 --> 44:59.411
We're browsing.

44:59.431 --> 45:09.704
We're trying to find out what they're interested in, what they want to do, what they want to research, and see what we can help them with.

45:09.724 --> 45:11.526
No, we try to accommodate as best we can when we're reaching the stage

45:18.121 --> 45:25.929
We'd like to know that's how many of this is possible.

45:26.269 --> 45:34.838
One of the rare and nicer pieces in the collection is in Grinsheim's collection, five original albums compiled by Lewis Peele, who was an amateur.

45:34.918 --> 45:36.940
He was, actually.

45:36.960 --> 45:42.006
And so one of these original compositions of his.

45:42.026 --> 45:43.487
In fact, it's, you know,

45:45.020 --> 45:47.383
And it's everything from family and associates to friends.

45:47.483 --> 45:51.850
I think he was one of the most talented portraitists, so sweet.

45:51.930 --> 45:56.796
Even though he considered himself an amateur.

45:57.197 --> 45:58.799
Lighting himself an amateur.

45:58.819 --> 45:59.400
He's a bachelor.

45:59.420 --> 46:04.527
I wonder, is Alice Liddell in there?

46:05.509 --> 46:08.713
She's not in this album, but I do have about three photographs of her.

46:08.733 --> 46:13.660
Contrary to the Walt Disney cartoon, she is not

46:14.163 --> 46:20.933
the girl with long blonde hair.

46:21.013 --> 46:24.779
But she was quite better than it.

46:24.879 --> 46:28.044
There were more popular models that used to be family than I was.

46:28.064 --> 46:28.825
She was quite taken by Alice, don't I?

46:28.845 --> 46:29.045
Oh, yes.

46:29.065 --> 46:39.040
There were many women, which include everything from books and literature about the theater, the screenplay, to

46:39.863 --> 46:58.506
Norman Valgette's original set design, industrial design, material, costume design, all biographical files of different artists, and performing artists.

46:58.526 --> 47:01.569
I should point out how a naked artist is doing that.

47:01.589 --> 47:04.333
And try to keep it clean so we can find the one next time we need to use it.

47:04.353 --> 47:08.638
And you run into a biography file, you can pull it out and find any sort of individual who was into performing arts for any sort of way.

47:11.588 --> 47:33.794
So it's in this case.

47:33.814 --> 47:34.836
Actors or director of the form are you looking for?

47:34.856 --> 47:35.416
Yeah, it was a great moment.

47:35.436 --> 47:36.938
And we're all very white and white and white and white and white and white.

47:43.550 --> 47:47.794
This is the MGM maps for different films.

47:47.815 --> 48:05.453
The actual artist map that we used to be photographed with the action, superimposed with the action to sort of give the effect of the whole city.

48:05.473 --> 48:05.593
Hello.

48:05.613 --> 48:08.356
Is there a fire?

48:08.857 --> 48:08.997
No.

48:09.097 --> 48:09.878
I'm sorry.

48:09.978 --> 48:11.920
Daddy's set designs there.

48:12.119 --> 48:15.783
We saw the marionettes, by the way, yesterday.

48:15.803 --> 48:18.065
Okay, then you said, all right.

48:18.085 --> 48:19.386
There goes my big finish.

48:19.666 --> 48:26.233
Anyway, and then there's a whole room up here with the Feldman papers.

48:26.293 --> 48:27.514
Did they show you that?

48:27.534 --> 48:28.175
Ah, they didn't.

48:28.415 --> 48:33.220
But I think we better go see the deal.

48:33.240 --> 48:33.900
Yes, you must.

48:36.843 --> 48:37.764
How long have you been here?

48:37.844 --> 48:38.565
Have you been with us?

48:39.001 --> 48:41.166
May as well get you on campus.

48:41.586 --> 48:42.288
Oh, right, yes.

48:42.308 --> 48:43.951
Also, that dates me to do that.

48:43.971 --> 48:52.569
Yes, I came to the university first as a Fulbright Extension student in 1965, and then again in 1962.

48:55.035 --> 48:56.538
So you've been here.

48:56.558 --> 48:56.638
Yes.

48:57.378 --> 49:08.617
I came the first time, you know.

49:08.657 --> 49:12.984
But you were here really when the whole HRC concept was?

49:13.124 --> 49:13.705
Exactly.

49:13.765 --> 49:19.234
In fact, I met Ransominen at that time, although perhaps I was.

49:19.720 --> 49:29.663
But then when I did it, it was very interesting.

49:30.638 --> 49:48.876
And then I went back to my university there, where we always had professors from different countries coming to teach languages.

49:48.896 --> 49:54.902
And it just so happened that for about a year after I was first, Professor Robert came to New York, who was, you know, .

49:54.922 --> 49:55.743
So I knew always from the very beginning.

49:55.763 --> 50:00.207
And in fact, the idea of my coming back in 1952 with an audition

50:00.187 --> 50:21.235
was that I could do some research in American literature, you know, in this material where I didn't see me, and this is an exciting part of it, and so in that time I had done this job before, couldn't do it, not started, so I was teaching in the U.S.

50:21.255 --> 50:22.937
language department, that was there, and I thought it was an interesting part of it.

50:22.917 --> 50:37.686
Were you impressed by Dr. Ransom?

50:37.987 --> 50:40.532
Yes, I was.

50:40.832 --> 50:43.137
I was very much impressed.

50:43.302 --> 51:02.095
Also, I remember the fact that it was very important, especially now looking back.

51:02.115 --> 51:04.539
I was very young when I came, the best time when I was really quite young when I came to teach a person like Dr. Anthony.

51:04.559 --> 51:06.643
I wouldn't say to have some of your piano ideas, but to have some respect on the culture, which was more

51:06.623 --> 51:33.662
And he, you know, was urging me to do my research.

51:33.682 --> 51:35.905
And even the truth of this was the fact that, yes, Ransom was a very easy person to establish a new contractor.

51:36.374 --> 52:00.069
if the idea that people are suggesting or talking about .

52:00.089 --> 52:02.253
I believe that still for some people here, it was really difficult for them to grasp what they wanted to do.

52:02.273 --> 52:03.875
But I am still very much in thinking of the kind of thinking about .

52:03.895 --> 52:04.276
And that's what I .

52:04.296 --> 52:04.716
Can you mention that?

52:04.736 --> 52:05.858
Yes, because you see,

52:06.040 --> 52:10.305
He was able to foresee.

52:10.325 --> 52:21.818
He was able to look ahead.

52:21.898 --> 52:28.146
He had this vision.

52:28.166 --> 52:28.846
So I was very impressed with that.

52:28.866 --> 52:33.091
And I was very grateful to really do something for him and with him.

52:33.111 --> 52:33.732
So at the beginning, was that .

52:33.752 --> 52:34.273
So that's what I came for.

52:34.293 --> 52:34.613
And that's why .

52:34.593 --> 52:40.345
The tower at that time, right?

52:40.365 --> 52:41.768
Yes, the tower, exactly.

52:41.848 --> 52:44.393
And of course I was, you know, delighted to see that.

52:44.413 --> 52:53.812
We were, in fact, Dr. Robert, who asked me to see that, and she started saying, you must come back, you must come back, you must come here, you know.

52:53.832 --> 52:55.335
And so, I would say, this connection

52:55.687 --> 53:18.606
and this relationship that it has for me sort of did not allow me to see some of the, let's say, kind of the seeds of some problem that could develop later if all we were going to talk about

53:18.586 --> 53:28.283
It was possible to develop the things at that time, because of that moment, because that year he had that view.

53:28.304 --> 53:35.557
It was just a very good, fertile moment for the female to happen.

53:35.577 --> 53:36.358
And so it was.

53:36.727 --> 53:50.375
The thing that, and as I said, you know, the discussion we had in his office, and he was the kind of person that I really enjoyed talking with because of his project, and also because his project in the moment were possible, they were happening.

53:51.377 --> 53:56.828
But we must keep in mind that those were different moments, and we had different people in the moment.

53:57.567 --> 54:04.322
As I say, it is kind of a hindsight decision.

54:04.462 --> 54:08.150
At that time, I thought, yes, everything was possible.

54:08.170 --> 54:10.155
Well, time changed.

54:10.175 --> 54:13.602
So in looking back, I think that the only

54:13.582 --> 54:31.850
I don't know for your sake, but the only thing that I always think about, that kind of person, cannot even mention, cannot even think.

54:31.870 --> 54:36.897
The moment this period ends, we have to look back to something else.

54:36.917 --> 54:40.062
And we were a young university, a young

54:40.548 --> 54:52.329
So I cannot really blame anybody for saying, aha, why are you doing that?

54:52.349 --> 54:53.551
You're a European.

54:55.594 --> 55:00.042
How did you feel about coming to Texas?

55:00.292 --> 55:18.133
It's French, especially the first time.

55:18.153 --> 55:18.613
But I didn't even know.

55:18.633 --> 55:19.394
I mean, the food room, you don't know.

55:19.414 --> 55:20.876
So when I announced that you were telling me the text of it, I said, why?

55:20.896 --> 55:21.777
And of course, in the history of it's a lot.

55:21.993 --> 55:40.241
But in the program, especially with .

55:40.261 --> 55:40.682
And that is Spanish .

55:40.702 --> 55:41.042
And that was my .

55:41.062 --> 55:41.503
And then, of course, .

55:41.483 --> 55:54.700
And I still...

55:55.000 --> 55:58.406
would not get into the reality system.

55:58.426 --> 55:59.909
You don't.

55:59.929 --> 56:06.480
You really can when you are young and when you are leading this period.

56:06.661 --> 56:07.061
You really can.

56:07.081 --> 56:07.883
But there's nothing.

56:07.903 --> 56:14.054
Any moment that you are put down with the answer, or the same as people who are being done in the marriage, maybe the children, and others, or if this is not going to be left forever, just think about the future.

56:14.074 --> 56:14.815
Yeah, let's talk about that.

56:14.795 --> 56:39.417
So what sometimes people look back today and ask, the people who are not the other thing, the people who do not know, the people who do not understand what they do, today they say that they are, you know, visionaries, you know, what do they do?

56:39.437 --> 56:40.298
I think it's the wrong one of those things.

56:40.318 --> 56:42.760
We, they knew there was an anthropologist at that time, and the idea of the things that changed so hard on their minds,

56:42.740 --> 56:52.779
But, no, you could not become more realistic, just like asking a 20-year-old to become really sick and sick in terms of the future.

56:52.799 --> 56:53.360
You really can't.

56:53.921 --> 57:05.302
And because, sure, there are a lot of things that I could have done in my own situation, but I didn't even think about it.

57:05.322 --> 57:05.622
Neither at all.

57:05.642 --> 57:06.203
I really don't have an idea.

57:06.223 --> 57:06.604
Let's do it.

57:07.208 --> 57:21.758
But then, you know,

57:23.020 --> 57:28.226
We dealt with those problems the best way we could, and that had been many.

57:28.246 --> 57:37.857
But to me, it's still, I mean, we are receiving a legacy of that, and the people of them have left to us.

57:37.997 --> 57:48.409
And my community legacy, there are some problems that we have today, because things cannot go on in the same time, always in a different way, naturally.

57:48.429 --> 57:51.593
So if they kind of let the rain, we lost it to a short time.

57:51.758 --> 58:14.501
But personally, I have been very satisfied and very happy for, in my own personal life, the way I have been, for adapting myself and adapting to this time.

58:14.521 --> 58:16.723
Because more than adapting, it's just keeping the flexibility and really believing the way we approach people.

58:16.743 --> 58:17.884
And I would have done it by everything in my own Germany.

58:18.185 --> 58:45.255
But the thing that made it worth it,

58:45.235 --> 58:57.620
in the academic environment is the things that I was offered to do, that I had the opportunity to land it.

58:57.640 --> 59:02.890
Something should be done that I just had it that very thing.

59:03.764 --> 59:12.513
These kind of opportunities I would not have had.

59:14.135 --> 59:18.759
Because at that time, when I left with the .

59:18.779 --> 59:28.189
I got my degree, very good compared to the other ones, a lot of dissertations in the American literature.

59:28.329 --> 59:28.710
I was in my mind.

59:28.810 --> 59:31.172
There would have been no idea, no push, no inspiration for the literature.

59:31.574 --> 59:34.180
So that's the kind of thing that I actually feel very much.

59:34.200 --> 59:38.912
Well, do you think you could have found it elsewhere in the States, or was it pretty unusual?

59:38.932 --> 59:39.413
Oh, yes.

59:39.433 --> 59:42.501
No, I think I could have found that in the States.

59:42.521 --> 59:44.005
I think it was an American artist.

59:44.025 --> 59:47.052
It developed a different way in the States.

59:47.335 --> 01:00:05.693
Maybe in a place like , there are some that have an easier atmosphere for this intellectual development.

01:00:05.713 --> 01:00:06.274
There is more of that there.

01:00:06.294 --> 01:00:07.757
But on the other hand, I think that's something.

01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:11.766
give up something and take something.

01:00:17.232 --> 01:00:19.114
But I think it's very important to consider, and I see that when I collect it all the time.

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:36.934
I feel like I'm closer to the younger generation, because only now, because of the age 20 or 30, I'm beginning to do the things that I have been allowed, that I have allowed myself, that I have thrown myself into, you know.

01:00:37.184 --> 01:00:39.130
But that is something that is very important.

01:00:39.972 --> 01:00:45.709
Whether later on, you know, problems, abilities, and things kind of on the way to stop it.
