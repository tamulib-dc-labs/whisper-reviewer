00:03.659 --> 00:05.841
I'm going to talk to Doris Lessing in New York.

00:09.325 --> 00:11.168
Congratulations on this wonderful book.

00:11.628 --> 00:12.890
I look forward to volume two.

00:12.910 --> 00:20.398
And I wonder where you have written so much, you have put so much of yourself into your fiction.

00:21.419 --> 00:22.160
Let's just start.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.662
Let's kind of enter the conversation.

00:24.603 --> 00:29.929
Why did you feel the necessity of writing an autobiography, two volumes of memoirs?

00:29.949 --> 00:33.253
Well, it puts Doris in perspective.

00:33.273 --> 00:33.413
I know.

00:33.916 --> 00:40.924
People are always so interested in whether novels are autobiographical or not.

00:42.145 --> 00:44.247
A continual query, is that true?

00:44.307 --> 00:44.868
Is that true?

00:45.529 --> 00:58.023
So I thought I'd get that record clear, because I think like Martha Quest, for example, is supposed to be totally autobiographical, and of course it isn't.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.028
I'm very interested in how you integrate

01:03.380 --> 01:05.542
the creation of certain books in the novel.

01:05.562 --> 01:08.164
Well, this you used, and this book.

01:08.184 --> 01:10.186
This you used, and that book.

01:10.747 --> 01:18.133
You did mention on page 28 that there was a book you were working on, which was an attempt at an autobiography, and that nobody was interested in that.

01:20.235 --> 01:21.656
Tell me a little bit about that.

01:21.676 --> 01:23.638
Is this kind of a continuation of that?

01:23.738 --> 01:24.239
Oh, no.

01:24.539 --> 01:25.159
It was a different.

01:26.260 --> 01:31.345
I read a book called Memoirs of a Survivor, which I thought I'd write

01:31.882 --> 01:38.773
It originally started with the idea of writing an autobiography in dreams, because I dream a lot.

01:39.554 --> 01:45.964
And I had this idea in my mind for years, and then I realised I was never going to do it because it was such a mammoth of undertaking.

01:45.984 --> 01:56.059
So I thought, when I was a survivor, I used dreams, two different kinds, both personal and sort of archetypal dreams.

01:57.401 --> 02:00.606
I called it an attempt at autobiography in metaphor.

02:01.210 --> 02:07.340
But nobody was interested in it, save the publishers just left it off, the book, altogether.

02:08.582 --> 02:18.257
Now, you do suggest, without necessarily saying it, I'll write it a number of times in the book, that this really is not the higher calling.

02:18.277 --> 02:24.126
I mean, this kind of writing is not the higher calling for a writer, I mean, non-fiction.

02:25.028 --> 02:26.049
I don't think I said that.

02:26.089 --> 02:29.074
What interests me is that... You suggest it, I think, is what I said.

02:30.033 --> 02:48.959
The most interesting question is why is it that a piece of writing that has not one fact in it can nevertheless be more true than something which is factual, because the atmosphere is right, or the flavour is right.

02:49.960 --> 02:58.572
Like there are whole scenes in Master Quest which are not factual, but nevertheless they are more true

02:59.632 --> 03:02.256
In essence, you describe that.

03:02.336 --> 03:04.459
I don't know why.

03:05.981 --> 03:20.761
Lisa Alfa has been quoted as saying, and I have a quote here, because I took so many pages of notes to find my own notes, but she said, almost every woman author I know acknowledges a debt to Doris Lessing.

03:21.181 --> 03:28.491
I wonder how you respond to that, and what do you suppose she means by that, in terms of the debt to Doris Lessing?

03:30.158 --> 03:35.425
Well, you see, I see that as literature is a great continuum, isn't it?

03:35.646 --> 03:36.427
We all owe debts.

03:36.908 --> 03:40.473
I owe debts to a lot of writers.

03:40.533 --> 03:46.061
I don't see only women writers, you understand, because I don't think like that.

03:47.062 --> 03:56.515
But I think it was the Golden Notebook, I think she was talking about, which did have a great influence in its time.

03:57.717 --> 03:59.640
That was 1962.

03:59.660 --> 03:59.760
Yeah.

04:00.702 --> 04:14.883
It isn't only women that is in front, because now I get, it's surprising how often I get letters from men saying something like this, I read this book and I've given it to my wife, I've given this book to my girlfriend.

04:14.923 --> 04:17.747
I mean, this is really an interesting development.

04:17.887 --> 04:22.874
I had one, I'm sorry.

04:22.894 --> 04:23.775
We lost our three.

04:24.156 --> 04:27.621
Yes, right, I lost my, you brought your back there.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.985
You know, sometimes it's not.

04:35.065 --> 04:39.391
I love the quote, and I just picked quotes out of Randall, that being a novelist is not a chronicler.

04:39.411 --> 04:43.878
And I think that was going back to what you were saying earlier.

04:43.898 --> 04:46.361
I mean, in terms of why you strive for the truth on the one hand.

04:47.002 --> 04:49.886
This is terrible about my black sister.

04:49.907 --> 04:52.630
Do you want me to ask them to bring something to mend them?

04:52.791 --> 04:53.251
No.

04:53.331 --> 04:54.353
You know what it needs?

04:54.373 --> 04:55.334
It means a pen.

04:55.354 --> 04:57.037
I was just taking them out of my pocket.

04:57.077 --> 04:57.758
No, I understand.

04:57.838 --> 04:59.300
It happens so quickly.

04:59.320 --> 04:59.440
Yes.

04:59.621 --> 05:00.782
Do you have a side piece?

05:00.802 --> 05:01.303
Yes, I do.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.812
of anything like that.

05:05.832 --> 05:06.994
Sorry, it's very annoying.

05:07.054 --> 05:09.617
It's terrible trying to read in the concert.

05:09.997 --> 05:16.164
I guess we were talking about there was a review in the Boston Globe.

05:16.184 --> 05:18.647
Did you see the review of your book in the Boston Globe?

05:18.908 --> 05:21.010
There's a woman by the name of Vivian Warnick.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.031
I don't know her at all.

05:22.051 --> 05:23.293
I think she's a New York writer.

05:25.435 --> 05:30.000
I guess she is reviewing the book as a contemporary feminist.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.442
I think that there's kind of some

05:32.941 --> 05:41.411
unease about your putting quotation marks around the word attitude in this.

05:41.431 --> 05:42.052
In this book.

05:42.072 --> 05:44.114
In this book, yeah.

05:44.134 --> 05:47.238
She uses the word waspishness.

05:47.258 --> 05:48.159
That's what she sees.

05:49.681 --> 05:52.144
Does it concern you at all?

05:52.164 --> 06:02.897
I mean, do you feel that you are kind of in sync with, and you certainly have something to say about this generation and the generation in which you came to raise, but this generation of

06:03.383 --> 06:05.947
so-called feminist writers.

06:08.010 --> 06:15.481
Well, you see, I can't, and I start talking about feminism because it's an enormous subject, you know.

06:16.322 --> 06:20.869
In fact, what she says is, you seem to dismiss the current crop of feminists.

06:20.889 --> 06:22.171
That's basically a direct point.

06:22.191 --> 06:24.715
Okay, well, I'm very out of sympathizing with them.

06:25.616 --> 06:31.365
I'm, like many women in my generation, I'm terribly disappointed because

06:31.666 --> 06:42.219
The 1960s explosion of feminism had so much energy behind it, and it's all been putted away in talk as far as I'm concerned.

06:42.299 --> 06:43.861
Most of it's been putted away.

06:45.664 --> 06:59.361
What has happened is that a number of white middle-class women in America and Europe have very much bettered their condition, but they haven't touched

06:59.712 --> 07:28.369
working-class women or women in the third world and I think it was a very much badly structured movement and you know feminism was not invented in the 60s women in my generation spent a lot of time wondering how to improve things and to see this enormous energy just going to waste and squabble or complaining about men

07:29.125 --> 07:36.313
or what's going on now, this ridiculous rubbish about taking men to court for paying them a compliment.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.055
It is so embarrassing.

07:38.535 --> 07:39.697
And it is such a waste.

07:39.757 --> 07:49.407
And in the meantime, if you know what's going on in the third world, I mean, how badly women need something serious.

07:50.889 --> 07:51.990
Well, it's heartbreaking.

07:52.230 --> 07:55.033
So now I haven't got much time for the current feminist.

07:55.314 --> 07:58.457
When I was young, I had what is now called a role model.

07:58.893 --> 08:04.498
This is Gladys Marsdorff, who was the lady mayoress of Salisbury Southern Revision.

08:04.978 --> 08:12.925
And she used to hear us young women talking, and she used to say, girls, don't waste your time and all that, she says.

08:13.005 --> 08:23.634
What you need is equal paper, equal work, equal opportunity, that means equal training, equal education, and you need good nursery schools and kindergartens.

08:24.095 --> 08:27.718
Until you've got that, she said, don't waste my time with all that waffle.

08:28.019 --> 08:51.394
and nothing i have seen of the feminists in the 60s has made me change my mind that is the essence of feminism i think yeah you want to get the legal structure right don't sit around gossiping about don't set me off it makes me so sad what happened there's a wonderful line in there um you talk about your son your first child

08:51.965 --> 08:55.089
Today, he would be called hyperactive, you say.

08:55.109 --> 08:57.032
I mean, that word didn't even exist then.

08:57.653 --> 08:59.255
And I suppose he would be sedated.

08:59.616 --> 09:08.588
Again, you know, I mean, mothers of a different generation cope with an active child today or a bunch of child.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.392
And they said, you have no idea, I mean, you must have it.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.855
How many children are actually sedated today?

09:13.995 --> 09:19.903
I mean, because it's not convenient for the parents, not just the mother, I guess.

09:19.923 --> 09:21.786
And it's kind of a very depressing thing.

09:22.441 --> 09:50.693
this concept what there wasn't an existence of hyperactivity we'd never heard the phrase he was just a very physically robust child and god knows he was but i mean you give us these little lines yeah they're little comments yeah and i guess that when you when you were structuring the book i mean you could have really just focused on the time but you couldn't you couldn't resist jumping ahead to comment i mean you even comment on

09:51.398 --> 09:57.764
what's going on today in former Yugoslavia and all sorts of political events.

09:58.024 --> 10:00.026
I don't see why I should have to.

10:00.046 --> 10:01.207
I mean, I'm writing it now.

10:01.227 --> 10:03.589
I'm looking back on my life from this perspective.

10:04.070 --> 10:10.656
You say also that it would be a different book if you waited to write it at the age of 85.

10:10.676 --> 10:11.977
Or at the age of 50.

10:12.017 --> 10:12.918
At the age of 50.

10:13.298 --> 10:14.459
Yeah.

10:14.479 --> 10:17.602
So memory, you invoke the phrase of memory.

10:17.622 --> 10:20.545
I wonder if this is really an exploration

10:21.267 --> 10:26.593
for you with the whole concept of memory that this book is.

10:26.653 --> 10:35.122
I just see the phrase memory and it is used in any number of different guises in the book.

10:35.643 --> 10:38.045
You mentioned also that you kept a very detailed diary.

10:39.407 --> 10:45.013
You said that when you were young you kept a charm.

10:46.343 --> 10:47.544
I never come to jail.

10:47.704 --> 10:50.107
I think that, well, I'll have to find a place.

10:50.347 --> 10:51.849
You said that you were not orderly.

10:51.869 --> 10:53.931
You were talking about when you were taking care of it.

10:53.951 --> 10:57.054
No, no, I said, I don't know what it is.

10:57.074 --> 11:03.520
I said, this kind of obsessiveness is useful for keeping diaries, which I've been keeping for the last 20 years.

11:04.101 --> 11:05.602
I didn't keep one when I was young.

11:05.662 --> 11:06.103
I see.

11:06.123 --> 11:06.543
I'm sorry.

11:06.563 --> 11:08.745
Obviously, you have kept them for the last 20 years.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.288
So you really did crawl upon memory head.

11:12.179 --> 11:21.551
Well, I spent a long amount of time thinking about memories, thoughts I've never had before at all, because the more you think about it, the more astonishing memory is.

11:25.436 --> 11:29.921
We all know now that memories can be implanted in you by your parents.

11:30.282 --> 11:31.744
I mean, there's no doubt about that.

11:31.864 --> 11:40.735
A parent says, oh, do you remember, darling, how we always used to go to Brighton and you loved to make sandcastles?

11:41.575 --> 11:43.177
And here's a picture of you.

11:43.899 --> 11:46.262
And then the child starts remembering this kind of thing.

11:47.043 --> 11:51.190
So memory is very slippery and very creative.

11:53.313 --> 12:01.225
So I rely on the early part of that book for memories I really can vouch for that I know are true.

12:01.245 --> 12:06.934
And to have them as precisely accurate as you can get them is very important to you, I gather.

12:06.974 --> 12:08.697
Well it was then, you see, because

12:09.588 --> 12:14.674
One of my earliest memories is of saying to myself, now look, this is what happened.

12:15.175 --> 12:15.776
Remember it.

12:16.076 --> 12:18.239
Don't let them talk you out of it.

12:18.799 --> 12:23.905
So I have these very, very precise moments.

12:24.867 --> 12:27.950
For years I used to go back and say, well, are you still intact?

12:28.211 --> 12:31.815
Obviously it was important to me.

12:33.415 --> 12:38.382
It's amazing to me how important, you basically educated yourself in books.

12:38.422 --> 12:43.469
I've just written a book which will be published next year.

12:43.489 --> 12:46.633
It's titled The Gentle Madness and There's a Love and Passion for Books.

12:46.653 --> 12:48.976
It's in real mania, actually.

12:48.996 --> 12:54.123
And you have so many different, you visit a house where there are a thousand books.

12:54.264 --> 12:57.268
And it's just so bejractical.

12:57.929 --> 12:58.950
Tell me a little bit about

12:59.842 --> 13:02.785
this passion for reading and how it has developed.

13:02.965 --> 13:11.372
I'd be very curious how books, I mean, it's a silly question I suppose, but clearly you are silly.

13:11.633 --> 13:17.698
Apparently you've educated yourself in your own reading program and how it has shaped you as a writer.

13:19.159 --> 13:28.768
Well, in the bookcase, bookcases in what was virtually an elongated mud hut were all the English classics.

13:29.086 --> 13:33.232
So I read them from a very early age, because that's what they want to read.

13:33.272 --> 13:38.840
And then my mother got amazing books she ordered.

13:39.100 --> 13:54.863
You know, when you think, you know, you have to stand to England for them, that order went by sea, and then they came out by sea, and then they came by train up to buy, and then they came by train to bank it, and then they came by ox wagon to the farm.

13:56.104 --> 13:58.688
And all these extraordinary books she ordered for us.

13:59.157 --> 14:02.961
And a great adventure they were to me.

14:04.163 --> 14:13.854
I think very often children who perhaps are under pressure take to reading as a kind of support.

14:16.037 --> 14:24.827
Well, there's a book review in today's New York Times, today's Times, about, I mean, it just traces how illiterate we're getting.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.629
I know we're getting illiterate.

14:26.649 --> 14:27.530
It's quite terrifying.

14:27.590 --> 14:29.973
And it's quite terrifying.

14:29.993 --> 14:39.225
It is interesting that for something of an epigraph you choose this commentary on population growth in Africa.

14:39.265 --> 14:42.108
Yes, I know it sounds a bit... No, the thing was this.

14:42.288 --> 14:53.903
When this manuscript went in to the publishers and the readers, they all without exception said, on page 20 you say the population is half a million, and on page 30 you say,

14:54.119 --> 15:10.143
I mean, you just think that in a world, you know, this exponential growth of population wasn't necessary when to spell it out, but I've spelled it out so that this in itself is a sign of illiteracy, it seems to me, that I should need to.

15:10.263 --> 15:16.152
But I wonder why the appropriateness of putting that at the very front of the book, I thought it might have had some special significance to that.

15:16.592 --> 15:19.857
Well, it does have a political point, because...

15:20.292 --> 15:29.042
People forget that when the... You know, this is about the British occupation of Rhodesia, this background to this book.

15:29.583 --> 15:37.452
People don't seem to know that when the British arrived, there were a quarter million blacks in that whole territory, which is the size of Spain.

15:38.914 --> 15:43.359
And now the number you basically projected, it's... They think it is 12 million.

15:44.079 --> 15:48.865
And they say that it's going to treble by 2010.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.960
I mean, if that's true, it's a tragedy, believe me.

15:52.000 --> 16:02.035
So in a bizarrely ironic way, the Westerner is responsible for this out-of-control multiplication of the population?

16:02.235 --> 16:06.141
You mentioned how the cultivation of maize... Well, I think that's it.

16:06.161 --> 16:07.223
I never realized that.

16:07.303 --> 16:08.565
That's fascinating.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.287
The Portuguese introduced it.

16:10.307 --> 16:12.811
You know, there are so many theories about this.

16:12.831 --> 16:16.877
There are as many theories as there are people, experts.

16:17.127 --> 16:22.873
The easy one is to say that Western medicine has stopped so many babies dying.

16:23.473 --> 16:24.875
But they had a medicine, you know.

16:26.496 --> 16:34.825
And the other one is, well, they had all these droughts and famines, but they did in fact have a pretty efficient system of storing grain.

16:35.185 --> 16:44.434
But now, they say, it's because they had very small, sparse grains before, and maize, as you know, is a very fat,

16:44.988 --> 16:47.392
nourishing, easily to grow.

16:47.832 --> 16:48.273
And store.

16:48.453 --> 16:58.328
Yes, and they think it's, one of the theories is that it's because the Portuguese introduced maize, and this has become the food for the whole of Southern Africa.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.392
Excuse me.

17:02.153 --> 17:09.544
Do you, when you've written such a, in fact, my 12-year-old daughter asked me today, who are you into doing daddy in?

17:09.929 --> 17:16.657
And I told her Doris Blessing, and she said, she has read your story through the tunnel, which we read together.

17:16.897 --> 17:22.804
And it's amazing how many children had read that particular story.

17:22.884 --> 17:27.930
So you really have a body of readers that is vast.

17:28.010 --> 17:30.773
I mean, it just crosses all kinds of age groups.

17:30.793 --> 17:39.143
I wonder, when you're writing, when you're beginning the creative process, is there a reader that you have to write?

17:39.646 --> 17:40.908
Never has been.

17:40.948 --> 17:47.575
I'm always concerned with getting it right in terms of what I'm trying to do.

17:47.596 --> 17:52.541
You have a story or whatever it is.

17:53.783 --> 17:55.405
It's an interesting question in itself.

17:55.465 --> 17:59.049
What is this form that we need?

18:01.192 --> 18:02.513
I'm trying to get that right.

18:02.874 --> 18:08.100
And I'm trying not to think of possible reactions because then you can get very scared, you know.

18:08.587 --> 18:15.214
because several times I have known that I'm being abrasive, and I try not to think about it.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.678
Do you write to entertain?

18:19.959 --> 18:20.900
No, I write.

18:23.162 --> 18:27.987
You know, you're going to the roots of everything when you ask that question.

18:28.328 --> 18:31.852
I don't know how to answer it.

18:31.872 --> 18:36.096
I think writers like me are always trying to find out

18:37.730 --> 18:39.212
something, whatever it is.

18:39.232 --> 18:42.036
When you write a book, you're finding out.

18:42.677 --> 18:45.361
It's a discovery process.

18:45.381 --> 18:48.645
So to go back to an earlier question, it is an explanation.

18:48.665 --> 18:49.286
Yeah, it is.

18:50.888 --> 18:57.778
It's very exciting when you start a book because you know you're going to know very much more when you've finished it than when you started it.

18:58.159 --> 19:01.724
Do you know basically where you're headed when you start?

19:01.744 --> 19:02.645
I have a story.

19:02.665 --> 19:07.652
I have roughly the characters that sometimes one or two will creep in.

19:08.543 --> 19:13.607
And I have the tone, which is the most important thing of all, the tone of voice.

19:14.268 --> 19:19.873
But I know that ideas are going to come to my head that I haven't got at the moment.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.395
They're going to be new ideas, new insights.

19:22.955 --> 19:26.058
Now, you just said you don't write to entertain.

19:27.379 --> 19:28.980
Well, I'm delighted if I entertain.

19:29.020 --> 19:30.642
But of course you do, as you know.

19:30.702 --> 19:38.348
The writer certainly does have a mandate to engage this reader out there, whoever she or he may be.

19:38.885 --> 19:47.015
And I know so many authors who have political agendas to promote.

19:47.095 --> 19:50.199
I mean, in fiction, generally fail.

19:50.779 --> 19:55.425
And I find that so many wonderful writers become too politicized.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.127
You've avoided that.

19:57.508 --> 20:00.371
You've not allowed that to happen, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

20:00.731 --> 20:06.158
I mean, you certainly have very strong beliefs and ideas and other things that you wanted to say about the human tradition.

20:06.762 --> 20:11.709
and you have chosen to do it through the form of the novel and fiction.

20:11.729 --> 20:16.335
How do you walk that fine line from being too didactic in it?

20:17.918 --> 20:22.424
Because I'm always writing about experience.

20:22.444 --> 20:23.105
Is that a clear question?

20:23.125 --> 20:24.106
No, no, it's fine.

20:24.767 --> 20:28.112
Because what I'm doing is to write out of experience.

20:28.833 --> 20:33.259
And when you're doing that, you're writing from your solar plexus, as it were,

20:33.560 --> 20:36.663
Whereas if you are writing didactically or writing on the top of the head.

20:36.984 --> 20:42.489
Now, for example, I once wrote a purely polemical book.

20:42.790 --> 20:46.433
It's called The Sentimental Agents of Valian.

20:46.574 --> 20:49.597
It's in my cannabis in August.

20:49.617 --> 20:54.141
And it's a deliberately polemical book.

20:55.303 --> 20:57.205
It's social satire.

20:58.105 --> 21:00.148
And it's got two-dimensional characters.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.470
And it's about rhetoric.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.622
political rhetoric and making fun of it.

21:05.363 --> 21:06.945
Now that is the only time I've done it.

21:07.386 --> 21:08.587
And I know the difference.

21:08.607 --> 21:10.870
I was writing it up here somewhere.

21:12.192 --> 21:15.255
Whereas the other writing comes from, you write it with your whole body.

21:15.716 --> 21:20.942
For the sake of the tape recorder, when you said coming out of here, you were... Top of my head somewhere.

21:20.962 --> 21:23.926
You were grasping your head, meaning your brain as opposed to your heart, I guess.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.127
Not my heart.

21:25.428 --> 21:30.634
You sort of, when you're writing a novel properly,

21:31.508 --> 21:33.531
You were writing with all of yourself.

21:33.551 --> 21:43.404
You were writing with memories and... Ideas is the wrong word.

21:43.824 --> 21:57.803
It's a whole complex of knowledge that you have about the situation on a person, which is very different from the polemical writing which politicos always want you to do, you know.

21:58.964 --> 22:04.472
Which, of course, pleases them, but then you're going to lose the people who read books, too, I think.

22:04.492 --> 22:05.092
Yes, you do.

22:06.294 --> 22:08.958
You've done so much experimentation with form.

22:09.298 --> 22:17.169
Do you kind of get bored if you've done something and it satisfies you?

22:17.249 --> 22:21.996
I mean, it has achieved your expectations of it?

22:22.997 --> 22:26.001
I mean, you mentioned the Cannabis series.

22:26.318 --> 22:32.785
That was really quite a bold departure for you, wasn't it, to go and see the future?

22:33.306 --> 22:34.787
You see, I didn't see it like that.

22:34.868 --> 22:41.014
When I started off, I wasn't thinking that I am writing science fiction.

22:41.034 --> 22:41.735
I didn't know that.

22:41.775 --> 22:43.177
And I noticed I didn't use the phrase.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.079
No, I know, but I wasn't.

22:45.099 --> 22:47.121
I had a different approach.

22:47.141 --> 22:55.110
Somebody said to me, not from our culture, a Muslim, an old friend of mine said, nobody ever...

22:56.120 --> 22:56.961
does the following.

22:56.981 --> 23:01.666
They read the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Apocrypha, and the Koran.

23:02.708 --> 23:06.732
If they did that, they would see that these are stages of the same religion.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.375
It fascinated me, so I did that, of course.

23:09.836 --> 23:14.862
And having done that, I thought, well... You went and read those four books.

23:14.962 --> 23:15.863
Well, they're not four.

23:16.163 --> 23:17.064
The Old Testament.

23:17.144 --> 23:19.687
The Apocrypha is a great mass.

23:20.168 --> 23:20.288
Right.

23:21.078 --> 23:23.961
I mean, you read all those books that you just enumerated.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.304
Yes, in sequence, as the suggested.

23:27.205 --> 23:32.391
And what, they are, it is the same origin, only in different phases, obviously.

23:32.991 --> 23:38.277
So, not of course that one can say this to some passionate Muslim or passionate Jew.

23:38.838 --> 23:45.565
I mean, however, so I thought, what I was interested in was the ideas they have in common.

23:46.166 --> 23:50.511
Because they have many ideas and the same characters in common.

23:51.065 --> 23:56.753
very often, you know, as if this is a great pageant.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.778
I'm not being irreverent, you know.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.501
No, I'm agreeing with you.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.305
And they're the same characters.

24:04.825 --> 24:11.495
And so I thought, how could I use some of these ideas in a book for our time?

24:11.555 --> 24:14.380
And our book for our time is somewhat religious.

24:15.662 --> 24:19.527
One of our Daleks, if you like, is space fiction.

24:19.547 --> 24:20.008
So I thought,

24:21.119 --> 24:24.683
So that's how I wrote Shacasta, but I wasn't planning to write anymore.

24:25.144 --> 24:38.719
And then I got, for some reason or another, that set off some kind of creativity or other, and I wrote marriages between zones 3, 4, and 5, which I'd had in my head for 10 years, and I couldn't solve it.

24:38.799 --> 24:43.525
In that form, or now all of a sudden it made sense to put it into this sequence of books?

24:43.965 --> 24:46.288
Something about it just gelled it.

24:47.209 --> 24:50.012
Something about the idea gelled the whole thing.

24:50.161 --> 24:53.886
But then it clearly belonged in that sequence, though.

24:53.906 --> 24:55.327
Well, it didn't before.

24:55.347 --> 24:56.128
Well, it did.

24:56.188 --> 25:03.918
But when you had embarked upon this, how did it feel to create a whole... I love that whole idea.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.101
And it's yours entirely.

25:06.581 --> 25:07.643
I wouldn't mind writing.

25:07.763 --> 25:11.548
If I am spared, as they say, I think I might try another one.

25:11.568 --> 25:13.270
I think I might do number six.

25:13.290 --> 25:13.570
Really?

25:14.950 --> 25:16.151
You know, I'm getting on a bit.

25:16.191 --> 25:17.252
Time is running out.

25:17.272 --> 25:22.516
We all are.

25:24.298 --> 25:25.539
You mentioned two dimensions.

25:25.999 --> 25:29.903
You created two-dimensional characters.

25:29.923 --> 25:31.424
I wonder if you could just expand a bit on that.

25:31.444 --> 25:36.488
You said this was a two-dimensional exercise.

25:36.508 --> 25:42.613
Well, that is when the characters have no real life.

25:42.653 --> 25:44.755
They're only just embodiments of ideas.

25:45.865 --> 25:59.723
So these characters don't pretend to be real people, like some of Voltaire's, for example, or Bernard Shaw's when he's writing to death.

25:59.743 --> 26:02.326
So this is quite different from a real person.

26:02.346 --> 26:07.012
This is just a person who is illustrating some thesis.

26:08.134 --> 26:12.379
Do you test the vital signs?

26:12.747 --> 26:13.368
of the readers.

26:13.388 --> 26:15.170
I mean, do you hear from people out there?

26:15.190 --> 26:15.991
Do they respond?

26:16.712 --> 26:17.253
Yes, I do.

26:17.293 --> 26:35.816
You see, I get the occasional letter from, even from, you see, I had thought no one had read Sentimental Agents, but I get the occasional letter about that from usually, interestingly, from people who have to teach politics.

26:35.836 --> 26:41.303
And they like making fun of political dogmatism.

26:42.380 --> 26:53.190
I love the concept of the Golden Notebook of exchanging sentences and to have the other person write from there.

26:54.051 --> 26:56.012
Has that been done in your experience?

26:56.092 --> 26:58.354
Have you done it?

26:58.374 --> 27:01.117
Has anything like that ever happened where somebody will give you?

27:01.137 --> 27:01.377
No.

27:01.978 --> 27:02.458
Oh, yes.

27:02.999 --> 27:12.387
I mean, not exactly in that form, you know, but I had the experience once of somebody ringing up and saying, I was in the

27:13.615 --> 27:17.059
casualty department of the Royal Free Hospital, and this happened.

27:18.521 --> 27:25.310
I saw this happen, and it's not my cup of tea, but I think it might be yours, and they dictated to me what they'd seen.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.354
It was turned into a story called Casualty.

27:28.995 --> 27:34.562
The book was called here, The Real Thing.

27:34.822 --> 27:37.626
It's a little story about... I didn't see it.

27:37.646 --> 27:42.492
The writer simply said, I know I'd ever write it, but you probably would.

27:43.552 --> 27:52.502
It's such an amazing concept, because you think of the creative process as being something that really doesn't admit another consciousness.

27:53.083 --> 28:03.775
It has to be all from, you'd think it would be all from one creative spirit, so to speak, but we get a sentence from somebody else and then move with that flow.

28:03.795 --> 28:04.756
It's kind of interesting.

28:05.097 --> 28:07.900
Well, I've never actually done that, but I can imagine it happening.

28:08.961 --> 28:13.086
I mean, I could, if somebody said, I can't remember that sentence,

28:13.437 --> 28:19.867
the moonlight dinted on the rifle of a young recruit on the hillside in Algiers.

28:20.588 --> 28:25.696
If somebody said this to me, my imagination would seize up.

28:25.716 --> 28:28.941
But I can, I know writers who would be instantly off.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.404
Okay, that's how many is the idea.

28:34.729 --> 28:40.198
You mentioned that you have kept a journal or a diary for the last 20 or so years, is that right?

28:40.218 --> 28:41.740
So the next volume,

28:42.125 --> 28:45.069
begins about 1949, I guess.

28:45.089 --> 28:48.493
Yeah, I need to do the 50s because I have a lot of things.

28:49.173 --> 28:51.697
So there will be more than two volumes then?

28:51.717 --> 29:06.074
Well, I need to do, yes, I need to do the two volumes, but after that it becomes really tricky because I can write the 50s okay without really hurting anybody or talking very much about.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.898
But after that it does become difficult.

29:09.918 --> 29:11.220
As we come closer to it.

29:11.622 --> 29:14.967
I assume we're talking about people who are alive.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.672
Is this what you're talking about?

29:17.692 --> 29:17.792
Yeah.

29:18.213 --> 29:27.287
Because even going back in time here, you mentioned, you said, well, let's call him Renee, or let's call him Jasper, or this person.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.732
Well, you see, we're up against children and grandchildren.

29:31.934 --> 29:35.480
And, I mean, who cares what people are called, after all?

29:35.520 --> 29:37.984
That is irrelevant, but I find it

29:38.268 --> 29:42.472
charming that you've chosen to, you know, what isn't a name.

29:46.336 --> 29:56.365
The film director, Ilya Kazan, who lives here in New York, and I interviewed him a couple of years ago on the occasion of his huge autobiography, and he said a very interesting thing.

29:56.786 --> 30:05.454
He said, when you choose to write truthfully about yourself, he said, you have to make yourself naked before the world is directed.

30:05.474 --> 30:06.655
You have to expose yourself

30:07.073 --> 30:15.122
Did you feel similarly, do you think, when it came time to write down about yourself, I mean, that you really have to expose so much of yourself, your inner self?

30:16.223 --> 30:24.992
You see, I was always going to write an autobiography at some point, but this was precipitated because people are starting to write biographies.

30:25.012 --> 30:27.135
You mentioned that five of them at the beginning.

30:27.155 --> 30:30.058
Well, when I started, yes, there were five.

30:30.979 --> 30:33.702
There are two things here.

30:33.822 --> 30:35.764
One is that they tend to be extremely

30:36.031 --> 30:36.792
inaccurate.

30:37.053 --> 30:40.798
So at any rate, there's a background of facts there, right?

30:41.239 --> 30:46.868
The other thing is that... What was the second point?

30:46.908 --> 30:48.069
This is what happens to me now.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.592
It just goes out of my head now.

30:49.612 --> 30:51.395
I think we're talking about exposing ourselves.

30:51.735 --> 30:52.737
Oh yes, right.

30:53.177 --> 30:54.199
Now, this is the point.

30:55.581 --> 31:00.188
I have lived an extremely quiet life and I've never said anything about my life.

31:02.532 --> 31:04.114
As soon as the Bible could start,

31:04.364 --> 31:06.773
They're going to start unearthing all kinds of things.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.045
My leaving two children.

31:10.507 --> 31:11.370
And I thought...
