Hello, I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington, and this is Primetime Radio.

00:10.346 --> 00:15.213
In this edition of our program, we talk with two people who have spent major portions of their careers counseling adults.

00:15.794 --> 00:21.883
Both of them recognize there are particular problems of older Americans that need counseling, and that the need for such counseling is acute.

00:22.303 --> 00:31.837
The problem is that it doesn't seem very glamorous to a lot of counselors, and as in so many other areas of life, the particular problems of older Americans are often assumed to be caused by problems unique to age.

00:32.218 --> 00:34.982
We find out why that isn't necessarily the case.

00:34.962 --> 00:42.415
We also meet a man who's recently written a book about bibliomains, people to whom the book has become more than something to read, has become their whole life.

00:42.435 --> 00:50.790
We talk about Cleopatra, Thomas Jefferson, and Stephen Blumberg, who was such a bibliomain that he stole hundreds of thousands of books from university libraries.

00:51.190 --> 00:56.700
Stay tuned as primetime radio comes your way.

01:11.294 --> 01:15.219
Hello, I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington, and welcome to Primetime Radio.

01:15.739 --> 01:17.661
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

01:17.962 --> 01:20.004
You know she's aging and she's set in her ways.

01:20.324 --> 01:22.507
He's lived so long he thinks he knows it all.

01:22.587 --> 01:23.668
You can't tell him anything.

01:24.329 --> 01:40.828
We spend a lot of time rationalizing and thus avoiding talking with what one of our guests in Primetime Radio today calls third-age people, so much so that government agencies who welcome the young, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the displaced sometimes spend little attention toward older Americans, particularly in the area of counseling.

01:40.808 --> 01:45.493
As we discuss counseling of third-age Americans in this program, we'll discover several interesting things.

01:46.013 --> 01:53.581
Far from being inflexible and set in their ways, a higher percentage of older Americans report success from counseling than from the general population.

01:54.081 --> 02:01.809
Rather than being an entirely separate group because of their age, older Americans often share the same symptoms and reactions to therapy as younger patients.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.753
It does remain true, however, that third-age problems are often unique.

02:05.733 --> 02:15.187
While problems of the ex-generation may be more often associated with lifestyle decisions, the third age decisions and problems revolve around a peaceful enjoyment of the last third of their lives.

02:15.567 --> 02:20.314
Their decisions about lifestyle are more limited by external factors, the choices for the future more constricted.

02:20.915 --> 02:23.539
With two outstanding counselors, we're going to investigate

02:23.519 --> 02:26.644
counseling for older Americans in this edition of Primetime Radio.

02:26.664 --> 02:34.075
And we welcome to our studios here in Washington, Nancy Schlossberg, who is a professor at the University of Maryland in the Department of Counseling and Personnel Services.

02:34.436 --> 02:38.242
She's a specialist in adult transitions and author of several books on the subject.

02:38.762 --> 02:47.696
And on her phone, out to Decatur, Illinois, James Warnick, who's the chief counselor at the Decatur, Illinois Mental Health Center and author of Listening with Different Ears, Counseling People Over 60.

02:48.197 --> 02:50.641
Jim, Nancy, welcome to Primetime Radio.

02:50.901 --> 02:51.502
Good to be here.

02:51.542 --> 02:52.243
Glad to be here.

02:52.713 --> 03:01.165
How different, or let's put it this way, how crucial is age as a determinant in approaching counseling in general?

03:01.206 --> 03:01.506
Nancy?

03:01.987 --> 03:05.292
Well, in my view, it is not the critical variable at all.

03:06.814 --> 03:16.408
In fact, Jim, I'm very eager to talk with you about the title of your book, which is, I believe, Listening with Different Ears Counseling People Over 60.

03:17.317 --> 03:30.334
And the reason I'm interested is because I'm not sure I could differentiate between a 50-year-old person with a chronic illness that's debilitating and a 70-year-old.

03:31.115 --> 03:40.287
Nor could I differentiate between an 80-year-old who just got married and had a great big ball last Friday night to which I went.

03:40.267 --> 03:46.052
and say a 40-year-old who's miserable because she has no relationship.

03:46.132 --> 03:50.776
So I'm not sure that age is the variable in terms of counseling.

03:51.297 --> 04:06.510
Rather, I look at what's going on in the person's life in terms of health, optimism, joie de vivre, and you've got a lot of 80-year-olds and 70-year-olds who've got a lot of that and are still working and not filled with losses.

04:07.050 --> 04:09.332
So I'm concerned about using age.

04:09.392 --> 04:10.273
What do you say, Jim?

04:10.253 --> 04:17.221
Well, of course, I understand exactly what you're saying, and much of the time there is no difference.

04:17.362 --> 04:35.724
But I think that they can kind of be put in a separate group part of the time for several reasons, one of which lots of times the cause of this distress that the people go through, it's situational, you know.

04:36.445 --> 04:39.028
Things happen to them, you know.

04:39.397 --> 04:48.130
coped fairly well most of their life, and then suddenly here they are at, let's say, 68, and they lose a spouse.

04:48.311 --> 04:50.654
Okay, trauma.

04:50.674 --> 04:54.540
Then this means that they've got to start living differently.

04:54.621 --> 04:58.887
Instead of being part of a couple, they are living singularly.

04:59.188 --> 05:04.436
How does that grief, though, differ from the grief that a 40-year-old man would feel if his wife died of cancer?

05:05.017 --> 05:06.619
Okay, I think the

05:07.325 --> 05:13.394
Sometimes the major difference is that you have several things happen at once.

05:13.734 --> 05:25.311
You know, okay, that the man loses his wife from cancer is one situation, but then you have another situation to where the man loses a spouse.

05:26.292 --> 05:36.066
He may to some degree be having a difficult time adjusting to retirement, and then health problems come along.

05:36.383 --> 05:40.649
And this is one of the differentiations.

05:41.229 --> 05:44.073
A lot of things frequently happen at the same time.

05:44.494 --> 05:44.794
Nancy?

05:45.135 --> 05:52.485
Well, I agree with what Jim said, except for the basic assumption that – I mean, how's that?

05:52.505 --> 05:54.627
I agree with everything except your basic assumption.

05:55.348 --> 06:01.817
And what I gather is that you're saying that more things happen to people –

06:01.949 --> 06:04.554
Multiple transitions happen to older people.

06:04.654 --> 06:16.295
Well, in my research of people of all ages, I've done a lot of studies of transitions, one of which not so long ago on people who lost their jobs of all ages.

06:16.796 --> 06:20.102
And they were younger, and there were multiple transitions they were going through.

06:20.122 --> 06:20.903
They were rifts.

06:20.883 --> 06:23.186
Reduction in force, you know, lost their job.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.789
Some of them were getting divorced.

06:25.929 --> 06:28.032
One man's father had just moved in with him.

06:28.052 --> 06:29.293
This is a 35-year-old.

06:29.354 --> 06:33.719
His father had just moved in with him because he had cancer and couldn't care for himself.

06:34.099 --> 06:36.522
His wife had just left to find herself.

06:37.023 --> 06:43.611
And now that he was fired or his job was eliminated, he was part of the theater group of the organization.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.034
He no longer could be part of that theater group.

06:46.054 --> 06:48.618
So everything in his life was shattered.

06:49.038 --> 06:50.620
He was devastated.

06:50.735 --> 06:57.545
Now, there was an older person who had been thinking of retirement, and it wasn't as devastating.

06:57.605 --> 07:05.838
So what I think, Jim, is that you need, or what I've done, at least in my work, is develop a structure for looking at people.

07:06.058 --> 07:14.951
And I grant, if somebody's having multiple transitions at the same time, that's going to really be very traumatic.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.814
But I don't see it as age-related.

07:17.155 --> 07:18.437
That's where I think we differ.

07:18.597 --> 07:18.717
Right.

07:18.848 --> 07:30.259
The only thing that pops into my mind is that, for example, the feeling of grief among older people or the summation of the trauma that we're talking about.

07:30.745 --> 07:36.292
might be different simply because an older person might think there just isn't going to be time enough to recover.

07:36.533 --> 07:37.915
Well, that's a very good point.

07:38.295 --> 07:41.479
I think the time perspective is very important.

07:41.499 --> 07:43.843
And that does, Jim, see, now I'm backtracking.

07:47.387 --> 07:51.172
People's time perspective changes and their view of options.

07:51.633 --> 07:55.798
Now, very often, it's your view of how much time you have left to live.

07:56.219 --> 08:00.685
But I hear people at 40 saying, my gosh, if I don't do this, I don't have that much longer.

08:00.665 --> 08:03.048
Well, so that's an individual matter, too.

08:03.088 --> 08:06.611
But I do agree that it's multiple transitions.

08:06.752 --> 08:07.993
It's time perspective.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.835
It's your perception of options.

08:09.935 --> 08:14.580
So there are lots of things out there that make the difference in terms of counseling.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.080
Jim?

08:15.561 --> 08:26.773
Well, you know, something that I have seen repeatedly in my work is that a person will come in with a problem, and then because of the problem, they've

08:26.990 --> 08:32.775
you know, that they have the symptoms of anxiety and depression, or sometimes they drink too much and so forth.

08:33.336 --> 08:41.163
But as I get to know that person, I find that much of the time that they had a difficult childhood.

08:43.565 --> 08:49.271
Let's say, I don't want to say difficult, not necessarily always physical abuse, although sometimes this happens.

08:49.911 --> 08:52.874
And then this kind of gets them off to a bad start.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.917
Okay, then they, lots of times they've made some,

08:56.470 --> 09:01.878
poor choices throughout their lives, but they still kind of keep things together.

09:01.938 --> 09:10.029
And then lo and behold, then they get 65 or whatever age and all these things happen and they just kind of wilt.

09:10.871 --> 09:13.655
I've just seen this scenario happen repeatedly.

09:14.776 --> 09:15.357
Interesting.

09:16.113 --> 09:26.487
On a related but somewhat different topic, do you find that people respond differently to the idea of therapy in terms of age, Jim?

09:27.589 --> 09:35.540
Well, to a great degree, I do all of my work on a very informal basis.

09:35.880 --> 09:42.930
And to some degree, to the people that I see, see, I visit them in their homes 90% of the time.

09:43.231 --> 09:44.854
That's unusual and wonderful.

09:45.014 --> 09:45.815
It is.

09:45.935 --> 09:48.259
It's just absolutely fantastic.

09:48.439 --> 09:52.826
But to some degree, they don't realize that we're doing therapy.

09:52.926 --> 09:58.695
I'm just coming out and talking and I'm listening and encouraging the talk.

09:58.916 --> 10:01.820
And I get to be a friend.

10:01.840 --> 10:08.631
Well, you know, one of the things that I found that does differentiate people, but I'm not sure it's necessarily age, but...

10:09.556 --> 10:20.772
In talking with an older woman recently whose husband had Parkinson's, and she had cancer, and they were in their late 70s, and she was very, very depressed.

10:20.792 --> 10:26.120
And I didn't live in the same city where she lived, but I said, I know that I could get somebody.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.283
I would find somebody who could come to her house.

10:28.343 --> 10:29.284
I just knew I could.

10:29.304 --> 10:36.154
And she wouldn't talk to anybody who had a label counselor, social worker, whatever.

10:36.134 --> 11:00.235
even though I said well it would be more like a friend or companion and I thought you know if there were any message I would like to give people of all ages is that there are opportunities for help and that sometimes people are afraid that they think it shows a weakness to go for help and yet it really shows a strength because by going to somebody you can really get an opportunity to

11:00.215 --> 11:05.700
Step back, look at your resources, and really move on and move ahead.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.423
And you're entitled to relief from your problems.

11:09.503 --> 11:14.168
But something that's troubled me, Jim, is how to change people's orientation.

11:15.309 --> 11:21.815
That's the voice of Nancy Schlossberg, professor at the University of Maryland, author of Overwhelmed and Counseling Adults in Transition.

11:22.295 --> 11:30.002
Our other guest by phone is James Warnick, chief counselor at the Decatur, Illinois Mental Health Center and author of Listening with Different Ears, Counseling People Over 60.

11:30.573 --> 11:38.063
That question of how willing and eager are older Americans to accept therapy in the first place is an interesting one.

11:38.083 --> 11:43.350
In your experience, Jim, are they more or less reluctant than their younger brethren and sister?

11:44.131 --> 11:59.010
Well, to some degree, see, whenever I receive a call from someone or from a family member, and I would say a third of my referrals come from the individual, a third from a family member,

11:59.294 --> 12:03.540
and a third from related service organizations.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.782
But anyway, these folks are in crisis.

12:06.123 --> 12:15.956
I mean, they have reached the point to where their life is not good as they know it, and they need help.

12:15.976 --> 12:23.125
And so the more sophisticated people will call me themselves.

12:23.662 --> 12:35.293
But usually the people that aren't as sophisticated about services and so forth, it'll be family members or other agencies.

12:35.353 --> 12:39.076
But something that, again, I have found this repeatedly.

12:39.517 --> 12:48.645
Okay, I mentioned the people who had the difficult childhood and so forth, and then they encounter these challenges.

12:48.665 --> 12:50.867
Well, these challenges, well, these folks,

12:51.522 --> 12:58.551
need a relatively long-term help, I mean, because they're more fragile.

12:58.991 --> 13:12.748
But there's also another kind of person who is stable and have lived good and lived successfully all of their lives, and then suddenly they are overwhelmed with something.

13:13.730 --> 13:14.931
Let me give you an example.

13:15.532 --> 13:18.095
I had a woman call me.

13:18.195 --> 13:18.856
She was 68.

13:19.397 --> 13:20.398
She was an attorney.

13:20.632 --> 13:31.544
Two years before this, her husband had had a stroke, and this had left him incapacitated, and it affected his personality.

13:31.564 --> 13:33.346
It was really difficult to deal with.

13:34.006 --> 13:38.031
And anyway, she was just really in bad shape.

13:38.471 --> 13:40.734
But basically, she was a strong person.

13:41.314 --> 13:48.462
So I saw her only a couple of times because she just needed to be told that...

13:48.678 --> 13:54.787
She had the capacity to deal with this situation, and she was dealing with this situation.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.872
And we made some other mechanical suggestions about getting help.

13:59.313 --> 14:06.383
But basically, you've got the stable person who you can make lots of progress with in one or two sessions.

14:06.886 --> 14:17.188
That leads me to a question of, this might sound inside psychology, but I know people of all ages are interested in how their parents are dealt with or how they are dealt with.

14:17.769 --> 14:26.768
If a counselor or a therapist is generally non-directive, or I think in psychological terms, if I remember right, it's Rogerian, with younger clients,

14:26.748 --> 14:30.953
How does that generally work with older people, that non-directedness?

14:31.354 --> 14:40.906
Because it seems to me, Jim, like you're suggesting, in many cases, a very directed, very purposeful counseling may be more effective with older clients.

14:41.307 --> 14:43.850
Well, it depends on the individual.

14:43.890 --> 14:48.496
There are some people who kind of want to be told.

14:48.916 --> 14:54.223
But on the whole, what you do is take the approach that you've talked about

14:54.558 --> 15:06.745
Because, see, any person has to, let's say, come to realize what their situation is and what they can do to help.

15:06.944 --> 15:13.636
And so you just kind of prod them and push them in different directions.

15:13.656 --> 15:15.359
Nancy, what's your general approach to that question?

15:15.379 --> 15:23.914
Well, I want to sort of back up and say, in a sense, all the things Jim says sort of fit into this transition model I've developed over the years.

15:23.954 --> 15:27.180
Jim, I'd like to kind of share it with you and get your reaction.

15:28.392 --> 15:34.410
It's a structure for looking at anybody, whether the person's 50, 60, 70, 80.

15:34.510 --> 15:41.912
The person comes with this problem or you reach out to a person and there's an issue that's upsetting.

15:42.938 --> 15:56.733
What we've developed over the years is what I now popularly call the 4S system, where anybody who comes to you to really understand what's going on with them and how to help them, you help them.

15:56.753 --> 15:58.996
They can do it themselves or you can do it with them.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.138
You can assess their 4Ss.

16:01.639 --> 16:04.422
You look at the situation at the time you're with them.

16:04.902 --> 16:07.305
Are there multiple transitions going on?

16:07.705 --> 16:10.228
Is this situation in their control?

16:10.208 --> 16:12.173
Is this of long-term duration?

16:12.213 --> 16:15.180
So there are a lot of properties that define the situation.

16:16.002 --> 16:21.456
Then we can look at the supports the person has at home, in the community, at work, with friends.

16:22.158 --> 16:23.461
What are the supports?

16:23.982 --> 16:26.007
We then can look at the self.

16:25.987 --> 16:28.852
How able is the person to deal with ambiguity?

16:28.972 --> 16:30.996
Is the person an optimist or a pessimist?

16:31.677 --> 16:32.779
What about the person?

16:33.360 --> 16:36.124
And then we can look at the strategies a person uses.

16:36.184 --> 16:44.198
Does somebody use lots of strategies flexibly or just rely on crying or yelling or whatever it is?

16:44.380 --> 17:00.495
Now, once we get the four S's, we can say we could have a number of people who are 65 and have just lost their spouse and retired, but they're not the same because each person's situation is different, the supports are different, the self is different, and the strategies.

17:01.035 --> 17:06.540
By assessing the four S's, we can then see, well, I need to work on my support system.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.302
And the other person says, well, it's myself.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.743
I'm such a pessimist.

17:09.763 --> 17:14.387
And somebody else says, I need to increase my coping repertoire.

17:14.367 --> 17:33.692
So over the years, what I've done is rather than focus on the age and whether one age has more losses than another, is to focus on a structure for looking at anybody of any age, that is during the adult years, and give them or the counselor a way to step back and look at

17:33.672 --> 17:39.118
the resources and deficits a person brings and then develop an intervention based on it.

17:39.499 --> 17:45.946
So whether I would be Rogerian or not would vary, yes, at the beginning, and I love Jim's title, Listening.

17:46.807 --> 17:48.729
As you're listening, you're Rogerian.

17:49.390 --> 17:52.033
As you're assessing, you might be more collaborative.

17:52.254 --> 17:56.859
As you're developing an action plan with the person, again, it's going to depend on the person.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.562
But so much depends on

17:59.542 --> 18:23.811
which direction you're going in and i think a good eclectic counselor and i think jim sounds like one is probably your best bet question if we can expect such situations such such losses as the loss of a spouse the loss of mobility the loss of of residents or at least the downsizing of residents eventually if we can anticipate them why do we still see

18:23.791 --> 18:29.018
so much grief that sometimes, as you call it, Jim, it becomes abnormal grief.

18:29.518 --> 18:32.082
These are anticipated changes for older folks.

18:32.883 --> 18:39.792
What is the coping mechanism that so many of us are lacking that allows us not to combat these feelings?

18:40.913 --> 18:44.858
Okay, I think the difference is that we are all individuals.

18:45.720 --> 18:52.228
A person that is 70 years old, for example, has lived 25,000 days, okay?

18:52.478 --> 18:56.524
Some of the days have been good days and some have been bad days.

18:56.724 --> 19:03.473
So we come to this age of 70 with different capacities to deal with situations.

19:03.974 --> 19:14.328
I mean, there are, I would say, 85% of the population can deal with these situations themselves.

19:14.348 --> 19:15.870
But you've got this

19:16.188 --> 19:21.717
smaller numbers that really need help because they don't have the capacity.

19:21.797 --> 19:34.517
And, of course, where the capacity comes from, I feel, is from how stable was their childhood and what's happened to them over the next 50 years.

19:34.957 --> 19:39.985
I'd like to take a crack at that, too, if I may.

19:40.285 --> 19:49.336
I think you make a wonderful point about anticipated transitions and one that is made in the field of adult development.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.443
If you can anticipate

19:51.541 --> 20:02.652
and do rehearsing for retirement or widowhood, you are going to be somewhat better prepared than if it's a sudden and unrehearsed and unexpected transition.

20:02.692 --> 20:04.634
There's no question about that.

20:05.035 --> 20:12.062
But the real issue is the degree to which what has happened to you or what you brought about has changed your life.

20:12.562 --> 20:14.824
And I have four things that you can really look at.

20:15.185 --> 20:19.489
How much has this changed the roles in your life, your routines,

20:19.469 --> 20:22.599
your assumptions, your relationships.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.027
Some transitions change all four.

20:25.890 --> 20:30.424
You have just retired to southern Florida,

20:31.231 --> 20:33.093
And then... At the 18th hole.

20:33.293 --> 20:35.715
At the 18th hole, your spouse dies.

20:36.656 --> 20:38.978
This is a new community and you know nobody.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.480
Everything's changed.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.142
Roles, relationships, routines, assumptions.

20:43.583 --> 20:51.350
The other person who's staying in their home community, for example, loses a spouse, doesn't lose necessarily everything else then.

20:51.771 --> 20:58.437
So you have to assess the degree to which your roles, relationships, routines and assumptions are being changed.

20:58.417 --> 21:05.267
And the more that is, I mean, you can be 30 and have everything shattered, and you will really be undone for a while.

21:05.567 --> 21:09.714
So once again, I don't think it's age, but I think it's the degree to which it changes your life.

21:10.154 --> 21:16.864
But I really insist that we talk about aging, and I'm not...

21:16.844 --> 21:23.430
an optimist, and I don't think that, I mean, I am an optimist, but I don't think age is the best thing since sliced bread.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.873
But I think there are a lot of positives that happen, too.

21:27.434 --> 21:31.597
And I think we don't want to just sort of talk about aging as if it's all losses.

21:31.657 --> 21:36.382
There are a lot of gains, a lot of freedoms, a lot of good things that happen.

21:36.942 --> 21:43.028
But the grief is going to depend on how it's affected your whole life.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.670
And I think there are a lot of younger people

21:46.274 --> 21:49.119
who are very affected and can't get it together.

21:49.259 --> 21:59.436
I know of a 28-year-old who went into a deep depression about a breakup that lasted much longer than somebody I know who was 70 and just lost his wife.

21:59.976 --> 22:02.781
I'm just not sure, again, that its age.

22:03.487 --> 22:14.710
One of the important transitions, particularly in the popular culture or mythology, though there seems to be some evidence for it, the more important transition is the so-called midlife crisis.

22:15.331 --> 22:21.985
And it occurs to me that how men in particular handle that crisis and how women react to it.

22:21.965 --> 22:26.431
is often a vital stepping stone to how we will transition the rest of our lives.

22:27.252 --> 22:30.316
Jim, in your experience, what is this midlife crisis?

22:30.416 --> 22:31.117
Does it exist?

22:31.577 --> 22:36.303
And how does it affect the way we transition into, as you point out, the last third of life?

22:37.004 --> 22:47.297
Well, to some degree, I think this midlife period is very important and

22:47.547 --> 22:49.630
and affects some people greatly.

22:50.351 --> 22:53.816
Other people, it doesn't affect them that much, you know.

22:53.836 --> 22:58.203
And to some degree, see, men and women handle this differently.

22:58.283 --> 23:06.575
To a degree, men, when they reach their 50s, they kind of mellow a little bit, you know.

23:07.697 --> 23:15.428
Women, when they reach in their 50s, and again, this is a broad generalization, some women become very more,

23:15.644 --> 23:30.262
much more serious about life and serious in the respect that if they have worked in a home, for example, and then they've started into the workplace, they've become very serious about their job.

23:31.023 --> 23:39.013
And so anyway, to some degree, men and women are coming from different perspectives on this.

23:39.093 --> 23:43.238
Now, this is changing as women, for example, have

23:43.690 --> 23:48.456
spent, oh, much of their life in careers.

23:48.476 --> 24:01.052
But some of the people we're seeing today, at least that I see, they come from kind of the old school, so to speak.

24:01.072 --> 24:05.077
Well, you might expect how I would approach it.

24:05.097 --> 24:08.061
I think the midlife crisis is an artifact of the media.

24:08.902 --> 24:13.790
I don't think, and there is evidence, there's a lot of research to show there is no midlife crisis.

24:13.991 --> 24:16.043
There are crises all through life.

24:16.276 --> 24:29.735
And there is no one time, I mean, Costa McRae have done a major study of issues that affect men over their life course, and they found no grouping of men at midlife.

24:29.775 --> 24:31.337
There are crises at midlife.

24:31.357 --> 24:34.582
There's no question about it, but there are crises all through life.

24:35.062 --> 24:44.055
And this mythical midlife crisis, we read about it in the paper, the guy who needs to find himself, the sort of Gauguin or the woman –

24:44.035 --> 24:45.377
Go get him.

24:45.957 --> 24:48.340
He cuts his hair, gets a different car and a different wife.

24:48.561 --> 24:53.146
But it's not to say they're not midlife transitions where you begin to see time differently.

24:53.527 --> 25:01.357
But the crisis element where you better leave your wife and go off with a younger person who really understands you or an older person who really understands you.

25:01.817 --> 25:03.840
I mean, yes, that happens, but it's not.

25:05.722 --> 25:09.587
You can't expect that when you get to midlife, you're going to have your crisis and get it over with.

25:09.567 --> 25:22.108
Now, with Jim, there is some research, I'm not sure, Gutman's work, but there is a lot of research to show that what Jim said is absolutely true, that men and women at midlife,

25:22.325 --> 25:29.334
the traditional male who's been oriented toward work suddenly becomes more nurturing.

25:29.354 --> 25:30.415
You know, what's this all about?

25:30.455 --> 25:31.476
What have I been doing this?

25:31.857 --> 25:38.966
And the traditional woman who's been taking care of the children and making lunches and dinners says, what's all this anyway?

25:38.986 --> 25:43.992
I want to get out there and sort of fly in the world of work.

25:44.032 --> 25:45.834
And I agree with Jim that that's changing.

25:46.335 --> 25:52.062
But I do think that this midlife crisis, as if it is something that's bound to happen,

25:52.463 --> 25:54.003
It's bound to happen to you.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.667
But it doesn't have to be at midlife.

25:55.967 --> 25:59.011
I recently had what I called a belated midlife crisis.

25:59.131 --> 26:01.254
I wrote to my hairdresser.

26:01.294 --> 26:02.596
I wanted to change hairdressers.

26:02.616 --> 26:04.699
And I said, this is a belated midlife crisis.

26:05.099 --> 26:07.462
It was either leaving a husband or changing hairdressers.

26:07.502 --> 26:09.986
And I decided to change hairdressers.

26:10.086 --> 26:15.453
But you see, I only used the midlife crisis as a vehicle.

26:15.513 --> 26:18.457
And I was ashamed of myself because I know there's no midlife crisis.

26:18.497 --> 26:23.483
Yet it's so much part of the popular literature that I even used it as my excuse to leave my hairdressers.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.076
I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.858
This is Prime Time Radio.

26:27.899 --> 26:35.866
On the other hand, I had a fascinating conversation with a woman recently who has been in the computer business, the software business, and she is reaching midlife.

26:35.926 --> 26:41.231
I'd say she's getting close to 50, and she's having the same reaction that you were talking about the men having.

26:41.671 --> 26:44.574
She's been an executive in a computer firm.

26:45.014 --> 26:47.116
She's reaching 50, and she said, what is this all about?

26:47.196 --> 26:48.718
All I'm doing is pursuing dollars.

26:49.218 --> 26:50.799
And I said, well, what do you want to do?

26:50.819 --> 26:53.622
She says, I want to sell my sister's cloth.

26:53.602 --> 26:55.344
My sister makes pattern cloth.

26:55.424 --> 26:56.826
I don't want to sell computers anymore.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.569
I don't want to do the software thing.

26:58.589 --> 26:59.370
But what am I going to do?

26:59.390 --> 27:01.372
She says, my income will be a third of what it was.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.655
And I said, well, what's important to you?

27:04.076 --> 27:07.480
And she said, that's why I just went to Martha's Vineyard to ask that very question.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.482
And she hadn't made up her mind.

27:08.742 --> 27:16.993
I'm wondering, as more women get into executive positions, if they aren't going to feel the same kinds of pressures as men do, questioning their values.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.506
Well, and I think this is, first of all, you should be a counselor.

27:19.526 --> 27:20.488
You're in the wrong field.

27:21.470 --> 27:26.360
Now that we've established that, Jim and I will help you after the show, and you can move into counseling.

27:26.962 --> 27:31.491
But I think what really we're seeing is that people stock take at different times.

27:31.631 --> 27:32.974
And they ask the question,

27:32.954 --> 27:35.237
Is what I'm doing, does that make any sense?

27:35.257 --> 27:36.519
Does it have meaning for me?

27:37.020 --> 27:42.368
And that's a lot of what's attributed to the midlife crisis, but it does happen many times.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.070
It happens at retirement.

27:44.110 --> 27:46.654
It happens all through life when you say, why am I doing?

27:46.694 --> 27:48.597
My son just finished social work training.

27:48.617 --> 27:49.939
He said, why did I do this?

27:50.119 --> 27:51.321
Are there any jobs out there?

27:51.641 --> 27:54.706
He's having a major assessment and stock taking.

27:55.106 --> 28:02.337
So I think that is certainly something we can all expect in our lives if we're thoughtful people is we're going to step back and say,

28:02.317 --> 28:04.019
Is this what my life is about?

28:04.139 --> 28:04.600
Jim Warnick?

28:06.062 --> 28:08.125
Oh, I agree completely.

28:08.906 --> 28:24.146
I have a couple of friends who they have been working full tilt for 30 years and working in the corporations and attaining this and working at keeping this position.

28:24.727 --> 28:30.214
But, hey, here they are now in their 50s and, you know,

28:30.464 --> 28:34.171
They are really wondering what to do.

28:35.072 --> 28:44.850
I mean, they know, number one, that their job could end tomorrow, even though they are very, very successful, because this is the way the corporate world is.

28:44.970 --> 28:50.380
So they're kind of preparing for another lifestyle, so to speak.

28:50.714 --> 29:00.467
As we all recognize this, as it impacts more and more and more families, how in your anticipation as professional counselors is this going to change the counseling task that lies ahead?

29:00.888 --> 29:09.360
As people approach retirement with no feeling that they're ever going to retire, for example, more and more people, even in their 40s, say, oh, I don't even plan to retire.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.722
I'm going to die in harness.

29:10.822 --> 29:11.202
I know it.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.245
How does that change your job as counselors?

29:13.934 --> 29:15.419
Why would that change your job?

29:15.940 --> 29:22.541
In other words, if somebody... I mean, you're not there to help people because they're retiring.

29:22.561 --> 29:26.914
You're there to help people at different points in their lives when they're dealing with situations...

29:27.350 --> 29:28.972
that they need some help with.

29:29.413 --> 29:33.159
And whether they retire or they don't retire is really not relevant.

29:33.279 --> 29:43.554
I think we're going to need lots of counselors to help people as they get older, just because there are a lot of people, and there are a lot more people in their 80s and 70s.

29:43.875 --> 29:46.118
But I don't think the retirement is the issue.

29:46.604 --> 29:48.406
We have run out of time, unfortunately.

29:48.446 --> 29:52.892
We'd like to tell you that both of our guests have outstanding books available for reading.

29:53.412 --> 29:56.576
If you'd like a specific number, you can call us here at Primetime Radio.

29:57.037 --> 30:12.055
But Overwhelmed by Lexington Books is written by our guest Nancy Schlossberg, along with Counseling Adults in Transition, published by Springer Publishing Company, and the publisher of Listening with Different Ears, Counseling People Over 60 by James Warnick is QED Press.

30:12.035 --> 30:16.921
We thank you, Jim Warnick from Decatur, Illinois, for being with us, and Nancy Schlossberg from the University of Maryland.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.844
Thanks for being our guests on Primetime Radio.

30:19.044 --> 30:19.465
Thank you.

30:19.785 --> 30:20.186
Thank you.

30:20.646 --> 30:21.707
Bibliomania.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.191
Our next guest calls it a gentle madness.

30:24.651 --> 30:35.325
Stay tuned.

30:39.136 --> 30:50.412
Thank you.

31:00.550 --> 31:03.356
What do Cleopatra and John La Roquette have in common?

31:03.497 --> 31:04.980
Well, they're both bibliomanes.

31:05.040 --> 31:05.982
They love books.

31:06.183 --> 31:08.889
We find out about their gentle madness in just a moment.

31:09.149 --> 31:14.020
Stay tuned.

31:31.212 --> 31:32.874
Welcome back to Prime Time Radio.

31:32.954 --> 31:34.275
I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington.

31:34.936 --> 31:55.339
You know, in these days of constant drum-beating, incessant conversation about being online and all the alleged features of the electronic age, it's almost possible to forget that there's a significant portion of the population for whom the aroma of a new book or the sensuous feel of a Morocco leather binding on an old one is one of life's greatest pleasures.

31:55.359 --> 32:00.645
To pick up a fine book and to reluctantly turn its pages because you just don't want to reach the end,

32:00.625 --> 32:05.333
is still to me at least one of the easiest and most accessible of pleasures.

32:05.513 --> 32:07.136
Call me old-fashioned.

32:08.438 --> 32:12.084
To many who love books, however, the reading of them becomes secondary.

32:12.625 --> 32:17.774
They look for points, factors, or qualities about individual volumes that mark them as valuable.

32:18.014 --> 32:25.266
They look for titles they don't have in series they may have created for themselves in dust jackets that always have to be pristine.

32:25.246 --> 32:29.897
In some cases, the majority of books in modern first collections have never even been opened.

32:29.957 --> 32:32.443
They are, in the true sense, in mint condition.

32:33.004 --> 32:37.375
How far back does this desire for the physical presence of books and the fanatical pursuit of them go?

32:37.735 --> 32:41.945
Well, let's go back at least as far as an alleged ancestor of mine, St.

32:41.965 --> 32:42.386
Cuthbert.

32:42.747 --> 32:43.930
Now, it seems that...

32:43.910 --> 32:44.691
Well, wait a minute.

32:44.891 --> 32:46.694
Let's let our guest tell the story of St.

32:46.734 --> 32:47.975
Cuthbert and the Gospel of St.

32:48.035 --> 32:55.264
John, as well as many other stories from his book, A Gentle Madness, Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

32:55.605 --> 32:57.287
Nicholas Basbanes, welcome to Washington.

32:57.307 --> 32:58.368
Thank you very much, Mike.

32:58.388 --> 33:00.351
Let's go back to my ancestor.

33:00.851 --> 33:09.242
He would be, according to my lights at least, probably a bibliophile, if not a bibliomain, if he's going to be buried with his head on one of his favorite books.

33:09.222 --> 33:13.127
And, of course, he became a saint, Saint Cuthbert.

33:13.447 --> 33:15.910
Which probably takes him out of the realm of my ancestors.

33:15.930 --> 33:25.923
Which may account for the perfect condition of the book when they opened his casket some, is it four or five hundred years later, when they were forced to flee this island off the coast of England.

33:26.924 --> 33:34.673
And there was this remarkable book, this gospel, in its original binding, of course, of calfskin on lime boards.

33:35.434 --> 33:35.955
And it is...

33:36.391 --> 33:42.400
I understand the oldest book of its kind in the world, and it's in the British Library on display right now.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.385
And still in pristine condition, I understand.

33:45.665 --> 33:47.067
Pristine, pristine.

33:47.087 --> 33:48.009
May I just say something?

33:48.029 --> 33:49.451
You're not old-fashioned, by the way.

33:49.491 --> 33:53.657
I would call you gently mad if you have the...

33:53.637 --> 33:57.361
You described the symptoms perfectly in your opening statement.

33:57.421 --> 34:08.975
Well, I think I share that madness, that gentle madness, with thousands of our listeners because, as I say, in this day and age when everything relevant seems to be online, a good book just still feels real good.

34:09.516 --> 34:14.782
And that is one of the marks of this, I really hesitate to call it a disease, but it's an affliction.

34:16.023 --> 34:19.948
If you feel the vibrations passing from the pages and the bindings,

34:20.705 --> 34:26.713
through your fingers and up your arm and into your being, you have it.

34:26.733 --> 34:27.494
You have that.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.176
But you know, I was going through some things.

34:29.237 --> 34:31.099
Now, I've never heard of a pewter mane.

34:31.560 --> 34:35.385
I've never heard of a numismatist mane or any of these.

34:35.505 --> 34:38.209
There's no mania for any of these other collection habits.

34:38.229 --> 34:39.771
How come there's bibliomania?

34:41.333 --> 34:43.095
How long have people been collecting stamps?

34:43.135 --> 34:44.337
How long have there been stamps?

34:44.918 --> 34:45.799
A hundred odd years.

34:46.420 --> 34:49.564
People have been mad about books for as long as there have been books.

34:50.168 --> 35:01.148
I suspect, now there's no documentation, but I would imagine in ancient Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago when the first books appeared on clay tablets, there were people who venerated them.

35:01.288 --> 35:04.273
I mean, language is the miracle of our species.

35:05.035 --> 35:12.328
And, of course, to preserve our thoughts on clay tablets or on papyrus scrolls or in vellum, on parchment, on paper,

35:13.068 --> 35:19.456
There really is something magical, and people have just become quite passionate in their zeal to own these things.

35:19.476 --> 35:31.631
Well, you know, when you think about it, there is something magical about a book you can pick up on Monday, and after everything that happens to you between Monday and Thursday, you read it again on Friday, and the whole meaning of the page has changed, and it's still in the same book.

35:32.392 --> 35:38.940
Where else can you get an experience differently each time that you go to it when you think it's going to be the same, and the words are the same and everything?

35:38.920 --> 35:47.513
And not only that, but it will last, if you take care of it, it will last your lifetime, and you can pass it on.

35:48.590 --> 35:54.155
I'm really surprised that some people will say, well, a book costs $25 or $30 or $35.

35:55.216 --> 35:55.637
Think about it.

35:55.657 --> 36:01.342
You go to a movie, whatever a movie costs, that experience is over in two hours, a book you have forever.

36:02.444 --> 36:12.033
Speaking of that, though, speaking of reading them and using them, how many of the books of the bibliomains and the bibliophiles, the collectors you talked about, how many of the books simply were not read?

36:12.073 --> 36:16.217
They were simply collected as items not to read but to have on the shelf.

36:16.197 --> 36:22.429
Well, it is said, one of the questions is, how do you know, how does a person know that he or she is a book collector?

36:22.570 --> 36:28.682
And one of the cynical answers is, you know you're a collector the day you buy a book, you know you will never read.

36:30.245 --> 36:32.790
It kind of makes sense to a degree.

36:34.473 --> 36:36.838
I have a couple of first editions of Faulkner.

36:37.409 --> 36:39.151
But these are in such wonderful condition.

36:39.211 --> 36:39.952
I don't touch these.

36:40.232 --> 36:40.813
Are you kidding?

36:40.913 --> 36:41.974
I don't touch these books.

36:42.054 --> 36:42.594
I hide them.

36:43.275 --> 36:46.899
I read Faulkner in the Library of America editions.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.542
The same would go for many other authors.

36:49.562 --> 36:55.168
So, yes, you're collecting an artifact, but it's the content, I guess, that means a lot to you.

36:55.348 --> 37:02.355
This may explain why you quoted Dr. Rosenbach of Philadelphia, saying not one great library was accumulated by a great scholar.

37:02.756 --> 37:06.960
Is it because scholars have to read the books, and therefore they don't buy books to collect them?

37:06.940 --> 37:08.382
Scholars are scholars.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.004
Scholars are doing research.

37:10.184 --> 37:13.569
Their intention is to write a history or to do criticism.

37:14.150 --> 37:18.356
The collector isn't necessarily preserving things for the sake of scholarship.

37:18.396 --> 37:21.720
That happens to be one of the very happy consequences of it.

37:21.740 --> 37:31.834
But as John Hill Burton said 130 or so years ago in The Book Hunter, it is the disposition of the class to find value where there seems to be none.

37:31.934 --> 37:34.618
He says they will find value in a heap of rubbish.

37:35.740 --> 37:36.120
They will...

37:36.421 --> 37:38.885
collect things that everybody else thinks is garbage.

37:39.666 --> 37:44.874
100 years later, 200 years later, perhaps other people will find value there.

37:44.894 --> 37:47.358
I mean, Melville wasn't collected at all in his lifetime.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.263
A totally neglected writer until the 1920s.

37:50.463 --> 37:58.256
It's funny, my wife is from Australia and she has always amused me with the term they use for flea markets.

37:58.376 --> 37:59.378
It's trash and treasure.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.282
And that exemplifies exactly what you said.

38:02.302 --> 38:03.544
You never know which it's going to be.

38:03.745 --> 38:04.065
Well,

38:04.535 --> 38:15.996
One of the epigraphs of my book, the fourth one, I quote Zach Jenks, a character in Larry McMurtry's novel Cadillac Jack who says, anything can be anywhere.

38:16.313 --> 38:17.695
And I live by that.

38:17.936 --> 38:19.097
I go to flea markets.

38:19.298 --> 38:19.899
I stop.

38:20.159 --> 38:22.563
My car will stop if I see yard sales.

38:22.683 --> 38:27.010
I look in baskets of junk, and you never know what you're going to find.

38:27.530 --> 38:35.082
I mean, you have the case of the Tamerlane, which a commercial fisherman found in an antiques barn in New Hampshire for $15, right?

38:35.416 --> 38:39.501
It was sold at auction for $198,000 a year and a half later.

38:40.242 --> 38:42.044
You never know, which is part of the fun.

38:42.284 --> 38:43.726
My guest is Nicholas Basbanes.

38:43.766 --> 38:47.951
His book is A Gentle Madness, Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

38:48.591 --> 38:53.677
And in your book, you don't create this list, but I started it, and you can probably finish it.

38:53.757 --> 38:56.861
I created the Basbanes Hall of Fame of Bibliomains.

38:57.341 --> 38:59.584
I started with Richard Heber.

38:59.564 --> 39:03.450
Who had eight houses filled with books.

39:03.470 --> 39:06.875
He has to be included in the Hall of Fame of Bibliomanes, right?

39:06.915 --> 39:10.321
Well, he would probably be chairman of the board, I would think.

39:10.721 --> 39:20.256
When Dibdin basically coined, he really didn't coin the phrase Bibliomania, but he gave it prominence with a book titled Bibliomania.

39:20.675 --> 39:28.063
in 1809, and he dedicated it to Richard Heber, who, as you have just described, filled these eight houses with 200,000 books.

39:28.443 --> 39:33.669
He said, every person should have at least three books, one for the shelf, one to read, and one to loan.

39:34.169 --> 39:37.313
Because if you're like me, you don't like to let people borrow your books.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.054
Isn't that strange?

39:38.094 --> 39:44.120
I've got a separate file on my computer for on loan, too, and I keep very careful track of it.

39:44.541 --> 39:46.823
Another one I put on my list is Petrarch.

39:47.544 --> 39:49.005
One wouldn't think of him as a bibliomane.

39:49.226 --> 39:50.547
Oh, why not?

39:50.527 --> 39:53.092
He's famous for other things.

39:53.112 --> 39:58.401
For many other things, but he basically started the humanistic movement.

39:58.462 --> 40:11.826
He actually went out and was the first Renaissance book hunter, and he rescued all these extraordinary manuscripts which had been lying under dirt and dust in the monasteries through what we call the Dark Ages.

40:12.245 --> 40:17.891
But so much is owed to Petrarch, a magnificent book hunter.

40:18.432 --> 40:23.978
Another man who is maybe not a bibliomaine, but I put him there because of what he did, Lessing J. Rosenwald.

40:24.618 --> 40:34.449
Oh, you know, I have a quote very early on in the book which asserts that the bibliophile is the master of his books.

40:34.529 --> 40:36.832
The bibliomaine is their slave.

40:37.072 --> 40:41.897
Now, I would suspect, using that as your definition, that Rosenwald...

40:42.552 --> 40:51.007
was the master of his books, but he was dedicated to them, and he is considered the greatest benefactor in the history of the Library of Congress.

40:51.568 --> 40:58.440
All these wonderful illustrated books, which are just a few blocks from where we sit here, were the gift to the nation of Lessing Rosenwald.

40:58.460 --> 41:03.008
And yet perhaps one of the most interesting stories about Rosenwald is the book he bought that he hated.

41:03.612 --> 41:05.616
That's the mark of a great collector, isn't it?

41:05.797 --> 41:09.905
Because one of the themes that runs throughout my book is how the collector preserves.

41:10.747 --> 41:16.980
And this was a book which was a manuscript actually that

41:17.500 --> 41:23.291
kind of an anti-Semitic thing that he was fearful would fall into the hands of the Nazis.

41:24.073 --> 41:34.834
And so he went, he bid for it at auction, he won, and then he put it under seal for 50 years to protect it, not to destroy it, not to hide it, but so at some point...

41:34.814 --> 41:39.160
It could be dealt with properly by scholars, and that's what happened.

41:39.180 --> 41:45.608
And it turns out that he bought that at an auction where he was being bid against furiously by a woman who later, in fact, turned out to be a German agent.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.869
That's exactly correct.

41:47.150 --> 41:48.912
I put Toby Holtzman on my list.

41:49.613 --> 41:51.215
What's the story of Toby Holtzman?

41:51.435 --> 41:57.663
I spent two days with Toby out in Detroit, and the man is really dedicated.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.205
He lives in a beautiful home.

41:59.485 --> 42:00.066
He's wealthy.

42:00.927 --> 42:04.652
And I noticed going through his house, I said, there are no pictures on the walls.

42:05.341 --> 42:07.625
And I said this, and he said, ah, very good.

42:07.885 --> 42:11.050
He said, there is no room in this house for anything but books.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.993
He said, this is a house of books.

42:14.035 --> 42:17.200
And he was quite an unusual, he is quite an unusual collector.

42:17.220 --> 42:22.589
He collects what we call modern first, which is what most, I suspect, American collectors collect.

42:23.330 --> 42:24.011
He would divide them.

42:24.572 --> 42:30.923
One side of the room is living collectors, pardon me, living authors, and on the other side are those who were deceased.

42:30.943 --> 42:31.804
And the day...

42:32.071 --> 42:33.192
That somebody dies.

42:33.373 --> 42:34.194
If they got shifted, huh?

42:34.214 --> 42:36.356
He moves the book to the other side of the room.

42:36.456 --> 42:37.277
And I said, why is that?

42:37.297 --> 42:39.580
He said, because I am committed to the living and to the future.

42:40.181 --> 42:44.707
And so he has an eye out for books that will be collectible.

42:44.907 --> 42:49.152
Not only that, but I understand he's an almost inveterate autograph, an inscription collector.

42:49.593 --> 42:55.480
He is said to be the model for Updike's Marvin Fetterbush and Becca's Back.

42:55.460 --> 43:01.098
the guy who will show up in your face at airports and ask you to sign books.

43:01.199 --> 43:06.516
He'll send books to you if you're an author in the mail, ask you to inscribe them, specify quite

43:06.850 --> 43:08.592
where he wants them signed.

43:08.672 --> 43:22.464
And I've talked to a number of authors who shall remain nameless, one close by who has said, oh, my God, it's Toby walking up the street and pulling down the shades.

43:22.784 --> 43:24.946
He just walks up with a book and says, sign it here.

43:25.147 --> 43:26.127
That's correct.

43:26.208 --> 43:27.168
But it's quite a collection.

43:27.689 --> 43:34.495
The last one for now, because there are many more, has to be Steven Blumberg, about whom you spend a major portion of your book

43:34.475 --> 43:37.561
Not exactly your usual bibliomane, though.

43:38.062 --> 43:45.195
Stephen was arrested about six months after I not only started this book but had the title, A Gentle Madness.

43:45.997 --> 43:53.952
And this is the individual, for those of your listeners who don't remember, was arrested for stealing something like 24,000 books

43:54.286 --> 44:06.135
valued at about seven million dollars from three hundred and forty five libraries in forty five states two canadian provinces and the district of columbia and what made him interesting to me

44:06.402 --> 44:11.590
is not that he was just a thief, because he is a thief, but that he stole these books because he loved them.

44:11.931 --> 44:13.453
Not for greed, but to collect them.

44:13.733 --> 44:15.035
And he's now in prison still.

44:16.017 --> 44:17.359
I've been corresponding with him.

44:17.419 --> 44:18.340
I went to his trial.

44:18.661 --> 44:19.302
I interviewed him.

44:19.422 --> 44:25.411
And by the way, quickly, his defense on these charges of what amounted to criminal bibliomania was, guess what?

44:25.812 --> 44:26.373
Insanity.

44:27.795 --> 44:30.720
He mounted a not guilty by reason of insanity defense.

44:31.481 --> 44:32.983
It didn't succeed, but...

44:32.963 --> 44:34.526
My guest is Nicholas Basmanes.

44:34.566 --> 44:39.034
We're talking about bibliomania profiled in his book called A Gentle Madness.

44:39.675 --> 44:50.293
In terms of the books themselves, you portray a lot of these folks as fanatical, but there seems to be a particular charm about books at least 50 years or so older.

44:50.413 --> 44:52.457
Were the books themselves better made then?

44:53.433 --> 44:53.995
Better bound?

44:54.316 --> 44:55.641
Well, I think so.

44:56.204 --> 45:00.239
I like myself to collect a lot of 19th century books, American books.

45:00.902 --> 45:04.455
And at the fair just this weekend in Washington, the Antiquarian Book Fair,

45:04.975 --> 45:06.537
I picked up a book published in 1872.

45:06.998 --> 45:08.681
Wonderful.

45:08.961 --> 45:12.586
No foxing, which, as you know, is kind of like an oxidization.

45:12.667 --> 45:13.628
There are stains.

45:14.329 --> 45:15.391
Magnificent condition.

45:15.411 --> 45:20.118
But you look at books that were printed in 1920, 1930, when they started putting a lot of acid in the paper.

45:20.618 --> 45:21.199
They're terrible.

45:21.340 --> 45:28.350
So, yeah, yes, I do believe that older books were not only printed on better paper, but I think the workmanship itself.

45:28.567 --> 45:29.389
was done by hand.

45:29.429 --> 45:30.831
You'll find wonderful bindings.

45:31.553 --> 45:33.757
However, I also think that they're coming back now.

45:33.777 --> 45:37.965
I think the publishers are now, again, many of them printing on acid-free paper.

45:39.207 --> 45:45.739
And do you ever see the day when we'll get back to leather-bound volumes for anything other than a limited edition?

45:46.200 --> 45:46.341
No.

45:47.082 --> 45:48.024
Too expensive?

45:48.044 --> 45:51.891
It's too expensive, and books are produced and

45:52.377 --> 45:56.941
Great mass in the hundreds of, well, if you're lucky, in the hundreds of thousands.

45:57.041 --> 45:59.443
Not all books, certainly.

45:59.783 --> 46:08.250
One of the legendary collectors, I don't know if he's a bibliomane or not, was Thomas Jefferson, and some might have been surprised to hear that Rosenwald is so revered at the Library of Congress.

46:08.671 --> 46:09.431
What about Jefferson?

46:09.491 --> 46:10.792
What was his role as a collector?

46:10.953 --> 46:19.340
Well, as the Librarian of Congress has said, the soul of the Library of Congress was furnished by Thomas Jefferson.

46:19.440 --> 46:22.182
As you know, during the War of 1812, the British...

46:22.162 --> 46:25.648
sacked Washington, burned the Library of Congress, destroyed all the books.

46:26.569 --> 46:36.745
Jefferson, reading this, offered his extraordinary library for sale to the country at what was even then considered nominal prices.

46:37.647 --> 46:46.060
And when all these books came in, of course, prior to this also, the Library of Congress was really strictly that, a library for the congressmen.

46:46.681 --> 46:51.248
Now all of a sudden you are getting these books in Greek, in French, the classics.

46:51.268 --> 47:02.005
And he provided a course for the new library to truly make it an international library on the grand scale, the equal of the British Library and the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Vatican Library.

47:02.205 --> 47:05.550
How many of the original Jefferson books remain in the library, do you know?

47:06.408 --> 47:12.114
There were, I think, about 2,500 or so, don't hold me to that, that came up.

47:12.154 --> 47:21.044
But there was quite a catastrophic fire some years afterwards, and I don't know the precise number, but I think about a third of them remained.

47:21.064 --> 47:30.875
But it was the symbolic gesture as much as anything else because it did put the Library of Congress on a new course, a more expansive course.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.597
I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington.

47:32.677 --> 47:34.980
This is Primetime Radio.

47:35.129 --> 47:39.795
In your book, you talk about a lot of private collections that have gone into institutional hands.

47:39.875 --> 47:47.806
Libraries around the world have possessed these books, particularly a fascinating story about how the University of Texas bought most of the world's fine books.

47:48.627 --> 47:56.257
For the average reader, if he or she would like to see, touch, or even read some of these books, how accessible are they?

47:57.880 --> 47:58.200
Well...

47:59.834 --> 48:01.496
Not very, I guess.

48:01.776 --> 48:12.890
If you're a scholar, you can go to any of these institutions, and if you present a legitimate reason for seeing these books, there are manuscripts.

48:13.071 --> 48:23.924
In the case of Texas, they certainly have a lot of books, but the greatness of the Texas collection is in its acquisition of 20th century manuscripts and letters, and it's just preeminent.

48:24.545 --> 48:26.027
But to answer your question,

48:26.699 --> 48:28.442
And perhaps it's as it should be.

48:28.722 --> 48:31.507
You can't just go and touch these things because they are fragile.

48:31.667 --> 48:34.131
They are going to fall apart unless you have a reason to do so.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.295
You have touched and read a Gutenberg, correct?

48:36.615 --> 48:43.747
Well, I haven't read a Gutenberg, but I certainly did touch one, and it was one of the great moments of my life.

48:44.328 --> 48:47.934
And this is the only privately owned Gutenberg in the world now.

48:47.994 --> 48:51.660
It's owned by a New Jersey collector, William Scheidey.

48:52.180 --> 48:55.969
who's arguably the finest private collector in the world.

48:56.069 --> 48:59.096
I mean, the Gutenberg Bible is just the crown jewel.

48:59.637 --> 49:08.839
But when I interviewed him at his Princeton, New Jersey library, he said he's in his 80s now, and he went to his safe and brought out this big

49:09.359 --> 49:28.448
clamshell box I said let me help you sir he said no you sit down over there and then when he opened this I know instantly what it was because it is in its original binding and I had my tape recorder running and you can hear it if you listen to the tape are you okay I said I am a bit lightheaded sir and

49:28.833 --> 49:40.175
He allowed me the moment to savor, and then I sat with him for about a half an hour as he just went through the book and pointed out the wonderful characteristics of this book.

49:40.215 --> 49:48.411
And I touched basically where metal type bit into paper for the first time, and it was quite a moving experience for me.

49:48.391 --> 49:57.223
On the other hand, Bill Gates of Microsoft recently bought a Codex Hammer, then called the Codex Hammer, later renamed, for $30.7 million.

49:57.404 --> 50:02.931
And it said just last week, I believe, he's going to exhibit the book throughout Italy.

50:03.392 --> 50:04.093
Which is nice.

50:04.333 --> 50:07.458
What makes a book worth $30.7 million?

50:08.479 --> 50:16.170
Well, the fact that this book in particular is, we call it a book, but that's kind of an understatement when you think that it's the 72-page book.

50:16.150 --> 50:41.685
notebook of Leonardo da Vinci and this is a book in his handwriting in his characteristic backwards style with many many of his wonderful drawings and experiments and I attended that auction incidentally and the pre-sale estimate was for 11 million and there was a whole contingent of Italian bankers there hoping to bring this back to Italy as a national treasure

50:42.053 --> 50:45.565
And I think that's one of the reasons why Gates is planning to let it go back.

50:45.605 --> 50:47.211
But they were planning to spend.

50:47.231 --> 50:48.997
They figured the pre-sale was $11 million.

50:49.057 --> 50:49.719
Well, okay.

50:50.181 --> 50:52.047
If we have $25 million, we'll get it.

50:52.735 --> 50:53.076
No.

50:53.296 --> 50:53.616
Wow.

50:53.957 --> 50:59.927
I don't know what $28 million is for Bill Gates, probably a day's pay, but he was able to carry the day.

51:00.688 --> 51:05.837
We don't have too much more time, but I did want to touch on the interesting fact that we've spoken mostly about men collectors.

51:05.857 --> 51:07.459
There have been some very famous women.

51:07.540 --> 51:18.658
One particularly, and my favorite, other than Cleopatra, who it turns out was a collector, is Ruth Baldwin, who collected children's books, but she wouldn't allow children to touch them.

51:19.482 --> 51:20.644
It is true.

51:21.105 --> 51:24.652
Ruth's collection now, Ruth has passed away a couple years ago.

51:25.554 --> 51:37.037
And basically, the University of Florida in Gainesville, where this collection now resides, had to wait until Ruth, even after she retired, she was still the boss.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.018
I mean, she came in.

51:38.059 --> 51:40.343
She kept her desk literally at the door.

51:40.913 --> 51:43.598
And kids couldn't come in and use these.

51:43.658 --> 51:46.082
And she didn't even want students to come in and use the books.

51:46.603 --> 51:50.871
Okay, eccentric perhaps, but now what does the University of Florida have?

51:50.891 --> 51:55.699
100,000 children's books, American and British.

51:56.017 --> 52:01.363
from three centuries, including golden books, more golden books than there probably are anyplace else.

52:01.723 --> 52:08.010
What a resource for a scholar now who wants to write about children's literature and the kinds of things that children grew up learning.

52:08.210 --> 52:10.132
As long as the scholar is over 18.

52:10.492 --> 52:15.378
Well, again, now these belong to everyone, not just Ruth.

52:16.058 --> 52:19.682
Your favorite collector, large or small, the favorite story of all.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.806
Well, you mean in the book?

52:22.926 --> 52:25.028
Yeah, or anybody you've met.

52:25.531 --> 52:27.721
We've got about 30 seconds for your favorite one.

52:29.027 --> 52:34.191
Oh, one we haven't even touched on, Chapter 6, Haven No More Because He Remains a Mystery.

52:34.677 --> 52:36.560
And that is my mystery story in the book.

52:37.080 --> 52:45.512
And I did get a letter from a reader in Minnesota, a member of the Baker Street Irregulars, and he loved it as a mystery story, and he was trying to figure out the clues.

52:46.473 --> 52:47.094
I wrote him back.

52:47.394 --> 52:47.975
Nice try.

52:48.035 --> 52:50.459
You know, I think you may have it, but I don't have it either.

52:50.919 --> 52:55.145
If you have the solution to who Haven O'Moore was, let us know.

52:55.165 --> 52:58.109
And write to Nicholas Basbaines, who's been our delightful guest.

52:58.490 --> 53:03.857
His book is A Gentle Madness, Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

53:03.837 --> 53:06.237
Something we all share here on Primetime Radio.

53:06.258 --> 53:07.246
Nick, thanks for being our guest.

53:07.266 --> 53:08.093
Thank you very much, Mike.

53:09.355 --> 53:12.579
We'd like to hear your reactions to all or any of our primetime programs.

53:13.019 --> 53:15.222
We've set up a toll-free number for your calls, 1-800-424-9343.

53:15.242 --> 53:18.486
That's 800-424-9343.

53:21.469 --> 53:25.594
Cassettes of any primetime radio programs can be ordered for $4 each at the same number.

53:26.175 --> 53:28.558
Primetime Radio is a production of AARP.

53:28.918 --> 53:31.802
The show is produced by John Myers and engineered by Brian Hemler.

53:32.202 --> 53:34.225
Our associate producer is Janelle Haskell.

53:34.245 --> 53:35.446
I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington.

53:35.666 --> 53:37.168
Hope you'll listen again next week.

53:37.351 --> 54:03.124
Smoking is a truly addictive behavior.

54:03.144 --> 54:05.046
It's not just a nasty habit.

54:05.110 --> 54:07.996
Hello, I'm Jim Harriot with the weekend edition of Mature Focus.

54:08.216 --> 54:10.942
Today, keeping the resolve to stop smoking.

54:12.004 --> 54:13.607
I'm a fellow with a heart of gold.

54:13.667 --> 54:18.377
The ways of a gentleman, I've been told, the kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea.

54:18.543 --> 54:24.811
But if me and a certain character met that guy that invented that cigarette, I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree.

54:24.831 --> 54:33.362
That's Phil Harris poking fun in the smoking habit, but it's a serious subject, especially for Dr. Larry Lothman, a cancer control researcher at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine.

54:33.903 --> 54:36.747
A former smoker himself, he sympathizes with those trying to quit.

54:37.107 --> 54:38.128
He has some tips for you.

54:38.389 --> 54:44.837
Before lighting up any cigarettes, just look at those reasons and make sure that you're clear about where your head is with regard to wanting to quit.

54:44.885 --> 54:47.368
You have to want to quit and not to do it for somebody else.

54:47.488 --> 54:48.149
Exactly so.

54:48.449 --> 54:50.772
He says people get angry and oppositional.

54:51.132 --> 55:01.365
I once taught a stop smoking class at a business that was instituting a smoke-free policy, and this one lady refused to do anything that we suggested in the class.

55:01.385 --> 55:02.866
And I said, well, do you want to stop smoking?

55:03.347 --> 55:08.513
And she said, oh, yes, I want to stop smoking, but I'll be darned if I'm going to do so just because the company is telling me to do so.

55:08.678 --> 55:12.762
Dr. Loughman says it's really important to focus on your personal reasons for wanting to quit.

55:12.963 --> 55:14.885
Mark Twain said that quitting was easy.

55:14.945 --> 55:16.086
He's done it a thousand times.

55:17.087 --> 55:20.511
The issue, as any smoker will tell you, is not quitting.

55:20.571 --> 55:21.932
The issue is staying quit.

55:21.952 --> 55:26.557
It hurts so much to stop, and it's so easy to start again, no matter how long you've been off cigarettes.

55:26.577 --> 55:31.803
My champion in one of my classes once went ten years without smoking.

55:31.983 --> 55:32.684
Ten years?

55:32.804 --> 55:34.686
That's right, and then started smoking again.

55:34.750 --> 55:40.320
Dr. Lothman strongly suggests that you make a list of situations where you enjoy cigarettes and try to avoid them.

55:40.340 --> 55:46.472
Some people do so when they're stressed or angry or sometimes it's after the good meal or it's at a party and there's a little bit of alcohol flowing.

55:46.732 --> 55:48.556
Oh, with a cup of coffee is always a favorite time?

55:48.596 --> 55:49.938
Always very much so, that's right.

55:50.038 --> 55:52.102
There are two faces to the challenge of quitting.

55:52.463 --> 55:56.370
One of them is the physical addiction, the physiological craving for nicotine.

55:56.671 --> 55:59.234
When you get it into your system, it feels good.

55:59.655 --> 56:04.841
When you get low on it in your bloodstream, it starts feeling bad because you're essentially going into withdrawal.

56:05.081 --> 56:09.447
The other is the psychological craving, as with the man who lit up again ten years later.

56:09.727 --> 56:15.694
Months or years down the line, I'm in that situation, and suddenly I want a cigarette, and I don't even know why sometimes.

56:16.115 --> 56:18.337
Well, you know that that's not nicotine talking anymore.

56:18.397 --> 56:21.081
That's the psychological side of the addictive behavior.

56:21.101 --> 56:24.585
If you can quit, the physical craving usually stops after the first few days.

56:24.852 --> 56:30.278
We tell people typically the nicotine is out of your system within three to five days of quitting.

56:30.718 --> 56:39.287
Now, that may be the worst week of your life, but at least starting around day four or so, for most people, the physical unpleasantness starts easing up.

56:39.507 --> 56:42.390
As I mentioned, Dr. Loffman quit smoking almost 25 years ago.

56:42.710 --> 56:46.014
Several of his friends decided to quit, but not wanting to go along with the crowd.

56:46.254 --> 56:47.335
He didn't, not then.

56:47.375 --> 56:50.218
They started smoking again, and when all of them were smoking,

56:50.350 --> 56:54.256
I decided to quit because, there again, I didn't want to do what everybody else wanted to do.

56:54.276 --> 56:56.419
You are a true loner, Doctor.

56:56.439 --> 57:01.145
On a more serious note, he's concerned about the increase in the number of women smoking and the fallout from that.

57:01.446 --> 57:09.878
Since 1987, lung cancer has been the leading cause of death due to cancer for women as opposed to breast cancer.

57:09.959 --> 57:14.045
Breast cancer remains the number one cause of cancer deaths in women, but lung cancer is on the rise.

57:14.446 --> 57:17.971
Dr. Loffman says smoking for men was usually presented as a macho thing.

57:18.312 --> 57:20.435
The ads aimed at women take a much different approach.

57:20.916 --> 57:26.044
When you look at the pictures, the women are always very thin and glamorous and high society and that kind of thing.

57:26.345 --> 57:29.148
and therefore the model, you're cool if you smoke.

57:29.408 --> 57:34.773
And he has disdained for those tobacco company executives who told the Congressional Committee they believed cigarettes were not harmful.

57:35.013 --> 57:43.081
I'm obviously not an unbiased source with regard to the tobacco companies, but it was disingenuous at best, and they were outright fibbing at worst.

57:43.101 --> 57:54.992
Just ahead, alternatives to smoking that help, and the good news about quitting.

57:55.012 --> 57:55.052
¶¶

57:56.939 --> 58:01.144
Dr. Larry Loffman says he still carries a pack of sugar-free gum in case things get tense.

58:01.164 --> 58:02.526
Breath mints and candy help too.

58:02.806 --> 58:06.251
Then for the seriously addicted, there's the nicotine patch.

58:06.271 --> 58:11.257
What it effectively is doing is giving you nicotine while you're breaking the habit of smoking.

58:11.577 --> 58:14.080
And the good news for older, long-time smokers.

58:14.421 --> 58:17.084
The moment you stop smoking, your body starts healing itself.

58:17.565 --> 58:22.931
And within a few years, your risk of those terrible diseases goes back down to almost that of a person who never smoked.

58:22.951 --> 58:24.073
So it's never too late to stop.

58:24.153 --> 58:26.676
It's literally never too late and never too early to stop.

58:26.825 --> 58:32.156
Dr. Loffman says it may take three, four, or five times before you kick the cigarette habit, but don't give up.

58:35.183 --> 58:42.979
That's the weekend edition of Mature Focus, a production of AARP, brought to you in part by Buick, the new symbol for quality in America.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.745
Until next time, I'm Jim Harriet in Washington.
