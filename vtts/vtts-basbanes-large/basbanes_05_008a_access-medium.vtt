WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:04.368
and then we're talking to Robert Greer.

00:05.970 --> 00:14.702
Bob, I won't just chat, okay, and I know a lot about your background, but why don't you give me a little bit of the biography?

00:14.722 --> 00:28.401
You graduated college in 65, but I think the fact that you are a physician and you do work in pathology and how this led to the creation of this character.

00:28.668 --> 00:33.733
Yeah, well, I went to school in Ohio, finished Miami University in Ohio, and I had a dual major.

00:33.753 --> 00:38.417
I majored in English journalism and zoology.

00:38.477 --> 00:49.827
So it turns out that I sort of brought all those things back into play when I developed the character for the novels that I'm working on that are the C.J.

00:49.847 --> 00:56.413
Floyd mystery novels because I wanted to try and bring the English and journalism background that I had back into

00:56.950 --> 01:26.215
into play but I didn't do it until I was in my late 40s because I didn't really get a chance because I was practicing as a pathologist all that time in between so I finally did I went back to Boston University and got a degree in creative writing from Boston University when I took a sabbatical from the university in the 1980s really tried to hone my skills in writing and I wrote a bunch of short stories after that and the stories

01:26.515 --> 01:31.342
I'd received some notoriety, so I got my name out there as a short story writer.

01:32.144 --> 01:34.267
And after that, I decided to write novels.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.792
I sat down initially to write a straight medical thriller.

01:38.934 --> 01:40.456
A la Robin Cook.

01:40.477 --> 01:44.683
Yeah, in the Robin Cook or Michael Crichton mode.

01:44.703 --> 01:50.532
But what I found out is I could not do it, and the reason was because it was too much like work.

01:50.900 --> 02:01.398
I do a lot of recombinant DNA, molecular biology research at work, and I was just bringing that home at night and writing about it, and it bored me, and it was going to bore the reader.

02:02.359 --> 02:04.883
That's a very interesting point, yeah.

02:05.304 --> 02:09.972
What worked for me was the mystery, because I could put the mystery as the front story.

02:10.492 --> 02:13.758
and make the so-called medical thriller the backstory.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.203
And that's what works for me in each one of my novels.

02:16.223 --> 02:21.252
But that also gives you the verisimilitude, you know, the stuff that you know.

02:21.413 --> 02:21.813
Yeah.

02:21.833 --> 02:22.334
Yeah.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.298
It helps because I don't have to go...

02:25.088 --> 02:27.692
spend countless hours in the library.

02:27.712 --> 02:28.413
Great-looking things.

02:28.433 --> 02:33.820
Yeah, well, I mean, the way you open the devil's red nickel, I mean, this is home turf for you.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.482
Yeah, it starts in a morgue.

02:35.563 --> 02:36.183
That's what I'm saying.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.548
The biscuits are coming down.

02:39.568 --> 02:40.690
It's a six-biscuit day.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.853
Is that talk, by the way, biscuits?

02:42.873 --> 02:43.674
They call them biscuits?

02:43.934 --> 02:46.458
No, in fact, they don't do that.

02:46.598 --> 02:48.681
In reality, I made that up.

02:48.721 --> 02:49.702
That's fiction.

02:49.822 --> 02:53.948
I didn't... They don't refer to bodies as biscuits.

02:54.282 --> 02:59.589
But I thought it was an interesting first line, and so I sort of set it up that way.

02:59.609 --> 03:09.202
And then I also started with a minor character to start the novel as opposed to a major character, but a very striking sort of minor character that would stay in your mind.

03:11.666 --> 03:11.986
Okay.

03:13.929 --> 03:14.530
Bob?

03:14.550 --> 03:14.650
Yeah.

03:14.670 --> 03:18.015
Okay, I interrupted, so why don't you continue with what you were saying earlier.

03:18.275 --> 03:19.817
Yeah, so...

03:20.658 --> 03:33.509
After I found out the medical thriller stuff wouldn't quite work, I put it as the back story, and as I said, that sort of formula for mystery and what the medical thriller subplot works for me, and so that's the way I've been writing the novels.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.451
I came up with C.J.

03:35.471 --> 03:44.038
Floyd as a central character because I knew a little bit about bail bonding.

03:44.098 --> 03:49.703
I read about it, and it interested me, and so I came up with a character...

03:50.122 --> 03:53.189
who would have a different slant than a typical private eye.

03:53.209 --> 03:59.223
I think that's been done so much, I just didn't want to produce another person like that.

03:59.724 --> 04:02.611
And I wanted somebody who was a little bit more offbeat.

04:02.631 --> 04:06.780
So the central character is a bail bondsman and a bounty hunter, and he's a Vietnam vet who's

04:07.638 --> 04:10.163
got that baggage of war to carry around with him.

04:10.223 --> 04:12.447
He's a loner and a very principled man.

04:13.329 --> 04:20.322
And, of course, the thing that I always get asked about is, you know, how did you come up with black characters or African-American characters?

04:20.342 --> 04:21.624
Of course I did, because I'm black.

04:21.724 --> 04:25.932
So I wanted to put those people in the lead story.

04:26.093 --> 04:28.697
I wonder who'd ask that question.

04:28.717 --> 04:29.038
I mean...

04:29.018 --> 04:33.966
I wonder how it's like me coming up with a Greek character.

04:34.166 --> 04:34.807
Yeah, right.

04:34.827 --> 04:40.115
It would be like, why would you come up with a character that you had some familiarity with?

04:40.136 --> 04:41.478
Especially the idiom, too.

04:42.359 --> 04:43.140
But go ahead.

04:43.160 --> 04:47.066
But anyway, I came up with him, and I wanted him to be the central lead role.

04:47.086 --> 04:54.418
I wanted a guy who had some flaws, but a person who was very, very principled and really...

04:55.057 --> 04:59.944
took the high road in defining for himself differences between right and wrong.

05:01.005 --> 05:11.119
A person who was reticent about having relationships with women, but was the kind of person who could care deeply about other people.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.584
So that's the way I came up with the idea for him.

05:14.918 --> 05:16.640
It's worked for me so far.

05:16.921 --> 05:23.809
Yeah, well, plus he can, the nature of his profession allows him to move freely, I think, between groups.

05:24.390 --> 05:30.057
You know, if you're a cop, ostensibly, you do have, you know, Miranda warnings you have to give and stuff like that.

05:30.097 --> 05:34.322
And a lawyer has been done and all this other stuff.

05:34.342 --> 05:38.127
But this guy can really kind of move freely, I think.

05:38.307 --> 05:44.335
Yeah, well, that was part of the reason I also chose him, because he can do that without somebody...

05:44.517 --> 05:46.321
immediately slamming him in jail.

05:46.361 --> 05:51.332
And they do have unbelievable powers as bail bondsmen that a lot of people don't know about.

05:51.372 --> 05:56.483
They can handcuff you to the back of their pickup truck and take you right down to the jail.

05:56.543 --> 05:58.647
Yeah, and they can cross state lines freely, too.

05:58.668 --> 05:59.389
Oh, absolutely.

05:59.710 --> 06:00.171
Absolutely.

06:00.672 --> 06:03.538
As cops, you know, and they get in trouble every once in a while.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.629
for nailing the wrong person.

06:08.231 --> 06:08.892
And they've done that.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.714
So how about the story?

06:10.734 --> 06:12.656
You know, I mean, so you went back to school.

06:12.957 --> 06:17.722
You've been practicing medicine now for, what, 25 years?

06:18.383 --> 06:19.885
Yeah, 25 years.

06:21.767 --> 06:26.453
But there's always, we have the storytelling aspect of it.

06:26.513 --> 06:27.834
Where does that come from?

06:27.874 --> 06:31.739
I mean, because obviously that's at the center of what you're doing here.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.580
We can have all the...

06:33.404 --> 06:59.665
all the detail in the world but you still have to have number one the character and number two the story. Yeah well I came up with sort of storytelling because lots of people in my family were storytellers. I had had uncles that used to love to tell stories, and many other people in my family where I grew up in Ohio and then Gary, Indiana were were farmers, mainly in Ohio.

07:00.134 --> 07:01.736
And they would sit around and tell stories.

07:01.756 --> 07:03.519
So I think that that's where that comes from.

07:05.261 --> 07:06.443
What kinds of stories?

07:06.743 --> 07:09.047
Family stories, oral tradition stories?

07:09.067 --> 07:12.632
Yeah, a lot of them were just sort of oral tradition family stories.

07:12.672 --> 07:27.413
Stories about the family and where they came from and where they worked and how they moved from North Carolina up into Ohio and became coal miners in West Virginia and Ohio.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.736
And then how they became farmers and

07:30.307 --> 07:32.370
I had an uncle, though, who's a famous chef.

07:33.031 --> 07:33.532
No kidding.

07:33.552 --> 07:34.013
Where was this?

07:34.093 --> 07:38.439
In New York during the Harlem Renaissance.

07:38.460 --> 07:43.627
And so they used to like to talk about how he ate himself to death.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.731
You know, just tales like that.

07:46.051 --> 07:46.251
Yeah.

07:46.892 --> 07:49.817
And so I guess that's where it came from.

07:49.837 --> 07:53.783
The other thing, the other place that the real...

07:54.016 --> 08:04.353
background for storytelling and writing comes from is my parents were teachers, both of my parents, my mother and father, and they really were avid readers.

08:05.034 --> 08:12.666
So people often seem to think that writers come from a background where they write all the time, and I just don't

08:12.933 --> 08:39.160
find that to be true. I think it's much more people come right who come from a background where they read all the time. Well I couldn't agree more by the way. Uh that's that's just element of the new book that I'm writing. I'm really looking at the readers. No really? Yeah this well I'm writing about book culture you know uh, and all it's and all it's on the eve of a new millennium, you know the aspects, but you don't want to hear that stuff, but

08:39.140 --> 08:41.363
But reading, of course, is elemental.

08:41.403 --> 08:42.645
Now, tell me about your parents.

08:42.725 --> 08:43.626
Where did they teach?

08:44.187 --> 08:51.417
My father was a teacher, a high school teacher, and then a principal in Gary, Indiana, when I was growing up.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.820
And my mother was a teacher, too.

08:53.880 --> 09:01.811
And then she only taught a brief time, though, after my brother was born, or their second child.

09:02.272 --> 09:05.957
Then she quit teaching to raise her family full-time.

09:06.359 --> 09:22.380
But then my father went from being principal of a high school to move back to Ohio, back to Columbus, when I was out of college, and he became the assistant superintendent of schools for the state.

09:23.361 --> 09:32.653
And so he was a man who was heavily into the educational system and a very literate man who really thought reading books

09:32.785 --> 09:34.488
Very important, just as my mother did.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.389
What was his name?

09:36.311 --> 09:36.631
Robert.

09:37.072 --> 09:38.154
Yeah, Robert Greer.

09:38.454 --> 09:39.035
I'm a junior.

09:39.176 --> 09:39.917
You're a junior?

09:40.878 --> 09:41.359
Yeah.

09:41.399 --> 09:42.781
Where did he go to school?

09:43.402 --> 09:49.813
Went to a small black college in West Virginia called Bluefield State Teachers.

09:49.853 --> 09:50.654
Bluefield?

09:51.155 --> 09:57.105
That was back when the black colleges really were very separate and there were lots of them.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.895
Well, it's when black people couldn't get into regular colleges.

09:59.915 --> 10:00.576
Oh, absolutely.

10:00.596 --> 10:01.917
And then he went on from there.

10:02.538 --> 10:05.580
Then he went on to Ohio State and got his master's and Ph.D.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.601
from Ohio State.

10:06.621 --> 10:09.624
So that's the Ohio connection.

10:10.105 --> 10:13.608
This is great because the Columbus Dispatch will use this story.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.470
So that's wonderful.

10:16.651 --> 10:17.672
Are your parents alive?

10:18.012 --> 10:18.733
My dad's not.

10:18.793 --> 10:20.394
My dad's dead.

10:20.434 --> 10:22.996
And my mother's still alive, still lives in Columbus.

10:23.016 --> 10:23.317
Oh, good.

10:23.337 --> 10:23.817
What's your name?

10:23.977 --> 10:24.798
Her name's Mary.

10:25.639 --> 10:25.759
And

10:26.566 --> 10:28.228
Mary Greer, does she use a middle name?

10:28.268 --> 10:31.091
Yeah, she uses Angie.

10:31.111 --> 10:32.793
That's what people have called her all her life.

10:33.214 --> 10:36.358
So is it Mary Greer, you know, A-N-G-I-E?

10:36.598 --> 10:37.078
Yeah.

10:37.099 --> 10:37.659
Okay, good.

10:37.799 --> 10:38.740
And she lives in Columbus?

10:38.981 --> 10:39.882
Yeah, she lives in Columbus.

10:39.902 --> 10:40.823
Any other family there?

10:41.223 --> 10:42.165
Oh, yeah.

10:42.465 --> 10:45.068
All my family on my mother's side live in Columbus.

10:46.670 --> 10:49.333
She had seven brothers and sisters.

10:49.769 --> 10:53.975
And they all still, the ones that are still alive live in Columbus.

10:54.115 --> 10:55.978
They've always lived there all their lives.

10:55.998 --> 10:57.019
So she's from Columbus.

10:57.099 --> 10:57.399
Oh, yeah.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.060
She's from there.

10:59.963 --> 11:00.063
Okay.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.587
So now let's talk about The Devil's Red Nickel.

11:02.647 --> 11:04.910
Tell me a little bit about the titles of both your books.

11:05.150 --> 11:05.250
Yeah.

11:05.270 --> 11:10.938
Well, the titles that I choose are titles that all have something to do with American history.

11:11.399 --> 11:15.665
And I think some people look at the titles and say, well, there's that word, the devil, trying to catch your eye.

11:15.705 --> 11:18.228
But in reality, what I'm trying to catch is your conscience.

11:19.149 --> 11:19.590
And the

11:20.093 --> 11:30.114
The Devil's Hat Band, which is the first novel, comes from the historical element of barbed wire.

11:30.254 --> 11:35.425
In the West, barbed wire in the 1870s and 60s was hated.

11:35.565 --> 11:37.950
Ranchers didn't like it because it fenced off the West.

11:38.386 --> 11:42.070
So they couldn't run their cattle anywhere they wanted and they couldn't get free eat.

11:42.090 --> 11:43.372
They couldn't let them eat for free.

11:43.392 --> 11:47.496
And so they hated barbed wire because it fenced off the West for them.

11:47.756 --> 11:49.779
Can you say this as a rancher, by the way?

11:49.959 --> 11:50.620
Yeah.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.080
Oh, yeah.

11:51.100 --> 11:51.801
I am a rancher.

11:52.942 --> 11:53.283
Go ahead.

11:53.323 --> 11:53.683
Continue.

11:53.923 --> 12:06.317
So and then The Devil's Red Nickel, which the new novel, that title stems from a practice that was a practice in the 1950s in which the organized crime controlled

12:06.938 --> 12:08.460
The jukebox industry.

12:08.941 --> 12:15.229
So what they would do is they'd go to an establishment where jukeboxes were prominent as they were at that time.

12:15.669 --> 12:22.097
And then they'd make the proprietor use red impregnated nickels or slugs, whichever one they wanted to use.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.180
And then the proprietor would give those to the patrons.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.241
The patrons would use those.

12:25.261 --> 12:26.483
They'd play all the records.

12:27.222 --> 12:36.312
And then they'd come back at the end of the month and they'd pull out all those slugs that were impregnated with the red dye or the red nickel and take a cut out of every one of those.

12:36.892 --> 12:43.019
If you played one, you know, 10 times, then the organized crime got 80% of it.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.821
You got 10, 20%.

12:44.861 --> 12:47.864
So you'd get a penny or 20 cents maybe on the nickel.

12:48.365 --> 12:50.367
And many may say, well, that's not very much.

12:50.447 --> 12:51.508
It is if you're playing...

12:51.927 --> 12:57.879
If you've got thousands and thousands of jukeboxes and they're playing thousands of records, then you can make a lot of money that way.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.485
Wow, that's the way McDonald's makes money on hamburgers.

13:01.026 --> 13:02.749
Absolutely.

13:02.769 --> 13:06.677
They don't make money selling you one hamburger.

13:06.697 --> 13:07.319
No, they don't.

13:07.339 --> 13:12.349
Apparently when you decided that you wanted to write fiction, I mean, you didn't do it...

13:12.633 --> 13:21.845
Hastily, I mean, it sounds to me like you really gave it a lot of thought, measured precisely how you were going to go about it.

13:22.025 --> 13:25.550
I mean, you didn't go plunging into the writing of a book.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.672
You went back to school.

13:26.712 --> 13:28.674
Did school help you, by the way?

13:29.235 --> 13:30.517
Yeah, school helped me a lot.

13:30.577 --> 13:35.383
I learned in a very specific fashion, and I think everybody does.

13:35.887 --> 13:41.234
A lot of people will say, well, writers learn in the, quote, what they call bohemian style.

13:41.254 --> 13:48.443
They hang out with other writers, and they talk in coffee shops, and they discuss the world and the world of writing, and then out of that comes literature.

13:49.184 --> 13:50.786
I don't learn in that.

13:50.966 --> 13:52.328
No, but it's a good way to get grants.

13:52.568 --> 13:55.812
It's a way to justify getting a grant, I think.

13:55.832 --> 13:56.794
Well, I never have been.

13:56.814 --> 13:59.237
Neither have I. We work for everything we get, I think.

13:59.818 --> 14:00.218
Go ahead.

14:00.438 --> 14:03.362
Somebody has to teach me something.

14:03.697 --> 14:13.313
And whether it's the craft of writing or the craft of pathology or the craft of zoology or whatever the things I've tried to be involved in, I've had good teachers.

14:13.413 --> 14:27.797
And so when I decided I really wanted to write seriously again, I figured out how I could go back to one of the creative writing programs where you could get a master's, which is one of the standard kind of education programs in the country.

14:28.688 --> 14:32.873
get a good teacher who could try and help me become a better writer.

14:32.893 --> 14:33.554
And so I did.

14:33.594 --> 14:34.975
I went back to Boston University.

14:34.995 --> 14:36.397
They had a good program.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.641
And it's the program in which Leslie Epstein's the head.

14:39.681 --> 14:48.672
And then Derek Walcott, who won the Nobel Prize for poetry two, three years ago, was the head of the poetry section.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.194
So they had outstanding teachers.

14:50.434 --> 14:55.780
And I just happened to go to there because I'd gone to professional school there.

14:56.301 --> 14:58.223
Did you take some courses with Walcott?

14:58.777 --> 14:59.558
Did I do one?

14:59.758 --> 15:03.403
Did you take any courses with Walcott or Derek Walcott?

15:03.683 --> 15:04.785
No, I didn't.

15:05.025 --> 15:10.172
Actually, I didn't because what happened was the poetry and the fiction.

15:10.232 --> 15:13.276
There were three segments to it, poetry, fiction, and drama.

15:14.157 --> 15:21.026
And if you were a fiction writer major like me, you could cross over and take some poetry or drama.

15:21.046 --> 15:21.747
And I did.

15:22.132 --> 15:27.420
But Walcott's courses were so full that everybody signed up for them.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.265
If you couldn't get there right at the beginning, you couldn't get them.

15:31.286 --> 15:32.607
And so I never did.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.271
I signed up for them and never could get in the course.

15:35.291 --> 15:44.645
They say it's almost the same with, I mean, John Silver has really brought some extraordinary people over to BU, but it's almost impossible to get into their classes.

15:44.665 --> 15:45.186
Yeah, that's true.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.376
But anyway, go ahead.

15:47.396 --> 15:47.897
I'm sorry.

15:48.177 --> 15:50.480
So anyway, I was in that program.

15:50.980 --> 16:00.830
Actually, the guy Epstein is just as interesting because he's the head of the fiction writing section, and he grew up in Hollywood.

16:00.850 --> 16:03.572
His father and uncle wrote Casablanca.

16:03.592 --> 16:03.993
Okay.

16:07.116 --> 16:09.238
I think Mr. Smith Comes to Washington.

16:09.258 --> 16:15.544
Some of those old famous classic movies were written by his uncle and father who were 18.

16:15.963 --> 16:25.112
back when Warner and MGM, those studios, used to really have control of writers and actors and stuff.

16:25.132 --> 16:27.574
And so he was a good teacher.

16:27.614 --> 16:32.539
And so I learned from him, and I came back and started to write short stories after that.

16:32.599 --> 16:33.580
This was actually 1989.

16:35.182 --> 16:37.063
And my stories were better than they were before.

16:37.103 --> 16:41.468
They were actually good enough to get published in some high-quality literary magazines.

16:41.548 --> 16:42.949
What were some of the magazines?

16:43.165 --> 16:51.857
A.T.N.I., which is a real high-profile magazine that comes out of Boston University, in fact.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.544
I had stories published in Writers' Forum, which is a Western.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.006
I know them.

16:59.447 --> 17:07.317
And New Mexico Humanities Review and the Black American Literature Forum out of Indiana.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.261
That's where you start.

17:09.442 --> 17:10.647
Great, yeah.

17:10.728 --> 17:15.670
Yeah, they were good, solid literary magazines out of high-profile universities.

17:16.291 --> 17:24.345
So I got some luck with that, and that helped me because then my name became known, so I could get an agent.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.288
Otherwise, it's real difficult to get an agent.

17:26.448 --> 17:28.211
I know the drill.

17:28.231 --> 17:28.672
Yeah.

17:28.692 --> 17:34.722
So after I got, you know, with that short story background, I was able to get an agent, and then he was able to sell the first novel.

17:34.942 --> 17:35.483
Who's the agent?

17:35.964 --> 17:37.266
His name is Nat Sobel.

17:37.747 --> 17:38.649
S-O-B-E-L.

17:38.669 --> 17:38.829
Uh-huh.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.630
Yeah, he's well known.

17:39.831 --> 17:40.071
Yeah.

17:40.827 --> 17:41.668
Okay.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.473
Now, tell me a little bit.

17:44.513 --> 17:48.179
You told me about the thought that went into the creation of the character.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.122
Who do you see as your reader?

17:52.105 --> 17:57.354
I think I want the reader to be exactly who I made C.J.

17:57.374 --> 17:58.997
I want him to be the corollary of that.

17:59.417 --> 18:00.399
I tried to make C.J.

18:00.419 --> 18:02.262
Floyd every man.

18:03.136 --> 18:07.801
I want the reader to be the same, either every man or every woman.

18:07.901 --> 18:15.669
And by that I mean when I write novels, there seems to me to be a tendency among some of the ethnic writers.

18:16.610 --> 18:26.781
And I don't know that this is true, but there's this idea that the work has to be exclusive, and it can only include a certain community.

18:27.065 --> 18:31.537
And it's almost often what I would call inside writing.

18:31.757 --> 18:37.653
And I don't write like that, don't have any intention to, and it would not interest me if you had to do that.

18:38.134 --> 18:39.879
I want my work to be inclusive.

18:40.581 --> 18:42.947
So when I write it, I'm writing for everyone.

18:43.180 --> 18:48.870
So I'm not writing for black people only or for 45-year-old men only, like C.J.

18:48.930 --> 18:52.958
Floyd happens to be, or for doctors only or for male bondsmen only.

18:52.978 --> 18:55.923
I want it to touch a nerve in everyone.

18:55.943 --> 18:57.466
And so that's my purpose.

18:57.506 --> 19:00.852
And so the community that I want to read my work is the...

19:01.287 --> 19:04.911
broad community of readers who can read it and say, I can relate to this.

19:04.991 --> 19:06.994
This is interesting and enjoyable.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.617
I can pick this up and it's a good read.

19:10.297 --> 19:23.953
And I think, and I like these characters and I don't feel as though I'm kept out because it happens to be a world that revolves centrally around African-American characters.

19:24.440 --> 19:30.709
I think Walter Mosley has succeeded spectacularly in precisely that kind of approach as well.

19:31.831 --> 19:38.621
He has really penetrated all of the reading areas.

19:40.264 --> 19:43.829
Well, Walter certainly opened the doors for people like me.

19:43.909 --> 19:49.317
He was really the first person in the genre to really take off as a black writer.

19:49.297 --> 19:52.300
But interesting enough, there were people before him.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.524
Yeah, but not just the black writer, but I think the character.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.205
Oh, I see what you mean.

19:57.306 --> 19:58.847
The character is appealing.

19:59.108 --> 20:08.217
And you're not writing in an idiom that is impenetrable for readers outside of this knit community.

20:08.257 --> 20:11.220
You're certainly not using eubonics.

20:11.821 --> 20:13.583
No, I don't think so.

20:13.563 --> 20:24.940
and i'm saying that you know with a smile here but you know what i'm saying i mean you're not pitching your work to a specific uh group because it lets you know and if you did

20:25.696 --> 20:27.680
That wouldn't be bad either.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.962
I mean, African Americans.

20:29.023 --> 20:31.527
I did an interview with Henry Louis Gates.

20:31.548 --> 20:34.253
You know, I mean, African Americans buy a lot of books.

20:34.273 --> 20:36.858
Oh, yeah, there's a huge community of readers out there.

20:36.938 --> 20:39.724
I think what happened is the publishers finally figured it out.

20:40.886 --> 20:42.589
That's helped as well.

20:42.850 --> 20:46.557
I think that there was a figure that...

20:46.537 --> 20:50.524
As a reading group, they accounted for 65 million books last year.

20:50.544 --> 20:52.828
I didn't know that.

20:52.848 --> 20:53.348
Good gracious.

20:53.369 --> 20:56.995
Skip Gates has that in his book, The Anthology of African American Literature.

20:57.035 --> 20:58.197
Yeah, I have that book.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.559
That's a great book, by the way.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.945
I did a column on that for Black History Month.

21:03.746 --> 21:05.208
Spectacular book.

21:05.229 --> 21:08.494
Matter of fact, I went over to Harvard and did an interview with him for it.

21:08.474 --> 21:10.056
Let's see.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.742
Tell me a little bit, so what's your schedule?

21:13.762 --> 21:16.386
Are you planning to do like one a year or every other year or what?

21:16.526 --> 21:18.629
Well, right now I'm on one a year.

21:18.669 --> 21:24.237
The third one I'm working on right now, even on the road, I can't stop working on it because it's through July the 1st.

21:24.257 --> 21:26.260
The third one's called The Devil's Backbone.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.285
So The Devil's going to appear in the titles?

21:29.505 --> 21:35.133
Yeah, The Devil will appear in this third book, The Devil's Backbone, and we know that title's already set.

21:35.173 --> 21:36.996
And I just came out of New York.

21:37.702 --> 21:40.065
with my agent and my editors yesterday.

21:40.085 --> 21:41.566
No, yeah, yesterday.

21:41.626 --> 21:53.520
And we'd had dinner the night before and really the thing that they're really interested in me doing is we've discussed writing a straight medical thriller.

21:54.181 --> 21:58.486
And so the fourth book we're toying with whether or not it'll be a C.J.

21:58.586 --> 22:02.270
Floyd mystery or whether it'll be a classic medical thriller.

22:02.330 --> 22:05.734
And part of the reason they want that is because there's

22:06.389 --> 22:08.333
Well, I know.

22:08.353 --> 22:08.874
Big money.

22:10.657 --> 22:12.741
I'd do it in a second if I could.

22:13.062 --> 22:17.270
Yeah, I think that's where the big push is right now.

22:17.570 --> 22:22.800
Whether I'm going to do it and write a straight medical thriller or use Henry Bale.

22:22.820 --> 22:28.110
See, there's a pathologist in the novels who's a friend of CJ's who he was in Vietnam with.

22:28.529 --> 22:34.164
I may push him to the forefront and make the book a medical thriller.

22:34.205 --> 22:36.190
You might just create another series.

22:37.012 --> 22:37.754
It's a debate.

22:38.115 --> 22:44.192
We're trying to figure out which we're going to do, but that's what we're discussing right now for maybe the fourth book.

22:44.898 --> 22:45.679
But that's great.

22:45.819 --> 22:48.002
But you think that all the C.J.

22:48.022 --> 22:50.365
Floyd mysteries will have devil in the title?

22:50.405 --> 22:51.847
Well, the first three only.

22:51.987 --> 22:53.309
After that, I'm not sure.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.692
You're not going to bind yourself to it.

22:55.712 --> 22:57.655
Yeah, I suspect only the first three they do.

22:57.675 --> 23:00.959
You sound like Sue Grafton where you've got 26 letters in the alphabet to go through.

23:00.979 --> 23:06.226
I don't think I can do 26 devils.

23:06.246 --> 23:07.007
That's funny.

23:07.888 --> 23:08.789
I'm a Holt author.

23:10.071 --> 23:14.517
And they said for 1995, my book was the second best-selling book that Holt had.

23:15.070 --> 23:16.092
I said, man, that's great.

23:16.112 --> 23:18.295
They said, unfortunately, the number one was Sue Grafton.

23:18.335 --> 23:21.100
Oh, my God.

23:21.701 --> 23:26.569
She didn't have to look over her shoulder, I can tell you.

23:26.849 --> 23:33.280
If you go in and look in the stores, I mean, she'll have the shelf, maybe a whole shelf, nothing but her books.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.061
So, let's see.

23:34.863 --> 23:35.644
How old are you, Bob?

23:36.333 --> 23:36.934
I'm 53.

23:37.614 --> 23:38.616
My age, precisely.

23:38.736 --> 23:40.137
I'll be 54 next month.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.922
You have a ranch, I think, you told me before.

23:44.222 --> 23:46.544
Yeah, although we live in Denver.

23:47.085 --> 23:51.510
My wife and I live there, and we've lived there, what, 23 years or so.

23:51.550 --> 23:59.539
We've got a cattle ranch about 170 miles northwest of Denver, outside of Steamboat Springs, which is a ski area.

24:00.413 --> 24:01.736
And it's a working cattle ranch.

24:01.756 --> 24:03.639
We really run real cattle up there.

24:03.880 --> 24:08.950
We have black baldy cattle that are crossed between Hereford and Angus, so you get a black cow with a white face.

24:09.971 --> 24:12.096
And it's fun.

24:12.156 --> 24:12.897
I like it.

24:12.937 --> 24:15.642
I've always enjoyed the outdoors.

24:15.683 --> 24:22.135
And as I said, there's some farming in my family background, so I learned to ride and rope and things like that when I was a teenager.

24:22.773 --> 24:25.996
So I was lucky I could do those things when I moved out west.

24:26.077 --> 24:29.440
How many head of cattle do you have to play?

24:29.660 --> 24:30.501
How many head of cattle?

24:31.162 --> 24:34.726
We run between 100 and 125 head at any one time.

24:34.886 --> 24:36.328
So it's a cow-calf operation.

24:36.348 --> 24:43.535
We have the mothers have the calves and then the calves get fat and we sell them in the fall.

24:43.555 --> 24:45.297
So they're all being born right now.

24:45.337 --> 24:52.425
We've got about half of the new calf herd is born because I just talked to my foreman last night.

24:53.131 --> 24:58.318
Then we'll sell them in the fall, and actually the ranch is about 1,500 acres.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.882
That's exciting.

25:00.902 --> 25:01.382
Yeah, it's fun.

25:01.402 --> 25:02.344
How often do you get up there?

25:02.724 --> 25:10.234
I'm up there about every, I'm up there only once a month in the winter because of snows and my other jobs and responsibilities.

25:10.254 --> 25:18.085
But in the summer, we're up there usually two weekends a month, and then we spend some time up there for vacation time.

25:18.446 --> 25:19.066
Do you drive up?

25:19.367 --> 25:20.128
Yeah, we drive.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.670
It's three and a half hours.

25:21.953 --> 25:22.714
You should fly.

25:22.935 --> 25:24.378
Maybe this is flat land, right?

25:25.139 --> 25:26.381
No place to land, probably.

25:26.401 --> 25:26.822
Yep.

25:26.842 --> 25:28.265
Not easy to land up there.

25:28.986 --> 25:33.635
Well, listen, why don't you give me your phone number, you know, back home, if you don't mind.

25:33.655 --> 25:35.519
And if there's any other questions, I'll give you a call.

25:35.539 --> 25:35.719
Oh, yeah.

25:35.819 --> 25:37.963
But I think we've got plenty of stuff here.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.047
In Denver, it's 303.

25:40.972 --> 25:49.983
303-320-6827, and that's work, and home is 303-871-0927.

25:50.243 --> 25:51.344
Okay.

25:53.767 --> 25:56.751
You did mention that you do a literary magazine.

25:56.791 --> 25:58.212
You might give me a little something on that.

25:58.412 --> 26:00.795
Oh, yeah, that's something I'm real proud of.

26:00.835 --> 26:05.501
We started a literary magazine, and by me, I mean my wife and I started it.

26:05.521 --> 26:10.827
We started it in 1986, so it's got a 10-year track record now.

26:11.009 --> 26:21.964
It's called the High Plains Literary Review, and we publish short stories and essays, poetry, interviews with writers, and that sort of stuff, just like a sort of classic university literary magazine.

26:21.984 --> 26:28.734
But we try and make it a cross between the Slicks and the Glossys and the university literary magazine.

26:28.754 --> 26:33.220
So it's a cross between maybe Harper's and Indiana Review or something like that.

26:33.605 --> 26:34.967
It's done good.

26:35.027 --> 26:43.300
What's interesting is I really wanted the short stories to be the thing that drove it that we would really be most proud of.

26:43.360 --> 26:50.010
And we have been because we've had lots of short stories that have been selected as never as

26:50.395 --> 26:52.198
Boy, I take it for an O. Henry Award.

26:52.218 --> 26:54.021
We've had an O. Henry Award-winning show of stories.

26:54.041 --> 26:59.871
But in Best American Show of Stories, we get mentioned in the back all the time in the top 100, but we've never really had one in there.

27:00.292 --> 27:05.721
But our essays, two years in a row, Robert Atwood had just called me about a week ago and said,

27:06.207 --> 27:08.711
You've got another essay that won Best American Essays.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.213
Nothing wrong with that.

27:10.233 --> 27:12.417
No, we've gotten two in a row.

27:12.677 --> 27:15.943
That's really a feather in our cap, so we're very proud of that.

27:15.963 --> 27:17.004
And how often do you publish?

27:17.305 --> 27:18.126
Three times a year.

27:18.827 --> 27:19.849
That's a lot of work, I'll bet.

27:20.109 --> 27:21.952
Yeah, I've got good people helping me, though.

27:21.972 --> 27:26.680
I've got some real top-notch fiction and poetry writers who help.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.142
And do you circulate it?

27:28.162 --> 27:29.785
How is the circulation?

27:30.271 --> 27:32.763
Circulation's about 1,600.

27:33.165 --> 27:33.989
That's pretty good.

27:34.010 --> 27:37.125
Which is good for a literary magazine, but certainly not, you know, they don't

27:37.493 --> 27:38.715
sell like books.

27:38.735 --> 27:41.238
No, but they get around.

27:41.818 --> 27:42.379
They get around.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.181
They get to where they have to get around to.

27:44.562 --> 27:47.025
And if you get a good reputation, then you get good writers.

27:48.286 --> 27:49.848
You'll have to send us something.

27:49.868 --> 27:50.329
I'd love to.

27:51.711 --> 27:55.616
You know, I'm planning to come out to Denver at some point for this new book I'm working on.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.639
Did you mention that you're friendly with John Dunning?

27:59.180 --> 28:01.162
Oh yeah, Dunning's a friend of mine.

28:01.523 --> 28:04.086
I'd love to talk to him for this new book I'm writing.

28:04.326 --> 28:07.230
I think I can get him probably through

28:08.037 --> 28:10.101
Warner, isn't he still with Warner Books?

28:10.382 --> 28:11.384
He's Scribner.

28:11.404 --> 28:12.927
Scribner, that's okay, good, I know.

28:12.947 --> 28:17.215
But if you need some help in trying to get him, just let me know, because I know John well.

28:17.916 --> 28:18.838
I'd like to talk to him.

28:18.858 --> 28:20.000
I'm sure he knows my book.

28:21.243 --> 28:23.988
Yeah, your book's going to be reviewed.

28:25.211 --> 28:27.235
I do book reviews for NPR.

28:27.796 --> 28:28.156
Really?

28:28.277 --> 28:29.539
Yeah.

28:30.093 --> 28:32.759
That book is the second, say, the next.

28:32.899 --> 28:33.681
I've got one book.

28:33.701 --> 28:34.323
You're kidding me.

28:35.345 --> 28:35.445
Yeah.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.287
I'm going to do it.

28:36.307 --> 28:37.149
I do it myself.

28:37.229 --> 28:38.011
I pick the books.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.777
So it's going to be not this book.

28:40.817 --> 28:42.381
I do one on the 21st.

28:43.804 --> 28:45.789
Well, aren't you sweet?

28:45.829 --> 28:47.292
The 21st, I'm doing something.

28:48.166 --> 28:51.050
a book about, believe it or not, about horses and stuff.

28:51.070 --> 28:51.952
Oh, that sounds good.

28:52.292 --> 29:04.271
Then the next one, then the next turnaround is, I think, the 8th of, what's the next one, of May, because, see, I got, I should have done my, my program on the 8th of this one.

29:04.631 --> 29:05.012
Uh-huh.

29:05.052 --> 29:08.277
So then the 8th of May, that's, that's the book I'm doing.

29:08.397 --> 29:08.958
Good.

29:09.058 --> 29:10.140
And I haven't even read it.

29:10.525 --> 29:12.547
You'll enjoy it.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.390
I've only seen it, you know, when we looked at the book.

29:15.490 --> 29:16.151
You got a copy?

29:16.631 --> 29:17.773
Oh, yeah, I've got a copy.

29:17.913 --> 29:20.596
Because I'd make sure I had my publishers.

29:21.056 --> 29:25.301
Give me your address so I can send you a copy of this piece, and I'll let you know what papers it runs into.

29:26.141 --> 29:26.982
Okay.

29:27.002 --> 29:27.823
It's 180.

29:27.843 --> 29:28.664
180.

29:29.405 --> 29:31.447
Yeah, Adams.

29:31.627 --> 29:32.588
A-D-A-M-S.

29:32.929 --> 29:33.069
Uh-huh.

29:33.569 --> 29:34.570
Suite 250.

29:35.331 --> 29:37.133
Suite 250?

29:37.253 --> 29:37.473
Yeah.

29:37.794 --> 29:38.174
Denver?

29:38.855 --> 29:39.115
Yeah.

29:39.787 --> 29:40.027
80206.

29:40.047 --> 29:44.074
80206.

29:44.435 --> 29:47.820
You know what, Nick, though?

29:48.501 --> 29:49.583
I want a book that's signed.

29:50.324 --> 29:52.548
I've got a book, but I don't have a book that's signed.

29:52.588 --> 29:54.071
Well, why don't I send you a book that's signed?

29:55.072 --> 29:55.453
Of course.

29:57.176 --> 30:02.625
But what I'll probably put in the package is this book that you signed and sent back to me.

30:03.707 --> 30:04.508
Okay.

30:04.528 --> 30:04.829
All right.

30:04.909 --> 30:06.351
And then do they have the...

30:07.073 --> 30:10.579
Do they still have a press kit and all that junk with it or not?

30:10.599 --> 30:11.541
I'll get you one.

30:12.022 --> 30:18.393
Because our stuff is done, and it's three minutes, and it's good.

30:19.194 --> 30:22.560
Well, there were some wonderful reviews of my book.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.747
Michael Derter of the Washington Post, their Pulitzer Prize winning.

30:26.948 --> 30:29.392
He gave it the best review, a full-page review.

30:30.314 --> 30:32.237
The Times gave it a full-page review.

30:32.808 --> 30:34.417
It's had great reviews.

30:34.659 --> 30:38.903
I mean, I was on Brian Lamb's show, which, Christ, I don't need to tape record this.
