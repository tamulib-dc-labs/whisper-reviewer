WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:32.164
It was a huge American.

00:32.600 --> 00:59.738
and when Harper then sold, I think Ranschbrook took over, I don't know how to detail it there, but Ranschbrook had what was well known in the same spell like in the charm of the perverted charm of the very

01:00.815 --> 01:07.864
and it was very well.

01:07.884 --> 01:13.472
So that was not good.

01:13.492 --> 01:21.543
I mentioned Reisner who has published, in the time it's a little periodical, already in Vienna and in the world it's true.

01:21.563 --> 01:23.245
It's about books, not so, not about the experience, it's about books.

01:23.265 --> 01:26.890
It's just what you want to know more about things you should talk to,

01:31.223 --> 01:50.365
So tell me a little bit about your husband's experience.

01:50.765 --> 01:53.489
Well, I will tell you.

01:53.549 --> 01:58.294
He was born in a book of mine.

01:58.966 --> 02:20.240
1909, went for eight years to the Orthodox Jewish program.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.362
And that went for years to the Orthodox Jewish program.

02:22.000 --> 02:42.883
because he had always wanted to become an entrepreneur.

02:42.903 --> 02:46.907
He had an uncle who was a lawyer, lived life with a lawyer, always indirectly.

02:46.928 --> 02:47.989
And late in life he became an entrepreneur.

02:48.009 --> 02:51.012
The only father of his mother, he was very close, not only because of the books, but they had a son at exactly the same age as my husband.

02:51.363 --> 03:08.662
He was also called A.M.

03:08.682 --> 03:12.767
He was also called A.M.

03:12.787 --> 03:13.147
He was called A.M.

03:13.167 --> 03:13.528
He was called A.M.

03:13.548 --> 03:13.908
He was called A.M.

03:13.928 --> 03:14.288
He was called A.M.

03:14.308 --> 03:14.669
He was called A.M.

03:14.689 --> 03:16.611
He was called A.M.

03:18.532 --> 03:25.844
He was an Amsterdam.

03:25.864 --> 03:26.606
He had a business in Amsterdam.

03:27.247 --> 03:31.133
It was somewhat different from him, but it was open.

03:31.153 --> 03:34.759
So did you name him set up in Frankfurt or something?

03:34.779 --> 03:34.839
No.

03:34.859 --> 03:41.130
Now that when he entered, he said that he went to a bank for four years.

03:41.150 --> 03:42.112
It was called his father.

03:42.552 --> 03:43.594
He had read stuff.

03:44.249 --> 03:53.079
commercial experience.

03:53.099 --> 04:07.196
So, he worked in the bank for a year, then life is well announced.

04:07.216 --> 04:09.479
Then he went for about a year to time, and he worked as a volunteer at the .

04:09.499 --> 04:11.901
I mean, I think that's what he might have done with long success.

04:11.921 --> 04:12.442
I worked with Mr. Mollier.

04:12.462 --> 04:12.762
How is Mollier?

04:12.782 --> 04:13.023
M-O-L-I-T-R.

04:13.043 --> 04:13.243
M-O-I-T-R.

04:13.595 --> 04:17.879
M-O-M-I-T-R.

04:18.179 --> 04:31.230
And, you know, they told about this and that he tried to get a job.

04:31.250 --> 04:35.934
And someone said, why don't you try to get a job?

04:35.954 --> 04:36.635
I don't know.

04:36.655 --> 04:38.276
So he went to this and said, he would like to put up this thing.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.338
Well, no, it's not a job.

04:40.418 --> 04:41.059
It's not a job.

04:41.539 --> 04:42.039
It's not a job, you know.

04:42.060 --> 04:42.360
It's a problem.

04:42.380 --> 04:42.640
With about...

04:44.037 --> 05:04.958
That must be that he got married and he got married before, I would say, the end of the 20s.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.602
He's 68, he's 70, he's 68.

05:08.622 --> 05:10.204
Ah, and Mr. Monde, is that more true here?

05:10.224 --> 05:11.445
Where do you want to start?

05:13.433 --> 05:39.142
and he likes to be very French and always, he didn't have watch, but he always went out for the next door, and he had a big watch out, and he said, you're not sure, you're not sure, you're not sure, you're not sure.

05:39.162 --> 05:43.407
This is the way he worked in the bank, and I'm going to say,

05:43.606 --> 05:44.868
Already 12?

05:44.968 --> 05:47.171
Already 12?

05:47.191 --> 06:09.024
Because then I went to do that and again volunteered for a while.

06:09.044 --> 06:09.966
And then he had the first job in the religion.

06:09.986 --> 06:10.186
G-R-A-U-P.

06:10.206 --> 06:10.406
G-R-A-U-P.

06:10.426 --> 06:11.588
One of the expressions of... How of God.

06:12.513 --> 06:17.377
And that was a very big auction house.

06:17.397 --> 06:26.585
I think it could almost be compared to the auction house.

06:27.586 --> 06:34.212
I mean, it was a real big auction house.

06:34.232 --> 06:34.432
Maybe not.

06:34.452 --> 06:35.253
But they had art, and they had books.

06:36.194 --> 06:40.377
And they got great collections, which he cut off.

06:40.397 --> 06:41.338
That was a good auction house.

06:44.525 --> 06:49.113
before the college.

06:49.975 --> 06:55.004
Had he been developing a specialty at all since 2000?

06:58.330 --> 06:58.470
No.

06:58.490 --> 07:01.997
He was preparing and specialized technology.

07:02.017 --> 07:04.862
Then he went to New York to

07:09.668 --> 07:34.515
Anyway, he worked there for a number of his big firms in UNESCO.

07:34.535 --> 07:38.680
Well, I went there to UNESCO study

07:39.470 --> 07:59.558
I knew your father and he was very kind of a machine owner.

08:00.119 --> 08:04.384
I knew your family.

08:04.404 --> 08:04.785
I knew your family.

08:04.805 --> 08:05.186
I knew your family.

08:05.206 --> 08:05.586
I knew your family.

08:05.606 --> 08:05.987
I knew your family.

08:06.007 --> 08:06.768
I knew your family.

08:06.788 --> 08:07.449
I knew your family.

08:07.469 --> 08:08.430
I knew your family.

08:08.680 --> 08:12.967
went to a different synagogue.

08:13.188 --> 08:24.807
Then HALLE was the correct name, H-A-L-L-E, HALLE in the UK.

08:25.328 --> 08:29.214
And they haven't called it much in our country, but this is my problem with it.

08:29.234 --> 08:29.575
And this is...

08:29.993 --> 08:32.336
It was an old film.

08:32.356 --> 08:33.938
Mr. Haller had died.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.060
Mrs. Haller had taken over.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.624
And Mrs. Haller was not an experienced woman.

08:39.644 --> 08:44.510
But she had a man by the name of Schulze Schrauf.

08:44.530 --> 08:46.793
You might or might not.

08:46.813 --> 08:51.879
He was a very German man.

08:51.899 --> 08:58.327
And he would have had an enormous amount of children on Schulze Schrauf.

08:58.347 --> 08:58.667
Schulze Schrauf

08:59.542 --> 09:02.025
anti-semitism.

09:02.086 --> 09:04.128
He wasn't a Nazi.

09:04.950 --> 09:07.693
He wasn't a Nazi.

09:10.017 --> 09:10.217
Very good.

09:10.237 --> 09:13.742
But that anti-semitism is just a shirt of business of the Nazis.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.243
He doesn't see that.

09:14.363 --> 09:14.723
Mr. Schulz.

09:14.743 --> 09:17.267
But anybody hired you, too.

09:17.287 --> 09:20.732
But it was his father.

09:20.752 --> 09:21.993
No, no, no.

09:22.654 --> 09:24.557
It was his father.

09:24.577 --> 09:27.000
Did I hire you those?

09:27.121 --> 09:28.683
Schulzstraten?

09:28.703 --> 09:28.823
F.C.H.

09:29.545 --> 09:52.684
U-L-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-T-S-T-R-A-

09:53.542 --> 10:00.472
This is where Nazism was born, and this is when the Nazis come to power.

10:00.492 --> 10:08.103
Right, exactly, and he was early now.

10:08.123 --> 10:23.245
Except when Hitler became Chancellor, Mrs. Halle was born out, Mr. Schulz took over the term.

10:24.085 --> 10:27.589
And he went home.

10:27.729 --> 10:29.771
I don't know if he was very specific.

10:29.791 --> 10:32.434
If I have that, I really don't know, and I don't want to tell you a lie.

10:33.035 --> 10:34.036
But he went home.

10:34.056 --> 10:38.420
I mean, he was quite clear that he wasn't angry.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.643
Then he talked, however.

10:40.663 --> 10:44.807
He liked to become an excellent teacher.

10:44.827 --> 10:46.749
He did not like that he was a Nazi.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.452
But talked to him and said,

10:49.769 --> 11:00.940
I will start kind of in the book business, being talking about France, and would like to buy a block of books.

11:01.160 --> 11:09.469
And at the end, Mr. Schulz's chart house, at that time, said, I'm not interested in either science or medicine.

11:09.489 --> 11:18.898
If you want to buy a block of books, and these books were bought over 50 years, you know, and stood there with a spark,

11:19.250 --> 11:26.297
This was the start, which was... And Mrs. Haller didn't know anything about it.

11:26.317 --> 11:32.083
And she already had come to Switzerland, and Emil bought the book from Mr. Schulz's grasshouse.

11:32.223 --> 11:39.230
Emil always tells the way Mr. Schulz's grasshouse greeted Mrs. Haller.

11:39.250 --> 11:44.355
There came a customer in, and Mrs. Haller was ancient to sell as much as possible.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.198
A good Jewish woman who wanted to do business,

11:47.313 --> 11:49.095
Why did she hire Schultes?

11:49.495 --> 11:52.879
She did hire Schultes.

11:52.899 --> 11:54.320
He was long there.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.203
So he probably worked with the husband.

11:57.223 --> 11:59.045
Oh, yes, for many years.

11:59.626 --> 12:09.736
And the husband, he was a good man he was.

12:09.756 --> 12:12.959
But Mrs. Hallerich Noah, he told me, he could not tell him what it was.

12:12.979 --> 12:16.543
And he would always say, she's a native of how they were there.

12:16.760 --> 12:34.475
or the Germans, if someone comes in and asks you for toilet paper, you cannot offer him steel room.

12:34.495 --> 12:35.798
That gives you the relationship.

12:37.313 --> 12:40.117
So, your husband brought the mask?

12:40.197 --> 12:44.743
So, my husband said, I would like to open the book here.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.989
And I told him that if you are ready, let me know.

12:49.009 --> 12:55.277
I would get you a lot of silence and meditation.

12:55.297 --> 12:57.160
That's what you would expect.

12:57.260 --> 12:59.683
And was your husband interested in that material?

12:59.703 --> 13:00.805
He had no idea.

13:01.085 --> 13:03.388
He was more interested in that material.

13:04.027 --> 13:22.751
But it was books, and you see the books are already unlocked, they are complete, because I'm sure you have heard that a book seamless, lack of fortune, this fortune, is an incomplete book.

13:22.771 --> 13:32.464
You know, you have a wonderful book, and it looks complete, but when you go home and collate it, you know the expression collate it, and collate it, you see there is

13:33.001 --> 13:39.932
I mean, it's not a page because you can count the pages.

13:41.014 --> 14:00.325
When English started, and I was studying in school, because I was original when I was in Munich, I studied law, and I was thrown out of the law school, before Emil was thrown out of the firm.

14:00.558 --> 14:01.761
Because I'm Jewish, yes.

14:01.982 --> 14:12.728
And it was meant that it was spelled out that the university does not want any Jewish student to have any university.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.885
You know, I've interviewed Otto Bettman for this book.

14:16.905 --> 14:17.405
Do you know Otto?

14:17.826 --> 14:18.207
Yeah, I know.

14:18.447 --> 14:19.148
I know of him.

14:19.168 --> 14:19.869
I don't know him.

14:19.889 --> 14:21.211
He went to Florida last year.

14:21.231 --> 14:24.095
Yeah, he was a Bettman.

14:24.536 --> 14:33.389
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.550 --> 14:36.694
I have never met him, but Emilio told him.

14:36.714 --> 14:40.340
Yeah, yeah.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.922
Emilio told him.

14:42.290 --> 14:48.479
Anyway, you know, the collating of the book was compared with the one because I have page numbers.

14:49.060 --> 14:56.271
And I remember the start of Claude Hedge, I was going back to school here.

14:56.291 --> 15:05.445
And I didn't want law, I knew I could do school back here.

15:05.466 --> 15:06.427
So I went and spoke with them.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.791
I went and spoke with them.

15:08.811 --> 15:11.014
You're jumping ahead of the story.

15:11.315 --> 15:13.258
Yeah, only a little bit.

15:13.418 --> 15:21.909
Because I said to Emil, my oldest son, he was six.

15:22.570 --> 15:27.876
The children were born in France.

15:27.977 --> 15:30.700
Emil gave me a book, a thick book to collate.

15:33.223 --> 15:39.972
And Claude said, I'll do that for you now, Dad, but I won't do that always.

15:40.441 --> 15:43.084
Anyway, we are still in Germany.

15:43.345 --> 15:45.447
So this is the one back in 1934 now?

15:46.108 --> 15:46.509
In 1933 now.

15:46.589 --> 15:48.792
Are you aware that you said in 1934?

15:48.812 --> 15:51.175
In 1934, yeah, but this is still 1933.

15:51.195 --> 15:52.897
And he goes home.

15:54.419 --> 15:55.600
I go in 1933.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.625
I offer a job in Paris.

15:59.645 --> 16:01.948
It's Paris.

16:02.269 --> 16:04.371
Now, are you dating at this point?

16:04.491 --> 16:06.935
Yeah, I already went to Munich over there.

16:07.215 --> 16:08.056
Yeah, yeah.

16:08.797 --> 16:09.638
And lived in Africa.

16:10.782 --> 16:20.456
to take a student's home because my mother was letting him live in a furnished room with my friends.

16:20.596 --> 16:22.519
It was different times.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.463
Anyway, stop me when you say that.

16:26.504 --> 16:32.974
So this parent immigrated to Holla.

16:32.994 --> 16:35.497
And he came to class.

16:35.517 --> 16:39.163
Were they fearful of what was happening?

16:39.183 --> 16:39.523
Yes, yes.

16:39.706 --> 16:48.997
While my father-in-law was born and spoke, I think every European language through it.

16:49.117 --> 16:59.348
My mother-in-law was very fine, so she said, this is not a great issue.

16:59.509 --> 17:04.895
Wendy, of course, the question, where he can go, and when he will take us, anything can go.

17:04.915 --> 17:08.599
So they emigrate, I couldn't tell you exactly what it was, but it must have been, they say, I,

17:08.832 --> 17:13.259
Yeah, I was already.

17:13.739 --> 17:29.763
I had gone to Paris, had gotten a job, you know, once a child.

17:30.685 --> 17:31.706
Not back, no.

17:31.947 --> 17:32.247
Children.

17:33.008 --> 17:33.349
Camps.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.173
And they took literally these children.

17:36.355 --> 17:41.139
I was born in Germany.

17:41.159 --> 17:47.585
I was born in Germany.

17:47.785 --> 17:54.251
I was born in Germany.

17:54.311 --> 18:06.362
I was born in Germany.

18:07.507 --> 18:09.749
But it's fine, actually.

18:09.809 --> 18:10.830
Then it worked out.

18:11.331 --> 18:15.555
And I was there from May to September.

18:15.575 --> 18:19.679
It was like a children's camp, you know.

18:19.719 --> 18:21.742
This is 33.

18:21.762 --> 18:27.187
In 33, in September, the camp closed.

18:27.868 --> 18:30.070
My mother holds me.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.331
I'm an only child.

18:31.351 --> 18:36.697
My mother holds me, if you are so happy there, maybe you want to stay.

18:36.817 --> 18:36.957
I knew.

18:37.443 --> 18:38.485
It was cold.

18:38.505 --> 18:39.266
That was cold.

18:40.127 --> 18:40.287
Right.

18:40.748 --> 18:42.230
And I knew it was hard.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.573
And I knew it was hard.

18:44.593 --> 18:46.937
Because if I said I was an only child.

18:46.957 --> 18:48.319
And so.

18:48.339 --> 18:50.963
What was your maiden name by the way up?

18:51.283 --> 18:56.430
A-R-A-P-P.

18:56.491 --> 18:58.473
That's an easy name.

18:58.493 --> 19:00.476
That's an easy one.

19:00.496 --> 19:00.997
Anyway, go to your home.

19:01.017 --> 19:02.339
So here I was in France.

19:02.459 --> 19:04.903
My mother said, don't come back.

19:04.923 --> 19:06.505
And I have no way to live there.

19:07.193 --> 19:18.829
So when I took these kids back, some of the kids that were come from Russia, I had to bring them to the Jewish agency because they had arranged that they would come into their camp.

19:19.630 --> 19:27.140
While I was bringing back some kids, there was a woman sitting there that said, don't you look for a job?

19:27.160 --> 19:28.882
I said, yes.

19:28.902 --> 19:35.671
And she said, well, I have two children and I need some help.

19:35.691 --> 19:36.272
So I came into my family.

19:37.754 --> 20:03.717
and it was not called a cloud, it was no pair or something.

20:03.737 --> 20:04.298
You couldn't pair the cloud.

20:04.318 --> 20:05.198
So I was there, and that indicated too much.

20:05.219 --> 20:05.879
And all decided to open a vision.

20:05.899 --> 20:06.900
And his father said, I can give you so much money.

20:07.218 --> 20:15.087
I have so much money, I want books for so much money.

20:16.609 --> 20:22.636
And he trusted Shulder Stratans completely.

20:23.016 --> 20:29.344
But he trusted Shulder Stratans completely, as I said, the head already talked about.

20:30.144 --> 20:32.948
And he never felt that he was cheap.

20:32.968 --> 20:34.069
He always felt that he was cheap.

20:34.353 --> 20:39.559
This was a good way for him to come.

20:39.579 --> 20:56.240
So he suddenly was a dealer in old and rare books, in the emphasis on science and ethics.

20:56.260 --> 21:01.626
The office at the PAS,

21:01.960 --> 21:14.594
U-U-I-D-R, which is very clear.

21:20.401 --> 21:25.226
The office I would, I don't example, was this thing is from the window to this chair.

21:25.246 --> 21:30.212
And he had left his chair and had built a few bookcases and the time-rider was under the bed because there was no more

21:31.272 --> 21:36.158
And that's what they said.

21:37.399 --> 21:51.516
What did he call the store?

21:51.537 --> 21:53.759
Older mailbox.

21:53.779 --> 21:53.899
Right.

21:53.919 --> 21:55.601
I didn't pull out, but I'm sure this was very good.

21:55.621 --> 21:59.326
The catalog, which some were, some were sent in the German bookseek, or French bookseek, I don't know, but it was auctioned out in the hotel.

21:59.346 --> 21:59.406
No.

22:00.398 --> 22:03.823
that you might be interested in.

22:03.843 --> 22:06.708
Catalog, as I said, was very kind, yeah.

22:06.728 --> 22:10.573
So, that was his first catalog.

22:10.593 --> 22:13.718
So, all this was in 33.

22:14.379 --> 22:14.740
Yeah.

22:15.160 --> 22:20.508
And so we started there.

22:21.610 --> 22:27.038
By 34, we got married, and moved to Vincent.

22:27.098 --> 22:29.562
Vincent is, do you know Paris at all?

22:30.250 --> 22:38.621
Well, then, it's like you can go here by subway to Riverdale.

22:38.641 --> 22:39.081
It was a subway.

22:39.101 --> 22:40.083
It was a subway.

22:40.103 --> 22:41.224
It was a subway.

22:41.244 --> 22:47.632
You could go here, I see, by subway.

22:47.652 --> 22:48.053
By train.

22:48.073 --> 22:50.316
Oh, it was a subway.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.639
It was by subway.

22:52.659 --> 22:52.759
Yeah.

22:52.779 --> 22:56.123
And we moved in there.

22:56.143 --> 22:59.808
And we moved apart.

22:59.828 --> 23:00.088
And...

23:00.997 --> 23:09.768
Claude was born in 36 years.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.170
And it was very small.

23:11.190 --> 23:23.386
And one day he came home and said, today I had to borrow a few forms from the doorman or something, because I really had no money.

23:23.406 --> 23:26.530
And then there was a very lucky strike.

23:26.570 --> 23:30.295
There was Mag, which is one of the big English girls,

23:30.393 --> 23:46.295
And there was a man by the man of Juvim.

23:46.315 --> 23:48.738
Juvim, the sixth.

23:49.279 --> 23:50.901
He's that same name.

23:50.921 --> 23:53.525
He's not the famous man.

23:53.545 --> 23:58.432
He was a chemist and was sick in Paris.

23:58.452 --> 24:00.214
And someone gave a book, an old

24:00.532 --> 24:21.564
And he got into two old strangers and went to Max and said, who did you put in the dress?

24:21.585 --> 24:27.193
And Mr. Ebbinghausen, who was a place to the place, but I see it there, all the stories about Mr. Ebbinghausen.

24:27.213 --> 24:27.794
But I was somewhere else.

24:27.814 --> 24:28.395
Mr. Ebbinghausen said, yes.

24:29.337 --> 24:40.250
But you have to look for some kind of, they are not just lying around.

24:40.290 --> 24:48.380
You can look at the book dealers, but you cannot look at that.

24:48.400 --> 24:55.749
However, there is a young refugee who just as old and in this field, why don't you know it?

24:55.769 --> 24:58.012
Engage the app.

24:58.032 --> 24:58.112
Wow.

24:58.700 --> 25:14.603
and Mr. D, you can name it.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.037
If it's too beautiful, it's too beautiful, then it's too beautiful.

25:24.057 --> 25:25.559
To be in comparative with Mr. D, Mr. D, thank you, and thank you very much.

25:25.579 --> 25:26.040
What is it, what is it?

25:37.698 --> 25:47.290
And after that, he lived.

25:48.692 --> 25:54.840
And what did he do for a living?

25:54.860 --> 25:56.402
He was a kid.

25:56.422 --> 25:57.764
He was a kid.

25:57.784 --> 26:00.608
Was he a collector or was this for a kid?

26:00.628 --> 26:01.429
No, no.

26:01.449 --> 26:04.272
He became a collector.

26:05.274 --> 26:06.355
He was just intrigued.

26:06.588 --> 26:15.497
that might have belonged to me.

26:15.617 --> 26:20.042
But this was just starting for me.

26:21.364 --> 26:24.767
That was also your first major customer.

26:24.787 --> 26:25.348
Our first major customer.

26:25.368 --> 26:27.029
And this was probably 34.

26:27.049 --> 26:30.613
I don't know if he was already married or if he stayed after.

26:30.633 --> 26:33.096
Anyway, I had some problems.

26:34.818 --> 26:36.139
I was supposed to be in the country.

26:36.828 --> 26:56.717
Well, anyway, he got married, named Akshay, but married with a Mary of the Motherland, in the Mary of the Motherland, very elegant, there, and it was very nice, and we had luck in our country, you know, a little bit, you know, and that was a great course.

26:57.318 --> 27:05.350
And so, by and by, his father, and he got other customers, he always had to

27:06.005 --> 27:25.194
In 1939 we went out to Jason, started to go on and there was a nice spa, I had to go another spa and went there, in Auburn.

27:25.274 --> 27:25.975
Where did you go?

27:26.055 --> 27:27.417
A year started to go on.

27:28.719 --> 27:34.628
It was, you can say,

27:34.912 --> 27:38.617
I was pregnant.

27:38.877 --> 28:00.623
Because we thought, when the Germans moved into Czar, no war was started, that war would probably not be another war, but if you had another child.

28:00.644 --> 28:02.265
So that was 39, and probably 39, that war was alive.

28:02.286 --> 28:04.328
Then Emil was returned for a short while,

28:04.983 --> 28:22.003
but was released because he had a pension child.

28:25.628 --> 28:26.529
He was in turn for about three or four years.

28:26.549 --> 28:32.296
So how do you say the story already attached to it because he wanted to enlist him in a job and went to La Roche, which was the nearest bigger town, and then went there to enlist for the first day of the organization.

28:32.316 --> 28:33.097
But he was sure that he couldn't do it.

28:33.117 --> 28:33.437
He was close.

28:34.126 --> 28:43.601
So he had to stay overnight, meet his German passport, so they say the German, and then they came and he thirsted.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.304
So it was every three weeks.

28:45.324 --> 28:53.016
Then he came back home, and then we were accused of giving signs to the Germans.

28:53.036 --> 28:53.236
Right.

28:53.256 --> 28:57.603
Yeah, signs to the German airplanes.

28:57.623 --> 28:58.665
Oh, excuse me, it hurts.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.986
There was so much confusion.

29:06.006 --> 29:20.127
So we were taught, we were not interested in other relations, but we were only taught it couldn't stay at the beach show.

29:20.448 --> 29:22.651
It had to go.

29:23.212 --> 29:25.655
This is over by Boulogne now, right?

29:25.716 --> 29:27.638
No, by Sable de Boulogne.

29:27.919 --> 29:30.002
Not Boulogne.

29:30.910 --> 29:34.894
It was in Jaure-sur-Mer, and Sable d'Olonne is a bigger town there.

29:36.936 --> 29:38.378
In the Mont-des-E, right?

29:38.398 --> 29:40.780
Mont-des-E, that's easier now.

29:41.881 --> 29:45.064
How do you spell?

29:45.084 --> 29:45.445
V-E-N-E-E-E.

29:45.845 --> 29:59.379
And so we went to the nearest indoor, you know, what do they call it?

29:59.399 --> 30:00.580
Cartier, I think.

30:02.585 --> 30:13.622
a different name that comes back again, which was called Les Deux Serres, and New York Deux Serres, so we lived in New York.

30:13.642 --> 30:15.125
So you've left Paris now.

30:15.145 --> 30:17.288
We have left Paris for vacation.

30:17.308 --> 30:18.229
So this is in the summer.

30:18.249 --> 30:19.151
He never went back.

30:19.712 --> 30:22.837
He left everything in our apartment.

30:22.997 --> 30:28.305
I actually had moved from Vincennes to Saint-Mondé, but he never went back to his office.

30:28.943 --> 30:31.667
We never went back to our apartment.

30:31.687 --> 30:34.630
All was left there.

30:34.691 --> 30:39.517
Emil went back just to get some diapers and some clothes for the baby.

30:39.537 --> 30:42.901
Well, because of the fact that the war had started?

30:42.921 --> 30:45.104
Because of the fact that the war had started.

30:45.565 --> 30:50.992
And he traveled on a German passport, which was not very desirable.

30:51.012 --> 30:58.782
I mean, he wasn't normally asked, but if he was asked, his one big identity was a passport.

30:59.639 --> 31:01.501
So we moved to New York.

31:03.203 --> 31:07.188
See, you could make a story of everything to think.

31:07.288 --> 31:08.449
Lived in New York.

31:09.751 --> 31:21.785
Their province was poor.

31:23.487 --> 31:28.853
And about a week, or two weeks,

31:29.035 --> 31:36.882
After she was born, the policeman came and said to Emil, he had to be interned.

31:37.523 --> 31:39.224
Again, he'd already been interned once.

31:39.484 --> 31:41.846
Once he was interned, and that is the second time.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.368
But they didn't intern him.

31:43.908 --> 31:48.572
They told him to go to a camp where he would be interned.

31:48.692 --> 31:51.135
He had to travel to half a camp.

31:51.155 --> 31:52.556
And they told him on his own.

31:52.876 --> 31:53.256
On his own.

31:53.277 --> 31:55.959
So maybe they were saying, get out of France, is probably what they were saying.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.220
Maybe.

31:57.638 --> 31:59.861
But by that time, he had a family.

32:00.882 --> 32:03.746
And he went to the camp, the Rüscher.

32:03.847 --> 32:04.788
Did he go to the camp?

32:04.868 --> 32:05.188
Yes.

32:05.909 --> 32:06.911
What else could he do?

32:08.112 --> 32:11.016
You know, you couldn't just go out of France.

32:11.237 --> 32:13.540
I mean, with a German passport.

32:13.920 --> 32:18.306
So many people tried to go over Switzerland, to Spain.

32:18.326 --> 32:19.788
It was a dangerous thing.

32:20.089 --> 32:23.754
So he went to the camp, which was called Camp Rüscher.

32:24.495 --> 32:26.818
And there were many, many Germans

32:27.102 --> 32:31.388
anti-Hitler people, well-known anti-Hitler people.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.469
Not necessarily Jews.

32:32.950 --> 32:38.918
No, no, not necessarily Jews, but people who had written books against Hitler.

32:38.938 --> 32:41.382
They were all... What was the name of the king?

32:41.402 --> 32:44.306
Ruchard, R-U-C-H-A-R-D.

32:44.326 --> 32:47.490
Okay, there's probably something written about it too.

32:47.510 --> 32:51.956
Probably you find something about Ruchard, Kent Ruchard.

32:51.976 --> 32:55.962
And there were many well-known people.

32:56.347 --> 33:03.076
I don't know what he writes in his... Oh, does he have his piece there?

33:03.096 --> 33:04.418
I took it out there, yeah.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.240
Are you going to let me borrow that and copy it?

33:06.781 --> 33:08.223
No, I do not.

33:08.303 --> 33:12.128
I told you there was some... You can read it.

33:12.229 --> 33:12.529
May I?

33:12.549 --> 33:12.649
Okay.

33:12.669 --> 33:14.532
Yeah, but you cannot copy it.

33:14.652 --> 33:17.616
And I told you there was some discussion about this, yeah.

33:17.656 --> 33:17.916
I understand.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.720
But you have it out, that's why I know it.

33:20.740 --> 33:22.843
Yeah, I have it, yeah.

33:23.380 --> 33:26.785
I'm really interested in his experiences, of course, as the bookseller, too.

33:27.046 --> 33:27.686
Right, yeah.

33:27.707 --> 33:31.793
Well, that's... Let me see.

33:32.053 --> 33:32.794
French ceremony.

33:33.255 --> 33:34.877
This is all long before that.

33:37.762 --> 33:44.251
Fender's being reunited, he had to find a place to live in, and that's also still earlier.

33:47.256 --> 33:52.003
Here he is about...

33:53.215 --> 33:57.144
No, this is the first time when he was interned.

33:58.848 --> 34:00.974
Anyway, maybe we can look at that a bit later.

34:01.274 --> 34:04.442
It's the first time that he was interned, but I want to show you.

34:04.923 --> 34:06.667
I wondered if there were names.

34:06.827 --> 34:07.890
Camp Ruchard.

34:08.411 --> 34:11.258
So I found myself traveling north to the camp,

34:11.609 --> 34:15.893
R-U-C-H, just the way you spelled it, right?

34:15.993 --> 34:23.381
Yeah, I-U-C-H, near Azay-le-Rideau, that is the town that's near the town, the place.

34:24.302 --> 34:40.418
A-Z-A-Y hyphen, L-E hyphen, Rideau, R-I-D-E-A-U, on the Loire River.

34:40.786 --> 34:41.647
I read you this.

34:41.847 --> 34:52.240
During the approximately four weeks I spent at Rucha, I met some old friends and made the acquaintances of some interesting people.

34:52.941 --> 35:02.372
Among the inmates were some members of the intellectual elite of German refugees who hitherto had escaped internment.

35:02.825 --> 35:12.516
Now, however, they were indiscriminately taken in, notwithstanding the fact that they were Hitler's staunchest adversaries.

35:12.536 --> 35:24.711
Such as, to cite only, that's what I was looking for, to cite only one example, the German political author Konrad Hayden.

35:25.251 --> 35:26.593
You might have heard of him.

35:26.673 --> 35:29.997
H-E-I-D-E-N.

35:30.618 --> 35:36.086
who had written the most devastating biography of the great adults.

35:37.428 --> 35:38.710
Conrad with a K, right?

35:38.830 --> 35:41.994
Yes, Conrad with a K, right.

35:42.435 --> 35:44.097
H-E-I-D-E-N.

35:46.942 --> 35:59.680
The complete unawareness of the French was most vividly demonstrated at the time of the abrupt termination

35:59.947 --> 36:04.132
of our sojourn at Ruchard.

36:04.152 --> 36:22.174
In June, after the Germans had invaded France and an armistice being concluded, the commander of the camp assembled us in the courtyard and made a little speech telling us that in view of the circumstances, he had to let us go because the Germans had been victims.

36:22.762 --> 36:39.345
and that he had only one request, namely that as an old army officer who had served his country for many years, he wished we would show our respect for him by not giving our joy too open expression.

36:40.266 --> 36:46.735
To this, the audience replied by unanimously shouting, Vive la France!

36:47.376 --> 36:48.437
Now, this is a Frenchman?

36:48.457 --> 36:50.340
This is a French camp that they're in?

36:50.981 --> 36:51.942
Yeah, it's a French who...

36:52.192 --> 36:53.814
in turn, the Germans.

36:53.834 --> 36:57.958
But this was an enemy of Hitler who was in prison, too?

36:58.478 --> 36:59.219
Yes.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.261
Why would the French want to imprison?

37:01.281 --> 37:04.244
Well, this, anybody German was in prison.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.446
So, basically, it was anyone German was in prison.

37:06.466 --> 37:07.828
Any German was in prison.

37:07.848 --> 37:07.988
I see.

37:08.028 --> 37:13.994
So, it had nothing to do with political... And many were Jews, of course, but many were not Jews, like this kind of statement.

37:14.154 --> 37:15.456
And that's what he says.

37:15.556 --> 37:17.478
It was the French's count.

37:17.498 --> 37:19.920
So, they scream... So, vive la France.

37:20.272 --> 37:24.438
which left this poor man in utter consternation.

37:24.458 --> 37:35.332
At no point had he realized that his prisoners were in much greater danger of being captured by the Germans than by the French.

37:35.613 --> 37:37.275
May I read that a little bit?

37:37.535 --> 37:42.322
I don't know if anybody corrected it.

37:42.362 --> 37:44.845
Maybe his daughter corrected it, but I don't think so.

37:45.314 --> 37:49.580
So that, I read you this, because this is really of some interest.

37:49.680 --> 37:54.688
As I said, everybody was interned, and then they were released.

37:54.708 --> 37:59.515
Then they were released and were running, because nobody had anywhere to go.

37:59.535 --> 38:04.883
And the Italians had not yet made peace, so they were bombed.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.688
Anyway, he ended up in Limoges.

38:08.708 --> 38:13.195
In the meantime, I was still in Lyon, where Florence was born.

38:14.272 --> 38:23.884
Limoges was occupied, became occupied.

38:24.305 --> 38:26.988
I didn't know where he was.

38:27.008 --> 38:28.610
I had no idea where he was.

38:28.630 --> 38:30.112
He had written to me.

38:30.432 --> 38:32.094
How long was this?

38:33.476 --> 38:34.297
How long was this?

38:34.317 --> 38:36.099
That you didn't know that you were out of time?

38:36.119 --> 38:36.920
For about two months.

38:38.482 --> 38:43.148
He had written one of the last letters he had written to me.

38:43.634 --> 38:45.296
send me all the money you have.

38:45.737 --> 38:46.759
But I had no money.

38:47.940 --> 38:56.212
And I knew that at that time he probably thought of running to Switzerland or Spain or something to do his cake somewhere.

38:57.254 --> 38:58.776
Anyway, I had no money.

38:58.836 --> 38:59.918
I couldn't send any money.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.581
And then I didn't hear from him.

39:02.601 --> 39:12.696
And then two months later came a postcard which said, I have the postcard, I don't know where it is.

39:13.469 --> 39:18.577
I am sick, healthy, injured.

39:19.118 --> 39:21.662
And you could underline it.

39:22.303 --> 39:25.489
And a few more things like this.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.994
I'd like to hear from you with no address or anything.

39:29.014 --> 39:31.779
But a postal stamp, and it came from divorce.

39:33.201 --> 39:36.827
And I knew that it was a divorce.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.523
And then I set out with the children to see none of this myself.

39:41.563 --> 39:43.424
But you really don't want to hear my story.

39:43.444 --> 39:45.386
You want to hear something about old kids.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.849
Well, I want to get you to coming here.

39:49.209 --> 39:49.950
Yeah, all right.

39:49.970 --> 39:53.913
So then I went and looked for him and found him.

39:53.953 --> 39:57.977
It was not easy, I assure you, with two children and not knowing where.

39:58.017 --> 40:04.402
And it was difficult to get from one part of France into the other part.

40:04.422 --> 40:05.543
But we got there.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.725
In the meantime, he had become...

40:08.532 --> 40:15.442
a, well, what would you call it, a work soldier.

40:16.063 --> 40:17.545
He was not a full soldier.

40:17.626 --> 40:19.148
He was not a prisoner.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.350
He was a work soldier.

40:20.390 --> 40:22.473
He worked for the French.

40:22.733 --> 40:24.696
He worked for the French or for the Germans.

40:24.736 --> 40:25.898
I don't even know.

40:25.998 --> 40:27.160
No, he worked for the French.

40:27.961 --> 40:29.603
And there was a whole group there.

40:29.644 --> 40:38.016
And I had gotten near that place by the purest of chance.

40:38.384 --> 41:08.222
because when I went, well, not pure, sometimes, I headed for Limouge, but got stuck before that, and someone took me over the border, and so then I was in Belac, and in Belac, where I, which is, oh, maybe 50 miles from Limouge, not very far, and someone had taken me there and said, why don't you

41:08.438 --> 41:12.124
rest overnight and go tomorrow and look for emotion.

41:12.144 --> 41:19.395
And then he said, and I told him a little bit, this man was the mayor of Bellagenet's car.

41:22.700 --> 41:31.693
Anyway, so he said, and I told him a little bit, I said, if only I could get the kids to America.

41:31.713 --> 41:34.758
In the meantime, my in-laws had gone to America.

41:35.219 --> 41:37.382
My father-in-law... From Germany.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.543
From Holland.

41:38.604 --> 41:39.285
From Holland.

41:39.325 --> 41:51.423
My father-in-law, being born in France, could get a visa immediately as a French, because the American count where you were born, not where you have lived or what you are.

41:51.863 --> 41:53.265
So he was born in Paris.

41:53.606 --> 41:55.829
He could get a visa immediately.

41:55.849 --> 42:00.616
So they had already arrived in America, and I said, if I could only get the kids to America.

42:00.636 --> 42:00.796
To here?

42:00.817 --> 42:01.297
In New York?

42:01.337 --> 42:02.219
Did they come to New York?

42:02.239 --> 42:03.400
To New York, yeah.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.884
If I could only get the kids to America.

42:06.404 --> 42:16.139
And then this man said, you know, the American Red Cross has retreated and is now in Belak.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.564
Maybe you should talk to them first.

42:19.584 --> 42:25.012
So I went in there and talked to somebody in uniform and told my story.

42:26.094 --> 42:30.100
And she said, and I said, is there any transport of children?

42:30.569 --> 42:34.953
because there would be a very definite address and someone who would take care of the truth.

42:34.973 --> 42:36.774
She said, no, we haven't found that yet.

42:36.855 --> 42:39.477
We have many other things to do before we think of that.

42:40.918 --> 42:43.581
But your story sounds very familiar.

42:44.722 --> 42:45.722
And I looked at her.

42:46.964 --> 42:48.365
She said, yes, let me look.

42:49.246 --> 42:52.328
Your name is unusual, so it cannot be as we say.

42:53.129 --> 42:55.871
And she came back and said, is your husband Emil?

42:55.891 --> 42:56.552
And I said, yes.

42:57.693 --> 42:59.935
And she said, he was here two weeks ago.

43:00.708 --> 43:02.090
I said, where is he now?

43:02.110 --> 43:05.995
She said, I didn't keep time off here.

43:06.015 --> 43:11.263
But he said, there is a group of work soldiers up there.

43:11.283 --> 43:12.725
They are all refugees.

43:12.745 --> 43:16.410
He might be there, or someone might know him near Taiwan.

43:16.430 --> 43:18.212
That's fascinating.

43:18.232 --> 43:21.957
So is Claude, my son, who was then four years old.

43:23.279 --> 43:25.783
So I left this method abroad in a crypt.

43:25.843 --> 43:27.525
He said, just leave the baby here.

43:28.417 --> 43:29.338
I went up to .

43:29.458 --> 43:38.567
And I asked many people whom I heard speak in German, do you know them by the name of Offenbacher?

43:38.587 --> 43:41.009
No, no, Offenbacher.

43:41.030 --> 43:50.219
And then I saw a man, and I said, if Amy knows anybody, he could be this man, because he looked very bookish, and he had a book under his arm, and so on.

43:50.239 --> 43:54.723
And so I asked him, he said, yes, we have an Offenbacher, but he isn't called Amy.

43:54.743 --> 43:56.685
And I said, come on.

43:57.290 --> 43:57.991
Common name.

43:58.051 --> 43:58.952
Common name.

43:58.972 --> 44:03.618
But I did say, is he the father of this child?

44:03.638 --> 44:05.981
And he looked at his clothes and said, undoubtedly.

44:08.304 --> 44:09.065
Undoubtedly.

44:09.085 --> 44:09.245
Yeah.

44:09.946 --> 44:11.628
So then I knew he was there.

44:11.689 --> 44:13.191
And I said, where is Emil now?

44:13.211 --> 44:17.496
He said, well, he works, but you go right up to Sansovere and he will appear there.

44:18.117 --> 44:24.445
And I think the real letdown in my whole story is that I was sitting there, flawed,

44:25.977 --> 44:32.944
And Emil comes and says, hi, because he had in the meantime been told, you know, your wife.

44:33.305 --> 44:37.108
He just said, hi, as if I had never been anywhere else.

44:37.709 --> 44:40.932
Well, and then he spent in Belag some time.

44:41.733 --> 44:44.396
And in the meantime, my in-laws tried.

44:44.596 --> 44:51.343
And again, he was not working in Belag because he worked for the government.

44:53.095 --> 45:01.844
In the meantime, my in-laws tried to get visas for us, but it wasn't possible to get a visa for someone German.

45:01.864 --> 45:04.246
And they bought us a visa for Cuba.

45:06.749 --> 45:08.210
But that wasn't always easy.

45:08.230 --> 45:13.075
I mean, the buying of the visa for Cuba, I think, was comparatively easy, if you want to spend the money.

45:13.135 --> 45:14.617
It's getting closer, isn't it?

45:14.637 --> 45:14.797
Yeah.

45:14.897 --> 45:16.839
But how to get out?

45:16.879 --> 45:23.085
You needed to go through Spain, because we couldn't go through France, because that was occupied.

45:23.858 --> 45:27.002
So we had to go into Spain to get... So where are you now?

45:27.082 --> 45:27.783
Are you still in France?

45:27.803 --> 45:29.665
I'm still in Belac in France, yeah.

45:30.486 --> 45:31.467
I'm still in Belac.

45:31.547 --> 45:35.091
But this part is not occupied yet by the Germans?

45:35.131 --> 45:36.152
No, no.

45:36.172 --> 45:38.455
No, that was when I had Emil found it.

45:38.515 --> 45:40.958
Not occupied by the Germans.

45:40.978 --> 45:46.545
And we lived in a house that had no windows, but we lived there.

45:46.565 --> 45:52.552
And then Emil applied for a passport.

45:52.572 --> 45:53.713
He had no passport yet.

45:56.444 --> 45:59.168
He had to go to Vichy.

45:59.788 --> 46:08.379
In Vichy, there were the Scandinavians who took care of Germans because, of course, there was no German.

46:08.780 --> 46:11.403
But anyway, we made it.

46:12.785 --> 46:22.097
Not immediately, but we did make it into Spain and got on a Spanish boat and came to Cuba.

46:22.685 --> 46:25.189
This is 1934?

46:26.070 --> 46:27.433
This is 1941.

46:27.953 --> 46:30.357
You're kidding.

46:30.377 --> 46:32.781
No, I'm not kidding.

46:32.801 --> 46:34.103
This is 1941.

46:34.704 --> 46:36.707
The war started in 1939.

46:37.729 --> 46:39.812
So, it's 1941.

46:43.538 --> 46:47.244
We came to Cuba.

46:48.085 --> 46:49.047
We're interned.

46:50.174 --> 46:52.337
but in a very snotty camp.

46:52.357 --> 46:54.600
It was clean, it was warm.

46:54.700 --> 46:55.582
By the Americans?

46:56.363 --> 46:57.845
No, by the Cubans.

46:57.865 --> 46:59.146
And had everything to eat.

46:59.167 --> 47:02.611
We wanted lots of food, and it was just marvelous.

47:03.472 --> 47:08.700
And then, well, yeah, coming out of France, and we had nothing to eat.

47:09.541 --> 47:16.210
And therefore, a week in Spain, we had for breakfast for the four of us, because Florence is out in town.

47:16.230 --> 47:19.675
But Emil, I, and Claude, who was by that time

47:20.178 --> 47:35.042
four years old, not quite, she was just months younger than four years old, and the three of us eight, we got a role, like for Frankfurt, that was what we got for practice, but we didn't have more.

47:35.062 --> 47:37.105
Spain had nothing to eat.

47:37.125 --> 47:43.435
And we got here, we got to Spain, they interned and felt it was very marvellous, very fine.

47:44.258 --> 47:53.626
And about a week when we were there, one day our name was called, and my in-laws had come on a banana boat on a coastline.

47:54.527 --> 48:10.581
And since the banana boat went on to a few other islands, my in-laws stayed in a hotel, took us out into a very nice and elegant hotel with a great change in life.

48:10.601 --> 48:12.763
And the next day,

48:13.351 --> 48:24.144
My father-in-law and my husband went to the consul, to the American consul, and the consul said, nobody comes out anymore.

48:24.164 --> 48:31.953
If you can prove that your children will not be welfare resistant, I can give them the visa immediately.

48:33.655 --> 48:39.042
So I said, I have to see all four of them, you know, that they are not sick.

48:39.062 --> 48:41.805
And then there are the medical...

48:42.038 --> 48:46.243
Exam, first we had one for Cuba.

48:46.603 --> 48:52.110
I never took my coat off when we had the example of Cuba with all the money.

48:52.610 --> 49:04.164
Anyway, we had bargained for so much talk, you thought you would hear anything about antiquarian book dealers.

49:06.006 --> 49:10.932
We got, we immigrated on the banana boat.

49:12.177 --> 49:16.564
My father-in-law said, do you have room for two grown-ups and two children?

49:17.585 --> 49:20.109
And we immigrated on the banana boat.

49:20.149 --> 49:22.152
So you came to America on a banana boat?

49:22.172 --> 49:24.696
We came to America on a banana boat.

49:24.816 --> 49:29.984
And the immigration officer came only up for us.

49:30.004 --> 49:31.767
Everybody else was there.

49:32.228 --> 49:36.995
You know, there were Americans who went on a cruise.

49:37.416 --> 49:40.260
So he came.

49:42.063 --> 49:50.132
So everything was left behind, whatever stock he had, any books, that was all... Nothing.

49:50.152 --> 50:05.488
What we had consisted of his typewriter put together with a piece of string and a food mill, which I had in a big shopping bag where I prepared food for flowers, who was then just about a year old.

50:06.734 --> 50:11.638
And one suitcase, which was also put together as a piece of string.

50:11.659 --> 50:13.340
I don't know what was it.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.461
You know, whatever we had.

50:15.302 --> 50:22.148
And my father-in-law said, I think you can leave your package here.

50:22.168 --> 50:22.869
Leave it in Cuba.

50:23.609 --> 50:25.451
No, leave it at the boat there.

50:25.471 --> 50:25.912
Oh, I see.

50:25.932 --> 50:26.032
Yeah.

50:26.832 --> 50:28.054
Well, it was all we had.

50:28.134 --> 50:30.196
We did not hear anything like that.

50:30.256 --> 50:33.078
We were very offended when we said that.

50:33.098 --> 50:36.201
He lived on 90...

50:36.400 --> 50:37.601
Ford and Madison.

50:38.803 --> 50:39.183
Wow.

50:40.966 --> 50:42.828
In a three-room apartment.

50:42.868 --> 50:45.051
What was his business?

50:45.411 --> 50:48.575
He was in metal and had always traveled.

50:49.696 --> 50:54.242
The firm, I think at that time, yeah, he still worked for an international firm.

50:54.402 --> 50:56.665
So they were not impoverished by any means?

50:56.685 --> 50:59.368
They were not impoverished, no, by any means.

50:59.549 --> 51:05.496
But by that time, they were old, you know, and it was quite clear that he would not work much longer.

51:06.674 --> 51:15.405
Anyway, they lived in a three-room apartment, albeit a large apartment, on 94th and Madison.

51:15.425 --> 51:21.332
And when the doorman threw our letter, he didn't say anything, but he thought the same thing as my father-in-law.

51:21.352 --> 51:24.556
He should have left that.

51:24.576 --> 51:26.098
So this is now 1941.

51:26.218 --> 51:27.200
You get to New York.

51:27.340 --> 51:29.082
This is now April 1941.

51:30.384 --> 51:33.227
So it's still seven, eight months before America.

51:33.247 --> 51:35.550
Pearl Harbor, unfortunately.

51:36.273 --> 51:49.124
And then, and this is where now comes the antiquarian book dealer, there was Erwin Rosenthal, who was Barney's father, and who had a big firm in Munich.

51:49.445 --> 51:53.008
He also had a firm in Switzerland.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.869
He was a big book dealer.

51:55.550 --> 51:59.814
And he said, I hope to get to America.

52:00.494 --> 52:02.256
I think I'll get my visa.

52:02.276 --> 52:04.558
It wasn't quite clear yet if it went.

52:05.382 --> 52:12.312
And I would like to open a firm again in America.

52:13.053 --> 52:14.955
But I cannot open a big firm.

52:16.778 --> 52:20.423
And I don't want to open a small firm under my name.

52:21.304 --> 52:29.035
But I would like to have you as my employee and use your name for the firm.

52:29.556 --> 52:34.022
His name was not a big name.

52:35.167 --> 52:36.889
So he came and made.

52:37.290 --> 52:41.356
So he basically was going to be Rosenthal's partner, but the business would be in his name?

52:41.456 --> 52:41.976
No, no.

52:42.097 --> 52:43.198
He was not his partner.

52:43.218 --> 52:44.139
He was an employee.

52:44.260 --> 52:45.862
An employee, but he would use his name.

52:45.882 --> 52:47.624
But the business was in his name, yeah.

52:47.644 --> 52:48.185
Well, that's great.

52:48.205 --> 52:49.567
But he was a straight employee.

52:50.708 --> 52:52.010
Well paid, I should say.

52:52.030 --> 52:54.754
But why didn't Rosenthal want to use his own name?

52:54.794 --> 53:00.061
Because the firm of Rosenthal was too big to have a little office here.

53:00.081 --> 53:01.163
So it would have been embarrassing.

53:01.183 --> 53:02.625
It would have been embarrassing.

53:02.665 --> 53:04.988
I mean, it would have put him down, I mean.

53:05.727 --> 53:08.672
So this was one way to do business, and yet I understand.

53:08.732 --> 53:10.054
Right, yeah.

53:10.074 --> 53:11.276
So it was back to me.

53:11.296 --> 53:13.940
And it was Emil Offenbach.

53:13.960 --> 53:15.522
So it was agreeable to everybody.

53:15.643 --> 53:21.011
It was agreeable to everybody, and lasted until the war started.

53:22.033 --> 53:23.575
So just about eight or nine months.

53:23.896 --> 53:26.720
Right, maybe a few more months, yeah.

53:26.740 --> 53:33.591
And then it was for Emil Feint or work, and the work was not an antiquated book dealer.

53:34.330 --> 53:43.182
So he worked in a firm that made airplanes, or parts of airplanes.

53:43.723 --> 53:44.303
In England.

53:44.644 --> 53:50.792
In Manhattan, in a firm that did part of the airplane.

53:50.812 --> 53:54.076
And I think that is the end of his story.

53:55.378 --> 53:59.163
Does he talk at all in here about his work in the book business at all?

53:59.183 --> 54:00.926
Or this is just his personal background?

54:00.946 --> 54:04.270
Not very much, no, because that's not...

54:09.076 --> 54:10.958
That's already in Yaw.

54:12.419 --> 54:13.660
This is Mjönig.

54:13.800 --> 54:20.567
I have a new poster on Ludwigstraße in Mjönig.

54:21.508 --> 54:22.709
The writing was short.

54:22.729 --> 54:24.951
That was when the Nazis came in.

54:25.031 --> 54:26.493
I see.

54:26.533 --> 54:30.857
So did you ever talk about, I mean, was there anxiety about the Nazis?

54:30.877 --> 54:31.517
Did you talk about that?

54:31.537 --> 54:31.918
Oh, yes.

54:32.358 --> 54:32.678
Oh, yes.

54:32.879 --> 54:35.281
By that time... You were certain, of course, that had you stayed.

54:36.022 --> 54:36.482
Oh, yes.

54:36.502 --> 54:38.644
By that time, I mean, it was such...

54:39.097 --> 54:48.868
that I went to Paris without knowing anything, what kind of a job, whom I would meet, not knowing a single person or so.

54:51.110 --> 54:53.012
But it was a saving.

54:53.073 --> 54:56.797
I mean, to come is possible, to be allowed to go out.

54:57.057 --> 55:00.721
So after the war, so then he worked in an airplane parts factory?

55:01.442 --> 55:02.863
He worked in an airplane parts factory.

55:02.883 --> 55:03.744
How long did he work there?

55:06.287 --> 55:07.028
During the war.

55:07.278 --> 55:10.201
So then, up until 1945 or so, right?

55:10.221 --> 55:11.522
Right, right.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.164
And that's what I'm just saying.

55:17.969 --> 55:24.875
The Thunderbolt came on August 23rd when it became known that now this is still the European war.

55:24.935 --> 55:25.936
Yeah.

55:25.956 --> 55:29.260
We were free now, but yeah, but still France.

55:31.542 --> 55:36.627
I'm trying to, in fact, if France comes a little bit of my

55:37.518 --> 55:44.528
I did not have a French passport either.

55:44.568 --> 55:46.831
They're still all to get out.

55:48.273 --> 55:50.617
I happen to recall the name of the business.

55:50.757 --> 55:52.179
That's when we came to Spain.

55:53.360 --> 56:02.774
We had a few pounds, which I think, or a few dollars, which my father-in-law had sent, you know, took the rest or sent the pill.

56:03.495 --> 56:05.778
But in Spain, they didn't take it.

56:05.838 --> 56:07.120
So when did he start?

56:07.522 --> 56:12.671
After the war, he got into the antiquarian book business again after the war?

56:12.771 --> 56:16.898
He started in June 1939 with Erwin Rosenthal.

56:17.379 --> 56:17.900
I understand.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.695
Yeah, and then he started again, and that's what I'm looking for, where it is.

56:28.799 --> 56:32.365
We arrived in New York at the end of March 1941.

56:35.332 --> 56:39.419
The antiquarian book business at that time still suffered from the recession.

56:39.479 --> 56:43.426
That was when he was already with Erwin Rosenthal.

56:43.466 --> 56:45.409
He lived in Brighton Beach then.

56:47.993 --> 56:54.304
My collaboration with Erwin Rosenthal lasted about two years.

56:54.324 --> 56:57.229
Can I just take a look at this?

56:57.249 --> 56:58.491
Yes, yes.

56:58.511 --> 56:59.333
It starts here.

56:59.353 --> 57:00.715
At the end of the war, he says,

57:01.184 --> 57:05.831
On the day the armistice was signed, my services were not needed any longer and I lost my job.

57:06.472 --> 57:16.326
At that time, my self-esteem was at such a low point that I had almost lost the courage to continue my original profession, which was book selling, which I had now to do in my own account.

57:16.426 --> 57:20.713
So, however, having no other choice, I began to conduct my business from home on a small scale.

57:21.394 --> 57:25.099
It took several months until I found my confidence again in the exact point

57:25.400 --> 57:28.203
And that happened at the subject of a story which I have often told.

57:28.444 --> 57:29.044
May I read this?

57:29.124 --> 57:29.665
Yeah, sure.

57:29.705 --> 57:30.606
That's why I did that.

57:30.706 --> 57:35.812
One day I received the catalog of a rather indifferent book sale at the Swan Auction Galleries in New York.

57:35.832 --> 57:36.713
You know the Swan Auction.

57:36.753 --> 57:37.654
Very well.

57:37.915 --> 57:44.322
Included in this catalog was the description of a small incunable of a religious text which caught my eye.

57:44.583 --> 57:45.924
You know what an incunable is?

57:46.044 --> 57:46.985
Of course.

57:47.046 --> 57:49.488
Have you ever been an antiquarian book dealer?

57:50.109 --> 57:51.711
Well, when you see my book, you're going to see it.

57:51.995 --> 57:55.252
I say, okay, well, I don't know anything about your name.

57:55.474 --> 57:58.208
My book... And as I said to my friend...
