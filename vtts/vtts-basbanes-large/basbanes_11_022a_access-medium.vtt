00:02.866 --> 00:18.203
This is Tim Wilson talking in the halls of the library and the gay... You were talking about the Lou Sullivan collection.

00:18.223 --> 00:23.089
Right, which is the Gay and Latine Historical Society collection, one deposit here.

00:24.090 --> 00:30.257
And Lou Sullivan was born a woman...

00:31.587 --> 00:59.940
and became a gay man and set up a number of organizations, most notably the FTM International, Female to Male International, and published a few books which basically spelled out support

01:00.595 --> 01:07.081
groups and other facilities which would be useful to women who would hire.

01:07.741 --> 01:08.462
Sure.

01:08.482 --> 01:11.104
And was Sullivan a San Francisco person?

01:12.466 --> 01:13.647
And roughly when?

01:13.667 --> 01:14.688
He settled here.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.369
He was born elsewhere.

01:16.389 --> 01:19.852
But certainly he lived here, and so this is how this stuff entered the library.

01:20.333 --> 01:26.058
And when did he—is this person—is he still alive?

01:27.219 --> 01:28.780
He is dead.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.242
That's okay.

01:31.282 --> 01:32.783
That's an interesting detail, though.

01:33.064 --> 01:33.804
And what are the records?

01:34.225 --> 01:36.707
Is that part of this particular collection?

01:36.767 --> 01:40.891
No, those phonographs.

01:40.951 --> 01:42.092
That's part of Special Collections.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.994
There's a Wit and Humor collection up there.

01:44.014 --> 01:45.375
Okay, so that's not part of this.

01:46.256 --> 01:54.544
Although these videotapes are part of Dan Lesken.

01:54.584 --> 01:54.744
Okay.

01:54.764 --> 01:55.965
How is Edward III?

01:57.211 --> 01:58.072
Edward II.

01:58.132 --> 02:03.577
Edward II, looks like a three.

02:03.637 --> 02:07.420
This is the Derek German film.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.661
Oh, yeah.

02:13.526 --> 02:18.230
Edward II and his letter and all that kind of stuff.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.811
There you go.

02:21.693 --> 02:24.976
You have videotapes of whatever.

02:25.316 --> 02:25.737
Thanks, Tim.

02:26.417 --> 02:26.998
Appreciate it.

02:27.232 --> 02:35.341
Nice to meet you, too.

02:36.042 --> 02:45.552
We just got the files in San Francisco history from the AIDS Office of the Health Department, and we've already had researchers.

02:45.572 --> 02:51.118
What do you call these?

02:52.200 --> 02:52.860
Compact shelf.

02:52.941 --> 02:54.302
Yeah, thank you for getting that.

02:56.425 --> 03:02.533
They just built a brand new library in Cleveland, and these things, you know.

03:03.835 --> 03:08.642
This is special collection stuff, and then this is back to San Francisco history stuff.

03:08.662 --> 03:11.445
These are scrapbooks from different city departments.

03:11.466 --> 03:15.191
These are photographs from the call bulletins on the left.

03:15.872 --> 03:20.278
These are all photographs, photographs, photographs.

03:20.298 --> 03:24.323
Here's ephemera, old bottles, Chinese gambling paraphernalia.

03:25.062 --> 03:29.326
pottery, gifts to mayors, boxes are full of objects.

03:30.207 --> 03:32.229
We have building plans, architectural plans.

03:35.932 --> 03:41.357
This is where our oversized costumes, Dianne Feinstein's wedding dress.

03:41.497 --> 03:45.541
Oversized prints and photographs.

03:45.561 --> 03:47.102
Dianne Feinstein's wedding dress.

03:48.904 --> 03:52.367
Wonderful.

03:52.387 --> 03:53.348
You're funny.

03:53.851 --> 03:56.816
These are some of our oldest things.

03:56.836 --> 04:00.182
These are Alcalde records, back to when it was the Mexican government here.

04:00.503 --> 04:04.390
And these are some of the ledgers that actually survived the 1906 fire.

04:04.931 --> 04:07.435
So these are probably the most important things in our collection.

04:08.657 --> 04:10.480
They need a WPA archive.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.081
No, they're not.

04:11.161 --> 04:11.923
That's what it says.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.307
I know, because somebody here labeled it that way.

04:15.147 --> 04:21.125
The WPA did a survey of these, and the people here were able to figure out which volume went to the WPA survey.

04:21.145 --> 04:23.031
Tell me once again, because I wasn't told.

04:23.051 --> 04:25.679
These are all call day, which was before the mayor.

04:25.739 --> 04:26.963
There was an all call day.

04:28.107 --> 04:28.948
How do you spell it?

04:30.591 --> 04:31.813
A-L-C-A-L-D-E.

04:32.674 --> 04:32.995
Uh-huh.

04:33.035 --> 04:33.215
Which?

04:33.656 --> 04:35.939
And it goes back to the Mexican government.

04:36.079 --> 04:37.081
Before and about it.

04:37.101 --> 04:38.002
So this is old stuff.

04:38.062 --> 04:40.346
Yeah, it's probably some of the older stuff we have here.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.449
It's not old compared to the East Coast.

04:42.469 --> 04:44.432
I understand, but what exactly, what kind of material is it?

04:46.075 --> 04:47.076
Oh, we thought that.

04:47.096 --> 04:49.240
It was official papers, documents.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah, official papers, official city business.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.854
Can you give me a rough idea of what the years of that would be?

04:59.874 --> 05:02.178
Rough.

05:02.198 --> 05:04.141
Yeah, most of it's in the 1850s.

05:04.662 --> 05:07.407
But some of it might go back to 1840s, which would be old.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.011
But I think older than 1680.

05:10.652 --> 05:11.173
I know.

05:11.193 --> 05:11.694
But for us.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.597
Yeah.

05:14.619 --> 05:15.520
So we have this gold.

05:17.804 --> 05:20.288
Oh, there's some fascinating police photos.

05:21.213 --> 05:22.935
from about the turn of the century.

05:23.396 --> 05:24.477
I'm reading this book.

05:24.918 --> 05:26.941
Have you ever seen Luc Sante's book, Evidence?

05:27.361 --> 05:32.108
And he goes into a New York, he finds old glass plate narratives from the New York police.

05:32.128 --> 05:32.609
It's fascinating.

05:33.109 --> 05:33.570
I just got it.

05:33.590 --> 05:34.251
It's on my desk.

05:35.453 --> 05:35.733
Now.

05:36.434 --> 05:39.278
It's a beautiful, S-A-M-T-E.

05:40.079 --> 05:40.900
It's called Evidence.

05:42.322 --> 05:51.034
And he finds these police murders, basically, and then kind of talks about what it's like to look at these photos and, oh, it's really interesting.

05:51.014 --> 05:51.875
I love evidence.

05:51.895 --> 05:53.277
And you love, you know, archives.

05:53.477 --> 05:53.878
Oh, I do.

05:54.178 --> 05:58.144
Evidence is a very... I love things.

05:58.164 --> 06:05.774
There's so much you can... Which is why, you know, the computer's a computer, but there's so much you can tell from that.

06:05.794 --> 06:05.895
Okay.

06:07.657 --> 06:09.760
Bye, Tim!

06:09.780 --> 06:10.401
Thank you!

06:13.745 --> 06:15.247
So, yes.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.069
Interesting.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.333
I have a... You're welcome.

06:19.482 --> 06:22.405
Now, where am I supposed to take you?

06:22.925 --> 06:24.507
Maybe back to Andrea?

06:25.207 --> 06:25.507
Okay.

06:25.588 --> 06:25.948
Okay.

06:25.988 --> 06:28.010
You were asking me about the signage.

06:28.030 --> 06:31.973
I said, did you find a curious lack of signage?

06:32.033 --> 06:35.677
I see a lot of people who have their names.

06:35.697 --> 06:46.907
They have their names on there, and visitors will say, coming into this room, they have the lasting impression that the people gave us something to do with the library collections.

06:47.410 --> 07:14.818
this is not true they did not give one cent for any of the books or other marvelous things we have truly marvelous things here it is for furniture but the impression is that the people whose names are listed gave books and other library uh holdings to the library and this is not true that's my two cents for today i've got a lot of stuff instead of having a book list on the wall

07:15.541 --> 07:17.484
You can figure that one out by yourself.

07:17.524 --> 07:24.693
Ride the elevator soon.

07:25.094 --> 07:26.395
Thank you.

07:26.436 --> 07:27.377
Where is the sign?

07:27.417 --> 07:34.366
This is the Marjorie G. and Carl W. Stern Book Arts and Special Collection Center.

07:35.648 --> 07:38.832
Okay, just tell me your full name.

07:40.803 --> 07:42.305
My name's Annette McNair.

07:42.325 --> 07:43.587
You don't need a spelling bee.

07:43.647 --> 07:45.190
Okay, is that okay?

07:45.230 --> 07:48.315
Yeah, I want to be in the way of her dating.

07:49.036 --> 07:49.897
You won't.

07:49.917 --> 07:50.017
Okay.

07:50.077 --> 07:51.840
No, I'm too good for that anyway.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.224
Yeah, you might want to be in there.

07:54.244 --> 07:57.589
You probably have a better memory.

07:57.649 --> 07:58.951
I'm sorry.

07:59.031 --> 08:08.245
You just want Annette McNair, A-N-N-E-T-T-E, capital M-A-C, capital N-A-I-R, right?

08:08.545 --> 08:11.549
So you said you were a New Yorker, haven't you?

08:11.649 --> 08:11.949
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.652
How long have you been out here?

08:14.672 --> 08:17.115
Since the late 60s, about 66.

08:17.375 --> 08:17.836
Really?

08:17.996 --> 08:20.179
And working as a librarian?

08:20.199 --> 08:20.339
Uh-huh.

08:20.359 --> 08:23.042
Actually, I went to library school at UC Berkeley.

08:23.382 --> 08:24.003
Really?

08:24.664 --> 08:26.046
That's another story, isn't it?

08:26.066 --> 08:27.087
Right, it is another story.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.612
I'm going a little bit longer, by the way.

08:31.632 --> 08:32.113
Library school?

08:32.133 --> 08:33.795
Well, it's no longer called library school.

08:33.815 --> 08:35.597
It's full of information management, right.

08:35.777 --> 08:36.578
Does that bother you?

08:36.676 --> 08:37.257
Of course.

08:37.337 --> 08:41.643
I would never be—number one, I would never want to go, and number two, I probably wouldn't be admitted.

08:41.683 --> 08:48.132
Well, because first of all, it doesn't have anything to do with books.

08:48.332 --> 08:51.016
I'm not interested in information management.

08:51.036 --> 09:04.354
I'm interested in libraries as an institution, and as the basis for libraries, as far as I'm concerned, for public libraries are as an educational institution.

09:04.688 --> 09:08.071
And the School of Information Management hardly mentions libraries.

09:08.091 --> 09:13.376
It's all about record keeping and information access rather than about contents at all.

09:13.396 --> 09:20.041
And I think in order to be admitted, you have to have background in computer literacy, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

09:20.141 --> 09:22.564
But the bibliography is history.

09:22.584 --> 09:22.684
Yeah.

09:23.104 --> 09:27.007
And there aren't any classes in bibliography, as far as I can see.

09:27.388 --> 09:33.413
There aren't any of the classes that we took in book selection or in rare books or any of the

09:33.967 --> 09:41.880
I hate to use the word standing, but any of the courses we took as part of librarianship, as part of, you know, getting a master's in librarianship, don't exist in this school.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.142
Take a look at the .

09:43.162 --> 09:43.222
.

09:43.262 --> 09:43.643
.

09:43.663 --> 09:45.766
They say that UCLA is pretty good.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.870
I guess UCLA hasn't gone that way.

09:47.890 --> 09:49.372
Columbia, of course, did.

09:49.392 --> 09:50.594
Right, right.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.257
Yeah.

09:52.277 --> 09:52.297
.

09:52.357 --> 09:52.457
.

09:52.477 --> 09:52.618
.

09:52.678 --> 09:52.738
.

09:52.758 --> 09:52.858
.

09:52.878 --> 09:52.898
.

09:52.918 --> 09:53.339
.

09:53.379 --> 09:53.880
.

09:54.040 --> 09:54.060
.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.100
.

09:54.120 --> 09:54.361
.

09:54.381 --> 09:54.921
.

09:55.062 --> 09:55.242
.

09:55.262 --> 09:55.563
.

09:55.583 --> 09:55.703
.

09:55.743 --> 09:56.043
.

09:56.083 --> 09:56.324
.

09:56.364 --> 09:56.744
.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.225
.

09:57.245 --> 09:57.666
.

09:57.686 --> 09:57.706
.

09:57.726 --> 09:57.926
.

09:57.946 --> 09:58.027
.

09:58.087 --> 09:58.167
.

09:58.187 --> 09:58.287
.

09:58.672 --> 10:00.294
I'm interested in that.

10:00.374 --> 10:00.754
Okay.

10:00.794 --> 10:01.655
I think it is part.

10:01.695 --> 10:02.937
I think it really is part.

10:02.957 --> 10:04.118
They're a training librarian.

10:04.318 --> 10:04.899
Exactly.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.660
I mean, that is the part of it.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.204
And here, I mean, so in California, basically just have UCLA down south.

10:10.525 --> 10:12.847
And I really don't know what they're doing.

10:12.887 --> 10:14.329
I haven't heard about it.

10:14.349 --> 10:16.451
I just talked to Susan.

10:16.471 --> 10:18.313
She mentioned that UCLA is still prison.

10:18.333 --> 10:18.893
Susan Goldstein?

10:18.913 --> 10:20.115
Yeah, and she went to Bradyville.

10:20.455 --> 10:20.735
Yeah.

10:21.336 --> 10:22.317
So I don't, yeah.

10:22.499 --> 10:23.120
I don't know.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.545
Well, I know San Jose seems to be neither here nor there.

10:27.565 --> 10:28.586
Well, he's teaching.

10:28.626 --> 10:32.891
Yeah, I heard the so-called teaching.

10:32.912 --> 10:36.836
I have no idea what he's teaching, because he doesn't believe in libraries, you know?

10:36.916 --> 10:37.717
Well, it's on the net.

10:37.737 --> 10:41.602
This course is checking out the gasoline until all night.

10:41.722 --> 10:42.283
Oh, good.

10:42.303 --> 10:43.464
Take a wake-up pill.

10:43.484 --> 10:45.807
They're going to have a lot of clothing.

10:46.073 --> 10:48.576
I was with Tilly for three hours last night.

10:48.596 --> 10:49.137
Three hours.

10:49.157 --> 10:49.598
She's wonderful.

10:49.618 --> 10:50.058
Tilly Olsen?

10:50.118 --> 10:51.120
Yeah.

10:51.260 --> 10:52.321
Oh, good, yeah.

10:52.742 --> 10:54.284
She said, what do you want to say about it?

10:54.304 --> 10:55.385
I said, you just talk.

10:56.026 --> 10:56.807
I'm up here to listen.

10:57.488 --> 11:01.053
So you're really, yeah, you're getting a good spectrum.

11:01.814 --> 11:03.336
I saw Mr. Colter the other day.

11:03.676 --> 11:04.457
And he's a spectrum.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.604
He is, no, that one person, he's very interesting.

11:09.664 --> 11:14.190
I think he's like the focus of a lot of what's happened here.

11:14.660 --> 11:39.452
And this is way back in 89, when we had the earthquake, was my first real, quote, interaction with him, and he was completely uncaring about what staff had to say, wouldn't listen to anything, ran meetings in the most authoritarian, fascistic manner almost, you know, completely had to be in complete control.

11:39.820 --> 11:44.484
of every single meeting of the commission, wouldn't hear about what was really going on.

11:44.504 --> 11:52.311
The library closed for three months because they wanted to reorganize, and we spoke about what was involved and what the meaning of.

11:52.331 --> 11:53.872
I didn't want to hear anything.

11:54.092 --> 11:58.436
Well, and he named you all, by the way, so I know who you've been talking to, as you know.

11:59.357 --> 12:07.944
I've been trying to talk to everyone, so I said, with a name, a dozen names, you can probably write on ten of them, you know.

12:07.964 --> 12:09.405
But he named your name, and he named

12:09.908 --> 12:18.737
Kathy, and he named Melissa, you know, and I gave him an opportunity to temper his remark about the white women.

12:18.757 --> 12:19.638
Right, right.

12:19.678 --> 12:20.278
Talk levels.

12:20.419 --> 12:23.782
He didn't at all.

12:23.802 --> 12:27.666
I stand by it, and he accused me, actually, of being racist.

12:28.607 --> 12:29.548
Homophobic, right.

12:29.568 --> 12:31.730
Homophobic, antisemitic.

12:31.750 --> 12:38.717
So I'm telling you this both on, and I'll give you an opportunity to respond to his continued

12:39.170 --> 12:41.774
It's amazing to me.

12:41.815 --> 12:42.501
Yeah, exactly.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.813
It's amazing that he's saying this.

12:43.928 --> 12:45.569
And what is he basing all of this?

12:45.650 --> 12:47.471
I mean, what is his evidence?

12:48.212 --> 12:50.694
Because we oppose what he wants to do on Earth.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.335
The way you defend yourself sometimes is you attack.

12:53.276 --> 12:55.038
Right, yeah, obviously, yeah.

12:55.198 --> 12:59.542
It's the polygraph, the metaphor, you know, and what else are you going to say?

12:59.582 --> 13:05.067
Well, we remind him of 30s radical, and I said, well, thank you of reminding us that the class struggle still exists.

13:05.087 --> 13:06.288
I thought it was all over.

13:06.628 --> 13:07.809
We're creating a class struggle.

13:08.109 --> 13:12.433
But I think on the basis, you're saying, you know, the basis of what this is all about,

13:12.565 --> 13:17.611
is the fact that he really wants to establish the entrepreneurial library.

13:17.631 --> 13:29.864
He's represented the library without anyone, I mean, I don't know who's appointed him as a representative to all these entrepreneurial library discussion groups that they've had and workshops, et cetera.

13:30.625 --> 13:34.769
And he's come out all the time and saying, yes, we have to have private funding.

13:34.789 --> 13:37.172
Now, this is a big public policy issue.

13:37.355 --> 13:38.557
It's never been discussed.

13:38.897 --> 13:40.079
Who decided this?

13:40.339 --> 13:40.820
It was him.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.522
It wasn't even the commissioners decided this.

13:42.802 --> 13:46.347
Dallin and him had decided we were going to have a public-private partnership.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.691
And then we disagreed with him.

13:48.751 --> 13:53.918
That's when we came under, when we disagreed because we believed in a library being for everyone.

13:55.540 --> 14:02.129
But what you have to do on private funding, I mean, you know, as I mentioned, and you're from New York.

14:02.149 --> 14:02.489
Right.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.392
As I mentioned to Andrea, you know,

14:04.692 --> 14:09.318
The New York Public Library, called Leclerc, raises $30 million a year.

14:09.338 --> 14:10.420
But it's a different library.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.742
But it is a private library.

14:11.762 --> 14:12.703
Yeah, it is a private library.

14:12.723 --> 14:14.465
This is the public library.

14:14.806 --> 14:24.379
I mean, basically, when they had the proposal for this building proposition or the bond issue for this building, nothing was mentioned about private funding.

14:24.579 --> 14:29.286
This was going to be a public building and was basically going to go for books and staff.

14:29.726 --> 14:31.229
There was nothing else mentioned.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.513
And also, the kind of...

14:34.915 --> 14:48.255
projection of how the building would be publicly owned by the public, you know, in terms of the public bond issue, but that the interior would be privately raised.

14:48.636 --> 14:51.540
Now, I don't even know if that's in the original

14:51.757 --> 14:53.901
Proposition, was it?

14:53.981 --> 14:54.923
Of the MOU?

14:55.124 --> 14:58.190
No, no, the original bond issue.

14:58.370 --> 14:58.991
Oh, the bond issue?

14:59.011 --> 15:09.512
I don't think the bond issue doesn't mention, even private funds, doesn't mention anything about... But you acknowledge that raising some private money is not a bad thing.

15:09.661 --> 15:16.891
Well, it has to be discussed, because it all goes back, and I'm going to recommend an article you might want to read.

15:16.951 --> 15:19.374
I think really good for whatever you're trying to do.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.116
And this is in Metropolis.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.101
I don't know what I'm trying to do.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.282
In Metropolis.

15:26.464 --> 15:27.024
Read this one.

15:27.045 --> 15:28.767
I think it's good background.

15:28.787 --> 15:32.171
It's in Metropolis for March 1996.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.174
That's the name of the magazine?

15:34.194 --> 15:36.758
Yeah, and it's about library building and libraries of the future.

15:36.878 --> 15:38.360
March 1996.

15:38.400 --> 15:38.520
Right.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.922
Metropolis, and we have it here.

15:40.262 --> 15:44.808
You want to look at it?

15:45.068 --> 15:54.100
It's a great article because it talks about all the bond issues that are going for buildings and what that's really going to cost, the library in the future.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.605
I think, yeah, what it really means, what does it really mean, the public library?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.851
I mean, we've talked about undue influence.

16:02.931 --> 16:07.697
We've talked about libraries being taken out of the control of the people.

16:08.099 --> 16:11.864
And we really believe in a public-public partnership.

16:12.505 --> 16:18.574
And there are an awful lot of issues surrounding this, and the issues haven't been discussed.

16:18.594 --> 16:20.496
We were never included in any of that.

16:20.516 --> 16:21.097
That's the point.

16:21.378 --> 16:22.800
Exactly.

16:23.601 --> 16:24.802
Nothing has been discussed.

16:24.823 --> 16:31.592
And they created this foundation, which you might notice as the interlocking directorate of all these other so-called non-profit foundations.

16:31.910 --> 16:33.294
There's no accountability.

16:33.314 --> 16:35.802
They're non-profit, but they're not a membership group.

16:36.384 --> 16:37.627
So there's no accountability.

16:37.647 --> 16:38.711
We don't have the funds.

16:38.771 --> 16:40.015
No accountability.

16:40.035 --> 16:43.084
I didn't realize that you can't join it.

16:43.486 --> 16:44.768
That's right, you can't, no, no.

16:44.788 --> 16:45.870
That's very interesting.

16:45.890 --> 16:47.633
It's not a membership organization.

16:47.733 --> 16:48.695
So it's by invitation or by selection?

16:48.735 --> 16:49.717
Right, or by donation.

16:50.057 --> 16:52.842
Or even by donation, it's not certain that you can join it.

16:52.882 --> 16:53.964
Right, yeah.

16:53.984 --> 16:56.048
And it's a very selective group.

16:56.128 --> 16:57.611
Yeah, yeah, self-selecting.

16:57.631 --> 17:01.858
And do you think this foundation is basically returning the future in the direction of this library?

17:02.018 --> 17:02.980
They've tried to.

17:03.365 --> 17:07.270
And it's because of the library staff and the public that they haven't been successful.

17:07.851 --> 17:10.815
It's been very unclear as to what they're raising money for, how they're raising.

17:11.015 --> 17:19.005
There's so many issues, and just in terms of all these centers, basically they were saying, well, if you want a collection, you donate money for the collection.

17:19.025 --> 17:20.467
So we have this, yeah.

17:20.487 --> 17:23.010
So everything's being market-driven or driven by money.

17:23.031 --> 17:26.755
Everything is being also driven by those who donate money to collections.

17:26.795 --> 17:32.663
So the entire sense of the library is... And the sense of our control, you know, of our librarians controlling it,

17:32.643 --> 17:34.789
It is completely out of closure because

17:35.191 --> 17:54.259
Even physically, you have, one of the reasons we don't have room is that we have all these special centers, which are just spaces right now, and whoever contributed all this money, they have a space, but where they don't have, the collection is duplicate, yeah, the collection is duplicate of what we have, they don't have staff, etc.

17:54.499 --> 18:04.033
And mind those, if you have money, like American Indians don't have money, so they don't have a collection, the Jews don't have a collection, the Arabs don't have a collection, the Palestinians, I mean, all of that,

18:04.604 --> 18:12.235
is due to the foundation not having its own way in the sense of how it was going to raise money.

18:12.435 --> 18:22.630
It does seem to me that the intellectual direction is being determined by

18:23.150 --> 18:25.794
who has the money to sell in Filipino.

18:25.814 --> 18:26.635
That's right.

18:26.735 --> 18:27.756
Absolutely.

18:27.776 --> 18:29.178
Absolutely.

18:29.299 --> 18:31.942
It's driven by the donation.

18:31.962 --> 18:35.808
This is a very interesting collection that we can get.

18:35.828 --> 18:39.934
Maybe we can be on the cutting edge of this is where New Silicon Valley became.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.135
It's not about content.

18:41.155 --> 18:42.737
Yeah, we can get some stuff.

18:43.599 --> 18:45.001
It's not about content.

18:45.081 --> 18:45.281
Right.

18:45.561 --> 18:50.328
And that's also Dallin's vision is not about content.

18:50.348 --> 18:52.431
And also, yeah, Dallin doesn't feel...

18:52.411 --> 18:57.056
The library is an intellectual source.

18:57.417 --> 18:58.578
Can I ask him that?

18:58.658 --> 18:59.199
Yeah, right.

18:59.219 --> 18:59.740
Ask him what?

19:00.040 --> 19:07.809
Well, basically, he has stated in American libraries that librarians need to change their attitude from content to access.

19:07.829 --> 19:09.871
That's all we should be interested in is access.

19:10.412 --> 19:11.273
Forget content.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.537
Content is whatever... Meaningless.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.860
Yeah, it's whatever is being contributed.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.405
Let's change perspective from content

19:21.858 --> 19:26.525
to access, which, of course, access is a word they use on here.

19:26.545 --> 19:27.045
Oh, I know.

19:27.246 --> 19:28.808
Oh, it's disgraceful.

19:28.828 --> 19:29.549
It means nothing.

19:30.350 --> 19:33.134
It means horrible.

19:33.154 --> 19:36.318
That's the underground logo.

19:36.919 --> 19:39.022
I just covered mine.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.906
Anyway, and there's so many issues.

19:42.066 --> 19:49.857
So just getting back to the building and donations and philanthropy, et cetera, what this article talks about is the fact

19:50.090 --> 20:09.544
that communities are supporting, you know, these big bond issues for buildings, but no one is really talking about what library planners, he mentions old-time, so-called, quote, old-time library planners, that he said, they're going to be, really have regrets in five to ten years as to what maintenance of these buildings consists of.

20:10.286 --> 20:12.309
And we don't even have to wait five years.

20:12.349 --> 20:13.271
We waited one year.

20:13.311 --> 20:14.393
We waited one month.

20:14.609 --> 20:18.093
And we knew that most of the bulk of what this building costs to maintain.

20:18.574 --> 20:20.756
And as librarians, we raised questions.

20:21.577 --> 20:23.339
Years and years ago, we were just talking about it.

20:23.359 --> 20:26.563
We were saying, do you have a staffing pattern?

20:26.583 --> 20:29.527
What about the cost of all of the maintenance of the building?

20:30.007 --> 20:32.210
And we'll just have to wait.

20:32.270 --> 20:33.632
We'll have to see what the budget does.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.113
It was all very vague.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.415
I mean, there's a concern.

20:37.289 --> 21:04.191
you know, as to what we knew was going to come down, and we're going to compress, we're going to coalesce the collections, so it's come to such a really dumbing down of the scholarship nature of a library that, um, that humanities, at one point, one floor is humanities, literature, it was gardening, forces of history, biography, all in one, one

21:04.373 --> 21:08.882
very difficult to use plan and floor, no space for any books,

21:09.082 --> 21:13.489
Librarians were supposed to be ads from all those areas as though they had equal values.

21:13.969 --> 21:17.014
And then these special collections that people donated.

21:17.154 --> 21:17.475
Right.

21:17.495 --> 21:18.136
People donated.

21:18.156 --> 21:19.658
You know, these special collections.

21:19.919 --> 21:21.681
Well, those had all the space.

21:21.721 --> 21:23.063
That was taken up a lot of the room.

21:23.384 --> 21:26.949
So we were driven by those concepts of what people, you want a collection?

21:27.049 --> 21:27.370
Fine.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.133
Give us some money and we'll give you a collection.

21:29.193 --> 21:34.701
But there wasn't even any thought to the really rich collections of

21:34.681 --> 21:41.132
of the collections and the old departments, the literature and the history department that became the humanities department.

21:41.593 --> 21:49.305
There was no thought to what the collections held as part of the older collections and how they could grow accordingly.

21:49.346 --> 21:50.467
No, it was mushed down.

21:50.588 --> 21:52.010
And we did have strength.

21:52.030 --> 21:56.217
We had enormous strength, you know, in literature, poetry.

21:56.399 --> 22:01.090
drama, you know, the plays, a drama, history, biographies.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.796
And these are recent published books.

22:03.976 --> 22:12.315
No, no, no, we're talking, we're talking, well, for instance, the locked case books that used to be in the humanities department that are now in Brooks Hall,

22:12.751 --> 22:17.781
They were anywhere from the 16th to the 19th to the 20th centuries.

22:17.861 --> 22:19.384
There were 16th century books down there?

22:19.404 --> 22:22.490
Well, not too many anymore since they got transferred up to my department.

22:22.651 --> 22:23.753
I didn't see any of them.

22:23.773 --> 22:25.356
No, we transferred about them.

22:25.376 --> 22:28.162
Can you get me some titles of books that you've written down there?

22:28.242 --> 22:30.126
Oh, I'll show them to you.

22:30.386 --> 22:32.470
If you can come back up, I'll show you.

22:32.530 --> 22:33.392
Oh, yeah.

22:33.507 --> 22:39.854
And not only that, in poetry and in literature, what we used to buy was a lot of non-mainstream material.

22:39.874 --> 22:44.019
We were known as the small press poetry collection.

22:44.039 --> 22:47.082
Nothing is done that way, no.

22:47.223 --> 22:52.268
We have some of it, but we're not continuing that because there isn't any money.

22:52.328 --> 22:53.990
I mean, we're just getting mainstream stuff.

22:54.010 --> 22:55.912
Can you get the names of some of these poets that you have?

22:55.973 --> 22:56.393
Sure.

22:56.373 --> 22:59.877
They're in Brooks Hall also, in the Mekon section.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.601
The detail I need is essentially the same.

23:02.661 --> 23:04.103
Yeah, exactly.

23:04.323 --> 23:06.926
But you have a very interesting perspective.

23:06.946 --> 23:09.690
You've been here for 30 plus years.

23:09.710 --> 23:11.592
Not in the library, but in San Francisco.

23:11.612 --> 23:12.654
I've only been librarian.

23:12.794 --> 23:19.442
Well, I came here in 68 for a year, and then I was in various other libraries, and I've been here for 12 years, 11 years.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.024
We worked in the same department.

23:21.044 --> 23:22.386
But you have a perspective.

23:22.406 --> 23:23.207
Right, right.

23:23.542 --> 23:26.305
of librarianship, you know, of the development.

23:26.325 --> 23:28.207
So, do you have any comments on that?

23:28.588 --> 23:28.868
Yeah.

23:29.068 --> 23:41.362
Well, basically, I just kind of feel that one of the reasons I went into librarianship, and many of us did, was, to use the point sharing, was that we saw this was the People's University.

23:42.023 --> 23:48.951
Essentially, it wasn't just mass market buying and trendy centers and donor centers, etc.

23:49.391 --> 23:52.755
That the basis was this was an alternative education institution.

23:53.292 --> 23:57.059
and a rich one too, rich in selections of materials.

23:58.141 --> 24:06.316
And we also, at that time when I first entered, we were buying on a university level, like even in literature and literary criticism, etc.

24:06.336 --> 24:09.782
Yes, and now all of a sudden it's unclear, but it turns out

24:10.319 --> 24:14.925
with our limited budget, that we can even barely get the mainstream stuff that's in LJ.

24:14.945 --> 24:17.608
You know, that's kind of just basically reviewed in LJ.

24:17.788 --> 24:19.790
We used to go to all sorts of different sources.

24:19.810 --> 24:32.766
I got catalogs from the small press and from... So that's basically how acquisitions are driven, and how you read a review and publishes weekly, a leverage, or something like that.

24:32.786 --> 24:40.275
And basically, a monthly selection list, which is what the branches order from, is what the main library now, our big department,

24:40.424 --> 24:56.442
is practically every set, every Dewey number, well, it's changing now because it's a total mess and hadn't worked, but it had been every Dewey number, is now by branch list rather than, we used to generate the list and maybe just pick up popular stuff, you know, like we thought we should have.

24:56.923 --> 25:03.730
But, you know, basically we were an enriched, enriched collection, and now it's barely even a basic collection.

25:04.451 --> 25:05.993
And then certain

25:06.412 --> 25:11.437
All of a sudden, certain people are still buying, but the business department, they buy all over the damn place.

25:11.897 --> 25:13.078
They have a huge budget.

25:13.498 --> 25:18.063
The business department's budget is more than, I think, the entire general collection.

25:18.163 --> 25:26.250
Well, it's a continuation of the Dowling vision, where they're a focused collection, and humanities is just the level of access.

25:26.350 --> 25:31.074
So, yeah, the concept of focused collections, I don't know what that means.

25:31.175 --> 25:33.837
I know how much money is for doing this.

25:34.188 --> 25:37.196
Can we get a copy of the budget?

25:37.697 --> 25:38.881
Yeah, I've got a copy.

25:38.901 --> 25:40.144
I can make a copy of it for you.

25:40.625 --> 25:43.152
The latest budget, it's pretty disheartening.

25:43.212 --> 25:44.957
Very disheartening.

25:44.997 --> 25:47.243
Can I get a couple of this one and the last one?

25:47.263 --> 25:50.712
The last one, I'm trying to think.

25:51.097 --> 25:54.102
I'd love to see how it's changed over here.

25:54.142 --> 25:56.726
Well, actually, the one you should take a look at is the 94, or 94?

25:56.806 --> 25:58.388
Yeah, right.

25:59.149 --> 26:02.374
My Book Arts and Special Collections had $20,000.

26:02.514 --> 26:04.798
Yeah, but also he should even look like it was 88 or 89.

26:04.818 --> 26:06.100
Yeah, I know, absolutely.

26:06.120 --> 26:11.288
What we were doing, you know, literature departments, and we were able to... They should have it on record.

26:11.308 --> 26:14.933
We should have it on record for the budget, you know.

26:15.154 --> 26:17.277
I was like, look at the 88 budget.

26:17.297 --> 26:17.998
Yeah, look at it.

26:18.248 --> 26:20.793
Before he came.

26:21.274 --> 26:21.755
Exactly.

26:22.817 --> 26:24.861
All of this, it was interesting enough.

26:24.881 --> 26:30.412
This is going to be some of the stuff that... Who's the gentleman?

26:31.113 --> 26:31.454
Kerwin.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.195
Jim Kerwin.

26:32.476 --> 26:32.777
Biller.

26:32.957 --> 26:33.618
Walter.

26:34.019 --> 26:38.147
Oh, I don't know if he'll have... He's sending me boxes of them.

26:38.347 --> 26:57.722
i know and then and then guess where guess who gets it after you he has a lot of sending it i think it's i think he said he would like it i think you're walking you're walking out because i think he's got a lot of stuff he's always at his house yesterday it's just amazing he's gonna send a ups actually simply tell me do you have like do you have

26:57.905 --> 27:00.627
Like everything that happened at the earthquake time?

27:00.908 --> 27:03.930
Because that was, interestingly enough, it was an act of God.

27:04.211 --> 27:06.733
That really helped all of us along.

27:06.753 --> 27:07.393
Helped.

27:07.934 --> 27:09.255
It didn't help us along.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.336
No, no, it helped us along.

27:10.356 --> 27:11.057
It helped, yeah.

27:11.337 --> 27:14.480
Helped the, you know, whatever it is.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.924
Well, in our files, in the archives, in the SFPL archives, there's a lot of stuff.

27:18.944 --> 27:21.106
You know, newspaper clippings from that period.

27:22.547 --> 27:27.051
Because when Dallin first came in 88, and he came to the literature department,

27:27.368 --> 27:29.610
And I had some weird doubts about him.

27:29.910 --> 27:35.896
He was hired, actually, to create this new building, this new library.

27:36.396 --> 27:42.742
And his concepts, even then, were so frightening that I was reading, when I went to, I did read The Electronic Library.

27:43.243 --> 27:44.364
And you have read that.

27:44.384 --> 27:45.124
Have you looked at this?

27:45.445 --> 27:47.206
And he says, you know, libraries are passed out.

27:47.246 --> 27:48.688
And we started asking questions.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.650
Like, what's the role of librarians?

27:50.670 --> 27:53.292
I mean, we've developed subject expertise.

27:53.312 --> 27:56.515
You know, we're interested in equality in desk collections.

27:56.714 --> 27:59.038
We see our function as educational.

27:59.239 --> 27:59.980
You know, what's going to happen?

28:00.000 --> 28:04.909
He says, oh, well, we'll have these volunteered, retired scholars in residence.

28:05.410 --> 28:06.893
And what are librarians supposed to do?

28:07.393 --> 28:10.158
Well, you're going to manage, we're going to have fewer librarians.

28:10.279 --> 28:11.962
Immediately, he started cutting staff.

28:12.342 --> 28:19.836
I mean, his first proposal, the first time there was a city budget crisis, and the departments were asked to just look at their budgets.

28:20.137 --> 28:24.483
No other department in the city recommended cutting staff, and he did.

28:25.064 --> 28:26.066
He said, and he cut.

28:26.086 --> 28:28.229
He cut staff right immediately.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.152
Well, certain administrations left them.

28:30.312 --> 28:31.474
Immediately cut staff.

28:31.534 --> 28:34.298
I remember even writing, I guess we have a whole list of that.

28:34.899 --> 28:35.479
Check it out.

28:35.499 --> 28:38.804
I'm curious how much staff he cut.

28:39.726 --> 28:40.627
He cut.

28:40.947 --> 28:43.491
Well, at that point, he was going to cut a lot.

28:43.511 --> 28:46.195
He didn't replace people, but he did cut, and then...

28:46.968 --> 28:52.875
Then there was a big plus, thanks, reunion, et cetera, and he had to rehire practically everybody.

28:52.955 --> 28:53.836
He had to rehire.

28:53.856 --> 28:58.822
But his first suggestion was to cut staff, and he always talks about the biggest service points.

28:59.783 --> 29:12.317
He thought on the third floor, we would have one person at each, one desk for the entire floor, for all these subject areas, and have one person, one librarian at least, so-called, he didn't even call them

29:12.567 --> 29:16.772
reference, we call them service points, you know, so they were, it was like a floor plan.

29:17.092 --> 29:21.177
And he does talk about the library as a mall, because the library is the mall.

29:21.197 --> 29:22.198
Oh, mall of the mind.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.099
Mall of the mind.

29:23.780 --> 29:34.972
Because I quoted Susan Sontag, yeah, I quoted Susan Sontag, who said that she went to the Chicago Public Library, the Chicago Public Library, and she said, I always conceived of the library as a theater of the mind.

29:35.853 --> 29:39.037
I said, I consider it as a mall of the mind.

29:39.057 --> 29:40.339
That's right.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.680
Chicago Public Library.

29:41.896 --> 29:47.802
Yeah, because it was a program on libraries and librarianship, and so I've been just, and just a library has so many different levels.

29:47.822 --> 29:49.404
It's like a theater of the mind.

29:49.424 --> 29:49.524
Sure.

29:49.544 --> 29:51.506
I mean, that was her kind of metaphor.

29:51.806 --> 29:53.668
I'm hoping they don't have to deal with her.

29:53.969 --> 29:55.050
Oh, good.

29:55.070 --> 29:55.350
Oh, great.

29:55.450 --> 29:56.611
Yeah.

29:56.932 --> 29:57.672
Oh.

29:57.692 --> 30:00.996
I just didn't want you to send her two weeks ago for this new book.

30:01.016 --> 30:01.737
Mm-hmm.

30:01.757 --> 30:06.742
Yeah, because she was really, she was, this was about libraries, and she was mentioning, and... You were there?

30:06.762 --> 30:08.183
It was on the radio.

30:08.203 --> 30:08.764
When was it?

30:09.031 --> 30:11.514
Two or three years ago.

30:11.614 --> 30:12.075
Yeah.

30:12.496 --> 30:13.497
When Chicago Public.

30:13.557 --> 30:13.857
Yeah.

30:14.038 --> 30:17.642
It's when we were still, just before we were moving in here.

30:18.043 --> 30:18.744
Yeah.

30:18.764 --> 30:28.456
And they still have literature department, the history department.

30:28.476 --> 30:29.257
Exactly.

30:29.438 --> 30:32.001
And this guy here.

30:32.318 --> 30:36.826
This is Roberto, who said, oh, that's the most dysfunctional library.

30:37.026 --> 30:39.390
I mean, he's like, you have libraries, them all, you know, just go shop.

30:39.410 --> 30:43.677
This is Roberto, the acting chief of Maine.

30:44.278 --> 30:46.863
You haven't interviewed him yet?

30:47.324 --> 30:51.070
He called the Chicago Public Library.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.513
I haven't been there, so I can't comment.

30:53.533 --> 30:54.895
He said, we won't be the same.

30:54.915 --> 30:57.478
This was just while we were planning, quote-unquote, for this library.

30:57.758 --> 30:58.900
He says, because we're planning.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.962
We're planning a big mess.

31:01.823 --> 31:02.825
This is a template.

31:02.845 --> 31:03.566
We're planning.

31:03.586 --> 31:04.687
Oh, that was the other term.

31:04.727 --> 31:07.250
The template.

31:07.270 --> 31:08.632
Oh, the template.

31:08.812 --> 31:10.915
I never hear that word again.

31:10.935 --> 31:11.375
I'll be happy.

31:11.395 --> 31:16.121
Template is used like when you're doing quilting, and it's a pattern so that you'll fit it in.

31:16.321 --> 31:17.563
You know, it's like a metal...

31:17.932 --> 31:20.115
triangle if you're going to use it in a quilt pattern.

31:20.516 --> 31:27.206
So you make sure that you create this pattern piece so the pattern won't be correct.

31:27.446 --> 31:28.948
So it matches there.

31:28.968 --> 31:30.210
So it matches, so it'll fit in.

31:30.510 --> 31:35.017
So they try to do, after the earthquake, with the old main library.

31:35.157 --> 31:38.863
The biggest main there was a reorganization, was a template for the new main.

31:39.463 --> 31:42.127
So first of all, you said it isn't a template because it's not equal.

31:42.147 --> 31:46.774
I mean, you do a pattern for a piece that is similar, you know, what you want.

31:46.990 --> 31:51.837
The old man was not similar to this at all, so even the term was in the book.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.359
I mean, why use the word template?

31:53.699 --> 31:57.184
Well, we all understood this, but we couldn't understand why they didn't understand.

31:57.244 --> 32:03.072
Because it wasn't anything like what this was going to be like.

32:03.453 --> 32:07.638
But it was like, well, it was a template for a mess.

32:07.939 --> 32:11.023
I mean, what do you do at the wedding?

32:11.543 --> 32:17.052
I'm the Reference Librarian at the General Collections and Humanities Department.

32:17.953 --> 32:22.260
Some of us refuse to call it General Collections, we call it Humanities.

32:22.340 --> 32:28.570
I always actually say Humanities and General Collections, that General Collections means nothing.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.034
It means nothing, because it isn't the General Collection.

32:31.054 --> 32:33.838
And this is the General Collection used to be, it's now...

32:33.818 --> 32:34.939
A conglomerate.

32:34.959 --> 32:35.400
A conglomerate.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.801
You're telling me the other way.

32:36.821 --> 32:36.922
Yes.

32:36.982 --> 32:37.803
Literature.

32:38.063 --> 32:40.245
Literature and religion.

32:40.266 --> 32:41.467
What was the other one?

32:41.527 --> 32:43.810
Biopathy, history, and social sciences.

32:43.970 --> 32:44.671
And the humanities.

32:44.771 --> 32:46.012
And then they were merged.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.674
That was the great merger of the earthquake.

32:47.694 --> 32:48.555
They merged with sports.

32:49.336 --> 32:51.318
After the earthquake, they merged it with sports.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.142
The general collection is also sports.

32:54.222 --> 32:54.642
Sports.

32:55.023 --> 32:55.744
No, no.

32:55.884 --> 32:57.826
Sports in the new Maine.

32:57.886 --> 32:58.246
Yeah.

32:58.266 --> 33:03.032
In the new Maine, they further merged humanities with sports, science,

33:03.350 --> 33:13.201
Recreation, all recreation, cookery, cooking, gardening, sewing, dogs.

33:13.721 --> 33:16.224
Pets, plants, three peas.

33:16.384 --> 33:20.068
Pets, plants.

33:20.168 --> 33:21.269
Pets, plants.

33:21.289 --> 33:23.332
Pets, plants.

33:23.352 --> 33:24.613
Pets, plants.

33:24.633 --> 33:25.874
Pets, plants.

33:25.935 --> 33:29.138
What are some of the others that they have?

33:29.118 --> 33:30.480
What are some of the other collections?

33:30.981 --> 33:31.642
Art and music.

33:31.882 --> 33:32.624
Art and music.

33:32.824 --> 33:35.087
I mean, that's separate, not part of general.

33:35.368 --> 33:35.809
That's right.

33:35.869 --> 33:39.975
Art and music are separate, and then business and technology are separate.

33:40.115 --> 33:41.177
They remain intact.

33:41.217 --> 33:42.319
They remain intact, right.

33:42.619 --> 33:46.586
In fact, they've got more money, more... Now, why do you suppose that is?

33:46.886 --> 33:55.800
Well, one of the reasons is that art and music fought ferociously to maintain their...

33:56.388 --> 33:59.952
the scholarly element in their collections.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.955
How did they manage to win, though?

34:01.975 --> 34:10.325
Well, they had a pretty tough department head for a very long time, and it must have rubbed off on the entire staff because they just refused to go along with the process.

34:10.345 --> 34:23.020
Yeah, well, I asked that question to Kathy Page, just in terms of how it's decided that we have certain departments, you know, we maintain their integrity, and ours was just, well,

34:23.708 --> 34:34.917
Actually, Mr. Dallin thought the entire library should be just one big general collection, but he was persuaded, and we don't know how he was persuaded, and I think partially is because

34:35.673 --> 34:37.497
They had a donation of the sheet music.

34:37.537 --> 34:38.139
Oh, that's right.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.121
See, it's run by donors.

34:39.181 --> 34:41.085
He had a donation for sheet music.

34:41.105 --> 34:41.787
Oh, and the Steve Silver Room.

34:41.807 --> 34:41.947
Right.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.972
And the Steve Silver Room, so they had donations.

34:43.992 --> 34:49.084
Well, that partially is true, but they also had, they had very, those staff members, those librarians.

34:49.164 --> 34:54.897
Yeah, I don't think he would move, because I don't know whether Andrea showed up, because we had a petition even up to the very end.

34:54.877 --> 35:03.128
saying that this conglomeration, this general reference of leveling of access is not going to work.

35:03.248 --> 35:04.590
This is the 91 petition.

35:04.610 --> 35:09.096
This is the 95 petition about the mega department.

35:09.116 --> 35:10.538
He called it a mega department.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.963
I'm putting everything in this envelope for you, okay?

35:15.244 --> 35:19.990
Including the recent report on the humidity and environmental conditions at Book Hall.

35:20.425 --> 35:23.990
He's getting a headache.

35:24.010 --> 35:28.116
Please get you a headache right away.

35:28.176 --> 35:29.498
We've all had a headache at the opening.

35:29.558 --> 35:31.240
You see, it's an attempt.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.765
It's an attempt in Donald's mind, because he's a man, actually, he's very limited.

35:34.785 --> 35:36.708
He's a Philistine, really.

35:36.888 --> 35:38.531
No, he's a barbarian.

35:38.711 --> 35:39.572
Very limited.

35:39.873 --> 35:42.877
Technologically, I mean, no one even knows.

35:43.017 --> 35:46.382
He's sort of the pastiche of, who's that, Naismith?

35:46.733 --> 35:48.335
and the Third Way.

35:48.515 --> 35:49.175
Oh, yeah.

35:49.255 --> 35:49.996
Is it Naismith?

35:50.056 --> 35:51.337
Yeah, Topler, Topler, yeah.

35:51.538 --> 35:52.879
Topler, and is it Naismith?

35:52.899 --> 35:53.840
Is it Jim Naismith?

35:54.360 --> 35:55.942
Oh, yeah.

35:55.962 --> 35:56.903
Yeah, you know those people.

35:56.923 --> 35:59.945
So that piece of books, and even that is, well, he's stuck in a time war.

35:59.965 --> 36:01.147
Well, he's not even stuck.

36:01.227 --> 36:05.110
He's really kind of a very illiterate person, basically.

36:05.411 --> 36:09.935
And I think he's really opposed to culture, to libraries, and to popular control.

36:10.075 --> 36:12.397
Anti-book.

36:12.858 --> 36:15.340
I was with Nick Blinker yesterday, and he has a

36:15.691 --> 36:20.499
We finally got the computer thing of the books, you know, the 19,000 last books.

36:21.240 --> 36:21.420
Right.

36:22.021 --> 36:25.667
And I said, all right, this is 18, 19, 19.

36:25.727 --> 36:28.852
Did they have a record of all the books that were sent?

36:29.313 --> 36:31.556
I mean, do you at least keep a record of them?

36:31.897 --> 36:32.137
No.

36:32.197 --> 36:34.441
Do we know that that has some value?

36:34.561 --> 36:35.643
Yes, it does, yes.

36:35.663 --> 36:36.985
Even if we've gotten rid of them.

36:37.005 --> 36:38.407
So we're not knowing at some point.

36:38.467 --> 36:39.489
That we did have them.

36:39.609 --> 36:42.694
Exactly, yes.

36:43.096 --> 36:45.339
That's intellectually inexcusable.

36:45.459 --> 36:46.040
It is.

36:46.140 --> 36:50.807
And he said, well, that's because it's anti-intellectual.

36:52.810 --> 36:57.096
And underneath it all, this is Del, I mean, is kind of a nasty piece.

36:57.136 --> 37:02.104
He really is a nasty piece of work, because he can understand intellectual discourse among librarians.

37:02.444 --> 37:04.447
So he thinks, basically, you know.

37:04.547 --> 37:05.248
That you're the enemy.

37:05.268 --> 37:05.709
Right, yeah.

37:05.749 --> 37:08.272
But this goes for both Del and Colter.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.194
They're two of them.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.117
They're partners in all of them.

37:11.697 --> 37:12.799
I always take a question.

37:13.201 --> 37:16.124
He was basically ready for everything I asked him.

37:16.304 --> 37:18.086
He had a good answer for everything.

37:18.106 --> 37:22.811
But the one that kind of stuck in his tracks was, I said, what books do you read?

37:23.292 --> 37:24.814
That's the only question I want to ask him.

37:24.834 --> 37:26.776
What's the last book you read Mr. Colter, quickly?

37:26.956 --> 37:29.839
He couldn't give me a title.

37:29.859 --> 37:31.661
Oh, I've read hundreds of books in my house.

37:32.582 --> 37:36.546
I said, well, can you describe your library for me?

37:36.566 --> 37:39.690
I shouldn't have been smiling, but I was.

37:39.710 --> 37:41.772
He's got a lot of science fiction apparently.

37:41.892 --> 37:42.853
He likes science fiction.

37:42.833 --> 37:46.277
No.

37:46.377 --> 37:47.646
No, he doesn't.

37:48.031 --> 37:49.633
He doesn't have it from this line.

37:49.713 --> 37:50.494
Not from this line.

37:50.514 --> 37:51.395
He doesn't have it from here.

37:51.475 --> 37:53.116
He doesn't have a library card here.

37:53.136 --> 37:55.239
I mean, we have it.

37:55.259 --> 37:57.021
I mean, it's hard for us to check.

37:57.041 --> 37:57.141
Yeah.

37:57.201 --> 37:58.502
Oh, we can check that.

37:58.522 --> 38:00.204
I don't want the card.

38:01.265 --> 38:02.026
No.

38:02.066 --> 38:02.787
We can.

38:02.807 --> 38:04.468
We could fix everything.

38:04.529 --> 38:06.210
No, no.

38:06.290 --> 38:09.033
We can get into the circulation first.

38:09.053 --> 38:10.895
Well, it's been checked out anyhow.

38:10.935 --> 38:13.498
People don't have a library card.

38:13.478 --> 38:16.729
No, that's one of the questions I was going to ask.

38:16.749 --> 38:17.973
Many poppers have checked already.

38:18.053 --> 38:20.000
I was going to ask the last commission.

38:20.361 --> 38:21.645
Yeah, that's right.

38:21.826 --> 38:23.792
At the last commission meeting, I was going to...

38:23.958 --> 38:24.579
to the first thing.

38:24.959 --> 38:26.961
Quickly now, what book are you reading right now?

38:26.981 --> 38:28.822
Well, what was the last book you read?

38:29.323 --> 38:32.886
I didn't want to do that conversation.

38:32.966 --> 38:39.912
I just said, gee, you know, tell me he's a state rep from Nevada, Fort Turner from Rio.

38:40.092 --> 38:40.653
So what?

38:40.913 --> 38:42.855
Well, this is the background.

38:42.975 --> 38:44.256
But that doesn't mean anything.

38:44.336 --> 38:45.637
No, no, no, first it does not.

38:45.657 --> 38:50.221
And I said, but can you give me some idea how it was that you were selected to have this board?

38:50.722 --> 38:53.104
I said, generally speaking, you get people

38:53.084 --> 38:57.693
You know, I know I'm the past president of the Friends, I've got it live in the Clark University.

38:57.773 --> 38:59.296
That was a perfect choice for that.

38:59.316 --> 39:00.819
I believe my life is books.

39:00.899 --> 39:01.821
I care about books.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.764
I care about my boys.

39:04.506 --> 39:13.202
So, how did you, as a PR man, he couldn't even give me a job description for what he does for the whole book I mean.

39:13.503 --> 39:18.362
Well, it's public relations, but it's really not public relations.

39:18.643 --> 39:20.330
It's community relations.

39:20.410 --> 39:21.374
Outreach.

39:21.394 --> 39:23.462
How does a powerful company deal with AIDS?

39:23.729 --> 39:28.713
You know, just dare me to question him on that one.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.875
You know, that's a political thing.

39:30.976 --> 39:32.797
But my point is, he's a piano.

39:32.957 --> 39:35.680
But that, you know, in a way... It's so ironic.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.521
But it's so ironic.

39:36.601 --> 39:38.562
It's also that he's... He's a flatman.

39:38.602 --> 39:39.823
He's to get the business for the club.

39:39.924 --> 39:41.665
I mean, get him in a comic library.

39:41.845 --> 39:44.908
I mean, do you know what... I guess Walter will give you this.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.630
You know what our phone bill has been?

39:46.650 --> 39:47.731
I mean, there's that connection.

39:47.751 --> 39:53.736
He obviously has conflicts of interest, and he keeps denying it, because he doesn't have any interest in the library than the decision.

39:53.969 --> 39:57.035
And that's why you should speak with John Barry at LJ, also.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.738
John Barry, the editor-in-chief.

39:59.119 --> 40:02.325
He's very clear on the whole conflict of interest.

40:02.345 --> 40:03.247
He understands it.

40:04.089 --> 40:05.311
Has he written about it here?

40:05.772 --> 40:06.974
The conflict of interest?

40:08.016 --> 40:10.020
Not yet.

40:10.777 --> 40:12.720
He knows about the story of Chris.

40:13.641 --> 40:16.225
Well, he has a little bit that he sent us.

40:16.525 --> 40:17.727
Well, the role of the radical.

40:18.128 --> 40:20.291
No, he has that bit that he sent us.

40:20.311 --> 40:33.069
The fact that the Pacific Bell is now being taken over by this SBC who is against libraries having discounts, libraries and schools having discounts on technology.

40:33.149 --> 40:34.371
No, I think he did.

40:34.604 --> 40:43.234
I don't think he's smart.

40:43.335 --> 40:45.964
I think he's

40:46.552 --> 40:48.575
PR, very PR-oriented.

40:48.635 --> 40:49.997
And he has friends.

40:50.037 --> 40:52.721
The point is that he does have friends in city government.

40:53.182 --> 40:53.563
Yeah.

40:53.583 --> 40:54.684
But he's caused a fear.

40:54.724 --> 40:57.669
Barbara Kelsman is the head of the Board of Superbloges.

40:57.849 --> 41:01.274
He's worked on her campaign committee for re-election, et cetera.

41:01.294 --> 41:02.095
So we have Klaus.

41:02.877 --> 41:08.906
But as far as... And Klaus has contributed to Willie Brown's campaign.

41:09.847 --> 41:13.993
He should be working with the community because he's caused such devastation.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.816
Well, for instance, then...

41:17.180 --> 41:26.415
The people who have been most carried by this building are the serious readers.

41:26.475 --> 41:28.618
Everyone else has been catered to.

41:28.819 --> 41:33.366
People, the donors, the so-called non-readers, etc., which we should.

41:33.616 --> 41:37.423
but the serious reader has been completely disregarded.

41:37.824 --> 41:38.845
And that's it.

41:38.926 --> 41:50.086
The people who... That's been really the unkindest cut has been to the serious... To our everlasting sadness, because we thought from the very beginning we raised questions about all of this.

41:50.166 --> 41:52.951
We raised questions about the role of the Humanities Department.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.173
We raised questions about...

41:54.777 --> 42:03.147
you know, its strengths, and the community, the literary community, and all of this, and how it was going, how the New Main Library was going to include them.

42:03.567 --> 42:07.351
Never any answer.

42:07.612 --> 42:10.996
There's never any dialogue going on between Dow and staff.

42:11.016 --> 42:13.418
We were all talking for ourselves.

42:13.438 --> 42:13.659
Okay, good.

42:13.819 --> 42:14.620
I'm looking for another one.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.401
We were talking for ourselves.

42:15.421 --> 42:17.583
Conversation, conversation.

42:17.603 --> 42:18.504
Discourse is great.

42:18.865 --> 42:21.848
And, yeah, he just rolls her eyes.

42:22.064 --> 42:26.689
And every time there's this big sigh from Coulter, we get up in the commission meeting.

42:27.030 --> 42:28.511
It's as though, oh, don't bother me.

42:28.531 --> 42:29.913
It's just a waste of time.

42:29.933 --> 42:31.174
Yeah, but she said she actually applied.

42:31.194 --> 42:33.657
She wanted to be on the citizens' advisory committee.

42:33.677 --> 42:33.997
Yeah, right.

42:34.017 --> 42:36.320
And who's more qualified in this woman?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.922
Well, we have problems with that.

42:38.042 --> 42:40.324
Not her, but, yeah.

42:40.945 --> 42:44.108
About it being implemented.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.490
It's removing...

42:45.723 --> 42:48.332
the professionals from the front they think, you know?

42:48.754 --> 42:50.239
It's creating another layer.

42:50.279 --> 42:55.176
Yeah, it's not going to do our work, it's like... To put it in football, I mean, you don't let...

42:55.325 --> 42:57.187
one of the alumni call the place.

42:57.207 --> 42:59.589
I mean, the coach calls the place.

42:59.709 --> 43:00.730
That's the job.

43:00.750 --> 43:00.990
Exactly.

43:01.010 --> 43:03.653
It's not letting us do our work, basically.

43:04.153 --> 43:05.074
It's censoring our work.

43:05.114 --> 43:06.075
It's basically censoring our work.

43:06.095 --> 43:07.356
Work is trained to do right now.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.157
Yeah, exactly.

43:08.257 --> 43:09.218
And we have experience.

43:09.818 --> 43:10.659
And this is what we do.

43:10.699 --> 43:11.240
We do.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.643
We're obviously tuned into what the needs are.

43:14.763 --> 43:19.287
I mean, this is what our training and our experience and our background and our commitments are.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.149
We don't need another sensor, another thing.

43:21.169 --> 43:22.210
Oh, this woman, a cook.

43:22.493 --> 43:31.588
The last outposts of scoundrels.

43:32.169 --> 43:33.512
These are desperate people.

43:33.692 --> 43:38.841
He's not questioning what he's saying.

43:39.081 --> 43:41.385
He's just questioning his use of terms.

43:41.906 --> 43:43.168
I mean, basically,

43:43.334 --> 43:46.441
We can take what he says.

43:46.461 --> 43:53.075
He's calling all these people names, including us, because he cannot do what he wants to be like.

43:53.737 --> 43:54.458
And what?

43:54.478 --> 43:56.363
Where's the evidence?

43:56.483 --> 43:59.469
I asked him that because you don't reach out.

43:59.570 --> 44:03.418
I said, well, reach out.

44:03.584 --> 44:06.748
They're librarians.

44:06.868 --> 44:07.969
They embrace.

44:08.410 --> 44:09.752
Every single day.

44:09.912 --> 44:10.833
Every single day.

44:11.133 --> 44:13.416
My answer is they embrace.

44:13.456 --> 44:16.660
They don't run down the street and grab you by the neck.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.321
The material is there.

44:17.641 --> 44:18.242
People come.

44:19.003 --> 44:20.385
We do it in many different ways.

44:21.246 --> 44:22.528
And who does he reach out?

44:22.608 --> 44:24.610
He has no idea.

44:24.690 --> 44:27.674
He's using that term because there's no evidence that we don't reach out.

44:28.034 --> 44:30.958
First of all, what does that mean?

44:31.208 --> 44:33.773
It's actually pretty sad.

44:33.913 --> 44:38.722
Actually, he's just using clichés and doesn't really respond to anything, to any idea.

44:38.762 --> 44:42.348
And then what he said was, and I said, well, tell me how you came to this design.

44:43.089 --> 44:45.133
And he traveled, he told me about his travels.

44:46.666 --> 44:50.272
The entire library would be the gay Schumberg.

44:50.392 --> 44:53.257
First of all, there's a new gay center being built.

44:53.397 --> 44:54.318
It has all of this.

44:54.519 --> 44:58.205
This represents a commonality.

44:58.245 --> 44:59.867
This is part of the discourse.

44:59.967 --> 45:03.633
Okay, that's intellectually defensible.

45:03.653 --> 45:04.675
It's straight.

45:04.823 --> 45:06.788
But that's not what he has in the 90s.

45:06.828 --> 45:09.315
He said, look at the picture of the beautiful ceiling.

45:09.555 --> 45:11.541
You don't even have that girl in there.

45:11.581 --> 45:12.764
No, no, no.

45:12.824 --> 45:14.268
And it's dispersed all over.

45:14.328 --> 45:16.193
Well, that's why it's fine.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.837
But the problem is that

45:18.138 --> 45:20.640
He is narrowly focused on one thing.

45:20.740 --> 45:22.061
Everything else can go to hell.

45:22.662 --> 45:23.843
No, and it's not only that.

45:23.863 --> 45:29.648
It's also the fact that he got a real gay billionaire to contribute a lot of money, the Hormel Collection.

45:29.908 --> 45:31.590
No, it's not a collection.

45:31.610 --> 45:32.951
It's not a collection.

45:32.991 --> 45:36.234
We have people calling and saying, is this the Hormel Library?

45:36.274 --> 45:37.956
No, it isn't the Hormel Library.

45:37.976 --> 45:39.777
It doesn't even have a Hormel Collection yet.

45:39.797 --> 45:40.238
It's not a Hormel.

45:40.258 --> 45:41.078
It's the Hormel Room.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.860
No, it was great.

45:42.880 --> 45:46.423
At least at the University of Texas, they made rooms after people, but there's books in there.

45:46.403 --> 45:48.126
I mean, there are collections.

45:48.146 --> 45:51.752
That's how you got your name on the room down there.

45:51.772 --> 45:53.395
There's a collection that went in there.

45:53.415 --> 45:53.595
Yeah.

45:54.817 --> 46:03.532
But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, I have a real problem because there isn't, to use the expression, there isn't a homogenetic, like a community.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.076
There are all kinds of people, like, you know, Richard J. Griequist.

46:06.116 --> 46:09.762
People do question this kind of emphasis on having these specialized

46:09.978 --> 46:13.902
kind of bulking on his collection, and that's another big issue that's never been discussed.

46:14.222 --> 46:22.651
He just went ahead and chose his donors, you know, and what he wanted to have, and he said, oh, you know, wonderful, you have these special collections.

46:22.671 --> 46:37.707
I could pick something that you might like to have, you know, to contribute to, and that's how these affinity things... So-called affinity, yeah, he created, you know... I asked where that phrase came from, and he said something like somebody else.

46:38.530 --> 46:41.474
Probably down in the Affinity Collection.

46:41.935 --> 46:49.365
But it's also, they're arbitrarily designed, you know, arbitrarily developed.

46:49.726 --> 46:57.137
Basis of it is donor, is money, not really based upon where we were or where we were planning.

46:57.157 --> 47:03.626
And my concept of donor is like, there is like a Jewish, a new Jewish book center out in Massachusetts, not in your area like it.

47:03.646 --> 47:05.128
I don't know whether you're from Amherst or Amherst.

47:05.311 --> 47:12.363
Oh, okay, so I'm a member, right, yes, I'm a member.

47:12.524 --> 47:14.968
Oh, really?

47:15.289 --> 47:18.755
Okay, well I haven't read the book, I admit it.

47:19.676 --> 47:26.408
But at any rate, at any rate, when you donate there, it's, first of all,

47:26.624 --> 47:51.282
really knowing my sort of my background if you donate a lot of it is that you don't even have to have your name you donate and i know people who've donated for that to the jewish book center say you don't even have to have my name i mean i'm donating it and it's not it's not to to kind of control a collection i'm donating to the university mostly detached you know i'm doing it for for the institution you know for the group etc etc here it was

47:51.734 --> 47:59.550
People donated, and they even attacked, and this is the foundation, controlled, like, what the centers would be, where the money would go.

47:59.670 --> 48:07.506
So they have, you know, a Chevron team center, and they have the, um, Bank of America, the Fisher Children's Center, and all of that.

48:07.626 --> 48:10.772
I'd like to go take care of yourself all of them.

48:11.242 --> 48:13.365
I think the foundation would have it.

48:13.385 --> 48:17.011
All the different names, people, things, and stuff.

48:17.031 --> 48:18.994
Is this something I have to go into IT?

48:19.255 --> 48:22.360
No, the floor plan includes all the different names.

48:22.860 --> 48:23.441
Can I get that?

48:23.461 --> 48:27.087
Yeah, I'm just trying to think whether the Chevron Team Center and Bank of America.

48:27.287 --> 48:28.890
Bank of America Job Center.

48:28.950 --> 48:30.412
Bank of America Job Center.

48:30.472 --> 48:33.076
Actually, they just can 10,000.

48:33.197 --> 48:33.938
No, no.

48:33.958 --> 48:36.682
You have to be the Kodak.

48:36.922 --> 48:38.565
It's the things on film.

48:38.545 --> 48:42.671
You go to the crap thing, because we're talking about getting rid of the farmer.

48:43.032 --> 48:53.348
See, and that's what Colta doesn't like, that we're objecting to the corporatization, that's a word, of a public institution.

48:53.508 --> 48:54.470
Right, that's good.

48:55.011 --> 48:55.792
Corporatization.

48:55.852 --> 48:57.094
Corporatization.

48:57.074 --> 48:59.638
That conversation is good, exactly.

48:59.658 --> 49:01.340
I'm sure he'd agree with us.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.602
I'm sure he'd agree with us.

49:02.962 --> 49:06.087
Promo, absolutely.

49:06.668 --> 49:09.792
If you pay, you can put up a thing that will set up.

49:09.812 --> 49:11.555
And guess what?

49:12.757 --> 49:19.006
And they did The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but they never had any books down there of the novel.

49:19.186 --> 49:21.269
They never had any of them.

49:21.429 --> 49:25.495
When they produced The Hunchback of Notre Dame based upon Victor Hugo's novel.

49:25.515 --> 49:26.356
Who produced it?

49:26.376 --> 49:26.997
Disney.

49:26.977 --> 49:28.920
They were selling all over the place.

49:29.221 --> 49:35.571
Esmeralda, all the toy figures, marketing everything, but never in any of the shops did they have a novel.

49:36.412 --> 49:38.576
And I guess that's also what it boils up to.

49:38.676 --> 49:42.082
It's the marketing of the last public culture.

49:45.587 --> 49:48.512
Disney-fying.

49:49.083 --> 49:54.971
That wonderful area in Virginia, the Civil War balance.

49:55.091 --> 49:56.873
Oh, Manassas.

49:56.893 --> 50:00.057
Mickey does America.

50:00.077 --> 50:00.498
Guess what?

50:00.578 --> 50:00.959
We won.

50:01.379 --> 50:05.525
We won the war.

50:05.585 --> 50:06.446
Next case.

50:06.466 --> 50:11.172
Mickey does America.

50:11.252 --> 50:12.514
It's the Great Dumb and Down.

50:13.455 --> 50:15.698
It's the Great Dumb and Down combined with

50:15.982 --> 50:23.590
with the marketing, it was such a, you know, of a vital, lasting, vital public, truly democratic institution.

50:23.610 --> 50:25.652
And Coles would say, well, this is a democratic institution.

50:25.872 --> 50:28.214
And we say, well, yeah, this is the last great democratic.

50:28.695 --> 50:32.819
And what he talks about is not democratic control or public input, et cetera.

50:33.019 --> 50:35.121
It means that, yeah, it means that everybody can go in here.

50:35.141 --> 50:37.283
Well, everybody can go into the market, too, you know.

50:37.303 --> 50:41.888
If you let people talk for three minutes and you don't even identify what the speaker is in the minutes,

50:42.965 --> 50:45.788
This is not democratic process.

50:46.108 --> 50:53.435
Speaking of democratic process, when he had a meeting when the earthquake came, and he had a list of speakers, and I was, like, number two, and he just skipped me.

50:53.475 --> 50:55.297
And I said, excuse me, why are you skipping me?

50:55.397 --> 50:57.179
You know, people were going to sign up Coulter.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.622
And now he runs a meeting, like, you know, dictatorial, fascist.

51:01.143 --> 51:05.167
And, in fact, one of the members of the community called him, he was just a simple fascist.

51:05.527 --> 51:10.272
Now, I think that trivializes him, but he's incipient.

51:10.252 --> 51:12.755
So, just the way he runs, the controls.

51:13.475 --> 51:14.657
Both, both, both.

51:14.917 --> 51:16.318
And, you know, he needs the control.

51:16.378 --> 51:22.225
And he's very, you know, he's very smug about, he's very verbal, you know, and he can always control this.

51:22.545 --> 51:23.846
And I said, well, here's a list of people.

51:23.866 --> 51:24.867
Everybody signs up.

51:25.268 --> 51:25.808
I sign up.

51:26.369 --> 51:28.752
And he just gives me, I said, excuse me, I think I'm next on the list.

51:29.012 --> 51:30.413
He says, I prefer not to call you.

51:30.794 --> 51:31.374
I said, why?

51:31.454 --> 51:32.556
You have a list to sign up.

51:32.896 --> 51:35.138
He said, I don't want to hear from staff.

51:35.158 --> 51:36.600
Quote, I don't want to hear from staff.

51:37.060 --> 51:38.622
I want to hear the public.

51:38.787 --> 51:42.192
And I think even someone from the public was going to cede me her space.

51:42.592 --> 51:45.336
And he said, no, I've decided that I don't want to hear from staff.

51:45.396 --> 51:51.544
What he said, and I will put this to you, because I'm just telling you something else.

51:51.564 --> 51:57.232
And I mentioned all the backlog of books and all that.

51:57.252 --> 52:00.937
And he suggested it was sabotage from the part of staff.

52:00.977 --> 52:01.939
Because of the book?

52:02.019 --> 52:05.824
Yeah, because of staff.

52:05.804 --> 52:10.539
staffing or concern about staffing, hiring shelters as opposed to pagers.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.803
They started that.

52:12.024 --> 52:12.867
He started it.

52:12.907 --> 52:14.151
They started it.

52:14.231 --> 52:15.696
And he said that.

52:16.165 --> 52:18.249
My sentence is, I can't prove it.

52:18.269 --> 52:23.798
He says, but I would be surprised if there was the staff deliberately doing that to make it look bad.

52:23.818 --> 52:24.579
No.

52:24.619 --> 52:28.926
What happened is, yes, that's... Could we tell him that... But what I'm saying is he suggested that.

52:29.027 --> 52:29.287
Yeah.

52:29.588 --> 52:36.639
But what I would suggest is that this whole shelver versus page business, crossing the backlog... Which Gina said there will be those shelvers.

52:37.361 --> 52:38.142
Which she what?

52:38.162 --> 52:40.306
She said today there will be those shelvers.

52:40.326 --> 52:41.568
There will be pages.

52:41.648 --> 52:41.768
Right.

52:42.322 --> 52:48.852
I asked her about that this morning, you know, whether we're going to have this new prep category.

52:49.032 --> 52:49.413
She said no.

52:49.573 --> 52:50.415
No, no, no.

52:50.495 --> 52:56.464
There was money in the budget, last year's budget, for $150,000.

52:57.446 --> 52:58.407
Because they had money.

52:58.387 --> 53:00.691
Who are these pages?

53:00.751 --> 53:01.852
New Yorkers.

53:02.073 --> 53:06.620
All they wanted to do was create a new tier system from the very beginning.

53:06.640 --> 53:10.205
And they said, where is that money that was always earmarked for the pages?

53:10.285 --> 53:11.727
It's there, it's there.

53:11.768 --> 53:13.791
And finally, why aren't we hiring?

53:14.151 --> 53:14.772
It's been good.

53:14.832 --> 53:15.633
It's been used.

53:15.734 --> 53:16.314
It's been used.

53:16.335 --> 53:17.596
And it wasn't Coulter who said that.

53:17.636 --> 53:19.680
It was David Price who is no longer with us.

53:19.740 --> 53:21.182
He's in West Virginia now.

53:21.522 --> 53:26.470
But he said that when we were in a labor management meeting arguing for it,

53:26.720 --> 53:37.655
to protect the library pages, to continue to do the work they always had been done at the same rate of pay, but because they wanted to spend the money on other things other than personnel.

53:38.316 --> 53:38.836
They had to.

53:38.997 --> 53:40.158
Do you know what they had?

53:40.178 --> 53:41.500
$92,000.

53:42.221 --> 53:43.783
Just for bulbs, not for labor.

53:43.803 --> 53:47.368
$92,000 for every, was it a year?

53:47.388 --> 53:50.092
$92,000, not including labor.

53:50.112 --> 53:50.893
Not including labor.

53:50.913 --> 53:51.614
Take care of the lighting.

53:51.634 --> 53:52.575
Take care of the lighting.

53:52.795 --> 53:54.718
I never knew that.

53:54.698 --> 53:56.700
That's not the electrical process.

53:56.780 --> 53:57.641
Just the light bulbs.

53:57.661 --> 53:58.341
Just the light bulbs.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.082
Replacing the bulbs.

53:59.122 --> 53:59.783
Replacing the bulbs.

53:59.803 --> 54:00.884
Replacing all the lighting.

54:01.004 --> 54:01.625
Right.

54:01.645 --> 54:02.906
Not the cause of electricity.

54:02.926 --> 54:03.186
Right.

54:03.306 --> 54:04.067
Right.

54:04.087 --> 54:07.730
So, and at any rate, see, this is the basic distress.

54:07.830 --> 54:11.834
So this man should not be part of the commission where he thinks that staff is out to set.

54:12.155 --> 54:15.638
How many times have he told him that they wouldn't listen?

54:15.658 --> 54:17.119
At meetings, there isn't any room.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.901
Where is your staffing pattern?

54:18.921 --> 54:23.085
The way you have the same, there isn't enough room for what we have, plus growth.

54:23.622 --> 54:32.232
But the problem is also that we met with them in good faith, and time after time after time, they lied to us, and they stole them.

54:32.465 --> 54:38.392
We took that money out and they used it for something else other than the people who were supposed to be hired.

54:38.412 --> 54:39.894
People who were supposed to be hired for that money.

54:39.914 --> 54:40.995
So they did that deliberately.

54:41.336 --> 54:42.137
And we pushed that.

54:42.377 --> 54:54.332
And how many times did we sit, I mean, I was telling Andrea and some other people, remember how four years ago I asked what was, I mean, meeting after meeting after meeting, I asked, what is a staffing plan?

54:54.352 --> 54:57.395
Do you have a staffing plan for the library, et cetera?

54:57.415 --> 54:58.897
And when you get up, they roll their eyes.

54:59.238 --> 54:59.738
They don't even listen.

54:59.758 --> 55:01.240
They don't even talk about the issues.

55:01.692 --> 55:02.874
So it's as though here we are.

55:02.914 --> 55:10.965
This is the kind of scenario is where the token opposition, so it doesn't matter what we say, we're just going to get up at a point.

55:10.985 --> 55:12.527
You never discuss the content.

55:12.547 --> 55:14.130
Again, content doesn't matter.

55:14.170 --> 55:15.151
You never discuss the content.

55:15.191 --> 55:19.938
But it was always, as far as a lot of us are concerned, it was always planned to go this way.

55:20.279 --> 55:24.164
So no matter what opposition, no matter who brought up any questions, they were going to assure you.

55:24.184 --> 55:27.649
I mean, he doesn't understand that the, or they don't understand the concept of consensus.

55:27.815 --> 55:36.385
means you come to something that everybody, there are differences of opinion, doesn't make one right, one wrong, but you come to a consensus of what everybody can live with.

55:36.405 --> 55:37.186
That's the process.

55:37.827 --> 55:42.853
But no, you know, the plan had been established, and it was to have this monument.

55:43.794 --> 55:53.265
And I think that line, I don't know whether Andrea gave me that line from the Samson of the Bay Guardian, it's kind of a mind-numbing monument to

55:53.583 --> 55:58.192
It's a wonderful line.

55:58.252 --> 56:01.478
It sums it up closely.

56:01.598 --> 56:05.686
Oh, I get it.

56:05.766 --> 56:10.215
It's in the Bay Guardian from last week.

56:10.235 --> 56:12.679
Can you write that down?

56:12.699 --> 56:16.266
San Francisco Bay Guardian.

56:16.246 --> 56:18.349
A library that was disastrously, yeah.

56:19.330 --> 56:25.738
A mind-numbing, a mind-numbing, sterile technology, sterile technology before books.

56:26.318 --> 56:28.581
A mind-numbing monument, right.

56:29.102 --> 56:30.283
Who wrote this?

56:30.384 --> 56:31.104
Ron Perrin.

56:31.144 --> 56:31.645
A reporter.

56:32.026 --> 56:33.027
C-U-R-R-A-N.

56:33.327 --> 56:33.467
Right.

56:34.449 --> 56:40.336
A mind-numbing monument to sterile technology before books.

56:40.356 --> 56:41.137
Technology before books?

56:41.157 --> 56:42.599
Before books, you know.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.342
And also, disastrously,

56:45.811 --> 56:49.016
planned, and when it says disastrously planned.

56:49.617 --> 56:52.761
He's the Bay Guardian, one of the Bay Guardian reporters.

56:52.781 --> 56:59.411
He is very interested in doing stories on the library, and also not only because he's interested, but because he's a library user.

56:59.471 --> 57:02.255
He's a library user, and he says, he can't stand coming in here.

57:02.275 --> 57:05.219
And that makes me feel sad, too, because then we miss out.

57:05.239 --> 57:06.181
I miss out.

57:06.461 --> 57:10.907
We really like working with these people, and I miss seeing all our regulars.

57:10.927 --> 57:15.514
And what's happened is the library has deterred, as they were saying, again, coming back to the serious reader.

57:15.494 --> 57:18.478
And the Tilly Olsen can't stand coming to this place anymore.

57:18.498 --> 57:20.100
Well, people have actually given up.

57:20.761 --> 57:24.606
I mean, people come, and it really is such a deterrent.

57:25.207 --> 57:27.711
It really is a deterrent to the serious reader.

57:28.191 --> 57:31.355
The collections have been so diluted by it.

57:31.375 --> 57:32.457
It's difficult to use.

57:32.918 --> 57:35.241
It's noisy.

57:35.521 --> 57:40.948
It's not a refuge anymore for quiet, for study, for research.

57:41.970 --> 57:44.353
It's noisy, ill-planned.

57:45.397 --> 57:47.240
Material books aren't available.

57:48.181 --> 57:50.084
They're dispersed widely dispersed.

57:50.124 --> 57:53.209
Let me see if I can contact the architect.

57:54.771 --> 57:54.892
Ooh.

57:54.912 --> 57:55.953
See if she's going to be around.

57:56.194 --> 57:56.734
Which one?

57:56.794 --> 57:58.377
Kathy Simon.

57:58.557 --> 58:01.502
Kathy Simon, Martin, Winklestein, Dave Morris.

58:01.522 --> 58:02.483
Oh, I think I said it right.

58:02.503 --> 58:03.084
Oh, good for you.

58:03.725 --> 58:06.009
I just barely remember her name.

58:06.069 --> 58:08.432
But she's the one who signed it, right?

58:08.553 --> 58:08.873
Yeah.

58:09.055 --> 58:12.389
internal structure she designed over.

58:12.629 --> 58:15.762
James Hingofre designed the... I am here.

58:16.324 --> 58:17.128
No.

58:17.148 --> 58:19.437
It's my implicit as I am Pei.

58:20.075 --> 58:25.464
Yeah, remember the disastrous John Hancock Building?

58:25.504 --> 58:27.146
Well, he called it the Flywood Building.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.789
Well, he did the Holocaust with him, too.

58:28.869 --> 58:30.412
Do you know why they called it the Flywood Building?

58:30.432 --> 58:31.794
Because the windows kept popping out.

58:33.256 --> 58:34.879
Killing people!

58:34.979 --> 58:42.471
I don't know if they actually killed people.

58:42.687 --> 58:47.874
And this is another fixation that library architects have, that they need atriums.

58:48.595 --> 58:50.879
This place is so noisy.

58:50.899 --> 58:59.571
The noise rises from the bottom up to our floor and the fourth floor, that after an hour, librarians are suffering.

58:59.651 --> 59:02.796
We feel we have to get off the desk because we feel like we're just getting polluted.

59:03.316 --> 59:09.505
It is such an incessant noise that it is such a deterrent, actually, to anyone, even

59:09.772 --> 59:11.714
doing any quiet type of study.

59:11.734 --> 59:14.257
Now, they have these special rooms of the din.

59:14.277 --> 59:14.417
Yeah.

59:14.457 --> 59:15.118
The din.

59:15.378 --> 59:16.439
It's a din.

59:16.600 --> 59:19.563
She said, quiet is gone.

59:19.583 --> 59:20.304
That's right.

59:20.384 --> 59:20.724
Exactly.

59:20.744 --> 59:21.365
Quiet is gone.

59:21.385 --> 59:24.328
But it's a disturbing din.

59:24.468 --> 59:27.712
I feel it's a refuge, right?

59:28.172 --> 59:29.714
Address yourself to your readings.

59:29.774 --> 59:36.261
The only refuge around here is the last refuge of the scoundrels.

59:36.481 --> 59:38.223
The last refuge of the scoundrels.

59:38.424 --> 59:39.745
It's a refuge.

59:39.725 --> 59:41.768
Okay.

59:41.788 --> 59:45.093
Who else should I see?

59:46.114 --> 59:51.482
Well, I kind of thought, I already alerted a couple of staff members.

59:51.542 --> 59:59.033
I could take you up to the... take you around and maybe...

59:59.941 --> 01:00:07.793
This is a result, really, of one person's so-called vision, and it is not representing... He always talks about we.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.235
It's really him.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:13.562
It does not represent the vision, quote-unquote, of librarians.

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:27.062
And way back in the earthquake time, when I said, you know, at this point, I really think what he had planned, the reorganization of the old name, was a poor idea, and I was quoted in the papers,

01:00:27.532 --> 01:00:37.221
that I was transferred out of the main because I did not agree with, and this is a quote from the assistant city librarian, because I didn't agree with the organizational library.
