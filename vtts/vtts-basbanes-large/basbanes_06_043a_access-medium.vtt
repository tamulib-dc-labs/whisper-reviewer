WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:04.464
Talking to Owen Gingrich, Harvard.

00:05.385 --> 00:14.555
Let's talk before we get on about Haven O'Moore, because I'm really excited, and I don't want you to think that I'm here to talk principally about Haven O'Moore.

00:14.615 --> 00:25.006
I certainly want to talk to you about him if you want to talk to me about him, but I am really excited about what you've been doing with the practice, and I was going through the census here.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.249
By the way, you will be publishing a census, I gather,

00:28.448 --> 00:36.239
Yes, this is all machine-readable copy you're looking at, and I am in the process of converting it into camera-ready copy.

00:37.601 --> 00:47.014
This was just very much a trial where nowhere close to getting it into

00:47.450 --> 00:54.459
book form yet, but there will be about 550 copies of the book described, both the first and second edition.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.666
All of them, with this complete provenance, says it has been possible to establish.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.228
And who will be publishing the book?

01:01.248 --> 01:09.980
It will be published by Brill and Leiden, because they are the publishers of the Studia Kopernikana series of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

01:10.420 --> 01:15.347
And because of the support, I've had very helpful

01:15.682 --> 01:22.670
collaboration with their scholars, I agreed I would publish it in their series, providing there would be a Western publisher.

01:23.151 --> 01:29.999
And now that they have, I mean, the Eastern Bloc has sort of broken loose, they can go out and be capitalists and get Brill to do it for them.

01:32.061 --> 01:35.705
Could you just say what you mean by censorship?

01:36.366 --> 01:41.672
Did they in fact, did owners at some point censor material out of the book?

01:41.693 --> 01:45.537
This was a very specific project of the

01:45.922 --> 01:49.767
Catholic Index of Prohibited Books.

01:52.270 --> 01:57.476
You will see here in the book, this is the index of prohibited books.

01:57.496 --> 02:03.743
Have you ever seen an index before?

02:03.843 --> 02:07.007
The index of prohibited books gets printed over and over and over again.

02:07.468 --> 02:10.371
Most of them are rather small, more or less pocket-sized ones.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.673
This is a rather handsome one.

02:12.013 --> 02:14.376
This is published in 1664, so it's

02:14.660 --> 02:21.488
sufficiently later that it has everything re-alphabetized.

02:21.868 --> 02:32.560
If you want to find out about Copernicus, you don't look under C. You find it here under N. Nicholas Copernicus, De revolutionibus orbium, unless corrected.

02:33.762 --> 02:37.026
It goes on the index in the decree of 1616.

02:37.486 --> 02:41.190
It is permitted if it's corrected according to the decree of 1620.

02:41.811 --> 02:43.553
So the decree of 1620

02:43.803 --> 02:52.513
is here in the back of the book, and we'll have to find it.

02:53.054 --> 02:54.375
It's in pretty nice shape.

02:54.395 --> 02:57.038
Oh, these early books aren't on brittle paper.

02:57.639 --> 03:05.308
Now, the important thing to understand, I think, is that this is extremely unusual.

03:05.709 --> 03:09.473
It is the only book for which the

03:09.993 --> 03:16.462
Holy Congregation actually spelled out how it was to be censored.

03:16.823 --> 03:22.430
Now, in most copies, or many books, it says, permitted if corrected.

03:22.931 --> 03:25.034
But they don't bother to say what the corrections are.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.816
I guess they think it's obvious.

03:27.978 --> 03:36.089
But Copernicus's book is so unusual because they decided they couldn't take out the heliocentrism.

03:36.109 --> 03:37.992
All they could do is to make the book appear

03:38.275 --> 03:40.117
more hypothetical.

03:40.618 --> 03:51.210
So there are 10 or a dozen specific places where you're supposed to cross off text and add new text or else simply cross off the text or change a chapter heading.

03:51.371 --> 03:55.996
Cross off by 10 or actually physically exercise the expensive material?

03:56.116 --> 04:01.483
Did you look at all of this other article that was... I read that article.

04:01.503 --> 04:03.445
In fact, I'm going to see if I can call it.

04:03.465 --> 04:07.810
That's going to be in my other anthology called

04:08.093 --> 04:15.880
the Eye of Heaven, and that's what I'm just now working on.

04:15.900 --> 04:27.029
Well, here you can see an example of a censored copy in which, in this particular case, is Galileo's, and he didn't cross out anything very heavily, so he can still read it.

04:27.670 --> 04:35.437
Sometimes it's crossed out so heavily that the paper falls out, because the gallic acid in the ink keeps right through.

04:36.217 --> 04:37.138
Sometimes,

04:37.422 --> 04:44.608
It's little strips of paper pasted over it, in which case the bookworms love that toothpaste.

04:45.169 --> 04:53.096
And sometimes the worms have done what the owners didn't intend, which is to have the text on the backside destroyed by the worms going through.

04:54.117 --> 04:57.620
Okay, so, and here's the map.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.701
I've just redone this.

04:58.781 --> 05:01.644
I just took it over to the artist this morning.

05:02.765 --> 05:06.568
This shows where the copies were in 1620.

05:07.342 --> 05:10.865
And that is possible because you've seen all the provenances.

05:11.806 --> 05:14.429
So the black ones are the censored ones.

05:14.449 --> 05:18.373
So you can see they were not effective in Spain.

05:18.693 --> 05:23.017
And in the new one, I've just drawn their copies here and here, which are not censored.

05:23.077 --> 05:25.680
I have added a number of additional copies for Spain.

05:26.701 --> 05:32.246
It was seen very much as a local Italian imbroglio.

05:32.266 --> 05:37.011
But you can tell instantly, and looking at a copy, whether it's censored or not censored.

05:37.463 --> 05:40.688
And therefore, if it's an Italian copy, probably.

05:40.868 --> 05:44.274
No, no, no, it's always censored in Latin.

05:44.294 --> 05:44.414
I see.

05:44.434 --> 05:45.696
Yeah, because the book's in Latin.

05:45.796 --> 05:48.881
But I mean, had it been owned in Italy, is that just what I'm saying?

05:48.961 --> 05:51.465
Had it been owned in Italy, it's still censored in Latin.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.607
Okay.

05:52.627 --> 05:54.911
But I mean, was it Italian-owned is what I'm saying?

05:54.931 --> 05:56.313
Yeah, that's right.

05:57.034 --> 06:00.880
I mean, and almost all those censored copies were Italian-owned.

06:00.900 --> 06:05.327
Now, of course, the continual stirring of books by the sale and resale of them

06:05.645 --> 06:09.488
and put censored copies in Sweden and England and the U.S.

06:09.648 --> 06:10.549
and so on.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.171
That's just how books travel around.

06:13.632 --> 06:22.319
Explain to me, and I know it's written, but explain to me why this census is so important to you.

06:22.399 --> 06:25.722
It's got to be more than an exercise to find every copy.

06:25.742 --> 06:25.882
Oh.

06:29.466 --> 06:34.690
I first found a wonderfully annotated copy in...

06:35.277 --> 06:41.507
Edinburgh, which was done by the leading teacher in the generation after Copernicus.

06:42.169 --> 06:49.341
And I thought to myself, that's interesting to see how this material was being taught in 1550.

06:49.541 --> 06:52.887
I wonder what I'll find by looking at other copies.

06:53.968 --> 07:00.880
And I started looking at other copies and making very rudimentary notes, either it's annotated or it's not annotated.

07:01.417 --> 07:09.946
But as I got into it, I realized that there was a lot of interesting information to be had by looking at the provenances because you could see what the book history was.

07:10.706 --> 07:21.017
So I started all over again and went back to the places and got much better handle on everything that was written in the book that gave indication of where it had been.

07:21.097 --> 07:25.922
Then I had got up to 100.

07:26.408 --> 07:28.470
Did you have it personally handled, by the way?

07:28.710 --> 07:29.411
That's right.

07:29.471 --> 07:32.854
Identified in... A hundred first editions.

07:32.874 --> 07:35.497
And I figured, well, I've got enough statistics.

07:35.897 --> 07:37.338
This is a good stopping point.

07:37.739 --> 07:38.740
But I was in Rome.

07:39.300 --> 07:44.305
It was 1973, the quinquicentennial year for Copernicus.

07:45.066 --> 07:50.231
And there were more books in Rome than any other place where I hadn't looked.

07:50.251 --> 07:52.793
And I thought, well, this is too good an opportunity.

07:52.813 --> 07:55.656
I went to the Vatican Library and...

07:57.020 --> 08:21.734
this incident is described in the piece in the Great Copernicus Chase Anthology, that I went in and found that it was, here was another wonderfully annotated copy, and that it was obvious that it had been copied from Erasmus Reinhold's copy, which was that first one I had seen in Edinburgh.

08:22.816 --> 08:25.980
And then,

08:26.348 --> 08:39.587
Very shortly after that, I mean, within a matter of a couple of days, I discovered that the hand in it was exactly the same as in the copy that was attributed to Tycho Brahe, which is in Prague.

08:40.287 --> 08:46.216
So I began to understand for the first time that a person might own more than one copy.

08:47.417 --> 08:52.845
It took a lot of work and a number of years to show that what had been

08:53.213 --> 09:14.140
believed to be Tico's copy for many decades was, in fact, not his handwriting, but belonged to a very obscure itinerant scholar who never published anything, who therefore nearly perished, named Paul Vidic, and that he had not one but four copies.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.002
Wow.

09:16.022 --> 09:21.229
And then it became much more of a game when it was clear

09:21.513 --> 09:44.638
that the annotations were copied from one book to another to be as complete as possible, because you never could tell what was lurking in those few that you hadn't looked at yet in terms of connections between what was there.

09:46.561 --> 09:51.486
For instance, in the famous Corblet O'Moore copy,

09:51.888 --> 09:54.271
of the Copernicus.

09:54.291 --> 09:58.897
There is a long Greek poem written in the beginning of it.

09:58.917 --> 10:10.231
And so in the course of the researches, I had been to Parma in Italy, and I had asked to see the copy there, and they couldn't find it.

10:11.032 --> 10:16.578
They not only couldn't find it, but they showed me the hole on the shelf where it was supposed to be filed.

10:16.598 --> 10:19.482
So I thought, hmm, that's interesting.

10:20.525 --> 10:26.591
My colleague then told me, oh, that was missing over a year ago when I tried to find it.

10:27.712 --> 10:29.073
And I thought, that's interesting.

10:29.093 --> 10:34.498
And I remembered that in the card catalog there had been something special about it.

10:34.518 --> 10:40.604
And it said this is prefixed with a Greek poem written by Camerarius.

10:40.624 --> 10:48.591
So I thought, uh-oh, this is very suspicious that this book has appeared on the market sometime after World War II.

10:48.925 --> 10:52.289
Maybe a hungry librarian sold it or something.

10:52.809 --> 10:58.175
So I wrote to Parma to ask them how long it had been missing and so on.

10:59.116 --> 11:04.561
And I got back the letter in Italian and I showed it to one of my colleagues here, an astronomer from Italy.

11:05.102 --> 11:07.564
He looked at me and said, this isn't written in Italian.

11:07.985 --> 11:09.446
This is written in legalese.

11:11.108 --> 11:18.696
And he said it was the most, you know, guarded kind of letter to protect the flying from

11:19.250 --> 11:21.513
from Parma.

11:21.533 --> 11:24.497
So... I bet you went into a lot of this when you've gone along.

11:24.517 --> 11:24.998
Oh, yes.

11:25.519 --> 11:48.210
Well, I asked, then the book by that time belonged to Haven or more, so I asked Haven if I could see the book, and he brought it in, and we went down to a closet that we could make absolutely black, and I turned my ultraviolet light on it and scanned the whole thing to see if there was any evidence of a book plate removed, a signature removed, anything.

11:48.747 --> 11:53.453
And there was just absolutely no ownership marks from Parma at all in the book.

11:53.473 --> 12:00.020
And I was very, very puzzled because it just seemed to me such an open-and-check case that this had come from Parma.

12:00.681 --> 12:18.062
And this whole episode taught me a very interesting lesson because a few years later, a European bookseller called me to say that he was on to a very interesting copy of Copernicus and he'd like to talk to me about it.

12:18.768 --> 12:30.679
So I went to see him, and he showed me Xeroxes of, guess what, a poem in Greek in the hand of Camerarius in a copy of the book that I had never seen and I have never seen.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.001
He said, this is very odd.

12:33.021 --> 12:42.129
He said, I got a telephone call long distance from a party that couldn't be traced asking me if I would be interested in certain books, and I said I was.

12:42.990 --> 12:48.235
And so the next thing that arrived was this pack of Xeroxes, including this one.

12:48.822 --> 12:57.573
He said, frankly, this is the only really interesting book in the lot, and from what you tell me, he said, it's undoubtedly the copy stolen from Parma.

12:57.593 --> 13:02.760
He says the problem was there was no return address on the package that you could use to trace back.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.642
And then they never got in touch again?

13:04.682 --> 13:08.067
As far as I know, they never got in touch again.

13:08.087 --> 13:08.948
They must have been scared.

13:08.968 --> 13:15.336
They must have been scared, and what I'm afraid is that they will cut that page out before they try to sell it.

13:16.970 --> 13:26.698
Before we went on the tape, you had said that the Horvillet, O'Moore, and Alexander and Copernicus is the most important copy of Private Hands.

13:27.018 --> 13:30.822
And could you... You can basically read that in the Garden Limited Sale catalog.

13:32.123 --> 13:32.243
Right.

13:32.263 --> 13:35.245
But for reasons stated, those are the reasons in the Garden catalog.

13:35.285 --> 13:38.288
That's why... I wrote this description in this... Oh, you did?

13:38.368 --> 13:39.149
...in the catalog.

13:39.669 --> 13:41.290
It was very... How did that happen?

13:41.310 --> 13:42.732
The self-defense contract?

13:42.772 --> 13:43.672
Do you want to ask the decision?

13:43.692 --> 13:43.873
Sure.

13:45.053 --> 13:46.875
I wrote a couple of the descriptions here.

13:47.547 --> 13:55.259
But Haven O'Moore was very sensitive about it.

13:55.419 --> 14:04.593
I never saw him during this process, but it was plain that he was looking at all of the text on a very regular basis.

14:05.194 --> 14:05.955
Of the catalog?

14:06.095 --> 14:06.837
Of the catalog.

14:07.177 --> 14:11.203
They got back to me and they said, wouldn't you please say such and such?

14:11.223 --> 14:13.707
And I would say, no, you know, that's not honest.

14:14.108 --> 14:20.334
I said I would help you, you know, if you then don't rewrite the copy.

14:20.615 --> 14:28.443
So Haven was always, as he was, whenever I saw him, always keen to make his copy the very best.

14:28.923 --> 14:32.127
He wanted his to be the only four-star copy.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.469
Wouldn't I please make it a four-star copy?

14:34.489 --> 14:35.250
Who were you dealing with?

14:35.290 --> 14:36.912
Jay Dillon itself used probably?

14:36.932 --> 14:38.633
Yeah, among others, basically.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.016
Very interesting.

14:41.116 --> 14:43.238
So there was this continual feedback.

14:43.606 --> 15:01.396
And we finally got it tuned in a way that I was satisfied that they hadn't perjured themselves, and that Avon was satisfied that the copy came out strong enough.

15:01.537 --> 15:03.680
It's not signed, though.

15:03.740 --> 15:07.707
I don't think it's signed, no.

15:08.362 --> 15:09.945
that they went upside down?

15:10.465 --> 15:15.593
Oh, I think they did on... Sure, that makes perfect sense.

15:15.634 --> 15:18.979
Probably on a number of the books.

15:18.999 --> 15:32.601
But I did both the narratio prima and this, and I think in both cases it actually says that they thanked me for doing it.

15:33.883 --> 15:34.183
Okay.

15:35.446 --> 15:36.227
Now, let's see.

15:36.287 --> 15:38.990
These are in order of date, I believe.

15:39.111 --> 15:42.575
That's okay.

15:42.595 --> 15:42.955
I'll look this up.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.097
There's the Copernicus.

15:44.117 --> 15:44.357
Wow.

15:45.038 --> 15:47.041
Is that the original binding, by the way?

15:47.181 --> 15:58.195
See, we are grateful to Professor Owen Gingrich's generous assistance with this description and for his permission to quote from his translation of the autographed poem of Camerarius.

15:58.215 --> 16:01.539
So... Yeah, yeah.

16:01.559 --> 16:02.500
That's original.

16:03.577 --> 16:08.904
Yeah, yeah, blind-stamped pigskin.

16:09.004 --> 16:18.337
And, of course, what I found inside was something here that starts out with CO under the ultraviolet.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.879
Haven was very excited.

16:19.899 --> 16:24.705
He wanted me to make it say Copernicus, as if Copernicus would have written his name in it.

16:24.725 --> 16:33.297
But there was no way this could have been because Copernicus died, essentially, on the day that they

16:33.547 --> 16:35.129
final pages arrived.

16:35.469 --> 16:37.932
Did these urchings abuse you?

16:40.014 --> 16:49.984
Well, I sort of let them flow off like water off a duck's back, but I could see what he was up to.

16:50.385 --> 16:55.590
What was his reaction about the prospect of losing these books?

16:55.690 --> 16:57.792
Did he show anything?

16:57.813 --> 17:00.195
Well, obviously he was upset about it.

17:00.293 --> 17:03.558
I didn't, but I didn't talk to him in this final stage.

17:04.158 --> 17:05.861
Nobody else, not many people did, actually.

17:06.081 --> 17:09.446
But he was obviously in close connection with them there.

17:09.466 --> 17:15.755
You see, here they published my census of the copies, and again, they say thanks.

17:15.795 --> 17:20.642
I looked at some of the other descriptions, too, but I didn't work on them that heavily.

17:23.806 --> 17:28.613
Let's go back to the earlier narrative that we were developing here.

17:29.032 --> 17:54.972
Well, anyway, even to the last moment, in the sense that interesting things have turned up as a result of continuing to pursue it, so that one of the final copies I've managed to see in bringing it to an end in the Lennon State Library, I had been stonewalled about for

17:56.200 --> 17:58.624
for many years in seeing this copy.

17:58.764 --> 18:01.368
There was always some excuse or another why I couldn't see it.

18:01.888 --> 18:03.851
They told me it was in conservation.

18:04.532 --> 18:11.362
And when I finally saw it, January a year ago, I realized that it had never needed conservation and never been in conservation.

18:11.963 --> 18:23.760
So I asked them bluntly what was going on, and they said the Lennon State Library has hundreds of clandestine books taken from Germany at the end of World War II.

18:24.584 --> 18:26.086
They're in a kind of gray area.

18:26.226 --> 18:28.229
In one sense, they're war reparations.

18:28.829 --> 18:32.434
In another sense, by the Geneva Conventions, they're cultural artifacts.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.040
And they just didn't want foreigners messing around.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.463
You have no idea what's in there, then?

18:40.344 --> 18:48.955
No, but we know they must have backed up a truck to the Leopoldina, famous Natural History Academy in Halle, in East Germany, and just taken the whole library.

18:51.179 --> 18:55.483
And I said earlier that you can't tell about books missing from Berlin.

18:56.564 --> 19:10.158
The copy in the Berlin State Library was missing, and I assumed it had been destroyed in the bombings and the destruction at the very end of the war.

19:11.059 --> 19:19.667
But I finally decided, okay, since we know a little bit about this book, I'll include it in the census because it has a provenance.

19:20.052 --> 19:21.474
even though it's been destroyed.

19:22.155 --> 19:25.820
So there was a name inside it.

19:26.721 --> 19:35.813
And as is my custom in making the fences, I look up all the previous owners to find out where they were.

19:36.233 --> 19:44.184
And this was Heinrich Hoffmann, Johann Heinrich Hoffmann.

19:44.204 --> 19:45.165
And I looked him up.

19:45.618 --> 19:58.213
in biographical sources, and it had an astonishing familiar ring to it, and I said, wait a minute, this book from Berlin is someplace else in the census.

19:58.233 --> 20:11.389
And it took a while to find it, and you'll notice, and my notes were very interesting, because I had, and the original notes had written,

20:11.690 --> 20:18.600
there is this repair in the center of the title page which looks as if it has been done to conceal an earlier ownership.

20:19.322 --> 20:20.283
And in fact, it was.

20:20.383 --> 20:21.745
They had removed the book plate.

20:22.226 --> 20:29.837
So maybe when they told me this other book had to be in conservation, they meant they hadn't yet had a chance to eliminate all the early marks.

20:29.857 --> 20:32.922
I have a chapter on book sets, by the way, and this is very useful.

20:33.745 --> 20:34.586
this will get in there.

20:34.846 --> 20:39.391
I'm not going to tell you all the rest of my booksept stories today.

20:39.411 --> 20:45.237
I've got to save some of them for my other books that I've been involved with, Interpol, and so on.

20:45.618 --> 20:47.300
Did this become an obsession with you?

20:48.261 --> 20:53.006
Oh, it's obviously Don Quixote Plus.

20:53.086 --> 21:03.617
I mean, I've been tilting at this particular windmill in a way that I really want to see all possible copies so that I wouldn't have

21:03.985 --> 21:14.938
I probably wouldn't have taken that trip to Moscow just to see a single book, except I knew it was very well annotated, and I really wanted to know where it fit in the scheme of things.

21:15.058 --> 21:19.584
Why is it important that you personally handle every book?

21:21.286 --> 21:27.393
Well, to begin with, most librarians can't read them, can't read the writing.

21:27.934 --> 21:32.760
It is so many different hands, and there are so many different clues that one can

21:32.960 --> 21:36.344
can pick up by looking at the book directly.

21:36.764 --> 21:41.610
And librarians will look at a book rather casually and tell you, no, it's not annotated.

21:42.110 --> 21:48.657
And you go and look at it, and you find that if you're very careful and turn every page, there are interesting things written there.

21:48.677 --> 21:56.766
So that in many, many cases, I could have accomplished the same thing just by asking them all to each to send me a microfilm.

21:56.786 --> 22:00.030
Not every place is prepared to make a microfilm.

22:00.297 --> 22:04.742
One of the very interesting copies, from my point of view, is in Soissons in France.

22:05.503 --> 22:10.789
And I asked, when I saw the annotations, I said I need to have copies of these.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.352
They said, we're a small place.

22:13.452 --> 22:16.296
We have no possibility in this town to get it microfilmed.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.999
If you want to take your own pictures, why don't you do it?

22:19.920 --> 22:27.649
So I had color film in the camera, so I essentially did a microfilm on color slides.

22:27.849 --> 22:29.511
And I'm sorry I don't have more of them.

22:29.828 --> 22:39.800
now that I come back to look at the book, because it turns out to be one of five or six copies that have the same set of annotations.

22:40.161 --> 22:52.096
And it wasn't until last month when my colleague Doug Jitsky was here that we thought about it and worked on it hard enough to finally figure out how come there were these six copies.

22:52.116 --> 22:58.063
They come from another little-known guy who is apparently a tutor and

22:58.499 --> 23:03.844
It was basically operating out of Paris in the 1550s.

23:04.685 --> 23:13.995
Why is one book worth all this work, all this energy, all this travel, all this scholarship that you've created?

23:14.015 --> 23:25.907
Well, it's the first time anybody's really done this for any book at all, to show what the book movements have been, the pattern of losses of books, what the survival is of

23:26.258 --> 23:27.739
You'll get a lot of information.

23:27.800 --> 23:32.204
It feeds back, enables us to estimate how big the edition was.

23:32.885 --> 23:43.515
A lot of interesting information comes out very indirectly on the interaction between Copernicus and the printer, which was located at quite a distance from him.

23:46.018 --> 23:51.803
We find out basically how the book was being studied.

23:51.823 --> 23:54.426
We found out that it was

23:54.963 --> 23:57.365
really quite extensively studied.

23:57.386 --> 24:01.570
I think I'm going to call my other book the book nobody read.

24:01.610 --> 24:04.853
Well, you call it Arthur Kessler, right?

24:05.414 --> 24:13.943
Because of, it's coming from Arthur Kessler, who has branded it the book that nobody read, and it took about 10 years to prove that he was completely wrong.

24:15.304 --> 24:20.970
Is that, is that quote, is that statement of his, is that one of the catalysts?

24:21.170 --> 24:22.371
No, not really.

24:22.511 --> 24:30.560
It was just that in the process of doing this, I suddenly realized that I had rather demolished that particular statement.

24:30.580 --> 24:37.528
Do you think that was a rather arrogant statement, or just an uninformed?

24:37.548 --> 24:46.418
There was no way he could have been better informed about it at the time, but he, in many instances, somewhat overgeneralized.

24:46.938 --> 24:48.880
And how did you start with this book?

24:49.140 --> 25:15.865
I mean, you gave me the description earlier about what started the census, but yourself... It was in part because in 1973 was the quinquin centennial, and I was, at that point, beginning to get heavily involved in the history of astronomy, and I knew with a big celebration like that, everybody would expect talks and lectures and so on, and I was wondering, you know, what could there be a need to say?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.585
Copernicus has been studied for centuries.

25:19.467 --> 25:25.355
And suddenly I realized that here was a niche that nobody else had taken up at all.

25:25.415 --> 25:36.230
The result of all this was that I have become an expert about a particular book in a way that hardly anybody else ever has.

25:37.212 --> 25:45.143
There is, of course, an old and quite out of date census of the first folios of Shakespeare.

25:45.865 --> 25:48.128
The Gutenberg Bibles, the Bayes Sound Book.

25:48.628 --> 25:51.191
Of course, there are only 11 Bayes Sound Books.

25:51.211 --> 25:58.139
There is the Elephant Folio of John James Audit, which was too easy because there was a list of subscribers printed in it.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.662
That's exactly right.

26:00.682 --> 26:12.415
But the Bayes Sound Book, there were only 11, and six of them came from Thomas Prince's collection, so we start a pretty easy thing to do.

26:12.495 --> 26:15.619
Having identified this niche for yourself,

26:17.033 --> 26:20.938
Do you think that that scholarship has new knowledge about Copernicus?

26:21.018 --> 26:40.584
I mean, not just on his achievement, but on the history, on the reading history of the book and how it may have influenced... Well, yes, there's a considerable information that turns up about the ebb and flow of astronomy in the rest of that century.

26:41.044 --> 26:45.370
There is another thing that you should probably look at, and...

26:45.923 --> 26:51.091
I'll have to go in the other room to get you a copy of it.

26:56.038 --> 27:07.175
But in fact, I made a list of the articles that have been written about the census in one aspect or another, and there are, I suppose, 10 of them.

27:07.715 --> 27:14.125
So it has, in addition to the census, has had a continuing stream of

27:14.442 --> 27:16.063
of scholarly articles.

27:17.004 --> 27:21.108
I'll lend you a copy of this, but I really would like to get it back.

27:21.928 --> 27:24.951
How about if I... Do you mind if I copy some pages out of it?

27:25.131 --> 27:26.092
No, no, no.

27:26.152 --> 27:26.893
Copy some pages.

27:26.933 --> 27:27.914
That's no problem.

27:27.954 --> 27:30.015
I'll get it back to you by the end of the week.

27:30.055 --> 27:31.637
Okay, fine.

27:32.037 --> 27:37.322
It describes one of the very interesting groups of copies.

27:37.342 --> 27:43.707
In fact, those that were attributed to Tycho Brahe, which then turned out to be Paul Wittig.

27:44.075 --> 28:01.979
As I say, and he's got four copies, and just last month we found this other very similar sort of person who's even more mysterious, who has, between himself and his students, six copies.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.140
Wow.

28:03.160 --> 28:09.829
Have you become a borderline biblio main on...

28:09.978 --> 28:11.400
in the pursuit of this one book?

28:11.420 --> 28:20.010
I mean, would you like to own a... I would like to own a copy of it, but it's always been a situation that I would have had to mortgage the house in order to own it.

28:20.751 --> 28:24.356
And so I own a second edition, but not a first.

28:25.477 --> 28:27.239
But what do you feel?

28:27.640 --> 28:37.352
Do you feel anything physically when you handle the first, or is it really a scholarly... Yeah, I've looked at it so often that it's one, and I've

28:37.602 --> 28:44.211
And I've had a number of times I've had copies here in the office for some weeks.

28:44.231 --> 28:53.464
So I can't exactly say how many copies have passed through this office, but a number of them.

28:55.106 --> 28:57.029
It's 20 years, right, that you've been involved in this?

28:57.109 --> 28:57.429
Yeah.

28:57.449 --> 28:59.151
Did you have any idea that it would be?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.093
No, no, I don't know.

29:00.593 --> 29:04.519
I certainly would have done a lot of things differently if I'd known what it was going to lead to.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.141
For instance...

29:06.678 --> 29:18.793
There are so many of these little libraries in provincial towns in Germany and Italy, I think I would have made my own Michelin type of maps on how to find the library.

29:19.394 --> 29:31.789
Scholars would think this was great to be able to buy a set of maps, because in general, you get wonderful little town maps, but they don't necessarily show you where the library is.

29:32.009 --> 29:33.711
We got fairly good at it.

29:33.751 --> 29:36.094
We would make a beeline for the train station.

29:36.698 --> 29:42.947
go in there because almost invariably there would be a map of the town and see where in the world this library was.

29:43.568 --> 29:45.470
And then we would head straight to it.

29:45.931 --> 29:51.358
It often meant going to two and occasionally even three libraries in a day.

29:51.398 --> 30:02.554
And when I was doing my main field trips, one had to be very carefully organized so that on a Sunday

30:02.753 --> 30:07.701
you were at a place that had wonderful museums because, in general, the libraries weren't open on Sunday.

30:08.002 --> 30:10.386
Have you, in fact, handled every book that you described?

30:12.590 --> 30:12.830
No.

30:13.191 --> 30:18.319
There are about five copies I haven't seen.

30:18.339 --> 30:18.580
Wow.

30:19.161 --> 30:26.132
But there are more than that stolen now or have disappeared into the market, so I've actually handled more copies than are now located.

30:26.152 --> 30:27.715
Oh, and if anybody can say that

30:29.062 --> 30:29.803
About any book?

30:29.863 --> 30:31.906
I mean, any great book?

30:31.966 --> 30:35.691
That's probably unique.

30:36.072 --> 30:45.825
I've formed the Petraeus Society, named after the printer of the book, and it's limited to those people who've looked at a hundred copies or more.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.210
And how many members are there?

30:49.550 --> 30:52.575
I believe there are four of us, including my wife.

30:53.296 --> 30:55.018
And did your wife share this story?

30:55.420 --> 31:01.206
Well, she likes to come to libraries, and she's been a beneficiary of a lot of travel.

31:01.647 --> 31:09.976
Can you think of any other books, great books, that could dare or that deserve this kind of inquiry?

31:13.540 --> 31:16.303
I'm sure one is enough for your lifetime, but I'm wondering.

31:16.323 --> 31:24.972
Yeah, if I had it to do again, I would probably simultaneously look at Kepler's Astronomia Nova.

31:25.407 --> 31:31.457
I might just try to get some feeling about that by sending out letters on it.

31:31.477 --> 31:34.261
I've located where there are 70 copies of that.

31:34.281 --> 31:42.875
I've done the greatest piece of printing of the 16th century, which is the Appianus Astronomicum Caesarium.

31:42.895 --> 31:44.237
Have you ever seen that book?

31:44.918 --> 31:48.243
I have seen something over 100 copies of that book.

31:48.263 --> 31:50.086
I think they have one at the Lilly Library.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.410
They do.

31:53.521 --> 32:02.957
So I've collated them, and that's such a complicated book because of all the moving parts that it's an interesting book to collate.

32:04.560 --> 32:13.215
Quite a story, and you know, it is ironic in a way, and I don't mean to overuse that word, but the whole purpose of printing is to replicate.

32:13.977 --> 32:17.723
And really, I'm supposed to know where all the copies go.

32:18.428 --> 32:20.391
And then what you try to do is go back.

32:20.611 --> 32:23.434
To undo the scattering of the feathers to the wind.

32:23.795 --> 32:24.296
There you go.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.099
I couldn't have said it.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.884
I mean, you mindfully were doing this, I guess, to try and go back.

32:31.465 --> 32:37.252
And to assess the influence, you have to find out as best you can where the books went.

32:37.272 --> 32:39.415
That's a pretty spectacular thing to do.

32:39.555 --> 32:43.440
Yes, because all of the finding aids are set up.

32:43.623 --> 32:49.129
with the idea in mind that you should be able to find a copy of a book if you need it.

32:49.149 --> 32:53.134
But they're not set up to find all copies of the book.

32:53.154 --> 33:02.085
And not only all copies, but to try and determine who has owned them through the centuries and how they may have influenced thought events.

33:03.686 --> 33:06.249
Pretty bold adventure.

33:07.351 --> 33:08.031
It's interesting.

33:08.212 --> 33:10.254
You find curious things in the process.

33:10.314 --> 33:11.115
For example,

33:11.517 --> 33:21.911
Cambridge, England, Oxford, the main university libraries did not ever have a first edition of this book until the last century.

33:22.672 --> 33:35.709
Now, the reason was that the book trade in England was very restricted because of the stationer's company and the business of importing books and so on.

33:36.490 --> 33:38.132
But most of the books

33:38.618 --> 33:47.953
Most of the first edition of Copernicus's book got into England by individual scholars who had worked on the continent, bringing them back.

33:50.557 --> 34:04.440
By that time, the book had a reputation so that when the second edition was published in Basel, the books came in in droves, so to say, so that the Bodleian had four copies of the second edition by 1650.

34:05.905 --> 34:11.210
But they didn't get a first edition until the 19th century because of antiquarian interest.

34:11.230 --> 34:23.462
And in both cases, both Cambridge and Oxford then got it through a benefactor because they were by that time getting interested in the antiquarian aspect.

34:23.482 --> 34:33.752
You mentioned in one of your notes in the census, and I just saw it briefly, that a communication with Julian Roberts at the Bodleian, who I interviewed two years ago when I was there,

34:34.458 --> 34:45.968
And it was right after the garden sale, and I had mentioned how the Don Quixote went for 1.6 million payments, Don Quixote, which went to a Spanish collector.

34:45.988 --> 34:48.731
And his line was, well, we got ours when it was issued.

34:49.352 --> 34:57.419
They had a bookseller in Spain, 1616 or whatever it was, I think it was published prior to that, and they bought it.

34:57.439 --> 35:03.064
But he said, we never got a first folio until the late 1900s.

35:04.141 --> 35:09.128
British writers, English writers, they didn't collect at the Bodleian.

35:09.609 --> 35:12.913
It's very kind of inconsistent with what you just described.

35:14.055 --> 35:17.399
Yeah, it's somewhat capricious.

35:17.780 --> 35:27.213
Julian Roberts was very, very helpful to me because in the Bodleian, the books are still classified by the benefactions.

35:28.174 --> 35:33.962
So he took me down to the stacks so that I could see what other kind of books were coming.

35:34.330 --> 35:37.774
with the Copernicus each time.

35:37.934 --> 36:01.843
I've got so good that I can sort of spot the word Copernicus on a sheet of newsprint, so that I went through the donors' books, the vellum-bound books in which all the donations had been written, and managed to find every one of their Copernicus books so that I knew where it had come from, which is, you know, scanning a lot of entries before those words jumped out.

36:02.564 --> 36:03.645
This will probably...

36:04.452 --> 36:07.216
The census will be published, you hope, next year.

36:07.616 --> 36:07.937
I hope.

36:08.317 --> 36:15.427
And does that, in your mind, conclude the quixotic way?

36:18.111 --> 36:21.656
The problem is they do keep coming out of the woodwork.

36:21.676 --> 36:24.840
Like, for instance, Jack Pickett, as I mentioned, this is a little wrinkle.

36:25.441 --> 36:26.583
He gave it to his son-in-law.

36:26.683 --> 36:29.687
Yeah, but, I mean, it's a copy I've seen, so that's okay.

36:29.847 --> 36:31.810
It's copies that are totally unknown to me.

36:32.228 --> 36:38.854
like a second edition, which just turned up in the sale in Germany a few weeks ago.

36:40.796 --> 36:45.020
What happens to you when you see something like that?

36:45.040 --> 36:46.602
Is it an unrecorded copy?

36:46.622 --> 36:47.363
It's an unrecorded copy.

36:47.383 --> 36:48.764
Or a copy that you haven't recorded?

36:48.784 --> 36:49.925
It's a copy.

36:49.945 --> 36:50.766
Nobody's recorded.

36:51.246 --> 36:58.253
And I got in touch with the auctioneer right away, and he said, oh,

36:58.587 --> 37:00.429
We knew you'd seen the first edition.

37:00.469 --> 37:03.793
We didn't realize you were going after the second edition as well.

37:04.554 --> 37:05.154
That's so funny.

37:05.254 --> 37:09.439
We will try to tell you where it's gone.

37:10.900 --> 37:16.366
But before he had a chance to tell me where it's gone, the grapevine had worked and I had found out.

37:18.629 --> 37:22.333
How did this feed in with your teaching and your work here?

37:24.507 --> 37:28.991
Oh, I regale the students with tales of book hunting from time to time.

37:30.272 --> 37:45.247
Now, it doesn't directly, but when I give a lecture, let's say, to the sophomores who are just joining the history science program, I include some of the flavor of this because it can give them a hint about the excitement of the chase.

37:45.827 --> 37:50.572
And you have been a detective, a literary detective, and that's some kind of fun, I guess.

37:51.152 --> 37:52.894
One has to be in order to...

37:53.178 --> 37:54.540
keep track of where the books are.

37:55.121 --> 38:03.391
It's interesting because you saw the foreword probably to the great Copernicus case where I described being in federal district court.

38:04.293 --> 38:18.291
That copy has now escaped my net because it was sold at auction and bought by Jake Zeitlin, but Jake Zeitlin has died, and no

38:18.693 --> 38:22.036
obvious record was kept as to where he sent the book.

38:22.357 --> 38:29.344
He was always very free in telling me where the books went, and that just got through.

38:30.064 --> 38:31.706
Where did his records go?

38:32.927 --> 38:39.213
His records have been taken over by one of his junior colleagues, who said it would be like looking at a needle in a haystack to find it.

38:39.414 --> 38:41.936
Well, somebody should do that.

38:41.956 --> 38:42.577
Somebody could do that for you.

38:42.777 --> 38:43.738
Well, sometime.

38:44.107 --> 38:50.955
I mean, the records are there, but the obvious places in the records, he looked and didn't find it.

38:50.975 --> 39:00.347
And it was owned jointly with the 19th Century Bookshop in Baltimore, and they say, Jake handled it, and they haven't a clue.

39:01.248 --> 39:02.329
Strange.

39:02.349 --> 39:03.510
Yeah.

39:03.530 --> 39:04.892
Maybe I can help on that.

39:04.952 --> 39:05.313
We'll see.

39:05.333 --> 39:05.733
Hold on.

39:05.753 --> 39:07.856
Have you talked to Mel Edelstein at the Getty?

39:07.936 --> 39:13.743
He's very close to Jake, and he did the oral history of Jake, right?

39:13.763 --> 39:13.863
Yeah.

39:13.883 --> 39:14.063
It's big.

39:14.212 --> 39:14.853
I see.

39:14.873 --> 39:19.137
Well, if you come across anything on it, I'd be fascinated to know.

39:19.358 --> 39:25.885
I'm writing my California chapter right now, so I'm in this stuff.

39:26.926 --> 39:34.214
If we could talk a little bit about Mr. O'Moore, I'd be fascinated to have you tell me.

39:34.755 --> 39:41.502
You said that there was a story going around through the grapevine that he actually had talked about.

39:41.768 --> 39:54.701
taking the library and putting it into... Into orbit, and I haven't any idea at this point who mentioned that or how serious it was.

39:55.181 --> 39:59.586
Knowing Haven, he could very well have come up with a bizarre idea like that.

40:00.347 --> 40:08.755
Well, if you read the introduction to this, getting the library ready for the great movement towards the stars, I mean, if you take him at his word,

40:09.275 --> 40:11.658
of what the library was intended for.

40:11.698 --> 40:14.021
It's consistent with what he says in that book.

40:14.041 --> 40:14.441
Okay.

40:15.042 --> 40:19.147
I mean, when you said that, I was speechless.

40:19.727 --> 40:21.990
But then I thought, do I believe it?

40:22.391 --> 40:23.132
Yeah, I do.

40:23.172 --> 40:29.159
I mean, I believe it being something... I guess you think you get to know him pretty well.

40:29.379 --> 40:35.506
Well, I don't suppose anybody knew him very well, but I knew him.

40:36.387 --> 40:37.729
I mean, we met...

40:38.519 --> 41:07.497
reasonably often and i would occasionally call him up about something or other did he ever indicate how great his collection was oh he often told me what was in it did you ever express an interest in seeing any of it or did he ever offer you enough he basically didn't offer to show me other things as i told you i was very keen uh toward the end to have an opportunity for a

41:07.831 --> 41:11.335
colleague from England to see the John Locke manuscript.

41:11.355 --> 41:12.436
Oh, could you tell me about that?

41:12.476 --> 41:14.178
That's a very interesting story, by the way.

41:14.338 --> 41:15.380
Could you go through that again?

41:16.140 --> 41:20.505
One of the scholars in Keele, in England.

41:21.026 --> 41:21.947
And how do we spell that?

41:23.108 --> 41:24.770
K-E-E-L-E.

41:24.790 --> 41:24.890
Okay.

41:24.910 --> 41:25.992
It's university there.

41:27.674 --> 41:33.400
Okay.

41:33.717 --> 41:37.602
It's, again, the fact that I got on to him was interesting.

41:37.702 --> 41:59.151
It was because I eventually stumbled on the fact that at Keel there was an interesting collection of science books, and it turns out that there are more books from Isaac Newton's library than any place outside of Cambridge because there was a

41:59.468 --> 42:04.953
a civil servant whose hobby was science books, and he kept buying them.

42:04.973 --> 42:18.746
And eventually, he was looking for some place to send his books, and I don't know how the connection with Keele developed, but he decided that would be an interesting place to put them, so he put them all there, including at Copernicus.

42:18.766 --> 42:28.395
So when I was up to Keele, I talked to him, and

42:28.612 --> 42:54.231
and discovered that he was very interested in in john locke because he was putting out the edition of on human understanding for oxford university press do you remember the scholars not instantaneously i could probably dig it up at some point i might follow i'd be curious anyway let's continue well in any event uh he managed to get some funding to travel

42:54.548 --> 43:01.857
to come over here, and we were arranging so that, okay, he'd come over to give a colloquium at Harvard and he could look at this book.

43:02.218 --> 43:12.731
And Haven agreed that, yeah, he'd let him see it, put it in the library temporarily or something, but he kept saying, it's inconvenient to get it right now, he said.

43:12.751 --> 43:19.479
And he eventually allowed that, in fact, there was a problem because of a court case.

43:19.499 --> 43:21.822
So this must have been about 1988 or 89?

43:22.423 --> 43:23.104
I guess so.

43:23.776 --> 43:24.517
Does that sound right?

43:24.537 --> 43:26.040
Right before the sale.

43:26.060 --> 43:26.160
Okay.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.143
It was the year before the sale.

43:28.183 --> 43:29.485
88 is on the court.

43:29.505 --> 43:31.809
The case started in July of 1988.

43:32.530 --> 43:32.930
Okay.

43:33.892 --> 43:39.681
So we had January of 1988.

43:39.701 --> 43:47.413
I don't know when Haven first told me about the trial.

43:47.453 --> 43:49.817
He and Luria mentioned it several times.

43:50.489 --> 44:01.761
repeatedly that there was some sort of litigation going on that made it difficult to see the books, and that he didn't have easy access to them because they were in the bank vault.

44:03.183 --> 44:05.485
But he said, you know, just wait.

44:05.645 --> 44:07.868
It will be possible for him to see them.

44:07.888 --> 44:12.833
He said, I don't have any objection to his seeing them, but that I can't do it right now.

44:13.754 --> 44:20.361
So eventually I learned that they were all going up for sale, and so I

44:21.860 --> 44:35.701
When Sotheby's asked me about the Copernicus, I asked them about the On Human Understanding manuscript and they said, well, that one is being described in London because it was broken.

44:35.741 --> 44:40.428
Some of them were described in London and some of them were described in New York.

44:40.448 --> 44:44.554
And I said, well, there's an expert on it who very much would like to see it.

44:45.295 --> 44:50.483
And so I contacted him and they arranged for him to come down and

44:50.851 --> 44:52.313
have the chance to look at it.

44:52.513 --> 44:54.416
So he was very pleased to see it.

44:54.516 --> 45:12.099
Ironic, isn't it, in a way that the circumstance under which the scholar gets to see it is in the auction house prior to its dismissal, as opposed to an institution where normally you might think... I have, on a number of occasions, been able to see books in the auction house.

45:12.119 --> 45:13.141
Really?

45:13.701 --> 45:16.745
And one which frustrated me a great deal.

45:18.327 --> 45:20.250
They had assured me I'd be able to see it,

45:20.500 --> 45:29.433
But when I showed up, they said, well, we auctioned it yesterday, and almost invariably people leave the books for us to ship them.

45:29.453 --> 45:34.821
But in this case, it was this anonymous buyer who absolutely insisted on taking it off instantly.

45:35.662 --> 45:38.306
And so they said, we're sorry, but it isn't here anymore.

45:38.686 --> 45:41.971
And I was 24 hours too late to see it.

45:42.111 --> 45:45.276
Eventually, I had the book here in this office, so I did see it.

45:45.577 --> 45:51.384
But it took me well over a year to find out where it had gone.

45:51.404 --> 45:56.690
Did you say that Haven and Luria had indicated that they met?

45:56.710 --> 46:03.278
One of these magnetic moments where she was working in an, I think you said, an aerospace... In an aerospace company.

46:03.739 --> 46:08.084
And she said that... He said?

46:08.104 --> 46:14.892
He said that when he saw her, he was very much struck by her and said...

46:15.057 --> 46:19.703
to his companion with him, you see that girl over there?

46:20.724 --> 46:23.447
I think I'll marry her, or that's the girl I'm going to marry.

46:24.288 --> 46:36.083
And then Maria said she saw him come in, and she was very much struck by his charm, and she was married at the time.

46:36.143 --> 46:41.769
She said she deliberately put her hands under her desk so that he couldn't see the rain.

46:42.831 --> 46:44.693
Wow.

46:45.466 --> 46:46.407
Did he?

46:46.427 --> 46:52.434
So they both verified the story from the two different viewpoints.

46:52.474 --> 46:57.541
What actually interests me more than anything is that he may actually have been in an aerospace plant.

46:59.082 --> 47:03.728
Do you think, in fact, he was doing some kind of consultation for these companies?

47:03.848 --> 47:04.729
That's what he claimed.

47:05.610 --> 47:10.717
He claimed it here, and he claimed it, and I can find no evidence of this.

47:10.737 --> 47:12.739
This is why I'm interested in the story, not so much

47:13.141 --> 47:17.047
about the attraction, but did he actually possible?

47:17.527 --> 47:23.316
Do you think he has the intellect to do the kinds of consultations that he claims?

47:24.077 --> 47:27.802
Weapons development and high-level mathematical things?

47:27.822 --> 47:28.703
I haven't a clue.

47:31.908 --> 47:41.882
Did he impress you as a guy who was fluent in ancient Greek manuscripts and Hebrew manuscripts and could translate these things with ease?

47:42.301 --> 47:46.706
A hundred learned papers might be the measure of his accomplishments.

47:47.647 --> 47:54.495
He always carried on to give that impression and that general aura.

47:55.036 --> 48:07.971
And Pierre Barrette, the dealer in Paris, had often wanted to meet him and had been frustrated in this attempt.

48:08.373 --> 48:11.217
And he said, I am coming to Boston.

48:11.237 --> 48:15.143
Do you think there's any possible way that you could arrange an introduction?

48:15.583 --> 48:16.745
So I said, I think so.

48:17.366 --> 48:20.170
And so I arranged for it, and we all went out to eat together.

48:20.690 --> 48:29.623
And it was a fascinating conversation, because Haven and Beres were spending the entire evening trying to one-up each other.

48:30.224 --> 48:36.152
And Haven's knowledge of literary materials

48:36.385 --> 48:41.913
was good enough to hold his own with the rest for that whole evening.

48:42.815 --> 48:47.642
Do you have some recollection of when this might have been?

48:47.662 --> 48:55.033
After the Arthur Houghton sale, before the Arthur Houghton sale, which is 79 and 80?

48:55.474 --> 48:57.397
My guess is it was soon after that.

48:58.078 --> 49:03.266
You could see basically a riot on the world scene.

49:03.286 --> 49:05.329
It would have been in the early 80s probably.

49:05.933 --> 49:09.178
Because really, if you knew him... I had forgotten about that incident.

49:09.198 --> 49:15.327
I mean, you've jogged my memory, but that was my job.

49:15.928 --> 49:27.326
Because really, if you knew him in 74 or 75, right after, soon after he buzzed, you were one of the few people at that time who knew he was building a major collection.

49:27.346 --> 49:33.375
Now, he was dealing heavily with John Fleming in New York and Warren Howell on the West Coast.

49:34.064 --> 49:42.592
But according to Steven Massey at Christie's, for instance, he really arrived in 79 when he bought Boldly at the Houghton sale in London.

49:42.612 --> 49:45.774
And then everybody in Beres would be another one, yet another.

49:46.335 --> 49:51.580
There's a many number of dealers now who really were quite eager to make his acquaintance.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.260
It's fascinating.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.561
It struck me if I still think.

49:53.942 --> 49:54.682
Let's see.

49:56.284 --> 49:59.807
I was on a sabbatical leave when I met him, and I always have to work out.

50:00.347 --> 50:00.848
Haven, or?

50:00.968 --> 50:03.210
Haven, yeah.

50:03.680 --> 50:15.992
Um... This was, uh, in... 77, I guess.

50:16.012 --> 50:16.853
Okay.

50:16.873 --> 50:22.138
Well, you have 75 as the earliest it could have been, because that's when it was listed in the LDF catalog.

50:22.158 --> 50:23.339
It couldn't have been prior to that.

50:23.359 --> 50:24.920
He had telephoned me before.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.041
Okay.

50:26.061 --> 50:29.064
So I had talked to him on the phone before that.

50:29.425 --> 50:32.067
But, and then, somehow,

50:34.375 --> 50:37.698
He got wind of the fact that I was in Cambridge at the time.

50:38.639 --> 50:38.839
Haven did.

50:38.859 --> 50:39.700
Yeah.

50:39.720 --> 50:46.167
And he called me in Cambridge, indicating that he was not far.

50:46.287 --> 50:54.975
He was at... I can't... No, no, no, no.

50:54.995 --> 50:56.757
I'm talking about Cambridge England.

50:56.857 --> 50:59.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:59.180 --> 50:59.940
This is England.

51:00.561 --> 51:00.801
Yeah.

51:00.821 --> 51:03.724
He was at... It's not me, town.

51:03.957 --> 51:04.778
I can't remember.

51:04.978 --> 51:08.021
It's a horse racing town outside of Cambridge.

51:08.182 --> 51:18.673
That must be where Canes had his place.

51:18.693 --> 51:25.140
And he was at the hotel in Cambridge, but had gone over to see him.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.422
Which Canes is it that does the bibliographies?

51:29.785 --> 51:31.146
Here's one of them up on the shelf.

51:36.847 --> 51:49.442
And he was there because they were arranging for a blank exhibition.

51:49.462 --> 51:52.085
And he owned by that time some blanks.

51:53.327 --> 51:57.412
And he was lending them for this exhibition.

51:57.432 --> 51:57.792
Yeah.

51:58.092 --> 52:01.775
He may not have had all of them, but he had the first part of them in there.

52:02.015 --> 52:05.458
He brought heavily from Colin Franklin outside of Oxford.

52:05.478 --> 52:08.981
In fact, I went to interview Franklin at Oxford.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.082
I'm sorry, I interrupted there.

52:10.142 --> 52:11.043
Well, that's okay.

52:11.444 --> 52:27.137
He had been out to see Jeffrey Cain's, and he had taken his Harvey book along in order to show it, in order to get a reading about how good this was.

52:27.809 --> 52:39.065
And he said he was on his way back to London, and I said, what a coincidence, we're going into London because I have some business to do there.

52:39.105 --> 52:42.229
If you want, you can go into London with us.

52:42.249 --> 52:56.128
So the first time I met him was then driving up at the hotel in Cambridge, England, and he and his wife were standing there, and we introduced ourselves, got in the car and drove to London.

52:56.733 --> 52:57.854
You drove?

52:57.994 --> 53:00.097
I drove.

53:00.437 --> 53:07.165
Nicholas Barker, who writes the introduction to this, mentions that he, I think, met Haven once at Haynes' house.

53:07.646 --> 53:09.588
I think it's in that introduction there.

53:11.030 --> 53:15.595
When I interviewed Nicholas Barker... That dovetails, doesn't it?

53:15.775 --> 53:18.198
That was probably the time.

53:18.999 --> 53:20.701
But that's the only time he met Haven.

53:22.023 --> 53:25.727
And I asked him, because he wrote such a wonderful introduction.

53:26.855 --> 53:30.503
And I said, gee, you must have been very impressive how quick it was.
