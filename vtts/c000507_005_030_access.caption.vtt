00:01.080 --> 00:06.720
In my frame of reference, they're both speculative fiction.

00:11.400 --> 00:21.760
There's an awful lot of discussion about this. I don't think it's a very
productive kind of a discussion. Practically everything, there certainly is

00:21.760 --> 00:36.580
fiction based upon cold, hard science. There's no question about that. And on
the other hand, there's fiction based upon fairies and wizards. But in general,

00:37.000 --> 00:49.960
most of the stories that you read are all based upon invented laws

00:49.960 --> 00:51.580
of science which aren't in evidence.

00:54.480 --> 01:16.420
And it's kind of a very difficult line of distinction to make here. Now, as far
as I, all this aside, I will say that I start, even though I don't feel that I

01:16.420 --> 01:30.300
say that there's a very thin, if any, boundary between these two things. In
general, I think I start with a mood of a story. Rather than a plot or anything

01:30.300 --> 01:46.900
of the sort, I start with a mood. And then go on and flesh it out and put
characters to the mood and atmosphere and background, stuff like that. And in

01:46.900 --> 01:55.920
this mood, of course, takes account of the fact that the situations are more or
less plausible and possible and credible.

01:59.860 --> 02:12.220
Probably I could state that better by saying that the assumptions are more
familiar. Because given any assumptions, every story starts out with a set of

02:12.220 --> 02:25.920
assumptions which a reader is required to believe in. And with the so-called,
the more closer the stuff is to pure science and the more familiar to the

02:25.920 --> 02:36.740
reader, or not to the reader so much, but the more familiar to the scientific
community is the assumptions. And the closer you get to pure fantasy, then the

02:36.740 --> 02:45.640
more remote are the assumptions made. But the assumptions are there just less,
or there are less. If you don't have these basic assumptions, then you don't

02:45.640 --> 02:55.680
have any story. Now, what was the first part of your question once more? I
answered the last. I forgot what the first part was. Okay, hold on one moment.

03:00.060 --> 03:12.240
Yes, Mr. Vance, I asked how you proceeded from your ideas to a completed story.
Well, I can't answer that. It's because I don't know myself. It's just a matter

03:12.240 --> 03:16.980
of sitting

03:16.980 --> 03:32.100
down and working around an idea and putting, fleshing it out, so to speak. It's
just the same way as if you were painting a landscape. Okay, you'd take a

03:32.100 --> 03:41.380
pencil, maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't, and draw in an outline of a tree in
a house, and then take up the color and start smearing red green for the

03:41.380 --> 03:53.660
foliage, and a circle of smoke coming out of the chimney of the house, and
geraniums in the window boxes. In other words, you start in with a framework and

03:53.660 --> 04:09.340
then start elaborating upon it. That's about the best I can tell you. Does that
suit you, but doesn't it? Oh, yes, very much. We have another second person in

04:09.340 --> 04:20.340
here for a question. All right. I prefer you to only ask one question at a time
so I don't get confused. Okay. Mr. Vance, what method do you use to come up with

04:20.340 --> 04:22.680
the names for your characters and places?

04:25.400 --> 04:42.140
This is a, this is a, I do it very carefully. And it's, it's not in a myth. It
is not just random picking a name out of the phone book at all. What you're

04:42.140 --> 04:49.860
hearing in the background there, there's a gang of birds from cages right over
here. They hear me talking like this. They get annoyed, and they'll start

04:49.860 --> 05:03.840
yelling and screaming, too. You may hear them. I don't know. But anyway, the
names for the characters, they have to be such that they don't intrude on the

05:03.840 --> 05:15.480
reader's notice. Every time he reads them, he says, Oh, that's a strange thing.
What's a strange name with all these odd-looking consonants? The name has to be

05:15.480 --> 05:31.040
such that it'll flow along in the reading and not, not the, not the reader's
tongue won't trip over it every time he gets to it. Still, you don't do it like

05:31.040 --> 05:46.520
it's a comic strip. In a comic strip, the bad guys are always called Ganar or
Nash or something, you know. That's, that's really getting too, too basic. You

05:46.520 --> 05:56.440
don't do it that way. But you do it in more subtle ways. You, you

05:56.440 --> 06:08.920
possibly go back to the roots of the language, roots of either Germanic language
or roots of Latin language. You come up with some kind of, I'm not saying I do

06:08.920 --> 06:22.420
this overtly, but it's a subconscious process. When you kind of write down names
that seem like they will fit this character and, and what he's supposed to do,

06:22.540 --> 06:31.980
what he's supposed to be. Then after you take all these things into
consideration, then you choose what name seems to fit. And as I say, it's not

06:31.980 --> 06:40.760
just an easy matter, although quite often a name will just suddenly pop out and
you know the name is right. But I, in my opinion, it's a pretty important

06:40.760 --> 06:52.480
matter, this nomenclature. It's nothing that it's, if any of you people would be
writers, I think you should pay a good deal of attention to it. Because if you

06:52.480 --> 07:02.800
don't, it detracts, it tracts up the reader when he goes through your story.
It's going to fall all over that name. You know, it's phony. You know, you can't

07:02.800 --> 07:13.640
have phony names in your story. You can't have anything phony. You don't have to
blend in and, there you hear that bird? Hear it? Maybe, maybe not. Well, there's

07:13.640 --> 07:26.100
maybe a difference. Anyway, that's the answer. Okay, very good. I have a
question, but mine's a multiple question. I'm sorry to ask you, but... Well, ask

07:26.100 --> 07:35.060
a part of... I'll just ask a piece at a time. Do you find science fantasy easier
to write than science fiction? What did you say again? Do you find science

07:35.060 --> 07:48.200
fantasy easier to write than science fiction? Well, not particularly. It's all
about the same. Okay. And do you find that you get more, I don't know,

07:49.200 --> 08:00.420
gratification in explaining in science fiction than you would in science fantasy
where you can run away on other aspects of the story? Well, when I was first

08:00.420 --> 08:12.700
starting out, this is the age when science fiction was real science fiction. You
know, when John Campbell ran Astounding Magazine, and he wanted science fiction

08:12.700 --> 08:26.400
to be science fiction. And everybody was kind of slavishly running that route.
And I tried to, and I did some perfectly decent stories along those lines. But I

08:26.400 --> 08:38.300
found that it was kind of tiresome. And a lot of the stories depended on some
little known trick of, oh, like superconductivity.

08:40.340 --> 08:55.220
For instance, I wrote a story once on the idea that sea creatures sequestered
rare elements, rare minerals from the ocean water to build a story in this fact.

08:55.740 --> 09:07.860
But I decided that this wasn't my, I didn't like doing it that way. I wasn't
really interested in writing stories about science. I have a very good

09:07.860 --> 09:21.120
scientific background. I know science. You know, so it's not that I'm ignorant.
But I like to work the science into the stories rather than write the stories

09:21.120 --> 09:39.880
about science, if you see the distinction. So the word science and science
fiction maybe is, well, anyway, as the years went on, I just became, the science

09:39.880 --> 09:48.440
became more cultural, anthropological science, if you want to put it that way.
If there's any science in that at all. All right, what's the second question?

09:49.300 --> 09:52.980
No, you covered everything pretty well. Thank you. That was a very good answer.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.100
Okay, next question.

10:03.660 --> 10:11.320
Okay. Mr. Vance. Speaking. What makes you write? What inside you makes you tick?

10:14.800 --> 10:28.300
Now, that is a very personal question. I don't even see any reason why I should
answer it. Not because I'm shy, but that's a, that's a, well, I could ask the

10:28.300 --> 10:34.060
same of you. What's inside you? What makes you tick? What makes you go to
school?

10:37.200 --> 10:52.260
Why do you study? Why do you survive? I was getting at a question. Let's go on
to another question. Okay. Why do you write? Is it money? I don't want to answer

10:52.260 --> 10:54.960
that question. That's my business. Okay. That's fair enough.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.440
Okay. Next question. Okay. It takes, it takes a moment to filter them in and out
of the room without even getting feedback from the speakerphone system here.

11:11.740 --> 11:22.540
Okay. We got the next guy here. Ready? Mr. Vance, in this story, the sun is red.
And I was wondering how you could have that considering when the sun, when our

11:22.540 --> 11:34.880
sun will be red, the earth will be inside the sun. This is, uh, this is sheer
fantasy here. This is, uh, well, it's not necessarily so because there are dwarf

11:34.880 --> 11:45.580
red stars that are smaller than the current sun here now. Uh, I think the
progression of the sun though, first it gets to be a very large giant red sun

11:45.580 --> 12:04.040
that shrinks. I think that's a sequence. Uh, but still, still in all, uh, these,
these particular stories to which you refer, there, there are essentially

12:04.040 --> 12:19.960
fantasy stories. And the background is magic. I deal with magic in the, in, uh,
the stories. If, if I have to worry about whether or how big the sun is, I might

12:19.960 --> 12:32.880
as well worry about how magic works or worry about any other things. The, uh,
that's just one of the assumptions which we are asked to accept, deal with and

12:32.880 --> 12:46.520
bring the story here is that the earth is so old, the sun is become old and red.
Now, it's may, I'm not absolutely certain whether the sun can become a dwarf red

12:46.520 --> 12:59.380
star if we have to go that route without becoming a giant red star. It may be,
it may be, it may well be that the sun possibly could become a dwarf star. Uh,

13:01.320 --> 13:13.480
although in these stories, I, I generally assume sun is a little larger in
diameter than, than it is now. So, so it wouldn't exactly be a dwarf star. It

13:13.480 --> 13:16.940
would be, uh, but again, this is, uh,

13:20.400 --> 13:31.520
this is just decoration in the story, you might say. It's no, no scientific
justification for it. Anymore, there's scientific justification for, uh, the,

13:31.620 --> 13:46.040
uh, ideas of magic. Next question. Mr. Vance, in your book, The Dying Earth, uh,
what happened to civilization as we know it? Uh, once again, please, louder. In

13:46.040 --> 13:57.760
your book, The Dying Earth, what happened to civilization as we know it? Well,
uh, when? When the sun goes out? Uh, before that. Uh, you start the book off

13:57.760 --> 14:09.640
and, you know, there's the origin of mirror. Don't forget, this is, uh, many,
many billion years according to the story. And there's been many different

14:09.640 --> 14:23.660
civilizations. Up, down, civilizations wiped out. Uh, I, I usually think that,
uh, I, I talk about there being, I, in fact, to tell you the truth, I've, I've

14:23.660 --> 14:36.480
seen an inconsistency. In one of my books, I refer to 43 eons, A-E-O-N-S. In
another one of my books, I only deal with 21 eons. So, I made a blunder there.

14:36.660 --> 14:48.180
I, I forgot what, or how many eons I was using. And an eon is, well, you can
call it anything you like. But, uh, during, during this time span, civilizations

14:48.180 --> 15:01.980
have come and gone a hundred, thousand different times. So, uh, what we have at
this time, at this period, are, are little fragments of life scattered around

15:01.980 --> 15:11.580
the, the, the so-called dying. And that's not my title. I didn't give the book
that title, incidentally. I called it something else. But to tell you the truth,

15:11.680 --> 15:29.760
I've forgotten what I did call it. Uh, but, uh, by and large, the earth of, of
this particular time is kind of a wasteland, where a few isolated, uh,

15:31.320 --> 15:47.580
cities or, or, uh, collections or plots of people still live together for
various reasons. But the, the, the great civilizations are all gone. They're in

15:47.580 --> 16:01.720
the past. This is a, a time when people kind of wander around through the ruins.
That's for this dying earth, particular, uh, maybe your, ambience, atmosphere,

16:01.840 --> 16:12.240
whatever you want to call it. Next question. What happened to mankind as we know
it? Did they waste away or did they, uh, disappear? Uh, well, you read the

16:12.240 --> 16:14.680
books. I think it's all implicit in the books.

16:25.760 --> 16:39.860
Next question. Okay. Okay. In, uh, books like the dying earth, is there any
importance or relevance to the manner in which the characters speak? Uh, one

16:39.860 --> 16:48.460
thing I must say. You're, you're asking a lot of questions about the dying
earth. This story was written long, long, long, long time ago. And I don't know

16:48.460 --> 16:58.820
how old you people are that are asking the questions, but I probably wasn't a
great deal older than you were. I, I presume you're in your twenties. That's my

16:58.820 --> 17:12.540
guess. Uh, I wrote a lot of this stuff while I was a seaman board ship. I was a
deckhand, able seaman. And, uh, for a long time, I couldn't get them published.

17:14.080 --> 17:31.540
And, uh, I had them, I had these things, uh, just on my files, you might say,
for quite a while. But now, these, these things are some of my first written

17:31.540 --> 17:47.800
works. Yes. Now, uh, I, uh, written an enormous amount of stuff since, which,
which, uh, I personally like better than the dying earth. And I think the dying

17:47.800 --> 17:57.520
earth, although many people like these books, and I guess they must have had a
lot of, a lot of color and a lot of drive to them. I've been told this. But, uh,

17:58.160 --> 18:09.740
we seem to be focusing a great deal on the dying earth, which is all right. I
don't mind. Ask all, ask all about who you want. I'll answer you. But the, uh,

18:14.320 --> 18:28.900
there's, uh, uh, just, uh, anyway, there are, I've written other books beside
that. I just want to point this out. Now, this dying earth thing, uh, I forgot

18:28.900 --> 18:37.920
your question. What was your question again? He was just asking a question about
the, uh, the style. It seems to be that the, the people in the book all speak

18:37.920 --> 18:51.100
with the same sort of, um. Yeah. Well, see, now this was a, uh, I, I wrote this
when

18:51.100 --> 19:10.920
I was rather young. And I was trying to achieve a consistency of tone. Now, for
instance, let me put it this way. If you're building a house in Texas, uh,

19:11.320 --> 19:25.080
you're not going to bring down some igloos from, uh, uh, from Alaska or some,
uh, mosques from, uh, from Turkey to put on the property. And you're not going

19:25.080 --> 19:36.800
to have the people that work for you speak in, uh, Yiddish or, uh, Polynesian.
You're all going to be, the, the, the house and the people that live there are

19:36.800 --> 19:49.340
going to be talking in Texas type language. The house is going to be Texas
style. You're going to have Texas style cows. And, uh, eat Texas chili. And I

19:49.340 --> 20:03.120
hope you don't use that hated tomato in your chili because I'm on that, uh, uh,
edge of the, the, the conflict with, believes that tomato is poisonous when it

20:03.120 --> 20:17.020
goes to chili. Uh, in any way I'm trying to say is that the, without being too
facetious here, is that, uh, I tried to make the conversation, uh, consistent

20:17.020 --> 20:33.900
with the, the dialogue consistent with the whole atmosphere. Correct? Anyway,
essentially that's the answer. No more, no less. When I succeeded, that's for

20:33.900 --> 20:34.340
you to say.

20:37.180 --> 20:44.000
Okay, Mr. Vance, let's, uh, before we let you go, I want to ask you a few about
Lioness. Um, one of your later works. Is that okay? Do you have time for a

20:44.000 --> 20:49.840
couple on that? Yeah, ask all night. I'm not doing anything. You're sitting
here. Okay, is it okay if we record this in case, uh, maybe we can get a couple

20:49.840 --> 20:58.640
radio shows out of it and send you the tapes? Would that be okay? Sure, go
ahead. Okay, um, we understand there was a delay in the Underwood Miller edition

20:58.640 --> 21:10.960
coming out. Can you tell us why that was? Yes, I can. It's, uh, it's just not
considered polite for, uh, Putnam, Berkeley Putnam, did not necessarily have to

21:10.960 --> 21:23.640
let, allow Tim Underwood to publish the Lioness at all. See, it's not in my
contract that, that allows Tim Underwood to publish these things. But they

21:23.640 --> 21:37.460
kindly, politely, graciously allowed Tim to publish 500 copies, hardcover. But
they wanted to have their version out first so that the reviews, such as they

21:37.460 --> 21:51.120
were, would specify the book was by Berkeley Putnam rather than Underwood Miller
book. So Tim delayed his publication until the Berkeley Putnam book hit the

21:51.120 --> 22:03.480
stand. It's just a matter of not only courtesy, but it's, and, or good, uh,
consideration, but it's just good, uh, common sense. Because if you don't, if

22:03.480 --> 22:11.800
you didn't play it that way, they'd never allow Tim to, the same privileges
again. In other words, they didn't have to allow him to publish the thing at

22:11.800 --> 22:23.780
all. They just said, go ahead, sure, you know, 500 copies is okay. Okay. So it's
just a, uh, it was just a matter of courtesy, uh, business courtesy between the

22:23.780 --> 22:37.840
two publishers. And Tim agreed to delay his publishing until their book hits the
stand. In other words, there won't be any difference at all in the two editions

22:37.840 --> 22:43.000
then? No, there's no differences. They're the same, the same text. It's just
that, uh,

22:47.320 --> 23:02.740
no, it's just, uh, no differences. It's just that, uh, one is hardcover. It's
got a beautiful, it's got a different cover on it. And, uh, and, uh, it's fine.

23:03.420 --> 23:15.820
I, I, but the text, the same, I didn't write two books, no. No, no way. Okay,
listen, uh, how long have you been planning lionesses? Is that a pretty recent

23:15.820 --> 23:28.880
plan, or did you go way back with that? Well, oddly enough, I had that thing in
my mind ever since I've been 12 years old. And that kind of a story, uh, it

23:28.880 --> 23:46.420
wasn't like lioness, or it wasn't plotted out this way, but, but I had that mood
with the idea of the story taking place in and around this forest. And with

23:46.420 --> 23:58.040
these kind of people, and in fact, I even started writing a, uh, some stories.
There were stories about that when I was just a little kid, 12 years, 14, I

23:58.040 --> 24:07.060
don't know how old I was. They got thrown away. I don't know what happened to
the damn thing. But, uh, then I, really, for telling you the truth, I've just

24:07.060 --> 24:25.420
forgot about it over the years. And then, recently, I decided I'd try a book
along these lines. And, uh, I instantly thought of this construction, or this,

24:25.440 --> 24:28.820
uh, background,

24:29.240 --> 24:43.540
which I developed back when I was, you know, back so long ago. And, uh, that's
where the thing, I won't say it ultimately derives there, because it's certainly

24:43.540 --> 24:57.800
just kind of a notion that all the flesh out of it is recent. But anyway, that's
more or less what happened. I know you have a great deal of, um, maybe not

24:57.800 --> 25:07.320
actual history, but legend, established legend, dealing with the Irish and
English and so forth. How much, in your estimation, was actual history or legend

25:07.320 --> 25:26.900
that you use as a framework? Well, the Irish and the English and the Welsh have,
all in their folklore, speak of these islands off the coast of England, south of

25:26.900 --> 25:51.060
England. They call them High Brazil. H-Y-I-S-I-L-L. High Brazil. And this is,
uh, fairly, uh, I, I haven't read, done all this much reading in the original

25:51.060 --> 26:07.100
sources by any means. But the, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's fairly clear that
these things are just legends without any basis of fact. The, uh, people of,

26:07.580 --> 26:18.880
oceanographers have studied the ocean floor. Out in this area here, they find no
signs of any submerged islands or anything of this sort. They're primarily

26:18.880 --> 26:28.100
looking for Atlantis, which is, of course, Atlantis is much, the site of
Atlantis is much farther to the south. Atlantis is supposed to be off, say, off

26:28.100 --> 26:45.360
Gibraltar. Out near to where, uh, well, there's nothing out there now, but it's
between the Azores and Gibraltar. But, uh, these elder isles would be about

26:45.360 --> 26:59.220
where I've placed them. There's always been these references to Avalon. And, uh,
this, the Lost City East, YS, has been placed, this is more or less for the

26:59.220 --> 27:08.540
French folklore. This has been off the coast of Cornwall, generally speaking.
It's a French literature, but I took some liberty there and I put it on the

27:08.540 --> 27:13.700
other side of the Elder Isles. Uh, Leoness is, uh,

27:17.400 --> 27:36.140
again, Lost Leoness is, uh, the subject, I believe, of, uh, well, I think
Debussy wrote a, I think Debussy wrote a piece called The Sunken Cathedral. The

27:36.140 --> 27:51.360
Sunken Cathedral was supposed to be the cathedral of Lost Leoness City. And that
was supposed to be off Cornwall somewhere. But, uh, there isn't any, any form or

27:51.360 --> 28:03.440
definite references, really, that you could point to and say, here is the
geography. The geography is something which I took some liberties to, mainly on

28:03.440 --> 28:13.500
the basis of these references to the island, High Brazil. and I called, I
removed the L, let's call the island Hybris, which you'll notice in the map.

28:15.620 --> 28:23.340
Yeah, okay, I think I know the answer to this, but maybe if you could clarify
it. The, uh, the witch, I think it's pronounced Desmay, changes into three

28:23.340 --> 28:35.840
things. Melanthi was the first. The third was burned. And I guess the second one
was, was Carfilio, right? Well, there's two, yeah, there's three. There were,

28:35.960 --> 28:46.860
there were three products for, but then, I don't really want to discuss, this is
something you have to read and derive for yourself. This is something that the

28:46.860 --> 29:00.760
author shouldn't have to explain. Uh, but there, there were three products from
that, from the destruction of the witch Desmay. Yes, there were. And if all, as

29:00.760 --> 29:10.320
I recall, it's stated there pretty categorically what happened. I think it was
too. Yeah, no, I think it was too. Okay. Okay, you put book one on the title

29:10.320 --> 29:20.620
page of Leoness. I assume then you have a good deal more material regarding
that. True. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm working on it, working on it right now,

29:20.820 --> 29:33.860
matter of fact, but actually I've, not this instrument, I'm kind of assembling
it, but I'm also doing, I'm doing something on, another book at the moment that

29:33.860 --> 29:45.360
I've got a, I've got a contract for and I've got to get out. I've just finished
a, a Kugel book, which is a, I've got a, well called a sequel, if you like, to a

29:45.360 --> 29:56.660
book called Eyes of the Overworld, which is not, again, not my title. I didn't
call it that, but some editor decided that was a good name and they used it. So,

29:57.200 --> 30:10.660
I've finished that. That'll be out in November. Then I've got this thing I've
got to get out. Then after that's out, then I'll do number two. And if, I get, I

30:10.660 --> 30:19.060
get the profit contracts and I'll do number three at the same time, I guess. In
other words, it's all kind of up in the air. I have to wait and see what the

30:19.060 --> 30:36.860
publisher says. Publishers advance. That book was a, a disaster. I don't want

30:36.860 --> 30:45.520
to see Eyes of the Overworld or is it a sequel to the Quest for Symbolists? And
will the Quest for Symbolists, uh, No, that Quest for Symbolists has got nothing

30:45.520 --> 31:01.680
to do with me. Uh, right, but it was Kugel and, um, Well, that's, that's Michael
Shays' book. No, I never even read the thing. No, The, the, uh, the, my, my book

31:01.680 --> 31:11.980
is a sequel to The Original Lies of the Overworld. What's the title of this new
Kugel one going to be? Does it have one yet? Uh, if I'm not mistaken, Dave

31:11.980 --> 31:22.600
Hartwell of Simon & Schuster, I think he's, again, calling it a title I don't
like very much. I think he's calling it The Kugel Sega, S-A-G-A, which I don't

31:22.600 --> 31:32.620
think is a good title with that. Riders don't have an awful lot of clout when it
comes to deciding what the title's going to be, but that'll be the name. S, at

31:32.620 --> 31:43.320
present, that's the name. S, be out in November, as I mentioned. Is it too early
to tell how Leonis is selling? I've heard it's selling pretty good, but, uh, I

31:43.320 --> 31:53.340
don't know exactly how good. I've just heard here and there, you know, that it
seems to be selling pretty good. How does it seem to be selling down your, into

31:53.340 --> 32:02.380
the woods? Yeah, pretty well. We were just at a convention, AggieCon, in College
Station, Texas, and the copies they had there, they sold. The ones that, I

32:02.380 --> 32:10.920
guess, were hot off the press had been sold, and we bought the Underwood Miller
copies here, two of us have. Uh-huh. Listen, I was going to pass along some

32:10.920 --> 32:20.420
information about Mexico. You still going? Well, yeah, I'd sure like to if I
can, if I can get enough time together. I had a friend who was just down there

32:20.420 --> 32:28.880
and he said the, uh, the exchange rate is 148 pesos to a dollar and you'd get
some fantastic bargains and everything. Where did he, where did he exchange at?

32:28.940 --> 32:37.180
At the border or in Mexico? Down in Mexico. I think he went to Chihuahua City
mostly is where he was and he, he did the exchange down there. Uh-huh. But he

32:37.180 --> 32:44.860
said the fantastic bargains, food, lodging, everything. Yeah. So if you go down
there, you ought to have a good time with the money anyhow. Yeah. I'd like to go

32:44.860 --> 32:53.120
down to Chihuahua and take that train over to the coast. You heard, you heard
about that? Yeah, oh yeah, that's, yeah, that's a great trip. Copper Canyon I

32:53.120 --> 32:58.720
think it's called. Yeah, they call it Copper Canyon. Yeah. Well, listen, Mr.
Vance, I'm done with you. I'm going to turn you over to David here. He's got a

32:58.720 --> 33:05.860
favor to ask you, but I appreciate very much your time and we're looking forward
to your future books. Thank you. And just a second now, David wants to ask you

33:05.860 --> 33:14.080
one thing before you go. All right. Okay, Mr. Vance, it doesn't look like we're
going to make it out to any of the cons in the west coast anytime soon and I was

33:14.080 --> 33:21.520
wondering if we, if a few of us here at the radio show might send you some books
in the mail for you to sign and get you to return them if we put return postage

33:21.520 --> 33:34.880
in there. Well, I've had so damn much trouble doing that, you know, that it's
trouble for my wife, really. She's had so much agony going through that, signing

33:34.880 --> 33:42.440
books, taking the post office and then people not sending enough postage that I
just kind of decided I wasn't going to do that anymore. I don't mean to be

33:42.440 --> 33:55.220
churlish about it, but it just makes so god damn much work around here that
this, well, I'll make an exception just once more, but you make sure, damn well

33:55.220 --> 34:06.340
sure you got enough postage, okay? Oh, no problem, we'll send and get all the
return, in other words, I don't mind doing as much if I don't have to squirrel

34:06.340 --> 34:15.600
around and find all the stuff to send it back here. No, we got that down to a
science. You'll just stick the label on, stick the stamps on and dump it back in

34:15.600 --> 34:28.060
the mail. All right, then there's no problem. But I've had time and time again
people send stuff here and it just caused no end to problems. But if you make it

34:28.060 --> 34:35.600
easy, then I don't mind doing it. I certainly don't mind signing your books
late. Okay, no, no, we've done this quite a bit because it's kind of hard. If

34:35.600 --> 34:43.360
you know where we are, we're in the middle of absolutely nowhere. And it's hard
to get out to some cons, so we've found that this works probably easiest for us.

34:43.580 --> 34:56.560
Where is Odessa in connection with, say, El Paso? If you draw a line between El
Paso and Dallas, that line would be nearly 400 miles long. Right in the middle

34:56.560 --> 35:09.840
of that line is Odessa. Because we're just thinking just if we have some friends
in New Mexico, chances are conceivable that we might drive down through El Paso,

35:09.860 --> 35:19.640
down into Chihuahua. Yeah, it's going out through Orores and whatnot. That's a
pretty common route, yeah. Although, I don't know, it's a long, long way. Yeah,

35:19.860 --> 35:27.560
I myself, I've never been to Mexico. I really hadn't thought about it, but with
the exchange rate the way it is, it seems like it would be quite the time. It's

35:27.560 --> 35:36.940
a shame not taking advantage of it. Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. I
might change my summer vacation plans here. How many people in your class? There

35:36.940 --> 35:48.360
are about 25 people in the class. What are their ages run? Their ages run
anywhere from 18 to the early 30s? Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, you were pretty right on

35:48.360 --> 35:57.740
the mark on your answer back there when they were asking about the dying earth.
Yeah. Yeah, I hate to talk about that. That seems to be, you know, it's

35:57.740 --> 36:06.520
something that, since was all right, but that's so long ago, you know, I hate to
be wasting all the time talking about that thing, but I've got a lot of other

36:06.520 --> 36:15.500
stuff since then that I think deserves more comment than that thing. But it's
all right, I'm not putting it down, why should I, you know, it made money for

36:15.500 --> 36:26.800
me. Yeah, I think what it is, it's been around for such an amount of time that
it's really getting in the era of being sort of a classic. Yeah, that's right.

36:26.980 --> 36:33.940
You know, kind of like Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way comes, you know,
we've taught them both books and we tend to look at them in the same light.

36:35.920 --> 36:47.400
Yeah, you may just be burdened with having a classic on your hands. Well, as
long as it doesn't cost me money. No, I ought to work the other way around.

36:47.760 --> 36:57.920
Well, no, I'm just joking. Yeah, yeah. Are you going to World Fantasy Con this
next year? No. Okay, I don't go to any conventions unless I get a big red carpet

36:57.920 --> 37:11.320
laid out from here to there with maidens with fans along the way. People offered
me beer at every ten steps and that kind of stuff. If you get offered a con like

37:11.320 --> 37:25.220
that, could you let us know we might just want to come watch? Well, I generally
don't even go to any conventions in the States with exceptions, but I like to go

37:25.220 --> 37:27.720
to foreign conventions because I, you know,

37:56.300 --> 38:07.140
I taken time out to talk with us and everything and the guys in the class really
do appreciate it. Not at all. I'm happy to help you and your work and give me a

38:07.140 --> 38:12.780
call if you have any other problems. Okay, okay, we appreciate it. We'll be in
touch and we'll send those books and we'll make sure to send enough return

38:12.780 --> 38:20.040
postage and everything. All right, very good. Okay, thank you again, sir. Bye
-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.820
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
