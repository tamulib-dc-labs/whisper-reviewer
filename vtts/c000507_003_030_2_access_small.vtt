00:01.740 --> 00:03.940
I'll take record of the rolling on this end.

00:07.180 --> 00:08.840
How long did you know, Howard?

00:12.060 --> 00:16.080
I don't remember just exactly when they moved to Cross Plains.

00:16.940 --> 00:22.980
It seemed to me like it was around 19 and 20 or 21.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.840
That's when I first became acquainted with him.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.800
He was probably 13 years old, something like that at that time.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.480
What was he like when he was a little boy?

00:39.360 --> 00:39.880
Break apart?

00:40.480 --> 00:43.200
What was he like when he was a boy at 13?

00:44.320 --> 00:45.920
He was just another kid.

00:45.920 --> 00:56.020
Just every small town boy, his father was a doctor, just a country doctor.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.400
His mother was Irish.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.380
She liked to use her Irish brogue.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.560
She really practiced on that.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.040
Robert was very studious in school.

01:24.420 --> 01:29.160
He didn't get out and play with the other kids a lot like most kids do.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.020
You lived right next door to him?

01:37.160 --> 01:39.080
Yeah, we lived right next door to you.

01:39.660 --> 01:44.160
Yeah, we lived right next door to each other.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.780
We lived in the house just east of our house.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.620
Do you know when he got interested in writing?

02:02.100 --> 02:05.960
No, but it was before he finished high school.

02:07.900 --> 02:11.140
I don't remember just when he finished high school.

02:11.140 --> 02:21.500
Probably about 1923 somewhere along there.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.260
But he was already writing those stories.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.260
Weird Tales was the magazine that published most of them.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.940
Did you read any of them when they came out?

02:39.680 --> 02:44.060
No, I tried. I didn't get interested in them.

02:44.160 --> 02:59.800
I was more interested in the western story type stuff that they published at that time.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.480
Did you ever read any of those?

03:10.340 --> 03:14.520
I don't remember. I might have. I don't remember.

03:16.340 --> 03:20.760
Do you remember if he ever talked much about the stuff he was writing about it?

03:24.020 --> 03:27.100
No, he wasn't close about it or anything.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.880
But it's been so long ago that I don't remember.

03:33.240 --> 03:40.380
There's been a lifetime in there that's gone by and I just don't remember.

03:51.200 --> 04:03.900
Do you remember any stories about Robert?

04:03.900 --> 04:08.660
Any particular thing that came to mind that was memorable about him?

04:09.780 --> 04:15.660
Well, about his home life, his private life there.

04:18.460 --> 04:30.900
He had a big log there, a tree trunk and a sledgehammer.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.840
I guess the thing would have weighed 12 or 14 pounds.

04:35.640 --> 04:45.300
He'd get out for his daily exercise and beat on that log with that big old sledgehammer

04:46.640 --> 04:50.420
until he had it beat the piece and he'd get another log.

04:52.200 --> 04:59.660
But he was exceptionally strong due to the fact that he exercised with this heavy hammer.

05:03.080 --> 05:10.140
He'd do that for an hour, maybe for longer, just beat on that log with that big old sledgehammer.

05:12.960 --> 05:22.320
Then he had a dog, just a big old occur dog, and his name was Patch, P-A-T-C-H.

05:24.760 --> 05:34.260
And when he had mealtime came, he'd fix up whatever the dog was going to eat and get out in the backyard

05:34.260 --> 05:40.000
and start calling the dog. He'd call him Chuck Patch.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.720
He'd call that a half a dozen times this old dog to come around wherever he was.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.120
But it was Chuck time.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.760
That was, principally, the things that he did.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.060
Later on he bought a car and he'd take rides out in the country.

06:05.340 --> 06:15.900
Sometimes with, Lindsay Tyson was a very good friend of his and single and they'd go out in the country together in his car.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.220
Just ride around, I judge.

06:21.780 --> 06:27.120
Now, Lindsay is dead, so you won't get to talk to him.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.240
When did he die?

06:34.940 --> 06:35.480
Thank you, pardon?

06:35.740 --> 06:37.500
When did Mr. Tyson die?

06:38.180 --> 06:41.320
Oh, just recently, about two or three years ago.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.240
Oh, okay, okay.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.300
Yeah, I've read about him and some of the research I've done on Mr. Hallard.

06:52.900 --> 07:00.380
You know if Howard was into hunting, there was a lot of West Texans really big on hunting.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.440
You know if Howard was a hunter?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.720
He never did, so far as I know.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.580
As far as I know, he did not own a rifle or a shotgun.

07:08.740 --> 07:12.740
He did buy a pistol and that was the guy he killed himself with.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.340
And if I remember right, it's been so long ago.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.500
I think it was a .32-20 caliber Colt.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.920
I may be wrong about the caliber, but I think that's what it was.

07:30.340 --> 07:35.020
Yeah, on some of the stuff that I've read, I've read a lot of different things.

07:37.080 --> 07:49.960
One of the people said that some of the people in Cross Plains had a feeling that Howard was going to commit suicide sometime because of his personality.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.580
Did you ever get that impression?

07:53.680 --> 08:01.720
What we heard, and we were, my wife and I were in California when he died.

08:03.160 --> 08:10.240
And this was in 1936 or .37, somewhere along there.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.840
His mother got sick and he was terminal.

08:17.260 --> 08:21.800
And Robert told his daddy, he says, I don't want to live after my mother's gone.

08:24.520 --> 08:30.960
And so when his mother died, he went out in the car and sat down and shot himself.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.420
Yeah.

08:41.260 --> 08:52.940
One of the things we've been trying, of course a lot of people have been trying to figure this out because Howard's become rather famous over the years, is why he would have done that.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.260
You probably knew him fairly well.

08:57.880 --> 09:02.260
Could you give any speculation as to why he would have gone out and shot himself and his mother back?

09:03.780 --> 09:04.740
I don't know.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.260
Like I say, my wife and I were in California at that time and we had lost contact with him.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.980
But Robert never married, he never seemed interested in girls.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.900
And he did have one girlfriend there and cross planes for a time.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.700
I'd see him out in the car driving around once in a while.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.640
But I don't think that lasted long.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.240
He was just wrapped up in his work writing those stories.

09:38.260 --> 09:44.480
And he had a last-hand back porch on the southeast side of the house there.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.120
And it wasn't too far from my mother's bedroom.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.780
And a lot of times at night he'd wake her up with that typewriter clock.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.740
You know, it was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.

09:57.920 --> 09:58.800
Some inspiration.

09:59.120 --> 10:04.500
He'd probably be laying there in bed and think of something and he'd get up and write it down right quick.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.280
And he just worked all the hours.

10:10.260 --> 10:14.440
You know, whenever he'd think of something he wanted to put in a story.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.100
Yeah, that's very interesting. That's very interesting.

10:22.860 --> 10:29.160
I don't know. I kind of wondered myself, you know, he did write a whole lot, uh, wrote it quickly.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.860
And I just kind of wondered if he was burning himself out.

10:34.820 --> 10:37.020
He could possibly have been.

10:38.780 --> 10:44.360
I remember the last time I saw him, which was long, about 1934, 1935.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.180
He seemed in good health.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.600
Yeah, about that last time you saw him, what do you remember about that?

10:58.460 --> 11:00.920
Well, nothing in particular.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.760
He was just, you know, I would say hello across the fence.

11:05.700 --> 11:06.620
Talk a few minutes.

11:09.580 --> 11:17.880
When we were still kids, Francis Bannerman and son was a big mail order house in New York

11:18.680 --> 11:26.420
that handled all kinds of armament and things from medieval times on up to modern.

11:27.040 --> 11:33.800
And we had ordered a couple of little, they weren't fencing swords in that sense.

11:33.980 --> 11:43.220
I don't know just exactly the name of them, but they had a round heel on them, you know, where you protect your hands.

11:43.980 --> 11:50.700
But we ordered those things and we'd get out in the backyard and wrap a bandana hat around our heads like a pirate.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.140
And we'd get out and fence with those things.

11:55.600 --> 12:01.440
Of course, we didn't dare, you know, hit each other with them because they were, they'd have gone through you.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.220
But we did that quite a bit.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.000
We had an immense live old tree in our backyard.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.180
We'd get out there and shade that old tree in.

12:14.100 --> 12:19.380
Pretend that we were back maybe in the dark ages or something.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.340
Or in the time of the Spanish man.

12:25.900 --> 12:26.960
Things like that.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.380
He had things like that on his mind all the time.

12:36.860 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, I just said, I just said sort of, uh, was how his imagination worked.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.340
He had a very vivid imagination.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.480
Yes, he did.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.480
Mm-hmm.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.480
Okay, let's see.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.140
Um, I have about covered all my questions here.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.180
I didn't want to take up too much of your time.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.480
He had some relatives in Ranger, Texas.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.580
Have you contacted anyone in Ranger?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.020
No, sir.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.980
There may be, they might have passed away by now.

13:16.900 --> 13:21.700
But, uh, he had some aunts, one or two aunts.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.820
I believe it was in Ranger.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.240
And they were the only heirs to the Howard Estate there.

13:29.940 --> 13:34.940
And they were up, up until, oh, two or three years ago.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.700
I think some of them were still living.

13:36.700 --> 13:42.180
I think he was still drawing relatives off of some of his stories that were still being published.

13:45.480 --> 13:51.520
Yeah, um, I've heard of them.

13:52.340 --> 13:55.100
We haven't, haven't attempted to talk with them.

13:55.500 --> 13:55.700
Yeah.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.760
But, um...

13:56.760 --> 13:58.920
I'm sure he camped, is that his name, DeCamp?

13:59.260 --> 13:59.620
Yes, sir.

14:00.100 --> 14:05.540
I'm sure he contacted them and you'd probably get all that information from him.

14:07.400 --> 14:07.880
Yeah.

14:13.240 --> 14:13.720
Um...

14:13.720 --> 14:20.640
And Jack Scott, of course, I know is your best authority there in Cross Plains, don't you, Robert?

14:21.200 --> 14:24.860
Yeah, I talked to Mr. Scott before. He was, uh, he was quite helpful.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.180
He recommended talking to Mr. Scott Baum.

14:29.780 --> 14:34.900
And Mr. Scott Baum said, well, he, he'd called the Roy Butler. He knew him too.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.560
So we've been kind of going, you know, from one to the other, to the other.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.220
I see. Uh-huh.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.280
And, uh, I think, I think we've probably got enough information here.

14:44.340 --> 14:50.800
We may, we may call Mr. Scott again to see if, uh, if, uh, we might get a little, if he's remembering anything else.

14:50.800 --> 15:01.140
Is this going to be, uh, probably a lot of publicity, or at least some publicity about Howard, uh, in conjunction with the movie that's coming out in the latter part of May?

15:01.380 --> 15:16.720
I do know this, that Robert, during the time of the Depression, you know, until his death, had the best income of anyone in Cross Plains,

15:16.720 --> 15:23.420
including the bankers from the school, the teachers, and all the other professions there,

15:23.720 --> 15:30.840
that Robert's income from his stories was bringing in more money than anybody else in Cross Plains would join.

15:35.300 --> 15:39.800
Yeah. Yeah, that, that, that's interesting.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.500
Not many than the bankers too, huh?

15:42.840 --> 15:43.740
Uh-huh.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.820
Nobody laughed at those stories, I bet.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.120
That's right.

15:51.240 --> 15:56.000
Alright, Mr. Butler, I, uh, I think I've covered anything. I sure do appreciate it.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.180
Well, you're quite welcome.
