00:11.260 --> 00:18.500
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.500 --> 00:20.740
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.260
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.660 --> 00:35.060
The subject of this program is Robert Heinlein.

00:36.260 --> 00:41.820
Robert Heinlein to many readers is science fiction. His first story, Lifeline, was published in

00:41.820 --> 00:47.720
1939 by John W. Campbell. He was followed by several short stories, many reflecting Heinlein's

00:47.720 --> 00:54.140
themes of longevity, revolution, and mysticism. In 1947 he started a series of juvenile novels

00:54.140 --> 00:59.240
which have greatly shaped the way people perceive science fiction today. The turning point for

00:59.240 --> 01:06.140
Heinlein's work was the publication of Starship Troopers in 1959. This was followed by possibly

01:06.140 --> 01:11.160
the first science fiction bestseller, Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein's work became

01:11.160 --> 01:14.720
increasingly mystical and dominated by his own moral and ethical views.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.760
His early work, I think, is probably what most people today remember him for. As you said, his

01:21.760 --> 01:27.680
first story was published in 1939. And that story and the ones that followed it were really based

01:27.680 --> 01:33.580
on the old pulp formulas in a lot of ways. They were gimmick stories, some of them. They were

01:33.580 --> 01:38.320
adventure stories, exploration stories. They were all fast-moving, they were entertaining,

01:38.320 --> 01:47.120
they were clever. Lifeline, for instance, has as its gimmick a machine that predicts,

01:47.960 --> 01:53.880
not predicts, I'm sorry, it actually states the moment of a person's death. And a certain Dr.

01:54.060 --> 02:00.920
Panero demonstrates the validity or the efficacy of this machine and predicts people's death.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.360
Of course, the insurance companies don't like this too well, so they initiate certain plots to get

02:07.360 --> 02:12.840
rid of him. And near the end of the story, he's assassinated. In addition to being a gimmick

02:12.840 --> 02:21.040
story, it's also got a clever ending. Panero, it seems, had scanned his own lifeline with this

02:21.040 --> 02:26.940
machine and had foreseen his own death by the insurance company plot, but of course,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
wasn't able to do anything about it because the machine always told the truth.

02:32.380 --> 02:38.740
In the story, Rhodes must roll, Heinlein extrapolated a future transport system that was rather unique.

02:39.380 --> 02:46.020
It was a series of conveyor belts, if you will, that were placed side by side, each one being a

02:46.020 --> 02:51.440
faster speed than the next one. A person could step onto a very slow-moving five mile an hour belt

02:51.440 --> 02:57.180
and progress his way inward until he was traveling at quite a high speed. These things were huge.

02:57.180 --> 03:03.060
They stretched all over the country, and I suppose the world with people building buildings,

03:03.140 --> 03:07.260
businesses on the inner strips that would just move all the time.

03:08.220 --> 03:14.860
Rhodes must roll was written in 1940, and Heinlein was inaccurate in predicting that private cars

03:14.860 --> 03:20.300
would go out of use in the highways. But he was rather accurate in predicting that transportation

03:20.300 --> 03:25.040
would be fairly well watched over by large and powerful monopolies, which they are now.

03:25.720 --> 03:32.680
The crux of the book or the story is that it's a conflict between the union or the workers and

03:32.680 --> 03:39.160
management and what types of services the roads will have and inadequacies and pay and other

03:39.160 --> 03:45.200
things along that same line. Another one of his early stories and considered a classic

03:46.220 --> 03:52.740
for its theme is by his bootstraps, published in 1941. And this is a time travel story. Heinlein

03:52.740 --> 03:57.660
covered time travel at various times in his career. This, I believe, was his first, and some

03:57.660 --> 04:04.000
people consider a classic of the form. But it's a brain-twisting story. Of course, when you talk

04:04.000 --> 04:09.600
about time travel, you're dealing with all sorts of paradoxes. And what Heinlein does in this story

04:09.600 --> 04:18.780
is to construct a plot whereby the main character plays all the roles. He's a young man. He goes

04:18.780 --> 04:24.560
back in time. He meets himself as an old man. He's obviously gone back in time before.

04:26.780 --> 04:33.060
And everybody he meets in the past is one aspect of himself when he had been in the past at previous

04:33.060 --> 04:41.580
times. It's very hard to follow because of the convoluted plot structure, the traveling through

04:41.580 --> 04:47.100
this time gate that allows him to emerge at various points in time. But it's still considered,

04:47.100 --> 04:53.740
as I said, a classic by some people. And Heinlein has used what has been termed cyclic time travel

04:53.740 --> 04:59.200
before, or at least he has used it since in other stories. This story, along with some of his other

04:59.200 --> 05:08.840
earlier ones, are based on a gimmick of some kind. Another one along these same lines, using an idea

05:08.840 --> 05:15.360
or a gimmick in it, is, and he built a cricket house. It's a very unusual and humorous short story

05:16.040 --> 05:23.240
concerning a fellow who builds a house in the form of an unfolded tesseract, or hypercube,

05:23.360 --> 05:29.940
a four-dimensional cube. This is a house that looks like four cubes stacked on top of each other with

05:29.940 --> 05:36.540
a cross cube on the second level up from the top. And he builds this thing in California,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.800
and there happens to be an earthquake one night, and the whole thing folds up. And now he has a

05:40.800 --> 05:45.180
four-dimensional house. When they enter it to find out what happened to the rest of the house,

05:45.600 --> 05:50.260
they aren't sure they think maybe someone came and took it away or something. They don't find any

05:50.260 --> 05:55.780
debris around it, however. But they go inside and look around and go up to where they think the

05:55.780 --> 06:00.580
roof is going to be, and it's another room. And they keep going up and up and up, and we get the

06:00.580 --> 06:05.580
top room and go up on what was the roof. They're back in the bottom room again. As they open windows

06:05.580 --> 06:12.680
and doors, they find all sorts of interconnections that are not proper in the three-dimensional

06:12.680 --> 06:18.020
universe in which we live. Eventually they open windows. One of them looks straight down the

06:18.020 --> 06:23.260
side of the Empire State Building, and as they're looking out, which is rather disconcerting,

06:23.920 --> 06:29.180
and another one looks upon a seascape, but it's upside down. Eventually they leave the house

06:29.180 --> 06:34.740
through one of the windows, thinking that they're on an alien planet, and actually they're just out

06:34.740 --> 06:41.860
into the Joshua Tree National Monument somewhere in the middle of California. Yeah, all of these

06:41.860 --> 06:47.620
early stories dealt with some kind of clever twist or gimmick, something of that nature, and they

06:47.620 --> 06:52.620
were very popular with the readers of Astounding, John W. Campbell's magazine. But Campbell, the

06:52.620 --> 06:59.000
editor of that publication, in 1941 noted that many of Heinlein's stories followed a consistent

06:59.000 --> 07:04.740
future. In other words, they would have certain development, certain people even,

07:05.940 --> 07:11.840
that could be found in more than one story. And he wrote a little article about that, calling

07:11.840 --> 07:15.300
the reader's attention to the fact that this author seemed to be writing what has come to be

07:15.300 --> 07:23.200
called a future history. And since then, Heinlein has added many stories, many novels, to his

07:23.200 --> 07:29.840
future history. And I think that, along with people like Paul Anderson and Larry Niven,

07:29.980 --> 07:36.360
other authors who have done the same kind of thing, that this is, I guess it's almost a

07:36.360 --> 07:41.320
rarity in science fiction, where an author will build an almost an entire future and follow it

07:41.320 --> 07:47.860
through a number of stories and novels. Lifeline and Rosemus roll two stories which we've already

07:47.860 --> 07:53.980
talked about are two of the stories in Heinlein's future history series. One of the ones following

07:53.980 --> 07:58.660
that was Blow Ups Happen, which accurately predicts some of the problems we're having now with nuclear

07:59.220 --> 08:05.580
waste and possibility of meltdown and nuclear and detonation of nuclear power plants.

08:06.400 --> 08:12.840
And all those stories dealt with things on this earth. They started his future history and they

08:12.840 --> 08:20.720
dealt with earthly matters. But very soon he went out into exploration. And his first stories in that

08:22.160 --> 08:28.840
area were the exploration of the moon. And one of his novels, The Man Who Sold the Moon, published in 1950,

08:29.420 --> 08:35.320
developed the theme of the exploration of the moon by private industry. Now, Heinlein sometimes can

08:35.320 --> 08:42.740
hit the future pretty carefully when he extrapolates, or pretty closely when he extrapolates. This time

08:42.740 --> 08:50.140
he seemed to be a little off in thinking that the moon would be explored, developed, exploited

08:50.700 --> 08:56.240
by industry or private business. But anyhow, the protagonist of that novel is a man named D.D.

08:56.420 --> 09:07.520
Harriman. And he's obsessed with exploring the moon and going to it, in fact, also. But he happens

09:07.520 --> 09:14.480
to be a man who uses all of his great resources to hire pilots, to build spaceships, to conduct the

09:14.480 --> 09:20.700
research and discover the technology necessary to get to the moon. And he's also a salesman, as a

09:20.700 --> 09:25.340
title indicates, the man who sold the moon. He conducts a great advertising campaign.

09:27.420 --> 09:34.760
Heinlein is noted for his detailed pictures of the future. And as Harriman tries to sell the moon

09:34.760 --> 09:42.140
to the public, you see all sorts of examples of why Heinlein's considered to be a finely detailed

09:42.140 --> 09:49.520
writer. For example, he sells the idea of advertising on the moon to a soft drink company.

09:50.400 --> 09:57.780
He convinces them that they can project a beam on the moon, which will reproduce the logo of their

09:57.780 --> 10:02.920
particular soft drink as a means of advertisement, and thereby gain money for his project.

10:04.760 --> 10:11.740
But Harriman is successful. He does get people to the moon. He does start to exploit it.

10:12.520 --> 10:18.760
And he has totally succeeded with what he set out to do. But earlier, he also, earlier than this,

10:18.900 --> 10:24.560
Heinlein had written a story called Requiem, which is actually a sequel to this story, but was written first.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.740
In Requiem, Harriman is able to outwit his heirs and eventually gets to the moon,

10:30.740 --> 10:35.580
although at the cost of his own life. The story is considered one of Heinlein's more powerful

10:35.580 --> 10:42.760
short stories in that it has a sort of wish fulfillment that almost any science fiction reader can identify with.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.080
Yeah, there's a sentimentality to that story, which is not always found in Heinlein.

10:47.700 --> 10:53.160
Usually, he's noted as a great realist. But here he has this old man who is almost ready for death.

10:54.140 --> 10:59.320
He knows he's going to die if he makes a trip to the moon. But yet he accepts it simply because

10:59.320 --> 11:05.440
he's always wanted to do that. It's not totally sentimental because he got what he wanted. He

11:05.440 --> 11:10.640
knew it was going to happen and there are no tears shed at the end of it. But still, it's a note of

11:11.400 --> 11:18.720
almost melodrama that's not usual in Heinlein's work. But very soon, he started to expand his

11:18.720 --> 11:22.920
future history into the solar system, the other planets, the asteroid belt, and so forth.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.800
And I think probably the collection of short stories known as the Green Hills of Earth

11:28.320 --> 11:35.660
would contain most of that material. The stories in that particular book deal with all sorts of

11:35.660 --> 11:44.940
themes, all sorts of human aspects of human nature as mankind expands throughout the solar system.

11:44.980 --> 11:50.620
For instance, Delilah in the Space Rigger is one of the first women's lived science fiction stories.

11:51.740 --> 11:56.820
And it's something which could have been written today, simply a story of the first woman who

11:56.820 --> 12:01.800
went out to work on a space station. She's at first not accepted by the men simply because

12:01.800 --> 12:07.060
she's a woman in the space as a man's world. But because of her courage, because of her ability,

12:07.920 --> 12:14.380
she comes to be accepted and simply becomes a space woman. The Green Hills of Earth,

12:14.620 --> 12:21.880
the title story of that volume, involves a blind bard of the spaceways named Riesling.

12:23.060 --> 12:28.380
He's gone through the solar system many times. He's blind because of radiation. But he's a singer,

12:28.580 --> 12:32.520
a bard. He makes up poems and songs and entertains the crews and they give him free rides.

12:33.640 --> 12:39.220
He loses his life as he saves the crew of one spaceship. And as he dies,

12:40.660 --> 12:46.220
locked in a room which contains radiation, he composes his last song,

12:46.760 --> 12:52.460
a beautiful ballad about the Green Hills of Earth. One other story, misfit, just to mention it

12:52.460 --> 12:57.280
briefly, introduces a character which later he picks up in Methuselah's Children, a man named

12:57.280 --> 13:06.260
Andrew Jackson Libby. He's almost a human calculator and has a few adventures and saves his

13:06.860 --> 13:10.260
fellow crew members and spacemen because of his amazing mental abilities.

13:24.140 --> 13:31.300
In 1941, he wrote a story known as Methuselah's Children, in which we meet the character Lazarus

13:31.300 --> 13:39.160
Long for the first time. According to the story, in 1974, an organization was formed to see if they

13:39.160 --> 13:46.600
could increase longevity in humans by genetic means. And this was done to a certain family of people.

13:47.760 --> 13:55.560
These people were able to live about three times longer than normal, I believe. And they had to

13:55.560 --> 14:01.960
maintain secrecy of this fact from the general public for fear that the public would not understand

14:01.960 --> 14:07.280
what they had done, would think that there was some kind of a special drug or device that would

14:07.280 --> 14:14.900
allow them to become long-lived themselves. So this family kept this a secret until it eventually

14:14.900 --> 14:21.820
got out. When it did become known, and of course they were in danger of their lives from the normal

14:21.820 --> 14:30.700
populace, they commandeered a spaceship and took off for deep space. They eventually came across

14:31.360 --> 14:35.280
a planet where they were going to try to settle, but there was an alien race that they contacted

14:35.280 --> 14:41.400
there that was so alien and so strange that they just simply couldn't handle it. They had to leave.

14:42.480 --> 14:49.320
They went to one other place, I believe, and then finally came back to earth to try to reconcile

14:49.320 --> 14:55.800
themselves with the human populace because they just couldn't hack being out in space as refugees

14:56.440 --> 15:02.900
forever. When they came back, here's the twist that is common to many of Heinlein's stories.

15:03.540 --> 15:10.060
The human race said that they left behind and found some sort of a way to become long-lived

15:10.060 --> 15:18.060
themselves and so that the whole escapade became academic. There are a couple things about that

15:18.060 --> 15:23.300
story that were interesting in addition to what you said, the spaceship, the interstellar craft

15:23.300 --> 15:27.300
that they commandeered to escape earth. I believe that was the first time Heinlein had taken any of

15:27.300 --> 15:32.000
his characters outside the solar system where they achieved interstellar flight, even though they did

15:32.000 --> 15:35.940
come back home. It was a successful journey in the sense they stayed out there and colonized.

15:36.980 --> 15:43.340
Also there's alien contact, of course, with the alien races. In Lazarus Long, I suppose, along with

15:43.340 --> 15:49.800
Michael Valentine Smith and Stranger in a Strange Land, he would be the most recognizable of Heinlein's

15:49.800 --> 15:55.360
main characters. There have been books published about Lazarus Long's sayings, his wisdom.

15:56.340 --> 16:00.500
Of course, he lived such a tremendous span of years that he would gain all sorts of wisdom and

16:00.500 --> 16:07.440
all kinds of little sayings and aphorisms were associated with him. But he was the head of

16:07.440 --> 16:12.640
his family, the Howard family, I believe it was called, that originally were the ones that had

16:12.640 --> 16:21.480
longevity. And he does turn up later in Heinlein's future history. Probably the end of the,

16:21.780 --> 16:26.340
the end chronologically, not so much the end as being the last book he wrote about it,

16:26.700 --> 16:32.120
but the end chronologically of his future history would occur in two short stories,

16:32.480 --> 16:39.270
both published in 1941, one entitled Universe and one entitled Common Sense. Later published his

16:39.270 --> 16:46.050
Orphans of the Sky, a novel. In Universe, we're shown a ship that is a slow boat or a generation

16:46.050 --> 16:53.890
ship taking a crew of humans to a far distant star so that they can begin life again. And this is a

16:53.890 --> 17:01.210
ship that moves so slow that the first people who boarded the ship would not live to, to see the

17:01.210 --> 17:06.640
end of the voyage. Their descendants would be the ones who would eventually reach the planet that

17:06.640 --> 17:12.800
they're aiming for. This has been in transit so long and things have happened over the years to

17:12.800 --> 17:17.380
the ship that the people on board have forgotten that it's even a ship. They live in the interior

17:18.140 --> 17:23.980
and for all that they know, that is the entire field of existence, the entire universe is that

17:23.980 --> 17:30.480
interior where they live and have their farms and houses and cities. The exterior portions of the ship

17:31.000 --> 17:37.680
are controlled by mutants who prevent the normal humans from reaching the exterior portions of

17:37.680 --> 17:45.580
the ship and thereby seeing the stars and exterior universe. Yeah, there's a great deal of animosity

17:45.580 --> 17:51.840
between the mutants and the regular humans. In fact, what they really have to do is combine forces

17:51.840 --> 17:56.900
before they can ever realize that this is a ship going somewhere and try to do something about it.

17:56.900 --> 18:01.600
The protagonist or the main character in that story is a strange creature. He's one of the

18:01.600 --> 18:08.180
mutants. He has two heads and he happens to convince one of the normal humans what he's found out.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.420
He has found out this two-headed mutant has found out that this is a ship they're on

18:11.420 --> 18:19.460
and he convinces one of the normal humans. And the story is optimistic. Even though these people

18:19.460 --> 18:25.460
have lost sight of who they are and where they're going, as the title indicates, they think their

18:25.460 --> 18:32.020
little ship is the universe. The story ends with the words, the two-headed mutant says to his friend,

18:32.280 --> 18:37.360
we've got to do it, you know, meaning tell the other humans they have to stop the ship,

18:37.480 --> 18:40.540
they have to get, well first of all get where they're going and then stop the ship.

18:42.180 --> 18:49.140
In the second part, common sense, this is what they do. They do convince the humans that they are

18:49.140 --> 18:58.900
on a ship, but complications ensue. Politics gets, comes into it. Power factions, petty jealousies,

18:59.400 --> 19:04.760
a lack of organization occur. And by the end of the story, common sense, only a few

19:05.600 --> 19:11.660
of the people on that ship do escape to the planet the ship had been aimed at generations and

19:11.660 --> 19:18.160
generations ago. But some people consider that the two stories together, entitled Orphans of the

19:18.160 --> 19:25.580
Skies and Oh, some people consider that book the classic of the generation ship or slow ship stories.

19:39.660 --> 19:46.320
Probably the turning point in Heinlein's stories was Starship Troopers written in 1959.

19:47.460 --> 19:53.000
The story was supposedly the last in a series of juvenile novels, which Heinlein was writing at

19:53.000 --> 19:59.480
the time, but it wasn't accepted by the publisher because of its, its content, specifically the

19:59.480 --> 20:09.280
way it treated war. The story briefly is about a young man, Juan Rico, who grows up and becomes

20:09.280 --> 20:14.380
part of the military service and then serving in the military service has various adventures on

20:14.380 --> 20:21.960
other planets. Rico learns the nature of war and its ends value, the need for discipline and a,

20:21.960 --> 20:29.780
and a philosophy of punishment, which some readers found very unusual. Anti-social behavior in the

20:29.780 --> 20:37.860
book is strictly limited and the whole society is very regimented. One of the main points that

20:37.860 --> 20:42.700
Heinlein wants to make in the novel is that if man had no challenge, he would tend to become complacent.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.320
Also another theme that you find in the story is that it's a success story, which is

20:47.820 --> 20:52.540
similar to many other of Heinlein's works. But also some readers, as you mentioned earlier,

20:54.260 --> 20:58.580
but the publishers, I think, which gave him a little trouble with the book, have seen it as very

20:58.580 --> 21:04.440
militaristic. Heinlein has been accused of many things, contradictory things. It's hard to pin him down.

21:05.080 --> 21:10.120
He's been called a fascist on the one hand, a liberal on the other, an anarchist on one hand,

21:10.120 --> 21:14.520
a militarist on the other. The novel viewed in a rather strict sense could be viewed as fascist,

21:14.660 --> 21:22.820
but it really isn't. Heinlein was a social Darwinist in that he believed that the strong would prevail.

21:23.740 --> 21:28.340
Another category of Heinlein's works that we might mention started with a novel,

21:28.480 --> 21:33.560
Rocket Ship Galileo in 1947. Heinlein's become rather well known for his juvenile novels,

21:33.840 --> 21:37.100
of which there are a number. Yeah, I think there were 13 juveniles and

21:37.860 --> 21:42.140
among the many barriers that Heinlein broke as a science fiction writer, one of them was the

21:42.140 --> 21:48.660
juvenile market. He was the first one to really pick up a public of juvenile readers. I believe

21:48.660 --> 21:54.620
it was Lester Del Ray, the critic who said that one of the greatest factors in the spread of

21:54.620 --> 22:00.520
science fiction or the importance of it today were the juvenile novels of Heinlein because the

22:00.520 --> 22:06.640
whole generation was brought up reading those books and that generation is now the readers,

22:06.640 --> 22:11.480
the writers, the editors, and so forth of science fiction. So they were sort of educated

22:11.480 --> 22:19.840
on Heinlein's juveniles. In his juvenile novels he covered many and various themes, very good

22:19.840 --> 22:25.820
action adventure novel, one of them being Starman Jones about a young Ozark farm boy who eventually

22:25.820 --> 22:34.000
becomes the captain of a starliner. A half-space suit will travel about a young man who wins a

22:34.000 --> 22:40.980
spacesuit in a contest and goes out and tries it on and is immediately picked up by aliens from

22:40.980 --> 22:45.880
another world and carried off to various adventures. Rocketship Galileo, which we already mentioned,

22:46.060 --> 22:53.040
which was made into a movie Destination Moon and Space Cadet, which inspired the TV series

22:53.040 --> 22:58.920
Tom Corbett Space Cadet. I think overall we might say that all of these juveniles,

22:59.460 --> 23:04.900
the main theme, one which would obviously appeal to the class of readers they reamed at,

23:05.180 --> 23:10.600
is sort of boy into man. You have an adolescent who undergoes various adventures, it matures him,

23:10.860 --> 23:15.760
it expands him, and he becomes a young man by the end of the book and that appealed of course to that

23:15.760 --> 23:26.360
class of reader. As you said before, the book Rocketship Galileo was the inspiration for the

23:26.360 --> 23:32.000
1950 working with Heinlein by the way, and it's recognized by movie critics and science fiction

23:32.000 --> 23:38.940
critics both as the initiator or the impetus for one of the greatest eras of science fiction films,

23:39.200 --> 23:44.640
the 1950s. Destination Moon really started that, it got the public interested in science fiction

23:44.640 --> 23:50.320
movies, it showed them they could be made intelligently. In the same year Kellogg's picked up

23:51.080 --> 23:56.080
Heinlein's novel Space Cadet and made it into Tom Corbett Space Cadet, a 15 minute program,

23:56.760 --> 24:02.300
which was seen nationwide and became extremely popular and went on for several years and it was

24:02.680 --> 24:05.940
a great innovator in special effects in the field of television.

24:08.480 --> 24:14.900
And of course Heinlein's recent books are very different than the ones he started off writing

24:14.900 --> 24:21.840
back in his future history days. Some readers don't like his recent books, they are different,

24:22.040 --> 24:27.280
they're avant-garde, they're liberal, they're controversial, they treat things like religion,

24:28.200 --> 24:37.640
sex, and all kinds of social institutions from a very strange viewpoint and probably Heinlein's

24:38.340 --> 24:43.880
best known book belongs to this category and that of course would be Stranger in a Strange Land

24:43.880 --> 24:50.700
published in 1961. Stranger in a Strange Land uses several themes which Heinlein has used throughout

24:50.700 --> 24:58.500
his works, one of them being a father figure or an educator which

25:00.620 --> 25:09.580
becomes aligned with a young man or young person and helps them over their problems with learning

25:09.580 --> 25:13.780
about new situations and new environments or what's happening to them as they grow up.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.500
Yeah, the protagonist of that book Michael Valentine Smith, he's called a Martian but he's

25:22.500 --> 25:28.080
really a human that's grown up on Mars, he's never known the earth, his parents have gone to Mars,

25:28.240 --> 25:33.220
the ship had not come back, they died, he'd been born right before they died on the planet Mars

25:33.860 --> 25:39.960
and he comes back to earth I think in his mid-twenties and he's been raised by the Martians, the old

25:39.960 --> 25:46.740
ones I believe they're called and he's got some extremely strange powers which illustrate Heinlein's

25:46.740 --> 25:56.060
occasional interest in a sort of a superman type, a superhuman type, a special leader with powers

25:56.060 --> 26:01.500
and insights and wisdom that the common people don't have and the novel is based upon the

26:01.500 --> 26:08.540
strange powers of this Michael Valentine Smith. The story starts off as an action adventure story

26:08.540 --> 26:13.640
where Michael Valentine Smith is rescued from the hospital in which he's recuperating from the

26:13.640 --> 26:23.500
flight back to earth, he's taken to his soon-to-be father figure Jubal Hershaw and Jubal sets about

26:23.500 --> 26:29.600
and educating Michael in the ways and customs of earth. What Heinlein does in that book is

26:30.360 --> 26:35.360
Michael Smith or Michael Valentine Smith becomes educated in earth ways, it gives Heinlein the

26:35.360 --> 26:42.000
opportunity to view earth, its institutions, its customs and so forth with the point of view of an

26:42.000 --> 26:47.960
outsider, you know even though Michael is a human being, he's a Martian, he's been raised by Martians

26:48.460 --> 26:55.440
so his responses to what he sees on earth, the social institutions, the religions and so forth

26:56.220 --> 27:01.700
form I think the center of the book and Michael soon gathers a group of people around him

27:02.240 --> 27:08.060
and they become his followers and I guess you'd start what he, I guess he starts what you'd call

27:08.060 --> 27:16.240
a religion based on on certain things that he has learned in his upbringing on Mars. He eventually

27:16.240 --> 27:24.400
teaches several of his followers how to also use these particular powers that he has and in order to

27:24.400 --> 27:31.060
use these abilities one has to grok or to know and completely holistically understand

27:31.920 --> 27:39.560
certain concepts about the universe and how it operates. This particular word grok was

27:40.240 --> 27:46.600
quite popular in the 60s, it became kind of a catch word for the people who had read the novel.

27:47.240 --> 27:51.420
Yeah that especially the character of Smith and the word grok and so forth

27:51.420 --> 27:55.600
sort of became the property of the so-called flower children, the hippies of the 60s.

27:55.860 --> 28:02.060
They really picked up on the book the idea of an outsider of someone who has new things to offer

28:02.060 --> 28:10.160
to society who wants change. The ideas that Highland put across with free love and sex and the

28:10.160 --> 28:16.280
novel also had a great deal to do with some of the changing mores in the 60s. Some people have seen a

28:17.240 --> 28:25.700
heavily symbolic value to Smith. He is killed by earth people who are afraid of his movement

28:26.300 --> 28:31.320
but he has the ability as taught to him by the old ones on Mars to overcome death,

28:32.320 --> 28:37.060
sort of a resurrection, not his physical body as such but a new state of being.

28:37.500 --> 28:42.300
And I think that some people see that as almost a Christ symbol. You have a leader with special powers,

28:43.120 --> 28:50.140
he gains followers, he dies but he's still there to inspire and inform them and teach them.

28:50.760 --> 28:56.380
He's been called the dean of science fiction. His works span the history of science fiction from

28:56.380 --> 29:02.380
pulp days to the present. He is still an important influence in the field and it's certain that

29:02.380 --> 29:05.780
science fiction would not be the same without Robert A. Heinlein.

29:13.540 --> 29:16.860
This is David Cruz. Darrell A. and David Carson.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin

29:22.900 --> 29:29.420
