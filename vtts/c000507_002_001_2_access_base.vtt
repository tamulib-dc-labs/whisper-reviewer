WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.160
Okay, tape is running again.

00:12.040 --> 00:15.600
I've carried the books that I think you've got published so far and I've come up with

00:15.600 --> 00:16.820
about 12 or 13.

00:17.080 --> 00:17.380
Is that right?

00:17.780 --> 00:19.320
I would imagine that's about right.

00:19.880 --> 00:23.520
Okay, I think I've read everything that you had out at the present time.

00:24.420 --> 00:27.080
My personal favorite is the faded centrology.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.460
You've only made one comment on that which sort of answered one of my questions, which

00:33.980 --> 00:35.020
is it pronounced them re?

00:35.380 --> 00:36.200
Re-re-re.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.500
If you'd modeled them in any culture, you've already answered that one.

00:43.900 --> 00:51.720
I guess what I'll ask you is, what do you as their creator or Duncan, the human who lives

00:51.720 --> 00:52.100
with them?

00:52.100 --> 00:54.180
What do you admire about them?

00:56.910 --> 01:02.300
I think that for one thing, I have about them re.

01:03.830 --> 01:07.040
I think I admire their steadfastness.

01:08.170 --> 01:19.240
Their ability to face time itself with tranquility in the sense that they can take the long

01:19.240 --> 01:27.540
view, which is a thing that is absolutely necessary in my mind for civilized survival.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.940
Mine, I don't say just survival, but civilized survival.

01:31.480 --> 01:37.440
Is their ability to look down the centuries and see consequences?

01:39.560 --> 01:42.660
The recent of time is a very strange thing.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.420
The memory always lives now.

01:46.280 --> 01:52.620
That now is a composite of the past, current events, and the future simultaneously.

01:54.490 --> 02:02.420
They do not view time as the modern American does, which is more or less a set of beads

02:02.420 --> 02:07.980
on the string that we can snip off any tail of the string that seems inconvenient to us.

02:07.980 --> 02:21.640
The reconcept of the universe is holistic and their ability to perceive that all of time

02:21.640 --> 02:24.020
impacts on every moment that they live.

02:24.840 --> 02:33.140
I think it's one of the things that I most enjoy about that species.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.680
What about Duncan?

02:35.680 --> 02:40.500
Why does he choose to give up his humanity and become one of them?

02:41.780 --> 02:53.560
The character of Duncan himself, he was born in the war probably in orphan, very early

02:53.560 --> 03:02.920
in life, transferred to a state nursery and brought up to fight, essentially to pay for

03:02.920 --> 03:09.100
his existence by becoming a soldier in a war that had gone on much longer than made

03:09.100 --> 03:09.980
sense for anyone.

03:12.140 --> 03:18.100
When he encountered the Marie, he is a very simple man in many ways.

03:18.480 --> 03:25.140
He's highly educated in his narrow field of specialization, the states, all the rest.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.100
But when he encounters the Marie, he cannot sympathize with the diplomats with anything

03:32.100 --> 03:33.200
else that's going on.

03:34.220 --> 03:41.460
But what he considered to be another soldier from his viewpoint, with a soldier's morality,

03:42.740 --> 03:51.120
he could comprehend and respect that, that respect then led him to a deeper understanding

03:51.120 --> 03:51.720
of the people.

03:53.620 --> 04:00.280
To me, one of the more pathetic things in the story is Duncan himself who is attacking

04:00.280 --> 04:07.900
the Regal Library, attempting a completely uneducated man in many ways, attempting to

04:07.900 --> 04:11.340
understand the culture that he has just contributed to destroying.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.940
And he becomes obsessed with it.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.060
He finally conceives it as a moral responsibility of his own.

04:22.480 --> 04:29.960
And thereby falls into a trap because his humanity, his sense of moral responsibility,

04:29.960 --> 04:37.140
his feeling of blame for what has happened, leads him to attempt to save these people.

04:38.600 --> 04:50.600
And once he has done that, he discovers that if he remains what he is, namely human, that

04:50.600 --> 04:56.100
will effectively destroy them as any bomb, any attack could do.

04:58.440 --> 05:11.440
So his final sacrifice in a sort of a redemptive sense is that he finally agrees that he won't

05:11.440 --> 05:14.620
no longer attempt to be human.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.720
And he begins to try to be something else.

05:18.360 --> 05:24.120
Even in that, there is a considerable hazard because if the transition is not complete,

05:25.000 --> 05:30.620
he may end up by contaminating the culture, which to the Marie and their way of life is

05:30.620 --> 05:31.960
a very, very serious thing.

05:32.660 --> 05:40.440
But it is a voluntary and conscious decision that is effectively a disbursement suicide.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.180
And he takes it because he goes from the point of what has happened.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.200
Okay.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.780
I think it was in the second book of the series.

05:52.780 --> 05:59.620
There was a particular episode that I guess the volume writing is this, I think that to

05:59.620 --> 06:00.140
me the most.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.320
Is the game called Shonai?

06:03.000 --> 06:03.420
Shonai.

06:04.680 --> 06:04.900
Shonai.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.320
When I want to shit, making the jumps back to the Marie-Horn world.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.800
And I guess it's Nayunas or Niyunas teaching him the Shonai game.

06:15.520 --> 06:20.500
I was fascinated enough about that to wonder if there was any modern behind that particular

06:20.500 --> 06:22.420
game and its purpose or its intention.

06:26.060 --> 06:30.720
I suppose that if I thought very far back into my childhood I could think of games that

06:30.720 --> 06:31.600
I played that were similar.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.680
With them games, games of coordination.

06:37.420 --> 06:43.120
The game to the Marie is a form of literature.

06:44.540 --> 06:48.380
It contains the relationships of the people.

06:49.600 --> 06:55.020
And as such, I suppose the great deal of it was made up completely out of whole clock.

06:55.840 --> 07:07.500
Because from simply the initial thought of a rhythm game, the original concept that I

07:08.160 --> 07:11.180
had it was simply a rhythm or a champ.

07:12.240 --> 07:20.080
And beyond that, the concept grew as my understanding of the Marie increased just by working with

07:20.080 --> 07:21.580
that sort of culture.

07:22.780 --> 07:29.740
Until I began to realize that if you're playing this thing as dangerously as they play it,

07:30.900 --> 07:36.500
that it's going to make a great deal of difference in terms of the weaknesses and strengths of

07:36.500 --> 07:36.940
the players.

07:37.900 --> 07:45.020
It's going to have a great deal to say about the interdependencies and independences,

07:45.040 --> 07:51.360
if you will, of the individuals within the community who can play with whom, who sets

07:51.360 --> 07:54.460
up the whom, who is alive to whom.

07:55.940 --> 08:04.180
And it also has to do with the philosophy of the people, which again has to do with the

08:04.180 --> 08:11.540
great now, the ability to turn loose of the thing and to live for the moment, which stretches

08:11.540 --> 08:21.180
in all directions in time, to as Neon puts it open the hand and let's go, which is one of

08:21.180 --> 08:23.020
the hardest things that Duncan has to learn.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.960
Okay, remember a question in those books.

08:29.460 --> 08:33.020
It seemed to me that you did leave them opening at the end of the third volume, and I wanted

08:33.020 --> 08:36.140
to ask if you perhaps could have any plans to continue with Marie.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.560
Yes, there is a possibility of that.

08:41.940 --> 08:50.380
I had to work so intensely with that culture for quite a while that I do not at present trust

08:50.380 --> 08:53.580
myself to tamper with it.

08:55.720 --> 09:00.540
I think that like the more game book, there is a possibility of my going back and working

09:00.540 --> 09:01.200
with it again.

09:02.060 --> 09:08.100
As a matter of fact, I already have sort of the germ of an idea, but it will have to get

09:08.100 --> 09:09.420
a mosque for quite a while.

09:10.940 --> 09:16.480
I want to make sure that if I disturb them again, it's for a worthy cause.

09:18.540 --> 09:24.520
Not just to write a book to be a sequel, but to be sure that it is a kind of story

09:24.520 --> 09:26.300
that could only be told with Marie.

09:27.180 --> 09:30.540
That's one of the penalties working with cultures.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.800
You lose the ability to say, well, I would like to write a story, and I think I will write

09:36.800 --> 09:38.260
a story with these people.

09:39.320 --> 09:46.740
When the story is that I told us is round as deeply into the culture and history of a species

09:46.740 --> 09:53.840
as the faded sun was, you have to come up with another kind of story which could only

09:53.840 --> 09:55.140
be told about that culture.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.500
Okay, let me round around one more work.

10:02.260 --> 10:06.720
What was the impetus behind the short stories in the book, Sam Fallow?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.820
It's so different than the other things you've done.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.500
I wondered what was behind that.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.540
Well, it's different perhaps than other things which have come to life.

10:15.820 --> 10:19.100
But I think that I travel the great deal about the world.

10:19.740 --> 10:26.020
I've been in, well, let me think, I've been to Rome and to London.

10:27.740 --> 10:31.020
I've never been in Paris, actually, but I've been all over France.

10:35.220 --> 10:40.080
And East Ambulance, which didn't make it in, I was going to do an East Ambulance story.

10:41.080 --> 10:45.100
And maybe yet, I've never been to Beijing either.

10:45.680 --> 10:54.920
But basically, I began thinking about the organism of a city as an entity.

10:56.380 --> 11:01.720
The concept of a city having a personality different than all other things.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.880
You go to New York and you could not mistake it for Rome.

11:09.120 --> 11:13.680
It's just a composite of people living there gives it a different flavor.

11:13.960 --> 11:19.620
A different case, a different style than any other place.

11:21.620 --> 11:26.460
Also, to a certain extent, I suppose it's psychologically related to the faded sun.

11:27.900 --> 11:39.840
Because when I was thinking about another species at the end of time, I wondered what about our own, what about the Earth when we're very, very old.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.800
What sort of thing might we preserve as our artifacts?

11:44.760 --> 12:00.220
And the idea occurred to me that one of the things that humanity has created, which for all we know maybe unique, humanity, is this concept we call city.

12:01.940 --> 12:15.360
And consequently, the story arose with the cities differentiating from each other to such an extent that we return to the age of the city state.

12:16.140 --> 12:25.620
Civilization is slowly being cancelled just because of the interval of distance, time and the difference of culture over the years.

12:28.040 --> 12:38.620
So the idea behind that book would have been conceived before you wrote the short stories or did you write the short stories individually and then think of a way to put them together.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.140
Well, actually, the initial story in the whole piece was the Rome story.

12:44.880 --> 12:58.100
George Siddharz then with Isaac Ebbath as a magazine had shown the cover, which contained a fantastical number of elements.

12:59.340 --> 13:04.860
And sort of on a bad-ass case, I could write a short story based on that.

13:05.340 --> 13:11.220
Because back in the old age, you know, writers did use to write stories that the covers rather than the other way around.

13:12.880 --> 13:19.140
So I undertook it and George's comment on the story was about that.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.940
Most editors make on my short stories, which was this seems to be connected to something else.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.980
Now, probably the affliction of novel of stews.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.880
But I wrote that one in a lay about a while.

13:33.600 --> 13:40.900
And then, you know, at the world conventions, they're always asking you to do readings from your work and I didn't have one.

13:41.500 --> 13:49.320
So I sat down and wrote the only death in the city as sort of inspired for the Rome story.

13:50.580 --> 13:55.760
And that one said in Paris, so that I had something to read at the world convention, which I did.

13:56.920 --> 14:01.360
Then it suddenly struck me that I had two stories, which were obviously connected to something else.

14:01.820 --> 14:13.580
And finally, it dawned on me that I could do several more of them since they were of an untidy link and I actually have a book.

14:16.260 --> 14:32.220
So out of all that broth of thinking about the world, all they each and the character of cities and the fact that I had two of them in hand, why I sat down and wrote several of them right in the string one after the other.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.260
Okay. I got the impression of some of those stories.

14:37.700 --> 14:43.880
For instance, the Paris one in the Moscow one that you may have consciously been minding them on the Faulttail method.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.520
They seem very much like a Faulttail or a Faulttail to me almost.

14:48.880 --> 14:55.020
It wouldn't be surprising because I've done a great deal of working this.

14:55.020 --> 15:11.020
I also personally couldn't believe that Faulttails are a fairly accurate form of preserving the group consciousness of the people.

15:11.280 --> 15:23.260
The re-caling of them through the centuries, everybody adds their own demeanor, their own layer of experience so that some of our very old stories acquire more and more significance as the older they get.

15:23.260 --> 15:33.480
That Cinderella being a good case in point which has been changed in practically every century, has been retold to fit the current myth of.

15:33.580 --> 15:45.300
In the Paris one, I think that I was not consciously drawing on any single fairy tale that I can think of.

15:46.220 --> 15:54.400
In the Russian one, definitely, I don't know frankly, I don't know very much about Moscow.

15:54.780 --> 16:00.840
I literally had to look up a city plan to find out what it was like.

16:01.520 --> 16:06.380
I had to look up about Old Moscow and to see how far it's stretched.

16:08.500 --> 16:15.920
Probably what the first settlement was where the first building stood and why and all of this sort of thing.

16:16.800 --> 16:25.580
I wanted to determine that and I began thinking back on all the quintessential Russian stories that I'd ever heard, most of which seemed to involve roles in one form or another.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.680
I thought of the character of the land.

16:30.240 --> 16:51.100
I have studied Russian. I have taken the Russian language so that I know something about the literature and I know something about the interrelations of the words, what concepts related to other words and what words are psychologically important within the language.

16:51.940 --> 16:56.380
So I just stirred all that together and came out with the Moscow story.

16:58.340 --> 17:07.000
Okay, in the observation of the question on that book, you didn't have in mind any echo of the diner of the earth.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.620
Did you, were the earth is living its last days and the various cultures on it or at their end?

17:12.340 --> 17:24.040
Well, I would say that was unconscious of it. The diner of the earth is something I read so long ago that I think that I'm almost ready to reread it as I do things which I enjoy a great deal.

17:26.420 --> 17:33.060
Having forgotten some of the salient details of it, so deeply that I think that now again I can enjoy it.

17:33.680 --> 17:40.920
As I did the first time I do recall that I liked it a great deal that I cannot for the life of me remember exactly what went on in it.

17:42.800 --> 17:56.000
Which is the kind of reader I am when I really am loving a book I begin to attempt to blur it in my mind and forget it as rapidly as possible so that I can have the pleasure of rereading it within a year or so.

17:58.740 --> 18:18.860
But I think that some of the influences on my writing in later periods than the first ones that I named have been Jack Vance and Fritz Labour.

18:19.580 --> 18:25.960
And so on and I don't think that one can remain unaffected by those ideas.

18:27.120 --> 18:37.900
They have both of those writers have written on topics that I'm very fond of which is the urban community in fantasy.

18:39.020 --> 18:46.660
So often fantasy puts one lone barbarian wandering off across an icy landscape coping with what comes.

18:47.620 --> 18:58.800
But the urban community in fantasy is the province of those two writers in particular that I think of at the moment.

18:58.800 --> 19:04.620
And definitely they have had their influence on whether subconscious or direct.

19:05.300 --> 19:24.040
I did receive a very kind letter from Fritz Labour who was kind enough to say that he had read Sunfall and we shared some feelings for cities.

19:29.520 --> 19:37.420
One thing also that has impressed me a great deal over the work that has been out that I read of yours is the flexibility of your style.

19:38.440 --> 19:43.500
And I read it if you consciously work at a particular style for a particular book.

19:44.400 --> 19:49.440
Sometimes if you change it, do you alter anything in terms of the story and the kind of book you're writing?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.720
I suppose that that has to do with being a bit of a linguist.

19:55.260 --> 20:08.260
There's also the fact that I have to sprate myself with writing conduct electronic examiner or virtual students with what I mean.

20:10.120 --> 20:16.420
And in some books I do allow myself to slip into a little bit more poetic style.

20:17.400 --> 20:22.840
It also seems to me that one style should be appropriate to the story that one is telling.

20:23.880 --> 20:36.160
So that if you're telling a story about nomads whose very means of expression is going to be perhaps figurative and poetical.

20:36.160 --> 20:43.280
Then you can do this sort of thing in the faded sense for instance the styles very radically from chapter to chapter.

20:43.520 --> 20:59.300
According to whether I happen to be dealing with the rather well the nomadic culture of the Marie or whether I'm dealing with the human who tends to be very narration background tends to be much more stark and efficient.

21:01.020 --> 21:11.700
I've worked in gear fantasy stories where I've looked at the language myself and looked back on it and thought oh my goodness I think I've been writing it with them again.

21:13.980 --> 21:20.400
I have it which I try to cure myself because I do try to write prose.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.160
In down below station the style varies again.

21:27.140 --> 21:34.140
That is I think fairly well modern style.

21:35.260 --> 21:39.380
And I guess that I just view it as a part of the composition.

21:41.380 --> 21:52.920
For instance if I were doing a portrait as an artist I think I would automatically tend to fall into a style in my drawing and my painting.

21:54.500 --> 21:59.540
Rather than trying to be a cubist or a pointalist or whatever.

21:59.540 --> 22:09.280
And it's the same way with my handling of words if I'm talking on a subject that is itself old.

22:09.680 --> 22:15.100
In my style is different than one in which I'm talking about computers unless I'm making a point.

22:16.720 --> 22:27.140
If I were for instance talking about a computer as a vehicle of prophecy I might deliberately fall back into an older mode of expression relating it back to deliathy or something.

22:28.720 --> 22:40.660
While I find that's one of the hardest things in the world in writing secrets is because my mode of expression changes also with time.

22:41.980 --> 22:47.380
It's very very difficult for me to go back and to recapture the language of a particular book.

22:48.180 --> 22:52.220
I have to reread it myself several times to fall back into that mode of expression.

22:54.260 --> 22:55.820
You know what I imagine I would be true.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.880
That sort of brings up another question I was going to ask you on.

23:04.540 --> 23:16.020
When you start to write a book do you see entirely plot the thing out and have it fixed and then simply put it on paper or do you just get in the moon and just let it come out whatever comes.

23:17.360 --> 23:25.880
There's only one book that I've written straight through from beginning to end. Well maybe two.

23:27.060 --> 23:34.220
I did a number of false starts I have about 10 to 15 different beginnings for date of Israel.

23:34.220 --> 23:42.540
After it gets beyond chapter five then everything proceeds like a straight line to the end.

23:43.380 --> 23:47.380
Many of the later chapters are written first draft which is very unusual for me.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.060
Eight drafts is not unusual in the book.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.400
The paper I generate is really phenomenal.

23:56.400 --> 24:06.140
I have filled a, I could literally fill a personal basket without taking some most novels.

24:07.500 --> 24:16.520
But the one that I did write originally from start to finish without a glitch was way without a shore.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.760
That one I just started the chapter one and pardon me.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.480
And it's from chapter one to the very end.

24:25.600 --> 24:33.680
It was virtually all first draft and I think I went through three.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.400
And that was it.

24:38.300 --> 24:41.560
Most of the others I find that I don't even start at the beginning of the book.

24:41.560 --> 24:48.080
What is now chapter eight in the faded sun started out as chapter one and so on.

24:48.400 --> 24:53.660
Like my literary idol Virgil I can write in both directions at once.

24:54.340 --> 25:05.560
So it begins at a point in action which makes sense to me and then I discover that I have to build back of that to explain how everybody got into the situation that I visualized at the beginning.

25:09.120 --> 25:09.480
Okay.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.540
I think I know the answer to this or I could suspect it.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.560
I'm going to ask it anyhow.

25:16.020 --> 25:23.280
Your use of when you set up an alien culture the term, the language that you make up for.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.860
For instance, in the hunter of warrants I think you did it more extensively.

25:25.860 --> 25:27.060
They're the most other places.

25:28.200 --> 25:35.240
Are you using any kind of language structure or any any kind of language uses a background for that?

25:35.240 --> 25:39.100
Or just your own knowledge of linguistics that allows you to make that up?

25:39.160 --> 25:44.280
I consciously try to make it easy on the reader.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.000
Some readers I suppose may be not.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.080
But I truly do.

25:50.540 --> 25:54.480
I will, for instance, try to keep related words.

25:57.280 --> 26:04.100
At least resembling one another closely enough that a person can figure out well.

26:04.100 --> 26:08.000
All this is something to do with, say, love or fight.

26:08.840 --> 26:19.320
Having seen a similar configuration before and if they miss it a little bit in terms of saying romance versus combat or something like that, at least they're in the ballpark.

26:21.320 --> 26:28.020
I do try to be kind also in not having words which aren't related starting with the same letter.

26:28.020 --> 26:32.740
So I do some things which are designed for kindness to the reader.

26:35.280 --> 26:51.180
Likewise, when I'm dealing with alien names I try to avoid having two or three aliens with very similar names which can be very, very confusing because there are many people who do not read phonetically and this could be a problem to them.

26:51.340 --> 26:54.600
So I'll try to have them start at different points of the alphabet.

26:57.020 --> 27:03.440
Contra of worlds is constructed for different reasons.

27:03.460 --> 27:09.360
Usually when I use alien languages in a book it is not for local color.

27:09.660 --> 27:20.700
It's just that when you run across anybody's civilization which is vastly different than your own you're going to come across three or four words which cannot be translated no matter how you would like to.

27:21.560 --> 27:27.380
It's just that not all languages have words for concepts.

27:29.660 --> 27:35.780
Well, you know, like in English you can take several things that you can say that you can't say in French and vice versa.

27:37.340 --> 27:42.820
Which is why language borrow words from other languages.

27:43.300 --> 27:57.520
When I did hundred of world I was doing something totally different and it is an experimental novel and it is not a novel that I recommend to someone who is not used to science fiction or not used to language one or the other.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.620
Basically on that one the very premise of the book is linguistics.

28:04.360 --> 28:14.300
Treating the science of linguistics as you will as seriously as you treat physics in a science fiction novel.

28:15.580 --> 28:21.520
I deliberately set out to make a language which is not based on any earthly model.

28:22.020 --> 28:32.860
I even changed the rules of grammar to something that as far as I know is not directly based on any grammatical system on the face of the earth.

28:34.740 --> 28:41.200
The thing is explained in a appendix in the back for people who wish to do this kind of thing.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.100
There are several ways to read the book.

28:46.900 --> 28:52.680
The recommended one is as the viewpoint character sees it.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.840
Frankly, the viewpoint character is confused.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.340
I'll get out most of the time. He doesn't understand.

29:00.080 --> 29:05.720
You can equally well appreciate the book simply by realizing it from his viewpoint.

29:06.460 --> 29:10.180
A lot of these people are speaking things that he and no rise can't do.

29:11.680 --> 29:17.920
The cover book is that of course the point he's vastly mistaken about what he thinks he understands.

29:20.080 --> 29:35.460
The book does have some good balls in it for somebody who is accustomed to believing everything that the hero in a novel believes must ergo be the truth.

29:36.140 --> 29:54.700
He is very, very frequently mistaken or very, very frequently except a concept which is not the whole concept and gradually begins to arise and understand what's going on toward the end of the book.

29:54.940 --> 30:01.120
I must go on everyone that even at the end he is somewhat mistaken.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.220
That would take a little more thought.

30:05.620 --> 30:06.800
I think it worked in some of the others.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.300
Let me change direction one more time.

30:13.940 --> 30:16.740
I don't know if you think about these things.

30:16.740 --> 30:23.900
Do you have a definition of science fiction?

30:25.500 --> 30:30.260
I think the best one ever came up with Roger Zalazni's definition, at least I believe it is.

30:30.460 --> 30:32.980
From whom he may have gotten it.

30:33.600 --> 30:39.500
It basically did if I ever discover a definition of science fiction, I shall immediately attempt to violate it.

30:40.560 --> 30:47.660
The science fiction to me is a will always remain an experimental literature.

30:48.280 --> 30:58.540
It does not have rules except to try to adhere to science and to prove things as much as possible and to try to have your research well-founded.

30:59.720 --> 31:05.200
At least the best possible understanding of what's going on that you can't worry about.

31:06.300 --> 31:13.760
To me science fiction is the same thing that the unknown writer of the Kilka Mesh epic did.

31:14.900 --> 31:20.180
A boy in search of the unknown, the sort of literature.

31:20.820 --> 31:23.020
It's the oldest kind of literature in the world.

31:25.940 --> 31:30.280
Frankly, I thought you modern mainstream fiction is an aberration.

31:31.480 --> 31:36.500
I largely brought on by a culture shock with the advent of the machine age.

31:38.180 --> 31:52.480
I think that it was sort of a reaction by a literary establishment that was not technologically educated and was in many instances not equipped to understand what was going on in the world.

31:54.040 --> 32:15.560
They retreated into a rather unrealistic form of literature which really attempted to either ignore the transformation into taking place in human society or having seen it or trying to deal with it could see no answer for it.

32:16.390 --> 32:33.100
My view of science fiction is that it is the cultural mainstream of Western literature and Eastern literature as well in many forms.

32:33.970 --> 32:41.200
And that it's a different in spirit or in type than the old epic.

32:42.820 --> 32:51.300
Epics are essentially literature of migration and man-kind is presently contemplating a rather large one.

32:53.340 --> 32:58.300
Could you tell me what you think draws people to science fiction right so popular?

32:59.040 --> 33:07.480
I think the same thing that is always drawn to all of the aforementioned curiosity.

33:08.580 --> 33:14.020
It's a wish to be in touch with one's environment, one's real environment.

33:16.840 --> 33:27.000
There are so many people who go through their daily lives concerned only with what happens in the office and what happens around them.

33:28.300 --> 33:35.080
And it's sort of like being locked in one cell if you never see beyond that.

33:36.360 --> 33:49.900
Nature and the universe have so much more to it than what you perceive if you limit your vision to your immediate time and your immediate place and your immediate circumstance.

33:53.480 --> 34:01.780
The new, the certain ability in ordinary daily affairs, I do not deny that.

34:02.440 --> 34:13.500
But I think the real understanding of what actually goes on in this ordinary daily affairs only comes to a wider understanding of the universe's home.

34:14.380 --> 34:34.740
And this is what I think draws people to science fiction to fantasy, to this whole vast realm of a romantical or positive way of looking at the universe which has been in the mainstream of all of the literature began.

34:37.400 --> 34:42.480
Okay, maybe you've answered this already, maybe I'm just restating the question, but let me ask it anyhow.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.880
Do you think science fiction has a particular value for its readers?

34:50.100 --> 34:52.180
I could not hear the last part of that question.

34:53.040 --> 34:58.500
But would you say that science fiction had a particular value? Is it a valuable thing for its readers?

34:59.600 --> 35:07.340
Yes, I would say that the value of science fiction is essentially the broadening of vision.

35:09.080 --> 35:16.020
The broadening of vision in time because we do not really concern ourselves only with the future.

35:17.240 --> 35:29.720
This is why fantasy, which deals with past ages, has been quite as comfortable in associating science fiction as it has.

35:30.780 --> 35:36.960
On the one hand, it should seem very strange to find fantasy readers and science fiction readers trading books.

35:37.620 --> 35:39.800
We think that we had nothing to say to each other.

35:41.260 --> 35:45.540
But in point of fact, we have all the world to say to each other.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.620
We have all of human experience to say to each other.

35:49.320 --> 35:59.740
We have the long view, one sort of being the memory of mankind and the other being the hope and the aspiration of where we will go and what we will do.

36:00.960 --> 36:06.480
Two sides of the same coin are as we would put it apart of the great now.

36:08.100 --> 36:16.260
It's a kind of literature that ripens the experience beyond one's daily life.

36:17.400 --> 36:33.600
It shows us the true size of the earth, the true size of the universe, the true importance of our travels, both the size and complexity of them and sometimes the extreme simplicity of them.

36:34.540 --> 36:50.260
It gives us perspective in dealing with the world around us and with each other and shows us that we have in many instances that we are more in common than we do in difference.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.880
Okay, that's excellent. Thank you very much.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.840
I don't have very much more to ask you just a couple more.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.560
Yeah, David, what are you drawing out on us? Are you okay on that end?

37:05.440 --> 37:05.620
Yeah.

37:06.140 --> 37:06.320
Okay.

37:09.820 --> 37:14.160
I guess really sort of a two-prong question.

37:14.160 --> 37:22.680
Maybe I wonder which of your books are the most popular in terms of sales, your best sellers and also maybe in terms of fan response?

37:24.820 --> 37:32.680
It's very difficult to judge this because I'm fairly young as a writer goes.

37:33.480 --> 37:40.160
My work's have only been out now for what six years, something like that.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.500
And sales figures are still coming in.

37:44.620 --> 37:48.300
So the only thing I can tell you is the oldest books have sold the most.

37:49.680 --> 37:56.600
And there does seem, if you compare sales figures to be some next celebration in it.

37:56.600 --> 38:03.740
Also, there must be a remarkable number of people that having read one are going for the others.

38:04.020 --> 38:10.220
I hope that this is the case because the sales figures seem to be remarkably similar.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.600
In terms of...

38:17.000 --> 38:22.660
Well, there's been some books that I've noticed that have caught on a little more slowly, like Hunter.

38:22.660 --> 38:31.980
I think that perhaps it took a little bit of readers getting used to me before they were ready to be all the time to the world.

38:34.200 --> 38:39.660
But in general, I would say that the sales have been fairly well, fairly well even.

38:40.520 --> 38:48.560
Or if they were not even, they tend to become more and more even.

38:51.860 --> 38:55.800
Which I think has also helped with the fact that all my books are in current issue.

38:56.820 --> 38:59.680
And if one likes one, one can find the others.

39:03.640 --> 39:11.440
So about the other, it's kind of curious again time plays a part of that.

39:12.480 --> 39:20.340
The more game books, the Gate trilogy does attract a great deal of male response in AIL.

39:21.860 --> 39:31.320
In the sense that possibly because it is a finished story, and there was a great deal of love it, and possibly people spent a great deal of time with it.

39:32.040 --> 39:36.400
Also the fact that I think fantasy people are great letter writers.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.700
I do get quite a lot of male on that.

39:46.180 --> 39:49.140
It also seems to provoke Spanish art.

39:50.360 --> 39:59.320
I've seen a great number of very beautiful renditions of the characters from that book, which again may say something about the...

39:59.320 --> 40:01.420
You know what people's favorite may be.

40:03.980 --> 40:11.360
But then it's got a lot of things that are really nice to draw like horses and medieval armor and this sort of thing.

40:13.960 --> 40:17.840
And I also get a great deal of male about the faded son trilogy.

40:19.240 --> 40:24.080
And a great deal of interest in that one.

40:25.900 --> 40:28.240
So the two longer ones.
