00:08.920 --> 00:12.880
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.320
And here are your hosts.

00:43.020 --> 00:45.160
This is Daryl Aind and David Cruz.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.040
There are a number of awards given to writers of science fiction and fantasy.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.180
The two best known awards are the Hugo and the Nebula, both given annually.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.480
But the winners are selected in very different manners.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.920
The Hugo is voted on by people attending the World Science Fiction Convention each year,

01:00.100 --> 01:02.660
so the selecting body would be made up mostly of fans.

01:03.300 --> 01:07.080
And the Nebula is voted on only by members of the Science Fiction Writers of America,

01:07.440 --> 01:08.840
in other words, the writers themselves.

01:09.540 --> 01:10.800
The Hugo is the oldest award.

01:11.340 --> 01:15.840
It was first given in 1953, and today there are a number of categories a writer can win in.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.160
He can win for a novel, a novella, a novelette, or a short story.

01:20.560 --> 01:25.280
And there are also hugos for movies, artists, editors, fan publications, and so forth.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.980
The Nebula began in 1966, so it's a more recent award.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.280
It's given each spring that the annual banquet of the Science Fiction Writers of America.

01:33.700 --> 01:39.720
And that body consists of around 500 people, so the voting base for the award is much smaller than it is for the Hugo.

01:40.340 --> 01:44.880
We asked one science fiction author, Jack Chalker, which award was the most prestigious?

01:46.200 --> 01:51.080
The Hugo, because it's been around now so long, and it's had so much publicity,

01:51.920 --> 02:01.560
and it's been so well promoted by the industry, is generally recognized by the regular Science Fiction Bookline public.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.700
Most of whom do not know how the Hugo is actually given.

02:06.740 --> 02:13.940
The fact is that I remember one Hugo winner who said that when she got on the train to go home,

02:14.620 --> 02:17.900
she had her Hugo under her arms.

02:17.900 --> 02:18.880
She wasn't going to let it go.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.440
And the conductor on the train looked down and he says, isn't that a Hugo?

02:27.460 --> 02:33.040
So, yeah. In other words, basically, obviously the conductor reads Science Fiction.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.000
And he recognized the award, he just did not recognize.

02:38.460 --> 02:43.260
He didn't know anything about how it was awarded or anything else, but he knows it was an enormously prestigious award.

02:43.260 --> 02:57.180
Therefore, putting Hugo award-winning author on the front of a book means that these non-fans will recognize this as something single-added exceptional, and they will buy it.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.480
Because it's the best-known award, Chalker says, it means a good deal of money to an author.

03:05.120 --> 03:11.340
It's worth quite a lot of money to someone who has not won one.

03:12.400 --> 03:19.900
I doubt it seriously whether it would mean a dime to an Azimov, or an Arthur Clark, or Robert Heinlein.

03:21.240 --> 03:27.220
These people already have their white markets, but it means an awful lot to particularly first-time winners.

03:29.620 --> 03:43.060
And it means that the publisher knows that by putting this on there, they're automatically going to have sales two or three times what they would have otherwise without even bothering to promote it.

03:43.580 --> 03:47.180
And of course, you are going to promote it. It gives you promotion money as well.

03:47.180 --> 03:56.640
Which means that I believe somebody has estimated that the minimum worth for Hugo, the minimum worth is around $50,000.

03:58.120 --> 04:04.280
Finally, we asked his opinion on the two awards. Which would a professional writer like himself prefer to receive?

04:05.180 --> 04:11.400
I think the Hugo is more desired. I think the Hugo is, as I say, commercially recognized.

04:12.400 --> 04:22.240
The Nebula, unfortunately, it sounds great. It's an award given by the science fiction writers to themselves.

04:23.140 --> 04:35.440
But because it's such a small group that does it, and because of an inordinately complex and ridiculous system of nominations and a lot of politics,

04:35.440 --> 04:44.640
and it's not just about taking Oscar-style politics and everything else, it really boils down to cliques of friends being able to nominate themselves year after year.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.740
And the Nebula is quite often won by a mere 40 votes.

04:50.740 --> 04:55.120
No matter which award a story may have won, Hugo or Nebula, it'll be a good one.

05:02.280 --> 05:11.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.240 --> 06:21.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.920
And here are your hosts.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.900
This is David Cruz.

06:32.160 --> 06:32.840
And Darrell Lane.

06:33.320 --> 06:40.440
We produce the Science Fiction Radio Show because we feel that science fiction and fantasy is the most exciting and significant literature of our time.

06:40.800 --> 06:47.080
And its popularity is more than obvious. Go into any bookstore. You'll find that the Science Fiction section is the largest one there.

06:47.080 --> 06:54.340
And a Science Fiction movie, Star Wars, is the single greatest money earner in Hollywood history, presently reaching toward a billion dollars gross.

06:55.340 --> 06:58.920
Our show is produced to keep you informed on what's happening in science fiction and fantasy.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.860
We'll interview authors, for instance, both new ones and established ones.

07:03.300 --> 07:09.900
We'll review books and movies, previewing what will be coming out, highlighting what's here now, and discussing significant work from the past.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.660
And we'll also talk with movie producers, agents, publishers, anyone involved with science fiction and fantasy.

07:15.660 --> 07:26.260
And scientists, too, will occasionally interview people from NASO, for instance, and other scientists working in areas such as robots and computers that current science fiction is dealing with.

07:32.060 --> 07:40.560
We feel that science fiction is not only an exciting literature of adventure and escape, but we're convinced that it speaks to our present society in a vital and necessary way.

07:40.560 --> 07:47.760
A new and highly popular science fiction author, C.J. Cherry, told us why she thinks science fiction and fantasy are valuable.

07:49.020 --> 07:54.000
The value of science fiction is essentially the broadening of vision.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.760
The broadening of vision in time, because we do not really concern ourselves only with the future.

08:04.080 --> 08:16.720
This is why fantasy, which deals with past ages, has been quite as comfortable in associating science fiction as it has.

08:17.940 --> 08:24.060
On the one hand, it should seem very strange to find fantasy readers and science fiction readers trading books.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.980
We think that we had nothing to say to each other.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.860
But in point of fact, we have all the world to say to each other.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.940
We have all of human experience to say to each other.

08:36.460 --> 08:47.220
We have the long view, one sort of being the memory of mankind and the other being the hope and the aspiration of where we will go and what we will do.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.020
Two sides of the same coin.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.660
Cherry also believes that science fiction and fantasy can put humanity into perspective, so to speak, can somehow show us our place in our common unity.

08:59.960 --> 09:08.040
It's a kind of literature that lightens the experience beyond one's daily life.

09:09.380 --> 09:18.280
It shows us the true size of the Earth, the true size of the universe, the true importance of our troubles.

09:20.200 --> 09:32.280
Both the size and complexity of them and sometimes the extreme simplicity of them, it gives us perspective in dealing with the world around us and with each other.

09:33.140 --> 09:42.600
And shows us that we have in many instances a good deal more in common than we do in difference.

09:50.020 --> 09:54.720
Another popular science fiction writer, Frederick Poll, spoke to us on the value of science fiction.

09:55.160 --> 10:01.080
Poll has been in the field for some 50 years, not only as a best-selling writer, but as an agent, editor and critic.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.960
He talks about one of science fiction's unique attributes.

10:05.300 --> 10:12.640
I think science fiction has special qualifications to act as a vehicle for discussing anything that affects the human being.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.480
It's a way of looking at the human race from outside objectively.

10:16.900 --> 10:26.820
It's a way of, it's a sort of game-playing mechanism for seeing what would happen to human beings under conditions that haven't occurred yet but are very possible.

10:27.620 --> 10:37.660
And I think that that's probably one of the strongest factors accounting for the continual growth and interest in science fiction that seems to have been going on as long as I've been alive.

10:38.740 --> 10:43.060
We'll continue next time with some more views on science fiction and fantasy.

10:50.600 --> 10:59.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.640
We'll be back with another episode of Science Fiction.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:58.400 --> 12:03.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.120
And here are your hosts.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.440
This is Dara Lane.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.520
And David Cruz.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.600
Why do people read science fiction?

12:18.040 --> 12:23.840
We asked that question of two of science fiction's newest and most popular authors, Jack Chalker and CJ Cherry.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.760
Jack Chalker comments first.

12:27.040 --> 12:34.420
Why people pick up science fiction and fantasy, I think, is because first and foremost because they want an escape.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.760
Because they really don't like...

12:39.480 --> 12:41.640
You know, I mean, you read...

12:41.640 --> 12:48.880
You look at the evening news, you read the papers, you know, 20 dead in El Salvador this morning.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.520
15 house fires set by Matt Arsenault's downtown.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.360
Rape is up, you know, all of this kind of thing.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.540
They're scared to get out on the street in many of the cities so on these days after dark.

13:02.820 --> 13:05.940
Seems like problems, problems, problems, unemployment lines.

13:07.160 --> 13:15.100
And then you can pick up science fiction and fantasy and you can jump into that other world.

13:15.100 --> 13:20.960
And you can become a part of it and you can be what's something else, be somewhere else.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.820
So it's the ultimate escape literature.

13:24.500 --> 13:29.560
And of course, once we've got you in the escape literature, then we sneak in the serious stuff.

13:30.980 --> 13:35.720
CJ Cherry has many of the same ideas, but she provides a little different perspective in her answer.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.640
It's curiosity.

13:39.040 --> 13:44.260
It's a wish to be in touch with one's environment, one's real environment.

13:47.140 --> 13:57.500
There are so many people who go through their daily lives concerned only with what happens in the office and what happens around them.

13:58.680 --> 14:04.900
And it's sort of like being locked in one cell, which you never see beyond that.

14:06.840 --> 14:20.520
Nature and the universe have so much more to it than what you perceive if you limit your vision to your immediate time and your immediate place and your immediate circumstance.

14:25.260 --> 14:30.080
There's a certain nobility in ordinary daily affairs.

14:30.080 --> 14:44.620
I do not deny that, but I think that the real understanding of what actually goes on in ordinary daily affairs only comes through a wider understanding of the universe as a whole.

14:44.620 --> 15:06.220
And this is what I think draws people to science fiction, to fantasy, to this whole vast realm of a romantical or positive way of looking at the universe, which has been in the mainstream of thought since literature began.

15:12.160 --> 15:20.620
Both Cherry and Chalker feel that science fiction or fantasy is almost impossible to define. It's such a broad, all-encompassing form that it just can't be pinned down.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.320
Cherry, however, offers some ideas on what science fiction is.

15:25.180 --> 15:32.880
I think the best one that ever came up was Roger's The Last Nice definition. At least I believe it's his. I don't know from whom he may have gotten it.

15:33.540 --> 15:39.580
It's basically that if I ever discover a definition of science fiction, I shall immediately attempt to violate it.

15:41.200 --> 16:05.840
Science fiction, to me, will always remain an experimental literature. It does not have rules, except to try to adhere to science and to prove things as much as possible and to try to have your research well-founded in at least the best possible understanding of what's going on that you can arrive at.

16:06.880 --> 16:20.920
To me, science fiction is the same thing that the unknown writer of the Kilgamesh epic did. It avoids in search of the unknown as a source of literature.

16:21.620 --> 16:26.420
Next time, we'll talk to some writers who go back to the pulp era of science fiction in the early part of this century.

16:33.180 --> 16:42.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:28.740 --> 17:32.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.460
And here are your hosts.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.280
This is David Carson.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.260
And Daryl Ayn.

18:05.700 --> 18:14.120
John Vengey began writing in 1974 and has already won two Hugo Awards, one for the novella Eyes of Amber and most recently for her novel The Snow Queen.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.920
The Snow Queen was Vengey's first full-length novel, and she told us that it was quite an undertaking.

18:19.880 --> 18:28.760
That book was quite an incredible thing for me to write that book because I wound up being about, it was over 600 pages of manuscript.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.400
It's almost 200,000 words long.

18:32.160 --> 18:37.580
And when I started writing it, I had never written a complete novel all at once.

18:38.120 --> 18:44.580
I'm with Outcast of Heaven Delta, I'd written the novella, and then I had increased its size to have a novel.

18:46.200 --> 18:55.160
I was feeling kind of daunted about the very idea of writing a normal, what I thought would be a normal-length novel of about 200 pages.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.140
But I finally did sit down and start to write it.

18:59.260 --> 19:05.120
The more I wrote, the more I realized that it was not going to stop at 200 pages.

19:05.280 --> 19:10.940
I think I had gotten through 100 pages and realized that I had barely gotten into the plot at all, my writing.

19:10.940 --> 19:15.760
And from then on, I could only just go on and write and write and write and see where it led me.

19:16.180 --> 19:22.940
It got more and more complicated as it went along until I really despaired at times that I would ever be able to finish the thing.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.940
As in a lot of science fiction, Vengey had to create the world on which the story unfolds.

19:38.940 --> 19:43.140
This task required her to design a believable world and the people who populated it.

19:43.440 --> 19:49.220
She told us how she developed the background material for the main city in the story and how some of the characters evolved.

20:10.980 --> 20:19.440
I wanted it to be a place where all kinds of cultures and all kinds of worlds came together and mixed and mingled.

20:20.620 --> 20:27.120
In trying to make a portrait of the city, I needed a lot of different characters with a lot of different backgrounds behind them.

20:29.380 --> 20:37.080
So I went over, I needed a new character, I went into the story and I had to figure out where it came from.

20:38.580 --> 20:42.880
I frequently don't lay everything out before I actually start to write a book.

20:42.960 --> 20:52.440
I have kind of a basic structure which I think is being sort of like a trellis and then the story is a line that grows up through it and fills it in and flushes it out and things.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.580
She told us that sometimes her characters take on a life of their own.

20:57.580 --> 21:07.960
One of the characters comes from a very advanced society, the most technologically dominant society in the book.

21:08.420 --> 21:16.760
He started out as a walk-on character, his name is Gundelino, and he came along with one of the major characters in the book in the scene.

21:16.900 --> 21:23.740
He just started acting up and out of his personality I kind of saw a whole cultural stereotype growing.

21:24.340 --> 21:32.360
I realized actually part of where he came from was that I had been reading a lot of books about, I had been reading some fiction books about Romans and Britain

21:32.360 --> 21:37.660
because I've always been fascinated by Romans and Britain as part of the archaeology thing I guess.

21:40.600 --> 21:57.920
It was a sort of science fiction reversal where the highly cultured people are the people who too often wind up in sensory fantasies, the kind of dark and fore-the people.

21:57.920 --> 22:03.800
And they're usually spulking around in the bushes, but they were the people who were slum and sophisticated and non-top

22:03.800 --> 22:09.880
and the people with red hair and sequels and green eyes were running around like howling barbarians in the brush.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.000
I thought that was a delightful twist.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.480
Next time, more about the Snow Queen with Joan Vinci.

22:22.300 --> 22:31.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:17.180 --> 23:21.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:37.220 --> 23:42.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.900
And here are your hosts.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.520
This is Dara Lane and David Carson.

23:54.180 --> 23:59.020
Last time we discussed how Joan Vinci developed the background material for her award-winning novel, The Snow Queen.

23:59.780 --> 24:03.080
She did an elaborate job of laying out the locale over which her story took place.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.660
She also had some very interesting characters for the reader to enjoy.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.240
Hans Christian Anderson wrote a fairy tale also called The Snow Queen.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.140
We asked if she used the fairy tale as a basis for her novel.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.920
Yes it is. As a matter of fact, that was my original inspiration for the book.

24:20.340 --> 24:27.300
There's a cartoon and an animated movie of the Snow Queen which they occasionally show on television.

24:28.840 --> 24:34.480
I was interested in it. I had first seen that movie when I was in about eighth grade and thought, oh this is silly.

24:35.120 --> 24:41.780
But when I saw it again back during the 70s sometime, I realized what an interesting fairy tale it is.

24:43.440 --> 24:48.840
The thing about most fairy tales is that they are frequently degenerate mythology.

24:49.280 --> 24:57.780
If you know any particular amount about Near Eastern and European mythology, you see a lot of symbolic archetypes.

24:58.500 --> 25:06.480
You see ravens and stags and the wicked stepmother and the sweet young innocence and things like that.

25:06.480 --> 25:15.000
They all actually have their archetypes back in European and Near Eastern mythology.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.180
Vingy's interest in Anderson's fairy tale goes beyond his retelling of an old myth.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.520
There were some specific concepts in his story that appealed to her.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.680
One of the criticisms of science fiction is its portrayal of women.

25:28.220 --> 25:33.280
While designing a novel around the story in Anderson's fairy tale, Vingy chose to dispel some of those criticisms.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.780
She explains how.

25:36.080 --> 25:42.620
The thing that interested me especially about this particular tale was that there was no prince in it.

25:43.340 --> 25:48.860
It's usually a prince who gets to do all the fun and exciting things like fighting the dragon and things like that.

25:49.280 --> 25:57.880
Then waking up to the sleeping maiden and the women in the story are usually either the wicked old witch or some helpless, simple and creature.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.020
I get sort of bored with that kind of thing.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.000
I was very interested.

26:03.600 --> 26:12.620
This book was quite a twist because all the main roles in it were played by women.

26:13.320 --> 26:18.080
The basic idea of the story is that there's a little girl and a little boy who are friends.

26:18.300 --> 26:23.400
The little boy is still on the way by the Snow Queen who is kind of an elemental goddess of winter.

26:23.400 --> 26:34.560
Most of the story concerns the little girl's travels as she's searching for him and all the people she meets are virtually all female.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.760
The people in positions of power in the story are women.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.440
I thought that was quite interesting and unique.

26:41.780 --> 26:48.620
I was in the mood to do a story in which women played major roles in the book.

26:48.620 --> 26:52.400
I thought that was a good jumping off point for it.

26:53.280 --> 26:58.840
Vingy's background in archaeology is probably the reason why the societies and cultures of her characters are so well developed.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.520
The background of a character usually holds the reasons and motivations for his or her behavior.

27:04.040 --> 27:14.000
Combine her background in archaeology with a semi-mythical society, starships and high technology, a lost lover and the quest to find that lost lover, and you've got Joan Vingy's The Snow Queen.

27:14.540 --> 27:17.200
She commented on what she was attempting when she wrote the story.

27:18.240 --> 27:24.540
I didn't want to write a fantasy though. I didn't want to just make it a retelling of the fairy tale.

27:24.780 --> 27:29.020
I really wanted it to be a whole new story and I wanted it to be science fiction as well.

27:30.140 --> 27:35.080
That's just the way my brain works. I have written a couple of fantasy stories recently.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.580
I've always enjoyed reading fantasy as well as science fiction.

27:39.520 --> 27:45.580
So far the majority of my work has been at least technically science fiction.

27:46.380 --> 27:49.380
In The Snow Queen Joan Vingy has displayed her depth as a writer.

27:49.880 --> 27:57.420
She developed a complex society but retained an interesting storyline and her story follows the main characters all over the galaxy without losing track of any of them.

27:58.040 --> 28:02.340
Even though The Snow Queen is somewhat longer than most books, it easily holds the reader's attention.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.220
Vingy has done a fine job with her novel and it is well deserving of its high praise and awards.

28:14.420 --> 28:23.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
