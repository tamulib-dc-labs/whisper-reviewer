00:11.120 --> 00:18.160
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.160 --> 00:20.400
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.900
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:30.620 --> 00:34.280
The subject of this show is social science fiction and satire.

00:35.180 --> 00:39.440
Almost any science fiction book concerning the future will suggest a future society. A

00:39.440 --> 00:43.480
novel on space exploration will imply technology and social motivation behind the exploration.

00:44.140 --> 00:49.220
Robot stories usually describe society's reaction to humanoid machines. But there are a rather large

00:49.220 --> 00:54.000
class of novels and stories that deal primarily with societies of the future. Narratives in which

00:54.000 --> 00:58.680
the focus is on the structure of future societies, the societal attitudes, religion,

00:59.100 --> 01:04.520
mores, personal lifestyles, and the politics of an extrapolated future. Sometimes these books

01:04.520 --> 01:08.480
are critical in their speculations about where mankind and his social institutions are heading.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.680
Sometimes they are outright depressing and pessimistic. At other times they treat the

01:12.680 --> 01:18.600
subject with humor or satire, either of a gentle or biting nature. It is in this area especially

01:18.600 --> 01:22.680
that one can perceive the unique values of science fiction, since novels of the future

01:22.680 --> 01:26.820
allow for serious speculation on both the immediate and far-reaching destiny of man.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.220
Some of the greatest science fiction novels of all time belong to that category of social

01:31.220 --> 01:37.160
science fiction. In that type of imaginative fiction, with a strong social comment, has an

01:37.160 --> 01:41.740
awfully long tradition behind it. I think you can take it back at least to Plato's Republic,

01:42.180 --> 01:47.440
back in classical days. Then Sir Thomas Moore in the Renaissance, of course, had his famous

01:47.440 --> 01:54.040
utopia, which dealt with the future society. Francis Bacon wrote The New Atlantis in the

01:54.040 --> 02:01.220
early 17th century. At the end of the 19th, Samuel Butler published Erwan and Ralph Bellamy

02:01.220 --> 02:06.700
published Looking Backward, both in regard to future societies. But the master, H. G. Wells,

02:07.400 --> 02:14.240
many of his books dealt with societies of the future. The Time Machine of 1895 described

02:15.560 --> 02:21.000
a future society very pessimistically. When the sleeper wakes, almost at the turn of the

02:21.000 --> 02:26.700
century, he did the same thing. Wells also, in his War of the Worlds, described what it

02:26.700 --> 02:32.000
might be like if England, or Great Britain, the great colonizer of their time, was invaded

02:32.000 --> 02:36.880
by a technology vastly superior to theirs. As England was invaded in Africa at that time,

02:37.240 --> 02:43.880
that could be considered sort of a satire. I think probably his deepest treatment of

02:43.880 --> 02:49.020
a future society that would be men like God's published in 1922. That's a little later than

02:49.020 --> 02:54.220
most of his other books. In it, he dealt with overpopulation, the misuse of science. He

02:54.220 --> 03:01.500
described a world teetering almost chaotically on ruin. And his solution to it was birth control

03:01.500 --> 03:13.860
and the elimination of the unfit in order to get society to get it moving again. But

03:13.860 --> 03:17.640
the time machine of the future society, which described future societies and set the tone

03:17.640 --> 03:21.820
for almost all of the other treatments of them, would be Huxley's Brave New World in

03:21.820 --> 03:25.980
1932 and Orwell's 1984, published about halfway through the century.

03:26.820 --> 03:33.780
These two novels show us two different styles or approaches to the social commentary. In

03:33.780 --> 03:40.700
Huxley's Brave New World, we see a dystopia caused by technology, the genetic engineering

03:40.700 --> 03:46.780
that is involved. As opposed to Orwell, where here we have a system that is politically

03:46.780 --> 03:53.160
repressed. It is not necessarily the technology that's caused this. It's a political thing.

03:54.580 --> 03:59.520
Yes. In Huxley's Brave New World, he used a sort of class society which divided people

03:59.520 --> 04:05.580
up into various levels. The Alphas were the elite of the system. They were the makers

04:05.580 --> 04:09.200
of the government. And then it went on down through betas and gammas and epsilons and

04:09.200 --> 04:15.840
deltas. And each one had various functions that they carried out. The Alphas and betas

04:15.840 --> 04:20.980
and gammas and so on were brought about through genetic engineering. They were individually

04:22.100 --> 04:26.500
engineered so that they would have special abilities, some having higher levels of thought

04:26.500 --> 04:32.080
and some having greater levels of manual dexterity. Others set up for heavy labor and lifting

04:32.080 --> 04:32.880
and stuff like that.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.720
Of course, that class system, that regimentation you mentioned comes about because of the science,

04:37.720 --> 04:42.000
the technology which the people have no choice. In other words, they're engineered to be what

04:42.000 --> 04:46.840
particular class they're in. But in Orwell, that kind of regimentation is due to politics

04:47.580 --> 04:54.480
rather than science or technology. Orwell was caught between two authoritarian dictators,

04:54.720 --> 04:58.100
I guess you'd say. Hitler was right behind him when he was writing his book in Stalin.

04:58.260 --> 05:01.880
He was right in front of him. So it was almost natural that he would deal with politics in

05:01.880 --> 05:03.920
his dystopian society.

05:04.860 --> 05:09.340
Several of the catchwords from the book have remained faithful throughout the years, although

05:09.340 --> 05:14.480
the original reasons behind them, that being them slanted towards Stalin and his secret police,

05:15.040 --> 05:23.440
people still use the term big brother when they talk about the IRS, some of the government

05:23.440 --> 05:24.780
agencies like the CIA.

05:26.600 --> 05:31.800
Any political entity that seems to repress the people is referred to as big brother,

05:31.800 --> 05:34.980
whether it's become a phrase unto itself even away from the book.

05:36.360 --> 05:42.720
Of course, many of the things that Orwell showed the government using, communication, spy devices

05:42.720 --> 05:50.020
and so forth, we still have them today. He was extrapolating from the knowledge and the science

05:50.020 --> 05:52.400
of his day. And of course, those extrapolations have come true.

05:53.180 --> 05:57.680
Another thing he used in the novel was a term called Newspeak, which was really a new language

05:58.260 --> 06:04.160
where specific terms and references to what the government didn't like, such as anti-government

06:04.160 --> 06:08.940
activities, were deleted from the language. There were no words to define those particular types

06:08.940 --> 06:15.960
of anti-government idioms. One of the party's prime sayings was who controls the past controls

06:15.960 --> 06:21.900
the present and who controls the present controls the future. And the society was strictly controlled.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.480
Everybody was watched all the time. And that means all the time when you're at home and

06:27.480 --> 06:31.940
in your house or you're outside, you're always being monitored by some sort of sophisticated

06:32.540 --> 06:37.640
telecommunications devices. I believe we'd have to say too that that's one of the more pessimistic

06:38.980 --> 06:45.380
futurian or dystopian novels and that the ending is not really upbeat or not very hopeful.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.220
The protagonist in the novel thinks he's broken away at least somewhat from this society,

06:50.260 --> 06:54.240
but he is found out and brought into the ministry of love, which is really the police,

06:54.800 --> 07:00.480
and they interrogate him and eventually put him through some severe behavioral modification

07:01.200 --> 07:08.720
techniques. And he is brought about to once more being a integral part of society,

07:09.080 --> 07:12.680
thinking Big Brother is good for him, think the party is watching out for him,

07:13.220 --> 07:20.740
and once more becomes a complacent cog in the wheel. The point is perhaps an examination of

07:20.740 --> 07:26.080
whether or not society can be controlled to the point where people will forget that they're human

07:26.080 --> 07:31.220
and will forget their drives of going on progressing and whether they can be

07:32.540 --> 07:36.740
satiated with all of their needs met by the society itself.

07:39.360 --> 07:44.520
I think we might also divide our discussion into two areas here. Now, all of these novels,

07:44.520 --> 07:51.460
of course, deal with the future, but some of them are more aimed at simply commenting on

07:51.460 --> 07:55.760
future societies, whether they think they're going to be good ones or not, whereas others

07:55.760 --> 08:02.360
are actively satiric in which they make fun or criticize certain aspects of today's society.

08:03.520 --> 08:07.340
But I think one of the better known novels, which is I think mostly one of social comment,

08:07.940 --> 08:13.720
pessimistic though it is, is Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, which when you look at the date of publication

08:13.720 --> 08:20.560
1953 is surprisingly enough only four years later than Orwell's 1984. But I think it does stem from

08:20.560 --> 08:27.720
Huxley, Fahrenheit 451 does in that it's the technology which is dominant. Our electronic

08:28.700 --> 08:34.460
media-oriented society has done away with books and the people are subject to electronics.

08:36.240 --> 08:41.740
They are rather complacent populace. They sit around and watch television all the time, and the

08:41.740 --> 08:48.900
television is huge. It covers the entire wall. In fact, it can cover three walls in a person's house.

08:49.060 --> 08:54.560
If they provide for the society or for the state to their best ability, they may actually get a

08:54.560 --> 09:00.660
fourth screen and have a room that completely surrounds them with television. Bradbury does

09:00.660 --> 09:04.580
have, I think, some ingenious things in the novel. For instance, the fireman, one of the,

09:04.580 --> 09:09.140
well, the main character is a fireman. Their job is to start fires rather than put them out.

09:09.140 --> 09:14.240
And the fires they start, of course, are book-burning fires. Anybody who's caught with a book is guilty

09:14.240 --> 09:20.620
of a social sin. And it's near the end of the book that the protagonist who's escaped his fireman's

09:20.620 --> 09:26.320
job and is trying to get away from the hound, the electrical hound, was chasing him. He runs

09:26.320 --> 09:32.920
across from misfits, some bums or some hobos down by the river. And each one of them is a book.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.420
He has totally memorized one of the classics from the past and knows it word by word, line by line.

09:39.160 --> 09:43.320
So that even though they no longer own books or have have access to them,

09:43.320 --> 09:47.420
they still remember the great ideas from the past simply because they've memorized them and

09:47.420 --> 09:50.920
try to keep themselves intact and safe so that they can retain this knowledge.

09:51.960 --> 09:59.500
In essence, his novel starts out as a dystopia, but ends up having a sort of glimmer of hope at

09:59.500 --> 10:04.900
the end of it. At least that these ideas from the past, these great works will not perish,

10:04.900 --> 10:08.880
but will be kept alive, handed down to the agents by word of mouth.

10:10.160 --> 10:16.660
This last aspect of the book was treated very well, I think, in the 1966 film of this book

10:17.300 --> 10:24.580
made by Francois Turfot. The scene of the book Learners at the End is one of the more

10:24.580 --> 10:32.500
marvelous things in that film. The mood is just right with each person spouting off part of the

10:32.500 --> 10:39.140
books that he knows, memorizing it and remembering it, and the old man teaching his knowledge to

10:39.140 --> 10:43.320
the young man so that that will be passed on from generation to generation.

10:44.320 --> 10:49.800
You know, it's remarkable how many movies of science fiction nature have this type of social

10:49.800 --> 10:56.400
comment as a purpose. It's almost as if Hollywood has taken as its special province the kind of

10:56.400 --> 11:00.980
science fiction novel or story which would describe a future society, and there have been many of them,

11:00.980 --> 11:04.900
you know, going all the way back into the early days of movie making as far back as

11:05.980 --> 11:11.780
oh the 20s or 30s, things to come. In that particular film and the story it was adapted from,

11:11.880 --> 11:17.180
which was called Shape of Things to Come, Wells speculates on what the future might be after

11:17.180 --> 11:22.480
an upcoming war which he visualizes in that. The future is fairly bleak, at least in Great

11:22.480 --> 11:28.180
Britain, until the airmen come over from the Mediterranean and help them set up a new civilization,

11:28.780 --> 11:34.140
and through technology they eventually rebuild the earth. It's a fairly optimistic.

11:35.120 --> 11:40.160
We also might mention the movie THX 1138 by George Lucas.

11:40.680 --> 11:47.500
This was prior to the time when Lucas wrote and produced American Graffiti and then followed

11:47.500 --> 11:54.640
it by Star Wars. This particular movie was about a dystopian future where everybody lived underground

11:54.640 --> 12:00.720
in an extremely regimented society where sex was forbidden. People were kept in control by use

12:00.720 --> 12:05.480
of drugs whenever they began to feel good or feel bad. They simply went to the medicine cabinet in

12:05.480 --> 12:09.240
the bathroom, opened it up and told the medicine cabinet how they felt, and it would dispense drugs

12:09.240 --> 12:14.760
to take care of how they felt. It would make them feel back in a complacent, compliant mood that

12:14.760 --> 12:21.100
was condoned by the government. Soilent Green came out in 1973. That was from a novel by Harry

12:21.100 --> 12:26.680
Harrison entitled Make Room, Make Room, and it's one of the classic overpopulation novels.

12:27.620 --> 12:33.200
In this case it's food that they're running out of, and the population is fed by sort of

12:33.200 --> 12:39.140
biscuits or crackers of different colors, and the protagonist, played by Charlton Heston in the movie,

12:41.960 --> 12:48.480
investigates and by the end of the movie finds out the horrible fact that the crackers or the

12:48.480 --> 12:55.660
biscuits that people are now eating, called Soilent Green, are made from disposed of bodies, human

12:55.660 --> 13:03.220
bodies, and the movie ends on that rather grisly note. We better mention just a few other significant

13:03.220 --> 13:09.760
novels of social comment before we get onto satire. John Brunner, a 1976 public shockwave writer,

13:10.500 --> 13:16.040
and I think that should be mentioned. Brunner's been called a master of sociological extrapolation.

13:17.200 --> 13:23.660
He's a writer on society, that's his thing. In that book he pictures a 21st century America,

13:24.120 --> 13:29.260
which is totally based on computers and data processing. This is a technology that is shaped

13:29.260 --> 13:34.860
society, and you have a plug-in society which is developed. The computer is everywhere. People

13:34.860 --> 13:38.300
plug into it, get their directions, tell the government what they're doing, and so forth.

13:39.420 --> 13:45.520
And the hero named Nick learns how to alter the computer's data banks, which reveals a government

13:45.520 --> 13:51.000
manipulation of people and so forth. At the end of the book you get the impression that maybe

13:51.000 --> 13:56.320
something is going to be done about it. This kind of repressive computer society might be overthrown.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.100
Similar concept was brought forth in Hour 11's This Perfect Day written in 1970.

14:05.140 --> 14:10.340
And as usual, as you might expect, Larry Niven and Jerry Pornel get into the act. They cover almost

14:10.340 --> 14:15.120
every category of science fiction you could think of. Their 1976 novel Inferno, I think,

14:15.120 --> 14:21.440
would have to be considered an important novel, a social comment. What they did was rewrite Dante's

14:21.440 --> 14:27.920
Inferno in science fiction terms and explore different facets of human psychology.

14:29.600 --> 14:35.740
I'd like to mention also one other novel that would fit in this category. A very optimistic

14:35.740 --> 14:42.100
novel called Inferio by Jack Vance. It's set on another planet, but it is a human society. This is

14:42.100 --> 14:45.920
far in the future when humans have expanded into space on many planets.

14:46.940 --> 14:52.780
We have a society here that is repressed by a system of lords and ladies who live away from

14:52.780 --> 15:00.940
the common people. And the people are known for their handcrafted work. And they are kept doing

15:00.940 --> 15:06.360
this handcrafted work. They're repressed in the way that they cannot produce anything that's

15:06.360 --> 15:11.220
duplicated, not even printing. One of our people on the planet, the protagonist,

15:11.520 --> 15:17.460
breaks away from this society because he feels like that their life is really meaningless. It's

15:17.460 --> 15:22.860
just the same old thing every day in and out. He breaks away from the society and then eventually

15:22.860 --> 15:30.620
shows them the error of it and changes the society for better. Another way that an author might comment

15:30.620 --> 15:36.100
on society or some of the problems that he sees in society is by using satire,

15:36.320 --> 15:43.680
where he can poke fun with humor at what's happening in society, or he can bitterly criticize

15:43.680 --> 15:50.720
what's going on in society. I think the classic here would be the Space Merchants. It was originally

15:50.720 --> 15:55.680
published as a novelette called The Gravy Planet. And I think it was 1952 edition of Galaxy.

15:56.340 --> 16:02.660
Cyril Kornbluth and Frederick Polakorst collaborated on it. But probably in terms of pure satire

16:03.280 --> 16:09.780
and also pure extrapolation from the present, this novel I think would be above most others.

16:10.180 --> 16:19.940
It's a totally advertising society. Consider how much time, effort, influence that advertising has

16:19.940 --> 16:24.920
in our society today. Some people think, you know, the hidden persuader, for instance, by

16:24.920 --> 16:29.480
Vance Packard was a study that illustrated the importance of advertising. Now what Kornbluth

16:29.480 --> 16:34.560
and Polakorst have done is to set up a society where the total society from the government on

16:34.560 --> 16:40.780
down is based on advertising. The heroes of the society are so-called copy smiths, people who

16:40.780 --> 16:48.220
are master advertisers, masters at molding the minds of the people. One of the phrases in

16:48.220 --> 16:55.800
advertising, cutthroat competition is brought into a grim reality here in that if one of your

16:55.800 --> 17:00.280
competitors in advertising comes up with an idea that you want, you can literally declare a war on

17:00.280 --> 17:05.800
him and physically go out and attack his corporation and win from him that specific contract.

17:07.200 --> 17:12.400
The world in which this particular novel takes place is overpopulated and the resources have

17:12.400 --> 17:19.540
been drained. The protagonist is the head of a project which will take a lot of the populace

17:19.540 --> 17:26.420
off to Venus to mine for specific minerals and metals to refurbish the resources on earth.

17:27.100 --> 17:31.200
What they have to do is convince the populace that it's a good thing to go to Venus because it's a

17:31.200 --> 17:35.160
wonderful place. Whereas in actuality, they know that Venus is a horrible place and they're going

17:35.160 --> 17:41.100
to have to live in domed underground cities and whatnot. That turns out to be the solution to

17:41.100 --> 17:47.380
the novel because the basic conflict is between the leaders of this advertising society and a

17:47.380 --> 17:52.760
group of conservationists called the conces. The conces feel that man has to get off the earth.

17:53.180 --> 17:59.580
His whole value system has to change and he has to get off the earth to do that. They help and use

17:59.580 --> 18:05.800
the protagonist at the same time to the one involved with the Venus project. They help him

18:06.400 --> 18:09.880
so that this campaign is successful and their people, the conservationists,

18:10.240 --> 18:15.640
are the ones who go to Venus. I think we're supposed to believe they will start a new vital

18:15.640 --> 18:22.380
society on that planet. One of the things that helps the protagonist make it up his mind about

18:23.940 --> 18:34.920
the Venus project and what he's going to do with it is he's kidnapped in Antarctica. His death is

18:34.920 --> 18:40.560
Costa Rica as a lowly consumer and he gets to see life as a consumer whereas before he's been a

18:41.160 --> 18:47.520
high executive and he's had special privileges that went along with that rank. Once he sees society

18:47.520 --> 18:52.340
from the other side, he believes there are certain things that he wants to do about it in order to

18:52.340 --> 18:59.480
change society. The style of the novel I think should be called a prospective reader's attention

18:59.480 --> 19:06.820
too. It's very cleverly done. There are many puns. There are many restatements of present

19:08.320 --> 19:13.120
little sayings or advertising cliches and so forth which are extrapolated and changed a

19:13.120 --> 19:17.820
little bit for this novel. It causes a great deal of humor. I think that kind of humor and that kind

19:17.820 --> 19:23.820
of biting criticism that the authors put into the book definitely qualified as a work of satire.

19:23.820 --> 19:29.180
Not just simple social comment but they are satirizing our present day society and the

19:29.180 --> 19:35.220
importance we give to business and advertising. Another novel which satirizes advertising is

19:35.220 --> 19:41.240
The Big Bottle Wax by Shepard Mead written in 1954. It does to television what space merchants

19:41.240 --> 19:47.200
does to advertising in general. It extrapolates on what television might become at least from the

19:47.200 --> 19:55.820
viewpoint of a person who is living in the 50s. It shows how it dominates his life through advertising

19:55.820 --> 20:01.600
and courses him into buying products which he might generally if he had time to think about

20:01.600 --> 20:11.080
he wouldn't buy. It dehumanizes the news by using dolls to reenact various natural disasters and

20:11.080 --> 20:15.840
crimes whereby people don't actually see human suffering. All they see are these little dolls

20:15.840 --> 20:23.080
reenacting the specific tragedies. Both of those books I think concentrate on

20:23.080 --> 20:27.460
specific facets of our present day society for instance advertising or television.

20:28.600 --> 20:34.260
But there's another writer Stanislaw Lam who satire is really aimed at almost the whole human

20:34.260 --> 20:37.840
race. He'll pick almost everything possible and satirize it sooner or later in some of his works.

20:39.580 --> 20:46.380
This satire is of the very very humorous variety. It's just a joy to read and there's all sorts

20:46.380 --> 20:54.140
of different escapades that he gets his stories into and out of. One novel we might mention in

20:54.140 --> 20:59.880
particular is The Siberiad. The concept of the novel is that far in the future humankind has

20:59.880 --> 21:04.960
degenerated and the robots that they built ages and ages ago have become a civilization

21:04.960 --> 21:11.340
unto themselves. There are two main characters both of course are robots, trurl and clopalceus.

21:12.260 --> 21:17.960
They are constructors. Their design is to build things. There are all sorts of different kinds

21:17.960 --> 21:23.240
of robots but their main purpose is to build other things, other machines. They get into

21:23.240 --> 21:28.720
all sorts of escapades and usually they're a little bit vying with each other to come up with

21:28.720 --> 21:34.580
something a little bit better than the other one did. One episode that might illustrate the idea of

21:34.580 --> 21:42.640
satirizing society is a very short one called trurl's prescription and he postulates out in

21:42.640 --> 21:48.400
remote space a small planet of a small creatures called the steely pips and they live in a very

21:48.400 --> 21:56.260
mechanized society, very happy society until a great comet comes by one day and deposits something

21:56.260 --> 22:03.300
they don't know what it is onto their planet. This something whatever it is according to the book

22:03.300 --> 22:07.900
flies up lands on the highest peak and makes itself comfortable and doesn't budge but it's

22:07.900 --> 22:14.440
an awful nuisance all the same. Well the steely pips call in trurl one of the one of the constructors

22:14.440 --> 22:19.540
to see if he can get rid of it for them because they've tried everything and they want to know if

22:19.540 --> 22:25.400
they they can bring them some tnt or dynamite or or radiation or whatever that he needs and trurl

22:25.400 --> 22:31.480
says no you just need paper ink stamps and seals sealing wax and thumb tacks and blotters and a

22:31.480 --> 22:38.040
teller window and zink teaspoon and coffee and a mailman and he proceeds to set up an office

22:38.680 --> 22:45.700
and starts sending the creature whatever it is summonses and notices and you will have to

22:45.700 --> 22:50.660
vacate by certain time if you don't sign these particular forms and so forth. Finally the

22:50.660 --> 23:00.160
creature which has condescended to reply to the notices is ordered to vacate and has to do so

23:00.160 --> 23:05.340
because he's playing along with the system that trurl set up. At the very end of the story

23:06.680 --> 23:12.020
trurl explains how this worked to the steely pips who are quite confounded they don't understand.

23:12.740 --> 23:16.580
He says basically my dears the whole thing was quite simple the moment it accepted the first

23:16.580 --> 23:22.440
dispatched and signed for it it was done for. I employed a special machine the machine with a big

23:22.440 --> 23:29.760
B for as the cosmos is this cosmos no one's looked at yet. B of course stands for bureaucracy.

23:32.180 --> 23:37.880
Yeah the the stories in the Siberiad as you say they belong to a almost like a novel with

23:37.880 --> 23:41.880
these two characters doing their thing but they're almost set up like separate little fables and in

23:41.880 --> 23:49.120
some of them his satire is aimed at much larger things in society. He gets his two characters

23:49.120 --> 23:54.860
involved in another adventure near the end of the Siberiad and they discover a civilization which

23:54.860 --> 24:00.380
has reached the highest possible level of development. They call it an HPLD civilization

24:01.080 --> 24:07.000
and they want to learn from these people why what's it like to be in the highest possibly

24:07.000 --> 24:12.020
developed state and these creatures don't want to respond they're simply stagnant

24:13.000 --> 24:19.720
but finally they do respond because of certain machinations and certain overtures that the two

24:19.720 --> 24:26.880
robots make and they give the two robots a compound called altruizine and they say altruizine if you

24:26.880 --> 24:32.700
put it in the water supply of any plant any city whatever will make everyone feel the same way as

24:32.700 --> 24:37.300
everybody else does and this should bring about universal brotherhood in other words you can feel

24:37.300 --> 24:41.880
exactly what your neighbor your friend your relative whatever is feeling and this should

24:42.480 --> 24:47.120
you know cause all violence to stop because if you feel something like they do you'll understand

24:47.120 --> 24:54.840
them better but I think uh stand-as-law limb can be somewhat cynical sometimes and I think this is

24:54.840 --> 24:58.680
one instance of it the two robots do put this substance into the water supply of a planet

24:59.240 --> 25:04.780
and it causes immediate chaos everybody feels the pain of everybody else and they suffer and they

25:04.780 --> 25:08.680
try to do away with the other people so that they their suffering will stop and the whole place

25:08.680 --> 25:15.360
is just turned upside down because of humanitarian motives of these two robots one of the more

25:15.360 --> 25:20.700
interesting satirists of our time is Kurt Vonnegut there's an interesting story behind Vonnegut's work

25:20.700 --> 25:27.000
he's always tried to avoid the label of being a science fiction writer uh he realized that

25:27.000 --> 25:32.700
science fiction authors are not as highly considered by critics and teachers and scholars and so forth

25:32.700 --> 25:39.800
as mainstream writers so he's always tried to avoid that label but I would say 75 of his work would

25:39.800 --> 25:44.280
have to be classified as science fiction uh he's written about time travel for instance in slaughter

25:44.280 --> 25:50.860
house five he's written about robots and space travel in the sirens of titan a player piano

25:50.860 --> 25:57.900
was considered a classic dystopia of an automated world uh cat's cradle is a cataclysmic novel which

25:57.900 --> 26:03.560
with definite science fiction overtones in it and back in the 50s and early 60s he published

26:04.140 --> 26:09.700
stories in science fiction magazines like galaxy fantasy and science fiction if wonder stories and

26:09.700 --> 26:16.400
so forth and he's one of the rare writers I think who's noticed by critics and readers beyond the

26:16.400 --> 26:23.060
circle of science fiction people and one of his classic satiric stories uh would be one published

26:23.060 --> 26:29.780
in 1961 in galaxy entitled harrison bergeron in harrison bergeron you see a society where it is

26:29.780 --> 26:37.140
mandatory that you be equal to everybody else if you are an athlete you're required to wear

26:37.140 --> 26:43.000
weights in order to slow you down so you can't move faster than anybody else if you are exceptionally

26:43.000 --> 26:48.380
beautiful you're required to wear a mask so you won't appear prettier than anybody else in fact the

26:48.380 --> 26:52.200
government is in charge of enforcing these rules there's there's even a united states

26:52.200 --> 26:57.880
handicapper general who who makes uh all of the judgments as to whom should wear what kind of a

26:57.880 --> 27:06.040
mask and to what degree and same thing for belts and and other devices there are also uh devices

27:06.040 --> 27:14.420
that uh fit in the ear that are loudspeakers that will inject very weird sounds or sound effects

27:14.420 --> 27:21.380
or crashes or noises to distract an agile mind from being able to think straight meaning that

27:21.380 --> 27:25.040
they would be smarter or quicker or medley than someone else that they even enforce that kind

27:25.040 --> 27:32.680
of mental mediocrity and harrison bergeron is is almost the antithesis of what the society believes

27:32.680 --> 27:38.040
in he's he's huge he's seven feet tall he's beautiful you know has the body of a greek god

27:38.040 --> 27:45.820
he's also a genius and he manages to escape all the traps and all the restrictions that the society

27:45.820 --> 27:52.000
has imposed on people and escapes and meets a beautiful ballerina who's been dancing of course

27:52.000 --> 27:57.540
with lead weights on her body and they immediately fall in love this perfect pair all beautiful all

27:57.540 --> 28:02.620
intelligent uh and so forth and they start to rise dancing and their beautiful dance of love

28:03.180 --> 28:08.680
and um also they're on television at the time that this is going on and everybody is watching

28:09.260 --> 28:16.160
this beautiful happening and uh one of the people comes in from the handicappers the government

28:16.160 --> 28:20.980
handicappers and shoots them with a shotgun and kills them both and they both fall to the floor

28:20.980 --> 28:27.240
dead and then uh the scene shifts back to uh harrison bergeron's parents who are watching this

28:27.240 --> 28:31.840
program and uh his father re-enters the room he's going out to get a sandwich while this beautiful

28:31.840 --> 28:38.500
stuff was going on and uh when he comes back in uh he his wife has a few tears on her face and he

28:38.500 --> 28:41.860
says well what happened he says well something beautiful happened on the television but i can't

28:41.860 --> 28:46.000
really remember what it was and he says well that's the way it ought to be and then things just keep

28:46.000 --> 28:51.920
going on in conclusion we might say that it's clear that novels of social comment are among the more

28:51.920 --> 28:57.300
thoughtful of science fiction books usually the author is seriously concerned with mankind's future

28:57.300 --> 29:01.800
and it's not merely creating a pure adventure story to excite the readers like in star wars

29:02.520 --> 29:06.800
it is in this category of satire and social comment that science fiction has contributed

29:06.800 --> 29:19.920
most significantly to mainstream fiction this is david cruz darrell lane and david carson

29:21.020 --> 29:26.480
this has been the science fiction radio show a presentation of the permean basin science fiction

29:26.480 --> 29:32.700
association in conjunction with kocv fm and odessa college odessa texas
