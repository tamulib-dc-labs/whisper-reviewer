00:01.280 --> 00:02.080
You're on.

00:02.380 --> 00:03.220
Yeah, okay, we're running.

00:03.900 --> 00:07.140
Let me try that question from another direction.

00:07.780 --> 00:08.500
The last question.

00:09.580 --> 00:17.380
In terms of your opinion, which book or books are you most satisfied with and secondly,

00:18.140 --> 00:22.100
which of your alien cultures are you perhaps most satisfied with?

00:23.360 --> 00:25.420
That is a very difficult question.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.480
It's like asking a parent to choose among twins and triplets, you know.

00:34.220 --> 00:39.260
There are several books which are dear to my own heart for various reasons.

00:40.100 --> 00:47.860
The more game books I think because they were conceived among the earliest and they contain many things which are, I guess,

00:47.860 --> 00:56.020
most young writers grow up with a sort of a fantasy world of their own and that one does contain some elements of that.

00:57.660 --> 01:23.260
The Fated Sun books because I felt very deeply in numbers of things that I was saying in the down below station in many ways because it cost me so much work in terms of assembling an entire universe

01:23.260 --> 01:25.740
that I am going to use in subsequent books.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.580
I had the feeling that I had just created the world after putting that together.

01:35.060 --> 01:49.000
And certain aliens from particular cultures are, I even got fond of old Soothed in The Fated Sun and only a mother could love that one.

01:50.700 --> 01:58.120
So I do develop a bit of an infection for the number of my alien creations and even some of the unlovable ones, I guess,

01:58.260 --> 02:02.480
just because I know no one else is going to be able to stand them. Soothed, of course, is the villain.

02:04.380 --> 02:09.000
And I cast it in that way and that's not his fault except for being what it is.

02:11.940 --> 02:30.920
But it's very difficult to pick and choose because I guess I always try to do the things that, like the Hunter of Worlds, I like, I think partly because it's a kind of book that I wanted to write and I got away with it.

02:30.920 --> 02:40.720
Don Walheim was very, very understanding in that department because I think many editors would have come and said,

02:40.860 --> 02:47.420
well, yes, but no one will understand those words. You've got to change them to English and that would have defeated the entire purpose of the book.

02:49.500 --> 03:00.360
And that one is sort of one of the very, very strange books that I can reread and find something I didn't know it was there, which is kind of an odd feeling.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.580
Okay, I realize that would be a tough question to answer. I just thought I'd try it anyhow.

03:10.620 --> 03:20.740
You did mention a little while ago that you're working on a number of things. Could you just briefly comment on some of the things you're working on that might be near completion? They're not giving away plots or anything.

03:20.740 --> 03:37.230
Well, my current project is an extension of a short story called The Dream Stone and a novel called Eldwood.

03:38.810 --> 03:49.150
There's set in a sort of an alternate area of England just north of Wales and opposite Ireland. There are fantasy stories.

03:51.230 --> 04:00.250
I wanted to do something with Celtic mythology even before I had read Tolkien.

04:00.250 --> 04:11.090
Tolkien came out with, of course, The Lord of the Rings, which I discovered when I was in university. Before, incidentally, it became as popular as it did.

04:12.410 --> 04:22.450
And I thought, oh dear, someone has done it so well. This is a problem. And it was years before I could tackle anything similar.

04:23.330 --> 04:37.570
So I decided, all right, the only way to get rid of the ghost, as it were, is to go all the way back to mythic sources and to write from the myth rather than from a literary influence.

04:37.570 --> 04:55.730
So that's what I've been attempting to do. Although one must not expect another Lord of the Rings, I was just doing my version of Elves, which has always fascinated me as characters.

04:58.090 --> 05:08.190
But that's been a current project and one which I've had a great deal of joy in, sort of allowing me to stretch unaccustomed muscles.

05:08.890 --> 05:14.530
I've been out of the mythic realm for quite a while, and this was a chance to do it again.

05:16.450 --> 05:21.930
I have several that I'm working on.

05:23.510 --> 05:29.770
Let's see, what people might be interested in ones that I definitely know are forthcoming.

05:31.770 --> 05:43.650
There's one called Merchant's Luck, which should be out this spring, which is a story set in the same area of space as Down Below Station.

05:45.190 --> 05:55.450
It can be read apart from it, completely separate from it, but I think that a reader would enjoy it more if they happened to have read Down Below Station first.

05:56.830 --> 06:08.290
It involves a very, very simple story. It's very alike the story I set out to write and then discovered that you can't do that kind of story without laying your groundwork.

06:08.610 --> 06:20.830
So I built the universe in which this takes place and then wrote the story finally after all this time, which is a very simple space adventure story that I had to build a universe in which it could happen.

06:23.190 --> 06:37.930
Then there's another one, which is quite strange. It's sort of a combination of space technology and Tennyson's idols of the king, which I suppose has to be seen to be believed.

06:39.210 --> 06:47.430
And we're still talking about what the title of that one is going to be, so I can't give a title except to say that it will be out this next year.

06:48.730 --> 07:00.030
I'm working on a number of alien contact things, and I've got a couple of books, which are very strange, that I don't know if I will ever get finished or not, but they're fun to muddle around with.

07:03.090 --> 07:13.390
Okay, David wanted me to ask you this. I guess I would have asked you too. How can you put out so many books? It's incredible.

07:13.390 --> 07:16.250
I've heard a number of books you've come out with in the last couple of years.

07:16.730 --> 07:28.030
Well, I work at it full time, and I enjoy doing it. I mean, physically, they say that it doesn't take very long to write a book.

07:28.950 --> 07:39.530
Like I said, if you do it all from scratch, you could sit down at the typewriter and rip one off and inside a month, maybe two weeks to type a novel if you really want to kill yourself at the keyboard.

07:40.250 --> 07:49.430
The problem is thinking it up. My tendency to shift radically between types of novels, I think, has contributed a great deal to my output.

07:50.370 --> 08:02.390
If I wrote, and as some writers do, all in the same universe, I would have a very great difficulty maintaining the kind of output that I do.

08:02.990 --> 08:10.670
I would get to where I thought I would be thinking, did I say that in this book or was it the last book?

08:13.650 --> 08:22.430
There's also a shifting of types, and there's a fact that I use a computer when I write. That helps a great deal.

08:24.030 --> 08:30.890
I write with a word processor. I have not always, but I started doing that this year.

08:32.150 --> 08:38.350
And before that, I wrote with a sort of a semi-word processor, which again, speeded things up a great deal.

08:42.330 --> 08:49.170
And actually, I believe that the last of my works to be composed on an ordinary typewriter was The Fated Sun.

08:50.270 --> 08:57.050
And if you ask how did I maintain my output up to that point, the answer is that I'd rather kill myself.

08:58.930 --> 09:07.330
I literally would leave the keyboard with my back hurting so badly that it hurt to straighten up.

09:08.130 --> 09:13.470
My fingers aching where I would soak them in hot water trying to get the peaks out of them.

09:13.930 --> 09:20.810
Nowadays, I find writing a good deal more a lot relaxing.

09:20.990 --> 09:27.310
I just have the computer print out my latest stuff, and I lie down on the couch,

09:27.450 --> 09:30.290
prop my feet up and sit there and go over the rough with a pencil,

09:30.630 --> 09:34.770
and sip coffee with one hand and make leisurely corrections with the other.

09:35.430 --> 09:36.570
So it's a good deal, easier.

09:38.330 --> 09:42.430
Okay, we've been amazed at how many science fiction writers are using word processors these days.

09:42.550 --> 09:43.690
I guess that does save time.

09:44.670 --> 09:48.450
Do you have any possible movie racks coming up, or anything that might be made into movies?

09:50.910 --> 09:55.710
Yes, I'm not sure really how much I ought to talk about that particular item,

09:55.850 --> 10:04.990
because some of the things are under negotiation, and it might not be thoroughly helpful,

10:04.990 --> 10:10.410
but suffice it to say that there has been some movie interest in some things,

10:12.950 --> 10:20.570
also games, and this sort of thing.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.350
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.850
Okay, that's really all I guess.

10:29.310 --> 10:30.570
We've taken enough of your time.
