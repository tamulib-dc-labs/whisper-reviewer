00:01.540 --> 00:03.680
I'll ask, I liked God's hooks.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.620
Oh, thanks.

00:05.660 --> 00:07.580
It's a nebula, I find myself, I don't know.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.760
How does it stack up?

00:08.960 --> 00:12.500
You said you wanted each story, each succeeding story to be better.

00:12.660 --> 00:13.600
Is it better, do you think?

00:15.100 --> 00:20.760
I think I'm more satisfied with it than I am with a lot of stories.

00:22.380 --> 00:26.600
It's about exactly like I wanted it when I started it.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.280
It's got two interesting historical characters in it to give.

00:31.340 --> 00:37.920
Yeah, what amazed me is when I started doing the story is that nobody had thought of it

00:37.920 --> 00:38.360
before.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.180
I mean, because Walton and Bunyan were exact contemporaries, although Bunyan was 30 years

00:44.180 --> 00:44.520
younger.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.440
I mean, they died within four years of each other.

00:47.660 --> 00:52.100
You know, Walton was born in 1593 and died in 1683.

00:52.780 --> 00:57.340
And Bunyan was born in the 20s sometime and died in 88.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.700
You know, and it's amazing that nobody had stuck those together.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.140
And because they did, anytime you look at a survey of English literature, the two books

01:07.820 --> 01:13.520
that are unclassifiable, the only two unclassifiable books in other words are like biographies

01:13.520 --> 01:17.740
and there were like histories and there were beginnings of novels and there were poetry

01:17.740 --> 01:19.040
and plays and all that.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.160
But the only two unclassifiable books they talk about are Pilgrim's Progress and the

01:24.160 --> 01:24.900
Complete Angler.

01:25.220 --> 01:30.820
You know, those are two totally, totally, you know, classical books and they're not

01:30.820 --> 01:34.880
like any other books written that century or before or since, you know.

01:36.400 --> 01:44.600
And it's like they're just, you know, it amazed me that nobody, nobody had put the two together.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.140
And the obvious way to put the two together was, you know, I'm gonna sit in there one

01:49.140 --> 01:52.520
day and I said, I was doing research on Walton and Bunyan and all this.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.400
I said, Walton fish is in the slew of the spawn.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.760
You know, it's obvious, you know, right?

01:58.140 --> 02:00.700
You know, it's just, it's just totally obvious, you know.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.760
And it amazed me that nobody had done it before, especially a British writer, you know, especially

02:05.760 --> 02:06.560
a British writer.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.600
There were lots of people who were capable of doing that, you know, and nobody had done

02:12.600 --> 02:12.780
it.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.060
And it was amazing.

02:14.820 --> 02:15.380
Great.

02:15.720 --> 02:15.940
Okay.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.680
I guess that ought to do it.

02:18.780 --> 02:19.200
Oh, great.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.600
Thank you.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.360
Oh, very much.

02:23.100 --> 02:23.400
Sure.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.160
Appreciate it.

02:24.260 --> 02:24.560
Uh-huh.
