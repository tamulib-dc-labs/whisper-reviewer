Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.940
And here are your hosts.

00:43.760 --> 00:44.960
This is David Crews.

00:45.260 --> 00:45.920
And Daryl Lane.

00:46.660 --> 00:50.720
If there's such a thing as a science fiction connoisseur, he would have to be a Jack Vance

00:50.720 --> 00:51.080
fan.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.940
Vance is a distinctive author who's been writing science fiction and fantasy since the 1940s.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.980
And even in a field like science fiction, Vance's imagination is remarkable.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.860
His depiction of alien worlds, for instance, impresses any reader.

01:04.540 --> 01:08.920
He has a powerful, subtle style and with the colors and textures of his descriptions, and

01:08.920 --> 01:12.540
his careful attention to the resources of language, he can make you believe you're on

01:12.540 --> 01:15.180
another planet, somehow involved in an alien culture.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.160
We might mention the Durdane trilogy or the four novels of the Tschai or Planet of Adventure

01:20.160 --> 01:25.100
series as examples of Vance's skill at creating alien environments and cultures.

01:25.860 --> 01:29.760
Vance always wanted to be a writer and he chose science fiction for the simplest of reasons.

01:55.220 --> 02:04.160
I've kind of, even when I was 12 years old, I told myself I kind of liked to be a writer.

02:05.780 --> 02:10.500
Why I chose science fiction, I don't know, or fantasy, whatever you want to call it.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.360
When I was a kid, I'd done a lot of reading.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.520
I've done a lot of reading in everything, far as I could.

02:18.520 --> 02:42.340
But I've probably more touched my, or not influenced, I guess you might say, by the fantasy and the so-called science fiction, rather than by much anything else.

02:43.120 --> 02:51.200
As we've said, Vance started back in the 1940s in the pulp magazines, and his early work lacks the polish and distinctive flair that he's known for.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.400
I was learning my trade.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.460
I just got started writing, not as real young, you know, like some guys did.

03:01.260 --> 03:06.880
In fact, I was doing lots of those things, and then I decided I was going to be a writer and I started writing.

03:08.220 --> 03:19.680
I had all the talents for it, I guess, apparently, but I didn't have the knack or the practice, or whatever you want to call it, of putting the words together.

03:20.780 --> 03:27.120
And also, I was trying to write the wrong kind of story.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.800
Those days, the gadget story was very big.

03:32.680 --> 03:47.560
And I'd waste a lot of time trying to write gadget stories on scientific breakthroughs and things like that, which is essentially kind of a line-downing, I think.

03:49.220 --> 03:56.760
And it's a phase of the field which has mercifully gone over the hill.

03:57.580 --> 04:02.040
I've got a very good scientific background, and if not I don't know science, I do know it.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.620
I was going to be a physicist, actually, for a while.

04:08.620 --> 04:18.660
In the 40s and 50s, I was writing in these barometer collecting rejection slips.

04:19.680 --> 04:32.900
That was an apprentice period in which I was paid not very much for it, but, you know, checked once in a while.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.160
But, essentially, those 40 and 50 stories, they're not much good, they're not worth it.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.900
I just soon forget them.

04:45.260 --> 04:50.640
Vance's apprenticeship must have been well spent. The science fiction and fantasy he's been writing ever since is masterful.

04:51.160 --> 04:59.700
In 1963, he won the Hugo Award for the Dragon Masters, and in 1966, he won both the Nebula and Hugo Awards for The Last Castle.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.880
Tomorrow, more with Jack Vance.

05:09.620 --> 05:15.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:15.420 --> 05:18.360
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:19.240 --> 06:24.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.000
And here are your hosts.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.140
This is Daryl Lane.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.200
And David Crews.

06:36.880 --> 06:41.140
Jack Vance has created a unique, vivid and fascinating body of science fiction and fantasy.

06:41.780 --> 06:46.880
He began his career in the pulp magazines of the 1940s, and he wrote the gadget stories that were popular then.

06:47.400 --> 06:52.140
But over the years, he's developed a deeper, more subtle and distinctive type of science fiction and fantasy.

06:52.740 --> 06:57.360
Yet the curious fact is that not many people, even science fiction readers, have heard of Jack Vance.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.460
We asked him why he thought that was so.

07:28.720 --> 07:39.460
On the one hand, I think he because not many people have ever read.

07:40.940 --> 07:52.120
And wouldn't, I'm not sure, say been accused of having an affair with people and whether

07:52.120 --> 07:56.140
I've underseen so it seems to me if I were looking at my own career in this way,

07:56.840 --> 08:10.540
kind of quietly from northeast somewhere, rather than through having a movie or something or so.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.860
Lately, Vance has been writing three, four, and even five novel series set on alien planets.

08:16.860 --> 08:21.820
He's noted for his imaginative descriptions of alien settings and cultures more than anything else.

08:22.420 --> 08:28.700
The four books in the Tschai series, or the Durdane trilogy, are good examples of stories set in convincingly alien environments.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.160
Vance has also recognized for the stories in the Dying Earth series.

08:32.840 --> 08:41.420
And don't forget, Vance has written excellent mystery fiction, even winning the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1960 for his book The Man in the Cage.

08:42.240 --> 08:49.060
Even though some readers talk of a unique Vance style, Vance himself says he has no particular style or writing characteristics.

09:11.640 --> 09:19.460
Everything anybody writes, the style or the way the words are put together is part of the mood of the story.

09:19.740 --> 09:25.200
It is part of the story itself. It's part of the completed product.

09:26.340 --> 09:31.040
Now, when you say, why did I, how did I evolve this?

09:31.040 --> 09:53.660
That implies that I have one style that I use for everything from this early Dying Earth thing up to one of those mystery stories with localum in the countryside out here called Fox Valley Murders.

09:54.120 --> 09:58.800
If you take the trouble to examine the way the words are put together, you'll find it totally different.

09:59.220 --> 10:11.180
Also like in Bad Ronald, which is a spence story, the way the words go together or different from the way the words go together and say, oh, I don't know what.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.280
No, I don't have any style.

10:21.120 --> 10:28.920
Vance considers himself a storyteller or entertainer with no access to grind. He's reluctant to provide explanations or analyses of his work.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.880
When asked about a particular character or episode in one of his works, Vance has a characteristic reply.

10:36.380 --> 10:38.860
Well, I think everybody will have to answer that for themselves.

10:39.680 --> 10:46.400
Reading the science fiction of Jack Vance makes answering questions like that worthwhile. More with Jack Vance tomorrow.

10:53.640 --> 11:02.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.880
And here are your hosts.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.820
This is David Crews.

12:20.160 --> 12:20.840
And Daryl Lane.

12:21.540 --> 12:26.520
The dying Earth stories of Jack Vance, one of the most exquisite creations in the realm of science fantasy.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.920
The setting for the stories is a bit unusual.

12:29.560 --> 12:34.240
It's Earth, but an Earth so many millions of centuries into the future that it's almost dead.

12:34.720 --> 12:40.540
And so is the sun, sputtering like a candle ready to go out and bathing Earth in its final pale red light.

12:40.540 --> 12:47.460
There are only a few people left on Earth, and most of these are sorcerers, since magic works and science has been forgotten.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.780
Vance says that the dying Earth stories are some of the earliest things he ever wrote.

12:52.880 --> 12:58.980
Well, the funny thing about it is that was written before I started selling.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.440
That was written at sea, as well as merchant seals.

13:03.640 --> 13:14.920
And I didn't have quite a bit of spare time to begin writing these flamboyant, highly colored stories.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.640
But those were written, oh, very, very early.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.480
They were written before I started selling.

13:23.480 --> 13:34.080
So they're just representative of a rather early stage.

13:35.300 --> 13:41.100
And then when I started writing the so-called gadget fiction or other stuff,

13:42.060 --> 13:46.660
I changed the style of the dying Earth stuff.

13:46.660 --> 13:52.200
It wasn't at all suitable for writing the stuff I began selling.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.380
Some of the stuff I was selling was in the beginning, but it wasn't.

13:56.840 --> 14:10.240
But at least the style of the dying Earth would have been absolutely, what's the word, incongruous when the fittings find different styles.

14:22.060 --> 14:29.080
Many readers believe the style of the stories, which Vance calls flamboyant and highly colored, to be the most marvelous and vivid thing about them.

14:29.560 --> 14:34.480
It creates an exotic yet wistful atmosphere, somehow appropriate for a world on the edge of extinction.

14:35.160 --> 14:41.000
Tim Underwood is a friend of Vance's, and along with Chuck Miller, publishes Vance's work in specially made collector's editions.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.920
The Underwood Miller publishing company's first book was the Dying Earth.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.680
We asked Tim Underwood why.

14:47.680 --> 14:56.400
A lot of science fiction and fantasy, and sometimes the best of it, does not get published in hardcover editions.

14:57.280 --> 15:05.700
And the Dying Earth was the first book we did, and it was just a book that is essentially a classic.

15:06.540 --> 15:13.080
It was published in 1950 as a paperback, and it had never been in hardcover.

15:14.620 --> 15:20.660
And it's just one of the outstanding books in the fantasy field, and 200 years from now people will be reading it.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.120
And it had never been in a durable hardcover edition, so we put it in one.

15:32.700 --> 15:38.640
Vance didn't write any new Dying Earth material for 15 years after the book's original publication in 1950.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.140
We asked him if it was perhaps reader responses, which caused him to take it up again.

15:44.640 --> 15:48.920
No, it's been, I don't know, I just always wanted you some more stuff in there.

15:51.420 --> 15:57.480
In this encounter, it was, uh, swarming around in my head.

16:14.760 --> 16:21.640
The character swarming around in his head was Kugel, the Picker-esque rogue who survived on the Dying Earth through his wits and his nimble fingers.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.200
The Kugel stories were collected in 1966 in a book entitled The Eyes of the Overworld.

16:28.040 --> 16:33.780
Since then, Vance has written other Kugel stories, and says he'll do more in the future, so the Dying Earth isn't dead yet.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.920
More on Jack Vance tomorrow.

16:43.440 --> 16:52.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.480
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:52.160 --> 17:57.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.820
And here are your hosts.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.420
This is Daryl Lane.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.500
And David Crews.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.940
Jack Vance is one of the major talents that the field of fantasy and science fiction has produced.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.580
Tim Underwood, his friend and publisher, offers some reasons why.

18:17.440 --> 18:23.100
I think Jack has accomplished some things with some of his works that have just never been done before.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.640
Not only in terms of style, but in terms of feeling.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.380
He hearkens to a certain spirit, I think.

18:36.080 --> 18:45.580
A certain kind of person or certain kind of spirit is on his wavelength and responds strongly to his work.

18:47.960 --> 18:53.900
The latter part of his work and the best of his work is extremely well crafted.

18:54.120 --> 19:00.680
He's a craftsman, very well written, and accomplishes a lot of really unusual things in a very quiet way.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.960
Vance's accomplishments have been impressive.

19:04.580 --> 19:08.020
His science fiction career spans almost 40 years and began back in the pulp era.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.300
He's won the major awards for his science fiction and fantasy writer.

19:11.300 --> 19:17.100
One is the Hugo Award, awarded by readers, and the other is the Nebula Award, given by other writers.

19:17.860 --> 19:23.940
Some of his best known work includes The Dying Earth Stories, which go all the way back to his beginnings as a writer in the 40s,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.740
and more recently the five demon princes novels.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.500
Still, Vance hasn't received much recognition.

19:30.020 --> 19:31.120
We asked Underwood why.

19:32.360 --> 19:45.760
My feeling is that one responds strongly to Vance, one who feels much the same way about the world that he does.

19:46.120 --> 19:55.740
I think, why isn't he though as popular as, say, John Lai Corre, who I think people respond to in the same way?

19:55.740 --> 20:07.420
Well, Vance is more of a rarefied taste, I think, is the kind of things that he feels are important.

20:07.940 --> 20:16.980
The strangeness in the world about us and the unusual qualities of life itself, those kind of considerations are not important to a lot of people.

20:18.380 --> 20:24.420
People who do feel these things strongly are going to like Vance's rights.

20:24.820 --> 20:28.800
They're going to enjoy reading. They're going to enjoy the world that he's created.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.160
He's not done a lot of the things that make other writers successful.

20:33.820 --> 20:35.860
Like, he's never stayed with one character.

20:36.760 --> 20:50.900
The way that, say, Lai Corre stayed with Smiley, or the way that someone writes a Doc Savage novel 15 times in a row, or whatever.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.080
He hasn't done that.

20:53.740 --> 21:00.840
And he hasn't had one hero that he's repeated for any great number of books.

21:00.840 --> 21:14.140
And he hasn't had one contemporary theme that appeals to people like the battle of the sexes or something like that.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.520
Those aren't Jack's themes.

21:16.080 --> 21:24.000
Jack's considerations and themes are enormously subtle and kind of a rarefied nature.

21:24.320 --> 21:29.920
Vance has always been reluctant to discuss his own work or to offer any insights into his themes or intentions.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.800
Underwood suggests a reason.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.220
The rise of the overworld is the sequenced stories of the fellow Cougal.

22:05.400 --> 22:12.020
And that's partly because Cougal's a rascal, and Vance himself is a bit of a rascal.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.720
And Cougal's even more so.

22:15.900 --> 22:22.420
He's the kind of rascal that Vance would like to be if he wasn't such a nice guy at heart.

22:29.920 --> 22:38.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:18.700 --> 23:22.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:38.420 --> 23:43.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.180
And here are your hosts.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.780
This is David Crews.

23:54.080 --> 23:54.700
And Daryl Lank.

23:54.700 --> 24:03.740
In 1975, a science fiction and fantasy publishing company was formed because two men wanted to get one particular science fantasy book between hard covers.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.880
Tim Underwood, one of the men, explains.

24:07.820 --> 24:13.760
In 1975, I decided I wanted to publish a book.

24:14.620 --> 24:18.020
Specifically, I wanted to publish The Dying Earth in a hard cover form.

24:19.260 --> 24:29.760
And I was a used book dealer, and Chuck Miller was a used book dealer dealing in rare and out of print books and some new material.

24:29.760 --> 24:35.820
And we knew of each other, and I think we had bought and sold books from each other from time to time.

24:38.100 --> 24:54.160
And Chuck heard about, I may have mentioned in a letter about The Dying Earth, and Chuck offered his expertise because he knew a good deal about certain parts of publishing industry, about distribution and that end of it.

24:54.720 --> 25:02.280
And my experience, my limited experience, had to do with just graphically putting a book together.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.460
And so he suggested that we do the book together.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.000
And so we did.

25:08.780 --> 25:15.440
And the interesting thing is that we never met each other until the book had already been published.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.900
And that was a year later in 1976.

25:20.100 --> 25:31.400
And up to that time, we were literally exchanging thousands of dollars through the mail and doing business without ever having met each other.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.420
We were in a sense complete strangers.

25:34.220 --> 25:49.220
But we had this one connection, and that is we both felt strongly about this one work of Fance's The Dying Earth and about Fance's work in general and specifically about fantasy and science fiction and horror and literature.

25:50.200 --> 25:56.300
Since that first book, The Underwood Miller Company has published some 50 books, all science fiction, fantasy and horror.

25:56.300 --> 26:02.380
Their print runs for each volume average of 1,000 copies, hardly enough to compete with the large New York publishers.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.100
Underwood explains why.

26:28.940 --> 26:39.260
We couldn't, we would make more money if we printed more books, because as you print more books, the cost per book of manufacturing goes down dramatically.

26:42.540 --> 26:48.200
But we just simply can't afford to have a lot of books in inventory sitting around.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.180
We can't afford, our books got a print in about nine months.

26:52.100 --> 26:58.480
And this is just the opposite of a major manufacturer, like Dutton or Brown or someone like that.

26:59.840 --> 27:03.200
They want their book to stay in print as long as possible.

27:03.660 --> 27:06.800
And we want our books to go out of print as soon as possible.

27:14.560 --> 27:19.920
Tim Underwood and Chuck Miller have a sincere interest in significant works of science fiction and fantasy.

27:20.620 --> 27:28.100
That is just a pleasure of book making. Just a pleasure. Chuck and I both take a great pleasure in making a good book.

27:28.760 --> 27:37.120
A book that has its signature sound, which is something that doesn't occur in general trade, hardcover publishing anymore.

27:37.900 --> 27:44.080
A book that's printed on acid-free paper so that in 20 or 30 years the paper won't turn brittle and brown.

27:45.180 --> 27:51.860
And just a well-made, well-bound book, attractively made and artistically put together.

27:52.280 --> 27:56.980
And do a publishing a book like that, creating a book like that is really a pleasure.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.560
Underwood and Miller are publishing books by many authors in beautifully illustrated editions now.

28:03.200 --> 28:09.000
Anyone who likes fantasy and science fiction, and anyone who likes books, should search out some of their work and hold on to it.

28:16.140 --> 28:21.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:21.900 --> 28:24.840

28:47.160 --> 28:48.560
Thank you.
