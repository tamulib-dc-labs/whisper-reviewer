WEBVTT

00:01.140 --> 00:05.480
Dr. Williams, first of all, we'd like to begin with what you're working on right now.

00:05.880 --> 00:09.100
I'm working on a novel called The Queen of the Legion.

00:09.340 --> 00:14.840
There's another story about the Legion of Space, a series that I started back in the

00:14.840 --> 00:15.900
early 30s.

00:18.340 --> 00:20.080
Is it going to be serialized like the other?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.420
Well, here's hoping the market's sort of uncertain.

00:22.940 --> 00:28.240
Fred Pole gave me a contract for it a couple of years ago, and I was president of the Science

00:28.240 --> 00:34.400
Fiction Writers of America and involved in other things, and it has taken time to do,

00:34.540 --> 00:38.760
but it's finally falling together, and I'm putting it into my new word processor.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.420
I'm pretty enthusiastic about it now.

00:42.680 --> 00:48.660
The main character is a girl, and at first I was sort of uncertain whether I could be

00:48.660 --> 00:53.440
convincing in presenting a woman's point of view, but I've sort of fallen in love with

00:53.440 --> 00:54.340
Jill by now.

00:54.340 --> 00:57.540
I think I know her pretty well and like her, and I hope the readers do.

00:59.240 --> 01:04.220
Have you finished that trilogy with Fred Rick Pole, the one on the Dyson Sphere, the three

01:04.220 --> 01:04.860
volumes on that?

01:04.940 --> 01:07.200
No, I'm sorry to say we haven't.

01:07.680 --> 01:16.660
I finished my part of the second volume some years ago, I think, and a year and a half

01:16.660 --> 01:23.860
ago Judy Lynn Dallaray gave us a revised contract with a larger advance, and her idea

01:23.860 --> 01:31.200
then was to publish all three proposed volumes in one thick volume, and Fred was going to

01:31.820 --> 01:37.420
get it out last March at that time, but that's the last I've heard about it.

01:38.760 --> 01:45.420
He's promoting his work, he's involved in many projects, and that's always been the

01:46.260 --> 01:47.540
history of working with him.

01:47.540 --> 01:52.840
He's a great collaborator, but he takes his time, so I have hope that he'll eventually

01:52.840 --> 01:53.720
get back to it.

01:54.260 --> 01:59.000
Have you, recently you've been redoing some of the humanoid material too, correct?

01:59.180 --> 02:01.240
Have you finished, is there a novel that's come out of that?

02:01.240 --> 02:07.400
Yeah, there's a new novel called The Humanoid Touch that I finished all over a year ago,

02:07.540 --> 02:12.400
and it will be published, I think, this summer in a limited signed edition from Fantasia

02:12.400 --> 02:16.900
Press with a whole round heart, heart cover this November.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.500
Part of that was serialized and analyzed.

02:19.500 --> 02:25.680
The analog reprinted or printed the middle of it under the title Humanoid Universe.

02:26.940 --> 02:31.360
There was a reference in that story or somewhere to a book called Ten Trillion Wise Machines.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.460
Well, that was my second title.

02:34.660 --> 02:39.460
At first I was going to call the novel The Humanoid Universe, and Fred didn't like that,

02:39.720 --> 02:46.960
and I wanted to call it Ten Trillion Wise Machines, which is a title I like, but people

02:47.520 --> 02:53.940
wanted the name Humanoid in the title, and also that's pretty long to go on a book jacket.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.760
And J.K. Klein, a science fiction photographer, is the man who came up with the title The

02:59.760 --> 03:05.680
Humanoid Touch, which I think is appropriate and brief and has humanoid in it, and I'm

03:05.680 --> 03:06.520
very happy with it.

03:07.580 --> 03:11.620
Perhaps you could explain the difference between humanoid and androids and robots.

03:11.620 --> 03:23.960
Well, in my mind, the robots are a mechanical man, and the hymnids are a type of robot,

03:24.160 --> 03:29.660
that is, they're made out of plastic and steel and operated by remote control, by computers,

03:29.920 --> 03:30.720
and so forth.

03:31.520 --> 03:36.940
And androids, as I use the term in the commentaries many years ago, and I think it's generally

03:36.940 --> 03:44.460
used as a, let's say a meat machine, a synthetic or artificial human being made out of flesh

03:44.460 --> 03:51.000
and blood, the sort of thing that is possible to produce these days, or in the near future,

03:51.120 --> 03:57.920
by genetic engineering, let's say, that is, androids bleed in humanoid's drip grease.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.920
It's interesting that you're going back and doing some of the material you started, well,

04:06.920 --> 04:09.080
the legion material, the humanoid's and so forth.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.380
Was it 1928, you began publishing?

04:12.540 --> 04:19.640
The first story was published in the November, December 1928, that's the year of amazing,

04:20.480 --> 04:22.540
and I've been a science fiction writer ever since.

04:22.720 --> 04:27.620
That was in the tradition of merit, wasn't it more of a fantasy kind of?

04:28.120 --> 04:31.420
Pretty much, at that time I was infatuated with merit.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.580
I haven't re-read him for many years, lest the spell be gone, but the first stories I

04:38.580 --> 04:45.820
wrote, well, were full of these attempts that had purple color illustrated with too many

04:45.820 --> 04:53.040
adjectives, and later I began to try for more convincing settings and stronger characters

04:53.460 --> 04:54.700
and fewer adjectives.

04:55.340 --> 04:56.720
What made you start writing?

04:57.460 --> 05:03.020
Well, I grew up on a sand hill farm in the south part of this county, when times were

05:03.700 --> 05:13.080
pretty grim, and I, well, wanted to be some sort of scientist without any direction or

05:13.080 --> 05:19.040
means to get a scientific education, and a few months after Grinchbach started the

05:19.040 --> 05:25.560
Old Amazing, when I came across some copies of it, and I was immediately fascinated with

05:26.440 --> 05:34.100
experiments that worked with traveling time and spaceships to other worlds and all sorts

05:34.100 --> 05:39.360
of wonderful things, and it's been an important share of my life ever since.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.220
Did you start for the money?

05:43.040 --> 05:50.420
No, the money was, well, almost immaterial. I got twenty-five dollars for that first story

05:50.420 --> 05:58.700
eventually, and after a couple of years I earned enough writing science fiction, so I

05:58.700 --> 06:04.680
didn't have to do anything else, but half the secret was that I wasn't married and

06:04.680 --> 06:12.720
was willing to live economically, so I certainly didn't do it for the money. After two years

06:12.720 --> 06:20.060
in college I was offered a student assistantship in the chemistry lab, and I could have had

06:20.060 --> 06:25.260
a different career as a chemist, probably only I was more fascinated with science fiction

06:25.260 --> 06:31.520
than I was with solid science by that time, though I have tried to keep up as best a layman

06:31.520 --> 06:33.440
can with what's going on in science.

06:34.420 --> 06:39.040
Was the account true that I read in one place where you didn't know that your story had

06:39.040 --> 06:40.520
been accepted until you saw the magazine?

06:40.680 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, that's true. I wrote these stories on an old Remington Basket Model typewriter

06:47.000 --> 06:52.060
and a purple ribbon, and two or three of them came back, one of them was with a misspelled

06:52.060 --> 06:57.620
word in the title, and the metal man never did come back, and I was over at Canyon, Texas

06:57.620 --> 07:04.860
walking by a newsstand one day, and I saw my metal man on the cover of Amazing, and

07:05.700 --> 07:07.580
it was quite a thrill.

07:09.060 --> 07:16.620
What was it like to write for the pulp, say, through the thirties and so forth? Was it

07:16.620 --> 07:20.400
a part of something, or did you feel isolated out here?

07:20.660 --> 07:23.200
Well, there were many around here who could share your interest.

07:23.520 --> 07:31.300
Well, the science fiction world has always been a sort of special community where I suppose

07:31.300 --> 07:36.680
we felt we had our own special hand on science in the future and the shape of things to come,

07:36.780 --> 07:44.080
and though I didn't see other science fiction people very often, I read their stories and

07:44.080 --> 07:53.920
read letters in the magazines and so forth. In those days, before the paperbacks and before

07:53.920 --> 07:59.740
TV and before the comics, my people read a lot more for entertainment than they do nowadays,

08:00.440 --> 08:06.140
and there were really three sorts of magazines. There were quality magazines like Harper's

08:06.140 --> 08:13.080
and the old Scribner's, Atlantic for people with brains and the slicks printed on coated

08:13.830 --> 08:18.900
paper that would take good advertising for people with money to spend and the pulps for

08:18.900 --> 08:26.140
people who had neither brains nor money, but we had a lot of fun in the pulps even if we

08:26.140 --> 08:35.040
were looked down upon widely and eventually by a science fiction gut recognized as being

08:35.040 --> 08:39.880
not entirely without brains, let's say, and nowadays there's a little bit of money in

08:39.880 --> 08:41.060
it sometimes.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.980
The fact that it wasn't call science fiction, was it?

08:44.440 --> 08:50.660
No, when I started, my first story was printed as science fiction, Hugo Gernsback ran the

08:50.660 --> 08:58.900
word science and fiction together. He invented the term science fiction in 29, I think, and

08:58.900 --> 09:03.160
at that time you had to explain what it was. I used to say it was adventure stories with

09:03.160 --> 09:04.220
a science background.

09:04.920 --> 09:10.000
Well, wasn't Gernsback, didn't he want more scientifically oriented stories?

09:10.000 --> 09:18.740
Well, he preached a gospel that science fiction was sugar coated science, that it was education

09:18.740 --> 09:27.560
and he got a whole panel of experts with degrees that were supposed to vet the science and

09:27.560 --> 09:34.320
science wonder stories when he started that, but actually I think that was as much for

09:35.110 --> 09:44.440
him to impress the readers as anything else because he did use true science in his stories

09:44.440 --> 09:51.140
when he could get it, but he also printed a lot of stories that were pretty wild. I think

09:51.140 --> 09:55.500
always in the magazine the adventure element was more important than the science.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.980
I've only seen a few copies of those very early pulps. They say the amazing stories.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.820
That's a pretty big size.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.100
The size that time is nowadays.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.220
Were there other sizes too or types?

10:07.460 --> 10:16.160
Well, amazing was that size and wonder stories when Gernsback started that, but they were also,

10:16.520 --> 10:26.360
and they were hardly regular pulps because in the beginning they were amazing was filled up with

10:26.360 --> 10:31.780
reprints of classic science fiction and the rates were so low that professional writers

10:31.780 --> 10:35.820
didn't write for them so when they wrote new stories they were mostly written by amateurs

10:35.820 --> 10:45.960
such as myself, but the pulp magazines were published in chains with, well, sometimes

10:45.960 --> 10:51.560
quite a different magazines. There were mass economies there because they could print the

10:51.560 --> 10:59.520
covers all in the same press run and so forth and they had a standard smaller size.

11:01.820 --> 11:07.100
Astounding came along from Clayton first as astounding stories of super science.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.300
It was the pulp size.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.800
What was the average rate for stories nowadays?

11:13.080 --> 11:20.920
Well, Gernsback paid a half a cent or a word or less, which meant well, you'd get $25 for a short story

11:20.920 --> 11:29.720
and $75 for a novelette, but Clayton paid two cents a word and up, which is one reason maybe

11:29.720 --> 11:37.980
the Clayton magazines were bankrupt in the Great Depression, but that meant that I could

11:39.140 --> 11:47.800
pound out 4,000 words a day for two days and earn 160 bucks, which was a fabulous feat for a farm kid

11:47.800 --> 11:49.040
in depression days.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.240
That was a pretty good income back then.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.860
It was. It was a lot of money.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.740
Did you get much reader response? Did fans or readers ever?

11:56.740 --> 12:05.200
Well, of course, I didn't know many people in the locality who read science fiction, but in those days

12:05.200 --> 12:11.440
the backs of the magazine were filled up with letters and tiny type from readers, and that was the

12:11.440 --> 12:17.500
principal reader response. I think the editors favored them because they didn't have to pay for the

12:17.500 --> 12:26.600
letters, and they were interesting to us. I used to write them myself as well as read them.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.280
It was the beginning of fandom, I suppose.

12:33.540 --> 12:39.300
From when I can gather, reading back on your publishing history and so forth, through the

12:39.300 --> 12:45.120
30s, late 20s or early 30s, you were mostly writing, I guess I would call it space opera, the

12:45.120 --> 12:46.380
legion material.

12:46.660 --> 12:51.540
I've never objected to space opera. I still think it's wonderful, and I even think that

12:51.540 --> 12:56.940
Star Wars could have been made out of my legion stories as well as it was from something else.

12:57.040 --> 13:05.120
I enjoyed Star Wars tremendously as a sort of adolescent daydream, and well, the pulp readers

13:05.120 --> 13:14.860
were mostly young and as naive as I was, and the space opera was a sort of symbolic escape

13:14.860 --> 13:17.260
from all sorts of things.

13:19.760 --> 13:26.260
I notice, I'm not sure how I would phrase this, a change or a deepening or a more serious

13:26.260 --> 13:30.800
aspect to your fiction that begins in the late 30s. Would I be right in saying that?

13:30.800 --> 13:37.560
Well, probably. I was growing up and the readers were growing up. That's something that's been

13:37.560 --> 13:43.620
going on in science fiction, at least in American science fiction all along. I think you can draw

13:43.620 --> 13:49.760
a distinction between, let's say, European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand,

13:49.760 --> 13:57.620
which has always been recognized and treated as literature and the pulp American science

13:57.620 --> 14:04.620
fiction, which was looked down on. But as the readers of that grew older, some of them

14:04.620 --> 14:09.880
started writing, some of them started editing magazines, most of them outgrew science fiction,

14:10.040 --> 14:18.440
but some of them didn't. So there was a continual increase in the education, the sophistication

14:18.440 --> 14:24.780
and so forth of the whole field, or maybe you should call it a diversification, because

14:24.780 --> 14:30.300
there's still a readership for Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard and whatever.

14:31.480 --> 14:38.320
There are also people who, let's say, former fans who are now academic fans who are teaching

14:38.320 --> 14:46.700
science fiction courses and writing scholarly articles on science fiction to meet the publisher

14:46.700 --> 14:55.120
parish test and so forth. So essentially the field is just diversified into all sorts of

14:56.200 --> 14:58.620
levels and areas of interest.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.860
Did Campbell influence the way you wrote fiction at all?

15:02.320 --> 15:10.240
Well, yes. I think he influenced the way nearly everybody wrote science fiction, because when he

15:10.240 --> 15:17.460
became editor of Amazing and later changed the, I mean astounding, later changed the name

15:17.460 --> 15:26.260
to Analog by, he had the best highest paying market in the field. He was, well let's say,

15:26.340 --> 15:33.440
science fiction was serious to him as a way of speculating about science and its impact

15:33.440 --> 15:40.440
in the future of mankind and so forth. He was tremendously inventive. He was full of ideas

15:40.440 --> 15:48.820
that he shared very freely and everybody who was writing science fiction for those years

15:49.370 --> 15:55.280
was influenced by Campbell, it seems to me, whether directly or not. If they weren't trying to write

15:55.280 --> 16:03.260
for him and reading his letters, they were reading such writers as Heinlein and DeKamp

16:03.260 --> 16:11.280
and Sturgeon and a dozen others who were Kamal writers. And some people resetted Kamal and felt

16:11.280 --> 16:20.020
that it was an effort to write for him. Kamal, Heinlein used to complain that you couldn't sell

16:20.020 --> 16:27.560
him adult sex, but Kamal and I thought so much alike so that I always felt at home with

16:27.560 --> 16:36.700
this magazine and enjoyed working with him and he gave me occasional very useful suggestions

16:36.700 --> 16:45.000
that I used and he never did, well, edit my material heavily or try to persuade me to say

16:45.000 --> 16:50.840
anything I didn't want to say. I believe that personally he was optimistic about science

16:50.840 --> 16:57.820
in the future, but when I wrote such a pessimistic dystopian thing as with folded hands, he published

16:57.820 --> 17:00.900
it as it was and asked for more.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.240
I was going to ask you about that with folded hands. You sold that one to Campbell, you sold

17:05.240 --> 17:05.580
it to him?

17:05.920 --> 17:12.720
Right, and he suggested a sequel to it. He was fanatic for various things that look sort

17:12.720 --> 17:19.320
of like a crackpot nowadays, including Joseph Ryan and parapsychology and he suggested if

17:19.320 --> 17:24.380
people's hands were folded they would use their minds, they would develop parapsychological

17:25.420 --> 17:31.160
powers and perhaps defeat the humanoids. I felt that the humanoids couldn't be defeated

17:31.160 --> 17:39.500
so that the ending of my novel was sort of ambiguous, but he published it as I said it

17:39.500 --> 17:42.080
to him and the readers seemed to like it well enough.

17:42.660 --> 17:47.060
I was interested in what you wrote in the afterword to one of the recent additions of the

17:47.060 --> 17:51.780
humanoids, the way your interpretation of it has changed. Didn't she used to see yourself,

17:51.860 --> 17:56.140
you said as a romantic and the humanoids were bad, but then you altered that?

17:56.500 --> 18:03.200
Well, I think so. That is at one level, since the humanoids are machines, the perfect machine

18:03.200 --> 18:11.080
as originally stated, the theme, the perfect machine would be perfectly dreadful because

18:11.080 --> 18:21.380
it would take away all human freedom and responsibility and opportunity for achievement, but as I came

18:21.380 --> 18:30.120
to look at the story more, it seemed to me the essential human conflict in it is the conflict

18:30.120 --> 18:41.420
between the individual and society and the people in the stories are in a complex and

18:41.420 --> 18:47.740
painful emotional situation because the humanoids are meant to be good, they are presented as

18:47.740 --> 18:55.520
benign, they are trying to assure the safety and happiness of mankind and in doing this

18:55.520 --> 19:01.460
they destroy freedom and I decided eventually that this reflects my own very early childhood

19:01.460 --> 19:07.580
experience when people were overprotecting me because they loved me for my own good,

19:07.580 --> 19:12.580
but still I couldn't help with deep resentment because they wouldn't let me do so many things

19:12.580 --> 19:20.400
I wanted to do and I feel by the way that the conflict between the individual and society

19:20.400 --> 19:28.980
is a basic material of most literature really. You can approach it in all sorts of ways.

19:29.660 --> 19:36.460
At one level, why literature socializes as it teaches us unselfishness and patriotism

19:36.460 --> 19:48.280
and obedience and all sorts of social virtues and at another level why it can be critical

19:48.280 --> 19:55.600
of the influence of society on the individual as in Ebersen especially he presents character

19:55.600 --> 20:02.080
after character who is destroyed by the pressures of society or by conceding too much to society.

20:02.940 --> 20:10.460
In that novel the humanoids of Iron Smith it seemed to me represented society or conformity

20:10.460 --> 20:15.580
and so forth. When I first read the book I kept thinking he was going to turn into an evil

20:15.580 --> 20:21.960
character of villain but you never made him a villain. He remained a friendly person, a

20:21.960 --> 20:27.100
helpful person but simply one who was siding with the humanoids. Has your attitude changed?

20:27.280 --> 20:32.460
Well I think maybe I understand him better. When I was writing the novel I don't think I really

20:32.460 --> 20:40.580
understood him except that he was a fascinating enigma that is he was a likeable guy, he wasn't

20:40.580 --> 20:49.060
caught up in the conflict that my main character was. He got along with the humanoids and they befriended

20:49.060 --> 20:57.940
them, they befriended him and it occurred to me later that he's the example of the person who does conform

20:57.940 --> 21:06.060
to society who accepts its limitations and as a result of that is unable to live a more relaxed

21:06.060 --> 21:16.000
and richer life in contrast to the person always in conflict with society who in the worst instance

21:16.000 --> 21:19.360
has to destroy himself because nobody can live alone.

21:19.920 --> 21:26.220
If you were to continue with the humanoid, you know further than you have the humanoid stories,

21:27.240 --> 21:33.300
would you ultimately have them man being happy under their care? Would they stop conquering the universe?

21:33.300 --> 21:44.520
Well I haven't planned to do that. In fact I was reluctant to write any more about them until Fred

21:44.520 --> 21:53.300
Poll offered me a contract I couldn't refuse but in this new novel the humanoid touch where I tried to

21:53.300 --> 22:03.380
work out an alternative that doesn't involve the destruction of the humanoids but does offer an alternate way

22:03.380 --> 22:13.680
of life that isn't escaped from and I don't know how readers will react but the story, I enjoyed writing

22:13.680 --> 22:16.440
and I have hopes for it.

22:16.620 --> 22:20.740
Well you must have, when you finish the humanoids with folded hands, say when you finish with folded hands

22:20.740 --> 22:26.660
in that time period, you must have gotten some response from readers or editors that was kind of pessimistic

22:26.660 --> 22:29.760
or dystopian because you wrote the equalizer, didn't you, as sort of a counter?

22:30.060 --> 22:39.840
Well more or less in fact the folded hands, the humanoid stories were the first project that I undertook

22:39.840 --> 22:47.800
after I got home from World War II. I was an Air Force's weather forecaster in the southwest Pacific

22:47.800 --> 22:54.720
when the bomb went off and the atomic bomb cast a dark mushroom cloud over all science fiction

22:54.720 --> 23:05.960
and much science fiction was suddenly pessimistic about the future and thus this was the setting in which

23:05.960 --> 23:12.120
I wrote the humanoids and when I started to write it I originally felt that they could be somehow

23:12.120 --> 23:18.960
conquered or disposed of or whatever and then as I worked with them I realized that logically

23:18.960 --> 23:27.940
and artistically they were invincible and so I gave up in the middle of a, before I got to the middle

23:27.940 --> 23:40.360
of a novel I had planned and wrote the equalizer as an example of, let's say that technology is benevolent

23:40.360 --> 23:47.740
and it can be used to make a really better world and then I came back to the humanoids

23:47.740 --> 23:50.320
and re-plotted it and wrote the folded hands.

23:51.240 --> 23:57.200
I would just have one more question on the humanoid books, the humanoid material.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.360
I guess some of the readers, some responses I've read about it have been kind of confused

24:03.360 --> 24:06.520
or on both sides of the question as to what you meant.

24:06.780 --> 24:14.760
My concern would be are you optimistic about man and his future and his relation to machines?

24:14.940 --> 24:20.000
Can you control them? Can he survive them? Are they going to destroy him and his nature?

24:20.280 --> 24:25.460
Well, I think I'm optimistic. I try to be optimistic.

24:25.940 --> 24:31.160
I think that once we have technology we can't unhive it.

24:31.160 --> 24:36.420
If we can't put the genie back in the bottle we have to accept it and live with it.

24:36.560 --> 24:43.640
I think that people who want to return to the 18th century or to the Garden of Eden or whatever

24:44.160 --> 24:51.100
are simply trying to whistle in the dark and I think that technology can solve problems

24:51.100 --> 24:53.460
if we use it to solve problems.

24:53.460 --> 24:59.140
So I'm more optimistic than my stories.

24:59.360 --> 25:06.280
I think that to a considerable extent a story should have its own independent theme

25:06.280 --> 25:11.560
more or less independently of what the writer thinks or believes

25:11.560 --> 25:16.120
when I'm trying to write a story where I like to stop after I have a reasonable start

25:16.120 --> 25:23.560
and look at it and decide what the theme is and then rearrange it if necessary

25:23.560 --> 25:27.160
to give it the strongest impact I can.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.180
Do you have any questions in this area, David?

25:32.380 --> 25:35.880
Not about the humanoids. I have one backing up a little bit.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.300
It seems that many of your stories have anticipated scientific discoveries

25:40.300 --> 25:43.480
such as Dark Star Station anticipated neutron stars.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.380
How did you get the ideas about that?

25:46.000 --> 25:51.240
Well, it's hard to say except that I've always been fascinated with sciences.

25:52.180 --> 25:58.560
Well, you can put it as a sort of mystery story of what the world is,

25:58.660 --> 26:03.220
the universe is about its origins and development and meaning

26:03.220 --> 26:09.460
with effort going on in a hundred fields of science to unravel the mystery

26:09.460 --> 26:16.840
and I've always tried to read science magazines and science books

26:16.840 --> 26:23.820
and keep up with what's happening and I'm concerned with what the universe is

26:23.820 --> 26:32.920
and sometimes I had speculation through my own that we're later confirmed, let's say.

26:36.780 --> 26:40.840
I notice a number of stories and in some of your novels,

26:40.960 --> 26:45.080
especially in the late 30s, early 40s, where you described totalitarian kind of societies

26:45.080 --> 26:50.640
like Breakdown, that story I think with the Square Deal, if I remember correctly,

26:50.880 --> 26:57.100
in that area where the humans are struggling to overcome a sort of a totalitarian society,

26:57.520 --> 26:59.560
was that in any way related to the world situation?

26:59.560 --> 27:04.000
Well, I think so. At that time, of course, we were faced with Hitler

27:04.000 --> 27:12.860
and a little bit later with Stalin and I think there were too many stories

27:12.860 --> 27:19.920
of that time that placed us in a struggle with a totalitarian situation

27:20.560 --> 27:26.980
and of course that is sort of an ultimate statement of the problem of the society

27:26.980 --> 27:30.820
versus the individual, the individual being destroyed,

27:31.340 --> 27:39.960
at least his freedom erased by a totally arbitrary society.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.540
If I'm remembering correctly that story Breakdown,

27:46.060 --> 27:52.020
that the one where Boss Kellen was in control and his son wanted to go to the stars,

27:52.160 --> 27:55.300
the research, and the boss had stayed on the earth, forget that.

27:55.300 --> 27:59.220
I took that as very characteristic of your fiction,

27:59.420 --> 28:02.700
that you have to have a goal, a challenge, you have to keep wanting to go,

28:03.520 --> 28:08.340
rather than be structured and restricted in a society.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.260
Kind of something to look forward to to try for.

28:11.500 --> 28:17.180
Well, I think we all need goals and promises and escapes and freedom

28:17.180 --> 28:21.660
and realization of possibility and so forth.

28:21.660 --> 28:27.960
It seems to me that, well, we're caught in this paradoxical situation

28:27.960 --> 28:33.280
between the needs of the individual and the demands of the society

28:33.280 --> 28:35.260
and we can't live completely alone.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.740
We have to have the support and love and so forth of other people

28:40.740 --> 28:44.860
but if society demands too much, it's destructive.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.980
So there's no final answer to it.

28:48.060 --> 28:55.300
It's a matter of precarious set of compromises that goes on as long as we live.

28:55.620 --> 28:59.440
And some people make compromises more successful than others.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.820
I did my dissertation on H.G. Wells,

29:03.140 --> 29:07.020
who I think was a very successful compromiser with society,

29:07.240 --> 29:11.460
who lived a very rich and varied life

29:11.460 --> 29:16.040
and enjoyed the love of many gifted women and so on and so forth

29:16.040 --> 29:21.740
in contrast with a friend of his named Gissing, George Gissing,

29:21.860 --> 29:26.560
wasn't it who met society

29:26.560 --> 29:31.060
or tried to head on and died young and bitter and poor and defeated?

29:31.880 --> 29:35.100
Yeah, didn't you sort of, if I remember one place, you sort of care,

29:35.220 --> 29:38.680
you didn't say this but I got the impression Gissing was the, say, the forester type

29:38.680 --> 29:40.980
in the humanoids and Wells was more the Iron Smith type?

29:41.380 --> 29:44.660
Well, that fits my own notion, so I don't know if I ever said it.

29:45.620 --> 29:49.620
Did you take Wells to be pessimistic or about man's future progress?

29:49.660 --> 29:57.360
Well, I did my dissertation on Wells entitled H.G. Wells' Critic of Progress

29:57.360 --> 30:03.920
and it seems to me that he has, there saying in several ways

30:03.920 --> 30:09.340
that progress is not all we'd like it to be,

30:09.900 --> 30:16.680
that our universe is, hostile is certainly not friendly to progress

30:16.680 --> 30:22.600
and that we have a barrier in the animal nature of mankind

30:22.600 --> 30:26.200
which he explores into such things as the island of Dr. Moro

30:26.780 --> 30:30.480
and then a further notion that progress limits itself,

30:30.480 --> 30:36.180
that is, as an evolutionary struggle and I think Wells was Darwinian,

30:36.820 --> 30:41.520
if you stop struggling you sink back

30:41.520 --> 30:45.820
so you never can reach an ultimate peak and stay there.

30:46.280 --> 30:53.520
But on the other hand, Wells must have had hope for something better

30:53.520 --> 30:58.580
because he spent most of his life in a struggle to build a better society,

30:58.580 --> 31:04.640
to educate us and warn us and shape us for a world state

31:04.640 --> 31:09.840
and he died, I think, more or less in bitter and despair

31:09.840 --> 31:16.240
but still it seems to me that most of his life was lived in hope.

31:20.260 --> 31:22.020
I want to ask you a little bit too.

31:22.980 --> 31:27.160
It's fascinating to me the way science fiction caught on and began

31:27.160 --> 31:28.860
through the thirties and so forth.

31:30.240 --> 31:34.360
Around 1939, if I remember, people like Asimov and Heinlein

31:34.360 --> 31:37.140
and I think it's pronounced Van Boe, is that right?

31:37.140 --> 31:37.800
Van Boeut.

31:37.940 --> 31:38.680
Van Boeut, okay.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.600
They started publishing around that time.

31:40.780 --> 31:43.580
Were you reading these people as they started?

31:43.760 --> 31:49.760
Oh yes, they all started in Kamal's magazine astounding.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.680
He was, well, I don't know whether you'd say,

31:52.680 --> 31:55.720
he Kamal discovered them or they discovered him

31:55.720 --> 32:04.180
but it was, let's say, a small group with a great deal of well fellowship

32:04.180 --> 32:08.920
or fellow understanding and so forth

32:08.920 --> 32:13.260
and it was an exciting period in which to be alive.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.660
In 1940, I spent about a year in Los Angeles

32:17.660 --> 32:24.460
when I spent many Saturday evenings up at Bob Hanlon's home

32:24.460 --> 32:28.720
and on Laurel Canyon in Hollywood

32:28.720 --> 32:33.080
when we had what we called the Manana Literary Society.

32:33.380 --> 32:37.880
It was not an organization, it was just a group of friends

32:37.880 --> 32:40.740
but we got together and talked science fiction

32:40.740 --> 32:43.920
and we were all reading each other science fiction

32:43.920 --> 32:45.000
when it was published

32:45.000 --> 32:49.720
and the field was a lot closer knit than it is now

32:49.720 --> 32:52.780
because everybody could read all that anybody published

32:52.780 --> 32:56.620
and it was a little group and we were much closer together

32:56.620 --> 32:59.840
and by and large we were friends.

33:01.040 --> 33:06.680
Have you kept up personal, well I guess as president

33:07.460 --> 33:10.020
AFWA and so forth, for SWA?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.320
SFWA, Science Fiction and Writers of America.

33:13.320 --> 33:18.960
Well, I still have a lot of old friendships and make new friends

33:18.960 --> 33:23.720
but we have upwards of 500 members in the organization

33:23.720 --> 33:29.940
and nearly all of them have published at least a few stories

33:29.940 --> 33:35.880
and publishers, paperback publishers,

33:36.260 --> 33:40.540
send me probably 20 or 30 free books a month

33:40.540 --> 33:43.280
and most of these I don't have time to read

33:43.280 --> 33:48.760
so I have old friends that I try to keep in touch with,

33:48.860 --> 33:54.140
keep up with but it's impossible for anybody to be as intimately acquainted

33:54.140 --> 33:59.020
with all the field as we all were in the 30s and 40s

33:59.720 --> 34:06.360
but we still have a fellowship sort of subculture

34:06.360 --> 34:11.420
that draws us together in a way that doesn't happen

34:11.420 --> 34:16.540
to readers of Mystery or Westerns or whatever

34:16.540 --> 34:21.380
and it seems to me that basically it's a concern with science

34:21.380 --> 34:25.260
and technology and the impact on human beings

34:25.260 --> 34:28.360
and technology and the future that we have.

34:29.740 --> 34:32.360
Not a realization that the world is changing

34:32.360 --> 34:35.260
and a concern about what the future is going to be like

34:35.260 --> 34:41.200
that the laymen or the mundane as people call them

34:41.920 --> 34:47.340
try to forget maybe because if they see change at all they're afraid of it.

34:47.780 --> 34:52.980
Yeah, I read that when you were younger you were sort of anti-nuclear power

34:52.980 --> 34:55.560
and your position on that has changed over the years.

34:56.280 --> 35:01.300
Well, I'm certainly pro-nuclear power now.

35:02.080 --> 35:06.360
I'm not sure that I was ever strongly against it

35:06.360 --> 35:10.920
except that when I heard that the atom had been split

35:10.920 --> 35:15.780
where I was sort of dismayed, I had known that it was possible

35:15.780 --> 35:19.500
I'd written fiction about it as early as 1930

35:19.500 --> 35:24.460
but I saw that it was going to make life complicated

35:24.460 --> 35:26.860
and I wish that it hadn't happened in my time

35:26.860 --> 35:31.440
but now since we have nuclear power it seems to me

35:31.440 --> 35:36.880
it's the safest and most necessary development that I can see.

35:37.440 --> 35:42.240
You talk about contrasting mind and coal and nuclear power

35:42.240 --> 35:47.980
when you mine coal you bring out a lot of uranium and thorium along with it

35:47.980 --> 35:51.320
when you burn it while you pollute the atmosphere with a lot more radiation

35:51.320 --> 35:54.360
than has ever escaped from a nuclear plant.

35:54.360 --> 35:59.320
You kill people in the mines and on the railways and so on and so forth

35:59.320 --> 36:03.840
so that nobody to the best of my knowledge has yet been killed

36:03.840 --> 36:06.480
in a commercial nuclear accident

36:06.480 --> 36:12.800
and when we were developing steam boat boats on the Mississippi

36:12.800 --> 36:17.100
where we blew up people every few days and nobody thought much about it

36:17.100 --> 36:21.380
so it seems to me we have a sort of exaggerated fear

36:21.380 --> 36:30.980
of nuclear hazards and unwillingness to open our eyes

36:30.980 --> 36:32.660
and balance the realities

36:33.380 --> 36:40.320
and we can produce and use nuclear energy nowadays

36:40.320 --> 36:48.200
and whatever else we do is going to be more expensive

36:48.200 --> 36:50.640
or more dangerous or delayed or whatever

36:51.060 --> 36:54.560
that is space power plants, solar power or whatever

36:55.200 --> 36:58.360
offer glittering possibilities for the next century

36:58.360 --> 37:02.240
but they can't do much for us in the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.420
Change the subject for just a minute.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.120
How did you start to collaborate with Frederick Paul?

37:08.720 --> 37:13.820
Well at that time Fred was my agent and I sent him material

37:13.820 --> 37:19.860
and he suggested things that could be done with it.

37:20.200 --> 37:24.620
The first instance was something that I called the conquest of the abyss.

37:24.740 --> 37:28.560
I started out to write a novel about an undersea world

37:28.560 --> 37:33.440
and I pinned a bed sheet on the wall, I made maps, I did research

37:33.440 --> 37:39.120
I described the technologies and invented people and culture and a setup

37:39.120 --> 37:42.880
and I got about halfway through what was meant to be the novel

37:42.880 --> 37:47.220
it just died, I used up all my creativity and planning it

37:47.220 --> 37:53.040
and when Fred came in we got three undersea novels about it

37:53.040 --> 37:57.300
and our reefs of space came about more or less the same way

37:57.300 --> 38:02.460
though somewhat later I had written a 400 page draft

38:02.460 --> 38:04.660
of something called the iron collar man

38:04.660 --> 38:10.580
that had the reefs of space and all the essential background in it

38:10.580 --> 38:14.440
but I wasn't happy with it, I never did do a final draft

38:14.440 --> 38:19.340
and when I showed it to Fred we replotted it and he rewrote it

38:19.340 --> 38:23.320
and it was a very successful revision

38:23.320 --> 38:27.160
speaking of anticipating science

38:27.160 --> 38:32.020
it took a long time to get that into print

38:32.020 --> 38:37.960
and I was afraid that people wouldn't start doing organ transplants too soon

38:37.960 --> 38:42.380
but we did beat the heart transplanters at least by a few years

38:42.380 --> 38:46.040
you're speaking of the body bank in that one?

38:46.100 --> 38:50.460
that was a lot of fun to do and I had the body bank in my version

38:50.460 --> 38:57.420
but Fred came up with a lot of delightfully horrifying variations

38:57.420 --> 38:59.500
and possibilities of the body bank

38:59.500 --> 39:02.780
had you run across that in fiction before to your knowledge or is that the first time you've heard of it?

39:02.780 --> 39:09.420
well so far as I knew it was near the body bank was certainly a new phrase to me

39:11.940 --> 39:18.780
I'm still curious how, I've never understood how someone can say collaborate on a novel

39:18.780 --> 39:20.460
how does that work in your relationship with you?

39:20.460 --> 39:25.320
well first of all a collaboration is a pretty intimate relationship

39:25.320 --> 39:30.480
sort of like a marriage it doesn't work unless you have a mutual trust

39:30.880 --> 39:35.280
and preferably both parties should have complementary abilities

39:35.280 --> 39:36.820
so each one can add something

39:36.820 --> 39:43.520
I've collaborated with several people and always because I felt that they could do something I couldn't

39:43.940 --> 39:47.380
the first collaboration was with the Dr. Miles J Brewer

39:48.280 --> 39:53.920
something like 50 years ago we wrote a novel together as well as a short story

39:53.920 --> 39:59.180
and a novel that I just re-read and in some ways I thought it was pretty good

39:59.180 --> 40:07.280
and I kind of apprenticed myself to Brewer who was selling to Amazing a couple of years ahead of me

40:07.280 --> 40:13.800
and when you look at him now he wasn't a really brilliant writer

40:13.800 --> 40:19.100
but he was competent and serious and took his techniques seriously

40:19.100 --> 40:26.140
and he knew things that I wanted to learn and I did the writing and most of the writing

40:26.140 --> 40:31.100
and he helped with the plotting and suggested revisions and whatever

40:31.100 --> 40:39.240
and with Fred I well respect him and first of all I like him

40:39.240 --> 40:47.300
and then I respect his style, his editorial sense and his craftsmanship generally

40:47.300 --> 40:58.080
and when I'm working with someone like Fred I think a writer needs an audience

40:58.080 --> 41:00.500
that is communication is a two-way process

41:00.500 --> 41:05.040
you need to know your audience and then need feedback from your audience

41:05.040 --> 41:08.740
and I'm doing a first drive for someone like Fred

41:08.740 --> 41:12.980
since I know him it gives a kind of automatic focus

41:13.550 --> 41:18.220
it helps crystallize the point of view

41:18.220 --> 41:21.640
it makes the writing go a lot faster

41:22.360 --> 41:26.900
especially since I know that he's going to do the final drive

41:26.900 --> 41:30.500
I don't have to worry about literary polish

41:30.500 --> 41:34.100
the literations or avoiding rhyming words

41:34.100 --> 41:37.940
and I'm going to read to Fred and write down what comes

41:37.940 --> 41:41.820
and trust him to redo it

41:41.820 --> 41:45.440
In other words in your relationship with him

41:45.440 --> 41:49.680
you sort of get the ideas in the first draft and he does the revision and polishing

41:49.680 --> 41:51.200
basically it

41:51.200 --> 41:54.980
and that was a trilogy, you mentioned the Reese's space

41:54.980 --> 41:56.180
that was a trilogy if I recall

41:56.180 --> 41:57.580
the third book was Rogue Star

42:00.420 --> 42:03.640
one of the ideas that fascinated me in that book

42:03.640 --> 42:05.480
I think it was also in the second book Star Child

42:05.480 --> 42:08.000
the concept of Ascension Star

42:08.300 --> 42:11.560
and combining that with the intelligence with the human intelligence

42:11.560 --> 42:16.120
that was an idea that appealed to me tremendously

42:17.480 --> 42:21.000
and I'm not sure where I got it

42:21.000 --> 42:24.300
Sturgeon wrote a story long ago called Kill Doja

42:24.300 --> 42:30.320
about a sentient thing that seized a bulldozer

42:30.320 --> 42:36.660
and my original notion for the story was to begin with the creation of a mind

42:36.660 --> 42:41.900
that could, let's say, possess matter

42:41.900 --> 42:46.100
could store intelligence I think

42:46.100 --> 42:50.300
and shifting electronic spins or whatever

42:50.300 --> 42:54.940
I had a technique and I wanted to tell the story completely

42:54.940 --> 42:59.740
from the viewpoint of the creature that was made in the laboratory

42:59.740 --> 43:03.580
and enlarged itself successively

43:03.580 --> 43:06.260
until it became the mind of a star

43:06.260 --> 43:09.520
and I did the first draft of the story that way

43:10.240 --> 43:15.120
but Fred didn't like it, felt that it wasn't successful

43:15.120 --> 43:22.400
and so he had me do some more material from viewpoints of the human characters

43:22.400 --> 43:28.380
and the stories it published had shifting points of view

43:28.380 --> 43:34.000
and that's one collaboration that I've always a little bit regretted

43:34.000 --> 43:38.040
because I felt that the way I wanted to do it

43:38.040 --> 43:41.980
from the viewpoint of the alien could have been done

43:41.980 --> 43:47.320
and would have been something more original and difficult

43:47.320 --> 43:48.860
or maybe harder to do

43:50.360 --> 43:53.780
but it worked out very well as a collaboration

43:53.780 --> 44:00.060
and evidently there was something less than successful about my first draft

44:00.060 --> 44:02.020
of Fred wouldn't have wanted to change it

44:03.340 --> 44:04.960
Do you have any questions right now, Debra?

44:05.260 --> 44:07.140
No, I'm fascinated so far

44:10.560 --> 44:14.200
Every once in a while I see portions of your stories, your novels

44:14.200 --> 44:19.540
that are being serialized in books like Galaxy or Amazing or Analog and so forth

44:20.120 --> 44:23.320
and there's one I've read partially but I haven't found the rest of it

44:23.320 --> 44:25.680
the one on Black Lantern and Snow Fire

44:27.120 --> 44:31.580
That was published as the power of blackness

44:31.580 --> 44:36.460
It was three, five novelettes put together

44:36.460 --> 44:39.600
three of them right in the magazine to find us in science fiction

44:41.520 --> 44:44.580
and I guess one in Galaxy and one in Amazing

44:45.180 --> 44:50.700
One thing I saw, it seemed to me especially as a teacher of English

44:50.700 --> 44:52.600
I guess I look for symbolism in some places

44:52.600 --> 44:57.620
that Black Lantern seemed to me to represent say the third world, the oppressed

44:57.620 --> 45:01.520
the Africans, the Latin Americans, a black man from the streets

45:01.520 --> 45:03.140
Well, I think so

45:03.140 --> 45:10.060
My original notion in the story was to write a sort of thought experiment

45:10.620 --> 45:20.460
to set up a story situation that would be a task of primitivism versus progress

45:20.460 --> 45:25.540
in all the theme of primitivism is something that we as teachers of literature

45:25.540 --> 45:29.680
would like to discover in William Faulkner or whatever

45:30.320 --> 45:35.440
and what I did in the story was to set up the planet Ngonka

45:35.440 --> 45:43.260
which was settled many thousand years ago by refugees from a wrecked spaceship

45:43.260 --> 45:49.920
who fell back into savagery on a hard world so that they developed a very primitive society

45:49.920 --> 45:55.780
Meanwhile the galactic civilization continued to evolve

45:55.780 --> 46:04.840
so that Ngonka rediscovered where we have, let's say, an ultimately sophisticated technology

46:04.840 --> 46:09.840
in contrast with more or less ultimate primitivism

46:09.840 --> 46:17.920
and Black Lantern is presented as a member of the primitive society

46:17.920 --> 46:20.720
in conflict with the other society

46:20.720 --> 46:25.940
and at that time I was still teaching school so I did the thing as a series of novellets

46:25.940 --> 46:29.020
so I just a way of getting it written and published

46:29.020 --> 46:34.920
and it probably lacks unity and I feel myself at the middle section of it

46:34.920 --> 46:37.980
it's probably better than the two concluding sections

46:38.640 --> 46:42.220
Did you mean for one of the characters in that story, I think his name was Toul Smith

46:42.680 --> 46:47.220
Did you mean for him to be the same as Iron Smith because he does speak for the computer, the machine?

46:47.760 --> 46:48.720
Well, more or less

46:49.760 --> 46:53.940
I wonder, especially the similarity of name and the way they thought

46:54.660 --> 47:00.220
Well, he's certainly a representative of the technological culture

47:00.220 --> 47:05.380
Would Snowfire have any, I guess I want to say symbolic value although that's not quite the word

47:06.860 --> 47:11.540
Well, I wanted a romance, a love interest

47:11.540 --> 47:17.500
and she appealed to me as a sophisticated, civilized person

47:17.500 --> 47:24.120
and in contact with the savage on his way up

47:24.120 --> 47:27.740
and I felt that there would be electricity between them

47:27.740 --> 47:31.960
The name probably is not too successful

47:32.740 --> 47:36.260
I thought it was sort of striking or appealing at the time

47:36.260 --> 47:37.760
but people have sneered at it

47:37.760 --> 47:40.320
You didn't mean for black and snow, black land or something?

47:40.320 --> 47:43.060
Well, yes, that was part of it

47:43.060 --> 47:46.720
but it's maybe too obvious, let's say
