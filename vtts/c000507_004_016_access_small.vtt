Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:33.740 --> 00:38.100
And here are your hosts.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.420
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lange.

00:45.660 --> 00:49.580
Warren Norwood, a newly emerged science fiction writer who was a finalist in the balloting

00:49.580 --> 00:54.500
for the 1983 John W. Campbell Award, the award given annually to the best new writer.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.500
Norwood hit the scene with his first novel in a series dubbed The Windhover Tapes.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.640
Volume 1 is an image of voices.

01:00.980 --> 01:02.500
Volume 2, flexing the warp.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.200
And Volume 3, fies of the Gabriel Ratchets.

01:05.480 --> 01:10.080
The protagonist is Gerard Manley, a space-faring diplomat who journeys in a sentient craft

01:10.080 --> 01:11.100
called The Windhover.

01:11.540 --> 01:15.480
We asked Norwood if by any coincidence the series had anything to do with Gerard Manley

01:15.480 --> 01:17.900
Hopkins, the 19th century English poet.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.800
Yeah, it's my left-handed salute to the old man.

01:20.900 --> 01:24.080
I mean, I think he was a poet who was probably 100 years ahead of his time.

01:27.820 --> 01:31.580
He's not one of those poets that you walk around reciting verses to at people's and

01:31.580 --> 01:32.280
being parties.

01:32.940 --> 01:37.700
But I think he did marvelous, I think he took marvelous chances with the language and marvelous

01:37.700 --> 01:38.820
chances with poetry.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.580
And some of it is just, you know, it's breathtaking.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.800
But no one's going to read a tribute to Gerard Manley Hopkins.

01:47.100 --> 01:55.340
So, when I sat down to do the story, I had already decided that I was going to name the

01:55.340 --> 01:58.440
ship Windhover, which is his most famous poem, The Windhover.

01:59.780 --> 02:03.120
And it just seemed, you know, the natural thing to do, the name the character Gerard

02:03.120 --> 02:06.320
Manley, especially since he is interested in poetry, right?

02:06.760 --> 02:13.620
And then in the second book, when Gerard finds himself at the end of his road and thinks

02:13.620 --> 02:15.380
this is going to be it, it's going to be all over.

02:15.380 --> 02:19.040
He writes a poem to GM, which is himself, right?

02:19.160 --> 02:21.940
But it's also the poem to Gerard Manley Hopkins.

02:23.060 --> 02:29.100
And it echoes the language of the Windhover, Hopkins the Windhover.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.540
It echoes that language and asks some of the same questions only from Gerard's point of

02:34.540 --> 02:36.140
view rather than from Hopkins' point of view.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.940
So yeah, it's all very intentional.

02:38.140 --> 02:42.040
I mean, with 54-hour minor in English, it's hard to be unintentional about things like

02:42.040 --> 02:42.280
that.

02:43.660 --> 02:47.620
So the series is filled with all sorts of illusions to Hopkins that should please any English

02:47.620 --> 02:47.880
major.

02:48.380 --> 02:51.140
We were curious about the type of audience at which Norwood was aiming.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.280
After all, not all readers are English majors.

02:53.860 --> 02:58.920
I think it was Raymond Chandler, but I'm not sure who said that I write first to entertain

02:58.920 --> 03:00.740
myself and hope that others are entertained.

03:02.900 --> 03:07.860
I had a certain audience awareness in that when I went back and did the second draft,

03:07.860 --> 03:16.300
I simplified the language somewhat from the original draft because I thought I had gotten

03:16.300 --> 03:17.140
too carried away.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.200
But I didn't write it thinking of a specific audience.

03:23.860 --> 03:27.880
For those books, I really didn't have an audience in mind.

03:27.980 --> 03:31.180
It was just a story that I had been thinking about for eight or nine months, and I wanted

03:31.180 --> 03:31.620
to tell.

03:32.120 --> 03:37.400
And that seemed more important.

03:37.620 --> 03:43.240
And then when I made the decision about how to tell the story, I knew without deliberating

03:43.240 --> 03:46.860
on it a great deal that I had limited my audience.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.540
But I thought, well, I'm willing to take the chance because I figured I needed something

03:50.540 --> 03:51.640
to break into the market.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.160
And I think you have to take chances to do that.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.160
Manly is a galactic diplomat in an image of voices, although he abandons this role in

04:09.160 --> 04:10.040
the subsequent novels.

04:10.500 --> 04:15.580
Say galactic diplomat to a science fiction fan and he'll respond, Ratif, meaning Keith

04:15.580 --> 04:16.780
Laumer's famous protagonist.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.340
We asked Norwood if Ratif influenced the character of Gerard Manly.

04:20.880 --> 04:31.600
I tried not to make Gerard not like Ratif, while still maintaining that he was a great

04:31.620 --> 04:33.080
intergalactic diplomat role.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.060
I tried to make him a very different kind of diplomat.

04:37.920 --> 04:42.700
But there were times, in fact, in the first draft, there are sections where it got a little

04:42.700 --> 04:47.140
Ratif-like kind of unconsciously, and then I had to go back and say, gee, I think I read

04:47.140 --> 04:48.660
this somewhere before, and I didn't write it.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.680
And then you have to go back and clean things up.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.420
More with Warren Norwood on our next show.

05:00.440 --> 05:05.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:05.300 --> 05:09.160
Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.580 --> 05:56.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.540 --> 06:17.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.220
And here are your hosts.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.480
This is Daryl Ayn.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.240
And Bill Vernon.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.000
The cover on each novel in Warren Norwood's Science Fiction series, The Windhover Tapes,

06:32.180 --> 06:36.080
features a complimentary blurb written by Anne McCaffrey, the author of the famous Dragon Books.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.520
McCaffrey wrote in a blurb on the back of the first novel, An Image of Voices, that she

06:40.520 --> 06:42.620
had known of Norwood's ambitions for four years.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.460
We asked Norwood about his relationship with Anne McCaffrey.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.260
I was a book salesman for Ballantine.

06:48.860 --> 06:53.480
And Ballantine Delray did the McCaffrey Dragon Books, among others.

06:54.540 --> 07:00.680
And when she did the first promotion tour around the country for the hardcover edition of White Dragon,

07:01.780 --> 07:07.360
I cornered the Delray direct salesman and said, if you don't get her into some of my wholesale accounts,

07:07.560 --> 07:09.140
you know, I'm going to break your knees.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.060
Besides, I want to meet her.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.180
I mean, there's other reasons besides.

07:13.180 --> 07:18.320
So I got her into, I think, three of the accounts, and then we took her to the airport together,

07:18.320 --> 07:20.420
and her plane was an hour and a half late.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.820
So we sat in the bar in the airport drinking Coors Beer, which is one of her favorites,

07:24.900 --> 07:30.080
and she can't get in Ireland, and listening to Annie Tell Stories, which is a marvelous experience

07:30.080 --> 07:30.740
in and of itself.

07:31.700 --> 07:38.100
When she came back the following year for the paperback tour for White Dragon, my wife and I picked her up

07:38.100 --> 07:42.820
at the airport, took her to the hotel in Dallas, which was on fire at the time, so that was all very exciting.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.060
She was extremely tired.

07:45.180 --> 07:51.000
It was the 23rd day of a 28-day tour in 31 cities or something like that, and she was beginning.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.600
So we ended up staying until like one or two o'clock in the morning because she couldn't sleep

07:55.600 --> 08:02.380
and just talking and chatting, and then I took her around all the next day with a case of Coors Beer iced down in the back

08:02.380 --> 08:07.900
and about three melons all diced up because you can't get fresh melon in Ireland either, right?

08:07.900 --> 08:11.700
So she munched on melon and drank Coors Beer all day while we toured Dallas and Fort Worth

08:11.700 --> 08:15.960
and visited bookstores and radio stations and developed a grand rapport and ended up at the airport

08:15.960 --> 08:18.160
drinking Coors Beer and having a wonderful time.

08:18.820 --> 08:25.100
So we corresponded then fairly regularly, I say fairly regularly, three or four times a year after that,

08:25.620 --> 08:29.720
and after I finished the book and Bantam had bought it, they said, you know, who do you know?

08:30.020 --> 08:35.640
And I said, well, the author I know best is Anne McCaffrey, and so I asked her, I said, you know, would you read it?

08:36.060 --> 08:41.200
And she said yes. And then she said those wonderful things, and I don't remember anything for about a week

08:41.200 --> 08:42.500
after getting that letter, you know.

08:43.820 --> 08:51.540
Annie's letter was as much of a high as the sale, right, because it was some kind of confirmation that I had in fact done it right.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.560
It was as much of a high as the sale was itself.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.820
The bookstores and radio stations were in the same place.

09:07.940 --> 09:11.140
The bookstores and radio stations were in the same place.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.380
Norwood originally envisioned the Windhover tapes as a trilogy, and he wrote it as such.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.160
But then it was announced later that the series would be four books long, a totrology.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.800
We asked Norwood why the change.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.200
Anne McCaffrey, it's Anne McCaffrey's fault, I'm not going to blame it on Annie.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.380
She wrote after she has read all the books in manuscript now.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.920
When after she finished the third book, she wrote me this long, long letter asking me this whole list of questions.

09:45.080 --> 09:54.320
She said, you have answered all the main questions in the story, I'm not objecting to that, but I want to know this, and I want to know that, and I want to know this, and I want to know that, and are you ever going to talk about this, and are you ever going to talk about that?

09:54.780 --> 09:57.720
And she said, either write me a long letter back or write another book.

09:58.880 --> 10:10.400
So I laughingly shared that letter with my editor and started thinking about the answers to those questions, but it hadn't gotten beyond that point until the first book started to sell really well.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.440
And then my editor said, gee, you ought to think about the fourth book.

10:13.880 --> 10:19.120
And I said, well, the only way I'll do a fourth book if it's the final book, because I don't want an endless series.

10:19.820 --> 10:25.720
If I can make this the final book, and under these conditions, then I will write it, and I will answer Annie's question.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.080
So the fourth book is going to be to answer Annie's questions.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.620
That's what started the whole thing.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
It's Anne McCaffrey's fault.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.360
Bloods her heart.

10:35.940 --> 10:38.280
We'll have more with Warren Norwood on our next show.

10:45.440 --> 10:54.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.700
Thank you.

12:03.320 --> 12:08.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.900
And here are your hosts.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.400
This is Bill Vernon.

12:18.660 --> 12:19.260
And Daryl Lane.

12:19.260 --> 12:26.400
A number of people write poetry. They do so for various reasons, among them for escape, as a creative outlet, or for self-expression.

12:26.820 --> 12:31.740
Quite a few science fiction writers compose poetry as well. Gene Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, and Michael Bishop, for instance.

12:32.380 --> 12:36.060
But it's virtually impossible to make a living solely by writing and selling poetry.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.220
A few magazines and anthologies purchase poems, but the pay is a pittance.

12:40.780 --> 12:46.080
The poets among us must write it for love, not money. But one science fiction writer, Warren Norwood, has chosen a different tack.

12:46.080 --> 12:54.880
As we discussed previously, his Windhover series owes a lot to the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Norwood, a poet as well as a writer, inserts his own poems in his novels.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.820
Here he comments on this practice.

12:57.740 --> 13:04.520
Oh yes, yes. One of the motives up Borenda in the very beginning was to bootleg the poetry into the story.

13:05.420 --> 13:13.180
In fact, it was the tenderfoot cycle of poems which helped me formulate how I wanted to put the story together.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.300
And all the tenderfoot poems aren't in there, fortunately.

13:19.280 --> 13:27.620
But that was part of what I wanted to do in the books, because I thought, again, that was something else that was...

13:27.620 --> 13:33.620
I was taking enough chances. I thought, I'll take one more. I'll go ahead and try this and see what happens.

13:36.340 --> 13:40.700
I've been writing poetry since I was nine, so I obviously believe in it in some form or another.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.980
So I thought, why not do that and see if we can make it work?

13:45.260 --> 13:52.080
And I was very fortunate and found an editor who believed in it after having talked to several others who did not believe in it at all.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.000
We wondered if writing poetry helped Norwood write fiction.

13:56.760 --> 14:08.460
I think so because if you write poetry regularly and try constantly to improve it, and you're constantly working with the language,

14:08.460 --> 14:13.760
you're constantly trying to squeeze from the language as much meaning as possible.

14:13.960 --> 14:18.880
So it makes you extremely cognizant of words and their meanings and their subtleties and shades of meanings.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.540
I think that writing poetry can also hurt your prose.

14:25.320 --> 14:31.560
I think that you can, in fact, get too poetic. You're trying to put too much in. You're trying to make your prose too poetic.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.500
I marvel at some of the stuff that Gene Wolfe writes.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.820
I mean, I think some of his prose just blows me away.

14:42.660 --> 14:56.380
But at the same time, I think that sometimes he sticks with a level of writing that is almost too poetic for the part of the story he's trying to tell,

14:56.500 --> 15:02.860
that instead of doing it in rhythms, he's so caught up in that rhythm, so caught up in that level, that poetic level,

15:02.860 --> 15:11.600
that he can't bring it down to a faster, cleaner action scene where you get out of that and you sweep the reader along and then pull them back up to another poetic height.

15:12.380 --> 15:19.840
And so I think, you know, this is not to criticize Gene Wolfe, but it's to say that I think that because he is a poet,

15:20.800 --> 15:31.860
and because he is so poetically involved with the language, that it has detracted a little bit from what he might have otherwise done with the story.

15:31.860 --> 15:39.280
Of course, all this is envy on my part because if I could write prose like Gene Wolfe writes, I would be a very happy man.

15:40.700 --> 15:48.160
Gerard Manley, Norwood's protagonist in the Windhover tape series, analyzes poetry from many worlds in his spare time with the help of his sentient ship, Windhover.

15:48.300 --> 15:52.940
We asked Norwood if there are present day computers capable of analyzing poetry in the same fashion.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.580
Very crude ones at this stage of the game, but there's been work that's been done on that.

16:01.080 --> 16:11.000
Several universities have done experimental programming with programming computers to write poetry, programming computers to translate poetry,

16:12.700 --> 16:17.980
and it's all at a very crude level, so my extrapolation of that is a big stretch.

16:17.980 --> 16:25.340
But I thought, given the progress of technology that in 7,000 years it seemed reasonable that we'd figure out how to do it.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
We'll have more with Warren Norwood on our next show.

17:28.140 --> 17:32.100
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

17:48.060 --> 17:53.240
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.600
And here are your hosts.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.840
This is Daryl Lane.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.520
And Bill Vernon.

18:03.860 --> 18:08.080
Warren Norwood's series, the Windhover tapes, is an imaginative blend of hard science and characterization.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.940
The protagonist is Gerard Manley, a space-faring diplomat and scholar.

18:11.940 --> 18:18.240
Much of the verse 2 volumes is written in a unique style, internal dialogue between Manley and his self.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.800
Manley recalls dreams in the early volumes.

18:21.180 --> 18:26.540
These allow him to reconstruct his past, a past detailed in the third volume, Fies of the Gabriel Ratchets.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.660
We ask Norwood if he dreams as Manley does.

18:29.740 --> 18:40.280
I dreamed a great deal from the time I, well, from somewhere in the middle of Vietnam until about 6, 7 years afterward.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.480
And I think that's the major influence on Gerard's dreams.

18:44.560 --> 18:55.320
And they were very vivid and they were very recallable in the same way that he recalls them, where I could, they would start as fragments when I woke up and then I could pull them back.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.800
I could bring more pieces back into the dream.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.060
That kind of faded off after about 6, 7 years after I got back from Vietnam and I don't do nearly as much of it.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.820
But that's where it came from, that process came from.

19:08.820 --> 19:18.700
And then in Gerard's case, it's part of what he suspects and he's getting a mirror image of what was of a prescient talent.

19:19.200 --> 19:25.920
And his prescientism is in effect kind of turned around and giving him a way to look back into his past, warped by the mind-wipers.

19:47.100 --> 19:54.400
Norwood does not write science fiction in the lecture mode. Rather, he allows the context of the story to explain itself. He relies on other devices as well.

19:54.920 --> 20:01.540
I did what a great number of science fiction writers do and that is I built on what had gone before.

20:01.540 --> 20:11.880
And there's such a huge basis now of groundwork that has been done for us that we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining how this works and how that works.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.820
And you know, oh actually this warp takes us through techie on space, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

20:17.220 --> 20:23.320
We can just use key words and key concepts and the reader has already been grounded in that.

20:24.560 --> 20:31.840
And then you can spend more time telling the story instead of having more time explaining all the mechanical functions.

20:33.200 --> 20:39.360
There's a hard science, there's a big hard science story that I really want to write but I don't think I have the skills yet as a writer to do it.

20:39.420 --> 20:44.320
So I'm saving that one for when I'm better trained in my craft.

20:45.040 --> 20:52.480
We mentioned that Norwood's series is a character study as well. A good example is Norwood's treatment of mainly his relationship with his wife, Sheryl.

20:52.960 --> 21:01.020
Manly meets Sheryl early in the first volume in Image of Voices. She is a researcher on the planet Mosin, there to research universal legends among civilized worlds.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.000
Manly shares this interest too.

21:03.240 --> 21:08.900
Manly and Sheryl slowly fall in love and the second volume, Flexing the Warp, they marry in an elaborate ceremony.

21:09.380 --> 21:14.340
A good bit of Flexing the Warp deals with Sheryl's pregnancy. This is certainly a novelty in a science fiction work.

21:14.780 --> 21:19.000
The details are so vivid and realistic that we had to ask Norwood if he had gone through a pregnancy himself.

21:19.520 --> 21:30.980
Through the pregnancy and through a miscarriage before it, so that I took all that and you write what you know and so I put that in there because those were very important times of my life when they happened.

21:31.680 --> 21:38.860
I was there when my daughter was born in the delivery room and that's why we got to have the big group scene when Serena is born.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.640
Everybody ought to get to share this experience because it was really a lot of fun.

21:43.640 --> 21:52.980
And again one of those gratifying things is to have a fan come up and say, gee I really like female fans especially.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.400
You really got that down, I really understand that.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.540
Husbands come up and say, my wife was like that when she was pregnant.

22:00.340 --> 22:06.000
I mean, Gerard makes a wonderful comment in there that maybe women change species when they're pregnant.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.720
There's some biological basis for that.

22:09.380 --> 22:11.460
On our next show, more with Warren Norwood.

22:18.540 --> 22:27.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:34.340 --> 23:39.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.720
And here are your hosts.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.940
This is Bill Vernon.

23:49.200 --> 23:49.820
And Daryl Lane.

23:50.060 --> 23:55.380
Ever wonder how an author goes about writing a book, how the storyline develops, where characters come from?

23:55.700 --> 23:58.720
We had occasion to ask these questions of Science Fiction writer Warren Norwood.

23:59.620 --> 24:00.700
Character with a problem.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.640
That's how most of my stories began as a character with a problem.

24:07.700 --> 24:16.440
I write short stories that are unsayable because the characters have problems that are either so bizarre or so obscene,

24:18.480 --> 24:26.000
or something else that even though the problem gets resolved by the end of the story that no one's really interested in, that's fine because I just write them for fun.

24:26.080 --> 24:34.360
There are characters who pop into my head with this particular problem and I let them run through that section of their lives until they solve the problem and then they go back in the drawer.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.440
And I've gotten them out of my head, which is the most important thing.

24:37.760 --> 24:49.280
But I start with a character with a problem and very shortly thereafter, I say shortly, usually in terms of two to three weeks for a novel length work,

24:49.640 --> 24:52.960
I have a very good idea of how the story ends.

24:54.200 --> 25:02.400
So I have a beginning and an ending and the middle is just, it's like standing, I remember as a kid standing, the first time I went through Tennessee and standing on one of those overlooks.

25:02.400 --> 25:10.780
And looking out across to the mountains on the other side and there was nothing but fog and mist in the bottom, well that's kind of how I feel when I get ready to start a novel.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.780
I know where I am and I know where the mountain is on the other side, but what's in the middle there?

25:15.040 --> 25:18.000
I don't know except you have to go down and you have to come back up in order to get there.

25:18.800 --> 25:23.920
And then that middle resolves itself in a very vague way as I begin the story.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.520
Norwood then told us that after the story is set, the characters often develop lives of their own.

25:30.320 --> 25:38.640
And I found the more that I try to put my characters through paces in the middle to do certain things, the less cooperative they become.

25:39.040 --> 25:44.340
So what I try to do then is tap them back in the line when they start pushing the plot too far away.

25:44.620 --> 25:47.400
I think I'll never get to the end this way if you guys keep going left.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.380
Edge a little right and make me happy.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.960
So I nudge them back to the right a little bit and then they head back there and then they go way off too far to the right and then you have to nudge them back to the left.

25:56.740 --> 25:57.840
It's a strange process.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.140
Especially when they come alive in the back of your head and they start saying things and doing things that you didn't expect them to do.

26:04.580 --> 26:09.940
An example of this process can be seen in Sherrill, the lead female character in Norwood's Windhover tape series.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.920
Sherrill's pregnancy is a perfect example of that.

26:13.620 --> 26:19.020
I mean she wasn't supposed to get pregnant for another six months in the story because I had to get them where they were going first, right?

26:19.400 --> 26:21.660
I was going to have her get pregnant someplace safe.

26:22.220 --> 26:27.180
Oh no, she had to get pregnant and she and Jorart had to argue about it and then I was angry at both of them

26:27.180 --> 26:30.440
and then I had to back off and take five pages out of the manuscript and say, wait a minute.

26:30.980 --> 26:35.460
Take them back to the beginning of that scene and say, it's your problem. You work it out. I'll write it down.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.720
You just tell me what's right now.

26:36.940 --> 26:40.540
And so I let them argue about the problem and solve their difficulties and it was all fine.

26:41.140 --> 26:46.960
And I learned a valuable lesson. Keep your cotton picking hands off their lives when they're doing it themselves.

26:47.980 --> 26:51.920
Norwood recently published a novel with Ralph Mileyus called The Sarencynicals.

26:52.160 --> 26:56.000
The independence their characters achieved caused interesting problems for the co-authors.

26:56.820 --> 27:08.200
When Ralph and I did our book, one of the things that happened was we started with a male protagonist and then a minor protagonist who was female.

27:09.820 --> 27:14.660
And she came alive for me about the same time that he came alive for Ralph.

27:15.560 --> 27:22.380
And so Ralph was writing the first draft and he was putting words in her mouth and then when I was reading it and getting ready to write the second draft,

27:22.380 --> 27:26.700
she was in the back of my head screaming, no, no, no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't react like that.

27:27.040 --> 27:31.400
So I'd get on the phone to Ralph and I'd say, Calissa says that she wouldn't react like this.

27:31.940 --> 27:39.180
And he said, well, we'll work it out tomorrow at our story conference and we'd sit there for eight hours trying to hash out dialogue between a character who was alive in his head

27:39.180 --> 27:50.660
and a character who was alive in my head. And he had to have enough sense of that to go back then and write first draft material based on what I had told him about a character who was living in my head.

27:50.660 --> 27:57.740
The only thing that saved us was that some character didn't come alive that way for both of us, right, who then would have been schizophrenic.

27:58.420 --> 28:04.460
He'd have been alive one way and Ralph's head and another way in my head and we probably had to do something. We'd have to divide him into two characters.

28:11.100 --> 28:20.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.460
