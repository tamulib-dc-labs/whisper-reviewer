Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.220 --> 00:34.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.160
And here are your hosts.

00:43.360 --> 00:51.360
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Ray Bradbury is a name familiar not to just
readers of science fiction or fantasy, but to almost any literate American or

00:51.360 --> 01:00.260
European. Some of Bradbury's work, like the Martian Chronicles or Fahrenheit
451, are classics that are admired by readers of all kinds and of all tastes. He

01:00.260 --> 01:08.540
does indeed write science fiction and fantasy and horror and weird stories, but
they're all done with a style and emotional texture that is unique to Bradbury.

01:09.180 --> 01:14.780
Bradbury wrote from a very early age, as far back as his grammar school days in 
the Midwest. But it wasn't

01:14.780 --> 01:21.980
until he was 19 and living in Los Angeles that he got the push that helped him
to get published. He tells us about a group of science fiction writers in Los

01:21.980 --> 01:32.820
Angeles that gave him that push. Bruce Yerke, who was the secretary for the
Science Fantasy Society, wrote me a letter in October of 1937. That was my last

01:32.820 --> 01:44.580
year in high school. He invited me to come down to Clifton's Cafeteria and meet
the group. And I was very shy and a little fearful. I didn't know anyone. But

01:44.580 --> 01:56.640
nevertheless, I got my courage together and went down to a meeting. And that was
my first encounter with Forrest Ackerman, who became my first editor. He was

01:56.640 --> 02:07.220
editing a magazine called Imagination. And then along over the next year or so,
I met Henry Kuttner, Arthur Barnes, Leigh Brackett, Robert Heinlein, Jack

02:07.220 --> 02:21.000
Williamson, Ross Rocklynne, Henry Hasse. They all became friends and in one way
or another influenced me. We were very close. And I was beginning to write a lot

02:21.000 --> 02:30.920
of very bad science fiction, very bad fantasy. I still haven't learned to write
well. But these people were very patient with me. And especially I remember

02:30.920 --> 02:44.400
Robert Heinlein and his wonderful wife who invited me up to their home on
occasion. I got to read a lot of his manuscripts before they were published. He

02:44.400 --> 03:00.020
was just starting to write. He came to a meeting at the Science Fantasy Club in,
I believe it was 19, early 38 or 39. He had just written his first story and

03:00.020 --> 03:09.400
sold it to Astounding Science Fiction. So he was a beginner, just as I was,
except he was about 11 years older. He was around, I would say, 31, and I think

03:09.400 --> 03:21.280
I was 19 when I met him. So it was that kind of situation where you had personal
contact with writers who were already established or were establishing

03:21.280 --> 03:33.460
themselves. And of course it changed my life forever because I had acceptance.
People were willing to put up with me and read my terrible stories. Though

03:33.460 --> 03:40.520
Bradbury did get encouragement from these other writers, his fiction has always
been uniquely his own. We asked him if it would be fair to call him a self

03:40.520 --> 03:52.720
-taught writer. Well, I guess you can say that. Most writing, almost every art
form is self-teaching. Except what you need around the edges is shortcuts. If

03:52.720 --> 04:04.760
people can help you by recommending certain books, either books on writing or
books which give you examples of excellent writing. I remember Henry Kuttner was

04:04.760 --> 04:13.840
always calling Leigh Brackett up or calling me up and saying, Hey, have you read
Katherine Anne Porter? Do you know the work of John Collier? What about Eudora

04:13.840 --> 04:25.920
Welty? Well, this kind of shortcut is so important that you break away from your
own field and move on out into the wide culture and bring back into the science

04:25.920 --> 04:40.680
fiction and the fantasy field influences from people like Kipling or Somerset
Maugham or John Collier. So that's where having a good teacher is important. Not

04:40.680 --> 04:54.760
that they teach you all that much or that intensely, but the fact that they care
about you at all is very good for your sense of malnutrition. We all feel as if

04:54.760 --> 05:02.380
we haven't fed ourselves well enough when we're that age. We'll continue our
conversation with Ray Bradbury next time.

05:10.100 --> 05:18.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:18.280 --> 05:19.060
Odessa, Texas.

05:59.380 --> 06:03.480
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:19.900 --> 06:25.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.640
And here are your hosts.

06:33.980 --> 06:41.460
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Ray Bradbury is an internationally known
author who's managed to attract readers outside the field of science fiction and

06:41.460 --> 06:48.680
fantasy. In fact, he's one of the few writers of science fiction and fantasy
whose name is almost instantly recognizable outside the field. He's also written

06:48.680 --> 06:56.840
so-called mainstream, or regular fiction, ever since he began publishing early
in the 1940s. Dandelion Wine, a poetic novel about a boy growing up in a small

06:56.840 --> 07:03.940
Midwestern town, is one example of his non-science fiction output. We asked him
how he broke out of the restricted field of science fiction and gained such

07:03.940 --> 07:14.760
widespread acceptance, for all of his fiction, with all types of readers. Well,
you just automatically think about it for a lifetime. I always dreamt of being,

07:14.940 --> 07:25.900
number one, a writer, not a writer of science fiction or a writer of fantasy,
but a writer, period. I had huge heroes that I looked up to in the world, people

07:25.900 --> 07:36.440
like Shakespeare and a lot of the great poets, Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost
when I was in my teens. And then as I got older and began to see the world of

07:36.440 --> 07:46.400
the theater around me more, I wanted to do theater work. I loved motion
pictures. I knew that eventually I wanted to do some films. So my interests were

07:46.400 --> 07:56.420
always very Catholic, very broad, and it was only a matter of time before I
would experiment with each of these things. And at the same time I was writing

07:56.420 --> 08:07.320
and having my first success of selling stories to Weird Tales, I was beginning
to write short stories in the larger field, stories about racial relationships

08:07.320 --> 08:17.940
or stories about travel inside America. A little bit of everything I was
experimenting with. Bradbury said he was about 25 when he first began publishing

08:17.940 --> 08:28.220
stories that were not science fiction or fantasy. A friend of mine called me on
the phone and said he was going to Mexico to travel for two months. Did I want

08:28.220 --> 08:40.020
to come along? Well, I said, I can't. I don't have any money. I was still only
making around $20 a week selling stories to Weird Tales. I usually sold six

08:40.020 --> 08:49.600
stories to Weird Tales every year, which gave me around $120 for the whole year.
And then I sold an occasional murder mystery and a few science fiction stories.

08:49.700 --> 09:01.800
So my income at the time was around $2,500 a year if I was lucky. And he said,
oh, you're such a coward. He said, here, the war is over. The war has been over

09:01.800 --> 09:11.920
in Europe a month or so. You should travel and you're afraid to send out your
short stories. You're afraid of being rejected. I know you've got a lot of

09:11.920 --> 09:24.420
excellent, broad, literary, middle-stream fictions. Why don't you retype them
and send them out? So by God, he egged me on and I got three short stories out

09:24.420 --> 09:35.580
of my files. I retyped them, put an assumed name on each one, William Elliott. I
mailed them off without an agent, without any representation, with not even a

09:35.580 --> 09:46.520
letter from myself to the editors. And one story to Charm, one story to
Mademoiselle, and another one to Collier's. Bradbury got a big surprise and a

09:46.520 --> 09:58.200
big paycheck after sending those three stories in. Well, all three stories sold
within three days of each other. One story sold on August 19th to Charm, on the

09:58.200 --> 10:08.480
20th, one to Mademoiselle, and on my birthday, the 22nd of August, I sold my
first short story to Collier's. So all of a sudden, I had an aggregate of $1,000

10:08.480 --> 10:22.780
which arrived in the mail. Well, $1,000 back in 1945 would be like getting $15
,000 in the mail today. I was out of my head. I couldn't believe it. So with

10:22.780 --> 10:32.320
that money, I picked up and went to Mexico with him for six weeks, where I had a
whole series of adventures that scared the hell out of me and caused me to write

10:32.320 --> 10:41.920
some of my best weird stories when I came home. So that's the way I made the
transition, because someone called me a coward and dared me to send my stories

10:41.920 --> 10:45.500
out. On our next show, we'll have more with Ray Bradbury.

10:51.740 --> 11:00.640
Ray Bradbury This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa

11:00.640 --> 11:31.920
College in Odessa, Texas.

11:44.580 --> 11:48.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.640 --> 12:10.100
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.540
And here are your hosts.

12:18.860 --> 12:26.640
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is
one of the best-known science fiction books produced in this country. Its poetic

12:26.640 --> 12:33.660
style, its treatment of mankind's present problems, and its vision of man's
future make it a book admired not only by regular readers of science fiction,

12:33.680 --> 12:41.540
but by anyone who reads it all. The book is really a collection of related short
stories concerning man's colonization of Mars. We asked Bradbury if he wrote

12:41.540 --> 12:50.860
each story with the entire volume in mind. No, I didn't know what I was doing.
That's the best way to do things. Just do them, and then wake up some morning

12:50.860 --> 13:02.740
and discover you've got a book. I went to New York City in June of 1949. My wife
was pregnant with our first child. We had about $80 in the bank, and I took the

13:02.740 --> 13:13.480
Greyhound bus to New York, and I took all my short stories with me. Oh, 80 or 90
or 100 short stories, hoping to sell one or two collections of stories to some

13:13.480 --> 13:22.940
publisher. Well, I had meetings with various people at Simon & Schuster and
Doubleday, and they all said, look, we don't publish short stories. Nobody buys

13:22.940 --> 13:33.820
them. Nobody cares. And then one night I had dinner with Walter Bradbury at
Doubleday, no relation to me. Oh, wonderful gentleman, very bright gentleman.

13:34.560 --> 13:42.560
And sitting there at dinner that night, he said, Ray, what about all those
Martian stories? Isn't there a novel there? Isn't there some way of hanging them

13:42.560 --> 13:52.680
all together? It seems to me there's a common thread. I said, oh, my God. But,
you know, years ago I made notes about doing a series of chronicles and then

13:52.680 --> 14:01.720
threw the notes somewhere and forgot about them. So my subconscious must have
remembered, and along through the years was putting these beads on a single

14:01.720 --> 14:13.340
thread. I went back to the YMCA that night, sat in my underwear. It was a hot,
hot summer evening, terribly humid, and finished typing out an outline of a

14:13.340 --> 14:22.540
book, which I called The Martian Chronicles, which I then took to Doubleday the
next day, and they promptly bought the novel, plus The Illustrated Man, a

14:22.540 --> 14:35.020
collection of stories. And I left New York City with, again, a fabulous $1,000,
$500 for each book. The stories are not scientifically accurate. Man can breathe

14:35.020 --> 14:42.300
the Martian atmosphere unaided, for example, but they're not meant to be. They
have to be read symbolically, at a deep unconscious level, which is triggered by

14:42.300 --> 14:49.980
Bradbury's poetic way of writing. There is an order to the 26 stories that make
up The Martian Chronicles. The final one is entitled The Million Year Picnic,

14:50.060 --> 15:02.560
and we asked Bradbury why he put that one last. It seemed a proper place to put
it. It seemed a culmination of all the stories, and my job in looking at all my

15:02.560 --> 15:12.020
stories was to guess where to place each, and, well, some of them it was very
easy. I did a whole series of stories of first encounters on Mars with various

15:12.020 --> 15:23.540
expeditions, so I knew those automatically had to be up front, along with an
imaginary encounter in Illa, where a woman dreams an invasion of Mars. And we

15:23.540 --> 15:32.060
never see the invasion itself of the Earth men, but we know that secretly it
must be there somewhere, and that real people got killed by the jealous husband.

15:32.060 --> 15:44.040
And then you go along through all the other encounters and what happens to Mars
as a result of the invasion by Earth people, and ending with all of your final

15:44.040 --> 15:56.060
beats and a brief return to Earth for There Will Come Soft Rains, and then the
Million Year Picnic at the end. It all fell together in roughly two hours in my

15:56.060 --> 16:06.360
head at the typewriter that night at the YMCA. In 1980, NBC produced a major six
-hour dramatization of the Martian Chronicles. We asked Bradbury if he was happy

16:06.360 --> 16:19.260
with it. I most certainly was not. It was one of the most boring shows ever put
on television, and it's a great shame. Obviously no one enjoyed doing it, and

16:19.260 --> 16:27.860
the director obviously didn't enjoy it, which is a great shame, because he
should have got out of bed every morning and said, let's have a ball, let's

16:27.860 --> 16:37.520
play, let's jump up and down and scream and yell and get something out of this
material. But he obviously didn't do that. We'll have more with Ray Bradbury on

16:37.520 --> 16:38.100
our next show.

16:45.500 --> 16:53.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:53.520 --> 16:54.280
Odessa, Texas.

17:36.820 --> 17:40.880
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:56.940 --> 18:02.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:05.140 --> 18:06.880
And here are your hosts.

18:11.080 --> 18:20.040
This is Daryl Ane and David Carson. Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel, Something Wicked
This Way Comes, is a classic of fantasy and horror. It's about a carnival that

18:20.040 --> 18:28.460
comes to a small Midwestern town, a carnival with evil secrets beneath its
colorful exterior, and about two boys who discover the evil. We asked Bradbury

18:28.460 --> 18:37.260
if there was a particular impetus behind the story. Not really. It all started a
long time ago. I wrote a short story for Weird Tales called "The Black Ferris".

18:38.360 --> 18:49.680
And I've always been in love with carnivals and circuses and illustrated men and
dwarves and pygmies and you name it. So over the years, all this material

18:49.680 --> 19:00.980
accumulated. And one night about 24 years ago, Gene Kelly invited me over to MGM
Studios here to see a new film of his called Invitation to the Dance. And part

19:00.980 --> 19:14.960
of that film is a sort of dance ballet concerned with a clown, a carnival, the
sort of material that Lon Chaney Sr. once did 60 years ago in American films. He

19:14.960 --> 19:21.280
did a lot of films about circuses and armless,

19:21.440 --> 19:34.280
legless performers, all kinds of grotesques that he worked with and pretended to
imitate. So I came out of the screening of Gene Kelly's film and walked home

19:34.280 --> 19:44.120
with my wife, lamenting all the way the fact that I'd never worked for Kelly and
wanting very much to do so. So I got home and I rummaged through all my material

19:44.120 --> 19:57.600
to find something to send to Gene Kelly. And I found "The Black Ferris" and I took
several weeks to write it into a longer 70-page screen adaptation treatment

19:57.600 --> 20:07.880
outline. And I took it to Kelly and he immediately said, My God, I must direct
this. Can I have an option on it? I'll take it to Europe and try to get some

20:07.880 --> 20:17.020
money. He went to Europe for a number of weeks and months and finally returned
and said, It's no use. Nobody wants to put up any money for this. Thanks very

20:17.020 --> 20:28.380
much and so long. Well, I was heartbroken because I wanted to work for Kelly and
I said to heck with it. I sat down and I wrote the long screen treatment into a

20:28.380 --> 20:40.380
novel. It took me about two years. And the novel was published in the late
summer of 1962, 20 years ago. The novel is a good example of Bradbury's

20:40.380 --> 20:48.320
beautifully poetic style. It uses images of autumn and the gaudy colors of a
carnival to convey hidden menace and evil. The carnival rides, for instance, do

20:48.320 --> 20:56.760
strange things to people. And the sideshow freaks and grotesques have unnatural
horrifying powers. Bradbury often uses carnival material as a symbol of evil. We

20:56.760 --> 21:07.060
asked him why. I think most of us are uncomfortable around carnivals and
circuses. We sense that the people who run them are evil people. There is

21:07.060 --> 21:20.680
something wrong with most carnival people. The workers, it's a very tough life.
It's a rough existence. And it's run by a bunch of tramps and vagabonds and

21:20.680 --> 21:32.800
people who go from town to town. They have no roots. And I should imagine
there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes we can't even guess at. Not that

21:32.800 --> 21:40.920
there isn't a hierarchy there. In a big circus, of course, there is. And the
people at the top of the hierarchy are the trapeze people. They are the royal

21:40.920 --> 21:52.660
family. And then you go downwards through the various levels of performers,
depending on their athletic prowess. But it's a very difficult life. And it's a

21:52.660 --> 22:01.900
miracle if most of these people make it through and keep their sanity. So when
you're a child, you sense, especially in the seedy little carnivals that come to

22:01.900 --> 22:20.780
visit your hometown, you sense the uneasiness, the sly life, the sense of evil
behind the scenes in these people. I suppose that's where my fictions came from.

22:21.540 --> 22:28.460
Something Wicked This Way Comes is being made into a major motion picture by
Disney Studios and should be out at the end of the year. We'll continue next

22:28.460 --> 22:30.040
time with the works of Ray Bradbury.

22:37.740 --> 22:45.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:45.820 --> 22:46.580
Odessa, Texas.

23:29.260 --> 23:33.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:49.240 --> 23:54.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.140
And here are your hosts.

24:03.500 --> 24:12.180
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. One of Ray Bradbury's classic novels is
Fahrenheit 451. It's a chilling picture of a future society in which books are

24:12.180 --> 24:19.980
outlawed and humans are weakened by addiction to a totally electronic society. A
person who possesses a book is subject to severe punishment, and there's even a

24:19.980 --> 24:27.520
government institution composed of firemen whose job it is to seek out all books
and burn them. We asked Bradbury if there was a particular episode or

24:27.520 --> 24:40.760
inspiration behind Fahrenheit 451. It was a combination of things. I'd gotten
interested with book burners over a period of time, and when I wrote the book

24:40.760 --> 24:51.560
was the beginning of a McCarthy era, the Joseph McCarthy period, when there was
a lot of talk about books being banned. Not many of them got banned, thank God.

24:51.560 --> 25:02.740
But for a brief moment there, I think they took a few American books off of
foreign library shelves in army libraries. And then President Eisenhower ordered

25:02.740 --> 25:17.680
them all put back on, which proved what a bright man he was, thank goodness. But
it was during that period that I suppose my subconscious fermented on all this

25:17.680 --> 25:30.540
and said I've got to do a book about my anger about libraries, because libraries
is really the place where I was born and raised myself, grew up, and have lived

25:30.540 --> 25:42.720
for a lifetime. They really are very super special to me. And I go in bookstores
constantly. I can't stay away from them. I buy too many books. I'm compulsive

25:42.720 --> 25:58.280
about it. So the novel wrote itself in nine days. I went up to UCLA in 19...
This was back in 1950. And I spent nine days there in the typing room in the

25:58.280 --> 26:09.040
basement of the UCLA library with about 12 students sitting around me. And I
played these dime-a-half-hour typewriter machines. And I typed the novel on

26:09.040 --> 26:19.720
those dime machines. And I spent around $9.40 typing the novel. So it's a grand
place to write a book like that, isn't it, in the basement of a library.

26:20.820 --> 26:28.440
Bradbury seems to be pointing out the dangers of a technological society in the
novel. And some of his other work, like The Martian Chronicles, has some of the

26:28.440 --> 26:39.600
same warnings. We asked him if his work is anti-technological. Well, that's a
misinterpretation. It's never been true. I've never mistrusted technologies.

26:39.600 --> 26:48.680
Only people. There's a big difference there. It's the way we use the automobile,
for instance. There's nothing wrong with cars that having more safe drivers

26:48.680 --> 27:04.220
won't change. Now, when it comes to computers, space travel, IBM's electric
typewriters, these are all beautiful. We're using them well. And the future is

27:04.220 --> 27:14.760
very exciting because of it. Now, I've tried to pick those technologies that I
criticized. For instance, there was a certain moment in history in Los Angeles

27:14.760 --> 27:25.800
where they were threatening to put Muzak with advertising on our buses. And I
immediately mounted a campaign with some friends, thousands of people, who said,

27:25.900 --> 27:34.100
Oh, no, you don't. It's bad enough we have all these posters all over the place.
But to trap us on buses and then make us listen to music we don't want to hear

27:34.100 --> 27:47.360
or advertisements we don't want to hear. So I'm anti the way that particular
technology was going to be used. We asked Bradbury if he thought there was any

27:47.360 --> 27:57.700
danger of book burning or censorship today. We hear those rumors every year. And
there are always some stupid librarians or some stupid mayor or some dumb

27:57.700 --> 28:07.680
pressure group in some town somewhere in our country every year for the last 60
years. If it wants to censor this or censor that. And then they blow away.

28:07.820 --> 28:16.220
They're just chaffing the wind. And don't pay any attention to them. And if they
grow a giant size, call me on the phone. I'll come over and kick them in the

28:16.220 --> 28:17.320
kishkas. Okay?

28:25.380 --> 28:33.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:33.500 --> 28:41.120
Odessa, Texas.
