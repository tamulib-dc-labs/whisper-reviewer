This would be the cover of the minstrel bass solo, Asleep in the Deep, sung by George Bushong, especially for Bill Aaron Owens.

Loudly the bell in the old tower rings,
Bidding us listen to the warning it brings, 
Sailor take care, Sailor take care, 
Danger is near,
Oh, beware, beware, beware, beware, 
Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep,
Oh, beware, beware,
Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep, 
Oh, beware, beware.
