There's a wonderful invention. 
It is called the radio.
You can hear it almost every place you go.
But the static in the air 
Makes it sometimes hard to hear.
But it is not so with heaven's radio.

Heaven's radio on the other shore, 
Where my precious Savior listens in.
There's no static in the air 
And it never needs repair 
Cause my precious Savior listens in.

When your burdens bring you down 
Almost level with the ground, 
Broadcast unto Jesus, he's listening in.
He will give you courage new 
And will lead you safely through, 
Cause my precious Savior listens in.
