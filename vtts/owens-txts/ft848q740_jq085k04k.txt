The Old Chisholm Trail, sung by Brownie McNeill, Austin, Texas, October 21st, 1939.

Now come along, boys, and listen to my tale.
I'll tell you my troubles on the Old Chisholm Trail.
Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay. Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay.

With a ten dollar mule and a fifty dollar saddle, 
I'm a-going out west to punch Texas cattle.
Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay. Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay.

I started up the trail October 23rd, with a

Great Grandad.

Great grandad, when the land was young, 
Bored his door with a wagon tongue, 
For the times were rough and the redskins knocked, 
And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked.

He was a citizen tough and grim, 
Danger was duck soup to him, 
He ate corn pone and bacon fat, 
But great grandson would starve on that.

Twenty-one children came to bless 
The old man's home in the wilderness.
Doubt this statement if you can, 
But great grandad was a busy man.

Twenty-one sons and not one bad.
...Great grandad, 
For if they had, he'd have been right glad 
Just to tan their hides with a hickory head.

Twenty-one sons and how they clung 
And tall on the bacon too.
Slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats 
And they hunted in the woods for their coonskin caps.

He raised them rough but he raised them well 
When their feet took hold on the road to hell.
He filled them full of the fear of God 
And he straightened them out with his old ramrod.

They grew strong in heart and hand, 
Firm foundation of our land.
Twenty-one sons now his grandson 
Is having a terrible time with one.
