The Orphan Girl.

“No home, no home,” pled a little girl, 
At the door of a princely hall, 
As she trembling stood on the polished shelf 
And leaned on the marble wall. 

“My father, alas, I never knew.”
And a tear dimmed her eye so bright.
“My mother sleeps in a new-made grave.
Tis an orphan begs tonight.”

Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare.
But the snow had covered her head.
“Oh, give me a home,” she feebly said.
“A home and a bit of bread.” 

The night was dark and the snow fell fast, 
But the rich man closed his door, 
And his proud face frowned as he scornfully said, 
“No room, no bread for the poor.”

The morning dawned and the orphan girl 
Still lay at the rich man's door,
But her soul had fled to a home above 
Where there's room and bread for the poor.
