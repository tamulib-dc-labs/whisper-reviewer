Utah Carroll by Daniel Jeffus. Lovelady.

You ask me, little friend, why I'm silent, sad, and still,
Why my brow is always cloudy like the darkness on the hill.
Pull in your pony closer and I'll tell a simple tale 
Of my partner Utah Carroll and his last ride on the trail.

In the cactus and the thistles in the Mexican foreign land, 
Where the cattle roam in thousands without either mark or brand, 
There's a grave without a headstone, without either date or name, 
There is where my partner's sleeping, it's the place from which I came.

We were rounding up one morning when our work was almost done, 
To the right the cattle started in a wild and maddened run; 
But the boss's little daughter who was holding on that side 
Started in to turn the cattle. That is where my partner died.

There was nothing on the ranges that would cause the cattle to fight 
Half so much as a red blanket that they waved before their sight
Little Lenore she saw her danger and she turned upon his face 
Then leaning from the saddle she tried her blanket to replace 

But in leaning from the saddle fell in the front of that wild tide
“Lie there, I am a-coming,” was the word my partner cried.
Every boy on the cow range, they all held their breath.
For they knew that fate was trying, it was fate of life or death.

About fifty yards behind her, Utah Carroll came riding fast.
Little did he think that moment that the ride would be his last.
He swept fast past her, but he caught her in his arms, 
And the back cinch fell beneath him, and he fell beside Lenore.

But the weight up on the saddle like had never been before,
And the back cinch broke beneath him, and he fell beside Lenore.
