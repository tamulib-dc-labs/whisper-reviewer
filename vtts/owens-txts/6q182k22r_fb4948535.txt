It may be the best for me,
It may be the best for me,
My Lord knows the way,
And I’ll obey
Cause it may be the best for me.

I often wonder why it is
That some are so happy and free,
While my head’s bowed and my soul oppressed,
Yet it may be the best for me.

It may be the best for me,
It may be the best for me,
My Lord knows the way,
And I’ll obey
Cause it may be the best for me.

There are some who have parents
There at home
While mine are gone and I’m left all alone
But I’ll trust my lord till the judgement morn
Cause it may be the best for me.
