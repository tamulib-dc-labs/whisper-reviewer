Pilgrim.

I am a poor pilgrim
A stranger traveling through this unfriendly world,
I’ve heard of a city called Heaven,
I’m trying to make it in.

Sometimes I’m both tossed and driven,
Sometimes I knew not where to roam
I’ve heard of a city called Heaven,
I’m trying to make it in.

My mother is gone on and left me,
My father’s still walking in sin,
My brother, my sister, gone back on me
Just because I’m trying to make it in.

Sometimes I’m both tossed and driven,
Sometimes I knew not where to roam
I’ve heard of a city called Heaven,
I’m trying to make it in.
