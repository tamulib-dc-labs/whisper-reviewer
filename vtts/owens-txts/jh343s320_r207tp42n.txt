Cowboy Jack.

Jack was just a lonely cowboy with a heart so brave and true.
He learned to love a maiden with eyes of heaven's blue.

They learned to love each other. They named their wedding day.
When a quarrel came between them, and Jack he rode away. 

He joined a band of cowboys, he tried to forget her name.
Out on the lonely prairie, she waits for him the same.

When Jack began his singing, his mind wandered back.
He was singing of a maiden who is waiting for her Jack.

Your sweetheart waits for you Jack. Your sweetheart waits for you. 
Out on the lonely prairie where the skies are always blue.
