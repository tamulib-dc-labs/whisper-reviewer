My father died when I was young, seventeen years ago,
My mother stayed and worked harderâ€¦

I have always been stubborn and wanted to have my way, 
I've not been crooked in my life. This is what I have to say. 

My mother is a lady and never done no wrong.
That's why I'm lonely, sad and blue. I love to sing this song.

I take my guitar with me no matter where I go. 
And when I feel so blue so bad, I sing my song so sad.

I hear that train a-coming. I'll be on my way...
