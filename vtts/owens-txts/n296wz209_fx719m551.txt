Oh, Lord of Zion, 
Oh, God in heaven, oh,
Keep a-singing, boys.
That's what's the matter with the church today.

Ask that liar, morning fame,
Ask that liar, jump and flame,
Ask that liar, the reason why.
He says, “The people in the church are lying as well as I.”

Oh, Lord of Zion, 
Oh, God in heaven, oh,
Keep a-singing, boys.
That's what's the matter with the church today.

Ask that gambler, morning fame, 
Ask that gambler, jump and flame,
Ask that gambler, the reason why,
He says, “The people in the church are gambling as well as I.”

Oh, Lord of Zion, 
Oh, God in heaven, oh,
Keep a-singing, boys.
That's what's the matter with the church today.

Ask that drunk, morning fame, 
Ask that drunk, jump and flame, 
As that drunk, the reason why,
He says, “The people in the church drink as well as I.”

Oh, Lord of Zion, 
Oh, God in heaven, oh,
Keep a-singing, boys.
That's what's the matter with the church.
