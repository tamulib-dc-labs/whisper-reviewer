Flirtation, Mrs. Irvin Thompson.

They stood on the shore at evening
Beneath the twilight fair.
A youth in the prime of his manhood,
A girl with golden hair.

“I never thought that you loved me.
Never thought that you even cared.”
And her head drooped sadly 
Under a cloud of golden hair.

“I never thought that you loved me.
Never thought that you even cared.”
And her head drooped sadly 
Under a cloud of golden hair.

As she leaned from a carriage window.
Her beautiful haunting face.
A cold and elegant woman.
All dressed in silk and lace.

Why, she goes where the people 
Always bitter or cold.
A heart to soon grow weary.
A man can soon grow old.

“I never thought that you loved me.
“Au revoir.” She gave him a hand.
And gathering her robes all around her.
She left him alone on the sand.
