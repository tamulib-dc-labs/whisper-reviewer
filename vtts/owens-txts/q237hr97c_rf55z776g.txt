Through the years I keep on toiling,
Toiling through sun and rain,
Watching and patiently waiting,
Till the Savior comes again.

I am waiting, oh Lord, now,
And trusting in thy way, oh, have mercy now,
Keep me from the path of sin, oh Lord, now,
Hide me in your love, oh, Lord now,
Write my name above, oh, Lord now,
When the gates swing open, oh, Lord now,
I'll walk in, I'll walk in.

Lord, teach me how to love my neighbor,
Teach me how to treat my friends,
Fill me with the Holy Spirit,
Just keep me humble to the end.

I am waiting, oh Lord, now,
And trusting in thy way, oh, have mercy now,
Keep me from the path of sin, oh Lord, now,
Hide me in your love, oh, Lord now,
Write my name above, oh, Lord now,
When the gates swing open, oh, Lord now,
I'll walk in, I'll walk in.

Well, I'm tired of the load I carry,
Tired of the weight of sin,
Angels in heaven keep beckoning,
Saying “Weary soul, come in.”

I am coming, oh Lord, now,
And trusting in thy way, oh, have mercy now,
Keep me from the path of sin, oh Lord, now,
Hide me in your love, oh, Lord now,
Write my name above, oh, Lord now,
When the gates swing open, oh, Lord now,
I'll walk in, I'll walk in.
