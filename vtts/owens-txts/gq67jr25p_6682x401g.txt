The Trail to Mexico, sung by Brownie McNeill, Austin, Texas, October 21st, 1939.

I made up my mind in an early day 
That I'd leave my gal, she was too gay. 
That I'd leave my home and roam for a while, 
And travel out west for many a mile. 

Twas in the year of ‘83, 
That old man Spell, he said to me. 
He says, “Young fellow, I want you to go 
And follow my herd down to Mexico.”

It was in the merry month of May,
We rounded up and we went away.
I'm telling you boys, it was a lonesome go 
Along the trail down to Mexico.

When I arrived in Mexico 
I wanted to see my love but I couldn't go. 
I wrote a letter to my dear 
But never a word from her could I hear.

When I got back to my once loved home, 
I called for the darling of my own.
They said “She had married a richer life.
Therefore, wild cowboy, you may seek another wife.”

Oh, the girl she's married I do adore.
And I cannot stay at home anymore. 
I'll make my way to the Rio Grande 
All the way out west with my cowboy band.
