Same as before, now sing, Leakin' in the building.

Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
I believe I’ll have to move, I’ll find a better home.

My mother found Jesus in this old building.
My mother found Jesus in this old building.
My mother found Jesus in this old building.
And then she had to move, she found a better home.

Leaking in, leaking in, leaking in my building.
Leaking in, leaking in, leaking in my building.
Leaking in, leaking in, leaking in my building.
Leaking in, leaking in, leaking in my building.

Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in this old building.
I believe I’ll have to move, I’ll find a better home.
