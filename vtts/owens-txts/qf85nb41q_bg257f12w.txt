Joe Bowers.

My name it is Joe Bowers.
I have a brother Ike.
I came from old Missouri.
Yes, all the way from Pike.
I used to court a pretty girl 
By the name of Sally Black.
I asked her to marry me.
She said it was a whack.

But says she to me, “Joe Bowers, 
Before we hitch for life, 
You'd better get a little house 
To keep your little wife.”

I says, “Sally, oh Sally, 
It's all for your sake.
I'll go down to California 
And try to raise a stake.”

At length I went to mining, 
Put in my biggest licks.
Fell down upon the shining, 
Just like a thousand bricks.
I worked both late and early, 
In rainstorm and snow.
It was all for my dear Sally's sake, 
Oh yes, the same to Joe.

At length there came a letter, 
It was from my brother Ike.
It came from old Missouri, 
Yes, all the way from Pike.

It had some of the goldarnedest news 
A fellow ever heard.
That Sally had married a butcher 
And the butcher had red beard.

There was something more in this letter 
That would make a fellow swear.
That Sally's got a baby 
And the baby's got red hair.
