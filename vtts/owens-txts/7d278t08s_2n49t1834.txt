My shepherd's gone and left me. 

I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I wonder where can my shepherd be, be, be.

I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I hear my shepherd calling way out on the mountains,
I wonder where can my shepherd be, be, be.

My shepherd's gone and left me way out on the mountain,
My shepherd's gone and left me way out on the mountain,
My shepherd's gone and left me way out on the mountain,
I wonder where can my shepherd be, be, be.
