The Spanish Fandilio.

I am the Spanish Fandilio.
I live in my great big Castileo.
I'm proud of my tra-la-la-lilio, 
And the works of my tweetle-dum-dee.

One night I went to the abridio, 
And there I met a young senorito.
I showed her my tra-la-la-lilio, 
And the works of my tweetle-dum-dee.

I took her back to my castileo.
I laid her upon the sofileo.
...my tra-la-la-lilio, 
And the works of my tweetle-dum-dee.

Next day I went to the doctrilio.
I showed him a tra-la-la-lilio.
He says, you have got the syphilio, 
For the works of your tweetle-dum-dee.

Now I sit in my famous Castileo, 
With a roll of cotton bandillio, 
A swab on my tra-la-la-lilio, 
By the works of my tweetle-dum-dee.
