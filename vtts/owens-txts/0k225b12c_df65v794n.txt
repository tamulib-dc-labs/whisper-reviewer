Oh Mona, itâ€™s a song.

As the old preacher was sitting on the log, oh Mona.
Hand on the trigger and eye on the hog, oh Mona.
The gun said boom and the hog said vip, oh Mona.
The preacher grabbed him with all his grip, oh Mona.

Oh Mona, you shall be free.
Oh Mona, you shall be free.
When the good Lord sets you free.

Come around the chicken house on my knees, oh Mona.
The preacher grabbed him with all his grip, oh Mona.
The hog said vip and the gun went boom, oh Mona.
The preacher grabbed him with all his grip, oh Mona.

Oh Mona, you shall be free.
When the good Lord sets you free.

Come around the chicken house on my knees, oh Mona.
Thought I heard a chicken sneeze, oh Mona.
He sneezed so hard with the whooping cough, oh Mona.
Sneezed his head and his tail right off, oh Mona.

Oh Mona, you shall be free.
When the good Lord sets you free.
