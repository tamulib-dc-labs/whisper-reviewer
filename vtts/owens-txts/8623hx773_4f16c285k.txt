Girls Mind Who You Slight by Lemuel Jeffus. Lovelady.

There was a young lady in London did dwell, 
A beautiful damsel called Sally by name. 
There was a young knight worth three thousand a year. 
To court this young lady, this young knight did steer.

“Oh Sally, pretty Sally, oh Sally,” says he, 
“I'm sorry all my love and yours don't agree, 
A ruin, a ruin, I ever shall be, 
Unless there is a liking that you take to me.”

“I never can have you, nor no other man,
As far to have you, it's more than I can.”
Her being so rich and her portion so high.
Upon this young knight she did scarce cast an eye.

Six months have happened, it's happened and passed.
She is pierced to the heart and I know not what for.
She sends for this young man that she had slighted and scorned.
He comes, he comes unto her bedside.

“Sing, madam, the pain that does trouble you 
Who line your head are your side.”
“Oh, no, kind sir, the right you've not guessed.
The pain that does trouble me, it lies in my breath.”

“Oh, Sally, pretty Sally, oh, Sally,” says he, 
“It's don't you remember when you slighted me?”
“Oh, yes, kind sir, but I hope you may forgive 
And grant me a few more years longer to live.”

“I never can forgive you, enduring my breath.
I'll dance all over your grave when you're laid under the earth.”
She pulls off a finger her diamond rings three.
“Sing, wear these for my sake when you're dancing over me.”

Oh, girls, oh, girls, mind who you slight.
You proud-hearted ladies, I bid you good night.
