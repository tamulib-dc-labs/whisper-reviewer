This is William Hall, sung by Lily Williams.

I will tell you of a brisky young farmer 
Who has lately gone to the sea.
He courted a fair handsome lady 
Who lived in Desmo town.

And when her parents came to know this, 
They were angry and did say, 
“We will send him far across the ocean, 
Where his face you will never more see.”

He roamed and he roamed the ocean over, 
Until he came to his native land.
“If Molly was alive and I could find her, 
I would make her my lawful wife.”

Early, early in the morning,
As he was walking down the street.
Cold drops of rain fell just as it happened.
For the chance of his true love for meet.

“Good morning, good morning, you pretty fair lady.
Oh, would you choose to fancy me?”
“Oh, no, I fancy a brisky farmer.
Who has lately gone to the sea.”

“Oh, describe him, oh, describe him.
Oh, describe him unto me.
Perhaps I've seen a sword go through him 
As I've lately crossed the sea.

“Oh, yes, I saw him and I knew him.
And his name is William Hall, 
And I saw that sword go through him, 
And in death I saw him fall.” 

So screamed this fair lady,
“Oh, good Lord, what shall I do?
Oh, now we have parted broken hearted.
Now, good Lord, what shall I do?”

“Cheer up, cheer up, you pretty fair lady. 
Cheer up, cheer up,” said he.
“And now to convince you of the story.
Here's the ring that you gave me.”
