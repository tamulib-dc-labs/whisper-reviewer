Oh, Cindy. 

Oh Cindy is a pretty girl,
I've known her all my life,
And if I had to marry, 
Oh Cindy would be my wife.

Get along home, Cindy, 
Get along home, Cindy, 
Get along home, Cindy, 
Way down in ... town.

I was sitting at the window
…
I thought I had my Cindy
…

Her cheeks are like a cherry, 
Her hair is like a rose.
How much I love my Cindy, 
And nobody knows.

Get along home, Cindy, 
Get along home, Cindy, 
Get along home, Cindy, 
Way down in ... town.
