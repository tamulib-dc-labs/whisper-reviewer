The Butcher's Boy, an old British ballad, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

In London City, where I did dwell, 
Lived a butcher's boy that I loved so well, 
He courted me my heart away, 
And now with me he will not stay.

There is a house in London town 
Where my true love goes and he dares sits down. 
He takes a strange girl on his knee 
And he tells to her what he won't tell me. 

“Oh mother mother I'll tell you why. 
It's because she has more gold than I.
But her gold will melt and her silver fly, 
And she will be as poor as I.”

Her father come home from a far off town, 
Saying, “Where, oh, where is my daughter gone?
Saying, where, oh, where is my pride and joy?
Oh, has she gone with the butcher's boy?”

He went upstairs, the door he broke, 
And found her hanging by a rope.
He took a knife and cut her down, 
And on her bosom, these lines he found.

“Go dig my grave, both wide and deep 
Place a marble stone at my head and feet 
And on my breast place a turtledove
To show to the world that I died for love.

Must I go bound while he goes free?
Must I love a man who don't love me?
Oh, I have played a maiden's part 
And died for the man who broke my heart.”
