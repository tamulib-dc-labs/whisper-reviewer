This is Ghost playing the blues about my black gal.

Go ahead and play it, Ghost. You know you can play it.

Woke up this morning 
Looking at the blinding sun, 
Thinking about my jet black woman, 
Wondering what had I done. 

Got the blues about my black gal. 
Yeah, she got the blues about me.
Yes, and I'm blue and I'm lonesome, darling, 
As any poor boy can be.

The brook runs in the river,
The river runs in the sea.
My black woman does quit me,
She won't write to me.
Got the blues about my black gal. 
Yeah, she got the blues about me.

And I believe I'll go back, 
Back to dear old Tennessee.
I asked my jet black woman, 
“What makes you treat me so?”
She said, “Look here, daddy, 
I don't want you no more.”

Got the blues about my black gal. 
Yeah, she got the blues about me.
Yes, and I'm blue and I'm lonesome, darling, 
As any poor boy can be.
