Lord, take my hand,
Lead me on, let me stand.
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn.
Through the storms, through the night, 
Lead me on to the light,
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on.

Lord, take my hand,
And lead me on, and let me stand.
I am so tired, I am so weak, I am worn.
Oh, through the storms, and through the night, 
And lead me right on to the light,
Take my hand, precious Lord, and lead me on.

Lord, take my hand,
And lead me on, and let me stand.
I am so tired, I am weak, I am worn.
Oh, through the storms, and through the night, 
And lead your child on to the light,
Take my hand, precious Lord, and lead me on.

When the darkness appears
And the night draws near,
And when my life is almost gone
At my river I stand,
Guide my feet, hold my hand,
Take my hand, precious Lord, and lead me on.

Precious Lord, take my hand,
And lead me on, and let me stand.
I am so tired, I am so weak, I am worn.
Oh, through the storms, and through the night, 
And lead your child on to the light,
Take my hand, precious Lord, and lead me on.
