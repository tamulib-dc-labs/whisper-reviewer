Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

One of these mornings...and fair,
Take my wings and by the hand,
Pharoah's army got drowned, 
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

I haven’t been to Heaven, but I’ve been told,
The streets in Heaven are paved with gold,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

If you get there before I do,
Tell my savior I’m coming too,
Pharoah's army got drowned, 
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.

Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Oh, Mary, don't weep, don't mourn,
Pharoah's army got drowned,
Oh, Mary, don't weep.
