Oh, there's no hiding place down here. 
Oh, there's no hiding place down here.
Oh, there's no hiding place down here.
Oh, I went to the rock to hide my face. 
The rock cried out, “No hiding place.” 
There's no hiding place down here.

Oh, the sinner man, he gambled and fell,
Oh, the sinner man, he gambled and fell,
Oh, the sinner man, he gambled, and he gambled and fell.
He wanted to go to heaven, but he’ll end up in hell.
There's no hiding place down here.

Oh, there's no hiding place down here.
Oh, there's no hiding place down here.
Oh, I went to the rock to hide my face. 
The rock cried out, “No hiding place.”
There's no hiding place down here.
