Jesus is mine, and I am forgiven. 
I'm holding His hand, I'm going to heaven.
I have found a wonderful Savior, whose freedom is only forever.
I am His, oh Lord, and He is mine.

Yes, Jesus is mine, and I am forgiven.
I'm holding His hand, I'm going to heaven.

I am His, oh Lord, and He is mine.
Oh, Lord, and He is mine.

I will follow where he leads me
...
I am His, oh Lord, and He is mine.
I am...in his power, and I'm happy every hour.
I am His, oh Lord, and He is mine.

Jesus is mine, and I am forgiven. 
I'm holding His hand, I'm going to heaven.
I have found a wonderful Savior, whose freedom is only forever.
I am His, oh Lord, and He is mine.
