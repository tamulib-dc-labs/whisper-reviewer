Popeye and the Ghost again, with the Popeye and the Ghost blues.

Play it, Ghost, now, let's go on to town.

I cried all night, mama, and all the night before;
I cried all night, mama, and all the night before;
Now I'm gonna change my way of living, I ain't gonna cry no more. 

If you love me, baby, got to change the way you do;
If you love me, baby, got to change the way you do;
As long as you ain't spending my money, I have to run around and look for you.

Oh, two in the morning, ‘tween midnight and day;
Oh, two in the morning, ‘tween midnight and day;
I always turn on the other pillow where my baby used to lay.

Oh, now look, look, mama, tell me what in the world you trying to do;
Oh, now look, look, mama, tell me what in the world you trying to do;
They way you play with other men and stay away from home, baby, I think your trying to break my poor heart in two.

All right, let's go. I know you can do it. Of course I know you can do it, please.
