The Santa Fe Trail, played by Brownie McNeill at Austin, Texas, February 18, 1939.

Say, have you sighted a schooner 
Alongside of the Santa Fe Trail?
They made it here Monday or sooner.
They had a water keg tied on the tail.
There was Daddy and Ma on the mule seat.
And somewhere along by the way was a tow-headed gal on a pinto, 
Just a janglin' for old Santa Fe.
Yo-ho, just a janglin' for old Santa Fe.

I seen her ride down the arroyo, 
Way back on the Arkansas sands.
She had a smile like an acre of sunflowers, 
And a quirt in her little brown hand.
She mounted her pinto so at ease, 
She rode like she carried the mail, 
And her eyes near set fire to the prairie, 
Alongside of the Santa Fe trail.
Yo-ho, alongside of the Santa Fe

I know a gal down on the border 
That'd ride to El Paso to sight. 
I'm acquainted with the high-flying orders 
And I sometimes kiss some gals goodnight. 
But, Lord, they're all fluffers and beaded
Drink afternoon tea by the pail.
I'm not used to that sort of stampeding 
Alongside of the Santa Fe trail. 
Yo-ho, alongside of the Santa Fe.

Now I don't know her name on the prairie 
When you're hunting one gal it's so wide. 
It's shorter from hell to Hillary
Than it is on the Santa Fe ride.
So I'll try to make Plummerâ€™s by sundown 
Where a camp can be made on the swale.
I'll come on that gal with her pinto.
She'll be camped on the Santa Fe trail.
