In the Right Church, But the Wrong Pew, That's All, by Tom Ballentine.

Now, who's that knocking at this hour to be shocking?
Get no banging on a lady's door.
Just listen, Jim Johnson, she's calling Miss Thompson, 
A fool and man pretend she don't live here no more.
Miss Thompson done boom, but that can be proved, 
Cause her trunk and little things ain't here.
I don't explain, Mrs. Thompson don't remain, 
And I'm sorry for to tell you, dear. 

You're in the right church, but in the wrong pew.
You're in the right neighborhood, that's true.
You're in the right street, once more.
You're in the right house, but on the wrong floor.
But when you're out late, just get the name straight 
Before you attempt to call.
You're in the right church but the wrong pew, that’s all. 

Last night while sleeping, I heard somebody creeping 
Because the burglar man that came to call. 
It certainly was funny, he thought I had money, 
I broke as I could be. He tried to make a hole, 
So I yelled out mister, I got a rich sister, 
She's just living on the floor below,
To whom it concerns, she's got money to burn, 
So you know just where to go.

You're in the right church, but in the wrong pew.
You're in the right neighborhood, that's true.
You're in the right street, once more.
You're in the right house, but on the wrong floor.
But when you're out late, just get the name straight 
Before you attempt to call.
You're in the right church but the wrong pew, that’s all.
