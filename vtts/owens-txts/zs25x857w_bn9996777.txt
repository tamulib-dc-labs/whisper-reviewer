A Fair Maiden.

A pretty fair maiden in my garden,
A jolly cowboy came riding by,
And said, “Pretty miss, oh, will you marry?”
And said, “Pretty miss, will you marry me?” 

“Oh, no, no, my kind young fellow,
How would you pose a girl like me?
For I have a true love among the cowboys 
Has been gone from me three years today.” 

“Perhaps your lover he has drowned, 
Or perhaps he's by some Indian maid, 
Or perhaps he's to some pretty girl married, 
You'll never see his face again.”

“And if he's married, I hope he's happy.
Or if he's by some Indian maid, 
Or if he's to some pretty girl married, 
I love the girl that married he.”
