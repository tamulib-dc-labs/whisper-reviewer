She rode till she came to Lord Thomas' hall, 
she tingled at the ring, 
and none so ready as he himself 
to rise and bid her come in.

He took the brown girl by the hand, 
he led her down the hall, 
and with his sword cut off her head 
and kicked it against the wall.

He pulled her by the lily-white hand, 
he led her down the hall, the hall.
And up there, up there, up there, up thereâ€¦
before the ladies all.
