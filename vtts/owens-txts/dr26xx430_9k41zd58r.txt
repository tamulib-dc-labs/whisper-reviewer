My heart is broken. 
I'm in sorrow 
Weeping for the one I love.
For I know I ne'er shall see him 
Till we meet in heaven above.

Oh, bury me beneath the willow, 
Beneath the weeping willow tree, 
And when he knows where I lie sleeping,
He will then think of me.

Tomorrow was our wedding day,
God only knows where he may be;
He's gone to seek another bride,
And now he cares no more for me.

Oh, bury me beneath the willow, 
Beneath the weeping willow tree, 
And when he knows where I lie sleeping,
He will then think of me.
