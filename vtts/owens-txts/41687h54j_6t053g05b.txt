Give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

My home, my home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, 
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

How often at night, where the heavens are bright, 
The light of the glittering stars,
I stood there amazed, I ask as I gaze, 
If the glory exceeds that of ours.

My home, my home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, 
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
