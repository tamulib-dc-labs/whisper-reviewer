I've got trouble, double trouble. 
What a business, two.
What can I do?
I'm trying to be true, yes, to two.

If I lose one, then I gain one.
What a business, two. 
Maybe I look goofy, baby,
I'm trying to be true, yes, to two.

I can walk with them. 
I can talk with them.
I can spoon with them,
But I can't go on a honeymoon with both of them.

I've got trouble, double trouble. 
What a business, two. 
Yes, I'm crazy.
I'm trying to be true to two.
