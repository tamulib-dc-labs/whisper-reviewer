And “Lie still,” he said, 
And he ran across the prairie with a blanket over his head.

Many a time from out of saddle, Utah's held a trailing rope, 
For to help Lenore at full speed, for he knew his only hope.
Every boy on the cow range, they all gave a cry.
Utah saved the boss's daughter, but they knew that he would die.

Many a times that cattle, Utah held a trailing rope, 
For to help Lenore at full speed, for he knew his only hope.
Utah turned maddened cattle from Lenore, his little friend, 
Though the cattle came on rushing, and he stopped to meet his end.

Quickly then from out of cavern, Utah Carroll his pistol drew.
For he knew he must start fighting like a cowboy brave and true.
The pistol flashed light lolling, and the bullet seemed loud and clear, 
Though the cattle came on rushing, and he dropped the leading steer.

The cattle came on rushing and my partner had to fall, 
Never more to saddle a bronco or to give a cattle call.
He died out on the ranges and it seemed most awful hard 
That I could not reach the distance, not in time to say my part.

Every boy on the cow ranch knew how brave Utah died.
When they passed his grave in silence, they would speak his name with pride.
Went to church next Sunday morning, and I heard the preacher say 
That he knew that Utah Carroll wouldn’t be lost on that great day.
