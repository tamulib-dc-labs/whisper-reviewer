Two wings and glory to veil my face.
Two wings and glory…
Two wings and glory to veil my feet. 
Two wings and glory to fly away.

One of these mornings, morning, bright and fair.
One of these mornings, morning, bright and fair.
One of these mornings, morning, bright and fair.
Two wings to fly away.

Two wings and glory to veil my face. 
Two wings and glory…
Two wings and glory to veil my feet. 
Two wings and glory to fly away.

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. 
Two wings and glory to fly away.

Two wings and glory to veil my face. 
Two wings and glory…
Two wings and glory to veil my feet. 
Two wings and glory to fly away.
