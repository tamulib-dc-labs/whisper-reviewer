This is Colonel Denoon, Springfield, Missouri, and the song that I'm a-singin' entitled to Risslety Rosslety.

I married me a wife in the month of June, 
Risslety rosslety now now now 
Took her home by the light of the moon.
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.

Oh, she swept her floor but once a year.
Risslety rosslety now now now 
She swore her broom was all too dear.
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.

Oh, she combed her hair but once a year.
Risslety rosslety now now now 
With every rake she gave a tear
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.

Oh, she churned her butter in dad's old boot. 
Risslety rosslety now now now 
And for her dash she uses her foot. 
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.

Oh, the butter turned to a grizzly gray.
Risslety rosslety now now now 
The cheese took legs and ran away.
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.

Oh, the saddle and bridle is on old Jep. 
Risslety rosslety now now now 
You want it no more, you must sing it yourself. 
Risslety rosslety hey John dosslety, 
Nicklety, nacklety, 
Rusty ko cwally 
Ti Willie ti wally ti now now now.
