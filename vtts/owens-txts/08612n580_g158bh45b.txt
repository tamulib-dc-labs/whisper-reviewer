Sailor's trade is a dreary life, 
It robs poor girls of a harsh delight, 
Causes them to weep and mourn 
The loss of a true love never to return. 

Oh, brown be the color on my true love's hair 
His cheeks are like some lily fair. 
If he returns it'll bring me joy 
For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy.

She met three ships all come from Spain, 
All heavy loaded as they could swim.
She hailed each captain as they passed by, 
And there she inquired for her sweet sailor boy.

“Captain, captain, tell me true, 
Does sweet Willy sail with you?”
“No, no, he's not here, 
He got drowned in the gulf, my dear.”

She rang her hands and she tore her hair 
Like someone in deep despair. 
“If ever he returns it'll bring me joy 
For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy.”
