This is an old ballad that my grandmother taught me when I was a boy.

I am an old miser all ragged and damned, 
From Ireland and Ireland I came.
I met a maid both twenty and one,
And the very next morning my sorrows begun.

Oh, what shall I do to get rid of my pain?
I wish to my Lord I was single again.
Ever since my coffin was laid 
Before I had married this silly young maid.

Oh, what shall I do to get rid of my pain?
I wish to my lord that I was single again.
Ever since my coffin was laid 
Before I had married this silly young maid.

Oh, she dresses in satin and silks of all 
She goes to theaters and dances in balls.
Me in my rags and her in her lace 
And some other gentlemen comes to my place.

Oh, what shall I do to get rid of my pain?
I wish to my lord that I was single again.
Ever since my coffin was laid 
Before I had married this silly young maid.
