Still before, and I sang Down the Lonesome Road

One day as I was walking down the lonesome road, 
The spirit spoken to me, filled my heart with joy.
One day as I was walking down the lonesome road, 
While I'm in his care.

While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.
While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.
Oh, Jesus got his arms all around me,
There's nothing but the Lord can't harm me,
For I'm in his care.

Oh, mother, call her children round the bedside 
While she lay there dying, these are the words she says, 
“Children, I'm bound to leave you. 
Don't forget to pray while I'm in his care.

While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care. 
While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.
Oh, Jesus got his arms all around me,
There's nothing but the Lord can't harm me,
For I'm in his care.”
