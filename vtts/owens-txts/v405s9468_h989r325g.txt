To swing on the golden gates.

If I don't get there by and by.

Oh, I don't want to leave you behind.

When we reach that happy, happy climb.

Cause I'm bound to look first ray.
I must not lose  my luster 
When I swing on the golden gates.

Don't let me sleep too late.

To swing on the golden gates. 

Then wake me, shake me, 
Don't let me sleep too late.

To swing on the golden gates.
