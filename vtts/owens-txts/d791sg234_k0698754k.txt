Miss Freddie Lee Kirby, Galveston, Texas. Every time I feel the spirit.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

Up on the mountain, when my God spoke, 
Out of his mouth came fire and smoke.
Looked all around me, it looked so fine, 
Till I asked my Lord if all were mine.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

There ain't but one train upon this track. 
It runs through heaven and right back. 
Oh my Lord's done just what he said, 
Healed the sick and raised the dead.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
