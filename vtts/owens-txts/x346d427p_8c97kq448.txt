Rich Irish Lady.

A rich Irish lady from London she came,
Fine Sally, fine Sally indeed was her name.
A young man came courting numbers of years,
Toward this young lady his courtship did steer.

“Oh, Sally, oh, Sally, and Sally,” said he,
“I’m sorry that your love and mine can’t agree;
I know that your beauty will my ruin prove
Unless all your hatred will turn unto love.”

“Sir, to say that I hate you or any other man, 
Or to say that I love you is more than I can;
Neither love you nor hate you, but to end your discourse, 
I never will marry you unless I am forced.”

Before five and twenty weeks had quickly come and passed,
This young man had heard of her downfall at last.
She sent for this young man all like unto die,
All tangled in love, and she knew not for why.

“Am I any doctor, you’ve sent for me here,
Or am I the young man that once loved you dear?”
“You are the very one that can kill or can cure,
Without your assistance I’ll die I am sure.”
