Home Sweet Home.

Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which sweet through the world, is never met with elsewhere. 

Home, sweet home.
There's no place like home. 
There's no place like home.

An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain.
Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again.
The birds singing gaily that came at my call,
Give me them with peace of mind dearer than all.

Home, sweet home.
There's no place like home. 
There's no place like home.
