"Somebody's been eating my soup," said the great big old bear. Then the mama bear, the middle-sized bear said, "Somebody's been eating my soup." The baby bear: "Somebody's been eating my soup."

"Somebody's been sitting in my chair," growled the big old father bear. "Somebody's been sitting in my chair," said mother bear. "Somebody's been sitting in my chair and broke it all to pieces," cried the little bitty bear. 

Growl.
