Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain,
Daniel saw the stone that came rolling through Babylon,
Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain,
Coming down to redeem a mighty world.

Stone, stone, stone.

I found that stone that hewed out the mountain,
I found that stone that came rolling through Babylon,
I found that stone that hewed out the mountain,
Coming down to redeem a mighty world.

Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain,
Daniel saw the stone that came rolling through Babylon,
Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain,
Coming down to redeem a mighty world.

Stone, stone, stone.

Oh, Jesus was the stone that was hewed out the mountain,
Jesus was the stone that came rolling through Babylon,
Jesus was the stone that hewed out the mountain,
Coming down to redeem a mighty world.

Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain,

Coming down to redeem a mighty world.

Stone, stone, stone.

I found that stone that hewed out the mountain,
I found that stone that came rolling through Babylon,
I found that stone that hewed out the mountain,
Coming down to redeem a mighty world.
