Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

Up on this mountain, my Lord heard.
Out of his mountain, far as more.
Looked all around me, it looked so fine.
I asked unto Jesus, if all was mine.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

It ain't but one thing that I've done wrong
I stayed in need of little to love.
I was so saved on what he said.
So I can move my mouth as well.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
