My soul is a witness for my Lord,
My soul is a witness for my Lord,
I know I’m a witness for my Lord,
I know I’m a witness for my Lord,
God said I was a witness for my Lord, 
God said I was a witness for my Lord.

There was a man of the Pharisees 
Named Nicodemus and he would not believe.
He came to Jesus by night, 
Wanted to be taught out of human sight.

Jesus told him that he was a friend, 
Nicodemus needed to be born again. 
“Marvel not, if you want to be wise, 
Repent, believe, and be baptized.”

Then you’ll be a witness for my Lord,
Then you’ll be a witness for my Lord,
My soul is a witness for my Lord,
My soul is a witness for my Lord.

...Heal the guilty part of me.
Jesus was...
Leave me weak until I repent.

When I long many a day, 
Try to suffer my world away.
Everything like the scripture says
...upon my head.

...
There I need...
...my soul in need,
...

I'll be a witness for my Lord,
I'll be a witness for my Lord,
I'm glad I'm a witness for my Lord,
I'm glad I'm a witness for my Lord.
