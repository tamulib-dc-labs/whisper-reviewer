It’s Little Joe the Wrangler, he’ll wrangle nevermore.
His days with the remover they are over.
Was a year ago last April that he joined the outfit here.
A little Texas stray and all alone.
It was late in the evening when he rode up to our herd 
On a little Texas pony called Chow.
With his brogan shoes and overalls, a tougher looking kid 
You never in your life before had saw.

His saddle was a Texas Kack made many years ago 
With an O.K. spur on one foot loosely swung.
And his hot-roll was a cotton sack, a harder looking kid.
And the canteen from the saddle horn was swung.
He said he'd had to leave his home, his pa had married twice, 
And his new maw whipped him every day or two.
So he saddled up old Chow one night and lit a shuck this way, 
And he's now trying to paddle his own canoe.

Said if we would give him work he'd do the best he could,
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow.
So the boss, he cut him out a mound and kindly put him on, 
Cause he sort of liked that little kid somehow.
Learn him to wrangle horses and try to hold them all, 
And to get them in by daybreak if he could.
To follow the chuck wagon, to always hit the team, 
To help the cocinero rustle wood.

We had driven to the Pecos, the weather being fine, 
We had camped on the south side in a bend.
When the northern come in blowin', we had doubled up our guard, 
For it taken all of us to hold them in.
Little Joe the Wrangler was called out with the rest, 
Though the kid had scarcely reached the herd.
When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they fled 
And we were all a-riding for the lead.

Between the streaks of lightning the horse we could see ahead 
Was little Joe the Wrangler in the lead.
He was riding old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head 
Trying to check those cattle in their speed.
At last we got them milling and kind of quieted down 
And the extra guard back to the camp did go 
But there was one a-missing and we knew it at a glance 
Twas' our little Texas..
