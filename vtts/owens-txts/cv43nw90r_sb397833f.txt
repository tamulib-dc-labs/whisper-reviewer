When I can read my title clear 
To a mansion in the sky, 
I'll bid farewell to every fear
And wipe my weeping eyes. 

Should earth against my soul engage 
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan's rage 
And face a frowning world. 

Let cares like a wild deluge come. 
Let storms of sorrow fall,
May I but safely reach my home, 
My God, my heaven, my all.
