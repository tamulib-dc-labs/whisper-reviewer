Oh, you ought to have seen the Lord,
When he came from Jericho, 
There he goes all the way to Jerusalem,
Oh, you ought to have seen the Lord,
When he came from Jericho,
There he goes all the way to Jerusalem.
Well, well, well.

Oh, well, my Lord came from Jericho,
And the Lord... came that way,
Oh, well, he met an amazing woman,
And say, tell me a thing, Lord, why did you have?

Oh, you ought to have seen the Lord, 
And he came from Jericho, 
There he goes all the way to Jerusalem.
You ought to have seen the Lord, 
And he came from Jericho, 
There he goes to Jerusalem. 
Well, well, well.

Oh, well, he met an amazing woman,
She said, Lord, how can it be?
Oh, well, you know that you that you
And we have nothing to do with these.

Oh, you ought to have seen the Lord,
When he came from Jericho, 
There he goes all the way to Jerusalem.
You ought to have seen the Lord.
When he came from Jericho, 
There he goes to Jerusalem, 
Well, well, well.
