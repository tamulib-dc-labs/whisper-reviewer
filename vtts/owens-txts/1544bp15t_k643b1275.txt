Steal away, steal away to Jesus, 
Steal away, steal away, oh,
I ain't got long to stay, steal away.

Steal away, steal away to Jesus, 
Steal away, steal away, oh,
I ain't got long to stay, steal away.

My Lord called me, He called me back...
The trumpet sounds within my soul.
I ain't got long to stay, steal away.

Steal away, steal away to Jesus, 
Steal away, steal away, oh,
I ain't got long to stay, steal away.

Green trees are bending, 
Poor sinners stand a-trembling.
The trumpet sounds within my soul, 
I ain't got long to stay.
