Louise, you're the sweetest girl I know.
Louise, you're the sweetest girl I know.
You made me walk from Chicago to the Gulf of Mexico.

Now look-a here, Louise, now what you're trying to do? 
To give some other men your loving and me doing nothing, too?
You know, Louise, that will never do.
You can’t love me, and love some other men too.

Louise, I believe somebody been fishing in my pond.
Been catching all my perches and riling up the pond.
Louise, baby, whyn’t you love me more?
Ain’t had no loving since my Louise been gone.

I got a girl named Ura, she treats me nice and kind.
She gives me all her money, and keeps me on her mind.
She's not so good looking and her hair ain't even red.
She cooks my breakfast and brings it to me in bed.

Louise, whyn’t you love me more?
