By and by, I wait for the morning to come,
When all the saints of God are gathering home,
We will tell the story how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

We are often destituted of the things that life demands,
...Water and food, hills and barren land,
And I wonder why the test when we try to do our best,
And we'll understand it's better by and by.

Oh, by and by, I wait for the morning to come,
When all the saints of God are gathering home,
We will tell the story how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

The cry is dark on every hand and we cannot understand 
All the ways that God will lead us to his blessed promised land.
He will guide us with his eye and we'll follow till we die.
And we'll understand it better by and by.

By and by, I wait for the morning to come,
When all the saints of God are gathering home,
We will tell the story how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

By and by, I wait for the morning to come,
When all the saints of God are gathering home,
We will tell the story how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.
