And we'll understand it better by and by.

Oh, by and by, when the morning comes
All the saints of God are gathering home.
We will tell the story of how we'll overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares, often takes us unaware, 
And our hearts are made to bleed for some thoughtless word or deed
Oh, when we wonder why the test when we try to do our best, 
But we'll understand it better by and by. 

Oh, by and by, when the morning comes
All the saints of God are gathering home.
We will tell the story of how we'll overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Oh, by and by, when the morning comes
All the saints of God are gathering home.
We will tell the story of how we'll overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.
