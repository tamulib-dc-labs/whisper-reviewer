Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
And I don't want you to leave me behind.

There's a long white robe in heaven, I know, 
There's a long white robe in heaven, I know, 
There's a long white robe in heaven, I know,
And I don't want you to leave me behind.

Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
And I don't want you to leave me behind.

There's a starry crown in the heaven, I know,
There's a starry crown in the heaven, I know,
There's a starry crown in the heaven, I know,
And I don't want you to leave me behind.

Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
Good news, good news, the chariot's coming, 
And I don't want you to leave me behind.
