Lord, I'm going to be ready when he calls my name, 
Calls my name, calls my name.
Lord, I'm going to be ready when he calls my name.
Lord, I don't want to be one day too late.

One day too late. One day too late. 
One day too late. One day too late.

...call his name
Call his name, call his name.
...call his name.
Lord, he was one day too late.

One day too late. One day too late. 
One day too late. One day too late.

Oh preacher’s just a preacher when he calling his name,
Calling his name, calling his name.
Oh preacher’s just a preacher when he calling his name,
Lord, he just preached one day too late.

One day too late. One day too late. 
One day too late. One day too late.

Lord, I'm going to be ready when he calls my name, 
Calls my name, calls my name.
Lord, I'm going to be ready when he calls my name.
Lord, I don't want to be one day too late.
