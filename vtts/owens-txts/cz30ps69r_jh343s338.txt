Birmingham Jail.

Down in the valley, 
The valley so low,
Late in the evening 
Hear the train blow.
Hear the train blow, love, 
Hear that train blow,
Late in the evening, 
Hear the train blow.

Bird in the cage, love, 
Bird in the cage,
Swinging so high, love, 
Swinging so high.

Bird in the cage, love, 
Swinging so high.
Kiss me once, darling, 
Tell me goodbye.
Tell me goodbye, love, 
Tell me goodbye.
Kiss me once, darling, 
Tell me goodbye.

Bird in the cage, love, 
Swinging so high.
Kiss me once, darling,
Then I must go.
Then I must go, love, 
Then I must go.
Kiss me once, darling, 
Then I must go.

Oh, send me a letter, 
Send it by mail,
Send it in care of 
The Birmingham jail.
Birmingham jail, love, 
Birmingham jail,
Send it in care of 
The Birmingham jail.
