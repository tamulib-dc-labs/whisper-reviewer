She says, â€œBuddy oh Buddy, oh please don't go. 
Don't be forever away from home. 
There's many a gal more true than I. 
Don't go back west where the bullets fly. 

Oh curse your gold, your silver too.
God pity a woman that can't prove true.
I'll make my way to the Rio Grande, 
All the way out west with my cowboy band.
