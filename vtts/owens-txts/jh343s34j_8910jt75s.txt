My love is a rider, 
Wild Broncos he breaks, 
But he's promised to quit it 
Now just for my sake.

He ties up one foot 
And his saddle puts on, 
With a swing and a jump, 
He is mounted and gone.

The first time that I saw him 
Was early one spring. 
He was riding a bronco, 
A high-headed thing. 

He tipped me a wink 
As he gaily did go 
For he wished me to look 
At his bucking bronco. 

Next time that I saw him 
Was late in the fall. 
He was swinging the gals 
At the Tumlinson Ball.

He laughed and he talked 
As we danced to and fro.
He said he'd quit riding 
His bucking Bronco.

My love has a gun 
And that gun he can use.
But he's quit his gunfighting 
As well as his booze.

He's sold his old saddle, 
His spurs and his rope.
And he's quit his gun-fighting, 
And that's what I hoped.

He said he would marry 
If he stayed out of jail, 
But when it was springtime 
He went up the trail.

He said he would marry, 
But he kissed me goodbye, 
And went up the trail 
With the half-circle Y.

Now all you young maidens, 
Where'er you reside, 
Beware of the cowboy 
Who swings the rawhide.

He'll court you and pet you 
And leave you and go 
In the spring up the trail 
On his bucking bronco.
