Come all young people and listen to my song,
Tell you the young man that wouldn’t hoe his corn, 
For the reason why I cannot tell, this young man was always well.
For the reason why I cannot tell, this young man was always well.

He went to his cornfield, and there he peeped in,
The weeds and grass were up to his chin,
The careless weeds did grow so high made this young man weep and cry,
The careless weeds did grow so high made this young man weep and cry.

He went to his nearest neighbor's house 
Courting as you might suppose.
The conversation did begin, “Say, young man, have you hoed your corn?”
The conversation did begin, “Say, young man, have you hoed your corn?”

He answered her with a sweet reply, 
“Yes, my dear, I've laid it by,
For it ain’t worthwhile to strive in vain, for don't believe I’ll raise one grain,
For it ain’t worthwhile to strive in vain, for don't believe I’ll raise one grain.”

“If you don't believe you'll raise your bread, 
Why do you hope to strive to wed?
For single I am and single I’ll remain, a lazy man I won't maintain,
For single I am and single I’ll remain, a lazy man I won't maintain.”

Now he's going to see a widow, 
I'm in hopes that he won't get her.
For the rake or a hoe, the handle of the plow would suit him much better than a wife right now.

He can't raise bread and he can't get a wife,
Bound to live a bachelor the balance of his life,
For a single I am and single I’ll remain
