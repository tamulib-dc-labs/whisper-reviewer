Use me, Lord, in thy service,
Draw me nearer every day,
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way,
If I fall down, while I'm trying, don't be angry,
Let me stay,
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way.

Pain by heartaches,
Gone by loved ones, 
A little sunshine, every now and then.
There are mountains in my life so hard to climb, 
That I promised I would keep climbing if you would only
Let me in. 
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way. 

All the way, all the way,
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way,
If I fall down while I'm trying, don't be angry,
Let me stay,
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way.
