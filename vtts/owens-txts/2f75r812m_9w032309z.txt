Drifting Further From Me by Tom Ballentine.

There is something wrong between us.
I'm about to lose my Venus.
Each day we are drifting further apart.
When my loving word don't warm you, 
And my rabbit foot don't charm you, 
There's signs some nigga’s fooling with your heart.

You are drifting further from me, baby.
You're some other nigga's lady.
That's the reason why you keep throwing me off this way.
Some other coon, he's got a little more money.
Spends it all on you, my honey.
You're drifting further from me every day.

I never did abuse you, honey, and I never did refuse you.
I don't think it's no lady acting,
You keep throwing all this away.
I ain't no fortune teller, 
But I believe you got another fella, 
For you are drifting further from me every day.

You are drifting further from me, baby.
You some other nigga's lady.
That's the reason why you keep throwing me off this way.
Some other coon, he's got a little more money.
Spends it all on you, my honey.
You're drifting further from me every day.

I called to see you Sunday, 
And so did I on Monday,
Tuesday night and Wednesday night, you wasn't at home.
I could not see you Thursday, 
I wonder where you'll be 
Friday night and Saturday night, too, when I come.

See, she's gone all the way, drifting further from me, baby.
You some other nigga’s lady.
That's the reason why you keep throwing me off this way.
Some other coon, he's got a little more money,
Spends it all on you, my honey,
You're drifting further from me every day.
