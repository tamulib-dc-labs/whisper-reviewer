The Irish Girl by Daniel Jeffus.

As I walked out one morning 
Down by the riverside, 
My eyes were cast around me 
And an Irish girl went by.
So red and rosy were her cheeks, 
And so curly was her hair, 
And so costly was the jewelry 
That Irish girl did wear.

The tears came trickling down her cheeks 
And she began to cry. 
She said, “My true love's gone to Ireland 
And highly forsaken am I. 
I wish I was in Ireland 
Sitting in a chair 
Within my hands a glass of wine 
And my true love by my side. 

“I wish I was in Ireland 
Sitting in a chair 
Within my hands a glass of wine 
And my true love by my side. 
I'd call for candy kisses 
And pay them as I go.
I'd sail aloft the ocean, 
Let the winds blow high or low.
Love, oh love, it's a killing thing.
Did you ever feel the pain?
How hard it is to love anyone 
And never be loved again.”
