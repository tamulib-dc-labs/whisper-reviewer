I was born in Boston City, a place you all know well.
Brought up by honest parents, a truth to you I tell.
Yes, brought up by honest parents and raised most tenderly.
Till I became a sporting man at the age of twenty-three.

And then my cash was taken, and I was sent to jail.
My parents tried to bail me out, but it was of no avail.
The juryman found me guilty, the clerk, he wrote it down.
The judge pronounced my sentence to go to Charlestown.

I saw my aged parents
I saw my aged father a-standing at the bar.
Like my, my aged mother a-pulling out her hair.
Yes, pulling out those old gray locks, big tears came rolling down.
Saying, “My son, what have you done to be sent to Charlestown?”

They put me on board an eastbound train one cold December day.
And every station I pass through, I heard those people say, 
There goes that Boston burglar, with iron chains bound down.
For some crime he has done, he's bound for Charlestown.

There's a girl in Boston City, a girl that I love well. 
If ever I get my liberty along with her I'll dwell. 
Yes, if ever I get my liberty, bad company I'll shun, 
Likewise night walking and gambling and also drinking of rum. 

Come all young men who have your liberty, pray keep it while you can.
And don't go around those towns at night to break the laws of men.
For if you do, you soon will rue when the world will frown on you.
And you'll be serving twenty-one years in a penitentiary.
