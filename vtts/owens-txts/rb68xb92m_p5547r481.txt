As I walked out on one morning for pleasure, 
I spied a cowpuncher all riding along.
His head was thrown back and his spurs were a-jinglin' 
And as he approached me, he was singing this song.

Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

It's early in the spring that we round up the dogies.
We mark them and brand them and bob off their tails.
We round up the horses, load up the chuck wagons.
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail.

Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

Now some boys go up the trail for pleasure, 
But that's where they get it most awfully wrong.
For you haven't any idea the trouble they give us 
As we go a-driving the dogies along.

Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

Your mother was raised away down in Texas 
Where the jimpson weeds and the sand-burrs grow.
But now we will feed you on prickly and choya 
Till you are ready for Idaho.

Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
It's your misfortune and none of my own.
Whoopie-ti-yi-yo, get along little dogies. 
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.
