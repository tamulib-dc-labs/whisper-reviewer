Barbara Allen from Mrs. I. L. Stowe.

It was in the merry month of June 
When the red rose was blooming.
Sweet William Gray rode from a north country.
Fell in love with Barbry Allen.

Oh. 
He sent his servant down to camp, 
Where Miss Barbry was dwelling.
She says, come.
When Miss Barbry was dwelling, 
“My master’s sick, he says come down
If you please, Miss Barbry Allen.”

Slowly, slowly she got up 
And slowly she went to him. 
And as she could say, when she got there, 
“Young man, I think you're dying.”

He turned his pale face to the wall
She turned her face upon him.
He says, kind friend, stand around my bed.
Remember Barbry Allen.

As she was walking up and down the street, 
She saw his cold corpse coming.
And at the corner of every street.
Saying woe to Barbry Allen.

Sweet William Gray, died for love today.
And I’ll die for sorrow tomorrow.
