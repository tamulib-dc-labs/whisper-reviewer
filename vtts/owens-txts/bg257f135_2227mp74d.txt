This is an old song, The Little Sparrow, or Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June 5, 1939.

Come all ye fair and tender ladies, 
Take warning how you treat young men.
They're like a star in a cloudy morning. 
They're here and then they're gone.

They'll tell to you some lonesome story. 
They'll prove to you their love is true.
And then they'll go and court another. 
That is the love they have for you.

I wish I was a little sparrow.
And I had wings and I could fly. 
I'd fly away to my false lover. 
And there I'd sit me down and cry. 

But I am not a little sparrow
I have no wings and cannot fly. 
So I lay me down in my grief and sorrow. 
I lay me down until I die.
