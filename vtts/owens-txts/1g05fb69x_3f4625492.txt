He turned his face to the milk white wall 
And death was on him dwellin'. 
Farewell, farewell to all false maids 
And woe to Barbara Ellen. 

When she was walkin' in the field 
She heard the death bell knellin'
And every toll it seemed to say.
Hard-hearted Barbara Ellen.

She looked to the east and she looked to the west, 
And she saw the cold corpse coming
“Lay down, lay down, lay down, that cold, cold corpse 
That I may gaze upon him.”

Oh, mother, mother, go make my shroud, 
Go make it long and narrow.
Sweet William died for me today 
And I'll die for him tomorrow. 

They buried her in the lone churchyard 
Sweet William lay a-nigh her 
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose
and out of her grave grew a briar.

They climbed, they climbed to the tall church top 
Till they could go no higher.
And there they tied in a true lover's knot 
The rose wrapped around the briar.
