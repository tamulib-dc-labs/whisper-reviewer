Been listening all day long,
Been listening all night long,
Been listening all day long,
To hear some sinner pray.

I know I’ve been converted
And I ain’t gonna feel no alarm,
My soul is anchored in Jesus
And I am safe from harm.

Been listening all day long,
Been listening all night long,
Been listening all day long,
To hear some sinner pray.

Some say that John the Baptist
Was nothing but a Jew,
But the Holy Bible tells me 
He was a preacher too.

Been listening all day long,
Been listening all night long,
Been listening all day long,
To hear some sinner pray.
