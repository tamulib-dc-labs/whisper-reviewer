By and by, when the morning comes,
When all the saints are gathering home,
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares, often takes us unaware
And a heart to be made bleed for the blessed man indeed.
And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

By and by, when the morning comes,
When all the saints are gathering home,
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

By and by, when the morning comes
When all the saints are gathering home
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome
And we'll understand it better by and by.
