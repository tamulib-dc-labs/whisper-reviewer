Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me,
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind, but now I see.

‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved,
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come,
‘Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
