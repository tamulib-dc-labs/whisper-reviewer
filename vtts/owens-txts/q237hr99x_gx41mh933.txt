Tell me, how did you feel
When you come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
Oh, how did you feel
When you come out of the wilderness,
Leaning on the Lord?

Leaning, Leaning, Leaning, Leaning.

Well, I felt like leaning
When I come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
Well, I felt like leaning
When I come out of the wilderness,
Leaning on the Lord?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new.

Well, I felt brand new
When I come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness.
Oh I felt brand new
When I come out of the wilderness,
Leaning on the Lord.

Shouting, shouting, shouting, shouting. 

Well, I felt like shouting
When I come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
come out of the wilderness,
Well, I felt like shouting
When I come out of the wilderness,
Leaning on the Lord?
