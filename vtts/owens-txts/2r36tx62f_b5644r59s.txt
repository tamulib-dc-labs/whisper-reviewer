It's Hangman's Tree, by Mrs. I. L. Stowe.

Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack for a while.
I think I see my own dear father come riding many miles.

Oh, father, did you pay my gold, or did you bring my fee,
Or did you come to see me hanged to yonders willow tree?

Oh, no, I did not bring your gold and did not pay your fee.
I come to see you hanged to yonders willow tree.

Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack it for a while.
I think I see my own dear mother come riding many a mile.

Oh mother did you bring my gold, or did you pay my fee,
Or did you come to see me hanged to yonders willow tree?

Oh, no, I did not bring your gold or did not pay your fee.
I come to see you hanged to yonders willow tree.

Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack it for a while.
I think I see my own true love come riding many a mile.

Oh, true love, did you bring my gold, or did you pay my fee,
Or did you come to see me hanged to yonders willow tree?

Oh, yes, I brought you gold, my dear, and also paid your fee.
I did not come to see you hanged to yonders willow tree.
