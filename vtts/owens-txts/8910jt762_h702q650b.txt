This is Donald Davidson. I'll sing a song that I learned from my father in Tennessee, Frog Went a-Courting.

Frog went a-courting and he did ride, and a-hum,
Frog went a-courting and he did ride, 
Sword and pistol by his side, and a-hum.

He took little Mousy on his knee, and a-hum,
He took little Mousy on his knee, 
And he said, little Mousy, will you marry me, and a-hum.

Oh no, no, no, not without Uncle Rat's consent, and a-hum,
Oh no, no, no, not without Uncle Rat's consent,
I would not marry the President, and a-hum. 

Old Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat side, and a-hum, 
Old Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat side,
 To think his niece would be a bride, and a-hum. 

Oh where will the wedding supper be, and a-hum,
Oh, where will the wedding supper be?
Away down yon in the hollow beech tree, and a-hum.

Oh, what will the wedding supper be, and a-hum,
Oh, what will the wedding supper be?
Three green beans and a black-eyed pea, and a-hum.
