Go to sleepy, little baby
‘Fore the booger man catch you,
When you wake gonna have a piece of cake, 
A horse and four little ponies, 
A dapple and a gray and a black and a bay, 
Go to sleepy little baby.

Goodbye, I'm sorry to leave you,
Goodbye, I'm sorry to leave you,
Goodbye, I'm sorry to leave you,
Gonna leave you in God's care.

Gonna leave you with the prayer books and the Bible, 
Gonna leave you with the prayer books and the Bible, 
Gonna leave you with the prayer books and the Bible, 
Gonna leave you in God's care. 

Swing low, sweet chariot.
Coming for to carry me home.
Swing low, sweet chariot.
Coming for to carry me home. 

If you get there before I do 
Coming for to carry me home.
Just tell the Lord, I’m a-comin' too.
Coming for to carry me home.

Swing low, sweet chariot.
Coming for to carry me home.
Swing low, sweet chariot.
Coming for to carry me home.
