If it were not for the Lord, now tell me what would I do? 
Now tell me what would I do?
Now tell me what would I do?
If it were not for the Lord, tell me what would I do? 
He is everything to me.

He is water in dry places
He is bread in a starving land.
Heâ€™s my rock and shelter, 
He holds me in his hand.
When all the world forsakes me
Close by my side he stands,
He is everything to me.

If it were not for the Lord, now tell me what would I do? 
Now tell me what would I do?
Now tell me what would I do?
If it were not for the Lord, tell me what would I do? 
He is everything to me.

When I were in trouble
And my way seemed dark as night
Jesus gave me comfort
Brought me to the light
He took my sorrows
And he made my burdens light,
He is everything to me.

If it were not for the Lord, now tell me what would I do? 
Now tell me what would I do?
Now tell me what would I do?
If it were not for the Lord, tell me what would I do? 
He is everything to me.
