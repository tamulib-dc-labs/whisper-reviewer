By and by.

By and by, oh, by and by.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.

By and by, oh, by and by.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.

I know my robe's going to fit me well
I'm going to lay down my heavy load. 
I tried it on at the gate of hell.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.
