As I walked out for pleasure one evening in May, 
For a sweet recreation I scarcely can say. 
As I sat amusing myself in the shade, 
Oh who should come near me but a young Indian maid.

She sat down beside me and taking my hand, 
Says she “I see you are a stranger, not one of our land.
But if you will follow, you're welcome to come
And share in my cottage, the humblest of homes.”

Together we wandered, and together we roamed,
Till we came to a loghut in a coconut grove,
With kindly impressions she said unto me. 
“If you will consent, sir, and live here with me, 
And go no more ramblings all o'er the South Sea, 
I'll teach you the language of Little Mohea.”

“Oh, no, pretty maiden, this never could be.
I have a true lover all o'er the South Sea.
I could not forsake her and live here with thee, 
For her heart beats as truly as Little Mohea.”

This fair young lady, she's handsome and kind.
She acted her part as a heaven design,
For I was a stranger and she took me to her home, 
And I think of Little Mohea as I wander alone. 

The last time I saw her she stood on the sand, 
As our ship passed by her, she waved me her hand.
Saying “When you get back to the girl that you love
Just think of Little Mohea in a coconut grove.”

Now I am safe landing on Hudson’s green shore,
Where my friends and companions can see me once more.
The girls all crowd round me, but none do I see
That can compare with my Little Mohea.
