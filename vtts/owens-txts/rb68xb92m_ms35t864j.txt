Windy Bill, sung by Brownie McNell, Austin, Texas, February 19th.

Oh, Windy Bill was a Texas guy, 
And he could rope, you bet.
He allowed the steer, he could not ride 
He had not found him yet.

Now the boys all knew of an old black steer, 
A sort of an old outlaw 
That ran down in the chaparral 
Just at the head of the draw.

Now this old black steer that stood his ground 
With punchers from everywhere, 
So they bet old Bill that two to one
He could not get quite there.

So Bill brought out his old grey horse, 
His withers and back were raw 
To tackle that big black brute 
That ran down in the draw.

With his brazen bit and his Sam Stack tree, 
And his chaps and taps to boot 
And his old maguey tied hard and fast, 
Bill swore he'd get that brute.

Now first Bill sort of sauntered around, 
Old Blackie began to paw.
Then threw his tail straight in the air, 
Went a-drifting down the draw.

The old gray horse flew after him, 
For he had been eating corn.
And Bill, he piled his old maguey 
Right around old Blackie's horns.

The old grey horse, he stopped dead still.
The cinches broke like straw.
And the old maguey and the Sam Stack tree 
Went a-driftin' down the draw.

Bill, he lit in the flint rock pile, 
His face and hands were scratched.
He said he thought he could rope a snake, 
But he guessed he'd met his match.

He paid his bets like a little man 
Without a bit of jaw.
He allowed old Blackie was the boss 
Of anything in that draw.
