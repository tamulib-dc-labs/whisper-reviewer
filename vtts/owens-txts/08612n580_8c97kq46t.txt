My old daddy-in-law's getting very cross.
He neither will give me a cow nor a horse.
He'll give me a kick and he told me to go 
Sick-a-jiddle in a banjo land.

Shell, shell, shallow wiggles around.
Shoely, yanky, shanky, yanky, shoely, pop-a-cue.
Cross-cut wad and a hoo-jolly 
Sick-a-jiddle in a banjo land.
