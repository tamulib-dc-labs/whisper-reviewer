Still as before, now sing Ride On, King Jesus.

Oh, ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
I want to go to heaven in the morning. 

Oh, ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
I want to go to heaven in the morning.

You see, my father, please tell him for me.
He's got the mountains, 
Those horses on the battlefield 
If he wants to go to heaven in the morning.

Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.

Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
I want to go to heaven in the morning. 

Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.

Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
Ride on, ride on King Jesus, 
I want to go to heaven in the morning.
