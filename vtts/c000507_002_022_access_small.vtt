Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.440
No, the radio station hasn't queued up the wrong program. This is Daryl Lane.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.980
And David Carson, and this is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

01:11.420 --> 01:15.340
Many of you undoubtedly recognize the music as being from Jim Henson's new movie, The Dark Crystal.

01:15.740 --> 01:19.280
The music was composed by Trevor Jones and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.420
It's a fantasy film in which the heroes, two elfin-like creatures called gelflings,

01:23.660 --> 01:28.700
have to overcome some almost insurmountable tasks in order to keep the evil Skexus from taking over the world.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.180
The Skexus were not always evil. In fact, they weren't always called the Skexus.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.860
They were once called the Urskex, but in trying to become totally good, the Urskex made a terrible mistake.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.500
This caused them to be split into the Uru who are good and the Skexus who are evil.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.520
And in their first rage, the Skexus broke a piece from a magical crystal,

01:45.800 --> 01:48.780
and the world of the Uru, Skexus, and gelflings became dark.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.240
And replacing the missing piece of the crystal is the quest the gelflings undertake.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.680
The creatures used in the movie are much like the one used in the movie E.T., The Extraterrestrial.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.340
Except that Henson's crew had dozens of creatures all on the screen at the same time,

02:20.580 --> 02:22.740
which made performing them somewhat difficult at times.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.400
Henson tells us that things weren't quite as drastic as in filming the Muppet movie,

02:26.400 --> 02:31.800
where he was sealed up in a watertight drum and lowered into the swamp in order to perform Kermit singing on a lock.

02:32.620 --> 02:37.080
We never had anything that was quite claustrophobic.

02:39.260 --> 02:44.460
Unfortunately, I'm not a claustrophobic person, so I don't mind being squinted into a small space.

02:46.280 --> 02:53.060
But in the Muppet movie, in the Great Muppet Caper, we would very often find ourselves in a situation

02:53.060 --> 03:02.040
where we were out in the real world, like riding in a taxi cab, where there might be three or four of us jammed underneath

03:02.840 --> 03:06.600
where the seat would have been in a regular automobile.

03:07.900 --> 03:13.180
But since this film was all in a fantasy world, which was designed for us to operate in,

03:13.780 --> 03:16.420
we virtually never had that same kind of discomfort.

03:17.460 --> 03:24.280
So all of our sets were designed with knowing that we wanted to be able to get underneath the ground

03:24.280 --> 03:27.900
or through a rock wall.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.200
So all of it was designed with trapdoors or areas that could be removed.

03:48.060 --> 03:52.980
The design and construction by Henson's group and artist Brian Froud is quite an interesting process also.

03:53.700 --> 04:00.360
Brian would do an original sketch, and then we would turn that, we would go to a,

04:01.280 --> 04:10.740
have one of our sculptors then sculpt the figure, and then we would mock it up so that we could manipulate it.

04:11.330 --> 04:16.640
And then we would try moving this thing. These things moved in different ways.

04:18.360 --> 04:26.460
We would videotape a test, and then we'd all sit around and look at the test and decide what should be done about it.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.320
And then Brian would normally redesign the character, you know, the whole process would begin again.

04:45.260 --> 04:50.040
Jim Hanson's new movie, The Dark Crystal, is quite a remarkable achievement. Go see for yourself.

05:00.080 --> 05:05.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:05.460 --> 05:08.640
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
