00:01.560 --> 00:12.820
the way in which they look at the world. He goes on to say that fantasy is
popular because looking forward is too gloomy. It's a depressing activity,

00:12.820 --> 00:21.800
whereas nostalgia is usually a thing that people like to do. And it would be
interesting to see if you found that when you reviewed the fantasy field and

00:21.800 --> 00:30.660
compared it with science fiction, that fantasy does go backwards for its roots.
I tend to think it does. By the way, the tape is running again, but one of the

00:30.660 --> 00:39.980
questions I was going to ask you just a little bit later, too, was if you ever
intended to try some pure fantasy yourself. I've written only one story that I

00:39.980 --> 00:52.620
would consider true fantasy, which is a parody or an imitation of P.G.
Woodhouse, in which I'm very fond of P.G. Woodhouse as a comedy writer, as a

00:52.620 --> 01:03.880
humorous writer. And I wrote a story called The Marriage of True Minds, in which
I took his characters and settings and wrote a fantasy. Other than that, I don't

01:03.880 --> 01:16.620
see that I'm strongly drawn to fantasy. Erasmus Darwin and the Erasmus Magister
stories are close to fantasy, and I don't think I will get much closer than

01:16.620 --> 01:33.760
that. It's not where my reading interests lie, and I would find that I cannot
see quite how I would avoid trying to explain things. In writing The Selkie with

01:33.760 --> 01:45.220
David Bischoff, one of the things I always found when we were writing was that I
have a very strong desire to explain what is happening and not be happy to leave

01:45.220 --> 01:54.360
it as a supernatural event. And the same thing was true in writing about Erasmus
Darwin. I think that would stop me writing fantasy. I might start out thinking

01:54.360 --> 02:07.440
it was fantasy, but if I explained it in some logical or scientific terms, then
it's no longer fantasy. Yeah, last week we talked to Damon Knight, and I talked

02:07.440 --> 02:14.220
about his latest novel, The World and Thorinn, and I called it a fantasy novel,
and he stopped me immediately and asked me why I said it was fantasy, because it

02:14.220 --> 02:22.220
was obviously science fiction. He provided the background in the book very
subtly, and I just hadn't picked it out carefully enough. Well, there's also a

02:22.220 --> 02:34.000
category which I call science fantasy, in which the vocabulary of science is
used, but it's not used in any scientifically plausible way. In other words,

02:34.420 --> 02:43.420
anybody can talk about the uncertainty principle and black holes, but if what
they then go on and do is scientific gibberish, it's using the trappings of

02:43.420 --> 02:53.500
science, which makes it sound like science fiction, but it's really fantasy, and
you see lots of that. I don't know, I haven't read or even seen Damon Knight's

02:53.500 --> 03:06.460
book, so I can't tell whether I would consider it science fantasy or science
fiction, and they're quite different in my mind. Anyhow, your question of a few

03:06.460 --> 03:13.620
moments ago, I would agree that probably fantasy does go backwards, and it's
more of an escape, whereas science fiction, you have to confront things, you

03:13.620 --> 03:21.380
have to look to the future, and some people, I guess, maybe because of the state
of the economy or something, prefer looking backwards these days. Yeah, I

03:21.380 --> 03:34.280
believe, as a matter of fact, it's almost impossible to write science fiction in
a multiple book series, because the essence of science fiction to me is that you

03:34.280 --> 03:44.680
are constantly moving to new things you haven't considered before. If you can
write a trilogy about something, you're probably writing fantasy, because you

03:44.680 --> 03:55.540
don't have the constant spacing of true unknowns going on all the time through a
trilogy. You usually have a rather comfortable setting established against which

03:55.540 --> 04:00.340
the trilogy or more books develop.

04:03.260 --> 04:11.040
David here has just thought of a question on this topic he would like to ask
you, Dr. Sheffield. Brian. Yes, you were talking about not really being

04:11.040 --> 04:19.580
comfortable with writing fantasy. I'd wondered, Stephen King writes horror, but
a lot of his horror fiction has science fiction background to it, like Carrie

04:19.580 --> 04:31.500
telekinesis, that's sort of science background, but I'd wonder if you'd ever
considered writing horror. Yeah, well, this book I mentioned that I wrote in

04:31.500 --> 04:42.720
collaboration with another Washington writer, David Bischoff, is science fiction
horror, is the closest thing we can come to describing it. An alternative type

04:42.720 --> 04:56.740
description would be science fiction gothic, but it has explicitly gruesome
things, and it has some explicitly frightening things, and the reviewers have

04:56.740 --> 05:06.040
been saying this is sort of Stephen King style. So I found that a very
interesting exercise, and I quite like to read horror books, and I very much

05:06.040 --> 05:15.820
like to read Stephen King books, so I'd be quite comfortable attempting that. I
think I would find it harder to write a Salem's Lot type of book, because he

05:15.820 --> 05:30.000
very much is writing a real supernatural vampire book in that, whereas in The
Stand, for example, he is writing what I consider to be really science fiction.

05:31.160 --> 05:42.920
And The Dead Zone is somewhere between the two. I like that, but I felt it was
somewhere between science fiction and realism and horror. I don't know how to

05:42.920 --> 05:58.880
define that mixture. Yeah, I thought The Stand was just a standard, although
excellently written, post-Holocaust book. That's right. It had overtones, which

05:58.880 --> 06:08.820
are not explained as to how things happen, but it was science fiction. As much
as anything King has ever written, I think, is science fiction. I have not read

06:08.820 --> 06:15.840
his latest collection of four novellas, though. I haven't seen that yet. I think
that's, again, a horror, though.

06:18.780 --> 06:27.760
Okay, let me change the direction for a second here. Sometimes you write what I
guess I would call sort of a message story, something like The Man Who Sold the

06:27.760 --> 06:37.840
Moon or Bounded in a Nutshell, where you talk about space program and so forth.
The Man Who Sold the Moon, I thought, was beautiful satire, and I wondered if

06:37.840 --> 06:50.460
you had much reader response about that one. No, I think zero is the way to put
that. It was very much influenced by a Heinlein story, The Man Who Sold the

06:50.460 --> 06:59.500
Moon, and it was preaching a bit. And I think that's an example where you said
there was a message, and I said I was preaching. But I haven't really had any

06:59.500 --> 07:12.820
response. And I'm not quite sure what response I would expect for that. I think
that most people who read it and approve of it are already upset at the way we

07:12.820 --> 07:21.360
seem to be unable to have an effective space program. So the only sort of
letters I might think I would get would be people who would agree with it. But I

07:21.360 --> 07:24.720
haven't had those either. It really hasn't produced much reader reaction.

07:27.940 --> 07:36.820
That series on Henry Carver that you've done, I read a little piece that you'd
written where you called it a sewage series, and I wondered why you called it

07:36.820 --> 07:53.380
that. Well, because two of the first three involved, well, let me put it
differently. The first one of all was one involving the Matting link, which was

07:53.380 --> 08:04.960
not particularly loathsome in any way. But then the next one was about one of
the lawyers who was working in charge of the sewers on a space station. That was

08:04.960 --> 08:18.680
Dinsdale Descent, unduly falls into the sewer. Then another one, which is the
Dalmatian spouse, the same individual again falls into a different sewer. And

08:18.680 --> 08:31.980
generally speaking, I regard those stories as stories in which I take ideas that
people have said are gross and unpleasant and loathsome and disgusting and put

08:31.980 --> 08:40.960
them into stories. And one evening at dinner, we made a long list of things that
people found generally distasteful. And the suggestion was I should just write

08:40.960 --> 08:50.240
my way through the list until I got to the end. And I find that that's all right
to a limited extent if you're writing what you hope are humorous stories, like

08:50.240 --> 09:04.940
Parasites Lost is about a truffle pig. And the Deimos Plague is another in a
series in which a man has to safeguard two large pigs, taking them out to Mars.

09:05.620 --> 09:15.120
The stories generally are not intended to have any message, as you might say,
the man who stole the moon has, or any redeeming features. I just write them

09:15.120 --> 09:25.840
because I find them amusing. It's very hard to tell whether readers find them
amusing or not. So certain writers always quote those stories to me. It's

09:25.840 --> 09:38.460
interesting. For instance, Jerry Pournelle actually remembers verbatim certain
lines from perfectly safe, nothing to worry about, and always quotes them to me.

09:38.620 --> 09:49.140
So it obviously strikes a chord somewhere, but I never consider those stories
will be very popular. I think that they're for a rather odd sense of humor. And

09:49.140 --> 09:57.440
some of the jokes don't work, by the way, as I found after I'd written the
stories, because certain things are said in England that are not used in

09:57.440 --> 10:12.060
America. For example, in England, the word primate is used very commonly to mean
either a member of the gorilla, chimpanzee, or human family, and monkeys

10:12.060 --> 10:20.860
generally, or else it's used to mean a high official of the church. Whereas I
find in this country, although the word is permitted in both senses in the

10:20.860 --> 10:31.040
dictionaries, almost no one uses it that way. And so I wrote a joke based around
that, and to most readers, I'm sure it just fell flat. Well, we've enjoyed those

10:31.040 --> 10:38.320
stories a great deal. In fact, I wanted to ask you if you had planned any more
of them. Well, I have one that's sitting there somewhat... I've got about eight

10:38.320 --> 10:53.700
pages, and I stopped and did other things. A story called Space Opera, which
involves the same characters, and what happens when this producer decides to

10:53.700 --> 11:01.900
stage a modern opera which has been written. It's called Balaclava, and they
decide to stage it in free fall with the charge of the Light Brigade and other

11:01.900 --> 11:09.420
complications. But I haven't written the rest of it because I've been too busy
writing other things. It's sitting there over on the desk there, and sometime

11:09.420 --> 11:20.380
I'll write it. But I write those occasionally with no fixed timetable just when
I feel like it. Another one of your short stories, the one that was entitled

11:20.380 --> 11:29.360
Forefather Figure, you had an afterword to that where you said time travel into
the past would be absolutely impossible. And I've been reading a lot recently in

11:29.360 --> 11:40.240
my science magazines about physicists talking about time travel, and I wondered
why you thought it would be absolutely impossible. Well, the magazine articles

11:40.240 --> 11:52.820
usually make use of certain properties of rotating black holes or rotating
massive cylinders in which there appears to be something peculiar going on on

11:52.820 --> 12:08.300
the time axis. But as I mentioned in the afterword, the idea that a person can
go back in time and do something which then leads to his own disappearance and

12:08.300 --> 12:18.340
his own never having existed seems to me a very severe logical problem. If
somebody can go back and essentially cause themselves never to have been there,

12:18.600 --> 12:21.140
then that's a disturbing situation.

12:23.980 --> 12:35.280
The usual explanation as to what happens is that at that point, if you like,
time moves off onto a different branch, almost like throwing the points on a

12:35.280 --> 12:48.120
railway line. But the fact then is that you have not changed what the original
timeline looked like. It's a very confusing situation. As people have said, our

12:48.120 --> 12:57.960
desire to have things causally related, causally effectively related, is a
function of the way our brains operate and not necessarily the way that the

12:57.960 --> 13:09.140
universe operates. But even given, I'll admit that, but I still find it hard to
see how you can explain this grandfather paradox in that I will use my time

13:09.140 --> 13:21.400
travel, go back and shoot my grandfather before my father was conceived. At
which point, I will have ceased to exist. And on the other hand, I've only

13:21.400 --> 13:29.520
ceased to exist because I went back and shot my grandfather. So it's an absolute
paradox that you can't explain because if I didn't exist, I couldn't have shot

13:29.520 --> 13:31.960
him. I just don't see a way out of that.

13:35.000 --> 13:46.520
Okay. Of course, today, there are a number of scientists like yourself who do
write science fiction. And I wondered, I guess you've sort of answered this or

13:46.520 --> 13:58.080
alluded to it a few times in the interview. How do you find the time to write
and still practice your profession as a scientist? Well, I don't write as much

13:58.080 --> 14:12.820
as what my wife would call real writers write. Full-time writers should be able
to produce a lot more than I do. One reason I produce as much as I do produce is

14:12.820 --> 14:23.380
because I enjoy it. I consider it a form of pleasure and relaxation. And so I do
it for choice when I'm not doing other things. But I feel that if I didn't have

14:23.380 --> 14:33.900
a job, I might write a lot more, but I would probably enjoy it a lot less. And
in terms of somebody who is prolific, I don't produce much at all. If you look

14:33.900 --> 14:45.600
at the productivity of, well, now I have to think of somebody who's prolific. I
suppose Andy Offutt has written a couple of hundred books, probably. C.J. Cherryh

14:45.600 --> 14:56.860
produces, I think, probably three books a year. Jack Chalker produces probably
five books a year. Silverberg, when he was writing full-time, produced, Lord

14:56.860 --> 15:09.440
knows how many words a year, one and a half million, two million, something like
this. In terms of productive people, I have a minute output. Well, as a reader,

15:09.640 --> 15:18.200
I sort of lament that fact because I think you're one of the very best writers
around and I would like to see you write a lot more if you'd had the time. In

15:18.200 --> 15:25.560
fact, I feel guilty right now taking your writing time from you. I appreciate
the compliment, but I suspect that if I had more time, I wouldn't write that

15:25.560 --> 15:38.800
much more. I would find other ways of doing things. I probably, if I had half a
day to write, in other words, if I worked half-time at my job instead of full

15:38.800 --> 15:49.920
-time, I would produce more that I might saturate because it would cease to be
enjoyable after doing it for a certain period each day. The definition that

15:49.920 --> 15:59.420
people use of a real writer is somebody who has to write, who will starve if
they can't write and will write even if they have to starve. I don't know if

15:59.420 --> 16:09.380
that makes sense. By those terms, I don't consider I'm a real writer at all
because, although I like to write, it's not the top of my priority of things I

16:09.380 --> 16:23.260
want to do. And the scientific work occupies a higher slot. Marion Zimmer Bradley
said that when she had to choose between a marriage and her writing or anything

16:23.260 --> 16:34.180
else and her writing, her writing wins. That it's the most important thing in
her life. I just don't have that much attachment to it. And I think the fact

16:34.180 --> 16:45.580
that I didn't write for so long that I started for no particular reason after
not writing for a long time may be one of the reasons I don't consider I'm a

16:45.580 --> 16:55.680
true writer. I never felt the urge to write when I was young. I never felt that
fiction was something I had to do. But many writers have that and it dominates

16:55.680 --> 16:56.320
their lives.

16:59.080 --> 17:11.820
Okay, I just have a few more here. I'm sort of winding down. Fine. Are you
involved today in conventions and fan communication and so forth? Well, I always

17:13.200 --> 17:22.960
go to Balticon and I always go to Disclave and I always go to Unicon and I
always go to Philcon. They're all easy because they're all within 150 miles of

17:22.960 --> 17:33.620
fear. I don't usually go to conventions that are more distant largely because of
the amount of time they take. I enjoy them very well but it's a time consuming

17:33.620 --> 17:43.260
activity and I run out of time. I don't have enough time to do the things I'd
like to do but I do enjoy convention atmospheres and I like being on panels and

17:43.260 --> 17:53.560
I like talking to readers and I find it all very relaxing and enjoyable but
there's a limit to the amount that I can do. For example, I probably will not

17:53.560 --> 18:07.200
get out to Worldcon which is this weekend because I have a deadline for a non
-fiction piece of work that I feel I want to make. If I were writing full-time I

18:07.200 --> 18:19.500
might get to more conventions but as it is I have to be rather sparing in my
going off and sitting in con suites and drinking beer. Besides the book

18:19.500 --> 18:31.980
Earthwatch and its sequel, what kinds of places take your non-fiction
publications? Well, I just had a lengthy article on remote sensing satellite

18:31.980 --> 18:42.780
systems in a thing called the Interdisciplinary Science Review which was rather
amusing because the article before mine was an article by Arthur Clarke on

18:42.780 --> 18:52.500
telecommunications for the third world and he wrote me a note a couple of weeks
ago and my article came straight after his and he wrote me a little note that

18:52.500 --> 18:58.660
said if you don't stop following me around like this I'm going to call a cop
which is a reference back to The Founders of Paradise and the Way Between the

18:58.660 --> 19:09.920
Worlds but that was a fairly long article I'm doing a book now which will come
out from William Morrow next year on space careers which is how to go about

19:09.920 --> 19:22.580
getting jobs in the space program and that's going to require a lot of time and
it's a case where I couldn't afford to write that book if I didn't have a job or

19:22.580 --> 19:31.900
a writer and writing for a living I couldn't afford to write a book which is
really non-commercial but I'm doing it because I think it's an important book

19:31.900 --> 19:42.300
and that's one of the luxuries of having a job you can afford to write things
that are intrinsically non-commercial I also have to write a paper by the end of

19:42.300 --> 19:51.720
the year a general survey paper of satellite imaging systems for the Journal of
the American Astronautical Society what I'm hoping to do there is to kill two

19:51.720 --> 20:06.300
birds with one stone and use the same paper as an image processing meeting in
Paris in November so I try to just like writers recycle their stories use the

20:06.300 --> 20:18.760
plot twice I think I'm doing the same thing non-fictionally by making a paper
and a talk come from a single written work if I remember correctly your advanced

20:18.760 --> 20:28.140
degree is in theoretical physics how does that relate to the satellite job that
you do does that come naturally from it pretty much what happened is I was

20:28.140 --> 20:33.080
solving problems in physics using computers and

20:34.840 --> 20:47.140
started to solve problems connected with orbit computation using the same
mathematical methods or variations of them that I had been using already in

20:47.140 --> 20:59.840
physics that led me into orbit computation it led me into NASA that led me to be
asked to take a look at the Earth resources program which was just beginning to

20:59.840 --> 21:11.440
see what computational requirements that would have and that led me on into the
Earth sensing satellite business so it's all connected in a rather peculiar but

21:11.440 --> 21:23.640
logical way but there is a chain that you can connect from the physics to the
present activity and it's been somewhat accidental as usual in life at certain

21:23.640 --> 21:35.540
times you meet people who then do other things and involve you in them I find
that happens quite a lot it's like in writing I find that I meet writers and

21:35.540 --> 21:44.040
before I know it I'm writing things that I never expected to write just because
I met them and later on they come back and tell me they're doing a particular

21:44.040 --> 21:53.200
anthology or something and before I know it I'm committed to doing a story the
same sort of thing happens in the scientific work that you build up a chain of

21:53.200 --> 22:04.740
acquaintances that somewhat dictates what you'll do next okay I would assume I
would almost be certain of this but that you are an optimistic person in regard

22:04.740 --> 22:14.100
to man's future his use of his technology and his capacity to save the Earth
from destruction would that be correct? generally speaking so I think everybody

22:14.100 --> 22:22.280
is almost I ran a panel a couple of months ago in which I asked every science
fiction panelist if they were essentially optimistic that we would be able to

22:22.280 --> 22:34.000
solve our problems and when you got down to it they all said yes I feel the same
because I don't think the alternative is productive in other words if you say no

22:34.500 --> 22:45.880
then you're led to conclude you may as well give up if you say yes then you look
for methods for solving the problem if you look for mechanisms as to how to do

22:45.880 --> 22:59.420
it that's much better to me than sitting around and assuming that we're going to
die in pollution and overpopulation I certainly am convinced that we have

22:59.420 --> 23:13.540
problems ahead in the next century but I'm also convinced that we will have
solutions available through our technology and we just have to be ready to apply

23:13.540 --> 23:24.060
them we do have to have an active program for exploring off the earth because
most of the resources available to us happen to be off earth the energy and

23:24.060 --> 23:34.300
material resources of the solar system are much more abundant than we can get by
harnessing what power we have or what minerals we have down here so we have to

23:34.300 --> 23:46.080
do things we're not doing now but given that framework I'm optimistic I'm
optimistic about most things I think and I don't consider for example I could be

23:46.080 --> 24:02.400
a generally pessimistic writer there are some writers I find have a very
consistent down tone to their writing a depressing tone and I find that I don't

24:02.400 --> 24:11.760
like to read that and I don't think that I would like to write it and I think
the reason I don't like to read it or write it is because inside I'm optimistic

24:11.760 --> 24:12.560
about things

24:15.360 --> 24:24.820
ok excellent I'm down to two more now could you just briefly tell me you're
president still I assume of the American Astronautical Society no I'm not I'm

24:24.820 --> 24:36.100
now the past president and I'm on the board of directors but I serve my time
you're only allowed to serve for a limited period so I serve my time but I'm

24:36.100 --> 24:43.040
still on the executive committee which is the central group that runs the
society along with the board of directors and I'm still on the board of

24:43.040 --> 24:52.640
directors and I'm still active in it I was out there last Friday arranging for
the Houston meeting which comes up in October and the Goddard Memorial Symposium

24:52.640 --> 25:02.760
next spring ok my question was going to be though just I'm not familiar with
that what like what the purpose of it is and what it does the society in the

25:02.760 --> 25:16.360
broad sense the objective of the American Astronautical Society is to promote
the space program and in particular the American space program and to work on

25:16.360 --> 25:28.480
its behalf and argue to the public to Congress to anyone else that it's a good
thing to have it's a society that has picked its members somewhat carefully I

25:28.480 --> 25:41.300
feel for example on the board of directors of the society James Beggs who is the
present national administrator is a director Harrison Schmidt who is the

25:41.300 --> 25:51.880
astronaut and the senator from New Mexico and head of the senate space
activities is on the board of directors Ron Flipper who is the head of the space

25:51.880 --> 26:02.740
application subcommittee on the house side is one of the directors Don Pukwe who
is the head of the science technology committee is on the board we have a lot of

26:02.740 --> 26:18.480
people who are vice presidents or presidents of aerospace activities and it's a
group of people who believe that the space program is important because of the

26:18.480 --> 26:29.220
way in which it relates to the country's overall science and technology
development I happen to regard the technology of the country at the moment as

26:29.220 --> 26:41.100
somewhat in the doldrums I think that US technology and US science has taken a
licking over the past few years but I feel that it is important to the economy I

26:41.100 --> 26:51.100
think if you're technology groups you have recessions and your economy goes
downhill I feel that the space program is a very good stimulant for that economy

26:51.100 --> 27:00.500
as well as holding out these longer term potentials for solving really bad
problems at the end of this century and early in the next century and the AAS

27:00.500 --> 27:12.960
the American Astronautical Society generally has these goals which is in favor
of science in favor of technology and promoting where possible I don't mean

27:12.960 --> 27:22.560
lobbying because we don't lobby but promoting the space program through
technical activities through technical meetings and science fairs this type of

27:22.560 --> 27:33.620
thing okay my last question would you've sort of alluded to these things
scattered throughout the interview but could you draw together for me the things

27:33.620 --> 27:45.780
you're writing on now and your future plans for fiction right well what I'm
writing right now is the book called Man on Earth which is about artificial

27:45.780 --> 27:57.040
earth sensing satellites and there's more pictures and text describing what man
is doing to the Earth and on the Earth cities dams land reclamation this type of

27:57.040 --> 28:08.720
thing that will be finished by the middle of October and will come out next
spring then I'm writing a book on space careers with a lady called Carol Rosen

28:08.720 --> 28:17.380
who has worked a lot on space movement activities that will be finished in
February and will probably come out about the middle of next year and I'm

28:17.380 --> 28:25.240
writing a book called the McAndrew Chronicles which is really more that I'm
writing the last story of a series of stories most of which have already been

28:25.240 --> 28:37.060
published in Analog or galaxy about a physicist called McAndrew that I expect to
be out again next spring and when those are finished I can get back to something

28:37.060 --> 28:51.840
that I started and got about 60 pages done and then other things intruded it's a
hard science fiction novel called Between the Strokes of Night which is quite

28:51.840 --> 29:04.260
ambitious in terms of the scale that it takes place on it begins about 1990 and
it goes out to about 26,000 AD but it does so through a peculiar technique in

29:04.260 --> 29:15.600
which I have different groups of people who live at different subjective rates
in other words they discover techniques in which you can remain alert but you

29:15.600 --> 29:26.840
subjectively time passes very very slowly and in order for that to be done it's
necessary that people must live in a low gravity environment because otherwise

29:26.840 --> 29:38.400
they cannot react quickly enough to external stimuli they would fall over before
they knew it and that novel which it will be will probably occupy me most of

29:38.400 --> 29:47.120
next year when I've got these other things done and I will keep on writing short
stories I suppose just as when I can but I never know quite when I'll write one

29:47.120 --> 29:59.240
of those I'll probably write a story for an anthology that Susan Schwartz is
going to do called Habitats but I haven't started to sit down and write it well

29:59.240 --> 30:08.220
you can I hope you'll accept a request from me to do some more Erasmus Magister
stories I'll do my best yes it's interesting one of the things I have to do is

30:08.220 --> 30:19.120
find out how people react to those generally I don't know yet but I'm glad to
hear that you like them that's a good sign ok listen before we shut this down is

30:19.120 --> 30:29.140
there anything you have by way of crusades or pet peeves or anything you'd like
to say or get on the air no I don't think so I think I'm generally as you said

30:29.140 --> 30:42.460
earlier optimistic and I'm not particularly grieved with most things around me I
have things I don't like but I like to work for the causes I approve of and

30:42.460 --> 30:56.040
against the causes I disapprove of and one of the things that I've noticed is
that it's more effective to go and do things for causes you like or against

30:56.040 --> 31:05.360
causes you dislike than talk about your likes and dislikes so put me down as a
generally relatively cheerful person I don't have a large number of pet thieves

31:05.360 --> 31:15.240
and I don't have any real chips on my shoulder a lot of my friends at the moment
are very upset about the publishing business for instance and I consider it to

31:15.240 --> 31:21.160
be chaotically organized but I think that will take care of itself that's just
evolution at work

31:23.840 --> 31:31.200
okay Dr. Sheffield you've been very gracious to us giving us this much time I
understand how busy you are and we really appreciate it well I hope you get

31:31.200 --> 31:39.660
something usable we will what we will do now we have a lead time of about six to
eight weeks before these get on the air so when we've got them edited we will

31:39.660 --> 31:47.820
send you copies okay and if I can find out the we don't know exactly what
stations will have us in the fall but when I find out if you're interested I can

31:47.820 --> 31:56.740
send you a list of those in case there's one in your area yeah I would be
interested okay we will look forward to your future work and we thank you very

31:56.740 --> 32:05.940
much for your time okay thank you and I'll go and I'll go and write something
okay I've got my Apple computer on over in the corner but I all right Apple

32:05.940 --> 32:10.280
computer all right okay thank you sir bye
