WEBVTT

00:32.040 --> 00:33.980
I'm not with the level of...

00:37.540 --> 00:40.040
They don't have the air conditioning, I think they do.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.680
I was going to give them one hand and one hand.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.320
This is a birthday, not just because I got lucky in the war,

00:48.760 --> 00:52.240
but because I've been upstaying in this room for a moment.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.720
I feel like I was just going to play.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.100
I see that guy, I see him on the wash table.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.100
And I remember all the horrible things we made together.

01:03.740 --> 01:06.140
I had to cut him in the clean, I used to come up.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.520
He's got a regular, he's a young, young, older man.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.740
He was married, she was everywhere.

01:12.340 --> 01:16.760
Old Roger Carroll, who came over and had a ride with God,

01:16.900 --> 01:17.740
loved by the scene.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.920
And I said, Bob, I'm going to be there.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.240
I was in the floor.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.940
They really, really had the time.

01:29.140 --> 01:29.780
They really had the time.

01:29.960 --> 01:35.180
The day, when I was deciding what I am now,

01:35.340 --> 01:36.680
I was the quieter about it.

01:40.540 --> 01:41.760
Now, to start with,

01:42.080 --> 01:44.960
there's a movie in charge of the movie.

01:45.620 --> 01:46.400
I'll give a movie to you.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.980
That night, the Shakira was through a homeless bash,

01:52.560 --> 01:53.940
I guess it might be that.

01:54.020 --> 01:56.480
They came in on the plane from Monterrey, California.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.640
I went to the head store.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.260
Monterrey, that was my description.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.380
And there was a movie about a man.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.060
There was a very extremely heavy,

02:09.240 --> 02:11.460
but a film had sweared, and no T-shirt.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.060
And I felt grumpy and awful.

02:13.060 --> 02:16.460
It was like 197 degrees in this town last night.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.000
And he said, I walked in, like the film,

02:19.100 --> 02:20.600
felt in the air all over me.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.120
I hear that breeze, you know.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.180
And he said,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.520
I'm going to talk about dancing with all that stuff.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.340
That's the one, yeah.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.140
The one with the right shirt to me.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.520
So, they brought me to the party.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.060
And we kind of all popped off on a couple of nights.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.040
Where I was wondering, I'm going to put a shirt.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.240
My mother used to be in town.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.060
And that's how I was wandering around with my hair,

02:44.140 --> 02:44.980
maybe chips, dropping.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.120
Didn't do me a good anyway.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.240
I was one of my sisters in the ladies' party,

02:52.580 --> 02:55.860
and I was giving my name to stuff my teeth in the building.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.220
And I was one to watch her knock.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.380
So, with my shirt, I was filming her food.

03:03.020 --> 03:03.660
Because I thought, right,

03:03.780 --> 03:06.940
out of the back of my head, he came home and sponsored me.

03:06.940 --> 03:10.580
We found Roger there now, in the ladies' party.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.440
We were driving back from the restaurant

03:14.440 --> 03:15.740
where I had bad cold news.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.520
And we were talking about something,

03:18.600 --> 03:21.240
about silver that was safe about me

03:21.240 --> 03:23.760
in relation to a fan, a science fiction fan.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.160
And called me to chamber the novelist with a fan.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.560
And the one that he called the novelist was a kind of a snail.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.980
And that has to cover a thin shelf,

03:34.480 --> 03:36.960
little rooms in which it lives for a while.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.960
But it was out of the next room, the next room, the next room.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.440
When he runs out of rooms, the words get shoved inside.

03:41.940 --> 03:45.860
It was a pretty good room, and he was passed, wasn't it?

03:45.980 --> 03:49.540
And he thought so much as he was talking to his mom and father,

03:49.680 --> 03:51.460
and said, you're a kind of chambered novelist.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.800
But he carried a pass with a new fan,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.360
and he said, no one's here.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.580
I just moved four years old now.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.960
And we are really not hiding from our fellas.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.120
And all of these guys who were sitting in this room

04:04.600 --> 04:05.540
knew me as a friend.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.780
But I don't think any of them, even though they liked me,

04:08.160 --> 04:08.880
got in a drive.

04:10.140 --> 04:13.260
Not as I would, and it wasn't a thing.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.320
I don't think they ever really suspected that I might have some talent.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.440
That I might be able to do something that would last.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.160
Now I could all be hooked up,

04:25.800 --> 04:28.060
and some of you may even have read what or took them.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.200
One of the folks.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.480
And the new book, which I'm going to be talking about,

04:36.220 --> 04:37.960
very popular, and this is too on repeat.

04:38.180 --> 04:38.620
Very comfortable.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.400
They got a jacket and a guy, and they were like, I really do.

04:41.440 --> 04:41.900
It's true. It gets here.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.940
Everybody's going to say, I'm trying to read it.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.020
Any age, you might hear the name.

04:46.540 --> 04:46.700
Yeah.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.440
This new book, I just came out of loving nothing but sex,

04:51.560 --> 04:53.520
and this fellow, a little power is back there.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.200
He got 10,000 copies of this,

04:55.200 --> 04:57.720
and he was selling for a large sum of money.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.440
I've been doing enormous amounts of radio and TV,

05:02.440 --> 05:03.540
and he's been working on this.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.300
I did a Joe Pine show a couple nights ago,

05:06.500 --> 05:07.300
about a week ago.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.000
Actually, I got a particularly swiney, Tom Southern.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.400
Joe Pine is in the hospital, right?

05:12.660 --> 05:13.520
He's got cancer.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.660
Cancer called the room.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.300
There is a God.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.460
And on the product, he moved it up,

05:22.460 --> 05:24.460
but some, you know, in the audience,

05:24.780 --> 05:27.460
the actual time was, and he said, oh, he's just fine.

05:28.340 --> 05:29.900
Today, he was discharged from the hospital.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.040
I said, yeah, this is honorable.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.820
He watched it for that show.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.200
Tomorrow, we'll show a feed up on Dougan,

05:39.340 --> 05:40.020
a feed up on the audience,

05:40.900 --> 05:42.600
and a full meal of all the boys to swine

05:42.600 --> 05:44.280
who would have been in the arena 2000 years ago.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.120
There's thumbs down.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.900
I hated that a lot.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.720
And one day, there was a time, they started talking to me about my hair,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.880
and I said, come on, don't get studied more on it.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.040
And I talked to him about the length of my hair, the toe side,

05:54.200 --> 05:56.320
where George W. W. Robert used to come on his solo.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.420
I mean, he had a long hair.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.420
He had short hair.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.080
He was a monster.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.500
And George Washington had short hair.

06:01.620 --> 06:01.840
Long hair.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.780
I thought that was the one.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.580
But I got very excited about that.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.380
One of the things that's been happening to me

06:08.380 --> 06:09.540
in all of these interviews,

06:10.660 --> 06:13.480
on the interviews where the interviewer hasn't even read the book

06:13.480 --> 06:15.120
instead of reading the blurb and the jacket,

06:15.280 --> 06:16.780
I'm loving nothing but sex itself.

06:17.220 --> 06:17.760
You know, you're right.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.100
That's very crap, right?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.520
We remember responses, always, when Jerry Craft is back.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.520
Well, you know, that's very kind of what I have to read the book.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.740
No, I know Jerry Craft.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.560
I only go on the shows more.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.740
I think I'm going to tell you that.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.640
But the people who have been doing the publishing interviews with me,

06:36.720 --> 06:41.460
who have been reading the book, have found a tone in the story,

06:41.680 --> 06:44.240
which I guess has been in my work house for a number of years,

06:44.460 --> 06:46.460
and I've been a little disturbed about it

06:46.460 --> 06:48.000
because I now recognize it's there.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.260
And I never did before.

06:49.540 --> 06:54.880
It's a tone of violence, a tone of downbeat.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.880
You know, in fact, I had a letter from

06:58.180 --> 07:00.360
Julian Benjamin at the Galaxy Magazine saying,

07:00.520 --> 07:01.620
would you do us a funny story?

07:02.240 --> 07:04.040
You know, I know you can't do a funny story,

07:04.100 --> 07:06.200
but let's try and see if you can do a funny story.

07:08.400 --> 07:13.540
Most of my stories are generally having a tone of moral and ethical duty.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.580
And I want to deal with that at some point.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.160
I have to afford it all.

07:21.940 --> 07:26.580
However, I'm going to do this talk in a kind of a strange and wonderful way

07:26.580 --> 07:28.300
given I love the two beautiful weeks.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.900
I'm going to read some stories and go on.

07:46.920 --> 07:52.460
I have three good stories you'll have in a few weeks. I'm trying highlight what I'm talking about in my work.
Basically, all I've got is

08:03.820 --> 08:09.160
Like I said in that book.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.380
What has been new in the occasion of my American Spring?

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
These are my dreams.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.060
These are where I met my stories and what I have to do to them

08:19.060 --> 08:21.640
if they miss and I'm going to say it's true.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.860
So I was talking to Joe Pines.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.980
Joe Pines' story I did was about Joe Pines.

08:28.620 --> 08:34.260
Because he is one of the most powerless, the most distasteful, the obvious human being

08:34.260 --> 08:36.000
the world has ever known.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.040
He is a swine.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.980
He is the king of the Philistines.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.660
He feels that every base is totally ill-mannered and illegal.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.880
He helps to generate the fears and bigotries of all of us.

08:48.740 --> 08:52.080
And so I wrote a story about him.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.420
And it's called The Teddy Crazy Show.

08:55.540 --> 09:00.800
And you probably can't see it, but the title is like exclamation marks all the way through.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.060
It's like exclamation marks on all sides.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.460
And this story is a funny story.

09:07.820 --> 09:11.440
And I want to read it for you so that I can then get on to some of this stuff.

09:11.540 --> 09:14.720
Because this is the type of conversation that they've been talking about my time.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.680
It's called The Teddy Crazy Show.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.420
This has to publish here.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.600
The first one is about to hit his past story.

09:21.980 --> 09:22.580
He's going to love it.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.380
How it's done!

09:26.020 --> 09:27.040
Joe, let me bring you this.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.120
Thank you. I don't care.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.580
I'm sorry, why don't you get some people and I'll just kind of jack up.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.240
What are you all going to do to hear the sonata story?

09:46.960 --> 09:47.220
Come on.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.760
I don't want to come up with enough things.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.160
Let's stretch that thing.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.060
I'm going to say a Rick Holden story.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.460
You get to this one.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.160
Sitting right there, the man with the camera, he didn't say anything.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.080
He was one of the first people to say Rick Holden.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.460
Now I was not aware of who Rick Holden was at the convention last year.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.080
And then I saw this cat playing everywhere.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.540
I couldn't go to the bathroom without this guy.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.240
It was in my arm.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.460
Every time I was with this cat, he would sit in my face every time.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.300
Finally, I kind of nutcored.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.520
Who is that?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.180
He's a fan of Joe.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.780
He's a good guy.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.140
He's a man of Joe.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.880
He buys all the magazines.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.900
He used to come up with autographs.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.760
I never know if someone said Joe Ardach had an autograph.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.720
But anyhow, so that's what he said to me.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.740
He was Rick Holden.

10:46.740 --> 10:47.460
He was in the army.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.100
He really picked Joe Ardach as a good kid.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.280
Why did he say hello?

10:52.520 --> 10:54.100
I was kind of irrickly on him.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.960
I never know what to say to him.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.360
He's a good guy.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.360
He got that brain damage.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.880
This went on for some time at the Alaska convention.

11:05.100 --> 11:05.880
Rick held his number.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.800
Then I got a letter from people saying,

11:08.020 --> 11:09.820
Rick Holden really needs your stuff.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.080
Can he send you some magazines to be autographed?

11:13.080 --> 11:14.580
So much McNannam's stuff.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.540
Sure, let's see.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.420
He couldn't be back to the military.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.780
He's got a great deal of stuff.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.220
He's got a great deal of stuff.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.140
There's one Washington sign.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.540
Your pin name and your real name on the bill.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.920
And it's also on the first date of the story.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.060
And the hard-knocker's going to marry Jane's girlfriend of mine.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.140
And it's always been kind of weird.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.140
So one thing about...

11:38.140 --> 11:39.480
How long ago was it? About a month ago?

11:39.480 --> 11:39.720
About a month ago?

11:42.400 --> 11:43.200
It's well...

11:43.660 --> 11:44.660
What? May?

11:45.460 --> 11:46.760
It's 12th of May, right?

11:46.980 --> 11:47.240
No.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.400
I got a house in LA.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.280
I'm a bit of a mom.

11:50.480 --> 11:50.940
I'm a little oldie.

11:51.260 --> 11:53.020
So I don't even want to go closer.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.560
That's where I'm at.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.560
This particular day, the editor of FM and Fine Arts Magazine,

11:59.780 --> 12:00.720
is trying to back me up.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.060
He brought his wife.

12:02.820 --> 12:03.780
So the two of you are there.

12:03.780 --> 12:05.060
They can deal with his wife.

12:05.320 --> 12:05.820
They can do anything.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.760
They can have any deal with her.

12:08.940 --> 12:11.420
And I'm going to put on a bathrobe to be respectful.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.820
And we're sitting in my office in the house.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.600
And all of a sudden, they leave.

12:16.100 --> 12:16.940
They have to win, though.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.040
What's the matter?

12:18.580 --> 12:20.220
There's a guy creeping through the bushes.

12:23.380 --> 12:23.940
They're going to say,

12:24.060 --> 12:24.560
Do you know where to look?

12:25.560 --> 12:28.160
There's a guy creeping through the bushes.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.640
You know, I look out the window and there's this guy

12:30.640 --> 12:33.320
who's kind of walking around with a gigantic zoom lens.

12:34.780 --> 12:37.600
He's gathering around in my neighbor's shrubbery.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.060
You know, they're like,

12:39.060 --> 12:40.280
Well, maybe they got a visitor.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.740
They got a guest or somebody, maybe the land has stairs.

12:42.940 --> 12:45.060
And there's nothing behind my house that I wouldn't bump.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.800
You know, and there's a brick wall behind my house

12:47.800 --> 12:49.760
that slopes down into this kind of little valley.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.260
It's very much, very nice.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.480
And I ignore it.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.760
You know, and the guy was in an army uniform.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.740
I think, well, you know, he hurts with his TIA.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.880
You know, we kind of ignore it.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.880
We went into the house, you know,

13:02.920 --> 13:03.300
we were talking about the house.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.140
We were talking about wandering around the house.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.500
We happened to wander in my living room.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.100
Now, when my living room looked out on the back in the mountain

13:08.520 --> 13:10.640
and on the side, it was out of my kind of backyard

13:10.640 --> 13:11.900
side garden brick wall.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.500
Now, we go out on the living room

13:14.500 --> 13:17.200
and I look out and here behind this wall,

13:17.740 --> 13:18.020
you see,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.540
you know, I look at nothing but a rattlesnake.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.300
You know, I'm not really rattlesnake.

13:23.940 --> 13:25.240
Big boy, you're going to kill your dad.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.740
Uh, stands this guy

13:27.740 --> 13:29.280
with his gigantic camera.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.320
I don't know how to connect.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.700
Cooking off, which is my house.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.720
Wait, no, this is too much.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.540
Who is this?

13:36.920 --> 13:39.760
So, I go out in the back porch and I say,

13:39.940 --> 13:40.760
you, you're kidding.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.940
And as he approached you,

13:43.240 --> 13:45.260
he ripped him in the mustache the last time I had seen you.

13:45.340 --> 13:46.120
So, I didn't recognize him.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.100
As he came up, I saw the name on the door,

13:48.160 --> 13:49.820
he was like, oh, oh, oh.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.940
I don't know what I'm talking about.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.700
I didn't think about the house, right?

13:56.940 --> 13:58.140
Not thinking either of his wife.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.080
Imagine what's going through their minds.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.820
What's this aluminum calling on a static hundred?

14:03.340 --> 14:04.960
Now, how do I explain this?

14:05.180 --> 14:05.820
Think the deal.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.400
The editor of this lawful serial,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.780
I know about a science fiction fan, right?

14:10.060 --> 14:12.360
About convention. About Rick Holman down there.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.440
So, he came in,

14:14.500 --> 14:16.160
the first thing he did was he took off his shoes.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.660
Why did you take off your shoes, Rick?

14:17.980 --> 14:20.200
I like your carpeting and I want to walk around

14:20.200 --> 14:20.760
and get it.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.800
So, Rick, Rick made a deal with Joe Goodman.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.240
I was like, well, I'm gonna take it.

14:29.460 --> 14:29.640
I'm gonna take it.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.160
I don't like your shorts.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.620
Is everybody in from upstairs to the restroom?

14:34.200 --> 14:34.700
They're all dead.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.380
That was just a little try.

14:37.980 --> 14:38.700
I can't.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.040
I wish you had them with one information.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.780
If you were under a race, no pride.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.880
You'd never see five more criminal fights in your life.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.220
You'd never see five more criminal fights in your life.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.280
The one there is a blue.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.240
The blue girl is a baby from church.

14:55.840 --> 15:03.680
You'll never going to get out of here. If you're getting bored, 
if anyone is getting bored anytime during my speech, then walk out.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.160
Really?

15:05.260 --> 15:07.420
I'm sorry.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.500
This is a story called,

15:13.580 --> 15:14.880
..."The Teddy Crazy Show".

15:45.400 --> 15:50.120
The very one's eyes went to the monitors and the musical teams swelled to the studio and the credits began to roll.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.440
There it is! 11 o'clock! The stage extended in time.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.920
Now today's this minute in time for the petty crazy show.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.660
Jacoby Hightian out, and then you and Jeff Wright, and the Crawlpard Road, but a very crazy show.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.340
It's a really strict ban.

16:02.500 --> 16:07.860
Put him by holding play, then directed by Grant Winston, and then Jacoby came in over one score, and here he is, the Lincoln Power Man.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.000
The man who went back off. The man who gets the set.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.640
The man who pulls the cover, who jumps the hook. The man of the knot.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.980
He came out of the way, and then came to it, and caught himself in the shoulder.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.200
Heady, crazy!

16:17.880 --> 16:20.440
The blonde is getting it. The chipmunks need to be done immediately.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.740
He's trying to put in the bangers.

16:23.680 --> 16:28.580
The fight of it was about being blasted, screamed, and yowled, and whacked,
and whistled, and snarled, and howled.

17:02.200 --> 17:16.800
The man who was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.320
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:20.320 --> 17:20.520
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.540
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:21.540 --> 17:21.600
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:21.600 --> 17:21.620
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:21.620 --> 17:21.920
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.640
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.980
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.560
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:31.580 --> 17:54.580
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:54.580 --> 17:54.740
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.460
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.060
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.820
He was in the middle of the fight, and then he got the set.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.960
I have come here to talk about...

18:00.400 --> 18:02.440
You talk about what we want you to talk about.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.160
Bronco, not so funny, and you're going to be the other one.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.480
The big, the very nice. And you know why, sweetheart.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.600
It was your choice. It was your way.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.700
I'll tell you why. It's because you've just been given a half a million

18:12.700 --> 18:14.240
of the United States and America's taxpayer.

18:14.620 --> 18:15.920
Harder than money to walk in the park,

18:16.020 --> 18:18.660
than to follow some cuckoo-like shit you got in an egg stream one night.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.660
And how that money is spent, money we all work like dross to make.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.000
If you're concerned of the folks, well, tell me every weekday at night

18:24.000 --> 18:25.840
if I'm not the truth about weirdos like you.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.620
So that police are corrupt people, and let me go and run out of that much gold.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.480
That's why I applaud the government, including a winning candidate in the mob.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.080
Now, what do you got to say to yourself, Rob?

18:35.980 --> 18:36.780
That's just so cute.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.340
You're going to stand together out of sight below the desk,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.360
including the lives of the back and forth.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.960
I was going to play with Bronco, but I came in to show I could play about my theory

18:45.960 --> 18:47.780
without the team's one-man appeal.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.660
They created our leader, and his brother, and his confessions.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.280
Oh, now you want to sit in my house, right, Professor?

18:53.660 --> 18:56.000
Where is my producer, Mr. Hobe Queen, standing right there?

18:56.060 --> 18:57.380
Hobe, turn camera number one on, and Queen.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.560
The camera was revolved as the red light went on.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.780
Hobe, stay crazy, yeah?

19:01.300 --> 19:04.400
Did you promise this man some sort of a hearing for honest, constructive questioning?

19:05.080 --> 19:09.200
Hobe Queen, a frightened man whose greatest dream was a renewal pickup at the end of 36 weeks.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.460
Spread his hand without his people even a vessel of comments, and the sugar head stayed crazy.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.920
The camera revolved, and the monitors picked up, and he created the one-sport listening test.

19:17.580 --> 19:20.820
Say, now you're looking at your man who will us pocket a new one.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.720
No, Professor. Now that we've moved you're not only a quack of floor,

19:24.860 --> 19:27.080
but Charlotte's been in probably an inventive of government fun.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.580
We've written a common-guide writing wire, as well.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.160
No, we haven't taken a laugh. That's a good sign of that statement.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.420
My theory is correct.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.620
I am only as you, the audience.

19:36.060 --> 19:39.300
You hate this old woman? You hate this little Hollywood that the month holds?

19:39.580 --> 19:40.380
Let me hear it!

19:40.740 --> 19:43.160
The streets were closed, but they peed against the walls,

19:43.340 --> 19:44.700
and shallered down like broken glass,

19:45.100 --> 19:46.880
and they slashed through the air like shards of steel.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.340
A little Professor Pessler cringed behind the desk.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.080
It was what the law courts called,

19:51.400 --> 19:55.420
where keeps the record for a thing that speaks to itself, non-religion.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.360
There were millions of eyes, Pessler was, that text snapped discredited.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.380
Now, smoke came as the screen died away.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.040
That's what the only not-familiar, Teddy Craven said,

20:05.400 --> 20:09.160
that the uncommon soft was when you used a president's dog when you took a visit to the facility.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.660
No, Professor. Let's talk about your theory.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.980
But Teddy Craven, you were 15 minutes.

20:15.980 --> 20:20.860
One second of this show, the Monarch had sent away so many books of his administration.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.520
And all across America, no, but no, believed that Professor was not an engine-wasted idiot,

20:25.860 --> 20:27.460
that a man gave him too much cheap whiskey.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.680
They created him a taping break for commercials, four of them, or two pimp-axes.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.380
And he had actually agreed that second yet,

20:33.800 --> 20:37.540
that he didn't inspire popular dancers to bring a father-in-law's family and stuff.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.860
In the monstration, no whistles, or one way,

20:40.940 --> 20:42.620
or one way, a round of obitos, and a round of obitos,

20:42.620 --> 20:44.540
and now usually we do it with the Minister's stick.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.080
It's quite tall, almost six feet, wearing white, lean, and patented clothes.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.700
A minister that's reached him from over a plush-box, and wearing long, blonde hair,

20:51.860 --> 20:52.880
through busts, wooden mesh.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.660
But there was an undeniable sweetness about it.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.320
It's like a very close innocent in the face.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.120
Lab-warned into the directness of the lie of both their occupation

21:00.580 --> 21:03.960
and the moron mass of Teddy Craven's war as she watched him death.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.740
The eating-mister's desire and the pain he said.

21:07.360 --> 21:11.560
The eating-mister's desire and the pain he desired.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.340
And so I just dropped back into the simple silence.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.240
It's not for a woman Teddy Craven would play formal words,

21:17.340 --> 21:19.120
give you two blunt pogroms, it's pretty thick.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.580
But apparently he knew something.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.060
What's that supposed to mean? She looked blank.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.220
What it means is that you're exposed to a body bigger than 99th rare.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.080
You mean you're not pulling around with your measurements,

21:29.420 --> 21:31.720
but a drill for the matter is that they're all pumped out with silicone.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.860
That's a dirty lie!

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
Yeah, well, valley into a hole, if you can, I'm agreeing.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.120
Now, this piece of paper, I'm holding in my right hand,

21:39.120 --> 21:43.260
is a small happenings of Dr. Kanichano, but also a plastic surgeon at Beverly Hills.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.360
He's worked on a jolly 70th of last year.

21:45.620 --> 21:47.680
He operated a new, robust expansion of silicone,

21:47.960 --> 21:50.460
and I needed to start a rather significant process of both hands

21:50.460 --> 21:51.640
and ripped down suddenly.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.740
It was a sound, poor, just plop, and then,

21:53.980 --> 21:56.860
but with a protruding eye of millions of Americans in the Great Waste Land,

21:57.380 --> 21:58.440
Mr. Starr was making it away.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.660
How about those, buddy? She demanded in her own.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.620
But all my life, 40s were cut off the area, didn't they?

22:05.640 --> 22:07.140
Well, rather than making it stop.

22:07.140 --> 22:10.800
Mr. Starr was reclosing top of a road by a man with a third road in the audience,

22:11.000 --> 22:11.700
and he started making it.

22:12.020 --> 22:13.600
He's taken a crazy stab at his holding hands,

22:13.680 --> 22:16.500
looking at his column, and though he'd swallowed something that would enrich him.

22:17.340 --> 22:18.540
Ladies and gentlemen, he said,

22:19.220 --> 22:23.840
What you've just seen, under the grossest demonstration of the basic of a female's speech,

22:24.400 --> 22:28.020
in the living demonstration of the unfinished of this woman to retain

22:28.020 --> 22:29.920
the legal mother of a 70th of a children,

22:30.340 --> 22:32.180
I had no left of data on that piece of paper,

22:32.520 --> 22:34.280
is more than a tip on my part of the report,

22:34.280 --> 22:37.740
this woman would act as such a pudliness that a true nation would redeem itself.

22:38.100 --> 22:41.080
I, a gentleman out there, frightened the funeral of her dear law enforcement,

22:41.520 --> 22:44.200
to have those seven small children, the youths and the custody of a woman,

22:44.580 --> 22:46.140
who was even the rest of the honest property.

22:46.620 --> 22:47.980
Excuse us? I'm going to go to the funeral.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.420
It's a pretty good excuse, that statement.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.200
By the time the area three days later,

22:52.360 --> 22:54.740
the representatives of the funeral court had all the way to the day

22:54.740 --> 22:56.540
to take in the disguise of seven children from her.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.240
But they had been happy with their mother,

22:58.540 --> 23:00.560
that she could work endlessly providing her home to them,

23:00.780 --> 23:01.280
meaning no difference.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.240
Any creative that done her job well.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.180
You think a broken couple of corals

23:05.180 --> 23:07.660
needed to start for themselves, the night she shall wear.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.080
But I was only one-third of the 90 minutes

23:10.080 --> 23:10.860
to go out of the penetration.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.780
I had the show for the rest of you to swear to promising novelists,

23:13.840 --> 23:15.220
excuse me, for being a rank one-hunter.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.120
The manufacturer of a new drug, the Port of the Cure Cancer,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.460
that have aroused and insinuated side effects of the drug,

23:20.560 --> 23:22.320
to do something more convenient than familiar with my baby,

23:22.860 --> 23:24.340
and the woman sticking her long, long clothes

23:24.340 --> 23:26.200
by proving to the audience the satisfaction

23:26.200 --> 23:28.860
of the man being sought and then in charge of the asset in the time.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.260
They gave me the show, the nearing event for that night,

23:32.400 --> 23:35.020
to do a bit of typical average people's show.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.240
What kind of people would have called you a show, baby?

23:37.820 --> 23:40.400
And who's our last guest, Rawling, they gave me the act.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.840
Those new answers to my own story.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.040
But there was a flash of light

23:45.040 --> 23:47.340
and a distinct smell of something that should have been watched.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.340
And I was named Rawling,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.380
the pathetic magic whose Prince of Darker was set.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.040
What did it look like?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.180
The long-tailed protruding season looked like a suit,

23:57.180 --> 23:58.460
and as I ain't no winner,

23:58.680 --> 24:00.780
with them flashed and he stopped across from the test.

24:01.220 --> 24:03.980
The golden movement was wounded at the full height of the two-year floor.

24:04.460 --> 24:07.240
His arms were wound like a curled up with the back of the one red hair

24:07.240 --> 24:07.900
that was coming to his head.

24:08.340 --> 24:10.420
His eyes were wound in colds, the figure was black,

24:10.820 --> 24:13.820
and the experiment had taken a start with that crease for a moment.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.760
The fallen angel is your last guest, Mr. Prince of Darker.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.520
And he sees himself holding a black red light

24:20.520 --> 24:24.500
in the long itself and creating a stare for a moment.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.840
Then he sees that he's worn a magic pair of acolytes.

24:28.200 --> 24:28.980
They're not going to change.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.300
I'm not going to use them.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.740
They have won, and the magic may get to the jerk apart of peace

24:33.740 --> 24:35.120
by hornet by tail by sea.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.820
They can turn the magic into a strong tenderess guest.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.300
Well, your majesty,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.540
in the words of the Lord the Illusion,

24:43.160 --> 24:45.700
do what you know the special privilege of your presence here

24:45.700 --> 24:46.520
on my humble show.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.920
To be precise, Mr. Prince,

24:49.080 --> 24:50.540
I give the night off the Illusion.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.340
Oh, what might that be, so you?

24:53.920 --> 24:56.840
A rare delight, a special potion that my lips and the load

24:56.840 --> 24:58.880
of researches are held in the top of your ears.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.420
And might I be accurate in calling it some sort of hallucinogenic crush

25:03.420 --> 25:06.400
to other less fortunate words that I use to delight themselves?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.700
I'm not stretching to be, you know,

25:08.780 --> 25:11.900
you can call it a psychedality, but it's much more ancient

25:11.900 --> 25:12.840
a recipe than that.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.640
Well, I just tried out here.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.460
See, we used to go to your office

25:16.460 --> 25:18.820
and brought out a small piece of paper that looked like lipstick,

25:19.060 --> 25:20.340
paper, and candy, and candy.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.420
And you were careful not to touch it in the sleep.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.320
They created a hell of a temperament.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.280
This is true about a death.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.720
All right, and that's all I know.

25:26.880 --> 25:27.360
This is not true.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.520
Let's find out exactly what age you're trying to come up

25:29.520 --> 25:31.700
with that death while you've been saying shenanigans.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.400
I'm not trying to throw anything, Mr. Prince.

25:34.540 --> 25:37.400
You're very rewarding for your unsteady service.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.700
Now, you're trying to say, I know from you

25:39.700 --> 25:41.720
that you're a Jew from the other.

25:42.380 --> 25:46.100
I'm confident that you both visit Essence, Mr. Prince.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.060
It's like fate.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.800
You want to make movies to make it so.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.480
I'm very wise and wonder not to eat whatever it is

25:51.480 --> 25:52.780
that the God would cease to eat.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.360
You should burly introduce the very under-menuse films,

25:55.400 --> 25:55.800
I recall.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.360
Any crazy movies for it.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.100
All right, forget the philosophy, Creve.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.200
Just sock it to the leak.

26:00.400 --> 26:00.520
Great.

26:01.160 --> 26:01.960
Satan, not a thing.

26:02.140 --> 26:02.980
Fine, fine.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.660
I don't have too much time to waste doing anything.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.100
The point is, Mr. Creve,

26:06.540 --> 26:08.500
the many of the people you sent me to this show,

26:08.920 --> 26:10.220
the most recently-a-professor,

26:10.280 --> 26:12.100
Tess and I, Mr. Steyer, Mr. Morgue,

26:12.140 --> 26:13.200
and two others just tonight,

26:13.700 --> 26:15.380
you're not reading for long with my operation.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.060
They discredit, discredit,

26:17.060 --> 26:18.340
and make you feel free to go on our show.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
And so that's one of the most

26:20.360 --> 26:22.300
common conditions in my life to suffer.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.300
It's plain habit with property values.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.000
It's really even made a little of these good folks.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.400
It seems the only way to get things back on board

26:28.400 --> 26:30.380
is to even feel it's a reward for what you've done

26:30.380 --> 26:31.220
and putting into order.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.260
Just to remove the lack of support.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.200
That's what you create to train your body.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.580
Can you folks see what this lady is saying?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.380
They just say that they didn't laugh.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.520
Well, if I'm a shark, Mr. Creve,

26:41.580 --> 26:43.120
you know you should have no fear about crimes

26:43.120 --> 26:44.960
when a fortune is soaked into the power paper.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.580
Well, that's just rough, Steyer.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.080
You don't even think I'm going to drop action

26:48.080 --> 26:49.900
right here in front of a couple of 5 million people

26:49.900 --> 26:50.760
just to give you your job.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.000
You think I'm going to lose my precious bottle of glue

26:53.000 --> 26:54.660
just to give you a chance to push whatever

26:54.660 --> 26:55.560
medium that's on it.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.600
And from the school it's only to help us folks

26:57.600 --> 26:58.900
who want something to lighten up burdens.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.280
No chance. No damn chance, as you said.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.100
Well, I don't think you have no choice.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.340
You didn't say that.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.040
You said it.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.260
You haven't seen your eyes like tomorrow.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.200
You didn't laugh enough.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.400
How about it, folks?

27:08.600 --> 27:09.780
Steyer, you've heard those folks in the tribe

27:09.780 --> 27:10.600
and just there and they're like,

27:10.600 --> 27:12.220
do you believe this marines and devil?

27:12.580 --> 27:14.100
Do you believe what he said he is?

27:14.240 --> 27:15.700
The audience can't scream.

27:16.140 --> 27:18.180
The sound goes up and up and all across America,

27:18.380 --> 27:19.900
you live by the millions out of their lucky

27:19.900 --> 27:22.920
and filthy yellows and they believe you are a hysteria.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.320
Even if Teddy Creve is right about the evolution,

27:25.700 --> 27:28.020
let's be the talk that brings obstacles with Marge and you.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.800
They seem wilder than a lot of tone-demand in the devil

27:30.800 --> 27:31.640
to believe that he's a fraud.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.140
But they didn't believe it.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.580
They didn't want to read it.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.180
Even if Teddy Creve turns the stone before they're very eyes.

27:38.100 --> 27:41.380
Anyway, let's see tomorrow when he finally will pile up dust

27:41.380 --> 27:42.980
on his desktop and on the chair.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.920
But it didn't help him visit as much.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.460
Because how did he accept his belief

27:47.460 --> 27:48.460
that he's dissolution?

27:49.060 --> 27:50.040
Is that what he's not accepted?

27:50.340 --> 27:50.720
Was he rejected?

27:51.320 --> 27:52.580
Teddy Creve was dust.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.340
But he visited a man who was quite bad.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.860
Never be heard from him.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.720
There were readers later that month out of the Vatican

28:00.720 --> 28:03.200
and there was a terrific hour struggle going on downstairs

28:03.200 --> 28:04.360
in the discussion of the vaccine.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.000
He said that because it was going to be a while,

28:06.360 --> 28:07.860
he's going to have a really really big deal.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.720
This was the day.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.940
Teddy Creve was designed to do in the world's two big papers.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.020
He got the highest rating of the figures.

28:19.380 --> 28:26.240
he has no real sense of the word.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.100
I agree.

28:27.880 --> 28:28.440
Now,

28:30.480 --> 28:31.320
I'll just say.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.040
down the world, there is a hand.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.400
Well, I was the exception, so it's not a happy moment.

29:10.380 --> 29:14.660
But Joe Pines, who stands for the simple and the kind

29:15.460 --> 29:18.460
that I'm saying that don't have the right to be a man,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.040
I don't even know if it's the audience.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.340
Like Joe Pines, the sign of the times,

29:23.520 --> 29:26.920
there's kind of people, kind of people who watch that show,

29:27.100 --> 29:29.360
having been voted for that kind of show.

29:29.880 --> 29:34.360
You choose for that the piece, you choose to steal

29:34.360 --> 29:37.820
a very old meatball and stand around and watch

29:37.820 --> 29:39.940
have the children's and get married and get my students.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.440
These people are all kind of the kind of people.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.820
And I find myself suddenly a position to be a beauty

29:46.820 --> 29:48.980
choir, and I don't much like it.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.260
But maybe I don't much like what's going on around me.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.440
I think, I think they said before,

29:57.440 --> 29:59.380
I think it's true, they're going to make you violence.

30:01.220 --> 30:05.060
How does anybody make a case for putting food in the kitchen?

30:06.020 --> 30:09.060
So if you could come in and have a lunch here,

30:09.140 --> 30:10.180
they'll help you, all right?

30:10.400 --> 30:12.780
You can get your food, you can get your food,

30:12.860 --> 30:13.060
you can get your food, they'll help you out.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.640
You can get your food.

30:17.860 --> 30:19.740
The food you don't put in the bathroom,

30:19.960 --> 30:20.960
the food you don't put in the kitchen,

30:21.020 --> 30:21.820
they'll help you out.

30:22.220 --> 30:22.640
That's it.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.900
The standout, the work of a prostitute.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.680
You don't do it.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.380
You don't see that.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.800
You don't even get a phone call.

30:31.180 --> 30:31.740
You don't see it.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.260
You don't even get a phone call.

30:34.340 --> 30:37.100
You don't get a job that's going to stand out in front of you.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.000
You don't see a call across the public saying,

30:39.400 --> 30:42.800
there is a job between the last four days

30:42.800 --> 30:44.440
you can go out and it's a great amount of change.

30:44.740 --> 30:46.160
But you're not a sixth society.

30:46.620 --> 30:48.540
And the next four days you guys go into the room.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.840
Now, that courtesy,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.660
I think there's something that I've looked at.

30:56.140 --> 30:58.340
I've looked at the actual, you know,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.880
how you can make your associations with the characters.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.660
I think they're under the last five years.

31:03.940 --> 31:06.760
I don't think it's great.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.020
You know, it's just great, right?

31:09.320 --> 31:10.980
You think you're a chair, you're a bottom-tenant,

31:11.160 --> 31:12.520
and not really thinking right.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.960
But you know, how about John,

31:15.100 --> 31:17.400
he's got the best little background role.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.140
And I remember that there was a chair in the locker

31:19.140 --> 31:21.080
where a shimmy shawm and a bender were missing something,

31:21.460 --> 31:22.620
and not really thinking about it,

31:22.660 --> 31:23.940
but being able to develop it.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.100
That's how it worked.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.920
You know, you're so important.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.460
And somebody in the ring knows how to wrap.

31:29.740 --> 31:31.260
We are now where it was the same.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.760
Why would it be the same?

31:33.740 --> 31:35.340
You were the sexier lady in the public.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.640
You were the public figure.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.880
You know, why not chair in the locker

31:38.880 --> 31:40.420
and not write the same number,

31:40.880 --> 31:42.980
but it was a public figure that got down on the street.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.880
Why not text that very young?

31:45.540 --> 31:47.100
You know, people choose

31:47.840 --> 31:49.220
to think about the variation

31:49.220 --> 31:50.720
of not so great guy

31:50.720 --> 31:52.140
and just kill a little sex

31:52.140 --> 31:53.940
and develop a lot of the talent

31:53.940 --> 31:55.100
that's not his best.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.200
But it's very hard to possibly

31:57.200 --> 31:59.640
work the fourth time for this very little audience.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.620
Now, if you're a real senior in the ring,

32:03.720 --> 32:05.040
why do you have something that bothers you?

32:05.140 --> 32:05.580
It's a story.

32:06.580 --> 32:07.020
You know, I said,

32:07.100 --> 32:09.320
you should tell me about that one day.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.420
And this is what I see in life.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.540
He said, why don't you talk about these good things?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.760
And I said, because people are not going to buy

32:15.760 --> 32:17.060
an inspector who has no money on him

32:17.060 --> 32:18.340
and he's never got care on him, period.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.620
That's not what people think.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.820
That's not what people want to be.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.600
He's not going to do a commercial life

32:23.600 --> 32:24.700
and invite what they want to be.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.220
So, I know, I really want to write.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.240
But the things that are important to talk about

32:30.760 --> 32:32.200
are the things that are terrible

32:32.760 --> 32:34.540
because the good things are good care of themselves.

32:36.820 --> 32:37.800
How much responsibility

32:37.800 --> 32:39.480
does it matter how much it is in times?

32:40.520 --> 32:40.800
Well,

32:42.160 --> 32:43.900
I try to put the right of responsibility

32:43.900 --> 32:45.680
in this good self first.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.040
To be honest,

32:47.700 --> 32:48.600
if you do the best job,

32:48.800 --> 32:50.400
you can't help this story, you cannot.

32:50.800 --> 32:51.620
But if you don't have the time,

32:52.200 --> 32:53.620
you have to be good at this times.

32:54.660 --> 32:57.020
That is a really good second possibility

32:57.020 --> 32:59.440
of an institution that we young people have.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.680
It seems to me that a writer,

33:02.300 --> 33:02.920
in our time,

33:04.340 --> 33:05.460
has to work with these people

33:05.460 --> 33:06.160
for the very long time.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.180
Has to be the same people.

33:08.440 --> 33:09.660
Has to be a little game,

33:09.940 --> 33:11.460
a little asking, a little insulting

33:11.940 --> 33:13.420
for example, in a job.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.100
We know that you can't leave.

33:15.880 --> 33:20.200
It's not a way to get into it.

33:20.260 --> 33:21.300
It's not a way to do it.

33:21.620 --> 33:22.660
It's not a way to be insulting.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.220
It's not going to be a way to go

33:25.220 --> 33:26.620
and do anything to get into it.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.920
It's not going to start even close to Castle Pipe.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.720
It's not all of those things that you want.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.200
But whatever the guys around

33:33.620 --> 33:35.500
they're really upsetting about that.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.680
It's probably a good way to do that.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.240
That is not a good tool

33:40.240 --> 33:40.920
in my trade.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.360
I mean, I can't even write a site there.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.200
But I can put a file in the file

33:44.200 --> 33:45.920
that I would like to write a site in the future.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.400
Now, this is what it's adding that word.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.780
It talks about the reasons of violence.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.880
Just kind of by the time you're at the point.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.080
We don't have a relation to these violence.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.460
Because by using a very high level

33:58.460 --> 33:59.060
of information,

33:59.060 --> 34:02.000
we show you that in fact

34:02.000 --> 34:04.520
that was why I wanted to do it.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.280
You know, in the past

34:05.980 --> 34:07.600
the kind of violence we saw

34:07.600 --> 34:08.900
maybe in the jail in the

34:08.900 --> 34:10.520
prime minister of Seligate

34:10.520 --> 34:11.620
but now, in the

34:12.480 --> 34:14.160
New York jail in the United States

34:14.160 --> 34:16.240
it could get the president's money.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.820
But today, each of us

34:18.820 --> 34:20.640
has not pulled out of the common space

34:20.640 --> 34:22.500
and we're caught by a guy.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.700
I'm not the Japanese to fool because I have a guy

34:24.700 --> 34:25.500
I can't do with.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.340
I am a straight four strikes.

34:51.860 --> 34:52.700
I don't have a hand

34:52.760 --> 34:52.880
There are just a few of them.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.520
And I get to write a white copy.

34:54.720 --> 34:54.900
I left it like I want to write.

34:54.900 --> 34:55.080
It was again…

34:55.080 --> 34:55.100
I don't want them to feel enamored

34:55.840 --> 34:59.500
I chose it to be a conscious.

35:01.060 --> 35:03.620
I didn't realize it when I started writing these kind of stories.

35:04.780 --> 35:10.760
I think about 1960, I wasn't really writing anything that really defined anything before I started training here.

35:10.980 --> 35:19.020
So since 1960 I've been very, very involved in a lot of kinds of social ways, like the civilized human nature,

35:21.780 --> 35:25.100
and my time is the strength of it.

35:25.300 --> 35:30.380
And I think it's my opportunity personally to write the kind of stories in which there was no awareness.

35:31.640 --> 35:37.100
You see, not a happy ending. I don't care if one of you will ever walk into the sunset. I don't care the day.

35:37.900 --> 35:41.180
What I care about is that when you hear a word in one of my stories you say,

35:41.820 --> 35:45.140
wow, I never really thought about it that way before.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.480
And if I had to tell you I'd like to read you another story about that.

35:51.860 --> 35:54.340
Is there anybody from Britain who's been living in the North by the way?

35:55.360 --> 35:55.480
No.

35:56.060 --> 35:56.520
From Britain?

35:57.100 --> 35:57.360
No.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.000
I'm not from Britain.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.420
I'm from the United States.

36:02.000 --> 36:02.780
I'm from the United States.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.020
I'm from the United States.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.820
I'm from the United States.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.460
I'm from the United States.

36:06.960 --> 36:07.160
I'm from the United States.

36:08.100 --> 36:08.440
I'm from the United States.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.820
I'm from the United States.

36:10.820 --> 36:11.160
I'm from the United States.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.400
I'm not a leader.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.080
I'm not a leader.

36:13.880 --> 36:14.520
I'm a shmuck.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.420
I'm not a good leader.

36:16.220 --> 36:17.540
I'm not an artist.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.960
I'm just trying to speak about that.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.680
I know the problem you're going through.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.300
I can't think of why.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.340
I think it's a fun idea to work at.

36:25.520 --> 36:30.600
I know in my book that brass is cool, and brass won't push you back.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.840
Well, sometimes, death can not survive death.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.160
Sometimes death can be not.

36:36.540 --> 36:37.520
We talk about it all the time.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.040
We talk about it really.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.560
It's not just something wrong.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.520
I can't think of a way to...

36:42.520 --> 36:44.180
And I couldn't tell you about it yet, but I did.

36:44.220 --> 36:48.600
So I wrote this story called Shattered at the Blast Goblin.

36:49.460 --> 36:53.860
And the particular story of the B.A. in the night's morning collection the next day came up.

36:55.000 --> 37:02.620
And all I could say about this is that I wrote this and then I went to some literature books that I've written.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.560
I've written a book that I've been hating.

37:04.560 --> 37:08.740
And one of the books that I've written was a book that I really like.

37:10.740 --> 37:12.560
I only wrote this story.

37:16.860 --> 37:17.940
So it was there.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.600
It was later.

37:19.880 --> 37:24.780
And really, finally, we got to put you under the house of a lesbian at the Los Angeles.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.420
It was then, I was not just a child, but a father.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.920
It was a good memory of Los Angeles.

37:31.420 --> 37:35.980
You know, some time in five or four years you'll go abroad and that's always near the sun.

37:36.780 --> 37:42.480
Here at the sidewalk it stopped in front of a place which was a gathered place with a very hacked cut.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.720
And the last breath of one person would see you in a long unfinished walk.

37:46.260 --> 37:50.720
The last cut was in a picture in just the operation of the two of the nine apartment houses

37:50.720 --> 37:53.240
over the square structure on either side.

38:04.860 --> 38:20.620
The other day, the old man was in the house, and he was in the house.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.220
He was in the house, and he was in the house.

38:23.220 --> 38:48.680
I was in the house, and I was in the house.

38:54.760 --> 39:18.480
I was in the house, and I was in the house.

39:18.480 --> 39:48.460
The other day, I was in the front door, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up

39:48.460 --> 40:17.220
at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked up at the sun, and I looked at the sun, and I looked up at the sun,straight, and I looked up at the sun,

40:17.820 --> 40:21.220
When you touch down the side of his heart, going twice the size of his chest,

40:21.560 --> 40:23.660
and it's so deathly you'll reach for the top of it,

40:23.900 --> 40:25.200
Chris, please,

40:26.220 --> 40:28.420
he turned her head away with the hand that he was threatening about,

40:28.540 --> 40:29.760
and she sat him up with him again.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.160
For reason,

40:32.280 --> 40:35.440
when Chris wanted for his stomach to be completely uncoordinated,

40:35.680 --> 40:37.440
he pleaded with Chris, several opt for his life,

40:37.960 --> 40:39.120
and on a passageway in the field,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.200
but when he was about to turn and look out to the closet floor,

40:42.380 --> 40:43.560
I had a presence he was hearing on,

40:44.120 --> 40:45.300
there was no sign that he knew.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.920
Chris was trying to fall back in front of the closet,

40:49.140 --> 40:50.240
she was trying to smile,

40:50.920 --> 40:53.880
and turned back on hands and knees from the closet after her.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.540
Then a rabbit just stood there endlessly,

40:57.060 --> 40:58.400
and he was crushing the rabbit,

40:59.200 --> 40:59.760
and he looked down,

40:59.920 --> 41:02.940
and he was lying in a soft matted fur coat with the pink rabbit.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.640
He looked out the window and just made sure he had no heart at the closet,

41:05.980 --> 41:07.180
she looked at him and he was disgusted.

41:07.820 --> 41:08.960
He looked at her and she changed her way.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.560
I'm not going to argue with Chris,

41:12.560 --> 41:13.380
he said,

41:13.520 --> 41:15.420
but if I were a local,

41:15.960 --> 41:17.920
I might as well come back, please, please.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.840
She would not listen to the voice of the lady,

41:21.260 --> 41:22.720
and look at the closet, close her eyes.

41:23.260 --> 41:24.640
There was no cell in front of her,

41:24.880 --> 41:26.440
and she was trying to recall what it was that I already spoke of,

41:26.620 --> 41:27.460
but there was no sign.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.540
And he was sitting there outside the other door,

41:29.620 --> 41:32.140
and the closet was suddenly a wave coming back to him.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.500
He could wait a few months before they come back to him,

41:34.680 --> 41:36.380
since he made a bucket of chicken to eat,

41:36.460 --> 41:38.820
and he looked at the front of the woman, German, at the house.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.180
There was a smoke,

41:41.840 --> 41:43.120
and it seemed like a ton of blood,

41:43.300 --> 41:44.700
and it was a black shadow,

41:45.140 --> 41:47.380
but the top side of the stairs was empty for a moment.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.720
She looked at the black side,

41:49.880 --> 41:50.720
and it was a cold shower,

41:51.500 --> 41:52.600
and it was too late,

41:52.660 --> 41:55.080
and I thought I'd be leaving you in the morning.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.080
Close her eyes and stare at him with this face.

41:58.900 --> 42:00.320
Why didn't you come here?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.360
Because you're not married!

42:03.180 --> 42:04.220
You're not married, Chris.

42:04.580 --> 42:05.380
I love you, Chris.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.680
Ladies, you should take out that.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.580
The day you heard that was me and to him.

42:09.740 --> 42:11.540
He had out of the closet. Slowly.

42:13.460 --> 42:15.060
Joe was down in the living room.

42:16.660 --> 42:19.760
The downed girl who answered the door was trying to get his pants off him.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.340
He kept shaking his head down,

42:21.420 --> 42:23.360
trying to find her off with a needle-lister hand.

42:23.860 --> 42:25.760
The record player on the living door bookshelf

42:25.760 --> 42:27.160
was playing Simon and Garfield,

42:27.360 --> 42:28.940
with a big, bright green, tiny machine.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.120
Melting, Joe said gently,

42:33.060 --> 42:35.780
Melting, when he finished with a big, foggy mirror

42:35.780 --> 42:36.980
over the fireplace manor,

42:36.980 --> 42:39.820
the fireplace was crammed with unburning wax milk cartons,

42:39.900 --> 42:42.340
candy bar wrappers, newspapers from the underground press,

42:42.480 --> 42:45.080
and tea with the door open and chilled.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.200
Melting!

42:46.360 --> 42:48.080
Joe and he all of a sudden, he covered his eyes.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.300
Oh, shit, Blond girl,

42:49.380 --> 42:50.880
setting through and now getting up and laughing.

42:51.380 --> 42:52.260
She came for a hootie.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.140
What's wrong with him, Lydia?

42:54.500 --> 42:55.780
He's pretty nodding at Chris.

42:55.820 --> 42:56.880
What a drag he could be.

42:57.460 --> 42:59.120
Yeah, but what's happening to him?

42:59.500 --> 43:00.980
He's showing, we see this face melting.

43:01.240 --> 43:01.680
That's what he said.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.560
Is he on Mel-a-Wanna?

43:05.340 --> 43:07.120
Blond girl, to me, was such a good girl.

43:07.600 --> 43:07.960
No, no.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.420
Who are you?

43:10.380 --> 43:11.660
I'm a friend of Chris's.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.200
Blond girl, I saved her from one of the boys.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.600
I had a way her shoulder dropped to the top to relax.

43:16.780 --> 43:17.260
She accept it.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.320
I thought you may have just walked in, you know,

43:19.360 --> 43:19.920
made me the law.

43:20.260 --> 43:22.920
You know, there was a new earthquake on the law,

43:23.080 --> 43:25.440
a high-level earthquake in a long-space swamp

43:25.440 --> 43:26.780
where the sun caught it every morning.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.180
He looked around uneasily, and he didn't know what to do.

43:30.160 --> 43:31.580
I was supposed to marry Chris.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.400
That's not eight months ago, he said.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.660
You know, in this building, it's a long road.

43:36.360 --> 43:37.460
When John and Chris, he turns off,

43:37.540 --> 43:39.160
I can drink a cold co-op more than an all day,

43:39.220 --> 43:39.740
and I'm really worried.

43:40.340 --> 43:41.920
Another record dropped out of the turn table,

43:42.320 --> 43:43.620
and the loose kid, he wondered, blew a heart,

43:43.680 --> 43:44.960
and his harmonica started singing,

43:44.960 --> 43:45.820
having more than one.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.420
I was engaged with Chris when he said to me,

43:48.600 --> 43:50.640
he said, we're going to be married when I got out of the basement,

43:50.820 --> 43:52.120
but she decided to come over and deal with John.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.680
And I didn't want to push her, so I waited eight months.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.880
But I'm out of the army now.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.980
We'll be doing it, we'll go to you.

44:00.300 --> 44:03.460
Under the dynamic age, she put a snap of photo on it,

44:03.480 --> 44:05.700
and it said, Superhero, and I had to call to New York.

44:06.460 --> 44:07.580
When he went back into the living room,

44:07.940 --> 44:09.320
Joe was sitting up on the sofa, reading,

44:09.460 --> 44:10.580
and he cast his magic spell on me.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.480
And he said, Joe looked up,

44:13.720 --> 44:15.020
and took him awhile to recognize me,

44:15.360 --> 44:18.360
when he did pass the sofa, decided to read a game set down.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.360
Hey, who's the way to sit?

44:21.080 --> 44:21.940
I'm in the army.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.460
Wow, heavy.

44:23.960 --> 44:24.760
Yeah, it was awful.

44:25.320 --> 44:26.360
You are now, you're good.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.000
I'm from medical.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.180
Hey, that's good.

44:29.860 --> 44:31.080
It's that quiet that you go out,

44:31.480 --> 44:33.160
and Joe started to nod and said to himself,

44:33.580 --> 44:34.320
you're not very mad.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.800
And he said, Joe, listen, what the story of this great,

44:38.040 --> 44:40.160
we were supposed to get married about a month ago.

44:40.860 --> 44:43.700
Well, she's about someplace, Joe, and I'm a patient.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.140
In the dining room where one girl is sleeping,

44:46.340 --> 44:47.120
naked, under the table,

44:47.500 --> 44:49.660
she was kind of something wild, carrying a knee.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.360
It went on for a long time,

44:51.520 --> 44:53.060
but we were looking out the front window,

44:53.420 --> 44:54.600
the main window.

44:55.020 --> 44:56.300
There was a man in the third place,

44:56.300 --> 44:58.900
standing, talking to two policemen on the sidewalk at the end,

44:58.940 --> 45:00.420
and the front walker leading up to the front door.

45:01.220 --> 45:02.680
Joe, if you're pissed on the way out,

45:03.260 --> 45:04.780
Joe looked at you and said, hey, look at the man,

45:04.940 --> 45:05.960
nobody's keeping him here.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.060
He was moving along.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.220
She liked to go out to the side, go by me.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.580
But you got to walk him up to the front door.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.500
We got up and went to answer the doorbell.

45:13.980 --> 45:15.720
They smiled at him, and we started on the uniform.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.880
Then he held you in his hands, and the first cop said,

45:19.300 --> 45:19.800
do you live here?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.920
Yes, and there'd be my name as you know, Michael, may I help you?

45:23.380 --> 45:25.120
Well, we'd like to come inside and talk to you.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.760
Do you have a search warrant?

45:27.540 --> 45:28.440
We don't want to search.

45:28.560 --> 45:29.540
We only want to talk to you.

45:29.980 --> 45:30.580
Are you in here?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.060
Just this job, I can understand my family.

45:33.660 --> 45:34.460
Well, can we come in?

45:34.840 --> 45:35.220
No, sir.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.820
The second cop looked trouble.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.840
Is this the place they called the hill?

45:39.640 --> 45:40.000
Who?

45:40.400 --> 45:41.560
Nobody asked, what was the place?

45:42.300 --> 45:44.080
Well, the neighbor said this was the hill,

45:44.220 --> 45:45.940
and there was a pretty wild party going on here.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.700
Can you hear any party?

45:48.340 --> 45:49.220
The cop's looking at you.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.280
Nobody at it.

45:50.420 --> 45:51.760
It's always very quiet here.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.320
My mother has died in cancer and stomach.

45:55.040 --> 45:58.700
They let the moon move in because the moon was able to hop to the deep,

45:58.820 --> 45:59.880
the door in the outside.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.480
The sci-commoody went out to the crew,

46:02.620 --> 46:04.200
and the weakens fit to the other side of the line.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.600
No one left the hill, but the new crew was very quiet.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.520
Except sometimes the moon sounded growling in the back hall,

46:11.620 --> 46:12.840
leading up to what it could have made through,

46:13.360 --> 46:16.380
and splashing in the face of the sound of wet things and bricks.

46:17.300 --> 46:18.860
The Mesopotamian Game Room universe,

46:19.120 --> 46:20.880
ordered on the north by acid and mesoam,

46:21.120 --> 46:22.380
on the south by top of Hyode,

46:22.380 --> 46:24.120
on the east by speeding red balls,

46:24.240 --> 46:25.720
and on the west by down to the east by...

46:25.720 --> 46:27.540
There were a lot of people living in the hill.

46:28.300 --> 46:29.240
Eleven and three.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.100
He walked through the hall.

46:31.620 --> 46:32.520
Sometimes Donald Trump,

46:32.660 --> 46:33.560
and he did not talk to him,

46:33.700 --> 46:33.840
he said,

46:33.980 --> 46:35.160
''Once, what you asked him,

46:35.180 --> 46:37.980
''he never did anything heavy behind anything except the rope.''

46:37.980 --> 46:39.080
He didn't know what to answer,

46:39.220 --> 46:40.660
but he was saying that the tree,

46:41.500 --> 46:42.420
the color of the grid,

46:42.560 --> 46:43.660
had walked off to the cellar,

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
and he needed to go over to the attic.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.040
Many of her queens were in the attic.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.220
They sounded like the shrieking of mice

46:49.220 --> 46:50.160
in the corner of the street.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.440
But there were bad things happening.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.840
He didn't know why he was there,

46:54.980 --> 46:57.300
except that he didn't understand why she wanted to stay.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.540
He said, ''All these birds.''

46:59.540 --> 47:00.440
And he sometimes felt that

47:00.440 --> 47:01.980
if you just say the right thing the right way,

47:02.220 --> 47:03.380
Chris would come away with it.

47:03.740 --> 47:05.380
He began to dislike the life,

47:05.860 --> 47:06.640
because he died.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.440
The only talk to anyone else very much,

47:09.500 --> 47:11.020
there was always a struggle to keep high,

47:11.220 --> 47:12.100
to keep his room high,

47:12.220 --> 47:13.160
as elevated and possible,

47:13.600 --> 47:14.940
in that way they cared for each other.

47:15.540 --> 47:17.460
And really became the one link with the outside.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.420
When he'd written to someone, his parents,

47:19.560 --> 47:20.500
and printed the bank somewhere,

47:20.960 --> 47:22.100
and now there was money coming in.

47:22.540 --> 47:24.420
Not much, but he left the kids a blue stock

47:24.420 --> 47:25.200
in the rent aid.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.320
But he insisted Chris be nice to them.

47:27.740 --> 47:29.300
They all made her be nice to them,

47:29.480 --> 47:30.900
and she slept with them in the little room

47:30.900 --> 47:31.600
in the second floor

47:31.600 --> 47:33.660
where Rudy had put his newspapers in his double bag.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.320
He laid there most of the day,

47:35.520 --> 47:37.160
when he was not out on errands for the hills,

47:37.500 --> 47:38.540
and he read the smaller items

47:38.540 --> 47:40.840
about train wrecks and molestations in the suburbs.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.320
And Chris came to him and they made love of the sword.

47:44.420 --> 47:45.720
And one night she convinced him

47:45.720 --> 47:47.580
that he should have made it heavy behind acid.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.220
And he let the paper dissolve in his throat,

47:50.560 --> 47:52.000
and she was stretched out like a cat

47:52.000 --> 47:53.040
and for six miles.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.920
He was a fine copper wire

47:54.920 --> 47:56.040
charged with electricity,

47:56.240 --> 47:57.000
and he kissed her flesh.

47:57.340 --> 47:59.100
She ran towards the current that flowed through him,

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
and he knew softer yet.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.100
He sank down into the softness

48:02.100 --> 48:02.900
and carefully ensured

48:02.900 --> 48:04.140
he could do three effects

48:04.140 --> 48:05.120
her tear drops made

48:05.120 --> 48:06.900
as they rose in the midst around it.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.560
He was down and getting slowly,

48:08.660 --> 48:09.540
turning and turning,

48:09.880 --> 48:11.060
held by a whisper of blue,

48:11.220 --> 48:12.860
it came out of his body like a spider web.

48:13.220 --> 48:14.240
The sound of her breathing,

48:14.240 --> 48:16.120
the moist, crisp, with killer cavity

48:16.120 --> 48:17.220
that went down and down

48:17.220 --> 48:19.400
was the sound of the very walls of his cell.

48:19.700 --> 48:20.760
And when he touched it with his

48:20.760 --> 48:21.640
long, bare-foot finger,

48:21.760 --> 48:23.220
she drew in breath heavily,

48:23.420 --> 48:24.880
working the air up around him

48:24.880 --> 48:25.740
as he sank down,

48:26.040 --> 48:28.680
putting slowly in the veil of musty uselessness.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.260
There was an insistent pulse

48:30.260 --> 48:32.180
and it was somewhere allotted.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.340
And he was afraid of it.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.100
As he descended, the high-pitched whining

48:35.100 --> 48:36.400
of something threatening to shatter

48:36.400 --> 48:38.480
and felt panic, panic, drifting,

48:38.940 --> 48:40.580
wayward, and still constricted.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.900
He tried to grasp the veil

48:41.900 --> 48:42.320
on the toilet,

48:42.560 --> 48:43.580
and his hands were in his blood,

48:43.580 --> 48:46.220
faster now, much faster in a rage, in a rage.

48:46.580 --> 48:47.920
Violent explosion going on

48:47.920 --> 48:49.540
in the shrieking of something that wanted him,

48:49.680 --> 48:50.460
that was seeking him,

48:50.680 --> 48:52.140
hulking deeply in the drawer of an animal

48:52.140 --> 48:52.820
he would not name.

48:53.060 --> 48:53.800
And he heard her shouting,

48:54.060 --> 48:55.420
heard her roar, and pitched beneath him,

48:55.600 --> 48:56.960
and it felt a crushing feeling.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.980
And there was silence.

48:59.920 --> 49:00.980
There lasted two of them.

49:02.260 --> 49:04.300
There was soft music in the man's mouth

49:04.300 --> 49:05.220
and blood in the kitchen.

49:06.380 --> 49:07.740
So they laid their foot together

49:07.740 --> 49:08.720
and they gave him the pain.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.380
And he slept for some hours.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.520
After that, really so,

49:14.620 --> 49:15.460
that we're out of here in the light,

49:16.200 --> 49:17.180
he didn't shot me at night,

49:17.200 --> 49:17.720
we're in shape.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.460
He emptied the garbage at night

49:19.460 --> 49:20.460
and swept down the front door.

49:20.620 --> 49:21.360
He walked in the front door,

49:21.460 --> 49:22.960
and he was sitting there for a long while,

49:23.060 --> 49:24.860
with a noise that registered him on an higher level.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.480
He went along in a great way,

49:26.620 --> 49:27.740
because when he stole the sound,

49:28.000 --> 49:29.020
he fell all through the door.

49:29.620 --> 49:30.500
He began to realize,

49:30.640 --> 49:32.480
he had not seen some of the other young people

49:32.480 --> 49:33.980
who lived in the door for a long time.

49:34.580 --> 49:35.860
But the sound was from above,

49:36.480 --> 49:38.400
and below, and around him in the house

49:38.400 --> 49:39.360
and room more frequently.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.120
His clothes were too large for him now.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.380
He wore only the underpants.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.260
His hands and feet hurt,

49:45.580 --> 49:48.100
but he looked like his fingers were larger than crackling them.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.680
There were always an angry prison.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.580
His hand always burned.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.860
The same perpetual odor of weed

49:53.860 --> 49:56.220
was saturated in the wood wall and the rafters.

49:56.440 --> 49:57.980
He had an itch on the outside of his ear

49:57.980 --> 49:58.740
and he could not well.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.620
He made newspapers all the time.

50:00.920 --> 50:01.600
Old newspapers,

50:01.800 --> 50:03.260
his items were embedded in his memory.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.600
He remembered a job he once held

50:05.600 --> 50:06.520
in the garage of the police,

50:06.520 --> 50:08.380
but that seemed a very long time ago.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.320
When they'd come off the electricity in the mill,

50:11.820 --> 50:13.000
he didn't bother to do that,

50:13.100 --> 50:14.500
because he preferred the dark.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.900
But he went to tell the other one,

50:18.300 --> 50:19.240
who could not find it.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.060
They were all gone.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.420
He'd be crisp,

50:22.980 --> 50:23.980
and surely a thing there somewhere.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.680
He heard the voice of the sound from the basement

50:26.680 --> 50:28.960
and went down with foreign silence in the darkness.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.740
The basement of his blood.

50:31.280 --> 50:33.360
One of the 11 names heading was there.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.840
He was attached to the sign

50:34.840 --> 50:36.340
and told it up the wall of the basement,

50:36.820 --> 50:37.900
hanging close to the stone,

50:38.280 --> 50:40.860
holding softly and getting off the thin green light.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.900
He dropped a rubbery arm into the water

50:42.900 --> 50:43.680
and let it hang there,

50:43.740 --> 50:45.360
moving either in the eye or the thigh.

50:45.800 --> 50:46.660
Then something came there

50:46.660 --> 50:47.680
and he made a shock movement

50:47.680 --> 50:49.000
and broke a thing up still wide.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.020
He made rubbery brick and itched it up the wall

50:51.020 --> 50:52.860
with a dark, moody spot and his upper surface.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.500
He had a bandage that covered his length

50:54.500 --> 50:56.380
and pushed the thing in the dark blood spot,

50:56.420 --> 50:57.820
where it shrieked with a terrible sound

50:57.820 --> 50:59.500
and he knew that there was a sucking noise

50:59.500 --> 51:00.420
in his swallowings.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.620
He ruined my back upstairs.

51:03.260 --> 51:06.120
On the first floor, he found the one who was the blonde girl

51:06.120 --> 51:07.240
whose name was Abraham.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.220
She lay out in and wiped the table cloth

51:10.220 --> 51:11.280
on the dining room table.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.180
The three of the others he had not seen

51:13.180 --> 51:14.080
in a very long while,

51:14.220 --> 51:15.460
put their teeth into her.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.140
They threw their hollow shark teeth.

51:17.500 --> 51:18.660
They drank up the yellow fluid

51:18.660 --> 51:19.800
in the globetust pot

51:19.800 --> 51:21.380
as they think of rest in the cutout.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.580
Their faces were very white in their eyes,

51:23.700 --> 51:24.540
like a sick tongue.

51:25.460 --> 51:26.620
Climbing to the second floor,

51:26.760 --> 51:27.800
Louis was almost knocked down

51:27.800 --> 51:29.580
by the passage of something that had been picked up

51:29.580 --> 51:31.660
flying an heavily-ripped leather weight

51:31.660 --> 51:33.500
in the very attic of his jaw.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.420
He found Chris in the attic

51:35.420 --> 51:36.960
in a corner breaking his skull

51:36.960 --> 51:38.540
and sucking out the moist brain

51:38.540 --> 51:39.720
that looked in the table cloth.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.680
Chris was left to go away,

51:42.800 --> 51:45.040
but he reached out and crushed him,

51:45.520 --> 51:48.460
snapping for a long, pointless, dirty fingernails against him.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.640
He ran like crystal.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.540
In the rafters of the attic,

51:52.700 --> 51:54.340
Jonah Crouch garbled and screamed,

51:54.700 --> 51:56.180
there was a green stain on his jaw

51:56.180 --> 51:57.700
and something stringy in his claw.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.140
Chris, please, tell her to wait.

52:00.640 --> 52:01.460
His head was bruised.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.440
His hair is itched.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.260
Chris sucked out the last of the middle of his fingers

52:05.260 --> 52:06.860
and the skull of the siloed little creature

52:06.860 --> 52:08.820
and scraped highly at the plastic bottle

52:08.820 --> 52:09.680
with hairy hands.

52:10.100 --> 52:11.240
She stumbled back on her heart.

52:11.300 --> 52:13.520
She said, her long, hairy muzzle pulled up.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.240
Louis scuttled away.

52:15.900 --> 52:16.440
He ran low.

52:16.780 --> 52:18.240
There's nothing rushing the attic floor.

52:18.360 --> 52:19.140
He scampered the safety.

52:19.500 --> 52:20.820
Behind him, Chris was growling.

52:21.160 --> 52:22.260
He got down to the second floor

52:22.260 --> 52:23.060
and ended the first

52:23.060 --> 52:24.920
and tried to climb up on the Morris chair in the mantle.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.360
So he could see himself in the mirror,

52:26.360 --> 52:29.080
in the light from the moon through the fly-blown window.

52:29.460 --> 52:30.540
But Naomi was on the window,

52:30.620 --> 52:32.040
wrapping up the fly with a tongue.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.620
He cried with desperation, wanting to see himself.

52:34.980 --> 52:36.540
And when he stood before the mirror,

52:36.880 --> 52:38.140
he saw that he was transparent,

52:38.480 --> 52:39.780
that there was nothing inside him,

52:39.940 --> 52:41.180
that his ears had grown pointed

52:41.180 --> 52:42.500
and had hair on their hips.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.580
His eyes were as huge as a prashear

52:44.580 --> 52:46.080
and a reflection of light burning.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.180
Then he heard the growling behind him,

52:48.260 --> 52:48.580
lowing.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.080
The little glass got a little turned

52:51.480 --> 52:53.680
and the world rose up on its high legs

52:53.680 --> 52:55.120
and touched him till he rang

52:55.120 --> 52:56.500
like a flying crystal.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.140
And the werewolf said with very little concern,

52:59.760 --> 53:02.740
have you ever grew heavy behind anything except the bottle?

53:03.580 --> 53:05.900
Please, the little glass got on its head

53:05.900 --> 53:08.100
just as the gray hairy paw swatting

53:08.100 --> 53:10.600
in one million-class eighty-way-n-mall fragments,

53:10.880 --> 53:12.900
all expanding consciously into the pipe,

53:13.220 --> 53:14.820
a really cold universe that was a hill,

53:15.120 --> 53:17.280
all buzzing, highly-contacted and inly,

53:17.480 --> 53:19.120
walked into a darkness that began

53:19.120 --> 53:21.200
to seep out through the silence.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.440
What a draw.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.000
Thank you.

53:33.420 --> 53:35.860
I think I had gone on far too long already,

53:35.940 --> 53:37.740
so I will make a quick summary of it.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.720
A writer from a show on

53:40.720 --> 53:44.720
writes just a book or just a play

53:44.720 --> 53:46.520
or even one quatrain at a time.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.760
What he's doing is he's making a journey through life

53:49.760 --> 53:50.620
and recording it.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.400
And what he's saying in his time is,

53:52.400 --> 53:54.420
this is where I think I am at this time,

53:54.540 --> 53:56.500
and this is what this place looks like to me.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.700
It seems to me that a writer,

53:59.160 --> 54:00.400
to be of any value at all,

54:00.860 --> 54:01.660
not only for himself,

54:03.080 --> 54:04.780
but to hostility and to his times,

54:05.720 --> 54:07.600
must write up his times and up himself.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.500
Must write up particular fears of a sale of him,

54:11.040 --> 54:12.620
even as they are reflected in the things

54:12.620 --> 54:13.820
around him that he sees.

54:15.060 --> 54:16.960
What I've tried to do and I'll realize

54:16.960 --> 54:18.560
and what I've said in a little booklet

54:18.560 --> 54:19.580
about these are my dreams,

54:19.580 --> 54:22.860
is I've tried to put all of my dreams down,

54:23.140 --> 54:24.840
so that maybe just for once

54:24.840 --> 54:26.240
you can look out of other eyes

54:26.240 --> 54:27.240
and wonder them your own.

54:27.540 --> 54:29.460
We all see out of our own special eyes,

54:29.880 --> 54:32.100
and even if I can have the eye of yours,

54:32.340 --> 54:33.100
you can't see out of mine,

54:33.200 --> 54:34.440
unless I'm looking at my story.

54:35.220 --> 54:38.180
And for the family to join my story,

54:38.420 --> 54:39.260
you can't use the word.

54:39.900 --> 54:42.300
And so we exchange our easy-to-use stories tonight.

54:42.620 --> 54:43.260
Thank you.

54:49.580 --> 54:50.880
you
