00:01.080 --> 00:05.760
Okay, I'd like to start with your, the latest series, You Finish the Demon Princes.

00:07.500 --> 00:14.120
It amazed me that you could expand the theme, what seems to be a slight theme, into five

00:14.120 --> 00:14.940
beautiful novels.

00:16.380 --> 00:19.960
Do you remember what began the first book, The Star King, and did...

00:19.960 --> 00:24.580
Well, my theory on this, I mean, I have to forgive me if I kind of ramble a little bit

00:24.580 --> 00:29.300
on it, because I haven't really put into words too much.

00:29.500 --> 00:37.560
But in general, I think when you're plotting something in this order, you don't want to

00:37.560 --> 00:38.340
get too involved.

00:38.620 --> 00:44.340
Just take some rather simple idea, which is susceptible of a lot of variation, you see.

00:45.020 --> 00:49.840
If I started something with a real complicated idea, and then try to make five books about

00:49.840 --> 00:57.160
it, I'd be catching my feet all the time, getting an idea which is essentially rather

00:57.160 --> 01:04.540
simple, and then diversifying as I go along, it simplifies it for me.

01:04.740 --> 01:08.380
Now, I don't think that's anything particularly...

01:08.380 --> 01:12.820
So, the complication, or anybody who figured it out for themselves.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.500
So, naturally, when I started, I had no idea how it's going to turn out, in other words,

01:21.340 --> 01:21.700
I...

01:21.700 --> 01:23.260
In fact, I don't believe I've...

01:23.800 --> 01:27.420
As I went along from story to story that I even considered being...

01:28.440 --> 01:29.500
Well, I had...

01:29.500 --> 01:34.580
Yes, I had to do that a little bit, come to think of it, because if anybody's ready, you

01:34.580 --> 01:44.760
don't notice that in the epigraphs, the story, I have people kind of discussing the whole

01:44.760 --> 01:48.660
five of these so-called events, and characterizing them.

01:50.520 --> 01:57.600
But, essentially, I really didn't have much notion of what one villain from story to story

01:58.140 --> 02:00.060
kind of had to work it up as I went along.

02:01.320 --> 02:01.800
Period.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.560
Did you intend for there to be five books when you started?

02:05.900 --> 02:06.940
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:07.620 --> 02:18.420
I got the first one to go in, and then through all of the problems in the publication, I

02:18.420 --> 02:23.840
got diverted and didn't get back to doing the final two for all of the...

02:27.020 --> 02:27.900
Did I...

02:27.900 --> 02:33.580
I'm not sure if anybody else saw this, or if I misread it, but I could swear there was

02:33.580 --> 02:34.520
an inconsistency.

02:35.100 --> 02:39.960
In the Star King, you say that the demon princes were aliens, and by the time I get

02:39.960 --> 02:41.400
to the palace of love, they're humans.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
No, the...

02:45.800 --> 02:55.020
This particular breed of individual that was the Star King was a member of this area.

02:55.960 --> 02:56.860
He was...

02:56.860 --> 03:02.680
I really forget, in fact, I had some notion of us to do some more work and develop this

03:02.680 --> 03:03.500
idea a little bit more.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.720
Now, this is an idea...

03:05.720 --> 03:17.380
This was a sort of a creature that had the ability to mimic or simulate human beings,

03:18.180 --> 03:18.760
and it was nature.

03:19.620 --> 03:23.780
But the rest of them were not, just this particular one book there, one.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.500
I think if I were doing it over again, I'd change all that.

03:27.580 --> 03:30.640
I wouldn't have the agents at all, I'd eliminate that whole...

03:30.640 --> 03:32.300
It's not necessary to do them yet.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.340
To the...

03:34.340 --> 03:37.360
A lot of the book really, and it could kind of distract us.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.760
That's the kind of thing that's involved with it.

03:41.860 --> 03:49.080
In other words, it doesn't augment the series at all, I think, to have that personal understanding.

03:49.780 --> 03:50.620
Do you agree or not?

03:51.320 --> 03:52.580
No, I agree with you, yeah.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.440
It doesn't make any difference.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.880
They could have all been human.

03:56.200 --> 03:56.340
Yeah.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.700
I think it would have been more consistent, too.

03:59.620 --> 04:04.020
Now, look, but then, when you're starting a series, you see, you're just...

04:04.020 --> 04:08.540
Ricking here, roping there, trying this, trying that, thing not works.

04:09.600 --> 04:16.440
Then after you kind of get a rhythm going, that's how you do the rest of it.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.640
I felt some sympathy for the demon princes.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.780
They're very creative individuals.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.040
They have a very bad character yourself.

04:28.380 --> 04:28.860
Well...

04:28.860 --> 04:29.860
Are you...

04:31.060 --> 04:32.840
Are you a good church?

04:33.080 --> 04:33.440
You know that?

04:34.320 --> 04:34.800
No.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.660
What I mean is this.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.120
They have enormous talents.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.040
They're very creative.

04:41.780 --> 04:47.060
Some of them were mistreated as children, and they've made it with great success in a large universe.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.180
They don't grow old when Chris Gerson ends their lives.

04:51.080 --> 04:51.640
The...

04:53.900 --> 04:59.160
One of the groups that most fits what you're saying is the last one, the book number five.

05:00.980 --> 05:12.660
The villain in the number three book, he was badly treated as a child, perhaps.

05:14.760 --> 05:23.760
I think the number one, two, and four, really were developed themselves into what the elements

05:23.760 --> 05:24.060
were.

05:26.720 --> 05:33.440
I never felt any particular sympathy for any of them, you know, as liking except a little

05:33.440 --> 05:35.140
bit for the number five.

05:35.780 --> 05:36.740
What a number five.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.520
Why does Gerson say in that last book, I think it was the last page of the book of dreams,

05:42.520 --> 05:45.980
that Alice tells him to throw the book of dreams out into space, and he says, I can't

05:45.980 --> 05:46.400
do that.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.020
Why would he have any sympathy, or why would he have any response to that book such that

05:51.020 --> 05:51.900
he couldn't get rid of it?

05:54.340 --> 05:56.920
Well, I think everybody will have to answer that for themselves.

05:59.100 --> 05:59.480
Okay.

06:01.060 --> 06:06.240
Kurt Gerson himself, in some ways, he's as monomaniacal as the demon princes, you know,

06:06.260 --> 06:07.940
the whole purpose of his life is revenge.

06:08.580 --> 06:13.320
That is essential to the otherwise, that's the gasoline which makes the cargo.

06:15.160 --> 06:15.680
Right?

06:16.180 --> 06:16.320
Right.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.100
Okay.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.640
You mean that's a more?

06:19.840 --> 06:20.360
No.

06:20.600 --> 06:25.880
If he was kind of poem about the old thing, then there wouldn't be any story.

06:26.120 --> 06:26.720
It wouldn't be a theory.

06:28.020 --> 06:34.800
In other words, if he wasn't upset, then he might get bored, you see.

06:35.560 --> 06:42.680
In other words, in order to, for instance, if Napoleon didn't like the idea of conquering

06:42.680 --> 06:46.260
the world, he might have just been farmed grapes and carcasses.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.100
In order to make the stories function, you have to have a person with a certain set of

06:51.100 --> 06:51.480
attributes.

06:53.360 --> 06:53.840
Correct?

06:54.200 --> 06:54.720
Yes, sir.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.260
Do you admire him?

07:04.320 --> 07:17.440
Well, let's, I'm just trying to characterize the question by saying that first to stay

07:17.440 --> 07:25.080
aloof from these, from getting involved in.

07:27.760 --> 07:35.880
What am I trying to say is I prefer to be like a director at a, at a, producing a, working

07:35.880 --> 07:39.500
a movie than to get myself involved in my character.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.640
I want to stay away from it.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.340
I didn't answer your question.

07:46.060 --> 07:46.940
That's good enough.

07:47.240 --> 07:47.380
Yeah.

07:47.940 --> 07:48.300
Okay.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.140
Let me move on just to another topic here.

07:51.320 --> 07:57.200
The, obviously you're, you're noted as a stylist, your distinctive method of writing.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, that's, well, go on, ask your question.

08:00.260 --> 08:03.680
Well, I was just going to say I'm kind of interested in the, the evolution of your style,

08:03.740 --> 08:04.720
because when you began.

08:04.860 --> 08:05.820
It would irritate me.

08:06.040 --> 08:06.940
I don't have any style.

08:07.960 --> 08:12.480
All I do is try to write whatever in the best possible way.

08:13.220 --> 08:20.680
Now, if you take the trouble to read some of my murder mysteries, or you'll find that

08:20.680 --> 08:22.620
they're, they're written in a different way.

08:22.880 --> 08:29.660
Everything, everything you write, everything I write, everything anybody writes, the style

08:29.660 --> 08:34.460
or the way the words are put together is part of the clue to the story.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.060
It is part of the story itself.

08:37.160 --> 08:40.080
It's part of the complete, completed product.

08:40.900 --> 08:45.820
Now, when you say, why did I, how did I evolve this?

08:46.240 --> 08:55.300
That, that implies that I have one style that I use for everything from this early dying

08:55.300 --> 09:06.120
earth thing up to one of all this mystery stories with localum in the countryside out

09:06.120 --> 09:08.040
here called Fox Valley Murders.

09:08.740 --> 09:12.580
If you take the trouble to examine the, the way the words are put together, you find it

09:12.580 --> 09:13.120
totally different.

09:13.500 --> 09:19.260
I'll select that Ronald, which is a sense story, the way that the words go together

09:19.260 --> 09:25.280
or different from the way the words go together and say, oh, I don't know what.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.320
No, I don't have any style.

09:28.120 --> 09:37.300
All I do is have a good, that's a good judgment as to how to, as, as the proper way of putting

09:37.300 --> 09:47.260
words together to generate the proper, not the mood, not, well, generate the proper style

09:47.260 --> 09:49.080
for that to work, evolve.

09:52.200 --> 10:00.520
And to say that I have a style, it doesn't annoy me, not annoy, but here, edit, edit that

10:00.520 --> 10:00.760
up.

10:00.940 --> 10:01.300
Okay.

10:01.580 --> 10:02.600
I'm not annoyed.

10:02.600 --> 10:10.940
I'm just, what I'm trying to say is that I don't think it looks very deep into, into

10:10.940 --> 10:11.360
what I'm doing.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.260
That's a super paraphrase that I do really like.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.180
I don't care.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.540
I don't care what way the other one is.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.940
Well, I didn't mean to imply that everything you wrote was a typical, you know, the same,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.840
the same exact work, but what I, what I sort of meant was that back in the, say in the

10:29.840 --> 10:34.560
late 40s and early 50s, you were, I guess you were writing for the Pult Magazine.

10:34.860 --> 10:35.640
You know, there were no books.

10:35.940 --> 10:36.920
I was learning my trade.

10:37.860 --> 10:43.800
I got started writing, not as, not real young, you know, like some guys did.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.200
In fact, I was doing lots of other things.

10:47.220 --> 10:53.700
And then I decided I was going to be a writer and I started writing and I had all the talents

10:53.700 --> 10:54.940
for it, I guess, apparently.

10:55.700 --> 11:01.880
But I didn't have the knack or the practice or whatever you want to call it of putting

11:01.880 --> 11:02.560
the words together.

11:03.580 --> 11:09.860
And also I was, I was trying to write the wrong kind of story.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.380
Those days, the gadget story was very big.

11:15.080 --> 11:20.940
And I, I, a lot of times I'm trying to write gadget stories on scientific breakthroughs

11:20.940 --> 11:29.840
and things like that, which is essentially kind of a line-down, I think.

11:31.420 --> 11:38.780
And it's a phase of the field which is mercifully going over the hill.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.040
I've got a very good scientific background.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.260
It's not that I don't know science.

11:43.540 --> 11:43.940
I do know it.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.400
I was going to be a physicist, actually, for a while.

11:51.600 --> 11:56.060
I started to count the physicists, but I changed my mind.

11:57.260 --> 12:11.040
So it's, it's been, in the 40s and 50s I was writing and paramedics and collecting rejection slips.

12:11.040 --> 12:23.080
And there was an apprentice period, an apprentice period in which I was paid not very much for it,

12:23.120 --> 12:25.040
but, you know, checked once in a while.

12:26.680 --> 12:31.480
But essentially those 40 and 50 stories, they're not, they're not much good with that work.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.840
I just soon forget, forget them.

12:38.100 --> 12:38.980
That's the way it goes.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.760
How about you? You a writer?

12:41.360 --> 12:45.300
I'm an English teacher. I do some writing, but I teach English here at Odessa College.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.980
So I guess I'm more scholar than I am a writer.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.620
But you understand what I'm saying.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.060
Oh yes, sir, I do. Yes, very well.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.140
I understand you did sell some stories to Campbell.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.260
Oh yeah, I sold to Campbell.

13:04.660 --> 13:09.460
In those days, Campbell was the best market agent of his money.

13:10.180 --> 13:19.500
And I was always happy to sell Campbell, but I was never one of Campbell's co-derees or groups that he was going on.

13:19.500 --> 13:26.900
And I was always on the outside, which now I'm very well suited.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.340
As I say, I think it was a blind alley.

13:32.840 --> 13:37.340
Campbell was in many ways an interesting man.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.000
He had frequent courage.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.620
But I don't think his taste in literature was all that sound.

13:46.920 --> 13:52.940
You know, he was a positive force, a dynamic force for the time.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.500
But when I think back, you know, the whole field of science that you're in,

14:01.680 --> 14:09.520
I think he was probably, oh, give a little bit more credit.

14:09.520 --> 14:15.700
But it's fine, then, maybe we'll see from the perspective of 100 years from now.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.860
That's fine. That's fine. Yes, anyway.

14:20.460 --> 14:20.860
Okay.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.960
My next one would be sort of a two-prong question.

14:26.400 --> 14:32.080
The first prong would be when, you know, when and why did you make the decision to become a professional writer?

14:32.220 --> 14:36.340
And why did you take up science fiction and fantasy rather than some other area of writing?

14:37.620 --> 14:40.880
First, I thought it was the idea of my life.

14:42.460 --> 14:51.000
And I wanted to find some way of making a living where I could travel, be my own boss, for one hour.

14:53.480 --> 14:58.040
And writing this thing, the way that suggests it.

14:59.660 --> 15:09.620
And so I kind of, even when I was a little maybe, 12 years old, I kind of told myself I kind of liked being a writer.

15:10.940 --> 15:16.420
You know, I wrote little stories. I don't even know what happened to it.

15:16.980 --> 15:22.960
I think I said a story of Saturday and told it to a sportsman in South Pacific.

15:22.960 --> 15:29.280
It was from the style of the adventure story 19.

15:30.380 --> 15:34.720
And then we got it back. Then we got a letter from it.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.160
And of course it wasn't good, obviously.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.700
Then I got a sidetrack.

15:44.780 --> 15:53.620
For a while I thought I was going to go into other, what's the quote,

15:56.780 --> 16:01.420
ways to make a living. I can't think of words.

16:02.020 --> 16:07.840
Meaning the ways that you make a living. That's the excuse that occupations make.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.120
And as I say, I started in a, well, the physicist.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.820
And I thought I'd be a mining engineer. I gave that up.

16:19.700 --> 16:25.780
And I intensively decided no, I'm going to be a writer.

16:29.420 --> 16:34.560
And why I chose science fiction, I don't know, or fantasy, whatever you want to call it.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.340
I'd put out as a kid, I've done a lot of reading.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.220
I've done a lot of reading in everything before that.

16:45.180 --> 16:55.220
But I've kind of probably more touched by, or not influenced just the word, influenced, I guess.

16:55.340 --> 17:02.900
You might say by the fantasy and the so-called science fiction.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.540
Rather than by much anything else.

17:05.600 --> 17:11.920
Although I wouldn't have loved to be able to write like Wodex, P.G. Wodex.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.360
I would have been great, but it's obvious there could only be one, one life in the band F7.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.080
And so that particular niche was blocked.

17:23.420 --> 17:27.340
So I guess I decided at least fantasy rather.

17:27.340 --> 17:34.820
I could have written, I wrote murder mysteries and had decent success with them.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.760
I've never tried what is so-called mainstream novel, whatever that means, I don't know.

17:42.940 --> 17:56.300
But it's never had a quite an interest for me to write a book in the field which I guess appeals to the...

17:58.720 --> 18:09.900
Well, this tells me, you know, there is the valley of the dolls or something like that.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.760
I wouldn't know how to start, I guess I could do it.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.580
But I like to write the things I like.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.300
The fact of it is I write the things I want to write.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.640
And these things are the ones I like to write.

18:30.060 --> 18:38.260
And that is the story of why the female science fiction family today is the basic self-indulgence of you.

18:41.360 --> 18:41.960
You there?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.020
Yes, sir, that's fine.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.980
I don't know if you're listening there, or whether you're not there or not.

18:48.340 --> 18:53.540
No, I'm just being careful about budding in because if I should bud in to one of your speeches and it's hard to edit me out.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.900
I just want to make sure that you're done before I start, but I'm listening.

18:57.420 --> 18:57.520
Okay.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.820
Yeah, there's a few people listening here.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.020
I have been following you ever since I started reading science fiction.

19:07.140 --> 19:11.920
You know, you are my favorite author and I think I've read everything you've written, as far as I know.

19:12.700 --> 19:17.640
I have always thought personally, I'm sure you've heard this from other people, that you have lacked recognition.

19:19.060 --> 19:26.840
You know, you're contemporary with people like Asimov and Heinlein and Van Votensturgeon, but perhaps not as well known as they are.

19:27.680 --> 19:32.080
And I wondered why you thought that was, because your science fiction is at least as good, if not better than theirs.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.460
Well, I think I would have probably good by it.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.160
Okay, that's good.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.560
Norman Spinrad wrote an essay on your Dragon Masters, I think, in review of it.

19:47.580 --> 19:55.600
And he said that you were more for a minority taste of reader rather than the mass market.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.980
I wasn't quite sure what he meant by that.

20:00.160 --> 20:00.560
Do you have you?

20:00.560 --> 20:03.220
I don't quite agree with him.

20:03.480 --> 20:16.640
I don't think I write anything that's particularly obscure or pedantic or very highly cultivated.

20:17.380 --> 20:23.360
It seems like everything I write is fairly universal.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.020
Don't you think so yourself?

20:27.020 --> 20:29.000
It doesn't seem like a narrow base.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.000
No, it's not narrow.

20:32.300 --> 20:40.540
But on the other hand, I'm always amazed at the people who consider themselves science fiction readers who have read very little of what you've written, too.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.400
Yeah, well, I don't really know much about it.

20:44.520 --> 20:48.000
I'm long ago given to stop worrying about it.

20:48.140 --> 20:57.460
I just sit at this end of the tube and occasionally drop the manuscript down and then forget it.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.400
I hope that I'll get paid for it.

21:00.160 --> 21:11.140
But if I'm starting to worry about who these people are, or worrying about who the readership was, I think I'd probably go mad, if it were a matter.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.140
It's pointless, I think, to...

21:18.560 --> 21:24.460
I've always, I think, decided that I've always written a thing which amused me correctly.

21:29.340 --> 21:30.460
And the...

21:31.340 --> 21:38.460
I think another thing, too, that I've developed rather gradually in...

21:40.380 --> 21:47.880
reached, by presence, whatever you want to call it, by kind of a back way inconspicuously.

21:48.960 --> 21:53.020
I've never, Clark has known for 2001,

21:53.820 --> 22:00.980
a high-line, stranger-than-strange land or whatever, children's books are, or through Campbell.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.040
And it's...

22:11.040 --> 22:18.480
I've never been associated with anything that had any other publicity attached to it.

22:18.480 --> 22:26.100
So I just seem to arrive on the scene, so it seems to me, if I were looking at my own career in this way,

22:26.800 --> 22:38.020
kind of quietly from northeast somewhere, rather than through having a movie or...

22:38.800 --> 22:41.540
or something that's sort of...

22:41.540 --> 22:43.540
I don't have an explanation, anyway.

22:45.140 --> 22:48.440
Right now, I'm doing a...

22:48.440 --> 22:51.460
Like, I'm just finishing up on a rather... something totally different.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.260
It's a medieval-type fantasy.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.300
It's very long, and so I'm just going over 600 pages on it now.

23:01.180 --> 23:12.320
And it's just possible that this will have more acceptance across a wider spectrum of readers than my other stuff.

23:12.900 --> 23:19.360
Although, as I said at the beginning of this film, here, I really don't understand myself

23:19.360 --> 23:28.200
why I don't track the larger audience.

23:29.120 --> 23:29.980
That was me a little bit.

23:30.760 --> 23:38.720
I was doing something real strange, a writing like James Joyce, you know, or something I can understand it,

23:39.020 --> 23:48.620
but in the right simple set of clues, the subject matter is not all that hard to...

23:52.280 --> 23:52.680
understand.

23:53.040 --> 23:58.480
So, but then, actually, you don't have to forget your name, I'm sorry.

23:59.080 --> 23:59.480
Daryl.

24:00.260 --> 24:00.660
Daryl.

24:00.760 --> 24:00.980
Daryl.

24:00.980 --> 24:03.940
We moved that last... those last two sentences.

24:04.480 --> 24:04.760
Okay.

24:04.980 --> 24:06.080
I don't like the way they sound.

24:06.460 --> 24:07.040
Yeah, that's fine.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.620
You know, for about two, three minutes.

24:09.100 --> 24:17.680
I'm stumbling around talking about why I don't understand what people don't like, and it sounds like I'm kind of whining.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.040
Yeah, no, I'll leave that out.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.900
That's not what I'm trying to say anyway.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.240
Yeah, all right.

24:25.340 --> 24:25.880
What's your next one?

24:26.100 --> 24:28.140
Okay, I want to get back to your work just to move along.

24:29.060 --> 24:33.160
I guess your first book that was published as a book was The Dying Earth around 1950.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.840
Now, that was different than the pulp material.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.000
Yeah.

24:40.220 --> 24:41.580
What caused that kind of change?

24:42.040 --> 24:47.940
Well, the funny thing about it is that was written before I started selling.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.300
I was written in C, as well as Merchant C.

24:52.700 --> 25:03.600
And I didn't have quite a bit of spare time to begin writing these flamboyant, highly colored stories.

25:07.520 --> 25:13.740
And then when I began selling, I think I had these things lying around.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.180
And I kind of forget to tell you the truth, just what happened to them.

25:19.280 --> 25:31.880
But I think I had them sitting around for several years and finally put them together in the way they are now.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.400
And sent them to the agents.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.940
And he told them to go with the bureaucracy.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.480
But those were written all very, very early.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.700
They were written before I even started selling them.

25:46.580 --> 25:56.660
So they're just representative of kind of rather early stage.

25:58.160 --> 26:03.580
And then when I started writing the so-called gadget fiction or other stuff,

26:04.660 --> 26:14.480
I changed the style of this, the dying earth stuff, wasn't at all suitable for writing the stuff I began selling.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.620
That's the stuff I was selling with any of this, because it wasn't.

26:18.920 --> 26:24.240
But at least the style of the dying earth would have been absolutely,

26:27.720 --> 26:32.240
sort of incongruous when the critics tried to use different styles.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.340
You didn't sell the stories individually, did you?

26:36.420 --> 26:38.280
In other words, I, so I didn't.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.260
I was just trying to think about that.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.980
But I don't believe I sold them anywhere.

26:43.300 --> 26:49.400
It seems to me, and may be wrong because it's so long ago,

26:49.400 --> 26:55.220
but it seems to me that the first time I ever sold them was in the group.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.560
I'm almost certain, but I wouldn't swear to them.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.200
In other words, the order is your own order in the book.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.460
Yeah, I used that order.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.300
I turned around the temporal sequence a little bit,

27:08.980 --> 27:15.980
but I did that in order for what I considered to be a little bit more impact.

27:18.840 --> 27:24.140
Yeah, well, rightly alone, I like it better the way it is,

27:24.860 --> 27:27.660
if they were in the exact chronological sequence.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.760
Did you mean for there to be sort of a movement or progression like it?

27:34.000 --> 27:43.100
No, there were conceived of as being vaguely interrelated stories,

27:43.780 --> 27:51.540
but without a strong connecting link.

27:52.340 --> 27:55.280
In fact, the last one was written without any connecting link, whatever,

27:55.520 --> 28:00.300
it just conceived different brains.

28:01.220 --> 28:06.120
And I think it is a little bit different from the rest of it.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.260
Well, I thought that, for instance, that last story,

28:09.360 --> 28:11.820
the first part of the book was very heavily into the magic,

28:11.820 --> 28:14.400
and the last part, the last couple of stories were more science fiction.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.360
Whatever you want to call it, yeah.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.100
Yeah, that's all right.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.140
And I guess it was about 15 years, you didn't write any dying earth material

28:24.140 --> 28:27.040
until you came to the Eyes of the Overworld series.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.020
That's not my title, like somebody else's story.

28:30.220 --> 28:31.680
I know, what was your title? Did you have one?

28:31.840 --> 28:32.940
I think I just called it Cool.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.480
Yeah. Why did you come back to the dying earth?

28:36.600 --> 28:37.340
Did you get reader response?

28:37.760 --> 28:41.900
No. I was just more and more to do some more stuff in there.

28:44.460 --> 28:50.380
And this character was swarming around in my hand.

28:51.700 --> 28:56.480
And I just decided it would be kind of fun to do some coogled stories.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.660
In fact, as soon as I finish, I want to get another volume going,

29:00.860 --> 29:03.960
because I have time to do it after I finish what I'm doing now.

29:03.960 --> 29:08.600
I've got two stories in a second instead of coogled.

29:09.120 --> 29:14.140
I've got a coogled book that I'd like to get another three, four stories

29:14.140 --> 29:15.300
to make another book out of.

29:16.040 --> 29:16.600
Good.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.340
Okay, let me move on again.

29:20.580 --> 29:23.400
I don't know of any other writer who is as convincing as you are

29:23.400 --> 29:27.880
in constructing an alien planet with its cultures and customs and so forth.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.860
One person called you the foremost.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.980
I think she used the word Xenographer in science fiction.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.540
My question would be, when you start a novel about a world,

29:38.700 --> 29:41.600
say Durdain or Tri or something, where do you begin?

29:41.700 --> 29:43.500
Do you begin with a story and then build a world

29:43.500 --> 29:45.920
or begin with the world and get a story or a character?

29:47.200 --> 29:51.980
Well, this is such a complicated process that I'm not even going to answer.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.120
It's part of everything.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.680
It all works together.

29:57.680 --> 30:03.680
It's like, I'm trying to think of an analogy.

30:04.020 --> 30:04.840
I can't think of anything.

30:05.760 --> 30:12.300
But it's just like if you're an architect and you're building a house,

30:13.800 --> 30:18.720
do you put down the foundations first or do you think of people,

30:18.940 --> 30:22.600
how they're going to live or do you envision the landscaper?

30:22.860 --> 30:23.960
In other words, you do it all together.

30:25.740 --> 30:31.480
You don't form stuff in your head as an entity.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.180
Then you see it and that's it.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.080
There it is.

30:37.780 --> 30:38.300
Does that make sense?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.300
Yeah, it does.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.460
You don't really, I guess you wouldn't appreciate

30:43.460 --> 30:47.860
or be able to respond to or to a source kind of a question for a story, would you?

30:48.300 --> 30:50.020
No, I don't have any sources.

30:50.020 --> 30:58.260
But if the question I'll tell you is, if I have a simple answer, I can tell you.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.700
Well, okay, I mean I could get smaller, big on this.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.100
For instance, in the novel Trollian from the Elastra cluster series,

31:06.380 --> 31:08.140
that game Hussade or Hussade?

31:08.280 --> 31:09.020
I call it Hussade.

31:09.300 --> 31:09.720
Hussade?

31:10.100 --> 31:10.520
Hussade.

31:10.700 --> 31:11.780
Hussade, oh good, okay.

31:12.540 --> 31:13.700
So it's no way.

31:13.900 --> 31:14.580
You're not meeting that.

31:15.320 --> 31:15.740
Okay.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.340
What about some of the made evil settings in some of your books?

31:23.900 --> 31:26.080
Like in, say, Inferio, the gill system there.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.460
Oh, I don't know.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.180
Gills.

31:32.040 --> 31:38.800
Well, it's just that it seems that that would be a universal pattern.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.020
I don't think it's made evil.

31:41.020 --> 31:58.840
I think gills are clans, kingdoms, brotherhoods over when you have lots of different societies.

32:00.020 --> 32:08.880
I think these things all form under many, under different guises perhaps.

32:09.320 --> 32:17.160
But there's only so many ways that human beings can join together,

32:17.280 --> 32:20.240
one is through their occupation, one is through their blood relationship,

32:21.240 --> 32:24.300
one is maybe political beliefs.

32:25.220 --> 32:32.980
There's only 10 or 12 different ways, whereas societies and cultures are infinite.

32:34.120 --> 32:42.480
So if there were gills here and there in the future, what would be rather surprising?

32:45.020 --> 32:49.340
Okay, you've mentioned, and I knew beforehand, that you do have a science background.

32:50.500 --> 32:57.820
In most of your books, you set up societies that are really non-technological,

32:58.120 --> 33:04.180
like people work with their hands and so forth, even though man has star drive and space travel and so forth.

33:05.180 --> 33:08.080
I wondered why you didn't spend more time on the scientific.

33:08.080 --> 33:14.640
It's just like when you're writing magic stories, where the magic is in here.

33:16.240 --> 33:25.600
It's rather hard if you have a magician to live with him in such a way that he can't do anything and then there's no story.

33:26.260 --> 33:32.180
When you're writing about a magic to a magician, you have to have it arranged

33:32.180 --> 33:38.660
so that there's some kind of a conflict or a tension involved.

33:39.380 --> 33:44.060
So the same thing, in exactly the same phrases, can be said about science.

33:46.160 --> 33:55.940
If you have scientists who are able to manipulate energy and robot forces and tools,

33:56.700 --> 34:00.480
there's no way they can do anything without leaving their armchair.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.360
So there's no story.

34:05.060 --> 34:10.700
Stories are made by human beings interacting and doing things with their hands,

34:11.440 --> 34:19.660
not by turning laser beams on each other, or even worse, sitting at consoles and pressing buttons.

34:19.820 --> 34:20.400
That's no fun.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.560
We're not no story involved.

34:23.620 --> 34:24.920
What's to read about that?

34:29.620 --> 34:34.280
I think when you think about it, the answer to that is self-evidence.

34:35.540 --> 34:44.380
But perhaps you just haven't asked yourself a question and tried to answer it for yourself because it is almost self-evident reading, right?

34:44.780 --> 34:48.180
That's an excellent answer. That's good. Very good.

34:48.180 --> 34:55.180
I thought it might have been also some sort of a, oh, I don't know, a liking for a simpler, more primitive existence,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.360
a dislike of a plastic technology.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.880
A little bit perhaps.

35:07.740 --> 35:15.420
I tend to be a little suspicious of people that live their life only in terms of abstractions.

35:20.760 --> 35:28.880
In other words, I have more admiration, more respect, more fellow feeling, I think,

35:28.960 --> 35:32.540
for people that live their lives a little closer to the soil.

35:32.840 --> 35:41.620
You know, that there's farmers or seamen or people that are in contact with natural things.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.800
People working in computer factories or something like that.

35:48.820 --> 35:55.320
I suppose maybe when they leave work they go out and raise a garden or something.

35:56.880 --> 36:01.000
Re-establish their contact with the soil.

36:01.400 --> 36:08.400
But hey, don't cut that way.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.920
I'm getting too involved here.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.540
Let's go back a little way.

36:13.780 --> 36:23.020
Just say that I just feel, cut it off where I said that I just feel a little more sympathy with people that have contact with the,

36:23.760 --> 36:26.400
I'm getting too complicated.

36:26.920 --> 36:34.000
If I go around analyzing people's occupations and say whether this is more abstract matter,

36:34.320 --> 36:38.200
it just makes a lot of, it gets too complicated.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.240
Okay, I understand.

36:40.500 --> 36:40.620
Fine.

36:40.860 --> 36:46.380
Okay, let me just ask you a question on the, is it pronounced Chai, the planet Chai?

36:47.120 --> 36:48.200
I usually say Che.

36:48.520 --> 36:48.760
Che?

36:48.920 --> 36:49.540
Makes no difference.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.360
I don't, I'm not sensitive about such things.

36:55.140 --> 37:01.880
Okay, it seemed to me that of all the series you've done, that was, I mean, yeah, okay,

37:01.960 --> 37:05.280
that might have been the one that had sort of an open ending that you could add to it.

37:05.300 --> 37:06.900
Do you plan anything further on Adam Reath?

37:06.900 --> 37:13.520
I thought about it at the time, but I don't think I'd want to go back there.

37:13.740 --> 37:23.400
I think what's better left the way it is, the obvious set of sequels would be expeditions from Earth,

37:24.440 --> 37:32.280
or not Earth, but the, whatever was the system that's landing on there and getting embroiled in the, in the people there.

37:32.280 --> 37:42.400
And I'm not to twid with the idea a little bit, and then I decided no, that would become baffles, that would be, you know,

37:42.560 --> 37:43.780
I just decided it wouldn't work.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.080
I thought, I'll just leave it alone.

37:46.620 --> 37:53.680
The way it was, it was great, everybody left and the, I didn't want to disturb it.

37:54.460 --> 37:55.660
I wanted something else.

37:58.160 --> 38:03.020
Okay, in a number of your books, I'm thinking of the Durdain trilogy principally,

38:03.160 --> 38:08.180
but in a number of them you speak of the Historical Institute, and I have a vague idea of what that is,

38:08.260 --> 38:11.240
but could you sort of fill in some details on what that is?

38:11.320 --> 38:17.580
Your idea of what it is is just exactly as careful and elaborate as mine is.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.980
You know, as much fun as I do.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.420
That's just about the size of it.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.040
I just left it kind of vague.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.680
I just didn't want to go into it too much.

38:25.980 --> 38:26.380
Okay.

38:26.900 --> 38:31.740
If I ever had any reason to, I probably would have fleshed it out a little bit,

38:31.840 --> 38:38.100
but just for the purposes of that book, and on other occasions where I've used it,

38:39.080 --> 38:46.520
I've just left it, just kind of a force off the distance, and let that suffice.

38:48.980 --> 38:49.980
That's the reason for that.

38:50.140 --> 38:51.700
In other words, I just don't know.

38:51.900 --> 38:58.380
I have never worked to death in any company, in that company,

38:58.520 --> 39:02.980
but exact or precise form.

39:04.460 --> 39:09.680
Okay, in the Elastor Cluster series, that almost allows for an infinite number of books.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.920
Do you have any further planned?

39:11.780 --> 39:13.000
It's a matter of time.

39:15.860 --> 39:18.040
As I say, I want to do a kugel.

39:19.920 --> 39:26.060
The thing I'm working on now goes, I've got two or three more in mind.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.120
Now, these are kind of long books.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.640
They're not sword and sorcery.

39:32.200 --> 39:37.760
If anybody's called it sword and sorcery, I might have a fifth.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.180
But it is medieval.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.820
There are swords in it.

39:42.880 --> 39:52.080
There is sorcery, but it's no big muscle bound people wearing jock straps,

39:52.680 --> 39:54.780
cutting people's heads in it.

39:56.400 --> 40:02.100
But anyway, if this goes over, and I hope it will, I'll do some more in the series.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.360
If not, I'll just go along.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.480
I'll figure it out and go along.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.140
Okay, I'm moving right along here.

40:11.120 --> 40:15.860
I've always noted a lack of didacticism in your writing.

40:15.960 --> 40:21.000
Sort of a detached, ironic perspective on people and the human condition.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.060
But sometimes I see some pretty sharp satire criticism.

40:24.960 --> 40:29.400
And usually that's directed against, say, an elite class or a ruling class.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.940
Would that be a fair observation on my part?

40:32.260 --> 40:32.920
No, not necessarily.

40:36.840 --> 40:41.320
Those criticisms, which you may see generally,

40:49.140 --> 40:54.680
well, I don't know, it'd be complicated to try to explain to you my personal ideologies.

40:54.680 --> 41:01.700
But in other words, I think your observation is a little bit off the mark there.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.240
I do have opinions, obviously.

41:07.700 --> 41:14.680
But in general, I try to keep ideology out of the books,

41:14.820 --> 41:19.140
except by remote inference.

41:20.060 --> 41:24.660
Although I have in two books, I got a little bit of ideology in there.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.540
I don't think I'll do it again.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.200
Would one of those be The Great Prince?

41:31.440 --> 41:31.580
Right.

41:32.660 --> 41:33.640
The Great Prince.

41:34.020 --> 41:38.200
The other, I've been accused of it, is Witt, you know, in the Elistor.

41:38.420 --> 41:38.740
Right.

41:39.500 --> 41:46.760
But that doesn't mean any particular, it was satire rather than ideology, I think.

41:47.640 --> 41:50.300
The welfare state wasn't bad, you know, I suppose, too.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.480
But maybe it was laid on a little bit too heavy anise.

41:56.340 --> 42:01.760
Have you ever said to you or spoken to you in terms of the last castle,

42:02.160 --> 42:06.200
that the society you depict there is sort of a brittle, decadent kind of society?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.120
Never once.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.620
No, there's never any complaints there at all.

42:12.860 --> 42:14.180
I wasn't thinking of complaints.

42:14.180 --> 42:17.060
You certainly have a right to your opinions and you have a right to put them in your books.

42:17.960 --> 42:28.760
But generally speaking, I like to keep my opinion so that nobody even knows you're there.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.380
That they only work out through the way things happen.

42:34.620 --> 42:38.460
And if anybody notices, then I feel I haven't done a very skillful,

42:40.600 --> 42:43.980
however the great prince, it was a little bit more overt.

42:46.200 --> 42:50.240
But it wasn't all that.

42:50.680 --> 42:54.220
You know, it wasn't laboring anybody over the head.

42:55.020 --> 43:00.440
Okay, let me just shoot out a couple of miscellaneous questions here.

43:00.920 --> 43:04.580
Do you have any works that you're particularly satisfied with that you,

43:05.660 --> 43:10.380
I don't know what word to use, not favorite so much, but that you're particularly pleased with the way they came out?

43:10.440 --> 43:11.460
I was like, cool.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.120
I'm very happy with that, generally speaking.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.960
I like the Durdain set pretty well.

43:26.180 --> 43:31.840
I generally like most everything I've done over the last 20 years or so.

43:32.760 --> 43:38.920
In fact, I look back at some of the stuff and it scares me.

43:39.200 --> 43:46.600
I just hope that I can keep on writing up to the level of that stuff I knew earlier.

43:48.300 --> 43:51.000
So I try harder.

43:52.600 --> 43:57.440
So I can kind of not feel I'm over the guillotine.

43:57.440 --> 43:58.060
I'm over the guillotine.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.760
I strike that last off.

44:00.920 --> 44:01.400
Okay.

44:02.660 --> 44:05.380
I'll just go back just a little bit.

44:06.900 --> 44:10.300
What's been your biggest moneymaker in the science fiction fantasy field?

44:10.640 --> 44:16.480
Well, I don't know for sure, but I can tell you something is always amusing.

44:17.320 --> 44:26.920
Well, I was first starting, as I mentioned to you, I was trying to decide how to go about making some money in the business.

44:29.560 --> 44:35.120
And I thought I'd try to be one of these guys that writes very, very fast.

44:36.320 --> 44:39.020
You know, I just sit down, put paper in the typewriter.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.700
I write longhand, by the way.

44:40.700 --> 44:46.160
But so one day I went down over the weekend, I was visiting some people.

44:46.900 --> 44:50.460
Over the weekend I wrote two short stories, this first draft.

44:52.200 --> 44:56.020
And I forget now, well, I guess my wife typed them.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.900
And I said them out, both were sold.

45:00.020 --> 45:03.280
And they were the two first Magnus Rydolf stories.

45:04.260 --> 45:06.580
And they appeared in due course.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.860
And they were rotten stories, both of them.

45:10.960 --> 45:19.720
They were just terrible first draft stories I just soon see absolutely forgotten.

45:20.400 --> 45:31.240
Well, I don't know why or how, but a producer in 20th Century Fox noticed this story was called Hard-Luck Dings, I guess.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.440
Rotten stories.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.700
But there was just a sentence there, it caught his mind.

45:36.560 --> 45:41.100
So he picked up the story, paid me for it, well, you know, Hollywood style.

45:41.820 --> 45:45.060
Hired me to come down there to prepare a treat for the movie.

45:46.180 --> 45:51.840
Paid me well to, you know, to do this play for it, Screen Splash.

45:52.420 --> 46:01.900
So that wretched story that I'd done in whatever, it made an awful lot of money.

46:02.740 --> 46:06.700
And yet it was probably one of the worst things I've ever done.

46:09.480 --> 46:17.060
In terms of more dignified methods of making money, I don't know, I'll tell you the truth.

46:17.060 --> 46:29.840
I used to keep a record of burning stories by the tenth, you know, or how they worked outside.

46:30.580 --> 46:39.120
Other words, other words, whether it means so many words, somebody said the word or so much dollars or thousands of dollars or whatever.

46:39.120 --> 47:00.180
And but over the years, what was foreign sales and resale in this scene became meaningless because the going to inflation and the way money changed,

47:00.760 --> 47:06.280
I'd be getting paid five times as much for, hello?

47:06.800 --> 47:07.180
Yeah, I'm in.

47:07.180 --> 47:14.000
Yeah, I'm getting paid five times as much for a sale of this story to France that I got originally.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.320
And it just was meaningless.

47:16.580 --> 47:20.520
So I just stopped keeping, keeping getting a count of these things.

47:21.100 --> 47:24.360
If you ask me, I couldn't tell you, I have no idea.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.620
And I don't particularly care about making that much money.
