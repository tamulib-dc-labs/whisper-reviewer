00:05.200 --> 00:14.600
Fiction teachers seminar, institute at the University of Kansas and James Gunn was one

00:14.600 --> 00:17.280
of the, oh here's Jim Bain, raise your hand.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.620
She's going to tell you a little bit about the history of the play.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.380
She's one of the authors of it.

00:27.380 --> 00:30.560
And then I'm going to introduce the cast and we're going to get started.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.380
Yeah, you'll get to say hi and stuff when I...

00:37.280 --> 00:37.480
Yeah.

00:39.300 --> 00:45.200
As Susie just said, this story was written this summer at the Third Annual Intensive

00:45.200 --> 00:47.820
English Institute on the Teaching of Science Fiction.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.780
And if you think the title was bad, you should have been at the course.

00:52.260 --> 00:56.140
We went to class from nine o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock in the evening

00:56.140 --> 00:57.040
for three weeks.

00:58.600 --> 01:03.000
And we got a little crazy, like this t-shirt, and like this story.

01:04.980 --> 01:09.160
Two of the books on the reading list were James Gunn's The Road to Science Fiction 1

01:09.160 --> 01:09.580
and 2.

01:10.120 --> 01:15.100
And when it came time to title our story, it seemed perfectly natural to just extend his

01:15.100 --> 01:19.580
metaphor because this story really is stuck on the shoulder of the road.

01:21.410 --> 01:28.120
We also, of course, had to include Jim Gunn's campus in the story, as well as set it in

01:28.120 --> 01:30.320
Kansas where the class took place.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.320
And also, Steve Goldman was one of the teachers besides Jim Gunn, and they spent three weeks

01:37.940 --> 01:41.400
debating whether or not J. G. Belard wrote science fiction.

01:44.120 --> 01:48.900
Naturally, we got tired of hearing it, so J. G. Belard became our villain, and the debate

01:48.900 --> 01:50.680
was the subject of our story.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.520
We also got a little crazy with the punning.

01:56.780 --> 01:57.960
It's not that bad.

01:58.540 --> 01:59.180
I just figured...

01:59.180 --> 01:59.360
I just figured...

02:00.180 --> 02:00.660
Good.

02:04.960 --> 02:09.220
So that's it, stuck on the shoulder of the road to science fiction.

02:09.220 --> 02:12.180
In case you were wondering, the frisking at the door was to make sure none of you were

02:12.180 --> 02:13.680
carrying anything throwable.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.600
Both of them.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.920
From that side to this, in the cast, we have beautiful...

02:28.920 --> 02:30.140
Oh, I'm Jim Teacher.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.800
We have beautiful but dumb, who is Cliff Flint.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.220
Testing one two.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.640
Cliff, you're going to have to speak up.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.380
You've got such a delicate voice.

02:42.300 --> 02:48.220
Pat Buchanan is our lovely science fiction writer called Stila Idea.

02:51.260 --> 02:52.340
Closer to the mic.

02:53.400 --> 02:59.900
Next, we have our guest of honor, Mary Ann Mueller, and she is the wonderful mad scientist,

03:00.140 --> 03:00.840
Dr. Loom.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.060
Tell them what Dr. Loom's first name is.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.160
Yes, she does.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.020
It's fruit of the, isn't it?

03:12.240 --> 03:13.780
You'll get the references.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.500
Next to Mary is Mark Bernstein, and he is our villain, J.G.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.120
This is called casking against type, of course.

03:25.140 --> 03:25.460
Ha!

03:25.880 --> 03:27.660
And our narrator, Meg Cadlac.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.000
And I'm Susie, and I'm Tila Brown.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.820
And I don't know what that is.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.080
You were lucky to get the floor.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.420
Oh, jeez.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.200
Can we get some more corner?

03:43.200 --> 03:43.940
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.680
Sound effects by Nancy Tucker, and they were all her idea.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.920
I had nothing to do with it.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.460
All right.

03:50.060 --> 03:50.320
All right.

03:50.500 --> 03:50.720
All right.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.180
All right.

03:52.180 --> 03:55.100
Thank you.

03:57.620 --> 04:00.520
Stuck on the shoulder of the road to science fiction.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.700
In a small and cluttered laboratory in Erawan, Kansas,

04:06.380 --> 04:10.360
Dr. Loom, a frizzy-haired, absent-minded, thick-lensed,

04:10.520 --> 04:13.860
white-jacketed, ever-so-slightly-mad scientist,

04:14.540 --> 04:16.220
is conducting experiments.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.780
Bursting into the room a beautiful but dumb young man,

04:20.780 --> 04:23.380
BBD, skips up to the doctor.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.220
Be with me, you're so smart.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.820
I wish I could understand your invention.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.200
Don't worry, you're a pretty little head about

04:29.200 --> 04:31.020
at my sweet little papaya.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.440
Why don't you read your comic book?

04:33.980 --> 04:36.540
Dr. Loom turns back to the sparking panel,

04:36.920 --> 04:39.840
while BBD, waiting a few moments to be sure

04:39.840 --> 04:41.300
the conversation has ended,

04:41.980 --> 04:44.780
tiptoes gingerly to the high wooden stool in the corner.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.540
The massive wooden door shakes

04:47.540 --> 04:50.040
to the beat of a loud, powerful knock.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.900
A slightly stooped, hunchbacked robot

04:53.900 --> 04:56.060
with large protruding eyes

04:56.060 --> 05:00.740
leaves in a strong, silent, but mildly aberrant

05:00.740 --> 05:01.960
science fiction writer.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.260
The robot shambles over to Dr. Loom,

05:05.540 --> 05:07.300
hands her a small white card

05:07.300 --> 05:08.740
and retreats from the laboratory.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.780
Good afternoon, Dr. Loom.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.060
I am Stila Idea, star reporter

05:13.060 --> 05:14.780
and brilliant science fiction writer

05:14.780 --> 05:18.420
for a standing robotics magazine, otherwise known as ARM.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.860
I can read that on your card, young lady.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.600
However, I'm a scientific genius

05:23.600 --> 05:25.360
and very busy at the moment.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.260
I have no time to fritter away at idle conversation,

05:28.700 --> 05:29.960
so if you'll pardon me.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.540
Dr. Loom turns away.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.660
Excuse me, doctor, have you forgotten

05:33.660 --> 05:35.540
our appointment to discuss your latest

05:35.540 --> 05:37.080
world shattering invention?

05:37.860 --> 05:39.880
Oh, of course.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.040
Do excuse me, I have so much on my mind.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.540
Come over here and let me introduce you to Ego,

05:46.020 --> 05:48.420
the electronic gizmo orienter.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.900
Dr. Loom eagerly grabs Stila's beefy bicep

05:51.900 --> 05:55.420
and drags her toward a trapezoidal edifice of gleaming metal.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.580
Pulsing lights dot the upper third of the machine,

05:58.820 --> 06:00.780
like a theater marquee on opening night.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.920
A control panel, arrayed with a dizzying assortment

06:04.920 --> 06:08.880
of dials and switches, protrudes from the center of the trapezoid.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.200
Stila's eyes are immediately drawn, however,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.940
to a cylindrical shaft set into the right side of the machine.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.960
Two words, scrawled in orange day glow letters,

06:20.460 --> 06:21.320
straddle the shaft.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.760
As you probably know, Ms. Dia,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.160
it has long been my aim in life to bring all people

06:27.160 --> 06:31.400
the ineffable ecstasy I've known from reading science fiction,

06:31.880 --> 06:34.020
and I think I've finally found the perfect method.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.040
From his stool in the corner,

06:36.560 --> 06:39.920
BBD has been surreptitiously glancing at the two women.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.160
Ever since Stila I.D.A. had entered the room,

06:43.560 --> 06:45.860
BBD's heart had pounded frantically,

06:45.860 --> 06:48.380
and his sculptured hands had perspired.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.880
This humble machine you see before you

06:50.880 --> 06:53.600
has the power to alter mainstream fiction

06:53.600 --> 06:57.380
by introducing a disjunctive element into the story,

06:57.860 --> 07:01.560
thus changing mundane literature into its highest form,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.360
science fiction!

07:03.360 --> 07:04.320
Thank you!

07:08.280 --> 07:10.040
But how does it work, Doctor?

07:10.720 --> 07:13.780
The Doctor launches into a long technical explanation

07:13.780 --> 07:17.280
which confuses Stila and totally baffles BBD.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.900
Do you mean to say that all I have to do

07:19.900 --> 07:22.140
is push this lever to activate the machine?

07:22.240 --> 07:23.620
Oh no, no, don't touch that!

07:24.040 --> 07:25.720
The lever moves both ways.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.140
If you push it towards the word dis,

07:28.740 --> 07:31.860
ego will change mundane literature to science fiction.

07:31.860 --> 07:35.520
But if the lever is in the dis-disposition,

07:36.060 --> 07:39.180
science fiction loses its disjunctive element

07:39.180 --> 07:41.380
and becomes mundane.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.140
Heaven forbid, Doctor,

07:44.280 --> 07:47.000
that anyone would ever do such a dastardly deed.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.920
At that moment, the robot appears in the doorway

07:49.920 --> 07:53.700
with an apologetic expression on its chrome face

07:53.700 --> 07:56.700
and informs Doctor Loom that an urgent message

07:56.700 --> 07:59.220
has just arrived from Senator Proxmire.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.880
With an exasperated shake of her frizzy head,

08:05.140 --> 08:07.700
Doctor Loom leaves, followed by her faithful robot.

08:08.660 --> 08:12.460
Stila, left to her own devices, begins examining the lab,

08:12.900 --> 08:15.360
carefully avoiding contact with the crucial lever.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.040
She scans the rack of test tubes,

08:18.240 --> 08:20.520
smoking vials and moldy Petri dishes.

08:21.620 --> 08:25.520
Suddenly, it is as if there were a spark from across the room.

08:26.060 --> 08:30.640
Two pairs of eyes meet and for a moment, time stops.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.060
BBD slowly rises from his stool,

08:34.180 --> 08:36.080
the comic book slipping from his grasp.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.080
Stila rushes forward to retrieve the magazine.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.660
Part of me, I think you've drunk this.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.300
Stila glances at the cover.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.040
Gosh, are you a deaf Dodger's fan too?

08:47.660 --> 08:49.220
BBD blushes prettily.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.860
You'll never believe this,

08:51.960 --> 08:55.020
but I have an exquisite collection of deaf Dodgers holograms

08:55.020 --> 08:55.700
in my apartment.

08:56.220 --> 08:59.200
If you are free tonight, perhaps I could show them to you.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.080
Gee, I'd love to, but I'm not sure my mother would approve.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.780
She doesn't have to know.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.840
Leave the alley door unlocked and I'll meet you here tonight.

09:07.240 --> 09:07.500
Okay.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.620
Later that night, BBD impatiently paces in the laboratory.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.760
A soft scuffling sound from the alley attracts his attention.

09:16.460 --> 09:20.140
He throws open the door and finds himself face to face

09:20.140 --> 09:21.540
with a sinister figure.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.080
Little does he know that the tall, skinny, leather-booted,

09:26.080 --> 09:29.940
black-caped man wearing a wide brimmed hat which tilts over his face,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.700
revealing only a foo-man-chew mustache,

09:33.700 --> 09:37.040
is the diabolical J.G.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.280
BBD fates.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.100
With animal cunning, J.G. lifts the crumpled body

09:43.100 --> 09:46.460
and staggers into the alley, where waits a large but dumpy,

09:46.540 --> 09:47.780
mushroom-shaped vehicle.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.020
Across the side of the ship are stenciled the words,

09:51.020 --> 09:54.120
Chee-Chee Engineers Ring World Kansas.

09:56.620 --> 10:01.420
J.G. flings the limp body into the craft and clangs shut the door.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.760
He slinks back to the laboratory.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.020
Once inside, he is instinctively drawn toward ego.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.820
He studies the control panel for a moment,

10:11.020 --> 10:13.520
then begins to manipulate dials and switches.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.020
Meanwhile, back outside, our unsuspecting heroine

10:18.020 --> 10:20.420
strides confidently toward the laboratory door.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.480
With a keen glance, she takes note of the unusual vehicle

10:24.480 --> 10:26.440
parked inconveniently in the alley.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.160
Mildly annoyed, she circles it.

10:29.740 --> 10:32.060
She gently pushes the laboratory door open.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.420
J.G., who hears the hinges creak,

10:36.860 --> 10:42.500
whips around only to find himself confronting the cool, clear eyes of Stila I.D.ia.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.580
Who are you and what are you doing?

10:44.580 --> 10:49.680
I'm a maintenance representative of serviceable pros, Inc.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.200
I'm doing a monthly service check on the disjunctor.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.600
Oh well, have you seen Mr. Loom's son, BBD?

10:56.880 --> 11:00.920
No, and if you'll excuse me, I must be going.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.880
Flipping through a copy of Doc Dodger's,

11:03.920 --> 11:05.520
Stila hears a rumble in the alley.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.600
It suddenly hits her.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.420
That's funny. That ship belonged to a different company.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.340
Who was that caped man?

11:15.380 --> 11:19.880
Stila rushes outside and sees the mushroom-shaped ship dwindling in the distance.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.460
She jumps into a bright red roadster

11:22.460 --> 11:26.280
and races after it through the gateway,

11:26.640 --> 11:28.680
over the mainstream, across the campus,

11:28.840 --> 11:30.220
over the river and through the woods,

11:32.040 --> 11:34.800
to the sinister castle harlan.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.120
Meanwhile, back at the laboratory,

11:41.120 --> 11:43.140
a voice filters down from upstairs.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.440
Is that you, my little cantaloupe?

11:46.320 --> 11:48.060
Little does Doc Dillum know,

11:48.280 --> 11:51.800
but her little cantaloupe is at this moment lying unconscious

11:51.800 --> 11:54.180
at the feet of the evil J.G.

11:54.580 --> 11:58.040
Curses! I didn't have time to alter ego.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.760
And now that meddling fool has followed me here.

12:05.340 --> 12:07.320
I've got to take care of her.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.980
At this moment, BBD regains consciousness and jumps to his feet.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.380
I recognize you. You are J.G. My mother's archenemy.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.360
Yes, you naive little fool.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.800
For years, your mother and I have been competing for control of fiction.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.420
As soon as I can get rid of that meddler,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.480
I will use your mother's machine for my own ends.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.320
But what's going to happen to me?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.900
You will stay here and do as you're told,

12:32.440 --> 12:34.540
if you know what's good for you.

12:34.540 --> 12:38.360
J.G. stalks off the ship, locking the door behind him.

12:39.200 --> 12:43.140
Confused and bewildered, BBD flings himself across the control board

12:43.140 --> 12:44.200
and begins to cry.

12:45.140 --> 12:45.860
The ship rumbles.

12:46.540 --> 12:49.780
BBD is thrust to the floor by the force of the acceleration.

12:50.540 --> 12:53.680
In a matter of seconds, the ship's engines grind to a halt.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.240
With a sob, BBD faints.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.340
While all this has been happening,

13:06.660 --> 13:10.760
Stila somehow manages to find a seldom used secret door to Castle Harlan.

13:11.260 --> 13:14.640
She stealthily descends the cold, damp stairs

13:14.640 --> 13:17.000
and arrives at a dimly lit passageway.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.760
Light streams through an open door at the far end of the quarter.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.160
Stila creeps toward the door.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.600
Cautiously, she steps inside.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.140
She stares for a moment at the white-patted walls of the tiny cubicle.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.440
Directly opposite the door, the wall is lined with dusty shelves

13:34.440 --> 13:36.220
holding a plethora of bottles.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.760
And in some of the bottles are things.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.940
The door slams shut.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.820
The room is plunged into darkness.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.400
Meanwhile, back at the laboratory,

13:47.940 --> 13:50.440
Dr. Loom is frantically searching for BBD.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.980
At her wit's end, she turns to ego for help.

13:53.540 --> 13:57.940
If I can only orient ego to the brainwave pattern of BBD,

13:57.940 --> 14:02.300
perhaps it can locate my missing little grape cluster.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.700
Almost instantaneously, a signal light flashes.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.840
The speaker emits a small, frightened voice.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.500
I? Could it be?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.440
Back at Castle Harlan, Stila pounds at the locked door.

14:15.460 --> 14:18.120
A voice booms from somewhere above her.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.320
I hope you enjoy your stay.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.380
It will be a long one.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.000
Feel free to sample my wine collection.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.360
You really must try the amontillado.

14:28.740 --> 14:33.540
What have you done with BBD?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.020
But there is no answer.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.980
Only the fading echo of demonic laughter.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.040
For the love of God, Montresor!

14:45.260 --> 14:49.900
In a fit of ebbedification, Stila sweeps a row of bottles off the shelf.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.180
By a fortuitous coincidence,

14:53.180 --> 14:55.200
her fingers brush against a hidden switch.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.840
The door swings open. She is free.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.740
At this moment in the laboratory, the small, frightened voice cries out.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.100
Still?

15:03.880 --> 15:06.680
Our scientific genius adjusts numerous dials,

15:06.780 --> 15:09.080
frantically attempting to pinpoint her son's position.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.320
Bursting through the door with a robot at her heels,

15:12.860 --> 15:14.420
Stila confronts Dr. Loom.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.560
What's going on around here?

15:16.740 --> 15:18.320
That's what I'd like to know, young lady.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.380
After lengthy but hurried explanations,

15:20.380 --> 15:24.160
Dr. Loom and Stila agree that ego is their only hope.

15:24.500 --> 15:29.020
We need only one more coordinate to be able to triangulate BBD's position.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.680
At that very moment, the small voice cries out again.

15:32.840 --> 15:32.960
Live?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.300
Within a matter of seconds, ego fixes his position.

15:36.780 --> 15:41.140
Armed with this information, Dr. Loom and Stila rush to the experimental FTL ship,

15:41.260 --> 15:43.040
parked in a stylo behind the laboratory.

15:43.740 --> 15:47.200
Dr. Loom works the controls and the ship hurtles into outer space.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.800
Where are we going?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.380
To the Crab Nebula.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.260
If ego is right, we may have seen the last of BBD.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.420
What do you mean?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.400
Don't you know?

15:59.880 --> 16:04.000
The center of the Crab Nebula is a black hole.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.120
Stila gasps.

16:06.960 --> 16:11.320
By the time Dr. Loom finishes explaining black holes to Stila, they have arrived.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.300
Stila activates the view screen.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.760
Where is he?

16:18.120 --> 16:19.480
Do you see that speck out there?

16:19.840 --> 16:21.220
He is orbiting the black hole.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.640
There isn't much time.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.740
The two women stare at each other in consternation.

16:26.280 --> 16:32.320
Suddenly, a space-suited figure riding a lumbering multi-legged beast appears.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.220
An expert in alien biology, Stila recognizes it as a galloping coincidence.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.020
A voice crackles over the speaker.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.700
Who are you guys anyway?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.600
And what are you doing here?

16:46.940 --> 16:49.420
This is Dr. Loom, scientific genius.

16:49.940 --> 16:54.580
We are on an urgent rescue mission to save my son from being captured by the black hole.

16:54.940 --> 16:55.680
Who are you?

16:56.240 --> 17:00.080
Oh, I'm Stila Brown, and by a stroke of luck, I may be able to help you.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.660
Do you have any ruby red slippers aboard?

17:07.300 --> 17:09.240
Why, I'm wearing some.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.240
Listen carefully then.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.100
Close your eyes.

17:14.700 --> 17:19.440
And click your heels together three times, whispering the words,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.500
come to me, my melancholy baby.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.080
Breathlessly, Stila follows the instructions to the letter.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.980
Instantaneously, BBD appears at her side.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.540
The reunion is brief, but poignant.

17:34.260 --> 17:38.860
Answering their pressing questions, BBD recounts his conversation with J.G.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.980
That diabolical fiend, he must be stumped.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.500
J.G. has not been idle during the rescue operation.

17:47.060 --> 17:51.060
Short-circuiting the robot, he has gained entrance to the laboratory once more,

17:51.280 --> 17:54.760
where he is now in the process of carrying out his evil scheme.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.380
Fearing the worst, Stila and company rush back to the lab.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.660
Alas, they are too late.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.580
With a flick of the switch, J.G. sets the machinery into motion.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.520
Nothing can stop it now.

18:06.520 --> 18:12.420
In libraries and bookstores across the world, the machine begins subverting science fiction.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.920
Dying inside becomes death of a salesman.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.180
Babel 17 turns into Tristum Shandy.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.200
Dune is changed into Lawrence of Arabia.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.100
Ringworld becomes the story of O.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.540
And the world of Nal'e is transformed into the Scarlet Letter.

18:36.980 --> 18:42.080
But then, ego encounters the work of J.G. Belard.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.340
The machinery begins to hum and whine.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.380
Sparks fly from the circuit panels.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.660
The metal grows hotter and hotter, and the machine begins to tremble and rock.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.320
Is J.G. Belard a science fiction writer?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.880
It is twilight, and the machine stops.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.600
Thank you, people. It is now your first appreciation.
