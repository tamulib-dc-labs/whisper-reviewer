00:01.280 --> 00:02.960
We got till 11.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.840
You just have to cut out my costs.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.360
We can cut out.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.280
We can also, you know, if you want to start over.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.580
See, all I have to do is holler a big cuss word and you have to.

00:16.840 --> 00:17.860
He doesn't call me.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.080
Okay, George, I'll ask you first of all about your background, kind of how you grew up and what might have,

00:25.780 --> 00:28.800
what was in your background that might lead you to write science fiction?

00:29.280 --> 00:33.260
Since I know you write other things, we'll talk about that, but we'll concentrate on science fiction.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.640
I don't know, you know, specifically where you look for, where you began, or anything like this.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.820
I'd have to go with Tom Corbett's Space Cadet.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.840
Six years old.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.280
It was a Saturday morning show at the time.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.140
You can now see it on night flight on cable and realize how bad it is.

00:55.440 --> 01:01.460
But then it was just fascinating and they were they were showing on television the flash Gordon serials.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.380
When I was a kid.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.260
Comic books.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.480
Movies.

01:10.760 --> 01:21.260
And about the fifth grade, I realized through the junior high library that the things I'd been seeing visual.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.720
They really were printed matter.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.500
Also, the closest thing I had found to that beforehand was the Odyssey.

01:30.500 --> 01:39.680
Which in the fourth grade, I had read about six times because it had, you know, all the neat creatures that Odysseus fought.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.060
And I still want to need his books ever written.

01:45.260 --> 01:57.280
But I think sort of the early media, early television led into finding written things in junior high and which were Heinlein juveniles.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.920
I can't even think of the books that were put out then, but it would tend to be Heinlein juvenile type books.

02:06.720 --> 02:21.420
And from that to the book club, science fiction book club to sitting there no longer eating lunch at school so I could save my money and hit the small East Texas town that I lived in.

02:21.660 --> 02:25.820
Newstand every Tuesday and Thursday when the new books came in.

02:27.380 --> 02:33.640
And from then, you know, I, I, why or when I made the decision to be a writer, I don't know.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.220
It was sort of always there in the back of my mind.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.660
First tried to write short stories in 69.

02:41.480 --> 02:50.260
I just graduated from college, was working at a television station in Lubbock and was getting terribly bored with it.

02:51.960 --> 03:00.780
And had not read science fiction all the time I was in college and had picked up Lord Light and Dune and read those.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.660
And went, gee, there is something to this still.

03:04.340 --> 03:16.480
And so I wrote about three short stories and was immediately rejected and completely forgot about it until I moved to Dallas and became a member of the Dallas Science Fiction Society.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.120
And there met a couple of people were trying to write.

03:21.040 --> 03:34.920
Steve Utley, Jake Buddy Saunders, Howard Waldrop read what they were writing and had sold their first stories and got very jealous and said, I can write as bad as this.

03:37.200 --> 03:48.360
And in 72, summer of 72 decided I would write a short story month and made the first sale in September and the next short story sale in November.

03:48.360 --> 03:54.440
And first ped name novel in January, February of the next year.

03:55.780 --> 04:03.320
How long then did you continue having a real job before you decided to cut loose?

04:04.220 --> 04:10.800
I don't like that. Writing is a real job. How long did I have a weekly paycheck coming in?

04:13.200 --> 04:29.640
I quit. I was working for the Dallas Morning News, worked for them five years from 69 to 74, at which time my wife is through college, was a teacher.

04:31.360 --> 04:37.160
And she's sort of talking and we had talked and her thing was, okay, why don't you try?

04:38.720 --> 04:47.260
And I was making enough off the fiction writing at the time that we thought, well, it would be easy transition.

04:48.040 --> 04:58.520
It wasn't, but it was in 74, August of 74 when I quit the news and went full time freelance writing.

05:00.100 --> 05:05.320
Having been a reporter for five years, has that a good background for a writer?

05:06.020 --> 05:08.080
Is the writing style just so different?

05:08.680 --> 05:12.380
It took me about five years to realize how they both connected.

05:13.740 --> 05:23.860
I would not say a journalistic background was necessary for writing fiction or even would help most people.

05:27.200 --> 05:38.780
The greatest value and some people may feel this is an insult to journalism, but the greatest value I had was it taught me to do deadlines.

05:39.140 --> 05:45.360
It taught me to write under pressure, taught me to turn out things very quickly when needed.

05:47.560 --> 06:00.140
It also gave me a nice scope of reference in different parts of life that most people usually don't get into.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.520
I was lucky and then I got to fill in.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.600
I was a general reporter for about three years and I was more or less the fill in beat reporter for everybody when they went on vacation.

06:13.220 --> 06:21.080
So I was suddenly running all the way from the county courthouse, the school board, city hall.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.940
You get to, I got to get in and see a little bit and get a little feel at least.

06:26.460 --> 06:36.920
But for the last few years I was with the morning news was county courthouse, which covered anything from the county politics to sheriff's office.

06:38.940 --> 06:44.360
Which is a nice little basis for sort of seeing the structure of power.

06:45.120 --> 06:53.760
Because most of my books tend to be about politics and power in a sort of a general sense.

06:57.620 --> 07:00.460
They can't see you shaking your head on the radio.

07:04.220 --> 07:11.420
There can't be much two way communication and then it's really bad on the telephone because then you can't...

07:11.420 --> 07:17.980
So sometimes there's a real pregnant pause and then both of them start talking at the same time.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.060
That's kind of interesting. That makes it hard.

07:23.420 --> 07:28.180
The Asper transfer then was your first published science fiction novel.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.000
When did you write it and how did that evolve?

07:35.420 --> 07:44.280
This was based on a short story idea I had when I was in college that I had written part of.

07:47.020 --> 07:54.020
And I had written the short story, shown it to some other writers and they went, oh, this is awful.

07:54.920 --> 08:00.260
I'd sent out the short story and apparently the magazines felt the same way.

08:03.380 --> 08:06.360
The ending I liked and I said, this is a nice ending.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.000
So if it doesn't work as a short story, maybe I can put a novel around it.

08:12.000 --> 08:28.220
And the novel sort of stemmed from about three years there of death penalty trials and very long sentence trials.

08:28.220 --> 08:44.360
It was the criminal justice in thing at the time in Dallas to give these multiple thousand year prison terms.

08:47.620 --> 08:54.700
And the whole thing sort of seemed ludicrous to me and I'm very much against the death penalty.

08:54.700 --> 09:02.540
It just seems like a waste. There ought to be a way to do something about it instead of wasting human life.

09:03.720 --> 09:14.180
And the whole thing sort of started as thinking, well, why not use a prison colony planet the way we settle parts of this country.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.360
And that never really got into the Asper transfer, got into Shadow Man later.

09:18.360 --> 09:24.240
But that's where the book sort of stemmed from was going to those trials.

09:25.160 --> 09:31.640
And it also at that book point, I realized when I threw this is a Western and not a science fiction book.

09:32.600 --> 09:40.380
And I think it was that book that I decided if I had a Western idea, it would be written as a Western and not a science fiction.

09:41.800 --> 09:48.780
And the only time I would use science fiction as a tool is when it was there as a tool, you couldn't tell the story any other way.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.740
Which led to the most recent book, which is enemies and is a Western.

09:55.980 --> 10:00.340
And it could have been done as science fiction, but I think it's stronger doing it the way it was supposed to be done.

10:01.400 --> 10:11.900
So you're saying that as I'm learning in this process, a lot of writers write in various genres, not just science fiction, but they'll write Western and Texas.

10:12.100 --> 10:19.780
So you're saying they're not really that far apart. There are elements common to both. And sometimes you could swing either way.

10:19.980 --> 10:28.140
Oh, definitely. I think the mistake is you get a lot of bad science fiction by people who should have written it as a war story, a mystery.

10:29.380 --> 10:35.620
A romance or whatever they they're so hung up on science fiction is the only way to tell a story and it's not.

10:36.540 --> 10:51.840
It's the only way to tell certain stories. And that's what I'd like or what I'd like to do is limit those certain stories for me to science fiction and not try to bring in stories that would be better told in another field.

10:53.060 --> 11:08.620
It's a mystery, right? It is a mystery. If it's a Western writer's Western, it's probably be a stronger story than trying to make up a whole society, whole world to handle it when it already exists.

11:08.900 --> 11:13.240
And then you can play with the characterization instead of having to make the background.

11:14.820 --> 11:22.660
I'm glad you brought that up. One thing I got to ask you because I couldn't find any addiction. What's a punch at?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.440
I know who I know who that's who.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.480
So that was deliberate.

11:30.860 --> 11:40.560
It was deliberate. It was a little bit of Tuckerism of using a friend's name for something. And that's what I did.

11:41.300 --> 11:46.580
I had a fever, but when I couldn't find it anywhere else, well, maybe it's Italian or something.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.160
I can't find it. I thought that.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.840
Okay, I'll ask you to comment then.

11:56.140 --> 12:01.840
Major books published the Esper transfer. What did you think of the cover and the promotion?

12:02.760 --> 12:06.820
This was your first novel. I'm sure you're proud of it. Do you think they did it justice?

12:09.580 --> 12:20.300
Probably, you know, in retrospect, it wasn't all that great of a novel. I'm not saying it's bad, but the more you write, hopefully the better you do.

12:20.700 --> 12:25.020
And by the time that book came out, I had other projects.

12:29.640 --> 12:36.300
So it's one of these strange things with me. The project's done. It's sold. I'm on 20 other things.

12:37.280 --> 12:44.860
And the high for me is selling it, having it accepted. And I probably should pay more attention to promotion and so forth.

12:44.960 --> 12:53.400
But it's hard to get excited about something that you wrote 18 months ago and you've had three other projects completed in that time.

12:53.980 --> 12:56.560
And you're working on another one and that has your interest.

12:58.260 --> 13:02.960
I heard Kurt Douglas say this and this is the only person I've ever heard say that.

13:02.960 --> 13:13.700
That once you finish something and you're onto something else, it's hard to get back to where you were on that and really enjoy if there's any achievement there because you're working on something new.

13:14.220 --> 13:20.100
And I was really surprised if you're somebody else say that because I never heard it before. But that's the way I am on it.

13:22.420 --> 13:30.980
It's major books was a little known book company and the distribution on it was apparently atrocious.

13:35.280 --> 13:40.200
Nobody read it. Nobody saw it. The cover was OK.

13:40.900 --> 13:46.920
It sort of surprised me that the at least the creature they rode was what I had described.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.200
There were no wing demons in it, but we're on the cover.

13:54.080 --> 14:01.900
The surprising thing is the last copy I saw that sucker selling. I think it was a $1.75 book, $1.25. I can't remember.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.760
I was going for five bucks and I was like, hey, wait a minute.

14:07.620 --> 14:11.840
But it probably got what most first novels got, which was a little or nothing.

14:17.260 --> 14:21.320
OK, Shadow Man was then the next science fiction book that came out.

14:21.340 --> 14:26.400
It was also the first one I read before I met you in Love Book. I read it.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.120
That's why I know that the G.O.W. Proctor had written.

14:31.480 --> 14:39.200
The thing that I find interesting in your science fiction, you don't hit us in the face with the science fiction.

14:40.320 --> 14:47.540
It's self-explanatory. The guy goes in and I wrote down the accelerated growth module and the talking caps.

14:48.920 --> 14:55.100
It's mentioned offhand and you don't go into the professor so-and-so does go into two pages of lecture on what it is.

14:55.940 --> 14:59.960
It's just self-explanatory. I think that's a talent that not every writer has.

15:00.260 --> 15:05.780
There's not explanations in your books. I think they are much more interesting for that reason.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.640
Good. So that's what I'm trying for.

15:09.180 --> 15:14.860
So you consciously, this is something you consciously try to do. You know, use that lecture mode.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.800
We have to hear how the hell the drive works.

15:19.600 --> 15:24.260
Yeah, definitely. First of all, it's bad writing.

15:25.140 --> 15:33.820
And I think more than that, it's bad reading. I notice that in other people's writing when they do it and you go, oh my God,

15:33.820 --> 15:41.960
I'm fixing to have to listen to a chapter of why this planet is revolving the wrong way or why this drive works.

15:42.260 --> 15:48.840
And it gets down to it. I drive a car. I have no idea how that car works.

15:49.060 --> 15:55.200
I mean, I've got a general idea, but it's not something every time I get in the car and I turn it on and put my foot to the accelerator.

15:55.500 --> 16:00.080
I think, well, the gas is going here and the spark plug is doing this and so forth.

16:02.520 --> 16:07.100
And I think your future future characters that you set up are not going to do that.

16:07.220 --> 16:13.740
They're going to hop on the bus. And if that bus is automated in some way, they're not going to even notice it.

16:14.280 --> 16:28.140
And so you have to slip that in on the reader to I believe in introducing new phrases and then immediately explaining that phrase is by showing its function

16:28.140 --> 16:35.020
or are trying to come up with the words to describe it in its title.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.720
I think that's good. It doesn't slow the reader down at all.

16:40.240 --> 16:47.360
And I've had non-science fiction readers going through my stuff and saying they were able to read it because of that.

16:49.940 --> 17:01.220
One phrase that I put the quote, the yearly Psycho Profile exam to eliminate any social tendencies that might not be a bad idea.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.960
I think it's anti-social tendencies, wasn't it?

17:05.000 --> 17:11.700
Yeah, I was taken by that phrase. I thought that was pretty interesting.

17:14.140 --> 17:22.040
Let's see. I also have written out here in the margin of Tommy John and the Carrie Ann as far as are these little inside jokes or is that just...

17:22.480 --> 17:24.920
I'm a fan of Tommy John. He's a hell of a pitcher.

17:26.700 --> 17:32.340
What's really funny is that probably one of the biggest Yankee fans I know read the book and never noticed it.

17:33.820 --> 17:38.360
They used to call him the man with the bionic arm before the bionic thing was in.

17:38.360 --> 17:43.600
And I just always been a Tommy John fan, so I named a spaceship after him.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.560
Carrie Ann was a song I happened to like at one time.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.580
I think everybody slips things like that in.

17:53.640 --> 18:00.000
I won't say they're in jokes or anything, but they make it a little more enjoyable for the reader to catch something like that occasionally.

18:00.200 --> 18:04.220
I have never seen any writer of any field that doesn't do stuff like that.

18:04.740 --> 18:06.300
You can't help but do it.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.380
Sneaker in there.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.040
Okay.

18:12.640 --> 18:18.440
For what it's worth, Shadow Man is a direct...

18:19.580 --> 18:23.560
spin-off of what I was talking about the courthouse. That is your death penalty book.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.260
This is an answer to the death penalty.

18:26.260 --> 18:35.740
And I, the whole idea is getting back to, I think, what Gordy Dixon once said of setting up a utopia and then finding what's wrong with it.

18:35.820 --> 18:36.860
And that's your story.

18:37.280 --> 18:43.980
And this is where we had the planet colonized by hardened criminals with Ted.

18:45.760 --> 18:50.760
One thing I call brain wipes and new personality implants.

18:50.760 --> 18:58.480
And they were totally happy world until they realized what they had formerly been, or at least into one character hat.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.860
And that did stem from all the death penalties of what you do with hardened criminals.

19:06.100 --> 19:11.040
Well, find something you're wasting a lot of flesh that could be used for something else.

19:12.700 --> 19:16.960
And got to the thing of good and evil at the end, which was a...

19:17.720 --> 19:25.600
I don't know if it was that majorist to try and come up with something you do with hardened criminals and use them in some useful purpose.

19:26.300 --> 19:32.060
Whether or not we'll ever have that capabilities or not is, you know, yet to be seen, but I thought it was interesting to play with.

19:32.420 --> 19:37.400
So Shadow Man and the S4 transfer had the same root.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.060
Yeah.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.360
The psychic clue you were referring to.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.180
Definitely.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.660
The idea. Okay.

19:43.200 --> 19:43.640
Okay.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.120
Okay.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.520
I liked Fire at the Center.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.780
And I was going to ask, first of all, was that your title in the second of all?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.300
What does it refer to?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.520
Because I missed it.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.280
Fire at the Center is my title.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.320
Surprised me that they kept it.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.200
The reason they kept it is apparently fire is one of those buzzwords that sell books.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.620
Lust in the dust.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.600
Lust sells books.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.320
So do fire.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.160
So does cat.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.840
Cat in the title sells books.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.840
Pure Amid means fire at the center.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.860
And the book is about pyramids.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.880
And that's the normal question is fire at the center of what?

20:26.560 --> 20:29.260
But that's what pyramid means is fire at the center.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.560
And I do mention it in the book.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.460
I usually read very carefully.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.640
I'm still glad I asked.

20:41.260 --> 20:44.160
I liked the thing I liked page one.

20:44.320 --> 20:44.840
I checked it.

20:44.920 --> 20:45.640
It's page one.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.180
You say there's no time paradox because you can't alter the past.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.080
And then you don't have to worry about that crap.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.960
I get tired of the silverberg does at humor.

20:55.120 --> 21:00.960
So I get tired of all this again, this endless lecturing on why there wouldn't be a time paradox.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.640
You just said, let's get rid of it.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.000
And you did.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.900
That's what being God does.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.400
And that's a basic thing.

21:08.480 --> 21:12.220
A writer is you set up the science fiction you set up.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.740
I guess the rules to this game.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.220
Now the next book I write may have a paradox in it.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.680
If I reuse time travel here, but you set up the rules to this game.

21:22.680 --> 21:29.360
And if the reader can accept those rules, then the book, they can suspend their belief and read the book and enjoy it.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.840
I find shadow man a much better book.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.580
I think it has a little more depth to it.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.420
It's got a lot better characters in it.

21:39.460 --> 21:48.200
And the readers like fire at the center better, which shows that a writer usually doesn't know what the readers will consider the better book.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.720
Okay, next question is the one I alluded to earlier.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.880
You must have been infatuated.

21:57.880 --> 22:08.380
I haven't infatuated under the lines of dinosaurs or maybe you still are because the trying to source wreck scenes were realistic and they seem to be lovingly done and careful.

22:08.540 --> 22:08.860
They were.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
They were done for my wife.

22:11.200 --> 22:18.420
The original scene first 40 pages that book is a novel that I had written strictly for my wife.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.580
It is a dinosaur collector.

22:24.060 --> 22:29.360
They were written only for her though I tried to sell the stories again where I wrote a story in the short story would sell.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.140
The novel in this case would sell.

22:34.720 --> 22:43.980
So I put another story with it and just use that as an opening action adventure scene to meet the character gets the reader interested in the book.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.380
But you know, that was written from a wife and my wife only.

22:48.400 --> 22:56.660
And that a lot of people else, a lot of other people have enjoyed it means there's a lot of dinosaur fans around.

22:59.240 --> 23:07.240
And everybody seemed to like the the Regina rather than the Rex at the end.

23:07.780 --> 23:11.160
It hit me whenever I was reading it hit me.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.880
It entered my mind that maybe that is a female, especially.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.960
They almost got together.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.420
Things kind of change.

23:18.620 --> 23:28.540
But I like the little tail of the attention that you paid just to the crashing sounds and in the description of how it was wondering.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.920
But it's really pretty pretty fast and the second teeth.

23:32.220 --> 23:33.380
It's a chicken running.

23:33.820 --> 23:35.540
Yeah, with a long tail out behind.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.700
It's probably one of the most ungrateful things you can imagine.

23:39.280 --> 23:57.020
And yet you think I think there's this a love affair with most people in science in science or most people in general with these gigantic creatures that disappeared from the earth and you're just too tempting not to go back and play with them somewhere.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.660
And suddenly they were here and they're gone.

23:59.820 --> 24:01.220
Well, they learned to hide in the trees.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.140
They're still here.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.340
Yeah, I was interested.

24:06.340 --> 24:11.940
I got interested in seven and that had a lot of my daughter is six.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.680
She's very interested in the nine.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.480
I never brought them up.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.020
Of course, my is a smaller.

24:18.620 --> 24:19.460
I myself.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.180
Look at it.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.080
We have a we have a plegisaurus fin bone now.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.280
Wow.

24:27.720 --> 24:35.600
I mean, from one of their flippers, we have occasionally we go out and big rocks get fossils and so forth and somebody brought us.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.060
A plegisaurus bone actually brought to my wife.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.500
One of their little fin bones, which is bigger than your foot.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.980
Bigger than my foot, which is awful large.

24:48.460 --> 24:52.060
And people bring her dinosaurs everywhere.

24:53.880 --> 25:00.520
Students that go over to Russia on summer trips and so forth will.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.180
It's weird.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.020
They'll bring her back these little ceramic dinosaurs.

25:03.320 --> 25:14.420
They picked up at a museum somewhere or I'm wearing shirt that says, have you hugged your dinosaur today, which came from the Albuquerque Natural History Museum.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.060
The person brought us back.

25:17.240 --> 25:22.100
I think we gave up counting when she had some 700 something dinosaurs.

25:25.120 --> 25:36.600
It shows the future that you portrayed for humans in this book was pretty grim.

25:36.700 --> 25:44.260
The cabinites and the off-grenists of rigid authority versus maybe some kind of diversity.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.540
First of all, is there any significance in the names, the cabinites?

25:47.900 --> 25:48.140
No.

25:48.140 --> 25:51.360
No, I found out the main character.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.680
There's Nils Kenler.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.740
And this is something I didn't know.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.740
And I named the group the loft granness or the loft grant.

25:59.840 --> 26:04.800
And I got a couple of letters saying, well, you name that after Nils loft grant the guitarist.

26:04.980 --> 26:05.740
I never heard of him.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.860
I was going to ask you if you'd heard his name.

26:07.980 --> 26:08.980
He works with them young.

26:09.360 --> 26:09.920
He does now.

26:09.920 --> 26:21.620
Well, I found a, actually what I found out of you, I think he was a guitarist for a, what's his name?

26:22.980 --> 26:25.160
The heart shaped glasses plays the piano.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.580
I think it was with Elton John for a while.

26:27.740 --> 26:29.780
And I'd never heard of him as a guitarist.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.340
And it really surprised me.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.240
It's one of those things character in that book.

26:37.700 --> 26:43.820
I can't think of the name now, but it came back that one of the copy editors were reading and I had called.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.820
And I hit the name one of the writers of hair.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.860
And I had to change that name.

26:53.180 --> 26:58.120
I did not realize that either, but there was no Nils loft grant in there.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.440
It's something that I'd never heard of the man.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.080
Just to your points.

27:02.080 --> 27:08.960
I know Larry Nivens, although the murder mystery on the moon, he's got a character named Naomi Mitchison.

27:09.800 --> 27:14.420
And there's a science fiction writer named Naomi Mitchison and he said, murder group.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.100
That's so, that's subconscious does funny things.

27:18.900 --> 27:25.380
There was a little throwaway line you had in this book that I also wrote down the 50% of the population.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.140
That is not a throwaway line.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.040
But I liked that.

27:30.040 --> 27:35.980
That was not a throwaway line, but has to do with what I feel when every day morning when I shave.

27:36.060 --> 27:39.280
This is a dumb way to start the morning with a razor at your throat.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.260
That's the best line in the book.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.000
I wrote it down.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.520
I like to quote quotes and that was one that impressed me.

27:49.340 --> 27:56.880
The other one that I that I used was that the only universal religious symbol is the collection tray.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.460
Let's send there. Those were both very purposely put in.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.580
But my favorite line in the book is about the razor.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.020
I chuckled one with that one.

28:12.120 --> 28:20.740
Okay, and obvious question and you must be somewhat interested in pyramids and so-called pyramid power.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.800
They seem to be universal symbol kind of attractive.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.760
Not like dinosaurs, but...

28:26.760 --> 28:27.500
No, I'm not.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.360
Just do your research.

28:29.680 --> 28:41.600
What it was is way back when, before it became the craze, some kid came up to my wife and was putting it out and showing her these books and showing her some stuff.

28:42.020 --> 28:47.860
And I started looking then and realized, gee, this is a nice little thing for quacks to play with.

28:50.140 --> 28:59.800
And that's sort of the basis of the book and the pyramidology or whatever they're calling it now came around before the book ever got published.

29:00.400 --> 29:09.620
Most of the stuff was done prior to all the pyramid interest coming out, which surprised me that I guess it didn't.

29:09.620 --> 29:17.320
And it's just, it's ripe for people that are looking for secret answers instead of using their heads.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.400
But that sort of thing makes very interesting science fiction.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.920
It's fun to play with flying saucers are fun to play with.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.020
I don't believe in them.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.640
I believe in alien intelligence.

29:27.920 --> 29:35.020
And I don't believe intelligent beings would be doing all the so forth of things that you see that are so forth.

29:35.780 --> 29:41.840
So called UFO type folks saying they're doing, but it's fun to play with.

29:42.460 --> 29:43.940
You see that some of it.

29:44.300 --> 29:44.740
Okay.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.300
At the end of the book, everybody takes off in the seeker.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.440
Looks to me like if you wanted to, you could continue.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.360
Do you have any plans to book has been written, the book has been sold.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.580
It's called Starwings.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.100
Fawcett bought it.

30:01.420 --> 30:04.540
Fawcett was then sold to Ballantine books.

30:05.820 --> 30:10.140
The book is back in my hands now and we're trying to sell it again.

30:10.760 --> 30:14.040
We got the money for it, but Ballantine didn't want to publish it.

30:15.780 --> 30:21.320
So whether or not the book is ever published is really wild speculation.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.080
I'd like to see it since I published since I wrote it.

30:28.260 --> 30:37.000
Oh, for those who care, it begins 200 years after the ending of the first book and has nothing to do.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.080
But does not involve the characters in the first book.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.660
That does involve another mind merger.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.360
Who is mostly mechanical.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.440
He has been blown away during a new loft, Venice, Cavanaugh war.

30:56.820 --> 31:07.380
And the woman he loves, who is also a psychotic and it is psychotic, despite what the editors changed it to,

31:10.580 --> 31:15.000
has been killed and they have cloned her again.

31:15.140 --> 31:20.060
And it is an 18 year old version of the woman he loves and he's having to work with her.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.040
She was nice and young.

31:25.000 --> 31:34.260
And he falls in love with the new woman as differently, but it involves time travel again, but in a totally different way.

31:34.560 --> 31:40.940
And we do find out about the urn and the seeker and everything, but it does begin 200 years.

31:42.980 --> 31:46.920
Is this going to be your known process in the new writing science fiction?

31:47.520 --> 31:49.540
Are you going to stay in this known process?

31:51.440 --> 32:02.440
No, no, it's just that the fact it wasn't even the original design of the book was not to be a sequel.

32:02.640 --> 32:08.060
The book stands on its own and it just happened to be I had this set of circumstances.

32:10.260 --> 32:13.680
And this other book idea and they tied together.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.740
So why not use it?

32:18.200 --> 32:22.840
And then editor Fawcett said, OK, in fact, she even said, you don't have to do it this way.

32:22.900 --> 32:23.880
The book stands by itself.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.280
I said, well, we've got this and we've got that's why not use them.

32:27.340 --> 32:38.620
So we went ahead and did it as a sequel, which may be the problem in trying to resell the book because most publishers don't like to pick up sequels that were done by another company.

32:39.660 --> 32:45.420
So might be the situation when we get the center back that we can sell them as a package deal.

32:46.620 --> 32:56.640
OK, tell me then about Lone Star's universe and how that got started and how the idea of regional anthropology, et cetera.

32:57.940 --> 32:58.860
Sure insanity.

33:02.180 --> 33:16.260
One day a bunch of us who had just made their first sales were sitting around laughingly saying that one day there's going to be enough writers in Texas that we put out our own anthology and to hell with all these people that will buy our stories.

33:17.580 --> 33:21.120
And as it was, I think that was Howard Waldrop was there.

33:21.120 --> 33:26.580
Stephen Lee, Buddy Saunders, and we're just sitting around joking, putting a fanzine together.

33:29.620 --> 33:32.560
And I guess I was the only person that really sort of took it seriously.

33:35.820 --> 33:47.920
And as it was, Steve and I put a proposal together and sent it first to a man out in Midland, Odessa, whose name escapes me now, but he was doing the Texana type books.

33:48.960 --> 33:57.600
And he came back and liked the idea, but wasn't going to pick it up and suggested we send it to Heidelberg Press in Austin.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.460
And we did and they picked it up.

34:00.860 --> 34:10.780
And by that time, there were enough known writers in Texas and award winners that it really did seem feasible and seem like a good idea.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.080
And got put together.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.540
Sort of interesting.

34:18.800 --> 34:32.500
It makes a lot makes for a lot of jokes, you know, regional science fiction, but our thought was, you know, Texana's in and here's this whole realm that's never been really looked at.

34:33.820 --> 34:37.320
And what's funny is it sparked a lot of other regional science fiction books.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.040
It was the first and everybody chuckled and laughed.

34:40.040 --> 34:45.060
And then there was about five that came out on its heels because it had never been thought of.

34:45.700 --> 34:51.140
And what was funny is that I meet new editors in New York.

34:53.280 --> 35:00.620
They know my name be a lone star universe rather than some of the novels I've done, which is surprising.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.280
But again, New York is surprised by new ideas.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.220
And that's I think the reason it was noticed.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.440
I lived in New York.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.240
And they had the science fiction shop.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.820
They had never heard of it.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.660
I'd seen it in Texas.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.200
I'd seen books.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.580
Okay, that is a problem.

35:24.320 --> 35:29.480
I got a copy of it from Purple Unicorn last summer when I showed it to you.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.580
Oh, you're very surprised.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.860
Then I just saw Scott with about seven on his desk.

35:34.860 --> 35:44.840
So can you put the background on the scarcity and the warehouse quote unquote that's got books?

35:45.100 --> 35:51.660
Can you say that without getting as soon reliable about what's going on?

35:51.960 --> 35:58.440
Well, Heidelberg stopped publishing as best I can tell just about the time they brought out the book.

35:59.680 --> 36:04.440
There were big plans to do posters and everything to go with the book.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.340
You know, full posters of the cover, which the cover is gorgeous.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.000
It's one of those double take covers.

36:11.640 --> 36:15.740
And as was they sort of went out of business about that time.

36:16.440 --> 36:24.760
And far as I know, only a few thousand were distributed and they're still sitting in a warehouse somewhere making scarce item.

36:26.500 --> 36:32.220
Well, it's surprising that you go to conventions, large conventions in and out of state.

36:32.820 --> 36:37.020
And there will always be several people ask me how you get a copy of the book.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.400
It's rare because it was not distributed.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.800
There's apparently tons of the books still around.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.200
You just can't get ahold of them.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.360
It's a nice item to have for a collector.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.880
I'm trying to get paid.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.060
I told David collects hardbacks and said, you better buy a guy.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.840
I didn't get you to sign it and all, but it's one to have.

36:59.040 --> 37:03.960
Is there any chance that you'll ever get the rights back and get a paperback edition out or something like that?

37:04.060 --> 37:08.380
I don't think so because I think it is, you know, it's a limited item to.

37:10.360 --> 37:10.760
Texana.

37:11.100 --> 37:17.520
I really think it has more values, Texana than it does to the science fiction field as a whole.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.160
Those science fiction collectors want it because it is a first.

37:24.760 --> 37:25.600
The stories are good.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.120
I think there's a wide variety of stories.

37:28.960 --> 37:40.180
Science fiction reviews that I saw of it, their complaint was that there was a wide variety of stories in there that it wasn't all nuts and bolts and it wasn't all new way.

37:40.240 --> 37:49.660
But there was everything and that's the whole idea of the book was put to show the diversity of the science fiction writers in this state.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.000
I think it did that well.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.140
I think it produced good stories by everybody that was in there.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.500
Would you ever have any illusions perhaps?

38:01.440 --> 38:02.800
Of course.

38:09.420 --> 38:10.840
There may or may not be.

38:10.840 --> 38:29.180
It depends on, you know, I know one person now who has his editor for a Texas publisher and he is has mentioned in passing that he'd like to get a hold of the first book.

38:30.740 --> 38:34.780
Since it never was really distributed as maybe buy them all out if possible.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.360
Whether or not that'll ever happen is something else.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.260
But yeah, why not?

38:40.400 --> 38:40.840
It was fun.

38:42.140 --> 38:44.540
The people who got it seemed to enjoy it.

38:45.160 --> 38:50.480
And I still think if it could get some sort of distribution, it would be a money making book in Texas.

38:50.480 --> 39:08.660
Just the the the charisma of the state and the the come on chauvinistic attitude of the of Texans, which is equivalent to New York.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.480
We're just larger.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.160
We buy Texana.

39:14.540 --> 39:16.620
Whether we read it or not, we buy it.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.640
And I think there's a market for it.

39:20.520 --> 39:26.180
How did you get and maybe I should parent that why Harlan Ellison to do the full work?

39:26.340 --> 39:28.780
It's when baggy for her.

39:28.820 --> 39:29.960
It was actually good.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.440
Well, Harlan writes and I forwards.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.640
We knew Harlan and we may know qualms about it.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.980
Harlan was better known than we were.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.720
Harlan sells books.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.900
Harlan realized he sold books and he was willing to do it for us.

39:48.020 --> 39:54.460
He's also known to audience outside science fiction.

39:57.820 --> 40:03.920
Many cases people read his works and they do not read any other science fiction.

40:04.780 --> 40:07.080
So, you know, it was a selling point.

40:08.220 --> 40:11.940
Also, Harlan had a lot of connection with people here.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.740
He had a lot of friends here and he wanted to do it.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.560
Whether or not, you know, we would do that something like that.

40:23.900 --> 40:29.560
On a second volume, if there is ever a second volume, I don't know, but why not?

40:32.380 --> 40:36.840
And, you know, and I think it is a drawing point gets people to look at the book.

40:38.140 --> 40:40.020
They've ever had a chance to look at the book.

40:41.940 --> 40:46.860
Why is all of a sudden, why is there a large group of writers in Texas?

40:47.100 --> 40:49.080
This hasn't been, this isn't historical.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.400
They've mostly been on the coast.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.940
Is it just now getting to be a nice place to live, opening up?

40:55.500 --> 40:57.060
No, it's been here for 10 years.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.000
I mean, far as science fiction writers go.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.380
They've always been around.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.100
They've never been noted as Texan before.

41:04.100 --> 41:14.120
I think early 70s to mid 70s, we had a lot of fans who turned professional,

41:15.080 --> 41:16.740
started selling their stories.

41:17.180 --> 41:18.940
They were friends from all over the state.

41:19.700 --> 41:25.720
They suddenly became a very large group that we're selling and we're noticeable.

41:28.660 --> 41:38.300
That this group was here, had made it, gave a lot of other folks who wanted to write incentive to do it.

41:38.400 --> 41:42.260
And you've got a suddenly a whole second wave of Texas writers coming out,

41:44.120 --> 41:49.180
meeting them here for the first time that have just begun to sell their first stories or their first novel.

41:49.420 --> 41:53.000
But you suddenly got a second wave of Texas science fiction writers, which is kind of nice.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.440
Maybe we ought to flip it.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.300
I have one more question.

41:57.480 --> 41:57.960
I want to ask you.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.780
It looks like there's a little bit.

41:59.980 --> 42:00.220
Okay.

42:00.440 --> 42:07.240
I want to ask you, okay, you've also edited the science fiction hall of fame with Arthur C. Clark.

42:08.200 --> 42:14.020
How does it feel to be on the other side of the podium and be an editor in picking shoes?

42:14.580 --> 42:17.440
I think most writers think they're better editors than they are writers.

42:18.660 --> 42:22.880
In that case, with science fiction hall of fame, it wasn't a pick and choose thing.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.860
It was merely the paperwork of taking award winning stories.

42:29.060 --> 42:29.940
They were already chosen.

42:30.100 --> 42:38.320
It was just getting the contracts together and what should have been a three week short work

42:38.320 --> 42:42.500
to drew out to be six months of hard labor of tracking people down.

42:42.500 --> 42:54.460
And in one case, there was one of the writers had died and I had to work through this state.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.700
And it took four contracts before I ever got one returned.

42:58.700 --> 43:02.800
It was the same contract and they swore they were sending them back, but I never got them.

43:03.160 --> 43:09.100
So I said, what should have been a couple of weeks work turned into six, six months of ulcers trying to get the thing together.

43:10.620 --> 43:15.500
Do you recommend that all writers maybe go through that once just to see what it's like?

43:15.500 --> 43:18.320
Oh, definitely. See all the garbage you get to read.

43:19.320 --> 43:30.640
I think you probably have more of a normal editing situation with Lone Star Universe.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.660
I started out getting those stories.

43:35.100 --> 43:37.240
I had a lot of stories submitted that we didn't take.

43:38.540 --> 43:46.480
I was going to do something that I thought editors should do is tell them why you didn't like the story or here's what turned me off.

43:47.540 --> 43:55.480
And one of the first stories, the first line I had written have a story was ambiguous and I showed him why.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.360
And I got back the nastiest letter.

43:58.620 --> 44:03.680
And from that point, I wrote the little sorry, this is not fit our needs.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.640
This isn't worth my time and effort.

44:07.060 --> 44:16.340
So you suddenly realize what you get these terrible rejection slips that have been printed out because I think a lot of people probably react that way.

44:19.880 --> 44:21.360
What what are you going to do?

44:21.520 --> 44:25.760
You're going to keep writing science fiction in the westerns, ghost writing.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.260
Just enjoy what you're doing.

44:27.420 --> 44:29.280
You think you're going to keep it up for a while?

44:31.540 --> 44:36.760
One of the nice things about writing is it allows you the time to do other things that you want.

44:36.800 --> 44:43.040
I've painted a paint a little bit and recently turning to word processing.

44:44.400 --> 44:48.280
I've never played with computer in my life.

44:48.960 --> 44:54.620
I grew up believing you had to be a genius and spend your whole lifetime learning to use one.

44:55.780 --> 45:05.260
It was drug kicking and screaming into the computer store and fell in love and have written my first game for a computer.

45:05.900 --> 45:07.420
And I'm working on a second one.

45:07.500 --> 45:13.220
I'm using them to teach myself to program and I'm finding myself being drawn to that a bit.

45:14.660 --> 45:16.860
Writing allows me the time to play with that.

45:16.860 --> 45:26.020
So yeah, and I'll continue writing and I'll have the shot at going out on any sort of tangents that I want to and playing with that.

45:26.620 --> 45:32.120
I think I'll probably for the time being head for a lot of non science fiction projects.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.400
Things that I've been wanting to write.

45:35.680 --> 45:40.300
I want to do a book called Panels, which is about a science fiction fan.

45:43.600 --> 45:49.160
And talking about the sixties and telling from sort of a different angle.

45:49.280 --> 45:57.740
I think everybody lived through World War two wants to write a World War two book and anybody lived through the sixties wants to write a sixties book.

45:57.740 --> 45:58.900
And I want to do it a bit differently.

45:59.020 --> 46:03.220
And it's going to be told from a point of science fiction fan and blame it all on the Lone Ranger.

46:09.580 --> 46:11.700
Man has a rare book over there.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.480
Thank you.

46:16.060 --> 46:18.460
And didn't mention art once.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.720
No, I was going to talk to you.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.760
But I will get that later.
