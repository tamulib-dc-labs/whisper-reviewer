00:01.520 --> 00:02.840
Okay, the tape is rolling.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.280
You don't go to conventions.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.580
I noticed in Locust that you finally went to one.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.020
I didn't regard that as a convention.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.540
Okay, would you just prefer not to meet the fans personally or is it just kind of you're

00:19.540 --> 00:20.300
happy where you're doing?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.520
You don't especially like to travel.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.080
No, it's a very simple answer that nobody believes.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.800
I don't like to travel.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.900
Way, way back I was born in England.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.760
I lived a year in Spain.

00:30.940 --> 00:33.340
I came to this country until I was a teenager.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.600
I never spent more than two years in any one place.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.480
I finally spent four years.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.320
I was at boarding school, in high school.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.600
And when I finally got married and settled down, I said I don't want to move.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.540
Well, I was eligible for the draft.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.900
I got moved again in the Army, you know, two years back and forth.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.360
When I finally got where I wanted to be, which was warm, it was in Florida.

00:56.180 --> 00:59.420
I settled down and I don't like to move.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.040
I just don't do it voluntarily.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.340
I'm too used to being uprooted in childhood.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.280
So it's just a dislike for travel.

01:08.620 --> 01:12.180
Locally, I go and I dress the classes of my daughters in school.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.680
I don't have any trouble with this.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.680
It does take time and of course my time is valuable.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.280
But I like to meet people, especially when they're talking about my work.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.540
That's always easy to do.

01:24.660 --> 01:29.140
But going to a convention would mean go a week or so of my time.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.480
That is, I would have to prepare.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.600
I would have to get an airplane or a drive.

01:34.120 --> 01:34.920
I would have to come back.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.360
I would have to catch up on my sleep.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.400
I mean, oh no, it would be about a week gone, even if it were only a three-day convention.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.060
When you figure the preparation time and the recovery time and the travel time,

01:46.100 --> 01:50.180
a week of my time these days is worth a couple thousand dollars.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.320
And I have to think, is this worth this amount to me to go and meet a few people?

01:55.780 --> 01:58.020
Well, it depends on the people.

01:58.740 --> 02:03.440
I went to this SF research association meeting in Kansas.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.840
For two reasons.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.980
One, I wanted to give my other daughter some experience.

02:08.140 --> 02:11.720
I mentioned I'd taken one daughter when she was eight, well, I was 12, it was her turn,

02:11.720 --> 02:14.440
to go somewhere and do something, get a ride in the airplane,

02:15.140 --> 02:18.100
have had some experience away from home that was really meaningful.

02:18.960 --> 02:24.140
But also, they happened to have at that meeting, Theodore Sturgeon, whose work I've admired

02:25.000 --> 02:27.220
since I started reading science fiction.

02:28.120 --> 02:33.720
They had Frederick Poe, who I think may be the best writer in the genre today.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.480
They had Jack Williamson, who was the author of the very first science fiction novel

02:38.480 --> 02:46.160
in the first magazine I read, introduced the head James Gunn, who wrote one of my favorite

02:46.160 --> 02:47.200
all time stories.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.540
In other words, they had about four people there whose work I had really admired.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.220
And that was enough to make me, well, if I could meet them all at one time, you see,

02:56.420 --> 02:57.080
that made it pay.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.380
I went there to meet the people.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.200
I did meet them, complimented them on their work.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.960
People asked me for autographs.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.700
I never asked, I don't care about signatures, but I took Sturgeon's more than human, my

03:09.700 --> 03:16.480
35 cent copy, battered, and dates from the 50s, brought it to him, asked him to sign it.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.600
It's the only autograph I ever saw, or probably ever will, to seek.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.380
Simply as a gesture, because admiration for this man's work.

03:26.820 --> 03:27.380
So I went.

03:27.520 --> 03:32.220
I didn't regard it as a convention, I guess it took on some convention aspects, but I

03:32.220 --> 03:37.620
went because it was a meeting where several people I wanted to meet were.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.160
I did meet them, now that I've met them, I don't need to meet them again, and I'd probably

03:42.160 --> 03:44.160
be years before I go anywhere again.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.820
Your statement at the first saying how much money you would lose in a week prompted one

03:52.820 --> 03:55.920
of our people to ask, do you do anything for relaxation?

03:56.340 --> 03:57.480
So I'll broaden the question.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.040
What kind of schedule do you work five days, seven days a week?

04:01.600 --> 04:02.740
How many hours a day?

04:03.040 --> 04:05.560
People often ask me that, and I have a standard answer.

04:05.780 --> 04:08.540
I work all the time that my family will let me.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.180
You see, we have horses and dogs, feed the horses, chores in the morning take half an

04:14.180 --> 04:19.120
hour before I get up at six and about a quarter of seven, then I can settle down to my breakfast

04:20.080 --> 04:22.680
so that I don't have all the time of the day.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.500
I get about six hours a day, seven days a week.

04:27.340 --> 04:31.100
So it comes out close to a 40 hour a week working time.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.840
I try to read a little around the edges, and if I have to answer correspondence, it comes

04:35.840 --> 04:36.600
out at that time.

04:37.060 --> 04:45.600
The rest of the time is taken just in the business of living, of with horses and just

04:45.600 --> 04:48.360
reading the mail that comes in, eating and so on.

04:49.820 --> 04:54.960
So that even so, I'm fairly well paid now.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.780
This is a recent advantage.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.640
I mean, I earn a lot more now than I used to.

04:59.820 --> 05:07.880
You see, you forget that I sold my first story in 1962, published in 1963.

05:08.380 --> 05:10.960
I earned $20 for my first year of riding.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.120
I earned $160.

05:13.060 --> 05:20.520
I had all those lean years before I worked up the fat years, where now I do earn a good

05:20.520 --> 05:20.800
amount.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.140
I regarded as balancing out the earlier years.

05:23.140 --> 05:26.720
If you took my whole career as a rider, it would not be such a phenomenal income.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.460
I didn't get it earlier, and then I do get it now.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.860
But of course, if I go somewhere now, it comes out of what I'm earning now, so that's the

05:36.860 --> 05:37.700
way I have to figure it.

05:39.640 --> 05:44.220
Any chance with your schedule and with the number of books you've written lately you

05:44.220 --> 05:45.420
could get burned down on riding?

05:46.580 --> 05:51.500
Well, I wondered when, did you see my novel, Fisca's Circle, in the author's note?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.140
Yes, I read that, uh-huh.

05:53.880 --> 05:59.580
That's about as close as I've come, and that was an illness that I was trying to ride a

05:59.580 --> 06:05.440
knoll, and I had a month-long fever, and I wasn't suffering pain, but always with the

06:05.440 --> 06:05.660
illness.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.440
I don't know where it's going.

06:07.660 --> 06:08.600
The doctor couldn't do anything.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.000
I mean, is this leading to death, or is it just a minor thing?

06:12.120 --> 06:12.880
I had no way of knowing.

06:14.100 --> 06:20.020
It reacquainted me with my own mortality, and someone shook me up.

06:20.020 --> 06:24.340
And I just didn't see the world the same way after that.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.260
And so I had to take stock and say, what do I really want to do?

06:28.460 --> 06:33.020
And I had serious doubt whether I wanted to continue to write science fiction.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.160
Now, that would extend to fantasy also.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.640
The thing about fantasy is so easy and so much fun that while I'm in doubt, I can simply

06:39.640 --> 06:40.980
do it and make money.

06:42.060 --> 06:48.040
I didn't take nearly as much of a conscious decision there because my guts aren't in the

06:48.040 --> 06:48.960
fantasy so much.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.680
It is less important to me.

06:50.780 --> 06:55.520
It's more important financially, but it's less important in terms of my life's work,

06:55.740 --> 06:56.300
see what I mean?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.840
So I just had to think about it.

07:00.120 --> 07:05.660
But as it turned out, when I found a way to stretch the boundaries to include the new

07:05.660 --> 07:12.580
themes that I wanted to work on with inside the genre of science fiction, then it's fine.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.080
And I go right ahead and write.

07:14.080 --> 07:18.000
So burnout, I don't think so.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.000
I don't suffer from writer's block and I doubt that I'll suffer from burnout.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.460
I still have more ideas to write than I have time to write.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.700
I have a couple other projects I want to do and I can't make time for them.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.620
I'm too busy with the paying writing, you see.

07:33.140 --> 07:43.880
It appears that along in late 1977, I guess when the cluster books came out and then a

07:43.880 --> 07:48.400
list exploded as far as your productivity, you'd put up one or two novels a year for

07:48.400 --> 07:51.340
the previous years and then all of a sudden just a whole lot of novels.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.620
What happened then?

07:53.560 --> 07:54.760
That's not actually true.

07:55.940 --> 08:01.300
You see, I mentioned before I was getting blacklisted, I could only sell a portion of what I wrote.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.780
I was writing it.

08:02.860 --> 08:04.580
I'd piled up eight novels unsold.

08:05.960 --> 08:12.580
So in the 70s, say 50% of my output was getting into print.

08:12.580 --> 08:16.920
But when I finally got through that, it finally became apparent to some of these publishers

08:17.520 --> 08:20.680
that I was the one that was right, you see.

08:22.340 --> 08:26.780
See, the word was being spread by the blacklisted how difficult a writer I was to deal with

08:26.780 --> 08:28.800
and don't deal with this guy and so on.

08:28.860 --> 08:29.700
It's just nothing but trouble.

08:31.280 --> 08:35.860
When I finally, when that passed and I got to working with editors who knew me personally

08:35.860 --> 08:40.820
and knew it wasn't sell, then I could sell everything I wrote.

08:41.320 --> 08:47.000
So now you're seeing everything I write and it looks like an explosion, but I always was writing at that pace.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.000
I just couldn't get it into print.

08:49.220 --> 08:53.820
I still have several novels unsold and I have stories.

08:54.720 --> 09:00.000
I don't write them anymore, but at one point I assembled a whole volume, over 100,000 words,

09:00.220 --> 09:01.600
just of my own full stories.

09:02.340 --> 09:07.540
Put it together, I call it anthology, put on my name and anthology, tried to sell it that way.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.540
I couldn't.

09:10.260 --> 09:14.240
So that the answer is you're just seeing my work.

09:14.460 --> 09:21.700
Now actually I probably am more productive now than I was, but that's not a case of doing three times as much.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.860
It's a case of doing perhaps 50% more.

09:24.200 --> 09:30.140
Over the years I've gotten more experience so that I'm just more efficient at writing.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.660
I also have more time.

09:32.020 --> 09:39.500
My daughters are now teenagers instead of in the twos and threes and it takes me less time.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.860
I don't need to worry about taking care of them.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.120
They're off to school and I have time to write.

09:45.060 --> 09:51.340
So that my situation has gradually changed.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.060
It's probably my throat here.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.860
Alright, let's see. I've lost track again. Did I answer your question?

09:57.860 --> 10:01.200
Yeah, that pretty much answers that. It really wasn't an explosion.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.720
An explosion is more apparent than real.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.900
I do do about a third of a million words a year, but I always was a fairly prolific writer.

10:08.020 --> 10:12.940
I'm a slow writer, but I write all the time so that I get a lot done.

10:14.060 --> 10:17.780
Do you type your first draft or handwrite it and then type it or what?

10:18.020 --> 10:27.020
I use to type it back in the 1960s, but when my first child was born in 1967,

10:27.020 --> 10:32.120
my wife was out working because I didn't earn enough writing to support us.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.820
So I took care of my baby girl, changing her diapers and all this.

10:39.180 --> 10:43.680
That played havoc with my writing because I couldn't still download and typewriter.

10:44.740 --> 10:49.200
She was hyperactive and she wouldn't let me out of her sight.

10:50.940 --> 10:55.720
So that for a while I tried typing with the having the, again what you call it,

10:55.720 --> 10:59.440
the bassinet serve a little cradle I put in my lap and as long as I typed,

11:00.040 --> 11:04.500
she would be satisfied. But then if I stopped to think, she would wake up and start fussing.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.800
So I had to shift from the typewriter. I couldn't work that way.

11:09.280 --> 11:15.400
So that I went to a pencil and clipboard and I could literally drop the clipboard

11:15.400 --> 11:17.540
and grab her before she hit the ground if she was falling.

11:18.900 --> 11:24.880
Once she got over that stage, I found it so much more useful to be able to write with the clipboard

11:24.880 --> 11:31.300
that I just continued because now I write my wife drives and I simply sit there and write.

11:31.880 --> 11:36.540
I can't read while driving. I get carsick. But I don't have to see, I don't have to read what I'm writing.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.340
You see, I just need to see my place so I can write while driving.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.800
So clipboard when I went to Kansas, I wrote several hundred words in the air,

11:44.880 --> 11:47.160
you know, writing in the airplane. I just had my clipboard there.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.940
It would be hard to do with a typewriter.

11:50.080 --> 11:58.120
So it was just so versatile that I just continued it and now I do all of my writing in pencil on the clipboard.

11:58.560 --> 12:07.880
Then for the second draft I type it, get an idea of what I have and then I type it again for the formal submission draft.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.740
My creative work is done in pencil now.

12:13.180 --> 12:20.920
You seem to stick almost completely to novels. You don't seem to have had as many short stories as a lot of people

12:20.920 --> 12:24.500
and you do write the novels. Are you comfortable in a short story form as well?

12:25.240 --> 12:31.800
This is another change that was dictated by economics. I was comfortable in the short story form

12:31.800 --> 12:36.120
and in the novelette form. I only sold one out of four that I did.

12:36.120 --> 12:41.040
That was when I was earning $1,000 a year from writing. It wasn't enough.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.460
Inflation has changed things. This was back in the 60s but I needed more than that.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.280
I hear this interference again. You can hear me?

12:49.660 --> 12:53.020
Yeah, I can hear you fine. I think we'll be able to filter it out.

12:53.260 --> 12:58.980
I had to learn to do novels. They were not my natural form. I had a great deal of difficulty.

12:58.980 --> 13:03.660
I had to work. My career has really gone through a stair-step series of things I described,

13:04.020 --> 13:07.940
shifting to the pencil and paper so I could keep on working.

13:08.160 --> 13:13.680
Learning to do the novel, I did it because it was the only way I would be able to earn my living.

13:14.500 --> 13:19.220
Unless I could eventually earn my living and writing, I couldn't afford to continue doing it.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.440
My wife was working to support me. That's okay. She understood.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.240
But I wanted to get on my feet and not be dependent. You might say forever.

13:27.240 --> 13:33.540
Of course, later on when I started earning more, her whole income was going just to pay the tax on mine.

13:34.060 --> 13:37.360
She finally had to quit working. She couldn't afford to really.

13:38.100 --> 13:46.300
But in the early days, it wasn't that way. So I was able to support my family once I shifted to novels.

13:47.140 --> 13:54.620
But the first novel that I got into print, Thone, was very meticulously pieced together.

13:54.620 --> 14:01.060
Much smaller elements. It actually divides up into about 36 small parts carefully put together

14:01.060 --> 14:04.520
because I couldn't just start at the beginning and do a novel through to the end.

14:05.500 --> 14:13.320
The second one I worked on was this Arabian Night's Fantasy adaptation of Hassan.

14:14.140 --> 14:17.660
I had the storyline there from the classic story you see.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.780
So it was though somebody else had designed it, I collaborated with a, well, couldn't even say a dead man.

14:22.780 --> 14:27.400
I mean, this story had been in the circulation for many centuries.

14:28.700 --> 14:34.980
I did a couple of collaborations with other people. And finally, with my novel, Microscope, I did one big novel,

14:35.880 --> 14:39.640
unified all the way through. It was always conceived as a big novel.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.100
And after that, I knew I had mastered the novel form. I didn't worry about it anymore.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.200
But that's, it was hard. The novel was not my natural form. I guess it is now.

14:50.200 --> 14:57.160
But I had to acquire that taste. Had I had my own way, I would have stayed in the stories and the novelettes.

14:57.720 --> 15:04.580
But again, so much of my life has been dictated by economic considerations. I wish it were not so.

15:05.160 --> 15:11.020
I would rather have been a kind of writer than the critics applaud.

15:11.780 --> 15:18.700
A highly literary writer doesn't have to worry about things like food and rent and mortgage.

15:18.700 --> 15:24.620
But I always had to consider the economic aspect. So it was economics that put me into novels.

15:25.060 --> 15:30.780
Once I got there, I found I liked it. And now I have really very little interest.

15:31.560 --> 15:36.460
I did last month's Do A Story upon request, A Fantasy Story.

15:36.940 --> 15:41.640
Before that time, I think I'd done 15 novels in the 100,000 word category.

15:41.640 --> 15:49.060
And then, purely as another fantasy and an amateur magazine had asked for 50 word stories.

15:49.260 --> 15:57.680
That's 50 words, half a hundred. I did three of those. So I did 100,000 words or 50 words and nothing in between for the past five or six years.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.720
You mentioned a while ago that you had gotten your bachelor's degree in writing.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.140
When did you, at what point in your life did you decide to be a writer?

16:12.240 --> 16:21.900
Well, when I was two years in college. In 1954, I had gone through, I said it was eight years, it was six years.

16:22.100 --> 16:26.780
I'd taken courses through four years of high school and through two years of college.

16:28.460 --> 16:34.060
And decided what I wanted to major in. I said, I really can't do it at heart. I'm not good enough.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.660
I see the difference between a commercial and somebody who can sell his art.

16:40.200 --> 16:46.720
I mean, I was a good artist for the average man on the street, but to sell it, I just didn't think I was that good.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.860
I said, well, then what am I going to do? I'm in college education to complete here.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.200
I have to choose a major, do something important.

16:54.540 --> 17:00.860
So I went to writing. I really, I felt maybe I had something to say and I went ahead and tried it.

17:00.860 --> 17:05.220
I finished out, wrote a novel for my graduating thesis, never published.

17:06.640 --> 17:14.080
And that was the point of decision. I had to decide it in order to finish college.

17:14.400 --> 17:21.160
I did decide it. I never regretted it actually. It turned out I've made many wrong decisions.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.960
It turned out to be one of the right decisions.

17:24.160 --> 17:29.260
What influenced you to write science fiction instead of mysteries or porn or romance?

17:29.260 --> 17:35.140
What I read was science fiction. It was the one genre that I was conversant in.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.160
The time I was 13 and first discovered a astounding science fiction magazine.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.540
It was called Astounding in those days. It got hooked into it.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.400
And what I did for entertainment, it was science fiction.

17:47.620 --> 17:52.700
It was a whole different world, multiple worlds, each one of them better than the one I knew.

17:54.600 --> 18:00.800
And so that when I thought about writing, I said, if I go to some other genre that I'm not familiar with,

18:00.900 --> 18:06.400
I'll make all these mistakes. Whereas in science fiction, I knew that what I did was original

18:06.400 --> 18:11.520
because I had read everything in the field. Now, at today you can't do that.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.600
There's so much more published. But back in those days, there was astounding science fiction.

18:15.740 --> 18:19.880
There was galaxy. There was fantasy in science fiction. And there was amazing stories.

18:19.880 --> 18:26.580
And that was about it. That was about all. You read four-monthly or bi-monthly magazines.

18:27.620 --> 18:31.760
There was not much in the paperbacks. They were just starting up.

18:32.060 --> 18:35.000
Then Valentine Books was just starting a program with paperback novels.

18:35.420 --> 18:39.260
So that it was possible to keep up with the entire field. And I did. Then.

18:40.640 --> 18:46.220
So I knew it. I got into what was familiar and never left it.

18:46.220 --> 18:49.300
And I said, now I tried to leave it and I'm unable to.

18:54.940 --> 18:59.800
How did you break into science fiction? Then you started writing it. How long did it take you to break in?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.820
Okay. I think I answered that. It took me eight years of writing.

19:03.400 --> 19:10.940
Okay. Do you keep up with science fiction now with what's coming out or any small fraction of it?

19:10.940 --> 19:16.980
I tried to. I tried to. On the slow reader, I read it about 150 words a minute.

19:17.140 --> 19:22.140
It has to do with my education and follow-ups and so on. I got locked into a slow read.

19:22.680 --> 19:27.740
I can read faster, but when I do, I don't enjoy it and I don't have any retention. I don't really understand it.

19:28.200 --> 19:34.000
So that I have to be very choosy on what I read because most of my waiting time is taken up in writing.

19:34.620 --> 19:39.800
And I read slowly. So I select, I look at novels, I see what's winning awards.

19:39.800 --> 19:45.900
I read reviews, try to see what might interest me. A lot of what I read is for research.

19:46.740 --> 19:58.900
So I try to keep up, but I only read a very, very small fraction of what's published and often for perhaps the wrong reasons.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.120
I've read one novel, for example, by Gene Wolf. I don't know if he's familiar with him.

20:04.340 --> 20:05.900
Oh, I'm very familiar with him.

20:05.900 --> 20:11.000
I don't say he's regarded in the brighter circles as one of the best writers in the genre.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.600
Well, that's not why I read the first of his torture or novels.

20:16.420 --> 20:21.080
It's because it happened to be running very closely parallel to one of mine in sales.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.540
And I was curious, what is this one that I keep running next with, you know, what's it like? Is it like mine?

20:26.940 --> 20:29.940
So I read it and then said, hey, this guy is a good writer.

20:31.580 --> 20:36.460
But it was that, you might say, that accidental. I just don't have time to read the whole field.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.000
If I know that somebody's good, I will read to see for myself.

20:40.560 --> 20:44.040
But the fact is they're more good writers now than I can keep up with.

20:45.440 --> 20:52.460
In many people whose work I would enjoy, but I just don't have the time to read them, which I regress.

20:52.840 --> 20:57.880
Perhaps if I were a fast reader, but I took a speed reading course once and they didn't know what they were doing.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.680
They didn't teach me anything.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.600
So between the limitation of time and the slowness, I'm always reading something.

21:07.260 --> 21:10.500
And in the course of a year, I'll read 20 or 30 novels.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.080
But I know other people, they may read that much, you know, in a month.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.240
They cover a month. Of course, they're not trying to write novels at the same time.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.760
So I try to keep up with the important figures of the day.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.540
And some, Gene Wolfe was one.

21:29.360 --> 21:35.780
Right now I'm reading a Larry Nevin novel called Dream Park, just to keep up with what Larry Nevin is doing,

21:35.860 --> 21:37.800
because he's more or less one of my contemporaries.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.360
He broke into writing it about the same time I did.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.380
That sort of thing. I wish I were.

21:45.780 --> 21:52.440
I can't regard myself as being well educated in the field now because of the smallness of the amount that I read.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.180
Phone was your first novel, as you mentioned, while it go.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.960
And it was pretty popular. I don't know what the sales were, but it was nominated.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.900
Was it for both awards? I know it was for at least one of them.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.560
It came in third for the Nebulon. It came in third for the Hugo.

22:10.460 --> 22:16.060
Surely that must have helped give you a boost, just a middle boost for your first novel to do that well.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.640
Well, I guess I know. I thought it worked. But that was the publisher.

22:21.260 --> 22:24.420
That was Valentine Books. They gave me dishonest reports.

22:25.600 --> 22:33.160
I was paid $1,500 for that novel, and it had sales in England and in France and in Holland,

22:33.480 --> 22:37.000
and they showed me that the novel was far from earning out its advance.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.920
Well, now money was worth more in those days than now.

22:41.320 --> 22:46.540
But these days, for the last novel I had in the first two months of publication, it earned out $18,000.

22:46.540 --> 22:51.040
I don't think I've changed that much. They were not giving me honest statements,

22:51.180 --> 22:56.100
and I got the evidence to prove it. I got the money, but I also got blacklisted.

22:56.480 --> 23:00.920
So I never had accurate statistics on how well that did. It may have done well,

23:01.120 --> 23:06.680
but the sales statistics I got showed that it sold maybe 45,000 copies and went dead.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.240
I don't believe them, but that's all the evidence I have.

23:12.500 --> 23:17.740
Then in the next years after the phone, you wrote, I guess, the Battle Circle novels,

23:17.920 --> 23:20.760
where the next ones are at least the first couple of those. Is that correct?

23:21.800 --> 23:26.180
Yes. The order I wrote them and the order they're published are not necessarily the same.

23:26.820 --> 23:32.920
The first of the Battle Circle novels was Social The Rope, and that was done so I could enter a contest.

23:33.240 --> 23:38.520
Pyramid had this $5,000 contest. Good money in those days. I entered this novel, and it was.

23:40.460 --> 23:45.060
Then later on, I did a sequel to it, and Pyramid bounced it.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.900
They wrote me this fancy letter saying,

23:46.980 --> 23:51.040
we wish we could tell you how much we like this novel and that we want to publish it, but we don't.

23:51.320 --> 23:56.680
Then they sent it back. It had to be published by a different publisher,

23:56.980 --> 24:00.940
who then rejected the third novel in the series. That was Bantam.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.380
So three novels, there, finally, Avon got them, put them all together,

24:06.380 --> 24:08.400
and it's been pretty successful ever since.

24:09.100 --> 24:13.600
And Nick the Sword never was published by himself in the state, was it?

24:13.620 --> 24:19.020
It was, but it was in England, never in this country. Bantam Books bought it and wrote it off.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.980
Do you know what I mean by writing it off?

24:24.060 --> 24:24.420
Right.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.820
They bought it, they paid for it, and they refused to publish it.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.380
It was too violent for them. It was a violent novel,

24:31.380 --> 24:37.080
but I wish they'd paid attention to this name, which was vengeance and the futility of vengeance.

24:37.200 --> 24:42.860
I had something to say about vengeance there, and I feel I did a good job at showing what it's like.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.500
If you live a life that's based on vengeance, this is what it's going to be like.

24:47.660 --> 24:51.920
But nobody ever commented on it. I never got any fan letters. Nobody ever understood that.

24:52.740 --> 24:56.940
And the publisher, having bought it, had to change a better version and wrote it off.

24:56.940 --> 25:00.700
And so I'm glad that Avon finally did put it into print.

25:03.420 --> 25:07.960
Macroscope, you feel, was your, oh, say, your first crowning achievement,

25:08.060 --> 25:10.160
where you thought you had learned to write novels finally?

25:11.200 --> 25:13.700
Yes, so after that I was confident that I could do it.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.420
It was 190,000 words long, and so that I could do that, I could do any length.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.660
And I felt it was the major novel of my career until I did Tarot.

25:22.220 --> 25:26.520
I still regarded the second major novel and have done it.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.580
Did you get fan mail on Macroscope or continue to?

25:30.880 --> 25:35.780
Yes, I've had quite a bit over the years. Many people have written to admire it.

25:36.080 --> 25:44.380
Of course, Macroscope had a problem. I thought that if novels like Stone were placing third on the Hugo and Nebula,

25:45.040 --> 25:49.140
what would a novel like Macroscope, which I regard as a much more important work,

25:49.880 --> 25:51.860
it wasn't permitted on the ballot at all.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.300
It wasn't permitted on the ballot?

25:55.420 --> 25:56.840
Yes, I had a lot of trouble.

26:00.160 --> 26:05.940
The publishers would distribute novels to the Science Fiction Writers of America, SFWA.

26:07.560 --> 26:13.960
And I got my publisher Avon to agree to distribute this novel to them so that people could read it.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.960
The membership were expecting the novel to be distributed.

26:17.980 --> 26:27.040
The publisher followed up and sent out the novel so that it arrived about a month after the nominations ballot had closed.

26:27.940 --> 26:30.940
I got several letters from people saying, look, I know this is a great novel.

26:31.140 --> 26:33.840
I'll probably read it and might get nominated. But where is it?

26:34.860 --> 26:38.420
Well, the publisher had not distributed it.

26:40.000 --> 26:48.540
So that I then wrote to the president, SFWA, who was Gordon Dixon, and said, look,

26:48.880 --> 26:52.920
I believe that I've written a major novel of my career. My other ones have been placing high.

26:53.060 --> 26:58.020
I feel that if this novel were given a fair chance to be nominated, it would make the ballot.

26:58.820 --> 27:07.040
So it wasn't your fault, but it didn't. But will you permit writing a vote on the ballot since the ballot was closed?

27:07.040 --> 27:16.080
And he wrote back and said no. So I think had they been... See, once it was distributed, people could read it and nominate it,

27:16.120 --> 27:21.760
but the nominations were closed. So if a write-in had been permitted, I think it could have made the ballot.

27:22.620 --> 27:30.360
But Gordon Dixon refused to allow a write-in. And so it was not permitted to compete. And that's it.

27:30.360 --> 27:36.060
It went nowhere. The major novel of the first decade of my writing existence.

27:37.400 --> 27:47.020
It did make the Hugo ballot. It came in third on the Hugo. The problem there is that for about ten years,

27:47.880 --> 27:54.040
the winner of the Nebula ballot was almost automatically the winner of the Hugo.

27:54.780 --> 27:58.500
And mine was not even on the Nebula ballot. So a lot of people didn't bother to read it.

27:59.020 --> 28:05.660
I'm pleased that it did come up from nowhere. It was the only novel that made the Hugo ballot that hadn't been on the Nebula ballot.

28:06.360 --> 28:14.720
So it's like, you know, if you were in a race and everybody else took off, and you came in, you know, two minutes later on this hundred-yard dash,

28:14.840 --> 28:19.060
and you had to start to compete, if you get through you're even in place, you're doing pretty well.

28:19.640 --> 28:28.860
So I feel that the novel did pretty well considering, and the SFWA published what amounted to an apology for it.

28:28.860 --> 28:36.940
Later on they had their collection of Nebula Award winners discuss the novels in them, discuss all the novels on the ballot, plus one.

28:37.200 --> 28:42.100
That is plus a microscope, more or less apologetically, trying to explain why it wasn't on the ballot.

28:43.760 --> 28:53.340
And that was it. I was not pleased. I thought that they should have permitted a writing ballot so that my novel had a chance at least to compete, but they did not.

28:56.680 --> 29:05.560
Okay. We'll ask you one last question then. Why do you use the nom de plume, Piers Anthony, instead of your real last name?

29:05.560 --> 29:17.000
Okay. I decided on that before I ever sold a thing, and I said, supposing I write, and just supposing I'm successful, and just supposing I get to be famous.

29:17.440 --> 29:25.020
Oh, this was an awful lot of supposing. I mean, I didn't even sold anything. I'd been trying for several years and had...

29:25.540 --> 29:35.420
I've heard about writers, such as John D. McDonald, a mystery writer, and he had to move several times because people would come in and just drop in.

29:35.500 --> 29:43.420
They would assume that he had nothing better to do than to talk with every fan that dropped in on his address. And so he would have to move so his address would be lost.

29:43.500 --> 29:53.500
It would take him two or three years to find him, and then they'd take up his time again. Why have this happened to me? If I ever get that well known, the answer was to use the pin name.

29:54.480 --> 30:05.680
So I set up with the pin name from the outset, and it has protected me. I get a lot of fan mail. It goes through the publisher. I don't get many people dropping in on me because they can't find me.

30:05.920 --> 30:13.740
They can look up in the phone book. I don't know, maybe there's somebody locally called Anthony that keeps getting people dropping in on him. It's not me, you see.

30:14.700 --> 30:25.380
So I have protected myself. If I want someone to know who I am, I can tell them. But the stranger that just says, hey, gee, there's this writer. I think I'll drop in on him. He is unable to find me.

30:25.900 --> 30:36.840
And so now I'm beginning to approach the sort of success that the pseudonym was prepared for. I really never thought I would get there. I was just saying, suppose.

30:37.640 --> 30:47.220
And I planned well. I'm having more success than I really believed I would have. And now my pin name is serving to protect me, to protect my time, really.

30:47.740 --> 30:56.400
It's not that I'm not talking with people, but you know, there will be a lot of people that would just like to come. If there's a writer there, they won't even have read anything by that author.

30:56.540 --> 31:00.280
They say, gee, that's a writer. I'll go talk to them. But I don't need that sort of thing.

31:00.280 --> 31:08.320
I'm willing to talk to people that have read my works, that want to talk to me, ask me intelligent questions, that people more like you, you see.

31:08.820 --> 31:16.860
I'm not willing to talk to the man off the street. We just has heard that I'm a writer. He doesn't even know what I'm writing about.

31:17.420 --> 31:27.140
But just if there's a writer, he just wants to go and talk to him and take up his time. So that's the reason. Again, a rather commercial reason, if you will.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.240
But I think it's effective.

31:33.460 --> 31:42.920
Well, I'm very glad that your plans, your carefully worked out plans were worth it. That's nice.

31:43.100 --> 31:47.320
I hope that sounds so negative. But actually, now I do need to protect my time.

31:48.460 --> 31:54.900
Of course. Well, sir, we appreciate the time you spent with us. It's been very enlightening.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.800
I hope you can digest it down.

31:59.220 --> 32:03.840
I'm not talking here, which is the danger. You may have trouble getting it down to your five minute segment.

32:04.360 --> 32:12.420
Well, that's going to be the hard part. But again, it's much easier to have to cut. That sort of thing that it is to try to stretch.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.660
It's in limits, I suppose. Yes, no, it wouldn't be a very good answer.

32:16.660 --> 32:29.260
No, some people just are a little bit more reticent. Some of the people that we talk to are actually a little bit shy, which I can understand and are not confident that their answers are.

32:29.360 --> 32:35.520
I'm an English teacher. I've been in front of classes and so on, so that's not a problem.

32:37.280 --> 32:42.020
Okay, great. Well, we sure look forward to whatever else you put out.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.680
I hope it works out and I hope that your listeners like it.

32:45.680 --> 32:54.200
Great. We sure appreciate your talking to us and we'll get you copies of the programs. I imagine it'll be about a month and a half or so, but we will get them to you.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.540
And thanks again. Enjoyed it very much. Okay, good night now.
