00:02.000 --> 00:04.160
My courage to gather and went down through a meeting.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.080
Are you ready to go?

00:06.440 --> 00:06.540
Yeah.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.060
Okay, the tape is rolling.

00:08.660 --> 00:08.800
Good.

00:09.500 --> 00:15.040
The first thing I wanted to ask you, Mr. Bradbury, the back in Los Angeles when you connected

00:15.040 --> 00:18.780
with that science fiction group that I've read about, the other group with Williamson

00:18.780 --> 00:22.440
and Heinlein and so forth, how did you get involved with them and what kind of influence

00:22.440 --> 00:23.420
do they have on you, if any?

00:23.840 --> 00:29.320
Well, Bruce Yerke, who was the secretary for the Science Fantasy Society, wrote me a letter

00:29.320 --> 00:31.240
in October of 1937.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.320
That was my last year in high school.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.700
They invited me to come down to Clifton's cafeteria and meet the group.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.600
And I was very shy and a little fearful.

00:41.780 --> 00:42.560
I didn't know anyone.

00:43.100 --> 00:48.460
But nevertheless, I got my courage to gather and went down through a meeting.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.200
And that was my first encounter with Forrest Ackerman, who became my first editor.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.900
He was editing a magazine called Imagination.

00:56.900 --> 01:03.340
And then along over the next year or so, I met Henry Kupner, Arthur Barnes, Lee Brackett,

01:03.500 --> 01:07.860
Robert Heinlein, Jack Williamson, Ross Rockland, Henry Hasse.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.140
They all became friends.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.480
And in one way or another, influenced me.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.020
We were very close.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.300
And I was beginning to write a lot of very bad science fiction, very bad fantasy.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.900
I still haven't learned to write well.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.740
But these people were very patient with me.

01:24.740 --> 01:33.000
And especially, I remember Robert Heinlein and his wonderful wife, who invited me up

01:33.000 --> 01:34.160
to their home on occasion.

01:34.600 --> 01:39.440
I got to read a lot of his manuscripts before they were published.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.620
He was just starting to write.

01:41.360 --> 01:50.740
He came to a meeting at the Science Fantasy Club in, I believe it was 19, early 30, 38

01:50.740 --> 01:51.420
or 39.

01:52.020 --> 01:56.020
He had just written his first story and sold it to a founding science fiction.

01:56.620 --> 02:00.580
So he was a beginner, just as I was, except he was about 11 years older.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.520
He was around, I would say, 31.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.680
And I think I was 19 when I met him.

02:05.480 --> 02:12.120
So it was that kind of situation where you had personal contact with writers who were

02:12.120 --> 02:14.840
already established or were establishing themselves.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.460
And of course, it changed my life forever because I had acceptance.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.700
People were willing to put up with me and read my terrible stories.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.620
You are a self-taught writer, though, are you not?

02:28.040 --> 02:29.320
Well, I guess you can say that.

02:30.420 --> 02:33.680
Most writing, almost every art form, is self-teaching.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.560
Except what you need around the edges is shortcut.

02:37.900 --> 02:44.600
If people can help you by recommending certain books, either books on writing or books which

02:44.600 --> 02:47.600
give you examples of excellent writing.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.640
I remember Henry Kutner was always calling Lee Brackett up or calling me up and saying,

02:52.660 --> 02:54.320
hey, have you read Captain Adam Porter?

02:54.880 --> 02:56.420
You know the work of John Collier.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.420
What about Yudor Welty?

02:58.620 --> 03:04.780
Well, this kind of shortcut is so important that you break away from your own field and

03:04.780 --> 03:10.360
move on out into the white culture and bring back into the science fiction and the fantasy

03:10.360 --> 03:16.740
field influences from people like Kipling or a Somerset mom or John Collier.

03:16.740 --> 03:21.720
So that's where having a good teacher is important.

03:22.680 --> 03:28.200
Not that they teach you all that much or that intensely, but the fact that they care about

03:28.200 --> 03:34.440
you at all is very good for your sense of malnutrition.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.560
We all feel as if we haven't set ourselves well enough to mirror that age.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.840
Okay, give us about a second.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.100
David has to make a change on the one.

03:44.100 --> 03:44.680
Okay, we did it.

03:47.180 --> 03:51.660
Okay, listen, I'm sure you've answered this question many times before, but I think I know

03:51.660 --> 03:52.300
what your answer is.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.760
But you've obviously been accepted by the so-called mainstream audience and you've sort of broken

03:56.760 --> 04:00.940
out of the area of science fiction where you're typed as a specific kind of writer.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.220
How did you make that switch?

04:02.860 --> 04:06.040
Well, you just automatically think about it for a lifetime.

04:06.420 --> 04:13.280
I always dreamt of being number one, a writer, not a writer of science fiction or a writer

04:13.280 --> 04:14.880
of fantasy, but a writer period.

04:14.880 --> 04:21.560
I had huge heroes that I looked up to in the world, people like Shakespeare and a lot of

04:21.560 --> 04:25.860
the great poets, Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost when I was in 19th.

04:26.340 --> 04:31.480
And then as I got older and began to see the world of the theater around me more, I wanted

04:31.480 --> 04:32.640
to do theater work.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.580
I loved motion pictures.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.280
I knew that eventually I wanted to do some films.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.680
So my interests were always very Catholic, very broad.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.980
And it was only a matter of time before I would experiment with each of these things.

04:45.380 --> 04:51.680
And at the same time, I was writing and having my first success in selling stories to Weirdtales.

04:52.040 --> 04:58.660
I was beginning to write short stories in the larger fields, stories about racial relationships

04:58.660 --> 05:01.880
or stories about travel inside America.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.280
A little bit of everything I was experimenting with.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.920
But it took me until I was around 25.

05:09.360 --> 05:15.760
A friend of mine called me on the phone that he was going to Mexico to travel for two months.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.980
Did I want to come along?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.520
Well, I thought I can't.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.280
I don't have any money.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.500
I was still only making around $20 a week selling stories to Weirdtales.

05:25.120 --> 05:31.880
I usually sold six stories to Weirdtales every year, which gave me around $120 for the whole year.

05:32.460 --> 05:36.620
And then I sold an occasional murder mystery and a few science fiction stories.

05:36.700 --> 05:41.540
So my income at the time was around $2,500 a year if I was lucky.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.660
And he said, oh, you're such a coward.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.700
He said, here the war is over.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.720
War has been over in Europe a month or so.

05:50.420 --> 05:54.800
You should travel and you're afraid to send out your short story.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.020
You're afraid of being rejected.

05:56.580 --> 06:03.660
I know you've got a lot of excellent broad literary middle stream fictions.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.960
I'm actually retype them and send them out.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.280
So by God, he egged me on and I got three short stories out of my files.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.020
I retype them, put an assumed name on each one, William Elliott.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.960
I mailed them off without an agent, without any representation,

06:19.280 --> 06:23.020
with not even a letter from myself to the editors.

06:23.020 --> 06:28.320
And one story to Charm, one story to Madame Azale, and another one to Collier's.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.440
Well, all three stories sold within three days of each other.

06:31.920 --> 06:38.120
One story sold on August 19th to Charm on the 20th, one to Madame Azale.

06:38.220 --> 06:43.020
And on my birthday, the 22nd of August, I sold my first short story to Collier's.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.280
So all of a sudden I had an aggregate of $1,000, which arrived in the mail.

06:48.280 --> 06:56.820
Well, $1,000 back in 1945 would be like getting $15,000 in the mail today.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.420
I was out of my head.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.280
I couldn't believe it.

06:59.620 --> 07:04.760
So without money, I picked up and went to Mexico with him for six weeks where I had

07:04.760 --> 07:09.080
a whole series of adventures that scared the hell out of me and caused me to write

07:09.080 --> 07:11.960
some of my best weird stories when I came home.

07:12.540 --> 07:16.880
So that's the way I made the transition, because someone called me a coward and

07:16.880 --> 07:18.560
dared me to send my stories out.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.320
OK, fine.

07:22.340 --> 07:28.040
In much of your work, I've read interviews given that you have given to people too.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.860
And I've heard you say this and I pick it up from your work too, that oftentimes you

07:30.860 --> 07:34.940
seem to have a mistrust, maybe of technology and the intellect.

07:35.340 --> 07:38.620
And I wondered how you can be so committed to the space program with with.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.760
Well, that's a misinterpretation.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.180
It's never been true.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.840
I've never mistrusted technologies.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.920
Only people have a big difference there.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.860
It's the way we use the automobile, for instance.

07:50.060 --> 07:54.920
There's nothing wrong with cars that having more safe drivers won't won't change.

07:55.320 --> 08:01.600
If I had my way, I would pass a lot of miles to eliminate every every male driver in

08:01.600 --> 08:06.580
the country, because it's mainly men who do all the killing and it's men who raise

08:06.580 --> 08:11.600
the insurance rate, especially young men between the ages of 18 and 22.

08:11.740 --> 08:12.640
They're the real killers.

08:13.220 --> 08:20.700
So if we pass laws eliminating all young men drivers from our society, we could save 30

08:20.700 --> 08:22.280
or 40,000 lives a year.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.560
Let the girls do the driving.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.660
Let the women do it because they're calmer.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.740
They're quieter.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.140
They're not maniacal.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.360
They're not trying to prove anything.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.600
So what I'm afraid of is people and specific areas.

08:35.300 --> 08:41.940
Now, when it comes to computers, space travel, IBM's electric type.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.120
That's what I'm afraid of is these are all beautiful.

08:43.460 --> 08:44.280
We're using them well.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.060
And the future is very exciting because of it.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.740
Now, I've tried to pick those technologies that I criticized.

08:53.440 --> 08:58.320
For instance, there was a certain moment in history in Los Angeles where they were

08:58.320 --> 09:03.100
threatening to put Muzak on our, with advertising on our buses.

09:03.540 --> 09:08.380
And I immediately mounted a campaign with some friends, thousands of people who said,

09:08.380 --> 09:09.280
oh, no, you don't.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.060
Bad enough, we have all these posters all over the place.

09:12.280 --> 09:17.100
But to trap us on buses, then make us listen to music we don't want to hear or

09:17.100 --> 09:18.940
advertisements we don't want to hear.

09:19.480 --> 09:26.360
So I'm anti the way that particular technology was going to be used.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.460
And I'm anti intellect when intellectual, when it gets in the way of creativity.

09:33.300 --> 09:39.400
People who pretend to be intelligent at times, try to tell me a creator and a

09:39.400 --> 09:41.000
certain field ought to create.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.400
Well, those intellectuals are dangerous.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.540
Because they're telling me my business and I know it better than they do.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.900
So I'm not afraid of intellectuals when they behave.

09:51.320 --> 09:56.760
It's only when they get some mad idea in their head and become insane with the

09:56.760 --> 09:58.400
idea where they become a danger.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.600
Okay, good.

10:02.620 --> 10:06.120
I know you've been involved in various aspects of the space program before

10:06.120 --> 10:07.580
committees and all sorts of things.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.440
Do you have any involvements right now that you're connected with?

10:10.700 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, I'm trying to build a space museum here in Los Angeles and various other

10:16.000 --> 10:17.680
groups are building similar things.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.920
So where I somewhere along the line, I'm going to help or I'm going to lead or

10:21.920 --> 10:22.720
I'm going to do something.

10:23.300 --> 10:28.920
I want to, I've been working with a Smithsonian institution in Washington on

10:28.920 --> 10:30.000
a couple of projects.

10:31.060 --> 10:37.360
One, I hope to write a program, a special entertaining program for the

10:37.360 --> 10:40.460
planetarium there, the National Air and Space Museum.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.940
I don't know if that's ever going to come off or not.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.600
I've done one preliminary sketch for them.

10:47.220 --> 10:50.820
I've been working off and on with the planetarium in Los Angeles.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.400
I'd like to do more programs for them.

10:54.120 --> 11:01.820
And I'm starting work right now on a grand opera, a science fiction grand

11:01.820 --> 11:06.120
opera for the Seattle Opera Company based on the Moby Dick mythology.

11:06.740 --> 11:12.060
And I wrote a play several years ago called Leviathan 99, about a great

11:12.060 --> 11:15.300
white comet coming down through the universe once every 40 years.

11:15.460 --> 11:20.200
And this blind space captain goes out to attack the comet that put out his eyes

11:20.200 --> 11:21.620
when he was a young astronaut.

11:21.620 --> 11:26.840
So you have the basic mythology of Herman Melville and Moby Dick, but

11:26.840 --> 11:31.460
transferred over into the space age with spaceships instead of whaling ships,

11:31.640 --> 11:34.060
a great white comet instead of a great white whale.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.220
And the language, of course, of the play is mine.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.500
And, uh, but the whole thing is dedicated to the memory of Herman Melville.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.540
So I'll be working on that.

11:46.780 --> 11:51.320
And then in several months, I'll be going down to Disney World, to the

11:51.320 --> 11:57.620
opening of Epcot, which is a world's fair of the future, a permanent one,

11:57.920 --> 11:59.460
which is what Walt Disney always wanted.

11:59.720 --> 12:04.960
And at the center of that permanent world's fair, Epcot is the building

12:04.960 --> 12:06.060
called Spaceship Earth.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.400
And I wrote the basic scenario for the interior of that building.

12:10.180 --> 12:14.460
A dramatization of ideas covering a hundred thousand years of human history,

12:14.780 --> 12:19.380
going into the deep past, coming ahead into the present and blasting off into the

12:19.380 --> 12:19.760
future.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.140
So I have a lot of irons in the fire right now.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.280
Things that I hope will change our future all.

12:26.960 --> 12:32.480
Okay, I'm going to have to follow up on that question, on that comment about the

12:32.480 --> 12:33.080
grand opera.

12:33.460 --> 12:38.220
Is that going to be a, okay, you're going to adapt the opera from your play?

12:39.660 --> 12:40.040
Okay.

12:40.300 --> 12:46.160
Is that going to be a, from the way you explained that, is that a, a parody, a

12:46.160 --> 12:47.800
serious work, or what's the tone?

12:50.580 --> 12:51.140
Okay.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.380
Do you think science fiction can be translated into that sort of medium successfully?

12:56.580 --> 12:56.820
Absolutely.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.720
We've, we've, uh, after all, we've, we've done so many things in the past.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.380
Uh, look at all the different kinds of science fiction films we've made.

13:06.860 --> 13:11.440
Uh, high, low, uh, bright, dumb in between.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.540
You name it, all kinds of things.

13:14.380 --> 13:19.080
There's no reason why, uh, there is one science fiction opera in the

13:19.080 --> 13:23.800
existence already called Aniara, a Swedish opera, which premiered about 20 years

13:23.800 --> 13:27.700
ago, but it's, it's electronic and it's 12 tone, as I recall.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.600
Uh, it's not much fun to listen to.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.680
It's pretty monotonous.

13:31.920 --> 13:37.160
And I thought it was time for someone else to try yet another opera and see if

13:37.160 --> 13:38.280
this time it wouldn't work.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.500
Okay.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.300
I'll sure be interested when that one comes out.

13:43.060 --> 13:46.880
Um, let me just ask one more general question of this nature.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.700
Uh, again, it's an obvious question, but still it's a big one too.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.640
But, uh, why does, why do you think space holds such a romantic interest for mankind,

13:54.880 --> 13:55.740
space and space travel?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.580
Well, I don't know if it's a romantic interest.

13:58.740 --> 14:03.520
I think it starts as romance and then turns into something called survival.

14:03.780 --> 14:07.080
In other words, we don't want to stay here on this planet.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.780
This is our seatbed planet.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.600
And those of us with any sense of the destiny of mankind, whatever that is,

14:15.240 --> 14:21.840
look to space to, to put our seed on other worlds and then move us on out into

14:21.840 --> 14:26.960
the universe so that the cognition of the universe continues so that we gain some

14:26.960 --> 14:28.360
measure of immortality.

14:28.660 --> 14:35.000
What's the use of, of having a Shakespeare or a George Bernard Shaw or the, the

14:35.000 --> 14:39.080
beautiful paintings of the world or the great films or the fantastic book?

14:39.540 --> 14:43.900
If everything's going to be lost when our world freezes or our world burns, if the

14:43.900 --> 14:44.740
sun should explode.

14:44.980 --> 14:52.740
So space travel is a very practical endeavor made by we human beings to ensure

14:52.740 --> 14:56.040
the fact that we'll go on living for several million years.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.720
It's a very practical exercise.

14:59.540 --> 15:00.020
Okay.

15:00.100 --> 15:00.920
That's an excellent answer.

15:01.160 --> 15:01.380
Thank you.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.940
Um, let me hit a high, just a few high points of some of your works.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.400
Um, something wicked this way come.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.940
Did you have a particular inspiration for that story or impetus behind it?

15:11.940 --> 15:12.660
Not really.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.260
It all started a long time ago.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.740
I wrote a short story for weird tales called the black ferris.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.340
So, and I've always been in love with carnivals and circuses and illustrated

15:22.340 --> 15:26.600
men and wars and pickies and you name it.

15:27.340 --> 15:33.860
So over the years, all this material accumulated in one night, about 24 years ago,

15:34.040 --> 15:38.760
Jean Kelly invited me over to MGM studios here to see a new film of his called

15:38.760 --> 15:39.880
Invitations of the Dance.

15:40.060 --> 15:47.380
And part of that film is a sort of dance ballet concerned with a clown, a carnival

15:47.380 --> 15:53.400
sort of material that lawn cheney senior once did 60 years ago in American film.

15:53.660 --> 16:01.880
He did a lot of films about circuses and, uh, uh, armless, legless performers, all

16:01.880 --> 16:06.960
kinds of road tests that he worked with and pretended to imitate.

16:07.660 --> 16:12.880
So I came out of the screening of Jean Kelly's film and walked home with my wife

16:12.880 --> 16:17.140
and lamenting all the way the fact that I'd never worked for Kelly and wanting

16:17.140 --> 16:18.340
very much to do so.

16:18.860 --> 16:23.500
So I got home and I rummaged through all my material to find something to send

16:23.500 --> 16:29.200
to Jean Kelly and I found the black ferris and I took several weeks to write it

16:29.200 --> 16:35.120
into a longer 70 page screen adaptation, uh, treatment outline.

16:35.620 --> 16:40.640
And I took it to Kelly and he immediately said, my God, I must direct this.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.700
Well, can I have an option on it?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.660
I'll take it to Europe and try to get some money.

16:45.340 --> 16:49.180
He went to Europe for a number of weeks and months and finally returned and said,

16:49.280 --> 16:49.880
it's no use.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.920
Nobody wants to put up any money for this.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.500
Thanks very much.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.440
And so long.

16:55.100 --> 16:59.380
Well, I was heartbroken because I wanted to work for Kelly and I said to heck with

16:59.380 --> 17:04.340
it, I sat down and I wrote the long screen treatment into a novel.

17:04.340 --> 17:11.120
Took me about two years and the novel was published in the late summer of 1962,

17:11.540 --> 17:12.440
20 years ago.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.380
And then over the years since I've done four or five other versions of it as

17:17.380 --> 17:24.160
screenplays and now finally at the end of this year, the final product, the film

17:24.160 --> 17:29.780
based on the book based on my new screenplay will be out in the theaters with Jason

17:29.780 --> 17:33.560
Robards and Jonathan Price from the Royal Shakespeare Theater.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.860
Do you have a hand in the actual making of that movie?

17:37.000 --> 17:37.400
Absolutely.

17:37.720 --> 17:42.200
I did the screenplay and now I'm helping with the editing of the film.

17:42.620 --> 17:47.320
I'm going in and sitting with my director with the heads of the studio making

17:47.320 --> 17:53.020
suggestions about certain sound effects indicating where I think maybe we don't

17:53.020 --> 17:55.340
have enough music or the music isn't a lot enough.

17:55.340 --> 18:02.620
These little subtle tunings of a film that occur in the last month of the process

18:02.620 --> 18:05.360
before the film is in its final form.

18:06.160 --> 18:11.060
And so far people are listening to me and I must say I'm having a good relationship

18:11.060 --> 18:13.100
with the director in the studio.

18:13.480 --> 18:20.820
They care about the project and I make whole pages of notes and turn them in.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.200
And now in the next few weeks we'll finish the job.

18:25.340 --> 18:27.060
Good, yeah, I know that was being made into a movie.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.200
We're looking forward to that.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.100
Um, so am I.

18:30.220 --> 18:33.200
Listen, I was going to ask one more question on that book and some of your other

18:33.200 --> 18:38.420
stories. You often use carnival material as I guess a symbol of evil or something.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.160
I wondered why you did that.

18:41.480 --> 18:45.300
I think most of us are uncomfortable around carnivals and circuses.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.460
You sense that the people who run them are evil people.

18:48.660 --> 18:52.000
There is something wrong with most carnival people.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.440
The workers, it's a very tough life.

18:55.740 --> 18:56.980
It's a rough existence.

18:58.020 --> 19:04.520
And it's run by a bunch of tramps and vagabonds and people who go from town to town.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.400
They have no roots.

19:06.540 --> 19:10.800
And I should imagine there's a lot that goes on beyond the behind the scenes.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.040
We can't even guess that.

19:12.980 --> 19:16.780
Not that there isn't a hierarchy there in a big circus, of course there is.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.360
And the people at the top of the hierarchy are the trapeze people.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.260
They are the royal family.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.780
And then you go downwards through the various levels of performers,

19:26.180 --> 19:28.360
depending on their athletic powers.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.680
But it's a very difficult life.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.740
And, um, it's a miracle if most of these people make it through and keep their sanity.

19:36.380 --> 19:40.560
So when you're a child, you sense, especially in the city, the little carnival

19:40.980 --> 19:48.080
that come to visit your hometown, you sense the uneasiness, the

19:48.880 --> 19:54.780
sly life, the sense of evil behind the scenes in these people.

19:55.140 --> 19:59.740
I suppose that's where my my fictions came from.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.740
OK, let me move for just a second to the Martian Chronicles.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.340
Did you gather those stories together after they'd all been written and published elsewhere?

20:08.620 --> 20:10.160
Or did you really aim at one volume?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.100
No, I didn't know what I was doing.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.420
That's the best way to do things.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.640
Just do them and then wake up some morning and discover you've got a book.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.720
I went to New York City in June of 1949.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.900
My wife was pregnant with our first child.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.040
We had about $80 in the bank and I took the Greyhound bus to New York

20:29.040 --> 20:30.880
and I took all my short stories with me.

20:31.280 --> 20:37.220
Oh, 80 or 90, 100 short stories, hoping to sell one or two collections of stories

20:37.660 --> 20:38.560
to some publisher.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.800
Well, I had meetings with various people at Simon & Schuster and Doubleday.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.500
And they all said, look, we don't publish short stories.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.420
Nobody buys them.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.800
Nobody carries them.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.500
And then one night I had dinner with Walter Bradbury at Doubleday.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.580
No relation to me.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.680
A wonderful gentleman, very bright gentleman.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.240
And sitting there at dinner that night, he said, Ray, what about all those Martian stories?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.980
Isn't there a novel there?

21:04.120 --> 21:06.680
Isn't there some way of hanging them all together?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.440
It seems to me there's a common thread.

21:08.880 --> 21:15.500
I said, oh my God, you know, years ago I made notes about doing a series of Chronicles.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.020
And then threw the notes somewhere and forgot about them.

21:18.260 --> 21:23.880
So my subconscious must have remembered, and along through the years was putting these beads

21:23.880 --> 21:24.960
on a single thread.

21:25.340 --> 21:31.700
I went back to the YMCA that night, sat in my underwear with a hot, hot summer evening,

21:31.900 --> 21:37.020
terribly humid, and finished typing out an outline of a book which I called The Martian

21:37.020 --> 21:40.440
Chronicles, which I then took to Doubleday the next day.

21:40.440 --> 21:45.600
And they promptly bought the novel, plus The Illustrated Man, a collection of stories.

21:46.260 --> 21:54.040
And I left New York City with, again, a fabulous $1,000, $500 for each book, which again,

21:55.320 --> 21:58.820
35 years ago, it was a heck of a lot of money.

21:59.380 --> 22:06.260
And it enabled me and my wife to make it through the next six or seven months and survive over

22:06.260 --> 22:08.700
into the time when our first child was born.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.760
OK, just one sort of a two-part question to end this on The Martian Chronicles.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.560
I suppose then the order of the book was your own, the order of the stories, and if it was,

22:20.240 --> 22:22.880
why did you put the million-year picnic as the final story?

22:23.480 --> 22:25.220
It seemed a proper place to put it.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.780
It seemed a culmination of all the stories.

22:30.340 --> 22:35.680
And that my job in looking at all my stories was to guess where to place each.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.420
And well, some of them, it was very easy.

22:37.420 --> 22:42.340
I did a whole series of stories of first encounters on Mars with various expeditions.

22:42.620 --> 22:48.680
So I knew those automatically had to be up front, along with an imaginary encounter in Illa,

22:49.120 --> 22:52.060
where a woman dreams an invasion of Mars.

22:52.540 --> 22:57.960
We never see the invasion itself of the Earthmen, but we know that secretly it must be there

22:57.960 --> 23:00.880
somewhere that real people got killed by the jealous husband.

23:01.580 --> 23:06.540
And then you go along through all the other encounters and what happens to Mars as a result

23:07.100 --> 23:09.500
of the invasion by Earth people.

23:09.980 --> 23:16.800
And ending with all of your final beats and a brief return to Earth for there will come soft

23:16.800 --> 23:20.000
rains and then the million-year picnic at the end.

23:20.100 --> 23:26.540
It all fell together in roughly two hours in my head at the typewriter that night at the YMCA.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.700
Were you happy with the NBC production of that book?

23:31.940 --> 23:33.260
I most certainly was not.

23:33.260 --> 23:37.020
It was one of the most boring shows ever put on television.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.180
And it's a great shame.

23:39.420 --> 23:41.860
Obviously no one enjoyed doing it.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.020
And the director obviously didn't enjoy it, which is a great shame,

23:46.580 --> 23:49.380
because he should have got out of bed every morning and said,

23:49.620 --> 23:54.860
let's have a ball, let's play, let's jump up and down and scream and yell and get something

23:54.860 --> 23:55.780
out of this material.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.840
But he obviously didn't do that.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.180
So the whole thing is taste at a leaven pace.

24:01.620 --> 24:04.340
And the actors were not directed.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.460
Here and there, there are individual scenes that are quite lovely.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.880
Thank God for that.

24:09.220 --> 24:10.420
There were a few high points.

24:10.660 --> 24:17.100
I think the encounter or the priests between the priests and the Christ figure and the fire

24:17.100 --> 24:19.000
balloons was interestingly done.

24:19.560 --> 24:24.340
And the encounter with Wilder and the Martian late at night when they discuss time travel

24:24.900 --> 24:29.160
and who is alive and who isn't alive and who's down in the city.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.420
I think that worked fine.

24:33.640 --> 24:38.140
But on the whole, it was so boring, it will never be repeated.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.680
You haven't heard anything about it ever coming back, have you?

24:42.620 --> 24:46.920
No, but I might mention that two of us who do the show teach a science fiction fantasy

24:46.920 --> 24:48.100
class here at Odessa College.

24:48.100 --> 24:51.940
And we use snippets from that show that are quite successful pieces from it.

24:52.540 --> 24:56.420
I taped the show all six hours of it and I've never played it since.

24:57.020 --> 24:57.380
Yeah.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.800
In fact, I've taped over most of it, but a friend of mine just arrived and he's yawning here

25:02.800 --> 25:06.880
an indication that he agrees with my estimate of the show.

25:08.660 --> 25:13.540
Yeah, it's a great shame, but I've had better luck this year with two television productions.

25:14.100 --> 25:18.980
With the electric grandmother with Marines Stapleton and any friend of Nicholas Nicolby

25:18.980 --> 25:21.020
is a friend of mine with Fred Quinn.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.940
Those both turned out very well indeed.

25:23.140 --> 25:23.660
Thank God.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.800
Yeah, we thought they did too.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.040
Let me just quickly ask you a couple on Fahrenheit 451.

25:30.460 --> 25:33.040
Was there a particular inspiration for that book or did it just grow?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.420
It was a combination of things.

25:37.980 --> 25:41.760
I'd gotten interested with book burners over a period of time.

25:43.500 --> 25:49.160
And when I wrote the book, it was the beginning of the McCarthy era, the Joseph McCarthy period,

25:49.160 --> 25:53.540
when there was a lot of talk about books being banned.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.620
Not many of them got banned, thank God.

25:56.260 --> 26:03.020
For a brief moment there, I think they took a few American books off of foreign library shelves in

26:03.640 --> 26:07.620
army libraries and then President Eisenhower ordered them all put back on,

26:08.140 --> 26:11.500
which proved what a bright man he was, thank goodness.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.680
But it was during that period that I

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
suppose my subconscious

26:19.340 --> 26:25.620
fermented on all this and said I've got to do a book about my anger about libraries because

26:26.200 --> 26:31.680
libraries is really the place where I was born and raised myself, grew up,

26:32.420 --> 26:34.060
and have lived for a lifetime.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.280
They really are very super special to me.

26:37.020 --> 26:40.980
And I go in bookstores constantly.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.300
I can't stay away from them.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.660
I buy too many books.

26:43.660 --> 26:45.640
I'm compulsive about it.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.940
So the novel wrote itself in nine days.

26:49.260 --> 27:01.040
I went up to UCLA in 1950, and I spent nine days there in the typing room in the basement of the UCLA

27:01.040 --> 27:04.020
library with about 12 students sitting around me.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.220
And I played these dime a half hour typewriter machines.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.460
And I typed the novel on those dime machines.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.680
And I spent around $9.40 typing the novel.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.600
So it's a grand place to write a book like that, isn't it, in the basement of a library?

27:22.080 --> 27:27.100
Yeah. Do you think we're heading in that direction at all?

27:27.500 --> 27:31.460
There are a lot of rumors, but we hear those rumors every year.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.700
And there are always some stupid librarians, some stupid mayor,

27:35.700 --> 27:42.880
or some dumb pressure group in some town somewhere in our country every year for the last 60 years

27:42.880 --> 27:45.460
that want to censor this or censor that.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.620
And then they blow away.

27:46.740 --> 27:47.960
They're just chaffing the wind.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.140
And don't pay any attention to them.

27:50.780 --> 27:53.740
And if they grow giant size, call me on the phone.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.320
I'll come over and kick them in the kishkish.

27:55.720 --> 28:03.020
Okay, listen, I think I know the answer to this too,

28:03.020 --> 28:05.480
but are your short stories written from just inspiration,

28:05.780 --> 28:07.860
or do you have to exercise a kind of discipline on them?

28:07.860 --> 28:10.040
No, no, it's all passion. It's all explosion.

28:10.500 --> 28:14.540
I get up in the morning, throw up in my typewriter at breakfast, and clean up at noon.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.220
So that's the way to write.

28:17.300 --> 28:22.220
It makes for very sticky typewriters, but...

28:22.220 --> 28:24.000
Now, everything has to be fun.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.420
If it isn't fun, it's not going to be any good.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.980
You get an idea and say, God, this is a great idea.

28:28.980 --> 28:31.260
So I try to teach this to my friends,

28:31.860 --> 28:37.060
and teach them just to fall in love and go mad with ideas and get the work done.

28:39.180 --> 28:42.100
Okay, I've read ones where you thought that you would...

28:42.100 --> 28:44.260
If you weren't a writer, you may become a preacher or something.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.280
What did you mean by that?

28:45.520 --> 28:49.120
Well, I could shift... If I had my druthers,

28:49.860 --> 28:53.280
I could shift gears tomorrow and become about seven things.

28:53.360 --> 28:57.120
I'd make a very good preacher, a rabbi, a minister,

28:57.860 --> 29:00.320
a priest. I'd make a wonderful pope.

29:01.200 --> 29:05.260
Go out and pontificate the world, because I care about those ideas.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.960
I'm fascinated with the problems of theology,

29:08.400 --> 29:12.620
or I would make a good teacher in various art fields.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.940
I would make a good artist. I would make a fine actor.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.500
I don't know if I'd be a brilliant one,

29:18.760 --> 29:21.040
but I sure have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.280
I'd make a good book salesman.

29:23.740 --> 29:26.560
I can think of dozens of things.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.940
That I would like to be, that I'll never have a chance to be.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.900
My loves are multitudinous,

29:33.120 --> 29:35.780
and I don't understand people who are not in love.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.540
There's so much. I'd make a good director.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.680
If I had the patience, I wanted to take time.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.520
So there are about eight or nine things that I'd be...

29:47.520 --> 29:50.640
I'd be a good politician, because I care about the future of cities,

29:51.100 --> 29:52.900
and rebuilding them and changing them.

29:52.980 --> 29:54.000
I'd make a good architect.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.360
I do have an education up to a point in architecture and urban planning.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.840
All these are my loves.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.080
Okay, excellent. How are you doing on time now?

30:06.340 --> 30:06.920
Is this getting to the...

30:06.920 --> 30:07.880
I should quit now,

30:07.880 --> 30:11.720
but if you want to call me back in a week and do another half hour...

30:11.720 --> 30:14.680
Yeah, we would. Could we make it maybe near the middle,

30:14.860 --> 30:16.820
or third week in August, something like that?

30:17.320 --> 30:17.960
You going to be around then?

30:18.220 --> 30:19.960
Absolutely. Drop me a note in the meantime.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.200
Yeah. Okay, listen, we sure appreciate your time, Mr. Bury.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.240
And we will give you the tapes when they're edited, obviously.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.600
And we'll be back to you sometime in later August.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.940
All right, swell. Okay?

30:29.220 --> 30:29.620
Bye-bye now.
