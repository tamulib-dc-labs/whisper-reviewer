Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.000
And here are your hosts.

00:42.220 --> 00:49.620
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Science fiction and school, a combination
that's becoming more important all the time. Teachers all over the country are

00:49.620 --> 00:57.040
finding out that science fiction in the classroom is a natural at all levels,
junior high, high school, and college. And there's some pretty clear reasons for

00:57.040 --> 01:03.520
that, too. Some of the most significant literature of our time is science
fiction. It's relevant, it's vital, and it teaches people how to cope with

01:03.520 --> 01:10.720
future shock while entertaining them. One of the strongest college science
fiction programs can be found at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. English

01:10.720 --> 01:17.980
faculty member James Gunn, assisted by colleague Stephen Goldman, runs the
program. Gunn is a science fiction author of Long Standing, whose novels include

01:17.980 --> 01:26.480
The Immortals, The Listeners, The Joymakers, and The Dreamers. We asked Gunn
about science fiction at the University of Kansas. Because of our interest here,

01:26.600 --> 01:35.120
I think I've attracted some graduate students who are interested in the area,
some of whom have gotten degrees, not in science fiction because we don't offer

01:35.120 --> 01:51.400
one, but in science fiction-related areas. I have one graduate student now who's
doing his dissertation on my work, and another one who graduated last year who

01:51.400 --> 02:09.160
did a creative dissertation of a book of science fiction stories. So we have had
that body of graduate students who have taught science fiction classes at the

02:09.160 --> 02:24.020
sophomore level as one of the required courses in composition and literature.
And I also traditionally teach a science fiction course, an undergraduate and

02:24.020 --> 02:33.720
graduate science fiction course each year, although my primary duties in the
English department are the teaching of fiction writing. Every summer, Gunn is

02:33.720 --> 02:37.940
responsible for a unique offering at the University of Kansas. Gunn is
responsible for a unique education, a graduate student, a graduate student, a

02:37.940 --> 02:49.580
graduate student, perhaps our most interesting science fiction offering,
however, is the three-week intensive English Institute on the Teaching of

02:49.580 --> 03:04.740
Science Fiction that we offer in the summer. We realized a number of years ago
that there were a lot of people faced with the task, sometimes self-assumed,

03:04.900 --> 03:18.640
sometimes assigned, of teaching a science fiction course. And they were largely
unprepared because there had been no academic program on science fiction,

03:18.880 --> 03:35.360
certainly not on the teaching of science fiction. So we set up this intensive
three-week workshop to offer teachers the opportunity to attend and get a six

03:35.360 --> 03:49.280
-credit hour program in science fiction, in all aspects of science fiction, in
just three weeks. And it's a very intensive experience. We bring in several

03:49.280 --> 04:02.960
science fiction writers besides myself. This year we're having Gordon Dixon and
Theodore Sturgeon and Frederick Pohl. And it has been a most successful and

04:02.960 --> 04:04.600
satisfying experience.

04:20.740 --> 04:29.080
The dates of the Intensive English Institute on the Teaching of Science Fiction
are July 11th to July 29th. The Institute offers a fascinating opportunity for

04:29.080 --> 04:35.680
teachers of science fiction, on any level, to spend three weeks living and
studying science fiction with people who write it and people who teach it. And

04:35.680 --> 04:42.560
there will be two important events held in conjunction with the Teaching
Institute, the annual meeting of the Science Fiction Research Association, and

04:42.560 --> 04:49.560
the Campbell Award Conference, which will honor the best science fiction novel
of the year. Contact James Gunn at the University of Kansas right away for more

04:49.560 --> 04:53.020
information on the Intensive English Institute on the Teaching of Science
Fiction.

04:59.920 --> 05:07.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.860 --> 05:08.620
Odessa, Texas.

05:19.560 --> 05:37.060
ác änd Typically I

05:37.060 --> 05:37.700
would like to teach at a couple of years. What how to do it do this is? What is
due to teaching at a good level of science fiction is nothing new to Fred

05:37.700 --> 05:37.760
flowing in same ways to read data data? I also think I think the
successfulогgreen is wonderful and if his fortunes, If you forget information

05:37.760 --> 05:37.800
once you can do this,

05:48.140 --> 05:52.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:07.980 --> 06:13.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.400
And here are your hosts.

06:21.460 --> 06:29.580
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. One of the most popular and unique fantasy
authors ever was J.R.R. Tolkien, whose trilogy about hobbits, The Lord of the

06:29.580 --> 06:37.300
Rings, came out of the 1950s. Tolkien has become a phenomenon. His books have
gone through countless printings. There are Tolkien societies and clubs all over

06:37.300 --> 06:44.300
the world. And his Middle Earth has, for many readers, become a place as real as
our own world. There have been four or five Tolkien organizations in this

06:44.300 --> 06:51.800
country, and others scattered all over the world. But most successful is the
British Tolkien Society. The Science Fiction Radio Show spoke with Lester

06:51.800 --> 06:59.160
Simons, the membership secretary of the Tolkien Society, when he came to this
country for a Tolkien moot at the World Science Fiction Convention in Denver. We

06:59.160 --> 07:12.800
asked him to tell us about the Tolkien Society. The Society was founded in
England in 1969 with a very small group of members. The Society has grown

07:12.800 --> 07:28.940
gradually over the years. Various notices in various books, directory listings
and so on. We now have 1,200 members, approximately, in 26 countries throughout

07:28.940 --> 07:39.520
the world. So although we're based in England, I think we have the largest
worldwide spread. One way members of the Tolkien Society correspond among

07:39.520 --> 07:51.060
themselves is through the Society's publications. We have two regular
publications. Amon Hen is approximately bi-monthly. It's a bulletin and a

07:51.060 --> 08:08.340
newsletter, letters of comment from members, short articles, short poems, small
artwork. It's really for immediate consumption, the ephemeral material. And the

08:08.340 --> 08:19.420
other publication is Mallorn, the journal, very much more academic. It comes
out, we hope, twice a year. So sometimes we get a Mallorn and an Amon Hen

08:19.420 --> 08:33.740
together. Mallorn is a larger format. It has longer poems. Sometimes they run to
three pages. Members' own poems. In the Tolkien manner, some of them are

08:33.740 --> 08:50.900
imitations of Tolkien's style. Others are members' own work in their own styles.
Essays, longer book reviews, articles of rather more specific interest. And it

08:50.900 --> 09:01.880
is very much less time-dependent. We asked Simons if there were activities in
fellowship among members. Oh, yes, considerable. Our local groups are called

09:01.880 --> 09:14.720
Smiles, from the Hobbit. A smile is a comfortable Hobbit hole. And we hope that
our members feel as comfortable in our smiles as they would in a Hobbit home. We

09:14.720 --> 09:24.900
have smiles in many countries. In some countries, there just aren't enough
members to get together because they're too widely separated. But in England,

09:24.920 --> 09:39.040
there are smiles all over the country. They run themselves as they wish. Some of
them are very formal. Some have costume. Others don't. Some publish their own

09:39.040 --> 09:52.820
little newsletters with subsequent meeting venues, short reviews, little
artwork. It just depends on what the members in any particular area wish to do.

09:53.620 --> 10:01.000
There are also two national meetings annually for the society. One is a formal
business meeting. The other is the Oxenmoot, held on a weekend in late

10:01.000 --> 10:11.740
September. And it is a weekend where members who otherwise don't normally see
other people come together. Smiles send representative groups. Other societies

10:11.740 --> 10:23.600
send representative groups. This year we should have groups from Stockholm.
There will be a representative from America. There will be groups from all over

10:23.600 --> 10:34.060
the United Kingdom. And it is just a weekend of being in company of Tolkien
people. More about the Tolkien Society on our next show.

10:41.200 --> 10:49.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:49.040 --> 10:49.800
Odessa, Texas.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.520
We'll see you in the next topic. Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay
with us.

11:50.260 --> 11:55.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.860
And here are your hosts.

12:03.940 --> 12:11.280
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. We're speaking with Lester Simons,
membership secretary of the Tolkien Society. The Tolkien Society was founded in

12:11.280 --> 12:20.160
1969 in England and is now a worldwide organization dedicated to the study and
appreciation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. We asked Simons if there were

12:20.160 --> 12:33.040
differences between American and British Tolkien fans. Most definitely. American
fans are very much more exuberant in the way they go about things. We are, well,

12:33.120 --> 12:44.600
some people think we may be a little bit too staid and too formal. It suits,
well, it sounds a little bit high-handed to say so, but it suits our purpose to

12:44.600 --> 12:56.020
be more literary and to keep our costume event down to one a year. If we did
everything in costume, then it might lose some of its interest because that is

12:56.020 --> 13:07.980
not how we were set up. The Swedish societies, of which there are three major
ones, do things in costume. They are specifically organized in a manner very

13:07.980 --> 13:20.200
similar, in fact, to the American SCA. They do the Society for Creative
Anachronism. They do things in costume with weapons and they have guilds. But

13:20.200 --> 13:32.260
they don't publish quite so much as we do. There's room in Tolkien fandom for
all sorts. And it would be a poorer place without either of us. J.R.R. Tolkien's

13:32.260 --> 13:39.580
son and executor, Christopher, has been going through his father's papers and
gathering material for publication. As a result of his efforts, three volumes

13:39.580 --> 13:48.240
have been published. The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and the Letters of J.R
.R. Tolkien. We asked Simons if any more material might be forthcoming. Well,

13:48.240 --> 13:57.920
there is a great deal of linguistic material still to be published. Whether it
will be published as a book of linguistic matters, or whether they will end up

13:57.920 --> 14:12.060
as footnotes in other books, I don't know. There is a great deal of poetry. The
Silmarillion had a remarkable lack of verse, which we are waiting to see. There

14:12.060 --> 14:30.440
may be other tales filling in some gaps in Middle-earth. But all we know is that
the papers sat in box files on a table eight feet long. There is a considerable

14:30.440 --> 14:42.200
amount of material. How much of it is publishable is not known. How much of it
is readable is, again, a matter of debate, because towards the end of his life,

14:42.280 --> 14:51.740
the professor's handwriting became not so much untidy as illegible, and even
Christopher can't read it. Finally, we wondered if there was enough material to

14:51.740 --> 15:02.160
keep the Tolkien Society in existence. Wouldn't it run out of things to do after
a while? Well, there are always new people coming in to the societies. People

15:02.160 --> 15:11.860
discover Middle-earth at all ages. And people will be asking the same sort of
questions, but they'll be asking them in different ways. And as more and more

15:11.860 --> 15:21.600
material gets published, interpretations will vary. I think there will be
sufficient interest. After all, Sherlock Holmes Society has been going for some

15:21.600 --> 15:33.380
time, and there's now no longer any possibility of more Sherlock Holmes stories.
It doesn't seem to worry them at all. And with what we already have of Middle

15:33.380 --> 15:44.840
-earth, we can keep going for a considerable number of years. And, of course, we
mustn't forget that the professor did a lot of pure academic linguistic

15:44.840 --> 15:55.440
material, which is very difficult to find, but extremely worthwhile when you can
find it. And that will keep us going for a very, very long time. Even readers

15:55.440 --> 16:02.540
who don't belong to the Tolkien Club would agree that Tolkien's work is one of
the greatest achievements in the history of imaginative literature. And

16:02.540 --> 16:10.060
Tolkien's Middle-earth is such a fully realized world, and Tolkien went to such
depth in providing background for it, that it does indeed seem unlikely fans

16:10.060 --> 16:11.720
could run out of things to study and share.

16:18.820 --> 16:26.760

17:31.740 --> 17:37.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.300
And here are your hosts.

17:45.260 --> 17:53.520
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. One of the most intricately plotted and
provocative science fiction novels to come out in recent years is Dean Ng's 1981

17:53.520 --> 18:01.280
book, Systemic Shock. It concerns a nuclear war, the third world war, so to
speak, that many people today fear. One of the differences between this

18:01.280 --> 18:08.640
treatment of nuclear war, though, and others on the same topic, is the
incredible wealth of detail that Ng has provided. Systemic Shock is a classic

18:08.640 --> 18:17.340
example of extrapolation. Ng takes all the major countries on Earth, China,
Russia, India, the United States, sets the story in 1996, and shows what could

18:17.340 --> 18:25.120
happen if nuclear war broke out. The novel is so complex in its structure that
it obviously is a result of immense effort. We ask him if it was difficult to

18:25.120 --> 18:37.800
write. Oh, Lord. You've asked a lot of questions that I have to answer yes to,
so you must have really done your homework. Yeah, it took me years to get all

18:37.800 --> 18:55.180
the background for this. Especially with Asian and the Indian subcontinent on
Asia. All of the variables, the socio-geopolitical variables of that book were

18:55.180 --> 19:07.880
enough to drive me crazy. I talked with historians, and in the case of India,
more than any other case, I think, whatever I suggested as a scenario for the

19:07.880 --> 19:19.920
future, every historian that I would talk to would say, oh, no, or every social
scientist, no, this can't happen because X, Y, or Z. Well, if that won't happen,

19:20.020 --> 19:29.980
then how about this? No, no, that can't happen. In short, none of them would
ever be willing to speculate on what's going to happen to India.

19:32.760 --> 19:45.540
And I pretty much had to work that up out of whole cloth. So I had four drawer
file cabinets and, oh, perhaps 500 textbooks by the time I was done putting it

19:45.540 --> 19:54.300
all together. We also asked him if the book reflects a serious effort on his
part to work out what could happen in such a situation. Well, yes, seriously

19:54.300 --> 20:09.520
enough that some of my friends are friends of mine because, as political
scientists or physicists or whatever, they read the book and said, oof, an awful

20:09.520 --> 20:14.500
lot of scholarly

20:14.500 --> 20:28.380
research has gone into this son of a guy, and we would meet somewhere and get to
be good friends. That doesn't say much about the popularity of a book, although

20:28.380 --> 20:42.560
Systemic Shock has been a bestseller, in science fiction terms, anyway. But it
does say a lot about whether or not the work I did is appreciated by experts.

20:43.980 --> 21:00.560
And it does seem to be appreciated by experts. That's the thing that gets to
them the most is that the existing problems of Islam, of India, of how Japan and

21:00.560 --> 21:11.560
China are going to work out, the problems that the United States will have, the
problems that the Soviets will have 20 years from now, etc., that it simply

21:11.560 --> 21:23.060
grips all those bulls by the horns and rustles them all at the same time. We
wondered if Ng was a military strategy buff. Well, in a small way, yes. Well, in

21:23.060 --> 21:37.620
a small way, yes. And Reginald Bretner, who is a... one of the better-known
science fiction writers and... writers about science fiction as well as writers

21:37.620 --> 21:53.340
of science fiction. And Reg has done a book on military strategy. I listen to
him a lot. And, of course, I borrow stuff from his library from time to time.

21:53.700 --> 22:00.140
So, yes, strategy is of some interest to me. We'll talk about Dean Ng's systemic
shock in more detail in our next show.

22:07.180 --> 22:15.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:15.020 --> 22:15.760
Odessa, Texas.

22:26.720 --> 22:36.980
I mean, I don't know what advice

22:36.980 --> 22:44.380

Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:19.140 --> 23:24.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.760
And here are your hosts.

23:33.220 --> 23:40.820
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. We're talking with Dean Ng about his
fascinating 1981 science fiction novel, Systemic Shock. The book is an immensely

23:40.820 --> 23:48.500
detailed scenario of what the world would be like if the Third World War, a
nuclear one, broke out. The protagonist of Systemic Shock is a young man named

23:48.500 --> 23:56.120
Quantro. After the war starts, he becomes a skilled assassin for what's left of
the United States government. Quantro doesn't seem to be cast in the mold of the

23:56.120 --> 24:17.740
stereotyped science fiction hero. Quantro is not a hero. Quantro is a youngster
with some very unusual characteristics. He has abilities that make him very

24:17.740 --> 24:33.140
likely to be useful for assassin jobs and so forth. Does this make him a hero?
Not by any means. For all of his rare abilities, Quantro is also of great

24:33.140 --> 24:51.720
potential to be misused. He could be a great, metaphorically speaking, he could
be an Olympic-type pistol as a tool, or he could be a Saturday night special as

24:51.720 --> 25:03.960
a tool. He could be used well or he could be grossly misused. And Quantro is not
a genius by any means. There are lots and lots of flaws in the young man. And he

25:03.960 --> 25:13.320
is misused, grossly, for quite a while. You can't really very much call a man
like that a hero.

25:16.220 --> 25:27.820
And I didn't. I wanted to show Quantro with all of his foibles and his failures.
A subplot in the book concerns a refugee family trying to survive on the harsh

25:27.820 --> 25:38.300
plateaus of South Texas. When the mother and father die, only a young girl
child, Sandy, is left. Ng has her adopted, sort of, by a huge Russian boar. We

25:38.300 --> 25:53.660
asked Ng the reason behind this episode. It happens to be the opinion of
zoologists and animal husbandry folk that a pig next to a chimpanzee is just

25:53.660 --> 26:11.060
about the most intelligent animal around. And we know that other animals have
adopted human beings, children, babies. When you find that pigs are that smart,

26:11.100 --> 26:28.860
and that they do sometimes really like human beings, then I wondered how likely
it would be that a huge Russian boar might befriend a tiny human being. Now,

26:28.860 --> 26:42.400
it's also true, and you probably know that as well as I, that around Edwards
Plateau there in South Central Texas, there are Russian boars. Big ones. Big

26:42.400 --> 26:57.980
ones. None of them anything like 1,000 pounds. But having studied it, I found
that the biggest Russian boar on record were something like 550 pounds. And a

26:57.980 --> 27:13.280
Russian boar that big would be about the size of, almost the size of a Shetland
pony. So it didn't seem to me so terribly unlikely that an extremely intelligent
