Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.420 --> 00:33.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.120
And here are your hosts.

00:42.600 --> 00:49.960
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Science fiction author Kevin O'Donnell Jr.,
a Yale graduate who still lives in New Haven, started writing short stories in

00:49.960 --> 00:57.760
the early 70s. After writing nearly 100 short stories, O'Donnell moved on to
writing novels, and so far he's written six. These include Bander Snatch,

00:57.920 --> 01:06.680
Mayflies, War of Omission, and the Journeys of McGill Feighan series, Caverns,
Reefs, and Lava. O'Donnell spent a good deal of time in Korea before and after

01:06.680 --> 01:15.080
college, and he majored in Chinese studies at college. We asked him if having
lived in the Orient influences his writing. It hit me on a couple of different

01:15.080 --> 01:26.820
levels. One is, this is more true, I think, of Americans who live in Asia than
those who live in Europe or South America. Because in Asia, you're very

01:26.820 --> 01:36.080
conscious of the fact that you're a foreigner. I mean, you're racially
different. You do not have black hair and dark brown eyes. Everywhere you walk,

01:36.280 --> 01:46.340
people look at you, especially in some of the more rural areas of the country,
like Korea, where the last time they saw an American was during the war, 20

01:46.340 --> 01:59.840
years ago, 20 years before I was there. They are unabashed in their curiosity,
and it really encounters the self-consciousness in the American to constantly be

01:59.840 --> 02:12.180
stared at, to have people touching you, to see if you feel the same as a Korean
does. So I think that's affecting my science fiction writing and how a person

02:12.180 --> 02:25.540
feels when he's among aliens. At the same time, Asian languages and cultures are
significantly different from Western cultures in terms of the way they view

02:25.540 --> 02:38.380
almost everything. And although it's not really an alien psychology, it's
sufficiently different that it gives me sort of an insight into how a sentient

02:38.380 --> 02:52.280
being from Rigel or whatever could view things differently, could take a really
far-out perspective on something we just take for granted.

03:11.980 --> 03:19.700
Mayflies is O'Donnell's second novel. It's the story of a generation ship
conveying thousands of settlers to a far destination. But the focus is on the

03:19.700 --> 03:26.360
computer that guides the ship. You see, its core is a living human brain that
has retained the memories of the time it was in the body of Dr. Gerard

03:26.360 --> 03:35.300
Metaclura. O'Donnell explains the genesis of this concept. Mayflies started out
as, actually

03:35.300 --> 03:50.080
it was a workshop exercise. I was at the time in a workshop here in New Haven.
And we had to do a, oh I forget, a two-paragraph description of someone. And I

03:50.080 --> 04:04.180
described this character, Metaclura, who took more than the two paragraphs to
describe. He ran on for about a page and all of a sudden he died. And I took it

04:04.180 --> 04:11.860
into the workshop and people said, well yes, those are nice paragraphs and very
good description. But boy, what have you done here? You know, you've created a

04:11.860 --> 04:20.000
character and then killed him. What a waste. So I got angry and said, well, you
know, maybe I've killed him but it's not a waste. But I can make something of

04:20.000 --> 04:29.560
him. And they said, we dare you. And pretty soon Metaclura's was underway with
me trying to prove he could write a book about a protagonist who died on page

04:29.560 --> 04:41.740
one. And have that protagonist a very vital part of the entire story rather than
just a haunting memory. The only way to do that was, of course, to somehow keep

04:41.740 --> 04:51.500
him alive. And one thing led to another. And the next thing I knew, Metaclura
was a central computer on the good ship Mayflower. On our next show, we'll talk

04:51.500 --> 04:52.720
more with Kevin O'Donnell Jr.

04:59.800 --> 05:07.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.680 --> 05:11.080
Odessa, Texas.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:13.540 --> 06:18.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.100
And here are your hosts.

06:27.420 --> 06:36.580
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Bander Snatch, science fiction author Kevin
O'Donnell Jr.'s first novel, made its paperback appearance in 1979. The first

06:36.580 --> 06:44.460
half of Bander Snatch depicts a 22nd century America deeply divided between the
haves and the have-nots. A burgeoning bureaucracy strangles the have-nots. In

06:44.460 --> 06:52.200
five of O'Donnell's novels, the protagonist must contend with stultifying
bureaucracies. When we ask O'Donnell if this represents a personal view, this is

06:52.200 --> 07:08.980
what he told us. I really see it happening not only here, but pretty much
everywhere where governments have been in power for any length of time. I think

07:08.980 --> 07:22.580
it's the nature of the beast, a bureaucracy of any sort, whether it's
governmental, corporate, academic. In fact, it achieves a goal beyond its stated

07:22.580 --> 07:38.300
purpose. It acquires a new goal. And that goal is to survive, to perpetuate
itself, to expand, to get fat and strong and secure. It goes all the way back to

07:38.300 --> 07:43.420
Parkinson's Law. Work expands until the time available, and when it has, you
hire two assistants.

07:46.140 --> 08:00.900
I think this is an inevitable trend in any bureaucracy, whether it's Western
-style capitalism or Maoist communism. You know, one of Mao's big campaigns was

08:00.900 --> 08:12.280
against bureaucracy. He was constantly railing against the way that no matter
what he said, no matter what he did, the bureaucracy kept growing, and it kept

08:12.280 --> 08:22.860
issuing new regulations and new rules, and here he was, the most powerful man in
China, and he couldn't affect the bureaucracy. So yeah, that's a very personal

08:22.860 --> 08:30.900
sore point with me. A primitive planet is the setting for the second half of
Bander Snatch. In a climactic struggle, the protagonist, also known as

08:30.900 --> 08:38.940
Bander Snatch, kills a monstrous bear-like alien which has attacked him. Then he
discovers the alien has a young cub, which for some reason befriends him and

08:38.940 --> 08:48.260
becomes his sidekick. O'Donnell told us that the appearance and character of the
cub were unplanned. It just sprang into being. Baby Bear actually came about

08:48.260 --> 08:58.540
almost entirely by accident. I had had, you know, Bander Snatch wandering through
this alien jungle.

09:01.860 --> 09:17.740
And I realized he needed like a, the way the story was going, he had to have
this climactic battle sequence with a natural force, some sort of wild animal.

09:18.280 --> 09:24.260
And I hadn't had any wild animals in there really big enough for him.

09:27.320 --> 09:41.040
All of a sudden, off the page came this monstrous bear-like animal that almost
loomed up before him and started attacking him. And, well, he won. And there I

09:41.040 --> 09:51.760
was with a dead bear on the ground. And just sort of somehow my fingers kept
going. And there was a sound from the distance. And it was the cub. And the next

09:51.760 --> 10:03.320
thing I knew, he had a sidekick, as you put it. That was just accidental,
really. Sidekicks are common in science fiction and fantasy. Here O'Donnell

10:03.320 --> 10:09.860
comments on the role of a sidekick. I think it helps when the protagonist has a
sidekick of some sort.

10:13.040 --> 10:26.640
When you're writing science fiction, well, you know, why not give the hero an
alien sidekick, Sam in the McGill Feighan series? I think it lets you do a little

10:26.640 --> 10:39.660
exploring into alien psychology. And at the same time, it lets you keep making
sort of mirror-like observations of human culture. More with Kevin O'Donnell Jr.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.460
on our next show.

10:47.640 --> 10:55.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:55.460 --> 10:56.220
Odessa, Texas.

11:39.940 --> 11:44.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:59.840 --> 12:05.080
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.480
And here are your hosts.

12:13.740 --> 12:21.740
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s science fiction novel,
War of Omission, was published in 1982. In the book, O'Donnell describes a

12:21.740 --> 12:29.560
violent revolution which takes place in late 20th century America. This
revolution begins in the Northeast. O'Donnell presents the thoughts and actions

12:29.560 --> 12:38.600
of the participants on both sides of the revolution. We asked him what he was
trying to get across in War of Omission. The modern-day recapitulation of the

12:38.600 --> 12:43.260
statement that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

12:47.580 --> 12:59.900
I was trying to say, hey, it's real easy to say that the system stinks and we'll
wipe it out. But what happens when you do wipe it out? You know, I think this is

12:59.900 --> 13:10.040
where every revolutionary since, you know, the French in 1787 has screwed up
thoroughly. They say, well, you know, the present system is corrupt and it's

13:10.040 --> 13:21.180
bloated and it stinks and let's throw it out and we'll have paradise. I think
that's stupid. I'm not a defender of the system. But I think the sort of

13:21.180 --> 13:33.780
sweeping burn it down just doesn't work because, you know, you wind up building
on rubble. You don't move into a structure that you can clean up and straighten

13:33.780 --> 13:44.640
out. I mean, you've got ashes. And I think really those two things were what the
book was all about. The science fictional element in War of Omission is the

13:44.640 --> 13:53.300
tisser, a weapon the revolutionaries perfect which wipes out all objects in the
target area instantaneously. It makes these objects disappear. Right, but it

13:53.300 --> 14:00.680
does something else as well. It wipes out the memory of the target area from
everyone's minds. So if a person's house and family were deleted by a tisser,

14:00.940 --> 14:07.820
neither he nor anyone else would have any memory of them. Most of the action,
especially tisser deletions, takes place in New Haven, the city where O'Donnell

14:07.820 --> 14:19.400
now lives. We asked O'Donnell if he enjoyed writing scenes in which New Haven
gets destroyed. That generated an interesting sidelight. I was sort of offended

14:19.400 --> 14:30.120
by my publisher that they cut some references in there. We have a building here
in town. It's the Knights of Columbus building, and I think it's possibly the

14:30.120 --> 14:43.260
ugliest structure ever erected anywhere in America. It's a huge, towering, ugly
brick building with massive

14:43.260 --> 14:58.180
turrets at each of the four corners of the building. I mean, it looks like it
was designed to hold off an attack by maddened archers. And I took great

14:58.180 --> 15:06.780
pleasure in destroying that in the book, having it totally obliterated from the
face of the earth. And at one point I had a character bring it back and change

15:06.780 --> 15:18.540
his mind. It was so ugly. But the editor took that, cut it right out. Nope,
sorry, can't do that. But it was fun taking out the rest of New Haven. The

15:18.540 --> 15:26.720
concept of the tisser is the heart of War of Omission. O'Donnell told us he put
a lot of effort to make the tisser believable. Well, the hardest part was trying

15:26.720 --> 15:39.900
to make it plausible. And a review or two has appeared that, you know, has
really faulted the book on those grounds. But, you know, for whatever reason

15:39.900 --> 15:52.020
that person just did not believe the tisser. And I put so much effort into
trying to make it believable. I think I put more effort into that than any other

15:52.020 --> 16:03.120
part of the book. Trying to make it seem very natural. And trying to provide
possible explanations for why this happened. Sort of brief meditations on the

16:03.120 --> 16:16.520
nature of reality. For those who accepted the explanation, who believed the
tisser, I think the book worked. And I think if you can't believe it, the book

16:16.520 --> 16:25.220
just falls flat. The tisser is believable, and War of Omission works. We'll look
at Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s Journeys of McGill Feighan series on our next show.

16:32.220 --> 16:40.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show. A production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association. Produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:40.100 --> 17:10.640
Odessa, Texas. 

17:48.220 --> 17:53.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show. A commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.760
And here are your hosts.

18:01.940 --> 18:09.960
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Science fiction author Kevin O'Donnell Jr.
has written many short stories plus six novels to date. Three of his novels form

18:09.960 --> 18:18.660
a series. The series is called The Journeys of McGill Feighan. And the three
installments are subtitled Caverns, Reefs, and Lava. McGill Feighan is a 21st

18:18.660 --> 18:26.740
century earthling who, at age four days, is swallowed by a mysterious, giant,
amoeba-like gastropod, which was sent by the even more mysterious, Far Being

18:27.260 --> 18:36.220
Retzglaran. The infant McGill remains in the gastropod precisely 71 hours and 24
minutes. Then he is discharged, and the gastropod leaves the earth with no

18:36.220 --> 18:45.400
comment. McGill seems to be a normal lad. At age five, however, it is discovered
that he has the flinger talent, the extremely rare ability to transmit people or

18:45.400 --> 18:54.220
objects instantaneously to distant destinations in the galaxy, providing the
total mass of any load doesn't exceed 918 kilograms. Young McGill is enrolled in

18:54.220 --> 19:02.140
the Flinger Academy, where he masters the art under the tutelage of experienced
flingers. Then at age 17, he is certified as a flinger. But since McGill is

19:02.140 --> 19:10.480
puzzled about the motive of the Far Being for having the gastropod swallow him
for three days, he vows to seek out the Far Being and ask him why. Another group

19:10.480 --> 19:17.960
is interested in McGill, too, the organization. They reason that if the Far
Being has something in store for McGill, then they want it, too. The stage is

19:17.960 --> 19:25.920
set. Young McGill is mastering flinging while simultaneously learning about such
things in life as romance, trying to live with the flinger bureaucracy, and

19:25.920 --> 19:34.220
searching for the Far Being. All the while, the sinister organization is after
him. The series is obviously humorous, but it's serious as well. Here O'Donnell

19:34.220 --> 19:50.320
comments on his intention for the series. Well, my primary intent in the McGill
fan series is to do something light, fast-paced, adventuresome, that nonetheless

19:50.320 --> 19:53.400
shows

19:53.400 --> 19:59.140
a person of incredible talent growing up. And the problems he faces.

20:01.940 --> 20:16.080
It's that aspect of it tends to take lower priority. I think the adventures of
McGill Feighan come first. I do want a book that people can sit down and read

20:16.080 --> 20:30.860
quickly and really enjoy. It's not a gloomy book. Bander Snatch and War of
Omission are sort of downbeat books. Mayflies is, in a way, upbeat, but it's

20:30.860 --> 20:45.540
got a lot of depressing stuff in it. Whereas McGill Feighan is, it's not. I do it
partly as a change of pace to write a book that just moves right along the start

20:45.540 --> 20:58.840
to finish. It has a lot of things happening. It's a very clear-cut hero who is
nonetheless human, has his problems. In the first book, Caverns, McGill takes

20:58.840 --> 21:08.740
charge of a Rangan egg which hatches in book two, Reefs. He names the young
reptilian Rangan Sam. And Sam becomes McGill's sidekick. Here O'Donnell comments

21:08.740 --> 21:19.400
on Sam's role. Poor Sam. I mean, he's going to grow up so mixed up. Because he's
being raised entirely on Earth. Well, except for their excursions off world. But

21:19.400 --> 21:31.940
he's being raised by a human being with very human values. But Sam is not human.
And when he gets to maturity, he's going to be, oh, heavens. From the tip of his

21:31.940 --> 21:41.960
nose to the tip of his tail, he's going to be about 15 feet long. And he's going
to stand about, oh, what, four and a half feet high at the shoulder? The back

21:41.960 --> 21:52.380
part of him. And his head will be, you know, pretty much about six feet off the
ground. I mean, he's going to be big. He's going to be very alien-looking. And

21:52.380 --> 22:06.500
he's going to have a lot of trouble because he's neither one nor the other. He's
not a Rangan. He knows nothing of Rangan culture. But he is not and can never be

22:06.500 --> 22:17.180
a human being. I see lots of interesting problems ahead for Sam. More on Kevin
O'Donnell Jr.'s The Journeys of McGill Feighan next time.

22:24.080 --> 22:31.940
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:31.940 --> 22:58.440
Odessa, Texas. 

23:19.960 --> 23:23.880
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:39.680 --> 23:45.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.400
And here are your hosts.

23:53.660 --> 24:00.560
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s science fiction
series, The Journeys of McGill Feighan, is a highly popular adventure yarn

24:00.560 --> 24:07.420
featuring the young flinger, McGill Feighan, who, after having developed his
talent, is searching for the far being. Not only must young Feighan cope with his

24:07.420 --> 24:15.060
talent, and life in general, he must avoid being captured by the organization.
The series is humorous, but interspersed among the action and humor are the

24:15.060 --> 24:22.680
violent deaths of many of McGill's allies and friends, including his parents,
his lovers, and his roommates. We asked O'Donnell why he so freely dispatches

24:22.680 --> 24:35.060
with most of McGill's acquaintances. Part of that is cold calculation on my
part, that when you're writing a series, one of the real difficulties is

24:35.060 --> 24:42.140
convincing the reader that your hero is in danger. When you write one book,
there's no problem, because the reader doesn't know how it's going to come out.

24:42.280 --> 24:49.840
But when you have a series, the reader says, well, hey, look, you know, he's
been through 18 of these adventures now, and he's emerged unscathed from every

24:49.840 --> 25:00.300
one, so why worry? And, you know, the reader's emotional involvement in the
story is lessened. But when there is a real danger, when people near and dear to

25:00.300 --> 25:12.060
him are dying, and in some cases dying horribly, it brings the threat much
closer. It makes it much more plausible. And at this point, McGill has lost a

25:12.060 --> 25:24.280
lot of people who are very close to him. His parents, Nadia and Graystein, he's
going to lose more. You know, as I say, part of it is cold calculation, but part

25:24.280 --> 25:38.940
of it is also realistic appraisal of the situation fans in. He's got this
talent, he's got this mysterious link with this even more mysterious alien

25:38.940 --> 25:41.680
being, and he has people hot on his trail.

25:44.520 --> 25:56.560
And it streams, you know, readers' credibility to have not only Feighan, but all his
friends coming through safe and sound every time. You know, the organization,

25:57.440 --> 26:07.720
they may not be perfect, but they're not total amateurs, and they're going to be
striking real close to home. And they have so far in the first three books, and

26:07.720 --> 26:19.220
they'll continue to. McGill encounters several types of aliens on his journeys.
We ask O'Donnell for what purpose does he use alien characters in the series? In

26:19.220 --> 26:31.300
the fan series, I'm trying to make aliens who are comprehensible, and yet who
are not human. I really think when we run into alien species, and sooner or

26:31.300 --> 26:47.980
later we will, they will have traits which we recognize as traits that we have.
In Lava, I've got these religious fanatics running around. I suspect that any

26:47.980 --> 27:00.240
sentient race we encounter will, at least in one stage of their development,
have gone through an intensely religious period. It might still be religious

27:00.240 --> 27:13.200
today, if you can tell, but I think any sentient being has to wonder on its
origin, how it came to be, why it came to be, who created the universe. So, you

27:13.200 --> 27:18.060
know, I'm trying to, not to mirror humanity,

27:20.500 --> 27:30.840
but to suggest that there are alternates with which we can have traits,
attitudes in common. So far, O'Donnell has written three books in the McGill

27:30.840 --> 27:43.360
-Feighan series. Here's what O'Donnell said when we asked him if there would be
any more in the series. Yes, definitely. At the moment, it's a McGill story, and
