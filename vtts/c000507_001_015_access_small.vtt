Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.660
And here are your hosts.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.740
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.120
Michael Bishop has written a number of stunning science fiction works such as the Novel's

00:49.120 --> 00:55.280
Eyes of Fire, the 1983 Nebula-winning No Enemy but Time, and the Urban Nucleus series A Little

00:55.280 --> 00:56.900
Knowledge and Catacomb Years.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.380
Bishop is also a master at writing short stories.

00:59.820 --> 01:03.520
Some of his outstanding stories are on the Street of Serpents, Death and Designation

01:03.520 --> 01:06.040
among the Asadi, and the White Otters of Childhood.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.660
Fans and fellow writers alike have lauded Bishop.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.120
He has been nominated for some 11 Hugo and Nebula awards.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.220
Bishop's academic training is in English.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.740
We asked him why he writes science fiction rather than mainstream.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.260
Well, the truth is that I have wanted to be a writer since I was in about the eighth grade,

01:23.600 --> 01:27.080
and I did not necessarily want to be a science fiction writer.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.880
I wanted to be just a writer.

01:30.310 --> 01:35.200
The reason that I am doing science fiction now, or have done primarily science fiction,

01:35.480 --> 01:42.600
is that I was first successful in submitting stories that had a fantastic or a science

01:42.600 --> 01:43.500
fictional element.

01:44.180 --> 01:49.500
And in having them sell, the other stories, the mainstream stories that I wrote, received

01:49.500 --> 01:51.840
primarily rejection slips early on.

01:53.880 --> 02:01.900
And as I said before, I am kind of like the rat in the experimental cage who goes to the

02:01.900 --> 02:03.220
lever and presses it.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.800
And when the food comes out of one particular lever, that is the one he goes back to and

02:07.800 --> 02:08.760
continues to press.

02:09.020 --> 02:13.540
And that is the way I have done as far as science fiction goes to some extent.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.340
It is not that I do not care for science fiction, and I am doing it solely because it was profitable,

02:19.340 --> 02:26.620
or more profitable than the other type of writing, but simply that I ended up finding

02:26.620 --> 02:30.680
very receptive editors in this particular field.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.020
And that accounts for it more or less.

02:35.380 --> 02:39.380
Science fiction is attractive to Bishop too, because it allows him the freedom to write

02:39.380 --> 02:41.240
about a number of subjects and situations.

02:41.980 --> 02:46.480
I think that science fiction does permit a writer to deal with just about anything that

02:46.480 --> 02:48.200
he or she wishes to deal with.

02:49.860 --> 02:55.380
You can handle contemporary events by projecting them into the future.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.700
You can speculate about the past.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.400
You can speculate about the distant, distant future.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.320
You can speculate about origins and ultimate ends.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.220
So that I think that really science fiction is a tremendously flexible genre, and that

03:09.220 --> 03:11.060
is one of its main attractions to me.

03:11.240 --> 03:16.040
And one of the reasons why I think I continue to write it even though I have aspirations

03:16.040 --> 03:18.420
to do other things and have done other things.

03:25.540 --> 03:29.880
A funeral for the Eyes of Fire, Bishop's first novel, came out in 1975.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.500
Its revision, entitled Eyes of Fire, came out in 1980.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.440
This novel relates the conflict between two cultures, an advanced spacefaring culture

03:38.440 --> 03:39.300
and a primitive one.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.540
As do many of Bishop's works, this novel carries a heavy, effectively used dose of anthropology.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.800
We ask Bishop about the basis of this book.

03:47.480 --> 03:51.400
It's a parable of some of the things that have happened in our past and that continue

03:51.400 --> 03:55.200
to happen in our relationships to primitive peoples today.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.800
And I probably should put primitive in quotes because that's a term that is frowned upon

04:01.800 --> 04:03.940
in anthropological circles right now.

04:04.740 --> 04:12.000
But at any rate, I do think that it was a kind of dramatic framing of situations that

04:12.000 --> 04:18.180
have taken place in the confrontation between advanced civilizations and supposedly primitive,

04:18.340 --> 04:20.020
in quotes, civilizations.

04:21.160 --> 04:31.360
And it seems to me that in projecting it into a setting on a distant planet, that I was

04:31.360 --> 04:36.620
just kind of presuming that this was the sort of thing that could happen over and over again.

04:36.620 --> 04:44.220
But at the same time, really, it was a comment on the conflict between two different approaches

04:44.220 --> 04:53.520
of viewing the world, one rather the technological approach and one the rather mystical or what

04:53.520 --> 04:55.160
do you call it, the left brain side.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.380
We'll have more with Michael Bishop on our next show.

05:05.420 --> 05:10.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:10.860 --> 05:14.760
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:28.380 --> 05:58.360
Thank you.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.320
And here are your hosts.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.000
This is Daryl Lane.

06:38.360 --> 06:38.920
And Bill Vernon.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.240
Two closely related works by Michael Bishop are A Little Knowledge and Catacombs Years.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.420
A Little Knowledge is a collection of loosely connected short stories and Catacombs Years

06:47.420 --> 06:47.880
is a novel.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.920
Both are about people who inhabit the urban nucleus of Atlanta, a future domed Atlanta

06:52.920 --> 06:54.640
isolated from the rest of the world.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.040
Here Bishop tells us why he used the concept of a domed city.

06:58.600 --> 07:03.620
Each one of the cities was its own universe, its own world, the people were withdrawn and

07:03.620 --> 07:07.800
isolated and they practiced the kind of isolationism.

07:08.200 --> 07:13.720
In fact, in the story of the windows in Dante's Hell, the old woman, Amelia Longhope, who

07:13.720 --> 07:20.420
is bound by two people who were going to her apartment really to discover what's happened

07:20.420 --> 07:20.840
to her.

07:22.180 --> 07:27.740
They find that she has created an entire world in her apartment, which resembles the bridge

07:27.740 --> 07:31.000
of a starship as from an old television program.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.620
And that she has been looking outward while her own society has been looking inward.

07:36.180 --> 07:40.200
So that was one of the things that I was trying to do with the domed city.

07:40.480 --> 07:47.420
I wasn't interested in the domed city as a technological marvel so much as I was in a,

07:48.400 --> 07:54.640
I guess I was looking at each city as a kind of petri dish and I was trying to see what

07:54.640 --> 07:59.400
the human beings, the bacteria, whatever you want to call them inside that petri dish

07:59.400 --> 08:04.600
were going to do, how they were going to behave and why they were behaving in the ways that

08:04.600 --> 08:05.040
they did.

08:05.260 --> 08:14.280
So it was one way of focusing in on the human condition in an unusual way and in a metaphorical

08:14.280 --> 08:14.600
way.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.140
A recurring theme in Bishop's work seems to be an emphasis on eyes.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.660
For instance, there's his first novel, A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.460
The Asadi in Transfigurations have prominent eyes which figure significantly in the plot.

08:44.460 --> 08:49.500
The aliens in his first short story, Pinyonfall, have strange multi-lens eyes.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.480
We ask Bishop about eyes and what they symbolize.

08:53.280 --> 09:00.600
It has always seemed to me that the eyes are what's the old cliche, the windows of the soul.

09:01.920 --> 09:09.880
And for an alien species, I think they would be similarly a means of looking into the heart

09:09.880 --> 09:12.080
of the creature who has those eyes.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.420
I think too, I was looking early on when I wrote the early story, Pinyonfall, which was

09:18.420 --> 09:19.240
my first story.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.400
I was looking for a way of making my aliens seem alien.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.100
And one of the ways was to describe them physically and one of the most outstanding characteristics

09:29.480 --> 09:35.860
of any creature, I think, are the eyes and how they differ from one species to another.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.720
So the aliens in Pinyonfall had eyes like insects.

09:41.420 --> 09:47.720
In A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire, I guess I was again looking for a means, an exotic

09:47.720 --> 09:53.460
means of establishing the fact that my aliens were truly alien.

09:54.200 --> 10:00.000
And by giving them different eyes, eyes like gems, that was one way of doing that.

10:00.520 --> 10:06.760
There may have been some subliminal influence too from one of the novels of Ursula Le Guin

10:07.980 --> 10:10.520
trying to think now, which was A City of Illusions.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.080
I think one of her characters has very, very strange eyes.

10:14.260 --> 10:20.500
But Ursula Le Guin has been an influence on me from way back and maybe that came into it to some extent too.

10:21.880 --> 10:27.120
As far as the eyes of the Asadi go and the fact that they are a means of communication,

10:27.120 --> 10:33.220
as well as a means of seeing, and also a means of feeding when you discover that they enabled

10:33.220 --> 10:39.880
these creatures to photosynthesize part of their food, I think there I was looking at the eyes

10:39.880 --> 10:47.920
in a functional sense as well as in a symbolic sense, as if they really were a physical component

10:47.920 --> 10:50.440
of their makeup that could help them survive.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.780
More with Michael Bishop on our next show.

11:01.080 --> 11:06.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:06.660 --> 11:09.860
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:51.980 --> 11:56.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:12.160 --> 12:17.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.980
And here are your hosts.

12:26.420 --> 12:27.520
This is Bill Vernon.

12:27.740 --> 12:28.280
And Daryl Lane.

12:28.380 --> 12:32.800
One of Science Fiction writer Michael Bishop's most successful short stories is Death of Designation

12:32.800 --> 12:35.220
Among the Asadi, which appeared in 1973.

12:36.040 --> 12:41.420
In 1979, Bishop published the novel Transfigurations, which was a so-called fix-up of this short story.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.300
That is, the story served as the initial third of the novel, then more material was added to continue it.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.100
Here Bishop tells us how this came about.

12:48.100 --> 12:55.760
I think when I wrote that story back in 72 or 73 that I felt that I was pretty much finished with it, that it was complete.

12:57.920 --> 13:06.460
By the time I actually undertook to do Transfigurations, I had thought some more about the characters in that story,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.260
both the humans and the aliens.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.840
And I had also done a great deal of reading on human origins.

13:14.640 --> 13:20.300
A lot of which I worked into the novel that followed that one, No Enemy but Time.

13:20.580 --> 13:28.000
But at the same time, I guess I was really kind of laying the groundwork for No Enemy but Time

13:28.000 --> 13:31.600
with the research that I did that carried me through Transfigurations.

13:32.340 --> 13:39.280
The reason that I probably expanded Transfigurations or Death and Designation Among the Asadi

13:39.280 --> 13:45.340
into a full-length novel that I called Transfigurations is that by that time I was a full-time writer.

13:46.520 --> 13:51.700
I knew that this was one of my most popular stories, that there had been questions about it.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.880
Some of the Luthians had not been tied up.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.720
And I wanted to deal with the material again.

13:59.100 --> 14:08.900
And I wanted to deal with it from the perspective of my new knowledge about human origins and primate anthology, that sort of thing.

14:08.900 --> 14:15.960
So that was one of the reasons that I went ahead, used the original novella as part of the text

14:15.960 --> 14:26.080
and created a good deal of more information about new characters and a sequel to the original novella in the course of the novel.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.320
Transfigurations details an anthropological study of a group of primitive aliens.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.680
Or as Bishop warns us, we must put the primitive in quotation marks.

14:34.680 --> 14:39.540
Anthology forms the basis for Bishop's perhaps most important novel, No Enemy But Time.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.440
This novel won the 1983 Nebula Award.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.500
The protagonist, Joshua Campa, is capable of a sort of time travel through dreams.

14:47.160 --> 14:53.400
In No Enemy But Time, he travels to a similar crumb of Pleistocene East Africa, an Africa inhabited by man's distant ancestors.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.380
Campa lives among these hominids, ostensibly to study them, but he gets involved in their lives.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.800
We commented to Bishop that writing this book must have required a lot of research.

15:02.540 --> 15:08.960
I've told people that I probably did three and a half to four years of research for that book, and I believe that that's true.

15:09.320 --> 15:16.400
And by that I don't mean that I was continuously researching and doing nothing else, not writing anything else, but only researching.

15:17.020 --> 15:27.380
But I nevertheless did spend a great, great deal of time reading material to make my proto-humans, my hominids in that book,

15:27.380 --> 15:32.380
as near to the real thing as I could imagine.

15:33.440 --> 15:41.500
So I read people like Louis B. Leakey and Mary Leakey and Richard Leakey, the entire Leakey clan, Donald Johansson,

15:42.240 --> 15:52.640
everything I could get my hands on in scientific journals and news magazines that related to new discoveries in East Africa, Tanzania, Kenya,

15:52.640 --> 15:56.580
wherever they happened to be, Ethiopia, when Donald Johansson came along.

15:57.260 --> 16:07.500
So yes, I spent an awful lot of time researching the physical nature of the stature, the possible lifestyles of these hominids,

16:07.560 --> 16:19.500
but also the flora and fauna at the same period so that I could make a credible stab at what kinds of other animals they would encounter,

16:20.300 --> 16:27.760
what kind of vegetation they would be living among, how they would have to go about their survival strategies, in other words.

16:28.380 --> 16:37.880
So yes, that took me a lot of time. I found it very, very enjoyable while I was doing, and I really kind of put it out of my mind since then.

16:38.380 --> 16:43.520
I imagine that I may come back to it later on, but I have kind of set it aside since then.

16:50.780 --> 16:56.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:56.380 --> 16:59.600
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:42.260 --> 17:46.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:02.240 --> 18:07.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.140
And here are your hosts.

18:15.980 --> 18:17.460
This is David Carson.

18:17.460 --> 18:18.360
And Daryl Lane.

18:18.620 --> 18:24.340
You might have overheard some junior high or high school students talking about fighting trolls or battling an evil wizard and thought nothing of it.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.860
But you might stop and stare if you heard a lawyer or doctor saying the same thing.

18:28.140 --> 18:32.240
Well, it could happen and does most every weekend all across the U.S. and it's spreading around the world.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.540
Right. What we're talking about is Dungeons & Dragons, a fantasy role-playing game produced by TSR Hobbies.

18:37.820 --> 18:44.720
We talked with Dr. John Eric Holmes, author of fantasy role-playing games, who edited the original basic set of rules for Dungeons & Dragons.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.880
Holmes teaches in the School of Medicine at USC. We asked him to give us a layman's description of the game.

18:51.020 --> 19:06.980
Dungeons & Dragons are the other role-playing games, or a game where a group of people get together and one of them devises the kind of skeleton outline of a story in Dungeons & Dragons.

19:12.940 --> 19:19.440
And the other people, each one of them takes the part of a single adventurer.

19:19.780 --> 19:26.620
And in Dungeons & Dragons you can be an elf or a dwarf or a hobbit or a wizard or a hero.

19:28.520 --> 19:36.020
And then they pretend to go into the story and try and solve the mystery or find the treasure or whatever.

19:36.020 --> 19:50.260
And they all sit around the table and do this and they decide how things come out if they have to decide how an event occurs by just rolling dice and consulting a table in the book to see how the things occur.

19:50.760 --> 19:57.260
So it's a story that's built up by a group of friends working together between them. That's what it is, really.

19:58.540 --> 20:04.840
Dungeons & Dragons, known as D&D, is similar to chess in that there are several different types of pieces or characters on the board.

20:04.840 --> 20:12.040
But the difference is that the players controlling the characters don't know what the whole board looks like. They only know the areas where they have been and where they are at the moment.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.080
Right. Any new area has to be explored, just as if you were really there.

20:16.500 --> 20:21.260
If you want to know what's behind a door, you tell a dungeon master that you want your character to open the door and look inside.

20:21.700 --> 20:29.300
The dungeon master, or DM, is like a referee. He knows the plot of the scenario the players are involved in and tells them of the outcome of their actions.

20:29.300 --> 20:36.060
The game can sound very involved with someone who has never played it, but most of the work is done by the dungeon master who is usually an experienced player.

20:36.700 --> 20:41.220
The game's situation is similar to much of the fantasy literature that is popular today, but with a difference.

20:41.820 --> 20:46.280
Holmes talks about the popularity of Dungeons & Dragons and its relationship to current fantasy literature.

20:46.280 --> 20:57.400
Playing the game is different from reading a story. If you read a story, you can imagine yourself being the hero.

20:57.580 --> 21:07.380
If the story is well written, you can really get into the hero's problems and you can see the wonders that he sees and the excitement that he experiences.

21:09.880 --> 21:18.980
You can really enjoy that, but you have to do what the author says the hero does if you're imagining being that hero.

21:19.900 --> 21:28.940
You can close the book and imagine how you might have handled things or what might happen if you had lived in those times.

21:29.580 --> 21:45.740
There were a lot of people in the country at the time that Dungeons & Dragons were created who had daydreams about what they would do if they were hobbits, or if they were dwarfs, or if they were elves, or heroes.

21:47.480 --> 21:57.000
In the game, you come a lot closer to being a hobbit, or a dwarf, or a hero, or a wizard.

21:57.820 --> 22:03.500
Then you do just reading about it, or that you're imagining it all by yourself.

22:03.880 --> 22:09.560
Because you have several other people playing with you, and let's say you decide that you want to be a wizard.

22:10.180 --> 22:20.600
And all your friends agree that you are a wizard, or that your character in the game, but you start talking about that person as if it were yourself.

22:21.580 --> 22:31.340
Is a wizard, and for four to six hours once a week in the evening, you feel like you really are that person.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.760
And that's a lot more exciting than just reading about such a person.

22:45.800 --> 22:54.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:46.820 --> 23:50.880
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:06.880 --> 24:12.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.740
And here are your hosts.

24:20.780 --> 24:21.980
This is Darrell Lane.

24:22.140 --> 24:22.820
And David Carson.

24:23.180 --> 24:28.940
We're talking with Dr. John Eric Holmes, author of fantasy role-playing games about the leading fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons.

24:29.620 --> 24:34.080
The game was created by Gary Gagax and Dave Arneson in the late 60s and early 70s.

24:34.460 --> 24:39.900
Gagax now runs TSR Hobbies, the company that produces Dungeons & Dragons, as well as other role-playing games.

24:39.900 --> 24:43.480
Several years ago, there was an incident that put Dungeons & Dragons in the public eye.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.680
Supposedly, a student was killed playing a game of live Dungeons & Dragons in the steam tunnels under a university.

24:49.100 --> 24:55.420
That story made national news, but when the entire story was uncovered, it wasn't near as interesting and was buried in the back sections, so to speak.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.740
We asked Holmes to relate the entire incident.

24:57.740 --> 25:12.240
Wasn't there a college student from Michigan who got killed playing live Dungeons & Dragons in the steam tunnels under Michigan State University?

25:12.780 --> 25:14.740
No, there wasn't.

25:16.640 --> 25:32.900
There was a college student at the University of Michigan State, I forgot now, who disappeared and his family couldn't find him.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.800
He was a Dungeons & Dragons player.

25:35.640 --> 25:42.120
And one of the things that the investigators, and they hired a private detective, family hired a private detective to try and locate him.

25:43.160 --> 25:49.020
One of the things that he found was a series of maps, which were probably Dungeons & Dragons maps.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.500
A lot of mysterious maps.

25:51.220 --> 26:00.040
And somebody suggested that they were maps of the steam tunnels underneath the university and that people had been playing Dungeons & Dragons in the steam tunnels.

26:01.660 --> 26:07.940
As far as I know, that's never really been proven to be the case that anybody was actually playing in the steam tunnels.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.280
Anyway, he turned up alive.

26:12.080 --> 26:19.160
He showed up, and I think he had gone to visit some member of his family some distance away.

26:20.960 --> 26:24.480
And when there was enough publicity, there was a lot of publicity about this.

26:25.040 --> 26:30.500
A lot of television and radio news coverage of it when it occurred.

26:32.280 --> 26:44.920
Partly, I think, because the news media people sense that this was a weird cult, like the Jonestown massacre thing, which had occurred a year or so before.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.500
And they thought they were onto something really bizarre.

26:49.580 --> 26:59.360
But he turned up alive and his disappearance had to do with his own personal life and his own personal problems, I guess, and had nothing to do with his playing Dungeons & Dragons.

27:00.780 --> 27:06.460
Another controversy that has brought some criticism of the game is the use of certain mythological creatures in the game.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.500
The game's fantasy element includes demons and devils based either on popular books or classical myths.

27:12.160 --> 27:23.700
The accusation usually is that the game is dangerous because it's actually teaching children.

27:23.700 --> 27:36.420
Of course, the people who are playing the game are frequently adults and not children, but it depends on what age you consider to be a child, and there certainly are plenty of people 12 years old playing the game.

27:38.540 --> 27:45.880
Teaching them evil, a cult, and a demonological ritual.

27:45.880 --> 28:00.040
And the people who make these accusations, as it turns out, are extremely religious people, fundamentalist religious people, who really believe in the existence of the devil and his demons.

28:01.160 --> 28:20.440
The flap over the use of the game, particularly its use as a club in a high school or something like that, usually ends up to be involved with this controversy about how serious do you take demonology?

28:21.480 --> 28:28.420
And if you're serious about it, then you don't want to have it as a game or even as part of a game.

28:29.320 --> 28:36.840
These elements can be left out of the game if the people playing find it offensive. There are hundreds of other mythical creatures to test the metal of any adventurer.

28:37.120 --> 28:46.240
The game's creators never intended Dungeons and Dragons to offend anyone's religious beliefs. They only wanted to bring to life the elements of fantasy that so many people enjoy in books like Lord of the Rings.

28:53.440 --> 29:02.920
