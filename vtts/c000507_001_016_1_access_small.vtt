WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:03.960
Now the tape is on, so everything is on.

00:05.140 --> 00:08.080
I will tell you to be honest from the start

00:08.080 --> 00:11.920
that I don't feel real suited

00:11.920 --> 00:16.100
to do this interview. I really like your work. I've read everything. I've read some of it more than once.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.920
I'm a real left hemisphere person

00:20.960 --> 00:24.240
and so some of the things that you write I feel instead of

00:24.240 --> 00:27.400
I don't see the logic, but I feel it. And so sometimes I'm going to be

00:28.440 --> 00:31.940
grabbing for words because I just don't know how to express myself very well.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.760
I'm better on tapers than a loud.

00:35.080 --> 00:39.500
Well we edit this heavily and try to

00:39.500 --> 00:42.260
make everybody sound as good as possible. It's very informal.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.120
If you want us to repeat a question or you don't like something you said or something we said

00:47.120 --> 00:51.580
we'll just go back and do it over with so there's no problem. And if you got to take a break or you just get tired

00:51.580 --> 00:54.500
or whatever just let me know. So let's start it.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.240
Okay your background is in English

00:58.700 --> 01:02.160
and apparently you went quite far in your education in English and then

01:02.160 --> 01:05.480
teaching and now you're a writer and you write science fiction.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.220
How did you decide or why as a person so interested

01:10.220 --> 01:13.580
in English do you write in the genre of science fiction?

01:15.380 --> 01:18.380
Well the truth is that I have wanted

01:18.380 --> 01:22.420
to be a writer since I was in about the eighth grade and I did not

01:22.420 --> 01:26.480
necessarily want to be a science fiction writer. I wanted to be just a writer.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.500
The reason that I am doing science fiction now

01:30.500 --> 01:33.800
or have done primarily science fiction is that

01:34.420 --> 01:38.460
I was first successful in submitting stories that had

01:38.460 --> 01:42.460
a fantastic or a science fictional element and in having them

01:42.460 --> 01:45.940
sell the other stories, the mainstream stories that I wrote

01:45.940 --> 01:49.300
received primarily rejection slips early on

01:50.400 --> 01:53.300
and as I said before

01:53.300 --> 01:57.120
I'm kind of like the rat in the experimental

01:57.740 --> 02:01.360
cage who goes to the lever and presses it and when the food

02:01.360 --> 02:05.520
comes out of one particular lever that's the one he goes back to and continues

02:05.520 --> 02:09.180
to press and that's the way I have done as far as

02:09.180 --> 02:13.440
science fiction goes to some extent. It's not that I don't care for science fiction

02:13.440 --> 02:16.460
and I'm doing it solely because it was profitable

02:17.260 --> 02:20.240
or more profitable than the other type of writing

02:20.240 --> 02:24.180
but simply that I ended up finding very

02:24.920 --> 02:27.640
receptive editors in this particular field

02:28.420 --> 02:30.900
and that accounts for it more or less.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.960
Does science fiction give you perhaps a range

02:36.580 --> 02:40.460
it's very forgiving as far as the subject matter and the way it's handled a little more

02:40.460 --> 02:44.460
so than other genres. Is that attractive to you? Certainly I think that's

02:44.460 --> 02:48.300
true. I think that science fiction does permit a writer to deal with just about

02:48.300 --> 02:50.620
anything that he or she wishes to deal with.

02:52.020 --> 02:56.280
You can handle contemporary events by

02:56.280 --> 03:00.440
projecting them into the future. You can speculate about

03:00.440 --> 03:04.240
the past. You can speculate about the distant, distant future. You can

03:04.240 --> 03:08.140
speculate about origins and ultimate ends so that I think that really

03:08.140 --> 03:12.160
science fiction is a tremendously flexible genre and that's one of its main

03:12.160 --> 03:16.460
attractions to me and one of the reasons why I think I continue to write it even though

03:16.460 --> 03:20.460
I have aspirations to do other things and have done other things.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.860
Do you write for a particular audience

03:24.860 --> 03:27.220
or do you write what pleases you and it

03:27.220 --> 03:32.120
by happy chance does seem to tickle a lot of people?

03:32.960 --> 03:36.520
I think that for the most part I try to write what interests me and I hope

03:36.520 --> 03:40.980
then that it will interest somebody else. I've read a number of things

03:40.980 --> 03:43.760
fairly recently which suggest that

03:45.220 --> 03:48.440
even though my work is very well crafted

03:48.820 --> 03:51.880
and carefully thought out that I may be

03:53.140 --> 03:56.900
not reaching the audience that some other writers are reaching

03:56.900 --> 04:00.400
because their work seems more readily accessible on a first look

04:00.980 --> 04:05.100
I wish that that were not the case but I don't know how to do things any differently

04:05.100 --> 04:09.060
than I do them. I try not to be inaccessible, that's for certain

04:09.060 --> 04:13.100
and I do feel that some of my more recent work has reached a larger audience

04:13.100 --> 04:17.640
than perhaps the first two or three novels that I wrote.

04:20.740 --> 04:23.360
Okay now we'll start into the line of questions

04:23.360 --> 04:27.180
kind of about specific works and the one I want to start with is

04:27.180 --> 04:31.620
for the Eyes of Fire which was your first novel and that came out in 1975

04:31.620 --> 04:35.700
and that's the first thing I read of yours because I read a very good review

04:35.700 --> 04:36.960
of it right when it came out

04:37.780 --> 04:40.000
and it got award nominations

04:41.000 --> 04:44.500
but then four years later or so you came out with Eyes of Fire

04:44.500 --> 04:48.900
and you said that if you had had your way, the text and the title of the other one would

04:48.900 --> 04:53.220
vanish from the earth, what made you

04:53.220 --> 04:55.200
think that the first one was so bad?

04:56.540 --> 05:00.940
Well it's not that I thought that the first one was so bad and incidentally it's not that

05:00.940 --> 05:05.300
I wanted to get rid of the title, I still like the title of Funeral for the Eyes of Fire

05:05.300 --> 05:07.580
much better than I like, Simply Eyes of Fire

05:09.260 --> 05:13.180
but my editor at Pocket Books when I rewrote the book

05:13.180 --> 05:17.300
felt that we ought to give it a title that was new but that at the same time

05:17.300 --> 05:21.080
reflected the fact that it was not a brand new

05:21.080 --> 05:25.500
work that I was revising in earlier work. As far as

05:25.500 --> 05:29.240
my feelings about a funeral for the Eyes of Fire go

05:29.240 --> 05:33.000
the original novel published by Valentine, I just feel that I was

05:33.000 --> 05:37.020
learning my way then, that was the first time I had ever attempted anything

05:37.020 --> 05:40.880
at novel length, I had done short stories and novelas up to that point

05:40.880 --> 05:44.620
but never anything of the length or the substance of

05:44.620 --> 05:48.960
funeral and to me when I go back

05:48.960 --> 05:52.160
and read the book now I can see all of the places where

05:53.020 --> 05:56.200
I was obviously a beginning writer struggling to

05:56.860 --> 06:00.560
create a narrative and very often lapsing into

06:01.640 --> 06:04.560
many essays of one sort or another rather than

06:04.560 --> 06:08.940
having the action proceed in a logical and really orderly fashion because of

06:08.940 --> 06:12.320
the behavior of the characters. As a consequence

06:12.980 --> 06:16.740
when I go back and look at it I see my characters lecturing each other

06:16.740 --> 06:20.600
I see gaps in the narrative, I see

06:22.200 --> 06:24.920
not inconsistencies necessarily but I just see the

06:24.920 --> 06:28.700
awkwardness of a young writer trying to handle a form with which he's not

06:28.700 --> 06:31.920
yet familiar. I honestly feel that in the revision

06:32.800 --> 06:37.040
which Pocket Books and my editor there and I called Eyes of Fire

06:37.040 --> 06:40.260
I honestly feel that there are those things are

06:40.260 --> 06:44.620
smoothed out. I also feel that some of the thematic

06:44.620 --> 06:48.780
material is more carefully integrated into the narrative than it was

06:48.780 --> 06:51.980
the first time around and that I had thought a little bit more

06:52.700 --> 06:55.020
thoroughly about that thematic material

06:56.060 --> 06:59.100
and that's one of the reasons that I prefer Eyes of Fire

06:59.100 --> 07:02.580
of the revision that it took original

07:02.580 --> 07:05.660
although I wish that I could have kept the original title.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.440
This book has

07:10.920 --> 07:13.940
something in common with some of the other books in that it's

07:13.940 --> 07:17.940
to some extent an anthropological study of these primitive aliens

07:17.940 --> 07:22.840
why it's got encounters between the shaman and technology that sort of thing

07:22.840 --> 07:26.240
the aliens were treating very shabbily. Is this kind of a

07:26.240 --> 07:28.560
parable of some things that have happened in our past?

07:30.280 --> 07:34.660
Well I'm sure that it's a parable of some of the things that have happened in our

07:34.660 --> 07:38.700
past and that continue to happen in our relationships to primitive

07:38.700 --> 07:42.440
people today and I probably should put primitive in quotes

07:42.440 --> 07:46.420
because that's a term that is frowned upon in the

07:46.420 --> 07:50.620
anthropological circles right now but at any rate I do think

07:50.620 --> 07:54.120
that it was a kind of dramatic

07:54.120 --> 07:58.520
framing of situations that have taken place in the confrontation between

07:58.520 --> 08:02.160
advanced civilizations and supposedly primitive

08:02.160 --> 08:05.360
in quotes of civilizations and

08:05.360 --> 08:09.040
it seems to me that projecting it into

08:10.780 --> 08:13.380
what, setting on a distant planet

08:14.120 --> 08:18.560
that I was just kind of presuming that this was the sort of thing that could

08:18.560 --> 08:22.600
happen over and over again but at the same time really it was a comment

08:22.600 --> 08:26.400
on the conflict between

08:26.400 --> 08:30.560
two different approaches of viewing the world one rather

08:30.560 --> 08:34.600
the technological approach and one rather mystical

08:34.600 --> 08:38.340
or what do you call it the left brain side

08:38.340 --> 08:42.640
I guess. Yeah I like that well that's the right

08:42.640 --> 08:46.640
brain but that's I'm unfortunately I'm the

08:46.640 --> 08:50.760
other one so that's the next novel then

08:51.560 --> 08:53.820
chronologically speaking is

08:53.820 --> 08:59.340
I had to wait until a paperback came out

08:59.340 --> 09:02.320
called beneath the shattered moons why

09:02.320 --> 09:06.700
title change I'm sure that may not have been your choice I'll look up the original title

09:07.700 --> 09:10.480
Well the original title of the poem

09:10.480 --> 09:13.440
of Paul McLeese called Andrew Marvel

09:13.440 --> 09:17.200
itself is a kind of answer to

09:17.200 --> 09:20.020
by Andrew Marvel entitled to this poem

09:20.020 --> 09:22.440
of these poems and deals

09:24.440 --> 09:27.720
with what long experiences of time

09:27.720 --> 09:31.260
and mankind's

09:31.260 --> 09:36.200
fragility and smallness in comparison to these long spans of time

09:36.200 --> 09:40.560
at any rate in and strange decadent treat I was drawing

09:40.560 --> 09:43.220
a show that civilizations do rise and fall

09:43.220 --> 09:48.360
and the line from Gleesha's poem seems to be to be

09:48.360 --> 09:51.900
for Paul when the book was

09:51.900 --> 09:56.200
sold to a paperback publisher however Donald Wolheim and Dahl books

09:56.200 --> 10:00.220
he did not feel that that was the sort of title

10:00.220 --> 10:03.560
that was going to be in K-Marts and bus stations

10:03.560 --> 10:08.380
and shoe shine shops to pick up a copy of the paperback

10:08.380 --> 10:11.160
but it needed a little more commercial title

10:11.160 --> 10:15.600
he gave me the chance to choose various titles

10:15.600 --> 10:20.620
and I think I made a list of the four or five shattered moons was one of them

10:20.620 --> 10:23.220
which really kind of echoes early title by

10:23.960 --> 10:27.980
at Christ Burroughs under the moons of Mars so I felt that that was

10:27.980 --> 10:31.280
fairly commercial sounding and it still didn't disturb me too much

10:32.820 --> 10:36.000
replacing it for the other although I do prefer the other title

10:36.000 --> 10:38.560
which many people regard as pretentious

10:41.340 --> 10:43.120
Okay, let's explore

10:43.120 --> 10:47.500
similar to here between in strange decadent treaties and

10:47.500 --> 10:51.160
the short story or the long short story or whatever it is

10:51.160 --> 10:55.000
the white otters of childhood which is by far my favorite story

10:55.000 --> 10:58.340
and to these you have the Parfax

10:58.340 --> 11:02.500
and these people that banish mankind to some kind of island

11:02.500 --> 11:06.280
and there are some similarities but one is in the 52nd century

11:06.280 --> 11:09.560
one is in the 120th century so I was going to ask

11:10.420 --> 11:13.300
stories come from the same kind of known universe

11:14.900 --> 11:18.520
Yes, it's difficult for me to talk about this

11:18.520 --> 11:21.880
with a great deal of authority right now because it's been so long since I

11:23.540 --> 11:25.920
thought about either one of them

11:26.500 --> 11:30.260
at the time though I did intend for and strange

11:30.260 --> 11:33.320
that act pretend the trees pardon me to be a

11:34.000 --> 11:38.360
kind of far future sequel to the white otters of childhood

11:39.040 --> 11:42.340
in other words the situation in

11:42.340 --> 11:44.780
and pretend the tree arises

11:44.780 --> 11:49.420
after the colonizing of a planet in another solar system

11:50.580 --> 11:53.440
out of the situation that prevailed on earth

11:53.960 --> 11:56.880
as it's set forth in the story the white otters of childhood

11:58.400 --> 12:00.880
it's difficult for me at this point really to

12:00.880 --> 12:04.900
explain what I was going to attempt to do with those things I do know that I considered

12:04.900 --> 12:08.680
on the street of the serpents the white otters of

12:08.680 --> 12:12.980
childhood and strange that act pretend the trees

12:12.980 --> 12:16.480
is a kind of trilogy a thematic trilogy if not necessarily

12:16.480 --> 12:20.160
a trilogy in which all of the characters

12:21.700 --> 12:24.480
are related to that sort of thing

12:26.620 --> 12:28.540
Okay, kind of the same question

12:29.400 --> 12:32.380
here the stories blooded on a rank in

12:32.380 --> 12:35.420
the House of Compassionate Shareers seem to share

12:35.420 --> 12:39.280
the same universe with stolen faces and transfigurations

12:39.280 --> 12:44.560
is this another known universe, thread of a known universe that's kind of woven through your work

12:45.460 --> 12:48.200
I think you're probably referring in particular

12:48.200 --> 12:51.520
to the fact that the aliens from one story may crop up

12:51.520 --> 12:55.920
in another the aliens from one novel may crop up

12:55.920 --> 12:58.540
in a short story and I also used the term

12:59.160 --> 13:03.520
galactic com I think to describe the galactic authority

13:03.520 --> 13:08.080
which is colonizing the galaxy for us

13:09.020 --> 13:12.140
yeah this was kind of the shorthand that I used at the time

13:12.140 --> 13:15.180
in order to keep from having to invent a complete

13:16.980 --> 13:19.260
colonizing authority in each story

13:19.260 --> 13:23.280
and also because I liked some of the alien creatures that I had

13:23.280 --> 13:27.220
come up with I didn't feel that I wanted to discard them completely so I would use

13:27.220 --> 13:31.320
them again if possible but it wasn't really a

13:33.400 --> 13:34.840
it wasn't terribly

13:34.840 --> 13:39.140
systematic that's one thing I could say about it I wasn't planning to set

13:39.740 --> 13:42.600
dozens and dozens of novels against this background

13:42.600 --> 13:44.700
and dozens and dozens of stories

13:47.460 --> 13:47.940
okay

13:48.640 --> 13:52.360
the two books, The Little Knowledge and Catacombs

13:52.360 --> 13:55.200
I want to look at them together for just a minute

13:55.860 --> 14:00.700
Catacombs is a fusion or what I call a fusion of six previously written

14:00.700 --> 14:04.460
stories in a new one right yeah six old stories

14:04.460 --> 14:06.980
in a new one and then A Little Knowledge was an original novel

14:07.640 --> 14:12.360
how did those early short stories evolve did they evolve it were you thinking

14:12.360 --> 14:16.280
of a series and then you or did you just say

14:16.280 --> 14:19.680
hey I confused these together and make something kind of nice out of it

14:20.720 --> 14:24.300
well the first story that I ever wrote in that series was

14:24.300 --> 14:28.320
the one called if a flower could eclipse and I wrote that without

14:28.320 --> 14:32.560
thinking that I was ever going to do another story against the same background

14:32.560 --> 14:36.480
and that of course is the urban nucleus of Atlanta the dome city

14:36.480 --> 14:40.020
of Atlanta not a terribly original idea of the dome city but

14:40.600 --> 14:44.040
when I wrote that story it was only the second story that I

14:44.040 --> 14:48.400
had published and I was thinking that a future city should be a

14:48.400 --> 14:51.900
dome city and I was trying to write science fiction of the sword

14:51.900 --> 14:55.380
even though that particular story has a strong fantasy element as well

14:56.480 --> 14:59.680
after I wrote that however I I guess I realized

14:59.680 --> 15:03.800
that there were possibilities for other stories and I wrote

15:03.800 --> 15:08.160
another one and that one was the windows in Dante's

15:08.160 --> 15:12.400
hotel which appeared in orbit 13

15:12.400 --> 15:15.600
I believe orbit I can't remember at this point really

15:16.060 --> 15:19.300
one of the orbit volumes edited by Damon Knight and

15:20.520 --> 15:23.740
at that point I guess having written the second story

15:23.740 --> 15:27.660
I realized that I could go on and write others against the same backdrop

15:27.660 --> 15:31.780
with some of the same characters recurring and

15:31.780 --> 15:35.960
that was what I ended up doing really it wasn't a conscious plan from the beginning

15:35.960 --> 15:40.000
by any means in fact I had to do

15:40.000 --> 15:43.600
a little bit of rewriting when I went back in order to make these stories

15:43.600 --> 15:46.120
connected in a sensible way

15:48.820 --> 15:51.920
you mentioned that this was

15:51.920 --> 15:55.620
the dome city of Atlanta and that dome cities

15:55.620 --> 15:58.900
aren't that original in science fiction but I sense

15:58.900 --> 16:03.520
when I read it that a literal dome city wasn't

16:03.520 --> 16:06.800
your first priority that a dome city gives the writer

16:06.800 --> 16:11.680
a chance to talk about things oh Atlanta

16:11.680 --> 16:15.580
was isolated and it was kind of withdrawn and if I remember right the rest

16:15.580 --> 16:19.100
of the cities and the world weren't domed and they were out among the stars

16:19.100 --> 16:23.480
whereas Atlanta was just kind of all isolated and I wanted to

16:23.480 --> 16:27.020
ask you in that vein why Atlanta what why did you choose Atlanta

16:28.060 --> 16:31.560
well I should mention that I did have it set up so that

16:31.560 --> 16:35.540
there were other cities on the North American continent that were domed in fact this

16:35.540 --> 16:39.300
was called the Federation of Urban Nuclear so I think that there were supposed to be

16:39.300 --> 16:43.440
approximately 20-25 cities and they would have

16:43.440 --> 16:47.560
included New York, Chicago, Los Angeles all of the major cities on the North

16:47.560 --> 16:51.620
American continent all of the major cities of the United States I guess you could say

16:51.620 --> 16:54.560
so that there was a network of dome cities

16:55.140 --> 16:59.300
the idea here however was just as you say kind of metaphorical

16:59.300 --> 17:03.180
each one of the cities was its own universe, its own world that people were

17:03.180 --> 17:07.260
withdrawn and isolated and they practiced the kind of

17:07.260 --> 17:11.160
isolationism in fact in the story the windows in Dante's

17:11.160 --> 17:14.880
Hell the old woman Amelia Longhope who is bound by

17:14.880 --> 17:19.240
two people who were going to her apartment really

17:19.240 --> 17:23.240
to discover what's happened to her they find that

17:23.240 --> 17:27.620
she has created an entire world in her apartment which resembles the bridge

17:27.620 --> 17:30.800
of a starship as from an old television program

17:30.800 --> 17:35.360
and that she has been looking outward while her own society has been looking inward

17:35.360 --> 17:39.840
so that was one of the things that I was trying to do with the dome city

17:39.840 --> 17:43.600
I wasn't interested in the dome city as a technological marvel

17:43.600 --> 17:44.820
so much as I was

17:47.380 --> 17:51.880
I guess I was looking at each city as a kind of petri dish

17:51.880 --> 17:54.720
and I was trying to see what the human beings

17:54.720 --> 17:58.540
the bacteria whatever you want to call it inside that petri dish

17:58.540 --> 18:02.860
were going to do how they were going to behave and why they were behaving

18:02.860 --> 18:05.920
in the ways that they did so it was one way of

18:06.540 --> 18:09.400
focusing in on the human condition in a

18:09.400 --> 18:13.440
in an unusual way and in a metaphorical way

18:15.060 --> 18:18.080
the aliens from 61 Cigny

18:18.760 --> 18:22.740
were as I think aliens would probably be which is inscrutable

18:22.740 --> 18:27.000
but you wrote about them so the question I'm really curious about

18:27.640 --> 18:29.980
they were looking for salvation were they

18:29.980 --> 18:33.280
were they really looking for salvation were they sincere

18:36.000 --> 18:39.220
I pause because I really don't know what to tell you at this point

18:41.640 --> 18:42.840
I would say that

18:42.840 --> 18:46.960
what I wanted to happen in that story was I wanted to

18:46.960 --> 18:51.280
examine and here I'm really going to have to stop and think because it's been a while

18:51.280 --> 18:55.340
I wanted to examine what would be the likely consequences

18:57.620 --> 18:59.100
of the conversion

18:59.100 --> 19:01.660
of an alien species to a human fate

19:02.320 --> 19:07.400
what would be the consequences to the aliens and what would be the consequences in particular to the human

19:07.400 --> 19:11.180
being and I guess my reason for wanting to do that is that

19:11.180 --> 19:14.640
I've always been interested in theological matters in one way or another

19:15.220 --> 19:19.360
and this seemed to me certainly a rather extreme theological speculation

19:19.360 --> 19:23.400
but certainly one that has a degree of validity especially if you

19:23.400 --> 19:27.520
believe as I have a tendency to believe that there is other life in the

19:27.520 --> 19:31.320
universe that we are not the only sentient creatures around

19:31.320 --> 19:35.360
and that we are not the only sentient creatures around who are going to wonder

19:35.360 --> 19:39.380
about their origins their ultimate ends what have you

19:41.740 --> 19:43.320
yeah I would say that the

19:43.320 --> 19:47.260
the aliens were probably really genuinely looking for a variety of

19:47.260 --> 19:51.280
salvation at the same time they may have been trying to show that they were

19:51.280 --> 19:55.000
despite all of their inscrutable behavior

19:56.220 --> 19:59.220
companions to the human beings who had taken them in

20:00.760 --> 20:02.600
that there is a kind of

20:03.140 --> 20:07.040
brotherhood across what the sea is

20:07.040 --> 20:07.320
face

20:10.320 --> 20:14.980
okay the novel Stolen Faces this is one of those that I had trouble kind of

20:14.980 --> 20:17.340
reformulating a question about because it hit me

20:18.620 --> 20:21.940
more emotionally than it did logically but it's

20:22.500 --> 20:26.600
more or less a leper colony and again it's got this theme

20:26.600 --> 20:30.880
of an exiled group that's exiled because they have

20:30.880 --> 20:34.940
this disease and it's got some characters that are really hurting

20:34.940 --> 20:38.380
that sort of thing one of the questions I wanted to ask you about that was

20:38.880 --> 20:43.120
which I want to talk about some other things later is the Spanish influence

20:43.120 --> 20:47.320
did your experiences in Spain have anything to do

20:47.320 --> 20:49.420
with this story or did it come from something else

20:51.100 --> 20:55.740
there were several influences on that particular story and I would say that the Spanish influence

20:55.740 --> 20:59.320
the fact that I attended my last year of high school

20:59.320 --> 21:03.260
in Spain and an American dependent school outside of Seville

21:03.260 --> 21:06.100
did have an influence partly because

21:07.080 --> 21:11.260
the one foreign language that I have is Spanish that's the one foreign language

21:11.260 --> 21:14.940
that I can deal with with any degree of authority and also that helped

21:15.580 --> 21:18.760
the other two influences on that particular book however

21:18.760 --> 21:21.620
were a book

21:22.620 --> 21:27.120
I can't remember the author's name at this point but it was a study of the

21:27.120 --> 21:31.020
Aztec civilization and Aztec culture and at the same time

21:31.020 --> 21:35.160
another book about Father Damien who was

21:35.160 --> 21:38.600
the leper priest on Malachi

21:38.600 --> 21:40.960
an island in the Hawaiian group

21:42.380 --> 21:46.620
and so my disease muformacy as I call it in that particular

21:46.620 --> 21:50.480
novel stolen faces is a variety of leprosy I say as

21:50.480 --> 21:54.100
much in the course of the novel itself except that it can

21:56.740 --> 21:58.080
affect somebody

21:58.080 --> 22:02.500
even in a temperate climate or a cold climate as well as a tropical

22:02.500 --> 22:06.760
climate which is where Hanson's disease or leprosy usually strikes

22:06.760 --> 22:09.860
the whole point of the book really though was to

22:10.650 --> 22:14.580
examine the nature of prejudice and also what prejudice itself does

22:14.580 --> 22:18.140
to those who are discriminated against

22:19.680 --> 22:22.880
and really that's the point

22:22.880 --> 22:24.960
of inspiration for stolen faces

22:29.680 --> 22:30.380
Transfigurations

22:30.380 --> 22:34.260
was the next novel and it was a continuation of

22:34.260 --> 22:36.280
death and designation among the Asahdi

22:38.980 --> 22:42.160
I figured it was in the same universe as

22:42.160 --> 22:46.120
stolen faces and to me the Asahdi were

22:46.120 --> 22:50.320
really alien which again I think real aliens would be and this was

22:50.320 --> 22:53.880
an anthropology study and it was also as I said a continuation

22:53.880 --> 22:57.700
of the death and designation did you just

22:58.180 --> 23:02.100
that story you liked the background that's worth thinking

23:02.100 --> 23:05.560
did you always have the idea of completing it and making a novel out of it

23:07.720 --> 23:10.020
No, I never always had the

23:10.020 --> 23:13.800
idea I think when I wrote that story back in 72 or 73

23:13.800 --> 23:17.280
that I felt that I was pretty much finished with it that it was complete

23:19.320 --> 23:21.800
by the time I actually undertook

23:22.360 --> 23:25.480
to do transfigurations I had thought some more about

23:26.100 --> 23:29.400
the characters in that story both the humans and the aliens

23:29.400 --> 23:33.280
and I had also done a great deal of reading on human

23:33.280 --> 23:36.880
origins a lot of which

23:37.360 --> 23:41.260
I worked into the novel that followed that one No Enemy But Time but

23:41.260 --> 23:45.380
at the same time I guess I was

23:45.380 --> 23:49.160
really kind of laying the groundwork for No Enemy But Time with the research

23:49.160 --> 23:53.460
that I did that carried me through transfigurations the reason

23:53.460 --> 23:56.840
that I probably expanded transfigurations or

23:56.840 --> 24:00.940
death and designation among the Asadi into a full length novel that

24:00.940 --> 24:05.120
I called transfigurations is that by that time I was a full time writer

24:06.280 --> 24:09.160
I knew that this was one of my most popular stories

24:09.160 --> 24:11.960
that there had been questions about it some of the

24:12.620 --> 24:16.880
Luthians had not been tied up and I wanted to deal with

24:16.880 --> 24:20.340
the material again and I wanted to deal with it from

24:20.340 --> 24:24.460
from the perspective of my new knowledge about human origins

24:24.460 --> 24:27.860
and primate ethology that sort of thing

24:27.860 --> 24:31.140
so that was one of the reasons that I went ahead

24:31.920 --> 24:35.320
used the original novella as part of the text and created

24:35.320 --> 24:40.100
a good deal of more information about new characters

24:40.740 --> 24:44.480
and a sequel to the original novella in the course of the novel

24:47.020 --> 24:47.900
This is

24:48.320 --> 24:52.440
one of those real obvious questions but I have to ask it because I do want to know the answer too

24:52.440 --> 24:54.800
In transfigurations

24:54.800 --> 24:59.540
the aliens eyes are very important

24:59.540 --> 25:02.520
of course a funeral for the eyes of fire or eyes of fire

25:03.280 --> 25:08.060
just the title that goes without saying that they are and also the house of compassionate shares

25:08.060 --> 25:12.040
and pinion fall the eyes are really important

25:12.040 --> 25:16.240
so it seems to me that you have kind of not a fixation

25:16.240 --> 25:18.860
but they obviously symbolize something

25:18.860 --> 25:20.240
is that true?

25:21.900 --> 25:25.760
Well I would say that the eyes certainly do symbolize something

25:25.760 --> 25:29.980
I don't know whether I want to go a whole lot further than that

25:29.980 --> 25:33.840
I guess that it has always seemed to me that the eyes

25:35.600 --> 25:39.040
are what's the old cliche the windows of the soul

25:40.060 --> 25:42.720
and for an alien species I think they would be

25:43.640 --> 25:46.520
similarly a means of looking into

25:47.340 --> 25:50.320
the heart of the creature who has those eyes

25:52.140 --> 25:54.460
I think too I was looking early on

25:54.460 --> 25:58.340
when I wrote the early story pinion fall which was my first story I was looking for

25:58.340 --> 26:02.460
a way of making my aliens seem alien and one of the ways

26:02.460 --> 26:06.000
was to describe them physically and one of the most outstanding characteristics

26:06.520 --> 26:10.740
of any creature I think are the eyes

26:10.740 --> 26:13.980
and how they differ from one species to another so

26:13.980 --> 26:17.420
the aliens in pinion fall had eyes like insects

26:19.040 --> 26:22.000
in a funeral for the eyes of fire

26:22.000 --> 26:25.780
I guess I was again looking for a means, an exotic means

26:25.780 --> 26:30.120
of establishing the fact that my aliens were

26:30.120 --> 26:33.700
truly alien and by giving them different

26:33.700 --> 26:37.220
eyes, eyes like gems that was one way of doing that

26:37.860 --> 26:40.880
there may have been some subliminal influence too from

26:40.880 --> 26:43.780
one of the novels of Ursula Le Guin

26:44.800 --> 26:47.440
I'm trying to think now which was a city of illusions

26:47.440 --> 26:52.740
I think one of her characters has very very strange eyes but Ursula Le Guin has been an influence

26:52.740 --> 26:57.260
on me from way back and maybe that came into it to some extent too

26:58.600 --> 27:00.940
as far as the eyes of the Asadi go

27:00.940 --> 27:04.900
and the fact that they are a means of communication as well as

27:04.900 --> 27:08.820
a means of seeing and also a means of feeding when you discover that

27:08.820 --> 27:12.800
they enabled these creatures to photosynthesize part of their food

27:14.000 --> 27:16.960
I think there I was looking at the eyes in a functional

27:16.960 --> 27:20.960
sense as well as in a symbolic sense as if they really

27:20.960 --> 27:24.480
were a physical component of their

27:24.480 --> 27:26.640
make up that could help them survive

27:29.820 --> 27:32.920
Knowing them in but time is also

27:32.920 --> 27:34.520
an anthropology book as you said

27:36.260 --> 27:38.820
you probably on this one had to do a lot of

27:38.820 --> 27:41.200
homework I would think for the prehumans

27:43.940 --> 27:46.580
Yes I've told people that I probably did

27:46.580 --> 27:50.780
three and a half to four years of research for that book and I believe that that's true

27:50.780 --> 27:54.560
and by that I don't mean that I was continuously researching and doing nothing

27:54.560 --> 27:57.200
else not writing anything else but only researching

27:58.340 --> 28:01.880
but I nevertheless did spend a great great deal of time

28:01.880 --> 28:05.600
reading material to make

28:05.600 --> 28:08.700
my proto humans my hominids in that book

28:08.700 --> 28:13.560
as near to the real thing as I could imagine

28:14.480 --> 28:18.220
so I read people like Lewis B Leakey

28:18.220 --> 28:22.000
and Mary Leakey and Richard Leakey the entire Leakey clan, Donald Johansson

28:23.100 --> 28:25.160
everything I could get my hands on

28:25.160 --> 28:29.720
and scientific journals and news magazines that related to

28:29.720 --> 28:33.280
new discoveries in East Africa, Tanzania, Kenya

28:33.280 --> 28:37.080
wherever they happened to be Ethiopia when Donald Johansson came along

28:37.570 --> 28:40.400
so yes I spent an awful lot of time researching

28:41.470 --> 28:44.660
the physical nature, the stature

28:44.660 --> 28:49.400
the possible lifestyles of these hominids but also the flora

28:49.400 --> 28:53.940
and fauna at the same period so that I could make a credible stab

28:53.940 --> 28:57.120
at what kinds of

28:57.120 --> 28:59.380
other animals they would encounter

29:00.080 --> 29:04.980
what kind of vegetation they would be living among, how they would have to go about their

29:04.980 --> 29:09.160
survival strategies in other words so yes that took me

29:09.160 --> 29:13.100
a lot of time. I found it very very enjoyable while I was

29:13.100 --> 29:17.260
doing and I really kind of put it out of my mind since then

29:17.260 --> 29:21.400
I imagine that I may come back to it later on but I have kind of

29:21.400 --> 29:22.780
set it aside since then.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.280
That book I personally viewed

29:26.280 --> 29:28.620
is kind of a two-ponged

29:31.820 --> 29:32.420
oh

29:33.940 --> 29:38.260
it had two facets okay that engage me. One was the anthropology

29:38.260 --> 29:42.540
the lore and that sort of thing, that was fascinating but I also really liked the

29:42.540 --> 29:46.100
protagonist. He was really engaging, likeable

29:46.600 --> 29:50.360
and in science fiction you, especially modern science

29:50.360 --> 29:53.060
fiction, you don't often find that but I really like the guy.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.500
So I would assume that

29:57.300 --> 30:01.520
he just popped in your mind or does the character just form

30:02.400 --> 30:05.260
gradually and that's just how he turned out eventually.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.760
I will have to say that really he formed gradually over the

30:09.760 --> 30:13.200
composition of the book. There were a number of things that

30:15.040 --> 30:18.120
my plot dictated. I had to have a

30:18.120 --> 30:21.440
character who was somehow attuned to the distant past

30:22.120 --> 30:26.260
and particularly the distant past of Pleistocene East Africa and as a

30:26.260 --> 30:30.100
consequence I came up with a character who had vivid dreams even

30:30.100 --> 30:33.900
from his infancy on about this particular period

30:33.900 --> 30:38.420
so that his attunement to the Pleistocene in East Africa would make it possible

30:38.420 --> 30:40.820
later on for an Air Force

30:41.840 --> 30:45.840
time program to actually send him back bodily to that period

30:46.580 --> 30:50.000
or a simulacrum of that period as I explained it in the book

30:50.000 --> 30:53.660
so that much I knew I was going to have to give him.

30:54.140 --> 30:57.960
After that however I was really kind of on my own to come up

30:57.960 --> 31:01.780
with the sort of person that he happened to be and that unfolded

31:01.780 --> 31:06.140
for me gradually in the composition of the book and I was kind of surprised to discover

31:06.140 --> 31:09.820
who Joshua Campa really was or the kind of character

31:09.820 --> 31:13.920
that he really was and that was one of the nice things about writing the book too.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.760
Did you write the book in the order that

31:17.760 --> 31:21.720
we read it? In other words there are some alternating

31:21.720 --> 31:25.980
chapters past to present to past to present. Did you write it that way or did you

31:25.980 --> 31:28.360
write all the past and all the present and then cut them up?

31:30.640 --> 31:33.340
To tell you the truth I think I wrote

31:34.620 --> 31:37.820
alternating chapters. There were

31:37.820 --> 31:40.640
a couple of occasions when perhaps

31:41.660 --> 31:43.360
the episodes in the past

31:44.640 --> 31:48.560
I may have split them up and inserted a chapter from the present or from

31:48.560 --> 31:51.520
the near future but for the most part I actually did

31:52.320 --> 31:56.640
go back and forth. I did not write them in the order that they actually occur in the

31:56.640 --> 32:00.540
book however as a matter of fact the first thing in the book, the prologue, I wrote

32:00.540 --> 32:04.320
at the very end after I had completed the composition of the entire novel.

32:05.060 --> 32:08.660
I might also add here that David Hartwell, my editor

32:08.660 --> 32:12.380
at Timescape, was instrumental in helping me

32:12.380 --> 32:16.680
to cut down the book. It was considerably longer than it is

32:16.680 --> 32:18.560
now and it's quite a long novel anyway.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.820
He suggested the elimination of some chapters

32:24.820 --> 32:28.540
that were really kind of peripheral to the development of Joshua Kampa

32:28.540 --> 32:32.260
and also peripheral to the story of

32:33.160 --> 32:36.380
his return to and his life among

32:36.380 --> 32:40.700
the early hominids. So it would be

32:40.700 --> 32:44.460
difficult for me right now to reconstruct the exact order in which

32:44.460 --> 32:47.580
I wrote the individual chapters of that book but I did

32:48.620 --> 32:52.360
write some segments in the past, come and write some in the present

32:52.360 --> 32:54.980
and then eventually go back and

32:56.000 --> 33:00.020
kind of shuffle them together as if I were shuffling a deck of cards

33:00.020 --> 33:03.040
but perhaps and at least I hope so with a degree more

33:03.780 --> 33:06.260
not the same degree of randomness.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.000
I

33:11.000 --> 33:15.360
read, unfortunately I wasn't there but I read that in your nebula

33:15.360 --> 33:18.820
acceptance speech that you mentioned David Hartwell

33:18.820 --> 33:23.020
a couple of times and mentioned that he had been helpful so I take it that

33:23.020 --> 33:26.660
writers do appreciate it when good editors can come along

33:26.660 --> 33:31.040
and help them see the forest

33:31.040 --> 33:34.740
instead of the trees or the trees instead of the forest

33:34.740 --> 33:38.840
whatever you're supposed to say. Well I owe a special debt of gratitude

33:38.840 --> 33:42.760
to Hartwell. I would have to go back as far as a little

33:42.760 --> 33:47.040
knowledge for instance because he helped me with that book, he helped me with catacomb years

33:47.040 --> 33:50.580
and although he had moved over to Timescape

33:50.580 --> 33:54.540
which then was simply a pocketbook Simon and Schuster

33:54.540 --> 33:57.040
before he came up with the Timescape logo there

33:58.860 --> 34:01.400
but he helped me also with transfigurations

34:01.400 --> 34:04.840
in other words he was at Berkeley Putnam when that book was

34:04.840 --> 34:10.740
contracted for but he moved to pocketbooks before he had a chance to work on it.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.780
Nevertheless he did give me some help on it

34:13.780 --> 34:17.620
and he gave me a lot of help as I've indicated

34:17.620 --> 34:20.900
on no enemy but time. I don't know whether all writers

34:20.900 --> 34:24.120
appreciate that sort of editorial help and direction

34:24.120 --> 34:28.200
but I know that I can use it upon occasion and I think that

34:28.200 --> 34:31.340
Hartwell happens to be one of the people in the field who can give

34:33.500 --> 34:34.620
intelligent help.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.680
Under Heaven's Bridge was a collaboration with Ian Watson

34:40.680 --> 34:43.740
with whom you've collaborated on editing

34:43.740 --> 34:46.920
some short stories if I remember right since then.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.520
How did the mechanics of collaborating take place

34:51.520 --> 34:55.080
and I also wanted to venture a guess that the aliens were mostly you

34:55.080 --> 34:57.640
mostly your aliens. I just wanted to throw that in.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.840
Yeah the aliens really are my aliens because

35:03.220 --> 35:07.340
what he even wanted to do in fact what he suggested is that I write

35:07.340 --> 35:10.740
a story about the aliens the signosticoid from

35:10.740 --> 35:15.100
a little knowledge and catacomb years but rather than showing them

35:15.100 --> 35:19.380
in a human environment the urban nuclei that I take them and show them

35:19.380 --> 35:22.320
against their background of their home planet.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.100
So I told him I think I wrote him a letter

35:27.100 --> 35:30.600
we've been corresponding since about 1976 I believe

35:30.600 --> 35:35.480
and I wrote him a letter and said I'm really tired of those aliens

35:35.480 --> 35:39.240
I don't think I want to do anything else with them at all. I'm finished

35:39.240 --> 35:43.240
with them and he wrote back at that juncture and gave me

35:43.240 --> 35:45.960
a number of interesting ideas about them and said

35:47.820 --> 35:50.040
it's really too bad because there are lots

35:50.040 --> 35:53.980
of good things that we could still do with them and at that

35:53.980 --> 35:57.520
point we decided that maybe we could go ahead and collaborate on it.

35:58.100 --> 36:02.060
So the aliens were mine and he even wanted to see

36:02.060 --> 36:05.580
what they would be like on their own home world

36:05.580 --> 36:08.920
so we sent an expedition

36:09.460 --> 36:13.760
an earth expedition to their home planet and had them encounter

36:13.760 --> 36:17.760
those aliens there. We gave them a different name because we discovered a number of

36:17.760 --> 36:18.420
things about

36:21.180 --> 36:25.680
the star system 61's sickness is not really the kind of

36:25.680 --> 36:29.200
double binary that would support the kind of life that I had

36:29.760 --> 36:33.940
come up with in a little knowledge and catacomb years

36:33.940 --> 36:37.600
so we had to change a few things and so I think we called them kybers

36:37.600 --> 36:42.260
in Under Heaven's

36:42.260 --> 36:45.300
bridge which indicates that they are a kind of

36:45.300 --> 36:50.180
cyborg organism but naturally so

36:50.180 --> 36:54.600
that they evolved in that fashion and as far as the

36:54.600 --> 36:59.040
mechanics of the collaboration, Ian sent me about 30 pages of material

36:59.040 --> 37:02.380
which included a beginning, a middle and an end and suggested

37:02.380 --> 37:06.560
that we work from that as kind of an outline. I took those 30 pages

37:06.560 --> 37:10.280
and expanded them to about 100 and then we simply worked on

37:11.800 --> 37:13.760
in perpillating new chapters

37:14.280 --> 37:18.020
in that material. I believe Ian wrote the prologue to the

37:18.020 --> 37:22.040
book as well and I had final control over

37:22.040 --> 37:26.080
the entire manuscript just to make sure that the style

37:26.080 --> 37:27.680
was fairly consistent throughout.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.120
Kay, I want to

37:33.120 --> 37:37.120
get off now and ask a couple of questions about

37:38.020 --> 37:40.180
poetry and how it relates to your work.

37:41.060 --> 37:44.860
White Otters of Childhood which I said a while ago was my favorite

37:44.860 --> 37:48.420
story. The hero was Mark Cryer-Raines and he's a poet

37:50.400 --> 37:53.040
and he talks a lot about

37:53.040 --> 37:56.180
poetry in the story and he quotes poetry and he said

37:56.780 --> 38:01.080
there's a quote I remember one time where he said, you can't write poetry when your spirit

38:01.080 --> 38:05.060
is submerged. So I wanted

38:05.060 --> 38:08.940
to kind of delve into that. Is that you talking? Because you do

38:08.940 --> 38:12.900
write poetry and there must be some of you and him and is that true? Is that the way

38:12.900 --> 38:16.760
a poet works? Oh, golly. I think

38:16.760 --> 38:19.180
I probably ought to acknowledge

38:20.660 --> 38:24.720
a debt here to Roger Zalazny in particular. I don't know whether you know

38:24.720 --> 38:28.800
you must know. His early story arose from Ecclesiastes which has

38:28.800 --> 38:32.860
as its protagonist a poet and that story

38:32.860 --> 38:36.440
of his I believe, well it is, it's my favorite story of his

38:37.420 --> 38:40.460
and I think I was probably working with that

38:40.460 --> 38:44.920
story in mind when I wrote The White Otters of Childhood.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.620
I'll also have to say that I had read

38:48.620 --> 38:52.820
recently, by that I mean before I began writing

38:52.820 --> 38:57.080
The White Otters, I had read the poetry

38:57.080 --> 39:00.860
of St. John Perce who was a French poet,

39:00.860 --> 39:04.900
was a diplomat who also wrote poetry and he has a

39:04.900 --> 39:08.720
long poem called C-Marks and

39:08.720 --> 39:12.960
some of the lines in that particular poem suggested the title

39:12.960 --> 39:16.960
of The White Otters of Childhood to me and also the nature of the

39:16.960 --> 39:20.880
protagonist, also the nature of the mood that

39:20.880 --> 39:24.860
I tried to evoke in the story. I don't think anybody has

39:24.860 --> 39:28.800
really paid much attention to that or even noticed it even though I think I quote

39:28.800 --> 39:32.460
from him at the head of one of the sections of the story

39:32.460 --> 39:35.360
I use an epigraph of his at the head of one of the sections.

39:36.980 --> 39:40.620
As far as it being impossible to write

39:41.360 --> 39:45.160
poetry when the spirit is submerged, is that what I said?

39:45.460 --> 39:48.840
That's what you said. Okay, I would say that that's

39:48.840 --> 39:53.220
probably true. That disturbs me a little bit

39:53.220 --> 39:56.680
because I find that lately I've written less and less poetry.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.800
I'm not sure that my spirit is submerged so much as I am

40:00.800 --> 40:04.920
that poetry does not

40:06.380 --> 40:08.400
put food on the table whereas

40:09.960 --> 40:12.760
prose can sometimes do that. So I have written

40:12.760 --> 40:16.960
a lot more prose lately than I have poetry although I still like poetry

40:16.960 --> 40:18.720
and would like to be able to write more.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.900
What I need to do is ask you a short answer question and then flip

40:24.900 --> 40:26.940
my tape and I have two more after that.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.180
So I'll reverse the order because I wanted to ask the other one first.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.780
Is science fiction poetry viable because you have written some

40:36.780 --> 40:41.120
science fictional poetry as well. I have down here

40:41.120 --> 40:44.620
the rhyme between Betelgeuse and

40:44.620 --> 40:48.540
Proust and for the lady of a physicist I was kind of tickled by that rhyme.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.800
But science fiction poetry is just a gimmick that people can use

40:52.800 --> 40:56.400
and get into magazines. Do you think that's something that's real

40:56.400 --> 40:58.100
and maybe will become more important?

40:59.940 --> 41:04.200
Well I've always felt that it was possible to write poetry about anything

41:04.200 --> 41:07.380
so that it seems to me entirely possible and viable

41:07.380 --> 41:11.180
and legitimate to write poetry about

41:13.740 --> 41:15.020
speculative subjects

41:15.020 --> 41:19.240
or subjects that use science in one way or another.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.920
Whether it's a gimmick on the part of the people who are writing it

41:22.920 --> 41:27.040
to get into the magazines I have no idea. I'm sure that the science fiction magazines

41:27.040 --> 41:30.740
could not publish any other type of poetry however

41:31.420 --> 41:34.940
but poetry that deals with the speculative subject

41:34.940 --> 41:38.680
or with science in some way or another.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.340
Okay we need to flip our tape

41:43.340 --> 41:46.720
if you want to take a quick break

41:46.720 --> 41:48.580
and then we'll take a break.
