Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.120
And here are your hosts.

00:42.540 --> 00:50.880
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Of all the themes handled by science fiction
authors, that of alien contact has been one of the most consistently popular and

00:50.880 --> 00:58.420
fascinating. For a good reason, too. Aliens, whether they be the hostile bug
-eyed monsters of the old pulp magazines or the friendly creatures of close

00:58.420 --> 01:06.080
encounters of the third kind, have always been one of the biggest attractions of
science fiction. In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as

01:06.080 --> 01:15.380
thrillers, with the sole and simple intention of scaring readers. H.G. Wells'
The War of the Worlds is probably the best example of that type of story. But

01:15.380 --> 01:22.960
that's changed. Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful
treatments of aliens, deepening the realism and the significance of narratives

01:22.960 --> 01:23.920
of alien contact.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.380
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you have to have some
aliens. One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science

01:40.380 --> 01:49.160
fiction is found in Larry Niven's and Jerry Pornell's The Moat in God's Eye. The
success of that book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens, the

01:49.160 --> 01:57.220
Moaties, that Niven created for the story. It's interesting, though, that Niven
says he doesn't really create aliens for a story, but suggests that it's the

01:57.220 --> 02:12.060
other way around. I always design aliens for themselves. I almost never design
an alien to match a story. The story, some story will eventually include the

02:12.060 --> 02:20.820
alien. The alien stands for himself. There are two particularly fascinating
things that Niven incorporated into these Moaties. One is the fact that they are

02:20.820 --> 02:29.240
not symmetrical. They have a head, torso, legs, and arms, as humans do. But the
arms are disproportionate. One is small and thin, the other is large and

02:29.240 --> 02:40.220
powerful. Right. Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of
living creatures on Earth. In that case, I had the idea that I was following a

02:40.220 --> 02:54.300
progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba. You get radial symmetry inside and
out. Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on

02:54.300 --> 03:06.280
the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside. Move up a little further, you
find flatworms and worms of all stance. At the level of bilateral symmetry

03:06.280 --> 03:19.420
inside and out. Go as far as a human, you find bilateral symmetry on the outside
and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside. The lungs look

03:19.420 --> 03:31.560
symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody
dropped a plate of spaghetti. I tried to move on to the next step, bilaterally

03:31.560 --> 03:38.780
unsymmetrical on the outside. And I got the original Modi, which was the
engineer for them.

03:50.080 --> 03:58.220
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Modis is the way they construct
and use machines. They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard

03:58.220 --> 04:06.500
pre-manufactured machines, parts, or tools. They simply alter or reshape
whatever they find around them at the time to suit their needs. Niven says that

04:06.500 --> 04:17.360
particular idea just came to him. It seemed interesting and even logical. I was
just playing with ideas at that point, and that one seemed like a fun one. It

04:17.360 --> 04:31.660
also seemed likely enough, if you've got a critter with not much intelligence
except in the direction of tool making and tool altering, then why not? But the

04:31.660 --> 04:43.200
thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it. It might as well be
designing something every time it needs a specific machine. Besides the

04:43.200 --> 04:51.560
ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Modis, he and Pornel also weaved
some unexpected twists into the first contact theme. A reader interested in

04:51.560 --> 04:56.140
aliens, or more specifically in first contact, can't afford to overlook the Moat
in God's eye.

Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

06:22.620 --> 06:24.240
And here are your hosts.

06:29.040 --> 06:36.820
This is Daryl Lane. And to Bill Vernon. The so-called new wave in science
fiction, which began in the mid-60s, was simply a new way of writing traditional

06:36.820 --> 06:46.900
science fiction. There were changes, for instance, in... ...the modernization
was given more emphasis. ...sex and religion, that science fiction hadn't

06:46.900 --> 06:56.940
really... ...the new wave changed the stereotyped science fiction formulas
that... ...since the pulp days of the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Frederick Pohl, who's

06:56.940 --> 07:06.620
been an author, an editor, and an agent in the field of science fiction, has
something to say about that change. The new wave was an attempt, I guess, 15

07:06.620 --> 07:14.600
years ago or more, of a number of writers to break away from the traditional
kinds of fiction. In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction

07:14.600 --> 07:26.180
anymore. They wanted to call it speculative fiction, or... And they were
interested, merrily, in writing about the inner space, rather than... ...the

07:26.180 --> 07:38.240
second, really, a lot of them... ...in things like... ...and rock music and so
on. But... ...in the... ...rather bitter internal... ...stool that went on in

07:38.240 --> 07:45.420
science fiction, a lot of people take the science one way or the other. I
think... ...people... ... ...
