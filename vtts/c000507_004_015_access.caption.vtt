Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.120
And here are your hosts.

00:42.540 --> 00:50.880
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Of all the themes handled by science fiction
authors, that of alien contact has been one of the most consistently popular and

00:50.880 --> 00:58.420
fascinating. For a good reason, too. Aliens, whether they be the hostile bug
-eyed monsters of the old pulp magazines or the friendly creatures of close

00:58.420 --> 01:06.080
encounters of the third kind, have always been one of the biggest attractions of
science fiction. In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as

01:06.080 --> 01:15.380
thrillers, with the sole and simple intention of scaring readers. H.G. Wells'
The War of the Worlds is probably the best example of that type of story. But

01:15.380 --> 01:22.960
that's changed. Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful
treatments of aliens, deepening the realism and the significance of narratives

01:22.960 --> 01:23.920
of alien contact.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.380
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you have to have some
aliens. One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science

01:40.380 --> 01:49.160
fiction is found in Larry Niven's and Jerry Pournelle's The Mote in God's Eye. The
success of that book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens, the

01:49.160 --> 01:57.220
Moties, that Niven created for the story. It's interesting, though, that Niven
says he doesn't really create aliens for a story, but suggests that it's the

01:57.220 --> 02:12.060
other way around. I always design aliens for themselves. I almost never design
an alien to match a story. The story, some story will eventually include the

02:12.060 --> 02:20.820
alien. The alien stands for himself. There are two particularly fascinating
things that Niven incorporated into these Moties. One is the fact that they are

02:20.820 --> 02:29.240
not symmetrical. They have a head, torso, legs, and arms, as humans do. But the
arms are disproportionate. One is small and thin, the other is large and

02:29.240 --> 02:40.220
powerful. Right. Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of
living creatures on Earth. In that case, I had the idea that I was following a

02:40.220 --> 02:54.300
progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba. You get radial symmetry inside and
out. Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on

02:54.300 --> 03:06.280
the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside. Move up a little further, you
find flatworms and worms of all stance. At the level of bilateral symmetry

03:06.280 --> 03:19.420
inside and out. Go as far as a human, you find bilateral symmetry on the outside
and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside. The lungs look

03:19.420 --> 03:31.560
symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody
dropped a plate of spaghetti. I tried to move on to the next step, bilaterally

03:31.560 --> 03:38.780
unsymmetrical on the outside. And I got the original Motie, which was the
engineer for them.

03:50.080 --> 03:58.220
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Moties is the way they construct
and use machines. They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard

03:58.220 --> 04:06.500
pre-manufactured machines, parts, or tools. They simply alter or reshape
whatever they find around them at the time to suit their needs. Niven says that

04:06.500 --> 04:17.360
particular idea just came to him. It seemed interesting and even logical. I was
just playing with ideas at that point, and that one seemed like a fun one. It

04:17.360 --> 04:31.660
also seemed likely enough, if you've got a critter with not much intelligence
except in the direction of tool making and tool altering, then why not? But the

04:31.660 --> 04:43.200
thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it. It might as well be
designing something every time it needs a specific machine. Besides the

04:43.200 --> 04:51.560
ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Moties, he and Pournelle also weaved
some unexpected twists into the first contact theme. A reader interested in

04:51.560 --> 04:56.140
aliens, or more specifically in first contact, can't afford to overlook the Mote
in God's eye.

05:03.240 --> 05:11.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:11.200 --> 05:11.960
Odessa, Texas.

05:54.820 --> 05:58.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.240
And here are your hosts.

06:29.040 --> 06:36.820
This is Daryl Lane. And to Bill Vernon. The so-called new wave in science
fiction, which began in the mid-60s, was simply a new way of writing traditional

06:36.820 --> 06:46.900
science fiction. There were changes, for instance, in... ...the modernization
was given more emphasis. ...sex and religion, that science fiction hadn't

06:46.900 --> 06:56.940
really... ...the new wave changed the stereotyped science fiction formulas
that... ...since the pulp days of the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Frederik Pohl, who's

06:56.940 --> 07:06.620
been an author, an editor, and an agent in the field of science fiction, has
something to say about that change. The new wave was an attempt, I guess, 15

07:06.620 --> 07:14.600
years ago or more, of a number of writers to break away from the traditional
kinds of fiction. In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction

07:14.600 --> 07:26.180
anymore. They wanted to call it speculative fiction, or... And they were
interested, merely, in writing about the inner space, rather than... ...the

07:26.180 --> 07:38.240
second, really, a lot of them... ...in things like... ...and rock music and so
on. But... ...in the... ...rather bitter internal... ...stool that went on in

07:38.240 --> 07:45.420
science fiction, a lot of people take the science one way or the other. I
think... ...people... ... ...

07:52.660 --> 07:57.160
But we need to remember here that the New Wave wasn't really a planned and deliberate movement

07:57.160 --> 08:01.380
by a unified group of writers. One of the principal proponents of the New Wave,

08:01.800 --> 08:06.300
author Norman Spinrad, believes it was just a bunch of diverse writers doing their own thing.

08:07.220 --> 08:11.960
It was an old way, but there was never as a coherent philosophy in school of science fiction,

08:11.960 --> 08:16.460
but there was never a New Wave in the same sense. There were a lot of ways. There are a lot of

08:16.460 --> 08:20.840
different people doing a lot of different things. The people that were identified as the New Wave

08:20.840 --> 08:27.020
were very diverse. What I was actually writing is very different to what Tom Dish was writing,

08:27.260 --> 08:33.260
or Ballard, or Zelazny, or Delaney were also identified as New Wave writers. This stuff is

08:33.920 --> 08:39.060
much more than, you know, Zelazny and Delaney and myself and Ballard and Aldiss and Mike,

08:39.060 --> 08:50.040
but there were more differences between our work and the old stuff. There was more difference

08:50.040 --> 08:53.380
within the so-called New Wave than there was within the so-called old Wave.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.420
But Spinrad also thinks the New Wave was tightly connected to what was happening in society.

08:59.680 --> 09:04.180
Of course, this mirrored the cultural climate at the time. It mirrored what was happening politically,

09:04.180 --> 09:07.940
it mirrored what was happening in music, it mirrored what was happening in movies,

09:08.200 --> 09:12.440
it was a phenomenon that went through the western civilizations at home.

09:19.020 --> 09:24.080
There are those who say the New Wave is dead. Five-time Hugo winner Larry Niven says so,

09:24.160 --> 09:30.140
for instance, and offers a reason for his passing. The New Wave is a very persuasive thing,

09:30.730 --> 09:39.800
and very easy to use to justify bad stories. I think that's what killed it. Not the

09:40.700 --> 09:49.740
increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format are a bad thing

09:49.740 --> 09:56.600
in themselves, but it's so easy to use New Wave to justify a bad story. It was bound to go out.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.040
The influence of the New Wave is still around, though. It's left its mark on the field.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.860
Science fiction has been broadened, maybe enhanced somehow because of it.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.580
Frederik Pohl states it well.

10:13.640 --> 10:18.540
And the New Wave, if nothing else, taught a bunch of old dinosaurs like Asimov and

10:19.940 --> 10:25.180
Heinlein and me, that there were non-traditional ways of constructing a novel.

10:25.180 --> 10:29.460
See, most of us had grown up when science fiction was in the pulp magazine,

10:29.660 --> 10:33.340
and most of it was written according to some variant of a pulp formula.

10:34.460 --> 10:39.780
Well, it's necessary. I think the New Wave is responsible for teaching us that.

10:47.320 --> 10:52.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:52.040 --> 10:55.840
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.280
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.600
And here are your hosts.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.500
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. The award-winning novel Ringworld is probably

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
Larry Niven's finest work. The Ringworld is an immense ring, large enough to hold 3 million

12:23.500 --> 12:28.780
Earths, and with a thousand-mile high wall to hold in its atmosphere. It also has continents and oceans.

12:29.460 --> 12:32.080
The Ringworld contains trillions of inhabitants of different species,

12:32.560 --> 12:37.180
and derives energy from the sun at its center. Niven recalls where he obtained the idea for such

12:37.180 --> 12:45.800
a fantastic structure. I ran across the concept Dyson's sphere. Dyson, the mathematician, came up

12:45.800 --> 12:50.880
with the concept Dyson's shell, and he was misunderstood to some extent. So,

12:51.680 --> 12:58.800
presently, I ran across an article about Dyson's sphere. A picture that is a golf ball, 93 million

12:58.800 --> 13:05.840
miles in radius, with a sun at the center, and gravity generators all around the outside, so

13:05.840 --> 13:12.860
he would live on the inside, terraform it with oceans and soil and air.

13:13.420 --> 13:20.760
I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be improved, and I wound up with the Ringworld.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.280
Reader studied the science behind the Ringworld and wrote Niven about seeming inconsistencies in

13:32.280 --> 13:39.100
the design of the immense artifact. Column errors and elaborations because some of them don't really

13:39.100 --> 13:43.360
fit the errors. It's just something that hadn't gotten into the original book.

13:44.140 --> 13:48.940
One of the errors was spotted by some MIT students. It had to do with the instability of the Ringworld.

13:49.740 --> 13:56.440
I suspected the Ringworld was unstable, and I suspected you'd eat attitude jets. I was sure that

13:56.440 --> 14:01.960
the Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit Bussard ramjets to be used as attitude jets,

14:02.060 --> 14:05.520
which means you don't have a fuel problem at all. You're burning the solar wind.

14:07.620 --> 14:13.320
But rapidly, some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable, and they were canning it

14:13.320 --> 14:19.260
in the halls at the next World Cup. The Ringworld is unstable. The Ringworld is unstable.

14:21.900 --> 14:27.980
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability,

14:28.280 --> 14:34.560
and they are horrifying. The Ringworld, a major solar flare, would have the Ringworld

14:34.560 --> 14:41.480
grinding against its sun in five years. Well, I worked it in the plot. That was one

14:41.480 --> 14:48.160
elaboration or error. Even teenage readers analyzed his Ringworld with a critical scientific eye.

14:49.120 --> 14:55.200
A high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld, and their conclusion was that the

14:55.200 --> 15:00.860
Ringworld's worst problem is that all the top soil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

15:01.500 --> 15:06.060
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld. No mountain building forces.

15:13.060 --> 15:18.280
But in a sequel, Ringworld Engineers, Niven attempted to correct such deficiencies.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.840
He devised a way to answer the criticism of the Florida high schoolers.

15:23.900 --> 15:32.220
Okay, that's a tough one. I set up a spill pipe system that runs the bottom from the

15:32.220 --> 15:40.300
sea bottoms under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the Ringwall. That even allows you some

15:40.300 --> 15:47.640
some mind accumulation of useful metals.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.920
Fan response of that sort caused Ringworld engineers to be written,

16:01.360 --> 16:04.320
and although Niven once said he wouldn't write anymore in the Known Space series,

16:04.800 --> 16:08.020
the body of stories to which Ringworld belongs, he's not so sure anymore.

16:09.460 --> 16:17.060
I've given up saying that the Known Space series is dead. There's just no point in it.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.600
I've written five books worth of Known Space stories since I said that.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.460
More on Larry Niven tomorrow.

16:30.480 --> 16:35.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:35.240 --> 16:39.080
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:22.100 --> 17:26.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:42.020 --> 17:47.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.600
And here are your hosts.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.380
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.660
He's one of the best-selling authors in the field of science fiction.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.960
A fairly large portion of his work falls into the Known Space series,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.000
a group of stories and novels with a consistent chronology.

18:08.540 --> 18:12.600
Such a series is called a Future History. Niven believes there are some peculiar

18:12.600 --> 18:15.300
attractions a Future History has for a science fiction author.

18:16.040 --> 18:22.600
There had been Future Histories around, Poul Anderson and Robert Heinlein.

18:24.540 --> 18:30.760
And I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

18:31.200 --> 18:36.420
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent workable future,

18:37.060 --> 18:39.800
it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

18:41.120 --> 18:47.920
You put it in the background because you want the background of a story to seem

18:48.480 --> 18:51.900
bigger than it is. So there are things that are simply unexplained.

18:53.320 --> 18:58.260
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it?

18:58.440 --> 19:02.660
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story,

19:02.700 --> 19:04.860
it allows you to elaborate on that background.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.500
You sometimes you fall in love with the background.

19:08.060 --> 19:10.600
And presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

19:22.240 --> 19:26.160
Niven has also written some bestselling books that fall outside his known space series.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.740
Three of these, The Mote in God's Eye, Lucifer's Hammer,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.140
and Oath of Fielty were written in collaboration with Jerry Pournelle.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.620
We asked Niven how he and Pournelle collaborate.

19:36.740 --> 19:45.000
Hard sometimes, but it always resolves. The question is who is most qualified to write a

19:45.520 --> 19:51.440
that we have both decided needs writing. Before we start, we have the novel all laid out.

19:52.400 --> 19:57.640
We know what's going in virtually everywhere. And if we don't, it feels like we do.

19:58.620 --> 20:02.100
And if we find out we don't, we elaborate as we get to that section.

20:03.500 --> 20:08.160
Okay, the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene? Sometimes it's obvious.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.400
If we're dealing with a mad man, he's mine.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.780
If we're dealing with military operations, it's Jerry's.

20:15.860 --> 20:24.920
Aliens are generally mine. Politics is generally Jerry's. Knowledge of history, generally Jerry's.

20:25.300 --> 20:32.520
And a real evil son of a bitch, Jerry usually creates him. And I usually run with him afterwards.

20:41.660 --> 20:46.460
Niven occasionally writes science fiction humor, or rarity. He talks about his most successful

20:46.460 --> 20:55.840
piece of humor. I suppose I could name old man of steel woman of queen eggs, which has gotten me

20:55.840 --> 21:01.900
the most laughs. I suppose everybody seems to have read it. Those who haven't have heard about it

21:01.900 --> 21:07.900
in a cocktail party. Niven's ready eye for humor can also be appreciated as he reveals that he's

21:07.900 --> 21:13.040
detected one of his own alien creations from Ringworld, a Pearson's Puppeteer here on Earth.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.180
I have reason to suspect a pair of puppeteers on Earth.

21:18.400 --> 21:24.240
Look at the characteristics. Forget the shape. They must be masters of biology that hide that

21:24.240 --> 21:29.900
peculiar three-legged two-headed shape. But consider their characteristics. They are cowards.

21:31.480 --> 21:37.440
That is, they want everything utterly safe. No corners on anything. Everything is soft,

21:37.440 --> 21:42.920
surfaces around the Puppeteer world. They don't even keep their world near a sun,

21:43.380 --> 21:52.100
regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is. So, desperate regard for safety,

21:52.280 --> 22:02.100
they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species. Driving urge to meddle with

22:03.260 --> 22:08.180
practically no restraints attached. What does that remind you of? It seems nearly

22:08.180 --> 22:11.000
certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson's puppeteer.

22:18.240 --> 22:23.140
