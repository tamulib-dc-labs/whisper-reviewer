WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:06.080
Well, yeah, one other thing I better say, I will ask you questions that are very obvious

00:06.080 --> 00:10.860
and that I know the answers to, you know, but the listeners may not, so some of them

00:10.860 --> 00:12.100
will just be simple background.

00:12.640 --> 00:12.920
Right.

00:13.180 --> 00:13.340
Okay.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.220
Whatever you wish.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.480
First of all, could you say just a few brief words about the when the Tolkien Society was

00:22.480 --> 00:27.080
formed and, you know, basics like its membership and the number of countries that belong to

00:27.080 --> 00:28.020
it, things of that sort?

00:28.460 --> 00:35.740
The Society was founded in England in 1969 with a very small group of members.

00:37.220 --> 00:45.920
The Society has grown gradually over the years, various notices in various books, directory

00:45.920 --> 00:47.040
listings and so on.

00:47.760 --> 00:55.660
We now have 1,200 members, approximately, in 26 countries throughout the world.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.020
So, although we're based in England, I think we have the largest worldwide spread.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.360
And the Society, I believe, has two publications.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.000
What are those?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.760
We have two regular publications.

01:10.600 --> 01:17.840
Amonhen is approximately bimonthly, is a bulletin and a newsletter, letters of comment

01:17.840 --> 01:23.960
from members, short articles, short poems, small artwork.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.980
It's really for immediate consumption, the ephemeral material.

01:32.240 --> 01:37.420
And the other publication is Malon, the journal, very much more academic.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.220
It comes out, we hope, twice a year.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.380
So, sometimes we get the Malon and Amonhen together.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.360
Malon is a larger format.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.960
It has longer poems.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.200
Sometimes they run to three pages, members' own poems, in the Tolkien manner.

01:57.220 --> 02:01.240
Some of them are imitations of Tolkien's style.

02:01.540 --> 02:05.180
Others are members' own work in their own styles.

02:05.940 --> 02:14.060
Essays, longer book reviews, articles of rather more specific interest.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.560
And it is very much less time dependent.

02:19.960 --> 02:25.700
What about any kinds of gatherings or meetings or fellowship among the members?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.200
Is there any kind of activity of that sort?

02:27.400 --> 02:28.200
Oh, yes, considerable.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.100
Our local groups are called Smiles.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.220
From the Hobbit Smile is a comfortable Hobbit whole.

02:35.940 --> 02:41.320
And we hope that our members feel as comfortable in our smiles as they would in a Hobbit home.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.940
We have Smiles in many countries.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.820
In some countries, there just aren't enough members to get together because they're too widely separated.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.900
But in England, there are Smiles all over the country.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.340
They run themselves as they wish.

03:02.860 --> 03:06.280
Some of them are very formal, some have costume, others don't.

03:06.600 --> 03:15.520
Some publish their own little newsletters with subsequent meeting venues, short reviews of artwork.

03:16.280 --> 03:21.320
It just depends on what the members in any particular area wish to do.

03:22.960 --> 03:27.140
Are there other types of functions, like for instance the kind we have in America here,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.480
with costuming and feasting and things of that nature?

03:30.020 --> 03:36.560
We have two national meetings a year of organised formality.

03:36.860 --> 03:42.980
There's the annual general meeting, which is a business meeting, which is our formal event.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.100
We have a formal dinner with speakers and guests.

03:47.100 --> 03:47.880
It is not a convention.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.880
The other meeting, which is in fact the largest of the National Gatherings,

03:54.140 --> 04:02.820
larger, with two of them I should say, is Oxenmoot, held in Oxford over a weekend in late September.

04:04.220 --> 04:10.300
And it is a weekend where members who otherwise don't normally see other people come together.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.320
The Smiles send representative groups.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.140
Other societies send representative groups.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.540
This year we should have groups from Stockholm.

04:19.780 --> 04:21.900
There will be a representative from America.

04:22.820 --> 04:26.100
There will be groups from all over the United Kingdom.

04:27.680 --> 04:32.240
And it is just a weekend of being in company of Tolkien people.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.720
We have had an impromptu linguistic discussion with an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Swede,

04:43.100 --> 04:45.380
a Dutchman and an Norwegian.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.000
And we were all speaking English of one sort or another.

04:48.760 --> 04:55.420
It was quite interesting seeing the comparative linguistic analyses compared with their own translations.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.960
This question I think may be a little difficult to answer.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.520
Do you have any impressions of the...

05:06.520 --> 05:07.280
Let's put it this way.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.380
Are there differences between American Tolkien fans and British?

05:12.080 --> 05:14.660
I would imagine the American fans may be a bit more...

05:16.760 --> 05:18.620
Oh, what? Less serious perhaps.

05:19.080 --> 05:19.100
Excellent.

05:19.960 --> 05:20.400
Yes.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.260
Yeah, most definitely.

05:22.920 --> 05:29.700
American fans are very much more exuberant in the way they go about things.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.300
We are...

05:31.300 --> 05:34.460
Well, some people think we may be a little bit too state and too formal.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.120
But it suits...

05:38.280 --> 05:40.940
Well, it sounds a little bit high-handed to say so,

05:40.940 --> 05:47.560
but it suits our purpose to be more literary and to keep our costume event down to one a year.

05:48.240 --> 05:53.680
If we did everything in costume, then it might lose some of its interest,

05:53.680 --> 05:55.500
because that is not how we were set up.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.680
The Swedish societies, of which there are three major ones,

06:00.700 --> 06:01.960
do things in costume.

06:02.120 --> 06:07.940
They are specifically organized in a manner very similar, in fact, to the American SCA.

06:08.780 --> 06:11.380
They do society for creative anachronism.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.720
They do things in costume with weapons and they have guilds.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.540
But they don't publish quite so much as we do.

06:22.660 --> 06:25.280
But there is room in Tolkien fandom for all sorts.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.100
And it will be a poorer place without either of us.

06:31.240 --> 06:36.440
Is the Tolkien society in contact with members of the Tolkien family?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.270
And do they ever...?

06:38.260 --> 06:42.820
Yes, in quite considerable contact, I'm pleased to say.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.580
Oxenmoot is usually...

06:46.580 --> 06:47.620
Well, for the past...

06:50.400 --> 06:54.460
Since we started holding Oxenmoots, we have been honored by Priscilla Tolkien

06:54.460 --> 06:56.340
coming along to our party on Saturday.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.820
She usually manages to bring some other family members with her.

07:01.260 --> 07:09.180
And on the Sunday, we are all invited up to her house for a drink and much more talk.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.580
And she's got a small house.

07:11.580 --> 07:15.700
And when you get nearly a hundred fans or crammed into one small house in the garden,

07:15.920 --> 07:18.480
it can sometimes be a little difficult to move around.

07:20.840 --> 07:28.020
Oxenmoot this year, which has now happened, was under canvas this year

07:29.140 --> 07:33.560
on the farm of Joan Baker, Michael Tolkien's daughter.

07:34.020 --> 07:40.000
So the professor's granddaughter had the society pitch camp, as it were,

07:40.000 --> 07:41.420
after the harvest.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.100
And I couldn't get to that, unfortunately.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.360
No, I'm telling you lies.

07:47.860 --> 07:48.860
It hasn't happened yet.

07:49.240 --> 07:49.900
I don't think it's all wrong.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.920
It happens just before I get back from America, so I couldn't get to it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.620
By the time this is broadcast, it may very well have been over.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.080
Probably will be.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.660
We'll take care of that.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.960
What about Christopher Tolkien?

08:04.460 --> 08:05.300
Do you have any correspondence?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.480
Or does he contribute anything?

08:07.480 --> 08:11.280
Or does he make you aware of papers that he still has, perhaps?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.540
We only wish he did.

08:15.060 --> 08:19.040
Christopher is extremely busy with the papers.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.660
He is the literary executor.

08:21.800 --> 08:27.340
And much as we would like to be in close contact with him to answer all our questions,

08:27.880 --> 08:31.360
we would also like him to stay where he is somewhere in France,

08:31.600 --> 08:33.720
busy editing to publish more material.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.100
So we don't, in fact, have any contact with him.

08:38.620 --> 08:44.300
That isn't by choice, rather than by imposition.

08:44.980 --> 08:51.540
Anything that we do find, we find out through various other sources.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.440
But we do not have any correspondence directly with Christopher.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.480
It would be unfair to bombard him with questions

08:59.060 --> 09:03.580
when the publication of the next book quite easily answer all those questions for us.

09:04.940 --> 09:10.320
Do you have any idea of any significant material that may be unpublished that's left

09:10.320 --> 09:11.640
that he might be working on?

09:12.060 --> 09:15.540
Well, there is a great deal of linguistic material still to be published.

09:16.420 --> 09:20.080
Whether it will be published as a book of linguistic matters,

09:20.580 --> 09:24.300
or whether they will end up as footnotes in other books, I don't know.

09:25.180 --> 09:26.960
There is a great deal of poetry.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.540
The Silmarillion had a remarkable lack of verse,

09:32.400 --> 09:34.040
which we are waiting to see.

09:35.420 --> 09:40.580
There may be other tales filling in some gaps in Middle Earth.

09:42.480 --> 09:51.400
But all we know is that there were the papers sat in box files on a table eight feet long.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.300
There is a considerable amount of material.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.780
How much of it is publishable is not known.

09:59.780 --> 10:04.940
How much of it is readable is, again, a matter for debate,

10:05.020 --> 10:07.280
because towards the end of his life the professor's handwriting

10:08.260 --> 10:12.420
became not so much untidy as illegible, and even Christopher can't read it.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.440
I've heard that some of his material may even perhaps maybe personal journals

10:17.440 --> 10:19.320
have been written in Elvish, is that correct?

10:19.680 --> 10:21.680
They were written in Tangua, yes, certainly.

10:21.860 --> 10:26.700
Whether they were written in the Elvish language, either of them, I don't know.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.680
I somehow doubt it.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.940
It would be nice if they were, because then we'd have a much larger vocabulary to work with.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.640
Humphrey around across his travel when he was writing the biography,

10:38.260 --> 10:41.400
some of the diaries were written in Tangua, and Humphrey had to learn the Tangua,

10:42.580 --> 10:45.860
so that he could read the diaries and find out what he was trying to write about.

10:47.700 --> 10:52.420
I heard you answer this over in the Tolkien a little while ago,

10:52.460 --> 10:54.080
but I'd like you to make a restatement of this.

10:56.020 --> 11:01.240
Is this the Tolkien society, the one in England or the ones in America,

11:01.740 --> 11:04.080
are they going to run out of material ever?

11:04.300 --> 11:08.060
Is this something that can be ongoing, or is it after you do a certain amount of work

11:08.060 --> 11:10.560
and get a certain amount of books out and so forth, is it over with?

11:12.540 --> 11:16.360
Well, there are always new people coming in to the society,

11:16.500 --> 11:18.380
as people discover Middle Earth at all ages.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.200
And people will be asking the same sort of questions,

11:23.340 --> 11:24.940
but they'll be asking them in different ways,

11:25.300 --> 11:29.320
and as more and more material gets published, interpretations will vary.

11:30.540 --> 11:35.640
I think there will be sufficient interest, after all, Sherlock Holmes society has been

11:35.640 --> 11:41.400
going for some time, and there's now no longer any possibility of more Sherlock Holmes stories.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.820
That doesn't seem to worry them at all.

11:45.260 --> 11:48.340
And with what we already have of Middle Earth,

11:49.260 --> 11:53.160
we can keep going for a considerable number of years.

11:53.720 --> 11:59.400
And of course, we mustn't forget that the professor did a lot of pure academic linguistic

11:59.400 --> 12:04.580
material, which is very difficult to find, but extremely worthwhile when you can find it.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.080
And that will keep us going for a very, very long time.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.520
Good. Okay. Just a couple more questions, maybe of a personal nature.

12:16.220 --> 12:20.780
Why do you think people from so many different countries, so many different backgrounds,

12:21.020 --> 12:25.220
languages and so forth, what is it about Tolkien that can draw them together,

12:25.860 --> 12:27.060
that fascinates them?

12:30.240 --> 12:37.160
Well, I can only say what the way I look at it, there are as many different answers to that

12:37.160 --> 12:40.780
question as there are members, and maybe even more answers than members.

12:41.500 --> 12:48.600
For my part, I think it fulfills a need that modern society has somehow missed out.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.920
Fellowship is a very strong feeling throughout the books.

12:54.340 --> 13:02.120
That seems to have disappeared from modern society. The idea of the high and the ancient

13:02.860 --> 13:09.740
retaining some of its old power. Tolkien has been accused of stealing his ideas from other

13:09.740 --> 13:15.800
mythological sources, which is irrelevant because those sources themselves borrowed

13:15.800 --> 13:21.480
material from even earlier works. So that argument can be discounted. But it is,

13:25.760 --> 13:32.660
there is a need for some sort of, well, it's not a religious belief.

13:32.660 --> 13:39.020
The Tolkien would not have been happy with that suggestion. But it's a social aspect.

13:40.280 --> 13:45.780
Modern society is becoming very isolated. Everyone's staying in their own little city and,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.300
well, people move around by plane. But you don't get to meet people with the same

13:53.060 --> 14:01.080
likes, the same dislikes, or even the same taste in literature. And societies like ours

14:01.080 --> 14:08.240
are helping to put people in contact with each other. And so interchange ideas and opinions

14:08.240 --> 14:13.480
and ways of looking at life. That's one of the best answers I've heard for that. And that's

14:13.480 --> 14:19.860
very good. Thank you. Actually, that would be all I can think of that we would,

14:21.900 --> 14:24.720
can you think of anything else that I might be missing or that you would

14:26.600 --> 14:33.140
normally be asking this sort of interview that you could add? There are so much more,

14:33.220 --> 14:37.260
I mean, in terms of the books themselves. I don't have good fast statistics at you.

14:37.660 --> 14:45.020
In terms of society itself, maybe, or I can't think of anything else that,

14:48.480 --> 14:51.300
I mean, that's why I have enough material. It's fine. I'm just wondering if,

14:51.300 --> 14:55.540
you know, since this was done without plan on my part, I may have been missing some

14:55.540 --> 15:00.900
ideas or things that I would have thought of had I had some more time to work it out.

15:04.720 --> 15:12.440
Well, I'm satisfied. Well, I can't think of anything that screams for immediate publication.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.720
I think that would work fine. I appreciate that. Thank you.

15:15.720 --> 15:22.080
Let's just exactly what I wanted. Okay, one year. Okay, let's check.

15:25.940 --> 15:31.320
I'm just an English teacher. Audio visual, man, might walk in halfway through the interview.

15:32.900 --> 15:38.760
Okay, first of all, okay, now, obviously, I'll get some information from you before you go about,

15:39.200 --> 15:43.980
you know, your name, your title, I mean, just any particulars about the show. So there'll be an

15:43.980 --> 15:49.720
introduction to that. Right. Okay. First of all, can you just say a few words about the

15:49.720 --> 15:57.260
the Science Fiction Poetry Association when it started? It was founded in January 1978 by Suzette

15:57.260 --> 16:05.840
Hayden Elgin, who is a novelist that lives or writes mostly Ozark tales. And she was interested

16:05.840 --> 16:12.100
in poetry and saw no basic form format or forum for poets within the science fiction or fantasy

16:12.100 --> 16:26.520
genre, genres to get to know each other, to work together and act together and organize some sort

16:26.520 --> 16:37.340
of a network for people to make science fiction poetry more available to readers, basically.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.520
It's a national group, then you have members all over the country?

16:40.520 --> 16:45.560
National group and our membership is up to 140. It doesn't sound like a whole lot, but we're kind

16:45.560 --> 16:49.660
of on fire. Poets, you know, there are fewer numbers, but we're on fire.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.760
Can you say anything? I mean, do you have a structure? Say a president? Things of that sort?

16:56.200 --> 17:02.780
Yeah, our president is Jean Wolf. He's a well-known science fiction writer. And as the secretary,

17:03.980 --> 17:08.920
Maureen Kaplan, she takes care of all the business. And I edit the newsletter, which is why you have

17:08.920 --> 17:22.500
me sitting here. Okay, you edited the newsletter then, okay. At the moment, the newsletter seems to

17:22.500 --> 17:29.560
be the focus of the organization because we don't have any great amount of business that is important

17:29.560 --> 17:34.760
to us. We're sort of like a very small, non-profit organization, and just basically people getting

17:34.760 --> 17:41.580
to know each other and setting up workshops at conventions, doing readings, teaching each other

17:41.580 --> 17:48.660
a little bit about poetry, helping each other find good markets. Some of us are editors of poetry

17:49.500 --> 17:56.920
magazines. Some of us are editor of literary magazines. Some of us are just dabblers in poetry. Some of

17:56.920 --> 18:03.820
us take marketing poetry seriously. Some of us write poetry to great lengths. Some people just

18:03.820 --> 18:09.400
like to read poetry. Everybody is welcome to the organization. Are most of your members those

18:09.400 --> 18:14.980
science fiction fans too? It seems to work out that way, but percentage-wise, it's probably,

18:16.840 --> 18:23.080
well, 75%, I would say, but I should think it should be 90 in one sense. And I feel it shows

18:23.080 --> 18:27.860
that we do have at least 25% membership of people who just are interested in poetry altogether,

18:28.720 --> 18:34.200
which is healthy. I mean, we're not trying to be separate from the mainstream of literary

18:35.020 --> 18:38.520
mainstream with poetry, that's for sure. Well, you're not trying to be separate.

18:38.660 --> 18:43.800
Well, can you say a few words about what, is there a basic difference between

18:44.400 --> 18:49.580
science fiction poetry and regular poetry? Well, there's several arguments about that. I think my

18:49.580 --> 18:55.660
basic viewpoint is that it's science fiction or fantasy poetry if it's published within that

18:55.660 --> 19:01.800
genre. And because a lot of the poetry really doesn't necessarily have to have unicorns or

19:01.800 --> 19:09.800
spaceships in it, a lot of it can be about very peripheral things. I'd call them speculative

19:09.800 --> 19:18.140
things. Well, is there anything about the style that would qualify or is it simply a sub-man?

19:18.980 --> 19:23.440
Yeah, you can characterize it by the subject matter, but it doesn't have to be spaceships or

19:23.440 --> 19:29.900
unicorns, like I said. It can be about, well, have you ever picked up a telephone and heard

19:29.900 --> 19:34.680
someone talking on the line somewhere far in the distance? It's another conversation between two

19:34.680 --> 19:41.320
other people. Well, say you wrote a poem about that in the context of like there were telephone

19:41.320 --> 19:47.620
ghosts that kind of live in the telephone line, okay? That would be a mainstream poem or it could

19:47.620 --> 19:55.100
be a science fiction poem because it deals sort of in that the same realm that imagination, that

19:55.100 --> 20:02.860
fantastic imagination is in. When did you give me the start of the organization already briefly? But

20:02.860 --> 20:09.720
was this sort of an invention, this genre? Or do you look back in the past and see poets from

20:09.720 --> 20:13.740
the ancient world or previous ages who wrote this kind of poetry? Or is this something that's been

20:13.740 --> 20:19.960
recognized just recently? Well, the first form of literature was poetry and the reason for it was

20:19.960 --> 20:24.900
that they had to rhyme and meter it so that they could pass it on verbally generation to generation.

20:26.200 --> 20:31.800
And from that prose spun off, you see. So poetry is very old and one of the very early

20:33.340 --> 20:38.680
poetic epics is Gilgamesh. And if you're familiar with Gilgamesh, you might as well call that a

20:38.680 --> 20:45.280
fantasy. It had its other reasons for being written. It was an instructive, it was an instructive

20:45.280 --> 20:50.340
mythological tale, almost a fable in some ways and actually involves all sorts of

20:52.800 --> 20:57.340
instructions for the people who were listening to it as it was passed through generations.

20:57.500 --> 21:06.420
But it is fantastical in its content. Do you have, you mentioned that you read or gather sometimes

21:06.420 --> 21:11.200
at different conventions and so forth. What about recognition or awards of that sort? Do you have

21:11.200 --> 21:19.400
those? Yes, we sponsor an award. It's an annual award for the best long science fiction poem with

21:19.400 --> 21:24.080
the air and the best short science fiction poem. And the cutting line is 50 lines. If it's over 50

21:24.080 --> 21:29.280
lines, it's considered long. If it's under 50 lines, it's considered short. And the purpose we

21:29.280 --> 21:37.400
basically sponsor the award is not only recognition to poets who are normally not getting recognition

21:37.400 --> 21:42.920
within the field because poetry is basically used as a white space filler, a white hole filler,

21:44.280 --> 21:51.860
but also as a promotion. I've been seeing, this is going to have to be edited out because I'm

21:51.860 --> 21:55.760
dating the show here, but I've seen things around the convention about the Clark Ashton Smith Award.

21:55.760 --> 22:03.500
Does that have anything to do with poetry? Yes, it's a committee award. There are like

22:03.500 --> 22:10.400
eight, 10 people who supposedly have credentials about poetry and science fiction

22:13.140 --> 22:18.720
worked up an elaborate three-part system for figuring out who would be awarded poems. And

22:18.720 --> 22:25.120
it has much more categories and involves fantasy poetry. But that's not related to your organization

22:25.120 --> 22:30.360
so much. It's not related to our organization. Okay, now do professional authors belong to your

22:30.360 --> 22:36.040
group? I mean, are they part of your... Well, as far as I'm concerned, a poet that has published

22:36.040 --> 22:40.360
somewhere is a professional author. If you're considering a name author, I can name them. If

22:40.360 --> 22:44.540
you mean authors who take it seriously, there's plenty of us and a lot of us have only been

22:44.540 --> 22:49.700
published in obscure places, but we take it seriously. I assume you're saying name authors.

22:51.220 --> 22:56.140
Well, Gene Wolf's president is Ted Sturgeon, Michael Bishop,

22:58.620 --> 23:02.160
Roger Zalazny. He signed up just before he went to

23:02.160 --> 23:14.840
Ireland. Ursula K. Le Guin, Fizzy Land, David Arbunch, Edward Bryant, Gregory Benford.

23:16.620 --> 23:21.240
Do all these authors themselves, I take it, write science fiction poetry?

23:23.320 --> 23:30.920
Tom Dish. Yes, to some extent, or at least they write poetry. It doesn't matter so much in the

23:30.920 --> 23:34.180
organization whether you write science fiction poetry or not. If you're interested in science

23:34.180 --> 23:38.480
fiction and you write poetry, you know, those kind of people join too. But it is sort of...

23:39.040 --> 23:44.340
It's a gathering of people who at some point may reorganize into something different the moment

23:44.340 --> 23:47.820
we're getting to know each other and reading each other's poems and kind of

23:49.420 --> 23:56.420
making the science fiction genre and literary genres all together aware that the

23:57.620 --> 24:06.220
modern scientific thought and the mode of poetry as a literary format of explaining yourself,

24:06.660 --> 24:10.620
or creating a fiction, have come together quite well in our modern times.

24:12.420 --> 24:15.520
I take it that there's no money in this. Nobody does it for the money.

24:17.560 --> 24:22.020
Well, no, I think that's true with almost every poet in the United States. They actually,

24:22.160 --> 24:27.280
even the ones that you could name, which are professional and well known, make much more

24:27.280 --> 24:32.900
money doing university talk circuits than they do off of their own poetry books and in science fiction,

24:33.460 --> 24:39.140
most you can get for a poem is basically $25. And if you're getting published in something like

24:39.140 --> 24:45.500
Isaac Asimov's, your chances are you'd have one poem a year there. So it's a competition for what's

24:45.500 --> 24:51.460
very little white space to fill. Okay, I just lost my train of thought. I had another question.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.400
Okay, this is sort of a philosophical question.

24:59.220 --> 25:03.240
Does science fiction poetry, can you do anything with science fiction poetry, or does it offer

25:03.240 --> 25:10.360
anything that would make it special or different than normal poetry? It's gonna be a little hard

25:10.360 --> 25:13.860
to take that one off the top of my head, but I do have at least one angle I see on that.

25:15.840 --> 25:23.960
Yes, today, science has found some things about the universe, especially let's use physics as an

25:23.960 --> 25:31.460
example, or found some things because science has become so specialized. And that any scientist

25:31.460 --> 25:36.680
today is almost a specialist in this field. We're discovering the real depths of a lot of science,

25:36.840 --> 25:42.880
including psychology, but let's pick physics. Okay, if come up against things like black holes,

25:43.100 --> 25:51.260
singularities, monopoles, and these are things which cannot be systematically and rationally explained.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.960
And you will find in the scientific texts that are discussing these possibilities,

25:55.960 --> 26:02.220
and these kind of rips in Einsteinian space time continuum, or however you want to look at them,

26:02.580 --> 26:10.300
their anomalies. The science books are using, even like Carl Sagan will use a poem, for example,

26:10.400 --> 26:18.760
to help explain, to help visualize what it could possibly be or how it exists. And because poetry

26:18.760 --> 26:24.840
can in a small space deal with something which can be abstract, doesn't always have to be abstracting,

26:24.840 --> 26:30.060
doesn't have to be unreadable, and it doesn't have to be boring. But because it can deal with some

26:30.060 --> 26:38.120
things that are abstract in a small amount of space, poetry can be or poetic talk, even if it's in a

26:38.120 --> 26:47.400
prose sense, or even in a speech, can deal with with abstract things nicely. Okay, very good.

26:50.620 --> 26:54.240
The only poetry that I've been familiar with that would belong to the field of fantasy and

26:54.240 --> 26:58.820
science fiction, I think it would be the work of, say like Robert E. Howard, and so forth,

26:58.880 --> 27:02.760
he's published first. Now that, I guess, would be sword and sorcery, fantasy, whatever you

27:02.760 --> 27:09.340
wanted to call it. Does that qualify? I would qualify that as a fantasy poetry. Certainly,

27:09.420 --> 27:16.120
he was a man who was writing basically for a fantasy market, and was using the same thematic

27:16.120 --> 27:25.280
material in his poems. That qualifies. You don't want me to make a judgment on this poetry.

27:26.240 --> 27:32.660
Go ahead. I think it stinks. Okay. Anything else? You want me to quote that? No, that's okay.

27:34.960 --> 27:39.060
I don't know how to quite phrase this one. You can edit that out. Okay.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.640
Speaking of a name author for a moment, okay, a name author,

27:47.700 --> 27:51.560
I guess you'd have to make a judgment here to be a very personal kind of response, but

27:53.160 --> 27:57.160
why would that person who can make some money,

27:57.480 --> 28:03.240
spent writing short stories and novels and so forth, why would he dabble or write in poetry?

28:04.340 --> 28:09.000
Well, knowing a lot of these people that you would pick, possibly, or people we mentioned

28:09.000 --> 28:18.640
previously, a lot of them wrote poetry first, and extensively. And they seem to be people who weren't

28:18.640 --> 28:23.760
squelched in the public high school system about the boredom, the abstract, and the unreadability

28:23.760 --> 28:27.680
of poetry, and that they wrote it during their high school times and their early youth,

28:28.260 --> 28:32.600
and possibly gave up writing altogether, and then came back with an urge to write

28:32.600 --> 28:37.420
and a strong urge and a money-making urge, and went to prose and write prose well,

28:37.440 --> 28:42.160
but never have lost the interest in poetry. And also, writers just tend to write in any form they

28:42.160 --> 28:47.940
can. A lot of them don't, the name writers you're thinking of, or we're talking about don't write

28:47.940 --> 28:54.580
all that much poetry, but you know, writers write, and they'll pick any format they can in order to

28:54.580 --> 29:00.620
say what's proper, and in the style that's proper for what they want to say. Poetry is often much

29:00.620 --> 29:11.780
better for what you want to say than is prose or nonfiction. Do you have any particular titles,

29:11.940 --> 29:17.560
either of books or poems, that you think are particularly good that anybody listening might

29:18.420 --> 29:23.460
get ahold of if they would like to know more about this? I suggest a book called Holding

29:23.460 --> 29:30.080
Your Aide Hands. It's been reprinted as a paperback by Doubleday last year. It originally was

29:30.080 --> 29:35.140
published in 1969. The editor is Edward Lucy Smith, and it's a collection of science fiction

29:35.140 --> 29:41.900
poetry, an international collection actually, although not widely international as British,

29:42.160 --> 29:48.460
and I think some Australian authors and American authors in it. There's an anthology of poetry

29:48.460 --> 29:57.040
coming out from a man here in Denver, Steve Razznick-Tem, and it's an offshoot of a magazine

29:57.040 --> 30:01.080
he's been editing of speculative poetry for three or four years. It's called The Umbrell

30:01.080 --> 30:08.180
Anthology, and it will use poetry out of what I see as the history of science fiction poetry.

30:09.840 --> 30:16.160
There's also coming up an anthology in a couple of years by Bruce McAllister and Dick Allen,

30:16.320 --> 30:21.060
who are both writers of science fiction poetry, and both people who work in academic jobs in the

30:21.060 --> 30:26.560
United States, which is going to attempt to do the same thing, create a comprehensive anthology

30:26.560 --> 30:34.260
of some sort. And there is Starline, which is our newsletter, which publishes original poetry.

30:34.940 --> 30:41.180
Markets, we have a workshop in there. We have news related to science fiction and poetry.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.500
We have letter columns and everything that basically ties our organization together.

30:48.340 --> 30:52.120
There are some small literary magazines which totally focus on science fiction.

30:52.880 --> 31:00.300
Uranus comes out of Wisconsin, and there are some that that's one example of that.

31:00.960 --> 31:05.580
And then as a peripheral magazine that might be a small press science fiction magazine, but which

31:05.580 --> 31:13.500
is, uses poetry quite a bit. There's Owl Flight, which comes out of Oroville, California, I believe.

31:15.240 --> 31:23.580
Oakland, California, I'm sorry. And Aurora, which is another Madison, comes out of Madison,

31:23.780 --> 31:26.740
Wisconsin. It's a five minute science fiction magazine.

31:26.940 --> 31:30.200
Sounds like this is something that's going to catch on very fast then.

31:30.340 --> 31:36.200
Since I've been involved in it, it is caught on like Wildflower. Edit that one.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.660
Since I've been involved in it, it is caught on like Wildfire.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.880
With Isaac Asimov's an amazing using sometimes three to four poems an issue.

31:46.940 --> 31:52.120
And since about 1978, the theme anthology has become real popular in science fiction.

31:52.380 --> 32:02.120
Say on the theme of shape changing, the future at war, let's say, time travel without a spaceship,

32:02.980 --> 32:08.360
various very specific theme anthologies, and a lot of them have been buying poetry.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.260
There's one thing I didn't quite catch at the beginning. I want to ask it again.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.800
Maybe you didn't say it or maybe you didn't catch it. Who are who is the individual or

32:17.800 --> 32:21.480
individuals who was most responsible for starting the science fiction poetry association?

32:21.920 --> 32:26.360
The ladies name is Suzette Hayden Elgin. She is a professional science fiction writer who

32:26.360 --> 32:30.560
is well known and right now lives in Arkansas.
