00:01.680 --> 00:07.940
Well, Confection Gale to collect quite a few of me for 20 percent.

00:08.060 --> 00:10.200
That was around $300.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.400
It must have been for about 60,000 words a copy.

00:16.060 --> 00:23.840
One of the things I wanted to ask you about was you started off with a sort of fantasy science fiction story of Metal Man,

00:23.920 --> 00:25.960
and then you went deeply into science fiction.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.980
But one I think one of your most fascinating things that I read was darker than you think.

00:30.220 --> 00:33.120
What caused the change in your writing? What caused this?

00:33.120 --> 00:42.860
Well, I'm not sure except that people change and grow and sometimes decay and whatever.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.000
When I wrote darker than you think, I was under psychoanalysis.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.800
I was in Hollywood for the conclusion of it.

00:52.800 --> 01:01.100
I first went to a Dr. Ted at the Menager Institute in Topeka and worked with him for about a year

01:01.100 --> 01:04.400
and then broke off for a couple of years and decided I needed some more.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.640
He'd moved to Beverly Hills in the meantime and I went out there and stayed another year.

01:10.440 --> 01:21.320
The psychiatrist in the story, it's, well, reflects some of my attitudes to a Dr. Ted, I think.

01:21.320 --> 01:32.320
It's probably unfair to him to say that, but it seems to me that looking back now at the story and what it tries to say,

01:34.740 --> 01:48.620
the Will BarbÃ© starts out in terror of the forces of darkness and in the end finds his part of them.

01:48.620 --> 01:51.720
And that in a way is reflection of my own experience.

01:51.960 --> 02:02.720
That is, I can remember a time when I felt that I was involved in a strong conflict between will and emotion

02:02.720 --> 02:09.680
and I made resolutions that were difficult to keep and felt sort of divided against myself.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.520
As a result of partly of the analysis and partly of just growing up in the living,

02:15.520 --> 02:26.580
I feel that I've got to be well better integrated so that I'm not no longer so conscious of internal conflicts

02:26.580 --> 02:34.400
of wanting to do things that I don't do, of attempting to make resolutions that I won't be able to keep

02:34.400 --> 02:47.500
and so forth, I'm just having a degree of acceptance of myself, of the unconscious, of the whole human nature

02:47.500 --> 02:53.680
and so forth that I didn't have and I think that's probably the basic emotional structure of the novel.

02:54.480 --> 03:00.420
You weren't attempting then to, I mean, did you have any serious ideas about the Lecanthropy, the werewolf?

03:00.420 --> 03:03.940
That was the reason for that kind of genetic inheritance?

03:04.320 --> 03:17.780
Well, I think the Lecanthropy is an excellent or apt or whatever symbol for, let's say, the quote, dark forces of the unconscious.

03:18.760 --> 03:26.580
And I didn't certainly have any serious belief in magic or Lecanthropy or whatever.

03:26.580 --> 03:39.000
It was pure fantasy or science fiction but a fortunate invention because it was symbolic and expressive and so in its own way true.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.840
To go forward a little bit, another book I wanted to ask you about is Brother to Demon, Brother to Gods,

03:47.480 --> 03:49.820
more or less on genetic engineering and so forth.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.960
I took that book as fairly optimistic in its ending.

03:53.960 --> 03:59.160
I think it is. It was meant to be. I'm certainly interested in genetic engineering.

03:59.420 --> 04:12.380
It seems to me that, well, the big scientific event of, well, 40 years ago or whenever it happened was the splitting of the atom

04:12.380 --> 04:23.140
and the unraveling of DNA has some learned more profound consequences when we begin to realize them.

04:24.140 --> 04:33.840
And years ago I wrote a novel in which, well, so far as I know that invented the term genetic engineering,

04:33.840 --> 04:39.240
it had probably been around in other works called Dragon's Island.

04:40.040 --> 04:46.320
But that was published in 51 which was a couple of years before Watson and Crick made their great breakthrough

04:46.560 --> 04:58.240
and then more recently I decided to come back to it and to push the possibilities of genetic engineering as far as I could imagine them.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.680
Would you accept it or, I mean, is it something you're for?

05:01.680 --> 05:07.440
Well, I don't think it's a matter of being for it or not. I think it's going to happen.

05:07.680 --> 05:15.080
I think that people are going to be opposed to it and there'll be conflicts and so forth,

05:15.100 --> 05:24.780
but assuming that science and technology remain alive, I think genetic engineering is going forward.

05:24.780 --> 05:32.460
It has so many possible uses in the manufacture of insulin, the manufacture of interferon,

05:32.800 --> 05:43.420
the possibilities for, let's say, improving health and happiness and comfort and longevity are so vast

05:43.420 --> 05:47.660
that you can't imagine people refusing to do it.

05:47.660 --> 05:58.720
And if we go ahead with it, it involves the potential of improving or changing or tinkering with the human germ plasm,

05:59.640 --> 06:01.780
rebelling the race itself.

06:02.460 --> 06:14.020
And I say it's fascinating to watch and in the story, well, I set up the Smithwick family as the creators

06:14.020 --> 06:21.740
and had them recreating their own children so they would be better genetic engineers generation after generation

06:21.740 --> 06:30.960
and set up these four creations, the true man who were genetically perfect,

06:31.280 --> 06:36.040
who were happy and smart and peaceful and good citizens of society

06:36.040 --> 06:42.500
and the new man who were specialized for space or warfare or anything else.

06:42.500 --> 06:50.420
And the gods who ruled and then discovering that the gods were created a little bit too much in the image of men

06:50.420 --> 06:58.720
so that there needs to be another creation to supplant the gods and the gods naturally don't want to be supplanted

06:58.720 --> 07:07.000
and it struck me that this was, let's say, a beautiful dramatic situation with the essence of conflict

07:07.000 --> 07:19.080
and discovery and revelation where these two naked kids on the premon reservation faced with the problem

07:19.080 --> 07:24.080
of keeping alive when the gods are after them to grow up and discover what they are

07:24.080 --> 07:29.120
and make the ultimate man to replace the gods.

07:29.580 --> 07:32.520
It was just fun to do, let's say.

07:32.520 --> 07:37.040
And I wouldn't say that it's possible, but I wouldn't say it's impossible.

07:37.440 --> 07:45.140
That is, I think that it is an imaginative exploration of what could happen.

07:45.480 --> 07:52.120
Would you say in that book that man is sort of controlling his own evolution?

07:52.700 --> 07:58.480
Well, it seems to me we can control our own evolution and that in a way is not very remarkable

07:58.480 --> 08:07.200
because for many thousands of years we've been controlling the evolution of horses and cattle and dogs and so forth

08:07.200 --> 08:19.360
so that obviously human evolution can be controlled and since we're discovering, let's say, decoding the genetic message

08:19.360 --> 08:27.980
where we can do it more effectively and genetically, effectively, efficiently than it was ever done before.

08:28.780 --> 08:36.080
What about, this isn't exactly the same kind of material, but it is in a way that story on Guinevere for everybody about cloning.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.120
Is cloning something you can foresee as possible or good?

08:44.120 --> 08:51.880
Well, I can't really say any good in it, not much good anyway, but it seems to me it's possible.

08:52.340 --> 09:04.200
We can already clone frogs and with continual refinement and laboratory processes and understanding and so forth

09:04.200 --> 09:14.580
I can see cloning human beings, but our human clone, as far as I can see, is essentially an identical twin

09:15.200 --> 09:19.660
and not a sort of supernatural second self.

09:20.400 --> 09:28.220
So assuming that you had clones, it seems to me that they would have to be grown up individually and educated individually

09:28.220 --> 09:36.360
and they would not be doppelgangers or second selves or instant duplicates of the donor or whatever,

09:36.880 --> 09:45.560
but I can't see why it shouldn't happen and it seems to me that there's a possibility of using the cloning technique

09:45.560 --> 09:52.560
for example to grow a new heart that would be a perfect replacement of a normal heart

09:52.560 --> 09:56.280
because it's grown out of the same texture and such things as this.

09:56.280 --> 10:10.460
It might be possible to grow a whole series of implants and replacements that would make life go on almost essentially forever

10:10.460 --> 10:24.320
as far as I know the brain cells are not replaceable and won't live forever, so I can't see that as a real way to immortality.

10:25.300 --> 10:29.660
One more question on this particular point, say in reference to cloning or genetic engineering,

10:30.720 --> 10:37.080
would you say that there is no area of science that man can monkey with anything he wants?

10:37.220 --> 10:43.420
Is there anything which we shouldn't touch which would be wrong for science to meddle with or monkey with?

10:44.280 --> 10:48.460
Well, I suppose I'm a sort of a relativist.

10:49.420 --> 10:52.500
Maybe I'm a Darwinian evolutionist.

10:52.900 --> 11:00.460
It's hard to find any absolute symbols or standards or whatever, what is wrong and right.

11:00.760 --> 11:10.980
If you look at the whole evolutionary picture, why some things, patterns of growth and ways of behavior and so forth

11:10.980 --> 11:15.180
lead to the survival of the individual and the species and some don't.

11:15.180 --> 11:28.160
That's one available standard of behavior and if you look at that, why the technologies seem likely to survive and prevail

11:28.160 --> 11:37.600
unless they destroy themselves and whatever is going to destroy the race is obviously bad in that way.

11:37.600 --> 11:48.020
Then it seems to me when we open the atom, we're skating on thin ice and there might be similar hazards in genetic engineering

11:48.020 --> 11:53.140
that theoretically we could design a form of life that would wipe us out.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.700
Maybe we will.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.680
Maybe we need the humanoids to keep us from doing that.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.200
That's what they're for.

12:01.200 --> 12:07.620
But personally, being sort of individualist, I hate to give up completely the humanoids.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.140
There is one more work I keep forgetting about this one, the CT work, CT ship, CT shock.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.240
Is that the way that's pronounced?

12:16.440 --> 12:17.100
CT, yeah.

12:17.200 --> 12:17.880
Contraterine, man.

12:18.060 --> 12:25.200
Yes, it was abbreviated, contra-terine with the letters C and T and I just spelled it out.

12:25.200 --> 12:31.080
That was a work I did for Kamal and enjoyed doing it.

12:31.280 --> 12:39.040
I went to him with the idea for a series of stories about the planetary engineers who would terraform new worlds,

12:39.260 --> 12:48.220
that is, would rebuild them, tinker with the atmosphere, the chemistry, maybe the gravitation, whatever,

12:48.220 --> 12:50.160
to make them suitable for human settlement.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.520
Kamal suggested that some of these new worlds might be CT, that is, antimatter,

12:56.620 --> 13:03.980
which was pretty near the science fiction then and I was fascinated and I did a series of stories

13:03.980 --> 13:06.820
and then a serial that eventually became two novels.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.980
Where did you come up with the concept terraform?

13:11.140 --> 13:11.980
Did you coin that word?

13:11.980 --> 13:14.480
As far as I know, I invented the word.

13:15.540 --> 13:22.900
There are a few such terms that I think I can claim credit for such as terraforming and psionics

13:22.900 --> 13:28.600
and the android is distinct from the Robert and so forth.

13:30.160 --> 13:36.820
Didn't the CT novel and the short stories lead into a syndicated strip in the newspapers?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.500
Yeah, that was one of my exciting adventures.

13:40.500 --> 13:47.980
I was sitting at my desk one day when the phone rang and the editor of the New York Sunday News was on the line

13:47.980 --> 13:51.240
and wanted to know if I would come to New York and write a comic strip

13:51.860 --> 14:02.140
and I caught my breath and said I would and they had read one of the CT novels reviewed in the New York Times

14:02.140 --> 14:06.160
by a rather superior reviewer who said that the plot was pretty interesting

14:06.160 --> 14:12.340
but the way of writing made it look like a science fiction comic strip

14:12.340 --> 14:19.520
and this was in the early days of commercial TV when people were turning on the tube on Sunday morning

14:19.520 --> 14:25.760
instead of buying the Sunday news and somebody thought that if they had exclusive strips

14:25.760 --> 14:31.200
instead of syndicated strips that everybody else had it might give them a competitive edge.

14:31.200 --> 14:38.080
They originally planned four new comics including a Western and a Mystery and Adventure I think

14:38.080 --> 14:40.680
but the science fiction one was the only one they did.

14:41.140 --> 14:46.000
It ran for three years but eventually didn't turn out to be the answer to TV.

14:46.880 --> 14:52.220
But the artist was Leah Lass who used to work with Milk and Ifon Terry and the Pirates

14:52.220 --> 14:59.780
and has a nice clean cut style and was good with new and strange characters and good with machines

14:59.780 --> 15:11.980
and the thing was fun to do. My heart was broken when it ended because I had come to enjoy getting a regular check

15:11.980 --> 15:18.180
and it was at that time that I went back part time into the academic world

15:19.060 --> 15:23.740
because I had started taking college courses while the strip was running

15:23.740 --> 15:32.160
because it didn't take all my time to write it and I asked for a graduate assistantship and math

15:32.160 --> 15:38.400
and they didn't have one but I was stared to one in English which turned out to be a fortunate choice

15:38.400 --> 15:44.660
and the academic world did mesh very well with writing.

15:45.040 --> 15:52.640
It's wonderful to be paid to read Good Literature and talk about it with a congenial group of students

15:52.640 --> 16:00.260
and I enjoyed teaching and found that I was able to continue writing during holidays and vacations

16:00.260 --> 16:07.280
and maybe I learned a little bit more about literature and about people and so forth.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.540
I think it was a very happy experience.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.900
Didn't you also put together one of the first courses on science fiction?

16:15.900 --> 16:23.060
I think so. Mark Heligus at Colgate University wrote the first one that I knew about.

16:23.340 --> 16:33.380
That was written up in the National Observer and I took the article out and showed it to the curriculum committee

16:33.380 --> 16:38.540
and my chairman at Eastern and got approval for a course.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.280
What time was that?

16:40.280 --> 16:49.300
That was in, let's see, Heligus started his course in 62 and I started mine in 64 and taught it for a dozen years

16:49.300 --> 16:57.960
and spent part of those years doing all I could to promote academic science fiction elsewhere

16:57.960 --> 17:03.540
and accumulated descriptions of other courses and lectured and published articles

17:03.540 --> 17:10.420
and finally put together a textbook for science fiction teachers and anthology of articles

17:10.420 --> 17:17.000
by the likes of Asimov and Gwyn and Garn and others that has finally been published.

17:20.460 --> 17:26.900
I have a question about your own opinion on it. This may not be a fair question to ask of an author, but

17:29.500 --> 17:37.920
do you have favorite books, favorite stories, characters as you look back that you would say like most to be remembered for?

17:38.500 --> 17:39.680
Me in my own work?

17:39.740 --> 17:40.200
Yeah, in your own.

17:40.320 --> 17:50.360
Well, I think darker than you think is probably the novel that, as I fell into place most pleasingly,

17:50.360 --> 18:00.040
when I look back on it, it seems still to work, it's still engaging, it still means something.

18:00.720 --> 18:06.140
The humanoid has been my most successful, most widely translated novel,

18:06.360 --> 18:15.380
but the original novelette with folded hands said essentially what I wanted to say in a more compact and satisfying way

18:15.380 --> 18:21.380
so that I always felt the novelette was a better story than the novel.

18:21.620 --> 18:29.160
That in a way has been my most successful and popular work, the novelette has been reprinted many, many times.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.540
How many languages has the humanoid been translated into, you know?

18:32.660 --> 18:42.380
Well, I don't know, but most of the Western European languages and Japan and let's see, it's just going into Serbo-Croatian and Hebrew.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.680
It's gotten around.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.620
I want to ask something about your working method.

18:51.260 --> 18:56.500
When you come up with a concept for a story, you know, whatever it is, you know, CT or humanoid's whatever,

18:56.980 --> 19:01.680
do you get a concept and then find a story to fit it or do you have a story that you shove the concept into?

19:05.760 --> 19:09.200
Well, I'd like to say I think that it just grows.

19:09.200 --> 19:21.620
I often begin with some sort of abstract idea, like, well, the conflict of primitivism and progress or whatever.

19:22.120 --> 19:32.680
And I look for the essence of conflict and the basic idea and then try to find characters or forces that would embody this conflict.

19:32.680 --> 19:40.120
And in the early stages of it, why the whole thing is a very flexible, almost flimsy.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.980
You can do anything to it. You want to turn it inside out.

19:45.400 --> 19:59.420
But if it works, it gradually comes alive and the characters become real until they're human beings that I feel that I know.

19:59.420 --> 20:03.920
And it sort of changes what comes very difficult to make.

20:04.920 --> 20:11.200
I noticed looking over some of your manuscripts at Eastern New Mexico University that you do revise.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.080
It seems to me that you had revised quite a bit.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.460
Is that a normal process of your writing to go back over?

20:15.720 --> 20:16.980
Well, more and more.

20:17.220 --> 20:22.920
In the beginning, I saw myself as a pop writer.

20:22.920 --> 20:32.580
And my idols in the pop field were such figures as Max Brand, who was said to write 4,000 words every day,

20:32.620 --> 20:35.460
including Sundays, and send it out in rough draft.

20:35.880 --> 20:40.340
And in the course of his life, he's said to have published between 30 and 40 million words.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.120
And I tried to do that for years and sometimes, believe it or not, it worked.

20:47.060 --> 20:55.320
Most of my work for several years was submitted in first draft and often accepted and liked by the fans.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.460
But as time goes on, I change. The market changes.

21:01.960 --> 21:09.160
I become, I guess, more conscious of technique and ways that things can go wrong.

21:09.160 --> 21:17.820
So nowadays, when I write a paragraph, I have a tendency to take it apart and rewrite it instead of going on.

21:18.080 --> 21:24.460
Which was one reason for buying this new word processor, because it seems to facilitate the revision immensely.

21:24.980 --> 21:29.180
You compose on a monitor, and if you don't like what you see there,

21:29.180 --> 21:38.380
you can over-type it or delete it or whatever and save whatever's good without having to re-type it.

21:40.940 --> 21:48.780
How do you keep up with science? You must have a fairly extensive scientific background or any good science fiction writer must.

21:48.780 --> 21:56.000
Well, I've always been, as I said, fascinated with science as a sort of unfolding mystery.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.860
That is, I want to know as much as I can about the nature of the origins of the universe.

22:02.380 --> 22:10.180
I subscribe to a whole group of magazines, Science News, the Scientific American Science,

22:10.420 --> 22:13.980
which is the publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

22:13.980 --> 22:19.000
which is much of it pretty technical, but some things in it I can read and understand.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.260
I subscribe to a couple of astronomy magazines.

22:22.440 --> 22:27.820
I've subscribed to a couple of computer magazines since I bought the word processor.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.280
And occasionally I get off to other events.

22:32.860 --> 22:40.560
My wife and I attended the Jupiter flyby at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory March a year ago,

22:40.560 --> 22:49.840
and got a short story out of that that I called a descent into the great red spot, though I think the editor is changing the name of it.

22:50.200 --> 22:57.680
And we've been invited back to the southern flyby come November and something like that,

22:58.080 --> 23:04.500
which gives you an opportunity to see actual science at work and science unfolding,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.060
it's about as exciting as anything could be.

23:08.060 --> 23:17.420
The Jupiter flyby, the pictures of Jupiter and its satellites were coming in on the monitors, one every 48 seconds.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.300
Most of them you knew would never be seen again.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.800
They would select some for more study, but most of them would disappear.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.500
And it was just exciting.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.820
It was like exploring a new solar system.

23:34.820 --> 23:39.060
These satellites up to that time had just been spots of light in the telescope

23:39.060 --> 23:46.900
at the nearest best approaches where you could see details just a few kilometers across.

23:47.460 --> 23:59.040
Each satellite was different, with a different history, with different clues about the origins of itself and the whole solar system and maybe the universe.

23:59.780 --> 24:04.620
Things like that might make science as interesting as anything I know.

24:06.700 --> 24:14.760
To change the subject again, if I remember now, you have been president of the Science Fiction Writers Association, are you still on?

24:14.880 --> 24:24.900
I finished my second term less than a month ago and I hope now to get back to more science fiction.

24:24.900 --> 24:25.820
The term is for how long?

24:26.420 --> 24:28.400
It's term is only for one year.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.140
And it was a very rewarding experience.

24:31.780 --> 24:38.200
As I guess I've said before, Science Fiction is a pretty small, friendly, close community.

24:38.780 --> 24:47.180
A lot of people in it have been good friends over the years and it was an opportunity to try to do something for Science Fiction.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.920
But it took a good deal of time.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.720
What were your duties, if you don't mind me thinking about it?

24:52.720 --> 24:58.200
Well, there we have about 500 members.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.900
We have all sorts of activities.

25:01.420 --> 25:14.180
One of the most important is a grievance committee that tries to, let's say, avoid difficulties with editors and publishers and so forth to make sure that they treat us right.

25:14.680 --> 25:20.420
We have the Nubular Awards that are given each year to recognize work in the field.

25:20.420 --> 25:27.400
We attempt to, well, sort of publicize and propagandize Science Fiction.

25:27.860 --> 25:35.520
And there are many, many people in the organization who devote a lot of priceless time and energy to this,

25:35.620 --> 25:42.440
but the whole thing has to be coordinated and people drop out and have to be replaced.

25:43.240 --> 25:52.540
And misunderstandings develop that have to be somehow explained and new projects come along that need to be supported.

25:52.940 --> 26:07.660
There wasn't any one thing that took a great deal of time, but there was a continual flow of problems and minor decisions and so forth.

26:07.660 --> 26:18.460
So that every week I'd have to spend maybe a couple of days catching up on the mail and the phone calls and whatever.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.340
What are the criteria for membership?

26:20.860 --> 26:26.100
Does everybody automatically a member who publishes a story or does it have to make application?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.420
No, you have to make application.

26:27.420 --> 26:34.620
An affiliate member has to have at least one story professionally published.

26:34.880 --> 26:45.180
An active member, the requirement for that is three stories, short stories or short works that doesn't have to be fiction stories,

26:45.560 --> 26:48.420
or longer works such as a novel or whatever.

26:49.360 --> 26:55.500
The deal is now of $40 a year and we have two publications,

26:58.220 --> 27:07.600
between them they're monthly, a forum that is essentially for the members with official business and market reports and whatever.

27:07.600 --> 27:18.780
And a bulletin that comes out four times a year that is devoted to more general articles, background, material on science and science fiction.

27:20.500 --> 27:27.540
And the members are usually privileged to attend a self-wised week at a convention.

27:28.940 --> 27:36.820
And let's say membership is a sort of ticket to a club that I regard as exciting to belong to.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.620
You said there are some 500 members?

27:38.980 --> 27:39.020
Yes.

27:39.740 --> 27:43.840
That must be the largest, obviously the largest it's ever been.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.880
Oh yes, it is still growing steadily.

27:48.040 --> 27:54.660
The science fiction market is well until the last year or so was booming.

27:57.220 --> 28:06.000
People back publishers had regular plans to publish four, six, sometimes eight titles a month.

28:07.520 --> 28:17.520
So that Charlie Brown of Locust was keeping a record of the books published and that kept growing until the total passed a thousand a year,

28:17.620 --> 28:22.660
about half reprint and half new, including fantasy as well as science fiction.

28:22.660 --> 28:35.280
And I think that, well since the depression or whatever it was where many publishers have cut back their schedules and it's a little harder for a new writer to break in than it was,

28:35.540 --> 28:44.220
but it's still very profitable and exciting field compared to what it was.

28:44.220 --> 28:56.640
When there was one magazine I got 25 bucks for my first story and of course the big money is from films and TV and such things.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.980
I know you said it's hard for you to keep up with everything that's being published today,

29:01.140 --> 29:08.540
but do you have any particularly favorite authors, the younger ones starting in the last ten years or so that you think are going to be valuable?

29:08.540 --> 29:15.260
Well, I don't follow well enough to say anything very intelligent.

29:15.980 --> 29:32.540
When I was teaching I regarded Ursula Le Guin's left hand of darkness as probably the best recent novel and I'm a great admirer of Heinlein,

29:32.540 --> 29:40.920
especially the early Heinlein Arthur Clark, but I don't really keep up.

29:41.000 --> 29:56.020
I just read and re-read some of Gordon Dixon's Child Cycle and impressed with a broad optimistic view of human change and evolution that he's presenting.

29:56.460 --> 30:00.180
What about new wave authors? I guess the new wave technically has passed.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.940
What was your response to that?

30:03.160 --> 30:17.500
I felt that the new wave was, well, I had a new wave because I felt that the new wave people were, first of all they were intensely pessimistic about science

30:17.500 --> 30:30.540
and they were trying to throw out the traditional accepted literary patterns that at least were accepted by me and used in the field

30:30.540 --> 30:42.580
and turning back to literary experiments by people like Dose Pisces and James Joyce that had been tried a generation ago and were brought on as they were something new again.

30:43.200 --> 31:01.520
But I think by and large, well let's say some of the new wave writers were very able and the impact of the new wave has been to improve the well-awareness of literary values of style and so forth.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.420
So by and large it's been a good thing.

31:04.420 --> 31:14.780
Is it possible to blend, say, the mainstream or the new wave attempt with good science fiction? Are they mutually exclusive or is it possible to have good mainstream material at science fiction?

31:14.820 --> 31:32.220
Well, I'm not enthusiastic about consolidating mainstream literature and science fiction, but I also remember that there was a time when science fiction wasn't walled off in a category by itself

31:32.220 --> 31:49.700
and I don't think there's any reason it should be. When Wells was publishing his stories, they were just novels or romances or whatever and the science fiction was in a sort of ghetto, quote, ghetto for a generation.

31:49.700 --> 32:09.240
I think this was partly due to the fact that he was published in pulp magazines and people looked down on the pulps. I think we're sort of getting over that, but it's still a category, a publisher's category, like westerns or gothics or love romances or whatever.

32:09.240 --> 32:34.440
And that means that if Don Wilhelm or Judy Lynn Del Ray or someone else packages a book in a recognizable science fiction package, it'll sell enough copies to make a profit, but it's a limited profit because it is shelved in the science fiction racks and the stands and the general public doesn't see it.

32:34.440 --> 32:54.960
So people who get to be best sellers, successful, people like Viny Gutt and so forth, tend to want to get the science fiction label off their stories when they begin to sell enough copies, but I've never reached that stage myself.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.280
I'm proud to have mine called science fiction.

32:58.620 --> 33:12.280
Well, you mentioned the general public. Probably the general public wouldn't be included as say fans of science fiction. Is science fiction always going to be a separate thing? Is it still separate where you have to be a member almost of a cult or an in-group to a...

33:12.280 --> 33:41.580
Well, let's say some science fiction is, I think one thing, the most important thing that's happened to the field is the diversification of it. Instead of having one readership, we have many readerships and there's, let's say, a limited group that are interested in, let's say, the possibilities of hard science in a serious look at science fiction to explore possibilities

33:41.580 --> 33:59.060
of future social evolution, cultural change, the psychological impact of new technologies or whatever. And there are more people who are interested in characterization and story value and maybe literature has escaped.

33:59.060 --> 34:27.260
So I think that we won't just have one science fiction, but many varieties of it, but it seems to me that as far as I can see ahead, there should be a public far quote science fiction just as there still is for westerns or mischies or other identifiable categories.

34:29.060 --> 34:44.400
You don't see a more, say comparing it, you're uniquely qualified to do this. Say comparing the readership of science fiction today with, say, back in the 30s or early 40s. Wouldn't you say a greater proportion of the population reads and appreciates science fiction?

34:44.400 --> 35:08.400
I think so. When I started, nobody knew what it was. You had to explain it. There was one science fiction magazine, though some science fiction stories were running in magazines like Galaxin. People like Wells and Conan Doyle had been publishing occasional science fiction, not for a specialized audience, all along.

35:09.160 --> 35:25.020
But certainly there are more people reading it now than there ever were before. But there are a lot more people who see it on TV or see science fiction movies than ever read any of it.

35:25.020 --> 35:45.220
When you go to a convention these days, where the Star Trek fans and the comic book fans and the Star Wars fans and so forth, sort of outnumber the science fiction fans. A couple of weeks ago I was at a convention in Phoenix that was attended by, I think, about 800 people.

35:45.980 --> 36:07.520
I was really the only identifiable hard science fiction writer there. There were Star Wars characters and there were comic books authors and so forth who had the big public. I'm no complaint about that.

36:07.520 --> 36:13.420
You don't think that hurts the kind of science fiction that you value more? Say the movies, the television, that kind of material?

36:13.420 --> 36:31.900
Well, movies have very seldom been good science fiction. There have been a few good science fiction films, but the science fiction or the sort I like has been called a literature of ideas and to some extent it is.

36:31.900 --> 36:49.760
And the films, I think, necessarily deal not in ideas but with emotions, with sensation. I just saw The Shining and I liked it as a superb piece of filmic craftsmanship.

36:49.760 --> 37:10.780
I think that Kubrick wanted to scare the socks off the audience and by and large he did about as well as anybody ever will. There are people who feel that he neglected characterization and feel that the explanation of the supernatural is not consistent, but I feel that Kubrick knew what he was doing and he did it.

37:11.560 --> 37:33.080
Considering consistency, it seems to me that he was making a deliberate appeal to the irrational, to the inexplicable, to the totally mysterious. If he tried to explain all the ghosts in the old hotel where he would have been letting down the suspense at the same time, I love it.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.860
Do you think there have been any successful science fiction movies?

37:37.080 --> 37:57.500
Well, 2001 I think was tremendous. There are a number of others that are regarded as classics, but typically the movies and TV haven't done what might have been done.

37:57.500 --> 38:11.580
In the first year or two of Star Trek they were buying professionally published science fiction stories or stories written by professional writers and I thought many of them were pretty good.

38:11.580 --> 38:26.220
Gradually as time went on they went more and more into the standard Hollywood format and had less and less originality, creativity and so forth.

38:28.820 --> 38:50.000
Space, 1999 and Battlestar Galactica are worse. They have plenty of money for all sorts of expensive, special effects, but they have a contempt for the intelligence of the audience.

38:50.000 --> 39:04.640
They don't care about ideas, about consistency or whatever. All they're trying to do is create an emotional effect that if you know too much science or care too much about believability, why the emotional effect doesn't work.

39:05.220 --> 39:17.200
I'm about to ask a very broad question so you can feel free to edit it down to a better size. What do you think goes into making a good science fiction story?

39:18.100 --> 39:38.920
Well, of course I'm something I'll believe in myself in emotional effects. That is you need a strong conflict and you need something that will involve the reader emotionally so that you need characters that he can either hate or identify with.

39:40.220 --> 39:51.000
You need some sense of originality. You need, if you get it, something new, though that isn't always possible.

39:51.000 --> 40:19.060
I tend myself to look for a theme for some sort of significant statement about science or the future or the impact of science and technology on individual human beings, on human life, on society, on what the world might be.

40:21.820 --> 40:36.040
I think all of it is important for the writer to be genuinely interested in what he is saying about something relevant to science and technology and change.

40:36.040 --> 40:58.000
It seems to me the essential thing is probably that science fiction recognizes that the world is changing under the impact of technology. The future is going to be different and the mainstream audience either doesn't know this or prefers to forget it or whatever.

40:58.780 --> 41:08.980
That's a good distinction to make. I was going to ask you, is that something you presented in your classes when you taught science fiction that it's concerned with change and distinction of mainstream material?

41:11.240 --> 41:23.080
Speaking of your teaching, why do you think science fiction, say, is far down as junior high, junior high, high school, college? Is there any particular value it can offer students?

41:23.920 --> 41:40.280
Well, I think that, assuming that science fiction does deal with change, the world is really changing. So the recognition of this is an element of reality or realism that you don't have in a lot of classic literature.

41:40.800 --> 41:51.800
And kids growing up were going to be living in a world that's different from the world around them now. It seems to me they have a legitimate interest in what the future is going to be.

41:51.800 --> 42:06.140
And in a practical teaching situation, you're trying to pull kids off the playground out of the front of the TV and teach them to read and to understand and to think.

42:06.820 --> 42:23.880
And sometimes this is pretty difficult. I've tried various approaches to various literary figures and periods, and some of them work very well and some of them don't.

42:23.880 --> 42:43.460
And it seems to me that science fiction offers a sort of bridge or a door or whatever to the interest of a lot of students that you don't have if you try to go back to Shakespeare, let's say.

42:46.400 --> 42:57.140
Yeah, I think one thing science fiction forces a person who's reading it to do is to think about the future and to think about the world that he's living in as it's related to the future.

43:24.460 --> 43:27.120
I think that's basically what it's about really, as much as you can say this about anything.

43:27.120 --> 43:46.340
A human being is a helpless victim of his environment and his own nature or that he can make significant decisions and change his environment and make things better than they were.

43:47.800 --> 44:04.200
That was basically the approach I took in my classes, beginning, I like to begin with the second two books of Gallivish Progress, which is written as deliberate criticism of the early scientists of the Royal Society and so forth.

44:04.200 --> 44:29.080
And to present as far as I could, selected stories that would be brief on both sides, dystopias and jute-topias, optimism and pessimism, selection from such people as Well-Clarke and Heinlein and so forth on one side and made my own humanoid.

44:29.080 --> 44:40.340
There's plenty of dystopian fiction, usually better written and more engaging than the optimistic science fiction.

44:40.440 --> 44:52.920
Well, though, if you're going to categorize like that, say you put Welles and Huxley and Swift, maybe Ellison on the one hand, maybe Heinlein, Asimov, people like that on the other, I would put you on that side.

44:53.360 --> 44:57.580
The second side was the optimist or the utopians, ultimately, even though you did write the humanoid.

44:57.580 --> 44:59.400
Well, that's where I'd like to be.

45:00.320 --> 45:00.920
That's fair.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.540
Hey, but I only got one more question I'm done.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.860
The tape's brought out too.

45:10.100 --> 45:18.320
Maybe I misinterpreted some of the you wrote, Dr. Williamson, but I thought I read somewhere where you were skeptical of the possibility of finding intelligent alien life elsewhere.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.920
No, I don't think I read.

45:21.480 --> 45:31.560
Well, I'm skeptical about our actually finding it because the universe is so vast and communication is so difficult.

45:31.820 --> 45:36.000
There's two chains of probability or whatever.

45:36.000 --> 45:48.220
It's been proven that the stuff of life originates elsewhere, even in galactic clouds before there are any planets.

45:48.820 --> 45:56.260
So the stuff of life is there and life could theoretically develop on any planet.

45:57.360 --> 46:03.580
According to the best theories, where the galaxy is full of planets, so it ought to be there.

46:03.580 --> 46:12.140
But on the other hand, we have a record of evolution for four and a half billion years or whatever in the solar system,

46:12.140 --> 46:15.520
and there's no evidence that anything alien ever turned up here.

46:16.340 --> 46:24.980
And at our best speed so far, it would take many thousand years to get to another world.

46:24.980 --> 46:32.700
And I'm just skeptical that the flying saucers are interplanetary visitors of whatever.

46:33.560 --> 46:44.920
But I can see a possibility of radio communication or picking up radio signals or laser signals or something else.

46:45.320 --> 46:53.720
But it also seems that this would have to go at the speed of light, which takes 100,000 years to cross the galaxy.

46:53.720 --> 46:59.160
So any very intimate conversation would take a lot of time.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.780
Well, you've invented a couple ways for people to go faster than I have, haven't you?

47:03.020 --> 47:03.240
Yes.

47:04.780 --> 47:11.000
A very fond of Jerry Feinberg for the invention of the taekyeon that I've adopted.

47:12.040 --> 47:22.260
And I've invented other devices of my own, and I regard these as necessary for, let's say, pieces of fictional machinery.

47:22.260 --> 47:25.200
But I'm not sure they're going to work in reality.

47:26.360 --> 47:37.040
People keep saying that the Einstein speed of light limit is not absolute, but there's a good deal to be said for it in practical terms.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.520
But to summarize, in other words, you wouldn't...

47:40.520 --> 47:45.600
You're not skeptical about the existence or the possibility of intelligent light, just that we would be able to contact it.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.840
Right, that's it.

47:47.520 --> 47:51.020
I don't see why it shouldn't be there.

47:51.020 --> 48:00.900
Of course, there's a sort of appalling possibility that an evolving species opens up the atom and commits instantaneous suicide,

48:01.280 --> 48:03.760
but you can hope that wouldn't always happen.
