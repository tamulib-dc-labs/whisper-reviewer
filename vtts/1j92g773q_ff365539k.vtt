00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
[Music.]

00:30.000 --> 00:32.866
[Tom Turbiville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.886 --> 00:33.987
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.844 --> 00:38.729
[Tom Turbiville]: Look up Marine in the dictionary and you might just see a picture of Jim West.

00:38.749 --> 00:39.590
[Tom Turbiville]: Well, you certainly should.

00:40.131 --> 00:44.837
[Tom Turbiville]: This former Madisonville police chief spent nearly three years as a ground fighter in Vietnam.

00:44.857 --> 00:47.680
[Tom Turbiville]: Didn't come home until he'd been wounded three times.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.744
[Tom Turbiville]: Jim West was not a spit and polish kind of Marine at all.

00:50.764 --> 00:55.310
[Tom Turbiville]: He was a fighter who didn't mind bending a rule or two if it meant protecting his fellow Marine.

00:56.051 --> 01:00.837
[Tom Turbiville]: You would go to war anytime with this Brazos Valley veteran, and you're about to find out why.

01:00.857 --> 01:01.898
[Tom Turbiville]: Welcome, Jim West.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.395
[Tom Turbiville]: to veterans of the valley.

01:03.475 --> 01:06.037
[Tom Turbiville]: It is indeed an honor to have you and to know you.

01:06.078 --> 01:07.959
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's talk about your early years.

01:07.979 --> 01:16.307
[Tom Turbiville]: You were born and raised near Muskogee, Oklahoma, and when you were just barely out of high school, you decided to join up in 1959, join the Marines.

01:16.727 --> 01:19.710
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk a little bit about that decision, why you decided to join up.

01:19.730 --> 01:31.480
[Jim West]: Well, I got tired of milking cows from the folks on the dairy farm, and I went out and ventured out into the steel to work in the machine shop or whatever.

01:31.882 --> 01:57.990
[Jim West]: learn a trade and they had the steel strike in 59 so two or three of my buddies said Wes let's just go into service well my two heroes my two cousins they had 
fought in Korea one came out of the Chosen Reservoir with the 1st Marine Division and one fought with the 1st Cav in the Battle of the Yellow River and he was captured and I studied these

01:58.493 --> 02:05.341
[Jim West]: men through my aunts and uncles, and it gave me the esprit de corps.

02:06.523 --> 02:07.264
[Tom Turbiville]: Indeed.

02:07.284 --> 02:09.146
[Jim West]: I joined the Marine Corps in 1959.

02:09.927 --> 02:14.653
[Tom Turbiville]: You told me your dad was a World War II vet, your uncles were veterans, your family worked for Douglas Aircraft.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.094
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

02:16.595 --> 02:28.129
[Jim West]: All the men was fighting in the war, and the grandparents took care of us on the farm, and the women, they worked at Douglas Aircraft Company, driving rivets and welding and helped the war effort.

02:29.054 --> 02:36.809
[Jim West]: And sometimes they brought some German prisoners out to work on the farms to help while the men were fighting.

02:36.829 --> 02:41.558
[Jim West]: And that gave me an understanding of what my country is all about.

02:41.779 --> 02:43.041
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

02:43.061 --> 02:48.532
[Tom Turbiville]: You said your dad sent you a toy B-17 bomber and you got to play with that and that sort of gave you the itch also, right?

02:48.572 --> 02:48.832
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

02:48.852 --> 02:50.235
[Jim West]: He sent that back from England.

02:51.245 --> 03:03.717
[Tom Turbiville]: First duty station was in Hawaii, and this was 1959, really, before a lot of people had heard of what was going on in Southeast Asia or Vietnam or Laos or any of those countries, at least people in the United States.

03:03.737 --> 03:06.700
[Tom Turbiville]: So when you first started out, you were over in the Pacific area.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.503
[Tom Turbiville]: I know you spent some time in Okinawa and Borneo.

03:09.563 --> 03:12.245
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about sort of the days before Vietnam.

03:12.265 --> 03:20.273
[Jim West]: Well, I got an assignment to Hawaii for three years, and everybody in my

03:20.675 --> 03:27.181
[Jim West]: Graduating mattoon got a little upset because everybody says, well, that's one of the greatest places to have a good time.

03:27.281 --> 03:40.333
[Jim West]: And then all at once, we got a, I guess you'd call scuttlebutt that there was something happening over in Southeast Asia, especially Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

03:41.014 --> 03:46.879
[Jim West]: But we was not told that we had advisors already in Vietnam.

03:46.899 --> 03:48.741
[Jim West]: So they changed my orders to Okinawa.

03:49.463 --> 04:02.822
[Jim West]: I went into anti-tank weapons section, and from there we made landings in the Philippines, went to North Borneo where they had an insurrection of Indonesian rebels.

04:02.882 --> 04:16.261
[Jim West]: We're kind of messing with the Dutch colony, so they sent us there with the Australian and British Royal Marines, and we scared them back up in the mountains and stayed there for about almost a month and a month and a half.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.285
[Jim West]: And that was called the SEATO pact.

04:19.568 --> 04:19.868
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.514
[Jim West]: And it's kind of like the NATO pact, but it's called SEATO pact.

04:23.774 --> 04:32.046
[Jim West]: We had certain Oriental nations there that was combined in our effort to keep communism kind of at bay.

04:33.649 --> 04:39.457
[Jim West]: And then we slowly got scuttlebutt that the Vietnam was starting to turn into a crisis.

04:39.477 --> 04:39.597
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

04:39.617 --> 04:46.808
[Jim West]: Due to we had Marine and Army and Special Forces in there as advisors and

04:47.193 --> 04:50.557
[Jim West]: I felt the feeling that we was going to have trouble.

04:50.577 --> 04:52.459
[Jim West]: And the Marines are always first to fight.

04:52.639 --> 04:54.762
[Jim West]: We're the presidents own.

04:54.782 --> 04:59.567
[Jim West]: Some people call us the presidents Doberman Pinchers, and he's success on them.

04:59.587 --> 05:11.161
[Jim West]: When anything in America has trouble with our freedom, our own lives, whatever, to help other people that want to be free.

05:12.322 --> 05:16.727
[Jim West]: And then the Chinese started shelling the island of Kamui, which is Taiwan.

05:17.416 --> 05:39.498
[Jim West]: long-range artillery so we had a FMF pack fleet marine force we went up there and cruised around a little bit to let China know that if they tried to invade we would protect the island of Formosa which everybody calls Taiwan because we had interest in that as a kind of a territorial.

05:39.618 --> 05:46.765
[Jim West]: After the Korean War that's the people who enjoyed the American way of life moved to Taiwan and

05:47.183 --> 05:49.065
[Jim West]: Communists took over the main island.

05:49.586 --> 05:57.735
[Tom Turbiville]: I want to get you to Vietnam in a little bit, but before Vietnam, I guess in 1962 or so, there was a Cuban crisis.

05:57.755 --> 05:57.975
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

05:57.995 --> 06:01.699
[Tom Turbiville]: And I know that you were involved in the state of Florida in that.

06:01.719 --> 06:03.501
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk a little bit about that.

06:03.521 --> 06:11.950
[Jim West]: Well, I had my 15-month tour in the Orient, and all at once I got orders to report down in Florida.

06:13.211 --> 06:16.515
[Jim West]: And it was a base that required a...

06:16.765 --> 06:17.867
[Jim West]: top secret clearance.

06:19.048 --> 06:32.768
[Jim West]: So the unbecoming of me being a combat man, and I love my grunt attitude, or what are you going to call it, Marine Corps, I went down there and received a top secret clearance.

06:32.888 --> 06:39.718
[Jim West]: And my mother wrote me a letter and said, son, how come the Navy intelligence people has come to my house, our house,

06:40.610 --> 06:46.098
[Jim West]: and wanted to know if you had any records of school records, report cards.

06:46.118 --> 06:49.383
[Jim West]: Well, my blessed mother kept them in an old cedar chest.

06:50.645 --> 06:57.235
[Jim West]: So she let them have them and they went and talked to some of my school teachers and everything before I knew it, I had a top secret clearance.

06:58.210 --> 07:02.920
[Jim West]: And then we had the nuclear weapon in the film being taken at Cuba, flying in.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.080
[Jim West]: We protected that and took care of that in the security part, which was not really being able to explain some of that stuff.

07:13.381 --> 07:21.936
[Tom Turbiville]: 1963 or thereabouts, you'd been in for four years, and you had a decision to make, whether you were going to go back to Oklahoma and get a job, or whether you were going to stay in the Marines.

07:22.297 --> 07:22.477
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

07:22.497 --> 07:23.960
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that decision to stay.

07:23.980 --> 07:34.698
[Jim West]: Well, my four years was up, and I was extended a year by President Kennedy for the Cuban crisis, and that's coming up 15 days prior to getting out on five years.

07:36.101 --> 07:37.363
[Jim West]: I was going to be a...

07:37.782 --> 07:43.028
[Jim West]: Get in school of the Highway Patrol, Oklahoma Highway Patrol, because they were kind of a breed of their own.

07:43.048 --> 07:46.712
[Jim West]: A lot of former Marines and Special Forces.

07:47.493 --> 07:55.902
[Jim West]: And I enjoyed them because I had a young man that was a good friend of mine that played baseball, football with me, that became a Highway Patrolman.

07:55.922 --> 07:57.964
[Jim West]: And I'd see him when I came home on leave.

07:59.206 --> 08:00.507
[Jim West]: And I used to ride with him.

08:00.527 --> 08:07.435
[Jim West]: And my sheriff, Dave Faulkner, would debutize me and take me sometimes with him.

08:08.005 --> 08:10.410
[Jim West]: when I was on home and on leave.

08:11.492 --> 08:23.718
[Jim West]: So law enforcement started kind of coming through my mind and my feelings about that's my job, to protect and serve, even in the Marine Corps or back in the States.

08:23.738 --> 08:27.887
[Jim West]: But my major and my sergeant major, who I played tennis with my major,

08:28.846 --> 08:38.635
[Jim West]: in Pensacola, Florida and other places when we had a chance and they took me out and we got a little social inebriated at a golf course and I shipped over for six years.

08:39.336 --> 08:56.271
[Jim West]: So I become a Marine and full hearted and I felt why should I give up five years of my life when I knew the job and I enjoyed it and it made me feel good to be kind of doing a job for my country and our way of life.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.982
[Jim West]: They sent me to drill instructor school.

08:59.503 --> 09:08.933
[Jim West]: But my shipping over, I wanted to go to guerrilla warfare school because I knew something was going to happen in the back of my mind in Southeast Asia.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.015
[Jim West]: I felt it come over me.

09:11.035 --> 09:17.362
[Jim West]: I don't know if it was just something that I read about or whatever.

09:18.704 --> 09:24.250
[Jim West]: And I remember friends of mine I was serving with who was in Cuba when Castro took over in 59.

09:25.242 --> 09:32.430
[Jim West]: when the Marines were down there and they were told not to go on liberty because Castro took over and Batista flew out to Spain.

09:34.092 --> 09:36.814
[Jim West]: And then I was assigned to the drilling truck to school.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.717
[Jim West]: I was there, went through the school.

09:39.738 --> 09:43.942
[Jim West]: But yet my feelings was I didn't want to instruct Marines.

09:44.042 --> 09:44.843
[Jim West]: I wanted to fight.

09:45.784 --> 09:50.369
[Jim West]: I wanted to be in the front lines as most Marines, you know, you're first to fight.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.072
[Jim West]: So they sent me to Europe.

09:53.761 --> 09:58.127
[Jim West]: And I went over there with the Fleet and Marine Force.

09:58.147 --> 10:03.315
[Jim West]: And we landed in Palma, Spain, Madrid, Spain, Genoa, Italy, Toulon, France.

10:04.096 --> 10:13.390
[Jim West]: I was on a flagship with a Commodore and his Fleet Admiral on the USS Sanctuary.

10:13.657 --> 10:16.161
[Jim West]: Felt like then I wasn't a seagulling Marine.

10:16.781 --> 10:21.248
[Jim West]: They call us Leathernecks because we wore the old leather back in the 1700s.

10:21.788 --> 10:26.856
[Jim West]: But I was more of a hard-nosed Marine.

10:27.637 --> 10:29.159
[Jim West]: I felt it inside of me.

10:29.179 --> 10:37.691
[Jim West]: So they sent me to the Drill Warfare School, come back, and I went through Fort Sherman, Panama Canal, Green Berets, where I had instructors.

10:38.692 --> 10:40.395
[Jim West]: And from there, I went to Vietnam.

10:41.616 --> 10:42.718
[Jim West]: But I had this talent.

10:42.968 --> 10:50.382
[Jim West]: that I knew what enemy we was going to fight because our country never really understood guerrilla warfare, I don't believe.

10:51.504 --> 11:01.782
[Jim West]: But the Marines fought in the Banana Wars in Cuba way back in the 1920s or 30s or whatever.

11:01.802 --> 11:05.449
[Jim West]: So I could read that history, also going through the training.

11:06.205 --> 11:12.051
[Tom Turbiville]: You spent some two and a half years in Vietnam, and as we said from the outset, you were seriously wounded three times.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.993
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.835
[Tom Turbiville]: You earned three Purple Hearts.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.276
[Tom Turbiville]: You took two of them, I believe.

11:17.537 --> 11:18.017
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

11:18.037 --> 11:20.220
[Jim West]: I did not want my mother to suffer.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.002
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that if you can again.

11:23.022 --> 11:24.484
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about that the other day.

11:25.165 --> 11:35.115
[Jim West]: Well, I had a corpsman I was hit with shrapnel in the arms, and I said, Doc, don't you ever give me another Purple Heart unless I'm in a body bag because my mother,

11:35.365 --> 11:38.628
[Jim West]: I felt more about her than I did myself.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.791
[Jim West]: So he agreed with me.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.934
[Jim West]: He looked at me one time and that's all he needed to say.

11:45.035 --> 11:48.298
[Tom Turbiville]: You didn't want that car to pull up in front of your mama's house again.

11:48.578 --> 11:49.759
[Tom Turbiville]: No, I can understand that.

11:50.160 --> 11:54.484
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about when you were wounded, the first time that you were wounded.

11:54.504 --> 12:00.590
[Jim West]: Well, the first time I was wounded, we had Viet Cong hitting convoys.

12:01.190 --> 12:03.853
[Jim West]: I was at High Van Pass, just about

12:04.525 --> 12:08.511
[Jim West]: Oh, 60 miles from Da Nang on Route 1 going to Hue City.

12:09.171 --> 12:18.564
[Jim West]: And a lot of the convoys was coming through there was Arvin and the local VC was hitting them pretty bad, ambushing them.

12:18.585 --> 12:26.696
[Jim West]: A friend of mine, Sergeant Kent, was down at the Esso plant where Brown and Root opened it back up after the French shut it down.

12:26.716 --> 12:27.597
[Jim West]: And he had a

12:28.538 --> 12:36.487
[Jim West]: PF, we call PFs, Preventional Forces, who were brought into the South Vietnamese Army as security in villages.

12:37.148 --> 12:40.672
[Jim West]: Well, he had that attachment with four Marines.

12:40.692 --> 12:42.154
[Jim West]: He was killed that night.

12:42.214 --> 12:50.083
[Jim West]: They ambushed him, and he was talking to me on the radio, and I was farther up up the hill, but I could not go to help him.

12:50.103 --> 12:55.069
[Jim West]: And he was shot twice in the back, and while he was still talking to me on the radio.

12:55.876 --> 13:00.281
[Jim West]: So I knew then something was going to happen up in our area.

13:00.301 --> 13:07.869
[Jim West]: And one day I come back and we had a kind of a chow hall there with Hawk missile sites just above us and we had their protection.

13:08.570 --> 13:13.296
[Jim West]: And we also had the guard dogs running through the fence at nighttime helping us.

13:14.957 --> 13:19.943
[Jim West]: And the Viet Cong come out on the road and knocked out three

13:20.581 --> 13:24.745
[Jim West]: South Vietnamese trucks with RPG rounds and machine guns.

13:24.765 --> 13:29.310
[Jim West]: And I had a 50 up there on the hill, so I cut down on the 50 on them.

13:29.330 --> 13:33.374
[Jim West]: And the Arvin lieutenant and warrant officer was hollering at me.

13:33.575 --> 13:36.758
[Jim West]: I mean, I couldn't hear them hollering, but they was waving their hand to help them.

13:36.778 --> 13:39.501
[Jim West]: So I just turned the 50 on them, the enemy.

13:40.021 --> 13:45.407
[Jim West]: And they presented me with the Vietnamese cross of Gallandry with POM.

13:46.298 --> 13:51.424
[Jim West]: And then when we went down there to check them, we found eight Arvinds dead and three wounded.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.328
[Jim West]: And we got them medevaced.

13:54.949 --> 13:59.414
[Jim West]: So they gave me an honor over it, which to me, I was just doing my job.

13:59.654 --> 14:01.136
[Tom Turbiville]: You weren't fighting for medals?

14:01.156 --> 14:01.677
[Jim West]: No, sir.

14:01.697 --> 14:05.361
[Jim West]: I was fighting for their way of life and ours to be free.

14:05.381 --> 14:06.142
[Tom Turbiville]: Exactly.

14:06.162 --> 14:07.063
[Tom Turbiville]: Exactly.

14:07.083 --> 14:11.749
[Tom Turbiville]: We're going to take a pause here and take a look at some pictures that you gave us.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.516
[Tom Turbiville]: from your time in Vietnam and even afterwards.

14:15.597 --> 14:21.065
[Tom Turbiville]: We'll go ahead and go to those and let you talk about each one of them, some photographs.

14:21.085 --> 14:22.948
[Tom Turbiville]: I think we're ready to go right now.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.154
[Tom Turbiville]: This is a photograph that I took a photograph of.

14:26.194 --> 14:28.337
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about what we're looking at there.

14:30.342 --> 14:36.932
[Jim West]: That's taken right outside of Da Nang there, what they call Happy Valley or Arizona Territory.

14:38.214 --> 14:40.838
[Jim West]: And I was 26 years old there.

14:40.858 --> 14:45.124
[Jim West]: I was a platoon sergeant of Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines.

14:46.306 --> 14:57.363
[Jim West]: And that's what we tried to help the South Vietnamese, where the Viet Cong come at night and they threaten to kill the women and children if they didn't fight for them.

14:57.383 --> 14:58.645
[Jim West]: So we tried to protect them.

14:59.603 --> 15:09.906
[Jim West]: We're in the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese because Charlie, the VC, always come in and took part of their food or took ransom from them.

15:10.788 --> 15:14.997
[Jim West]: So we guarded them and I had a combat photographer and he took that picture.

15:15.263 --> 15:16.044
[Jim West]: And put it together.

15:16.064 --> 15:21.251
[Jim West]: And I had it developed in Okinawa, and I pulled back there to pick up new replacements.

15:21.271 --> 15:24.155
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on to the next one.

15:24.175 --> 15:28.921
[Tom Turbiville]: This is a picture that's shown a little wear and tear over the year, but there's a Marine West.

15:29.141 --> 15:38.073
[Jim West]: That's a machine gun that was involved in saving a few Marines' lives in Vietnam, and a combat photographer wanted to take that picture.

15:38.093 --> 15:44.882
[Jim West]: And that was taken on the USS Okinawa, LPH landing platform, HILO, that was a World War II

15:45.605 --> 15:49.591
[Jim West]: Aircraft carrier for prop planes.

15:49.611 --> 15:51.694
[Jim West]: So he gave me a copy of it.

15:53.436 --> 15:56.020
[Jim West]: And that's when I was still pretty good and strong.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.904
[Jim West]: When I'd been shot up too bad or busted up.

16:00.426 --> 16:01.508
[Tom Turbiville]: All right.

16:01.528 --> 16:05.313
[Jim West]: That's what we call in Vietnam.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.558
[Jim West]: They had Catholic little churches.

16:08.578 --> 16:10.601
[Jim West]: And you can see most of the bullet holes around there.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.844
[Jim West]: That took us about a week to clear that out.

16:13.752 --> 16:17.816
[Jim West]: And I told my men to make me some coffee.

16:17.976 --> 16:22.079
[Jim West]: If you look over there to the left, you can see where they're brewing me some Hobo Joe.

16:23.140 --> 16:28.025
[Jim West]: If nobody's ever had any Hobo Joe, it's coffee grounds we'd get from the artillery people.

16:29.026 --> 16:33.730
[Jim West]: We'd take C4 explosives and burn a little of it, and it'd boil the water in a flash.

16:34.610 --> 16:43.118
[Jim West]: We'd drop one hand of coffee in it, and then one little shot of cold water, and the grounds went to the bottom, and we had coffee, Hobo Joe.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.152
[Jim West]: So that's what these other men are doing, Marines.

16:46.292 --> 16:47.134
[Tom Turbiville]: Very resourceful.

16:47.655 --> 16:50.541
[Jim West]: And the combat photographer wanted to take a snapshot of me.

16:50.561 --> 16:52.003
[Jim West]: He says, I look like G.I.

16:52.063 --> 16:52.404
[Jim West]: Joe.

16:53.606 --> 16:55.370
[Tom Turbiville]: Got the camouflage going.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.712
[Jim West]: I had a cigar in my mouth.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.798
[Jim West]: I guess playing the role.

17:00.139 --> 17:00.600
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

17:01.272 --> 17:02.093
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about this.

17:02.113 --> 17:11.925
[Jim West]: Now, this is when I got inventory up on my feet and my commanding general, General English, asked me what job I'd like to have until my next surgery.

17:11.945 --> 17:14.227
[Jim West]: And he said, Marine liaison.

17:14.247 --> 17:16.550
[Jim West]: I said, yes, sir, I'll take it.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.533
[Jim West]: And then were my three clerk typists.

17:18.953 --> 17:27.263
[Jim West]: And we went up to a young man who was having a real bad problem with his life because he was paralyzed from the waist down.

17:28.053 --> 17:38.332
[Jim West]: And we'd heard word that he might have tried to attempt something on his life because his fiancée come to see him, she never came back.

17:40.256 --> 17:41.739
[Jim West]: I guess it was due to his wounds.

17:42.600 --> 17:49.774
[Jim West]: And we were trying to build him back up into understanding, and finally when he was able to get in the wheelchair, we took him out and had a beer with him.

17:50.463 --> 17:53.366
[Tom Turbiville]: We're going to talk about that aspect of your career a little bit later.

17:53.386 --> 17:58.591
[Jim West]: And the girls enjoyed going up there and talking to him and building his spirit back up.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.273
[Tom Turbiville]: Yes, sir.

18:01.293 --> 18:09.201
[Jim West]: And there, when I was working at Marine Liaison, the commanding commandant of the Marine Corps, he came in to visit us.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.622
[Jim West]: And he had a little talk with us.

18:10.682 --> 18:19.390
[Jim West]: And there's some of the officers he's checking there that flew the F-4 Phantoms that were hit and wounded in the arms and legs from shrapnel artillery.

18:20.045 --> 18:27.775
[Jim West]: or anti-tank guns or whatever they used to knock them down.

18:27.795 --> 18:36.505
[Jim West]: And the officers had the quarters up at the sixth floor and we took care of them, made sure they got their pay and whatever till they recovered.

18:36.525 --> 18:40.530
[Jim West]: And most of the officers wanted to run around with us grunts and drank with us.

18:40.550 --> 18:48.280
[Jim West]: And they'd like to go down to staff club and have a hoorah with us because they knew that the grunts were down there really fighting.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.596
[Tom Turbiville]: You can see your left hand there, this bandage.

18:50.616 --> 18:51.137
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

18:51.277 --> 18:52.319
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm still working on it.

18:52.379 --> 18:53.781
[Tom Turbiville]: Including this picture.

18:53.801 --> 18:54.923
[Jim West]: That's President Kennedy.

18:55.704 --> 19:02.536
[Jim West]: I was an MP at the time, and I got the chance to kind of guard the crowd while he made his tour through.

19:03.537 --> 19:07.864
[Jim West]: And that was the last time he was able to walk the grounds.

19:10.990 --> 19:11.871
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on.

19:13.538 --> 19:19.007
[Tom Turbiville]: There's a very familiar figure on the left side of that photo, and you're in the middle talking about San Diego, right?

19:19.027 --> 19:19.187
[Jim West]: Right.

19:19.207 --> 19:24.856
[Jim West]: I had the Naval Hospital, the Admiral, wanted me to present the GI Joe Award to Bob Hope.

19:24.876 --> 19:31.646
[Jim West]: But due to my wounds there, I could not handle, at the time, my left hand.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.412
[Jim West]: So we talked to Sergeant Franson.

19:35.847 --> 20:05.466
[Jim West]: that he'd do it and uh there was let's see i think four of us there that some of them were just the survivors out of the whole platoon the whole platoon was wiped out but the dock there and a corpsman and a few other ones right so they was given that at padre island in san diego and the owner of padre ball team walked up and gave me 700 free tickets for all the wounded marines to go to the ball

20:06.172 --> 20:10.217
[Jim West]: He gave me a press tag where I could set up with the press and all that.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.100
[Jim West]: But I was in a lot of pain then.

20:13.161 --> 20:16.184
[Jim West]: I didn't participate in a lot of that stuff.

20:16.685 --> 20:17.466
[Tom Turbiville]: That's a great picture.

20:17.726 --> 20:20.289
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, I think we've got, there's the wrestling.

20:20.309 --> 20:31.082
[Jim West]: There's when I, A&M coach there, went to A&M, and he was a captain in the Marines, and he was a coach, and that's my lieutenant I'm getting ready to slam on the mat.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.947
[Jim West]: And I had a pretty good time of keeping a,

20:35.281 --> 20:40.466
[Jim West]: heavyweight championship going for a while there until I said that was enough.

20:41.987 --> 20:44.089
[Jim West]: My first sergeant didn't like jockstrapers.

20:44.109 --> 20:51.195
[Jim West]: He wanted us out in the field training all the time instead of playing what you call the high school games or the kind of stuff.

20:51.916 --> 20:54.758
[Jim West]: He was known in World War II and Korean vet.

20:54.778 --> 20:57.681
[Tom Turbiville]: This is later on when you were at Madisonville?

20:57.701 --> 20:57.961
[Jim West]: Right.

20:57.981 --> 21:04.967
[Jim West]: There's my good buddy there next to President Bush who was running for governor the second time.

21:05.386 --> 21:22.389
[Jim West]: He was a county judge down in Beeville, and he was my youngest Marine in my battalion in Vietnam, and he was wounded, shot through both hips and lost six foot of his intestines, and they built him hips back up, and they can do miracles nowadays.

21:22.409 --> 21:26.114
[Jim West]: And we was together in a hospital down in Corpus Christi Naval Hospital.

21:26.775 --> 21:33.925
[Jim West]: So he got up on his feet, made county judge, and George W. Bush come down there to the Big Kings Ranch,

21:34.765 --> 21:37.950
[Jim West]: And Beeville and all them people, we had 3,000 people there.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.151
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

21:39.171 --> 21:45.220
[Jim West]: And we had the big Texas barbecue, my first introduction to a Texas barbecue.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.546
[Jim West]: And George W. wanted to shake hands with me and talk to me a little bit.

21:50.647 --> 21:54.533
[Jim West]: He asked me what he should do to win the governorship.

21:54.613 --> 21:58.058
[Jim West]: And I said, sir, there's an old saying about the Marine Corps.

21:59.059 --> 22:03.085
[Jim West]: You promise three things and do them, you'll survive.

22:03.554 --> 22:08.527
[Jim West]: But if you promise 15 or 20 and can't accomplish them, you're lost.

22:08.547 --> 22:10.973
[Jim West]: So that's a word I had to say to him.

22:10.993 --> 22:12.658
[Tom Turbiville]: That's a good advice.

22:12.678 --> 22:13.159
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay.

22:14.945 --> 22:17.307
[Jim West]: And there's all the badges I wore.

22:17.327 --> 22:19.669
[Jim West]: There's one badge I don't have there.

22:20.030 --> 22:25.895
[Jim West]: That's assistant chief badge because I never got it back from the city.

22:26.135 --> 22:36.124
[Jim West]: But there's a patrolman, sergeant, chief, deputy, and chief constable, chief deputy constable.

22:36.144 --> 22:42.069
[Tom Turbiville]: And this was your law enforcement in Madison County was really your career up until just a few months ago.

22:42.089 --> 22:43.531
[Jim West]: 23 and a half years.

22:43.691 --> 22:44.051
[Tom Turbiville]: Indeed.

22:44.452 --> 22:44.952
[Tom Turbiville]: Indeed.

22:44.932 --> 22:47.995
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's go back to Vietnam, if we can.

22:48.015 --> 22:53.219
[Tom Turbiville]: I want to talk after your first injury, when you were first wounded.

22:53.239 --> 22:59.725
[Tom Turbiville]: You got the word that your unit was moving out and wanted to know whether you were going to stay in the hospital or whether you were going to go.

23:00.565 --> 23:03.888
[Tom Turbiville]: And contrary to the doctor's orders, you went.

23:03.908 --> 23:04.388
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

23:04.408 --> 23:05.990
[Jim West]: I was in the Charlie Med.

23:06.851 --> 23:10.133
[Jim West]: We call it just B Med or Battalion Med.

23:10.714 --> 23:14.517
[Jim West]: But we call it Charlie Med just for Marine Corps jargon.

23:14.918 --> 23:18.764
[Jim West]: And the doctor told me, he says, you now, you're going to stay in your bed.

23:19.025 --> 23:21.068
[Jim West]: You've got a drain in your leg from the wound.

23:21.929 --> 23:28.901
[Jim West]: I'll give you a chit for two beers at the little old club that the Vietnamese, we gave them see ration to make us.

23:28.921 --> 23:32.947
[Jim West]: So I had my two beers and the old sergeant was running it.

23:32.967 --> 23:36.172
[Jim West]: I said, no, two beers for a platoon sergeant ain't enough.

23:36.192 --> 23:36.974
[Jim West]: I need at least four.

23:38.656 --> 23:39.638
[Jim West]: So I'd have four beers.

23:40.780 --> 23:41.601
[Jim West]: So...

23:42.205 --> 23:43.006
[Jim West]: I got on the horn.

23:43.447 --> 23:52.498
[Jim West]: I got the word that my unit was moving up to Khe Sanh, and I didn't want to be left behind because I'd be transferred over to another unit.

23:53.579 --> 23:57.885
[Jim West]: So I got on the Lima Lima line, cranked it, and got to my what we call a land line.

23:59.166 --> 24:06.255
[Jim West]: Got a hold of my first sergeant and my skipper, captain, said, send your jeep and come get me.

24:07.957 --> 24:11.962
[Jim West]: And the Jeep showed up about an hour, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or whatever.

24:12.222 --> 24:13.443
[Jim West]: I didn't keep time on that.

24:13.463 --> 24:20.291
[Jim West]: And he showed up, and I just got in the Jeep, and my doctor, Lieutenant Commander, hollered, I'll court-martial you, Marine.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.034
[Jim West]: I'm not responsible if you lose that leg.

24:24.856 --> 24:29.242
[Jim West]: So I said, Lieutenant Commander, what are you going to do, shave my head and give me another tour of duty?

24:30.143 --> 24:32.445
[Jim West]: And I told the driver to take off.

24:32.465 --> 24:33.326
[Tom Turbiville]: And you saluted him?

24:33.667 --> 24:34.027
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

24:34.047 --> 24:36.630
[Jim West]: And I said, all due respect to your title and your rank, sir.

24:37.505 --> 24:44.031
[Jim West]: And I had my corpsman pull out a little bit of the drain and cut it off so it healed from the inside out.

24:44.051 --> 24:52.218
[Tom Turbiville]: Believe it or not, we're starting to get low on time, but I want to talk about the last time that you were wounded, wounded in the shoulder, and that's wounds that you still deal with today.

24:52.298 --> 24:53.239
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that.

24:53.299 --> 24:57.963
[Jim West]: We landed up at the Gill Inn and Conti Inn by the DMZ.

24:58.383 --> 25:04.509
[Jim West]: We call it the McNamara Line because we had a barbed wire all across it in towers.

25:05.490 --> 25:06.010
[Jim West]: Well,

25:06.226 --> 25:13.254
[Jim West]: North Vietnamese B-24th B Division moved in and they had overrun Bravo 1-9.

25:14.655 --> 25:17.418
[Jim West]: And if you ever heard of Bravo 1-9, you read it.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.684
[Jim West]: They call it the Death Battalion because they lost so many people.

25:24.026 --> 25:25.688
[Jim West]: But they killed Ho Chi Minh's son.

25:26.709 --> 25:35.018
[Jim West]: So the word came out to North Vietnamese to always find out where Bravo Company 1-9 was and try to annihilate them because of that

25:35.521 --> 25:37.263
[Jim West]: what they did and they killed Ho Chi

25:37.283 --> 25:37.864
[Jim West]: Minh's son.

25:38.985 --> 25:52.360
[Jim West]: Well we went up there to help them and the second platoon landed in Hilo area Sparrow and we come in Hilo area Canary and they had almost been overrun completely.

25:53.441 --> 26:01.410
[Jim West]: So they were wearing marine flight jackets and marine helmets to try to keep us from distinguishing them from our men.

26:02.285 --> 26:09.399
[Jim West]: And all at once, machine gun opened up, and they rushed us, and it was just slowly trying to take out as many as they could.

26:10.441 --> 26:18.657
[Jim West]: And I got my platoon down, and I got hit in the arm, three rounds in the pack, one through a canteen, one in a magazine pouch, and it exploded.

26:19.582 --> 26:23.428
[Jim West]: And it's like something picked me up and just shook me like firecrackers going off in me.

26:23.968 --> 26:29.296
[Tom Turbiville]: Jim, this has gone way too quickly, but I know that from there you had to leave Vietnam.

26:29.316 --> 26:30.238
[Tom Turbiville]: You went to San Diego.

26:30.278 --> 26:33.522
[Tom Turbiville]: We talked a little bit about how you were a liaison with other Marines.

26:33.602 --> 26:38.209
[Tom Turbiville]: Your career continued as you were even a contestant on the dating game.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.892
[Tom Turbiville]: And you met many a Hollywood star.

26:40.012 --> 26:49.065
[Jim West]: I met Jonathan Winters, Don DeFord, Charlton Heston, who was the president of the Theater Guild.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.995
[Jim West]: David Jensen.

26:51.015 --> 26:56.340
[Tom Turbiville]: Not only did you meet them, but the honor was for them to meet you.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.322
[Jim West]: It was motivation.

26:58.662 --> 26:59.783
[Tom Turbiville]: And it's our honor to meet you, too.

26:59.803 --> 27:01.204
[Tom Turbiville]: And I'm sorry that we are out of time.

27:01.224 --> 27:02.766
[Tom Turbiville]: But thank you, Jim West, for your service.

27:02.786 --> 27:03.246
[Jim West]: Yes, sir.

27:03.346 --> 27:04.087
[Jim West]: It's my pleasure.

27:04.127 --> 27:05.208
[Tom Turbiville]: Thank you.

27:05.228 --> 27:06.369
[Jim West]: I'm young and strong.

27:06.489 --> 27:07.911
[Jim West]: I'll be 66 this year.

27:08.391 --> 27:15.458
[Tom Turbiville]: Jim West and his wife, Mary Beth, live in rural Madison County, where family pictures hang on the wall and memories of his service remain pretty clear.

27:15.927 --> 27:25.278
[Tom Turbiville]: If it weren't for those wounds he suffered 30 years ago, he says that even at the age of 66, he'd volunteer to fight in Iraq for his country and the freedoms we all enjoy.

27:25.298 --> 27:32.086
[Tom Turbiville]: We salute Jim West for his military service and his civil service, and we thank all veterans, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:32.467 --> 27:37.333
[Tom Turbiville]: You can read other stories of veterans in the Brazos Valley in Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:37.793 --> 27:39.355
[Tom Turbiville]: For Jim West, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:39.375 --> 27:41.698
[Tom Turbiville]: We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:41.698 --> 27:50.723
[Silence.]

27:50.723 --> 28:20.000
[Music.]
