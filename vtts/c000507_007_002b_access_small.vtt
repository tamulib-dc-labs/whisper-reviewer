00:01.100 --> 00:05.040
I know the answer to this too because I heard you say it, but anyhow, I know the listeners

00:05.040 --> 00:05.860
are going to want to know this.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.520
At the end of White Gold Wielder, it seems like Covenant's dead.

00:12.940 --> 00:13.700
Can you bring him back?

00:14.460 --> 00:17.900
Well, you know, I always want to say gone but not forgotten.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.780
One of the things that happens in the course of White Gold Wielder is that I work very

00:23.780 --> 00:29.400
hard to establish the idea of people who come back from the dead.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.600
Now in the first trilogy, there's a really crucial point which involves the breaking

00:34.600 --> 00:35.640
of the law of death.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.500
And this is one step along the path.

00:38.640 --> 00:46.720
What this means is that somebody in our life with enough power can essentially bring up

00:47.240 --> 00:48.460
ghosts to serve them.

00:49.080 --> 00:56.920
Or can ghosts can affect or communicate with or be present to the living now because the

00:56.920 --> 00:58.000
law of death has been broken.

00:59.220 --> 01:06.900
But that's not, of course, the same thing as they're being fully present or as they're

01:06.900 --> 01:11.920
being as effective as the living or of their being to impose their wills or of their being

01:11.920 --> 01:12.780
physically corporeal.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.480
I mean, there's all kinds of degrees to these things.

01:14.480 --> 01:20.420
What happens, among other things, Ian White Gold Wielder is that another barrier gets

01:20.420 --> 01:21.160
broken down.

01:21.360 --> 01:27.540
Hyle, Troy, Ian and Laint brings Holly and back from the dead.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.100
Now there are various requirements which have to be present.

01:32.240 --> 01:38.400
There is an intact physical body, you know, Sundar kept her body with him so they have,

01:38.420 --> 01:41.820
you know, a body in which she can be reincorporated.

01:41.820 --> 01:47.240
And the dead spirit is then refused into the body.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.560
And this is crucial because it makes possible Covenant's victory at the end.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.720
I mean, Covenant defeats Lord Fowle after he's been killed.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.500
Well, you know, this character isn't going to disappear at this point.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.540
He is strong enough to beat Lord Fowle after he's dead.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.660
You know, he's not gone.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.860
And besides, after the whole thing's over, he's the one who's having a conversation

02:09.860 --> 02:10.820
with Linden and explain.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.840
Now, this is a subtle point, but it's important.

02:14.020 --> 02:19.340
At the end of the power that preserves, Covenant has a kind of a little conversation with

02:19.340 --> 02:22.500
the creator during the transition back to the real world.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.060
Now, it's when Linden goes back to the real world, it's Covenant that she's having a

02:28.060 --> 02:29.140
little conversation with.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.720
This is not a trivial development.

02:34.460 --> 02:38.540
It has, you know, it has a lot of implications for what may happen in the future in these

02:38.540 --> 02:42.360
stories in terms of the adjustment of roles, which is taking place.

02:43.720 --> 02:50.600
But I also did it to remind people again and again that Covenant's body has been

02:50.600 --> 02:52.620
killed and in terms of the real world, he is dead.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.960
But in terms of the land, you know, that spirit lives.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.600
His friends were alive when he got to the land.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.380
And if there's a future in which Linden Avery goes back to the land, there's no reason why

03:04.380 --> 03:05.420
Covenant isn't going to be there.

03:06.100 --> 03:13.580
And so the door is open for me to do what I may want to do in the future if I ever decide to do it.

03:14.520 --> 03:19.340
What about this debris statement on the, I don't know, I guess the success of your books?

03:19.420 --> 03:22.880
I can't think of maybe except with the possible exception of Tolkien, any other fantasy books

03:22.880 --> 03:23.980
that have been successful with yours.

03:24.620 --> 03:31.920
Well, I think that's true that, except for Tolkien, there hasn't been another one.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.160
Now, you have to keep these things in perspective.

03:35.860 --> 03:39.580
By and large, I sell probably 10 times as much as the average fantasy book.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.420
And by and large, Tolkien sells about 10 times as much as I do.

03:42.940 --> 03:46.600
You know, so there's still Tolkien and capital letters, and then there's me and fine print.

03:47.640 --> 03:53.740
But it is true that these books have been more popular than most other fantasy that comes out

03:53.740 --> 03:59.120
these days. And it's difficult to explain that in a lot of ways, because there are an awful

03:59.120 --> 04:01.980
lot of good writers out there writing nowadays who are doing fantasy.

04:01.980 --> 04:07.080
I always talk about Patricia McKillop, and she's done a trilogy, the Herittle Master series.

04:08.640 --> 04:15.580
She's an astonishing writer, does wonderful work, and I will never be able to explain to you

04:15.580 --> 04:17.600
why my books are so much more popular than hers.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.340
But there are certain kinds of things that I think are clear.

04:22.540 --> 04:29.760
And one of them is that I provide the epic fantasy experience that nobody else

04:30.400 --> 04:34.640
since Tolkien does. I mean, no matter what my peers are doing in fantasy,

04:35.020 --> 04:41.660
they are not doing it on this scale. And the scale puts a lot of pressure on in order to

04:41.660 --> 04:48.560
write a convincing 500,000 word novel in which people don't get bored and in which you don't

04:48.560 --> 04:53.260
lose track of what's happening and in which the writer doesn't drop stitches and forget characters

04:53.260 --> 04:59.520
and in which it all fits together in the end. You know, not everybody can do that.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.880
You can do the same thing on a short story scale. You can do the same thing on a regular

05:03.880 --> 05:08.420
novel scale when you try to stretch that to 500,000 words. For a lot of people, the fact that

05:08.420 --> 05:13.760
you're stretching, it shows. It just doesn't become, it doesn't seem natural. It doesn't,

05:14.400 --> 05:19.560
for a lot of other writers. I think my particular talent as a writer is that when you give me a

05:19.560 --> 05:26.620
canvas that big, I know exactly what to do with it. It has me to write a normal size novel and I

05:26.620 --> 05:31.960
really have to struggle because I have, there isn't enough room and so things get twisted out of shape

05:31.960 --> 05:37.540
when I try to make them fit on the picture and I can have lots of trouble trying to get a short

05:37.540 --> 05:44.560
story or a novel into focus. But you give me that much room and I know what to do. So that means

05:44.560 --> 05:49.300
that from a reader's point of view, a reader who wants to dive into something 500,000 words long,

05:49.560 --> 05:54.400
and sort of revel in it for that kind of long reading experience that you don't get from a

05:54.400 --> 05:59.620
normal novel, but you do get from Tolkien. Well, they can get that from me. It's going to be consistent

05:59.620 --> 06:04.280
and coherent and logical and it's all going to fit together and it's going to come out in a way

06:04.280 --> 06:13.060
that makes sense. And you can trust that from page one in my books. And that kind of epic reading

06:13.060 --> 06:19.860
experience, I think, is something that a lot of people yearn for. It comes rarely in life and

06:19.860 --> 06:23.880
that's one reason Lord of the Rings is so popular and that's one reason why my books are popular.

06:24.700 --> 06:29.280
Excellent. Yeah, that's very good. I hadn't thought of that, but you're right. Okay, my third one,

06:29.380 --> 06:36.700
last one. I teach a fantasy class at Odessa College. Whenever I can, I try to use quotes from

06:36.700 --> 06:42.140
authors, you know, for the students benefit. And do you have any, one thing I keep trying to teach

06:42.140 --> 06:47.640
them, tell them, convince them of the value of fantasy? Does it have a value? I mean, a student

06:47.640 --> 06:52.160
will say, also, escape literature. Forget about it. It's not the real world. Fantasy is the most

06:52.160 --> 07:02.300
fundamental form of literature in my mind. Historically, of course, it is the first form of

07:02.300 --> 07:07.560
literature. You know, when you go back to what has existed for two or four thousand years, it's all

07:07.560 --> 07:14.520
fantasy. In fact, we didn't have any other kind of literature until much more recent times.

07:15.500 --> 07:20.960
And there are reasons for that. That's because it meets a particular

07:23.380 --> 07:28.940
need and expresses a particular side of the human personality, which,

07:29.720 --> 07:34.360
which in the old days, it was so obvious that that was what stories were for and what storytelling

07:34.360 --> 07:38.700
was for that it never occurred to anybody to do anything else. Then somehow or another,

07:38.820 --> 07:43.460
we invented, we invented realism and we invented, you know, storytelling, whereas the storytelling

07:43.460 --> 07:50.280
becomes a reflection of the actual world instead of a reflection of envisioned worlds. And we've

07:50.280 --> 07:57.560
gone so far down that road in Western literature in the past 500 years that we've reached a point

07:57.560 --> 08:03.040
where we've forgotten that there used to be the literature used to do something else.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.920
But I think what literature used to do is it is something that we've lost track of not because

08:09.920 --> 08:13.960
we didn't need it, but because like everything else we got involved in what we were doing and we

08:13.960 --> 08:20.440
drifted away. There's something, there is an aspect of being human that doesn't get expressed in

08:20.440 --> 08:28.000
realistic prose. The fact is, if we're awake 18 hours a day, we spend 17 of those hours in a fantasy

08:28.000 --> 08:34.200
world. Now, what I mean is very simple. Our imaginations, whether we're conscious of using

08:34.200 --> 08:40.460
them or not, are the fundamental tool with which we cope with the real world. You're sitting here

08:40.460 --> 08:45.700
listening to me talk and you're trying to decide what your next question is going to be. That's

08:45.700 --> 08:53.700
fantasizing. You figure out, you know, I'm late people in another room will be doing this and so

08:53.700 --> 08:59.360
for which I should have been there five minutes ago. That's fantasizing. When I get home, my wife's

08:59.360 --> 09:04.840
going to yell at me, but I'm going to tell her off. That's fantasizing. You know, everything we do,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.360
we prepare ourselves for situations, we figure out, we solve problems, we do everything by using

09:09.360 --> 09:15.400
our imaginations by fantasizing. And of course, when we're asleep, we're ruled by fantasy. The

09:15.400 --> 09:23.300
fantasy making impulse on a part of human beings is our fundamental survival trait. And it is

09:24.580 --> 09:30.700
one of the key things that makes us human. And you try to find a literature that deals with that

09:30.700 --> 09:40.980
in a realistic mainstream. That is an aspect of who we are that gets lost when you start writing a

09:40.980 --> 09:46.520
literature that focuses on reflections of the real world. Now, I wouldn't, you know, I don't claim for

09:46.520 --> 09:50.200
a second that those reflections aren't terribly valuable. And it's a good and strong thing that

09:50.200 --> 09:55.800
we have realistic literature and whatnot. But it's not the whole story on literature. It's not

09:55.800 --> 10:02.600
the whole story on human beings, either as human beings or as readers. When you start writing good

10:02.600 --> 10:09.220
fantasy, what you're doing is you're trying to turn the focus of your fiction around from the world

10:09.750 --> 10:19.300
back into the human mind. And you're trying to reach down into things buried in each of our

10:19.300 --> 10:25.260
imaginations that we all have in common. You're trying, essentially, good fantasy deals with

10:25.260 --> 10:30.720
the imagination itself. And if I had to, you know, come up with a one word definition of what magic

10:30.720 --> 10:34.900
is in the Chronicles of Topsicopin, I would say that magic is imagination.

10:37.780 --> 10:42.580
That's what good fantasy novels deal about from Lord of the Rings to my books to Patricia McKeil

10:42.580 --> 10:48.040
to anything else. It deals with the side of being human that dreams and fantasizes and which

10:48.940 --> 10:53.420
solves problems, among other things. The difference, of course, in a fantasy is that

10:54.760 --> 10:59.980
probably the problems can be solved. Whereas in the real world, although you invent a solution,

11:00.100 --> 11:03.880
it turns out not to fit the circumstances and the circumstances can sometimes overwhelm you,

11:03.880 --> 11:08.540
anyways. But still, if you weren't inventing those kinds of solutions, if you weren't fantasizing

11:08.540 --> 11:13.280
in your real world, you would be dead already. The human race would have died out, you know,

11:13.740 --> 11:21.880
half a million years ago. Somebody fantasized using a club to bring down game. And so that little

11:21.880 --> 11:27.740
branch of, you know, eight man didn't starve to death. Somebody fantasized taking this smoldering

11:27.740 --> 11:31.640
kind of thing and, you know, putting a little more wood on it and building it into a fire and

11:31.640 --> 11:37.880
driving back heat and doing something with food and whatnot. And the human race didn't starve to

11:37.880 --> 11:44.580
what bloody physically ill equipped to cope with the world that animals cope with. We don't have

11:44.580 --> 11:48.060
the strength, we don't have the smell, we don't have the claws, we don't have the hide, we don't

11:48.060 --> 11:53.700
have them, you know, anything. How did puny little human beings become the dominant species on this

11:53.700 --> 12:00.620
planet? Because we got an imagination. People fantasize possibilities and those turn out to

12:00.620 --> 12:06.860
be what saved your life. That's the side of being human that fantasy novels are about. And

12:06.860 --> 12:12.680
I don't think of it as escapism at all. I think of it as really looking at yourself in the mirror.

12:14.560 --> 12:19.700
Excellent. Okay. Yeah, we're gonna have to let you go. That's very fine. I mean, we could talk

12:19.700 --> 12:24.620
for hours on this, but that's fine. That's enough. That's probably two weeks more for shows. Listen,

12:24.740 --> 12:28.140
I would like to send these tapes to you. Can you give me an address or give me some care to the publisher?
