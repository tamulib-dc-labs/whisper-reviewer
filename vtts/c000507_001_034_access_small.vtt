00:10.720 --> 00:17.880
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy presented by

00:17.880 --> 00:20.260
the Perbian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.060
This is David Cruz.

00:25.060 --> 00:27.340
Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.980
Today we're going to have a close encounter with the Center for UFO Studies.

00:45.080 --> 00:48.800
I'm going to be talking with Dr. Richard Haynes, a vision researcher for NASA.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.080
Dr. Haynes is also on the scientific board of the Center for UFO Studies and he has published

00:54.080 --> 01:00.320
several books on ufology or the study of UFOs, two of which are the UFO Phenomenon and the

01:00.320 --> 01:04.620
Behavioral Scientist and Observing UFOs and Investigators Handbook.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.940
Dr. Haynes, what is the Center for UFO Studies and what does it do?

01:09.620 --> 01:19.800
The Center is a non-profit organization made up of volunteers established in 1973 to provide

01:19.800 --> 01:26.960
a place for people to come forward with their sightings without fear of publicity or ridicule.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.120
What is your connection with the Center for UFO Studies?

01:30.800 --> 01:36.280
Well, I'm a scientific board member for the Center and also one of the field investigators.

01:37.500 --> 01:47.760
The Center has approximately 35 to 40 professionals in various fields of science and we are asked

01:47.760 --> 01:50.140
then to consult on specific cases.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.980
What type of psychological effect has it had on persons who've had a close encounter of

01:54.980 --> 01:55.640
the third kind?

01:56.540 --> 02:01.480
Well, Dave, there's really been a very broad range of responses so far.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.100
A lot of people don't realize that there have been many hundreds of close encounters of

02:08.100 --> 02:08.780
the third kind.

02:09.740 --> 02:12.540
Some of them have been documented rather fully.

02:13.180 --> 02:19.720
The kinds of psychological responses people have had have ranged anywhere from fear and

02:19.720 --> 02:23.420
panic to a sense of peace and joy and well-being.

02:24.180 --> 02:31.680
I would say in general that the individual personality type of the witness largely determines

02:31.680 --> 02:33.920
the kind of response they're going to give.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.940
How conditioned are they to a stress response, for instance?

02:38.940 --> 02:49.220
Are they used to in their past experiences, social isolation or have they overcome ridicule

02:49.220 --> 02:49.880
in the past?

02:50.420 --> 02:56.200
All of these factors I think play an important role in how people will react in a CE3 case.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.180
Is there any type of particular person that sees UFOs?

03:02.180 --> 03:08.640
Well, based upon the research done at the Center for UFO Studies on what is known as

03:08.640 --> 03:15.860
UFO CAT, which stands for UFO Catalog, it's a computerized listing of well over 100,000

03:15.860 --> 03:16.600
sightings now.

03:17.100 --> 03:22.580
We don't seem to be able to find any strong relationships between personality profiles

03:22.580 --> 03:25.000
and frequency of sighting.

03:25.760 --> 03:33.240
We do find, however, that people with more education tend to be more likely to believe

03:33.240 --> 03:34.200
in UFOs.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.740
So there is a tendency there in the belief structure of persons.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.240
Is there some particular reason why a person with a higher education would tend to believe

03:42.240 --> 03:43.180
in UFOs?

03:43.600 --> 03:49.740
I don't know, but it's possible at least that in the process of becoming educated in our

03:49.740 --> 03:57.360
universities and so far, that we're exposed to a broader range of ideas and we are somehow

03:57.360 --> 03:59.140
exposed to more creative thinking.

03:59.820 --> 04:07.380
And part of that creativity might be that life does in fact exist in the outer space.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.280
In other words, planet Earth is nearly a boat of intelligent life.

04:13.240 --> 04:19.640
And if that's true then, it would suggest that the more educated people are projecting

04:19.640 --> 04:25.220
those teachings and education upon their belief structure.

04:26.460 --> 04:32.400
I think that's a very weak connection I'm sure and it would be really difficult to prove

04:32.400 --> 04:32.560
it.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.360
That's just one possible explanation.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.720
What type of work is being done on how to communicate if Earth makes contact with another

04:40.720 --> 04:41.200
world?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.940
Well, David, you phrased the question.

04:44.620 --> 04:49.720
It implies that communication won't take place until contact has been made.

04:50.040 --> 04:55.400
I think the opposite is really the case, that we would try to communicate in order to contact

04:56.180 --> 04:57.440
intelligent life elsewhere.

04:58.540 --> 05:06.240
I know of two general approaches to communication with possible extraterrestrial intelligence.

05:06.240 --> 05:14.820
One of them has to do with radio astronomy and it's called SETI or Search for Extraterrestrial

05:14.820 --> 05:15.420
Intelligence.

05:17.100 --> 05:23.740
The other has to do with UFO content using visual means and I'd like to discuss each

05:23.740 --> 05:24.720
one just very briefly.

05:26.240 --> 05:33.840
The National Aeronautics Space Administration does have a small program called SETI and

05:33.840 --> 05:42.600
in this program calculations are made and strategies are developed for aiming large

05:42.600 --> 05:48.040
diameter radio telescopes into outer space in different directions trying to receive

05:48.320 --> 05:57.460
a signal that might somehow indicate the presence of advanced intelligence out there.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.680
And so we have to make certain assumptions in doing that.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.380
Mankind does in order to make sense of the signals that do come back because those large

06:08.380 --> 06:13.900
telescopes are very sensitive and they do receive all kinds of static and noise and

06:13.900 --> 06:14.340
so forth.

06:14.580 --> 06:21.080
And so when the computer processes that static and noise, it looks for patterns and particularly

06:21.780 --> 06:32.620
patterns which might be intelligently produced like repeating patterns, like some coded signal,

06:33.220 --> 06:37.500
like Morse code for instance, that would seem to have some intelligence back to it.

06:37.960 --> 06:42.440
We do know that certain kinds of star types in outer space, let's call them radiation

06:42.440 --> 06:50.700
sources, do have highly precise and repeatable patterns of frequency so that it isn't just

06:50.700 --> 06:57.900
the repeatability which is important because natural sources as I'm saying that could produce

06:57.900 --> 06:58.100
those.

06:59.140 --> 07:05.800
I do know in the other realm of course talking about UFOs, I do know of an effort near Austin,

07:06.000 --> 07:14.940
Texas of a ground site operated by a group called Project Starlight International and

07:14.940 --> 07:20.540
you may have heard of those people Dave, they've set up a large diameter circle of lights,

07:20.660 --> 07:27.780
flashed lights on the ground and then they have them sequenced so that they come on sequentially

07:28.500 --> 07:35.260
around the diameter circumference of the circle and the organizers of that group believe that

07:35.260 --> 07:39.800
this is one way to try to attract attention to UFOs.

07:39.800 --> 07:51.220
Well this is just part of a larger effort to obtain objective data from the UFO that

07:51.220 --> 07:54.480
might fly into the area being attracted by that light signal.

07:55.220 --> 07:59.160
Did the Center for UFO Studies help Steven Spielberg with his movie Close Encounters

07:59.160 --> 07:59.900
of the Third Kind?

08:01.040 --> 08:07.500
Well Dave, the scientific director at the Center for UFO Studies, Dr. J. Allen Heineck

08:07.500 --> 08:13.280
was a scientific consultant on that movie but I don't know whether or not the files

08:13.280 --> 08:17.880
of cases at the Center were opened up for use in the movie or not.

08:18.860 --> 08:22.200
Could you explain the differences between the different types of close encounters?

08:23.700 --> 08:33.280
Yes, the close encounter of the first kind is defined as a UFO sighting which the object

08:33.280 --> 08:39.000
or phenomenon seen is relatively near the eyewitness and by relatively near we mean

08:39.000 --> 08:41.980
on the order of 0500 to 1000 feet.

08:42.640 --> 08:49.940
Because of that distance then it's usually involving the craft or large object of some

08:50.880 --> 08:56.440
angular size like if you hold your fist out at arm's length for instance and then look

08:56.440 --> 09:00.660
at your fist the object could be like that large or even larger.

09:00.660 --> 09:06.940
Now in a close encounter of the second kind you have about the same kind of distance away

09:06.940 --> 09:13.740
from the witness. However the object or phenomenon does some physical changing to the atmosphere

09:13.740 --> 09:20.520
or the ground. It might leave impressions in the ground for instance or it might break

09:20.520 --> 09:27.460
full-range the tree branches as it comes down. It might leave radiation in the soil, it might

09:27.460 --> 09:30.180
dehydrate the soil or mat down the grass.

09:31.420 --> 09:36.340
Now those are both to be distinguished from a close encounter of the third kind of which

09:36.600 --> 09:42.140
I think most of us are familiar with now from the movie. Those are again close encounters

09:42.140 --> 09:49.780
in terms of distance but in this case the witness reports seeing a humanoid, one or more humanoid

09:49.780 --> 09:51.460
associated with the craft.

09:51.460 --> 09:58.740
Now these particular terms were developed some time ago by Dr. Heineck as a result of

09:58.740 --> 10:01.120
his extensive UFO research over the years.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.020
Do you do field investigations for the center?

10:05.100 --> 10:11.540
Yes I do. I'm one of approximately 10 or so people in the San Francisco Bay Area.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.260
What type of work do you do in a field investigation?

10:16.560 --> 10:22.420
Well Dave it really depends on the nature of the sighting itself and each case is very

10:23.100 --> 10:28.580
different. I've never found two that are alike actually. And so the approach that we

10:28.580 --> 10:34.220
take would really depend on the number of witnesses, how far away it is, what kind of

10:34.220 --> 10:40.840
case it is, let's say a close encounter of the second kind. We would have to go prepared

10:40.840 --> 10:47.480
to take soil samples and radiation tests and residual magnetism tests and so forth.

10:48.100 --> 10:54.840
So I can't give you a specific answer there. I would like to however give you some idea

10:55.800 --> 11:02.460
of a case I'm working on right now which in high speed relates to an anomalous kind of

11:02.460 --> 11:09.840
event and it involves a pilot. You may have read several years ago about a 20 year old

11:09.840 --> 11:16.260
private pilot who's flying from Melbourne, Australia to a small island in the ocean south

11:16.260 --> 11:25.040
of Australia called King Island. He was flying a Cessna 182 long range model by himself and

11:25.040 --> 11:31.200
he took off before sundown and planned to land at King Island just approximately at

11:31.200 --> 11:39.820
sundown. He was about six minutes flying time out over the ocean from Cape Otway to

11:39.840 --> 11:47.400
when he reported by radio to the flight service at Melbourne that he saw some traffic, air

11:47.400 --> 11:53.580
traffic at his approximate altitude which was about 4500 feet. Everything seemed normal

11:53.580 --> 12:00.420
in terms of his engine operation and the weather was perfectly clear. This was his second

12:00.590 --> 12:06.420
night flight and he was gaining instrument time for commercial light. Another reason he

12:06.420 --> 12:13.760
was going down according to the data I've collected is to buy fish at King Island from

12:13.760 --> 12:20.560
the fishermen there to bring back for a RAF officers party that we're going to have

12:20.560 --> 12:26.920
shortly. So he had two reasons to be out that night. Well he comes back on the radio and

12:26.920 --> 12:32.860
makes a request of Melbourne to find out if there are any airplanes in his vicinity because

12:32.860 --> 12:39.380
he sees four bright, quite landing lights coming towards him and he assumes it's a military

12:39.380 --> 12:47.080
plane. Well to make a long story short the tape record which has been transcribed and

12:48.280 --> 12:54.540
then released to the public by the Department of Transport lasts for about 12 minutes and

12:54.540 --> 13:01.360
has him describing a very strange phenomenon of flying objects outside his airplane which

13:01.360 --> 13:08.200
he describes as being long and metallic with a green light on it which does a number of

13:08.200 --> 13:14.780
things. It approaches him from different directions, it hovers on top of him, it orbits about him

13:14.780 --> 13:22.020
on top and when a pilot down there says orbit it means a very tight circle or a bank, he

13:22.940 --> 13:27.900
says it's vanity which means, I take that to mean that while he was looking at it it

13:27.900 --> 13:33.360
just suddenly disappeared and then about a minute later it showed up far off in the distance

13:33.360 --> 13:40.400
and came at him again. So what I can learn from this among other things is that he is

13:40.400 --> 13:46.920
somehow the object of attention of this phenomenon. It is the single path in which case it might

13:46.920 --> 13:54.160
be a military plane. I don't think it's a military plane. The evidence that I've been

13:54.160 --> 14:00.520
able to collect from the boy's father, the boy's girlfriend, the instructors he had,

14:00.780 --> 14:07.280
the impressed classes at Moraban Airport and a great deal of other information leads me

14:07.280 --> 14:15.420
to believe that we do have here a very good candidate for a UFO sighting and I am now

14:15.960 --> 14:22.340
actually writing a full length book on the subject to document all of the details which

14:22.340 --> 14:30.440
are filling four notebooks now. It's an exciting case because at the end of the tape recording

14:30.440 --> 14:37.140
transmission to the ground there's a 14 second long segment, a very strange sound. It's hard

14:37.140 --> 14:43.060
to describe, I guess about the closest one to describe it is you take some empty cans

14:43.440 --> 14:50.120
and put them inside a garbage can and then shake the garbage can and they occur, what

14:50.120 --> 14:59.100
I've been able to determine is a random sequence in time and I'm in now of the process of trying

14:59.100 --> 15:06.540
to duplicate the sounds by going flying in a Cessna 182 aircraft and to make sound effects

15:06.540 --> 15:10.560
on board the plane and then transmit those to the ground and analyze the sounds with

15:10.560 --> 15:16.600
a sound spectrograph and I also have a voice stress analyzer that I'll be able to look

15:16.600 --> 15:24.760
at some other factors there. So that's one of a great number of cases which are most

15:24.760 --> 15:29.460
interesting and that happens to be the one I'm studying right now. I know the answer

15:29.460 --> 15:34.260
to this question would have to be theoretical but what type of large scale social ramifications

15:34.260 --> 15:40.040
would there be with a first contact? Well I'm sure that many people have speculated about

15:40.040 --> 15:46.160
that including science fiction authors and I'm an average reader of science fiction myself.

15:46.680 --> 15:53.020
I think it's a field for great creativity. Let me try to approach the question from a

15:53.020 --> 15:59.700
number of points of view. First of all I think that mankind is likely to go through various

15:59.700 --> 16:07.200
stages of response. The first being shock and disbelief. Second perhaps being a form

16:07.200 --> 16:16.520
of mobilization into either a fight or flight response and then later on later stages would

16:16.520 --> 16:22.500
probably be more intellectual where the Academy of Sciences of America and the Soviet Union

16:22.500 --> 16:37.180
would probably debate the issue and so forth. So we go from more an emotional response to

16:37.180 --> 16:43.780
depending on the nature of the first contact that's of course the key issue here. How mankind

16:43.780 --> 16:50.100
and how the individual man on the street would perceive the visitors. Do they come in peace?

16:50.620 --> 16:57.620
What are their intentions? Do they intend the harm? And depending on how we perceive their

16:58.700 --> 17:06.460
exposure to us would largely I think determine the individual and corporate response. Now

17:06.460 --> 17:16.060
if they came in mass with battalions of UFOs let's say or large battle wagons all off

17:17.420 --> 17:22.500
Star Wars I think the response of mankind would be quite different than if they came

17:22.500 --> 17:29.520
in small groups let's say a group of three vehicles to every capital of every nation

17:29.520 --> 17:35.740
on the planet. I think that on another level looking at this from another point of view

17:35.740 --> 17:46.440
the social ramifications of a first contact would be to force us to rethink our priorities

17:46.440 --> 17:54.700
in life. Is territoriality for instance a really a high priority or not? It would force

17:54.700 --> 18:02.000
us to take a new look at our independence or interdependency person to person. I think

18:02.000 --> 18:07.640
it would force us to take a new look at what I would call our scheme of life or our hierarchies.

18:08.180 --> 18:16.120
What's important to the individual here? I think in that realm it probably would force

18:16.120 --> 18:23.000
each individual to perhaps come to terms with himself as not being the supreme creation

18:23.000 --> 18:31.840
that some people think they are. In other words not making gods out of individuals. I

18:31.840 --> 18:36.180
think that's our concept of what is the universe and perhaps even our definition of what is

18:36.180 --> 18:43.920
infinity. And I think perhaps it would begin to force us to look at this boundary between

18:43.920 --> 18:51.120
interspace and outer space. This real surreal dimension that philosophers like to talk about.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.920
I think that such an impact would contribute, I'm sorry not impact but first contact might

19:00.920 --> 19:07.280
well contribute to our increased knowledge of ourselves and how fragile we are as individuals,

19:07.760 --> 19:17.160
both socially and psychologically. You see because of an impact in contact would challenge

19:17.160 --> 19:24.900
some long held beliefs that have been around for thousands of years. Another dimension,

19:24.900 --> 19:32.460
another way of talking about first contact might be to force us to think well maybe we

19:32.460 --> 19:37.240
now have an opportunity to leave planet earth for other realms or other planets or other

19:39.040 --> 19:45.540
worlds. Do I really want to leave the planet? Our space program is opening up this potential

19:45.540 --> 19:52.280
with a space shuttle of course that will allow us to take reasonably large numbers of people

19:52.280 --> 20:00.940
into orbit for a while up to a week at a time to begin with. So entering our psyche now on

20:00.940 --> 20:06.920
planet earth is this ability to leave if we want to. But we don't see long lines of people

20:06.920 --> 20:13.640
queuing up to leave. So with that realization we're no longer prisoners of the planet but

20:13.640 --> 20:22.260
in fact we find that we like the planet earth. It's the birthplace of life that we know of

20:22.280 --> 20:28.900
and we have no reason to leave. So what's the outcome of that but to realize it's a very

20:28.900 --> 20:35.540
fragile ecosphere, a closed environment and it's protecting us. So we better watch out

20:35.540 --> 20:41.480
what we do with the ionosphere for instance from solar ultraviolet. I think that these

20:41.480 --> 20:50.060
are all different ways that I would think of what might happen on a first contact. I'm

20:50.860 --> 20:54.820
sure that's a good question. But those are kind of organizing concepts that I use to

20:54.820 --> 21:01.240
think about first contact. Which I do by the way. Anyone that works in ufology has to take

21:01.240 --> 21:07.660
first contact very seriously and have some strategy or scenario worked out what you do.

21:08.660 --> 21:13.940
Do you think science fiction would have any value in helping prepare persons for first contact?

21:14.760 --> 21:20.820
Well again that's one of those questions I would have to answer yes and no. For those

21:20.820 --> 21:27.240
kinds of personality types that go to science fiction movies that are impressionable or

21:28.560 --> 21:36.160
let's say they have a great need to be stable in their environment and the response of the

21:36.160 --> 21:42.280
environment I would say that science fiction probably doesn't affect them as much as it

21:42.280 --> 21:50.980
would a kind of personality that has a greater need to be dynamic. To think creatively. To

21:52.380 --> 21:58.980
expose themselves to rather diverse kinds of experiences. And there are those differences

21:58.980 --> 22:06.320
of personality in the culture of course. So science fiction movies that I've seen have

22:06.320 --> 22:17.380
been largely opening up new vistas as what might exist. So whether or not I want to accept

22:17.380 --> 22:23.380
the impact on myself or not as seeing science fiction movies is really not the issue. Because

22:23.380 --> 22:29.660
very deep in my subconscious I believe is the exposure I've had to every science fiction

22:29.660 --> 22:36.160
movie in the past as well as everything else I've been exposed to in the past. So let me

22:36.160 --> 22:41.720
illustrate this with a practical example. For many years now I have been administering

22:41.720 --> 22:49.360
UFO drawing tests to people and in this test I give them a 5 by 7 inch white card and I ask

22:49.360 --> 22:59.400
them to write their age, occupation, whether or not they're male or female, whether or not

23:01.320 --> 23:06.400
they're male or female. And they'll circle the answer yes or no or a question mark if they're

23:06.400 --> 23:12.540
not sure. Then I have them turn the card over and draw a picture of what they think a UFO

23:12.540 --> 23:18.700
looks like. Well I've been doing this for many years and I have collected about a thousand

23:18.700 --> 23:25.880
drawings now from many cultures, many continents, many age groups, and occupation. What I find

23:25.880 --> 23:33.320
is the drawings made by people who claim to have seen a UFO are virtually no different

23:33.320 --> 23:39.840
than the drawings by people who have never seen one. Now what that says is that perhaps

23:39.840 --> 23:47.000
everybody has seen one, but not a real one rather than a media representation of a UFO.

23:48.020 --> 23:55.300
And to me as a psychologist I find that rather interesting data than you think about. Obviously

23:55.300 --> 24:02.080
it's a rather small sample size and I am continuing to collect drawings to see if there are some

24:02.080 --> 24:09.380
more subtle effects beginning to emerge. I have postulated that with a larger sample size

24:09.380 --> 24:14.340
I will see the difference. Is there any particular area of the country or any particular time

24:14.340 --> 24:21.540
of year where sightings are more predominant? Yes, as a matter of fact there is Dave. Based

24:21.540 --> 24:29.000
upon a statistical analysis from a UFO cat of approximately 65,000 cases at the time

24:29.000 --> 24:39.220
the study was done we find that California, the Central American states, Illinois, Indiana,

24:39.960 --> 24:47.780
Ohio, and also the North Eastern region of America, continental America, tend to have

24:47.780 --> 24:54.460
higher close counters of the first, second, third time. But we've also found some other

24:54.460 --> 25:02.800
interesting patterns that are starting to emerge that July tends to be the month of the year

25:02.800 --> 25:08.080
where the greatest number of sightings are obtained, reports are turned in I would say,

25:08.580 --> 25:17.700
and also we've found that there is more likely to be a UFO sighting between 10 p.m. and midnight

25:17.700 --> 25:25.100
than any other time of the day. And in some work that I've done on airline pilots I've found

25:25.100 --> 25:30.080
that there are two times to the day that are more likely than others for them to see a UFO.

25:31.480 --> 25:39.440
The same as before that's about 10 p.m. to midnight is the first peak of sighting frequency.

25:40.080 --> 25:45.100
But there's an interesting second peak for pilots between 2 and 3 a.m. in the morning.

25:45.100 --> 25:50.920
And so obviously this is not a finding which is related to the number of airplanes flying.

25:51.540 --> 25:56.820
I think it might have something more to do with the visibility conditions at night.

25:59.220 --> 26:04.760
Obviously if your eyes are dark adapted to the nighttime conditions and you are outdoors

26:04.760 --> 26:10.260
you're more likely to see a light in the sky obviously than during the daytime when that

26:10.260 --> 26:13.500
same light in the sky would be masked by the background brightness.

26:14.580 --> 26:20.700
So we have found some rather interesting patterns in the statistical analysis of the data

26:21.260 --> 26:26.440
but clearly we need more data to really be more sure of the finding.

26:27.740 --> 26:32.740
Could you tell us a little bit about some of the difficulties encountered in studying UFOs?

26:33.480 --> 26:40.060
One of the fundamental tenets of scientific research is that we're able to control the conditions

26:40.740 --> 26:47.180
in such a way that we can make sense out of the stimulus and then the subsequent response.

26:48.020 --> 26:53.900
Unfortunately we're not able to do that in studies of UFOs because we cannot predict when

26:53.900 --> 26:56.940
and where they're going to occur with any reliability.

26:57.880 --> 27:05.160
Now because they do occur unexpectedly in time and space I think there's an important lesson there

27:05.160 --> 27:10.420
because it means that none of us know whether or not we're going to be an eyewitness.

27:12.420 --> 27:19.520
Now since that is true I think it behooves all of us to know what to do if we should become an eyewitness.

27:19.520 --> 27:26.600
And so I'd like to just mention briefly that the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois

27:26.600 --> 27:35.220
has a telephone number which is operated 24 hours a day and we encourage people with sightings

27:35.220 --> 27:39.600
to call that number and to give the details to the person who answers.

27:41.080 --> 27:48.620
After a person has done that they may be contacted by a field investigator such as myself for further information.

27:49.520 --> 27:53.820
So let me give you that phone number at the Center for UFO Studies in Illinois.

27:54.800 --> 28:03.120
The phone number is area code 312-491-6666.

28:05.160 --> 28:10.360
If a person's interested in ufology and wants to find out more about what the Center for UFO Studies does

28:10.360 --> 28:11.940
can they write them and get some more information?

28:12.600 --> 28:25.280
Yes they certainly can. I would urge them to write the Center for UFO Studies at 1609 Sherman Avenue, Suite 207.

28:27.700 --> 28:34.080
And that's Evanston, Illinois, 60201.

28:34.820 --> 28:40.340
Anyone who does write to the Center should ask for a list of publications of the Center.

28:48.960 --> 28:58.000
Remember if you see something that you believe to be a UFO you can call the Center for UFO Studies at 312-491-6666.

28:58.480 --> 29:06.020
Or you can write to them at the Center for UFO Studies, 1609 Sherman Avenue, Suite 207,

29:07.040 --> 29:11.060
Evanston, Illinois, 60201.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.460
This is David Cruz.

29:21.020 --> 29:21.620
Darrell Lane.

29:21.900 --> 29:22.680
And David Carson.

29:23.440 --> 29:29.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

29:29.280 --> 29:33.720
in conjunction with KOCB FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
