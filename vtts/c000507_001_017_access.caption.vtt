00:01.060 --> 00:09.660
An evening for James Blish, presented at the Institute of Contemporary Art,
London, February 19, 1976.

00:43.640 --> 01:06.300
James Blish, an American writer, died here on the 30th of July last year. He
left a large and distinguished body of work behind him. And I'm as convinced as

01:06.300 --> 01:26.480
his fellows or others now as are, that at least some of that work is so loved by
originality imagination by intelligence and by a fastidious sense of style that

01:26.480 --> 01:45.080
is certain to form a permanent part of our literary heritage already before his
best he had won a large and devoted following a hoover of the UK but in the

01:45.080 --> 01:53.480
United States and increasingly throughout the rest of the world as his work
became more and more widely..

01:56.440 --> 02:09.080
I first got to name, and this gives the chance very briefly to introduce myself,
I work in Faber and Fabers and many long years ago, in the early 50s, when I

02:09.080 --> 02:24.320
first joined the firm, I did so harboring a secret vice, which was a passion for
science fiction. It didn't at first affect me that I could persuade Faber and

02:24.320 --> 02:34.680
Faber to embark on science fiction, but I was enborned to show my hand when I
discovered that Jesse Faber, the funder of the firm, and shared my own frequent

02:34.680 --> 02:47.160
passion. And I happened to know that a friend of mine, Bruce Montgomery, who
worked many entertaining and sophisticated textbook stories, and the few name of

02:47.160 --> 03:00.440
Edmund Crispin, he too shared that passion. And with Deputy Glover's
enthusiastic support, I asked Crispin if he would put together for us He

03:00.440 --> 03:11.840
published an anthology of science fiction stories, which he did. and the author
had become, in its own right, a classic anthology by S.F. Which has been

03:11.840 --> 03:23.920
followed up by many successors, running up now to S.F. 6, 7, and eventually 8.
And in that brilliant collection of short stories, it's like a million and most

03:23.920 --> 03:34.660
people have read it, the outstanding moment Jim was a long short story in the
better by taking on the name to me at that time, James Gleish, A Case of

03:34.660 --> 03:45.440
Conscience. So it was through both S.F. and A Case of Conscience that the name
James Gleish first made an impact on my mind and it's quite appropriate that

03:45.440 --> 03:58.520
today we should be remembering Jim Wish, since it's due to Crispin that it
happened, and Crispin, who has been very, very seriously ill, has made a

03:58.520 --> 04:09.040
marvelous recovery, and only this morning, he got married. and I was able to
continue to congratulate everyone this morning, and I know he's busy with us all

04:09.040 --> 04:10.100
here and we're here tonight.

04:38.680 --> 04:52.300
that night suitable cities in flight sequence of novels which is in effect the
greater and higher Star Trek. I personally met him, first of all in New York in

04:52.300 --> 05:03.440
the middle of the late 50s and he made an unforgettable impression that small
moon-like face with enormous glasses through which he slightly gobbled at you

05:03.440 --> 05:13.900
and at first he didn't make very much very much impression, but as you talked to
him and spent an evening with him, you realize that he was a person of

05:13.900 --> 05:24.480
extraordinarily wide originality and range and interest, and I took to him very
much, on a later clip from America I stayed with Jim and his wife, Julie, in an

05:24.480 --> 05:37.600
apartment near Walsington, which was happily interested with the most beautiful
caps and very shortly after that in fact they decided to leave America, come

05:37.600 --> 05:51.820
down and settle here at the Thames valley and I think it's true to say Jim
settled down most happily here and felt in the way he had last found his

05:51.820 --> 06:03.080
spiritual home. Well of course, once they loved him, and I saw a lot more of
them and I realized more and more and more how very wide, and a bit of a

06:03.080 --> 06:17.140
curious, was the range of Jim Lynch's interest and abilities and attainment.
Eurt a part from Science Fiction, he was a musical scholar, he was a great

06:17.140 --> 06:28.120
connoisseur of Pierre and I'm quite certain, that way he's still alive. He'd be
ardent campaigner for the campaign for real Aereo. He was, in fact, his first

06:28.120 --> 06:38.300
-rate James Joyce Scholar, and um, unfortunately, his premature address cut
short. He had a growing reputation in that field. He regularly attended toward

06:38.300 --> 06:47.940
the end of his life at James Joyce Conferences and Congresses, and was taken
with the utmost respect by the great James Joyce scholars of today, like Richard

06:47.940 --> 06:58.720
Ellman and Plythe Hart, and was making contributions towards strange and
important fields of literacy scholarship, he was educated as a scientist and he

06:58.720 --> 07:09.660
knew about physics, of course about metaphysics as well he was learned in the
works not only of Tolkien, but also of what I might call near fantasy

07:09.660 --> 07:23.860
literature, he was fascinated by black magic and witchcraft and white magic,
though I hasten to add he didn't believe in any of it and indeed his premature

07:23.860 --> 07:35.780
death, was short of it would have been a superb book. In that case, a non
-fiction history of witchcraft and black magic, here I owe my own faint, tiny

07:35.780 --> 07:49.860
shadow of footnote immortality, I got myself to Jim, because in Black Easter I
made an appearance, I was tempted to say as a rather powerful, wise, white

07:49.860 --> 08:04.340
musician, Padua Monteith. The last time, when Jim and Judah were living in the
Thames Valley near Hopston, I realized that Jim, who had previously suffered

08:04.340 --> 08:17.960
from cancer and guaranteed for a successful ...was, again, I'm afraid...
...clearly... ...moving into the closing years of his life. I mean, hardly say

08:17.960 --> 08:27.220
he bore his last... ...illness, with the most immense... ...kindness and
fortitude... ...and it was a rare of always, a rare pleasure... ...just to go

08:27.220 --> 08:36.040
and be with and enjoy his talk and his company. He was buried, and I can't
imagine a more suitable place... ...he was buried into Cross Churchyard... ...in

08:36.040 --> 08:52.580
Oxford... um in the very part of Oxford itself, and not very far from the prison
where his Great Hero Roger Bacon had been incarcerated for a number of years. It

08:52.580 --> 09:03.620
was an all together fitting and suitable resting clothes for him, where he lies
today. and as he was buried I thought to myself that his range of interest and

09:03.620 --> 09:20.140
his knowledge and wisdom in the amount of instruction and capacity me people
entitled him too so the title of dr. real others like we have a number of very

09:20.140 --> 09:35.880
distinguished people from the world of fantasy not in that world and well come
yeah to victory to the end with winds like and work My first role I'm going to

09:35.880 --> 09:49.080
ask Peter because of the science fiction foundation and and listen to join me on
the platform. I believe mickles will present a little tell us what he remembers

09:49.080 --> 10:00.700
about Jim personally and after that are you introduce and say something about
what was to jam the most important novel of the whole lot of all novels you have

10:00.700 --> 10:11.680
a wreck. That's his novel about Roger Bate and Dr. Monopolis. Jim Gabb more than
six months ago, which is long enough that stays to me for the period of mourning

10:11.680 --> 10:20.620
to be over. And by the way I understand it, it were here tonight, some of his
friends and very many of his readers talk about his achievements and the sort of

10:20.620 --> 10:30.780
man he was, But not an only story at all of your greater nostalgia, because his
books after all are still very much alive. Not many of the people here tonight

10:30.780 --> 10:39.940
but had known Jim for very long, which is an exception in fact because he didn't
come to living in England with his work duty until 1968 and by that time of

10:39.940 --> 10:49.800
course, he was well and well established in the science fiction world and had
been publishing stories close on 40 years. His first was in 1940 when he was

10:49.800 --> 10:57.520
only 19. You can get something in the flow of the findings of Jim's early
stories in science fiction including the period when he worked as a reader in

10:57.520 --> 11:06.720
Scott Molder's literary agency in New York by reading Damon Knight's chapter in
the book Hale's Cartographers. In that chapter, Damon Knight spends a lot of

11:06.720 --> 11:16.040
time talking about the young SF fans and writers who lived in New York in the
40s and founded a group called the Futurians. It included Damon Knight himself,

11:16.240 --> 11:26.160
Don Rohan, Robert Lowens, Fred Poe, Gino Moran, and Sue Cornbrook. The way
Knight tells it, they were rather shabby years, a group of rather only grated

11:26.160 --> 11:36.040
and shy young people, gauche mainly and in several cases prone to disastrous
first marriages and all this incidentally emerges between the lands rather than

11:36.040 --> 11:46.220
in them of Matt's article now from south seems to endure the period I don't
think Jim did and from the point of view of his development as a writer the

11:46.220 --> 11:54.300
thirties were a slow time for him though he had other achievements to his credit
he meant to fly a light plane which was a fact of the scheme of being widely

11:54.300 --> 12:02.980
published at the bottom. He got a science degree at Rutgers. He did very little
work as a practising scientist and he dropped his post-graduate research to

12:02.980 --> 12:13.060
Columbia and to become a writer. His own stories for the first 10 years or so
were not very distinguished. Jim was obviously a slow and careful learner of his

12:13.060 --> 12:23.480
craft, advancing it by imperceptible degrees but with only resistable momentum
of a juggernaut, a very long to come together after for him in the 50s, helped,

12:23.700 --> 12:35.560
as he always admitted, with John W. Campbell's sympathetic assistance. Now, if
you look at the chronology it's interesting, Vioukky short stories, later to be

12:35.560 --> 12:47.140
collected as a novel, Earthman Come Home, began to appear in 1950. The story
Beostock, later part of the novel Titan's Daughter, appeared in 1952, as did

12:47.140 --> 12:55.680
Surface Tension, later a part of the Pseudo novel The Siedling Stars. which is
really more of a collection of short stories and also the model jack of eagles

12:55.680 --> 13:08.200
in that year a case of conscience originally appeared in 1953 as did the story
common time the short story of bink very good one later to become part of jim's

13:08.200 --> 13:17.720
most recently published model the quincunx of time appeared in 1954. a very fine
short story a work of art which features is a future incarnation of his

13:17.720 --> 13:29.360
favourite composer, Richard Strauss, appeared in 1956. What comes out here, for
anyone familiar with Jim's work, is what a musical in which years. Those years

13:29.360 --> 13:38.980
from 1950 to 1955 were. More especially as Jim was not a full-time martyr then.
Indeed, he told me he used to write in the train, commuting backwards and

13:38.980 --> 13:48.600
forwards to his job in New York. That's how Case of Conscience got written. You
can't help noticing, too, how lifeless hero Roger Bacon, Jim was. He never let a

13:48.600 --> 13:58.260
piece of good prose go to waste. Again and again, the better stories re-emerge
some years later, carefully and thoughtfully integrated into a larger work, and

13:58.260 --> 14:10.620
often slightly rewritten in the process. I met Jim in 1971, by which time his
literary career was by no means over, though it had been badly slowed down by

14:10.620 --> 14:20.980
ill health, worry and it has to be said a very severe writer's block. He never
quite recovered from the cancer that first afflicted him in the middle 60s and

14:20.980 --> 14:28.560
of course his fear was all founded although it was a mother and quite different
form of cancer that killed him. But in the 70s we did see The Day After

14:28.560 --> 14:38.420
Judgment, Midsummer Century and I think we ought to mention those bisquely
written Star Trek books which Jim always referred to disparagingly as his bread

14:38.420 --> 14:46.800
and butter but which were very often written with a great deal of dash and skill
and gave a lot of people a lot of pleasure He was certainly indirectly

14:46.800 --> 14:56.320
responsible for getting me my present job I saw an advertisement in the Times
which read Wanted, Administrator for Science Fiction Foundation I was convinced

14:56.320 --> 15:06.500
that it had to be a joke or some sort of ghastly hole-in-corner operation run by
a bunch of eccentrics Nonetheless I did inquire And when I learned that James

15:06.500 --> 15:16.220
Bish was one of the prominent founders of the organisation, I instantly and
enthusiastically applied. Because Jim, along with Alfred Buster, Fred Pohl and

15:16.220 --> 15:26.420
Cyril Culbreth, was one of the four writers who had most kindled my enthusiasm
for SF when I began to read it in the early 50s. And I've had no cause ever

15:26.420 --> 15:36.740
since to change my mind. I still believe that those four men did more than any
others to improve the standard of magazine SF and to widen its range at a period

15:36.740 --> 15:47.900
of time when that kind of reform was badly needed. I met him soon after I got
the job and we became good friends. He was rather a shy man who, because of his

15:47.900 --> 15:57.880
illness, looked a little older than he was. Indeed, he looked rather frail. But
after a while, as Charles intimated, you find yourself conscious of his

15:57.880 --> 16:05.560
expression rather than his physical appearance. He had very sharp eyes which
always looked very directly at you when he talked and he had a grin which

16:05.560 --> 16:16.360
appeared and disappeared with startling suddenness. He was a serious man but far
from solemn. He had a strong mischievous streak which could emerge in some moods

16:16.360 --> 16:28.060
as cutting irony and even as a kind of wild capering like some wise fool, a
gesture out of Shakespeare. I always remember him singing in a cracked voice a

16:28.060 --> 16:38.120
strass aria wasn't supposed to be sung by Platon Nostra he sang it first as it
normally was sung and then as he thought it should be sung and the second

16:38.120 --> 16:47.620
version was very much better it was an extraordinary performance a few years ago
he played the Wizard of Oz at a convention fancy dress competition and he was

16:47.620 --> 16:57.900
splendidly if unexpectedly right to the poet he drank a fair amount But in the
several drinking sessions I had with him, he was always very much soberer than

16:57.900 --> 17:08.500
me at the end. In fact, his capacity was legendary. Even Harry Harrison had to
admit defeat on one occasion. And that was only the day before Jim had to go

17:08.500 --> 17:17.020
into hospital to have part of the lung removed. He was amazing. He smoked
heavily, too. I report these things not in order to make Jim out to be some kind

17:17.020 --> 17:26.640
of wild rake, which he certainly was not. In fact he was very much a gentleman
in the old fashioned and best sense of that word. I really want to stress the

17:26.640 --> 17:37.140
paradox that Jim, behind what was often quite literally a smoke screen, was a
very sober man indeed. His passions were intellectual. At a party he wasn't

17:37.140 --> 17:45.800
enjoying he could look polite but bored for hours, or silently drift away like
one of the cats that he so much loved. But when the talk got good you couldn't

17:45.800 --> 17:54.060
get Jim to go to bed. He'd talk until the sun rose again in the morning, and
often did, unless forced, as usual, to give up by the lesser stamina of others.

17:54.780 --> 18:04.420
He'd talk about general relativity, James Joyce, politics, medieval
scholasticism, science fiction, poetry, music, cabbages or kings. In fact, Jim

18:04.420 --> 18:13.760
was a wholly traditional scholar who seldom had the opportunity to practise his
scholarship except in his fiction, where sometimes he used it downright wickedly

18:13.760 --> 18:24.060
and inappropriately as in the Star Trek novel Spock Must Die where the secret
intergalactic communications code is based with insane irrelevance on the Jo

18:24.060 --> 18:33.400
Sacan language of Finnegan's Wake. I'm not going to talk about Jim's science
fiction. I'll leave that to Mark Adler who's coming on later beyond saying that

18:33.400 --> 18:42.580
he was an important pioneer. He was one of the very few men of his generation
who continuously and consciously endeavoured with a great deal of success to

18:42.580 --> 18:52.980
raise the intellectual standards of SF, to sharpen its scientific accuracy and
to increase especially the range and depth of its metaphysical speculation. I

18:52.980 --> 19:01.740
want to finish by saying a few words about the book of Jim's of our most value,
Dr. Mirabilis, which he began to write in the late 50s while he was becoming

19:01.740 --> 19:11.940
increasingly a sick man, which was finally published after many difficulties in
1965. My friendship with Jim dates precisely from the time of our first meeting,

19:12.160 --> 19:22.140
when I told him that Dr. Mirabilis was my favourite of all his novels, and he
was quite delighted. I know now what I didn't know then, because of all his

19:22.140 --> 19:31.420
books it was the one to which he had the most passionate commitment, and yet it
has never been very popular. he used to complain in fact about the popularity of

19:31.420 --> 19:42.200
his much-amphlogized short stories surface tension he couldn't see why it was so
successful when for example Dr. Morib으니까 was left i know why it's very obvious

19:42.200 --> 19:51.420
but just the same I think that Dr. Moribnos is the closest thing to a great
novel that Jim wrote i actually think it is a great novel it's not a word you

19:51.420 --> 19:59.640
use readily but despite its flaws some of which are obvious it's a great novel
and I think But very slowly, it will come to be seen as a classic historical

19:59.640 --> 20:10.140
novel. If you don't know it, it's a fictional biography of the 13th century
theomagian and scientist, Roger Bacon. As Jim says in the introduction, there's

20:10.140 --> 20:20.180
so little known about the facts of Bacon's life that this book is in fact a
fiction rather than a biography. But what a fiction. The reason why it will

20:20.180 --> 20:29.620
never become very popular is that it's very difficult, and the reason where it's
difficult is also the reason why it's great. The book undertakes a conceptual

20:29.620 --> 20:41.540
leap unlike anything else I've ever come across in historical fiction. Let me
explain. In the most popular kind of historical fiction, you get an adventure

20:41.540 --> 20:51.480
story staged in an imaginary past, with some colourful stage settings, some
exotic clothes, and perhaps some sword the psychology however is contemporary

20:51.480 --> 21:01.460
the characters behave in a ways familiar to modern readers acting on those with
which the modern leader can easily identify and this by the way is usually also

21:01.460 --> 21:12.440
true of science fiction a much better kind of historical novel such as those
written by ArthurDAvan he by the way was along with Brian Aldous one of the two

21:12.440 --> 21:22.180
readers I believe who advised sebors to bear dr mirabolus in the first place
Duggan always strove to accuracy not only at hysterical event and clothes and

21:22.180 --> 21:31.960
speech but also for accuracy of psychology and feeling Duggan for example
understood very well that it was useless trying to use later concepts of

21:31.960 --> 21:43.540
romantic love in dealing with say the sexual life of an Anglo-Saxon king English
went one step further in dr mirabolus he goes deeper than questions of dress or

21:43.540 --> 21:54.840
setting, or even psychological and physical motivation. He tries to move the
reader into understanding how, 700 years ago, the finest minds of the age

21:54.840 --> 22:05.220
envisaged the nature of the universe. He takes us, that is, directly into
questions of philosophy and metaphysics, and those aren't irrelevant, hard-brow

22:05.220 --> 22:14.880
questions, as he shows. The teachers of the church at that time and the nature
of God and his creation had a quite direct effect on what could or could not

22:14.880 --> 22:25.300
happen in everyday life. There was a certain kind of thinking, for example,
which saw what we now think of as being experimental science as unnecessary or

22:25.300 --> 22:36.720
even evil, hence the slowness of advances in medicine, for instance. Documne
Mirabilis is, in effect, a novel about the creation of science. The word

22:36.720 --> 22:47.180
science, or scientia, existed then, but it meant something quite different.
Bacon, along with Peter Peregrine and some other figures, such as Don Scatus and

22:47.180 --> 22:56.440
William of Aukum, who don't come into Bish's book because they were both grown
when Roger Bacon was quite an old man. These figures didn't invent experimental

22:56.440 --> 23:06.840
science per se, because Lush always existed in some form or another, sometimes
called craft, sometimes magic and sometimes alchemy. Now, what these men did,

23:07.160 --> 23:17.260
especially Bacon, was to invent a way of thinking about the universe which gave
an intellectual shape, a method of organisation and a conceptual framework

23:17.260 --> 23:28.620
within which experimental science could become more than a series of randomly
collated facts and findings. And it's very typical of Jim that he chose to write

23:28.620 --> 23:38.880
on a conceptual organiser rather than a experimenter. He deliberately closed
down that aspect of the Bacon myth which stresses his experimental work. indeed

23:38.880 --> 23:47.320
he comes after the larger part of bankers experiments were kept any repetitive
testing where near experiments many other important Aristotle rather than

23:47.320 --> 23:57.780
original work it does however allow that part of the myth which leads to bacon's
invention of gunpowder he allows that to be possibly true well interesting he

23:57.780 --> 24:04.880
did the invention down to a vision which I think will be led to us in a minute
after all gunpowder had been previously known in China and in the Middle East,

24:06.000 --> 24:14.220
rather than calling it a new discovery. Some of you may be familiar with a Third
-Write book called The History of Western Philosophy, written by Bertrand

24:14.220 --> 24:25.600
Russell. Russell comments, Bacon was not, to my mind, so scientific as he
sometimes thought, and the instances the prior existence of gunpowder is an

24:25.600 --> 24:36.060
example of what he means. Blish sees deeper than this. Dr. Moramblus is an
amazing feat of scholarship in thought, from a man with absolutely no formal

24:36.060 --> 24:45.180
training in philosophy, very little training in the history of science, and at
the time he began writing it, no matter. And yet Blish saw the essence of

24:45.180 --> 24:54.280
Bacon's work, which Bertrand Russell could not see. Blish did this in part by
putting himself in command of the obscure and difficult jargon of the medieval

24:54.280 --> 25:04.280
schoolmen, and understanding it. He is on the way it is showing the most amazing
single passage of the book that when Bacon wrote on what was then called the

25:04.280 --> 25:14.780
multiplication of species, he was really talking about the propagation of force.
In this work, Bacon made the conceptual leap forward which carried him up to

25:14.780 --> 25:23.820
like envisaging a space-time continuum in the 13th century, a metrical framework
of the universe, in fact a thinking which brought him a vague things with the

25:23.820 --> 25:33.040
theory of relativity. to many, the whole book is absolutely gripping. I grant
its difficulty, but the difficulty is so much a part of a performance that

25:33.040 --> 25:42.840
nobody could surely regret it, and, in effect, this difficulty stems from the
relation between the word and the thing. It isn't only a question of vocabulary,

25:43.500 --> 25:53.960
it's a question of the world picture which underlies that vocabulary. Bliss
seduces us into the many of the mind. Most notably, though, when he gives us in

25:53.960 --> 26:00.460
full detail the iron examination in which Roger Bacon wins his secular Master of
Arts at the University of Paris.

26:03.460 --> 26:13.680
I'll skip a bit here and running over. The only comparison I can think of for
Jim's book is Women Golden with the Inheritors, which is also a novel about

26:13.680 --> 26:23.940
conceptual breakthrough and also a difficult novel, as such novels must always
be, because the attempt is to create a truly alien mode of thought in modern

26:23.940 --> 26:34.400
language. A language which is ensuphalted by the way that we think. The
Inheritors by Golding tells of Neolithic men beginning to conceptualize their

26:34.400 --> 26:45.360
universe. In a sense Dr. Mirabilus does the same. All and all alarmingly, in
that its period is so relative and close to our own. There is a popular and

26:45.360 --> 26:52.400
sentimental view that humanity doesn't really change much and that they're all
subject to the same kinds of feelings, the same ways of thinking and have been

26:52.400 --> 27:02.420
for thousands of years. Partly true, but not wholly true. Reading Doctor
Mirabilis is an admirable collective for those who take a sentimental view about

27:02.420 --> 27:13.160
the continuity of history. It is, of course, SF as well as being hysterical
fiction. Conceptual breakthrough has always been the basic subject of SF and

27:13.160 --> 27:23.660
it's present as much in Doctor Mirabilis as in the seedling stars, more so in a
way. Certainly if the way we think changes as much in the next 700 years as

27:23.660 --> 27:33.420
Bisch shows them to have changed in the last 700 and according to Alvin Toddler,
the weight of changes itself accelerating, then most science fiction set in the

27:33.420 --> 27:44.960
future is flatuously limited. Simply in creating worlds which are too much like
our own. Finally, Roger Bacon, it must be said, is James Bisch. and therefore

27:44.960 --> 27:54.640
all the more admirable for not being rendered as heroic. He is shown to be a
fumbling, thick-skinned and awkward man in human relations, a slow and

27:54.640 --> 28:05.960
repetitive thinker, a man who doesn't always realise the importance of his own
ideas, a man obsessed by partly useless activity, such as a kind of encyclopedic

28:05.960 --> 28:14.900
farallness with upbringing, such as might be expected from an accountant rather
than a great thinker. Bacon is shown to be very much a man of his time whose

28:14.900 --> 28:23.980
acts of moral courage are occasionally balanced by acts of moral cowardice I
don't mean that Roger Bacon is modelled on the author I do mean that the author

28:23.980 --> 28:32.560
was obviously enormously attracted by the achievements and even the presumptive
personality of Bacon and it is therefore much to his credit that he did not

28:32.560 --> 28:42.660
sentimentalise the man whom you must surely have seen as a kind of medieval
alter ego anyone who knew James must necessarily be especially moved by his

28:42.660 --> 28:51.920
account of Roger because they wereuwir.com who know so many traces of the author
there vigorously distance girl out of trace of self-indulgence I first read the

28:51.920 --> 29:01.580
book long before I met Jim and even when I'm you used to be one of the most
exceptionally levels I've ever read now what it was written Jim made it

29:01.580 --> 29:13.780
retrospectively the first part of the trilogy whose overall title is after such
knowledge. Wilson self-described the theme of the trilogy as is the desire for

29:13.780 --> 29:25.020
secular knowledge, let alone the acquisition and use of it, a misuse of the mind
and perhaps even actively evil? Certainly this theme plays a prominent role in

29:25.020 --> 29:34.380
Dr. Mirabilis and also in Black Easter, The Day After Judgment and Case of
Conscience, the other books in the series. The title After Such Knowledge comes

29:34.380 --> 29:44.100
from QS Eliot's poem Juontium and I read the lines because I sum up Dishon's
theme beautifully and in more amusant in a symbolic way than he does himself

29:44.100 --> 29:58.040
that's from the third stanza of the poem After such knowledge What forgiveness
Think now History has many cunning passages Contrived corridors and issues

29:58.820 --> 30:11.680
Deceives with a whispery ambitions Guides us by vanities. Think now, she gives
when our attention is distracted, and what she gives, gives with such subtle

30:11.680 --> 30:24.900
confusions that the giving permishes the craving, gives too late what's not
believed in, or is still believed in many, only, reconsidered passion, gives too

30:24.900 --> 30:38.860
soon into more cans what thought can be dispensed with till the refusal
propagates a fear. Think, now the fear nor courage saves us. Thus the musings,

30:39.480 --> 30:49.040
stern, sad and ironical of T.S. Eliot's old man. There are thoughts that can
readily be found in much of this also, but my own thing is that he thought the

30:49.040 --> 30:58.880
game was worth the candle. He knew the dangers of the acquisition of knowledge,
the guilt that goes with eating the apple, but he loved it anyway. Roger Bacon

30:58.880 --> 31:08.400
dreams at one point, which will be there too, of modern law, of Armageddon, and
he understands the vision as a possible result of his work. But the sheer

31:08.400 --> 31:17.140
intellectual passion and devotion, even the love with which he throws himself
into laning despite the dangers, shows clearly enough where the emotional

31:17.140 --> 31:26.400
commitment of the author lay, even if in his intellect, he is able to retrace
our steps as quickly as possible, away from knowledge and back to the innocent

31:26.400 --> 31:36.040
joys of the original garden. You may well share in the fall of man, but Bliss at
least was ready to make the best of it, to risk that mac of forgiveness, which,

31:36.100 --> 31:44.440
in his case, of course, is certainly never in God. And just last of all, I want
to say, this has been rather an academic sort of introduction for you, but I'm

31:44.440 --> 31:55.100
going to apologize, because he himself was permanently an academic sort of man,
in the very best sense. He never talked down or wrote down. He assumed always

31:55.100 --> 32:03.060
that the reader or listener would be as intelligent as himself. I appreciated
the compliment as his friend, and I'm sure the reader did too, whether it was

32:03.060 --> 32:11.520
his friends or readers. I shouldn't distinguish between friends and readers. I
thought myself to be his friend before I met him, and I know that many others

32:11.520 --> 32:16.980
felt the same. Now, Andrew Stevenson will read an extract from Dr. Norhaber.

32:20.740 --> 32:30.040
All right. Roger Bacon, still a young man but already making a name for himself,
goes to Paris University in the hope of being allowed to teach Aristoteolian

32:30.040 --> 32:39.960
philosophy there. This, of course, is Paris in the 14th century, a mixture of
filth and fining, reason and bigotry, the home of disease and disputatious

32:39.960 --> 32:49.800
scholars. University is burdened with ages-old philosophies, endlessly re-quoted
and reinterpreted by commentators. In this unlikely place, Bacon discovers a

32:49.800 --> 32:59.920
group of proto-scientists and attends one of their clandestine alchemical
matibes. However, matibes go awry, and most of those present are rendered

32:59.920 --> 33:08.860
unconscious by the fumes from one of the expins. Bacon eventually returns with
him that night, still feeling ill, and begins to re-read his copy of The Secret

33:08.860 --> 33:18.540
of Secrets, a letter to Alexander the Great from his teacher, Aristotle. In it
are descriptions of the means whereby certain ends may be attained, including

33:18.540 --> 33:28.300
personal, political and military power. What we would recognize as formulae.
Aitken reflects on what he has read, and gradually the voice of his inner self

33:28.300 --> 33:39.240
begins to debate with him, which prefaces one of the major crises of his life.
Yet these matters, and the most secret of secrets of this kind, have always

33:39.240 --> 33:47.660
hidden from the rank and file of philosophers, and particularly so after men
began to abuse science, turning to evil what God granted in full measure for the

33:47.660 --> 33:56.820
safety and advantage of man until he should strive that the wonderful and
ineffable utility and splendour of experimental science may appear and the

33:56.820 --> 34:12.120
pathway of a scientia universalis be again opened and that's by thee Stanford!
Roger shouted he swallowed and resumed his perch on the stool what out thou of

34:12.120 --> 34:24.460
he said quietly I denied their answer in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord for a
while there was no answer and Roger noted that in the darkness beyond the candle

34:24.460 --> 34:34.720
flame there were strange and awful patches of color pulsing and elusive moreover
his giddiness was worse was that still a sweet vitriol or was he in truth

34:34.720 --> 34:51.480
working to long as Roman I am the Raven of Elias that is blasphemous and untrue
Achatsky, tell me who thou art. I am the man. What man is this? Tell me thy

34:51.480 --> 35:03.560
signification as I will exercise thee straight. Thou art the man. Speak on. Thou
art the man who shall bring back into the world to see and tell you in a

35:03.560 --> 35:18.840
passage. Thou shalt make a written edifice unto the glory of thy Lord. All
health I shall give thee that he required how as food brought unto Elias in the

35:18.840 --> 35:32.380
desert thy native host shall touch heaven and on its brow be written knowledge
is power these cadences were putting him to sleep almost he failed to see the

35:32.380 --> 35:44.820
trap the self-same trap into which the builders of Babel had fallen nay moral
philosophy is the pinnacle By the ways nothing can touch heaven Thou dost thou

35:44.820 --> 35:55.580
know O Jeudah For by the light of knowledge The Church of God is governed The
commonwealth of the faithful is regulated The conversion of unbelievers is

35:55.580 --> 36:05.180
secured And those who persist in their malice Can be held in check By the
excellence of knowledge So that they may be driven off From the borders of the

36:05.180 --> 36:16.120
Church In a better way than by the shedding of Christian blood And this is the
meaning of that saying. Knowledge is power. All matters requiring the guidance

36:16.120 --> 36:26.680
of knowledge are reduced to these four heads, and no more, the self sang. It is
strange and horrifying to hear discourse on these matters weighty and unusual in

36:26.680 --> 36:39.300
that same remote, bodiless, tuneless whine. So it sang only to amuse itself. The
pages and the secrets of secrets waveled and blurred before him. And he closed

36:39.300 --> 36:54.940
the book. He could think of nothing else to ask. He was suspended in an ecstasy
of disbelief. In that emptiness, the self sang suddenly. Time is. Yes, Roger

36:54.940 --> 37:09.220
said. It is a subject of motion. But I don't. Time was. Sang the self. time was
behind the voices music or just seems to hear an endless mirroring of echoes

37:12.580 --> 37:25.060
fourth they had sternly. So the words came forth but in a little slow. Well,
only know that time is singular and linear and giveth up one age belong to all

37:25.060 --> 37:37.340
ages as a necessary conclusion doubted by no one's skill, this philosophy. Now,
easy to pose to sacred writers, the physical doctors, that they're in agreement

37:37.340 --> 37:40.900
with their view, so try to surround us with me.

37:43.900 --> 37:53.700
The movement hung. Points of a candle flame bobbed up and down like a
fisherman's float mured above ripples. When the sun spoke again, its disparate

37:53.700 --> 38:07.240
soundless voice was as terrible as the strokes of a gong of brass. Time is past.
The candle went out. Whence from the darkness there rose rank upon rank of armed

38:07.240 --> 38:16.060
men with sourcing faces, and the faces of sheep and the faces of demons too
bright in their chained look upon massed under the invisible sun passing in

38:16.060 --> 38:26.120
their thousands as men who marched to the last great engagement. And with them
thousands on horseback and born animals not yet seen in the world and many

38:26.120 --> 38:36.800
bearing strange engines and that their head was Antichrist. Yet in a twinkling
oh, this terrible host shrank so that each man was no bigger than a grain of

38:36.800 --> 38:47.200
millet and then even this emet army was turned out of sight as an image vanishes
when the glass is turned and north left behind for the white caps of some

38:47.200 --> 38:58.560
torrent stretching to the far horizon as if one looked in vain across a straight
upcoming invader things moved like Leviathan beneath the waters but there were

38:58.560 --> 39:06.840
engines and there were men in them and there were dragons in the air like the
dragons of the Ethiopians Yet there were men and men, and there were moles under

39:06.840 --> 39:16.320
the earth, and men rode in them, all in men with terrible countenances. And one
wearing a cow came and stood upon the headlands above the wide waters, and held

39:16.320 --> 39:25.020
up such grasses and mirrors as were necessary to show forth these things. And
the mirrors turned, and there across the wide waters was the self-same army

39:25.020 --> 39:35.920
brought close again. Yet now every man was as great as a giant across that
distance, so as every link of the male could be counted. And the mirrors moved,

39:36.060 --> 39:45.700
and the head of him, a cowl, appeared in the air above the army, greater than
any of they, then burning, as it were, of a blouse, of a furnace, yet was not

39:45.700 --> 39:54.320
there. And many of those giants threw down their engines at war and fled, yet
the host came on. And he made in the air certain compositions, which a man might

39:54.320 --> 40:05.260
know, only by smoking them, or not at all. But on came that inexhaustible host,
and at their head was Antichrist, And he and a cow hurled out his hand over the

40:05.260 --> 40:13.660
wide waters. In the palm of it were certain crystals like saltpeter from the
dunheap. And he wrapped the crystals in a scrap of parchment without any writing

40:13.660 --> 40:18.500
on it. And cast it into the wind, crying. Loupilile, loupe lune!

40:22.660 --> 40:30.760
Where at all that army was seen to fall in a single flash of lightning. And with
a roar of such sharp thunder that the cow flew from the skull of him that had

40:30.760 --> 40:44.580
cried out. and he fell dwindling away to nothing like an ever-baring lamp cast
into the sea. After that for a long time it was darkness and silence. But it is

40:44.580 --> 40:52.560
not the nothingness of sleep, in which the consciousness of time itself is
obliterated. So in an instant the night is gone that wakeful men could fight

40:52.560 --> 41:07.100
for. Time passed, but what events marked it in that fable silence could not be
known. nor words spoken reach the ears nor any touch penetrate then he mourned

41:07.100 --> 41:18.360
and heard and confused light passed before his closed lips and while it was gone
in a new darkness he almost awoke drawing a breath only to discover that he

41:18.360 --> 41:31.300
could hardly breathe and when he was soaked in sweat someone murmured near him
and there was an answer he understood neither now however he could fall into

41:31.300 --> 41:44.520
trotism now while Mark Agrabah and Richard Carter join me here on the platform
will do a short musical interval that reminds us of Jim's very great devotion to

41:44.520 --> 41:54.840
music and his great interest in music which was a very scholarly interest first
of all we play a short extract from a very rarely performed opera by Richard

41:54.840 --> 42:07.380
Strauss which was Jim's favorite opera, and after that there were a record which
was of even greater rarity and of very considerable personal interest

46:24.300 --> 46:24.460
There's a strange in the dark.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.820
Thank you.

46:38.820 --> 46:50.680
In the 1940s, James Blochum and some friends started to get a very small record
company, Van Well Records. And this record, the one I'm going to hear now, is

46:50.680 --> 46:59.360
the very first record we ever made. that's uh to cancel our got a noira by sound

48:31.800 --> 48:51.060
What about you?

49:05.860 --> 49:07.180
Harry Potter was born in the area of the dividends, The explosion happened
again. It was his fault. Now, our Status, There's no power to make it so you are

49:07.180 --> 49:11.980
better than you. But, to

49:11.980 --> 49:15.580
have to understand you, if you could understand you go bigger than you can get.
Here you go.

49:22.100 --> 49:25.780
The grocery store is two out of you. Thank you.

49:39.380 --> 49:50.200
Now, Mark Adnard and Mr. Kuyper have joined me. Mark Adnard has been to talk
principally about Jim Blish as a scientist, and, Richard Kunz Kuyper will read

49:50.200 --> 49:59.540
from one of his best known and most remarkable works, one that I referred to in
my introduction, A Case of Conscience. Well, I would dispute the title at my

49:59.540 --> 50:10.560
talk site, but it's rather more mixed than that. James Blish had many of the
characteristics of writers who appeared in the 40s and in the early 50s and

50:10.560 --> 50:20.320
changed the nature of science fiction. Like many of the best of them, he had
received a scientific education and no science fiction writer had a greater

50:20.320 --> 50:34.700
respect for what Jim called the science in science fiction. He produced his
culture, or more than his culture, of what is sometimes called hard SF ideas. He

50:34.700 --> 50:45.960
was good at inventing credible hardware such as Ice IV which was used in the
building of the bridge on Jupiter in National Health Stars and the sun material

50:45.960 --> 50:56.900
was used for the bones of Sweeney in seeding programme. It was in seeding
programme also that he gave it the word pantripy to indicate an alternative

50:56.900 --> 51:09.460
strategy to what Jack Williamson had called much earlier terraforming. Many of
his SF fictions were derived from what he called the Blackett-Jack equations,

51:09.780 --> 51:20.300
which had been fictionally justified in the building of the Jupiter Bridge and
which led to the construction of the spin-dizzy perhaps the most famous, or one

51:20.300 --> 51:30.880
of the most famous of the fictional interstellar drives and the chief motive
power in what can be known as the Settison Flight series the bracket of Duract

51:30.880 --> 51:41.940
formula comes up again and again it is the basis of the development of ESP in
Jack of the Eagles and the Duract communicator for talking to other interstellar

51:41.940 --> 51:47.420
distances this business is one of numerous spin offs from the original equation.

51:49.940 --> 52:00.100
But there is much more to Jim Blesch than this—in him this respect for the facts
and possibilities of science is part of a broader passion for intellectual

52:00.100 --> 52:13.120
knowledge and sometimes of a search for intimate truth. his preoccupation
appears of going to gain a fiction toward the end of his most popular story

52:13.120 --> 52:27.420
certain tension the dime prices there is nothing but knowledge cannot do a
little to move on will say certainly asante mares that's the price is crying

52:27.420 --> 52:40.400
gentleman the universal going and knowledge and then in Doctor Mirabilis we find
Roger Bacon on his deathbed asking God to forgive him for having perceived power

52:40.400 --> 52:53.860
and intellectual truth instead of only the latter and then in Black Easter the
protagonist has sacrificed everything in pursuit of knowledge this concern with

52:53.860 --> 53:22.160
intellectual truth is closely linked with the problem of moral choice and the
existence of evil question is dramatised in the Jesuit intelligence of

53:22.160 --> 53:33.820
hate people who are offended against the intellectual and the moral code. John
and Alfie said the first freedom is freedom to hate. In a personal letter from

53:33.820 --> 53:45.960
Jim, one of the matters, he described John and Alfie as one of his favourite
characters. The people who were hated often appeared as snakes. In early

53:45.960 --> 53:58.520
technology, in the model Alive of the Stars, the most hated figure is Frank The
manager of the most evil of the tramp cities. It is said of him that he has no

53:58.520 --> 54:09.100
more feeling than a snake. And then in the later tetralogy, in the novel A Case
of Conscience, it seems that the product of the fertilized egg may return to the

54:09.100 --> 54:22.840
sinless planet of Lycia, and the game played a role of the first of all snakes.
I sat up there late with Jim on one of those famous mornings, and he described

54:22.840 --> 54:37.340
to me the characteristics of various kinds of snakes, happily without naming any
names. The catalogue of snake-like fowlings seemed to be almost interminable.

54:38.180 --> 54:51.920
And I almost ended Bram Aldous, who was quietly dancing with Peter Nichols in a
nearby corner. I said almost. I put up what I suppose was the traditional

54:51.920 --> 55:02.000
Christian feel that one should hate the sinner, not the sinner. And I tried to
support my arguments by a rather brightly remembered quotation from Othola.

55:03.600 --> 55:13.940
James, he thought I could support my cast better if I used a different text and
it promptly delivered a long and flawed quotation in Italian. When he finished I

55:13.940 --> 55:23.480
asked him what it was. The term was from Boruto's libretto Perverde's Othello
and it has been superior to the Shakespearean verses from which it was derived.

55:24.700 --> 55:34.900
I felt somewhat put down, particularly as I knew Jim as primarily The Streisand
German Opera Man. I noticed that there was considerably time after this I

55:34.900 --> 55:45.220
reviewed some of Jim's short stories for the fanzine cypher. I said, as a
tribute to Jim's art, that one couldn't help hating the people who were

55:45.220 --> 55:57.020
responsible for the evil happenings in such stories as Tombtapper. I received a
friendly but firm letter from Jim, drawing my attention that evening some years

55:57.020 --> 56:00.980
before and pointing out that I had changed sides since our last discussion.

56:03.860 --> 56:14.860
Things like this made Jim a very formidable friend. It was alarming when he
indicated, in a few casual words, that he was a total master of a complete field

56:14.860 --> 56:23.780
of knowledge which one had had ever too been scissorsly aware of. It was even
more alarming when he indicating in a few more words that he considered this

56:23.780 --> 56:32.040
obscure field of knowledge to be helpful and relevant to whatever it was you
were trying to talk to him about. I remember the first British Milford

56:32.040 --> 56:43.240
conference. Jim came in with a well-worn, overstuffed TASHI case. I imagined
that it was crowned with our manuscripts and Jim's affluent-like notes upon

56:43.240 --> 56:53.080
them. He sat there with the throat surgical scar on his neck with Jim and Tiong
held in the hand with trembling so much you could hear the eyes clipping against

56:53.080 --> 57:02.900
the glass. and it was so that on the other hand, on which he drew continuously
by the section of his cheeks, and that there were slightly of upper eyes that

57:02.900 --> 57:12.320
were so terribly intent, and so terribly sincere, and so terribly honest. I
remember thinking that if a special part of heaven was set aside for science

57:12.320 --> 57:22.540
fiction people, then Jim would have a seat at the very top. We deserved it I
decided, because he put the fear of God into more science fiction much larger

57:22.540 --> 57:23.980
than any man you ever did.

57:27.400 --> 57:30.980
Jim don't shoot an attack on what is called I think Tuckerism.

57:40.160 --> 57:48.420
...Steger and he's telling me Long, who is a mythian, hands over the gift that
he's promised to give to the priest.

57:52.320 --> 58:02.900
It was only a short journey to the clearing, where the mighty spindle of the
ship stood ready to weave its way back through the geodesics of deep space to

58:02.900 --> 58:14.720
the sun which shone on Peru. There's only some sunlight here, piercing now and
then through low scudding clouds, but it had been rain though morning and would

58:14.720 --> 58:26.100
begin again soon enough. The baggage went on board smoothly and without any
fuss. So did the specimens, the pims, the tapes, the special reports, the

58:26.100 --> 58:36.440
recordings, the sample cases, the slide boxes, the barbarians, the type coaches,
the pressed plants, the animal cages, the tubes of soil, the chunks of oil, the

58:36.440 --> 58:49.540
lithium manuscripts in their atmospheres of helium. Everything was lifted
dreariously by the cranes and swung inside. Agronsky went up the cleats the well

58:49.540 --> 58:59.380
up first, with Michaelis following him, a barracks bag slung over one shoulder.
On the ground, Cleaver was stirring some last minute bit of gear, something that

58:59.380 --> 59:11.900
seemed to require delicate, almost reverent plugging down, before the crayons
could be allowed to take it in their indifferent grip. Cleaver was psychically

59:11.900 --> 59:25.000
motherly about his electronic apparatchiks. "'Ruth Sanchez took advantage of the
delay "'to look around once more "'at the more margins of the forest. "'At once

59:25.000 --> 59:35.920
he saw Steka. "'The Luthien was standing at the entrance to the path "'the
Earthman himself had taken from the city "'to reach the ship. "'He was carrying

59:35.920 --> 59:48.440
something.' "'Cleaver swore under his breath "'and undid something he had just
done "'to do it in another way. Luce Sánchez raised his hand. Immediately Stéker

59:48.440 --> 01:00:03.100
walked towards the ship in great loping strides which nevertheless seemed almost
leisurely. I wish you a good journey, the Lucian said, wherever you may go. I

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:15.040
wish also that your road may lead back to this world of some future time. I have
brought you the gift that I sought before to give you, if the moment is now

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:25.500
appropriate. Cleaver had straightened up and was now glaring up suspiciously at
the Lithium. Since he did not understand the language, he was unable to find

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:38.700
anything to which he could object. He simply stood there and radiated
unwelcomeness. Thank you, Luise Sanchez said. this creature of satan made him

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:51.760
miserable all over again made him feeling tolerated in the wrong yet how could
she eat her knowing the lithium was holding up in a small vase sealed at the top

01:00:51.760 --> 01:01:04.040
and provided a few gently looping handles The gleaming porcelain which it had
been made still carried inside it under the glaze the fire which had formed it

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:16.600
It was iridescent, alive, with long quidling festoons and prunes of rainbows and
the form of the whole would have made any potter of grease abandon his tread in

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:28.880
shape It was so beautiful that one could imagine no use for it at all Certainly,
one could not make a lamp of it or fill it with leftover bits and put it in the

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:40.860
refrigerator. Besides, it would take up too much space. This is the gift,
speaker said, It is the finest container yet to come out of Köladeş Pikottin,

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:54.100
the material of which it is made includes traces of every element to be found in
lithium, even including iron. and thus, as you see, it shows the colours of

01:01:54.100 --> 01:02:06.920
every shade of emotion and of thought. On earth, it will tell earthen much of
lithium. You will be unable to analyze it, Ruth Sanchez said. It is too perfect

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:22.700
to destroy, too perfect even to open. Ah, but we wish you to open it, Steter
said, for it contains our other gift. Another gift? Yes, and a more important

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:33.840
one. It is a fertilised living egg of our species. Take it with you. By the time
you reach out, it will have hatched and you'll be ready to blow up with you in

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:50.100
your strange and marvellous world. The container is the gift of all of us. But
the child inside is my gift, for it is my child. Appalled, Ruth Sancher took the

01:02:50.100 --> 01:03:03.420
bronze and trembling hands as though he expected it to explode, as indeed he
did. It shook with some deep flame in his breath. Goodbye, Peter said. He turned

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:15.560
and walked away, back towards the entrance of the park. Cleaver watched him go,
shading his eyes. Now what was all that about, the physicist said. That snake

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:26.080
couldn't have read a bigger thing out of it he'd been handing in his own head on
a platter, and all the time it was only a jet. Meep Banchett did not answer. He

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:36.960
could not have spoken even to himself. He turned away and began to ascend the
cleats, cradling the vase carefully in one elbow. It was not the gift he had

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:50.020
hoped to bring to the holy city for the grand indulgence of all mankind. No, but
it was all he had. Now he was still climbing, a shadow passed rapidly over the

01:03:50.020 --> 01:04:02.940
hole. Cleaver's last crate being worn aloft into the hole by a crane. when he
was in the airlock with a rising wind of the ship's dense generators around him

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:16.540
a long shaft of sunlight was cast ahead of him picking out his shadow on the
deck after a moment a second shadow overlaid and blurred his own cleavage when

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:22.260
the light dimmed and went out the airlock door slammed

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:40.380
that Oh Warren Walker and Josephine Saxton are coming on to the platform now.
One of James Glitcher's most intense and proud of passions was for poetry. Not

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:50.400
only the poetry of other people but his own poetry. Though it's not very widely
known, he did write poetry himself and some of it was published. All of it in

01:04:50.400 --> 01:05:02.420
American magazines, most claims, small magazines, but a few poems in some of the
prestigious academic reviews. job I will talk a little about James V Milky

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:08.400
himself and his own images of them, and then he'll deal with poetry and James
Blish.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:24.780
It is perhaps not as widely recognised among his readership as it should be
that, as well as a masterly writer of prose, he lost, for me last, James Blish,

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:40.140
a poet of considerable range and power with a compact, condensed and highly
personal approach. I was, as Charles has just said, writtenly intending to

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:54.440
preface this short reading with some comments of my own, but I feel it is best
that this little known aspect of James's work speak on its own behalf. I have

01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:07.440
been fortunate in being given by Judy Blish a collection of his poems which she
assures me you're among his own great favourites this is called Oryx and Phoenix

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:22.140
cymbial-throated black-stopping mother of unicorns lifting your helix-scored
sobers from the waterless wady, poised, bleeped and shy to haunt the remote

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:36.560
empty quarter, virgin and aden, elusive gentle as legend and antole coz of sweet
and measureless dream we have trapped you now in our industrial desert. And so

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:48.300
did you hear the twos and imprisoned Zodiac minsters breathe poison with good
cursed rocks. The new tombs, tombs of St. Nabe and Sally awaiting an earthquake.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:07:04.080
We, the new Nabateans, stir and fail to believe Our girls, lapless weed of the
fire from heaven, giggle to see you wonder and laugh at your story. You who

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.660
shall shake your beauty forever in the protection.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:23.760
This, called Song of the Eye, includes some of the most famous anagrams in all
of history, those in which Galileo concealed his discoveries concerning the

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:38.920
natures of the planets. Son of the eye. Hei ki nateoram me ean fostre le guenta
o ee. Will you then forgive me? But she a girl, those catch as I am, and street

last 11th companion of Ganymede sneaking the sick from the chalice.

I understood that was of the stall of its geodesic not plunging to fall except
in phrase where he'll be much removed is. Nor am I much afraid. In your whole

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:20.780
mark of the earth is the great of matters, is my stars removing a heart. I am
stained as old as sirens, as green as Comet's hair caught from the Jovian

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:35.340
shoulder, parametric to his customary need. The pacer does not change. He is
quick but turned quicker and the cusps of the darker squire. Forgive me. I shake

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:39.460
my name and hope. They are changing the world.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.760
Said Alice.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:09:03.240
And this is called Thorley of Right Action. The fine and twisted consciousness
is known as the Mason's square and bears its journey arm to be taken through

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:14.500
each sentence with a lifted lid the drawing where she is the thing done the
indefeasible stone join that the carpenter whose shop is stormed by total loss

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:28.960

the stone also the oil the features proved that it was in the crowd it shied its

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:42.500

freighted and where will it fear in lungs just emptied of insipidance song and

01:09:42.500 --> 01:10:00.360
this is called followed as also first line. Tabby, dead, silver sock, his
thirsty sickness punished. With such cheer he watched the dripping tar tick him

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:14.200
away as though an actor wept. It was unknew but dead not tragic in the tear but
in the eye. Stalk inside troopers afloat and silver I tarnished in the homes

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:28.880
that once had loved. And death, the open world, with planets to destroy laughter
and roops so generates of gaze, and miserly of water. Under be-first bridge,

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:36.260
father of gods, junior of swords, cure of a silver trail, content to yield up
his small joy.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:51.500
As a particular favour I have asked the chairman to make me to add to these
poems by Jim something which I did not know until he was no longer with us, he

01:10:51.500 --> 01:11:07.320
very dearly loved and it says so much of what I would like to say but I feel it
better simply to read you The Moment of the Maker by William Dunbar is that till

retrous magicians and theologists, then healteth no concursions, slay.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:09.020
In medicine most practitioners, leeches, surgeons, and physicians, the self for
dead may not supply. To not mock this contour about me. I see that mockers,

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:25.140

01:13:51.240 --> 01:14:06.380
I our ancestors preferred putrefaction over evolution. They were inbound,
wrapped in sheets of lead to a store in coffins and a vault. When my time comes,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:20.820
I want to grow into a stork, a leaf, a flower, and an ear of corn. Thank you,
James Lynch. Josephine Sacks, to me, is, another thing, he's going to give us a

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:29.380
glimpse of some of the works which James Blish left behind along his breath, and
which are, as yet, unpublished.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:48.800
A few months before his death about ten months, shall I remember, James Blish
asked me to collaborate on a novel with him. It was a science-fiction novel. And

01:14:48.800 --> 01:15:02.660
he'd been nursing the idea for about a year. after consideration about minutes
and consensus. James was not only a writer he was an excellent teacher and

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:12.700
critic and I thought well enough of his mind to watch show notes. He thought
well enough of my work to believe that we could make a great success of the

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:27.700
project. With enthusiasm our work began. This evening I'm about to reach a short
piece which he wrote, and gave to me, to ask what I thought of it, which is part

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:41.660
of the message. I've chosen it because it's a typical piece of his, unelted by
myself. Those who knew this idea would be surprised, or so he thought. A great

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:49.480
joke which we shared with me was a certainty that our real writer would never
guess which bits had been written by which author.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:16:05.920
actually, this is a little incrustworthy. I was this evening to look for James
Joyce. I had read other things to James Blish on occasion and he said that he

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:18.120
loved to listen to my voice because of, I presume, what imagined it's be, its
Welsh accent. I practiced reading the famous Annalybia passage in a Welsh accent

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:32.320
and somehow it left all sense and meaning. So that is why I shall offer you this
little reading of a work which I'm left to complete by myself, perhaps, from the

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:44.540
plots, plans, outlines, discussions and ideas which so excited our imagination
in the bleak instant before I fully realised that I would be left, if you'll

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.540
forgive the bit of jargon, literally, on my own trip.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:17:01.340
There's a quote at the beginning of this particular little chapter. The great
spirit that knows the world is dead long ago. He could not possibly have lived

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:12.640
as long as this. It's a quote from the North American Indian, that phrase it is,
of course. She only did not know what she had expected an interplanetary vessel

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:23.500
to be like, but she was no less certain that by the simplicity of this one. Two
kids and nearly transparency had dropped concerning two airboats side by side.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:35.300
No power source was visible, no other any instruments, even the entrance
preoccupiedous round without guidance. When a glimpse was closed behind her, the

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:44.400
airbags, too, became almost impossible to see in the light from the bare cabin
outside. There was a faint difference in their index of reflection, and that was

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:54.480
all. The pilot set her light on one, and as she did, Uncle Hur was strapped to
the deck by rudess stripes and anchors. He lay down beside her on the other, but

01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:06.440
he clicked her to himself. How does the car work, she asked him. He looked
surprised. Astral projection, he said. What else? She could think of an

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:17.800
alternative. But I thought that himself leaving the body behind such would be
impractical. He fell silent, and the pilot was doing nothing not over.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:27.900
Fortunately, she already knew why interplanetary travel, as opposed to
Indistrilla, had survived the talk. It was because of the notion uncertain,

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:37.380
which represents another machicrate which desired the most extreme physical
separation from all other entities. The titanium was not even exchanged

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:45.920
knowledge by radios, but in exchange for a few supplies they could not
manufacture on their giant moon would tolerate very occasional personal contact.

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:58.120
Then philosophy, which was called stochasticism, held that all events happen at
random, And it is of only nature when we talk about that need to be undesirable.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:11.320
Therefore, they chose to pay the money of events in their lives to a minimum and
to legitimately structure the fields they have to allow. It was for believing in

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:20.620
their touch with them that the limited research into theEM system had evolved,
almost casually, by curiosity out of opportunity. How long will the journey

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:31.160
take, she said eventually? The question is unreal. The pilot closed the side and
promptly fell into the deep relaxation room, Learned a profound view, but with

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:41.740
great slowness. After a few moments, a soft violet light grew around his crown.
At first, she wasn't sure of this, but at the same time, Right in the same color

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:52.180
and smooth, the blood of the man got bleeding and both impartially. However, his
aura was both more intense and more localised than his elimination. It landed

01:19:52.180 --> 01:20:03.800
gradually into a band of white around his eyes and then the lower part of his
head began to go blue. Now a royal wooden cloak, seething into yellow around his

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:12.740
chest with his arms and into our own jogger's abdomen in layers and hands. His
legs began to radiate profound redness and at to speak to Miss Brownett in our

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:25.660
books. Clearly Miss Rogion, had to be coming from the ring for her to arrest
upon him, remaining as they were arriving from the end manifest. She learned

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:34.780
something which was hurt and cure as the other. Only many people could hesitate,
that was well known, though she would never be foreseen anyone do it. That, a

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.860
granny hadn't said, was because they all had the gift, so it was

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:14.640
ostentatious to use it'. For before through his rain-walker course you could no
longer see at all outside the ship, for its investiture was the planer of the

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:24.860
tool. Nor was there any sensation of motion. After a timeless indefinite pain of
the two hours simply feared, and were gone, in reverse order to the way they had

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:33.740
been born, and with them the sensation in children's belly, which she regretted
without knowing why. She had no time to think about it, for over her head, in

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:42.280
her very face, the great rainbow storm that was Jupiter raised down in silence.
Well, it was certainly a more interesting way to travel than being squirted to a

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:52.080
hyperspatial tool. It had been to her, in averted benefit, that the end manifest
could not be persuaded to transmit anything more complex than small, dist

01:21:52.080 --> 01:22:02.600
Beaders of molecules. Crossing all those hundreds of millions of miles that way,
she imagined, could be even duller than allowed in an underground car. The

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:13.060
landscape outside was stony and remarkably like the surface of the earth. Except
that there was no dust, so that light was violently brilliant, the shadows were

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:26.120
ink black and there was a sharp horizon. She understood that that was because
there is no air. Why then were the rocks in here of any bit as well? What

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.920
existed here to award them?

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:40.580
We hope the evening wouldn't be complete without a brief reminder of two great
interests of James Zish, which have both been referred to before this evening.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:54.900
The first of those is the work of James Joyce. Well, as you've heard, Josephine
Saxon thought she must decline the responsibility of reading James Joyce. Who

01:22:54.900 --> 01:23:05.080
better than James Joyce? So we're going to play a brief extract from that famous
recording of Joy leading the end of Anna-Lydia Clara Bell.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:19.140
Subjew your nudge, you humble creature. What is it for a black body growth? On
your brow grouse in foreign conscious arms? Are you meeting Turpie and Loweens

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:29.000
and Gregory? I mean, I thank all the four of them, and the roar of them. I drove
that stray on the mist, and old Johnny might do be along with him. Is that the

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:40.380
pool bed, flash of the onto? Far, far. What if I have both coasting near the
Krishna? Or, aglow, I behold within a hedge? Or might Gary come back from the

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:53.120
Indus? Wait till the honeymoon the loom, Lord. Die, Eve, little Eve, die, we see
that wonder in your eye. We'll meet again, we'll part once more. The spot I will

01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:04.280
seek is the ire you'll find. My chart shines high where the blue milks upset.
Forgive me quick, I'm gone, goodbye. And you pluck your watch, forget me not.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:16.660
You're even yours, so sweet to Jagma send. My sights are swimming, ticker on me
by the shadows through this place. I slow home slowly now, by your way, my

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:31.640
valley way. Tolly I, too, brought mine. Oh, but she was the queer old Skiosha
anyhow, I'm sure she was the queer old Dunce too. Dear Dirty Dumplin, who's

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:41.380
still father of Curry's and Gaffer gives. Gaffer and Gammer, you're all my
gangsters. Hadn't you seven dents to wife him? And every dance would have seven

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:50.980
crutches, and every crutch, had it seven heels. And each year had a differing
crown, cents for me and sucker for you, and the doctors billed for Joan John.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:25:02.280
Before, before, he married his markets, cheap by sallen off like any Ethrodan
Catholic heathen. In their pinky liminy, creamyises, and their precious Indian

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:14.640
molds that that naked festivals dis frightened. Then all that was was fair,
before even land, teens of times and happy returns the same in youth. Nor both

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:27.440
very far, nor above. Nor both, nor both. Nor both, nor both, nor both. Nor both,
nor both! But how altruced, like each one in person, Latin, me that naturum, if

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:43.120
he scullered. Out of your Sanskrit into arium. Your cooscivis, ad lanensis. We
have buckled paps on him, protleans or orphans. Oh Lord, kings of his bosom,

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:58.580
Lord save us. And horse, oh, that all men, hop, his chittering battle bow.
Rocks, come here with the water bow, the chittering water bow. Glittering bats,

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.640
field nights, bark, pork.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.920
yeah

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.820
I could to me I I

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:42.920
can The old oxfold of sham or sham, all living as dark as sand. Down Fox zero.
My whole head down. I feel as heavy as yonder storm. Tell me of sham, of sham.

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:59.340
See where sham and sham the living sun and dark as are. night night Amy-tiny
tell me turn the oven night night tell me-tiny that stem of spain beside the

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:04.620
river and waterize river and thittering waterize night night

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:19.200
Another great enthusiast of James Blish and a very different one we are moving
northwards from Dublin and Mississippi to Belfast and Lagann In fact, we're

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:27.260
moving to Bob Shaw. One of the своest of our science fiction writers here in
this country. And he's going to talk about beer.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:44.820
I don't know if anybody realizes it, but when Judy was mastermind this evening
we were hopping together, she assigned different tasks to different people. And

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:52.500
she taught me I was to speak about beer. and I'm wondering why I was chosen for
this particular job.

01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:09.800
It may have been because a couple of years ago at a convention I was seen
standing holding a pint of beer. But I'd like to hasten to add that this beer

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.540
didn't belong to me I was mining it for somebody else.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.520
It in fact belonged to Harry Harrison who had just snapped upstairs to ride a
muzzle.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:38.120
Actually, the subject isn't in a favor to Jim, as we all know. When I first met
him I expected him to be a very grimly, very serious type of person in all

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:49.940
levels, and it's Armageddon, cropped up a lot in his work. And I, presuming to
advise such a man actually said to him, Jim, don't worry about Armageddon.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.360
That's not the end of the world.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:06.620
But there, in fact, there isn't an honorable connection between SF writers and
beer, it's fairly honorable. In fact, thinking back now, it's done like

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:07.720
disgraceful, What about the process?

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:26.580
Godway, of course, introduced beer to Mars in his books. Well, beer cans, he
complained a lot about Earthmen stirring the desert with beer cans, and�를 spoil

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:38.520
the legacy of ancient fragile temples. And science fiction in the 50s I seem to
remember, there was actually a project to build pail of beer cans that would

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.760
extend right up to emoji.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:56.880
Talking about Jim he liked beer and he brought bottles of beer along from the
conventions carefully chosen but it says a lot to us crossmopolitan tastes and

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:04.100
he even learned to like English pub beer and this is quite a feat for an
American They sell goods and supplies and shippingmarcomers. This museum was

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:13.260
used, all his life, to the chilling-fishing drink, which was served up in
American bars and given them the name of beer.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:28.560
The golf which exists between that kind of beer and all of us is summed up in a
three-corner conversation Jim and I were having with the newest fan at Coventry.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:40.780
and this chap is a keen member of Kaoma in the campaign for real ale, and he was
describing a beer you've got in a pub which he was recommending, and he started

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:48.520
off describing his panty and he said it was a bit sore, lukewarm, flat as a
pancake. Perfect.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.400
And Jim, you must do agree with him, because he had in fact learn to appreciate
our kind of beer.

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:12.200
He understood too that a dedicated boozer isn't put off a drink just because it
doesn't taste very nice.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:25.880
Sometimes we have to force ourselves and it's... quite often in my life thinks
I'm out enjoying myself and going through hell,

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:42.440
I don't want to run over time on perhaps a trivial aspect of what we're talking
about this evening, but I've got one final beer story about Jim, and it goes

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:56.160
back to the time two years ago when four S.A.F. writers were commissioned by the
Arts Council of Great didn't do a week-long tour of the northeast giving talks

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:13.680
and Marc Adlerd was one who was there and then one or two nights in that week
Marc and I put away quite a lot of beer and other drinks and then we were fairly

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:28.100
enough the organizers of that otherwise very good week had made the ghastly
error of putting it into a champion's hotel. And the lady who ran it was a

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:43.140
rather pure tenical type. And Mark and I arrived home one night about two, one
morning about two. We had forgotten the keys. And I remember it very well that

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:53.720
last walk up to the hotel. Well, we kept munching against each other at every
step, and it was strange, this synchronous bumping into each other, which went

01:32:53.720 --> 01:33:03.600
on the whole way along that street, but we couldn't help it. We got to a hotel
and there was one of these places made up of a was formerly a row of private

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:14.920
houses all joined together and all the entrances seated up tight except the one
which was supposed to use the hotel and the mark and I hadn't had our keys, but

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:25.360
we tried all the other doors and it's been open for years but we did not have
faced this lady who owned the pub or the hotel and finally had to knock the door

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:37.040
and she came out in her nightgown and pulled us off very very severely so that
was the third time that week that it happened that she wasn't gonna put up with

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:52.680
people who drank a lot having like that in her premises um the next day that was
towards the end of the week jimna was arriving and i was talking to the owner of

01:33:52.680 --> 01:34:03.240
the hotel out in the lobby and then and she's decided to go in as part two of
it's helling off, and she's really going on about it. She didn't like losers,

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:13.600
and it's a temperance house, and so. And then just that moment, Jim, came into
the hall, and he was a bit tired. He had travelled up from London, and he was

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:24.780
wearing his black coat, and a black sole-neck jerk, and his fair hat pulled
down, and he looked remarkably ascetic,

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:39.680
and the young lady looked at him and said, is this Mr. Blythe? And I said, yes,
that's Mr. Blythe. And she said, is he a minister? I said, no, but he has

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:51.220
written books which dealt largely as religion. And her eyes lit up and she
dashed across the lobby and said, Mr. Blythe, come with me and I'll get you your

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:57.540
key. And she went the right way and he put his hand again talking and said, can
you get a drink right here anywhere?

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:15.600
He knew there and then that he was one of us. And that's... So I was only one
Instagram character. I appreciate all the others just as much, but they've been

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:32.780
covered very adequately by other speakers, so I'll stand on. Thank you. a more
better way to end and listen to james bish himself in 1959 he won for the first

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:43.220
time with hugo the supreme accolade in the science fiction world and the
following year 1960 is rather to be guest of honor of the science fiction

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:55.340
convention of Pittsburgh cal 1960 and happily a recording was made and next on a
speech and here are a few brief extracts from it
