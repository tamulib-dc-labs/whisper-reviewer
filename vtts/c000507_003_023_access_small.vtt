00:11.300 --> 00:18.460
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.460 --> 00:20.700
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.240
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.980 --> 00:35.380
The subject of this show is an interview with author James P. Hogan.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.080
James P. Hogan is one of the very finest of the Young Science Fiction writers that began

00:42.080 --> 00:47.360
publishing in the 1970s. He has a strong background in electronics and digital systems,

00:47.360 --> 00:52.160
and a broad knowledge of science that is evident in all his work. Some have called him the man who

00:52.160 --> 00:57.560
put science back in science fiction. Hogan's forte is to set a novel in the near future,

00:58.180 --> 01:03.000
to create a bright, scientifically oriented young man as the hero, and then to examine some

01:03.000 --> 01:08.020
theme characteristic of science fiction. He'd inherit the stars and the gentle giants of

01:08.020 --> 01:13.380
Gainamede, for instance. He treats first contact with an alien species. In two faces of tomorrow,

01:13.380 --> 01:17.920
he deals with artificial intelligence. And in Thrice, upon a time, he has written an

01:17.920 --> 01:23.420
astoundingly realistic time travel novel. Hogan's stories are not only exciting narratives,

01:23.900 --> 01:26.920
but also stimulating and thoughtful extrapolations on man's future.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.500
How did you get interested in writing?

02:15.140 --> 02:20.640
And when I left school, I told the world I was going to be a writer. And you could think

02:20.640 --> 02:28.300
it's a good idea until somebody said, well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience of 16

02:28.300 --> 02:32.020
years, what are you going to write about, but the world is breathlessly waiting to hear?

02:33.320 --> 02:39.260
And I hadn't thought about that. And the answer was not a lot. So I went away into engineering

02:39.260 --> 02:45.820
and electronics and computers and things like that for something like 20 years. And I suppose the

02:47.860 --> 02:56.260
interest in writing probably never went away. And 20 odd years later, that situation had changed

02:56.260 --> 03:01.600
a lot. I spent a lot of that time. I started off as an electronics engineer and then a computer

03:01.600 --> 03:12.000
designer and then went into selling computer systems. And not the blue boxes you see at work

03:12.000 --> 03:17.540
that print out payrolls and things. I'm not talking about business computers, but the real-time

03:17.540 --> 03:25.140
scientific systems that might go into scientific research laboratories are connected up to

03:25.140 --> 03:29.520
instruments to collect all the data and turn them into pictures on screens and

03:30.720 --> 03:38.340
sort of computers you'd find in particle accelerator installations or observatories. In

03:38.340 --> 03:45.540
other words, all my customers were scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and so forth.

03:46.320 --> 03:53.120
And the kind of system we're talking about ranged up several million dollars. And when somebody's

03:53.120 --> 03:57.320
buying a system of that size, it's not the kind of thing that you sell in a one-half hour

03:57.320 --> 04:04.380
sales call and say sign the paper. You're frequently working with them for 12 maybe 18 months

04:05.480 --> 04:12.360
before a contract is finalized. And during that time, you have to try and understand a lot of

04:12.360 --> 04:19.540
what they're doing in terms of to be able to put together and recommend the right sort of system

04:19.540 --> 04:24.540
for their needs. In other words, you get to know a little bit of what they're all doing.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.220
And I found it fascinating, a fascinating world that they lived in.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.720
Associating with the scientists, as you were, I guess that gave you a lot of the background

04:34.720 --> 04:40.140
material that you use in your stories. Yeah. Well, that provided more to trigger. I

04:42.900 --> 04:48.120
the stimulation to take an interest in that kind of work. I guess reading provided a lot of it.

04:49.260 --> 04:55.420
But that kind of material is easy to read when you have a vested interest in understanding it,

04:55.480 --> 05:03.000
because you have business relationships that will profit from that understanding. In other words,

05:03.040 --> 05:08.200
it's reading with a purpose, a clear-cut purpose rather than just out of curiosity or

05:10.480 --> 05:17.040
a way of killing time. But luckily, it became a little more than that.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.480
Most of your stories, I guess, would be called hard science fiction.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.760
Do you do a lot of research whenever you do write a story?

05:27.400 --> 05:36.580
Yeah, I do. I read quite a lot. And I suppose the bulk of my reading is nonfiction. So

05:38.300 --> 05:44.960
even casual reading in a way becomes what might be termed non-specific research. In other words,

05:44.960 --> 05:48.760
information that just gets stored away and comes out later, although I didn't

05:49.400 --> 05:51.880
study it for any particular reason at the time.

05:54.180 --> 05:59.680
But while I was, before I became a full-time writer, I was still working in the computer

05:59.680 --> 06:04.520
business. I used to, I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants,

06:05.580 --> 06:10.840
which was kind of handy. I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and other

06:10.840 --> 06:15.520
customers who were studied pieces of rock brought back from the Apollo missions and

06:16.220 --> 06:22.320
other guys who were building in or investigating machine intelligence. And just about any of the

06:22.320 --> 06:27.480
topics or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could take out of a hat,

06:28.760 --> 06:34.120
the chances were sort of not 10 to 1. I had a customer specializing in that field. And I just

06:34.120 --> 06:39.920
had to, if I needed some background information on a particular topic, I could almost guarantee

06:39.920 --> 06:45.440
I had a phone number in my diary as a guy who could talk all day about it. And they loved

06:45.440 --> 06:49.820
doing it as well. I used to call them and they'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow.

06:50.860 --> 06:56.440
Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about? Oh, I need some help with the book I'm working on.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.960
Well, why didn't you say so? What times do you want to show up and they talk all day?

07:00.820 --> 07:02.760
I think this is one of the

07:06.120 --> 07:13.600
interesting sides of selling computers into this kind of area. You can imagine some of these

07:14.520 --> 07:21.460
specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever and they end up shutting the back rooms

07:21.460 --> 07:26.580
of universities. And maybe there are four people on the planet they can talk to who understand

07:26.580 --> 07:35.680
their language. And sometimes they find it hard to believe that somebody from the world outside

07:35.680 --> 07:41.800
that has walked in off the street is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them and

07:42.570 --> 07:48.580
is curious, he wants to know what they're doing, wants to have it explained. And it was a very

07:48.580 --> 07:51.040
pleasant way to work a living. You're not only

07:54.140 --> 07:58.160
gain customers, in many instances I found you gain friends as well.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.280
Your first novel, in fact, I believe it was the first thing that you wrote was In Hair of the

08:05.280 --> 08:15.020
Stars, wasn't it? It's a science fiction detective story. How did you come to write that book?

08:16.580 --> 08:25.540
Well, I think that sums it up pretty well. It reflects I think the way I see science, which is

08:25.540 --> 08:36.480
indeed as a wonderful ongoing never-ending detective story. And I suppose I got a little bit

08:37.700 --> 08:42.620
dissatisfied with some of the depictions of science and scientists that I'd seen in fiction.

08:44.740 --> 08:49.280
I formed the impression or the suspicion in some cases that perhaps

08:52.640 --> 08:58.200
the people who had written some of the fiction certainly would perhaps not work

08:59.060 --> 09:05.320
in a scientific field or spoken to a scientist for a long, long time and maybe generations of

09:05.320 --> 09:11.400
people had reinforced each other's cliches. And scientists were always eccentric and they wore

09:11.400 --> 09:16.880
color shoes and they drew cabbages of eight people and they wanted to conquer the world or something.

09:18.140 --> 09:25.680
And there are these cute public impressions of scientists as people who run down the street

09:25.680 --> 09:33.760
with no clothes on shouting Eureka. You read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on

09:33.760 --> 09:39.720
and what came to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20 years.

09:40.460 --> 09:48.180
And real science, you know, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming

09:49.200 --> 09:55.020
bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes, a lot of people doing nothing really

09:55.020 --> 10:01.440
dramatic or exciting, but just meticulously sifting through details and collecting information

10:01.440 --> 10:07.800
for generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world. And it's really like putting

10:07.800 --> 10:14.180
together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces and twisting them around and

10:14.180 --> 10:18.940
every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner and see that it fits with a

10:18.940 --> 10:25.660
huge chunk down there and that's a breakthrough. And so it goes on. And it really is a detective story.

10:25.940 --> 10:31.240
I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction. And I wanted to write a story

10:31.240 --> 10:37.660
that attempted to depict it in this kind of way and hopefully would convey some of the excitement

10:37.660 --> 10:43.520
that personally I feel when I look at this whole thing. I thought that yeah, let's make it a detective

10:43.520 --> 10:55.400
story, but if we want a detective mystery that is going to be sufficiently intriguing to motivate

10:55.400 --> 11:01.300
a large proportion of the scientific community as happened in Inherit the Stars, we want something

11:01.300 --> 11:06.800
a little more original and exciting than bodies in the library or footprints in the flower bed.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.740
So we invented Charlie and the aliens and the rest I suppose you know.

11:15.000 --> 11:25.380
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is or at least as I perceive it. And at the

11:25.380 --> 11:29.220
time people who were non-scientists, non-specialists would find stimulating and

11:31.660 --> 11:40.680
arousing for the curiosity even if without trying to turn it into a 250 page

11:40.680 --> 11:46.200
lab report or something like that. Yeah, I believe I don't know if I'm reading this into your work

11:46.200 --> 11:52.920
or not, but your writing is sort of almost a celebration of learning, you know, the learning

11:52.920 --> 11:58.560
process. Yes, I think it's one of the most exciting processes anybody can experience.

11:59.900 --> 12:06.760
I think it's very sad that in large sections of our culture we should have evolved the

12:07.480 --> 12:12.260
attitude that learning is something you endure until you leave school and then,

12:12.980 --> 12:18.900
you know, it ceases with adulthood. I think education and living are just

12:21.300 --> 12:24.320
different aspects of the same process that never ends.

12:28.160 --> 12:34.840
In the minds of a lot of people the two seem to have separated out and for some reason

12:36.780 --> 12:40.560
learning is looked upon as hard work and unpleasant and something that you

12:40.560 --> 12:43.960
you steer clear of unless you can't avoid it. I think that's very, very sad.

12:45.520 --> 12:51.280
No reason why it should be so, I think it's just a consequence of cultural expectation. A lot of

12:51.280 --> 12:59.920
people expect it to be hard work and tedious and sure enough it is. In your stories I've noticed

12:59.920 --> 13:05.840
that you really flesh out the futures that you create with a lot of detail. What does that,

13:05.920 --> 13:10.880
that's simply to just make the story more realistic. I was remembering one particular

13:10.880 --> 13:17.340
instance when a hunt is traveling from England to the United States and he opens up his briefcase

13:17.340 --> 13:22.660
and plugs in his video phone to the to the plane and makes this long-distance call right there.

13:23.940 --> 13:35.300
It seems so natural that it just creates a very realistic atmosphere for your story.

13:35.300 --> 13:41.960
Yeah I like to do things like that. I think these kinds of details do matter because

13:43.000 --> 13:50.900
if we are if we're putting a story into a futuristic setting I think the

13:52.680 --> 13:57.940
these little details of background such as if the guy needs to make a phone call how does he go

13:57.940 --> 14:04.820
about it if he needs to render CAD these matter because if the story is being told in the future

14:04.820 --> 14:09.120
the whole back the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.320
I've come across a number of instances which are in my opinion a little flawed because

14:17.320 --> 14:24.900
a writer may have seized on a particular thought maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or

14:25.720 --> 14:31.960
whatever. Develops that very well but kind of gets hung up on it and in the background everything

14:31.960 --> 14:41.380
else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980 and trying to I think just stop typing for the

14:41.380 --> 14:45.240
five minutes it takes just to think about a situation the guy's going to make a phone call

14:45.240 --> 14:52.520
just like stop and think how he might make that and think about it for five minutes and then maybe

14:53.620 --> 15:00.480
show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to do in the first

15:00.480 --> 15:05.760
couple of seconds. It's worth the effort I don't think it radically changes the story but it does

15:05.760 --> 15:12.560
give it that finishing polish as it were at least in that sense and I try to do this in

15:12.560 --> 15:22.200
all the stories and I find the readers like it I think I from the people who who write to me and

15:22.200 --> 15:30.780
the people that I meet one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that

15:30.780 --> 15:38.840
very it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader who buys

15:38.840 --> 15:45.060
anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstores but a lot of I suppose

15:45.060 --> 15:52.560
people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s 30s 40s in all manner of

15:52.560 --> 15:58.140
professions not necessarily to do with the scientists teachers lawyers doctors so forth

15:59.500 --> 16:04.800
who typically would say gee I you know I haven't I used to read science fiction when I was at

16:04.800 --> 16:11.020
college or when I was at university but I kind of grew out of it you know I can't relate to

16:11.020 --> 16:17.220
way out galaxies like years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns today I have a family

16:17.220 --> 16:24.060
of career of mortgage my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet but they seem to like stories

16:24.060 --> 16:29.580
that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now but

16:29.580 --> 16:36.860
maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years and they find names in the book like IBM and Avis and

16:36.860 --> 16:44.200
Boeing familiar places and it kind of grabs them they say well you know this I can relate to it's

16:44.200 --> 16:49.580
the world that I live in just stretched a little bit the connection is not broken the economics and

16:49.580 --> 16:53.680
the politics have evolved from what I read in the papers I can still see the connections

16:54.180 --> 17:00.660
and it could be the world my kids go up it and I like it and if it has that effect on that

17:01.220 --> 17:07.840
you know far off the market of readership then I'm perfectly happy to continue doing that

17:07.840 --> 17:12.920
in addition to the reason that I I enjoy the stories better myself for doing that

17:14.840 --> 17:19.140
I wouldn't be misreading uh in saying you're an optimistic person would I

17:20.040 --> 17:27.500
I think I am and notice your stories uh tend to be rather optimistic sure why not

17:28.460 --> 17:33.080
I think there's enough doom and gloom around I I try and contribute something to counter balance

17:33.080 --> 17:42.400
all that I think it's needed you probably uh would hold a great hope for the human potential then

17:42.400 --> 17:52.920
oh I think it's unlimited it doesn't guarantee we'll uh use it correctly and wisely at all

17:52.920 --> 17:57.440
there's no guarantee of that but I I have no doubt that the potential exists

17:58.020 --> 18:03.720
and the choice is entirely up to us and I think that in itself is grounds for optimism it means

18:03.720 --> 18:10.480
that we're not pawns at the you know that are pushed around by fate or magical mystical forces

18:11.600 --> 18:15.940
that we have no control over our future I think that would be a very depressing thought

18:15.940 --> 18:21.100
uh I think it underlies a lot of the philosophies that we hear astounded

18:22.140 --> 18:29.660
all right you know an excuse to to quit trying to to to uh write everything off as a futile

18:30.340 --> 18:38.200
I don't subscribe to this at all I think that uh in the same way that the individual futilize

18:38.200 --> 18:44.040
in his or her hands and I think they have infinite potential to build upon this give if they have

18:44.040 --> 18:49.100
I think the only resource that we're short of in some quarters is there is positive thinking

18:49.100 --> 18:54.580
and the right attitude of mine uh nothing else and I think collectively the same is true

18:55.840 --> 19:03.720
I think that uh there is a human tendency to be too conscious of our failings and our faults

19:03.720 --> 19:11.720
and our mistakes uh which have happened it would be silly to deny that um but I think by and large

19:11.720 --> 19:17.680
we've achieved some some remarkable and wonderful things as well and can continue to do so and I

19:17.680 --> 19:23.360
think when I look at the bottom line of the balance sheet I'm pretty proud to be a member of the human race

19:25.580 --> 19:31.260
in your novel thrice upon a time you base the story around a device that can send messages back in

19:31.260 --> 19:37.920
time to itself 24 hours in the past and then by that process just keep sending it back to itself

19:37.920 --> 19:43.780
and back to itself uh I've been reading recently about a several scientists who are speculating

19:43.780 --> 19:52.840
about real possibilities of time travel yeah it was your novel uh that your novel really was written

19:52.840 --> 19:57.120
before those came out it's sort of prophetic in a way maybe that's where they got it from

20:00.000 --> 20:05.280
well I don't know whether it's prophetic or not I I said well as it's elaborated in the book

20:05.280 --> 20:11.800
itself uh if something like that ever became a fact there are some pretty interesting problems

20:11.800 --> 20:18.300
they're going to have to be solved and our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have to

20:18.300 --> 20:24.280
undergo some pretty interesting revisions so I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet

20:24.280 --> 20:31.560
saying yes it'll happen um maybe I don't know I think history has shown that uh impossible or it'll

20:31.560 --> 20:37.580
never happen a very dangerous phrase is to use in any context uh as far as I was concerned it was just

20:37.580 --> 20:46.080
uh a fun basis for a story certainly not an original one although I did I was trying I don't

20:46.080 --> 20:50.120
suppose any of the things I've written about have been original in in in essence I try and

20:50.120 --> 20:56.880
approach them from hopefully fresh and different angles but for some time for a number of years in

20:56.880 --> 21:01.420
fact before I wrote thrice upon a time I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number

21:01.420 --> 21:10.180
of reasons uh firstly I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes the logical paradoxes

21:10.180 --> 21:19.200
once and for all and answer them without top outs without convenient coincidences

21:20.100 --> 21:26.100
and without obliging characters who just happen to do the right thing to make everything come out

21:26.100 --> 21:35.620
the way the author said uh and secondly I wanted to I I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche

21:35.620 --> 21:42.140
of some kind of a conjurer's box described or described as whatever that you jump into and

21:42.140 --> 21:48.440
you jump out of and you're in some other time uh we seem too many conjurer's boxes and it seemed

21:48.440 --> 21:54.400
to me unrealistic if if I ever build a box like that and I thought it was going to take me to another

21:54.400 --> 22:00.640
time I certainly would jump into it and press the button I would conduct a long series of tests

22:00.640 --> 22:05.740
and experiments first and none of our heroes ever seem to do this and it seemed to me reasonable

22:05.740 --> 22:10.400
to say if we're going to make the speculation of influencing the past

22:12.780 --> 22:18.040
it seems to me to me to be reasonable to speculate that if we're going to make that assumption anyway

22:18.040 --> 22:26.780
but before we move structured objects and people back into another time it we probably

22:27.400 --> 22:35.040
learn how to inject energy first uh and if you can send energy back in time you can obviously

22:35.040 --> 22:39.940
switch the energy on and off and modulate it and send information in other words you can

22:40.760 --> 22:48.020
send messages to yourself if you like I wanted to I didn't want it to be a million years or a

22:48.020 --> 22:54.080
uh in some huge span of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference how about

22:54.080 --> 22:59.600
a lab bench experiment 10 minutes now you can you can just send a little signal back to yourself

22:59.600 --> 23:04.840
10 minutes ago and change what you've already done this is interesting you know you're hard up against

23:04.840 --> 23:10.460
the paradoxes now you can't um duck around find a way around them or duck them you've got to answer

23:10.460 --> 23:16.900
the question what happened um the logic goes a bit the whole situation becomes absolutely uh

23:17.420 --> 23:22.200
it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out I found the only way to do it was

23:22.200 --> 23:28.960
to think in terms of the simplest possible uh lab bench experiment that you could devise and strip

23:28.960 --> 23:34.480
away all the complications to just get the logic right and then elaborate it back in up to the

23:34.480 --> 23:39.580
level that would make a story interesting and the simplest situation that you can think of is a

23:39.580 --> 23:45.160
button on a lamp and when you push the button the lamp comes on it couldn't get much simpler than that

23:45.940 --> 23:54.320
the only uh different thing here is the lamp comes on 10 seconds before you press the button

23:56.000 --> 24:00.480
because the signal goes back in time so the question is obvious what happened I wait

24:00.480 --> 24:06.360
till the lamp comes on 10 seconds later it's time to press the button I'm not going to press it

24:06.360 --> 24:12.680
nobody could make me I didn't want mystical force is compelling people to do something they didn't

24:12.680 --> 24:20.320
want to do uh wanted to preserve human free will so what happened I don't press the button

24:20.900 --> 24:28.640
conversely I can say well I I the lamp didn't come on but I'm going to press the button anyway just

24:28.640 --> 24:34.860
for hell of it what happened uh so those are two situations one being the inverse of the other and

24:34.860 --> 24:40.400
if you can explain what happens you can answer any time travel paradox because every every one is

24:40.400 --> 24:46.800
an elaboration of one of those situations or the other and it's not good enough to for example to

24:46.800 --> 24:51.380
wait for the lamp to come on and you say not going to press the button and you fold your arms and sit

24:51.380 --> 24:58.080
there and just as the the time is up the door opens and somebody strolls in and says hey what's this

24:58.080 --> 25:03.340
impressive about you know that doesn't get you out of it because you're a scientist you're going to

25:03.340 --> 25:07.260
repeat your experiment under conditions where that couldn't happen you lock the door

25:07.770 --> 25:12.660
and set it up again you go out of the room and have the computer press the button but eventually

25:12.660 --> 25:19.300
you would test it time and time and time again and this uh if accidents happen that that got you out

25:19.300 --> 25:24.320
of a mess for the first time you could eliminate them the next time and eventually you have to face

25:24.320 --> 25:30.300
up to that question what happens that's what I wanted and the first thing I wanted to do was to

25:30.300 --> 25:40.520
tell a story in which the time machine itself and the staggering conceptual changes in physics and

25:40.520 --> 25:47.680
philosophy that are implied are relevant to the story that's being told there an integral part of

25:47.680 --> 25:54.460
it if you talk them away there wouldn't be any story uh I think in too many stories uh time

25:54.460 --> 25:59.440
machines are used like starships they're just a device a vehicle to get some characters into

25:59.440 --> 26:05.660
an unusual environment and then tell a pretty routine story that would stole them from Greek

26:05.660 --> 26:11.720
mythology or european medieval history and the technology doesn't come into the story at all

26:11.720 --> 26:17.220
they could have gone on a greyhound bus uh I didn't want to do that and so the story was about

26:17.740 --> 26:26.100
some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon uh and had realized that if what they

26:26.100 --> 26:30.660
were seeing meant what they thought it meant it meant that they could actually

26:32.080 --> 26:37.340
inject information into the past and change the past with all the questions that implies

26:38.280 --> 26:48.180
uh and being proceeded to test this phenomenon and and it contains some very very strange results

26:48.700 --> 26:53.800
and yet they're convinced that you know behind all this there is some consistent system of

26:53.800 --> 26:58.880
super logic that does make sense and they're trying to figure out the rules of it uh

26:59.840 --> 27:05.880
and uh of course there's an unspoken or unwritten invitation for the reader to participate

27:05.880 --> 27:11.660
again I suppose it's a kind of a detective story uh not so much a who's done it but how is it done

27:12.640 --> 27:15.600
to see if the reader can figure out the rules before the characters do

27:36.720 --> 27:41.040
James Hogan's stories have explored several science fiction themes using extrapolations

27:41.040 --> 27:45.400
of today's technology at times he paints a picture of the future so real you can almost

27:45.400 --> 27:51.060
touch it this type of hands-on hardware science fiction was very popular in the 50s and 60s and

27:51.060 --> 27:56.280
Hogan is helping to bring it back the inherit the star's trilogy is not to be missed by anyone

27:56.280 --> 28:01.960
who is interested in science fiction mysteries are the fascination of new technologies the third

28:01.960 --> 28:05.860
part of the trilogy is entitled giant star and will be released in june

28:13.440 --> 28:20.660
this is david cruise daryl lane and david carcen this has been the science fiction radio show

28:20.660 --> 28:27.140
a presentation of the permean basin science fiction association in conjunction with kocv fm

28:27.140 --> 28:29.740
and odessa college odessa texas
