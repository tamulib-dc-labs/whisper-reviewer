Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.280
And here are your hosts.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.860
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews.

00:47.180 --> 00:51.400
Some of the most exciting science fiction being written today comes from the pen of Jack Chalker.

00:51.580 --> 00:57.180
And it's clear that he's a popular writer, too, probably best known for the five books in the Well World series.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.300
In fact, the first novel in that series, Midnight at the Well of Souls, has sold over a million copies.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.340
Chalker's first book came out not that long ago, 1976, so his work is still fairly recent.

01:08.340 --> 01:21.840
He'd been active in the field, though, years before he started writing, corresponding with authors and other fans, attending conventions, editing a fanzine, even starting a small publishing company, Mirage Press, to produce material on science fiction.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.820
But Chalker says he'd always planned on being a writer.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.300
I'd always known I was going to be a writer.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.740
I mean, there just was never any question in my mind.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.420
But it was just sort of something that you never really sat down and did.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.920
I used to play around with stories here and there.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.880
John Campbell was a big help.

01:41.880 --> 01:49.700
During the 60s, I would float ideas and fragments off him and he would be very, very nice and tell me exactly what was wrong.

01:49.960 --> 02:01.480
Of course, what infuriated everybody about John Campbell was that the man had been editing for 40 years and he could put his finger on something and tell you exactly what you were doing wrong.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.340
And it was terribly infuriating to discover that he was right in almost every case.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.740
You saw why he did it from 39 until he died.

02:12.580 --> 02:24.000
And as a result of being able to have the help of people like Campbell and August Derleth and a lot of really established writers and editors in the field,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.400
I was able to get a good recognition of exactly what was required in the field.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.220
It just was a matter of sitting down and doing it.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.720
And fortunately, he did sit down and do it, publishing Jungle of Stars in 1976.

02:41.500 --> 02:50.220
So I sat at the typewriter and there was really no question in my mind as to what I'd do first.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.860
I had been playing around with an idea for years and years and years.

02:56.660 --> 03:04.280
There's even a short fanzine version of it, 20 years old, called Jungle or Jungle of Stars.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.400
There were a lot of code words, but jungle was always in it.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.320
And I sat down and wrote the thing.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.180
I wrote it.

03:14.800 --> 03:22.480
It had been around so long in my mind and in discussions and so on that there were just no problems, no resistance,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.260
no having to think it out or anything else.

03:26.260 --> 03:29.420
And I wrote it solidly in about two and a half, three weeks.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.880
And then sent it off.

03:34.680 --> 03:38.380
And it's a good old-fashioned type.

03:39.180 --> 03:42.340
It's a science fiction murder mystery.

03:44.100 --> 03:51.960
Very much at home in the old Astounding, Analogs, and so on, even though it does have some modern touches to it.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.800
Some of his earlier contacts with people in the field of science fiction paid off.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.340
One of them, Judy-Lynn Del Rey, bought the novel.

04:05.680 --> 04:16.260
Judy-Lynn Del Rey, who had just become editor of Ballantine, which was soon to have a science fiction line named after her,

04:18.560 --> 04:19.840
took a look at it.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.400
We'd known each other for about 15 years.

04:23.720 --> 04:30.580
And she put off reading it for quite a long time because she was afraid that if it was terrible and she said so,

04:30.700 --> 04:33.220
that, you know, she'd blow our friendship or something.

04:33.920 --> 04:39.960
Finally, she said, we got together at a convention and she admitted to me all this.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.900
She said, okay, I'll read it, but be prepared.

04:42.440 --> 04:46.580
And about four days later, I get a phone call and she said, hey, this is great.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.400
I want to buy it.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.420
And that was the first sale.

04:52.060 --> 04:56.000
Since then, Chalker has published some 13 novels and he's still going strong.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.260
More with Jack Chalker next time.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:08.300 --> 05:11.020
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:11.020 --> 05:14.280
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

06:21.140 --> 06:23.700
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.120
And here are your hosts.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.460
This is David Crews.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.360
And Daryl Lane.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.060
A hike through a national park and a war game board,

06:39.320 --> 06:42.640
unlikely sources for a tremendously popular science fiction novel.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.040
The novel is Midnight at the Well of Souls.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.540
The author is Jack Chalker.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.460
The book concerns the well world,

06:48.740 --> 06:51.640
an artificial planet constructed by a vanished civilization.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.840
The well world is divided into 1,560 separate environments.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.360
Separate worlds, really.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.860
Each with its own climate, geography, and intelligent inhabitants.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.140
Each division is shaped like a hexagon,

07:03.300 --> 07:05.220
and for that reason they're called hexes.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.380
Chalker was in an isolated village called Stehekin,

07:08.580 --> 07:11.060
on the shore of Lake Chelan in central Washington state,

07:11.300 --> 07:12.880
when he got the idea for the well world.

07:14.420 --> 07:18.740
I got to sitting by the lake that night and talking with some people,

07:19.640 --> 07:29.680
and I got the idea for this large world built by a long dead race and so on,

07:29.700 --> 07:32.400
and I didn't really have much of an idea of what it was.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.140
And they do have a service out of Stehekin that'll take you up to Trailhead.

07:39.220 --> 07:42.720
And so I went up to Trailhead, and I wound up walking down.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.060
I'm a great hiker as long as the direction's down.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.340
I'm afraid I've never been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon

07:50.340 --> 07:52.640
because I can get down there, but I can't get back up.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.140
But here was a trail that was tailor-made for me.

07:56.260 --> 07:59.840
It was down the Cascades all the way.

08:01.100 --> 08:08.440
So I took it, and it took about eight and a half hours to walk the whole distance.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.140
And during that time, you go through eight climate zones.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.940
You start off in the snow.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.240
You wind up in a rainforest.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.120
And some of the changes are rather abrupt.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.600
You just go around a switchback,

08:24.160 --> 08:27.300
and it just changes from one climate to another,

08:27.440 --> 08:32.800
each with its own different plants and insects and occasional mammals.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.320
Even the birds seem to be different.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.100
And I thought, yeah, this is how that big world would be like.

08:39.180 --> 08:43.740
So even while I was on my way down, I was kind of scribbling ideas.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.960
And I got the idea for this giant world composed of basically worldlets,

08:52.280 --> 08:57.500
different abrupt geography, climate, landforms, you name it,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.560
each with its own dominant race.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.380
By the time I hit bottom, I had it pretty well worked out,

09:05.400 --> 09:09.340
although I didn't really know what the shape of the things were going to be.

09:10.740 --> 09:11.840
Back home in Maryland,

09:11.840 --> 09:14.000
he got some help on the shape of the well world.

09:15.340 --> 09:19.620
I was discussing the idea with a science fiction fan named Ben Yalow,

09:19.940 --> 09:23.780
the son of the Nobel winner, Rosalind Yalow.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.800
And he says,

09:25.980 --> 09:27.880
why don't you just use an Avalon Hill game board?

09:29.460 --> 09:31.260
And I thought, yeah, that would work.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.180
So we got out an Avalon Hill map,

09:35.360 --> 09:36.700
a war game map,

09:36.740 --> 09:39.020
and a little trusty calculator.

09:39.020 --> 09:45.600
We laid a grid of these hexagons around a roughly Earth-sized world.

09:46.220 --> 09:48.820
Of course, we cannot cover a sphere with hexagons.

09:49.060 --> 09:52.400
So that means we had the north zone and the south zone,

09:52.640 --> 09:55.800
which would be the embassy's entry and exit points.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.360
That would cover our sphere.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.960
And then it was just simply a matter of sitting down,

10:02.080 --> 10:05.120
listing what was required to do,

10:05.400 --> 10:10.360
what kind of creatures and land climate and so on

10:10.360 --> 10:12.640
I would have to do for the route of the story.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.140
Dropping by Avalon Hill,

10:15.320 --> 10:17.100
which I lived very near at the time,

10:17.660 --> 10:19.080
picking up some blank maps,

10:20.180 --> 10:22.000
and just working it out from there.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.840
What Chalker worked out

10:24.840 --> 10:26.400
turned into his best-known novel,

10:26.820 --> 10:27.960
Midnight at the Well of Souls.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.460
It was so popular that it went out of print

10:30.460 --> 10:32.420
a few months after its initial press run.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.740
And Chalker has added four novels since then,

10:35.080 --> 10:36.820
making a five-book series in the well world.

10:37.060 --> 10:40.040
The whole thing turned out to be a colorful and exciting epic

10:40.040 --> 10:41.420
on the origin of the universe

10:41.420 --> 10:42.940
and all of the creatures in it.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.700
It should fascinate any reader of science fiction.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.720
More on Jack Chalker next time.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:58.120 --> 11:00.880
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:01.140 --> 11:04.140
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.340 --> 12:15.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.040
And here are your hosts.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.180
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews.

12:27.460 --> 12:32.020
The five novels in Jack Chalker's Well World series are based on a familiar science fiction concept.

12:32.020 --> 12:38.300
And that concept is the notion of a long-dead race of superior beings whose artifacts are found by humans.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.520
But there are a couple of interesting twists given to this concept by Chalker.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.020
One twist is the principal artifact by the vanished race.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.320
It's a planet called the Well World.

12:48.700 --> 12:54.760
It's artificial, and its interior is a supercomputer that can transform matter into all sorts of living creatures.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.840
It's really a laboratory planet where species are created and tested

12:58.840 --> 13:01.840
before being transferred to various places throughout the universe.

13:02.420 --> 13:07.480
And the other twist is that these superior beings, called the Markovians, aren't actually gone.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.940
They just transform themselves into other, more primitive beings.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.280
Chalker talks about the Markovians.

13:14.020 --> 13:23.340
They got to the point where they were gone, literally, where their devices could conjure up anything they wanted, just with a mere thought of it.

13:25.320 --> 13:31.880
I sense that it pointed out to me that they're sort of like the Krell in the old movie Forbidden Planet,

13:31.880 --> 13:34.840
and that they reached this godhead status.

13:35.460 --> 13:41.220
But the Krell experiment failed because they couldn't control their passions.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.720
And the Markovian experiment succeeded, and they literally became gods.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.440
Then they became miserable.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.940
There was nothing left to attain.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.820
There was nothing left to know.

13:51.820 --> 13:52.760
There was nothing left.

13:52.960 --> 13:59.680
You know, you got a bunch of creatures that spent millions of years rising to this point,

13:59.760 --> 14:01.520
and they sit around and they say, is this all there is?

14:02.900 --> 14:05.960
At this point, the Markovians decided to start all over again.

14:06.840 --> 14:13.180
The idea of the great experiment came about was to redo it,

14:13.600 --> 14:19.780
to literally start the Markovians over from scratch with different kinds of creatures,

14:20.100 --> 14:25.520
different environments, with no real value system.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.080
I mean, they have to develop their own unique value system.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.360
They do.

14:30.220 --> 14:36.780
And as a result, they're grown and they're tested on this laboratory world, the well world.

14:37.120 --> 14:42.060
And then they were the ones that worked, the ones that showed promise of survival,

14:42.060 --> 14:48.320
were then set into motion out throughout the universe, including man.

14:50.940 --> 14:59.640
And they had the hopes that eventually one of these races would reach a state of perfection

15:00.820 --> 15:03.580
that would not be empty or hollow.

15:04.320 --> 15:10.620
Now, I personally believe that when you reach that state, it is empty and hollow.

15:11.400 --> 15:17.140
But that's just my feeling.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.860
Other people might certainly do think differently.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.780
The Markovians create hundreds of different species, all intelligent, but all incredibly different.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.760
We asked Chalker how he gets ideas for creating such a variety of aliens.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.180
I used a variety of things.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.140
In some cases, a good pictorial natural history text

15:38.140 --> 15:40.980
will give you more weird creatures than you've ever seen,

15:42.600 --> 15:44.060
which can be modified.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.360
Some came out of mythology.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.120
Some came more or less direct out of fantasia.

15:53.140 --> 15:54.380
Sources like that.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.620
And a few came out of comic book concepts.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.160
You know, you just draw them in from all over

16:04.160 --> 16:06.360
and you use basic shapes and basic types.

16:06.360 --> 16:12.000
And then you adjust them to what would happen if these were real,

16:12.140 --> 16:14.780
fantasia, intelligent, you know, creatures.

16:16.300 --> 16:23.100
I found very, very little trouble in coming up with an enormous variety of them.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.200
I'm not sure whether I could come up with 1,560,

16:26.200 --> 16:29.680
which is the number I would have to to visit every hex in the well world.

16:30.140 --> 16:33.240
But I've had no trouble coming up with the 200 or 300 so far.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.920
More with Jack Chalker next time.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.980
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:49.280 --> 16:52.220
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:45.460 --> 17:49.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.080
And here are your hosts.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.080
This is Daryl Lane.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.120
And David Crews.

18:22.400 --> 18:27.000
Before he became a best-selling science fiction author, Jack Chalker was an avid fan who built

18:27.000 --> 18:29.600
an amateur fanzine into a science fiction publishing company.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.800
Chalker started the fanzine in his early teens as a way of making contacts in the field of science fiction

18:34.800 --> 18:37.540
and with the possibility of making a little money at it.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.940
That basically was the reason.

18:41.160 --> 18:48.260
We started with a fanzine which was run off actually at a school at the beginning because we didn't have anything else.

18:50.460 --> 18:55.920
And he'd got some reasonably good reactions, so I started building up from there.

18:55.920 --> 19:06.500
While I was doing that, actually, I had correspondence already with enormous numbers of people, both professional and fan.

19:07.320 --> 19:14.100
I had so much correspondence, I can't believe how many people I was contacting on a regular basis.

19:14.100 --> 19:19.760
And so I started tapping them and created the fanzine Mirage.

19:20.420 --> 19:29.920
The addition of a $40 surplus mimeograph found in an old store, which I still own, by the way, which still works,

19:31.800 --> 19:35.560
I was able to start putting out a fanzine called Mirage.

19:36.720 --> 19:42.760
The fanzine was successful because of its high quality, and it led into a small publishing company, Mirage Press.

19:44.360 --> 19:50.540
I was serious and constructive at the same time that everybody else was being just sort of kid hobbyist.

19:51.060 --> 19:58.680
I really had a magazine that discussed the literature, discussed the writers and so on, past and present,

19:58.900 --> 20:01.580
at a time when very few of these were coming out.

20:01.940 --> 20:08.420
And so I attracted a rather large audience of collectors and professional writers and artists and so on.

20:08.420 --> 20:18.500
And I was able to create out of that the Mirage Press, which started off again as mimeographed publications

20:18.500 --> 20:27.060
and then later grew as capital grew into a hardcover and quality paperback publishing account.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.480
Chalker says that Mirage Press was successful from the start.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.020
I started off with a bibliography of H.P. Lovecraft, which I did myself.

20:38.840 --> 20:44.140
Put it together, mimeographed it with the help of August Derleth,

20:45.680 --> 20:49.800
who owned the rights to the H.P. Lovecraft material at the time.

20:49.800 --> 21:00.220
And sold it for what in 1960 was a horrendous fee of $1.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.040
And we sold 100 of them.

21:04.700 --> 21:09.860
Mirage Press publishes nonfiction materials such as bibliographies and critical studies of authors.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.020
Chalker leaves the publishing of fiction to the large companies.

21:14.100 --> 21:20.440
You can't compete with Doubleday, Simon & Schuster and so on for the good stuff in fiction.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.320
And although I did do a little bit of fiction,

21:26.040 --> 21:32.440
getting into print some books of work that I thought was very, very neglected,

21:33.300 --> 21:35.160
you really have to promote fiction.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.860
Whereas nonfiction and reference material is always,

21:41.020 --> 21:44.020
there's always a heavy market and there's been a growing market for it.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.800
And so I concentrated in that end.

21:47.580 --> 21:50.720
And we came up with some rather successful books,

21:50.820 --> 21:53.940
Guide to Middle Earth, which in its Ballantine form,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.440
which I still own a piece of, is still selling well,

21:57.600 --> 21:58.500
an atlas of fantasy.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.080
Obviously, we did three books on sword and sorcery fiction

22:05.080 --> 22:06.940
before the comic books discovered Conan.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.760
And occasionally we did rather odd materials,

22:12.900 --> 22:18.900
such as a collection of all of the Ferdinand Feghoot bad puns

22:19.580 --> 22:22.360
that have been published over the years, this kind of thing.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.020
Mostly, though, we were serious reference works,

22:27.020 --> 22:28.700
and we still have a number of them that are standard.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.300
Next time, more with Jack Chalker.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.740
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:45.740 --> 22:49.020
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:32.120 --> 23:36.080
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:51.960 --> 23:57.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.780
And here are your hosts.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.640
This is David Crews.

24:07.900 --> 24:08.520
And Daryl Lane.

24:09.040 --> 24:13.860
Jack Chalker's reputation was greatly enhanced by the popular Well World series of novels.

24:14.220 --> 24:19.300
Now he's at work on a new series, one which will have four books in it, entitled The Four Lords of the Diamond.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.820
Two novels have been published so far. The first is called Lilith, and the second Cerberus.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.000
Chalker comments on the story.

24:28.700 --> 24:34.500
It has a tremendous number of the elements that I have become known for.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.640
It has a lot of new material as well. It has a lot of political commentary.

24:39.220 --> 24:41.420
It has a lot of social commentary in it.

24:41.660 --> 24:47.140
It has also slam-bang action, Machiavellian intrigue, and everything else,

24:47.180 --> 24:50.820
because nobody's going to read your message if you don't entertain first.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.100
As Chalker says, the books have a lot of excitement in them.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.000
In the opening pages of Lilith, the first book in the series,

24:58.260 --> 25:03.240
a tremendously powerful alien robot penetrates a top-secret military installation on Earth.

25:03.400 --> 25:08.160
The robot's discovered, but he escapes and heads for a planetary system called the Warden Diamond.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.380
The Earth government sends its top agent.

25:12.220 --> 25:18.740
These are four worlds in one system that are basically a prison planet series,

25:18.740 --> 25:22.100
and you get dropped on there.

25:22.520 --> 25:27.020
And the foundation idea, which appeals to me an awful lot,

25:27.200 --> 25:31.500
is an alien race discovers us before we discover them,

25:32.440 --> 25:35.940
decides that it can't win a war against us.

25:35.940 --> 25:39.660
Maybe there's just not as many of them,

25:39.700 --> 25:43.480
or there's technological problems, or something like that.

25:43.980 --> 25:45.880
So they study us and study us,

25:45.940 --> 25:50.220
and they discover that, as in all human societies,

25:50.220 --> 25:52.100
there is this massive criminal syndicate,

25:53.120 --> 25:56.260
and that this criminal syndicate,

25:57.600 --> 26:04.120
leaders are mostly imprisoned for life on the four lords of the diamond,

26:04.120 --> 26:06.660
the Warden Diamond, these four worlds.

26:06.980 --> 26:15.000
So what the aliens do is they contact these bitter super crooks,

26:15.620 --> 26:18.040
and they take out a contract on human civilization.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.260
The agent can't land on any of the four worlds of the Warden Diamond.

26:23.560 --> 26:28.040
A tiny organism on these worlds enters the body and makes a person a virtual prisoner.

26:28.300 --> 26:28.760
Right.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.040
If you try to leave, you die a painful death.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.000
There seems to be no cure for it either.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.980
So what the agent does is have his personality implanted into four separate bodies,

26:37.980 --> 26:40.420
and these bodies are sent to each of the worlds.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.480
And he monitors what is happening through a computer hookup orbiting the Warden system.

26:45.480 --> 26:53.440
Part of what the book is about is that we have a sort of surrogate hymn down on each of these worlds,

26:54.560 --> 26:58.160
who starts off pretty much almost identical to him.

26:58.960 --> 27:04.080
And he's following this whole thing with his whole system of values, beliefs, and so on.

27:04.080 --> 27:09.920
And he's watching the surrogates change into quite different people.

27:10.840 --> 27:16.500
And it begins to eat away at his own sense of values, his own sense of duty.

27:17.160 --> 27:27.620
As a matter of fact, in the third book, he begins to realize that the people who sent him there on this mission anticipated this.

27:28.140 --> 27:35.240
And that his computer detective aide, who he has dialogues with and discusses everything with,

27:35.640 --> 27:36.740
may be more than that.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.520
It may be something of a watchdog.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.320
Chalker promises an exciting ending when the agent struggles with his own newly discovered values,

27:45.320 --> 27:47.500
with the computer, and with the aliens.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.720
I don't like cop-outs.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.460
I don't like stringing people along and then not delivering.

27:53.920 --> 28:02.380
So you will get real, I don't know whether you can say flesh and blood, but something, aliens,

28:03.760 --> 28:05.340
and whatever they're made of.

28:06.280 --> 28:11.060
You will meet the aliens, you will have a face down,

28:11.080 --> 28:16.740
and the solution to the whole thing and exactly what's going on is quite bizarre.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.580
And I don't think anybody's going to figure it out.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.940
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:29.120 --> 28:31.820
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:31.820 --> 28:35.080
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
