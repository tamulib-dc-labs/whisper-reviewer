The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.240 --> 00:20.460
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.000
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.740
This show will be an interview with science fiction author Joan D. Venge.

00:37.180 --> 00:41.120
Joan Venge is one of the best of the group of young science fiction authors that appeared in

00:41.120 --> 00:47.060
the 70s. Her first story, Ten Soldier, was published in 1974 and since then she's written two novels

00:47.060 --> 00:52.960
and a number of novellas and short stories. In 1977 she received a Hugo Award for one of her

00:52.960 --> 00:58.060
stories Eyes of Amber. She has experimented convincingly with a future history and with

00:58.060 --> 01:03.260
world-building and is noted for her credible and fascinating aliens. Perhaps most readers though

01:03.260 --> 01:07.680
respond most strongly to her characters. They are vividly and realistically drawn, easily

01:07.680 --> 01:11.640
identified with and they remain with the reader long after he's finished one of her stories.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.240
How did you get started writing science fiction?

01:26.860 --> 01:32.660
Well, there are sort of two versions of that in a way. There's my my official writing career,

01:32.840 --> 01:39.840
which began after I first got married to Werner Venge, my now ex-husband. He was a science fiction

01:39.840 --> 01:46.200
writer at the time and I had been a person who fooled around with writing for a while before

01:46.200 --> 01:50.900
that. I would just dintle around him that I used to want to be an artist and writing was just

01:50.900 --> 01:56.540
something I did kind of privately and never showed to anybody and rarely finished anything either.

01:57.100 --> 02:02.200
But Werner encouraged me to take it seriously if I was going to write. By that time I had

02:02.200 --> 02:07.980
abandoned wanting to be an artist because my college art professors had ruined my desire to do art

02:08.600 --> 02:14.660
and I was sort of casting about and and he knew that I like to write and so he encouraged me to

02:14.660 --> 02:22.380
attempt to take it seriously and sit down and do something and finish it. And so I decided that I

02:22.380 --> 02:28.120
would take him up on that and I started doing a story which turned out to be the first story that

02:28.120 --> 02:34.460
I sold. It was called Tin Soldier and when I started writing it I didn't know if I'd ever get it

02:34.460 --> 02:38.900
finished or anything but I did get it finished and I showed it to him and he said he thought it was

02:38.900 --> 02:45.000
available and so I started sending it out and I did sell it and after that it was hooked of course

02:45.000 --> 02:51.680
I wanted to go on being a writer. Does your background in anthropology have much influence on your writing?

02:52.620 --> 03:00.060
Well actually it does play a pretty big role in the writing because I well I find that anthropology

03:00.060 --> 03:05.340
and science fiction have a lot of things that are common for me. Archaeology was my specialty and

03:05.340 --> 03:10.440
archaeology is the anthropology of the past and science fiction for me is the anthropology of the

03:10.440 --> 03:16.780
future. They form sort of a long continuum and they both the thing I like about both science

03:16.780 --> 03:22.520
fiction and anthropology is that they they allow you to see how other people do things and that

03:22.520 --> 03:28.400
other people's lives are not led the same way yours is and that there are other ways of coping

03:29.020 --> 03:32.920
that aren't necessarily the ones you've always known that other people do things differently

03:32.920 --> 03:38.820
and get along perfectly well that way and I love the the way that both anthropology and

03:38.820 --> 03:44.060
science fiction can take your preconceptions and kind of turn them around 180 degrees and make

03:44.060 --> 03:52.520
you say gee I never thought of it like that before but specifically I like to use my anthropological

03:52.520 --> 03:58.350
background too when I'm setting up societies for the stories that I'm going to write. I do sort of

03:58.350 --> 04:04.950
an ethnography which is a cultural study only I have to make up the details of the culture in

04:04.950 --> 04:12.690
general instead of just studying an anthropological culture. I do get a lot of details bits and pieces

04:12.690 --> 04:18.350
of interesting societies which I recombine sometimes to create science fiction societies.

04:19.510 --> 04:24.310
It just it gives you a way of thinking I think that's very useful when you're writing a science

04:24.310 --> 04:30.650
fiction story looking for different ways you know hoping that that's when when you send your

04:30.650 --> 04:36.490
rocket ship out into the galaxy it's not going to come to a planet that where everyone acts like

04:37.610 --> 04:48.770
1950s earth you know I really enjoy exploring differences in societies things like that

04:50.270 --> 04:56.490
and well mythology is kind of an offshoot of anthropology that I find is very useful

04:56.490 --> 05:04.130
to science fiction too. I get a lot of story ideas from mythology and a lot of

05:05.430 --> 05:11.010
I think just kind of underlying strengths that are almost like fantasy and I like to weave them

05:11.010 --> 05:16.810
into the science fiction which is what I most like to write and I think it gives them a stronger

05:16.810 --> 05:24.070
appeal. Could that be because we have sort of a common background of folktales and myths

05:24.070 --> 05:29.850
and by weaving these in your stories you sort of reinforce or update some of the old basic

05:29.850 --> 05:35.470
stories that our culture is based on. Right yeah I think very much so I think there really are

05:35.470 --> 05:41.690
certain universalities and it's too which kind of strike everybody in a very deep and basic level

05:41.690 --> 05:47.690
and if you could capture some of that same feeling in a story when you write it maybe by

05:48.350 --> 05:53.790
employing elements consciously or unconsciously of you know out of mythology I think that you could

05:54.330 --> 05:59.830
really have a very deep emotional impact on the reader which I think is probably what every

05:59.830 --> 06:04.530
writer would like to do. I've noticed that a lot of your stories seem to have a happy ending could

06:04.530 --> 06:08.730
that be because some of them have their basis in folktales or is it because you're just basically

06:08.730 --> 06:14.390
an optimistic person? I think it's more than I'm basically an optimistic person uh actually not

06:14.390 --> 06:19.370
not every single one of my stories is based on folktales a lot of them do have those elements

06:19.370 --> 06:26.070
in them but some some don't it's just that I really I hate to leave a story feeling totally

06:26.070 --> 06:31.190
depressed by it and so I think I hate to write a story that's totally depressing frequently

06:31.190 --> 06:36.890
I think the stories have sort of bittersweet endings or you know people don't walk off hand

06:36.890 --> 06:43.010
into the sunset they're usually dragging along you know a few suitcases full of problems too

06:43.590 --> 06:49.830
but you know I think the way life is it's unrealistic usually to write a totally happy ending

06:50.410 --> 06:57.910
but I do like to have an optimistic ending when I when I read things I I relate to them on a very

06:57.910 --> 07:04.230
personal level I get very involved in the story and if it's a story the end result of which is to

07:04.230 --> 07:09.490
feel totally depressed and feel like you know why bother to live I really don't like being left

07:09.490 --> 07:16.350
feeling that way and I think I don't like feeling that way when I write too. Yes uh it seems you get

07:16.350 --> 07:20.910
very involved with your characters that you create is is it because you flesh them out so well when

07:20.910 --> 07:26.730
you create them or is it because the characters are sort of variations on yourself? Well uh

07:27.330 --> 07:32.290
I think probably some of both I think a lot of my favorite characters are

07:33.330 --> 07:39.550
you know bits and pieces of me I don't know that any one of them is all me I think all people have

07:39.550 --> 07:44.530
have different aspects of their personality which which are come to the fore at different times

07:44.530 --> 07:49.270
just in their day-to-day life and I think when you're writing you can't help but

07:50.430 --> 07:55.210
inject those personalities into characters I really do like characters in the stories

07:55.730 --> 08:01.770
I like to read about characters who seem real and so I like to try and make my own characters

08:01.770 --> 08:07.510
as real as possible when I write them and I think you know by getting inside their heads I

08:08.430 --> 08:13.770
invariably you know stick a few of my thoughts in there I do have some characters who are

08:13.770 --> 08:21.730
based on other people I know and things like that too but I do like to um I like to you know well

08:21.730 --> 08:27.850
when I write about strange things and new ideas in different societies I like to put people who

08:27.850 --> 08:33.850
recognizeably human even if they're aliens I suppose but uh people that that the reader can

08:33.850 --> 08:40.110
relate to into those situations and let the reader see how the human being reacts to the strange set

08:40.110 --> 08:45.550
of circumstances it's not simply the strange set of circumstances which interests me although that's

08:45.550 --> 08:50.050
I think why I like science fiction because I like I don't like to write about the same old day-to-day

08:50.050 --> 08:57.270
thing I like to explore new ground but I like to do it with actual characters who you come as close

08:57.270 --> 09:02.790
as possible to see me like real people I like to see what they do in given circumstances

09:04.730 --> 09:08.770
yes science fiction is the only literature which allows you to explore the future

09:09.350 --> 09:13.290
which opens up quite a few vistas that mainstream literature just doesn't have

09:13.290 --> 09:21.410
right and that's really what I like about science fiction I think I read my first science fiction

09:21.410 --> 09:26.770
book when I was in ninth grade and I just felt like you know boy where has this been all my life

09:27.270 --> 09:32.610
I just swept away by it and I felt like I really hardly wanted to read anything but science fiction

09:32.610 --> 09:38.710
after that it was just it was just so exciting to me to know that these new worlds opened up to me

09:39.410 --> 09:45.830
yes I remember one of the characters in eyes of amber is a singer a songwriter and it seems like

09:45.830 --> 09:53.150
music plays an important role in your writing yes it really does actually I I seem to relate to

09:53.710 --> 10:00.910
music on the kind of supplemental level I guess it's something like operate something like mythology

10:00.910 --> 10:07.670
for me when I hear a song I I frequently get down into the song and start wondering what's going on

10:07.670 --> 10:14.250
in the background of it you know the situation is set up in the song leads me to think well who are

10:14.250 --> 10:19.390
the people involved in this and and how did they get here and what is this talking about actually

10:19.390 --> 10:24.690
I tend to relate to songs in a very personal way that they they have a kind of reality about them

10:24.690 --> 10:30.090
is that I frequently can't help thinking that that the songwriter must have written that about his

10:30.090 --> 10:35.930
or her own experience even though I know it's no more likely that they did and that someone writing

10:35.930 --> 10:43.550
fiction necessarily wrote a story about their own life but I just I just enjoy music tremendously

10:43.550 --> 10:50.730
and it really stimulates creative juices for me so I frequently do wind up being inspired to

10:50.730 --> 10:56.670
write certain things by by listening to music in fact eyes of amber the the title of that story

10:56.670 --> 11:03.710
is taken from the song by Buffy St. Marie which is about someone who knows a demon lover and

11:03.710 --> 11:10.850
sort of fit into the context of the story where the alien woman thinks of of the space probe as

11:10.850 --> 11:17.990
as a demon and she relates to it because it does respond to her although she doesn't know what's

11:17.990 --> 11:23.570
the human being on earth she relates to it as another being and this is kind of a fascination

11:23.570 --> 11:29.810
for it and it's just taking little elements like that and working with interest and race

11:30.370 --> 11:35.830
and it's one of the pleasures of writing for me since you do have a rather good background in

11:35.830 --> 11:40.670
anthropology uh how do you go about constructing your aliens oh that's an interesting question

11:40.670 --> 11:47.410
actually uh I don't think I have any any particular method for constructing aliens they

11:47.410 --> 11:53.510
they frequently kind of arise out of other givens in the situation and out of the environment

11:53.890 --> 12:00.750
in eyes of amber the the aliens although they they seem superficially humanoid we're actually

12:02.270 --> 12:05.830
constructed for an entirely different nitrogen breathing

12:06.370 --> 12:15.550
uh in this situation on a world than one of the in one of the moons of saturn world which was

12:15.550 --> 12:22.570
extremely cold and uh they were tri-supiens which meant that they they spent part of the time with

12:22.570 --> 12:30.130
the sky part of the land and part in the water uh the creatures in crystal ship were sort of marsupial

12:30.130 --> 12:38.410
like and uh the creatures and my story to bell the cat thrived on radiation they just lived on

12:38.410 --> 12:47.470
pure radiation they they lived in essentially a uh a hot you know incredibly radioactively hot swamp

12:47.470 --> 12:54.810
on a planet uh hidden away in a cave but there's actually no real pattern to any of them the the

12:54.810 --> 12:59.670
creatures living in the cave came out of the idea of there being essentially natural nuclear

12:59.670 --> 13:05.830
reactors uh forming on the earth or there's an article somewhere about uh how there seemed to be

13:05.830 --> 13:11.470
the fossil remains of one somewhere in Africa I think seemed that at some point uh a concentration

13:11.470 --> 13:19.070
of ore had gotten so so radioactively hot that it had actually started uh a thermo nuclear reaction

13:19.070 --> 13:26.050
not a bomb but just a kind of a a roiling boiling situation and so I had these creatures that it

13:26.050 --> 13:31.690
told from whole planets like that and it'd been shipwrecked essentially on this uh planets which

13:31.690 --> 13:37.110
would be normal to human beings and they had had managed to find this spot and take refuge in it

13:37.110 --> 13:42.590
and it was just uh you know it came out of trying to think of what sort of creatures would live in

13:42.590 --> 13:48.150
that environment uh I suppose I unless the general start with the environment and then try to think

13:48.150 --> 13:56.590
about what sort of adaptations would be necessary to it I don't know the the aliens are are one of

13:56.590 --> 14:01.890
those things that just sort of spring out of the unconscious I guess I don't I don't really have

14:01.890 --> 14:07.670
the pattern for creating them uh except that I start with certain givens of the of the culture

14:08.310 --> 14:13.310
what are the problems with creating aliens is that if you if you make them too alien then the reader

14:13.310 --> 14:18.050
can't understand them or relate to them and they just seem to be essentially nonsensical

14:18.730 --> 14:23.790
it's very difficult to try to convey a feeling of alienness and yet something that

14:23.790 --> 14:29.590
that a human being can still relate to and not simply say uh you know what is this a junk I don't

14:29.590 --> 14:34.870
understand this stop reading look a lot of science fiction writers have talked about that there's

14:34.870 --> 14:40.930
our frequently accusations about well you know the aliens are not really alien enough but then you

14:40.930 --> 14:47.230
come down to the old bottom line that if they are alien enough even if a if one human being can

14:47.230 --> 14:53.610
imagine something that alien someone else we don't understand it so you're always caught in the mind

14:53.610 --> 14:58.930
when you're writing about aliens. In To Bell the Cat you've created one of the most alien aliens

14:58.930 --> 15:06.690
I've ever encountered the being as I understand it uh is in two parts uh the intelligence is located

15:06.690 --> 15:12.970
deep in a cave and uh it controls its mobile parts the little creatures uh and all other parts of

15:12.970 --> 15:18.710
the cave and out on the surface but but its thought processes are amazing how did you come up with this idea?

15:20.310 --> 15:27.050
This reminds me of a story about Robert Browning when a woman asked him one time what one of his

15:27.050 --> 15:33.430
poems meant and he said, matter when I wrote that only God and I knew what it meant and now only God knows

15:33.950 --> 15:39.490
I can't actually remember how I came up with that idea it's terrible I don't know whether it's in my

15:39.490 --> 15:45.790
notes anywhere or not um I think it must have grown kind of grown out of the idea of specialization

15:46.350 --> 15:53.090
in animals where you know um a human being is is biologically speaking a very un-specialized

15:53.090 --> 15:59.090
creature because it has fingernails which are the most primitive form of thing as opposed to a claw

15:59.090 --> 16:06.750
or hoof which are which are um adaptations you know specializations of nails and um you know

16:06.750 --> 16:12.590
there are various other things about the human body which are uh quote primitive biologically

16:12.590 --> 16:18.530
and I I guess I may have been thinking about uh specialization developing to an extreme where

16:18.530 --> 16:24.870
actual different uh parts of the body became separate entities and they were all controlled

16:24.870 --> 16:31.350
by the mind which stayed in one spot some of the specialized parts were particularly strong and

16:31.350 --> 16:37.090
some were particularly agile things like that and they could be sent out kind of far ranging and

16:37.090 --> 16:44.450
controlled telepathically by the brain which just stayed at home in safety and uh said there were

16:44.450 --> 16:53.590
essentially two levels of organism which made up one creature one and then the the um the specialized

16:54.130 --> 16:59.610
creatures that the that the brain controlled had no particular brain of their own sort of a

16:59.610 --> 17:04.390
a rudimentary receiver so then it could send them into commands and it could receive back from

17:05.550 --> 17:12.010
various impressions of what they were doing I I wound up the way they communicate became sort of

17:12.010 --> 17:17.590
like writing poetry for me I used to like direct poetry and this came as close to million as I had

17:17.590 --> 17:22.310
for a long time and then while the the brain creatures were communicating with each other

17:23.590 --> 17:28.910
with the other brains and discussing their plight they were at the same time receiving input and

17:28.910 --> 17:35.210
sending directions to all their mobiles their little specialized parts that were moving around

17:35.210 --> 17:42.310
in the radioactive muck and uh so you would get their their basic commentary and then all the

17:42.950 --> 17:51.830
levels below that of interaction and I I really enjoyed writing about that I I thought it was

17:51.830 --> 17:58.090
quite quite exciting when I was doing it but the trouble is that I think I only found one person

17:58.090 --> 18:04.450
who who actually understood without having it explained to them what was going on in that

18:04.450 --> 18:09.250
story I wasn't sure what I understood and I felt like that was the case where my aliens had got

18:09.250 --> 18:15.190
two aliens for their own good you've undertaken another difficult writing task uh that being

18:15.190 --> 18:21.150
world building in your novel the snow queen it's a it's a wonderful work of science fantasy uh you

18:21.150 --> 18:27.830
would call it science fantasy wouldn't you um I suppose so actually uh it it is you know in

18:27.830 --> 18:32.770
its heart it's a science fiction story but it does have heavy mythological elements which I think

18:32.770 --> 18:38.730
give it a fantasy like quality and I I wasn't fighting that at all I was I was striving for a

18:38.730 --> 18:45.470
sort of fiction oh good well then I can call it a wonderful work of science fantasy it's got a very

18:45.470 --> 18:50.390
involved plot and a very exciting narrative uh this must have taken a tremendous amount of

18:50.390 --> 18:57.730
background development yes probably um oh gosh that that book was it was quite an incredible

18:57.730 --> 19:04.210
thing for me to write that book because I wound up being about it was over 600 pages of manuscript

19:04.210 --> 19:11.510
it's almost 200 000 words long and um when I started writing it I had never written a complete

19:11.510 --> 19:16.770
novel all at once I'm with outcast of heaven delta I had written the novella and then I had

19:16.770 --> 19:25.890
um increased in size to have a novel and I was feeling kind of daunted about the very idea of

19:25.890 --> 19:31.930
of writing a normal what I thought would be a normal length novel about 200 pages um so but I

19:31.930 --> 19:37.510
thought I finally did sit down and start to write it and the the more I wrote the more I realized

19:37.510 --> 19:42.610
that it was not going to stop at 200 pages I think I had you've gotten through 100 pages and realized

19:42.610 --> 19:48.230
that I had barely gotten into the plot at all my writing and from then on I could only just go on

19:48.230 --> 19:52.570
and write and write and write and see where it led me it got more and more complicated as it went

19:52.570 --> 19:58.650
along until I really disparate at times that I would ever be able to finish the thing it was a

19:58.650 --> 20:02.990
great comfort to me when I finally sat down and figured out how everything had to fit together

20:02.990 --> 20:10.050
it gets to the end of the book uh okay I did well I did a fair amount of background work beforehand

20:10.050 --> 20:14.770
but actually I wound up doing a great deal of the work I think during the process of writing the

20:14.770 --> 20:23.830
book I had I conceived of the idea of the of the the wicked city of carbuncle which gets its name

20:23.830 --> 20:29.310
because it's either a jewel or a fester depending on your point of view but I wanted it to be sort of

20:29.310 --> 20:35.210
a place where all kinds of cultures from all kinds of worlds came together and and mixed and

20:35.210 --> 20:40.950
mingled and um and trying to make a portrait of the city I needed a lot of different characters with

20:40.950 --> 20:49.390
a lot of different backgrounds behind them and so I I um I would I would whenever I needed a new

20:49.390 --> 20:53.050
character I would write one into the story and then I come have to figure out where they came from

20:54.070 --> 20:59.230
um I was frequently I don't lay everything out before I actually start to write a book I have

20:59.230 --> 21:03.930
kind of a basic structure which I think it was being sort of like a trellis and then the story is

21:03.930 --> 21:10.510
a line that grows up through it and fills it in and flushes it out and things and um I think because

21:10.510 --> 21:17.510
I didn't have any idea of how big the snow queen was going to be it got even more complex you know

21:17.510 --> 21:22.410
in in the process than most of the things most of the things I have a clearer idea ahead of time

21:22.410 --> 21:26.390
of what they're going to be about but it was just so massive it was impossible to think about

21:26.390 --> 21:31.870
everything ahead of time it was mostly the scientific research I think that I did ahead of time and

21:31.870 --> 21:37.790
reading up on black holes and things like that I um I regret that black holes and clones became

21:37.790 --> 21:44.930
such kind of stereotypes during the time which are a beautiful book they work they were not quite

21:44.930 --> 21:52.010
such archetypal sci-fi cliches when I started writing the book as they are now but um at least

21:52.010 --> 21:56.930
since I hope the book will appeal to a wide audience at least um maybe people who don't even

21:56.930 --> 22:01.570
regularly read science fiction will know what I'm talking about and I'm talking about black holes

22:01.570 --> 22:08.510
and clones at this point but I did um I did do a fair amount of of technical reading or

22:08.510 --> 22:15.470
semi-technical reading on the nature of black holes and using them as means of travel in order to

22:15.470 --> 22:24.350
to set up the you know the basic science fictional premises of the book and I did I happened to read

22:24.350 --> 22:30.870
Robert Graves book the white goddess just before I started writing the snow queen and that

22:30.870 --> 22:37.110
I found that influenced me heavily and that I got a lot of of the the mythical fantasy type elements

22:37.630 --> 22:45.570
out of that and kind of wove them into the texture texture of the book and um and I tried to create

22:45.570 --> 22:51.010
societies which would kind of fit in with the most technical and non-technical societies which would

22:51.010 --> 22:58.090
fit comfortably with with kind of the underlying themes and premises of the book and from there I

22:58.090 --> 23:07.570
just uh things just grow like topsy I can't say one of the characters who comes from a very advanced

23:07.570 --> 23:14.830
society the most technically uh technologically dominant society in the book started out as a

23:14.830 --> 23:21.190
walk-on character his name is Gundelino and he came along with uh one of the major characters of the

23:21.190 --> 23:27.170
book in the scene and he just started acting up and out of his personality I I kind of saw a whole

23:27.170 --> 23:32.890
cultural stereotype growing and I realized part of actually part of where he came from was I had

23:32.890 --> 23:37.730
been reading a lot of books about I've been reading some fiction books about Romans and Britain because

23:37.730 --> 23:44.150
I've always been fascinated by Romans and Britain as part of the archaeology thing I guess and just

23:44.150 --> 23:49.070
the kind of fascination with the it was it was the sort of science fictional reversal where

23:49.070 --> 23:57.410
um you know the uh you know the the highly cultured people are are the people who too often wind up

23:57.410 --> 24:03.510
in certain sorcery fantasies you know the kind of dark and swarthy people and they're you know

24:03.510 --> 24:07.490
they're usually spouting around in the bushes but they were the people who were swab sophisticated

24:07.490 --> 24:12.030
and on top and the people with red hair and freckles and green eyes were were running around

24:12.030 --> 24:18.650
like howling barbarians in the brush and I thought that was a delightful twist but um just thinking

24:18.650 --> 24:24.770
about this about cultural arrogance and how the Romans sort of uh resembled Victorian English in

24:24.770 --> 24:30.710
that way I I just got into a mindset to write about that sort of character I think and so

24:30.710 --> 24:36.790
you know without even realizing it this particular character just began taking on all these aspects

24:36.790 --> 24:41.730
and out of him I realized what his whole culture must be like and it became one of the important

24:44.910 --> 24:51.130
societies in the book and um I just our odd little things happened like that this whole book

24:51.130 --> 24:56.350
kind of grew up in a strange way it was quite an indescribable thing and if I had known ahead of

24:56.350 --> 25:01.190
time when I was getting into I would never have started it probably just as well that we can't

25:01.190 --> 25:08.650
see the future I think. Oh yes um correct me if I'm wrong but didn't I read somewhere that your

25:08.650 --> 25:15.550
story is based upon the hands Christian Anderson fairytale call The Snow Queen? Oh yes it is as

25:15.550 --> 25:23.430
a matter of fact that was my original inspiration for the book um there's a a cartoon and an animated

25:23.430 --> 25:29.090
movie of The Snow Queen which they occasionally show on television if you can wait through 15

25:29.090 --> 25:33.810
minutes of art link letter talking to children at the beginning of it it's really quite well done

25:33.810 --> 25:39.710
um I was interested in it you know I had first seen that movie when I was in about eighth grade

25:39.710 --> 25:46.310
and oh this is silly but when I saw it again uh back during the 70s sometime I I realized what

25:46.310 --> 25:53.090
an interesting fairytale it is um it's most fairytale the thing about most fairytales is that they

25:53.090 --> 26:00.010
are frequently degenerate mythology and if you know uh any particular amount about Near Eastern

26:00.010 --> 26:07.530
and European mythology you see a lot of symbolic archetypes you see ravens and stags and and

26:08.470 --> 26:14.930
wicked stepmother and the sweet young innocence and things like that which um you know they they

26:14.930 --> 26:22.090
all actually have their archetypes back in in in European and Near Eastern mythology and that

26:22.090 --> 26:30.030
well that just as an aside that was why um the Robert Graves book on the on the white goddess and

26:30.030 --> 26:36.430
on on all that mythology in Europe and the Near East fit in so perfectly with this particular

26:36.970 --> 26:44.470
story and Hans Christian Anderson had written down but was essentially one of these old tales

26:44.470 --> 26:49.610
which are kind of twisted up mythology and the thing that interested me especially about this

26:49.610 --> 26:56.350
particular tale was that there was no prince in it um that's usually prince who gets to do all the

26:56.350 --> 27:01.650
fun and exciting things like fighting the dragons and things like that and waking up to the sleeping

27:01.650 --> 27:06.750
maiden and the and the women in the story are usually either the wicked old witch or um some

27:06.750 --> 27:12.830
helpless simplaring creature and um you know I get sort of bored with that kind of thing but I was

27:12.830 --> 27:18.450
very interested this book was quite a twist because or this fairytale was quite a twist because

27:18.450 --> 27:25.550
all the all the main roles in it were played by women uh the basic idea of the story is that

27:25.550 --> 27:30.330
they're a little girl and a little boy who are friends and the little boy is still on way by the

27:30.330 --> 27:36.010
Snow Queen who is kind of an elemental goddess of winter and most of the story concerns the little

27:36.010 --> 27:41.950
girl's um travels as she's searching for him and all the people she meets and the people she meets are

27:42.370 --> 27:47.470
uh all virtually all female and the people in positions of power in the story are women

27:47.470 --> 27:53.470
and I thought I thought that was quite interesting and unique and I was in the mood to do a story

27:53.470 --> 28:00.650
in which major women played major roles in the book and um so I thought that was a good jumping

28:00.650 --> 28:08.630
off point for it and uh so I you know from there everything else just started growing basically

28:08.630 --> 28:15.870
I read Robert Graves book and I said boy this gives me a lot more fuel for the fire and I just

28:15.870 --> 28:20.370
started writing at that point I didn't I didn't want to write a fantasy though I didn't want to

28:20.370 --> 28:26.290
just make it a retelling of the fairytale basically I really wanted it to be a whole new story and I

28:26.290 --> 28:31.890
wanted it to be science fiction as well because that's just the way my brain works I guess I have

28:31.890 --> 28:36.570
written a couple of fantasy stories recently you know I've always enjoyed reading fantasy as well

28:36.570 --> 28:44.210
as science fiction but so far the majority of my work has been at least technically science fiction

28:45.870 --> 28:45.910
so

28:55.810 --> 28:59.590
author critic and editor Ben Bova has praised Joan Venge for blending

28:59.590 --> 29:05.270
believable science with believable characters no easy task the best way to know and appreciate

29:05.270 --> 29:10.110
Joan Venge is to buy one of her books and start reading for those who do there should be no

29:10.110 --> 29:25.250
disappointments this is David Cruz and David Carson this has been the science fiction radio show

29:25.250 --> 29:31.770
a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association in conjunction with KOCVFM

29:31.770 --> 29:33.970
