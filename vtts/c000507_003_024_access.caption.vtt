00:03.900 --> 00:19.380
I'm on the phone.

00:20.940 --> 00:30.720
Daryl John, I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I'm on the
phone. Daryl John, I'm on the phone. Daryl John, I'm on the phone. Daryl John, I

00:30.720 --> 00:40.820
got some other people coming on the line here who are working on the show.
Daryl, are you on the line? Yes. Howdy. Okay, Dave, are you on the line? Okay,

00:41.380 --> 00:53.200
Dave's getting the levels set. Go ahead. How's the weather out in Florida? I
haven't looked out the window today. I think it's been pretty cloudy and a lot

00:53.200 --> 01:01.820
taller than we've been having. I think we've been having an easier time for you.
You said this morning you were pretty high up but maybe you missed the worst of

01:01.820 --> 01:09.580
it. It's been fairly. We're in our rainy season. We've had a lot of rain in the
last couple of weeks. Yeah, I was out there in September. I managed to hit

01:09.580 --> 01:17.940
Hurricane Frederick and Hurricane David. I was up in Washington DC and I got
roasted. I was in New York City and I got roasted and I came back to Florida and

01:17.940 --> 01:32.500
cut down. Now that's the irony. Pretty good. How are the levels, Dave? Dave, are
you on the line? Yes, I'm here. Okay, you got the levels set? Yes. Tape rolling.

01:32.820 --> 01:45.040
Right. Okay. Hi. Okay, the next voice will be David Cruz. Hi there. And the
other voice is Darrell Lane. Glad to meet you, Mr. Fogum. Likewise. There are

01:45.040 --> 01:58.980
three as your end and one here. Right. I'm out behind. Okay. Okay, yeah, we're
the team that puts together the show. Yeah, the line is a little bit faint. Your

01:58.980 --> 02:09.480
voice drops here and there and I miss a syllable. Okay, we'll try and be
distinct on this end. It's a warning one somehow. It would help me. Okay,

02:09.580 --> 02:19.100
everybody's speaking to the mouthpiece real good. Okay, I think Darrell's going
to lead off with a question. We're going to first be talking about your book Two

02:19.100 --> 02:29.920
Faces tomorrow. Uh-huh. Yeah, Mr. Hogan, you have some people in the novel, I
think Hayes, and maybe Frank Westcott too, that mention that machines might be

02:29.920 --> 02:37.960
the next step in evolution. Yeah. That there's a natural movement from organic
life to inorganic. Right. Do you personally believe this or is that just a

02:37.960 --> 02:49.000
notion you play with? A bit of both, really. It's one way of interpreting the
direction that we seem to be moving in. I don't set myself up under profit. I

02:49.000 --> 03:03.800
like to play with things that might be thrown and get pictures around them. I
apply the word evolution not to the restricted sense to biological species, but

03:03.800 --> 03:15.580
to the universal process that characterizes the emergence of more complex and
more highly ordered systems, out of simpler systems. The way we're in this issue

03:15.580 --> 03:23.700
is entropy reversal. We've got a lot of doom plotting these days who are worried
about energy running out, and the latest word they've ratched on to is entropy,

03:24.500 --> 03:35.780
and the universe is all going to run down and we'll have to wind down the wicks
in our oil lamps to ration things out so the universe will run another day. And

03:35.780 --> 03:47.000
I think they're listing the word entropy out of its scientific context and
applying it really without a full understanding of its meaning. Entropy

03:47.000 --> 03:56.660
increases naturally in a closed system. In other words, one that is isolated
physically or functionally from its environment, particularly from an energy

03:56.660 --> 04:07.520
source. It seems to be the universal tendency, and I use the term universal and
in this world then, tendency throughout the universe. The systems that are

04:07.520 --> 04:22.400
experience and energy throughput, to actually self-organize for more complex
structures to emerge. Going right back to the primordial pattern of stellar in

04:22.400 --> 04:32.440
series, or whatever became maybe for that, we had raw nuclei, and then when the
temperatures drop a little, electrons shift stately around the nucleus to form

04:32.440 --> 04:41.540
the atoms. Then when you get down to the temperature of a planetary surface,
molecules begin to form progressively more complex and more fragile molecules

04:41.540 --> 04:54.700
than the temperature reduces, until eventually you get life. It's eventually
intelligence. And each step in the process, the whole, the thrust of the

04:54.700 --> 05:06.720
underlying process seems to be to produce more complex, more energy-intensive
systems that operated a higher energy throughput from lower ones. At the latest

05:06.720 --> 05:17.020
stage in the network we term life the more recent part of the spectrum, and it's
far broader than that. And each step along the way seems to be the prerequisite

05:17.020 --> 05:26.880
to the next. It couldn't have life until we had organic molecules, it couldn't
have a brain. It couldn't have intelligence and we had a brain. And now that the

05:26.880 --> 05:36.840
brain has appeared, well, what is that, what could that be considered a
prerequisite for? It's a guided intelligence to make machines. And I see no raw

05:36.840 --> 05:45.740
image or no principle of the third machine towards the nonintelligence, I'll
take it and we'll be coming up again later. So it seems to be simply another

05:45.740 --> 05:56.200
step along the way to extrapolate the process. And by the same token I see
absolutely nothing unnatural without the applied intelligence,

06:11.680 --> 06:22.340
the totality of human society. What comes after that, I don't know. You know,
that's a very interesting answer. David told me to hold it for just a second.

06:22.500 --> 06:28.700
He's plugging in another machine to increase the clarity. OK. Maybe it's the
accident, I think the wind is concerned to... No.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.040
Can you hear us OK? Yeah, you're coming through. OK, let me get the machine
running again.

06:51.800 --> 06:58.780
OK. Yeah, I think we're back now. Yeah, I think we had some tape, some leaks. It
sounded like a data processing type. I think there was maybe a computer trying

06:58.780 --> 06:59.560
to get on the line.

07:02.840 --> 07:14.800
Maybe they're trying to tell us something. Yeah. He's checking out the tape
machine real quick. OK, James, talk to me for just a second. Excuse me? Speak to

07:14.800 --> 07:15.460
me so I can get a level.

07:18.580 --> 07:24.860
Just say a few words there so we... Do you need to set the levels again or
something? Yeah, there we go. That's got it just fine. I'll leave with you. OK.

07:25.140 --> 07:25.320
Good.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.100
Zero.

07:39.020 --> 07:48.080
David, you back with us? Yes. Go ahead, Darrell. I see more traffic. David,
Cruz, why don't you go ahead? Take your turn. Mr. Hogan, I understand that you

07:48.080 --> 07:56.760
work with computers yourself. Do you know how far that we have come toward
having a computer program like Hesper that makes a common sense type of

07:56.760 --> 07:59.820
judgment? Not very far, I suspect.

08:02.640 --> 08:15.640
It's interesting to us if we look at the process of evolution of physical forms.
And that's why we're the ones that we're not as big as we do. I've seen the fact

08:15.640 --> 08:28.020
that we're not getting into it. We've seen the fact

08:28.020 --> 08:35.200
that we're not getting into it. We've seen the fact that we're not getting into
it. We're seeing the fact that we're not getting into it. We can't see that this

08:35.200 --> 08:39.600
is a long time. We're seeing the fact that we're not getting into it. We're
seeing the fact that we're not getting into it.

09:06.140 --> 09:20.800
We're seeing the fact that we're not getting into it. But, in that process, we
begin to pick out a lot of the basic ingredients that pretty well everybody

09:20.800 --> 09:32.760
would agree are necessary components of what we normally termed inhabitants. For
example, I am answering your question. I'm going to run around about kind of

09:32.760 --> 09:38.400
weight. I am working on a lot of the data, and there is a lot of the data that
we have in the movement. The earliest jellyfish or the sponges, let's go back to

09:38.400 --> 09:50.920
the sponges, involved specialized cells that responded to stimuli tactile
stimuli in the environment and produced reflex reactions such as expanding a

09:50.920 --> 09:59.540
cell and increasing the probability of filtering through the water. And by the
time you get the jellyfish, it is the cells that are specialized and connected

09:59.540 --> 10:09.980
up into a primitive neural network that is coordinating the whole organism. They
are not just part of it. Later on we get concentrations of neural tissues that

10:09.980 --> 10:21.960
are occurring into the brain. They are not just part of it. And as the brain
develops through successively my own animals, the entities that are processed in

10:21.960 --> 10:34.620
the brain become progressively further removed from the raw physical sensory
data that comes in from the outside world. They become more abstract, more

10:34.620 --> 10:44.820
removed from the reality and more symbolic. Why? For example, the ultimate
expression of the purpose of a human being. The entities that we manipulate in

10:44.820 --> 10:57.380
our minds are well physically, excuse me. The quantities that impinge on our
senses are pressure waves, electromagnetic waves, physical contact. In terms of

10:57.380 --> 11:08.180
basic physics, we don't perceive the world around us or ourselves in many terms.
We manipulate symbolic representations of people, friends, enemies, places,

11:08.900 --> 11:17.420
emotions, and all the complicated things that go together to make up the world
model of the complex organism that are acting to the complex environment at a

11:17.420 --> 11:28.580
high level. And along the way the organism would be building up the environment
and the environment and the if it's in selection of abstract symbols would be

11:28.580 --> 11:39.260
necessary to develop a world model. An analogue of the world around it, which
necessarily makes the form of a three-dimensional model impacted by objects.

11:42.500 --> 11:47.460
Then if its

11:47.460 --> 11:54.740
leading

11:54.740 --> 12:06.180
to survive, the world is the same. It becomes the primary driving force, then. A
very necessary function to evolve the notion of self-seeking survival and to

12:06.180 --> 12:15.700
protect that distinct and distinct from the other, but the remainder of the
environment which is a secondary form. So the kind of self-image within that

12:15.700 --> 12:25.280
environment becomes more pretty hard to escape, not to put it in evolutionary
terms. Once its self-image began to emerge, it will be very very strongly

12:25.280 --> 12:32.700
reinforced. a little bit of a very strong movement, but the same thing is what
you need to do. And if you're going up to the wall complex, I believe, you can

12:32.700 --> 12:38.460
get the station

12:38.460 --> 12:39.020
of... ...

12:55.480 --> 13:01.120
Yes, sir. The, um...

13:20.720 --> 13:29.020
Let me ask you... Let me ask you something that's along those lines. Yeah. Well,
we're getting there.

13:32.520 --> 13:43.760
The... The... At, uh... Another function that would have its enormous survival
value is when it's when we've now got in mind that to manipulate symbolic

13:43.760 --> 13:54.420
representations of the universe around it, the world around it, the objects in
having that universe, uh, this is to stretch that ability and start to play with

13:54.420 --> 14:07.280
combinations of symbols that don't actually represent the world as it is, but
represent the world as it could be. In other words, it takes its existing set of

14:07.280 --> 14:19.140
symbols and starts to combine them in new ways. It can have, it can build models
of possible dangers or threats that could affect its well-being and take timely

14:19.140 --> 14:30.420
action to avoid them. In other words, the faculty of anticipation. And if, which
again would have strong survival values. And if the faculty of anticipation is

14:30.420 --> 14:40.800
nothing more than playing with familiar symbols and unfamiliar combinations, in
other words, playing with worlds that might exist, I don't think we're very much

14:40.800 --> 14:49.940
of a step away from creativity and imagination. It seems to be an extension of
the same process. And once we're up at that level of complexity, there are so

14:49.940 --> 15:00.960
many things going on in the mind that, uh, there are obviously when evaluating
the responses of the situations demanding, uh, like a computer operating system

15:00.960 --> 15:09.960
that might begin to, to make the whole thing work, be some kind of an overseeing
process that can distinguish between the things that are immediate in survival

15:09.960 --> 15:18.220
now, like the climate happening down the hill. Um, and other things that will
become threats later that can be disturbed that we're trying to be like getting

15:18.220 --> 15:28.920
hungry. Which, it really implies some kind of monitoring process of the mind's
own functions, in other words, an awareness of what's going on inside it. And if

15:28.920 --> 15:38.900
we couple that faculty of awareness with the self-image that we've already
postulated, surely we have self-awareness, uh, with creativity and imagination.

15:39.140 --> 15:48.980
Do we really mean any more than that than we say mind? Uh, I would say no. Uh,
and now answering your question, I'd say that it's because of computers. Uh,

15:49.140 --> 15:58.920
probably computers that we have right now in the most advanced models are kind
of analogous to that earlier, in jellyfish. Uh, you apply a given set of

15:58.920 --> 16:10.520
stimuli, and, uh, the predictable response results in the behavior pattern is
very rigid and very uh, very, just very predictable and very mechanical. But,

16:10.840 --> 16:21.480
uh, our minds operate, here, people sometimes use this as an objection, they say
that a computer could, or, not necessarily a computer, any form of man may

16:21.480 --> 16:30.820
insist it would be a machine and never think and do all the things that we imply
that we use the word mind. So, uh, because it's built of mechanical components

16:30.820 --> 16:41.260
like integrated circuits, that are predictable, they, they always give the same
output response or given input. Um, and there is many of the element of whimsy

16:41.260 --> 16:49.200
or unpredictableness of characterizing the human being. So, I think they're
missing a point, you could see, you could make exactly the same statement

16:49.200 --> 17:00.220
regarding the human brain. Now that it's fundamental on hardware levels, the
brain consists of the neurons. Uh, the inputs to a neuron are outputs from other

17:00.220 --> 17:13.080
cells. Some of them inhibitory and some excitory. And, uh, given a certain
combination of inputs, a tiny micro-program, if you will, operating within the

17:13.080 --> 17:25.060
cell simply to, processes all those inputs and provides a single output that
goes to one side. And the cell either fires or it doesn't come out. So, uh, uh,

17:31.080 --> 17:35.520
uh,

17:39.360 --> 17:43.580
the

17:43.580 --> 17:44.100
most powerful things that we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do,
we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do, we can do. So,

17:44.100 --> 17:52.080
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

17:52.080 --> 17:56.540

sort of inspiration for Two Faces of Tomorrow. What brought on the novel?

24:22.560 --> 24:25.880
I can't do it.

24:29.120 --> 24:34.640
What brought on

24:34.640 --> 24:40.720
the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on
the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on

24:40.720 --> 24:47.520
the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on the novel? What brought on
the novel? What brought on the novel?
