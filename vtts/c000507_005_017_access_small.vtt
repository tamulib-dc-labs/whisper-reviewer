Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.280
And here are your hosts.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.220
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.140
And David Cruz.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.300
Norman Spinrad has strong opinions about science fiction in its place in today's world.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.680
As a noted author who helped bring the science fiction new wave to this country, and as a

00:53.680 --> 00:57.640
two-time president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad's ideas should

00:57.640 --> 00:58.120
be heard.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.820
One thing he feels strongly about is that science fiction has not been treated fairly

01:01.820 --> 01:02.580
by book reviewers.

01:03.520 --> 01:12.320
As a category, it is treated very unfairly and very cavalierly by the powers that be,

01:12.420 --> 01:18.820
which is mainly the New York Times book review and the New York Review of Books and the so-called

01:18.820 --> 01:22.900
New York Literary Establishment, which really does have a very heavy effect on the way books

01:22.900 --> 01:23.280
are published.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.960
These people, for instance, came down on the American Book Awards, succeeded in getting

01:28.960 --> 01:31.280
science fiction knocked out of the American Book Awards.

01:31.860 --> 01:37.000
A real small clique of people in New York City who felt that it was really bad to have

01:37.000 --> 01:41.440
these awards given to things like science fiction, that it was bad to take it away from

01:41.440 --> 01:45.160
a small jury which they could control and have thousands of people voting for.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.360
A very elitist, social fascist bunch of people who I absolutely no use for.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.520
And I'm sure they have no use for me.

01:53.740 --> 01:57.720
As president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad has worked for some changes

01:57.720 --> 01:58.320
in the field.

01:59.500 --> 02:04.440
One thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is the international eyes, is

02:04.440 --> 02:07.720
to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of directors.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.280
Because science fiction writing and publishing really is an international community, American

02:12.280 --> 02:14.500
writers sell their work all over the world.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.200
English writers sell their work here.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.780
Foreign language writers have different problems.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.740
And we're all dealing with the same publishers.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.020
It certainly is an international literature and it's the spirit of the future and the

02:26.020 --> 02:27.140
spirit of internationalism.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.520
So of course I felt it should be an international organization.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.140
That's one thing.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.640
The other thing that I want to do and halfway through doing is upgrading the Nebula Awards.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.280
We have moved it out of the world.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.340
At Hotel we're moving into a much bigger room.

02:40.420 --> 02:44.420
And the world are trying to make it into a more significant event than it has been.

02:44.840 --> 02:49.260
Again, orienting it towards the world at large rather than towards the little in group.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.780
Spinrad has always been concerned with the image science fiction has with the general public.

02:54.780 --> 02:58.920
He thinks general readers should be made more aware of science fiction's unique possibilities

02:58.920 --> 03:00.340
and its genuine value.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.420
We asked him if science fiction movies have a positive or negative influence on the public's image of the field.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.460
Well, I don't know.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.600
I don't think they... not really.

03:10.140 --> 03:13.680
I mean, the image of science fiction in that respect has been very bad anyway.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.560
I don't think the movies really add to the image, but I don't think they detract from it either.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.640
If there are some better, more sophisticated movies they might help.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.400
As it is, it's just kind of neutral publicity, people more aware that it exists.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.520
I think it's positive and will prove to be positive in the long range.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.340
Because a lot of people are being introduced to the imagery of science fiction,

03:36.540 --> 03:38.740
with which they are unfamiliar through these movies.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.400
And now if you look at the evolution in the movies, you find that in the earlier science fiction movies,

03:44.820 --> 03:48.640
if you're going into space or whatever, you had to spend like half an hour setting the thing.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.540
This is a spaceship that takes off from the Earth. People float around it, you know,

03:52.560 --> 03:56.460
and you have to familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar imagery.

03:56.700 --> 04:00.460
Now they can just start a movie bang right off, in a galaxy far away.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.960
Boom. Here's a spaceship in a stromo pow, you know.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.880
In other words, the first half hour of the conventional old-time science fiction movie is gone

04:07.880 --> 04:10.080
because people are now familiar with this imagery.

04:10.880 --> 04:16.160
And I think these movies have brought a lot of new people into familiarity with these images.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.860
They've made these images part of the popular culture.

04:20.100 --> 04:24.680
These movies have mainly aimed at kids and adolescents.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.720
And years from now, assuming that these people ever read anything,

04:29.700 --> 04:34.440
they'll be ready to read science fiction of a more serious kind.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.940
Assuming they're ready to read literature of a more serious kind at all,

04:38.380 --> 04:41.420
because they'll be familiar with the material, familiar with the literature.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.600
It won't seem strange and weird to them because they will have grown up with it.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.100
That's why I think magazines, even magazines like Star-Logs,

04:48.160 --> 04:52.480
in that sense will have a long-term positive impact.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.920

This is David Cruz.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.680
And Daryl Lane.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.060
Norman Spinrad's best-known novel may be Bug Jack Barron,

06:38.260 --> 06:41.080
a book which has stirred controversy in both England and America.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.900
It was published in this country in 1969, and it's a different sort of science fiction novel.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.420
It's a good example of new wave science fiction.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.740
Character and style are important, and it deals with social issues such as racism,

06:52.740 --> 06:56.820
the establishment, drugs, the power of the media, and radical protests.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.980
There is also a good deal of sex and violence in the book, and the language is highly colored.

07:01.340 --> 07:05.240
But Spinrad, thanks to the plot of the book, conforms to traditional science fiction formulas.

07:06.740 --> 07:10.700
Actually, what I was trying to do in a way, the book has a very traditional plot.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.120
As far as I was concerned, it has a positive here, it has a negative here.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.200
The hero wins, the villain loses.

07:17.460 --> 07:22.400
All that stuff that is considered the traditional way of plotting a book,

07:22.400 --> 07:25.220
and yet it's written in a different kind of way.

07:25.420 --> 07:30.840
It kind of takes that superficial kind of plot and treats it in a realistic manner.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.640
The protagonist, Jack Barron, is a powerfully influential television star

07:35.640 --> 07:37.960
who has a talk show watched by 100 million people.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.920
He uses the show as a battlefield to oppose corrupt elements of society.

07:42.340 --> 07:44.460
Spinrad comments on Barron's use of power.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.300
The book is about power.

07:50.340 --> 07:53.200
Power itself is neutral as far as I'm concerned.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.760
That's what people do with it that counts.

07:55.660 --> 08:01.180
Barron is the guy who likes power, he keeps referring to it as a drug,

08:02.180 --> 08:04.340
and knows that he can become addicted to it,

08:05.040 --> 08:07.760
and for that reason, then he decided to stay away from it.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.240
Then he gets drawn back into playing with power because

08:12.080 --> 08:16.020
it comes to the conclusion that it's better for somebody who feels that way about power

08:16.020 --> 08:20.600
to be wielding it than people who don't have any self-consciousness

08:20.600 --> 08:22.320
about the dangers of wielding power.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.520
So in that sense, it's a comment on the power of the media,

08:27.600 --> 08:31.980
but it's also a comment on the morality of power, on the paradox of power,

08:32.060 --> 08:39.880
which is that if you leave power to be wielded by people who do not see the dangers,

08:39.880 --> 08:43.780
the personal dangers, the psychological dangers of being involved with it,

08:44.180 --> 08:46.100
then you end up with people like Benedict Howard,

08:46.280 --> 08:47.880
Sir Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon,

08:49.900 --> 08:53.820
who do not have self-consciousness about the personal dangers,

08:54.020 --> 08:56.980
the moral dangers of chasing after power,

08:57.060 --> 09:01.200
whereas somebody like Barron, who is certainly an imperfect person, as old people are,

09:01.880 --> 09:05.260
at least his saving grace, if he has one,

09:05.260 --> 09:12.480
is that he is well aware of the personal dangers of being involved in a quest for power.

09:13.860 --> 09:16.980
When Spinrad tried to get the novel published in this country, he was unsuccessful,

09:17.360 --> 09:18.180
so he tried and written.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.860
But there was an outcry in Parliament against the book.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.480
He relates the story for us.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.560
That novel, and I'll try, was written on a contract, a double day,

09:26.640 --> 09:27.840
who then rejected it.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.780
As you know, you have to remember, the political climate of the era.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.440
They didn't reject it.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.120
They said, we'll publish it if you cut out all the sex, all the swear words, and all the politics,

09:38.660 --> 09:40.000
which was the whole book.

09:41.260 --> 09:43.660
So it took a long time to resell that book here.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.940
In the meantime, I took it to Milford, to a Milford conference, and Mike Murcock was there,

09:48.980 --> 09:51.340
and he read it, and he locked it, and he serialized it in New World,

09:51.360 --> 09:55.000
so his first publication was actually in England, in the magazine.

09:57.020 --> 10:01.040
Now, halfway through the serialization, I forget exactly which part, part three,

10:01.040 --> 10:04.640
part four, W. H. Smith, which was the biggest distributor,

10:04.660 --> 10:10.300
still is the biggest distributor in England, refused to distribute the magazine because of the book in it.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.520
Now, at that time, New World had an arts council grant,

10:13.880 --> 10:16.220
and the arts council was in the organ of the British government.

10:17.480 --> 10:21.140
Now, the arts council supported the magazine against Smith publicly.

10:22.220 --> 10:27.380
And so the flap in Parliament arose when certain right-wing members of Parliament were aghast

10:27.380 --> 10:32.620
that an organ of the British government, the arts council, was defending this kind of stuff.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.980
And that's how it became a parliamentary issue.

10:37.420 --> 10:41.320
Bugjack Barron is being made into a movie, with a screenplay by Harlan Ellison

10:41.320 --> 10:44.940
and direction by radical filmmaker Costa Gavras. It should be interesting.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.340

This is Daryl Lane.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.160
And David Cruz.

12:27.540 --> 12:32.440
Norman Spinrad's 1979 science fiction novel, A World Between, signaled a change in his fiction.

12:32.440 --> 12:37.940
Spinrad's early work usually contain either subtle or overt criticism of various aspects of society.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.940
Bugjack Barron, the men in the jungle, and agent of chaos are good examples of this type.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.690
A World Between is also a socially oriented novel, but there's a different...

12:58.480 --> 13:00.660
...front element in it. Spinrad explains.

13:01.840 --> 13:14.480
I would say in general that up until, I guess, The World Between really, a lot of my stuff was kind of critical of this,

13:15.060 --> 13:19.660
of critical of existing societies, critical of various things that were going on.

13:20.280 --> 13:25.220
A World Between is meant as a utopian novel, really, in any kind of way.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.320
And it's a prescriptive kind of book.

13:28.080 --> 13:32.820
It's more of a... instead of presenting critical images of other things,

13:33.260 --> 13:38.120
the idea is to create a more positive image of a more positive kind of future.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.860
I think if you spend enough time criticizing what exists,

13:43.240 --> 13:50.460
at some point you have some kind of moral obligation to present something more positive and replace...

13:50.980 --> 13:53.000
...what you find negative.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.500
The setting for the novel is a fit one for a utopia.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.880
It takes place on the planet Pacifica, a beautiful world of blue ocean and lush green islands that's been colonized by humans.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.680
Inhabitants of Pacifica live private lives in their isolated islands.

14:11.260 --> 14:14.760
There are no large urban centers to cause pollution over population or poverty.

14:14.760 --> 14:20.200
Even though they are physically isolated, the Pacificans remain in close electronic contact with one another.

14:20.680 --> 14:26.440
They govern themselves, in fact, with a tight media web that allows them to vote immediately on any issue of importance.

14:26.940 --> 14:30.540
But into this idyllic world comes two opposed political forces from Earth,

14:30.700 --> 14:33.120
bent on the ideological conquest of Pacifica.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.040
One force is the Institute for Transcendental Science,

14:36.480 --> 14:40.380
a powerful organization whose goal is galactic unity under their control.

14:40.380 --> 14:44.140
They are extreme, and Spinrad says they have two basic flaws.

14:45.420 --> 14:50.520
One is the unexamined, subtle male shoveness bias of their culture.

14:51.720 --> 15:01.860
And the other one is the ultimate conviction that what they are doing is the absolute most important thing in the universe,

15:02.080 --> 15:08.960
and that therefore they are morally entitled to run over other people's cultures.

15:08.960 --> 15:20.500
And then, and then this is our, absoluteism I guess would be the, even the kind of theocratic absoluteism would be their, would be their flaws.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.220
The other force is the Femocrats, a militant women's liberation group that is also an extreme.

15:25.800 --> 15:30.600
The struggle of these two groups for control of planets all across the galaxy is called the Pink and Blue War.

15:30.920 --> 15:37.300
It's clearly a male-female conflict, and so far every planet the two sides have approached has ended up on one side or the other.

15:37.300 --> 15:41.700
But Pacifica is different. Spinrad's utopia is a stable and intelligent one.

15:42.220 --> 15:46.640
The Pacificans reject both extremes and even change the minds of a few of the combatants.

15:46.820 --> 15:52.200
We asked Spinrad about reactions to the book. How did women for instance respond to the Femocratic women's livers?

15:53.500 --> 16:01.700
The strange thing about the reaction to that book has been that a certain number of men have, you know,

16:01.700 --> 16:08.760
reacted in a kind of male, male liberal guilt, male feminist kind of reaction against that.

16:09.360 --> 16:14.400
But at most part women have liked the book. Women have identified with it more than men.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.580
And actually I even got one or two good reviews in feminist places.

16:20.340 --> 16:24.200
I think that's not quite what I expected, but that seems to be the way it happened.

16:24.380 --> 16:29.000
I have not gotten a heavy feminist flag from that a little bit, but not much.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.600
Not much, because I think women who are involved in feminism or have been or know women who are,

16:35.400 --> 16:42.240
can recognize a certain aspect of the feminist movement in the Femocrats.

16:42.340 --> 16:46.980
Whereas men who are trying to show how liberator they are would not dream of admitting such a thing.

16:47.640 --> 16:52.440
A world between. A different sort of book for Norman Spinrad, and we'll have more on him tomorrow.

16:59.740 --> 17:05.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:05.720 --> 17:08.740
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:23.220 --> 18:24.920
And here are your hosts.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.440
This is David Cruz. And Daryl Lane.

18:32.740 --> 18:37.900
Norman Spinrad's most recent novel, Songs from the Stars, was published by Simon and Schuster in 1980.

18:38.540 --> 18:42.460
The book describes a fragmented future society in a world devastated by nuclear war.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.780
This, of course, is a typical Spinrad theme.

18:45.360 --> 18:49.280
But the novel also communicates the sense of wonder characteristic of good science fiction,

18:49.500 --> 18:52.680
when it describes the marvels of contact with an alien civilization.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.200
Society has split in two factions in Songs from the Stars.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.800
One faction is an Aquarian society which bans all technology, in fact anything having to do with science,

19:02.280 --> 19:04.940
since this was what was responsible for almost destroying the Earth.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.840
And the other faction are the black scientists who keep technology alive

19:08.840 --> 19:12.660
and maintain an illicit smuggling operation with the Aquarian society.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.040
Spinrad talks about these opposed factions.

19:17.020 --> 19:20.660
It's a book against duality. You have two fragmented societies.

19:20.660 --> 19:27.580
They are both kind of like half societies.

19:27.900 --> 19:38.500
The Aquarian society there is a very nice thing that works, except it really only works because it accepts something from the black scientists,

19:38.820 --> 19:40.780
which it doesn't want to admit that's accepted.

19:41.840 --> 19:51.680
And the black scientists are again another kind of absolutism, which doesn't sell it.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.900
It's a book about horror unity, I guess.

19:58.300 --> 20:02.000
As usual, with Spinrad, the book's conflict reflects current social conditions.

20:02.860 --> 20:05.560
And then you know, a mirror is the present thing in our society.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.720
Where on the one hand you have a great big space movement, people wanting to get into space,

20:11.040 --> 20:12.540
and all the Neil people and all that stuff.

20:12.620 --> 20:18.960
On the other hand you have a real adivistic Neoludite movement, an anti-nuclear movement,

20:19.200 --> 20:22.460
which is really kind of willfully ignorant of a lot of things.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.620
In a way, these are the two things that could bring about the crash.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.220
As well as what with some armaments.

20:34.420 --> 20:40.300
So I think it's basically a book about the grand philosophical attempt at that book,

20:40.300 --> 20:47.500
is to try and bridge the gap between science and reason, and feeling emotion and mysticism.

20:48.600 --> 20:54.040
And to point to a horror unity between the two things,

20:54.040 --> 20:57.540
and a way from the false dichotomies and false dualisms,

20:57.680 --> 21:00.560
which seem to be really destroying Western civilization.

21:00.780 --> 21:06.500
The protagonist in the book is a laid-back Aquarian, clear blue loo.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.620
Along with his girl and a scientist, he travels up to a satellite circling the Earth.

21:11.100 --> 21:15.380
There are the three of them receive communication from some incredibly advanced alien civilizations

21:15.380 --> 21:17.040
in another part of the galaxy.

21:17.560 --> 21:21.960
With the knowledge sent by the helpful aliens, it seems the humans will solve their own problems,

21:21.960 --> 21:25.060
unite, and start progressing toward the stars once more.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.660
We asked Spinrad that if and when we contact an alien civilization,

21:29.060 --> 21:31.480
is it likely they will be helpful rather than hostile?

21:33.320 --> 21:39.600
As I said in the book, I do believe that any civilization that's going to last a million years,

21:39.720 --> 21:43.680
it's going to be a million years or whatever, or even a hundred thousand years more advanced than us,

21:44.100 --> 21:47.480
they've been around that much longer, had that much more advanced science.

21:48.240 --> 21:55.340
If it's going to survive to that length of its own history, it's got to be by that time

21:56.620 --> 22:00.820
philosophically and emotionally pretty together, or will long since have destroyed itself.

22:01.060 --> 22:07.380
I mean, we certainly will not survive a million years of our own history if it continues as it has.

22:08.520 --> 22:12.640
In order that any civilization that survives a million years of its own history

22:12.640 --> 22:18.480
has had to have gotten its political, psychological, and philosophical act together.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.640
And I don't see why...

22:24.140 --> 22:30.320
I do believe that if and when we run into that kind of really advanced civilization,

22:31.440 --> 22:35.820
that they will, if not be directly, actively helpful,

22:35.980 --> 22:40.660
certainly will be benign and will not be interested in either eating us or conquering our planet

22:40.660 --> 22:42.760
or blowing us up or anything like that.

22:43.740 --> 22:49.240
Songs from the Stars is a thoughtfully written book with a theme, but it's also good, exciting science fiction.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.720
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

23:02.720 --> 23:06.000
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:52.780 --> 23:56.280
The following is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.560
Stay with us!

24:13.420 --> 24:18.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.940
And here are your hosts.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.380
This is David Carson.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.240
And Darrell Lane.

24:29.580 --> 24:32.140
James B. Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from Yesteryear,

24:32.620 --> 24:36.320
is a fascinating blend of computers, space exploration, and genetic engineering.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.560
It's about a robot probe that discovers a habitable planet ten light years from Earth,

24:40.820 --> 24:43.580
but it's different than the usual probe imagined by science fiction authors.

24:44.060 --> 24:47.860
Right. This one is equipped to manufacture human beings. Hogan explains.

24:48.880 --> 24:53.440
We read a lot of stories about starships that go on long voyages that take maybe centuries,

24:53.740 --> 24:58.580
and inevitably they've got frozen bodies or bodies in suspended animation or something like that.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.700
But when you think about it, it seems rather an inefficient way to think,

25:03.700 --> 25:08.240
and they're not doing anything. The machines can fly the ship. The computers can get it there.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.780
The people aren't doing anything except just lying there freezing.

25:14.200 --> 25:19.840
So why not let the machines fly the ship and make the people when you get there?

25:20.600 --> 25:27.320
If we look at the progress made in molecular biology and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades,

25:27.320 --> 25:32.900
we already manufactured quite complex organic molecules to specifications,

25:33.300 --> 25:35.080
such as drugs and certain anaesthetics.

25:35.800 --> 25:40.740
If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you couldn't make a complete set of human DNA?

25:41.960 --> 25:47.640
In other words, instead of sending bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

25:47.760 --> 25:56.360
why not just store all the genetic information necessary to make people?

25:57.680 --> 26:06.660
Electronically in the computers and create them when you have found the planet that the instruments say they could survive on.

26:07.300 --> 26:11.280
So the computers make a race of humans, raise them, and place them on the planet.

26:11.780 --> 26:16.300
It sounds a bit mechanical, a little inhuman perhaps, but Hogan thinks it could work out beautifully.

26:16.300 --> 26:28.580
So here's the interesting possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos

26:28.580 --> 26:34.380
that were created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.

26:35.320 --> 26:43.920
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the machines does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.060
It could be quite a charming and amusing one.

26:47.640 --> 27:00.940
The interesting thoughts that the book starts to play with is here is a race of kids that are being raised by some very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities

27:02.080 --> 27:08.280
who don't double talk or deceive or have all these layers of human game playing that we have to contend with.

27:09.760 --> 27:24.780
And they're being raised completely without any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults with their prejudices and hatreds and taboos.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.780
And a lot of the other nonsense is that make life so complicated in our society.

27:30.640 --> 27:35.140
As you might expect, these machine-raised humans are eventually contacted by humans from Earth.

27:35.940 --> 27:39.400
Now let's imagine that a mission from Earth eventually shows up.

27:42.460 --> 27:46.580
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is usually a 20-year voyage, maybe.

27:47.460 --> 27:53.680
So we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people, a space colony with engines.

27:54.360 --> 27:59.370
With its government, its military, its church organizations, its commercial institutions.

28:00.070 --> 28:08.650
The whole of society in miniature with its time-proved mechanisms for controlling and subordinating a population.

28:09.470 --> 28:19.270
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history has imposed itself by restricting the flow of wealth

28:19.270 --> 28:24.130
and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats.

28:25.630 --> 28:32.590
And so what happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race with people-raised people?

28:33.510 --> 28:35.150
And that's really what this story's all about.

28:36.190 --> 28:38.650
Voyage from the Esther Urobe out in paperback at the end of July.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.750
Next week we'll have a series of shows on the works of James B. Hogan.

28:48.170 --> 28:54.150
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:54.390 --> 28:57.290
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
