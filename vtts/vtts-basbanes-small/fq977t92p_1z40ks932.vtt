00:00.689 --> 00:01.630
All right.

00:01.891 --> 00:07.940
One of the questions I had is, first of all, does everything fit in the new house?

00:08.060 --> 00:08.561
It doesn't.

00:09.602 --> 00:16.673
So what I've done is really put the best books in the apartment.

00:16.953 --> 00:21.039
I figured there's room for about 15,000 books, roughly, in the apartment.

00:21.059 --> 00:22.401
Really a fraction of what you had.

00:22.421 --> 00:23.824
Which was a fraction of what I had.

00:23.844 --> 00:30.173
The rest is still in storage, and I'm trying to decide what to do.

00:30.507 --> 00:31.829
about it at this point.

00:33.030 --> 00:43.323
For example, I've taken the authors who I know I want to continue to collect in depth, say Faulkner or Hemingway or Pynchon or whatever.

00:43.704 --> 00:51.874
I have just kept the really primary titles and all the secondary titles I'm going to keep and I'm going to have to keep those in storage.

00:52.073 --> 00:56.518
I'm not going to keep all the authors, I mean all 6,000 authors that I've been collecting.

00:56.558 --> 01:00.101
So the original ambitious premise?

01:00.141 --> 01:00.822
I couldn't handle it.

01:00.982 --> 01:02.323
I couldn't handle it, yeah.

01:02.864 --> 01:04.305
You'd have to feed it in any way.

01:04.406 --> 01:05.266
No, I'm not.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.848
You're being realistic, perhaps.

01:07.028 --> 01:09.030
It's just purely realistic, yeah.

01:09.050 --> 01:15.197
And I suppose if you had unlimited funds and staff to do it, you could keep up.

01:15.217 --> 01:18.520
But otherwise, it's... Well, otherwise it's what?

01:18.837 --> 01:25.067
It's certainly beyond my resources and time capacity.

01:25.087 --> 01:31.617
One of the burning questions I had, because when we were here a year and a half ago, you really weren't doing any, you were in a hiatus.

01:31.697 --> 01:32.879
Right, right, right.

01:32.899 --> 01:36.845
I think part of that had to do with the fact that you didn't have a place to put them.

01:36.865 --> 01:37.747
You didn't enjoy them.

01:37.767 --> 01:38.788
Right, right.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.472
But now we have this wonderful place.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.756
And I will never stop collecting.

01:43.796 --> 01:46.380
I'm just going to be much more selective.

01:47.052 --> 01:50.154
and more careful about it.

01:50.436 --> 01:52.067
So what happens then?
