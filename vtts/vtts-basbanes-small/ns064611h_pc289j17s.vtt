Box says, in Books and Bitters, that had he lived, Harry Widener would have been the greatest book collector the world has ever known.

00:08.567 --> 00:13.272
That's a little press agentry going on there, don't you think, for the benefit of misunderstanding?

00:13.292 --> 00:27.928
Well, that's considering that many, if not most, of the books that were bought were bought after his death because his mother wanted to spend money in his memory.

00:28.567 --> 00:30.750
And she was willing to spend anything.

00:30.770 --> 00:33.414
And she did not want her name tied in with it, did she?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.075
Tied in with it, no.

00:34.416 --> 00:35.437
This was Harry's collection.

00:35.457 --> 00:36.919
This was Harry's collection.

00:36.939 --> 00:39.523
A great collection.

00:39.543 --> 00:39.964
No, it is.

00:39.984 --> 00:40.504
Who knows?

00:40.524 --> 00:42.347
The doctor was the agent for that, too.

00:42.387 --> 00:43.028
Who knows?

00:43.569 --> 00:44.811
It's a great story.

00:44.831 --> 00:45.612
It's a great story.

00:45.632 --> 00:47.354
He was quite a character, by the way.

00:47.374 --> 00:48.596
Rosenbach.

00:49.598 --> 00:51.160
He was more than a bookman, I guess.

00:52.622 --> 00:57.409
Well, let me say this.

00:57.828 --> 01:09.099
I think that Hans Krauss, as an example, was probably a better bookman than the doctor.

01:09.199 --> 01:20.070
I think he may have had a wider, deeper knowledge of not all books, granted, but manuscripts and early books.

01:20.090 --> 01:27.177
But, and so, books at tremendous prices, but

01:27.376 --> 01:31.860
people bought from them, but they didn't like them.

01:32.781 --> 01:33.782
Krauss.

01:33.802 --> 01:34.263
Krauss.

01:35.304 --> 01:41.130
I don't know whether you can get Bill Scheide to talk to you about it.

01:41.150 --> 01:54.683
I'm not going to talk to you about what he told me, but the feeling is, yeah, sure, you buy from Krauss because, by God, he's got the books, but

01:54.950 --> 01:59.297
He isn't the kind of person that you're ever going to be a great friend of.

01:59.838 --> 02:11.959
On the other hand, the people who bought from the doctor, Lessing, Arthur Houghton, the Hydes, Harry Wagner, so forth, were good friends.

02:11.979 --> 02:13.581
Yeah.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.803
Shady, you mentioned Shady.

02:15.024 --> 02:20.012
That is almost unprecedented, where you have three generations of...

02:20.296 --> 02:24.680
Because book collecting really is not normally a hereditary thing.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.243
That's right.
