00:00.655 --> 00:01.716
She's talking to me.

00:02.117 --> 00:05.902
She was one of them, along with Robeson and Joe Lewis and Marian Anderson.

00:06.303 --> 00:09.027
They were the heroes of our day in the 1940s.

00:09.107 --> 00:13.813
I mean, they were the people that black, I mean, most of America point out as role models.

00:13.833 --> 00:21.864
So you can imagine how I felt in meeting my heroes of my childhood, Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson, you know.

00:21.885 --> 00:30.156
And as you know, I just put a record, a poster, I mean, a marker, a historical state marker for Robeson in front of the house that he stayed in.

00:30.592 --> 00:35.257
for 10 years in Philadelphia near the University of Pennsylvania.

00:35.738 --> 00:38.782
So it's like my life has gone full circles, you know.

00:38.842 --> 00:49.314
I'm able to give back to people, to children, and of all races, what these people had provided for me, you know, as a child.

00:49.334 --> 00:50.115
And where did you grow up?

00:50.455 --> 00:53.779
I grew up in Norristown, Pennsylvania, which is 18 miles from Philadelphia, you know.

00:54.179 --> 00:58.084
So I would come down here when I wasn't driving on the

00:58.334 --> 01:02.218
on the train to get the O'Leary's O'Leary.

01:02.338 --> 01:04.040
It's like an L-E-A-R-Y.

01:04.481 --> 01:10.347
We call it the O'Leary Bookstore, and I used to get purchased books that people just discarded.

01:10.367 --> 01:11.168
When you were in high school?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.089
In junior high school.

01:12.269 --> 01:13.010
So you were collecting?

01:13.250 --> 01:13.590
Oh, yeah.

01:13.630 --> 01:18.816
I started out in grade school collecting when I was in the- That store, that's eight years old, right?

01:18.876 --> 01:19.917
Yeah, when I was a kid, yeah.

01:19.937 --> 01:20.698
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:20.718 --> 01:22.680
I became a collector before I knew it.

01:23.100 --> 01:26.704
So I went to salvaging armies and goods will stores and all, but

01:27.022 --> 01:28.464
You know, I went there for another reason.

01:28.784 --> 01:39.075
Before I was the oldest of nine, I mean, at that time we had about a sister and brother, I guess it was about four of us, and eventually, you know, the oldest of nine, I had one brother who died in death.

01:39.095 --> 01:44.861
But nevertheless, we went there for a while, for shoes, for clothes, for furniture.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.824
And of course they had books there.

01:47.864 --> 01:50.447
At the time, when the teacher told me that, I just,

01:50.697 --> 01:54.561
Say for the record, for my typist, and for what the teacher told you.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.224
You're eight years old, and you're in school.

01:57.244 --> 02:01.489
Yeah, in school, and I asked a teacher in an integrated school district.

02:01.529 --> 02:02.150
I never had.

02:02.170 --> 02:03.010
It was in Norristown.

02:03.071 --> 02:07.916
Norristown, Pennsylvania, the same town where Tom Lathorta came from, and so forth.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.237
We called him Mongo.

02:09.437 --> 02:16.045
But nevertheless, growing up in an integrated town on my street, there were Greeks, because you are Greek.

02:16.405 --> 02:20.029
There were Italians, there were Irish, there were Germans.

02:20.380 --> 02:25.965
there was Polish people, so we had a mixture of people at the time.

02:26.045 --> 02:45.642
And most of us was poor as far as wealth, but as far as love and friendship, you know, if one, Mrs. Nellican, the Irish family, her mother was ill, my mother would bring soup or something to them, and the Italian family, so we had this community, you know, the bond.

02:45.662 --> 02:49.425
And as I said, I never had a black teacher in my life.

02:49.895 --> 02:56.044
even at Penn State, due to the fact that the Norristown integration didn't start there as teachers until 1960.

02:56.104 --> 03:00.771
So I asked the teacher, did we have any heroes besides Booker T. Washington?

03:00.811 --> 03:02.333
Did the black people have any heroes?

03:02.454 --> 03:03.175
Yeah, any black people.

03:03.455 --> 03:07.681
She said, no, Charles, Negroes were born to serve white people.

03:07.962 --> 03:11.888
Now, she was a victim of her environment, you know, I mean, although at the time... She said that.

03:11.908 --> 03:13.170
Did you say this in front of the class?

03:13.230 --> 03:15.834
Oh, yes, because it was common.

03:15.854 --> 03:18.197
You know, I mean, we were taught, and she was taught,

03:18.515 --> 03:23.283
She was a victim of her environment, you know, that she was innocent.

03:23.363 --> 03:23.904
I'm sorry.

03:24.586 --> 03:26.148
She's a teacher.

03:26.609 --> 03:27.791
But there are teachers today.

03:28.112 --> 03:30.255
That's why you have all this Afrocentricity.

03:30.496 --> 03:33.000
They're going back to the same stuff they had in 1960.

03:33.261 --> 03:34.443
History pieces.

03:34.463 --> 03:37.869
Remember in 1960, they had the black power movement, integrated schools and all.

03:38.129 --> 03:39.592
The same became blacks.

03:39.612 --> 03:40.794
Now Afrocentricity.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.535
And a lot of people...
