An interest and respect for one another, you know.

00:03.311 --> 00:04.633
How did you feel yesterday?

00:04.693 --> 00:13.403
This won't relate to anything, but how did you feel when you saw all those people walking by the table and handling the Nuremberg Chronicle and these papers?

00:13.423 --> 00:16.506
Well, I was hoping they'd handle it carefully.

00:16.566 --> 00:18.348
Did it upset you?

00:18.368 --> 00:22.753
Did you feel any kind of... No, I wished I could have been over there telling them about it.

00:23.093 --> 00:24.375
What they were.

00:24.455 --> 00:27.338
In fact, that Costanzo book,

00:28.077 --> 00:55.131
isn't an original it's a reprint from the 30s and they've got it miss really the costenza yeah they've got it misidentified yeah i imagine the chrono library knows what it is but that was one of the zamorano 80 books and uh the original that would be very very rare but that was a 1930s reprint it was probably a

00:55.634 --> 00:58.818
privately done thing by Henry R. Wagner.

00:58.838 --> 01:09.910
He was the cartologist and scholar of Spanish Southwest America in his day.

01:09.930 --> 01:17.398
In fact, he wrote a wonderful bibliography called The Spanish Southwest, and he published it in Albuquerque.

01:17.618 --> 01:23.785
It was part of a series of books, The Spanish Southwest, and it was

01:24.558 --> 01:30.105
and is still the bibliography of colonial Southwest America.

01:30.125 --> 01:33.249
But he did some privately printed stuff like that.

01:33.389 --> 01:49.209
One of the things that I've noted, and I've interviewed perhaps 25 really interesting collectors so far, is that inevitably there comes a point where I know that this person knows his books.

01:49.790 --> 01:53.755
And I have to wonder, I mean, when you acquired a book,

01:54.190 --> 01:56.934
I have to believe it didn't go immediately on the shelf.

01:56.954 --> 02:02.562
I mean, you must have read it and devoured it and certainly became intimate with it.

02:02.582 --> 02:06.227
Well, generally I knew about the book before I acquired it.

02:06.748 --> 02:07.048
Really?

02:07.108 --> 02:08.650
I knew its significance.

02:08.911 --> 02:14.859
Whether it was in a library or in a junk store at the bottom of a box, I knew it instantly.

02:14.879 --> 02:16.021
So how did you find out about it?

02:16.201 --> 02:19.185
I read it before you went to acquire it.

02:19.503 --> 02:20.867
Oh, I read, I knew.

02:20.928 --> 02:21.269
You knew?

02:21.289 --> 02:23.275
You know, I knew bibliographies.

02:23.295 --> 02:25.583
So you had a want list?

02:25.683 --> 02:26.706
In my head.

02:26.807 --> 02:27.830
Uh-huh.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.880
Yeah, some things I'd write down, very little I would, but I'd know.
