00:00.706 --> 00:15.828
It fits into that period in the 19th century where you had major magazines like Century and Harper's and so forth, where these things were serialized, good illustrators were employed to illustrate them.

00:17.831 --> 00:23.099
But the important thing I was going to mention is that Stockton was a prolific correspondent.

00:25.643 --> 00:30.510
So I said to some surviving members of the Stockton family once, well,

00:31.351 --> 00:36.337
Gosh, aren't there a lot of letters to Frank Stockton?

00:36.357 --> 00:39.521
Oh, yes, they said, there was a trunk or two full of them.

00:41.003 --> 00:45.809
But at the end of World War I, we got so tired of carrying them around, we burnt them.

00:47.792 --> 00:51.737
I said, well, weren't there letters from people like Mark Twain?

00:52.257 --> 00:56.683
Oh, yes, they said, we remember those because we cut the autographs off before we burnt the letters.

00:58.013 --> 01:07.263
So that half of the correspondence, except for about twenty-one letters that I got from another member of the Stockton family who gave them to me, are gone.

01:07.303 --> 01:09.545
What do you feel when you hear something like that?

01:11.027 --> 01:13.549
Well, you just lost another friend, that's all.

01:14.730 --> 01:27.784
Well, the point of talking about the Stockton collection, and the fact is my father's library door was always open to me, because he saw that I knew how to handle books.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.740
He liked to be in the library.

01:31.522 --> 01:39.531
And on my 21st birthday, he also saw that I was pretty well hooked in the rare book and the things.

01:39.551 --> 01:42.434
He said, well, son, you don't need another car.

01:43.536 --> 01:47.340
I'll give you the library for your 21st birthday, and here it is.

01:49.462 --> 01:50.924
So... The whole library?

01:50.964 --> 01:52.866
The whole library.

01:52.886 --> 01:53.667
The whole library.

01:53.707 --> 01:55.529
That must have knocked you in your butt.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.191
I think it might have been something.

01:57.211 --> 01:57.872
Surprised.

01:58.392 --> 02:00.073
Well, how did you—what was your reaction?

02:00.594 --> 02:01.395
Thank you very much.

02:02.976 --> 02:03.636
I was grateful.

02:05.878 --> 02:12.664
And it just doubled my own load of— But it's a pretty resonant gift, isn't it?

02:12.684 --> 02:12.804
Yeah.

02:12.824 --> 02:18.909
I mean, it's something that has— Yeah, I mean, you know— It's resonating over 50 years, let's put it that way.

02:18.929 --> 02:21.752
You lived, uh, lived with it at that time.

02:21.832 --> 02:25.475
I'd lived with it for 21 years.

02:27.436 --> 02:28.197
But, uh,

02:30.640 --> 02:31.872
It was a shocker really.

02:32.599 --> 02:34.255
Well, did it?
