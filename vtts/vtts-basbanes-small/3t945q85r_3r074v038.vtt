00:02.579 --> 00:04.202
Did you have any remorse at all?

00:04.222 --> 00:09.510
Did you feel that you were taking something valuable from somebody else?

00:09.530 --> 00:13.878
Yeah, I felt if there were somebody else, I did have quite a bit of remorse.

00:13.898 --> 00:26.779
I felt if there was somebody else just like me, who maybe would have been unknown, but yet would have had the insight into finding these materials, they wouldn't be there for them.

00:26.799 --> 00:28.722
And I felt I had to get these

00:30.085 --> 00:57.713
back or to be made accessible to other people in some way, you know, so then. How would you have done that in your own mind, in other words? Well I was going to bestow the knowledge to as many people as I can or have people in see him while I was alive and I was gonna. How are you gonna do that? Well when I died, I was going to leave it my will, a confession. Really? And a trust to do this. That's why I say I'm sort of living my death you know. I thought of this for hours and hours and days.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.707
How did you enjoy your collection?

01:08.489 --> 01:11.255
I saw some photos in the file of the collection.

01:11.335 --> 01:16.146
Mostly bringing people up to see it, like I'm showing you my house or someone.

01:16.206 --> 01:20.916
You're going to see the skeleton of my life, you know.

01:21.301 --> 01:22.442
The empty shell.

01:22.502 --> 01:24.805
When's the last time you were down here?

01:24.825 --> 01:25.586
A week ago.

01:25.646 --> 01:33.255
This is probably going to be the last time I'm going to be able to come here, because I'm gone for an extended period of time.

01:33.475 --> 01:34.997
The house will probably, Mr. Hall will die.

01:35.017 --> 01:36.459
I'll call in the disrepair.

01:37.300 --> 01:40.784
Maybe get torn down for a parking lot, the ever classic.

01:40.804 --> 01:43.447
Now, I understand your father's coming in.

01:43.467 --> 01:44.228
Today, yeah.

01:44.248 --> 01:45.089
Testifying.

01:45.109 --> 01:46.811
Did he know about your collecting?

01:46.831 --> 01:50.295
Well, he knew, yeah, I knew about the collecting.

01:50.562 --> 01:55.028
He thinks it's an obsession, but no, he didn't know about any of the other stuff.

01:55.108 --> 01:56.911
Any of the means, shall we say.

01:56.971 --> 02:01.778
Of course, I spent an awful lot of money on the majority of the stuff I bought.

02:01.898 --> 02:05.623
Yeah, I think that's a point that hasn't come out, you know, and I'd like to make that.

02:06.725 --> 02:07.947
I would like to ask you that.

02:07.987 --> 02:13.735
They say they recovered in excess of 20,000 books and magazines.

02:15.352 --> 02:24.223
But they haven't distinguished between how many were purchased legitimately by yourself and those obtained otherwise.

02:24.243 --> 02:29.549
And as you know, in the antiquarian market, there's a lot of ex-library stuff out there.

02:29.629 --> 02:30.130
Ex-librous stuff.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.051
Ex-librous, yeah.

02:31.491 --> 02:33.113
A lot of phones.

02:33.133 --> 02:33.574
That's right.

02:33.614 --> 02:34.415
So give me an idea.

02:34.435 --> 02:35.476
Give me an idea of the numbers.

02:35.837 --> 02:36.878
Well go in any bookstore.

02:36.898 --> 02:37.559
Well, it depends.

02:37.819 --> 02:42.264
I mean, in your collection, the numbers that were purchased would fit.

02:42.284 --> 02:42.945
Acquired.

02:43.195 --> 02:53.349
You know, since these moves out of Elliott Avenue, I haven't gotten my whole collection out.

02:53.449 --> 03:04.764
And most of the stuff that, the earlier stuff that I acquired, hadn't been unpacked yet.

03:04.804 --> 03:06.386
Now, did they?

03:06.406 --> 03:10.251
Oh, I'd say easily 50% or even more.

03:10.392 --> 03:12.274
How much would you say you spent?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.703
Over the years, I'm book collecting.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.327
Did you get a rough idea?

03:18.347 --> 03:19.168
$100,000.

03:20.850 --> 03:23.092
I bought and bought.

03:23.112 --> 03:26.616
It adds up, you know, $20 here, $30 there.

03:27.758 --> 03:30.020
Did you ever go hungry?

03:30.060 --> 03:31.963
Would you choose to have a book or a meal?

03:31.983 --> 03:34.145
Oh, I'd have read every book.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.568
Any day of the year.

03:36.848 --> 03:39.932
With the record, Joe, he's smiling broadly at that question.
