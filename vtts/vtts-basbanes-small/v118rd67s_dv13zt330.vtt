00:00.537 --> 00:02.900
I'm going to ask you one question.

00:02.940 --> 00:05.042
I'm going to try and catch a 5 o'clock plane.

00:05.062 --> 00:07.364
I see the 5 o'clock and 9 o'clock.

00:07.505 --> 00:08.986
I think I'll grab the 5.

00:09.807 --> 00:14.892
And this came to me this morning at 5.15 or so.

00:14.953 --> 00:16.434
I was driving to the airport.

00:16.454 --> 00:26.425
But do you think that there is such a thing as bibliomania on the institutional level?

00:26.445 --> 00:28.367
And I wonder if Texas is an example of that.

00:29.647 --> 00:34.435
Certainly, Texas has been biblio-maniacal.

00:37.942 --> 00:44.593
When you talk about having X number of Lady Chatterly's Lover, there is no sense to that.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.539
Now, I have to say, that's going too far as opposed to it.

00:47.559 --> 00:48.060
No, no.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.422
There could be a sense to it.

00:50.303 --> 00:54.591
The idea of the fact that there might have been textual changes.

00:55.010 --> 00:58.153
If that's the case, but it probably isn't.

00:58.173 --> 01:02.778
And also, this is the copy that was owned by Lady Adeline Morrell.

01:02.818 --> 01:06.743
That's an entirely different argument.

01:06.763 --> 01:24.021
But if they are acquiring this title to get as many copies of the first printing as they can, I just don't... Well, bibliomania is subject to many different definitions and interpretations.

01:24.575 --> 01:25.055
Oh.

01:30.380 --> 01:34.984
But I think that it's not necessarily a bad thing.

01:35.945 --> 01:37.707
Do you think bibliomania is that?

01:37.727 --> 01:39.829
Well, the title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

01:40.169 --> 01:50.999
Well, I think there has to be a certain— I'm one myself, you know, and I confess it's like, you know, alcoholics in the office, I suppose.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.362
Yeah, there has to be a certain amount of madness.

01:54.798 --> 02:09.098
for an institution to buy things that they have really no guarantee are going to be relevant to research or .

02:09.118 --> 02:10.760
It's a gut feeling.

02:10.780 --> 02:23.337
It is a— Well, what motivates somebody or some place to go crazy—well, that's a wrong, that's an incorrect word, but—to do things.

02:24.143 --> 02:27.949
to acquire books that you would never do for anything else.

02:28.269 --> 02:32.576
I mean, you know, you'd go out to the dinner, and you'd say, geez, a hundred bucks or something for dinner.

02:32.996 --> 02:41.149
No big deal, but, you know, you'd spend $500 for this John Cheever, John Cheever's first book, which comes to mind, $600.

02:41.289 --> 02:47.879
Oh, it's wonderful, you know, mint, dust jacket, and without even breaking Sprite, you know, send it to me.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.087
I can't speak to the motivation of individual book collectors.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.166
I have to have it.

02:56.186 --> 02:59.050
That's the phrase you hear all the time, I have to have it.

02:59.070 --> 03:02.535
I can't speak to that because I'm not bitten by that bug.

03:02.555 --> 03:05.320
I don't mind it in other people.

03:06.161 --> 03:09.105
It must amuse you to see it too.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.988
I appreciate it in other people.

03:11.008 --> 03:14.453
They have the money and that's fine.

03:15.094 --> 03:23.547
But I think that most collections that I have dealt with are dealing, institutional collections, are dealing more with research.

03:23.780 --> 03:26.490
for public education.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.564
Texas is by no means alone, by the way, in this.

03:30.584 --> 03:34.498
I mean, the Lilly Library in Bloomington, the University of Illinois.
