00:00.301 --> 00:02.464
I never heard Jackson tell it.

00:02.484 --> 00:06.348
I forget how I discovered it, but that was part of my introduction to Taylor.

00:06.548 --> 00:12.836
But let's throw that out as a... How do you feel about that?

00:12.856 --> 00:28.975
If that, in fact, without using that as a general policy, if you have a perfect copy of the book, of an exceedingly scarce book, how do you feel about this thought that perhaps it shouldn't be in an institution, that perhaps it should be in the hands of a private collector?

00:29.478 --> 00:48.644
Well, I suppose that if we were talking a generation ago, we would say that private collectors are able to pass on books of that sort, maybe great bookbinders, or fragile, modern books, books of the past 150 years, in pristine condition, because they don't.

00:49.765 --> 00:58.757
Collectors tend not to use their books, but to handle them with great care, to make protective cases, and they've done that for 100 years.

00:58.777 --> 00:59.198
Now,

00:59.566 --> 01:15.869
perhaps it's part of our responsibility in institutions to not only serve readers with microfilms and books that get copied and with books that get used up.

01:16.169 --> 01:29.067
Just think of the undergraduate using up copy after copy after copy of standard text and reference books, which we replace with other, not only to do that, but perhaps to take very good care

01:29.637 --> 01:37.668
of some great historical documents in manuscript or printed form.

01:37.708 --> 01:47.762
We showed in bibliography class a week or two ago a perfect Elizabethan quarto, untrimmed.

01:49.604 --> 01:58.176
We were talking about formats, size of the sheet, size of the book, and we wanted to make the point about what that looked like

01:59.354 --> 02:01.136
So we didn't open it, even.

02:01.336 --> 02:06.041
We showed it as a closed pamphlet, full-sized, untrimmed.

02:07.282 --> 02:11.006
And that exists here for that purpose.

02:11.026 --> 02:16.011
Not to be read, not to be micro-focused, but just for that purpose.

02:16.031 --> 02:24.940
And there may be an increasing number of books like that, which we will have to designate for that purpose.

02:29.155 --> 02:34.461
book here and part of it has been for years.

02:34.481 --> 02:38.807
Because we know that those books have a limited life.

02:38.827 --> 02:43.272
There's so many times you open the fragile leaves and they break.

02:43.793 --> 02:48.198
You can almost make the comparison with how often you show watercolors in the museum.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.319
It's the same thing.

02:49.339 --> 02:51.602
There's only so many looks in the same thing.

02:52.724 --> 02:53.965
You go to the Portland Art Museum
