00:01.660 --> 00:06.180
Roger, would you give us a little bit of background, kind of how you grew up and how you got interested

00:06.180 --> 00:07.400
initially in science fiction?

00:07.960 --> 00:10.280
How I grew up, while I was first born.

00:12.040 --> 00:18.640
Yes, my father had been interested in science fiction from the days of Gernsback with amazing

00:18.640 --> 00:19.200
stories.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.820
And one of the first presents that I got that I remember getting was a complete set at the

00:26.820 --> 00:29.120
time of the old Ace Double novels.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.740
Golly, I must have been seven or eight years old at the time.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.300
And I read those abadly and then I went on to other things.

00:36.540 --> 00:42.860
I went on to Childhoods End by Arthur C. Clark and a Mirror for Observers by Edgar Pangborn.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.620
And I really liked it.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.480
In fact, I like both of them.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.620
And I like science fiction so much that I tended to read science fiction in those years

00:53.280 --> 00:54.660
and not other types of fiction.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.140
Other people may have been reading Tarzan or whatever.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.060
But I would read only science fiction, principally science fiction by Poole Anderson as I mentioned

01:02.060 --> 01:04.860
off of C. Clark and so on.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.040
And I just grew to love it.

01:06.820 --> 01:11.700
I think I still have a list somewhere of every science fiction book that I read during my

01:11.700 --> 01:12.280
teen years.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.620
And then I think I was in my early 20s when I got the idea after reading some anthologies

01:17.620 --> 01:18.700
that maybe I could do.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.980
An anthology possibly as good as anybody else.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.600
So the first couple that I got together from magazines clipping a story here, that I liked

01:27.600 --> 01:30.040
the story there, the first couple were rejected.

01:30.540 --> 01:37.300
And then I met Sam Moskowitz and he and I did an anthology together called Alien Worlds

01:37.300 --> 01:38.680
for Paperback Library.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.520
That did well in fact.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.520
And they signed a second anthology entitled Invasion of the Robots.

01:45.220 --> 01:49.680
Neither of those two built Sam's name directly.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.080
And apparently if I remember correctly that's the way he wanted it.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.500
But subsequent to those two, Sam and I went on to do several directly.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.880
Then I worked with a fine gentleman named Dick Gadaia who is now director of publicity for

02:03.880 --> 02:05.320
ABC Television in New York.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.120
We did all three or four possibly as many as five together.

02:09.120 --> 02:16.020
And if I remember correctly all of those anthologies were of reprinted material.

02:16.420 --> 02:23.640
I started to branch out on my own doing anthologies on a solo basis principally commissioning

02:23.640 --> 02:27.460
original stories by well-known authors and beginning authors.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.600
And I as it turned out could have access to the authors directly perhaps a little more

02:32.600 --> 02:34.500
than Sam or Vic did.

02:34.620 --> 02:38.420
So we didn't part company so much in a very unfriendly way.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.240
We parted company in a friendly way.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.420
We went off in different directions.

02:42.780 --> 02:51.400
And I don't accept for epoch with Bob Silverberg and spine chillers for double day with Howard

02:51.400 --> 02:52.080
Goldsmith.

02:52.660 --> 02:57.760
I don't believe, oh yes, in saving worlds with Virginia Kidd.

02:58.600 --> 03:03.520
I have not done any anthologies with those three exceptions with anybody else.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.640
I've worked principally on a solo editor basis for ten years now.

03:09.360 --> 03:16.940
And in that period of ten years, oh, including novels, collections, one author, collections

03:16.940 --> 03:19.460
and anthologies I've done over a hundred books.

03:22.620 --> 03:29.220
The main reason I wanted to talk to you is that you have been a very prolific editor

03:29.220 --> 03:36.260
and I wanted to take the chance to explore how one sets up an anthology.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.780
How do you get the idea?

03:37.980 --> 03:39.620
Of course you can't answer how you get the idea.

03:39.940 --> 03:45.160
But how the idea gestates and then how you approach publishers with the idea, how you

03:45.160 --> 03:46.320
line the stories, that sort of thing.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.480
Could you give us a sketch of how that's done?

03:48.660 --> 03:52.760
Let me use an anthology entitled Future City.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.300
I originally did it for Trident Press, which was a division assignment at Houston.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.500
Then it went into paperback through pocketbooks.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.380
I got to know the editor there at the time, Bernard Shirkliffe, who I believe is now with

04:05.380 --> 04:06.520
Warner paperback books.

04:07.640 --> 04:13.840
I said to Bernie, and by that time I had built up a credit list of enough reprint and a few

04:14.820 --> 04:18.240
isolated original anthologies that I could send him some of these examples.

04:18.940 --> 04:23.580
And he liked what he saw and he said, well, what would you like to do?

04:23.580 --> 04:26.880
He said, are there themes that we'd like to cover, urban development or whatever?

04:27.240 --> 04:32.860
And I said, well, why don't we do an anthology based upon the theme of the city of the future

04:32.860 --> 04:35.900
and what the destiny of the city is going to be?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.300
And he liked it and I sent him a page or two proposal.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.980
We talked a couple more times by phone and to my surprise and pleasure they sent me a

04:45.600 --> 04:46.480
good contract.

04:46.700 --> 04:52.080
And then as I started to develop the anthology, so most original anthologies, even around

04:52.080 --> 04:55.440
a theme, are somewhat hodgepodgey.

04:55.880 --> 05:01.240
And as good as Epoch was, maybe, which I did with Bob Silverberg, it still is a collection

05:01.860 --> 05:06.420
of diverse stories by diverse writers on a variety of themes.

05:06.780 --> 05:12.600
And I wanted future cities, I got into it to have a central cohesion that you don't

05:12.600 --> 05:14.580
always find even in themed anthologies.

05:14.840 --> 05:23.200
So what we did was I designed it as though, in a sense, it were a kind of episodic novel

05:23.980 --> 05:26.100
written by 15 or 20 different people.

05:26.220 --> 05:29.640
Each chapter was a story written by 15 or 20 different people.

05:29.960 --> 05:38.780
And as the anthology started out, the story or stories were reasonably optimistic or at

05:38.780 --> 05:40.260
least not unduly negative.

05:40.780 --> 05:47.260
And then as the anthology progressed, we have a chronological and psychological dissipation,

05:47.320 --> 05:47.800
if you will.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.600
And the stories became increasingly pessimistic.

05:52.200 --> 05:57.060
And the last story involves the world blowing up and all cities going into dust.

05:57.500 --> 06:04.180
So we start out optimistically, progressed to martyrily pessimistic, progressed to a story

06:04.180 --> 06:05.460
which ended with no hope.

06:05.460 --> 06:11.120
And so there you have a cohesion that just most anthologies original or otherwise do not

06:11.120 --> 06:11.440
have.

06:11.640 --> 06:18.460
And it was a lot more fun to do and more artistically challenging because you're handing out assignments

06:18.460 --> 06:21.500
as it were to 15, 20 authors.

06:22.380 --> 06:28.500
And how much do you guide the author in terms of having the author fit the story into where

06:28.500 --> 06:30.800
that story would fit in the anthology?

06:31.240 --> 06:35.120
And of course, I got in a number of stories.

06:35.860 --> 06:40.260
At that time, I got in hundreds of stories on an unsolicited basis.

06:40.540 --> 06:44.160
And for this anthology, one or two or three were quite good.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.440
And there I had the luxury of reading the story first and finding out where it fit.

06:49.760 --> 06:56.000
But normally with original, all new anthologies where you assign the stories, it's a little

06:56.000 --> 06:56.420
difficult.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.420
So there was a little bit of trial and error.

06:58.420 --> 07:04.360
But Ted Sturgeon did a review, I believe it was for amazing stories, I could be wrong,

07:04.740 --> 07:08.860
in which he said that this was probably one of the best, if not the best anthology that

07:08.860 --> 07:09.700
I had ever done.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.780
But of course, I don't necessarily do an anthology.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.440
I do a novel because I am the one person writing that book.

07:18.640 --> 07:25.880
But I'm simply in effect a kind of hub of the wheel and the writers are the spokes and

07:25.880 --> 07:28.900
it all works together because we're working in it together.

07:29.120 --> 07:34.320
So I consider Future City to be really a terrific book.

07:34.400 --> 07:39.560
And I'd say that without ego, because I was only in a sense, a minor part of it, the writers

07:39.560 --> 07:39.940
wrote it.

07:41.980 --> 07:50.020
And that book also included poems and included some extremely outspoken stories, some extremely

07:50.020 --> 07:51.060
violent stories.

07:51.060 --> 07:58.640
And so there was a good cross section of styles, but chronologically and psychologically, the

07:58.640 --> 08:05.840
anthology assumes that the city is a dead quote thing, unquote, and the stories proceeded

08:05.840 --> 08:07.320
to out of that viewpoint.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.780
You mentioned that one way you can look at this is as a novel.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.520
Did you, have you ever attempted to write stories yourself or still plan to?

08:19.520 --> 08:26.400
Oh, I sold a story to Bob Silverberg for New Dimension Spore.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.000
It's interesting.

08:29.900 --> 08:36.360
It's so totally avant-garde with sentence structure and the way the type is set on the

08:36.360 --> 08:36.780
stage.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.480
It's rather bizarre.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.140
I was somewhat influenced by so many stories that I bought from Barry Malisberg.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.700
I think I, and Barry claims that I bought more stories from him than any other editor,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.320
more wordage, including novels.

08:50.140 --> 08:55.980
And his stories tend to be often bizarre in the best sense of the term as a Picasso painting

08:55.980 --> 09:00.520
might be considered bizarre if compared with another painter's more traditional work.

09:00.840 --> 09:06.340
So this story was totally different from what people had expected of me and from me, and

09:06.340 --> 09:08.780
it got a lot of good recognition.

09:09.080 --> 09:15.640
And then I did several stories for my own anthologies, which is not as nepotistic or

09:15.640 --> 09:20.040
incestuous as you might think, because what I did was I would send the story that I had

09:20.040 --> 09:24.280
written to the publisher and said, look, is this good enough to include?

09:24.800 --> 09:28.560
If it isn't, I don't think either of it should touch it with the proverbial ten foot pole.

09:29.860 --> 09:34.940
And in three or four cases where I did stories from my own anthologies, the publisher said,

09:35.040 --> 09:36.600
fine, let's use it.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.540
So I did use it.

09:37.880 --> 09:45.440
But as far as my own writing now, I'm principally writing nonfiction, and that nonfiction is

09:45.440 --> 09:53.680
principally comprised of interviews with TV and movie stars, with politicians, with,

09:53.860 --> 09:58.720
for example, in October, I'm going to England and I'm going to be interviewing Sir John

09:58.720 --> 10:06.060
Gil Good, Sir Ralph Richardson, Sir Lawrence Olivier, and so on, people of that caliber

10:06.060 --> 10:07.700
and quality in the acting field.

10:08.480 --> 10:13.960
And so most of my writing is in the area of personality profiling slash interviewing.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.460
I'm presently editor-in-chief of a new national magazine.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.280
I don't want this to be a commercial, but I'm trying to ask your question in terms of

10:21.280 --> 10:22.100
my own writing now.

10:22.740 --> 10:27.800
I'm editor-in-chief of a new national magazine entitled Person to Person, which the publisher

10:27.800 --> 10:30.020
is bringing out to compete with people.

10:30.700 --> 10:37.320
And the sole reason for that magazine's existence is over the past 21 years that I've been interviewing

10:37.320 --> 10:41.860
people, and I started interviewing celebrities, if you will, long before I got into science

10:41.860 --> 10:45.700
fiction and have now continued with it, now that I'm principally out of science fiction.

10:46.180 --> 10:53.180
The magazine, the litany of complaints that I've heard over the last 20, 21 years has

10:53.960 --> 10:55.480
been really pretty bad.

10:55.940 --> 11:02.620
The average journalist may well consider the average celebrity to be fair game, and so many

11:02.620 --> 11:07.720
magazines, even others which should not be named for print or for telecast or broadcast,

11:08.210 --> 11:16.540
other magazines do not have an unbending philosophy of editorial integrity.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.700
They feel it is all right to apparently misquote a star.

11:21.260 --> 11:28.760
They feel it is all right to tack on a scandal-ridden, misleading headline, and Person to Person

11:28.760 --> 11:33.520
is geared toward real integrity and journalism, checking material through a star.

11:33.940 --> 11:41.000
And this leads to the point that I am writing a bulk of all the material that appears, at

11:41.000 --> 11:46.240
least in the first several issues of Person to Person, because I'm rather pink-headed

11:46.240 --> 11:47.380
about how it should be done.

11:47.440 --> 11:53.380
I feel the style should be of a certain type, the depth, if you will, the interview should

11:53.380 --> 11:58.560
be always consistent, little of anything that is superficial.

11:59.300 --> 12:03.080
I'm writing, oh, golly, 64-page magazine.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.240
I must be writing 40 to 45 pages of it.

12:06.540 --> 12:11.500
Other writers include Armie Archard, who is a columnist for Daily Variety, and interviews

12:11.500 --> 12:15.660
a number of the film stars prior to the Academy Awards broadcast each year.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.140
So I'm doing that writing.

12:17.680 --> 12:23.660
Four years ago I wrote a novel, rather like, oh, I guess you could say, in the Jonathan

12:23.660 --> 12:26.800
Livingston Seagull genre, and that was called Soaring.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.340
That was strictly a work of fiction.

12:28.800 --> 12:35.280
I've written biographies of Nancy Reagan for Simon and Schuster back in 76, biographies

12:35.280 --> 12:41.560
of Pat and Shirley Boone, collections of interviews that I've done, and I'm also getting into,

12:42.500 --> 12:46.980
I hope, pretty fair novelizations of different TV shows.

12:47.100 --> 12:53.200
I just finished something based upon the spin-off of Happy Days, Journey Love to Chauchy.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.260
I'm finishing now a Facts of Life novelization.

12:58.020 --> 13:06.060
I've also done tie-ins, although not novelizations, with Dukes of Hazard and Fantasy Island and so on.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.820
Sounds like you don't get bored.

13:10.420 --> 13:15.120
I don't, and I'll tell you, I'm also, and I can't name them yet, I've just been appointed,

13:15.660 --> 13:17.280
and I hope I'm using the right title.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.320
If it's inaccurate, don't kill me, but it amounts to the same thing in any event.

13:22.680 --> 13:28.100
Entertainment editor for one of the oldest newspaper syndication services in the country,

13:28.580 --> 13:32.740
beginning in a month or two, and I have the contract literally here, and I'm signing it this weekend.

13:34.400 --> 13:40.900
By September, October, we're going to be putting together a packet of entertainment-oriented

13:40.900 --> 13:48.680
materials, columns, articles, etc., and sending that to subscribing newspapers around the country,

13:49.040 --> 13:55.180
with the notion that if you buy this packet, you don't have to buy a column from this service,

13:55.340 --> 13:55.880
this from another.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.000
It's going to be a complete entertainment package.

13:58.220 --> 14:04.240
It's going to be called person to person, and once again, it's going to have the editorial philosophy

14:04.240 --> 14:06.580
that every word is true.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.680
Every fact is accurate.

14:09.680 --> 14:15.420
If there is something terribly outspoken in it, it's not something that we have made up.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.220
It's something the celebrity has chosen to give.

14:19.580 --> 14:26.420
For example, Linda Blair, who was in the Exorcist and the sequel and a number of other films,

14:27.120 --> 14:35.700
years, some years ago, developed a problem with drugs, and that somewhat hampered her career,

14:35.700 --> 14:38.160
and she's making a comeback now.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.640
She has never talked about this in-depth before.

14:41.140 --> 14:47.780
So what we're going to be doing is an interview, which I'll be conducting with Linda, perceptively, lovingly,

14:48.420 --> 14:56.940
and hopefully with some attempt to show how she got into this and why she's glad she's out.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.700
In other words, an attempt to do something, hopefully at the depth and the length of a Playboy interview,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.140
and she has never talked about that before.

15:04.140 --> 15:11.640
I would intend it as a kind of message to young people around the country as to the problems of getting involved with drugs.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.440
Was science fiction then just a phase that you passed through?

15:18.760 --> 15:21.380
It was a really long phase. It lasted for ten years.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.400
Was it a good...

15:23.400 --> 15:31.640
Is a phase something that is ten years, a decade long, or is a phase some transitory thing?

15:31.640 --> 15:39.120
I think of a phase as something somebody gets into for a year or two or maybe three, probably never four.

15:39.540 --> 15:47.860
With me, it lasted, if you will, ten years, rather than a phase which involves a mental image of something maybe capricious.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.260
I would say it was a period in my career, not a phase.

15:53.860 --> 16:01.040
Let me, if I can, go back in those days then and ask a couple more questions about being an editor.

16:01.680 --> 16:08.180
When you were editing science fiction anthologies, what kind of audience did you aim for?

16:08.300 --> 16:15.120
Were you trying to please yourself or some commercial stereotype that... or whatever you could aim for?

16:15.120 --> 16:24.360
Well, basically, although some people can fought my judgment, or Bob Silverberg, or Harlan Ellison's, or whoever,

16:24.880 --> 16:29.020
I basically bought stories that I liked.

16:29.920 --> 16:39.380
I basically bought stories that I felt, in some cases, even if I didn't particularly like them,

16:39.380 --> 16:48.860
if they were well written, if they had something to say, if they were something that obviously the author felt sincerely.

16:50.000 --> 17:04.480
I bought it anyway. I bought some stories that I felt were personally, religiously, morally, or whatever, offensive, because I felt they said something worthwhile.

17:11.940 --> 17:17.180
You apparently really got to know the writers, and I gather from what you were telling me about what you're doing now,

17:17.280 --> 17:24.560
you apparently have a talent for acquiring a relationship with a lot of people.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.200
I would assume...

17:26.200 --> 17:26.720
Can I interrupt?

17:26.940 --> 17:27.140
Sure.

17:27.300 --> 17:31.120
Let me use a different word. You don't acquire a relationship.

17:31.440 --> 17:31.720
Right.

17:32.060 --> 17:35.780
Because that implies that you're looking to acquire a relationship.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.160
Right.

17:36.560 --> 17:44.260
And if one acquires a relationship, one begins to think of relationships as acquiring a prize, or trophy, or something.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.160
What? Well taken.

17:45.500 --> 18:04.620
I think relationships develop, and what I would say is I am interested in relationships developing beyond purely the professional slash commercial implications.

18:05.780 --> 18:11.980
I.e., I will interview Star, X, Y, or Z. The interview goes very well.

18:12.480 --> 18:17.600
The Star will say, give me a bus. We'll have lunch next week. I'll get the Star a bus. We have lunch next week.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.080
The Star will say, hey, I'd like to get a friend of mine. Boom, boom, boom.

18:21.420 --> 18:29.640
So it leads into that. So that you do not, rather, I enjoy what I'm doing only superficially because of the money,

18:29.640 --> 18:34.980
and only superficially because of the recognition it really is coming quite heavily now.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.200
I enjoy what I'm doing because of people.

18:38.860 --> 18:49.280
One mistake that I made in science fiction, which I am doing anything but making now, is that I conducted so much of my business by phone.

18:50.380 --> 18:56.700
And this man back in New Jersey was always making phone calls and doing this and that.

18:56.820 --> 19:10.980
I was like the unseen entrepreneur, if you will, in the field, and people that didn't meet me tended to wonder what I was like,

19:11.160 --> 19:14.920
and in some cases, not like what they felt I was like.

19:14.920 --> 19:23.260
And however, when you meet people, they will obviously possibly dislike you. On the other hand, they may like you.

19:23.680 --> 19:30.280
And so I feel if I had anything at all to do over in the science fiction field, I would have gone to conventions.

19:31.120 --> 19:38.580
I would have had parties of my own. I would have gotten out there more and mixed with people.

19:39.420 --> 19:46.420
Recently, I became involved with Disney Studios in attending the science fiction convention scene,

19:46.520 --> 19:51.980
and the comic book scene representing them and doing some preparatory work in terms of publicizing Tron.

19:53.140 --> 19:58.420
It was like night and day. Even some authors, three or four, that I met at these conventions,

19:58.420 --> 20:07.400
with whom I had had sometimes vehement arguments over the phone, really boisterous, name-calling bad language,

20:07.820 --> 20:13.720
on their part at least, and I try not to fall into bad language, but I'm sure I even slipped too.

20:14.040 --> 20:19.720
And these are really horrendous arguments. I meet these same people in person. We end up shaking hands.

20:19.860 --> 20:23.800
I even threw a pie in one of their faces. Now that, let me explain that.

20:23.800 --> 20:30.980
There was a Stump the Experts panel at one of the conventions, and I am kind of a movie trivia nut.

20:31.360 --> 20:36.300
So the idea is you're supposed to ask one of the experts a question, which I did.

20:36.520 --> 20:42.260
They didn't have the answer, but they get a chance to ask you a question, and if you don't have the answer,

20:42.340 --> 20:47.140
you don't get a pie in your face, but you also don't get the right to throw a pie in their face.

20:47.200 --> 20:51.080
So I asked the expert a question. He didn't know the answer. He asked me a question.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.320
I knew the answer, and so I got to throw a pie in his face.

20:54.900 --> 21:01.560
So I threw a pie in the face of somebody with whom I had had sometimes vicious arguments over the phone,

21:01.960 --> 21:06.640
and afterwards we went to a party together and were very friendly.

21:07.140 --> 21:12.860
So I think what people don't see in person, or who people don't see in person, they either fear,

21:13.060 --> 21:18.620
or they suspect that person's motives, because all they're hearing is this sometimes intruding voice over the telephone.

21:18.620 --> 21:24.440
Out here, where I'm with celebrities, if you will, day and night, so to speak,

21:25.360 --> 21:29.660
I go to interviews five or six, sometimes seven or eight interviews a week.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.200
Most of them in person. Sometimes they'll come to the house.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.380
I've thrown parties, for example, for a number of people.

21:37.420 --> 21:40.360
I won't use their names because I'm not trying to capitalize on the parties.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.900
They weren't show business parties, but they were parties involving friends,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.300
and I've thrown a half a dozen of those in the past year or so.

21:47.300 --> 21:52.100
And what I'm interested in now are the personal relationships as much as possible.

21:54.220 --> 21:55.620
Was that an answer to your question?

21:55.680 --> 22:01.920
That's a good answer. Yeah. This is enjoyable. This is totally different than I expected.

22:02.260 --> 22:03.580
What now? What did you expect?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.180
No, I expected something great.

22:06.380 --> 22:12.000
It's just I didn't realize you were so deeply involved in the popular entertainment scene.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.720
And this is educational for me. My wife will love it because she's quite interested in this.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.660
Have you ever come out to California to introduce you to a few of the studios?

22:21.780 --> 22:24.480
Okay, I may take you up on that. Believe me.

22:25.980 --> 22:30.060
You mentioned a while ago that when you were buying the science fiction stories,

22:31.220 --> 22:37.100
that you did buy some that you really didn't necessarily approve of,

22:37.180 --> 22:38.840
although you thought other people would like them.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.560
There have been...

22:40.560 --> 22:44.640
No, no, no. I didn't say that I bought them because I thought people would like them.

22:44.940 --> 22:52.040
There can be a wonderful story that we all dislike, but the author has said something worthwhile.

22:53.380 --> 22:58.560
And, you know, there are a number of stories I bought which maybe I liked and nobody else did,

22:58.640 --> 23:02.240
so I didn't necessarily buy a story for people to like them.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.020
I bought stories because I felt they were good and hoped people would like them.

23:08.440 --> 23:08.960
Okay.

23:11.900 --> 23:16.920
There have been critics in the past who have said that you censored things, that sort of thing.

23:17.240 --> 23:25.020
Is that really true or perhaps that's just a convenient word they can bring up because it didn't accept your story?

23:25.180 --> 23:25.920
The find the word for me and you use it.

23:26.660 --> 23:33.160
Censored, to me, would mean that there was material included which was blue lined or cut out or whatever.

23:33.160 --> 23:42.380
The story was used anyway or it was rejected solely for that content and not for literary content, let's say.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.040
That's just my interpretation.

23:44.640 --> 23:50.100
Hello, Kay, I'm not trying to hedge, but I want to think of instances and so forth.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.640
I wish I could be specific. I just remember, you know, reading through the years.

23:54.980 --> 24:01.840
If that's the way you use the word censored, yeah, I guess it would crop up or it did crop up.

24:02.800 --> 24:09.160
But I don't use the word censored so much as exercise personal taste.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.560
Now, I think this question was brought up many years ago.

24:13.140 --> 24:13.660
Yes.

24:13.860 --> 24:22.280
And my response to the author or the interviewer or the other editor or the publisher or whoever it was that were the fans who raised the question was,

24:22.280 --> 24:25.040
all right, let me respond to that with a question.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.140
Would you publish a story?

24:29.180 --> 24:42.980
A wonderfully written, artistically valid, well plotted, believable character, interesting story that drew you into the action and at the end you had to admit that it was just pure dynamite.

24:42.980 --> 24:54.180
Would you, however, publish such a story that accused your mother of being a whore who gave birth to you illegitimately?

24:55.340 --> 24:59.760
And the writer says, no, of course, that would be personally insulting to somebody I love.

25:00.160 --> 25:07.080
I said, for that same reason, I will not publish a story that defames God or Jesus Christ in any way.

25:08.420 --> 25:13.520
Or that defames my country or that defames my parents, if you will.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.260
I would not publish a story for the very same reason.

25:16.560 --> 25:22.840
If I found a story and there's a slight contradiction here thinking back to what I said earlier, I would not.

25:23.120 --> 25:28.140
I said earlier I might publish or I did publish stories that were personally offensive.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.460
It's on a case by case basis.

25:30.840 --> 25:36.820
I might find a story that advocated something, whatever that something was.

25:36.820 --> 25:37.980
It was personally offensive.

25:38.380 --> 25:47.840
But I would not publish a story that ridiculed or that defamed my religion or, frankly, anybody else's because that would be a different type of offensive.

25:48.200 --> 25:58.680
I might agree that a person who advocated something certainly had the freedom to advocate that, and I might not agree with it.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.760
I would publish it anyway if it were a good story.

26:01.060 --> 26:05.480
However, I think that there's too much, and this is another reason why person to person exists,

26:05.480 --> 26:17.160
there's too much negative journalism, there's too much negative fiction where anything goes under the guise of artistic liberty.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.380
I would never advocate general censorship.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.500
Let's say this, I would never advocate institutionalized censorship.

26:25.500 --> 26:41.660
But an editor or a movie director or whatever, they have the right, according to their personal views, to say, well, I like that and I'll publish it, or I like that and I'll produce it or direct it.

26:41.840 --> 26:47.400
Or I don't like it and I won't publish it, and I don't like it and I won't produce it or direct it.

26:47.400 --> 26:53.500
They have that right to guide their project according to their personal tastes.

26:54.060 --> 27:15.520
You would never catch, for example, and I think I am surmising this properly, Alan Alda or Ed Astner producing a movie or a TV show that presented a favorable picture of Ronald Reagan.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.500
They would find that personally offensive.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.040
So are they exercising censorship when they're exercising their own personal tastes?

27:24.460 --> 27:25.240
I don't think so.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.660
Thank you for that answer. That was a hard question for me to ask.

27:31.580 --> 27:32.680
How did my answer sound?

27:32.760 --> 27:33.540
It sounds great.

27:34.360 --> 27:43.520
I know now why, when I said this interview was a surprise, and I'm used to interviewing science fiction authors and they never ask me questions.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.960
They don't make me define my terms.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.420
So this is enjoyable. It doesn't feel like such a one-way street.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.420
Well, don't forget, I am an interviewer too.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.060
You're in trouble tonight.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.620
No, I need to learn a lot.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
I'm going to find out about you tonight.

27:58.920 --> 28:04.780
No, before we leave anthologies, I want to ask one more question on that.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.260
Did you discover any new writers?

28:08.600 --> 28:13.620
And if you did, is that kind of a high point of being an editor? I would think it would be.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.040
It really is.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.680
Golly, discover.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.540
I did discover some.

28:22.580 --> 28:27.760
I think a better term with a bulk of the newer writers is that rather than discover them,

28:27.760 --> 28:35.380
I helped, we're using the word properly, augment their careers, or I augmented their careers.

28:36.020 --> 28:38.240
One writer who comes to mind is Steve Gold.

28:38.940 --> 28:47.600
Steve, I think, has said in print and to me personally that I helped propel his career along.

28:47.940 --> 28:53.540
Did I discover, and I'm sure that other editors or anthologists published Steve before I did,

28:53.540 --> 29:01.340
but I gave him, I think, in terms of novels and short stories, a real, his career, rather, a real impetus,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.620
and probably did something to help him.

29:04.220 --> 29:10.160
In Barry Malzberg's case, he certainly was around with Beyond the Apollo and others long before,

29:10.560 --> 29:15.540
well, maybe not so long, but before I came on the scene so energetically,

29:15.540 --> 29:24.160
but I bought more article, not sorry, more short stories and more novels from Barry than any other single editor,

29:24.500 --> 29:34.040
and probably did something major or minor, negligible or significant to help establish him more than he had been.

29:34.360 --> 29:41.120
But, oh, some writers I discovered, Golly, I think there was one writer named J.J. Russ

29:41.120 --> 29:48.000
who wrote a very good story, kind of a story which was a commentary on pornography and striptease artists,

29:48.960 --> 29:54.560
and then there were so many others that I may have bought one story from and maybe didn't buy any others,

29:54.700 --> 29:58.180
and maybe nobody ever heard from them again, so when you say discover a writer,

29:58.700 --> 30:06.340
that implies that you found a Hemingway, or you found another writer of similar stature, an Irving Stone or someone,

30:06.340 --> 30:11.600
and from that moment of beginning, they went on to great things.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.700
I can't honestly say that I was responsible in that way for discovering a writer.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.360
That's how you apply the word discover.

30:20.840 --> 30:25.360
I want to move on now to Laser Books, the laser series which you edited.

30:25.940 --> 30:29.300
How did you get involved in that? How did that get started?

30:29.300 --> 30:36.700
Well, I read in Publishers Weekly an interview with the president of the company,

30:36.900 --> 30:41.420
Hollick when the enterprise is limited, an interview with Larry Heisey,

30:42.580 --> 30:50.200
and he seemed to be suggesting, perhaps between the lines, that they would love to do books

30:50.200 --> 30:55.700
beyond simply the romance field in which they had been until that time and still are a leader,

30:55.700 --> 30:59.560
or a theme leader rather, they tend to millions of books every year.

31:01.080 --> 31:07.180
So I thought I would call up Heisey, and I did, and got through reasonably quickly,

31:07.500 --> 31:13.540
and indicated to him the science fiction field and movies that were coming out that would help

31:15.740 --> 31:19.960
give the popularity of science fiction a real foundation, a continuing foundation.

31:20.500 --> 31:25.300
He said, send me a letter, I'd love to talk to you about it, so I sent him, apparently, a persuasive letter,

31:25.840 --> 31:29.380
and he called me up a few days later, remember at that time I was living in New Jersey,

31:29.380 --> 31:35.460
so it wasn't such a chore to get to New York, it was a two hour or so drive, whether I drove or went by bus,

31:35.720 --> 31:40.480
and he said, I'm really interested, why don't you meet me at bus in such a hotel, so I did,

31:40.620 --> 31:45.420
and we had a further meeting, and then they paid for me to come up to Toronto, Canada,

31:46.040 --> 31:51.300
and I met with their board of directors and all, and their salespeople, it was really a very nice meeting,

31:51.300 --> 31:56.960
so they decided a week or two later to get into science fiction via laser books,

31:57.840 --> 32:04.580
and I've talked with the people, the new people at Harlequin since then, since laser books failed,

32:05.600 --> 32:13.700
and all sorts of post mortems on the situation, but I would say if I have any bitterness,

32:14.420 --> 32:18.380
and somebody observed about me recently that I don't hold any grudges, but I am human,

32:18.380 --> 32:23.720
so there is a residue of bitterness or regret, maybe regret more than bitterness,

32:24.340 --> 32:32.160
is that, well, Harlequin had the money to do the books properly, and when I say money to do the books properly,

32:32.480 --> 32:48.360
publicize them, distribute them, etc. Where it fell short is everything, and this is not a mean criticism of Harlequin,

32:48.360 --> 32:55.440
certainly, in any way. They fell short because every book had to fit into a formula that they developed.

32:56.240 --> 33:04.040
Certain lengths, certain type of story, always a male protagonist, the cover design had to be,

33:04.340 --> 33:12.020
ostensibly at least, always the same design, so it was this formula, and what I found myself facing

33:12.020 --> 33:22.020
was if I had a fair book by a writer that fit the formula, and a really good book by a writer

33:22.020 --> 33:33.120
that was maybe off in one or two, possibly even minor points, I had to buy the book that was fair

33:33.120 --> 33:40.320
and reject the book that was quite good. Perfect case is a writer, golly, I must be getting older's name,

33:40.320 --> 33:48.880
I forget, she's a little female writer, she wrote a book that fit the Harlequin approach to laser books in every way.

33:49.360 --> 33:59.920
Action adventure, upbeat ending, no profanity, no blatant sex, I mean it went right on down the line,

34:00.500 --> 34:08.980
and where it fell short, instead of having the principal protagonist, a guy, it was a woman.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.280
And so therefore it had to be rejected, but it was so good.

34:13.620 --> 34:24.620
And what I got hard and run out of town for you might say is, oh golly, so many of the books are only fair or mediocre,

34:26.040 --> 34:29.420
but that's unfortunately the way it turned out.

34:32.340 --> 34:38.900
So it was Harlequin who's more or less set the editorial policy that you had to follow, who's dictated to you?

34:40.000 --> 34:45.320
Totally, now, again, hindsight not doing anybody one bit of good.

34:47.540 --> 34:53.960
If I had it to do over again, famous words might as well not be fed for all the good they do,

34:53.960 --> 35:03.080
but if I had it to do over again, I would have been much more pigheaded, not only at the beginning, but later,

35:03.840 --> 35:14.600
and I would have said, alright, if you want me to buy the mediocre book, fine, but you do really want to be known for a series of mediocre books.

35:14.600 --> 35:25.120
I said because in the science fiction field, interestingly enough, the commercial route is the route that you want to follow,

35:25.120 --> 35:34.700
and that is best achieved if you publish good books, and if you publish books that have some divergence of style and plotting and so forth,

35:34.700 --> 35:47.640
is the science fiction field more than the western field, more than the detective or mystery field, responds negatively to the routine and the pedestrian and the predictable.

35:48.140 --> 35:55.760
It may work in the romance field, it may work in, and mind you, your books are great within the limitations of the genre,

35:55.760 --> 36:03.920
but the science fiction genre, by its very nature, is an unfettered genre where you can go to the moon, you can go to the stars,

36:04.060 --> 36:10.120
you can go inside the earth, you can go back in time, you can go forward in time, you can do so many things.

36:10.260 --> 36:23.580
The beauty of the genre is that you have no real limitations in that respect, so what you want to do is superimpose a formula of limitations on an unformulized novel genre.

36:25.660 --> 36:40.040
I said it's going to be death eventually, but frankly it was a good contract, they were exceptionally nice people, and it was a very enticing situation that I really would not duplicate again.

36:40.040 --> 36:58.320
If a publisher, Harlequin or whoever, and I were to touch again, I would want virtually total editorial autonomy within previously agreed parameters.

36:58.320 --> 37:10.700
There has to be parameters of some sort. I mean no publisher will let, and shouldn't let an editor publish three novels of a thousand pages a piece every month.

37:11.160 --> 37:18.320
I mean there have to be some financial or other limitations, but within those parameters I would want total editorial integrity.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.340
That's the way I would do it again, because that doesn't do any good now.

37:22.140 --> 37:27.080
What kind of audience did the Harlequin people have visualize for the laser series?

37:29.620 --> 37:37.920
That's tougher. I think, well this was covered at one convention I did attend, and I didn't attend very many as I said to my regret.

37:38.920 --> 37:54.200
The fan of science fiction who felt that there was too much quirkiness getting into the genre, there was too much blatant sexuality getting into the genre,

37:54.200 --> 38:03.920
and that the science fiction at its best is the science fiction epitomized by Hugo Gernsback, John W. Campbell.

38:04.400 --> 38:16.340
By the way, let me add parenthetically that John W. Campbell, if he was a dictator, was far more of a censor-wielding dictator than I ever was,

38:16.340 --> 38:24.680
but the science fiction epitomized by Campbell and Gernsback in a more poetic sense by Ray Bradbury and so on,

38:25.100 --> 38:36.480
you would not really catch, you would not really have caught Gernsback or Campbell publishing anything that was even, I guess, remotely sexually suggestive.

38:36.860 --> 38:42.140
You certainly would not catch Ray Bradbury publishing, quote, an offensive story.

38:43.300 --> 38:52.360
And so I felt that I fit more, and I've been compared to, that mold than in any other type, and I just lost track of your question.

38:53.520 --> 39:01.400
Me too. Oh yeah, for what audience? I think you answered it the first time, but what audience was that intended for?

39:01.400 --> 39:12.200
What audience, the classical, ah, okay, perfect example. The audience that responded with such energy to Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back,

39:12.560 --> 39:25.260
close encounters and now ET. Not the audience which would have responded to some dark, perverse, sexually explicit kind of material.

39:27.980 --> 39:38.460
Okay, that series did fail. Did it fail, and I assume that that means financially, did it really lose money or just not make as much money as Harlequin wanted it to?

39:38.780 --> 39:49.980
Well, I'm told, and I have nothing concrete in my hand right now to volitify this in any way, but I was told here, say in Bond and all,

39:49.980 --> 40:01.180
what I was told was this, the Harlequin book sold as well at the time as the average Dahl book and maybe even the average Bees book.

40:01.660 --> 40:12.840
But Harlequin used to 100,000 copies per book, 200,000, maybe even 300,000, was not content with 30, 40, 50,000 copies.

40:15.260 --> 40:22.900
Okay, yeah, Don Walheim told us that I think he said that 30,000 books was what was required for the Dahl book to break even.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.840
So I guess 50,000 is money in his pocket, I mean.

40:27.100 --> 40:39.100
Yes, and also Harlequin did spend a lot of money advertising the books. And you know, it's interesting, a number of the authors, seven, eight, ten, however many,

40:39.100 --> 40:49.660
have told me, subsequent to the suspension of publication of laser books, that over the following six months to a year after the books were suspended,

40:50.260 --> 40:54.420
they were getting royally checks. I think one writer got beyond his original bands, of course.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.460
One writer was surprised to open up an envelope for Harlequin one day and find a check for $1,100.

41:00.860 --> 41:13.280
The authors certainly didn't lose money. Quite a number of the authors got additional royalties, but it just wasn't successful enough for Harlequin to continue.

41:14.240 --> 41:20.380
This is something that's hearsay or it's an impression that's been built up over the years reading about that situation.

41:20.380 --> 41:35.040
But I understand that perhaps the Harlequin people didn't realize that people buy science fiction authors, and they buy some author, a famous author,

41:35.200 --> 41:39.980
they'll buy a Frank Herbert, whereas if they see an unknown, they won't buy that book.

41:40.140 --> 41:44.820
And they assumed that the science fiction people would buy the book just because it was science fiction.

41:44.820 --> 41:51.920
Well, I would tend more to agree, oh, golly, that we're going in three directions there.

41:52.100 --> 42:01.620
We're saying they'll buy the book because it's science fiction, they'll buy the book because it's a name author, and they won't buy the book because it's an unknown author.

42:01.720 --> 42:07.580
Well, I disagree with the fact that they won't buy the book because it's an unknown author. I'll get that out.

42:07.580 --> 42:22.560
An unknown author, Steve Golden, at the time, with his other books was quasi-unknown, and there were so many authors who weren't extremely well-known, such as Ray Nelson, such as others.

42:23.600 --> 42:37.520
And those books sold better than any of the other Harlequin books. Certainly Jerry Pornell sold well, but at the time, he hadn't really had the $100,000 successes that he's having today.

42:37.520 --> 42:49.440
So I would disagree with the fact that if a book is presented well, and this was in those days, maybe today it's a little more sophisticated, a little more selective, better word,

42:50.100 --> 43:05.220
I think if the book looked appealing, the author was not necessarily the deciding factor. Obviously, though, if we'd had Philip K. Dick and Paul Anderson and Bob Silverberg and so on right for us,

43:05.220 --> 43:15.200
the sales would have been better. But even so, I remember talking to Bob Silverberg about one of his books that was with Signet, New American Library.

43:15.880 --> 43:31.800
If I recall properly, it had gone through two printings, and by the end of the second printing had sold the grand total over a period of X number of years, had sold the grand total of 80,000 copies.

43:31.800 --> 43:48.760
Well, that's Bob Silverberg. I doubt the Harlequin would have been satisfied waiting X number of years for a book to sell one half or one third or one quarter of what the average romance book sold in six months.

43:50.620 --> 43:57.520
Okay, I got you just a matter of perspective, really. Okay, tell you what, let me change my tape.

43:57.520 --> 44:01.360
Let me get a glass of water and I will be right back. Okay, great. Thank you.
