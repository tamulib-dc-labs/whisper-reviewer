WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.500
Okay, the tape is on.

00:02.940 --> 00:04.760
So we'll act straight and all that.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.700
Okay, also, ever president of the series is the bondage.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.800
I mean, you've got the physical bondage of Estre, but you've also got the, I guess,

00:14.840 --> 00:17.580
metaphoric bondage of the whole planet, that sort of thing.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.520
What was the...

00:20.520 --> 00:22.700
Was that just Estre's fate?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.600
I mean, that's when she lived and that's the brakes, folks.

00:25.060 --> 00:30.500
We're all stuck in this physical body and we're also what was, I think, annoying me.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.140
Most was the limitations of logic.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.980
That was the bondage that was bothering me at the time.

00:37.180 --> 00:41.680
I was fooling around with, you know, paradoxes that...

00:41.680 --> 00:45.600
Utilizing the tortoise and the rest of that, trying to make some determination of my own

00:45.600 --> 00:46.800
as to what was going on.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.280
And we were throwing up our hands in that project and saying,

00:50.280 --> 00:51.900
well, you know, there's no way we're never...

00:51.900 --> 00:55.900
While you're in a human body and immersed in time, there's no way you're going to be able

00:55.900 --> 01:03.940
to make any determination as to the nature of time or the degree to which it preceded

01:05.000 --> 01:08.600
motion space, the rest of it, what comes first, the chicken or the egg thing.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.980
So there's bondage on every level.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.540
Certainly the limitations of the intellectual part of what I was talking about.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.860
And I'm just carrying it out and being consistent.

01:19.260 --> 01:26.080
The female and male bondage equally, really, for those characters, they were tremendously

01:26.080 --> 01:27.860
limited by their genetic sexuality.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.700
So I meant it that way, too.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.700
And fooling around with the...

01:33.520 --> 01:40.120
Trying to show people that it's fun, you know, there's an element in young girls which makes

01:40.120 --> 01:43.540
rape fantasies attractive.

01:44.260 --> 01:46.460
And the reality is not in any way attractive.

01:47.460 --> 01:52.040
Trying to point that difference out that it's not nice if it happens to you.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.240
That's another reason I did that.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.960
The first book, particularly, was First Person.

01:57.420 --> 02:02.120
Violence is not fun if you've ever been in a difficult or a violent situation,

02:02.360 --> 02:06.940
ever been tied up or attacked by a hospital or any of the above.

02:06.940 --> 02:10.380
You find that it is an altered state in which you are not happy to be.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.360
And some of that, indeed, was from experience.

02:14.660 --> 02:22.260
We got into a lot of dicey situations during our New York time and the time that we were

02:22.260 --> 02:22.880
underground.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.800
And my husband was a federal fugitive and his life was tough.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.620
So there are the bondages on every level.

02:31.620 --> 02:39.800
But I think for me it was the intellectual bondage combined with the internal bondage of

02:40.480 --> 02:48.060
a person to their own sexuality, whichever sex or sort of sub-set of sex that we have now,

02:48.340 --> 02:53.520
so many open groups of people who are changing sex or choosing to

02:54.760 --> 02:58.960
copulate with the same sex or whatever they want to do.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.240
Everybody is stuck.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.140
Within the bondage of their genetic conditioning, whatever it happens to me,

03:05.200 --> 03:09.620
I mean, you don't see too many people that have transcended on any level

03:10.880 --> 03:14.620
what their genes are allowing them to do and what their physical body is allowing them to do,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.840
as we said before, to Kevin Riech, God's dad, is very frustrating.

03:19.860 --> 03:25.300
The Wind from the Abyss was one of the most frustrating books I've ever read.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.640
And by frustrating, I mean, I was really pulling for Estri and here she was,

03:31.060 --> 03:35.720
this kind of cute little sorority girl again with no brain and no abilities.

03:36.440 --> 03:40.240
And I've read that, I think Tanneth Lee does a good job with that, chapters at a time,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.200
but this was the whole book or at least a good part of the book.

03:43.440 --> 03:47.900
So that's something I really enjoyed was that frustration that,

03:47.960 --> 03:51.100
you know, I wish you'd hurry up and break out of it so we can get on.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.940
That was very interesting. That was quite a good job of writing.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.320
Well, I was really trying to make it real and give them something.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.660
I can bring back to this world and you know, part of the reason that you abstract so far

04:04.660 --> 04:10.300
and the reason I had them have no awareness of our culture and our science and our mores

04:10.300 --> 04:15.920
was so that what is useful and what is in a sense universal will stand out better.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.960
I mean, that's another, that's the value of fantasy if it's done well,

04:19.540 --> 04:22.620
is what is not far and is very familiar.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.460
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.740
Very much so.

04:27.920 --> 04:36.900
I got to ask this question, where are we in, we earthlings 1983 during the Celestra?

04:37.380 --> 04:41.820
Are these humans that have descended from us or have these preceded us or what?

04:41.920 --> 04:42.880
What's your idea on that?

04:43.020 --> 04:47.080
Well, they're over there having all this right now while we're over here stuck by ourselves.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.540
That's my feeling about it.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.460
But it's all right now out there somewhere.

04:52.080 --> 04:57.480
And we're just not, you know, we're just in the big terms if you consider, you know,

04:57.520 --> 05:01.360
the distances involved and I'm sure you know this, we've only been civilized for a minute.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.540
So nobody would have found us yet if there's something out there.

05:07.660 --> 05:12.260
So it could all be going on exactly now and we just aren't a part of it.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.980
What would our compatibility index be with the Celestrans?

05:19.040 --> 05:26.560
Oh dear, um, dad, well let's say just for this sake of being positive, pretty good.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.540
I would think it wouldn't be too bad.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.140
You mean the chances of you fathering a child on a Celestran woman?

05:33.640 --> 05:33.880
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.040
Through the interviewers, 95 percent.

05:36.280 --> 05:36.800
Okay.

05:36.940 --> 05:45.460
Okay, now we come to the the carrion saga or whatever,

05:45.460 --> 05:46.640
carrion books, whatever.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.200
Once again, was this a planned series?

05:49.420 --> 05:51.880
Did you covalently set out to say I'm going to write three books?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.240
Yeah, I was going to do three.

05:54.540 --> 05:55.900
I signed for them before I did them.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.220
Three is all there was going to be.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.680
Three is all there is going to be.

06:00.280 --> 06:04.440
You know, unless something drastically changes, then I see where it's someplace that I'd like to take it.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.300
I knew exactly what I wanted to talk about, the physics and the rest of it.

06:09.860 --> 06:14.460
I was, I wanted to create a female character that had all the flaws that Estri did not.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.660
That was totally opposite.

06:17.620 --> 06:21.440
And to talk a little about politics, I come from a very

06:22.980 --> 06:24.100
political background.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.600
My half sister was Carter, speech radio and economic policy.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.880
I know way too much about politics to suit me.

06:31.340 --> 06:37.440
And I want to talk a little bit about politics and decision making and at higher levels and

06:38.070 --> 06:45.940
what indeed happens to the people involved in it and the people affected by it who have no control of it.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.440
And the nice stuff for me that balanced it off was

06:52.840 --> 06:57.200
the culture that was comfortable with its technology, growing into its technology,

06:57.340 --> 06:59.020
growing along with its technology.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.600
And I mean, for me, the cruisers were the main characters there.

07:02.700 --> 07:06.940
I loved doing the cruisers sections, although they were very difficult at times.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.320
To make it really

07:10.360 --> 07:10.760
seen

07:12.160 --> 07:13.520
as if they were cruisers.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.080
And, you know, one never knows if one succeeded, but for me, they really were cruisers.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.040
Plus, I had the whole of history to draw on.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.060
Instead of having culture that had nothing to do with us,

07:25.140 --> 07:27.160
I had a culture that has everything to do with us.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.420
There has been no collapse, no World War III.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.460
Everything has proceeded at pace and just gotten worse.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.660
The problems with quantum mechanics hadn't been solved.

07:35.900 --> 07:36.640
The problems with it.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.800
Nothing else had been solved.

07:37.900 --> 07:40.420
And we were just sort of muddling along the way we tend to do.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.680
And that, to me, was a lot of fun.

07:43.260 --> 07:47.800
But as I said, I did the partial and it went to auction in two countries on the partial.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.700
And I was so told here in England at the same time had two editors

07:54.300 --> 07:56.180
trying to keep the volumes consistent.

07:56.420 --> 07:59.860
You know, every editor has a different idea of what exactly they want you to do.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.080
And they all want to mix them.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.920
I'm very seldom getting an editor that leaves you totally alone.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.760
It doesn't bother you at all about a book.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.220
And I had to split the difference on one occasion between them

08:12.220 --> 08:14.180
where one editor wanted one section to be longer

08:14.180 --> 08:16.240
and the other one wanted the same section to be shorter.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.800
In the same, just the same 30 pages.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.220
And I ended up doing a prologue which seemed to satisfy them both.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.640
I think they forgot what they asked me to do, but it had to do something super.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.400
So I had done that.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.880
So they were cold-bloodedly meant to be exactly what they are.

08:32.180 --> 08:35.720
But I took terrible risks in that book, that group of books.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.760
That's the only time I've really...

08:38.420 --> 08:41.280
I would go to conventions and I would ask them

08:41.860 --> 08:44.220
if they wanted more science than their science fiction.

08:44.380 --> 08:47.080
Because I'd gotten to a point where I really wanted to see some more science.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.740
And I was wondering if we were becoming dinosaurs.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.360
I mean, here's this one fertile area of fiction.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.320
You can't even write a contemporary novel now and have it be contemporary

08:57.320 --> 08:59.960
without having a good understanding of technology.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.920
Otherwise, you're writing a historical book that was meant for the 40s

09:03.920 --> 09:05.720
that just happens to be the 70s, the 80s.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.720
And people aren't dealing with technology.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.140
They aren't even dealing with the romantic end of it.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.520
No end of it whatsoever.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.040
So I go to these conventions and they'd all raise their hands and say,

09:16.140 --> 09:17.160
yes, they want more science.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.380
And yes, they were ready to work a little.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.760
And yes, they wanted to be challenged.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.680
And I said, okay, well, we don't.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.140
And I wrote a book in which I wrote to my ideal reader

09:27.320 --> 09:29.500
didn't talk down, didn't simplify it,

09:31.340 --> 09:36.420
did what I consider a good job of explaining mathematics as poetry and just left line.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.040
And so far the reaction to it's been very good.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.520
As I told you, the first printing has had been through two

09:42.520 --> 09:44.300
printing before publication or three.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.300
Has been doing very well.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.740
You get some people that don't want to work.

09:49.100 --> 09:53.040
But I think there's enough story there to carry them over the parts

09:53.040 --> 09:55.220
that they are not willing to try to understand.

09:57.420 --> 10:01.140
I want to take this opportunity now to look at the characters.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.240
This I kind of mentioned this on the phone the other night, but this is for the tape.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.920
We're introduced the first character other than Shibat.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.140
And this is Marata, the man.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.320
And he, we like him at first, but then he obviously turns into a bastard.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.380
And then Karen is dislikeable at the first.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.620
I didn't care for him.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.900
And then he turns likeable.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.320
David Spry, I never did like.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.020
I mean, I'm not talking about the way he was written, but the character.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.100
He just bothered me.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.300
And then in the first series, is it Cheyenne?

10:33.560 --> 10:34.860
How was his name pronounced?

10:35.880 --> 10:36.360
Ken, okay.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.480
He was a bastard at first.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.660
And then he turned out okay.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.720
And Sarah kind of switched back and forth.

10:41.880 --> 10:49.100
So the point is your characters do turn out to be, they seem to be one thing.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.480
And then they turn into something else.

10:50.820 --> 10:54.240
And for one thing, most science fiction doesn't have characters this deep.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.560
But they certainly aren't chameleons like this.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.540
And how do you do that?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.660
And what are you driving at here?

11:01.900 --> 11:02.160
Okay.

11:02.300 --> 11:09.780
Well, I find that in life, people tend to show you what they are at the first meeting for one thing.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.960
What you're getting from a person in an initial meeting is what they want to project,

11:15.080 --> 11:17.280
which is usually something that covers their problems.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.080
And very few people are on it.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.160
So a first meeting of somebody is almost always a polar opposite.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.240
They're covering their weaknesses.

11:26.140 --> 11:30.320
They're trying to direct you in a particular direction as to their view of them.

11:31.060 --> 11:35.340
At times you get an impression of what they would like to be if they're very good at it.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.360
And it disintegrates from there.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.380
You can get less than that from people.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.840
But I find in life that you can't judge a person at first meeting.

11:44.460 --> 11:50.740
I knew from the Marata character, initially was meant over the period of one book to turn

11:50.740 --> 11:57.540
from an apparent good guy to a troubled bad guy over the three books.

11:58.060 --> 12:01.220
Hiran was supposed to make that same kind of transition.

12:02.400 --> 12:08.160
And even Shabbat, who is back in a sense of traditional heroin in the first book,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.860
is really an ancillary character in the third book.

12:10.940 --> 12:16.920
So those were structural things that I was doing purposely, consciously, and for fun in those books.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.480
Because I think that they say something about humanity.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.800
But I never lied to you about any of those characters.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.880
Marata's father had a hammer on both those kids from the beginning.

12:27.740 --> 12:31.120
And he told it straight and true exactly what they were.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.680
The other thing that was stated in the beginning, which was consistent,

12:34.900 --> 12:37.740
if one wanted to accept it from the reading, is that all pilots are crazy.

12:38.560 --> 12:44.720
And anybody who becomes a pilot is going to get crazy within what the non-pilots consider sanity.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.060
And as Shabbat became closer and closer to the cruiser,

12:48.220 --> 12:51.820
she did find her relations with humans more and more tenuous.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.140
Spry held back so much information there were hints, right?

12:58.800 --> 13:02.060
In the first book that Spry was not at all what he seemed, and this is

13:03.700 --> 13:08.000
what he wanted to do was very different from what it appeared to be that he was doing.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.960
But he was the most fun of the characters to work with because he was,

13:12.860 --> 13:19.720
he had no pretensions of a higher morality in the term of long-term good beyond his

13:20.420 --> 13:24.040
interaction with the other pilots, what he wanted for them.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.200
And even that was reasonably short-term.

13:26.340 --> 13:31.980
He was just a pragmatist and a mover and shaker, the kind of guy that gets things done.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.220
An intelligence type really is what he is, having known a number of them.

13:37.220 --> 13:41.060
And intelligence types tend to behave very much like that.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.460
You really don't see them until later on.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.500
You must have made some in your work.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.040
Oh yes.

13:50.620 --> 13:55.740
Yeah, if you were ever going to do any more in this milieu, I think a prequel

13:55.740 --> 14:00.760
featuring the old man would be interesting because I hated to see him die off because he was really

14:00.760 --> 14:02.580
a good character, really enjoyable.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, I felt bad about that too.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.640
I usually give a character a choice.

14:09.300 --> 14:13.460
You want to die now or you want to live along a bit longer.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.540
And with that particular character, he chose his moment.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.340
That was the, you know, he had it together and he got his things done and he had to do.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.260
A prequel would not be a bad idea, it would be fun.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.760
And it wouldn't be that.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.000
What happened was conceptually that I think Earthreams took it about

14:33.700 --> 14:37.600
as far as I would dare take it without a lot of feedback from an audience that

14:37.600 --> 14:41.980
they were willing to go another step into that kind of abstract thought.

14:42.180 --> 14:51.060
I did that to find out if people really, really are willing and interested in putting in that

14:51.060 --> 14:51.940
kind of effort in a book.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.160
And I don't know, you know, I'm going to find out.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.580
I'm going to hear back.

14:57.080 --> 15:02.540
But to take it further would be to get very, very abstract with the concepts involved.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.200
And I would rather back up and do a simpler one.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.200
But you've got to be, you've got to fulfill the things that you say you're going to do in a book.

15:11.640 --> 15:15.980
And I couldn't leave that book without handling the technical problems that I had created.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.980
And I just solved them or at least explained.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.840
Where do you get feedback?

15:21.140 --> 15:26.320
Do you go to cons or do you just think that the sales reflect, the sales are feedback?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.860
Well, I used to go to more conventions than I do now.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.700
One, because I've been doing books out of Sean.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.840
I don't go a lot.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.420
And my research, when I'm researching takes up a tremendous amount of time.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.300
Two, because I'm just, on one hand, I'm arrogant.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.540
I like to control things.

15:43.880 --> 15:48.360
But on the other hand, I'm very sensitive and I can always manage to get offended if somebody says,

15:49.720 --> 15:51.960
I was guest of honor at Catacombs last year.

15:52.100 --> 15:52.620
I did that one.

15:52.780 --> 15:58.060
And I'm going to do Lunacon in March because I really liked that New York crowd.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.300
Otherwise, I mean, my writing schedules is very heavy.

16:01.300 --> 16:04.180
I've got, I just turned in a book.

16:04.840 --> 16:10.000
I just started a book, which is doing just about the amount of time I have to finish it.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.360
I don't have a lot of extra time

16:15.460 --> 16:17.620
to do more than the work that I'm doing.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.420
I'm real conscientious of my homework.

16:20.020 --> 16:24.420
And a lot of times there's, you can never know enough about the subjects that you're writing

16:24.420 --> 16:24.680
about.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.520
And when you're creating whole worlds, you find there's something that you need to know that you

16:28.520 --> 16:31.640
haven't, I mean, physics alone will not get you through a science fiction novel,

16:32.340 --> 16:34.500
nor will any other specialty, not biology.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.380
There's no single thing you can do.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.100
It's going to allow you to create an entire culture and change it.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.980
It's not just creating the culture.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.100
You've got to be able to create it and change it.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.700
So the homework really takes a tremendous amount of effort.

16:50.380 --> 16:55.420
And it's nice to do a fantasy book now as almost as a break or a pay vacation because

16:57.580 --> 17:01.980
that homework I did years ago, and I remember all the things I need to know to do that.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.240
I don't have to, I think I have like three books on my desk,

17:05.900 --> 17:09.620
you know, actually just cosmic fragments, one on Asian fighting styles and a classical

17:09.620 --> 17:10.760
dictionary from Oxford.

17:11.180 --> 17:15.600
And that is all I need rather than, you know, three shelves and the stool and a pile on the

17:15.600 --> 17:19.140
floor of stuff that I have to be able to refer to all the time.

17:20.060 --> 17:24.160
So cons, the kind of feedback you get at cons,

17:26.340 --> 17:28.320
isn't as good as I could see back through letters.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.320
I don't trust reviewers because when my first book came out,

17:32.500 --> 17:36.880
AJ Badres reviewed me twice on the same book and two different publications.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.040
It gave me two totally opposite reviews.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.380
So I learned my lesson early.

17:42.400 --> 17:47.560
But sales figures and letters are really the way, and also, you know, there are readers around

17:47.560 --> 17:53.100
here. I do some, you know, I do book signings and I do small things where I can control it a

17:53.100 --> 17:58.620
little better than I can. It's a real big, I mean, I'll do a World Con or I'd went to England's

17:58.620 --> 18:03.220
to see Con. I do one or two a year, but really all the time that I want to give it,

18:04.820 --> 18:08.640
it takes me about a week. It's a different person that has to go to a con.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.720
My writer is too open. So I had to create another person, my author.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.920
And the author goes to the cons and it takes me about a week to get rid of this author afterwards,

18:19.040 --> 18:22.260
because when you sit at that typewriter, there's no room for you, the writer.

18:22.260 --> 18:27.540
You have to erase yourself so that the characters can be there and the story can come.

18:28.420 --> 18:34.600
And if I'm self conscious or somebody has said something to me about there being too much

18:34.600 --> 18:39.820
science or not enough science or that my books of fantasy is to get really upset with the fantasy

18:39.820 --> 18:47.280
levels, I'm rather take it too much to heart and to react to it on paper and do something to my

18:47.280 --> 18:51.900
story, which I don't want to happen because it's something that's happened. I just got a real

18:51.900 --> 18:56.740
good review in the New York Daily News. And I hate the good ones as much as I hate the bad ones.

18:56.900 --> 19:02.380
They never like them for the right reasons. So the best thing really is just the letters from

19:02.380 --> 19:07.260
people who read them three times and loved them, or who asked me intelligent questions,

19:07.300 --> 19:13.460
which I try to answer. And other writers, sometimes good feedback, especially in the

19:13.460 --> 19:17.920
sanctuary projects where we're all working with the same frame spot and everybody switches

19:17.920 --> 19:24.160
material before it gets turned in. I get good feedback from those people. But I have, in the

19:24.160 --> 19:30.080
end, I've got to be happy with it. If I'm not happy, I hold a book a couple months before it

19:30.080 --> 19:34.800
turned in. And you have a gut feeling if you've left something out or you've screwed up. The

19:34.800 --> 19:39.440
earth seems to be the only time I ever knew that I'd pleased myself. And I wondered whether I was

19:39.440 --> 19:45.840
going to please other people. The only book that I really took it to an extreme that I think was

19:45.840 --> 19:50.360
important to do invaluable in the long term, which may not suit everybody in the short term.

19:53.560 --> 20:00.040
Okay, one of the central themes in the first two Karrion books, especially, was

20:01.360 --> 20:09.380
Shebbett's problem with her magic versus Karrion science. And that seems to harken back to what

20:09.380 --> 20:13.860
you said earlier about your experiences being a logical person who was having problems with

20:13.860 --> 20:19.960
pre-cog and ESP. It's very annoying to have dreams that come true. My specialty is car dreams.

20:20.920 --> 20:26.220
If there's going to be something wrong with my car, I have a dream about it. Two flat tires on

20:26.220 --> 20:32.020
the road to Chicago in the rain, right? So I wake up and we buy two tires and the other two go flat.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.480
I had a knife room where I woke my husband up in the middle of the night, said, brand auto supply,

20:36.640 --> 20:40.980
and went back to sleep. It turned out that the only place in New York City you could get a flat

20:40.980 --> 20:44.520
fixed on Sunday at that point in time with brand auto supply, which I had two weeks later.

20:45.460 --> 20:51.740
This makes no sense to me. I don't like it that these things happen. I have gone to great lengths

20:51.740 --> 21:01.960
to find good logical explanation for something that doesn't make any sense without a lot of

21:01.960 --> 21:07.100
heavy sugar. If indeed consciousness is the only thing that moves and everything else is fixed,

21:07.100 --> 21:11.680
and I'm just getting information from other parts of what is in essence one large feature,

21:11.940 --> 21:17.400
which in my sleep are available to me. That's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is

21:17.400 --> 21:22.500
just to step forward and backward arrow and you're bouncing around. But whatever it is, there's more

21:23.020 --> 21:37.080
going on in the space-time universe than we have been able to quantify mathematically. There's absolutely

21:37.080 --> 21:42.820
experiments that seem to prove the breakdown of ice and separability. If there's more work to back

21:42.820 --> 21:47.980
that up, then that would be very helpful for me and my personal quandary with these things. But

21:49.700 --> 21:57.640
it does it as an insoluble problem right now, so I tend to keep tackling it. And tackling it with

21:57.640 --> 22:05.100
Shabbat, who was really an ignorant child who took on a veneer of civilization but remained

22:05.660 --> 22:12.240
very primitive throughout, was a nice way to tackle it in the face of all the heavy abstract

22:12.240 --> 22:17.340
stuff. I mean, here's this character who is willing to admit that she doesn't understand the

22:17.340 --> 22:21.400
physics or the space-time manifolds, and if she turns on the cruiser and it goes, it's the same

22:21.400 --> 22:24.900
thing as, you know, I mean, a woman can't change the tire, doesn't know our engine work, but she

22:24.900 --> 22:37.260
can do it. I needed that character and the magic really to balance off the navigation stuff and

22:37.260 --> 22:40.640
the temporal stuff that was going on toward the end of the book.

22:46.100 --> 22:50.320
Okay, unfortunately, I haven't written which book this quote came from, but I have a little

22:50.320 --> 22:56.920
short quote I want to read to you from that and get your comment on it. This is talking about

22:56.920 --> 23:02.020
Shabbat and it says, she agreed with the Karrion position that fiction and fantasy were acid

23:02.020 --> 23:07.220
eating away at the substructure of society, that these could foster nothing but discontinued

23:07.220 --> 23:12.800
malaise. And then the paragraph goes on to say that basically the computers drove away music

23:12.800 --> 23:19.800
and poetry. So here we have the two sides conflicting. Have you resolved that conflict

23:19.800 --> 23:25.280
is really true or can it be resolved? I haven't had the conflict, that's a little joke. I have an

23:25.280 --> 23:34.060
element of sarcastic humor. It's something that I gave the culture. I really don't have any problem

23:34.060 --> 23:38.740
personally with that, but I think that some people do. So when I see something like that,

23:39.100 --> 23:46.100
I will take it to an extreme and put it in. And to me, it's just the form of, I mean, that's in

23:46.100 --> 23:51.680
the same part. And I guess that's an in dream dancer and it's right along there with the guy

23:51.680 --> 23:56.020
who went in the huge Pentagon type building and has been there for 150 years and never came out.

23:56.120 --> 24:00.480
And they kept seeing him, you know, right, right. So those are all the, in a sense, those are

24:01.180 --> 24:08.760
to be taken not too seriously. One gets playful every once in a while. But at the time, I was

24:10.280 --> 24:18.040
a little concerned with the degree at which editors in the field of which there are too few, right?

24:19.340 --> 24:27.040
I tended to want to control what the writers were doing. I mean, somebody asked me for an idea of

24:27.040 --> 24:33.200
what was going to go on in the rest of the books. And I wasn't about to give it to them because I

24:33.200 --> 24:36.500
don't think you should write almost at the same thing. You shouldn't write the same book,

24:36.500 --> 24:40.740
shouldn't tell the same story twice. And I want my first draft to be for everybody,

24:41.040 --> 24:44.160
rather than having to write it once for the editor and write it again for the public.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.340
As I said before, you run a risklier of leaving something out because you've already said it.

24:51.720 --> 24:56.300
I do believe in the freshness of the first draft and although I clean my drafts up and do,

24:56.440 --> 25:01.220
in essence, the second draft when I retie it, I try to keep as much as the original, whatever's

25:01.220 --> 25:13.740
good I keep. So we have a problem for the artist in this society and it's engendered by the people

25:13.740 --> 25:21.780
who are the middlemen who take your art and purvey it to a public who they do not respect.

25:23.540 --> 25:28.420
It's in the sales managers and the art directors and sometimes in the editors,

25:28.420 --> 25:33.140
if you have a good one, you don't feel it. I have a very good one right now and I'm very

25:33.140 --> 25:38.100
comfortable with that. I know writing for this particular editor that if I meet my own standards,

25:38.760 --> 25:42.480
this editor is going to love it and not going to give me any problem about it because it's an

25:42.480 --> 25:48.700
intelligent editor with a good understanding of science and a willingness to admit that she

25:48.700 --> 25:54.680
doesn't know when she doesn't know. I had an editor at one point that stood up, bought a little disc,

25:54.680 --> 25:58.000
based on red said, well, I never took high school science and I don't understand it and I don't

25:58.000 --> 26:01.700
think anybody else will either. Somebody like that should not be editing science fiction,

26:01.800 --> 26:08.540
they should be editing ladies romances. They really don't belong in this kind of field. I mean,

26:08.600 --> 26:16.620
I'm very protective of the right of someone who does this kind of work to experiment and to take

26:16.620 --> 26:23.940
shots. It really is the only free area where you can do it. Our avant-garde is not a viable commercial

26:23.940 --> 26:29.860
area in science fiction because its middle list is. And so you can please the publisher and also

26:29.860 --> 26:35.440
please yourself write something that has some validity that will get people to think. It's

26:35.440 --> 26:40.040
really important that people think for themselves. And here we have an open free society, the only

26:40.040 --> 26:46.480
one in the world in which the information that you're allowed to have is limited pretty much by

26:46.480 --> 26:52.120
your ability to collect information and nothing else. I mean, I had that particle

26:52.760 --> 26:57.200
being stuffed before it was declassified. You can get it if you really want to.

26:58.440 --> 27:03.580
Or you can get enough to know what's going on. There's some stuff that right now I imagine is

27:03.580 --> 27:08.780
pretty highly classified about an EMP defensive weapon. But if you know what EMP is and you know

27:08.780 --> 27:15.500
what it does, then you know what they're working on. We have this right to ask questions, to know

27:15.500 --> 27:20.140
and understand, to get the information here and we don't have it anywhere else. And yet we're

27:20.140 --> 27:28.460
subjected to a sort of censorship by mediocrity. And I don't like that. I think that the value

27:28.460 --> 27:34.580
really of our literature is to give information, to move these people, to get them thinking. And

27:34.580 --> 27:39.420
we get all these lots of science fiction read by kids in my school, bright kids like I was,

27:39.700 --> 27:44.100
where I haven't decided what they want to do yet. So I can move three or four kids to try and find

27:44.100 --> 27:48.920
the answers to those questions. And those kids go into technical fields and do something interesting

27:48.920 --> 27:54.440
and I've done something that I consider important. So in that way, I mean I was angry, but when I'm

27:54.440 --> 27:59.380
angry I make a little joke because I can't be crusader-rabbit and they're not going to change

27:59.380 --> 28:05.120
the world. And all I can do is change the world that I make. So I make a world and I have enough

28:05.120 --> 28:09.780
good things and bad things about it. And I run the characters through it and let them be human in it.

28:09.880 --> 28:14.640
And hopefully we all learn something. I mean they surprise me every once in a while. They come out a

28:14.640 --> 28:16.800
little better or a little worse than I thought that they were.

28:18.320 --> 28:25.240
All right. With regard to that two cultures thing, it's been my experience that scientists

28:25.240 --> 28:31.480
have a lot less trouble with the two cultures than people in the humanities. I mean I know a lot of

28:31.480 --> 28:36.740
scientists, me included, are very interested in philosophy and things like that. And I don't find

28:36.740 --> 28:42.760
a lot of humanities people who are that interested in science or care and are very antagonistic.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.020
And that's always puzzled me, which is why I wanted to ask you about that because I thought it

28:46.020 --> 28:55.320
might be a little bit of a humorous dig. Yeah. That bothers me. I get that too because there are

28:55.320 --> 29:02.000
a lot of so-called literary writers in science fiction, you know, enough of them, so that I have

29:02.000 --> 29:07.720
had run-ins with people who are writing science fiction for reasons that I don't, you know, to

29:07.720 --> 29:12.800
just to make social comment or just to allow themselves literary freedom. Stuff that seems to

29:12.800 --> 29:21.440
me totally valueless. And they come down on me very hard because in a sense, as we're threatened by

29:21.440 --> 29:28.840
the kind of work that I'm doing, they don't want to do that work. I think people with a strong

29:30.180 --> 29:34.740
technical background and who are comfortable with math and with the physical world, you can't

29:34.740 --> 29:42.340
understand the world if you don't understand physics. And to say that to someone isn't itself

29:42.340 --> 29:47.280
upsetting. And you've got a lot of people who grew up and got liberal arts degrees, and they're

29:47.280 --> 29:54.640
finding that it's not helping them with the real world and they're hostile. There's a technological

29:54.640 --> 30:01.960
backlash, which you must be aware of. And they want us if we're going to be technologically

30:01.960 --> 30:07.260
literate to stay out of their world. They don't want to hear about it. They want everybody who is

30:07.260 --> 30:11.180
comfortable with technology to have a very large head, very thick glasses, and stay in their room

30:11.180 --> 30:15.800
and touch a computer. They don't want them out in the world because they feel that the world is their

30:15.800 --> 30:21.960
place. And the sensibilities and the humanities that they're concerned with are somehow threatened by

30:22.900 --> 30:26.900
computers because they don't understand them, because mathematics, because they've never learned it.

30:26.900 --> 30:35.220
By anything, it's just the typical resistance to new things that people have. But I hate to name

30:35.220 --> 30:41.120
writers, but there are people that have good style that are writing science fiction. Who are not

30:41.120 --> 30:47.200
writing science fiction, they just happen to be writing and selling stuff as science fiction so

30:47.200 --> 30:51.320
that they can take advantage of the freedom without doing what I consider paying their dues.

30:51.320 --> 30:55.280
They don't know what they're talking about. They really do not. And they don't belong

30:57.640 --> 31:02.700
between cutters that say science fiction on them. And sometimes, unlike on the

31:02.700 --> 31:06.380
arborist camp, you know, I'm from the technical side, saying, why aren't these people doing any

31:06.380 --> 31:10.800
homework? And why don't they even attempt to understand the world? You can't understand

31:10.800 --> 31:15.660
philosophy at this point in time if you don't get into the mathematical philosophers.

31:16.220 --> 31:23.140
That's where it is. Geocronometry is lost. The philosophical questions of space and time

31:23.140 --> 31:29.320
are the questions in philosophy at this moment. Even 20 years ago was Grimvome and Wirtzell and

31:29.320 --> 31:34.060
those guys that was the leading edge. And so you get these people who are in the so-called

31:34.060 --> 31:41.020
humanities who are trying to live in the late 19th century now. And eventually, they're not going

31:41.020 --> 31:45.920
to be able to make a living doing that. You cannot exclude what is the most powerful society

31:45.920 --> 31:50.760
and still claim to be speaking for that society. You really got me going now. I'm going to

31:50.760 --> 31:57.460
stop. Great. I'm going to get me into a lot of trouble. We remember we had it, so we won't get

31:57.460 --> 32:04.060
you in trouble. My little rupture. Another thing I felt to be an inside joke, which I thoroughly

32:04.060 --> 32:10.580
enjoyed. Maybe it wasn't a joke, but Raphael Penrose, who was a descendant of the well-known

32:10.580 --> 32:17.380
to Roger Penrose, complete with this watch that got passed down. Is that factual? And do you

32:17.380 --> 32:22.360
know Penrose? How did you... I don't know him personally. He's my favorite of all the guys

32:22.360 --> 32:27.100
working in that area. I love Twisted Theory. He makes all the sense to me in the world.

32:27.980 --> 32:34.440
And I have read, assiduously, everything he has written. And the thing about the watch,

32:34.800 --> 32:41.000
Ashley came from... God, what is it? It's a symposium on general relativity. I think Cambridge

32:41.000 --> 32:48.120
published it in which he had a paper talking about particularly his watch. So I thought it would be

32:48.120 --> 32:53.400
a lot of fun to take his watch, but I was betting on him. I sat down and I said, okay, now who is

32:53.400 --> 33:01.680
going to be in 250 years? One guy that's alive today and working now is going to be still valid

33:01.680 --> 33:08.700
and important to that society. And he's my guest. I think that Twisted Theory has a good chance of

33:08.700 --> 33:17.960
proving to be 80% valid. I really like the fact that Twisters have to spend before they have

33:17.960 --> 33:22.540
anything else. And what it's a very complicated... If you're familiar with the concept, you know what

33:22.540 --> 33:27.740
I'm talking about. If not, this is no place to give you a short course on Roger Penwell.

33:27.860 --> 33:33.020
The honest... Yeah, I'm very interested in him as well and have enjoyed that theory,

33:33.100 --> 33:35.580
although I haven't seen much on it in the last year or so.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.120
Right. Well, I think this is a couple of years old. Well, they haven't been able...

33:39.120 --> 33:45.560
They got the basics down and I talked to somebody who is a mediocre physicist and also a science

33:45.560 --> 33:51.000
fiction writer who said an interesting thing to me, which was that I had to, one, he thought of it

33:51.000 --> 33:54.920
when he talked about it. And when I said, well, you know, if he's right, then we don't have anything

33:54.920 --> 33:59.540
left to do and we're all out of jobs. So part of the resistance to the kind of stuff he's publishing

34:00.940 --> 34:06.420
stems from the fact that it just might be that that structure is indeed a bottom line structure.

34:06.940 --> 34:11.940
And he's running into the sort of resistance within the community that everybody runs into,

34:12.100 --> 34:20.240
as they have an actual good idea, God forbid. So there's a sort of self-censorship within those

34:20.240 --> 34:25.500
guys too, but you're right. I haven't seen anything in the last year from him. Doesn't mean that the

34:25.500 --> 34:33.620
structure and what's going on there is any less valid. I could make you with the article I have

34:35.040 --> 34:39.600
from the St. Ken Nelson Post. And if you don't have that, you'd probably like to see it.

34:40.340 --> 34:45.700
Sure. If it's no problem. Well, I'll talk to you about it at the end, which, by the way, will come

34:45.700 --> 34:49.860
eventually don't. I don't have that many more questions. If you're still game, I am.

34:51.740 --> 35:00.780
Okay. Sheba referred to the universe in one of the books is an amenable universe, which I guess is

35:00.780 --> 35:07.740
another name for participatory or anthropomorphic. Basically the same philosophical principle as the

35:07.740 --> 35:11.340
one in Solistria. Okay.

35:13.440 --> 35:18.960
A little more. It was a little more quantum mechanical this time, I think than last time.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.500
And certainly a little more sophisticated, but basically the same kind of structure. And the

35:24.500 --> 35:28.960
amenable universe was found that is, again, if indeed they're giving us everything that we think about,

35:29.980 --> 35:35.720
if one is a co-creator, then as long as we keep delving into smaller and smaller degrees of particle

35:35.720 --> 35:41.840
physics, we will keep finding what we look for. But if twisters are what twisters are, then we found a bottom line.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.880
Now we're going to get into a kind of philosophical question.

35:50.160 --> 35:59.460
Both of the series have female protagonists and they are fully capable individuals. And yet they're

35:59.460 --> 36:05.660
not, I don't think they would make somebody who would be, let's say, a stereotypical feminist happy

36:05.720 --> 36:13.460
I mean. And I'm okay. Do you get feedback from that? And this seems to me realistic. It is post-liberation

36:13.460 --> 36:18.780
and it's why I enjoyed it. But do you get problems with people who maybe get a little PO'd because

36:19.420 --> 36:23.980
Estre gets beaten up and you point out that males and females may actually have

36:23.980 --> 36:27.900
different mathematical abilities and different intuitive abilities.

36:27.900 --> 36:35.400
Well, I have just, I have, you must have seen those studies on why women don't do well at math and

36:35.400 --> 36:43.300
take up math and computers. I'm not making this stuff up. I have a nice degree of facility in math

36:43.300 --> 36:48.400
and I also am good spatially. You know, I shoot well in my pinball right up there. One can develop

36:48.400 --> 36:53.200
these things. It may not be a genetic thing. It might be a conditioning thing. I can't say a lot.

36:53.200 --> 37:00.900
People are working on it, but it is a reality. As far as the rest of it, it's a problem

37:01.860 --> 37:08.700
for females in the age that is coming. If indeed it continues to be the case because without

37:09.360 --> 37:17.160
good technical facility, good math, willingness to deal with computers, there's going to be

37:17.160 --> 37:22.660
dinosaurs. And the same instrument. One can be equal to computer. If one masters the computer,

37:22.660 --> 37:27.540
there's no, there's a potential for real equality and intellectual equality. Now,

37:27.580 --> 37:33.640
this has never existed before, partly because menial labor and physical strength is no longer a great

37:33.640 --> 37:40.240
part of what makes one a functional human being in society and partly because of the concerns of

37:40.240 --> 37:47.520
the society itself. It is not going to happen if women don't start doing their own work in the

37:47.520 --> 37:52.880
areas involved and getting their facility up there. And if I can do it, the rest of them can do it.

37:53.460 --> 37:58.900
There's no reason why anyone should be in a self-inflicted ghetto.

38:01.840 --> 38:08.440
I'd really like to see ladies spending more time trying to become

38:08.440 --> 38:14.820
premier in their field the way a guy has to. I mean, it's a responsibility that one takes on

38:14.820 --> 38:19.680
very early in life. I am going to be successful at something specific besides childbearing.

38:20.100 --> 38:25.720
Not that childbearing is in a nice part of life, but there definitely is more. And I find the

38:27.240 --> 38:33.040
ERA thing very embarrassing. People assume that I am a feminist. And I really don't want to be

38:33.040 --> 38:37.160
associated with a bunch of ladies standing out in the middle of the street screaming for their rights.

38:37.800 --> 38:43.400
It's just not me. I'm not comfortable with them. I don't agree with them. I don't like over

38:43.400 --> 38:50.260
simplification. I don't believe that conditioning is a great part of what makes a person what they

38:50.260 --> 38:53.920
are or that the fact that if you're a little girl and you don't have pockets in your pants,

38:54.060 --> 39:02.100
you're doomed. I don't believe it. A great degree of it is genetic inheritance, but one does have

39:02.100 --> 39:08.020
control over one's own faith. Intelligence will go where you point it. And there are plenty of

39:08.020 --> 39:12.400
intelligent women out there. I'd like to see them do something with that intelligence.

39:14.080 --> 39:20.320
In a sense, I suppose I was throwing the gauntlet, but at times it annoys me. I've ended up on

39:20.320 --> 39:26.980
panels before I knew better at conventions where I look around me and everyone else in that panel

39:26.980 --> 39:32.500
is a woman and someone has put me in a ghetto. And invariably, they all write fantasy or they all

39:32.500 --> 39:38.960
write very light science fiction. And nobody is writing the shortest thing that I'm writing,

39:39.060 --> 39:42.700
and nobody is interested in talking about what I'm interested in talking about. I was at one

39:42.700 --> 39:47.440
where the moderators said, oh, isn't this wonderful? We're all ladies. We'll have a conscious

39:47.440 --> 39:54.180
situation raising fashion. And I just went under the table. It's just not my style. It's not what

39:54.180 --> 40:00.620
I'm interested in. It's not what I'm comfortable with. And I don't even mind if large groups of

40:00.620 --> 40:05.840
females want to organize for their rights, although the Constitution does not guarantee any right,

40:05.900 --> 40:13.460
except the right to struggle to succeed. Nobody's given you the right to have anything gratis

40:13.460 --> 40:21.540
in America, just to try to get it. But they're not speaking for me. And I'm sure they're not

40:21.540 --> 40:26.400
speaking for a large number of perfectly competent, happy females who are doing what they're doing

40:26.400 --> 40:32.760
and have a specific goal, which is not political, i.e., to work in the field, to do good work,

40:33.040 --> 40:41.700
to create a corpus of body, of intellectual work, or technical work, or any other kind of work that

40:41.700 --> 40:50.420
is satisfying. These characters, astray in the positive way and Shabbat almost in a negative way,

40:52.760 --> 41:00.120
do their best to succeed at something. Shabbat, because she's unfocused, has more of the problems

41:00.120 --> 41:04.940
of current day females than astray actually. Astray had more difficult situations to deal with,

41:05.320 --> 41:11.620
but a much simpler society really to deal with it in. And Shabbat in the end opted for what I

41:11.620 --> 41:18.300
considered the best option for her, which was her cruiser, and study, and growing as a person,

41:18.300 --> 41:23.300
which for me was what was necessary for that character to have. And I got letters from people

41:23.300 --> 41:27.140
who said that they cried at the end. I didn't think it was sad. I thought it was a good idea.

41:27.640 --> 41:32.460
But she went off with her cruiser, which is what indeed a pilot is supposed to do, regardless of

41:32.460 --> 41:39.500
sex. And I was very surprised to get a letter like that from a recently intelligent person

41:39.500 --> 41:43.740
who I actually knew. I mean, I knew it wasn't just a letter from a strange fan, it was a letter

41:44.300 --> 41:52.080
from a person I had met, because the reader had put so much of her own values into the story

41:52.680 --> 41:57.020
that the ending was a different experience for her than it was for me to write her. That doesn't

41:57.020 --> 42:02.680
usually happen. Usually they get what I want them to get. And in this case, it didn't have

42:03.580 --> 42:08.600
the values of the person reading it was so different from the values of the character

42:08.600 --> 42:13.980
that it made the reader cry. And although I don't think that's bad, you know, it doesn't

42:13.980 --> 42:19.500
mean that I failed as a writer. I think it says something about the reader. You're going to get

42:19.500 --> 42:24.500
a certain number of readers that way. I've had problems with ultra feminist readers

42:26.080 --> 42:31.260
at conventions in minor ways in the beginning, but mostly from the guys. The women don't

42:31.260 --> 42:38.740
wouldn't read it originally because of the covers and because of subject matter. I'm not going to

42:38.740 --> 42:44.140
again, it's other women writers. I mean, the obvious ones are going to say things to you, the gay ones,

42:46.220 --> 42:53.140
the ones who are very small and kind of mousy and really don't have any background in male-female

42:53.140 --> 42:58.900
relations to speak of will have the reactions that those kinds of people will have when confronted

42:58.900 --> 43:04.100
with a book like that. But the reactions that surprise me were the ones from guys who would

43:04.100 --> 43:09.880
kind of give me a, you know, snicker and try to pat my butt. That's the first thing.

43:11.460 --> 43:16.840
So it's a problem right now, but I don't think most of the people that I know have no

43:17.380 --> 43:21.440
problems within their own sexuality. They just are concerned with the world's sexuality.

43:22.480 --> 43:28.680
And as long as each group of two people get it together, then the world will take care of

43:28.680 --> 43:36.500
itself in this end. We in general will continue as a race, but because of my familiarity with

43:36.500 --> 43:42.860
politics, I'm very aware of how many people find it possible to make a living in this or that

43:42.860 --> 43:48.040
nonprofit organization doing virtually nothing but talking. And there's a great deal of that in

43:48.040 --> 43:58.660
the women's movement. Okay, here, here. I like that. Okay, I've got two more questions. We're
