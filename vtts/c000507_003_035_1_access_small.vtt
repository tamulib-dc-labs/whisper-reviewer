00:01.620 --> 00:06.860
Ask you a few questions about background, maybe a few general questions about your fiction.

00:07.400 --> 00:07.760
Alright.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.360
And then some specific ones about, you know, specific books and so forth.

00:11.960 --> 00:12.300
Alright.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.400
Okay, David, have we got the tape rolling?

00:15.620 --> 00:16.260
We've got the tape rolling.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.640
Okay, listen, if you can, I am getting a bad feedback if you can find a bad echo.

00:21.260 --> 00:22.160
I can hardly hear my voice.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.100
Let me see.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.460
Hello, test, test.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.400
Well, hello yourself, test.

00:31.340 --> 00:32.220
Ah, let's see.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.480
Try that and see if that's a little better.

00:37.520 --> 00:37.840
Okay.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.480
Testing one, two, yeah, okay, that'll work.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.840
As long as it's voice, you got the tape rolling?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.700
Yeah, make sure you hit the yellow button whenever it stops.

00:46.640 --> 00:46.700
Okay.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.540
Alright, you ready?

00:47.780 --> 00:48.100
Okay.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.120
Okay, tape is rolling.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.360
Like I said before, you know, we edit this, so if you say something you want to take back

00:52.360 --> 00:54.380
or I'd ask a dumb question, just stop me.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.340
I'm not okay.

00:55.340 --> 01:01.280
Okay, one thing I had problem with, I wasn't able to find anything of use to me on your

01:01.280 --> 01:06.280
background, exclusive of writing, just, you know, what you do, what you, you know, just

01:06.280 --> 01:07.220
anything about background.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.680
Could you just give me a brief statement on that?

01:08.940 --> 01:10.360
Well, let's see.

01:11.740 --> 01:18.300
Up until about the age 14, I lived in Austin, Austin, Texas.

01:19.020 --> 01:19.700
Loved it.

01:21.620 --> 01:29.000
I began to enjoy taking trips with my parents once or twice a year or something up into

01:29.000 --> 01:30.820
the mountains, say, in New Mexico, mainly.

01:31.880 --> 01:38.860
By the time I was 15, I had moved to Lubbock, finished high school there, because I was

01:39.640 --> 01:41.820
a couple of years younger than everybody else.

01:42.240 --> 01:47.780
When I got into the football program, it was more or less four-hour day in that I was going

01:47.780 --> 01:48.580
to lose a few teeth.

01:48.580 --> 01:53.820
You know, you don't have a linebacker two years younger than everybody else without

01:53.820 --> 01:55.640
him losing a few parts on the way.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.880
Tended to make me rather aggressive.

01:59.560 --> 02:06.260
Anyway, I graduated 16, took a year at Texas Tech, then almost flunked out actually.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.560
I was, I think, not ready, I think, for college.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.900
I was going in as a chemical engineer.

02:13.160 --> 02:23.240
I changed majors and went to Fort Worth at TCU another year and a half there as a speech

02:24.060 --> 02:27.540
student and began to do scripts then.

02:28.260 --> 02:34.660
At that time, I had a fairly good idea that I would be able to write, and I was playing

02:34.660 --> 02:35.760
with writing at the time.

02:35.760 --> 02:46.360
I went into the Air Force in TCU and spent four years from 51 to early 55 at various places

02:46.360 --> 02:47.020
around the country.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.740
You know, I didn't get shipped overseas.

02:51.420 --> 03:01.180
When I came to California, I finally got a degree in radio speech, direction, and writing.

03:02.340 --> 03:08.360
For some strange reason, decided not to do anything with that immediately, but went into

03:08.360 --> 03:09.320
aerospace engineering.

03:10.180 --> 03:18.180
And for the next 15 years, I rose to a not very exciting position, but it was senior

03:18.180 --> 03:21.060
research engineer, even though I had a speech degree.

03:22.640 --> 03:31.360
And for the time I was, I was, I was about 1967 or 1968, I was deciding several things

03:31.360 --> 03:32.640
about the aerospace industry.

03:32.880 --> 03:44.020
They were really making up at the expense of the, of the ingenious.

03:44.420 --> 03:49.400
Let's say the people that had the ideas were rarely treated all that well.

03:49.400 --> 03:56.220
And the managers were the ones who got close to the benefit of all those ideas.

03:57.500 --> 04:06.500
So I quit doing design work and simply did it in my own home, went back for a master's

04:06.500 --> 04:11.500
degree at San Jose State while I was still a field energy engineer.

04:12.340 --> 04:17.800
And at the same time, I built and raised a couple of cars, post car types.

04:20.700 --> 04:27.040
Then I decided to go ahead and get a doctorate at the University of Oregon, left California.

04:28.180 --> 04:33.700
Since then, that's about 12 years ago, and then I got the doctorate for the top 15 years

04:33.700 --> 04:35.640
that has dreadful did yet to be a doctorate.

04:37.840 --> 04:45.920
So I came back to the West Coast and found that I could teach, say whatever it is I need to say

04:48.000 --> 04:55.160
without anyone, without having to answer to any administrator, so long as I give a bang

04:55.160 --> 04:56.720
up good yarn in the process.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.200
So there's your thumbnail history.

05:01.240 --> 05:01.680
Good.

05:01.880 --> 05:02.080
Okay.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.060
By the way, at the ends of your answers, I'm probably going to pause a little bit to make

05:06.060 --> 05:06.620
sure you're done.

05:06.860 --> 05:07.920
It doesn't mean I'm not listening.

05:08.180 --> 05:08.520
I understood.

05:09.020 --> 05:09.460
Okay.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.120
Listen, did you read science fiction as a youngster?

05:12.220 --> 05:15.820
I read a little science fiction when I was a kid.

05:15.980 --> 05:27.440
I recall my granddad switching off with his old pulp, instant pulp magazine with other railroad

05:27.440 --> 05:33.000
engineers and Breitman and so on, and I would occasionally read some of the pulp magazines

05:33.000 --> 05:33.540
in there.

05:35.360 --> 05:44.680
Then when I was about, oh, I suppose, 12 years old, I discovered timeline and a couple of

05:44.680 --> 05:50.920
other science fiction writers that I really did enjoy, and off and on, through my high

05:50.920 --> 05:54.380
school years, I would read science fiction.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.720
Oh, what is now analog?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.060
It used to be called astounding.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.980
I would read that and not much else.

06:02.960 --> 06:09.740
But by the time I was a college freshman and wanted to get into the sciences and engineering,

06:10.700 --> 06:15.680
I was what you could call a, you know, a modest fan of science fiction.

06:17.580 --> 06:18.020
Okay.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.440
You weren't the type then that was a fanatic and put out your own fanzine and went to conventions

06:22.440 --> 06:23.060
and so forth.

06:24.020 --> 06:28.180
The first, oh, no, I was never really a fan.

06:28.840 --> 06:37.200
The first science fiction convention I ever went to, a man named Mark Clifton who had just

06:37.200 --> 06:38.740
won the first Hugo, I believe.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.260
He was about the only man I knew who was a writer.

06:44.260 --> 06:51.760
And I had already had a couple of stories sold to astounding, now analog maybe.

06:52.760 --> 06:58.360
And Mark asked me to come along to a Worldcon which happened to be in Southern California

06:58.360 --> 06:58.860
at the time.

07:00.520 --> 07:12.220
I went, I kind of enjoyed it, but I didn't really make any contact and I did go on with

07:12.220 --> 07:12.940
it for very long.

07:12.940 --> 07:19.980
I simply quit writing science fiction and went back to doing engineering, design and

07:19.980 --> 07:21.920
so forth for years and years.

07:22.760 --> 07:27.680
I perceived that there were problems that I liked to, you know, social and technological

07:27.680 --> 07:35.420
problems that I liked to address more immediately than I could address them in science fiction.

07:35.420 --> 07:43.840
It wasn't until some years later that I realized that I had almost nothing to say about what

07:43.840 --> 07:47.400
was done with my ability.

07:48.160 --> 07:55.600
Whatever ingenuity I might have was not going to be used as I chose but as the administration

07:55.600 --> 08:01.180
chose, as long as I worked for some large company.

08:01.180 --> 08:08.940
And so I got more and more out of that, did more and more design work, development of

08:09.720 --> 08:12.500
all kinds of notions in my home lab.

08:13.260 --> 08:20.580
Not just building racing cars but developing the fiberglass rivet technique, developing

08:20.580 --> 08:28.800
a multi-manometric gauge gadget that you could put on a prototype automobile.

08:30.660 --> 08:39.780
And drive the car at various speeds on a freeway and get wind tunnel data from it.

08:40.380 --> 08:41.340
Things like that.

08:42.340 --> 08:49.800
I simply wanted to do it and I never had much opportunity to get anything out of it through

08:50.360 --> 08:51.600
the industries that I worked in.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.920
So I decided to head for those guys.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.760
I would do all my work on my own.

08:59.540 --> 09:04.280
Okay, listen, the source is available to me.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.120
I don't think I know about those early stories of yours, those early ones for astounding.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.660
What year are you talking about?

09:10.920 --> 09:11.720
Let's see.

09:12.340 --> 09:16.080
My first published story was early in 1955.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.300
I wrote it in 1954.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.940
It was called Type-Squeed.

09:21.960 --> 09:29.360
And I know it's in some old compilations of stories back in the 50s.

09:29.640 --> 09:39.980
And about a year and a half later, I guess the summer of 1956, I had one published that is called Red Rover.

09:41.560 --> 09:48.040
Now, Red Rover has been reprinted in an anthology about two years ago.

09:48.940 --> 09:54.600
But Type-Squeed, I believe, has ever been reprinted, which is not too surprising as a story.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.600
He doesn't know all that good.

09:57.100 --> 10:07.260
As a suggestion of the kinds of problems that a mechanic was liable to have in freefall working in an orbital situation,

10:08.020 --> 10:11.340
it was, I think, a pretty good story.

10:13.900 --> 10:19.900
So let's say that it was good as a technological flip note, but it was not particularly good as a story.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.760
And that was in 1955-1966.

10:24.040 --> 10:33.380
I quit writing then for almost 20 years because I had sent another story, which was clearly a fake piece,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.080
clearly a complaint about the way we were centralizing in bigger and bigger cities.

10:39.080 --> 10:48.980
The story I wrote, which I can even recall the name of now, it was turned down by Horace Gould at Gallicry.

10:49.440 --> 10:55.320
And Horace's scribbled complaint to me was that it was a terrific storytelling, but not much of a story.

10:55.920 --> 11:04.540
That I was, it was perfectly clear that I was up on the soapbox, wranging the reader.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.680
And Horace was just entertaining. That's all he wanted. Well, that made me mad.

11:09.880 --> 11:15.760
I didn't think that my particular position in life was as an entertainer.

11:17.040 --> 11:24.900
And I realized if I couldn't make the things that I had to say interesting enough so that I could entertain and inform at the same time,

11:25.020 --> 11:30.420
then I wouldn't write. And that's the truth. I couldn't. I didn't know the class that well at the time.

11:30.420 --> 11:41.080
I could either entertain you or I could write some information down. I could write some information down and hold it.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.220
Just a minute there, I'll think about this and rephrase it.

11:45.220 --> 11:45.920
Fine.

11:51.080 --> 12:01.280
I could either entertain you and give the reader what he wanted and not do anything I wanted to do,

12:01.480 --> 12:07.220
or I could try to inform the reader and satisfy myself and not give the reader what he wanted.

12:08.420 --> 12:16.080
That is not a very good way to do it. Let's face it, the reader is the one who must be satisfied first.

12:16.380 --> 12:20.760
He's the person who pays his money for the entertainment.

12:22.380 --> 12:28.300
So I need to entertain about 90% first and inform no more than 10%.

12:30.740 --> 12:34.300
Okay, good. You anticipated one of my next questions anyhow with that one. That was good.

12:36.220 --> 12:41.800
Much of your fiction, at least your later fiction, is set in the late 1980s, 1990s.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.340
And I wonder why you're picking that time period so much.

12:45.780 --> 12:51.680
I think that the 80s and 90s give me a whole lot more clarity.

12:52.200 --> 13:01.180
It's really tough to see what's going on, to have much of a clear vision as to what's going to happen 30 to 40 years from now.

13:02.340 --> 13:12.560
I have, oh, the 1950s. I've had some fairly clear notions as to what the future would hold,

13:12.680 --> 13:14.920
and I have a pretty good batting average on that.

13:15.540 --> 13:26.760
Just for one example, to look at my very short and not very important career in sports car racing,

13:26.760 --> 13:33.480
I quit after two or three years and wrote some letters, open letters to editors and so on,

13:33.540 --> 13:40.060
of the racing fraternity saying that our overuse of gasoline and this waste of energy

13:40.060 --> 13:44.500
was really not in the best interest of the human race, and we were all going to be sorry for it.

13:44.720 --> 13:54.200
This was in 1961 and 62, and I set about trying to demonstrate how much better machines we could have than we did have.

13:54.200 --> 14:04.040
Well, because I built one of them is out in my garage right now, it looks like next year's bullshit, and it's 20 years old.

14:06.140 --> 14:15.120
My perceptions of what was going to happen 15, 20, 25 years in the future have been fairly good,

14:15.420 --> 14:20.540
and I would rather write about things that I feel more firmly familiar with.

14:21.040 --> 14:26.040
It's just awfully hard for me to figure out what's going to happen in the year 2010, let's say.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.400
However, I am working on it.

14:30.500 --> 14:37.180
Okay, all of your stories, it seems to me, your novels, novellas, whatever, they're all built around a very strong subject or theme,

14:37.240 --> 14:44.220
such things as the media or terrorism or nuclear war and so forth, and I wondered which comes first when you start a book.

14:44.220 --> 14:51.180
Does the subject come first and then you look for characters and then silence so forth, or do the characters come, or how do you go about it?

14:51.440 --> 14:56.220
I've hit it the first time, Dale. It is the theme usually that comes first.

14:57.020 --> 15:06.480
I have on occasion, sometimes just as an exercise, or sometimes just for fun, or because a friend will ask me to do so.

15:06.480 --> 15:17.680
There is an anthology that Larry Niven did based on his book called The Magic Goes Away, and I don't do much fantasy,

15:19.200 --> 15:28.260
but Larry's fantasy was a very clever one, a very good one, he even had a sense of scientific basis for magic,

15:28.260 --> 15:38.200
and he asked me to do a story for a sequel, and I was very happy to do that,

15:39.540 --> 15:47.400
but it's one of the few stories that I've written that I wish I did not have what I consider an important theme to start with.

15:47.800 --> 15:56.000
So as you first suggested, yes, I'll usually take a theme, then build plot and characters that go along with it.

15:58.780 --> 16:03.520
Okay, good. I was surprised what you said about Horace Gold's comment on that story,

16:03.600 --> 16:08.260
because my impression of your writing is that it's extremely fast-paced and exciting.

16:08.420 --> 16:11.660
When I pick up one of your books, I can hardly put it down until it's done,

16:12.200 --> 16:18.160
and I wondered if that skill or that file, whatever, is something you've acquired or worked at, or does it come naturally to you?

16:18.400 --> 16:21.640
I worked my buns off to get it, actually, Harold.

16:21.640 --> 16:27.040
You've got to remember that I did get my doctorate in communication theory,

16:27.680 --> 16:32.820
and media theory is a fairly good-sized flood of that,

16:33.480 --> 16:39.060
and studying men like William Stevenson and his clay theory of magic communication,

16:39.260 --> 16:49.400
taught me a lot about the kind of entertainment that an audience is liable to focus on.

16:51.140 --> 16:56.340
So, again, as you said, it's something that I had to work at.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.320
It didn't just come naturally. In fact, it still doesn't just come naturally.

17:01.580 --> 17:06.800
I have to sometimes go back and say, wait a minute, this is what I was wanting to say,

17:06.940 --> 17:08.700
but my God, nobody would be interested.

17:09.440 --> 17:14.960
So, now I've got to go back and figure a way to make it interesting.

17:16.200 --> 17:22.480
If I can do that 90% or 95% entertainment in a story,

17:22.880 --> 17:25.200
I know I can get away with putting in 5% message.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.500
Okay, that's a good proportion, it works, I think.

17:30.120 --> 17:30.740
Yeah, it does.

17:32.140 --> 17:35.160
However, there is a book just about to come out,

17:35.240 --> 17:37.780
in fact, it should be out by the time this tape is out.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.160
It's called Pulling Clues,

17:40.160 --> 17:48.340
and that is a novel in which I must have 20% information in there and only 80% entertainment.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.760
But it is, again, extremely fat-paced.

17:52.480 --> 18:08.000
I set a nuclear survival scenario in the context of a great big overbearing and overwhelming bounty hunter in California.

18:08.780 --> 18:15.620
A guy who goes around with weapons all the time and has a very high-tech environment.

18:15.980 --> 18:20.500
He's a man around whom things just happen and they happen fast.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.200
But the book is probably 20% information.

18:26.460 --> 18:32.200
It's, I guess, the most thoroughly information-packed novel I've ever written.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.900
And the reviews that are just coming out are very nice reviews,

18:37.040 --> 18:40.740
and so far I haven't heard anybody complain that it's dull.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.620
But that is, I think, the biggest risk I take.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.280
Yeah, I knew that book was coming out, pulling through.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.120
I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a copy of that.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.940
By any chance, that's not a sequel with a Contra line of desert for Systemic Shop.

18:53.240 --> 19:01.180
Pulling Through is a short novel on nuclear survival in the San Francisco Bay Area.

19:02.200 --> 19:07.200
And the short novel is followed in the same book by five articles,

19:07.880 --> 19:13.040
nonfiction articles detailing some of the gadgetry and techniques that these people use to stay alive.

19:13.440 --> 19:22.420
So that it is not only a fast-paced short novel, but it is also a manual of nuclear survival.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.200
All that in a single paperback.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.440
Good. I'll be waiting to get my hands on one of those.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.700
I knew it was coming. I just haven't been able to find a copy.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.280
Well, I haven't seen one yet either, Darrell.

19:35.360 --> 19:39.520
It's probably maybe two weeks in the future before it'll get to the stand.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.820
Yeah, okay. Let me focus down on some particular works then.

19:44.400 --> 19:44.740
All right.

19:44.940 --> 19:47.440
What was the impetus behind Anasazi?

19:49.560 --> 19:59.460
Well, for many years, I've been interested in American, North American, and Central American archaeology and anthropology.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.120
My master's degree was in American Indian Scientology.

20:05.320 --> 20:22.820
I had been in the Anasazi area numerous times and was aware of this mystery that still exists as to why those people moved down to the Anasazi.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.060
I should be more specific.

20:25.380 --> 20:35.860
The mystery as to why the American Indians who lived near the cliff dwellings, why they moved down under those cliffs and made those cliff dwellings to begin with.

20:36.440 --> 20:45.820
We know why they left, why they abandoned the cliff dwellings because of a great drought that was starving the knobs for 25 years or so.

20:45.820 --> 20:58.340
We know about the unbroken tradition of life in that area for centuries and centuries before they built the cliff dwellings.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.700
We still do not know.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.260
We do not know today why they built those dwellings themselves.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.540
It would seem, well, perhaps they were afraid of something.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.560
They were retreating from something.

21:10.560 --> 21:16.800
Yet we have no significant information as to what they were retreating from.

21:18.380 --> 21:34.920
Well, it was my idea to set up a scenario that would explain why these people abandoned their homes or accessible places upon top of the maces and moved down into a sort of dissimilar fortification.

21:37.200 --> 22:04.900
Since I enjoy visiting that part of the country, you know, like the Ziyua Pueblo, Akama, Mesa Verde, East Slater, Sanova Fonsil, Santa Clara, all the Pueblos in that area, I enjoy it a lot and this gave me a chance to do, to refamiliarize myself with some research, to go back to the area and write a book.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.560
A story that tied in so completely with facts.

22:11.180 --> 22:22.400
Facts that archaeologists already know that it might be a little hard sometimes, or say, undergrad students to decide which is back and which is fiction.

22:24.660 --> 22:32.540
Okay, you mentioned to me once before when I talked to you last time that there were some things you had in that book that hadn't even been come out yet.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.140
Is there some kind of research you did that hadn't even been noticed by anybody or something?

22:37.340 --> 22:43.240
Well, some of that was research that a friend of mine had done. He's an anthropologist.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.740
It was not that nobody had done it. It was that it hadn't been published yet.

22:47.340 --> 22:52.800
A friend of mine who was doing his doctoral dissertation on witchcraft, which was in Pueblo.

22:55.340 --> 23:01.060
And I was aware of all this and I had access to his tape recording.

23:02.100 --> 23:10.240
And while he was studying about the early stages of his doctoral dissertation, I was already reading those tapes, making notes and so on.

23:10.240 --> 23:21.020
So the book, Anasazi, which came out before his dissertation did, had information that was not in the literature yet.

23:21.420 --> 23:28.060
What it amounted to was that I had tomorrow morning's newspaper and when you have tomorrow morning's newspaper, you always seem smarter than you are.

23:30.020 --> 23:30.760
Okay, good.

23:32.780 --> 23:40.220
In one way, this work was different from most of your other later writing in that it had the aliens in it, the alien menace theme.

23:40.260 --> 23:43.080
And I guess an old stand by a science fiction about that monster thing.

23:43.200 --> 23:43.580
Oh, yeah.

23:43.820 --> 23:51.880
Was that just the plot device to explain the Anasazi problem or was it something you just deliberately chose for some other reason?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.380
I'm not sure how to answer that, Bill.

23:57.180 --> 24:11.040
They were the most likely answer, I could think of, to make it a horror story about a kind of possession that would possess American Indian kids

24:11.040 --> 24:22.120
and turn this thing from a science fiction western detective love story into a science fiction western love horror story.

24:22.720 --> 24:27.040
I wanted to try to do just about everything in a very short novel.

24:27.200 --> 24:36.620
It was an exercise in part to see how many kinds of a story I could write without making it seem jumbled.

24:37.760 --> 24:51.560
I couldn't think of anything more logical than to build upon very obviously Al Climans story, needle.

24:52.420 --> 24:57.860
If you remember, Al Climans wrote the story about a blob-like creature that lives within a human host.

24:58.740 --> 25:02.100
And Robert Heinlein's story is a puppet master.

25:03.020 --> 25:06.240
Now, let's see.

25:06.440 --> 25:14.260
I'm fairly sure that Al Climans did his first write and Heinlein's story was next.

25:16.180 --> 25:27.660
And I decided that if I was going to leapfrog on the marvelous creatures they had invented, the least I could do was to take it a bit further.

25:27.660 --> 25:34.720
If I didn't take it a bit further, I was really only listing ideas.

25:36.120 --> 25:47.740
So I used these horrific creatures and took their psychology a bit further than I thought previous authors had done that.

25:50.820 --> 26:00.260
What? Okay, at the end of the edition I have, I don't know if you have what you call a post-ludy which indicates maybe some kind of sequel.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.080
Have you planned anything in that area?

26:02.940 --> 26:06.820
No, the post-ludy is really just a Latin phrase for aftergate.

26:06.820 --> 26:23.680
Rather than talking about work to come, I'm talking to the readers really about playing with ideas about the characters and settings after the story is over.

26:25.400 --> 26:38.900
So my post-ludy were really simply little devices to ask the reader to create his own story based on what they just finished.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.780
I thought it would be a lot of fun for the reader.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.160
I don't intend to write those stories myself.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.200
Yeah, well it's fine. I got me to thinking. That's why I mentioned it.

26:51.260 --> 27:02.300
One thing that's always kept me fascinated in your work is the way you extrapolate some of your stories to me at least are pretty strictly extrapolated from present technology and ideas.

27:02.680 --> 27:14.640
You're right, really.

27:14.640 --> 27:20.100
I would show another area simply because I am, as you say, statistically extrapolate.

27:22.620 --> 27:28.120
Yeah, and one story in particular, I'm not sure if this was extrapolated or not. That's why I was going to ask about it.

27:29.400 --> 27:34.300
The story that was included with Anasazi in the latest edition of it, the portions of this program.

27:34.640 --> 27:34.980
Right.

27:35.140 --> 27:40.340
This idea of precognition or something. Is that possible? Are there studies in this area that you are working with?

27:41.540 --> 27:52.440
I actually developed that idea based on some term papers that a couple of young women had sent in to me.

27:53.000 --> 28:06.060
Even though the university where I taught back in the Midwest was pretty repressive on me, the working with the students was really marvelous.

28:06.850 --> 28:14.640
I encouraged them to go beyond where we had been going in a psychological and risk-eq class, for example.

28:15.980 --> 28:16.500
And they did.

28:17.440 --> 28:32.800
And two of those papers scourged the idea of certain chemical therapies that would help solve certain problems like infant schizophrenia.

28:34.100 --> 28:55.100
And since the young women's papers did go beyond what I knew, I started checking back and reading all of their footnotes, citations, and found what sounded to me like a possibility for curing certain kinds of autistic behavior.

28:57.060 --> 29:14.780
Well, I had to just drive in me to see if I couldn't get this scenario of mine with hypothesis studied by people who worked all the time with speech pathology.

29:14.780 --> 29:23.800
Well, I talked to a speech pathologist who said, yes, this is a very possible hypothesis, and they'd very well be true.

29:24.320 --> 29:31.660
But of course, I haven't got time to do it, and of course, you're not a pathologist, so you could never get published in any little quarterly journals anyway.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.460
So, he honestly, we're not going to ever have anything done about this.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.640
And I said the hell it won't, there.

29:39.020 --> 30:04.440
Wrote a style fiction story giving chapter and verse in the story about the real research that had been done back in the 60s, so that if anyone who deals with pathological communication happens to notice that those very real citations are not true,

30:04.460 --> 30:05.320
they're not true.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.320
It's a nice, fair, new research, and apparently it did.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.460
Yeah, I figured those were actual references.

30:13.940 --> 30:14.920
Yes, you're right.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.020
Listen, there was one thing you did in that story, which to me was very un-ing-like.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.760
I hadn't noticed this in any of your other work.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.400
Un-ing-like, well, that's a meaning.

30:22.940 --> 30:24.120
You almost have it.

30:24.180 --> 30:28.780
Well, it seems to be a possibility of time travel with that guy Fox who comes in there.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.620
Ah, you mean that that in does not do much in time travel.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.380
Yeah, you're right.

30:34.520 --> 30:49.180
I usually don't because it has never seemed to me that it is a very sensible, it's still paradoxical, that I think it might very well be impossible.

30:50.100 --> 30:59.640
You know, a few things may very well be permanently impossible and time travel, well, I don't happen to be a believer in time travel, that's all.

30:59.640 --> 31:07.460
I have no, I don't think I could say I'm certain it can't happen, of course not.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.000
But it's just not one of those things that I consider all that likely.

31:11.440 --> 31:17.560
However, I'm certainly not above giving a hint of it once in a while.

31:18.280 --> 31:25.240
But you're right though, as a general rule it is a kind of un-ing-like piece of a plot.

31:26.260 --> 31:31.120
However, maybe next year or year after that I may decide to play with it.

31:32.140 --> 31:40.980
Yeah, there have been some, I thought some excellent novels written recently on time travel, Hogan's Twice Upon a Time and what's the Timescape I guess by Benford?

31:40.980 --> 31:45.360
Benford's Timescape, I was just really fascinated by that.

31:45.720 --> 31:53.540
The alternate worlds make a lot of sense, well, I should say, seen to me to make a kind of theoretical sense.

31:54.100 --> 31:58.820
And I can do it with alternate worlds a little better.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.620
It's hard for me to write a thing which I don't believe.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.300
That's one of the reasons why I don't do fantasy very much.

32:06.160 --> 32:12.020
Okay, what about the story, the devil you don't know? Where did your interest in middle institutions come from?

32:12.660 --> 32:26.200
Again, that was a story, not a story, it was a paper by a student of mine that discussed the dreadful conditions in some middle institutions.

32:26.200 --> 32:35.600
This is back in the early to mid-70s when this young woman handed me this paper.

32:36.300 --> 32:50.780
And I was really appalled and by doing some checking I found that she was right in every respect and I thought it was time that someone did some fiction along that line

32:50.780 --> 33:05.380
to point out the possibilities for, to point out how likely it was that some middle institutions were being really mishandled

33:05.380 --> 33:11.980
that the patients were being mal-treated, that nothing very fruitful was going to ever come out of them.

33:12.860 --> 33:13.720
And so I wrote the story.

33:15.560 --> 33:20.720
In that story of course you write about, I'm not sure the pronunciation, is it mafe, Chris mafe?

33:21.280 --> 33:21.860
Yeah, mafe.

33:22.300 --> 33:28.040
Okay, your characters are so real to me that I can't help but think that they're being modeled on real people.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.760
I wonder if that's true.

33:30.500 --> 33:34.980
No, actually mafe is much a creature of whole cloth of anybody.

33:35.920 --> 33:44.980
There are of course partial patches of people that I crammed together to make characters.

33:45.840 --> 33:56.780
I have noticed, oh in academia, that while of course I value academic life quite a bit.

33:56.920 --> 34:02.580
I certainly not have tried to take it on about the age 40 if I didn't value it a lot.

34:02.580 --> 34:17.800
But the single-minded really loath some kind of selfishness that some scholars have, they just, you know, just pause me.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.840
They're not really doing this work because of anybody else.

34:20.940 --> 34:25.460
They're doing it because they want to rise in this academic priesthood.

34:26.700 --> 34:29.140
And mafe is that kind of man.

34:30.760 --> 34:37.480
He is both the best and the worst of academia put together in the same name.

34:38.500 --> 34:54.340
He's gutsy, he's extremely intelligent, he's active, but he's also outrageously selfish and he will sacrifice anybody to any degree for his own private favoring of himself.

34:56.180 --> 35:01.100
What about Laura? Is there particular powers? I'm not sure what you'd want to call them, telepathy or empathy or whatever.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.120
Is that something you might believe in or is that just a wild idea?

35:06.500 --> 35:14.280
Well, I think that there is some hope of that sort of thing being legal.

35:14.280 --> 35:23.580
But I'm not a believer, capital D believer, but I don't disbelieve either.

35:23.780 --> 35:26.120
I think that that sort of thing might very well be possible.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.360
Okay, let me move on here so I'm sure we'll have time to cover this.

35:32.740 --> 35:34.520
To move on to your novel, Soft Targets.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.400
Would you call that science fiction?

35:40.820 --> 35:42.300
What I call it with science fiction?

35:42.300 --> 35:43.300
Soft Targets.

35:43.960 --> 35:48.240
Yes, I do because it's sociological science fiction.

35:48.940 --> 35:55.540
There's engineering science, like hard sciences with hardware.

35:56.520 --> 36:05.220
And there are the, let's say, quasi-sciences, like psychology, sociology and so on.

36:06.520 --> 36:12.800
Just as sure as 1984 was science fiction, so was Soft Targets.

36:13.760 --> 36:20.300
It involves some scientific hypotheses about media theory.

36:22.880 --> 36:27.720
That was truly the initial impetus for the story.

36:27.720 --> 36:33.800
Soft Targets was this theme of what we could do about this uningene marriage between terrorism and television.

36:34.920 --> 36:40.280
That was a problem I saw in 1971, and I saw no solutions for it.

36:40.320 --> 36:45.560
It didn't work in a tree society until about 1976 I guess.

36:46.680 --> 36:53.840
In 75 or 76, I still hauling the idea over, mulling over the problem.

36:53.840 --> 37:06.260
I came across these little set of hypotheses about how you could use the model of the warfare, the media going to war against the terrorists.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.540
And see what media do when they go to war.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.740
What have they done in the past?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.040
How easy would it be to do it again?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.080
Would it be effective?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.460
And my conclusions were yes, it would be.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.580
So then I wrote the novel.

37:20.580 --> 37:25.520
I didn't want to write the novel until I had a possible solution.

37:26.500 --> 37:32.120
I didn't want to help terrorists do their thing, but for the time I wrote it, terrorists were already started to do their thing.

37:34.780 --> 37:39.620
Yeah, I guess the reason I asked, if that was science fiction, it seems to me that you say it's theory.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.180
Media theory and so forth, I would have thought that by now that's probably pretty accepted.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.480
Isn't that about your ideas about the media and terrorism?

37:47.460 --> 37:49.560
Not by the media people, it's not.

37:50.340 --> 37:56.920
They have the most selfish reason not to ask that to be considered true.

37:58.600 --> 38:07.300
And of course if they can deny it, then they can continue being irresponsible, which is of course what they want to do all along.

38:09.380 --> 38:24.020
A number of people in the top of our network media, I know that they have come across soft targets and they are none too pleased with it.

38:24.040 --> 38:31.800
It suggests a level of taking responsibility for one's importance.

38:31.800 --> 38:42.420
You know, if the media is all that important, then isn't it time they took a, they recognized their responsibilities to the public in more profound ways?

38:43.020 --> 38:48.400
Well, I say that it is time. They say that it's not. They're intended to make money.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.160
How does that look selling, you know?

38:52.860 --> 38:53.720
Say, how is it selling?

38:54.100 --> 38:54.380
Yeah.

38:55.280 --> 39:06.400
It sold pretty well. It didn't go hog wild. It sold, I would say, it sold well for the first novel.

39:07.220 --> 39:12.920
There were two editions and I believe Ace Books is going to be bringing out a third edition sometime next year.

39:14.780 --> 39:21.440
Yeah, it seemed to me that that was such a book on such a vital contemporary issue. I thought it might, have you got any movie rights?

39:21.500 --> 39:21.840
Are you interested?

39:21.840 --> 39:33.640
As it happened, my 27 year old daughter who works with Warners down south and is an actress, she does have a treatment of it.

39:33.640 --> 39:47.260
I read a couple of copies of the book and an actor named Joel Hughes is also very high on the idea.

39:48.220 --> 39:58.780
They're trying to offer that treatment and book to anyone who would pay attention to it.

39:59.360 --> 40:04.280
I think personally, the chances of it being made into a movie are perhaps one in a hundred.

40:05.400 --> 40:13.540
The one thing is, it really lays too much blame. It's very trinket.

40:14.580 --> 40:19.480
I say too much. I mean, for people in the media to be comfortable about it.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.080
It raises hell with the media leaders.

40:26.760 --> 40:37.780
But one thing, it's not liable to be the kind of movie that would ever be shown on late night television because it takes television so much to task.

40:39.320 --> 40:49.860
Why would the TV people want to beat themselves about the head and shoulders by showing a movie that snarls about their irresponsibility?

40:50.860 --> 40:52.100
Chances are they wouldn't.

40:53.060 --> 41:00.740
And when people make movies these days, they are very clearly thinking about the TV rights later on.

41:02.840 --> 41:10.480
That book reminded me of another one. It's a very different kind of book, but the idea, the power of the media is as a spin-rad bug-jack baron.

41:10.880 --> 41:15.300
Bug-jack baron, yes. That was an interesting one.

41:17.980 --> 41:22.680
Okay, let me go on for just a few minutes or just a stomach shock. Was that book hard to write?

41:23.760 --> 41:32.260
Oh, Lord. You've asked a lot of questions that I have to answer yet too, so you must have redone your homework.

41:32.260 --> 41:42.020
Yeah, it took me years to get all the background to this, especially with Asian and the Indian subcontinues on Asia.

41:42.660 --> 41:52.840
All of the variables, the socio-political variables of that book were enough to drive me crazy.

41:53.980 --> 42:04.740
I talk with historians, and in the case of India, more than any other case, I think, whatever I suggested as a scenario for the future,

42:05.680 --> 42:14.020
every historian that I would talk to would say, oh no, ever socialize. No, this can't happen because x, y, or z.

42:14.020 --> 42:26.500
Well, if that's not the case, that won't happen, then how about this? No, no, that can't happen. In short, none of them would ever be willing to speculate on what's going to happen to India.

42:29.140 --> 42:42.500
And I pretty much had to work that out of whole cloth. So I had four drawer file cabinets and, oh, perhaps, 500 textbooks at the time I was done putting it all together.

42:44.480 --> 42:53.360
Yeah, the work you put into that to me was obvious. I take it then that your scenario, your extrapolation, is pretty seriously done and in terms of what you think could happen.

42:54.080 --> 43:04.780
Well, yes, so seriously enough that some of my friends are friends of mine because, as political scientists or physicists or whatever,

43:05.680 --> 43:22.940
they read the book and said, oof, a lot of scholarly research has gone into this one again, and we would meet somewhere and get to be good friends.

43:24.660 --> 43:35.480
That doesn't say much about the popularity of the book, although systemic shock has been a bestseller in science fiction terms anyway.

43:36.380 --> 43:47.640
But it does say a lot about whether or not the work I did is appreciated by experts, and it does seem to be appreciated by experts.

43:47.640 --> 44:04.760
That's the thing that gets to them the most is that the existing problems of Islam, of India, of Japan and China are going to work out.

44:05.340 --> 44:10.560
The problems the United States will have, the problems that the Soviets will have 20 years from now, et cetera,

44:10.560 --> 44:17.280
that it simply drifts all those bulls by the horns and wrestles them all at the same time.

44:18.180 --> 44:20.660
How likely all this stuff is, who knows.

44:23.020 --> 44:29.880
But at least I did wrestle with all those problems and find a kind of jigsaw puzzle that they would fit into.

44:31.500 --> 44:37.220
Yeah, you did it. What was a jigsaw puzzle? You aren't by any chance a military strategist or a boss in that area, are you?

44:39.060 --> 44:41.520
Well, in a small way, yes.

44:41.880 --> 44:57.420
And Reginald Breitner, who is one of the better known science fiction writers and writers about science fiction, as well as writers off science fiction.

44:57.420 --> 45:05.560
And Reg has done a book on military strategy, but aren't just a whole lot of military strategists around.

45:06.260 --> 45:20.580
He's not writing books. Reg is one of them. I listen to him a lot, and of course I follow stuff in his libraries from time to time.

45:21.140 --> 45:23.240
So, yeah, strategy is something interesting.

45:25.360 --> 45:30.560
Okay, listen, Daphren, we have to switch the tape here. Can you give me about 10 or 15 minutes more after we switch it?

45:31.000 --> 45:31.540
You have to, like?

45:31.800 --> 45:34.320
Yeah. We just got to change the tape. We finished it.
