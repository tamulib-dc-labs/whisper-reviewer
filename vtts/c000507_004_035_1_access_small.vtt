WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:02.320
Now it's rolling.

00:03.100 --> 00:05.180
So let us commence without further ado.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.280
Would you please give us a little bit of your background, how you grew up, how you got interested

00:11.280 --> 00:14.880
in science fiction, and why you write science fiction now?

00:15.840 --> 00:21.700
Well, actually, I started reading science fiction kind of late compared to a lot of people

00:21.700 --> 00:27.740
because when I was growing up, well, I didn't know very much about science fiction.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.940
I'd never read any of it to speak of.

00:30.200 --> 00:38.780
And about the first science fiction I ever read in depth was H.G. Wells, which I was reading

00:38.780 --> 00:43.900
because I was interested in him, and I was also interested in writing a paper on him

00:44.780 --> 00:47.420
for a class I was taking in high school.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.440
So that was what got me started, and it wasn't until I was in college that I really started

00:54.440 --> 00:56.000
reading a lot of science fiction.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.540
I really found out how many writers there were.

00:58.720 --> 01:04.020
I thought that basically that was, you know, Alice Huxley or H.G. Wells, you know, and

01:04.020 --> 01:08.720
a few writers who would sort of do a science fictional or utopian or satirical kind of

01:08.720 --> 01:11.660
book, and I didn't really know about any of the other stuff until a lot later.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.820
So I don't know if that answers your question.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.840
Yeah, yeah, that answers it fine.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.260
What is your definition of science fiction?

01:24.340 --> 01:26.360
I don't really have one.

01:26.860 --> 01:31.460
I mean, I think it's pretty obvious what it is when you look at it, that it deals with

01:31.460 --> 01:37.180
times other than the here and now, usually things in the future or in an alternate world

01:37.180 --> 01:45.100
or whatever, but I get very annoyed and very impatient with definitions anyway.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.480
Unfortunately, I think a lot of what defines science fiction is that it's a publisher's

01:50.480 --> 01:50.980
category.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.180
Basically, the publisher's to say, well, this is science fiction, we'll publish it as science

01:55.180 --> 01:55.560
fiction.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.800
It's a publisher's category, and I don't think writers really think of it quite as much

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
as the publishers do.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.540
I think most writers would probably rather that the books were just thought of as novels

02:06.100 --> 02:13.560
that just happen to be a little more distant from present day life than other kinds of

02:13.560 --> 02:13.780
books.

02:14.740 --> 02:15.020
What?

02:16.500 --> 02:18.360
Your background is in philosophy.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.340
Was that a good discipline from which to write science fiction?

02:23.340 --> 02:23.780
Probably.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.660
But I think that almost anything would be a good discipline from which to write science

02:28.660 --> 02:30.280
fiction or anything else probably.

02:30.520 --> 02:39.000
I think what's useful about philosophy is that it's, I think, oh, jeez, I'm stuttering.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.940
Maybe I'd better start this over again.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.600
Yeah, go right ahead.

02:44.120 --> 02:44.660
Okay.

02:46.980 --> 02:52.400
I think the best thing about philosophy as a training is that it teaches you to sort

02:52.400 --> 02:58.680
out reasonable sorts of ideas or consistent sorts of ideas from things that are just completely

02:58.680 --> 02:59.840
bizarre or ridiculous.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.280
That's probably one of the best things about it.

03:03.900 --> 03:08.380
And it's also the kind of thing that I don't think you can study for very long unless you

03:08.380 --> 03:10.060
become interested in other things.

03:10.060 --> 03:14.120
Now, I know a lot of people nowadays would probably disagree with that because the trend

03:14.120 --> 03:20.760
in philosophy has been towards the analytic school and the sort of thing that has almost

03:20.760 --> 03:25.340
no relation to anything, symbolic logic and that sort of thing, where it becomes very,

03:25.360 --> 03:26.000
very abstract.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.120
That's been the trend.

03:27.340 --> 03:32.300
I was always sort of at odds with that because my interest was more in the history of philosophy

03:33.180 --> 03:35.720
and in particular in ancient philosophy.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.160
I was taking Greek so that I could read the stuff properly.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.080
And I was a lot more interested in that kind of thing.

03:42.140 --> 03:46.800
That's not the general trend of modern day philosophy at all, but that was my interest.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.720
And that particular kind of thing I think is probably useful.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.360
At least I learned how to do a lot of research because the kind of thing I was doing, I had

03:55.360 --> 03:58.720
to, and it's always useful to know how to do research for writing science fiction.

04:00.820 --> 04:06.880
A number of your works have biological themes as well as the anthologies you've edited.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.960
Do you have a latent interest in biology?

04:10.220 --> 04:12.100
Well, I probably do.

04:12.380 --> 04:19.000
I took a special course in it when I was a kid and well, you know, with a lot of other

04:19.000 --> 04:21.320
students who were ticked to take a certain course.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.540
And I did pretty well in that.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.660
It was one of the few sciences I did do well and I took a little bit of it in college,

04:29.660 --> 04:30.920
although not very much.

04:32.840 --> 04:38.140
And I suppose if I had gone into a science that would have been the one I would have gone into.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.600
So that's probably affected my topics for us.

04:46.860 --> 04:50.400
Were you ever tempted to stay in academia and teach philosophy?

04:51.180 --> 04:54.380
Well, I was thinking of doing that.

04:54.480 --> 05:00.980
That was why I was in grad school, but it became pretty obvious after a while that there weren't going to be any jobs in the field.

05:01.720 --> 05:10.320
And that it would have been years spent working towards the doctorate and then trying to find a job and probably not being able to find one.

05:10.440 --> 05:16.520
I have serious doubts as to whether I could have found any kind of permanent job or any kind of reasonable job.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.980
I probably would have been one of those part-time migrating academics.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.800
And that didn't exactly appeal to me.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.020
I have to admit.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.300
But I have thought of going into it.

05:28.500 --> 05:34.240
There seems to be even less government support for the social sciences now than there ever was.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.480
And of course, when you were in school, it wasn't all that good anyway.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.080
I would tend to think that's kind of an alarming trend.

05:41.020 --> 05:41.920
Yes, it is.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.180
I mean, now in my case, I don't really feel that bad about it.

05:45.240 --> 05:50.440
Looking back at it, I don't suppose I ever would have been a terrific philosopher to begin with.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.040
I probably would have been second rate.

05:52.620 --> 05:59.460
But as far as the people who are really gifted in this kind of thing, I think it's probably a tragedy.

05:59.620 --> 06:06.320
And it may take 10 or 20 years before people see it and suddenly realize that there's no one around to teach certain things,

06:07.060 --> 06:12.400
that there's no one around to convey certain kinds of knowledge and that something has been lost.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.020
So that worries me.

06:17.200 --> 06:17.760
Yeah.

06:18.780 --> 06:22.460
Okay, let's start talking about some specific works then.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.380
You started out in print with short stories, which were later collected in Star Shadows.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.200
Should beginning writers try to establish themselves by writing short stories before they move on to something else?

06:34.300 --> 06:41.220
Well, that depends because one of the advantages of a short story, obviously, for a beginning writer,

06:41.640 --> 06:45.380
is that you can start it and finish it and have some immediate reinforcement.

06:45.660 --> 06:52.200
You're more likely to be able to sit and sustain the effort to finish a short story, which is hard enough to begin with.

06:52.240 --> 06:59.080
It's hard enough just to sit down and finish a story, let alone sit and write a novel and not know what's going to happen,

06:59.080 --> 07:02.220
and then not know what to do with the thing after you've finished it,

07:02.300 --> 07:05.840
wondering if anyone's even going to look at it, let alone buy it.

07:08.440 --> 07:12.860
And so in a practical sense, it probably makes sense to start out with short stories.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.480
The trouble is, not everybody is a short story writer.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.800
Some writers are basically novelists.

07:18.420 --> 07:24.960
If they try to start out by writing short stories, they may find that somehow the thing feels unfinished,

07:24.960 --> 07:30.540
or that it's really not complete, or that it's not really what the particular writer wants to do.

07:30.700 --> 07:37.900
And in that case, I think it might be better off to try writing a novel, even if it is harder,

07:37.900 --> 07:41.200
just to know that you can sit there and finish it.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.380
Once you've finished the first one, it doesn't guarantee you'll ever write another one,

07:46.480 --> 07:51.540
but it's a big step forward, just to finish it, even if no one buys it.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.800
So I don't know, I think it depends on the particular writer.

07:55.040 --> 08:00.540
I think if you have a particular short story gift, obviously it would help to start out writing short stories.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.360
It means if you present a book to an editor, you're not going to be a complete unknown.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.900
They will have known that the writer has published something, but not everybody can do it.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And there are some writers who have just simply gone right into novel writing to begin with,

08:15.680 --> 08:20.200
and have gone all right at that, and never wrote short stories at all,

08:20.320 --> 08:22.820
or maybe wrote a couple after they had published novels.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.580
In your short story collection, Star Shadows, there were ten stories,

08:31.740 --> 08:34.580
and by my reckoning, which is not guaranteed to be correct,

08:34.960 --> 08:39.140
seven of the ten of them involved relationships between couples,

08:39.140 --> 08:45.200
and the relationships ranged from pretty abysmal ones to a pretty good one,

08:46.040 --> 08:47.820
like in, If Ever I Should Leave You.

08:48.440 --> 08:52.360
This isn't a theme that's usually presented in science fiction stories.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.280
Did you consciously put that in there?

08:55.380 --> 09:00.380
Is that your reason for writing the short stories, to show such relationships?

09:01.080 --> 09:03.560
No, it really wasn't. It just turned out that way.

09:03.560 --> 09:08.260
It's probably just because when I begin to write a story or anything,

09:08.500 --> 09:11.560
I like to have an idea of a particular character,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.860
and usually the character begins...

09:16.860 --> 09:22.360
It sounds strange to put it this way, but usually what happens is the character will begin to speak to me in some way.

09:22.820 --> 09:25.340
I'll begin to get a sense of who this person is.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.540
As I find out more about the character, it's just the character is telling me about her life,

09:31.540 --> 09:39.000
or his life, what's going on in it, what kind of experiences they've had in their childhood, and so forth.

09:39.380 --> 09:46.420
And so if a relationship is in there, it's partly because it may have something to do with the theme of the story,

09:46.560 --> 09:49.500
also, it may reflect the theme of the story in some cases.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.940
But it's also simply because as I write about a character,

09:53.220 --> 09:58.820
it's obvious that I'm going to be filling in certain things about the character's life as I go along.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.880
I didn't consciously set out to say,

10:01.960 --> 10:08.660
well, I am going to write about relationships, and the relationships will reflect the theme of the story, or mirror it, or whatever.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.560
I'm afraid I'm not that conscious of writer, so it just turned out that way.

10:15.280 --> 10:20.260
If I write about couples, or relationships between couples, which I probably have a tendency to do,

10:20.640 --> 10:23.900
it's because that's more familiar to me than a lot of other things.

10:24.580 --> 10:31.080
Obviously, if I weren't part of a couple, then I probably would be writing more about single people,

10:31.560 --> 10:37.740
or about someone else, so that's probably it.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.320
The other emotional theme that I saw in a lot of those stories was empathy,

10:43.600 --> 10:47.040
which is harder to define and harder to write about, I would think.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.500
I assume it came up for the same reason.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.340
Yeah, I think it did.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.060
One of the stories that really interested me in that collection was Gather Blue Roses,

11:00.640 --> 11:04.520
which, again, if I'm right, it inspired at least two paperback covers.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.880
I saw some blue roses on Star Shadows, and then the one on Wondering Stars.

11:10.100 --> 11:16.700
You've made some comments and forwards and things that you have trouble with titles, so I'll ask you about that title.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.480
Where did Gather Blue Roses come from?

11:19.420 --> 11:23.540
Well, that is a good question. I don't really know.

11:24.840 --> 11:32.160
I do know that it has something to do with a particular symbol of trying to forget and trying to forget things.

11:32.260 --> 11:38.860
Obviously, the color blue has quite a lot to do with sadness and with tragedy, which is what that story was about.

11:39.520 --> 11:44.800
I'm sure it has a strange title for the story, probably, but that's it.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.980
I got the title from someone else. I showed him the story and said,

11:49.360 --> 11:54.160
I don't have any kind of title for this. I had a title for it when I started out, which was abysmal,

11:54.220 --> 11:57.180
but I had to put something at the top of the page when I was writing it.

11:58.720 --> 12:06.260
I put a god-awful title on the page and showed it to another writer, and he was the one that gave me the title.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.600
I'll have to assign the credit elsewhere.

12:10.140 --> 12:15.700
Is it true that it is difficult to think of the good catchy titles that editors like and that readers want to read?

12:15.820 --> 12:23.740
It probably isn't for some people, but it is for me. I sometimes wish that there were a title writing workshop that I could go to

12:23.740 --> 12:27.880
so that I could come up with titles. It is a real agony for me.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.740
That is the worst thing about a story for me sometimes, is just coming up with a title.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.620
I've been lucky with a few. I've written a few things for the title, naturally, grew out of the story.

12:37.620 --> 12:47.520
But very often I don't have a title when I start. I know that's strange because I've heard people say that they always have to have a title before they start,

12:47.900 --> 12:51.280
or they can't proceed. I almost never have a title when I start.

12:52.480 --> 12:57.560
But occasionally I'm lucky and a few things have titles that are pretty obvious.

13:00.980 --> 13:05.720
Okay, I now have a trivia question. Three stories that appeared in a row,

13:06.160 --> 13:14.500
Gather Blue Roses, Oasis, and Julio 204, all written in 1971, had a character named Simon in them. Was this just coincidental?

13:15.340 --> 13:19.120
It probably was. It probably was coincidental.

13:19.880 --> 13:25.520
I noticed it at the time myself, and about the only thing I can say about that is that

13:27.060 --> 13:34.240
I don't think I was particularly fixated on the name, but it just seemed that that was the name of that particular character.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.400
And the fact that it occurred three times really is not important as far as I know.

13:39.620 --> 13:44.620
Maybe somebody will do an analysis of it and find out that it is, but as far as I know it has no meaning.

13:47.540 --> 13:55.500
The novel Cloned Lies is an expansion or a fusion of at least three short stories that I could count.

13:56.060 --> 14:01.580
When you started writing the short stories, did you have the idea in the back of your head to go ahead and do a novel eventually?

14:03.100 --> 14:10.040
Not really. Not really. The stories, when I wrote the first story, maybe I should start at the beginning.

14:10.040 --> 14:16.660
When I wrote the first story, I was writing for a particular anthology.

14:16.880 --> 14:23.200
Well, I wasn't really writing for this anthology, but as I was writing the story, an editor told me he might be interested in this particular story.

14:24.120 --> 14:30.700
I wrote that. It occurred to me a few months later that I might want to use the same characters in another story,

14:31.060 --> 14:34.780
since I had become interested in them when I wrote the first one. So I did that.

14:35.500 --> 14:43.240
And the whole thing grew from there. I didn't intend for it to be a novel, which may be a flaw in the book for all I know.

14:44.220 --> 14:49.920
I originally thought of just writing a couple of stories about these characters, and I got more interested in them.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.260
Then I thought maybe of writing a series of stories about them.

14:54.160 --> 15:00.380
And then the novel sort of grew from that. I had to search for a structure for the novel,

15:00.380 --> 15:07.860
which was a little difficult to do, since I had been writing it in pieces, starting in the middle, going to the beginning, moving towards the end.

15:08.640 --> 15:17.340
And to extract a structure from that was a little difficult, but I wouldn't recommend it as a way to write a novel.

15:17.540 --> 15:22.160
It may be a good way to write a first novel, because at least I finished the damn thing.

15:22.620 --> 15:28.340
If I had started out saying I was going to write the book, I might never have gotten to the end.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.760
I might have been too intimidated by the length.

15:34.240 --> 15:40.600
As in many of your short stories, your depiction of the future and Cloned Lies is pretty grim.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.620
Does this reflect your own personal feelings about what we're doing now?

15:45.340 --> 15:52.620
Oh, I'm sure it does. I'm sure it does. I'm somewhat of a pessimist.

15:56.640 --> 16:05.000
When the Clones were born, I was surprised that they were spanked. I would have thought that they would have been born by Le Boyer method or something like that.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.720
You know, now that I think of it, that probably would have been a better method for them.

16:10.240 --> 16:19.400
I mean, given the fact that they were coming out of artificial lungs in the first place, which was probably traumatic enough, for all I know, that probably would have been a gentler method.

16:19.400 --> 16:30.440
Now that I think of it, that's probably something if I were writing it now, I might have done differently.

16:32.200 --> 16:38.040
When I read it, I was particularly tuned into Le Boyer, so that's kind of picky, I got to admit.

16:38.420 --> 16:48.740
No, no, it really isn't picky. I don't suppose I really thought very much about that, and about that particular method.

16:48.740 --> 17:00.860
Although it seems to me it might actually have been difficult, because given the fact that they were being born in a lab, given the fact that they were being born in a way that human beings haven't been born,

17:02.600 --> 17:08.120
I'm not sure how you would apply Le Boyer to them. There's no mother for them to rest against to speak of.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.320
However, I suppose that maybe the people in the lab could have been a little gentler with them.

17:16.980 --> 17:24.120
Okay, your knowledge of children and the dynamics of sibling interaction came through pretty strongly in this book.

17:24.540 --> 17:28.240
Did you go up with brothers and sisters or have a lot of children around when you were growing up?

17:28.240 --> 17:36.900
Oh yes, oh yes, I did go up with brothers and sisters, and my little brother and sister, I often looked after my little brother and sister as a matter of fact.

17:37.860 --> 17:52.900
And I often babysat. And I suppose that some of the ways in which the people in Cron's lives interact with each other are partly some of the ways in which my family interacted.

17:52.900 --> 18:05.220
I mean, one of the things I noticed when, not when I was growing up but sometime later, was that in a large family I think everyone tends to stake out his or her territory,

18:05.980 --> 18:14.080
and each child sort of becomes an expert or takes over a certain thing that's theirs, and that's not the other kids.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.020
You know, to sort of distinguish yourself from one another.

18:18.200 --> 18:26.060
And when I was writing about the Flintstones in Cron's lives, it didn't surprise me that they would try to do the same thing.

18:26.260 --> 18:32.500
And as a matter of fact, I'd also had experience with twins because I have cousins who are twins and there are twins in my family.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.620
So it's a natural thing, I think.

18:36.620 --> 18:49.040
Well, more so now than it used to be, especially for identical twins, to try to distinguish themselves from each other, to try to do things a little differently so that each one sort of has his or her own identity.

18:51.140 --> 18:54.400
So there is probably some of that experience in the book.

18:56.080 --> 19:00.240
I thought the most ambitious part of the book was the multiple points of view that you took.

19:00.240 --> 19:08.020
Each of the clones had a different characterization, and they were unique, and I would think that would be pretty hard to pull off.

19:08.360 --> 19:18.420
Well, what's funny about that is, I suppose it probably seems as though it would be hard, but consider this, I was a beginning novelist then, hadn't written a book before.

19:19.480 --> 19:30.640
I knew that writing from different points of view was certainly not something that a beginning writer should probably tackle, but at the same time, I was writing about clones.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.560
So I was reasoning this way.

19:33.100 --> 19:44.320
I thought, well, if the points of view seem similar, I can't get called on that or criticized for that because after all, the characters are clones of one another.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.860
So obviously there would be some similarity.

19:47.620 --> 19:57.180
So I didn't have to worry quite as much as I might have if I were writing from completely, from the points of view of completely different people who were unrelated.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.480
I think that's a much more difficult sort of thing.

20:00.220 --> 20:03.360
The fact that they were clones, I think, gave me a little more leeway there.

20:06.740 --> 20:10.620
Again, I harp on this, and I will continue harping on this.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.320
This was a people novel.

20:12.980 --> 20:19.160
You dealt primarily with the feelings of the clones, the isolation, how they felt different, that sort of thing.

20:19.560 --> 20:26.240
And that is different from most science fiction that we read because it's generally the hardware that's concentrated on by the authors now.

20:27.060 --> 20:34.360
Well, I think that's true of a certain kind of science fiction, but I think there's always been science fiction that's concentrated in the other things.

20:34.360 --> 20:46.400
Now, maybe my experience was a little different too because the fact that I didn't start reading science fiction and collater meant that the sorts of things I did read tended to concentrate on people more.

20:46.860 --> 20:55.400
And it was actually a surprise to me when I found out that there were books that concentrated more on technology or engineering sorts of things,

20:55.600 --> 21:00.600
and that just came as a surprise to me when I found out about it, and I found out about it rather late.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.520
So it never occurred to me that novels wouldn't be about people.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.080
I just had no experience with that.

21:07.320 --> 21:13.880
So when I started writing, I think it was a natural thing for me to start writing with that kind of attitude.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.320
I'd always assumed that novels were essentially about people.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.240
Let's think about real life now.

21:24.100 --> 21:28.040
If it were possible to clone people, should there be a moratorium?

21:28.300 --> 21:29.040
Should that be studied?

21:29.620 --> 21:32.800
Are there going to be some dire consequences if we go ahead and do it?

21:33.480 --> 21:39.760
Well, I think when I was writing Clone Rise, I might have been a little more pessimistic than I would be now.

21:40.160 --> 21:50.260
I mean, we've already seen Test Two Babies, and so the world has not exactly gone rushing to the barricades or demanding that this be stopped or anything.

21:50.260 --> 21:53.100
I think most people don't really seem to think that much about it.

21:53.140 --> 22:02.660
It seems reasonable to them that if someone can't have a child in the normal way, that this kind of thing is really perfectly acceptable.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.680
Now, of course, there's a big difference between that kind of thing and cloning.

22:06.220 --> 22:11.860
I think cloning presents a great many more problems that this kind of thing doesn't present.

22:12.140 --> 22:18.620
We haven't even gotten to the point of talking about artificial wounds or any of this sort of stuff.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.880
And I think there are going to be a lot of important issues to resolve.

22:24.040 --> 22:30.000
At the same time, I'm no longer quite so sure that people are going to become completely hysterical about it,

22:30.180 --> 22:36.080
or that it's necessarily going to be bad, or that it's necessarily going to damage us in some way.

22:36.560 --> 22:45.640
Although I do think that as far as cloning in particular is concerned, I'm not sure there's really any constructive reason for bothering with it.

22:46.260 --> 22:49.480
I can't think of too many reasons to clone anyone.

22:50.120 --> 23:00.800
And one of the things that I tried to show in cloned lives at least a little bit is that the notion of cloning people thinking that they are going to be like the person they are cloned from

23:00.800 --> 23:04.060
is really an illusion. They're going to be themselves.

23:05.200 --> 23:10.660
They won't have the same experience. They won't grow up the same way. They won't have the same environment.

23:10.660 --> 23:14.680
And that will create a certain kind of divergence.

23:17.880 --> 23:24.580
I'll make a prediction. The only people that will be interested in cloning are going to be the professional sports teams.

23:25.580 --> 23:29.780
Possibly. Although even there, you can't be sure. You might clone someone.

23:30.280 --> 23:37.080
I mean, there are people who have gone in for athletics very heavily and were very gifted at it,

23:37.080 --> 23:43.040
who, given other circumstances, might have done something else, but just didn't have those circumstances.

23:43.340 --> 23:52.360
Maybe for them, sports was a way out of the ghetto or a way out of poverty or a way to make a living or something that they loved,

23:52.540 --> 23:55.300
something that they just had a real gift for.

23:57.060 --> 24:04.980
I'm not so sure that their children, even if they were cloned, are exactly the same, would go in for sports in the same way.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.140
I don't think that's at all obvious.

24:08.340 --> 24:12.260
Although, of course, if they were brought up with that in mind, then you have another problem.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.300
Are you really giving the person any choice?

24:15.420 --> 24:21.960
And what time he becomes later on, if you deliberately clone someone, bring him up to do a certain thing?

24:23.180 --> 24:25.620
You know, I think there are more issues there, too.

24:27.840 --> 24:35.200
Not that that would stop big-time sports people from trying to clone somebody, especially if they had enough money to throw around.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.940
Yeah, that seems to be where all the money is these days.

24:38.440 --> 24:38.740
Yep.

24:39.880 --> 24:45.880
Okay, the novel, A Sudden Star, is another expansion of a couple of short stories.

24:46.060 --> 24:50.520
Again, the same question. Did you have the novel in mind when you came up with the short stories?

24:50.820 --> 24:54.180
No, the short story was just one short story.

24:54.760 --> 25:00.480
And then, later on, I thought perhaps of writing about some of the other characters in the book.

25:01.960 --> 25:08.540
But I had only written one story when I sat down and tried to figure out what kind of novel I would do.

25:09.900 --> 25:22.180
And so that was more...in that book, which is my second novel, I came a little closer to actually planning a novel as a novel that I had in Qualum's lives.

25:23.260 --> 25:29.400
And, well, I don't really know what else to say about that.

25:30.860 --> 25:39.200
When I read Julio 204, I got the idea that Simon Negron was a pretty rough, tough, callous customer.

25:39.340 --> 25:46.400
But when I read The Sudden Star, especially towards the end of the book, he turned out to be a little bit different than I would have anticipated.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.640
Did he grow as you wrote the novel?

25:50.640 --> 25:54.440
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I definitely think so. I definitely think so.

25:55.280 --> 26:00.620
And also, well, of course, one of the other things with that character is like a lot of characters that I write about.

26:01.380 --> 26:06.040
I sometimes use it as a starting point. People I know. Very often that's how I'll start.

26:06.240 --> 26:14.880
Although then the characters change. And they are never exact duplicates of anyone I know by the time I finish a book,

26:14.920 --> 26:19.660
because obviously they're going to be changed. The action of the book is going to change and so forth.

26:20.420 --> 26:26.540
But I did start out with a particular person in my home I knew when I wrote about Simon Negron.

26:26.720 --> 26:33.920
And I suppose as I came to know more about him, that was probably reflected in how he was portrayed in the book also.

26:38.800 --> 26:44.500
The principal scenes in that book took place in upstate New York, in New York City, in Miami.

26:45.480 --> 26:50.980
Are you very familiar with the geography of all these places because there was quite a realistic feeling?

26:51.520 --> 26:56.900
Well, I went to every place in the book. Every place that's in the book I went to.

26:57.200 --> 27:02.640
Because I don't like to write about places I haven't been or things I haven't seen.

27:02.720 --> 27:09.320
Now, sometimes it's unavoidable with science fiction, obviously, if you're going to write about the moon or if you're going to write about another planet.

27:09.320 --> 27:15.240
But at least with the solar system there, there's more and more research being done that you can read about.

27:15.380 --> 27:21.780
But as far as Earth goes, I like to visit places that I'm going to write about. I feel much more comfortable doing that.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.680
All of those places are places I've seen.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.000
Subway, unfortunately.

27:31.180 --> 27:37.420
Subway seemed to be breaking down in New York a lot more quickly than I anticipated when I wrote The Sudden Snow.

27:38.320 --> 27:38.840
Okay.

27:43.020 --> 27:48.980
Do you have a location in mind where the farm was, that area, which part of upstate New York that's around?

27:49.520 --> 27:54.680
I thought of Pennsylvania more than upstate New York. I think the farm was probably in Pennsylvania.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.020
I'm right near the Pennsylvania border anyway.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.220
Okay.

28:01.180 --> 28:09.620
At what point in your writing did the mirror star, that idea of that symbolism come into existence?

28:11.320 --> 28:15.340
Well, I thought of that at the beginning.

28:15.700 --> 28:22.740
And originally, I had thought of an actual cosmic disaster which had affected the Earth.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.880
And then I began to think that that really wasn't what I was driving at in the book.

28:27.960 --> 28:32.460
I didn't want to talk about something that's completely outside that destroys things.

28:32.700 --> 28:38.240
Because what has destroyed the Earth in that book is not anything outside of it or anything in the cosmos.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.500
It's the people on Earth that are full of destroyed it.

28:42.100 --> 28:47.320
And the star is simply their explanation because it's a way of evading the responsibility in a sense.

28:48.620 --> 28:54.960
Having seen everything for a parent, people, I assumed, would look for something to blame.

28:55.320 --> 28:59.680
And in this particular case, they blame the star, which really has nothing to do with anything.

29:00.220 --> 29:03.940
It's just what's going to get the blame for the situation.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.780
Was the... excuse me.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.120
That's okay. Go ahead.

29:09.300 --> 29:13.900
That's the hard thing about talking on a phone. You don't get any signals here.

29:14.940 --> 29:16.700
Is the Seton Star your title?

29:17.740 --> 29:24.860
Yes, it is. Although in England, the publisher asked if they could change the title to the White Death

29:25.300 --> 29:28.420
because they didn't want it to sound like a science fiction book.

29:28.780 --> 29:32.900
So they thought the White Death, I guess, sounded more like a non-science fiction book.

29:33.220 --> 29:36.180
I didn't think that was worth arguing about, so I said that's fine.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.480
And I suppose I could have called it the White Death, too, but I didn't.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.380
I think the Seton Star is much more appropriate.

29:44.580 --> 29:48.060
I think it probably is, too. I think it probably is, too.

29:48.340 --> 29:56.020
Although what's interesting about the British publisher picking that particular title is that one of the periods I had done some research on

29:57.100 --> 30:02.500
before doing the Seton Star was the 13th century, and I wanted, in the 14th century,

30:02.500 --> 30:09.260
I wanted to read about a period where everything was breaking down, where society was beginning to collapse.

30:11.740 --> 30:17.320
And particularly the effects that the Black Death had on Europe.

30:18.400 --> 30:24.380
And the reason I was doing that is because I was dealing with another society later on that was breaking down in the Seton Star,

30:24.540 --> 30:30.140
and I wanted to have some sense of what that kind of thing was like historically before I wrote about the future.

30:30.760 --> 30:36.680
And so I suppose in that sense it's appropriate that they wanted to call it the White Death as opposed to the Black Death,

30:36.840 --> 30:41.900
but I think the Seton Star is probably a more pertinent title.

30:43.940 --> 30:49.960
You had some good characters at the end of the book, Paulette and Ildico.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.900
Are you planning to do a sequel? Will we see these characters again?

30:54.560 --> 30:59.800
I'm not planning to do any sequels. If one comes up, that's another matter.

30:59.800 --> 31:06.880
I suppose that one thing about writing is that the characters have lives before you start writing the book,

31:06.960 --> 31:14.620
and then they have lives that go on after you finish the book, and I suppose it's always possible to write each book from some other character's point of view,

31:14.980 --> 31:19.460
and it's always possible to write about what happens to some of the people after you finish one book too.

31:19.800 --> 31:26.860
But if that happens, it happens. I haven't consciously thought of it. That would have to grow by itself, I think.

31:29.800 --> 31:38.980
Okay, your novel Watchstar. That seemed to be a lot different from your other books to me in that it was a much more visual book.

31:39.340 --> 31:46.720
There was a lot of, oh, the cat juggling scene, the visions of the ancient city, the bones all blowing around.

31:47.180 --> 31:48.780
Was this a new facet of your writing?

31:50.800 --> 31:59.480
Well, I'm not sure. I think what was happening there is I was dealing with a character who, well, among other things,

31:59.540 --> 32:05.900
she was different from other characters I'd written about in that she was a member of the illiterate culture.

32:06.220 --> 32:15.800
She was a member of a culture that had certain psychic powers, and I suppose that looking at things through her eyes,

32:15.800 --> 32:20.860
which I had to do as I was writing it, it was a natural thing to see things more visually.

32:26.540 --> 32:35.120
The novel Science Fiction Concept in that book was Life on the Comets, People Settling in the Comets and Living There.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.580
How did that occur to you?

32:37.580 --> 32:48.440
Well, that was an idea I got from Freeman Dyson who said and made the suggestion a few years ago that you could get a comet

32:48.440 --> 32:57.620
and you could settle it and there are enough materials on some of the large comets so that you could have life there.

32:57.740 --> 33:04.380
You could perhaps grow big giant trees and so on. He even talks about growing these big giant trees and having these very green wolves.

33:04.380 --> 33:12.520
I loved that idea for one reason because the one thing I didn't want to do is I didn't want to have my character, Gaia,

33:13.460 --> 33:23.700
make contact with this other civilization which has settled in the comet, and then go up there and wind up in one of these stainless steel futures.

33:23.980 --> 33:30.920
I've just got so sick of those, or plastic futures. They seem to be one or the other. You have the stainless steel ones that are very Art Deco,

33:30.920 --> 33:43.500
and then you have the plastic ones where everybody has tiny micromaniaturized things and weird sorts of decor that look like the inside of McDonald's or something.

33:44.720 --> 33:50.240
I didn't want to write about that kind of future society. I wanted to have something a little different.

33:50.240 --> 34:00.240
In fact, what I wound up with was having a comet society which is actually very much like living in a garden or living in a jungle

34:00.240 --> 34:06.840
or living in a natural environment in a way even though it's a very unnaturally created environment.

34:07.940 --> 34:14.660
It's just appealed to me more than writing about the other kind of future, I suppose, or the other kind of possible future world.

34:17.100 --> 34:31.000
With all the clone novels and stories that we've seen, nobody has ever expressed the fear which you did when Gaia was talking when, is it Raiho?

34:31.120 --> 34:39.080
That's how I pronounced his name. And the Té were, after he had died, and she was saying that they would implant another memory in his body.

34:39.080 --> 34:45.500
And Gaia was arguing that that wouldn't be Raiho. It has its memories, but his soul is gone. He's gone.

34:45.840 --> 34:51.820
And I'd never seen anybody write that, although that had occurred to me, that the essence or whatever the person would be gone.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.600
And I was glad to see that discussed for a change.

34:55.040 --> 35:03.860
Yes. I mean, you could, well, you can call it a soul if you want, or you could call it simply the memories and the essence, I suppose,

35:03.860 --> 35:15.140
or whatever is in the person. The fact of the matter is, if you take any body, I think, and strip it completely of its memories, its experiences, and so on,

35:15.700 --> 35:24.880
even if you plant something in there that takes place, that has all the memories, now everyone else will treat the person exactly the same way.

35:25.120 --> 35:29.820
There won't be any difference, probably, as far as they're concerned. The person will be the same to them.

35:29.820 --> 35:41.460
But it's not the same person. I think that's probably obvious. I don't know. I know that it's a lot more popular to assume that it would be the same person,

35:41.500 --> 35:45.980
but it wouldn't be the same person. I just don't think so.

35:46.840 --> 35:54.420
So Raiho really is dead, as far as I'm concerned. The characters who went through that book by that time is actually gone,

35:54.420 --> 35:59.840
even though there will be another Raiho who will go about his business, who will have all his memories, and so on.

36:00.220 --> 36:07.400
Now, some people have written about matter transmitters who've talked about this, too. If you send somebody through a matter transmitter,

36:08.320 --> 36:19.140
which is another sort of problem also, and you have somebody at the other end who's just duplicated from the pattern, is that really the person?

36:19.140 --> 36:23.060
I have a person died and another person been created to take his place.

36:26.420 --> 36:29.240
Something they never discussed on Star Trek as far as I know.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.440
Yeah, Captain Kirk was gone in the first episode, I guess.

36:36.300 --> 36:46.340
Okay, the golden space. That had shades of cloned lives in that it was about a group of, concerned a group of children that were different

36:46.340 --> 36:56.960
and perceived themselves as different. Did this kind of idea occur to you when you were doing cloned lives, or did the embryonic stages of it hit you then?

36:57.720 --> 37:07.960
No, actually, what happened with that story is it's unusual in one sense, because usually I write stories without regard to where I'm going to sell them until after I finish them.

37:07.960 --> 37:19.320
In this particular case, Jack Dam was doing an anthology. He was doing it on the theme of immortality, and he had asked several writers for stories for the book.

37:19.460 --> 37:20.620
He wanted long stories.

37:24.560 --> 37:31.020
And so I thought about the topic, and I said, well, immortality, I don't know if there's really anything to write about immortality.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.000
I really didn't think there was. It just didn't seem that interesting to me.

37:35.760 --> 37:42.560
And after I thought about it for a while, I finally decided maybe I would try writing a long story about it.

37:42.640 --> 37:50.940
I was more interested, not even in the immortality theme, but in the theme of what would you do if you were immortal, and that was already a given.

37:51.320 --> 37:58.440
And you were beginning to get tired of things, and what kind of children might you raise, and so on and so forth.

37:58.440 --> 38:10.360
I didn't really think of it as an outgrowth of qualms lies at all, although I suppose some of the same concerns must have been there, and I must have been sort of chewing them over in my mind without really realizing it.

38:11.340 --> 38:22.240
And so I wrote the first part of the Golden Space, the renewal, as a short novel for the anthology, sort of stimulated me to think about the subject a little bit.

38:23.080 --> 38:29.300
And I figured that would be the end of that, too. I guess it was another situation like qualms lies. I thought, well, that's that.

38:29.420 --> 38:37.220
I've written that short novel, and I probably won't have anything more to say about this, but later on I found other things I wanted to write.

38:37.820 --> 38:44.080
The Summer's Dust section I originally didn't write as a part of that book at all, either. That's another thing, even though it became part of the book.

38:44.080 --> 38:53.560
I wrote that as a separate story, and I knew it was dealing with the same world, but I just thought it was going to be a separate story and not part of the novel.

38:54.260 --> 38:59.780
But later on I decided to incorporate it, since I wanted to use one of the characters later on.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.220
Okay, you just answered my next question.

39:07.140 --> 39:16.380
Okay, the heart of the novel is immortality, and then with aging and growing old, that sort of thing thrown in.

39:16.640 --> 39:26.860
I would think that this is where your philosophical background would have really been helpful, as opposed to those that don't have that kind of background, and just to think about these sorts of things.

39:28.100 --> 39:41.820
Well, I don't know. Well, in the case of immortality, I'm not so sure, because that has been such a popular thing for people to think about since probably forever.

39:42.520 --> 39:49.060
I mean, people have always been thinking about that. There have always been stories about people who were immortal or thought for immortality or whatever.

39:50.580 --> 39:58.740
The thing is, what to do when you actually have that is another problem. Maybe there has something to do with it.

40:02.840 --> 40:13.980
In the latter stages of the book, the character Domingo is explaining to the people that he's captured or is treating to his hospitality.

40:13.980 --> 40:21.780
He's talking about his village, and he's talking about the people in his village, that they have divided minds, and that their minds talk and voice each other.

40:21.920 --> 40:27.960
So immediately, to my mind, came this book by Julian James called The Origin of Conscious and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.

40:28.400 --> 40:40.580
Oh, yes. I definitely incorporated that book. I had read that book a couple of years earlier, and I drew on it for some of the inspiration.

40:40.580 --> 40:51.720
Although I'm a little dubious about some things in that book, although it can still be useful for a novel, even though I'm somewhat dubious about not necessarily about the theory itself,

40:52.780 --> 41:02.200
but about his notion that people as recently as 3,000 years ago might have been in that state.

41:02.200 --> 41:14.980
That I consider more dubious, and I found his analysis of the Iliad somewhat unconvincing. I don't even know if he knows Greek. I found it a very, very strange thing.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.880
And I don't know any classicists who would buy that part of the argument at all.

41:22.640 --> 41:29.900
But as an idea, it's very intriguing. It does have the virtue of explaining a lot of things that would otherwise be unexplainable.

41:30.600 --> 41:37.740
And for the purpose of this book, I thought maybe I would do a little bit using it.

41:41.180 --> 41:48.200
I'm glad I mentioned that book because I've never had any feedback from anybody else that read it, and I thought it was a neat theory.

41:48.360 --> 41:56.000
I don't believe it, but it sure sounds nice, and I was glad to see it in your book. I thought that might have been where it came from or that helped.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
I don't know if I have enough originality to think of it differently, so...

42:02.300 --> 42:11.960
Okay, now I have another sort of trivia question. Since I read either for the first time or reread, are your works together in a pretty short period of time?

42:12.080 --> 42:20.980
One thing I couldn't help noticing, I started counting them, and about 29 people in the books that you've published have red hair.

42:22.900 --> 42:28.140
I was just going to make that comment and see if that was something conscious or something...

42:28.140 --> 42:35.280
I'm sure that's not conscious, except, well, I have had red-haired friends, of course, and I have known many people with red hair.

42:36.560 --> 42:49.600
Whether or not... well, I suppose I could always do an analysis and see how many people have red hair, how many people have blonde hair, how many people have black hair, how many people are Caucasian, how many people are black, and so forth.

42:49.600 --> 42:59.040
If I did a whole list of these things, I don't know if they would reflect their proportions in the population enough, and I don't know if it really matters.

42:59.520 --> 43:04.840
I don't know if I have more redheads in there than are in the population as a whole. Maybe I do.

43:06.420 --> 43:11.420
No, I just had to ask that. I noticed it, and I didn't know if there was some secret signal there.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.780
I didn't know there were that many.

43:15.380 --> 43:24.300
Okay, I kind of want to switch tracks here. You are better known in some circles as an editor and an anthologist.

43:24.940 --> 43:28.360
I think that's something that science fiction fans know very little about.

43:28.980 --> 43:40.460
So could you give us kind of a cradle to grave description of how one goes about editing a book from the idea to getting the people to do it for you?

43:40.460 --> 43:41.820
You think we ought to change tapes?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.980
As for how long this answer is going to be.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.820
Okay, well this will be a long answer or a short answer.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.680
Oh, well maybe you better change.

43:49.800 --> 43:53.880
Let's change tapes. We've got about five, three minutes worth of tape.

43:54.220 --> 43:55.460
Okay, tape's being changed.
