00:01.400 --> 00:03.620
Okay, first of all, yeah, we're going.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.400
Okay, the Science Fiction Writers Association.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.240
Right. Well, America, I'm sorry, Science Fiction Writers of America.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.160
Okay, why did you want the job as president?

00:17.260 --> 00:19.000
Why did I want the job as president?

00:20.460 --> 00:24.080
I don't know. That's really a hard question to answer.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.340
I don't know. Somebody had to do it because I thought I was the most qualified person to do it at the time.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.740
I got about it because I've been involved in the organization

00:33.740 --> 00:36.600
from the beginning. I've been vice president. I've been the grievance chairman.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.140
And I've always, from time to time, felt that I was going off in wrong and stupid directions.

00:41.680 --> 00:46.380
And finally, I felt that there were a certain number of things that I could get done in this period.

00:46.420 --> 00:50.020
And then this was the time to do it. I always felt I was going to be president of the thing sooner or later.

00:50.980 --> 00:53.040
And then this just seemed to be the right time to do it.

00:54.060 --> 00:57.700
Jack Williams had been president and he had dealt with a lot of internal bickering.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.560
And things like that, which I wasn't interested in dealing with at all. I think one of the flaws

01:01.560 --> 01:06.280
of the organization had always been that it was too inward looking. And I wanted to see it more outward looking.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.700
So we had to jack it down with the good deal with organizational stuff.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.400
I felt it was a good time for me to come in and change the emphasis.

01:13.780 --> 01:18.060
Okay, could you just tell me a little bit about what kind of things would you be interested in doing or changing?

01:19.460 --> 01:25.180
Well, I'm interested in... Well, one thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is the internationalized.

01:25.180 --> 01:29.280
It's to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of directors.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.960
And because science fiction, writing and publishing really is an international community,

01:33.340 --> 01:38.480
American writers sell their work all over the world. English writers sell their work here.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.960
Foreign language writers have different problems.

01:41.180 --> 01:45.320
And in the world dealing with the same publishers, it certainly is an international literature

01:45.320 --> 01:50.500
and it's the spirit of the future and the spirit of internationalism. So, of course, I felt it should be an international organization.

01:51.100 --> 01:55.460
That's one thing. Another thing that I want to do when I'm halfway through doing

01:55.460 --> 01:59.400
is upgrading the Nebula Awards. We have moved it out of the World Rec Hotel.

01:59.560 --> 02:04.880
We're moving into a much bigger room in the world. We're trying to make it into a more significant event than it has been.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.620
Again, orienting it towards the world at large rather than towards the little in group.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.000
Another thing that I would like to do with it is make it back more like a union.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.280
We have been, you know, it has evolved in that direction. We now have a large, completely grievance committee.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.960
We do act like a union in that sense. Times are getting rough now.

02:25.140 --> 02:29.360
It's time when you need a, you know, a more militant, killed,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.580
assigned fiction writer that you need in the past few years.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.040
I've tried to orient it a little bit more in that direction too.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.700
Those are the basic things that I, you know, that I want to do with it.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.080
The ways I want to see it go.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.760
Okay. Listen, David wanted me to ask you this. Who would we see about? We want to go to WorldCon.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.460
It's going to be in Denver, we understand, next year. How does one go about registering for that?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.760
Well, I don't know.
