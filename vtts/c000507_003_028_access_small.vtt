00:01.580 --> 00:03.280
The trading off.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.880
Different design parameters.

00:08.180 --> 00:13.560
In other words, a system that's designed to be good in a particular area is usually

00:13.560 --> 00:14.540
pretty bad in others.

00:15.280 --> 00:22.260
A high level interceptor jet has got excellent speed and maneuverability, but it's not much

00:22.260 --> 00:23.160
good for hauling freight.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.940
The school bus is pretty good for getting kids to school, but it won't win many trophies

00:28.940 --> 00:29.920
on a racing circuit.

00:32.780 --> 00:39.940
Blind lights, whatever you're designing for, you try and trade off things so that the specification

00:39.940 --> 00:46.580
is maximized towards getting done the things that you want the system to do.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.380
The panel fears that you pay, you pay in areas that you don't want it to do.

00:55.660 --> 01:04.020
Some systems are designed to be a compromise, they're designed to do a wide range of things

01:04.580 --> 01:08.680
moderately well, although I suppose you could argue that they excel in versatility.

01:09.540 --> 01:13.520
Probably the most versatile system that we know is the human brain.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.140
It can do pretty well anything to a degree.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.140
We're never satisfied with its performance in any one area.

01:21.540 --> 01:28.580
We're continually building things like microscopes, telescopes, and calculating machines to improve

01:28.580 --> 01:29.700
its scope.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.060
Each one of those additional devices will excel the human brain by many orders of magnitude

01:38.260 --> 01:42.360
in its own field of specialty and be absolutely useless for anything else.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.220
I believe Daryl has a few questions.

01:49.520 --> 01:55.140
The point I was leading up to is that the human brain needs to be specialized in versatility.

01:57.340 --> 02:04.860
It might well be that one of nature's basic trade-offs is that thinking big and thinking

02:04.860 --> 02:06.440
small are mutually exclusive.

02:07.420 --> 02:14.300
When you lift your arm to comb your hair, it requires the coordinated action of about

02:14.300 --> 02:15.720
40 separate muscles.

02:16.380 --> 02:23.900
If you have to consciously monitor every step of that sequence to lift your arm, you

02:23.900 --> 02:25.080
wouldn't get much else done.

02:26.420 --> 02:31.380
You certainly wouldn't build many cities or compose many symphonies or really be very

02:31.380 --> 02:34.340
much of a high-level intelligent being at all.

02:34.940 --> 02:40.720
It seems pretty inescapable that in the course of evolution what actually happens in practice

02:40.720 --> 02:47.400
is when you lift your arm, a one-high-level command triggers off a whole sequence of micro-instructions

02:47.400 --> 02:52.700
that are micro-coded into the nervous system, which is analogous to many computer operations

02:52.700 --> 02:53.200
to date.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.580
And you just think one thought consciously and the rest just takes place without any

02:59.580 --> 03:01.220
further intervention on your part.

03:02.120 --> 03:08.160
And it's easy to see the survival value of a process like that, where it would be reinforced

03:08.160 --> 03:09.540
in the process of evolution.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.420
So that the level at which the human brain is mechanical.

03:15.940 --> 03:22.140
A lot of arguments against artificial intelligence, as I heard, they make the point that a computer

03:22.140 --> 03:27.940
is deterministic, that its circuits function exactly the way they're programmed mechanically

03:27.940 --> 03:34.300
and that they don't have any variability or whimsical behavior built into them.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.740
But at its basic hardware level, this is true of the human brain also.

03:38.740 --> 03:44.200
The basic neuron of the brain is every bit as mechanical as an integrated circuit chip.

03:45.100 --> 03:51.560
If the inputs, the sum of the inputs that are applied to it exceed a certain threshold,

03:51.840 --> 03:52.460
it will fire.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.240
And if they don't, it won't.

03:55.880 --> 04:02.360
The variability becomes manifest through the complexity of the organization at a far

04:02.360 --> 04:03.900
higher level, software if you will.

04:05.540 --> 04:12.720
But we, as thinking conscious totalities, we manipulate abstract symbols that represent

04:12.720 --> 04:18.160
the world that we perceive and the world we live in, such as places, people, emotions,

04:18.460 --> 04:18.720
things.

04:19.640 --> 04:27.060
We are not consciously aware of the mechanically precise hardware level of operation of our

04:27.060 --> 04:30.260
brains, in other words, our neurons, or even that we have any.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.540
Whereas it was shut off from that level of operation.

04:34.160 --> 04:40.100
An interesting thought is that if we ever built a system that was capable of emulating

04:40.100 --> 04:46.480
the human brain in all its variety of versatility, we might find that one of the trade-offs that

04:46.480 --> 04:52.600
it pays for being that versatile and that general is that it gets shut off from its

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
hardware level too.

04:54.060 --> 04:59.940
And it can't calculate, it can't remember the word of conversation it had last week.

05:03.940 --> 05:09.620
And perhaps if it wanted to calculate pi to a couple of thousand decimal places, it

05:09.620 --> 05:11.960
would have to build itself a computer or buy one.

05:13.340 --> 05:16.820
That's another good reason for imagining that many of you wouldn't call it a computer

05:16.820 --> 05:17.200
anymore.

05:18.180 --> 05:24.900
Perhaps we should call it a biologically reproduced artificial intelligence.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.280
And since computer people delight in acronyms, that would soon be short to brain, which

05:30.280 --> 05:31.440
would describe it pretty well.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.040
You planned that, didn't you?

05:39.340 --> 05:41.580
I wrote it somewhere in an article a while ago.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.400
Thank you, Mike.

05:44.220 --> 05:47.240
All right, here are some short questions which we may use as inserts.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.640
I'll try and keep the answer short.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.960
No, that's okay.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.700
Which novel is your best-selling novel?

05:56.420 --> 06:02.100
In Herod the Stars because it's been on sale the longest and been translated into the most

06:02.100 --> 06:02.500
languages.

06:03.140 --> 06:22.240
So it's a salt the most top is that the rate of the more recent ones are selling at a faster

06:22.240 --> 06:28.040
rate than Inheritor Stars did when it was first released, if that makes sense.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.340
Do you think you could write a fantasy story?

06:38.460 --> 06:44.940
Yeah, but I don't know if it would be what a lot of people have in mind when they used

06:44.940 --> 06:45.640
the word fantasy.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.520
I discussed this with a number of editors.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.580
I suppose we ought to try and agree on the definition of fantasy, firstly.

06:54.580 --> 07:05.720
I would offer that my interpretation of fantasy would be stories setting, times or places

07:06.240 --> 07:13.060
in which the laws of cause and effect don't work the way they do in the universe we know

07:13.780 --> 07:16.860
and they're not simple extrapolations from the laws we know.

07:17.600 --> 07:24.860
In other words magic works or something akin to magic.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.520
In fact phenomena happen which to us would be inexplicable by our laws of physics and

07:31.520 --> 07:33.820
cause and effect and we would have to describe as magic.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.460
Is that a reasonably acceptable definition of what fantasy is?

07:39.580 --> 07:40.520
I believe so.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.440
Yeah, I would say that.

07:44.240 --> 07:54.280
If we're going to write in that realm I would submit that surely the opportunities for...

07:54.280 --> 07:55.960
Well, it's a science fiction firstly.

07:57.620 --> 08:04.920
The term itself is new but the purpose it serves and the way it serves it is not really.

08:05.980 --> 08:13.420
People from the beginnings of history have had a need or a need for a reason.

08:15.960 --> 08:28.440
They've got enjoyment from escaping for a while out of their own humdrum lives, their own humdrum places.

08:28.820 --> 08:30.980
They're going to places new and places different.

08:33.350 --> 08:43.160
And writers who've enjoyed or storytellers have been able to use the stretch to imagine

08:43.440 --> 08:50.860
and exercise their creativity if they were able to break out of the limitations that are imposed

08:50.860 --> 08:59.780
by geography and history as they are and the conventions and laws of society as they happen to exist.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.780
In other words you can do so much more if you never mind the constraints of how things are.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.780
Let's imagine they might be somewhere else.

09:10.040 --> 09:16.820
In centuries gone by when the world was only partly explored it was easy to do this by simply inventing places.

09:17.800 --> 09:25.140
I don't think Gulliver's travels or the Arabian night or the Eastern island in the Pacific or an unexplored part of South America.

09:26.220 --> 09:31.960
But of course in these days with the whole world mapped and surveyed by satellites you really can't do that credibly.

09:31.960 --> 09:41.440
And the only dimensions left in which the writer can create new worlds and shed those constraints are the dimensions of space and time

09:41.440 --> 09:42.740
which really gives us science fiction.

09:44.840 --> 09:49.720
And if we agree on that I then suggest that the fantasy writer goes one step further.

09:50.600 --> 09:58.860
The fantasy writer not only discards the constraints of history and geography and society

09:59.560 --> 10:02.820
as they happen to exist in the real world.

10:03.460 --> 10:10.060
The fantasy writer also discards the constraints of the laws of physics as they operate in the real world.

10:11.600 --> 10:20.600
And my conclusion from that would be that if the opportunity for originality, creativity,

10:21.960 --> 10:30.180
imagination to explore to its limit exist anywhere they should surely exist in the field of fantasy.

10:31.060 --> 10:36.260
The opportunity is for true originality greater in the other branch of literature.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.320
And yet I find it rather disappointing or rather surprising.

10:40.320 --> 10:50.380
And yet time and time and time again we see the same symbols as people in probes and medieval hats

10:50.380 --> 10:56.860
that went out of style here hundreds of years ago living in tax cottages and waving swords around.

10:57.900 --> 11:03.200
It seems to me that that opportunity is not being exploited at all in a lot of cases anyway.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.560
And a number of editors have asked me to write fantasy and I said well I think about it.

11:11.000 --> 11:19.760
If I did I think I would try and use that opportunity as I think it can be and should be, it could be used.

11:20.900 --> 11:26.480
If we're just retelling medieval fairy tales I think it's almost fantasy under false pretenses.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.080
It's not really recognizing or realizing the potential of what fantasy really is.

11:36.460 --> 11:43.700
I believe if you did write a fantasy novel it would be a different type than a lot of fantasy writers are used to reading.

11:44.040 --> 11:48.440
Yeah I think it would. Whether that would be popular or not I don't know.

11:48.660 --> 11:53.780
And if I'd asked at this stage what would it be about the only answer is I have the same as I did if I hadn't thought about it.

11:54.880 --> 12:06.220
But if I did sit down and seriously think about doing something in that area it would be with the considerations that I've just outlined taken into account.

12:07.900 --> 12:12.120
What might come out of it wouldn't necessarily know if it was that obvious. I suppose it wouldn't be fantasy.

12:17.540 --> 12:23.840
Right. Has anybody approached you about movie rights to any of your novels so far?

12:24.360 --> 12:28.600
Yeah we've talked to a number of companies to date and nothing's come out of it.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.880
Any particular story in particular?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.800
Oh inherit the stars, two faces, mainly.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.820
I'd love to see inherit the stars.

12:41.460 --> 12:48.340
So with regards to the future maybe I think is the only safe thing to say at this stage.

12:49.720 --> 12:57.160
We don't take that as an indication that anything is positively moving on that front at this point in time as far as I know where it is.

12:57.880 --> 13:02.560
Yeah I was just curious. This is what we part of the show. This just goes in our information file.

13:03.400 --> 13:10.540
We keep all the tapes that we tape, the master tapes are unedited. We copy them off on a copy tapes and edit those.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.920
Are we in interview time now or is this just chit chat?

13:14.200 --> 13:26.240
This is just chit chat.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.840
The disaster movie was about a year ago, more wish me to that.

13:30.940 --> 13:39.100
Sometime ago was getting quite interested in two faces of tomorrow but I think in the end he decided not to go ahead.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.940
But now that's life.

13:41.380 --> 13:48.620
Yeah my own impression is, this is of course my own opinion, Erwin Allen has never been able to handle science fiction.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.460
He has never really got a grasp of it.

13:51.460 --> 13:58.160
Well I haven't been very impressed if we're not being broadcasted, this is just between us.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.920
I'm not very impressed by many science fiction movies to be honest.

14:02.080 --> 14:08.060
Yeah, just out of curiosity, which out of the science fiction movies would you find impressive?

14:08.860 --> 14:09.260
Which one?

14:09.540 --> 14:09.780
Yeah.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.740
I missed the question. Which ones are like?

14:11.960 --> 14:15.420
Which ones would you think would be a good science fiction movie?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.240
Out of the books.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.960
No, out of the movies.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.940
What do you think would be a good science fiction movie?

14:22.440 --> 14:23.340
Which movies were good?

14:23.680 --> 14:23.860
Yes.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.760
I haven't seen many of them, mainly because I don't like the ones I did see.

14:27.620 --> 14:34.660
I remember being very impressed by 2001,

14:37.100 --> 14:46.460
bearing in mind that it came out sometime around the mid-victus and I thought that the technical detail and the authenticity was exceptional.

14:46.460 --> 14:55.460
And I was on the edge of my feet looking forward to the whole thing to develop into a really crisp story with a...

14:57.940 --> 15:03.140
I must confess, I was a little bit down, I didn't understand the ending. I don't know what happened.

15:04.280 --> 15:09.260
You went into this abstract symbolic kind of thing and it didn't mean anything to me.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.660
I had dinner one night without the clock and I said,

15:11.660 --> 15:14.900
Arthur, what is the ending of 2001? And he said, I don't know.

15:16.600 --> 15:23.380
I do break in the various movie people wanted to end it one way and somebody wanted to end it another way.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.500
Arthur said he just walked away and left them to it and he never understood what they ended up with either.

15:28.100 --> 15:38.700
So I think that kind of accounts for what puts to rest a lot of the very, very ingenious interpretations about this and doing some of the most people.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.720
I hadn't heard that story before. I'm going to remember that one.

15:44.900 --> 15:56.440
In fact, it's just a really no secret because I told Arthur this that 2001 was one of the factors that inspired me to write Inherit the Stars.

15:56.980 --> 16:04.700
I loved the idea of something being found, a mystery, being uncovered in the course of lunar exploration

16:04.700 --> 16:10.560
that was sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling it.

16:11.520 --> 16:19.340
It seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to write.

16:20.020 --> 16:25.180
You know, okay, let's have the detective story or the mystery that the detectives are trying to solve

16:25.700 --> 16:27.980
hinge around something that's turned up on the moon.

16:28.540 --> 16:32.520
Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories.

16:34.900 --> 16:39.840
It ought to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller.

16:40.080 --> 16:46.100
So let's make it 50,000 years old in human, which raises the whole, opens up the whole bag of worms.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.340
And let's just see how they are made of that.

16:48.340 --> 17:02.460
And I wanted the ending to be a bit of a twist, a bit of a surprise, but nevertheless plausible and rational within the context of the story.

17:02.540 --> 17:13.240
I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or strange laws of physics or anything like this to hold it together.

17:13.240 --> 17:25.900
And you did what every good mystery writer does is give the reader enough information to solve the mystery himself if he's got the perception to do it.

17:26.020 --> 17:33.260
I think so. I think that's on this fiction too. I think Tony Suspense cheating and holding back information from the reader.

17:34.260 --> 17:45.520
Don't even have good fiction. I think that writers who do that because they're trying to create an atmosphere of mystery and make the reader curious.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.400
I don't think that's a fair way of going about it.

17:49.480 --> 17:55.800
I think you think in fairness is the courtesy to the reader. The reader should know as much as the characters know.

17:57.320 --> 18:03.440
And I think it's kind of weak where you know the character knows something and the writer won't tell you what it is.

18:03.960 --> 18:09.420
He's almost playing games with the reader. You know, I know something you don't know. That's not fair.

18:09.540 --> 18:15.740
I think that this information becomes available to the characters so the reader should become aware of it.

18:16.140 --> 18:19.580
So the reader has the same opportunity as the character to figure it out.

18:21.180 --> 18:35.920
And the suspense and the reader's curiosity should be aroused by more skillful methods than simply depriving them of information and keeping them guessing.

18:36.640 --> 18:44.820
Well, appeasing them. Yes, they should be kept guessing but not by being cheated.

18:48.660 --> 18:55.720
Yeah, I may have to retract my statement here about this not being used. That was such an extraordinarily good answer.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.120
We may incorporate that into a future program.

18:58.340 --> 19:03.480
Oh, sure. Yeah, I mean if you want to use that, that's fine. It's just when we were mentioning names like Arthur Clark and Irwin Allen.

19:04.280 --> 19:08.140
I think if we're going out in public, I'd rather just edit those out.

19:08.140 --> 19:17.640
Oh yeah, that's no problem. Now the thing on mystery writing, because we're going to eventually produce a program on science fiction detective stories because there aren't a whole lot of them.

19:19.360 --> 19:26.260
And since we'll have this on our information tape, if we ever do, we'll call you up and tell you that we're doing it and then we'll send you a copy tape of it.

19:26.260 --> 19:37.040
Well, I trust you integrity. But if we're talking about personal things that were said over lunch in confidence, I prefer not to go public.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.220
No, we wouldn't do that.

19:39.500 --> 19:39.720
Okay.

19:43.860 --> 19:46.400
Well, I've exhausted my supply of questions.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.600
Just personally, I happen to enjoy your work very, very much.

19:54.320 --> 19:54.940
Thank you.

19:55.580 --> 20:08.900
In fact, one of the things that, oh yeah, our students in our science fiction class that we're teaching this semester at the college are reading your novel Inherit the Stars as one of the novels for the class.

20:09.040 --> 20:09.840
I'm great to hear it.

20:11.120 --> 20:18.400
And this radio show will be aired the weekend before they meet in class. So they'll be hearing these conversations before we talk about it in class.

20:18.760 --> 20:18.980
Fine.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.820
It just so happens that it works out that way.

20:21.820 --> 20:28.520
Well, you can tell them if they enjoy it, they like the gentle giants, then there's a third one in the pipeline and it'll be out in general.

20:30.020 --> 20:39.120
Now, yeah, we've remarked that on some instances after reading some of your stuff, I wonder if we just can't go out the radio shack and buy enough parts to build some of those things.

20:40.820 --> 20:42.240
I get a lot of that, I don't like that.

20:44.080 --> 20:53.080
But I think it is rewarding that your comment on learning is one that appears frequently as well.

20:54.280 --> 21:04.160
That people do seem to find this kind of fiction stimulating and that it gives them the urge to want to get up and get out, do something meaningful.

21:04.860 --> 21:08.280
And, well, surely that's a good thing.

21:09.260 --> 21:20.720
I think my own observation would be that we're so bombarded by war and things that are going wrong and things don't work out.

21:21.580 --> 21:26.540
And yet in your novel, as you show a society that if you work at it, things can work out.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.180
I don't think that's what I'm trying to say. I think it could, I think it can.

21:31.060 --> 21:39.760
It doesn't guarantee that it will. I think there is a borderline between optimism and naive innocence.

21:41.560 --> 21:53.040
I think it's kind of healthily optimistic to recognize that we, I think we have it in our, in our, our future lives entirely in our own hands.

21:53.040 --> 22:02.860
But it's no, it's not a new observation these days to look out across the size of the universe we live in.

22:04.120 --> 22:12.360
And even really the pictures that we see through the palomar telescope and things like that really don't convey the vastness.

22:12.860 --> 22:20.240
Our own galaxy is contained something like a couple of hundred billion stars, I believe.

22:21.240 --> 22:29.360
It's 100,000 light years in diameter, light would say to 100,000 years to cross just our galaxy.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.080
And that sounds what it is, an unimaginable distance.

22:34.500 --> 22:39.620
And yet that galaxy, there are all galaxies that anybody can count.

22:40.100 --> 22:44.500
Fertile and star, the number of galaxies is just beyond counting.

22:44.500 --> 22:54.610
And the best analogy that modern science can come up with of the universe is that of a gas of galaxy molecules.

22:56.740 --> 23:03.960
Imagine the number of molecules swirling around in the room that you're sitting in.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.880
And imagine every one of those is a galaxy.

23:06.660 --> 23:10.200
And every one of those galaxies contains their hundred billion stars.

23:12.220 --> 23:16.260
And you happen to be on a little ball of mud that's attached to one of them.

23:17.100 --> 23:24.640
You know, you ain't much and I don't really feel anything intimidating about this.

23:25.080 --> 23:30.340
Yeah, we're insignificant in terms of the universe, but look at it in another way.

23:30.520 --> 23:34.040
It is very exhilarating and very liberating.

23:35.140 --> 23:43.180
Because what it really says is that we are not cogs in a clockwork machine that somebody has programmed the rules for.

23:43.940 --> 23:49.500
That we're doomed or not, depending on somebody else's whim.

23:50.480 --> 23:59.540
That we are a totally self-sufficient, self-determining species.

24:01.860 --> 24:07.740
And the limits to expansion and growth around us, potentially, are limitless.

24:09.080 --> 24:21.240
There are no limits, I believe, to how far and how high the human species can expand, both in terms of how far it can travel and the things it can achieve.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.620
I think it's entirely up to us.

24:28.240 --> 24:43.000
And I think it's an exercise in self-deception to rely on big brothers in the sky or magical forces to solve our problems for us or make our problems go away.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.840
They won't.

24:46.040 --> 24:53.020
But the realization that we have the ability and the opportunity to do it, I find it very exciting.

24:53.620 --> 25:01.900
But if we make a mess of it, and there's no guarantee that we won't, there's certainly no doubt that the universe won't miss us.

25:02.400 --> 25:07.980
If that one little speck of dust vanishes, the rest of the gas of galaxies isn't even going to see the difference.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.100
So it really is entirely up to us.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.260
And we hear a lot of talk about freedom these days.

25:17.260 --> 25:23.560
And of course, freedom and responsibility are different sides of the same coin.

25:24.180 --> 25:36.460
If you are totally free to determine your course of action and nobody places any constraints on you, then by the same token, you are responsible for the consequences of those actions.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.720
And I think we've got that coin.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.440
I think we are totally free to do anything we choose.

25:42.820 --> 25:44.080
There are no constraints.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.120
There are no limits.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.340
I think we have the potential.

25:48.280 --> 26:05.840
And we all have the responsibility to ourself, I think that's the thing that as a race we need to wake up to and acknowledge because with the levels of power that we're beginning to harness and play with, it's becoming a very serious issue.

26:06.600 --> 26:22.540
I don't think the solution is to run away from the responsibility and go back to playing with windmills or wood burning stoves or that primitive level to the existence of some people would advocate that we do.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.260
I think that's an abdication.

26:25.460 --> 26:45.640
I think we need to realize that the next run upwards on the ladder of evolution that we're on requires us to comprehend those forces that we're beginning to understand and learn how to use them responsibly.

26:48.600 --> 27:00.360
And I think that all the, when you mentioned war a little while ago, yes, we have the potential to wipe ourselves out.

27:00.580 --> 27:09.160
And I think we also, on the other side of the coin, we also have the ability to solve the problems that a war would otherwise be fought over.

27:09.160 --> 27:35.800
It doesn't make sense to me to talk about fighting a global war over a little bit of oil under the desert, few metals and mineral wars in South Africa or something like that, because the little pockets of energy that happens to be trapped around the surface of this permit are just our investment capital for starting the business.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.240
No business has to run forever on its investment capital.

27:40.740 --> 27:46.520
If that's just your startup capital, you invest that and make the profit to pay your way as your business grows and expands.

27:47.820 --> 27:52.660
And I think that's true with energy and with other resources too.

27:52.660 --> 27:59.300
I think resources only finite within the context of a given level of technology.

28:00.340 --> 28:10.740
And when you go through a, when civilization goes through a phase change into the higher level of technology, the level of the resources that were previously finite, seems to be relevant.

28:10.980 --> 28:11.660
It doesn't matter anymore.

28:12.600 --> 28:26.940
The economy's history depended on animal power, slaves, horses, how much wood you could carry and limited the extent to which earlier economies could be stretched.

28:27.580 --> 28:31.540
They're totally irrelevant in the context of today's high technology economy.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.720
We worry about oil and gas and things.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.260
I think, yes, they're finite and yes, they won't last forever.

28:37.400 --> 28:46.620
I don't think it matters a damn because we're likely to, we could see, into technologies far more advanced in which fossil fuels are simply irrelevant.

28:46.920 --> 28:51.080
It's just not worth the cost or the messing around and drilling them out the ground anymore.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.220
I think that could happen long before they run out.

28:54.280 --> 29:06.340
I don't particularly see that as an area to get concerned over unless people become trapped in the straight jacket of their own narrow short-term thinking.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.420
And believe it's worth fighting the war over, I don't think it is.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.640
Which is, again, it's not to say that everybody will see it that way.

29:16.720 --> 29:26.340
Yeah, I think lots of times we probably end up being manipulated by the media that we are bombarded with all the time.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.340
So I missed that, Dave.

29:29.120 --> 29:33.020
Lots of times I think we're manipulated by the media that we're bombarded with all the time.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.640
You know, the newspapers and the TV.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.780
I'm sure a lot of this goes on.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.720
I'm not so sure that as much of it goes on, as some people seem to think.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.940
I'm sure a lot of it does.

29:44.100 --> 29:50.860
I'm sure a lot of vested interests are tied up with stretching our existing technologies for a little while longer yet.

29:51.080 --> 30:03.220
A lot of money has been invested in refineries and tankers and mining rights and drilling rights and that kind of thing.

30:04.200 --> 30:09.660
I'm sure it's in the interest of a lot of powerful lobbies to keep us using those things for a while longer yet.

30:09.660 --> 30:12.640
I don't really see that as sinister or unethical.

30:12.820 --> 30:16.300
I suppose it is in some ways, but it's put business sense in other ways.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.920
We're taking the long term view.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.600
I think that when the need gets acute enough, then we'll solve the problem.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.200
I have no doubt we have the ability to do it.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.460
I just hope that happens before anybody starts pressing buttons.

30:29.980 --> 30:30.240
Right.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.560
Yeah, I think it will too.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.340
I think one of the best examples I could think of is, I believe it was Brazil.

30:36.880 --> 30:37.100
Yeah.

30:37.100 --> 30:44.100
They converted all their cars, most of their gas using cars to alcohol.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.700
Ford Motor Company is making the cars for them.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.380
And they did that.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.320
Of course, they have a fairly efficient form of government.

30:53.480 --> 30:53.860
It's a dictatorship.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.820
Yeah, I don't think it could work.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.440
They have a different economic framework.

31:00.680 --> 31:01.980
It wouldn't work in the United States.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.660
They have a stricter form of government.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.040
They have the lower wages.

31:09.380 --> 31:13.420
I hesitate to use the word peasants because of its derogatory connotations.

31:13.740 --> 31:21.880
But a lot of human labor goes into harvesting the cane and the biomass that makes the alcohol.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.560
And human labor that is cheap and freely available, that low wages.

31:26.380 --> 31:29.540
And you can sell it at the pumps, as far as yesterday, to sell it in this country.

31:29.540 --> 31:32.800
Where do you get your army of laborers to harvest the stuff here?

31:33.880 --> 31:36.140
I think it's a very inefficient solution to the problem anyway.

31:36.840 --> 31:43.040
But the value of liquid fuels, of course, is big that they provide terminal storage of energy.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.620
And they are portable and highly concentrated.

31:46.060 --> 31:53.460
I think that our high technology know-how and our investment capital will be far better

31:53.460 --> 32:00.300
put into developing nuclear processes flared out and using hydrogen-based economy.

32:01.660 --> 32:08.180
Yeah, I was reading something in whole as either popular mechanics or one of them.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.760
Theoretical hydrogen powered cars.

32:14.180 --> 32:17.500
Sure. I think lucky to experiment with hydrogen-fueled aircraft.

32:18.340 --> 32:18.900
Yeah, they are.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.640
I think there are some problems.

32:23.860 --> 32:33.880
This may have changed, but from something I read a while ago, I think that the storage efficiency in terms of the calories you store per pound weight,

32:35.060 --> 32:36.980
not as high as you get from gasoline.

32:37.440 --> 32:44.580
But I would think with the kind of development capital that they've been talking about up until recently anyway,

32:44.580 --> 32:53.320
about putting into converting coal and things like that to liquids, in what my opinion is a lot of nonsense.

32:54.420 --> 32:58.080
I think it would probably improve the importance of a hydrogen fuel.

32:59.160 --> 33:06.480
A lot of people produce a lot of sums about to show you how much energy you could get from this source or that source.

33:06.480 --> 33:13.440
But a very important quantity that is not mentioned and recognized often enough is energy density.

33:15.180 --> 33:30.100
The density at which you harness energy is a very important indicator of how efficiently the efficiency of the process is you can get smarter things done more efficiently.

33:31.660 --> 33:41.660
For instance, as an example, a simple arithmetic would enable you to calculate how much wood you'd need to burn to lift 300 people across the Atlantic,

33:42.420 --> 33:46.080
or to release the energy to lift 300 people across the Atlantic.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.340
But now it's like building a wood burning 747.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.580
It won't work.

33:51.300 --> 33:52.520
It's just not dense enough.

33:53.580 --> 34:04.000
You need jet fuel, a far more highly concentrated form, to make power plants small enough and light enough to lift themselves in a payload off the ground.

34:05.400 --> 34:14.320
Now the density of nuclear processes is millions of times higher, and in the case of fusion theoretically,

34:14.320 --> 34:19.700
it's billions of times higher than anything you could get from rupturing any chemical bond.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.660
And I think it's a primary energy source.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.700
That's the way we have to go.

34:26.940 --> 34:34.340
And as for storing the energy in a convenient form, for example for transportation,

34:36.100 --> 34:39.880
hydrogen cyanonide or liquid hydrogen or some form of hydrogen based on that,

34:40.960 --> 34:43.920
which is plentiful enough in the oceans.

34:46.220 --> 34:57.280
And if you look beyond, people think of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion as just another way of running a generating plant, but it's not.

34:58.230 --> 35:12.220
It is a kind of a breakthrough into a whole realm of potential technologies that have the promise of streamlining and cleaning up and generally compacting a whole range of industrial processes.

35:14.080 --> 35:22.400
For example, at the temperature of nuclear plasmas, sea water cracks firmly into hydrogen and oxygen.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.840
Far more efficiently than it can be achieved by electrolysis.

35:29.500 --> 35:37.460
So as a byproduct of a nuclear process, you have the possibility of producing very, very cheap hydrogen on an industrial scale.

35:38.120 --> 35:46.340
De-savination of sea water is another possibility, which this year we've seen the water problems associated with industry and agriculture.

35:47.320 --> 35:51.920
Producing lots of fresh water and the energy to pump into places is needed.

35:52.820 --> 35:58.660
It is another whole area that is opened up when you can control energy and this volume and this density.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.620
Primary metals extraction is another.

36:03.320 --> 36:15.300
At the temperature of nuclear plasmas, tens, hundred million degrees Kelvin, any substance breaks down into a raw atomic nuclei where all the electrons stripped off.

36:16.340 --> 36:26.600
Every compound breaks up into a raw nuclear which is highly charged and can therefore be separated very easily and very cheaply, magnetically.

36:27.560 --> 36:40.300
And every kind of desert rock sand construction debris contains traces of aluminum, titanium, copper, manganese, you name it.

36:40.300 --> 36:50.620
Just about every important metal, but it's just not economic to try and extract it by conventional processes that are nuclear temperatures that doesn't apply.

36:51.840 --> 37:01.540
So you can shut shovel desert sand through a magnetic fusion plasma and then separate out the ions magnetically.

37:02.620 --> 37:06.120
And who needs South Africa for minerals? Get it all out of Arizona.

37:07.240 --> 37:18.800
And you have the potential perhaps for obsoleting overnight all of our cumbersome and expensive primary metals processing and extraction industries.

37:19.200 --> 37:25.200
And when you've developed that technology here, you can take it to the moon and that's how you build your space problem is new starships.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.100
Yeah, I hope so.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.420
Didn't we get carried away there?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.240
Yeah, I enjoy getting carried away though.

37:37.860 --> 37:47.840
Yeah, hopefully I've been talking with several writers. I really do enjoy it. It's very interesting to talk with somebody whose book you've read.

37:50.360 --> 37:55.020
And I'm beginning to get the writing bug myself. In fact, I could only spell it would be alright.

37:55.700 --> 38:00.580
Well, like everything else, it's one of those things that nobody was born knowing.

38:01.900 --> 38:05.300
Shakespeare had to learn the spell once and Einstein had to learn to count.

38:06.500 --> 38:06.980
Yeah.

38:08.360 --> 38:11.340
Every expert in anything with a beginner sometime.

38:11.960 --> 38:12.940
A point well taken.

38:13.360 --> 38:16.860
Do you see yourself getting out to California in the foreseeable future?

38:17.740 --> 38:23.380
I don't know. Adele will be out there and I believe he lives less than 100 miles from where you are.

38:23.660 --> 38:33.000
Well, you know, it goes without saying if any of you find yourself over here with some time to spare, you're welcome to call and see if we can get together or something.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.260
Oh yeah, I'd really like that.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.140
So consider that an open invitation if you and your friends are ever around this way.

38:41.380 --> 38:46.820
What if you ever get out toward Texas and in between nowhere and nowhere at all, that's where we are.

38:48.840 --> 38:55.520
Well, I'd throw three Texas three times in November. Always in the middle of the night it seems.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.140
Well, if you drove through the west part, you didn't miss anything. There wasn't anything there to see.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.120
I don't feel for that about it.

39:03.340 --> 39:07.780
Yeah, well actually I take it back. The country out here kind of grows on here.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.940
In fact, I think we probably have some of the most beautiful sunsets they'll ever find anywhere.

39:13.980 --> 39:18.720
Cause of the inversion layers and stuff we get out here. Every color on the rainbow is up in the sky.

39:19.140 --> 39:22.260
Well, you see you're looking west to that and we got them right here.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.700
Yeah, oh yeah, it was dark a long time ago here.

39:31.080 --> 39:34.460
Are you going to be at the World Con in Denver?

39:35.380 --> 39:36.480
I haven't decided yet.

39:37.360 --> 39:44.380
Oh yeah, if you do go we will be there. At least if we have enough money we'll be there.

39:44.800 --> 39:49.840
Yeah, I'm not a, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing but it has to be a fact.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.040
I'm really not a regular convention goer.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.660
I go to some and thoroughly enjoy that my suppose.

40:00.080 --> 40:06.500
Probably the reason is this is just a personal suspicion but I think I got into being a science fiction writer

40:06.500 --> 40:13.520
from probably the diametrically the opposite direction from the majority of science fiction writers.

40:14.420 --> 40:21.140
I think it's more normal for young people to get interested in science fiction

40:21.140 --> 40:26.440
typically through friends at college or university who eventually persuade them to go to a convention.

40:27.540 --> 40:34.080
And in a lot of cases they find an environment they enjoy, they find stimulating people they can relate to and it becomes a habit.

40:35.700 --> 40:42.700
And some of those perform the ambition to want to contribute something to this genre themselves

40:42.700 --> 40:50.040
so they start to write something and submit it. Some of them are lucky and accepted then they try a novel.

40:51.140 --> 40:54.000
And ten years later there is another writer sitting up on the panel.

40:55.100 --> 41:05.180
And of course during that process the convention going to conventions and being part of conventions has already become part of a lifestyle that they've absorbed.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.060
And I really never did.

41:07.820 --> 41:13.440
So I kind of go to them occasionally to see what's happening and to see people and to be sociable.

41:13.440 --> 41:21.980
But I suppose it never started out as part of a pattern of life in years way gone by.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.480
I've never been to a science fiction.

41:24.720 --> 41:31.440
Well I guess you could call this a convention. They're having some sort of Star Trek gizmo and Dallas and I stopped by to see what it was.

41:32.460 --> 41:39.120
But I've never really been to a science fiction convention per se.

41:39.120 --> 41:44.380
Well I went to the world client Boston last year which was, I enjoy them.

41:44.580 --> 41:50.460
The world convention, well the one I've been to was an experience, was pretty huge.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.860
Only 6,000 people there in several hotels.

41:53.700 --> 41:59.620
And you can spend the whole damn weekend looking for one person that you particularly wanted to meet.

42:00.480 --> 42:03.020
They can be pretty overpowering.

42:03.400 --> 42:08.600
I've found the small local ones very enjoyable.

42:09.340 --> 42:13.640
Just sort of one day with a front or two people.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.660
And in that one day you see everybody and talk to everybody.

42:19.860 --> 42:21.320
Frequently a lot of fun too.

42:21.700 --> 42:25.940
Yeah, it is a group that gets together in New Mexico.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.340
We're not too far from New Mexico.

42:29.620 --> 42:33.620
We measure things in Texas distances so it's nothing to go 400 miles to see somebody.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.780
You couldn't drive out of anything without falling off the edge.

42:40.220 --> 42:43.840
And gush into the water and into the channel on the other.

42:45.520 --> 42:49.160
But now people out here don't take anything going to Dallas to go shopping.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.940
Don't even think twice about it.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.840
And how far down is it?

42:56.000 --> 42:56.840
380 miles.

42:56.840 --> 43:00.000
Of course most of the time they fly up there.

43:00.620 --> 43:02.200
Texas has its own airline.

43:02.540 --> 43:06.120
Texas is a strange and wonderful place.

43:07.440 --> 43:11.340
But you can fly up to Dallas and back for 50 bucks.

43:11.660 --> 43:13.300
So people just...

43:13.840 --> 43:17.120
I'm reaching the point where if I have to get in the car it's a long way.

43:17.700 --> 43:23.300
One of the big attractions of moving to the town I'm living in now is...

43:23.300 --> 43:27.940
It's kind of one of those quite old fashioned friendly towns.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.420
About 20,000 to 30,000 people maybe.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.080
But the sidewalks are busy with people.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.100
And shops that are side by side.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.480
And the people stop and talk to you.

43:44.220 --> 43:46.160
And you can walk anywhere.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.300
It isn't like...

43:48.780 --> 43:52.800
I found Orlando was a little like a miniature Los Angeles.

43:53.340 --> 43:55.240
It was like an airport with houses on.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.200
And you couldn't do anything when you're getting in the car.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.620
I like this country.

44:00.820 --> 44:01.740
That's why I came to live here.

44:01.980 --> 44:11.020
But one of the aspects of a lot of Americans that I haven't got used to and don't think I ever will is having to get in the car to do anything.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.100
And it is nice here.

44:13.340 --> 44:17.080
I think 80% of the places I want to go I can just slip a jacket on and walk.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.140
Because we live in the town center.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.500
Our society is built around the car.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.200
I guess that's probably okay if you grew up with it.

44:29.460 --> 44:32.140
It's kind of harder to get used to if you didn't.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.980
I grew up in the center of London.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.960
You can walk anywhere you want to go.

44:37.100 --> 44:40.560
And if you don't want to walk there's lots of buses and lots of chutes and subways.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.580
Most people didn't own a car.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.320
Why did I ever get to London?

44:49.180 --> 44:52.200
I hear people, one person may own a couple of cars.

44:53.320 --> 44:56.260
One person may buy himself two or three cars just to keep him busy.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.240
Not anymore. They get too expensive.

45:01.300 --> 45:02.460
But I don't know.

45:02.780 --> 45:09.520
When I was growing up, when you got 15 or 16 you better start saving your money to get yourself a car.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.940
Shoot you couldn't do anything without a car.

45:12.120 --> 45:12.940
Couldn't go out on a date.

45:12.940 --> 45:17.400
Couldn't go down to the local joint. Couldn't do anything without a car.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.680
Well I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.680
I'm just saying it's kind of different to what I'm used to.

45:22.260 --> 45:27.480
Yeah it's a strange thing we're hooked on over here.

45:29.720 --> 45:33.700
Well I think I've taken up enough of your time here.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.840
Don't worry. What were you about through?

45:37.140 --> 45:40.380
We were through a long time ago. I just enjoyed talking with you.

45:41.040 --> 45:41.900
Well that's okay.
