00:11.160 --> 00:18.240
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.240 --> 00:20.460
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.900
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.860
The subject of this show is space exploration.

00:35.380 --> 00:40.360
We're putting two limitations on that subject. One, that the exploration be outside the solar

00:40.360 --> 00:45.060
system, and two, that the story or novel we discuss involve the process of searching or

00:45.060 --> 00:48.860
exploring primarily, not simply the result of the exploration.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.360
And especially with those limitations, I think we have perhaps the purest of all science

00:53.360 --> 00:58.340
fiction themes or plots. Man's history on this planet has been a process of searching,

00:58.540 --> 01:03.420
discovering, then taming or civilizing. The discovery of the New World, for instance,

01:03.720 --> 01:08.240
was the result of a deliberate act of search by various European explorers, culminating

01:08.240 --> 01:15.080
with Columbus. The American West, as discovered and mapped by Lewis and Clark, is a classic

01:15.080 --> 01:22.220
example of exploration. Now, space, or our galaxy, the universe, is simply the next area

01:22.220 --> 01:27.980
to explore and discover and tame. I think the importance and purity of the theme lies in

01:27.980 --> 01:32.760
the notion that searching and discovering is the very essence of human nature. It's

01:32.760 --> 01:35.920
at the center of our survival instinct. Without it, we wouldn't be human.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.020
We've conquered the frontiers of Earth, and now we're ready to confront, we must confront,

01:42.760 --> 01:45.900
what one influential science fiction production is called the final frontier.

02:37.860 --> 02:43.600
Star Trek first came on the air in 1966 and continued through 1969 with 78 episodes being

02:43.600 --> 02:48.720
completed for the series. The show had several major science fiction authors writing for it,

02:48.760 --> 02:53.780
including Harlan Ellison, Theodore Sturgeon, and David Gerald. It would be hard to think of a

02:53.780 --> 03:00.840
better example of the space exploration theme. I think Star Trek epitomizes that because episode

03:00.840 --> 03:05.180
after episode, you saw the members of, crew members of the Enterprise confront aliens,

03:06.780 --> 03:12.480
all sorts of problems in a hostile universe, but they kept going, their spirit, their courage,

03:12.660 --> 03:19.400
their desire to go beyond mankind's limits almost. It carried the show for a long time,

03:19.480 --> 03:24.520
and I think it sort of is the essence of the space exploration theme, for pure exploration's sake.

03:24.920 --> 03:29.480
It was a fairly popular show when it was on the air, but it gained in popularity considerably

03:29.480 --> 03:34.740
after it went off the air and went into syndication. Conventions are held, Star Trek conventions,

03:35.020 --> 03:40.920
and it eventually spawned a movie. Well fitting in with your parameters on space exploration,

03:41.300 --> 03:46.900
we never saw the Enterprise going on a particular mission to do something in particular. It was

03:46.900 --> 03:53.280
always just out there exploring, and with no particular thing in mind, and whatever happened

03:53.280 --> 03:58.740
to it seemed to happen by accident, or just, it just happened. They were out there in an alien

03:58.740 --> 04:03.320
ship advanced upon them, or they found some planet with a distress signal calling out,

04:03.580 --> 04:08.380
but they were never really going to any particular place as far as we were told.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.360
I believe that really is kind of covered in the preamble to the show, where William Shatner says

04:13.360 --> 04:20.060
they're on that five-year mission to explore new planets and discover what's out there.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.400
I think that has to be one of the reasons the show is so popular again, because simply it

04:26.360 --> 04:33.080
satisfies people's need for the unknown, for the search, for the exploration, to seek something

04:33.080 --> 04:40.580
which is mysterious, which is unknown. It's simply caught the imagination, I think, of more than

04:42.280 --> 04:46.200
pure science fiction fans. I think everybody was fascinated with that kind of theme.

04:46.920 --> 04:51.340
I think this is especially shown in the episode called The Side of Paradise.

04:53.080 --> 04:58.620
Yes, I think they did that theme a number of times, or not a number, but every so often. I think

04:58.620 --> 05:06.080
that particular episode is the best expression of it, but they advanced to this particular planet

05:07.360 --> 05:13.160
and beamed down as they did on their transporters. There was a particular planet on this planet that

05:13.160 --> 05:19.200
shot spores whenever one of the crew members got near it. These spores would seemingly

05:21.440 --> 05:29.660
cause a state of total happiness, total contentment in the individual. He didn't have a sense of

05:29.660 --> 05:35.920
a goal. He didn't want to strive. He simply wanted to stagnate. I'm reminded of the poem by

05:35.920 --> 05:41.920
Tennis and the Lotus Eaters, where the crew of Ulysses ate the lotus plant and wanted to stay on

05:41.920 --> 05:47.680
the island forever without moving, without striving, without trying. Kirk, the captain,

05:47.820 --> 05:54.560
Captain Kirk is one of the few who was not infected by the spores. With the power of his

05:54.560 --> 06:01.360
personality, his cleverness, he is able to overturn the influence these spores have had

06:01.360 --> 06:07.940
in his crew members. I think the significance of it is that they are going to continue. They're

06:07.940 --> 06:12.640
not satisfied. They're not content. They would have been perfectly happy to live the rest of

06:12.640 --> 06:17.960
their existence on this planet. It was sort of an Eden, a paradise, but that's not enough for

06:17.960 --> 06:22.960
people. They need a goal. They need something to strive for, or they're not human. Kirk is able to

06:23.740 --> 06:26.900
get the crew members back to their original states and the enterprise goes on.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.400
For an example of a novel that deals strictly in this type of space exploration, let's turn to

06:34.400 --> 06:41.000
a novel called The Voyage of the Space Beagle. It was written by A. E. Van Vote in 1950. It's actually

06:41.000 --> 06:47.340
a collection of four short stories that he tied together with a new character. The original

06:47.340 --> 06:53.860
short stories were Black Destroyer and Discord and Scarlet written in 1939, M-33 and Andromeda

06:53.860 --> 07:01.800
written in 1943, and War of Nerves written in 1950. These four stories he took and tied together

07:03.060 --> 07:10.460
with the theme of going out and exploring space with these four episodes becoming four things

07:10.460 --> 07:16.940
that happen to the ship and the people on it. In each of the stories, we meet a different kind of

07:16.940 --> 07:23.640
alien and have to deal with it in a life and death situation. The first of these episodes

07:23.640 --> 07:28.380
takes place from the crew lands on an alien planet and is discovered by a creature named Curl.

07:29.560 --> 07:35.260
Curl is a cat-like creature and he soon lures his way on board the ship. The scientists are very

07:35.260 --> 07:41.000
eager to study him and see what his physiological makeup is like and how his psychology has adapted

07:41.000 --> 07:47.220
into this type of planet and generally what he is. Elliot Groesfiner, the main character that ties

07:47.220 --> 07:56.000
the stories together, is somewhat suspect of Curl and his suspicions are well founded. In an

07:56.000 --> 08:03.440
accident they discover that Curl can control electrical energies through his body and once

08:03.440 --> 08:08.820
Curl discovers that the human beings have learned this from him, he becomes immediately very fearful

08:08.820 --> 08:15.900
of them. He's a very very powerful creature and they lock him inside a cage but he manages to

08:17.200 --> 08:23.400
negate the electronic lock and get out and starts horribly killing the crewman

08:24.100 --> 08:29.560
and then running back to the sail and locking him back inside it hoping to create a panic on board

08:29.560 --> 08:37.940
the ship. The crew almost immediately discovers what is happening and becomes a war between the

08:37.940 --> 08:47.240
crew and the creature and in the end Curl leaves the ship by means of a lifeboat because he doesn't

08:47.240 --> 08:52.620
understand the faster than light drive on the ship. He attempts to fly back toward his planet

08:53.400 --> 08:58.320
but he's traveling away from his planet faster than he is traveling toward it when he leaves the

08:58.320 --> 09:02.660
ship and even though he's flying toward his planet his planet still recedes into the distance

09:03.240 --> 09:10.960
and he goes insane trying to figure this out. The second episode in the book which is one of

09:10.960 --> 09:16.780
the original short stories is about a race of aliens that are very bird-like called the rim

09:16.780 --> 09:23.100
or the rim people. They have an entirely mental existence they communicate by telepathy and

09:23.400 --> 09:29.120
they try to contact the space beagle with their mental emanations through telepathy

09:29.620 --> 09:34.780
and they're friendly all they want to do is contact the ship but it creates havoc on the space beagle.

09:36.640 --> 09:42.520
This mental power that enters the spaceship drives some of them in mad it causes psychological

09:42.520 --> 09:48.020
aberrations it brings out hostilities it exaggerates certain mental conditions in the crew

09:49.980 --> 09:55.340
and Grossfiner the the same one who was suspicious of Curl in the previous episode is able

09:55.340 --> 10:03.480
with his specialized equipment to mentally contact the rim to let them know what's happening and

10:03.480 --> 10:07.740
ask them to call off their attack which is done and the space beagle is allowed to continue.

10:08.800 --> 10:15.560
The third section of the book deals with a somewhat different type of alien. The space

10:15.560 --> 10:22.980
beagle is voyaging between galaxies in intergalactic space where there is absolutely nothing when all

10:22.980 --> 10:29.460
of the sudden they come across the path of an alien who seems to be floating in this intergalactic

10:29.460 --> 10:37.160
void. The alien had no hope of ever reaching one of the galaxies he was stranded out there

10:37.580 --> 10:44.020
when this ship just happened to pass by and the alien immediately taps some of the energy from

10:44.020 --> 10:51.880
the drive of the ship and stops the ship dead in its tracks. The humans crawl out of the ship and

10:51.880 --> 10:58.860
fix the exterior and then they notice the alien floating right by the ship. The alien comes aboard

10:58.860 --> 11:06.740
the ship after they try to capture him in a cage and immediately recognizes the situation

11:07.900 --> 11:13.220
as being very advantageous to him. This creature is extremely powerful and he's from an ancient

11:13.220 --> 11:21.480
civilization that existed in the previous cycle of the universe. When that universe exploded this

11:21.480 --> 11:26.760
creature was shot out into the place where they found him without any hope of gaining access to a

11:26.760 --> 11:36.960
galaxy. When he meets the men he is able to use them as host creatures or bodies for his eggs

11:36.960 --> 11:44.680
in order to raise up more of these creatures. The Ixtel as the alien is called in the book

11:45.900 --> 11:52.860
takes over part of the ship and it's really a race between him and the rest of the humans

11:52.860 --> 11:59.120
as to who's going to control. If the humans allow him to gain the upper hand he will eventually

11:59.120 --> 12:04.820
control all of the galaxy that they're going to. The only way that the humans could rid themselves

12:04.820 --> 12:13.760
of Ixtel was by using their mental agility and leaving the ship long enough that they could

12:14.400 --> 12:19.340
impose a force field of energy that would kill the creature. The creature found out what they

12:19.340 --> 12:26.520
were doing just in time to escape and he got back into his original fix floating out in middle of

12:26.520 --> 12:33.460
intergalactic space with no hope of ever gaining access to the galaxy as the humans went on to

12:33.460 --> 12:40.500
their next episode. The last one involves the creature very difficult to describe it's sort of

12:40.500 --> 12:48.100
a cloud a huge cloud creature without any particular name but it feeds on death it started out as a

12:48.100 --> 12:55.660
very small small organism. First of all it fed on the deaths of insects then smaller animals and

12:55.660 --> 13:03.360
larger animals. It kept growing all the while and it's gotten so huge that it needs the the death

13:03.360 --> 13:09.740
of creatures on an entire planet to exist. So it's gained the power and the size and the strength

13:10.300 --> 13:15.320
to terraform planets and as the space people goes through a particular system they find that

13:15.860 --> 13:22.820
all of the planets they're passing are similar. They're covered with tropical vegetation with large

13:23.660 --> 13:29.000
primitive kinds of animals engaged in conflict which leads to to many deaths that this creature is

13:29.000 --> 13:35.500
feeding on. The scientists on the space beagle figure out what's happening and realize that their

13:35.500 --> 13:40.540
own solar system is in great danger because this creature is expanding all the time and they're

13:40.540 --> 13:44.980
afraid it's going to come to their own solar system. So they devise a plan whereby they

13:45.820 --> 13:51.920
they start destroying the planets that the creature is feeding on and lure him out into

13:52.860 --> 13:58.660
interstellar space where he is not allowed where he's not able to feed so that he is going to he

13:58.660 --> 14:05.340
will we know die away from the source of the death which nourishes him. So again through their cleverness

14:05.340 --> 14:11.060
through their ingenuity the the humans have triumphed over an alien which when you come right down to it

14:11.060 --> 14:15.960
is much more powerful than they are. And I believe that typifies a lot of the things in the novel in

14:15.960 --> 14:23.020
that the humans are always overcoming their adversaries by means of their cleverness. They

14:23.320 --> 14:30.680
seem to outwit aliens that are much more powerful than they are physically and in some instances by

14:30.680 --> 14:38.180
specialized powers that they have. Curl could manipulate electromagnetic energies and Ixtel

14:38.180 --> 14:45.620
could move through solid matter but even with these abilities the humans by their own ingenuity

14:45.620 --> 14:50.260
could outwit their adversaries. I think we should say something for the aliens though.

14:51.020 --> 14:56.280
In most of the pulp novels of the time that this one was written we have so many of the bug-eyed

14:56.280 --> 15:02.940
monsters that are nothing more than monsters. Here we have aliens that are truly intelligent and

15:02.940 --> 15:10.160
are fighting the humans on a much greater level than just physical terror. They they're well thought

15:10.160 --> 15:17.780
out. They have purpose and a plan. We can say that these are really better aliens than what you

15:17.780 --> 15:23.700
would expect to find in most of the pulp novels of this time. I think that tradition that change in

15:23.700 --> 15:28.460
the way the bug-eyed monsters were were written about in science fiction came back in the 30s with

15:28.460 --> 15:34.480
Stanley Weinbaum, Martian Odyssey. Asimov is described that as the first science fiction story

15:34.480 --> 15:41.580
in which the aliens are not simply humans in a strange form. They have their own reasons for

15:41.580 --> 15:46.580
existing. They have their own ecology. They they belong to a particular planet and they're part of

15:46.580 --> 15:54.860
that planet. I think all of the aliens in this particular book are the realistic in terms of

15:54.860 --> 15:59.780
having an ecology built around them and having a psychology, a physiology which is not human.

16:01.560 --> 16:07.520
How shall we characterize this novel and is it pulp fiction or is it something superior to that?

16:08.620 --> 16:12.380
Well when Van Vogt started writing the stories he was writing in the pulp tradition. It was still

16:12.380 --> 16:16.040
in the late 30s when he started to write these these stories which became the space beagle.

16:16.660 --> 16:21.120
But I think he goes beyond that. He has a even though he was trained in the pulp tradition I think

16:21.120 --> 16:26.880
he has a more skill. He's more modern perhaps under the influence of the editor John Campbell.

16:27.400 --> 16:32.240
And he's able to go beyond the pulp formulas. These are realistic aliens. The humans in the

16:32.240 --> 16:38.940
book are characterized by by realistic motives. They're not simply the the plain hero types.

16:39.020 --> 16:43.600
They have their quirks. They have their their bad points to humans. In fact they all they all have

16:43.600 --> 16:49.200
to overcome the bad parts of human nature before they can defeat the aliens themselves. So I think

16:49.200 --> 16:55.500
this is a step beyond the pulp tradition even though the formulas and the all the intentions

16:55.500 --> 17:01.180
of the story I think are the same as the early pulp magazines. But Van Vogt is able to go beyond that.

17:13.920 --> 17:19.740
For our second consideration we turn to a novel by Paul Anderson written in 1970.

17:20.380 --> 17:25.580
Tau Zero is a special kind of a science fiction book. There's not very many just like it.

17:27.300 --> 17:31.540
That's only one category that Anderson writes with is the kind of book that Tau Zero is.

17:31.760 --> 17:37.340
He writes almost anything. He writes pure fantasy. He'll write so-called soft or social science fiction.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.640
But there's nobody better at writing hard science fiction than Paul Anderson. I think Tau Zero is

17:43.180 --> 17:47.840
perhaps his best example in that particular form because there's a great deal of science in the

17:47.840 --> 17:52.220
book and some readers might even think that it's a little obtrusive if they don't understand some

17:52.220 --> 17:58.580
of the concepts of relativity and the Bussard ramjet for instance. The science in the novel

17:58.580 --> 18:05.500
actually makes it extremely realistic. It's one of the more believable of the pure space

18:05.500 --> 18:15.280
epics that's ever been written. The story is essentially that of a colony ship. A ship full

18:15.280 --> 18:21.000
of people I think about 50 people who are traveling to a colony at a nearby star to set up and start

18:21.000 --> 18:29.960
life there. And on the way after they've gone part of the way toward the star the ship runs into a

18:29.960 --> 18:39.260
small nebula of gas which causes the ship to lose its power of deceleration. They cannot decelerate

18:39.260 --> 18:46.740
without causing so much radiation harm that they would they would all be killed. The only way that

18:46.740 --> 18:55.380
they can hope to exist is to keep on accelerating until they can get to a place that is relatively

18:55.380 --> 19:00.320
free of gas where they can go outside the ship outside of the protective barriers

19:01.080 --> 19:10.580
and shielding of the ship to repair that deceleration device. The story that develops is that the ship

19:10.580 --> 19:17.560
cannot find a place that is free enough of gas that they can go out and repair the ship

19:17.560 --> 19:25.840
and it keeps on accelerating until it's actually going through galaxies. But no matter how fast

19:25.840 --> 19:31.360
they go they can never go beyond the speed of light because Anderson as we said before is extremely

19:33.000 --> 19:37.140
true to the scientific knowledge of our day and according to the knowledge that we have

19:37.140 --> 19:42.820
faster than light travel is impossible so he has to dream up a method whereby the

19:43.460 --> 19:48.400
this exploration trip can go fast enough to get somewhere and he's devised or he's used

19:48.980 --> 19:55.680
a ship called the Bussard Ramjet to do this. The Bussard Ramjet is not a new idea that was

19:55.680 --> 20:04.240
invented somewhere in the middle of this century. The basic format is that the ship picks up interstellar

20:04.240 --> 20:12.300
gas molecules by the use of a huge electromagnetic web of sorts a force field if you will that

20:12.960 --> 20:18.620
scoops up these interstellar particles and shoots them out the back end. This provides

20:18.620 --> 20:26.400
reaction mass which drives the ship forward. The point is that the faster the ship goes the more

20:26.400 --> 20:33.900
gas molecules it supposedly will contact and shoot out the back end there by increasing

20:33.900 --> 20:42.740
its speed more and more and more on a vicious cycle. The ship would be extremely radioactive

20:43.700 --> 20:49.580
to the point where there would be needed extreme shielding for any human beings to

20:50.100 --> 20:57.520
to be able to ride the thing. I believe in the works of Larry Niven he had the same kind of a

20:57.520 --> 21:02.720
ship that was not habitable and he had robots that used this ship and everybody else had to come

21:02.720 --> 21:09.640
along on the slow boats. Here however Paul Anderson has had this ship big enough and sealed well

21:09.640 --> 21:16.240
enough that humans can ride it. The trouble is when they hit that gas cloud that it not only

21:16.240 --> 21:22.080
destroyed their deceleration method it also sped them up quite a bit to the point where they were

21:22.080 --> 21:27.780
already past where they would have had to stop and turn around and slow down to get to their

21:28.460 --> 21:33.560
original destination. The speed of the ship is one of the basic problems the crew must overcome.

21:34.040 --> 21:39.200
The great speed brings the theory of relativity into play. One of the basic concepts of the

21:39.200 --> 21:44.360
theory of relativity is that the speed that time passes is relative to the speed that an object

21:44.360 --> 21:50.560
is moving. If you have two ships traveling through space with ship A traveling faster than ship B

21:51.160 --> 21:57.420
time will be moving slower on ship A than on ship B. In other words the faster a ship moves the

21:57.420 --> 22:02.560
slower time passes on that ship relative to other slower moving objects surrounding it.

22:03.460 --> 22:08.160
Everything appears normal on the ship to the crew and time seems to be passing faster on objects

22:08.160 --> 22:14.700
traveling slower than the ship. As hours and days pass on the ship months and years pass on earth

22:14.700 --> 22:19.360
and the faster they travel the greater this time difference becomes eventually the crew while

22:19.360 --> 22:26.880
traveling between galaxies watches the universe collapse into a huge mass. This ties in the

22:26.880 --> 22:35.640
current currently accepted theories of the origin of the universe by most of the scientific world.

22:36.440 --> 22:45.320
The Big Bang theory of course in which the universe began as one monomass of energy that

22:45.320 --> 22:51.940
explodes outward. There are two currently popular views of this. One is that the universe would

22:52.680 --> 22:58.180
then continue to expand until it eventually burnt itself out and that would be all a one time only

22:58.180 --> 23:06.580
affair or that the universe would again withdraw by gravitational force back into a monomass and

23:06.580 --> 23:14.280
explode again thus doing it numerous times limitless times. This is the cyclic theory and this is what

23:14.280 --> 23:25.040
Paul Anderson portrays in Tao Zero. The people on board the ship goes so fast that the universe dies

23:25.040 --> 23:32.620
around them. The time has passed exterior to the ship in great quantities of course earth and all

23:32.620 --> 23:38.980
of its peoples and assumably humankind is long gone and they are the only ones left and they're

23:39.920 --> 23:46.940
waiting out the result of this withdrawal of the universe back into a monomass to see what happens

23:46.940 --> 23:52.160
hopefully for them it will explode again. It's one of the things that Anderson tries to bring

23:52.160 --> 23:57.140
across is the incredible amount of time that has passed while they've been on this incredibly fast

23:57.140 --> 24:02.360
flight across the universe. Millions and billions of years have passed as the universe contracts

24:02.360 --> 24:07.800
back down into one large monomass before it explodes back out and creates new galaxies,

24:08.040 --> 24:14.460
new solar systems and at the end of the novel they eventually land on one. They're able to slow down

24:14.460 --> 24:21.140
and they land on one and begin to colonize. And presumably then they will carry on the human race

24:21.140 --> 24:27.320
simply from the 50 members on this ship that have survived into a new universe. To me that's one

24:27.320 --> 24:32.620
of the most fascinating of all exploration, journeys of exploration is to see the death

24:32.620 --> 24:37.400
of a universe in the beginning of another one. That's fascinating the way Anderson treats that

24:37.400 --> 24:45.600
material. It's ultimately very optimistic. I think it's the essence of the exploration theme,

24:45.600 --> 24:51.460
you know to strive, to seek, to never give up. And particularly with two characters on the book,

24:51.560 --> 24:56.960
I think we see Anderson attempting to show two sides of human nature that allow it to persist

24:56.960 --> 25:05.120
and to survive. You have a woman, Ingrid Lindgren, who is second in command on the ship. She epitomizes

25:05.120 --> 25:12.080
feeling, emotion, love, compassion. We have Charles Raymont, who is the, I guess you'd call him the

25:12.080 --> 25:17.340
policeman, the only military man on board who is there to keep order. He is pure practicality,

25:17.460 --> 25:22.460
pure survival. He'll do anything to survive. He's very an emotional, very practical man.

25:23.560 --> 25:30.240
Together those two are able to keep the crew intact. They're able to give it hope. And they are the

25:30.240 --> 25:37.160
ones who are able to well allow the crew to survive into this new universe where you know where

25:37.160 --> 25:41.360
humanity will keep going. The voyage of the space beagle and tau zero I think we would call

25:41.360 --> 25:46.860
two of the more classic treatments of the space exploration theme. But there are many

25:46.860 --> 25:51.840
and ingenious methods, many varied ways that authors have come up with to illustrate that

25:51.840 --> 25:59.680
particular theme. Always I think showing the desire of the human spirit to escape any kind of restraint.

26:25.640 --> 26:31.860
One early example I think of and probably still one of the more popular ones is the idea that

26:31.860 --> 26:37.560
Heinlein illustrated in Orphans of the Sky published from two earlier short stories in 1941.

26:37.560 --> 26:44.960
He uses the device of a generation ship which is an artificial world, complete and self-sufficient,

26:45.960 --> 26:51.100
constructed and inhabited by human beings, which is sent slowly toward the stars.

26:52.200 --> 26:56.400
The original members won't live to arrive of course, but their descendants will. Many generations

26:56.400 --> 27:03.140
removed. And that is one method of space exploration although one which is a little discouraging I

27:03.140 --> 27:08.260
guess to the original crew. In the film Dark Star the protagonists are traveling throughout our

27:08.260 --> 27:14.380
galaxy discovering new solar systems which have habitable planets on them and destroying all

27:14.380 --> 27:19.740
the unstable planets in that system in order to make the system safe for colonization. And one of

27:19.740 --> 27:26.160
their rather unusual story we might mention is by Larry Niven. It's called Rammer. It was a short

27:26.160 --> 27:32.740
story and then made into a novel, a world out of time. Here a corpus sickle, a person who has had

27:32.740 --> 27:37.660
himself frozen in order that he might be revived later for medical treatment. I think the fellow

27:37.660 --> 27:44.580
had cancer or some such disease. Awakes into a future society where they want him for only one

27:44.580 --> 27:50.040
purpose or they don't want him at all and that's to pilot a starship. The fellow is amazed but he

27:50.040 --> 27:56.400
goes along with it because it's his only hope for life. Takes the starship and escapes away from

27:56.400 --> 28:02.920
the society that has programmed him to do their seeding of planets that they want him to do and

28:02.920 --> 28:07.840
goes out on his own to explore the galaxy or whatever he finds that meets his interest.

28:21.620 --> 28:28.240
Space exploration is the cornerstone of postulative fiction for the earth is well known and has become

28:28.240 --> 28:34.520
a very small place in a very big universe. If man is to leave the earth as he has already begun to do

28:34.520 --> 28:40.340
he will have to explore whether it's for the sake of exploring or for practical reasons of

28:40.340 --> 28:46.140
colonization and exploitation or both. Although there are science fiction stories that do not deal

28:46.140 --> 28:51.900
in off earth settings the majority by far are based on the assumption of space travel and exploration

28:51.900 --> 28:57.780
as we try to imagine what could lie ahead for humanity in the worlds of tomorrow.

29:04.920 --> 29:12.060
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane and David Carson. This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

29:12.460 --> 29:18.560
a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association in conjunction with KOCVFM

29:18.560 --> 29:20.740
and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
