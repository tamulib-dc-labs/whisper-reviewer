00:01.180 --> 00:02.380
Okay, the tape is going.

00:03.620 --> 00:08.400
First all I wanted to know was how you first got involved with the fantasy field.

00:08.460 --> 00:12.160
Did you read it as a girl and adolescent and grew up with it or how did you get involved

00:12.160 --> 00:12.540
with it?

00:13.060 --> 00:14.140
Well, not really.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.880
I started reading it in my early 20s.

00:17.020 --> 00:20.020
I had read science fiction when I was younger.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.660
But I discovered fantasy when I was about 23 or 24.

00:24.660 --> 00:28.620
I connected with it more strongly than I had with science fiction.

00:30.800 --> 00:38.960
I've been interested in fantasy almost exclusively since as far as genera fiction is concerned.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.460
I don't read any science fiction anymore.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.640
Okay, in other words, you just didn't grow up reading the pulp, some magazines then?

00:48.680 --> 00:51.220
No, I never liked the pulp particularly.

00:51.220 --> 00:55.640
I liked fairy tales when I was quite little.

00:55.980 --> 01:02.320
Somehow I never thought of them as being suitable for me as a teenage reader or as an adult reader.

01:02.820 --> 01:08.720
It took me a long time to connect and see that fantasy was really suited for adults as well.

01:09.340 --> 01:12.240
I think a lot of people feel that way about fantasy.

01:12.380 --> 01:20.160
They start reading science fiction, perhaps partly because it seems more adult than fantasy.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.220
I don't think that's at all true.

01:23.720 --> 01:30.800
Fantasy is a stronger symbolic meaning where science fiction in a lot of ways is a lot more simplistic.

01:31.460 --> 01:43.040
It's worldviews, feeling around for symbols that don't have an ancient heritage or an ancient long existence in our subconscious, in our culture.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.780
Okay, what about the writing part of it? How did you get involved in that?

01:51.640 --> 01:56.160
Well, I started writing science fiction as well when I was about 13.

01:56.780 --> 02:05.560
I got my first little rejection letter, a pleasant little letter from John Campbell telling me I misspelled one of the words in my title with a one word title.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.580
I was so embarrassed that I never submitted anything else.

02:10.500 --> 02:15.940
Again, it was many years before I ceased to write science fiction stories for the writing of fantasy instead.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.860
Although I'd also written horror stories simultaneously and some of those actually have turned out to be publishable.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.320
One that I wrote when I was a teenager.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.700
The science fiction called garbage that I wrote when I was a teenager.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.520
My major writing is, I think, all been fantasy.

02:34.840 --> 02:42.440
Yeah, I have to confess that I haven't been able to find much background on your, except for the works you published on much else.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.560
Have you published any science fiction at all?

02:45.160 --> 02:54.600
No, everything I've published has been fantasy and with a good deal of horror stories thrown in, it could be considered dark fantasy.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.400
Now, you have some involvement with a fanzine, don't you?

03:01.080 --> 03:08.380
No, I don't. I used to publish a fanzine about feminist fantasy and science fiction.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.880
But I haven't done that for a long time. There's been no time for things like that.

03:14.380 --> 03:22.340
And I did a little newsletter about women warriors to this kind of an interest of mine, but I haven't had time to do that lately either.

03:23.140 --> 03:25.020
Because I have to make a living from my writing.

03:26.540 --> 03:32.600
What? Okay, what was that reference I saw? I think it was in Amazon's 2 to fantasy and terror.

03:33.680 --> 03:40.340
Oh, that was something. That's probably how I entered the professional field, although that wasn't a professional magazine.

03:40.420 --> 03:46.700
I think it was a nice magazine. It was not... I started publishing it, not really knowing what fandom was.

03:46.700 --> 03:53.600
I was involved with literary magazines and university, little magazine.

03:54.260 --> 04:00.460
And I thought it would be real interesting to do something like that. That was all fantasy stories and horror stories.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.920
I found some people that wrote through sorts of things and I started doing this magazine.

04:06.580 --> 04:12.100
And like after I got one issue out, I started getting magazines just like it from hundred other editors.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.400
I was really surprised to find out it wasn't her original idea at all that they were usually called fancy.

04:18.100 --> 04:24.220
I did that until about 1972 to 1975. I did seven issues.

04:27.600 --> 04:38.760
And before I quit doing it, I think it had developed into a rather pleasant magazine as professional as you can be without having any real distribution or backing.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.060
But I got tired of doing it.

04:43.060 --> 04:49.520
Okay, what about another one I saw a reference to? I'm not sure what this is. Wind Haven.

04:50.100 --> 04:57.800
That was the feminist fantasy and science fiction magazine that I started doing after I got tired of doing fantasy and terror.

04:59.880 --> 05:04.220
I guess I was just really interested in small press projects.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.920
I'm not quite sure why, but I still write for some small presses.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.620
I like the energy that small press publishers have.

05:13.880 --> 05:18.860
But of course it doesn't, it can't break even on it. You can't make money on it.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.660
It usually costs more money.

05:22.120 --> 05:26.440
You can only do it for as long as you feel this personal involvement.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.840
And after a while you just get overwhelmed and tired and you stop doing it.

05:30.580 --> 05:36.560
But that did give me some background for when I contracted my first professional anthropology.

05:37.020 --> 05:45.840
The publisher was already aware of who I was and what I was capable of doing, which was a surprise to me because I'd never sent some copies of my magazine.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.220
He knew all about them and thought they were good magazines.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.120
So I gave me a professional contract.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.800
My first break into actually making a living as a writer and editor.

05:57.580 --> 06:00.100
And that's what you're doing now? You can make your living at it?

06:00.240 --> 06:04.900
Yep. One of the small percentage doesn't have to do anything else.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.400
Okay, that must be great. Listen, let me go on for just a little bit to some...

06:10.400 --> 06:16.760
Well, right before I get to some of your work, reading the little head pieces you had in Amazons too, to some of those stories.

06:16.760 --> 06:26.180
There was one that intrigued me. You said that many modern authors are weak and lazy in their research for heroic fantasy.

06:26.800 --> 06:35.000
I got the impression you were implying that a heroic fantasy should be somehow based upon a, I don't know, familiar environment.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.520
Say an ancient Anglo-Saxon made evil kind of background. Is that what you meant?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.700
No, that's really not what I meant at all.

06:40.700 --> 06:47.140
I think most heroic fantasy is based on something really familiar and really Anglo-Saxon and European.

06:48.140 --> 06:52.940
But they don't even... The writers of this sort of fiction don't even research that.

06:53.360 --> 07:01.700
They just take a very superficial meaning from what we all have in our consciousness about what it must have been like.

07:02.080 --> 07:08.540
And they try to invent from there. And what they end up inventing is something that is tremendously superficial.

07:08.540 --> 07:17.340
Almost comic book-like rather than literary. Whereas if they were to do a lot of reading in historical writing,

07:18.840 --> 07:33.660
they would find out that the ancient world was a lot more complex and a lot more interesting than their very fissile fantasies about some Anglo-Europe that they never researched.

07:34.740 --> 07:39.520
I kind of would like to see more fantasy stories that weren't Anglo at all.

07:40.200 --> 07:48.080
And much of my major work is set in a vaguely Asian world.

07:49.060 --> 07:56.380
But it wouldn't even have to be that. Something that was truly complex and different from our own world would be very interesting.

07:56.940 --> 08:02.260
But it usually, no matter how people try, they come up with things that sound Anglo-Europe.

08:03.080 --> 08:12.360
And I think they're essential laziness. They write fantasies because they think they can make everything up without having to read anything else first.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.960
So they end up writing silly things.

08:16.920 --> 08:23.220
You wouldn't be saying now that it wouldn't be possible to write heroic fantasy which has no kind of roots whatsoever.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.480
I think it would be very possible. I can't think of an example or it's been done.

08:30.600 --> 08:35.040
Okay. I think I'm saying this right now. Tomoe goes in.

08:35.500 --> 08:35.940
That's right.

08:36.360 --> 08:46.440
Okay. I have to confess I know nothing about Japanese history or legend, but I assume that it is based on actual history and legend. Would that be correct?

08:46.440 --> 08:53.460
That's pretty correct. The world that Tomoe lives in is called Nipon.

08:53.900 --> 09:01.180
And it's very strongly based on Japanese myth and Japanese history.

09:01.800 --> 09:08.000
But if anybody reads it thinking they'll learn a lot about Japanese myth and history, they'll be wrong.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.360
Because it's a Nipon. It's its own world.

09:12.060 --> 09:18.740
And a lot of that stuff is not very loosely based. Some of it is very rigidly based.

09:18.980 --> 09:22.820
It's a heavy mixture of invention and actual belief.

09:24.300 --> 09:29.440
Well, for instance, when I finished the two books that you've written so far, I was kind of proud of myself and then I said,

09:29.440 --> 09:35.720
gosh, I know something about Japanese legend and history now. I said, if that's what Samurais are like, I like them.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.820
For instance, would my impression of the Samurais be wrong? Is that pretty close to what they were?

09:42.100 --> 09:48.800
Well, I think there is the general feel of the world created in those two books.

09:50.100 --> 09:56.740
It is as near as I can figure out as an amateur historian reads about it incessantly,

09:57.040 --> 10:03.820
that that is pretty much what their behavior patterns were and their thinking patterns and their society in general.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.980
Samurai were like that, sure.

10:09.280 --> 10:17.240
But what I was thinking in terms, I have come across some people who believe that they now know all about Japanese mythology

10:17.240 --> 10:19.860
because of the way it was portrayed in that book.

10:20.320 --> 10:25.080
But I changed some things to suit the world that I was creating.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.900
Anybody that wants to know about Japanese history really should read history books

10:31.780 --> 10:36.760
and people that want to be entertained by fantasy based on that should read my books.

10:37.340 --> 10:38.320
A few other books like that.

10:39.940 --> 10:44.960
Okay, what about some of those monsters like the Tengu or the Bakumonos or whatever they would call them?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.220
Is there any basis for those?

10:46.860 --> 10:54.600
The Tengu and the Bakumonos and also the Kappa, the Empire, those are all real.

10:54.980 --> 10:59.020
They are taken from mythology, some of the most off the wall aspects of them.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.580
Like just a second, somebody at the door.

11:03.200 --> 11:03.440
Okay.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.140
Go away.

11:04.440 --> 11:04.940
That's no trouble.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.680
Okay, I sent them away.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.200
Okay, if you're sure it's okay.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.240
Again, if you weren't expecting me, I feel kind of bad about this.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.520
I didn't want to interrupt you.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.040
I told them to drop by in half an hour.

11:30.460 --> 11:30.740
Okay.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.540
Okay, anyway, I forget what I was saying.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.420
You were just finishing up the answer about the Bakumonos and the Tengu.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.380
They were based.

11:39.820 --> 11:40.980
They're definitely based.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.740
I was thinking of the Kappa, which people find difficult to believe.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.000
I wasn't putting them on.

11:47.500 --> 11:53.460
Like a blood-sucking animal that can be placated with pickles and cucumbers.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.900
They think that's a joke, but that's something that Japanese really used to believe.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.440
I suppose in some outlying areas, they still believe it.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.320
So, both particular types of creatures are real.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.520
There are some other creatures in that series that aren't real.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.160
Okay, did you have any particular impetus or inspiration behind those volumes?

12:17.260 --> 12:17.880
Behind which?

12:18.320 --> 12:21.940
Those volumes, the two and the Tomoi Gozen series.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.860
Hard to say.

12:25.160 --> 12:31.380
I suppose part of it was just my feeling that most of the heroic fantasy written had been pretty similar,

12:31.700 --> 12:34.240
no matter how Barry Biotis tried to be.

12:34.240 --> 12:39.240
They were writing the same thing, which were superficially Anglo-European,

12:39.800 --> 12:44.820
either Viking or Camelot or something like that.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.580
Really predictable or Conan.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.180
So, I wanted to do something different.

12:50.980 --> 13:00.080
I'm not quite sure why I chose it to be something based loosely on Japanese ancient history and myth.

13:01.240 --> 13:09.300
My stepmother is from Thailand, so I've always had Asian friends and relatives, but they were Japanese.

13:11.060 --> 13:19.360
The only thing I can figure that with my major impetus for really liking the Japanese legends and history would be cinema.

13:20.300 --> 13:25.500
I have really been very fond of samurai films, essentially.

13:26.500 --> 13:33.060
I started starting out like most people with Seven Samurai and other films by Akira Kurosawa.

13:34.720 --> 13:41.340
Being lucky to live in an area that has a very large Asian population,

13:41.780 --> 13:47.580
there are two Japanese cinemas and two Chinese cinemas and two more Chinese cinemas opening soon.

13:47.580 --> 13:55.980
I just have a great access to Asian films, more so than most people do around the United States.

13:57.160 --> 14:02.600
I go to them every weekend, essentially. Always watching them, especially Japanese films.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.340
I lived in San Francisco five years and of course they have a large Chinese community,

14:08.340 --> 14:12.740
and I enjoyed going down there and involving myself in that culture as much as I could.

14:13.880 --> 14:20.240
Listen, about Tomoi, you may not want to answer this because it might get into your third volume,

14:20.500 --> 14:28.960
but to me she was at least a searcher. Even though she achieves almost everything she sets out to achieve,

14:29.060 --> 14:34.820
she's dissatisfied, she keeps looking, she's sort of a maverick, and even marriage and so forth wasn't satisfying to her.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.840
Why is she that way? Are you leading her up towards something?

14:40.460 --> 14:47.960
Well, I don't know if she's exactly a searcher, not someone on any sort of quest.

14:48.740 --> 14:54.420
She's someone that changes though in the course of the three books, the third and the fourth, which isn't finished yet.

14:55.200 --> 15:04.920
In the first book I try to present her as somewhat naive. She's very young and she does essentially what her society expects of her.

15:06.360 --> 15:12.020
Until the very end when she feels somewhat sad that she's actually succeeded,

15:12.220 --> 15:17.360
she succeeded in doing everything the culture expects and has made her particularly happy.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.100
So in the second book she's questioning everything that in the first book she took for granted,

15:25.780 --> 15:31.300
and yet still goes along with it. She continues to do everything the society expects of her.

15:31.300 --> 15:39.560
She's obedient to her Lord with her husband and does everything she can to help him as she's supposed to,

15:39.820 --> 15:42.620
and everything comes to know good end at all.

15:43.520 --> 15:51.600
So in the third book she is definitely outside the society that she was a part of previously.

15:52.140 --> 15:56.440
She's not actively rebellion against it, but no longer participating in it.

15:56.440 --> 16:06.500
She becomes essentially a wandering nun, and history allows me to continue to have her be a swordswoman.

16:07.100 --> 16:12.640
Because there were martial nuns that wandered about Japan, so she can still be an adventurer, a fighter.

16:13.380 --> 16:19.580
She's no longer fighting for the system that in the first book everything was aimed at sporting the system,

16:19.840 --> 16:23.480
and in the third book everything is outside that system.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.500
She never becomes a total rebel though, she never actively seeks to destroy the system.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.440
Okay, I'm an English teacher and I can't help seeing symbolism.

16:37.080 --> 16:43.940
In the first book she starts off as a swordswoman, as a warrior, she starts off with the double swords,

16:44.140 --> 16:46.200
the equal swords, and then changes to the single one.

16:46.200 --> 16:51.240
Did you mean something that she was a divided person, she was incomplete when she had the double swords,

16:51.460 --> 16:53.180
and she had to go to a unified method?

16:53.900 --> 17:00.520
Well, some of that is maybe subconscious to me only, I'm not sure.

17:01.440 --> 17:08.720
I was thinking of, when I did that I was thinking in terms of some martial philosophy that is perhaps mine,

17:08.820 --> 17:10.360
as a martial artist personally.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.980
It's hard to put a handle on that.

17:16.100 --> 17:20.560
I think these books are full of symbolism, some of it conscious and some of it not.

17:21.480 --> 17:27.740
I'm not quite sure that that was a really important element in that symbolism, I'm not sure.

17:29.140 --> 17:39.360
Okay, in the second volume, I wondered why you were so cruel to Azo Hono-O

17:39.360 --> 17:42.060
when you had Tamoi just cut off her arm.

17:42.180 --> 17:47.460
I thought it would have been a lot more satisfactory at least to maybe end her life.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.340
Why cut off an arm of a warrior like that and let her live?

17:51.420 --> 18:01.160
I had hoped it was implied that even with one arm Azo Hono-O might become a very successful woman warrior herself.

18:02.220 --> 18:08.220
Obviously Azo didn't believe that that would happen to her and she felt it was cruel to be left alive.

18:09.020 --> 18:14.860
But it was my intention to imply that she was wrong about that, that she could still become a successful person,

18:15.180 --> 18:18.640
although she had lost that duel and lost one arm.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.600
And that story is actually followed up.

18:22.820 --> 18:27.640
There's an anthology edited by Susan Schwartz called Hikates Caldron.

18:28.300 --> 18:34.600
And I have a short story in there called the Harmonious Battle and it tells what happened to Azo Hono-O after she lost her arm.

18:35.800 --> 18:42.220
And she becomes an extremely successful in a way, kind of ironic way.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.800
So it's not a tragedy that she survived.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.520
Okay, good.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.780
When do you think that... did you say you're writing on the third volume now and if so when would it be out?

18:55.800 --> 18:58.640
It's very difficult to say when it will be out.

18:58.640 --> 19:08.400
Since I haven't finished it, the publisher can't really schedule it for publication until I give the publisher an idea when I'll be finished with it.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.920
It's taking me a lot longer than I expected to write this one.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.140
The second one I wrote relatively, with relatively no problem.

19:17.640 --> 19:22.800
This one for whatever reason is just taking me a lot longer to do.

19:24.900 --> 19:30.500
Okay, why do... why does the subject of... this is probably an awfully general question.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.960
But why does the subject of women as warriors appeal to you so much?

19:35.080 --> 19:47.920
You know, maybe partly because I study the martial arts myself personally and maybe partly because I've in the past been heavily involved with feminism.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.700
Not so much involved with the doubt because I'm too involved with my own writing.

19:53.460 --> 20:04.160
But I think from my first three novels, the two novels about Timoy and a third novel called Swordswoman published by Tor, everybody's got the impression that I only write about swordswoman

20:04.160 --> 20:10.740
when in fact I've just struck on some commercial success with my material about swordswoman.

20:10.740 --> 20:15.960
And my short stories cover a much wider range of material.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.820
And I think my novels in the future will also.

20:20.240 --> 20:32.740
But I suppose I've just been very, very much interested in heroic fantasy and not so much interested in writing about men as about women right now.

20:33.200 --> 20:39.960
Although I hope I'm very fair in my characterization of men and have some interesting male characters in all my work.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.320
Oh yeah, I would agree with that.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.960
As long as you mentioned swordswoman, let me quickly get onto that for a minute.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.780
In a sense, I guess that's the alternate worlds again.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.860
In this case, you have one heroic world and then one civilized, meaning the earth.

20:56.420 --> 21:01.460
Do you have any particular preference when you set up an extreme dichotomy like that?

21:03.660 --> 21:04.880
I'm not quite sure I understand.

21:06.080 --> 21:11.700
Well, do you prefer the heroic world that Erin goes to or the civilized one that she ends up on earth?

21:12.580 --> 21:13.480
Difficult to say.

21:14.260 --> 21:19.200
I personally would not have wanted to live in the world where Erin went.

21:20.400 --> 21:25.480
But for her personally, it's obviously the world where she should have been allowed to stay.

21:25.480 --> 21:32.740
I'm almost required to write another book about her that puts her back there permanently.

21:33.860 --> 21:39.720
I think it's clear from the context of the story that Ends World is the place where she belongs.

21:39.940 --> 21:42.360
That's not a place where I belong. I wouldn't get along there at all.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.500
I thought it was rather an ugly world.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.980
I think our world is perhaps just as ugly.

21:49.980 --> 21:55.600
And perhaps Ends World is really just in many ways symbolic of our own world.

21:56.820 --> 21:59.140
That's why it's ugly and that's why this one's ugly.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.160
I couldn't make a choice between the two worlds.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.280
I don't think Ends World really existed.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.420
I would probably decide to stay in our own.

22:08.740 --> 22:09.840
I'm more familiar with it.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.080
They're both cruel worlds.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.740
Okay, was there a particular impetus behind that book?

22:16.880 --> 22:19.800
Or did you just come upon an idea that seemed interesting to you?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.580
There are many impetuses behind that book.

22:26.140 --> 22:30.080
It's a type of book that is essentially...

22:31.900 --> 22:36.960
Gosh, the basic premise can be found in some of Edgar Rice's Boroughs,

22:38.040 --> 22:42.500
Swordsman of Mars type novels where some man averse is transposed to

22:42.500 --> 22:45.340
this world of adventure and gets along fine and dandy,

22:45.380 --> 22:47.940
saves princesses with green eyes and things like that.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.960
I just thought it was all such a lot of nonsense and really childish.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.020
And I tried to write what would really happen to someone.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.880
If that particular fantasy came true for them,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.580
if they liked this kind of literature,

22:58.580 --> 23:00.640
wished that thing would happen to them,

23:01.280 --> 23:03.180
and it does happen to them.

23:03.180 --> 23:07.280
And they go there and essentially it's just not consistent success at all.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.380
She ends up living like a troll under a bridge,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.360
a bum unable to feed herself or take care of herself.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.900
She just can't cope with this change at all.

23:16.180 --> 23:21.420
It's very slow how she ends up adapting to that world

23:21.420 --> 23:23.060
and learning to love that world.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.380
That was probably my main...

23:26.380 --> 23:31.020
The main thing I wanted to do was to show the absurdity of fantasy

23:31.020 --> 23:34.860
as it usually goes and how it might go instead,

23:35.380 --> 23:36.600
if it was done more logically.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.880
Okay, I did enjoy that novel very much.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.720
There are a lot of things I could ask about it,

23:42.720 --> 23:44.820
but I want to make sure we have time to cover some more things.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.720
So I want to move on for just a few minutes to Amazon's, the Amazon's books.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.020
The first one, Amazon's.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.420
What was the story behind your working on that

23:54.420 --> 23:58.640
and how you became interested in doing that volume and how it was set up?

23:59.600 --> 24:03.180
That, of course, was my first professional work

24:03.180 --> 24:06.900
when I ceased to be an amateur press person.

24:07.460 --> 24:12.440
I'd actually started that project as an amateur press project.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.840
I was going to do an anthology and publish it myself,

24:16.320 --> 24:18.260
of stories about women warriors.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.360
I wrote around to some people, some famous people,

24:22.540 --> 24:24.760
some not so famous people, and asked them if they'd write stories.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.000
They wrote great stories.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.980
They were just excited by the idea.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.960
Up to this point, you wrote fantasy stories.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.340
This is 1978, when I first started doing the project.

24:36.800 --> 24:42.040
There were very, very few you wrote fantasy stories with women as protagonists.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.300
Everybody thought it was just great and wonderful.

24:45.060 --> 24:47.120
I was shocked by the response.

24:47.980 --> 24:51.600
So I contacted a publisher just on the off chance

24:51.600 --> 24:54.600
that they might think it was a wonderful idea too, and they did.

24:55.360 --> 25:00.020
It turned out to be a professional anthology rather than a small press anthology.

25:00.740 --> 25:04.060
Then it went on to win the World Fantasy Award.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.920
I guess that's when I started to be able to make my living as an editor and a writer.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.140
Everybody started paying attention to my work.

25:13.340 --> 25:17.220
I guess the response of readers must have been pretty good to that work too, right?

25:18.500 --> 25:19.760
I kind of cheated.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.780
I put my address on the last page of the book.

25:23.780 --> 25:29.820
That caused me to get hundreds and hundreds of letters for while I was getting 20 letters a day.

25:30.440 --> 25:35.720
Mostly from women, but also from a lot of guys who were just really tickled to read all these stories.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.900
That was a wide range of people.

25:38.380 --> 25:44.500
There were super right wing people, or super left wing people.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.860
Just people that just liked stories.

25:47.420 --> 25:52.040
Everybody didn't matter what their personal politics or persuasion.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.000
They just really liked those stories.

25:54.580 --> 25:57.240
I suppose that means it's fairly successful.

25:58.220 --> 26:02.980
Although sometimes I wonder if being that A political is a good thing.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.540
There were a few people that hated it because they could tell I was feminist,

26:07.740 --> 26:13.380
and they thought that destroyed the worth of the apology for me to have a feminist perspective personally.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.580
But mostly everybody liked it.

26:15.580 --> 26:16.680
I certainly did.

26:16.940 --> 26:20.320
I've never gotten more letters for anything else I've ever done.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.040
And of course that kind of response must have led into the Amazon's too then.

26:26.160 --> 26:26.540
Yes.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.900
Many of the letters weren't sent to my address.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.960
They were sent to the publisher who forwarded them to me.

26:33.040 --> 26:37.220
So the publisher also got to see how many people were interested.

26:37.980 --> 26:44.980
But really the publisher didn't decide that there could be a second volume until it won the World Fantasy Award.

26:44.980 --> 26:48.260
And then he instantly was interested in a second volume.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.400
Gosh, I guess I didn't realize that words did so that much for a book.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.980
I thought if a book is good it would sell without an award on it.

26:58.460 --> 27:04.920
Well, it's very difficult with the anthology especially because they never sell as well as novels.

27:05.120 --> 27:10.500
The best selling anthology doesn't sell nearly as well as a pretty good selling novel.

27:11.260 --> 27:16.160
So a publisher, some publishers therefore won't publish anthologies.

27:16.380 --> 27:20.040
There are many publishers that won't publish anthologies because they know a novel will do better.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.760
Others feel a commitment to the short story and to the anthology.

27:25.460 --> 27:30.260
And if they make all their money back a little bit of profit they have to be satisfied.

27:31.020 --> 27:34.400
Then they're not going to have any meaningful profits from anthology.

27:34.400 --> 27:41.460
They tend to make their decisions on unrelated reasons not so related to the commercial aspect.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.440
The commercial aspect is their first consideration.

27:44.700 --> 27:48.420
If an anthology loses money there certainly won't be a second one like it.

27:48.740 --> 27:54.060
If it makes little money then they have to have some additional reason for doing a second one like it.

27:54.420 --> 27:55.940
In this case it wasn't an award.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.660
Okay, I'd like to move on to one more area to make sure we have time to cover this.

28:01.660 --> 28:05.760
I teach a science fiction fantasy course here at Obesa College.

28:06.620 --> 28:10.420
It's going to be total fantasy next semester and we're going to read a lot of heroic fantasy.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.160
I'm going to have the students read quite a bit of it.

28:12.700 --> 28:16.080
I'm probably going to use your Tamoy Gozen novel, the first one.

28:16.980 --> 28:19.500
I kind of like to get some of your ideas just about fantasy in general.

28:19.680 --> 28:24.500
I want to ask you why do people read heroic fantasy and why has it been so popular recently?

28:26.620 --> 28:29.800
Well, I don't think you can generalize why people like it.

28:32.260 --> 28:40.660
I think for some people it has a very deep symbolic meaning in their personal daily lives.

28:40.920 --> 28:47.960
Obviously nobody is really a big, tough swords master who can win their way through any problem.

28:49.020 --> 28:57.120
But I think that there is a relationship between these fantasies and the real world that's not just escapists

28:57.120 --> 29:04.820
in that our daily lives are pretty dangerous and we somehow manage to survive and go to the end of our lives anyway.

29:05.340 --> 29:14.080
There is a kind of, I suppose, burlesque and extreme, but the heroic fantasy world is very much like our own world

29:14.080 --> 29:17.800
and the dangers we manage to survive day after day.

29:18.460 --> 29:25.960
Also, the amount of death and the blood gore that exists in these kinds of novels is to many people exploitative

29:25.960 --> 29:31.340
and grotesque. They don't like it. They don't know why so many other people do like it.

29:31.620 --> 29:36.700
And they think very badly of that form of literature because it is so bloody.

29:38.180 --> 29:43.680
But to me, I think there is definitely that exploit to that aspect of it.

29:43.700 --> 29:49.580
But I think it's also, again, symbolic of the transience of our own life.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.920
At any moment you could get smashed to smithereens in a car crash.

29:52.920 --> 30:00.440
Life can just end suddenly. Even if you live a long life, I mean, 80 years or 60 years, this is not a long time.

30:01.380 --> 30:08.420
And the sudden death and the danger that these worlds represent is very much like our own world.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.860
They are very honest in a way.

30:13.420 --> 30:19.500
So there are people at both extremes. There are people who like it just because it's bloody and gory and ugly.

30:19.500 --> 30:24.320
And they really like that. They really like death and slaughter and all that grotesque stuff.

30:24.480 --> 30:30.680
There are other people that approach it from a feeling that it is symbolic of the transience of our own life.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.780
I've talked to some science fiction authors recently. I guess the last one was Charles Sheffield.

30:36.980 --> 30:44.840
He was talking about fantasy. And he said he thought that one of the reasons it's so popular right now is that we're having sort of hard times around the world,

30:44.840 --> 30:49.020
not just the United States. You have the economy, the wars and so forth. And the people just want to escape.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.960
And maybe he thought that might have been one reason it's so popular.

30:52.680 --> 31:00.140
Yeah, well, Sheffield, of course, is a science fiction writer. And science fiction writers in general don't like fantasy in general.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.160
And they dislike especially that it's selling very well right now.

31:04.780 --> 31:11.740
So I mean, it would be like, that would be like me saying the reason science fiction is popular is because people don't like people anymore.

31:11.740 --> 31:18.940
They only like machines. They only like computers and war games and other sorts of things that they can plug into.

31:19.500 --> 31:24.920
And I think that's very biased to me to say that. People like science fiction like it because they do.

31:25.700 --> 31:31.180
And to me, science fiction is entirely escapist and ridiculous. And fantasy is a lot of fun.

31:31.820 --> 31:40.360
To Sheffield, it's the other way around. I don't think that any particular form of literature, when I think of it logically,

31:41.040 --> 31:46.580
fantasy is not more escapist than something else. Science fiction is not more escapist than something else.

31:46.940 --> 31:50.220
Some people must read it so that they can forget that the world exists.

31:51.180 --> 31:56.240
But I think most people when they read it, they're seeing things and learning things about the world that does exist.

31:58.200 --> 32:04.320
Okay, very good. Do you think that either form fantasy or science fiction is easier to write?

32:05.380 --> 32:15.020
No, I don't think either one is easier to write. I think the majority of science fiction is not very good and was easy to write.

32:15.280 --> 32:24.120
And the majority of fantasy is not very good and was easy to write. But anything that's done well, I don't think it ever comes really quite as easily.

32:25.040 --> 32:32.440
Some people may think it's very difficult to write a good story because it's too much of your personal self that goes into it,

32:32.580 --> 32:38.320
too much personal soul searching and too much technique and just sweaty work.

32:41.240 --> 32:46.080
Yeah, I imagine it takes quite a long time to write a novel, especially like the Tomoy Gozane ones.

32:48.420 --> 32:51.640
You mentioned this just a minute ago. You might answer it just quickly again for me.

32:51.660 --> 32:58.600
You made a statement in the Amazons too that good fantasy, I think something of this effect, that there was an element of grimness about it should be grim.

32:59.660 --> 33:02.720
Does that relate to your previous answer that it tells us something about the real world?

33:04.580 --> 33:08.400
Gosh, I guess I don't really believe that fantasy needs to be grim.

33:09.110 --> 33:22.500
I think the stuff that I've read that strikes me as the most intensely rewarding and the most beautiful is at once ironically humorous and very dark nature.

33:23.380 --> 33:36.620
And I think most of the classic epic poems and things, the moments in them when you're really overwhelmed, that's when everything is almost at the same time amusing and incredibly sad.

33:36.620 --> 33:47.500
And that's my personal feeling that the best fantasy has an element of grimness to it, an element of ironic evil.

33:49.720 --> 33:54.940
But I'm sure there's some light little fairy stories that have nothing but sweetness to them that are also good literature.

33:57.140 --> 34:05.380
You said you started out with fairy tales years ago. I guess you would maintain there's an obvious relationship between fantasy and fairy folk tales or folklore, isn't there?

34:07.100 --> 34:13.140
In most cases, I think that one is the direct outgrowth of the other.

34:15.280 --> 34:27.440
But heroic fantasy probably has its most obvious roots in ancient epics from Gilgamesh or Jason and the Argonauts, anything like that.

34:27.440 --> 34:38.820
It's probably its most obvious roots, but in the nature of storytelling it in prose form. It's more related to fairy tales.

34:44.880 --> 34:53.120
If you had to recommend some fantasy to somebody who'd never read it, or let me do it this way, what are your personal favorites in the field of fantasy?

34:53.260 --> 34:55.840
Do you have any books that you especially think are extremely good?

34:57.080 --> 35:05.880
It's always hard to say that, of course. I'm not really well read in the field, I must say, first because I spend most of my reading time reading nonfiction.

35:06.960 --> 35:12.960
But of what I have read, there are some things that I think are tremendous that are new.

35:13.260 --> 35:21.920
One of the most tremendous books that I've seen recently is a book called Death's Master by Tannin Lee.

35:24.640 --> 35:30.400
I just think that's an awfully good book. It's almost too good to be written in the current decade.

35:32.680 --> 35:37.700
I think the work of Phyllis Ann Carr, who's another writer, is fairly good.

35:38.460 --> 35:41.560
Perhaps I think that only because it's fairly similar to my own.

35:42.880 --> 35:51.720
I, of course, think that what I do is fairly good. I can't really think of anything else I would overtly recommend.

35:53.920 --> 36:00.480
Usually when people ask me what they should read, if they've never read any fantasy, I usually tell them to read history books instead.

36:01.580 --> 36:11.540
There's just a lot more happening in a history book. There's a lot more interesting characters in the entries, and you'd find that even the best fantasy is a lot more interesting than the other.

36:12.460 --> 36:19.100
So you have to like fantasy to read it rather than read it because it's going to be inherently good.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.680
There are very few things that are inherently good.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.660
Do you think there have been any movies that have done a decent job with fantasy?

36:29.480 --> 36:36.740
Well, I am obviously a cinema fan. I write criticism of films for publication.

36:38.260 --> 36:49.400
I think there are some films that I've enjoyed an awful lot. I don't think there are any good ones if you were going to base them on the same level that you would base a work of literature.

36:51.260 --> 36:59.840
Most recently, there is a really badly acted movie. It's so badly acted. It's called Beastmaster.

37:00.520 --> 37:14.520
It's just really badly acted, and yet it's the first one I felt like almost captured the spirit of heroic fantasy in that it was not fatal, masochistic, and it was not grotesque.

37:14.960 --> 37:20.120
It was very adventurous. It was a very pleasant movie. I enjoyed it.

37:20.120 --> 37:36.360
It certainly is no classic. Most of the stuff that's been done recently, like Conan the Barbarian, is just awful. It's spiritually awful. It's bad as cinema. It's bad as heroic fantasy. It's just bad.

37:36.360 --> 37:54.860
It represents what is the worst and least appealing about the heroic fantasy genre. I'm really sad to see that being picked out from the genre and being fed to the masses as what heroic fantasy is about.

37:56.180 --> 37:57.820
Did you see Dragon Slayer?

37:58.480 --> 38:16.640
Yes, I did. I didn't think much of it in the movie. It had a lot higher technical value than most of the other heroic fantasy films. It was a well-made film visually. It didn't look like a bunch of amateurs threw it together.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.160
I think it was very effective. It was too full of cliche.

38:24.760 --> 38:35.980
You mentioned this earlier in some of your answers, but could you summarize it for me? The kind of work you have planned for your future, like what you're writing now, what kind of plans you might have for things that you're going to publish?

38:36.960 --> 39:01.300
Well, of course I have to finish off the saga the more I go then. But when I'm finished with that book, I'm also working on a book that I hope to finish almost simultaneously that remains to be seen, which is set in Southeast Asia, kind of set in a mythological Cambodia or Compecia, whatever it's called now.

39:02.860 --> 39:22.100
It's essentially an ancient love story full of magic, has very little in the way of violence. Quite the opposite about people who come to expect me to write. It's hard to say what all right after that. There's always more things in mind than anybody can conceivably do in a lifetime.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.340
What about another anthology?

39:53.800 --> 40:08.920
It's a wider range of heroic fantasy. Some very experimental material in there, which heroic fantasy has not been well known for experimental literature, but I think this time there will be some of that.

40:09.440 --> 40:25.420
And if it's a successful anthology, it will become an annual. If it's not commercially successful, then of course it'll be the only one. I have no other anthology projects in mind right now because I have so much to finish in terms of novels.

40:28.140 --> 40:43.940
Yeah, listen, this is probably, I'm probably using up too much of your time. Imagine your guest is going to be back pretty soon. Is there anything else? I guess we've got enough material for about a probably a week's worth. The show is only five minutes per day. It's on every day for five minutes.

40:43.940 --> 40:53.580
So we sort of chop an interview up into a five minute segment. So we've got enough here for a whole week's worth. But is there anything else that you, any area you'd like to talk about briefly before the taper ends out?

40:55.440 --> 41:01.400
I wish I could say something exceedingly wise, but I really can't think of anything on my own right now.

41:02.120 --> 41:29.820
Okay, that's fine. I'm very, I'm very satisfied with what we've got. And listen, as I said, I'm setting up a fantasy class for our spring semester out here. And we might very well teach Tamoy Gozen. If we did that, and we contacted you, would it be possible for you to, sometimes what we do when we teach science fiction or fantasy is have an author, we just call it the author and we have a speaker for an arrangement here. And the students can just ask questions of the author about the book. Would you be amenable to that?

41:29.820 --> 41:31.280
Sure. That would be exciting.

41:32.300 --> 41:47.160
Okay, then we can get in touch with you if that works out. And listen up. We have about, oh, maybe six or eight weeks lag time before these shows get on the air at least. So when we edit them, and when they're done, we will send you copies, obviously.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.960
Okay, that would be nice.

41:49.340 --> 41:54.040
And I appreciate your time very much. And I do admire your work. I hope you keep coming out with it.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.860
Okay. I hope that you've used one of my books. I hope you use the Golden 99.

41:59.820 --> 42:00.520
Instead of Tamoy?

42:00.820 --> 42:00.980
Yeah.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.580
But that would mean they have to read Tamoy first to get the background. Maybe they wouldn't have time to do all that, maybe.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.100
If you feel that's true, I think they will stand alone.

42:12.940 --> 42:16.460
Or to be read backwards. I don't think they're dependent on each other.

42:17.780 --> 42:25.480
You might be right. Okay, we could maybe Xerox that first part though, where you explained about Naipon. That was pretty clear in Tamoy, but it wasn't so clear in Naginata.

42:26.240 --> 42:37.520
I had to fight with my editor to leave it off. My editor wanted to reprint that little introduction. I disagree, but you obviously would have agreed with her.

42:38.420 --> 42:43.240
I'm speaking from a point of view of some uncultured freshman. They may not catch enough of it.

42:44.620 --> 42:54.160
If you use these ideas in my books, I will be extremely flattered. I just happen to be a little more fond of the second one. I think it has fewer clumsy passages.

42:56.060 --> 43:04.780
Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Listen, we thank you very much for your time and we will send you those tapes when they're done, and then perhaps we'd be in touch with you next semester to see if you could talk to the class.

43:05.140 --> 43:06.460
Okay. Thank you very much.

43:06.680 --> 43:07.140
Bye-bye.
