00:00.000 --> 00:37.679
[Music.]

00:37.088 --> 00:38.911
[Tom Turbiville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.931 --> 00:39.912
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.694 --> 00:42.416
[Tom Turbiville]: Join the Navy and see the world.

00:42.717 --> 00:53.954
[Tom Turbiville]: And indeed, Lieutenant Commander Garland Bayliss of College Station saw most of it in his two-year service aboard Auxiliary Personnel 149, a troop transport ship during World War II.

00:54.475 --> 01:01.566
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a vessel built only as a transport and ferried up to 3,000 from one town or island to another.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.210
[Tom Turbiville]: It took some back from war.

01:04.190 --> 01:09.616
[Tom Turbiville]: from home and some from home into that.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.699
[Tom Turbiville]: You know, I messed that up when I was rehearsing it.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.702
[Tom Turbiville]: I wrote it right, I just can't say it.

01:16.704 --> 01:17.265
[Tom Turbiville]: Sorry about that.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.788
[Tom Turbiville]: That happens about three times a year.

01:20.088 --> 01:21.550
[Tom Turbiville]: So congratulations, you were here.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.551
[Garland Bayliss]: I messed you up.

01:22.571 --> 01:23.032
[Tom Turbiville]: No, you didn't.

01:23.232 --> 01:24.473
[Tom Turbiville]: No, no, I messed my up.

01:25.194 --> 01:26.355
[Tom Turbiville]: Let me look at it and see.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.617
[Tom Turbiville]: I know I wrote it right.

01:27.637 --> 01:29.539
[Tom Turbiville]: I just, it's just awkward for me to see.

01:31.898 --> 01:33.881
[Tom Turbiville]: I wrote it the way I meant to read it.

01:33.921 --> 01:37.946
[Tom Turbiville]: It's just that my eyes aren't.

01:37.966 --> 01:43.714
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a vessel built only as a transport and ferried up to 3,000 from one town or island to another.

01:44.214 --> 01:49.161
[Tom Turbiville]: It took some back home from war and some from home into war.

01:49.201 --> 01:50.223
[Tom Turbiville]: That's exactly what I want.

01:50.463 --> 01:51.024
[Tom Turbiville]: It took some.

01:51.364 --> 01:52.606
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, I'm going to read every word.

01:52.626 --> 01:55.269
[Garland Bayliss]: You just got it tangled a little bit there.

01:57.452 --> 01:58.834
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, sorry about that.

02:05.767 --> 02:08.191
[Tom Turbiville]: They need stuff for their Christmas party tape.

02:08.251 --> 02:09.685
[Tom Turbiville]: That's why I did that.

02:46.874 --> 03:12.173
Thank you.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.890
[Tom Turbiville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.911
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm Tom Turbiville.

03:23.552 --> 03:25.195
[Tom Turbiville]: Join the Navy and see the world.

03:25.495 --> 03:36.632
[Tom Turbiville]: And indeed, Lieutenant Commander Garland Bayliss of College Station saw most of it in his two-year service aboard auxiliary personnel 149, a troop transport ship during World War II.

03:37.213 --> 03:44.503
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a vessel built only as a transport and ferried up to 3,000 from one town or island to another.

03:44.524 --> 03:49.551
[Tom Turbiville]: It took some back home from war and some from home into war.

03:49.531 --> 04:14.104
[Tom Turbiville]: it was on the water both in the pacific and atlantic for two years and he traveled some 125 000 nautical miles in all Garland Bayliss spent 30 years in the navy and the reserves and 
then later spent 34 years as a professor of history at texas a m. Please welcome Garland Bayliss to veterans of the valley. Garland it's an honor to to know you i've known you for some time and to have you here on veterans of the valley

04:14.388 --> 04:17.071
[Tom Turbiville]: Finally, let's talk a little bit about growing up.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.993
[Tom Turbiville]: You grew up in McGee, Arkansas.

04:19.013 --> 04:19.674
[Garland Bayliss]: That is correct.

04:19.914 --> 04:20.955
[Tom Turbiville]: Southeast part of the state.

04:21.015 --> 04:22.176
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about growing up in McGee.

04:22.237 --> 04:30.265
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, McGee was a small country town, about 3,000, 18 miles of Mississippi River, 40 miles north of Louisiana.

04:31.026 --> 04:35.491
[Garland Bayliss]: The railroad town is essentially up in a railroad family, also cotton and corn.

04:36.512 --> 04:40.176
[Garland Bayliss]: Rural of the country folks all came to town on Saturday.

04:40.595 --> 04:44.039
[Garland Bayliss]: I won't go into what is called furnish day, you've probably never heard of it.

04:44.059 --> 04:49.565
[Garland Bayliss]: That's when the land owners furnish their tenants with money to make the ensuing crop.

04:50.826 --> 04:58.935
[Garland Bayliss]: Got out of high school there, started college in Monticello, Arkansas, then Arkansas A&M, now the University of Arkansas at Monticello.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.918
[Garland Bayliss]: Very small school, virtually no men left.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.742
[Garland Bayliss]: The 206th Coastal Artillery Battery had been activated.

05:05.722 --> 05:10.613
[Garland Bayliss]: and sent to Alaska, that left a ratio of about four women to every boy, which was pretty good.

05:10.673 --> 05:11.495
[Garland Bayliss]: That wasn't a bad deal.

05:11.555 --> 05:12.236
[Garland Bayliss]: Wasn't a bad deal.

05:12.256 --> 05:13.238
[Tom Turbiville]: I want to go back to your family.

05:13.258 --> 05:15.122
[Tom Turbiville]: Your family was in the railroad business.

05:15.143 --> 05:16.325
[Garland Bayliss]: Your dad was a conductor.

05:16.345 --> 05:18.069
[Garland Bayliss]: That's right, and two brothers were conductors.

05:18.089 --> 05:18.951
[Garland Bayliss]: And two brothers worked.

05:18.971 --> 05:20.895
[Garland Bayliss]: And they were thus exempt from the draft.

05:20.875 --> 05:21.596
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

05:21.616 --> 05:24.258
[Garland Bayliss]: My two other brothers, both drafted.

05:25.139 --> 05:29.243
[Garland Bayliss]: One spent over four years overseas, another three and a half years before they got home.

05:29.263 --> 05:29.583
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.484
[Garland Bayliss]: They were stationed.

05:30.604 --> 05:37.711
[Garland Bayliss]: One went from North Africa, Sicily, to Italy, into France and into Germany before the war was over.

05:37.972 --> 05:38.312
[Garland Bayliss]: Exactly.

05:38.332 --> 05:46.720
[Garland Bayliss]: The other was stationed off the Persian Gulf in Basra, part of the Lend-Lease Program of material from the United States to Russia and reverse.

05:47.101 --> 05:47.541
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

05:47.858 --> 05:54.309
[Tom Turbiville]: You went from Arkansas to, you talked about the programs, a V1 program that eventually became a V12 program.

05:54.790 --> 05:57.355
[Tom Turbiville]: And it had to do with education, how many semesters.

05:57.415 --> 06:01.422
[Tom Turbiville]: And talk about sort of how that worked and eventually how that got you to Columbia University.

06:01.442 --> 06:04.688
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, in November of 42, we all knew we were going to have to do something.

06:05.589 --> 06:08.214
[Garland Bayliss]: 18, we debated in college dorms what to do.

06:08.875 --> 06:12.381
[Garland Bayliss]: I said, I'm going to the Navy and said, Garland, don't, you can't swim very well.

06:12.361 --> 06:14.284
[Garland Bayliss]: I wanted to be in a foxhole in the Army.

06:15.185 --> 06:20.954
[Garland Bayliss]: So I went to Little Rock, Arkansas in November 1942, joined what was called the Navy V-1 program.

06:21.295 --> 06:30.589
[Garland Bayliss]: The theory here, that word theory, was you would stay in that program until you received your degree, and then you go to Officer's Candidate School, or Navy Midshipman.

06:30.569 --> 06:31.591
[Garland Bayliss]: The war progressed.

06:31.611 --> 06:32.513
[Garland Bayliss]: They needed officers.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.379
[Garland Bayliss]: They cut that down through the V1 program.

06:36.101 --> 06:44.158
[Garland Bayliss]: Arkansas and at Monticello was selected as one of those schools.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.565
[Garland Bayliss]: So I put on a uniform along with guys in the Marine Corps.

06:47.647 --> 06:53.255
[Garland Bayliss]: including Tom Chandler, who was in the Marine Corps, though I didn't know Tom then, our former head baseball coach.

06:53.276 --> 06:55.078
[Tom Turbiville]: You didn't know you were together until you got here.

06:55.098 --> 06:56.581
[Garland Bayliss]: Until I got here, that is correct.

06:56.781 --> 06:57.402
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

06:57.422 --> 07:10.041
[Garland Bayliss]: And so after a total of five semesters, got three, got two, whatever, I was sent to Columbia University in New York City to Navy midshipment school for a 90-day program to convert me, hopefully, into a naval officer.

07:10.061 --> 07:14.127
[Tom Turbiville]: Yeah, you talked about how a country boy from McGee, Arkansas, going up to New York City, that was

07:14.512 --> 07:15.333
[Tom Turbiville]: Quite a culture shock.

07:15.513 --> 07:16.033
[Garland Bayliss]: Very much.

07:16.274 --> 07:18.876
[Garland Bayliss]: I'd been to New Orleans once and Little Rock a lot of times.

07:18.956 --> 07:20.718
[Garland Bayliss]: They were then small.

07:21.258 --> 07:29.226
[Garland Bayliss]: So I go from there to New York, like thousands and thousands of people pulled out of the farms or rural areas in the cities to different environments.

07:29.726 --> 07:32.409
[Garland Bayliss]: And I walked the streets in New York looking at tall buildings.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.872
[Garland Bayliss]: First time I had liberty, I got lost, went to the wrong place.

07:36.552 --> 07:38.855
[Garland Bayliss]: But I finally got back to Columbia University.

07:38.875 --> 07:39.335
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

07:39.355 --> 07:42.578
[Garland Bayliss]: And I was commissioned there in early October 1944.

07:42.642 --> 07:51.691
[Tom Turbiville]: Now, when you left Columbia and came back home on your way to the West Coast to be deployed, did you know at that time where you were going to be assigned that you were going to be assigned to a transport ship?

07:51.751 --> 07:52.672
[Garland Bayliss]: Yes, I already had my orders.

07:52.692 --> 07:53.493
[Garland Bayliss]: You already had your orders.

07:53.653 --> 07:59.979
[Garland Bayliss]: And they gave me 10-day leave en route to California to Long Beach to pick up my ship.

07:59.999 --> 08:03.743
[Garland Bayliss]: And that ship at that point had made only one trip, and that was to Hawaii.

08:03.883 --> 08:04.163
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

08:04.243 --> 08:08.127
[Garland Bayliss]: They took 400 of various types of personnel there.

08:08.107 --> 08:18.218
[Garland Bayliss]: We loaded in Long Beach a mixed group, OSS, which was a precursor of the CIA, Red Cross personnel,

08:18.535 --> 08:21.220
[Garland Bayliss]: an Army mule pack outfit.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.382
[Garland Bayliss]: We did not have the mules.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.285
[Garland Bayliss]: We took them to Calcutta.

08:24.846 --> 08:32.960
[Garland Bayliss]: They got their mules, and then they had a mule pack train across the Lido Road from India to China.

08:32.980 --> 08:33.981
[Garland Bayliss]: So they were interesting.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.664
[Garland Bayliss]: They trained in Colorado.

08:36.325 --> 08:37.668
[Garland Bayliss]: Interesting, interesting people.

08:39.130 --> 08:42.636
[Tom Turbiville]: That's the one thing about your service and your deployment was that

08:43.055 --> 08:46.211
[Tom Turbiville]: You met all kinds of people and who you transported.

08:46.633 --> 08:47.135
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's go back.

08:47.156 --> 08:49.065
[Tom Turbiville]: You went home and you went to San Francisco.

08:49.265 --> 08:51.007
[Garland Bayliss]: Long Beach that time.

08:51.027 --> 08:51.789
[Garland Bayliss]: Right, Long Beach.

08:52.209 --> 08:52.990
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about the vessel.

08:53.611 --> 08:57.336
[Tom Turbiville]: It was named after a General J.H.

08:57.356 --> 09:01.803
[Tom Turbiville]: McCray, who I looked up and found out that he was a military man of the 1800s.

09:02.143 --> 09:03.525
[Tom Turbiville]: I don't know much more about his history.

09:03.545 --> 09:04.286
[Garland Bayliss]: I don't know either.

09:04.607 --> 09:08.212
[Tom Turbiville]: But it was actually called the AP Auxiliary Personnel 149.

09:08.292 --> 09:10.856
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk a little bit about the ship.

09:10.876 --> 09:14.040
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a large ship, obviously, because you were able to

09:14.020 --> 09:16.983
[Tom Turbiville]: to bring aboard 3,000 plus a crew of how many?

09:17.163 --> 09:18.104
[Garland Bayliss]: About 430.

09:18.204 --> 09:18.585
[Tom Turbiville]: About 430.

09:18.905 --> 09:20.547
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about the ship.

09:20.567 --> 09:22.008
[Tom Turbiville]: Was it pretty crowded?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.329
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, it was pretty crowded.

09:23.550 --> 09:30.337
[Garland Bayliss]: As indicated in his earlier remarks, it was built as a transport in the Kaiser shipyards.

09:30.357 --> 09:31.398
[Garland Bayliss]: It was not a conversion.

09:32.098 --> 09:33.099
[Garland Bayliss]: So we were set up.

09:33.780 --> 09:37.984
[Garland Bayliss]: We complement our troops three meals a day.

09:38.024 --> 09:38.965
[Garland Bayliss]: Many just got two.

09:39.506 --> 09:41.648
[Garland Bayliss]: But we were so designed that we could turn it out.

09:42.134 --> 09:44.461
[Garland Bayliss]: and we knew how many would go into every compartment.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.815
[Garland Bayliss]: And so we loaded these troops, we would stand at the top and count them down.

09:49.336 --> 09:52.566
[Garland Bayliss]: One poor guy in Long Beach at my abandoned ship station,

09:52.732 --> 09:54.114
[Garland Bayliss]: came there with his helmet liner.

09:54.535 --> 09:56.939
[Garland Bayliss]: He was seasick every time I saw him.

09:57.399 --> 09:59.042
[Garland Bayliss]: He always had his helmet liner.

09:59.463 --> 10:03.129
[Garland Bayliss]: And those of you guys in the Army and the Marine Corps know what a helmet liner is.

10:03.149 --> 10:04.811
[Garland Bayliss]: And it had many uses.

10:04.831 --> 10:06.935
[Garland Bayliss]: One was to catch whatever he had, probably.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.337
[Tom Turbiville]: Exactly.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.342
[Tom Turbiville]: He was throwing up from California to Calcutta, right?

10:11.362 --> 10:11.702
[Garland Bayliss]: That's right.

10:11.802 --> 10:14.166
[Garland Bayliss]: We made one stop in route at Melbourne, Australia.

10:14.534 --> 10:19.781
[Garland Bayliss]: It was 40 days and 40 nights to get from California through Melbourne into Calcutta.

10:20.043 --> 10:22.958
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm gonna talk about that trip a little bit more in a minute,

10:23.275 --> 10:28.220
[Tom Turbiville]: But talk about what your job on the ship was just a little bit of everything.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.842
[Garland Bayliss]: It wasn't one specific job.

10:29.862 --> 10:30.663
[Garland Bayliss]: You had to rotate.

10:30.803 --> 10:36.088
[Garland Bayliss]: A junior officer putting on board a vessel then, a lot of OJT on-the-job training.

10:36.569 --> 10:49.502
[Garland Bayliss]: They take you aboard, and you'll spend three or four weeks with the communication officer, three or four weeks with the first lieutenant who was in charge of all the deck, three or four weeks with the navigation officer, and you made this circular around.

10:50.056 --> 10:55.165
[Garland Bayliss]: I did not get that OJ on-the-job training with the engineering officer.

10:55.185 --> 10:56.447
[Garland Bayliss]: I'll come back to that in just a moment.

10:57.109 --> 10:59.934
[Garland Bayliss]: At the same time, you're being trained as an officer today.

11:00.294 --> 11:03.099
[Garland Bayliss]: You were called a J-O-O-D, junior officer day.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.884
[Garland Bayliss]: And that was three months training period.

11:05.904 --> 11:08.689
[Garland Bayliss]: At the end of that, you were then

11:08.669 --> 11:10.391
[Garland Bayliss]: said to be an officer of the deck.

11:10.712 --> 11:18.842
[Garland Bayliss]: Now what that meant is, remember that ship was 417 feet long, 78 feet on the beam, and about 17,000 tons.

11:19.083 --> 11:30.077
[Garland Bayliss]: And so you had this crew of 400 plus, anywhere from 2,800, 3,000 troops, and you're sailing the ocean blue, and you're responsible during that four hours you have the watch.

11:30.878 --> 11:33.201
[Garland Bayliss]: And if you have any problem, you call the skipper.

11:33.602 --> 11:35.585
[Garland Bayliss]: His cabin was just behind the bridge.

11:35.605 --> 11:35.925
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

11:36.563 --> 11:43.572
[Tom Turbiville]: So that's what you trained to become officer of the day, and when you were officer of the day, the skipper might begin taking a nap.

11:43.612 --> 11:44.733
[Tom Turbiville]: You were in charge of the officer.

11:44.753 --> 11:45.134
[Garland Bayliss]: Whoever.

11:45.154 --> 11:45.835
[Garland Bayliss]: He was asleep.

11:46.135 --> 11:50.240
[Garland Bayliss]: Whoever had the watch, it was your responsibility.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.103
[Garland Bayliss]: That's already heavy for a 20-year-old boy.

11:52.543 --> 11:53.164
[Tom Turbiville]: I bet it is.

11:53.404 --> 11:54.986
[Tom Turbiville]: I want to talk about that more later.

11:56.047 --> 11:59.652
[Tom Turbiville]: Your first trip from California, you said you stopped in Melbourne to Calcutta.

12:00.172 --> 12:02.977
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a little bit unique in that you had an escort.

12:03.017 --> 12:08.085
[Tom Turbiville]: You said you had a tin can, a destroyer, you had a munition ship, an oiler.

12:08.105 --> 12:10.228
[Tom Turbiville]: But that didn't work out the way you wanted it to.

12:10.249 --> 12:10.850
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, not exactly.

12:11.310 --> 12:14.075
[Garland Bayliss]: We always deemed alone except for this.

12:14.776 --> 12:22.088
[Garland Bayliss]: The only time we were in a small convoy with an escort, we had this Australian destroyer tin can just ahead of us.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.490
[Garland Bayliss]: We were in the center just behind.

12:23.931 --> 12:26.415
[Garland Bayliss]: Port and Starbury was a munition ship and an oiler.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.938
[Garland Bayliss]: So we're steaming along, minding our own business.

12:29.438 --> 12:30.940
[Garland Bayliss]: Next thing was mid-afternoon.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.564
[Garland Bayliss]: We see the destroyer throwing depth charge off the stern.

12:35.485 --> 12:36.746
[Garland Bayliss]: He thought he had a submarine.

12:36.846 --> 12:37.707
[Tom Turbiville]: How far behind are you?

12:38.608 --> 12:39.689
[Garland Bayliss]: Oh, my goodness.

12:40.350 --> 12:41.211
[Garland Bayliss]: Maybe a hundred yards.

12:41.531 --> 12:42.412
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay.

12:42.552 --> 12:42.993
[Garland Bayliss]: I guess.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.114
[Garland Bayliss]: I have to think pretty far about it.

12:44.134 --> 12:44.895
[Garland Bayliss]: About a hundred yards.

12:44.935 --> 12:45.736
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

12:45.756 --> 12:46.657
[Garland Bayliss]: But it's close enough.

12:46.737 --> 12:47.978
[Tom Turbiville]: That's a soft pitching wedge.

12:47.998 --> 12:48.318
[Garland Bayliss]: Yes.

12:49.119 --> 12:52.723
[Garland Bayliss]: And so we had to veer the starboard and avoid the munition ship.

12:53.227 --> 12:56.915
[Garland Bayliss]: Nothing happened, but there was a conversation between the two skippers.

12:57.115 --> 13:00.782
[Garland Bayliss]: They were supposed to tell us before they dropped the depth charges.

13:01.123 --> 13:05.913
[Garland Bayliss]: Now, had it been a Jap submarine, I would have been happy, a Japanese submarine, what I'm supposed to say now.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.999
[Tom Turbiville]: You would have liked to have known, so you wouldn't be on top of it.

13:09.019 --> 13:09.500
[Garland Bayliss]: That's right.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.562
[Tom Turbiville]: So you had to do a little bit of it.

13:10.602 --> 13:12.366
[Garland Bayliss]: If he was down here, it may have scared him off, too.

13:13.156 --> 13:15.640
[Tom Turbiville]: So after that, y'all decided you'd rather be alone.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.902
[Tom Turbiville]: You can handle this by yourself.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.626
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, we're never given the opportunity to sail.

13:19.646 --> 13:22.130
[Garland Bayliss]: So we sailed all over the Atlantic, the Indian, the China Sea.

13:23.472 --> 13:26.476
[Garland Bayliss]: Wherever we went, we were always alone, except for that one time.

13:26.636 --> 13:27.057
[Garland Bayliss]: Exactly.

13:27.117 --> 13:28.359
[Garland Bayliss]: What you do, you zigzag.

13:29.040 --> 13:29.681
[Garland Bayliss]: Right, yeah, sure.

13:29.841 --> 13:34.388
[Garland Bayliss]: You have a path, starboard five degrees, so on, port, whatever it may be.

13:34.452 --> 13:43.467
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about the passengers on that first trip and you started to talk about that OSS, Office of Strategic Service, which is sort of pre-CIA, right?

13:43.487 --> 13:46.712
[Tom Turbiville]: And mule pack outfit out of Colorado, Red Cross and others.

13:46.832 --> 13:50.478
[Tom Turbiville]: So it was really a potpourri of all kinds of personnel that were fighting the war.

13:50.498 --> 13:52.461
[Garland Bayliss]: We had a few wags.

13:52.441 --> 13:52.942
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

13:53.762 --> 13:54.363
[Tom Turbiville]: That was okay.

13:54.383 --> 13:54.984
[Garland Bayliss]: That was okay.

13:55.044 --> 13:56.025
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.506
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, there's a story that I can't tell you.

13:59.428 --> 14:00.389
[Garland Bayliss]: Not with me.

14:01.110 --> 14:02.091
[Tom Turbiville]: Better not.

14:03.513 --> 14:12.382
[Tom Turbiville]: Out of Calcutta, you talked about how you had elements of the 20th Air Force that you were taking to Tinian Island where they were going to stage for the bombing of Japan.

14:12.762 --> 14:15.485
[Tom Turbiville]: So talk a little bit more about that trip.

14:15.525 --> 14:20.170
[Garland Bayliss]: We came into Calcutta up the Hooghly River, which is a tributary of the

14:20.757 --> 14:25.243
[Garland Bayliss]: Ganges, the largest ship they'd ever seen, didn't know how to tie us up.

14:25.263 --> 14:29.289
[Garland Bayliss]: But they finally got us tied up, and we offloaded the people that we had there.

14:30.050 --> 14:40.123
[Garland Bayliss]: And there's still an army lieutenant looking for me, because while there, he bought a suitcase, a cigarette lighter, and something else that I was supposed to send his wife when I got back to the States.

14:40.544 --> 14:41.685
[Garland Bayliss]: I never found the address.

14:42.106 --> 14:46.512
[Garland Bayliss]: So he's probably still fussing at that sailor who took his goods, not deliberately.

14:47.015 --> 14:50.962
[Garland Bayliss]: But when we get into Calcutta, they're about three or four days.

14:50.982 --> 14:53.587
[Garland Bayliss]: And then that's when we load elements of the 20th Air Force.

14:54.228 --> 14:54.669
[Garland Bayliss]: Three days.

14:55.049 --> 15:00.619
[Garland Bayliss]: We started getting messages underway from Tokyo Rose, who was part of their psychological warfare.

15:01.321 --> 15:04.406
[Garland Bayliss]: Said we would be sunk three days out of Calcutta.

15:04.426 --> 15:06.089
[Garland Bayliss]: She knew the name of our skipper, T.R.

15:06.149 --> 15:06.610
[Garland Bayliss]: Cowie.

15:07.163 --> 15:11.430
[Garland Bayliss]: The name of the colonel would come in and it was the 20th, and where we'd been and where we were going.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.714
[Garland Bayliss]: That makes you anxious, to say the least.

15:13.735 --> 15:14.476
[Garland Bayliss]: Exactly.

15:14.496 --> 15:20.046
[Garland Bayliss]: And we were at General Quarters, oh, probably 24 to 36 hours.

15:20.627 --> 15:23.732
[Garland Bayliss]: But nothing happened, but that was part of it.

15:23.752 --> 15:25.014
[Garland Bayliss]: And she got our attention.

15:25.034 --> 15:25.976
[Garland Bayliss]: It made us anxious.

15:26.176 --> 15:26.757
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

15:26.777 --> 15:27.839
[Tom Turbiville]: The psychological warfare.

15:27.859 --> 15:28.881
[Garland Bayliss]: The psychological warfare.

15:29.202 --> 15:29.823
[Tom Turbiville]: Exactly.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.686
[Tom Turbiville]: So you were expecting any time that...

15:32.189 --> 15:33.150
[Tom Turbiville]: It could happen.

15:33.190 --> 15:34.973
[Tom Turbiville]: Yeah, it was a legitimate threat.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.917
[Garland Bayliss]: That they know who you are and where you've been and where you're going.

15:38.158 --> 15:38.638
[Tom Turbiville]: That's right.

15:38.879 --> 15:42.784
[Tom Turbiville]: So you had to be ready, and general quarters for over a day, almost 48 hours.

15:42.804 --> 15:43.966
[Garland Bayliss]: Over 24 hours, yeah.

15:43.986 --> 15:44.547
[Tom Turbiville]: Right, right.

15:45.068 --> 15:47.611
[Tom Turbiville]: At Tinian, you steamed empty to New Guinea.

15:48.392 --> 15:50.435
[Tom Turbiville]: And talk about that.

15:50.595 --> 15:52.358
[Tom Turbiville]: It was about...

15:52.338 --> 15:57.546
[Tom Turbiville]: When you got to New Guinea, the people that you loaded on at that time.

15:57.566 --> 15:58.227
[Garland Bayliss]: We unloaded.

15:58.828 --> 16:00.791
[Garland Bayliss]: I think there's about 2,700 of these.

16:01.432 --> 16:08.883
[Garland Bayliss]: All these soldiers and nurses had been in New Guinea anywhere from 24 to 28, some 36 months.

16:09.384 --> 16:12.889
[Garland Bayliss]: I can't be exact because I'm going on the stories they told us.

16:12.910 --> 16:15.694
[Garland Bayliss]: Nearly all were yellow from taking Adderburn.

16:15.714 --> 16:20.421
[Garland Bayliss]: Many had jungle rods that you pick up.

16:20.401 --> 16:21.683
[Garland Bayliss]: I was on that three days.

16:21.803 --> 16:23.646
[Garland Bayliss]: I managed to get on my right foot.

16:23.666 --> 16:24.967
[Garland Bayliss]: Took years to ever get rid of it.

16:26.189 --> 16:28.613
[Garland Bayliss]: But we loaded these folks aboard.

16:29.253 --> 16:30.956
[Garland Bayliss]: Many were in pretty bad shape.

16:30.976 --> 16:32.117
[Garland Bayliss]: We had this one soldier.

16:32.178 --> 16:35.682
[Garland Bayliss]: He would sit, put his head back into bulkhead and look at the other one.

16:36.223 --> 16:37.705
[Garland Bayliss]: And we called the bulkhead stair.

16:38.226 --> 16:42.172
[Garland Bayliss]: He just sat there and looked at nothing except another steel bulkhead.

16:43.453 --> 16:48.180
[Garland Bayliss]: We had one army nurse who had apparently having psychological problems.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.549
[Garland Bayliss]: She had jungle rot very badly, could not keep clothes.

16:51.569 --> 16:56.401
[Garland Bayliss]: We had to improvise a padded shell, a place for her.

16:56.962 --> 16:58.587
[Garland Bayliss]: Then we had one soldier to die.

16:59.188 --> 17:03.098
[Garland Bayliss]: None of us had to conduct a barrel at sea, so we broke out the manual.

17:03.483 --> 17:06.026
[Garland Bayliss]: The carpenter made the wooden rack.

17:06.966 --> 17:10.770
[Garland Bayliss]: We sewed him in canvas, put shells and other weights in there.

17:11.211 --> 17:13.393
[Garland Bayliss]: The chaplain said the appropriate words.

17:14.294 --> 17:20.139
[Garland Bayliss]: And we, as you've seen the movies, we dumped him into the sea.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.421
[Garland Bayliss]: We didn't want to do that very often.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.944
[Garland Bayliss]: That was the only time that that happened.

17:24.964 --> 17:26.926
[Garland Bayliss]: We did not have the facilities to keep the body.

17:28.067 --> 17:28.748
[Garland Bayliss]: Exactly.

17:29.032 --> 17:37.340
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about, this was in New Guinea, where they had been actually in New Guinea about 27, 28 months.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.863
[Tom Turbiville]: Something like that.

17:40.903 --> 17:44.106
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about the burial at sea.

17:46.488 --> 17:51.552
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk a little bit more about the boat itself.

17:52.674 --> 17:55.156
[Tom Turbiville]: You said that it was a crowded situation.

17:55.236 --> 17:57.638
[Tom Turbiville]: Was it one of the boats where you always had to duck around and

17:57.618 --> 17:59.922
[Tom Turbiville]: And you bump your head a lot of places.

17:59.942 --> 18:01.765
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, you're always bumping your head.

18:01.785 --> 18:02.366
[Garland Bayliss]: And I had hair.

18:02.386 --> 18:03.848
[Garland Bayliss]: The ship, excuse me, please.

18:03.868 --> 18:04.329
[Garland Bayliss]: I'm sorry.

18:04.369 --> 18:05.130
[Garland Bayliss]: I'm correct him on that.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.432
[Garland Bayliss]: I had hair at the end.

18:06.472 --> 18:08.856
[Garland Bayliss]: It didn't bother me twice to hit my head.

18:09.417 --> 18:13.023
[Garland Bayliss]: But no, for the troops, it's especially crowded.

18:13.604 --> 18:14.445
[Garland Bayliss]: And we gave them.

18:14.425 --> 18:17.088
[Garland Bayliss]: freedom be on topside any time they want it to.

18:17.749 --> 18:25.158
[Garland Bayliss]: Of course, we always had to alert them, when you're topside at dark, do not strike a match to light your cigarette.

18:25.579 --> 18:30.905
[Garland Bayliss]: You can see a struck match in the butt of that cigarette about 14 to 16 miles.

18:31.305 --> 18:34.589
[Garland Bayliss]: It's where the Earth's curvature is such that it's no longer visible.

18:35.070 --> 18:41.698
[Garland Bayliss]: But that's an open signal for anybody who may be out there who might want to take a shot at you.

18:41.678 --> 18:43.743
[Garland Bayliss]: Now, our guys learned pretty quickly.

18:43.863 --> 18:46.089
[Garland Bayliss]: Later, I mentioned the Australian troops.

18:46.430 --> 18:47.452
[Garland Bayliss]: Right, right.

18:47.733 --> 18:48.775
[Tom Turbiville]: No, go ahead and do that now.

18:49.397 --> 18:50.620
[Tom Turbiville]: You like the Australians.

18:50.740 --> 18:58.860
[Garland Bayliss]: You gained a lot of respect for them and their country and all of that, but sometimes you had to... Well, we went into towns in Australia,

18:59.532 --> 19:01.894
[Garland Bayliss]: This is our second visit to Australia.

19:02.315 --> 19:07.199
[Garland Bayliss]: We loaded, again, about 2,800, 2,150 Australian troops.

19:07.219 --> 19:14.126
[Garland Bayliss]: And as they came aboard, I was standing at the head of the gangway leading down to a compartment that held 120 soldiers.

19:14.146 --> 19:17.950
[Garland Bayliss]: Soon the word came up, sir, there are no more bunks.

19:18.010 --> 19:19.251
[Garland Bayliss]: I said, I know there are bunks.

19:19.751 --> 19:20.532
[Garland Bayliss]: So I went down.

19:20.892 --> 19:26.738
[Garland Bayliss]: They were throwing the gear on one bunk, got themselves on the other, said, I'm sorry, guys, you only get one bunk.

19:26.718 --> 19:28.420
[Garland Bayliss]: So we worked that out.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.383
[Garland Bayliss]: But they were very pleasant people.

19:31.544 --> 19:37.070
[Garland Bayliss]: I liked both Melbourne a great deal and Townsville a great deal and the people we met interacted with.

19:37.090 --> 19:42.316
[Garland Bayliss]: Now, just before we got into Townsville, we had pushed our crew to chip and paint the deck.

19:42.677 --> 19:44.158
[Garland Bayliss]: Any sailor knows what that means.

19:44.699 --> 19:48.123
[Garland Bayliss]: You get on your deck, you chip all the loose paint and you repaint it.

19:48.443 --> 19:50.866
[Garland Bayliss]: We want this ship to look good for our Australian friends.

19:51.627 --> 19:54.631
[Garland Bayliss]: So they come aboard with their hobnail boots.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.932
[Garland Bayliss]: As I understand it,

19:56.435 --> 19:59.599
[Garland Bayliss]: soldiers in the British Empire wore hobnails.

19:59.999 --> 20:04.424
[Garland Bayliss]: And literally, if you look upside down, the whole bottom had its little nail head.

20:04.444 --> 20:05.325
[Garland Bayliss]: And it was for traction.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.726
[Garland Bayliss]: Great if you need it.

20:07.187 --> 20:10.651
[Garland Bayliss]: But in a couple of days, you could not find any paint on our deck.

20:11.191 --> 20:12.933
[Garland Bayliss]: And our sailors not very, very happy.

20:13.374 --> 20:15.336
[Garland Bayliss]: All their work had gone to naught.

20:15.356 --> 20:17.639
[Tom Turbiville]: They'd worked hard on that deck.

20:17.659 --> 20:24.266
[Garland Bayliss]: You said that you were- We took those to Timor, T-I-M-O-R, for the Dutch East Indies.

20:24.406 --> 20:25.227
[Garland Bayliss]: I see.

20:25.848 --> 20:29.593
[Tom Turbiville]: You said that you never came under attack in those two years.

20:29.974 --> 20:38.025
[Tom Turbiville]: Looking back, is that somewhat surprising considering that you were a troop transport and you would think from the enemy standpoint that that would be a prime target?

20:38.085 --> 20:38.746
[Garland Bayliss]: You would think so.

20:39.047 --> 20:41.711
[Garland Bayliss]: Especially Tokyo Rose knew who we were and what we were doing.

20:42.592 --> 20:44.835
[Garland Bayliss]: But occasionally we would have sightings

20:44.815 --> 20:48.762
[Garland Bayliss]: of what appeared to be periscopes, but no one ever bothers.

20:49.143 --> 20:53.551
[Garland Bayliss]: We never shot in anger at anybody, and we're always thankful.

20:53.591 --> 21:02.107
[Garland Bayliss]: Honestly, when you're steaming in any of your waters, whether it's Japanese or German, it worries you.

21:02.808 --> 21:04.191
[Garland Bayliss]: Those can always happen.

21:04.171 --> 21:11.150
[Garland Bayliss]: And on our board, we had two 5-inch 38s, which are our main armament.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.139
[Garland Bayliss]: We had 20 millimeters and 40 millimeters anti-aircraft.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.488
[Garland Bayliss]: We practiced a lot, but we never shot at anger.

21:17.992 --> 21:24.178
[Tom Turbiville]: You eventually went to the Philippines to take troops back to the States before going to Europe via the Panama Canal.

21:24.699 --> 21:27.362
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's get you over to the Atlantic after we look at some photographs.

21:27.742 --> 21:30.065
[Tom Turbiville]: We've got some pictures that you have supplied us.

21:30.745 --> 21:34.409
[Tom Turbiville]: And there is a young Ensign Garland Bayliss, I guess.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.672
[Tom Turbiville]: About how old were you thinking?

21:36.692 --> 21:36.812
[Garland Bayliss]: 20.

21:36.832 --> 21:37.613
[Garland Bayliss]: 20?

21:38.533 --> 21:38.994
[Tom Turbiville]: Great hair.

21:39.474 --> 21:40.255
[Garland Bayliss]: Great hair, thank you.

21:40.275 --> 21:40.856
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah, you bet.

21:41.537 --> 21:43.018
[Tom Turbiville]: You bet.

21:43.138 --> 21:44.460
[Tom Turbiville]: There's your ship.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.682
[Garland Bayliss]: That's the Mighty Mac, the Terror of the Pacific.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.965
[Tom Turbiville]: There it is, the General J.H.

21:51.065 --> 21:51.606
[Tom Turbiville]: McCray.

21:53.609 --> 21:54.811
[Tom Turbiville]: You're one of the people in that picture.

21:54.831 --> 21:55.853
[Garland Bayliss]: I'm one facing you.

21:57.295 --> 22:00.059
[Garland Bayliss]: With my hands on my hips, I'm not sure why.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.205
[Garland Bayliss]: I think we're tied up there in Manus Island in the U.S.

22:04.987 --> 22:07.911
[Garland Bayliss]: That is somewhere in the Atlantic.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.113
[Tom Turbiville]: Now, was that a pose picture?

22:09.133 --> 22:10.276
[Garland Bayliss]: Sir, he was posed.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.019
[Tom Turbiville]: That's what I was thinking.

22:12.059 --> 22:14.484
[Tom Turbiville]: You were just sitting there just looking out over the water.

22:14.504 --> 22:16.007
[Tom Turbiville]: No, I just wanted to see her looking over the water.

22:16.027 --> 22:19.715
[Tom Turbiville]: They said, yeah, it looks like it could be used for a recruiting poster.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.837
[Tom Turbiville]: Yes.

22:21.948 --> 22:23.851
[Tom Turbiville]: I found this.

22:24.792 --> 22:25.493
[Garland Bayliss]: I'm glad you did.

22:25.714 --> 22:29.440
[Tom Turbiville]: And that's a sort of a sketch of the same.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.184
[Garland Bayliss]: See, if you look at it, the anchor's not there yet.

22:32.444 --> 22:32.725
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

22:33.826 --> 22:34.107
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

22:34.367 --> 22:35.369
[Tom Turbiville]: The U.S.

22:35.389 --> 22:36.531
[Tom Turbiville]: General J.H.

22:36.551 --> 22:37.031
[Tom Turbiville]: McRae.

22:38.013 --> 22:39.275
[Tom Turbiville]: And now this is at Columbia, right?

22:39.295 --> 22:40.998
[Garland Bayliss]: Columbia University Midshipment School.

22:41.478 --> 22:44.563
[Garland Bayliss]: And there's the Corps of Midshipmen in Parade right there.

22:46.096 --> 22:48.119
[Garland Bayliss]: I want you to see every man there had a hat on.

22:48.319 --> 22:49.220
[Garland Bayliss]: That was 1944.

22:50.001 --> 22:50.882
[Tom Turbiville]: It was all military.

22:50.902 --> 22:51.723
[Tom Turbiville]: Here's our last picture.

22:51.983 --> 22:56.829
[Tom Turbiville]: And like I say, that looks like a picture that could be on a Navy recruiting poster right there.

22:56.969 --> 22:58.291
[Tom Turbiville]: That's a good-looking sailor.

22:58.431 --> 22:59.032
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, thank you.

22:59.052 --> 23:00.674
[Tom Turbiville]: Boy, the white teeth and everything.

23:00.854 --> 23:02.616
[Garland Bayliss]: And hair.

23:02.877 --> 23:03.297
[Tom Turbiville]: And hair.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.621
[Tom Turbiville]: I bet you got some dates from that picture.

23:06.702 --> 23:07.643
[Tom Turbiville]: You hadn't met Mary yet.

23:07.703 --> 23:08.904
[Garland Bayliss]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

23:08.924 --> 23:11.888
[Tom Turbiville]: It never hurt.

23:12.709 --> 23:15.192
[Tom Turbiville]: Well, you were talking about at...

23:16.015 --> 23:19.140
[Tom Turbiville]: Now, I'm sorry, that picture we saw before, was that at Columbia or the Citadel?

23:19.661 --> 23:20.943
[Tom Turbiville]: That was at Columbia?

23:20.963 --> 23:21.163
[Garland Bayliss]: No.

23:21.844 --> 23:27.613
[Garland Bayliss]: The other one was after I left Columbia because I'd already been to the Pacific and I was back home on leave.

23:27.633 --> 23:28.014
[Garland Bayliss]: Okay.

23:28.034 --> 23:31.840
[Garland Bayliss]: The one in the sailor outfit was just before I started midshipmen school.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.622
[Tom Turbiville]: The picture of the review that we just looked at.

23:33.642 --> 23:37.268
[Garland Bayliss]: That was in September 1944 at Columbia University.

23:37.288 --> 23:38.229
[Tom Turbiville]: At Columbia University.

23:38.410 --> 23:38.790
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay.

23:38.810 --> 23:43.778
[Tom Turbiville]: Because we're going to get on later talking about the Citadel later on.

23:44.467 --> 23:52.044
[Tom Turbiville]: From the Pacific to the Atlantic, through the Panama Canal, and you went to, you landed at Lahore, France, where, again, the same job.

23:52.104 --> 23:54.890
[Tom Turbiville]: You picked up troops, took them back to the States and wherever they needed to go.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.075
[Garland Bayliss]: We took them back this time to Norfolk.

23:57.899 --> 24:01.763
[Tom Turbiville]: The Atlantic Ocean was a little bit more of a challenge than the Pacific.

24:01.783 --> 24:10.993
[Tom Turbiville]: You had some, obviously, some challenges in the Pacific as far as the weather and the currents and the waves and the storms and all that, but the Atlantic was particularly mean, right?

24:11.013 --> 24:14.056
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, one thing, it's a smaller body of water.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.459
[Garland Bayliss]: The storms can be bad in either.

24:16.899 --> 24:17.320
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

24:17.340 --> 24:24.387
[Garland Bayliss]: But I think it was on that trip, from going to New York, I guess you're asking about that heavy storm.

24:24.407 --> 24:25.448
[Tom Turbiville]: Right, yes, sir.

24:25.829 --> 24:27.130
[Garland Bayliss]: In a normal steaming,

24:27.683 --> 24:32.030
[Garland Bayliss]: We would do about 420, 424 nautical miles in 24 hours.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.011
[Garland Bayliss]: About 10 to 12 knots.

24:33.031 --> 24:33.332
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

24:33.552 --> 24:33.872
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

24:33.893 --> 24:36.416
[Garland Bayliss]: Then there's one particular storm in the North Atlantic.

24:37.298 --> 24:42.245
[Garland Bayliss]: As best we could figure, we may have made 11 nautical miles forward.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.791
[Garland Bayliss]: In those seas, all you can do is keep your bow into the sea.

24:46.191 --> 24:48.154
[Garland Bayliss]: That is where the waves are coming to you.

24:48.174 --> 24:52.942
[Garland Bayliss]: If you ever fall off, then that wave hits you broadside and you have to go over.

24:53.142 --> 24:54.224
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

24:54.364 --> 24:54.484
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

24:54.464 --> 24:56.827
[Tom Turbiville]: Almost like road waves type of thing.

24:57.407 --> 24:57.788
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

24:57.808 --> 25:00.871
[Garland Bayliss]: I think it was in that one, or the one in the Pacific.

25:00.891 --> 25:04.175
[Garland Bayliss]: We had a sailor standing there to watch our, not a Ticometer.

25:04.195 --> 25:04.896
[Garland Bayliss]: It's a device.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.179
[Garland Bayliss]: It's a big thing with an arrow.

25:07.599 --> 25:11.764
[Garland Bayliss]: As it goes to your right of the starboard, it would get down there.

25:11.784 --> 25:13.406
[Garland Bayliss]: It would shudder and shudder and shudder.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.328
[Garland Bayliss]: Then it'd come back and shudder.

25:17.110 --> 25:20.594
[Garland Bayliss]: If you went beyond a certain point, you kept going.

25:20.614 --> 25:23.357
[Garland Bayliss]: One of the things we could have done about it, if it happened,

25:23.540 --> 25:33.893
[Garland Bayliss]: But you're sitting here watching it, and especially if you're the OD, the officer of the deck, and if that thing turned on your watch, it's a bad scene.

25:33.913 --> 25:34.353
[Garland Bayliss]: Exactly.

25:35.615 --> 25:39.600
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about some of the waves were hitting at 140 feet because they were coming over the side.

25:42.023 --> 25:44.986
[Garland Bayliss]: From the bow, the form was 144 feet tall.

25:45.287 --> 25:48.350
[Garland Bayliss]: As we're hitting the sea, the waves broke all the way over.

25:48.931 --> 25:50.253
[Garland Bayliss]: I better keep my hands down.

25:51.314 --> 25:52.095
[Garland Bayliss]: My wife will get me.

25:52.075 --> 26:01.723
[Tom Turbiville]: You had an assignment to take some elements of the 9th from Europe back to the Pacific for the staging of the ground war.

26:01.743 --> 26:02.584
[Garland Bayliss]: That was from Marseille.

26:02.804 --> 26:03.425
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

26:03.445 --> 26:11.031
[Tom Turbiville]: But while you were in the Atlantic, you got word that the bomb had been dropped in Japan and that the war was over in Japan.

26:11.372 --> 26:12.953
[Tom Turbiville]: And you were in the right place for that.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.775
[Garland Bayliss]: Talk about that.

26:14.795 --> 26:21.981
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, we unloaded these troops to take them back through the Panama to

26:23.227 --> 26:27.411
[Garland Bayliss]: probably the Philippines, we were unclear on that, for staging to invade Japan.

26:28.072 --> 26:40.826
[Garland Bayliss]: The war was over in Japan, and someone in the Pentagon made the decision that all those ships transporting troops that had already transited, passed through the Panama, would continue to their destination.

26:41.446 --> 26:45.971
[Garland Bayliss]: Those who had not, us, we were diverted to New York City.

26:45.991 --> 26:47.753
[Garland Bayliss]: And talk about happy people.

26:48.294 --> 26:52.238
[Garland Bayliss]: When we passed the word, that ship rocked not from seas,

26:52.218 --> 26:54.140
[Garland Bayliss]: But from happy soldiers.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.001
[Garland Bayliss]: That's right.

26:55.021 --> 26:56.002
[Garland Bayliss]: And I don't blame them.

26:56.022 --> 26:56.262
[Garland Bayliss]: No.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.724
[Garland Bayliss]: And they broke out all sorts of stuff you drink.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.806
[Garland Bayliss]: I don't know what it was or where they had it.

27:01.127 --> 27:06.211
[Tom Turbiville]: Because they all of a sudden their course just changed to New York City instead of going to get ready.

27:06.232 --> 27:06.852
[Garland Bayliss]: To invade Japan.

27:06.872 --> 27:07.413
[Tom Turbiville]: For a ground war.

27:07.753 --> 27:08.173
[Tom Turbiville]: That's right.

27:08.193 --> 27:08.434
[Tom Turbiville]: Yeah.

27:08.474 --> 27:10.576
[Tom Turbiville]: No wonder that they were happy.

27:10.796 --> 27:17.162
[Tom Turbiville]: You were actually on the ship until 1946, really long after the war because there was a lot more transporting to be done.

27:17.182 --> 27:17.923
[Tom Turbiville]: To bring people back.

27:17.943 --> 27:18.263
[Tom Turbiville]: Correct.

27:18.283 --> 27:19.204
[Tom Turbiville]: To bring people back.

27:19.184 --> 27:32.303
[Garland Bayliss]: On one of the trips through the Suez, we went both to what is now Pakistan and what is Basra, which you read about a lot in our war in Iraq, up to Persian Gulf to pick up troops.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.065
[Garland Bayliss]: I started talking to guys.

27:34.105 --> 27:35.127
[Garland Bayliss]: You know Jim Bayliss?

27:35.147 --> 27:35.467
[Garland Bayliss]: Yes.

27:35.988 --> 27:43.880
[Garland Bayliss]: That was my brother who I had not seen for over three years, and he had left Basra three weeks before I got there.

27:44.540 --> 27:49.107
[Garland Bayliss]: Otherwise, I would have had the chance to bring him home, but I did not.

27:49.087 --> 27:50.430
[Tom Turbiville]: We're running short on time.

27:50.510 --> 28:04.363
[Tom Turbiville]: So you finished in 46, like I say, in the summer of 1946 is when you got off the ship and you enrolled, came back, you enrolled in Arkansas at Fayetteville in the fall of 46, started business administration.

28:04.524 --> 28:05.526
[Tom Turbiville]: You, like me,

28:05.506 --> 28:09.050
[Tom Turbiville]: didn't think very too much of accounting and taking stat.

28:09.070 --> 28:10.292
[Garland Bayliss]: Well, they didn't think much of me.

28:11.874 --> 28:14.176
[Garland Bayliss]: We used to call it then, run and play with BBA.

28:14.797 --> 28:16.098
[Garland Bayliss]: And both drove me crazy.

28:16.159 --> 28:17.540
[Garland Bayliss]: So I went back to the sciences.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.742
[Garland Bayliss]: I started as a pre-med.

28:18.762 --> 28:19.022
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

28:19.362 --> 28:21.305
[Garland Bayliss]: And got my bachelor's in zoology and chemistry.

28:21.805 --> 28:22.005
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.027
[Garland Bayliss]: Taught a year in Dermott, Arkansas.

28:23.047 --> 28:24.669
[Garland Bayliss]: Taught public school in Dermott, Arkansas.

28:24.689 --> 28:25.830
[Garland Bayliss]: Then went to Orange, Texas.

28:26.010 --> 28:26.591
[Tom Turbiville]: Seventh grade.

28:26.891 --> 28:27.592
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

28:27.912 --> 28:28.733
[Garland Bayliss]: Seven through 12.

28:28.773 --> 28:29.034
[Garland Bayliss]: Yeah.

28:29.054 --> 28:30.135
[Garland Bayliss]: You said that's when you lost your hair.

28:30.155 --> 28:32.117
[Garland Bayliss]: I had seven different preparations every day.

28:32.338 --> 28:32.678
[Garland Bayliss]: Right.

28:32.658 --> 28:34.742
[Garland Bayliss]: And then to Orange work for DuPont.

28:35.183 --> 28:36.345
[Garland Bayliss]: That's where Mary and I met.

28:36.405 --> 28:40.714
[Garland Bayliss]: I decided to go to graduate school at the University of Texas in history.

28:40.974 --> 28:41.916
[Garland Bayliss]: Big switch.

28:41.936 --> 28:43.159
[Tom Turbiville]: You and Mary were married in 1950.

28:43.479 --> 28:44.281
[Tom Turbiville]: You bet.

28:44.301 --> 28:47.928
[Tom Turbiville]: You switched from the sciences, from business administration to the sciences to history.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.513
[Tom Turbiville]: And that took you to the Citadel for one year.

28:50.533 --> 28:51.676
[Tom Turbiville]: That was a great experience.

28:51.896 --> 28:52.337
[Tom Turbiville]: Great experience.

28:52.317 --> 28:55.783
[Tom Turbiville]: Your first son, David, was born there at the Citadel.

28:57.126 --> 29:05.721
[Tom Turbiville]: But you were there for only one year, and you had heard about Texas A&M from a professor that you had worked with at the University of Texas, right?

29:05.741 --> 29:09.188
[Garland Bayliss]: Ralph Steen, who's head of the department at A&M, was a visiting prof at UT.

29:09.869 --> 29:11.592
[Garland Bayliss]: Not having him in class, got to know him.

29:11.572 --> 29:26.031
[Garland Bayliss]: He called me once I got to the Citadel and in 55 the legislature passed a law requiring all graduates of Public University have six hours of American history six hours of poli-sci or government What do you want to call it?

29:26.612 --> 29:37.346
[Garland Bayliss]: He called me said they give me special money to hire five people if you ever think you're coming it's now So I did I regretted leaving after only one year at the Citadel, right?

29:37.366 --> 29:40.009
[Garland Bayliss]: But I did not think I could pass up the opportunity

29:39.989 --> 29:42.093
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked about how at the Citadel it was all military.

29:42.273 --> 29:46.119
[Tom Turbiville]: You yourself were in uniform as you taught classes there.

29:46.139 --> 29:53.732
[Tom Turbiville]: But then you came to A&M in 1956 and spent 34 years in the history department.

29:53.973 --> 29:58.420
[Tom Turbiville]: We could do a whole other show just on your time at Texas A&M.

29:58.721 --> 30:04.611
[Tom Turbiville]: But that was during a time I know you knew General Rudder quite well as fellow military men.

30:04.711 --> 30:06.013
[Garland Bayliss]: I had his order in class.

30:06.044 --> 30:06.366
[Tom Turbiville]: Right.

30:06.426 --> 30:08.757
[Tom Turbiville]: When you came, Bear Bryant was the head football coach.

30:08.777 --> 30:13.118
[Tom Turbiville]: And so 34 years at Texas A&M and retired in 19...

30:13.756 --> 30:15.939
[Garland Bayliss]: First time in 86 from full time, 1990.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.203
[Garland Bayliss]: For real.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.024
[Garland Bayliss]: Right, right.

30:19.084 --> 30:23.371
[Garland Bayliss]: That four years, I taught each fall semester during the football season.

30:23.391 --> 30:24.052
[Garland Bayliss]: Right, right.

30:24.092 --> 30:25.013
[Garland Bayliss]: It's part-time.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.155
[Tom Turbiville]: We're out of time.

30:26.736 --> 30:27.217
[Tom Turbiville]: Thank you.

30:27.237 --> 30:27.698
[Tom Turbiville]: Well, thank you.

30:27.838 --> 30:28.439
[Garland Bayliss]: Appreciate it.

30:28.479 --> 30:29.180
[Tom Turbiville]: Thank you very much.

30:29.200 --> 30:29.761
[Tom Turbiville]: Enjoy doing it.

30:29.781 --> 30:30.221
[Tom Turbiville]: It is.

30:30.241 --> 30:30.702
[Tom Turbiville]: It was fun.

30:31.043 --> 30:31.423
[Tom Turbiville]: Enjoyed it.

30:31.704 --> 30:39.055
