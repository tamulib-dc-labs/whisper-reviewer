Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:27.660 --> 00:32.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:35.820 --> 00:37.260
And here are your hosts.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.400
This is David Cruz.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.260
And Daryl Lane.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.720
How and when did science fiction begin?

00:47.320 --> 00:48.980
Well, that's a question with numerous answers.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.760
And one major problem in answering it is that science fiction has not always been a separate

00:52.760 --> 00:53.660
category of fiction.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.500
Its disengagement from so-called mainstream literature is fairly recent.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.160
Writer Elle Sprague De Camp has some thoughts on the subject.

01:01.160 --> 01:07.980
You have to remember that at one time, imaginative fiction, that is science fiction and fantasy,

01:08.120 --> 01:09.320
was the mainstream.

01:10.200 --> 01:18.740
Prior to, I think it was about the year 1719, when Defoe published Robinson Crusoe, there

01:18.740 --> 01:23.360
was practically speaking no such thing as realistic fiction.

01:24.140 --> 01:29.180
One or two scattered exceptions, but like the first one was Don Quixote.

01:30.160 --> 01:36.240
But by and large, practically all fiction had elements that we should recognize today

01:36.240 --> 01:37.540
as science fiction or fantasy.

01:37.760 --> 01:45.940
That is to say ghosts and miracles and marvelous gadgets of one kind or another.

01:45.940 --> 01:53.280
Why the Odyssey is a science fiction and fantasy saga right there with the witch, Cersei turning

01:53.280 --> 02:00.080
people into pigs and the monsters, Cilla and Corridus eating ships and so on.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.940
The transformation of imaginative literature into what we recognize today as science fiction

02:05.940 --> 02:10.620
occurred in the early part of this century, mostly in the pulp magazines such as Hugo

02:10.620 --> 02:12.320
Gernsback's Amazing Stories.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.980
Jack Williamson, who wrote for Gernsback, recalls that there was no term science fiction

02:16.980 --> 02:18.880
when Amazing Stories began in the 20s.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.780
When I started, my first story was printed as science fiction.

02:24.380 --> 02:27.640
Hugo Gernsback ran the word science and fiction together.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.540
He invited the term science fiction in 29, I think.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.500
And at that time, you had to explain what it was.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.540
I used to say it was adventure stories with a science background.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.420
This science background was of importance to Gernsback, yet he still wanted stories with

02:45.420 --> 02:46.620
excitement and adventure.

02:47.700 --> 02:55.520
He preached a gospel that science fiction was sugar-coated science, that it was education,

02:56.160 --> 03:04.340
and he got a whole panel of experts with degrees that were supposed to vet the science and

03:04.860 --> 03:07.760
science wonder stories when he started that.

03:07.760 --> 03:16.300
But actually, I think that was as much for him to impress the readers as anything else,

03:16.300 --> 03:24.820
because he did use true science in his stories when he could get it, but he also printed

03:24.820 --> 03:26.760
a lot of stories that were pretty wild.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.360
I think always in the magazine, the adventure element was more important than the science.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.920
At first, professional writers didn't contribute much science fiction to the pulps.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.060
The field was new, its readership was uncertain, and the rates were low.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.680
In the beginning, they were...

03:45.680 --> 03:51.720
Amazing was filled up with reprints of classic science fiction, and the rates were so low

03:51.720 --> 03:55.440
that professional writers didn't write for them so that when they wrote new stories,

03:55.600 --> 03:58.280
they were mostly written by amateurs such as myself.

03:59.140 --> 04:03.860
The classic science fiction Williamson mentions was worked by authors who were immensely popular

04:03.860 --> 04:10.080
around the turn of the century and a bit earlier, such as Jules Verne, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and H.G. Wells.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.140
But the new writers did come in a field that has yet had no definition or shape.

04:15.700 --> 04:20.060
These new authors created the styles and themes that are the foundation of today's science fiction.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.960
And most of them, as Williamson recalls, started out in John Campbell's astounding stories.

04:25.960 --> 04:31.320
They all started in Campbell's magazine astounding.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.720
He was, well, I don't know whether you'd say...

04:34.720 --> 04:43.980
Campbell discovered them or they discovered him, but it was, let's say, a small group with a great deal of,

04:43.980 --> 04:50.520
well, fellowship or fellow understanding and so forth.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.860
And it was an exciting period and wished to be alive.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:07.400 --> 05:10.600
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:55.380 --> 05:59.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.460 --> 06:21.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.020
And here are your hosts.

06:30.740 --> 06:31.880
This is David Carson.

06:32.240 --> 06:32.920
And Daryl Lane.

06:33.400 --> 06:38.560
What we today call Science Fiction took shape in the pages of the colorful pulp magazines of the 1920s and 30s.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.520
Jack Williamson, who wrote for those pulp magazines, is a living history of science fiction.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.400
His career as a writer goes back to the 1920s, before the term science fiction was even created.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.880
He grew up in the early part of this century on the frontier plains of New Mexico.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.500
Not long after he discovered the fresh and exciting new world of science fiction,

06:54.500 --> 06:59.840
he began selling his work to Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories, which was the first science fiction publication.

07:00.340 --> 07:07.300
I grew up on a sand hill farm in the south part of this county when times were pretty grim.

07:10.600 --> 07:18.160
I wanted to be some sort of scientist without any direction or means to get a scientific education.

07:18.160 --> 07:25.960
A few months after Gernsback started, the old Amazing, I came across some copies of it.

07:25.960 --> 07:35.080
And I was immediately fascinated with experiments that worked with travel and time and spaceships to other worlds.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.100
All sorts of wonderful things.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.280
It's been an important share of my life ever since.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.900
The pay scale for early science fiction writers was minimal.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.580
There were no movie rides or paperback contracts.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.040
Yet Williamson was able to produce enough fiction to make a living at it.

07:53.000 --> 08:02.600
Gernsback paid a half a cent of a word or less, which meant, well, you get $25 for a short story and $75 for a novelette.

08:03.340 --> 08:12.880
But Clayton paid two cents a word and up, which is one reason maybe that the Clayton magazines went bankrupt in the Great Depression.

08:12.880 --> 08:28.020
But that meant that I could pound out 4,000 words a day for two days and earn 160 bucks, which was a fabulous feat for a farm kid in depression days.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.800
Amazing Stories was a pulp magazine.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.740
A pulp was printed on cheap paper.

08:39.740 --> 08:45.920
There were usually large format magazines with lurid and colorful illustrations on the cover to catch the attention of prospective readers.

08:46.500 --> 08:56.360
In those days, before the paperbacks and before TV and before the comics, my people read a lot more for entertainment than they do nowadays.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.320
And there were really three sorts of magazines.

08:59.320 --> 09:07.440
There were quality magazines like Harper's and the old Scribner's, Atlantic for people with brains and the slicks,

09:08.000 --> 09:14.060
printed on coated paper that would take good advertising for people with money to spend.

09:14.420 --> 09:18.240
And the pulps for people who had neither brains nor money.

09:18.240 --> 09:24.560
But we had a lot of fun in the pulps even if we were looked down upon widely.

09:25.460 --> 09:34.100
And eventually, science fiction got recognized as being not entirely without brains, let's say.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.820
And nowadays, there's a little bit of money in it sometimes.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.560
A good deal of the early science fiction published in the pulps was space opera,

09:42.560 --> 09:50.240
a term which denotes a melodramatic form of science fiction characterized by heroes and villains, maidens in distress, and intergalactic warfare.

09:50.740 --> 09:56.780
Right, Buck Rogers type stuff. It's unsophisticated but Williamson admires it, and he points at it still around in the movies.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.140
I've never objected to space opera. I still think it's wonderful.

10:01.740 --> 10:08.280
And I even think that Star Wars could have been made out of my legend stories as well as it was from something else.

10:08.280 --> 10:14.020
I enjoyed Star Wars tremendously as a sort of adolescent daydream.

10:14.420 --> 10:21.680
And well, the pulp readers were mostly young and as naive as I was.

10:22.200 --> 10:28.640
And the space opera was a sort of symbolic escape from all sorts of things.

10:35.360 --> 10:43.320
Though it does still turn up now and then, space opera was left behind in science fiction along with Jack Williamson, moved ahead into its golden age.

10:50.160 --> 10:58.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:47.360 --> 12:52.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.960
And here are your hosts.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.760
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.840
In the late 1930s, science fiction was in transition.

13:06.840 --> 13:12.340
In one sense, it was becoming more sophisticated, outgrowing its early emphasis on space opera.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.940
Jack Williamson, who wrote Space Opera, considers this change natural.

13:16.980 --> 13:21.360
I was growing up and the readers were growing up.

13:22.040 --> 13:27.500
That's something that's been going on in science fiction, at least in American science fiction all along.

13:27.500 --> 13:45.660
I think you can draw a distinction between, let's say, European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand, which has always been recognized and treated as literature and part of American science fiction, which was looked down on.

13:46.000 --> 13:57.020
But as the readers of that grew older, some of them started writing, some of them started editing magazines, most of them outgrew science fiction, but some of them didn't.

13:57.020 --> 14:07.100
So there was a continual increase in the education, the sophistication and so forth, the whole field.

14:07.880 --> 14:15.240
Among these readers of pulp science fiction were a few who developed into those authors whose work defined what science fiction would become in later years.

14:15.800 --> 14:24.180
These early readers were people like Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, A.E. Van Vogt, Theodore Sturgeon, L. Sprague de Kemp, Frederick Poel and Hal Clement.

14:24.180 --> 14:31.600
And these authors are now the classics, those who wrote in that very special period of science fiction called the Golden Age.

14:32.520 --> 14:39.920
A.E. Van Vogt, looking back at that period, says that he read the authors who were starting out then with him, but that he had no idea they were doing anything special.

14:40.800 --> 14:55.040
Well, I read their stories, you know, I mean I was always fascinated by these various stories. I read every issue that came out, you know, so when you say what was it like, it just seemed like a perfectly natural thing that was happening.

14:55.780 --> 15:08.320
The notion that we were operating in a special period of time did not occur to me. You know, I mean we were just doing our thing and everybody was evidently stimulated in a special way.

15:08.320 --> 15:17.040
Frederick Poel belonged to a group of writers and fans in New York called the Futurians. He remembers the closeness of the group and how they would help each other.

15:17.900 --> 15:30.740
Well, science fiction has some special traits and one of them is that its readers herd together as much as they can. They form fan clubs and associations and correspond to groups and so on.

15:30.740 --> 15:42.640
And in New York City there were quite a few science fiction fans and about 25 or 30, most of whom wanted to be writers, formed a club called the Futurians.

15:43.400 --> 15:49.920
There were people like Cyril Karnbluth and Isaac Asimov and Damon Knight and myself, quite a few others.

15:50.580 --> 15:58.980
We did discuss each others work a lot and I guess in the process of criticizing it there was a lot of help given.

15:58.980 --> 16:13.020
I think the biggest factor that made it easier for a lot of us to go on with writing was just the knowledge that other people were doing it and also the fact that we collaborated a lot.

16:13.700 --> 16:28.860
We remitted each others deficiencies by writing, I mean by collaborating on single stories and although most of the stories were not very good, we did learn something by seeing how other people would tackle the same subjects we were writing about.

16:30.180 --> 16:39.500
Elsprague De Camp also remembers this closeness among writers at the beginning of the Golden Age, but like VanVote, De Camp says that the authors had no sense of participating in anything special.

16:40.240 --> 16:59.480
Well I daresay that various ones of us did have their greens and fancies at times and wondered how it was all going to come out and would this become, would the genre expand and take over the mainstream and various things of that sort.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.520
But as to that mostly, as I said, it was simply a matter of making a living.

17:06.520 --> 17:11.700
But the living those young writers made is the foundation of today's science fiction.

17:18.960 --> 17:27.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

18:11.020 --> 18:15.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:30.520 --> 18:35.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.120
And here are your hosts.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.060
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

18:48.820 --> 18:53.340
No individual has left his imprint on modern science fiction as deeply as John W. Campbell.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.920
And he didn't do it as a writer, though he did write good science fiction. He did it as an editor.

18:58.720 --> 19:04.760
Jack Williamson, who wrote for Campbell, speaks of the qualities that made Campbell the most important editor in the history of science fiction.

19:05.680 --> 19:27.200
I think he influenced the way nearly everybody wrote science fiction because when he became an editor of Amazing and later changed the name to Analog, he had the best high-span market in the field.

19:27.920 --> 19:39.300
Well, let's say science fiction was serious to him as a way of speculating about science and its impact on the future of mankind and so forth.

19:39.820 --> 19:46.180
He was tremendously inventive. He was full of ideas that he shared very freely.

19:46.180 --> 19:56.660
And then, everybody who was writing science fiction for those years was influenced by Campbell, it seems to me, whether directly or not.

19:56.780 --> 20:11.080
If they weren't trying to write for him and reading his letters, they were reading such writers as O. Heinlein and Dick Kamp and Sturgeon and a dozen others who were Campbell writers.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.780
From 1938 to 1950, Campbell edited astounding stories.

20:16.420 --> 20:21.120
1939, his second year as the head of the magazine, was a high point in the history of science fiction.

20:21.740 --> 20:30.080
It was in that year that Campbell published the first science fiction stories of Robert Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, A. E. Van Vogt, and Isaac Asimov.

20:30.780 --> 20:33.360
Williamson remembers reading their first works in astounding.

20:34.360 --> 20:39.700
They all started in Campbell's magazine astounding.

20:39.980 --> 20:58.920
He was, well, I don't know whether you'd say, Campbell discovered them or they discovered him, but it was, let's say, a small group with a great deal of well, fellowship or fellow understanding and so forth.

20:58.920 --> 21:03.240
It was an exciting period and wished to be alive.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.560
If you were a science fiction fan, it was an exciting period and wished to be alive, all right.

21:08.100 --> 21:15.620
And John Campbell was the right man at the right time, a leader who guided, pushed, and cajoled science fiction into the modern world.

21:16.140 --> 21:22.120
A. E. Van Vogt, one of science fiction's classic authors, recalls that he might not have ever written science fiction, if not for Campbell's encouragement.

21:23.260 --> 21:28.180
I had read science fiction when I was 14 in the early Amazing.

21:31.780 --> 21:41.880
However, it was, the Amazing stories was taken over from Hugo Gernsback by a man called T. O'Connor Sloan, or T. Connor O. Sloan or something like that.

21:42.720 --> 21:48.260
And he didn't know how to edit a magazine and after he'd been editing it for a few issues, I lost interest in.

21:49.260 --> 22:01.360
So I'd never read it again until 1938 when I picked up the issue of the astounding title in which Campbell's own story under a pseudonym was, Who Goes There?

22:02.300 --> 22:12.760
And when I read that story, I sent him a letter outlining an idea and he answered me.

22:12.760 --> 22:16.200
So if he hadn't answered, I may not have had a science fiction career.

22:16.780 --> 22:19.640
But I'd escalated, he answered all letters like that.

22:20.780 --> 22:25.200
In addition to encouraging authors, Campbell would help them locate story ideas.

22:25.620 --> 22:30.340
Frederick Poe, himself an important editor, says this was one of Campbell's greatest strengths as an editor.

22:31.200 --> 22:40.320
Quite a few stories come to be written because an editor says, listen, you've got a notion here that you are throwing away and you really should expand it.

22:40.320 --> 22:50.940
John Campbell was superb at that sort of thing. Some of the best stories he published were the result of his telling a writer that he had an idea that he didn't realize he had.

22:52.160 --> 22:58.940
John W. Campbell. Science fiction would be here even if he hadn't been, but it surely wouldn't be the same.

23:05.600 --> 23:14.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in

24:27.160 --> 24:28.900
Odessa, Texas.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.060
So stay with us.

25:02.400 --> 25:11.200
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Science fiction owes a debt to John W. Campbell. He brought it into the modern world and had a large hand in initiating its golden age.

25:11.620 --> 25:19.440
During his period as editor of Astounding Stories from 1938 to 1950, Campbell discovered and encouraged writers who are now classics in the field of science fiction.

25:19.960 --> 25:28.500
Author Jack Williamson says that Campbell's influence on an author was not heavy-handed or overly critical. He was even supportive of ideas he didn't agree with if they happened to be good ones.

25:29.580 --> 25:53.440
Campbell and I thought so much alike so that I always felt at home with his magazine and enjoyed working with him. And he gave me occasional very useful suggestions that I used and he never did, well, edit my material heavily or try to persuade me to say anything I didn't want to say.

25:53.440 --> 26:08.040
I believe that personally he was optimistic about science in the future, but when I wrote such a pessimistic, dystopian thing as with folded hands, he published it as it was and asked for more.

26:08.940 --> 26:16.320
Campbell influenced his authors in different ways. Elle sprayed a camp, for instance, remembers him as a teacher, but not as a source of original ideas.

26:16.320 --> 26:37.060
I learned a great deal of what I think I know about storytelling from him. One thing that did not occur between us was his proposing story ideas and having me write them because I've never been very good at turning other people's ideas into effective stories.

26:38.260 --> 26:54.620
So he may have tried it a few times, but when nothing came of it, why, he, I guess he quit. I can't think of one story that he proposed and I wrote the story, but then he rejected it.

26:54.620 --> 27:07.760
I finally sold it to one of his competitors. That was the Ghosts of Melvin Pie. He suggested a ghost story in which the dead man had had a split personality, so he had two ghosts.

27:08.880 --> 27:15.960
One thing that Campbell would insist on in stories he bought was scientific accuracy, a consistency with actual science and the laws of the universe.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.260
Author Howe Clement talks about Campbell's insistence on credibility.

27:20.000 --> 27:34.840
John was the one who bought my first several stories. I knew him quite well, talked to him quite often. Well, I didn't always agree with him. We both felt that there were rules and that they ought to be followed.

27:34.840 --> 27:52.880
We were both materialists, I guess. We felt that the universe does run by rule and we felt that a story was most believable when it matched those rules, at least as we meaning humanity in general, currently understood them.

27:53.560 --> 28:03.600
Campbell was involved in publishing Clement's science fiction novel, Mission of Gravity. Frederick Paul, who was Clement's agent at that time, tells an interesting story regarding the circumstances of its publication.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.560
Paul sent the novel to Campbell, who rejected it.

28:33.600 --> 28:51.560
I was 90 and drew a line under a paragraph there and counted up to a page 180 and drew a line under a paragraph there and had my secretary retype a couple of pages on each side of each line, saying at the bottom, the first part, end of part one, at the beginning of the second part, beginning of part two.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.580
And I let it sit for a couple weeks and I sent it back to John and he bought it.

28:57.620 --> 29:05.280
Mission of Gravity, of course, went on to become one of the classic science fiction novels. And Campbell is remembered as the greatest editor science fiction has ever had.

29:06.020 --> 29:13.340
It is not coincidental that his time at the head of Astounding Stories, 1938 to 1950, is now called the Golden Age of Science Fiction.

29:20.040 --> 29:29.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.120
Thank you.
