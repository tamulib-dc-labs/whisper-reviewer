coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

00:28.380 --> 00:34.320
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

00:37.000 --> 00:38.800
and here are your hosts

00:44.800 --> 00:54.260
this is bill vernon and david carson jones slonzewski is a young biochemist who
practices as a scientist and writes science fiction she brings into her writing

00:54.260 --> 01:03.520
another element from her life she is a practicing quaker slonzewski's first
novel bears the title still forms on foxfield we asked her to explain the origin

01:03.520 --> 01:14.500
of the title foxfield is the name of the planet that was named after the quaker
settled the planet and they named it after george fox who was the founder of the

01:14.500 --> 01:25.980
quaker religion still forms is a phrase that comes from a poem by whittier john
greenleaf whittier who was a quaker and he would he wrote a poem which described

01:25.980 --> 01:38.660
the experience of being in a quaker meeting and he spoke of the still forms on
either side that somehow breathed a special light and the still forms refers to

01:38.660 --> 01:48.560
the still forms of the people who were around him in the quaker meeting from the
title and packaging of this novel the prospective reader might assume it is

01:48.560 --> 01:57.660
strictly a soft science book on the contrary the novel has a good deal of hard
science woven in with good characterization slonzewski's aliens the commensals

01:57.660 --> 02:06.000
are well drawn they are sentient mobile plants that communicate by emitting and
detecting volatile chemicals we discover that slonzewski came up with these

02:06.000 --> 02:17.360
aliens while in the laboratory listen to her describe her thoughts in my
scientific work i've studied chemical communication among bacteria and it was

02:17.360 --> 02:28.460
sort of of interest to me supposing you could have an an alien intelligence that
would communicate chemically uh through through things like pheromones almost um

02:28.460 --> 02:41.580
how would this work would it be possible and i tried to think what kind of of
creatures these might be and and how they might work in different ways than our

02:41.580 --> 02:56.980
usual vertebrates mammals humans and so on and so it occurred to me they might
have developed from plants for for instance uh they they might use something

02:56.980 --> 03:06.880
akin to plant hormones before slonzewski could write still forms on foxfield she
had to find a way to incorporate these aliens with the quakers who were to be

03:06.880 --> 03:21.600
the human characters and i also was getting much interested in into into into
quakerism i guess at a slightly later date and the two things finally meshed

03:21.600 --> 03:33.360
together and that was really the key to to the book was when i was able to
combine those two ideas the idea of the aliens and the quakers and how they

03:33.360 --> 03:43.040
would interact and at that point that's when it became possible to move ahead
with the book it seems unbelievable at first that science and quakerism can mix

03:43.040 --> 03:56.520
so easily here slonzewski explains a bit about quakerism and how for her the
combination works the religion is basically christian it developed from um

03:56.520 --> 04:08.700
during the protestant reformation it was one of the protestant branches but at
the same time it has become very universal as it has developed and quakers today

04:08.700 --> 04:21.900
see a great affinity with other somewhat universalist religions such as buddhism
for example and i made that parallel in my book also and it is also a religion

04:21.900 --> 04:33.980
which scientists often find congenial because of the emphasis on the experience
of the individual in science you you test the universe by making experiments uh

04:33.980 --> 04:49.260
quakers test the spiritual universe by meditation and and an inward seeking of
truth an almost an inward type of experiment join us next time when we continue

04:49.260 --> 04:51.540
our talk with author joan slonzewski

04:58.660 --> 05:06.960
this has been the science fiction radio show production of the permian basin
science fiction association produced in conjunction with odessa college in

Thank you. Thank you.

08:06.540 --> 08:23.500
Thank you. a crisis, such as a death in the family, things like that. And in
science fiction, very often people are portrayed in the far future with the idea

08:23.500 --> 08:35.680
that simply religion has died out and there's no more need for it anymore.
Whereas I find that to be an unrealistic portrayal. It seems to me that there

08:35.680 --> 08:51.480
always will be people who will need religion, that it's a basic part of the
human experience and that science is never going to completely replace that for

08:51.480 --> 09:02.140
people. Slonczewski has read a great deal of science fiction. We asked her what
she watches out for when she reads a book featuring scientists at work. What I

09:02.140 --> 09:13.560
have my eye on really is the interaction between science and people. And that's
the one thing that I think is the sign of an outstanding writer, is the one who

09:13.560 --> 09:27.400
can really show how science operates in real life, not how we would like it to
operate in a fantasy life. I think Heinlein is, of course, the ideal example of

09:27.400 --> 09:45.060
that. In most of the good Heinlein stories, he will take a look at technology
and yet show the human perspectives on it and show how ordinary people's lives

09:45.060 --> 09:56.080
are affected. Since Slonczewski is a young writer just beginning her career, we
asked her what her advice is to aspiring writers. The most important thing in

09:56.080 --> 10:10.980
writing is to be distinctive. And by that I don't mean outrageous necessarily,
but to find whatever you have that is unique in your experience. And at every

10:10.980 --> 10:20.740
step of your writing, try to write something that hasn't been written before.
The second thing I would say is you just have to keep submitting what you write

10:20.740 --> 10:32.240
because... Now, I was very fortunate that the first publisher I sent my novel to
happened to have an editor who really liked the idea and was taken with it.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.760
That's an unusual thing.

10:36.320 --> 10:46.420
Agatha Christie took 11 tries to get her first book published. You know, and
there are all sorts of stories like that. So I would say those are the two main

10:46.420 --> 11:03.240
things. Try to be... To say the ordinary in a distinctive way. To write
originally. And whatever you write, just keep submitting it to publication. Joan

11:03.240 --> 11:07.440
Slonczewski, a young scientist with great promise as a science fiction writer.
