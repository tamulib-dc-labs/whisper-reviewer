This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.180
And here are your hosts.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.460
This is Daryl Lane.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.320
And David Carson.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.440
In addition to being an author, Daryl Carr is one of science fiction's premier editors.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.100
We asked him how he got hooked on science fiction back in the late 1940s.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.920
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

00:40.780 --> 00:45.620
Most people don't believe this story, but I actually discovered science fiction when I was wandering around a garbage dump.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.220
There was a garbage dump a few blocks from our house.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.720
And I liked it at that time when I was like, it's about 10 or 11 or something.

00:55.780 --> 00:59.580
Sometimes friends and I would just go down and look around to see what people were throwing out.

01:00.580 --> 01:06.900
And one day among things we found people had thrown out were a couple of old pulp magazines from the year before.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.500
Amazing stories.

01:10.100 --> 01:15.000
And I think there was one amazing story and one fantastic adventure, those being companion magazines.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.340
We grabbed those and brought them home.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.920
And I love them.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.840
I got hooked right there.

01:21.900 --> 01:27.100
After publishing a couple early novels and some short stories, Carr began his editing career at Ace Books.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.040
We asked him if he could tell us exactly what he did for Ace.

01:31.180 --> 01:44.560
Yeah, in 1964, I went to work for Ace Books as an editorial assistant, which actually meant that I was low man on the totem pole there.

01:44.560 --> 01:52.780
I was simply somebody who copy-added manuscripts, went over them to make sure the spelling was correct and things like that.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.260
There were no typographical errors.

01:55.660 --> 02:06.100
And then proofread the books before they actually got published to make sure once again that there were no typographical errors in the type setting.

02:06.880 --> 02:20.060
I would write blurbs, cover copy, kind of, you know, the things that are written on the front and back covers of paperback books to try to get you to be interested enough in the book to buy it.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.840
And at the same time, I was reading a number of submissions that were coming in.

02:27.020 --> 02:29.060
If I saw something good, I would pass it on to the editors.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.160
It was Donald Wollthine.

02:39.040 --> 02:45.660
Carr says he then began to make suggestions for improving and expanding the Ace Line of Science Fiction books, and he worked his way up in the company.

02:46.900 --> 02:54.060
Ace Books then did start doing a number of things that I had suggested so that I began getting this and that promotion.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.300
I think after about the first three years, I became a senior editor there.

03:01.320 --> 03:16.860
And began a series called the Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was very much a departure for Ace Books in particular, but for the entire field for that matter, because it was specifically designed to publish adult science fiction novels, not simply juvenile adventure,

03:17.860 --> 03:38.160
but serious novels using the science fiction genre as its format, and packaged uniformly so that people would be able to recognize a new book in the series when it came out, and packaged in such a way that, you know, it didn't have monsters chasing half-naked women on the covers.

03:38.160 --> 03:51.380
We had very good artwork by a team of artists called Leon Diane Dillon, who later won a Hugo Award and won two Caldecott Awards, and God knows what else they were extremely good artists.

03:52.840 --> 03:57.600
I also began anthologizing very early when I started there.

03:57.600 --> 04:15.100
Don Wolfheim and I were collaborating on an anthology, an annual anthology called World's Best Science Fiction, and I gradually branched out from that since I had begun to have my name on anthologies.

04:15.100 --> 04:27.740
I began to do all of this for Double Day and Fawcett Books and so on. And that was actually how I got my start doing anthologies, was the work that I was doing in Ace Books.

04:29.300 --> 04:39.820
Some of the anthologies Carr does include the annual universe series of original science fiction, which he originated in 1971, and the best science fiction of the year series, which he began in 1972.

04:39.820 --> 04:44.380
We'll talk to Terry Carr next time about what it's like to edit anthologies of science fiction.

04:51.640 --> 05:00.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:03.060 --> 06:08.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.920
And here are your hosts.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.480
This is David Carson.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.460
And Daryl Lane.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.860
Each year, Terry Carr edits two of the best known anthologies in science fiction.

06:23.320 --> 06:28.300
One is the universe series, begun in 1971, which is an anthology of original science fiction.

06:28.740 --> 06:35.220
We ask Carr the difference to an author between selling his story to a monthly science fiction magazine or selling it to an anthology like universe.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.480
There are all sorts of differences.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.680
They're both artistic and monetary differences.

06:44.420 --> 06:52.920
For one thing, if you sell to a magazine, then the money that you get from the magazine is simply the payment for that use of the story.

06:53.760 --> 06:59.300
If you sell it to an original anthology, that's going into a book, and you get an advance payment.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.140
But after that, you get a share of the royalties.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.120
If the book sells well, then there will be additional earnings on the book.

07:07.980 --> 07:14.980
And the individual authors will continue to make money for years thereafter, and indeed they do on universe, because it does sell pretty well.

07:16.140 --> 07:28.060
So your chances of making money on your story are at least as good, I would say, in the original anthologies as they are in the science fiction magazines.

07:28.940 --> 07:42.760
Aside from that, there's also the fact that a lot of writers simply like to have their work appear in book form, because they know it's going to be around to be read longer than a magazine will be.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.380
It'll stay in better shape, and it'll be in library or something like that.

07:55.480 --> 08:01.440
The Best Science Fiction of the Year, which Carr began in 1972 with Donald Walheim, is a different sort of anthology.

08:02.060 --> 08:05.420
It consists of stories published in science fiction magazines during the year.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.500
Carr reads all the magazines, then selects those stories he considers to be the best.

08:09.820 --> 08:14.040
But he says that there are certain problems that he has to solve when he actually starts putting the stories together.

08:14.760 --> 08:21.000
I do want to be sure that there aren't too many stories that are down-beat and depressing, because that's just not fun to read.

08:21.320 --> 08:30.800
There may be good stories individually, but you just string them all end to end, and they can actually seem not as good as they are.

08:31.700 --> 08:39.820
So I try to work on that kind of balance, and I try to mix up the balance between longer stories and shorter stories, because people do like variety in that.

08:39.820 --> 08:52.200
And if it should ever happen, for instance, but I think the best 15 stories of the year, however many it takes, are all time travel stories, for instance.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.560
I'm not going to publish a whole book full of time travel stories. That's just silly.

08:57.020 --> 09:03.580
Again, people would get tired of reading so many time travel stories in one book. So I try to mix up the themes, too.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.640
Carr explains the particular needs an anthology fulfills.

09:08.880 --> 09:17.580
As best I know, an anthology fills the need for people who want to read good science fiction short stories, novelettes, novellas, whatever.

09:18.480 --> 09:33.400
People who want to read something other than a novel. Probably people who want to have something that they can dip into from time to time, rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing straight through as they would a novel.

09:34.880 --> 09:45.820
There's a different psychology between reading novels and short stories, and most people do prefer to read novels. They always sell better than anthologies or single author short story collections.

09:47.800 --> 09:54.360
But there are people who like the short stories. I do, for instance. And there are the people who buy these.

09:56.240 --> 10:02.220
On a repaint anthology, the attraction, I think, is that these stories have been doubly screened.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.960
There are stories that were good enough in the first place to sell to the magazine.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.960
And then beyond that, there are the best stories from the magazine.

10:11.380 --> 10:19.580
So the people who pick up an anthology can reasonably expect that that is going to contain more good stories than the average issue of a science fiction magazine.

10:20.180 --> 10:28.000
This is always true. There's very bad anthologies and there's very good issues in the magazine. But by and large, that is the case, I think.

10:29.060 --> 10:33.480
Terry Carr also writes fine science fiction. Next time we'll talk to him about some of his own writing.

10:40.720 --> 10:50.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:03.480 --> 11:33.460
The story is about a young man who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist who is a scientist
who is a scientist who is a scientist who is

11:33.460 --> 11:34.220
in an

11:34.220 --> 11:36.920
The Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:53.240 --> 11:58.240
This is The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.600
And here are your hosts.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.040
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.140
Among the science fiction anthologies that Terry Carr has edited over the years are the so-called

12:13.140 --> 12:14.300
specialized anthologies.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.920
These would be volumes of short stories with a particular theme uniting them.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.560
For example, a book of short stories on robots or time travel.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.380
Carr has done many special anthologies. We spoke with him about a few of them.

12:25.660 --> 12:30.500
He explains the rationale behind his 1966 anthology, Science Fiction for People Who Hate

12:30.500 --> 12:31.280
Science Fiction.

12:32.460 --> 12:40.080
That was my first anthology that I did under my own name and nobody else's name.

12:41.180 --> 12:45.400
It was, I think, back in the second anthology I did right after the first world's best science

12:45.400 --> 12:45.760
fiction.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.980
And the idea on it was I wanted a book that could be given to people who don't normally

12:51.980 --> 12:54.300
read science fiction and think that they wouldn't like it.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.120
And I wanted, first, that the story should be good stories.

13:01.900 --> 13:06.840
And second, that the story should be accessible to people who don't know the specialized language

13:06.840 --> 13:07.680
of science fiction.

13:08.280 --> 13:13.760
There are a whole lot of assumptions that are just automatic in science fiction and nobody

13:13.760 --> 13:15.400
bothers to explain them anymore.

13:15.600 --> 13:20.400
So there are a lot of stories that are published these days that really require a certain amount

13:20.400 --> 13:23.060
of background in reading science fiction in order to understand them.

13:23.540 --> 13:28.280
I mean, nobody stops to explain what a Star Warp Drive is anymore because that gets a little

13:28.280 --> 13:29.440
bit tiresome after a while.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.440
We all know how a Star Warp Drive works, more or less.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.720
Or at least we think we do.

13:36.940 --> 13:41.640
But to somebody who's never heard of that before, that can be kind of confusing.

13:41.640 --> 13:57.720
Or the intricacies of the morality of robot behavior or the strangeness of time paradoxes.

13:58.140 --> 14:01.740
Things like that can be very confusing to someone first coming to science fiction.

14:02.440 --> 14:08.880
So the stories that I chose for that book were stories that had very simple dramatic ideas

14:08.880 --> 14:13.920
that were very easy to understand to someone who is not used to science fiction right away.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.340
But that were also very good stories.

14:17.440 --> 14:23.900
A more recent anthology is one carded for the Sierra Club entitled Dreams Edge, Science Fiction Stories About the Planet Earth.

14:24.400 --> 14:29.960
The origin of that was that the Sierra Club themselves decided they wanted to publish science fiction anthology.

14:30.820 --> 14:34.840
And they looked around for someone to do it and they eventually landed on me.

14:35.480 --> 14:44.840
The main problem I had with that book was that there were too many stories in it that were downbeat and depressing.

14:45.060 --> 14:54.840
If you start writing about the ecology of Earth, which is what the theme of that was, well everything's going wrong these days, as you know.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.460
And nobody really has any answers about what we could do about it.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.300
So even though I think all the stories in there are very good, there are only a few of them.

15:04.300 --> 15:13.880
And that hold out a whole lot of hope. Most of them are about the problems and the ironies of messing around with the environment and so on.

15:15.260 --> 15:19.060
In 1978, Carr put together an anthology many people consider his finest.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.240
It's called Classic Science Fiction, the first golden age.

15:22.820 --> 15:29.120
For this one, Carr chose stories from the years 1940 and 1942, a critical time in the development of modern science fiction.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.820
While Carr selected stories, he did something else that makes the volume of particular interest.

15:34.920 --> 15:42.980
But at the same time, I also did a lot of research on the writers, on the editors, publishing companies, the artists and so forth.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.980
The conditions under which they worked, how much money they were actually able to make.

15:47.960 --> 15:57.660
And I wrote a great deal of introductory material, background material about the writers and what they were doing, how they came to write each individual story.

15:57.660 --> 16:03.480
And I think the anthology itself contains a number of just classic stories.

16:03.900 --> 16:07.420
It's a basic anthology for anybody's science fiction library.

16:08.140 --> 16:11.320
But in addition to that, that background material is fascinating.

16:12.020 --> 16:16.200
It tells a whole lot of things about how things happen and why they happened.

16:16.520 --> 16:22.200
And it also tells a number of pretty amusing stories about things that went on behind the scenes.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.900
I really enjoyed doing the book.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.860
We'll have more with Terry Carr next time.

16:34.200 --> 16:42.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:52.080 --> 17:57.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.840
And here are your hosts.

18:06.220 --> 18:08.280
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.660
Editor and author Terry Carr has published three science fiction novels.

18:12.160 --> 18:18.980
The first two, Warlord of Core and Invasion from 2500, go back to the early 1960s and are pot boilers in the pulp tradition.

18:19.540 --> 18:25.140
But his most recent novel is a different thing entirely. It's a tightly constructed work with symbolic and allegorical depth.

18:25.500 --> 18:30.320
Entitled Cirque, it was published in 1977. Carr tells us where the idea for the book originated.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.960
Cirque is actually the Bay Area in some sense anyway, not literally.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.960
But the fact is that I live in the hills of Oakland in the East Bay.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.800
And there's a drive along the ridge of the hills.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.660
And I was up there one evening just that dust.

18:49.660 --> 19:01.180
And I thought when the light is such that the bay itself, which you can look down on, you'll see San Francisco and Marin County across the bay.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.720
And San Jose to the south and Berkeley and Oakland in front of you.

19:07.120 --> 19:13.540
And a lot of water in the middle, but at a particular time of the evening, that water simply turned black.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.600
And I was up there looking at that. And I thought, my God, you can't even tell at the bay it looks like a gigantic hole in the ground.

19:22.700 --> 19:28.940
And immediately I thought, what would a city be like to build around a gigantic shaft into the earth like that?

19:29.580 --> 19:37.960
And what effect might that kind of physical environment have on the psychology of those people who lived in that city?

19:45.120 --> 19:50.440
Carr explores the psychology and destiny of various inhabitants of the city's Cirque during unusual days of occurrences.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.100
On that day some monsters rise out of the abyss the city is built around.

19:54.740 --> 19:59.000
The monsters are huge and ominous, and the reaction of Carr's characters to them forms the basis of the book.

19:59.440 --> 20:04.100
Near the end of the novel, the monsters, after threatening the inhabitants of Cirque, turn into flowers.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.020
This episode, along with many others in the book, suggests a symbolic intent on Carr's part.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.600
We asked him if there was deliberate symbolism in the book.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.380
Oh yes, that is definitely deliberate.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.760
I knew the general outline of the story.

20:18.680 --> 20:25.920
I just didn't know the specifics of who was going to do what at which time and where they were going to be and so on.

20:26.820 --> 20:30.080
The symbolism is built into the whole concept of the story.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.700
And I tried not to make that show too much on the top.

20:35.700 --> 20:41.940
I wanted the surface to be a story that was interesting in and of itself.

20:42.760 --> 20:46.600
Because I don't believe that symbolism itself should ever try to carry a story.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.800
That war is made of tears.

20:48.740 --> 20:59.400
On the other hand, if you have a good story up front, and beneath that story is symbolism, preferably emotional symbolism, not just intellectual cuteness,

21:01.120 --> 21:03.520
I think that strengthens the story a good deal.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.280
Carr explains why I chose the title Cirque for the novel.

21:17.300 --> 21:24.180
Look, of course, is about a city which is built around a gigantic chasm into the ground.

21:25.820 --> 21:32.980
And so the city is named Cirque, which is French for Circle, and has other connotations too.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.860
It also, for instance, it's the French word for Circus.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.960
And it was kind of a circus.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.260
There were a whole lot of strange things going on at once in the book.

21:47.560 --> 21:51.280
And the construction of the book is circular.

21:52.300 --> 21:59.220
It starts at dawn on one day, and it goes ahead to finish at dawn the next day.

21:59.220 --> 22:06.200
And it finishes at the same place in the city where it began with the same characters there.

22:07.140 --> 22:12.600
So in all those ways, Cirque or Circle was the perfect title for the book.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.520
The only thing it really had going against it is that nobody knows how to pronounce it.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.800
We'll have more from Terry Carr next time.

22:28.140 --> 22:33.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:33.920 --> 22:36.840
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:45.800 --> 23:51.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.560
And here are your hosts.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.760
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.520
Science Fiction author Terry Carr is noted for his aliens.

24:05.300 --> 24:08.820
One of his better known creations is the mysterious millipede in the novel Cirque.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.300
But he's also written a number of short stories with fascinating aliens in them.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.780
The dance of the changer in the three is one of those stories.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
Carr provides an explanation of the premise behind the story.

24:17.680 --> 24:23.540
I had been reading of all people Roger Zalazny. We've seen him be mentioning him a lot here.

24:25.720 --> 24:32.860
And Roger at that time, this was in the late 60s, was working a lot with mythology in his science fiction.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.840
And I got interested in his work. I loved his work.

24:37.900 --> 24:41.140
And I was always interested in mythology itself.

24:43.000 --> 24:56.540
And it occurred to me that mythology tells a whole lot about the fears, the hopes, the beliefs of humanity.

24:57.420 --> 25:05.580
And that indeed, if any alien creature that ever came to this planet and wanted to find out something about what makes humanity tick,

25:05.720 --> 25:08.400
they could do far worse than to study some of our myths.

25:09.480 --> 25:14.660
And I suddenly just, there was a little click that goes on in your head and I turned that around and said,

25:14.760 --> 25:18.540
well, I like to think and write about aliens.

25:19.460 --> 25:26.080
And it's very difficult to write about an alien to me inside because I personally believe that aliens are inexplicable to us.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.240
We're never going to understand this fully.

25:29.800 --> 25:41.880
So I thought possibly a good way of dealing with the portrayal of an alien or an entire alien race would be to do it circuitously by telling an alien myth.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.800
And that is exactly what the dance of the changer in the three years, of course, is, an alien myth.

25:47.540 --> 25:51.440
And the myth itself is supposed to tell you a lot about the psychology of the race.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.080
We never do understand the psychology of the aliens in the story.

26:00.680 --> 26:06.620
The human narrator describes certain actions and some of the dialogue of the aliens, but the significance of all of this is never clear.

26:07.120 --> 26:14.160
The climax of the story occurs when the aliens, who are creatures of pure energy, inexplicably destroy almost all the humans on their planet.

26:14.520 --> 26:19.020
And they do it without malice, while they are performing one of the ritual dances that belong to their mythology.

26:19.020 --> 26:24.040
We ask our if there is perhaps some reason for this massacre, something we missed in reading the story.

26:49.020 --> 26:57.280
I would write something that made no sense, whatever, so that the myth itself, of course, is kind of a self-canceling myth.

26:58.260 --> 27:07.740
If you actually analyze it, there's a certain circularity to it. It has a dramatic coherence.

27:09.580 --> 27:19.400
But it's not a story that we would ever tell about ourselves that would resonate with the human psyche.

27:20.920 --> 27:31.640
And I wanted to end the story with something totally inexplicable happening, just to underscore and emphasize the fact that these creatures were aliens.

27:32.060 --> 27:39.400
And I wanted it to be something that none of us is going to understand, and that meant inevitably that I had to be sure I didn't understand it either.

27:40.540 --> 27:47.200
One of the points of the story then seems to be that humans could never understand an alien species. We asked our if this interpretation was correct.

27:48.200 --> 27:53.580
Yeah, that was the basic point. I've been trying to make that point in number of my stories.

27:53.580 --> 28:01.020
There's another one that I wrote earlier called Top Friends, which makes much the same point, but not quite as dramatically as that does.

28:02.420 --> 28:12.120
Carr's premise in the dance of the changer in the three is an interesting one, very different from the common science fiction notions of aliens as either hostile bug-eyed monsters or as creatures we can become close to.

28:19.060 --> 28:28.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:42.120 --> 28:58.520
Thanks for watching!
