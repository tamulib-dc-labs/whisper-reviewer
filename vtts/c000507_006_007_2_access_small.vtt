00:00.840 --> 00:04.080
which is just how much we miss film.

00:06.160 --> 00:19.460
And it's really, we also have a sense of discrepancy, too, I must say, but that's kind of something that I just want to acknowledge,

00:19.460 --> 00:35.300
because it underlies the whole conversation in some fashion, that the sense that it's still very recently for most of us that he died,

00:37.500 --> 00:55.080
and it's still kind of hard to believe that he's not around and that he can't just call him up or that he can't come to hear a Sachiko's concert or, you know, talk with me about these books coming out or anything else.

00:58.360 --> 01:15.220
And I think in fact a small group of his friends are going to be getting together this weekend, and I know in Orange County that Tim Powers has this gang that he describes in the, in VALS, still meets basically every Thursday night.

01:17.660 --> 01:31.260
And we all have a tremendous sense, as is, you know, in a sense kind of similar to what Angel expresses about her dead friend, so forth, in Timothy Archer.

01:32.400 --> 01:52.500
The loss and also the kind of power of that friendship and relationship and the way that the feeling of missing film just doesn't go away.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.140
Anyway, go ahead and talk about the benefit.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.700
Wow, okay, just go, the engineer wants to say something.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.060
We had the tape rolling during that, is that okay?

02:11.920 --> 02:12.780
Yeah, that's fine.

02:12.980 --> 02:13.840
Okay, fine.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.980
Just want, just want you to know.

02:16.340 --> 02:16.460
Yeah.

02:16.460 --> 02:22.240
No, that's, well, there's not much I can say.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.560
That's, that's all right.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.240
Okay, back to the real world.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.300
I understand that you named Divine Invasion Divine Invasion.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.820
What was his original name and then how come it was necessary to rename it?

02:40.820 --> 02:53.540
The original name is VALS Regained, VALS Regained, like Paradise Regained, which is a beautiful name.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.440
I like the name VALS Regained.

02:57.610 --> 03:07.680
It has certain problems from the publisher's point of view, which is that it was being published by different publishers than VALS.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.640
It has none of the same characters and it's not set in the same world really as VALS.

03:13.020 --> 03:29.700
It's not even the same kind of book so that anybody looking for another book like VALS, that was felt at the time, you know, would feel cheated by, you know, the title promising more VALS and then it being nothing like that.

03:29.700 --> 03:42.420
And I think there was also a concern that VALS was this strange book that maybe nobody would like and what's the best mark to tie the next book to success to people's reaction to VALS, which hasn't come out yet.

03:42.660 --> 03:47.580
Now as it turned out, VALS was a very big success quite unexpectedly even to the publisher.

03:48.420 --> 03:56.020
They thought they were going to sell 15,000 and they sold 85,000 immediately and it was like 150,000 at this point, which is very, very good.

03:56.020 --> 04:12.440
Anyway, funny call book VALS, 3Gain, that has none of the same characters, but on another level it's perfect because it is the sequel to the Paradise Lost, Paradise 3Gain, that's 2VALS.

04:12.940 --> 04:21.680
I happen to be in the editor's office when a letter came from Phil, kind of half-heartedly offering alternate titles.

04:23.680 --> 04:39.640
Most of them very silly and none of them that I could see anyway or I guess the editor could see that they had much chance of being a description of the book or in a pocket of title for the book but more like saying,

04:42.740 --> 04:46.760
alright, you know, like my beautiful title one, I should call it, you know, Clackets Pot Boiler or something.

04:50.300 --> 05:08.460
And so walking to Grand Central Station from David's office in Midtown Manhattan, I guess I thought about what would be a good title for the book.

05:10.280 --> 05:22.000
And suddenly hit on the idea of the Divine Fish as somehow sounding science-fiction and also being an accurate description of the main event that happens in the novel.

05:23.640 --> 05:38.420
And Phil didn't like the title at all at first. He ultimately came to love it, you know, a year later, virtually, and told me so.

05:38.420 --> 05:47.160
But that was how it came to be. I mean, I happen to propose a possible name that happened to get accepted.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.960
It was ironic though, stuff like this is always happening between me and Phil.

05:53.500 --> 06:01.520
And it always seemed to work out nicely, which is like the Role of the Self piece, which is...

06:02.460 --> 06:06.040
We're both really always glad that it worked out that way.

06:07.780 --> 06:15.700
You know that David Hartwell and I originally published Confessions of the Craft Artists back in 1975.

06:18.860 --> 06:25.420
Yeah, I'm a collector and I somehow missed out on that one. I had a chance to get it and for some reason I couldn't.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.660
And I've regretted it ever since because I haven't found another copy yet.

06:30.500 --> 06:36.640
Yeah, I guess there weren't that many of them. I'm really glad that it's now, you know, widely available.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.600
And again, that was a gratification to Phil to know that that was coming.

06:45.120 --> 06:51.360
And I have known a lot of people, I must say, who don't read science fiction, can't make head or tail science fiction,

06:51.360 --> 06:59.020
who have read Confessions and become very excited about Phil as a writer.

06:59.180 --> 07:03.340
You know they could read it because it's not science fiction. And then that would lead them into a set of quotes.

07:04.580 --> 07:12.880
So I think that Confessions and the trans migration coming out may help a lot to introduce new readers who aren't science fiction readers

07:12.880 --> 07:19.320
and, quote, have trouble with science fiction, you know, help introduce them to us.

07:19.320 --> 07:25.300
And I think that's where, just as of course, the Blade Runner, helps introduce people to Phil's work, however, back at Lee,

07:25.620 --> 07:29.980
because, you know, four or five, two thousand copies of Andrews have sold.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.020
I'll ask one more question about Divine Invasion. I kind of sense that it's getting a little bit lost because

07:40.020 --> 07:45.800
Vallas blew people away and then trans migration was his last book and it wasn't science fiction.

07:45.800 --> 07:55.500
And I don't hear a lot about Divine Invasion. And to me, it's almost an amalgamation, a perfect amalgamation of his old Phil Dick

07:55.500 --> 08:02.460
with the paranoia and his characters, the way he jumps between scenes, and then his newfound visions.

08:02.980 --> 08:08.980
And to me, I almost enjoyed it as much as anything else I've ever read by him.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.400
And I don't hear that much about it, either from critics or from friends either.

08:14.500 --> 08:22.280
Yeah. I know many people who feel as you do, who care about the book very, very deeply.

08:22.700 --> 08:27.860
And it's true that with some exceptions, there have been a few really wonderful reviews.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.720
It hasn't gotten the attention that it really deserves.

08:37.480 --> 08:47.920
But I suspect that will change over a period of time just because so many people have had the kind of powerful experience with the novel that you described.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.700
It's certainly a shame that it doesn't have a Hugo or Nebula nomination.

08:56.420 --> 09:06.120
But I don't think we'll get lost. I don't know yet, but I'm very hopeful that now that it's not paperback,

09:08.160 --> 09:13.540
with the continuing growth and interest in Phil's work, that it may be very popular.

09:14.980 --> 09:24.220
Again, it is some funny way of book that people who are not science fiction readers also can get into if they happen to follow across it.

09:27.180 --> 09:30.980
Okay. Now for the obvious question about Blade Runner.

09:31.720 --> 09:38.640
How did Android's Dream of Electric Sheep get picked up as a possible movie novel?

09:39.380 --> 09:45.080
I know how the name got changed, that sort of thing, but was it picked up a long time ago or was it recently discovered?

09:46.520 --> 09:51.500
It's a long, typical Hollywood story, which I know only pieces of.

09:54.280 --> 10:00.380
The Sky Herb Jaffee who's been around MGM and the movie world for quite a while, I think.

10:00.980 --> 10:05.500
I bought it at one point. I don't know that he was the first person to buy it, but he might have been.

10:07.220 --> 10:13.480
His son wrote a screenplay which was like a comedy. It was ridiculous.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.720
The guy came to visit Phil and Phil told him so.

10:20.260 --> 10:24.260
And this was back in, you know, 73, 74.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.740
But it was, Phil really wanted to see the movie made and it changed hands.

10:34.220 --> 10:49.000
There's a description by that fellow at Hanson Adventure or whatever his name is who co-wrote the screenplay who had the option for a while of how he got involved in it and ultimately sold it to Ridley Scott.

10:49.000 --> 11:03.840
So there's a description of that in an interview in Starlog, I think, in which sort of the authors of the screenplay answered what Phil Dick said about them in his interview on Starlog two months earlier,

11:04.020 --> 11:09.220
except that they have to deal with the embarrassing fact that the man they're talking about is just that.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.240
And it's a good time to spend their movie.

11:16.740 --> 11:32.680
But what happened in any event has to do with somebody owning an option and it got turned into this and it got turned into that and somebody else bought the that and bought, you know, the option along with it and the that was turned into several different doses.

11:32.680 --> 11:38.780
And it really, I'm sure, had zero to do with the novel androids for a while.

11:39.260 --> 11:48.120
And then in later stages, more of the premises and sort of the scene of Phil's novel were added back in.

11:49.500 --> 11:54.740
So that in my view, there's quite a bit of stuff in Playrunner.

11:56.480 --> 12:04.760
But it's by some long serendipitous process that has much more to do with Hollywood than him.

12:05.820 --> 12:10.580
And that as he said, you know, was very unexpected to him. He thought the movie absolutely awful.

12:13.020 --> 12:40.560
And finally, I concur. I feel pretty much as most of the people I've spoken to and any reviews I've read that the movie is a failure because of the, you know, is a failure in at least many senses because of the hopelessness of the script and the woodenness of the delivery and just the fact that they concentrated so on the scene that they threw away the script.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.960
And that's not just a story, but any story.

12:45.330 --> 13:09.840
And that there's no, you know, believability there. And it's a shame because the setting that they created is so fantastic that they could have had a very powerful and very, very successful movie there if they had just been a little more conscious of making stories that people could get into and that would work to happen

13:09.840 --> 13:24.480
within that setting. But I do want to see the movie again because Bill Dick wrote, you know, series of novels in the late 1960s, one of which is the do android stream of electric shape and this.

13:25.080 --> 13:44.040
And then there's the classic pothealer and you big three-stripped auto-phomeral trips that now wait for last year and others that all depict a sort of extraordinary burned out urban future in which let's face it, it's just very hard to get out of bed in the morning.

13:44.040 --> 14:13.580
And I have to deal with the fact that this is reality and which was always the kind of, you know, a description, a class of the contemporary world and a very brilliant one and that was uniquely filled with Dick and the scene that really has got created in Blade Runner with all the people who worked on the very special effects and so forth is very much that world that's setting.

14:14.600 --> 14:40.400
That's what's really created uniquely in the novels and when he saw, you know, a minute and a half of tapes from Blade Runner on a news program like that, more than a year ago, just sitting alone in his apartment one day he had this extraordinary epiphany of realizing that that was the inside of his brain, you know, there on the TV set that had been put into this movie and it was just an absolutely extraordinary thing that had happened.

14:40.400 --> 15:03.380
And even though it's frustrating that there's no damn story there and therefore there really isn't what you can call a good movie, the sad material, the portrayal of the background, the brilliant background of the film Dick World of the late 60s novels and certain of the situations, I mean Rachel is a perfect film Dick dark-haired girl.

15:04.260 --> 15:21.620
And visually and you know in certain other ways the personality and the appearance is precisely the dark-haired girl who shows up and we can build you and androids and you know many of others those novels.

15:21.620 --> 15:45.740
So again it's a extraordinary to go to this movie and see her there and it relates a lot to Bill's work. So it's just strange you know it's not a good movie and it's not satisfying and yet one can't help but feel fascinated by it and knows that it's somehow important.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.880
Did he ever see it or see most of it?

15:49.880 --> 16:02.960
He saw Rush's and he may have seen you know half a bit or more but I don't believe he ever saw a full film or you know even a full rough head as far as I know.

16:04.920 --> 16:11.080
Do you know if any other of his novels have been picked up somewhere along the line maybe a movie someday?

16:11.080 --> 16:26.800
Oh yes. There are two quite serious projects although you know Hollywood I don't know how serious they are this week as opposed to last week but two major projects that you know a lot of energy has gone into already and that are close to if not in production.

16:26.800 --> 16:55.780
By major studios one is called Claw and it's from the novelette second variety that goes way back to 1954 and appeared in a collection called The Variable Man and it's a typical film set up where these killing machines have been created and new generations of killing machines that are more effective that just go out and seek out you know

16:56.800 --> 17:20.420
killing flesh and cutting shreds and this future war you know has reached a point where to make things efficient the machines themselves turn out to be the next generation of machines and the machines start pretending to be people to entrap people you know as part of their hunting capabilities.

17:20.420 --> 17:47.140
So it's a classic film you know paranoid horror story and it's being made by Capitol Pictures into a movie called Claw and the other major project that's going on is I don't know much about but Disney is at least heavily into pre-production on something called Total Recall which is the 1960s short story we can remember it for you wholesale.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.540
Which appeared in many best of the air ontology so I think it's from fantasy and science fiction.

17:55.740 --> 18:12.700
Which I want to attempt to give a plot stop so I'll be a segment read it recently enough but I think it involves a kind of standard filmmaking situation of kind of going you know reliving your memories in an artificial way and trying to figure out what is which of these adventures are really happening.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.400
And there have been other books optioned at different times.

18:20.220 --> 18:33.940
Jean Pierre, Go-Ran had wanted to goddard movie making partner for years very earnestly wanted to do UBIT and Phil wrote a screenplay for UBIT but nothing ever came of it but I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see that come up again.

18:33.940 --> 19:00.960
I think that you'll see if we ever see some good nut movies made of Celtic's work there are lots of accounts from abroad and at one point there was French interest in doing confessions for craft artists and I think that would be extraordinary if that ever happened because he gets this French view of America in this novel about California in the 50s by a very American writer and it might be terrific.

19:01.680 --> 19:17.360
I don't think that Hollywood is likely to do anything more meaningful to Celtic's work than the you know very expensive very bizarre fascinating and you know makes the motion kind of thing that they've done in play.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.480
UBIT could make a hell of a movie I would think.

19:24.040 --> 19:34.780
I guess it was in your farewell to him in Locust where there's this apocryphal story that he turned down 400,000 to write a novelization.

19:35.360 --> 19:45.900
I applaud his doing that I think that's great but was he just in a financial position and felt a strong enough artistic sensibilities to turn that kind of money down?

19:45.900 --> 20:05.440
I mean he didn't have 400,000 dollars but he had more money than he needed because he was a very modest man and all he really needed to do was fit in his apartment and help his friends and study theology and sometimes write and that was really what he was into.

20:06.140 --> 20:18.700
You know I had a car and he didn't drive it so the principle really did matter to him a lot more and I'm not sure though that it would have been any different if he'd been starving.

20:19.080 --> 20:34.380
I mean he and it wasn't that he just totally turned it down out of hand it just he and his agent both agreed that it just wasn't right you know as the situation developed.

20:35.700 --> 20:41.200
The first situation to come about where his book androids couldn't be in print because that was what they wanted.

20:42.180 --> 20:58.340
The androids had to be suppressed so the playrunner could come out and it was also impossible for him to write really a novelization of any movie no matter how good and certainly a screenplay that he thought was awful.

20:59.500 --> 21:12.960
And it just developed into this situation where they were offering deals that they claim were worth 400,000 dollars literally pieces of this and shares in the marketing rights and so forth.

21:14.640 --> 21:25.900
And where he could just stand there and say no you know what's going to happen is that you're going to put out androids and I'm going to get 25,000 dollars and a lot of the royalty.

21:27.400 --> 21:33.600
And you're going to publish androids and that's it and ultimately of course that's what happened.

21:34.340 --> 21:38.900
But they were very angry with him at the studio and fought it for a long time.

21:41.840 --> 21:53.160
But it was just, I think for him it was a thrill and a privilege to get to make such a truly principled stand to such an outrageous degree.

21:54.700 --> 22:02.620
He always knew what was right and what was right for his work and he cared.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.920
Okay, two questions, maybe hard to answer, maybe easy to answer, okay.

22:14.640 --> 22:20.160
If he had lived a ripe old age what would he have done? Where would he have gone in his writing?

22:35.400 --> 22:46.560
If he had lived to a ripe old age I'm sure he would have kept writing and whatever he would have written would have been absolutely extraordinary.

22:47.120 --> 22:53.760
But indeed there's no possible way to guess what it might have been.

22:53.760 --> 22:57.680
I mean he was about to write a new novel.

22:58.740 --> 23:02.760
At the time that he died he'd been thinking about it for quite some time.

23:02.880 --> 23:07.540
He had a plot which probably would have been discarded and used as part of the basis for another one.

23:08.240 --> 23:12.720
And he had a title, The Owl in Daylight and he'd written it two pages.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.380
As far as I know that's probably it.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.680
And that book was extremely ambitious.

23:21.980 --> 23:23.400
What little I know about it.

23:28.360 --> 23:36.560
And the character would have been modeled partly after himself and partly after Beethoven's birthday.

23:37.820 --> 23:47.580
And it would have been a really challenging literary and imaginative and insincerational undertaking.

23:48.480 --> 23:58.000
And I think that his enthusiasm for his work at the time that he's been working on these last three or four books

23:58.000 --> 24:00.920
and the enthusiasm he continued to feel.

24:03.680 --> 24:17.020
Guarantees that the next novels to come along would have been as extraordinary and probably as different as The Divine Invasion,

24:17.440 --> 24:19.340
as Valence and Timothy Archer.

24:21.700 --> 24:37.240
But more than that there's no way for anyone to imagine that he would have taken his themes to the next logical stage.

24:38.240 --> 24:49.160
But operating under a logic that is his alone and that really died with him except that it lives in his many, many writings.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.640
Unpublished, nonfiction writings as well as fiction.

24:54.900 --> 25:04.180
There's still a logic that is unlike anything else in this universe but it could be remembered as a philosopher as much as a novelist.

25:06.180 --> 25:16.800
Based on what he's already done and based on a lot of material that's never been published and that would probably be too difficult for all but a handful of people to read.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.340
And he's still my piece, one of the most original and brilliant philosophers of the century.

25:23.160 --> 25:27.360
Is that how you think he would want to be remembered as a philosopher more than as a writer?

25:27.640 --> 25:27.900
No.

25:29.020 --> 25:33.940
I mean I think it might have been able to be remembered as that also.

25:35.200 --> 25:48.340
But no, certainly he was a novelist and a writer would be whatever that means would want to be remembered for that and for his work.

25:50.020 --> 26:00.200
But certainly it would be extraordinarily gratifying to him if people discovered some of the other levels of his work as well.

26:00.420 --> 26:11.160
I mean that is to say the among other things what's called the exegesis of which is the real and very earnest work which none of us have seen.

26:11.160 --> 26:29.760
I mean anything like all of and I haven't seen that much of and I think it's challenging going and yet it's totally passionate and intense brilliant far reaching exploration of the nature of the universe.

26:32.860 --> 26:37.880
Particularly from a philosophical theological point of view.

26:41.860 --> 26:48.240
And I rather hope that some of that material will certainly that will be available in my great sense.

26:49.220 --> 26:56.960
If it will someday be published in some form and I think that his letters to be published in letters are brilliant and incredibly funny.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.820
I mean he's just got an amazing gift.

27:00.930 --> 27:07.740
Funny as the Pistolary Writers ever and I think that that work will surface given time.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.620
Just because of his quality.

27:12.500 --> 27:17.760
Who has the power to or the ability to see that such things do come out eventually.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.920
The power rests with his estate.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.880
And his heirs one of his heirs is the administrator of the estate.

27:32.620 --> 27:34.800
And that's ultimately where the power lies.

27:34.800 --> 27:52.640
And I imagine you know that those agents would and should play an important role in suggesting what's best for his career as a writer.

27:54.060 --> 27:56.540
But we'll really have to see what develops there.

27:56.820 --> 28:03.200
I know there's a lot of interest in certain things and I feel confident that it will come about in time.

28:03.200 --> 28:09.100
But what how sooner what will happen next is very very hard to say.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.080
At least it is for me.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.200
I don't know.

28:17.660 --> 28:20.920
Thanks very much for spending the time with this.

28:21.680 --> 28:25.500
Not only the physical time but the emotional time.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.200
I'm sure this isn't a real easy thing to do even now.

28:30.200 --> 28:34.580
And we appreciate getting your insight into Bill Dick.

28:38.140 --> 28:46.300
It's a pleasure to know which I do know that there are so many people who really care about him and this work.

28:47.720 --> 28:52.560
Are fascinated by it to the degree that that I am.

28:56.200 --> 28:56.960
Great.

28:57.800 --> 29:06.340
It's I still say whenever something appears about him in the Wall Street Journal and times have changed.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.740
That's really something.

29:11.080 --> 29:11.300
Okay.

29:11.620 --> 29:15.480
I would love to see the change.
