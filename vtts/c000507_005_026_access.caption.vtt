00:01.060 --> 00:14.940
Well you sort of wanted to say something about the— When we first spoke of Jack
early on in there and I said that Jack had invited me over and this was in 1975

00:14.940 --> 00:26.440
and that there maybe it was their 76, and I came over and Jack signed some of
the books for us, we did a limited edition signed numbered edition and And Jack

00:26.440 --> 00:41.380
lives up in the hills there in the Bay Area. And his house, he's up on the side
of a hill, and a long, narrow, winding driveway goes up through the trees to his

00:41.380 --> 00:55.720
house. I went up and met him and got to know him after a little while. I've been
over there a number of times since then just to, I guess, just to visit more

00:55.720 --> 01:10.180
than anything else. And I've gotten to know him and his charming wife, Norma,
who is kind of one of the background or the basis of the whole thing that goes

01:10.180 --> 01:22.140
on over there. They're really a partnership, Jack and Norma, and their son,
John, who's 22 or 23 now. The three of them are a family unit, and they work

01:22.140 --> 01:26.080
together, and they're very close, the three of them.

01:29.020 --> 01:39.020
Jack's... For a fellow who's completely unknown within the field as far as in
terms of a personality, no one knows him, and he never goes anywhere.

01:42.000 --> 01:58.500
jack's really a social guy and has a number of parties and goes out quite a bit
and socializes quite a bit with really a wide variety of people and jack and

01:58.500 --> 02:03.500
norma and john and i and

02:06.460 --> 02:18.080
And got to be quite good friends. And our friendship was really not, it just
started with the book, I guess, and with publishing Jack. But that's just sort

02:18.080 --> 02:27.740
of a, it's almost an excuse for us to be together. And we spend a lot of time
together. And I'm not even sure what we talk about. A lot of what we talk about

02:27.740 --> 02:45.300
is illustration. Jack's a great lover of classical illustration, which is to say
of Beardsley and Kay Nielsen and Harry Clark and people who were illustrating at

02:45.300 --> 02:57.060
the turn of the century and the early 20th century. And I guess we spend a lot
of time talking about that and a lot of time just talking about anything but

02:57.060 --> 03:01.900
Jack's work, which we almost never discuss. It never comes up.

03:04.780 --> 03:16.720
And last year in Baltimore, Chuck came out here to Pennsylvania, where I am now.
I'm here visiting Chuck. And Jack came out and stayed with Chuck for a while.

03:17.320 --> 03:27.020
and they got to be good friends. They'd known each other only at a distance, and
they spent, actually the three of us spent some time together, or four of us, I

03:27.020 --> 03:40.840
should say. Norma was there, and somehow without Norm, Norma's sort of the key
to this whole thing in a way that I can't explain, but in

03:40.840 --> 03:55.100
any case, Chuck and Chuck's wife and myself and Mara and Jack and Norma just got
together and spent a lot of time together. It's an unusual thing when something

03:55.100 --> 04:05.500
like a book or I guess a work of art in a sense brings people together and forms
the basis of what later becomes very close friendship. Particularly in Jack's

04:05.500 --> 04:15.820
case because Jack never discusses his work and doesn't care to. Somehow once
he's finished a piece it's as if he's launched a ship and the ship goes and

04:15.820 --> 04:29.660
sails away and he's no longer a part of it and that's how he feels of course
anyone enjoys recognition in Jack should get more than he does but Jack's life

04:31.020 --> 04:40.740
has very little to do with literature except that he writes it he doesn't
associate with people who have to do with literature his friends are from all

04:40.740 --> 04:50.680
walks of life many of the musicians because jack himself is a musician and
enjoys music uh to a great extent you see that in his work you see it showing up

04:50.680 --> 04:53.620
in his books from time to time and

04:55.220 --> 05:11.420
that's most of what i wanted to say i just want to get a little of the personal
in there jack's uh uh uh I've been a good friend and uh uh he's been uh he's

05:11.420 --> 05:23.540
been an unusual fellow and he's he's been a it's an unusual kind of uh
communication in that and you if you enjoy Jack's works like I do uh would

05:23.540 --> 05:32.300
probably have the same sort of relationship or communication because it's with
an understanding it's with that understanding of life that that is the reason

05:32.300 --> 05:43.460
that you and i both enjoy Jack's work because he sees things a certain way and
reacts to things a certain way and just sees a certain colors or whatever in

05:43.460 --> 05:53.720
life around him and and uh it's it's uh interesting and a pleasure to
communicate with a person like that because you can speak of certain things that

05:53.720 --> 06:04.740
normally might never come up in your life. Otherwise, it may never come up in
your casual conversation with your friends or your business associates or

06:04.740 --> 06:17.480
whatever. Jack and Norma and I and Chuck all share that kind of communication.
It's sort of a rare thing and not really something that can be surrounded or

06:17.480 --> 06:27.360
defined by words. Okay, that's very good. They said, listen, as long as you
brought it up, can I shoot a couple more quick ones at you? Why not? When we

06:27.360 --> 06:36.540
spoke to him, I asked him a question about, essentially like what do you want to
be remembered for or what's your conception of your own work and so forth. And

06:36.540 --> 06:45.020
he replied in this way, and I think he was joking. He said, I want to be
remembered as a rich science fiction writer. How would you respond to his

06:45.020 --> 06:59.400
conception of his own work? Well, Jack, he's stepping into a role there to avoid
a question which I guess any writer might want to avoid. I don't know. I know

06:59.400 --> 07:10.320
Jack is offended by artists who take themselves too seriously. And that, as you
know, is a real problem with artists and writers today. Once they take

07:10.320 --> 07:22.780
themselves seriously, then they're finished, really. most of them are finished
as originators or as true artists and so Jack refuses to take himself seriously

07:22.780 --> 07:37.480
and does not act like an artist or talk like an artist or whatever as far as a
rich science fiction writer I don't know if Jack had wanted to have been rich he

07:37.480 --> 07:47.580
could have he did some work in Hollywood and he could have stayed down there or
he could have gone through the motions like a lot of other writers and appeared

07:47.580 --> 07:48.260
on the shows

07:51.240 --> 08:01.140
and publicized his own work and promoted his own work and he didn't do that and
that was by personal inclination and by choice so as far as what he wants to be

08:01.140 --> 08:14.900
remembered for Jack always says that he wants his work to stand for and by
itself and I think he just wants to be remembered for his work. He refuses to

08:14.900 --> 08:26.620
pick favorites among his work. I know he likes his Demon Prince series a lot for
good reason. He likes the Palace of Love, which is the third in that series. He

08:26.620 --> 08:41.340
likes The Eyes of the Overworld, the sequenced stories of the fellow Cugel. And
that's probably because Cugel's a rascal, and And Vance himself is a bit of a

08:41.340 --> 08:54.420
rascal, and Cugel's even more so. He's the kind of rascal that Vance would like
to be if he wasn't such a nice guy at heart. Would he mind if we put a quote

08:54.420 --> 09:09.400
like that on our show from you? Oh, not at all. Jack is no— There's no— In fact,
if I were to sit here and insult Jack and call the guy a lot of names he would

09:09.400 --> 09:25.820
probably enjoy hearing it on the radio simply as a practical joke those kind of
situations occur in Jack's book where one person who has helped us to defend

09:25.820 --> 09:44.620
himself or reply gets smeared in public or private I won't do that to Jack But
Jack certainly would not mind it. Okay listen, also I when I spoke with him near

09:44.620 --> 09:51.960
the end of the interview I was asking about his future work and so forth. And he
mentioned that book he just finished and what he might have planned. Just in

09:51.960 --> 10:04.380
your personal opinion, are there some more really good books that he is going to
be writing? I kind of got the impression he wondered if he still had it, if he

10:04.380 --> 10:14.580
could still write up to the standards he had set for himself. Well, every writer
feels that, particularly when they're not finished with the work. And Jack is

10:14.580 --> 10:29.740
finishing up this work, and he's this Lyonesse, this large fantasy work which
takes place on Earth. Lyonesse is kind of like Avalon. It's some kind of mythical

10:29.740 --> 10:43.060
island offshore of Britain somewhere, if you want to locate it. It's sometime in
the far past, and it's a magical place with elves and trolls and beings like

10:43.060 --> 10:43.420
that.

10:48.680 --> 10:59.240
Yeah, I think this is a major work, and I think there will be a few more. Jack's
writing fewer books, but he's going to write just a few large, major pieces now.

10:59.840 --> 11:08.360
He's kind of done fooling around. One of the reasons he's writing, he was
writing all these kind of unrelated books. And these books, they weren't short,

11:08.500 --> 11:22.780
but they certainly weren't long. But no one would pay him to do any differently.
And he was making money as a writer. And no one would, until Berkley, gave him

11:22.780 --> 11:33.500
a reasonable advance on the work that he's doing now, which allowed him to work
for a year or two on it, uninterrupted. I mean, there's economical reasons for

11:33.500 --> 11:45.160
this sort of thing. So he was, you know, he finally had the stature and found a
publisher that believed in him. Don Wollheim also has done a good deal for Jack.

11:45.380 --> 11:55.580
Put a lot of his books out. got them all back into print but Berkley will be
publishing this particular book and he's been able to do it so he's doing that

11:56.360 --> 12:06.400
Jack when he wrote the last two of the Demon Prince books felt the same he re
-read the first three and he thought you know God these are really good books

12:07.880 --> 12:17.600
and they are in fact astounding works of literature and he wondered if he was up
to snuff if he could still write like that And then he sat down and wrote two

12:17.600 --> 12:28.600
more. And they were very different than the first three, but they were as good.
And, in fact, some people liked them better. I guess it's a matter of

12:28.600 --> 12:40.500
preference, but I think what you heard was a writer just thinking to himself.
Okay, I can think... I read a little bit of the work that he's... the thing that

12:40.500 --> 12:44.380
he's working on now, and there's some tremendous stuff in there.

12:47.820 --> 12:55.740
Okay, I can think of one more. This is sort of a personal opinion question, too,
just between two Jack Vance fans. I suppose any writer has to put some of

12:55.740 --> 13:05.420
himself into his characters. You mentioned that maybe there's a little of Vance
in Cugel, for instance. In my reading of his work, I would say that maybe in the

13:05.420 --> 13:14.720
Durdane trilogy, the protagonist, Gastel Etzwane, of all the characters Vance
has written about, to me, that would seem closest to what I would conceive of

13:14.720 --> 13:28.920
him as being. How would you respond to that? Yeah, you've got it there, and also
there's a lot of Vance in Inferio in The Man and His Son, you know, because Jack

13:28.920 --> 13:40.220
and Norma are both very close to their son, John, and Inferio, in a sense, was
kind of written, I think, for John to read at some later date in his life. John

13:40.220 --> 13:47.300
the son John doesn't John doesn't read any of his father's books and I

13:48.320 --> 14:01.240
think Jack wrote that book for John and and I would say yes I'd say Durdane Jack
likes that series a lot they're really mature works yeah there's a lot of them

14:01.240 --> 14:14.040
in there because Jack as a musician and I just the musician going on to the
world and finding things out about himself and the world around him. But Cugel

14:14.040 --> 14:28.560
also. Jack's a bit of a rascal, and that part of him happens to be Cugel. Are
you going to do Durdane, by the way? Yeah. I'm looking forward to that one.

14:28.600 --> 14:38.100
That's probably my favorite. Yeah. Yeah, some people feel that way. People
really like that series. You're right when you said it was a mature work, I

14:38.100 --> 14:47.760
think that very subtle... Listen, our connection is kind of getting bad now
anyhow, and I think that's probably all the time we better... Just a second,

14:47.900 --> 14:56.580
David has... Oh, David wants to know if you're going to do the hardcover of
Lyonesse ever. Yeah, as a matter of fact we're planning to do that because

14:56.580 --> 15:04.280
Berkley is probably going to issue it as a trade paperback so if it works out,
yes we are going to do a hardcover addition of that. And so, theoretically,

15:04.460 --> 15:12.720
yours would be the first hardcover? Yeah, it'll be the first edition also if we
can precede them. Yeah. And it'll be a small edition probably. 700 copies,

15:12.860 --> 15:21.520
whatever. Yeah, we're going to stay on your mailing list then. Good. Listen, we
sure appreciate your time again. Thank you very much, Tim. Good. Okay. Yeah.

15:21.520 --> 15:28.660
Okay? If you have any other questions or whatever, just call me home or call
Chuck here. We might do that. Thank you. Yeah, very good. Take care. Bye. Bye.
