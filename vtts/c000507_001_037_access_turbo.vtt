Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

00:28.420 --> 00:33.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and fantasy,

00:36.400 --> 00:38.140
And here are your hosts.

00:43.340 --> 00:48.300
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Some of the most exciting science fiction being written today

00:48.300 --> 00:53.380
comes from the pen of Jack Chalker and it's clear that he's a popular writer too probably best known

00:53.380 --> 00:58.080
for the five books in the Well World series. In fact the first novel in that series Midnight at

00:58.080 --> 01:03.280
the Well of Souls has sold over a million copies. Chalker's first book came out not that long ago,

01:03.280 --> 01:08.960
1976, so his work is still fairly recent. He'd been active in the field though years before he started

01:08.960 --> 01:15.300
writing corresponding with authors and other fans, attending conventions, editing a fanzine, even

01:15.300 --> 01:20.520
starting a small publishing company Mirage Press to produce material on science fiction but Chalker

01:20.520 --> 01:26.240
says he'd always planned on being a writer. I'd always known I was going to be a writer. I mean

01:26.240 --> 01:30.840
there just was never any question in my mind but it was just sort of something that you never really

01:30.840 --> 01:37.080
sat down and did. I used to play around with stories here and there. Uh John Campbell was a big help

01:38.560 --> 01:44.220
uh during the 60s. I would float ideas and fragments off him and he would be very very nice

01:44.860 --> 01:51.560
and tell me exactly what was wrong. Of course what infuriated everybody about John Campbell uh was that

01:51.560 --> 01:57.120
uh the man had been editing for 40 years and he could put his finger on something and tell you exactly

01:57.120 --> 02:02.980
what you were doing wrong and it was terribly infuriating to discover that he was right in almost every case.

02:03.560 --> 02:14.180
Uh you saw why he did it from 39 until he died and uh as a result of being able to have the help of people

02:14.180 --> 02:20.280
like Campbell and August Derleth and a lot of really established writers and editors in the field,

02:20.280 --> 02:26.560
uh i was able to get a good recognition of exactly what was required in the field.

02:27.280 --> 02:33.560
Uh it just was a matter of sitting down and doing it. Fortunately he did sit down and do it

02:33.560 --> 02:44.440
publishing Jungle of Stars in 1976. So I sat on a typewriter and there was really no question in my mind as to

02:44.440 --> 02:53.020
uh what I do first. I had been playing around with an idea for years and years and years. There's even

02:53.020 --> 03:02.020
a short fanzine version of it 20 years old uh called Jungle or Jungle of Stars or uh there were a lot of

03:02.020 --> 03:11.400
code words but Jungle was always in it. And um I sat down and wrote the thing. I wrote. It had been around so

03:11.400 --> 03:19.000
long in my mind and discussions and so on that, there was just no problems no resistance no having to

03:19.000 --> 03:24.520
think it out or anything else. And I wrote it solidly in about two and a half three weeks

03:26.200 --> 03:37.260
and then sent it off. And it's a good old-fashioned type. It's a science fiction murder mystery

03:37.260 --> 03:44.280
uh very much very much very much at home in the old uh Astounding, Analogs and so on even though it

03:44.280 --> 03:46.780
does have some modern touches to it.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.400
Some of his earlier contacts with people in the field of science fiction paid off

03:56.400 --> 04:04.760
one of them Judy Lindal Ray bought the novel. Judy Lindal Ray uh who had just become editor of

04:04.760 --> 04:10.600
uh Ballantine, which was soon to have a science fiction line named after her,

04:12.360 --> 04:19.600
uh took a look at it we'd known each other for about 15 years. And uh she put off reading it for

04:19.600 --> 04:25.960
quite a long time because she was afraid that if it was terrible and she said so that you know she'd

04:25.960 --> 04:33.080
blow our friendship or something. Finally she said uh uh i we got together at a convention and she admitted

04:33.080 --> 04:38.220
to me all this she said okay I'll read it but be prepared and about four days later I get a phone

04:38.220 --> 04:44.240
call and she said hey this is great I want to buy it and that was the first sale.

04:45.980 --> 04:51.600
Since then Chalker has published some 13 novels and he's still going strong. More with Jack Chalker next

04:51.600 --> 04:51.980
time.

04:58.980 --> 05:03.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:03.840 --> 05:08.000
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:08.000 --> 05:28.100


05:28.100 --> 05:28.320


05:28.320 --> 05:30.840


05:55.680 --> 06:00.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.000 --> 06:30.000
This is the Science Ficiton Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.
And here are your hosts. This is David Crews and Daryl Lane.

06:32.680 --> 06:39.320
A hike through a national park and a war game board, unlikely sources for a tremendously popular science fiction novel.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.180
The novel is Midnight at the Well of Souls. The author is Jack Chalker.

06:43.340 --> 06:48.200
The book concerns the Well World, an artificial planet constructed by a vanished civilization.

06:48.500 --> 06:54.660
The Well World is divided into 1,560 separate environments. Separate worlds, really. Each

06:54.660 --> 06:57.260
with its own climate, geography, and intelligent inhabitants.

06:57.770 --> 07:01.600
Each division is shaped like a hexagon, and for that reason they're called hexes.

07:02.380 --> 07:07.000
Chalker was in an isolated village called Stehekin, on the shore of Lake Chelan in central Washington

07:07.000 --> 07:09.160
state, when he got the idea for the Well World.

07:10.680 --> 07:17.400
I got to sitting by the lake that night and talking with some people, and I got the idea

07:20.300 --> 07:27.220
for this large world built by a long dead race, and so on, and I didn't really have much of

07:27.220 --> 07:34.160
an idea of what it was, and they do have a service out of Stehekin that'll take you up to Trailhead.

07:35.300 --> 07:41.220
And so I went up to Trailhead, and I wound up walking down. I'm a great hiker as long as the

07:41.220 --> 07:47.140
direction's down. I'm afraid I've never been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon because I can get

07:47.140 --> 07:53.300
down there, but I can't get back up. But here was a trail that was tailor-made for me. It was down the

07:53.300 --> 08:04.160
Cascades all the way. So I took it, and it took about eight and a half hours to walk the whole distance.

08:06.800 --> 08:13.380
And during that time, you go through eight climate zones. You start off in the snow. You wind up in a

08:13.380 --> 08:20.320
rainforest. And some of the changes are rather abrupt. You just go around a switchback, and it

08:20.320 --> 08:26.780
just changes from one climate to another, each with its own different plants and insects and

08:27.360 --> 08:32.520
occasional mammals. Even the birds seem to be different. And I thought, yeah, this is how that

08:32.520 --> 08:39.100
big world would be like. So even though while I was on my way down, I was kind of scribbling ideas.

08:41.160 --> 08:50.040
And I got the idea for this giant world composed of basically worldlets, different abrupt geography,

08:50.300 --> 08:59.400
climate, landforms, you name it, each with its own dominant race. By the time I hit bottom, I had it

08:59.400 --> 09:04.420
pretty well worked out, although I didn't really know what the shape of the things were going to be.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.000
Back home in Maryland, he got some help on the shape of the well world.

09:10.240 --> 09:16.460
I was discussing the idea with a science fiction fan named Ben Yalow, son of the Nobel winner,

09:17.960 --> 09:22.740
Rosalyn Yalow. And he says, why don't you just use an Avalon Hill game board?

09:24.220 --> 09:32.760
And I thought, yeah, that would work. So we got out an Avalon Hill map, a war game map, and a little

09:32.760 --> 09:40.280
trusty calculator. We laid a grid of these hexagons around a roughly Earth-sized world.

09:40.860 --> 09:46.640
Of course, we cannot cover a sphere with hexagons. So that means we had the north zone and the south

09:46.640 --> 09:54.960
zone, which would be the embassy's entry and exit points that would cover our sphere. And then it was

09:54.960 --> 10:03.020
just simply a matter of sitting down, listing what was required to do, what kind of creatures and land

10:03.660 --> 10:10.440
climate and so on I would have to do for the route of the story, dropping by Avalon Hill, which I lived

10:10.440 --> 10:16.380
very near at the time, picking up some blank maps, and just working it out from there.

10:17.780 --> 10:22.300
What Chalker worked out turned into his best-known novel, Midnight at the Well of Souls.

10:22.300 --> 10:26.740
It was so popular that it went out of print a few months after its initial press run.

10:26.920 --> 10:31.100
And Chalker has added four novels since then, making a five-book series in the Well World.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.700
The whole thing turned out to be a colorful and exciting epic on the origin of the universe

10:35.700 --> 10:39.940
and all of the creatures in it. It should fascinate any reader of science fiction.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.960
More on Jack Chalker next time.

10:49.460 --> 10:54.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:54.280 --> 10:58.160
Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:22.500 --> 11:27.440


11:47.520 --> 11:51.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.640
Science Fiction Radio Show.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.760
This is Daryl Lane.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.760
And David Crews.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.060
The five novels in Jack Chalker's Well World series are based on a familiar science fiction

12:28.060 --> 12:28.580
concept.

12:28.980 --> 12:33.920
And that concept is the notion of a long-dead race of superior beings whose artifacts are

12:33.920 --> 12:34.780
found by humans.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.980
But there are a couple of interesting twists given to this concept by Chalker.

12:39.320 --> 12:44.700
One twist is the principal artifact by the vanished race. It's a planet called the Well World.

12:44.700 --> 12:51.060
It's artificial. And its interior is a supercomputer that can transform matter into all sorts of living creatures.

12:51.400 --> 12:58.080
It's really a laboratory planet where species are created and tested before being transferred to various places throughout the universe.

12:58.080 --> 13:03.640
And the other twist is that these superior beings, called the Markovians, aren't actually gone.

13:03.940 --> 13:07.060
They just transform themselves into other, more primitive beings.

13:07.060 --> 13:09.360
Chalker talks about the Markovians.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.820
They got to the point where they were gods, literally.

13:14.040 --> 13:19.340
Where their devices could conjure up anything they wanted, just the mere thought of it.

13:21.080 --> 13:27.780
I sense that it pointed out to me that they're sort of like the Krell in the old movie Forbidden Planet,

13:28.360 --> 13:30.760
in that they reach this godhead status.

13:31.120 --> 13:37.000
But the Krell experiment failed, because they couldn't control their passions.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.460
And the Markovian experiment succeeded, and they literally became gods.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.160
Then they became miserable.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.620
There was nothing left to attain.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.480
There was nothing left to know.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.720
There was nothing left, you know.

13:49.280 --> 13:55.240
You got a bunch of creatures that spent millions of years rising to this point,

13:55.340 --> 13:57.060
and they sit around and they say, is this all there is?

13:58.340 --> 14:01.460
At this point, the Markovians decided to start all over again.

14:02.480 --> 14:08.600
The idea of the great experiment that came about was to redo it,

14:08.860 --> 14:12.480
to literally start the Markovians over from scratch,

14:13.260 --> 14:16.500
with different kinds of creatures, different environments,

14:18.660 --> 14:20.800
with no real value system.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.360
I mean, they have to develop their own unique value systems.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.580
They do.

14:25.520 --> 14:31.940
And as a result, they're grown and they're tested on this laboratory world, the well world.

14:32.260 --> 14:37.180
And then they were the ones that worked, the ones that showed promise of survival,

14:37.200 --> 14:43.360
were then set into motion out throughout the universe, including man.

14:45.620 --> 14:58.500
And they had the hopes that eventually one of these races would reach a state of perfection that would not be empty or hollow.

14:58.500 --> 15:05.480
Now, I personally believe that when you reach that state, it is empty and hollow.

15:06.220 --> 15:11.900
But that's just my feeling.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.620
Other people might certainly do think differently.

15:16.100 --> 15:21.500
The Markovians create hundreds of different species, all intelligent, but all incredibly different.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.460
We asked Chalker how he gets ideas for creating such a variety of aliens.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.860
I used a variety of things.

15:28.980 --> 15:35.580
In some cases, a good pictorial natural history text will give you more weird creatures than you've ever seen,

15:37.120 --> 15:38.660
which can be modified.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.900
Some came out of mythology.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.880
Some came more or less direct out of fantasia, sorts of like that.

15:49.820 --> 15:54.080
And a few came out of comic book concepts.

15:54.600 --> 16:00.740
And, you know, you just draw them in from all over and you use basic shapes and basic types.

16:01.120 --> 16:09.040
And then you adjust them to what would happen if these were real, sentient, intelligent creatures.

16:10.620 --> 16:17.340
I found very, very little trouble in coming up with an enormous variety of them.

16:17.940 --> 16:23.920
I'm not sure whether I could come up with 1,560, which is the number I would have to to visit every hex in the well world.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.440
But I've had no trouble coming up with the 200 or 300 so far.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.060
More with Jack Chalker next time.

16:37.580 --> 16:43.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:43.040 --> 16:46.280
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.260


17:41.780 --> 17:45.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:01.620 --> 18:07.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.460
And here are your hosts.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.480
This is Daryl Lane.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.480
And David Crews.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.080
Before you became a best-selling science fiction author,

18:21.400 --> 18:26.000
Jack Chalker was an avid fan who built an amateur fanzine into a science fiction publishing company.

18:26.400 --> 18:31.220
Chalker started the fanzine in his early teens as a way of making contacts in the field of science fiction

18:31.220 --> 18:33.940
and with the possibility of making a little money at it.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.320
That basically was the reason.

18:37.500 --> 18:44.600
We started with a fanzine, which was run off actually at a school at the beginning because we didn't have anything else.

18:46.860 --> 18:52.200
And he'd got some reasonably good reactions, so I started building up from there.

18:52.200 --> 19:02.720
While I was doing that, actually, I had correspondence already with enormous numbers of people, both professional and fan.

19:03.600 --> 19:10.300
I had so much correspondence, I can't believe how many people I was contacting on a regular basis.

19:10.300 --> 19:15.920
And so I started tapping them and created the fanzine Mirage.

19:16.580 --> 19:26.020
The addition of a $40 surplus mimeograph found in an old store, which I still own, by the way, and which still works,

19:27.860 --> 19:31.620
I was able to start putting out a fanzine called Mirage.

19:32.860 --> 19:38.860
The fanzine was successful because of its high quality, and it led into a small publishing company, Mirage Press.

19:40.500 --> 19:46.620
I was serious and constructive at the same time that everybody else was being just sort of kid hobbyist.

19:47.300 --> 19:54.680
I really had a magazine that discussed the literature, discussed the writers and so on, past and present,

19:54.920 --> 19:57.560
at a time when very few of these were coming out.

19:57.560 --> 20:04.360
And so I attracted a rather large audience of collectors and professional writers and artists and so on.

20:04.740 --> 20:14.380
And I was able to create out of that the Mirage Press, which started off again as mimeographed publications

20:14.380 --> 20:22.880
and then later grew as capital grew into a hardcover and quality paperback publishing account.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.300
Chalker says that Mirage Press was successful from the start.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.820
I started off with a bibliography of H.P. Lovecraft, which I did myself.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.880
Put it together, mimeographed it with the help of August Derleth,

20:41.300 --> 20:45.520
who owned the rights to the H.P. Lovecraft material at the time,

20:46.600 --> 20:55.840
and sold it for what in 1960 was a horrendous fee of $1,

20:57.160 --> 20:58.640
and we sold 100 of them.

21:00.460 --> 21:05.540
Mirage Press publishes non-fiction materials such as bibliographies and critical studies of authors.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.700
Chalker leaves the publishing of fiction to the large companies.

21:09.740 --> 21:16.060
You can't compete with Doubleday, Simon & Schuster, and so on for the good stuff in fiction.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.920
And although I did do a little bit of fiction,

21:21.600 --> 21:27.960
getting into print some books of work that I thought was very, very neglected,

21:28.820 --> 21:30.660
you really have to promote fiction.

21:31.820 --> 21:37.900
Whereas non-fiction and reference material is always, there's always a heavy market,

21:38.040 --> 21:39.460
and there's been a growing market for it.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.220
And so I concentrated in that end.

21:43.020 --> 21:46.100
And we came up with some rather successful books,

21:46.200 --> 21:50.640
Guide to Middle Earth, which in its Ballantine form, which I still own a piece of,

21:50.640 --> 21:53.800
is still selling well in Atlas of Fantasy.

21:57.060 --> 22:02.220
We did three books on sword and sorcery fiction before the comic books discovered Conan.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.960
And occasionally we did rather odd materials,

22:08.180 --> 22:14.080
such as a collection of all of the Ferdinand Feghoot bad puns

22:14.920 --> 22:17.500
that had been published over the years, this kind of thing.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.120
Mostly, though, we were serious reference works,

22:22.160 --> 22:23.800
and we still have a number of them that are standard.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.400
Next time, more with Jack Chalker.

22:35.540 --> 22:38.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:38.280 --> 22:41.040
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:41.320 --> 22:44.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:23.480 --> 23:23.720


23:32.680 --> 23:35.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:35.620 --> 23:36.720
so stay with us.

23:52.780 --> 23:55.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:55.640 --> 23:58.260
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.700
And here are your hosts.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.660
This is David Crews.

24:08.940 --> 24:09.580
And Daryl Lane.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.440
Jack Chalker's reputation was greatly enhanced

24:12.440 --> 24:14.960
by the popular Well World series of novels.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.980
Now he's at work on a new series,

24:17.180 --> 24:18.840
one which will have four books in it,

24:19.060 --> 24:20.500
entitled The Four Lords of the Diamond.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.040
Two novels have been published so far.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.080
The first is called Lilith, and the second Cerberus.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.280
Chalker comments on the story.

24:29.960 --> 24:35.720
It has a tremendous number of the elements that I have become known for.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.060
It has a lot of new material as well.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.820
It has a lot of political commentary.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.600
It has a lot of social commentary in it.

24:42.840 --> 24:51.920
It is also slam-bang action, Machiavellian intrigue, and everything else, because nobody's going to read your message if you don't entertain first.

24:53.340 --> 24:56.240
As Chalker says, the books have a lot of excitement in them.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.040
In the opening pages of Lilith,

24:58.140 --> 24:59.180
the first book in the series,

24:59.420 --> 25:01.540
a tremendously powerful alien robot

25:01.540 --> 25:04.460
penetrates a top-secret military installation on Earth.

25:04.640 --> 25:09.440
The robot's discovered, but he escapes and heads for a planetary system called the Warden Diamond.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.680
The Earth government sends its top agent.

25:13.500 --> 25:28.200
These are four worlds in one system that are basically a prison planet series, and you get dropped on there, and the foundation idea, which appeals to me an awful lot,

25:28.360 --> 25:37.060
is an alien race discovers us before we discover them decides that it can't win a war against us.

25:37.420 --> 25:44.500
Maybe they're, you know, there's just not as many of them, or there's technological problems or something like that.

25:45.000 --> 25:53.060
So they study us and study us, and they discover that, as in all human societies, there is this massive criminal syndicate,

25:54.060 --> 26:07.520
and that this criminal syndicate, leaders are mostly imprisoned for life on the four lords of the, well, the diamond, the Warden Diamond, these four worlds.

26:09.620 --> 26:18.820
So what the aliens do is they contact these bitter super crooks, and they take out a contract on human civilization.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.100
The agent can't land on any of the four worlds of the Warden Diamond.

26:24.460 --> 26:28.980
A tiny organism on these worlds enters the body and makes a person a virtual prisoner.

26:29.320 --> 26:29.720
Right.

26:29.920 --> 26:34.020
If you try to leave, you die a painful death. There seems to be no cure for it either.

26:34.020 --> 26:41.600
So what the agent does is have his personality implanted into four separate bodies, and these bodies are sent to each of the worlds.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.700
And he monitors what is happening through a computer hookup orbiting the Warden system.

26:46.860 --> 26:59.300
Part of what the book is about is that we have a sort of surrogate him down on each of these worlds who starts off pretty much almost identical to him.

27:00.100 --> 27:05.180
And he's following this whole thing with his whole system of values, beliefs, and so on.

27:05.520 --> 27:10.980
And he's watching the surrogates change into quite different people.

27:12.020 --> 27:17.540
And it begins to eat away at his own sense of values, his own sense of duty.

27:18.200 --> 27:28.600
As a matter of fact, in the third book, he begins to realize that the people who sent him there on this mission anticipated this.

27:29.020 --> 27:37.660
And that his computer detective aide who he has dialogues with and discusses everything with may be more than that.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.420
It may be something of a watchdog.

27:41.420 --> 27:48.580
Chalker promises an exciting ending when the agent struggles with his own newly discovered values, with the computer, and with the aliens.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.760
I don't like cop-outs.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.500
I don't like stringing people along and then not delivering.

27:54.960 --> 28:02.020
So, um, you will get, you will get real, I don't know whether you can say flesh and blood, but something.

28:02.920 --> 28:13.580
Aliens. And, uh, whatever they're made of, uh, you will meet the aliens, you will, uh, have a face down, and the solution to the whole thing

28:13.580 --> 28:19.540
and exactly what's going on is, uh, uh, quite bizarre, and I don't think anybody's going to figure it out.

28:27.540 --> 28:33.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:33.380 --> 28:36.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:38.360 --> 28:51.360


28:51.360 --> 29:00.440


29:02.360 --> 29:05.020
