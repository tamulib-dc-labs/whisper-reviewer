00:08.620 --> 00:13.700
Welcome to the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction today.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.500
A presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.720
And now your hosts.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.380
This is Daryl Lane.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.280
Keith Johnson.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.240
And David Carson.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.440
And the subject of this show will be First Contact.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.560
For over a century at least since H.G. Wells, War of the Worlds, contact with aliens has

00:37.560 --> 00:41.220
been one of the standard motifs of science fiction and certainly one of the most popular.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.400
There are of course a number of possibilities coming under the heading of alien contact.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.880
The aliens may be superior, we may be superior or there may be equality.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.820
The aliens might be friendly, hostile or indifferent.

00:53.940 --> 00:58.000
One of the most popular and fascinating possibilities of all is the story of First

00:58.000 --> 01:02.100
Contact, one of which the first meeting between humans and aliens is treated.

01:02.560 --> 01:06.720
Our present show will be the first of two on the subject of First Contact.

01:09.760 --> 01:14.520
I wish I could convey the atmosphere, the background of this fantastic scene.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.780
Hundreds of cars have parked in a field in back of us and the police are trying to rope

01:18.780 --> 01:21.480
off the roadway leading into the farm, but it's no use.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.260
Breaking right through, cars head lights throw an enormous spotlight on the pit where

01:26.260 --> 01:27.160
the objects have buried.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.000
Now some of the more daring shows now are venturing near the edge.

01:31.460 --> 01:33.620
The city will stand out against the metal scheme.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.720
One man washed his touch and saying he's having an argument with the policeman.

01:37.580 --> 01:38.400
Now the policeman wins.

01:39.540 --> 01:42.860
Now ladies and gentlemen there's something I haven't mentioned in all this excitement,

01:42.880 --> 01:44.720
but it's becoming more distinct.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.380
Perhaps you've caught it already on your radio.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.240
Listen please.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.620
Do you hear it?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.460
It's a curious humming sound that seems to come from inside the object.

01:57.220 --> 02:00.180
I'll move the microphone nearer here.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.340
Now we're not more than 25 feet away.

02:07.180 --> 02:08.060
Can you hear it now?

02:08.840 --> 02:09.620
Professor Pearson.

02:10.260 --> 02:10.800
Yes, sir.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.560
Can you tell us the meaning of that scraping noise inside the thing?

02:15.100 --> 02:17.360
It's possibly the unequal cooling of its surface.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.600
I say do you still think it's a meteor, Professor?

02:20.560 --> 02:21.760
I don't know what to think.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.740
The metal casing is definitely extraterrestrial.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.760
Not found on this earth.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.040
Friction with the earth's atmosphere usually tears holes in a meteorite.

02:31.180 --> 02:34.560
This thing is smooth and you can see it's a cylindrical shape.

02:34.740 --> 02:35.280
Listen, something's happening.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.360
Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrific.

02:38.540 --> 02:41.260
This end of the thing is beginning to flake off.

02:42.180 --> 02:45.400
The top is beginning to rotate like a screw and this thing must be hollow.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.260
He's moving.

02:46.420 --> 02:46.880
Look up ahead.

02:47.020 --> 02:47.560
He's back here.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.220
He's back here.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.060
Keep those kids back.

02:50.180 --> 02:52.240
Keep those idiots back.

02:55.540 --> 02:56.320
Look up.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.540
The top is blue.

02:57.660 --> 02:58.200
Look up there.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.280
The top is blue.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.880
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I've ever witnessed.

03:04.080 --> 03:04.360
Wait a minute.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.360
Someone calling someone or something.

03:08.620 --> 03:12.860
I can see it's turning out of that black hole to luminous disks.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.260
The eyes, it might be a face.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.420
Might be almost heaven.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.200
Something wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake.

03:20.940 --> 03:22.960
Now it's another one and another one and another one.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.940
They look like tentacles to me.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.080
I can see the thing's body.

03:27.220 --> 03:27.660
Now it's large.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.880
Large as a bear.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.020
This one's like wet leather.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.420
But that face, ladies and gentlemen, it's indescribable.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.240
I can hardly force myself to keep looking at it.

03:36.440 --> 03:36.760
It's so awful.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.940
The eyes are black and they gleam like a serpent in the mountains.

03:39.940 --> 03:43.620
That kind of V-shape was alive and dripping from its rimless lips.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.020
It seemed a quiver and pulsating monster or whatever it is can hardly move.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.340
It seems weighed down by possibly gravity or something.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.200
The thing's rising up now and the crowd falls back.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.240
It seems plenty.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.520
Of course, it's a terrifying experience, ladies and gentlemen.

03:58.140 --> 03:58.920
They're fine words.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.140
Pull this microphone with me as they talk.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.020
I'll have to stop the description so I can take a new position.

04:04.160 --> 04:04.660
Hold on, will you please?

04:04.760 --> 04:05.400
I'll be right back in a minute.

04:05.400 --> 04:12.800
Of course, Wales started the tradition of the alien being both physically repulsive

04:12.800 --> 04:14.140
and hostile to human beings.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.520
And the pulp magazines picked it up through the late 20s and the early 30s into the 40s.

04:20.940 --> 04:25.080
The characteristic way of treating an alien was as a so-called bug-eyed monster.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.400
Then the movies picked it up and carried that on through the 50s.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.160
And meantime, the literature took a different trend.

04:34.900 --> 04:40.640
In the 30s, around 1934 Stanley Weinbaum published his story,

04:40.700 --> 04:42.920
which was one of the landmarks in science fiction literature.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.380
It was entitled, The Modern Martian Odyssey.

04:46.980 --> 04:51.980
And it was the first treatment in the modern period of aliens as sensitive creatures.

04:52.200 --> 04:57.940
Ones who were not hostile or aggressive, who had an environment and ecology of their own.

04:58.980 --> 05:00.760
It took place on Mars.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.900
And Weinbaum created three or four different types of aliens on the planet.

05:07.860 --> 05:11.860
And it's interesting for us to go back and read about those aliens

05:11.860 --> 05:14.260
because they were all based on the science of his day.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.900
For instance, one of them was a silicon creature.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.420
They figured Mars was made up of sand.

05:20.740 --> 05:25.940
So one of the aliens that Weinbaum developed for the planet was one who ate sand.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.240
This is quite possible.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.400
There are two kinds of chemicals that can support life.

05:30.620 --> 05:31.760
And carbon and silicon are the two.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.840
We're carbon based and silicon life is possible.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.840
And as Asimov pointed out with Weinbaum, he said he was the first one in the history of science fiction

05:39.940 --> 05:43.260
to develop an environment for an alien.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.180
Conceiving of him as having come from a non-earth environment as being part of an ecology, which was non-human.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.240
Having thought processes, which were non-human.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.280
Having a logical system, which was non-human.

05:56.300 --> 06:03.920
And Weinbaum, of course, also made one of his aliens anyhow a creature named Tweedle very friendly.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.400
A non-hostile, non-aggressive alien, which was very different from the bug-eyed monster tradition.

06:09.580 --> 06:10.580
And it went over very well.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.080
Weinbaum was in his late 20s when that story was published.

06:14.580 --> 06:18.700
And there was an immediate market and immediate imitators doing that kind of story.

06:18.700 --> 06:24.900
An alien who was non-aggressive, with whom contact could be established.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.480
And as I said, that was in 1934.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.740
And wonder stories when Weinbaum wrote that landmark story.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.180
There are several different kinds of first contact.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.700
We're going to be talking about most of them in this treatment.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.140
One of that being mankind's first encounter with alien beings.

06:54.940 --> 07:01.280
Are mankind and several other alien races coming in contact with a new alien race?

07:02.240 --> 07:06.020
Yeah, I think that has to be the criterion that no matter how many aliens have been contacted,

07:06.600 --> 07:11.080
there still is that special feeling about meeting up with a brand new alien culture.

07:11.220 --> 07:12.820
And the humans have to be involved with it, of course.

07:12.980 --> 07:19.600
No matter if they're along with other aliens or not, I think that has to be the main criterion of alien contact.

07:19.600 --> 07:29.880
Of course, the meeting up with the original first race is the most exciting and most important one.

07:30.440 --> 07:35.400
Because up until that time, the human race doesn't even know whether there are other races in existence, presumably.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.240
After one has been in existence, then the rest, you kind of assume, are going to be there.

07:40.240 --> 07:48.440
Usually, a first contact story will be very much tied to its particular culture or historical era.

07:48.440 --> 07:54.680
Today, for instance, we're very much tied up with more sophisticated approaches or more sophisticated environments for it,

07:54.680 --> 07:56.820
simply because we are expecting it to happen.

07:57.800 --> 08:03.120
But way back in the 30s and 40s, not long after the days of the bug-eyed monster motifs,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.200
many of the stories about first contact would be tied to what was happening in the world,

08:08.620 --> 08:11.940
for instance, wars, racial aggressions and so forth.

08:11.940 --> 08:15.900
After all, another race is alien.

08:18.580 --> 08:24.480
Xenophobia or hatred of strangers, for instance, can take place within the human race, not just with alien creatures.

08:25.640 --> 08:33.420
And probably one of the best first contact stories of all by Murray Leinster, entitled, Appropriately Enough First Contact.

08:35.940 --> 08:43.700
A spaceship meets up with another, well, a spaceship from Earth meets up with a spaceship from another culture,

08:43.820 --> 08:46.040
the first time that any kind of alien has ever been contacted.

08:47.020 --> 08:54.720
And one of the things that happens in the story before they actually meet the humans on their ship are discussing and worrying

08:54.720 --> 08:57.440
and wondering about what kinds of creatures are going to meet.

08:58.660 --> 09:01.980
And Leinster has one of the characters say this,

09:02.720 --> 09:04.340
what are we going to do about them?

09:04.880 --> 09:08.300
Maybe these creatures will be aesthetic marvels, nice and friendly and polite,

09:08.720 --> 09:12.220
and underneath with the sneaking brutal ferocity of a Japanese.

09:13.760 --> 09:20.500
Now you obviously know that was written during the middle 40s, during the Second World War, when the Japanese were our enemy.

09:21.340 --> 09:25.480
But you'll find that often to be a motif of the first contact story.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.040
But I remember that story did have a happy ending.

09:28.600 --> 09:36.200
They did, Leinster speculated that perhaps there would be friendliness between the two cultures.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.740
The way he did that was fairly clever though.

09:38.380 --> 09:43.160
Wasn't that the case in which the two different crews actually switched spaceships,

09:43.220 --> 09:46.740
so they went back to each other's planets in each other's spaceships,

09:47.040 --> 09:49.820
and avoided revealing too much about themselves that way?

09:50.300 --> 09:50.600
Yeah.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.960
That's one of the problems you'll meet in many first contact stories,

09:54.300 --> 09:57.140
that we don't want them to know where we are,

09:57.600 --> 10:00.700
and presumably they wouldn't want us to know where they are.

10:01.740 --> 10:05.380
And so one particular branch of the first contact story is when the two cultures,

10:05.520 --> 10:08.980
the humans and the aliens, meet somewhere in a neutral space.

10:10.060 --> 10:17.160
And the whole subject of that first contact story was the aliens and the humans were wondering how can we keep them from knowing where we come from.

10:19.840 --> 10:26.460
Another way an author might introduce a first contact story would be in the way that how Clement designed his story,

10:27.040 --> 10:28.700
The Needle, written in 1950.

10:30.580 --> 10:34.260
That being that it's a first contact story in reverse.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.180
It's the story of an alien making first contact with people on Earth.

10:39.340 --> 10:44.160
And the alien in this particular story is, his form is alien,

10:44.160 --> 10:49.600
but his feelings, his motives, his emotions are very much human.

10:50.100 --> 10:54.680
Therefore, that the reader is able to empathize with him and his plight.

10:55.440 --> 11:01.160
The alien is more or less a detective, and he is chasing a criminal.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.980
The alien's form is a small, gelatinous mass.

11:08.140 --> 11:13.060
And they work in a parasitic relationship with a host,

11:13.400 --> 11:15.580
and that's how the contact is made.

11:17.380 --> 11:22.680
The alien hero inhabits the body of a young man,

11:22.820 --> 11:29.240
and they, through various methods, are able to contact and communicate with each other,

11:29.620 --> 11:33.300
and then they go off in search of the criminal and eventually find and dispose of him.

11:35.620 --> 11:40.700
You think that's fair, you said that the alien was more or less had human feelings.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.080
You mentioned the fact that he was chasing a criminal.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.740
To me, a good first contact story, a good story about aliens,

11:47.860 --> 11:50.500
must have a credible alien.

11:51.340 --> 11:57.660
Surely some creature developing on another planet, another galaxy,

11:58.540 --> 12:02.260
would have a whole system of logic, a whole feelings if they had feelings at all,

12:02.260 --> 12:03.240
but were totally non-human.

12:03.460 --> 12:07.440
In fact, it would probably be very difficult to understand him from the basis of our psychology.

12:08.260 --> 12:13.980
The trouble is it's much easier for a writer to create, say, a bug-eyed monster,

12:14.060 --> 12:20.760
than to try and create an alien and his whole ecology and his whole society simultaneously

12:20.760 --> 12:23.620
and make it incredibly different from human society.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.160
It's a tough thing because we're all humans.

12:25.740 --> 12:32.220
The early presentation of the aliens, what we would call unsophisticated,

12:32.300 --> 12:33.420
I think they almost had to do that.

12:33.600 --> 12:39.960
An alien was usually something that looked weird, but felt like a human being.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.220
Quite often they emphasized physical or physiological characteristics.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.060
He's alien because he's got five arms and three heads and so forth,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.200
and they didn't consider things like his psychology.

12:50.820 --> 12:53.960
Later on, this became a little bit more evident.

12:53.960 --> 13:03.060
In fact, a lot of different parts of human culture were considered in the first context stories.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.640
For example, even religion, in the case of James Blish's case of conscience,

13:07.980 --> 13:12.440
in which an entire planet, according to what Blish is trying to make us believe,

13:12.820 --> 13:15.700
has been created by the adversary, by Satan,

13:16.180 --> 13:22.020
and the aliens on this, Reptilian, though they may be, are perfect creatures

13:22.020 --> 13:25.140
who have not evidently been involved in original sin.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.560
They're still living in essentially a garden of Eden sort of thing.

13:29.060 --> 13:33.360
And the reaction of the human protagonist to this is the focus of the novel.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.540
The aliens on the planet were Reptilian or like small dinosaurs.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.500
They were like a race of Vulcans, Mr. Spock, from Star Trek, and they used pure reason.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.620
That's one of the things that bothered the protagonist, the Jesuit priest,

13:46.620 --> 13:50.920
is that they had a perfect society, a perfect culture,

13:51.240 --> 13:57.840
yet they had no such thing as faith, no such thing as religion, in fact, no emotions.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.780
They went totally unreasoned and they had a perfect culture.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.640
And to the priest, that shook the very foundations of his faith,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.060
because to have religion, to have faith, you have to have faith.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.220
And these creatures did not know what that was.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.980
So it was a crisis of conscience for him.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.740
The ending of that novel, you might remember, was very ambiguous.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.040
I think Blish intended for that to be so.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.900
Yes. The planet was created out of an element, lithium, I believe, that was inherently unstable.

14:29.580 --> 14:35.120
And when an earthman landed on the planet or started to set up factories of certain kind

14:35.120 --> 14:41.620
on the planet to use this lithium, or either he caused the planet to disintegrate or to blow up,

14:41.620 --> 14:47.360
or the priest at the end of the novel exercises the planet and it disappears.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.840
And you are not told which actually was effective in the destruction of the alien race.

14:55.140 --> 14:58.800
Some readers might find that novel a little bit slow, but I think it's a fascinating treatment

14:58.800 --> 15:05.080
and probably more than, I would say, more than 90% of the first contact stories and novels that have been written.

15:05.160 --> 15:10.980
I think it's probably truer to some of the feelings that the human race will have

15:10.980 --> 15:13.320
when we actually do make first contact.

15:14.180 --> 15:19.380
I think one of the first problems the human race will have is, are these creatures created by God?

15:20.160 --> 15:21.040
Do they have souls?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.280
You know, given the fact they have intelligence, yet do they have souls?

15:24.780 --> 15:29.160
I think it's very easy here to see an analogy between the explorers of the old world,

15:29.260 --> 15:33.860
the Spanish particularly, when they came to the New World and discovered the Indian cultures.

15:33.860 --> 15:41.860
They had philosophical theological debates on whether these creatures, these Indians, had souls.

15:42.420 --> 15:46.360
You know, they could kill them and say, well, there's nothing wrong with this, they're animals, they don't have souls.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.700
I think we're going to have that problem when we do run across aliens.

15:50.460 --> 15:51.900
It's going to be a religious problem.

15:52.600 --> 16:01.160
And I think Blishe's book, A Case of Conscience, is probably the, well, is the classic treatment of that particular aspect of first contact.

16:02.960 --> 16:09.780
Another value or another insight that a first contact story can give people is to put a perspective on the human race.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.280
Of course, we think of ourselves usually as a center of the universe.

16:14.580 --> 16:20.420
We think of ourselves as being the most intelligent creatures, at least on this planet, if not in the universe, of the galaxy.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.940
And there are a number of first contact stories in which we learn humility.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.520
One of the best, I think, is Gordon R. Dixon's Dolphin's Way, published in the mid-60s.

16:30.520 --> 16:37.220
John Varley's universe, a good part of it, or the background of many of his books, comes from a similar idea.

16:37.980 --> 16:48.160
A group of a race of super powerful invading beings has taken over the earth and has decided to contact the most intelligent species,

16:48.420 --> 16:50.120
which in this case are dolphins and killer whales.

16:50.120 --> 17:00.660
In fact, we learn in one point in one of his novels that the invaders classify human intelligence, or classify terrestrial intelligences on three levels.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.740
There are the intelligent ones, which are dolphins and killer whales.

17:04.280 --> 17:17.640
There are hive minds, or levels in which groups of species can work together, like an ant colony or a termite colony.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.580
And he groups human beings along with these.

17:19.940 --> 17:23.260
Human beings are not intelligent individually, according to this classification.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.840
And on the third level are animals. And that's a very humiliating thing.

17:27.480 --> 17:34.660
The invaders wipe out civilization on the earth completely, human civilization anyway, without even stopping to worry about it.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.280
And they don't even contact human beings.

17:39.820 --> 17:49.100
Usually in most of these first contact stories, even if the contact is negative, that is the humans are made into an inferior race,

17:49.240 --> 17:53.920
or are shown as an inferior race compared to the aliens, at least there are some kind of communication possibilities.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.380
In truth, it might be the case that an alien would be so different from human beings, we wouldn't even be able to communicate with them.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.540
There are psychologists who would be so different that we'd have no common meeting ground.

18:05.540 --> 18:12.080
Or the technology on both sides, or the lack of it, maybe such that there would be no medium for communication.

18:12.200 --> 18:17.060
Yes, their technology may be so far ahead of ours that we don't even think the same as they do.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.940
I think one of the more interesting treatments in first contact would be Stanislaw Lim's Solaris,

18:23.160 --> 18:30.120
in that mankind has found a planet orbiting around a binary star system.

18:30.720 --> 18:38.840
But the planet's orbit is stable, which would be impossible, so they go to the planet to investigate why this planet's orbit is stable,

18:39.520 --> 18:48.400
and find out that the ocean on this planet, which comprises most of the planets set for a few islands, is a sentient or intelligent.

18:48.760 --> 18:55.460
So they set up stations and start trying to communicate with the planet, and therein lies the crux of the story.

18:56.700 --> 19:09.120
The hero, Chris Kelvin, has landed on a space station orbiting Solaris, and it has a few members of the crew left alive,

19:09.860 --> 19:11.820
a Dr. Snow and a Dr. Satorius.

19:13.240 --> 19:22.600
They both are, in essence, hiding out in certain parts of the ship and staying closed away from each other.

19:22.600 --> 19:29.660
And Kelvin has the responsibility or the obligation of finding out why all this is going on.

19:30.240 --> 19:38.700
During the early part of Kelvin's stay on the space station, his dead wife, Rhea, is materialized onboard the ship by the ocean Solaris.

19:40.460 --> 19:47.880
He is immediately horrified and finds a way to get rid of his first wife by sending her off in a ship.

19:48.460 --> 19:53.060
And about a day or two after that happens, his wife is rematerialized on the ship.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.900
This time her body is not composed of atoms and molecules.

19:58.060 --> 20:02.320
The way we know them is composed of neutrinos being extremely dense.

20:03.380 --> 20:11.440
But aside from that makeup of her form, she is totally human in every respect and is deeply in love with him.

20:11.440 --> 20:18.600
His wife had committed suicide previously because Kelvin had left her and she, in essence, died of loneliness.

20:20.240 --> 20:26.700
There ensues a type of morality play in which Kelvin tries to deduce why his wife is materialized at this particular time and space.

20:30.200 --> 20:38.180
And there's several levels to the story at this point in which Kelvin is trying to figure out why she got there, how she got there,

20:39.460 --> 20:42.380
why all this is happening at this particular point in time.

20:43.120 --> 20:59.880
And he finally deduces that it was the ocean which materialized his wife because his wife has knowledge which she would not have normally had had she been a living person and entity.

21:00.120 --> 21:07.080
She had knowledge of Kelvin's, some of his innermost thoughts which he had kept secret from his wife while she was alive.

21:08.560 --> 21:22.080
And in the end of the story, even though Kelvin can communicate with the creation of Solaris, he cannot communicate with Solaris itself.

21:22.380 --> 21:33.480
The concepts, the thought processes, our emotions, if there are any, of this being which is literally an ocean on this entire planet,

21:33.480 --> 21:41.140
are so far from that of human emotions, the thought processes, there can be no direct contact.

21:41.680 --> 21:48.640
And the enigma of Solaris at the beginning of the book is left the same at the end of the book.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.480
You'd probably call that a thought novel, wouldn't you? More or less on the...

21:53.380 --> 21:57.020
It's very much, I would call, psychological science fiction.

21:57.020 --> 22:05.400
But it's not so much the action, the typical hero or heroine, but the possibilities.

22:06.140 --> 22:09.140
Yeah, the psychological interplay between the two cultures and so forth.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.180
Music

22:26.200 --> 22:32.920
One of the more intelligently written first contact stories to come out recently was a Moten God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pernell.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.500
And Keith Johnson has a critique on that book.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.620
Larry Niven and Jerry Pernell have collaborated on several works.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.880
The Moten God's Eye is perhaps their most successful effort.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.240
It is a return to the bug-eyed monster theme, but with some significant differences from the usual treatments.

22:50.220 --> 22:56.000
The plot is an exciting and complex one, so much so that the reader will probably not pick up every twist upon the first reading.

22:56.660 --> 23:00.300
The action takes place in the future history that has been constructed by Pernell.

23:01.100 --> 23:05.680
Mankind has spread out among the stars. He has started wars and built up empires.

23:06.260 --> 23:11.840
And at the time of Mot has begun rebuilding a new empire from the ashes of the most recent galaxy-wide conflict.

23:12.680 --> 23:17.720
But then the monster arrives. She is not recognized as a monster upon arrival.

23:18.340 --> 23:24.780
Not until books end do the protagonist realize that this totally alien species that they have met is the deadly enemy of all humans.

23:25.240 --> 23:30.660
This terrible secret is revealed gradually, piece by piece, to the reader in a very hitch-cocky and way.

23:31.820 --> 23:36.640
That first alien visitor has come into human space on the wings of a solar sail after a very long journey.

23:37.340 --> 23:42.460
Human beings do not learn a great deal from the creature, however, largely because she is dead by the time they pick her up.

23:43.220 --> 23:48.520
So the empire decides to send a scientific and military expedition to the planet inhabited by the alien race.

23:49.520 --> 23:54.600
The expedition is commandeered by a character who is a cross between George Patton and Makita Khrushchev.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.440
His characterization provokes some humor in places.

23:58.400 --> 24:04.500
The captain of a second ship, Rod Blaine, is the real hero, however, and he undergoes some unusual and suspenseful adventures.

24:05.340 --> 24:09.520
His crew meets the aliens, talks with them, studies them, and becomes rather friendly with them.

24:10.160 --> 24:15.540
In fact, before too long, the captain finds his ship overrun with aliens. Very small ones.

24:15.540 --> 24:20.760
You see, the aliens come in several versions. There are administrators and ambassador types.

24:21.180 --> 24:24.600
There are strong, stupid farmers and small, dexterous doctors.

24:25.580 --> 24:30.260
These are not simply different occupations. They are completely separate subspecies of the alien race.

24:31.320 --> 24:36.740
On Earth, the situation would be similar if gorillas had evolved a low level of human intelligence and become farmers.

24:37.380 --> 24:41.240
Orangutans had become electrical engineers, and chimpanzees had become jet pilots.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.740
We humans, of course, would be the administrators.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.220
Or perhaps we would be professional warriors.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.960
This is one of the aliens' deadly secrets.

24:50.580 --> 24:58.320
One of their forms is made up of a powerful, vicious set of super soldiers who could make the alien equivalent of mincemeat out of any human military man.

24:59.360 --> 25:04.180
But there is a more terrible fact concealed by the aliens, and that is overpopulation.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.260
Every alien must be made pregnant periodically, or she will die.

25:08.260 --> 25:15.920
This has, of course, led to terrible overcrowding on the planet, so much so that periodically civilization has blasted itself back to savagery.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.000
The planet has gone through thousands of these cycles of growth and catastrophe.

25:20.840 --> 25:28.140
That pattern has imbued the race with a deep, frustrating fatalism, a sense of futility that makes their psychology very different from that of us humans.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.160
At one point, a crew member who has stumbled across the secret exclaims to one of the creatures,

25:33.160 --> 25:37.720
but man, there's got to be a way to solve this, to which the alien replies,

25:38.420 --> 25:40.780
I am not a man, and there doesn't got to be a way.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.480
And that's another reason I don't want contact between your species and mine.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.820
You're all crazy. You think every problem has a solution.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.360
The action is fast throughout the novel.

25:52.220 --> 25:55.560
The crew of Captain Blaine's ship have interesting adventures with the friendly aliens.

25:56.380 --> 26:02.740
Three of his crewmen are unknowingly abandoned on the planet and have some hair-raising adventures with unfriendly aliens, ending in their deaths.

26:02.740 --> 26:07.780
The unsuspecting expedition returns home. They even bring three of the beings with them.

26:08.800 --> 26:15.080
But in true space opera fashion, the heroes uncover the truth by means of their human cleverness and isolate the aliens in their home system.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.520
And the novel ends, as do many of Niven's works, somewhat inconclusively.

26:20.660 --> 26:25.140
The book offers several fascinating new concepts and more than a few contrasting features.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.840
Perhaps these are a result of the dual authorship.

26:27.840 --> 26:34.600
The empire is dreadfully old-fashioned, is modeled after a 15th-century monarchy with its hierarchical structure.

26:35.460 --> 26:39.060
Women are worshipped in a way that must have set Ursula Le Guin's teeth on edge.

26:39.940 --> 26:42.720
There is a distinct flavor of space opera in the action.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.760
Yet there are some recent social issues incorporated in the book.

26:47.440 --> 26:54.500
The overpopulation problem of the aliens is probably Niven's idea of the dangers that face human society before the end of the century today.

26:55.680 --> 27:00.360
Again, the aliens are old-fashioned monsters, even if nobody realizes it at first.

27:01.280 --> 27:06.040
We are led to understand why they are monsters, however, almost to the point of sympathizing with them.

27:06.780 --> 27:11.760
One of the most difficult tasks in the writing of science fiction is the construction of a truly alien being.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.460
Pornel and Niven have done an admirable job.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.840
The novel is not without flaws. Human society is depressingly similar to today's version of it.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.640
There are some funny anachronisms, which I suspect my colleagues will bring up in a few moments.

27:26.800 --> 27:31.680
But for imaginative invention and excitement, the motin god's eye will fit on anyone's bookshelf.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.740
Niven and Pornel have done something very interesting in that book.

27:38.380 --> 27:45.700
Earlier, we had all of us recognized and mentioned that there has been an increase in sophistication from the early treatment of aliens.

27:45.700 --> 27:51.600
These are bug-eyed monsters evolving through wine bomb stories where they are friendly and non-aggressive.

27:52.180 --> 27:56.320
This, in a sense, is a return to the bug-eyed monster. They don't look like bug-eyed monsters.

27:56.520 --> 28:01.120
In fact, some of the humans, if I remember, almost want to pet them because they have soft fur on their bodies.

28:01.640 --> 28:09.120
But on the other hand, their exterior appearance belies a very hostile intention toward humans.

28:09.120 --> 28:17.460
In a sense, this is going backwards. Another interesting fact, or what, a sophisticated or clever thing that Niven and Pornel have done in the book,

28:17.620 --> 28:26.280
is the levels of comparative intelligence between the humans and the moaties, as I believe they are called in the book, because they come from the moat.

28:27.780 --> 28:33.680
When you come right down to it, the moaties or the aliens were more intelligent than the humans were.

28:33.680 --> 28:40.960
It was only the lack of an interstellar drive, I think, that had remained in their own little section of the galaxy.

28:40.960 --> 28:45.600
They were bottled up in their own solar system. In fact, it was kind of an interesting twist.

28:46.100 --> 29:00.400
Quite often we read about galactic empires, asimovs, and many others, in which the human beings are asked whether they want to join this benevolent galaxy-wide empire.

29:00.400 --> 29:06.660
And here it's the other way around. The aliens still are more intelligent and more competent than we are, but they're asking whether they can join our empire.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.400
This is Daryl Lane, Keith Johnson, and David Carson.

29:31.260 --> 29:42.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, in conjunction with Odessa College and KOCV FM.
