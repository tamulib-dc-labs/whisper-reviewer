00:01.320 --> 00:04.460
This is Daryl Lane, Keith Johnson, and David Carson.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.160
This will be the second of two shows on the subject of First Contact.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.240
You'll remember from our last show that a First Contact story is one which humans and

00:12.240 --> 00:13.640
aliens meet for the first time.

00:14.380 --> 00:18.080
Our treatment of the topic this time will emphasize movies dealing with the First Contact

01:18.240 --> 01:21.440
The 40s and 50s would be a classic period for the Bug-Eyed Monster movie.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.680
Recall some of the titles of those years.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.480
It came from outer space.

01:27.200 --> 01:27.700
The blob.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.120
Them.

01:30.020 --> 01:30.480
The thing.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.140
I remember a lot of those movies too, particularly it came from outer space, were in 3D.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.860
And of course that was even more horrifying when your Bug-Eyed Monster would be in three

01:39.860 --> 01:40.900
dimensions rather than two.

01:41.340 --> 01:46.200
And of course everyone had to wear the glasses, the special 3D glasses to appreciate the effects.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.940
But of course those movies were almost all the same.

01:51.100 --> 01:56.740
They all tried to outdo each other in the weirdness of their Bug-Eyed Monsters.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.460
The hostility that they would have toward humans.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.180
Destructive power that they each had.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.320
Today would seem a little ridiculous to us.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.040
Of course there are some movies today which we can talk about a little bit later which

02:09.040 --> 02:13.020
go back to that early trend of the Bug-Eyed Monsters.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.060
I think one of the reasons for that might be the time period in which they were made.

02:17.240 --> 02:23.560
Being in the 40s and the 50s, the era of World War II, shortly after World War II, entering

02:23.560 --> 02:25.780
into McCarthyism and the Cold War.

02:26.920 --> 02:33.180
Anything that wasn't one of us must be one of them and couldn't possibly be friendly.

02:34.640 --> 02:42.400
And that probably led to a lot of the, it came from outer space type of movie.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.500
Of course that has a long tradition behind it, the monster.

02:45.860 --> 02:50.660
Back to the very beginnings of literature, human literature, the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh,

02:50.780 --> 02:54.940
the Greek epics of Homer, the Cyclops, the One Eyed Creatures.

02:56.460 --> 03:02.140
All the ancient heroes had to face some kind of monster, some kind of alien creature.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.980
You can trace that through all periods of literary history, all cultures.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.100
And of course for science fiction that was perfect.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.480
They could pick up on that, they could have their Bug-Eyed Monsters arrive in space vehicles.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.880
They could do anything they wanted to in making them weird.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.860
It was just another vehicle for the larger than life hero in the...

03:20.860 --> 03:21.780
Right, a formula story.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.980
Out of this world monster.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.240
A formula story, exactly.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.160
And of course all those Bug-Eyed Monster movies would have a beautiful heroine.

03:28.400 --> 03:33.820
Of course with not many clothes on, of course the monster usually wanted her for some reason.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.100
And the hero had to rescue her.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.520
And it was a typical formula story.

03:39.460 --> 03:44.420
One of the first breaks in those formula stories was Robert Wise's The Day the Earth

03:44.420 --> 03:45.080
Stood Still.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.620
And this was made in 1951 and it was...

03:50.620 --> 04:00.520
The premise behind the story was an advanced being and his companion land on the earth,

04:01.380 --> 04:03.400
make initial contact with the earthlings.

04:03.780 --> 04:07.220
And the earthlings first contact with them is violent.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.760
They shoot him on the spot.

04:10.080 --> 04:18.460
And his message is that if the earth doesn't shape up and get their internal conflicts

04:18.460 --> 04:22.240
under control they will not be allowed to take them off planet.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.740
And he is in essence a benevolent alien.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.880
And this was a new sort of trend for science fiction movies.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.040
This hadn't really been expounded on before.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.760
Especially at that time.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.420
That wasn't long after the Second World War.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.080
No one is right there on the mill with McCarthyism period.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.120
Right.

04:43.420 --> 04:47.400
You recall that story by Leinster where he equates the aliens with the Japanese, you

04:47.400 --> 04:48.240
know the vicious enemy.

04:48.540 --> 04:53.860
To have a movie like this in the, what was it, the 51 where the alien is friendly and

04:53.860 --> 04:58.680
non-aggressive and the humans he comes in contact with wish to destroy him.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.980
That must have been a great change for theater goers to run across that kind of science fiction

05:02.980 --> 05:03.280
movie.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.960
And it was extremely popular.

05:05.740 --> 05:06.920
Wasn't there a robot in that movie?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.600
Wasn't his companion, you mentioned his companion.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.220
Wasn't the companion a robot or a?

05:10.700 --> 05:19.360
Yes, in the movie Clatu the quote human alien had a companion robot named Gort.

05:20.060 --> 05:26.460
Now in the short story this is taken from farewell to the master.

05:27.560 --> 05:34.460
It ends up that the master is really the robot and the companion is the human.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.460
But this is never really brought out in the movie version of it.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.500
Gort in the movie is a sort of inner planetary policeman.

05:45.120 --> 05:50.340
Of course in a way the day the Earth stood still was tied to its time period.

05:51.440 --> 05:59.740
The war was over and treaties had been signed and this might have been a way of expressing

05:59.740 --> 06:03.440
the brotherhood of man.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.640
The fact that we had gone through a huge war.

06:06.220 --> 06:08.220
We killed other human beings, other living creatures.

06:08.920 --> 06:13.780
And the movie did not, I don't think it presented humans in a very fine way.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.260
We could see ourselves as war makers, as aggressors, as having gone through a terrible war.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
Perhaps that movie had a message to it.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.080
Making us see ourselves is a great country.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.300
I believe it did.

06:24.920 --> 06:33.600
It used a common formula for movies of that time in which the military were the war makers

06:33.600 --> 06:42.300
and the scientists were sort of the intellectual far-seeing peacemakers.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.600
And that was brought out at the end of the movie where the collection of scientists gathered

06:46.600 --> 06:52.920
and they wanted to speak with Clatu and the military were saying, well no this is now

06:52.920 --> 06:55.600
dangerous and it's now a military operation.

06:55.820 --> 07:00.740
And then Clatu comes out and gives his final and rather famous speech and then they depart.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.680
Another movie which treated the aliens more sensitively I think was also in the 1950s,

07:07.180 --> 07:09.080
1955, This Island Earth.

07:10.460 --> 07:17.920
This Island Earth, the crux of that story was there was a planet farthest apart of our

07:17.920 --> 07:26.020
galaxy which was at war with a totally alien race and they had come to Earth to use some

07:26.020 --> 07:33.160
of the Earth people's technology plus their expertise and just the manpower to build some

07:33.160 --> 07:39.880
more weapons and then transport them back to Madaluna which was the planet which they

07:39.880 --> 07:40.400
came from.

07:40.780 --> 07:45.060
There are a highly intelligent race which used several subsystems of the race on their

07:45.060 --> 07:54.460
planet, one of them being a rather insect-like monster which provided one of the more harrowing

07:54.460 --> 07:59.420
moments in the movie where the monster gets loose on board the ship and of course chases

07:59.420 --> 08:02.020
the harrowing around the ship before it's eventually destroyed.

08:04.700 --> 08:08.880
It treated the aliens as a benevolent creature in the end.

08:10.100 --> 08:15.980
The alien who transported them to Madaluna takes them back to Earth and leaves them there before

08:15.980 --> 08:21.060
his ship eventually runs out of fuel and burns up in the atmosphere.

08:22.980 --> 08:27.680
But at the same time even in the 50s you would have, in fact you always have this, a return

08:27.680 --> 08:28.920
to the bug-eyed monster motif.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.440
The first version of the invasion of the body snatchers was in 1956.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.960
Of course we've had another version recently.

08:37.260 --> 08:40.220
Yes, it was remade in 1979.

08:40.740 --> 08:43.060
But that is totally a scare movie.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.640
Not only are you meeting aliens but their particular form.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.880
In fact they're not intelligent aliens if I recall correctly.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.700
They simply take over the host body in a habit.

08:53.780 --> 08:58.960
They take over the host body and they overlay the host with their own emotions.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.100
Their own motivations.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.280
Well really their own motivations.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.360
They're not really very emotional creatures.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.040
They're very unemotional, very logical.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.200
You don't get very good grasp of what the aliens are like at all.

09:15.320 --> 09:24.080
The aliens are a spore-like creature which is a parasitic and it literally reconstructs

09:24.080 --> 09:32.460
a new human from the original human's tissue and finally absorbs it into its own system

09:32.460 --> 09:38.420
and kills the original human and the duplicate human comes alive with all the memories of

09:38.420 --> 09:42.680
the original human but in sort of a new order, new pattern.

09:43.260 --> 09:44.840
And of course they are here to conquer.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.940
They are here to take over the earth.

09:47.480 --> 09:52.340
Even if it isn't an intelligent conflict, why, that is the kind of thing that they are

09:52.340 --> 09:52.940
built to do.

09:53.320 --> 10:00.120
This is taken from an old theory by Arrhenius that life on earth started from spores which

10:00.120 --> 10:04.460
migrated through space on the wings of the solar wind perhaps, landed on earth and then

10:04.460 --> 10:05.460
began life here.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.980
It's an interesting theory, discredited but still interesting.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.200
Well the second version of the movie, the recent one, I think it's two years old or

10:11.200 --> 10:16.380
so, the beginning of that I think in a lot of ways the earlier version was the better,

10:16.500 --> 10:16.960
the classic.

10:17.320 --> 10:22.340
But the beginning of the second one was well done showing the spores traveling through

10:22.340 --> 10:26.340
space, arriving on earth and becoming part of our ecology and eventually taking over

10:26.340 --> 10:26.860
human bodies.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.380
But that's a true horror movie.

10:30.980 --> 10:37.760
You know not only are we up against aliens but when you think of some non-human creature

10:37.760 --> 10:42.760
taking over your body or destroying your existence but using your physical structure where you

10:42.760 --> 10:46.780
have no control, that's, you can see where people would be horrified at such a thing.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.980
In most first context stories at least you have some kind of alien with a personality

10:51.500 --> 10:54.820
hostile or non-hostile, you can talk with them but here you haven't got anything you

10:54.820 --> 10:56.880
can really talk to or argue with.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.080
Now the aliens are really humans who have changed their mind.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.500
That's really the only way you could look at them in the movie.

11:07.220 --> 11:15.720
It's an alien being in the movie was somebody who you once knew but suddenly their system

11:15.720 --> 11:23.120
of values and what they held dear to them they have just simply changed their mind and

11:23.120 --> 11:24.440
become a different person.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.360
2001 I think could be called the first contact movie.

11:29.120 --> 11:36.080
It's a very different type, again you have no aliens in it but it is an excellent first

11:36.080 --> 11:41.920
course based on Clark's short story The Sentinel and along with Kubrick he collaborated on

11:41.920 --> 11:47.940
the movie and it probably is, most people consider it to be the best science fiction

11:47.940 --> 11:52.280
movie I ever made, obviously a matter of opinion.

11:54.420 --> 12:01.520
But of course similar also to his book Childhoods End in which the alien, even though we never

12:01.520 --> 12:05.080
meet the aliens and don't know much about them they are clearly superior to human beings.

12:05.240 --> 12:09.720
In fact they have come in and taken a guiding hand in the development of the human species.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.680
Yes, they have actually, yes, you get the impression at the first of the movie that

12:13.680 --> 12:15.600
they had been responsible for evolution.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.380
Taking an ape-like or man-like creature was still seemingly an ape and guiding it along

12:21.380 --> 12:26.960
evolutionary paths until they reached the point they can travel to the moon and find

12:26.960 --> 12:35.320
the next signal in the terms of this huge monolith and it emitted some high, some signal,

12:35.500 --> 12:40.740
some frequency that they could follow and they sent, of course they sent their huge ship

12:41.500 --> 12:44.280
following that signal with Hal, a computer in control of it.

12:44.960 --> 12:49.740
And at the end of the movie of course the star child, very ambiguous ending but still

12:49.740 --> 12:51.020
at the same time it was optimistic.

12:51.640 --> 12:57.140
You get the idea of a new stage in human evolution just as the ape-like creatures had become

12:57.140 --> 13:03.700
men at the beginning because of the alien's help that humans in the movie were ready to

13:03.700 --> 13:09.280
move on to some further stage in evolution, some higher level because of the help of the

13:09.280 --> 13:09.660
aliens.

13:10.180 --> 13:16.120
And I think this is about the only way that you can depict an alien who is very far above

13:16.120 --> 13:21.260
you. You can't really, we can't do it because we're limited in our human imaginations and

13:21.260 --> 13:24.820
you almost have to depict him sort of off stage meddling in human affairs.

13:25.060 --> 13:28.780
And many times in the movies they have to depict him off stage because special effects

13:28.780 --> 13:29.820
couldn't accommodate him.

13:30.080 --> 13:30.720
That's true too.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.660
Well with that particular movie of course there was no problem with the special effects

13:34.660 --> 13:41.940
on the alien. All they had to do was to conceive of this monolithic signal, this monolith I

13:41.940 --> 13:42.440
guess of what you call it.

13:42.460 --> 13:48.800
Some sort of transponder or you never really were given a concrete definition as to what

13:48.800 --> 13:55.120
it was other than it was something that Signal D'Arre brought about, Jump and Man's intellect

13:55.120 --> 13:56.400
or his reasoning.

13:57.140 --> 14:02.360
It's interesting to read the story, the Sentinel from which the movie came. There's a very

14:02.360 --> 14:09.680
great difference. In the story an expedition to the moon comes upon a monolith. It's on

14:09.680 --> 14:12.440
the surface by the way, in the movie it was buried, they had to dig it out.

14:13.080 --> 14:18.100
But in the story it was on the surface and of course it stuck out to such an extent that

14:18.100 --> 14:19.080
the humans couldn't miss it.

14:19.940 --> 14:24.280
And they go up and they study it, they realize it's the product of a far superior culture.

14:25.320 --> 14:31.440
They also can calculate that it's been millions of years since the monolith was set up on

14:31.440 --> 14:36.800
the moon. They don't know what the purpose of it is. But of course the point of the story

14:36.800 --> 14:40.880
is wondering, who were they, when did they come, why did they come, where are they now.

14:41.700 --> 14:46.880
And Clark leads us to believe at the end of it that the aliens, whoever they were, set

14:46.880 --> 14:53.260
this up on the moon to signal them as to when the humans had reached a sufficient point

14:53.260 --> 14:55.920
in technology that they could reach the moon from Earth.

14:57.420 --> 15:01.420
And of course the movie created one of the greatest or most memorable characters if you

15:01.420 --> 15:07.280
can call him that in science fiction environment and that of course is Hal, the computer. That

15:07.280 --> 15:10.560
was well done I thought. He becomes a character in his own right.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.840
Consider the television audience. You have to have something that's familiar, you have

15:29.840 --> 15:34.920
to have something that's sharp. If you had a show that showed aliens as benevolent or

15:34.920 --> 15:38.900
dealt with any kinds of deep questions regarding first contact, I don't think it would work.

15:38.900 --> 15:43.060
You have to go back to the bug-eyed monster, the menace, something that people can feel

15:43.060 --> 15:49.760
quickly and understand quickly. You can't get as much depth in a movie as you can in

15:49.760 --> 15:55.600
a book and you can get even less depth in a TV show. You have to stick to action. Even

15:55.600 --> 16:00.500
Star Trek for example, although it did look at a lot of different interesting themes and

16:00.940 --> 16:05.500
work on some controversial subjects, was essentially as Roddenberry admitted, a wagon train to the

16:05.500 --> 16:06.900
stars. It was an adventure series.

16:07.420 --> 16:12.380
There were a number of Star Trek episodes which dealt with first contact. One of them

16:12.380 --> 16:14.420
I think based on a Frederick Brown short story, Arena.

16:17.220 --> 16:27.080
Yeah, that one being where the enterprise encountered an aggressive alien force on one

16:27.080 --> 16:35.340
of our Federation planets and drove them off planet and then continued to pursue them across

16:35.500 --> 16:46.900
the galaxy and were stopped by extremely vastly superior race and one person from each crew

16:46.900 --> 16:53.840
on each ship was taken down to fight in this arena on this world. One being the Gorn,

16:54.660 --> 17:00.380
a lizard-like creature and the other being Captain Kirk. They eventually had a rather

17:00.380 --> 17:05.800
long and arduous battle at which Kirk was eventually victorious. He decided not to kill

17:05.800 --> 17:13.020
the Gorn which proved our superiority and our humanity over the Gorn race and we were

17:13.020 --> 17:22.840
spared annihilation because the superior race which was hosting this battle had decided

17:22.840 --> 17:29.180
to kill the victor because they would be the most dangerous, but instead they had spared

17:29.180 --> 17:33.440
both the Gorn and the human race and allowed them to live on.

17:35.140 --> 17:42.860
That's almost an obvious way of treating the first contact material in that you have an

17:42.860 --> 17:47.880
alien who looks like a reptile, who is a reptile. You have a human being and they are going

17:47.880 --> 17:54.640
at one-on-one combat with the loser to lose everything his ship, his crew and so forth.

17:55.600 --> 18:02.020
That isn't a motif in many ancient literatures, in fact in the Greek epics, in the Iliad,

18:02.520 --> 18:08.140
the prototype of war stories. Various times in the battle, one of the Greek warriors,

18:08.300 --> 18:13.500
one of the Trojan warriors would step out into an arena, the battlefield, everybody

18:13.500 --> 18:18.120
else would gather around and they would go at it one-on-one. The rules being the winner

18:18.120 --> 18:20.320
would take all, the loser would of course lose all.

18:20.780 --> 18:25.060
That seems to be fairly common in a lot of cultures, that was fairly common in the Indian

18:25.060 --> 18:30.360
cultures in the Northern United States and down in New Mexico and South America. It's

18:30.360 --> 18:34.360
also fairly common in African cultures, so this seems to be a world-

18:34.360 --> 18:40.720
Easily translatable into the alien first contact material, very dramatic, very visual, and I

18:40.720 --> 18:44.220
thought that was one of their better episodes. That's one thing television can do, it does

18:44.220 --> 18:48.200
have limitations, but it's very dramatic, it's very visual, it's very immediate, and

18:48.200 --> 18:52.280
they have that kind of contact. Of course with the message at the end of it, when the

18:52.280 --> 18:56.200
human did not kill the alien, the idea that non-aggression got him something.

18:57.240 --> 19:01.240
A couple of times Star Trek did manage to bring across a first contact story that was

19:01.240 --> 19:07.120
not immediate action oriented. The story of the Hortov, of course, is one of their best

19:07.120 --> 19:13.920
ones. An alien being was apparently killing off a colony on some planet and it turned out

19:13.920 --> 19:19.400
that this alien being was the last survivor of an almost dead race who was protecting

19:19.400 --> 19:24.280
her young. They didn't recognize, the humans did not recognize this because the young and

19:24.280 --> 19:30.500
the alien herself looked like pieces of rock, pieces of mineral, but it turned out that

19:31.200 --> 19:36.260
she was merely exhibiting mother love. This is kind of a difficult thing to portray on

19:36.260 --> 19:40.160
television, and I think it was to Star Trek's credit they were able to bring it off successfully.

19:41.800 --> 19:46.160
I think one of the best things television has done as long as we're talking about television in regard to

19:46.160 --> 19:50.940
first contact stories is one that I don't often think of as first contact, but I believe it. It should be

19:50.940 --> 19:56.820
considered as such, and that would be Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles. I think of all the first

19:56.820 --> 20:02.880
contact works I can think of. Perhaps this better than any other illustrates the learning of something

20:02.880 --> 20:09.380
about ourselves, a reflection of our own culture because of the contact. Of course all we do, we go to

20:09.380 --> 20:18.520
Mars and contact the remnants of a much, much older Martian culture, and because of that contact we see

20:18.520 --> 20:25.420
ourselves as hostile, as aggressive. Of course this is a series of short stories, you know, over a

20:25.420 --> 20:32.300
period of time. We see ourselves as materialistic, you know, all of the bad qualities which the

20:32.300 --> 20:40.240
human race does have. And of course finally the humans that are on Mars are locked there because of the fact

20:40.240 --> 20:47.780
Earth destroys itself, which they can tell, but I believe that was a three-part episode on television. I think

20:47.780 --> 20:54.420
one of the better things they've done on television, but it was excellent first contact material.

20:55.080 --> 21:07.380
Yes, the switching from television to movies, the movies recently had two very different first contact.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.100
Extremes almost.

21:09.320 --> 21:16.640
Extremes in the thematic approach. The first one we'll talk about is Alien, a movie directed by Ridley Scott and

21:16.640 --> 21:27.520
written by Dan O'Bannon and others. It is essentially a something-goes-bump-in-the-night horror movie in that the

21:29.300 --> 21:36.820
Earthlings are traveling along in a gigantic mining ship and they're awakened by their computers and told that

21:36.820 --> 21:43.920
some sort of signal has been picked up emanating from this planet and they go down to investigate and a rather

21:43.920 --> 21:58.260
gruesome, very non-benevolent alien is brought on board and the alien systematically starts dispatching the crew and also

21:58.260 --> 22:07.840
using the crew as a part of its reproductive cycle. It implants egg inside them and the egg eventually forms a pod and the

22:07.840 --> 22:15.740
pod sits around waiting for some other life form to come by and when the other life form comes by it implants itself inside it and

22:15.740 --> 22:27.920
then furthers implants an egg inside that life form, in this case being a human life form, and the egg matures further and then uses the

22:27.920 --> 22:36.560
life form as food and then breaks out of them and then grows into the adult alien which goes around searching for more life forms

22:36.560 --> 22:48.080
to implant eggs and so on and so on. The thing about this movie which brought it out of the mediocre was its stunning visuals.

22:48.920 --> 22:57.720
It was beautifully photographed and the creature that they devised in this is probably one of the best monsters ever created for the screen.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.220
But on the other hand it's still a bug-eyed monster.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.040
Very true.

23:03.180 --> 23:13.600
The movie you're right, the movie was a fine movie and it was saved by the technology, the visual effects, but as some critics remarked and I totally agree with this, it was really a

23:13.600 --> 23:15.400
jaws set in outer space.

23:15.760 --> 23:20.500
Very true. It was a cross between jaws and star wars.

23:22.300 --> 23:32.240
But still I would say as you mentioned earlier it was an extreme. I mean there are extremes in the treatment of aliens in the movies today and that of course would be the extreme that goes back to the bug-eyed

23:32.240 --> 23:32.880
monster days.

23:33.640 --> 23:41.180
And one of the more optimistic movies that has to deal with first contact is of course Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

24:22.540 --> 24:29.860
That being a movie by Steven Spielberg, written by Steven Spielberg and directed by him also.

24:31.480 --> 24:38.240
I think that probably would be considered the classic first encounter movie in Hollywood history.

24:38.440 --> 24:49.380
It incorporates a lot of the elements of first contact that UFO specialists and others interested in first contact on a real basis have been talking about for a number of years.

24:49.380 --> 25:12.720
Yes, it was obviously crafted with a lot of love and attention to detail and it seems to me to be a very passionate work and that he obviously wanted to portray and show something that he held very close to himself.

25:13.260 --> 25:22.880
Well consider what it would be like. To me the movie more than anything else, the details of it, the plot structure, all of this was subservient to one thing and that was the feeling.

25:24.140 --> 25:32.220
What's it going to be like when we actually and truly make first contact with an alien culture? What are we going to feel like?

25:32.940 --> 25:37.740
Now of course one way that the early movies treated that was well they're going to be monsters, they're going to be hostile.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.820
We can't show them where we live if it happens off the earth.

25:41.300 --> 25:51.320
But this movie at the end of it in particular you got a sense of wonder, a sense of fascination, a sense of awe that we have contacted an alien culture.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.040
They are not hostile. What's it going to mean?

25:55.180 --> 25:58.400
It's an opportunity for us rather than something we should be afraid of.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.320
Yes, it's an extremely optimistic ending to the movie.

26:02.220 --> 26:10.780
Now of course the communication in the movie was, if you can call it that I suppose, was sonics or sound or tonal qualities rather than any kind of language or...

26:10.780 --> 26:12.660
Yes they communicated with sound and light.

26:15.700 --> 26:19.140
And the movie is actually done on two levels.

26:19.260 --> 26:31.300
One with the electrical technician working for the power company who had an encounter with an alien craft which transferred this image of where the alien culture was.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.580
And where they were going to land to him.

26:32.760 --> 26:40.660
On the second level it was an international organization which was tracking down possible landing sites.

26:41.480 --> 26:47.420
And using extreme advanced technology was determining where they were going to land, when they were going to land.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.960
They had this all figured out in advance.

26:50.080 --> 26:59.800
And when they finally, or hero convert, finally gets to the area where the craft is going to land.

26:59.800 --> 27:13.460
All these other people from all over the world have also converged on this one spot because they have also had sightings and they've also had this thought implanted in them that something is going to happen here of extreme importance.

27:13.660 --> 27:16.340
So they've all going there to find out what it is.

27:17.080 --> 27:29.000
And once first contact is made and the aliens are actually seen and our people go on board to a journey with them on through space.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.440
The movie ends on just a very, very high note, very, very high optimism.

27:34.240 --> 27:50.220
I think that scene where the principal alien ship lands and the people have prepared for them with the sound and the lights and the interchange, the sound, at first very tentative, sort of timid.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.040
And finally it works up to a huge crescendo.

27:52.040 --> 28:00.560
The looks on the faces of the humans as they realize what they've done here is just, to me, is one of the most beautiful things done in science fiction movies.

28:00.780 --> 28:12.540
Even the military personnel, and you traditionally in the movies see the military as fairly hard people and not willing to go along with this kind of viewpoint, but everybody there is staring up at the mothership in awe and wonder.

28:13.020 --> 28:14.100
It's quite a great feeling.

28:14.100 --> 28:18.360
I can't think of a movie that would be more extreme from Alien than this one.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.200
It's almost totally different at the other end of the spectrum.

28:22.220 --> 28:28.040
You know, the aliens are non-aggressive, they are friendly, they are superior, but they do seem to be benevolent too.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.640
This is Daryl Lane.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.560
Keith Johnson.

28:40.780 --> 28:41.360
And David Carson.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.420
Thank you.
