WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:02.840
Certainly. Is this taping now?

00:03.180 --> 00:07.060
The tape is now on. Anything you say now will be recorded.

00:07.500 --> 00:07.680
Okay.

00:08.140 --> 00:13.100
Mr. Simac, could you give us your background, where you grew up, how you spent your time

00:13.100 --> 00:13.960
as a young boy?

00:14.840 --> 00:24.060
I was born on my grandfather's farm, which stood on the high hills above the confluence

00:24.060 --> 00:33.720
of the Mississippi and Wisconsin River. And I grew up as a farm boy. I went to a rural

00:34.160 --> 00:42.720
high school. We lived in one of the mountains at the tail end of the pioneer period. Most

00:42.720 --> 00:48.480
of us are five families poor and all of our neighbors were poor. We didn't think we were

00:48.480 --> 00:57.800
poor, but we were. We didn't think so because everybody was in the same shape. And I think

00:57.800 --> 01:08.200
a little after high school, I attended a teacher's training course and taught school for a short

01:08.200 --> 01:15.100
time and then went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, but it did not finish there. I

01:15.100 --> 01:21.500
went on a buddy. I got a job in the newspaper and I've been in the newspaper business ever

01:21.500 --> 01:23.680
since until six or seven years ago.

01:26.860 --> 01:27.380
Okay.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.340
How did you decide to become a newspaper man?

01:34.800 --> 01:43.160
I think there was no decision because I think I always knew what I wanted to write. And I

01:43.160 --> 01:49.100
never really thought of writing fiction or writing books or anything of that sort. It

01:49.100 --> 01:57.900
seemed to me that the way to write was to be a newspaper man. My mother, who was a very

01:57.900 --> 02:05.660
well-educated woman, had books in the house all the time and I read them. We thought, despite

02:05.660 --> 02:13.480
the fact that we were poor, we got a daily paper and she used to set the table by the

02:13.480 --> 02:20.500
light of a kerosene lamp and read it each evening after all the work was done. And I

02:20.500 --> 02:29.600
asked her at one time, I remember, if a newspaper printed all the news that work was. And she,

02:30.100 --> 02:37.160
in the manner of that day, and because people were not as cynical as they are now, said

02:37.160 --> 02:45.580
yes, that's true. And I asked her another question that I thought was important. I said, is all

02:45.580 --> 02:52.040
the news true? Is what the newspaper writes true? And again, that lack of cynicism and

02:52.040 --> 02:58.380
faith that the people of that time had, she said yes, it was. And that, she said to me,

02:58.770 --> 03:04.480
decided to be, want to be a newspaper man. How long were you in the newspaper business

03:04.480 --> 03:15.260
before you wrote your first science fiction stories? No, that's quotation. I started

03:15.260 --> 03:28.160
my newspaper career in 1929 and my first short story appeared in, I think, 1931. And

03:28.160 --> 03:35.340
I wrote, at that time, I wrote several other short stories which were published. And at

03:35.340 --> 03:43.580
about that time, the magazine, the all magazines, science fiction magazines and all others, ran

03:43.580 --> 03:51.260
at a hard time because the Great Depression came along. And so I, there was no market,

03:51.260 --> 03:58.940
no pet, no market. So I dropped out and didn't do any more writing, any other fiction writing

03:58.940 --> 04:07.100
of any kind until I think it was 37 or 38. And I started writing again because the magazines

04:07.100 --> 04:15.020
had come back. John Camel had been named editor of a, of a Stelman. And I felt very short

04:15.020 --> 04:23.720
and I could tell my work to John Camel. So I started in again and I think since, since

04:23.720 --> 04:33.860
1938 and 1939, I think it's 38, 37 or 38. There was only one year in which one of my work

04:33.860 --> 04:40.340
appeared. There was one year that's blank and I can't remember which year that it was.

04:40.340 --> 04:48.700
I have no idea why that occurred. When you began writing fiction, what influenced you

04:48.700 --> 05:01.780
to write science fiction? Because when I was a boy, I had read Julius Wern and, and I think

05:01.780 --> 05:07.280
H. G. Wells, although I don't actually remember the H. G. Wells works, but I must have read

05:07.280 --> 05:18.920
them. Like Alan Poe and the Haggard. And I thought what a wonderful thing that was. I

05:18.920 --> 05:25.500
just had no interest in the field. I wanted to read it myself and I found out when I decided

05:25.500 --> 05:31.680
that I wanted to write, when I found out the newspaper didn't give me everything and I

05:31.680 --> 05:39.260
wanted it in the writing field. I decided that on parts that my spare time I write, I

05:39.980 --> 05:44.120
naturally seemed to turn to science fiction because it was something I was quite a wimp.

05:45.220 --> 05:51.620
I felt very short. I could do the job of this. And I was quite fortunate of course because

05:51.620 --> 05:56.920
there was no competition at that time. If you could string three sentences together and

05:56.920 --> 05:58.800
make a paragraph, somebody would play the story.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.880
Did you have any interest in science when you were growing up?

06:07.280 --> 06:16.520
Some interest. You must realize that at that time science was a somewhat different thing

06:17.340 --> 06:23.500
than it is today. Today science is something that a good many people are interested in.

06:24.360 --> 06:30.640
There are a great many engineers and a great many technicians and just ordinary lay people

06:30.640 --> 06:38.060
who are interested in science. But that time science was another elevated situation, elevated

06:38.060 --> 06:45.660
crap. There were a few great scientists. There were a few engineers, but mostly those were

06:45.660 --> 06:55.220
either mining engineers or civil engineers. There had been very little science and very

06:55.220 --> 07:04.900
little pride at that time. And the public interest in that was fairly low. I was taken by the,

07:05.720 --> 07:15.400
I used to read, I think it was magazine, would it be scientific or what, would it go back

07:15.660 --> 07:21.400
far? I think so. I used to read Scientific American which had some marvelous articles

07:21.400 --> 07:27.120
in it, particularly on astronomy. I didn't understand any of it, more understood very

07:27.120 --> 07:33.720
little of it, but the mystery and the wonder of it, they're taught me by the schools. And

07:33.720 --> 07:39.820
that was the sort of interest I had at that time in it. I don't think very many people

07:39.820 --> 07:45.660
had interest in science the way that they can be said to have interest in science today.

07:48.520 --> 07:54.220
You mentioned when you resumed your writing in 1938 when the magazines had recovered that

07:54.220 --> 07:58.320
you thought you could write for John Campbell. What was in your writing that you thought

07:58.320 --> 08:09.800
would appeal to Campbell? I've read a lot of John Campbell's work. And I knew it was

08:09.820 --> 08:21.280
what I knew at John Campbell was favored what we today call hard science fiction. And I

08:21.280 --> 08:26.320
thought that I could write that kind of science fiction. I did write what a marvelous hard

08:26.320 --> 08:31.500
science fiction for some years and then begin to turn it over to the softer science fiction

08:31.500 --> 08:37.200
such most of which were. Well, most people write self-science fiction today, only a few

08:37.200 --> 08:42.100
in the old hands and maybe a few new beginners write the hard science fiction today.

08:46.420 --> 08:53.000
Some people feel that John Campbell influenced science fiction positively. Others feel that

08:53.000 --> 08:57.900
he influenced it very negatively. What's your assessment of his influence on the field?

08:58.260 --> 09:02.860
I think it's that John Campbell probably made science fiction what it is. He was the one

09:02.860 --> 09:11.860
man who stood there and fought for science fiction and directed science fiction. He was

09:11.860 --> 09:16.700
this, you can't take away from John Campbell anything good that has been said of him.

09:17.820 --> 09:24.840
In later years we became rather hype bound with his opinion and a little big tutorial.

09:26.640 --> 09:31.820
And he was a good influence to start with. I think that probably you can see was a bad

09:31.820 --> 09:42.440
influence. But he lost his prestige as a great science fiction editor. I suppose quite a few years

09:42.440 --> 09:48.900
before he died. There were some of the boys that were writing science fiction friends of

09:48.900 --> 09:55.500
mine that posted that they could tell the science fiction story to Campbell anytime they wanted

09:55.500 --> 10:02.620
because they knew exactly what buttons to push. And if they pushed the right button they knew

10:02.620 --> 10:05.500
they'd jamboree the story. He was that predictable.

10:10.460 --> 10:17.940
You stuck to short stories during your early years. Was this because you were full time

10:17.940 --> 10:19.500
employed as a newspaper man?

10:19.500 --> 10:30.560
Well not necessarily but a short story is the training ground for the novelist. You can

10:30.560 --> 10:38.140
learn a lot more from writing a short story than you can writing a novel. It's shorter

10:38.140 --> 10:46.060
to write, somewhat easier to write. You don't have the time invested in a short story to

10:46.060 --> 10:54.660
write a novel. If you spend as a beginner probably six months or a year writing a novel

10:54.660 --> 11:01.060
and it fails when that's catastrophic. But during that same time you could write perhaps

11:01.640 --> 11:16.040
a dozen short stories and if only one of them sold why okay you have made a beginning. So

11:16.040 --> 11:24.900
you can write a long story and that doesn't apply only to the science fiction field but

11:24.900 --> 11:26.500
to any literature.

11:29.640 --> 11:39.820
According to my information in 1944 the first two stories from City appeared. This seemed

11:39.820 --> 11:43.820
like quite a leap from what I should have written in that it has the dogs and the robots and

11:43.820 --> 11:49.120
the men. Could you give us a little bit of background on how you conceived the ideas and put them together

11:49.120 --> 11:49.900
for that series?

11:53.880 --> 12:05.080
It wasn't weak because I always regard the city stories as a sort of watershed in my writing. I have been

12:05.820 --> 12:19.600
writing the early type of science fiction work up until then. And it seemed to me that something

12:19.600 --> 12:28.000
better could be done than was being done. Strangely enough, at about the same time a number of other

12:28.000 --> 12:36.680
people seemed to think the same thing. There's no accounting for something like that happening.

12:39.700 --> 12:57.980
I think it was my disillusioned by the war that made me write the City series. It's a

12:59.740 --> 13:13.180
terrible period in history. Much of human dignity has been shared away. It was not the kind of world that we had lived in

13:13.180 --> 13:23.040
up until that time. I was far myself wanting to retreat from it. So I retreated from it in my

13:23.040 --> 13:31.920
own mental way by going into another dimension, into another world, creating a sort of a fantasy

13:31.920 --> 13:44.620
of myself as it turned out others also were able to find some refuge. I think if the City series

13:44.620 --> 13:51.620
was written today that they probably would not get the attention that they got back in the early 40s.

13:53.980 --> 14:02.880
I wrote them exactly the right type of stories, exactly the right type. Without knowing I was doing it.

14:06.580 --> 14:12.600
The original eight stories, what kind of time span did they cover as far as your writing them?

14:17.120 --> 14:24.800
I don't know, honestly can't tell you. There were eight altogether weren't there?

14:25.820 --> 14:36.140
Yes, I have the first ones. The first seven were written very well one after the other. The eighth and

14:36.140 --> 14:48.820
final one John Campbell turned down because he said he's not that he'd written that he'd published enough of that of the City series.

14:50.420 --> 14:58.140
And so when he rejected it I simply threw it up on the shelf and figured it was one of my rejects.

14:59.880 --> 15:06.160
And then later took it down and I think I sold it to amazing stories.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.960
And I don't recall what they called it but they put it out as one of their horrible titles.

15:17.800 --> 15:24.380
And then later on when it came out, it came out before my, it was, it was, it joined the others.

15:24.380 --> 15:28.220
But it was the last one was not published by Campbell.

15:30.900 --> 15:41.860
I want to jump up in the future now and then we'll go back. But I want to ask you about the ninth city story Epilogue which came out 20 or 30 years after the others.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.540
What's the story behind this one coming out very late?

15:45.540 --> 15:59.820
Well John Campbell died and of course all of us, all of us were taken by his death because even the comparatively young man and appeared to be in good physical condition.

16:02.220 --> 16:12.500
Some of the writers reverenced him. I'm not too sure I reverenced him but I felt very kindly and very, very badly hit by his death.

16:14.180 --> 16:21.580
And a group of the writers got together and said we'd have to put out a memorial to John Campbell.

16:22.500 --> 16:34.400
And the best way would be to put out the last issue of the oldest telling stories, not analog but the oldest telling stories.

16:36.140 --> 16:49.660
And so they asked, I suppose there were dozen or so people who had written for the oldest telling stories to write a story for the memorial wall.

16:50.800 --> 17:01.340
And Harry Harrison who was the editor told me and he said, Cliff if you would write a story I wish you'd write another city story.

17:04.460 --> 17:15.140
And I was reluctant to do that. I shied awake because it had been quite a number of years since I'd written a city story.

17:16.560 --> 17:23.980
And I knew that I had said I was a changed writer but I was not the same man as I was when I'd written the stories.

17:26.320 --> 17:43.020
I worried a great deal about the propriety of writing another city story because I figured that the last one, the last eight had wound up the story of the Webster family and that there was no need going further.

17:44.300 --> 17:54.100
But the more I thought about it the more I began to see that if I was going to write something for that memorial about volume it should be a city story.

17:56.060 --> 18:09.740
So for the first time since I'd written them I took down my copy of the book City and reread it trying to catch the flavor and the spirit of the stories.

18:10.820 --> 18:21.840
And when I read the stories I simply absolutely ached to rewrite them again because there are some awful crudities in them.

18:22.740 --> 18:30.740
But I knew even as I thought about that that I couldn't do it because if I rewrote them they wouldn't be a city series.

18:32.780 --> 18:44.460
So I sat down and did my best to try to recreate the flavor of the other eight stories.

18:45.820 --> 18:51.000
I think I came very close to it but not as satisfactory as I'd wanted to.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.740
Jenkins is the robot that comes to mind from that series.

19:01.240 --> 19:08.820
Your robots differed from a lot of the early science fiction robots in that they were benevolent. They weren't evil beings.

19:08.980 --> 19:12.900
How did this idea come to you as opposed to using evil robots?

19:14.580 --> 19:21.780
According to Isaac, Isaac Asimov there can be no evil robot. He's got his three robotics.

19:22.200 --> 19:31.700
Robotics all. But I don't think there were too many evil robots. A few maybe but not too many.

19:32.780 --> 19:41.920
But the thing was that most of the writers who had written robots before wrote of them as machines.

19:43.540 --> 19:49.160
And I wrote of them as surrogate human beings.

19:51.100 --> 20:01.860
I made them people with some of the biases and prejudices that the living human would have stripped away from them.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.100
And I tried to make them the kind of people that I would want to live with.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.340
To me, the robot was another person.

20:14.700 --> 20:20.880
And the same thing is true with a lot of my aliens. They are people. They are other people. Other persons.

20:25.440 --> 20:30.480
Had you been exposed to Asimov's three laws before you wrote the city series?

20:30.840 --> 20:36.800
Yes. Asimov homogated the three laws quite a number of years before that.

20:38.880 --> 20:44.540
In his earliest robot story he had the three laws.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.120
I don't particularly hold those laws.

20:51.280 --> 20:59.600
And I don't think a lot of other writers would help with the media because we do have miserable robots now occasionally in evil robots.

21:00.400 --> 21:12.380
But by and large the writing fraternity went along with these three laws and your robot still held to the three laws that he had set forth.

21:15.360 --> 21:24.900
There must have been another element from your life in the books because the city collection is dedicated to Scooty who was Nathaniel.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.060
Was he a little dog that your family had?

21:27.060 --> 21:32.240
Scooty was a Scottish carrier.

21:36.280 --> 21:49.940
We lived with him. He didn't live with us. We lived with him for some 13 or 14 years. He was a great dog.

21:55.120 --> 22:02.130
Now I want to jump into the 1950s. You produced a lot of short stories in the 1950s.

22:03.440 --> 22:08.560
I'd like for you to comment on that. The continuing production of short stories as opposed to novels.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.320
And then how was your newspaper career going in the 50s?

22:13.320 --> 22:28.320
I came to Minneapolis. I worked for 10 years in the newspaper field in the small newspaper field with thousands of, tens of 20,000.

22:29.680 --> 22:41.740
I came to Minneapolis in 1939. I came as a copy editor on the copy desk.

22:43.300 --> 22:53.960
In the 1950s I was a news editor. I was responsible for the entire content of the newspaper with the exception of the sports department.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.660
My career was going very well.

23:03.000 --> 23:11.200
By that time we had a family. We had a responsibility to have a family, a house, a car.

23:13.980 --> 23:25.100
There was a long city for writing then, I suppose, and it had been there earlier years because the money was very well.

23:26.760 --> 23:35.100
I was kidding. I'm sorry, but a few thousand dollars a year made an awful lot of difference in the family budget.

23:36.120 --> 23:43.440
So it was an economic consideration. I suppose it kept me writing, although I was never aware of that.

23:43.720 --> 23:51.340
I always enjoyed writing. I never thought of myself as writing for money, but I did keep turning them out.

23:52.500 --> 24:06.760
I suppose at that time I was far more ambitious than I was in later years and was very much trying to become a decent writer.

24:09.940 --> 24:21.980
This is as good a place to ask this question as any. Aren't newspaper writing and story writing almost on opposite ends of the spectrum as far as how you approach the writing?

24:22.100 --> 24:24.560
And how did you manage to juggle both types?

24:24.560 --> 24:40.000
That's easy because they are absolutely upright. But I compartmentalized my life into two lives.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.700
When I went to work in the morning I was a newspaper man.

24:45.920 --> 24:52.120
And when I came home and sat down at my desk at night I was a fiction writer.

24:54.180 --> 25:02.160
I carried that out as opposed to absolute waste because I never mentioned my writing at the office.

25:02.840 --> 25:09.060
When I was outside writing my fiction writing at the office and somebody came and asked me about it,

25:09.200 --> 25:17.840
I talked to them about it the brief ways I couldn't because I wanted to keep the two lives absolutely separate.

25:20.680 --> 25:29.600
It was an unspoken matter of psychology and a mental attitude because the danger was there and I realized it was an danger.

25:30.410 --> 25:49.260
I think however that newspaper writing does not in any way harm the fiction writer because in newspaper writing you do have to write concisely,

25:49.260 --> 25:58.700
and plainly and so simply so if the reader will not only read it usually but will understand it.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.080
And I think that's important in fiction writing as well.

26:06.380 --> 26:12.680
These stories that were written in the 1950s were you I guess it can be said in your maturity.

26:12.680 --> 26:19.000
And various sources that I've read use the following words to describe it.

26:19.080 --> 26:24.960
Gentle, sentimental, pastoral, warm, bucolic, mid-western values.

26:26.700 --> 26:30.020
Does this basically reflect your philosophy of life?

26:31.820 --> 26:37.280
I would not talk about philosophy of life for a moment. Let's talk about technique and craftsmanship.

26:40.480 --> 26:51.180
Every writer writes from his roots and my roots were in the mid-west and in the rural areas.

26:57.940 --> 27:06.180
I'd always lived in the country or in a small town and when we came to Minneapolis in 1939

27:07.540 --> 27:14.480
we lived in the city only long enough to find a home that we could buy in the country.

27:20.100 --> 27:29.880
I began to think of Minneapolis as my city and I still have a great deal of fiction for it.

27:29.880 --> 27:40.500
It's a small town, it's not a large city, it always says to me it was an overgrown village.

27:42.100 --> 27:52.260
People are friendly, I went down Rock Street through the lunar and I wouldn't go more than a couple of blocks

27:52.260 --> 27:58.580
because before somebody would speak to me my name, maybe stop chatting for a while, it's very friendly place.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.760
And I liked it but I didn't want to live in it.

28:07.120 --> 28:14.760
I don't know about the philosophy.

28:18.480 --> 28:29.520
The man's last baby is so much a part of him that he probably doesn't stop and think about it very often.

28:31.220 --> 28:37.940
He doesn't say, well this is, I'm writing this way because this is the way I think or this is the way I feel.

28:39.220 --> 28:51.240
When you sit down and write, you're writing the way you think and you feel unconsciously without trying to work at it.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.780
Does that make any sense or am I just fumbling around?

28:56.140 --> 28:59.080
That sounds great to me, that really does.

28:59.640 --> 29:07.760
In fact, this is just a comment but I think it's those adjectives that I use that make your writing very popular.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.320
It's nice that you feel that way.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.180
Let me ask a question now.

29:15.980 --> 29:28.220
There are some writers in Ray Bredberry is the one that comes to mind most who use this kind of Midwestern scenery imagery as just a veneer for something that's covering evil.

29:28.220 --> 29:34.560
Whereas you very seldom have somebody in your works that are really, somebody that's really evil.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.280
We just don't see it that much.

29:37.880 --> 29:46.060
Do you just not worry about that or let the other writers handle the evil things and you'll handle these more gentle kinds of situations?

29:48.180 --> 29:54.360
I have never, I think I've never been aware of evil.

29:56.200 --> 30:09.320
I have been aware of friendship and love and good fellowship and honesty too.

30:11.400 --> 30:19.420
I get very concerned at times about the condition of the world, not only now but in times past.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.460
And I know that there is evil.

30:24.140 --> 30:34.800
But I kept at that time, not consciously but simply because I guess I didn't want to think about it.

30:36.720 --> 30:41.640
I concentrated on this because I said before on the things that seemed important to me.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.940
Once again I'm tumbling around.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.600
I'm not doing a very good job.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.980
That's the kind of job you probably like.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.020
But I can't say much more about it.

30:54.980 --> 30:59.940
Now everybody that's listening thinks this is quite interesting so you are not rambling.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.680
We'll ask one more question then we'll run out of tape on this side.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.000
Then there are just a few more questions.

31:07.620 --> 31:11.540
In the 1960s you began producing a lot of novels.

31:12.660 --> 31:18.860
Did you find your stride as far as getting your reputation and getting your foot in the door and then move to the novels?

31:19.100 --> 31:20.880
Or why did you decide to make this move?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.580
I didn't consciously decide to do it.

31:25.620 --> 31:38.660
Simply by the natural progression of events I came to a point where I felt a need to write novels.

31:39.140 --> 31:46.500
Or maybe felt that I was finally a good enough writer, a good enough fast man to write a novel.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.480
It really came quite naturally.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.220
I didn't strain to do it.

31:55.560 --> 32:05.500
I began to find, I think the best way to explain it is that I began to find that I set down to write a novelette.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.820
And it would turn into a novel.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.460
It's just the way it works.

32:16.540 --> 32:20.840
I didn't decide that I'd change from short stories to novelettes,

32:21.000 --> 32:24.060
nor that I'd change from the novelette to the novel ring.

32:24.700 --> 32:26.460
It's simply the way it worked out.

32:28.660 --> 32:32.540
And of course it was, once I wrote a few novels,

32:34.000 --> 32:38.920
I began to see that this is where you could make more money,

32:39.080 --> 32:44.980
that there was more economics in the novel than there was in a handful of short stories.

32:46.980 --> 32:48.380
Thank you.
