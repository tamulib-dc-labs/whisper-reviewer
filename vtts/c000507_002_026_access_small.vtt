00:11.520 --> 00:18.740
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.740 --> 00:20.960
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.500
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.300
The subject matter of the present show is early science fiction.

00:36.460 --> 00:40.100
What one identifies as early science fiction, of course, depends upon what his definition

00:40.100 --> 00:44.760
of science fiction is. If you want to call any literature a fantastic nature of science

00:44.760 --> 00:49.560
fiction, then you'd have to go back to the beginning of human expression. Consider stories

00:49.560 --> 00:54.160
of God's creation myths and early religions of science fiction, but we're not going to

00:54.160 --> 00:58.640
go back that far. It's more useful to place the origins in science fiction, I think, much

00:58.640 --> 01:04.260
further forward in history, at a time when the word science means something, and when

01:04.260 --> 01:08.100
the naivete and superstitions of the ancient world have mostly given way to a truer, more

01:08.100 --> 01:12.820
modern sense of reality. But to get to the present or further forward in history, we'll

01:12.820 --> 01:17.200
have to pass over authors like Jonathan Swift, who wrote Gulliver's Travels, and Edgar Allen

01:17.200 --> 01:22.500
Poe, both of whom were considered as writing early science fiction, and move up to 1817,

01:23.080 --> 01:26.420
when Mary Shelley published what many critics would consider the first science fiction novel.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.200
And that book was Frankenstein, and the reason it's considered the first science fiction

01:30.200 --> 01:35.180
novel is that it uses science in the story, in that Frankenstein is a creature who is

01:35.180 --> 01:39.120
built, who is put together out of, I guess you could say, spare parts, and then is brought

01:39.120 --> 01:44.580
to life by its creator. Using the scientific forces of electricity

01:44.580 --> 01:48.840
rather than some magical force that you might find in an earlier work.

01:50.280 --> 01:55.820
But I think Shelley's treatment of material, Mary Shelley, just the way she handled it,

01:55.820 --> 02:00.180
I think qualifies a novel to be one of science fiction. But at the time she wrote it, there

02:00.180 --> 02:06.180
was no real separation between fantastic literature and realistic literature. There was no categorizing

02:06.180 --> 02:11.320
process, and literature was simply literature. The origin of the term science fiction didn't

02:11.320 --> 02:16.700
occur until the 1920s, and for various reasons it began to exist as a separate literary category.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.320
But immediately before that time there were three major writers who had an immense influence

02:21.320 --> 02:27.360
on the field, a Frenchman Jules Verne, an Englishman H. G. Wells, and an American Edgar

02:27.360 --> 02:32.380
Rice Burroughs. Jules Verne was born in 1828 and published

02:32.380 --> 02:35.760
his first science fiction book, Five Weeks in a Blune, in 1863.

02:37.240 --> 02:44.380
A lot of people considered Verne to be a profit for seeing a lot of the technological things

02:44.380 --> 02:49.440
that we have. Actually, I think he was more just a good science fiction writer. He took

02:49.440 --> 02:55.760
a lot of concepts that were on the verge of coming about, things like the electric light,

02:56.740 --> 03:03.500
the submarine and air travel, explorations that were going on. He took all of these elements,

03:04.240 --> 03:11.380
some scientific, some geographical, and physics and other types of scientific accoutrements,

03:11.640 --> 03:18.440
and blended them into an adventure story format. I think maybe this is one of the prime or

03:18.440 --> 03:24.040
primal manifestations of science fiction as a form in itself.

03:24.860 --> 03:29.160
You could almost say that for his own time he would be a hard science fiction writer,

03:29.160 --> 03:32.740
in that almost all of his stories, as you say, they had a great deal of adventure or

03:33.440 --> 03:38.900
reader interest, but they also were based on some sort of scientific concept. Say the

03:38.900 --> 03:44.540
giant cannon in the book From the Earth to the Moon, from which they made a movie. He

03:44.540 --> 03:50.400
goes into long explanations on the acceleration needed to reach the moon, the muzzle velocity

03:50.400 --> 03:57.880
of the cannon to shoot the projectile. Really fairly definite science for his day.

03:59.360 --> 04:04.880
That's true, although some of the science as seen today is, I guess you could call it,

04:04.880 --> 04:10.180
a little dated, his cannon to shoot people to the moon. But many of the things he wrote

04:10.180 --> 04:16.780
were very well thought out, such as in 20,000 leagues under the sea, his extremely powerful,

04:17.100 --> 04:25.160
highly developed submarine that traveled around the world, mostly underwater, harkens to today's

04:25.160 --> 04:30.120
nuclear power submarines. Of course he created an unforgettable character in that book, Captain

04:30.120 --> 04:38.160
Nemo, almost the archetype of the mysterious, powerful scientist who is living by himself,

04:38.480 --> 04:43.360
conducting experiments. I think that fascinates a lot of readers of the book and viewers of

04:43.360 --> 04:47.300
course of the movie too. That's true, he was an extremely well developed character and

04:47.300 --> 04:52.160
more is told about him in the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Mysterious Island.

04:53.280 --> 04:59.840
In Mysterious Island we see a lighter vein of work that Vern was caught up in in a lot

04:59.840 --> 05:06.160
of his earlier works, the Bohemian, Romantic type of castaway on a lost island somewhere.

05:06.700 --> 05:11.520
Robinson Crusoe type stories, there are quite a few of these in his earlier works.

05:13.140 --> 05:17.800
Yeah, that book in a way reminded me of Robinson Crusoe, the way that these castaways are able

05:17.800 --> 05:24.200
to master their environment and save themselves with their inventions. Another book in that

05:24.200 --> 05:28.720
vein, that kind of light vein, was a very little known work of Vern's, Dr. Ox's experiment

05:28.720 --> 05:35.880
in 1874. It's sort of a farce, he predicates a story where a scientist accidentally injects

05:36.560 --> 05:41.740
some sort of super oxygen mixture into a town and accelerates life where everybody suddenly

05:41.740 --> 05:48.000
is accelerated into a faster pace of living. Around that time too he published off on a

05:48.000 --> 05:53.080
comet. A comet collides with the earth, it just happens to carry off a little portion

05:53.080 --> 05:56.360
of the earth with our heroes on it, they happen to be playing chess, they're carried off.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.720
Sooner or later they get back to earth, the comet comes back and gets near earth, they're

06:00.720 --> 06:09.940
able to sort of jump back on through a balloon. This sort of goes back to some earlier things,

06:10.480 --> 06:15.660
earlier types of fantastic fiction that were written called, I guess for lack of a better

06:15.660 --> 06:21.820
term, fantastic voyages where people go off on marvelous adventures like in his Around

06:21.820 --> 06:26.800
the World in 80 Days where they travel around the world by various means in an 80 day time

06:26.800 --> 06:33.700
period which for them was very, very quick. In his Off on a Comet where they travel off

06:33.700 --> 06:38.080
of the earth because the comet collides with the earth and part of it is broken off. And

06:38.080 --> 06:43.200
also in his story from Earth to the Moon where we travel from the earth to the moon

06:43.200 --> 06:49.460
via a projectile shot from a cannon, all these have fantastic voyages in them which really

06:49.460 --> 06:52.320
go back to a little earlier period of fantastic fiction.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.600
Yeah, that's the category I think that a lot of Verne's fiction can be put in, the fantastic

06:56.600 --> 07:02.700
voyage, the wonderful journey, something like that. Some of his later work is interesting

07:02.700 --> 07:09.600
to the book in the early 1880s, The Steam House where he seemed to have extrapolated

07:09.600 --> 07:15.900
a house trader which is pulled by mechanical elephants powered by steam which is sort of

07:15.900 --> 07:21.860
an interesting idea. And also in the mid 1880s a book called, Robber the Conqueror, in that

07:21.860 --> 07:27.760
book he did for helicopters or huge helicopter like airplanes what he did for submarines

07:27.760 --> 07:30.880
in 20,000 leagues under the sea but he did it for the air.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.640
Jules Verne brought his character, Robber, back in the novel Master of the World where

07:36.640 --> 07:41.920
he depicts science and his main character is a little more sinister than he had in some

07:41.920 --> 07:47.600
of his earlier work where the character is somewhat malevolent and science is not being

07:47.600 --> 07:54.220
used for the good of mankind or at least for the benefit of mankind but is being used for

07:54.220 --> 07:55.480
that one person's own gain.

07:56.900 --> 08:02.960
In fact it seems like he sort of enjoyed toying with this concept in his later works. I think

08:02.960 --> 08:08.180
there was one story even where he pitted a good outcome of science versus a bad outcome

08:08.180 --> 08:14.560
of science and it seems like a lot of his later works are darker, more thoughtful about the

08:14.560 --> 08:17.320
future of science in realistic terms.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.020
Any moviegoer of course would recognize the fact that a lot of Verne's more popular novels

08:41.020 --> 08:45.720
have been made into Hollywood movies. Five weeks in a balloon for instance was a well

08:45.720 --> 08:50.280
known production from one of Verne's books. Around the world in 80 days of course is a

08:50.280 --> 08:56.660
classic of filmmaking. Twenty thousand leagues under the sea done by Walt Disney of course

08:56.660 --> 09:02.520
is a favorite especially with the kids. A Mysterious Island was another that was made

09:02.520 --> 09:03.080
into a movie.

09:04.760 --> 09:10.580
Yes, especially after the copyrights on Verne's works ran out around 1950 I think there was

09:10.580 --> 09:16.520
a flurry of the movies of his works. One of the favorites I think of a lot of people

09:16.520 --> 09:23.380
is Journey to the Center of the Earth. It was a milestone I think in the cinema in terms

09:23.380 --> 09:24.600
of science fiction movies.

09:26.220 --> 09:31.080
It had a lot of on location shooting and a lot of very extravagant special effects and

09:31.080 --> 09:36.240
sets which really was one of the milestones of making at that time.

10:09.580 --> 10:13.820
You could probably say that Jules Verne was the most popular and prolific writer of his

10:13.820 --> 10:21.240
day. He wrote through the 1860's, 1870's, 1880's. He contributed much to the delight

10:21.240 --> 10:27.340
of Europeans in science and technology. And probably what one critic said of Verne is true

10:27.340 --> 10:31.360
that he was the first science fiction writer to make a living at the job and I don't think

10:31.360 --> 10:35.040
science fiction would have been the same had it not been for the influence of Jules Verne.

10:36.300 --> 10:40.300
There are many other people writing speculative fiction or science fiction during this period

10:40.710 --> 10:44.760
but the next major writer was H.G. Wells who was born in 1866.

10:45.780 --> 10:50.160
Yeah, Wells I think adds something to the field that Verne didn't spend much time with.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.800
Wells can have just as much science and as much extrapolation as Verne did but I think

10:54.800 --> 11:01.020
he adds some social criticism. He seems to ponder more on the social ramifications of

11:01.020 --> 11:05.780
the inventions and things he talks about. For instance, his first great success in 1895

11:05.780 --> 11:11.420
was the time machine in which he pictures a far future society which is not always the

11:11.420 --> 11:17.360
positive place. So Wells was I guess you could say making a comment on Victorian England

11:17.360 --> 11:22.580
with the Morlocks who were sort of I guess you could say the working class and the Eloy

11:22.580 --> 11:26.580
who were the upper class and the strife and turmoil between the two different classes

11:27.140 --> 11:33.620
only extrapolated into a far and rather grim future that he had speculated in his book

11:33.620 --> 11:37.400
The Time Machine. Of course another one the War of the Worlds written a few years later

11:37.400 --> 11:42.180
is one of the classic first contact novels and even though humanity came out okay it

11:42.180 --> 11:45.960
was still not a it was a scare book it was not a pleasant book by any means.

11:46.320 --> 11:52.480
And it's amazing the impact this novel has had on science fiction in general that being

11:52.480 --> 11:57.440
the creation of the first of the the bug-eyed monsters and science fiction and science fiction

11:57.440 --> 12:02.560
films have been full of them ever since. Yes many films have been made of Wells works

12:02.560 --> 12:07.920
as well as Verne's works War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, The Time Machine that we've

12:07.920 --> 12:12.580
mentioned also First Men in the Moon was made into a movie that's another of his novels.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.440
As was the Island of Dr. Moreau which if I recall was a extremely negative movie where

12:18.440 --> 12:23.100
this I guess you'd call him a mad scientist is trying to make men out of animals and has

12:23.580 --> 12:28.240
all sorts of creatures which are half and half a very scary negative book I think of

12:28.240 --> 12:34.900
the misuse of science perhaps. Yes and also Food of the Gods is made into a motion picture

12:34.900 --> 12:40.920
based upon that book and one of the most interesting of Wells's work made into a motion picture

12:40.920 --> 12:45.760
was Things to Come based on his book Shape of Things to Come and he wrote the screenplay

12:45.760 --> 12:50.400
for the movie. That's characteristic of a lot of his work The Shape of Things to Come

12:50.400 --> 12:54.840
where you have some sort of holocaust or war where people are destroyed and for a long

12:54.840 --> 12:58.500
time civilization well there is none it's a primitive world and out of that primitive

12:58.500 --> 13:05.620
world some band of scientists or some heroic far-seeing people take over and bring humankind

13:05.620 --> 13:10.000
back to where it should be it's sort of a oh ending ending up I guess you'd call it

13:10.000 --> 13:14.020
almost a utopian book because it does have a positive ending. It's one of the the first

13:14.020 --> 13:19.620
I guess we could say the first science fiction cataclysm novels too. Even at the time of

13:19.620 --> 13:25.220
the making of the movie Wells knew that some of his inventions such as the cannon that

13:25.220 --> 13:29.620
shot the ship into space was already out of date but they went ahead and used him anyway

13:29.620 --> 13:35.020
because they're already a familiar figure used in literature. Oftentimes when Wells

13:35.020 --> 13:39.160
envisioned the future as we remarked earlier he would present a negative picture of a future

13:39.160 --> 13:44.000
society that was the case in the book when the sleeper wakes. You have a Rip Van Winkle

13:44.000 --> 13:49.260
type who wakes up after two centuries and he wakes up into a world which is a dystopia.

13:51.020 --> 13:56.240
Portion of it is useless rich people. Another portion is the mistreated poor. He's very

13:56.240 --> 14:00.920
disillusioned when he wakes up into that sort of dystopian society. And also even in his

14:00.920 --> 14:05.860
more popular work such as the Invisible Man oftentimes the scientific gimmick or the science

14:05.860 --> 14:12.360
he has in the work is used for selfish reasons. In the Invisible Man if you remember the man

14:12.360 --> 14:17.180
is not happy with his invisibility. It's almost as if Wells is saying if you wish for great

14:17.180 --> 14:21.420
powers or if you wish for great abilities or science gives you something great you may

14:21.420 --> 14:24.620
have to pay a price for it. You might be sorry as the Invisible Man was.

14:24.920 --> 14:31.900
And in both Wells and Verne's work there was something I guess of the Victorian era in

14:31.900 --> 14:37.320
there in that both of the writers seem to say at certain times that there are certain

14:37.320 --> 14:42.900
things that man should not dabble with. Man should not play God. And this is brought forth

14:42.900 --> 14:47.880
rather graphically in the Invisible Man where he ends up ultimately dying from him.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.340
Be careful what you wish for you may get it. Right. Sort of an attitude.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.080
I think of Wells and Verne both. The reason that they can be considered early science

14:57.080 --> 15:01.800
fiction writers too is that science was really coming into its own. You know the technology

15:03.360 --> 15:07.200
was advancing rapidly and all sorts of things were happening. It was a very exciting time

15:07.200 --> 15:11.300
at the end of the 19th century the beginning of the 20th. And a lot of that excitement of

15:11.300 --> 15:12.940
course is turns out in the science fiction.

15:30.860 --> 15:36.060
There are many people writing during this time that were writing I guess what you could call lost

15:36.060 --> 15:41.860
world type novels. Probably one of the most well known is H writer Haggard Shee which was

15:41.860 --> 15:47.600
written in 1887. And another author who started writing along these same lines of I guess you

15:47.600 --> 15:52.520
could call fantastic fiction more than science fiction would be the American writer Edgar

15:52.520 --> 15:59.120
Rice Burroughs. Right he got his start or at least his beginning fame around 1911 when

15:59.120 --> 16:03.720
he started to write some stories about a character named John Carter. The first one was titled

16:03.720 --> 16:09.800
Under the Moons of Mars. Probably besides his Tarzan work John Carter may be his most

16:09.800 --> 16:13.860
most famous character. You'd probably have to call that heroic fantasy I think.

16:15.980 --> 16:21.320
There is not a lot of science in it. John Carter gets to Mars simply by wishing to be there.

16:22.320 --> 16:27.600
And when he's on Mars many of the apparatus which fly through the sky and stuff like that are

16:27.600 --> 16:34.080
powered by rather mysterious elements like the Eighth Ray of Barsoom and various things. But it's

16:34.080 --> 16:40.760
it's a wonderful imaginative fiction very vivid images that Burroughs creates and a very very

16:40.760 --> 16:46.980
unique environment. Yeah Burroughs is a natural storyteller. He may not have perhaps he hasn't

16:46.980 --> 16:52.420
worn as well as Wells and Verne have with with serious science fiction readers but he was a

16:52.420 --> 16:57.120
great storyteller. He could use vivid images. There are a lot of space opera elements in his

16:57.120 --> 17:02.600
work especially the John Carter material with with Fair Maidens having to be rescued by great

17:02.600 --> 17:08.840
heroes and bug-eyed monsters and alien environments with different colored moons and and all sorts

17:08.840 --> 17:15.060
of things. Great ingenuity he exercised in his works and I think he also was one of the first

17:15.060 --> 17:20.040
writers to start inventing languages and cultures and maps to go along with his created world.

17:20.180 --> 17:24.900
The Barsoom I think is what he called Mars wasn't it? That's true. He did detail out how the planet

17:24.900 --> 17:30.080
was as least as far as we knew at that time how the planet was set up and what the canals were

17:30.840 --> 17:36.620
and the different types of creatures and peoples that lived on Mars and their various cultures.

17:37.680 --> 17:43.820
He's created probably some of the most elaborate and most memorable characters that have ever been

17:43.820 --> 17:51.720
created as far as heroes go. I mean his heroes are larger than life almost supermen Tarzan is

17:52.440 --> 17:56.800
a character known throughout the world. Movies have been made about him incessantly.

17:56.800 --> 18:03.640
They're working on some new ones now. He just has written some extremely vivid material.

18:04.280 --> 18:10.720
I think with the background that we've seen in Vern and Wells works with the with boroughs we

18:10.720 --> 18:18.400
begin to see the blend of the different kinds of styles that would later evolve into the real solid

18:18.400 --> 18:24.920
pulp fiction pulp science fiction that we see in the 20s and 30s of America and Europe.

18:24.920 --> 18:30.360
Right there's no real convincing science in it. It's just a great story with a

18:30.360 --> 18:34.840
with a lot of vivid imagination in it and something that readers can follow but there's just enough

18:34.840 --> 18:39.140
explanation for you to uh oh I don't want to accept it to want to believe it.

18:39.600 --> 18:46.020
And he wrote many of these series books such as Tarzan and John Carter of Mars and Carcina

18:46.020 --> 18:51.500
Venus and the Pollucador series. Some of his later work which is also popular with readers

18:52.020 --> 18:56.840
though not as well known of course as John Carter Tarzan is at the Earth's core published around

18:56.840 --> 19:02.800
1914 the Moon Maid in the early 30s and another one I think that was made into a movie The Land

19:02.800 --> 19:09.960
that Time Forgot published in the mid 1920s. Boroughs also wrote many other types of works

19:09.960 --> 19:15.840
such as Westerns and I guess what you could call a straight romance but he's most well known for

19:15.840 --> 19:19.020
his science fiction and science fantasy stories.

19:34.060 --> 19:41.000
It was in 1926 that fantastic literature began to separate from the literary mainstream. In that

19:41.000 --> 19:46.700
year a man named Hugo Gernsback began publishing a pulp magazine called Amazing Stories. The

19:46.700 --> 19:51.700
mast head of the magazine contained the word scientific fiction Gernsback's coinage. He defined

19:51.700 --> 19:57.060
what he meant by it by scientific fiction I mean the Jules Verne H.G. Wells Edgar Allen Poe type

19:57.060 --> 20:03.020
of a story a charming romance intermingled with science fact and prophetic vision. It wasn't

20:03.020 --> 20:07.560
until a few years later that the term scientific fiction was changed to science fiction.

20:08.340 --> 20:13.420
And one of the important things that happened at this time was that the American publishing

20:13.420 --> 20:19.620
industry sort of naturally categorized itself into into sections in which there were magazines

20:19.620 --> 20:24.540
that were devoted to different categories like there were there were magazines devoted to sports,

20:24.840 --> 20:29.640
to war, to aviation, to adventure, to electronics and of course to science fiction.

20:31.040 --> 20:36.120
Science fiction had its own magazines now. Gernsback's Amazing Stories was simply the first

20:36.680 --> 20:41.440
and from then until now science fiction has had its own niche. One of the early authors'

20:41.600 --> 20:46.900
soul stories to Gernsback and Amazing Stories was Jack Williamson. He traveled in the early part of

20:46.900 --> 20:52.700
this century to what was then New Mexico territory. He arrived in a covered wagon. When in his teens

20:52.700 --> 20:56.800
he began to read and write science fiction he's still living and writing high quality works.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.760
He spoke to the science fiction radio show about his origins as a writer and about what it was like

21:01.760 --> 21:08.340
to write for the early pulp magazines. Well I grew up on a sand hill farm in the south part of this

21:08.340 --> 21:18.020
county when times were pretty grim and I well wanted to be some sort of scientist without any

21:18.920 --> 21:26.060
direction or means to get a scientific education and a few months after Gernsback started the

21:26.060 --> 21:32.640
Old Amazing where I came across some copies of it and I was immediately fascinated with

21:33.540 --> 21:39.700
experiments that worked with travel and time and spaceships to other worlds and

21:40.420 --> 21:46.560
all sorts of wonderful things and it's been an important share of my life ever since.

21:47.440 --> 21:53.080
At that time he was under the influence of fantasy writer A. E. Merritt who was noted for his overly

21:53.080 --> 22:00.980
descriptive lush prose style. That time I was infatuated with Merritt. I haven't reread him for

22:00.980 --> 22:08.820
many years lest the spell be gone but the first stories I wrote well were full of these attempts

22:08.820 --> 22:16.860
that had purple color illustrated with too many adjectives and later I began to try for

22:17.440 --> 22:21.720
more convincing settings and stronger characters and fewer adjectives.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.740
He sent a few of these early stories into Hugo Gernsback's Amazing and didn't find out that one

22:27.740 --> 22:31.960
of them the metal man was accepted until he saw an issue of the magazine with an illustration from

22:31.960 --> 22:38.720
his story on the cover. I wrote these stories on an old Remington basket model typewriter

22:38.720 --> 22:43.840
and a purple ribbon and two or three of them came back one of them was with a misspelled

22:43.840 --> 22:50.580
writing the title and the metal man never did come back and I was over at Canyon, Texas walking by

22:51.180 --> 22:59.500
a newsstand one day and I saw my metal man on the cover of Amazing and it was quite a thrill.

23:00.740 --> 23:05.180
He remembers the close identification and sense of community. Early science fiction

23:05.180 --> 23:10.200
writers felt among themselves and talks about the categories of magazines published in the 1920s.

23:10.910 --> 23:18.160
The science fiction world has always been a sort of special community where we I suppose we felt

23:18.160 --> 23:23.240
we had our own special handle on science and the future and the shape of things to come and

23:23.960 --> 23:31.000
though I didn't see other science fiction people very often I read their stories and read letters

23:31.000 --> 23:41.440
in the magazines and so forth. In those days before the paperbacks and before TV and before

23:41.440 --> 23:48.340
the comics my people read a lot more for entertainment than they do nowadays and there were really three

23:48.340 --> 23:54.600
sorts of magazines there were the quality magazines like Harper's and those Scribner's Atlantic for

23:54.600 --> 24:01.860
people with brains and the slicks printed printed on coated paper that would take good

24:01.860 --> 24:07.620
advertising for people with money to spend and the props for people who hadn't neither brains

24:07.620 --> 24:15.500
no money but we had a lot of fun in the props even if we were looked down upon widely and

24:16.820 --> 24:24.180
eventually why science fiction got recognized as being not entirely without brains let's say

24:24.600 --> 24:31.000
and nowadays there's a little bit of money in it sometimes. The term pulp refers to a cheaply

24:31.000 --> 24:35.280
printed magazine done on rough paper heavy and acid content with colorful attention getting

24:35.280 --> 24:39.700
covers. Williamson recalls that a dedicated pulp writer could earn a decent living if he worked

24:39.700 --> 24:47.000
very hard at it. Greensbark paid a half a cent a word or less which meant well you get 25 dollars

24:47.000 --> 24:54.860
for a short story and 75 for a novelette but Clayton paid two cents a word and up

24:55.560 --> 25:02.080
which is one reason maybe the Clayton magazines weren't bankrupt in the Great Depression but

25:02.080 --> 25:12.820
that meant that I could pound out 4,000 words a day for two days and earn 160 bucks which was a

25:12.820 --> 25:19.880
fabulous feat for a farm kid in depression days. According to Williamson, Greensbark didn't always

25:19.880 --> 25:24.560
print stories heavy with science. He was in business to interest readers and it took stories full

25:24.560 --> 25:32.660
of adventure for that. He preached a gospel that science fiction was sugar coated science that

25:32.660 --> 25:41.280
it was education and he got a whole panel of experts with degrees that were supposed to vet

25:41.280 --> 25:48.780
the science and science wonder stories when he started that but actually I think that was as much

25:48.780 --> 25:59.420
for well to impress the readers as anything else because he he did use true science in his stories

25:59.420 --> 26:06.880
when he could get it but he also printed a lot of stories that were pretty wild. I think always in

26:06.880 --> 26:12.560
the magazine the adventure element was more important than the science. The readers of

26:12.560 --> 26:17.240
pulp magazines took an active interest in the material being published. They would write letters

26:17.240 --> 26:22.380
to magazines such as Amazing with comments and suggestions. This created a sense of fellowship

26:22.380 --> 26:28.160
among readers and was the beginning of science fiction fandom. Of course I didn't know many people

26:28.160 --> 26:35.140
in the locality who read science fiction but in those days the backs of the magazine were filled

26:35.140 --> 26:41.220
up with letters and tiny type from readers and that was the principal reader response.

26:42.120 --> 26:47.500
I think the editors favored them because they didn't have to pay for the letters and they were

26:48.440 --> 26:56.400
well interesting to us and I used to write them myself as well as read them. It was the beginning

26:56.400 --> 27:02.180
of fandom I suppose. A term that is used to describe much of this early pulp science fiction is

27:02.180 --> 27:07.240
space opera. Some present day readers and writers look down on space opera but Williamson disagrees.

27:07.760 --> 27:12.940
I've never objected to space opera. I still think it's wonderful and I even think that

27:12.940 --> 27:18.400
Star Wars could have been made out of my legion stories as well as it was from something else.

27:18.640 --> 27:26.640
I enjoyed Star Wars tremendously as a sort of adolescent daydream and well the pulp readers

27:26.640 --> 27:37.080
were mostly young and as naive as I was and the space opera was a sort of symbolic escape from

27:37.740 --> 27:43.760
all sorts of things. The pulp era of science fiction didn't last. It faded out into the golden age

27:43.760 --> 27:48.760
of science fiction when large publishing houses started issuing novels in paperback form. Williamson

27:48.760 --> 27:53.740
thinks that there were reasons for the extinction of the pulp tradition. Probably. I was growing up

27:53.740 --> 28:00.600
and the readers were growing up. That's something that's been going on in science fiction at least

28:00.600 --> 28:07.120
in American science fiction all along. I think you can draw a distinction between let's say

28:07.120 --> 28:13.380
European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand which has always been recognized and treated

28:13.380 --> 28:23.080
as literature and the pulp American science fiction which was looked down on but as the readers of

28:23.080 --> 28:30.040
that grew older some of them started writing some of them started editing magazines most of them out

28:30.040 --> 28:37.380
grew science fiction but some of them didn't so there was a continual increase in the education

28:37.380 --> 28:45.940
the sophistication and so forth of the whole field maybe you call it a diversification because

28:45.940 --> 28:52.020
there's still a readership for Edgar R. S. Burris and Robert E. Howard and whatever but

28:52.560 --> 29:00.000
there are also people who let's say former fans who are now academic fans who are teaching science

29:00.000 --> 29:08.040
fiction courses and and writing scholarly articles on science fiction to meet the publisher

29:08.040 --> 29:16.860
Paris test and so forth so that essentially the field is just diversified into all sorts of

29:17.820 --> 29:20.140
levels and areas of interest

29:27.660 --> 29:34.940
