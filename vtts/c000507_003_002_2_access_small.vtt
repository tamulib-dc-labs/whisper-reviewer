00:01.380 --> 00:02.940
Okay, the type is wrong.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.920
Another holy science fiction theme is alternate universes.

00:11.680 --> 00:20.540
And I'm somewhat familiar with the other wheeler-gram, many worlds, interpretation of quantum mechanics,

00:20.660 --> 00:25.000
and then there's the new Richard Gottfielde on how the universe was formed,

00:25.140 --> 00:27.140
and that there might be an infinite number of those.

00:27.140 --> 00:34.600
I guess the problem there is that in either case we could never communicate with these alternate universes.

00:34.740 --> 00:41.900
What are your feelings as a physicist on these theories and on the possibilities of communicating with other universes if they would exist?

00:45.720 --> 00:49.340
I don't think we got a good answer there. Why don't we go on to some else?

00:51.500 --> 00:56.220
I really haven't thought very much about that, so I really don't have anything that I think you could use.

00:57.880 --> 01:04.960
Thanks for admitting that. I struggled over those myself. I thought I was cheating and did somebody else to tell me.

01:06.960 --> 01:13.060
All I'm saying is, unlike gravity where we've got a decent period and it gave us some surprises,

01:13.060 --> 01:21.140
I don't think we really have anything more than science fiction speculations out of the scientists as far as the alternate theory ideas go.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.980
Alternate universe ideas go.

01:24.200 --> 01:35.300
In fact, I just offhand a lot of the ideas I'm hearing in there I would have expected to see in analog first rather than physical review.

01:36.280 --> 01:36.980
Go ahead.

01:40.380 --> 01:58.640
In his book Macro Life, George Zablowski wished you as one of his advisors, what do you think of George's contention that the only way that culture ultimately will survive is to leave the dirt balls and get out into space and wander around?

01:58.920 --> 01:59.400
That sort of thing.

02:01.860 --> 02:08.260
Well, from a very long point of view, it's true. If we stay on this dirt ball, we're going to get swallowed up in a red giant.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.460
So we do have to leave here.

02:13.100 --> 02:24.520
And I think just from watching the way nature works in general is the way a species survives is to settle in more than one place.

02:24.520 --> 02:34.720
And besides, it'd be fun to go out to the stars and explore them, even if we do nothing more than send small colonies out.

02:37.520 --> 02:42.120
Having us in different places, I think would be a very good idea.

02:43.740 --> 02:58.000
After all, England sent out a lot of different colonies and although it could keep in touch with them in times that were short enough so they could get an economic benefit out of us,

02:58.000 --> 03:09.240
I don't think England really ended up richer for settling America in the long run, especially after trying to keep us under some.

03:10.060 --> 03:15.320
They lost the Revolutionary War and so forth, but it ended up with a good friend.

03:17.360 --> 03:36.240
So I expect one way or another that we are going to go out and explore the universe and settle in the universe if we can find enough places that we can settle on without too much difficulty, too much expenditure.

03:36.240 --> 03:54.380
We'll always have scientific colonies out there, of course, but it'd be nice to have a few other cultures, a few other colonies, and they will evolve in a different direction than we will because the environmental pressures will be different.

03:55.340 --> 03:56.620
I think that's valuable.

03:56.620 --> 04:03.100
We cannot assume that just because we've been successful so far that we're going to be successful in the future.

04:08.940 --> 04:13.080
How do you juggle your writing with your full-time position?

04:15.640 --> 04:32.820
Well, basically I write in the evenings and on weekends. I like to read hard science fiction and for a long time I didn't find very much, so I'm having to write it if I want to read it.

04:34.180 --> 04:42.680
Once I got started, I find that I enjoy writing science fiction stories, especially a hard science fiction story, as much as I do reading.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.220
It's basically my hobby out of which I'm making some money.

04:49.480 --> 05:03.760
I don't watch TV and I don't really have any other sports or things that I do. I enjoy writing so much that I do it for a pleasure, not because it's work.

05:03.760 --> 05:19.460
I think one of the things that I really enjoy is when I'm able to put together a world and some aliens and a situation, all of which holds together scientifically.

05:20.800 --> 05:29.280
It's a challenge. It's like trying to solve a research problem of how do you get this, this, and this to work all together.

05:30.680 --> 05:37.040
You have to invent tools, in this case these are imaginary tools, to make the thing come off.

05:37.040 --> 05:49.100
I get just as much eco-satisfaction out of constructing a good world and a good novel.

05:49.320 --> 06:01.640
I think the toughest part, as far as I'm concerned, is doing the final edits, getting the people so that they don't talk scientific jargon, which scientists don't in the real world.

06:01.640 --> 06:11.100
But of course when I write it, I find that most of the characters are spawning jargon and are using things like it is instead of it.

06:11.800 --> 06:18.660
So right now I'm looking at a page here and saying, oh, there is no need to make this a dramatic one-man production,

06:18.800 --> 06:21.700
instead of there is no need to make this a dramatic one-man production.

06:21.700 --> 06:26.840
So most of my editing is cleaning it up from a writing point of view.

06:29.740 --> 06:32.560
But still, you know, it's fun reading it.

06:33.160 --> 06:41.460
And what's kind of interesting, I guess, is a commentary on my own personality is I think I've read Dragon's Egg about ten times,

06:41.840 --> 06:46.740
and every time I read it I still cry at the sad parts. I must enjoy it.

06:50.380 --> 06:58.280
Do you find that the creative process of writing perhaps enhances the creative process of being a scientist and vice versa?

07:02.360 --> 07:12.240
I think that writing is a process of selling science.

07:12.680 --> 07:21.020
I mean, I have always felt that part of my job as a scientist was to try and communicate the first, the facts of science,

07:21.020 --> 07:27.820
and second the excitement of science to the general public that is not involved in science,

07:28.060 --> 07:37.000
because science is at the cutting edge of our intellectual achievements,

07:37.200 --> 07:41.940
whether it's physical sciences, chemical sciences, biological or social or whatever sciences.

07:43.260 --> 07:49.580
This is where we're developing as an intelligent being.

07:50.920 --> 07:57.300
And we're learning more about the world around us and how we operate in that world.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.460
And it's very exciting to be involved in that.

08:00.900 --> 08:05.200
And you don't get much of many scientists admitting that it's exciting, but it is.

08:05.200 --> 08:11.900
I mean, it's part of the reasons you get professors working at wages less than they would if they were a plumber,

08:12.260 --> 08:14.120
is it's more fun to be a scientist.

08:14.440 --> 08:21.680
But most of them are so hidebound and so concerned about their image that they don't want to admit that they're having fun.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.440
Well, I admit I'm having fun being a scientist, and I think it's fun.

08:26.440 --> 08:33.360
I think that's fun and the excitement and everything else can be communicated to the general public

08:33.360 --> 08:43.180
so that their awareness of the fact that they're part of an intellectual and evolutionary advance as an intelligent being

08:44.700 --> 08:47.820
can be given to them.

08:47.920 --> 08:55.540
And I think that's one of the reasons why we have such a spurt of magazines today like Omni and Science 80

08:55.540 --> 09:00.740
and the Smithsonian and others that have, and the Discovery.

09:01.560 --> 09:11.280
All of these magazines are beginning to realize that people want to be part of the leading edge of our cultural evolution.

09:12.320 --> 09:17.600
And I found that I have the ability to communicate that.

09:17.760 --> 09:23.720
Now, for many years, I would only write science articles, not fiction.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.260
I wouldn't have a story.

09:26.520 --> 09:32.120
I just say, here's something interesting I found at the Outskirts of Science, and isn't it wonderful?

09:32.300 --> 09:36.040
Isn't it great? And I'd write it down to whatever level was there.

09:36.760 --> 09:42.880
And those were science speculation articles that I've sold in analog and Omni and places like that.

09:43.480 --> 09:48.120
And I finding that doing it in the form of fiction reaches more people.

09:52.280 --> 09:59.000
How do your colleagues at Hughes Aircraft and then your ex-academic colleagues take to your writing?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.680
Well, it's been a mixed bag.

10:03.680 --> 10:09.240
Some of them have always felt that everything, that all the science I ever did was science fiction anyway,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.000
but those were the mugwumps.

10:14.600 --> 10:23.180
It's very interesting that a lot of people knew me and very well, and were very good friends of mine,

10:24.100 --> 10:26.980
both at Hughes and as scientists.

10:27.900 --> 10:35.040
And the minute that I became a published author, I found them approaching me, of course, with a book in their hand.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.980
And a very different attitude.

10:38.580 --> 10:48.600
It was, oh, you're somebody else now, and you're not the Bob Forward I knew, so I can't just walk up and say, hey, Bob, sign my book.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.840
It was as though I was two persons.

10:55.840 --> 11:09.340
I would find my department manager at one minute talking to me in a manner in which he was dominant.

11:10.040 --> 11:16.520
And then during lunch period, he came by with his book to be autographed, and I found a fan.

11:17.560 --> 11:22.560
He turned a complete turnaround in the attitude of the person.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.920
And it's happened in a number of different cases.

11:26.800 --> 11:39.900
Just an instinct commentary on human characteristics, and also kind of a perturbing commentary on the power of the printed word.

11:40.480 --> 11:49.040
A lot of people that never really used to take me seriously now pay a lot more attention to me primarily because I got a book published.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.040
And it isn't that hard to get a book published.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.080
What do you have in the works?

12:00.260 --> 12:04.620
Unless you find that very useful, let's leave that out. That was a little too ego.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.160
Okay, no problem there.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.780
What do you have in the works? What do we expect from you in the future?

12:13.300 --> 12:23.540
Well, I have a book right now sitting in front of my telephone that's in its final editing stages.

12:23.660 --> 12:32.080
I started it in 1979 and worked on it through 79 and 80 and 81. It's now 82.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.240
And it's about done. You should see it in 83.

12:37.740 --> 12:49.040
This book is called I Call It Ride the Magic Dragonfly because in the book is an airplane that is based on the Mars airplane.

12:49.340 --> 12:57.220
It's designed to fly in worlds which have very little atmosphere like Mars or Titan or something like that.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.980
Well, actually Titan has quite a bit of that.

12:58.980 --> 12:59.420
Sure.

13:01.200 --> 13:08.020
And the setting is around Barnard Star which is about six light years away.

13:09.760 --> 13:17.280
And around Barnard Star are some planets but a very special one. It's called Roche World.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.800
And that's the title my editor wants to use.

13:21.440 --> 13:35.140
The world is named after E.W. Roche, R.O.C.H.E., a French mathematician, that calculated what the shape of a star would be if it was very close to another star.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.220
In other words, two stars rotating around each other.

13:38.340 --> 13:43.400
And it turns out they turn into a figure eight shape or two egg shapes facing each other.

13:44.260 --> 13:56.200
Well, in this case I have two large moons about the size of Titan that are very close to each other, rotating around each other about six hours, period.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.640
And they're not quite touching.

14:00.240 --> 14:05.020
They are the gravity fields pull them into egg shapes.

14:06.180 --> 14:11.980
And the peaks of the eggs, the top of the eggs, are separated by about 80 to 100 kilometers.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.740
But the two planets are so close they share a common atmosphere.

14:17.080 --> 14:22.100
So I have these worlds and the humans are going to go and explore them.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.660
And one of the worlds is a little bigger than the other.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.640
So it ends up with, one of the worlds is a little smaller than the other.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.540
So it ends up with all of the, it is the lowland.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.360
And so it ends up with all of the water.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.680
And so it's completely covered with an ocean.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.280
And the ocean gets pulled up into an egg shape.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.760
So you have a mountain of water with slopes of 60 degrees and a rounded top.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.520
And it doesn't fall down, which I think is interesting.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.460
But that's what the mathematics says will happen.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.880
And not only that, but the gravity varies.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.800
It varies from about a tenth of the gravity near the base of the mountain

14:58.800 --> 15:00.840
to almost zero gravity at the top.

15:01.080 --> 15:07.440
So sea level on a roche world does not mean equal gravity.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.520
This means equal gravity potential.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.380
There's a difference between the gravity potential and the gravity force.

15:15.560 --> 15:19.160
Gravity potential is constant over the mountain, even though it's egg shaped.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.120
But the gravity force varies all over the ocean.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.200
So it's a very interesting world.

15:26.340 --> 15:32.780
And I land the humans on the larger one, which is called roche.

15:33.740 --> 15:37.380
And our reasons to call that is because roche means rock in French.

15:38.700 --> 15:43.960
The other one is the French word for water, which is E-A-U or OO.

15:44.380 --> 15:47.280
Or since the French always put an article in front of it, do.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.380
And I'm not very good at French, but that's the best I can do.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.080
And so we have these two planets rotating around each other.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.460
And in the oceans of one of them are the aliens.

15:59.780 --> 16:04.000
And these aliens are an example of a very intelligent culture,

16:04.980 --> 16:06.880
which does not have any technology.

16:07.780 --> 16:13.860
And now these are modeled along the lines of whales and dolphins,

16:14.640 --> 16:17.000
except that they have another unique characteristic.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.280
They're divisible.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.400
They're way about 10 tons.

16:23.420 --> 16:28.120
And yet their actual cellular structure, their operation,

16:28.480 --> 16:34.180
is more like that of an ant colony than a mammal.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.520
None of all the cells are roughly the same.

16:37.260 --> 16:40.160
And yet as a whole, they're very intelligent.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.560
But any little piece of them is just like an ant.

16:45.060 --> 16:51.260
And so like slime molds or ant colonies, they have an overall structure,

16:51.480 --> 16:55.980
none of which is completely unknown to each little individual element.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.740
And so you can tear them apart, reform again,

17:00.060 --> 17:02.980
or they can be eaten by somebody else, but they don't really get eaten.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.420
They don't get dissolved down.

17:04.420 --> 17:08.840
They just, the little cells get their identity,

17:10.040 --> 17:12.100
excuse me, their allegiance transferred.

17:13.140 --> 17:16.200
So it makes for kind of a different culture because they never die.

17:17.460 --> 17:20.800
The only reason they die, well, they actually never really die.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.280
The only reason they come out and get out of circulation

17:23.280 --> 17:27.060
is that they are much better mathematicians than humans.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.080
And they give themselves research problems to solve.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.880
Then they go off and turn into a solid lump and sit there and think about the problems.

17:37.220 --> 17:41.100
And if they give themselves a problem that takes too long to solve,

17:41.240 --> 17:45.100
then finally they use up all their energy and they sort of dissipate away.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.860
So that's the only way that they die.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.500
Normally they don't do that.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.980
Normally they solve the problems.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.980
So you have creatures that are thousands and thousands of years old.

17:53.980 --> 17:59.160
And we meet them and realize how superior they are in one sense.

18:00.020 --> 18:02.800
Intellectually they're superior, especially mathematically.

18:03.860 --> 18:09.000
But in terms of being able to control their environment, to have any technology, they don't.

18:10.520 --> 18:15.520
So it's an example of a very intelligent creature that we will never find.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.740
With all of the radio searches we'll ever do.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.240
The only way we're going to find those is to go there.

18:23.680 --> 18:27.960
So that's the basic scenario and the basic aliens.

18:28.480 --> 18:34.620
And there's another theme going through the story about the fact that this is a one-way mission.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.460
Humans we send take 40 years to get there.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.420
And by the time they get there they're nearing retirement age.

18:40.760 --> 18:46.140
So basically it's a one-way mission, but it's not a suicide mission.

18:46.140 --> 18:49.560
This is a concept that I've been pushing for quite a while.

18:49.900 --> 18:57.100
And Joan Vinci used it in one of her stories.

18:58.620 --> 19:03.940
And it also has in it the mechanism for getting them there.

19:04.020 --> 19:06.320
And this one uses a laser-pushed light cell.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.420
The idea here is to have lasers in orbit around the sun, collecting lights from the sun, turning into laser light.

19:15.420 --> 19:21.160
And sending it through a very large lens that's 1,000 kilometers in diameter.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.520
And it's easy to make because it's made of pieces of plastic and nothing.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.300
And it's called a Fresnel zone lens.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.720
And this can focus the laser light at 44 light-years distance.

19:32.960 --> 19:39.340
So therefore it can be used to keep the laser light on the sail as we push it towards Barnard star.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.920
Now the question comes, how do you stop?

19:41.920 --> 19:45.760
Well the trick I have is the sail is built in two parts.

19:46.300 --> 19:53.580
An inner central section about 300 kilometers across and an outer section which extends out to 1,000 kilometers.

19:55.180 --> 20:02.340
We take out the inner circular section as we're getting near Barnard and turn it around so it faces the donut-shaped part that's left.

20:03.240 --> 20:08.420
And the lasers from Earth are turned on. Of course they've had to be turned on six years earlier.

20:08.920 --> 20:15.200
And this slug of laser light comes out and hits the ring sail and it keeps pushing that ring sail past Barnard.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.800
It'll leave, we'll lose it.

20:17.320 --> 20:30.020
But during the one year that it's near the Barnard star, the light reflected off the ring sail is focused back down onto the payload sail that contains the humans that is facing the other way.

20:30.780 --> 20:37.780
And so it slows them down and then one year they're brought to a stop at the Barnard system while the rest of the sail goes on the other way.

20:37.780 --> 20:41.200
So this is a way to use a push to get a pull.

20:42.680 --> 20:52.600
And in fact after I invented this idea to get my characters there I realized that I have another scientific paper and so I just finished preparing that scientific paper

20:53.180 --> 20:59.580
which I will present at the AIAA meeting in Baltimore on the 25th of May.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.200
And it's a new way to get to the stars.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.180
And also if you make three stages you can get back again.

21:09.540 --> 21:18.460
So that's another thing that came out of my science fiction writing that I've been able to turn into a scientific paper.

21:18.720 --> 21:22.720
Of course it does. Inventing an interstellar light sail doesn't make you much money.

21:23.940 --> 21:27.280
But one of these days I may think of an idea that will.

21:31.680 --> 21:39.580
The engineer has been sitting here listening to all this and he was inspired to ask a couple of questions so I'll let him go ahead and have the floor right quick.

21:40.080 --> 21:40.340
Okay.

21:40.820 --> 21:45.200
Yeah these are just, oops I'm going to get untangled from my cap cords here.

21:45.200 --> 22:02.140
These are just, have interest to me, I'm attempting with Captain Wray to write some science fiction and I was going to talk to Jerry Pranell about using black holes as power supply and spaceship.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.600
What are your thoughts on that?

22:06.940 --> 22:09.360
Well as a power supply for a spaceship.

22:09.820 --> 22:10.160
Yes.

22:10.400 --> 22:10.700
Okay.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.500
You've been beat out by Arthur Clark.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.680
Did you read Imperial Earth?

22:16.800 --> 22:17.540
Yes I did.

22:18.060 --> 22:21.480
Okay well there was a black hole that ran the spaceship.

22:23.600 --> 22:28.040
Or that the colonists used to come back to Earth with.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.080
And I helped Arthur design that black hole space drive.

22:34.520 --> 22:47.500
Basically a very tiny black hole with a mass about the size of an asteroid, one of the larger asteroids, would be about 10 to the 14th grand if I remember the number right.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.060
But you know it's a large mass.

22:50.400 --> 23:03.020
According to Steve Hawking, the British theorist in gravity, a mass about that size, a black hole about that size would be about the size of one angstrom, about the size of an atom.

23:04.600 --> 23:11.220
Even though it weighed 10 to the 14th grams or 10 to the 11th kilograms or whatever.

23:15.840 --> 23:20.280
And the black hole that size would be white hot.

23:21.500 --> 23:34.940
The reason it's white hot is because it is warping the space around it so much that it pulls particles out of the space and swallows them.

23:34.940 --> 23:44.400
But those particles have partners, anti-particles, or regular particles if the black hole swallows an anti-particle.

23:44.680 --> 23:53.240
And in any case a very tiny black hole acts like it's hot right outside its surface and it meets a lot of heat.

23:54.180 --> 24:03.400
And in fact if you don't do anything to that black hole for a few weeks, you'll get hotter and hotter and then finally it'll explode very rapidly in a very hot explosion.

24:03.400 --> 24:15.820
But if you keep feeding that little tiny black hole food, anything you want, garbage, it'll get, every time you dump something in it, it'll cool down a little bit because it's gotten more massive.

24:16.340 --> 24:22.140
When it gets more massive, it doesn't, isn't as hot. The temperature is inversely proportional to the mass.

24:23.240 --> 24:28.320
So once you've found such a little black hole, you have an infinite source of energy.

24:29.140 --> 24:34.580
All you have to do is keep it fed and don't starve it otherwise it'll explode.

24:35.480 --> 24:41.820
So you can use all this hot plasma coming off from it to do anything you want to.

24:41.940 --> 24:50.600
Run up by spaceship power, the solar system, propulsion, whatever you want.

24:51.180 --> 24:57.100
So a tiny black hole is a very useful mechanism for getting lots of heat.

24:57.100 --> 25:03.860
Now the real problem is it weighs 10 to the 14 tons and if you want to move a spaceship with it, you have to carry it along with you.

25:04.360 --> 25:09.680
So it's not trivial to make a black hole space drive.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.100
Right.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.820
You can hold on to that black hole very easily.

25:16.160 --> 25:23.140
You just make sure that the stuff you feed it is always charged a little positively or a little negatively so that you keep it charged.

25:24.200 --> 25:29.580
And especially out in space, you can hold on to that black hole just using electric and magnetic fields.

25:30.060 --> 25:39.440
In the case of a spaceship trying to use it, the engine room will hold on to the black hole.

25:39.740 --> 25:45.300
The black hole will go where it wants to and you'll ride along with it because it weighs more than you do.

25:46.140 --> 25:46.520
Right.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.860
Anyway, a black hole out in orbit around the Earth would be a very useful energy source.

25:53.900 --> 25:59.900
Question. We can pipe radar signals through pipes like they do in radar installation.

26:01.880 --> 26:06.800
Might it be possible to pipe gravity through some such similar device?

26:08.660 --> 26:15.460
The reason we can pipe radar signals around is the fact that the world has two kinds of electricity.

26:16.380 --> 26:17.480
Positive and negative.

26:18.800 --> 26:24.640
Now the positive particles are the nuclei of the atoms, the protons.

26:25.680 --> 26:31.880
And the negative ones are the electrons that are in orbit around them or if they're in a metal like they are in a wave guide conductor,

26:31.880 --> 26:39.580
they're free to move around even though they always have to stay close to one proton or another, some nucleus or another.

26:39.700 --> 26:46.720
They can't really leave the wave guide or leave the conductor very easily although you can do it if you put an voltage on it.

26:47.780 --> 26:53.260
So when you send a radio wave through a long conductor or through a conductor,

26:53.640 --> 26:58.180
the radio wave is really riding on top of all these electrons.

26:59.400 --> 27:07.180
Now unfortunately there's only one kind of mass that we know of that we have any control of and it's a regular positive mass.

27:07.700 --> 27:20.040
And although they're inside, you know, imaginary mass is allowed by the special theory of relativity and negative mass is allowed by the general theory of relativity.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.160
We have found it.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.040
Anti-matter is not negative mass.

27:25.040 --> 27:32.780
It's just regular mass that has anti-quantum particles, quantum properties, not anti-mass properties.

27:33.720 --> 27:39.360
So we don't have any anti-matter because we don't have any negative matters.

27:39.600 --> 27:48.360
Now if we did, then we could make something like a wave guide or a conductor and we could pipe gravity waves around.

27:48.980 --> 27:56.180
But we don't have it and so until we find a method of making negative matter, we can't use that analogy.

27:57.100 --> 28:07.580
Now back in 1961 I wrote a scientific paper which explained the analogy between electricity, magnetism, on one hand, and gravity on the other hand.

28:08.400 --> 28:24.820
And I showed that the Einstein equations, when they're reduced to elementary things, but still accurately, scientifically, show a great similarity to the equations for electricity and magnetism.

28:24.940 --> 28:33.840
So if anything you can do with electricity and magnetism, you should be able to do with gravity, except some things are not allowed because you don't have negative gravity.

28:34.700 --> 28:43.440
So that your general feelings are right, that you ought to be able to pipe gravity around, but unfortunately we don't have the tools to do with it.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.060
Right, in other words, probably no anti-gravity.

28:48.980 --> 28:59.440
Oh no. You can make a negative electric field using only positive charges.

29:00.170 --> 29:04.320
So you can make negative gravity fields using only positive masses.

29:05.480 --> 29:05.780
Okay.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.640
And you want me to tell you?

29:09.800 --> 29:17.160
Let me just tell you, basically my ships, as they exist right now, they keep changing the way I run.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.760
They may never make it the paper because they keep changing so much.

29:22.020 --> 29:32.620
But apparently they simply lift themselves using the gravity generated by the gravity present in the vehicle, in other words, lifting itself by its own bootstraps, as it were.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.440
Well, you have a momentum problem there.

29:37.400 --> 29:41.220
You may have enough energy to do it, but you violate the law of conservation momentum.

29:42.260 --> 29:44.960
And so what you've got to do is find some way around that.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.720
Now, one of the ways is if you have negative matter.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.340
That's minus m.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.240
And you push it and give it a velocity v.

29:56.420 --> 30:01.380
And its momentum is minus m times v, or negative momentum.

30:02.560 --> 30:09.720
So one of the ways to get around the problem is to say that you're going to convert your positive matter into negative matter.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.400
And then every time you push a piece of negative matter, it comes towards you instead of going away.

30:17.360 --> 30:21.300
And that means that the earth will try and pull on that negative matter.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.640
Oops, I'm wrong.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.200
I forgot.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.320
It pulls on it with a negative force so it won't work.

30:31.420 --> 30:35.400
But no, I'm afraid that one is...

30:37.180 --> 30:44.880
Anyway, it is possible to make negative gravity fields, but it requires a very heavy machine to do it so the machine can't lift itself.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.400
Okay, well, that one's going in the trash can then.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.200
Well, not necessarily.

30:49.660 --> 31:02.640
All you have to do is, you know, as a writer, you're allowed one or two things that are necessary to make the story work.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.620
And are the differences about which you build your story around.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.620
In other words, suppose that you could levitate.

31:11.460 --> 31:13.560
And you have to come up with some kind of plausible mechanism.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.920
Which you haven't done yet.

31:16.300 --> 31:16.560
Nope.

31:18.400 --> 31:23.420
But for instance, you might talk about negative matter.

31:24.460 --> 31:28.680
And the fact that you've got a machine that turns positive matter into negative matter.

31:28.880 --> 31:36.340
Now, negative matter has the instinct property that either tracks positive matter and positive matter.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.640
In fact, tracks all matter.

31:38.640 --> 31:43.620
I mean, negative matter repels all matter, including positive matter.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.460
And positive matter attracts negative matter.

31:45.560 --> 31:53.160
And so if you have a negative matter ball and a positive matter ball side by side, they'll attract each other with a very weak gravity field, not their dense.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.940
But the positive one will attract the negative one.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.880
The negative one will push the positive ones.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.780
They'll both move off in the same direction.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.680
Constantly increasing in velocity.

32:04.940 --> 32:07.260
All of this is in my analog article in 1975.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.860
One of these days I'm going to write an article which uses that as a space drive.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.740
But I haven't done it yet.

32:15.200 --> 32:20.640
And the amazing thing is, is that no law of energy or momentum is violated.

32:20.900 --> 32:26.520
Because if you have a mass moving with a velocity v, it has an energy one half mv squared, right?

32:28.640 --> 32:36.660
And if you have a negative mass moving with the same velocity, it has an energy of minus one half mv squared.

32:36.660 --> 32:46.040
And so therefore, even though you started with two particles that rest with no energy, they both accelerate according to the force laws.

32:46.540 --> 32:51.600
You're not violating the law of conservation of energy because the total energy of the system is zero.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.540
Because the positive mass is gaining positive energy.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.220
The negative mass is gaining negative energy and yet they're both moving.

33:00.100 --> 33:06.300
And if your positive mass is carrying a spacecraft along, your spacecraft along with it, well, you're ahead of the game.

33:07.360 --> 33:13.440
They also don't violate momentum because one momentum is mv and the other is minus mv.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.440
So the total momentum is also zero.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.080
Even though they're both now moving at the speed of light.

33:21.960 --> 33:31.600
So, you know, there's ways to use gravity to get spacecraft propulsion, but you've got to be a little careful how you do it.

33:31.980 --> 33:37.840
Otherwise you can get something that the people don't want to read.

33:38.700 --> 33:43.620
Yeah, I'm going to go back to the drawing board and do a little more work on my spaceship.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.180
Why do you want the spacecraft to run in gravity?

33:48.900 --> 33:52.580
I don't know, what do you want to do with the spacecraft?

33:52.780 --> 33:54.560
Because I can tell you lots of ways to move the spacecraft.

33:55.800 --> 34:00.180
Well, basically, I wanted it to have a relatively...

34:04.920 --> 34:12.840
It appeared to me that a craft that could manipulate its own gravitational forces would be pretty flexible as far as going just about anywhere it wanted to.

34:12.840 --> 34:30.380
So, under normal conditions, you know, landing upon planets similar to ours or similar to Mars, similar to the moon, you know, it would probably have a relatively rapid acceleration rate.

34:30.700 --> 34:35.180
You could travel fairly quickly through the...between points.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.640
Are you going to give it more than one G?

34:39.180 --> 34:39.800
Possibly.

34:39.800 --> 34:45.800
Well, and then what are the humans going to do? Are you going to have an anti-gravity field for them or what?

34:46.180 --> 34:50.360
Yeah, that's what I had the question about piping gravity around.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.500
Supposedly, if I could pipe the gravity around, then I could control it.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.740
If I can't pipe the gravity around, I can't do that. I've got to work up something else.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.640
Well, you know, lots of people have written stories about those kind of machines.

35:01.640 --> 35:08.820
In fact, I think David Brinn's Sun Diver uses something akin to that.

35:08.940 --> 35:13.060
He just, you know, postulates it and doesn't really explain it very well.

35:14.420 --> 35:20.700
But the important thing is he described the effects so well that I let him get away with it.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.980
For instance, what he had is a saucer-shaped object that was going to operate on the Sun.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.960
And he had a central plane that was basically fairly thin and flat.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.540
And everything was attracted toward it.

35:38.440 --> 35:43.300
And so that when you walked around the shell, you immediately turned over and you were talking.

35:43.700 --> 35:49.880
You were upside down and talking. He described it well enough that I was willing to let him get away with it.

35:50.260 --> 35:53.040
Even though I knew it wasn't possible to do it physically.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.660
So I think that's better be what you ought to do.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.360
You ought to come up with a design for the gravity pipe.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.540
Say you've got a gravity pipe, okay?

36:03.180 --> 36:06.920
Don't try and explain to me how it works because you can't.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.860
But explain its effects.

36:11.340 --> 36:16.160
And what it would be like to live in that thing until I'm willing to live in that universe.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.660
Even though, as a scientist, you haven't explained how to make that gravity pipe.

36:21.660 --> 36:22.780
I'm willing to give you that.

36:23.220 --> 36:33.280
But what you've got to do is make the scenery and the effects so weird and yet so consistent and so believable

36:33.280 --> 36:37.920
that I'm willing to stop wondering how the hell does he make gravity pipes?

36:38.260 --> 36:40.100
And that if your story is interesting enough, I will.

36:41.020 --> 36:42.980
Alright, I know what you're...

36:42.980 --> 36:46.760
You've got a basic idea on what you want to do with it.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.840
I think instead of trying to make it scientifically accurate,

36:50.580 --> 36:54.540
you can't, as far as I know, with our present scientific knowledge,

36:56.320 --> 37:03.160
just use the analogies with electricity and magnetism and say that they have been developed in Einstein's theories,

37:03.380 --> 37:09.540
have not been superseded but have been improved on and people found a way to pipe gravity

37:09.540 --> 37:11.260
and they'll try to explain how.

37:11.860 --> 37:18.560
But then describe the effects and what you're able to do with it and do it in a consistent manner.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.520
I don't know what excuse you're going to have in the back of your mind.

37:22.280 --> 37:28.960
But do it in a consistent manner and maybe you'll get something that will allow for what is called a suspension of disbelief.

37:29.140 --> 37:29.500
Is that right?

37:29.700 --> 37:35.120
Yeah, yeah, that's what every good science fiction author aims for.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.920
Unless you write a story that doesn't require any of that.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.700
Right, yeah.

37:43.840 --> 37:50.080
Actually, for instance, in Dragonfeg, the six masses are not quite in a perfect orbit.

37:51.080 --> 37:57.900
And also there's another little problem with Dragonfeg, which a few people have found mentioned to me and I knew

37:57.900 --> 38:03.640
and there wasn't much I could do about it, is that using a heat cycle,

38:04.440 --> 38:13.920
the plants I had on Dragonfeg had a root stuck into the hot soil and used their canopy to radiate heat to the universe.

38:14.420 --> 38:18.140
So they worked between the temperature difference between the hot soil and the cold universe

38:18.140 --> 38:23.080
instead of the hot sun as we do and the evaporation like the plants do here.

38:24.940 --> 38:29.300
If you calculate the amount of energy that could be gotten out of a thermal cycle,

38:30.140 --> 38:33.840
you wouldn't be able to move many nuclear molecules with it.

38:34.200 --> 38:43.860
Basically, it would take something like a thousand years for a plant to develop enough energy to get a pod to nourish one nuclear operating beam.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.160
So the plants are not viable on Dragonfeg.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.880
Everything else is the best one.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.980
I only have one more question.

38:57.780 --> 39:08.020
That's the one on wormholes as a possibility of superseding faster than light travel, getting from here to there in a split second.

39:08.280 --> 39:13.980
Okay. Wormholes are one particular type of space warp.

39:14.700 --> 39:20.580
And I presume you're talking about the John Wheeler wormholes that come out of his geometrodynamic theory.

39:20.580 --> 39:21.180
Yes.

39:22.420 --> 39:28.220
Those wormholes are about 10 to minus 35 centimeters across.

39:31.600 --> 39:41.200
And what's more important is that using the geometrodynamic theory, Wheeler gave his students the problem of,

39:41.380 --> 39:45.600
can you get through a wormhole and out the other side faster than it takes you to go across the top?

39:46.440 --> 39:52.240
And the student proved, no, it's not true. It takes you longer to go through the wormhole and does across the top.

39:54.160 --> 39:59.640
So the wormhole idea is a way of getting from one place to another without going in between.

40:00.640 --> 40:08.680
It uses a theory which is not as good as the Einstein theory because it doesn't seem to predict the right thing,

40:08.780 --> 40:10.840
but it's a self-consistent theory.

40:10.840 --> 40:18.540
In that own theory, people have shown that it isn't a faster than light mechanism.

40:19.500 --> 40:29.580
So, you know, outside of the fact that it's too small to get through, it's not a factor, it's not a speed of light mechanism

40:29.580 --> 40:32.840
because in the very same theory that allows it, it proves it's not.

40:33.520 --> 40:41.980
Now, in the Einstein theory, we have a method for making an entry into a hyperspace, okay?

40:43.340 --> 40:46.920
And we know we can make it big enough to get people through that hole.

40:47.900 --> 40:52.180
Now, what has not been proved in the same theory is that you can make another one somewhere else

40:52.180 --> 40:56.040
and that the hyperspace root is shorter. That has not been proved.

40:56.960 --> 41:00.940
But the fact that you have a method of going into hyperspace is interesting in itself

41:00.940 --> 41:06.100
and the fact that while you're in that hyperspace, you can go back and forward in time is even more important.

41:07.260 --> 41:17.260
And in fact, most people that have studied time travel and space warps have found that if you can do time travel,

41:17.940 --> 41:21.880
then you can make a space warp and if you can make a space warp, you can do time travel.

41:25.280 --> 41:31.960
Time travel is going from one point in time to another faster than you normally would be able to, right?

41:32.520 --> 41:32.700
Right.

41:33.520 --> 41:41.720
And space travel is going from one point in space to another point in space faster than you ought to.

41:42.660 --> 41:46.720
And according to Einstein's special theory, there's no difference between space and time.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.440
So saying one is equivalent to saying the other.

41:50.040 --> 41:50.560
Okay.

41:50.560 --> 41:59.680
So that if you can travel in time and according to the Kermet and the Brandon Carter analysis of the Kermetrick,

41:59.820 --> 42:06.720
you can travel in time and the Tipper time two-way time machine, which is a spinning cylinder of black mass,

42:07.200 --> 42:15.840
black hole density, also allows you to travel in time, indicates that even though we haven't proven in the Einstein theory

42:15.840 --> 42:21.580
that you can go from one place to another faster than in between why they're equivalent.

42:22.160 --> 42:31.020
And so that you probably can one of these days somebody will prove that the Einstein gravity theory allows travel from one point in space

42:31.020 --> 42:32.860
to another faster than speed of light.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.320
Whether you can really do it or not is another matter.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.280
Okay.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.340
That answers both of my questions. I appreciate it very much.

42:42.520 --> 42:43.380
Okay, very good.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.700
Thank you.
