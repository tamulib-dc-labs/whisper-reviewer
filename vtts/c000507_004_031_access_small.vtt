Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.140
And here are your hosts.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.780
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Anne.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.020
One of today's most popular and prolific science fiction authors is Fred Saberhagen.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.360
Saberhagen is best known for two series.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.600
One is a five novel set on Dracula.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.240
The other consists of a novel and over 30 stories on the Berserkers.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.800
As with many other science fiction writers, Saberhagen began by reading it.

01:02.860 --> 01:09.580
When I was very young, when I was eight or nine years old, I came upon this old pulp

01:09.580 --> 01:14.820
magazine, secondhand magazine someplace, and there were a couple of stories and they really

01:14.820 --> 01:15.460
impressed me.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.520
I think they scared the daylights out of me, actually.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.060
And magazines of that kind were prohibited for a while from being brought into the house.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.160
Then I just kind of went away from it for a few years.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.780
When I was about sixteen, I started haunting the secondhand magazine shops, which they

01:36.780 --> 01:44.100
then had in Chicago, and picking up old copies of Astounding, which as it was then called.

01:46.060 --> 01:55.380
And then I didn't really get into writing until later on I was in the Air Force in my

01:55.380 --> 02:00.600
twenties, and I had a lot of time on my hands.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.120
I would make a stab at it now and then.

02:04.260 --> 02:12.160
And still, I guess I didn't have access to a typewriter and all this privacy and so on.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.440
And still nothing really came of it.

02:16.640 --> 02:28.320
And I was in, see I was almost thirty before I actually sat down and seriously wrote a story

02:28.320 --> 02:35.040
and really typed out the manuscript properly and got it, sent it off to be sold.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.540
Saber Hagen has some interesting thoughts on science fiction in its relation to mainstream

02:39.540 --> 02:40.760
or regular literature.

02:41.900 --> 02:46.720
I guess when you say mainstream, I guess I'm coming to think more and more of mainstream

02:46.720 --> 02:56.300
as a kind of an offshoot of writing or literature, whatever you call it, where you're limited

02:56.300 --> 03:03.560
to things that could only happen with a high probability in the next block or in the next

03:04.250 --> 03:05.580
two months or something like that.

03:07.720 --> 03:14.360
And I think if you look back historically, most of the literature has really been wide

03:14.360 --> 03:14.680
open.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.820
You're allowed to use ghosts.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.900
You're allowed to use other planets.

03:20.020 --> 03:22.840
You can do all these things.

03:22.980 --> 03:29.220
We've somehow turned this around and put this in its own little ghetto, but I think it really

03:29.220 --> 03:29.980
should be the other way.

03:31.180 --> 03:36.040
Sometimes the border between mainstream literature, the kind that deals with everyday reality,

03:36.400 --> 03:37.940
and science fiction becomes vague.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.740
Reality can catch up with science fiction quickly.

03:41.580 --> 03:46.340
Saber Hagen uses one of his own books, Octagon, published in 1981, to point this out.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.600
And it's probably as close to a mainstream thing as I've ever done.

03:51.600 --> 04:00.680
It's set in the very near future, and it's largely about computers and programming and

04:00.680 --> 04:02.200
people who play games with computers.

04:04.460 --> 04:10.360
And I guess when I started to write it, it was still science fiction, and by the time

04:10.360 --> 04:14.640
it's published it may be just a little out of date even, I don't know.

04:15.520 --> 04:20.380
Saber Hagen talks about Dracula and the Berserkers, two of his most popular creations.

04:21.560 --> 04:27.260
I think what's got the biggest reader response by far is the Dracula books I've done.

04:28.460 --> 04:38.900
I get more letters and mail and sometimes more money for one of those than for all of

04:38.900 --> 04:39.380
the Berserkers.

04:40.420 --> 04:47.460
The Berserkers have been around a long time, and a lot of people have picked up on them

04:47.460 --> 04:53.500
over the years, but they're not really what sells the most books now.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.560
We'll have more on Fred Saber Hagen tomorrow.

05:03.900 --> 05:08.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:08.540 --> 05:12.340
Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:14.300 --> 06:19.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:22.540 --> 06:23.800
And here are your hosts.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.460
This is Daryl Lane.

06:29.780 --> 06:30.420
And Bill Vernon.

06:31.020 --> 06:34.660
Fred Saber Hagen has been a professional science fiction author for some 17 years.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.880
His output is notable for its variety.

06:36.880 --> 06:42.360
Even though he writes typical science fiction, good science fiction such as the popular Berserkers

06:42.360 --> 06:44.620
series, he tries related areas too.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.580
Well, I like to change back and forth.

06:49.840 --> 06:57.860
I think I get a little tired of doing whatever it is I'm doing after a long book, and then

06:57.860 --> 07:02.500
I like to do something as different as I can find from that.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.720
One of his novels that varies from straight science fiction is The Huge Empire of the East,

07:08.040 --> 07:10.240
a story with the characteristics of science fantasy.

07:11.200 --> 07:16.240
Originally there were three books, The Broken Lands, Black Mountains, and Changeling Earth.

07:17.300 --> 07:26.080
And they came out some years earlier with split up among two different publishers as it happened,

07:26.240 --> 07:30.280
the way problems of publishing and everything being of what they are.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.360
Magic works in The Empire of the East and sorcery is an occupation.

07:36.040 --> 07:41.020
And this is so because the structure of atoms has been changed, making nuclear power and technology impossible.

07:41.540 --> 07:45.180
But at the novel's end there's a tremendous battle between inhuman forces.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.620
One is Orcus, a demon power that represents the irrational into magic.

07:50.780 --> 07:56.280
The other is Ardna, a super machine which has gathered enough strength to challenge the magical foundation of the world.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.400
The result of the battle is a balance.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.980
Technology and magic will coexist.

08:02.180 --> 08:09.120
The world was changing again and at least for a time both of these kinds of powers would be functional.

08:10.300 --> 08:14.140
In 1976, Saber Hagen published a horror story in the classic tradition,

08:14.820 --> 08:19.980
a mysterious house, an unknown force haunting it, a family buying the house and moving in.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.600
The book is Specimens.

08:22.700 --> 08:28.460
Kind of a fun story if you can call it that, of a menace to be overcome.

08:29.020 --> 08:36.460
The old house in the story by the way really exists in Lombard, or dead a few years ago.

08:37.240 --> 08:44.560
When we lived in Chicago we were looking for houses in the area there and that was one that we looked at.

08:45.660 --> 08:48.740
The power haunting the house is an alien living beneath it.

08:48.740 --> 08:53.820
It's been there for centuries, even before the house was built, capturing humans as specimens.

08:54.800 --> 09:02.200
It was an attempt to write a good Grade B movie plot and nobody has bought it yet to make a good Grade B movie,

09:02.540 --> 09:08.020
but there's a new Ace Edition coming out in a few months here and maybe somebody will.

09:09.080 --> 09:15.360
Another facet of Saber Hagen's variety is seen in a little known satire, Love Conquers All, which came out in 1974.

09:15.360 --> 09:23.520
It extrapolates strongly from present social trends and in that sense is reminiscent of Paul and Cornbluth's advertising classic, The Space Merchants.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.240
But Saber Hagen extrapolates from something very different than advertising.

09:28.200 --> 09:42.500
I guess it was the controversy about abortion and sex and things were bombarded, questions were faced with all the time here.

09:44.380 --> 09:58.220
And I just tried to, you know, one of the traditional science fiction writers' viewpoint, take a look at everything, turn everything inside out and see how it looks from the other point of view.

09:59.140 --> 10:04.040
In Love Conquers All, Saber Hagen totally reverses all our present attitudes towards sex and love.

10:04.680 --> 10:09.560
The book presents a world in which a wife should have affairs, in which virginity is horrifying.

10:09.560 --> 10:14.940
And as a clever touch, the curses people use are words like purity and chastity.

10:15.980 --> 10:21.000
We asked Saber Hagen if the book had a message. Was it satire? Was he on a soapbox?

10:22.420 --> 10:33.700
No, I think that's your department really. Whether it's satire or what it is, I think I've done my job when I've written it.

10:34.440 --> 10:40.160
So I wouldn't say you're wrong. Classify it however you will.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.180
Tomorrow, more of Fred Saber Hagen.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.480
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

12:02.860 --> 12:08.180
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.500
And here are your hosts.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.340
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lange.

12:19.760 --> 12:25.240
Dracula, the fearsome vampire of legend and myth. You wouldn't think anything new could be written on him.

12:25.740 --> 12:30.700
But science fiction author Fred Saber Hagen thought otherwise. So far he's written five novels on Dracula.

12:31.980 --> 12:38.720
The Dracula tape is the first one, which is a recounting of the original Ram Stoker's original Dracula story.

12:39.200 --> 12:49.520
Only seen from the point of view of the count. And there's Holmes Dracula and an old friend of the family and Thorne, which is out now.

12:51.260 --> 12:58.320
Since we spoke with Saber Hagen, the fifth book in the series, Dominion, has come out. We ask him how he got interested in Dracula.

12:59.440 --> 13:10.820
Well, it started, I just sat down one day and just for fun. I wanted to reread the original Dracula, which I had read once before, years earlier.

13:12.220 --> 13:20.820
And I think it's not all that good a book really, apart from this titanic devilish central character.

13:20.820 --> 13:28.100
But it struck me more and more as I read through it that Dracula was hardly ever on stage.

13:29.660 --> 13:36.460
And this thing, everybody's talking about him and he's almost always off somewhere doing something. Nobody quite knows what.

13:39.480 --> 13:44.120
So I guess maybe I had Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead on my mind or something like that.

13:44.120 --> 13:50.100
But I just thought, what would it look like from the chief villains point of view?

13:51.340 --> 13:57.360
So off I went. It was awful lot of fun to write and it just seemed to go right along.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.880
The first book was the Dracula tape published in 1975.

14:02.680 --> 14:10.540
In this novel, Dracula is telling what really happened to Lucy, Professor Van Helsing and Jonathan, the characters from the Brahms Stoker novel.

14:10.540 --> 14:15.740
As it turns out, the count is a victim of circumstances and Van Helsing is a demented loony.

14:16.300 --> 14:21.160
In Saberhagen's account, the vampire almost never kills anyone. He just takes a court to go.

14:21.820 --> 14:28.180
It was Van Helsing who was accidentally killing the victims by giving them blood transfusions from persons whose blood type didn't match.

14:28.820 --> 14:33.240
And readers liked it. It was something different, Dracula from the vampire's point of view.

14:33.780 --> 14:39.560
And Saberhagen had something different, even unique, for the sequel, entitled The Holmes Dracula File.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.720
The time came to think about doing a sequel for it.

14:43.940 --> 14:51.660
And it occurred to me that nobody had ever put Holmes and Dracula in the same book up to that point as far as I knew.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.740
And it seemed to me they, this would be very interesting.

14:57.980 --> 15:05.420
It's as if they represented the two sides of the human psyche or the intellect and the dark side.

15:05.420 --> 15:12.300
And here they were, they were contemporaries. They were in the same city, in the same year.

15:12.900 --> 15:22.340
And everybody knew about them both and still they'd never, they just completely missed each other.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.400
So I decided I had to try to make contact there someplace.

15:27.160 --> 15:35.000
Can Saberhagen's Dracula material be considered science fiction? Its popularity is obvious, but does it attract science fiction readers or some other type?

15:35.740 --> 15:40.720
Sometimes you see it on the fantasy shelf in the bookstore. Sometimes you see it in occult.

15:42.620 --> 15:54.280
Sometimes you see it on the new shelf or only the zombies and haunted babies and all these modern recent things appear.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.660
I don't really care as long as people are reading it.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.120
I don't know if they're science fiction readers. Some of them think they're vampires.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.080
You get a pretty good, maybe some of them are vampires.

16:07.720 --> 16:12.140
How do the Dracula books compare with Saberhagen's other books in terms of reader response?

16:13.360 --> 16:19.000
I think what's got the biggest reader response by far is the Dracula books I've done.

16:20.240 --> 16:27.020
I get more, more letters and mail and sometimes more money.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.500
We'll have more on Fred Saberhagen tomorrow.

16:38.080 --> 16:46.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.100
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:32.100 --> 17:35.100
Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:50.900 --> 17:56.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.440
And here are your hosts.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.260
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

18:07.780 --> 18:12.400
In the worlds of science fiction, the deadliest enemies man has to face are the berserkers of Fred Saberhagen.

18:12.720 --> 18:18.100
The berserkers are machines, highly intelligent machines that are able to reproduce and to repair themselves endlessly.

18:19.200 --> 18:24.820
They come in all sizes, from immense globes the size of worlds to robots or androids that simulate human beings.

18:24.820 --> 18:32.700
And they are all deadly killing machines. Each berserker is programmed to do one thing and one thing only to seek out and destroy all life.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.740
Author Saberhagen discusses the origin of the term.

18:36.920 --> 18:47.000
Of course the berserkers historically are the Norse warriors who would go mad and run around killing people until they were killed.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.580
And I don't know why it just seemed to come along with the original concept and I used it.

18:56.840 --> 19:02.300
The berserkers originated far in the past before humanity had achieved technology or space travel.

19:02.800 --> 19:09.900
There had been two super races engaged in interstellar war. One of them had produced and programmed the berserkers machines to annihilate its enemies.

19:09.900 --> 19:17.780
Now the two warring races have vanished but the berserkers remain, fulfilling their function of searching out and destroying all forms of life.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.260
Saberhagen recalls when he wrote his first berserker story.

19:22.280 --> 19:29.280
I was writing, let's see back very early, in the early 1960s.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.980
I was writing short stories, most of which were being published in Galaxy or Worlds of If, Worlds of Tomorrow, Fred Poles, the editor then.

19:41.940 --> 19:47.560
And I had this good idea for a short kind of a puzzle short story.

19:48.100 --> 19:53.820
And I got about halfway through the story and I said, well what sort of a villain will I have?

19:53.820 --> 20:02.620
And I said, I know what sort of villain I'll have. I'll have this giant robotic spaceship, 50 miles in diameter, et cetera, et cetera.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.060
And it just, I just looked around and there it was.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.280
Saberhagen's editor, Frederick Pole, liked the berserker idea.

20:14.180 --> 20:21.240
Fred Pole really liked the berserker. He didn't, he bought the story. He wasn't all that crazy about the story, but he liked the berserker.

20:22.620 --> 20:28.900
And he said, why don't you do some more berserkers? Have somebody go on one of these things and so on.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.560
And it's just there for a while about all I wrote was berserkers.

20:34.620 --> 20:39.980
Since the 60s, Saberhagen has written some 30 berserker stories for various science fiction magazines.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.640
Most have been collected in four volumes.

20:43.300 --> 20:47.940
Berserker, The Ultimate Enemy, Berserker Man, and The Berserker Wars.

20:47.940 --> 20:51.940
And he's also written one berserker novel, Brother Assassin.

20:53.220 --> 20:56.800
Many of the berserker stories are related with recurring characters or settings.

20:57.460 --> 21:04.440
They are also spread over a huge span of time, thousands of years, so that Saberhagen can experiment with different human cultures and technologies.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.500
As mankind battles, it's seemingly unstoppable enemy.

21:08.440 --> 21:13.640
We asked Saberhagen if he had worked out a precise future history or timeline for the berserker material.

21:14.640 --> 21:20.740
What I've tried to do is just always leave plenty of room in every direction.

21:20.940 --> 21:26.740
I have this war going on for thousands of years and over at least a good part of the galaxy.

21:29.300 --> 21:39.200
And I've never really, I guess if you asked me about two different stories, I could probably tell you which one was supposed to come ahead of the other one.

21:39.200 --> 21:46.060
But I just wanted to avoid being too limited.

21:46.240 --> 21:50.600
Fred Poe thought I was about to wipe out all the berserkers there at one point.

21:50.740 --> 21:56.620
I did a story called Stone Place where this huge berserker fleet was destroyed.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.940
But I took care that some of them got away at least.

22:02.180 --> 22:05.760
The berserkers haven't been destroyed, so the battle is still going on.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.160
But Saberhagen isn't sure he'll do any more stories on the material.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.820
Right now I don't have any special urge to write another berserker story.

22:15.340 --> 22:17.000
And I don't know if I ever will or not.

22:24.260 --> 22:32.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
