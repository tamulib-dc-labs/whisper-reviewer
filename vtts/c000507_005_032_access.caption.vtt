00:01.180 --> 00:12.840
I screwed it up. I wasn't proud of it. I tried it. But anyway, it's not that I'm
a gourmet cook. I hate that word. It's just that if I eat something someplace

00:12.840 --> 00:22.320
and I like it, I just kind of like to figure out how it's done and try to
duplicate it as well. What about you? Oh, no. I was just wondering when I read

00:22.320 --> 00:29.960
some of your works and some of the foods you come up with on various planets.
Oh, well. Yeah, I get hungry. I couldn't, a lot of that junk, I wouldn't,

00:29.960 --> 00:37.700
there's no way, kind of meat and potatoes. Yeah, okay, he's got the tape
running, so I'll just get through these other questions. So we're being taped

00:37.700 --> 00:53.280
again. Yeah. Do you sell well over in Europe? Well, it varies. Essentially,
yeah, I do. Especially in the Netherlands, Holland. then I do well in France and

00:53.280 --> 01:06.580
in Germany, England, and lesser extent Italy, and in Spain I don't think
there's, nobody does too well, maybe in Portugal. The best I sell though is in

01:06.580 --> 01:21.420
Holland. Next is all about the same. In Scandinavia, nobody does very well up
there either. They all read English. There's a great deal of market for

01:21.420 --> 01:34.660
translations. Translations in the Swedish thing. A lot of English books over
there. Anybody who likes science fiction generally gets in English. Well, have

01:34.660 --> 01:36.600
you been translated into a number of languages then?

01:39.780 --> 01:41.300
All the usual ones.

01:44.460 --> 01:49.580
I don't think I can translate it into Ngarik

01:49.580 --> 01:59.000
or Tasmanian or anything like that, but, you know, just usual languages. I don't
know if I've sold anything in Russia or not, I just don't know.

02:02.160 --> 02:20.540
I suspect not, though. I'm too much of a non-collectivist, I think, and also I
don't attack the institutions of the United States, to prepare. But you want to

02:20.540 --> 02:36.000
sell in Russia, then you have to be a very stern critic of conventional
institutions. Rather than attacking, I admire the world. The United States, it's

02:36.000 --> 02:50.940
amazingly well, how well it functions. Obvious drawbacks, obvious discrepancies.
But when you think how complicated, you know, this country we live in is, and

02:50.940 --> 03:05.220
how many people are all individuals in, not necessarily working against each
other, but in competition with each other, it's amazing how many happy people

03:05.220 --> 03:25.960
the system is able to keep going. Now, that's not to say that I am endorsing
every aspect of life, obviously. But I still sometimes wonder about it. Uh, it

03:25.960 --> 03:29.860
just seems as if, well,

03:30.000 --> 03:39.560
that's enough of that. Yeah, okay. Yeah. In the 60s, you did some mystery
writing, in fact, I think you're the only person who's ever won both, what, the

03:39.560 --> 03:47.260
Hugo and the Edgar Award for science fiction and the Edgar for mysteries. Paul
Anderson has got it. Paul Anderson did? Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. We talked

03:47.260 --> 04:01.020
to him last year. Yeah. Well, I was going to ask you. What made you try the
mystery route? When I read for fun, that's the stuff I read. I don't ever read

04:01.020 --> 04:13.760
any so-called science fiction. That's the last thing I've read. I don't even
read much mysteries. About every three years I may go on a mystery kick and pick

04:13.760 --> 04:17.980
up maybe four or five of them. to go through. But

04:24.500 --> 04:32.560
it's kind of an artificial feel, like science fiction is, in a way. Let's
scratch that, though. Take that out.

04:35.420 --> 04:47.360
Artificial is the wrong word. If I try to explain myself, I'd be talking too
long ago. But anyway, Anyway, I do like mysteries.

04:48.460 --> 04:57.440
In fact I'd do some more if I had time. I don't do them because there's not
enough money in them. I make more money in science fiction than mysteries. Well,

04:57.520 --> 05:04.680
isn't some of your science fiction work, say the Magnus Ryd-Off or the Kurth
Gerson stuff. Those are almost detective kind of stories. Yeah, they almost are.

05:04.860 --> 05:10.460
Then I was using Miro Edtzel, the effectuator.

05:24.800 --> 05:37.740
It's like a detective. In fact that's how I got Miro Hetzel started. Because I
wanted to have a, I wasn't so pleased. Magnus Reidolf was okay for his time. but

05:37.740 --> 05:52.100
I want to get something just a little bit different and so I got Nero Hetzel and
if I have time I want to do some more I've got uh well anyways I was just going

05:52.100 --> 06:02.640
to say that I was going to confront Nero Hetzel with the task of discovering the
perpetrator of a crime which had not been committed in an unknown world at an

06:02.640 --> 06:14.160
unknown time and nobody knows why that was the problem is going to face it.
Somebody's going to say, here's something I want you to do. Solve this problem.

06:16.380 --> 06:28.880
And I worked it out, actually, believe it or not. In other words, if you have
time to write it, you'll write it someday. Yeah. Okay, I've noticed in the last

06:28.880 --> 06:38.900
few years, I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I've noticed an increasing
critical attention to your work. Play more recognition on terms on the Yeah,

06:39.040 --> 06:53.840
I've noticed that too. What's your reaction to that? Well, every knock is a
boost. The more the better. Okay. Yeah. In other words, if I get some critical

06:53.840 --> 07:08.040
attention, I'll start selling more. Make more money. Which is the name of the
game. Yeah? Yeah, I guess so. Do you well you certainly must have some desire to

07:08.040 --> 07:19.320
be in the far future to be remembered and studied or you just want to be noted
as a freelance writer who made a living well obviously if I have to take my

07:19.320 --> 07:20.700
choice I'll take the first one

07:25.560 --> 07:26.000
but

07:30.620 --> 07:44.680
the way I'd like to be remembered is a very rich writer who changed the way that
people perceived the world. Joe Joseph, of course. Got a label out of the Joe.

07:45.060 --> 07:57.260
Oh, I like that. Yeah. But I like the idea of being, I want to be remembered as
a very wealthy writer. Okay. Okay. Do you have any movie nibbles? That's the way

07:57.260 --> 08:11.420
to get wealthy. Yeah, I know. Actually, I just had some just the other day. But
it's so tenuous that several levels come to think of it. In fact, when I think

08:11.420 --> 08:22.960
about it a little bit, there's one from France on Bad Rivals, I don't know if
you know that story or not. But to my terror, I'm feeling that I have a horror

08:22.960 --> 08:33.920
and agony. I find that I find a way I'll write through this thing. I make a
movie on that in France, I am out. I don't get vilched. So then in England,

08:33.920 --> 08:44.060
there's some kind of vague nibbles on something else. And then just the other
day, I was talking to some people from Hollywood, and there's some nibbles on

08:44.060 --> 08:58.240
something else. And then, again, as soon as I get this, finish this thing, I'm
going to start working treatment on a suspense story. which will be deep sea

08:58.240 --> 09:10.960
sailing. I have a... my son and I actually together. We have a big boat. And
we're trying to get out to sea and sail at least down the South Pacific on it.

09:14.300 --> 09:27.100
And I've got this idea for a story, a spent story on this boat. And I'd like to
see if I can make some money on it. okay now you've mentioned this throughout

09:27.100 --> 09:35.000
the talk i just want to sort of draw this together now for your your future
plans for science fiction fantasy works you're going to do some more kugel maybe

09:35.000 --> 09:45.120
and you have just finished that long i just finished the first draft just
finished okay on that medieval type book you said yeah it's medieval fantasy

09:45.120 --> 10:04.600
it's uh to like that King Arthur stuff it predates the legendary well that the
whole art Arthurian stuff it's say 150 years before this and it's a kind of a

10:04.600 --> 10:21.120
similar atmosphere but all the different similar but different but it's that
kind of a locale that of the Arthurian times. But it's got nothing to do with

10:21.120 --> 10:34.360
King Arthur. Nor any holy grails or that sort. It's totally different. And you
may write some more Miro Hetzel too. Yes. But if I, if time, time is just a

10:34.360 --> 10:46.280
factor in all these things. See there's something else I wanted to do and I
could have forgot what it was then. in a new course I'll come to me I don't

10:46.280 --> 10:56.500
have. Well, there's Alastor. There's lots of Alastor. I've got three thousand
planets there to deal with. Right. And keep me busy a little bit. Oh, there's

10:56.500 --> 11:07.400
lots of stuff to be done. All you have to do is get started on it. Yeah, okay.
Listen, I just have maybe two more here. My favorite story of yours, I don't

11:07.400 --> 11:10.580
know what you can say about this. I'm not even sure if I have a question on it,
but it's Green

11:19.680 --> 11:22.080
Yeah, I'm an optimistic. Alright,

11:24.820 --> 11:33.620
I'm going to ask you if you're an optimistic individual. Yeah, I'm an
optimistic.

11:47.320 --> 11:56.160
Well, it's hard to be a continual

11:56.160 --> 12:11.520
optimist. and it's not a very pleasant way to live to be a pessimist. I'd much
prefer being an optimist, but then on the other hand, it's evident to all of us

12:11.520 --> 12:19.320
that life is basically tragic. You just get things going and then you're dead.

12:22.780 --> 12:39.840
That's hard to refute. And it's hard to be an optimism in the face of this grim,
dark reality underneath, you know. But as far as living from day to day, you

12:39.840 --> 12:48.580
might as well enjoy your life. Because who knows what comes after? Yeah, the way
I connect that to green magic is that the protagonist, I forget his name, I

12:48.580 --> 13:01.180
think it was Harry, I can't remember. he is never again going to be happy on
earth after he's experienced the Green Realm it's just essentially the story it

13:01.180 --> 13:16.640
just remarks quietly that if you're able to achieve all your all your goals
easily nothing seems fun anymore I guess that I don't want to put it into words

13:16.640 --> 13:25.400
like that too much because Because I did not have that in mind when I was
writing it. In fact, I wrote the thing... A damn dog was yelling at somebody

13:25.400 --> 13:38.520
coming in here. I wrote the story without being thought in mind. Just the way
the story came. That's the way it turned out. In other words, I did not sit down

13:38.520 --> 14:14.940
and say I'm going to write a story about the futility of dreams. Or the horror
of human existence. that they loved him.

14:16.560 --> 14:30.720
I might have some extra ones. But I, Tim probably might have. Except Tim
Underwood, I asked him once. Yeah. I'd like to use the phone sometimes. What is

14:30.720 --> 14:37.840
it about, Dan? That's my little teenage kid. Yeah. He wants me off the phone.
You think if he wrote Tim Underwood a letter and just asked him if he had any

14:37.840 --> 14:51.720
more extras? Well, no, I asked him once. He said, well, you know, he says I
should keep these things. because they go up and appreciate. But he says, I just

14:51.720 --> 14:59.920
don't have people write me for him, and I just send him out. And I don't know
whether he has any more or not. Why don't you give him a call? Yeah, okay, we

14:59.920 --> 15:02.760
will. Yeah, 752-7920.

15:05.540 --> 15:13.520
752-7920. What's the area code? What is he? Back in Pennsylvania? He's right
here. Oh, I thought he was out there in the east. No, that's Chuck Miller back

15:13.520 --> 15:24.060
in the east. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, it's just, he lives in San Francisco. Yeah,
okay. I might have some downstairs. I don't know how many I've got. I might have

15:24.060 --> 15:33.160
one or two. I just don't know. You must spend half your life signing some of
those. I've signed a lot of them, yeah. I've signed, signed, signed, signed.

15:34.020 --> 15:42.280
Well, listen, I've taken enough of your time, Mr. Vance. We really appreciate
this. What we do now, this show probably won't go on until after the first of

15:42.280 --> 15:52.680
the year. We tape way ahead. so when we get it edited we will send you copies of
the tape and and you know look forward to your future work with great

15:52.680 --> 15:57.240
anticipation and we appreciate the time very much thank you
