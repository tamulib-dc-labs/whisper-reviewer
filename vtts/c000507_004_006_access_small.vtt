00:02.100 --> 00:08.160
Alright, well, if we ask you any dumb questions or one that you don't feel comfortable with

00:08.160 --> 00:10.880
or you don't like your answer, just tell us and we'll start it over, okay?

00:11.240 --> 00:11.780
Oh, alright.

00:12.240 --> 00:12.720
Okay.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.660
The first Wizard of Oz book, the Wizard of Oz, came out in 1900.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.520
How old was Frank Baum then?

00:21.160 --> 00:23.200
He was 44 years old at that time.

00:24.660 --> 00:31.060
Had he done any other fiction before he started on the Wizard series, the Oz series?

00:31.440 --> 00:34.380
Well, he had out several other books before then.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.240
His first book was a book on how to raise chickens in 1886, the book of the Hamburgs.

00:41.340 --> 00:49.380
But his most famous books were for children and he had a book out in 1897 called Mother Goose in Prose.

00:49.380 --> 00:56.280
And then in 1899 he had out one that proved very popular, successful, called Father Goose, his book.

00:57.180 --> 01:04.660
And in the same year he brought out the Wizard of Oz in 1900, he had three other books at the same time.

01:07.220 --> 01:12.260
What kind of audience was Baum aiming for when he wrote the Oz books?

01:13.140 --> 01:20.300
Well, he had young sons at the time that he supposedly told the stories to.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.100
And I suppose children become temporary with his own children.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.200
I don't know quite what audience because the books have a wide appeal to people of all ages.

01:32.620 --> 01:36.280
But probably he was aiming at children 10, 12 long there.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.980
In reading the books, I see it on two levels.

01:43.420 --> 01:47.840
My five-year-old daughter enjoys the witches and the magic and the cute characters.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.400
And I enjoy the puns and that sort of thing.

01:50.480 --> 01:56.540
I was wondering if anybody knows how much effort he put into the upper level versus the lower level, the children's level.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.440
No, I don't know how much he put into it. Apparently he wrote fairly effortlessly though.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.780
I have seen only one of his manuscripts.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.020
It happened to be the one for Glinda of Oz.

02:10.100 --> 02:14.520
It's an amazingly clean manuscript. Very few corrections entered or anything.

02:15.300 --> 02:19.720
And he wrote in longhand first and then he typed the manuscript later.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.840
And that's when he made whatever editing he had.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.940
But it seems just to come quite easily to it.

02:28.520 --> 02:33.100
Are his manuscripts and other personal memorabilia collected anywhere?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.740
Well, there are not many of them that are in existence.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.060
If they were, they would indeed be a collector's item.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.980
At the end of the sixth book, the Emerald City of Oz,

02:47.240 --> 02:52.060
Bob apparently wanted to stop because he sealed off Oz and then the seventh one appeared.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.120
Was he serious about wanting to call it off at number six?

02:56.060 --> 03:01.260
Apparently he was. He felt he had written maybe enough about Oz

03:01.260 --> 03:04.140
that he was getting typed as an author.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.700
And while he was very proud to be associated with Oz, he thought it was very successful,

03:09.120 --> 03:10.820
he did want to write many other things.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.200
And so he thought that was the best way to end it.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.640
Was there truly a landslide of letters and telegrams to him

03:20.640 --> 03:22.480
that made him want to go ahead and write some more?

03:22.480 --> 03:28.640
Apparently there were a lot of letters and publishers received letters also.

03:29.260 --> 03:33.960
He did write two other books that weren't about Oz after he wrote the sixth book.

03:34.820 --> 03:39.220
And they were not as successful and children still asked for more about Oz,

03:39.340 --> 03:42.200
so two, three years later he returned to Oz.

03:44.100 --> 03:50.360
In the forwards to the books, he mentions that the children wrote and suggested this or that.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.100
Are those apocryphal stories or are those pretty much true?

03:53.860 --> 03:55.200
I really don't know.

03:55.600 --> 04:01.480
I suspect that from what I know about him that the books are entirely his own.

04:02.100 --> 04:06.080
Of course everyone gets inspiration from some source or other,

04:06.360 --> 04:12.440
but I have an idea that as a careful writer, the books are largely his own creation.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.060
Were they a financial success for him?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.480
Did he become independently wealthy before them?

04:21.440 --> 04:23.540
Well, he certainly made a living from them.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.560
He was able to build a comfortable home in Hollywood,

04:28.980 --> 04:33.880
and after his death, his widow lived in it for the rest of her days.

04:34.600 --> 04:39.380
And the house stood, I believe, until about 1954, but it's no longer there now.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.880
But anyway, yes, he made a good living from them.

04:46.220 --> 04:52.360
The last novel that he wrote, Glenda of Oz, was number 14, and it was copyrighted in 1920.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.620
I said, when did he die? 1919?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.620
Yes, he died in 1919.

04:56.020 --> 05:00.560
At the time he died, he had been sick for about a year, year and a half,

05:00.880 --> 05:08.760
and he had a couple of manuscripts completed ahead so that they could be published even after he had died.

05:10.040 --> 05:15.420
Did he live any notes or diaries or anything about other stories that he had planned to write?

05:16.220 --> 05:20.460
That's a tradition that he did, but no one's ever found any.

05:21.300 --> 05:26.980
There was one brief little chapter of a book that may have been by him,

05:27.480 --> 05:31.080
but some accepted it as by him.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.360
I'm inclined to.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.820
Others are doubtful if it really was his.

05:37.140 --> 05:43.280
The reason I'm inclined to accept it is because it was about the Magic Lake south of the Emerald City.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.660
And Bob had written about almost everything on the Oz map except that.

05:48.040 --> 05:54.480
And I don't know how perceptive anyone else would have been to write about that very lake he hadn't written about before.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.760
But at any rate, it was the first chapter of his story.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.880
It's impossible to tell how it would have developed from the one little chapter.

06:05.340 --> 06:11.960
Since Bon wrote his 14 novels, there have been a number of other novels written.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.880
How many have been written here up till now?

06:15.700 --> 06:23.340
Well, nowadays there are 40 books in the series, which means there would be 26 in the series after that one.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.820
But there are other Oz books besides the ones in the official series.

06:29.960 --> 06:35.860
How soon after Bon's death did people start writing novels, picking up where he left off?

06:38.260 --> 06:39.620
Apparently right away.

06:41.020 --> 06:48.600
I have visited the publisher and they had a novel, a manuscript novel, that they had received and liked very much.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.040
But they had already had a contract with another author to continue the series.

06:53.040 --> 07:01.280
So there seems to be some evidence that the other authors had ideas of continuing the series from the beginning.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.600
This question is probably kind of hard to answer.

07:07.880 --> 07:12.380
Do the subsequent works more or less maintain the same quality?

07:12.820 --> 07:20.560
And are they successful on the adult level and the child's level as successful as Bon's original works were?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.040
Well, probably.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.740
Well, here's where you get into rather subjective feelings about them.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.200
And it's difficult to give a definitive answer on this.

07:30.820 --> 07:35.380
But each author wrote somewhat differently about Oz.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.080
As a child, I accepted all of the books and enjoyed them.

07:41.560 --> 07:46.600
But as an adult, I can see differences between the way the authors wrote.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.300
And there are people who will not read any books except Bon's.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.260
And then there's others that will accept this author, that author, and are choosy that way.

07:57.100 --> 08:03.380
But the authors often wrote just for the children and didn't attempt to write on quite so many levels.

08:04.120 --> 08:12.960
So there are strange things in the other books by that, I mean on different levels, called the level of meaning in terms of course.

08:12.960 --> 08:18.860
But Bon seemed to be more successful at that than the others were consistently doing.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.440
Okay, I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you now.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.520
We're having some stormy weather here.

08:27.060 --> 08:31.020
If you could talk just a little louder, let's see if that works.

08:31.480 --> 08:40.380
Okay, have there been any serious academic studies of say comparisons of Bon's work with subsequent works?

08:41.080 --> 08:43.140
Theses, dissertations, that sort of thing?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.920
Well, yes, there have been.

08:46.940 --> 08:51.040
I know of one person who wrote a doctoral dissertation on Bon's books.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.260
And the person is now a professor of English.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.340
There have been many essays written about the Oz books.

09:01.820 --> 09:06.220
And as a matter of fact, a book of them being gathered together will come out this fall.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.100
But just how many there are, I couldn't tell you.

09:14.740 --> 09:27.400
The Oz idea has, well, there have been a lot of plays and movies and cartoons and such that have been inspired by the Oz idea.

09:27.840 --> 09:33.840
They invariably changed the script or the script has changed from the major works.

09:34.880 --> 09:40.660
Why is that? Why doesn't somebody do the Wizard of Oz as it was written, something like that?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
Why do they feel compelled to change it?

09:43.340 --> 09:49.180
Well, I suppose to fit the drama into what they can work with,

09:49.260 --> 09:55.500
yet sometimes it's quite difficult to fit in certain characteristics of Oz, the different magic and so on.

09:55.880 --> 10:02.940
For instance, in the stage play of 1902 and 3, in that period of time, Dorothy's dog, Toto, didn't appear in it at all.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.980
Instead, they had a calf for a pet.

10:05.520 --> 10:10.820
An actor could play the part of a calf, whereas an actor as a dog would have had a difficult time, especially a tiny dog.

10:12.360 --> 10:19.000
It seems to be necessary to do it to make the dramatization. They've almost all done it.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.500
Did that play appear on Broadway?

10:25.500 --> 10:39.580
Yes. It started in Chicago in 1902, but early in 1903 it moved to Broadway, and it ran there and one theater or another for a number of years, for five years or more.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.620
And then for many years after that there were road shows of it.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.920
So apparently it's quite a successful play.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.480
It seemed to be.

10:51.880 --> 10:58.040
Have there been any more plays based on it? I guess the Wiz was. Is there been anything else?

10:58.480 --> 11:02.240
The Wiz was based on it, and the Wiz was fairly close to the book.

11:03.580 --> 11:09.080
Yes, there have been plays, but many plays put on about The Wizard of Oz.

11:09.800 --> 11:15.540
Occasionally, someone dramatizes one of the other books, but that doesn't happen very often.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.360
The Wizard of Oz is overwhelmingly the best known, of course.

11:21.040 --> 11:28.580
It's my understanding that, is it the Disney Studios that bought the rights to all of Balm's works, or all of his Oz works?

11:29.240 --> 11:34.220
They have the rights, as I understand, to great many of the Balm Oz books.

11:34.520 --> 11:42.380
Of course, MGM had the right to The Wizard of Oz, but I believe the Disney Studios has the rights to all the others of the Balm Oz books.

11:45.080 --> 11:50.060
And apparently they are working on an Oz film at the present time.

11:52.480 --> 11:59.700
Why have the Oz works stayed so popular? They were apparently popular when they first came out.

12:00.260 --> 12:05.560
They're still popular today. Why, for 80, whatever years? Why have they maintained their popularity?

12:06.020 --> 12:08.240
What is in them that is so universally appealing?

12:08.240 --> 12:12.000
Well, apparently something is in them that's universally appealing.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.820
I guess the idea of a little girl speaking home strikes a responsive chord with some people.

12:19.540 --> 12:25.060
And of course, the search for wisdom, courage, and kindness are certain noble ideals.

12:27.100 --> 12:31.220
And a humbug wizard and so on also was attractive.

12:32.220 --> 12:37.780
But there's just something about them that strikes a certain response to some kind of people.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.040
And it's difficult to explain what it is.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.620
As a matter of fact, if you ask six different people, you probably get six different answers.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.820
Different ones will not even agree on which books they would prefer, of the ones they've read.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.000
It much depends on the circumstances under which you read the book, I suppose.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.860
Another gentleman that was apparently quite important to the series was John R. Neal,

13:05.160 --> 13:09.020
whom I have heard was called the Imperial Illustrator of Oz.

13:09.500 --> 13:15.100
How did he get hooked up with the series and has any artist ever equalled his work for the Oz series?

13:17.040 --> 13:22.620
Well, the publishers asked him to illustrate the second Oz book.

13:22.620 --> 13:27.700
And after that, they liked his work and asked him to illustrate the others.

13:28.260 --> 13:34.120
He was a young artist in Philadelphia at the time and had illustrated things there and other books even.

13:34.660 --> 13:38.880
But he was just starting his career in 1994 when the second Oz book came out.

13:39.900 --> 13:44.180
And he became very closely associated with Oz.

13:44.620 --> 13:49.860
Many persons think of the characters as he drew them, rather than as any other artist drew them.

13:50.380 --> 13:53.720
And, of course, eventually he wrote three books as well as illustrated them.

13:55.180 --> 14:01.220
Between 1944 and 1942, he illustrated all of the Oz books that came out, which is quite a span of years.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.800
We were just talking that the books did have universal appeal.

14:10.660 --> 14:16.080
And, of course, the reason we're talking to you is because you're associated with the International Wizard of Oz Club.

14:16.080 --> 14:21.980
Tell us a little bit about that organization, how large it is, what kinds of people are in it, that sort of thing.

14:22.600 --> 14:29.320
Well, the club has different times, between a thousand, two thousand members.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.100
And all kinds of people are in the club.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.840
Very young children, adults, many years are in it.

14:38.220 --> 14:42.020
And all kinds of interests and professions are in it.

14:42.020 --> 14:47.860
But we do have in common some affection for Oz or the creation or idea of it.

14:48.280 --> 14:53.300
Many of us are collecting the books and many just simply want reading copies.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.980
Others want to build fine collections.

14:55.760 --> 15:04.580
Some have other interests, such as the 1939 movie and finding all kinds of memorabilia concerning it.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.740
There's all kinds of ways to build an Oz collection.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.000
But we get together and we talk over the books and what we like best.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.360
We have quizzes over the books.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.260
We collect the old films.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.600
There were, El Frank Baum had an Oz film company in 1915.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.260
We collected some of the films made then, fourteen to fifteen films.

15:25.560 --> 15:29.960
We're silent, of course, but interested to see how he thought an Oz film should be made.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.100
And we do all kinds of things.

15:33.100 --> 15:40.960
We sing some of the songs from the stage plays, discuss how to identify the different editions.

15:43.860 --> 15:47.300
Well, I just generally just, it's a mutual interest organization.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.780
And help each other find the books we need.

15:51.140 --> 16:01.440
So there's a whole subculture of people who collect Oz memorabilia as well as are just interested in Oz.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.340
Well, yes, there are quite a few collectors of this.

16:04.420 --> 16:08.280
I'm sure there are many more people collected than just the ones in the club.

16:08.580 --> 16:13.600
But we do seem to enjoy each other's company and seeing our mutual interest.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.100
Where do people find the old books?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.180
I happen to be a book collector myself.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.860
Nothing quite this esoteric.

16:24.860 --> 16:31.480
But I would think some of the first editions of Oz would be pretty rare and pretty hard to come by.

16:32.260 --> 16:39.540
Do people pull them out of their attic sometimes or find them at a garage sale or whatever and everybody celebrates?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.240
Very much like that.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.460
There, of course, where you find them.

16:45.220 --> 16:53.000
But sometimes someone will, when you're not an addict, find in a box that there's some old Oz books that somebody put away years ago.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.980
And they, or no one in the family has interest in them and then they do sell them.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.360
Sometimes you get them from the book dealer.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.380
Oftentimes it's just upon finding them, searching them out.

17:05.940 --> 17:13.120
And it's, well, like building your own Yellowbrick Road, I guess, you first start out with reading copies and then you want better copies.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.380
And you have to have first editions.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.340
And there's just no end to it.

17:19.340 --> 17:27.100
There are also, as my understanding, I guess Oz toys, dolls of the characters and models and that sort of thing.

17:27.380 --> 17:34.580
Where did they, were those just toys or were they cereal box prizes or where did they pop up through the years?

17:35.140 --> 17:41.000
Well, there were quite a few things that came out in connection with the 1939 film.

17:41.920 --> 17:47.220
And apparently a lot more came out about the time of the Wiz stage play.

17:47.820 --> 17:49.240
A lot of more Oz things.

17:51.580 --> 17:57.040
Oftentimes they are in connection with the film or some of the stage play, rather than just the books themselves.

17:57.760 --> 18:05.820
There have been a few things in connection with the, with the books, such as Board Game, which is like a map of the land of Oz.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.900
You advance down the Yellowbrick Road by turn.

18:08.900 --> 18:14.420
But most of the things are in connection with the 39 movie or some other dramatization.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.140
Well, there's all kinds of things.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.680
There's dolls, there's clothes, there's dishes.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
There's no end to it.

18:24.620 --> 18:28.280
As a matter of fact, that's one of the projects the club is doing now, trying to catalog a few things.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.900
But we are not nearly finished doing it.

18:33.380 --> 18:41.520
Is the interest in Oz cyclical or it comes and goes or has it been pretty steady over the years?

18:42.380 --> 18:47.960
Well, in my own association with the club, it's been fairly steady.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.600
Not everyone is known about the club.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.120
But there's always been a core group that has been interested in it.

18:56.120 --> 19:02.920
And while membership doesn't always take consistent, each year people have to renew their membership if they want to keep it up.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.580
It's been fairly constant.

19:10.320 --> 19:18.880
Are reprints of Balm's work, the ones I'm specifically talking here now, are the Valentine paperback releases?

19:19.100 --> 19:20.820
Are those abridged in any manner?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.460
Are they straight things?

19:22.460 --> 19:24.960
I think they're straight books.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.580
I don't think they're abridged in any way.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.460
I'd say that without it.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.840
I don't believe I've examined them back closely.

19:31.960 --> 19:35.260
But as far as I know, they are careful reprints.

19:37.080 --> 19:49.600
One thing that impressed me about those particular reprints is the front covers are paintings based on the, I guess in all cases, but one, the needle drawings from the interior.

19:49.600 --> 19:55.720
And I'm not that much of an expert, but it really, my daughter really likes them.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.740
She can look at the cover and pick out who everybody is.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.380
And they're really nice.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.180
They're not abstract and they're not changed from the way the books are.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.480
Have you looked at the covers that closely on these new ones?

20:06.940 --> 20:09.740
Well, this is a very bright and colorful looking eye-attracting.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.180
People that are Oz fans, do they, can you generalize in any way?

20:18.180 --> 20:22.900
Do they have any other interests in the world of fantasy, per se?

20:23.660 --> 20:27.460
Well, many of them do have other interests.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.640
Collect more things than just the Oz books.

20:29.820 --> 20:30.260
That's true.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.760
I don't know if they all do or not.

20:33.880 --> 20:34.740
I don't suppose they do.

20:35.240 --> 20:40.240
I don't know all the club members personally, but I probably know more than any other person.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.500
But yes, many of them have other interests.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.060
Some just like children's books in general.

20:46.060 --> 20:53.280
Others will have something entirely different to their collecting, but they'll have another set of things besides Oz things.

20:56.040 --> 21:05.860
When somebody writes a book in the Oz series, is it cleared with the club as far as being in the,

21:06.940 --> 21:10.540
in the, kind of joining the fold of the Oz series?

21:10.960 --> 21:12.860
Or is this something that's just kind of unofficial?

21:12.860 --> 21:16.700
Somebody writes a book and it either is accepted or not.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.000
Is there anything official there?

21:18.460 --> 21:20.000
No, there's nothing official.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.360
The club has no authority to do anything like that.

21:23.940 --> 21:30.660
The club has published some Oz books, but we've done it with the commission of the publisher who published the series.

21:32.820 --> 21:37.220
And we, I don't think we would publish one unless the publisher agreed that we could.

21:40.780 --> 21:48.760
In my research, the name that I came across quite often was Ruth Plumlee Thompson,

21:49.220 --> 21:53.720
who apparently wrote Oz books from what, 1921 to 1939.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.000
How many did she end up writing?

21:56.620 --> 21:58.540
She wrote 19 books for the series.

21:59.500 --> 22:05.460
And then she wrote a couple of others which the club published, which are not part of the series,

22:05.460 --> 22:09.140
but they're her books though, just the same.

22:09.580 --> 22:15.300
And she wrote five other books that aren't about Oz, one of which was published by John Arneo called

22:15.300 --> 22:20.680
The Curious Cruise of Captain Sando, which is quite a collector's item to mind.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.200
She was a very delightful lady. I met her several times.

22:25.080 --> 22:30.760
And she lived until 1976, so of course she hasn't gone too long now.

22:30.760 --> 22:37.060
But she was totally unpredictable, very much like one of her own characters, absolutely delightful.

22:38.100 --> 22:42.200
Very witty and very, very intelligent lady.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.920
And just never knew what she would say next, what she would do.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.480
Does the Oz fan club have annual conventions?

22:55.460 --> 23:00.040
Yes. We like to pretend that the United States, like the land of Oz,

23:00.280 --> 23:05.280
divided up into several regions or parts, so that when we hold one on the east coast,

23:05.780 --> 23:10.020
we remember that the Munchkins lived in the east part of Oz, so that's the Munchkins Convention.

23:10.940 --> 23:15.720
And let me hold one in the western part of the United States though, that's where the Winkies lived in Oz.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.920
So we have a Winky convention out in California.

23:19.340 --> 23:22.180
So we divide up into something like that.

23:24.480 --> 23:33.880
We hold four or five conventions to each year, and I have several smaller ones rather than a very large one.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.660
It's easier to get to more locally, I suppose.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.500
I try to get to most of it myself, though not everybody else does.

23:43.920 --> 23:48.540
I would think you have the ideal profession for something like this,

23:48.560 --> 23:53.500
because you're off some in the summer and can spend time with your hobby.

23:54.340 --> 24:00.540
I guess this is really more than a hobby, but at least you get a chance to have some free time to do it.

24:01.080 --> 24:06.420
Yes, that is true. Most conventions are held in the summer, but it is possible for them to get to it.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.160
That's one reason I've been able to do this.

24:12.100 --> 24:17.180
Well, I enjoy doing it. It helps hold the club together a little bit, I guess.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.800
How often do you reread the various books?

24:25.120 --> 24:31.180
Well, I'm looking into them constantly for various points, and research and so on.

24:31.180 --> 24:34.100
To sit down and read them has probably been some time.

24:34.460 --> 24:40.740
I find I recall them fairly well, however, because I'm working with Roz all the time.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.720
But as some of the books I haven't read for some time.

24:51.640 --> 25:00.180
If one of our listeners wanted to join the International Wizard of Oz fan club, what should they do?

25:00.180 --> 25:03.820
Well, I could write to me, as a climate secretary.

25:04.080 --> 25:09.960
Part of my job is to tell people about the club and involve members.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.760
Would you like my address then?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.820
Sure, that would be fine.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.900
My name is Fred Meyer, M-E-Y-E-R.

25:20.340 --> 25:24.880
I live at 220 North 11th Street in Escanaba, Michigan.

25:25.840 --> 25:30.880
Escanaba spelled E-S-C-A-N-A-V-A, Michigan 49-18-9.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.660
I guess Escanaba gets spelled a lot of ways through the years.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.600
Occasionally it's Ozcanaba, but I get the letters anyway.

25:42.120 --> 25:47.340
Would you have any objection if... I don't know what our syndicators think.

25:47.460 --> 25:50.360
I'll have to ask them, but if we put the address on the air, would that be okay?

25:50.740 --> 25:52.180
That would be alright with A-S.

25:53.100 --> 25:59.400
Alright. Well, sir, I enjoyed very much finding out about the Wizard of Oz fan club.

26:00.200 --> 26:04.960
The series, as I mentioned to you, my daughter and I have read it. We're on number nine now.

26:05.180 --> 26:10.100
And it's just delightful. And probably whenever we finish it, I'll start reading it to my son, who's a little younger.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.860
And you may have some converts here.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.120
What's been a pleasure to talk to you.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.900
But we sure appreciate your talking to us.

26:18.900 --> 26:23.580
And lots of luck on finding those collector's items.

26:25.420 --> 26:29.460
I'm a book collector. And if I see anything, I'll let you know.

26:31.280 --> 26:36.520
I don't know how much Oz material made it out to West Texas, but I get around a little bit.

26:36.960 --> 26:42.060
And now I'll keep an eye out for it. I've never really noticed it before.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.560
I'm sure I just have overlooked it.

26:44.140 --> 26:47.100
And so I've discovered something myself here.

26:48.460 --> 26:52.200
Well, great. Again, it's a pleasure talking to you. We sure appreciate it.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.560
Well, I've enjoyed it.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.580
Great. Okay. Take care now.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.700
Talk to you later, I'm sure. Bye-bye now.
