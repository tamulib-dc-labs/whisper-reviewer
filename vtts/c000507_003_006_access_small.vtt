00:01.420 --> 00:07.220
I checked up on my information, and the first thing I did was try to invent planets for

00:07.220 --> 00:07.740
these stars.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.760
That meant I had to figure out the mass so I'd know how far away the planets would, whether

00:12.760 --> 00:17.000
it's the mass and the radiation output, so I'd have to know how far away the planets

00:17.000 --> 00:21.380
and what length of year they'd have, all these little things that make the Department of

00:21.380 --> 00:22.240
Science fiction writing.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.840
These damn plots are in this.

00:26.640 --> 00:34.480
Well, I came up with values from the spectroscopic evidence, and the blasted white stars weren't

00:34.480 --> 00:35.040
big enough.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.780
They weren't massive enough.

00:37.580 --> 00:43.120
And to be as bright as they were, they should have had more mass than they possibly could

00:43.120 --> 00:44.700
have from the spectroscopic data.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.740
And I began scratching my head furiously.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.580
Suddenly I had a brilliant notion, hey, maybe they aren't equal in each of the two systems.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.820
Maybe this is what I'm talking about.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.980
But I'm talking about what the astronomers call the single line binary.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.540
That is, one with one star much brighter than the other, and we get only one set of spectral

01:00.540 --> 01:03.520
lines, and we don't know anything really about the other star at all.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.840
So living, fortunately, in the same metropolis, it's certainly an astrophysicist.

01:09.220 --> 01:16.020
I called up and got a Xerox made of the original paper on the Caster system, which was done

01:16.020 --> 01:19.000
in 1906, and published in the Lick Observatory Bulletin.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.740
And that came with single line velocity curves.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.460
So I had to go and figure out what the stars were really like.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.060
And the next slide I hope, if I didn't get out of order again, gives you a pretty good

01:33.060 --> 01:33.380
idea.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.400
The yellow star in the middle is the sun.

01:39.180 --> 01:47.420
These two are the main components of the other two bright stars in the Caster, and the red

01:47.420 --> 01:54.900
war, this and this, are reasonable values for the other stars.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.380
There are limitations, but this is not a quick thing so it's not air-johns.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.460
We don't know the exact tilt so there's a big range of possible masses that I stuck

02:07.460 --> 02:12.840
within the range which would make the stars too faint to see, and came out with answers

02:12.840 --> 02:14.840
I can't say are right, but are at least reasonable.

02:15.740 --> 02:20.120
The other system, the YY Genonarum Debout Right, this is the pond.

02:20.920 --> 02:30.040
And everything else, there's a couple of other warrants which you wouldn't be able to see from here, which I stuck into the system for purposes of the talk.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.000
This is another of the Star Trek ones.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.460
Okay, finally go.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.400
It's a beautiful system with lots of planets.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.420
I say there are lots of planets.

02:44.820 --> 02:50.160
A lot of science fiction writers, this is not my painting by the way, this is a John Fickson one.

02:51.560 --> 02:59.080
A lot of science fiction writers when they set their stories on planets of other stars just pick the star who named it half as a null,

02:59.520 --> 03:03.840
without any regard to how likely it was to have planets much less habitable once.

03:03.840 --> 03:13.460
And Antares is a frequently used example, since it's a nice bright star seen from Earth or from practically anywhere else.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.100
And there you are.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.040
But there's a little bit of trouble with Antares.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.580
This is probably a pretty accurate painting.

03:22.280 --> 03:30.120
It's a red giant, you can see down through the atmosphere for some distance, but not as far as Paul Anderson once said in one of his stories.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.160
And I'm a little givious about any layer of the atmosphere looking at that, but it might.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.120
I have never been there, can't absolutely guarantee.

03:42.140 --> 03:47.500
But it is a super giant red type, it's in the very late in its career.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.740
If it ever had any habitable Earth type planets, the star has now expanded to engulf us.

03:53.540 --> 03:58.820
And where this world came from, the fiction hooked up, I really don't know.

04:01.800 --> 04:13.540
Antares was mentioned in Star Trek though, and I had to hook up a few possibilities to play the game, and I'm quite sure the next two or three slides deal with some of the possibilities.

04:14.380 --> 04:28.800
I had to basically presume facts that the star is very old, that planets are very old, so I had to hook up a place where they're quite reasonably common.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.640
And I went slightly overboard in typical science fiction writer style.

04:35.140 --> 04:38.300
This is a call going into Antares' photo studio itself.

04:38.920 --> 04:44.560
It's going in well above the local speed of sound, all three of them are, so there are shock waves around it.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.400
The title of the picture was Hot Vacuum, which pretty well describes the outer parts of Antares.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.060
And Paul is going down inside.

04:53.060 --> 04:58.260
Actually, my lifeform had existed on planets now and don't.

04:58.700 --> 05:14.720
At least at the technological level where they could transfer their intelligences, or at least copy themselves adequately into machines of a sort, solid-state devices of many, many cells,

05:14.720 --> 05:20.960
we saw them in something well beyond our present chip technique, but that's the basic idea.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.640
So they were relatively immune to such things as quite wide temperature changes.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.180
They fed on energy directly, and they lived commonly inside the star itself.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.500
So they occasionally had to go out to some of the surviving planets to get material.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.180
Because in a vacuum like that, you don't pick up very much food, and even if you do live off energy,

05:44.080 --> 05:49.440
you can't live in the energy environment at the same temperature as that environment.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.360
You need to eat things somewhere, so they had to leave the star occasionally.

05:53.060 --> 05:59.100
So I made this up for a talk. This is one of these slides that went with it, but I still agree with much the same.

06:00.640 --> 06:07.920
I claim that this was one of those times when the lights had been dimmed, and don't worry about it.

06:07.920 --> 06:13.720
This is an anteroid partly equipped behind one of the surviving building plants.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.140
And there's a big strong, stellar wind coming out from a red giant.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.300
Maybe it'll work. I don't count on it.

06:23.940 --> 06:24.900
It's a little bit better.

06:25.500 --> 06:32.440
This is one of the satellites, and on the satellites, the anteroids had some of their technical equipment,

06:32.740 --> 06:34.180
which they couldn't very well build at the start.

06:34.180 --> 06:42.980
I went and came up with a very brief story about the, you know, the good old Galileo that was always being wrecked by the cattle crafts.

06:43.520 --> 06:48.580
It had to be the Galileo. It went poking around the inner planets and into the star itself.

06:50.420 --> 06:57.860
Okay, then that's one of the natives, and he was very helpful after they got everything settled.

06:57.860 --> 07:03.200
I couldn't find the other slide with that rather of you. That was a native floating around in space.

07:03.900 --> 07:11.040
He had actually was a, just a kid, made an error in judgment without their practically starving.

07:11.880 --> 07:16.180
He got in the enterprise his way, and the enterprise wanted to get around him,

07:16.200 --> 07:20.640
and he wouldn't move and finally required a favor out of him, and got the answer as soon as they needed that.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.040
This was gone through very briefly, I assure you, in the start.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.160
Okay, let's see.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.100
But that said, it sent friendly relations.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.200
Some of the natives and the enterprise went on into the star.

07:39.420 --> 07:45.660
One of the natives protecting the enterprise from slightly excessive radiation intensities,

07:45.660 --> 07:51.760
and eventually found and rescued the crew of the Galileo, and rescued the Galileo.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.440
It's gotta be destroyed if one of the rules.

07:54.780 --> 07:59.580
Okay, that's the final picture I think was the destruction of the cattle crafts.

08:01.540 --> 08:07.200
There's one in a nice negative explosion as the shields went,

08:07.600 --> 08:10.880
and it absorbed a large amount of heat from the gas around it,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.060
and it went for the gas cooled down and stopped radiating,

08:13.500 --> 08:16.660
and it still thinks you get a negative explosion like that under the circumstances.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.040
And if you don't think I'm right, write your own story on that.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.100
Okay.

08:28.700 --> 08:35.620
This was another step I made, so I kind of hope to get into the animated Star Trek stuff,

08:35.620 --> 08:37.860
but it didn't work.

08:38.300 --> 08:43.460
The star is SS Sidney, which is a binary one much like the sun,

08:44.120 --> 08:47.120
the other just above the white dwarf stage.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.000
And every now and then, as material is ejected from the bigger sun,

08:52.160 --> 08:56.380
it falls into the white dwarf, and the heat generated by the fall,

08:56.520 --> 09:02.140
is compressive, makes the small power pop up like it's practically an ova.

09:02.140 --> 09:08.740
The details, the Walter Wadstrom, a two-part article by George Mumford entitled

09:08.740 --> 09:16.300
The Dwarf Novid, the original on-site, appeared in early 1963 with the giant telescope,

09:17.300 --> 09:19.020
and that was the part of it.

09:19.400 --> 09:26.280
The next picture shows it's blazing in this little novice-sized behavior,

09:28.880 --> 09:32.360
and the next picture shows the planet that hooked up to the storm.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.120
It's here in the clean water world, practically solid water,

09:36.600 --> 09:40.340
water for about 2,000 miles, and I worked out an excuse for that,

09:40.520 --> 09:41.760
but let's not go into it now.

09:43.220 --> 09:44.680
It's all the 50s.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.040
One of them, carbon-side life, has developed.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.820
The other, the sea, had a lot of dissolved ionic material, dissolved salt,

09:52.820 --> 09:58.420
and the life forms were metal-cryptoloids, electrical stuff,

09:58.900 --> 10:04.320
and the life on the carbon world, as the just-diamond developed space travel,

10:04.460 --> 10:10.400
had dropped a few poles over onto the other world, not properly decontaminated,

10:11.000 --> 10:17.900
and the metal beings were having to set up a major industry in what they thought of as the flying control center,

10:19.120 --> 10:23.640
destroying the stuff that was spreading over their oceans and cutting off the sunlight they needed.

10:24.860 --> 10:27.740
Okay, the story has never been finished.

10:29.260 --> 10:29.980
I'm very ready.

10:30.740 --> 10:34.180
That's from the surface of one of the planets, looking at the other,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.460
during a partial eclipse.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.400
The shadow of the world you're on is falling on the planet you're looking at.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.720
That's the ready story.

10:45.160 --> 10:52.760
Okay, the next one is pretty much the same source, but the tunnel in the other direction is just coming out from behind.

10:53.300 --> 10:59.220
But most of the planets you're on is now in sunlight, so we see this reflected in the ocean, so it's up here.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.000
Okay.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.680
That was another one that never went very far.

11:12.900 --> 11:19.280
The system is D444-Signal, an ecliptic system of which one part is at W7,

11:19.940 --> 11:23.400
the other is about an old three or four,

11:23.400 --> 11:26.420
two of the hottest objects that shine.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.660
Probably extremely young stars.

11:30.580 --> 11:34.980
I had to cook up an excuse for planets there, and I couldn't think of any.

11:35.580 --> 11:39.240
And finally I decided, planets no, comets yes,

11:40.140 --> 11:47.380
and the comet that was found had been visited a few thousand years before,

11:47.380 --> 11:52.060
because after all, any objects like that would be interesting to a safe traveling race.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.860
And the comet had been hauled out in a lot of research and equipment last minute,

11:58.280 --> 12:03.720
and that's mainly looking inside the comet, which as Fred Ripple says, is a sense of ice.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.520
Now it's a set of hollowed out, and the comet is lying there,

12:07.740 --> 12:13.180
and it's very high to make out any details, but that's reasonable because if you're there, you wouldn't have trouble making out details.

12:13.180 --> 12:17.320
You're inside ice, eliminated from outside, hence the greenest color,

12:17.980 --> 12:21.500
and there are tunnels and tables and kitchen machinery.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.600
I called it labyrinth, so let's go grab.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.760
I haven't seen any bodies.

12:28.860 --> 12:29.740
Okay, next one.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.880
That was when I was cooking around the vicinity of Rydall,

12:39.700 --> 12:44.800
and a ship was doing some mining on a fairly solid metal asteroid

12:44.800 --> 12:47.520
which had condensed way in fairly close to the star.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.820
Rydall's about 150,000 times as bright as the sun,

12:50.960 --> 12:53.660
and it's like 50,000 or so, we don't know how far away it is.

12:54.220 --> 12:57.880
And that star in, if anything, condensed the tall, it would be metal.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.140
So the assumption was that you'd give your mining in the neighborhood

13:03.140 --> 13:07.540
where Rydall's prominent could get at you if you weren't careful.

13:09.160 --> 13:09.660
Okay.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.700
I think you could make a lot of stories about the life of those miners,

13:16.900 --> 13:17.980
never mind going any further.

13:18.820 --> 13:23.280
That was another one I did for the episode, The Apple,

13:23.480 --> 13:27.160
the one where that leftover computer that looked like a reptile

13:27.160 --> 13:31.020
was keeping people going and defending itself.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.340
Well, there obviously had to be another climate system

13:33.340 --> 13:36.480
which had another such device on it,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.740
but there's no reason for all being there.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.880
So this is a satellite of a Jolyon-type planet further out in the distance.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.660
The star is about life-serious, so it had to be a visual further out.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.660
The Jolyon planet had to be hot enough to keep the satellite habitable,

13:52.060 --> 13:55.360
and this is a satellite partly lightened by the star

13:55.360 --> 14:00.980
and partly lightened by the tall red hot planet down to the lower right.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.420
And there's a few thousand more,

14:04.520 --> 14:06.740
a million more square miles to write stories on.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.880
Am I anywhere near infinity yet?

14:09.980 --> 14:10.460
Keep going.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.840
That's from surface to one of the satellites

14:17.840 --> 14:22.220
looking at the tall red hot planet, partly illuminated by

14:22.220 --> 14:24.640
the star down a triangle there.

14:26.280 --> 14:26.880
Okay.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.640
I don't see somebody near the end.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.580
Don't gotta talk to her, anyway.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.880
Oh, yeah, that's gotta be modern.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.120
The mass pertains to dinner.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.860
What's over in the middle of that hall there?

14:50.860 --> 14:51.580
Black hole.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.080
Getting close to a red dwarf star,

14:55.700 --> 14:57.980
close enough for tidal forces to go into action,

14:58.220 --> 14:59.960
material being pulled out of the star,

14:59.960 --> 15:03.120
falling into the black hole as it falls

15:03.120 --> 15:05.040
potential energy showing up its kinetic,

15:05.240 --> 15:08.460
so it's radiating X-rays and anything else you care to name.

15:09.180 --> 15:12.100
I don't know if the black hole is actually going to hit the star

15:12.100 --> 15:13.580
and clean it all up or not,

15:13.800 --> 15:15.860
but I painted the picture a little too oily.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.220
But black holes are showing up in stories

15:20.220 --> 15:23.000
and there are lots of things that can be done with them

15:23.000 --> 15:24.020
that haven't been done yet,

15:24.280 --> 15:27.540
especially as Hawkins Fellows just decided

15:27.540 --> 15:28.620
they're not that permanent.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.720
They can lose their mass by tunneling effects.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.500
It's the laws of quantum mechanics that are true.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.660
Not very effectively.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.240
It doesn't lend itself to verbal explanation.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.820
The reason the black hole supposedly couldn't let anything out

15:45.820 --> 15:49.580
was that the velocity of the gate is greater than the speed of light

15:49.580 --> 15:52.920
and even protons can't make it.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.280
Quantum mechanics is a statistical field

15:57.140 --> 15:59.280
at trie.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.460
What's the whole reason for that?

16:04.940 --> 16:09.660
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at least with my way up to here.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.200
A radioactive material, a beta ray of matter that

16:13.200 --> 16:15.260
kicked out electrons, theoretically should.

16:15.980 --> 16:18.860
The electrons are inside, or part-op, neutrons

16:18.860 --> 16:21.740
which are inside the nucleus which is positively charged.

16:22.420 --> 16:25.660
And the attractive field that that electron

16:25.660 --> 16:30.040
would have to go out against is more than it should be able to pass.

16:31.100 --> 16:35.940
But quantum mechanics says you don't have a continuous state of affairs.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.020
This energy state is possible, this energy state is possible,

16:40.180 --> 16:41.600
this energy state is possible.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.300
Most people are familiar with this in the electron arrangement of atoms

16:46.300 --> 16:48.200
that they had in high-field chemistry of the light.

16:48.780 --> 16:51.760
Well, the same sort of thing apparently applies inside the nuclei,

16:51.940 --> 16:55.120
though I know a hell of a lot less about the energy levels

16:55.120 --> 16:56.340
that they're supposed to be there.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.880
But whether or not something will actually get through that potential barrier

17:01.880 --> 17:03.540
is a statistical matter.

17:04.060 --> 17:09.660
And it's heavy and badly designed nuclei, uranium and radium and materials like that,

17:09.860 --> 17:10.820
that sort of stuff.

17:11.460 --> 17:20.520
There is a possibility that a particle will find itself outside the nucleus

17:20.520 --> 17:23.480
without having actually claimed the potential wall.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.940
And they call this phenomenon tunneling.

17:26.820 --> 17:33.120
And theoretically, if the quantum rules apply, they will also apply the black hole.

17:33.700 --> 17:37.440
And apparently, according to an article in I think last month's Scientific American,

17:38.640 --> 17:41.800
these disposals of the micro-black holes, once and for all,

17:41.920 --> 17:46.160
if they were formed 10 billion years ago as a big bang at the start of the universe,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.100
they're radiated away by now.

17:48.900 --> 17:53.880
But the probability gets very much smaller as the black hole gets more and more massive.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.860
And a free-solar mass black hole supposedly would take something like 10 to the

17:58.860 --> 18:01.160
66th power years to radiate away.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.460
So it's a fairly permanent object.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.960
However, if you want to find some way in your story of making use of quantum effects,

18:10.540 --> 18:14.220
and God knows that's just another of the things that we've been using for fact,

18:14.220 --> 18:18.140
that light travels for years, maybe you can hop in and out now.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.040
Go ahead, you like the story.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.980
Well, whether or not the universe is all going to wind up in black holes,

18:33.760 --> 18:40.260
it still seems pretty probable that the black holes will then continue spreading apart indefinitely.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.100
And gradually, and I do mean gradually,

18:44.580 --> 18:48.880
radiate their contents away again, and what you have after that I don't know.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.440
I'll let her to hawk and see.

18:52.480 --> 18:52.820
Okay.

18:57.700 --> 19:03.460
Some stories, I'm not sure I put that in upside down, I don't look like it.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.140
Some paintings tell their own stories.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.660
We don't have to write a story around it, but you can.

19:11.280 --> 19:18.120
This one was entitled Sub-Satellite, and it's upside down from the way I had it in mind when I painted it.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.420
And there's a wrecked ship on full bus up there, and Mars is in the background,

19:22.740 --> 19:24.500
and it's like the wrecked man in the foreground.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.100
The whole thing tells its own story.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.380
Some of the later ones are a bit better when it's hopped onto them.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.080
Especially in the story they tell.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.180
Sometimes it's rubbish.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.500
I call that one communication gap.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.500
One take a lot of the audience, doesn't it?

19:46.340 --> 19:52.280
They just happened to be an Afro-Pod, and figured that there was some fair chance of communicating,

19:52.680 --> 19:56.140
as the highest life you could find, which is also an Afro-Pod.

19:56.140 --> 20:01.260
The fact that he arrived somewhere in the middle of Tambourine, and they all cried.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.580
Anyone want to write that story, go right ahead.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.640
That doesn't project very well.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.180
The title was, Almond.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.880
It's supposed to be Sunrise Sky, Reflection and Water down there,

20:20.480 --> 20:25.200
and a moon hanging just between two other suns in the system.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.380
The painting looks a lot better in this slide.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.520
Let's go on.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.440
Again, it doesn't go very well.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.400
I have it which I suspect is bad artistically.

20:43.960 --> 20:49.260
A painting, a picture in which the key element can't be seen until you lean over and look rather closely.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.060
This one was called Seconds Can.

20:52.060 --> 20:59.060
And the planet is the Earth, and down here in the rock is a fossil human storm.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
Sorry, it doesn't show better.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.140
Let's see if the next one does, in all its hope.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.480
That isn't a story, but curses.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.460
It's meant to be a scientifically-prolegged illustration of a T-towry star.

21:21.980 --> 21:29.180
A star just at the point in the contraction of the original nebula, where the hydrogen-fusing fire had lighted.

21:29.640 --> 21:33.220
And there's still a lot of gas and dust which hasn't fallen into the sun.

21:33.800 --> 21:41.020
A wildly irregular object, partly we think because the actual radiation output is still varying wildly,

21:41.020 --> 21:47.060
and partly because there's a lot of the obscuring matter still around it with occasionally blocked off the radiation.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.520
You shouldn't be able to write a story about a star there.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.140
But you should be able to write a story about it.

21:58.960 --> 22:03.840
Okay, that came out of my Rigel talk for Star Trek.

22:03.840 --> 22:11.600
This is a Rigel B off the background, but I think it was about Rigel 14 looking at it.

22:15.260 --> 22:19.480
Okay, I'll describe Rigel 14 if you want. Just write me a note.

22:19.920 --> 22:26.900
I'll tell you how far, I think I can find my notes on how far out it was, and how many centuries it was, and all that sort of stuff.

22:28.200 --> 22:38.400
Okay, another not quite sun-lit world situation, but it's the planet of a red dwarf star which has evaporated out of the galaxy.

22:39.400 --> 22:48.320
And thus, dynamic encounters, you tend to distribute kinetic energy equally among stars just as you do among molecules in a gas cloud.

22:48.320 --> 22:58.340
And there's a good deal of theoretical reason to suspect that there are a lot of low-mass stars and low-mass objects in the space between the galaxies.

22:58.980 --> 23:03.420
Whether there's enough to bring the universe back together again, nobody's sure.

23:03.940 --> 23:08.860
At the moment, all we know is all the stuff we know isn't enough, and it's expanding for good.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.280
Okay.

23:14.920 --> 23:19.540
I didn't change this one, and I never tried to write a story about it.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.060
The star is the binary system you set it.

23:23.840 --> 23:34.540
And one star is a blue main-shape one giant, and the other is an F-yellow, so much hotter than the sun.

23:34.540 --> 23:45.600
Not quite super-giant about luminosity class two, and presumably, judging by the fact that some of these data are close enough together to be carrying math out of each other,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.760
and what that would do to any planet they may have, enjoy yourself. I'm not gonna bother with it.

23:51.560 --> 23:51.960
Okay.

23:57.980 --> 24:03.200
Data-lyrate has been used repeatedly. That's the sixth and the ninth time.

24:04.100 --> 24:08.660
And if anyone has read Larry Hibben's soft weapon, they've gotten the verbal description.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.660
Actually, he went by Bonifacelle's painting, but it doesn't matter the paintings or the lights.

24:13.180 --> 24:20.380
The only fact here is that the brighter of those stars is a D-type main-shape star about three times the pop of the sun.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.680
The other object we don't know has been products to be an F-type star.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.760
I've read the one paper in which they thought it might be a black hole.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.180
This is, of course, that the black hole is that popular.

24:32.780 --> 24:40.240
And the special evidence suggests that you've got this spiral of gas being ejected from one star,

24:40.640 --> 24:46.260
pulled towards the other, but all of the motion is so fast that some of it misses and goes spiraling merrily out of the system.

24:46.700 --> 24:50.740
The fling shot affects the same thing that's ascending the Pioneer 10 out of the solar system.

24:50.740 --> 24:55.840
The only catch in the picture is you couldn't begin to look in that direction,

24:56.180 --> 25:02.560
with a star of that temperature in front of you, and you would never see that red hydrogen spiral.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.980
No way. It's not bright enough.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.860
However, it's a nice painting and it made a nice story.

25:09.980 --> 25:10.480
Next one.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.240
The name's gonna keep on over.

25:21.180 --> 25:28.340
The blue-white star is the one that's exploded and now is shrinking rapidly down to the white dwarf or neutron star,

25:28.420 --> 25:31.960
or a black hole, depending on what its mass is, as it's specified.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.660
Part of the binary system, the other star is the red giant.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.240
We'll go the same way in another 30 years or so.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.560
The kind of foreground that got well posted during the explosion.

25:45.120 --> 25:45.480
Next.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.180
Yep.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.720
Probably not.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.800
Oh, it won't matter, away from it, but not all of it.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.840
The next algal, the human star, the flinger, is the victim's painting.

26:01.920 --> 26:06.580
More or less correct, a little bit more of a blurb, you can't live it, was, if you had the dimensions way off.

26:06.580 --> 26:10.160
The star we see is a very significant speed.

26:11.060 --> 26:17.620
The star that does the acoustic, the quicksand, is a k-type for a sub-giant, and is a third star in the distance.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.980
Somewhere out about the distance of Jupiter.

26:20.860 --> 26:27.040
And I did a little bit of thinking about a planet for that system one time, and you can have this one free,

26:27.220 --> 26:28.660
and I'll describe the planet for you.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.060
The next picture is a scene on it.

26:32.060 --> 26:40.920
Because of the third star, I had to put it a little too far out to be kept at a comfortable temperature by algal if it looked like that.

26:41.760 --> 26:46.120
If it had been far enough in, the third star would have ruined its orbit, but probably.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.860
So I decided, okay, let's spread greenhouses up to a decent temperature.

26:52.360 --> 27:00.220
So it's got a nice hollow cloud envelope like seen here, and its natives are just getting to the stage where they are being plantists,

27:00.220 --> 27:04.440
and this group has gotten above the cloud layer.

27:04.720 --> 27:14.920
The first picture is a completely unused sunlight, and algal A is partly an eclipse, and they're in trouble if it comes out from the eclipse before very long.

27:15.420 --> 27:19.460
The next star is there, and the other one is hidden behind the accumulus top,

27:19.920 --> 27:24.640
because unlike Chesley Bonestell and some other artists who can call themselves artists,

27:25.340 --> 27:29.380
I let my scientific prejudice affect my artistic life.

27:29.380 --> 27:33.380
I don't paint a picture of what you're looking straight at at these types of stars.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.300
You know, damn well you couldn't see it, you couldn't see anything else.

27:36.900 --> 27:42.280
So I hid the blue star behind this companion, and I hid the other star,

27:42.360 --> 27:46.560
who's type I don't know but which I'm sure is too hot to look at straight, behind the clouds.

27:47.340 --> 27:50.940
That's me. I mean, with artistic license, you can do these things.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.360
I'm a scientist, not an artist. Sorry about that.

27:55.160 --> 27:59.200
Okay, but if you want that planet, go right ahead.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.280
Also, what are the things you can do with it?

28:01.740 --> 28:03.200
People look a little like tentacles.

28:04.220 --> 28:11.840
They evolved in shallow oceans in tidal regions with very heavy weed beds,

28:12.580 --> 28:16.360
and the centipede structure involved climbing and moving around,

28:16.600 --> 28:21.120
but tides went up and down, and they were sometimes in the air, sometimes not,

28:21.120 --> 28:26.700
and the general rugged environment was what selected for intelligence there.

28:27.020 --> 28:32.580
I used the same thing in the Teller 2 story, Stuck With It, but it was a different planet.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.500
And that, I think the last of the slides,

28:36.140 --> 28:43.200
remember when Glace decided that Mr. Stuck's homeworld Vulcan was a planet of 40 aerodinies?

28:44.280 --> 28:47.100
Well, I went along with this. I mean, I'm stuck with it.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.720
And it's in the period in books. 40 aerodinies is a triple star.

28:52.220 --> 28:59.680
The main body of the system is about at K3, about 30% as bright as the sun,

28:59.820 --> 29:05.520
and I decided that that's where Vulcan had better defects, certainly, closer in,

29:05.620 --> 29:08.220
because Vulcan has been stated to be hotter than the Earth,

29:08.820 --> 29:12.500
and therefore it has a shorter year whether Jim was willing to admit it or not.

29:12.500 --> 29:18.220
The other two stars are rather interesting there, but brighter one is a white dwarf.
