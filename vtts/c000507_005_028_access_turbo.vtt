00:29.040 --> 00:34.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.040
And here are your hosts.

00:43.760 --> 00:53.080
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. If there's such a thing as a science fiction
connoisseur, he would have to be a Jack Vance fan. Vance is a distinctive author

00:53.080 --> 01:01.400
who's been writing science fiction and fantasy since the 1940s. And even in a
field like science fiction, Vance's imagination is remarkable. His depiction of

01:01.400 --> 01:09.320
alien worlds, for instance, impresses any reader. He has a powerful, subtle
style, and with the colors and textures of his descriptions, and his careful

01:09.320 --> 01:16.760
attention to the resources of language, he can make you believe you're on
another planet, somehow involved in an alien culture. We might mention the

01:16.760 --> 01:26.420
Durdane Trilogy or the Four Novels of the Tschai or Planet of Adventure series as
examples of Vance's skill at creating alien environments and cultures. Vance

01:26.420 --> 01:38.860
always wanted to be a writer, and he chose science fiction for the simplest of
reasons. Well, first, I toyed with the idea of my life. And I wanted to find

01:38.860 --> 01:56.080
some way of making a living where I could travel, be my own boss, work my own
hours. And I knew writing was the way that suggested itself. And so I kind of,

01:56.780 --> 02:09.560
even when I was old, maybe 10 or 12 years old, I kind of told myself I kind of
liked to be a writer. Why I chose science fiction, I don't know. Or fantasy,

02:09.640 --> 02:17.480
whatever you want to call it. When I was a kid, I'd done a lot of reading. Well,
I've done a lot of reading and everything, as far as acting.

02:21.380 --> 02:35.980
But I think I'm probably more touched by, or not influenced is the word, but
influenced, I guess you might say, by fantasy

02:35.980 --> 02:48.700
and the so-called science fiction, rather than by much anything else. As we've
said, Vance started back in the 1940s, in the pulp magazines, and his early work

02:48.700 --> 03:00.160
lacks the polish and distinctive flair that he's known for. I was learning my
traits. I just got started writing, not real young, you know, like some guys

03:00.160 --> 03:11.360
did. In fact, I was doing lots of other things. And then I decided I was going
to be a writer, and I started writing. And I had old talibs for it, I guess,

03:11.500 --> 03:25.260
apparently. But I didn't have the knack or the practice, or whatever you want to
call it, of putting the words together. And also, I was trying

03:25.260 --> 03:38.080
to write the wrong kind of story. Those days, the gadget story was very big. And
I wasted a lot of time trying to write gadget stories on scientific

03:38.080 --> 03:56.740
breakthroughs and things like that, which is essentially kind of a lined alley,
I think. And it's a phase of the field which has mercifully gone over the hill.

03:57.540 --> 04:11.020
I've got a very good scientific background. It's not that I don't know science,
I do. I was going to be a physicist, actually, for a while. In the 40s and 50s,

04:11.020 --> 04:27.760
I was writing and experimenting, collecting rejection slips. And that was an
apprentice period in which I

04:27.760 --> 04:39.780
was paid not very much for, but, you know, checked once in a while. But
essentially, those 40 and 50 stories are not much good. They're not worth it.

04:41.880 --> 04:51.380
I'll just soon forget them. Vance's apprenticeship must have been well spent.
The science fiction and fantasy he's been writing ever since is masterful. In

04:51.380 --> 05:01.880
1963, he won the Hugo Award for The Dragon Masters. And in 1966, he won both the
Nebula and Hugo Awards for The Last Castle. Tomorrow, more with Jack Vance.

05:09.640 --> 05:17.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:17.660 --> 05:18.440
Odessa, Texas.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.420
Goodさco.

05:59.580 --> 06:03.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:19.360 --> 06:24.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.040
And here are your hosts.

06:33.860 --> 06:42.980
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. Jack Vance has created a unique, vivid, and
fascinating body of science fiction and fantasy. He began his career in the pulp

06:42.980 --> 06:50.740
magazines of the 1940s, and he wrote the gadget stories that were popular then.
But over the years, he's developed a deeper, more subtle, and distinctive type

06:50.740 --> 06:58.720
of science fiction and fantasy. Yet the curious fact is that not many people,
even science fiction readers, have heard of Jack Vance. We asked him why he

06:58.720 --> 07:14.740
thought that was so. I think another thing, too, that I've developed rather
gradually and reached my presence, whatever you want to call it, by a kind of

07:14.740 --> 07:30.520
back way, inconspicuously. I've never... Clark is known for 2001. Heinlein,
Stranger in a Strange Land, or whatever, children's books, or through Campbell.

07:35.260 --> 07:53.560
And it's... It's... I've never been associated with anything that had any other
publicity attached to it. So I just seem to arrive on the scene. And so it seems

07:53.560 --> 08:06.280
to me, if I were looking at my own career in this way, kind of quietly from...
from... from... northeast somewhere. Rather than... through... through having...

08:06.280 --> 08:18.320
a... a movie or... or something or something. Lately, Vance has been writing
three, four, and even five novel series set on alien planets. He's noted for his

08:18.320 --> 08:26.180
imaginative descriptions of alien settings and cultures more than anything else.
The four books in the Chai series, or the Dordain trilogy, are good examples of

08:26.180 --> 08:34.540
stories set in convincingly alien environments. Vance is also recognized for the
stories in the Dying Earth series. And don't forget, Vance has written excellent

08:34.540 --> 08:43.840
mystery fiction, even winning the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of
America in 1960 for his book The Man in the Cage. Even though some readers talk

08:43.840 --> 08:54.260
of a unique Vance style, Vance himself says he has no particular style or
writing characteristics. I don't have any style. All I do is try to write

08:54.260 --> 09:07.440
whatever in the best possible way. Now, if you take the trouble to read some of
my murder mysteries, you'll find that they're written in a different way.

09:08.620 --> 09:20.840
Everything you write, everything I write, everything anybody writes, the style
or the way the words are put together is part of the mood of the story. It is

09:20.840 --> 09:35.700
part of the story itself. It's part of the completed product. Now, when you say,
how did I evolve this, that implies that I have one style that I use for

09:35.700 --> 09:54.900
everything from this early Dying Earth thing up to one of this mystery story
with Locallum in the countryside out here called Fox Valley Murders. If you take

09:54.900 --> 10:04.100
the trouble to examine the way the words are put together, you'll find it
totally different. Also, like in Bad Ronald, which is a suspense story, the way

10:04.100 --> 10:13.300
that the words go together are different from the way the words go together. You
say, oh, I don't know what. No, I don't have any style.

10:21.080 --> 10:30.540
Vance considers himself a storyteller or entertainer with no axes to grind. He's
reluctant to provide explanations or analyses of his work. When asked about a

10:30.540 --> 10:40.400
particular character or episode in one of his works, Vance has a characteristic
reply. Well, I think everybody will have to answer that for themselves. Reading

10:40.400 --> 10:46.480
the science fiction of Jack Vance makes answering questions like that
worthwhile. More with Jack Vance tomorrow.

10:53.700 --> 11:01.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:01.720 --> 11:03.600
Odessa, Texas. .

11:44.120 --> 11:48.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.260 --> 12:09.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.940
And here are your hosts.

12:18.500 --> 12:27.760
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. The dying Earth stories of Jack Vance, one
of the most exquisite creations in the realm of science fantasy. The setting for

12:27.760 --> 12:36.540
the stories is a bit unusual. It's Earth, but an Earth so many millions of
centuries into the future that it's almost dead. And so is the sun, sputtering

12:36.540 --> 12:44.640
like a candle ready to go out and bathing Earth in its final pale red light.
There are only a few people left on Earth, and most of these are sorcerers,

12:44.780 --> 12:54.520
since magic works and science has been forgotten. Vance says that the dying
Earth stories are some of the earliest things he ever wrote. Well, the funny

12:54.520 --> 13:06.920
thing about it is that was written before I'd started selling. That was written
at sea, as well as merchant sea. And I had quite a bit of a spare time, and I

13:06.920 --> 13:13.420
began writing these flamboyant,

13:13.500 --> 13:30.160
highly colored stories. But those were written, oh, very, very early. They were
written before I'd even started selling. So they're just representative of a

13:30.160 --> 13:34.080
kind of rather early stage.

13:35.400 --> 13:47.860
And then when I started writing this so-called gadget fiction or other stuff, I
changed the style. The style of this dying Earth stuff wasn't at all suitable

13:47.860 --> 14:00.520
for writing the stuff I began selling. The stuff I was selling was any good,
because it wasn't. But at least the style of the dying Earth would have been

14:00.520 --> 14:05.840
absolutely, what's

14:05.840 --> 14:10.280
the word, incongruous. It wouldn't have fitted, so I used a different style.

14:22.260 --> 14:30.080
Many readers believe the style of the stories, which Vance calls flamboyant and
highly colored, to be the most marvelous and vivid thing about them. It creates

14:30.080 --> 14:38.020
an exotic yet wistful atmosphere, somehow appropriate for a world on the edge of
extinction. Tim Underwood is a friend of Vance's, and along with Chuck Miller,

14:38.280 --> 14:46.020
publishes Vance's work in specially made collector's editions. The Underwood
-Miller Publishing Company's first book was The Dying Earth. We asked Tim

14:46.020 --> 15:00.820
Underwood why. A lot of science fiction and fantasy, and sometimes the best of
it, does not get published in hardcover editions. And The Dying Earth was the

15:00.820 --> 15:14.860
first book we did, and it was just a book that is essentially a classic. It was
published in 1950 as a paperback, and it had never been in hardcover. And it's

15:14.860 --> 15:23.900
just one of the outstanding books in the fantasy field, and 200 years from now
people will be reading it. And it had never been in a durable hardcover edition,

15:23.960 --> 15:25.140
and so we put it in one.

15:32.740 --> 15:41.420
Vance didn't write any new Dying Earth material for 15 years after the book's
original publication in 1950. We asked him if it was perhaps reader responses,

15:41.440 --> 15:56.680
which caused him to take it up again. No, it's been, I don't, I just always
wanted to do some more stuff in there. Uh, and this character was, uh, swarming

15:56.680 --> 15:57.500
around in my head.

16:14.780 --> 16:22.780
The character swarming around in his head was Kugel, a picaresque rogue who
survived on the dying earth through his wits and his nimble fingers. The Kugel

16:22.780 --> 16:31.440
stories were collected in 1966 in a book entitled The Eyes of the Overworld.
Since then, Vance has written other Kugel stories and says he'll do more in the

16:31.440 --> 16:35.940
future, so the dying earth isn't dead yet. More on Jack Vance tomorrow.

16:43.420 --> 16:51.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:51.420 --> 16:52.180
Odessa, Texas.

17:10.960 --> 17:21.960
The Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:22.140 --> 17:22.160
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.160
of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:52.180 --> 17:57.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.860
And here are your hosts.

18:06.160 --> 18:14.640
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. Jack Vance is one of the major talents that
the field of fantasy and science fiction has produced. Tim Underwood, his friend

18:14.640 --> 18:25.900
and publisher, offers some reasons why. I think Jack has accomplished some
things with some of his works that have just never been done before. Not only in

18:25.900 --> 18:41.860
terms of style, but in terms of feeling. And he hearkens to a certain spirit, I
think. I mean, a certain kind of person or a certain kind of spirit is on his

18:41.860 --> 18:55.420
wavelength and responds strongly to his work. But the latter part of his work
and the best of his work is extremely well crafted. He's a craftsman, very well

18:55.420 --> 19:05.940
written, and accomplishes a lot of really unusual things in a very quiet way.
Vance's accomplishments have been impressive. His science fiction career spans

19:05.940 --> 19:13.980
almost 40 years and began back in the pulp era. He's won the major awards for a
science fiction and fantasy writer. One is the Hugo Award, awarded by readers,

19:14.220 --> 19:22.180
and the other is a Nebula Award, given by other writers. Some of his best-known
work includes the Dying Earth stories, which go all the way back to his

19:22.180 --> 19:31.140
beginnings as a writer in the 40s, and more recently the five Demon Princes
novels. Still, Vance hasn't received much recognition. We asked Underwood why.

19:32.420 --> 19:37.580
My feeling is that one

19:37.580 --> 19:52.040
responds strongly to Vance, one who feels much the same way about the world that
he does. And I think, why isn't he, though, as popular as, say, John Lycoray,

19:52.320 --> 20:00.240
who I think people respond to in the same way? Well, Vance is more of a rarefied
taste, I think.

20:03.160 --> 20:14.340
He's the kind of things that he feels are important. The strangeness in the
world about us and the unusual qualities of life itself, those kind of

20:14.340 --> 20:25.940
considerations are not important to a lot of people. People who do feel these
things strongly are going to like what Vance writes. They're going to enjoy

20:25.940 --> 20:34.800
reading. They're going to enjoy the worlds that he's created. He's not done a
lot of the things that make other writers successful, like he's never stayed

20:34.800 --> 20:52.520
with one character, the way, let's say, Le Carré stayed with Smiley. Or the way
that someone writes a Doc Savage novel 15 times in a row or whatever. He hasn't

20:52.520 --> 21:09.520
done that. And he hasn't had one hero that he's repeated for any great number of
books. And he hasn't had one contemporary theme that appeals to people, like the

21:09.520 --> 21:24.960
battle of the sexes or something like that. Those aren't Jack's themes. Jack's
consideration themes are enormously subtle and kind of a rarefied nature. Vance

21:24.960 --> 21:34.120
has always been reluctant to discuss his own work or to offer any insights into
his themes or intentions. Underwood suggests a reason. Jack always says that he

21:34.120 --> 21:46.640
wants his work to stand for and by itself. I think he just wants to be
remembered for his work. He refuses to pick favorites among his work. I know he

21:46.640 --> 22:01.280
likes his Demon Prince series a lot for good reason. He likes The Palace of
Love, which is the third in that series. He likes The Eyes of the Overworld, the

22:01.280 --> 22:16.020
sequenced stories of the fellow Kugel. And that's partly because Kugel's a
rascal. And Vance himself is a bit of a rascal. And Kugel's even more so. He's

22:16.020 --> 22:22.440
the kind of rascal that Vance would like to be if he wasn't such a nice guy at
heart.

22:29.800 --> 22:37.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:37.800 --> 22:38.560
Odessa, Texas.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.700
and Kugel's a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

23:18.660 --> 23:22.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:38.340 --> 23:43.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.240
And here are your hosts.

23:52.480 --> 24:01.580
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. In 1975, a science fiction and fantasy
publishing company was formed because two men wanted to get one particular

24:01.580 --> 24:15.560
science fantasy book between hardcovers. Tim Underwood, one of the men,
explains. In 1975, I decided I wanted to publish a book. Specifically, I wanted

24:15.560 --> 24:27.860
to publish The Dying Earth in a hardcover form. And I was a used book dealer,
and Chuck Miller was a used book dealer, dealing in rare and out-of-print books

24:27.860 --> 24:41.420
and some new material. And we knew of each other. And I think we had bought and
sold books from each other from time to time. And Chuck heard about, I may have

24:41.420 --> 24:51.640
mentioned in a letter about The Dying Earth. And Chuck offered his expertise
because he knew a good deal about certain parts of publishing industry, about

24:51.640 --> 25:05.500
distribution and that end of it. And my experience, my limited experience, had
to do with just graphically putting a book together. And so he suggested that we

25:05.500 --> 25:16.320
do the book together. And so we did. And the interesting thing is that we never
met each other until the book had already been published. And that was a year

25:16.320 --> 25:17.800
later in 1976.

25:20.300 --> 25:32.340
And up to that time, we were literally exchanging thousands of dollars through
the mail and doing business without ever having met each other. We were, in a

25:32.340 --> 25:42.300
sense, complete strangers. But we had this one connection, and that is we both
felt strongly about this one work of Vance's The Dying Earth and about Vance's

25:42.300 --> 25:52.640
work in general and specifically about fantasy and science fiction and horror
and literature. Since that first book, the Underwood Miller Company has

25:52.640 --> 26:01.380
published some 50 books, all science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Their print
runs for each volume average 1,000 copies, hardly enough to compete with the

26:01.380 --> 26:11.840
large New York publishers. Underwood explains why. We're selling to collectors,
and the collectors are buying these books with the knowledge that they're going

26:11.840 --> 26:28.340
to go out of print and become valuable later on. Another reason is that Chuck
and I don't own a warehouse, and we are not in business to have a large

26:28.340 --> 26:39.220
inventory. We would make more money if we printed more books, because as you
print more books, the cost per book of manufacturing goes down dramatically.

26:42.720 --> 26:52.640
But we just simply can't afford to have a lot of books in inventory sitting
around. We can't afford... Our books go out of print in about nine months, and

26:52.640 --> 27:03.200
this is just the opposite of a major manufacturer, like Dutton or Brown or
someone like that. They want their book to stay in print as long as possible,

27:03.360 --> 27:06.820
and we want our books to go out of print as soon as possible.

27:14.580 --> 27:23.420
Tim Underwood and Chuck Miller have a sincere interest in significant works of
science fiction and fantasy. It's not just the pleasure of bookmaking. Just the

27:23.420 --> 27:35.220
pleasure. Chuck and I both take a great pleasure in making a good book, a book
that has its signature sewn, which is something that doesn't occur in general

27:35.220 --> 27:46.660
trade hardcover publishing anymore, a book that's printed on acid-free paper so
that in 20 or 30 years the paper won't turn brittle and brown, and just a well

27:46.660 --> 27:57.000
-made, well-bound book, attractively made and artistically put together. And
publishing a book like that, creating a book like that, is really a pleasure.

27:58.360 --> 28:05.440
Underwood and Miller are publishing books by many authors in beautifully
illustrated editions now. Anyone who likes fantasy and science fiction, and

28:05.440 --> 28:09.000
anyone who likes books, should search out some of their work and hold on to it.
