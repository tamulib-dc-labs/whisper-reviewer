WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:01.969
Okay.

00:04.512 --> 00:05.192
Okay, we're rolling. Okay, I am very unknowledgeable about collectors, so some of the questions I'm going to ask you are 
pretty basic. All right, that's fine. I assume many of your listeners will be the same. Right, exactly. Okay, the first

00:20.891 --> 00:23.054
question is a pretty obvious one. Can you just briefly tell me how you got started as a collector? Well, I guess we have to 
go back quite a ways. I... got interested in science fiction in high school, as many people do, and once I started finding

00:30.642 --> 00:51.313
that, hey, out there in the big world they have newsstands that sell books, why I bought everything that I could get my 
hands on for many, many years, and I really got started as a serious collector, however. I have my wife to thank for that,

00:51.333 --> 00:59.586
and she sort of wishes she hadn't said it sometimes, I think, because she's I was telling her about the books that I'd read 
when I was in high school, which happened to be a series of hardcover juvenile science fiction books published by the

00:59.819 --> 01:15.193
Winston Company, and how I'd been in love with those things, had read them several times and had fondled them a lot and so 
on. And she says, oh, there are used book dealers. They could probably find copies of those and you could buy them. And I

01:24.441 --> 01:25.962
hadn't even considered that. In the past, I'd only bought what I'd found at newsstands. And so when the time came and I 
started sending these lists to all the dealers, well, they had all these other fantastic books also. And it sort of

01:37.520 --> 01:39.483
mushroomed from there. Okay, good. Could you tell me what kinds of things you concentrate on collecting? Well, I once 
gave a talk on this subject and I titled it The Complete Science Fiction Collector, Confessions of a Pack Rat. In other

01:57.229 --> 01:58.311
words, I'm... Very, very versatile and Catholic in my taste. I don't like all kinds of things as much equally, but I 
collect anything that's published in the science fiction and fantasy vein, I get my hands on, and then I can afford.

02:16.086 --> 02:20.552
Which means I've got copies of almost every book that's been published. Okay, now I'm not sure I still understand that. 
I'm not sure if there's a term for this, but I'm talking about categories like paperbacks, pulps, hardbacks, things of

02:24.051 --> 02:29.938
that sort. I started out with paperbacks and the Digest magazines. I've gone back in terms of picking up the old pulp 
magazines to the point where now I have almost all of them that were ever published, starting back with Weird Tales in

02:36.086 --> 02:49.003
1923 and Amazing Stories in 1926. I'm very proud of my complete collection of weird tales, since I understand there's 
only about 30 copies or so in existence, and just about as good on astounding science fiction, for example. Recently, I

03:01.784 --> 03:08.211
have been branching out into hardbacks also, but I'm a long, long ways from completing that. What about just plain old 
paperbacks? Well, I have about 14,000, 15,000. Is that enough for you? Yeah, do you try to pick up all of those or do you

03:17.114 --> 03:21.099
just take certain kinds? There's always a problem in making the, where do you draw the line? But I basically get 
everything that's clearly science fiction, everything that's clearly fantasy. I kind of draw the line someplace in

03:32.913 --> 03:38.799
the horror vein to one side and maybe fairy tales on the other side. And sometimes I'll draw the line at, you know, an Adam 
Baum story that's set in the near future or something like that. But basically, I get every paper bag in science fiction

03:47.573 --> 03:54.522
and fantasy. There's multiple editions, I might say. Every time a new cover comes out, why, I'll buy the new edition. 
Okay. Now, this question is really going to show my ignorance, but how do you accumulate your books? Do you go about it by

04:06.176 --> 04:11.122
cold, methodical planning and then go right to the publisher, or do you just search around bookstores? How do you go 
about that? No, I buy most of mine these days... I'll buy the ones I like better, new, so that I have a mint copy on

04:15.130 --> 04:22.797
paperbacks especially. But an awful lot of them, I buy them used. They're fairly recent, just in the local bookstores. 
Lubbock is blessed with about seven or eight, so I make the rounds on a regular basis and just pick up whatever I happen to

04:29.122 --> 04:35.608
come across. Sooner or later, I find most everything in the recent things. And on older things, I go through mail-order 
dealers. Okay, then. I assume, and I know through Bill, that there are publications and so forth. I mean, how do you know

04:51.704 --> 04:55.208
how much is coming out? Do you have some kind of checklist? The best source by far is the news magazine of science fiction 
called Locus. And Science Fiction Chronicle also has these sort of things. They attempt to list every book that comes

05:06.520 --> 05:10.044
out in the field. In fact, they're even wider in their categories. than I am, and they include academic-type books and 
things like this, too. And every month, they will list everything that's come out by every publisher. Most of the

05:20.912 --> 05:31.485
publishers send them copies, and the ones that don't, they still will write down there that they know this book exists, 
but they haven't seen a copy. They also give many reviews on many of them. And I assume for the... I call it Pulse. I'm not

05:39.054 --> 05:39.995
sure what the term is. I assume for those, you just have subscriptions? There are no pulp magazines that have been 
published since 1955 or so. They sort of went the way of the dinosaurs. But their successors are the Digest-sized

05:51.404 --> 06:05.465
magazines, as well as such large, oversized ones as Omni

05:51.404 --> 06:05.465
and Twilight Zone currently. And so I buy those on the newsstands every month. Okay, do you ever run across any valuable 
finds or little nuggets just by accident just browsing around? Not as many as I would like. Occasionally I do. I pick up

06:20.833 --> 06:30.427
quite a few moderately rare things, say, for example, for half a cover price at a used bookstore. But that's getting to be 
more and more rare as the collectors have got all the valuable things grabbed up. Most of them I have to pay more or less

06:39.715 --> 06:40.696
market value. Actually, one other source I didn't mention for many of my books, because I buy so many, I'll actually buy a 
person's entire collection just to get the books that I especially want, if there's some older, rarer ones among them. I

06:54.671 --> 06:57.133
assume then you have a complete set of the Ace Doubles? Actually, I'm still missing one that's been rather elusive, but 
other than that, I have all the Ace Doubles, yeah. Is that D13? I have a D13. Yes, I do. I was very lucky to get that before the

07:07.113 --> 07:11.378
prices started escalating as much as they have. And I got it from one of the major dealers, and I paid what now, three or 
four years later, would seem to be a real steal. Okay, what about traveling? Do you ever travel just to make collecting

07:23.029 --> 07:25.592
trips? No, I combine collecting trips with whenever I happen to be traveling. I remember one time, not too long ago, we 
visited relatives in Madison, Wisconsin, and I had to mail all the books back because there wasn't room in the rabbit for

07:30.965 --> 07:41.945
the family in the books. And my wife said, no way are we going to sit in here with several boxes of books. But I don't make 
deliberate trips just to buy things. Okay, do you... Are you a reader and a fan of science fiction first and then a

07:56.598 --> 08:02.044
collector, or are you in the field principally for collecting? Yeah, people keep asking me that. How much of this stuff 
do you read? Well, the answer is as much as I have time for, which in my rather busy schedule is between 50 and 70 books a

08:06.188 --> 08:14.397
year, I estimate. And I'll probably add 1,000 to the collection in a year, so I certainly don't read a very big 
percentage. But I pick and choose among what I've got. Since I have less hardbacks and since they cost more in general, I

08:24.340 --> 08:32.656
feel some sort of a semi-obligation to try to read something if I bought it in hardback.

08:35.280 --> 08:40.069
Okay, I'm sure you're asked this question from people who know that you're a collector. Just from a psychological point 
of view, why do you collect? Because it's there? That's actually, I suppose, a difficult question for anyone to answer.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.986
First of all, you have to love books or whatever you're collecting. I mean, this is the collector's mania. There's lots 
of people that collect anything from matchbooks to old Avon bottles, for heaven's sakes. And I collect what I enjoy from

09:06.719 --> 09:11.504
other standpoints. I enjoy the artwork on them. I enjoy reading the things. I like to read at least the representative's 
book by any author that's important in the field and so on. And I just love books. I love to handle them. I love to sort them,

09:25.735 --> 09:29.179
catalog them, put them away, just look at them. And that's what I do with a fair portion of my spare time, I

09:29.640 --> 09:37.769
guess. There's one more aspect to this. If you really get the collecting bug, and that is... the completest attitude. 
That is, for example, you decide you want to collect something. I don't care what it is, but let's say it's the

09:48.853 --> 09:52.098
ace-doubles. You use that as an example. A lot of people have gone after them, for example, so the prices are growing up. 
But once you decide you want to get the ace-doubles, you don't care which ones are good ones and which ones are bad ones in

09:58.568 --> 10:05.059
terms of the story. All you're concerned about is getting a copy of every one. And that same thing goes especially for 
people that collect the magazines, because there it's pretty obvious whether you've got them all because they're all

10:09.843 --> 10:18.272
nicely laid out by months.

10:21.115 --> 10:23.898
Okay, I think you sort of halfway answered this one a minute ago. If you think, if you would just repeat yourself, go ahead 
and tell me, and I won't ask this, but I asked you, why do you collect? Why science fiction books? Why not something else,

10:32.707 --> 10:36.090
like mysteries or westerns or seashells or something? Because I love science fiction. Something we haven't gotten 
into the conversation yet is here at Texas Tech, I also am involved in helping the team teach the course in science

10:38.075 --> 10:51.690
fiction. We have a special course through our honors program, and there are three or four of us every semester. Team 
teach this thing to a small group, and we try to teach them principles about writing also, so it's a creative writing

10:58.717 --> 11:07.947
course, very much a discussion course and so on. I just love science fiction. I don't mind reading an occasional 
mystery, let's say. I haven't read a Western in 20 years, but I've read lots of science fiction. Since that's what I like

11:18.508 --> 11:21.091
to read, that's what I like to collect. Also, I might say that many of the older science fiction books are more valuable to 
collectors in general than many of those in other fields of, say, comparable age and publisher. Okay, you also sort of

11:37.188 --> 11:49.339
answered this one a minute ago, too, but let me ask you, let's say with the books that you've collected sometimes, let's 
say your collection of Weird Tales or something, what do you do with those books? Do you take them out and read them or

11:49.359 --> 11:51.861
handle them or what? I handle them to the extent of cataloging them. I have a very extensive catalog system, as you might 
guess. I'll look at them occasionally. On the Weird Tales, especially in a few things like this, I have people that... I

12:06.331 --> 12:08.754
correspond with other collectors and so on. And some of them who can't afford to spend several hundred dollars for some 
of the early issues, let's say, and might want to read some story that's never been reproduced or something like that,

12:09.235 --> 12:24.074
I'll actually make a photocopy of it for them for my expenses and time. That's one thing I do with some of them. Okay, and 
you must be fairly knowledgeable about other collectors and the sources and so forth. Are there people who collect the

12:37.056 --> 12:46.792
science fiction books simply because it's... Oh, I don't know, because it's just something to collect. You know, maybe 
you're not fans who don't care anything about science fiction. Maybe as an investment, let's say. Yeah. My advice to

12:55.125 --> 12:58.090
somebody who wants to do that is... You've got to know a heck of a lot about this field before you're likely to be very 
successful at it, going about it from that standpoint. Because just because something is old doesn't necessarily mean

13:05.754 --> 13:12.963
that it's especially valuable. And what would be really difficult from the investor's standpoint, from somebody who 
knew very little about the field, is to know which books to pick up now because 10 years from now they're going to be worth a

13:13.284 --> 13:25.480
lot. In fact, that's kind of hard for me to guess. And I sure in heck know more about it than a lot of people do. Well, you're 
not in it for the investment, are you? No, I'm not. But, you know, I'm thinking about comic book collectors especially.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.363
There's a heck of a lot of people in that field. While many of the most fanatical ones clearly love comic books, there are 
people that see this fantastic way that the prices go up on those things and want to buy them just as an investment. In

13:58.347 --> 14:09.823
fact, the paperback books are kind of getting in that category to an extent because they are publishing price guides for 
them now, and they hadn't done that until very recently. In your particular line of collecting, what is considered the

14:09.903 --> 14:13.708
ultimate? The ultimate. I'd say the rarest item I've got is my volume one, number one, Weird Tales.

14:24.943 --> 14:26.886
But there are... Well, it depends on what you're talking about. For example, here's an example a lot of people would know 
about. Frank Herbert's Dune, hardcover, the first edition, is worth a great, great deal of money, simply because Dune

14:34.698 --> 14:51.877
wasn't that well known when it first came out, didn't attract that much attention until slowly over several years, and 
that first hardcover edition is extremely hard to find. So that in good condition, I understand that... A first

14:57.190 --> 14:59.132
edition's worth a thousand bucks. Well, I don't have a copy of it. I wouldn't mind having a copy at all, although I 
wouldn't pay that money for it. But I know somebody who found one in the garage sale in Lubbock and bugs the heck out of me.

15:10.805 --> 15:14.509
It wasn't me.

15:16.812 --> 15:19.575
How much can a really valuable single paperback cost? Well, I can tell you the highest price I've heard anybody charge 
for anything is And that was, and I don't know that they got it. This was the asking prize. It was $175 for Cat in a Canary

15:33.701 --> 15:38.347
House by Kurt Vonnegut. And that book, which is his only collection of short stories and which are all unabashedly 
science fiction, he vows he'll never allow reprinted as long as he lives. And there aren't all that many copies

15:48.879 --> 15:53.104
available, so the price of that thing has been really escalating. I got my copy for $3, I don't mind telling you. What's 
the most you paid for a paperback? I think about 20, and I don't do that for very many, I assure you. By the way, this isn't a

16:05.417 --> 16:13.905
formal question, but do you happen to have a paperback copy of the Hillman edition of The Dying Earth, the first 
paperback? No, as a matter of fact, that's another one that I could have mentioned that's in that pretty good category.

16:22.293 --> 16:26.597
Jack Vance, in general, is a very collectible person, and my I've got everything that's, say, relatively accessible, 
but I don't have something like that. I do have its first hardback, by the way, Vandals of the Void. There are a lot of

16:35.797 --> 16:37.399
people who wouldn't mind having that. Yeah, okay. One thing that I wonder about with paperback and digest collectors 
like yourself, it seems to me that paperbacks don't last an awfully long time. How do you store and preserve them for the

16:51.058 --> 16:53.041
future? That's a very good question. Well, first of all, they're going to deteriorate no matter what you do. You can slow 
it down. Here in Lubbock, I've got, my stuff is down a basement, and the temperature stays fairly constant, and the

17:01.659 --> 17:15.895
humidity is relatively low, and it's not too far from ideal book storage conditions just automatically. The rare 
things, especially, I do put in plastic bags, and... I also have access to, my wife is a librarian up at Texas Tech, and so I

17:22.720 --> 17:30.249
have access to her. She's actually the one who does the book repairs, among other things, and all the prepping of books, 
that sort of thing. So I have access to her facilities for repairing things. If I have a copy, let's say the glue is coming

17:40.162 --> 17:50.635
out, I can re-glue it with good grade library glue, and I've gotten pretty good at making repairs that are fairly 
unnoticeable. And I can make a pretty beat-up-looking copy look halfway decent. That's a lot better to have one that you

17:56.938 --> 17:59.402
don't have to do that. If I had a really rare one, I would simply put it in the bag and not touch it anymore and hope it won't 
crumble. I suppose for something you're buying that's an older copy, no matter what it is, the value is mostly dependent

18:06.394 --> 18:12.864
on the condition it's in? Condition is extremely important, yes. You can have a rare book that's in perfect condition 
and expect to pay anywhere from two to ten times as much as a poorer copy. Because many of the real serious collectors are

18:26.337 --> 18:30.764
conditioned freaks. They won't accept one unless it's just in pretty darn nice shape. And something that's been read 
and passed around and survived through several... Trips to the used bookstore certainly isn't in that condition. You

18:44.890 --> 18:47.234
pretty much have to get one that was a one-owner book.

18:49.938 --> 18:57.551
Okay, do you have any particular goals at this time, rather than just keep adding on the new books that are coming out? Is 
there any particular thing you're aiming at? Not really, which is one reason, too, why the fact that I don't have Vans is

19:00.116 --> 19:06.927
Dying Earth, just to take as an example. Sure, I would like to get a copy, and hopefully I'll run across, be in the right 
place at the right time on one someday. But I'm not pursuing it fanatically. If I really said I've got to have that book no

19:15.660 --> 19:25.731
matter what, and I'm willing to pay the price and write to every dealer in the country that I can find the name for, 
somebody would come up with a copy, sure. But since I'm so widespread, anything I don't get at any particular time, I

19:26.191 --> 19:32.839
assume, well, there's a fair chance I'll get it later. And certainly I have the dying earth in umpteen other editions. 
take that as an example. And I've read it, you know, so it would be nice to have that first edition. There's an awful lot of

19:43.889 --> 19:49.755
things that I don't have, even then, and I'll never have everything, so what the heck. Is there any particular item that 
you especially covet? I

19:56.041 --> 20:03.108
don't really know. There's... I could make a short list of a dozen that would be highest priority in terms of this is what 
I'd pay the most money for. Some of Philip Jose Farmer's rarest books, the advanced ones, these guys are both highly

20:11.803 --> 20:27.326
collectible anyway, and there'd be a few others. Would you sell your collection or any portion of it for a high enough 
price? Probably not now. I do know somebody who retired and took a round-the-world trip on selling his.

20:43.360 --> 20:49.168
Where would the greatest collections of science fiction material of your type in existence be? Oh, that's easy. 
Forrest J. Ackerman was sort of a number one fan. He's a pretty old man now. But he has been active in the field for... I

21:03.142 --> 21:24.103
don't know, well over 50 years, and he has repeatedly bought everything, including all kinds of knick-knacks and toys 
and first edition paintings and just literally over 100,000 pieces, I understand, which is all in a... He's donated it

21:03.142 --> 21:24.103
to... Gee, I forgot one. One of the California cities, San Francisco, I think. But anyway... Anyway, it is... reputed to 
be by far the most fantastic collection that's ever been put together. By the way, there are some libraries now,

21:38.889 --> 21:46.179
academic-type libraries and others, who have extremely good collections of science fiction. Within Texas, for 
example, A&M has a special collection that I don't think has as many pieces, but probably has more value than my

21:46.600 --> 21:58.077
collection. I know they have a complete set of weird tales, for example. Yeah, we managed to talk to Forrest Ackerman, 
interviewed him in person at the Denvention, too, a couple years ago. So I think I knew the answer to that before I asked

22:10.182 --> 22:12.784
you. Right, that's all right. Not everybody listening to you well. Yeah. Is there any kind of, I don't know, 
association, group, publications, et cetera, that go along with the collecting business? Not that I know of

22:27.116 --> 22:29.739
specifically for science fiction. There have been several... little amateur publications with titles like 
Paperback Quarterly, for example, that have to do with collecting paperbacks exclusively. Mostly what you have is,

22:40.600 --> 22:46.425
well, there are various kinds of guides, of course, and indexes. But other than that, you just get catalogs from dealers 
and start looking around. Would you have any advice for a beginner, somebody who loved science fiction but had not

22:54.273 --> 23:00.038
collected anything, who wanted to start? Okay. Probably what most people will do when they start is they will pick a 
favorite author or authors and try to get all the books by that person. Somebody with a limited budget just starting

23:09.815 --> 23:25.155
think, you know, that's a pretty good first step to say, for example, get every book, a copy of some edition of every book 
that Robert A. Heinlein has written or Andre Norton or you name it, whoever the person happens to like. And, uh, Once they

23:26.832 --> 23:46.259
do that, and if they start getting the collecting bug, then pretty soon they'll want to trade in those later printings 
for first editions, and then if they've really gotten into it, they'll want to trade in those beat-up first editions for

23:26.832 --> 23:46.259
better copies for the first editions when they do it, and they'll probably start expanding into other authors. Or some 
people will do it in terms of, say, for example, a specific publisher trying to get everything. Or in the case of the

23:52.147 --> 23:54.510
magazines, as I say, that's They might start with, let's say, Astounding Analog or Magazine of Fantasy and Science 
Fiction or something like that or Amazing Stories, whatever, and maybe branch out as much as their time, money, and

23:54.693 --> 24:12.460
inclination allow them to. If you decided, I understand from Bill that you'd also sell a little bit, if you decided to do 
that as a living, is it possible to make a living off of it? Not without one. A heck of a lot of time and effort. Yeah, I

24:24.294 --> 24:37.550
basically, what I'm doing is selling off duplicates that I wind up with, either from buying people's collections or 
from, if I find a really rare book, even if I have it, I'll pick it up if it's cheap. And also, you know, when I buy a full

24:38.411 --> 24:43.958
collection, there'll be lots of duplicates in there. Or I just buy something just to upgrade my copy. Because I did, 
there was many years there when I wasn't fussy about condition. I'm getting more and more so myself. And so I'm still

24:53.948 --> 24:59.513
weeding out beat-up copies and putting better copies in places. But it's a part-time, on-the-side type thing I do send 
out. I have a small list of people that are on a mailing list that get an occasional catalog I put out. Or some people send me

25:11.825 --> 25:13.626
want lists. And if I have duplicates, I'll tell them, hey, I got this. And I'll be able to sell it cheaper than other 
people. Okay, I just have a couple more, John. Let's see, how should I put this one? Like, what's going to happen in the

25:28.462 --> 25:29.763
future? You know, I assume you're going to be collecting for most of the rest of your life and so forth. What do you think is 
going to happen to your collection? Do you have any plans? Well, I'll tell you one thing. I'd hate to think about moving.

25:40.974 --> 25:46.560
But other than that, my wife has talked about that. Briefly, a little bit, once in a while. I would expect, you know, if 
something unexpected happens, sometime after retirement I'll probably be interested in selling off at least most of

25:49.369 --> 25:58.258
it. But that's a long ways down the road. She said donate it to some library. Well, if she's left with the decision, she 
does what she wants. But I would want to recoup some of the things, some of what we got into it. Okay, I think you answered

26:13.523 --> 26:18.949
this one a little earlier, partially, but let me, as I wind down, just do one more try at it. What part of your collection 
are you, say, the most proud of? My pulp magazines, I think, is sort of my own favorite among all the things. You know,

26:29.781 --> 26:37.489
people come into the house, visitors that know nothing about science fiction, and I always trot them downstairs and 
show them the collection. Kind of funny to watch somebody, you hand them one of those old pulp magazines, give them one

26:37.874 --> 26:49.606
that isn't crumbling too badly, and then they start looking at all the old ads from the 30s or whatever. It's kind of a 
history lesson just to go through the things if they don't know the stories or care about that. That's especially why

26:55.992 --> 26:58.795
they find the ads more fascinating than anything. But I started out in terms of serious collecting with the magazines 
and the pulp especially. those early ones especially are there just aren't very many copies around and so that's kind of

27:08.553 --> 27:20.849
my favorite part of the collection.

27:20.869 --> 27:25.915
What kind of reactions do you get from people when they first get to know you and find out that you collect like this? Do 
they think you're pretty weird? Most of them are at least polite. Actually It's fairly well known around here because a

27:32.988 --> 27:42.398
couple of years ago, the wire services got a hold of it, and I was interviewed, and there were write-ups and papers all 
over the state. And I just learned the other day there was actually one in Lincoln, Nebraska, and I don't know where else,

27:42.418 --> 27:51.248
as well as I appeared on local television and a few other things. So I don't make any big secret about it, at least. So some 
people know of my reputation. Oh, you mean you're the guy with all those books? Is there any way for you to tell how you, I

28:02.131 --> 28:13.725
don't know, I'm sure how to put this, how you rank or how your collection stacks up against some of the other collectors 
around the country? Not really. I have corresponded with a fair amount of collectors, and I know if I think about it, I

28:16.829 --> 28:29.665
could probably put together a dozen names or so of ones who probably have at least comparable size collections. I... 
except possibly for some in some libraries. I doubt there are very many that are bigger. I have no real way to know that,

28:37.469 --> 28:42.657
because I don't go to conventions around the country and things like that. So I need some of these people by letter, but I 
don't know. At least not very many of them do that one thing I do of collecting multiple editions of the same book. Yeah.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.585
This is another one that's sort of off the record, but I'm a Lord of the Rings bug, you know, Tolkien fan. And I recently 
found a set of the Ace Lord of the Rings books in paperback. Are they worth much? Depending on condition, I think that the

29:13.017 --> 29:21.810
market price for a nice copy is probably in the range of ten bucks. Ten bucks each? Yeah, I'm not sure. I haven't really 
seen anybody list one very recently. It could be more. That's what I paid, $10 each, and they were in good condition.

29:36.136 --> 29:36.337
What? That was a pretty good estimate on your part. Okay.

29:43.406 --> 29:49.995
Well, listen, John, like I said, I don't know a great deal about collecting, so... You've been asking good questions. 
Well, I was wondering, is there any area or anything you'd like to say or stuff that I'm missing? I think we've pretty much

29:55.126 --> 29:59.773
covered the waterfront, as far as I can tell. Yeah, I would say so. We do have some things in common. I'm a teacher here at 
Odessa College. I teach English. Oh, uh-huh. But David and I do team teach a science fiction class. Oh, yeah. Right,

30:10.248 --> 30:11.290
that's right. So maybe sometime in the future I might get back to you. We could just do a show or two on just teaching 
science fiction, something like that. Oh, okay. Our own approach is probably semi-genic. At least it isn't like any of

30:23.813 --> 30:26.996
them that I've seen syllabuses on. Syllabi, whatever it is. Yeah.

30:33.102 --> 30:34.784
Well, John, that's about all I can think of. We obviously will send you the tapes when the shows are edited. Oh, okay, 
great. David, is there anything you want to ask me? I think I covered pretty much. Collecting a series or something like

30:42.652 --> 30:44.975
that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, John. Yeah. Do you know, this is off the record, too. You know anybody who's got a copy of 
Zelazny's Guns of Avalon, first edition hardcover? No, I don't. Not in hardcover. Yeah. I understand that's pretty

31:00.253 --> 31:02.055
hard to get a hold of. It's not near as hard as Nine Princes. Oh, okay. I got the wrong one then. Oh, I see. I don't have 
anything except the book club edition. Okay. I'm just starting into hardbacks, really, and I don't have all that much

31:13.007 --> 31:17.952
that's rare. And I certainly don't have duplicate copies. Okay, well, listen, John, we appreciate your time. Maybe 
some one of these days I'll get to meet you if we come to some local convention up there or something. Right, well,

31:29.180 --> 31:32.143
hopefully we'll have a convention here again next year. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much then, John. We'll get these 
tapes to you as soon as they're done. Okay, great. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
