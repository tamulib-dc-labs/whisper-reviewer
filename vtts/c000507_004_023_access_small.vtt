Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:27.940 --> 00:33.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.560
And here are your hosts.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.320
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.440
Frederick Paul knows science fiction as few other people do.

00:48.120 --> 00:52.140
He's been an editor of science fiction books and magazines, an agent who's handled the

00:52.140 --> 00:56.080
biggest names in the field, and an author who's won numerous Hugo and Nebula awards.

00:56.860 --> 01:00.220
With such a background, Paul is uniquely qualified to comment on science fiction.

01:00.740 --> 01:04.180
One of the things that impresses him the most is the way science fiction has changed and

01:04.180 --> 01:06.740
diversified since he began writing in the 1930s.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.740
Science fiction today is not only very different from what it was in the 30s, it's very different

01:11.740 --> 01:13.800
from other kinds of science fiction today.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.440
One of the things that attracts me to science fiction is that there are so many different

01:17.440 --> 01:18.220
kinds of it.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.660
There are books like the one we mentioned before, Dahlgren, which are not a bit like the ones

01:22.660 --> 01:28.440
by Doc Smith, Skylark stories, Lenten stories, which are not a bit like the ones by Ursula

01:28.440 --> 01:33.600
Gwyn, which are not a bit like the one by Larry Niven, for example.

01:34.460 --> 01:40.180
And I think that science fiction is characterized by variety.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.180
There are very few general statements you can make about science fiction.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.640
It isn't fiction about science, it isn't fiction about the future, it isn't fiction

01:48.640 --> 01:49.560
about space travel.

01:50.500 --> 01:57.120
It's fiction which has to do more than anything else with change.

01:58.340 --> 02:04.580
Somebody asked Arthur Clarke once why he wrote science fiction and he said something like

02:04.580 --> 02:07.900
because it's the only literature that concerns itself with reality.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.180
Paul believes science fiction's emphasis on change can be beneficial.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.420
I think anybody who reads science fiction is very likely to be overcome by a future

02:17.420 --> 02:17.840
shock.

02:19.360 --> 02:26.820
Well, when the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, there were only about 10,000 people in the

02:26.820 --> 02:28.120
world who understood what had happened.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.260
About 500 nuclear physicists and the rest were all science fiction fans.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.660
And I think the same has been true about the space program and about many of the social

02:36.660 --> 02:39.100
developments in the last 20 or 30 years.

02:39.800 --> 02:47.240
And I think that if you read enough science fiction, you begin to get a spectrum of the

02:47.240 --> 02:50.300
possible futures that lie ahead for all of us.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.680
I think it's quite useful in the sense that it lets you make decisions now about which

02:55.680 --> 03:00.660
ones of them you would like to avoid or which ones you would like to avert and helps you

03:00.660 --> 03:08.200
find ways of taking actions now that will encourage the good ones and discourage the bad ones.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.280
But it's not just that.

03:10.280 --> 03:18.760
I think science fiction also has a good deal of entertainment of what is to me an extremely

03:19.160 --> 03:20.380
pleasurable kind to offer.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.740
Since the days of the Pult Magazine's in the 1920s and 1930s, science fiction has been a

03:25.740 --> 03:27.000
separate category of literature.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.020
Some readers have scorned it as shallower second class.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.460
Paul believes that the book publishers are responsible for keeping science fiction separate.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.200
He also disagrees with the notion that science fiction is in any way inferior.

03:38.820 --> 03:43.360
The publishing industry is responsible for that and in some ways it's a bad thing.

03:43.740 --> 03:49.260
A lot of people in this world like to read books but are prejudiced against anything that has to

03:49.260 --> 03:51.020
word science fiction on it.

03:51.400 --> 03:58.440
I think it's, I've forgotten the person who wrote the poem, his little poem about it which says

03:58.440 --> 04:03.440
something like, if it's science fiction I don't like it and if I like it it can't possibly be

04:03.440 --> 04:07.600
science fiction because there are a great many science fiction novels that everybody loves.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.260
They just don't admit that science fiction has brave new world in 1984.

04:12.580 --> 04:17.060
Finally, Paul believes that science fiction is uniquely qualified to treat any possible

04:17.060 --> 04:17.700
subject matter.

04:18.820 --> 04:24.780
I think science fiction has special qualifications to act as a vehicle for discussing anything

04:24.780 --> 04:26.000
that affects the human being.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.780
It's a way of looking at the human race from outside objectively.

04:30.220 --> 04:35.600
It's a way of, it's sort of a game playing mechanism for seeing what would happen to

04:35.600 --> 04:39.960
two human beings under conditions that haven't occurred yet but are very possible.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.520
And I think that that's probably one of the strongest factors accounting for the continual

04:46.520 --> 04:50.680
growth and interest in science fiction that seems to have been going on as long as I've been alive.

04:52.220 --> 04:52.740
Music

04:57.740 --> 05:02.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

And here are your hosts.

06:17.240 --> 06:17.940
Music

06:19.420 --> 06:20.840
This is Daryl Lane.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.400
Frederick Poll has been a part of science fiction for almost 50 years.

06:25.060 --> 06:29.900
He knows the field as few others do since he's been a fan, an author, an agent, and an editor.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.320
He recalls what got him interested in science fiction back in the 1930s.

06:35.040 --> 06:40.000
Well, I think it was basically the adventure, the kind of science fiction that was being published

06:40.000 --> 06:43.080
around 1930 when I first got in touch with it.

06:43.080 --> 06:52.600
My first discovery that it existed was mostly space opera and gimmick stories and stories about exciting,

06:53.820 --> 06:55.700
adventurous exploits all over the galaxy.

06:56.580 --> 07:03.400
And that was in the middle of the Great Depression, and science fiction looked an awful lot better to me than the real world that I could see.

07:04.360 --> 07:08.680
Poll probably fulfilled a fantasy of his own when he became a science fiction editor when he was 19.

07:09.720 --> 07:14.860
I was lucky enough to fall into a job as a professional magazine editor when I was 19.

07:15.120 --> 07:20.560
I had asked an editor I knew because I'd been trying to sell him stories about success.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.900
If he needed an assistant, and he was kind enough not to laugh out loud.

07:26.720 --> 07:31.160
I didn't know at the time that not very many science fiction magazine editors could afford assistance.

07:31.660 --> 07:36.100
But he mentioned to me another publishing company that was expanding and suggested I get a touch with them.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.780
So I did. It was Popular Publications, one of the biggest poll passes of the time.

07:41.560 --> 07:47.420
And they were expanding and they gave me a job at $10 a week to edit two professional science fiction magazines.

07:48.560 --> 07:52.420
$10 wasn't so bad. They hired other editors for nothing at the same time.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.580
Many of today's well-known writers published some of their early work with poll.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.680
Well, I published a lot of Isogasm out of stuff because we were close friends.

08:01.680 --> 08:09.300
A few of Robert A. Heinlein's stories that his primary market, John Campbell, for one reason or other, didn't want to print.

08:10.180 --> 08:15.340
And Henry Kutner and A. E. Van Dout and Cleve Cartmille and Elsprague De Camp.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.100
And most of the people who were writing at that time wound up in my magazine.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.880
Not always with their best stories. In fact, very often with their worst stories.

08:26.300 --> 08:30.100
Because I wasn't paying very much. I had a budget of about half a cent a word.

08:30.100 --> 08:35.540
In the 60s, Poll edited Galaxy, one of the principal science fiction magazines of its era.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.740
Much of the best science fiction of that period went through Poll.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.280
His comments on how an editor deals with his authors are revealing.

08:43.380 --> 08:55.320
Writers are very diverse human beings. Some of them respond to long letters of criticism and suggestions and patting on the back or beating over the head.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.900
And some of them do not want any outside influence at all.

09:00.580 --> 09:09.300
One of my favorite writers told me early in our relationship that he was willing to have me buy some stories and reject others.

09:09.620 --> 09:14.980
He didn't want to hear why. I sent it back, just sent it back and say, send it back and say no.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.900
And not tell him what I didn't like about it because I'd upset him.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.420
Other writers wanted to know in great detail, not only what I didn't like, but what I did like.

09:24.200 --> 09:30.040
And also there are some writers who are very responsive to money and some to whom money means nothing at all.

09:30.280 --> 09:35.440
Not that they are immune to it, but they don't want to think in those terms.

09:36.380 --> 09:42.020
And there are some writers who respond to a lot of personal attention and some who really want to be left alone.

09:42.600 --> 09:49.200
And I had to find out something about each writer to find out the best way to deal with them.

09:49.200 --> 09:54.860
One person Paul discovered and encouraged is one of Science Fiction's bestselling authors today, Larry Niven.

09:55.940 --> 10:01.200
I published his first story, which is a very short one, for which he got a very short paycheck.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.560
And his next one was a little longer and he got a little more.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.220
And the next one was quite a lot longer and he got quite a lot more.

10:07.660 --> 10:15.360
And Larry said that if it hadn't been for those three events in that order, he could not have gone on being a writer.

10:15.360 --> 10:22.860
So I take some pride in the fact that I was instrumental in making it possible for him to devote his time to writing.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.820
For many reasons, we can be grateful Frederick Paul was a Science Fiction editor.

10:33.360 --> 10:39.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:39.660 --> 10:42.540
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.260
So stay with us.

11:42.700 --> 11:47.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.280
And here are your hosts.

11:57.980 --> 12:03.600
This is Daryl Lane, one of the best known of all Science Fiction novels is the collaboration between two authors,

12:03.980 --> 12:05.340
Frederick Paul and Cyril Cornbluth.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.300
The novel is a Space Merchants.

12:07.920 --> 12:13.340
Published in 1951, the book is a clever social satire, a form of writing not often found in Science Fiction.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.520
Huge advertising agencies run the United States.

12:17.620 --> 12:21.660
It's a classic example of extrapolation, one of the major techniques of Science Fiction.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.520
Frederick Paul had the original idea for the book.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.280
He recalls where it came from.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.920
And one of its great defects was that I didn't know anything about advertising.

12:55.920 --> 13:01.080
So I went to the New York Sunday Times and looked in the classified section,

13:01.320 --> 13:05.440
found a couple of people advertising jobs in advertising,

13:06.280 --> 13:11.000
and applied and got one of them and spent about three years as an advertising copywriter.

13:11.500 --> 13:19.820
During that time, I looked over at this old novel again and realized that it had many more faults and ignorance.

13:20.980 --> 13:27.300
And I burned it and I had only basic information about advertising and no novel to put it in.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.040
So I thought of writing a Science Fiction novel and it turned out to be the Space Merchants.

13:32.300 --> 13:36.180
Before the war, Paul had belonged to a Science Fiction group in New York called the Futurians.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.580
One member of that group was Cyril Cornbluth.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.620
He and Paul had collaborated before on Science Fiction stories.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.380
Paul describes their method.

13:44.400 --> 13:51.320
Mostly what Cyril and I did was to, typically we wrote seven novels and a number of short stories together.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.740
Generally speaking, what we did after the war, after the Space Merchants,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.580
and we began writing novels more often than short stories.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.880
Cyril would come out to my house in Red Bank, New Jersey,

14:02.880 --> 14:08.620
where we kept the room for him with his own typewriter and we'd sit around and talk for a while

14:08.620 --> 14:16.060
and discuss general areas we were interested in writing about, maybe some characters.

14:17.320 --> 14:21.900
And then we'd flip the coin and the loser would go up to the third floor and write the first four pages.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.240
And he'd come down and say, you're on, the other person would go up and write the next four pages.

14:27.380 --> 14:33.140
And if you do that about 25 or 30 times, you have the rough draft of a complete novel.

14:33.840 --> 14:40.000
Everything got radically rewritten after that because the rough draft was pretty rough, but structurally it was all there.

14:40.820 --> 14:43.080
Cornbluth helped Paul finish the Space Merchants.

14:43.740 --> 14:47.300
Cyril Cornbluth was a close friend of mine.

14:47.440 --> 14:52.140
We'd collaborated before the war, before we both went into service.

14:52.860 --> 15:00.740
And after I'd written about a third of it, because a magazine editor wanted it in a hurry,

15:00.740 --> 15:07.040
I asked Cyril if he wanted to help me with it and he and I collaborated on it.

15:07.040 --> 15:12.420
At the end of the Space Merchants, the protagonist, Mitch Courtney, leaves an earth which is totally disgusting.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.900
There is no individual freedom, food and energy are strictly rationed.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.160
Mitch heads for Venus with the idea of starting fresh, but the ending is ambiguous.

15:21.860 --> 15:22.780
Is it hopeful or not?

15:23.740 --> 15:29.460
I left it ambiguous partly because I wasn't feeling very positive at the time.

15:29.460 --> 15:37.540
The novel was written in 1952 in their abouts, which was a pretty grimy period in the history of this country.

15:37.900 --> 15:44.440
It was the McCarthy years and the Cold War years and things did not look too...

15:44.440 --> 15:47.460
They didn't look even as good as they do now, as a matter of fact.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.740
So I wasn't feeling optimistic.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.740
I didn't mean to foreclose the possibility of a happy ending.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.780
Actually, the novel had two endings. There was a different ending in the magazine version.

15:58.860 --> 16:04.320
More upbeat, but less organically related to the rest of the novel.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.700
It was put in at the insistence of the magazine editor.

16:13.860 --> 16:19.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:19.200 --> 16:22.360
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:08.320 --> 17:12.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:29.880 --> 17:35.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.380
And here are your hosts.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.500
This is David Carson.

17:45.740 --> 17:46.400
And Daryl In.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.100
In 1978, Frederick Poe won a rare double honor in science fiction.

17:50.760 --> 17:55.620
It was in that year his book Gateway when both the Hugo and Nebula Awards is the best science fiction novel of the year.

17:56.080 --> 18:00.720
The Nebula is voted on by other science fiction writers, so Poe's peers had high praise for the book.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.260
And the Hugo results from the votes of science fiction fans and readers, so they also thought Poe's novel to be exceptional.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.360
Both groups have good reason to think Gateway was something special.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.520
It's an exciting narrative set against the background of a superior alien civilization.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.000
But the twist in Gateway is that the aliens, called the Heechee, have vanished.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.940
Humans have discovered some of their abandoned technology, though.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.520
And that technology is impressive, but dangerous.

18:23.080 --> 18:30.560
Humans find portals or gates in the fabric of space and special Heechee ships nearby which can travel through those gates to various places around the universe.

18:31.140 --> 18:37.680
But the daring few who travel in the Heechee ships usually don't know where they'll end up or what they'll find when they arrive or if they'll get back.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.600
But for those who return, the rewards can be enormous.

18:41.220 --> 18:47.760
They usually arrive with fabulous Heechee artifacts, remnants of the superior Heechee technology, which make the travelers rich.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.300
Right. Sort of a cosmic jackpot with a large risk involved.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.420
Poe offers some of the reasons why Gateway turned out so well.

18:55.980 --> 19:04.580
Well, one of the big things in Gateway was that I was under no pressure from anyone but myself to do it the way I thought it should be done.

19:04.580 --> 19:20.020
I had my publisher at that time, a principal publisher, a man named Ian Valentine, who offered me a contract with a substantial advance to write a novel without saying what the novel was going to be and without imposing any deadline on it when I had to deliver it.

19:20.480 --> 19:29.320
So I didn't have to discuss it with an editor ahead of time or write an outline and limit myself to the opportunities I could take.

19:29.960 --> 19:37.460
And I didn't have the pressure of getting it delivered at a specific date to make me rush it through.

19:38.200 --> 19:45.600
And actually, it took me, I think, six years from the time I signed the contract until I delivered it.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.340
And I had been mulling it over for several years before that.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.940
All in all, I think the book was something like ten years in the gestation.

19:53.900 --> 20:03.460
And also, it's not possible for a writer to produce at the same level all the time.

20:03.980 --> 20:06.680
I don't know why. There are times when I write better than others.

20:07.780 --> 20:15.940
I can't relate them to any outside influence or to my resolution to do well or anything like that.

20:15.940 --> 20:19.480
I just know that sometimes it comes out better than other times.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.300
And Gateway, I think, is one of the times that came out very well.

20:27.880 --> 20:32.740
The response to Gateway was strong enough to convince Paul to write a sequel, beyond the blue of enthorizon.

20:33.980 --> 20:38.740
I wasn't too hard to convince, but I did not have any such plan.

20:38.740 --> 20:46.440
I know that Gateway leaves a lot of questions unanswered and suggests a lot of things that are not made explicit in the novel.

20:47.040 --> 20:53.760
And I did all that on purpose, but not for the sake of preparing a way for a sequel.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.900
But just because I think that's the characteristic of a lot of good science fiction.

20:58.820 --> 21:05.820
When you finish the story, you think of things that let you write your own stories after it.

21:05.820 --> 21:08.560
I mean, that's the sort of thing that Harvard Clark does very well.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.260
And I think I try to do it whenever I can.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.440
And it just turned out that there was a lot of public pressure to write a sequel.

21:18.780 --> 21:23.160
Beyond the Blue Event Horizon answers many of the questions about the Heechee that Gateway raised.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.560
And in that book, Mankind even discovers what is probably the last surviving Heechee,

21:27.800 --> 21:30.740
though it's found living in a symbiotic relationship with a huge machine.

21:30.740 --> 21:37.380
Paul resolved many of the questions about the Heechee technology and revealed more about what had happened to the vanished Heechee civilization.

21:38.100 --> 21:41.680
But there are still questions about the Heechee not answered beyond the Blue Event Horizon.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.060
We asked Paul about a sequel to that book.

21:44.580 --> 21:49.120
There's also been public pressure to write another sequel, and I'm just about to sign a contract to do that.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.440
But I swear I had no such intention when I finished Beyond the Blue Event Horizon.

21:52.440 --> 21:52.520
Alright.

23:12.580 --> 23:16.500
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:32.520 --> 23:37.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.100
And here are your hosts.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.580
This is Daryl Lane.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.540
And David Carson.

23:49.540 --> 23:53.100
Frederick Paul writes different kinds of science fiction, all of it exciting.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.760
He's written action-packed space opera like the Star Child trilogy he did with Jack Williamson,

23:58.120 --> 24:01.360
and some of his more recent work like Gateway fall under that category.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.640
But Paul also creates thoughtful science fiction with the emphasis on social comment.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.000
It's just as fascinating in its own way.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.380
Space Merchants is the best example of that type.

24:11.040 --> 24:17.440
Yes, that book goes back to the 50s, but recently he's written two fine novels with social emphasis, Jim and Man Plus.

24:18.200 --> 24:24.820
Published in 1976, Man Plus depicts the world in turmoil with political intrigue, international mistrust,

24:25.120 --> 24:26.560
and the threat of nuclear devastation.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.800
Very negative picture.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.520
Paul's suggested solution is to get man off the earth, to Mars.

24:32.180 --> 24:38.260
Paul envisions a combination of man and machine, a cyborg, adapting to the red planet, and becoming native to that planet.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.700
I didn't make up the cyborg.

24:41.180 --> 24:48.400
The term and the concept was invented by two Air Force or NASA.

24:48.780 --> 24:52.800
I've forgotten which researchers in 1958 are about.

24:54.160 --> 24:58.260
And it's been used widely in a lot of places, but I didn't make it up.

24:58.640 --> 25:04.600
I think that we already see cyborgs in the sense that a lot of people have mechanical parts keeping them alive.

25:05.180 --> 25:10.780
Pacemakers and artificial plastic veins and arteries and so on.

25:10.780 --> 25:16.100
Not to mention things like glass eyes and prosthetic limbs and false teeth and so on.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.120
But ironically, it's not humans who conceive of the cyborg, but machines.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.320
To save man from himself, computers all over the world link up to form an artificial intelligence.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.000
Too far out? Not necessarily, says Paul.

25:28.880 --> 25:40.460
It's 50-50 chance, in my opinion, whether machine intelligence can ever develop these sort of independent, self-defining goals that human beings can't.

25:41.320 --> 25:46.740
But I don't think it's impossible. It's just that machines have not yet got that smart.

25:47.460 --> 25:53.240
Jim, published in 1979, also presents a chaotic world which this time succeeds in destroying itself.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.040
But some humans have escaped Earth.

25:55.040 --> 26:00.120
They're on another planet and have formed a fragile new society in combination with some aliens they meet there.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.780
Paul meant the ending to be upbeat.

26:02.820 --> 26:12.560
I think that it's hopeful. I think that what I was trying to say in Jim was perhaps a little more overt preaching than I usually intend.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.140
And I'm not sure that it came across the way I intended it to.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.520
But the subtitle of Jim is The Making of Utopia.

26:20.520 --> 26:25.940
And what I was trying to say in the novel is that you can't really plan a utopia.

26:26.080 --> 26:31.960
You cannot construct a society that will make everybody happy and productive and glad to be alive.

26:34.260 --> 26:42.140
Because the happiness, satisfaction, productivity are not a state, they're a process.

26:42.140 --> 26:53.960
And no rigid system can survive giving people maximum opportunities to realize their potential without being flexible and changeable.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.740
Much of Paul's social science fiction deals with negative societies.

26:58.180 --> 27:02.300
But Paul says he's basically an optimist and there's a reason for focusing on the bad side.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.260
I'm really Pollyanna. I'm a great optimist about the world.

27:06.260 --> 27:08.400
I think that we're in for some terrible times.

27:09.020 --> 27:16.300
And I don't think that most of us will enjoy much of what happens in the next few years.

27:16.460 --> 27:22.320
But I think in the long run the human race will straighten itself out and learn to be able to live better with each other.

27:23.460 --> 27:30.900
But as far as writing a novel is concerned, it's not too interesting to write about a utopia.

27:30.900 --> 27:36.800
What are you going to say about a bunch of people who walk around in togas and eat whole wheat bread?

27:37.540 --> 27:39.080
Never have any bad thoughts.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.900
It's much more interesting to paint the disasters that may occur as they sort of...

27:46.620 --> 27:51.360
Well, I think it's Keith Leamus who calls that kind of science fiction cautionary literature.

27:52.180 --> 27:56.340
It's not saying what will happen, it's just warning what might happen if we don't watch out.

28:03.540 --> 28:09.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:09.000 --> 28:12.140
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:05.300 --> 29:06.700
