Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.360 --> 00:33.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.020
And here are your hosts.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.900
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.340
We'll be talking to science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon this week, completing an

00:47.340 --> 00:48.740
interview we began some months ago.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.700
Sturgeon, of course, has been a science fiction fantasy writer since the Golden Age of Science

00:52.700 --> 00:54.880
Fiction, beginning in the late 1930s.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.660
Many of his novels and short stories are classics in the field, and his influence on writers

00:58.660 --> 01:00.300
who came after him has been incalculable.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.100
Sturgeon is noted as a stylist.

01:02.660 --> 01:05.820
That is, as a writer whose use of language is both distinctive and remarkable.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.160
We asked him if his style was natural to him or if it was a deliberate choice.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.980
It's absolutely deliberate.

01:11.580 --> 01:17.940
The creation of his style, as you can go a long way in the literary business, Steinbeth

01:17.940 --> 01:19.740
did it, Aldous Huxley did it.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.340
One of the stunning examples is Ray Bradbury.

01:23.120 --> 01:29.200
But you develop a style and then you stick to it, very soon you become imitable.

01:29.200 --> 01:35.280
That is to say, anybody with any real facility with words can sit down and write a pure paragraph

01:35.280 --> 01:36.160
of Steinbeth.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.500
Or for that matter, Hemingway.

01:40.380 --> 01:43.200
To imitate Hemingway and Steinbeth is very, very easy.

01:43.840 --> 01:48.360
And Bradbury particularly is extremely easy to imitate.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.180
But you don't imitate Samuel Delaney, for example.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.940
You don't imitate, I mean, nothing by the paragraph.

01:55.940 --> 02:00.060
I'm not saying that you can sit down and write a Bradbury story or a Hemingway story.

02:00.180 --> 02:00.960
That's a different matter.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.400
But you're talking just about the matter of style.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.320
And yes, it's a very conscious effort on my part to be able to write with facility

02:10.320 --> 02:12.700
in any of a number of styles.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.360
And sometimes the first person's stories.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.120
And I write out of the mouth of the person's talking.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.420
And not everybody talks in a high literary style.

02:23.420 --> 02:26.000
That's what I fought Aldous Huxley for mostly.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.140
You read an Aldous Huxley novel and Aldous Huxley talks like Aldous Huxley.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.940
And old men talk like Aldous Huxley.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.840
And little girls talk like Aldous Huxley.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.360
It's a monotone.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.800
All the words come out of all the mouths with the same kind of cadence.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.560
And I don't consider this really top writing.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.820
Why I admire Delaney so much is that when he talks ghetto black, it is for real.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.980
But if he has two characters discussing modern American poetry, they talk in the terms of

02:58.980 --> 03:02.340
William Carlos Williams or T.S. Eliot.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.780
And he knows, he's got a good ear.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.480
He knows the cadence of this kind of writing.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.140
And I admire that so very much.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.220
That you can't imitate.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.820
And so I consciously do that.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.600
Sturgeon's style is often as important to the impact of his stories as character or plot is.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.280
And he's been praised often for his attention to language.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.400
But he's not always satisfied with his work.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.200
One of his better known stories, microcosmic God, he would like to disown.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.220
It's based on a fascinating concept, a miniature world,

03:38.420 --> 03:40.960
created by a scientist with tiny intelligent beings on it.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.300
The scientist can observe centuries of development in the micro-society

03:44.300 --> 03:46.920
because these creatures live at a greatly accelerated pace.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.940
And as the tiny beings achieve an advanced high technology society,

03:51.160 --> 03:54.360
the scientist spies on them and uses their discoveries for his own purposes.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.480
But Sturgeon is not happy with his story.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.960
Yeah, I'm not too fond of that story.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.320
Not because the idea isn't unique, it is.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.620
That was a brand new kind of an idea.

04:04.580 --> 04:09.320
But because it was so badly written, it was the first science fiction story I wrote.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.460
And there was so much that I did not know about writing.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.900
One of the most important things about people as a whole,

04:17.060 --> 04:20.800
and if you're going to write people well, is that nobody's all bad.

04:21.080 --> 04:21.960
Nobody's all good either.

04:23.340 --> 04:26.660
But the heavy in there was the bank president.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.640
That he's cut out of 100% pure cardboard.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.280
He is so poorly written.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.440
And that hangers me every time I think of it.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.760
If I were to write it today, it would be very dimensional.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.120
And there'd be some good things about him too.

04:40.300 --> 04:45.180
And then you could believe in the idea itself of the little people under the dome.

04:45.280 --> 04:50.320
It was so overwhelming that nobody else but me apparently noticed how badly that story is written.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.860
More Theodore Sturgeon next time.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.640
A production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:05.640 --> 05:08.840
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:54.120 --> 05:54.680
Music

05:59.780 --> 06:02.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

06:02.520 --> 06:03.860
So stay with us.

06:19.480 --> 06:24.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.120
And here are your hosts.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.460
This is David Carson.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.240
And Daryl Lane.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.120
Theater surgeon has always constructed real, believable characters in his science fiction

06:39.120 --> 06:39.620
and fantasy.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.360
Which used to be unusual in science fiction back in the 30s and 40s when Sturgeon was

06:43.360 --> 06:44.980
establishing his reputation as a writer.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.380
Many of Sturgeon's people are, in some sense of the word, misfits.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.800
They are searching for something.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.240
They're incomplete somehow.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.440
And they're usually different than others around them.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.300
The characters in Sturgeon's novel, More Than Human, are good examples.

06:56.740 --> 06:56.920
Right.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.700
That work is built around an idiot, a pair of orphaned twins, an adolescent girl, and

07:01.700 --> 07:04.000
a mongoloid baby, all outcast from society.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.140
Many of Sturgeon's other stories have misfits as their protagonists, too.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.120
We asked him why.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.900
Well, I think a misfit has a chance to be objective.

07:12.960 --> 07:20.520
And for one thing, he sees society as a whole from its underbelly or from way off at one

07:20.520 --> 07:20.960
side.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.240
Essentially, it's not so much misfits.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.300
The key to what I write I think is loneliness.

07:29.940 --> 07:33.440
I learned early that you can write about excitement.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.680
You can write about adventure.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.600
You can write love and sex and so on.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.860
And basically, in each case, you don't hit too many people.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.480
But if you write about loneliness, everybody's an expert.

07:47.100 --> 07:52.040
I'm fond of saying that if you know some guy who collects pheasant feathers, and that's

07:52.040 --> 07:56.560
his whole preoccupation, and you write a story that involves pheasant feathers, and you

07:56.560 --> 07:58.220
know what you're talking about, he's going to love it.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.940
But the incidence of people in the general population who collect pheasant feathers is

08:02.940 --> 08:03.600
very small.

08:05.120 --> 08:11.980
But the point is that because you wrote to an expert of an expertise, if you grab it,

08:11.980 --> 08:17.440
now what are people as a whole mostly expert at loneliness?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.540
The world is full of experts on loneliness.

08:21.820 --> 08:25.040
It's something that everybody recognizes when he sees it.

08:25.100 --> 08:29.740
So it's not so much that these people are misfits, it's that they're lonely.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.500
And I think that that's the hook that I can throw into people the hardest.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.280
Sturgeon tries to counter this loneliness with love.

08:37.820 --> 08:41.780
He often has his characters lose their loneliness by experiencing love of some sort.

08:42.100 --> 08:46.340
But readers should be warned that it may not be the kind of love they're used to reading about or seeing on the movie screen.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.100
Not always.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.340
The world well lost and case and the dreamer are two of the stories that concern very different sorts of love.

08:52.780 --> 08:58.900
One of Sturgeon's best known stories is the powerful statement on love and compassion, though it's the highest sort of love given to the whole human race.

08:59.340 --> 09:04.120
The story is called Thunder and Roses, and it was published not long after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

09:04.120 --> 09:10.400
The United States has been devastated by nuclear attack, and the last American military installation that could retaliate chooses not to.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.000
The reason is to save humanity, to give our species a chance to rebuild.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.640
Sturgeon talks about the story.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.260
That's a very interesting story. That was written when the death was still settling over Hiroshima.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.900
It's probably the first atomic boom story that was written after the bomb was dropped.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.140
It was written in late 1945.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.220
I wrote that with considerable passion.

09:36.040 --> 09:41.460
There wasn't anybody in the world who understood what had happened, except the people in the science fiction fraternity,

09:41.840 --> 09:47.360
and maybe one or two rather forward-thinking scientists at Oak Ridge and the state of Washington.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.100
And for the rest of the world, it's just another big bang.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.520
But in science fiction, there, John Campbell had been publishing

09:57.420 --> 10:00.880
Atomic Power and Atomic War stories for 15 years before that.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.640
And we all understood what had happened.

10:03.780 --> 10:10.540
Every single person who'd been writing or reading science fiction understood precisely what had happened and what it meant to the world.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.660
Now, of course, it's become very much in the forefront, but we also are coming.

10:18.120 --> 10:18.920
Very bad.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.480
An ugly situation.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.320
Sturgeon says he gets a lot of response about the story and it's been reprinted many times.

10:27.260 --> 10:32.360
As a matter of fact, Ben Bober was just about to publish it in Atomic as a classic when he left.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.460
And I don't know what the situation is for the story again, but his chances at it will show up there.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.120
We'll continue our conversation with Theodore Sturgeon on our next show.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:50.180 --> 10:55.940

Music

12:10.400 --> 12:12.000
And here are your hosts.

12:15.780 --> 12:21.140
Mr. Daryl Lane and David Carson. Science Fiction Office with Theodore Sturgeon has written some great horror stories.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.120
We asked him if he enjoys writing them.

12:23.520 --> 12:29.580
Sometimes, yes, it's nice to give a... they have an amazing impact on people sometimes.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.560
Although nowadays I think they're being vastly overdone.

12:33.540 --> 12:39.380
And why people are flocking to see all these limitations of the exorcist and so on.

12:39.420 --> 12:39.880
I don't know.

12:40.220 --> 12:47.060
It's depressing, it really is. And each one you see, of course, has less impact than the one before.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.340
And it's got to be more bloody and more growy and more horrible.

12:50.340 --> 12:54.620
And more flash brains and buckets of chocor and so on.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.020
So it loses its impact. You get overdoses and that stuff.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.040
But there's a certain something in the titillation of horror.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.380
I wrote one story.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.600
It's called Professor Teddy Bear.

13:10.420 --> 13:16.080
Years later I went to a convention and the lady came up to me and she was all closed.

13:16.220 --> 13:18.480
She was all closed. You know, I thought my eyes out. She was so furious.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.340
For having written that story, it seemed that when she read it,

13:22.520 --> 13:26.500
she didn't get to sleep for two weeks. And in some peculiar way

13:26.500 --> 13:30.540
she blamed me for it. That is, as if I had personally written it,

13:30.640 --> 13:31.980
personally to upset her.

13:34.380 --> 13:38.780
However, that kind of reaction is very rare. Mostly people kind of

13:39.580 --> 13:42.500
enjoy it because basically they know their states

13:42.500 --> 13:45.580
and state of the fact that you have been living in terror for a little while.

13:54.540 --> 13:58.860
Another of Sturgeon's horror stories that has had a profound effect on some people is called Bionka's hands.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.580
It's a strange mood story about an idiot, a woman named Bionka,

14:02.760 --> 14:05.420
who has beautiful, sensuous hands with a life all their own.

14:05.880 --> 14:09.620
A young man is obsessed with her hands, marries Bionka, and the hands strangle him.

14:09.620 --> 14:14.100
Sturgeon says the idea for Bionka's hands came to him while he was involved with the sports story.

14:14.580 --> 14:18.420
I was hard at work at it and the idea for Bionka's hands came in plant-wise.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.340
And I said, in fact, go away. I'm busy.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.820
And the idea came back again. And I said,

14:25.960 --> 14:29.320
well, finally, oh, all right. And I wrote it in about three hours, that's all.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.420
Just to get it out of my way. And then I finished the sports story, which I sold it eventually.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.440
But I put that manuscript in the bottom drawer.

14:38.440 --> 14:42.560
I knew I had a very unusual story here, and I kept it like one of the family jewels.

14:43.140 --> 14:47.660
And in about three years, I got hungry enough to say, well, I got to sell the family jewels.

14:47.860 --> 14:50.100
And I found my amazement. I couldn't give the story away.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.360
It was nearly ten years before anybody would look seriously at it.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.720
But in the meantime, where I submitted it, it made...well, there were two occasions.

14:58.880 --> 15:03.120
One's an editor and one's an agent. They say, bring your stuff around and let's have a look at it, you know.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.060
I come around on Tuesday. I do it on Tuesday. And the secretary says,

15:07.060 --> 15:11.540
I want him to get a guy sitting there and he's crumbling with anger. He's furious.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.740
He says, here, take this stuff. Once he puts it off on the floor, I had to pick it up.

15:16.860 --> 15:20.400
Take this stuff and get out of here. I don't want to deal with anybody right this door like Janke's.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.560
Get out of here. Why? What's the matter?

15:23.120 --> 15:26.180
What do you say to that? Never mind. I don't want to talk about it.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.700
And, you know, I left very hurt and very puzzled.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.140
And not knowing, you know, what was going on with these people.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.960
Anyway, finally, a friend of mine wrote to me from England.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.840
There was a literary contest in England in a magazine called Argosy.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.580
And the deadline was New Year's Eve. Well, I got his letter at Christmas Eve.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.720
So I dug this thing out of the trunk and ran it through the cup

15:49.720 --> 15:54.380
without changing anything and sent it off. And it must have arrived, you know, within minutes

15:54.380 --> 15:58.960
of the deadline. And it won the contest. And I beat Graham Green and John Pudney

15:58.960 --> 16:03.300
and a number of famous people. And got the first check I'd ever seen

16:03.300 --> 16:07.820
for over a thousand dollars. And got much glory out of it.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.000
And it too has been repended a great number of times.

16:12.380 --> 16:15.200
But that's the back story on that. But where the idea came from

16:15.200 --> 16:19.440
I cannot really tell you. Sturgeon says Bianca's hands is essentially

16:19.440 --> 16:23.680
a love story. And that on a deep psychological level, death and love are intimately related.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.520
On our next show, we'll continue talking with science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon.

16:34.540 --> 16:37.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.000
Production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association. Produced in conjunction

16:41.000 --> 16:43.140
with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.020
So stay with us.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.280
Thanks for watching.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:49.580 --> 17:52.000
A commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.320
And here are your hosts.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.640
This is David Carson

18:01.640 --> 18:03.260
and Daryl Lane. Theodore Sturgeon.

18:07.140 --> 18:11.100
We asked him what changes he's seen in the field in the 40-plus years he's been in it.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.580
One thing he mentioned is the quality of writing. That it has improved greatly

18:14.580 --> 18:18.100
since the days of the Poles. And today he feels science fiction has produced authors

18:18.100 --> 18:20.340
whose work is as good as anything being written today.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.420
Sturgeon sees another large change too.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.860
The other thing that's happened of course is women.

18:27.780 --> 18:30.940
There have always been women in science fiction. As a matter of fact

18:30.940 --> 18:34.640
somebody who started science fiction as we know it was a woman.

18:35.020 --> 18:38.560
A lady who wrote Frankenstein as she was a teenager.

18:38.940 --> 18:42.060
If I had a time machine I would go back and talk to that lady.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.540
She must have been something else. Amazing woman.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.920
Amazing. I think she was 19 when she wrote Frankenstein.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.660
Mary Shelley.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.500
Mary Shelley published Frankenstein in 1819, some time ago. But Sturgeon goes on to mention

18:58.500 --> 19:01.140
the great number of modern science fiction writers who are women.

19:01.980 --> 19:06.560
The women who have been into science fiction, one of the very best was Judy Merrill.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.760
Back in the 40s he wrote some of the...well if you look in the hall of fame

19:10.760 --> 19:14.120
of science fiction you'll find a Judy Merrill story in there called

19:14.120 --> 19:17.540
That Only a Mother. Which was not only

19:18.640 --> 19:22.420
it was not only a Judy Merrill story but it was the first story she'd ever written.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.100
The first tale she ever made. She told her first story and that was it.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.960
This is an extraordinary story. Really powerful.

19:31.060 --> 19:33.160
Then there are people like I just mentioned.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.740
Then Wild Seed for example is a lovely story.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.840
There's Ursula K. Le Guin who has won a National Book Award.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.060
There's Doris Bacerque who's ideas are always so

19:46.060 --> 19:49.840
totally unexpected. There's Elizabeth Nguyen

19:51.360 --> 19:53.820
who's on and on and on.

19:53.820 --> 19:58.180
There are women in science fiction who are just extraordinary.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.920
There are other ladies in Detroit who said to me that

20:01.920 --> 20:05.860
up to now it's been...the woman

20:05.860 --> 20:09.300
has to work twice as hard and be twice as good as a man

20:09.300 --> 20:13.900
before she can get the same recognition. Then she added, fortunately, that's not

20:13.900 --> 20:16.680
difficult. Which is a great line.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.920
Surgeon believes too

20:28.920 --> 20:31.800
that not only are there a great number of women writers of science fiction

20:31.800 --> 20:33.620
but most of them are superior writers.

20:34.180 --> 20:39.060
But I admire the women in science fiction so very much. Somebody said recently that

20:39.060 --> 20:43.580
there are so many excellent women in science fiction that at long last it's possible to say that they

20:43.580 --> 20:46.320
found a mediocre one. And it has been proved.

20:46.780 --> 20:50.980
It had to be better than the men to get where they are. One of the

20:50.980 --> 20:54.780
great revelations in science fiction, of course, you no problem know about it

20:54.780 --> 20:57.780
was James Tiptree who turns out after having

20:57.780 --> 21:02.980
a shattering success to be a lady by the name of Alice Sheldon.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.520
That was the greatest knowledge for a lot of people.

21:07.260 --> 21:11.120
She kept her head under her wing for so long that altered the room restarted

21:11.120 --> 21:15.940
that she was a CIA man or that she was a collaboration between

21:16.560 --> 21:19.240
Jerry Portell and somebody else or something.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.640
But no sir, she's her own man.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.000
She's good. All of her is good.

21:26.180 --> 21:30.580
This Kate Wilhelm who writes a beautiful steady prose. Very, very good.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.800
That's the name of Night's Wife.

21:34.720 --> 21:38.720
So I'm more pleased than almost anything else about science fiction in that

21:39.080 --> 21:42.800
it has led to women in to such a total degree.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.320
And there goes almost every single one of those

21:46.320 --> 21:50.360
really got something unique to bring to the field and to

21:50.360 --> 21:53.960
literature as a whole. I'm fascinated by women.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.660
I love the way they think. There is a difference.

21:57.140 --> 22:02.100
I'm not talking just equality because there's a difference between

22:02.100 --> 22:04.200
the way men think and the way women do.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.660
I'm utterly fascinated by the way women think.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.320
On our next show we'll conclude our conversation with Theodore Sturgeon.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.380
This has been

22:20.380 --> 22:24.220
The Science Fiction Radio Show. Production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:24.220 --> 22:28.040
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.340
Music

23:14.900 --> 23:16.300
Audio

23:17.440 --> 23:21.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:37.280 --> 23:42.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.940
And here are your hosts.

23:51.020 --> 23:51.980
This is Daryl A.

23:52.040 --> 23:52.860
And David Carson.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.380
Theodore Sturgeon's writing talent would have made him successful in any form of literature

23:56.380 --> 23:57.460
he chose to work with.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.460
But fortunately he chose science fiction, and many of his stories and novels are now among

24:01.460 --> 24:03.180
the acknowledged classics of the field.

24:03.540 --> 24:06.820
More than human, published in 1953, is probably his best known novel.

24:06.820 --> 24:11.840
Some of his more famous short stories are Thunder and Roses, The Microcosmic God, Kildoser,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.720
and Slow Sculpture, which won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in 1970.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.720
Sturgeon is also convinced of the worth of science fiction and keeps up with his development and changes.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.760
We asked Sturgeon if science fiction is becoming more acceptable to the general reading public.

24:25.420 --> 24:32.280
Yeah, science fiction is becoming the mainstream.

24:32.680 --> 24:39.260
Really look at all the pictures that came out last year, for example, last summer, with a heavy emphasis on science fiction.

24:39.860 --> 24:44.740
People are beginning to realize that this forefront thinking is predictive or precognitive thinking.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.160
This is some moment.

24:47.160 --> 24:54.700
There are a lot of people who would not recognize that 1984 was a science fiction novel until very recently.

24:55.860 --> 25:05.340
I mean, things the aim is once wrote that the reaction to the general public and so-called serious critic to science fiction is,

25:05.460 --> 25:10.300
hey, this is good, this can't be science fiction, or hey, this is science fiction, it can't be good.

25:11.380 --> 25:14.740
And this is the ghetto that science fiction has to grow up in.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.540
But if you can survive in a ghetto, you generally come out strong.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.820
I think that's the case with science fiction now.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.540
But I stuck with it not because I couldn't write other kinds of things,

25:24.540 --> 25:29.880
and probably do quite well, because I simply love the field and the freedom that it gives me.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.300
Sturgeon is also the originator of what has come to be called Sturgeon's Law.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.720
He tells us how that came about.

25:36.280 --> 25:42.240
Oh, that came about sometime in the 50s, and I can't remember exactly where it was,

25:42.300 --> 25:47.520
but we would get a science fiction convention, and there was somebody who came to us.

25:47.760 --> 25:55.300
Some people like to make an impact by getting a whole bunch of people who like a particular thing

25:55.300 --> 25:57.400
and coming up and tearing it all to pieces.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.580
And he'd done his homework.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.620
He got a copy of every magazine that was in the hotel newsstand and every book,

26:05.280 --> 26:11.840
and they spent all night leafing through them, and he had a whole forearm full of book and magazines

26:11.840 --> 26:14.200
with bookmarks in them.

26:14.720 --> 26:20.740
And he convulsed the audience there for about 40 minutes with examples of some of the work syntax,

26:21.480 --> 26:26.220
some of the dumbest dialogues, some of the most improbable science, and so on,

26:27.120 --> 26:30.500
which in those days, the science fiction was a whole lot of it.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.820
And then he said to me right on stage,

26:32.980 --> 26:36.860
well you're not conceived that the science fiction is 90% crap.

26:38.620 --> 26:41.260
And I answered, I had this rush of brains with the head,

26:41.540 --> 26:46.460
and I answered him by saying, yes, that's only because 90% of everything is crap,

26:48.160 --> 26:50.040
which quite took the wind out of his self.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.960
Then I was able to go on and develop the idea, which is only true,

26:53.960 --> 26:59.420
that science fiction has been in the ghetto for so long that people say,

26:59.460 --> 27:03.220
oh, this is like Kingsley Ames said, this is science fiction, it can't be good.

27:03.840 --> 27:11.700
And it was unique as a literary genre in that it was not permitted at the spectrum of poor and good.

27:12.240 --> 27:17.700
Let us say in the mystery field, everybody could distinguish between the same Mickey Spelane

27:17.700 --> 27:20.780
and somebody like Nioh Marsh or Darcy L. Sayers.

27:20.780 --> 27:24.700
There's a spectrum of excellence there, some of these things are better than others.

27:25.340 --> 27:29.960
Same thing in the western, Hopalong Cassidy is not the same thing as Best Rewrits again.

27:31.080 --> 27:38.820
But science fiction, it was all buck barges, zap guns, and space in the year 2200.

27:40.140 --> 27:44.840
And nobody would have twice on the fact to find that there was good science fiction and bad science fiction,

27:45.460 --> 27:46.840
and excellent and poor writing.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.860
And that was that caused my response.

27:51.100 --> 27:56.780
But since then that's been caused by the surgeons law, that 90% of this is bad because 90% of everything is bad.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.100
The present company is accepted, of course.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:09.900 --> 28:12.480
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:12.480 --> 28:15.680
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
