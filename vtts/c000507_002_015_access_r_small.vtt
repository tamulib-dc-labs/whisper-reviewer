00:01.580 --> 00:03.340
I'll ask you to explain what a pastiche is.

00:04.260 --> 00:05.940
Let me ask you the question, okay?

00:08.440 --> 00:12.500
Dr. Kreider, could you explain what a pastiche is and what problems come up with the Conan

00:12.500 --> 00:13.920
material in relation to one?

00:14.180 --> 00:18.200
Well, in the sense that we've been talking about it is where one writer takes a character

00:18.800 --> 00:26.640
and a world like the Hiborion Age created by another writer and writes new stories with

00:26.640 --> 00:32.540
the same character in the same setting and he gets the full credit for the story but

00:32.540 --> 00:37.360
the other writer has created the character and the historical setting.

00:38.740 --> 00:46.480
Also DeKamp did something similar where he took incomplete Howard stories and changed

00:46.480 --> 00:54.320
them into Conan stories which would be a pastiche of a slightly different kind but it's

00:54.320 --> 01:03.000
the same principle operating and I'm not aware of any particular problems that arose except

01:03.000 --> 01:09.640
of course he would by in doing this he would have to ensure that the estate received part

01:09.640 --> 01:10.480
of his profits.

01:11.600 --> 01:17.080
Do you think that Conan is popular enough or Howard's work is so popular that perhaps

01:17.900 --> 01:21.420
we'll see an endless stream of books, pastiches by all sorts of authors?

01:22.200 --> 01:30.380
It looks like that from what we were talking about the list of people who have done or will be doing these

01:31.020 --> 01:37.420
and I don't know whether we've mentioned this but there is a planned Conan movie with Arnold

01:37.420 --> 01:46.560
Schwarzenegger as Conan. If this is a huge success like Star Wars let's say that could give even

01:46.560 --> 01:53.920
more interest to this kind of thing and we may see Howard going on forever with these pastiches being

01:54.560 --> 02:01.780
I think it's possible that they would be continued because the original idea was to fill out Conan's life

02:01.780 --> 02:08.080
you know have his life completely covered by the pastiches from I don't know the boyhood

02:08.080 --> 02:13.340
but certainly all his adult life when he was an old King Conan and it's already gone beyond that

02:13.340 --> 02:17.740
they filled out his life and then they're going back to you know this stage in his life he did

02:17.740 --> 02:22.660
such and such so certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the logical life

02:22.660 --> 02:25.640
in Conan so the potential to go on beyond is there.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.260
You mentioned what we to fill in Conan's life where do we get information about Conan's life

02:30.260 --> 02:34.620
unless it's been written in stories? Well what they did was start with what Howard had written in

02:34.620 --> 02:41.360
his stories and say if he were such and such an age in this story and then a little bit later he was

02:41.360 --> 02:45.840
in this part of the country and in Conan the Conqueror it mentions when he was a pirate

02:45.840 --> 02:51.660
in the back in his pirate days and that's part of the way he solves the the crime against fact of

02:52.240 --> 02:57.860
magical stone but so they would say well we'll write a pastiche about the pirate days

02:58.560 --> 03:03.640
so that's what I mean when I say they filled out his life. That was the plan of Lancer Books

03:04.520 --> 03:09.060
and that's what DeKamp was trying to do they were trying to arrange the books in

03:09.060 --> 03:13.920
chronological order and then DeKamp and others were writing these stories to fill in the gaps

03:14.580 --> 03:19.520
in his life but if you look at the Lancer Books I don't know how successful that was because they'll

03:19.520 --> 03:24.960
have one edition of it will say number four in the complete Conan and the next edition will say

03:24.960 --> 03:29.940
number five and it'll be the same book. Well originally though the explanation for that

03:29.940 --> 03:37.320
bill is that they issued them just they numbered them by date of publication. The first one

03:37.320 --> 03:41.480
published was number one the second one published and then they came up with this idea of the

03:41.480 --> 03:47.800
chronological series and re-numbered them all. That explains that. In other words then the author of a

03:47.800 --> 03:54.660
pastiche would be attempting to remain true to the character of Conan to what we know of his life

03:54.660 --> 04:00.720
simply to fill in the details that Howard perhaps never got to. That's what I would expect now

04:02.040 --> 04:08.840
it's true that maybe some of these writers have not necessarily been true to the character of

04:08.840 --> 04:14.700
Conan as developed by Howard. Of course everybody thinks that he's the one who's doing the true

04:14.700 --> 04:20.560
Conan stories. DeKamp thinks his are the true Conan stories because he doesn't have the violence

04:20.560 --> 04:25.680
over you know he doesn't spend a lot of time describing the gore even though it's there

04:25.680 --> 04:33.820
and because he doesn't have a lot of sex in his which Conan was practically asexual really even

04:33.820 --> 04:39.900
though he had a queen. And a son didn't you have a son too? This was in the pastiche not

04:39.900 --> 04:46.980
how I would try but then Andrew Offit I'm sure thinks that his is the true Conan but he has

04:46.980 --> 04:53.400
Conan rape a girl which Robert E Howard would have probably committed suicide earlier rather than

04:54.040 --> 04:59.460
write about rape you know this was not something that you would do. And Offit has done pastiches of

04:59.460 --> 05:09.000
other Howard characters. Hasn't he done I'm not sure didn't he do Bran McMoron? He did. For Zebra Books.

05:11.700 --> 05:18.060
Could you tell us a little bit about this this Hiborian age was this a created world of Howard

05:18.620 --> 05:21.280
was it an actual time in history or was it totally imaginary?

05:24.080 --> 05:28.580
I don't know if you can say it was totally imaginary but it was not an actual age it was a

05:28.580 --> 05:34.240
prehistoric age so everything to imagine about it could be possible that's why I argued the

05:34.240 --> 05:38.380
startups were not really necessarily in an aphrodisiac maybe they had them and then

05:39.920 --> 05:45.100
after you know had they had to be rediscovered or something but they have actually done a map

05:45.100 --> 05:49.580
and trying to trace out the places and they say it's amazing how well it fits over modern Europe

05:50.140 --> 05:57.500
and so he kind of used a European landscape. Also he has written a lot about how fascinated he

05:57.500 --> 06:05.640
was by the pics of this group of native to the island of Britain that would fight the Roman soldiers

06:06.200 --> 06:12.780
and he certainly tried to use some of the idea of the pics and the barbarians fighting the

06:13.760 --> 06:18.800
invading Romans who represented civilization but basically it is imaginary.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.540
Doesn't he also taken some of his stories I think the King Cole series back to the

06:25.500 --> 06:32.040
Atlantis or the Atlantean civilization? I think so it would be the King Cole stories those I don't

06:32.040 --> 06:37.980
know whether those have been republished recently or not I know Lancer did some of those but I haven't

06:37.980 --> 06:45.160
seen any of those in so long I'm not sure. How many Conan stories did he write that were published in

06:45.160 --> 06:52.600
his lifetime? Originals was it just a couple dozen? The only full length book was Conan the Conqueror

06:52.600 --> 06:59.080
and of course it was done serially but I would say probably not more than a dozen. Somehow I'd get the

06:59.080 --> 07:04.760
number 18. Okay now that might be 18 counting the Conan words or something. I mean counting Conan the

07:06.480 --> 07:15.360
published ones. The Brand-Mack Warren series I think he was the one who dealt with the Celtic

07:15.960 --> 07:21.840
environment the Celtic heroes. Did he publish those weird tales also?

07:27.020 --> 07:33.880
I'm sure there's probably were though or else. Where else would they fit? Yeah okay okay.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.140
I'd like before we you know we'd like to say some more specifics if we can a little bit about his

07:42.140 --> 07:46.080
work I think we probably got enough on his life do you think? Okay I'm going to start talking maybe

07:46.080 --> 07:50.620
about the Conan heroes just some general comments about his writing try to get some things you know.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.980
Make them do that thing. What? Make them into this thing right now. Oh I will yeah yeah.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.120
It's been remarked by many people that every hero that Conan wrote about and of course

08:05.120 --> 08:06.140
back out of mood again.

08:09.140 --> 08:14.740
It's been said that every hero that Howard created for for his pulp material was

08:15.800 --> 08:20.340
similar. They were all of the same type whether it was a western hero whether it was Conan

08:21.460 --> 08:25.960
whether it was King Kahl back in the days of Atlantis. They all seemed to be of a type

08:26.600 --> 08:31.200
and we remarked earlier that Howard seems to have put himself into those characters.

08:32.720 --> 08:38.580
Do you think other people are fascinated by this type of character? What draws readers or what did

08:38.580 --> 08:43.860
draw them and still draws them to this kind of this kind of hero? Dr. Crider do you think you have any?

08:45.000 --> 08:55.740
Well let's talk about men. I often wonder if women read the Conan stories with any enjoyment. They

08:55.740 --> 09:01.540
have to for research purposes like Dr. Lawson but we might ask her to admit whether she enjoys

09:01.540 --> 09:11.740
him but this is the the perfect male fantasy figure. The lone hero with his sword or maybe in a western

09:11.740 --> 09:18.880
story his pistol. I'm sure that the psychological critics can make a great deal out of this

09:20.140 --> 09:30.440
and virtually irresistible to women but who nevertheless doesn't need the company of women

09:30.440 --> 09:39.720
because he's self-sufficient. He's strong. He can overcome nearly anything and this this hero fits

09:39.720 --> 09:47.840
in the westerns. I think of one of my favorite western characters Randolph Scott from years

09:47.840 --> 09:54.980
gone by who almost always played the lone hero seldom if ever had a love story in his western

09:54.980 --> 10:04.180
movie. I think it's a great fantasy figure that probably has a powerful appeal for men. Now I'm

10:04.180 --> 10:10.540
not sure how much appeal you'd have for a woman and maybe even I probably shouldn't say this but

10:10.540 --> 10:20.160
maybe even a sort of adolescent fantasy figure and I can particularly see adolescents enjoying

10:20.160 --> 10:25.220
this kind of figure. That's when you go or at least a lot of people who go through that phase of

10:25.220 --> 10:33.180
feeling outcast or different and a fantasy figure like this really give somebody like this something

10:33.180 --> 10:41.860
to enjoy. Let Dr. Loughlin say what women might think about Conan. Well the point of being self-sufficient

10:41.860 --> 10:46.640
I think that can appeal to anyone. At some time or another everyone wants to be self-sufficient

10:46.640 --> 10:52.480
but whether or not women can really identify with Conan as an example of self-sufficiency is

10:52.480 --> 10:58.380
another matter. I must say I don't particularly enjoy reading Conan. As I said the character

10:58.380 --> 11:03.600
does not appeal to me greatly. I like the magical elements. I like the mean old whatever he was

11:03.600 --> 11:09.940
the sorcerer who brought him back to life with the magic stone the one that was brought back to life.

11:10.100 --> 11:16.260
Zaltotan I think. Yeah Zaltotan. I liked him better than I liked Conan you know the scary creatures

11:16.260 --> 11:24.680
the Stephen King type hocus pocus but I don't find Conan very appealing. In fact I do find the whole

11:24.680 --> 11:32.440
thing very adolescent even childish. Of course then again the target audience he was writing for at

11:32.440 --> 11:37.100
that time was that audience. The pulp readers the ones who get down involved the pulp magazines

11:37.100 --> 11:45.280
of the newspaper were probably mainly teenagers. Howard of course had a great I'm not sure what

11:45.280 --> 11:51.280
word to use admiration for fascination with the barbarian perhaps that's why Conan has been one

11:51.280 --> 11:56.320
of his most successful kind of heroes. Do you remember the story I think it was called The

11:56.320 --> 12:01.880
Witch Will Be Born the one where Conan was crucified. I think that's one of the most powerful scenes in

12:01.880 --> 12:06.920
the Conan series to get across the toughness. You know Conan is crucified you know his legs

12:07.520 --> 12:17.600
his arms are nailed to the cross. They pushed the cross over and he tore himself out was it if I

12:17.600 --> 12:24.580
remember. Isn't that the one where he bites the vultures head off. Yeah when he's crucified the vulture

12:24.580 --> 12:29.360
comes and lands on him you know he realizing he's going to die and he just bites the vultures head

12:29.360 --> 12:38.960
off. That was tough and what young man wouldn't love it. The taste of blood. No just the ultimate

12:38.960 --> 12:46.880
tough hero. Of course I've read people who said they like Solomon Cain as much as if not more than

12:46.880 --> 12:54.160
Conan. He was a weird sort of a hero wasn't he more of a from Puritan England. He was a misplaced

12:54.160 --> 12:59.080
Puritan who drowned the world over. Didn't most of his stories take place in Africa.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.760
And fighting African magic and a lot of those I believe.

13:07.080 --> 13:14.960
But you know these stories that we're talking about all of them seem to me to have very little

13:16.360 --> 13:22.260
that you know of a woman's element in them and women in the story just think about the character

13:22.260 --> 13:30.600
of women in the stories. They're they're just sort of there and when you need them maybe for a love

13:30.600 --> 13:35.700
scene or something. He really doesn't even have a love scene he just in Conan the Conqueror the

13:35.700 --> 13:40.160
woman is there just to get him out of prison because as you said earlier she found him irresistible

13:40.160 --> 13:46.220
when she saw him at the window three years ago as he drove by in a parade. Which is to take this up

13:46.220 --> 13:52.360
to more modern things that's exactly the way that James Bond movies work all the women find him

13:52.360 --> 13:56.840
irresistible and get him out of trouble another powerful adolescent fantasy figure.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.880
Many people make a distinction between fantasy and science fiction and Howard

14:06.880 --> 14:15.760
Howard of course is maybe the pulp fantasy writer Par excellence but he did write one science fiction

14:15.760 --> 14:21.880
book or something that could be called science fiction El Murik. The hero was a Conan type hero

14:21.880 --> 14:27.100
but he was a modern man who was projected to another planet. Similar to the way Burroughs did some of his

14:27.640 --> 14:36.680
heroes and Carson of Venus and not Carson of Venus. Similar to the way he did his hero John Carter of

14:36.680 --> 14:44.840
Mars. But Howard's didn't seem to think much of science fiction from what I've read he thought

14:44.840 --> 14:49.120
that fantasy was a more imaginative more creative process and of course this is what he was involved

14:49.120 --> 14:57.540
in. Do you think a reader can like appreciate the Howard type fantasy and perhaps a hardcore science

14:57.540 --> 15:05.700
fiction at the same time? Are they distinct type two distinct? The two things are distinct the fantasy

15:05.700 --> 15:13.420
and the science fiction but I think there are some readers who can enjoy both. I do and I think

15:13.420 --> 15:22.420
I hate to think that I'm the only one. I like to read Larry Niven's Ring World and I like to

15:22.420 --> 15:30.360
read Patricia McKillips books about the harvest and I like Robert E. Howard

15:30.360 --> 15:38.400
Hall's and I like Peter S. Beagle the last unicorn and I like Paul Anderson's Tall Zero. I

15:38.400 --> 15:45.340
read any of it. I'm not sure that everybody is that way. I think there are some readers who prefer

15:47.180 --> 15:53.940
fantasy and there are some readers who prefer science fiction just as there are some who prefer

15:53.940 --> 16:02.300
hard science fiction and I think that there's probably all sorts of in-group snobbism involved

16:02.300 --> 16:09.660
in all of these things. The hard science fiction fan doesn't particularly think very much of those

16:09.660 --> 16:20.260
people who like adventure type science fiction or maybe especially fantasy. This is putting you

16:20.260 --> 16:24.140
on the spot this question but do you have any useful distinctions or definitions that would

16:24.140 --> 16:29.760
separate the two science fiction and fantasy? Well it's not putting me on the spot since I've never

16:29.760 --> 16:40.900
read any two definitions that agree. My own distinction is that science fiction deals more

16:40.900 --> 16:49.700
with things that are probable and scientifically probable or at least possible whereas fantasy

16:49.700 --> 16:58.200
deals more with impossible things, non-existent things I regard as impossible and non-existent

16:58.200 --> 17:10.000
such as the power of magic, lost races and things of this nature and while I enjoy reading about it

17:10.000 --> 17:18.100
I really don't think that that's within the realm of possibility whereas I think space travel is

17:18.920 --> 17:23.360
but that might be putting me on the background. Some of you say well faster than light travel

17:23.360 --> 17:28.260
is an impossibility is that fantasy or science fiction and I don't want to answer it.

17:29.960 --> 17:36.020
Would you say that Conan, the Conan work of Howard, would that be typical sword and sorcery?

17:36.100 --> 17:41.800
Would that be a proper term for it? That's probably what I would call it

17:43.880 --> 17:50.620
because there's certainly plenty of sword play and there's plenty of sorcery involved in it and

17:50.620 --> 17:57.820
others some people make another distinction what's referred to as heroic fantasy which I believe

17:58.640 --> 18:04.620
is more in the Tolkien vein than the Robert E. Howard vein.

18:06.100 --> 18:11.500
Dr. Loughlin didn't, hasn't the camp written sword and sorcery type fantasy himself?

18:14.140 --> 18:21.360
He writes fantasy. I don't know if he has written sword and sorcery fantasy distinct from the Conan

18:21.360 --> 18:29.080
books or not. His fantasies generally don't involve swords do they? Well he has. Books like the Tritonian

18:29.080 --> 18:36.700
Reign for example are what I would classify as sword and sorcery but they're different from the

18:36.700 --> 18:44.940
Conan stuff they are they still have the humor in them that the camp is noted for and of course the

18:44.940 --> 18:58.720
camp has written straight historical novels like an elephant for Aristotle and golden

18:58.720 --> 19:05.820
wind and things of that nature so he has but he's done other sword and sorcery besides the

19:05.820 --> 19:10.520
Tritonian ring I'm sure if I could just think of the titles. But to me science fiction adventure

19:11.640 --> 19:17.560
is really not that much different from fantasy because so so many of them that are called science

19:17.560 --> 19:23.460
fiction adventure it takes place on another planet okay it could just as easily have been taking

19:23.460 --> 19:29.580
place in a prehistoric time they just they're getting you away from the present to some imaginary

19:29.580 --> 19:36.340
world now maybe their means of getting there are supposed to be more plausible than the means of

19:36.340 --> 19:42.080
getting there would be in fantasy but the actual plot and the adventures that take place do not

19:42.080 --> 19:47.910
seem to be that much different to me because so you use magic well is that really different from

19:47.910 --> 19:57.190
astral projection now I guess the hardcore science fiction would be more plausible than fantasy but

19:57.190 --> 20:01.470
a whole lot that goes under the title of science fiction adventure to me isn't very distinct from

20:01.470 --> 20:05.370
fantasy well there's a whole area you can't separate in which you can't separate the two they blend

20:05.370 --> 20:15.890
together David I just had a few more isolated questions Dr. Loughlin in your research you've

20:15.890 --> 20:20.790
been tracking down people here in brownwood and cross planes in the all over the place

20:21.850 --> 20:27.090
what have they had to say about Howard and what was he like well I've talked with

20:27.090 --> 20:33.350
Lindsay Tyson in cross planes and Tevis Clyde Smith here in brownwood and Jack Scott who was the

20:33.350 --> 20:39.350
newspaper editor in cross planes he was sent out as a reporter to cover the suicide he's the one

20:39.350 --> 20:45.170
who found the suicide note in the typewriter the poem which I can't quote for you it was sort of

20:45.170 --> 20:50.690
right from somebody else all bled all done pin the curtain or something like that

20:52.490 --> 20:59.670
his friends his close friends are very defensive of him as I said earlier they keep saying

21:00.250 --> 21:07.950
he wasn't crazy they objected to the term schizoid it's very painful for people like Lindsay Tyson

21:07.950 --> 21:13.510
to talk about it perhaps because he loaned the gun to him it's it is very emotionally upsetting to

21:13.510 --> 21:19.970
talk about it in much detail a great deal of guilt for everyone in cross planes who was a lot at

21:19.970 --> 21:25.630
that time he didn't fit in with the other people people did think he was nutty and then he committed

21:25.630 --> 21:30.650
suicide and I think a lot of people felt guilty particularly a friend like Lindsay Tyson and he

21:30.650 --> 21:39.210
says he never mentioned suicide to me there was he was kind of considered a harmless kook I think

21:39.210 --> 21:46.830
but after he committed suicide he didn't away transform that image in their minds he wanted to

21:46.830 --> 21:49.710
with his suicide I think to do something heroic

21:55.430 --> 22:00.030
he wanted to do something with suicide something like that right say that again I think in his

22:00.030 --> 22:05.130
suicide he wanted to do something heroic that would transform him and the eyes and all the people

22:05.130 --> 22:11.770
around him and to an extent it worked because instead of being a harmless kook he became a tragic

22:11.770 --> 22:21.390
figure he inflicted a great deal of guilt on all the people in the area most of the people remember

22:21.390 --> 22:29.570
him rather fondly some of the people do I describe his relationship with his mother is actually

22:31.690 --> 22:36.610
perverse that and they say his mother seemed to want him to commit suicide

22:37.850 --> 22:45.290
when she died she saw this as an example of his devotion you know nearly like a woman taking

22:46.510 --> 22:51.990
praise from a a suitor from a boyfriend kind of oh you know he couldn't really do that but

22:51.990 --> 22:57.170
in the same way she was trying to get him to she saw this very flattering that her son had this

22:57.170 --> 23:04.050
devotion to him didn't you say that Tyson had helped Howard do some research on some of the

23:04.050 --> 23:10.490
things that he wrote that was Smith Tevis Clyde Smith now Lindsey Tyson never had anything to do

23:10.490 --> 23:16.290
with Robert's writing he kept his life and compartments and Lindsey Tyson was in his

23:16.290 --> 23:20.610
compartment that didn't have anything to do with his intellectual life he didn't share any of his

23:20.610 --> 23:25.590
intellectual life with Lindsey Tyson what type of research would his Smith have done for Howard

23:28.170 --> 23:34.130
well he did the research for I believe the title is red blades of black cathay

23:35.090 --> 23:40.450
and I'm sure that it was simply historical background now that's noted in that book

23:41.170 --> 23:47.370
from Zebra entitled the book of Robert E. Howard he didn't do much research really he just read a

23:47.370 --> 23:51.090
book or two I don't think it's considered very accurate portrayal

23:55.310 --> 24:00.830
I understand that I read a reminiscence by E. Hoffman Price when he came to visit Howard and

24:00.830 --> 24:06.650
cross planes I understand that Howard whether this was true or not thought he had enemies

24:06.650 --> 24:11.110
and he would carry a gun in his car and Price was startled one time I think they were driving down

24:11.110 --> 24:15.590
the road and and Howard slowed down into bush and reached over and touched his gun and said you

24:15.590 --> 24:22.310
have to watch out you know I have enemies what was this all about I can't think a whole lot of

24:22.310 --> 24:26.290
this was play acting here was the fellow from California who'd come out to see him and I think

24:26.290 --> 24:32.050
he wanted to impress him with the old west image I really think and but for Howard his play acting

24:32.050 --> 24:36.850
and his life never were really clear cut you know he may have convinced himself of these things

24:36.850 --> 24:42.250
he would work when he was working out with punching a punching bag boxing his father would ask him

24:42.250 --> 24:46.110
why are you doing this and he would say well I used to have to take a lot off people and they'd

24:46.110 --> 24:50.430
push me around and now I want to be able to you know push back I want to be able to take care of

24:50.430 --> 24:55.330
myself no one that I have talked with and I've gone back to his junior high days not to his

24:55.330 --> 24:59.930
grade school days but I well yes I have I talked with Annie Newton Davis who knew him when he was nine

25:01.530 --> 25:06.990
no one can remember anybody ever picking on Robert they can't remember him ever having been

25:07.550 --> 25:12.970
involved in a scuffle in a schoolyard this seems to have been completely in his imagination

25:14.170 --> 25:17.770
and how much of it was he just trying to impress E. Hoffman Price and how much was

25:18.310 --> 25:23.690
he believed that price believed it the next paragraph after he related the episode he said

25:23.690 --> 25:27.630
and the man was not kidding me I could tell he was serious he was kidding he was not kidding

25:27.630 --> 25:32.050
that he believed there were enemies there or something you said you've gone back and talked

25:32.050 --> 25:37.870
some of his teachers how in terms of formal education how much the Howard have now I did not talk with

25:38.890 --> 25:44.510
his teachers from grade school it was Annie Newton Davis who was a neighbor who was older than he

25:44.510 --> 25:53.350
was she was about 22 and he was nine he went through cross planes which had 10 grades and at this

25:53.350 --> 25:59.270
time high school had 11 grades so he came around with high to finish his senior year you know to

25:59.270 --> 26:05.090
get the 11th year which was a senior year then and this was not at all uncommon my great uncles

26:05.090 --> 26:09.250
did the same thing they lived in small communities and they came into brownwood and they boarded in

26:09.250 --> 26:13.770
brownwood to finish that last year of high school what was uncommon is that Howard's mother came

26:13.770 --> 26:19.710
with him and kept house for him most of the boys came and kind of lived in a dormitory type situation

26:19.710 --> 26:24.990
in boarding houses and had a high time my great uncle said that he certainly did then he went back home

26:25.910 --> 26:30.730
to Howard went back home to cross planes for a couple of years and came back to Howard Payne

26:30.730 --> 26:35.630
to get a business certificate it was a one-year program and I believe it took him a year and a

26:35.630 --> 26:40.910
half or something like that took bookkeeping accounting nothing in liberal arts knowing

26:40.910 --> 26:46.230
much of history or anything like that did he ever get a job that came out of such experience or such

26:46.230 --> 26:52.710
coursework I believe he tried to get a job as a bookkeeper and lasted about a week or two he hated

26:52.710 --> 26:58.750
all of his employers again that idea of a lacking discipline saying that he couldn't stand anyone

26:58.750 --> 27:02.830
to be in authority algorithms that's why he hated school because he couldn't stand a teacher having

27:02.830 --> 27:12.390
authority algorithm what in his did Howard get out of Texas wasn't he out of state for a while

27:12.390 --> 27:16.790
in his travels I read once where he was in New Orleans for a few weeks or a brief period of time

27:17.510 --> 27:24.230
back to take some medical training and I think something to do with

27:25.870 --> 27:30.810
problems and so his father was there for some medical training at two line he lived there when

27:30.810 --> 27:34.890
he was about 13 or 14 did he see the ocean did he have any experience with the ocean that you know

27:34.890 --> 27:38.950
of that's a strange question but he did write some of his pulp fiction on sailors and sailing

27:39.630 --> 27:45.010
Texas he may have been around the Gulf because I know he did go to south Texas

27:45.990 --> 27:49.930
but I think he may have dipped into Mexico one time too but just like for two or three days

27:53.910 --> 27:59.390
you've noted before I think I would agree with this at Howard's fiction seems to be wish fulfillment

27:59.390 --> 28:05.390
in a lot of respects besides his close friends didn't he have a lot of correspondence with other

28:06.470 --> 28:10.610
professional authors who were writing for the same kinds of pulp magazines he did was that in any

28:10.610 --> 28:16.570
sense an attempt to see himself as part of a circle a group of like-minded men friendship for

28:16.570 --> 28:22.270
instance Lovecraft he had a lot of correspondence with him I understand but never met him how many I

28:22.270 --> 28:29.350
mean was this was it something that he needed was it something he you know sought out

28:29.350 --> 28:35.250
needed it and Lovecraft needed it both neither one of them I had very many close friends where

28:35.250 --> 28:40.150
they lived and certainly there weren't very many people who sympathized with Robert's literary

28:40.150 --> 28:47.030
aspirations and he felt accepted by these people as I said earlier Dr. Howard would send his baby

28:47.030 --> 28:53.770
pictures and his manuscripts to people who had never met Robert but who had corresponded with

28:53.770 --> 29:00.850
him cardially and the father was so grateful for their pen pal friendship with Robert that he would

29:00.850 --> 29:11.670
give them things that might get into the whole psychology of fandom though and the way because

29:11.670 --> 29:17.470
science fiction fandom or fantasy fandom now the writers get together the fans get together and they

29:17.470 --> 29:23.370
support each other and who else would there be and cross planes for somebody to talk to about

29:23.770 --> 29:29.470
his literary aspirations now you're probably gonna have to cut this because you have people cutting

29:29.470 --> 29:35.890
your throat but I think fandom today is very adolescent it seems like so many of the people

29:35.890 --> 29:40.730
now not all of them we were there we're not we're mature but so many of the people you see

29:40.730 --> 29:46.850
there's you can tell by looking at them somehow they don't quite fit in anywhere else they're not

29:46.850 --> 29:53.510
exactly winners and so in this little circle they're a winner except for us except for us I may

29:53.510 --> 29:57.690
now want to qualify them you're right I'll have to edit that out

30:00.190 --> 30:01.730
most of the fans are losers

30:03.290 --> 30:06.930
David that's all I would have I think we're you know myself

30:16.850 --> 30:39.670

30:52.770 --> 30:59.790
