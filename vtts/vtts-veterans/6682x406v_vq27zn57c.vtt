00:09.160 --> 00:35.085
Welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.586 --> 00:36.687
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.156 --> 00:45.988
Keith Youngblood is still a young man, but as you are about to hear, he packed an incredible story of service into the 20 years between 1987 and 2007.

00:46.909 --> 00:57.543
Service that began with one of several tours of Germany, serving five months at Operation Desert Storm and then back to Iraq for Operation Intrinsic Action.

00:58.104 --> 01:03.231
There was his two-year stint, served partially in President Clinton's communications detail,

01:03.464 --> 01:14.356
three years here at A&M as a military advisor, and then back for 13 months to Iraq as a military marksman and part of a roving sniper unit, among other duties.

01:14.376 --> 01:20.803
And I have not even mentioned the time that he and seven others were stranded on a snow-covered mountaintop in Macedonia.

01:20.823 --> 01:26.670
His story of service is truly remarkable, and we welcome Sergeant Keith Youngblood to Veterans of the Valley.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.797
Keith, it is an honor to have you here.

01:28.817 --> 01:30.139
You grew up in Avinger, Texas.

01:30.499 --> 01:34.825
People who don't know where that is, it's a very little town between Texarkana and Longview, right?

01:35.005 --> 01:35.406
Correct.

01:35.426 --> 01:36.748
It's a little bitty town.

01:37.088 --> 01:48.725
Well, at the time when I was there, I had a population of 671 people, and we had a graduating class of 11 in 1987.

01:48.765 --> 01:48.945
Right.

01:49.766 --> 01:50.988
How many stoplights?

01:51.629 --> 01:53.411
There's no stoplights in that town.

01:53.732 --> 01:55.915
We got a couple of stop signs, but no stoplights.

01:55.979 --> 01:57.981
You still got a lot of family there, though, too, right?

01:58.001 --> 02:01.826
Most of my family still lives there and all around that area.

02:02.326 --> 02:03.788
Joined the Army right out of high school.

02:04.569 --> 02:08.033
Talk about that because your dad was a Vietnam veteran.

02:08.053 --> 02:11.617
Your granddad served in World War II, so it was pretty much in your blood, right?

02:11.637 --> 02:12.659
It was tradition.

02:13.059 --> 02:19.347
Most of the male members of our family, after we graduate, we go on to serve our country in one way or the other.

02:20.948 --> 02:24.012
I joined straight out of high school.

02:25.409 --> 02:26.911
couldn't think of anything better to do.

02:27.753 --> 02:29.695
That was what was ingrained in my blood.

02:29.715 --> 02:35.204
Went to Fort Benning for basic and you became infantryman first 18 months at Fort Riley in Kansas.

02:36.265 --> 02:38.549
First of more than one tour at Germany.

02:38.609 --> 02:41.293
Talk about your first tour of Germany in the 2nd Armored Division.

02:41.834 --> 02:46.461
I was in 2nd Armored Division from 1989 to 1992.

02:46.521 --> 02:52.390
I was there when the Berlin Wall initially came down.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.673
We had

02:55.767 --> 03:06.304
I'm trying to think what they're called.

03:07.186 --> 03:13.096
All the people coming from East Berlin, we set up base camps for them.

03:14.318 --> 03:18.084
And it was just a great time helping out all those people.

03:18.224 --> 03:21.910
And then shortly thereafter, Iraq invaded Kuwait.

03:22.480 --> 03:37.681
And in January of 1991, we deployed to Desert Storm, where I spent five months as an infantry sniper and also worked as the driver for our brigade commander.

03:38.162 --> 03:48.055
So that very famous night that we all remember when Desert Storm broke out, that we all remember here stateside watching it on the news, the invasion.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.158
Where were you that day, that night?

03:50.425 --> 03:58.615
The night that that all happened, I was sitting on the berm one kilometer away from the Iraqi border.

03:58.636 --> 04:11.993
We were sitting there doing, I was attached over to a field artillery attachment and we were doing a prep fire, getting the eight hour prep fire for getting ready for the invasion.

04:12.413 --> 04:12.633
Right.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.437
You were there until May, redeployed to Germany.

04:15.907 --> 04:21.094
Lucius D. Clay Concern, talk about what your involvement was in sort of the historical part of that.

04:21.995 --> 04:32.228
Lucius D. Clay Concern, shortly after we returned from Iraq, we found out that the newest concern in Germany was getting closed down.

04:33.129 --> 04:37.695
We all were, we went through all the process of closing it down.

04:38.249 --> 04:47.144
And then on May the 14th, the day of my son's birthday, was the day that they closed the concern down.

04:47.425 --> 04:47.665
Right.

04:48.507 --> 04:54.216
And I was the last person to walk through the gates as an American citizen on that post.

04:54.236 --> 04:55.098
Part of history there.

04:55.579 --> 04:56.520
Let's move on to 1992.

04:56.761 --> 04:59.666
You were stationed at Fort McPherson.

04:59.686 --> 04:59.886
Right.

05:00.187 --> 05:05.692
Being stationed out of Fort McPherson, you went to Iraq several times as part of Operation Intrinsic Action.

05:05.712 --> 05:06.933
This was a peacekeeping mission.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.656
Talk a little bit about more what involved there.

05:09.676 --> 05:13.319
My primary mission during that was as a logistics manager.

05:13.379 --> 05:19.364
By this time, I'd already been transferred over to logistics from being injured during Iraq the first time.

05:20.385 --> 05:23.188
And they told me that I had two choices.

05:23.228 --> 05:27.251
I could either get out of the Army or I could change over to a new job.

05:27.271 --> 05:29.113
So I became a logistics person.

05:29.870 --> 05:50.395
And my job over there was ensuring that all the equipment that was coming in or out of the country was signed for specifically, and it was already had prepackaged packages set up for individual units that were coming in during that peacekeeping mission.

05:50.415 --> 05:52.197
Right, right.

05:52.217 --> 05:52.838
Want to move on.

05:52.858 --> 05:58.645
1992 to 1994, you were, like you said, in the logistics manager for the Third Army.

05:59.215 --> 06:04.683
Second tour of Germany from 1994 to 98, but in the middle of that in 1996, you were sent to Macedonia.

06:05.123 --> 06:11.753
Talk about what your mission was there and then we're gonna get to what we referred to earlier about being stranded on the mountain top.

06:12.354 --> 06:14.957
Our mission there was peacekeeping once again.

06:16.419 --> 06:20.485
My job was as a logistics manager and Humvee operator.

06:22.228 --> 06:25.092
Everybody knows what a Humvee is now from watching them on CNN.

06:25.993 --> 06:28.817
But my job was to

06:29.287 --> 06:51.143
our job there as a whole was peacekeeping on the border between um serbia and and macedonia and up in the mountains right right to just to monitor the border we've monitored the border for we had um we were there for six months and this was just to keep the stability of the region right correct that was that was your job

06:51.629 --> 07:17.974
but something happened there it turned out to be one of the scariest moments of your 20 years of service actually let's talk about when you were stranded on the mountaintop because of the weather well it is in march and the weather and if anybody doesn't know about the weather in central europe it gets relatively cool in the winter we were stranded on a mountain at 18 000 foot we were there where we're supposed to be there for

07:18.325 --> 07:45.193
a month at a time and well our month rolled around and well weather moved in helicopters couldn't come get us the convoys couldn't come get us so we were stranded there and the weather had gotten so bad and in fact that our radio communications weren't getting out as far as our people were right so we sat there and we

07:45.393 --> 07:51.821
We didn't sit down and we decided, well, we're, we're pretty sure that we're stuck up here through the winter.

07:51.941 --> 07:56.266
So we did what a little bit of hunting or whatever we could for, for food.

07:56.927 --> 08:00.532
Cause you were down, you were, you were down to one day of food.

08:00.592 --> 08:05.117
We were down to one day of food and that was canned goods.

08:05.137 --> 08:05.918
And there were eight of you.

08:06.039 --> 08:08.361
And there were eight people on the, on there.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.126
And we're sitting there one day and, um,

08:13.304 --> 08:14.726
Prayers were answered.

08:14.766 --> 08:19.252
We hear these noises coming from the side of the mountain over where the road usually is.

08:20.313 --> 08:24.378
And we look down there and we see these Finnish soldiers coming up the mountain.

08:24.538 --> 08:29.325
And we see American and Finnish soldiers, American and Finnish flags on their vehicles.

08:29.345 --> 08:31.948
And we're like, what are they doing here?

08:32.108 --> 08:34.611
And we were like, well, it doesn't matter what they're doing here.

08:34.672 --> 08:36.153
They're here.

08:37.776 --> 08:40.859
And they were a godsend.

08:41.761 --> 08:42.822
We didn't...

08:43.679 --> 08:54.897
They were the only people that had gotten our radio messages that we were out of food and we were out of fuel, and they came to our rescue.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.102
And they couldn't communicate back to you, so you didn't know that they were there.

08:58.522 --> 09:01.948
Because you all were fixing to start digging out yourself.

09:02.208 --> 09:02.508
Right.

09:02.528 --> 09:04.692
It would have been about a 185-mile trek, right?

09:04.712 --> 09:08.958
It would have been about 185 miles from the top of an 18,000-foot mountain.

09:09.399 --> 09:09.640
Right.

09:11.202 --> 09:11.863
So...

09:12.586 --> 09:18.074
Here comes this finished company and they've got food for you.

09:18.094 --> 09:20.297
So they pretty much saved you.

09:20.317 --> 09:21.199
They saved our lives.

09:23.402 --> 09:25.525
We were going to try to walk out.

09:25.545 --> 09:27.768
Otherwise you had about five shovels between you.

09:29.070 --> 09:32.856
It would have been quite a deal.

09:33.393 --> 09:37.980
Your last month in Macedonia, traveled over the Balkans for a couple of weeks.

09:38.521 --> 09:43.388
Back to Germany again in 97 and 98 for pretty much a normal deployment.

09:44.009 --> 09:47.755
And now you're next to, the thing about the Army, you move around all the time.

09:47.815 --> 09:49.758
You have no idea where you're going to be sent next.

09:50.238 --> 09:51.420
Talk about January 99.

09:51.741 --> 09:57.049
You were stationed in Arizona, but your actual operation was in Washington, D.C.

09:57.409 --> 09:58.050
a lot of the time.

09:58.435 --> 10:02.403
Yeah, I was working there and I was at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

10:02.443 --> 10:06.771
And then out of the blue one day, I get told, hey, Sergeant Youngblood, guess what?

10:06.971 --> 10:08.394
You're heading to Washington, D.C.

10:08.494 --> 10:10.198
for a month.

10:10.859 --> 10:12.843
And I'm like, what's in Washington, D.C.

10:12.863 --> 10:13.644
that I could be doing?

10:13.684 --> 10:18.233
They're like, well, you've just been detailed to the presidential communications detail.

10:19.124 --> 10:24.937
you're gonna be in charge of all the equipment for when the president moves anywhere.

10:24.957 --> 10:29.648
So I get the chance to visit the White House.

10:30.189 --> 10:37.065
I get a chance to fly around, not on Air Force One, but I got a tour of Air Force One

10:37.045 --> 10:43.274
and got to fly around on all the presidential details when some of the missions that he flew on into different locations where he went.

10:43.594 --> 10:44.255
Right.

10:44.275 --> 10:49.362
It's quite a bit different from the deployments that you were used to, the foreign deployments.

10:49.402 --> 10:55.430
This was more of a little bit fancier type of deal, like tagging along with the president.

10:55.450 --> 10:56.472
This was a lot fancier.

10:56.492 --> 10:59.836
This was suit and tie instead of uniform anymore.

11:00.257 --> 11:03.441
So it was a great change.

11:03.421 --> 11:04.642
It was a great experience.

11:04.863 --> 11:09.528
So you rotated to Washington a lot from Arizona for this communication detail.

11:10.690 --> 11:20.922
And I guess from that standpoint, I wouldn't say you got to know President Clinton well, but you visited with him some, I suppose, right?

11:21.022 --> 11:21.462
I did.

11:21.682 --> 11:25.547
I met President Clinton on several occasions.

11:26.236 --> 11:29.579
I got to know his security detail very well.

11:29.599 --> 11:29.899
Exactly.

11:29.919 --> 11:33.402
Because if you didn't become friends with them, you didn't get to visit with the president.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.464
Right.

11:35.484 --> 11:39.548
2001, of all places, you're transferred to College Station, to Texas A&M.

11:39.868 --> 11:45.893
Talk about what your duty was here at A&M as sort of an adjutant to the Corps, right?

11:45.913 --> 11:46.273
Correct.

11:46.313 --> 11:50.817
I was a military advisor for Company L1.

11:51.758 --> 11:56.142
And then I was also the supply sergeant for the Army ROTC detachment.

11:57.202 --> 12:07.621
I ensured that at the time, I believe there were 570 Army cadets and ensured that they had their uniforms.

12:07.641 --> 12:17.640
And when we went to the field, I made sure that I got all their food and water and ammunition and just basically was a friend to the Corps.

12:18.278 --> 12:21.381
And that wasn't a bad gig because you'd been an Aggie fan, right?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.163
I've been an Aggie fan all my life.

12:23.323 --> 12:23.563
Right.

12:23.704 --> 12:25.906
So this was a good place to be for you.

12:25.926 --> 12:27.527
So you didn't mind that deployment at all.

12:28.208 --> 12:31.531
But it didn't go on forever, as nothing does in the Army.

12:32.092 --> 12:33.714
So you were here for about three years, is that right?

12:33.914 --> 12:35.696
I was here for about three and a half years.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.577
Three and a half years.

12:36.617 --> 12:38.559
December of 2004, back to Fort Hood.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.101
Talked about what your training was there.

12:41.181 --> 12:43.864
Obviously, it was training to go to Iraq.

12:44.384 --> 13:01.022
I got back to Fort Hood in December of 2005 and when I got there the first, I'm sorry, it was December 2004, I got there and the first thing that I find out is that I'm going to a unit that doesn't exist.

13:01.983 --> 13:02.964
Yeah, talk about that.

13:03.004 --> 13:07.589
And they tell me that you're going to 2nd of the 77th Field Artillery Regiment.

13:08.250 --> 13:13.395
And so I went on the website for Fort Hood and looked around and I

13:13.628 --> 13:14.950
There's nothing there about them.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.714
I'm like, what the heck is going on here?

13:17.734 --> 13:18.696
So I talked to them.

13:19.057 --> 13:24.044
I called over to this ghost unit.

13:24.385 --> 13:30.955
They gave me a phone number and I talked to this captain and he goes, you're Sergeant Youngblood?

13:31.015 --> 13:31.436
I was like, yeah.

13:31.456 --> 13:32.618
He goes, why aren't you here yet?

13:32.638 --> 13:35.923
He goes, you're going to be the first sergeant for my company.

13:36.494 --> 13:38.938
I was like, okay, I've never heard of the unit.

13:38.958 --> 13:43.846
I've been around Fort Hood all my time when I was at Texas A&M.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.789
I've never met anybody from this unit.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.134
He goes, oh, we're just starting up.

13:50.336 --> 13:54.623
He goes, when you get here tomorrow, you're going to be the third person in the unit.

13:55.805 --> 13:59.411
And I was like, what are we being stood up for?

13:59.431 --> 14:03.497
He goes, well, we're going to be the artillery corps.

14:03.781 --> 14:10.730
In one year, we're deploying to Iraq and we're going to be the sole artillery for the International Green Zone.

14:12.412 --> 14:14.055
I was like, okay.

14:15.336 --> 14:25.309
Essentially what we're talking about is you're teaching kids how to fight the war, how to stay alive, how to avoid IEDs, how to drive in Iraq.

14:26.050 --> 14:27.572
And these are raw recruits that you're teaching.

14:27.973 --> 14:30.396
We had raw recruits out of the...

14:31.422 --> 14:39.150
The first 176 people that we had come into the unit were straight out of basic training in AIT.

14:39.411 --> 14:52.284
They were artillerymen, we had infantrymen, cavalry scouts, supply, all kinds of just anything that you could think of as far as a unit.

14:52.304 --> 14:55.668
We had those, and they were all brand new kids with no leadership.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.611
So we had to...

14:59.620 --> 15:02.483
We had our time on our hands teaching these kids.

15:02.503 --> 15:11.812
Yeah, less than a year later, November 2005, you leave for Iraq for a 13-month tour one year after this unit was brought into existence, less than a year.

15:12.032 --> 15:12.573
Less than a year.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.474
After the unit was brought into existence.

15:15.135 --> 15:16.076
Talk about your duty there.

15:16.096 --> 15:20.861
You were supposed to be a battalion logistics officer, but they found out that you were a pretty good shot.

15:21.641 --> 15:26.386
So that was changed, and you were given a job actually at the U.S.

15:26.446 --> 15:27.467
Embassy in Baghdad.

15:27.920 --> 15:42.016
Yeah, I was told about a month into the deployment, we were out just shooting, and we were training Iraqi soldiers, and they found out that I was a pretty decent shot.

15:43.017 --> 15:50.566
So someone went back and researched my military records and found out that I'd been through sniper school years earlier.

15:51.627 --> 15:55.311
And so as soon as they found out that they had a sniper in the green zone,

15:56.033 --> 16:03.242
they moved me immediately from my normal job as a logistics officer to being the sniper for the U.S.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.264
Embassy.

16:06.045 --> 16:10.571
We had a platoon of snipers and they made me the first sergeant of it.

16:10.971 --> 16:11.272
Right.

16:11.772 --> 16:15.537
So you were hanging out on the rooftop of the embassy?

16:15.857 --> 16:19.462
Spent 24 hours a day, six days a week up there.

16:19.522 --> 16:21.484
We got one day off to shower and

16:22.291 --> 16:24.454
Looking for the bad guys, looking for the people coming in with car bombs.

16:24.534 --> 16:26.396
Looking for anybody coming in with car bombs.

16:26.436 --> 16:27.938
Looking for people coming in with car bombs.

16:28.438 --> 16:29.199
And that was your job.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.123
But again, like most jobs, that didn't last.

16:32.163 --> 16:41.595
And you were moved to what I would suppose as you regard as probably the most dangerous job that you had, certainly, as part of this roving sniper group.

16:42.295 --> 16:47.742
Talk a little bit about that and sort of some of the intensive events that that involved.

16:48.059 --> 17:09.846
Well, I was told, I guess it was in April, late April, early May, that we were pulling off the rooftops and we were going to start going out and setting up what they called flash TCPs, just traffic control points.

17:10.867 --> 17:16.935
And our job was going to be just to check every vehicle that came through there

17:17.084 --> 17:29.183
And we set up zones where if a person was within a certain amount of one zone, we flashed them with a flashlight and said, you can't come any further than this.

17:29.203 --> 17:33.309
And if they kept coming, then as it got closer, then we would use deadly force.

17:34.350 --> 17:44.586
Well, one day we were sitting there and an IED or a vehicle came along and he was barreling towards us and we had no way of stopping him.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.808
Finally,

17:46.008 --> 17:54.723
Charlie One, he was, I can't give you his real name, but he, Charlie One was my, one of our snipers.

17:54.743 --> 18:09.429
He had to take a shot and when he did he hit the ordinance that was in the back of the vehicle and 25 yards from us this 500 pound IED explodes right there in our lap.

18:09.649 --> 18:09.990
Wow.

18:11.354 --> 18:14.878
That was quite an interesting day.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.760
Luckily, nobody was hurt.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.662
None of our guys were hurt.

18:20.044 --> 18:21.366
I bet there were a lot of days like that.

18:23.568 --> 18:26.792
I want to move on because we need to get to an important part.

18:26.852 --> 18:28.554
But I want to look at some pictures.

18:28.574 --> 18:29.735
This would be a good time to do that.

18:29.795 --> 18:33.239
Some photographs that you've supplied from your time in Iraq.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.621
So let's go ahead and go with them.

18:34.641 --> 18:35.582
And here's the first one.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.464
You and a couple of buddies there.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.205
Where was that taken?

18:38.320 --> 18:41.524
That was taken at the Australian compound.

18:41.805 --> 18:45.410
That's under my right arm.

18:46.531 --> 18:47.993
That's my best friend in this world.

18:48.013 --> 18:48.914
That's Dwan Miller.

18:49.856 --> 18:54.522
And the guy beside him became a very close friend of mine.

18:55.443 --> 18:57.186
He was one of our snipers.

18:57.226 --> 18:59.328
That's Colin Rogan.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.932
He's an Australian sergeant sniper.

19:03.616 --> 19:06.139
Colin, as we're looking at the picture, is on the left or the right?

19:06.159 --> 19:09.864
Colin is on the, as we're looking at the picture, Colin is on the right.

19:09.884 --> 19:10.705
He's on the right.

19:10.725 --> 19:11.526
Okay, let's move on.

19:12.467 --> 19:13.228
You're on the right there.

19:13.489 --> 19:19.036
I'm on the right there, and that's, once again, Duane Miller, my buddy.

19:19.917 --> 19:22.821
And in the middle is Mohammed Atta.

19:23.522 --> 19:31.052
He was an engineer that worked for us there at the embassy.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.914
He did all of our work.

19:33.147 --> 19:34.428
anything that we needed.

19:35.450 --> 19:36.551
He became a very close friend.

19:36.571 --> 19:47.863
In fact, he's already come over from Iraq once to visit, and he's looking at in December of this year, he's going to come back over and visit with me again.

19:47.883 --> 19:48.844
Okay, let's move on.

19:50.026 --> 19:51.367
Real quickly, what are we looking at there?

19:51.467 --> 19:54.951
This is the award ceremony on the last day I was in Iraq.

19:55.011 --> 20:00.598
They were giving us all of our awards for our service during the 13 months.

20:00.858 --> 20:01.278
Very good.

20:01.579 --> 20:01.939
Next.

20:03.016 --> 20:07.680
That was my getup for one specific sniper mission we went on.

20:07.740 --> 20:14.006
They wanted us to blend into the local populace.

20:14.667 --> 20:15.687
And that's the way you did it?

20:15.707 --> 20:16.568
That's the way I did it.

20:16.668 --> 20:17.169
There you go.

20:17.589 --> 20:18.070
That works.

20:19.331 --> 20:20.792
That's Moneer Ata.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.474
I'm sorry, that's Qasim Ata.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.315
He's got a twin brother named Moneer.

20:25.016 --> 20:25.737
That's Qasim.

20:26.617 --> 20:28.599
He was one of the Ata brothers.

20:28.619 --> 20:30.981
He was also one of the engineers and became very close friends.

20:31.642 --> 20:31.842
All right.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.861
Next picture, your official photograph.

20:34.881 --> 20:36.142
That's my official photograph.

20:36.483 --> 20:38.425
That was taken in 2005.

20:39.707 --> 20:42.711
Just before we went to Iraq, they had those photos made of us.

20:43.412 --> 20:49.019
In case we didn't make it back, they had a good picture to have for our funerals.

20:49.419 --> 20:50.000
Oh, my goodness.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.223
You can look at it that way, certainly.

20:52.663 --> 20:53.104
Okay.

20:53.810 --> 20:54.892
What is that?

20:55.613 --> 21:00.100
The statue behind me is a bust of Saddam Hussein.

21:01.502 --> 21:03.485
Those were on every one of his palaces.

21:04.106 --> 21:10.776
As you can tell, I'm 5'9", and you can tell how tall that thing is from how it looks against me.

21:12.518 --> 21:19.088
But that one was inside the international zone, and it was a photo opportunity as soon as I saw it.

21:19.108 --> 21:20.290
Okay, let's move on.

21:20.860 --> 21:21.761
It's an interesting picture.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.803
I have no idea what it is, but you gave it to me.

21:23.823 --> 21:24.763
So what is that?

21:24.823 --> 21:27.286
That's a picture of my room in the embassy.

21:29.527 --> 21:34.612
The couch and the rug were there when I moved in.

21:35.533 --> 21:43.840
Those belonged to some high-ranking official in Saddam's his regime.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.942
And when I moved in there, I took it over.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.905
The other thing sitting on this is my

21:50.729 --> 21:55.036
That's my tactical shotgun sitting on the couch.

21:57.420 --> 22:07.576
Picture of me having a buddy of mine, Greg Bremseth, and I having dinner with the Atta family.

22:08.057 --> 22:11.823
These are the ones that weren't ever in the green zone.

22:11.843 --> 22:13.326
They didn't get to meet American soldiers.

22:13.346 --> 22:17.192
So as soon as they got the chance, they wanted photo opportunities.

22:18.590 --> 22:21.295
We ate dinner with them on a regular basis.

22:22.497 --> 22:23.519
Some interesting food.

22:24.661 --> 22:25.121
Very good.

22:27.025 --> 22:28.547
Interesting photographs.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.134
May the 14th is a significant day in your life.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.658
Your son was born on that day in 1991.

22:34.798 --> 22:39.266
That makes it a happy day.

22:39.286 --> 22:41.450
In 2006 makes it a very sad day for you.

22:41.510 --> 22:42.572
Talk about what happened that day.

22:43.160 --> 23:10.348
May the 14th at about 1.30 in the afternoon, I was with my roving band of snipers, as everybody like to call us, and we got hit by an IED, and there were four other people in the vehicle, and one of my gunner had been in the hatch for a long time that day, and I told him,

23:11.105 --> 23:13.229
Look, you've been in there long enough today, Danny.

23:13.249 --> 23:18.217
Let me jump in the hatch and give you a break, let you get down and get some air conditioning.

23:18.598 --> 23:23.726
After a little bit of arguing and stuff, he finally decided he was going to come down and get some air conditioning.

23:24.207 --> 23:28.895
About five minutes later, we hit an IED and I was the only survivor.

23:30.277 --> 23:33.563
I was lucky I didn't, I was breaking all the rules.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.826
I didn't have my gunner's harness on.

23:35.866 --> 23:36.808
I didn't have the

23:37.733 --> 23:40.917
anything else on it because I knew we were just right outside of the compound.

23:40.957 --> 23:43.379
We weren't going to be alone.

23:43.399 --> 23:48.986
And I was blown out of the vehicle and everybody else was killed.

23:49.006 --> 23:52.049
You lost four of your soldiers that day on, on May the 14th.

23:52.069 --> 23:54.933
And that leads us to, we've got about four minutes left here.

23:55.753 --> 24:01.620
Um, you were diagnosed a disability besides physical pain, back and ankle pain.

24:02.341 --> 24:06.846
Uh, you were also diagnosed with a medium to extreme, uh, PTSD, post-traumatic stress.

24:07.332 --> 24:08.934
a disorder.

24:10.496 --> 24:22.329
Talk about that, how it's affected your life, but the main message that you want to send is to others who are in Iraq right now are coming back.

24:22.349 --> 24:23.010
The stage is yours.

24:23.090 --> 24:23.651
Talk about that.

24:24.191 --> 24:24.452
Okay.

24:24.852 --> 24:27.615
PTSD is nothing to be ashamed of.

24:28.657 --> 24:31.200
At first when I got back, I was ashamed of it.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.044
I said that I thought it was a sign of weakness.

24:36.020 --> 24:38.703
There's no way this can happen to me.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.185
This happened to Vietnam vets.

24:40.365 --> 24:41.627
They were the ones that had it bad.

24:43.329 --> 24:57.285
The message that I want to put out to soldiers and to veterans is that if you have PTSD, or if you have an inkling that you have PTSD, go get seen immediately.

24:57.966 --> 25:00.569
You can't solve it by yourself.

25:01.009 --> 25:04.373
It's the silent killer of veterans.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.568
I don't know what else to tell people.

25:08.589 --> 25:13.775
It's just get help.

25:15.077 --> 25:15.578
It helps you.

25:16.699 --> 25:17.580
It helps your family.

25:19.343 --> 25:22.066
So like the message you're trying to say is exactly like you.

25:22.987 --> 25:30.577
You thought it was something to be ashamed of, that you didn't want to confront the denial stage and everything that you go through on that.

25:30.597 --> 25:33.381
And what you're wanting to tell young men that have come back

25:33.597 --> 25:44.313
that have gone through a traumatic experience like you did on May 14, 2006, or any type of experience that you're having trouble sleeping, whatever, don't be afraid to go get help.

25:44.353 --> 25:47.538
There are facilities and there are people especially for that.

25:47.718 --> 25:47.979
Right.

25:48.019 --> 25:52.746
You can go over on Rock Prairie Road, right here in College Station.

25:53.226 --> 25:53.447
Right.

25:53.467 --> 25:54.909
You can go over there.

25:55.890 --> 25:56.832
I don't have it with me.

25:56.852 --> 25:57.413
I wish I did.

25:57.913 --> 26:00.297
There's an 800 number that you can call.

26:01.120 --> 26:06.888
And it's the Veterans Administration suicide assistance hotline.

26:06.908 --> 26:07.609
Right.

26:07.769 --> 26:15.039
They will talk to you if you're thinking of doing anything harmful to yourself or if you're just feeling down, they'll talk to you.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.601
Right.

26:16.782 --> 26:23.190
But just one thing is get help, please.

26:24.052 --> 26:24.352
Get help.

26:24.392 --> 26:25.734
That's what it's for.

26:25.754 --> 26:28.798
2006, you went back to Fort Hood.

26:29.740 --> 26:31.823
you decided at that time to retire.

26:32.063 --> 26:37.610
They gave you the opportunity to re-up for some more, but you decided at that time it was time for your family, right?

26:37.630 --> 26:38.651
20 years you'd put in.

26:38.671 --> 26:40.473
20 years and 27 days.

26:40.673 --> 26:47.242
Well, at the time it had been 19 years and they offered me a promotion and I turned it down.

26:47.302 --> 26:50.866
I was like, the time has come for me to spend with my family.

26:52.108 --> 26:58.195
I've drug my wife and my son around this, all over this country and all over this world for the last

27:00.250 --> 27:25.195
going on well for 18 years that we'd been married at the time and for 17 years of my son's life and i decided it was time that we hang up the hat and become a civilian it was a good decision after 20 years and it's uh and i know you're very involved with the veterans of foreign wars here and uh and we appreciate your service but we're out of time and thank you for your story and for your service thank you very much thank you keith

27:25.867 --> 27:37.300
In 2008, Keith Youngblood was offered a promotion and another tour of Iraq, but he rightly decided that it was family time, a time well earned in two decades of service to his country.

27:37.320 --> 27:46.130
His courage extends beyond those times that he was in harm's way to today as he shares his own inner battles so that his story might help others.

27:46.150 --> 27:50.815
For that and his exquisite service, we salute Sergeant Keith Youngblood.

27:50.835 --> 27:51.736
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:51.756 --> 27:54.439
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
