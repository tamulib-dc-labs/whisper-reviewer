00:08.570 --> 00:32.941
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.961 --> 00:33.902
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.810 --> 00:40.517
Holly Rees caught the tail end of World War II, but Purple Hearts were still being earned even then.

00:40.537 --> 00:45.843
It was after the Allied victory in Europe had been won, but well before the battle in the Pacific was finished.

00:46.344 --> 00:56.536
June 21, 1945, that's when Sergeant Holly E. Rees, Company I of the 184th Infantry, was wounded in the foot during the brutal battle for Okinawa.

00:57.056 --> 01:02.843
He had been on the ground just 32 days when he had to put down his rifle, but it was 32 days he'll never forget.

01:03.363 --> 01:10.514
Holly Rees and his wife, Betty, live near the dividing line of Bryan and College Station, and today he is my guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:10.534 --> 01:12.517
Sergeant Rees, it's a pleasure to have you.

01:13.298 --> 01:16.804
Let's talk sort of from the beginning right before your service started.

01:16.824 --> 01:25.337
You grew up, raised, born in Prescott, Arizona, and it wasn't too long between graduation and when you were off to service, was it?

01:25.672 --> 01:34.159
It actually started on January 21st, 1944, when I had my 18th birthday.

01:34.179 --> 01:43.327
And since I had just started my final semester in high school, I applied for a deferment so that I could graduate with my class.

01:44.128 --> 01:50.253
I was the class president and valedictorian, so I wanted to be sure and graduate with everybody else.

01:50.313 --> 01:55.678
But we had graduation on a Friday night, the 3rd of June.

01:55.658 --> 02:05.752
And Monday morning, June the 6th, before daylight, we were on the bus heading for Phoenix for pre-induction physicals.

02:05.772 --> 02:09.137
That was June the 6th, 1944, which also happened to be D-Day.

02:09.157 --> 02:09.638
D-Day.

02:11.100 --> 02:20.113
So we fully expected that we would be going in any day, being called, but went all summer, never did get the call.

02:20.954 --> 02:27.681
So a buddy and I, around September the 1st, went down to the draft board and said we were tired of waiting.

02:27.761 --> 02:29.763
And so we volunteered.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.887
And a couple of weeks later, we were in the Army.

02:33.907 --> 02:39.872
And I know that for a while, you were pretty certain that you were going to be called to go to Europe to fight in the Battle of the Bulge.

02:39.952 --> 02:44.217
But the timing was such that you never really went to Europe, right?

02:44.237 --> 02:48.801
We were supposed to get 15 weeks of basic training.

02:48.781 --> 02:56.088
And about the time we had 11 weeks of training is when the Battle of the Bulge occurred in Europe.

02:57.170 --> 03:06.699
And they were taking the oldest class, which had 14 weeks of training, and flying them to Europe to throw them into the Battle of the Bulge.

03:06.719 --> 03:11.084
And a few days later, they took the 13th week and the 12th week.

03:11.184 --> 03:15.328
And the battle broke, and we didn't have to...

03:15.865 --> 03:20.630
didn't get to go to Europe, so we were destined to go to the Pacific.

03:20.650 --> 03:21.391
To go to the Pacific.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.855
You probably would have preferred going to Europe the way that the war was fought.

03:24.995 --> 03:30.481
Except I didn't enjoy the prospects of snow and ice in the Battle of the Bulge.

03:30.541 --> 03:34.666
I've had veterans of the Battle of the Bulge, they say it's the coldest that they've ever been in their lives.

03:34.986 --> 03:41.634
You had applied for OCS, Officer Candidate School, at Fort Benning, but your eyesight kind of let you down, so you didn't get to go that direction.

03:41.654 --> 03:45.378
Instead, you went to Fort Ord and eventually to the Pacific, right?

03:45.398 --> 03:45.518
Right.

03:45.498 --> 04:04.119
Actually, we went from Fort Ord to Fort Lewis and shipped out from Seattle, and then we made a short stop on Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, and then another stop on Saipan, and then made the final jaunt from Saipan to Okinawa.

04:04.499 --> 04:05.701
Right, right.

04:05.721 --> 04:11.387
You remember the 7th Amphibious Infantry Division, which on April Fool's Day they had

04:11.705 --> 04:12.989
landed at Okinawa.

04:13.110 --> 04:15.297
You came a little bit later than that.

04:15.317 --> 04:16.380
I came in as a replacement.

04:16.521 --> 04:18.246
Right.

04:18.267 --> 04:23.925
Actually the battle had been going on for 50 days when I joined the fray.

04:24.513 --> 04:26.135
And you were just 19 years old.

04:26.155 --> 04:29.518
I mean, barely 19 years old at the time.

04:29.538 --> 04:35.504
What were your thoughts from Prescott, Arizona, being in high school to just a few months later, you're about to fight a war.

04:35.984 --> 04:44.872
In a few minutes, you're going to show a picture of the ships in the sea and being a landlocked Arizona.

04:44.913 --> 04:50.638
And when I saw thousands of ships, that just blew me away.

04:52.120 --> 04:59.469
As far as you could see in any direction, there was freighters and destroyers and battleships and aircraft carriers.

04:59.870 --> 05:05.397
I think you told me that Okinawa was the second largest armada that was ever assembled, actually.

05:05.778 --> 05:10.163
The D-Day in Europe was the largest and Okinawa was the second largest.

05:10.343 --> 05:17.853
Now, as a replacement, you took a special kind of soldier, obviously, because you had to do your job on really a minimal amount of training.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.136
Ten days training and you were in combat, right?

05:20.555 --> 05:22.617
Well, a lot of them didn't even get that.

05:22.657 --> 05:32.109
We were lucky that we were able to join the division in reserve and get to meet and get oriented with everybody.

05:32.149 --> 05:41.480
But we had additional replacements that came under the front line, just walked up and handed a rifle and you're in business.

05:41.540 --> 05:48.368
But we had the advantage of having 10 days with the division before we went into combat.

05:48.635 --> 05:56.827
As a matter of a history lesson for the people who may not be aware, talk about Okinawa and why it was so important to the future plans of the war.

05:57.889 --> 06:05.040
Okinawa was 350 miles south of Kyushu, the southernmost island of Japan.

06:06.168 --> 06:23.012
and it was 67 miles long and two and a half to 18 miles wide and 640 square miles which is only 10 percent larger than Brazos County so it wasn't a big but it was ideally located

06:22.992 --> 06:26.937
They planned to have at least a half a dozen airfields.

06:27.798 --> 06:36.310
It had three major harbors, and that was to be the staging area for the assault on the Japanese mainland.

06:37.071 --> 06:41.797
So that was very strategic in location and situation.

06:41.817 --> 06:47.444
It was going to be the staging area, the supply center, the landing strips were going to be there.

06:47.504 --> 06:50.248
This was going to be really the headquarters of where

06:50.583 --> 06:57.453
the eventual ground assault on Japan was going to go from the ground assault that never happened because of the decision to drop the bomb.

06:58.995 --> 07:03.341
Well, the plans were in November of 45 to land on Japan.

07:03.361 --> 07:08.068
So if the war hadn't ended that summer, then that was the next.

07:09.450 --> 07:15.679
So it ended up that Okinawa was the last battle of the World War II.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.605
And it was the largest battle in the Pacific also.

07:19.226 --> 07:27.277
You were heavy as a ground soldier with a rifle for 32 days and the largest ground battle actually in the Pacific.

07:27.758 --> 07:33.066
Talk more about what you remember about those 32 days leading up to May the 21st when you were wounded.

07:33.526 --> 07:39.675
Actually it was the only battle in the Pacific that involved an army.

07:40.178 --> 07:55.808
the army participated but the technical term army consisted of seven divisions three marine divisions and four army divisions so we had approximately 105,000 ground troops

07:55.788 --> 07:58.531
engaged on Okinawa.

07:59.933 --> 08:20.918
And to me it was interesting that from when I went into combat in 32 days we moved 8 miles which averaged about a quarter of a mile a day for some days we didn't move at all but it averaged a quarter of a mile a day for 32 days.

08:21.556 --> 08:25.083
Were you under constant resistance during these 32 days?

08:25.103 --> 08:27.247
Were you, I mean, you were fighting a battle most every day?

08:27.387 --> 08:28.228
Day and night.

08:28.469 --> 08:29.050
Right.

08:29.070 --> 08:32.637
The Japanese nearly always counterattacked at night.

08:32.677 --> 08:36.023
So about that, we were ready to call it a night.

08:36.063 --> 08:40.071
They were just getting geared up for a Banzai attacker.

08:40.091 --> 08:45.100
And luckily we had destroyers offshore.

08:45.772 --> 09:14.884
that had five inch naval flares and we could get on the radio and call for the lights and the Navy would lob these flares up in the air with little parachutes and they'd flutter down and just a steady stream of them they could light up the night almost as bright as day so when the Japanese were coming in under cover of darkness we could call JASCO and get the flares coming in and it helped our situation a whole bunch

09:14.864 --> 09:16.266
Indeed, incredible.

09:16.988 --> 09:22.518
May the 21st, 1945 was your first day in combat.

09:22.958 --> 09:27.947
But on June the 21st, a month later, 1945 was the day that you were wounded.

09:28.288 --> 09:32.155
Talk about that and how that came to be.

09:32.175 --> 09:35.100
One of the things that a lot of people don't understand

09:35.890 --> 09:48.361
is that when we approached the Japanese, our objective was to kill them, shoot for the head, the body, and they were better off eliminated.

09:48.381 --> 09:51.148
But the Japanese had a policy

09:51.128 --> 10:01.683
That if we weren't in an imminent threat just right on top of them, that if a sniper by choice, that they would shoot us to wound us.

10:02.625 --> 10:08.633
So many of our wounded were shot in the foot like me or in the leg or something.

10:08.733 --> 10:14.261
And the theory was that if you were dead, they shoved you aside and went on.

10:14.802 --> 10:20.410
But if you were wounded, they had to have a medic to take care of you.

10:20.390 --> 10:28.348
take you back to a hospital and have doctors and nurses and medications and eventually hospitals and rehabilitation.

10:28.388 --> 10:36.225
So strategically we were much more of a liability as a casualty than we would have been as a fatality.

10:36.566 --> 10:37.748
Right, right.

10:38.209 --> 10:39.833
It involved more people.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.455
I was always very grateful for that policy.

10:42.816 --> 10:43.857
You bought into it quite.

10:44.017 --> 10:45.819
I bought into that.

10:45.839 --> 10:46.679
Indeed.

10:46.739 --> 10:49.322
So you were wounded on June 21st, 32 days.

10:49.342 --> 10:53.766
And ironically, that was also, you say, the day that Okinawa was declared secure.

10:53.866 --> 10:55.087
They declared it secure.

10:55.147 --> 10:56.288
Wasn't so secure.

10:56.328 --> 10:58.130
We decided it wasn't quite secure.

10:58.470 --> 11:00.973
Wasn't secure enough for Sergeant Rees, right?

11:01.934 --> 11:07.879
After that, you sort of went to a series of hospitals there in Okinawa, then to Guam, and eventually

11:08.315 --> 11:10.512
What was your path back to the United States?

11:10.778 --> 11:16.483
Well, first it was a naval hospital on Guam, which was an interesting experience.

11:16.543 --> 11:20.587
We had Navy beans for breakfast every morning in the Navy hospital.

11:21.708 --> 11:38.963
And then we flew back to Oahu again, and I spent a couple of weeks at the Army hospital on Oahu, and then ended up in Modesto, California for two months at Hammond General Hospital in Modesto.

11:40.529 --> 11:43.053
Again, I go back to the fact that you were 19 years old.

11:43.273 --> 11:46.018
You really took the fast track to war, from high school to war.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.260
Were you scared?

11:48.642 --> 11:50.345
Constantly.

11:50.365 --> 11:55.212
Anybody that didn't combat says they aren't scared, either crazy or lying.

11:55.593 --> 11:56.935
Right.

11:57.185 --> 11:57.586
Indeed.

11:58.787 --> 12:01.311
We've got some photographs that we're going to show you.

12:01.351 --> 12:11.466
A vast amount of photographs that you have that we've chosen a few of them from your war time and pretty fascinating that I want to go ahead and go to and we're going to put them up on the screen.

12:11.486 --> 12:14.610
And there you are, about quite a handsome soldier there.

12:15.191 --> 12:16.373
How old were you when that was taken?

12:16.393 --> 12:18.195
I was still 18 when that was taken.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.738
That was during basic training.

12:19.758 --> 12:24.444
18 years old, fresh out of high school and on your way.

12:25.186 --> 12:26.888
Green as a gourd.

12:27.155 --> 12:28.236
Now, this is you and your brother.

12:28.276 --> 12:29.157
Your brother's on the left.

12:29.197 --> 12:29.778
Talk about him.

12:32.522 --> 12:35.966
He was in the Navy Air Corps on the aircraft carrier Princeton.

12:37.488 --> 12:42.193
And I always thought it was an irony that he survived the sinking of the Princeton.

12:42.213 --> 12:42.434
Yes.

12:42.754 --> 12:44.636
In the Leyte Gulf, right?

12:44.736 --> 12:45.598
In the Leyte Gulf.

12:45.618 --> 12:45.818
Yes.

12:46.298 --> 12:49.222
And then later died in a car wreck in Arizona.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.306
And what was his name?

12:52.666 --> 12:53.107
Gilbert.

12:53.227 --> 12:54.208
Gilbert.

12:54.526 --> 12:56.508
We use this just because of the irony.

12:56.528 --> 13:03.974
I think people that have been reading the news just heard last week that Western Union has stopped sending telegrams after so many years.

13:04.014 --> 13:05.816
So we wanted to put this up.

13:05.856 --> 13:08.258
Talk about this Western Union telegram, who it was to.

13:08.919 --> 13:12.502
That was the telegram that was sent to my mother telling her that I'd been wounded.

13:14.784 --> 13:15.865
I think people can read that.

13:16.065 --> 13:24.212
It says, Secretary Ward desires me to express his deep regret that your son, private

13:24.715 --> 13:33.066
Holly Rees, was slightly wounded on Okinawa 21st June 1945, continued to address mail to him, etc.

13:33.847 --> 13:42.699
So obviously that's the kind of telegram that no mother wants to get, but obviously preferable to the other kind that a lot of people were getting.

13:43.099 --> 13:48.687
Ironically, I had already called her on the telephone and she knew all about it before the telegram.

13:49.388 --> 13:54.334
So the youngsters out there that don't know what we mean by Western Union telegrams, that is...

13:54.820 --> 13:56.301
Actual Western Union telegram.

13:56.682 --> 13:58.584
There it is.

13:58.604 --> 13:59.064
Let's go on.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.867
This is taken from a book that you gave to me.

14:01.907 --> 14:07.152
This sort of gives an idea of what the landing at Okinawa looked like.

14:08.493 --> 14:15.860
You can see looking off in the distance the vast number of ships, and this was just a fraction of what there actually were.

14:17.802 --> 14:18.743
It's quite muddy, wasn't it?

14:20.124 --> 14:24.388
We had lots of rain during the spring in Okinawa.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.425
which made the tanks and artillery a problem.

14:30.445 --> 14:34.350
We're going to talk later on in the show about Holly Rees, the bicycle rider.

14:34.631 --> 14:36.533
And this is some of your early beginnings of it.

14:36.573 --> 14:38.415
Talk about where was this taken?

14:38.435 --> 14:40.478
You're the third one in line there from the front.

14:41.039 --> 14:41.860
Where was this taken?

14:41.920 --> 14:44.843
It was in Breckenridge Park in San Antonio, Texas.

14:44.984 --> 14:45.484
Is that right?

14:45.524 --> 14:46.205
Okay.

14:46.225 --> 14:49.449
So this was after you had finished and you were assigned at Fort Sam Houston.

14:49.469 --> 14:49.649
Right.

14:50.531 --> 14:52.213
I know Breckenridge Park very, very well.

14:52.253 --> 14:54.055
As a matter of fact, I played golf there.

14:54.473 --> 14:56.697
This is just fascinating.

14:56.717 --> 14:58.400
I'm going to let you go ahead and tell the story.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.903
We're going to leave that up on the screen.

15:00.684 --> 15:04.391
And this is a flag, obviously, and I want you to take it from there.

15:04.591 --> 15:05.874
What are we looking at?

15:05.974 --> 15:10.702
Each individual Japanese soldier had their own personal flag.

15:11.944 --> 15:15.030
And I've never had this translated, but it's my understanding.

15:15.837 --> 15:24.390
that the inscriptions around there are sort of a service record that tells where they were and what they did and so forth.

15:24.490 --> 15:30.299
And they carried these in their helmet on top of their head to keep them dry and clean.

15:30.359 --> 15:41.756
And this particular one I shot in the head and the holes in there, if I'd have known you had that good a flag, I'd have aimed a little bit lower and not spoiled the flag.

15:41.796 --> 15:44.460
But this is one of my most prized

15:45.098 --> 15:57.158
So the writing around the outside, we think it's just sort of their itinerary or sort of where they served, where they were and where they served that they wrote on their flag.

15:58.260 --> 16:08.777
And this particular enemy holding this, keeping it in his helmet so that it would stay dry and thus the two bullet holes in the middle.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.346
there's some more holes farther around the perimeter too.

16:12.406 --> 16:17.331
Right, and there are some blood stains on it also that it's hard to see in that picture.

16:18.613 --> 16:19.814
Maybe even a few brines.

16:20.335 --> 16:28.704
Right, I wanted to go ahead and put that picture up, but also show you that we have it right here in the studio, as a matter of fact.

16:29.325 --> 16:30.186
Made out of silk.

16:30.506 --> 16:36.012
Made out of silk, again, so that it would stay safe from the elements.

16:36.753 --> 16:38.595
But I've got to tell you,

16:39.250 --> 16:47.532
Sergeant Rees, I've had a lot of artifacts on this show, but I think this is probably the most amazing World War II artifact I've ever held in my hand.

16:47.552 --> 16:50.199
Just absolutely amazing.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.522
It's something that I know

16:53.054 --> 16:55.377
Brings back some memories, doesn't it?

16:55.397 --> 16:55.998
Sure it does.

16:56.018 --> 16:56.899
Indeed it was.

16:56.919 --> 17:05.390
While we're looking here at this camera of Sergeant Rees and I, as a matter of fact, let's go ahead and look at some of the other things that Sergeant Rees has brought.

17:06.231 --> 17:09.916
This is a hand grenade, right?

17:09.936 --> 17:12.900
That's a genuine hand grenade.

17:13.080 --> 17:16.885
And you said that people really don't take the pin out with their teeth.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.424
That's just something that John Wayne does, right?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.671
It takes a pretty good pull on that ring.

17:22.911 --> 17:26.639
Yeah, because you'd be taking some teeth away.

17:26.659 --> 17:31.870
We'll go ahead and stay on that shot, and I'll just put this right up next to the...

17:32.305 --> 17:33.207
to the grenade there.

17:33.247 --> 17:34.929
What are we looking at there?

17:35.050 --> 17:37.714
That's a 50 caliber bullet.

17:37.734 --> 17:43.464
And the reason that that has significance to me is that we've all heard of friendly fire.

17:43.784 --> 17:44.045
Right.

17:44.305 --> 17:46.850
Unfriendly fire is when it's the enemy.

17:46.870 --> 17:48.853
Friendly fire is when you're shooting yourselves.

17:49.013 --> 17:49.254
Right.

17:49.795 --> 17:52.980
And we had called on the Marine Air Corps for

17:53.450 --> 18:04.455
strafing mission and the pilot hit his trigger just a little bit too soon and we were strafed with 50 caliber bullets

18:04.773 --> 18:10.801
And they killed the artillery spotter that was as close to me as you are.

18:10.822 --> 18:13.846
He took two of those, just almost cut him in two.

18:14.286 --> 18:14.587
Right.

18:15.788 --> 18:17.110
Incredible.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.233
This, any military man knows what this is.

18:19.253 --> 18:21.416
This is, I accidentally just called it a shovel.

18:21.577 --> 18:23.920
It's an entrenching tool though, right?

18:23.940 --> 18:26.363
That's the second most important thing we carried.

18:27.104 --> 18:30.409
A rifle was number one and that was number two.

18:30.659 --> 18:34.025
You put it this way to chop down.

18:34.386 --> 18:34.947
As a pick.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.329
As a pick.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.894
And then as a shovel, you just put it straight out like that.

18:39.835 --> 18:41.218
And this was yours, right?

18:41.238 --> 18:43.522
This is the one that you... It's certainly in good shape.

18:44.363 --> 18:45.826
Certainly in good condition.

18:45.846 --> 18:47.810
That's not the one I had on Okinawa.

18:47.870 --> 18:48.651
Not the one.

18:48.671 --> 18:49.733
No, no.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.895
Now you've got two...

18:52.124 --> 18:53.287
Talk about what we're looking at here.

18:53.307 --> 18:53.968
You got two.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.413
This is a Japanese bayonet.

18:56.634 --> 18:57.596
Bayonet.

18:57.616 --> 19:01.745
And this is a United States World War I. Wait, let me hold that.

19:02.086 --> 19:02.667
So right here.

19:02.888 --> 19:03.429
Bayonet.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.150
Okay.

19:06.135 --> 19:06.696
This is Japanese.

19:06.716 --> 19:08.580
Tell me how you came by this.

19:09.505 --> 19:12.929
The guy that had it didn't need it anymore, so I borrowed it.

19:13.189 --> 19:20.597
The only major difference is the Japanese put a hook on theirs, and our bayonets were 10 inch.

19:20.617 --> 19:27.304
This is a 16 that they used to use, and then they decided that a shorter bayonet was more effective.

19:27.324 --> 19:30.047
And the World War I bayonet, how did you come by that?

19:30.187 --> 19:32.810
I can't remember where I got that.

19:32.910 --> 19:33.711
Right.

19:33.731 --> 19:34.872
I want to...

19:35.408 --> 19:38.235
Excuse me, I want to hold up one more thing here.

19:38.255 --> 19:40.641
I'll hold it up for this same camera so we can look.

19:41.102 --> 19:45.172
This is a shadow box of your awards.

19:45.192 --> 19:49.403
And I'll just hold it right here so the camera can get in on it.

19:49.423 --> 19:49.924
And...

19:50.647 --> 19:52.870
I've got some wonderful awards there.

19:53.471 --> 19:55.294
I've got a list here, as a matter of fact.

19:55.715 --> 19:56.335
They will talk.

19:56.376 --> 19:59.520
Sergeant Rees was awarded, of course, the Purple Heart.

19:59.540 --> 20:03.186
You can see the Purple Heart there on the second from the left.

20:03.206 --> 20:04.528
Also, the Bronze Star Medal.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.030
I guess that's on the far left, right?

20:06.290 --> 20:06.851
Yes.

20:06.871 --> 20:07.773
And then the Purple Heart.

20:07.953 --> 20:10.236
Then next to that, the Good Conduct Medal.

20:10.256 --> 20:13.161
The Asiatic Pacific Theater Medal.

20:13.761 --> 20:15.664
I'm sort of moving from left to right here, I believe.

20:15.704 --> 20:16.806
The American Theater Medal.

20:17.275 --> 20:26.773
the World War II victory medal and the sharpshooter's medal with the suspended bars for rifle, carbine, machine gun, and pistol.

20:26.793 --> 20:32.263
Also, the patches, I guess, down below the 7th Infantry Division,

20:32.969 --> 20:34.792
That's the hourglass division, right?

20:34.812 --> 20:38.236
That was the patch of your seventh edition that you have on your uniform now.

20:38.457 --> 20:41.901
We're going to mention that in a minute, that you still fit in this uniform very good.

20:42.302 --> 20:46.287
The 24th Army Corps patch is the second one from the left.

20:46.528 --> 20:51.394
The 10th Army is the other hourglass-looking patch.

20:51.414 --> 20:56.982
And then Pacific Ocean areas, the blue patch.

20:57.022 --> 20:57.883
Those are quite handsome.

20:57.903 --> 21:01.288
And then up top, I guess those are insignias.

21:01.808 --> 21:16.122
the regiment crest of the 184th and the distinguished unit citation, the combat infantry badge that's in the middle, the identification tag and the crossed rifles.

21:18.484 --> 21:20.486
That's an ornament I guess you wore on your collar, right?

21:20.586 --> 21:22.688
On the far right.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.650
So I know you're very, very proud of these.

21:26.091 --> 21:26.612
Yes.

21:26.632 --> 21:26.932
Indeed.

21:28.173 --> 21:31.056
After you, we'll go ahead and put that back in there.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.443
Oh, and your dog tags.

21:32.784 --> 21:33.485
There's the dog tags.

21:33.785 --> 21:35.027
Don't forget the dog tags.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.750
Those never left you, right?

21:36.790 --> 21:38.372
We carry those around our neck.

21:38.733 --> 21:46.364
The actual dog tag was plain metal, but they rattled, so we put the rubber around it to keep them quiet.

21:47.225 --> 21:51.592
And another interesting thing I didn't tell you the other day is there's a can opener.

21:52.613 --> 21:55.137
Oh, right here in the middle.

21:55.117 --> 21:58.523
That didn't look like much of a can opener, but when you're hungry... But it would do the trick.

21:58.543 --> 22:00.166
When you're hungry, it was a great can opener, right?

22:00.186 --> 22:01.489
That opened the can opener.

22:02.170 --> 22:02.371
Yes.

22:03.653 --> 22:04.314
You were wounded.

22:04.354 --> 22:05.637
You recovered.

22:05.937 --> 22:08.502
As a matter of... They almost wanted to...

22:08.735 --> 22:34.388
amputate the front part of your foot but if you had not been awake they might have done that and you you protested that right they asked me to sign a release and i wouldn't do it so they they left and turned out that was the best thing to do right i want to sort of fast forward you moved on to uh fort sam houston you uh you finished your service and then uh back as a civilian again you uh you met betty betty was from mississippi

22:34.739 --> 22:36.241
And you were from Arizona.

22:36.302 --> 22:37.463
You didn't want to go to Mississippi.

22:37.484 --> 22:38.625
She didn't want to go to Arizona.

22:38.645 --> 22:40.088
So you all settled in Dallas, right?

22:40.148 --> 22:40.689
That's right.

22:41.911 --> 22:47.460
And then while we were living in Dallas, I went to work for the Social Security Administration.

22:48.482 --> 22:53.690
They sent us first to Tyler, then to Longview, then to San Angelo, then to Austin.

22:54.532 --> 22:58.158
And finally, we ended up in Bryan in May of 1957.

22:58.298 --> 23:00.882
Been here ever since.

23:00.862 --> 23:01.423
That's right.

23:01.724 --> 23:07.636
I think you said you worked for Firestone initially when you went to Dallas, but then got with the Social Security Administration.

23:07.656 --> 23:12.486
And you were in charge of the Bryan office for quite a while until you retired in 1984.

23:12.526 --> 23:18.178
I was district manager here for 27 years until I retired in 1984.

23:19.762 --> 23:20.944
You still fit in that uniform.

23:20.964 --> 23:26.671
I don't think there's a whole lot of folks that can say that they still fit in their World War II uniform, but I know you're proud of that part, too.

23:27.192 --> 23:32.239
It's always interesting to me that nobody ever mentions Bronze Star, Purple Heart.

23:33.060 --> 23:37.005
All I'm concerned about is I can still wear them.

23:37.025 --> 23:39.228
Well, I'm glad I was able to mention all of those things.

23:39.248 --> 23:43.995
But it's amazing that it even exists after 60 years.

23:44.556 --> 23:49.262
This is the uniform that I was discharged in 1946.

23:50.120 --> 23:59.450
Sergeant Rees, we've got about three minutes left, and I want to spend that three minutes talking about a whole different aspect of your life, and that is 25 years ago you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

23:59.470 --> 24:05.016
You didn't want to get the insulin shots, so you told your doctor that you were going to replace the shots with diet and exercise.

24:05.036 --> 24:09.901
You've been strict on that diet for 25 years, and you are a bike rider.

24:10.702 --> 24:13.225
Tell them what happened this past January the 4th.

24:13.508 --> 24:20.146
Because I was shot in the foot, I couldn't run and jog, but I could sit down and ride a bike.

24:20.988 --> 24:28.969
So on January the 4th, I finished 50,000 miles over the last 25 years.

24:28.949 --> 24:33.034
I've averaged 2,000 miles a year for 25 years.

24:34.316 --> 24:41.905
As a matter of fact, I ride right by the front of the KAMU studios about four or five days a week.

24:42.166 --> 24:42.586
That's right.

24:42.666 --> 24:51.818
It's about a 12-mile route, right, from your home, which is just not far off the campus, off of university, that you ride on the campus, you ride through campus.

24:52.355 --> 24:56.742
out towards the George Bush library and then back to research park and back home.

24:56.782 --> 24:57.984
It's about a 12 mile route.

24:58.424 --> 25:00.928
And you do this pretty religiously four to five times a week.

25:02.951 --> 25:07.719
It takes about 52 minutes to make the 12 mile run.

25:08.420 --> 25:16.392
Now I know that we were talking the other day and you said that if they gave purple hearts for bike riding, you'd earned a whole, a few more purple hearts than just the one that you've got.

25:16.472 --> 25:21.079
Then in 50,000 miles, I can't imagine that you hadn't hit the ground a couple of times.

25:21.143 --> 25:24.288
Well, number one, I'm on my fifth bicycle.

25:24.308 --> 25:29.257
I usually get about 12,000, 13,000 miles to a bike before I wear them out.

25:30.018 --> 25:32.603
And I've had numerous accidents.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.247
You haven't broken a bone, though.

25:36.089 --> 25:37.672
You've left some skin on the highway, though.

25:37.932 --> 25:38.854
Never had a stitch.

25:39.074 --> 25:40.096
Never had a stitch.

25:40.437 --> 25:45.345
And you're still riding the bike four to five days a week, about 12 miles at a go.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.794
Absolutely tremendous.

25:47.195 --> 25:48.016
Talk about your family.

25:48.036 --> 25:52.485
We've talked about your wife, Betty, but I know that you have kids and grandkids and great grandkids, right?

25:52.505 --> 26:08.093
I have a son in Florida who's both a bachelor and a master's from A&M, and our oldest daughter lives in Albuquerque, and our youngest daughter lives in Alexandria, Louisiana.

26:08.967 --> 26:16.156
And between the three of them, they have our five grandchildren, four grandsons and one granddaughter.

26:17.818 --> 26:22.003
And our oldest grandson has two children.

26:22.023 --> 26:25.287
So we have two great granddaughters that live in Dallas.

26:26.688 --> 26:29.512
So we're quite proud of our family.

26:29.532 --> 26:31.514
They're our greatest blessing.

26:31.915 --> 26:32.776
Indeed they are.

26:32.796 --> 26:36.240
And I know you're also very active in the Rotary here in town.

26:36.625 --> 26:43.376
and very active, and you look great, and you're in your uniform, and I want to thank you very much for your service and telling us your story today.

26:43.396 --> 26:44.959
We're proud to have you in the Brazos Valley.

26:45.620 --> 26:45.821
Thank you.

26:45.841 --> 26:46.261
All right.

26:46.281 --> 26:48.185
Thank you, Sergeant Holly Rees.

26:48.205 --> 26:57.300
As you can see, that bullet to the foot 61 years ago did not stop Holly Rees then, and some 80 birthday celebrations haven't slowed in much either.

26:57.955 --> 27:04.564
He's well into the equivalent of yet another bike ride around the world, and I'm betting that he'll be around to celebrate that too.

27:04.584 --> 27:08.689
We salute Sergeant Holly Rees for his service, and we thank all veterans.

27:08.709 --> 27:11.172
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:11.192 --> 27:16.860
And be sure to read more stories of veterans in the Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.203
For Sergeant Holly Rees, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:19.503 --> 27:21.786
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
