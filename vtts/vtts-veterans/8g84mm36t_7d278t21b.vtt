00:07.118 --> 00:31.307
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.327 --> 00:32.468
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.528 --> 00:39.268
There is a common thread among veterans that runs particularly through those that we call the greatest generations.

00:40.244 --> 00:46.792
Following their brave service to our country came a long career of labor, supporting their families, earning their retirement.

00:46.812 --> 00:52.680
Well, for 25 years, Brian's Raymond Schultz was a plumber at Texas A&M until his retirement in 1985.

00:53.841 --> 01:05.356
But today we salute those years of his youth when as a member of the 547th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapon Battalion, he found himself on the final march through Europe.

01:05.376 --> 01:08.580
Attached to and following behind General George S. Patton,

01:09.117 --> 01:18.709
Yes, whether it was the movies or the old newsreels, we all are familiar with Patton's blood and gut speeches to his troops as he led the Third Army in that final push.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.874
Well, Sergeant Raymond Schultz was there listening.

01:22.894 --> 01:29.703
It's just one of his memories of his nearly four years of service in the United States Army, and it's a pleasure to have him today.

01:30.043 --> 01:31.365
Sergeant Schultz, welcome.

01:31.765 --> 01:33.728
And let's just go from the very start.

01:33.768 --> 01:34.669
You're a young man.

01:35.020 --> 02:01.281
out of Brenham Texas and all of a sudden you're in the army now and you find yourself in California that's where you did your training you were stateside for about two and a half years talk about what you did in California first well I went over there and when I got there for about a month or two they made me corporal then about another month later they made me sergeant and I was a sergeant

02:02.375 --> 02:03.577
drill sergeant, you know.

02:03.977 --> 02:11.887
And I had to drill the guys for infantry drill and bayonet practice and all that.

02:11.947 --> 02:21.580
We had to go out to the firing range and fire our guns out there.

02:21.600 --> 02:27.087
I told targets that we had to go out there and shoot at them all the time.

02:27.848 --> 02:31.152
So we was out there in the hot heat.

02:31.172 --> 02:31.673
Yes, sir.

02:32.159 --> 02:34.143
Wasn't but about 120 degrees.

02:35.386 --> 02:36.428
We're a little bit used to that here.

02:36.929 --> 02:38.913
These were pretty raw recruits, though, right?

02:38.953 --> 02:42.640
I mean, these were raw guys that didn't know a whole lot about what you were teaching them.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.622
Oh, yeah.

02:44.284 --> 02:45.847
You had to teach them a lot, right?

02:45.867 --> 02:46.147
Oh, yeah.

02:46.328 --> 02:48.392
They come from the eastern states, you know.

02:49.354 --> 02:53.863
And when I got through training them, while we got on a trip,

02:54.468 --> 03:04.523
got on a train in California over there, and went all the way straight across the United States to New York.

03:05.424 --> 03:09.430
And that's where you headed to Europe.

03:09.811 --> 03:10.732
Talk a little bit about the ship.

03:10.793 --> 03:14.138
Later on, we're going to see a picture of the boat, but that's kind of an interesting story.

03:14.158 --> 03:20.327
I think it was an ocean liner that had been turned into a transport vessel for the troops.

03:20.707 --> 03:23.091
Talk about the ship that you went over across on.

03:23.746 --> 03:35.900
Well, when we went across from New York to England, well, it took us six days and six nights.

03:36.861 --> 03:37.382
Got on.

03:38.122 --> 03:42.227
And all at once, we got about halfway across.

03:42.688 --> 03:49.215
Then we had an order came out that the Germans sunk the British Martina.

03:49.776 --> 03:52.639
And what happened, it was a tanker that they sunk.

03:53.345 --> 03:55.348
We weren't bothered with it.

03:55.709 --> 04:03.220
You weren't, because the ship that you were on was actually the RMS Mauritania, and this was a ship that, it was an English vessel, right?

04:03.240 --> 04:05.744
It had been built by the... Yeah, they built it.

04:05.804 --> 04:07.667
The English built that ship.

04:07.687 --> 04:08.067
Right.

04:08.087 --> 04:12.514
And then in the year 1967, they demolished it.

04:14.377 --> 04:15.939
That was the end of the ship.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.905
But it was a cruise vessel, I believe, before it served in the war.

04:19.965 --> 04:21.327
Then it served in the war by...

04:21.492 --> 04:24.215
transporting troops and then it went back to being a cruise vessel.

04:24.235 --> 04:29.800
I think we had 14,000 aboard that ship when I was on it.

04:29.820 --> 04:30.120
Indeed.

04:31.221 --> 04:41.051
So you land in London and you're a member of the 347th Battalion and you find yourself attached, I believe, to the 3rd Army and General Patton's army.

04:41.431 --> 04:47.517
Talk about that experience and your memories of George S. Patton.

04:48.374 --> 04:57.043
We were attached to General Patton, and we went into France and then into Germany.

04:57.724 --> 05:05.351
And then we hit Mets, Germany, and General Patton was running low-walled fuel.

05:06.633 --> 05:12.359
And he said, one of them guys are coming with that fuel.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.740
He said, I'm about to run out.

05:14.243 --> 05:19.508
And he finally stopped and got out on top of that ship.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.190
I mean, on top of the tank.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.111
And he was looking around.

05:25.072 --> 05:28.435
Oh, here they all come with that fuel.

05:29.036 --> 05:32.218
And when they did come, boy, he really got on them, I tell you.

05:32.238 --> 05:35.481
He said, y'all are going to run me out of fuel all the way out.

05:35.882 --> 05:38.944
So he said, I don't want to be running out of fuel no more.

05:39.845 --> 05:41.567
And so they kept all going.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.288
And that's when we followed him.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.358
all the way across the earth.

05:45.998 --> 05:52.345
I'm trying to, since we talked the other day, I've been trying to picture this, the perception that we have of George Patton.

05:52.846 --> 05:56.310
There was, of course, the famous movie that was made, Patton, with George C. Scott.

05:56.370 --> 05:58.713
We've all seen newsreels and things like that.

06:00.835 --> 06:07.202
What's the perception that we have of Patton, and what kind of a guy was he?

06:07.222 --> 06:10.726
He's perceived as a pretty rough commander.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.668
Oh, he was rough.

06:13.154 --> 06:18.702
He was good, because whenever he said something he wanted done, he got it done.

06:20.264 --> 06:24.790
Yeah, he was a rough man, I'll tell you, but he was good.

06:24.810 --> 06:28.636
He did everything he said while he got it done.

06:28.976 --> 06:41.393
So your battalion was following, I mean, this was just a march through all of these countries, so you actually had him and his tanks in your sight throughout this entire march, is that right?

06:41.454 --> 06:41.794
Yeah.

06:42.989 --> 06:47.434
We pulled off 50-caliber machine guns.

06:47.734 --> 06:50.458
See, we had those with four guns on it.

06:51.218 --> 06:52.059
Yes, sir.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.501
That's what we used all the time.

06:53.982 --> 06:57.986
And the 40-millimeter and the aircraft gun.

06:58.006 --> 06:59.788
That's the guns we used.

07:00.449 --> 07:07.757
And it was your battalion's job to add support, anti-aircraft support, to Patton's army.

07:07.777 --> 07:08.398
Is that right?

07:09.559 --> 07:09.940
That's right, yeah.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.060
Yeah.

07:11.153 --> 07:13.937
Yeah, I got to give him support.

07:13.957 --> 07:19.064
But I'll tell you, he didn't mess around.

07:19.084 --> 07:27.035
Because every time he'd go quite a ways, then he'd stop, crawl back out of that third tank.

07:27.275 --> 07:28.177
Right.

07:28.197 --> 07:34.445
And he'd stand there and look around and all in one seat was like, let's go.

07:35.387 --> 07:38.491
If y'all got the blood, I got the guts.

07:38.511 --> 07:39.372
Ha, ha, ha.

07:39.824 --> 07:42.226
You remember him standing on that tank and yelling that?

07:42.707 --> 07:43.268
Oh, yeah.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.469
He said all the time.

07:45.190 --> 07:48.413
I talked to him, oh, I don't know how many times I talked to him over there.

07:48.833 --> 07:49.975
You personally talked to him?

07:49.995 --> 07:50.255
Yeah.

07:50.675 --> 07:51.977
He was friendly.

07:53.839 --> 07:56.501
But he got mad at some of them over there.

07:56.521 --> 07:57.502
What did y'all talk about?

07:57.522 --> 08:02.868
I mean, when you talked to him personally, what did you, did you, what kind of things did you talk about?

08:02.908 --> 08:03.529
Can you recall?

08:04.710 --> 08:05.571
I don't even remember.

08:05.591 --> 08:08.734
The only thing we talked about was about the war.

08:09.625 --> 08:12.589
moving on and getting it over with and all that.

08:14.132 --> 08:16.275
Was he interested in his soldiers?

08:16.315 --> 08:25.328
I mean you were a sergeant, he was a general, but did he have a genuine interest in who you were and where you were from and did he take that interest in the individual soldier?

08:25.869 --> 08:27.772
No, he didn't too much.

08:28.974 --> 08:34.502
He just kind of stood for himself.

08:35.663 --> 08:45.156
So the march went through, like you said, it went through France, and it went through Belgium, and eventually you found yourself in the winter of 1944 as part of the Battle of the Bulge.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.238
The Battle of the Bulge.

08:46.258 --> 08:46.899
Very famous battle.

08:46.919 --> 08:47.820
Talk about what you remember.

08:47.860 --> 08:52.026
We went through the Battle of the Bulge, then the war ended.

08:52.466 --> 08:52.767
Right.

08:52.787 --> 09:00.517
And that's when we went into Holland, and that's where we separated.

09:00.537 --> 09:03.882
And all, when we were coming into Holland,

09:04.570 --> 09:06.133
to battle the bulls down there.

09:06.774 --> 09:08.937
All them young Germans gave up to us.

09:09.578 --> 09:17.231
They come out of the woods with them handkerchiefs in their heads and a wave and then we was bringing them in.

09:17.251 --> 09:26.427
We put them in a truck and took them to the prison camp and when after the war was over, we turned them all loose again.

09:26.710 --> 09:30.735
What kind of soldiers were the Germans that were surrendering to you?

09:30.835 --> 09:34.320
I mean, they knew that they were beat.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.601
Oh, yeah.

09:35.621 --> 09:37.283
Talk a little bit more about that.

09:37.844 --> 09:38.765
They were young ones.

09:39.586 --> 09:45.574
And a lot of them, I talked to them and they said, we never even had no guns ever.

09:45.754 --> 09:47.676
Never used no guns.

09:47.696 --> 09:48.858
And they was fighting the war.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.223
Yeah, I'm telling you, we had it.

09:54.405 --> 09:54.625
But

09:56.647 --> 10:01.192
We took a lot of them to the prison camp, and some of them we marched over there.

10:01.592 --> 10:02.133
Is that right?

10:02.153 --> 10:09.781
Got all lined up, and we walked over there, and come back again, and it was real good.

10:10.141 --> 10:16.488
The Battle of the Bulge, I think a lot of what history books tell us was about the weather, about the Battle of the Bulge.

10:16.588 --> 10:21.333
It was in the winter of 1944, and it was probably about as cold as you've ever been, right?

10:21.353 --> 10:21.793
That's right.

10:22.297 --> 10:30.564
And that country, you know, had big holes in it and all that and full of snow.

10:30.584 --> 10:36.669
And a lot of them soldiers fell out in that hole and they couldn't get out.

10:36.689 --> 10:40.373
And after it was all thawed out, then there they were.

10:41.133 --> 10:44.096
They all really dead and they were frozen.

10:44.116 --> 10:44.496
Right.

10:44.516 --> 10:49.060
And then so it was something, I'll tell you.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.122
How did you stay warm?

10:51.355 --> 10:52.776
Wearing coats and running.

10:54.698 --> 10:55.719
Wearing coats and running.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.642
But that was part of the enemy, was the weather.

10:58.662 --> 11:04.868
I mean, because I know that soldiers suffered from trench foot, from frostbite.

11:05.088 --> 11:10.153
It was a hard thing to battle, was the weather almost as much as the enemy during the Battle of the Bulge, right?

11:10.334 --> 11:11.335
Oh, yeah.

11:11.355 --> 11:11.995
It was rough.

11:12.476 --> 11:13.216
Right.

11:13.236 --> 11:14.998
Yeah, it was rough, I tell you.

11:15.018 --> 11:20.063
I know that, I believe that it was there at the Battle of the Bulge that you...

11:20.515 --> 11:22.658
earned one of your decorations.

11:22.758 --> 11:26.463
I know you earned a medal for fighting in Europe.

11:26.804 --> 11:27.805
Yeah.

11:27.825 --> 11:45.269
And I had seen in your discharge papers that it was the Rheinfeld Central Europe, I believe, which probably had something to do with the Battle of the Bulges is where you had earned that, and also a medal with two bronze stars.

11:45.289 --> 11:45.529
Yeah.

11:46.671 --> 11:47.772
What were the bronze stars for?

11:49.186 --> 11:51.529
Well, that was the battles that we went through.

11:51.870 --> 11:52.030
Right.

11:52.771 --> 11:53.412
Oh, yeah, that's right.

11:53.432 --> 11:58.680
For each battle, you got a bronze star on the medal for the battles that you went through.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.441
Yeah.

11:59.461 --> 11:59.882
Is that right?

12:00.583 --> 12:02.886
You took the prisoners to the prison camps.

12:03.547 --> 12:04.468
Yeah.

12:04.609 --> 12:05.870
Talk more about that.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.514
You were actually driving the trucks where the prisoners were.

12:08.574 --> 12:14.203
What do you recall about those trips and what was said and what the mood was like?

12:14.543 --> 12:15.244
Well...

12:16.540 --> 12:17.982
I didn't stay there too long.

12:18.022 --> 12:22.027
I just unloaded them and took back off again from over there.

12:22.047 --> 12:22.347
Right.

12:22.507 --> 12:25.170
But they were all right.

12:25.971 --> 12:29.255
They didn't act mean and nothing.

12:29.576 --> 12:31.198
They were ready for the war to be over also.

12:31.218 --> 12:31.578
Oh, yeah.

12:31.999 --> 12:36.124
Yeah, the young boys wanted to get out of that deal that he was in.

12:37.385 --> 12:42.832
Heck, some of them wasn't but about 17 years old, and some of them might be maybe 16.

12:43.393 --> 12:46.176
They just might have just come out of school somewhere.

12:46.865 --> 12:48.087
that young.

12:49.048 --> 13:02.926
I think a lot of us focus on our own troops and our own American troops in the war and sometimes we lose sight of the fact that these were young men too in Germany who were fighting for a cause that whether or not it was a just cause or not.

13:02.946 --> 13:07.672
These were young men that wanted to get back to their families just as much as the Americans did too.

13:07.712 --> 13:08.313
That's right.

13:09.514 --> 13:10.495
Yeah, I'll tell you.

13:12.077 --> 13:15.161
We had a lot of young boys.

13:15.882 --> 13:16.483
I know them all.

13:17.712 --> 13:26.039
And when I was talking over there, I was interpreter over, and them Germans come to me and talk to me all the time.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.004
My buddies that are with me, you old crowd got it made over here.

13:33.785 --> 13:40.972
I want to talk about that because after the war was over in Europe, you spent six months in Europe again.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.012
And talk about your job.

13:42.052 --> 13:46.316
You were an interpreter because you were an American soldier who knew German.

13:46.336 --> 13:47.517
First off, let's talk about that.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.165
How did you learn German?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.869
That came as a youth living in the Brenham area, right?

13:51.889 --> 13:52.109
I am.

13:52.470 --> 13:57.156
I talked to my mother all the time in German.

13:57.176 --> 13:59.399
She was, her name was Lakey.

14:00.521 --> 14:04.727
And her kids folks and all that, they were from Germany.

14:04.747 --> 14:06.329
Right.

14:07.230 --> 14:12.998
And I was an interpreter over there and

14:15.458 --> 14:20.084
The more Germans were real good to me.

14:20.184 --> 14:24.329
After the war was over, they'd give you anything you want.

14:25.170 --> 14:31.678
I mean, they even had potatoes down in the cellar of them buildings.

14:33.441 --> 14:36.184
And they said, you get all the potatoes you want.

14:36.204 --> 14:39.628
I went in there one day and got me a bag.

14:40.109 --> 14:43.834
He got in there and was going to get me some potatoes.

14:43.854 --> 14:44.875
And you know what?

14:45.142 --> 14:55.784
They had a mine stuck into them potatoes and covered up, and it was about this high and about this big around.

14:55.804 --> 14:58.309
And I seen that there, and I got out of there.

14:58.329 --> 14:59.191
I said, you know what?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.456
I don't want no water potatoes.

15:01.476 --> 15:02.238
I said, I see it all.

15:02.578 --> 15:05.344
And the same thing happened in the rifle factory.

15:06.016 --> 15:07.418
Me and the buddy went over there.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.325
I said, I want to get me a gun from over here and take it home with me.

15:11.345 --> 15:11.805
Right.

15:11.825 --> 15:18.376
So he went with me over there, and I went out into that little old room.

15:18.396 --> 15:20.460
It looked like an office.

15:20.480 --> 15:27.451
So I looked down there, and they had a cot there and had a spring on it.

15:27.791 --> 15:29.594
And there was something hanging under that thing.

15:30.836 --> 15:31.838
And I went there and looked.

15:32.425 --> 15:38.052
And it was a hand grenade hung on that nail, you know, on that thing.

15:38.453 --> 15:41.637
If you'd pull on, you'd pull the pin out and it'd blow you up.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.221
So I said, I hollered at my buddy.

15:44.241 --> 15:45.022
I said, you know what?

15:45.783 --> 15:46.704
Let's get out of here.

15:46.744 --> 15:48.366
I said, I don't want no guns either.

15:48.827 --> 15:50.829
And we come out of there.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.491
I didn't go in there no more.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.996
And these were things you experienced after the war was over.

15:56.357 --> 15:57.318
Yeah.

15:57.338 --> 15:58.720
Yeah, that was all after the war.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.200
Incredible.

15:59.220 --> 16:02.044
You told me the other day about some...

16:02.446 --> 16:05.711
some schnapps that you got a hold of.

16:05.771 --> 16:08.155
What do you call that?

16:08.375 --> 16:09.096
Catuffel schnapps.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.919
It was made from ice potatoes.

16:11.660 --> 16:12.621
And that's pretty mean stuff.

16:13.022 --> 16:16.447
Oh, I mean, it's just as clear as water.

16:16.467 --> 16:19.572
And them old men, them old people over there said, you know what?

16:20.734 --> 16:24.439
If that stuff don't burn, don't you drink it.

16:24.459 --> 16:26.362
You mean if you set fire to it and it doesn't burn?

16:26.763 --> 16:27.304
Don't drink it.

16:27.364 --> 16:28.726
Oh, it burns just like that.

16:28.826 --> 16:30.208
Then you drink it.

16:30.239 --> 16:37.109
When it burned, he said it's good, but if it don't burn, don't drink it.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.211
And you learned the hard way.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.973
Oh, yeah.

16:41.235 --> 16:54.614
We went to a ball game over there, and some of them Germans were playing ball out there, and me and my buddy were over there, and he took him a bottle along, and I'm telling you, he landed on that back.

16:54.975 --> 16:56.517
He was...

16:56.817 --> 17:00.022
I mean, he was dizzy from that stuff, I tell you.

17:01.043 --> 17:04.148
I drank a little bit of it, but I didn't know much of it.

17:04.168 --> 17:06.011
So you spent six months after the war.

17:06.712 --> 17:13.002
You talked about traveling around in a black car, in the back seat of a black car for six months, traveling around Germany, and it was your job to intern.

17:13.022 --> 17:17.268
I had a Spanish guy that was driving the car for me.

17:18.470 --> 17:23.618
And the guy that was in charge, he was an officer, and

17:25.403 --> 17:35.438
He didn't know one word in German, so I had to go with him all the time and talk for him and talk for him.

17:35.458 --> 17:43.109
And that's why that old German says, I don't see why you learn to speak German so good in America.

17:44.150 --> 17:49.558
I said, well, I went to school over here and thought about Germany, but I didn't.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.723
You were just fooling them there, right?

17:53.363 --> 17:54.465
You had actually learned them

17:54.800 --> 17:56.281
learned it all in Central Texas.

17:56.382 --> 17:57.983
I guess that was kind of hard for them to believe.

17:58.464 --> 17:58.964
Oh, yeah.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.806
Yeah.

18:00.826 --> 18:07.833
Well, when I came back out of service, I took a course as German at Blinn College.

18:07.853 --> 18:08.293
Is that right?

18:08.614 --> 18:11.036
An old guy named Professor Smith.

18:11.617 --> 18:12.778
He was the teacher.

18:14.239 --> 18:15.781
And I made a B+.

18:17.022 --> 18:18.303
Congratulations.

18:18.323 --> 18:21.246
And he said the next

18:22.087 --> 18:25.191
Semester will be the verbs and adverbs.

18:26.512 --> 18:33.201
I said, oh, heck, forget about it.

18:33.221 --> 18:34.903
We want to go now, I think, if we're ready.

18:35.103 --> 18:43.012
You've supplied us with some photographs from your vast album of World War II and some pictures of you back in the mid-40s.

18:43.073 --> 18:44.915
And I think when we have time, we're going to go through them.

18:44.935 --> 18:45.495
And there we go.

18:45.916 --> 18:50.862
You can look right over there on that monitor there, Mr. Schultz, and look at the pictures and tell us a little bit about it.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.165
That's you, I believe, that we're looking at on the right.

18:53.205 --> 18:57.529
Yeah, that's me, and the other one, they call him Booger Red.

18:58.109 --> 18:59.070
He had red hair.

18:59.150 --> 18:59.811
He had red hair.

18:59.831 --> 19:01.072
We always called him Booger Red.

19:01.092 --> 19:02.273
Now, was that taken in California?

19:02.553 --> 19:03.915
Yeah, that was Camp Hon.

19:04.195 --> 19:07.798
Camp Hon, during the Camp Hon, which was near Riverside, California.

19:08.159 --> 19:08.419
Yeah.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.201
Okay.

19:11.402 --> 19:12.763
That was in Camp Hon, too.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.184
I was out there pumping water.

19:18.148 --> 19:18.508
Yeah.

19:18.528 --> 19:19.249
Good-looking soldier.

19:20.050 --> 19:20.410
Oh, yeah.

19:21.638 --> 19:24.842
There's you in the sweater there on the right again.

19:25.243 --> 19:27.365
Is that Booger again?

19:27.385 --> 19:28.326
Or is that somebody else?

19:28.346 --> 19:29.728
That's somebody else.

19:29.748 --> 19:31.030
That's another one of your buddies.

19:31.050 --> 19:31.190
Yeah.

19:31.851 --> 19:35.295
And that again is in your training in California.

19:35.315 --> 19:36.236
Yeah, that's in California.

19:36.557 --> 19:40.402
And Dad's where I took a bath that morning and sat on the outside.

19:41.443 --> 19:42.945
Somebody decided to take a picture of you.

19:43.185 --> 19:43.866
Cooled off.

19:45.787 --> 19:48.672
Now we get, this picture was taken in Belgium.

19:48.732 --> 19:51.236
I think that this picture is very fascinating.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.019
Talk about this photograph.

19:53.039 --> 19:55.543
That was a, what do you call him, his name?

19:55.983 --> 19:58.888
I think it's on the back of that, what his name is.

19:58.928 --> 19:59.709
Okay.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.954
I'll look there.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.397
Fred Wittenberger.

20:04.517 --> 20:04.998
Yeah.

20:05.018 --> 20:06.320
There you go.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.403
That's your friend there on the left, and that's you on the right?

20:08.423 --> 20:09.685
He was a sergeant with me.

20:10.745 --> 20:12.347
And this was taken in Belgium.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.849
This was during your march or just on a day off?

20:14.889 --> 20:17.332
It looked like y'all are enjoying a beverage there outside.

20:17.352 --> 20:19.574
No, we just had a day off over there in Belgium.

20:19.594 --> 20:19.854
Right.

20:20.174 --> 20:20.435
Yeah.

20:20.955 --> 20:22.817
And was this just like a cafe on the street?

20:23.157 --> 20:23.438
Yeah.

20:26.621 --> 20:28.923
Yeah, it was.

20:28.943 --> 20:31.546
It looks like it might have been cold that time when that picture was taken.

20:31.586 --> 20:32.947
Yeah, it was.

20:33.127 --> 20:36.430
Belgium, it was pretty doggone cool all over Europe.

20:36.691 --> 20:37.051
Indeed.

20:37.732 --> 20:38.052
Indeed.

20:38.909 --> 20:44.955
Now, I've got another photograph here that's a bit smaller, and we'll come in on it, and I'll get my fingers out of the way.

20:45.816 --> 20:48.499
That's the German flag.

20:49.380 --> 20:54.946
We was going to take that out to the German house, and they didn't want us to have it.

20:54.966 --> 20:57.869
So we waited until they all left.

20:58.169 --> 21:02.534
We went in there and got it and took a picture of it.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.337
So this was after the war was over?

21:05.557 --> 21:06.518
Yeah.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.680
That's me on that thing over here.

21:09.048 --> 21:09.789
On the far right?

21:10.129 --> 21:11.050
Yeah.

21:11.070 --> 21:11.691
Yeah, that's me.

21:12.232 --> 21:12.792
And that's you.

21:13.133 --> 21:16.817
And so this was, and what became of that flag, do you know?

21:17.578 --> 21:18.098
I don't know.

21:18.199 --> 21:21.863
I think we took it back in the house.

21:22.464 --> 21:22.784
I see.

21:23.044 --> 21:24.606
Yeah, when we used it that time.

21:25.587 --> 21:28.130
So this is sort of a victory picture here.

21:28.150 --> 21:29.111
Yeah.

21:29.131 --> 21:33.757
Well, that's certainly a fascinating photograph from post-war Germany.

21:33.777 --> 21:34.077
Yeah.

21:35.170 --> 21:39.015
Now, the next picture that we're going to show, we're going to get you a chance to talk about Thomas Schultz.

21:39.215 --> 21:39.856
He's your dad.

21:40.838 --> 21:43.221
And we can sort of come up here.

21:43.341 --> 21:44.683
There we go, and I'll get rid of there.

21:45.284 --> 21:46.165
This is Thomas Schultz.

21:46.185 --> 21:47.006
This is your father.

21:47.286 --> 21:49.149
And this is a photograph that was taken of him.

21:49.169 --> 21:52.013
He is a veteran of World War I. Talk about your dad.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.496
He was a wagoneer.

21:56.438 --> 22:04.149
He delivered supplies all over Germany and all that, when that war was at that time.

22:04.169 --> 22:04.369
Uh-huh.

22:04.850 --> 22:05.110
And...

22:08.431 --> 22:20.823
He drove four mules and a wagon, and that's where he hauled all that stuff on during the World War I. Thomas Schultz.

22:22.064 --> 22:25.388
Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S-H, Thomas Schultz.

22:25.468 --> 22:28.451
Now, how old were you when he passed away?

22:28.471 --> 22:29.011
Do you recall?

22:31.133 --> 22:35.177
He was in the 70s when he passed away.

22:35.398 --> 22:35.738
Right.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.287
Yeah, he was in the 70s.

22:40.268 --> 22:41.709
Got one more photograph that I want to show.

22:41.749 --> 22:43.050
It's a little bit larger photograph.

22:43.090 --> 22:49.295
We talked about the vessel that you came over on from New York to London.

22:49.756 --> 22:51.157
And here's a sketch that you have.

22:51.217 --> 22:52.979
This picture hangs in your home.

22:53.659 --> 22:56.262
Yeah.

22:56.342 --> 23:05.910
As a nurse that went over to Germany, went on that same ship I did,

23:06.194 --> 23:07.255
And I didn't know it.

23:08.477 --> 23:11.821
And now she belongs to the VFW over here.

23:12.422 --> 23:15.887
And she was always talking about that British Martini.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.729
I said, well, that's the ship I was on.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.231
She said, I was too.

23:19.912 --> 23:23.737
She was a nurse, you know, over in Germany during the war.

23:24.238 --> 23:24.959
On the same ship.

23:25.279 --> 23:25.880
Same ship.

23:26.381 --> 23:29.144
And then one guy said, where did you ride on that thing?

23:29.485 --> 23:31.768
I said, right in the front on that tip.

23:32.088 --> 23:33.450
That's where I was sitting.

23:34.595 --> 23:41.524
And that lady is now with the VFW here in Bryan College Station?

23:41.544 --> 23:44.348
Yeah, she's a member over there.

23:44.368 --> 23:45.609
Small world, even in the war.

23:45.709 --> 23:47.412
And she's the one who got me that picture.

23:47.892 --> 23:48.493
Is that right?

23:48.513 --> 23:48.733
Yeah.

23:49.775 --> 23:51.016
She's the one who got me that picture.

23:51.056 --> 23:53.539
She said, I'm going to get you a picture of that ship.

23:53.559 --> 23:54.821
She said, I got one of them.

23:54.841 --> 23:55.742
I took it.

23:55.762 --> 23:57.344
I said, well, I never did take one.

23:57.364 --> 23:59.027
So she got me one.

24:00.368 --> 24:01.750
And that's something that you're very proud of.

24:01.865 --> 24:02.606
Oh, yeah.

24:03.306 --> 24:07.451
Yeah, I took it home and put it in the frame and hung it on the wall.

24:08.792 --> 24:12.316
And I walk in that room while I look at my ship.

24:13.737 --> 24:19.283
You were in the service for just under four years, and then you came back to the United States, and you were a plumber.

24:19.303 --> 24:26.951
You were a plumber in Brenham and also at Bryan Field at the Air Force Base, but then they closed that down, and you went to work at Texas A&M.

24:26.971 --> 24:27.171
Yeah.

24:27.451 --> 24:29.273
Talk about your career after the service.

24:29.928 --> 24:38.339
Well, I came home and I did plumbing work over there for Haveron Plumbing Company.

24:39.661 --> 24:42.464
And then I worked to another guy.

24:42.925 --> 24:45.749
And then I came over here to Bryan's Hill.

24:46.189 --> 24:51.236
That four of us drove back and forth every day from Brenham to here.

24:52.357 --> 24:55.041
And that was from 52 to 58.

24:55.780 --> 25:14.582
And then they closed it down, and one of my bosses over there, he came over here to Brian's A&M, and he called me about two weeks later or so, and he asked and said, Raymond, do you want to go?

25:15.305 --> 25:16.707
to work over at A&M?

25:16.947 --> 25:19.410
I said, yeah, when can I go to work?

25:19.430 --> 25:20.711
He said, anytime you want to.

25:20.731 --> 25:22.093
I said, I'll see you Monday.

25:22.534 --> 25:24.316
So I went to work over there.

25:24.336 --> 25:27.039
And 25 years later, you retired, and that was five years ago.

25:27.439 --> 25:28.921
Yeah.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.303
That's 20 years ago.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.424
Right, 20 years ago.

25:31.584 --> 25:32.005
Exactly.

25:32.025 --> 25:32.926
Yeah, that you retired.

25:33.106 --> 25:33.947
Yeah.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.669
That was in 1985, of course.

25:35.990 --> 25:36.250
Yes.

25:36.787 --> 25:41.752
You are a proud member of the Veteran of Foreign Wars host here in Bryan College Station.

25:41.772 --> 25:49.801
And I know that your wife, Odell, who you lost some four years ago, she was president of the auxiliary over there for, what, 15 years?

25:50.102 --> 25:52.504
Yeah, she was a lady of the auxiliary president.

25:52.524 --> 25:52.925
Right.

25:52.945 --> 25:55.367
She kept all the books and stuff, and she baked.

25:56.969 --> 25:58.551
Greatest pie maker ever.

25:58.731 --> 26:01.314
She had the kitchen.

26:01.334 --> 26:06.760
And when they had bingo over there, well, she baked pies at home, sometimes.

26:06.959 --> 26:16.570
eight and ten big pies and we'd take them along over there and put them in the kitchen and then people got so used to them big pies.

26:16.871 --> 26:20.275
There's chocolate pies, coconut pies, lemon pies.

26:20.555 --> 26:21.276
Every kind of pie.

26:21.416 --> 26:22.817
Yeah, all kinds.

26:23.719 --> 26:26.942
And right now they're still talking about it.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.065
We sure miss your wife.

26:29.125 --> 26:29.305
We're

26:29.622 --> 26:32.066
They just all have pies and stuff over here.

26:32.086 --> 26:32.888
I bet they do.

26:32.908 --> 26:33.589
We're out of time.

26:33.890 --> 26:36.394
Thank you for your service, Sergeant Schultz.

26:36.414 --> 26:47.234
Born and raised in Brenham 85 years ago, Raymond Schultz returned there in time for Christmas of 1945, started his plumbing career and making new memories with his wife, Odell, and their family.

26:47.254 --> 26:51.141
And like most veterans, his memory of his service hardly fades at all.

26:51.121 --> 26:53.984
It was a proud time, and we remain proud of all of them.

26:54.004 --> 26:57.387
We salute Sergeant Raymond Schultz for his service and all veterans.

26:57.447 --> 27:01.972
Please thank a veteran today, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:01.992 --> 27:03.093
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:03.113 --> 27:17.567
See you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
