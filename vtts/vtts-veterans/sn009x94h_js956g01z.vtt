00:14.543 --> 00:37.987
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.488 --> 00:39.589
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:41.138 --> 00:54.425
On that Sunday, December the 7th, 1941, A&M sophomore Louis Hudson sat in the campus theater across from Texas A&M when the theater manager stopped the film, came out to tell his patrons about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.

00:54.445 --> 00:58.894
The event that changed the course of America also changed the lives of Americans.

00:59.178 --> 01:14.165
For Lewis Hudson, it started his path to the Army, to paratroop school at Fort Benning, to England, where he joined up with the 82nd Airborne, to a midnight jump behind the German lines that guarded Utah Beach just hours before the Allies' invasion at Normandy.

01:14.185 --> 01:14.927
It was D-Day.

01:15.468 --> 01:17.231
Day in and day out, there was combat.

01:17.371 --> 01:20.697
Eventually, another jump called Operation Market Garden.

01:21.278 --> 01:22.300
And then the Battle of the Bulge.

01:22.988 --> 01:26.974
Lewis Hudson and his wife, Jo, have been married nearly 59 years now.

01:26.994 --> 01:28.295
They live in Bryan.

01:28.315 --> 01:31.620
He certainly has a story of service to tell.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.583
Lewis Hudson, thank you for joining us.

01:33.603 --> 01:40.412
I want to go back to Texas A&M and sort of the environment here on campus back after Pearl Harbor was attacked.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.075
What was it like?

01:42.115 --> 01:47.242
What were the thoughts back then of the students and sort of the community back then?

01:47.262 --> 01:50.346
Well, Tom, I think everybody knows that it was...

01:51.068 --> 01:52.551
All Corps then.

01:52.811 --> 02:02.748
We were under Army regulations, even though we were in the Army Reserve ROTC program.

02:03.529 --> 02:06.174
But it was very strict.

02:06.194 --> 02:10.481
We had classes until 12 noon on Saturdays.

02:11.323 --> 02:14.308
And unless you got a pass to leave, we were...

02:14.660 --> 02:17.023
busy on the campus.

02:17.063 --> 02:18.044
We went to movies.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.948
They expected us to go to church in those days.

02:21.889 --> 02:23.631
And we did sometimes.

02:25.173 --> 02:39.970
But we were aware of the war situations in Europe and in Asia and thinking, almost everybody thinking that someday we too might be involved.

02:41.472 --> 02:43.755
Although public opinion

02:44.174 --> 02:53.383
was very much opposed in the United States to getting involved with either side of the conflict until Pearl Harbor.

02:53.523 --> 02:54.103
Right.

02:54.123 --> 02:59.308
Later you would go back to the movie and you would see one of the old newsreels and it would talk about the paratroopers at Fort Benning.

02:59.889 --> 03:01.350
And that's sort of where you got hooked.

03:01.370 --> 03:03.572
That's what you wanted to do, right?

03:03.592 --> 03:12.240
Yeah, my roommate and I went to the movie one Sunday afternoon and they had then, I don't think we see it so much now,

03:12.507 --> 03:14.710
But they had little short subjects.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.232
Sometimes they were comedies.

03:16.412 --> 03:19.776
Then we had newsreels and things like that before the main feature.

03:20.718 --> 03:23.541
And we saw one called Fort Benning Paratroopers.

03:23.802 --> 03:26.765
And it was very interesting to me.

03:27.546 --> 03:31.552
I told my roommate, that's something I would like to do.

03:32.653 --> 03:35.417
It was really a new type of military service.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.280
And he said, oh, don't do that.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.303
And he discouraged me, but...

03:40.672 --> 03:51.802
Went to the library and read all I could about it, and it became a goal of mine to try to get into the United States Army paratroopers.

03:51.922 --> 03:53.283
And you did, as a matter of fact.

03:53.303 --> 03:57.487
You found that the quickest way to get to the action, you indeed actually had to quit school.

03:57.907 --> 03:59.408
And talk about that.

03:59.428 --> 04:10.678
You quit school, and the next day, your sergeant came up to you, and what did he say to you the next day after you quit?

04:10.895 --> 04:15.681
close grip on us in the ROTC, and they made us semi-active.

04:15.761 --> 04:21.449
We were on active ROTC duty until we finished school and so forth.

04:21.549 --> 04:29.880
And I heard that if you failed or you got in trouble or you resigned from school, you would go into the Army immediately.

04:30.520 --> 04:38.691
So I went and resigned, and I was in Cebiza Metz Hall for breakfast the next day.

04:39.295 --> 04:45.246
And a regular Army sergeant, Sergeant Sabo, came up to me and said, what have you done?

04:46.248 --> 04:47.810
And I said, why do you mean?

04:47.890 --> 04:53.220
He said, you have to report the Fort Sam Houston Induction Center in 24 hours.

04:53.487 --> 04:55.550
And I was soon in the army.

04:56.030 --> 04:56.832
You were soon there.

04:56.892 --> 05:01.999
And you actually volunteered for a paratroop school in Fort Benning because that's what you wanted to do.

05:02.019 --> 05:06.164
So you volunteered and you went to the training and that training was tough.

05:06.385 --> 05:11.492
As a matter of fact, you compared it to coach Bear Bryant's Junction boys type of training.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.054
It was very severe.

05:13.074 --> 05:13.955
It was cruel.

05:14.916 --> 05:19.783
It was Bear Bryant's Junction type treatment of us.

05:20.123 --> 05:20.524
And I

05:21.027 --> 05:34.164
The reason for it, I know, was the paratroopers, people could volunteer for the paratroops from any branch of the service if they had had basic training or more experience.

05:35.165 --> 05:39.151
And they did because there was an incentive in more pay.

05:39.952 --> 05:41.854
It was a new type of uniform.

05:42.256 --> 05:47.443
Paratroopers wore boots before anybody else in the Army wore boots and got silver wings.

05:48.225 --> 05:50.448
And so there was a great incentive.

05:50.888 --> 05:59.781
And then they decided that they had to see how serious these volunteers were.

06:00.783 --> 06:08.634
And they would allow anyone that didn't like that severe type of training to request for transfer.

06:08.994 --> 06:09.495
And

06:09.475 --> 06:14.001
be moved out without any embarrassment or anything, and many people

06:14.335 --> 06:16.337
Yeah, you talked about the incentive.

06:16.377 --> 06:22.002
I think the paratroopers got $50 a month, whereas the normal private got $21 a month.

06:22.022 --> 06:24.284
So there was a financial incentive to stick with it.

06:24.304 --> 06:27.827
It was, and that was a lot of money then in those years.

06:28.348 --> 06:35.254
Eventually you were sent to England and you joined up with the 82nd Airborne, a very famous organization for its service in the war.

06:35.755 --> 06:39.618
It had been a very active unit before you got there, right?

06:39.758 --> 06:40.519
Yes, sir.

06:40.539 --> 06:42.621
It had been through Africa and

06:43.006 --> 06:58.510
They trained in North Africa and jumped on July the 9th, 1943 into Sicily and were very, very instrumental in helping defeat the Germans and Italians on the island of Sicily.

06:58.911 --> 07:00.033
I want to fast forward a little bit.

07:00.073 --> 07:03.959
February of 1944 is actually when you went overseas, you told me.

07:04.520 --> 07:11.190
And you were sent to Ireland, Scotland, and then to sort of the midlands of England where you trained for the invasion.

07:11.558 --> 07:14.081
Talk a little bit about that.

07:14.101 --> 07:28.860
Well, the middle part of England is where the troop carrier airplanes were, the cargo ships that were also used to jump paratroopers, to haul personnel and everything from gasoline to ammunition.

07:29.401 --> 07:33.446
They were called in the Army, the term is C-47s.

07:34.027 --> 07:40.435
The British call them the Dakotas, and they were DC-3s or 4s.

07:40.685 --> 07:42.206
Maybe both.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.350
But we trained there very hard.

07:45.490 --> 07:56.120
And we had to go down into Wales to actually use our guns and have live ammunition for practice.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.202
But they took us down there and brought us back.

07:59.203 --> 08:08.952
And we made a great deal of physical exercise and training to be in good shape physically.

08:09.313 --> 08:09.713
Indeed.

08:10.267 --> 08:13.471
Let's take it to, I guess, June the 5th, 1944.

08:13.772 --> 08:25.587
This had been the day before the invasion, and it was actually 10 o'clock that night that your plane took off, and your unit jumped behind the German lines at Utah Beach at about midnight, right?

08:25.627 --> 08:28.891
This would have been just a few hours before the beach invasion.

08:28.911 --> 08:29.352
Is that right?

08:29.372 --> 08:33.237
What do you remember about that, about that trip, about that?

08:33.858 --> 08:36.722
two hours of flying before you actually jumped.

08:37.143 --> 08:42.050
What were the thoughts of you and your fellow paratroopers?

08:42.070 --> 09:01.519
We had seen pictures of the defense, and we had seen that he made some sand tables of our objectives, and the defense that had set up looked pretty discouraging, and the veterans in the outfit were

09:01.988 --> 09:08.937
very aware that this was probably the most dangerous situation they had ever been into, and they had been in many.

09:10.519 --> 09:12.501
So we were apprehensive.

09:12.842 --> 09:23.015
Our officers came, and our chaplain, and built up our spirits, and I think we were in high spirits when we left.

09:23.615 --> 09:31.185
Of course, D-Day had been delayed, and we had been at these airports for quite a while, and everybody was nervous, and...

09:31.655 --> 09:33.196
kind of worn out from worry.

09:34.217 --> 09:42.125
But nevertheless, England was under double daylight saving time then.

09:42.645 --> 09:47.630
So even though it was late clockwise, it was still twilight.

09:48.010 --> 10:00.261
And then we flew south and when we approached the coast of France, the western coast of the Normandy Peninsula, they had to stand up and hook up in case the plane was hit.

10:00.663 --> 10:02.145
We'd try to get people out.

10:03.728 --> 10:08.214
We were, I think everybody had a lot of adrenaline in them.

10:08.234 --> 10:21.554
We could see the coast and we could see from earlier flights, the ground fire going up and it just looked like a solid sheet of tracers and anti-aircraft fire.

10:22.055 --> 10:27.683
And when we were looking out the little windows and wondered how we would get through that.

10:28.625 --> 10:33.731
And when we got into it, we could hear bullets hitting the plane.

10:33.871 --> 10:41.660
And one guy, it wasn't in my plane, but the one guy, they said in one of the planes afterwards said, they don't pay us enough for this.

10:42.962 --> 10:46.065
It was just a joke that got passed around later.

10:47.127 --> 10:54.035
A fog bank closed in, and planes had to disperse to keep from hitting each other.

10:54.055 --> 10:58.480
And paratroopers were scattered quite a bit, we found out later.

10:59.303 --> 11:20.405
When we get the time to jump, the pilot was homing in on radio devices that were planted two or three hours earlier by what we called our group that went in early and set up these devices called pathfinders.

11:21.166 --> 11:24.349
They're totally organized and trained to do that.

11:24.937 --> 11:40.673
And then when they reach their designated place, they give us a signal in the back by the door, a red light to get ready and move up close to the door and then a green light to go out.

11:41.574 --> 11:43.155
And then we go out.

11:46.359 --> 11:54.707
Because I think of the amount of ground fire and the fact of fog and everything, our particular

11:55.312 --> 11:56.554
plane was too low.

11:56.674 --> 12:07.909
We didn't have much time in the air, which is almost good, too, but most of us hit the ground real hard, including me.

12:12.174 --> 12:18.182
We found out later some of our paratroopers were dropped in the flooded areas of the lowlands.

12:18.202 --> 12:21.707
The Germans had broken dams and flooded areas, and we had

12:22.109 --> 12:35.187
Quite a few people lost, and of course at night we had quite a job to locate each other and to find each other and to try to find out where we were and where our objectives were.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.571
Right, your objective was to take the town of St.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.353
Mary Glees.

12:39.453 --> 12:40.774
That was your objective.

12:41.616 --> 12:44.780
Our division, the 82nd Airborne Division, was to take the town.

12:45.401 --> 12:48.505
It was a crossroad of highways

12:48.940 --> 13:08.086
and a railroad leading up to the beaches, and the German tanks and infantry was in reserve, and we were to make every effort to prevent them from getting there or delay their getting there to counterattack the beach assault.

13:08.106 --> 13:18.880
A lot of those who actually landed in the town were lost because of the armament there in the town, but you believe that you landed about two miles south of the town and then moved into the town, right?

13:19.282 --> 13:32.220
I know you told me about your commander who had kept an American flag from his own experience in Naples, Italy, and he kept that flag, and he made a pledge about that flag.

13:32.280 --> 13:32.981
Talk about that.

13:33.061 --> 13:33.662
Well, we left.

13:34.603 --> 13:41.533
Colonel Walter Crouch had promised that he would raise the flag over the city hall in St.

13:41.573 --> 13:46.099
Mary Glees before daylight on D-Day,

13:46.636 --> 13:52.164
And this was the same flag that he had raised over the city hall in Naples.

13:52.184 --> 13:56.631
Our division had captured Naples in the Italian campaign.

13:57.573 --> 14:00.497
And he did that.

14:00.517 --> 14:02.200
He actually did it.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.964
He had gathered together a force after he landed.

14:05.004 --> 14:06.827
He landed near St.

14:06.847 --> 14:10.332
Mary Gliese and had about 180 soldiers.

14:10.885 --> 14:17.594
Paratroopers, incidentally, a few were from the 101st Airborne that had been lost in the fog.

14:18.776 --> 14:26.447
And attacked the town and killed the men in the German garrison, or they escaped.

14:26.907 --> 14:33.737
And then we were to hold the town until we were relieved by the forces from the beaches.

14:34.426 --> 14:41.873
I want to pause here because I want to show a couple of pictures that you allowed us to show here on the show.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.495
These are a couple of pictures of you.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.357
And there, you can see that picture there.

14:45.437 --> 14:51.543
That is the young Lewis Hudson as a cadet at Texas A&M.

14:51.563 --> 14:53.024
What year do you think that was taken?

14:53.504 --> 14:55.086
That was when I was a sophomore.

14:55.106 --> 14:55.967
When you were a sophomore.

14:55.987 --> 15:01.913
So that would have been in 1941 at around the time of D-Day.

15:02.393 --> 15:03.454
And here you are later.

15:04.885 --> 15:08.029
This would have been later when you were actually enlisted, right?

15:08.049 --> 15:09.551
I was in England.

15:10.032 --> 15:10.232
Right.

15:10.372 --> 15:17.161
And that was, I think, maybe in May before D-Day in June.

15:17.181 --> 15:17.401
Right.

15:17.421 --> 15:23.069
You have your wings all ready that you earned as a paratrooper and a good-looking soldier.

15:23.449 --> 15:24.771
Now, this is you and your half-brother.

15:24.971 --> 15:25.832
Talk about this picture.

15:26.573 --> 15:30.859
This picture was taken in Baltimore, Maryland in December.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.094
early December of 1943.

15:35.135 --> 15:49.916
He was on the battleship Nevada and had been brought into Boston and had discovered from my letters that I was probably at Fort Meade, Maryland.

15:49.936 --> 15:58.028
And he got permission to come down there and found me and got permission from me to spend the weekend with him.

15:58.531 --> 16:04.097
And we had that picture taken in Baltimore, and it was sent to our mother.

16:04.157 --> 16:06.259
He sent one and I sent one.

16:06.279 --> 16:07.720
And we wrote her a letter.

16:07.740 --> 16:21.635
And we spent that weekend not sightseeing or not doing anything except talking about home and our family and all our relatives.

16:21.855 --> 16:27.501
And he had been gone quite a while and had been in the Lucian campaign.

16:27.641 --> 16:27.981
Yes, sir.

16:28.214 --> 16:32.358
with the Battleship Nevada and come back through for convoy duty.

16:32.378 --> 16:34.220
Right, great memories, great memories.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.282
Let's go back to Normandy.

16:36.342 --> 16:40.967
Eventually you've accomplished your objective and you head back to the beach.

16:41.107 --> 16:43.349
You march back to Utah Beach.

16:43.409 --> 16:49.775
And I know that on that march back at the beach, you saw many of the ugly remnants of the invasion on D-Day.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.521
What was so impressive was the fact that

16:56.530 --> 16:58.654
We lost a lot of our tanks.

16:59.515 --> 17:07.709
They had been destroyed by the German resistance, and they were pushed over to the side of the road, and we passed these.

17:08.570 --> 17:21.913
And then a huge amount of soldiers' gear, their bags and their equipment and their weapons, if they had been wounded or killed, were stacked in large piles.

17:22.501 --> 17:23.943
on our way back.

17:23.963 --> 17:31.172
And this was after we had been in combat over 30 days, something like 33 or 35 days.

17:32.053 --> 17:44.028
And we were taken back to England and we loaded on LSTs and went back over to England from Normandy.

17:44.048 --> 17:49.875
And one of the first things you did when you got back to England was take a bath because you've been in the same uniform for over a month.

17:51.020 --> 18:00.551
Our uniforms before Normandy had been treated with a material to prevent gas from penetrating.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.814
And they were very hot.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.776
And we were in June and July.

18:05.697 --> 18:12.585
And it was, so we didn't really have much chance to bathe.

18:14.167 --> 18:17.171
We were under fire most of the time.

18:18.152 --> 18:19.153
And...

18:19.724 --> 18:24.992
So we noticed the sailors kept quite a distance from us

18:25.512 --> 18:28.616
After we got on the LSDs.

18:28.636 --> 18:30.278
You had the place to yourself, pretty much.

18:31.959 --> 18:41.170
Later on, you were supposed to do another jump into Belgium, but that was called off, you told me, because of the intense pressure that the Germans were putting on at this time.

18:41.190 --> 18:50.601
But there was a story that you told, and this talks to the intensity of the war, a story you told me about a Polish paratrooper who made a very unfortunate decision.

18:51.062 --> 18:52.884
Tell me that story again.

18:52.904 --> 18:53.224
Yes.

18:53.592 --> 18:58.076
We were on the plane, the motors were running, and they called a mission off.

18:58.136 --> 19:02.640
We were to go in and hold bridges in Belgium.

19:02.660 --> 19:11.228
And when we got off the plane to be trucked back to our camp, I noticed a huge crowd in the plane next to us.

19:11.248 --> 19:16.193
And a soldier came over from that, and we asked what happened.

19:16.333 --> 19:21.658
And he said, well, this was a Polish group that had...

19:22.077 --> 19:25.922
was to be in part of the mission in Belgium.

19:25.942 --> 19:31.769
And as they were loading on the plane, one of the soldiers refused to get on.

19:31.789 --> 19:41.921
And his commanding officer came and ordered him on the plane, and he refused again, and his officer shot him and killed him.

19:41.941 --> 19:47.207
And it was so ironical and so sad

19:47.828 --> 20:01.021
that all of us felt like, had he obeyed orders and got on the plane, because the mission was called off, it was such a waste of life that he had made that choice.

20:01.962 --> 20:03.463
Indeed, and that could be part of the war.

20:03.883 --> 20:08.968
Instead of jumping into Belgium, you jumped into Holland in an operation that was called Market Garden.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.970
Talk about that operation.

20:11.271 --> 20:15.895
That was in September, and it was a daylight jump, and we...

20:16.600 --> 20:20.564
obviously had air supremacy.

20:20.584 --> 20:36.018
And the airborne forces in the planes and gliders went in greatly protected through a tunnel of British and American aircraft.

20:36.038 --> 20:42.564
And they were pretty well neutralizing anything that was on the ground shooting at us.

20:42.584 --> 20:46.388
The jumps were in daylight and they were in open fields.

20:46.722 --> 20:53.329
and we were able to locate our bundles and equipment, guns and ammunition.

20:54.550 --> 21:02.478
We were able to locate where our mission was and we were able to organize properly and it was very good.

21:03.199 --> 21:16.392
However, Holland became a real hornet's nest because the German forces were very strong and they attempted to get rid of us

21:17.165 --> 21:21.809
and we were under constant attack the whole time in the island.

21:22.350 --> 21:31.859
However, the American 101st Airborne and 82nd Airborne were able to capture and hold the bridges that were assigned to us.

21:33.500 --> 21:47.053
The British Red Devil paratrooper division jumped at Arnheim and had a great deal more difficulty, and they were the farthest away from the land forces,

21:47.337 --> 21:54.368
were greatly, they had great casualties, in fact, almost annihilated.

21:54.388 --> 21:59.495
And later, we were all withdrawn down into North France.

21:59.956 --> 22:08.549
And we read later that that operation was not considered very successful.

22:09.270 --> 22:14.678
However, we knew we had done what we were supposed to.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.263
And so had the other American division.

22:17.464 --> 22:27.057
Eventually you were back to France in December the 16th, 1944, German offensive at the Ardennes Forest, which became the Battle of the Bulge.

22:27.077 --> 22:27.858
It was very cold.

22:27.938 --> 22:28.899
The weather was horrible.

22:28.979 --> 22:30.742
Talk about what you remember about the bulge.

22:31.683 --> 22:36.930
Well, we were in North France, near the Reims area of France.

22:36.950 --> 22:40.135
And both airborne divisions were there.

22:40.235 --> 22:44.040
And almost everybody that

22:45.016 --> 23:13.993
night that we were notified we were either watching a movie we had our own movies the 8mm type movies and we or we're playing cards or writing letters or something and then we heard everywhere they were announcing for officers to report to their headquarters and then they call non-commissioned officers and then they tell everybody go to your barracks go to your

23:14.176 --> 23:15.357
where you sleep.

23:16.198 --> 23:23.227
Our particular outfit was in a French artillery fort that the Germans had occupied, and we were occupying it.

23:23.968 --> 23:31.357
And then we were told that we were going, that the Germans had lost a great attack in the Ardennes area.

23:31.437 --> 23:36.763
We didn't know where it was, but they told us it was in Belgium.

23:37.304 --> 23:43.491
And they loaded us up into trucks, and we were trucked at night.

23:43.910 --> 23:48.495
got into that area, both the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions.

23:48.655 --> 23:55.602
And they unloaded us, gave us ammunition, told us the direction we were to go in.

23:56.603 --> 24:03.910
And it was a little frightening because there were so many people retreating away from that advance.

24:05.071 --> 24:11.217
And then our first units ran into Germans who were in American uniforms and American vehicles.

24:11.737 --> 24:29.222
And our first units had a hard time, lost quite a few men until it was discovered that they were, by the way, all of those that got caught were shot or impersonating Americans.

24:29.442 --> 24:29.723
Right.

24:30.544 --> 24:41.119
We've only got about three minutes left, but I want you to talk about a gentleman that you talk very highly of, a general who is not as known as other generals of World War II, General James Gavin.

24:41.150 --> 24:45.939
was your commanding general, and it's a person that I know that you think very highly of.

24:45.959 --> 24:52.631
Yes, he is a great man, in my opinion, and I think most of the men in the 82nd Airborne Division.

24:53.112 --> 24:56.618
He was our assistant division commander in Normandy.

24:56.999 --> 24:59.603
He was a regimental commander in Sicily and Italy.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.130
He later became the division commander.

25:03.551 --> 25:04.913
He was a fighting general.

25:05.450 --> 25:09.196
In the air assault, he was in the first plane.

25:09.336 --> 25:12.420
After the Pathfinders, he was the first man out.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.862
He carried an M1 rifle.

25:14.383 --> 25:16.366
He was active in combat.

25:16.486 --> 25:25.279
He never depended upon messengers or any other type of communications to find out how the battle was going.

25:25.339 --> 25:26.461
He went to the battle.

25:26.501 --> 25:32.530
Anytime you were in a firefight, you might turn around and see General Gavin there.

25:33.251 --> 25:34.613
He knew how to move

25:34.947 --> 25:38.493
his regiments and battalions to the hottest spots.

25:38.633 --> 25:41.217
He was a soldier's man.

25:43.321 --> 25:45.985
We admired him and loved him greatly.

25:46.005 --> 25:47.408
We would follow him anywhere.

25:47.548 --> 25:59.267
As a matter of fact, when you were preparing for a possible ground invasion of Japan, which fortunately never happened, he told you that if need be, he'd be the first one to jump out over Tokyo and wanted to know who would follow, right?

25:59.804 --> 26:17.155
He had a division meeting and stood on the Jeep with a loudspeaker and said he wanted, he was going to volunteer the division to fight in the Pacific and that he wanted to know how many would join him and jump on Tokyo with him

26:17.607 --> 26:22.213
Take one step forward, and every man there took one step forward.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.054
Absolutely.

26:24.116 --> 26:28.021
Lewis Hudson, you and your wife, Jo, have three daughters and two grandchildren.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.283
You're proud of all of them.

26:29.303 --> 26:40.638
And I know that upon your, you were through with your service, you went back to A&M, you graduated from A&M, and you became a longtime educator in Somerville, I believe, and other places.

26:40.658 --> 26:43.362
And I wish we could go on and talk more, but we are out of time.

26:43.382 --> 26:45.184
And thank you very much for your service.

26:45.350 --> 26:46.592
Thank you, Tom.

26:46.612 --> 26:49.476
We have uncommon heroes among us in the Brazos Valley.

26:49.616 --> 26:51.018
Lewis Hudson is one of them.

26:51.959 --> 26:53.741
He saw the horror of war.

26:53.761 --> 27:00.450
It stays in his mind, even in his dreams sometimes, those stories he won't discuss, the stories he can't discuss.

27:00.470 --> 27:06.378
What he does tell us reveals a man of honor, a man of pride, a man with the love of his country and his God.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.060
We salute his service.

27:09.162 --> 27:11.385
Thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:11.906 --> 27:12.927
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:13.328 --> 27:40.686
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
