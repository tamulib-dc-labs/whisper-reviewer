and accessibility as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:32.684 --> 00:37.250
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.472
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:39.492 --> 00:46.901
You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who knows more about feeding massive numbers of people at one time than Colonel Jim Moore.

00:46.921 --> 00:53.890
He's been involved with food service, well really, since 1945, when he was given a job as cook's helper at Fort Bliss.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.772
A job he hated, by the way.

00:56.174 --> 01:03.283
He's come a long way from then to having spent eight years as the Associate Director of Food Services at Texas A&M, his alma mater.

01:03.884 --> 01:11.794
He learned much of his craft in the service, having joined the Army near the end of World War II and serving in the Korean War and in Vietnam.

01:11.814 --> 01:18.803
And along the way, he earned some quite impressive diplomas from Texas A&M and from MIT.

01:18.823 --> 01:20.325
Please welcome to Veterans of the Valley,

01:20.693 --> 01:21.514
Colonel Jim Moore.

01:21.674 --> 01:24.499
Jim, it is an honor to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:24.559 --> 01:25.580
Thank you for your service.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.306
First off, you grew up in Dallas, Sunset High School.

01:29.346 --> 01:30.708
That's where you grew up.

01:30.728 --> 01:32.370
You lived in Greenville for a time.

01:32.731 --> 01:35.194
You left Dallas and went into the military in 1944.

01:35.335 --> 01:37.377
Sort of take us from there.

01:37.398 --> 01:41.824
You went to Oklahoma for a year and then finally went into the service.

01:42.513 --> 01:47.259
Well, when you're in our senior year at high school, you could take a test.

01:47.299 --> 01:54.167
And if you pass the test with the Army, it was a military type thing where they would send you off to school, specialized training program.

01:54.227 --> 01:58.532
So a group of us from Sunset took that test and we passed it.

01:58.632 --> 02:03.157
And then we were shipped off to Norman, Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma.

02:03.237 --> 02:08.584
And there was a bunch of Navy people that were there.

02:08.604 --> 02:11.507
And then there was a bunch of Army people that came in at the same time we did.

02:12.145 --> 02:20.477
probably two or three hundred and we stayed there for a year from June of 45, 44 to June of 45.

02:22.119 --> 02:25.183
And then when I finished that year.

02:25.524 --> 02:26.385
You were a young guy, you were 17.

02:26.405 --> 02:28.888
17, I went in at 17.

02:29.009 --> 02:30.711
Right, right.

02:30.944 --> 02:36.697
they shipped us off to Camp Anton, Texas, which was at Tyler.

02:37.639 --> 02:40.705
And now that I think it's the Texas Medical Center over there now.

02:41.467 --> 02:50.607
But it was the infantry basic training and basically we were getting ready, we were getting training to go to invade Japan.

02:50.587 --> 03:00.360
Well, we were there, of course, the infantry was about a 16-week infantry basic training, and near the end of our stay there, the war was over then.

03:00.380 --> 03:15.481
They dropped the atomic bomb, and like one of your people said before, it was nice to not have to go, because it would have been a very hard task to have been invasion of Japan.

03:15.501 --> 03:18.565
You were pretty certain, probably, that you were going to be fighting in World War II.

03:19.146 --> 03:19.407
That's right.

03:19.427 --> 03:19.767
Absolutely.

03:20.168 --> 03:24.397
Instead, you went from Tyler to Fort Bliss, which was quite a trip, about 800 miles by train.

03:24.417 --> 03:24.978
By train.

03:24.998 --> 03:29.768
It took us about two days to get there by train at that time.

03:30.389 --> 03:32.955
Fort Bliss, of course, in El Paso.

03:33.155 --> 03:36.803
First job at your first duty at Fort Bliss as a prison chaser.

03:36.863 --> 03:37.384
What was that?

03:38.039 --> 03:56.200
Well, they had a big stockade there, and every day the prison system, you took four prisoners, one guard with four prisoners, and you went out and did various tasks, cut grass, cleaned up the chapel, cleaned up barracks and things like that.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.243
And I didn't like that either because that was a five and a half day.

03:59.303 --> 04:00.325
You didn't have any time off.

04:00.345 --> 04:01.566
You had a half a day all Sunday.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.864
So I wasn't too happy about that job either.

04:05.265 --> 04:08.490
And the next job you were assigned to as a cook's helper.

04:08.871 --> 04:14.299
Did you have any idea when you were assigned as a cook's helper that that would end up being your career in food service?

04:14.319 --> 04:15.281
No, I had no idea.

04:16.202 --> 04:16.843
Because you didn't like it.

04:16.863 --> 04:22.272
And I didn't like that either because you were working when all your other buddies were off.

04:22.657 --> 04:33.028
Like you would go, they had you on shifts, and you always, I would have been working every weekend, and my friends that I ran around with, of course, they didn't, at that time, they didn't have to work on the weekends.

04:33.528 --> 04:38.854
So I'd be working, they'd be off, and then when I was off, they'd be working, so I didn't, that wasn't very much.

04:38.874 --> 04:47.263
But one thing that was interesting was there was a bunch of Army POW, I mean, German POWs that I worked with, and that was very interesting.

04:47.682 --> 04:56.730
These POWs, they had pictures of all their family and most of them you could talk, speak, converse with them a little bit with English.

04:57.301 --> 05:00.687
But none of them ever fought on the, they all fought against the Russians.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.611
None of them ever fought against Americans.

05:02.831 --> 05:03.312
Exactly.

05:03.372 --> 05:07.019
Well, right here in the Brazos Valley, we have a Camp Hearn, which is a lot.

05:07.039 --> 05:07.640
Yeah, that's right.

05:07.660 --> 05:11.888
You know, the stories there, because that was a German POW camp also.

05:11.908 --> 05:14.412
You went to an anti-aircraft group.

05:14.452 --> 05:18.600
You re-upped for 12 months, and when people were starting to get discharged,

05:18.732 --> 05:20.256
and you were an acting sergeant major.

05:21.118 --> 05:26.652
You wanted to go back to college, and then that was your first experience at Texas A&M, because you always wanted to be an Aggie.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.342
Your brother, who had fought in World War II, was injured in the Battle of the Bulge.

05:30.442 --> 05:34.192
He was Aggie class of 43, so you wanted to follow in his footsteps, right?

05:34.272 --> 05:35.796
That's absolutely right.

05:36.029 --> 05:45.678
I probably followed him because he was also become a regular army officer, and so I just followed his footsteps and stayed in the army for 29 years.

05:45.719 --> 05:49.502
So you came in essentially as a sophomore, which was called a frog back then.

05:49.662 --> 05:49.963
Right.

05:50.223 --> 05:51.564
What was the difference between a frog and a fish?

05:52.625 --> 05:56.749
Well, I think frogs are just worse.

05:57.170 --> 06:04.517
Well, you came in, and I came in in February of 47, and I could have gone into a VA outfit

06:05.020 --> 06:11.129
But because my brother had gone through the hazing and things, I wanted to do also.

06:12.171 --> 06:23.308
And that was a little testing for me because I guess I was about 20 and most of the guys, my sophomores were 17 or 18.

06:23.328 --> 06:25.712
They were always on my rear end doing something.

06:25.692 --> 06:39.625
go and get mail, or I was made to a junior, and I had to bake up his bed, and shine his shoes, and go get water for him at nighttime, and I didn't, that wasn't, but I gutted it out for that one semester.

06:39.765 --> 06:42.347
What was Texas A&M like in the late 40s like that?

06:42.387 --> 06:44.749
I mean, you look at the campus now and the school now.

06:44.769 --> 06:46.711
Oh my gosh, it was completely different.

06:47.011 --> 06:53.337
You walked to all your classes, you had 10 minutes to get from one class to the other, but that was no problem.

06:54.025 --> 07:00.115
I had one class across the railroad tracks on the west campus, and that was dairy husbandry.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.059
That was a dairy lab.

07:02.079 --> 07:05.084
And you could hustle over there if you walked fast without any problem.

07:05.104 --> 07:08.710
So there was no cars, very few cars on campus.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.850
freshmen had to walk in the street.

07:11.170 --> 07:13.312
You couldn't walk on the sidewalk.

07:14.033 --> 07:18.417
You had to run up and meet all the upperclassmen if you didn't know them or they didn't know you.

07:19.318 --> 07:20.919
So it was pretty exciting.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.901
Kept it pretty busy.

07:22.921 --> 07:23.782
You were classed in 1949.

07:24.303 --> 07:25.584
He graduated in 1949.

07:26.184 --> 07:31.309
And you were sent to Fort Riley for officers basic training then.

07:31.710 --> 07:35.153
And you were also joined up by some West Point grads.

07:35.521 --> 07:36.262
at that time, right?

07:36.282 --> 07:42.593
There was about 600 of us there and 300 West Point grads and about 300 ROTC graduates were there.

07:43.094 --> 07:51.808
And basically it was an infantry basic, it was an officer training center actually for officer school, for basic training is what it was.

07:53.324 --> 08:04.484
call it ground school, ground basic training where you took map reading and you had to take a 50-calorie machine gun apart and put it back together blindfolded and those type of things.

08:04.624 --> 08:05.786
Exactly, exactly.

08:06.908 --> 08:08.491
You were sent back to a familiar place.

08:08.511 --> 08:11.175
You were sent back to Fort Bliss for a while and then to Fort Sill.

08:11.716 --> 08:11.837
Right.

08:11.857 --> 08:16.024
And you talked about how you and your wife had gone home to Dallas.

08:16.358 --> 08:19.502
You were driving back up to Fort Sill, and you heard something on the radio.

08:19.522 --> 08:21.124
Yeah, the Korean War broke out.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.467
This was about June of 26, I think.

08:23.768 --> 08:39.008
We were driving back, and this was probably 10 or 11 o'clock at nighttime, going back to Fort Sill, and the North Koreans that invaded South Korea.

08:38.988 --> 08:43.340
So that was, you know, sort of a, well, what's going to happen now?

08:44.143 --> 08:54.111
Because we were getting ready to graduate from artillery school, and we had put in to go to Japan as concurrent travel.

08:54.614 --> 08:55.717
So we just had to wait.

08:55.737 --> 08:58.022
Well, we knew that that wasn't gonna come to pass.

08:58.042 --> 09:11.475
So we ended up having to report out to, after we graduated in July, I think it was, we went directly out to Travis Air Force Base and I flew into Japan.

09:11.489 --> 09:13.592
Right, you flew to Tokyo.

09:13.732 --> 09:15.234
Stopped at Midway and had a drink, right?

09:15.274 --> 09:15.735
That's right.

09:15.775 --> 09:16.335
At 6 a.m.

09:16.355 --> 09:16.736
in the morning.

09:17.297 --> 09:18.478
That's true.

09:18.498 --> 09:22.263
And alcohol was easy to get, but the mixer was not easy to get.

09:22.844 --> 09:26.188
They gave you a three-fourth glass of alcohol and a fourth of a mixer.

09:27.470 --> 09:28.591
What was Camp Drake like?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.395
It was a replacement camp in Tokyo, right?

09:31.415 --> 09:35.320
It was just a bunch of soldiers there.

09:35.806 --> 09:38.509
and all of them were getting ready to ship out someplace.

09:38.770 --> 09:39.010
Right.

09:39.711 --> 09:46.520
And basically, they didn't have much to do, but I stayed there, I think, about two or three days.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.021
Right.

09:47.221 --> 09:49.143
That was it.

09:49.203 --> 09:51.486
Didn't know exactly what direction this conflict was going to go.

09:51.526 --> 09:54.951
There was some concern that the North Koreans might bomb Japan.

09:54.971 --> 09:58.636
So you all were sort of in a defensive mode there, right?

09:58.656 --> 09:58.876
Right.

09:59.336 --> 09:59.557
Yeah, yeah.

09:59.577 --> 10:00.458
That's when I ended up.

10:00.818 --> 10:02.100
They sent me...

10:02.907 --> 10:09.654
Since I'd had anti-aircraft artillery training, they sent me to an anti-aircraft battalion.

10:09.894 --> 10:10.775
120 millimeter?

10:10.895 --> 10:12.136
120 millimeter battalion.

10:12.176 --> 10:19.183
We dispersed out into the rice paddies of the Japanese countryside outside of Tachikawa, which was an Air Force base.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.045
Tachikawa had a big Air Force base there.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.006
Right, right.

10:23.047 --> 10:29.073
You were later moved to a howitzer team, a 105 howitzer outfit.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.075
Well, what happened is,

10:31.308 --> 10:46.841
as I understand it at the time was that the 24th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division had been pretty much annihilated at Tegu and so they brought the flags back and wanted to re-establish a regimental combat team.

10:46.861 --> 10:47.562
So then

10:47.845 --> 10:57.695
They pulled me out of the anti-aircraft outfit and put me into this reforming of this regimental combat team.

10:58.796 --> 11:01.679
And so it ended up in a 105 Howitzer Battalion.

11:01.699 --> 11:03.661
I think it was, I can't exactly remember the name of it.

11:03.682 --> 11:07.265
I think it was 63rd Battalion, Artillery Battalion.

11:07.485 --> 11:08.466
Right.

11:08.507 --> 11:10.168
You went to Mount Fuji in August of 1951.

11:10.188 --> 11:13.111
And you climbed Mount Fuji, is that right?

11:13.612 --> 11:14.232
With a longhorn.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.054
With a longhorn, that's right.

11:16.094 --> 11:17.616
Tell that story.

11:18.052 --> 11:30.509
Actually, we dispersed out into Mount Fuji probably in about January or February of 1951 to do training for going to Korea.

11:31.010 --> 11:35.015
So we were out there running through training exercises and doing maneuvers and things like that.

11:36.197 --> 11:45.730
And in August, before that, in April 21st, was muster day, and they had a big muster at Tokyo Officers Club.

11:46.165 --> 11:48.647
So I had a UT captain that was real nice.

11:48.727 --> 11:57.716
He was a former lawyer, had been in the military in World War II and combat in World War II, and really a nice person.

11:57.796 --> 12:02.721
And I asked him if we had about three West Pointers that were in our outfit.

12:02.761 --> 12:06.524
And so I asked him if we could go down, take them down to the muster.

12:07.265 --> 12:08.186
And he said, yeah, go ahead.

12:08.246 --> 12:14.552
So we walked down to the train station, which was about a mile and a half, took it to Tokyo.

12:15.005 --> 12:19.483
There's probably about 300 or 400 Aggies at that muster.

12:20.086 --> 12:24.444
And these West Point guys were really amazed.

12:24.484 --> 12:24.745
They said,

12:25.163 --> 12:36.796
Man, we didn't know you had anything like that going on, where all of them mustered together and stuff, and they were very, they thought they had a good time, and they were really praising the Aggies for getting together like that.

12:36.916 --> 12:37.737
That's a great story.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.742
Matter of fact, later on, when you were in Vietnam, you got to go to a muster in Vietnam also.

12:42.783 --> 12:46.827
August 15, 1951, you got on an LST for Inchon.

12:46.847 --> 12:47.688
Right.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.952
This must have been three days where, you know,

12:51.438 --> 12:57.026
Young Jim Moore from Dallas, Texas, from Sunset High School, must have realized, like, it's not training anymore.

12:57.086 --> 12:57.928
This is really it.

12:58.108 --> 12:58.989
I'm heading off to war.

12:59.550 --> 13:00.171
What was that like?

13:01.032 --> 13:09.144
Well, you do a lot of sort of deep thinking, meditating, and you think about some of your past life.

13:09.284 --> 13:13.911
And actually, I only married a year at that particular time.

13:13.991 --> 13:20.601
And so I thought back through some of our dating time when we were courting each other

13:21.205 --> 13:24.850
And it was a three-day trip, and we didn't have much to do.

13:24.870 --> 13:29.437
There wasn't much to lay around on the deck or something like that.

13:30.258 --> 13:34.343
And you think, well, you know, what's going to happen?

13:35.425 --> 13:37.668
What actually are we getting into?

13:38.489 --> 13:39.771
So it's very...

13:39.886 --> 13:50.860
thought-provoking and really looking back over your life and trying to determine, well, has my life been pretty good or hasn't it?

13:52.402 --> 13:55.506
I bet it is for a young man.

13:55.926 --> 14:01.033
It is, I don't want to say, it's sort of exciting.

14:01.013 --> 14:03.157
in a different and a funny way.

14:03.337 --> 14:05.522
Sure, exactly.

14:05.542 --> 14:11.313
I want to go ahead now, let's go to some photographs, some pictures that you supplied for us.

14:11.814 --> 14:15.681
Some of the pictures are going to reference what we referenced in our opening.

14:16.117 --> 14:20.681
about his career in food service, which we'll be talking about here in just a little bit.

14:20.981 --> 14:22.323
Let's go ahead and go to some pictures now.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.545
There is a young cadet.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.046
I was a junior at A&M there.

14:26.386 --> 14:27.608
Jim Moore.

14:27.628 --> 14:29.870
Good looking.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.271
You were a junior there.

14:31.431 --> 14:32.952
You were past being a frog.

14:33.213 --> 14:34.754
I was past being a frog.

14:34.994 --> 14:36.135
You pretty much knew everything.

14:36.236 --> 14:36.556
Right.

14:37.717 --> 14:40.379
At least I wasn't getting hazed.

14:40.399 --> 14:40.920
That's right.

14:41.420 --> 14:43.322
You were on top of everything.

14:43.302 --> 14:46.305
Yeah, good starch in the collar, shined collar ornaments.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.126
Oh, yeah.

14:47.246 --> 14:49.068
Yeah, did they have Brasso back then?

14:49.088 --> 14:50.589
Is that what they did?

14:50.609 --> 14:52.551
Oh, yeah, they had some kind of Brasso.

14:52.571 --> 14:53.733
Sure, okay, let's move on.

14:54.674 --> 14:55.354
Next photograph.

14:55.715 --> 14:56.636
This is in Korea?

14:56.656 --> 14:57.637
Right.

14:58.057 --> 15:03.723
I don't know, some barracks sitting out under the barracks or someplace in Korea.

15:04.344 --> 15:09.489
That's the, if Norman Rockwell were to paint that picture, he'd call it the Lonely Soldier Project.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.710
He sure would.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.597
Just waiting for somebody to tell him what to do.

15:14.098 --> 15:14.699
That's true.

15:16.062 --> 15:17.044
That's what it looks like.

15:17.064 --> 15:19.410
And somebody came up and took his picture.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.294
Now, this was actually in Korea.

15:21.534 --> 15:27.889
Well, this was when I sat back in 1963 as an advisor to the Korean Army.

15:27.989 --> 15:28.530
I see.

15:28.510 --> 15:34.582
And this is one of the local civilians that we were down in Pusan.

15:34.602 --> 15:39.331
And so they had lots of pheasant at that time.

15:39.351 --> 15:40.894
This was 63, 64.

15:41.335 --> 15:45.744
And so this guy, we got to be friends.

15:45.824 --> 15:50.333
And we used to go pheasant hunting just about every weekend.

15:50.313 --> 15:52.721
What else is hanging there on the left side?

15:52.881 --> 15:53.824
It looks like a rabbit.

15:53.924 --> 15:56.332
Yeah, it looks like rabbits or foxes or something.

15:56.352 --> 15:57.837
I don't think it's a possum.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.281
Yeah, those are big rabbits.

15:59.301 --> 16:00.224
But it is a rabbit.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.652
Yeah, little rabbits too.

16:02.800 --> 16:11.836
And then they had a bunch of geese there, too, that would come down, like in January or February, and eat the rye that was planted in South Korea.

16:11.856 --> 16:14.982
And the Koreans didn't like that, so they wanted those killed out, too.

16:15.382 --> 16:17.927
Okay, let's move on.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.249
Tell us about this picture.

16:19.269 --> 16:23.076
You're on the right, and that tree is, tell us the story of that tree.

16:23.096 --> 16:25.200
Okay, that tree is named after me.

16:25.681 --> 16:25.821
Mm-hmm.

16:26.155 --> 16:46.418
My wife and I got involved with a local orphanage there in Tucson, and we had a number of money-raising campaigns to get them money to buy certain things, and we went out and visited them several times, and that's supposed to be a big honor if they name a tree after you.

16:46.879 --> 16:54.728
And this other guy on the left, he was my friend that was with me in Korea, and we

16:54.708 --> 16:56.931
We used to play golf together once in a while.

16:56.951 --> 16:58.393
That tree may be 60 feet tall.

16:58.493 --> 17:00.756
Yeah, it's old, that's for sure.

17:01.117 --> 17:03.059
If it's still alive, it's old.

17:04.841 --> 17:05.703
Okay, move on.

17:05.883 --> 17:06.684
Next picture.

17:06.704 --> 17:12.452
This is an article, I guess, in the Dallas newspaper about hometown boy making good.

17:12.492 --> 17:14.995
We're going to talk about your Vietnam experience.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.971
here in just a moment.

17:16.991 --> 17:22.820
And I believe this is the story when you were awarded the... This is the Legion of Merit.

17:22.840 --> 17:23.841
The Legion of Merit.

17:24.222 --> 17:28.488
You also received the Bronze Star Medal in Vietnam.

17:28.508 --> 17:31.492
And we'll talk in a little bit about the action where you earned that.

17:32.394 --> 17:35.037
But that's that photograph.

17:35.078 --> 17:35.899
Let's go on to the next one.

17:37.681 --> 17:43.049
And this picture of you and Louise is a great picture at a football game, right?

17:43.109 --> 17:43.750
1948.

17:44.472 --> 17:49.738
I don't know what ball game it was, but it had to be September, October, somewhere.

17:49.998 --> 17:50.299
Right.

17:50.419 --> 17:50.980
At Kyle Field?

17:51.380 --> 17:52.221
At Kyle Field.

17:52.241 --> 17:53.442
And look at the guys.

17:53.843 --> 17:56.086
The guy next to her, he's got a hat and a coat on.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.228
The guy behind him, he's got a coat and tie.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.210
And Louie's got her coat.

18:00.230 --> 18:01.672
Oh, yeah.

18:01.832 --> 18:02.853
Everybody dressed up.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.434
A big flower.

18:03.474 --> 18:04.575
Yeah, that was a big deal.

18:04.615 --> 18:05.957
Everybody dressed up.

18:06.342 --> 18:08.065
I wonder, those games in September.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.207
They were hot.

18:09.287 --> 18:10.208
I bet they were hot.

18:10.268 --> 18:13.153
I bet they were shucking those coats by halftime.

18:13.714 --> 18:14.916
I hope they were anyway.

18:14.956 --> 18:16.138
I don't think they do that anymore.

18:16.238 --> 18:18.001
I don't think they weren't coating ties to the game.

18:18.081 --> 18:19.904
She had on high heels at that ballgame.

18:19.924 --> 18:20.645
Oh, my goodness.

18:21.085 --> 18:24.551
No, they go pretty well dressed down nowadays.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.733
That's a great picture.

18:26.574 --> 18:28.878
Obviously, we fast-forwarded quite a bit.

18:28.958 --> 18:29.599
What's this?

18:29.579 --> 18:34.425
Well, I've been promoted to colonel, full colonel, and that's depending on the eagles there.

18:34.485 --> 18:34.845
Right.

18:35.847 --> 18:40.672
And that's a general on the right-hand side and my wife on the left-hand side.

18:40.893 --> 18:41.794
Right.

18:41.814 --> 18:43.556
Looks like she just lost the backing to one of them.

18:43.576 --> 18:44.116
Yeah, it does.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.138
She's looking for it.

18:45.178 --> 18:47.701
Looking for it.

18:48.802 --> 18:49.984
Okay, let's move on.

18:50.024 --> 18:52.987
There's a shot of a serious soldier right there.

18:54.189 --> 18:54.569
Yeah, I don't know.

18:54.589 --> 18:56.031
That was about the same time, I guess.

18:56.071 --> 18:57.412
Yeah, frame time.

18:57.473 --> 18:59.535
Frame time.

19:00.832 --> 19:02.534
That's probably Fort Lee, I'm guessing.

19:03.015 --> 19:09.805
Now, this is a little bit more to the present, and I've got this one up there because that is your son, Jim Jr., who is a minister in Arkansas, right?

19:09.825 --> 19:11.027
He's a minister in Arkansas, right.

19:11.688 --> 19:21.722
He graduated A&M in 85 and went into seminary at TCU in that same year, 85.

19:22.022 --> 19:28.011
I noted earlier how much I thought he looked in that picture, like the previous picture that we saw of you as an A&M cadet.

19:28.131 --> 19:28.712
Yeah, I don't think.

19:30.177 --> 19:31.098
He was a good golfer.

19:31.119 --> 19:32.881
We thought he was going to be.

19:32.901 --> 19:33.943
And there you are, the cover boy.

19:33.983 --> 19:40.494
We're going to talk a little bit later about your career in food services and food management and what a great career it has been.

19:40.514 --> 19:44.460
And this is you at a cover of a magazine for receiving an award, right?

19:44.480 --> 19:44.881
Right.

19:45.381 --> 19:46.243
It was a silver plate.

19:46.263 --> 19:51.091
It was an International Food Service Manufacturers Association Award.

19:51.772 --> 19:55.037
Stepping on your own private plane, which I'm sure you own, right?

19:55.017 --> 19:58.040
Because those food service people got paid a lot.

19:59.242 --> 19:59.662
I wish.

20:02.265 --> 20:04.307
Let's stay in Korea.

20:04.407 --> 20:13.357
I want you to talk about one particular time when you were sunbathing on a tank and you found yourself faced off with a North Korean tank.

20:14.017 --> 20:14.438
What happened?

20:14.538 --> 20:21.926
Well, that's when I was in the artillery and my battery commander, things were pretty quiet.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.888
He said, Jim, the things are quiet.

20:23.908 --> 20:24.889
Let's just go up.

20:25.156 --> 20:29.785
go out and jump in the Jeep and run up the front lines and see what's going on.

20:29.805 --> 20:37.761
So we went up into an area where there was an 81 millimeter mortar platoon and there was a tank there.

20:38.763 --> 20:43.232
And so the tank was, the North Koreans were

20:43.634 --> 20:45.657
We're about two miles on another hill.

20:45.697 --> 20:49.802
There's about a two mile no man land in the valley there.

20:49.822 --> 20:52.366
And these tanks have a telescopic site.

20:52.426 --> 20:56.231
So he had that telescopic site zeroed in on that other hill.

20:56.251 --> 21:00.798
And every time he saw movement over there, he fired a 90 millimeter round over there.

21:01.859 --> 21:06.666
So we climbed up on the tank and took our shirts off and actually were sunbathing.

21:08.007 --> 21:09.169
And this tank fired.

21:09.520 --> 21:17.949
I don't know, three or four shots, and then all of a sudden you hear this whining sound, you hear this incoming round, and so they started shooting back.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.432
They had mortar.

21:21.193 --> 21:29.902
We ended up in a mortar bombardment there, but anyway, I jumped off the tank, and I thought, well, maybe I'll get under the tank.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.346
I said, well, if I get under the tank, that guy's going to pull out, and he'll run over me.

21:33.366 --> 21:33.486
Right.

21:34.057 --> 21:37.681
So the only space that I found to get in was a garbage dump.

21:38.002 --> 21:39.643
So I dived into the garbage dump.

21:40.685 --> 21:43.247
And the battery commander found another place.

21:43.288 --> 21:46.511
He tried to get in the tank, but there wasn't enough room for him to get in the tank.

21:46.551 --> 21:51.116
So we finally worked our way out.

21:51.157 --> 21:56.282
And the way you work your way out is if there's two of you there, one of them listens for a mortar round coming in.

21:56.423 --> 22:01.228
And just before it explodes, you hit the dirt.

22:01.208 --> 22:09.249
And then as soon as it explodes, you get up and try to get, you rotate back and forth to taking time about that.

22:09.289 --> 22:11.775
So we got the heck out of there as soon as we could.

22:12.477 --> 22:13.159
I'll bet you did.

22:13.527 --> 22:16.450
I need to move along a little bit because I want to get you to Vietnam.

22:16.470 --> 22:21.054
You came home in February of 1952, went to Fort Lee, Virginia, quartermaster school.

22:21.535 --> 22:27.100
You got out in May of 53, and then you went to MIT to get a master's in food science.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.242
But the Army sent me to MIT.

22:29.362 --> 22:33.426
Army sent you to MIT, of course, and they paid for it, which was a good deal.

22:33.926 --> 22:36.609
MIT, obviously a great reputation as an academic school.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.671
You worked hard there to get that degree, didn't you?

22:38.691 --> 22:39.151
Yeah, very hard.

22:39.171 --> 22:39.892
And Louise helped you.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.273
Talk briefly about that.

22:42.012 --> 22:50.922
Well, Louise, there's a lot of lab work involved, and so I would dictate reports to her, and she would write my lab book.

22:51.643 --> 22:54.566
But we got into several arguments.

22:54.626 --> 22:59.472
It'd be about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I'd be dictated to her, and she'd be over asleep.

23:00.053 --> 23:02.015
And so I'd holler at her.

23:02.415 --> 23:10.905
And then at the very end of the second year, I was trying to finish up my thesis work, and this was in the summer of 55.

23:11.155 --> 23:23.386
She would go up to the lab and work to three or four o'clock in the morning, and I had to run a series of experiments, and I had to break down the experiment and reset it up.

23:23.446 --> 23:28.930
And when I had two sets of equipment, so she had washed one set while I was setting up the other set.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.892
So she helped me out tremendously.

23:30.912 --> 23:32.193
I couldn't have made it probably without her.

23:32.213 --> 23:34.135
You're going to have to fast forward a little bit.

23:34.155 --> 23:40.200
You were sent to Germany, a commissary officer there, then to Jacksonville, Florida, at a procurement base there.

23:40.771 --> 23:42.917
Move on to 1960, you have four children.

23:42.937 --> 23:45.784
You have orders back to Korea as an advisor.

23:45.804 --> 23:49.053
I think the picture that we saw a moment ago was when you were there.

23:49.073 --> 23:50.336
You had a very nice home there.

23:50.877 --> 23:56.552
Came home in 1965, back to Fort Lee, commissary assistant school, a battalion commander for six months.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.439
And then you got your orders to Vietnam.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.422
You went to Vietnam in March of 1968.

24:00.662 --> 24:04.989
This was an awfully, it was a hot spot obviously in 1968.

24:05.190 --> 24:14.625
Talk about your Vietnam experience and go ahead and get into the one particular experience that led to your commendation for the Bronze Star.

24:14.960 --> 24:21.626
Well, I got over there in March of 68, and that was just after the Tet Offensive.

24:21.646 --> 24:28.733
And then in May, they had their second Viet Cong offense.

24:29.414 --> 24:37.322
And so I was a depot commander, and I was on the, I guess it was probably like the north side of Saigon.

24:37.362 --> 24:39.163
It was out on a place called Cholon.

24:39.183 --> 24:41.946
But anyway, I was depot commander, and

24:41.926 --> 24:50.074
So one morning we wake up and here come the Viet Cong streaming down the roads and they were coming.

24:50.915 --> 24:58.022
On one side of me they were coming down our depot side and we had, thank goodness, we had a brick wall there.

24:58.042 --> 25:08.052
But the gunships were called in and they were rocketing the Viet Cong and it set a big fire.

25:08.318 --> 25:19.073
And in that particular corner where the fire was, we had about, oh, I don't know, probably 40 or 50, 55 gallon drums of gasoline.

25:19.094 --> 25:26.624
So I asked for volunteers from our enlisted men and we started moving.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.487
Well, I went back to my old

25:28.467 --> 25:54.728
training infantry infantry training and we set down a base of fire and and we then came under a snapper fire and we set down at the base of fire to keep the snapper busy while we were trying to move the gasoline and we eventually moved the gasoline and then things got pretty hot and we I said well we decided we needed some help so I radioed for

25:54.708 --> 26:00.502
for some help and they sent in a combat platoon of the 25th Infantry Division.

26:00.522 --> 26:04.853
And then we had, he had, it was a young lieutenant,

26:05.322 --> 26:10.712
It probably hadn't been in the Army too long, but he had a really excellent sergeant, a platoon sergeant.

26:10.732 --> 26:22.793
The platoon sergeant came in and really sort of took charge of what was going on, and the lieutenant took a patrol outside of the compound, and he came under sniper fire.

26:23.815 --> 26:27.702
So the sergeant had a 90-millimeter rifle,

26:28.559 --> 26:35.510
And they're not supposed to fire those things unless you get permission from higher headquarters.

26:36.792 --> 26:41.580
But with this kid and his patrol under sniper fire, he climbed up on top of the building.

26:41.620 --> 26:42.661
I said, well, go ahead and fire it.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.664
If anything happens, I'll take all the blame for it.

26:45.546 --> 26:49.933
So he let off a couple of rounds and dispersed the snipers anyway.

26:50.033 --> 26:53.318
And so none of our guys got hit or got hurt.

26:53.635 --> 26:56.838
Jim, we're almost out of time, and you won that accommodation for that.

26:56.859 --> 26:57.920
Yeah, we're almost out of time.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.782
It goes so quickly.

27:00.082 --> 27:15.439
Didn't have time to talk about your 13 years with the state of Texas mental health and retardation in food services and your wonderful career in food services and coming back to Texas A&M.

27:15.899 --> 27:17.721
But it was a great service.

27:17.801 --> 27:21.145
And again, I'm sorry we're out of time, but I want to thank you very much for your service.
