00:29.553 --> 00:31.807
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.827 --> 00:32.788
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.815 --> 00:37.999
October the 18th to the 29th, 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:38.459 --> 00:44.125
Claude Mounce saw it up close and personal, but he'll tell you that at the time, he had no idea it was such a big deal.

00:44.846 --> 00:51.953
As a pilot off a carrier that was part of the blockade, it was his job to fly the photographers to where the Russian ships were approaching.

00:51.973 --> 01:02.843
Photos were taken, sent back to Washington, where President John F. Kennedy and his military advisors were convinced that the Soviets were planning to stockpile warhead missiles to their bases in Cuba.

01:03.245 --> 01:06.270
It became one of the most critical political standoffs in our history.

01:06.770 --> 01:12.379
That was just part of a remarkable quarter century of military service by Naval Commander Claude Mounce.

01:12.399 --> 01:18.308
Today, Claude and his wife, Clara, live south of Welburn, and it's an honor to have him on Veterans of the Valley.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.253
Claude, it really is an honor, and thank you for being here with us.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.356
Let's talk about the early years of Claude Mounce.

01:23.376 --> 01:26.180
You were raised in a little town called McLean up in the Panhandle.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.846
Went off at age 16 and went to that university down in Austin, the UT.

01:30.926 --> 01:34.391
Sort of take us from there and talk about how that led to your naval career.

01:34.631 --> 01:42.082
If I'd had enough money for a round trip bus ticket, I would have gone on back home because coming to a school that had 20,000 students was something else.

01:42.863 --> 01:44.545
Anyway, I joined the ROTC.

01:45.446 --> 01:46.668
I got my degree in journalism.

01:47.669 --> 01:50.413
When I went back my senior year, they said either

01:50.478 --> 01:55.124
sign up for active duty or we're gonna make you eligible for the draft.

01:55.144 --> 01:57.147
So I signed up for active duty.

01:57.888 --> 02:02.895
I also signed up for flight training, but they, in those days they sent you to a ship for a year.

02:04.276 --> 02:09.904
And so I went to a gasoline tanker in the Mediterranean and that was something else.

02:09.884 --> 02:26.543
But I went through flight school, and I soloed down in Pensacola on my birthday in 1953, and then I did six carrier landings on the USS Monterey on December the 7th of 1953.

02:27.805 --> 02:33.492
And I was a lover, not a fighter, so I didn't want to be a big single-engine aircraft driver.

02:34.334 --> 02:42.885
So I opted for the four-engine airplanes and got my wings, was sent to a squadron flying B-26s towing targets.

02:42.905 --> 02:43.746
So I was shot at.

02:44.667 --> 02:49.474
It just stood, hopefully, they were 5,000 feet behind us when the shells exploded.

02:50.255 --> 02:53.038
But anyway, we spent some time in Japan flying a B-26.

02:54.620 --> 02:57.424
Later on, we transitioned to the F-9, F-5.

02:58.130 --> 03:06.501
and they had no one else to fly them, so they sent me back to justice school and went to a sister squadron to learn how to fly the jets.

03:07.662 --> 03:15.272
And of course, those days they didn't have dual pilot aircraft, they just let you read the book and put you in the airplane the way you went.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.235
And that's what I did.

03:18.194 --> 03:29.929
After I landed the first time, I decided to start smoking again because it was a pretty hairy experience to be up there and not have to worry about everything, you know, changing the prop and all this sort of stuff.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.178
I spent a couple of years in Japan.

03:36.438 --> 03:38.641
I was a bachelor.

03:38.681 --> 03:39.782
I got to travel a lot.

03:39.842 --> 03:44.168
I went to Iwo Jima and Okinawa and the Philippines and

03:45.852 --> 03:48.356
Flew some targets for the Republic of Korea.

03:50.098 --> 03:52.662
They weren't very good shots either.

03:53.743 --> 03:55.926
I came back and got married in San Diego.

03:57.929 --> 04:00.913
Went to postgraduate school up in Monterey.

04:03.056 --> 04:05.700
Went to Mayport.

04:06.608 --> 04:09.552
I was in the communications officer at Mayport for a couple of years.

04:10.794 --> 04:16.842
And then the Navy, for some reason or other, decided they need some single-engine carrier pilots, so they selected me.

04:17.944 --> 04:21.669
And I went up to Quonset Point and learned how to fly a single-engine airplane.

04:21.689 --> 04:29.300
But I was not by myself because there was a blimp pilot there, too, who transitioned over into ADs.

04:30.241 --> 04:34.287
But I got qualified, had a problem qualifying.

04:35.026 --> 04:36.708
because airplanes kept running into each other.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.433
Outside of that, it was a very uneventful career.

04:41.274 --> 04:48.324
We used to go out on the WASP and spend a month or so on ASW exercises.

04:49.225 --> 04:50.767
That was the USS WASP, right?

04:50.787 --> 04:51.488
That was the carrier.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.609
On the USS WASP, on the carrier.

04:52.709 --> 04:57.476
And the problem with that was that she was based in Boston, we were based in Quonset.

04:57.836 --> 04:58.217
Right.

04:58.237 --> 05:04.405
And so we always had to fly out to the ship, whereas most carriers were based at an airfield and you loaded the aircraft on.

05:04.425 --> 05:04.645
Right.

05:04.979 --> 05:12.589
It was the USS Wasp, I believe, is where you flew off of, what we were referred to during the, what we refer to now as the Cuban Missile Crisis.

05:12.609 --> 05:12.989
Oh, yeah.

05:13.190 --> 05:14.131
Yeah.

05:14.291 --> 05:20.900
Talk about that, because when people think about history, they think about that part of history of John F. Kennedy's administration.

05:21.440 --> 05:27.909
You all didn't know it was such a big deal, but talk specifically about what the job was there and how it was.

05:28.049 --> 05:32.615
All of a sudden, in a couple of days, we knew that there was a crisis of some sort.

05:32.635 --> 05:32.775
Mm-hmm.

05:33.194 --> 05:36.498
In a couple of days, they sent an alert out to us.

05:36.518 --> 05:40.663
And we were due to go on the ship in about a week, but they decided to send us out early.

05:41.544 --> 05:46.230
And then somebody said, well, we ought to put some guns on the airplane.

05:46.250 --> 05:51.457
And that had been ridiculous because we hadn't fired a gun in anger in many years.

05:51.477 --> 05:56.643
But anyway, they sent us down to get to Cuba.

05:58.045 --> 06:00.788
Actually, we were about 200 miles north of Cuba.

06:02.050 --> 06:11.962
And we had a squadron of helicopters, two squadrons of S2Fs, and a detachment of four ADs, and I was the officer in charge.

06:13.284 --> 06:22.595
And what we'd do is we would fly out and search a couple hundred miles around the ship to find these ships that would look like they were carrying big, long tubes.

06:24.077 --> 06:31.045
And if we found one, we would either vector an airplane to come in and take a picture of it, or we would go down and take a picture ourselves.

06:31.987 --> 06:40.959
And if the skipper thought that it was appropriate, he would send out a helicopter with a Russian speaking translator.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.504
And they would hover over it and speak to the captain in Russian.

06:46.066 --> 06:47.347
And of course, there was the usual things.

06:47.387 --> 06:51.573
They traded golden wings for, I don't know, whatever it was.

06:52.514 --> 06:59.243
And the gist of the matter was that we spent about three weeks doing this, looking for ships.

06:59.695 --> 07:04.581
We found probably a dozen, took pictures of all of them.

07:04.682 --> 07:13.814
It was a real thrill to fly down alongside a ship at 300 feet and let your observer take the picture.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.656
But we didn't know what happened to the pictures.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.879
And of course, there was no radio broadcasts.

07:17.899 --> 07:21.223
There were no radios allowed on the ship.

07:21.243 --> 07:22.485
You couldn't have personal cameras.

07:23.286 --> 07:25.529
So we didn't know what the hell was going on.

07:25.549 --> 07:28.673
But we flew around the clock for about three weeks.

07:30.003 --> 07:36.290
And finally, for some reason or other, somebody said the Russians had decided to take their missiles and go back home.

07:38.352 --> 07:41.395
And so if that happened, they said, well, we don't have to fly anymore.

07:42.296 --> 07:46.600
So we took a couple of days rest coming back up to Norfolk or to Quonset Point.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.205
And then they let us fly off and go into Quonset.

07:51.225 --> 07:51.986
And that was the end of it.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.188
You know, it was reluctant heroes is what we were.

07:54.657 --> 07:55.839
And no idea that you were part of?

07:55.959 --> 07:57.401
We didn't know what the hell was happening.

07:57.741 --> 08:01.466
Yeah, part of something that would become history and that Hollywood would make movies out of.

08:01.486 --> 08:02.528
Well, we didn't know.

08:02.848 --> 08:03.729
We just did our job.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.333
We got pretty tired of doing it over and over and over again.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.194
Right.

08:07.214 --> 08:10.138
But just one of those things.

08:10.339 --> 08:10.819
Right.

08:10.839 --> 08:13.403
Let's go back to when you first started flying.

08:13.463 --> 08:16.727
There were some pretty eventful and adventurous times there.

08:16.787 --> 08:22.335
I know that you talked about when you told me one time that you

08:22.653 --> 08:27.999
and you were supposed to have somebody flying off, flying beside you, but they aborted and you were up there by yourself.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.962
Well, that was when I was learning how to fly the jets.

08:30.182 --> 08:30.863
Right.

08:30.883 --> 08:35.989
Because they didn't have two people in the same airplane, they let two airplanes take off at the same time.

08:37.210 --> 08:42.557
And we were on the runway and we started taking off and the guy who was supposed to be my instructor aborted.

08:43.438 --> 08:49.605
So I wound up at 20,000 feet over San Diego with a big circle of about, I don't know, 30 miles in diameter.

08:50.632 --> 08:54.538
And sometimes I was out over Mexico, and sometimes I was out over the Pacific Ocean.

08:54.578 --> 08:58.604
And the red light came on, and they said when the red light comes on, you land.

08:58.644 --> 09:02.169
If there are two red lights come on, you bail out.

09:02.189 --> 09:06.997
So I came down to land, and nobody said anything about taking the throttle off.

09:07.017 --> 09:09.300
In fact, I was afraid a fire would go out.

09:10.201 --> 09:15.930
But I used back on a throttle just a little bit, and I came across a field at 300 or 400 knots.

09:16.636 --> 09:18.939
Well, when I turned, I wound up in Mexico.

09:19.019 --> 09:22.865
And when I came back, the runway was sitting way over here.

09:22.885 --> 09:24.928
And the fuel was getting lower and lower.

09:24.948 --> 09:27.251
And so I slowed down finally and came around and made one land.

09:27.491 --> 09:29.033
I had 400 pounds of fuel left.

09:29.955 --> 09:37.025
And when I got into the chocks, well, I had the plane captain give me a cigarette because it was a harrying experience.

09:37.045 --> 09:39.468
And the guy kept saying, I'll find you, I'll find you.

09:39.488 --> 09:41.170
But he never did find me while I was in the air.

09:41.451 --> 09:41.631
Right.

09:42.303 --> 09:51.055
So anyway, from then on, they sent me over to El Centro, and I towed targets over the Chocolate Drop Mountains for the attack squadrons.

09:51.075 --> 10:00.368
And we'd take off in the F-9 and drag a target behind us and get up to 20,000 feet and let the guys shoot at us.

10:00.388 --> 10:01.350
And then we'd come back and drop it.

10:01.390 --> 10:04.214
What were the targets?

10:04.234 --> 10:10.943
It was a big piece of metal about six feet long and had a banner on it about 30 feet long with wire mesh in it.

10:11.328 --> 10:13.672
So the radar could pick it up.

10:13.692 --> 10:16.736
And the airplanes had different colored tips on the bullets.

10:16.756 --> 10:19.761
And so they'd shoot at it, and then we'd come back and drop it over the field.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.784
We had what they call a daisy cutter.

10:21.804 --> 10:26.372
You put it on the cable, and it just comes back and slices it off.

10:27.253 --> 10:30.638
And the banner drops, and they decide who shot it and who didn't.

10:30.778 --> 10:31.680
They were lousy shots.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.142
They'd grade the targets.

10:33.162 --> 10:34.104
They didn't do very well.

10:34.204 --> 10:37.088
And they were towed about how far behind the aircraft?

10:37.108 --> 10:38.310
2,000 feet.

10:38.350 --> 10:38.871
2,000 feet.

10:39.374 --> 10:42.319
So for you to be in danger, they'd have to be a really bad shot.

10:42.339 --> 10:53.560
If you're flying along like this and the guy turns and he's got a loaded gun, you don't know whether he's going to turn all the way to the target and shoot or whether he's going to start shooting early and shoot at you.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.223
Right.

10:56.570 --> 10:57.652
I was young and foolish.

10:58.172 --> 10:59.214
It didn't make any difference to me.

10:59.254 --> 11:00.296
Nobody was going to hurt me.

11:00.316 --> 11:01.958
You just didn't want to become the target.

11:02.459 --> 11:03.741
Or you didn't want to get in the way of the target.

11:03.761 --> 11:06.285
Nobody was going to shoot at me, not good old Claudio Boy.

11:06.826 --> 11:08.569
I mean, he was a good kid.

11:08.629 --> 11:09.831
He wasn't going to get in the way.

11:09.871 --> 11:11.754
Nobody was going to mess with you.

11:11.774 --> 11:13.356
No, no.

11:13.376 --> 11:18.544
Your diverse career then later included a stint at the Pentagon during the

11:18.743 --> 11:20.045
the height of the Vietnam War.

11:20.105 --> 11:25.152
As a matter of fact, I want you to talk about that, your job as a public relations type job at the Pentagon.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.034
Talk about that and what that involved.

11:27.054 --> 11:34.504
Okay, after I went to Boston University and got my master's, the Navy said you had to pay back for the time you spent in school.

11:34.524 --> 11:40.172
So they sent me to Department of Defense, and I worked for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs.

11:41.113 --> 11:45.679
A guy by the name of Sylvester, Arthur Sylvester.

11:46.216 --> 11:48.619
McNamara was a Department of Defense commander.

11:49.960 --> 11:56.087
And he said, if you get a three year tour of duty in Department of Defense, you can't go to Vietnam.

11:56.107 --> 12:02.894
And of course, we were all volunteering for Vietnam because if you got your ticket punched, that means you're going to get a promotion right away.

12:03.114 --> 12:05.437
And I got my promotion instead.

12:05.457 --> 12:14.046
But anyway, while I was there, the peace march or the anti-war people came in and they took over the Pentagon.

12:14.330 --> 12:18.476
And we had troops stationed in our quarters in the Pentagon.

12:19.437 --> 12:24.484
And they told us not to come to work for a week, so we didn't.

12:24.504 --> 12:27.929
And we don't know what happened, but the place was a shambles after we came back to work.

12:28.730 --> 12:32.375
Empty beer cans all over the place and cigarette butts all over the place.

12:33.236 --> 12:34.718
It was pretty much a mess.

12:34.738 --> 12:36.440
And you were in the public relations department.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.183
So I guess after you got back, there was work to do.

12:38.283 --> 12:39.084
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:39.244 --> 12:43.170
But anyway, for the public relations, we dealt mostly with veterans organizations.

12:43.330 --> 12:43.510
Right.

12:43.895 --> 12:53.031
We dealt with the VFW, the American Legion, the DAV, the Paralyzed Vets, and I think it was called the Vietnam Veterans of America.

12:54.012 --> 12:57.338
But we were involved in all their conferences.

12:57.358 --> 12:59.201
We answered all their questions.

12:59.221 --> 13:04.290
If we couldn't answer the question, we'd farm it out to the Army or Navy or Marines and then send the answer to them.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.135
And it was a delightful three years, but...

13:08.178 --> 13:10.040
I don't know that I accomplished a heck of a lot.

13:10.100 --> 13:14.263
So I paid them off for the year I spent in Boston, which was desirable.

13:14.283 --> 13:15.865
I mean, that was a nice tour of duty.

13:16.065 --> 13:20.068
Now from 66 to 69, the veterans you dealt with, I guess, were mostly World War II.

13:20.148 --> 13:24.092
I guess there were still a few World War I veterans around at that time also.

13:24.112 --> 13:31.898
A few still alive then, and very few Vietnam or Korean veterans because they just, they weren't joiners like the old timers were.

13:32.119 --> 13:33.240
Right.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.223
And those are all dying off, of course, the World War I

13:37.456 --> 13:39.800
And World War II are dying off.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.962
Exactly.

13:40.982 --> 13:42.083
We've got more to talk about.

13:42.103 --> 13:44.648
I want to talk about carrier landings.

13:45.549 --> 13:51.178
I think you've made over 500 of those, and every one of them were critical ones.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.100
Every one of them was hairy.

13:52.861 --> 14:04.780
But first, before we do that, I want to go to some photographs that Claude Mounce has supplied to us from his military duty, and even earlier, as a matter of fact, if we can go to some of those photographs.

14:05.249 --> 14:07.333
Here we've got a smaller picture.

14:07.834 --> 14:11.682
This is you and your youth with your siblings, right?

14:11.942 --> 14:17.012
This is me and my three brothers, and we all were in the military in some way or another.

14:17.032 --> 14:20.799
Oldest brother, Bill, was a parachutist and a ranger.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.803
I mean, he was big on the whole thing.

14:23.505 --> 14:24.346
I was in the Navy.

14:24.487 --> 14:27.192
Clyde was a bombardier navigator.

14:27.212 --> 14:27.713
In fact,

14:28.435 --> 14:36.509
He was to kid him because the Air Force gave him a letter of commendation for shooting all the guns on a B-36 at 20,000 feet.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.853
Usually they froze up or something happened.

14:38.873 --> 14:43.721
Anyway, and Jerry was in the National Guard for 25 or 30 years.

14:43.861 --> 14:44.943
Now, which one is young Claude?

14:45.945 --> 14:48.069
He's the second one.

14:48.089 --> 14:49.511
He's the second eldest.

14:49.531 --> 14:50.853
Okay, so in the back?

14:51.314 --> 14:51.915
In the back, yeah.

14:51.935 --> 14:52.336
Back left?

14:52.737 --> 14:52.977
Yeah.

14:53.157 --> 14:53.498
Okay.

14:54.322 --> 14:55.104
All right, let's move on.

14:55.124 --> 14:56.167
I think we get you there.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.755
Here's a photograph of you at the University of Texas.

14:58.795 --> 14:59.878
I was at the university.

14:59.918 --> 15:03.267
That was my NROTC uniform.

15:03.287 --> 15:05.293
My brother Clyde was with me for a while.

15:05.678 --> 15:07.400
And then he dropped out and joined the Air Force.

15:08.281 --> 15:12.487
But that's me and all my uniform regalia.

15:12.707 --> 15:13.968
Good-looking soldier.

15:13.988 --> 15:14.830
Oh, yeah.

15:14.850 --> 15:15.450
All right.

15:15.470 --> 15:16.732
That's the day I soloed.

15:17.072 --> 15:18.214
This is the SNJ.

15:18.254 --> 15:20.977
We referred to it as a secret Navy jet.

15:21.618 --> 15:22.820
But it was a training airplane.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.622
The Air Force called it a T-6.

15:25.403 --> 15:26.584
It was a big airplane.

15:26.624 --> 15:29.728
It had 700 horsepower engine.

15:29.748 --> 15:32.031
And this was the day that I soloed.

15:32.772 --> 15:35.095
And it was a little unnerving because they made you put a...

15:35.648 --> 15:44.958
100-pound sack of sand in the back and tie it in with the safety belts because the balance was such that you usually fly with an instructor.

15:45.779 --> 15:52.686
But anyway, I went out and shot three landings at a field where you're supposed to be dual pilots with an instructor before I realized what was happening.

15:52.726 --> 15:57.452
And nobody noticed anything, so I got the hell out of there in a hurry.

15:57.472 --> 16:00.455
But I was safe enough to fly, so nothing to it.

16:01.276 --> 16:02.517
OK, move on.

16:03.965 --> 16:05.928
Oh yeah, there's the F9, F5s.

16:07.189 --> 16:11.094
And they took a target and attached it to the speed brakes underneath.

16:11.114 --> 16:15.741
Speed brakes came up, but knotted a big hunk of canvas there.

16:16.542 --> 16:26.795
Attached the cable to the target in the back and you took off and you take off and you level off at a thousand feet and the target would just fly right up after you.

16:26.815 --> 16:31.862
And we went out off the Sea of Japan and let the Navy guys and Marines shoot at us.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.812
And that's a single-seater right there.

16:33.832 --> 16:35.194
That's a single-seater, yeah.

16:35.755 --> 16:46.833
It was nice, though, because when the weather was cold, you'd close off that canopy, and as you're going down the runway, snow starts coming out of the air vents, and that really cools you off in a hurry.

16:46.853 --> 16:48.716
That's a lot of metal underneath your seat.

16:48.836 --> 16:57.089
And if you're a little bit hungover, you can turn the oxygen on up 100%, that'll sober you up in a hurry.

16:57.109 --> 17:00.094
I never did that, but that's what the big boys told me.

17:00.277 --> 17:01.860
This picture is on your wall at your home.

17:01.940 --> 17:02.581
Talk about that.

17:02.842 --> 17:03.263
Oh, yeah.

17:03.283 --> 17:03.523
Okay.

17:03.543 --> 17:05.807
These are the Sky Raiders.

17:06.930 --> 17:09.394
This squadron had two different kinds of airplanes.

17:09.414 --> 17:13.582
This one was the Sky Raider that had the electronic countermeasures on it.

17:13.602 --> 17:18.912
They had jammers and they had chaff dispensers and all sorts of things.

17:18.932 --> 17:20.435
And they operated off the big carriers.

17:21.397 --> 17:22.639
And the airplane that I flew,

17:24.172 --> 17:32.971
had a big guppy antenna on a belly and had the capability of sending the radar signal from the airplane back to the carrier.

17:32.991 --> 17:42.872
So we could be 200 miles away from the carrier and the carrier could turn its radar off and use our radar to hunt for the enemy or whatever it is they were hunting.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.266
Now, were these the planes that you used during the Cuban situation?

17:47.286 --> 17:48.288
They were similar, yeah.

17:48.308 --> 17:48.569
Okay.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.497
So each one of those were four-seaters, is that right?

17:51.517 --> 17:52.500
Those are four-seaters.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.405
The ones we flew in were three-seaters.

17:54.485 --> 17:55.066
I see.

17:55.768 --> 17:57.553
Two in front, one in back, the guy.

17:58.107 --> 17:59.629
twiddling the black knobs in the back.

17:59.649 --> 18:02.273
And I believe in that picture, you're number two there.

18:02.453 --> 18:03.194
Number two, yeah.

18:04.135 --> 18:07.060
We maneuvered a lot to get that lined up.

18:07.580 --> 18:14.470
Because a photo plane was an airplane that would only do 160 knots straight down.

18:15.351 --> 18:20.498
So we had to get that thing going straight, coming over and taking a picture at the same time.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.301
It was a little difficult.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.604
All right, let's move on.

18:25.681 --> 18:26.742
When was this taken?

18:26.762 --> 18:42.744
Okay, this was the official roster photo that was taken to put in the War College little bulletin that they put out so that the instructors knew who everybody was, and everybody that went to War College got a copy of it so you know who they were.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.048
Good-looking airman there.

18:46.068 --> 18:46.829
Yeah, used to be.

18:47.030 --> 18:47.310
Yeah.

18:47.530 --> 18:49.373
Now, I put this in because you were proud of it.

18:49.393 --> 18:52.717
You sent it to me, and so I wanted to share it with people.

18:52.737 --> 18:53.258
That's a...

18:53.525 --> 18:58.191
When I retired, one of my big things was to buy a Rolls Royce.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.154
And I not only bought one, I bought two.

19:02.415 --> 19:03.597
And everything was going fine.

19:03.657 --> 19:05.039
I sold one of them, the 67.

19:06.520 --> 19:15.431
And the 73, though, was, I hate to say it, but an Aggie student ran a red light and broadsided me.

19:15.451 --> 19:16.352
Oh, no.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.313
And took care of that.

19:17.854 --> 19:18.975
That's tough for you and him.

19:19.057 --> 19:22.442
Yeah, the only real problem was that we both had insurance with the same company.

19:23.564 --> 19:29.452
So when I go to put my claim in, who's the company going to fight for?

19:30.113 --> 19:30.674
Not for me.

19:32.737 --> 19:33.498
Well, those are beauties.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.141
Indeed.

19:36.723 --> 19:44.014
You had a three-month tour, if it were, with a squadron that was disbanded quite quickly in 1970, I believe.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.656
That was a real disappointment.

19:46.297 --> 19:47.679
We went back to Quonset Point.

19:47.699 --> 19:48.861
It was the same squadron.

19:50.309 --> 19:51.471
I was the executive officer.

19:52.273 --> 19:53.214
We bought a house.

19:53.315 --> 19:54.497
We put the kids in school.

19:54.897 --> 19:56.020
We bought the kids a horse.

19:56.561 --> 19:58.544
And three months later, they disbanded the squadron.

19:59.185 --> 20:00.428
Got rid of all the airplanes.

20:00.708 --> 20:01.650
Got rid of all the people.

20:02.311 --> 20:06.178
There were 15 of us that were sent down to Norfolk to form a new support group.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.326
And we had a B-47 under contract.

20:11.268 --> 20:16.818
And we had some what they call BMQs or missiles that they sling under the B-47.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.463
We had a super constellation.

20:19.563 --> 20:21.186
We had some F-4s.

20:21.207 --> 20:23.190
We had some A-4s.

20:23.210 --> 20:24.132
We had an A-3D.

20:24.994 --> 20:29.382
And we would go out and simulate missiles down at Rosie Rhodes Training.

20:30.544 --> 20:33.850
Simulate missiles coming in to hit the fleet.

20:34.690 --> 20:38.535
And on their three lines of defense against missiles, they never did get us.

20:39.537 --> 20:41.219
So things were really, really bad.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.401
I mean, it's a bad situation.

20:42.561 --> 20:43.903
Yes, sir.

20:43.923 --> 20:50.112
And I left because I had a vertebra taken out of my neck and my flying career was over with.

20:50.953 --> 20:57.743
But you wonder, whatever happened, did they ever learn how to shoot down the missiles?

20:57.863 --> 20:58.984
Did they ever learn how to catch them?

20:59.585 --> 20:59.705
Right.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.847
And you hope that they did.

21:01.027 --> 21:01.508
Exactly.

21:01.893 --> 21:07.621
because otherwise we're in bad trouble if a missile comes towards us.

21:07.641 --> 21:21.883
Claude, you spent six years in Italy, and I want to get back to that as we have time, but I want to talk about carrier landings, of which you believe you have 531 of them, and you said that every one of them was critical, was scary.

21:22.163 --> 21:26.970
There are people in the Navy who are liars, and then there's damn liars.

21:28.232 --> 21:31.697
They're the people who lie about how there's nothing to land on a carrier.

21:32.842 --> 21:40.531
Because it was, I mean, you get about 10 seconds from the time you get out there close to the carrier until you land.

21:40.551 --> 21:42.474
And that's when you have to fly the airplane critically.

21:43.615 --> 21:47.480
And you remember you're doing it yourself because you see a ball there.

21:47.500 --> 21:52.185
And if the ball is above the datum line, that means you're high and you got to get a little bit low.

21:52.205 --> 21:54.368
And if you're low, you've got to pull back.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.050
And there's an LSO out there.

21:56.070 --> 22:01.937
He may say something to you, but he'll normally flash a green light if you're ready to land or red light.

22:02.643 --> 22:03.284
to wave off.

22:04.885 --> 22:11.892
Unfortunately, the first time I went out to land, we'd practice with the light on the left side.

22:11.912 --> 22:14.195
And I went to land on the wasp, and it was on the right side.

22:15.136 --> 22:16.257
And I kept looking for it.

22:17.698 --> 22:22.883
And finally, I found it over on the right side, but I kept trying to fly into the light.

22:22.903 --> 22:30.031
And so they criticized me for landing off the center line by about five feet, because you're supposed to land right on the center.

22:30.051 --> 22:32.413
But I finally got the knack of that gradually.

22:32.613 --> 22:36.698
You know, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but they did in this case.

22:37.438 --> 22:45.427
Anyway, nowadays, I'm drawing retired pay in Social Security, and they're paying me back for all those carrier landings.

22:46.048 --> 22:49.011
Because I figured they paid about $2 a landing.

22:49.612 --> 22:52.255
Now, the squadrons that I was in were all night squadrons.

22:52.275 --> 22:55.639
That meant night takeoffs and night landings.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.502
And for a while, we did night...

22:59.039 --> 23:00.201
Deck runs.

23:00.741 --> 23:03.225
Get us back 600 feet and turn us loose and let us go.

23:04.366 --> 23:07.311
Finally, they decided to put us on the catapult, but the airplane was critical.

23:08.552 --> 23:16.564
If the wind was not within six degrees of the way the plane was facing, it was dangerous to get a cat shot.

23:16.584 --> 23:25.436
And I got a cat shot that... The way you signal you're ready at nighttime is flip a light switch.

23:26.377 --> 23:28.320
Okay, I flipped it and the guy didn't make any movement.

23:28.942 --> 23:56.080
I thought well I didn't hit it so I looked over and went to hit it again. Then he fired at me. Well my head went back, and I thought I was turning to the left at night time, black pitch night, but I wasn't. I was going straight. Well you get vertigo and you don't know what you're supposed to do other than what the instructor said believe your instruments. You watch that little airplane. Right. It's going straight then everything's straight even though it looks like you're flying like that.

23:57.916 --> 24:02.989
That's quite a trust in those instruments when your body is telling you you might be going in.

24:03.069 --> 24:03.591
Yeah, you're right.

24:03.972 --> 24:05.977
But that little airplane is telling you you're okay.

24:06.117 --> 24:10.609
Ten minutes later, you know, you finally... You wish you had some clean underwear.

24:12.310 --> 24:15.037
And then of course coming back for the night landing, it's the same thing.

24:15.819 --> 24:21.452
You sit out there 20 miles from the ship and you have to get exactly in sync with the rest of them.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.161
And since we were single engine, they let us come in first.

24:25.181 --> 24:29.492
So if we missed it the first time, we get a chance to come around before we ran out of fuel.

24:29.472 --> 24:32.435
From 71 to 77, I want to touch on this.

24:32.475 --> 24:34.658
You were in Naples, Italy as part of the NATO staff.

24:35.339 --> 24:36.880
Talk about what your job was there.

24:36.901 --> 24:38.082
Okay.

24:38.142 --> 24:41.826
The Navy was undergoing some money problems.

24:42.407 --> 24:45.911
So if they put somebody in a job, they decided to keep them there for a while.

24:45.931 --> 24:49.255
So I actually spent six years there instead of the two or three year tour.

24:50.296 --> 24:55.682
But at the end, I was in charge of all the special weapons, which are nuclear weapons,

24:56.725 --> 25:02.334
through the entire Mediterranean for Italy, Greece, and Turkey, and the British at Malta.

25:03.896 --> 25:09.706
I was also in charge of what they call the atomic demolition munitions.

25:09.726 --> 25:24.589
They had huge holes drilled in certain strategic locations in Greece and Turkey that they were going to lower these atomic devices down into and set them off in case the horde, the enemy, came and tried to advance through the country.

25:25.193 --> 25:29.760
And there were vital passes that were going to close it off for some reason or other.

25:29.780 --> 25:34.188
But I was in charge of making sure that we had them, that the plans were up to date.

25:34.749 --> 25:37.193
And I went and checked every one of them once a year.

25:38.074 --> 25:39.697
So I did a lot of traveling.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.620
And they were all safe.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.062
Indeed.

25:43.563 --> 25:46.247
You retired in 1977 as a commander.

25:46.708 --> 25:51.015
And you brought your daughter to A&M to go to vet school.

25:51.856 --> 26:14.910
and you needed you wanted to take care of that so you stayed here and been here ever since. She was 17 years old she barely spoke English. She could speak real good Italian right. No room at the dorm so I wasn't about to turn her loose in an apartment all by herself and moved to Virginia and retire, so my wife and I took a job here or took an apartment here and my wife went down to the Bryan Library to ask about

26:15.802 --> 26:23.151
professional magazines since she had gotten her degree from URI before we went to NAPA.

26:24.092 --> 26:26.054
And they said, are you looking for a job?

26:26.095 --> 26:28.237
And she said, well, I guess so.

26:28.257 --> 26:29.899
And two weeks later, she was hired.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.281
She's been there ever since.

26:31.301 --> 26:32.022
Indeed she has.

26:32.042 --> 26:35.146
I've been trying to talk her into retiring, but no success.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.309
A lot of people in this community know Clara, your wife.

26:38.390 --> 26:42.495
And you all, this January, I believe, will celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary.

26:42.515 --> 26:43.716
Congratulations.

26:44.017 --> 26:57.688
On that, and you have three degrees from University of Texas, that was your first one, in journalism, in public relations at Boston University, and then came to Texas A&M and got a degree in ag engineering and taught for 15 years, is that right?

26:58.748 --> 27:01.272
Congratulations on a wonderful career and thank you for your service.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.154
I wish we had more time, but we're out of time.

27:03.174 --> 27:03.555
It's all right.

27:03.615 --> 27:05.578
I can tell lies anytime.

27:05.598 --> 27:06.659
Thank you, Claude.

27:06.679 --> 27:12.568
He's the first to tell you that he did not serve in harm's way, but his service to our country makes us safer every day.

27:12.968 --> 27:16.133
Claude Mounce was a part of a historical event

27:16.113 --> 27:18.576
And he didn't even realize it at the time.

27:18.596 --> 27:21.459
But now he's a proud citizen and veteran of the Brazos Valley.

27:21.859 --> 27:28.626
We thank Commander Claude Mounce for his service to our country and to Clara Mounce for her longtime service as our chief librarian.

27:28.646 --> 27:31.269
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:31.289 --> 27:37.556
And you can read more stories of Brazos Valley veterans in Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:37.576 --> 27:39.357
I'm Tom Turbiville for Claude Mounce.

27:39.498 --> 27:41.800
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:42.883 --> 27:48.985
[Silence.]

27:49.000 --> 27:59.000
[Music.]

27:59.000 --> 28:08.000
