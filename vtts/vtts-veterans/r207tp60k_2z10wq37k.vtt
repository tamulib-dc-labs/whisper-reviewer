00:18.644 --> 00:38.780
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.842
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.565 --> 00:51.082
When you go to the website for the Department of Veterans Affairs, you will find a list of some 368 frequently asked questions just concerning veterans' benefits.

00:51.102 --> 00:54.368
And that doesn't include the questions that are not frequently asked.

00:54.388 --> 01:00.818
One question some local veterans might have is, where can I go to find out about benefits or just to get primary health care?

01:00.798 --> 01:09.052
Well, that's simple, and College Station on Rock Prairie Road, right across the street from the College Station Medical Center, is a community-based outpatient clinic.

01:09.533 --> 01:20.432
Rene Ramirez, a Marine, is a veteran counselor there, and he himself, a veteran who has served practically all over the world, including Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan.

01:20.933 --> 01:24.780
But today, his passion is to help other veterans find out answers.

01:25.081 --> 01:29.409
about the benefits that they're entitled to but may not know that they are.

01:29.429 --> 01:32.696
So please welcome Rene Ramirez to Veterans of the Valley.

01:33.177 --> 01:38.006
First off, I want to make it clear, you don't work for the Veterans Administration, you work for the Texas Veterans Commission.

01:38.266 --> 01:38.447
Yes, sir.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.170
That's right.

01:40.150 --> 01:42.453
Talk a little bit first off about your own service.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.474
We touched on that.

01:43.754 --> 01:49.140
I certainly don't want to let the show go by without you talking about your 26 years in the Marine Corps.

01:49.741 --> 01:58.831
And you just started listing places that you'd been from the East Coast, Norway, Africa, Israel, Greece, Italy, Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Japanese islands.

01:59.352 --> 02:02.976
And then as we mentioned, Somalia and Bosnia and Iraq and Afghanistan.

02:03.036 --> 02:05.719
Talk a little bit about what your service is and what you did.

02:06.357 --> 02:11.882
Well, I started off after high school, because I didn't know what I really wanted to do.

02:12.663 --> 02:15.646
And being a Marine sounded like a good deal.

02:15.786 --> 02:19.770
So I did that, and it kind of flourished from there.

02:19.870 --> 02:25.395
My first overseas tour was in Norway, where I got to live in an igloo, which was great.

02:27.076 --> 02:28.678
I learned what a kosher really was then.

02:28.978 --> 02:30.480
It was great for a while, I bet.

02:33.442 --> 02:35.284
I was a radio operator.

02:35.787 --> 02:38.150
you know, worked on communications equipment at the time.

02:38.190 --> 02:45.861
I was with a tank or AAV battalion where we worked on Amtraks on the different communications assets inside of it.

02:45.881 --> 02:47.303
Right.

02:47.424 --> 02:49.046
Like I said, I joined out of high school in 1982.

02:49.086 --> 02:53.072
I went into the reserves because I wasn't quite sure, you know, Marines, you know.

02:53.813 --> 02:58.720
So after about a year and a half of that, I decided, wow, this is pretty good.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.462
There's got to be, you know, there's got to be

03:01.235 --> 03:01.876
more out there.

03:01.936 --> 03:02.677
And that's what I did.

03:02.697 --> 03:03.479
I went active duty.

03:04.620 --> 03:10.710
Did like, you know, packed up my family and took off and went and wanted to go to the station at Camp Lejeune.

03:10.730 --> 03:10.890
Right.

03:11.191 --> 03:16.399
Where I spent, well, I say I spent 10 years there, but it was actually my family spent 10 years there.

03:16.439 --> 03:18.923
As you noted, I got to travel around a little bit.

03:19.223 --> 03:19.824
Exactly.

03:19.844 --> 03:20.504
A whole lot.

03:20.524 --> 03:21.245
See the world.

03:21.265 --> 03:23.307
But it was exciting.

03:23.347 --> 03:25.249
It was a great 26 years.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.432
But you can't stay there forever.

03:27.852 --> 03:28.072
No.

03:28.613 --> 03:31.216
Communications, though, was what you did.

03:31.496 --> 03:34.859
Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.924
I think you told me in Afghanistan it involved air defense.

03:38.944 --> 03:40.906
And so just talk a little bit about that.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.487
You were in communications.

03:42.868 --> 03:43.088
Yes.

03:43.439 --> 03:47.647
For Somalia and Bosnia, I was on the USS Guam.

03:48.308 --> 03:53.257
I was in charge of the watches of the Landing Force Operations Center.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.180
It was exciting.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.007
We got to hear what's going on everywhere at all times.

03:59.027 --> 04:00.790
The only thing that wasn't too fun was

04:01.158 --> 04:07.414
When troops landed, I had to stay on the ship and see everybody else or hear everybody go ashore.

04:07.895 --> 04:10.742
So that was interesting.

04:10.762 --> 04:13.369
But that's basically what I did for Bosnia and Somalia.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.133
For...

04:15.248 --> 04:25.365
Afghanistan, like you mentioned, my unit provided the network pipeline for the air defense systems.

04:26.486 --> 04:28.229
We made sure that they stayed up.

04:28.249 --> 04:32.937
We also provided the emails and internet access and all that.

04:32.917 --> 04:41.788
and nice little stuff there and also control the firewalls and make sure we stayed within standards so we couldn't be hacked and stuff like that.

04:42.569 --> 04:42.829
Right.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.331
Well, thank you for your service.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.995
You came to College Station in June of 2007.

04:47.115 --> 04:54.604
Let's talk about why you're here today and to talk about the outpatient clinic in College Station, which is on Rock Prairie Road.

04:54.584 --> 05:01.274
Not only for the people who don't know that it's there, but the people who know that it's there, but doesn't know exactly the services that it provides.

05:01.294 --> 05:11.891
We'll get specific in a minute, but just generally talk about the outpatient clinic and the general services that it provides, that you provide, that it provides as a primary health facility.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.453
Sort of talk about the clinic.

05:13.433 --> 05:17.343
As you mentioned, it is a primary health care clinic.

05:18.506 --> 05:27.408
Veterans come there to be seen for any normal routine clinical or medical issues that they may have.

05:27.488 --> 05:29.653
And if any kind of specialty care is needed,

05:29.633 --> 05:38.123
The primary caregiver that they are assigned there will give them a consult to go see the doctor in like Temple and stuff like that.

05:38.483 --> 05:43.589
They also provide the flu shot annually for flu season.

05:46.453 --> 05:54.662
That's where veterans can go to get their H1N1 also as well as the regular flu season stuff.

05:54.642 --> 05:57.407
So simple health care is what we're talking about.

05:57.427 --> 06:01.273
They'll draw blood there for tests and things like that.

06:01.313 --> 06:03.477
Simple health care.

06:03.497 --> 06:09.327
If it's determined that they need to see a specialist that may be in Temple, that's when they're referred to Temple.

06:09.374 --> 06:09.975
Yes, sir.

06:09.995 --> 06:26.615
If they're in the Temple regional area, we do have people that, because Brazos Valley or Brazos County is the borderline between the Houston and Temple area, if they're, say, for instance, in Navasota, they will be referred to Houston to go and get their care there.

06:26.675 --> 06:26.856
Right.

06:26.876 --> 06:29.739
That's the Michael DeBakey VA Medical Center there in Houston.

06:29.999 --> 06:36.968
Matter of fact, there are, for people who don't know, five VA medical centers in Texas in Bonham, Houston, Kerrville, Temple,

06:37.268 --> 06:37.950
and in Waco.

06:38.471 --> 06:42.120
And so those are the five there.

06:42.140 --> 06:45.447
From your desk specifically, you're a counselor.

06:45.508 --> 06:50.299
People come in and they say, I'm a veteran, I served, here's my papers,

06:50.701 --> 06:52.343
what benefits do I have?

06:52.823 --> 06:56.908
Especially in this day and age when the economy is much tighter on people.

06:56.948 --> 07:03.555
People are losing jobs, people are needing the money that they're entitled to, but there's an awful lot of people out there that don't know what they're entitled to, right?

07:03.836 --> 07:04.596
That's where you come in.

07:04.737 --> 07:05.718
Yes, sir.

07:06.459 --> 07:15.869
I thought it was quite surprising that there are a lot of veterans that go back as far as World War II that didn't know that they rate certain benefit.

07:16.730 --> 07:19.493
What I do mainly is compensation and pension.

07:20.198 --> 07:25.889
Compensation is for injuries or illnesses incurred while in service.

07:25.909 --> 07:35.288
A pension is for low-income wartime veterans or age 65, because the VA considers a veteran who is 65 or older

07:35.690 --> 07:40.657
basically 100% disabled, therefore they provide a pension for them.

07:41.077 --> 07:44.522
And again, the pension portion is based on income.

07:44.542 --> 07:53.434
So if a veteran banks above what the Congress has set as an income, then of course that pension can't be given to them.

07:53.494 --> 07:55.757
Whereas a compensation

07:55.973 --> 07:59.458
It doesn't matter what your income is, you will get that.

08:00.119 --> 08:03.143
And it's not only about money when it comes to compensation.

08:03.664 --> 08:14.939
Compensation is the key to getting into the VA system and getting the care that you deserve as a veteran because of the injuries incurred while in service.

08:15.741 --> 08:17.543
For instance, if a veteran

08:17.523 --> 08:23.729
was injured, broke a leg or something like that while in service, and now it's starting to bother him.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.794
If he's service-connected for it, he can come right to the clinic and get treated for it.

08:28.394 --> 08:39.766
If a new surgery is required, he can get the surgery right, well, not right there at College Station, but he can be referred over to Temple or Houston to get the care he needs, or her needs.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.868
Exactly, exactly.

08:43.150 --> 08:46.213
And we talked about the primary care, and

08:46.801 --> 08:50.087
They'll make the evaluation to see if a specialty care is needed.

08:50.107 --> 08:52.852
And that's when they would go to one of the VA hospitals.

08:53.953 --> 09:04.912
One thing that you wanted to make sure that people realize is they do not necessarily have needed to serve in a combat zone, in combat, to benefit this.

09:04.932 --> 09:11.003
You talked about one veteran that came that actually, during the Vietnam War, did his service in El Paso.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.023
Right, right.

09:12.043 --> 09:13.784
And he had injuries from playing football.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.085
Yes.

09:14.645 --> 09:21.672
I don't remember if it was actually football or baseball, but I thought it was football, but I think it was more like baseball.

09:21.692 --> 09:22.653
But either way, it doesn't matter.

09:22.673 --> 09:23.914
It was a sport that he played.

09:24.455 --> 09:31.361
He played for the Air Force and he traveled around and he played the sport and he had several injuries.

09:31.381 --> 09:37.767
And he was told that because he did not go overseas, that he did not rate benefits, which is not true.

09:38.268 --> 09:38.408
Mm hmm.

09:38.590 --> 09:50.659
He did not rate any combat type benefits, but he did rate the fact that he was in during wartime because everybody does their part, whether you're serving in the rear in the States

09:50.740 --> 09:54.704
or serving overseas, somebody has to be where you're at.

09:54.724 --> 09:58.407
Even if you didn't serve in the actual combat zone, somebody has to be there.

09:59.088 --> 10:06.615
So you rate almost everything they do, except for actual combat type awards and stuff like that.

10:06.995 --> 10:12.800
And they can also be provided with the benefits that are needed.

10:12.820 --> 10:20.207
In his case, he had a bunch of injuries that now because he's in his 60s, he had difficulty walking.

10:20.187 --> 10:26.475
because the injuries that he sustained while playing the sports and stuff like that.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.197
And I told him that, yes, you do rate it.

10:28.717 --> 10:34.725
The first thing we had to do is get him into the clinic where they have the 1010EZ form.

10:35.245 --> 10:39.491
I had to get him in to get a primary caregiver.

10:39.931 --> 10:43.235
But I submitted the paperwork.

10:43.275 --> 10:49.603
We worked and got the times and dates that he was seeing because if an injury happened in a federal installation,

10:50.073 --> 10:55.303
or near a federal installation and they were seen at a federal installation, then the VA can easily go there and pull the record.

10:55.323 --> 10:58.770
So it's real easy to just get the information for that.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.154
And we put in a claim for them for all that stuff.

11:01.395 --> 11:01.896
Right.

11:01.916 --> 11:13.077
And I think it's important that people realize we're talking about, let's say, people my age who serve, who I did not serve in Vietnam, but people my age who did serve in Vietnam.

11:13.462 --> 11:17.328
You know, they're getting into their 60s, into their early 70s now.

11:17.348 --> 11:19.031
And they did serve during that time.

11:19.051 --> 11:23.358
They're getting the normal aches and pains of any 60 and 70-year-old person they're going to get.

11:23.438 --> 11:25.101
Yes, they are.

11:25.321 --> 11:32.012
Whether these aches and pains are a result of either their combat in Vietnam, that really doesn't matter.

11:32.052 --> 11:35.858
They can come to the VA clinic and get treated like that.

11:36.344 --> 11:45.962
And not only that, but a very important thing to talk about is about medications, because they're getting more and more expensive, and the copay is a lot less expensive, right, if they're insured.

11:46.002 --> 11:48.427
The copay for the VA is less expensive.

11:48.747 --> 11:55.219
They give you 30 days of prescriptions, and I can't quote exactly the price.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.103
I know I used to be like...

11:57.083 --> 12:03.574
$8, but it may have gone up a little bit, but still a lot of it is cheaper than it is out in town.

12:03.794 --> 12:14.873
Oh yeah, because normally you're talking about insurance policies now where they're anywhere from $25, $35, $45 if they're named drugs and things like that, if they're not generic drugs.

12:14.853 --> 12:34.633
right the the i guess the key the key thing to uh to remember about the va is that the va is not a a health insurance company it is a health care provider right so uh if if uh to to qualify uh for for anything other than combat related uh uh

12:34.613 --> 12:50.040
care it all is based on your income they have eight different levels of qualifications to come to the VA clinic of course it's it's for veterans who haven't who have

12:50.020 --> 12:57.550
income where they just, you know, live off of Social Security or and in their Social Security isn't enough, then they'll qualify for possibly full care.

12:57.911 --> 12:58.592
Right.

12:58.612 --> 13:04.600
And then another another caveat to the to the service connected.

13:05.281 --> 13:11.890
If a veteran is 50% or greater on his service connected disabilities, he's got free health care from from now on.

13:11.910 --> 13:12.211
I see.

13:12.251 --> 13:18.199
Because, I mean, if he's 50% disabled, then he the VA is going to take care of him.

13:18.219 --> 13:18.500
Right.

13:18.860 --> 13:19.521
For everything.

13:20.682 --> 13:22.327
Renee, you touched on this a moment ago.

13:22.567 --> 13:25.575
You said you were talking about the monetary side and the care side.

13:25.596 --> 13:25.856
Right.

13:25.876 --> 13:34.219
There might be some veterans that come to you that after they got out of the service, they went on and made themselves a nice living and got themselves a nest egg.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.345
And they might come to you and say, hey, I don't need the money.

13:36.578 --> 13:37.940
But that's not really the point.

13:37.980 --> 13:42.445
The point is that they need to come see you to get the paperwork to get the health care.

13:42.605 --> 13:43.486
Right, for the health care.

13:44.007 --> 13:50.415
And being a veteran myself of Iraq and Afghanistan, I kind of felt this when I first got out.

13:50.435 --> 13:52.497
I didn't need the VA.

13:52.618 --> 13:53.058
I'm fine.

13:53.759 --> 13:57.303
Of course, once I did the physical, they found out I wasn't as fine as I thought I was.

13:58.144 --> 14:05.353
But anyway, I have veterans who were in combat areas that feel that they don't need it.

14:05.722 --> 14:09.269
that it's for people who are seriously hurt, and that's not the case.

14:09.890 --> 14:20.710
It is good to go ahead and get into the VA system, because I do have veterans who, like you mentioned, they made a great living,

14:21.584 --> 14:36.383
and they were mainly, well, I don't wanna put down any particular industry, but they were doing very well, and then something as little as a stroke comes along, and they can no longer do that job anymore.

14:36.643 --> 14:43.272
If they were in the VA system and were taken to a hospital,

14:43.741 --> 14:53.544
and mentioned, anyone mentioned that they were a veteran, then chances are the VA will pick up the tab depending on whether or not that veteran can afford to pay for it or not.

14:53.604 --> 14:54.747
And if a veteran

14:54.828 --> 14:58.973
is making good money and lives great, and then all of a sudden he's not making anything.

14:59.494 --> 15:06.103
The VA is there, I guess, kind of like to catch veterans and help them out when they really, really need it.

15:06.243 --> 15:08.686
Now, the important word is there when they really, really need it.

15:08.986 --> 15:09.988
Right, right.

15:10.468 --> 15:20.481
You and I were talking earlier about a situation that was close to me that we'll just use as an example, say, a veteran, a World War II veteran who now finds himself, say, in assisted living or in a nursing home.

15:20.967 --> 15:27.552
not at a VA hospital, but in a private nursing home of some sort.

15:27.920 --> 15:38.312
As long as if they served in wartime and can produce their honorable discharge and all the proper paperwork and all of that, they have benefits coming according to their income.

15:38.332 --> 15:44.299
And a lot of time their income might only be Social Security, maybe a few little investments on the side or something like that.

15:45.140 --> 15:51.206
But according to their income, they have benefits coming that they might not even know about that they just need to apply for.

15:51.226 --> 15:51.767
Yes, they do.

15:52.118 --> 15:58.331
They have a regular pension I mentioned, but then the pension also, there's a special monthly pension.

15:59.213 --> 16:03.662
Special monthly, yeah, pension, that's what it's called, I'm sorry.

16:03.682 --> 16:12.861
And it's for situations such as that, where a veteran finds themselves where they were living at home, they were fine and everything like that, and they were living great, and now they find themselves

16:12.942 --> 16:27.849
needing to go into a nursing home or assisted living, then they can apply for a special monthly pension, which will help pay for that aid and attendance, which aid and attendance doesn't necessarily mean that you have to go to an assisted living.

16:28.290 --> 16:34.461
For instance, if you have a parent coming to live with you and that parent

16:34.947 --> 16:38.752
well, a parent of a spouse of a veteran, let's put it that way.

16:38.953 --> 16:39.854
It's got to be delivered with you.

16:40.835 --> 16:52.311
And the veteran or the spouse requires some kind of extra care that they can't really take care of themselves fully.

16:52.331 --> 16:57.158
Then they can put in for aid and attendance to where they'll get an extra

16:57.138 --> 17:13.935
a little extra money in their pension to alleviate or to either hire somebody to come in and assist them or to give a veteran's family members a little extra money for the assistance.

17:14.015 --> 17:16.217
Basically because somebody's caring for that individual.

17:16.277 --> 17:16.597
Right.

17:16.677 --> 17:17.398
What it comes down to.

17:18.019 --> 17:26.487
And if that veteran, in the case that we were talking about with a personal situation with

17:26.990 --> 17:32.326
relative of mine if that veteran passes away and they have a surviving spouse.

17:32.386 --> 17:35.937
In this case, we were talking about a surviving widow.

17:36.085 --> 17:40.172
It's just another case of filing other paperwork for that widow to get benefits.

17:40.252 --> 17:40.873
Right, right.

17:41.153 --> 17:45.240
There's a different, there's a form 534.

17:45.681 --> 17:46.562
It's a widow's pension.

17:47.023 --> 17:55.177
Also, one of the things that we need to, that's important for veterans to do, and veterans need to do this because they need to do it for their families.

17:55.737 --> 17:58.482
And that is, if they're,

17:58.462 --> 18:05.149
Because there's what they call presumptive disabilities that you can get for being in certain areas of combat.

18:05.189 --> 18:06.514
For instance,

18:07.017 --> 18:09.080
There's Vietnam, the Agent Orange issue.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.502
Everybody's heard about that.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.686
They just added three more disabilities to that, if you keep track of that.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.568
One of those is diabetes, I know, right?

18:15.588 --> 18:19.514
Well, diabetes has been on there since, I believe, like 1995 or something like that.

18:19.614 --> 18:20.795
Exactly.

18:21.657 --> 18:30.929
One of them is, oh, I can't remember exactly the name of it, but it has to do with something with the heart condition and also, well, anyway, it's other disabilities.

18:31.049 --> 18:33.132
They can actually go to VA.gov and see what they are.

18:33.412 --> 18:33.693
Right.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.957
And if they are covered...

18:38.000 --> 18:53.376
or they have these disabilities and they have them recorded, they're service-connected for it, and they happen to, like you mentioned, pass, then the spouse is actually covered because then she'll get, because there's, for spouses, there's DIC,

18:53.744 --> 18:56.730
And then there's also a widow's pension.

18:57.291 --> 19:09.334
A widow's pension, just like compensation pension for a veteran, a widow's pension is based on the income, whereas a DIC is based on the veteran dying from something that was service-connected.

19:09.374 --> 19:11.939
For instance, like I mentioned earlier, Agent Orange.

19:12.019 --> 19:13.502
Agent Orange causes diabetes.

19:13.582 --> 19:14.925
They have diabetes causes diabetes.

19:15.580 --> 19:28.240
heart conditions, a veteran dies of a heart attack because of, and it states that the doctor feels that the reason why he died from this heart attack was because of the diabetes, made it worse.

19:28.490 --> 19:36.919
then that spouse is covered with DIC and gets a lot more benefits than if she were just receiving a widow's pension.

19:36.939 --> 19:45.588
Because as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, if you had boots on the ground in Vietnam, you are considered to have been affected by Agent Arch.

19:45.728 --> 19:46.468
One day, it doesn't matter.

19:47.089 --> 19:55.678
I have a veteran that flew in for one day and they said, you don't have enough time in service to stay here, you gotta go home.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.720
So he had to turn around and leave.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.423
He was there for one day because he left the next morning.

20:00.443 --> 20:03.406
He was there for one day and he left, so therefore he qualifies.

20:04.067 --> 20:09.053
Now that also, they have what they call blue and brown water navy.

20:09.253 --> 20:12.917
Brown water navy is like John Kerry.

20:12.937 --> 20:19.825
He drove his gunboat in and out of the waterways there, so he is considered in the brown water navy.

20:20.846 --> 20:26.172
If a small craft from a larger ship came over

20:26.472 --> 20:33.041
dropped this gate and people got out and let's say, you know, went and bought a Mai Tai or something and got back on the ship.

20:33.061 --> 20:39.370
Well, then they're considered being there also, even though they spent 99% of their time on the ship itself.

20:39.491 --> 20:44.077
If they docked and went a chore, then they qualify for it also.

20:44.317 --> 20:45.159
Right.

20:45.179 --> 20:49.645
Folks, this is a taxpayer money that we're talking about.

20:50.435 --> 20:54.399
you know, I don't want to get political here, but it doesn't need to stay in the government coffers.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.961
It needs to go to the people who deserve it.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.885
And those are the veterans who have defended our country.

20:58.905 --> 21:02.769
I want to touch on, we've got about six or seven minutes left.

21:02.789 --> 21:04.791
And we talked about this the other day when we were visiting.

21:05.332 --> 21:15.143
PTSD is certainly an issue, post-traumatic stress disorder that has come out of, I guess, every war, Vietnam, and certainly Iraq, Afghanistan,

21:15.123 --> 21:22.537
And it's a situation that a lot of veterans don't like to talk about because there's an implication there that there's a weakness there.

21:23.078 --> 21:27.486
I had a veteran on just a few weeks ago who had been diagnosed with PTSD.

21:27.947 --> 21:37.384
And his message to our viewers was, don't be a hero if you think you're suffering from it.

21:38.056 --> 21:38.818
go get help.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.603
And you want to say the same thing.

21:40.683 --> 21:41.726
They're already heroes.

21:41.746 --> 21:44.774
They don't have to be a hero because they're already heroes.

21:44.794 --> 21:50.149
They've done something that very few people want to do.

21:50.971 --> 21:51.392
They did it.

21:51.472 --> 21:53.297
They volunteered.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.651
for the new service now.

21:55.671 --> 21:56.734
They volunteered to go in there.

21:56.754 --> 21:59.821
For those people who were drafted, well then of course, I didn't want to be here.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.407
It gets pretty rough that way too.

22:02.487 --> 22:11.488
But if you feel, if a veteran feels that they're suffering from PTSD, and they can go to va.gov and see what the difference

22:11.941 --> 22:12.842
symptoms are.

22:14.023 --> 22:20.991
They can go to the VA clinic and request to see a social worker.

22:21.412 --> 22:24.355
And a social worker, you just go in there, and her name is Teresa Cannon.

22:24.395 --> 22:26.758
She works over there at the clinic.

22:27.459 --> 22:33.085
Me and her kind of work close together because if she finds that maybe this person needs to put in for it, she'll send them over to me.

22:33.105 --> 22:34.607
And if I get a veteran in there who

22:35.971 --> 22:42.564
And I have gotten them in there that don't realize they have it and I see it and I tell them if they wish to go over there, they can.

22:42.585 --> 22:45.490
If not, because you can't force somebody to do that.

22:45.651 --> 22:51.162
They can go over there and they can discuss it with her and then see and get them started getting treatment for that.

22:51.142 --> 23:01.897
But anyway, they can go over to the VA clinic and request to see the social worker or request to see a psychologist, which if they ask for that, they'll wind up seeing Teresa either way.

23:03.019 --> 23:07.826
And let's say, for instance, they're already in the VA system and they add an appointment.

23:07.846 --> 23:14.835
They can actually let their primary caregiver there know that, you know, I feel, you know, whatever.

23:15.336 --> 23:20.203
And then they will recommend they see a psychologist, psychiatrist either also.

23:20.504 --> 23:33.091
And one reason this is important, and I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, I want you to go on with that thought, is that PTSD, while it's a psychological disorder, it can also lead to physical disabilities, many physical disabilities, and indeed it does.

23:33.652 --> 23:33.993
It could.

23:34.033 --> 23:38.462
It could lead to, well, in some cases,

23:39.505 --> 23:44.493
Any kind of real stress on your body can lead to physical manifestation.

23:44.993 --> 23:48.699
I'm not a doctor, so I can't really diagnose or say exactly what it would cause.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.844
Well, I don't think there's a doctor anywhere that would deny that.

23:52.165 --> 23:59.556
It causes some, like one of the things that I've seen was that it's been put in there, that hypertension.

23:59.536 --> 23:59.897
Right.

24:00.257 --> 24:03.264
But it's not guaranteed that that's the cause of it.

24:03.284 --> 24:07.993
What I wanted to say about PTSD is that there is more than one way to suffer from PTSD.

24:08.053 --> 24:10.499
It is not necessarily a combat related issue.

24:11.601 --> 24:12.643
There's there.

24:13.505 --> 24:16.110
If you were in service and the

24:17.727 --> 24:39.871
saw an accident while you were in service, a jeep, well they don't have jeeps no more, Humvee flips over and something happens or a mechanized vehicle falls off a cliff which is an exact, I do have a claim like that and it's not really something I want to describe but this guy saw that, went down to assist and he suffers from PTSD because of that night.

24:40.491 --> 24:45.777
So it's not, and then there's also other traumas such as

24:46.145 --> 24:47.867
Sexual trauma.

24:48.067 --> 24:57.339
If something happened to somebody while they were in the service, then they can actually bring that up as part of PTSD also.

24:57.479 --> 24:59.762
Right, so there's a wide range there of that.

25:00.563 --> 25:06.010
You talked about one individual that came to you and said that they believed that they would not be

25:06.361 --> 25:12.709
alive, had it not been for a group session that's offered by your local, Teresa offers with a local clinic.

25:12.749 --> 25:13.590
Teresa Cannon, yes.

25:13.951 --> 25:20.539
This is a Vietnam veteran, and an incident happened that caused him to suffer.

25:21.420 --> 25:31.553
And there was, he feels that his actions or reactions weren't good enough, and he suffers from PTSD as well as depression.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.877
He told me, Sarge, if it wasn't for that group, I wouldn't be here right now.

25:34.897 --> 25:35.138
Right.

25:35.198 --> 25:36.199
Because those guys...

25:37.040 --> 25:42.128
know where I'm coming from, and they've been there too, and I can relate with those.

25:43.350 --> 25:51.463
And I can honestly say that's probably one of the reasons why I have this job is because I can talk to people who I can relate with.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.384
Right.

25:52.404 --> 26:04.363
So it certainly is something that people don't need to ignore and people need to understand, and the Texas Veterans Commission and the clinic right here on Rock Prairie Road is available to help.

26:04.782 --> 26:07.425
I was looking at some numbers that were really incredible.

26:09.427 --> 26:11.969
This is from the Veterans Administration website.

26:11.989 --> 26:16.714
There are some 25 million veterans living in the US today.

26:16.734 --> 26:27.264
But that number pales in comparison to the some 70 million that are potentially eligible for VA benefits when you include veterans, family members, and survivors.

26:27.945 --> 26:32.950
And an awful lot of those don't know about what they're entitled to.

26:33.402 --> 26:35.885
I did want to mention that we do have one more counselor.

26:36.446 --> 26:38.488
He works for the county, the Brazos County.

26:38.929 --> 26:40.691
Each county has a veteran service officer.

26:40.751 --> 26:45.977
We do have a counselor there in downtown by the name of Johnny Yepes.

26:46.478 --> 26:54.768
He's there only three days a week, Vietnam veteran, and he's there to serve too if they can't make it up to Rock Prairie.

26:54.788 --> 26:59.494
At least they can go down to the county office there and request to see a

26:59.474 --> 27:28.873
veteran service officer there right right before we leave we got a couple of minutes left I want to make sure that people know the the address and the telephone number I don't know whether we can put it up on the screen or not but again it's a 1651 Rock Prairie and it's right across the street from the College Station Medical Center right there on the first floor suite 100 right across the street from the Medical Center and the phone number it's in the book 680-0361 and

27:29.512 --> 27:34.297
There's so much more that we could talk about about the service that it provides.

27:34.377 --> 27:40.223
But I think that we've told people who don't know that it exists that it does.

27:40.243 --> 27:43.406
People who do know that it exists a little bit about what you do.

27:43.807 --> 27:52.936
And I want to thank you for what you do because you provide a service just as important now as you did when your boots were on the ground when you were serving as a United States Marine.

27:53.496 --> 27:53.797
Thank you.

27:54.417 --> 27:54.918
Indeed.

27:54.938 --> 27:55.498
Indeed.

27:55.519 --> 27:56.099
Thank you, Rene.

27:56.159 --> 27:58.241
Thank you for your service and thank you for being with us.

27:58.261 --> 27:58.562
Yes, sir.

27:58.622 --> 27:58.962
Thank you.

27:59.498 --> 28:04.285
So there you have an overview of what is available to veterans right here in the Brazos Valley.

28:04.626 --> 28:15.562
Many veterans are taking advantage of the benefits that they have rightly earned, but there are certainly many others out there who have learned something today that they did not know before.

28:15.582 --> 28:25.337
We thank Rene Ramirez, not only for his service to his country, but to his daily service to fellow veterans at the local VA clinic on Rock Prairie Road in College Station.

28:25.790 --> 28:26.697
Join us next week.

28:27.101 --> 28:28.492
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:28.512 --> 28:29.843
This is Veterans of the Valley.
