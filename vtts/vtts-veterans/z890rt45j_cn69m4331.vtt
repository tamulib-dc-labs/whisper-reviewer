00:08.485 --> 00:31.251
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.271 --> 00:32.232
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:33.190 --> 00:51.857
Walter Cronin was 16 years old when he graduated from high school, but as you will find out, Colonel Cronin was on the fast track just about all his life, certainly during a distinguished military career that spanned 27 years, a career that sent him to service not only in the United States, but to Japan, Korea, Paris, London, and Vietnam.

00:52.529 --> 00:56.775
He kept up with World War II as a schoolboy, joined the Merchant Marines, and then the Army in 1946.

00:57.717 --> 01:04.487
He was coming into military service just as the fighting was wrapping up in the Pacific, but it's an intriguing story of service.

01:04.507 --> 01:07.010
And we're proud to have Colonel Walter J. Cronin, Jr.

01:07.030 --> 01:08.913
as our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:08.933 --> 01:11.517
Walter, it is indeed a pleasure to have you.

01:11.497 --> 01:37.285
you really did take the fast track 16 years old you graduated from high school by the time you were 17 years old you were already a buck sergeant in the army and you just got promoted from there so at that time with world war ii ending going into the korean conflict a lot of people were getting out of service so they needed young men and they advanced them fast and you were kind of part of that weren't you absolutely right there johnny on the spot indeed talk about sort of what

01:37.265 --> 01:44.192
First, your service in the merchant marines and then into the active army and then the army reserves and then how it moved on from there.

01:45.093 --> 01:51.660
Well, my service in the merchant marine was very short because I couldn't join the army until I was 17.

01:52.521 --> 02:04.133
So at 16, I went to the maritime service actually and went through the training facility at Sheepshead Bay, New York, where they trained merchant seamen to man the merchant fleet.

02:04.366 --> 02:08.009
And of course, the merchant fleet was still quite large at the end of the war.

02:08.650 --> 02:11.472
They started decommissioning the ships.

02:11.492 --> 02:13.814
And I was on a training ship.

02:14.074 --> 02:19.839
When I graduated, they offered me a job on the training ship as an instructor at 16 years old.

02:19.859 --> 02:24.523
And we had men 16 to 60, so it was an interesting experience, to say the least.

02:24.683 --> 02:30.068
You were a young guy, and I guess some of the older people, did they resent this young guy coming in and moving up so fast?

02:30.088 --> 02:31.469
They weren't too happy about it.

02:32.089 --> 02:33.951
But nonetheless...

02:35.416 --> 03:00.951
they uh when i got out of the merchant marine i left the merchant marine window because they decommissioned the ship i was on right and i went back to washington which was close to my home yeah and saw a billboard said join the army so i went down and joined the army at 17. by that time i had turned 17. right and so i went off to basic training and it just

03:01.184 --> 03:09.473
kept on going, but I went in through basic training at Fort Knox, Kentucky in September of 46.

03:09.908 --> 03:21.026
And because all the troops were coming home from overseas, the Army was in dire need of troops to fill the vacancies of those that were coming home from overseas.

03:21.046 --> 03:29.659
And so they reduced the provisions for enlistment in the Army from like the three or four year term normal down to 18 months.

03:29.699 --> 03:37.772
So they got quite an influx of young men who were caught between ages like myself

03:37.938 --> 04:05.481
where you couldn't go to college because i couldn't no no university would accept you because you have to be a veteran well the only way you get to be a veteran was to go and get and be one so i opted to go into the army and almost immediately they curtailed the basic training and shipped us to japan in december of 1946 right i arrived in japan right this is actually before the surrender had actually been signed so you were

04:05.697 --> 04:08.780
In Japan, fighting had stopped, but the surrender hadn't happened right.

04:09.121 --> 04:12.584
The full peace treaty had not been signed at all.

04:14.746 --> 04:20.753
Surrender had already taken place, fighting the formal aspects of that had stopped, but the war was still technically on.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.194
Exactly.

04:22.534 --> 04:25.297
Your 20th birthday, you were actually promoted to Master Sergeant.

04:25.317 --> 04:26.759
You were in, I believe, Washington, D.C.

04:26.779 --> 04:27.199
at the time.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.882
What was your early job there in Washington, D.C.?

04:29.842 --> 04:29.882
?

04:30.757 --> 04:33.662
Well, I had quite a few different jobs.

04:33.682 --> 04:42.997
I was moved from one to the other and got promoted very rapidly from Staff Sergeant to Master Sergeant, which at that time was as high as you could go E7.

04:44.419 --> 04:46.302
And my job at the time was

04:46.923 --> 05:04.852
I was like an administrative assistant, sort of like a sergeant major for the Washington, D.C., District of Columbia Military District, which was the office and headquarters responsible for the training, the supervision, the coordination, the input, and the National Guard and the Army Reserve.

05:05.914 --> 05:10.922
So I worked for who was the chief of that district, who was a full colonel by the name of Stuart Yell.

05:11.678 --> 05:21.739
And one day I was going through all the papers, the new regulations that the Department of the Army puts out regularly, and saw where you could become a commissioned officer if you had served.

05:22.158 --> 05:26.745
in any of the first three enlisted grades during the time of war.

05:27.045 --> 05:34.036
And technically I had, so I applied for it, went before Board of Officers at the Pentagon, and was fortunate enough to be selected.

05:34.276 --> 05:36.499
So very quickly I became a second lieutenant.

05:36.519 --> 05:37.501
And took a pay cut, right?

05:37.641 --> 05:40.405
Took a $13 a month pay cut, and that almost killed me.

05:41.827 --> 05:42.548
That was a lot of money.

05:42.748 --> 05:44.571
That was a lot of money in those days.

05:44.737 --> 05:47.701
You went on to Fort Benning and then the Korean War broke out.

05:47.741 --> 05:52.967
I think that you said that you were on the rocket launcher range when word got to you that you were headed to Korea.

05:53.368 --> 05:54.509
I bet you remember that.

05:54.529 --> 05:55.871
I remember it very vividly.

05:58.274 --> 06:04.942
I was training troops in the use of the firearms so that they would use the anti-tech weapon, the rocket launcher.

06:05.964 --> 06:13.393
When the jeep came out to tell me that I'd just been ordered to Korea, so to report back to headquarters.

06:13.745 --> 06:21.396
This was 1951 and you were in Korea 30 days and got another promotion that was kind of automatic to First Lieutenant.

06:21.416 --> 06:24.180
Let's talk about Korea, talk about your experience there.

06:24.220 --> 06:33.474
You were a ground soldier in Korea and it was during this time in Korea, this year or so in Korea that you earned the Bronze Star Medal.

06:33.494 --> 06:40.745
Talk about your time in Korea, what your job was, what you did, and the events that led up to your action that got you the Bronze Star Medal.

06:41.706 --> 06:43.549
Well, when I went to Korea,

06:43.867 --> 06:48.612
They were, all the US forces were critically short on personnel.

06:49.933 --> 06:52.356
And they had filled up the units with Koreans.

06:52.376 --> 06:53.497
They called them katusas.

06:53.577 --> 07:04.108
They were Korean army trainees that were just automatically drafted from off the street in Korea and put into the armed forces to build our force structure up to strength.

07:05.109 --> 07:07.252
And we trained them.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.193
I had an interpreter.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.814
We called all of our interpreters.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.237
We gave them all female names.

07:12.470 --> 07:16.154
all of the Korean soldiers named Rosemary.

07:16.194 --> 07:19.777
My interpreter was named Rosemary, and he didn't mind.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.620
He didn't really know, I don't think, what was going on.

07:22.640 --> 07:30.928
But anyhow, I was assigned, after I went through the Rappledapples and all, in Seoul.

07:32.069 --> 07:36.694
The fighting was just north of Seoul at that time, below the 38th parallel, right up there close to it.

07:36.754 --> 07:40.958
As a matter of fact, the 38th parallel was reasonably well established at that time.

07:41.697 --> 07:57.423
And I was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, to the 7th Infantry Regiment, to Company H. And H Company is one of the lettered companies, of course, and it's a heavy weapons company.

07:59.927 --> 08:06.979
At that time, it was structured, I don't know how they did this today, but I was in charge of the 81-millimeter mortar platoon.

08:07.752 --> 08:11.676
And at that time, we were very short on second lieutenants.

08:11.696 --> 08:18.202
So I also had the 75 millimeter recordless rifles and the heavy machine gun platoon.

08:18.903 --> 08:24.408
And we went right up on the line right away to move in to hold.

08:24.888 --> 08:36.139
There was a salient in the peace talks at the time that went up and over and up in the furthermost corner to the northeast there.

08:36.777 --> 08:37.378
Northwest.

08:39.680 --> 08:45.787
That was the high ground to control all of the valleys and one of the major approach routes to retake the city of Seoul.

08:46.989 --> 08:52.415
And the British were holding that position and they were kicked off the hill every night.

08:52.435 --> 08:55.338
The Chinese army came in and threw them off the hill.

08:55.358 --> 08:57.581
And then they had to go back and take it back every morning.

08:57.601 --> 09:02.166
But because they kept losing it, it was in dispute as to who actually owned it.

09:02.847 --> 09:04.489
And it was a dominant piece of terrain.

09:05.380 --> 09:12.389
I won't tell you how we named it or how the GIs nicknamed it, but nonetheless, it was two prominent.

09:12.429 --> 09:13.291
Old veterans will know.

09:13.311 --> 09:18.538
You just say you named it Dagmar, and old veterans will know why you named it Dagmar because of the shape of the hill.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.620
Two prominent hills together, yes.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.922
Go ahead.

09:23.504 --> 09:30.734
It was all rock up there, so when they moved us in there, we moved in in the wee hours of the morning, 2.30, 3 o'clock in the morning.

09:30.754 --> 09:31.675
We leave the British.

09:32.397 --> 09:45.181
And as the British major that had his mortar platoon in the same position where we put ours, said to me, I say, old chap, mine's now at 3 p.m.

09:45.201 --> 09:46.022
this afternoon.

09:46.683 --> 09:47.425
Beware.

09:47.465 --> 09:49.569
Well, boy, it started.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.017
And everybody was amazed at what happened because...

09:54.807 --> 10:02.294
We had no idea that the Chinese could accumulate so much artillery and fire and managed to fire it all in such a short period of time.

10:02.314 --> 10:13.625
And I've never read the official report, and I certainly didn't count the rounds, but we were started shelled at 3, 3 o'clock that afternoon, and they shelled us for 24 hours.

10:14.626 --> 10:20.692
And it was supposed to have been like 116,000 rounds that came into that sector.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.714
Well, there wasn't much left.

10:22.734 --> 10:23.835
I mean, it wasn't torn up.

10:23.855 --> 10:24.696
The trees were all

10:25.216 --> 10:27.880
totally destroyed, it was just a mess.

10:28.962 --> 10:36.373
And we were running low on ammunition, until we did run out of that usable ammunition.

10:36.733 --> 10:50.774
Because some of it, the trajectory on the mortars, they were like phosphorus rounds, were not strong enough to project that big projectile far enough out to make sure it cleared all of our own troops.

10:51.656 --> 10:53.198
So we didn't use those rounds.

10:54.123 --> 10:57.948
I couldn't raise anybody on any of the radio communications.

10:58.108 --> 11:06.680
And I made the decision to redeploy back to the ammunition dump where there was plenty of ammunition.

11:07.020 --> 11:11.967
So we could fight all day or all night for two or three days without running low even.

11:11.987 --> 11:17.354
And so I moved half of my men back there and the other half I took back later.

11:17.414 --> 11:18.316
We moved in phases.

11:18.876 --> 11:22.341
In the meantime, the people, the troops that were being kicked off the hill

11:23.114 --> 11:24.756
The Chinese attacked in force.

11:25.477 --> 11:34.427
They hit us with somewhere in the neighborhood of several divisions, which just was overwhelming because that's why the troops were low on ammunition.

11:36.670 --> 11:42.296
We were running very short because they kept coming wave after wave of soldiers.

11:42.316 --> 11:47.923
But nonetheless, I picked up those that had come off the hill because they didn't know where else to go.

11:48.325 --> 12:00.725
And I kept them and we surrounded the ambulance up, made a perimeter defense around it and kept it until we were passed through a couple of nights later to reinforce and go back and retake the hill.

12:00.745 --> 12:02.568
Then we kept it at that point after.

12:03.629 --> 12:05.372
In the citation which

12:05.740 --> 12:09.745
Colonel Cronin was awarded the bronze star medal.

12:09.845 --> 12:19.978
It said that Colonel Cronin's aggressive leadership in combat was highly instrumental in the overall success of the unit's mission during the battle for Hill 355 near Kowalsan, Korea.

12:20.339 --> 12:28.389
He assembled and reorganized all personnel in his immediate vicinity who had become separated from their respective units and led them to a point of safety.

12:28.409 --> 12:34.397
That's just part of the citation that you were awarded the bronze star medal.

12:34.782 --> 12:41.130
Indeed, it's obviously an event, especially that 24 hours, that certainly will be embedded in your memory forever.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.192
Yes, for certain.

12:42.312 --> 12:44.034
But you were a lucky soldier.

12:44.114 --> 12:48.980
You came out personally unscathed then and then later in Vietnam also.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.164
And I know that you count yourself as very blessed and very fortunate for that.

12:52.184 --> 12:53.186
Absolutely blessed.

12:53.446 --> 12:54.327
Right.

12:54.347 --> 12:57.011
You spent a little, about 12 months in Korea.

12:57.031 --> 12:58.933
And then from there, talk about...

12:59.318 --> 13:01.000
You came back home for a while.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.523
Talk about that.

13:03.823 --> 13:05.204
You thought you wanted to go to flight school.

13:05.224 --> 13:07.287
You went, but you decided that was the wrong decision, right?

13:07.647 --> 13:08.608
Absolutely wrong decision.

13:08.648 --> 13:09.950
You didn't like that at all?

13:09.970 --> 13:10.030
No.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.692
It was not my cup of tea.

13:11.712 --> 13:14.475
First place, I didn't really want to be a chauffeur.

13:15.596 --> 13:28.650
And in the Army at the time, we had more aircraft than the Air Force, but mostly they were helicopters and the small light fixed-wing observation aircraft.

13:28.883 --> 13:42.265
After I learned to fly the L-19, which I did, I decided I didn't want to pursue that as a career because you spend all your time hauling other colonels and everybody around it.

13:42.325 --> 13:45.531
I'd rather be the colonel riding around than the guy driving the plane.

13:45.831 --> 13:46.633
Right.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.155
This is a good time to pause now.

13:48.255 --> 13:52.142
Let's go to some photographs that Colonel Cronin has supplied us.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.165
These are photographs from his own collection.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.224
and pictures of him at that time.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.745
So let's go ahead and go to the first one.

13:59.166 --> 14:05.913
This is a marvelous picture that I was able to scan, and you were about what, 16 or 17 years old in that picture?

14:05.933 --> 14:06.313
I was 17.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.636
17 years old.

14:08.656 --> 14:11.819
A young, raw guy just eager to go, right?

14:11.839 --> 14:13.381
That's right, raring to go.

14:13.401 --> 14:13.941
There you are.

14:14.382 --> 14:14.842
There you are.

14:14.942 --> 14:15.763
Okay, let's move on.

14:16.444 --> 14:17.905
Here's another photograph.

14:17.945 --> 14:19.287
I guess, is this about the same time?

14:19.307 --> 14:20.608
You a little bit older there?

14:20.977 --> 14:22.640
Yes, I was 18 then.

14:22.660 --> 14:23.261
You were 18.

14:23.381 --> 14:27.267
So I had managed to obtain two stripes there and the other.

14:27.287 --> 14:27.588
Right.

14:27.608 --> 14:29.731
So you were a corporal about to be a buck sergeant, I guess.

14:29.751 --> 14:29.871
Right.

14:29.971 --> 14:30.813
Or is that buck sergeant?

14:30.953 --> 14:31.754
No, that's corporal.

14:31.794 --> 14:33.637
That's a technical corporal.

14:33.717 --> 14:34.599
A technical corporal.

14:34.619 --> 14:36.642
That's the T. Okay, let's move on from there.

14:39.847 --> 14:41.149
Where was this picture taken, you recall?

14:41.390 --> 14:47.760
That was taken in the city of Beppu in Japan, on the island of Kyushu.

14:48.331 --> 14:56.561
down at the home of the 19th Infantry Regiment in front of one of the local homes there in Beppu.

14:58.403 --> 15:01.547
That was also taken around 1946 or so.

15:01.927 --> 15:03.469
Talk about this picture.

15:03.489 --> 15:04.731
I take it that you're in this picture.

15:04.751 --> 15:06.093
What is this group?

15:06.773 --> 15:12.280
This is when I was a member of the 317th Collider Infantry Regiment, which was a reserve regiment.

15:12.580 --> 15:16.506
And it was one of the last glider infantry units in the Army.

15:16.826 --> 15:18.228
It was just before they phased them out.

15:18.268 --> 15:32.969
As you probably are aware, the glider didn't prove to be operationally such a successful weapon in the offense, the attack, because they put spikes up and destroyed most of the gliders.

15:32.989 --> 15:34.251
But this was the same unit.

15:34.291 --> 15:38.918
And it was basically a unit stationed in Washington, DC.

15:40.801 --> 15:40.861
OK.

15:40.881 --> 15:41.862
Move on to the next picture.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.298
Watch this.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.300
That's you on the left.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.985
Oh, that's my promotion to captain.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.978
I was stationed in the Minnesota military district at the time.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.005
And we're going to talk about that in a moment.

15:57.171 --> 15:57.572
Okay.

15:58.615 --> 16:02.180
And a little bit older, I guess this is closer to your retirement time, right?

16:02.200 --> 16:04.804
It's much closer to retirement time.

16:04.824 --> 16:06.947
We did age you a little bit right there, just real quickly.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.991
I was probably 43 years old then.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.294
And this is from a newsletter that you have.

16:12.334 --> 16:15.559
This was actually at the time that you retired, I think, in 1973.

16:15.839 --> 16:18.122
That's correct, the 30th of June.

16:20.586 --> 16:20.686
Okay.

16:20.706 --> 16:21.847
Now, I wanted to include this.

16:21.887 --> 16:28.116
This is the cover of the notebook where you keep a lot of your memorabilia from your service.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.380
And I was just intrigued by this cover.

16:31.421 --> 16:32.703
It's hand-painted.

16:33.644 --> 16:39.231
And talk a little bit about the cover of this notebook and who made it for you and how it came about.

16:39.251 --> 16:47.743
Well, when I was in the Beppu in the 1900 regiment, they pulled me up to the regimental headquarters to work up there.

16:48.724 --> 16:57.175
And one of my additional duties working was using the Japanese labor there to...

16:58.184 --> 17:00.407
to maintain the headquarters building.

17:00.427 --> 17:03.870
And there were six different Japanese citizens.

17:04.011 --> 17:07.835
And every night we would meet together in the conference room.

17:08.756 --> 17:12.801
And I would teach them English as they would teach me Japanese.

17:12.821 --> 17:17.526
And I'd buy them PX crackers or something and peanut butter.

17:18.547 --> 17:20.950
And we didn't have a lot to eat in those days.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.792
The PX wasn't very full of anything.

17:22.812 --> 17:26.436
So that's how they gave me that as a presento when I left.

17:26.804 --> 17:27.987
That was wonderful.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.410
That really was.

17:29.450 --> 17:32.417
We talked a little bit about after Korea.

17:32.979 --> 17:34.823
I want you to talk about your time in Minnesota.

17:34.943 --> 17:40.797
You were promoted to captain in Minnesota, the military district there, as an intelligence officer.

17:41.300 --> 17:58.629
And you told me about specifically one event during the, I guess, the McCarthy hearings where in regard to a soldier and this soldier's parents who were suspected of being communist and sort of a contentious situation you had with then Senator Hubert Humphrey.

17:59.811 --> 18:02.295
Talk about that and how that came to be and what happened there.

18:02.731 --> 18:07.035
Well, this soldier had lied and took an oath that was false.

18:08.156 --> 18:18.787
And when they discovered all of that in his personnel investigation, and he was a helicopter maintenance man, and he had lied about his parents' association with the Communist Party.

18:18.807 --> 18:28.637
His mother was the regional director of Region 5, and his father was the lead general director of Region 5 of the Communist Party.

18:29.495 --> 18:37.723
As a result of lying, they separated from the service without a discharge, without a, excuse me, determining a type of discharge.

18:38.463 --> 18:43.248
So what he came out of was with a discharge, a type to be determined.

18:43.928 --> 18:56.700
And as the intelligence officer in the command, I was given the job with my boss that was promoting me there to convene a board of officers to determine

18:57.001 --> 19:04.501
what type of discharge he should be given for his service based on the distortions of the truth and the lack of accuracy in his oath.

19:05.664 --> 19:13.204
And in the process then Senator Humphrey

19:13.403 --> 19:19.211
came to see me at the headquarters and demanded that I brief him in detail on what was going on.

19:19.231 --> 19:21.694
Well, of course, what was going on was classified.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.877
All the information involved in it was classified.

19:23.937 --> 19:28.083
So I had to respectfully remind the senator that the U.S.

19:28.504 --> 19:37.656
Army had a congressional liaison officer in Capitol Hill, and they would be happy to take and entertain any and all of his questions and do their best to answer his satisfaction.

19:37.636 --> 19:41.021
But I was not permitted to discuss it with him.

19:42.223 --> 19:50.636
And it ended up being highly publicized because it was a local boy in Minneapolis.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.138
And so there was a lot of publicity.

19:52.178 --> 19:54.902
He was standing up to the powerful senator.

19:55.063 --> 20:00.471
He was going on the television and ranting and raving that he wouldn't be told locally what was going on.

20:02.746 --> 20:04.309
So I couldn't help it.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.511
I was doing what I was told to do.

20:05.691 --> 20:06.553
Another great memory.

20:07.174 --> 20:15.449
I know that a lot of schooling, both regular schooling and Army schooling and going back and forth, but then eventually the Vietnam War broke out.

20:15.509 --> 20:20.819
I want to make sure that we get to that and what your duties were at Vietnam.

20:20.859 --> 20:21.680
You were part of the U.S.

20:21.741 --> 20:23.143
Military Assistance Command.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.868
Talk about what that was and what that involved in Vietnam.

20:26.202 --> 20:35.734
Well, that was the general headquarters for the joint staff that operated all of the armed forces that were in Vietnam.

20:35.754 --> 20:43.423
And at that time, the time that I was there, General Westmoreland was the Comus McAfee, the Commanding Officer of Military Assistance Command Vietnam.

20:44.545 --> 20:55.298
And I worked in the headquarters in the intelligence collection division so that we functioned to do all the tasking for the intelligence requirements that

20:55.818 --> 21:11.043
the Army staff or the Joint Staff needed in order to do their job to keep the commander informed every day as to all the current events that were taking place in country, where the enemy forces were, what strength and what they were about to do and so forth.

21:11.885 --> 21:16.172
And every morning we attended a general staff meeting, it was a classified meeting.

21:16.709 --> 21:28.001
And we would go over what had happened with the general staff, all the generals, the commanding general intelligence and personnel and all of it.

21:28.842 --> 21:38.553
And they'd bring up the general was small enough to date on operation, what had occurred in the last 24 hours or more frequently if he wanted a briefing more often.

21:38.573 --> 21:42.738
And we were all detailed to go because I went with my boss and sat right beside him.

21:43.278 --> 21:44.860
And if anything came our way,

21:45.717 --> 21:59.834
I would immediately go back and prepare the orders and task the forces in-country to respond in kind to collect the intelligence that was necessary in order to give him the information to make his decisions on where and when the troops were gonna do whatever they were gonna do.

22:01.416 --> 22:12.889
And also I was the assistant, I was designated as the Special Liaison Officer for all the foreign military attachés from the other countries that had,

22:13.358 --> 22:16.422
Attaché is accredited to the South Vietnamese government.

22:16.442 --> 22:20.468
I functioned as an additional duty as the Army Attaché.

22:21.289 --> 22:29.581
You had been promoted to a major in 1962 after coming back from Vietnam, promoted to lieutenant colonel and then the colonel before you retired.

22:29.601 --> 22:33.426
After Vietnam, you went to Norfolk and then back to Washington again.

22:33.727 --> 22:39.296
Finally retired from Fort Holliburton in Maryland, so that sort of goes through your military career.

22:39.536 --> 22:41.219
We've only got about three or four minutes left.

22:41.239 --> 22:44.244
I want to talk about after your military career because it's fascinating.

22:44.625 --> 22:49.232
You were on the East Coast in that area, and you became a nursery man.

22:49.252 --> 22:52.457
Talk a little bit about your career after the armed forces.

22:52.577 --> 22:57.405
Well, I spent 10 years in the nursery business with my son-in-law, and I

22:57.773 --> 22:59.415
The nursery has grown right now.

22:59.435 --> 23:01.338
It's one of the largest in the country of its kind.

23:01.959 --> 23:02.600
What's the name of it?

23:02.740 --> 23:04.282
Homestead Gardens.

23:04.763 --> 23:06.445
And it's in Davidsonville, Maryland.

23:06.525 --> 23:10.050
It's 11 miles from the Naval Academy in Annapolis.

23:11.092 --> 23:14.797
And we started out with one greenhouse.

23:15.779 --> 23:20.946
Right now, the largest greenhouse there covers one house, covers five full acres of land.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.749
all with radiant heat and everything.

23:23.809 --> 23:26.472
It's a state-of-the-art facility.

23:26.492 --> 23:40.627
It continues to grow unbelievably fast and dynamic, and we had over 200 greenhouses at one time, and I'm sure now with this big one, they don't need all that many.

23:41.348 --> 23:43.330
But it has grown and been very successful.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.871
Wow, it was a wonderful career.

23:45.452 --> 23:51.118
Your wife, Joanne, I know is in the studio with us today, and she is a proud

23:51.773 --> 23:53.375
horse person.

23:53.455 --> 23:55.076
I don't know the exact person.

23:55.096 --> 23:55.637
That's fine.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.540
She rides with the Texas ladies aside.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.902
I know an organization that I'm somewhat familiar with.

24:00.982 --> 24:09.030
I was able to come out to your home earlier this week and just some beautiful animals that you all raised there at your property near Wilburn.

24:09.050 --> 24:10.932
I know that that's a thrill for both of you.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.074
It is indeed.

24:12.774 --> 24:16.478
And Joanne is a marvelous rider and she does a great job.

24:16.898 --> 24:21.443
She just completed participating in the Houston Rodeo

24:22.064 --> 24:27.990
And her group appeared before over 500,000 people during the time of the rodeo.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.492
Yes, yeah.

24:29.512 --> 24:30.954
And you have a hobby.

24:31.254 --> 24:33.716
Go upstairs in your house and you fix clocks.

24:34.257 --> 24:37.400
You fix grandfather clocks, cuckoo clocks.

24:37.420 --> 24:40.524
You go up there and there's clock parts everywhere.

24:40.664 --> 24:42.025
That's one of your other hobbies, right?

24:42.045 --> 24:42.546
That's true.

24:42.726 --> 24:44.048
I'm going back this afternoon.

24:44.088 --> 24:46.831
I'm going back to Houston and take another course.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.936
Your service in the military, 27 years.

24:52.574 --> 24:58.182
Sort of wrap it up, when you think back to your service, what are your own personal thoughts?

24:59.304 --> 25:04.471
Well, I feel mightily blessed in many, many ways.

25:04.692 --> 25:05.914
Number one, I lived through it all.

25:06.955 --> 25:13.184
And I've lived to collect quite a fine retirement from the age of 44 now, and I'm 77.

25:14.586 --> 25:17.130
And I've been free pretty much to do

25:17.633 --> 25:19.075
as I pleased since that time.

25:19.095 --> 25:23.742
But my military service was extremely rewarding.

25:23.762 --> 25:28.268
The finest job I had in the Army actually was as a rifle company commander.

25:28.509 --> 25:29.610
Right, you told me that.

25:29.630 --> 25:34.878
And because when you're a rifle company commander, you have command of your men.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.180
You own them, literally.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.423
And you have them 24 hours a day.

25:39.404 --> 25:40.326
It was about 200.

25:41.367 --> 25:45.233
It varied with full number because we were never full strength very long.

25:46.735 --> 25:46.915
Right.

25:48.042 --> 25:59.599
You take that group of men and work with them night and day and develop them professionally to work as a competent force element to accomplish your mission.

25:59.619 --> 26:04.065
And it reflects to no small extent the men do.

26:04.546 --> 26:12.497
Your drive, your enthusiasm, your leadership is reflected in everything they do and their attitude and what they accomplish and the manner in which they do so.

26:13.017 --> 26:39.109
you like being around troops you like being around people that's why you didn't like the flying business and you like absolutely i liked it after all the all the time being with the men right it's a challenge always and always very rewarding and some of the instances are were pretty sad on many occasions but not that many mostly very pleasant memories and i had some wonderful experiences i got to go to

26:39.089 --> 26:43.655
You're a first class in the United States luxury liner as a captain.

26:44.797 --> 26:45.057
That's great.

26:45.077 --> 26:45.919
Thank you for your service.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.801
We're out of time, but I appreciate you being with us.

26:47.821 --> 26:48.382
Thank you.

26:48.402 --> 26:49.063
It's my pleasure.

26:49.083 --> 26:49.584
Thank you.

26:49.764 --> 26:50.105
Thank you.

26:50.585 --> 26:56.954
Colonel Walter Cronin can recount those years between 1946 and 1973 with amazing clarity, as you see.

26:56.974 --> 27:03.223
He is rightly proud of his military service, his civilian career as a nurseryman, and his retirement with his wife, Joanne.

27:03.203 --> 27:05.266
in rural Brazos County near Welburn.

27:05.687 --> 27:09.253
We salute and thank Colonel Walter Cronin for his service as we thank all veterans.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.197
And we thank our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:12.218 --> 27:17.486
To read more stories of local veterans, read Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:17.506 --> 27:18.407
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:18.648 --> 27:21.853
For Colonel Walter Cronin, we'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:32.785 --> 27:47.925
Amen.
