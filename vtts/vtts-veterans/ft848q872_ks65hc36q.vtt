00:06.443 --> 00:30.447
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.807 --> 00:31.928
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.701 --> 00:38.870
You're about to meet Dr. Scott Reynolds, Dr. Scotty, as he's known on his website and as the author of his recent book.

00:39.351 --> 00:44.658
It would take hours of Veterans of the Valley to tell of all of the chapters of his life so far.

00:44.678 --> 00:58.579
His service in the Navy, 14 years in the Army, his fascinating career as an Army veterinarian after graduating from A&M class of 58, service in Guam in Korea, his service as the state epidemiologist for Texas.

00:58.599 --> 01:00.261
Oh, and then two tours of Hollywood.

01:00.528 --> 01:08.577
The first when he met his wife, Lorraine, and the second when he returned to pursue acting, his 16 commercials, and the heartbreak of the cutting room floor.

01:08.998 --> 01:12.382
Let's meet the multifaceted Dr. Scott Reynolds of Bryan.

01:12.842 --> 01:15.685
Fascinating career, and we'll try to get to as much of it as we can.

01:15.745 --> 01:26.678
You grew up in Kilgore in East Texas, and after you got out finishing Kilgore, studying wasn't the thing that you wanted to do, so you went into the Navy in 1948, found yourself in Guam and eventually Korea.

01:26.718 --> 01:29.421
Let's just sort of take it from there and sort of your Navy service

01:29.401 --> 01:33.419
and how that got started and what happened in Guam and Korea?

01:33.439 --> 01:36.131
Well, of course, they trained me to work on airplanes.

01:36.272 --> 01:36.593
Yes, sir.

01:37.197 --> 01:41.503
And we knew that the Korean thing was kind of looming a little bit.

01:41.523 --> 01:45.509
And so I volunteered and was a family of Navy people.

01:46.130 --> 01:48.033
My daddy was in the Navy in the first war.

01:48.634 --> 01:55.244
And so I, right off the bat, got sent to a transport squadron out in the islands and volunteered to go to Guam.

01:55.564 --> 02:00.552
Because I wanted to see some tropical stuff and some orchids from the trees and all that kind of stuff.

02:00.592 --> 02:02.935
So I went to Guam and was having a big time.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.439
until one evening we went to the movie.

02:05.479 --> 02:08.705
In those days, we didn't have indoor theaters.

02:08.725 --> 02:15.236
We had to watch a movie on the side of a hill with a poncho and a helmet on to keep the rain off of us.

02:15.717 --> 02:19.423
We had been to the movie that evening, and I walked back on the base.

02:19.583 --> 02:25.052
I was at NES again, a naval air station again in Guam, and we had machine guns all around.

02:25.132 --> 02:27.336
I said, uh-oh, I'm into trouble.

02:28.430 --> 02:31.837
And the North Koreans had eight hours away flying time.

02:31.857 --> 02:35.425
It just invaded South Korea, so we were all put on alert.

02:36.307 --> 02:40.937
And because we were a transport squadron, we were thrown in

02:41.710 --> 02:45.378
line to do, we were hauling supplies.

02:46.159 --> 02:52.212
And the thing that really was the most important, we were hauling wounded back because anytime you have a war, you're going to get a lot of wounded.

02:52.954 --> 02:59.668
And so we were working on planes and we would fly our planes into Kempo airfield in Korea.

02:59.648 --> 03:06.159
pick up 40 or 50 wounded guys, which really was a shock to me from being from East Texas.

03:06.439 --> 03:06.820
Yes, sir.

03:07.160 --> 03:15.674
To see kids that look just like me, young kids with nine and 10 holes in them, arms missing, or we even have them in casts.

03:15.694 --> 03:17.537
And it really was a shock.

03:17.557 --> 03:22.425
And night after night, plane after plane, we would be bringing these kids back.

03:23.046 --> 03:23.166
Right.

03:23.186 --> 03:26.652
And it was quite a thing, but I was very proud of

03:27.104 --> 03:28.667
I'm not really a hero.

03:28.687 --> 03:33.055
There's a lot of guys that are much better heroes than I am, but I'm very proud that we never lost a plane.

03:33.736 --> 03:41.250
I used to worry at night that a plane would go down on the way to Honolulu with a kid on there with a cast that he would drown.

03:41.330 --> 03:45.417
So we did our thing.

03:45.734 --> 03:57.113
Things weren't going good for a while in Korea, and the Chinese came in and were pushing the Marines all the way back to the end of the peninsula.

03:57.173 --> 04:03.844
If you know anything about Korea, it's the peninsula, and they were pushing them all the way down to the end, and they had a plan

04:03.824 --> 04:22.474
Then they asked for volunteers and being some young guy from East Texas and thought I could volunteer, I volunteered to go and they were going to fly us into the end of the peninsula at a little airfield that later on I went to Korea and was stationed there called K-9 and we were going to

04:22.454 --> 04:28.606
put us in there, and we were going to work on the planes as they came in and hauled Marines back to safety.

04:29.026 --> 04:31.451
Of course, we would have been the last ones out.

04:31.711 --> 04:41.109
And I don't know what would have happened, but what saved us was MacArthur, General MacArthur, had a plan to go into Inchon, and he cut them off and saved us.

04:41.129 --> 04:45.357
So that's the closest I've been to being a hero.

04:45.758 --> 04:46.900
Fascinating career there.

04:46.920 --> 04:52.630
And then after this service in Korea, it was after that that you came back.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.234
I came to Texas A&M to be a veterinarian.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.398
I came here on the Korean GI Bill.

04:57.899 --> 05:02.687
In the meantime, I met this good-looking blue-eyed gal from Hollywood.

05:02.667 --> 05:09.398
in a church, in a church group in Hollywood Presbyterian, Hollywood Wilshire Presbyterian Church.

05:09.478 --> 05:10.820
Met Lorraine at a Halloween party.

05:10.861 --> 05:16.730
At a Halloween party and she was a student at Southern Cal University where they played pretty good football.

05:17.692 --> 05:23.241
And we had seen them play a football game that day against TCU and

05:23.221 --> 05:26.187
And so I was out rooting for TCU to get to Southern County.

05:26.207 --> 05:29.114
And that night, I said, anybody here go to Southern County?

05:29.134 --> 05:29.915
They said, she did.

05:29.935 --> 05:30.877
And that's how we met.

05:31.118 --> 05:33.583
And then she came back here with me.

05:33.683 --> 05:36.088
And we lived here and had two children.

05:37.091 --> 05:40.438
Our first freshman year in Prevent had twin daughters.

05:40.598 --> 05:41.500
Uh-huh.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.142
And I loved A&M.

05:43.322 --> 05:45.104
I guess I couldn't have made it anywhere else.

05:45.644 --> 05:49.529
You were in California, I believe, in San Diego, part of the utility squadron.

05:49.649 --> 05:50.209
That's right.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.951
I didn't tell you about my utility squadron.

05:51.991 --> 05:52.692
This was in 1951.

05:53.493 --> 05:57.497
When I came back from overseas, they put me in the utility squadron.

05:57.877 --> 06:00.460
I guess that's the only time I've ever been shot at.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.243
We were pulling a target and they would shoot at the target.

06:03.704 --> 06:06.947
So that's my war deal.

06:06.927 --> 06:09.772
So you and Lorraine came from Hollywood to College Station.

06:09.973 --> 06:10.734
That's right.

06:10.754 --> 06:15.764
And where you went to Texas A&M from 52 to 58, and you became a veterinarian.

06:15.984 --> 06:16.445
That's right.

06:16.465 --> 06:19.130
Talk about what A&M was like there in the mid-50s.

06:19.231 --> 06:20.834
Obviously, quite a bit different than it is now.

06:20.854 --> 06:21.234
Country.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.637
There was nothing here.

06:22.677 --> 06:24.160
I don't even think there was a...

06:24.140 --> 06:25.081
motel here.

06:25.101 --> 06:26.063
It may have been one.

06:26.604 --> 06:33.053
And there was one drugstore, a Black's Drugstore down here where all the vet students used to stop going out on cow calls.

06:33.074 --> 06:36.759
And we'd get a cup of coffee there, but there was nothing here.

06:36.839 --> 06:38.382
We lived in College View over there.

06:39.303 --> 06:46.654
And being a veteran, I don't know how A&M was today, but if you're a veteran, A&M welcomes here with open arms,

06:46.634 --> 06:51.023
Put me right in school, gave me a place to stay for $33 a month.

06:51.324 --> 06:51.625
Wow.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.190
Over here at College View, the old College View.

06:54.391 --> 06:54.631
Right.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.315
And I worked.

06:57.538 --> 06:59.301
I want to put a plug in for Dr. Kunkel.

06:59.341 --> 07:04.212
Dr. Kunkel knew I was instituted, and he later on became dean of that culture department.

07:04.392 --> 07:04.693
Right.

07:04.994 --> 07:11.223
And Dr. Conkle gave me a job, and I worked for him messing up his experiments.

07:11.704 --> 07:12.746
And I did about everything.

07:12.886 --> 07:14.889
I tutored for Bear Bryant.

07:15.149 --> 07:16.271
Yeah, I want to talk about that.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.153
I met the bear.

07:17.473 --> 07:21.419
I guess he was here a week, and I went there and talked to him about a football player up in my hometown.

07:21.459 --> 07:22.020
Tell us about that.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.003
You had a recruiting tip for him that he didn't think about.

07:24.023 --> 07:29.151
I had a recruiting tip for him, and there's an old boy named Bob Buston who happens to still live in Kilgore.

07:29.832 --> 07:29.972
Mm-hmm.

07:29.952 --> 07:31.874
And I said, there's a big old boy up there.

07:31.894 --> 07:33.756
You ought to recruit his name, Bob Buston.

07:33.776 --> 07:38.542
So he had his stud book there, and he was under the stadium in those days.

07:38.562 --> 07:41.345
And I think we only had 35,000 seats in that thing.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.950
And it was real raw, you know.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.872
And so I went in there, and he looked at his stud book.

07:46.892 --> 07:48.374
He said, I don't have his name on here.

07:48.414 --> 07:49.255
Who recommended him?

07:49.335 --> 07:51.798
I said, my cousin's a farmer.

07:51.818 --> 07:52.939
He said, oh, get out of here.

07:53.915 --> 07:58.539
Well, the guy went to Baylor and made all Southwest Conference and killed us.

07:58.559 --> 08:03.224
And he made a great football player named Bob Buster.

08:03.244 --> 08:03.964
Baylor Baron.

08:04.325 --> 08:05.165
I think that's real good.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.067
We're playing Baylor sometime coming up.

08:07.147 --> 08:07.548
That's right.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.770
He should have taken your word for that.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.413
Your wife, I believe, had a job at Bryan Air Force Base also.

08:13.453 --> 08:14.474
So things were going well.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.437
Well, she had her first job over here at the old administration building.

08:17.457 --> 08:18.378
It's on the quadrangle.

08:18.438 --> 08:20.800
Pink brick building.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.222
cost from MSC.

08:22.803 --> 08:26.949
She worked in there for about $140 a month or something.

08:26.969 --> 08:28.352
I don't remember what it was.

08:28.372 --> 08:32.698
And then later on, as I got in vet school, I couldn't work as much.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.743
And so I was trying to struggle to get through that.

08:35.963 --> 08:37.425
And so we had two babies.

08:37.986 --> 08:39.809
So she worked at Bryan Air Force Base.

08:40.610 --> 08:43.034
And then she worked at the housing office.

08:43.334 --> 08:46.399
It used to be a Quonset hut over next to

08:46.379 --> 08:48.662
the College View, and she worked there.

08:48.682 --> 08:49.944
And so we all had jobs.

08:49.964 --> 08:55.311
I parked cars and tutored and graded papers and mowed lawns and worked.

08:55.331 --> 08:58.675
And the last job I had was I painted the veterinary school.

08:58.695 --> 08:59.656
Is that right?

08:59.676 --> 09:04.423
And incidentally, I was the last class that studied veterinary medicine on the campus.

09:04.583 --> 09:05.164
I see.

09:05.204 --> 09:07.867
So it was when you were here that they moved over to West Campus.

09:07.887 --> 09:13.855
I was a freshman and the seniors walked the horses and the cows across the railroad track past Loop Otson.

09:14.155 --> 09:14.896
Right on.

09:14.916 --> 09:15.217
Right.

09:15.617 --> 09:17.901
Now, after you got out of A&M, you wanted to be a veterinarian.

09:17.921 --> 09:19.182
You still wanted to be in the service.

09:19.202 --> 09:23.228
The Navy didn't really have a program to veterinarian, so you joined the Army.

09:23.248 --> 09:25.191
I joined the Army Veterinary Corps.

09:25.211 --> 09:26.433
And a fascinating career.

09:27.174 --> 09:33.143
Just start from there and just sort of talk about some of the places that you went, the things that you did as an Army veterinarian.

09:33.163 --> 09:37.890
And I think a lot of people will really be surprised of the facets of what a job of a veterinarian is.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.252
It's not just taking care of

09:39.232 --> 09:40.214
dogs and cats.

09:40.234 --> 09:44.020
There was a lot involved with that, especially as it pertained to being in the service.

09:44.080 --> 09:44.541
Talk about it.

09:44.681 --> 09:47.205
The reason, and they'll say, what do you need veterinarians for?

09:47.225 --> 09:51.291
If you think about it, what we eat is our patients.

09:51.311 --> 09:53.876
So we know more about their diseases.

09:53.896 --> 09:59.164
So we did food inspection.

09:59.650 --> 10:04.238
And we had dogs and we had horses and, you know, we were in clinics.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.542
And I taught school.

10:06.663 --> 10:14.377
I taught in the quartermaster school, I taught chemistry and dairy science and all sorts of things like that.

10:15.859 --> 10:17.322
I was...

10:17.302 --> 10:28.698
I was in biological warfare for four years at Fort Detrick, and we were studying the effects of radiation on the infectious process.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.043
The Army sent me to graduate school, University of North Carolina.

10:32.063 --> 10:32.804
I'm at Tar Heel.

10:33.205 --> 10:35.548
Got my master's from University of North Carolina.

10:36.990 --> 10:39.213
There I went to a tall school.

10:39.294 --> 10:44.541
I was in biological warfare, and I guess probably the most interesting place was the Nevada test site.

10:44.521 --> 10:49.515
They sent me out there and I was studying effects of underground testing.

10:50.176 --> 10:55.932
Strontium 90 uptake and then I'd go around and talk to farmers and ranchers about different things.

10:56.266 --> 11:04.242
I had a study one time where we were studying effects of underground testing on cows on the ground, whether it would break their legs.

11:04.282 --> 11:14.764
So I had a study where we did a bunch of cows and lined them up 700 feet from ground zero, 1,400 and 2,800 feet from ground zero with a Stanford Institute camera on them.

11:14.744 --> 11:18.271
and we blew these cows up in the air and didn't hurt them.

11:18.853 --> 11:20.536
Folks, SPCA don't get on me.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.839
We didn't hurt these cows.

11:21.859 --> 11:24.204
In fact, they were better off than I was.

11:24.224 --> 11:35.908
So I did that and then spent some time in Korea and went out on missile sites, took care of the German shepherds, had a little clinic there, and my men inspected the food.

11:36.057 --> 11:49.422
Right, now that leads us to another story to where you had to sort of stick by your guns a little bit as far as when you declared, what, 340,000 pounds of beef medically unfit.

11:49.522 --> 11:52.307
Tell us about that story and the political battle you had to fight.

11:52.468 --> 11:55.433
General Tommy Murnane, who is an Aggie,

11:55.413 --> 11:58.878
General Tommy Bernays sent me to Germany.

11:58.898 --> 12:00.260
And at the time, I didn't want to go.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.904
I wanted to go earlier than that, but my girls were in medical school.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.007
Both my twins are MDs.

12:05.047 --> 12:07.811
And they were in medical school, and I really didn't want to leave.

12:07.891 --> 12:13.118
I was a post veterinarian at Fort Jackson, South Carolina Infantry.

12:13.098 --> 12:42.885
so he said well it's time for you to go and i said okay i've been wanting to go but i didn't really want to go now so i went to germany and i was the head veterinarian for the army air force exchange system or px as we know it right and uh you say well what is he doing that i said well i had a lot to do because these veterinarians that worked for the medical i was company veterinarian i worked for the px but we had veterinarians out there worked with with surgeon general worked for the surgeon general and they inspected every

12:42.865 --> 12:46.069
thing that we ate, the troops ate.

12:46.089 --> 12:49.853
And I had an office and really hardship in Munich.

12:50.094 --> 12:51.595
Tough job, somebody's got to do it.

12:52.216 --> 12:57.763
And I had a job in Munich and a guy called me one day and he says, currently he said, we've got a problem.

12:57.783 --> 13:01.507
He says, we've got 350,000 pounds of beef.

13:01.527 --> 13:03.810
It's 50 pound box, it's frozen.

13:04.415 --> 13:13.546
And they'd take that frozen beef and dump it in a huge vat as big as that, from here to that wall, and then put soot in and ground it up and make hamburger meat out of it.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.790
And whatever was in that meat is what we ate.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.152
We didn't rework it.

13:19.172 --> 13:21.055
So it was not thawed out.

13:21.435 --> 13:23.878
It was ground up frozen.

13:23.898 --> 13:29.745
So a guy called me up and he said, we got some problem with a shipment of 350,000 pounds of beef, and I found a lot of stuff in it.

13:31.207 --> 13:33.129
And I said, okay, I'll put a medical hole in it.

13:33.149 --> 13:34.050
Well, in the Army,

13:34.891 --> 13:38.536
A veterinarian, a medical officer, when they put a hole, that is it.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.199
There's no organ.

13:40.599 --> 13:43.463
Nobody's going to go over it, but there's a lot of people that don't like it.

13:44.745 --> 13:51.755
So I went there and told the general, and I sit right through the right of the general, and I told him, I said, we got a problem with this beef.

13:52.096 --> 13:57.403
It's a government-owned product, and we own it, but I'm not going to let them use it.

13:58.124 --> 13:59.987
He says, you've got a lot of problems.

14:00.558 --> 14:06.287
But he says, I want you to hang in there and you stick by your guns because you're going to catch a lot of pressure from Dallas.

14:06.327 --> 14:07.168
That was headquarters.

14:07.308 --> 14:07.569
Right.

14:07.589 --> 14:10.613
You're going to catch a lot of pressure and you hang in there.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.318
And I hung in there for over 60 days.

14:14.299 --> 14:16.923
It was just the knockdown drag out of what we were going to do.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.086
And I knew that I was in problems.

14:19.207 --> 14:20.729
And so I better go up.

14:20.749 --> 14:23.473
And so I pulled it and checked it over and it was terrible.

14:23.673 --> 14:24.034
Right.

14:24.014 --> 14:31.567
It had cow manure in it, tea bags, bone, hair, skin, whatever else you could name.

14:31.587 --> 14:32.428
Right.

14:32.448 --> 14:35.794
And so I decided, well, that we're going to stay with it.

14:35.814 --> 14:40.902
So one day I get a call from General Tommy Murnane, good Aggie.

14:40.942 --> 14:44.889
I told you he'd been in a kiddie core, a wonderful young man, I call him.

14:45.129 --> 14:45.530
Right.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.575
He called me up and he said, Scotty, he says, what do you find?

14:48.615 --> 14:50.258
He said, I'm getting a lot of pressure from him.

14:51.082 --> 14:53.088
people back here, and he said, what did you find?

14:53.108 --> 14:59.406
And I told him, and I won't go through the whole conversation with you, but I told him what all was in there.

15:00.088 --> 15:02.736
And he said, okay, I just wanted to hear from you.

15:02.916 --> 15:04.360
And that's all I ever heard from him.

15:04.481 --> 15:04.922
And so

15:05.577 --> 15:20.514
We hung in there, and one day I get a call from my counterpart in Dallas, who was the veterinarian there, and he said, well, they took the CID out of somewhere in a veterinarian out of Camp Pope and sent them up to Bayonne, New Jersey.

15:20.534 --> 15:25.260
There was another ship ready to come over to you, another 350,000 pounds.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.863
And they pulled a sample, and guess what they found?

15:27.883 --> 15:29.805
The same thing you did, which relieved me.

15:30.866 --> 15:31.787
And...

15:31.767 --> 15:34.790
But as I told you the other day, that wasn't the end of the story.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.693
Like Paul Harvey said, that's not the end of the story.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.895
Yeah, you eventually found a home for the beef, right?

15:40.055 --> 15:41.997
We found a home over in Yugoslavia.

15:42.017 --> 15:42.938
I hate to say this.

15:42.998 --> 15:45.200
I hope this doesn't go to Yugoslavia.

15:45.220 --> 15:49.164
So they bought that beef to thaw it out and make goulash out of it.

15:49.384 --> 15:53.028
I think we sold it to them about 15 cents a pound, something like that.

15:53.048 --> 15:54.489
So the government lost money on the deal.

15:54.509 --> 15:56.051
We were always doing things like that.

15:56.231 --> 16:00.255
We made ice cream out of dehydrated fat.

16:01.484 --> 16:04.849
and powdered milk, and we'd put it together to make ice cream.

16:05.209 --> 16:19.189
So we borrowed all that stuff from Holland, different country, and I was involved with things like that where we would, in fact, I fined Holland $25,000 one time for not going by the contract, but it was a lot of fun.

16:19.169 --> 16:21.052
Indeed, indeed.

16:21.072 --> 16:27.001
When you were out east, we may be backtracking or moving forward, I'm not sure, but you were in dairy science in Virginia.

16:27.021 --> 16:31.748
You took care of the general's dogs there, and Fort Jackson, also South Carolina, too, right?

16:31.769 --> 16:33.331
Well, I was working for my good friend.

16:33.351 --> 16:36.957
If he's watching this on television, Colonel Jim Moore lives over here.

16:36.977 --> 16:40.502
He's an Aggie, and he was my boss, and we had been friends in Korea.

16:40.482 --> 16:42.308
They all tie together with it.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.435
And I was teaching school for him.

16:44.656 --> 16:48.970
He's a quartermaster, and I was teaching school for him out at Fort Lee, Virginia.

16:49.793 --> 16:51.097
And I taught dairy science.

16:52.121 --> 16:53.445
I taught chemistry.

16:53.780 --> 16:58.187
both organic and organic chemistry, to the Quartermaster officers.

16:58.207 --> 16:59.549
They were all college graduates.

16:59.589 --> 17:02.393
They were going to be food people for the Quartermaster.

17:02.473 --> 17:04.536
Quartermaster feeds everybody.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.497
So I was teaching them.

17:05.537 --> 17:17.475
And one of the minor jobs I had, which you alluded to a while ago, is I taught the generals how to take care of the general's dog, which wasn't, I want to say that wasn't my main job, but that was one of the things I did.

17:17.455 --> 17:21.440
Interesting enough, the cook that talked there had been General MacArthur's cook.

17:21.460 --> 17:21.800
Oh, really?

17:21.820 --> 17:24.343
Yeah, he was kind of a fascinating guy to talk to.

17:24.363 --> 17:24.844
I bet he was.

17:24.884 --> 17:33.694
When you were in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, I believe you said that your boss was the father of General William Caldwell, who is currently the chief military spokesman in Iraq.

17:33.714 --> 17:39.601
General Caldwell III, who was an Aggie and West Point graduate, one of the finest men I ever met, infantry.

17:39.982 --> 17:40.122
Mm-hmm.

17:41.114 --> 17:49.113
And some lady found some bad shrimp in the commissary, and she'd gotten sick.

17:49.674 --> 17:51.659
And so she didn't wait till Monday.

17:51.679 --> 17:56.490
She went over to his quarters on Sunday afternoon, and the general was back taking a nap.

17:56.555 --> 17:59.820
And he knocked on the door, and this young man answered the door.

18:00.861 --> 18:03.164
And said, well, my daddy is asleep back.

18:03.324 --> 18:06.088
And she walked right past him, went back and rousted him out of bed.

18:06.689 --> 18:09.293
And, of course, I got put on that little job on Monday.

18:10.294 --> 18:11.195
And it was a lot of fun.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.057
It wasn't anything to it.

18:12.097 --> 18:13.539
It was just some outdated stuff.

18:13.579 --> 18:15.662
And did a little epidemiology.

18:16.543 --> 18:19.467
I'm an epidemiologist, so I did a little epidemiology study on it.

18:19.487 --> 18:23.052
And she'd been drinking too much and eating too much out of the...

18:23.032 --> 18:42.643
refrigerator and it wasn't a shrimp but i took care of it and the the little boy that answered the door is general caldwell the fourth right in iraq right i saw him the other day he looks just like his father he is he's the chief military spokesman in iraq right now and his daddy was one of the finest men i ever knew indeed

18:42.809 --> 18:53.536
You eventually came back to Fort Hood and eventually back to Texas A&M, I know, where you became, retired from the Army and became the state epidemiologist for the state of Texas.

18:53.797 --> 18:55.100
So obviously a very interesting job.

18:55.261 --> 19:00.193
That was probably harder than being what I did in Germany.

19:00.595 --> 19:02.459
because I went into a problem.

19:02.479 --> 19:03.661
We were having Bruce Lottises.

19:03.902 --> 19:08.731
And I used to say it was caused by Bruce Lottis Variety Politicus.

19:08.751 --> 19:09.994
A lot of politics in it.

19:10.495 --> 19:11.497
Nobody understood it.

19:11.517 --> 19:12.358
We couldn't understand it.

19:12.378 --> 19:13.641
We were killing too many cows.

19:13.701 --> 19:18.250
And I had a professor here named Trevino who had taught me a wonderful...

19:18.618 --> 19:29.136
guy, he had a PhD in pathology, and he had recommended me for this job to, as a state, I wasn't a state epidemiologist at the time.

19:29.196 --> 19:29.437
Right.

19:29.858 --> 19:35.447
But, so I went to work for him, and I was the first board-certified epidemiologist to go to work for him.

19:35.467 --> 19:35.808
Indeed.

19:36.189 --> 19:42.139
And so, John Holcomb, who was the head man, who was an A&M graduate, and who was a senior when I was a freshman.

19:42.399 --> 19:42.820
Right.

19:43.238 --> 19:50.870
Felt like we needed to bring specialists in, had some education to work on this problem because we weren't getting anywhere.

19:50.970 --> 19:53.955
We were killing a lot of cows that we didn't need to kill.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.960
And so I didn't know anything about the disease, but I had a good background.

19:57.721 --> 20:03.711
And I had been in biological warfare and I liked bacteria and virus problems and everything.

20:04.214 --> 20:05.416
So I went to work for them.

20:05.536 --> 20:11.106
And my late of fame is I put Texas A&M under quarantine and the King's Ranch under quarantine.

20:11.166 --> 20:15.974
And I had Dolph Briscoe under quarantine and just A.J.

20:15.994 --> 20:16.395
Foyt.

20:16.595 --> 20:17.597
I worked with all of them.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.758
So you're a real popular fellow.

20:19.099 --> 20:20.882
Well, I say I put them under quarantine.

20:21.042 --> 20:23.486
Really, my job was to get them out from under quarantine.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.951
The federal government put them under quarantine.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.994
But my job was to go in there and work with them.

20:28.717 --> 20:31.062
I didn't have to go by the federal regulations.

20:31.162 --> 20:32.865
I could go by what I knew about the disease.

20:32.905 --> 20:34.749
That's what made the thing work.

20:34.929 --> 20:40.860
And it was flexible and I could write a herd plan that was customized for your ranch.

20:41.181 --> 20:44.307
I don't want to run out of time before we talk about the other facet of your career.

20:44.327 --> 20:51.501
And that was when you and your wife Lorraine actually went back to Hollywood and really haven't been back from Hollywood that long.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.282
You got into acting.

20:53.302 --> 20:54.124
You got into theater.

20:54.184 --> 20:55.105
You got into acting.

20:55.145 --> 20:56.407
You did 16 commercials.

20:56.707 --> 21:01.655
Just sort of take it from there and sort of talk about that facet that came along later in your career.

21:02.276 --> 21:06.282
Well, I was, you know, Victoria, I have a big interest in the Boy Scouts.

21:06.382 --> 21:13.552
I work with, I'm a volunteer in the Boy Scouts, and I was a scoutmaster, and I used to do drama in my court of honors.

21:13.853 --> 21:14.113
Right.

21:14.734 --> 21:15.295
And I got...

21:15.545 --> 21:33.182
to directing and then I got involved with acting I had done some acting in high school and I did a play here when I was at A&M I see Mr. Roberts I played in Mr. Roberts right over here right and so I got involved with it and one day somebody says you know you ought to make commercials so I got

21:33.685 --> 21:39.055
I got off making commercials, and my first commercial I made was in 1991.

21:39.415 --> 21:47.389
It was for an independent insurance agency, and it was the commercial that did the Houston Open.

21:47.409 --> 21:48.812
I see, yeah.

21:48.832 --> 21:54.522
It was in four spots, and that was the first commercial I ever did, and I really liked that.

21:54.682 --> 21:56.706
I really liked being on that camera, you know?

21:56.686 --> 22:00.111
And so I did another one, and then I came back here and worked some.

22:00.172 --> 22:02.075
I had an agent in Houston.

22:03.216 --> 22:08.885
And I made the, I guess the most famous one here was the Randall's Tom Thumb commercial.

22:08.946 --> 22:10.067
I was the tomato man.

22:10.468 --> 22:13.733
Had a big tomato about that big.

22:13.873 --> 22:16.538
As a matter of fact, I'll tell you what, we've got a picture from that commercial.

22:16.578 --> 22:20.624
This is a good time to go to just a couple of photographs that you supplied to us.

22:20.644 --> 22:22.507
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

22:22.567 --> 22:23.689
We've got a couple of pictures here.

22:24.023 --> 22:27.749
And you can look right there and see that's a... Well, that's a good-looking guy.

22:27.769 --> 22:29.992
That's a young Scotty Reynolds.

22:30.012 --> 22:31.474
Now, when was that taken?

22:31.494 --> 22:35.600
That was taken... You see, I'm rated.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.144
I got promoted in Guam.

22:38.164 --> 22:38.605
Right.

22:38.625 --> 22:44.073
Yeah, that was my third-class petty officer, and I was feeling my rank about that time.

22:44.353 --> 22:45.055
I bet you were.

22:45.075 --> 22:46.797
Nice-looking young sailor.

22:47.158 --> 22:47.258
Yeah.

22:47.298 --> 22:47.398
Okay.

22:47.682 --> 22:52.548
Now I think we've got, now here's sort of a photograph from that commercial that you talk about.

22:52.568 --> 22:56.132
I think people might look at that and might say, oh yeah, I've seen that before.

22:56.172 --> 23:00.096
So that was done in California, is that right?

23:00.116 --> 23:02.539
No, we shot this commercial in Chapel Hill.

23:02.559 --> 23:02.979
Oh, I see.

23:03.420 --> 23:13.251
Yeah, we shot this commercial in Chapel Hill and that tomato there, it cost, you guys are in the business, it cost $500 to fabricate that thing.

23:13.298 --> 23:17.265
But that was probably the best commercial I ever made.

23:17.305 --> 23:18.287
I worked all day long.

23:18.327 --> 23:20.050
I worked early in the morning until midnight.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.073
The thing was shot at night.

23:22.394 --> 23:28.945
If anybody remembers seeing that commercial, I think the best part of it, I was in a tomato

23:30.055 --> 23:36.081
patch and I'm getting worms off the tomatoes to show that Randall's or Tom Thumbs didn't let worms get on the tomatoes.

23:36.301 --> 23:48.394
That's one that, but I guess, as I told you, the Donkey Kong 64 commercial was shot in front of Universal Studios in Hollywood.

23:48.514 --> 23:53.419
I shot that in front of the Back to the Future, where they shot the lightning come down.

23:53.439 --> 23:54.761
I shot that in front of that.

23:54.841 --> 23:57.143
I played a Georgia

23:57.123 --> 24:00.288
State trooper with a big, smoky bear hat, and I'm up here talking.

24:00.308 --> 24:06.137
We believe there are five perpetrators, about 25 people throwing bananas and peaches behind or whatever it was.

24:06.177 --> 24:07.619
I remember that one.

24:07.639 --> 24:11.185
Yeah, and I made one for Amazon.com.

24:11.205 --> 24:16.393
We were singing Mitch Miller songs, Christmas songs on a big drum, and that was shot over on Sony.

24:17.915 --> 24:25.307
I shot one for HotJobs.com, two Texas hot tub and a big hat, and it didn't run it.

24:25.287 --> 24:28.051
There were a few of those that got left on the cutting room floor.

24:28.071 --> 24:28.431
I got clicked.

24:28.451 --> 24:29.332
I don't know what happened to me.

24:29.773 --> 24:32.096
I just got clicked on one in August.

24:32.176 --> 24:38.224
I was in Hollywood in August, and I got cast for the Secure Horizons Old Soldier.

24:38.304 --> 24:39.265
I really wanted to do that.

24:39.285 --> 24:42.189
He kind of gave a salute, and the general went by.

24:42.289 --> 24:45.473
I kind of felt like it was my life.

24:45.453 --> 24:52.483
And they had me all cast and ready to do it, and I was in Albuquerque ready to fly back and film it, and they canceled it.

24:52.503 --> 24:53.664
So I'm not very lucky.

24:54.105 --> 25:00.614
We told people from the outset that you were also an author, and I think we've got a picture of the cover of the book that you've written that we'll show folks here.

25:00.654 --> 25:01.435
There it is right there.

25:01.855 --> 25:04.499
Dr. Scotty's Health Tips for Dogs and Cats.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.401
This is a recently published book.

25:06.962 --> 25:08.324
Talk a little bit about that.

25:08.404 --> 25:10.287
Obviously, it does what the title says it does.

25:10.327 --> 25:12.810
It gives you tips about raising your pets.

25:12.790 --> 25:14.332
Well, I'm kind of excited about it.

25:14.433 --> 25:21.423
I feel like people that have dogs and cats, if they know how to take care of them, then they'll make them healthy, and they'll save them on their vet bill.

25:21.924 --> 25:28.795
And so what I've tried to teach in this book, and as I was telling you while ago, it's a textbook for the layperson.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.758
It's written as a textbook.

25:31.479 --> 25:32.601
And it's funny.

25:32.681 --> 25:38.730
I talk about a little bit of time when I was at A&M and when I was in East Texas and when I was in the Army and different times.

25:38.710 --> 25:55.511
But what I try to do is teach people how to give a physical examination once a month where they check the animal's eyes and the pulse and their breathing and the lymph nodes and the skin so they can pick up disease early and know when to go to the vet.

25:55.531 --> 26:02.980
And also it teaches them how to give CPR to a dog or a cat, how to deliver puppies.

26:03.398 --> 26:09.066
If you want to take a trip, get my book, and I'll tell you every disease or every problem you're going to have on your trip to the United States.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.648
Quite a handy book.

26:10.668 --> 26:15.675
I know that when you were in Hollywood, you got a chance to get to know people who we regard now as celebrities.

26:15.695 --> 26:20.021
I think you said you and your wife, Lorraine, were pretty good friends, went to church with Jimmy Stewart.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.923
Yeah, Jimmy Stewart was a gentleman.

26:21.963 --> 26:23.205
He was a good Christian man.

26:24.507 --> 26:29.173
He went to church every Sunday, and he just loved my wife.

26:30.595 --> 26:32.798
Jimmy was the kind of guy, when he talked to you the whole time,

26:33.368 --> 26:36.252
both your hands, and he loved to talk.

26:36.292 --> 26:39.576
He was just a gentleman.

26:39.596 --> 26:47.466
Last time I saw Jimmy, he was talking about the King James version to a friend of mine who was a choir director who happened to be a Baylor graduate.

26:47.946 --> 26:50.249
So Jimmy was a gentleman.

26:51.811 --> 26:56.898
I guess I knew him for about a year or so, and just as easy to talk to.

26:57.759 --> 27:00.422
I guess we met everybody.

27:00.402 --> 27:05.917
Just about, I've met Charlton Heston two or three times, and Marina O'Hare, and some of these people probably don't know who these people are.

27:06.498 --> 27:09.085
It was a fascinating career, but believe it or not, we're out of time.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.732
Like I said from the outset, we can go hours and hours.

27:11.752 --> 27:15.542
But thank you for your service, and thank you for just a life wonderfully lived.

27:15.522 --> 27:16.143
Thank you.

27:16.163 --> 27:16.524
Thank you.

27:16.544 --> 27:17.685
Thanks for having me.

27:17.705 --> 27:19.368
So what's next for Dr. Scott Reynolds?

27:19.388 --> 27:21.391
He's officially retired, but not hardly.

27:21.411 --> 27:23.554
He still has a passion for just about everything.

27:23.915 --> 27:32.548
His new book, his website, dogs, cats, his wife, his twin daughters, his granddaughter, and as he should be, and we are, he is proud of his service to our country.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.232
We salute Dr. Scotty Reynolds for that service.

27:35.252 --> 27:36.174
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:36.194 --> 27:38.357
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
