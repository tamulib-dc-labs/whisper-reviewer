00:10.696 --> 00:34.792
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.132 --> 00:36.214
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.105 --> 00:47.080
You're about to meet Bill Adams, A&M class of 1941, retired Colonel Bill Adams, veteran of World War II's European theater and of post-conflict Korea.

00:47.941 --> 00:54.671
The things he's done, the places he's been are nothing short of incredible, but he's had the time to do them.

00:54.691 --> 01:03.805
But now as you meet Bill Adams, you, like I did, will find it hard to believe that he's 86 years old, now married to his wife, Irelene, for 63 years.

01:04.662 --> 01:06.846
First question, Colonel Bill Adams, is how do you do it?

01:06.886 --> 01:09.652
How do you keep looking so young, 86 years old?

01:10.053 --> 01:14.742
When I came up to your house the other day, I thought I was meeting Mr. Adams' son, not Mr. Adams himself.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.844
You look awfully good for 86.

01:16.646 --> 01:17.848
You're gracious and kind.

01:18.389 --> 01:20.033
I inherited some good genes.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.536
And that's how it works.

01:22.257 --> 01:23.700
As far as I know.

01:24.136 --> 01:27.279
And a lot of great service in the military, and that's what we're here to talk about today.

01:27.339 --> 01:30.522
Let's go back to 1941, June the 7th, I believe.

01:30.582 --> 01:32.064
You graduated from Texas A&M.

01:32.324 --> 01:33.906
You didn't have much of a summer vacation.

01:34.186 --> 01:35.968
What happened that day?

01:35.988 --> 01:36.969
We had final review.

01:38.650 --> 01:47.439
After final review, I took off to San Antonio, reported on Sunday to Fort Sam Houston for one-year active duty training.

01:47.919 --> 01:50.081
That's what you thought it was going to be, one-year active duty.

01:50.342 --> 01:50.802
That's right.

01:51.136 --> 01:54.160
Back then, that's what kids did a lot.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.965
They wanted to get it done and get on with their lives.

01:57.986 --> 01:58.326
That's right.

01:58.366 --> 02:02.592
And that's what you had in mind was one year of active duty, and then you were going to get on with your life.

02:02.672 --> 02:03.633
That is correct.

02:03.653 --> 02:06.097
Talk about from Fort Sam to Fort Sill.

02:06.117 --> 02:12.806
Just sort of take us through that time up to December 7, 1941, when things kind of changed for everybody.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.048
They did.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.637
I reported to Fort Sam on that Sunday for a month interval.

02:23.030 --> 02:27.116
for whatever training I could get there with the field artillery battalion.

02:28.198 --> 02:36.210
And then I reported to Fort Sill in July, about the 8th, as I remember, somewhere along in that time frame anyway.

02:36.230 --> 02:43.401
And for a three-month battery officers course, a basic course for artillery officers coming in on active duty.

02:43.421 --> 02:47.687
I do remember that we had officers, second lieutenants, all of us,

02:48.140 --> 02:57.673
from LSU, from Oklahoma, from Colorado, from Ohio State, Purdue, Michigan State.

02:57.693 --> 03:00.477
I believe Yale had someone there in that course.

03:01.399 --> 03:04.783
That was about a three-month course.

03:04.803 --> 03:11.533
And then I was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

03:11.553 --> 03:14.837
They were on maneuvers down in South Carolina, and I joined them down there.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.421
We came back, and

03:18.734 --> 03:32.026
We're turning in all of our old howitzers, our World War I French 75-millimeter howitzers for the new 105-millimeter howitzers.

03:32.046 --> 03:36.170
And then the balloon went up.

03:36.190 --> 03:36.751
Indeed.

03:36.771 --> 03:40.374
You said that on December the 7th, I guess you were at Fort Bragg, and that was a Sunday.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.336
It was kind of a day off for you?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.717
That was Sunday, definitely.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.158
It was a day off.

03:45.819 --> 03:48.201
I was down in the motor pool washing my car.

03:48.772 --> 03:55.242
had the radio on, and then when life changed for lots of us.

03:55.262 --> 03:55.763
Indeed.

03:55.783 --> 03:58.427
I want to backtrack a little bit and then go beyond December the 7th.

03:58.567 --> 03:59.929
Let's go back to Fort Sill.

04:00.390 --> 04:07.320
Your expertise from the very beginning, you wanted to be a ground soldier, and you were being educated in field artillery.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.302
Is that right?

04:08.322 --> 04:08.902
Yes.

04:08.922 --> 04:11.927
Field artillery.

04:12.565 --> 04:16.352
At A&M in ROTC, that was the branch that I had chosen.

04:16.933 --> 04:23.565
And yes, that was my branch of choice throughout my service, the field artillery.

04:23.806 --> 04:24.547
Right.

04:24.567 --> 04:32.722
I guess back then there were some A&M students that maybe thought the more glamorous life was being a flyboy, but that never appealed to you as much, right?

04:32.782 --> 04:34.685
No, not that.

04:34.926 --> 04:35.046
Uh-uh.

04:35.245 --> 04:39.832
And after I got into an armored division later on, no way would they get me out of it.

04:40.694 --> 04:45.982
December 7th, 1941, again, changed the lives of the entire world.

04:46.002 --> 04:48.806
How did it change Billy Joe Adams' life?

04:50.389 --> 04:58.461
Well, I didn't have July 7th, 1942 to look forward to being back in Texas.

05:01.326 --> 05:02.147
We were...

05:03.595 --> 05:32.168
in training there of course and it began to intensify greatly and I never will forget one time we were out in our little training area and they somebody came by and told us all your trucks have been moved but we order you to move those howitzers back down yonder somewhere by hand and these were definitely larger howitzers than we had been accustomed to and that

05:33.717 --> 05:36.880
That was the last day that I wore my A&M boots.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.022
You lost your A&M boots.

05:38.102 --> 05:39.343
How'd you do that?

05:41.225 --> 05:51.075
Through all of the physical exercise, physical activities of that day, my legs just swelled up and I had to cut my boots off.

05:52.096 --> 05:57.582
And in those days I didn't think much else about it, just that's life and we go on.

05:58.810 --> 06:05.376
Now, I believe following the chronology of this, you went back to Fort Sill, is that right, as an instructor?

06:07.638 --> 06:24.835
We had finished our battalion training exercises, and that was essentially leading us overseas, but received orders to report back to Fort Sill as an instructor in the officer candidate school there.

06:25.473 --> 06:34.813
This was either the end of February or the first part of March of 1942, and I was assigned to the tactics department at that school.

06:35.454 --> 06:44.072
And we trained officer candidates, some from enlisted ranks and some who had, well,

06:44.322 --> 06:54.413
all from the listed ranks really, but some who had not had any previous ROTC experience and some who had had previous ROTC experience.

06:54.533 --> 07:01.160
So we had some that knew what they were doing and some just completely raw people that had no idea what they were doing.

07:01.300 --> 07:01.721
That's right.

07:02.562 --> 07:04.003
And you had to teach them all.

07:04.143 --> 07:06.986
Qualifying them for overseas duty, this was the idea, right?

07:07.727 --> 07:09.469
Qualifying them for whatever

07:10.445 --> 07:15.212
was on out there, and overseas was the primary part that was on out there.

07:15.553 --> 07:22.444
You joined the 20th Armored Division, went to Camp Campbell, Kentucky, and this was a battalion that you stayed with until the end of the war.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.445
Talk about your next move.

07:24.928 --> 07:28.673
1943, March the 15th.

07:30.356 --> 07:35.564
I reported on Organization Day to the 20th Armored Division.

07:35.584 --> 07:38.629
Major General Stephen G. Henry had a speech that day

07:39.132 --> 07:42.696
The Ides of March, beware Hitler, the Ides of March are upon you.

07:43.977 --> 07:54.568
I was assigned as a battery commander of a battery, the full 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, stayed with that battery for about a year and a half.

07:56.329 --> 08:07.941
And we had to train two cadres to go out to form other armored artillery battalions, for in our case, batteries, of course.

08:08.444 --> 08:13.212
We got all of that done and then we were doing our own preparation.

08:14.434 --> 08:21.185
We also had some other training exercises that we had to do, that motorcycle deal.

08:23.489 --> 08:25.913
In the armor division,

08:26.652 --> 08:31.677
We had, of course, tanks and half tracks and all sorts of vehicles.

08:32.158 --> 08:39.085
And the officers had to be qualified to serve, to drive each and every kind of vehicle that we had.

08:40.046 --> 08:48.074
So we got some experience at driving every form of vehicle, and one of them at that time was motorcycles.

08:49.436 --> 08:51.198
I had never been on one in my life.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.203
And I took two turns at it.

08:57.263 --> 08:58.885
And they said I was qualified.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.127
You were an expert.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.869
I was an expert.

09:02.911 --> 09:12.423
A period of time later, the colonel said, Adams, we have to train some motorcycle riders to go overseas.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.987
You are the designated one.

09:16.148 --> 09:21.455
So having been on one twice, I then had that opportunity to train some.

09:21.535 --> 09:22.757
To teach others how to do it.

09:24.599 --> 09:25.060
But I was...

09:25.411 --> 09:30.116
just primarily in charge, I had to get really qualified people.

09:30.916 --> 09:42.388
I even found one in our headquarters battery who would teach them how to fall to save their legs and everything else in case of that type of accident.

09:42.408 --> 09:47.813
We completed that training, turned all the motorcycles back to all of the units that we'd borrowed them from.

09:48.814 --> 09:50.756
Most of the vehicles were in pretty good shape.

09:51.016 --> 09:52.077
Some of them weren't so good.

09:53.103 --> 09:57.109
And I reported back to the battalion commander and said, sir, training is complete.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.492
They're all ready to go.

09:59.512 --> 10:03.438
He reached over and got a little piece of paper and showed it to me.

10:03.458 --> 10:07.063
War department had removed motorcycles from all armored divisions.

10:08.485 --> 10:14.653
Except those that were overseas, the commanding general, of course, had the opportunity to keep them if they so desired.

10:14.674 --> 10:15.735
It was up to them.

10:16.205 --> 10:19.748
Well, you probably trained some future civilians to ride motorcycles.

10:20.409 --> 10:23.172
And they probably had a blast doing it, I guess.

10:23.192 --> 10:27.716
This was getting kind of late in the war when you were there.

10:28.036 --> 10:31.600
Did you think that you were going to spend the entire war stateside eventually?

10:31.640 --> 10:33.301
Or did you think you'd ever be going overseas?

10:33.382 --> 10:34.122
Eventually you did.

10:34.142 --> 10:34.943
We'll talk about that.

10:35.023 --> 10:38.727
But what were you thinking then?

10:38.747 --> 10:41.910
I was wanting to get those cadres out of the way so we could get overseas.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.191
Exactly.

10:44.673 --> 10:54.745
I don't know, in so many of our minds, to pursue the war properly, we had to get there and be a part of it.

10:54.765 --> 11:04.175
And it was a great relief when, yes, we got the cadres trained and went through our own training and preparation for overseas movement.

11:06.478 --> 11:14.427
And somewhere along in there also, our battalion commander was ordered overseas as an individual replacement, so

11:14.795 --> 11:25.294
Some of us got to move up, and in the fall of 1944, I moved up and was the battalion operations officer for the 14th for the rest of the time.

11:25.443 --> 11:29.529
In January of 45, you were sent overseas.

11:29.609 --> 11:29.909
Yes.

11:29.929 --> 11:31.591
You qualified for overseas duty.

11:31.612 --> 11:35.637
This was actually as the Battle of the Bulge was going on or just wrapping up.

11:35.978 --> 11:37.219
Wrapping up at that time.

11:37.399 --> 11:44.850
February 45 is when you joined as a support, you believe, for the 82nd around Cologne.

11:45.310 --> 11:45.551
Yes.

11:45.571 --> 11:46.312
Talk about that.

11:49.056 --> 11:52.160
One of the axioms for artillery is that they are not held in reserve.

11:52.400 --> 11:52.801
Right.

11:52.821 --> 11:53.762
They are...

11:54.856 --> 12:01.164
And as much as they don't normally close with the enemy, they just use them because of their firepower.

12:02.406 --> 12:15.742
And so we went up a little ahead of the division and moved into position just on the west side of the Rhine River and just a bit north of Cologne.

12:15.782 --> 12:20.188
We could see the towers and the spires in Cologne on good days.

12:20.759 --> 12:28.227
and we reinforced the fires of the 82nd as they were holding the West Bank.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.891
The 82nd was not in an offensive mode at that time.

12:31.931 --> 12:35.835
They were merely holding, securing the West Bank of the Rhine.

12:36.515 --> 12:39.158
You were an operations director.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.000
You directed operations for the battalion.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.922
I was the operations officer for the battalion.

12:43.082 --> 12:44.203
And you were in a half track.

12:44.243 --> 12:45.805
That was your mode of transportation.

12:45.953 --> 12:46.494
Yes.

12:46.514 --> 12:49.077
So essentially, you were sort of the director of the battalion.

12:49.117 --> 12:51.340
If this had been a movie, you'd have been the director of it.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.963
You sort of made the decision sort of what you do next?

12:54.584 --> 12:55.825
In that context, yes.

12:56.006 --> 13:06.299
All fire missions either came through or were approved by my office, if you can call it an office, a group of people.

13:06.980 --> 13:14.509
Some of them rather perfunctory approval, and sergeants could do that, and others I would have to be involved.

13:14.978 --> 13:26.615
I was involved in the planning and the disposition of the artillery as it supported the various other units when we went back to our division and those operations.

13:26.635 --> 13:36.930
So all of the operations, movement, fire, everything like that did come through my section, yes.

13:36.950 --> 13:42.117
You experienced some resistance, some combat during this time, but then you talked to me about...

13:42.502 --> 13:44.264
when you were moving into Munich.

13:44.284 --> 13:46.627
It was a pretty hectic and a scary day.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.951
Talk about that.

13:50.351 --> 14:09.994
From Cologne, we moved southeast across the Danube River, and we were back with the entire division at that time, and we were headed toward Munich, and we were working with the 42nd Infantry Division.

14:13.079 --> 14:17.665
And things didn't go exactly as we planned that day.

14:19.648 --> 14:20.309
On the Autobahn.

14:20.629 --> 14:21.470
On the Autobahn.

14:22.111 --> 14:35.770
There was one of the tank companies on the north side of the Autobahn ran into a German anti-tank school.

14:35.790 --> 14:38.253
And they lost 15 or 17 tanks that day.

14:40.697 --> 14:40.977
And

14:42.340 --> 14:53.351
As we were moving, I decided that we should pull off and establish a little headquarters rather than just the communications that we had in the half-track.

14:56.014 --> 14:57.776
And I didn't do right.

14:58.937 --> 15:10.609
I didn't follow some of the stuff that I had taught previously at Fort Sill about reconnaissance and pulled off into a bog and got my half-track stuck.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.464
Eventually, I had to get the battalion record to pull me out.

15:15.666 --> 15:29.085
But as we were there and operating, then we got our direct experience with some German 88-millimeter guns.

15:29.405 --> 15:31.408
Because you were bracketed by the enemy.

15:32.950 --> 15:35.834
There was a short, then an over, and a right, and a left.

15:37.857 --> 15:39.820
That's when I told everybody,

15:40.559 --> 15:43.183
you better start digging somewhere.

15:43.203 --> 15:52.537
And I got under my half-track, and just a little bit back, Orianna, was where it all landed.

15:53.218 --> 16:01.170
That German officer jumped his bracket, as we would call it in the American Army Field Artillery.

16:01.190 --> 16:04.896
He flat-jumped his bracket, and I made it out all right.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.396
And you made it to Munich and on to Salzburg.

16:08.416 --> 16:12.662
It wasn't easy to get there because a lot of the bridges, I guess, on the Autobahn had been destroyed, right?

16:12.682 --> 16:16.348
Practically every bridge was destroyed on the Autobahn.

16:16.528 --> 16:20.694
And some of them were high and the stuff was wide.

16:21.395 --> 16:26.001
And they had to get into Salzburg itself.

16:27.804 --> 16:31.609
We went to, I think it was about 12 miles north.

16:32.230 --> 16:37.799
to be able to cross the river to get over into Austria and come on back down to Salzburg.

16:38.339 --> 16:40.483
We didn't stay in Austria all that long.

16:40.543 --> 16:44.469
We came back eventually, very shortly, really.

16:44.489 --> 16:46.272
Right, right.

16:46.292 --> 16:54.785
We're going to talk more about not only your service in World War II, but then eventually when you retired, then came back and served in post-conflict Korea.

16:54.805 --> 17:00.313
But I want to go to some photographs if I can to sort of give people an idea of what

17:00.968 --> 17:06.315
what Billy Joe Adams looked like back in 1941 and beyond there.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.758
Here you are right here.

17:08.879 --> 17:10.240
When was this taken?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.283
Young, good-looking soldier then.

17:12.303 --> 17:15.868
Yeah, a lot younger looking there than now.

17:15.988 --> 17:16.449
Not much.

17:16.689 --> 17:20.915
That was at Fort Sill when I was in the officer candidate school.

17:22.317 --> 17:26.122
We had been out, and I was probably a first lieutenant then.

17:26.943 --> 17:30.047
We'd been out on an overnight operation at

17:30.938 --> 17:36.367
Toward the end of their schooling there at Fort Sill.

17:37.128 --> 17:40.193
And that was one of the last exercises that we went out on.

17:40.213 --> 17:41.776
And that was taken at that end.

17:42.557 --> 17:43.579
It had rained that night.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.342
That was a horrible night.

17:45.362 --> 17:46.243
But we made it.

17:46.463 --> 17:46.884
They made it.

17:47.104 --> 17:47.445
So on.

17:48.185 --> 17:50.008
Look at that picture and some of the ones we're going to see.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.773
You look like the Hollywood prototype soldier there.

17:54.153 --> 17:58.880
Here's another photograph as we move a little bit on into your career.

17:58.900 --> 17:59.521
Talk about that.

17:59.561 --> 18:00.222
Where was it taken?

18:00.242 --> 18:01.604
You look a little tired in that picture.

18:02.064 --> 18:05.009
That was the day we went into Munich.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.674
It had been a long or short or whatever night.

18:09.114 --> 18:11.197
Not much sleep.

18:11.217 --> 18:12.900
Kind of cold.

18:12.920 --> 18:13.641
Getting hungry.

18:14.221 --> 18:14.682
That was

18:15.370 --> 18:17.894
It's usually my breakfast in my hands there.

18:17.914 --> 18:22.861
So this is after the episode of when you'd gotten stuck in the half track.

18:22.881 --> 18:23.702
No, that was before.

18:23.742 --> 18:24.744
That was the day of.

18:24.764 --> 18:25.866
Oh, this was the day of.

18:25.886 --> 18:27.007
That was the morning off.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.793
We were going into Munich that day.

18:32.175 --> 18:41.569
And all of our plans had been made, all of our support operations in place, ready to move forward.

18:41.589 --> 18:41.850
Yeah.

18:42.711 --> 18:44.213
There's my half track.

18:44.480 --> 18:49.645
You were tired in that picture that we just saw, but coming up here, we're going to take a look at another one.

18:49.685 --> 18:50.145
There you are.

18:50.606 --> 18:55.330
Now, you look a little happier in that picture, and you're sitting on the bumper of your half-track.

18:55.350 --> 18:56.571
Yeah, that's my half-track.

18:56.591 --> 19:08.462
That's where what I rode in the primary port from near Rouen, France, up through Belgium to Cologne, and then on down to Salzburg.

19:10.003 --> 19:11.785
Very, very dependable vehicle.

19:12.306 --> 19:13.947
How many soldiers did a half-track carry?

19:15.985 --> 19:32.443
I only had about five in mind because I had to have my radio operator, no, two operators actually, and the driver, and then I had one or two sergeants with me as time went on.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.424
Right, right.

19:33.444 --> 19:34.665
They were very dependable vehicles.

19:34.705 --> 19:35.406
They had to be.

19:35.426 --> 19:36.007
Oh, yes.

19:36.988 --> 19:44.155
As far as the war in Europe, you won the war with that vehicle, right?

19:44.175 --> 19:44.676
That was...

19:44.909 --> 19:56.885
my mode of transportation, and that contained all of my communications equipment to communicate with the batteries and some of the forward observers and some of the support units.

19:57.706 --> 19:58.888
So, yeah.

19:58.908 --> 20:03.234
Colonel Adams, you were awarded two bronze stars during your service.

20:03.254 --> 20:09.983
You make it plain that neither one was for valor, but for doing your job and doing it well, and here you are being awarded one of them.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.084
Talk about that picture.

20:11.805 --> 20:12.486
That was at

20:12.888 --> 20:29.595
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, when I was a student at the Command and General Staff College, and the deputy commandant was pinning that on me for my service in Korea with the 9th Corps artillery.

20:29.615 --> 20:32.400
So that was the second one.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.605
I never did get a picture of the first one.

20:36.462 --> 20:39.306
It was a proud day for you.

20:39.326 --> 20:52.165
The final picture that we're going to show, I want you to talk about this picture, what it represents, and then another story that when you saw this picture again that it reminded you of.

20:53.266 --> 20:56.250
This is obviously as a young girl holding a white flag.

20:56.331 --> 20:59.075
Go ahead, tell the story of this and the other story.

20:59.695 --> 21:06.385
This young lady, four, maybe five years old, with a stick,

21:07.208 --> 21:17.903
with a white flag on top, surrender, and look at that face and you know that she really does not know what is happening to her world.

21:18.905 --> 21:24.172
And you just want to get out and hug her and tell her that everything will be all right.

21:24.192 --> 21:25.755
But you don't know what all is out there.

21:25.995 --> 21:27.197
What town was this in?

21:27.217 --> 21:27.617
I don't know.

21:28.238 --> 21:30.261
I can't remember the town.

21:30.922 --> 21:36.490
But I will venture to say that second or third or fourth vehicle that came on by there

21:36.655 --> 21:39.459
Some GI gave her a bar of candy.

21:40.821 --> 21:45.669
The GI do that to those girls, to those kids.

21:45.689 --> 21:53.140
But when you see that, you also get a remembrance of some other things that happened.

21:53.921 --> 22:03.135
One time in one town, some of our headquarters people rounded up some young boys.

22:04.972 --> 22:07.455
And the next thing I knew, one of them was crying.

22:07.475 --> 22:11.639
And he was 10, 11, 12, somewhere along in that age range.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.344
And I asked the Sergeant Major what that was all about.

22:16.364 --> 22:21.749
And he said, well, this one is a member of the Hitler Youth Organization.

22:22.710 --> 22:29.877
And his leader had given him a Panzerfaust and told him that he had to shoot an American tank.

22:30.998 --> 22:33.561
And he had not fired his Panzerfaust.

22:34.182 --> 22:41.670
Now, a Panzerfaust is a shoulder-fired weapon, and it was deadly to some American tanks if it hit in the proper place.

22:42.391 --> 22:49.759
But he was very, very upset that he was not getting to fire his Panzerfaust at an American tank.

22:49.779 --> 22:54.123
Needless to say, he never did, at least not while we were around there.

22:55.044 --> 23:01.992
And we rounded up all the weapons that we could find in that town that day and destroyed them.

23:02.012 --> 23:03.193
No, we turned them over to them.

23:04.220 --> 23:09.047
ordnance disposal, really, but tried to get them all disabled and under control.

23:09.828 --> 23:16.037
Well, the children of the war in Germany and everywhere, these are the stories certainly that you remember.

23:16.057 --> 23:29.816
And you look at that young girl that we saw the picture of, and you just hope that A, she survived, and B, that she grew up to have kids and grandkids of her own, as you do, and was able to tell stories like you do.

23:29.836 --> 23:32.640
That was some 60 years ago.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.120
She would be 65 now.

23:36.462 --> 23:38.965
I hope she has made it this long.

23:38.985 --> 23:39.546
I hope so too.

23:39.946 --> 23:41.128
We're going to move along here now.

23:42.650 --> 23:52.261
You retire from the Army in 1945, but then three years later in 1948, you re-up and talk about your second tour.

23:52.281 --> 23:53.363
I did one slight correction.

23:53.483 --> 23:54.364
I did not retire.

23:54.444 --> 23:56.046
I just was relieved from active duty.

23:56.066 --> 23:57.268
Relieved from active duty.

23:57.448 --> 23:57.788
Okay.

23:57.908 --> 23:59.630
And then 1948, you got back in.

24:00.031 --> 24:01.733
I was in Houston.

24:03.046 --> 24:10.597
And in the active reserves, I was assigned to a battalion out of the 90th Infantry Division, as I best remember.

24:11.719 --> 24:19.410
And the situation with Russia just became very tense.

24:21.673 --> 24:29.264
And at summer camp, I chose to go to summer camp 1948 up at Fort Sill for two weeks.

24:30.526 --> 24:32.108
And it was up there that I decided that

24:33.218 --> 24:35.661
I should go back in the Army.

24:35.681 --> 24:36.903
I had enjoyed the Army.

24:37.764 --> 24:38.525
I liked that life.

24:40.668 --> 24:48.719
I was qualified, and I was greatly concerned about the situation that we faced.

24:49.440 --> 24:56.910
So I volunteered, applied to go back on active duty, was accepted and sent immediately to Germany.

24:56.930 --> 25:02.517
And while I was in Germany, I was accepted into the regular Army.

25:03.222 --> 25:04.724
no more of that reserve business.

25:05.925 --> 25:10.110
We're starting to run out of time, and that's too bad, but we still have some time.

25:10.130 --> 25:17.598
And I want to talk about you eventually did go to Korea just as the conflict was starting to wind down.

25:17.678 --> 25:24.766
And talk about you were still there because there's always had to be a contingency in case things heated up again in Korea.

25:25.527 --> 25:28.230
And that was one of the things that you were there for.

25:28.250 --> 25:28.471
Yes.

25:28.651 --> 25:32.335
I went over as an individual replacement, not into any unit.

25:33.260 --> 25:40.050
And when we got on the ship at Oakland Army Base, the war was still on.

25:40.150 --> 25:42.794
When we got to Japan, they had signed a truce.

25:43.875 --> 25:52.167
But it still went on, and I was assigned as the intelligence officer of the 9th Corps artillery.

25:52.187 --> 26:02.322
And as such, my primary duty at that time was down at Corps headquarters, integrating all of the planning of the Corps artillery with the

26:02.588 --> 26:04.791
activities of the other units of the Corps.

26:05.712 --> 26:24.435
And that was a very rewarding but very, very demanding time, keeping all of that coordinated and keeping my commanding general informed of all of the plans and actually getting his approval for it too.

26:24.455 --> 26:28.360
And it was very, very rewarding.

26:28.643 --> 26:43.958
Eventually, after Korea, you spent about 11 months in Korea, and then you were stationed at the Pentagon, where, talk just real quickly, because we are running out of time, your job there at the Pentagon, as it pertained to moving troops into educational situations.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.500
Yeah.

26:45.520 --> 26:56.811
At the Pentagon, I was in charge of selecting officers to go to the commanding general CF college, and also nominating

26:57.466 --> 27:03.898
the field artillery officers to go into higher level schooling, Army War College and National War College and so on.

27:05.061 --> 27:14.479
And also for officers who wanted to go into civilian schooling to further their education so that then they could

27:15.202 --> 27:40.247
make a better more efficient contribution into some specialized area within the army that the army wanted and needed there's so much more to tell about that story but we took a lot of time telling the telling the great stories that you did and you went on to Tulane and you taught at Texas A&M and thank you very much for your service thank you sir thank you Bill Adams pleasure to be here and thank everybody for this

27:41.122 --> 27:42.323
program.

27:42.423 --> 27:42.744
You bet.

27:42.964 --> 27:43.464
Thank you, sir.

27:44.165 --> 27:49.990
From Texas A&M to Fort Sill, to Fort Bragg, back to Fort Sill, then to Camp Campbell, to Germany, to Austria.

27:50.471 --> 27:56.457
Retires, re-ups, then later back to Europe and then to Korea, back to the States, to the Pentagon.

27:56.477 --> 28:00.400
And that was all before Colonel Bill Adams started his teaching career at Texas A&M.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.803
A full life and still going strong.

28:02.823 --> 28:04.945
We salute Bill Adams and all veterans.

28:05.045 --> 28:08.148
Please thank a veteran today.

28:08.168 --> 28:10.690
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

28:11.328 --> 28:12.490
I'm Tom Turberville.

28:12.510 --> 28:15.574
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:18.538 --> 28:39.529
That's it.
