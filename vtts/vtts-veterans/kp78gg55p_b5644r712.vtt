01:25.790 --> 01:33.528
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

01:33.548 --> 01:42.568
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

01:42.588 --> 01:43.530
First National Bank.

01:43.550 --> 01:44.693
First, always.

01:52.587 --> 02:16.447
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

02:16.908 --> 02:17.970
I'm Tom Turbyville.

02:18.642 --> 02:24.369
Lieutenant General John H. Miller and his wife, Virginia, have lived in their college station home for 10 years.

02:24.389 --> 02:27.253
And before you say that's not all that long, well, consider this.

02:27.673 --> 02:32.339
When they moved here, by his count, it was their 37th move of their married life.

02:32.900 --> 02:39.969
Such is the life of this career Marine who served his country in three wars, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.

02:39.989 --> 02:47.839
He calls his service not all that distinguished, but it was indeed distinguished enough to earn three Purple Hearts, two Bronze Star Medals,

02:48.005 --> 02:51.811
Two Legions of Merits, and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

02:51.831 --> 02:53.333
And that's just to name a few.

02:53.353 --> 02:57.138
It is my honor to welcome General John H. Miller to Veterans of the Valley.

02:57.158 --> 03:01.024
General Miller, it is indeed an honor to have you here.

03:01.044 --> 03:05.891
You call your service not all that distinguished because you say you're not a hero of these wars.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.135
You say who the heroes were.

03:08.175 --> 03:10.017
I want you to talk about that.

03:10.037 --> 03:13.843
Well, the heroes are the guys that are not with us right now.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.909
I don't consider myself a hero.

03:16.929 --> 03:20.152
I've never jumped out of a perfectly good airplane.

03:20.212 --> 03:22.274
I've never jumped out of one that was damaged.

03:22.874 --> 03:27.078
I didn't have a ship that went down from under me.

03:27.899 --> 03:34.324
I have led a reasonably charmed life through my military career.

03:34.585 --> 03:35.385
Right, right.

03:35.886 --> 03:40.230
Forty years, though, you were in the Marines, so you were a career guy all the way.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.051
Yes, I have a long career.

03:42.231 --> 03:42.852
Right.

03:43.422 --> 03:45.184
And I would say that it is distinguished.

03:45.224 --> 03:45.605
Let's go back.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.006
You were born in San Angelo.

03:47.066 --> 03:55.476
You went to high school in Axtell, Texas, and you went to A&M in 1942, but you just stayed about a year or so and enlisted in the Marines.

03:55.517 --> 03:57.639
Sort of talk about the start of your military service.

03:58.540 --> 04:02.465
Well, I came to A&M, as you say, in June of 1942.

04:02.725 --> 04:08.933
Young 17-year-old, just off the farm.

04:09.934 --> 04:10.054
Right.

04:10.861 --> 04:17.390
And got my first taste of a little bit of military in the Corps, plus all the harassment that went along with that.

04:18.731 --> 04:30.407
And I learned a little, but I was, like a lot of the youth at that time, I was eager to get into the fray.

04:31.108 --> 04:34.672
The war was going on, and the whole country was behind the war.

04:35.113 --> 04:40.480
You know, all of the things that we've always go back and think about, the rationing, the

04:40.983 --> 04:42.124
Everybody going.

04:42.144 --> 04:48.572
Everybody from 18 to 36 years old was either drafted or volunteered.

04:48.592 --> 04:52.136
And I thought that the best place to go was the Marines.

04:52.517 --> 04:57.402
I saw some Marines that were going to radio school here at that time, and they looked very sharp.

04:57.483 --> 04:59.084
And I said, that's the outfit I want to get in.

04:59.885 --> 05:04.611
So when it came up time to register for the draft, I volunteered to go in the Marine Corps.

05:04.962 --> 05:06.484
Talk about your World War II service.

05:06.564 --> 05:11.391
You served stateside, also in Okinawa, and eventually in Japan as part of the occupation.

05:11.872 --> 05:22.507
Well, I went to boot camp, which was a piece of cake having gone through a year, almost a year and a half of training here.

05:22.668 --> 05:28.216
I knew the rifle, I knew a little bit about drill and all this sort of stuff.

05:28.236 --> 05:34.665
And I really wanted to get into an infantry or tank or something like that, that's it.

05:35.219 --> 05:57.936
I got assigned to radar school, and I didn't even know what radar was at that time, but I went on and went through almost about nine months of radar school training to become a radar technician operator, radio technician operator, and so forth, and then was assigned to the Marine Aviation

05:58.405 --> 06:16.802
in which when I did go overseas, I was with a Marine Air Group, Marine Air Group 31, initially in the Marshall Islands, and then they made the landing in the operation in Okinawa when that took place in, I guess, 1941.

06:17.828 --> 06:24.935
on the 1st of April, 1945, that they landed, as I recall.

06:24.955 --> 06:31.081
And then that was not, that's why I say we're not distinguished about this.

06:31.462 --> 06:35.586
All I was doing, we had a few long-range artillery.

06:35.606 --> 06:37.428
We had a couple of raids by the Japanese.

06:38.289 --> 06:43.414
We had a couple of commando raids on the airfield, but nothing,

06:43.968 --> 06:44.609
sensation.

06:44.649 --> 06:47.433
I wasn't in any great danger.

06:47.453 --> 06:55.423
Then I went up to Japan for the occupation and stayed there for about six months, came home and was discharged.

06:56.425 --> 06:59.489
By the fall, I was ready to come back to A&M.

06:59.589 --> 07:06.658
So I came back, changed my major from an agricultural major to electrical engineering, got a degree in 1949.

07:06.858 --> 07:13.367
In the meantime, had gone to Officer Candidate School at Quantico

07:13.972 --> 07:19.542
Uh, kind of as a hedge, uh, if I get called back again, I'm going to go back as an officer.

07:19.622 --> 07:30.682
Although I'd made staff sergeant in this time and during World War II, which was kind of a, uh, unique in that, uh, promotions didn't come that fast.

07:30.702 --> 07:38.275
Uh, so then, uh, also then upon graduation,

07:39.233 --> 07:48.167
looking at the job opportunities, the offers that I got for a junior engineer, they were $230 or $40 or $50 a month.

07:48.908 --> 07:50.511
And I said, the Marine Corps pay that much.

07:51.493 --> 07:57.542
So I talked it over with my wife and we decided to give the Marine Corps a try.

07:57.562 --> 08:01.629
I said, I can go into the Marine Corps and I can retire before I'm 40 years old.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.672
I can have another career.

08:03.871 --> 08:06.173
Your wife, Virginia, you all had gotten married, I guess, in 1947.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.236
We got married in 1947.

08:09.457 --> 08:10.418
When you were in school.

08:10.438 --> 08:11.980
When I was in school here.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.102
This was a girl that you'd gone to the first grade with, right?

08:14.522 --> 08:21.430
We originally met in the first grade at Axel School, a small rural consolidated school.

08:21.450 --> 08:24.293
I guess there were about 20 in our first grade class.

08:24.874 --> 08:31.180
But we separated somewhere along the line and didn't get back together until after World War II.

08:31.441 --> 08:31.701
Right.

08:32.002 --> 08:39.414
You decided to stay in the Marines, and that's when you started your officer service because you got your second lieutenant commission when you graduated from Texas A&M.

08:39.434 --> 08:44.702
And then the Korean War broke out, and this is what you call pretty much your big war.

08:45.203 --> 08:52.575
Talk about your service in the Korean War and specifically about being part of the first wave to land the shore at Incheon.

08:53.467 --> 08:57.851
Well, the Korean War started about two weeks after I graduated from basic school.

08:58.512 --> 08:58.632
Right.

08:58.652 --> 09:09.702
And we were ordered directly without delay to go to Camp Pendleton to form up what amounted to the first Marine Regiment.

09:10.663 --> 09:16.048
And I would say we pulled people together, had a very short time for training.

09:16.068 --> 09:18.190
We trained on a ship on the way to Japan.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.853
We got to Japan, reloaded, and made the Incheon landing.

09:22.289 --> 09:26.494
By that time, we were a pretty good, I thought, pretty good group.

09:26.574 --> 09:29.437
I was the machine gun platoon commander at this time.

09:29.537 --> 09:35.484
Rifle company had three rifle platoons, machine gun platoon, and a mortar section.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.208
And so we landed at Incheon.

09:39.949 --> 09:45.896
As I mentioned, Incheon landing wasn't all that difficult.

09:46.436 --> 09:51.402
It wasn't like Evo or Tarawa or something like that.

09:51.837 --> 09:59.067
The issue there was timing, getting over the mudflats at high tide, which we did.

10:00.008 --> 10:07.618
And I guess I got my first taste of bullets flying by, but no real big thing.

10:07.659 --> 10:16.090
And in a period of about, I've forgotten, but in less than two weeks, we had moved all the way on through

10:16.643 --> 10:20.166
Kimpo Airfield and N2 and taken Seul.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.107
Right.

10:21.648 --> 10:35.621
And we came upon a significant opposition but most of it was North Vietnamese and they weren't as tough an opposition as it later turned out that the Chinese were.

10:35.941 --> 10:36.882
Right.

10:36.902 --> 10:42.007
It was though in Korea that you did earn three Purple Hearts that were awarded as a Purple Heart with two stars.

10:42.847 --> 10:45.570
Talk about what you can and what you want to about

10:46.293 --> 10:53.782
what happened to where you had the, you got the... Well, I got the first one in Seoul when we were going through the city.

10:53.822 --> 10:56.485
And I think it's where the Seoul University is now.

10:56.525 --> 11:05.977
I was on a hill and a grenade landed at my feet and a piece of the fragment hit me on one cheek and cut a little hole there and so forth.

11:05.997 --> 11:13.506
But it wasn't anything significant in requiring a thing other than a bandage and then move on.

11:13.526 --> 11:14.747
So that was...

11:14.947 --> 11:16.729
A very, very minor one.

11:17.650 --> 11:26.980
We, as I say, after the soil operation, we were pulled out and went around to one son and eventually wound up at the Chosen Reservoir.

11:27.881 --> 11:30.203
Again, I was fortunate.

11:31.204 --> 11:33.647
I was in the 1st Marine Regiment.

11:34.348 --> 11:41.916
I had one battalion at the sort of the base of the reservoir, the southern end of the reservoir, and that was the battalion I was with.

11:42.385 --> 11:50.617
We had another battalion about 10 miles down the road, a place called Cotaree, which was where the regiment headquarters was.

11:50.717 --> 11:59.009
And then we had another one at the foot of the pass, which guarded the main supply route.

12:01.492 --> 12:09.844
We were the furthest north of that regiment, but the guys that had the tough time were the 5th and the 7th Marines that were up on the western side of the reservoir

12:10.297 --> 12:19.006
place called Udamni, and were being urged to attack to the west to link up with the Eighth Army that had come up through Ponyang.

12:20.147 --> 12:23.691
Of course, the Chinese hit at that time and disrupted everything.

12:23.731 --> 12:29.356
They cut all the supply lines, both between units and behind units and everything else.

12:30.097 --> 12:35.723
So we were isolated in about four different groups.

12:37.264 --> 12:39.747
So it was a matter of turning around and

12:40.250 --> 12:44.778
fighting our way back out to the sea so we could get aboard a ship and get out.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.282
As I say, I was never concerned.

12:49.526 --> 13:00.285
Maybe I didn't see the big picture, but we were never concerned because we had some good units, knew what they were doing.

13:01.026 --> 13:03.490
We had control of the skies.

13:04.364 --> 13:21.148
And right there at the Haggar River, the engineers came in and the dirt, frozen dirt, they built a little airstrip about 4,000 feet long and we flew out thousands of casualties as well as bringing in replacements.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.914
So I did get my second Purple Heart there.

13:25.414 --> 13:34.067
I was working with a battalion executive officer and with a ragtag group of people to secure a hill that

13:34.756 --> 13:40.368
sort of dominated the eastern part of the perimeter and got shot through the shoulder.

13:40.448 --> 13:44.016
And so I got a second Purple Heart there.

13:44.336 --> 13:44.457
Right.

13:44.477 --> 13:47.643
Your third Purple Heart, you were wounded by some mortar fire.

13:47.663 --> 13:50.790
And that was later on after we'd gone back down to

13:51.496 --> 14:02.227
Mason, Pusan, Mason reorganized and going back up through the central part, what I think the history calls the great gorilla hunt.

14:02.387 --> 14:09.935
And we were looking for stray in North Vietnamese and then, of course, moved on up.

14:09.955 --> 14:17.423
And of course, by this time, then the Chinese were coming on down and had recaptured Seul and were coming down through the central part of Korea.

14:17.443 --> 14:21.047
So we again engaged the Chinese and then

14:22.208 --> 14:31.857
Then I got hit by a mortar round that went through one arm, hit me in the side of the head, took me out of the wharf.

14:31.877 --> 14:36.381
Yeah, damaged the face, permanent vision damage.

14:36.401 --> 14:42.767
Yeah, broke all the bones in the round eye socket and then took the central vision out of that eye.

14:42.887 --> 14:51.034
So Correa was done for you then, and you went and did some recuperation, I believe, in Corpus Christi, and this was just the start of sort of one movement after another.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.055
I just, well, I get back to

14:54.372 --> 14:58.096
through the hospital system back to Corpus to the hospital there.

14:58.977 --> 15:06.865
I was mobile, and all I had was, and I also broke my arm.

15:06.885 --> 15:15.154
I had an arm in a slant, what do you call it?

15:16.416 --> 15:24.244
Anyhow, I went over to the Marine barracks there and said, hey, can you give me a job?

15:24.865 --> 15:26.627
And they gave me the permanent officer of the day.

15:27.889 --> 15:38.223
So I took care of the guard duties during the day and said a routine, whatever came up during the night.

15:38.863 --> 15:44.491
I was in the pecking order there for the night duty.

15:45.452 --> 15:51.019
Then we got into, I went to McAllister, Oklahoma, went to China Lake, California.

15:51.039 --> 15:54.484
I got into the guided missile program, first guided missiles at the Marine Corps.

15:54.937 --> 15:56.018
came up with.

15:56.078 --> 15:58.961
It was a surface-to-air missile called a Terrier.

15:59.762 --> 16:10.193
We later had two battalions, a Marine, medium anti-aircraft missile battalions.

16:10.894 --> 16:13.397
And we had two battalions of 29 Palms at one time.

16:14.298 --> 16:21.365
I then went from this unit, which was a test unit, on up to postgraduate school of Monterey.

16:21.706 --> 16:23.948
Right, right.

16:24.299 --> 16:29.064
Your travels, as a matter of fact, you told me in your 40-year career you never spent more than three years in any one place.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.366
Well, Monterey was one of the longest times.

16:31.386 --> 16:32.867
I was there three years.

16:32.887 --> 16:33.728
You were there three years.

16:33.748 --> 16:35.410
Roughly three years, maybe a little less.

16:37.172 --> 16:48.863
Going where General Miller was stationed, he talked about China Lake, California, Monterey, Washington, D.C., what, four different times, I guess, you were in Washington, D.C., right, before your career was over.

16:49.323 --> 16:50.965
Camp Pendleton, back to Okinawa.

16:51.299 --> 16:56.667
In September of 63, and this was really your first exposure to Vietnam when you went there in 63, right?

16:56.848 --> 16:57.088
Yes.

16:57.488 --> 16:57.889
Right.

16:58.069 --> 17:00.854
I went there in 63 with an infantry battalion.

17:00.894 --> 17:07.784
I was the S-3 operations officer, and we operated out around Okinawa.

17:07.844 --> 17:12.572
We didn't get engaged with anybody because there wasn't any enemy at that time.

17:12.592 --> 17:14.775
We were in training, and we were, of course...

17:15.143 --> 17:19.605
In readiness there, we went to Japan for training at Camp Fuji.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.394
We went to the Philippines.

17:21.414 --> 17:23.685
We were embarked aboard ships of the Seventh Fleet.

17:24.121 --> 17:30.749
as a special landing force, and we made all the livery ports, Hong Kong and places like that.

17:32.211 --> 17:53.858
But then we came back, and that's somewhere along there was when the Gulf of Tonkin started, and they mounted out a brigade of which we were a part, and we went down and steamed around off the coast of Da Nang for it seemed like months or so.

17:54.732 --> 18:02.183
And that was the first time that I had an opportunity to go into Da Nang because we did have some marine helicopter units there at the time.

18:02.263 --> 18:08.092
So we were able to go in and liaison with them and see what the land looked like.

18:08.112 --> 18:11.257
But in the meantime, our battalion was ready to come home.

18:11.377 --> 18:14.321
We had finished our 13-month tour.

18:15.102 --> 18:18.968
So they sent us back to Okinawa and sent us home back to the States.

18:19.572 --> 18:33.655
And I then went to Fleet Marine Force Pacific as a staff officer and made numerous trips to Vietnam over my, well, almost three years there.

18:33.675 --> 18:33.955
That's right.

18:33.975 --> 18:35.638
You were based in Hawaii then, right?

18:35.658 --> 18:44.432
I was based in Hawaii, but I was kind of instrumental in developing a logistic support for the total force in Vietnam.

18:44.750 --> 18:56.204
I want to talk more about that later, but I want to go ahead and go to some pictures right now, some photographs that are hanging in your garage wall, as a matter of fact, that you love this, and I want to go to some of them and let you talk a little bit about some of the pictures.

18:56.605 --> 18:57.586
First of all, what are we looking at here?

18:57.606 --> 18:59.228
You're on the right on that picture.

18:59.308 --> 18:59.969
Talk about that.

18:59.989 --> 19:08.119
That's me on the right and my two good buddies from the battalion in Korea, Bob Needham and Wayne Hall.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.302
Bob's in the middle and Wayne Hall's on the right.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.209
We were all platoon leaders.

19:12.229 --> 19:13.732
We were all in the same basic class.

19:13.792 --> 19:21.243
We all went out and joined the same company together, and we talked together, and we're still good buddies to this day there.

19:21.844 --> 19:26.812
Bob Needham lives in Pensacola, and Wayne Hall lives in New Hampshire.

19:27.353 --> 19:28.054
Great feature.

19:28.074 --> 19:29.456
Okay, let's move on.

19:30.257 --> 19:35.185
This is a photograph taken of you at a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.909
Well, one of my jobs as a

19:39.526 --> 19:50.120
as Lieutenant General was to be the Deputy Chiefs of Staff for plans, policies, and operations at Headquarters Marine Corps, which is also known as the Op Dep of the Marine Corps.

19:50.140 --> 19:55.446
So we met, the Op Deps always met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

19:55.466 --> 19:59.652
Sometimes they dismissed us when they had something real secret they wanted to talk about.

20:00.152 --> 20:03.677
But normally we met as we did here, and you see,

20:04.180 --> 20:23.697
me at the end of the table there, along with the Commandant of the Marine Corps at that time, General Robert H. Barrow, and going on around is the Air Force op-dep and the Air Force Chief of Staff, and then the gentleman to the right there is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

20:24.277 --> 20:26.819
Right, and that whole table is surrounded by people.

20:26.919 --> 20:31.183
And the whole table on the other side of the Air Force and the Navy.

20:31.423 --> 20:33.765
Okay, let's move on to the next photograph.

20:34.049 --> 20:37.092
That's me getting promoted to lieutenant general at Quantico.

20:37.152 --> 20:43.197
I'd gone down there as a major general and then eventually got promoted to general, my wife on the right.

20:43.317 --> 20:53.667
And again, General Bob Barrow, a great friend of mine and a great mentor of mine, at that time the commandant came down to do the promotion.

20:53.727 --> 20:53.927
Right.

20:53.947 --> 20:55.008
1979, I believe.

20:55.068 --> 20:55.528
That's your wife.

20:55.548 --> 20:55.708
Right.

20:56.549 --> 20:56.849
OK.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.992
Move on.

21:00.052 --> 21:00.913
That's a good picture.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.195
That's reviewing a cadet corps.

21:03.631 --> 21:08.639
At A&M, General Arm Simpson there between the two Marines.

21:10.261 --> 21:14.868
Once I made Brigadier General, he called me up and he says, I want to get you down to review the Cadet Corps.

21:14.968 --> 21:17.111
So he did a couple of times.

21:17.712 --> 21:21.117
And this was, I think, the first time I came down.

21:21.177 --> 21:23.501
I believe that I was Brigadier General at that time.

21:23.821 --> 21:27.006
Jack Ivins is the Marine Colonel on the right there.

21:27.425 --> 21:34.855
And General Simpson and the corps commander, the cadet corps commander is on my right there.

21:36.577 --> 21:37.999
Okay.

21:38.019 --> 21:43.747
I think that was the Clemson game in about 1970-something.

21:43.767 --> 21:44.307
I'm not sure.

21:44.868 --> 21:48.693
Here's another time that you're a little bit later with Dr. Frank Vandiver.

21:48.713 --> 21:49.675
Of course, you're on the left.

21:49.795 --> 21:55.963
Yeah, that's me and the president of the university and again, Arm Simpson.

21:56.382 --> 22:11.467
and the Marine General TC commander and were laughing because the cleanup crew from the Parsons Cavalry had just passed through the reviewing stand and presented arms.

22:11.807 --> 22:13.971
I see.

22:13.991 --> 22:17.597
They had saluted you while they were pushing their wheelbarrows.

22:17.617 --> 22:17.957
Okay.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.343
That's a picture of me and

22:22.353 --> 22:34.450
either Denmark or Norway, I've forgotten, we ran exercises over there when I was FMF LAMP every winter in order to get cold weather training.

22:36.192 --> 22:46.326
One of the jobs of the Marines was to be ready to respond to any kind of a Warsaw Pact move into the Norway or Denmark area.

22:46.987 --> 22:49.170
And that's me with

22:49.876 --> 22:55.223
walking around looking at some of the troops as they were in place there.

22:55.864 --> 22:56.164
OK.

22:57.646 --> 22:57.886
Move on.

22:57.906 --> 23:00.089
I think we've got the final picture, I believe.

23:00.109 --> 23:01.491
That's just your official photograph, right?

23:01.511 --> 23:09.421
That was my official photograph from the headquarters of the Marine Corps taken somewhere back about 1970-something.

23:12.425 --> 23:12.885
All right.

23:14.327 --> 23:17.571
Good-looking soldier.

23:17.787 --> 23:18.348
move on.

23:18.368 --> 23:26.918
Your service in Vietnam, it talked a little bit about more when you went back to Vietnam and what was involved there.

23:28.279 --> 23:30.962
Well, as I say, I went back to Vietnam.

23:33.345 --> 23:42.255
I mentioned earlier that I had just come from an overseas 13-month tour back at the headquarters FMF PAC and spent several years there.

23:44.017 --> 23:44.638
It wasn't

23:45.293 --> 23:46.976
time to go back.

23:47.076 --> 23:55.290
I think I would have liked to have gone back and had a year's tour there and had a chance to get an infantry battalion and so forth.

23:55.951 --> 24:10.997
But the commandant had decreed that no one would go back into Vietnam until his time, his dwell time, so to speak, I guess is a new term, was

24:11.399 --> 24:25.964
had been accomplished, so I went to the 2nd Marine Division from FMF LAMP, which was at Camp Lejeune, and Arm Simpson was the Divinity Commander, and he let me have a battalion.

24:26.405 --> 24:36.242
I had a battalion for a year, and we deployed to the Caribbean and had a lot of exercises there as well as in North Carolina.

24:36.847 --> 24:38.429
And then I went to the Army War College.

24:38.709 --> 24:39.750
And now it's my time.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.991
In Pennsylvania, right?

24:41.092 --> 24:41.532
That's right.

24:42.113 --> 24:43.094
In Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

24:43.154 --> 24:48.099
Now it's my time to go back to Western Pacific and to Vietnam.

24:48.579 --> 24:49.000
And I did.

24:49.080 --> 24:53.945
But I knew that I wasn't going to get an infantry battalion, certainly not right away.

24:54.045 --> 25:03.175
So I asked if I couldn't go to this Force Logistics Command, which I had been primarily instrumental in creating as an

25:03.442 --> 25:04.944
action officer, staff officer.

25:04.964 --> 25:06.046
Well, that's definitely that.

25:06.746 --> 25:09.190
So that's where I went.

25:09.210 --> 25:16.339
And I became the H&S battalion commander there, which was a grandiose job.

25:16.399 --> 25:21.867
I had probably about 3,000 or so troops, but most of them were working with somebody else.

25:21.887 --> 25:27.054
So they were just mine for administration and care and cleaning.

25:27.074 --> 25:33.162
But I'd also had the security for a substantially large area around the

25:33.884 --> 25:37.770
installation there as well as out into the villages.

25:39.953 --> 25:41.455
But I didn't get to finish that tour.

25:42.737 --> 25:52.071
I got ordered up to Okinawa to be the Chief of Staff from Marine Corps Base Camp Butler, serving for this General Barrow that I just showed you.

25:52.212 --> 25:54.475
He had just made Brigadier General and he

25:54.927 --> 26:01.576
requested that I come up to be as Chief of Staff, and so being a good Marine, I went.

26:01.857 --> 26:22.605
I didn't particularly, I really wanted to finish my tour in Vietnam, like a few months of that, but I went up there, and as it worked out, I went from an unaccompanied tour to an accompanied tour, meaning I could bring my family out, which consisted by this time only of my wife and young daughter,

26:23.007 --> 26:25.752
General Miller, we're really running short on time.

26:27.154 --> 26:28.977
Unfortunately, we've got just a couple of minutes.

26:29.318 --> 26:39.615
I know that in your last command, you were commanding General Marine Amphibious Force in Norfolk, Virginia, and it was during this time in the early 80s.

26:39.848 --> 26:44.972
that the terrorist attack in Beirut that killed 220 Marines.

26:45.593 --> 26:48.616
241, as a matter of fact.

26:48.776 --> 26:51.718
And probably some have died of wounds.

26:51.738 --> 27:01.286
The greatest disappointment of my whole career, or certainly that we lost those Marines.

27:01.327 --> 27:06.171
And as I mentioned, I was there just a couple of weeks before this happened.

27:06.231 --> 27:08.893
I didn't see anything wrong with the security setup and the

27:09.295 --> 27:11.997
manner in which they were deployed.

27:12.058 --> 27:15.240
It wasn't to our lacking.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.244
We wouldn't have done that, but this was where we were told to set up.

27:19.604 --> 27:27.011
We would have gotten a tactical high ground if it had been, but we were told to secure the airfield.

27:28.272 --> 27:36.400
It wasn't a tactical sort of thing that you would do, but that had nothing to do with the terrorist attack.

27:36.700 --> 27:36.940
Right.

27:37.173 --> 27:42.498
and a terrorist attack was just a prelude to what's been going on since then.

27:42.818 --> 27:48.363
And we learned some lessons, and we learned some very tough lessons from that.

27:48.904 --> 27:52.347
Forty years, if you had to do all over again, would you?

27:54.509 --> 27:55.810
I'm glad you asked that question.

27:56.951 --> 27:58.012
The answer is yes and no.

28:00.114 --> 28:03.117
Yes, I would do a lot of the things.

28:03.157 --> 28:04.378
I'd join the Marine Corps again.

28:05.019 --> 28:06.640
I would marry the same girl I married.

28:07.261 --> 28:15.470
But if you ask somebody a question, would you do all these things like you did before, like you did?

28:17.312 --> 28:18.053
The answer is no.

28:18.393 --> 28:22.518
And anybody that is thinking would have to say no.

28:23.299 --> 28:25.641
That means that you didn't learn anything from your experience.

28:27.003 --> 28:28.404
And you learned from experience.

28:29.005 --> 28:36.052
It's interesting that in the military, you only get to do the job you're doing one time.

28:36.213 --> 28:36.593
Yes, sir.

28:37.332 --> 28:46.042
Then you are generally elevated and you're going up the ladder, you know, and so you've got to learn from experience.

28:46.062 --> 28:48.505
You've got to learn from the experience that you get.

28:48.785 --> 28:51.168
You've got to learn from the troops that you're leading.

28:51.208 --> 28:58.817
You've got to learn from your seniors so that when you're a company commander, you can look up and say, hey, when I'm a battalion commander, I'm going to do it this way.

28:59.397 --> 29:00.859
So there's a lot of...

29:01.531 --> 29:02.192
A lot of things.

29:02.713 --> 29:04.756
We're out of time.

29:04.776 --> 29:05.037
I'm sorry.

29:05.057 --> 29:05.197
Okay.

29:05.598 --> 29:07.380
I wish we could keep going, but we're out of time.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.624
Thank you for your distinguished service.

29:09.644 --> 29:10.005
Thank you.

29:10.145 --> 29:10.866
General John Miller.

29:11.066 --> 29:16.655
And we do thank General John Miller for his distinguished service, and we thank him and salute him as we salute all veterans.

29:16.976 --> 29:18.258
Please join us next time.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.260

29:31.670 --> 29:44.616

First, always.

30:39.423 --> 30:40.925

30:44.129 --> 30:44.930
Going for 30 seconds?

30:47.493 --> 30:49.455

Lieutenant General John H. Miller served 40 years in the United States Marines and served his country in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.

32:07.130 --> 32:13.277
He was awarded three Purple Hearts, two Bronze Star medals, and even the Distinguished Service Medal from the Navy.

32:13.297 --> 32:17.622
I'm Tom Turbeville, inviting you to meet one of the Brazos Valley's most distinguished veterans

32:18.007 --> 32:25.314
General John H. Miller, on Veterans of the Valley, Friday at 8.30, Saturday and Sunday at 6.30, right here on KAMU-TV.

32:38.367 --> 32:41.991
Flubba-dub for the Christmas party, yeah.

32:42.011 --> 32:44.233
That was good, thank you very much.
