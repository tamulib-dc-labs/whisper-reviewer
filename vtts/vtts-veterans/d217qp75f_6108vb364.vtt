Bank for more than 143 years providing banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:07.749 --> 00:16.108
Gratefully acknowledging the veterans who served our country in the past and proudly supporting the soldiers who currently serve in our military.

00:16.128 --> 00:19.255
First National Bank, first, last, always.

00:26.322 --> 00:50.482
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:50.502 --> 00:51.604
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:52.445 --> 00:57.811
Dick Davidson does not dwell on the ribbons and medals that passed him by for his service in World War II.

00:58.352 --> 01:03.298
As you will discover, PFC Davidson was a soldier not looking for recognition.

01:03.318 --> 01:07.082
He was a fighter, simply looking to defeat the German enemy.

01:07.102 --> 01:13.710
A ground soldier, and as he'll admit, an independent thinker who didn't always go along with the conventional ways.

01:13.690 --> 01:18.174
What he saw along the way is incredible, an incredible story, and he's here to tell it.

01:18.535 --> 01:21.037
Dick Davidson, it is a pleasure to have you here.

01:21.057 --> 01:24.400
And we've got a long story to tell about your service in World War II.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.504
And let's start with you as a young man, 16 years old, I believe.

01:28.564 --> 01:31.687
You upped and then went to VMI.

01:31.707 --> 01:35.110
So you were a young, young man when you sort of started this journey of service.

01:35.131 --> 01:40.896
Yeah, really, I joined the Home Guard when I was 16 there in Marlin, Texas, where I was born and grew up.

01:40.876 --> 01:49.711
And then as soon as I graduated from high school, barely 17, I went off to Virginia Military Institute, where I finished a year at what they called a gross rat.

01:49.731 --> 01:51.114
That was a messy rat.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.560
Rats for freshmen in Virginia Military.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.463
Then I joined the reserves.

01:56.483 --> 02:01.652
And I did this so that I could participate in what they called the Army Specialized Reserve Training Program.

02:01.632 --> 02:17.975
which was military again, but it was at Baylor this time, and I finished a quarter there, but in the meantime, I had become 18 years old on the 3rd of April, and on the 13th of May, 40 days later, I was inducted into the Army at Camp Walters up here at Mineral Wells, Texas.

02:17.995 --> 02:24.003
Right, and then you went to Camp Walters, and then you went to Alabama for training, is that right?

02:24.023 --> 02:28.770
Yeah, Fort McClellan, Alabama, where I did the conventional and 17 weeks of infantry basic,

02:28.750 --> 02:35.459
where they wasted time on close order drill, bayonet practice, and military courtesy to do the most difficult and dangerous job in the world.

02:35.899 --> 02:40.605
We talked a little bit about how you didn't always agree with the conventional ways, and this is an example of it.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.489
You told me that close order drill has nothing to do with fighting a war.

02:43.569 --> 02:44.450
Neither does a bayonet.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.812
I used it to open cans.

02:45.832 --> 02:51.419
But look, I have a rifle that will shoot eight rounds as fast as I pull the trigger, and I can reload in two or three seconds.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.121
What do I need with a bayonet?

02:53.506 --> 02:59.066
Anyway, I finished that and I did not go right overseas like most of the men because I was still 18.

02:59.448 --> 03:02.318
And they were trying to give 18 year olds a little bit delay.

03:02.720 --> 03:11.650
So after a 10-day, what they call a delay in route, I was sent to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where the 70th Division was just getting ready to go overseas.

03:11.670 --> 03:12.932
So I had a few weeks with them.

03:13.472 --> 03:19.299
Then we shipped out, went to Boston, where after a few days there, we were loaded on what once was a luxury liner.

03:19.580 --> 03:20.861
It was the USS America.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.404
Very fine, fast ship.

03:23.684 --> 03:26.888
They had a whole battalion of us in what used to be the luxury lounge.

03:26.868 --> 03:51.762
we had aisles about this deep to put all our gear in and we slept four deep on bunks about this wide so they had i think something like eight or ten thousand soldiers on that boat and how long was the trip nine days and we went all by ourselves it was a fast ship and they thought it on that southern route that they probably wouldn't have any trouble with sun with submarines but destroyer picked us up outside of gibraltar and escorted us through gibraltar and into the mediterranean

03:51.742 --> 03:54.306
And then a day or two later, we landed in Marseille.

03:54.927 --> 04:00.156
And incidentally, we landed on the 15th of December, 1944, that would be.

04:00.697 --> 04:04.603
And the Battle of the Bulge started on the 16th of December, 1944.

04:04.804 --> 04:06.066
The very next day.

04:06.086 --> 04:13.478
I want to go back to your first joining the 70th Infantry Division and what we talked about sometimes you not being going along with the conventional way.

04:13.899 --> 04:16.483
You had an assistant squad leader that you didn't see eye to eye with.

04:16.463 --> 04:20.028
I would call it really a vendetta.

04:20.368 --> 04:24.033
We not only didn't get along, we saw how much misery we could deal each other.

04:24.093 --> 04:38.353
Now you might think that I wouldn't have much chance against a sergeant, but what I discovered was if you can make things miserable for them because you cannot demote a private and you can't court-martial anyone for being stupid.

04:40.223 --> 04:42.665
So I had him pulling out his hair all the time.

04:42.685 --> 04:52.435
But anyway, what happened was, is after we landed in France, they put us on the boxcar and shipped us up to Alsace, where the 7th Army was.

04:52.455 --> 04:54.717
Far from the bulge, by the way.

04:54.737 --> 05:01.104
And we marched up to the front one dark night with the guns flashing in the distance, but we didn't actually go to the front.

05:02.065 --> 05:05.488
And the next day or the day after, the captain called us out.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.886
And he gave us this little talk.

05:06.906 --> 05:10.699
He said, men, I really hoped we were going to all go into battle together.

05:11.261 --> 05:15.776
But you know, they're having a lot of trouble up north and they need some replacements.

05:15.856 --> 05:18.465
And so we ordered to send a bunch of men up there.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.332
I knew I would be selected.

05:20.753 --> 05:27.666
So I hurried back, and by the time the assistant squad leader got there to tell me I'd been selected, I was already packed up and ready to go.

05:27.766 --> 05:29.469
So I never let him win a single one.

05:29.649 --> 05:31.212
He was as happy about that as you were.

05:31.232 --> 05:32.274
We were both happy.

05:32.294 --> 05:32.935
Both happy about that.

05:33.136 --> 05:36.522
So anyway, they loaded us on an open truck in the dead of winter.

05:36.502 --> 05:42.472
And for about 16 hours, including nearly all night in sub-freezing weather, we rode in that truck.

05:42.492 --> 05:47.782
And by the time we got up there in Luxembourg, it was so cold that we were numb.

05:48.022 --> 05:51.388
But fortunately, they took us to this castle.

05:51.571 --> 05:52.693
And the castle was warm.

05:52.713 --> 05:56.999
Now, we had to sleep on the marble floor, but it was really wonderful.

05:57.019 --> 05:58.541
And we slept there during the night.

05:58.561 --> 06:09.157
And the next day, we came out to be sent to our respective units, because we were replacements to replace the rather enormous casualties that had been suffered in the Battle of the Bulge.

06:09.177 --> 06:10.339
Right, right.

06:10.657 --> 06:13.621
So you were in the 2nd Battalion, 318th Infantry.

06:13.682 --> 06:15.484
Yeah, but let me tell you how that happened, though.

06:15.504 --> 06:16.406
That's fascinating.

06:16.426 --> 06:18.449
That's one of my favorite stories, by the way.

06:18.869 --> 06:25.600
We came out, and there was just hundreds of men, just to go in this one division, hundreds and hundreds of men.

06:25.620 --> 06:29.966
A captain stood up on the hood of the jeep and started calling out names.

06:30.447 --> 06:37.778
And after quite a while of doing this, he stopped, and he said, the rest of you men are in the 2nd Battalion, 318th Infantry.

06:38.669 --> 06:42.077
We looked around and there was a battalion standing there.

06:42.097 --> 06:46.328
Obviously that battalion had just been almost annihilated.

06:46.348 --> 06:52.122
And so one poor guy held up his hand and he said, Captain, what are our chances?

06:53.587 --> 06:58.677
The captain looked at him and said, most of our casualties are lightly wounded.

06:59.319 --> 07:05.932
And what he was saying was, not if you get it, but when you get it, there's a pretty good chance it won't be too bad.

07:05.952 --> 07:13.047
I mean, that's relative, of course, but it means that it won't be life-threatening or maiming, or that you won't be killed.

07:13.027 --> 07:16.192
actually about 20% of our casualties were killed.

07:16.493 --> 07:27.792
And really, probably a good half, or what you would call lightly wounded, in the sense that the person could spend a few weeks or a month or two in the hospital, and then he'd have the luxury of being sent back to the front again.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.520
And boy, that was awful then, because you knew what you were getting into.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.242
Now, you were in Company G, I believe.

07:34.263 --> 07:41.333
Company G. And this was a company that, if I remember you telling me right, had been the company that was the first to land at Bastogne.

07:41.353 --> 07:41.873
Is that right?

07:42.354 --> 07:43.796
Actually, my whole battalion.

07:43.876 --> 07:47.601
In fact, we got a presidential citation after the war was over for this.

07:47.622 --> 07:49.084
They broke through to Bastogne.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.589
And my particular company had been just decimated.

07:53.189 --> 07:57.816
Out of 120 riflemen full strength, there were about 20 left.

07:58.572 --> 08:04.806
I think a full strength platoon is 40 men, and I think my platoon had maybe five.

08:05.407 --> 08:10.519
And they pumped 30, along with me, about 30 replacements came in.

08:10.619 --> 08:11.821
None of us knew each other.

08:12.102 --> 08:13.425
For that reason,

08:13.591 --> 08:17.296
I call us band of strangers, not band of brothers.

08:17.316 --> 08:18.498
And this is really typical.

08:18.558 --> 08:24.986
People don't know this, but for an infantry unit that's been in battle for quite a while, this is typical.

08:25.006 --> 08:29.592
The casualties are so heavy that most of the men don't really know each other.

08:29.913 --> 08:38.604
They come up as strangers, and you don't even know that you want to get to know them very well because chances are either you or they are going to be gone in a few days or weeks.

08:39.726 --> 08:40.527
See, I lost...

08:41.536 --> 08:45.406
Three foxhole buddies in two months.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.256
And of that, really only about six weeks was hard fighting.

08:49.276 --> 08:49.718
Right.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.881
And I lost three.

08:50.901 --> 08:51.021
Right.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.826
I was on my fourth when my turn came.

08:53.187 --> 08:53.448
Right.

08:53.768 --> 08:54.611
Because I was lucky.

08:54.651 --> 08:55.673
I didn't get wounded.

08:55.854 --> 08:56.676
We'll talk about that.

08:56.757 --> 09:03.946
You were a rifleman, but you were on what is regarded as the front of this operation, of this battle.

09:04.127 --> 09:20.368
One of my great prides, Tom, is that many, many times when I and the men next to me took one step forward or crawled one yard on our bellies, the power of the United States advanced one yard because there was nothing between us and the enemy.

09:20.348 --> 09:23.295
That was true time and time and time again.

09:23.315 --> 09:23.655
Indeed.

09:24.658 --> 09:24.758
Yeah.

09:24.778 --> 09:25.780
Wow.

09:26.702 --> 09:31.994
You said that at this time, initially, you were at a relatively quiet part of the Battle of the Bulge.

09:32.014 --> 09:32.114
Yeah.

09:32.134 --> 09:34.940
But then you said pretty much all you did is dug trenches and get shell.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.163
To me, that's not quiet.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.165
Well, it is from infantry.

09:38.185 --> 09:39.066
You see what had happened?

09:39.126 --> 09:49.919
We'd been so decimated, having to digest all those troops, that they did put us on what was a relatively quiet part of the southern flank of the bulge, nearer city of Edelbrook, Luxembourg.

09:50.339 --> 09:54.604
And that is basically what we did for 17, 18 days.

09:54.624 --> 09:56.907
We did locate them in about three different positions.

09:57.207 --> 09:58.449
In fact, one, two, three, four.

09:58.809 --> 10:01.212
We actually were in four separate positions.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.716
But during that time, I only knew of one man that was killed.

10:05.116 --> 10:05.897
He was dug in.

10:06.367 --> 10:12.736
turned out dug in under a tree, and a German shell hit the tree, and a shell fragment came down in the hole and killed him.

10:12.756 --> 10:15.539
But that's the only man that I know of that was killed.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.883
But let me tell you how you get after a while.

10:18.403 --> 10:29.418
Before that 17 or 18 days was over, I began to welcome the shelling at night because it was required that in each foxhole one man stay on guard all night long.

10:29.438 --> 10:31.621
So we took turns.

10:31.641 --> 10:34.585
In case the German showed up, he would wake all up and down the front.

10:35.105 --> 10:44.317
But if they were shelling you, you knew the Germans weren't going to show up because they would be out in the open, you in a hole, so they would be in much more danger than you were.

10:44.337 --> 10:44.657
Right.

10:44.677 --> 10:45.839
So I could sleep.

10:45.859 --> 10:46.560
Exactly.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.482
So when they were shelling you, you could sleep.

10:48.502 --> 10:49.744
How do you like that one?

10:49.824 --> 10:50.685
It doesn't make much sense.

10:50.705 --> 10:51.966
You got waked up pretty often.

10:51.986 --> 10:55.611
Every time there was a close one, you generally... I'm sure it made sense at the time.

10:56.973 --> 11:04.302
You told a story, and I'll let you retell it, and we'll be delicate about it, but one of your first experiences with incoming fire...

11:04.282 --> 11:07.086
was when you had a bad meal and nature called.

11:07.266 --> 11:07.566
Right.

11:07.867 --> 11:12.894
I had a bad meal of which we got many because the cooks brought up filthy food for us.

11:12.934 --> 11:15.617
In fact, we got well when we didn't eat their cooking.

11:15.777 --> 11:16.018
Right.

11:16.378 --> 11:23.708
But anyway, nature called and I jumped out of my hole and only ran a hole just no farther than halfway across this room, you know.

11:23.823 --> 11:30.991
And I got done, and I headed back to my hole, and just as I jumped in, whaow, bam, and hit came a shell, landed right by our hole.

11:31.371 --> 11:34.735
And I know he only fired one time, so I was the target.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.277
You were the sole target of that German artillery.

11:36.297 --> 11:36.817
I was the sole target.

11:36.837 --> 11:38.199
Yeah, most people don't have that honor.

11:38.479 --> 11:43.845
Most infantrymen don't have the honor of attracting enemy artillery fire.

11:43.865 --> 11:44.746
But I know what happened.

11:44.766 --> 11:49.071
This guy's sitting over there bored and needed some entertainment, and he found a target all of a sudden.

11:49.709 --> 11:57.137
But it takes time to call it in and get the range, and by then, by the time the shell got there, I got back to my hole at just about the same time.

11:57.657 --> 12:02.003
We moved past the new year into 1945 around mid-January 18th or 19th.

12:02.864 --> 12:08.692
Your unit decided or your leaders decided to attack a German town just to pick a fight.

12:08.712 --> 12:09.353
Talk about this.

12:09.694 --> 12:12.458
That is, I think that was insane.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.200
We were not given any information.

12:14.320 --> 12:21.110
Now the platoon leader may have been, but here I am getting ready to attack a town at night and I don't know what the street layout is.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.652
I don't know anything.

12:22.632 --> 12:24.575
And here we are, going to go over there and pick a fight.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.619
That's just asking to be mangled.

12:26.639 --> 12:29.765
Well, it turned out we got mangled without picking a fight.

12:29.785 --> 12:40.924
What happened is, we're heading across no man's land, snow about this deep, and all of a sudden, about as far as here to that ladder, no farther than that, suddenly, right in front of me, boom!

12:42.066 --> 12:44.691
I was so close that powder from it stung my face.

12:46.392 --> 12:47.233
I hit the ground.

12:48.214 --> 12:54.981
I heard this poor kid right beside me, about this far, gurgling what turned out to be his last breaths.

12:55.001 --> 13:04.251
I didn't know it at the time, but my foxhole buddy, who was about as far behind as, again, 8 or 10 feet or 15 feet maybe, had been hitting the leg and wounded.

13:05.412 --> 13:06.593
But I didn't know what it was.

13:06.633 --> 13:09.016
That's how little they had taught me in basic training.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.258
I didn't realize it was a mine.

13:11.358 --> 13:16.163
I thought maybe it was a shell, though I should have realized that there was no whistle.

13:16.598 --> 13:24.364
Anyway, I lay there with my face in the snow and somebody else apparently panicked and started running because it was blam, blam, blam.

13:25.002 --> 13:25.583
And that was it.

13:26.243 --> 13:27.685
Well, somebody said, let's get out of here.

13:27.745 --> 13:30.388
And I stood up, and I was going to go forward.

13:30.408 --> 13:33.452
And fortunately, somebody saved my neck and said, those are mines.

13:34.012 --> 13:36.415
So I turned around and started backtracking out.

13:36.435 --> 13:38.718
Well, so many men had been wounded.

13:38.998 --> 13:43.003
I think we had 35 on the patrol, and 21 had been killed or wounded.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.285
That we could not even carry all the wounded back.

13:45.305 --> 13:47.107
I helped my wounded foxhole buddy back.

13:47.428 --> 13:51.933
It took two men to carry the company exec back, who had both legs riddled.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.756
The company commander, I mean the squad commander,

13:54.736 --> 13:58.386
The platoon commander, the second lieutenant, had been killed.

13:58.406 --> 14:05.085
I think the guy that kicked the thing off in front of me had had both of his legs blown off.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.452
That was not, some of them were Bouncing Betty's, but that was not.

14:07.492 --> 14:09.758
It was Bouncing Betty, by the way.

14:09.738 --> 14:10.819
It's like a fireworks.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.584
It explodes, it throws it up in the air about this high, and then it explodes.

14:14.884 --> 14:18.088
And it's much more dangerous up here than on the ground.

14:18.388 --> 14:20.370
But the one that I saw was not a bedding.

14:20.390 --> 14:26.377
So anyway, we got back, and maybe there were 14 or 15 survivors.

14:26.878 --> 14:28.500
Not all were dead by any means.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.983
Actually, mostly were wounded, some dead.

14:31.003 --> 14:36.589
But out of 35 men, about, maybe 36, there were only about 14 of us left.

14:36.839 --> 14:42.390
Two other guys crawled in my hole that night, and both of them had lost their foxhole buddy.

14:43.111 --> 14:48.321
One of them lay in the bottom of the hole and cried that he couldn't take it anymore, and he deserted the next day.

14:48.401 --> 14:50.325
We didn't know when he took off.

14:50.345 --> 14:53.832
The other one, who became my next foxhole buddy, just lay in the bottom and slept.

14:54.193 --> 14:58.020
He was so tired, and I stood guard all night.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.625
And you had to be beyond exhausted.

15:00.705 --> 15:00.925
Right.

15:00.945 --> 15:06.756
Well, the next morning, they decided to take us back into Edelbrook, which was just a mile or two away for a little rest.

15:06.776 --> 15:08.479
And I got sort of tickled by this.

15:08.499 --> 15:09.461
A lieutenant met us.

15:09.481 --> 15:12.787
And all of a sudden, he said, well, where's the rest of the platoon?

15:12.807 --> 15:16.414
And about three men spoke up at once, each one knowing what it was.

15:16.394 --> 15:18.617
what reaction they were going to get from the lieutenant.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.120
He said, this is the second platoon.

15:21.180 --> 15:27.748
And sure enough, we got a stunned look on the face of the lieutenant, which everyone enjoys.

15:27.768 --> 15:31.733
It's amazing, really, that infantrymen take a certain pride in survival.

15:32.474 --> 15:36.519
Because it's quite difficult to survive, it turns out.

15:36.539 --> 15:37.440
Indeed.

15:37.724 --> 15:45.895
Whenever I've talked to anybody who fought in or around the Battle of the Bulge, the first thing they always talk about is the weather, is about how cold it was.

15:45.915 --> 15:53.446
And most of them have a hard time really putting into words exactly how brutal the weather was.

15:53.466 --> 15:58.953
And I know that soon after this, you were on an offensive, I guess the southern flank of the Battle of the Bulge.

15:58.973 --> 15:59.234
That's right.

15:59.254 --> 16:01.276
We were caving in the southern flank of the Bulge.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.859
And in a blinding blizzard.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.580
A blinding blizzard.

16:03.600 --> 16:03.900
Right.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.194
It was so cold, it must have been zero at least.

16:07.616 --> 16:11.211
And the wind blowing 44 miles an hour and snow whipping around.

16:11.873 --> 16:14.464
And we headed off in the middle of that blinding blizzard

16:15.220 --> 16:19.645
walking in snow that was probably up to your knees, which exhausts you so much.

16:20.466 --> 16:22.127
But another interesting thing happened.

16:22.608 --> 16:27.994
You know, some of the great battles, if you study history, are won when you do what the enemy doesn't think you've done.

16:28.014 --> 16:31.017
Like MacArthur at Incheon, he landed where the tide was 30 feet.

16:31.578 --> 16:36.583
And he caught him totally by surprise in one of the greatest battles in US military history.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.625
Well, that night we won a small victory.

16:38.645 --> 16:40.387
It was small, but it was for the same reason.

16:40.968 --> 16:43.270
We had a patrol out on our left flank.

16:43.537 --> 16:50.067
And they literally fell in practically to a German machine gun position, but they were all asleep.

16:50.087 --> 16:55.696
And so on that blizzard, they were all down there sleeping, saying, these idiots aren't going to come out in this night.

16:56.217 --> 16:57.398
So we took a prison.

16:57.459 --> 16:59.942
We had a boy in the company that spoke fluent German.

16:59.962 --> 17:00.704
He was a German boy.

17:00.744 --> 17:06.152
And he got over there, and I don't know what he was telling them, but I guarantee you he wasn't paying any attention to the Geneva Convention.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.887
because those guys talked.

17:07.907 --> 17:08.809
They were not tortured.

17:08.929 --> 17:10.172
They were probably threatened, though.

17:10.994 --> 17:16.328
And they told him that the rest of the men, there was a woods over off the road, and they told him,

17:16.915 --> 17:18.837
that there would probably be a platoon in there.

17:18.857 --> 17:27.826
So we sent one or two of them in there to tell them that they had a whole bunch of Americans, hundreds of Americans surrounding that woods, and they better come out or it was going to be too bad.

17:27.846 --> 17:28.747
By golly, they did.

17:29.147 --> 17:31.850
So we had basically, it turns out they were retreating.

17:31.870 --> 17:33.271
They had fallen back a few miles.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.054
And they had left this rear guard.

17:36.074 --> 17:39.917
So we had basically wiped out their rear guard without firing a shot.

17:40.418 --> 17:43.581
And so we were able to head down this road towards the town of

17:43.561 --> 17:51.212
of Borscheid, which was our objective, and almost get there without seeing a single German in the snowstorm.

17:51.232 --> 17:56.540
In fact, at one time we saw some rocket launches, German rocket launches, firing back from where we came from.

17:56.620 --> 18:01.267
They were on another hill actually shooting towards our rear, where we had already left.

18:01.287 --> 18:07.476
But what happened was, just about dawn, all of a sudden, burp gun.

18:07.456 --> 18:11.700
By the way, you can tell from the speed of the firing whether it's American or German weapon.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.203
The German weapon's fired twice as fast as the American weapon.

18:15.223 --> 18:16.765
So burp, I know it's a burp gun.

18:17.185 --> 18:20.508
Some guy comes running back that we've run into a German patrol.

18:20.568 --> 18:23.791
So we just all dash forward as fast as we can.

18:24.412 --> 18:29.957
In G Company, we were in the front, I believe, and the first and third platoons immediately attack.

18:29.997 --> 18:32.399
Since we have so few men, we're bringing up the rear.

18:32.419 --> 18:33.501
And we head down this hill.

18:33.961 --> 18:36.163
It's a slope leading down to the town.

18:36.143 --> 18:53.038
in knee-deep snow moving as fast as we can been up all night walking and uh hadn't had much sleep before that and i'll admit i wasn't moving real fast yes sir and all of a sudden pop and somehow i kicked in my afterburners

18:53.660 --> 18:56.246
Nothing like a little bullet popping by your head.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.311
The next one may be in your head.

18:58.431 --> 19:00.315
To give you a burst of energy.

19:00.335 --> 19:03.402
And I started moving faster than I thought I had strength to move.

19:03.422 --> 19:04.364
So I moved down this hill.

19:04.425 --> 19:05.968
I passed a house on my left.

19:05.988 --> 19:08.775
And suddenly I realized there was just one guy with me.

19:08.795 --> 19:09.636
Yes, sir.

19:09.657 --> 19:10.318
And I stopped.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.002
I did a very stupid thing.

19:12.022 --> 19:13.123
Again, I'm still green.

19:13.884 --> 19:17.690
For maybe 15 or 20 seconds, I just stood there trying to figure out what to do.

19:17.770 --> 19:23.458
And all of a sudden, I realized that about one more second or two more seconds, and I'm going to go to the other place.

19:23.778 --> 19:24.780
Right.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.322
Because I am a target.

19:26.342 --> 19:29.286
Well, there was a little hedgerow, no more than five

19:30.093 --> 19:32.575
yards in front of me, so I just dashed down.

19:32.595 --> 19:34.417
That head rose about this tall.

19:34.597 --> 19:36.278
I dashed down and threw myself behind it.

19:36.879 --> 19:44.405
Just as I did, I saw two guys in the first wave entering the city, and it was still dark enough that I could see the flame coming out of their rifles.

19:44.626 --> 19:51.732
I still have that picture in my mind of those two guys pumped over, bumping those bullets out as they went into the city.

19:52.372 --> 19:59.138
Well, I looked around, and suddenly I realized that this guy who had been with me had not moved when I did, so he was still a target.

19:59.506 --> 20:07.149
And as I turned around to yell at him to get down where I was, and just as I did, he let out a grunt and fell and never moved.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.614
He must have been shot right through the heart.

20:08.634 --> 20:09.938
He was dead just like that.

20:10.508 --> 20:16.739
Well, I took another look at this house, and I realized that there was a place there that looked like a back porch.

20:17.521 --> 20:20.225
Funny looking place, but it had some other soldiers on it.

20:20.245 --> 20:21.888
I don't know why they weren't inside, but they were there.

20:22.209 --> 20:26.336
So I got up and dashed over there and discovered very quickly that it was not a back porch.

20:26.697 --> 20:30.323
It was just a little area that jutted out, and it was where they stored junk.

20:30.624 --> 20:31.826
Well, it didn't jut out.

20:31.846 --> 20:35.132
It was carved into the house like that, into the corner of the house.

20:35.112 --> 20:36.396
But there was just two walls.

20:36.416 --> 20:37.079
There was no door.

20:37.660 --> 20:41.674
So I immediately got behind a pile of junk like the other five or six guys were.

20:41.694 --> 20:44.623
And just as I did, a hail of bullets came in.

20:44.864 --> 20:46.088
It was a shower of bullets.

20:46.510 --> 20:47.232
In fact...

20:48.258 --> 20:52.585
Sawdust started dripping down on my head from the bullets whacking right above my head.

20:53.006 --> 20:58.515
And about that time, my new foxhole buddy, a guy named Pittus, I remember his name, the only one I remember well.

20:58.755 --> 20:59.877
John Pittus was his name.

21:00.138 --> 21:02.462
He was another college student.

21:02.482 --> 21:03.583
Maybe that's why I remember him.

21:03.603 --> 21:06.168
He was a young man that went to Ohio State.

21:07.069 --> 21:08.892
He yelled, do something, do something.

21:08.912 --> 21:09.674
I said, what's the matter?

21:09.694 --> 21:11.957
He said, they put two bullets through this table I'm under.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.181
So I've raised my head up.

21:14.161 --> 21:20.629
And I very quickly saw that there was a house over on the edge of town with some big windows, and they probably were firing out of those windows.

21:20.649 --> 21:24.153
So I just screamed at the top of my boys, fire at those windows.

21:24.173 --> 21:25.194
And most of the guys did.

21:25.234 --> 21:31.221
We just sent a hail of bullets into those windows, and the German fire stopped just like you'd cut off a faucet.

21:31.241 --> 21:33.624
All of a sudden, those guys had bullets popping over their heads.

21:34.325 --> 21:39.070
And I imagine when those bullets went inside that room and bounced off the wall, it was pretty scary.

21:39.811 --> 21:42.234
So I suspect they got out of there in a hurry.

21:42.254 --> 21:44.016
So anyway, we then ran around the

21:44.418 --> 21:48.003
to get into the front of the house, because you had to run around the corner to get in.

21:48.804 --> 21:57.656
I didn't see this, another guy told me, but I brought up the rear, and he told me that just as I went around the corner, a German machine gun riddled up the wall right behind me.

21:57.676 --> 22:00.520
But I was so hard running, turning the corner that I did not see this.

22:00.981 --> 22:04.145
So we got inside the house, and once inside the house, there was nothing to do.

22:04.225 --> 22:06.188
Obviously there was a machine gun out there.

22:06.208 --> 22:10.594
So I sat down against the wall and got my breakfast out and started eating my breakfast.

22:11.789 --> 22:19.284
Well, we hadn't been there very long when all of a sudden the tanks were supposed to support us, but they couldn't keep up because of the snow.

22:19.304 --> 22:19.725
Yes, sir.

22:19.745 --> 22:28.262
And one of them arrived on the opposite side of town, and apparently somebody was shooting out of the window of the house, and he saw that fire and thought we were German.

22:28.327 --> 22:32.312
So this American tank promptly slams a shell into the house we're in.

22:32.693 --> 22:34.595
Fortunately, it hit the other side of the house.

22:34.976 --> 22:40.243
Blew a hole about that big it's all because the walls were this thick and stone and brick.

22:40.563 --> 22:42.285
So they really were little forts.

22:42.305 --> 22:44.448
It took a cannon to blow the wall in, really.

22:44.468 --> 22:45.710
And it only blew a hole this big.

22:45.730 --> 22:50.436
But the poor old captain, he ran in yelling, somebody do something, somebody do something.

22:50.416 --> 22:54.682
But the guy had his radio operator with him, and so the radio operator got hold of the tank.

22:55.143 --> 22:57.847
We didn't get hit by any more shells, fortunately.

22:58.468 --> 23:04.437
But what was funny, though, this is an 18-year-old talking, so please forgive me, everyone.

23:04.778 --> 23:07.262
You've got to remember I was a smart, alecky 18-year-old.

23:07.282 --> 23:07.923
Yes, sir.

23:07.943 --> 23:09.305
This other soldier looked at me.

23:09.345 --> 23:11.348
I was just sat through all of this, shell and everything.

23:11.388 --> 23:12.570
I was eating my breakfast.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.272
I just never even bothered.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.033
And this guy looked at me.

23:15.254 --> 23:18.178
How can you eat at a time like this?

23:18.378 --> 23:20.160
Might as well die with a full stomach, I said.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.063
You were a smart aleck.

23:22.083 --> 23:24.105
No, not a bit.

23:24.425 --> 23:26.588
Totally for effect, of course.

23:26.928 --> 23:28.711
Just my little way of bragging.

23:28.731 --> 23:37.521
There is a lot to Dick Davison's story, as you can imagine, and that's why we're going to continue with Dick Davison next week.

23:37.542 --> 23:45.631
We've just got a few minutes left on this show because there are facets to his service that you're really going to want to hear about.

23:46.092 --> 23:46.933
I want to...

23:46.913 --> 23:53.179
In next week's show, we're going to be talking about after the war was over, you had gone to the hospital.

23:53.219 --> 23:57.102
We're going to talk about how you nearly lost your feet because of the cold.

23:57.542 --> 24:01.906
But eventually, you actually were at Nuremberg.

24:02.066 --> 24:02.607
Yeah, I was.

24:02.747 --> 24:09.993
And there's a photograph that you've supplied to us, I think, at that time when you were at Nuremberg that I want to show the folks right now.

24:10.514 --> 24:12.195
And you can sort of tell us about that.

24:12.275 --> 24:13.336
We'll show it again next week.

24:13.396 --> 24:14.718
There it is right there on the screen.

24:15.058 --> 24:16.279
Talk about what we're looking at there.

24:16.462 --> 24:17.784
You're on the left, by the way.

24:17.944 --> 24:19.627
Yeah, I'm the guy over here on the left.

24:19.647 --> 24:22.130
And one of my jobs, well, I had three jobs, basically.

24:22.231 --> 24:24.654
One of them was to clean the bathrooms, of which there were 30.

24:25.035 --> 24:27.739
The other one was to police the grounds, picking up all the paper.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.802
And the third was to take the trash to the dump.

24:29.822 --> 24:31.164
And this is the third.

24:31.184 --> 24:32.987
And that guy, you can see, he's a PW.

24:33.007 --> 24:34.028
He's an SS trooper.

24:34.549 --> 24:36.852
And we went out every morning and collected these guys.

24:36.912 --> 24:38.074
And they did the actual labor.

24:38.094 --> 24:38.976
We just guarded them.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.980
So here I am with a couple of my comrades and

24:42.466 --> 24:48.934
We posed for this picture while the prisoner of war that you can see in the background was shoveling the paper out of the back of the truck.

24:49.254 --> 24:54.421
An interesting thing about this, by the way, was a lot of this trash was coming down from the war crime trials.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.785
And so on the way out, I got to read what was going on up in the courthouse.

24:57.825 --> 24:59.527
And it was very fascinating, really.

24:59.627 --> 25:01.930
Right, because you were actually living at the courthouse.

25:01.950 --> 25:05.694
I was living in the courthouse when they were trying Gary and all those other big shots.

25:05.734 --> 25:06.195
You bet.

25:06.783 --> 25:08.545
That's a fascinating part of history.

25:08.565 --> 25:10.148
I've got another picture, I believe.

25:10.168 --> 25:13.993
This is after your service, just to see what young Dick Davison looked like.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.555
I'm about 23 here, by the way.

25:15.635 --> 25:16.757
About 23 years old.

25:16.817 --> 25:21.063
So this was about the time, I don't think we mentioned that you, after the war, you came back.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.084
You went to Texas Tech.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.106
That's where you graduated.

25:23.126 --> 25:26.110
So this is about, you looked like about a college senior.

25:26.130 --> 25:27.191
About the time I graduated.

25:27.211 --> 25:30.957
Yeah, that might have been a graduation picture, for all I know, but it was about that time.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.939
Yeah.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.782
Sharp-looking young man there.

25:34.762 --> 25:36.124
Indeed.

25:36.144 --> 25:38.547
Again, we're going to continue this next week.

25:38.627 --> 25:46.218
But Dick, you have talked so much about being under fire in World War II and being kind of a cool customer during all of this.

25:47.019 --> 25:49.362
What were your thoughts back then?

25:49.402 --> 25:58.035
You must have thought as you saw these soldiers dying around you that any time could be your time.

25:58.055 --> 26:00.318
What do you recall were your thoughts back then?

26:00.358 --> 26:03.402
Because you were still a young man, hopefully with a long life to live.

26:04.023 --> 26:09.875
Actually, it turns out that I would probably be more afraid now when I'm in my old age and sick and probably don't have many years left.

26:09.895 --> 26:13.743
I think I'd be more afraid now than I was then because I'm so much smarter now.

26:14.504 --> 26:18.052
That's why I think they fight wars with young men for two reasons.

26:18.072 --> 26:20.376
One, they are foolhardy.

26:20.396 --> 26:25.086
And two, they're physically fit and strong and they have fast reflexes.

26:25.066 --> 26:27.972
And so they can actually duck and move and so forth.

26:27.992 --> 26:30.778
But you know, of course I knew I could be killed.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.742
And you play games with yourself.

26:32.762 --> 26:37.712
My own game was to... I have a mathematical mind, so I'd look at it statistically.

26:38.253 --> 26:40.678
And I would say, well, this will probably not be the day.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.941
It may come, but it won't be today.

26:43.961 --> 26:45.903
There's a good chance it will not be today.

26:46.184 --> 26:49.728
And sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

26:49.928 --> 26:51.610
Those days continued that they were today.

26:51.630 --> 26:53.092
And we're going to talk more about it next week.

26:53.492 --> 26:54.493
Thanks for visiting with us.

26:55.194 --> 27:01.722
Dick Davison's story of service in World War II's European theater is one of those that can't be told in just 30 minutes.

27:01.742 --> 27:03.083
So it will continue next week.

27:03.504 --> 27:08.910
He'll talk about those foxhole buddies that he lost, his own close calls, his life after World War II,

27:08.890 --> 27:11.035
and about Operation Keelhaul.

27:11.055 --> 27:12.578
That's a story tough to tell.

27:13.239 --> 27:16.947
We thank Dick Davison for his service, and we thank all veterans.

27:17.629 --> 27:19.072
Please join us next week.

27:19.132 --> 27:20.114
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:20.194 --> 27:22.900

27:35.266 --> 27:53.376
