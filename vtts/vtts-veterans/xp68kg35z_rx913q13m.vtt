00:30.317 --> 00:32.534
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.774 --> 00:33.936
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.540 --> 00:37.683
It was six years of life that he'll never get back.

00:37.703 --> 00:49.333
But Lieutenant Colonel Al Meyer will never forget that time from the spring of 1967 to the spring of 73 that he spent as a captive of the North Vietnamese Army, a POW.

00:49.353 --> 00:52.616
Sitting in the back seat of his F-105, he was shot out of the sky.

00:52.676 --> 00:54.038
His pilot did not make it.

00:54.718 --> 01:03.366
Today, Al Meyer, A&M class of 1960, and his wife, Bobby, live in rural Brazos County, where most of his reminders are indeed in his memory.

01:04.105 --> 01:14.846
For Bobby Meyer, the memory is that of waiting with two young boys, not knowing for two and a half years that her missing in action husband was indeed alive and a prisoner.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.494
It's a story as compelling as you've heard yet on Veterans of the Valley.

01:18.834 --> 01:20.157
Al Meyer, it's an honor to have you.

01:20.491 --> 01:21.172
here today.

01:21.492 --> 01:27.539
We need to fast forward through a lot of your story because we want to get to the story of your imprisonment in Vietnam.

01:27.559 --> 01:32.846
But I know that you were Aggie class of 1960 and you joined the Air Force.

01:32.866 --> 01:33.587
Why the Air Force?

01:33.627 --> 01:36.831
And talk about your job and what you were trained for.

01:36.851 --> 01:37.331
Oh, okay.

01:37.992 --> 01:48.945
Well, I joined the Air Force because I had a teacher in high school that said he was in the Air Force or at that time Army Air Corps in World War II and he flew B-29s, said he was

01:49.178 --> 01:57.029
in the middle of the battle every day, but he had a nice clean warm bed to sleep in at night, so I figured the Air Force was for me.

01:58.151 --> 02:01.916
Little did you know what was coming up, but talk about your job and your training.

02:01.936 --> 02:10.529
I know you went to El Paso, from El Paso where it was hot, to Duluth, Minnesota where it was 30 below, but during this time you were trained as an electronic warfare officer.

02:10.609 --> 02:12.992
Talk about what that job was and what it entailed.

02:13.428 --> 02:27.844
Well, electronic warfare officer, most of us, went to B-52s and sat in the back of the B-52 and operated the electronic defenses for the B-52, the jammers and things like that to jam the enemy radar.

02:28.825 --> 02:30.888
And that's what most of our class went to.

02:31.388 --> 02:37.495
I went to Air Defense Command and flew in B-57s, which was a light bomber.

02:37.475 --> 02:46.314
and our job was to fly targets for the Nike Air Defense missile training and then also for fighter interceptor pilot training.

02:46.334 --> 02:51.284
We would jam their radars while they tried to intercept us and simulate shooting us down.

02:51.304 --> 02:55.433
Yeah, you got orders to go to Thailand and you got your exact training for...

02:55.413 --> 02:59.618
for combat and what you were gonna do in Las Vegas.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.460
And that was kind of a fast track, I understand.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.843
They put about five or six months worth of training into about three weeks, is that right?

03:04.863 --> 03:06.265
In three weeks, yes.

03:06.285 --> 03:07.686
And that was in Las Vegas, right?

03:07.706 --> 03:08.527
Right.

03:08.547 --> 03:10.930
The first morning, we had a little bit of academics.

03:10.950 --> 03:14.474
They showed us how the ejection seat in the 105 worked.

03:14.494 --> 03:18.138
And they showed us how the equipment that we were going to be working with worked.

03:18.158 --> 03:22.062
And then we got in the airplane and we flew 13 missions.

03:22.649 --> 03:25.173
We went out to the gunnery range and fired the guns.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.134
We dropped bombs.

03:26.154 --> 03:29.599
And then we worked against the SAC RBS sites.

03:29.619 --> 03:34.686
They had the SA-2 simulators, the Soviet missiles, the SA-2.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.129
And they had the radar simulators.

03:37.229 --> 03:39.593
We had the equipment to home in on this radar.

03:40.234 --> 03:44.039
So we practiced against the RBS sites at St.

03:44.059 --> 03:47.003
George, Utah, and Hawthorne, Nevada.

03:47.337 --> 03:54.146
You were stationed in Thailand, and then in January, late January of 1967, that's when you arrived in Thailand.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.147
Talk about your first flight.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.872
You actually were on your first flight before you were even officially there.

03:58.892 --> 04:00.575
Yes, before I had signed in.

04:00.595 --> 04:07.264
Well, I arrived late one afternoon and went to personnel, and they told me to come back the next morning at 9 o'clock.

04:07.484 --> 04:13.632
So I went back down to the squadron, and they had us on a flying schedule.

04:14.168 --> 04:14.869
We went flying.

04:14.889 --> 04:18.875
We got up at 2 o'clock that morning and we had a 4 o'clock in the morning takeoff.

04:19.957 --> 04:21.018
And it was pitch black.

04:21.439 --> 04:28.229
We took off and the air conditioning system on the F-105 doesn't come on until the gears retracted.

04:28.950 --> 04:36.842
And when we got off the runway and retracted the gear, there was a large rice bug came out of the air conditioning in the front cockpit.

04:36.862 --> 04:39.446
And the pilot says, you got it.

04:39.486 --> 04:40.648
And so I had to stick and

04:41.354 --> 04:43.476
You know, it was pitch black out there.

04:43.497 --> 04:47.681
There were no visual references and they had taken most of our flight instruments out of the back seat.

04:48.482 --> 05:00.256
And so I was trying to maintain wings level and positive rate of climb and not stall the airplane until he got through with the rice bug and every once in a while he'd swat the stick and the airplane would wobble a little bit.

05:00.597 --> 05:04.001
He finally killed the rice bug and so we went on with the mission.

05:04.021 --> 05:04.761
And you were sure glad.

05:04.781 --> 05:07.124
That was your first enemy in Vietnam was a rice bug, right?

05:07.144 --> 05:07.485
Right.

05:07.505 --> 05:08.826
Yeah, but you were able to defeat it.

05:10.228 --> 05:10.348
Right.

05:10.868 --> 05:11.950
Mission number 35.

05:12.611 --> 05:15.655
Talk about mission number 35 and how that certainly changed your life.

05:16.256 --> 05:22.966
Well, mission number 35, we were scheduled to fly, but we had the lowest priority for getting an airplane.

05:23.006 --> 05:27.433
If they had four F models that were going to be in commission, then we were going to go on a mission.

05:28.394 --> 05:33.722
And we thought it so highly impossible that we didn't even order lunch when all the other people ordered lunch.

05:33.862 --> 05:37.087
And we were going to go eat after it was all over with.

05:37.107 --> 05:37.247
Mm-hmm.

05:37.227 --> 05:46.036
But anyway, they put us on a flying schedule, and they had four EFSA in commission, and so here we went off to North Vietnam.

05:46.136 --> 05:58.828
The target that day was an electrical switching station, which was in a building inside a dirt revetment, which we had tried to bomb two or three times before, never had been able to hit that building.

05:59.709 --> 06:05.935
And so we got to the beginning of what we call Thud Ridge, which was a ridge which sort of

06:06.623 --> 06:16.977
point it toward Hanoi like a finger, and you could fly down that ridge, and if they fired a missile at you from one side, then you could dodge to the other side to get away from the missile.

06:18.038 --> 06:31.977
But when we got there, it was very cloudy, and we were four minutes ahead of the mission lead, the mission commander, and we called back to him and told him that it was all cloudy, and he said, well, go take a look.

06:31.997 --> 06:33.559
There may be a hole over Hanoi.

06:34.298 --> 06:41.568
I remember that, and I remember we were above the clouds, and the missile popped out of the cloud and exploded right above the airplane.

06:41.849 --> 06:43.992
And that's pretty much where your memory ends right then.

06:44.012 --> 06:44.693
That ends right there.

06:45.394 --> 06:47.917
Until you woke up.

06:47.937 --> 06:49.199
In a bamboo hut.

06:49.219 --> 06:49.740
In a bamboo hut.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.425
Now, somewhere in there, you don't remember it, but obviously both you and the pilot were able to eject.

06:54.126 --> 06:58.552
The pilot, as you said, eventually did not make it, but you did.

06:58.572 --> 07:02.938
And your next memory, in a bamboo hut, and you woke up, opened your eyes, and what did you see?

07:03.509 --> 07:11.861
Well, I saw a whole bunch of very vicious Vietnamese, and they were asking me if I was Russian.

07:12.843 --> 07:14.385
And of course, I told them I was American.

07:14.425 --> 07:16.308
I probably should have told them I was Russian.

07:17.249 --> 07:19.533
But anyway, they became very vicious.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.294
They spit on me.

07:20.334 --> 07:21.616
They twisted my broken leg.

07:21.636 --> 07:22.477
I had a broken leg.

07:22.557 --> 07:28.386
I had cuts and burns and bruises all over my body, and they had stripped all my clothes off, which

07:28.906 --> 07:42.181
That was probably a good thing that I was unconscious when they did that because some of the guys that were conscious when they took their clothes off, you know, the snaps and buckles and zippers and so on really baffled them.

07:42.201 --> 07:44.283
So they just took their clothes off with a machete.

07:44.303 --> 07:47.627
So they say it was quite a scary experience.

07:47.647 --> 07:48.268
I'll bet it was.

07:48.588 --> 07:56.837
And the North Vietnamese Army then showed up and they put you on a jeep and sort of paraded you around a little bit, right?

07:57.357 --> 08:16.255
Well, yeah, it was the trip to Hanoi, but every time we went through a village, they would stop in the village and they would roll up the side curtains on the truck and let the villagers come look at me and they would hit me with their hands and fists and twist my broken leg and things like that.

08:16.475 --> 08:23.382
And probably the most vicious of these people were the ones that had the red

08:23.733 --> 08:25.995
lips and teeth from chewing betel nuts.

08:26.015 --> 08:26.575
The women.

08:26.595 --> 08:28.357
Those women were very vicious people.

08:29.138 --> 08:36.223
And, you know, they were really mean, you know, as far as hitting and spitting and twisting my broken leg and so on.

08:36.243 --> 08:36.524
Wow.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.127
I just can't imagine.

08:40.347 --> 08:42.188
We did this in every village that we stopped.

08:42.208 --> 08:53.638
Sometimes the crowd would get out of control and the guard that was in the back of the truck with me would jab him with the bayonet or hit him over the head with his rifle to get him to back up or threaten to shoot him.

08:54.513 --> 08:58.797
And, you know, they finally get him backed up and because he was fearing for his own life.

09:00.139 --> 09:06.425
Talk about the interrogations that you went through really throughout and what the interrogations involved.

09:06.445 --> 09:13.852
I know I think the first person that interrogated you was actually a Swedish doctor who you remember is looking like Bob Barker from The Price is Right.

09:14.172 --> 09:14.453
Right.

09:15.534 --> 09:16.134
Talk about that.

09:16.495 --> 09:17.316
Yes.

09:18.116 --> 09:21.820
The day after I was shot down, they stopped in a town somewhere.

09:22.306 --> 09:30.496
at a hospital and there was a doctor there that spoke very good English and he looked like Bob Barker and I was later told he was Swedish.

09:31.136 --> 09:51.300
He was a personal friend of Ho Chi Minh and he told me that he had connections to the International Red Cross and he could get a letter out for me and of course at that time I didn't think I was going to live anyway so I really wasn't that interested in getting a letter out and then he wanted to talk about things like what kind of an airplane did I fly and I wouldn't tell him and he got mad at me and

09:52.310 --> 09:57.100
I don't know, I guess he was the one that supervised putting a cast on my leg, but they put a cast on my leg.

09:58.002 --> 10:09.205
And then when I came to again, they put me on that truck again, and we started back toward Hanoi, and we stopped at all the villages, same routine as the day before.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.444
And even at night, those people don't sleep at night.

10:12.464 --> 10:13.726
There's always somebody awake.

10:13.746 --> 10:18.593
And when they pulled into a village, there were always people awake, even in the middle of the night.

10:18.874 --> 10:25.144
When you got to Hanoi, you were placed in what is very commonly known as the Hanoi Hilton prison.

10:25.164 --> 10:28.729
Talk about that, what kind of experience that was initially.

10:29.190 --> 10:32.976
And the interrogation that went on there was different.

10:32.996 --> 10:36.181
It was a little bit different, a little bit more intense, right?

10:36.201 --> 10:37.082
Right, it was.

10:37.805 --> 10:41.889
When I got there, they'd try to do things to me, and I'd pass out.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.872
You can't torture someone that's unconscious.

10:45.472 --> 10:50.397
So they kept telling me that if I didn't talk to them, I wouldn't get any medical care, and then I was going to die.

10:51.298 --> 10:57.323
So I held out for a while, and then I figured, well, I don't have anything to lose but my life, and so I'll talk to them.

10:57.383 --> 11:02.288
And I started to tell them that first question was what kind of an airplane was in.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.871
I told them 105, and then the next question was D model or F model.

11:06.172 --> 11:08.755
The D model being the single seat and the F model being the two seat.

11:09.396 --> 11:18.066
And I told him a D model because I had decided I was going to tell him I was an F-105 pilot rather than an EWO because I figured they'd have fewer questions for a pilot than they would an EWO.

11:19.347 --> 11:28.618
And so he immediately told me that I was lying to him because he knew that I was from an F-105F and that I was an EWO and he had just talked to my pilot, Major Dudash.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.574
So they knew the answers pretty much to the questions before they asked.

11:32.594 --> 11:35.679
They just wanted to know how trustworthy you were going to be with your answers, right?

11:35.699 --> 11:36.280
Right.

11:36.300 --> 11:41.668
And of course, then they went and they really didn't want a whole lot of intelligence.

11:41.748 --> 11:44.932
The big question was, what were the next targets?

11:44.953 --> 11:47.316
And that was something that we didn't even know because

11:47.971 --> 11:57.310
We would always receive the targets the night before we actually went to bomb these targets because they would come in from Washington, and we would receive a number.

11:57.411 --> 12:08.173
Each target in North Vietnam had a Joint Chiefs of Staff number, a JCS number, and we would get the number of which target we were supposed to bomb the next day.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.352
So we didn't know ahead of time what they were going to be.

12:12.372 --> 12:14.095
And so, you know, they kept pressing.

12:14.135 --> 12:15.737
I finally, you know, I made up some.

12:15.837 --> 12:20.785
And I told him Phukien Airfield and the Dumer Bridge, which were always off-limits for us.

12:20.825 --> 12:23.429
We flew over them every day, but they wouldn't let us bomb those things.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.854
And the docks in Haiphong.

12:26.874 --> 12:32.322
And then he stopped me and he says, the docks in Haiphong are in Route Pack 6 Bravo.

12:32.342 --> 12:34.205
And he says, that's Navy operational area.

12:34.565 --> 12:37.249
So he knew it was the Navy's area, not the Air Force.

12:37.735 --> 12:40.920
You went to what they called a Heartbreak Hotel.

12:41.120 --> 12:51.235
There was also another portion of that that you all called Little Las Vegas because the different areas were named after clubs, like you were in, I think, the one called Golden Nugget, right?

12:51.696 --> 12:53.218
Is that right?

12:53.559 --> 13:05.717
Well, Heartbreak Hotel was, you would go to the interrogation room, you stayed there until they finished interrogating you, and then they would take you to what they called Heartbreak Hotel, and it was a real heartbreaker because

13:06.490 --> 13:10.556
Here you finally came to the realization of what had happened to you and so on.

13:11.278 --> 13:15.003
And I stayed there, I don't remember how long, three or four days.

13:15.885 --> 13:22.996
And I was lying on the floor since I was in a body cast from my chest all the way down to the bottom of my foot.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.438
You spent how long on your back?

13:24.478 --> 13:26.642
You were shot down in April until August, is that right?

13:26.662 --> 13:28.966
I was flat on my back for three months.

13:29.046 --> 13:29.707
For three months.

13:30.127 --> 13:32.151
And I didn't get a bath during that time.

13:32.852 --> 13:33.713
Smelled pretty ripe.

13:33.929 --> 13:37.394
Lieutenant Colonel Meyer has some photographs.

13:37.434 --> 13:51.256
Some of them are from a sketchbook that was sketched by one of the fellow POWs, and we'd like to go to some of the pictures, some of the pictures that were taken of him and some from this sketchbook so you can get somewhat of an idea of what he's talking about in this POW camp.

13:51.276 --> 13:55.602
You can see right there on the monitor, Lieutenant Colonel Meyer, some of the pictures that you have brought.

13:56.063 --> 13:56.644
Talk about them.

13:56.664 --> 13:58.106
There's the F-105, right?

13:58.487 --> 14:01.371
Yes, the F-105 F-bottle in the

14:01.773 --> 14:05.437
The one in the background there is the D model, the single seat 105.

14:06.778 --> 14:16.448
We usually flew at least two F models in a flight and then two other F models or two other D models, depending on what we had available to fly that day.

14:16.469 --> 14:16.809
All right.

14:16.969 --> 14:21.334
Next picture, I think we'll move on to it.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.175
There's a close-up.

14:22.815 --> 14:24.577
That was our personal airplane.

14:24.637 --> 14:25.578
It had our pictures on it.

14:25.598 --> 14:29.282
I don't know if you can read that, but the rear canopy had my name on it.

14:31.523 --> 14:33.105
as quite a craft.

14:33.846 --> 14:39.072
This is obviously a sky shot of the imprisonment, or Hanoi.

14:39.092 --> 14:39.833
You talk about that.

14:39.873 --> 14:41.395
What are we looking at?

14:41.415 --> 14:43.057
Okay, that's downtown Hanoi.

14:43.097 --> 14:52.488
This was taken by a drone aircraft, pilotless aircraft, took these pictures in December of 1972.

14:52.608 --> 14:59.657
And the building there, the large building with the white roof, that's the Ministry of Justice.

14:59.637 --> 15:03.202
And then just to the right of that is the Wallow Prison.

15:03.222 --> 15:09.011
And the prison had the 20-foot high walls around it with glass on top of it.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.996
And it had about a 30-foot no man's land.

15:12.016 --> 15:18.085
And then all the cells open to the inside of that compound.

15:18.368 --> 15:25.102
And from right here, I can't see well enough to, okay, there's a... Okay, that's a close-up of actual Hanoi Hilton.

15:25.342 --> 15:25.523
Yeah.

15:26.064 --> 15:30.994
If at the bottom of the picture is the large portion, which is where we all ended up

15:31.717 --> 15:40.725
Later on, after they had a raid at Sante and they brought us all together in one camp, we were in that large portion in the back.

15:40.745 --> 15:45.730
But that upper left portion up there, that was what they called a Little Vegas.

15:45.770 --> 15:50.314
And the reason they called it Little Vegas, most of the guys there were 105 pilots and they trained in Las Vegas.

15:50.514 --> 15:50.855
I see.

15:51.295 --> 16:00.103
And then just that roof line that goes through the middle of it there, that's where the Heartbreak Hotel was.

16:00.623 --> 16:09.077
and in that large compound in the upper right-hand corner there is where they had the interrogation rooms, which they called New Guy Village.

16:09.699 --> 16:11.962
Okay, let's move on with the next picture.

16:12.203 --> 16:13.926
Now, these are from the sketchbook.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.350
Who was the artist?

16:16.470 --> 16:18.674
The person that did that name was Mike McGrath.

16:18.714 --> 16:23.442
He was one of my cellmates, and he was a very talented artist.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.219
So you got an idea of what we're talking about?

16:25.239 --> 16:27.181
That's Heartbreak Hotel.

16:27.221 --> 16:31.165
They had concrete bunks, and they had those stocks at the foot of the bunk.

16:31.185 --> 16:32.966
They would put people's feet in there.

16:33.407 --> 16:36.510
Sometimes they'd put one foot in one side, and they'd put two wrists in the other one.

16:36.850 --> 16:37.190
Oh, wow.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.953
Sometimes they'd put the two feet in and put a handcuff on one arm.

16:40.073 --> 16:41.714
They could actually lock it from the outside.

16:41.774 --> 16:46.739
You see there to the right, they just push that bar in from the outside, and that would lock it.

16:46.819 --> 16:48.120
Okay, next photo.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.261
Let's go to that one.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.302
Now, this is interesting.

16:50.322 --> 16:52.264
This is your communication code here.

16:52.244 --> 17:16.817
Right they kept us isolated from each othe. They didn't even allow us to see each other or talk to each other and communicating or talking to someone in the next cell was, if you got caught doing that would would get you a severe beating, and we but we had a tap code we'd tap on the walls or sometimes take us out to work sweeping leaves or tamping dirt

17:17.388 --> 17:22.494
which made a lot of noise, and you could do that to the five-by-five rhythm and send messages.

17:22.515 --> 17:24.797
And so we sent messages all over the camp that way.

17:25.238 --> 17:37.554
The way it worked was you take the alphabet and you eliminate the K, and in place of a K, you use a C. And the first set of taps is to roll across the second set.

17:37.574 --> 17:38.254
Roll across the top?

17:38.595 --> 17:39.196
Right.

17:39.216 --> 17:46.585
Okay, so if you wanted to say hi to somebody, you'd hit, you'd go three times and then two times, that would be an H, and then you'd go four times and two times, and that would be an I.

17:47.392 --> 17:48.893
Did I get that right?

17:49.374 --> 17:50.936
I could have done that.

17:52.757 --> 17:54.559
Some people were very proficient at that.

17:54.639 --> 17:59.324
They could rattle that stuff off the wall like nobody's business after doing that for years.

17:59.644 --> 18:01.606
Let's go on to the next picture there.

18:01.626 --> 18:02.627
Here's another sketch.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.049
What are we looking at there real quick?

18:04.129 --> 18:06.251
That's just one of our bunk.

18:07.452 --> 18:08.333
That's where we slept.

18:08.573 --> 18:09.774
We slept on boards.

18:09.834 --> 18:14.479
We had a little rice straw mat that we slept on, and we had two blankets, which

18:14.864 --> 18:21.592
Hanoi is in a tropical area, but it did get cold there in the winter and two blankets were really not too much.

18:22.573 --> 18:24.075
It was quite cold.

18:24.095 --> 18:25.676
And of course the summers were very hot.

18:27.679 --> 18:38.551
And this is another way that we communicated was by rolling up a blanket like a donut and then putting your face inside the blanket up against the wall and it muffled your voice so you couldn't be heard outside.

18:38.611 --> 18:41.074
And if you talked in a high squeaky voice,

18:41.425 --> 18:45.349
it would carry better through the wall than if you talked in a deep voice.

18:45.369 --> 18:48.632
And so, you know, guy on the other side was listening with his cup.

18:49.313 --> 18:50.434
Okay, let's go on.

18:53.437 --> 18:54.978
And that's after we were released.

18:55.639 --> 19:00.583
That's me and another Aggie, John Blevins from class of 1961.

19:01.825 --> 19:03.826
This was taken in Hawaii.

19:03.887 --> 19:10.673
We were on a 141 being taken from the Philippines to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.

19:11.277 --> 19:19.192
And they stopped in Hawaii to refuel for two hours, and they let us off the airplane, and they had all kinds of things for us and base operations.

19:19.352 --> 19:20.614
I'll bet they did.

19:20.634 --> 19:21.336
It's a great picture.

19:22.097 --> 19:22.598
Here you are.

19:23.379 --> 19:28.128
That's the 141 flight from Hanoi to Philippines.

19:28.148 --> 19:33.538
That's me getting off the airplane, and the Admiral there to the right is Admiral Naylor.

19:34.092 --> 19:37.435
who at the time was commander of Pacific forces.

19:37.455 --> 19:38.957
And he was welcoming you back home.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.198
Boy, what a memorable moment.

19:40.258 --> 19:46.645
I'm one of the people that's old enough to remember these things being broadcast on television when the POWs came home.

19:47.185 --> 19:47.586
Amazing.

19:47.706 --> 19:49.248
Let's go on to the next one.

19:50.048 --> 19:54.533
We're going to talk a little bit later about a time that you were caught smarting off during an interrogation.

19:54.573 --> 19:57.756
And you had to sort of go through this exercise for a couple of days, right?

19:57.836 --> 19:57.957
Right.

19:57.977 --> 19:59.819
They did that to me for two days.

20:00.259 --> 20:01.020
Out in the hot sun.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.222
When I passed out, they would beat me until I

20:03.522 --> 20:04.203
got back up.

20:05.685 --> 20:08.529
So I went through that for two days.

20:08.549 --> 20:09.470
Okay, let's move on.

20:09.610 --> 20:13.435
We've got going back into the prison camp again.

20:13.475 --> 20:13.916
What's that first?

20:13.936 --> 20:27.133
Inside the cells, when one guy would tap on the walls and however other many people were in the cells, they would look underneath the doors or out the windows or vent holes or whatever, watching for guards.

20:27.738 --> 20:29.921
And their signal for danger was one cough.

20:30.783 --> 20:33.026
And then two coughs was all clear.

20:33.046 --> 20:35.730
So that's how we watched.

20:36.371 --> 20:37.333
I like that picture.

20:37.353 --> 20:43.422
When we landed in Hawaii to refuel, these women were some friends of my wife.

20:43.923 --> 20:48.510
Their husbands had been stationed here at A&M, and they had made friends with my wife.

20:49.431 --> 20:51.935
But that's a great sign for you to see.

20:51.955 --> 20:52.156
Yeah.

20:52.576 --> 20:53.117
Absolutely.

20:53.398 --> 20:53.678
Wow.

20:53.898 --> 20:54.199
Okay.

20:54.219 --> 20:54.319
Okay.

20:54.974 --> 20:58.720
That's color guard at Kelly Air Force Base.

20:59.821 --> 21:05.450
When we arrived at Kelly Air Force Base, they sent us to the nearest large hospital to our home.

21:05.470 --> 21:06.011
Where you lived.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.396
And there's another picture of it from another angle.

21:13.502 --> 21:17.328
And that picture says all that it needs to say.

21:17.348 --> 21:20.874
What do you remember what you were thinking when that picture was taken of you and Bobby?

21:21.615 --> 21:22.176
Oh, I don't know.

21:22.376 --> 21:23.698
I was very happy about it.

21:24.033 --> 21:24.874
Pretty overwhelming.

21:25.035 --> 21:25.255
Yes.

21:25.515 --> 21:26.176
For both of you.

21:26.377 --> 21:26.937
Yes, it was.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.640
Wow.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.141
Incredible.

21:29.241 --> 21:29.622
Incredible.

21:31.384 --> 21:38.135
When you were at the Hanoi Hilton, your senior ranking officer, American senior ranking officer, very interesting, was Admiral James Stockdale.

21:39.216 --> 21:39.897
In the Little Vegas.

21:39.917 --> 21:40.398
In the Little Vegas.

21:40.418 --> 21:41.620
The very first one, yes.

21:41.640 --> 21:46.828
People might remember Admiral Stockdale as the running mate of Ross Perot.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.692
Admiral Stockdale just passed away this past summer.

21:50.073 --> 21:52.757
But how do you remember Admiral Stockdale?

21:53.699 --> 21:57.144
Well, I just remember the policies that he had sent out.

21:57.164 --> 22:02.151
You know, don't give them anything without torture and no escaping unless you have outside help.

22:02.251 --> 22:05.095
And he had a few other policies.

22:05.115 --> 22:11.044
I don't remember what all of them were, but they were passed on to us, and we were only there for about a week, and then we left.

22:11.624 --> 22:23.301
But his wife was the one that organized all the wives, which they had, the League of Families, and they were the ones that sold the POW bracelets to raise money for the campaign and so on.

22:23.872 --> 22:29.562
And that probably helped a whole lot with our treatment getting better in 1969.

22:30.487 --> 22:32.610
We need to fast forward a little bit.

22:32.630 --> 22:34.634
Let's fast forward to that.

22:34.654 --> 22:39.702
I know you got to the point to where you were able to actually intermingle with other POWs later on.

22:39.822 --> 22:46.212
That was obviously a significant change from the isolationism to actually being able to talk to other POWs.

22:46.232 --> 22:50.118
And the treatment did get better in September of 1969.

22:50.418 --> 22:51.019
The food better.

22:51.039 --> 22:52.862
You got some air vents.

22:54.044 --> 22:56.528
Sort of talk about that change and what you all thought that was all about.

22:56.930 --> 22:58.792
Well, we didn't really know what it was all about.

22:59.232 --> 23:03.817
We thought maybe we're going home soon or something, but that didn't really happen.

23:03.837 --> 23:04.618
But they did.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.040
It was right after Ho Chi Minh died.

23:07.100 --> 23:16.229
It was also the same time that the wives were starting to campaign here in this country to get better treatment for us and so on.

23:16.249 --> 23:19.652
And the treatment changed drastically overnight.

23:19.672 --> 23:23.096
There were no longer any beatings or torture.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.497
There were a few of them.

23:25.118 --> 23:26.599
Somebody that really got out of line, like

23:27.085 --> 23:33.341
72, when they resumed bombing, one of the guys cheered, and they took him out and beat him quite severely.

23:33.361 --> 23:38.674
But for the most part, the real rough stuff stopped.

23:38.694 --> 23:42.343
And the interrogations, which

23:42.813 --> 23:44.616
Well, we called them quizzes.

23:44.857 --> 23:50.507
They were more interested in your political views than anything or what the status of your family was.

23:50.668 --> 23:52.010
Right, your social status.

23:52.030 --> 23:52.271
Right.

23:52.591 --> 23:53.553
Exactly.

23:53.573 --> 23:55.657
And that was their big interest.

23:55.677 --> 24:01.748
I remember asking you what, because we're talking over a six-year period here, and I remember asking you, what was your day-to-day routine?

24:01.789 --> 24:02.610
What did you do?

24:03.080 --> 24:04.442
Very interesting what you told me.

24:04.462 --> 24:10.772
You talked about how you all would actually talk out movies that you had seen or books that you have read.

24:10.792 --> 24:16.721
There was one fellow, I think you said, that actually had in his memory 200 movies that he'd go through the whole movie.

24:16.741 --> 24:20.367
So you would actually watch movies through the memories of fellow POWs.

24:20.387 --> 24:21.289
Right.

24:21.309 --> 24:22.310
Watch them in your mind, that is.

24:22.330 --> 24:22.470
Right.

24:22.611 --> 24:25.595
And then we also have some people talk classes.

24:25.896 --> 24:26.016
Right.

24:26.570 --> 24:38.668
And we had one individual went to SMU and passed the test for German, French, and Spanish from the languages that he learned in POW camp.

24:38.688 --> 24:41.853
So you sort of had class, so to speak.

24:41.913 --> 24:42.974
You had teachers that taught.

24:43.034 --> 24:44.497
You had people that remembered movies.

24:44.757 --> 24:52.208
And later you would see movies and you would, as you saw them on the screen, you would remember those movies being told to you while you were a POW.

24:52.228 --> 24:53.590
Let's talk about, we've got about

24:53.924 --> 24:55.506
Just about two and a half minutes left now.

24:55.846 --> 24:59.150
Let's talk about when you went home in 1973 real quick.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.333
Talk about how that all came about.

25:01.353 --> 25:03.996
Oh, okay.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.940
We were in a camp up on the Chinese border and they took us to Hanoi.

25:07.960 --> 25:15.609
And we were in Hanoi and they read the agreements to us that they had made in Paris about releasing POWs.

25:15.629 --> 25:18.733
And each of us was given a copy of these agreements.

25:19.253 --> 25:22.297
And so we knew when we were going to come home, pretty much.

25:22.778 --> 25:24.820
I was very solidly in the second group.

25:24.860 --> 25:30.248
They were going to be sick and wounded first, and then it was going to be by date of capture.

25:30.268 --> 25:37.057
And so I was pretty solidly in the middle of the second group, depending on how many sick and wounded there were going to be.

25:37.097 --> 25:38.959
And I think there were 30-some sick and wounded.

25:39.219 --> 25:43.405
And then on February the 12th, the first group went home.

25:43.385 --> 25:47.189
Then there was a longer delay between the first group and the second group.

25:47.209 --> 25:49.913
You didn't get to go home when you thought you were going to get to go home.

25:49.973 --> 25:50.173
Right.

25:50.774 --> 26:00.345
They lined us up in the courtyard one night, and the camp commander told us that, you know, today was the day for you to go home, but the United States is not living up to the agreement, so you're not going to get to go home.

26:01.246 --> 26:06.973
And so morale dropped, and then about a week later, you know, things started getting a little better.

26:07.073 --> 26:11.518
And on Sunday, March the 4th, the 141 showed up.

26:11.988 --> 26:19.098
And they took us to the airport and we got on the 141s and flew from Hanoi to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.

26:20.480 --> 26:31.857
And what do you remember about that time and realizing that you had survived this six-year ordeal and that you would be able to go home and see a couple of kids that you hadn't seen in six years?

26:32.398 --> 26:35.222
Well, it was quite an ecstatic feeling.

26:35.282 --> 26:38.687
It was, I don't know, my wife always gets mad at me when I say this.

26:39.127 --> 26:41.050
I felt like I got hit over the head with a hammer.

26:41.992 --> 26:43.515
It was that overwhelming.

26:43.535 --> 26:44.236
Indeed it was.

26:44.397 --> 26:44.617
Yeah.

26:44.958 --> 26:45.579
Indeed it was.

26:46.581 --> 26:48.084
And still overwhelming to you today.

26:48.104 --> 26:49.226
Yes.

26:49.246 --> 26:52.632
That you're here and that you've been able to.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.276
Appreciate life a whole lot.

26:54.456 --> 26:57.241
Watch your family grow up and two wonderful grandchildren.

26:57.261 --> 26:57.442
Yes.

26:57.702 --> 26:59.205
Thank you very much for your service.

26:59.245 --> 27:00.728
It's been an honor speaking to you.

27:00.748 --> 27:01.249
You're welcome.

27:02.005 --> 27:12.521
Needless to say, Lieutenant Colonel Al Meyer counts himself lucky to have lived the long life that he has, to have survived the unimaginable ordeal of torture and the separation as a Vietnam POW.

27:13.101 --> 27:20.813
His wife, Bobby, two sons and two grandkids are indeed the main benefactors of that fortune, as are we all who celebrate freedom every day.

27:21.374 --> 27:27.082
We salute Lieutenant Colonel Al Meyer and all veterans who came home and those who did not.
