00:00.031 --> 00:24.886
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:25.227 --> 00:26.308
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:26.913 --> 00:33.161
Last time on Veterans of the Valley, we started the story of service of Major General Thomas G. Darling of College Station.

00:33.621 --> 00:43.754
You heard of his experiences as a pilot of the B-36 and the B-52, the harrowing days of the Cuban Missile Crisis and his 46 combat missions into Vietnam.

00:43.774 --> 00:53.106
Vietnam was almost over, but his career of military service had barely begun, a career that ended where it started at Texas A&M when Thomas Darling,

00:53.525 --> 00:56.910
Aggie Class of 54, became Commandant of the Corps of Cadets.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.476
We welcome back General Thomas Darling to Veterans of the Valley.

01:00.496 --> 01:09.230
Sort of in more review, we'll talk about that you were born, you grew up in Abilene, you came to Texas A&M in 1950, played on that 50-51 basketball team.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.854
You finished in 1954, you wanted to fly.

01:11.834 --> 01:16.342
You went to Arizona for flying school and eventually got into the B-36s and the B-52s.

01:16.382 --> 01:19.107
That sort of catches us up with where we were.

01:19.127 --> 01:25.439
You talked about your experiences with the Cuban Missile Crisis and having to fly the B-52 on those 24-hour missions.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.887
And I think when we last visited with you, we had gotten you to Vietnam.

01:29.907 --> 01:31.730
Let's sort of start back there again.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.896
You were a B-52 pilot in Vietnam stationed out of Guam.

01:34.916 --> 01:35.918
Yes.

01:36.421 --> 01:42.569
deployed as the entire unit from Turner Air Force Base to Guam, a 17-hour mission.

01:43.430 --> 01:48.857
And I remember how hot and humid it was when we stepped off that plane, and I thought, wow, this is going to be tough.

01:50.098 --> 01:53.282
But anyway, we were quickly thrown into the schedule.

01:53.303 --> 01:56.246
In fact, the very next night, my crew flew a mission.

01:56.346 --> 02:01.213
We had some people with us to look over our shoulder to make sure we did everything right.

02:02.554 --> 02:04.637
That was a 12-and-a-half-hour mission.

02:04.677 --> 02:06.259
That was a typical mission out of

02:06.695 --> 02:09.059
Guam to Vietnam and back.

02:09.079 --> 02:11.722
Because that required refueling, just the flight to Vietnam.

02:11.742 --> 02:12.484
Yes, it did.

02:12.504 --> 02:26.765
We would take off usually in the early morning hours, somewhere 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, and flying in three-ship cell formations, usually 15 to 18 airplanes.

02:26.785 --> 02:33.715
And we would fly up toward Okinawa, and we'd each refuel from a tanker.

02:34.218 --> 02:38.626
take on probably 100,000 pounds or more and then head toward Vietnam.

02:39.968 --> 02:43.474
Most of our missions were in South Vietnam.

02:43.494 --> 02:51.789
Most of them were saturation kind of bombing where one airplane could cover an area, say, three miles long and one mile wide.

02:53.652 --> 02:59.162
But the missions were long and grueling.

02:59.767 --> 03:07.295
We would be up several hours before takeoff doing mission planning, target study.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.897
We'd have the briefings before we were supposed to strike.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.040
We wouldn't know until we got to the briefing.

03:13.060 --> 03:17.925
But then certain crew members had an individualized study that they had to perform.

03:17.945 --> 03:29.537
But then we'd all meet, the chaplain would lead a prayer, and we'd go out to the airplane in the night and get ready to launch.

03:30.412 --> 03:36.239
Coasting into Vietnam, we generally put on flak vests and all of that.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.843
As I said, most of our missions were in South Vietnam.

03:39.863 --> 03:56.824
We did make these two missions into North Vietnam shortly after I got there to try to fill in this Mugea Pass and stop the Ho Chi Minh Trail from resupplying South Vietnam.

03:57.901 --> 04:05.072
The schedule required that usually about every third day you would launch on one of these missions.

04:05.092 --> 04:14.346
A mission day, a 12 and a half hour mission, plus all the pre-flight, the mission study, and then the debriefing after you get back.

04:14.366 --> 04:16.950
They went into great effort to debrief us on each mission.

04:18.072 --> 04:22.238
So it made a long day and you were ready for the SAC, but North

04:23.045 --> 04:30.834
soon as you woke up you're about ready to go on another one like this so that's what I did for repeatedly there in 1966.

04:31.855 --> 04:46.912
The Vietnam War is one that will be debated in history books for as long as there is time I'm sure and you said that you told me earlier that fighting the Vietnam War because of the politics of it all sometimes you felt like you were fighting with one arm behind your back sort of explain about that.

04:46.932 --> 04:48.073
Well we did.

04:48.661 --> 04:51.445
We thought we could end this war pretty quickly.

04:51.465 --> 04:57.715
I think that was the feeling when we got in, but it went on year after year, and we all know the history of that.

04:59.037 --> 05:03.944
But there was times when we would step up our activity.

05:04.125 --> 05:08.671
Bombing would be a little more intense and go a little deeper.

05:09.413 --> 05:13.639
Then we'd back off hoping for a response, which never really came, I don't think.

05:14.277 --> 05:22.250
And it wasn't until the Christmas time, 1972, that we did launch an all-out effort.

05:22.791 --> 05:28.660
I think there were roughly 130 B-52s in Guam and in Thailand at that time.

05:28.740 --> 05:36.893
And all of those were put into the effort there in what we call the 11-Day War, starting on 18 December.

05:37.598 --> 05:42.471
and they launched and we lost some, we took some pretty heavy losses in that.

05:43.153 --> 05:47.625
But by the 26th of December,

05:48.668 --> 05:54.515
North Vietnamese had run out of missiles and everything else, and their defenses were gone.

05:55.096 --> 06:00.083
But on the 26th of December, I believe it was the day that they decided they were ready to talk again.

06:00.944 --> 06:14.381
So I think it was the first time in the war, at least from the strategic air command standpoint, that we were unleashed to do our thing, and it didn't take 10 days really to get some action.

06:14.822 --> 06:17.545
So the actions that you were involved in definitely

06:17.744 --> 06:20.187
were involved in their decision to start talking.

06:20.327 --> 06:20.807
I think so.

06:21.188 --> 06:21.969
Exactly.

06:21.989 --> 06:26.294
There was other airplanes and other weapon systems involved in that.

06:26.314 --> 06:33.081
I wouldn't put it all on the B-52, but it had the major, carried the major load there in those last days.

06:33.141 --> 06:35.444
It was an intimidating aircraft, there's no doubt about it.

06:36.926 --> 06:43.313
I've talked to combat pilots before that have told me that if they were to list the three things that most concerned them when they were flying,

06:43.478 --> 06:51.465
They would talk about weather, they'd talk about mechanics, and they'd talk about the enemy, and some even put them in that order as things that most concerned them when flying.

06:51.485 --> 06:55.148
You had some pretty hairy episodes with weather, one, going back to Guam.

06:55.168 --> 06:55.809
Talk about that.

06:56.610 --> 06:56.730
Right.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.072
Weather was always a factor out in the Pacific.

06:59.192 --> 07:02.555
The time I was there, we got into the rainy, so-called rainy season.

07:02.575 --> 07:12.844
It just rained all the time, but clouds would bubble up in no time, but typhoons would come through, and I mentioned our tankers were evacuated on that one mission from Okinawa to

07:13.499 --> 07:18.324
avoid a big typhoon coming that way, but always having to dodge weather.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.186
And I remember one mission coming back.

07:23.008 --> 07:30.816
We were, oh, maybe 300 miles out of Guam and the report was that the weather was getting extremely poor.

07:31.837 --> 07:40.485
And it was too late to launch a tanker at that point and we were pretty much committed to having to land at Guam.

07:41.157 --> 07:48.107
That was some of the roughest weather and one of the most harrowing approaches and landings I've ever made in any airplane.

07:49.469 --> 07:55.238
We were in formation trying to keep from running into each other.

07:55.258 --> 08:03.971
We're in trail formation and we had to monitor the airplane in front of you's altitude and speed and all of that and keep your spacing.

08:04.011 --> 08:09.139
And when you're doing that in thick, heavy, bouncing weather, it's not easy.

08:09.845 --> 08:15.112
Anyway, I was able to get down to the landing pattern altitude and couldn't see a thing.

08:15.152 --> 08:17.496
The rain was just pounding on the airplane.

08:18.377 --> 08:27.409
The wind was a direct crosswind, and I had to crank in maximum crosswind crab into this B-52, which has a unique system.

08:28.611 --> 08:33.177
The nose of the airplane is pointing into the wind, sort of, but the wheels are aligned with the runway.

08:33.738 --> 08:38.805
So you're looking out the side window almost to go down the runway, but

08:39.342 --> 09:06.085
Still couldn't see anything, and it was a 300-foot ceiling, which we finally were able to break out and sight the runway, and the rain was just pouring down, just hammering us, and was able to get the airplane down safely, and I never felt such a relief in my life as I did landing the airplane that day, knowing that I had an expensive airplane and a crew of six and all that I was responsible for.

09:06.266 --> 09:06.706
Yes, sir.

09:07.166 --> 09:07.847
I would imagine.

09:08.317 --> 09:12.242
We need to move on, move on past Vietnam and continue with your career.

09:13.363 --> 09:15.166
You went from Vietnam.

09:15.186 --> 09:19.851
You went to the SAC headquarters, I believe, in Omaha there for four years, promoted to lieutenant colonel.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.715
And then eventually you were at Navy War College.

09:22.735 --> 09:26.400
Here's an Air Force guy that was going to serve some time with the Navy.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.061
That's right.

09:27.081 --> 09:34.690
I knew I'd been selected based on my promotion to lieutenant colonel to go to one of the senior service schools.

09:35.111 --> 09:37.834
Well, I assumed it would be the Air Force War College.

09:38.371 --> 09:40.655
down at Maxwell Air Force, Alabama.

09:41.337 --> 09:50.334
But I had a call one day from a good friend down at the Military Personnel Center in San Antonio, and he said, Tom, how do you like ships?

09:51.476 --> 09:53.139
And I said, I don't know what you're talking about.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.361
I said, I like ships fine.

09:54.401 --> 09:55.283
He says, well,

09:56.022 --> 09:56.703
Think again.

09:57.083 --> 09:57.664
Guess again.

09:58.224 --> 10:02.388
What he was trying to tell me was I'd been selected to go to the Naval War College.

10:02.408 --> 10:03.829
I did get orders to go there.

10:03.849 --> 10:04.991
I was very surprised.

10:06.132 --> 10:07.133
No dealings with the Navy.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.935
Didn't understand the lingo and all of that.

10:10.055 --> 10:22.367
But I did go to the Naval War College and along with about, I think, 16 other Air Force officers, they brought us in a week and gave us a tour on a submarine, a destroyer, and they couldn't have been nicer to us.

10:22.516 --> 10:30.045
And I had a great year at a very distinguished place there at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

10:30.065 --> 10:33.890
Something you weren't too sure about, but then it became really a thrilling time in your life.

10:33.910 --> 10:34.791
It was, it was.

10:34.811 --> 10:47.787
I went on to the Pentagon in 1972, more of a sort of a political type job as a personal plans officer, where you met some, you were working for some folks that were a little rough for you.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.188
Quickly sort of tell that story.

10:49.929 --> 10:51.291
Okay, this is...

10:51.997 --> 11:04.615
1972, I guess it was, I came out of the Naval War College and I was assigned to personnel plans on the air staff at the Pentagon.

11:04.635 --> 11:09.162
And I'd talk to people about it and they told me kind of what I would be doing.

11:09.412 --> 11:14.981
My job would be to help develop some permanent grade legislation for the Air Force.

11:15.001 --> 11:19.949
We didn't have permanent grades since the Air Force had been established as a separate service.

11:19.969 --> 11:25.778
We'd have to go back each year with temporary legislation, and they wanted to get beyond this.

11:25.798 --> 11:29.825
So that was going to be one of my duties in that job.

11:30.526 --> 11:34.913
Well, I'd been there about two or three weeks, and I had a call from

11:35.534 --> 11:52.534
the director of personnel's office saying that I should come up the next day and meet with the general, the three-star general who was the head guy for Air Force personnel, human resource, if you would, resources.

11:52.555 --> 11:57.120
So I go up at 10 o'clock the next morning and check in with his secretary.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.294
She tells me to take a seat.

11:59.334 --> 12:03.620
They're having a meeting in his office there that's been extended a little bit.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.804
So I wait and wait, 10.30, 11, 11.30.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.406
The door never opened.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.268
They're still in there.

12:09.408 --> 12:13.313
So I knew it must be a kind of a brutal meeting going on in there to be that long.

12:14.295 --> 12:19.562
Well, about 11.50, the secretary says, well, you might as well go back to your office.

12:19.602 --> 12:20.543
We'll reschedule it.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.524
It's not going to happen.

12:22.065 --> 12:24.188
About that time, the door opens and I see a

12:24.758 --> 12:28.264
Half a dozen really whip-looking guys coming out of a meeting.

12:28.945 --> 12:32.090
Obviously, the briefing had gotten to them pretty much.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.914
They had a pretty hard charge, I could tell.

12:33.974 --> 12:36.418
And she says, wait a minute.

12:36.438 --> 12:37.960
Says, let me check with the general.

12:37.980 --> 12:39.603
He may want to see you.

12:39.623 --> 12:40.304
Well, she did.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.708
Came back and said, yeah, he would want to see you.

12:43.249 --> 12:45.433
Says, just push the door open and go on in.

12:46.240 --> 12:59.458
Well, I push the big white door open and go into this huge office and there's his big desk and he's got his head buried and stuff on his desk and I move in front of his desk and I'm ready to salute him as soon as he will look up.

12:59.478 --> 13:00.680
He never looks up at me.

13:00.700 --> 13:05.727
He just keeps going and finally he barks something at me and never looks at me.

13:06.728 --> 13:15.360
And you know, I try to salute him or something and he proceeds to start asking me a bunch of tough questions like, Colonel, what do you think your job is?

13:15.380 --> 13:15.640
And

13:16.042 --> 13:23.737
I tried to tell him, and he didn't think I knew very well what my job was, so he was going to help me a little bit, I think.

13:23.817 --> 13:28.646
But he was really there to put a little fear in me, I think.

13:29.588 --> 13:33.695
And I told him about this grade legislation thing I'd be working on.

13:33.775 --> 13:37.683
He said, let me tell you, Colonel, you better get that passed this year.

13:37.843 --> 13:39.366
You better get it passed.

13:39.886 --> 13:51.721
And then he stands up and he puts his finger right on my chest and he says, Colonel, let me tell you, you don't get that pass, you just think of the worst place in the world I can send you, and that's where I'm sending you.

13:51.741 --> 13:54.464
I mean, you know, steely-eyed and all.

13:54.484 --> 13:55.565
And I said, yes, sir.

13:56.406 --> 13:59.250
And he dismissed me, and it ruined my whole weekend, of course.

14:00.111 --> 14:02.234
But I got to know this man better.

14:02.254 --> 14:03.635
He went on to make four stars.

14:03.655 --> 14:08.982
He's a brilliant man, but he had this way of dealing with people through fear.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.475
You know, it worked.

14:11.696 --> 14:12.257
Indeed it did.

14:12.638 --> 14:18.025
We're going to move forward rather quickly now because I want to get to your time at Texas A&M.

14:18.046 --> 14:20.729
You spent two years as a wing commander.

14:20.789 --> 14:24.515
You went to the SAC headquarters in a staff job, spent 18 months there.

14:25.016 --> 14:31.645
You went to school actually at the University of Pittsburgh as a management school there, executive training.

14:32.047 --> 14:36.513
promoted to a brigadier general at about this time, director of personnel for SAC for three years.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.676
The resume just goes on and on, folks.

14:38.736 --> 14:39.337
It really does.

14:40.739 --> 14:43.983
You went to this mid-career school and joint operations there.

14:44.003 --> 14:46.346
It became a component of the Air Defense University.

14:46.406 --> 14:47.949
Talk a little bit about what that was.

14:47.969 --> 15:00.906
Okay, after completing a tour at SAC, I'm surprised to find I was going to the Armed Forces Staff College to be the commandant, or the head of the school, sort of the president, if you would, which is a very distinguished mid-career

15:01.257 --> 15:23.839
school primarily to teach joint planning joint operation when i signed in there in norfolk virginia beautiful campus most prestigious place my boss was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff but within a week i had a message saying that there was a restructuring going on they were going to create the national defense university

15:24.190 --> 15:28.074
which would include three component schools.

15:28.094 --> 15:35.382
My school, the Armed Forces Staff College, the National War College, and the Industrial College, both located in Washington.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.104
So that's the way we were organized there.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.207
I reported to a boss in Washington.

15:41.088 --> 15:44.231
I went up there every week for staff meetings.

15:44.251 --> 15:49.236
But it was an opportunity for me as commandant of that school to

15:49.469 --> 16:00.928
much as when I'd been a wing commander to use my own initiative and try my leadership skills and test out some of the training and ideas that I had.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.531
It was a great tour for me.

16:03.252 --> 16:07.900
Wonderful students, most of them with masters, some of them with PhDs, highly motivated.

16:08.521 --> 16:11.385
but really a plumb of an assignment.

16:11.405 --> 16:23.562
We had speakers from all throughout the military, top people from universities, other places, just a wonderful experience there at the Armed Forces Staff College.

16:23.582 --> 16:30.691
Some of the students that were mine then were majors, lieutenant colonels, and many of those went on to make general, four-star general even.

16:30.952 --> 16:35.818
Right, went to California as a vice commander of the 15th Air Force, two years there, got to fly a U-2.

16:35.858 --> 16:37.060
We'll see a picture of that.

16:37.276 --> 16:38.197
here in a moment.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.382
Back to Norfolk as the deputy commander in chief of the U.S.

16:41.462 --> 16:45.047
Atlantic Command, where your boss there was a four-star admiral, right?

16:45.068 --> 16:49.214
Yes, I was selected to go back to sort of be with the Navy, if you would.

16:49.254 --> 16:52.078
I lived on a Navy installation.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.503
I was the deputy commander for one of the unified command, U.S.

16:56.524 --> 16:59.569
Sinkland, primarily a maritime command.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.973
My boss was a four-star admiral.

17:02.013 --> 17:03.655
He was a wonderful fellow to work for.

17:04.090 --> 17:07.535
treated me very well, gave me a lot of good opportunities.

17:09.237 --> 17:18.671
One time he had to be out of country, and he sent me to Washington to testify before one of the Senate subcommittees, which scared the daylights out of me.

17:19.211 --> 17:22.576
I mean, you work pretty hard for a couple of weeks to get ready for one of those.

17:22.757 --> 17:23.558
Indeed.

17:23.578 --> 17:25.721
I want to move on because I need to get you to Texas A&M.

17:25.741 --> 17:31.549
We never have enough time on these shows, but you were actually serving back at Norfolk again.

17:31.968 --> 17:39.298
And you got a letter from a gentleman named John Koldis at Texas A&M saying that they were looking for a commandant of the Corps.

17:40.139 --> 17:43.464
And that's what eventually brought you to Texas A&M.

17:43.484 --> 17:48.410
Sort of reflect on that time and your decision to come back to your alma mater to work.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.613
Well, I was surprised to hear from John Koldis.

17:50.673 --> 17:54.919
He explained to me that A&M was looking to hire their own commandant.

17:54.939 --> 17:57.823
There's a little bit of a change from what they'd had before.

17:58.192 --> 18:06.984
Normally the army professor of military science and tactics served as a commandant as well, but they wanted their own commandant apparently.

18:07.004 --> 18:13.713
And they were contacting various people and they wanted to know if I would be interested in being a candidate.

18:13.733 --> 18:22.866
After some exchange of information and he came up to visit me, I came down here and ended up I was selected for that job.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.703
I went in to see my four-star admiral to tell him about it.

18:26.763 --> 18:34.729
I had two more years before mandatory retirement, and I was kind of torn whether I wanted to come back to A&M then or serve my last two years, but

18:35.249 --> 18:40.916
He told me he thought I had a great opportunity and he'd give his blessings to me coming to A&M.

18:40.936 --> 18:46.303
So that summer I'd retired from the Air Force after 33 years and did come to Texas A&M.

18:46.483 --> 18:48.105
August of 1987 that was.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.949
This is a good time to stop and let's look at some photographs that we have.

18:51.009 --> 18:56.616
And before we wrap this up, let's go to some pictures that belong to Texas A&M.

18:57.423 --> 19:00.528
General Darling, talk about this picture real quick.

19:00.548 --> 19:08.079
Well, this was when I was assigned to March Air Force Base as 15th Air Force commander in 1985-86.

19:10.162 --> 19:14.950
We were receiving the new KC-10 cargo tanker plane.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.856
It was a military version of the DC-10.

19:19.697 --> 19:26.367
And the people at McDonnell Douglas would roll out about one a month, and they'd invite a senior officer to come over and fly the airplane out.

19:26.887 --> 19:32.954
So this is one of the vice presidents there shaking hands with me, and that's the airplane behind one.

19:33.215 --> 19:39.823
Behind me was a brand new airplane, and I got to make the first takeoff and refueling with this aircraft.

19:39.843 --> 19:42.506
Okay, let's move on.

19:42.526 --> 19:50.396
While I was at 15th, we were responsible for most of the reconnaissance assets in the Air Force, the U-2 being one of them.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.940
This is the one that identified the Soviet missiles in Cuba and

19:54.562 --> 20:01.432
done a lot of other great work for many years, but they felt I should have the opportunity to experience you too.

20:01.532 --> 20:02.814
So I went up.

20:02.854 --> 20:04.195
That's my instructor there.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.779
At the bottom shows us taking off.

20:06.859 --> 20:19.136
At the top picture is after the flight, and we're walking away from the airplane, but they had to wear that full pressure suit, and we did get above 70,000 feet that day, and it was a great experience.

20:19.697 --> 20:23.202
It gave me a great appreciation for what that airplane can do.

20:23.418 --> 20:25.581
That comes close to making you an astronaut.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.686
What are we looking at there?

20:28.706 --> 20:33.273
This is back at Norfolk when I was leaving the Armed Forces Staff College.

20:33.293 --> 20:34.855
That is me in the white uniform.

20:34.895 --> 20:36.998
We did have a white uniform back in those days.

20:37.099 --> 20:38.140
Right.

20:38.160 --> 20:44.029
That's General Norm Anderson there, a Marine, but he's presenting me the MacArthur Medallion.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.075
He was with the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk and

20:48.410 --> 20:53.175
We'd established a very close relationship with that organization there at the Staff College.

20:53.915 --> 21:03.464
They seemed to appreciate all that I'd done and helped promote the name of MacArthur and do things for Mrs. MacArthur.

21:03.524 --> 21:15.316
And they presented me that gold medallion, which is a gold, heavy gold medallion that struck my Congress and has only been presented to a few people, I understand.

21:15.336 --> 21:16.577
I know that's a great honor.

21:17.536 --> 21:21.741
There's just a photograph of you a little bit later in your uniform.

21:21.801 --> 21:24.083
Wanted to show folks that picture.

21:24.343 --> 21:25.885
Let's go ahead and move on.

21:25.905 --> 21:27.227
We've got a couple others.

21:27.247 --> 21:28.648
There's you and three other Aggies.

21:28.668 --> 21:33.273
Well, this happened, oh, about five years ago.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.698
There was a base out near the Colorado Springs.

21:37.798 --> 21:41.002
It's now known as Schriever Air Force Base.

21:41.022 --> 21:46.007
It didn't have that name at the time, but it was to be renamed in honor of General Schriever.

21:46.392 --> 21:50.361
General Schriever is the third one from the left in this picture.

21:50.441 --> 21:51.924
He died a year or so ago.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.372
He was well up into his 90s, but I got to know this man.

21:55.392 --> 21:56.194
He's an Aggie.

21:57.256 --> 22:02.528
He is the father of the space and missile forces for the United States, a brilliant man.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.667
That's Mr. Pete Aldridge on his right, who was former Secretary of the Air Force.

22:07.707 --> 22:10.852
Pete's a class of 1960, I believe it was.

22:11.553 --> 22:13.656
But he's held other high positions.

22:14.518 --> 22:18.724
That's Major General Frank Watson there in the blue suit.

22:19.025 --> 22:19.826
He was out there.

22:19.886 --> 22:22.390
And then that's me in the civilian clothes there on the left.

22:22.891 --> 22:29.641
But we were all there together to participate in this renaming of the base the Schriever Air Force Base.

22:29.661 --> 22:29.962
All right.

22:30.162 --> 22:30.743
Let's move on.

22:31.972 --> 22:36.439
Now, we're going to go ahead and talk about this now while the picture is up.

22:36.499 --> 22:45.953
Among the things that you were involved in when you were the Commandant of the Corps is that you had the vision and led the funding effort for the Sam Houston Sanders Corps of Cadet Center.

22:46.394 --> 22:49.559
Certainly a wonderful, wonderful facility that's on campus right now.

22:49.599 --> 22:52.043
I know that this is a place that's very close to your heart.

22:52.624 --> 22:53.185
Well, it is.

22:53.245 --> 22:54.807
I'm very proud of this.

22:55.259 --> 23:04.669
Still can't believe the opportunity we had to develop the support and the funding and all for this facility.

23:04.689 --> 23:14.239
When I came to A&M in 88, it seemed to me we really didn't have an adequate place in the Corps of Cadets to take visitors, display our proud history.

23:15.620 --> 23:19.724
A lot of things we couldn't do because we didn't have an appropriate place.

23:19.744 --> 23:23.308
And it was at a Corps Development Council meeting my first year.

23:23.862 --> 23:31.534
that I briefed that distinguished group that is my vision within 10 years that we might have some kind of facility.

23:31.634 --> 23:44.073
It would be a combination visitor center, headquarters, meeting rooms, could display all of our flags and symbols and all of that.

23:44.093 --> 23:46.917
And I kind of outlined what I had in mind.

23:47.521 --> 23:52.535
And again, my thought was maybe in 10 years we might have something like that.

23:52.555 --> 24:02.965
Well, that evening at a social hour, one of those fellows that I'd briefed that afternoon, Mr. Harvey Cash, a very distinguished Aggie class of 33,

24:03.535 --> 24:06.838
came up to me and said, Tom, you know, you're right on this building.

24:06.858 --> 24:10.221
He says, we need it, but we need it a lot sooner than what you're talking.

24:10.682 --> 24:14.626
He says, I'm prepared to give $100,000 to help get this started.

24:14.666 --> 24:21.372
And he says, I want to call in some of these gentlemen, and we're going to see if we can raise $500,000 here in the next few minutes.

24:21.392 --> 24:21.913
Yes, sir.

24:21.933 --> 24:29.340
Well, sure enough, he called in several there, and in no time we had a large sum of money committed to this project.

24:29.590 --> 24:33.775
And I realized right then my idea was, you know, could take off.

24:34.536 --> 24:38.420
So we started briefing people around campus, Facilities and Planning.

24:38.680 --> 24:43.205
General Ed Peel bought into this completely over at Facilities and Planning.

24:43.286 --> 24:46.009
And, you know, we proceeded.

24:46.209 --> 24:49.633
We got an architect, designed the building, found the location.

24:50.574 --> 24:54.038
And we even had a line of credit from the A&M Foundation.

24:54.058 --> 24:57.241
But we never had to borrow a dime to finish this building.

24:57.261 --> 24:58.703
The contributions rolled in.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.507
This is you and your wife, Evelyn.

25:00.567 --> 25:07.113
You lost your wife this past December, but I know that she had an awful lot to do with your career and the building of this facility.

25:07.193 --> 25:08.114
Well, she did.

25:08.134 --> 25:11.778
She was a great partner and stood by me on everything.

25:12.058 --> 25:16.442
Went with me to all A&M functions and dinners and everything that we had.

25:16.482 --> 25:20.186
But that's a bench right there that was done in our honor.

25:20.866 --> 25:22.288
One of our supporters did that.

25:22.628 --> 25:26.952
There's another one over there that's also done in our honor.

25:27.438 --> 25:32.343
We're very privileged to have been here and been a part of that Corps Center project.

25:33.345 --> 25:38.130
The gentleman there with the sword is Tyson Vocal, who I've had a guest on this show, Veterans of the Valley.

25:38.210 --> 25:47.240
Tyson was the Corps commander when you were here, and a young man that you and I both have a lot of respect for, and that's him talking to you.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.662
Tell him about the honor that he was sort of giving you right there.

25:49.683 --> 25:51.224
Well, that was a surprise to me.

25:51.264 --> 25:57.411
This is Final Review, and Tyson walks up to me and says, Sir, I think you ought to lead the

25:58.083 --> 26:03.830
The troops around this time, since you're retiring, I want to give you that honor.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.452
Well, that was overwhelming to me.

26:05.532 --> 26:07.134
I had not suspected that at all.

26:07.154 --> 26:09.076
But he's explaining that to me right there.

26:09.757 --> 26:14.803
And I did end up leading the Corps in that final parade that year.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.584
That was 1996.

26:15.664 --> 26:19.529
This is that same final review.

26:19.609 --> 26:26.537
That's Dr. Ray Bowen and Dr. Malin Sutherland and myself there sawing the horns off during that.

26:28.222 --> 26:29.764
Wonderful, wonderful pictures.

26:29.804 --> 26:31.526
We just have about a minute left.

26:32.708 --> 26:38.876
Sort of wrap up your nine years as the Commandant of the Corps of Cadets.

26:38.916 --> 26:43.662
I know it's just a time that went by, but a time that's very, very meaningful to you.

26:43.682 --> 26:44.443
Well, it was.

26:44.643 --> 26:55.377
I didn't know all I was getting into when I came here, but I put myself into it and tried to do some things I thought were appropriate.

26:55.829 --> 27:01.118
One, we integrated the units to include women.

27:01.779 --> 27:03.963
A controversial move.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.147
Built the core center.

27:06.227 --> 27:08.731
We put a strong emphasis on academics.

27:09.332 --> 27:15.964
We didn't feel that we were doing well enough, and it was clear to me that that had to be our number one priority, and I'm pleased to say that

27:16.568 --> 27:20.197
For several years now, that has been a number one priority and done well.

27:20.718 --> 27:28.256
Raising scholarships, funding the Corps was a big priority, and we've just done remarkable things since then.

27:28.376 --> 27:29.118
All right.

27:29.138 --> 27:29.960
We are out of time.

27:29.980 --> 27:30.541
I'm sorry.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.907
Thank you very much for your time, and thank you for your service.

27:32.887 --> 27:33.268
Thank you.

27:33.288 --> 27:33.909
My pleasure.

27:33.949 --> 27:39.758
For 46 years, Thomas Darling wore a military uniform, and he admits that it was difficult to take it off for the last time.

27:39.818 --> 27:49.994
Suffice it to say, his impact on those that he served with and served under him and the gift of leadership he gave back to the school he loved so dearly are immeasurable indeed.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.998
We salute General Thomas Darling as we do all veterans.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.220
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:54.260 --> 27:56.143
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:07.075 --> 28:14.554
Thank you.
