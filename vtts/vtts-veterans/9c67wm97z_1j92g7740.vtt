Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.109 --> 00:39.201
I'm Tom Turbeville.

00:39.755 --> 00:46.404
The Brazos Valley, and particularly residents of Bryan, know Mike Sutherland for his service on the Bryan City Council since 2006.

00:47.445 --> 00:51.531
Many others, though, know of his 22 and a half years of military service in the U.S.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.312
Army.

00:52.332 --> 01:07.112
One year of that, February 1969 to February 1970, was spent as a chopper pilot in Vietnam, flying some 900 hours of mainly what they called ash and trash missions between Chulai and 80 miles south of Da Nang.

01:07.092 --> 01:11.696
There are some stories to tell of reconnaissance, transport, occasional assault.

01:12.457 --> 01:22.787
After Vietnam, Mike Sutherland spent another 19 years in uniform, ending his military career stationed at Bryan's 420th Engineering Brigade under General Al Jones.

01:23.288 --> 01:26.611
Please welcome Lieutenant Colonel Mike Sutherland to Veterans of the Valley.

01:27.472 --> 01:28.653
Mike, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.654
Thank you for your service.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.816
Wanted to have you on Veterans of the Valley for a long time.

01:31.856 --> 01:32.537
Appreciate you being here.

01:32.557 --> 01:33.057
Thank you, Tom.

01:33.077 --> 01:33.758
I'm glad to be here.

01:33.940 --> 01:37.607
You grew up in Louisiana, born in Shreveport, but you were drafted in 1966.

01:38.348 --> 01:48.667
And I thought it was interesting that even though you had a deferment, you decided to bypass that and go into the army because many of your friends had served and indeed were even wounded in Vietnam.

01:48.687 --> 01:50.110
That's true.

01:50.090 --> 01:56.100
My family in World War II, almost all of them served too, so that was kind of a, I think an unwritten rule that we would serve.

01:56.180 --> 02:01.048
And my mother didn't want me to volunteer, so this was a way to get volunteered is let them draft you.

02:01.348 --> 02:02.049
Right, right.

02:02.069 --> 02:02.851
And you liked the Army.

02:03.111 --> 02:06.637
You got there and you liked the Army, obviously because you spent 22 and a half years there.

02:06.657 --> 02:12.046
Yeah, when I, after the shooting stopped, you know, I found a home there and I liked the methods.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.089
As a matter of fact, I think I grew up in the Army.

02:14.474 --> 02:17.739
what I know and what I based my life on is pretty much what I was taught in the Army.

02:17.759 --> 02:18.641
Right, right.

02:18.661 --> 02:22.887
Talk about leading up to Vietnam, you went to OCS and you went to flight school.

02:22.967 --> 02:26.813
So you volunteered for those things to sort of stay stateside as long as you could, right?

02:26.833 --> 02:26.994
Exactly.

02:27.014 --> 02:32.142
Yeah, I got drafted in October 66 and went to basic training and somebody said, you want to take a test to go to OCS?

02:32.182 --> 02:33.003
And I said, what is that?

02:33.063 --> 02:33.885
And they told me what it was.

02:33.965 --> 02:35.487
I said, I'll take the test.

02:35.467 --> 02:41.953
passed that and went to OCS, and during OCS they said, we've got another test you can take, and it's to flight school.

02:42.574 --> 03:03.313
I only rode an airplane one time in my whole life, but I took the test and passed it, and so I went to flight school, and I went to Mineral Wells from May of 67, let's see, May of 67, no, that was OCS, it was 68, May of 68 until probably the September, and then we went to Fort Rooker after that.

03:03.293 --> 03:05.858
and finished up at Fort Rucker, and then there was nothing left to do.

03:05.898 --> 03:07.100
You went to Vietnam after that.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.268
And you went in country, like we said, in February 1969.

03:11.388 --> 03:11.748
Correct.

03:12.049 --> 03:18.501
Talk about your duty there, your unit there, your platoon there, and sort of the nature of your missions.

03:18.521 --> 03:25.774
I was assigned to the A Company, 123rd Aviation Battalion in the Marikawa Division, and our company supported

03:25.754 --> 03:44.742
the brigade level units and above and that's generally meant some of the platoons flew the brigade commanders and my platoon flew everything that was left over and we called it ash and trash because you flew everything from resupply bullets as one as a matter of fact one time I flew the whole division payroll the helicopter was full of money I mean it was just

03:45.042 --> 03:45.823
Totally full of money.

03:45.863 --> 03:49.688
So it was a varied thing.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.694
Like you were saying earlier, I flew sometimes on assault.

03:54.275 --> 04:00.443
Some of the units were made to have built to carry troops and put them in a fire zone.

04:01.024 --> 04:02.666
Our people were separate.

04:02.987 --> 04:04.308
Our helicopters were separate from that.

04:04.368 --> 04:06.291
But every once in a while, somebody would want to go

04:06.271 --> 04:09.635
into an area where there was a lot of fire going on, so you'd have to join one of those assaults.

04:10.016 --> 04:19.668
And it was pretty hairy because you couldn't talk to anybody, and there was firing all over the place, and there was confusion, so it was pretty bad when you weren't part of the unit itself.

04:19.688 --> 04:22.491
In one year, nearly 900 hours, you did a lot of flying.

04:22.511 --> 04:23.432
Oh yeah, we flew a lot.

04:23.993 --> 04:34.506
There was a lot of flying to do, and we flew everything from... Well, as a matter of fact, I'll talk to you a story about primarily what my platoon did was recon from...

04:34.891 --> 04:37.713
Chulai up to about 80 miles south of Da Nang on Highway 1.

04:37.753 --> 04:44.880
And we flew about 50 feet off of the ground so that the guy hanging his feet out the door could see the ground and had it been disturbed.

04:44.900 --> 04:50.244
And so if it had been disturbed, they called someone to try to find out what it was, if it was a mine or whatever, and clear it out.

04:50.965 --> 05:00.893
And so one day, I mean, one day we were flying that mission and we, for some reason, the grace of God, I drifted away from the road.

05:00.913 --> 05:03.936
And just about the time the guy looking out the door

05:04.102 --> 05:30.447
realized I was too far for him to see he hollered at me said sir get back on the road I can't see and when he said that a bomb a 500 pound bomb went off right where we would have been flying had we not drifted off it it blew our helicopter to the side but you know we didn't nobody was injured and we made it through so but it was one of those things that turns out your mistake saved your life yes sir and you know and I thought when the combat when you got killed you were too close or too soon or too far was always too something when something happened to you so

05:30.427 --> 05:30.908
Right.

05:31.449 --> 05:35.297
You were talking about you flew some at night, and interesting story.

05:35.317 --> 05:41.529
You talked about sometimes flying in from Da Nang at night, and when they tried to identify you, sometimes they'd lose you.

05:41.549 --> 05:41.950
Correct.

05:42.030 --> 05:49.465
Yeah, our navigation weren't the best in the world, and it was really, I guess, the infancy of the helicopter part of aviation.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.130
And we were, as a matter of fact, we didn't have an air corps.

05:53.250 --> 05:57.503
We were, I was an engineer assigned to fly helicopters.

05:57.523 --> 06:01.716
And so at night, we would come back from Da Nang headed towards July.

06:02.185 --> 06:08.354
And we did have some radar and they would try to identify who you were because we couldn't broadcast sometimes friend or foe.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.537
In any case, they would give you a turn.

06:10.557 --> 06:14.944
And if they turned you out over the ocean, you had to be very careful because they could lose you out over the ocean.

06:15.264 --> 06:18.509
And if you didn't know where exactly you were, you'd be lost out in the water.

06:18.529 --> 06:20.612
So you had to bathe very close.

06:20.653 --> 06:23.417
So you couldn't take anything for granted at any time.

06:23.437 --> 06:23.697
Right.

06:23.977 --> 06:26.501
Over the water, I guess that was South China Sea.

06:26.521 --> 06:28.424
South China Sea and that was a deep place.

06:29.145 --> 06:30.387
So you didn't want to go in there.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.450
Now, you flew Hueys and 086s.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.191
Correct.

06:33.211 --> 06:34.613
What are the differences between those two?

06:34.673 --> 06:44.548
Well, the Hueys that we had were used for cargo, transportation of people, and any other kind of recon missions.

06:44.748 --> 06:50.957
And the 086s were, you could fly people, but generally the primary mission of those were to

06:51.359 --> 06:53.282
to fly rocket recons.

06:53.302 --> 07:06.500
And what we would do is we would fly the 086 right at the top of the trees, and sometimes these were at night, and you'd have a Huey with a big light on it that would be shining on the ground, and then above that you would have a gunship.

07:06.560 --> 07:15.833
So the idea was when the bad guy shot at you right above the trees, then the gunship would come in and take care of him, assuming you didn't get shot down.

07:16.674 --> 07:18.396
And the real bad thing of that was when that

07:18.612 --> 07:21.816
that big flashlight went over a hill, you couldn't see anything.

07:21.856 --> 07:26.442
All you could see is where the flashlight was and you couldn't see where the ground was or anything.

07:26.502 --> 07:29.145
We had to muddle through a bunch of stuff like that.

07:29.165 --> 07:38.096
You mentioned the dicey incidents that you were involved in as a helicopter pilot.

07:38.436 --> 07:48.248
One time you talked about a platoon sergeant that was just about through with his tour and he came to you and said that he wanted to fly one of his last missions with you and it turned out that

07:49.088 --> 07:50.269
That one got a little hairy.

07:50.630 --> 07:55.275
Yeah, it was his last time to fly, and I felt bad about it.

07:55.555 --> 07:59.960
You know, you have a feeling, and I said, you know, I don't think you ought to do this.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.681
You ought to stay home.

08:00.761 --> 08:01.942
I mean, you don't have but a week left.

08:02.422 --> 08:10.391
So in any case, so he wanted to fly, and he didn't, the door gunners had an M60 machine gun normally, but he didn't use an M60 machine gun.

08:10.411 --> 08:14.556
He used an M16, a rifle that he held at Port Arms.

08:15.116 --> 08:17.779
And he sat in the well, and we were reconning the road,

08:18.164 --> 08:22.532
and we came to a row of trees, bamboo stuff that we had to get up over.

08:22.552 --> 08:32.950
So I had to raise the helicopter up a little bit to get a little high, and when I did, there was a Vietnamese on the other side with a .50 cal machine gun, and he just filled the bottom of the helicopter up.

08:33.520 --> 08:47.399
and everybody was hollering and screaming, and they were hollering that my platoon sergeant had been killed because he was slumped over in the well, and the guy sitting behind me, the rounds were going up by his feet, and so he was really screaming and hollering.

08:47.419 --> 09:02.700
So we didn't, the first thing you do is to figure out what's happened to the engine, because you've got to have the engine and the transmission to fly and land, so I knew that was okay because I knew what the gauges were like, and I knew in those days, it's remarkable how much you can remember in terms of

09:03.153 --> 09:06.938
your location, wherever you are, because your life depends on it.

09:06.998 --> 09:10.162
And so I knew that we were near a soccer field.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.345
So I made it to the soccer field and landed.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.246
Everything was fine.

09:14.067 --> 09:17.111
But the crew chief, my platoon sergeant, was still out.

09:17.572 --> 09:19.594
So we went back to check on him.

09:19.614 --> 09:24.340
And a round had hit that M16 and hit his chest and knocked him out.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.061
So he wasn't dead.

09:25.121 --> 09:26.403
He was just knocked out.

09:26.423 --> 09:27.945
If it hadn't been for that M16, though,

09:27.925 --> 09:29.631
It's one of those deals he'd been hit.

09:29.651 --> 09:30.955
Yeah, the gun he didn't like.

09:31.337 --> 09:31.658
Exactly.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.203
Yeah, exactly.

09:33.223 --> 09:37.598
But you as a pilot, and you talk about a stress situation, you're hearing all of this.

09:37.763 --> 09:38.904
You're not sure who's wounded.

09:39.125 --> 09:40.647
Is the platoon sergeant dead?

09:40.667 --> 09:46.414
But you still have to keep your head, find out a safe place to land, looking at all the gauges.

09:46.474 --> 09:48.257
So this is where your training really comes in.

09:48.277 --> 09:48.938
Correct, exactly.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.281
And the Army did a tremendous job on our training.

09:52.082 --> 09:58.110
Most of us were, I was 22 and I was in charge of the platoon, but the pilots were between 19 and 21.

09:58.730 --> 10:01.614
So we were all really teenagers, and it was just like we had motorcycles.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.896
We could do anything with them.

10:03.276 --> 10:04.598
Fearless, no problem with them.

10:04.898 --> 10:07.984
there was no mission that was too hard for us to tackle.

10:09.867 --> 10:16.119
Another incident you talked about where you had just come off of R&R and you had a big load and a takeoff situation.

10:17.662 --> 10:20.106
You find things to do as a routine way

10:21.487 --> 10:23.949
that work for you and that are safe for you.

10:23.969 --> 10:39.424
And we had this one LZ that was on top of the hill and we routinely went in there and picked up troops and cargo and they were so heavy that you couldn't hover well so you would move to the edge of the hill and then let the helicopter drift down the hill until you got enough speed to start it flying.

10:39.444 --> 10:45.690
Well, I was gone for about a week on R&R with my wife in Hawaii and came back and we did the same thing.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.333
Loaded it up, started drifting down the hill, got to the bottom of the hill

10:49.769 --> 10:56.178
And the unit down there had put up a large grouping of a telephone wire.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.081
And it was a pretty good size deal.

10:59.462 --> 11:02.746
And so I didn't see it until it was right at eye level.

11:02.786 --> 11:07.593
So the bubble, I mean, I'm sitting in the bubble and the bubble's here and the wires are across there.

11:07.613 --> 11:08.934
And, you know, what do you do?

11:08.954 --> 11:09.675
Do you go under it?

11:09.796 --> 11:09.976
No.

11:10.857 --> 11:14.702
Couldn't go under it because the blade was too tall and it would snap off the rotor.

11:14.722 --> 11:19.168
So then you could try to raise it up and try to go over it, but you didn't have enough speed.

11:19.385 --> 11:20.768
and you didn't have enough power to get over it.

11:21.549 --> 11:34.335
So the only thing I could do was just try to create a situation where it was belly up or skids up and it went to the wires with both skids up and hit the wires and it flipped over and started flying like a slingshot.

11:34.655 --> 11:37.261
But it knocked all the commo out in the area there.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.026
They were so mad at me they could have killed me when I came back.

11:40.293 --> 11:40.934
But we made it.

11:40.974 --> 11:41.454
Nobody got it.

11:41.474 --> 11:42.556
They should have told you about the pants.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.056
Yeah, that's right.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.558
We should have had something hanging on it.

11:44.878 --> 11:49.684
Nowadays, on the helicopters, they have these wire cutters that are on those things, and that's what it's for.

11:49.724 --> 11:53.749
So if you get involved in that thing, it'll cut it and not tear the helicopter up.

11:53.769 --> 12:01.919
And the problem is you have to worry about getting it back too far because the rotor would bend the mast, dent the mast, and it'll snap off.

12:01.939 --> 12:08.747
They train you so well that all this stuff goes through at one time, and you can accommodate it.

12:09.183 --> 12:12.028
I guess through the grace of God, too, but, I mean, make it through.

12:12.949 --> 12:20.000
You talked about sort of the makeup of these chopper pilots, and I think people forget, you know, these kids were 18, 19, 20 years old.

12:20.201 --> 12:21.943
You were a little bit older.

12:22.084 --> 12:22.684
I was 22.

12:23.185 --> 12:29.936
You were an old man in that, but these guys were great pilots, but they were kind of daredevilish, too, right?

12:29.976 --> 12:30.978
Oh, yes.

12:31.178 --> 12:33.722
The main problem for me as the platoon leader is that

12:34.006 --> 12:36.310
They thought they could do anything and they tried anything.

12:36.350 --> 12:40.518
They flew under bridges and flew too low and hit birds and had all kinds of strikes.

12:40.538 --> 12:43.885
And so when they did that, the helicopter couldn't fly on a mission.

12:43.905 --> 12:45.648
So we were always fighting over that.

12:45.668 --> 12:46.770
You know, they shouldn't be doing that.

12:47.151 --> 12:49.415
Fly them so they can make sure they're not injured in any kind of way.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.118
But those guys were great pilots.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.060
I can't say enough about them.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.302
I have a story about that, too.

12:53.322 --> 12:56.368
I had this one guy that was his second tour and he would get mad.

12:57.057 --> 13:00.860
After he came, they thought that when they were done flying, everything was off.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.122
Nothing else had to do.

13:02.302 --> 13:03.182
They didn't have to do anything else.

13:03.223 --> 13:09.628
So he would get mad in the evening, and he would take his, he had a machine gun, and he would shoot his machine gun off in his hooch where he lived.

13:10.149 --> 13:12.010
I mean, shoot it in the floor or at somebody.

13:12.311 --> 13:14.413
So I said, well, you can't do that.

13:14.433 --> 13:15.493
And he said, oh, yeah.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.495
I said, okay, I'm taking it from you.

13:17.515 --> 13:18.476
You can't take that from me.

13:18.496 --> 13:24.021
So I took his weapon and made him check it in and out with me when he left and when he came back.

13:24.061 --> 13:25.022
So that was it.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.502
That was one of those things you just have to deal with.

13:26.522 --> 13:31.251
I mean, it's so, you know, it's so, they're rules, but they're really not any rules.

13:31.271 --> 13:35.078
You just have to watch out and try to solve problems all the time and accommodate people.

13:35.618 --> 13:44.795
You talked about another time near the end of your tour when they usually try to give you relatively safe missions, and there were some tracer bullets that you weren't counting on that were coming at you.

13:44.975 --> 13:49.002
Yeah, we flew a mission around the division base camp.

13:49.353 --> 14:00.618
to drop these large flares that lit up the perimeter for the soldiers that were on guard duty to see if there were enemy coming through the wire, because they wouldn't have any lights or enough electricity.

14:00.738 --> 14:06.130
And we would do that all night long, and I came in about midnight or one o'clock on one mission,

14:06.532 --> 14:07.615
and landed the helicopter.

14:07.655 --> 14:08.877
We hovered into the revetment.

14:08.897 --> 14:10.621
It's an L-shaped revetment, I'll never forget.

14:10.922 --> 14:12.125
It's open on one side.

14:12.466 --> 14:18.279
We hovered in there, and I was on the opposite side that it's open, and all of a sudden, tracers started coming across the nose of the helicopter.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.983
I mean, it was a lot of them.

14:20.003 --> 14:22.549
I don't know how we missed, but I guess he wasn't trying to hit us.

14:22.799 --> 14:30.954
So they went across the helicopter and we all jumped out and started low crawling away from where he was shooting, back away from where we thought was safe.

14:31.015 --> 14:38.649
And so we warned the guys behind us because we had some people coming in behind us that what was going on and not the land.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.314
And what had happened is one of the,

14:41.294 --> 15:04.956
platoon leaders that was behind us had a his member of his platoon was shooting and he was waiting on him to land he was going to shoot him down he had some for some reason he was mad at him I don't remember why but anyway so but they captured him and everybody was safe so we've got some photographs that Mike has provided for us just a few of them to show you there's a there is a young

15:05.223 --> 15:07.867
wide-eyed Mike Sutherland.

15:08.047 --> 15:09.229
About how old were you in this picture?

15:09.249 --> 15:10.451
I was probably 20 there.

15:10.511 --> 15:11.833
I was a private then.

15:12.074 --> 15:13.376
That was when I got drafted.

15:13.396 --> 15:14.157
That was a photo.

15:14.177 --> 15:14.678
That's right.

15:14.698 --> 15:16.040
No ribbons or medals on that guy.

15:16.060 --> 15:20.907
No, that wasn't been after you up all night and so that was the first photo in Normie.

15:20.927 --> 15:29.521
This is a, I put this in here because this is one of our UH-1s and it has that pelican on the front of it because in those days we decorated our helicopters.

15:29.541 --> 15:30.943
That was kind of like in World War II.

15:30.923 --> 15:32.825
Yeah, like the nose art in World War II.

15:32.845 --> 15:33.006
Exactly.

15:33.126 --> 15:35.208
And our call sign was Pelican.

15:35.228 --> 15:39.193
And not only that, but we used the same call signs all the time.

15:39.213 --> 15:45.240
And the Viet Cong finally figured out who we were because we used like Pelican 6 would be the commander.

15:45.541 --> 15:47.904
So they knew exactly who we were because they could listen to the radios.

15:47.924 --> 15:49.405
And we didn't change our call signs.

15:49.426 --> 15:53.510
We didn't start doing that until the latter part of 79 or 70, rather.

15:54.171 --> 15:57.676
And this is a picture of in Vietnam in a helicopter.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.698
I'm the co-pilot there.

15:59.864 --> 16:04.613
That white helmet, you know, we had white helmets when we first started when I was there.

16:04.793 --> 16:06.436
You know, that makes a very good target.

16:06.456 --> 16:07.979
You can't see anything with that white helmet.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.443
So somebody said, you know what, that's a real good target.

16:11.044 --> 16:12.727
Take that off and get a colored one.

16:12.747 --> 16:13.388
So anyway.

16:13.508 --> 16:15.171
Yeah, that's why they invented camera.

16:15.252 --> 16:16.033
It is the same thing.

16:16.053 --> 16:18.377
This was, we all had nicknames.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.222
What's on the back of that helmet is Louisiana Swamper as my company.

16:21.262 --> 16:23.847
That was my nickname in Vietnam.

16:24.822 --> 16:28.567
And we'll talk about this later, but you had a desk job.

16:28.607 --> 16:41.365
Yeah, well, this was when I came back from Vietnam, the Army did the firefighter training for all the services, and I was in charge of the company that did the firefighter training, and that was a helmet that somebody gave me from PIS, Germany, I think it was.

16:41.485 --> 16:41.986
I see.

16:42.006 --> 16:42.907
It was there on the desk.

16:42.927 --> 16:43.548
So where were you?

16:44.049 --> 16:44.970
That was at Fort Rucker.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.312
In Fort Rucker.

16:46.332 --> 16:47.333
I did training at Fort Rucker.

16:47.353 --> 16:49.076
I came back and was assigned to Fort Rucker, Alabama.

16:49.156 --> 16:49.536
Alabama.

16:49.797 --> 16:50.498
Right, exactly.

16:50.798 --> 16:50.998
Right.

16:51.219 --> 16:51.779
Great pictures.

16:52.160 --> 16:52.480
Thank you.

16:52.741 --> 16:54.323
Before we leave Vietnam,

16:54.995 --> 17:07.640
There was an incident that you talked about, I guess this would have been New Year's Eve of 1969, where a fella got a little out of control, had a little bit too much, and it became a very scary incident for you.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.788
Yeah, on New Year's Eve, I happened to have, that would have been,

17:12.359 --> 17:12.800
69.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.362
Right.

17:16.325 --> 17:17.066
Going into 70.

17:17.166 --> 17:17.807
Right, exactly.

17:17.887 --> 17:21.232
And I happen to have officer duty, officer day duty.

17:21.272 --> 17:25.919
Anyway, so they came and got me about midnight when everybody started.

17:25.959 --> 17:30.606
We had lots of colored flares and stuff that the guys would shoot off and tracers and all that stuff.

17:30.626 --> 17:31.788
It really looked like fireworks.

17:31.828 --> 17:33.070
I mean, they shot so many of them.

17:33.631 --> 17:41.623
So they called me from one of the bunker areas that there was a soldier standing behind the bunker line and he was drunk and he was firing

17:41.941 --> 17:46.930
on automatic into the bunker line, where our people were in the bunker's garden area.

17:46.950 --> 17:57.088
And so I went up there to him, and I realized I knew him, so I said, I called his name, and when I called his name, he turned the M16 Omni on automatic.

17:57.588 --> 17:59.251
He didn't shoot it, but he just pointed at me.

18:00.173 --> 18:07.105
And so, you know, I said, we gotta talk about this, you know, because all I had was a .45, and there was no place to run, and it was just, there was no win situation for me, so.

18:07.540 --> 18:10.483
I said, you know, you need to put that down because somebody's going to get hurt.

18:11.004 --> 18:14.147
So I talked to him for a few minutes, and he said, well, you're going to court-martial me.

18:14.168 --> 18:15.889
I said, oh, no.

18:15.909 --> 18:17.812
I think this is one of the few times in my life I lied.

18:17.852 --> 18:19.814
I said, no, not worry about it.

18:19.914 --> 18:21.456
I will take care of it.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.016
So I saw him.

18:22.036 --> 18:25.400
He did put it down, so we got him, handcuffed him and all that stuff.

18:26.241 --> 18:31.487
About a month later, he'd been court-martialed and had to go to jail, and for some reason I saw him.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.792
And he said, you told me that nothing was going to happen to me.

18:36.177 --> 18:39.362
And I said, that's correct, but you had an M16 on me on fully automatic.

18:39.382 --> 18:41.927
And I feel fully justified in telling you that, too.

18:43.309 --> 18:45.212
So neither one of us got killed.

18:45.954 --> 18:46.715
That was fortunate.

18:46.735 --> 18:47.997
12 months in Vietnam.

18:48.017 --> 18:49.800
I came back in February of 1970.

18:50.321 --> 18:53.987
We saw that picture at Fort Rucker, where you went to an engineer battalion there.

18:54.188 --> 18:54.388
Right.

18:54.723 --> 18:58.907
And then the Little Rock, Arkansas, where you were under a Colonel Downs.

18:59.188 --> 18:59.989
That's exactly right.

19:00.329 --> 19:02.511
Ben Downs' uncle, I found out recently.

19:02.531 --> 19:03.072
It's amazing.

19:03.092 --> 19:03.873
It's a small world.

19:04.133 --> 19:15.285
Yeah, I was in the computer job there and I did, in the navigation department, I did, wrote and converted computer programs for the engineering work that they had to do.

19:15.826 --> 19:19.870
And I was in the engineering department and I worked for, I mean, I was in the computer department and I worked for

19:20.086 --> 19:25.193
Colonel Downs, he had me do a study of the computer department on how to be organized.

19:25.213 --> 19:26.915
So I set that up for him before I left there.

19:26.935 --> 19:28.738
And so it was really interesting.

19:28.758 --> 19:29.519
Ben Downs, of course.

19:29.539 --> 19:31.582
I can't imagine anybody doesn't know Ben.

19:31.622 --> 19:36.589
Ben is my boss and general manager of Bryan Broadcasting and WTAW.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.232
And I know that he's very proud of his uncle.

19:39.353 --> 19:39.813
Oh, yes.

19:39.833 --> 19:40.114
Service.

19:40.134 --> 19:42.757
And you all had a chance recently to talk about that.

19:42.777 --> 19:49.366
Germany for four years, where you served as not only a community commander, company commander, but XO for those four years.

19:49.406 --> 19:49.907
That was...

19:50.343 --> 19:51.488
It was an interesting service.

19:51.528 --> 19:52.411
It was cold.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.066
You spent 200 days out on the field to begin with.

19:56.246 --> 20:00.724
That was in the days of the Cold War and what we were doing there is training

20:01.025 --> 20:05.052
to stop the Russians from coming across the German border into West Germany.

20:05.653 --> 20:13.046
And our organization was responsible to go up to the full of the gap and put out as many mines, any tank mines that we could as possible.

20:13.146 --> 20:16.011
We practiced all kinds of ways, putting those mines out.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.894
We threw them out and we did all kinds of things.

20:17.934 --> 20:21.480
And we also were responsible for tank ditches to keep the

20:21.460 --> 20:24.588
If you dig a tank ditch the right size and right place, they couldn't cross it.

20:25.169 --> 20:27.835
And we also had to blow the bridges as we came, as we fell back.

20:28.076 --> 20:33.489
So we put the mines out, dug the tank ditches, and then blew the bridges as we fell back through the area to keep them from coming.

20:33.850 --> 20:36.697
They were going to Frankfurt's where they were going and on to England.

20:37.399 --> 20:38.862
But I found out later

20:38.842 --> 20:57.390
after I retired from army read Reagan's book that in some of the secret conversations they published that that the Russians plan was to nuke that area where we were and drive through but depth so we were then fried you know so I don't know who would have slowed down but anyway that was I'm glad it never happened that's right because we had to get not only that we had to get all of the

20:57.623 --> 21:04.451
We had all of our civilians there, all of our families were there too, so we had the plan to, we were up front, and the families were evacuating from Germany.

21:04.832 --> 21:05.453
Right, right.

21:05.553 --> 21:11.640
You said that when you were there is when Reagan was elected, and they were pretty excited about that because Reagan was pretty tough on the Soviets.

21:11.720 --> 21:11.921
Right.

21:12.061 --> 21:17.948
During the campaign, Reagan was the only candidate that said that we've got to stop the Russians.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.530
We called them the evil empire.

21:19.831 --> 21:28.805
And the Germans at that time in West Germany, they were in a critical position because the only thing that kept them from speaking Russian was that the Chinese was on the other side.

21:28.825 --> 21:33.192
And if the Russians had made a move across the border, it was assumed that the Chinese would come across too.

21:33.212 --> 21:34.955
So that was kind of a blocking force for them.

21:34.975 --> 21:40.624
So I was, at that time I was a community commander or the deputy community commander

21:40.840 --> 21:44.487
And I was meeting with Germans, and when they found out he got elected, they were all cheering.

21:44.507 --> 21:45.610
It was a wonderful thing for him.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.155
And things changed a lot for the Army then, too.

21:48.195 --> 21:51.462
We didn't have a lot of money and didn't have a lot of assets, and he changed it around.

21:51.482 --> 21:53.145
He pumped a lot of money into the Army system.

21:53.463 --> 21:58.970
From Germany to back to the stateside, Fort Leavenworth in 1981, what was your degree to do?

21:59.150 --> 22:01.093
And there I was doing research and development.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.237
My systems were chemical and nuclear systems.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.458
And I worked for Colin Powell there.

22:05.478 --> 22:06.179
He was my boss.

22:06.340 --> 22:06.540
Really?

22:06.560 --> 22:07.681
My one boss up.

22:07.701 --> 22:08.983
And I had to brief him quite a bit.

22:09.003 --> 22:09.664
He was a great guy.

22:09.684 --> 22:12.027
But anyway, we worked on some of the systems.

22:12.047 --> 22:16.753
That was in 81, and they used some of those systems that we were working on in

22:17.307 --> 22:22.053
testing in the early 90s in the Desert Storm Desert Shield.

22:22.173 --> 22:24.416
Some of the engineering system and the chemical both.

22:24.436 --> 22:25.578
Right, so as early as 81.

22:25.778 --> 22:30.444
It takes that long, the research, the development of it and all of that.

22:31.105 --> 22:33.568
And finally, to a place called Bryan, Texas in 1984.

22:34.750 --> 22:39.736
And you were sort of on the giving end of what you had been of the receiving end in Germany.

22:39.877 --> 22:40.958
Your duty at the 480th.

22:41.339 --> 22:46.285
Yeah, as we discussed, the Germany

22:46.720 --> 22:59.917
and the defense of Germany for the Russians was that once the Russians attacked, the reserve units would be deployed to Germany, called Reforger, and they would assist us in blocking the Russians.

22:59.937 --> 23:01.779
Well, and the 420th was one of those units.

23:01.819 --> 23:09.108
They were tasked with being those Reforger units to deploy to Germany, so I helped them, I worked in that area.

23:09.669 --> 23:14.415
We primarily worked on training and getting them up to speed on the current systems in their army,

23:14.935 --> 23:17.139
how to fight, but now it's a lot tougher on them.

23:17.159 --> 23:20.464
They have to go every 18 months or so to Iraq, Afghanistan.

23:21.146 --> 23:27.817
You mentioned that you served under Al Jones, the former Brazos County judge, and of course he had a distinguished military career.

23:27.917 --> 23:31.503
What do you remember of General Jones back then?

23:31.523 --> 23:39.036
Well, he was the commander when I came in, so he was my, like,

23:39.674 --> 23:41.637
door to the civilian world too.

23:41.657 --> 23:45.983
I'd been on the post for 17 years, and we'd been strictly in the military for 70 years.

23:46.223 --> 23:50.730
Really, the civilian world was not, at that time, not really something I was familiar with.

23:50.770 --> 23:57.840
So he kind of got me accustomed, and I'll never forget, the first thing he took me to was a bonfire.

23:57.860 --> 24:03.808
So we stood out there in the middle of the field, and I didn't know anything about Aggies, and stood out in the middle of that field, and it was muddy.

24:04.345 --> 24:06.210
and we watched that outhouse burn and fall.

24:06.732 --> 24:13.591
And I said, sir, you know, if you drive 50 miles from here and told somebody tomorrow that you stood out here at midnight and watched the outhouse burn, they'll think you're crazy.

24:14.293 --> 24:17.663
But I had no idea how widespread that was.

24:18.352 --> 24:25.125
So then in 1984, it was, well, 89, excuse me.

24:25.145 --> 24:26.708
84 is when you came to Bryant.

24:26.909 --> 24:31.117
In 89, it was time to move again, but you had a family that didn't want to move.

24:31.157 --> 24:33.682
Your wife, Tana, was going to school at the time.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.724
You had kids in school.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.866
They wanted to stay.

24:36.207 --> 24:36.327
Right.

24:36.610 --> 24:37.992
It was time to retire from the service.

24:38.012 --> 24:40.035
Yes, there was no good combination we could make.

24:40.255 --> 24:47.645
I didn't want to leave her here by herself with three teenage boys, and we didn't want to leave one by herself as a senior, a Mrs. Senior in high school and all that.

24:47.685 --> 24:52.712
So we just had a family meeting and came to the conclusion it was time for me to do something and not them.

24:52.772 --> 24:58.981
So I retired, and at that time, it was tough because the economy was pretty bad in 89.

24:59.121 --> 25:00.423
It was really bad.

25:00.563 --> 25:02.145
But anyway, we made the best of it.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.189
Whatever it took to do the job, we did it.

25:04.229 --> 25:05.456
Went into the insurance business?

25:05.496 --> 25:05.818
Correct.

25:05.838 --> 25:10.684
Stayed there for 20 years and just sold my last agency and maybe that'll be the last one.

25:11.137 --> 25:16.622
Of course, your service on the Bryan City Council, I know that that's something you love, plus your volunteer things that you do.

25:16.642 --> 25:19.524
But we talked a little bit about city council.

25:19.665 --> 25:31.275
Certainly don't want to turn this into a forum of any kind, but just sort of talk about how the military training helps you as you sit and serve the people of Bryan on the council.

25:31.555 --> 25:33.237
There's obviously, that goes hand in hand.

25:33.257 --> 25:34.498
Yeah, thank you for bringing that up.

25:34.618 --> 25:39.422
The military, although we were steeped in combat and combat procedures,

25:40.043 --> 25:46.341
What makes the military run is staffing and staff actions and doing your homework and making sure that

25:46.692 --> 25:54.760
that you've got the details figured out and that they're all laid out on the table so that the commander, the guy making the decisions, can make the right decision.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.884
Not the decision you want, but the one that's produced by the evidence that's presented.

25:59.145 --> 26:01.147
And that's the same thing with our city operation.

26:01.467 --> 26:07.733
We have to know all the details of what's going on, but in this case, it takes four of us to make a decision, but it's still the same process.

26:08.114 --> 26:12.598
Staff has to be in good, they have to be good, they have to be able to articulate, and they have to do their homework.

26:12.578 --> 26:14.390
And I enjoy that part of it.

26:14.431 --> 26:19.062
I enjoy helping the citizens when they need assistance and that really keeps me motivated.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.593
So staff probably knows that they're working for a military guy.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.956
Well, I don't mind asking questions.

26:23.976 --> 26:24.756
Let's say that.

26:26.038 --> 26:26.919
That's great.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.561
We mentioned your volunteer work.

26:28.581 --> 26:29.782
We've got about a minute left.

26:29.802 --> 26:39.193
And I know one thing that you're very involved in is helping head up the Veterans Day Parade that we have in downtown Bryan every year, which is just a fantastic event.

26:39.213 --> 26:41.056
And that's sort of a labor of love.

26:41.116 --> 26:42.097
It's an overused term, right?

26:42.117 --> 26:42.357
Absolutely.

26:42.377 --> 26:43.478
We just did our eighth one.

26:43.498 --> 26:46.602
And that involved from the Rotary Club.

26:47.459 --> 26:54.569
some programs and people wanted to do more than just programs at the Rotary Club, so the Rotary Club agreed to do that.

26:54.609 --> 26:59.617
And we've had as many as 2,000 people watching and about 500 or 600 people in the parade.

26:59.637 --> 27:06.126
It's not large because I want to keep it under control and make sure nobody gets hurt.

27:06.106 --> 27:07.969
And it's for the soldiers.

27:08.009 --> 27:11.394
It's not for the governor to be here or some politician to be here.

27:11.735 --> 27:13.678
We honor the veterans of our area.

27:13.698 --> 27:14.559
That's what it's all about.

27:14.839 --> 27:15.620
Mike, we're out of time.

27:15.881 --> 27:20.548
Thank you very much for your service and thanks for everything that you're doing for the city and your volunteer work.

27:20.568 --> 27:21.469
We appreciate you being here.

27:21.529 --> 27:22.411
Well, thank you for doing this.

27:22.451 --> 27:23.813
I really appreciate it very much.

27:24.394 --> 27:35.050
Mike Sutherland now serves his community, not only as a council member, but has volunteered with such organizations as Boys and Girls Club, Elder Aid, BB Casa, MAD, and the Red Cross.

27:35.333 --> 27:38.963
He and his wife, Tana, have three children and are proud grandparents.

27:39.304 --> 27:42.011
We thank him and all veterans for their service.

27:42.031 --> 27:42.974
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.360
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:13.471 --> 28:14.420
Thank you.
