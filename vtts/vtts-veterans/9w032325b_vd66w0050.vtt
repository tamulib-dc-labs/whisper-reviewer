00:13.025 --> 00:31.694
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.714 --> 00:32.856
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.342 --> 00:56.886
you can tell by just spending a few minutes with jim robbins that he is quite proud of his 38 years of military service to our country and we all should be a veteran helicopter pilot of the vietnam war later in el salvador and operation desert storm his federal service included mostly army duty but he also had marine basic training he worked for the navy the faa and did service in the national guard

00:56.866 --> 01:05.025
But perhaps his most compelling story is how his life changed in 1998, three years after he retired from military service.

01:05.346 --> 01:08.573
Please welcome Brian's Jim Robbins to Veterans of the Valley.

01:08.593 --> 01:10.036
It's an honor to have you here, Jim.

01:10.076 --> 01:12.382
Let's talk about sort of how you got into the service.

01:12.402 --> 01:13.845
You grew up in Corpus Christi.

01:13.825 --> 01:17.690
Your service actually ended at the Naval Air Base there, so you started and ended there.

01:17.791 --> 01:25.982
In between, you said you graduated from Corpus Christi Ray, May 27th of 1957, and a week later, you were already in basic training.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.826
So it was sort of a fast track from high school to the military.

01:29.127 --> 01:30.128
Talk a little bit about that.

01:31.090 --> 01:31.190
Yeah.

01:31.210 --> 01:43.427
Well, I woke up and was in San Diego, and like all young people, you know, felt that I was a little bit out of my league, but quickly fell in a step because we had DIs that weren't going to leave us behind.

01:43.745 --> 02:09.634
and finished up basic training that summer and came back home went back to school at A&I there in Kingsville and tried it for a year or so and my roommate and I decided that we wanted to go in the military and my family had always been aviation so I went to the Marine Corps and asked them what my chances were to go aviation in the Marine Corps and they said slim to none so I said okay

02:10.120 --> 02:16.566
And David, my roommate and I, we went and visited the Army recruiter and the Army said, well, come with us.

02:16.606 --> 02:19.569
We'll guarantee you aviation, but not right off the bat.

02:19.589 --> 02:22.112
You have to spend some time in another branch.

02:22.172 --> 02:36.545
So I ended up in the artillery and spent the first two years of my Army career in Germany and came back and ended up going to Biloxi, Mississippi to air traffic controller school.

02:36.966 --> 02:38.187
And that's where I,

02:38.656 --> 02:59.790
I spent my time as an air traffic controller in the Army for the first nine years of my military career with the Army and was in Korea when President Kennedy was shot and then came back home and my next door neighbor at Fort Hood was the warrant officer and he taught me in going to flight school.

02:59.810 --> 03:04.157
And then in January of 1967,

03:04.762 --> 03:07.747
I entered flight school up at Fort Walters, Texas.

03:07.767 --> 03:13.817
It was cold and pre-flight was something that I'd never experienced before.

03:13.897 --> 03:16.381
It was worse than basic training in the Marine Corps.

03:17.062 --> 03:25.335
But we made it through that and late in 67 we graduated, got our bars and got our wings.

03:26.024 --> 03:28.187
then I was off to Vietnam.

03:28.447 --> 03:35.097
In the country and spent just about all of 68 there, early part of 69 as a flyer, flying both Hueys and Loaches.

03:35.177 --> 03:36.999
Talk about your time in Vietnam.

03:37.019 --> 03:40.104
I know you started off flying Medevac, 15th Med.

03:40.724 --> 03:46.152
Talk about that and then sort of what you went on to, sort of your year in Vietnam.

03:46.172 --> 03:46.553
Go ahead.

03:48.215 --> 03:55.525
Well, when I got there in 68, the first cavalry division was my unit, and they were split up in several different directions.

03:56.078 --> 04:00.311
some up in I-Corps and then some up over in II-Corps.

04:00.913 --> 04:09.700
That's where our main area operation was around on K. And little known to me,

04:09.916 --> 04:18.384
By being assigned the 15th Med Battalion, I was being flight checked to see if I could fly for brigade commanders.

04:18.704 --> 04:24.289
They were needing Charlie Charlie pilots, which stands for communication and control pilots.

04:24.309 --> 04:33.637
And so I got to flying with the check pilot for 15th Med and got to flying a lot of instrument at that time because we were in the monsoon season.

04:34.358 --> 04:37.881
And so I flew with them for a couple of months, did a couple of missions.

04:38.300 --> 05:05.657
in the jungle and then I ended up being transferred to 2nd Brigade Aviation which was at a little LZ called LZ Uplift which was south of Bongsong over on the North China Sea and so that's where I started flying regularly with 2nd Battalion flying Charlie Charlie and then we started flying a little bit of scouts and that was just to support that small AO that I was in and

05:05.873 --> 05:08.336
That was my first taste of combat.

05:08.937 --> 05:16.348
We were supported first of the 50th mechanized, second of the 12th, and several of the battalions that were assigned to that brigade.

05:17.109 --> 05:27.443
And we were holding the AO down as most of the division was moving north to I-Corps up in the Kaysan, Fubai area, Wayfubai area.

05:27.862 --> 05:32.987
And we happened to be in the uplift area when the Tet Offensive kicked off in 68.

05:34.148 --> 05:36.110
And we worked.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.231
We earned our keep.

05:37.251 --> 05:53.168
And then we moved forward after the Tet Offensive and joined the rest of the division up at a LZ called LZ Evans up in the I Corps, which was in support of the Marine Corps at Kason.

05:53.188 --> 05:55.590
And that's where I got the transition into

05:56.043 --> 06:24.160
into Loaches, OH-6s, and started flying scouts in the OH-6s, and then the division commo officer found out that I was a prior service in an air traffic controller to boot, and he needed somebody to start looking after his air traffic controllers, which was spread out all over the division area, which was four LZs in one division instrumented airport, which is LZ Evans, and my job at that point then was to

06:24.595 --> 06:50.485
not only support the air traffic controllers but we also had a platoon of of pathfinders which we call black hats and the pathfinders go in ahead of lift companies to make sure that where the LZs were hot and what the wind was what the conditions were on the LZ and they just guided the lifts in they were the first one in last ones out right LZ of course landing zone just for people to

06:50.836 --> 06:53.019
know the jargon and all of that.

06:53.900 --> 07:05.316
So your job was really to keep track of that everybody had what they needed, supplies, tents, move people around, move personnel around.

07:05.456 --> 07:06.858
Yes, pay them.

07:06.878 --> 07:07.839
Yeah, delivered paychecks.

07:07.859 --> 07:09.461
So they like to see you coming.

07:09.481 --> 07:10.022
Right.

07:10.042 --> 07:10.283
Yeah.

07:11.484 --> 07:13.587
You were always there.

07:14.427 --> 07:21.835
In the middle of 1968, you were in the Kaysan Valley and then the Aishaw Valley around that area.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.938
Talk a little bit more about your job in the last six months.

07:24.919 --> 07:25.499
Last six months?

07:25.519 --> 07:26.801
Of your tour.

07:27.061 --> 07:30.525
That was supporting the air traffic controls of the division.

07:31.126 --> 07:43.860
And that consisted of everything from hauling generators to tinnage to hauling POWs sometimes to even hauling KIAs.

07:44.718 --> 07:45.861
I would move in the morning.

07:45.941 --> 07:56.406
Usually I'd leave on Monday morning and I would either go up to Da Nang and then move as far north as Quang Tree, sometimes as far north as the Rock Pile, which was north of Dong Ha.

07:57.047 --> 08:01.478
And I'd just get airborne, make sure that I was in contact with the division.

08:01.458 --> 08:06.103
talk, which was division communication section and let them know who I was.

08:06.143 --> 08:08.185
My call sign, they knew what it was.

08:08.305 --> 08:10.488
My air traffic controllers knew what my call sign was.

08:10.848 --> 08:12.450
So if they needed something, they just call me.

08:12.850 --> 08:17.195
I had a certain frequency that I could come up on and I would keep that tuned so they could get in touch with me.

08:17.235 --> 08:23.341
And I just moved from one LZ to the next, making sure everybody was supplied with what they needed.

08:23.381 --> 08:28.967
And then when I got through at the end of the week, I'd come back home and take a break or so and then start all over again.

08:29.369 --> 08:36.886
I've never talked to a Vietnam veteran who didn't certainly have certain parts of their service that it was difficult to talk about, obviously emotional to talk about.

08:36.946 --> 08:46.467
Part of war is survival, and I know that there were times that you referred to flying around the rock piles, that there were times that

08:46.818 --> 08:49.802
that you had to do things that are hard to talk about.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.845
Yes, yes.

08:53.927 --> 08:55.789
We went low level a lot.

08:55.809 --> 09:03.699
And a lot of times when you go low level around villages, the kids would try to throw rocks up through their older blades.

09:03.719 --> 09:11.068
And there are just a lot of things that happened that I brought home a lot of heavy baggage with.

09:11.128 --> 09:14.192
And if you remember, there were

09:15.202 --> 09:19.588
There were instances like the Mylai Valley, the Mylai Rat Massacre.

09:19.689 --> 09:26.999
And so there was lots of things that were going on that you would see and be a witness to that just kind of hangs with you.

09:27.260 --> 09:27.861
Indeed.

09:27.881 --> 09:30.304
And it just never goes away.

09:31.646 --> 09:33.529
We'll talk about that later and how you dealt with that.

09:33.850 --> 09:36.393
We referred to that in the opening in 1998.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.256
But...

09:39.333 --> 09:45.308
I visited with you earlier about fear of capture and your fear in this job.

09:45.348 --> 09:49.017
I mean, you were a chopper pilot in Vietnam in a very ugly, ugly war.

09:49.879 --> 09:50.782
What was your fear level?

09:50.822 --> 09:54.591
Were you afraid or did you just have a job to do or did you have time to be afraid?

09:56.225 --> 10:00.330
Well, they have a certain name for guys when they first come in country.

10:00.370 --> 10:05.116
And those who have ever been in country, they'll understand what I'm saying.

10:05.156 --> 10:07.859
But let's just say that they call them newbies.

10:08.300 --> 10:14.347
And so my check pilot when I first got in country, he sent me down one day.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.690
He said, look, you're going to go through stages.

10:16.710 --> 10:22.317
And one of the first stages you're going to have is you're going to the first couple of months, you're going to feel sorry for yourself for being here.

10:23.090 --> 10:30.737
But if you'll just take it on, and he knew that I played football, but if you'll just take it on like playing a football game, if you think you're going to get hurt, you're going to get hurt.

10:31.017 --> 10:40.546
But if you go out there and play rock'em, sock'em, heads-up football, and just try to slap some leather, you're not going to get hurt.

10:41.226 --> 10:42.688
It worked for me, it'll work for you.

10:42.848 --> 10:46.591
So I took that on as good advice, and that's what I did.

10:46.952 --> 10:52.877
And the last part of the tour is you're always wondering whether or not this one has got

10:53.195 --> 10:54.677
your name on it or not.

10:54.697 --> 11:01.003
And once you've ever heard the snap, you think, well, that one was to whom it was concerned.

11:01.063 --> 11:01.864
It wasn't to me.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.248
So that's the way you play the game.

11:05.268 --> 11:10.834
And as far as helicopter pilots in our AL, and especially at First Cav, we were pretty well known.

11:11.214 --> 11:19.303
And anybody that went down and didn't get help quickly usually were found with common wire

11:19.688 --> 11:21.610
hands tied behind them and a bullet in the back of the head.

11:21.650 --> 11:24.174
So we all had generally personal weapons.

11:24.234 --> 11:34.687
I had a 38 Derringer and my insurance was that it was a two shot Derringer and one shot for him and one shot for me in that order.

11:35.248 --> 11:37.631
And so after a while, you just don't think about it.

11:37.651 --> 11:42.176
You just do your job and you have your short timers calendar and you mark the days off.

11:42.517 --> 11:42.917
Right.

11:42.937 --> 11:46.922
And then you work and you live for the guy that's in the left seat with you.

11:47.383 --> 11:47.603
Right.

11:48.190 --> 11:55.600
You had the Derringer, the idea being that you were going to take control, not have someone else take control if it came to that.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.041
Absolutely.

11:56.121 --> 12:00.367
You were one of the fortunate ones that returned, and for that, you're very grateful.

12:00.567 --> 12:00.988
I know that.

12:01.549 --> 12:02.710
I want to go ahead and talk.

12:03.191 --> 12:04.813
Let's go ahead and go to some photographs right now.

12:04.853 --> 12:13.185
As a matter of fact, these are photographs that you have in your special office, in your home, that sort of chronicles your story.

12:13.672 --> 12:14.514
your service.

12:15.195 --> 12:19.484
Here's the first one, and these are a couple of pictures, a young man and a man about 10 years old.

12:19.524 --> 12:21.107
These are 10 years apart.

12:21.187 --> 12:23.251
On the left, when was that picture taken?

12:23.332 --> 12:27.680
That was taken in 1957 after I finished basic training in the Marine Corps.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.925
So just pretty much fresh out of high school.

12:30.025 --> 12:35.376
Yes, and the one on the right is when I finished flight school in 1967.

12:37.533 --> 12:38.394
Hadn't aged too much.

12:38.634 --> 12:38.814
No.

12:39.115 --> 12:40.556
Good looking soldier.

12:40.777 --> 12:41.377
Still got hair.

12:41.477 --> 12:42.318
Still got hair there.

12:42.398 --> 12:44.301
That was in 1967.

12:44.341 --> 12:47.104
That was in LZ Evans or LZ Jane.

12:47.124 --> 12:48.085
I'm sorry.

12:48.105 --> 12:51.409
That was one of the Charlie Charlie aircraft in the background.

12:51.989 --> 12:59.217
We either stopped for lunch or I'm not sure what I'm doing there, but that's at LZ Evans.

12:59.598 --> 12:59.938
I don't know.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.220
You can barely see the Derringer.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.422
That's one of the loaches I flew.

13:03.925 --> 13:06.488
It's got an XM-21 system on the side of it.

13:06.508 --> 13:08.872
It's a minigun on the left there.

13:08.892 --> 13:09.472
You can see it.

13:10.293 --> 13:11.936
And we flew with the doors off.

13:12.016 --> 13:16.462
And I usually had an observer in the back seat on the right-hand side.

13:16.522 --> 13:20.347
And a lot of times we just fly low level and spread the elephant grass.

13:20.427 --> 13:26.835
And if we saw a hole or spider hole where Charlie dug a hole in and he would drop a smoke grenade in.

13:26.855 --> 13:33.544
And then we'd move out of the way and a cobra would come in and lay down some rockets down or some...

13:34.739 --> 13:36.842
grenades or whatever we could do.

13:37.602 --> 13:38.544
We'd take grenades with us.

13:39.325 --> 13:43.089
We'd just go out looking for trouble whenever we were flying with 1st to the 9th.

13:43.369 --> 13:57.367
I usually flew the Brigade Commanders or Battalion Commanders Loach which was 1st to the 9th Battalion Commander and we shared an aircraft and that was one of his aircraft right there.

13:57.867 --> 14:02.693
And then I used that aircraft when he wasn't flying it to support the air traffic controllers.

14:02.813 --> 14:04.375
We all lived on the same LZ.

14:04.692 --> 14:12.962
LZ Evans, which happened to be the division instrumented airport, which was just south of Weifubai.

14:13.223 --> 14:15.726
That's a depiction of a couple of aircrafts.

14:15.746 --> 14:23.275
Yeah, that's a Huey in the back behind the Chinook, and this is a B model or a C model Chinook.

14:24.076 --> 14:29.143
And when I started flying the Chinooks in the 80s, I fell in love with flying all over again.

14:29.363 --> 14:31.366
Just a beautiful aircraft.

14:31.386 --> 14:33.248
It lifts 50,000 pounds.

14:33.768 --> 14:37.875
And it can carry 33 troops in the back.

14:37.895 --> 14:43.704
And it's just a pleasure to be either in the clouds with or low-level cross-country.

14:43.784 --> 14:53.020
It's just, you can tell now that they're using it very, very effectively in Afghanistan because it will take the high altitudes.

14:53.040 --> 14:53.360
Indeed.

14:54.222 --> 14:55.584
That's a lot of aircraft right there.

14:55.704 --> 14:56.065
It is.

14:56.545 --> 14:57.707
But it is fun to fly.

14:58.088 --> 14:58.729
I'll bet it is.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.931
Talk about this, you're receiving a commendation.

15:01.951 --> 15:02.291
Yes, sir.

15:02.412 --> 15:07.878
This is one of our brigade, this is our brigade commander at LZ Uplift in 67.

15:08.078 --> 15:20.672
I think that's where I got the air metal with V. During a little operation we had about a month and a half after I was in country.

15:21.152 --> 15:25.577
We had made contact about two or three miles south of where we lived.

15:26.063 --> 15:36.594
That day I remember it was kind of raining and the guys standing to my right, we all were involved in a rescue from one of our helicopters that went down.

15:37.094 --> 15:44.102
And Mr. Little got injured pretty badly, had to get shipped back to the States.

15:45.964 --> 15:50.849
But there's my partner during Desert Storm, Jim Myrick.

15:50.949 --> 15:55.834
We had just returned from Saudi Arabia and we work for the Army Safety Center.

15:56.152 --> 15:57.434
as accident investigators.

15:58.235 --> 16:17.518
Both of us were aviation safety officers and we were in Saudi Arabia to do accident investigations on mainly the OH-58s that were having difficulty with the climate and the sand and so we were assigned to

16:17.583 --> 16:34.421
as a team to go out in the desert and investigate the accident sites, either take statements from the witnesses or take site pictures and map and then try to run down the cause of the accident.

16:34.461 --> 16:39.406
If there was a fatality, we definitely have to take pictures of the site.

16:39.426 --> 16:41.008
But we're glad to be home.

16:41.663 --> 16:46.350
A shadow box of some of your awards, lots of air medals there.

16:46.751 --> 16:48.073
What are some of the other things we're looking at?

16:48.433 --> 16:55.104
Well, on the right-hand side at the top is my ability to use a rifle and a pistol in the Army.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.325
That's an expert.

16:56.906 --> 17:02.575
Right below that is a sharpshooter, what I received when I was in the Army.

17:03.263 --> 17:07.068
The bottom row is the rank in the Warrant Officer Corps.

17:07.108 --> 17:11.293
You know, it's said in the Navy that the Chiefs run the Navy.

17:11.473 --> 17:17.921
Well, Chiefs have a lot to do with running the Army, too, and Warrant Officers are called Chiefs in the Army.

17:17.941 --> 17:23.028
So those are the early ranks of the Warrant Officer Corps in the Army.

17:23.048 --> 17:31.178
It goes from W-1 through W-4, and then the last one there with the four bars, that's the current W-4 rank, and that's what our retired is.

17:31.833 --> 17:57.756
And the medals, my aviation wings at the top, and the medals are the Bronze Star with V, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal with V, and 13 Oakleaf Clusters, which is 13 Air Medals, and then Army Accommodation, I've got a couple of those, and then Army Good Combat Medal, and a bunch of other ones that have to do with Desert Storm in Vietnam.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.795
All well deserved.

17:59.815 --> 18:07.093
You came home from Vietnam in 1969, I believe it was, and sort of take us from there.

18:07.434 --> 18:11.203
There wasn't a lot of flying to do because most of the choppers were in Vietnam.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.927
You did a little bit of ferrying duty.

18:13.328 --> 18:19.494
You left the Army, you went to work for the FAA, and eventually Desert Storm came along.

18:19.514 --> 18:25.760
I want to go ahead and fast forward to that because after Desert Storm came along, your first duty was actually in El Salvador.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.062
Is that right?

18:27.082 --> 18:27.302
Yes.

18:27.542 --> 18:28.683
Talk about that duty.

18:28.703 --> 18:30.905
That was an interesting duty where you flew there also.

18:31.005 --> 18:31.226
Yeah.

18:31.906 --> 18:37.212
Well, I was working for the Navy as an air traffic controller, and my boss came and got me one day.

18:37.232 --> 18:38.273
He said, there's a guy on the phone.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.174
He wants to talk to you.

18:39.194 --> 18:40.635
And I said, hmm, okay.

18:40.615 --> 18:59.502
So anyway, I ended up back on active duty and working for the Army Safety Center and the beeper went off my first time to go be deployed as an accident investigator to El Salvador and that was back when the Contra were pretty busy and the Salvadoran Army and

18:59.988 --> 19:23.565
the American army who was there from Honduras were flying the same type of aircraft and so the Contras were shooting down anything that looked like Salvadoran so we lost three or four aircraft to their fire and we had gone down there to investigate one particular aircraft that had gone down into a lake which was a dormant lake and it was a volcano which had

19:23.883 --> 19:26.807
turned into a dormant volcano, which turned into a lake.

19:27.348 --> 19:32.236
It was just south of Ilopongo Air Force Base, right side of San Salvador.

19:33.137 --> 19:42.150
And it was sitting in 230 feet of water, and so we went down there to try to get the air crew and the aircraft up, since it all was still together.

19:42.170 --> 19:45.175
And we brought in the Navy, and there was a team of five of us.

19:45.876 --> 19:47.899
And we, of course, had to, again,

19:48.132 --> 20:07.862
map the area and take pictures of it and determine why the aircraft went in and that went on as an investigation for some time even after I left the Army but that was our job and my job is being an air traffic controller and my MOS was 154 Bravo Alpha Bravo which was a Chinook pilot

20:08.551 --> 20:11.594
air traffic technician and aviation safety officer.

20:11.634 --> 20:25.407
So one of my jobs as a part of the team was to talk to the air traffic controllers in the control tower and get a transcript of what was last said and also to determine what the weather was at that time.

20:25.427 --> 20:37.478
And then my job was to make sure that all the information was put together and compiled as a part of the investigation.

20:39.145 --> 20:43.764
Why the aircraft went down, I don't think it was because of air traffic control.

20:44.427 --> 20:49.206
And then the next thing my job was is to go fly with the air crews because

20:49.692 --> 21:06.096
the fact that we were losing air crews and that there was intel to tell that the Salvadoran Contras were in possession of SAM-6s, which were not a good thing for our air crews to have confidence in.

21:06.116 --> 21:15.791
So it was my job to go build some confidence with them and go fly them, because we were in direct support of our special forces that were in the country who were training the Salvadoran Army.

21:15.911 --> 21:18.855
So my job was to go fly with the young crews.

21:19.173 --> 21:26.113
At that time I was 52 years old and so I crawled into an aircraft strapped on a chicken plate and we went flying.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.761
And as a result of that I like to think that

21:29.230 --> 21:33.615
I stemmed some more motivation, so to speak.

21:33.796 --> 21:34.456
Indeed.

21:34.476 --> 21:38.722
Eventually the Desert Storm, still flying Chinooks, safety officer.

21:38.742 --> 21:38.982
Yes.

21:39.022 --> 21:41.485
Talk about your job in deserts in Saudi Arabia.

21:41.505 --> 21:56.183
Saudi Arabia, like I said, Jim Mark and I, our main job was to go fly, go be with the accident investigation team whenever there was an OH-58 that went down, or a lot of times we would investigate

21:56.686 --> 22:02.292
tank accidents, the M1 Abrams, but mainly when an OH-58 went down.

22:02.312 --> 22:19.572
There were times when I went and flew with some of the Chinook crews, my old unit from Dallas, and a lot of times when a safety center comes on board and they see us in the mess hall and walking around the different areas, they have a little apprehension about that because they're in

22:19.838 --> 22:25.704
sometimes thinking that we're there to investigate them for some reason or to inspect them.

22:25.764 --> 22:31.109
And so my job then was to just go and assure them that we weren't there to create any problems.

22:31.129 --> 22:33.632
We were there just to support them, and so that was my job.

22:33.652 --> 22:40.779
So I went flying with my old 136 transportation company, and it was good to be with the guys again.

22:40.799 --> 22:42.460
Again, you were no spring chicken at this time.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.422
You were 52 years old, right?

22:44.542 --> 22:45.183
Yeah, I was.

22:45.944 --> 22:47.065
You had done a lot of flying.

22:47.285 --> 22:49.087
You were in Saudi Arabia about three months, right?

22:49.107 --> 22:49.187
Yes.

22:49.640 --> 22:57.131
He eventually came home, came back to Corpus, went to work back for the Navy again, safety officer for S&S Battalion there.

22:57.832 --> 23:00.656
And couldn't be an air traffic controller anymore.

23:00.676 --> 23:09.989
You had developed some health problems and eventually retired from the Army in 94 and a year later from federal service, 38 years total in federal service.

23:10.149 --> 23:11.772
Just outstanding.

23:11.792 --> 23:14.095
1998.

23:14.648 --> 23:16.030
You went back to Vietnam.

23:16.050 --> 23:16.250
Yes.

23:16.511 --> 23:20.476
Talk about why and what happened to your life after that.

23:21.037 --> 23:40.805
Yeah, well, there was a... We all have stumbling blocks in our life, and I'd had a stumbling block in 97, and a friend of mine suggested that, well, maybe a part of that stumbling block was some baggage that I carried home with me from Vietnam, and not even given it a thought at that point.

23:41.085 --> 23:41.466
And...

23:41.918 --> 23:48.548
He had told me that he had gone back and it had been the best thing that he had done because he was able to leave that baggage behind.

23:49.309 --> 23:51.051
And then I was able to do that.

23:51.172 --> 23:57.741
And I went back with a mission team, a medical mission team, and we ended up in a place called the Lot.

23:58.082 --> 24:09.358
And out in the jungle in a retreat area that looked like a VC base camp, places I used to burn down and go hunt for.

24:09.619 --> 24:11.301
And it was at a...

24:11.872 --> 24:19.244
a campfire one night that the Lord just laid on me to leave it there.

24:19.264 --> 24:20.085
And so I did.

24:21.007 --> 24:24.633
And on the way home, I just dedicated the rest of my life to the Lord.

24:24.653 --> 24:26.536
And that's exactly what I've done.

24:26.616 --> 24:29.220
Since then, I've become a hospital chaplain.

24:29.260 --> 24:34.989
And I've done the best that I could with my life up until the last couple of years.

24:35.049 --> 24:38.655
And I've developed ongoing medical problems that's kind of put

24:39.125 --> 24:49.422
a restriction on that, but I'm still helping as much as I can, either with the American Legion or with whoever needs my help.

24:49.442 --> 25:05.588
I want to back up a little bit because, like I said, when you came back from this mission trip in Vietnam, you got a call from a friend about a week-long course near Waco to sort of prepare you to be a chaplain or to be certified.

25:06.007 --> 25:07.628
And it wasn't as easy as that.

25:07.689 --> 25:14.295
You had to go back to Corpus Christi and actually took a three-year course there at Howard Payne College.

25:14.355 --> 25:17.517
But eventually you were certified as a chaplain.

25:17.537 --> 25:22.962
And that's one of the things you did when you got to Bryan College Station three years ago.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.925
Sort of talk about that job because you worked over at St.

25:25.945 --> 25:27.867
Joseph Hospital for Don Breland.

25:27.887 --> 25:28.768
Yes.

25:30.589 --> 25:34.633
I did my internship at Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi.

25:34.693 --> 25:35.794
And then after that, I worked.

25:36.365 --> 26:05.494
at the Bay Area Hospital in Corpus for several years and we moved up here and when I got up here I talked with Don and he asked me to come over and help with him on a volunteer basis and so that's exactly what I did and I hope to think that I was useful for him and I still go back and help from time to time but I still have some physical problems that prevents me to be there more than what I'd like to be but yes sir I've

26:06.267 --> 26:08.049
It was a blessing to be with Don.

26:08.570 --> 26:09.491
He's one of my heroes.

26:10.773 --> 26:29.860
When you look back at the whole thing, when you graduated from Ray High School and your service in Vietnam and then your service later in El Salvador and Desert Storm and then sort of how your life changed some 11 years ago, when you take a look at all of it, how does it all sum up in Jim Robin's mind?

26:29.880 --> 26:30.280
Amazing.

26:31.222 --> 26:35.127
Amazing that I'm that blessed that I could be

26:35.984 --> 26:38.026
that fortunate to be able to do that.

26:38.046 --> 26:40.529
And it's just, it's really, truly amazing.

26:41.250 --> 26:49.120
And that God has provided so much and has stepped in so many times to interfere on my behalf.

26:49.500 --> 26:54.566
And it's just so obvious to me now, those times when I wasn't aware that now I am.

26:54.907 --> 26:55.167
Right.

26:55.608 --> 26:59.512
And it's just truly amazing.

26:59.773 --> 27:00.774
Right.

27:00.794 --> 27:04.118
If somebody called you today and said, if you could do it,

27:04.688 --> 27:07.671
if you could be a chopper pilot again and do some work, would you go?

27:07.691 --> 27:10.593
It seemed like you loved to fly and you still got it in your blood.

27:10.613 --> 27:10.693
Yes.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.855
If you could, you would, right?

27:11.875 --> 27:12.775
Yeah, you betcha.

27:13.776 --> 27:16.719
I'm on the airport advisory committee for Bryan College Station.

27:17.019 --> 27:19.161
I mean, for Bryan at Coulter Field.

27:19.181 --> 27:22.664
So I've still got my hand in aviation in some way, especially aviation safety.

27:22.704 --> 27:24.266
So I'm still working at it.

27:24.626 --> 27:25.787
Indeed.

27:25.807 --> 27:28.029
And congratulations on doing that.

27:28.069 --> 27:29.170
And thank you for your service.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.112
It's a remarkable story.

27:31.132 --> 27:34.375
Not only your service while you were in the service for 38 years,

27:34.709 --> 27:36.251
what's happened to you in 11 years.

27:36.271 --> 27:37.232
And thank you for your service.

27:37.252 --> 27:37.612
Thank you.

27:38.092 --> 27:38.653
Appreciate it.

27:39.654 --> 27:41.696
Jim Robbins was born to be a flyer.

27:41.716 --> 27:50.024
His grandfather flew SPADs in World War I, his father B-24s in World War II, and his grandson is in the Marine Corps flying Cobras.

27:50.044 --> 27:58.053
You get the idea that at age 70 that he would be flying today if he could, maybe ferrying planes from point A to point B anywhere his country asks.

27:58.473 --> 28:01.596
But for 38 years, he flew with honor and distinction.

28:01.616 --> 28:03.518
And we salute Jim Robbins' service.

28:04.173 --> 28:05.598
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:05.618 --> 28:21.979
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
