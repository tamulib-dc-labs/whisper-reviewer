00:04.098 --> 00:28.256
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:28.656 --> 00:29.818
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:30.794 --> 00:41.272
As a machine gunner with the 86th Black Hawk Division in Europe, Ray Valigura of Bryan bravely fought in World War II and then after its end saw the horror of World War II up close.

00:42.033 --> 00:52.330
While his memories of the war include the camaraderie of the 86th, they just as sharply focused on the remains of the concentration camps and the POW camps that his unit helped liberate.

00:52.951 --> 00:58.241
He'll tell you that as a youth he didn't much think about it, but today the recollections flood back.

00:58.261 --> 01:07.078
Assigned to General Patton's Third Army, in his march through Europe, the 86 Blackhawks was the first unit that returned home after the war intact.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.293
Ray is a retired Texas A&M worker of nearly 30 years.

01:10.573 --> 01:12.235
He and his wife, Jean, live in Bryan.

01:12.735 --> 01:17.260
It is indeed an honor to have Sergeant Ray Valigura on Veterans of the Valley.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.641
Ray, thank you for joining us.

01:19.182 --> 01:19.862
Let's go back.

01:20.203 --> 01:26.529
You told me when you were 17 years old, you were attending a funeral of an uncle, and that's when you heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

01:27.110 --> 01:33.336
Talk about that and sort of take us how your career led from then to being inducted and eventually over to Europe.

01:34.328 --> 01:38.414
Yes, that was December the 7th, 1941.

01:38.434 --> 01:38.915
Yes, sir.

01:39.135 --> 01:43.581
My family attended my uncle's funeral.

01:44.623 --> 01:51.693
And there at the cemetery, the word came out that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.

01:51.713 --> 01:55.538
And of course, it kind of stunned everyone.

01:55.899 --> 02:00.846
Some of the guys were already in training because they anticipated war maybe in Europe.

02:00.866 --> 02:01.787
But anyway...

02:03.067 --> 02:08.273
After that, I worked on a farm for my dad.

02:08.293 --> 02:10.075
We had a 140-acre farm.

02:11.377 --> 02:14.440
I had five brothers older than I am.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.324
And they were all married and out on their own.

02:17.344 --> 02:20.307
So dad and I were sort of left alone.

02:21.028 --> 02:25.954
And there it was almost certainly that I would have to wind up in the service.

02:27.175 --> 02:29.378
So anyway, he rented out the farm.

02:30.826 --> 02:33.424
which he and I were both glad we didn't have to work it.

02:34.351 --> 02:35.942
And...

02:36.496 --> 02:40.460
I was inducted into service January 1943.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.004
I went to Fort Sam Houston.

02:45.044 --> 02:51.730
After a few days, they issued us our equipment and things that were necessary.

02:52.651 --> 03:01.378
And a group of us were shipped out to Camp House, Texas, north of Dallas, near Gainesville.

03:01.398 --> 03:06.503
And there, the 86th Black Hawk Division was activated.

03:06.483 --> 03:15.175
And I had the privilege of serving 42 months in the same unit.

03:15.195 --> 03:28.674
Then after our basic training, we took some training out into the open field for gun range and so forth, and physical training.

03:28.694 --> 03:29.335
And...

03:31.778 --> 03:40.027
After all of this took place, well, I was assigned to a machine gun squad and a heavy weapons company.

03:41.629 --> 03:50.239
And from there, we went to Louisiana Maneuvers, where we pulled actual combat conditions there for three months.

03:51.641 --> 04:01.532
And then after that, we were shipped to San Luis Obispo, California for amphibious landing training.

04:01.512 --> 04:05.603
Thinking at the time that you might be going to the Pacific at that time.

04:05.623 --> 04:10.356
Yes, we anticipated we were going to be in the Pacific theater of war.

04:10.656 --> 04:11.278
Right.

04:11.298 --> 04:15.690
But in the meantime, they had other plans, evidently, for the invasion of Europe.

04:16.773 --> 04:18.036
And...

04:18.016 --> 04:27.267
We were shipped instead across the United States to Camp Miles Standish in Boston, Massachusetts.

04:27.287 --> 04:32.013
And from there we loaded ships, equipment that we might need.

04:32.033 --> 04:36.117
And the D-Day invasion had already taken place the time before.

04:37.439 --> 04:40.783
And we landed in Lahore, France.

04:40.763 --> 04:46.792
And from there, we were issued all equipment that was necessary, vehicles and so forth.

04:47.773 --> 04:51.939
And we started our fighting across France.

04:51.959 --> 04:59.470
We crossed the Rhine River at Cologne and fought into Germany.

04:59.490 --> 05:04.557
Then fighting on through Germany, we'd taken villages and towns and so forth.

05:05.098 --> 05:08.863
Of course, at the time, we didn't know much about where we were,

05:09.198 --> 05:10.720
of where the locations were.

05:11.300 --> 05:14.224
We took our orders and we just carried those things out.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.306
Right, right.

05:16.326 --> 05:24.855
And anyway, we crossed the Danube as a unit, the first unit to cross the Danube River in Engelstadt, Germany.

05:26.237 --> 05:31.543
And from there on we fought and then we were under the command of General George Patton.

05:32.724 --> 05:39.171
And his theory was he wants you to get the enemy on the run to keep him moving

05:39.573 --> 05:42.076
where they can reorganize and counterattack.

05:42.477 --> 05:43.238
Right, and you told me.

05:43.258 --> 05:50.728
Which was a good system because we probably ran into a lot lighter resistance in most cases.

05:51.028 --> 05:55.374
Yeah, you told me over a week's time, or over 20 days' time, you went 100 miles.

05:55.394 --> 06:00.260
That's not far in 20 days, but you kept moving a little bit at a time every day.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.421
Yes, that was what happened.

06:01.442 --> 06:09.512
We were rushed, and we covered, we were later told around 100 miles

06:09.982 --> 06:11.664
in a little over 20 days.

06:11.684 --> 06:14.789
And most of that was on foot.

06:14.969 --> 06:16.572
Riflemen were mostly on foot.

06:16.992 --> 06:24.523
Of course, we in a heavy weapons company, we had vehicles to carry our machine gun mortars and trailers for ammunition.

06:25.324 --> 06:26.446
But we moved fast.

06:27.247 --> 06:32.715
But we later found out what it wound up was aid to the Belgian bulge.

06:34.180 --> 06:49.303
And there, after things were sort of taken over and under control, we remained in the Third Army and we spearheaded around what was known as the Ruhr Valley of Germany.

06:50.127 --> 06:55.992
That's where most of their factories and military equipment was made.

06:57.073 --> 07:03.279
And the 9th Army from the east spearheaded around the other part of the valley.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.462
And we surrounded that.

07:06.482 --> 07:20.134
And we later learned that probably through this operation that the war may have been shortened from eight months to a year because the Germans were cut short of

07:20.114 --> 07:24.771
equipment remanufactured and weapons and whatever they needed.

07:26.858 --> 07:28.183
So the Ruhr Valley

07:28.653 --> 07:35.063
was the area where it was their industrial area is really where a lot of their military equipment was made, where it was stored.

07:35.083 --> 07:39.270
Yes, it was a mountainous area and a lot of factories underground.

07:39.290 --> 07:39.751
Exactly.

07:40.492 --> 07:43.597
And some of the places our bombers and artillery couldn't reach.

07:44.418 --> 07:52.872
But anyway, after this was done, the resistance started becoming lighter and lighter from the German army.

07:53.375 --> 08:03.013
And we moved on and we were in Austria at the foot of the Elf Mountains when we got word that Germany had unconditionally surrendered.

08:03.533 --> 08:08.379
And it was about this time that you also witnessed some of what we talked about on the outset.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.843
You witnessed the liberation.

08:10.863 --> 08:14.728
As a matter of fact, your units were involved in the liberation of POW concentration camps.

08:14.748 --> 08:27.625
Yes, we liberated some camps there where they had some of our prisoners that they had even taken from the Salerno beach that they established in Italy.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.828
And some of those boys were prisoners there.

08:30.922 --> 08:45.032
And we talked to some of them, and they told us that they anticipated maybe the war was coming to an end because they heard the bombardment, the planes coming over, and they had hope.

08:46.126 --> 08:50.111
And I had one boy tell me, he said, you know what I had for breakfast this morning?

08:51.152 --> 09:01.905
He said, I had a piece of bread and a warm glass of milk just to kind of keep my insides open so I could eat later on.

09:01.925 --> 09:10.776
And then we liberated some concentration camps, which was a very tragic and disturbing experience.

09:10.796 --> 09:13.018
These people were near starvation.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.041
They were weakened.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.082
They were ill.

09:17.311 --> 09:20.396
And as we were liberating them, they were marching.

09:21.037 --> 09:29.590
As we were moving in at Convoy, they were marching in single files back to an area where they could be taken care of properly.

09:30.952 --> 09:33.796
And we issued them some rations that we had available.

09:34.738 --> 09:41.648
They tried to hug and kiss us, showed their gratitude.

09:41.628 --> 09:49.980
But we were warned not to make contact with them because of disease, parasites, and they had experience and so forth.

09:50.961 --> 09:51.081
Right.

09:51.101 --> 09:54.967
So after all of this experience, we wound up back in France.

09:56.168 --> 10:03.719
And it wasn't but a few days, maybe two weeks, that we were reorganized and shipped home as a unit.

10:05.021 --> 10:11.550
They told us we would be given 30-day leave and we would reorganize in Camp Gruber, Oklahoma.

10:12.610 --> 10:28.630
And after this took place, we were to meet in Fort Ord, California, to be shipped to the Pacific for the invasion of Japan, as we were probably scheduled to do after our amphibious landing training.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.876
But anyway, in the meantime, when I came home for 30-day leave,

10:36.573 --> 10:45.250
I happened to go to a country dance hall and I saw this young, beautiful lady in pink dress dancing with another girl.

10:45.631 --> 10:51.843
Of course, I guess they didn't have many boys to dance with because most of them were off in service and so forth.

10:51.863 --> 10:53.426
But anyway, I kept her on my mind.

10:53.466 --> 10:56.893
I finally found out her name, Jean Ripple.

10:57.852 --> 10:59.796
She lived in the neighborhood at that time.

11:00.517 --> 11:04.865
She was working in Austin, but she was home.

11:06.028 --> 11:09.174
And I thought about her, and then we shipped to the Pacific.

11:10.256 --> 11:15.025
We were three days out of San Francisco when we heard that they dropped the atomic bomb.

11:15.987 --> 11:17.650
Well, what's the atomic bomb?

11:19.098 --> 11:22.482
But anyway, we found out what terrible destruction it had.

11:23.123 --> 11:28.890
Then one or two days later, they dropped the second bomb, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

11:30.472 --> 11:34.237
And then they began to anticipate that Japan would surrender.

11:35.318 --> 11:39.303
So they stopped us in Manila Harbor in the Philippines.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.745
And there we disembarked.

11:41.726 --> 11:44.650
And we did some mopping up operations.

11:45.187 --> 11:49.102
there in the Philippines on Leyte and Mindanao.

11:50.849 --> 11:52.455
And we did pick up some prisoners.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.530
We hadn't been notified that the war was over.

11:56.999 --> 12:01.083
You told me some prisoners came up behind you when you were playing a game of pinochle one time.

12:01.103 --> 12:11.615
Yes, we were on patrol, the four of us in a jeep, sort of checking out the tickets where they might be hiding.

12:11.635 --> 12:14.738
And we didn't have much to do, so we sat down under a tree.

12:15.539 --> 12:17.201
One of them had a deck of cards with them.

12:17.221 --> 12:19.624
We played pinochle.

12:19.644 --> 12:22.787
And while we were entertained with that, we heard a noise behind us.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.907
We wheeled around, and there was four Japanese soldiers.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.909
They didn't have weapons.

12:28.929 --> 12:33.735
They had their hands over their head, and they were surrendering to us.

12:33.755 --> 12:36.739
That could have been a drastic ending for us right there.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.584
But somehow they got the word that they were being picked up.

12:41.604 --> 12:42.606
And we brought them in.

12:42.686 --> 12:48.853
They put them on KP and our company, and they did the KP work for us.

12:48.873 --> 12:52.217
And we were waiting in the meantime to be shipped back home

12:52.940 --> 13:00.891
The transportation of ships was very scarce because they were in the process of moving the troops in from Europe.

13:02.313 --> 13:12.467
And then we were waiting to get transportation shipping, which was around four or five months.

13:12.447 --> 13:13.428
that we waited.

13:13.789 --> 13:14.670
Right.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.452
In the meantime, we did other things there.

13:16.472 --> 13:20.657
We organized to play baseball.

13:21.898 --> 13:24.922
They had a big baseball stadium there in Manila.

13:25.663 --> 13:29.007
Those people were baseball minded.

13:29.027 --> 13:38.117
And we had some big league baseball players in different service units around the area where they organized teams and we watched them play.

13:38.137 --> 13:41.982
They had a big stadium there seated about 40,000 people.

13:42.097 --> 13:46.444
You told me some of the people that later became Major League Baseball stars at the time.

13:46.464 --> 13:47.746
Well, there were some big leaguers.

13:48.047 --> 13:50.991
For example, Kirby Higbee was in our outfit.

13:51.011 --> 13:52.995
He was a pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

13:53.215 --> 13:53.495
Right.

13:53.936 --> 14:01.388
And pitchers like Gerald Staley, Yul Blackwell, Dominic DiMaggio, Joseph.

14:01.638 --> 14:18.399
Demandio's brother, he was in the Navy, and he played with them, and there was quite a large group of those big league players in service, and they organized, and they had sort of like a World Series between themselves, and we got to see all of that.

14:18.419 --> 14:19.521
You were a left fielder, right?

14:20.482 --> 14:21.283
You played left field?

14:21.500 --> 14:25.249
Yes, on our team I played left field.

14:25.269 --> 14:28.216
And we played ball quite a bit while we were waiting.

14:28.236 --> 14:29.459
Right, right, right.

14:29.620 --> 14:34.491
And then we finally got the ownership to come home.

14:34.512 --> 14:36.556
We landed in San Francisco again.

14:37.519 --> 14:38.040
And...

14:39.708 --> 14:49.566
were shipped to our port of embarkation, I mean the port where we were inducted, and where I went to Fort Sam Houston again in San Antonio.

14:51.129 --> 14:54.074
After a few days I got my honorable discharge.

14:54.896 --> 14:55.457
I went home.

14:57.501 --> 14:59.404
And the dead wasn't farming anymore,

15:00.717 --> 15:04.100
I went to work at the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant in Caldwell.

15:04.340 --> 15:04.700
Yes, sir.

15:05.401 --> 15:09.324
And later I worked at the Western Auto Associates store.

15:09.344 --> 15:13.087
And then I opened my own business in appliance repairs.

15:14.268 --> 15:19.353
And then through a friend, I learned that there has been some openings here at Texas A&M University.

15:20.374 --> 15:25.958
And I applied for air conditioning and refrigeration job, which I got.

15:27.179 --> 15:29.401
And I worked there 21 years.

15:29.802 --> 15:30.302
Wow.

15:30.282 --> 15:32.614
I returned in 1985.

15:33.050 --> 15:36.153
I want to stop you there because I want to go to some pictures that you supplied to us.

15:36.173 --> 15:43.100
And then when we come back, I want you to talk about going back to a dance hall in Dimebox and finding Jean Ripple again.

15:43.621 --> 15:48.746
And that worked out really well, about what, some 59 years later coming up this next August.

15:48.766 --> 15:52.410
But I want to go to some pictures right now that you supplied to us here.

15:52.570 --> 15:56.614
First off, I think that we're going to start with, you can look right over there and see the pictures.

15:57.375 --> 16:01.099
That's a young, 21 years old in that picture.

16:01.703 --> 16:09.197
Blue-eyed, fine-looking soldier there of the 86th Blackhawk Division, Sergeant Ray Valagura.

16:09.698 --> 16:10.540
That's a fine picture.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.205
No wonder Gene was interested.

16:13.245 --> 16:16.050
Now this is a newspaper clipping.

16:16.267 --> 16:21.859
of y'all coming back from, was it coming back from Europe or coming back from Manila?

16:21.879 --> 16:23.583
That's from coming back from Europe.

16:23.823 --> 16:24.766
Coming back from Europe.

16:24.946 --> 16:28.273
After the Germans surrendered.

16:28.293 --> 16:28.574
Right.

16:29.175 --> 16:36.030
And we came back on four transports with the one you see there, I was on the James Parker.

16:36.685 --> 16:41.070
I think there were four boats that you came over and James Parker was one of them.

16:41.090 --> 16:45.755
Transported our division of over almost 15,000 men.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.438
And they threw quite a party for you when you got back to the States.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.681
I want to talk about that in a little bit also.

16:50.721 --> 16:53.764
Let's move on to the next picture.

16:53.885 --> 16:54.846
You're not in this picture.

16:54.866 --> 17:03.756
This picture is from a magazine of the 86 Blackhawk Division, but this is the type of machine gun that you used, right?

17:03.836 --> 17:05.217
Probably somewhere in that group.

17:05.518 --> 17:05.798
Uh-huh.

17:07.347 --> 17:07.948
Big barrel.

17:07.988 --> 17:13.232
Now those machine guns not only on the ground, but they also fitted on the back of Jeeps also, is that right?

17:13.272 --> 17:14.894
Sort of like a tripod?

17:14.934 --> 17:17.196
Tripod mounted, our own vehicle mount we had.

17:18.597 --> 17:24.382
So your division, you both shot the machine guns and drove the Jeeps and everybody did a little bit of everything, right?

17:24.402 --> 17:24.562
Yes.

17:25.583 --> 17:26.284
Indeed.

17:26.304 --> 17:30.267
This is your shadow box of your awards, your medals.

17:31.208 --> 17:36.493
And a lot of those are European theater medals and good conduct medals and World War II medals.

17:36.980 --> 17:51.500
But the one in the, I want you to talk about the ones in the middle, the bronze star medal, and then the rifle in the cluster below that, the blue, because I know those are the two that you're the proudest of.

17:51.660 --> 17:52.341
Infantry badge.

17:54.024 --> 17:56.687
Infantry badge.

17:56.707 --> 17:57.609
Those are the photographs.

17:57.669 --> 18:00.232
Talk about the bronze star medal.

18:00.252 --> 18:02.295
How did you receive that?

18:02.933 --> 18:08.460
Well, we were in a move coming off of a hilltop at that particular time.

18:08.480 --> 18:16.810
And we got shelled heavily by artillery and machine guns far from the Germans.

18:18.112 --> 18:22.798
And, of course, we were sort of caught by surprise.

18:24.871 --> 18:38.028
One of the officers yelled to get the vehicles off of the hilltop away from the barrage because we loaded with ammunition and our troops were all around gathered around our riflemen.

18:38.249 --> 18:45.879
It could have been a disaster if one of those ammunition trucks or jeeps were hit of explosion.

18:45.899 --> 18:50.905
So he yelled to get those vehicles back over the hill.

18:51.786 --> 18:52.988
And when I helped with that,

18:53.609 --> 19:05.416
And under this artillery barrage and the rifle and machine gun fire, I was in a group to move those vehicles out of the danger zone.

19:06.658 --> 19:11.449
And I was recommended for the Bronze Star for this section, which I received.

19:12.948 --> 19:13.830
And you're very proud of that.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.254
And then we saw a minute ago.

19:15.434 --> 19:23.254
I feel like I wasn't doing any more but taking orders and doing my job and what other guys were doing.

19:23.294 --> 19:26.502
But I appreciated the recognition on this part.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.013
Right.

19:27.795 --> 19:41.512
You told me that when you were young that the witnessing of the concentration camps and the POW camps, it didn't mean a whole lot to you then, but as you have grown older and think about it more, that the memories of that really flood back.

19:41.532 --> 19:44.616
It was a difficult part of the horror of war that you remember now.

19:45.758 --> 19:47.220
Talk a little bit more about that if you can.

19:48.081 --> 19:55.290
Yes, you see pictures now of the skeletons and all these people of the torture they went through.

19:55.878 --> 19:58.243
Well, you can believe every bit of that.

19:58.464 --> 20:02.212
Because I've seen most of that and I saw a lot of that.

20:02.232 --> 20:05.539
And it was a very tragic and disturbing thing to see.

20:06.301 --> 20:09.448
And I would like to mention that

20:14.052 --> 20:20.561
Now that the war is going on, I would like to see that things could be settled in other ways.

20:20.862 --> 20:21.182
Right.

20:21.322 --> 20:23.165
Beside war, nothing but tragic.

20:23.205 --> 20:37.866
Because when you think back, not only the enemy, but your comrades, young men in their prime, being wounded, screaming in pain and help.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.959
calling for their parents to come get them.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.625
What little consciousness they had.

20:44.328 --> 20:47.017
Those kind of things are very disturbing.

20:47.057 --> 20:50.168
You kind of accepted that at the time, but

20:50.418 --> 20:55.764
As you think over it now, you think of the boys as what they have to go through.

20:55.784 --> 20:59.528
And also I have two grandsons, Brian and Matthew Swick.

21:00.309 --> 21:16.007
And I'm so thankful that so far they hadn't faced those kind of situations because it's a hardship on the families and a torment on the youngsters and sometimes the cost of their lives or physical abilities.

21:17.669 --> 21:19.311
Very well said.

21:19.848 --> 21:24.295
I want you to talk more about your family in a minute, but I want to go back to Europe.

21:24.916 --> 21:30.785
And you talked about an incident where it was near the end of the war and you were driving, bypassing Paris.

21:31.426 --> 21:35.832
You were in a truck, a three-quarter ton truck, and the brakes went out.

21:35.852 --> 21:36.814
Talk about that story.

21:36.834 --> 21:44.185
Yeah, that was, while we were in combat in France, after so much time and on the front lines,

21:44.485 --> 21:53.257
You got relieved and got to move back where you could have cooked food and hot food and so forth.

21:53.277 --> 22:02.290
And while we were in the rest area, they called for some volunteers to go back to Laharv and pick up some vehicles that we needed.

22:02.310 --> 22:04.753
And about 30 of us volunteered.

22:04.773 --> 22:07.177
And when we got there, we each was assigned a vehicle.

22:08.499 --> 22:13.125
I was assigned a three-quarter ton Dodge weapons carrier.

22:13.105 --> 22:17.330
And after we started out, I found out I didn't have any brakes.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.095
So I drove it the best I could.

22:21.115 --> 22:26.942
I used the emergency brake and geared it down and so forth.

22:27.743 --> 22:33.711
But I finally got word to the convoy leader that I didn't have any brakes.

22:34.772 --> 22:37.255
And he told me, he said, do the best you can.

22:38.076 --> 22:42.201
And if you wreck it, just get in the vehicle behind you because

22:42.181 --> 22:49.051
We were limited on time and also getting out of, you know, a danger zone.

22:50.213 --> 22:54.019
And I finally got the truck back, but I did leave it.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.902
I didn't want any more part of it.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.447
I went back to the company where we were supposed to be.

22:59.933 --> 23:05.000
So while other people were celebrating the end of the war and kissing the girls, you were worried about your breaks.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.023
People in France were celebrating.

23:07.043 --> 23:08.144
They were glad to see us.

23:08.585 --> 23:19.339
You know, most of Paris was bypassed because of the recognition of not destroying, you know, sort of a historical place.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.925
And I think the enemy sort of took it that way too.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.929
But anyway, we drove through Paris on the way back.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.251
That's one of the reasons I went.

23:28.331 --> 23:29.012
I wanted to see it.

23:29.195 --> 23:34.522
more of Paris because we bypassed a few miles on the way to a fighting.

23:35.303 --> 23:38.127
And as we drove through Paris, we went under the rifle tower.

23:38.428 --> 23:38.748
Yes, sir.

23:39.089 --> 23:43.535
And there was people four deep in the streets waving and shouting joy.

23:43.595 --> 23:48.081
You know, they were liberated from the German occupation.

23:48.314 --> 23:56.773
And I did drive under the Eiffel Tower, but I don't remember much about it because I had to watch so I didn't run over somebody.

23:57.414 --> 23:59.258
Because you were out of breaks.

23:59.278 --> 24:03.448
Let's go to Dimebox in that dance hall again where you saw Gene Ripple again.

24:03.909 --> 24:04.931
Okay.

24:04.951 --> 24:07.757
You were sold then, right, because you all got married soon after that.

24:08.260 --> 24:13.270
After I saw her on my 30-day leave, she was on my mind.

24:14.592 --> 24:19.341
And after I got home and got discharged, I went to work.

24:19.361 --> 24:21.726
Well, I went to some dances in the area.

24:21.746 --> 24:24.411
It happened to be Dimebox Dancehall Dance.

24:25.453 --> 24:26.455
And there she was.

24:27.329 --> 24:49.995
again so i asked her to dance we got acquainted and we got to dating for some time and we got engaged and we were married august 3rd 1947 and this august 3rd we'll be married 59 years joyous life we had a daughter

24:49.975 --> 24:55.602
Her family, she's married to Les Swick, Debbie Swick and Les Swick.

24:56.243 --> 25:08.479
Had two grandsons, Brian, that's now working in Charleston, South Carolina, where his wife is going to medical school.

25:08.499 --> 25:12.304
And he's planning to...

25:12.284 --> 25:18.571
Get his master's degree as he graduated from the University of Texas.

25:19.312 --> 25:20.493
Went four years there.

25:21.494 --> 25:29.062
And Matthew, the younger grandson, he is finishing his schoolwork at Blend College here in Bryan.

25:30.164 --> 25:32.286
I know you're very proud of all of them.

25:32.306 --> 25:39.574
For some 21, 22 years, you worked at Texas A&M in the air conditioning and heating unit under the physical plant, right?

25:40.128 --> 25:42.932
I had a wonderful life after I think back over it.

25:42.973 --> 25:45.276
There were some anxious moments.

25:45.296 --> 25:45.617
Yes, sir.

25:46.498 --> 25:53.569
I'm thankful that I made it without any disabilities or major injuries.

25:53.589 --> 25:59.799
Think about some of the guys that had to go through all of this with serious injuries.

26:00.801 --> 26:07.772
I'm very thankful that I made it have a wonderful family, wonderful home, and enjoy my internment.

26:08.326 --> 26:24.141
And you were mildly wounded in the war with some shrapnel wound, but you're the first to say that it was... Yes, I had slight shrapnel wound, but I never went to the medics because we had some medication with us, wound powders and so forth we could apply.

26:24.121 --> 26:28.807
in case we were in an area where didn't have any medics.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.533
Might have worked on someone more seriously injured.

26:32.553 --> 26:36.778
And the main reason I didn't go to the medics, I wanted to stay with the unit.

26:36.798 --> 26:42.887
You know, once you went to the medics, they might have shipped you to a hospital, then you'd be assigned to some other unit.

26:42.967 --> 26:44.509
I was with this group.

26:44.725 --> 26:47.810
over three years, and I wanted to stay with them.

26:47.891 --> 26:50.094
So I tested out a little bit.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.238
Ray, we're out of time, but I want to thank you very much.

26:52.298 --> 26:54.843
You also were a ticket taker at Kyle Field for several years.

26:54.863 --> 26:59.251
We didn't get a chance to talk about that, but thank you for being our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

26:59.491 --> 27:00.012
Thank you, Ray.

27:00.032 --> 27:01.755
I appreciate your interest and help.

27:01.955 --> 27:02.696
Thank you.

27:02.716 --> 27:05.699
Ray Valigura proudly served his country and his community.

27:06.020 --> 27:15.671
And this university, like most soldiers of World War II, he talks with emotion and respect of the men he served alongside, he of his 86th Black Hawk Division.

27:15.951 --> 27:19.895
We salute Sergeant Ray Valigura for his service, and we thank all veterans.

27:19.915 --> 27:22.438
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:22.458 --> 27:29.346
And be sure to read more stories of veterans that you know in the Brazos Valley, in Brazos Valley Heroes, each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:29.326 --> 27:31.308
For Ray Valigura, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:31.328 --> 27:58.793
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
