00:14.830 --> 00:38.796
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.816 --> 00:40.197
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.970 --> 00:50.622
It's a simple fact, World War II could not have been fought, much less won, without the work of the Navy Seabees, formerly known as the United States Navy Construction Battalion.

00:50.982 --> 00:59.432
The Seabees were builders, builders of airstrips, bridges, piers, everything from hospitals to Quonset huts, even builders of bomb shelters.

01:00.133 --> 01:09.745
From November 1942 to a year later, the 14th Seabees Battalion was stationed on perhaps the ultimate hotspot of the Pacific Campaign, Guadalcanal.

01:09.809 --> 01:15.758
Company C painter first class James Rothermel recalls that year with amazing clarity and pride.

01:16.319 --> 01:25.553
Today, 87-year-old James Rothermel and his wife Dorothy Ann live retired in Brenham, a retired educator, former Brenham City Councilman.

01:25.573 --> 01:32.003
James Rothermel takes special pride in the Washington County Veterans Memorial that he spearheaded three years ago.

01:32.590 --> 01:35.635
James Rothermel, it's an absolute pleasure to have you on the show.

01:36.135 --> 01:41.784
Let's talk first about the Seabees, people who might not know what the Seabees are or what they were and the work they did.

01:41.804 --> 01:49.636
I know you told me that mostly the Seabees were a little bit more mature, older people because they had already learned their craft actually before they went into the service, right?

01:50.057 --> 01:50.337
Right.

01:51.078 --> 01:59.291
Mostly all of them were real strong in their craft or their occupation that they were in civilian life.

01:59.851 --> 02:01.534
And most of them were

02:01.970 --> 02:05.435
about 35 to 38 years of age.

02:05.455 --> 02:10.563
And that's for all CB battalions, the early battalions that were organized early 42.

02:11.605 --> 02:17.614
And I being a painter, a construction painter, had about six or seven years of painting.

02:18.174 --> 02:23.202
I was fortunate to have earned a rating of third class petty officers.

02:23.941 --> 02:36.178
You, as a civilian, I know that one of your jobs was to go to the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station and do painting there as a civilian, but it was when there that you got that surge of patriotism and went to Houston and signed up, right?

02:36.358 --> 02:36.638
Right.

02:37.339 --> 02:40.584
And I had a very interesting thing to happen to me there.

02:41.665 --> 02:50.337
I had an ensign that was questioning me and asking me questions and refilling out the questionnaire.

02:50.772 --> 02:55.918
And he said, well, with all the experience you have, you shouldn't be going into the regular Navy.

02:56.319 --> 02:57.961
You need to be going into the Seabees.

02:58.001 --> 02:59.983
And I said, what are the Seabees?

03:00.124 --> 03:01.505
And he explained it to me.

03:02.046 --> 03:06.592
And he said, I'll tell you what, I can give you a third-class petty officer rating.

03:06.612 --> 03:08.374
That made up my mind.

03:08.394 --> 03:11.818
Since I had been at Corpus Christi, I knew about the Navy quite a bit.

03:12.237 --> 03:18.063
I want to fast forward because your stories from Guadalcanal are quite interesting and quite amazing.

03:18.123 --> 03:23.930
But you went to Camp Allen in Virginia, and that's where the 14th Seabees really were commissioned at that time.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.254
Mostly made up of sailors from Texas and Oklahoma, right?

03:28.454 --> 03:29.255
Right.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.418
Yeah, primarily Texas and Oklahoma.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.740
There were a few from each state.

03:34.181 --> 03:37.684
There's several states that maybe a dozen or so, but there's too many to remember.

03:37.724 --> 03:38.245
Right.

03:38.562 --> 03:41.746
You went overseas to Caledonia first, I believe.

03:41.806 --> 04:07.776
Right, we shipped out of San Francisco from Treasure Island, and we went on September 9, 1942, and we landed up in New Mere, Caledonia, waiting orders, and while we were there, I worked on the hospital that was being built during some painting and what have you, whereas most of the other guys had to stay on the ship, and

04:08.363 --> 04:13.230
There was no liberty there, and so consequently didn't know much about New Mir, Caledonia.

04:13.511 --> 04:14.132
Right.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.634
You were there for a couple of months, I think.

04:15.694 --> 04:16.535
About two months, yeah.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.498
And then on to Guadalcanal.

04:18.518 --> 04:26.771
Did you know, did your shipmates know, have a pretty good idea of what a hot spot Guadalcanal was in the war at that time, about the action that was going on there?

04:27.832 --> 04:34.202
Well, it was military scuttlebutt that we were going to Guadalcanal, but we never had really official...

04:34.638 --> 04:37.341
orders presented to us that we were going there.

04:37.602 --> 04:45.151
But we had, you know, the scuttlebutter and the talk, we usually were able to figure out where we were going.

04:45.331 --> 04:45.792
Right.

04:45.812 --> 04:47.134
Now, you all hit the ground running there.

04:47.154 --> 04:52.961
I mean, because immediately when you got there, I know one of your first jobs, you told me, was to build an emergency landing strip.

04:53.021 --> 04:53.481
Is that right?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.083
You need to get a strip on the ground quickly.

04:55.264 --> 04:55.524
Yes.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.186
And we did that within

04:57.554 --> 05:02.419
We started on about November the 29th, and December the 15th we completed.

05:02.459 --> 05:09.446
It was an emergency landing strip for crippled planes from aircraft carriers and those from Henderson Field.

05:09.486 --> 05:17.975
Rather than land on a ship or Henderson Field to tear up the field with a crippled plane, we had this built for that purpose.

05:18.655 --> 05:25.182
I want to get to the story of Captain James Carney in a moment because it's quite a compelling story.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.406
I want people to get the idea of exactly the job that you all had.

05:29.426 --> 05:34.834
You took your own equipment over there as far as the bulldozers and the dump trucks and the things that you needed.

05:34.854 --> 05:46.211
But as far as the supplies, the gravel that it took to just take a piece of land, a piece of terrain that was not suited for a landing strip and create a landing strip that bombers were going to land on.

05:46.572 --> 05:49.876
I cannot imagine what a daunting task that might have been.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.078
Yes, we were very fortunate.

05:51.098 --> 05:53.582
We had bulldozers, maintainers, and

05:53.967 --> 06:08.602
drag lines and cranes and what have you, and 500 or more men on tractors and bulldozers and what have you can do a whole lot of work in just a short while.

06:08.783 --> 06:09.765
Indeed, and you had to.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.169
That's what it is.

06:11.209 --> 06:12.010
I had to.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.832
The gravel that you used, I believe.

06:13.852 --> 06:14.893
We got that out of the river, right?

06:14.913 --> 06:16.836
Yes, we got it out of the Nalamoo River.

06:17.316 --> 06:23.304
And that was the base that we put on before we put the Marsden mat.

06:23.484 --> 06:32.896
It's a steel mat that hooks together and forms a flat surface.

06:32.916 --> 06:38.503
And the planes could land on that without worrying about weather or what have you.

06:38.905 --> 06:41.968
Your commander for the 14th was Captain James Carney.

06:42.188 --> 06:43.670
Talk about Captain Carney.

06:44.391 --> 06:44.651
Yeah.

06:45.832 --> 06:55.061
When we finished the field on December the 15th, he went up to Henderson Field and borrowed a plane.

06:55.081 --> 07:05.672
Being an aviator himself, picked up a gunner and a radio operator, and he came and tested the field, made several landings,

07:06.074 --> 07:18.497
When we got through, we all surrounded the plane, and he commended us very highly, and then he got into the plane to go back, take it back to Henderson Field, and as it went over to Skylark Bay,

07:18.832 --> 07:25.559
motor failed and crashed in the ocean and he and the radio operator Gunnar were killed.

07:25.579 --> 07:31.065
And he is buried there at Guadalcanal at the burial ground there.

07:31.085 --> 07:37.492
And as a tribute to him, the two airstrips that you were about to build after the emergency strip were both named after him.

07:37.913 --> 07:38.713
That's right.

07:38.734 --> 07:42.898
We built Corny 1 and Corny 2 and Corny 1 was a

07:43.469 --> 07:49.599
fields, which had about 7,000 foot runway and taxiway.

07:50.200 --> 07:57.933
And it would accommodate the B-24, B-25, B-26s, and B-17s, and all big bomber planes.

07:58.273 --> 08:03.722
And these planes went ahead and softened up the islands every move towards Japan.

08:03.955 --> 08:07.580
And Kearney 2, which came later, was a longer runway, about 9,000 feet, I believe.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.121
9,000 feet, yeah.

08:09.142 --> 08:12.045
And this was built with concrete landing areas, is that right?

08:12.065 --> 08:12.346
Right, yeah.

08:12.386 --> 08:18.273
Now, we put on that one, on the end, both ends of the field, there was concrete.

08:18.593 --> 08:19.855
There was concrete turnaround.

08:20.716 --> 08:21.277
Right.

08:21.297 --> 08:29.507
And that way, it didn't tear up the marshes and mats so bad, where they had something really solid hit.

08:29.825 --> 08:33.452
B-24 to hit on that Martian mat, it had to give.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.981
And so consequently, their landing part was concrete.

08:38.502 --> 08:42.670
At the same time that you were building these landing strips, I know that

08:43.105 --> 08:44.167
That wasn't your only job.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.070
You all were doing a lot of different things at one time.

08:46.110 --> 08:50.757
And one of the things was your campsite and building your campsite, which included what?

08:50.777 --> 08:55.565
A hospital, a sawmill, the campsite itself, Quonset huts, Dallas huts.

08:55.585 --> 08:58.470
So you all were doing a lot of different things at one time.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.493
Yeah, building road, building bridges.

09:00.894 --> 09:05.782
And we built one particular bridge that I do recall the dimensions on it.

09:05.802 --> 09:09.788
It was about 20 feet wide, 210 feet long, built of solid mahogany.

09:10.207 --> 09:13.531
and it was sawed by our sawmill that we had set up.

09:14.332 --> 09:24.445
The numbers are phenomenal about what you all produced as far as boards and from the sawmill and all of that, and we'll get to that in a little bit.

09:26.368 --> 09:31.074
While this was all going on, you were looking out for the enemy.

09:31.094 --> 09:38.543
While you were not involved in any hand-to-hand combat or direct combat, you were in a defensive mode all the time because there were...

09:38.877 --> 10:01.611
japanese flyers above you looking at you and you had to contend with air rage the whole time right right nearly every evening uh we had what we call a washing machine charlie would come over and fly around and harass us and they usually come in about midnight or thereafter so we wouldn't get a whole good night's sleep and it was more arrested harassment than anything and

10:01.979 --> 10:05.685
before he left, he would drop his bum somewhere on the island.

10:07.188 --> 10:21.051
Then we had a group up in the mountains that had a heavy piece of artillery, I guess a 75 or 90 millimeter, I don't know how big it was, but it would lob shells over

10:21.368 --> 10:33.652
At noon, at our mess hall, so we'd have to run and then go back and eat and all that stuff.

10:34.394 --> 10:37.941
But he never tried to hit a mess hall, never tried to hit anybody.

10:37.961 --> 10:39.023
It was just harassment.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.044
Guadalcanal was no walk in the park.

10:41.084 --> 10:45.470
It was a pretty miserable place as far as the weather, the heat, the mosquitoes.

10:46.170 --> 10:49.274
And so another enemy that you were battling was illness.

10:49.294 --> 10:50.616
Was malaria, yes.

10:51.237 --> 10:52.738
Yes, malaria was very bad.

10:52.818 --> 10:58.285
And we had casualties from malaria every day.

10:58.325 --> 11:04.933
And I guess totally while we were there, we were there nearly a year.

11:04.953 --> 11:08.217
And we lost about 500 people.

11:08.517 --> 11:09.779
men to malaria.

11:11.502 --> 11:22.860
I know that right after you completed your campsite, it was just, what, a couple of weeks later that a torrential rain caused a flood to that campsite, and a lot of the patients that were at the hospital at the time had to be evacuated.

11:22.940 --> 11:23.441
Is that right?

11:23.601 --> 11:24.583
That's right.

11:24.603 --> 11:25.344
That's true.

11:25.925 --> 11:26.446
Yes.

11:27.347 --> 11:34.238
We had a flood that hadn't been that big for years, so the natives told us, and we had to wait out

11:34.690 --> 11:36.553
waist deep and shoulder deep water.

11:36.593 --> 11:37.595
It was shoulder deep for me.

11:37.675 --> 11:40.059
Most of the guys waist deep because I was kind of small.

11:40.660 --> 11:45.888
But we would move to the beach to the 20th Army Command.

11:46.529 --> 11:51.257
And they put us up for the night and fed us breakfast the next morning.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.259
And we went back.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.504
The river went back down by noon that next night.

11:56.165 --> 11:59.510
And then about three days later, we had another flood, but we didn't have to move out.

11:59.530 --> 12:00.512
It wasn't quite as great.

12:01.387 --> 12:09.777
I want people to get an idea of exactly what you all were able to accomplish because the Seabees, in my estimation, they build something out of nothing is what your job is.

12:10.939 --> 12:17.427
You write in your summary of your service, the 14th compiled the following numbers while on Guadalcanal.

12:17.787 --> 12:21.792
Highest water output in one day, 89,460 gallons.

12:22.733 --> 12:45.417
nearly 2 million gallons for the month of June 43, 46 tons of ice for June, sawmill production of 7,200 board feet in one day, 188,500 board feet in one month, and extraction of 127,000 tons of gravel from the river to build these airstrips.

12:45.717 --> 12:48.001
Those numbers are just mind-boggling.

12:48.021 --> 12:49.704
I guess they're still mind-boggling to you.

12:50.024 --> 12:50.625
They are, really are.

12:51.287 --> 12:52.729
That you could do something like that.

12:55.534 --> 13:05.471
The second airstrip of Kearney Field was built, and you also, another one of your projects I know was building a tank farm for gasoline and oil, right?

13:05.571 --> 13:06.713
Talk about what was involved there.

13:08.026 --> 13:13.453
Well, we had the sheet metal people and welders and what have you built the tanks.

13:14.133 --> 13:17.077
They had the sheet metal that was sent to them and riveted.

13:17.718 --> 13:21.843
And then one of our jobs was to paint it.

13:21.863 --> 13:34.438
And then our job was to build a pipeline out into the bay where the ship would not have to, could come up rather to this buoy and pump the oil right on into the tanks.

13:34.698 --> 13:36.160
Right, right, right.

13:36.747 --> 13:40.391
I built a bridge too, 210-foot bridge, I believe, something like that.

13:40.411 --> 13:40.791
Yes, right.

13:43.674 --> 13:46.757
So the Seabees, that was just their job.

13:46.797 --> 13:48.739
Now, your particular job, you were a painter.

13:48.979 --> 13:49.480
Right.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.702
If it needed to be painted, you painted it.

13:51.742 --> 13:52.363
We painted it.

13:52.543 --> 13:56.547
Talk more specifically about what your job was and what you did.

13:57.027 --> 14:04.695
Well, primarily, I was in the shop, but we had a small crew, about four or five persons.

14:05.131 --> 14:11.097
And when it built the hospital, we had to paint the huts.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.300
We had to camouflage them, rather, and we painted inside.

14:14.580 --> 14:19.986
And like the officer's mess in our mess hall, we painted inside to make it look nice.

14:20.146 --> 14:23.189
And whatever needed painting, well, we did it.

14:23.209 --> 14:27.734
And we primarily were a sign shop.

14:27.814 --> 14:35.121
We did a lot of signs, not only just for my outfit, but all of the outfits on the island that needed sign work done.

14:35.894 --> 14:37.176
Talk about Easter Sunday of 1943.

14:37.196 --> 14:37.356
Yes.

14:37.497 --> 14:42.004
Now, that was quite an enterprise.

14:43.186 --> 14:49.216
On the flat areas where we built our airfield, there was grass about six to eight feet tall.

14:50.038 --> 14:52.361
And they cleared the area there for us.

14:52.381 --> 14:58.712
And I don't know, several hundred, maybe a thousand people gathered from all units together.

14:59.013 --> 15:06.520
That morning we had the Navy band and it played.

15:07.021 --> 15:19.333
And we had one of the chaplains, I can't recall who it was, and one of the native preachers preached a sermon also for us in Pigeon English and had a native choir.

15:20.194 --> 15:22.636
And it was at sunrise, Easter Sunday morning.

15:22.936 --> 15:28.682
And we had breakfast and we had...

15:29.320 --> 15:33.167
boiled eggs and toast, I think it was.

15:33.969 --> 15:37.135
That's very simple, but it was enjoyed by everyone.

15:37.155 --> 15:42.705
And the camaraderie that it created among those outfits around us,

15:43.107 --> 15:46.090
I think it was the most wonderful day for all of those that attended.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.392
And it's obviously something that you remember well.

15:48.412 --> 15:49.152
That's right, yeah.

15:49.533 --> 15:55.718
You are a historian of your service and of World War II, and you've brought some pictures to share with us.

15:56.378 --> 16:02.784
And I want to go ahead and go to some of those photographs right now that were taken of you and by you.

16:02.804 --> 16:05.206
Here is the young sailor, James Rothermel.

16:05.226 --> 16:06.988
Do you remember when this was taken?

16:07.008 --> 16:12.152
Yeah, it was in 1942 in San Francisco.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.790
This was just right prior to being shipped out.

16:16.493 --> 16:23.086
And my Navy buddy, best buddy Bill Oscombe, took that picture with his camera.

16:23.106 --> 16:25.050
You looked young and eager and ready to go.

16:25.070 --> 16:25.611
Yeah, I was.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.699
I'm going to go ahead and move on.

16:29.719 --> 16:32.605
Here's another picture of you and some of your...

16:33.091 --> 16:35.014
Some of your buddies here, talk about that picture.

16:35.054 --> 16:35.715
Where was that taken?

16:35.916 --> 16:42.006
This was taken at Guadalcanal, and this is right outside of where the hospital that we were building.

16:42.927 --> 16:47.475
And the two guys standing on the left is L.V.

16:47.515 --> 16:55.388
Bryant and Enoch Henderson on the right, and myself on the left, Squatting, and Stedman on the right.

16:55.408 --> 16:57.411
I can't recall his first name right now.

16:57.644 --> 16:58.987
It looks like you're very hot there.

16:59.007 --> 17:04.838
Yes, we were about 10 degrees off the equator, around 120 degrees.

17:07.363 --> 17:08.425
Got another one here.

17:08.445 --> 17:12.313
Now, this is a photograph of you actually in your paint shop.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.014
Talk about that.

17:13.034 --> 17:15.700
That was at Okinawa a little bit later on, right?

17:15.720 --> 17:19.467
Well, yes, and that's a typical paint shop that we also had in

17:20.071 --> 17:30.843
Guadalcanal, that Bill Oskins at the easel, and Mr. Harrison on the left, and myself on the right.

17:30.863 --> 17:32.926
And so... This was your office?

17:33.566 --> 17:34.608
That was our office, right.

17:34.628 --> 17:35.088
That was your office?

17:35.108 --> 17:37.050
That was our shop, yeah.

17:37.070 --> 17:45.100
Okay, we're gonna move on, and we're gonna go back to a photograph here of... This is back in Guadalcanal.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.261
Guadalcanal.

17:46.281 --> 17:49.825
This is a living area, the Company C area.

17:50.193 --> 17:55.580
And we lived in the tents, and you see just a partial on the right, an army cot.

17:56.381 --> 18:00.827
And this was very early, and I stayed at Guadalcanal.

18:01.248 --> 18:09.419
Later on, we floored the tents and screened them in and had doors, and consequently, it made pretty nice living.

18:09.459 --> 18:11.962
But at that point, it was pretty rugged.

18:12.784 --> 18:14.866
And that's you in the foxhole right there?

18:14.886 --> 18:17.550
That's myself in the foxhole, yeah, or the bump shelter.

18:18.037 --> 18:22.021
It would hold eight people very well.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.745
You didn't get a lot of chances to sleep a whole lot in your tent.

18:25.846 --> 18:31.232
I guess a lot of nights you were spending the night in the foxhole because of Pistol Pete and Washing Machine Charlie, right?

18:31.632 --> 18:35.817
Yeah, and it was really quite a sight to see when Washing Machine Charlie came over.

18:37.218 --> 18:48.010
We had searchlights and every once in a while they'd get him in the lights and the aircraft guns would shoot at him and we'd watch and we'd sit out there and hooray and hurrah and

18:48.327 --> 19:07.129
holler and say, you know, dirty things about the Japanese, but anyway, but they did, they kept us, you'd get up and then they'd show you from the sea every once in a while, not very often, but, and we did have one night where a big bomb dropped in our camp area.

19:07.149 --> 19:08.330
Right, 500 pound bomb.

19:08.350 --> 19:09.411
500 pound bomb.

19:10.593 --> 19:11.854
That got you scurrying, right?

19:12.172 --> 19:13.353
That got you scurrying?

19:13.373 --> 19:16.637
Yeah, it got us scurrying, and that's how come we had this type of bomb shelter.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.197
Right.

19:17.217 --> 19:17.518
Yeah.

19:17.538 --> 19:18.238
Indeed, indeed.

19:19.239 --> 19:26.547
Early in your training, even when you got out of high school in Brenham, woodworking was one of the skills that you learned, and that came to use later on.

19:26.567 --> 19:35.757
We've got a photograph right here of a plaque, actually, that you and I believe another one of your fellow sailors... Yeah, William Oscombe, he's passed on.

19:35.777 --> 19:38.820
Now, that plaque was made out of mahogany and...

19:39.138 --> 19:43.322
of maple and make strips and then glued together.

19:44.083 --> 19:57.315
And the top part up there where it shows the bulldozer and the guy looking through a level in platinum leaf and the lettering on the back is gold leaf.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.617
And there were two of those made.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.098
One went to Washington, D.C.

20:01.639 --> 20:05.042
and the other one is located at Port Wyoming, California at the C.V.

20:05.402 --> 20:06.343
National Museum.

20:07.302 --> 20:09.625
That's something that I know that you're very, very proud of.

20:09.645 --> 20:11.048
It really is.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.750
Got another photograph now.

20:13.211 --> 20:17.717
There's a bunch of happy sailors right here in this photograph that we're going to look at here next.

20:17.838 --> 20:21.703
I guess this is pretty much at the end of your overseeing duty.

20:21.783 --> 20:22.404
Talk about this.

20:22.605 --> 20:28.293
It was coming home from Okinawa, and I tell you, we were a happy group.

20:30.096 --> 20:36.465
You just couldn't imagine how happy we were, and the war was over with, and we were going to go home to our loved ones,

20:36.698 --> 20:42.383
what we were used to and going to try to change our lives, which I did.

20:42.463 --> 20:47.107
I don't know if we have something on that or not, but yes, this was quite something.

20:49.149 --> 20:50.250
We will be talking about it.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.090
We came home on New Yorktown.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.191
Right.

20:52.211 --> 21:05.743
And that was another experience with the fact that they cleared the hangar deck and they marked off a plate for each one of your bedrolls and had about 5,000 people sleeping and

21:06.230 --> 21:09.775
staying on a hangar deck for 14 days coming from Tokyo, Japan.

21:09.795 --> 21:11.718
Right, right, right.

21:11.858 --> 21:17.707
I want to talk to you here now, and then we'll go to a picture in just a moment, about the Washington County Veterans Memorial.

21:17.767 --> 21:25.859
This was sort of your child that you sort of spearheaded for a couple of years in your life, and now it's a reality in Brenham.

21:25.919 --> 21:29.284
Talk about it, and we're going to go to a photograph of it while you're talking about it.

21:29.551 --> 21:50.573
Well, the presidents, well, the commanders of the American Legion post there at Brenham, we have a Galva Club, and this Galva Club had some money on hand, and the building of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.

21:51.234 --> 21:56.740
was being started and big drive for money, and so

21:57.057 --> 22:04.529
We voted to send $500 to this memorial for its completion.

22:04.549 --> 22:10.159
And went back to the post and reported what we did.

22:11.281 --> 22:17.832
Then it was mentioned then that maybe we ought to build us a memorial here for the veterans of Washington County.

22:18.573 --> 22:20.256
And that went on for a couple of years.

22:20.336 --> 22:22.339
We discussed it many hours, many times.

22:22.792 --> 22:28.400
And one night I said, look, we've talked this to death, and it's time for us to do something about it.

22:28.420 --> 22:33.807
And the commander pointed at me, and he says, Rothamil, you are chairman of this group.

22:34.408 --> 22:40.836
And he pointed at two other people, and then we worked about two and a half years and finally finished it.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.338
It's something you're very proud of.

22:42.459 --> 22:43.019
I am very proud of it.

22:43.039 --> 22:47.385
And you took me the other day to it, and I was very honored to see it.

22:47.405 --> 22:50.149
That's the most honorable thing I think I've ever done in my life.

22:50.635 --> 22:56.383
Well, I would say in your service in World War II, I would say would be right up there with it.

22:56.984 --> 23:01.751
We've only got about three or four minutes left, but you finally leave Guadalcanal.

23:01.791 --> 23:03.814
You come back to the States for about a year.

23:03.854 --> 23:04.695
You're in California.

23:04.715 --> 23:07.619
You get to go home for a while, but you're not through going overseas.

23:08.040 --> 23:12.426
You head back over to Hawaii and then to Okinawa.

23:12.466 --> 23:15.109
Sort of talk about your post-Guadalcanal service.

23:15.991 --> 23:20.457
Well, we went to Hawaii, and we were to train...

23:20.690 --> 23:23.114
went for training for jungle training.

23:23.434 --> 23:24.616
You'd already been there and done that.

23:24.656 --> 23:25.197
That's right.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.502
And it was the most depressing thing, I guess, my outfit had to do.

23:28.542 --> 23:31.066
And I was one of them that really griped about it myself.

23:31.787 --> 23:38.437
And then we went from Hawaii to Saipan and loaded LSTs and what have you.

23:39.199 --> 23:42.444
And about April the 25th, I went and looked back.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.368
It's when we landed at Okinawa.

23:45.428 --> 23:47.912
The initial landing was April the 1st.

23:48.365 --> 23:55.512
And we were there then at Okinawa through till September the 2nd when the war was over with.

23:57.193 --> 24:03.259
I know you told the story about when you were going over on an LST and a torpedo came right on.

24:03.519 --> 24:05.661
You were on an LST that was loaded with gasoline.

24:05.681 --> 24:06.062
That's right.

24:06.182 --> 24:12.067
And a torpedo, which was evidently geared for a much larger ship, came underneath you and fortunately missed.

24:12.087 --> 24:13.068
It just went on through us.

24:13.088 --> 24:13.509
And why?

24:13.689 --> 24:15.030
I don't know, but anyway.

24:15.398 --> 24:19.082
So there's a lot of defense involved in what you were doing.

24:19.142 --> 24:21.665
I guess I know that you count yourself very fortunate.

24:21.885 --> 24:22.306
I have.

24:22.326 --> 24:23.527
I've been very fortunate.

24:23.607 --> 24:32.136
You were discharged from the Navy, honorably, of course, and you went into a career of education.

24:32.176 --> 24:34.779
I know you were a principal at Ganado and at Schulenburg.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.082
Talk a little bit about your career.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.244
We've got a couple of minutes after your service.

24:41.406 --> 24:42.908
Well, when I went into the teaching,

24:43.141 --> 24:43.642
profession.

24:43.662 --> 24:45.043
I taught at Brenham three years.

24:45.443 --> 24:50.649
I was a general classroom teacher there in Garnado and Schulenburg.

24:50.729 --> 24:52.270
I was a high school principal.

24:52.691 --> 25:01.399
And then from Garnado, I went to Pasadena, to San Jacinto College, and became an instructor.

25:01.419 --> 25:04.082
And a short while after, I was department chairman of business.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.587
And then I became division chairman of business administration department.

25:08.607 --> 25:10.469
And I retired from San Jacinto College.

25:10.489 --> 25:11.950
I was 14 years there.

25:12.301 --> 25:21.730
1978 and spent a couple more years in Pasadena and we decided to move to Brenham and we're there now and still going strong.

25:22.190 --> 25:23.071
And still enjoying it.

25:23.111 --> 25:31.078
You and Dorothy Ann, your wife, are about to celebrate, I believe, your 58th wedding anniversary a little bit later this month.

25:31.218 --> 25:32.319
August 24th.

25:32.719 --> 25:39.646
And I know Dorothy Ann is very involved in auxiliary there in Brenham with VFW or American Legion.

25:39.666 --> 25:40.286
American Legion.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.127
American Legion.

25:41.579 --> 25:45.606
And I was commander of the post, and she was president of the post at the same time.

25:46.247 --> 25:47.709
So it was a husband and wife team.

25:47.850 --> 25:48.871
You were even a politician.

25:48.891 --> 25:52.377
You were on the Brenham City Council and Mayor Pro Tem for a few years.

25:52.417 --> 25:57.546
Yeah, I was on the council for 14 years, and of those 14 years, eight of them were Mayor Pro Tem.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.400
You have a grandson.

26:01.640 --> 26:11.058
You have six grandchildren, but one of them, Matthew, I know, served in Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he's currently in Africa, a young man that I know that you and your wife are very proud of.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.501
Yes, we are very proud of him.

26:12.882 --> 26:18.893
And he hoped to come home in December, but he's over there now being a

26:19.312 --> 26:28.950
humanitarian, and they're working, helping people over there in Africa, and that's their goal.

26:29.171 --> 26:35.403
Well, God bless him, and I know your two sons and your grandchildren, and thank you very, very much for visiting with us today.

26:35.423 --> 26:37.907
Thank you for letting me be a part of this.

26:37.988 --> 26:40.813
I tell you, I'm so proud that you're doing this.

26:41.097 --> 26:43.904
I'll watch it every chance I get.

26:44.847 --> 26:46.250
Thank you, James Rothermel.

26:46.932 --> 26:51.424
I visited the Rothermel's home in Brenham this past week and it's almost like a military museum.

26:51.604 --> 26:54.111
Indeed, a testament to not just his own service,

26:54.428 --> 27:00.038
but to his personal pride to have served, and specifically, in the United States Navy Construction Battalion.

27:00.459 --> 27:05.267
Today, we salute the Navy Seabees and Painter First Class James Rothermel for his service.

27:05.668 --> 27:09.975
And while in Brenham, please don't miss the magnificent Washington County Veterans Memorial.

27:09.995 --> 27:14.343
Please thank a veteran today, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:14.363 --> 27:15.284
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:15.545 --> 27:17.989
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
