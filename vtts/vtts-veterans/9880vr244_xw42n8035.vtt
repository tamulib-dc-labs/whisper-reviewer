Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.198 --> 00:37.260
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.932 --> 00:45.144
Most every World War II veteran counts themselves lucky to have survived to tell their story when so many did not.

00:45.785 --> 00:59.147
Ray Adkins service came near the war's end, but included 82 days fighting in the Pacific's bloodiest battle, Okinawa, the battle that killed more than 12,000 Americans and left another 36,000 wounded.

00:59.532 --> 01:07.886
As a member of a special weapons unit in the 1st Marines Division, his was the third wave to storm the beach that April 1st, 1945.

01:09.048 --> 01:18.925
Okinawa was to be a main staging area for the ground assault on Japan, the assault that never happened because of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

01:19.394 --> 01:22.318
over the next two episodes of Veterans of the Valley.

01:22.338 --> 01:31.649
We'll hear not only some of Ray Adkins' war stories from World War II, but some of his stories of a legendary 38-year high school football coaching career.

01:32.270 --> 01:40.000
One that produced a quarterback named Marty Adkins, who went on to run Darryl Royall's wishbone attack at the University of Texas.

01:40.020 --> 01:47.089
And we'll talk about Ray Adkins, the proud grandfather of another quarterback you may recognize, a fellow named Drew Brees.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.679
Please welcome Coach Ray Adkins to Veterans of the Valley.

01:50.699 --> 01:55.948
Ray, it's more than an honor to meet you, to know you, and to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:55.968 --> 02:02.899
Let's talk about when you were in high school as a junior in Brady, that's when Pearl Harbor was attacked, December 7, 1941.

02:02.979 --> 02:08.128
So you knew then that you were going to be in the military and you were going to be going to war eventually, right?

02:08.469 --> 02:09.450
Absolutely.

02:09.490 --> 02:10.091
We knew that.

02:10.953 --> 02:14.258
And we wanted to do something, you know, for our country.

02:14.862 --> 02:25.253
And about 10 of us from Brady boys about in February that year decided that we wanted to go join up.

02:25.273 --> 02:28.236
And so we got our diplomas early.

02:28.676 --> 02:28.916
Right.

02:29.557 --> 02:37.005
And we went to San Antonio and us 10 and there was about 100 boys that wanted to be in the Marines.

02:38.126 --> 02:43.992
And so they gave us quite a few tests, mental tests and physical tests and

02:44.478 --> 02:49.643
thinking quick, making quick decisions.

02:49.663 --> 02:53.627
And I believe there was about 10 that they picked out of that 100.

02:55.068 --> 02:56.689
And I happened to be one of those.

02:57.370 --> 03:02.775
And then we got to San Diego, California.

03:03.776 --> 03:11.363
And so I would say that when we got through with boot camp, there was about three of those 10

03:11.933 --> 03:14.135
that were still left there.

03:14.336 --> 03:21.143
And I could tell a lot of stories that they don't do now to train, you know, like they used to.

03:21.404 --> 03:21.664
Right.

03:21.984 --> 03:30.413
When you went to San Diego, you were a teenager, and I think you said, I read that your dad took you to the train station, and he gave you some advice as he put you on the train.

03:30.434 --> 03:31.014
What was that?

03:31.034 --> 03:34.498
He did, and I think it's good advice today.

03:34.748 --> 03:44.842
You know, my dad and mother never smoked or drank or anything like that, and he didn't, and actually we had been grown up that way, and so we rode a horseback in, really.

03:45.383 --> 03:57.920
And he took my horse back home, but he said, son, now when you get on that train, you're going to be, they're going to say, have a smoke, boy, or have, you know, buddy, have a drink.

03:58.721 --> 04:03.287
And I said, he said, now, you know,

04:03.419 --> 04:10.347
When you have a question that you don't know about, he said, just say, what would my mother and daddy say?

04:10.367 --> 04:11.848
And that's your answer right there.

04:13.110 --> 04:17.535
And sure enough, when I got on the train, you know, have a smoke or have a drink.

04:18.055 --> 04:21.899
And I think a lot of young people, they think they're kind of pressured into it.

04:21.919 --> 04:30.048
But, you know, I told those young men that was doing that, I said, look, I respect your choices and what you want to do.

04:30.088 --> 04:31.029
You respect mine.

04:31.330 --> 04:31.570
Right.

04:31.735 --> 04:35.699
And if you don't respect mine, then I'm not going to cooperate at all with you.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.642
And you still had neither, right?

04:37.682 --> 04:43.749
I never smoked a cigarette in my life, and you could put all the other stuff in one beer can.

04:44.970 --> 04:45.370
Exactly.

04:45.791 --> 04:48.314
You got away from home, and you got a quick taste of the Marines.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.316
A pretty rough drill instructor, I understand.

04:50.877 --> 04:52.298
Yes, I sure did.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.660
I'll tell you this.

04:53.760 --> 05:00.848
I even, you know, we were out on the parade ground, and I...

05:01.199 --> 05:06.866
I was thinking about home and we were coming in on the parade ground after being out in the boondocks.

05:07.547 --> 05:09.670
And he hollered up there.

05:09.690 --> 05:11.012
They didn't you didn't have a name.

05:11.092 --> 05:12.073
You had a number.

05:12.093 --> 05:12.654
Right.

05:12.674 --> 05:14.977
And I believe my name was my number was 64.

05:16.138 --> 05:20.143
I didn't I always when they'd call out a number, I'd say, oh, man, I hope he hears it.

05:20.164 --> 05:21.746
But that day I didn't hear mine.

05:21.946 --> 05:29.856
You know, and first thing I know, I'm jerked out of that line and knocked down on there, you know, throw down on the ground and on the pavement.

05:30.275 --> 05:34.080
And, you know, they just tell you they're going to kick your brains out.

05:34.100 --> 05:34.220
Right.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.322
And so I believed them.

05:36.342 --> 05:38.765
And I tell you what, I couldn't even sleep at night hardly.

05:38.785 --> 05:42.189
You know, I mean, I'd wake up at night wondering where I was, you know, if everything was OK.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.072
But we'd go out.

05:44.833 --> 05:48.978
Sometimes they'd get us up at three o'clock in the morning and take us out.

05:49.038 --> 05:54.124
And I guess you'd say the bay and the water is about three feet deep or two and a half.

05:54.685 --> 05:56.687
And we'd have our full pack and they would.

05:56.937 --> 06:00.821
you had to pick up your knees just like you did in football, you know, we'd run the tires.

06:01.382 --> 06:03.605
And, of course, you couldn't shove the water.

06:03.625 --> 06:06.768
So that was just one of our trainings.

06:06.888 --> 06:16.199
I guess one of the things that was probably the most scariest was when we fought with bayonets, you know, we took everything, every segment.

06:16.259 --> 06:20.864
And so we were fighting with bayonets and hand-to-hand combat.

06:20.884 --> 06:22.506
And I...

06:22.874 --> 06:50.417
uh about the after about the third or fourth day they said take it about 112 degrees too out there. They said uh okay now we take those covers off those bayonets and boy did they shine, and sharp as razors, and there's a lot of guys got hurt right, but uh it was a it was some people think well that's not good, but you know I mean you may hurt your buddy or you know you're fighting for your life too and he is so when you get over there but

06:50.650 --> 06:52.695
Here's the way I looked at it.

06:53.015 --> 06:58.047
If you're going to play football, you've got to practice tackling and blocking.

06:58.067 --> 07:03.740
And if you're going to fight for your life, you've got to go through the real stuff.

07:04.702 --> 07:08.170
And so there was a number of things, but that's just one.

07:08.926 --> 07:17.462
You were part of the 1st Marine Division that got a little extra training because you were headed to Okinawa for the final invasion of the war.

07:17.502 --> 07:23.033
And like we said at the beginning, this was supposed to be the staging area for the assault in Japan.

07:23.053 --> 07:26.640
Let's go ahead and get there to Okinawa.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.183
A lot of the Marines had been sent to

07:28.433 --> 07:34.881
to Iwo Jima for that final stand at Iwo Jima, but you were sent to Okinawa.

07:35.282 --> 07:40.248
Talk about some of your thoughts about where you were going and your role in the battle.

07:40.268 --> 07:44.193
Well, let me say just a few words about before we went there.

07:44.473 --> 07:57.850
We did our training a couple or two or three places, but before we did for that, we went to Guadalcanal to actually take all of the

07:58.218 --> 08:11.354
ammunition and everything there, and try to let those Japanese know that the war was over, and they were still, you know, snipering, and we were snipering, and then we went, but we had an island there called Pavuvu Island.

08:11.374 --> 08:11.795
Right.

08:11.915 --> 08:12.976
P-A-V-U-V-U.

08:13.036 --> 08:14.438
I don't have any people that ever heard of it.

08:14.898 --> 08:16.240
And it had one named White Beach.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.843
It's close to Midway, and that's where we trained.

08:19.144 --> 08:19.344
Right.

08:19.364 --> 08:21.907
For about two or three, I'd say, two months.

08:22.568 --> 08:22.708
Mm-hmm.

08:22.728 --> 08:27.634
And because we were amphibious, so we were landing, and, you know, and...

08:27.850 --> 08:30.373
out in the water and different things like that.

08:30.393 --> 08:45.030
But then we spent 61 days on the troop ship, and you could just look out and see these ships every morning and that, and then battle wagons, cruisers, everything.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.614
But we carried about 6,000 men on one troop ship.

08:49.796 --> 08:55.242
And so when we got, I was just hoping I'd live to be 20.

08:55.660 --> 09:02.409
And before we got there, of course, we didn't know all of what was going on.

09:02.469 --> 09:05.152
Nobody did, but the higher-ups did.

09:05.212 --> 09:10.939
And so the 2nd Marine Division actually landed on the south end of Okinawa.

09:11.981 --> 09:16.727
And that was to pull as much of their troops and their guns that way.

09:16.747 --> 09:19.390
And I was in the 1st Marine Division.

09:19.673 --> 09:35.047
I mean, you know, so we, the 1st and the 6th Marine Division, we went around into the China Sea, and we hit about where the middle of Okinawa was at the Yontan Airfield.

09:35.067 --> 09:43.835
And we got off of the ship out there, the troop ship, probably 10 miles or 15, 20 miles out.

09:43.855 --> 09:48.499
And we were on these little LSVP, you know, and landing craft vehicle personnel.

09:48.884 --> 09:52.149
And so probably about 10 or 15 Marines on each one.

09:52.830 --> 10:01.603
And these cocksmen, they need to get you up where your water wasn't over your head, so when you got out of the boat, you know, before you hit the beach.

10:01.624 --> 10:11.439
So we hit that, and in three days, we cut Okinawa in two, and the 10th Army went south, and we went north.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.967
And about two weeks, we secured the north, because most of their

10:17.470 --> 10:22.857
big guns and everything had been pulled south with our 2nd Marine Division landing there.

10:23.057 --> 10:29.585
And after they landed, they actually landed there, and then they pulled back off of there, but we had them trapped down there.

10:30.126 --> 10:42.661
And after you secured the north, then you headed back down south, and that was really one of the first times, or one of the significant times, that you really witnessed the horror of war, I know, because of what you saw when you headed back south.

10:42.741 --> 10:43.863
Talk about that.

10:43.883 --> 10:47.207
Well, of course, you know, it had been a lot of big

10:47.542 --> 10:52.369
bombs dropped and there had been a lot of those big 16-inch shells, you know, laid in there.

10:53.010 --> 11:10.014
But there was, I really felt sorry for our troops because you couldn't take a step, three or four steps in any direction without stepping on a dead Jap or a dead soldier.

11:10.335 --> 11:12.638
Right.

11:12.972 --> 11:20.565
You know, we actually then joined up with the 10th Army at the Yontan Airfield and started pushing south.

11:21.287 --> 11:24.512
And that's what took a lot of time because they were real fortified.

11:25.213 --> 11:30.222
You know, they had big guns that they'd bring out at night.

11:30.623 --> 11:34.069
And, well, I was on a flamethrower quite a bit.

11:34.268 --> 11:37.011
and, you know, you strap on your back.

11:37.031 --> 11:44.279
And I wasn't so much worried about getting hit myself or shot as I was that napalm getting hit, you know, I mean, there because he was a goner.

11:45.060 --> 12:02.740
And I've actually seen those big flame throwers on those tanks shoot out and actually just, if you take a matchstick and, you know, you burn it down, and I didn't realize that there was so much liquid in a person, a human being.

12:03.108 --> 12:31.056
or you know that they would just melt you know on on and just still be just a skeleton there right talk about what you saw as part of the japanese and their their method of doing battle was obviously very unique they were they they were fight to the death attitude and uh their method of hiding themselves uh it was unbelievable they could hide for six or seven days and they they really were trained to

12:31.475 --> 12:38.989
And they believed that they were going to be, you know, that was the rising sun.

12:39.009 --> 12:39.850
You know, that was theirs.

12:39.910 --> 12:42.916
That they would be actually doing a great service.

12:43.417 --> 12:49.748
And as far as their religion is concerned, they believed that that would be the greatest thing they ever did.

12:49.928 --> 12:50.109
Right.

12:50.129 --> 12:54.477
But they would hide under things.

12:55.098 --> 12:55.238
Right.

12:55.690 --> 12:59.815
They would wait until they really had a chance to get two or three of you if they could.

13:00.076 --> 13:00.516
Right.

13:00.536 --> 13:02.118
But they would actually hide in graves.

13:02.759 --> 13:06.004
Oh, they hide... Talk about that incident.

13:06.344 --> 13:09.288
They had these big tombs that they buried their dead in.

13:10.069 --> 13:12.192
And, oh, they were everywhere.

13:12.212 --> 13:12.332
Right.

13:12.352 --> 13:14.234
In the side of these mountains or hills.

13:14.835 --> 13:22.545
And they were probably about four feet thick with concrete and steel on the top.

13:23.126 --> 13:24.668
But we...

13:25.019 --> 13:30.627
We had to actually get these Japs out of there because they had big walls running on the side.

13:31.287 --> 13:36.134
And then they had these here big blocks about a two by two, two feet by two feet.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.098
And they would be sealed, cemented in there.

13:39.539 --> 13:49.813
But whenever you, the Japanese started taking those out and taking the bones out of there and getting in there and using that as a cover.

13:49.833 --> 13:53.297
So we had to get them, you know, we had to get them out of there.

13:53.758 --> 13:53.878
Right.

13:54.027 --> 13:56.910
And I think you saw the other day on mine.

13:56.950 --> 14:00.294
I told you it was my turn to go in one of those one time.

14:00.314 --> 14:02.556
And I got down there real close to it.

14:03.137 --> 14:05.179
And I could see that it had been knocked out.

14:05.379 --> 14:10.965
And this little, there was about, you know, about a half or two, maybe three quarters of an inch across the top.

14:10.985 --> 14:13.908
And then I saw these eyes, you know, shining right at me.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.570
And I figured I was a goner.

14:15.590 --> 14:19.734
Because, you know, they're going to kick it over and start, you know, getting after you.

14:19.754 --> 14:21.756
But we had a,

14:22.208 --> 14:27.794
I had the other boy besides the three of us that made the regionals all the way through.

14:28.575 --> 14:37.004
But this John Kerry from Georgia was a boy that he wasn't afraid of the devil himself either.

14:37.645 --> 14:43.932
And he said, I started crawling and rolling and getting out of there because I figured he was going to mow me down.

14:44.573 --> 14:45.994
And he laughed.

14:46.015 --> 14:49.178
He said, hey, let me take care of this little chore.

14:49.630 --> 14:55.681
So he went down there, and luckily they were out of ammunition, or he probably wouldn't have made it back either.

14:56.182 --> 15:04.256
But he went in there, and he got those three, if I remember right, there were three Japanese soldiers in there, and we got them out.

15:04.396 --> 15:09.045
And contrary to the way they do today, there was no way we could take prisoners there.

15:09.465 --> 15:11.970
I mean, a lot of people think, oh, you've got to take prisoners.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.232
What are you going to do with them?

15:13.332 --> 15:14.254
You know, you had nothing...

15:14.572 --> 15:18.156
There's no place to, nobody to take them or keep them or whatever.

15:18.176 --> 15:21.179
So we just had to, they did us the same way.

15:21.199 --> 15:22.541
They just destroyed them right there.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.063
Exactly, exactly.

15:24.283 --> 15:28.908
And that was really, that was just day after day.

15:29.289 --> 15:34.014
You live from one minute to the next, not from one hour to the next, trying to survive.

15:34.074 --> 15:43.505
And on that particular time going north, many of our young men got killed by our own people for mistakes.

15:43.525 --> 15:43.785
Right.

15:43.867 --> 15:46.714
And that's why I think it helped me in my coaching when I got out.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.238
Mistakes will beat you.

15:49.060 --> 15:56.037
And so we were out one time there and our own planes come down and strafed us.

15:56.371 --> 16:08.922
And I don't see how in the world they kept killing every one of us because you could see the shells hitting the ground and we had nothing to get, no ditch to get in or no trees to get behind or anything.

16:09.503 --> 16:15.088
And it was, you know, really scary, but luckily I didn't get hit, but a lot of them did.

16:15.888 --> 16:25.517
And so, but that's just one instance that, you know, those big guns sitting out there 30 miles away, those big 16-inch guns, when they come over you and go,

16:26.155 --> 16:34.605
and they're trying to get them just over the front lines, maybe 50 yards or 100 yards, something like that.

16:35.166 --> 16:49.243
But if somebody back there on that ship didn't put the right amount of TNT behind it, or they didn't have exactly the right elevation, and all the communication had to be right, they might have wiped out, and in some instances it did wipe out

16:49.561 --> 16:52.004
a lot of people or a lot of our men.

16:52.905 --> 16:58.190
Let's look at some photographs right now from your service from your service time.

16:58.210 --> 17:05.818
We've got about a half a dozen pictures here and here's the first one there's a good-looking marine right there about how old were you then was that when you first went in?

17:05.858 --> 17:15.028
That's when I first got right after I got in and and right out of boot camp right right yeah and yes I didn't

17:15.245 --> 17:18.107
And that is another one about the same way.

17:18.668 --> 17:31.159
With some of the metals surrounding that picture, this is actually from a larger picture that you have hanging in your home that I believe your son Marty put together, sort of a collage of your World War II memorabilia.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.442
So talk about that picture.

17:34.462 --> 17:44.290
And I oversold with a sniper, but we trained on every weapon that the Marine Corps had so that we could fill in in Abel Company, Baker Company, and Charlie Company, that's what they call them,

17:44.658 --> 17:47.541
in the 1st Marine Regiment.

17:47.962 --> 17:52.568
And if they got, let's say they got four flamethrowers, that's what happened right off the bat.

17:53.108 --> 17:54.510
Four flamethrowers got killed.

17:55.051 --> 18:00.637
So they say, Adkins, Smith, Jones, and whatever, you know, be ready to move out in five minutes.

18:01.058 --> 18:02.039
We take their place.

18:02.860 --> 18:09.668
And so the first time we were up on the front line, we stayed up there, I believe it was about 21 days, something like that.

18:09.688 --> 18:10.990
You'd never change clothes.

18:11.010 --> 18:13.753
You was in the mud and everything and nothing.

18:14.155 --> 18:18.162
And if you can imagine having a cast on, you know, how it does your flesh.

18:18.983 --> 18:26.676
And so then they would take, they fixed these showers back behind, back behind the lines, maybe, you know, a few hundred yards.

18:27.297 --> 18:32.906
And we would, you cut your stuff off, your leggings and all that, you know, cut it off.

18:33.267 --> 18:38.716
And you took these showers, but, you know, your flesh was pretty, I still have a little problem with that.

18:38.756 --> 18:38.976
Right.

18:38.996 --> 18:40.078
You know, I mean, on you.

18:40.328 --> 18:50.279
But then about one or two days that issue your new clothes, new leggings, new shoes and everything, you go back up again.

18:50.459 --> 18:51.420
Yeah, do it again.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.502
You're right up on the front.

18:53.022 --> 18:59.049
Here's another picture with the... That gun right there is a 37 millimeter anti-tank gun.

18:59.249 --> 19:00.651
We knocked out tanks for that.

19:00.691 --> 19:02.112
We knocked the chains off of them.

19:02.833 --> 19:07.298
And we had some really... It's a high-powered...

19:07.683 --> 19:23.346
Also, we had canister we could shoot in that, and the canister in that gun was like a shotgun, big pellets, and it would mow down when these Japanese had those banzai charges.

19:23.486 --> 19:32.239
They'd just try to overrun you, and sometimes did, but we cut down a lot of them with that.

19:33.788 --> 19:37.052
That is my buddy, Hugh Tau, on our left.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.634
That's me on the right.

19:39.335 --> 19:48.968
And we had, this is once when we went back, like I told you, you know, back behind the lines, we played around a little bit.

19:49.108 --> 19:53.754
Hugh Tau was a Sunday school teacher from Seabree, Kentucky.

19:53.774 --> 19:56.238
And he was really a fine man.

19:56.298 --> 19:58.320
He was about six or seven years older than I was.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.403
He was in the Aleutian Islands.

20:00.873 --> 20:07.621
And he and I met up on Puvuvu Island when we were training in the South Pacific.

20:08.101 --> 20:10.104
And so we became very good friends.

20:10.184 --> 20:16.291
And after we got home, after we got married, we went to see each other.

20:16.411 --> 20:21.537
I'd go see him one year, he'd come see me the next year.

20:21.557 --> 20:21.937
Wonderful.

20:22.578 --> 20:30.407
This is a photograph of a group of you with a memorabilia from the war, a Japanese flag.

20:30.978 --> 20:35.462
You're the one standing behind the flag, we believe, in that picture.

20:35.742 --> 20:36.983
How do you remember that you came?

20:37.744 --> 20:43.289
Obviously, that was from either a Japanese soldier that you all killed or captured, I guess, right?

20:43.309 --> 20:53.878
Yes, I have a sword that was off one of their officers, and my son Marty's got that now, and I gave it to him.

20:54.179 --> 20:58.943
Also, I had three guns that we took off, you know,

20:59.227 --> 21:11.604
killed the Japanese, and I got them, and I know Marty's got one of them now, and it was a .25 caliber, that's what they were, that we took.

21:12.024 --> 21:23.320
Also, I killed another officer that had a camera, and so I took a lot of pictures with it, but didn't know if they would be any good.

21:23.820 --> 21:28.727
When I got back to the States, I did, and probably about 100 pictures,

21:29.180 --> 21:32.564
And a lot of those was in China where I took them.

21:32.584 --> 21:32.944
Right.

21:32.964 --> 21:36.989
And so after we left Okinawa after they dropped the bombs.

21:37.430 --> 21:50.725
So I took a lot of good pictures there and there's a lot of gruesome things in China that, you know, the way they did there, you had to belong to some something.

21:50.805 --> 21:56.212
You had to have a, you know, that you had a boss or a company that you worked for.

21:56.812 --> 21:56.933
Right.

21:56.953 --> 21:58.174
And if you were a

21:58.593 --> 22:02.118
kind of like our stray dogs and stray cats or whatever.

22:02.558 --> 22:06.764
If you were, didn't, wasn't documented and didn't have that, they rounded you up.

22:07.385 --> 22:07.505
Right.

22:07.525 --> 22:13.693
If nobody came to claim you, they would cut your heads off.

22:13.794 --> 22:15.215
And we went to one of those places.

22:15.316 --> 22:17.218
I even took pictures of it.

22:17.238 --> 22:25.950
Every week they had a, if nobody took care of it, they had a compound and they had them down on their knees and their hands behind their back and they tied them and

22:26.285 --> 22:29.248
And it just went, you know, I mean, they used a big machete.

22:29.268 --> 22:34.853
And I didn't realize that you could cut a person's head off or, you know, at the neck so easy.

22:35.754 --> 22:40.198
But those machetes, I guess, you know, that guillotine they used to have, you know, something like that.

22:40.219 --> 22:43.161
But this was pretty simple.

22:43.201 --> 22:44.823
But I can tell you one thing.

22:44.843 --> 22:46.104
You better be documented.

22:46.184 --> 22:52.090
And, you know, actually, they would actually, you could buy a girl for $3.00.

22:52.407 --> 22:54.009
And a boy cost you about $21.

22:54.090 --> 22:54.570
Wow.

22:56.133 --> 22:59.558
This is what you're talking about now is during the occupation time.

22:59.718 --> 23:01.220
We're going to talk about that.

23:02.342 --> 23:05.847
One of the hardest duties that you had in Okinawa is what you called outpost duty.

23:06.348 --> 23:07.470
And it was during the nighttime.

23:09.453 --> 23:10.495
Talk about that.

23:10.515 --> 23:14.821
And there was an incident involving that when you were in outpost duty.

23:15.222 --> 23:17.205
To what extent you want to talk about that also.

23:17.225 --> 23:21.351
But obviously that was one of the hardest and most dangerous duties that you had.

23:21.432 --> 23:22.254
We have a few minutes.

23:22.594 --> 23:23.156
Talk about that.

23:23.296 --> 23:23.957
Okay.

23:24.378 --> 23:41.213
Actually, probably the most dangerous thing was that you had to go out there, pick out six men, and each company would, but they'd send them out in front of the front lines.

23:41.648 --> 23:46.035
Actually, we had to get out there just about dusk and get situated.

23:46.055 --> 23:58.854
And so that we, when the Japsons started to come in, we could, we'd open fire and then our front lines would throw up flares and they could see and that helped them.

23:59.174 --> 24:02.739
We kind of, actually what it was is warning them before they got to them.

24:02.760 --> 24:02.880
Right.

24:02.900 --> 24:09.409
And so usually what the hardest part was, if you didn't get killed out there, is getting back.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.132
Because if you went back

24:11.787 --> 24:13.950
At night, your own men are going to kill you.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.873
If you go in daytime, the Japanese snipers are going to get you.

24:16.894 --> 24:17.675
Right.

24:18.035 --> 24:19.997
And this happened to a lot of young men.

24:20.158 --> 24:20.558
Right.

24:20.578 --> 24:32.694
And this one night, we were having a... Actually, I was on that 37-millimeter gun that you saw there a while ago, and we had a 100% alert.

24:32.874 --> 24:37.660
I wasn't out on the outpost that night, but I was behind the right wheel of that gun.

24:38.045 --> 24:42.650
And we dug in, dug deep, you know, I mean, our foxholes, one on each side.

24:43.230 --> 24:53.761
And then there was two, my buddy Hugh there was in underneath the, there was two men underneath that gun on, you know, where we had a tarp over it to kind of keep it from getting wet.

24:54.102 --> 24:55.684
So when we started firing it.

24:56.124 --> 25:04.172
And so that night, probably about two o'clock in the morning, and there was a little ridge about maybe 15 feet there in front of us.

25:04.192 --> 25:07.596
We always tried to get behind a ridge.

25:07.913 --> 25:09.034
where the line would go.

25:09.615 --> 25:18.746
And so about that time, this man come over that, you know, and I thought he was a Jap.

25:19.367 --> 25:20.449
You know, that's what he looked like.

25:20.489 --> 25:25.074
And he was kind of bent down and he just came over that ridge and coming right straight towards me.

25:25.715 --> 25:27.517
And so I shot him.

25:27.537 --> 25:28.459
Right.

25:28.479 --> 25:34.386
And I know that, you know, and so he fell in my foxhole with me.

25:34.406 --> 25:37.650
And I thought he was a Jap, see, all the time.

25:38.221 --> 25:48.732
And I knew that if that Jap wasn't killed or wasn't dead, that he would actually, they always strapped stuff, you know, explosives around them.

25:49.133 --> 25:51.741
And they had grenades and everything on them.

25:52.143 --> 25:55.467
but he was going to probably blow us both up, or, you know, me up.

25:56.048 --> 26:03.617
And so, but everything stood, sat real still, and he never did move, and I didn't move.

26:03.918 --> 26:07.883
And so I know my buddy Hugh was right there within two feet of me.

26:08.443 --> 26:18.316
He thought, he wasn't sure whether I was killed or whether the, you know, whether the Jap was still alive or what, because if he was, he'd be killing them too.

26:19.057 --> 26:21.880
So, but the next morning, uh,

26:22.433 --> 26:34.446
Actually, about daylight, I realized that there was a parka, you know, one of our parkas on this man, and he was one of our Marines that had been sent out.

26:34.466 --> 26:41.434
He was on one of them outposts down from another company, and he had been trying to get back.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.977
I knew this because they told me about it.

26:43.997 --> 26:49.403
He had been lost, but he was trying to get back to his outfit, but

26:49.838 --> 26:53.722
You know, he was always moving, you know, the line and everything.

26:53.762 --> 26:56.505
The line's going to be moving forward and that.

26:57.105 --> 27:00.208
But anyway, it really hurt me.

27:00.269 --> 27:11.380
And the colonel, they came up and got me, took me back, and the colonel talked to me, and he wanted to know how it was affecting me and if I thought I could continue to be, you know.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.885
And I certainly didn't want to pull back off the line because you might be put anywhere then.

27:16.905 --> 27:18.647
So I wanted to stay with my outfit.

27:18.863 --> 27:19.965
I told him I was fine.

27:20.386 --> 27:22.349
There wasn't anything I could do but what I did.

27:22.649 --> 27:22.990
Exactly.

27:23.010 --> 27:28.599
But this happened so many times, and it's either kill or be killed.

27:28.619 --> 27:31.764
That was what they put in our heads from the word go.

27:31.784 --> 27:31.905
Right.

27:31.925 --> 27:34.168
Kill or be killed and a one-way ticket.

27:34.449 --> 27:35.811
You didn't worry about coming back.

27:37.053 --> 27:37.835
Indeed.

27:37.895 --> 27:42.182
You were on the line, that outpost line, for 27 straight days, never took a shower.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.145
You were in battle for...

27:44.446 --> 27:46.973
the 81 days of the Battle of Okinawa.

27:47.454 --> 27:51.827
And you said that when you went in, you weighed 202 pounds, and when you came out, you weighed 146.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.356
We're out of time for this show.

27:55.437 --> 27:59.147
Next week, we're going to talk about, after the...

27:59.431 --> 28:06.780
The truce was signed, but the war still kept going on in occupation duty.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.063
And we're going to talk about some football next week.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.124
Thank you for being with us.

28:10.144 --> 28:10.585
That would be great.

28:10.605 --> 28:11.145
I appreciate it.

28:11.165 --> 28:11.446
Thank you.

28:11.466 --> 28:11.646
You bet.

28:12.147 --> 28:18.835
There is obviously more to tell of this remarkable career, the occupation of China when the war was over, but the fighting didn't really stop.

28:19.335 --> 28:21.338
And next week, we'll talk some football.

28:21.358 --> 28:25.523
So please join Coach Ray Adkins and me next week on Veterans of the Valley.

28:25.523 --> 28:33.000
[Silence.]

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
[Music.]
