00:00.031 --> 00:28.317
citizens.

00:30.372 --> 00:32.354
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.374 --> 00:33.345
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.051 --> 00:44.165
Duke Hobbs' career of service includes his stint with the 79th Infantry Division in Europe during World War II, but later in the Air Force, working reconnaissance in England during the Cold War.

00:44.706 --> 00:57.004
He's A&M class of 1947, but like so many of that time, his actual graduation was delayed a couple of years by his war service, a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge who recalls the unbearable cold of that winter of 1945.

00:58.205 --> 01:02.151
His recollections are sharper of the good times of the European campaign,

01:02.570 --> 01:10.491
like after Germany surrendered and his traveling variety show called You've Had It, Joe, where you might have sworn he was indeed one of the Andrews sisters.

01:10.953 --> 01:12.356
We'll explain that right now.

01:12.416 --> 01:14.622
Welcome to Veterans of the Valley, Duke Hobbs.

01:14.883 --> 01:16.126
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.490
That's a great story, Duke.

01:17.707 --> 01:21.411
First, I want to talk to you about how you remained in Texas.

01:21.472 --> 01:28.520
And it's a fascinating story because had it not been for a winter snowstorm in Rocky Mountains, you might have never come back to Texas.

01:28.540 --> 01:32.425
You might have been an Oregon boy, never been at A&M, never married Laura.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.047
It's funny how that worked out.

01:34.087 --> 01:34.888
Talk about that.

01:34.908 --> 01:35.889
Oh, that's true.

01:36.910 --> 01:41.256
I was 10 years old and my father died when I was three.

01:41.316 --> 01:44.980
My mother had remarried and my stepfather was an undertaker.

01:45.635 --> 01:57.352
And he owned a funeral home in Cherokee, Iowa, and sold it and built another funeral home in the central part of the state, closer to where my mother's family lived.

01:57.372 --> 02:01.357
And this was in the height, well, the early days of the Depression then.

02:01.798 --> 02:04.622
And he went broke.

02:05.108 --> 02:06.971
It didn't work out.

02:07.392 --> 02:15.305
We moved around the state, lived in three other places, three other towns after that, and never could get things going.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.974
He had a good friend from World War I days who lived out in Oregon.

02:20.954 --> 02:23.677
And he was also an undertaker.

02:23.697 --> 02:26.321
And so they got in touch with each other.

02:27.142 --> 02:31.928
And this fellow in Oregon asked him to come out there and join him.

02:31.968 --> 02:36.613
They'd form a partnership and a funeral home in some place in Oregon.

02:36.754 --> 02:36.954
Right.

02:36.974 --> 02:38.315
So this is in 1936.

02:38.856 --> 02:42.040
So we were going to go to Oregon.

02:42.060 --> 02:50.050
The problem, snowstorm hit the Rockies and completely blocked off the highways going through Colorado and Wyoming.

02:50.468 --> 02:58.055
So the only way he'd get to Oregon was to go south through Texas and out Highway 80 and then on up the West Coast.

02:58.095 --> 03:06.463
We got to Pecos, and we were eating all of our meals out on the highway, roadside parks, things like that.

03:06.483 --> 03:11.307
My brother and I thought it was just one consistent, continuous picnic all the way through.

03:12.028 --> 03:19.615
But anyway, we stopped in Pecos to get a dime's worth of paper plates for our next picnic dinner out in the desert.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.468
And while we were stopped there, there was a lawyer there in town who was originally from Iowa.

03:25.488 --> 03:29.514
He didn't see many Iowa license plates in West Texas in 1936.

03:29.834 --> 03:38.907
So he hailed my dad, and they started talking and found they had a number of mutual acquaintances.

03:39.789 --> 03:42.092
So anyway, he heard the story.

03:42.359 --> 03:52.856
and where he was headed and suggested that dad go across the street then to the Pecos Funeral Home or Pecos Furniture Store, which was owned by the same person who owned the Pecos Funeral Home.

03:53.858 --> 03:59.086
And ultimately, that man offered dad a job at the funeral home.

03:59.106 --> 03:59.607
He took it.

04:00.648 --> 04:03.293
And we lived in Pecos.

04:03.313 --> 04:07.660
So I graduated from Pecos High School seven years later when I was 17.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.062
Grew up in Pecos, Texas.

04:09.162 --> 04:09.683
That's right.

04:10.439 --> 04:15.023
You wanted to go to West Point, but you just couldn't find out a way to get there, how to get into West Point.

04:15.043 --> 04:17.125
So you figured you wanted to be in the military.

04:17.165 --> 04:18.547
You wanted to go to a military school.

04:18.607 --> 04:21.590
So Texas A&M was your next choice.

04:21.870 --> 04:22.350
That's right.

04:22.951 --> 04:26.054
You took the train from Pecos to College Station.

04:26.074 --> 04:27.996
You didn't like it at first, did you?

04:28.316 --> 04:30.598
The train ride was fine, but College Station, no.

04:32.180 --> 04:37.425
When we pulled into the railroad station on the old sunbeam,

04:38.857 --> 04:52.596
We saw a group, there were quite a few of us freshmen on that train, by the way, and that we saw a group of people standing outside and we assumed this was a nice welcoming committee and we thought that was a very, very nice thing for them to be doing.

04:53.032 --> 05:04.523
Well, it turned out this welcoming committee was made up of some upperclassmen who wanted to introduce themselves to their incoming fresh red meat, new freshmen for A&M.

05:04.703 --> 05:12.010
About the first month or four or five weeks or so, I absolutely detested it, every bit about it.

05:13.111 --> 05:18.356
And so I wrote to my mother and dad, told them that I had really made a mistake, I had to come back home.

05:19.657 --> 05:19.917
Well,

05:20.234 --> 05:23.077
In those days, there were no telephones on campus.

05:23.558 --> 05:26.541
And even if there were, I couldn't have afforded a phone call anyhow.

05:26.561 --> 05:30.966
So the letter was the only way of correspondence or communication period.

05:32.047 --> 05:33.128
They never answered the letter.

05:33.829 --> 05:35.651
So as a consequence, I couldn't go home.

05:35.671 --> 05:36.352
I had to stay.

05:38.074 --> 05:46.123
And after another month or so, I fell in love with the place and heaven's sakes, Texas A&M is

05:46.407 --> 05:48.830
Never been anything except heaven from that time on.

05:49.812 --> 05:51.794
It's meant an awful lot to you.

05:52.055 --> 05:52.755
I know that.

05:53.336 --> 05:55.379
Probably a good thing that your parents didn't write back to you.

05:55.419 --> 05:58.924
They probably said, hey, let him tough it out and we'll see if we get a second letter.

05:59.144 --> 06:01.067
I think it was a real blessing.

06:02.328 --> 06:08.196
You went into the Army in 1944 after your fish year like so many did of that time.

06:08.564 --> 06:16.511
El Paso and then the Camp Hood for basic training and where because of your military that you got into Texas A&M, you got to be a squad leader.

06:16.531 --> 06:19.574
You got the black armband, but you lost that black armband.

06:19.614 --> 06:20.134
Tell them why.

06:21.155 --> 06:30.423
Well, we were out on a night maneuver one night and I was to lead my squad across Cowhouse Creek and attack a stone building.

06:31.244 --> 06:34.947
Another squad of our platoon was to set up a base of fire in the back of it.

06:34.967 --> 06:37.930
Then we come across in a flanking attack and hit the building.

06:38.956 --> 06:40.838
Well, we crossed Cowhouse Creek, all right.

06:40.978 --> 06:42.139
Bear in mind, this is at night.

06:42.900 --> 06:47.884
And the second time we crossed Cowhouse Creek, I decided there was something wrong.

06:47.904 --> 06:52.589
About that time, we heard the firing of the other squad.

06:52.609 --> 06:53.330
We were lost.

06:54.731 --> 06:59.355
So needless to say, I lost my temporary stripes then.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.817
Your first demotion in the Army.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.417
That's right.

07:02.238 --> 07:06.482
Shipped off to Europe, and like so many, went from Boston to...

07:07.103 --> 07:08.805
We landed in Glasgow.

07:08.926 --> 07:13.212
Landed in Glasgow, and you went by an old luxury liner, the Ile de France.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.093
The Ile de France.

07:14.193 --> 07:23.207
I was one of the fastest ships afloat at that time, one of the largest luxury liners before the war, and sailed without an escort.

07:23.367 --> 07:23.968
Right.

07:23.988 --> 07:29.736
And we boarded the ship in Boston Harbor along about 6 o'clock or so one evening.

07:30.307 --> 07:32.611
And we were told that we'd be sailing that night.

07:34.194 --> 07:38.821
I got up the next morning and all of us, there were about 20,000 of us, by the way, on that ship.

07:39.783 --> 07:43.269
And we were stuffed into a place down in the hold.

07:43.950 --> 07:44.852
Got up that morning.

07:45.934 --> 07:47.917
The smell was terrible.

07:48.478 --> 07:49.480
Everybody was sick.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.867
And I went up on deck to try to get away from that horrible smell as quickly as I could.

07:54.573 --> 07:56.735
Turned out that we had not even left the dock.

07:56.775 --> 07:58.597
We were still tied up.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.798
So it was all psychological.

08:01.099 --> 08:03.341
Psychological warfare was already getting to you.

08:03.361 --> 08:03.781
That's right.

08:04.482 --> 08:04.982
Is that right?

08:05.643 --> 08:13.029
You landed in Glasgow and then you went to the southern coast of England and finally across the channel.

08:13.089 --> 08:22.758
Sort of talk about eventually joining up with the 79th Infantry Division, 314th Infantry, and sort of your travels after that.

08:22.778 --> 08:23.078
Okay.

08:23.733 --> 08:33.287
We landed at Le Harve and went through a couple of replacement depots, repo depots as they were called.

08:33.307 --> 08:45.084
And then the last one then, well, next to the last one, we went by train riding the old 40 and 8s from World War I days, as a matter of fact.

08:45.685 --> 08:46.927
Rode that across France.

08:46.967 --> 08:51.934
And then at the last replacement depot, we were assigned then, several of us,

08:52.775 --> 09:00.164
to the 79th, and the 314th specifically, so we boarded a truck then, and the truck took us on to our destination.

09:00.204 --> 09:08.415
Mine happened to be with Company F, the 314th, and they were located outside of Hagenau, France, in the Alsace-Lorraine area.

09:08.435 --> 09:08.695
Right.

09:09.496 --> 09:11.238
You were a ground soldier.

09:11.258 --> 09:13.561
You were an infantry soldier carrying a rifle.

09:13.701 --> 09:13.962
Right.

09:14.102 --> 09:16.104
You're, what, 19 years old?

09:16.124 --> 09:17.085
No, at that time I was 18.

09:17.106 --> 09:22.292
18 years old, from Pecos, Texas, one year at Texas A&M, and you find yourself

09:23.251 --> 09:27.538
in Europe on the ground, in the cold, fighting against Germany.

09:27.558 --> 09:28.801
That's right.

09:29.141 --> 09:31.405
What goes through an 18-year-old's mind?

09:31.465 --> 09:38.076
I mean, that's quite a shock, I guess, from one place to another.

09:38.097 --> 09:38.978
Were you frightened?

09:40.020 --> 09:43.406
Well, Tom, really, no.

09:43.506 --> 09:47.132
This is why 18-year-olds are the ones who fight wars.

09:47.753 --> 09:56.124
Because to an 18-year-old, he's immortal to begin with and has a protective shield around him.

09:56.144 --> 09:57.786
Nothing's going to happen.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.528
And so I really wasn't at that time.

09:59.548 --> 10:02.992
Now, later on, there were times when I certainly was.

10:03.012 --> 10:04.614
But at that point, though, I wasn't.

10:05.035 --> 10:06.116
It was brutally cold.

10:07.158 --> 10:08.639
And I remember that.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.483
And I remember the sounds of machine gun fire,

10:12.172 --> 10:13.494
both directions.

10:14.515 --> 10:27.232
And then we eventually were taken from Magana, moved from the 7th Army where the division was located at that time, on around to the 9th Army.

10:27.993 --> 10:31.297
And by around, it was around what then was the Bulge.

10:32.098 --> 10:42.111
And the mission of our division then was to come in helping to pinch off the Bulge then from the north as the 3rd Army was coming in from the south.

10:42.901 --> 10:51.550
So at that point, we were taking, now our first stop was in Nancy, France.

10:52.311 --> 10:58.197
And at that point, one thing I remember the most was listening to actually Sally on the radio.

10:58.898 --> 11:08.048
And we listened to her virtually every night we could if there was a radio anyplace because they played great music, good old American jazz and swing and so on.

11:08.872 --> 11:16.782
And Axis Hallett came on this one particular night, and she said, you boys in the 79th, put your Cross of Lorraine patches back on.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.204
You're in Nancy.

11:18.224 --> 11:19.146
We know where you are.

11:19.746 --> 11:20.567
We know where you're going.

11:20.587 --> 11:21.328
You're going north.

11:22.550 --> 11:26.595
And she hit her right on the butt, and that's exactly it.

11:26.615 --> 11:29.119
Could never imagine why their intelligence was so good.

11:30.601 --> 11:35.527
One of the biggest fights I know that you were involved in was at Campan, which is near the Roar River.

11:35.988 --> 11:36.128
Mm-hmm.

11:36.648 --> 11:39.111
to take over that river to open the paths to Cologne.

11:39.812 --> 11:43.617
Talk about that, and there was an incident there where you earned a bronze star.

11:43.738 --> 11:46.321
Talk about what happened and how that came about.

11:46.802 --> 11:51.708
Well, camping was quite a battle all right.

11:51.728 --> 12:04.225
And at one point, we were running low on ammunition, so our platoon leader asked for a volunteer then to go back to a regimental supply dump and to pick up ammunition to bring back.

12:04.880 --> 12:12.087
So I volunteered, and another fellow named Leo Lincoln from Los Angeles was in my squad as well.

12:12.748 --> 12:16.551
Leo volunteered, and the two of us headed on back then to do that.

12:18.093 --> 12:30.465
We'd been told that our weapons company was going to provide machine gun overhead fire to keep the Germans' heads down and give us protection as we were heading on back.

12:31.390 --> 12:34.236
Well, it had been rainy up until that day.

12:34.256 --> 12:36.059
And this particular day, the sun was out.

12:36.099 --> 12:38.223
It was a beautiful, sunshiny day.

12:38.243 --> 12:45.658
And for some crazy reason, we were walking down this muddy road singing Stormy Weather.

12:45.838 --> 12:48.063
They're, again, teenage kids.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.289
So we got about halfway

12:51.472 --> 13:00.746
back to regiment and suddenly dawned on us, the machine gun fire that we'd been hearing all the time was not friendly fire, not ours.

13:00.826 --> 13:04.311
This was German fire coming towards us.

13:04.331 --> 13:10.320
And we hadn't paid any attention to it before we'd heard the snaps and the cracks of the bullets as they went overhead.

13:10.340 --> 13:14.787
And when it dawned on us that this was German fire, we stopped singing.

13:14.807 --> 13:19.133
We went over to the sides of the road to get down as low as we could.

13:19.670 --> 13:26.659
and evidently they couldn't bring the elevation down low enough on the machine guns to touch it, so all was well.

13:27.320 --> 13:45.424
We got back to regiment, came back with the ammunition then, and it was after that then when I was put in then for the Bronze Star, and Leo was too for that matter, and for going back under, as they said, heavy enemy fire to pick up the ammunition.

13:45.590 --> 13:52.479
Later, March 28, 1945, you were not injured seriously, but indeed you were injured and earned a Purple Heart.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.022
Talk about that incident.

13:55.042 --> 14:05.235
This was shortly after we crossed the Rhine, and we were going through an industrial area someplace on the outskirts of Dewsburg.

14:05.873 --> 14:12.819
And Duisburg was at the north part of the Ruhr Valley, so the industrial heartland of Germany.

14:13.780 --> 14:20.086
And as we were going through there, the Germans set up a terrific artillery barrage.

14:20.987 --> 14:27.733
And generally, when they do something like that, they would also launch a counterattack then shortly after that.

14:27.753 --> 14:31.576
So anyway, we were given orders then to take cover.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.479
Didn't have to give us orders.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.880
We were ready to take cover anyhow.

14:36.518 --> 14:50.330
There was a bunker nearby, which I got into, and I was watching through a firing slit or a firing window on the side of the bunker and watching for the German soldiers coming towards us.

14:50.810 --> 15:05.563
I didn't see any, but while I was there in that position, though, an incoming shell, and you can always tell if they're coming in or not, the incoming shell hit, and I had ducked down, turned my head,

15:06.168 --> 15:10.013
And it hit right on that window that I was looking out of.

15:10.474 --> 15:16.862
And as a consequence, I had shrapnel on my back and got a cut up here on the side of my head by my eye.

15:17.904 --> 15:24.953
And so I was sent back to the first aid division, or division first aid, and then on back to the hospital.

15:25.557 --> 15:26.939
They thought I had a punctured lung.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.080
It turned out that it wasn't.

15:28.401 --> 15:32.627
And so after a couple of weeks, I was put back on a truck and headed back to the outfit.

15:32.747 --> 15:33.948
Headed back to action.

15:33.968 --> 15:43.762
We've got several pictures from, as a matter of fact, from this scrapbook right here that Mr. Hobbs had supplied us.

15:43.882 --> 15:44.823
We want to show them to you.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.005
And there they are right there.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.066
We start with that.

15:47.086 --> 15:47.947
When was this one taken?

15:48.848 --> 15:53.775
That was shortly after we reached the Ninth Army.

15:54.616 --> 16:02.946
And I've had a two-day pass, I guess it was, to the age Belgium, which was just a short distance off the lines at the time.

16:03.126 --> 16:04.388
That's why the big smile on your face.

16:04.848 --> 16:05.909
Big smile.

16:06.570 --> 16:09.834
Had some fresh coffee and donuts.

16:09.854 --> 16:11.556
That looks like a gung-ho soldier right there.

16:11.756 --> 16:15.040
That's a 60-millimeter mortar launcher.

16:15.481 --> 16:17.744
You were part of a mortar unit.

16:17.764 --> 16:18.064
Right.

16:18.304 --> 16:19.225
Well, mortar squad.

16:19.245 --> 16:19.746
Mortar squad.

16:20.317 --> 16:29.552
Each rifle company has three rifle companies and one weapons company that has mortars and machine guns.

16:29.973 --> 16:31.916
And I was in the mortar section there.

16:31.936 --> 16:33.479
Okay.

16:33.499 --> 16:33.939
Let's move on.

16:34.561 --> 16:40.891
This is Muster, Aggie Muster, 21 April 1946 in Frankfurt, Germany.

16:41.392 --> 16:41.532
Mm-hmm.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.352
Talk about that and who's in that picture.

16:43.372 --> 16:44.374
You're on the far left.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.017
Yeah, that's me on the far left.

16:47.699 --> 16:56.814
In the center, that picture doesn't show too well, the shadows, but that's Dwayne Bennett, who is a high school buddy of mine, also an Aggie buddy.

16:56.854 --> 16:58.056
We came to A&M together.

16:58.697 --> 17:03.705
And then on the right is another Aggie buddy, Melvin Maltz.

17:04.208 --> 17:08.051
Melvin and I have been close friends, lowlies many, many years.

17:08.071 --> 17:13.456
He and his wife Corky and my wife Laura and I get together quite often.

17:13.476 --> 17:15.578
Go to dinner and go to different things together.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.540
You've been a muster speaker last year in Midland.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.182
You spoke at the muster there.

17:20.562 --> 17:21.002
Right.

17:21.022 --> 17:23.945
Want to go on because we've got the program from the muster next.

17:23.965 --> 17:25.266
That's the program from that muster.

17:25.286 --> 17:25.946
You can see the date.

17:26.707 --> 17:28.969
21 April 1946, Frankfurt, Germany.

17:29.569 --> 17:30.931
Signature is on the front of it.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.552
And then we move to the next picture.

17:32.592 --> 17:33.793
We turn that around.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.462
This has got to be just a great possession of yours.

17:36.502 --> 17:41.450
The million-dollar signatures, I guess that's the signatures of most all who were present at that muster.

17:41.470 --> 17:42.211
Quite a few of them.

17:42.531 --> 17:43.172
Quite a few of them.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.716
Probably about half of them.

17:46.818 --> 17:48.080
Signatures in hometowns?

17:48.461 --> 17:48.601
Mm-hmm.

17:49.522 --> 17:51.065
That's got to bring back a lot of memories.

17:51.105 --> 17:53.008
Okay, let's move on.

17:53.048 --> 17:54.410
We've got some other pictures.

17:55.252 --> 17:57.435
That's a great program right there.

17:59.930 --> 18:00.631
When was this taken?

18:01.251 --> 18:04.474
That was just after I got back to Pecos after the war.

18:04.534 --> 18:05.035
After the war.

18:06.156 --> 18:06.296
Mm-hmm.

18:06.316 --> 18:08.758
Because you were there after the surrender of Germany.

18:08.858 --> 18:09.719
We'll talk about that.

18:09.739 --> 18:11.621
You stayed there for quite a while.

18:11.641 --> 18:15.564
And we're going to talk about the entertainment group that you were with.

18:15.604 --> 18:16.946
And I think we've got, there it is.

18:16.966 --> 18:18.087
There's the program from it.

18:18.147 --> 18:18.947
You've had it, Joe.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.449
We're going to talk more about this later.

18:21.129 --> 18:26.875
But after the surrender, you were part of a sort of a variety show that traveled around, right?

18:26.895 --> 18:27.035
Mm-hmm.

18:27.055 --> 18:28.196
That's right.

18:28.216 --> 18:29.397
First Division.

18:29.647 --> 18:44.852
set up that show it actually began as something that our battalion commander came up with to try to keep people occupied during the times they weren't doing close order drill during the post-war period.

18:44.932 --> 18:50.681
And your act was as part of the Andrews sisters and there you are proudly sitting on the far right.

18:50.701 --> 18:51.182
Right.

18:52.293 --> 18:54.395
Do you remember the other two Andrews sisters in the picture?

18:54.796 --> 18:55.657
Oh, yeah.

18:55.797 --> 18:57.479
The one in the center is Doc Klusinski.

18:57.519 --> 19:01.784
He was our medic and a great guy from Pennsylvania.

19:01.804 --> 19:07.530
And the guy on the left was called Stoop Herman.

19:07.550 --> 19:08.791
That's from a newspaper article.

19:09.092 --> 19:09.772
That's right.

19:09.792 --> 19:14.518
That picture comes from, a newspaper article about the traveling show and the variety show.

19:14.578 --> 19:16.680
And you all sang a great rendition of

19:17.133 --> 19:18.596
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, right?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.097
That's right.

19:19.117 --> 19:19.678
That's right.

19:19.938 --> 19:21.221
Just like the Andrews sister.

19:21.241 --> 19:21.982
That's a great picture.

19:22.483 --> 19:25.048
Except we used records, of course.

19:25.088 --> 19:26.811
It wasn't our own voices.

19:26.831 --> 19:27.853
That's right.

19:27.893 --> 19:31.420
This is your first day back from Europe.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.622
Was this taken in New York City?

19:32.923 --> 19:33.203
Right.

19:33.223 --> 19:35.908
That was at the Latin Quarter in New York City.

19:36.389 --> 19:39.355
And that was a very famous nightclub at that time.

19:39.375 --> 19:39.495
Right.

19:39.897 --> 19:47.966
And I'm on the left, and that's Lloyd Dawson, who was in my squad in combat in the center.

19:49.308 --> 19:54.394
And the one on the right, I can't recall his name at this point.

19:54.414 --> 19:57.717
He came into the outfit just in time to go back home again.

19:58.959 --> 19:59.279
All right.

19:59.600 --> 19:59.920
Let's move on.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.121
We've got a couple of more pictures.

20:01.141 --> 20:03.424
Here is the shadow box of your awards.

20:04.045 --> 20:11.878
And I know you're quite proud of all those, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart in the middle, but you told me that those are not really the awards that you're proudest of.

20:11.898 --> 20:15.344
Oh, I'm proudest of the one on top, the Combat Infantry Badge.

20:15.424 --> 20:15.664
Right.

20:16.025 --> 20:16.666
On the top right?

20:18.970 --> 20:19.891
No, the top center.

20:19.911 --> 20:21.494
Yeah, top center, of course.

20:21.514 --> 20:21.654
Uh-huh.

20:21.674 --> 20:21.834
Yeah.

20:23.016 --> 20:23.637
Quite impressive.

20:24.158 --> 20:24.779
Tell us about this.

20:26.101 --> 20:26.442
Well...

20:26.877 --> 20:34.305
After I'd been home for about seven months and six days, I received a check from Uncle Sam.

20:34.325 --> 20:34.946
Note the amount.

20:35.306 --> 20:37.769
This was 87 cents.

20:37.789 --> 20:39.531
This was my mustering out pay.

20:40.912 --> 20:43.936
It came a little bit late, my last paycheck.

20:44.016 --> 20:45.117
Final paycheck from the Army.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.740
Probably cost them a dollar to process this and mail it to you.

20:48.240 --> 20:48.781
Probably.

20:49.041 --> 20:49.882
87 cents.

20:49.902 --> 20:52.405
So the bureaucracy was working well even back then.

20:52.565 --> 20:53.406
Oh, absolutely.

20:53.926 --> 20:55.348
Absolutely.

20:56.442 --> 21:00.167
I think we've got a picture coming up here on the left.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.348
That is Laura.

21:01.929 --> 21:02.289
Right.

21:02.309 --> 21:04.672
You and Laura have been married over 60 years now.

21:05.033 --> 21:05.253
Uh-huh.

21:06.295 --> 21:08.497
Living here in Bryan College Station.

21:08.878 --> 21:09.579
College Station.

21:09.979 --> 21:10.660
College Station.

21:11.201 --> 21:14.645
That's you behind her whispering sweet things in her ear.

21:14.665 --> 21:17.268
This was when you were back at Texas A&M after the war.

21:17.329 --> 21:20.913
You were on a court trip to the A&M Rice football game in Houston.

21:20.973 --> 21:21.494
That's right.

21:22.055 --> 21:24.378
And this was at the Trianon nightclub down there.

21:24.538 --> 21:24.778
Right.

21:26.277 --> 21:27.760
And I think we've got a picture of wedding day.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.184
That would have been, what, Valentine's Day of 1948?

21:30.725 --> 21:32.168
Valentine's Day of 1948.

21:33.831 --> 21:34.913
She was my valentine.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.317
I usually say I was her valentine.

21:37.598 --> 21:38.179
And you still are.

21:38.539 --> 21:39.722
Oh, yeah.

21:40.643 --> 21:42.146
That's a great picture.

21:42.166 --> 21:47.295
You've written a book, along with our friend Benjamin Knox, who, of course, does the illustrations.

21:47.315 --> 21:48.878
I knew I was an Aggie Wynn.

21:49.219 --> 21:50.361
Talk to us a little bit about that.

21:51.235 --> 21:58.442
Well, first of all, the proceeds of it go to the Cushing Library, which was a library that we knew when we were in school here.

21:58.462 --> 22:00.884
And it's a great place to go.

22:02.226 --> 22:04.328
Wonderful artwork, things like that in the Cushing.

22:04.989 --> 22:15.058
And the book itself is a series of vignettes about different Aggies and stories that they've told then about when they first knew they were an Aggie.

22:15.078 --> 22:17.541
I know you're proud of that.

22:17.561 --> 22:17.841
Oh, yeah.

22:17.861 --> 22:19.082
It's kind of interesting to go through.

22:19.243 --> 22:19.723
You're proud of that.

22:20.041 --> 22:31.915
We're a little bit short on time, but we talked about after the war and you finally did come home, you re-enrolled in Texas A&M and graduated in 1949.

22:32.256 --> 22:35.540
And after that, you joined the Air Force for four years.

22:36.140 --> 22:36.921
Talk about your duty.

22:37.001 --> 22:39.544
It was during the Korean War, but you were actually assigned to England.

22:39.584 --> 22:41.026
Talk about your duty there.

22:41.086 --> 22:45.171
When I graduated from A&M, I was commissioned in the Air Force.

22:45.826 --> 22:49.691
So I ended up being assigned to Strategic Air Command.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.253
I was an intelligence officer.

22:52.054 --> 22:56.841
And we maintained a detachment in England.

22:56.861 --> 23:06.754
And we'd rotate crews and planes back and forth to this detachment in England, Scalthorpe, up near the Watch east of London.

23:06.953 --> 23:16.451
The operation eventually was photomapping Europe all the way from the Atlantic Ocean clear back to the Urals.

23:17.072 --> 23:28.655
Kind of interestingly, at the time that they were over the heart of Russia, Soviet Union, doing the mapping, we had a British crew trained and flying the airplanes, all of the American airplanes.

23:28.675 --> 23:29.957
We had six of them over there.

23:30.713 --> 23:38.968
had the British RAF bullseyes painted on them with the American Signet taken off, British crews flying them.

23:38.988 --> 23:48.024
So in the event that something went down, why this being the Cold War, early days in the middle 50s, they wouldn't be blaming us for it.

23:48.465 --> 23:49.988
Right, right, right.

23:50.677 --> 23:54.264
This was obviously pretty fascinating work, a lot of travel back and forth.

23:54.444 --> 23:55.766
Oh, yeah, very much so.

23:55.786 --> 24:02.679
And then after that, well, I was target intelligence officer in Goose Bay Labrador for the 8th Air Force then for a period of time.

24:02.699 --> 24:03.100
Indeed.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.483
So both Army and Air Force.

24:04.963 --> 24:10.794
I want you to talk about, of course, after you came back and joined the civilian life, I know you sold insurance for a while.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.297
You worked for Procter & Gamble.

24:12.277 --> 24:22.384
You and your wife, like I said, was married in 1948, went into the food brokerage business in Dallas, but finally made your way back to Texas A&M to teach management.

24:22.464 --> 24:24.790
Talk about that.

24:24.810 --> 24:27.838
When I retired from business in 1985,

24:28.460 --> 24:31.584
I was asked to come back to teach in the management department.

24:31.684 --> 24:39.756
Michael Hitt, outstanding man, asked me to come back and teach there, and so I did.

24:39.976 --> 24:45.123
Later on then, I became director of the Center for Executive Development, also in the College of Business.

24:45.664 --> 24:47.346
I was there for about five years.

24:47.326 --> 24:54.956
I retired from A&M in 1996.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.699
And kind of hard to remember there now.

24:59.061 --> 25:03.787
Continued teaching a leadership program on a volunteer basis for about five years.

25:03.807 --> 25:05.849
You volunteered because you didn't want to have to go to meetings, right?

25:05.870 --> 25:06.570
That's right.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.034
If they didn't pay me, they couldn't make me go to meetings.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.797
And that was a lot of fun.

25:12.157 --> 25:13.639
Thoroughly enjoyed being with the students.

25:13.860 --> 25:14.160
Indeed.

25:14.393 --> 25:15.214
Talk about your family.

25:15.374 --> 25:17.377
I know that you and Laura have four boys.

25:17.697 --> 25:17.998
Right.

25:18.298 --> 25:23.344
And two boys that went to the other school and twins that came to Texas A&M.

25:23.424 --> 25:23.925
That's right.

25:23.945 --> 25:26.108
Our two oldest boys became TSEPs.

25:26.128 --> 25:27.810
They were rebelling against the old man.

25:28.651 --> 25:32.356
And then the twins, the two youngest one, came to A&M.

25:32.376 --> 25:33.477
They graduated in 1984.

25:33.718 --> 25:37.262
And you've got three grandkids and four kids.

25:37.782 --> 25:39.124
For great-grandchildren.

25:39.905 --> 25:44.151
And some of them are fairly close to here, so I guess you get to see some of them sometimes.

25:44.232 --> 25:45.433
Oh, yeah.

25:45.533 --> 25:48.197
Yeah, we see some who live in Dallas.

25:48.217 --> 25:54.587
All of our grandkids and great-grandkids live in Dallas, except for one who lives in Columbus, Ohio.

25:54.607 --> 25:54.867
Right.

25:55.328 --> 26:01.096
And so we have one other son who lives in Austin and no children.

26:01.457 --> 26:02.198
Right.

26:02.218 --> 26:06.945
You look back at your service in the Army and the Air Force, your World War II service, I know that it's something that's

26:07.381 --> 26:09.564
that you're very proud of as all veterans are proud of.

26:09.584 --> 26:16.312
You look back of it, and what do you think now when you look back at that 18-year-old kid and what he did?

26:16.332 --> 26:24.682
Well, I guess probably the number one thing at this point is the fact that I'm glad that I went through it, but I certainly wouldn't want to do that again.

26:24.902 --> 26:25.302
Right.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.124
But I met some outstanding people.

26:27.265 --> 26:34.333
I think that my old company commander during combat I think was probably

26:34.634 --> 26:54.315
one if not the most outstanding person I've ever known, the things that he did for his troops, putting himself in a situation where he could easily have been killed just simply to keep the rest of us out of some of the extra things that could have happened.

26:54.716 --> 26:56.317
Duke Cobbs, thank you very much for your service.

26:56.337 --> 26:58.460
We're out of time, and I appreciate you joining us today.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.941
Thank you very much, Tom.

27:00.182 --> 27:00.642
Enjoyed it.

27:01.162 --> 27:08.736
And Aggie, through and through, Duke Cobbs was one of the many young teenage A&M freshmen who grew up quickly with a rifle and a duty in World War II.

27:09.217 --> 27:13.405
