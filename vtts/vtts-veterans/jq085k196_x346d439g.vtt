Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.342 --> 00:32.383
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.258 --> 00:44.753
World War II, of course, was fought primarily in Europe and the Pacific, but there was never any guarantee that the enemy from either side would not find its way to the United States shores.

00:44.773 --> 00:47.597
Frank Buell got permission from his mother to enter the U.S.

00:47.697 --> 00:48.978
Navy at the age of 17.

00:48.998 --> 00:54.425
That was in May of 1944, just 15 months before Japan surrendered.

00:54.445 --> 01:01.915
While waiting for an opening to go to flight school, he was assigned as a bombardier, flying B-24s and later PB-4Y-2s.

01:02.266 --> 01:12.122
Out of 24 crews, his was one of four assigned to stay stateside and train while at the same time guarding the East Coast from deployments, mainly in Florida.

01:12.603 --> 01:16.109
Please welcome Frank Buell to Veterans of the Valley.

01:16.129 --> 01:19.414
You're a 17-year-old kid and you were going into the Navy.

01:19.664 --> 01:22.348
You kind of grow up fast when you go straight into the service, don't you?

01:22.588 --> 01:23.329
Yes, you do.

01:24.130 --> 01:25.072
You learn in a hurry.

01:26.514 --> 01:32.643
But your mom had no qualms about go ahead and signing the permission and letting you join up at that time because there was a war going on.

01:32.663 --> 01:32.943
Right.

01:33.304 --> 01:44.119
I found out later that she hoped I'd go into the Army because she didn't like the Navy and she didn't like the Air Force.

01:47.339 --> 01:55.031
There's one irony in your story, as we talked about in the beginning, you flew on the B-24s and then later the PB-4Y-2s.

01:55.051 --> 02:00.940
You had previously worked at a company in Fort Worth and you were a Riveter and actually worked on those airplanes.

02:01.081 --> 02:01.622
Right.

02:01.642 --> 02:03.044
Consolidate Voltais.

02:03.064 --> 02:04.206
Right.

02:04.226 --> 02:07.471
And so that was ironic that you would later fly in those airplanes.

02:07.731 --> 02:08.372
That's true.

02:08.392 --> 02:10.596
I didn't ever expect that.

02:10.616 --> 02:15.203
Let's talk about your service and sort of when you went in and sort of how you got to

02:15.638 --> 02:19.843
to your final deployment or where you did deploy on the East Coast.

02:20.515 --> 02:24.159
We went to Jacksonville for boot camp.

02:24.539 --> 02:30.045
And then from there, we went to Memphis, Tennessee for Naval Air Technical Training Center.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.930
And I trained as an ordinance man and radar.

02:34.550 --> 02:38.835
And then from there, we went back to Jacksonville for gunnery school.

02:39.776 --> 02:43.741
And because I had a good record, they offered me bombardiers training.

02:44.601 --> 02:47.805
And so I went to bombardiers training.

02:48.427 --> 02:49.308
Cape Canaveral.

02:50.229 --> 02:54.495
And I offered to go to navigator school, but they wouldn't agree.

02:56.097 --> 03:05.228
And then we switched to training for development or going to squadrons for duty.

03:05.809 --> 03:17.944
Flying out of Miami Naval Air Station and flying down along the coast of Cuba and out south of Cuba on east to Puerto Rico and back through the

03:20.101 --> 03:22.084
Well, Bahamas.

03:23.425 --> 03:31.696
Let's talk about that aspect of service during World War II, because most of the people that serve in the war, you think of them as serving in the Pacific or the European theater.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.840
This was a very important aspect, obviously, of the war.

03:35.621 --> 03:42.029
Were you surprised that you were in the crew that was chosen to stay stateside, or were you figuring to go to the Pacific?

03:42.269 --> 03:43.871
We were expecting to go to the Pacific.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.935
We didn't know until we were all lined up and he

03:47.641 --> 03:56.851
told the crews that they would have 30 days leave on delay to San Diego to go to the Pacific.

03:56.891 --> 04:06.001
We were supposed to go to Rhoda in the Kwajalein Islands or somewhere in there.

04:06.021 --> 04:07.042
I've forgotten now.

04:07.463 --> 04:14.931
But at the end, he called off four crews and said that you're going to be going to the Atlantic.

04:15.856 --> 04:35.644
sent us to Norfolk, Virginia, and we stayed there for a while, and they transferred us to Eden, North Carolina, to a Naval Air Station, and went into Squadron 214, which flew the coastline shipping lanes, watching for submarines and weather.

04:36.365 --> 04:37.126
Talk more about that.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.448
What was the nature of your missions?

04:38.528 --> 04:43.696
I mean, you would go off, you wouldn't fly every day, but when you did fly, what was your job?

04:43.736 --> 04:45.238
What were you doing?

04:45.573 --> 04:51.566
We just cruised the shipping lanes and looked for problems, weather problems or what have you.

04:52.368 --> 04:58.241
And we usually went out for either four or eight hours.

04:58.261 --> 05:04.054
And occasionally we'd fly as much as 12 hours.

05:05.013 --> 05:19.176
longer trip, but we would have certain sectors to follow when we went out on, depending on who went on four or eight hours or whatever.

05:19.196 --> 05:26.548
And we'd fly, carry a lunch with us, carry a supper if we were going out at night.

05:27.001 --> 05:32.429
Well, you talked about looking for weather, and we'll talk about that in a minute because you flew into a couple of hurricanes, which got it kind of dicey.

05:32.449 --> 05:41.082
But as far as when you say looking for other problems, looking for enemy, looking for, as a matter of fact, German submarines.

05:41.102 --> 05:42.524
As a matter of fact, one popped up one time.

05:42.584 --> 05:42.825
Yes.

05:43.386 --> 05:43.646
Right?

05:43.786 --> 05:46.290
Right off the coast where we're going to bombardier school.

05:47.071 --> 05:52.900
One came up one day, and before we could get a bomb loaded on a plane, he disappeared again.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.624
They never did spot him after they went out looking for him.

05:55.744 --> 05:56.265
Right.

05:57.275 --> 05:58.536
Yeah, it scared us to death.

05:58.857 --> 06:02.560
We had to do guard duty on the beach every night.

06:03.201 --> 06:19.517
Some had, let's see, we went on for four hours, four-hour shifts, and walked the beaches carrying a rifle over our back, and that was sort of scary, too.

06:19.537 --> 06:21.319
We think of all sorts of things happening.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.321
Exactly, exactly.

06:23.842 --> 06:27.045
You flew down, I know, to Cuba, and there was some reconnaissance there because

06:27.363 --> 06:31.549
that's where some of the submarines were getting refueled and things like that, is that right?

06:31.569 --> 06:44.109
Yes, they had some creeks or little rivers where they'd run in under trees and do some stuff up in the trees to hide the submarine.

06:44.910 --> 06:52.342
And they stored gasoline or fuel oil there and whatever food they needed and things like that.

06:52.362 --> 06:53.944
And they'd run out and catch the

06:54.363 --> 06:56.126
ships in the shipping lane.

06:56.507 --> 07:01.595
As a matter of fact, the only ship I ever sunk was one that had been hit by a torpedo.

07:02.677 --> 07:14.818
And they called us when we were out on one of our flights and asked us to bomb a ship that had sunk down just almost to the level of their deck.

07:15.136 --> 07:21.305
They had had some ammunition and stuff stored on it, shipping it to England.

07:21.746 --> 07:30.118
And they asked us to bomb it and sink it because they were afraid to go back on board after the crew had left.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.420
Now where was this?

07:32.342 --> 07:37.389
That was in just off Jacksonville, northern Florida.

07:37.910 --> 07:41.555
So that was the ship that you saw?

07:41.715 --> 07:43.438
Yes.

07:43.418 --> 07:46.182
cargo ship loaded with ammunition.

07:46.523 --> 07:52.011
I bet you can remember that day when you dropped the bomb that sunk the ship, right?

07:52.031 --> 07:52.291
Right.

07:52.411 --> 07:54.714
I dropped four right across.

07:55.035 --> 07:56.597
Did you get them with all four?

07:57.198 --> 07:57.378
No.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.965
One hit the ship, one hit right alongside the others.

08:01.985 --> 08:02.906
But you did the job.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.148
Yeah.

08:04.789 --> 08:05.710
Talk about the aircraft.

08:06.071 --> 08:08.835
The B-24, obviously a very high profile.

08:09.035 --> 08:20.733
aircraft of World War II, and then sort of following it, a very similar airplane, the PB4Y2, which is also called the Privateer.

08:20.793 --> 08:21.034
Yes.

08:21.214 --> 08:22.856
What are the differences between the two planes?

08:22.977 --> 08:25.080
And talk about the B-24 first.

08:25.100 --> 08:25.380
Okay.

08:28.705 --> 08:31.550
I don't even remember now how long the B-24 was.

08:31.750 --> 08:31.951
Right.

08:34.274 --> 08:38.080
It was probably

08:39.157 --> 08:42.301
50-something feet long, somewhere in that neighborhood.

08:45.264 --> 08:55.236
Wings were about probably 24 feet each way, and it had the twin rudders.

08:55.477 --> 08:58.620
That's what's very distinctive about it is the twin rudders.

08:58.861 --> 09:00.302
We'll see a photograph here.

09:00.643 --> 09:03.426
They had a nose and tail turret, and one

09:03.811 --> 09:06.555
top turret and belly turret.

09:07.517 --> 09:10.502
And then you could fire machine guns out the side windows.

09:11.203 --> 09:20.858
And on the PB4Y2, it was designed to be eight feet longer to leave additional room for

09:21.935 --> 09:28.165
radar bombing gear and some other gear that they needed to put in for long patrols.

09:28.246 --> 09:29.387
It had six turrets, right?

09:29.548 --> 09:34.997
It had six turrets, one in the nose, two on top, one in the tail, and two on the side.

09:35.979 --> 09:43.010
And they would sweep all the way down and cross about 40 feet under the plane, crossfire.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.997
So it was much better equipped for patrol.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.221
And its tail or rudder was the more traditional.

09:49.241 --> 09:51.005
Yeah, it was a single tail.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.890
Right, right, right, right.

09:53.910 --> 09:57.437
You liked the PB better, right, as far as the job that you had to do?

09:58.318 --> 09:58.919
Particularly.

09:59.200 --> 10:04.530
And the nose, well, the nose turret was...

10:05.101 --> 10:14.332
a round turret that could go, in the B-24, the turret could only raise the guns up and down, and it turned sideways.

10:14.392 --> 10:19.257
So you had trouble tracking a plane coming down across.

10:19.277 --> 10:29.929
But you could, in the PB-4Y-2, the round turret, the guns moved with the turret, and you could go anywhere you wanted to with it.

10:29.949 --> 10:34.855
And if you tracked a plane down and under or something like that,

10:35.324 --> 10:39.031
you'd wind up not knowing where you were.

10:39.552 --> 10:44.501
And usually the plane would turn when we were practicing that.

10:45.943 --> 10:53.236
Turn away or turn into a plane that was coming towards us and give more guns an opportunity to fire at it.

10:53.377 --> 10:59.087
But the gunner in front would

10:59.573 --> 11:01.241
get lost sometimes.

11:01.261 --> 11:06.866
And he could look around, couldn't see the airplane behind him because he was facing away from it.

11:07.529 --> 11:08.453
And he'd have to just

11:09.648 --> 11:16.616
run his turret around to see until he saw some part of the plane and then line it up.

11:17.057 --> 11:24.625
I know you told me in the Navy that your missions were mainly single plane patrol bombing missions.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.207
We never went double.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.108
We always went single.

11:27.949 --> 11:32.094
And you usually stayed under 5,000 feet or around 5,000 feet or even lower?

11:32.114 --> 11:33.415
Generally we were around 5,000.

11:33.976 --> 11:35.638
If we were running a

11:36.057 --> 11:41.142
bombing run or something like that, we'd go in lower because it was easier to hit the target.

11:41.262 --> 11:41.702
Right.

11:41.942 --> 11:47.968
You said sometimes you'd be so low, you'd just be right over the wavetops because the submarines had a harder time seeing you that way, right?

11:47.988 --> 11:56.195
We had an altimeter setting in the bombardier's compartment and the pilot had his above.

11:56.876 --> 12:05.203
And before we flew a flight, I always had to go check the pilot's deal and set ours seven feet below.

12:06.398 --> 12:13.209
His was up on the dash, and mine was down on the floor to the side.

12:14.130 --> 12:17.715
One day we went out flying, and I forgot to set mine.

12:18.677 --> 12:29.053
And we were flying along for a practice run, bombing run, and I said, could you put it down a little lower?

12:29.253 --> 12:31.056
I said, you're up above 100 feet.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.455
Let's go down a little lower.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.117
And so he dropped it down.

12:36.038 --> 12:40.463
The water started blowing up on the bombardier's deal.

12:40.884 --> 12:45.930
And I looked over at mine and it still showed that we were above water.

12:46.411 --> 12:48.934
No, it showed that we were below water.

12:48.954 --> 12:50.095
It hadn't been set.

12:52.138 --> 13:00.248
But we were close enough so that the wind was blowing the water off the wavetops and catching the nose of the plane.

13:00.308 --> 13:01.009
Right.

13:01.478 --> 13:03.221
Most of the time, water on the windshield is rain.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.125
This was ocean water coming back.

13:07.928 --> 13:15.580
Most of your missions, thankfully, I would imagine were mostly routine, but there are some that were far from routine, and you told me about a couple of them.

13:15.961 --> 13:22.391
First one I want you to talk about is the time that you flew into a hurricane.

13:23.973 --> 13:29.562
Actually, the Navy had never flown into a hurricane before, and they had heard about it.

13:30.672 --> 13:35.519
an army, B-17, that had flown into a hurricane and reported the weather.

13:35.960 --> 13:46.717
And so they alerted us that any time a hurricane was coming up or any of the ships reported hurricanes or something like that, that they wanted us to fly into it if we were close to it.

13:46.877 --> 13:52.866
So they sent us the message over the radio that there was a hurricane just south

13:53.470 --> 13:55.794
east of Cuba or just south of Cuba.

13:56.715 --> 14:03.767
And so we flew down and were circling with the wind and going into it.

14:03.787 --> 14:10.158
And at first it seemed not too bad as we got into it a little deeper though.

14:11.059 --> 14:15.226
Sometimes we'd just drop about 100 feet or 150 feet.

14:15.707 --> 14:18.752
First thing you know, we'd shoot up 100, 200 feet.

14:19.407 --> 14:22.873
And it really got scary.

14:22.893 --> 14:24.515
Several of us got sick.

14:24.535 --> 14:29.784
And with 12 members of crew there that smelled things up pretty bad.

14:31.527 --> 14:38.097
But we did go into the eye of the hurricane and then flew right back out again.

14:38.158 --> 14:41.623
And it was just as bad coming out as it was going in.

14:41.643 --> 14:45.229
But I don't know what the winds were because our

14:45.513 --> 14:47.516
equipment wouldn't measure them.

14:47.536 --> 14:48.036
Right.

14:48.057 --> 14:49.358
It didn't go high enough.

14:49.899 --> 15:02.817
And, uh, but, uh, we did circle all the way around it then and flew back in and we didn't suffer any damage, but it was just rough, really rough, really rough.

15:02.837 --> 15:06.222
You said that was the second most scared you've ever been in a little while.

15:06.242 --> 15:10.828
We'll talk about the time that it was the most scared that you were in your mission.

15:10.848 --> 15:13.832
Let's go to some photographs right now out of an album that you, uh,

15:14.437 --> 15:18.701
you gave us, Frank Buell, and this is you and Gloria.

15:19.542 --> 15:20.542
Yes, that's my wife.

15:20.683 --> 15:21.383
On wedding day.

15:21.403 --> 15:24.566
And that was in 1952.

15:24.686 --> 15:25.207
Right.

15:26.188 --> 15:27.649
We were married.

15:28.029 --> 15:33.494
I met her in probably October of 51.

15:34.175 --> 15:34.835
Right.

15:35.356 --> 15:36.697
When you all were at North Texas State.

15:36.717 --> 15:38.018
We were at North Texas.

15:38.038 --> 15:42.402
I was working on my master's and she was working on her doctorate in library service.

15:43.006 --> 15:50.795
And we, a friend of mine said, Dave, you would like to go to the ball game this afternoon?

15:50.815 --> 15:53.939
I said, sure, Saturday afternoon had a football game.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.703
And he said, how about a blind date?

15:57.863 --> 16:01.508
I said, great, sure, I'm up for a blind date.

16:01.588 --> 16:04.491
He said, well, I know a girl over at one of the dormitories

16:04.876 --> 16:08.079
I'll call her and ask her if she's got a roommate or a suite mate or something.

16:08.159 --> 16:23.955
So she had a roommate and we agreed to pick them up at the proper time and went over and I parked my car and we walked up to the dorm and they were coming down some steps.

16:25.176 --> 16:31.322
And Gloria was 5'10 and I was a little over six.

16:31.842 --> 16:52.737
feet but she just kept coming down the stairs and coming down the stairs before we saw her face and i thought man that's the girl that's the one and so we met out in the outside of the dorm she introduced her girlfriend to both of us

16:53.122 --> 16:59.531
He introduced me, or he'd introduced me to her, and then she introduced her girlfriend to both of us.

16:59.771 --> 17:04.839
We talked just for a minute, and I just reached over and took Gloria by the elbow and said, shall we go?

17:05.319 --> 17:06.561
And just walked off with her.

17:07.462 --> 17:10.967
So you hadn't been paired up yet, but you made sure the pairing was what you wanted, right?

17:11.047 --> 17:12.149
That's right.

17:12.309 --> 17:15.093
And he didn't like it at all.

17:15.554 --> 17:17.256
And here's some 57 years later.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.674
You still got her by the arm, right?

17:19.795 --> 17:20.115
Right.

17:20.135 --> 17:20.736
And here we go.

17:21.718 --> 17:23.642
Let's go to some more photographs here.

17:24.103 --> 17:24.965
You're not in this picture.

17:25.005 --> 17:27.149
This is part of the crew, I guess.

17:27.329 --> 17:38.511
Yeah, there's the master mechanic and the middle one is radio operator and the one on the right is also a radio operator.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.054
Right.

17:41.452 --> 17:45.355
We had a bunch of pictures like this in different places.

17:46.797 --> 17:48.198
But that's the way we went.

17:48.778 --> 17:49.539
Dungarees.

17:50.039 --> 17:50.780
Right.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.902
Now here is the privateer.

17:53.142 --> 17:54.163
Yeah, here's the privateer.

17:54.423 --> 17:56.505
This is the BB-4Y2.

17:57.286 --> 18:02.510
And in the nose, that's where the front gunner is, right?

18:02.530 --> 18:03.371
Yes, right.

18:03.611 --> 18:05.373
And you're actually down below that.

18:05.433 --> 18:08.976
You can sort of see the shine of the windshield where the bombardier is.

18:09.336 --> 18:10.497
That's pretty tight quarters.

18:11.185 --> 18:16.914
You have to crawl in and stay down because you can't stand up in there.

18:16.934 --> 18:19.938
That's not enough room.

18:19.958 --> 18:28.131
And the white deal down underneath was our radar gear that we tracked planes with.

18:28.533 --> 18:32.138
Got another photograph of the same type of airplane.

18:32.398 --> 18:32.979
Oh, that's the B-24.

18:32.999 --> 18:33.920
This is the B-24.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.284
Right, right, with the double tail.

18:36.884 --> 18:40.790
We flew B-24s until the PB-4Y2s came out.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.572
Right, right.

18:42.592 --> 18:50.423
This is a photograph that I actually got off of the internet, which was a good in-flight picture of the B-24.

18:50.858 --> 18:55.547
And now here's another picture from your album, I believe, of B-24 that was actually in your group.

18:55.667 --> 18:56.608
Right.

18:56.628 --> 19:01.117
That was in training going squadron duty.

19:01.137 --> 19:03.060
Right, right.

19:03.080 --> 19:03.220
Yeah.

19:03.241 --> 19:03.441
Okay.

19:04.302 --> 19:04.723
Next one.

19:05.124 --> 19:06.246
This is a group.

19:06.927 --> 19:12.437
That was a bombardier school, and that was a bunch of the guys that were in bombardier training.

19:12.998 --> 19:13.980
Right, right.

19:14.332 --> 19:20.183
And Frank, is the back row just almost right in the middle, the tall, skinny guy that's dead center?

19:20.203 --> 19:20.865
Yeah, dead center.

19:21.085 --> 19:21.606
You're standing.

19:21.626 --> 19:25.213
No, just to the left of the front center line.

19:25.233 --> 19:25.494
Right.

19:25.674 --> 19:28.880
You're standing to the left of the guy with his hat that's cocked there.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.363
That's you right there.

19:31.766 --> 19:32.107
Okay.

19:32.207 --> 19:32.307
Okay.

19:34.244 --> 19:35.486
You're on the right on this picture.

19:35.506 --> 19:36.128
I'm on the right.

19:36.729 --> 19:40.195
Crawford in the middle and Briggs on the left.

19:40.496 --> 19:41.718
Where was this taken, do you recall?

19:43.461 --> 19:44.243
It's been a few years.

19:45.505 --> 19:47.629
It was one of our...

19:48.115 --> 19:50.479
crew deals that I don't remember exactly.

19:50.719 --> 19:51.460
Right.

19:51.821 --> 19:52.201
Right.

19:52.221 --> 19:53.623
You were at ease, we'll say that.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.206
We were at ease.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.130
You should see some of the pictures we had.

19:58.451 --> 20:00.073
Well, you saw some of them.

20:00.093 --> 20:01.636
Yeah, I did, but you were really at ease.

20:01.856 --> 20:02.177
Yeah.

20:02.197 --> 20:03.679
And there again, I'm dead center.

20:03.799 --> 20:04.620
Yeah, in the top row.

20:04.721 --> 20:06.764
Yeah, top row.

20:06.784 --> 20:08.286
Section G of class G8.

20:08.767 --> 20:08.967
Yes.

20:09.047 --> 20:10.049
This is from your... Memphis.

20:10.570 --> 20:10.830
Right.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.773
Naval Air Technical Training Center.

20:14.238 --> 20:19.332
Let's talk about the other time that was a rather dicey moment.

20:19.352 --> 20:28.939
This one really was, and it involved a flight where your normal pilot was on leave for personal reasons.

20:29.240 --> 20:36.010
And so another copilot had been brought in and they were being trained to go from the B-24 to the PB-4Y-2.

20:37.012 --> 20:41.639
And the copilot who was in charge pretty much a kind of lost control.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.261
Talk about what happened.

20:44.563 --> 20:48.008
We were doing various activities or various

20:49.507 --> 21:19.446
motions to show how the plane handled different from the B-24 and he was having us to do a 60 degree bank and we went up in the bank and the co-pilot froze the controls and the test pilot from Consolidated Vaultee that had tested the planes whacked him in the head I don't know whether it was his fist or something and knocked him cold and

21:19.932 --> 21:33.390
The next thing I heard, and I was in the rear of the plane listening to give them responses on conditions, and I heard him say, damn it, push the nose down, damn it, push the nose down.

21:33.410 --> 21:37.315
And then they whacked him, and we rolled over on our back.

21:37.936 --> 21:46.868
And the plane dropped off and started spinning around upside down with one wing lower than the other.

21:47.742 --> 21:55.538
And we had been told that if we ever went into a spin, that we would only last about two turns, two complete spins.

21:56.019 --> 22:01.570
Well, I counted that and it was gone before we ever got over.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.895
But the pilot finally got the plane

22:04.735 --> 22:07.058
over so that he got it going nose down.

22:07.719 --> 22:16.431
And we lost about 8,000 feet and cleared off about, probably about 400 feet.

22:17.733 --> 22:24.302
And he knew the plane wasn't flying right and so he just flew it right into the base and landed.

22:24.322 --> 22:30.270
We were just probably five or six miles out from the base.

22:31.852 --> 22:34.135
It was a scary moment and the pilot didn't

22:34.604 --> 22:38.450
Didn't credit his own skill for most of that when you got on the ground, right?

22:38.470 --> 22:44.499
We got on the ground and he got out and he said, okay, guys, let's kneel and pray.

22:44.519 --> 22:47.303
And one of the guys said, why, we're down.

22:47.684 --> 22:52.451
And he said, we need to thank God we're down because I didn't have control of that plane.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.254
He said, God had it.

22:54.334 --> 22:59.622
And he said, all I did was to hold it for landing.

22:59.802 --> 23:02.586
When it was on approach at about 400 feet.

23:02.802 --> 23:04.724
That's all he had control of it.

23:05.806 --> 23:06.306
That's right.

23:06.467 --> 23:10.031
As far as getting it on course, aiming nose to the runway.

23:10.051 --> 23:11.994
That's right.

23:12.014 --> 23:16.179
We just happened to be lucky to be right front on into the runway.

23:16.419 --> 23:16.920
Right.

23:16.940 --> 23:18.301
And it just came in, landed.

23:18.662 --> 23:18.922
Right.

23:18.942 --> 23:24.209
And when we looked at the airplane, the rudder was bent over about 10 degrees.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.493
And there are parts of the tail and...

23:28.047 --> 23:30.930
at one of the ailerons missing off the plane.

23:31.290 --> 23:32.912
It had really been through it.

23:34.393 --> 23:39.399
There was another time, Tripp, I think back from or to Puerto Rico, you said that a couple of engines went out?

23:39.879 --> 23:40.700
Yeah.

23:41.861 --> 23:42.882
We were flying, yes.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.263
We were flying back in.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.426
One engine went out.

23:47.227 --> 23:49.969
It had an oil leak or something went out.

23:50.210 --> 23:53.633
And then as we turned to come back towards home,

23:54.102 --> 23:57.546
another engine developed a heating problem, and it went out.

23:57.647 --> 24:16.431
They're both on the same wing, and so we were flying along sort of lopsided, but we flew into the Bahamas just before dark, and the British had an air base there, and

24:16.478 --> 24:20.602
but they had closed their base down at supper time.

24:21.663 --> 24:40.123
And so we came in over the island with a guy up front shooting a blinker gun, signaling, and the guy up on top of the eloping compartment there, and he was firing rockets out.

24:40.492 --> 24:45.222
Then the radio operator was calling SOS, SOS, we need landing.

24:46.584 --> 24:50.953
And we went over.

24:50.973 --> 24:57.707
NASA flew, and the pilot said, well, fellas, if we don't make it this next time,

24:58.362 --> 25:00.344
we're having to go in the ocean.

25:00.364 --> 25:07.553
And so he turned and we came back in and the lights came on just as we got over the island.

25:07.733 --> 25:16.263
And it turns out a guy had just come out of a club from having his last beer, saw you all flashing at him, and he rushed over and turned on the lights.

25:16.403 --> 25:18.025
And he ran over and turned on the lights.

25:18.065 --> 25:19.507
I'm glad he didn't order one more beer.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.530
That might have been a problem.

25:22.510 --> 25:26.096
Frank, we've just got a couple of two and a half minutes left or so.

25:26.577 --> 25:28.440
And you got out in June of 1946.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.962
You were 20 years old.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.725
You went into education.

25:31.745 --> 25:35.291
You went to North Texas and got your degree.

25:35.311 --> 25:38.055
And eventually you got a doctorate, I know, and all that.

25:38.272 --> 25:40.155
You were in Carrollton for 20 years teaching.

25:40.175 --> 25:41.236
Yes, teaching.

25:41.256 --> 25:42.658
Well, I taught all the way through.

25:42.678 --> 25:47.645
I was there 20 years, but I held almost every position in the school district.

25:47.665 --> 25:50.169
And when I left, I was acting superintendent.

25:50.189 --> 25:51.170
You taught at TCU.

25:51.230 --> 25:56.498
You were an instructional consultant all over Texas after actually retiring at the age of 57.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.503
You met your wife, Gloria, at North Texas.

26:00.523 --> 26:04.229
You have a daughter, Becky, and you have three grandchildren.

26:04.249 --> 26:04.429
Yes.

26:05.010 --> 26:06.692
But one of your grandchildren, Wendy,

26:06.976 --> 26:09.580
And also wanted to mention, you have a daughter, Becky.

26:09.620 --> 26:12.924
You and Gloria also had a foster child, a daughter.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.487
Right, Mary.

26:14.887 --> 26:17.711
Mary, who sadly you had to give back to her mother when she was young.

26:18.412 --> 26:24.501
But you have a granddaughter, Wendy, and tell us in about a couple of minutes, if you can, about how you came by Wendy.

26:25.882 --> 26:30.609
Jessica is our granddaughter, and she was in the Girl Scouts.

26:30.629 --> 26:36.257
And so the church here in town was sponsoring the

26:37.553 --> 26:39.598
orphanage in El Salvador.

26:40.152 --> 26:45.458
And they got the girls to make up Christmas boxes for the kids.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.381
And they got to look at kids' pictures.

26:48.162 --> 26:51.385
And Jessica picked a cute little girl named Wendy.

26:52.186 --> 26:53.988
And she made up a box for her.

26:54.008 --> 26:57.853
And she stuck a picture of her and a letter and a Christmas card in it.

26:58.754 --> 27:03.740
And then several months later, along in the spring, Steve was a builder.

27:03.800 --> 27:08.826
And they went out to see the building or builder supplies at the Brazos Center.

27:09.447 --> 27:24.773
and different things that were there about construction and building and he took Becky and Jessica with him and they walked down through the deal looking at things he was interested in I guess and Wendy saw the

27:25.664 --> 27:28.488
church deal there.

27:29.169 --> 27:34.357
And up on top of some boxes was a picture of Wendy.

27:35.839 --> 27:38.984
And she was holding Jessica's picture on her chest.

27:39.625 --> 27:44.852
And so they looked at that and they thought, gosh, what a pretty little girl she was.

27:45.854 --> 27:50.521
And they got to talking about it and you suppose we can adopt her.

27:51.021 --> 27:53.545
We'd be glad to take another child.

27:53.930 --> 28:03.426
And it turns out that after a long, long process that took a few years, it's a great, great story, but three years that they brought Wendy home.

28:05.709 --> 28:13.522
They came to our apartment, and Jessica came running in with Wendy, and Wendy just ran to us.

28:13.542 --> 28:14.524
Abuelo, abuela.

28:15.405 --> 28:16.527
Grandfather, grandmother.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.250
How old is Wendy now?

28:18.584 --> 28:20.787
She's 10 now.

28:20.807 --> 28:20.988
10?

28:21.088 --> 28:21.248
Yeah.

28:21.649 --> 28:23.091
That's a wonderful story.

28:23.111 --> 28:23.211
Yeah.

28:23.231 --> 28:24.152
That's a wonderful story.

28:24.172 --> 28:27.257
I know you love all your grandchildren, but that's a wonderful story.

28:27.277 --> 28:28.238
She's quite unusual.

28:28.278 --> 28:30.261
She's special, bringing her from El Salvador.

28:30.682 --> 28:31.764
We're out of time.

28:31.784 --> 28:34.688
Thank you for being with us, and thank you for your service.

28:34.708 --> 28:35.189
Enjoyed it.

28:35.289 --> 28:35.930
Thank you, Frank.

28:36.651 --> 28:36.931
Appreciate it.

28:36.951 --> 28:39.836
Frank Buell served two years and a month in the U.S.

28:39.896 --> 28:43.461
Navy, involved in the all-important task of keeping our shores safe.

28:43.863 --> 28:49.128
He followed his military service with a career in education, which, of course, is one of equal honor.

28:49.148 --> 28:51.971
We salute Frank Buell for his service, as we do all veterans.

28:52.652 --> 28:53.533
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:53.553 --> 28:56.093
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
