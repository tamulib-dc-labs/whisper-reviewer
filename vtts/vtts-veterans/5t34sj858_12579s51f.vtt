Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.569 --> 00:31.571
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.492 --> 00:40.281
Last week we started the remarkable story of service of General Ted Hopgood, telling the story of his three tours of Vietnam in the Marines

00:40.666 --> 00:48.061
But there's another 25 years to cover before he even gets to Texas A&M to start his six years as Commandant of Cadets.

00:48.562 --> 00:51.969
Please welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, General Ted Hopgood.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.514
When last we were visiting, we were leaving Vietnam.

00:54.975 --> 00:59.704
This was in November of 1970, after your third and final tour of Vietnam.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.026
Sort of take us after that.

01:01.046 --> 01:05.993
And I asked you at the end of last show if you were certain at that time that you were going to stay in the Marines and be a career guy.

01:06.013 --> 01:07.595
And you said definitely you were.

01:07.655 --> 01:08.537
Definitely I was, yes.

01:08.557 --> 01:10.259
And so sort of take us after that.

01:10.299 --> 01:16.368
I think first off, Washington, D.C., where you had continuing education at the University of Virginia, but you weren't a resident student.

01:16.388 --> 01:24.780
Well, when I came back from Vietnam, I was assigned as an instructor to the basic school at Quantico to teach second lieutenants, which was a great assignment.

01:25.250 --> 01:29.355
a captain, hard chargers with all the people we had to instruct.

01:29.555 --> 01:31.077
It was a wonderful experience.

01:31.137 --> 01:37.324
And then I got picked, the Marine Corps is great for picking you, to go to Washington, D.C.

01:37.444 --> 01:49.038
to work in the headquarters, to work in the assignment of infantry captains and artillery and tankers and so forth, about 1,500 officers to work in the assignment of.

01:49.058 --> 01:50.700
So during this time,

01:51.558 --> 01:59.134
As mentioned, I was pursuing a master's degree in education in the University of Virginia, but it was in my own time.

01:59.154 --> 02:06.850
So in the evenings, twice a week, we would go to class, and then the last semester was having to drive all the way down to Charlottesville, Virginia,

02:07.589 --> 02:18.277
to about a two-hour drive, as I recall, go to class for three hours and drive home, get home shortly after midnight and go to bed and get up the next morning bright and early to head back to duty.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.503
Hey, but you were young, you were tough.

02:20.624 --> 02:22.228
You'd been to Vietnam for three tours.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.371
You could do it all, sure.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.113
You could do it all.

02:24.093 --> 02:26.775
Talk about your assignment in Washington.

02:26.815 --> 02:32.120
You assigned infantry captains, and you were responsible for pretty much where 1,500 folks went, right?

02:32.140 --> 02:33.762
Yeah, I certainly was.

02:33.822 --> 02:44.932
It was a challenging assignment, and the good aspect was that you really got to know and work with all of your contemporaries, and you established relationships.

02:44.952 --> 02:53.560
The ones that got the good orders became good friends, and the ones that they got orders they weren't so happy about might have been not quite so good friends, but it was a great way to

02:53.860 --> 02:55.963
get to know the Marine Corps and get to know a lot of people.

02:55.983 --> 03:07.477
Then to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and then I guess sort of a rite of passage of anybody in the military, especially an officer, you go to jump school, you go to Fort Benning, and you learn to jump whether you need to jump or not.

03:07.497 --> 03:21.454
Right, en route to Camp Lejeune, I went to Fort Benning in the middle of the summer, I think it was 1975, and went to jump school for three weeks and got my jump wings, but five jumps, but never jumped after that.

03:21.991 --> 03:23.754
It was a good experience.

03:23.834 --> 03:31.487
I was the senior officer in the class as a major, so those wonderful Army drill sergeants made sure that I met the requirements.

03:31.567 --> 03:35.474
And in your retirement, you never had the desire to jump in, right?

03:35.554 --> 03:37.958
No, I never did it again, no.

03:37.938 --> 03:40.421
Newport, Rhode Island Naval War College.

03:40.461 --> 03:56.383
I want you to talk about this, not only what you did, but also a relationship that you were able to develop with Admiral James Stockdale, who not so recent historians will remember as a vice presidential running mate with Ross Perot many years ago.

03:56.423 --> 04:00.529
But you remember him as as quite a Navy man.

04:00.549 --> 04:07.118
Vice Admiral Stockdale was the president of Naval War College during my year of residency in Newport, Rhode Island.

04:08.110 --> 04:17.887
And he had been awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic conduct as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

04:18.528 --> 04:25.781
And Admiral Stockdale was a wonderful individual who shared his experiences with the students.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.207
And he had an experience that he would do

04:29.322 --> 04:48.610
Oh, once every 10 days, once every two weeks, called the President's Hour, where he would assemble everybody in both the junior class and the senior class, about 500 officers in this large auditorium, and talk about his experiences or what had recently happened or something news of the day.

04:48.630 --> 04:52.275
And the most enlightening time was when he would take questions.

04:52.660 --> 04:57.606
And I remember this one day that his presentation had been somewhat routine.

04:57.626 --> 05:00.530
I won't say boring because senior officers are never boring.

05:01.611 --> 05:11.464
But the question came from a marine aviator in the class because the Admiral had talked about what was required to survive under arduous conditions, i.e.

05:11.965 --> 05:12.906
being a POW.

05:13.667 --> 05:18.072
Some people had constructed a house in their mind down to every detail.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.498
Some people had made a slide rule in their mind.

05:22.883 --> 05:24.225
those types of things.

05:24.245 --> 05:32.357
So he also talked about the importance of Christianity that was necessary for certain people to survive in a POW environment.

05:32.978 --> 05:37.605
So the Marine Lieutenant Colonel, I was a major, the Marine Lieutenant Colonel asked me a question.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.750
He said, Admiral, I've listened closely to what you had to say.

05:41.211 --> 05:46.419
And are you telling us that to be a good soldier, you have to be a good Christian?

05:47.500 --> 05:49.363
And the Admiral said, well, I take your question

05:49.850 --> 05:53.393
to mean a good soldier includes Marine, Navy, Coast Guardsmen, whatever.

05:54.174 --> 05:57.296
And personally acknowledge that was correct.

05:57.316 --> 06:02.801
And this was a tough question, because just think of yourself before I tell you what the Admiral's response was, how you would answer that question.

06:03.041 --> 06:18.675
And the Admiral gave a deep thought, walked across the stage several times, and then he said, you know, he said, I've known too many good soldiers in my career who weren't Christians, but I've never known a soldier who was a Christian

06:18.993 --> 06:22.940
who wasn't a better soldier because of it.

06:22.960 --> 06:36.242
I thought that was profound wisdom and something that I have obviously remembered to this day and pass that story along more than once during my career in similar situations.

06:37.117 --> 06:55.038
He was quite an individual, there's no doubt about it, unfortunately, I guess, when people remember him in that element of the politics not too many years back, and that was sort of out of his element a little bit, and there were jokes about him and all of that, but there was nothing joking about this man.

06:55.198 --> 07:00.364
Obviously, he made a very big impression on you and all the people that served under him.

07:00.644 --> 07:05.790
After Newport, Rhode Island, you went to Australia for seven months with your family, and you really enjoyed that tour.

07:05.888 --> 07:10.694
Well, it was a tough tour, but as we say, somebody had to do it.

07:10.714 --> 07:13.237
And the school was in Canberra, Australia.

07:14.018 --> 07:18.324
I was the only Yank in the class, and there were 35 students in the class.

07:18.364 --> 07:23.631
We had an opportunity to travel throughout the South Pacific and all through Australia.

07:24.552 --> 07:33.904
And it was a broadening experience, not only for me, but for my family, because our two daughters were enrolled in school in Australia, and the...

07:34.660 --> 07:47.018
Just the camaraderie and the friendships that were extended to us during that experience were very memorable and deeply appreciated by me and my family.

07:47.719 --> 07:51.304
I know that you described the leaders there as really top-notch people.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.450
One, Colonel Jim Conway, is now the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

07:55.470 --> 07:56.972
He worked for you back then, right?

07:57.020 --> 07:59.743
Well, it wasn't in Australia that Jim worked for me.

07:59.763 --> 08:01.665
Jim worked for me later in Quantico.

08:01.685 --> 08:03.046
Right, I jumped ahead.

08:03.267 --> 08:21.847
When I was back in Quantico working as my last tour in the Marine Corps, I had a number of really, really high-quality people that worked for me, including the current commandant of the Marine Corps, Colonel Jim Conway, a colonel at the time, now four-star general and commandant of the Marine Corps, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, et cetera.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.548
But yes, I did.

08:23.568 --> 08:26.031
That was one of the real...

08:26.821 --> 08:48.492
memorable things of a Marine Corps career was the number of people that you worked for that were outstanding Americans and then the number, far greater number that worked for you to include certainly your troops and your subordinate officers that were just inspirational by their talents and their dedication and Jim Conway was certainly one of those people.

08:48.708 --> 08:53.874
You very proudly held a master's in education, but that didn't cut much mustard with some of those people, right?

08:53.895 --> 09:03.687
Well, when I was at Quantico, I had 17 PhDs that worked for me at the Marine Corps University.

09:03.807 --> 09:14.260
And when you're in charge of any organization, you want to make sure that you understand what all your people are doing and get to know them and so forth.

09:14.375 --> 09:17.528
But 17 PhDs was a challenge.

09:17.548 --> 09:22.208
I don't know if I ever totally understood, but I certainly greatly respected all that they did.

09:22.492 --> 09:28.718
One of your most memorable tours, and for good reason, of course, is as a brigadier general at the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon.

09:28.758 --> 09:35.924
You described it to me that you never played in the Super Bowl, but you could imagine that that was what it would be like, that job.

09:35.945 --> 09:39.628
I want you to tell us a lot about that because it's quite an interesting story.

09:39.708 --> 09:49.377
Well, all the days at the Pentagon always seemed like they started like at 0-3 or 0-4 in the morning because you had to be in there early.

09:50.133 --> 09:56.359
And when Desert Shield and Desert Storm came along, I was in the position of working in the National Military Command Center.

09:57.220 --> 10:06.108
And I often found myself briefing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who was Colin Powell, as well as the Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney.

10:07.169 --> 10:10.793
And the number of slides you could use was restricted to 32.

10:11.473 --> 10:16.778
So you started building, I guess you'd call it your slideshow, a half hour slideshow with 32 slides.

10:17.319 --> 10:18.520
You started building it about

10:18.854 --> 10:21.957
04 in the morning to be ready to go at 07.

10:22.959 --> 10:32.649
And when you got up to brief, you'd sometimes been so busy getting the slides ready that you really hadn't got your presentation down perhaps as smoothly as you might if you could really rehearse it.

10:32.669 --> 10:41.078
But they were so interested in the content because they were making some very significant decisions based on the information that you presented.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.461
So you wanted to make sure you had the information there.

10:43.863 --> 10:50.593
but you also wanted to make sure that you could present it in such a manner that they could rapidly comprehend it.

10:50.614 --> 11:03.554
So I remember the pressure of it, but it was a type of pressure that you knew what you were doing was important and you knew that with the backup of your team that it was something that you were doing well.

11:03.814 --> 11:05.116
You had a team of about 25.

11:05.437 --> 11:06.919
Yes, I did.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.301
In fact,

11:08.281 --> 11:18.356
On my team of 25 were two Navy captains who later became the Chief of Naval Operations, which is the senior position in the United States Navy.

11:19.037 --> 11:23.143
So I was surrounded, I assure you, by significant talent.

11:24.845 --> 11:37.123
But watching Colin Powell and Dick Cheney work, I was so amazed and appreciative of the type of talent that would rise to the top and that the

11:37.711 --> 11:45.321
Our country and all the men and women in uniform were really truthfully in the hands of really competent, good people.

11:46.343 --> 11:53.573
We all can remember, many of us certainly can remember the night that Operation Desert Shield became Operation Desert Storm.

11:53.793 --> 11:59.902
I think most Americans were up all night watching television with the reporters with the gas mask on that night.

12:01.364 --> 12:02.806
You were in Washington at that time.

12:02.886 --> 12:05.389
Talk about that day and that night.

12:05.429 --> 12:07.532
Well, the fact of it is when

12:07.512 --> 12:14.219
When the Iraqis crossed into Kuwait, I was coming on duty at 208 p.m.

12:14.259 --> 12:24.791
at night, and the off-going duty officer just happened to be a 1965 classmate of mine from Texas A&M, a Brigadier General at that time in the Air Force, Hale Burr.

12:25.632 --> 12:30.938
So we made the transition from his watch to my watch, not only for me but for our teams.

12:31.897 --> 12:38.025
And then during the next eight hours, it wasn't chaotic, but it was very fast-paced.

12:38.046 --> 12:47.479
I remember changing the DEFCON defense condition from five down to two of turning around a carrier battle group that was in the Indian Ocean.

12:48.260 --> 12:54.669
I remember working with the White House Situation Room to freeze all the Iraqi assets and all the banks in the United States.

12:55.369 --> 12:57.212
I remember with some...

12:58.103 --> 13:10.180
I guess fun of having to call the ready room of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions as well as the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and put them on alert and tell them what was going on, etc.

13:10.240 --> 13:19.774
So it was a fast-paced night that passed rapidly and the next morning when the other team came in and General Powell and

13:19.940 --> 13:28.592
his group came into work, I felt like we were turning over something that was, at least if it wasn't running smoothly, at least it was all set for them to make the necessary decisions.

13:28.992 --> 13:29.253
Indeed.

13:29.673 --> 13:31.776
We've got some photographs.

13:32.477 --> 13:33.699
We had some photographs last week.

13:33.719 --> 13:39.907
We've got some new ones this week of post-Vietnam, and we'd like to go ahead and go to those right now and have General Hopgood talk about them.

13:40.648 --> 13:41.209
Here you are.

13:41.710 --> 13:42.731
Tell me where this was.

13:42.831 --> 13:45.495
This was in Thailand.

13:45.515 --> 13:49.761
I was the J3 in charge of operations for the Pacific Command.

13:50.348 --> 13:58.684
And you can see in the background, just in the far background of the troops that were lined up, I remember that was a very hot day on an airfield in Thailand.

13:58.724 --> 14:03.994
And thankfully, it was a short speech, but that's where that was.

14:05.096 --> 14:07.561
The people in the background were thankful it was a short speech.

14:09.324 --> 14:09.825
Inspection.

14:10.085 --> 14:11.428
This is a...

14:11.712 --> 14:13.434
I was a lieutenant colonel in this position.

14:13.494 --> 14:18.700
I was a battalion commander at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina.

14:18.720 --> 14:28.551
I'm inspecting an M16 rifle for a young recruit who's about ready to graduate from recruit training and join the operational forces of the Marine Corps.

14:31.795 --> 14:35.239
This picture is at Camp Pendleton, California.

14:35.827 --> 14:43.296
It's a change of command where I was taking over the command of the First Force Service Support Group there at Camp Pendleton.

14:43.897 --> 14:50.505
Once again, I can tell by the audience they hope the remarks are short and I think I probably kept them short and we moved on.

14:52.067 --> 14:54.350
This next photograph is one that I was able to find.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.514
We talked about Admiral, Vice Admiral Stockdale.

14:57.713 --> 15:01.297
And here he is returning from his time as a POW in Vietnam.

15:01.377 --> 15:05.742
Yes, that's his wife Sybil in the background, and that's his three boys.

15:06.483 --> 15:09.907
And that's a welcome home in Southern California.

15:09.927 --> 15:20.939
And you can just tell how thin and gone he is that the experience he underwent as a POW in Vietnam was extremely arduous for him and his fellow prisoners.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.463
That's quite a photograph.

15:24.933 --> 15:30.101
Here's a little bit later in life when you were a marathon runner.

15:30.122 --> 15:32.545
By the anguish on my face, it must be near the end.

15:32.586 --> 15:38.575
I was probably happy to finish, but that's a shot of a Marine Corps marathon in Washington, D.C.

15:39.277 --> 15:47.991
I was never a record setter, but did it to try and stay in shape and to keep my exercise level up, and I always enjoyed running throughout my life.

15:49.694 --> 15:50.535
Some wonderful pictures.

15:50.836 --> 16:04.471
I want to move on because I want to get you to Texas A&M in 1996, but you also had a tour in Somalia, and that made quite an impression on you, to say the least, talking about Somalia and the lawlessness that you described there.

16:04.731 --> 16:20.809
Well, the time in Somalia was near the end of President Bush 41's first tour, or I mean his tour's presidency, and we went there in December and go into a city of several million people

16:21.481 --> 16:29.990
that have no police force, no schools, no hospitals, but have plenty of weapons was extremely challenging.

16:30.010 --> 16:36.436
And I'm very proud to this day of the response that our Marines did while we were there.

16:36.737 --> 16:50.931
And I remember being in command of some 1,800 Marines and sailors and was able to bring every one of them back home after I counted them 73 days on the ground in Mogadishu, Somalia.

16:51.586 --> 16:59.955
And very hot, very dirty, and I'll say dangerous from the fact of personal safety and health.

17:01.397 --> 17:07.704
You were promoted to Major General, then to Hawaii, Director of Operations of Pacific Command, working for a four-star.

17:07.804 --> 17:08.885
Talk about that tour of duty.

17:08.905 --> 17:13.190
Well, the tour out in Hawaii was that the command had responsibility for all the U.S.

17:13.210 --> 17:17.855
forces everywhere in the Pacific, all the way to the country of India.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.698
So Australia, Japan, Korea.

17:21.100 --> 17:25.866
And being in charge of operations, it was a tremendous amount of travel.

17:26.447 --> 17:37.840
So your time away from Hawaii to see people, to check on how things are going, and then to come back and have to play catch-up for two weeks was extremely demanding.

17:38.581 --> 17:43.127
But living in Hawaii certainly has its pluses.

17:43.527 --> 17:46.150
I just wish I could have enjoyed the scenery more.

17:46.171 --> 17:49.875
But it was a good place for Carolyn and the kids to be.

17:50.328 --> 17:56.257
We've got about nine minutes to talk about six years at Texas A&M, so we're going to fast forward to that fall of 1996.

17:56.337 --> 18:03.848
Talk about how you came to be able to have the honor to come back to your alma mater as Commandant of Cadets.

18:03.908 --> 18:14.563
Well, Tom Darling, my predecessor, who did a great job with the Corps, was retiring from being the Commandant of the Corps, and there was a national search that went on, and I said,

18:15.100 --> 18:25.600
put my hand as high and near as I could get, came in for the interview process, and was fortunately selected to come back to Texas A&M as the commandant.

18:25.620 --> 18:33.615
So I quickly retired from the Marine Corps and got here in August of 1996, and as you said, spent six years here.

18:34.439 --> 18:39.106
and thoroughly enjoyed my time working with the Corps of Cadets.

18:40.849 --> 18:54.008
I'm proud to say that the size of the Corps did not shrink during my six years, and the quality of the young men and women that were in the Corps was just marvelous.

18:54.669 --> 18:59.957
Just as talented and as motivated young men and women as you could ever imagine.

19:00.595 --> 19:07.684
Of course, we know this about Aggies, but my part was the Corps, and what I saw was just fantastic.

19:07.705 --> 19:22.705
And then in the subsequent years since I left in 2002 to watch their progress, whether it's on military duty or in the private sector or growth of families or going back to weddings, it's a wonderful experience.

19:23.205 --> 19:30.535
General Darling, who was your predecessor, has been in that chair, I'm very proud to say, and has been a guest here on Veterans of the Valley.

19:31.038 --> 19:36.966
You talked about how it retained its size while you were in there.

19:37.107 --> 19:40.671
It was not, there were ups and downs, obviously, one year, six years.

19:40.692 --> 19:47.701
And of course, one of the big downs, not only for the Corps, but for the entire student body, the community, and the state of Texas was in November of 1999.

19:47.781 --> 20:00.319
Well, in November of 99, when the bonfire collapsed, 12 Aggies tragically killed, numerous others tragically injured.

20:01.109 --> 20:07.635
But of the 12 killed, six were in the Corps at the time, and three had been in the Corps.

20:08.596 --> 20:19.587
And the impact that it made on everybody associated with Texas A&M, but once again, my portion was the Corps, was very sad.

20:19.607 --> 20:30.137
It was significant and something that we had to really experience leadership, compassion to get through as well as we did.

20:32.513 --> 20:34.896
Talk about, you talked about some of the accomplishments.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.261
One of them I know you're very proud of, the review stand over at the Simpson drill field.

20:38.381 --> 20:40.604
You were here when they constructed that permanent.

20:40.624 --> 20:57.627
Right, the review stand on Simpson drill field with the great assistance and financial support of Jim Kelly from Brenham and his class to construct and put that reviewing stand over on the drill field to mark, if you will.

20:57.927 --> 21:11.262
Simpson-Drill Field as permanent ownership for the Corps of Cadets for reviews was something that I and everybody that was associated with the project are extremely proud of.

21:11.461 --> 21:15.546
See it today when driving by in front of the MSC or driving by the drill field.

21:15.606 --> 21:18.970
I always take a great deal of satisfaction in that.

21:18.990 --> 21:27.419
One thing we didn't talk about the other day that I'll sort of throw at you is obviously the relationship that has been forged between Texas A&M and former President Bush.

21:27.499 --> 21:34.327
And I know that you were as commandant of cadets while he was developing his library and had his library here.

21:34.347 --> 21:37.431
I know that that's a relationship and a friendship that you treasure.

21:38.152 --> 21:41.215
Well, President Bush is 41.

21:42.359 --> 21:46.808
Tremendous record of service in World War II as a naval aviator.

21:47.710 --> 21:59.514
And then his association with the Corps, everything from the dedication of his library in which the Ross Volunteers, the Corps of Cadets, the Aggie Band were prominently featured was significant.

22:00.195 --> 22:04.063
The numerous times that he has included the Corps,

22:04.533 --> 22:13.508
in the presentations of national and international personalities that have come to Texas A&M has certainly enriched the Corps of Cadets.

22:13.528 --> 22:30.237
His personal friendship with me and with other leaders of the Corps has been continuous and it's been substantial and very helpful in so many ways on a personal basis as well as organizational basis for the Corps.

22:31.010 --> 22:32.312
We've got about three minutes left.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.174
I want you to talk about your family.

22:34.194 --> 22:35.215
We talked about Carolyn.

22:35.235 --> 22:38.780
You've been married for 41 years and you have two daughters.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.442
And so talk about your family.

22:40.462 --> 22:43.686
You've got time to brag on them right now.

22:43.706 --> 22:50.355
Carolyn was in the United States Navy and her dad is a retired Navy captain and her brother is a retired Navy admiral.

22:50.375 --> 22:52.157
So she comes from a service family.

22:52.559 --> 22:55.264
And we've had a wonderful, fulfilling marriage.

22:55.324 --> 22:56.988
We have two daughters.

22:57.008 --> 23:01.817
One, Jennifer, our oldest, is currently at the University of Houston Law School.

23:03.160 --> 23:07.428
She graduated from Cal Berkeley and has an advanced degree from that school in Austin.

23:08.310 --> 23:12.798
And our youngest daughter, Catherine, is through and through Aggie, as is her husband.

23:12.818 --> 23:13.740
She's got both her

23:14.294 --> 23:25.738
undergraduate and graduate degrees from Texas A&M, and Kathleen and her husband, Barry, are the proud parents of our two grandchildren, Michael and Elizabeth, nine and seven years old at the current time.

23:26.056 --> 23:29.744
want to be and hope to be Aggies in waiting.

23:29.985 --> 23:31.267
Do you get to see enough of them?

23:32.370 --> 23:33.312
As much as we can.

23:33.372 --> 23:39.265
It seems like once or twice a month we are with the grandkids and we enjoy every minute we spend with them.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.590
What are some of the things that you're doing now in retirement?

23:41.610 --> 23:42.973
I know you're involved with your church.

23:43.033 --> 23:43.394
What else?

23:43.554 --> 23:45.178
Well, the church work is...

23:46.053 --> 23:47.536
It's very fulfilling.

23:47.837 --> 23:56.697
Travel, I think this past summer, a four-month period, we made five trips from East Coast, West Coast, North and South, so we do a lot of travel.

23:57.660 --> 24:05.277
And, of course, staying reasonably fit to include a lot of golf helps, yard work.

24:05.813 --> 24:09.279
and really enjoying life here in the College Station area.

24:09.399 --> 24:15.310
And, of course, keeping a close track of Aggie athletics is always enjoyable also.

24:15.330 --> 24:15.751
Yeah, I know.

24:15.771 --> 24:16.953
You make the games.

24:16.973 --> 24:21.561
And I know you told me that one of the big thrills was athletically was going to that

24:21.929 --> 24:24.433
Big 12 championship game where they beat Kansas State.

24:25.054 --> 24:36.130
Well, in 1998, for those, many Aggies I know were there, but for you that weren't, it was about, it was a sold-out house in the Dome in St.

24:36.150 --> 24:51.733
Louis, and it was about 80% purple and white, and the rest of us were Aggies, and as you might recall, A&M won in overtime with a pass to Sir Parker, and the celebration was long and continuous, and by the time we were done

24:52.051 --> 24:57.498
saw on Varsity's horns off for the, I don't know how many times and so forth, it came time for the band to leave.

24:57.598 --> 25:01.383
And I had traveled up there, my wife and I had traveled up with the band.

25:01.403 --> 25:11.515
So there was a tunnel that we had to go out, and on the way out to the tunnel, because it was, light rain was falling outside, it was just full of Kansas State supporters.

25:11.895 --> 25:17.042
And I said to myself, based on past experiences, I said, oh, this is gonna be a challenge.

25:17.062 --> 25:19.645
But as the Aggie band started down the tunnel,

25:19.945 --> 25:26.859
And the way the Aggie band marches when they're not playing their weapons is the click, if you will, of the drumsticks on the metal part of the drums.

25:27.720 --> 25:35.897
And so the Aggie band starts marching down the tunnel and the Kansas State fans, great fans, bless their hearts, backed up against the wall.

25:36.017 --> 25:41.548
And as the Aggie band marched through, they began to applaud and then louder.

25:41.849 --> 25:54.467
So here we are, winning the Big 12 championship, marching through the stands, and somehow the buses in this rain, the Aggie Band buses were right outside the entrance, and the Kansas State buses were off in the distance.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.489
So we got on the buses.

25:55.629 --> 25:57.712
It made you feel great.

25:57.752 --> 25:58.393
We're out of time.

25:58.974 --> 25:59.495
Great story.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.619
And thank you very much for your service and for being with us for two weeks.

26:02.699 --> 26:03.180
My pleasure.

26:03.200 --> 26:03.601
Thank you.

26:03.621 --> 26:03.941
Thank you.

26:04.822 --> 26:07.506
You have seen and heard over the last two shows.

26:07.626 --> 26:09.409
What you've heard is only a fraction of

26:09.389 --> 26:18.512
of Ted Hopgood's story of service, a 31-year Marine who made a round trip of sorts from his alma mater, A&M, and back more than 30 years later to head up the Corps.

26:18.532 --> 26:21.279
Ted and Carolyn Hopgood have been married for 41 years.

26:21.339 --> 26:22.963
We salute their service.

26:23.444 --> 26:24.346
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:24.366 --> 26:26.672
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
