00:09.278 --> 00:34.037
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.478 --> 00:35.640
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.886 --> 00:44.281
The mission of the 433rd Tactical Fighter Squadron out of Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base was a difficult one.

00:44.782 --> 00:52.718
It was the height of the Vietnam War, and the North Vietnamese government treasured its only steel mill, located just north of Hanoi.

00:52.698 --> 00:58.807
A half dozen surface-to-air missiles and more than a thousand anti-aircraft guns protected it.

00:59.428 --> 01:02.493
But it was the 433rd's mission to destroy it.

01:02.513 --> 01:12.087
March the 10th, 1967, then Captain Bob Pardo and Captain Earl Amon, each piloting F-4 Phantoms with their backseaters, Steve Wayne and Robert Houghton.

01:12.848 --> 01:14.571
Little did they know that that day,

01:14.990 --> 01:17.956
they would make military aviation history.

01:17.976 --> 01:27.634
Ask any military flyer about Pardo's push, and they still marvel at the unbelievable story of how four airmen survived against the longest odds.

01:27.654 --> 01:32.924
Now retired Lieutenant Colonel Bob Pardo lives with his wife, Catherine, in College Station.

01:32.944 --> 01:34.467
And what a story he has to tell.

01:35.273 --> 01:36.654
Lieutenant Colonel Pardo, welcome.

01:36.674 --> 01:37.836
Thank you for being with us.

01:38.276 --> 01:39.297
We've set the scene here.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.940
Let's talk about the mission again on March 10, 1967.

01:42.961 --> 01:47.045
This was obviously the only manufacturing plant for steel the North Vietnamese had.

01:47.385 --> 01:49.347
They were very interested in protecting it.

01:49.367 --> 01:53.611
You, the Air Force, were very interested in destroying it.

01:53.631 --> 01:56.194
Talk a little bit more about the mission.

01:56.234 --> 02:02.800
The mission had been laid on nine days before this event happened.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.337
We'd made several attempts to strike the target.

02:07.158 --> 02:17.047
However, each attempt was incomplete in that the weather was so bad, we could not get to the target.

02:17.067 --> 02:22.432
And on the 10th of March, the weather cleared just enough that we were able to complete the strike.

02:24.414 --> 02:31.521
Strike force consisted of about 40 strike aircraft, F-105s and F-4s,

02:32.294 --> 02:35.198
our flight was the last formation in the strike force.

02:36.740 --> 02:48.615
As we approached the target, about 40 miles north, Earl Amon, who was the number four man in our flight, was hit by an aircraft fire.

02:49.916 --> 03:00.850
A few lights came on, warning lights came on, but as he proceeded, the lights started to go back up, systems recovered, the airplane was flying very well,

03:01.437 --> 03:09.006
And so there was he and his backseater, Bob Houghton, talked it over and decided that it would be fine if they continued the mission.

03:11.209 --> 03:15.574
So we continued on down towards the target.

03:15.594 --> 03:28.170
We were forced to fly lower than ordinary so that when we did arrive at the target, we had to climb several thousand feet to get to our roll-in altitude for the bomb run.

03:29.568 --> 03:34.655
Just as the formation rolled in on the target, Earl got hit again.

03:36.578 --> 03:41.144
Since he was directly over the target, he saw no reason why he shouldn't continue.

03:41.785 --> 03:44.168
Go ahead and put his bombs on the target with everybody else.

03:44.428 --> 03:46.852
This is a point I don't want to gloss over.

03:47.112 --> 03:52.900
He certainly had the option when he was hit the first time, much less the second time that he could have gone right onto the tanker, said, I'm hit.

03:53.341 --> 03:53.901
I'm out of here.

03:53.941 --> 03:54.963
He chose not to do that.

03:54.983 --> 03:56.605
Absolutely.

03:57.091 --> 03:59.734
That kind of bravery right there tells you something about that gentleman, right?

03:59.754 --> 04:00.495
Yes, it does.

04:00.515 --> 04:01.376
Yes, indeed.

04:02.097 --> 04:02.437
Go ahead.

04:02.717 --> 04:03.698
Talk about what happened then.

04:05.380 --> 04:17.794
Actually, after they were hit the first time, he and Bob talked it over, and they decided that they would say a little prayer.

04:20.457 --> 04:22.319
So they swapped flying the airplane.

04:22.419 --> 04:24.702
One guy would fly while the other one prayed.

04:25.373 --> 04:29.659
then they'd change control, and the other guy would have his little prayer.

04:31.581 --> 04:37.649
And as I said, rolling in on the target, he got hit, and so he decided to continue.

04:37.869 --> 04:41.774
He could have left then also, but he decided to continue with the bomb run.

04:43.477 --> 04:54.671
Pulling off the target, Steve and I were hit pretty heavy, but the main thing at that point is simply to keep the formation together and head outbound.

04:55.072 --> 04:55.212
Mm-hmm.

04:55.698 --> 05:11.477
The first thing we do after coming off the target is get off of the strike frequency to reduce congestion on the air, get a fuel check, and a battle damage check.

05:11.497 --> 05:19.106
When we got the fuel check, we have a certain amount of gas that we need at the target in order to make it back to the base.

05:20.107 --> 05:25.654
We have another number that we use to determine if we can get back to the refueling tanker.

05:25.803 --> 05:35.534
And for our purposes that day, 7,000 pounds of fuel was required to make it back to the base, 5,000 pounds to make it to the tanker.

05:37.876 --> 05:49.910
As our flight checked in, giving our fuel status to the flight leader, I was 2,000 pounds short of gas, which indicated that I at least might be able to make it to the tanker.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.393
But Earl was short 5,000 pounds.

05:53.494 --> 05:55.776
He was down to only 2,000 pounds remaining.

05:56.465 --> 06:01.552
That 2,000 pounds in a phantom would not get him out of North Vietnam, much less to the tanker.

06:01.712 --> 06:03.555
About how many minutes of flying time is that?

06:03.575 --> 06:08.061
2,000 pounds.

06:08.462 --> 06:09.924
Maybe 15 to 20 minutes.

06:11.406 --> 06:11.747
Not much.

06:12.107 --> 06:12.508
Not much.

06:16.193 --> 06:19.457
So it became obvious that he was not going to make it out of North Vietnam.

06:19.818 --> 06:24.885
Well, in the flatlands up there, if you go down,

06:25.658 --> 06:30.486
You basically have two different things that are going to happen.

06:30.506 --> 06:33.851
If the civilians captured you, they would probably kill you on the spot.

06:34.813 --> 06:42.545
If you were captured by the militia or the active military, you were going to prison.

06:42.565 --> 06:45.550
Neither of which is a very good option.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.091
Certainly not.

06:47.152 --> 06:52.020
So while we were outbound, Earl was having trouble keeping up with the formation.

06:52.743 --> 07:01.832
And so I started to lag behind and stay with him, just in case the MiGs came after us for a revenge kill on the way out.

07:01.852 --> 07:06.717
I still had missiles on board and significantly more fuel than he had.

07:07.818 --> 07:14.725
But they didn't attack, so we simply flew southwest until we crossed the Red River.

07:15.846 --> 07:22.412
As soon as you cross the Red River outbound to the west, things start getting better very quickly.

07:22.898 --> 07:29.028
fewer guns, hardly any missiles, and so Earl felt that it was safe to climb.

07:29.068 --> 07:35.318
He wanted to climb as high as possible so that when he flamed out he could glide as far as he could.

07:35.338 --> 07:42.129
I want to stop you right there and I want to show a picture of young Captain Bob Pardo and Captain Wayne here that we have ready.

07:42.149 --> 07:44.653
This is a photograph that was

07:44.937 --> 07:45.738
taken.

07:45.758 --> 07:46.860
When was this taken?

07:46.880 --> 07:49.083
Was this taken before this date or after this date?

07:49.103 --> 07:49.704
When was this taken?

07:49.724 --> 07:50.205
Do you recall?

07:50.425 --> 07:53.309
I think it was taken a couple of weeks before.

07:54.531 --> 08:03.484
We had the squadron together for a class picture, you know, and while they were doing that, they let each individual crew have a picture made at the same time.

08:03.504 --> 08:05.487
And you're standing in front of an F-4?

08:05.507 --> 08:05.727
Yes.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.172
There you go.

08:09.733 --> 08:14.860
The standard load on the airplanes on a bombing mission would be the

08:15.245 --> 08:18.890
Huge tank you can see under the center of the airplane, 600 gallons of fuel.

08:19.671 --> 08:26.781
And then on the inboard pylons, six 750-pound bombs.

08:26.801 --> 08:27.722
Okay.

08:27.743 --> 08:28.504
Continue the story.

08:28.524 --> 08:29.265
I think you left off.

08:29.325 --> 08:35.694
Earl had gone high so that when he... When he flamed out, he would have maximum glide distance.

08:36.675 --> 08:42.383
While we were climbing up to altitude, he had jettisoned everything off of his airplane that he could get rid of.

08:42.852 --> 08:46.196
bomb racks, pylons, everything to reduce the drag.

08:46.216 --> 08:49.479
I had done the same thing except my centerline tank wouldn't jettison.

08:50.941 --> 08:59.550
Ordinarily we'd jettison it inbound as soon as it's out of fuel just to get rid of the drag, but my tank wouldn't jettison so I still had it.

09:02.633 --> 09:07.339
We were looking at his airplane over and I'm thinking the airplane is flying fine.

09:08.220 --> 09:08.640
He has

09:08.857 --> 09:10.419
perfect control of the airplane.

09:11.541 --> 09:14.245
He's simply going to run out of gas.

09:14.265 --> 09:23.158
And I thought there's got to be something we can do to get him to the jungle and out of the flatlands here.

09:25.421 --> 09:37.058
And it occurred to me that perhaps if he would jettison the drag chute, which is right on the tail end of the airplane, that I could put the nose of my airplane into the drag chute compartment and push.

09:38.371 --> 09:49.427
We attempted that, but the turbulence coming off of his airplane was so great that when we got within about three feet of him, it was just throwing us all over the sky, so we had to abandon that.

09:51.169 --> 10:01.864
We backed away from him, dropped down underneath his airplane, and tried to put the top of our fuselage up against the belly of his airplane.

10:02.924 --> 10:13.514
And as we got within about a foot of his airplane, we could feel a vacuum or a suction pulling our airplane up against his.

10:13.534 --> 10:20.360
It had become obvious to Steve and I that we weren't going to make it either, that we were losing fuel apparently from battle damage.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.361
Yes.

10:21.381 --> 10:25.905
And that we were not going to make it, and we were going to have to eject.

10:25.985 --> 10:31.530
So we didn't want to damage the canopies and possibly not be able to eject.

10:33.147 --> 10:38.015
So we backed away once more and we just sat beneath his airplane about like that.

10:38.296 --> 10:40.359
Fighter pilots can't talk without using their hands.

10:41.421 --> 10:45.128
And we're looking up at the bottom of his airplane.

10:46.069 --> 10:52.320
And of course, the F-4 was originally designed for the Navy for use on carriers as fleet defense.

10:52.655 --> 10:55.838
so it's equipped with a tail hook for carrier landings.

10:55.858 --> 11:13.438
Well, the Air Force retained the tail hook when we bought the airplane so that we could put a resting gear on our runways, and if you came back to land with an emergency, the fire truck could park in one spot, and that's where you were going to be after you took the barrier.

11:13.458 --> 11:21.987
Well, I'm looking at the tail hook, and I thought, well, it's about six feet long, and it sticks down about a 45-degree angle below the airplane, gets us...

11:22.355 --> 11:23.597
down below it pretty good.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.663
And I told Earl to drop the tail hook.

11:28.546 --> 11:32.172
And this all happened about the same time.

11:32.192 --> 11:37.341
He's running out of gas very fast, and there's only about 200 pounds left.

11:37.361 --> 11:41.469
And I said, just go ahead and shut it down, get rid of the jet wash.

11:41.489 --> 11:46.337
And then we were able to move in, put his tail hook in the middle of our windshield,

11:46.773 --> 11:47.975
So he's a glider.

11:48.216 --> 11:50.741
He is now flying the world's heaviest glider.

11:50.761 --> 11:53.507
About what speed were you going before he shut down the engine?

11:53.687 --> 11:56.573
Well, best glide speed for the airplane is 250 knots.

11:56.593 --> 11:58.517
So that's how fast we were going.

12:01.143 --> 12:03.347
Once he flamed out, the rate of descent

12:04.053 --> 12:06.917
for the Phantom is about 3,000 feet a minute.

12:07.998 --> 12:13.325
So from 36,000 feet, we just had over 10 minutes and we were going to be in the jungle.

12:13.345 --> 12:14.807
Okay, so the tail hook is deployed.

12:14.987 --> 12:26.162
And we eased up very slowly, very gently put it in the middle of the windshield, started adding power, and the vertical speed reduced to about 1,500 feet a minute.

12:27.104 --> 12:36.322
That essentially told us that we were going to double his glide distance, and we could see that we were going to make it into the jungle.

12:36.342 --> 12:39.909
So I want people to get the picture of this, the tail hook.

12:39.969 --> 12:44.117
You have maneuvered your airplane, the windshield.

12:44.519 --> 12:47.843
And describe for me, you showed me one that you have at your home.

12:47.863 --> 12:56.412
The windshield of the F4 is a vertical sort of a long oval type with a flat bottom thing with an inch thick glass, right?

12:56.432 --> 12:58.715
Yes, it's about an inch thick.

12:58.735 --> 13:02.339
It's sloped very sharply in front of the pilot.

13:05.303 --> 13:09.367
So with the hook in place, I'm looking at the hook about right there.

13:11.109 --> 13:11.910
And...

13:12.768 --> 13:15.431
It started to gouge a few holes in the windshield.

13:16.832 --> 13:30.165
A few little cracks started to appear, and I had to move the hook to the bottom of the windshield and place it on a very small metal area that we used for de-icing.

13:30.185 --> 13:34.630
Hot air came out of this little metal section just beneath the windshield.

13:36.391 --> 13:37.893
That's on the F4C model.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.256
Other models, it's different.

13:43.396 --> 13:49.862
We were trying to stay away, as far away from his airplane as we could to stay out of the turbulence coming off the bottom of the wing.

13:51.243 --> 13:56.628
But that little bit of vertical movement on our part didn't seem to change things.

13:57.709 --> 14:01.552
So we were still able to keep the hook against the windshield and push.

14:02.153 --> 14:04.235
Now, the hook swivels from side to side.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.959
It's held down hydraulically, but it is allowed to swivel from side to side.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.222
And there was no way we could fly perfectly straight

14:12.607 --> 14:15.611
And so the hook would slide off the windshield.

14:15.631 --> 14:17.773
So you could push it about, what, like 20 to 30 seconds at a time?

14:17.793 --> 14:19.295
20 to 30 seconds at a time.

14:19.315 --> 14:28.406
And we'd back up 8 or 10 inches, put it back in the middle of the windshield or down at the bottom of the windshield, add the power, and go again.

14:28.426 --> 14:32.311
And so we were keeping his vertical speed at about 1,500 feet a minute.

14:33.232 --> 14:36.936
And then our left engine caught on fire.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.200
So we had to shut the left engine down.

14:41.463 --> 14:50.034
We went back in, tried it again, but now with one engine, we were only able to hold the vertical speed at about 2,000 feet a minute.

14:52.417 --> 15:00.568
And I told Steve, it's getting rough because with one engine out, the airplane has a tendency to fly sideways.

15:00.734 --> 15:13.251
So I was having to use rudder to keep the airplane perfectly straight, which, although that doesn't sound like a big deal, under those circumstances, it did make it more difficult.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.694
And I said, Steve, I've got to crank this thing back up.

15:17.136 --> 15:21.081
Ordinarily, you never restart an engine that's been on fire.

15:21.101 --> 15:24.846
But in this case, I thought the airplane's going to go in the jungle anyway.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.529
It doesn't matter if we do more damage.

15:27.851 --> 15:28.952
So I restarted the engine.

15:29.236 --> 15:31.199
And it lasted for about two minutes.

15:32.201 --> 15:39.132
Caught fire again, and I said, well, we've got to shut it down and leave it shut down, otherwise we may blow this thing up.

15:39.152 --> 15:41.275
And this increased your descent rate then, right?

15:41.295 --> 15:44.580
It increased the descent rate back to about 2,000 feet a minute.

15:45.782 --> 15:50.890
So we continued the remainder of the push, another eight or ten minutes on one engine.

15:51.882 --> 16:01.591
When we got down to about 6,000 feet above the ground, that's as low as I wanted to go because people start shooting at you with rifles and pistols and throwing rocks at you.

16:01.631 --> 16:04.434
So we backed out from under him.

16:05.635 --> 16:09.439
He did have one radio working, and we told him to go ahead and punch.

16:09.799 --> 16:14.344
And we saw both seats leave the airplane, watched both parachutes open.

16:15.285 --> 16:19.209
And then Steve and I headed back to the northwest a little bit.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.610
He had been keeping track.

16:20.670 --> 16:21.771
All of our nav system was

16:22.105 --> 16:26.350
And he had been keeping track of where we were by following a map.

16:26.851 --> 16:35.361
And when he reported to the rescue people where these guys went down, when they got out there, he had them pinpointed within one mile.

16:35.901 --> 16:45.152
About how long, Bob, from the time that you first engaged the tail hook on your windshield to the time that you reached 6,000 feet and you let him go, about how long a span of time was that?

16:45.172 --> 16:45.893
About 20 minutes.

16:47.575 --> 16:50.138
During that time, you all were in communication with each other?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.719
We had radios, but we weren't talking.

16:52.739 --> 16:53.320
You weren't talking.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.565
You were too busy, and you all were both too busy to have a whole lot of conversation.

16:56.685 --> 16:57.426
Nothing to discuss.

16:58.488 --> 16:59.269
He knew what you were doing.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.113
You knew what you had to do.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.775
Okay, so you let him go.

17:03.815 --> 17:07.921
It's 6,000 feet, and it's time for him to get out of there.

17:07.941 --> 17:08.963
Yep.

17:09.403 --> 17:18.977
After we saw that they had both successfully ejected, we headed towards a special forces camp that we were pretty sure was only about 20 miles away.

17:20.678 --> 17:23.562
We didn't make it.

17:23.582 --> 17:29.350
We ran out of gas maybe within two minutes after we watched Earl and Bob eject.

17:30.691 --> 17:31.753
And I said, that's it, Steve.

17:31.993 --> 17:32.874
I'll see you on the ground.

17:33.475 --> 17:37.400
Because you were down to about 300 pounds of gas when you let them go, right?

17:37.501 --> 17:42.828
By the time we finished the push, we were somewhere between 300 and 400 pounds, which is no more than a couple of minutes.

17:43.248 --> 17:43.909
Right.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.614
And so we were probably...

17:48.573 --> 17:50.875
10 or 12 miles short of a special forces camp.

17:51.656 --> 17:54.859
And I thought, well, once we're on the ground, we might hook up.

17:54.879 --> 17:58.682
We had always planned on trying to get together once we were on the ground if we were shot down.

17:59.983 --> 18:04.207
And I thought if we can hook up, well, we can navigate our way over to the special forces camp.

18:04.507 --> 18:08.851
Did you know that you had successfully gotten out of North Vietnam and that you were?

18:08.931 --> 18:10.493
Yes, we were aware.

18:10.793 --> 18:14.657
You were aware that you were in safer territory than you had been 20 minutes earlier?

18:14.757 --> 18:14.957
Yes.

18:16.819 --> 18:18.360
Still enemy territory.

18:18.813 --> 18:27.083
The place where we went down was about 20 miles north of a town called Banban, and it was communist headquarters for all of Laos.

18:27.824 --> 18:32.209
So we didn't pick a real good spot, but it was better than where we were.

18:32.930 --> 18:33.871
Indeed.

18:33.891 --> 18:43.864
And the jungle is a great place to hide, evade, and that's the primary reason we wanted to be in the jungle.

18:43.884 --> 18:44.905
Talk more about your rescue.

18:44.985 --> 18:48.229
The Jolly Greens came in?

18:48.547 --> 18:56.916
Our flight leader and element leader had gone to the tanker to get fuel and come back and fly cover for us and start the rescue operation.

18:57.997 --> 19:07.788
And probably by the time Earl and Bob ejected, the helicopters probably were on their way.

19:08.409 --> 19:13.474
The helicopters are escorted by A1E Sandy's World War II

19:14.078 --> 19:28.819
prop fighter, because they can stay slow enough to stay with the helicopters, but they always send one on ahead to get to the downed airmen and take care of identification.

19:30.041 --> 19:40.255
As many people as we'd had shot down, the North Vietnamese had a good collection of our survival radios, and so they would put an English speaker

19:40.690 --> 19:44.816
on the radio and try to talk the helicopters into coming in and picking them up.

19:45.337 --> 19:49.062
And so we had to go through an identification process.

19:49.082 --> 19:56.974
And the guy asked me, what was my dog's name, what was my mother's maiden name, so forth.

19:56.994 --> 19:58.336
And he finally says, what's your birthday?

19:59.017 --> 19:59.998
And I said, 10 March.

20:00.350 --> 20:26.931
and he said well happy birthday and it was it was the first that i realized that i was flying on my birthday i'll be darned i uh i had never flown on my birthday since 1956 when i lost a friend on his birthday and i said that's not a very good way for the kids to remember their dad so no i never flew on my birthday need to fast forward because i want you to tell a story you're in the uh you're in the helicopter and uh

20:27.215 --> 20:32.000
something a little bit unusual happens, that if there's any humor to this day, this is when it happened.

20:32.020 --> 20:32.781
Well, it was.

20:32.921 --> 20:55.365
The whole situation after we left the airplanes was pretty humorous, but the incident you're thinking of, I had just sat down on the bench on the side of the helicopter, and the helicopter had climbed a little bit above the trees and started back to the northwest, and I thought,

20:55.953 --> 20:57.215
We just came from up there.

20:57.435 --> 20:58.918
Why are we going to the north?

20:59.959 --> 21:07.050
And I'm sitting there contemplating this, and all of a sudden, I hear one of the engines start to unwind on the helicopter.

21:08.693 --> 21:20.291
And the pararescue fellow turned and looked at me, and I must have had some weird expression on my face because he came over and sat down beside me, and he said, Captain, don't worry.

21:20.311 --> 21:22.274
He says the engine didn't quit.

21:22.294 --> 21:24.137
He said the pilot's on his first mission.

21:24.472 --> 21:27.137
And the instructor just gave him a simulated engine failure.

21:29.060 --> 21:32.486
I told him to ask them if they couldn't do their training some other time.

21:33.768 --> 21:35.130
You'd had enough excitement for that?

21:35.191 --> 21:36.373
I've had just about enough.

21:39.779 --> 21:41.381
So you are rescued.

21:41.622 --> 21:48.133
We're going to go ahead and fast forward now years later because I want to talk about how Pardo's push came about.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.643
Many years later, you're awarded the Silver Star.

21:51.883 --> 21:54.366
And that came about not real easily.

21:54.426 --> 21:57.970
I know that the late former Senator John Tower had something to do with that.

21:58.150 --> 21:58.470
Yes.

21:58.490 --> 22:00.512
Talk a little bit about being awarded the Silver Star.

22:00.553 --> 22:05.277
And as you're talking, as a matter of fact, we have a photograph of you being awarded the Silver Star.

22:05.338 --> 22:06.439
Go ahead and tell us about that.

22:07.240 --> 22:18.171
Well, our organization was having a reunion, and one of my golf partners at the golf tourney asked me what the award Steve and I had received.

22:18.961 --> 22:22.188
And I said we didn't receive any awards.

22:22.208 --> 22:29.142
We were chewed out pretty severely, but we kind of let that blow over and we just never bothered to talk about it.

22:30.786 --> 22:33.150
We didn't want any awards.

22:33.511 --> 22:38.742
Our reward was seeing our buddies come back.

22:39.852 --> 22:42.817
But he said, well, that's not good enough.

22:42.837 --> 22:48.727
And he talked to Senator Tower, who was in confirmation hearings for Secretary of Defense.

22:49.788 --> 22:53.995
And we were actually approved for the Air Force Cross.

22:55.097 --> 22:58.743
But in the process, that was downgraded to Silver Star.

23:01.207 --> 23:04.973
We went to Shaw Air Force Base, where Steve was still in the Air Force at the time.

23:05.013 --> 23:05.995
He had not retired yet.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.443
And he said, hey, my boss is a three-star.

23:09.463 --> 23:14.051
He's a fighter pilot from Vietnam, a great guy.

23:15.112 --> 23:20.702
And so General Chuck Horner made the presentation.

23:20.722 --> 23:23.006
It was a wonderful event for our families.

23:25.430 --> 23:30.499
We didn't feel it was necessary.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.020
Right.

23:32.418 --> 23:34.262
Want to fast forward again.

23:34.302 --> 23:37.329
We're going to put a picture up on the screen as soon as we get it here.

23:37.890 --> 23:40.356
These are three of the four of you.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.322
Lieutenant Colonel Amon is not at this picture.

23:43.583 --> 23:47.692
Talk a little bit about this photograph and when it was taken.

23:47.712 --> 23:50.258
I think it's going to be coming up on the screen here shortly.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.001
soon.

23:51.021 --> 23:51.421
There it is.

23:52.343 --> 23:52.903
You're in the middle.

23:53.644 --> 23:58.552
The photograph was taken at Randolph Air Force Base.

23:58.572 --> 24:13.614
Each year after the POWs came back, a particular training squadron at Randolph was charged with the responsibility of getting the pilots, the POW pilots, recurrent in jet airplanes.

24:13.634 --> 24:14.035
And

24:14.538 --> 24:16.641
Earl lived in San Antonio.

24:16.661 --> 24:17.702
Right.

24:17.722 --> 24:25.411
So some friends said, okay, we want to bring Earl out for this event.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.353
It's a wonderful event.

24:28.595 --> 24:35.663
And they're going to bring some F-4s from Holloman Air Force Base up here and put them on static display.

24:36.865 --> 24:43.633
And it'd be great to get a picture of you and Earl together standing by the airplane or out by the airplane.

24:43.951 --> 24:47.816
I said, okay, why don't we go ahead and get both backseaters here?

24:47.836 --> 24:53.804
So after a few phone calls, we had assurances that Steve and Bob would be there.

24:55.646 --> 25:02.695
And we kind of stayed in the background until they rolled Earl out to look at the F-4.

25:03.737 --> 25:04.978
Indeed, indeed.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.682
Go ahead.

25:07.702 --> 25:09.704
He is not in the picture that you showed.

25:11.627 --> 25:13.249
He had been there signing prints.

25:13.938 --> 25:21.666
for quite a while and became very tired and he was on a respirator.

25:21.686 --> 25:28.032
And so we excused him to go back to the BOQ and lay down and get some rest.

25:28.653 --> 25:32.016
But that was the first time that the four of us had been together in 29 years.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.159
We're going to show the audience a fascinating photograph.

25:35.259 --> 25:37.802
And as we're getting ready to show it, I want you to talk about it.

25:37.922 --> 25:41.886
Years later, you run into an artist who's

25:42.372 --> 25:45.296
primary work was military art.

25:45.316 --> 25:46.318
And there it is.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.820
Talk about this art piece.

25:50.023 --> 25:55.451
I was at a military reunion in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

25:55.471 --> 26:00.478
And we were all sitting around having a cool one and telling war stories.

26:01.619 --> 26:10.472
And this artist that's been sitting there listening to some of this said, I'd like to hear a story about something besides a dog fight.

26:11.853 --> 26:16.640
Well, I really would have rather told him about my dog fight, but said, well, I can tell you one.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.701
I don't know what you can do with it.

26:18.543 --> 26:25.733
And I described the event to him, and he said, I think I'd like to do a picture of that, and this is the result.

26:27.135 --> 26:30.320
It's correct in every detail.

26:31.241 --> 26:36.088
The aircraft tail numbers are the exact same airplanes we were flying that day.

26:36.862 --> 26:45.450
If you look closely in the airplane that I'm flying, you can see a red star where one of my squadron buddies had shot down a MiG with that airplane the week before.

26:47.411 --> 26:49.893
You can see individual rivets.

26:49.913 --> 26:51.815
It's a wonderful piece of art.

26:53.677 --> 27:03.025
Bob, in the history books, looking at the Vietnam War, probably our children and grandchildren will see it written that we did not win the Vietnam War.

27:03.085 --> 27:04.386
You disagree.

27:04.406 --> 27:05.367
You've got about one minute

27:07.507 --> 27:09.790
Tell us your thoughts on that.

27:09.810 --> 27:12.034
Well, I'll put it very plainly.

27:12.054 --> 27:21.307
We didn't lose the war, and I want all the veterans out there to understand that we did not lose the war.

27:22.329 --> 27:27.657
Our troops, Army, Marines, beat them on the ground.

27:27.677 --> 27:30.300
Navy, Air Force, Marine pilots beat them in the air.

27:31.682 --> 27:33.105
We won the battles.

27:34.326 --> 27:35.488
We won the war.

27:37.173 --> 27:44.783
And then when our negotiators got to Paris, as soon as they got our POWs out, they gave it away.

27:44.803 --> 27:46.305
It was bargained away.

27:47.867 --> 28:05.050
Of course, we're very happy that we got the POWs out when we did, the way we did, because although victory would have been wonderful, total victory.

28:05.311 --> 28:06.252
Yes, sir.

28:06.755 --> 28:08.601
That was not to be.

28:08.621 --> 28:10.808
Thank you, Bob Pardo, for your service and thank you for being here.

28:10.849 --> 28:12.695
It's an incredible story.

28:12.715 --> 28:15.825
The story that you have just heard is one that raises the bar of courage.

28:15.905 --> 28:19.718
Lieutenant Colonel Bob Pardo tells it with pride and with a heavy heart.

28:20.018 --> 28:24.724
as he remembers his friend whose life he helped save more than 38 years ago.

28:25.385 --> 28:33.796
Pardo's push gave Earl Amen many more years until he faced a vicious and cruel enemy that he could not defeat, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

28:34.437 --> 28:37.000
It is to his memory that we dedicate this program.

28:37.901 --> 28:43.188
You can go to your favorite internet search engine and type in Pardo's push and read a whole lot more.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.811
Please thank a veteran today.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.494
For Lieutenant Colonel Bob Pardo, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:47.895 --> 28:48.996
Join us next time.

28:49.330 --> 29:03.593
on Veterans of the Valley.
