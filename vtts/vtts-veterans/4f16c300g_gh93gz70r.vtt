00:06.005 --> 00:29.846
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.866 --> 00:30.848
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.756 --> 00:45.242
Captain Yolanda Kozlowski witnessed much of World War II working under a Red Cross tent, a triage nurse for the 100th Evacuation Hospital, attached to General Patton's Third Army, marching through France and Belgium on to Germany.

00:45.863 --> 00:49.630
Her memories of the war are those of good times and the saddest times.

00:49.897 --> 00:55.222
One of those good times was when then Yolanda Frisch met the young aviator, Ed Kozlowski.

00:55.342 --> 01:00.267
Four days after D-Day, that was a meeting that resulted in what has now been a 60-year marriage.

01:00.387 --> 01:04.010
We welcome Captain Yolanda Kozlowski to Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.090 --> 01:06.433
Welcome, Yolanda, and thank you first off for your service.

01:06.493 --> 01:18.324
Let's go back to when you first decided to get into the military and get into the service, and it was something that your father was not real in favor of, so you had to sort of make him a promise, but eventually you got into the service.

01:18.364 --> 01:19.785
Sort of take us back to that time.

01:20.423 --> 01:29.622
Well, I promised my father, I talked to him about joining the army and he said he wanted me to wait one year to make sure that that's what I wanted to do.

01:30.203 --> 01:35.294
So I became a superintendent of nurses for a hospital in Charleston, West Virginia.

01:35.815 --> 01:39.563
I worked a year and I still hadn't changed my mind and I

01:41.416 --> 01:44.280
went to the Army and applied to get into the Army.

01:44.300 --> 01:44.921
Right.

01:44.941 --> 01:51.791
And I was told in a nice way that I had only limited service in the United States.

01:52.011 --> 01:52.873
Right, you had flat feet.

01:53.273 --> 01:56.538
Yes, I had flat feet and I had eyesight deficiency.

01:57.379 --> 02:00.864
And so I said, well, okay, I'll take that chance.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.710
And I was assigned to Fletcher General Hospital in Cambridge, Ohio.

02:04.970 --> 02:06.092
Right.

02:06.613 --> 02:08.335
That was an assignment you didn't like very much.

02:08.315 --> 02:12.526
Well, I was very upset, to put it mildly.

02:13.168 --> 02:15.373
Anyway, I went into the Army.

02:15.394 --> 02:18.401
At the time, they were changing from blues to khaki.

02:19.404 --> 02:24.437
And, of course, the Army said, we will furnish you with everything you need.

02:24.457 --> 02:25.159
So I...

02:25.460 --> 02:27.023
waited for the Army to furnish me.

02:27.083 --> 02:35.597
And in the meantime, I wore civilian clothes, which did not set very well with the superintendent of nurses at Fletcher General.

02:36.218 --> 02:40.986
And she kept asking me if I was going to buy, and I said, no, that the Army said they would furnish me everything.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.671
And I said, I'm waiting till they furnish me everything I need.

02:44.123 --> 02:46.906
And finally, I broke down and did buy some of the things.

02:47.026 --> 02:51.470
But at that time, they were changing from blue to cracky.

02:51.530 --> 02:56.654
So I didn't want to invest a whole lot of money into blue, which I wouldn't use again.

02:57.515 --> 03:01.298
And so finally, we got into the khakis.

03:01.318 --> 03:06.203
And I was assigned to Federal General Hospital, which made me very unhappy.

03:07.064 --> 03:14.130
And so I decided, well, we'll see what we can do.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.074
break rules, but I bent them.

03:17.176 --> 03:30.482
And of course, after I bent several rules, the chief nurse decided that I should be put on a detail, a group that was going to

03:30.462 --> 03:54.732
Camp Dix and so we went there and I was assigned to the 100th evac which was what I wanted to do anyway and I was going overseas that was your ticket overseas and we kept saying please let us go to Europe don't go to Pacific let's go to Europe and everyone was there because nobody knew exactly where we were going to go until we were on the water right and then they opened the

03:55.454 --> 03:56.935
the orders and that's where we went.

03:57.696 --> 04:03.081
And of course we had winter clothes and summer clothes and so we were prepared for both places.

04:03.501 --> 04:07.665
We landed at Swansea, England on February the 14th.

04:08.426 --> 04:23.740
And from there we went to Fleetwood, England and our unit which consists of over 300 people, the hospital there was assigned to a hotel and they also had places for the enlisted people which they lived

04:23.720 --> 04:27.926
in an area where the fishermen came in and out.

04:27.947 --> 04:32.353
And so we were told that we should prepare for D-Day.

04:32.814 --> 04:50.942
And as we did, we spent our time, which seems probably funny to people now, but we spent our time making packages of gauze and rollers of bandages and so forth, and putting them in trunks that we could have at each

04:52.829 --> 04:56.873
And so we did this for our spare time.

04:57.153 --> 05:01.277
And plus that time, we were allowed to go off on weekends.

05:01.698 --> 05:05.041
And I took every weekend off and went somewhere in England.

05:05.522 --> 05:09.165
And of course, my chief nurse said to me, where are you going?

05:09.205 --> 05:10.427
I said, I really don't know.

05:10.507 --> 05:12.829
I'm gonna get on the train and go somewhere.

05:12.849 --> 05:18.735
And she said, well, don't you think that's a little...

05:19.593 --> 05:21.195
not the thing to do.

05:21.716 --> 05:22.537
And I said, well.

05:22.558 --> 05:23.779
You wanted to see the country, right?

05:24.100 --> 05:29.087
I said, well, I may never get a chance to be in England again, so I'm going everywhere I possibly can.

05:29.108 --> 05:32.953
And so she didn't fuss and fume too much after that.

05:32.973 --> 05:35.998
She sort of let me go.

05:35.978 --> 05:39.262
I had to have permission from her to go on these weekend trips.

05:39.282 --> 05:39.523
Right.

05:39.543 --> 05:46.091
I know one of your problems that you had is you had a roommate that had a little bit of a drinking problem, you said, so you didn't want to hang around a whole lot.

05:46.111 --> 05:49.836
Plus, you wanted to, this would be your only chance to see the country of England.

05:49.856 --> 05:52.700
Yes, I had a roommate that really was an alcoholic.

05:52.720 --> 05:52.961
Right.

05:52.981 --> 05:54.503
And there's no ifs and ands about it.

05:54.543 --> 05:56.465
And I really didn't want to spend a weekend with her.

05:56.686 --> 05:57.066
Exactly.

05:57.306 --> 06:00.771
And so for that reason, I got every weekend I possibly could.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.532
Right, right.

06:01.552 --> 06:12.290
So much of your time in England, and this is very important that I don't think a lot of people realize, so much of your time in England was spent preparing for what you were going to do, and that was to go... After D-Day.

06:12.410 --> 06:18.259
Right, go after D-Day and to take care of the wounded and the soldiers.

06:18.720 --> 06:24.750
And a lot of that was preparing the supplies, how they would have to go, because you don't just create a hospital.

06:24.770 --> 06:27.214
You don't just get there and the hospital's all ready to go.

06:27.194 --> 06:29.277
all had to build it from the bottom up.

06:29.377 --> 06:38.390
We had to make sure that we had everything that we possibly could think of that we would put in this trunk so that we couldn't go to the corner store and say, well, give me a bandage.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.494
And so this was the reason that we did it.

06:42.155 --> 06:45.540
And we tried to think of things that we

06:46.246 --> 06:50.077
we could possibly run out of, that we didn't want to run out of.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.210
And so we did this for a long time, which was very nice.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.075
And so we had a good time doing it.

06:56.156 --> 06:57.640
All of us did it at one time.

06:57.772 --> 06:59.895
First thing you think about, I guess, is bandages.

06:59.955 --> 07:01.858
Okay, that's easy, bandages.

07:02.499 --> 07:08.768
Your medical supplies, but I mean, when you're building a hospital from the ground up, what are the kind of things you put in that trunk?

07:08.949 --> 07:11.092
You have to have slings for broken arms.

07:12.013 --> 07:17.261
And for head wounds, you have to have compressed bandages that are different than just ordinary bandages.

07:17.962 --> 07:19.324
And then you have to have...

07:20.924 --> 07:27.894
Well, a lot of compressed bandages, which you could wrap around wounded that would keep them together.

07:27.914 --> 07:31.419
And at that time being, they didn't have the supplies that they have now.

07:31.499 --> 07:35.725
You had to sort of make up your bandages so that you would have that for certain wounds.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.409
So that's what kept us going.

07:38.689 --> 07:42.274
Right, right, right.

07:42.507 --> 07:45.534
You had to get this all compact and ready to go.

07:45.554 --> 07:47.599
So a lot of your time was spent doing that.

07:47.639 --> 07:52.009
And then you did go overseas and you landed.

07:52.069 --> 07:52.991
Talk about where you landed.

07:53.011 --> 07:57.161
You landed in a very famous place in World War II, just beyond the beaches.

07:57.181 --> 07:57.421
Utah Beach.

07:57.782 --> 07:58.684
Right, Utah Beach.

07:58.804 --> 07:59.065
Yes.

07:59.365 --> 08:03.991
And I went back there 50 years later and found this place exactly where I landed.

08:04.011 --> 08:11.119
As a matter of fact, we've got coming up later in the show a photograph that I found in your book of you at Utah Beach 50 years later.

08:11.620 --> 08:16.266
Landed at Utah Beach, and the first town that you actually set up shop in was St.

08:16.286 --> 08:16.846
Mary Glees.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.368
Well, outside of there.

08:18.488 --> 08:19.349
Outside of there, right.

08:19.389 --> 08:19.690
But at St.

08:19.710 --> 08:20.230
Mary Glees.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.453
And we spent the first night in the graveyard.

08:22.433 --> 08:44.307
uh-huh talk about and the reason you did it outside because you were explaining to me the churches there were the churches there you could have spent the night in but they were very very cold it was they were colder outside they were colder in the churches than they were outside by the tombstones right and there wasn't anyone going to bother us yeah so you spent the first night in a cemetery yes did you get a lot of sleep that night

08:44.422 --> 08:44.943
Oh, yes.

08:45.443 --> 08:46.724
It didn't bother us.

08:47.806 --> 08:49.007
No one was going to bother you, right?

08:49.027 --> 08:49.467
No, that's right.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.248
It didn't bother us.

08:50.769 --> 08:51.029
That's right.

08:51.049 --> 08:56.635
This was just a few weeks, July the 15th, 1944, just a few weeks after D-Day.

08:56.995 --> 09:02.140
And you were, like I said, you were sleeping on the grass.

09:03.161 --> 09:08.447
What sort of characterized what France was like at that time a month after D-Day?

09:08.467 --> 09:10.489
I guess most of the fighting had gone inland, right?

09:10.549 --> 09:14.293
Well, a month after D-Day, they were only about 20 miles in.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.356
So actually the Germans were 20 miles away from where we were.

09:19.462 --> 09:21.533
So we weren't that far into France.

09:22.492 --> 09:25.576
And it was very touch and go at times.

09:25.676 --> 09:26.678
Right, you could hear the bombing.

09:27.058 --> 09:28.300
Well, they bombed St.

09:28.340 --> 09:32.366
Lowe and their bombs didn't accurately bomb St.

09:32.386 --> 09:34.008
Lowe exactly where they should have.

09:34.028 --> 09:36.311
And the bombs were about a mile away from us.

09:36.331 --> 09:37.834
Yes, yeah.

09:37.854 --> 09:40.177
There are some humorous times in your experience in the war.

09:40.357 --> 09:45.144
One time, I think you said you were at Utah Beach, you were coming back from a function or an event.

09:45.164 --> 09:45.324
A party.

09:45.444 --> 09:48.468
And you had a little accident going from boat to boat, is that right?

09:48.489 --> 09:49.870
Yeah, I fell between them.

09:50.311 --> 09:52.414
Uh-huh.

09:52.394 --> 09:54.076
That's something you don't want to do.

09:55.038 --> 10:05.834
But I did fall between these two boats and fortunately I had presence of mind because I have grown up on Lake Erie and it didn't bother me.

10:05.854 --> 10:09.059
And I thought, well, they have to have something hanging on the side of this boat.

10:09.519 --> 10:13.605
You know, I've seen boats out there and I knew they had a lot of wires and so forth.

10:13.625 --> 10:17.231
And I reached out and I got into the water just up to my waist.

10:17.892 --> 10:21.557
And of course the sailors there said, where are you?

10:21.757 --> 10:22.919
Down here.

10:22.940 --> 10:24.042
And they said, where?

10:24.363 --> 10:25.244
I said, down here.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.411
And they said, well, you can climb up.

10:28.491 --> 10:29.794
I said, no way.

10:30.235 --> 10:31.678
I said, you're going to come down and get me.

10:31.838 --> 10:33.281
I am not climbing up anywhere.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.945
So they came down and got me.

10:35.747 --> 10:37.009
I just was wet.

10:37.029 --> 10:38.753
But otherwise than that, I was in good shape.

10:39.053 --> 10:55.014
Yolanda, the 100th evacuation hospital was a unit attached to Patton's Third Army, and you did have occasion to meet General Patton, obviously probably one of the most famous and recognizable figures of all of American history.

10:55.034 --> 10:58.920
He was a rough old bird, just like he's characterized in the history books, right?

10:58.940 --> 11:06.830
Yes, he was, but he knew warfare, and he knew exactly where to go and what to do about it, and he did.

11:07.151 --> 11:08.993
He planned extremely well.

11:09.057 --> 11:19.233
He was probably one of the best people that we ever had in war that planned accordingly to what was necessary.

11:20.895 --> 11:26.003
And he was a very rough man, but I think he was a very good man.

11:26.523 --> 11:27.364
He was fair.

11:27.384 --> 11:27.705
Yes.

11:27.725 --> 11:28.787
Sometimes not nice.

11:28.807 --> 11:30.029
Not nice, but he was fair.

11:30.189 --> 11:30.670
That's right.

11:30.990 --> 11:31.471
Right.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.274
But you can't lead an army and be nice.

11:33.394 --> 11:33.895
That's right.

11:35.237 --> 11:40.406
Your hospitals, the 100 evacuations, sort of characterized that.

11:40.426 --> 11:45.174
I know there was surgery, there was medical, there was also psychiatric care, and you were a triage nurse.

11:45.194 --> 11:45.474
Yes.

11:45.494 --> 11:52.125
So sort of give us an idea of what these particular moving hospitals were like and what your particular job was.

11:52.561 --> 12:06.250
Well, being a triage nurse, you have to define whether or not this person is acutely ill or whether he needs surgery immediately or whether he can go back to

12:06.533 --> 12:12.038
to combat, and what you do as a triage nurse, the people that can go back to combat are treated first.

12:12.239 --> 12:13.179
Right, right.

12:13.199 --> 12:14.861
Which is very difficult.

12:14.881 --> 12:26.172
Which is very difficult sometimes, because sometimes you had to treat the less severely wounded because they could get on their feet quicker and go back to combat, and sometimes the more severely wounded had to wait.

12:26.653 --> 12:36.422
And you tried to save as many seriously wounded as you possibly could, but your hands were tied in many ways because you only

12:36.925 --> 12:41.435
you only had so much space in a tent and you only had two people attending these people.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.822
And that probably was about 60 people.

12:45.845 --> 12:49.072
And sometimes you couldn't do everything that you really wanted to do.

12:49.994 --> 12:53.702
I mean, you did the best that you could and you tried as hard as you could.

12:53.682 --> 12:56.807
I want to go to some pictures now that you supplied to us.

12:56.827 --> 12:59.551
You keep an album of your experience in World War II.

12:59.992 --> 13:03.717
And we've got some of the pictures that Yolanda has given us.

13:04.238 --> 13:05.940
And you can see them right there on the screen.

13:05.961 --> 13:09.566
That is a picture that I found of a young Yolanda Frisch.

13:09.586 --> 13:10.948
About how old were you in that picture?

13:11.215 --> 13:11.475
25.

13:11.536 --> 13:13.699
25 years old.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.600
And that was taken when?

13:15.442 --> 13:17.064
Before you went overseas?

13:17.084 --> 13:19.248
That probably was, no, that was taken in England.

13:19.268 --> 13:20.230
In England.

13:20.250 --> 13:20.550
Okay.

13:21.752 --> 13:22.012
Okay.

13:22.253 --> 13:22.814
Let's move on.

13:24.977 --> 13:26.039
You're on the left, obviously.

13:26.059 --> 13:26.279
Yes.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.047
This was, this was, well, I just,

13:31.820 --> 13:39.871
I have to laugh at it because this was someone that just came in and had a slight wound and we were treating him and this photographer took this picture of that and that was it.

13:40.372 --> 13:43.676
It was one of those kind of things that you said, well, I don't really need this.

13:43.917 --> 13:47.842
By the looks on the faces, it doesn't look like a real serious situation right there.

13:47.882 --> 13:49.685
It was not a serious situation at all.

13:49.805 --> 13:52.709
That was one of those that you just bandaged up and said, get on back out there.

13:52.729 --> 13:54.712
Yeah, we said, you're done, go.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.135
You're done, go, okay.

13:57.115 --> 13:58.817
Let's move on to the next picture.

13:59.498 --> 14:00.680
Oh, this was Christmas.

14:01.861 --> 14:02.201
Of 1944.

14:02.722 --> 14:03.423
Yeah.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.785
And that's Greenberg.

14:04.805 --> 14:06.187
That was one of my teammates.

14:06.427 --> 14:06.647
Right.

14:06.968 --> 14:09.291
And we made, oh, we all made snowmen.

14:09.351 --> 14:10.853
We thought, why not celebrate?

14:11.193 --> 14:14.537
And we got through making all these snowmen and so forth.

14:14.597 --> 14:16.400
And we moved the day before Christmas.

14:16.420 --> 14:16.760
I see.

14:17.341 --> 14:22.467
People talk, when they talk about the Battle of the Bulge, which was this time, they talk about how cold it was.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.512
So there's sort of an idea of what the terrain was like.

14:26.532 --> 14:26.953
It was cold.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.576
a pot-bellied stove in each tent.

14:31.237 --> 14:31.357
Right.

14:31.377 --> 14:37.326
And we were allowed one brick a week.

14:37.706 --> 14:38.327
Uh-huh.

14:38.347 --> 14:41.912
And this, I mean, one brick a week, which was four bricks for us.

14:42.213 --> 14:42.333
Right.

14:42.353 --> 14:44.155
And we would save it all at one time and make fudge.

14:45.998 --> 14:46.399
Okay.

14:47.160 --> 14:47.500
Well.

14:47.961 --> 14:49.162
That's resourceful.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.024
That's right.

14:50.084 --> 14:52.006
Let's move on to the next picture.

14:53.008 --> 14:56.012
Oh, this is Greenberg and I were rolling up our...

14:57.562 --> 14:58.763
Your sleeping bag.

14:58.783 --> 14:59.764
Your sleeping bag, yeah.

15:00.105 --> 15:03.629
And of course, you know with your sleeping bag, it was your luggage, it was everything that you had.

15:03.689 --> 15:05.651
Everything that you had, you put in your sleeping bag.

15:06.111 --> 15:07.733
And they look at them and they say, they're big.

15:07.753 --> 15:11.838
And I said, well, we had to put all our clothes in there, all our shoes, everything else went in there.

15:11.858 --> 15:14.180
So that's why they were not a small bag.

15:14.361 --> 15:14.561
No.

15:15.001 --> 15:15.942
I still have one.

15:15.962 --> 15:18.185
It was a two-person job to roll that up, obviously.

15:18.205 --> 15:19.126
Yeah, I still have mine.

15:19.166 --> 15:19.727
That's right.

15:20.728 --> 15:21.689
Well, you all were having fun.

15:21.749 --> 15:22.690
You still have that.

15:22.790 --> 15:23.010
Yes.

15:24.352 --> 15:25.053
What are you looking at there?

15:25.533 --> 15:27.315
Roses that somebody gave me.

15:28.038 --> 15:29.180
We won't have to say who.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.361
Your husband's here at the taping.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.105
He's seen it before.

15:33.305 --> 15:34.066
He's seen it before.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.508
He's seen it before.

15:35.548 --> 15:36.169
Right.

15:36.390 --> 15:36.710
Okay.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.172
I just thought that was a very good picture.

15:38.593 --> 15:39.634
Rose is in front of the tent.

15:39.934 --> 15:40.195
Right.

15:40.595 --> 15:40.776
Okay.

15:40.796 --> 15:46.724
Now, we hadn't talked about this yet, but towards the end of your time, you were actually invited to a party that was thrown by the Russians.

15:47.465 --> 15:51.210
And you went across the Elbe River to this party that was thrown by the Russians.

15:51.190 --> 15:56.133
And the one thing that you're gonna tell me is that in that picture, you're about the only sober one in that picture, is that right?

15:56.154 --> 15:56.636
That's right.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.007
I'm the only sober one in that picture.

15:59.172 --> 16:28.892
I mean when I got there the Russians had a very nice dinner and of course they served vodka and I sat next to a Russian lieutenant colonel and of course when they said prost everyone was supposed to drink the vodka and then they'd refill it and refill it and I looked at him and I said what would your wife do and he looked at me and he said well she wouldn't drink it and I said thank you very much.

16:29.598 --> 16:32.284
So you were the designated driver of that party right there.

16:32.424 --> 16:37.155
Well, yes, I was the designated driver's right.

16:37.536 --> 16:38.358
Okay, let's move on.

16:38.478 --> 16:39.681
I like this picture.

16:39.941 --> 16:42.848
You're the second from the left in this picture.

16:43.309 --> 16:46.155
And so you all were putting on a little show, is that right?

16:46.642 --> 16:53.011
Well, I, Colonel sort of got bored with what we were doing and he decided that we should have a show.

16:53.372 --> 16:58.900
So he assigned a Lieutenant who had experience putting on shows like this, which I didn't know.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.862
And he was from New York.

16:59.962 --> 17:03.988
So we put this show together and we had a good time.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.189
And we had a really good time.

17:05.350 --> 17:06.251
And those are all nurses?

17:06.652 --> 17:08.254
All nurses, they're all nurses.

17:08.314 --> 17:10.597
And you're the second one from the left.

17:11.138 --> 17:11.939
Where'd you get the dresses?

17:12.981 --> 17:15.965
At a costume place in Liverpool.

17:16.346 --> 17:16.446
Yeah.

17:17.303 --> 17:17.864
That's wonderful.

17:18.225 --> 17:18.486
Okay.

17:19.087 --> 17:20.310
Here's the picture that we talked about.

17:20.911 --> 17:23.858
This was, I guess, taken in what, 1995?

17:24.018 --> 17:24.259
Yes.

17:25.301 --> 17:26.384
And you went back.

17:26.404 --> 17:30.313
Talk about your visit back to Utah Beach.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.157
Oh, well.

17:33.065 --> 17:34.147
I know it was 12 years ago.

17:34.668 --> 17:35.530
It didn't seem like that long.

17:35.550 --> 17:40.299
Well, no, what I thought about more than anything else is it was such a clean beach.

17:40.319 --> 17:46.290
And when we landed, there was so much trash on the beach that you could barely walk between everything that was there.

17:47.152 --> 17:50.738
And this was so clean, I looked at it and said, I didn't know there was sand there.

17:51.861 --> 17:53.183
Yeah, yeah.

17:53.433 --> 18:01.124
It brought back, you know, we went from an LCI to an LST, which landed us there.

18:01.144 --> 18:03.006
And these are things that people don't realize.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.590
And we climbed down rope ladders from the ship.

18:06.591 --> 18:07.552
And this is another thing.

18:08.133 --> 18:13.180
I guess with the excitement and everything that went on, I almost fainted in my roommate.

18:13.379 --> 18:14.925
help me down the rope ladder.

18:15.366 --> 18:18.016
I mean, I think it was just excitement and everything else.

18:18.538 --> 18:22.533
But we got down, but we had to climb down these rope ladders from the ship.

18:23.256 --> 18:24.621
And that's not an easy thing to do.

18:25.073 --> 18:26.875
Exactly.

18:26.895 --> 18:42.956
You, you told me just to give people an idea of the enormity of what your job and the responsibility of this 100, the back hospital was, uh, you said that normally you would get in 300 to 400 a day, but sometimes you were even known to get a thousand a day in the hospital.

18:42.976 --> 18:44.578
That's right.

18:44.598 --> 18:45.439
That's overwhelming.

18:45.720 --> 18:45.940
Yes.

18:46.741 --> 18:47.342
Yes.

18:47.362 --> 18:47.622
Yeah.

18:47.838 --> 18:53.252
And we only worked eight hours a day because our colonel said that after eight hours, you were not efficient.

18:53.272 --> 18:57.764
And he felt that if we worked eight hours, that we were much more efficient at taking care of things.

18:58.887 --> 19:03.720
And you have no idea of the depth

19:03.700 --> 19:22.840
of caring that went on i mean it seems like you know you look at us and you think well you took care of those things but the caring that we had inside didn't show because as nurses you don't do it right right um

19:23.528 --> 19:32.918
You eventually went into Germany, about 20 miles from Berlin, set up shop there, and you talked about actually being strafed there because... Oh, yes, we were.

19:33.038 --> 19:33.819
War wasn't nice.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.523
That red cross sign on the top of tents... It only meant an invitation.

19:37.783 --> 19:38.224
That's right.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.685
It only meant an invitation.

19:39.705 --> 19:40.206
That's right.

19:40.226 --> 19:41.668
It didn't mean that it was a safe haven.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.069
Sometimes that meant you were a target.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.693
Right, and I did find bullets in my head.

19:48.135 --> 19:49.536
So they did strafe the tent.

19:49.803 --> 19:51.224
That'll get your attention.

19:51.244 --> 19:51.545
Oh, yeah.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.285
It doesn't hurt.

19:52.546 --> 19:53.366
Absolutely.

19:53.386 --> 19:53.586
Yeah.

19:54.127 --> 19:59.472
After the war was over, this was something that kind of rubbed you the wrong way.

19:59.492 --> 20:03.215
After the war was over, the men were sent home, but they forgot about about 8,000 nurses.

20:03.656 --> 20:05.618
They thought had been sent home, but you weren't.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.358
You were still there.

20:06.598 --> 20:07.499
Yes.

20:07.519 --> 20:08.480
In Reims, France.

20:08.780 --> 20:09.301
Uh-huh.

20:09.321 --> 20:12.324
8,000 of us.

20:12.344 --> 20:16.347
And believe me, when you have 10 weeks.

20:16.688 --> 20:17.008
Right.

20:17.225 --> 20:22.053
that we were there, all of us, just women, you get a little tired.

20:22.734 --> 20:29.626
So we finally yelled loud enough that somebody from headquarters came down and said, oh, you are all supposed to be home.

20:29.927 --> 20:32.271
And we said, well, then what are we doing here?

20:32.291 --> 20:33.753
Right, right, right.

20:33.773 --> 20:34.475
So he sent us home.

20:34.675 --> 20:35.657
Finally sent you home.

20:35.677 --> 20:37.039
But you got an extra...

20:37.306 --> 20:39.649
eight-week tour, eight to ten-week tour there.

20:39.669 --> 20:41.632
Yes, which we didn't want.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.094
Right, right.

20:43.114 --> 20:59.837
Yolanda, you talked about the horrors of war, which obviously you saw as a triage nurse, but during the time after the near war's end, you came in contact with some concentration camps, and you saw some things obviously that you'll never forget.

21:00.610 --> 21:01.011
Yes.

21:01.912 --> 21:10.203
After the war was over, of course, the liberation of the concentration camps, we took care of the ones that were there.

21:10.223 --> 21:16.832
But what I remember more than anything else, and it still bothers me, is the smell of burnt flesh.

21:18.013 --> 21:24.762
And when I smell burnt meat and so forth, it triggers that memory.

21:25.501 --> 21:34.833
And you see these people and when you think that you've got a room eight by 10 stacked with bodies, I mean, you don't forget this.

21:34.853 --> 21:35.013
No.

21:35.754 --> 21:40.560
And you see these people that hung on and hung on finally to be liberated.

21:43.303 --> 21:48.910
And you talked about one time about actually being on a road and just seeing

21:49.210 --> 21:51.674
Soldier after soldier after soldier walking the other way.

21:51.694 --> 21:53.597
They were walking hundreds of miles to get home.

21:53.617 --> 21:53.778
Oh, yes.

21:54.358 --> 21:57.704
Well, these people were from Slovenia and Croatia.

21:57.884 --> 22:05.176
And they had been slaves of the Nazis working in factories, and they were on their way home.

22:06.238 --> 22:07.500
And they thought nothing of it.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.203
I mean, they were ready to go.

22:11.106 --> 22:14.712
And they just lived off the land as much as they could.

22:14.810 --> 22:17.414
I want to switch gears and talk about a happier subject.

22:17.434 --> 22:23.925
We talked about how you met this aviator, Ed Kozlowski, four days after D-Day.

22:23.965 --> 22:24.826
You all met each other.

22:24.846 --> 22:36.706
You went to a party, I believe, and kind of got to know each other, and you agreed that you all would write back and forth, and you did, but you actually didn't see each other again until back in the States after the war was over, right?

22:36.726 --> 22:38.789
We did not see each other until after the war was over.

22:38.969 --> 22:39.450
Right.

22:39.430 --> 22:48.772
And then I wrote Ed during spring break at the university he was attending and said, how about letting me come up and see you?

22:48.792 --> 22:52.561
And of course my mother and father are going, I said, I'm 25 years old.

22:52.781 --> 22:54.064
I can go where I wanna go.

22:55.242 --> 22:56.705
And so I went to see him.

22:56.965 --> 23:00.050
And we decided that we liked each other and we carried on a correspondent.

23:00.531 --> 23:07.043
And then I went to Milwaukee and applied for a job at the VA hospital, which they hired me.

23:07.063 --> 23:08.726
And we decided we would get married.

23:08.766 --> 23:14.095
But I said I would wait one year before I would marry Ed because I felt that we needed to know each other.

23:14.902 --> 23:16.324
And we waited a year and got married.

23:16.344 --> 23:17.286
How logical of you.

23:17.326 --> 23:18.828
That's right.

23:19.029 --> 23:20.311
And that was in August of 1947.

23:20.431 --> 23:26.020
So in this year, 2007, you all are celebrating your 60th anniversary.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.102
So it worked out.

23:27.122 --> 23:29.666
It evidently worked out, worked out pretty good.

23:30.207 --> 23:30.708
It really did.

23:31.269 --> 23:35.095
Talk about you and Ed and your careers after the war.

23:35.115 --> 23:41.365
You continued to nurse and and how you all eventually got down to College Station and both of you working for Texas A&M.

23:42.239 --> 23:48.418
Well, Ed finished his degree at Marquette University and then he was hired by

23:49.698 --> 23:51.301
I can't remember.

23:52.964 --> 23:56.790
But anyways, Republic Steel in Cleveland, Ohio.

23:56.810 --> 24:01.879
And so we went to Cleveland to live and bought a house in Euclid.

24:01.899 --> 24:06.527
And that didn't work out quite what he wanted to do.

24:06.828 --> 24:08.350
Then he went to work for Sherwin-Williams.

24:09.612 --> 24:14.541
And he worked there for a number of years.

24:14.521 --> 24:34.892
He had the opportunity to do something else and then he was in between looking for a job and trying to figure out where we really wanted to be and there was a ad and I think it was in the Wall Street Journal and it was for Texas A&M as a

24:35.935 --> 24:42.103
charge of maintenance for the Texas A&M University.

24:42.384 --> 24:44.427
And I said, why don't you apply?

24:44.447 --> 24:45.889
And he said, well, I'd never get hired.

24:45.929 --> 24:46.910
And I said, how do you know?

24:47.471 --> 24:48.492
I said, go ahead and apply.

24:48.532 --> 24:49.153
He did.

24:49.413 --> 24:51.136
And he got hired.

24:51.496 --> 24:55.342
And so that led to me coming down to Texas A&M.

24:55.782 --> 24:57.825
And then I applied at

24:58.733 --> 25:02.058
the employment office and the first thing they said to me is, do you type?

25:03.280 --> 25:08.207
And I looked at them and I said, I don't think I'd ask that to everybody that came in here.

25:08.227 --> 25:09.188
And they said, why not?

25:09.308 --> 25:12.092
And I said, for the very simple reason, not everybody types.

25:12.373 --> 25:16.719
I said, and besides I have an RN, which I don't have to type.

25:18.361 --> 25:21.045
And so anyway, I applied for a job and

25:21.025 --> 25:30.660
or position, and they said to me, well, you can work at the, I was gonna say Quack Shack, but you know what I'm talking about.

25:31.401 --> 25:41.717
And so I went there and I interviewed, and this woman who interviewed me gave me the feeling that she really didn't want me there.

25:42.389 --> 25:46.895
And I'm going, why should I work somewhere where I'm really not wanted?

25:47.896 --> 25:50.980
So I came back and I said, well, that's not exactly what I want to do.

25:51.040 --> 25:55.966
And they told me that this was, they had an opening at the veterinary school.

25:56.787 --> 25:59.110
And I said, well, let's go see what it is.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.254
So I went and I applied and I got it.

26:02.334 --> 26:07.401
And the man who hired me said, how many years are you going to stay?

26:07.421 --> 26:08.582
And I said, 10 years.

26:08.562 --> 26:10.445
He looked at me and he said, 10 years?

26:10.465 --> 26:21.199
And I said, yes, I will stay 10 years because at that time I was 57 years old and I figured that by the time I got to be 67, I should be retiring.

26:21.980 --> 26:32.755
And so he employed me and I went to work for the veterinary school and I did experimental surgery and research.

26:33.276 --> 26:33.396
Right.

26:33.416 --> 26:34.317
And you were there?

26:34.786 --> 26:38.257
woman of your word and you were there 10 years and you retired.

26:38.277 --> 26:40.665
There's so much more that we could talk about, but we're out of time.

26:40.785 --> 26:42.772
You and Ed have a daughter and you have two grandchildren.

26:42.812 --> 26:44.357
I know you're very proud of all of them.

26:44.675 --> 26:48.261
But thank you very much for your service, Yolanda, and thank you for being our guest today.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.943
Well, thank you very much for having me.

26:49.963 --> 26:50.324
All right.

26:50.704 --> 27:02.864
Yolanda Kozlowski is a woman of determination and skill, and the war was won because of soldiers like her, soldiers who saved the lives of other soldiers and thus allowed generations of families to grow.

27:02.884 --> 27:07.691
We salute Captain Yolanda Frisch Kozlowski for her service, as we do all veterans.

27:08.392 --> 27:09.334
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:09.354 --> 27:11.998
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:58.942 --> 28:03.180
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present,
