¶¶

00:36.582 --> 00:38.165
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.365 --> 00:39.367
I'm Tom Turpeville.

00:39.968 --> 00:46.119
Most local folks know Larry Stewart today for his public service as a member of the College Station City Council.

00:46.140 --> 00:51.089
But long before he ever thought about entering local politics, he served 20 years in the U.S.

00:51.169 --> 00:52.271
Navy as a pilot.

00:52.291 --> 00:57.300
Most of those years flying the P-3 patrol plane, a 1965 graduate of the U.S.

00:57.380 --> 00:58.422
Naval Academy.

00:58.402 --> 01:03.450
The first six months of his service was flying missions out of the Philippines to Vietnam during the war.

01:03.910 --> 01:08.738
The remaining 19-plus years sent him most anywhere there was an 8,000-foot runway.

01:09.218 --> 01:12.824
He spent two and a half years based on the carrier USS Lexington.

01:13.204 --> 01:18.392
Yeah, the Lex, as it's well known today to many a tourist to the Corpus Christi area.

01:18.412 --> 01:23.039
It's a fascinating military career, and we welcome Larry Stewart to Veterans of the Valley.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.323
Larry, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:25.343 --> 01:27.666
You grew up in Bay City, went to Lamar High School.

01:27.646 --> 01:31.791
Came to A&M for a year, but that $500 a year tuition was just too much for you.

01:31.811 --> 01:33.713
You had to find a free education somewhere, right?

01:33.894 --> 01:34.675
It was too much money.

01:34.775 --> 01:38.299
Cut in my doggone automobile fund.

01:38.319 --> 01:39.741
So you applied to the Naval Academy.

01:39.801 --> 01:45.868
I guess Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson at the time helped you get in, and you went to the Naval Academy.

01:45.888 --> 01:49.092
Talk about your career at the Naval Academy back in those days.

01:49.112 --> 01:54.018
Well, the Naval Academy really wasn't too much different, I believe, than what it is today.

01:54.158 --> 01:56.421
They had some nice, newer buildings.

01:56.857 --> 01:57.818
They had ladies there.

01:58.219 --> 01:58.800
Yeah.

01:58.820 --> 02:02.064
And they took away all the big guns that we had when I was there.

02:02.505 --> 02:02.966
Right.

02:02.986 --> 02:06.130
We had a lot of five-inch guns, stuff off the ships.

02:06.230 --> 02:11.538
But while I was there, the powers that be decided that we didn't need those things anymore because it was all going to be missiles.

02:12.179 --> 02:15.223
Of course, nobody paid attention to Vietnam five years later.

02:16.585 --> 02:18.748
But then we're using all the same things all over again.

02:19.088 --> 02:19.449
Right.

02:19.469 --> 02:21.071
Still played Army every year, though, right?

02:21.151 --> 02:21.912
Oh, yes.

02:21.952 --> 02:23.134
When I played, well,

02:23.671 --> 02:25.132
We beat them once.

02:25.152 --> 02:26.814
That's not how I was there.

02:26.834 --> 02:29.496
Roger Stalbuck was very nice to have on your team.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.277
Oh, that's right.

02:30.297 --> 02:32.699
That would have been right around the same time.

02:32.839 --> 02:33.840
He was a classmate.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.361
He was a classmate of yours.

02:35.381 --> 02:35.761
That's right.

02:35.861 --> 02:38.644
Then he did his service before he went to the Dallas Cowboys.

02:38.664 --> 02:39.344
I remember that.

02:40.185 --> 02:45.189
Four years at the Naval Academy and then to Pensacola for pilot training the next September.

02:45.790 --> 02:50.173
You wanted to fly the 81 Sky Raider, but you got pretty much your second choice, the P-3.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.294
Talk about that airplane.

02:51.334 --> 02:53.256
It's a four-engine prop

02:53.675 --> 02:57.041
Four-engine turboprop airliner derivative.

02:57.602 --> 03:03.972
The P3 is 88 inches shorter than the Lockheed Electra, which it spawned from.

03:04.773 --> 03:08.440
And the wings are significantly beefed up.

03:08.460 --> 03:11.465
The engines are also a bit more powerful.

03:11.765 --> 03:15.852
You're dealing with basically 10,000 shaft horsepower engines.

03:15.872 --> 03:16.493
Four of them.

03:16.827 --> 03:21.532
but it takes so much power to drive the propeller, your actual rated power is only 4,600.

03:21.632 --> 03:28.099
But it's still a three-engine airplane design, but you've got four engines on it.

03:28.119 --> 03:32.304
So we've wandered around on three engines most of the time, sometimes two.

03:32.324 --> 03:39.431
But at the same time, the airplane, it was limited on how much power you could put on it because you could tear the wings off of it.

03:39.451 --> 03:39.571
Right.

03:39.591 --> 03:42.675
So it's kind of like the old Electra, but smaller and more powerful, right?

03:42.695 --> 03:43.435
Yes.

03:43.456 --> 03:44.877
Exactly.

03:45.127 --> 03:46.129
Durable airplane.

03:46.149 --> 03:49.936
I think you told me they were built in 1962, and they're just now phasing them out, right?

03:50.036 --> 04:02.360
They started in 61, 62, and just now, the next two or three months from now, they're going to receive the first replacement airplane, which is a twin-engine Boeing jet.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.504
So that's over 50 years.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.606
That's pretty good to reduce it.

04:05.626 --> 04:06.207
That's not bad.

04:06.423 --> 04:09.888
July of 67, a replacement training squadron in Maryland.

04:09.908 --> 04:14.014
And at first, when you got your first assignment to the East Coast, you thought, well, I'm going to Europe.

04:14.034 --> 04:15.156
I'm not going to Vietnam.

04:15.176 --> 04:16.778
But they pulled a switch on you, right?

04:16.798 --> 04:22.987
It was a real switcheroo because I checked into Navy Jacksonville and was looking for my squadron.

04:23.047 --> 04:23.748
It wasn't there.

04:23.909 --> 04:30.919
And the duty officer hands me this big folder and says, we've been waiting for you, Lieutenant.

04:31.259 --> 04:31.540
Go.

04:31.560 --> 04:31.620
Go.

04:32.832 --> 04:34.634
And I was kind of like, where is it?

04:34.654 --> 04:36.075
You're going west.

04:36.095 --> 04:37.016
To Travis Field.

04:37.036 --> 04:37.916
To Travis Field.

04:37.996 --> 04:42.520
And basically 48 hours after I checked in, I was flying over Vietnam.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.444
After you checked in on the east coast, you were flying towards Vietnam.

04:47.725 --> 04:50.808
You were not based in country.

04:50.848 --> 04:52.069
You were based in the Philippines.

04:52.089 --> 04:55.572
And you flew your missions every night from the Philippines, unless there was bad weather, right?

04:55.652 --> 04:55.852
Right.

04:55.952 --> 04:59.275
We normally flew out of the Philippines.

04:59.295 --> 05:02.738
You launched just before sunset and worked up and down the coast.

05:03.545 --> 05:14.824
When there was a major storm out in the Gulf of Tonkin, that area, then they would move us over to someplace like Da Nang or Cam'ron Bay airfields.

05:14.844 --> 05:26.363
And we were just up and down the coast every night looking for gun runners, smugglers, or coming in and providing the

05:26.832 --> 05:32.824
flares, those huge lights that prepare flares for people to work under.

05:33.164 --> 05:43.404
We normally would go in and drop the flares and then the fighter bombers would work under the flares, which is a very unusual sight to see because the guy comes, they're out in the dark, you can't see them.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.410
All of a sudden the fighter comes in under the flare

05:46.846 --> 05:52.151
dropping his weapons, whatever he's doing, and it's broad daylight under the flares.

05:52.171 --> 06:00.278
These are the flares that you all had dropped, and then you all go high, and you're looking down to see not only the effect of the flares that you dropped, but then what was going on underneath that.

06:00.298 --> 06:03.441
You'd watch what was going on underwards, and it was quite interesting.

06:05.062 --> 06:14.811
And for us, it was nice because as long as you followed the rules, and that was a big thing for many people in Vietnam, and particularly for the patrol planes,

06:15.112 --> 06:17.795
If you follow the rules, nobody's gonna get hurt.

06:17.815 --> 06:19.977
If you did not follow the rules, you would get hurt.

06:20.638 --> 06:26.364
They killed two crews and aircraft of the squad that relieved us.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.306
Happened just that way.

06:27.386 --> 06:32.972
They violated some procedures and got shot down.

06:33.132 --> 06:35.415
There were a couple of crews of folks that you knew.

06:35.435 --> 06:36.356
Yes, I knew.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.156
That you knew very well.

06:38.678 --> 06:38.878
Right.

06:41.321 --> 06:42.182
Yes.

06:42.550 --> 06:46.479
I've been trying to recreate in my mind the dropping of the flares and what that sight looked like.

06:46.760 --> 06:55.199
You talked about the P-3 and how you were a pilot, but you really had to be trained at all positions, whether it would be bombardier, navigator, just about all areas.

06:55.219 --> 06:57.184
You had to be trained to know how to do everything.

06:57.383 --> 07:24.758
the pilots were cross-trained and most of the crewmen were too to at least two different positions so that if anything happened to somebody on board the airplane there was somebody else who could always back them up right and you start off typically though as a navigator in those days and you flew in the airplane as a navigator you got some flight time too but most most of it was as a navigator and then you would

07:25.210 --> 07:32.663
move up to the co-pilot position and eventually move up to the plane commander or mission commander.

07:33.043 --> 07:33.264
Right.

07:33.384 --> 07:35.227
That's the guy who was in trouble.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.372
In trouble or whatever, responsible for the airplane all the time.

07:38.572 --> 07:39.274
Exactly.

07:39.294 --> 07:41.638
Your tour of Vietnam was about six months.

07:41.658 --> 07:43.901
You came home right about the time of the Tet Offensive.

07:43.922 --> 07:44.102
Right.

07:44.603 --> 07:48.990
And you talked about when you came home from Vietnam and you're home and you're

07:49.865 --> 07:54.750
in this environment and you're sitting down and you're watching the reports of the war on TV.

07:54.791 --> 08:00.737
Sort of talk about how you related that to me and sort of the shock of what you were hearing versus what you knew as reality.

08:00.757 --> 08:03.240
It was utterly incredulous.

08:03.640 --> 08:09.127
Walter Cronkite was telling us that the war is lost and our side is getting beat up so terribly.

08:10.008 --> 08:16.375
And my first reaction and the rest of the guys too was, hey, we were just over there.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.878
We were watching those guys getting all blown to smithereens.

08:19.078 --> 08:19.298
Right.

08:19.868 --> 08:22.170
And it was just totally different.

08:22.530 --> 08:29.376
It was the view that the television crews were getting versus the views that the military were getting.

08:29.396 --> 08:30.237
It was totally different.

08:31.238 --> 08:33.660
And it was kind of a shock, to put it mildly.

08:33.860 --> 08:34.461
And disheartening.

08:34.641 --> 08:35.041
Yes.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.282
Oh, very, very disheartening.

08:37.143 --> 08:47.972
And my last mission out there, we were working at night with a Coast Guard cutter that was shooting at targets inland.

08:47.992 --> 08:49.774
And he had a super spotter.

08:50.024 --> 08:55.751
because he'd fire that little five-inch gun, bang, bang, and you'd see the shells burst in the trees.

08:56.191 --> 09:03.140
And then about his third or fourth shot, suddenly he's getting secondary detonations, which means he's hitting somebody's ammunition dump or fuel depot.

09:03.881 --> 09:08.126
And it's sort of like, we were doing this every night.

09:08.366 --> 09:09.748
So what was wrong?

09:09.768 --> 09:12.471
What was happening that we didn't know about?

09:12.788 --> 09:15.352
It was very strange and, like you say, very disheartening.

09:15.632 --> 09:17.796
Indeed, indeed.

09:18.997 --> 09:21.802
I asked you about some of your dicier missions when you were in Vietnam.

09:21.822 --> 09:28.031
And like you just referred to, yours were less than others because you did follow the rules.

09:28.051 --> 09:41.732
But you did have some times that were... Well, the most exciting ones were when you worked up off of North Vietnam and you're looking for high-speed targets right up and down the coast.

09:42.320 --> 09:47.745
And one night we were the only people around and the high speed target was coming south along the coast.

09:48.165 --> 09:52.789
They told us to go charging in, take a look at it and bomb it if need be.

09:52.810 --> 09:59.295
So we're coming in at 200 feet with bomb bay doors hanging open and a full load of weapons ready to go.

09:59.315 --> 10:07.563
And I'm in the right seat with the searchlight control, which was also the bombardier's position for that type of attack and sweeping with the light.

10:07.603 --> 10:12.107
And suddenly I come up and here's two fast boats right there in front of us.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.020
And thank God I recognized what they were because they were a pair of U.S.

10:16.121 --> 10:17.583
swift boats.

10:17.603 --> 10:20.949
And I just let go of the doggone handle.

10:20.969 --> 10:21.069
Yeah.

10:21.089 --> 10:22.832
And like it was a snake.

10:22.852 --> 10:22.952
Yeah.

10:22.972 --> 10:25.276
And it turned out later we knew the guys on the boat.

10:25.316 --> 10:28.281
They were kind of upset they got lit off by us with the searchlight.

10:28.301 --> 10:28.922
Right.

10:28.942 --> 10:33.609
But if we'd let go of those eight bombs, that would have been a mess.

10:33.770 --> 10:34.671
Yeah, indeed.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.656
Indeed it would.

10:38.328 --> 10:48.540
You came home from, you came back from Vietnam, let's say came home, came home for a while, but then you were off and for, like we said, 19 plus years, you flew and flew and flew some more.

10:48.580 --> 11:00.353
Like you told me, just about any place there was an 8,000 foot runway, you went, and this was Atlantic duty for the most part, North Atlantic duty for the most part, and you were looking for Russians.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.036
Yep, we'd look for Russians all the time and

11:03.539 --> 11:04.861
Generally speaking, we would find them.

11:06.062 --> 11:24.588
That's something that's never been documented in the books, probably because it's kind of difficult to write a dramatic story about an airplane just sitting up, hanging on the propeller, so to speak, and dropping the listening devices into the water.

11:24.608 --> 11:26.430
But that's what we did.

11:26.450 --> 11:32.719
And basically, there wasn't anything moving out in the Atlantic that we didn't know where they were.

11:33.155 --> 11:51.065
And it got to the point later that Admiral Garshkoff, who was the supreme Russian naval commander, made a very open statement that whenever he wanted to know where his submarines were, because they had terrible communications, all he did was ask his people, where's the P3s?

11:52.267 --> 11:54.972
And he knew where the airplanes were, then he knew where his ships were.

11:55.633 --> 11:55.753
Right.

11:56.054 --> 11:57.315
because we were with them all the time.

11:57.576 --> 11:58.497
Right, right.

11:58.817 --> 12:02.541
And we had a lot of fun chasing the submarines.

12:02.561 --> 12:06.646
I mean, the Russian subs were louder than ours so we could chase them.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.408
American submarine, you couldn't chase.

12:08.468 --> 12:10.090
He was too quiet.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.051
Exactly.

12:11.071 --> 12:12.933
And it was very interesting.

12:13.434 --> 12:23.445
You said that there was a time that what turned out to be the first Soviet nuclear attack sub, part of your squadron,

12:23.780 --> 12:27.524
caught a hold of that and you chased him all the way from Newfoundland to Cuba, is that right?

12:27.544 --> 12:28.024
That's right.

12:28.545 --> 12:40.297
One crew caught him broaching in a rainstorm and immediately identified who he was and got a sniff of the submarine so we knew what he looked like and sounded like.

12:40.697 --> 12:53.010
And then we followed that guy all the way from off of Newfoundland, a place called Argentia, down to Cuba when he went into Havana for his port call.

12:53.294 --> 12:59.698
And we were able to do that because we were based at Argentia, Newfoundland is an old airfield up there.

12:59.718 --> 13:01.967
And the rest of us were based in Bermuda.

13:02.027 --> 13:04.958
And Bermuda is an ideal place to cover the entire

13:05.377 --> 13:07.820
Eastern seaboard of the United States was what we did.

13:08.161 --> 13:08.742
Right.

13:08.762 --> 13:15.411
To give sort of an idea of when this was, you said that you were chasing subs off the coast of Bermuda when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.

13:15.471 --> 13:15.932
That's right.

13:16.072 --> 13:17.033
1969.

13:17.434 --> 13:19.897
Sort of give you sort of a point in history there.

13:20.418 --> 13:22.641
But the places you were based, you listed them before.

13:22.661 --> 13:23.682
I'll let you list them again.

13:23.722 --> 13:24.363
Some of the ones.

13:24.764 --> 13:25.865
Newfoundland.

13:25.885 --> 13:26.466
Newfoundland.

13:28.509 --> 13:29.250
The Iceland.

13:29.651 --> 13:30.091
Bermuda.

13:30.632 --> 13:34.337
Of course, Jacksonville, Florida, and later Brunswick, Maine.

13:34.655 --> 13:37.360
Lodges, Field, and the Azores.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.141
Greenland?

13:38.582 --> 13:39.944
Well, Greenland, we were just in and out of.

13:40.044 --> 13:41.066
We really weren't based there.

13:41.687 --> 13:42.989
You didn't want to stay in Greenland.

13:44.131 --> 13:47.537
And then Sicily, the base called Sigonella.

13:48.358 --> 13:52.285
Crete, an interesting base there called Suda Bay.

13:52.445 --> 13:57.253
And then occasionally you'd go up into France, into Germany.

13:57.622 --> 14:03.527
And of course the big base at Rota Spain is a very big patrol base.

14:04.588 --> 14:11.635
And Spain was a lot of fun because Spain was being right there at Gibraltar.

14:11.655 --> 14:16.339
Everybody going in and out of Gibraltar had to pass under your noses.

14:16.359 --> 14:24.826
And it became a point of honor that any submarine from any nation that went in and out of Gibraltar, we had to have him.

14:24.846 --> 14:26.548
You had to get a piece of that submarine

14:27.389 --> 14:39.670
There's a lot more of your career we want to talk about, but let's go to some photographs right now because we've talked about the P3 and we've got some photographs of the P3 and some of the young Navy pilot and there you are.

14:39.971 --> 14:41.273
About how old were you in that picture?

14:41.694 --> 14:43.677
About 40.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.296
That's way back when.

14:47.316 --> 14:48.399
This is much more fun.

14:48.419 --> 14:50.845
That's... Than pictures of you, you mean?

14:50.865 --> 14:52.208
Yeah, P3s are much more fun.

14:53.411 --> 14:54.072
That's a P3.

14:54.433 --> 14:54.513
Yep.

14:54.534 --> 14:55.095
Right there.

14:55.115 --> 14:58.403
It's the four turboprop.

14:58.423 --> 14:58.503
Yep.

14:58.523 --> 15:02.593
Again, quite similar to people who can remember back at that time when they would fly on...

15:03.046 --> 15:07.290
Braniff or Eastern Airlines or something like that when they fly in the Electra.

15:07.310 --> 15:08.672
Very similar body type.

15:08.692 --> 15:13.636
That's true, but you don't want to ride in a P3 because it's not comfortable.

15:13.656 --> 15:13.917
No.

15:13.937 --> 15:26.209
Because when they had the airplane crashes, like some people here may remember the one up in Buffalo, Texas, back in the early 60s, or actually 50s, late 50s, that was caused by a weakness in the wings.

15:26.249 --> 15:30.673
So the civilian airplanes, if they thought they would put a huge I-beam

15:31.042 --> 15:33.706
there is the main wing beam of the airplane.

15:33.727 --> 15:35.790
Well, that's what solved the problem in the airplanes.

15:35.830 --> 15:44.164
But the Navy, in all of their knowledge and knowing better, thought if one I-beam is good, two is better.

15:44.184 --> 15:48.912
So they put twin wing beams in a P3.

15:49.273 --> 15:54.221
The result is the only thing that flexes in bad weather are the engines.

15:54.261 --> 15:54.822
The engines

15:55.274 --> 15:57.757
as you see sticking out there, they will actually flip-flop.

15:58.678 --> 16:02.282
But the wing and the fuselage is just rock solid.

16:02.302 --> 16:05.505
It's just like you put something together, hammer and nails.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.727
It will not move.

16:06.747 --> 16:07.588
The people move.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.272
You can look back in the airplane when you went through some rough weather.

16:11.632 --> 16:13.274
You could see people flying through the air.

16:14.996 --> 16:17.699
So, yeah, it wouldn't be your normal passenger plane.

16:17.719 --> 16:19.661
No, it's not a good passenger airplane.

16:19.681 --> 16:20.702
It's a fun airplane.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.785
Yeah, but it's a military fighter.

16:22.965 --> 16:23.205
Right.

16:23.675 --> 16:25.257
This is another on the ground.

16:25.558 --> 16:35.813
This is down in Panama in 1977 for what we jokingly call the Nicaraguan campaign of 77, which is different.

16:36.634 --> 16:41.481
But you can see in this picture the airplane has this big searchlight on the

16:42.406 --> 16:44.390
Starboard wing that's that big ball.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.514
It's out the edge of the picture, right?

16:46.915 --> 16:49.740
10 million 10 million candle power, right?

16:50.902 --> 16:58.096
and Only other things in that picture you can really see there's a Umbilical hanging down from it.

16:58.116 --> 16:59.318
That's a power unit

17:00.344 --> 17:02.446
And that searchlight would be operated from the Wright Cedar?

17:02.486 --> 17:04.088
Yes, that's the Wright Cedar.

17:04.368 --> 17:12.978
Now, we talked about this in the opening, I did, and we're going to talk about this more, but this is the USS Lexington where you would serve later, and we're going to get to that in a minute.

17:12.998 --> 17:24.630
But this is the Lex, which I guess most everybody in Texas who has visited down to Corpus Christi know that it's in port there and quite a tourist attraction, and I know that

17:25.167 --> 17:27.589
two and a half years on the Lex were quite memorable for you.

17:27.849 --> 17:28.450
Yes, it was.

17:28.930 --> 17:29.230
Yeah.

17:29.251 --> 17:30.532
Lexington was a lot of fun.

17:30.932 --> 17:39.079
She was in far better condition than any ship that had sailed as much as she had deserved to be.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.921
But she had been maintained very, very well.

17:41.941 --> 17:43.243
Right.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.766
And she's just an outstanding vehicle.

17:46.826 --> 17:54.212
In fact, the way she stayed in good shape for so many years was that we had the battleship Alabama parked in Mobile, Alabama.

17:54.715 --> 17:56.577
and the ship was based out of Pensacola.

17:57.158 --> 18:09.510
When you needed spare parts, you went over to the Alabama and you got them off the Alabama because we'd worked a deal with these Alabama state people who maintained the park there.

18:10.612 --> 18:16.798
If we would give them something, they would give us free reign in their power plants.

18:17.519 --> 18:21.583
And as a result, some people call the Lexington, the USS Lexabama.

18:22.846 --> 18:23.847
Because of the parts.

18:23.967 --> 18:24.407
Yes.

18:24.427 --> 18:29.652
It's hard to believe, looking at that picture that we just saw, that I've had grandkids that have run all over that flight deck and all over those bridges.

18:31.534 --> 18:33.796
Well, that's the flight deck right there at the same ship.

18:33.956 --> 18:34.596
Exactly.

18:34.616 --> 18:37.559
That was the aircraft I flew when I was on board the ship.

18:37.579 --> 18:39.521
It's a little cargo airplane.

18:39.741 --> 18:40.021
Right.

18:40.802 --> 18:44.585
And the likes of it mainly Pensacola, Corpus Christi, sort of back and forth.

18:44.625 --> 18:48.148
And you flew off of it, going out and getting spare parts, like you said.

18:48.249 --> 18:49.029
Right.

18:49.089 --> 18:52.212
I was the senior watcher officer on the ship, so that meant I was...

18:52.411 --> 18:55.236
largely responsible for driving the ship most of the time.

18:55.556 --> 18:56.257
Right.

18:56.277 --> 18:59.964
And she was a lot, a heck of a lot of fun.

19:00.004 --> 19:12.104
We were at sea two weeks out every month, running back and forth between Pensacola and Corpus Christi based upon who had the most students who were ready for carrier qualifications.

19:12.364 --> 19:12.605
Right.

19:12.625 --> 19:18.655
Then when we didn't have students out of the training command, we were also the ready deck for anybody in the fleet who needed

19:19.259 --> 19:20.881
carrier qualification as well.

19:21.481 --> 19:26.006
So we could have a mixed bag of fighters and trainers, you name it.

19:26.026 --> 19:26.787
Right.

19:26.807 --> 19:28.409
Right.

19:28.429 --> 19:29.450
And this is our final picture.

19:29.470 --> 19:33.694
This is, well, this is later in your military career down in Milton, Florida.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.094
Right.

19:34.135 --> 19:39.740
That airplane is a T-34C, which is just now being replaced by the new T-6.

19:40.421 --> 19:42.383
But it's a wonderful little airplane.

19:42.403 --> 19:45.186
You said this is the first new airplane you ever got to fly, right?

19:45.206 --> 19:45.306
Yeah.

19:45.326 --> 19:46.127
After being in the Navy,

19:46.478 --> 19:49.763
For over 15 years, I finally get to fly a new airplane.

19:50.203 --> 19:51.225
And that was the trainer.

19:51.245 --> 19:52.607
And that was the trainer.

19:52.627 --> 19:54.329
And that little airplane is fun.

19:54.389 --> 19:57.994
If anybody ever wants to get air sick, that's the airplane to do it in.

20:00.318 --> 20:05.345
I want to backtrack a little bit after you served your time flying everywhere.

20:06.086 --> 20:07.568
Kind of a different job completely.

20:07.588 --> 20:13.296
You became a teacher and you taught ROTC at Lenser Polytech Institute in New York.

20:13.428 --> 20:15.050
and near Troy, New York.

20:15.811 --> 20:22.658
That was quite a duty, obviously, teaching young men to become military people, right?

20:22.678 --> 20:23.759
That was different.

20:23.779 --> 20:30.366
And at Rensselaer, it was different still because of the academic achievement of the students.

20:30.847 --> 20:41.899
When you would have a classroom and you could have 20, 25 students in your classroom, and you knew that quite possibly when you first met them,

20:42.436 --> 20:46.923
A quarter of those students were all perfect 800 SAT score people.

20:48.325 --> 20:53.132
And that gave you pause to realize just how smart these people were.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.354
Who's teaching who here?

20:54.374 --> 20:56.177
Exactly.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.861
They were terribly, terribly smart.

20:58.881 --> 21:05.170
So I used my opening statement was that I'm going to prove to all of you that you flunked the third grade.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.592
And that really got some comments.

21:08.612 --> 21:12.859
Well, the reason I could do that was back in those days, nobody had calculators.

21:13.460 --> 21:22.194
And you had to do a lot of plain old-fashioned mathematics, adding and subtracting, and spherical trigonometry and celestial navigation.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.580
And if you don't keep the columns straight, you will make errors.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.082
It's just death and taxes.

21:27.102 --> 21:30.327
Anybody who's tried to work in columns in accounting knows that.

21:30.548 --> 21:31.309
Right.

21:31.542 --> 21:38.830
When you're young and in college and all that, you don't think about that kind of stuff because you know more than that instructor up there.

21:38.871 --> 21:39.231
You do.

21:39.411 --> 21:39.712
That's right.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.272
Some of them did.

21:40.573 --> 21:42.575
And you had one guy that outsmarted the calculator.

21:42.595 --> 21:44.037
Oh, yeah.

21:44.057 --> 21:44.337
That's right.

21:44.357 --> 21:49.163
I had one guy outsmarted the calculator because all the calculators back then were base 10.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.867
And in that program, we worked in radian measure.

21:52.887 --> 21:53.027
Uh-huh.

21:53.243 --> 21:54.926
And I find him using a calculator.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.749
I kind of got upset with him.

21:56.769 --> 21:59.593
And then I said, no, let's see if he gets the right answers.

22:00.014 --> 22:06.764
He had all the right answers because he'd worked out the conversion factors from base 10 to radian.

22:06.784 --> 22:10.290
Anytime a student's that smart, he's got it.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.033
Some of your slower students there only had 760 to 780 SAT scores.

22:14.854 --> 22:15.634
Those are slow ones.

22:16.355 --> 22:18.177
Yes, some of your slower students.

22:18.777 --> 22:27.065
You taught there three years, and then it was to the Lexington in 1973, and we've talked a lot about that already, so we'll just go on.

22:27.186 --> 22:29.608
Navy War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

22:29.868 --> 22:31.730
And when I hear Newport, I know that.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.611
I vacationed there.

22:32.631 --> 22:33.572
That's not a bad gig.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.073
No, that's not bad at all.

22:35.093 --> 22:36.755
That's one of the best deals going.

22:37.235 --> 22:40.058
It's a one-year sabbatical, more or less.

22:40.510 --> 22:46.916
You've got some of the real cream level instructors, both military and civilian.

22:46.936 --> 22:59.427
And you've also got pretty much the cream of the officer corps as well, because you have not just Navy, you have Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Foreign Services.

22:59.947 --> 23:04.511
And the Foreign Service were just fascinating, the kind of people you got there.

23:05.252 --> 23:09.876
Like my favorite, it's almost a joke, is we had one Japanese

23:10.075 --> 23:12.998
senior officer who had come to the U.S.

23:13.839 --> 23:17.123
Naval War College after doing the Indian War College.

23:18.304 --> 23:28.816
And he enjoyed telling a story how their major war game was how to invade a place called the Andaman Islands down in the Indian Ocean.

23:29.657 --> 23:32.801
And he told them how to do it in his report.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.063
And they didn't like what he said.

23:35.444 --> 23:36.505
He said, you can't do that.

23:37.008 --> 23:42.838
And he said, oh, I stood up and told him, that may be true, but that's how my father took this place in 1941.

23:43.379 --> 23:47.727
He got his grade.

23:49.069 --> 23:49.430
Indeed.

23:50.292 --> 23:55.721
From there, Patrol Squadron in Maine, where you were back with the P-3s and looking for those 8,000-foot runways again.

23:55.741 --> 23:59.788
So it was sort of a full circle type of thing that you sort of come back to what you were doing before.

23:59.868 --> 24:00.089
Right.

24:00.950 --> 24:01.311
And...

24:02.067 --> 24:09.216
The P3 airplane, once you get into it, it's addictive because it is an airplane that's deceptive.

24:09.296 --> 24:13.220
It does things that you wouldn't expect it to do.

24:13.701 --> 24:22.872
Like everybody has seen the maneuvers in Top Gun where Tom Cruise pops the nose up of the Phantom and everybody goes past him.

24:23.373 --> 24:25.375
You could do the same thing in a P3.

24:25.827 --> 24:28.811
except you didn't pull your nose up, you pulled the power back.

24:29.051 --> 24:29.732
Right.

24:29.752 --> 24:37.082
And all those four propellers would just come around flat to the front, and you would immediately go back to the edge of the stall.

24:37.182 --> 24:40.106
Anybody who was following you goes sailing past you.

24:40.126 --> 24:40.346
Right.

24:40.746 --> 24:46.053
And we used to like to play that game quite often with anybody flying a Phantom because the Phantom could not slow down.

24:46.254 --> 24:47.235
Exactly.

24:47.255 --> 24:49.878
And the Air Force pilots did not appreciate us doing that.

24:49.898 --> 24:53.703
The Navy pilots knew what was coming when they got in too close to the P-3.

24:53.923 --> 24:54.224
Right.

24:54.765 --> 24:55.125
They were fun.

24:55.392 --> 25:00.519
You thought about one place you went, the Ascension Islands, was about as far away from anywhere that you've ever been, right?

25:01.079 --> 25:01.360
Yes.

25:03.142 --> 25:05.205
In the middle of nowhere, literally, right?

25:05.345 --> 25:11.433
You've got to look up the Ascensions on a globe to appreciate how far out in the middle of nowhere you are.

25:11.453 --> 25:16.159
It's eight degrees south latitude, almost dead center in the South Atlantic.

25:16.740 --> 25:22.007
And the only reason anybody's interested in it is because that was the British outpost to protect the

25:22.342 --> 25:22.662
St.

25:22.702 --> 25:26.047
Helena Island, which is where they were holding Napoleon.

25:26.067 --> 25:30.233
And that was the buffer to protect St.

25:30.253 --> 25:34.899
Helena, which is 600 miles further south and even more out into the boondocks.

25:35.219 --> 25:37.763
You said the nearest alternate runway was three hours away.

25:38.283 --> 25:38.724
Right.

25:38.784 --> 25:40.907
And that was in Liberia, which really wasn't too friendly.

25:41.292 --> 25:42.613
Just got a couple of minutes left.

25:42.773 --> 25:50.741
Milton, Florida, where that last picture we saw was taken, that was back in trainers, and you taught instruments, taught acrobatics.

25:51.122 --> 25:51.242
Right.

25:51.262 --> 25:54.925
Yeah, where a student or two gave you a thrill or two every once in a while, right?

25:55.146 --> 25:55.446
Oh, yes.

25:55.466 --> 26:03.354
That was the guy who got to handle all of the problem people who could not handle acrobatics.

26:04.114 --> 26:07.738
And that generally meant that if you had one of those students, sooner or later in your

26:08.174 --> 26:11.600
remedial flight when they would get you into what's called a flat inverted spin.

26:12.200 --> 26:18.591
The T-34C was made to go stable state and spins and the airplane didn't care what condition it was in.

26:18.951 --> 26:19.673
It just spun.

26:20.314 --> 26:25.422
Well the students would get into these things by pulling too many G's in a loop.

26:25.482 --> 26:25.542
So

26:26.062 --> 26:26.843
You go up on top.

26:26.863 --> 26:32.552
On top of a loop in a normal airplane, you just ease back on the stick to keep them spinning.

26:32.572 --> 26:37.460
Well, these guys would keep pulling Gs, and the next thing you know, the airplane does this.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.805
And it's very exciting.

26:40.965 --> 26:41.927
Now you're in negative Gs.

26:42.007 --> 26:42.868
You're in negative Gs.

26:42.949 --> 26:43.690
Everything negative.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.414
But in the T-34C, we never told the students this.

26:46.895 --> 26:50.581
You just push the power fall, and the airplane flew it out of it.

26:50.601 --> 26:52.744
You made them think they'd messed up more than they really had.

26:52.825 --> 26:53.567
Well, they'd mess it up.

26:53.587 --> 26:54.709
It would have killed them.

26:57.496 --> 27:06.075
Interesting, sir, there you finally finished your career back in Corpus, finishing there as a synthetic officer working in charge of flight simulators.

27:06.476 --> 27:08.481
And there's a lot more to tell there, but we're out of time.

27:08.521 --> 27:09.062
But I know that

27:09.430 --> 27:13.217
working there is what led you onto the career that you had post-military.

27:13.317 --> 27:14.218
I know that.

27:14.359 --> 27:18.586
I went right straight from simulators in the Navy to simulators at the place that builds them.

27:18.786 --> 27:19.267
That's right.

27:19.427 --> 27:19.868
That's right.

27:20.089 --> 27:21.231
And a wonderful career it's been.

27:21.491 --> 27:24.516
And thank you for visiting with us and thank you for your service.

27:24.576 --> 27:25.919
It's very intriguing.

27:26.359 --> 27:26.680
Well, thank you.

27:26.913 --> 27:27.454
Thank you, Larry.

27:27.514 --> 27:28.215
Thank you for being here.

27:28.696 --> 27:33.864
Larry Stewart's love of flying made for a two-decade naval career that he obviously treasures.

27:33.884 --> 27:36.729
He flew proudly and he taught many others to do the same.

27:36.749 --> 27:43.800
We salute Larry Stewart for his service to the Navy and his country and for his dedicated service today on the College Station City Council.

27:44.481 --> 27:45.462
I'm Tom Turboville.

27:45.482 --> 27:48.347
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:10.636 --> 28:33.488
Thank you.
