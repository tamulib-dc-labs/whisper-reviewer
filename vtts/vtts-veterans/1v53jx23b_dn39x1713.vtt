00:10.443 --> 00:34.189
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.569 --> 00:35.590
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.295 --> 00:43.210
Before Al Rampmeier will talk about his year of military police service in Vietnam, he'll first talk about the men he served under.

00:43.671 --> 00:46.697
He speaks with pride of Generals Ray Lynch and Hal Moore.

00:47.058 --> 00:52.169
We speak of pride of Al Rampmeier's brave and varied service to the Army and now to his community.

00:52.189 --> 00:53.933
Meet Lieutenant Al Rampmeier.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.095
of the Brazos Valley.

00:55.235 --> 00:59.102
Al, first off, just thank you for your service, your service in Vietnam and your service now.

00:59.122 --> 01:02.529
And we're going to talk about all those things, but let's go back to your hometown.

01:02.569 --> 01:06.817
You grew up in Palacios on the coast, and eventually you got to Sam Houston State.

01:06.857 --> 01:10.403
Sort of take us quickly from that time to when you went to college.

01:12.205 --> 01:19.212
Well, I was in high school in Palacios and played a lot of sports and graduated from there.

01:19.273 --> 01:26.080
Went to Sam Houston and we graduated in three and a half years at Sam Houston.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.361
Almost made it through in three.

01:27.922 --> 01:41.436
But had to go to ROTC summer camp in Fort Sill, Oklahoma in the summer of 64 and got to meet a lot of the Aggies there and a lot of other individuals.

01:41.416 --> 01:45.863
That was six weeks of the hottest place I think I've ever been in, even hotter than Vietnam.

01:45.983 --> 01:47.725
That was like July of 64, right?

01:47.745 --> 01:48.647
It was July of 64.

01:48.967 --> 01:49.708
That was pretty hot.

01:49.728 --> 01:56.378
You were a distinguished military grad, I know, but you turned down your Army commission to take a reserve commission in military police.

01:56.398 --> 01:58.902
Sort of talk about that decision and why you went that way.

01:58.882 --> 02:04.609
Well, my RA commission, my regular army commission was armor and finance.

02:05.370 --> 02:10.998
And I had decided that perhaps the military wasn't going to be my career.

02:11.018 --> 02:17.506
And I wanted to find out a colonel over at the college said, well, you might want to try the military place.

02:17.526 --> 02:22.172
So they have a large, the number of men in that group

02:22.355 --> 02:29.212
are usually well-trained and they're pretty smart to work with, but you have a lot of difficult situations.

02:29.232 --> 02:36.229
And so with that, I took my military police commission and graduated in January of 65.

02:37.542 --> 02:43.387
And you actually entered the Army in March of 1965 in the military police.

02:43.408 --> 02:46.050
You went to Fort Gordon for basic and then to Fort Benning.

02:46.590 --> 02:50.174
And you were a second lieutenant assistant operations officer.

02:50.214 --> 02:53.677
Sort of talk about your work before you went over to Vietnam and what your duties were.

02:54.098 --> 02:57.661
Well, our duties were varied, of course.

02:58.902 --> 03:02.886
We handled such things as all the traffic control on the post.

03:02.906 --> 03:05.288
We investigated all the accidents.

03:05.690 --> 03:10.958
become duty officer not only at Fort Benning, but also Columbus, Georgia and

03:11.140 --> 03:15.425
Phoenix City, Alabama, which was sort of the nightlife over there.

03:16.105 --> 03:21.771
And many times we worked with not only the FBI, but with the state and local police.

03:22.292 --> 03:24.474
And so our jobs were varied.

03:24.514 --> 03:33.364
We went to helicopter crash scenes, car wrecks, investigated murders with our criminal investigative department.

03:33.384 --> 03:39.190
So it's pretty varied, even though I was only at Main Post Fort Benning for just a short time.

03:39.170 --> 03:42.775
This was around the time that people were first becoming aware of Vietnam.

03:42.795 --> 03:47.220
Lyndon Johnson was increasing the activity in Vietnam.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.165
And you were among some of the first groups to go to Vietnam.

03:51.185 --> 03:53.528
Sort of talk about that time, sort of how it came about.

03:54.269 --> 03:56.772
And you're going over to country.

03:56.792 --> 03:57.734
You went by boat.

03:57.754 --> 04:01.178
So sort of just take us through that time when you first went over to country.

04:01.833 --> 04:07.320
Well, the 11th Air Assault was actually the predecessor of the 1st Air Cav Division.

04:08.121 --> 04:21.158
And when President Johnson said that he was committing an air mobile division to Vietnam, then at that point, he did not call up the reserves or the National Guard.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.903
At that point, it became a tour of duty.

04:24.923 --> 04:28.347
And for the Army, it was 12 months.

04:29.862 --> 04:38.974
Consequently, a lot of the individuals that were in the 11th Air Assault that moved over to the first CAV, those with 90 days or less did not make the trip.

04:40.256 --> 04:45.583
There were a number that had just over 190 days.

04:45.603 --> 04:50.710
A lot of those, unfortunately, we lost during the Adrang battle.

04:52.392 --> 04:52.933
Right.

04:54.432 --> 05:06.880
I have received orders on like the 15th of July of 65 to report the next day across the post to the first or cab to the 545th MP company.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.606
And at that point about

05:10.227 --> 05:18.342
one-third of the CAV had to be made up from individuals they pulled from all over the United States.

05:18.362 --> 05:29.263
And about four of the military police lieutenants all came from different posts, Fort Campbell, Fort Bragg, Fort Jackson, and I came, of course, from Fort Benning.

05:29.283 --> 05:31.307
So we only had two officers

05:31.945 --> 05:44.520
in the military police company that were really there and uh when we showed up right and we were all new we had at that point we only had a month to get our people ready

05:45.918 --> 05:52.789
They brought out the M16, it was tested, and everybody got qualified in that.

05:53.490 --> 06:00.682
At that point, we had one brigade that was airborne and two leg brigades for the airborne people.

06:01.363 --> 06:08.334
And everybody was packing up things in metal connexes to be shipped.

06:08.574 --> 06:12.060
Barely got to know most of the men in my unit.

06:12.040 --> 06:19.011
11 of my men went in the advance party of 1,030, and the rest of them went on board ship with me.

06:19.471 --> 06:24.800
I had five days to get my wife home and to get settled and get back.

06:25.521 --> 06:29.827
And I left just as a movie.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.810
We were soldiers.

06:31.830 --> 06:34.875
They picked us up on buses, took us to Charleston.

06:34.855 --> 06:39.079
I got on board the USNS WMO Darby, named after General Darby.

06:39.880 --> 06:44.225
And we left on the 16th, went past Cuba.

06:44.345 --> 06:47.928
We had a Nautilus submarine behind us.

06:48.009 --> 06:50.051
We knew that.

06:50.071 --> 06:52.113
And we could see the gunboats in Cuba.

06:52.133 --> 06:52.994
Went through the canal.

06:53.855 --> 06:58.379
Right there, we saw four of our old Jeep carriers from World War II.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.082
They had our 450 helicopters.

07:01.062 --> 07:06.689
Went through the canal, went up to Long Beach, California.

07:06.709 --> 07:13.138
Our little troop transport had about 2,200 men on it, pulled up beside USS Enterprise.

07:13.158 --> 07:16.843
And we looked like a toy compared to that aircraft carrier.

07:18.024 --> 07:23.071
We were only in Long Beach for about 8 to 10 hours.

07:23.091 --> 07:28.318
And then we headed straight out to Quignon, Vietnam in the Central Highlands.

07:28.703 --> 07:35.269
So in all, about how long a trip was this from when you left, went all the way around through the Panama Canal, back to California and over?

07:35.289 --> 07:36.711
How long were you on the Derby?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.032
About 22 days.

07:38.052 --> 07:38.913
About 22 days.

07:41.816 --> 07:41.896
Yes.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.298
And you went ashore at Vietnam.

07:44.478 --> 07:48.021
I think you told me they just dropped you off right there on the shore.

07:48.062 --> 07:55.909
You found yourself in waist-high grass or shoulder-high grass and were told to go that way and you would find the base.

07:56.665 --> 08:01.961
You're a young man, you know, 22 days earlier you were in the safety of the United States.

08:02.041 --> 08:09.223
What do you remember your thoughts back then of what you'd gotten into, what was going to happen at that time?

08:09.355 --> 08:14.542
Well, actually, what happened is they had landing craft and they put us on these old landing craft.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.783
We landed.

08:16.444 --> 08:28.679
They did truck us to an airfield and then we got on helicopters and we helicoptered about 30, 40 miles into our what was now our main base, which was called Anke, the home of the first cab.

08:29.240 --> 08:36.509
And the advance party of a thousand people had hacked out what we call the golf course.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.772
They did not want to mess up the dirt.

08:38.752 --> 08:43.457
They wanted to keep the grass, so they chopped down shrub trees and stuff like that.

08:43.537 --> 08:44.718
And then that's what we started.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.742
But they landed us in real tall grass.

08:47.762 --> 08:49.664
And then they said, there's Hong Kong Mountain.

08:50.685 --> 08:51.686
Walk towards that.

08:51.966 --> 08:55.590
You'll find the company.

08:55.610 --> 09:02.117
And we were right at the base of the Hong Kong Mountain in what was called the division headquarters.

09:02.217 --> 09:03.038
Right, right.

09:03.018 --> 09:04.520
You had to build the base, though, right?

09:04.900 --> 09:08.825
We had to build the base, and that base was built from the ground up.

09:09.065 --> 09:17.876
And when you think of a division of over 16,000 people with support troops, it became massive over a period of time.

09:17.896 --> 09:24.925
But to let you know, yes, we were, needless to say, we were very nervous and scared.

09:24.905 --> 09:26.068
Exactly, exactly.

09:26.469 --> 09:32.205
One of your first tours, I guess it was, when you went over there, involved the 101st Airborne.

09:32.225 --> 09:33.528
You were with them for about a week.

09:33.548 --> 09:34.932
Talk about what that was about.

09:35.452 --> 09:44.890
The 101st Airborne sent a brigade over to Vietnam in July of 65, and they actually secured our area of operations.

09:45.851 --> 09:57.493
And so officers from the CAF went out, OJT, I went out with a military police unit, and it was called Operation Gibraltar.

09:57.794 --> 10:04.242
and the 101st Airborne had just stepped into a real bad situation.

10:04.262 --> 10:13.394
They lost a number of guys in a helicopter landing of a battalion, and they landed right in the middle of a North Vietnamese unit.

10:13.414 --> 10:15.377
Right.

10:16.117 --> 10:22.806
And during that time, we understood and started learning how to run convoys,

10:23.663 --> 10:36.379
bridge security, and of course, the typical military police functions when you're dealing with enemy, we have prisoners and captured materials, working with the interrogation team.

10:36.399 --> 10:47.553
You're touching on that, and I want you to be a little bit more specific, if you will, about the jobs, the various jobs of the military police, because it is a unique position and a unique job in the military.

10:47.573 --> 10:48.614
It was a little bit of everything.

10:48.654 --> 10:51.758
No day was exactly the same for you, right?

10:51.778 --> 10:52.759
Exactly.

10:53.195 --> 11:04.504
Being a division military police unit and of course then we were broken down by a platoon which is about 30 to 40 men depending on what time of the year we were over there.

11:06.089 --> 11:09.718
We were assigned to a brigade and I was assigned originally

11:09.698 --> 11:16.148
to the 2nd Brigade, which was commanded by Colonel Ray Lynch from Madisonville, Texas, a graduate of Sam Houston.

11:16.728 --> 11:20.654
And it had been World War II, Korea, and then now was commanding a brigade.

11:21.435 --> 11:25.441
And we originally were sent out with a battalion.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.686
We handled convoys 12 hours a day.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.028
12 to 14 hours a day.

11:31.048 --> 11:38.034
Then we also had a bridge to secure, and we were out there by ourselves.

11:38.235 --> 11:46.722
At that point, we only had about 16 men in our platoon that was out on the operation.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.845
And that was October time frame.

11:51.226 --> 11:58.673
But we also handled all of the typical military police duties in the division.

11:58.653 --> 12:09.825
which included keeping the town curfews or keeping the men away from the city until or from the town of Anke.

12:10.465 --> 12:22.878
And we had some unusual things happen, grenades going off in some of the bars, some of our guys being hurt, having to evacuate them and take care of them.

12:23.399 --> 12:25.521
And we also handled any other

12:25.501 --> 12:28.224
problems that would be typical of a police unit.

12:30.266 --> 12:36.273
Military police, we handled, as I said, that captured any enemy that was captured.

12:37.335 --> 12:40.178
And we had all the captured weapons.

12:40.238 --> 12:41.960
We worked with the interrogation teams.

12:43.061 --> 12:48.928
We also provided security for our brigade tactical operations center.

12:49.689 --> 12:53.533
And at the same time, we also acted as an infantry unit.

12:53.513 --> 13:10.017
in the brigade tactical area of operations, and we also provided security for anyone that came into our area that was higher ranked, like the general and above.

13:10.117 --> 13:14.143
You mentioned Colonel Lynch, Colonel William R. Lynch, went by Ray Lynch.

13:14.183 --> 13:22.035
I know he was one of your commanders who meant an awful lot to you, and his wife, who's still alive and still lives in Madisonville now,

13:22.015 --> 13:25.318
Talk about Colonel Lynch and what kind of a leader he was.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.405
Well, Colonel, and I refer to him as Colonel, although he did retire as a Brigadier General.

13:32.426 --> 13:36.049
Colonel Ray Lynch was a unique individual.

13:37.731 --> 13:43.256
Was described as one of the best tacticians, along with Colonel Hal Moore.

13:44.057 --> 13:48.782
And I went to many of a briefing with

13:51.462 --> 13:52.544
Colonel Lynch.

13:53.205 --> 14:00.718
And his previous experience was so helpful to the unit during that time.

14:00.738 --> 14:07.570
And set in on his briefings was something that I'll never forget.

14:07.850 --> 14:09.373
And of course, we took our orders from them.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.099
And I had men that

14:13.079 --> 14:14.861
were with him every place he went.

14:16.163 --> 14:17.885
And he had his own helicopter.

14:17.986 --> 14:22.351
And of course, he had his battalions out there maneuvering.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.215
In his brigade, he had three battalions.

14:26.237 --> 14:29.982
And in most battalions, there were four infantry companies.

14:31.063 --> 14:33.987
So he was quite an individual.

14:35.229 --> 14:38.853
And I hated to see him have to move on.

14:39.374 --> 14:41.517
But he was promoted to general.

14:41.497 --> 14:45.545
And in March, right after Operation White Wing Masher.

14:45.825 --> 14:46.086
Right.

14:46.106 --> 14:49.052
And I've stayed in touch with his wife.

14:49.072 --> 14:52.919
I found him in 1994.

14:53.019 --> 14:53.200
Right.

14:54.162 --> 14:55.384
In fact, on November 11th.

14:56.085 --> 14:57.809
And went over and spoke with him.

14:57.849 --> 15:00.775
He had just had a stroke.

15:01.456 --> 15:02.037
And...

15:02.017 --> 15:05.082
Mrs. Lynch and I started a relationship of talking.

15:06.444 --> 15:11.433
In fact, I was just over to see her two weeks ago, and she's 94 years young.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.795
Oh, and doing well.

15:12.915 --> 15:23.012
And she and Julie Moore, from the movie We Were Soldiers, they were very, very close friends at Fort Benning while we were all over in Vietnam.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.302
I want to talk about that now.

15:24.322 --> 15:35.897
I want to move on to your, you also served, when you were attached to the 3rd Brigade, you served under Colonel Hal Moore, who also became a general.

15:36.738 --> 15:49.253
And for those people who saw the movie or read the book, the book was called We Were Soldiers and Young Ones, and the movie We Were Soldiers that Mel Gibson, I believe, produced and starred in.

15:49.705 --> 15:55.397
You and I both agree it's probably the most accurate and the best movie involving Vietnam that's ever been made.

15:56.058 --> 15:58.263
I definitely believe that.

15:58.423 --> 15:59.445
You were there at that time.

15:59.485 --> 16:07.883
You weren't directly involved in the battle by Drang, but you were there about 10 miles away in your duty as a military police, and you served under Hal Moore.

16:08.437 --> 16:09.399
Talk about that time.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.382
Talk about what you remember about that time.

16:11.402 --> 16:18.433
And I also want you to talk about the movie also and the book and the effect that it had on you.

16:18.474 --> 16:26.667
And a little bit later, we're going to see, as a matter of fact, a picture of a letter that you received not too long ago from Hal Moore in response to a letter that you wrote.

16:27.148 --> 16:30.293
Talk about all aspects of what we're talking about here.

16:30.745 --> 16:44.197
Well, of course, the Pleiku campaign or the Battle of Idrang basically started towards the end of October and then went into November.

16:45.618 --> 16:54.627
And the first and second of the seventh cab, Lieutenant Colonel Moore at that time commanded the first of the seventh.

16:54.647 --> 17:00.752
And they were the ones that really stepped into that battle as the movie depicts.

17:00.732 --> 17:24.478
better individuals than I those that served they had a history versus fiction they had two of the Medal of Honor winners on that and plus two or three of the MCOs and they indicated that movie was 70 to 80 percent accurate and so from my standpoint what I saw

17:24.458 --> 17:37.356
When our unit came up to relieve the 3rd Brigade, which was only two battalions, and at that point, the second of the 7th Cav in the second part of that battle had really lost a lot of people.

17:38.217 --> 17:46.208
And I think there was over 350 men that were killed in those two battles.

17:48.291 --> 17:51.816
Colonel Moore's unit lost about 80.

17:54.277 --> 18:10.234
to see the equipment, the blood-stained equipment that was stacked up and the weapons was a sight that, it's just amazing.

18:10.774 --> 18:13.437
And what they went through during that time.

18:14.538 --> 18:21.145
And I can just assure you that as a military police unit, we handled

18:21.614 --> 18:29.407
those individuals that got in trouble with those units with a lot of respect and pride.

18:30.248 --> 18:33.573
And we did this with all the first Cavs.

18:34.294 --> 18:35.216
We took care of our own.

18:35.777 --> 18:40.384
And many times if they got in trouble, we just took them to their first sergeant and let them take care of it.

18:40.404 --> 18:42.528
But that was a major battle.

18:42.548 --> 18:44.010
And of course, right after that,

18:43.990 --> 18:49.226
We refitted a lot of the units that were in that battle.

18:50.269 --> 18:54.321
We brought in a whole new group of men came in that were

18:54.605 --> 18:56.848
had volunteered to go into the Army.

18:56.928 --> 18:57.929
They were a regular Army.

18:59.311 --> 19:03.797
They heard the call of the president of the country.

19:03.817 --> 19:08.984
And we got this new group of influx in December of 65 and January of 66.

19:10.146 --> 19:13.771
While a lot of the guys were leaving, about two-thirds of our company rotated.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.035
And so we had to train them up.

19:17.943 --> 19:24.752
Then we stepped into the battle, or the Operation White Wing Master, which was the longest operation of the war.

19:25.153 --> 19:26.715
It went for about 45 days.

19:26.915 --> 19:36.307
I want to go ahead and move on to some photographs that you supplied for us, some photographs from your time at Vietnam, and I want you to look at them and sort of show us what we're looking at.

19:36.327 --> 19:38.230
I think the first one up, as a matter of fact,

19:38.210 --> 19:40.634
That's your emblem.

19:40.654 --> 19:41.435
That's your patch.

19:41.575 --> 19:42.978
Talk a little bit about that.

19:43.338 --> 19:48.647
Well, that emblem is the first calf patch with a horse.

19:51.652 --> 19:53.535
You see that on many of the

19:53.515 --> 19:57.139
of our present veterans that are in Iraq.

19:58.260 --> 20:02.464
That unit is based at Fort Hood.

20:03.205 --> 20:06.808
It's a heavy tank unit now, or armor unit.

20:07.609 --> 20:13.094
And it's one that we wear with pride on our right shoulders.

20:14.816 --> 20:17.659
So that's the 545th, is that right?

20:17.679 --> 20:19.280
That is the patch for the entire division.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.422
For the entire division, okay.

20:21.442 --> 20:22.003
There you are.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.052
There's young Al Rantmire right there.

20:24.092 --> 20:24.933
Where was that taken?

20:24.953 --> 20:25.954
Talk about that.

20:25.974 --> 20:36.227
That was taken on the coast of Vietnam, about 20 miles from Quing An, going towards what's called Bong Song.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.352
We were in a brigade area.

20:40.372 --> 20:44.717
I'm carrying, I have an AK-47, which is a

20:44.950 --> 20:54.856
A weapon that I carried for a while due to only having a .45 caliber pistol, and so I was able to get one of those, and I carried that for quite a while.

20:55.237 --> 20:56.580
Okay, let's move on.

20:58.180 --> 20:58.841
You're on the left.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.823
What are we doing here?

21:01.023 --> 21:06.488
That's my platoon sergeant, who was a veteran of Korea.

21:07.489 --> 21:13.696
And I was blessed to have strong NCOs, non-commissioned officers, to serve with.

21:14.517 --> 21:19.281
And Sergeant Kernan just passed away a year and a half ago.

21:19.381 --> 21:21.203
He was living in Hillsboro, Texas.

21:22.164 --> 21:24.086
But he was actually from Georgia.

21:24.106 --> 21:27.850
And he always said,

21:27.830 --> 21:29.854
Sir, I'll take care of the men.

21:29.874 --> 21:32.819
You take care of the officers and the brigade.

21:33.481 --> 21:36.026
And when I need you, I'll call you.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.288
All right.

21:37.328 --> 21:38.851
We're playing with knives there.

21:38.871 --> 21:39.813
Yeah, it looks like we are.

21:40.795 --> 21:41.456
What's this, I think?

21:41.476 --> 21:42.738
Is that you on the left?

21:43.179 --> 21:44.141
That's me on the left.

21:44.922 --> 21:48.790
That's a Texas boy by the name of Lot who helped barbecue a calf.

21:49.251 --> 21:50.513
We had helped a...

21:50.864 --> 22:00.276
Army of the Republic, a Vietnam lieutenant that had a deserter, and he gave us a Jersey calf, and so we barbecued it.

22:01.117 --> 22:09.507
And we're up near LZ Pony above Bong Thong in the February 66th time frame.

22:09.527 --> 22:15.875
And we barbecued that for all of the men and everybody else that we barbecued a whole calf.

22:17.117 --> 22:17.857
All right.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.099
Let's go to the next picture.

22:19.079 --> 22:23.644
This is also during the Operation White Wing Masher.

22:23.664 --> 22:32.114
Those are a lot of the individuals that were moved out of their homes and we call them Viet Cong suspects.

22:33.756 --> 22:42.927
They were moved away so that they would not be involved in the firefights and for protection purposes.

22:42.947 --> 22:44.108
They were interrogated.

22:44.324 --> 22:50.251
by our military intelligence group, and we have them behind concertina wire.

22:50.972 --> 23:04.729
Most of those were released to the Army or Republic of Vietnam, and then, of course, then they returned either to their homes or they were sent to an area where they would not be involved in getting shot at again.

23:04.969 --> 23:05.270
Okay.

23:07.673 --> 23:09.214
This is up near Khantum.

23:09.235 --> 23:11.277
We're getting ready to fly into a...

23:11.577 --> 23:12.720
Special Forces Camp.

23:13.882 --> 23:15.065
That's me sitting in the middle.

23:16.107 --> 23:21.078
Just to my left is Sergeant Sanders.

23:22.561 --> 23:25.969
One of my, he and I have stayed in close contact.

23:26.069 --> 23:28.495
We usually talk at least once or twice a month.

23:29.497 --> 23:31.341
He lives in FIBA, Mississippi.

23:31.321 --> 23:36.331
and he's medically retired due to Agent Orange, and that's a group of my men.

23:36.351 --> 23:41.561
We're actually getting ready to back a jeep and a trailer into a caribou.

23:41.902 --> 23:44.287
Okay, let's move on.

23:44.307 --> 23:45.549
This is quite a unique picture.

23:45.729 --> 23:49.176
This is General Westmoreland and Colonel Moore, right?

23:49.196 --> 23:52.182
Yes, this is Colonel Hal Moore.

23:52.769 --> 23:59.996
July the 4th, 1966, he's receiving the Distinguished Service Cross from General Westmoreland.

24:00.016 --> 24:03.339
That's pretty special for something like that to happen.

24:03.359 --> 24:12.348
Of course, the unit, the division received the presidential unit citation for the Pleiku campaign, but General Westmoreland was there.

24:12.548 --> 24:19.114
We're in a special forces camp called Dong Trae, and we're near Tuiwa.

24:19.415 --> 24:30.551
above Quignon and here he is getting ready to turn over his brigade and be sent home.

24:32.234 --> 24:49.118
This is two of the H-13 bubble helicopters that were coming in to get diesel fuel and they hooked helicopter blades and

24:50.262 --> 24:59.006
It took the top off one helicopter and of course took the blades off both and it was right there where our unit, we were within about a hundred yards of it.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.032
All right, let's move on to the next picture.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.181
This is a letter that we referred to.

25:06.501 --> 25:12.568
It was written to you in January of this year from Hal Moore in response to a letter that you wrote to him.

25:13.309 --> 25:15.231
And I know this letter means a lot to you.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.753
He lives in Auburn, Alabama.

25:17.174 --> 25:28.787
If you can't read what it says, it says, first, thank you for your combat service in Vietnam as a fellow 1st Cav trooper and for the help that you and your men gave to me and my troopers in some very spooky places.

25:29.348 --> 25:34.073
And thank you for the photos of that sad occasion when I had to leave my great brigade

25:34.289 --> 25:42.640
at Dong Tray on 4 July, 66, with respect to a fellow First Cav combat veteran, signed Hal Moore, and that was written to you.

25:42.740 --> 25:44.903
So I know that letter means a lot to you.

25:44.923 --> 25:45.544
Yes, it does.

25:46.766 --> 25:49.269
He was a brilliant tactician.

25:51.152 --> 25:58.221
They called him the killer of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong.

25:58.370 --> 25:59.612
He was a West Point graduate.

26:00.773 --> 26:07.723
Interesting thing is that he had an effect upon this gentleman in the picture here.

26:07.944 --> 26:08.564
Right.

26:08.584 --> 26:11.509
And talk about that picture.

26:12.850 --> 26:18.298
This is four-star General Norman Schwarzkopf, retired.

26:18.318 --> 26:21.002
And our company had...

26:20.982 --> 26:29.033
a special reception for him for the veterans before he spoke to us in our international leadership conference.

26:29.173 --> 26:29.454
Right.

26:30.095 --> 26:38.566
And I was wearing my first calf, Stetson, and as soon as he saw it, he came over and we started talking.

26:38.586 --> 26:44.915
It turns out that he knew, obviously, both of the two individuals that I served with, those two colonels.

26:45.496 --> 26:50.803
But Hal Moore was very special to him because in 1956, Hal Moore recommended

26:51.070 --> 26:54.896
that instead of going engineering, he would go infantry.

26:54.996 --> 26:58.601
And of course, he said, here I am, a retired four-star general.

26:59.182 --> 26:59.542
Indeed.

27:00.544 --> 27:02.887
We're out of time, believe it or not.

27:02.907 --> 27:05.931
But I want to thank you for your service and thank you for being with us today.

27:05.951 --> 27:13.102
There's a whole lot more to talk about, the reunions that you have of the 545th and the great service that you give to our community now.

27:13.122 --> 27:15.545
But we're out of time and I want to thank you for our service.

27:15.565 --> 27:16.707
Thank you for having us.

27:16.687 --> 27:22.555
The Vietnam War is part of our history that will be debated as long as there are historians to debate it.

27:22.575 --> 27:31.388
But one thing can't be debated is the bravery and dedication of the young men and women who went there, those who returned and those 58,000 Americans who did not.

27:31.408 --> 27:34.772
We thank Al Rampmeier for his service as we do all veterans.

27:34.792 --> 27:35.674
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:35.734 --> 27:38.037
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
