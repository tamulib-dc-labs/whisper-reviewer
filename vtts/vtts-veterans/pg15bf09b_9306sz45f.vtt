00:03.608 --> 00:13.787
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin Family Community Bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:14.248 --> 00:24.587
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:32.515 --> 00:56.413
Thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:56.832 --> 00:59.516
He says he's from Evansville, Indiana originally.

00:59.536 --> 01:05.105
He notes he was actually born in Danville, Illinois because that's where the closest hospital was.

01:05.706 --> 01:09.813
He played baseball and football in high school and he was pretty good at it.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.015
He lettered for three years.

01:11.035 --> 01:12.838
He was president of the student council.

01:13.098 --> 01:19.228
He married his high school sweetheart, Jay, and they are still together today after 45 glorious years.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.970
He's a veteran of the Vietnam War.

01:21.090 --> 01:26.976
He flew 213 total combat missions, 113 as a forward air controller.

01:27.336 --> 01:29.338
We'll let him tell you about that.

01:29.358 --> 01:31.760
Veterans of the Valley welcomes former U.S.

01:31.780 --> 01:34.743
Air Force Captain Jerry Congleton to today's show.

01:34.983 --> 01:36.004
Jerry, thanks for being here.

01:36.325 --> 01:37.085
Thank you for having me.

01:38.367 --> 01:39.388
Let's pick it up right.

01:39.408 --> 01:42.471
Basically, you got commissioned right out of school.

01:42.531 --> 01:45.013
Pick it up from there and tell us what happened.

01:45.263 --> 01:48.828
I got an industrial engineering degree from University of Evansville in 1967.

01:50.050 --> 01:55.397
And the day I graduated, I was commissioned in the Air Force out of ROTC.

01:55.417 --> 01:56.438
I was a volunteer.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.242
I was married with two children.

01:59.262 --> 02:03.989
There was no way that I would have been drafted with two children.

02:04.009 --> 02:08.655
But my grandfather had served in World War I, my father in World War II.

02:09.007 --> 02:14.974
and I thought it was my turn, and I believed in the mission for Vietnam and fighting communism.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.917
So you just felt it was your turn and your duty to go?

02:16.937 --> 02:17.417
Absolutely.

02:18.298 --> 02:19.940
Okay.

02:20.281 --> 02:22.784
Go ahead and tell us, where did you end up starting out at?

02:23.024 --> 02:26.168
Well, they sent me to Vance Air Force Base.

02:26.448 --> 02:35.099
We thought we'd see the world, and they sent us to Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma, which is really not seeing the world much from there.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.423
It's like God took a fly swatter and smacked the earth

02:39.095 --> 02:41.718
and everything was a section line.

02:41.738 --> 02:46.544
And so we used to watch the tornadoes go by when we weren't flying.

02:47.465 --> 03:06.688
After Enid, Oklahoma, graduated from pilot training in 1968 in May, we went to, I was selected then for F4s and went to training in Davis-Monthan for radar training.

03:07.141 --> 03:20.543
After that, we went to sea survival school where they practiced dropping us out of an LST and floating down to the water and sitting in a raft for an hour to give us that experience.

03:22.225 --> 03:24.609
All I know for sure is that I didn't want to eject.

03:25.470 --> 03:30.118
And if I was going to eject, I would prefer to do that over water as opposed to over land.

03:31.721 --> 03:33.283
We went then to...

03:33.466 --> 03:44.559
to a Vietnam POW training camp where they would simulate the tactics that the Vietnamese would use on you if you had been captured.

03:46.481 --> 03:48.463
That was quite an experience in itself.

03:51.286 --> 03:55.671
The basic thing that I learned out of that was that I did not want to be captured.

03:56.412 --> 03:57.914
The bottom line is you don't want to be captured.

03:57.934 --> 03:59.035
I do not want to be captured.

03:59.588 --> 04:09.141
because the mind games that they could play with you in just 72 hours were unbelievable to me, and I knew that that, again, was not one of the things that I wanted to do.

04:09.161 --> 04:15.670
So before I'd ever check out of an F4, it was going to be absolutely last resort because of the situation.

04:17.792 --> 04:28.667
They also offered me at that time an opportunity to go to Winter Survival, and I didn't think that really made any sense for me to go Winter Survival, but they gave us an alternative, which was to learn

04:29.238 --> 04:37.327
a special code that in case we did get shot down, we could write messages within our messages if the Red Cross was allowed to give any letters to our family.

04:38.128 --> 04:45.797
So I elected to do that, which I don't remember how to do anymore anyway, so it really wouldn't have been much value.

04:48.079 --> 04:52.945
Following that, I went to the Philippines and went through jungle survival.

04:54.987 --> 04:55.988
I remember

04:56.356 --> 05:25.502
you're as a young person you know i'll be 25 years old they were telling us as we got off the airplane there and gave us a briefing about uh being at clark air force base and these are all the places that you shouldn't go because it would be dangerous and we were writing them down as fast as we possibly could so that we could go we thanked them then for telling us all about these places because

05:26.022 --> 05:33.837
When you're in that mode of going to war and you don't really know what it's all about, you're trying to live life to its fullest.

05:34.318 --> 05:34.759
Right.

05:34.779 --> 05:37.765
And so you don't want to leave anything out.

05:37.885 --> 05:40.290
You pretty much feel indestructible at that point, more or less.

05:40.370 --> 05:40.851
Exactly.

05:41.151 --> 05:46.782
Or you do feel destructible and you want to make sure you live life before you lose your life, possibly.

05:48.517 --> 05:54.444
We went to jungle survival, and in the jungle survival training, that was an interesting process in itself.

05:54.525 --> 05:58.590
The Negrito natives, there's 5,000 of them.

05:58.610 --> 05:59.331
They're pygmies.

05:59.951 --> 06:09.083
They live up in the mountains in the northern Philippines, still use blowguns, still use bow and arrow.

06:11.286 --> 06:17.173
The tallest male would be about the size of my 12-year-old son.

06:18.048 --> 06:20.170
They have two things in their organization.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.252
They have a king and they have an executioner.

06:22.272 --> 06:32.282
So it's an interesting organization for running the 5,000 agreed old natives there, loincloths, the whole bit.

06:32.302 --> 06:44.494
Again, having to camp out in the jungle at night using your tent and how you could get up off the ground and that the fact that the jungle comes alive at night

06:44.744 --> 06:51.538
and you have snakes and rats and all kinds of animals scurrying along the ground and in the trees, et cetera.

06:52.941 --> 06:57.029
Again, it reinforced to me another reason for not ejecting.

06:58.212 --> 07:06.128
That was the biggest thing I learned out of sea survival, POW training camp, jungle survival was,

07:06.766 --> 07:09.349
I was going to stay with the airplane unless it was a last resort.

07:09.369 --> 07:13.695
They were going to make it bad enough for you where you're going to stay with that aircraft and get it back or someplace a lot safer.

07:14.055 --> 07:15.457
Exactly.

07:15.477 --> 07:23.607
And I think that that's part of the training that they want you to have is don't get out of the airplane unless it's an absolute necessity.

07:23.627 --> 07:24.248
Right.

07:24.268 --> 07:30.315
And from there, I went to getting ready to get on a C-130 and go over to Da Nang.

07:30.375 --> 07:35.001
And they pulled me out of my group of fellow pilots and said,

07:35.943 --> 07:38.250
We want you to go to Uban, Thailand.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.456
I didn't even know where Uban, Thailand was.

07:40.576 --> 07:45.430
But in the military, when they tell you to do something, you just get on another airplane and you go.

07:46.473 --> 07:50.957
And so for the viewers, Uban is at what northeast part of Thailand, upper part of Thailand?

07:50.977 --> 08:00.065
It's the central north central on the Mekong River, not very far from the Mekong River, probably only about 22 miles away.

08:00.205 --> 08:04.789
It sits in the middle part of Laos as the eastern border.

08:06.010 --> 08:15.619
And so most of the war I did fight was in Laos, which was a neutral country and nobody knew we were fighting there.

08:16.072 --> 08:19.377
But there was a hell of a war that went on in Laos.

08:19.397 --> 08:26.106
Because that's where the trucks and the supplies came down from North Vietnam.

08:26.126 --> 08:30.472
They were pretty much blocked at the DMZ from North and South Vietnam.

08:30.492 --> 08:38.383
So they would go in through Laos and the Magia Pass and Bankerai Pass and then down through hundreds and hundreds of trails.

08:39.022 --> 09:00.962
into south vietnam and cambodia and then from cambodia into south vietnam so they would just do kind of a swing in to get back into exactly the navy had them blocked on the gulf side on the ocean side and so our job was to take them out on the uh on the um lao laotian side right and so uh

09:01.904 --> 09:13.578
Got there, went into the 25th Tech Fighter Squadron, and our primary mission there was to drop electronic trees during the daytime.

09:13.618 --> 09:23.389
An electronic tree was just a camouflage like a rocket that you would drop off your airplane and it would go down and stick in the ground and bury itself except for the antenna.

09:24.162 --> 09:26.284
next to a known trail.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.365
How big was this thing?

09:27.445 --> 09:28.346
Like a yardstick or?

09:28.567 --> 09:29.608
Yes, about a yardstick.

09:29.768 --> 09:30.088
Okay.

09:30.108 --> 09:31.930
That's a good guess.

09:32.070 --> 09:36.155
And the thing would stick in the ground, and they're also booby traps.

09:36.175 --> 09:41.220
So if they did want to go mess with it, it probably wasn't a good idea on their part.

09:42.501 --> 09:47.807
But we'd put that like 100 meters or less off of the trail.

09:48.948 --> 09:53.713
And then at night, at Nkamp Phnom NKP,

09:54.318 --> 10:18.975
They had a big theater set up with all the trails through Laos coming out of Mageea Pass and Bancari Pass, and they'd have them up there, and if a trail was active because of the sensor of either heat or vibration of the truck going next to the road or voices or whatever, it would let you know that that trail was active.

10:20.204 --> 10:26.112
you were dropping these weapons off of a Loran system that was plus or minus, I think it was 65 feet.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.355
So it was really very accurate.

10:29.316 --> 10:43.535
And so you would then offset back onto the trail and you would go back at night, low level and drop your weapons along the trail, hoping to hit a truck so that you get something lit up.

10:43.575 --> 10:48.301
So then they could come in with flares and take it out in a big time way.

10:49.323 --> 10:49.603
So,

10:50.579 --> 11:20.434
whole war over there from the 25th squadron standpoint and from our standpoint was fighting with one hand tied behind your back right and it was very frustrating from that standpoint because there would be 300 trucks lined up on the north vietnamese side of the border waiting to come across at night we couldn't touch them during the daytime when they come across the border at night then we could

11:20.819 --> 11:21.400
have at them.

11:23.042 --> 11:36.422
And that's really not giving your military an opportunity to do what they could do, which was to make the enemy not have the ability to fight.

11:36.442 --> 11:46.337
When you have a president and the defense McNamara, if you have Johnson and McNamara and President Johnson choosing targets in his bedroom at night,

11:46.975 --> 11:57.427
as opposed to your generals or colonels or lieutenant colonels or majors or whoever, you know that you don't have much of a chance to fight the war the way you need to fight the war to win.

11:59.230 --> 12:08.440
But we had some arrogance about us, and the arrogance was, well, even with one hand tied behind our back, we could still beat you.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.825
And so we would send C-130s out at night with guns.

12:11.845 --> 12:14.788
We'd have our 25th squadron there dropping

12:15.190 --> 12:17.793
weapons along the trails.

12:17.813 --> 12:24.982
We'd have the night owls dropping flares at Mageea Pass and Bankerai Pass to catch trucks on the road under the flares.

12:26.564 --> 12:34.553
Even with all that, the interdiction was somewhat successful, but not successful enough to win the war.

12:35.594 --> 12:40.080
And that was a very frustrating thing about that.

12:40.901 --> 12:44.505
Sometimes we would turn off our responder

12:45.110 --> 12:52.139
and go low level just into North Vietnam, not legally, according to the rules, but just to see how many trucks they were.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.384
And that's the reason why I can verify that there were 300 trucks.

12:55.624 --> 12:56.305
We counted them.

12:57.527 --> 12:57.747
Right.

12:58.849 --> 13:01.452
So that was... You could see them, you just couldn't touch them.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.214
Couldn't touch them.

13:03.234 --> 13:06.919
Couldn't blow up their bridges, couldn't blow up their dams, flood the country.

13:07.660 --> 13:11.826
So it was a very politicized, political type of war.

13:12.228 --> 13:22.444
trying to fight the war in the media instead of trying to fight the war the way they fought the war in World War II or World War I, which was to win the war.

13:22.464 --> 13:24.467
And that was frustrating.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.892
It was still a war against communism.

13:28.012 --> 13:35.364
People forget that we were fighting communists, that we end up stopping communism in Southeast Asia.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.108
There was not any more after Vietnam.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.632
No more countries were taken over by communism.

13:41.607 --> 13:44.271
Um, we lost 58,000 soldiers.

13:44.692 --> 13:47.216
They lost 2 million people.

13:47.236 --> 13:49.098
They lost 20% of their population.

13:49.739 --> 13:53.746
So that to me is, yeah, we're the losers.

13:54.747 --> 13:56.310
In my view, we did not lose.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.214
We stopped communism and that's what we were supposed to do.

13:59.775 --> 14:01.357
And that's the reason I was there.

14:01.377 --> 14:08.408
People forget that we had a Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties that, uh,

14:08.506 --> 14:16.916
We stopped communism from coming to Cuba from the standpoint of having missiles there only 90 miles from our shore.

14:16.936 --> 14:18.659
We stopped Che Guevara in Africa.

14:19.139 --> 14:21.302
We stopped Che Guevara in South America.

14:22.323 --> 14:25.227
So to me, it was all about fighting communism.

14:25.247 --> 14:31.695
And also, the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong are terrorists, in my view.

14:31.715 --> 14:37.602
They were the worst terrorists, much worse than what you see today in Iraq and Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda.

14:38.122 --> 14:44.132
I was not, there was no doubt in my mind who the enemy was and that they were the worst.

14:44.774 --> 14:47.138
Much like the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia.

14:47.398 --> 14:47.879
Absolutely.

14:49.302 --> 14:54.831
What they did to their people is unbelievable and it gets no press whatsoever.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.516
And that was frustrating.

14:57.536 --> 15:00.501
You spoke, you flew the F-4s, was that the D or E model?

15:00.582 --> 15:02.946
I flew the C's, D's, and E's.

15:03.266 --> 15:06.311
But in Vietnam, it was primarily D's.

15:06.331 --> 15:07.412
The D model?

15:07.593 --> 15:13.542
And the D had the external gun and had rocket pods or weapons.

15:13.582 --> 15:16.106
It could carry 2,200, 500-pound bombs.

15:16.126 --> 15:17.368
It could carry missiles.

15:17.388 --> 15:19.391
So it had a multiple role.

15:19.491 --> 15:22.115
It had the bombing role.

15:22.435 --> 15:25.560
It had air-to-air role, and it had air-to-ground role.

15:25.979 --> 15:28.163
It was pretty much the workhorse of the war at that time.

15:28.183 --> 15:31.469
It was, and it was the best plane that we had at that particular time.

15:32.451 --> 15:43.853
58,000 pounds, it was a huge plane, lots of power, put out a lot of black smoke, made a lot of noise, but it was the best we had, and it served us well.

15:44.002 --> 16:09.148
we've got some pictures let's go to those and you can maybe tell us a little bit about the f4 because i think we've got a few shots of you standing with i guess that would be your your bird that you're with actually this is the t-38 from pilot training this is the last jet i flew in pilot training they still use those today don't they still use them today and my grandkids are amazed that they still have an airplane that

16:09.533 --> 16:12.657
They're using the day that I flew those years ago.

16:13.718 --> 16:15.961
They expect to be a prop plan or something with two wings.

16:15.981 --> 16:17.323
Exactly, yeah.

16:17.343 --> 16:22.930
And they're actually amazed that we actually had colored pictures, colored photos in those days.

16:23.751 --> 16:32.583
That's a picture of me standing in my hut at the VOQ or BOQ for our officers' quarters.

16:34.225 --> 16:39.051
Picture of elephants in the background that had a lot of kind of tapestry in...

16:39.385 --> 16:46.055
Thailand and you see from that picture I'm a slim young man as compared to today.

16:47.997 --> 17:07.165
It reminds me of a story that my wife did with me and I got all excited about Iraq and Afghanistan and I thought that I could still do it and I started driving faster and taking corners faster and my wife told me, I told her this rush I was getting and

17:07.533 --> 17:11.102
my wife has a way of humbling me and bringing me back to earth.

17:11.122 --> 17:20.865
And she said, why don't you go in the closet and put your flight suit on if you can still get it on, which I couldn't, and run around the backyard and I'll shoot at you with a pistol.

17:22.028 --> 17:23.331
So it kind of let me know that

17:23.480 --> 17:28.225
my day had come and gone, and so that's the way that turned out.

17:28.425 --> 17:30.087
Okay, okay.

17:30.127 --> 17:31.028
What's this picture of?

17:31.408 --> 17:38.956
That's a picture of me standing next to the F4, and the big intake behind, that's the ladder that you climb up into the F4.

17:39.816 --> 17:46.563
That's with all my gear on, my survival kit, my weapon, 38, your emergency radios.

17:46.583 --> 17:47.704
You usually have two of those.

17:48.245 --> 17:53.250
You usually had some water bottles, your survival knives,

17:53.602 --> 17:57.006
the ability to take care of yourself if you do get on the ground.

17:57.927 --> 17:58.047
Right.

17:58.067 --> 18:09.480
And so that's a picture of the group of forward air controllers called the Wolf FACS, FACS standing for forward air controller.

18:10.682 --> 18:21.113
I was in the Wolf Pack, which is the 8th Attack Fighter Wing, and these are seven crews that served as the Wolf FACS.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.495
We were the FACS.

18:22.998 --> 18:28.927
forward air controllers for the 8th Tech Fighter Wing or anybody that was sent into Central Laos.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.231
We controlled Central Laos.

18:31.492 --> 18:37.822
Nothing was put in bomb-wise into Central Laos during the day that we did not direct.

18:37.862 --> 18:38.683
That you guys didn't know about.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.065
We directed it.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.528
We marked the target.

18:42.689 --> 18:47.177
Our airplane, as you can see there, it has missiles on it.

18:47.798 --> 18:50.001
It has the center-mounted gun.

18:50.605 --> 19:16.461
it has a rocket pod and the rocket pod was there to shoot individual rockets with a white smoke because they make a white smoke and you would shoot that at the target that would mark the target for the four airplanes that were above you at 10 12 000 feet once they see the target then they would roll in we would stay around 1200 1500 feet to 2500 feet so as not to get

19:17.791 --> 19:26.765
into gunfire from AK-47s above that, but below what 23 millimeter and 37 millimeter guns could do.

19:27.346 --> 19:30.531
That was kind of our, that was our hopefully safe zone.

19:30.552 --> 19:30.852
Okay.

19:30.912 --> 19:31.733
As safe as it could get.

19:31.914 --> 19:33.156
Exactly.

19:33.176 --> 19:40.407
And we would stay in that area around the target and all through Central Laos.

19:40.427 --> 19:43.933
And you memorize Central Laos like the back of your hand.

19:44.943 --> 19:46.245
I'm at the peanut karst.

19:46.505 --> 19:47.807
I'm at the alligator head.

19:48.508 --> 19:49.609
Everything had a name.

19:50.290 --> 19:57.639
If you could see a piece of ground, you knew where you were and you know that when you went down, you could turn left or right and not hit a karst.

19:58.420 --> 20:06.931
You just, you became so familiar with it because you spent three and a half hours a day on your mission.

20:08.012 --> 20:13.359
That seven crews flew three to four missions a day.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.140
One would be off.

20:14.693 --> 20:18.800
administratively or a rest and recuperation or whatever.

20:18.820 --> 20:26.232
So my missions in the 25th squadron were that ranged from 40 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes.

20:26.252 --> 20:40.195
My missions with a forward air controller were three and a half hours with four or five refuelings because we're burning up a lot of fuel when we're down low to the ground, have it at 500 knots, moving back and forth, jinking the airplane.

20:40.512 --> 20:45.239
So you burn up a lot of fuel and that's that three, three to six G's.

20:45.259 --> 20:52.611
And like if my trunk weighs a hundred pounds, six G's means that when I was pulled six G's, my trunk weighed 600 pounds.

20:52.631 --> 20:55.295
That's the reason my back got into a heavy load.

20:55.315 --> 20:57.639
That's a heavy load more than my back wanted.

20:59.121 --> 20:59.241
Right.

20:59.261 --> 21:01.565
Uh, this is a picture of the champagne flight.

21:02.126 --> 21:04.970
Uh, my last mission, 213 combat missions.

21:06.112 --> 21:08.916
Um, and, uh, also this is, uh,

21:09.470 --> 21:11.192
This is actually the colonel's girlfriend.

21:11.232 --> 21:11.933
Give me a kiss.

21:11.973 --> 21:12.614
He's sitting there.

21:12.634 --> 21:14.256
He's standing there on the left hand side.

21:14.336 --> 21:15.498
And Jay knew all about this.

21:15.518 --> 21:16.559
Jay knew all about this.

21:16.639 --> 21:21.505
And she was she would be happy with this from the standpoint that she knew I was coming home.

21:21.525 --> 21:22.446
Right.

21:22.466 --> 21:30.837
And so in 10 and a half months, I flew this 213 missions, 113 of those with as a forward air controller.

21:31.643 --> 21:35.268
I got over 500 hours of combat time.

21:35.429 --> 21:37.071
Tell us what each of these medals are.

21:37.492 --> 21:42.739
Well, the blue and white one there is the Distinguished Flying Cross.

21:43.460 --> 21:49.810
And the one on the right is the Vietnam medal.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.734
That's the one with the yellow with the three red stripes.

21:53.475 --> 21:57.381
And the one with the blue and the orange, that is the...

21:57.715 --> 22:01.539
air metal, and that's the one that I have 17 air metals.

22:01.579 --> 22:03.941
We call them 16 oak leaf clusters, the air metals.

22:05.742 --> 22:18.194
Mostly, people would get an air metal for flying 25 missions, but we were getting them for every seven missions because of the length of our mission and the high visibility.

22:19.816 --> 22:24.520
We lost an airplane out of those seven crews.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.642
We lost an airplane every month.

22:27.449 --> 22:29.612
we lost a crew every other month.

22:30.354 --> 22:35.261
And so it had a lot more visibility in terms of risk.

22:35.281 --> 22:44.616
And the hardest phone call I ever had to make was when I came back from R&R back in the States and told my wife that I was joining WFAC.

22:45.657 --> 22:55.633
After I told her how crazy they were in the mission and I would never do that, the day I got back they asked me to join and I couldn't refuse.

22:56.423 --> 23:07.648
I just don't think I could ever live with myself from the standpoint of if I let someone else take that job when they wanted me and they thought I was one of the better ones.

23:08.472 --> 23:13.217
If something happened to that individual, I don't think I could have lived with myself, so I had to step up.

23:13.237 --> 23:13.357
Right.

23:13.377 --> 23:18.222
Now, this picture here, I believe, you've left Nam now, and this is?

23:18.843 --> 23:23.368
This is in our squadron in Bitburg, Germany.

23:23.388 --> 23:25.230
I was in Germany for three and a half years.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.093
I'm an aircraft commander.

23:28.173 --> 23:31.376
That is Mike Smith, a fellow fighter pilot.

23:31.736 --> 23:38.023
He served two tours in Vietnam, one in the Goonie Bird and then the other as an F-4 pilot.

23:38.830 --> 23:44.756
And we're going to Cambrai, France for the NATO Tiger meet.

23:44.776 --> 23:51.023
All the squadrons, all the Tiger squadrons in NATO for the fighter squadrons get together once a year.

23:51.744 --> 23:58.872
This is a meet in Cambrai, France, where Mike and I were representing the United States.

23:59.032 --> 24:00.373
This is a lady.

24:00.393 --> 24:01.655
Is that the plane right there that you put?

24:01.675 --> 24:02.596
Yes, that's the F-4.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.660
And you can see it's a pretty...

24:07.028 --> 24:11.955
Pretty big airplane and quite a workhorse, as you said.

24:12.756 --> 24:20.027
So the NATO Tigers get together and it is a happening.

24:21.149 --> 24:28.159
All the fighter pilots trying to outdo the other fighter pilots, trying to outfly them and outdrink them and whatever.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.244
And so it's a wild session.

24:31.264 --> 24:32.466
They hold their own little top gun.

24:32.666 --> 24:33.307
Exactly.

24:34.489 --> 24:36.732
And we've got to talk about this picture.

24:37.268 --> 24:41.875
This is my wife when we were on arrest and recuperation in Hawaii.

24:43.057 --> 24:45.901
You can tell she was my little blonde hippie at that time.

24:46.863 --> 24:59.783
And 45 years we've been together with three children and six grandchildren, the seventh on the way and two step-grandchildren.

25:00.455 --> 25:05.601
And she had me laughing when I met her when she was 15, and she still has me laughing today.

25:05.961 --> 25:06.482
That's great.

25:06.502 --> 25:07.763
You can't get any better than that.

25:07.783 --> 25:08.003
Yes, sir.

25:09.305 --> 25:13.489
What was the difference between flying, obviously, combat in Vietnam?

25:13.509 --> 25:14.671
And we just have a couple of minutes left.

25:14.891 --> 25:15.952
But then you went to Germany.

25:16.433 --> 25:24.201
So it had to be a big, as far as a psychological thing, of going from that kind of environment to the flying in Germany for the European...

25:24.822 --> 25:42.039
When I first arrived there, I reported to duty in my camouflage flight suit and my jungle flight boots and the major personnel officer there told me that I needed to get into a green bag because I might scare the population.

25:43.440 --> 25:50.307
It was very difficult for me to be fighting communism in Vietnam and then go to Italy and be trained

25:50.843 --> 25:56.832
And yet there'd be, Communists was a major party in Italy, and you see the hammer and sickle on banners.

25:57.693 --> 26:01.318
And I'm very fortunate I didn't get in trouble making that transition.

26:02.039 --> 26:04.663
A little bit of luck, I stayed out of trouble.

26:05.444 --> 26:06.566
All right, good.

26:06.986 --> 26:07.467
Anything else?

26:07.487 --> 26:10.111
We've just got maybe about one minute left.

26:10.571 --> 26:15.799
I just might want to describe one mission to you from the standpoint that would give you an idea of what we did.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.264
We had the...

26:19.784 --> 26:21.166
37 millimeter sight.

26:21.806 --> 26:24.389
It had five positions, brand new picture.

26:24.690 --> 26:28.574
Not often did you get a brand new picture because the jungle grew very quickly.

26:30.016 --> 26:35.603
We rolled in on it, put our mark in, asked the lead if they had it.

26:36.043 --> 26:37.365
No response, no response.

26:38.586 --> 26:44.053
And then he asked us, and when we went down, they were shooting above and below the wings with tracers.

26:44.213 --> 26:45.775
And I just, you know, I,

26:46.177 --> 26:50.782
During the daytime, that was very unusual that you had them above and below the wings on both sides of the airplane.

26:51.784 --> 26:54.186
So that gave me a pretty good pucker factor.

26:54.367 --> 26:56.149
And then second, we went down.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.272
He asked us to go down again because the navigator dropped the picture.

27:00.133 --> 27:07.362
Anyway, went back down again, same thing, dropped the weapon, 300 yards, all clean and gone.

27:07.382 --> 27:10.025
And that's basically what you got your distinguished flying crossbow, correct?

27:10.065 --> 27:11.267
That's correct.

27:11.307 --> 27:12.648
Jerry, we're out of time.

27:12.668 --> 27:15.812
Thank you very much for being here today, and thank you for sharing your story with us.

27:15.995 --> 27:25.364
And thank you, Kyle, and thanks, Tom, and thanks for this program, KMU, because this is something that didn't happen to me 37 years ago.

27:25.384 --> 27:27.587
To get a chance to do this today is wonderful.

27:27.847 --> 27:28.728
And it's long overdue.

27:29.629 --> 27:36.175
You know, he's as strong as his convictions today as he was back in 1967 when he volunteered to go to Vietnam.

27:36.736 --> 27:38.518
He was the consummate Air Force pilot.

27:38.618 --> 27:40.820
He knew his job, and he did it very well.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.985
So well, in fact, he was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross and 17 Air Medals, as you heard.

27:45.965 --> 27:50.811
Veterans of the Valley salutes Jerry Congleton and all veterans of our armed forces.

27:50.831 --> 28:00.822
If you happen to see an individual in uniform around town, take just a minute to say thank you for what they do and the commitment they have made of their own free will to serve this country.

28:01.383 --> 28:05.628
For the entire KMUHD crew and Tom Turbyville, I'm Kyle Netterville.

28:05.868 --> 28:15.499
So long for now until the next installment of Veterans of the Valley.

28:20.153 --> 28:20.995
.

28:21.015 --> 28:38.466
.
