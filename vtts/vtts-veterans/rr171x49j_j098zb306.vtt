00:14.000 --> 00:30.000
[Music.]

00:34.113 --> 00:36.714
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.734 --> 00:37.716
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:38.692 --> 00:45.715
One common thread that runs through all veterans is pride in their service and even more pride to serve along other brave soldiers or sailors.

00:46.201 --> 00:54.895
They come no prouder than Captain David P. Marion, military advisor, serving in the jungles of Vietnam during the hottest time of that war, 1968 and 1969.

00:56.157 --> 01:02.267
Aggie Class of 65 and proud bass drummer of the Fighting Texas Aggie Band, David Marion was an Army officer.

01:02.287 --> 01:10.521
But as you will hear, perhaps his most memorable service was that alongside Navy Swift boats, alongside sailors who saved his life.

01:10.501 --> 01:13.665
Captain Marion, it's a pleasure to have you here on Veterans of the Valley.

01:14.526 --> 01:17.791
We've got so much to get to in your career, your military career.

01:17.891 --> 01:21.215
You come to Texas A&M in 1961, kind of a rude awakening.

01:21.756 --> 01:27.264
You arrived from Spur, Texas to Texas A&M, and there's a hurricane that just hit the coast named Carla.

01:27.404 --> 01:27.884
That's right.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.907
You didn't like the weather very much when you got here, right?

01:30.047 --> 01:32.010
I never saw so much water in my life, Tom.

01:32.050 --> 01:37.217
We came out of the drought of the 50s out there and the red rolling plains and the cow-calf country, and

01:37.619 --> 01:45.072
hit that headwind about Abilene, and boy, it started getting wet about Temple, and by the time we got here, like a drowned rat, you couldn't see.

01:47.076 --> 01:54.549
Enter Texas A&M in 1961, and you go through, you were in the Fighting Texas Accu Band as a bass drummer.

01:54.569 --> 01:59.678
I know that was something you were very proud of, and still proud to be a member of the band, actually, as an alumni, right?

01:59.978 --> 02:09.899
We are a part of the Texas Aggie Band Association, and when the old man band forms up out there, I still strap on the bass drum and go.

02:09.959 --> 02:16.232
We know that the spirit of Aggieland, this heartbeat there is from the drum.

02:16.651 --> 02:24.083
The pulse of the spirit of Aggieland, of course, is the fighting Texas Aggie band, but that bass drum is where the heartbeat comes from.

02:24.163 --> 02:24.684
Indeed it is.

02:24.704 --> 02:25.706
Something you and I have in common.

02:25.726 --> 02:27.889
I played the bass drum in my high school military band.

02:27.909 --> 02:28.771
That's what I understood.

02:29.372 --> 02:29.692
Indeed.

02:30.894 --> 02:40.650
You finished A&M in January of 1966, but you got a little gap there because the Army doesn't want you until May of 66, so you need to find some employment, and you were sort of at the right time at the right place.

02:40.630 --> 02:41.972
There, talk about that.

02:42.052 --> 02:42.612
That's right.

02:43.253 --> 02:43.854
Dr. A.B.

02:43.874 --> 02:48.379
Wooten told me that A&M just wasn't quite proud of me yet, Mr. Marion.

02:48.419 --> 02:59.493
In August, when I was trying to get out of here, that I hadn't taken his particular course, which was AgEco 422, which is land economics, the appraisal of real estate.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.938
It's a course that I use probably as much as anything except for farm and ranch management.

03:04.289 --> 03:06.593
in my later career with the U.S.

03:06.613 --> 03:08.156
Department of Agriculture.

03:08.176 --> 03:17.872
But because of that delay, I didn't get out in 65, and that caused me to have a later entry date into Fort Benning, Georgia.

03:18.533 --> 03:27.208
And all of the classes ahead of me, our class went to the 198th or 199th Light Infantry Brigade,

03:27.577 --> 03:34.126
straight over to Fort Polk and then over to what I call the live fire exercise in Southeast Asia.

03:34.286 --> 03:35.708
My class was split.

03:35.768 --> 03:47.965
A third went to Korea and the rest of us went to Germany, which was the first replacements that had arrived in Germany after they started drawing down sergeants and captains and

03:47.945 --> 03:52.810
They were all headed to Southeast Asia back in 66, 65.

03:53.451 --> 03:57.516
Before you went to Vietnam, you were stationed in Munich, Bavaria, Germany.

03:57.536 --> 03:59.037
Talk about your service there.

03:59.218 --> 04:04.744
Yes, I completed basic officer school at Bragg, excuse me, at Fort Benning.

04:04.764 --> 04:06.826
Benning School for Boys, we call it.

04:06.846 --> 04:11.151
Went through airborne jump school there in June and July, which wasn't real smart.

04:11.654 --> 04:21.681
I thought I might get into an airborne brigade over there with the 8th Division, but wound up in the 24th Mech Infantry Division down at Munich, Bavaria, Germany.

04:21.998 --> 04:40.120
That's an interesting part of our family history because my daddy in 1942, right after the Pearl Harbor event, was shipped out and joined the 24th Infantry Division Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in the 13th Flying Jackass Field Artillery.

04:40.140 --> 04:46.588
So he was in the 24th Division and then I wind up over there in what's called the Victory Division.

04:46.608 --> 04:49.812
I served as a platoon leader for about six months.

04:49.792 --> 04:56.946
And then as people began to make captain, they were shortly on orders and they were out of there, heading for Vietnam.

04:57.246 --> 05:04.680
And my company commander, Lieutenant Police, he got orders right after he got his railroad tracks.

05:05.342 --> 05:09.690
And so as a second lieutenant shaved tail with about six months on the

05:10.109 --> 05:27.730
Battalion, I became company commander of A Company, 2nd of the 21st Infantry, with some platoon sergeants, some E-6s, and one Sergeant First Class that was my actual platoon sergeant when I led 3rd platoon.

05:28.330 --> 05:34.578
And I have to give Sergeant Hippenstiel a lot of credit for my career, because he was a trooper, he was a soldier.

05:34.778 --> 05:39.964
Back in many times, he was a Marine in Korea that walked out from Joseon.

05:40.315 --> 05:42.801
but he was one squared away sergeant.

05:42.821 --> 05:49.556
And he took this little shave tail and took care of the business over there to convert me into a platoon leader.

05:50.258 --> 05:54.427
And so as we go through the process there, people are coming in.

05:54.989 --> 05:58.577
I was the 13th officer in that battalion

05:58.557 --> 06:06.210
Should have been 32 of us there, and we were meeting ourselves on the duty roster and pulling details and duty all over Europe.

06:06.250 --> 06:17.049
But one thing about that, the experience that we gained as young officers, we were serving duty about two grades above where we were, and that helped a lot.

06:17.069 --> 06:18.692
We learned fast.

06:18.672 --> 06:20.294
over there because we had to.

06:20.934 --> 06:27.602
I pulled the company commander slot until the colonel decided that he wanted a battalion executive officer.

06:27.642 --> 06:31.566
And at that time, I was the senior ranking first lieutenant in the battalion.

06:32.146 --> 06:37.232
So he pulled me out of the company, put me as his battalion executive officer.

06:37.492 --> 06:38.433
And this was in Germany.

06:38.533 --> 06:39.695
This is still in Germany.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.176
This is in 1967.

06:41.937 --> 06:42.157
Right.

06:42.818 --> 06:48.544
And so we're going on into the fall of 67 and I get orders.

06:48.929 --> 07:05.670
that we're going to go to Fort Riley, Kansas as the advance party for the rotation out of Germany of the first soldiers that were doing that, what was called Operation Reforger, which was simply moving one brigade from Germany and stationed it back in the States.

07:05.770 --> 07:11.637
We need to go ahead and fast forward because the war is heating up obviously in Vietnam and you are called.

07:11.717 --> 07:17.164
You head to California and then August 2nd, 1968, you leave for Vietnam and Saigon.

07:17.144 --> 07:19.489
as a military advisor there.

07:19.651 --> 07:21.248
Talk about we're in Vietnam now.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.235
Talk about what your duty was on the ground.

07:23.375 --> 07:47.303
After I completed the training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina for advisor school, they somehow shipped me over to Defense Language Institute for language training in Vietnamese language, which was necessary because I wound up in a district assignment with the district chief that has both civic responsibility as well as military affairs, police,

07:47.789 --> 07:52.097
health and all affairs, about like a county judge here back in Texas.

07:52.658 --> 07:58.129
General Westmoreland called what we did the Armed Peace Corps over there.

07:58.750 --> 08:08.329
Anyway, I arrived in Vietnam on the fourth day of August, 1968, right in about what they call the third offenses of 1968.

08:08.933 --> 08:22.536
I didn't stay in Saigon very long because it seemed like they ran us through a chute pretty fast, and I wound up down in Kanto, which is the headquarters of 4th Corps in the Delta, the Mekong Delta.

08:22.556 --> 08:29.288
They shipped me out over to Kenwa Province, which is about 40 miles south of

08:29.453 --> 08:41.390
of Saigon and just below Mito and Dongtown where the 2nd Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division operated out of.

08:41.410 --> 08:52.626
So I get into there and Colonel Dunley goes through the briefing with me and he sends me up to Truk Yang District to work with Major Saunders who was the District Senior Advisor

08:53.213 --> 09:02.331
as a break-in deal, just follow him around, kind of orient a little bit about what it was about to be a district advisor, observe how the operations went.

09:02.351 --> 09:09.805
I got up there, and on about the second, third day we were there, Sergeant Huddleston and I

09:10.088 --> 09:16.156
were assigned to go out with the regional popular force that day for that mission.

09:16.176 --> 09:16.777
We went out.

09:17.057 --> 09:22.004
That was my first experience with being shot at, for real.

09:22.324 --> 09:24.567
I think you called it the wrong end of the bullet.

09:24.587 --> 09:28.453
We had some sniper fire coming, and I wasn't launching the rounds.

09:28.513 --> 09:34.961
They were coming at us and zinging by, and that kind of popped a little bit, so I kind of perked up.

09:35.562 --> 09:37.024
Didn't have any problem with that.

09:38.152 --> 09:50.507
Coming back in, though, on the road back to the headquarters there at Truck Gang, we were on a hardtop road, one of the few that was actually open, and a sniper, a far sniper, what we call a distant shot,

09:50.960 --> 10:04.818
took a lucky shot at us and the truck that I was riding in had me in the right front seat of the cab, no cover on it, but there's a post right here behind your head that attaches the canopy to it when you put it on.

10:04.838 --> 10:11.327
That round came zinging in and hit right back in the back of that post, right about where my ear was.

10:11.347 --> 10:13.930
If that old boy had known how to lead a deer,

10:14.568 --> 10:15.610
or a jackrabbit.

10:16.231 --> 10:19.016
We might have had a little different discussion here, Tom.

10:19.697 --> 10:21.780
So that got my attention big time.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.886
We go back up there, and I spend a couple of weeks there.

10:25.667 --> 10:32.419
Then I'm called back into the province headquarters, and Colonel Dunley tells me that they've got an assignment down in Pond Food District.

10:32.779 --> 10:35.144
He's got some problems down there.

10:35.164 --> 10:40.052
Said we've got a little relationship difficulty going on between

10:40.522 --> 10:47.179
who was a captain down there that had been in the class with me, the advisor class there at Fort Bragg.

10:47.199 --> 10:50.547
He got there in May, and now this is September the 1st.

10:50.688 --> 10:55.881
I arrive in Tonfu District, which is the far southeast district

10:55.861 --> 11:01.168
of Kenwa province on the South China Sea bounded by two rivers.

11:01.709 --> 11:03.712
So I've got water all around me.

11:03.732 --> 11:05.214
This is the rainy season.

11:05.274 --> 11:09.360
And again, Tom, I have never seen so much water since Hurricane Carla.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.783
It's wet and there's a bunch down there.

11:12.965 --> 11:16.650
We get in there and I get oriented to what we're doing a little bit.

11:16.670 --> 11:24.180
We take off on a mission shortly after I got there up a road and out to a little outpost in Hamlet.

11:24.515 --> 11:38.112
And I spent a little time there dealing with some of the local merchants and trying to practice my Vietnamese and trying to buy some things from them, trying to get in good with them where they'd think it was a good idea.

11:38.132 --> 11:42.618
We spent a little too much time there, and the district chief got a little turbed at me.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.220
Won't hurry up, hurry up.

11:44.881 --> 11:49.527
Well, as we were going back, there was a command-detonated mine in the road.

11:49.507 --> 11:57.865
But our driver was varying the speed and the guy that had the trigger on the mine couldn't judge that speed either.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.070
And that sucker went off right behind us.

12:00.170 --> 12:03.938
I was sitting on the back of the Jeep there and so most of the stuff went up

12:04.238 --> 12:05.179
around to the back.

12:05.279 --> 12:06.640
I was sitting kind of like this.

12:07.481 --> 12:15.570
And I've got a little souvenir from my glasses that that was about all I got except for a bunch of mud and rock and crap that hit us.

12:15.590 --> 12:17.031
So we get on back in.

12:17.051 --> 12:19.274
This thing rocks on.

12:19.294 --> 12:28.203
That particular district chief had his way of fighting and it was mostly defense and don't mess with them and maybe they won't mess with us.

12:28.223 --> 12:29.284
And I didn't like that.

12:29.821 --> 12:38.447
David, we need to move on because I want to move on to really what I consider the most compelling part of your service and that is talk to us about

12:39.203 --> 12:43.169
the combat operation that resulted in your bonding with the swift boat sailors.

12:43.249 --> 12:44.491
How did that all come about?

12:44.811 --> 12:48.156
And then we're going to get on to what happened in 1995 when you found these guys.

12:48.336 --> 12:53.945
To start with, Tom, the swift boats had patrol areas on those three areas.

12:53.985 --> 12:56.328
We had out on the China Sea and the Two Rivers.

12:56.348 --> 13:00.474
Of course, they were in contact with us before this action takes place in February.

13:00.494 --> 13:05.802
So it really starts in October and November as we're beginning to get acquainted down there.

13:05.782 --> 13:15.054
They're on our radio net, so we're talking to these guys and bringing them in and up to the riverbanks and talking to them, dealing with them.

13:15.074 --> 13:31.435
And I asked the skipper, Lieutenant Keith Evans, one of the OICs out there, officer in charge, could he by chance haul Vietnamese troops down into the base area because we were walking infantry and we had no transport.

13:31.887 --> 13:33.489
Well, he says, I'll check it out.

13:33.509 --> 13:38.216
He heads back up to Kanto, to Cat Lowe, their base.

13:38.937 --> 13:43.924
And boy, that night we get Roger back, says where you want to go and how many and when you want to do it.

13:44.565 --> 13:46.708
So that started the relationship.

13:46.728 --> 13:52.556
They also were firing harassment and interdiction fires for us all through that month.

13:52.576 --> 13:57.102
Well, the key thing that happened was in November, we got a change in district chief.

13:57.773 --> 14:02.928
Dawe Thiet Lung Duc came in to become district chief there.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.515
And he had been in North Vietnam.

14:05.736 --> 14:11.833
He is a North Vietnamese and had been a communist prisoner up there after the petition.

14:12.303 --> 14:17.888
Dowie Dook had no love lost whatsoever for the BC, as you might imagine.

14:17.988 --> 14:20.410
So anyway, we get close coordination.

14:20.450 --> 14:24.314
The Navy is hauling us and moving us, firing for us.

14:24.334 --> 14:29.078
And number one thing is they let us clean out their refrigerator when the operation is over.

14:29.238 --> 14:33.202
So we had a very close working relationship with those sailors.

14:33.222 --> 14:40.909
I got to know them personally and individually, those officers in charge, when they would come in because I would be with the maneuver element.

14:41.092 --> 14:45.657
and they would report to me to coordinate and be a liaison with them.

14:45.678 --> 14:47.139
What happened that night in February?

14:47.760 --> 15:01.557
Well, as we're getting ready to build a new outpost, this new district chief wants to push the BC away from us and get them where they can't fire rockets and mortars at us, and I thought that was the number one good idea.

15:01.577 --> 15:11.048
To do that, we had to secure the area, and we did that by moving in troops, sweeping the area, and then when we could gain the security advantage,

15:11.028 --> 15:16.895
we would build one of those French triangular outposts, a mud fort.

15:16.915 --> 15:21.702
We were in the process of doing that in late January, 1969.

15:24.145 --> 15:31.875
We had just received January 31st, a RF company that came in, brand spanking new company.

15:32.195 --> 15:39.364
So anyway, we've got intel from the Navy, from the Vietnamese and everybody else that people are infiltrating into our area down there.

15:39.698 --> 15:43.402
And they're moving in for what we know is going to be an attack.

15:43.422 --> 15:44.703
I'm reading the intel.

15:45.143 --> 15:46.565
I'm getting it from the Vietnamese.

15:46.645 --> 15:51.810
The Navy is giving us the same stuff, that there's big movement coming into Tom Phu.

15:51.830 --> 15:58.956
And I'm pretty sure, I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure that that outpost at Anwar, they don't like it.

15:58.976 --> 16:00.958
And somebody's going to try to take us out.

16:01.139 --> 16:02.059
And you need some help.

16:02.079 --> 16:03.861
So we're out there.

16:04.262 --> 16:06.103
We have two men in there.

16:06.163 --> 16:08.946
It's a two-man rule for the advisor team.

16:09.128 --> 16:20.853
And that night on February the 2nd Sergeant Barnett was out, slipped and fell on a rice paddy dike and either broke or severely sprained his ankle.

16:20.893 --> 16:23.198
So he's out there and can't walk.

16:23.238 --> 16:26.625
And an infantry guy that can't walk is a liability.

16:26.645 --> 16:29.010
So back at the district headquarters where I was,

16:29.463 --> 16:31.887
We had a decision we had to make.

16:31.907 --> 16:41.383
We're either going to have to get out there and pull the two Americans out or we had to figure out some way to get the injured sergeant out and somebody was going to have to take his place.

16:41.904 --> 16:45.430
Well, there wasn't an infantry sergeant back there at the team.

16:45.450 --> 16:49.277
He was on leave and I was volunteered.

16:49.662 --> 16:50.063
to go.

16:50.363 --> 16:51.945
So how did the swift boats come into this?

16:52.286 --> 17:03.923
The swift boats were on patrol up the river and we had a brand new ensign I find out 26 years later that was in charge of that patrol boat.

17:03.943 --> 17:11.454
They had strict orders that they were not supposed to leave the wide rivers at night and certainly not alone.

17:12.055 --> 17:17.222
But one of the Navy friends we had up at Cat Lowe, the operations officer,

17:17.776 --> 17:25.827
Lieutenant D'Amica, had told this ensign, now when you go down there to Tan Fu, he says, don't you let anything happen to those advisors.

17:25.847 --> 17:26.849
They're our friends.

17:27.630 --> 17:45.775
Well, about 1.15 in the morning, Charlie opened up on us with mortars, 60 millimeter mortar, and that first round hit on that incomplete berm that was about chest high to me, right above my left ear.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.815
And that woke me up.

17:47.835 --> 17:52.400
And the swift boats, out of this, we need to get, we've got about seven minutes left to go in the show now.

17:52.420 --> 18:03.914
The swift boats were upriver when I got on the radio, started hollering, uniform Sierra in contact, fire mission, fire mission, uniform Sierra in contact.

18:04.115 --> 18:11.364
Well, this swift boat answers the call, but this is a new crew and they're not sure where to go.

18:11.384 --> 18:14.968
They finally find the inlet, they get in the canal,

18:15.488 --> 18:19.092
because they cannot meet the target.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.814
Their range is too far.

18:21.314 --> 18:24.538
The only way to get there, they have to come up in this canal.

18:24.998 --> 18:26.800
I don't know any of this in 1969.

18:28.262 --> 18:41.877
We're being hit from the left side by battalion size attack that our RF company is trying to handle and our 26 men in the PF platoon are fully occupied.

18:42.197 --> 18:43.639
We're firing artillery.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.834
and trying to hold our own.

18:46.855 --> 18:57.111
About that time, the VC attack, which was a little bit disorganized, opened up a second flanking attack to our right, which was to the south.

18:58.232 --> 19:03.401
And boy, that caused all kinds of trouble because we didn't have anything we could put down there on that south.

19:03.481 --> 19:05.003
We were fully occupied

19:05.337 --> 19:09.040
with what we were contending with on the north flank.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.122
That swift boat answered that call.

19:11.142 --> 19:21.432
They managed to get up river and then upstream in that canal, and they don't know how long it took them to get there, and I don't know either, and it was a long time, and it was too long.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.893
I told them.

19:22.913 --> 19:33.623
When they got there, they opened up with the first round, and that first 81 mortar round landed right smack in the front lead element of that second flanking attack.

19:34.261 --> 19:41.391
They must have hit the leader because when that round hit, that attack just kind of disintegrated out there.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.054
You could see the disorganization.

19:43.114 --> 19:49.403
We could see movement out there and could actually observe because some of our artillery rounds were firing flares.

19:49.423 --> 19:59.137
When I gave that Navy swift boat, target correct, fire for effect, give me all you got and give it to me now, was the communication tool.

19:59.658 --> 20:03.323
They started dropping rounds down that tube just as fast as they could.

20:03.978 --> 20:11.430
We find out later in 95, they overheated the barrel and they violated a few rules of engagement and a few other Navy rules.

20:11.450 --> 20:16.338
And some of the rules find out were actually court martial offenses.

20:16.358 --> 20:19.623
So anyway, they break up that attack on our flank.

20:19.643 --> 20:23.189
We're holding our own up there on the left flank.

20:23.209 --> 20:25.733
And by about an hour later,

20:26.050 --> 20:32.245
We've pretty well handled the situation, defeated the attack, and we believe the B.C.

20:32.727 --> 20:35.714
are now trying to withdraw and recover from the battlefield.

20:36.095 --> 20:39.704
And the swift boat has gone up the river and you don't hear from them again until 26 years later.

20:39.724 --> 20:40.987
We'll talk about that in a minute.

20:41.027 --> 20:42.591
But, David, right now I want to go to some pictures.

20:42.723 --> 20:50.873
from some of your service in Vietnam, and we're going to go through these quickly because as it's so unfortunate each time, we do run out of time.

20:50.913 --> 20:56.159
But if we could go ahead and go to this first picture, talk about what we're looking at right here.

20:56.199 --> 20:58.862
Okay, right there you've got PCF number 98.

20:58.922 --> 21:06.992
That's a swift boat that was hauling our troops, and they're offloading the Vietnamese soldiers that I fought, lived, and some of them died with me.

21:06.972 --> 21:16.365
Those are Vietnamese RF troops, which in Texas we'd call that a National Guard outfit, poorly trained and not well equipped.

21:16.385 --> 21:17.807
They did not have M-16s.

21:17.827 --> 21:18.948
Now this is you on the left?

21:19.509 --> 21:23.355
That is me on the left, and that's what we call the Freedom Bird, Tom.

21:23.955 --> 21:33.148
That's on July the 16th, 1969, as I'm leaving my post, been relieved that I'm heading out

21:33.618 --> 21:37.362
for the big PX back in America, but that's the freedom bird.

21:38.043 --> 21:38.784
Talk about this picture.

21:39.305 --> 21:45.292
These are the little guys that fought with us tonight.

21:45.312 --> 21:49.497
We almost got wiped out.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.520
That's the RF-246 company.

21:52.941 --> 21:55.864
There was man spanking new, fresh guys.

21:55.884 --> 21:57.846
You'll notice they've only got carbines.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.448
We were outgunned.

21:59.588 --> 22:03.473
We were outmanned about four to one, and they fought like hell.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.538
You're obviously very proud to serve with them.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.680
There's no doubt about that.

22:07.181 --> 22:08.844
They were great fighters.

22:08.864 --> 22:10.847
Now, this was the gentleman.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.429
This is Tip Lung Duk.

22:12.449 --> 22:28.614
That is Dawee Duk, my counterpart, who unfortunately, after the communists took him into a re-education camp, and we have information that Dawee Duk died of dysentery in 1977.

22:28.755 --> 22:32.160
Here's a picture you just showed me this morning.

22:32.512 --> 22:33.173
Oh, yes.

22:33.193 --> 22:35.415
This one is a fantastic story.

22:35.435 --> 22:37.617
This is the Navy supply.

22:37.637 --> 22:42.901
That's cold milk, Tom, out in the Mekong Delta when it's about 110.

22:42.981 --> 22:46.284
And orange in my hand.

22:46.304 --> 22:47.886
That's me on the left there.

22:50.228 --> 22:52.670
This is the swift boat crew.

22:52.690 --> 22:53.811
This is my crew.

22:53.871 --> 22:55.353
That's PCF-56.

22:56.874 --> 23:01.438
That's Ensign Frankie standing there, the guy with the beard.

23:02.228 --> 23:05.614
And the guy, the tall guy on the far side, that's Tex.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.637
He's the 50 caliber gunner.

23:08.479 --> 23:11.824
What I'm going to do now before I show the next picture, I want to go back to you.

23:12.105 --> 23:16.372
And I want you to talk about, in the little time we have left, about what happened in 1995.

23:16.472 --> 23:19.698
It was a reunion of these swift boats in Washington, D.C.

23:20.059 --> 23:20.640
That's correct.

23:20.760 --> 23:27.932
In 1995 in June, we had a reunion when we had found two swift boats down in Panama.

23:28.621 --> 23:37.749
They brought those boats up, but the Navy did, and one of them now, PCF-1, is at the Navy Historical Society in the Washington Navy Yard.

23:38.451 --> 23:42.563
This caused us to gather all hands on deck

23:43.032 --> 23:48.121
and have a reunion, the first one that they had had to dedicate that swift boat.

23:48.662 --> 24:03.668
As we were up there meeting and greeting and doing with people, I wound up joining the Swift Boat Sailors Association as a charter member, Tom, airborne infantry, but I'm a charter member and they consider me one of them.

24:03.688 --> 24:03.989
Indeed.

24:05.231 --> 24:08.196
As that reunion got underway,

24:08.581 --> 24:13.646
I kept asking a question, were any of you guys on the rivers February 2, 3, 69?

24:13.726 --> 24:15.648
Did anybody know the crew that was down there?

24:15.668 --> 24:19.071
Because I'd been looking for these guys and nobody could tell me where they were.

24:20.032 --> 24:27.680
Finally, on Sunday, as we were leaving the hotel, going down for breakfast, there was a table and there was two spaces.

24:27.740 --> 24:30.503
My daughter was there with me.

24:30.523 --> 24:34.707
And so I sat down and started asking the question, were any of you all there?

24:35.260 --> 24:39.127
And sure enough, one of the guys recognized part of what I was asking.

24:39.167 --> 24:44.917
He said to Ensign Frankie, you know Bill, we were in that area about that time.

24:44.957 --> 24:45.758
Wasn't that us?

24:46.199 --> 24:48.243
That sounds kind of like maybe what we did.

24:48.323 --> 24:50.687
And Bill started talking to me.

24:50.819 --> 24:52.301
Bill Franke is the ensign.

24:52.942 --> 25:01.815
And so we are talking back and forth, repeating the radio communications between the two of us, me in the outpost, him in the swift boat.

25:01.915 --> 25:07.964
And there is no way, Tom, that we could mistake because there's only the two of us that know some of that exchange.

25:08.024 --> 25:12.231
And some of it I'm not real proud of because it was pretty fluent Navy French.

25:12.431 --> 25:15.656
So 26 years later, you found the guys and we showed the picture a second ago.

25:15.676 --> 25:16.838
I don't know, can we go back to it?

25:16.858 --> 25:17.839
There it is again.

25:17.819 --> 25:20.924
And there's the fellows that 26 years later you found.

25:21.124 --> 25:22.446
We found part of the crew.

25:22.466 --> 25:24.590
We found two of the crew members.

25:24.610 --> 25:29.417
And it happened to be Sunday, the 17th of June on Father's Day.

25:30.098 --> 25:32.883
That's Way Smith or Way Sims on the left.

25:32.943 --> 25:36.148
He was the guy running the mortar crew.

25:36.668 --> 25:40.513
And the one on the right there, it will be on the left the way you're seeing it.

25:41.194 --> 25:48.924
That's Ensign Branke, 26 years later, and that's Diwi Kovon Marion in the middle there.

25:48.944 --> 25:51.247
So we finally managed up and found him.

25:51.848 --> 25:55.633
And the reason we had so much trouble is they didn't file an action report.

25:55.673 --> 26:02.001
They filed no paperwork on this thing because they were facing a court martial and a board of inquiry

26:02.656 --> 26:08.924
if they had been caught off the river by themselves in the situation that they put themselves in.

26:09.625 --> 26:20.680
But they tell me, even today, knowing what they know about the hazard, knowing what they know about the gun, knowing what they did when they got that hang fire, they'd all do it again.

26:20.700 --> 26:25.166
Your story would take hours and hours and days to tell, but that's all the time we have for this.

26:25.246 --> 26:28.731
And I thank you very, very much for your service, David Marion, and thank you for being here.

26:29.268 --> 26:39.618
One thing, Tom, we want them to know that we fought the battles and we held the line and not a single place fell after we made the stand in Vietnam.

26:39.658 --> 26:42.921
The communists were stopped, not another country.

26:43.542 --> 26:44.222
Absolutely.

26:44.242 --> 26:45.824
And thank you for your service.

26:45.844 --> 26:51.829
There is that natural rivalry between Army and Navy, but that mostly plays itself out on the football field each fall.

26:51.889 --> 26:55.613
To Army Captain David Marion, it's no rivalry, it's a brotherhood.

26:55.913 --> 27:00.279
We salute the service of Vietnam veteran David P. Marion and salute all veterans.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.364
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:03.384 --> 27:04.705
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:04.725 --> 27:06.592
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
[Silence.]

27:13.115 --> 27:23.775
[Music.]

27:24.000 --> 27:38.000
