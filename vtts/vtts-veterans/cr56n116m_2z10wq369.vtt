00:09.110 --> 00:34.119
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.139 --> 00:35.320
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.650 --> 00:42.016
This November the 23rd, Eddie Thompson of College Station will turn 98 years old.

00:42.036 --> 00:49.806
His life that started in 1907 has spanned nearly a decade of history, including both World War I and World War II.

00:51.047 --> 00:56.373
At 35, he was older than most volunteers when he joined the Navy in 1942.

00:57.294 --> 01:01.019
Join the Navy and see the world, he figured, and he was right.

01:01.039 --> 01:02.961
At least most of the Pacific Theater

01:03.329 --> 01:08.294
from the deck of the proud cruiser USS Birmingham, CL-62.

01:09.656 --> 01:21.389
By the time Eddie Thompson got his orders, the Birmingham had already fought battles as part of the Atlantic fleet, giving gunfire support in the invasion of Sicily in the summer of 43.

01:22.310 --> 01:32.661
But then it was sent to the Pacific, arriving in Pearl Harbor in September of that year, and then off to do battle in Saipan, in Guam, the Leyte Gulf, just to name a few.

01:34.379 --> 01:42.349
When Eddie Thompson boarded in January of 1945, there were still battles to fight at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

01:42.369 --> 01:52.501
On May 4th, 1945, after fighting off three attacks, the Birmingham was damaged a third time when a Japanese suicide plane hit her forward.

01:52.522 --> 01:55.946
Eddie Thompson was in the cabin right next to where the plane hit.

01:57.287 --> 02:02.614
And now 60 years later, we're glad he's here to tell the story of his service.

02:03.016 --> 02:07.302
Mr. Thompson, it is really an honor to have you here visiting with us.

02:07.322 --> 02:07.963
Well, thank you.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.024
It's an honor to be here.

02:09.565 --> 02:12.709
Before we start talking about your service with the U.S.

02:12.729 --> 02:17.095
Navy, I want to talk about the Baker Hotel in downtown Dallas.

02:17.115 --> 02:20.039
That was a large part of your life before you joined the service.

02:20.059 --> 02:20.780
Twelve years.

02:22.142 --> 02:22.803
What did you do there?

02:23.524 --> 02:25.266
Well, it started out as a bellhop.

02:25.446 --> 02:32.095
The bellman, you know, they help people carry luggage and show them to the rooms and do whatever they can for them.

02:32.716 --> 02:39.467
And then I got to be bell captain, and then I got to be night manager of the hotel.

02:39.527 --> 02:44.495
Came on at 11 o'clock at night and got off at 7 the next morning.

02:44.515 --> 02:49.643
And I didn't like the night work, but I had to do it anyway.

02:49.663 --> 02:50.364
Back then?

02:51.045 --> 02:51.125
Huh?

02:51.446 --> 02:54.911
Back then, Dallas was a lot different town than it is now.

02:54.931 --> 02:55.212
Oh, yeah.

02:55.232 --> 02:57.054
Everything was right downtown then.

02:58.076 --> 03:00.580
Yeah, those suburbs weren't out there.

03:01.589 --> 03:04.873
You had the Baker Hotel, and right across the street was the Adolphus Hotel.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.694
That's right, yeah.

03:06.034 --> 03:07.696
The Baker's not there anymore.

03:07.716 --> 03:07.936
Right.

03:07.976 --> 03:09.698
I don't think either is the Adolphus either.

03:09.758 --> 03:10.179
Everything's changed.

03:10.199 --> 03:12.702
I don't know about the Adolphus.

03:12.722 --> 03:17.447
But they blew the Baker down and put a telephone bell in up there.

03:18.488 --> 03:23.074
I guess as a bellhop, you probably toted luggage for a lot of famous people.

03:23.094 --> 03:24.055
Yes, I sure did.

03:24.395 --> 03:30.482
I can't think of all of them right now, but I did a lot of them.

03:31.171 --> 03:35.255
Probably saw a lot of governors and political people and everything.

03:35.636 --> 03:37.158
A lot of comedians and all that.

03:37.578 --> 03:38.559
Bob Hope even.

03:39.160 --> 03:39.921
He was down there.

03:40.882 --> 03:42.203
You carried his luggage for him, huh?

03:42.303 --> 03:42.564
Yeah.

03:43.745 --> 03:44.626
Yeah.

03:44.646 --> 03:50.252
Then in 1942, you were relatively old when you volunteered, enlisted in the Navy.

03:50.272 --> 03:50.933
That's right.

03:50.953 --> 03:52.274
Why did you go Navy?

03:52.554 --> 03:55.117
Well, I didn't want to be drafted and put in the Army.

03:55.918 --> 03:57.600
I just wanted to be in the Navy.

03:58.188 --> 04:00.992
instead of the Army, so I made a choice.

04:03.897 --> 04:16.395
Like I say, the government declared the hotel industry essential to the war effort, and key personnel would not be drafted indefinitely.

04:16.435 --> 04:21.883
They just probably would never be drafted, and I was key personnel.

04:22.464 --> 04:23.706
I was the night manager.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.051
of the Baker Hotel.

04:26.172 --> 04:30.477
And so I stayed there.

04:32.920 --> 04:38.366
See, they put me in a Navy office just as soon as I enlisted and was sworn in.

04:38.426 --> 04:42.290
They put me in an office, and I worked in that office two years.

04:42.750 --> 04:50.699
Finally, I went out to Shoemaker, California, at the receiving station, and I was assigned to the Birmingham.

04:51.961 --> 04:53.322
And I was on it.

04:53.673 --> 04:54.674
Almost a year.

04:55.135 --> 04:58.759
Now, the office you were in was the Office of Naval Procurement, is that right?

04:59.319 --> 05:02.022
Office of Naval Officer Procurement, right.

05:02.142 --> 05:03.584
What did you learn there?

05:03.604 --> 05:08.069
Well, I just learned how to handle people, you know, trying to talk.

05:08.409 --> 05:14.196
I had to get them to fill out papers, one thing or another, and that's what I did, you know.

05:14.216 --> 05:20.963
I had forms of all kinds to fill out, and I had to see that they did it right.

05:21.736 --> 05:26.580
And I learned in some crazy ones and then some good ones.

05:26.600 --> 05:31.425
They figured that you were a people person working at the Baker Hotel, and that was a good job for you.

05:31.445 --> 05:31.565
Yeah.

05:32.026 --> 05:34.368
Well, I learned a little how to handle people.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.931
That's what they seemed to think.

05:37.951 --> 05:47.700
And when they found out I worked at the Baker Hotel, they immediately assigned me to this Office of Naval Officer Procurement.

05:48.501 --> 05:50.983
And that's what I was in.

05:51.537 --> 06:01.649
until January of 45, they closed office.

06:01.669 --> 06:05.754
And I went to this receiving station and drew the Birmingham.

06:05.774 --> 06:07.015
That's how come me on it.

06:07.816 --> 06:14.183
When you went to the Birmingham, did you know then that the Birmingham was a pretty active cruiser in the war already?

06:14.204 --> 06:14.924
No, no, I didn't.

06:14.964 --> 06:15.625
I didn't know it.

06:16.346 --> 06:18.068
No, I found out later.

06:18.757 --> 06:21.541
I found out about a lot of history of it.

06:22.062 --> 06:22.322
Right.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.065
You were on a pretty active ship.

06:24.085 --> 06:26.008
What was your job on the Birmingham?

06:26.028 --> 06:28.592
Well, we were in the computer room, they called it.

06:29.032 --> 06:32.357
We had instruments that aimed the guns.

06:33.239 --> 06:38.366
And the guns were in a mount up on the decks, you know.

06:38.947 --> 06:42.412
And they can't fire, can't do anything unless an officer tells them to.

06:43.073 --> 06:47.059
And we were in the room, five decks down in that ship.

06:47.596 --> 06:53.681
We were connected with phones to the Tuarts, and we told them what to do.

06:54.282 --> 06:57.064
They couldn't do anything unless we told them to.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.788
And that was part of it.

07:00.968 --> 07:02.569
I had a telephone.

07:02.629 --> 07:06.693
I was talking to somebody in the Tuarts or somewhere all the time.

07:07.113 --> 07:08.654
I was connected with them, you see.

07:09.835 --> 07:13.118
So you pretty much told them where to shoot the guns and when to shoot them, right?

07:13.138 --> 07:13.819
We told them, yeah.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.282
We had to tell them when to shoot the guns and where to shoot them.

07:18.022 --> 07:21.267
They couldn't fire unless somebody told them to.

07:22.709 --> 07:27.716
Let's talk about the islands that you were either on or you floated real near.

07:27.857 --> 07:33.024
You told me a list of some of the islands in the Pacific that you had experience with.

07:33.105 --> 07:34.166
What were some of the islands?

07:34.186 --> 07:36.249
Well, Guam was one.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.616
Like I told you, my brother was on a sign there.

07:40.636 --> 07:42.679
He was stationed on Guam.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.822
And my ship came in there.

07:45.241 --> 07:48.345
to get a hull patch so we could get to Pearl Harbor.

07:48.986 --> 07:57.978
And while they were doing that, I got permission to go over on this island and visit him, which is the island of Guam.

07:58.940 --> 08:09.594
And so he was a chief petty officer, and he was a cook, chief commissary, Stuart, they called it.

08:09.835 --> 08:10.095
Right.

08:10.536 --> 08:14.421
And he was stationed there, so I got to visit him.

08:15.042 --> 08:18.827
And then I was assigned.

08:21.771 --> 08:36.091
When the war was over, well, I was still on the ship, and they said that all the people that were eligible to go home could go home now or stay with the ship, whatever you want to do.

08:37.072 --> 08:44.863
So 27 of us wanted to leave the ship, and we got a 30-man tent, pitched on the side of a hill.

08:45.046 --> 08:51.512
on Okinawa and lived there 10 days waiting for a troop ship to bring me back to the States.

08:52.293 --> 08:54.255
And finally I got back to San Francisco.

08:55.556 --> 08:57.598
So you lived 10 days on the side of a hill?

08:57.798 --> 08:58.579
That's right.

08:58.799 --> 08:59.520
On Okinawa.

08:59.720 --> 09:00.400
On Okinawa.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.341
What was the weather like?

09:02.242 --> 09:02.643
Rainy.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.625
Rainy and mosquitoes.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.228
That was two of the worst things.

09:08.248 --> 09:12.792
Boy, those mosquitoes nearly drug us off.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.912
Some of the other islands that you remember, you listed a bunch of the islands in the Pacific.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.614
Well, I didn't visit any of them.

09:19.694 --> 09:21.777
I was just close to them, you know.

09:21.877 --> 09:22.318
Right.

09:22.338 --> 09:34.493
We were, what is it, Kwajalein, Santa Fe, and Indy, we talked, Saipan, Tanyan, Guam, Ulite, Iwo Jima, Karamaroto, Iashima, and Okinawa.

09:35.182 --> 09:36.884
Now, you saw some action.

09:36.904 --> 09:41.730
There were some battles that you all fought, particularly in Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

09:41.810 --> 09:42.270
That's right.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.433
Some smaller battles in other places.

09:44.493 --> 09:48.397
But what do you remember about the battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa?

09:48.618 --> 10:02.674
Well, I remember that we were just tense all the time because those Japs' suicide planes had instructions to dive into the biggest ship they could find.

10:03.093 --> 10:08.441
We were just leery all the time that they were going to dive into us and scared of it, you know.

10:09.102 --> 10:11.205
So we had to live with it.

10:11.886 --> 10:13.108
And finally one did.

10:13.288 --> 10:19.197
Like I told you, it killed 51 men and wounded 80 men.

10:19.357 --> 10:23.503
That's one suicide plane.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.446
And we're going to talk more about that later.

10:25.486 --> 10:30.754
That happened on May the 4th in 1945 about the kamikaze plane that...

10:31.477 --> 10:33.240
killed a lot of your shipmates.

10:33.280 --> 10:42.473
But what I'd like to do now is we're going to show the audience some photographs, and I'll talk about them, and I'll tell you what's up on the screen now as we take a look.

10:42.493 --> 10:45.638
First off, this is the USS Birmingham.

10:45.698 --> 10:52.448
That is a picture of the proud ship, CL-62, which served so proudly in the war.

10:52.468 --> 10:58.176
And from what I understand, looking in the Internet, I believe that it is docked now in San Francisco.

10:58.865 --> 11:02.110
from what I understand, I guess, and people can visit it.

11:02.130 --> 11:04.153
But that's quite a ship.

11:04.213 --> 11:10.362
And I know that you told me, Mr. Thompson, that it had 40 gun barrels.

11:10.442 --> 11:11.063
Is that right?

11:11.143 --> 11:12.945
It was a large ship.

11:12.965 --> 11:22.820
Different size, 20 millimeters and 40 millimeters and, you know, 5-inch guns and 6-inch guns.

11:24.883 --> 11:28.568
It was four different kind of guns on that ship.

11:30.893 --> 11:34.797
And you probably knew every one of them since you were in the computer room telling them how to shoot them.

11:34.817 --> 11:35.197
That's right.

11:36.158 --> 11:41.083
See, they can't open a fire unless they're told what to do.

11:42.985 --> 11:47.049
If they're going to fire that gun, they're going to have to be told by an officer.

11:47.930 --> 11:50.452
Got another photograph that I want the audience to see now.

11:50.492 --> 11:55.237
This is a photograph that was taken on the USS Birmingham.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.559
As a matter of fact, this picture actually hangs

11:57.893 --> 12:02.018
in your apartment here in College Station, and we borrowed it for this.

12:02.038 --> 12:15.352
And if I was told correctly, I believe, pardon my pen here, that this is Seaman First Class Thompson right there with his crew on the USS Birmingham.

12:15.372 --> 12:18.716
You know the picture that we're talking about that we're showing the audience, Mr. Thompson.

12:18.756 --> 12:20.938
It's the one that hangs on your wall.

12:21.019 --> 12:23.061
Talk a little bit about that picture.

12:23.081 --> 12:25.483
Do you remember when it was taken?

12:25.503 --> 12:26.064
Yes, I do.

12:26.304 --> 12:26.905
I sure do.

12:27.442 --> 12:30.946
But I didn't know that I'd ever get one.

12:32.148 --> 12:35.252
Luckily, I got one.

12:35.312 --> 12:38.556
How many were on the Birmingham?

12:38.576 --> 12:40.519
I think you said... 1,300 men.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.763
It was a wartime crew.

12:43.783 --> 12:44.183
1,300.

12:44.203 --> 12:44.544
Yeah.

12:46.386 --> 12:49.210
Okay, let's go to May the 4th, 1945.

12:50.691 --> 12:55.137
A suicide Japanese plane attacks the USS Birmingham.

12:55.505 --> 12:57.628
What do you remember about that day and what happened?

12:57.728 --> 13:00.031
Well, I remember I was just scared to death nearly.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.914
I didn't know what was going on.

13:02.855 --> 13:08.463
We heard the alarms and things on the ship that was danger out there.

13:09.064 --> 13:13.991
And we just were walking around in the daze because we didn't know what to do.

13:14.011 --> 13:23.605
And all at once this ship next door to me, I mean, this plane hit carrying a 500-pound bomb.

13:24.108 --> 13:38.502
And it dove in, even the medical department, the hospital part was hit and killed some men that was in there as patients.

13:38.522 --> 13:43.647
So it's just unbelievable how things happened out there.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.812
Did you stay in your cabin or what was your first reaction?

13:48.832 --> 13:53.457
I stayed in my apartment until we found out what was going on.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.895
Because we didn't know anything about what happened.

13:57.915 --> 13:59.617
We had to wait and find out.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.861
And 51 of your shipmates were killed?

14:02.881 --> 14:04.823
51, yeah.

14:05.964 --> 14:07.205
And several more were injured.

14:07.726 --> 14:10.769
Oh, 80 of them were wounded.

14:12.671 --> 14:15.274
This wasn't the first time that the Birmingham had been hit.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.017
I believe it was the third time it had been hit by a suicide plane.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.880
Yeah, that's the only time it was hit while I was on it.

14:21.161 --> 14:21.601
Right.

14:21.621 --> 14:23.443
I wasn't on it the other time.

14:23.947 --> 14:28.492
See, you know the story, you've heard it about the Princeton.

14:28.792 --> 14:29.092
Yes, sir.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.895
It killed 200 men.

14:32.335 --> 14:38.622
The Princeton was a carrier, aircraft carrier, and it had caught fire.

14:38.642 --> 14:46.029
And the weeple pulled alongside to squirt water on it, and it was pretty close.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.212
And about nearly all the guys that wasn't

14:49.630 --> 14:54.276
doing something else, they were out there just watching stuff, you know, observers.

14:55.257 --> 14:59.122
And it killed 50, it killed 200 of them.

14:59.142 --> 15:02.486
They were spectators, all it was to it, mostly.

15:02.506 --> 15:07.132
And it killed 200 of them and wounded about 300.

15:08.453 --> 15:13.119
So it sure was a terrible thing that Princeton was.

15:13.319 --> 15:14.400
Of course, they all are.

15:14.881 --> 15:15.282
Indeed.

15:15.802 --> 15:18.085
But that's one of the worst things I ever heard of.

15:18.655 --> 15:19.156
That's right.

15:19.516 --> 15:25.744
Matter of fact, I was visiting with Mr. Thompson the other day, and I told him kind of an ironic story myself.

15:25.824 --> 15:30.429
My mother's first husband was a World War II Navy pilot.

15:30.449 --> 15:40.381
His name was Lieutenant Bob Butler, and his unit, VF-27, was a unit that flew F6F Hellcats.

15:41.142 --> 15:45.928
And VF-27 was actually the Hellcat unit that was on the Princeton at that time.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.747
My mother's husband at the time wasn't there.

15:49.787 --> 15:53.843
He had actually been killed about two months before in a training exercise.

15:54.262 --> 16:00.810
But it was his mates that were actually on the Princeton at the time when it came in contact with the Birmingham.

16:00.830 --> 16:06.737
That, I believe, was in October of 1944, actually, before you boarded the USS Birmingham.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.397
That's right, yeah.

16:07.918 --> 16:13.564
And you talked a little bit about your brother, about meeting up with him in Guam.

16:13.585 --> 16:19.511
That's something that every Navy person doesn't get to do, is meet up with a relative during wartime.

16:19.652 --> 16:20.152
That's right.

16:20.553 --> 16:22.615
I got to visit him one time.

16:23.067 --> 16:27.192
It's on, and I was just lucky enough to do it.

16:28.234 --> 16:31.458
We got hit at Okinawa.

16:31.959 --> 16:40.570
We worked about two days out of Okinawa, I mean out of Guam, and they had a floating dry dock down there.

16:40.810 --> 16:41.491
Yes, sir.

16:41.511 --> 16:45.396
And this ship needed hull patched.

16:45.899 --> 16:56.393
So we received orders to go down to Guam and get this hull patched so we could get to Pearl Harbor.

16:56.413 --> 16:57.574
So that's what we did.

16:58.716 --> 17:02.020
And my brother was there.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.764
We were there a couple of days, and I got to visit him twice.

17:05.565 --> 17:08.929
We've got another photograph I want the audience to see.

17:09.090 --> 17:12.875
Speaking of your brother, Pete, we've got a picture here.

17:14.076 --> 17:14.657
And...

17:15.008 --> 17:17.932
I'm going to adjust it here a little bit so we can see a little bit better.

17:17.972 --> 17:18.452
There we go.

17:19.373 --> 17:24.880
This is Seaman First Class Eddie Thompson right here.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.123
And this is his brother Pete right over here.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.545
And this is his wife.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.929
And this is Eddie's wife, Betty.

17:31.949 --> 17:33.931
And this is Pete's son.

17:33.971 --> 17:37.435
And in this photograph, I know, Mr. Thompson, you can't see it.

17:37.455 --> 17:39.598
Your niece, Sharon Colson, gave it to us.

17:40.068 --> 17:50.039
Pete is pointing out on a globe, I guess, where you and he had been to one of your nephews in this photograph.

17:50.099 --> 17:55.025
So that's a wonderful family picture that your niece Sharon Coulson shared with us.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.147
Well, that's good.

17:57.207 --> 17:57.828
I didn't know it.

17:58.028 --> 18:01.372
Yep, yep, yep.

18:01.392 --> 18:06.017
Let's talk a little bit more about the Birmingham and just the pure size of this ship.

18:06.037 --> 18:08.640
You say that it had 40 guns on it.

18:08.992 --> 18:11.235
And 1,300 people.

18:11.275 --> 18:16.741
I guess during the course of a war, I guess you don't get to meet all of them, even though you're on the same craft.

18:16.801 --> 18:17.422
That's right.

18:17.562 --> 18:18.102
That's right.

18:20.505 --> 18:21.066
Oh, man.

18:23.248 --> 18:27.153
You couldn't meet all that 1,300 crew members, you know.

18:28.054 --> 18:35.743
And a lot of times we had passengers that were going out to board their ship.

18:36.043 --> 18:37.024
They were taking us.

18:37.561 --> 18:45.388
We went the closest to him, where his ship was, and he'd go with us on the Birmingham.

18:45.408 --> 18:51.954
And when we got close to where his ship was, they'd let him off, and he'd go back to his ship.

18:52.354 --> 18:53.535
Right, right.

18:54.476 --> 19:03.423
You fought, besides Okinawa and Iwo Jima, there were other island battles that you fought from offshore.

19:04.264 --> 19:07.467
Yeah, just aircraft.

19:08.020 --> 19:14.668
You know, that's what we were fighting, and we did some shore bombardment.

19:15.970 --> 19:26.023
We had a man, a spotter, they called it, on the beach, and he'd tell us where to shoot, and we did that.

19:26.043 --> 19:28.786
They called it a call fire.

19:28.806 --> 19:32.391
When they called for fire in a certain area, well, we did it.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.888
You were 10 months on the Birmingham.

19:35.988 --> 19:39.133
During that amount of time, I can imagine you saw all kinds of weather.

19:39.794 --> 19:42.338
As a matter of fact, you told me that you endured a typhoon or two.

19:42.358 --> 19:47.907
I was in a typhoon one time, and that ship, it was really high wind.

19:47.987 --> 19:52.734
I don't know what the speed of the wind was, but the ship would just go like that.

19:54.938 --> 19:57.682
And I'd say, it's coming back up.

19:57.702 --> 20:01.568
It's not coming back up, but the bow would go down.

20:01.936 --> 20:04.238
And I said, it's not coming back up this time.

20:04.779 --> 20:05.360
But it did.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.843
Did you get seasick?

20:08.863 --> 20:09.824
Did you get seasick?

20:10.005 --> 20:10.265
No.

20:10.705 --> 20:12.287
Luckily, I wasn't the type.

20:12.888 --> 20:14.349
Some people are and some not.

20:15.671 --> 20:17.232
I don't know what it is.

20:17.292 --> 20:17.853
It's nature.

20:18.694 --> 20:22.978
But luckily, I was not the type that got seasick.

20:22.998 --> 20:24.480
And a lot of them did.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.441
They got sick.

20:25.761 --> 20:28.324
They didn't care what happened.

20:28.344 --> 20:30.306
They just felt so awful, you know.

20:31.062 --> 20:34.365
We told some Japs was coming up close.

20:34.926 --> 20:35.506
I don't care.

20:35.566 --> 20:36.567
I don't care what to do.

20:36.767 --> 20:37.248
I don't care.

20:39.770 --> 20:46.757
I know that the Birmingham, after it was attacked the third time with the suicide pilot, it was in desperate need of repair.

20:47.637 --> 20:53.823
And I believe it went to Guam first to get its hull repaired and then on to Pearl Harbor where it was there for three months.

20:54.764 --> 20:57.987
Yeah, we were there three months getting it fixed.

20:58.007 --> 20:58.868
Right.

20:58.888 --> 20:59.989
What did you do during that time?

21:00.627 --> 21:07.753
Well, we went to recreation places, one thing or another, just to get out of the way, you know.

21:08.274 --> 21:12.838
And they had places where you'd go and kind of be on vacation.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.281
And not on the ship or anything, but on the island.

21:17.182 --> 21:19.544
And that's where we went.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.126
We'd go to several different ones, you know.

21:22.246 --> 21:26.750
So you'd have a place to be and a place to wait for the ship.

21:27.771 --> 21:29.773
They didn't need all those guys on that ship.

21:30.192 --> 21:32.415
when we ended up in Pearl Harbor.

21:32.696 --> 21:33.938
Right, right.

21:35.320 --> 21:48.359
You told me though that it was during this time that the Birmingham got new orders when it was repaired, new orders to go back to Japan and fight a possible ground war.

21:48.479 --> 21:49.341
Talk about that.

21:49.861 --> 21:59.035
Well, they had already selected us when we got fixed up at Pearl Harbor to go to the Philippines

21:59.521 --> 22:01.203
have a big fleet rendezvous.

22:01.804 --> 22:07.150
They're going to invade the mainland of Japan, November the 1st, 1945.

22:08.451 --> 22:09.532
And we were part of it.

22:10.273 --> 22:12.276
And we had already been assigned.

22:13.016 --> 22:24.229
And luckily, Harry Truman ordered the atomic bomb dropped, and they convinced the Jeps that they better quit, and they surrendered.

22:25.130 --> 22:28.414
And then that canceled that invasion of Japan.

22:29.069 --> 22:33.096
And so, like I say, then they told us we were eligible to go home.

22:33.576 --> 22:36.301
Well, you could go home, and that's what I did.

22:37.383 --> 22:50.364
When I got the information about being eligible, I qualified, and I got permission to leave the ship, go over on Okinawa.

22:50.885 --> 22:55.853
It's like I told you, stay 10 days, and then we caught a troop ship.

22:56.086 --> 22:59.231
and we were a week getting home.

22:59.251 --> 23:09.246
So, it called a troop train from California to Norman, Oklahoma.

23:09.266 --> 23:10.909
That's where I was discharged.

23:10.929 --> 23:12.091
Right, right.

23:12.251 --> 23:13.172
Norman, Oklahoma.

23:14.254 --> 23:17.238
You were raised on a farm in Oklahoma.

23:17.799 --> 23:19.682
That's right.

23:19.722 --> 23:24.169
I had about 18 years on a farm before I got to Dallas.

23:24.723 --> 23:30.252
I lived in Dallas over 70 years.

23:30.272 --> 23:33.378
What did you do after you got out of the Navy?

23:33.898 --> 23:36.022
I learned a new business.

23:36.042 --> 23:37.484
I became an optician.

23:38.466 --> 23:45.878
That's in a workshop where they make the glasses, you see.

23:46.139 --> 23:47.441
Make the eyeglasses.

23:47.501 --> 23:48.583
I learned how to do that.

23:49.565 --> 23:50.967
And they called it optician.

23:52.229 --> 23:53.111
Was that in Dallas?

23:53.352 --> 23:54.514
Yeah, in Dallas, uh-huh.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.757
So you went back to Dallas?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.123
Yeah, I came back to Dallas, yeah.

23:58.484 --> 23:59.145
Right.

23:59.185 --> 24:00.528
When I got out of the Navy.

24:01.731 --> 24:01.992
Yeah.

24:03.355 --> 24:07.605
So I lived in Dallas, like I say, over 70 years.

24:08.851 --> 24:10.553
And now you're here in College Station.

24:11.254 --> 24:23.612
One thing we sort of referred to but didn't mention is that Eddie Thompson's niece is Sharon Colson, of course, the host of the show here on KAMU, and that's how I came to meet Eddie Thompson.

24:23.972 --> 24:30.741
Eddie, in the few minutes that we have left, I know that your wife, Betty, of 60 years, you were very, very close to her.

24:30.802 --> 24:31.963
She meant everything to you.

24:31.983 --> 24:33.666
You lost her in 1996.

24:33.766 --> 24:37.691
Talk about Betty Thompson.

24:37.711 --> 24:38.352
Talk about her?

24:38.450 --> 24:38.891
Yes, sir.

24:39.391 --> 24:41.174
Oh, she was a fine young lady.

24:41.194 --> 24:46.001
And she was 10 years younger than me.

24:47.323 --> 24:50.607
And the people asked me why I married one so much younger.

24:51.809 --> 24:53.932
And I said, well, she can take care of me longer.

24:55.434 --> 24:56.596
But it didn't work the other way.

24:56.956 --> 24:57.817
I took care of her.

24:59.260 --> 25:05.649
She got what they call pulmonary fibrosis, which attacks your lungs.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.052
And it took 10 years.

25:08.555 --> 25:12.639
before it caused her death.

25:14.040 --> 25:19.965
The doctors treated it in and out of hospitals, just all over the place, year after year.

25:21.486 --> 25:25.290
They're trying to learn how to cure this stuff.

25:25.950 --> 25:26.791
But they couldn't do it.

25:26.931 --> 25:29.313
It just kept getting worse.

25:29.333 --> 25:36.840
Fulmonary fibrosis, I don't know just what that is, except they told me that it attacks the lungs some way or another.

25:37.040 --> 26:02.811
you had 60 wonderful years together and i know that she was a very talented lady you showed me in your apartment the other day some of the the rug work that she had done that's right she liked making stuff you know by hand like rugs and one thing another and uh she did a whole lot of that she just did an awful lot of it well mr thompson we've just got uh about a minute or so left and uh

26:03.517 --> 26:06.220
I want to thank you very much for your service.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.842
What does it mean to you being a veteran of World War II?

26:09.022 --> 26:10.764
Well, I'm proud of it.

26:11.285 --> 26:15.849
I'm proud that I would say that I was a veteran of World War II.

26:16.370 --> 26:30.563
And they say that the World War II families, well, the generation of World War II generation did the greatest thing they've ever done for this country.

26:30.984 --> 26:33.186
They won World War II.

26:34.060 --> 26:43.296
And that's the greatest thing they've ever said that ever happened to this country was that the World War II victory went to us.

26:44.558 --> 26:46.661
And I actually think it's right, too.

26:47.503 --> 26:53.052
Well, indeed, you were part of the greatest generation, and I can't tell you what an honor it is to have you here on the show, and thank you very much.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.538
Well, I sure hope that I'm not boring you too much.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.922
Not at all, Mr. Thompson.

26:58.962 --> 26:59.443
Thank you.

27:00.166 --> 27:08.235
The USS Birmingham received nine battle stars for her World War II service and was retired to port in San Francisco in 1947.

27:09.016 --> 27:20.269
How fortunate we are to have heroes among us like Eddie Thompson, who can still recall with clarity and with pride those precious days of his youth that he gave in defense of our freedom.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.473
We salute Eddie Thompson for his service.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.808
Please, won't you thank a veteran today?

27:26.828 --> 27:27.710
Thanks for joining us.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.094
For Eddie Thompson, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:30.135 --> 27:42.880
Tune in next time for Veterans of the Valley.
