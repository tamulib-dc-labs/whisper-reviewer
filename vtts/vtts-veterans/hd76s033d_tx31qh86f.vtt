WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:29.498
has provided local decision-making and accessibility as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:29.917 --> 00:40.270
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.531 --> 00:42.393
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:42.413 --> 00:53.908
Bill Stroman has packed a lot of living into 80 years and a significant part of his journey was his tour of duty as an advisor for a Korean Marines unit during the Korean War.

00:53.928 --> 00:58.033
His action came in a four deuces unit, that's a 4.2 inch mortar launcher,

00:58.452 --> 01:05.924
Before and after, Bill Stroman attended three colleges, graduated, and spent most of his post-war career as a football coach.

01:06.505 --> 01:10.631
18 years over two different stints at Jurgenton High School near San Antonio.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.856
He also coached at Forestville, Humble, and Ganada.

01:14.417 --> 01:20.827
He's not an Aggie grad, but his sons are, and Bill and Nancy Stroman were named the Aggie Parents of the Year in 1980.

01:20.948 --> 01:26.316
It's a pleasure to welcome Colonel Bill Stroman, United States Marine Corps, to Veterans of the Valley.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.815
Bill, indeed, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:28.856 --> 01:36.145
I want to sort of take you from your youth at Eagle Pass, and I know your brothers and your brother-in-law were all in World War II.

01:36.265 --> 01:41.532
You graduated from high school about when World War II was ending, what you call the real war.

01:41.552 --> 01:45.637
Then you went off to college, your first of three colleges, and that sort of led you into the military.

01:45.677 --> 01:48.861
Sort of take us after high school into the military there.

01:49.516 --> 01:59.031
Well, I graduated in 1946, but the war ended basically in the summer of 1945.

01:59.732 --> 02:05.502
So I went off to college and ended up after a short stint at Texas Lutheran.

02:05.522 --> 02:08.166
I went out to sell Ross where I thought they were having more fun.

02:08.686 --> 02:18.799
And I saw a poster out there of a Marine Lieutenant in his dress blues, and it really did look like a great thing to be.

02:19.500 --> 02:24.886
And I told the guys at the student union there, I said, I'm going to go down there and check into that program.

02:24.906 --> 02:27.490
And they all said, well, that's pretty foolish, you know.

02:27.510 --> 02:34.879
But I went down there, and I joined the Marine Corps Reserve in the PLC program, which later on, I

02:36.665 --> 02:52.511
ended up after completing the first summer PLC I had to drop out of school for lack of funds and as a result I drifted away from that program and the Marine Corps didn't catch up with me until 1950, the summer of 1950 when all of a sudden they had something for us to do.

02:52.892 --> 02:54.014
Right, right.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.176
Now you went to three colleges.

02:55.196 --> 03:02.588
You started off at Texas Lutheran College in Seguin and then you hitchhiked to Sol Ross because you had a lot of friends there and they were having some fun, is that right?

03:02.568 --> 03:03.389
Well, that's correct.

03:03.489 --> 03:07.074
At Christmas time, they were telling me how booming things were out there.

03:07.134 --> 03:17.627
I'd played football that first year at Texas Lutheran and we had played Saul Ross and I thought, gee, I can play as well as these guys can, although they beat us.

03:17.647 --> 03:23.715
And when I got out there, they had just joined a new conference and I was ineligible for a full year.

03:24.296 --> 03:27.360
And by the time I was eligible, well, I had to

03:28.235 --> 03:53.803
drop out of school and but that's how I ended up there and then when I started back I ended up a friend of mine said this great school up at North Texas and I said I don't want to go to girls school and this happened to be a girl list friend and she said oh no there's a school across town from there in North Texas and I said well I'd go there if I could get in the next morning she called and said she had called up there and said I'd have no problem so

03:54.374 --> 03:56.696
I got out a map to look where Denton was.

03:56.716 --> 04:01.161
You know, when you're born and raised in Eagle Pass, you haven't been too far from home.

04:01.181 --> 04:01.701
Right.

04:01.981 --> 04:02.502
You're in Denton.

04:02.522 --> 04:04.344
You're a long way from Eagle Pass now.

04:04.424 --> 04:05.885
I had to find out where it was.

04:05.905 --> 04:09.789
You're still in Texas, but you're still a long way from Eagle Pass.

04:09.829 --> 04:11.991
It was a great place to be because you met Nancy there.

04:12.031 --> 04:18.397
She was a music student from the Northeast, and you met her, and you all were married in 1950.

04:18.517 --> 04:19.338
Is that right?

04:19.358 --> 04:19.959
That's correct.

04:20.119 --> 04:24.263
In June of 1950, we were on our way back from a honeymoon in

04:24.243 --> 04:29.126
New York City when the Korean War started.

04:29.467 --> 04:32.481
So we knew right then that our plans were

04:32.731 --> 04:57.152
on hold your honeymoon in new york city you you got off pretty pretty easy with the final bill i think you told me yes that's correct i found it this morning when we were when when i was digging around looking for pictures and whatnot and it was i had made an error it wasn't 27 it was three nights and it was 22.65 in new york city that's right yeah well you probably can't get a cup of coffee for that anymore right now

04:57.132 --> 04:57.753
That's right.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.856
You were coming home from your honeymoon.

05:00.876 --> 05:04.340
That's when Korea started, when you were coming back to Texas.

05:04.901 --> 05:12.289
And talk about sort of your entry into the Marine Corps, the boot camp, and before you first went overseas to Korea.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.992
Well, we had to wait around.

05:15.012 --> 05:23.161
I guess mainly because I had never been to boot camp was one of the reasons that it took a little longer to call me up.

05:23.521 --> 05:24.102
My brother

05:24.335 --> 05:31.191
had been in the Seabees, had stayed in the reserves, and every day he'd come home from the post office, and we'd say, well, do I have orders yet?

05:31.772 --> 05:35.782
And he'd say no, and so one day he came home, and he said, yes, we have orders, mine.

05:36.343 --> 05:39.390
And so he ended up...

05:39.725 --> 05:41.168
going back before I did.

05:41.528 --> 05:56.094
But I went to boot camp and in boot camp I was in the second recruit training battalion and it's kind of fortunate because they came out with an all more than anybody that had a college degree was eligible for a commissioning program.

05:56.675 --> 05:58.999
And the first battalion, which is pretty hard

05:59.435 --> 06:27.737
nose marine outfit that was a that was a regular recruit battalion right when you're not fighting right and so I got a chance to be interviewed and then when we got out of boot camp I went up to Pendleton and brought Nancy out to California and was out there and I heard one day some some guys were going somewhere for another screening for the same program I'd been in and so I went to see the first sergeant and he said yeah you look called around and checked around and whatnot and he said

06:27.970 --> 06:29.493
Yeah, you're supposed to be down there, too.

06:29.533 --> 06:34.223
So I went down there, and the lieutenant colonel and the major interviewed me, and that's the last I heard.

06:35.225 --> 06:43.522
We went on maneuvers then out to San Clemente Island, and Nancy had gone up to Northern California to spend some time up there with my aunt.

06:44.103 --> 06:47.650
And when we were out on San Clemente Island one day, the...

06:48.153 --> 06:53.358
a mail clerk came running over and said, hey, Stroman, Stroman, you're going to be, you're going to Quantico, you're going to be an officer.

06:53.418 --> 06:55.600
So I had to catch a mail plane back to Pendleton.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.483
And you brought Nancy down and said, hey, we're going cross country.

06:59.503 --> 07:05.709
We're in California and we've got to be in Quantico, Virginia, or you've got to be in Quantico, Virginia in a matter of days.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.171
So you took a train trip across country, right?

07:08.191 --> 07:08.892
That's correct.

07:09.792 --> 07:18.160
We were very fortunate because I was, I didn't know how we were going to get there because we didn't have a whole lot of money, but some good Marine sergeant that was going there,

07:18.140 --> 07:20.422
told me to go by private conveyance.

07:20.522 --> 07:22.284
And I said, I don't have private conveyance.

07:22.304 --> 07:23.165
And he said, that's all right.

07:23.185 --> 07:24.266
The Marine Corps doesn't know that.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.687
They're all advanced travel pay.

07:26.167 --> 07:29.590
So Nancy made a big old sack of tuna fish sandwiches.

07:29.610 --> 07:38.098
And my advanced travel pay was enough to get us a bus ticket to Los Angeles and a train ticket for both of us to New York City and me down to Quantico.

07:38.118 --> 07:39.039
And that's how we got there.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.122
You crossed the United States on $10 and a bag of tuna fish sandwiches.

07:42.142 --> 07:42.602
That's right.

07:42.622 --> 07:44.364
And had some change left over, I think, right?

07:44.484 --> 07:46.746
Probably did.

07:46.726 --> 08:01.453
Quantico, that's where you had your basic, I know, and you talked about how there were 500 of you that had college degrees at Quantico, and about 292 of you got your commission as second lieutenant, and you were one of those.

08:01.633 --> 08:02.194
That's correct.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.819
I was one of the 292 fortunate ones.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.642
Yeah, you were a little surprised at that, weren't you?

08:07.027 --> 08:08.550
Well, yeah, I was pretty dumb, you know.

08:08.570 --> 08:23.235
I hadn't been in the Marine Corps, in the real Marine Corps very long, and I was in company with Master Sergeants and Gunnery Sergeants that had fought World War II, so I felt like I didn't really know very much, which is the fact of the matter, I really didn't.

08:23.415 --> 08:28.444
You were commissioned May 29th of 1951, and your orders said, for duties beyond the seas.

08:28.524 --> 08:30.528
That means that you weren't staying stateside.

08:30.568 --> 08:32.050
You were going to Korea.

08:32.491 --> 08:33.152
That's correct.

08:33.132 --> 08:34.294
Right, right.

08:34.634 --> 08:36.337
You were okay with that, but Nancy wasn't.

08:36.577 --> 08:39.221
Nancy thought that she loved the Marine Corps up until that moment.

08:39.622 --> 08:43.427
When I came home with the duty beyond the seas, that was something.

08:43.447 --> 08:46.412
And we came home to Eagle Pass.

08:46.432 --> 08:50.418
We had a delay en route on our way to Pendleton in 14th replacement draft.

08:50.458 --> 08:55.225
And my brother had been in the 36th Infantry Division and made

08:55.829 --> 08:59.475
landings at Anzio, where else did they land?

08:59.915 --> 09:01.257
Southern France, all the way up.

09:02.018 --> 09:05.444
He said, he asked me what I was doing, and I told him, well, I'm going to Korea.

09:05.464 --> 09:07.246
And he said, well, what kind of job do you have there?

09:07.307 --> 09:10.632
And I popped out my chest and said, I'm going to be an infantry officer.

09:10.652 --> 09:12.935
And he said, you silly fools, you're going to get killed.

09:15.018 --> 09:17.382
You were ready to go to Korea, and that

09:17.851 --> 09:21.957
got delayed because they discovered that your outfit had no cold weather training.

09:21.977 --> 09:25.622
So you went to Pickle Meadows, California for the cold weather training.

09:25.662 --> 09:36.137
But eventually you got on a plane and you headed to Honolulu and then eventually to Korea to where everybody kept telling you, what are you all doing here?

09:36.157 --> 09:37.378
That's exactly right.

09:38.300 --> 09:42.145
They'd never seen that many lieutenants in one boat.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.787
Talk about the Korean War, Bill.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.491
A lot of people call it the Forgotten War.

09:46.876 --> 09:51.801
You sort of make fun of it and say World War II was the real war, as if you weren't in a real war.

09:51.861 --> 09:52.942
We know that that's not true.

09:53.723 --> 10:03.352
The Korean War, the Korean conflict, as some people call it, sort of talk about the war, educate us a little bit about sort of what your role was as a mortarman.

10:04.273 --> 10:10.079
And quite interesting, you were actually over in charge of an advisor to a unit of Korean Marines.

10:10.619 --> 10:12.581
So there was a language situation too.

10:12.641 --> 10:16.545
Just sort of talk about your duty in Korea as a Marine.

10:17.302 --> 10:32.414
When I got there, I guess because I didn't know a whole lot about anything and probably I'd get less people killed being over with the mortars and it would be leading a bunch of real Marines around.

10:33.977 --> 10:35.901
When I got there,

10:36.151 --> 10:42.380
1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment had been fighting with attachment to the 1st Marine Division.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.925
And they'd been fighting strictly just as an infantry unit with no support.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.809
All their support came from the Marine Corps.

10:49.350 --> 10:53.576
And they had just picked up the Four Deuce outfit.

10:53.596 --> 11:04.572
And when my boss sent me over there to them, they were back so far from the line that we couldn't even reach the, I don't think that our martyrs were

11:04.906 --> 11:27.488
would shoot far enough to to get over the hump on the thing so the first thing that uh that i did was suggest we move up a little closer and we did we moved up pretty close yes um i'm not sure they were that wild about moving up there but we certainly got there where we could where we could do damage to the enemy and uh um we uh as a matter of fact we uh

11:27.907 --> 11:32.954
Our first fire mission got us all off to a good start when we registered in up there.

11:32.994 --> 11:42.206
We were going to run a patrol that night out on a point that you'll show in the pictures a little later.

11:44.989 --> 11:49.335
We had a pretty good shoot because evidently we shot them up pretty good.

11:49.475 --> 11:55.703
We created some casualties out there on it and they sent an officer down there to this outpost to

11:55.683 --> 12:13.928
check on the on their casualties and that patrol went out that night and captured him right and so that made everybody happy and I gained a lot of stature right there I've always said that was my good start with the with the Marine Corps because you captured a

12:13.908 --> 12:14.951
an enemy officer.

12:14.971 --> 12:17.759
Nobody had an officer in a long time, you know.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.243
That's right.

12:19.283 --> 12:19.965
The four deuces.

12:19.985 --> 12:27.124
I know this is probably an outfit that you're very proud of and we're going to see some pictures about what a four deuces is a little bit in a minute, but

12:27.408 --> 12:30.873
Talk about that weapon and sort of how it worked.

12:31.173 --> 12:39.264
Well, you have one company of, at that time you had one company of four deuces supporting one regiment.

12:39.284 --> 12:41.827
That was the regimental commander's artillery, so to speak.

12:43.169 --> 12:54.023
He might have somebody else in 105 or 155 artillery that maybe was supporting him, was in a support role, but that was the regimental commander's artillery.

12:54.492 --> 12:55.915
It was pretty interesting.

12:55.955 --> 12:57.058
They did a lot of things.

12:57.078 --> 13:02.008
We had a lot of problems because they were doing it.

13:02.068 --> 13:08.502
We had a lot of problems with the base plates cracking because the ground was frozen and was so hard.

13:08.633 --> 13:14.224
Matter of fact, I had one good friend, Lieutenant Cusack, that got his purple heart because they set up a 4.2.

13:14.785 --> 13:18.092
He was with another regiment, with a Marine regiment, set up a 4.2.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.577
So we're on a mine, on a frozen mine.

13:20.597 --> 13:23.703
And I think about the 10th round, the mine went off.

13:23.723 --> 13:27.129
And then he got zapped with that, but not bad.

13:27.851 --> 13:29.955
Not bad enough to come home either.

13:30.175 --> 13:30.456
Right.

13:30.655 --> 13:38.631
When you're shooting at the enemy, obviously they're shooting back and you underplay somewhat the resistance or the danger that you were in.

13:38.671 --> 13:45.245
But obviously there was, because I know that at one time you lost count of the incoming, that so much of it was coming in.

13:45.265 --> 13:47.850
But I guess you look at it as your job.

13:47.890 --> 13:51.297
I asked you the other day if you were frightened and you said, sure, but you had a job to do.

13:51.749 --> 14:09.572
Well, that's true, and as an advisor to the four digits, I had to look after the forward observers that were all up with the battalions, so that took me up to their areas.

14:10.025 --> 14:16.677
We actually split our company a little later because we were stretched out.

14:16.697 --> 14:22.126
When we were on the East Coast, the 1st Korean Marine Regiment in the 1st Division, we hadn't so much territory.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.931
We strung out like a week's wash across there.

14:25.372 --> 14:30.902
We couldn't even traverse and support the entire regiment, so we had to split them and went over.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.160
Yeah, I moved around quite a bit with it.

14:33.180 --> 14:41.611
Christmas of 1951, you spent, you were in Korea, and then into 1952, and you were there until July of 1952, I believe is right.

14:41.651 --> 14:45.617
And that's when you left Korea and you came home.

14:45.637 --> 14:48.160
And we're going to talk about sort of your post-war career.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.385
We're going to talk about a football coaching around the state of Texas, all too.

14:51.405 --> 14:56.992
But right now, we've got some pictures that you all have, you've supplied us, that Bill and Nancy have supplied us.

14:57.033 --> 14:59.556
And we're going to go to those and let you talk about those.

14:59.536 --> 15:03.142
There is a young Marine, Bill Stroman, right there.

15:03.482 --> 15:04.484
When was this picture taken?

15:04.664 --> 15:05.406
How old were you?

15:05.786 --> 15:07.950
Well, I was 18, I guess.

15:09.252 --> 15:18.807
That was taken in 1947, shortly after I had joined, and I was on my tour at PLC at Quantico.

15:19.488 --> 15:20.690
Good-looking Marine right there.

15:21.832 --> 15:23.134
I love this picture.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.999
You grew a mustache.

15:26.249 --> 15:28.832
I like the hat, I like the stance, I like the mustache.

15:28.872 --> 15:31.014
You look like a real dude right there.

15:31.274 --> 15:34.177
You notice I got my 38 slung there on my right side.

15:34.217 --> 15:35.118
You can barely see it.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.622
And when was this taken and where?

15:38.782 --> 15:46.109
That was taken in 1951, in the winter of 1951 when I was with the KMC's.

15:46.129 --> 15:49.793
And that was when we were in the north lip of the Punchbowl right there.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.476
You can kind of get an idea of the terrain behind

15:52.912 --> 15:55.417
Why do I have a feeling that that picture is posed?

15:55.577 --> 15:59.183
Somebody said, Bill, I want you to look good here.

15:59.203 --> 16:02.489
Oh, probably as a matter of fact, I probably gave him the camera to take a picture of him.

16:02.610 --> 16:04.994
All right, let's move on.

16:05.314 --> 16:08.781
Okay, here's 4.2, one of the four deuces.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.424
Sort of talk about what we're looking at.

16:10.464 --> 16:15.072
This is similar to the weapon that you had, is that right?

16:15.338 --> 16:16.660
Yes, it's very similar.

16:16.740 --> 16:22.988
I think that the barrels may be a little longer, and of course, that one's sitting up on top of the deck, and ours were dug down.

16:23.008 --> 16:26.993
We had them dug in, so I'm just looking at it.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.497
My first thought, man, that thing's a long tube out there.

16:30.517 --> 16:31.579
It's a pretty simple thing.

16:31.599 --> 16:38.508
You just put the charges on that you want, and the FDC figures everything out, and you drop it in that top end of it.

16:38.528 --> 16:41.852
When it gets to the bottom, that hits the firing pin, and here it comes out again.

16:41.832 --> 16:43.834
and it's got a pretty good range.

16:43.854 --> 16:45.416
We've got another picture that I want to show.

16:45.436 --> 16:47.318
A little bit more modern day of the same weapon.

16:47.338 --> 16:49.660
This is an incredible picture that we found on the internet.

16:50.121 --> 16:55.446
You can actually see the shell leaving the muzzle in that picture.

16:57.488 --> 16:58.970
But that's the four deuces.

16:58.990 --> 16:59.810
Yes.

16:59.830 --> 17:00.331
Right there.

17:01.432 --> 17:01.712
Okay.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.155
What are we looking at here?

17:04.175 --> 17:07.378
Well, you're looking down from our lines right up on the ridge line.

17:07.498 --> 17:10.101
We were dug in right on the north lip of the

17:10.267 --> 17:14.016
of the punch bowl, and that's looking off into no man's land down there.

17:14.063 --> 17:19.869
And earlier I mentioned the place that we registered in the first time, and it's the very top center of the picture.

17:19.889 --> 17:32.322
You can just barely see a little bit of a knoll sitting in there, and that's where the enemy had an outpost out there that we raided that night and had the great success that made people think I knew what I was doing.

17:32.342 --> 17:37.728
That's a good representation of the terrain of Korea during the Korean War.

17:37.748 --> 17:39.630
Yes, that's looking almost straight down.

17:40.090 --> 17:40.270
Right.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.792
That looks cold.

17:41.772 --> 17:42.953
It was cold.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.475
That looks cold.

17:44.495 --> 17:55.429
Here's your unit in San Diego in 1951, and you are, if people can look, the second from the top row far right.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.932
That's Bell Stroman, second from the top row far right.

17:59.094 --> 18:01.557
That's your platoon unit there in San Diego.

18:01.597 --> 18:05.502
Okay, let's move on to the next picture.

18:09.110 --> 18:16.139
We're going to talk coming up about your career after your military service, and that means an awful lot of football coaching.

18:16.159 --> 18:24.929
And we mentioned in the outset about you being 18 years at Jourdenton, and that's you, the head football coach, and a couple of special football players flanking you.

18:24.949 --> 18:25.630
Who are they?

18:25.931 --> 18:29.996
Well, that's on the left-hand side, number 50 there is Bill.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.178
That's my oldest son.

18:32.238 --> 18:37.665
And on the other side, 53, Mark, my youngest son, who incidentally also became a Marine.

18:38.928 --> 18:43.755
May I say you look exactly like a football coach in that picture with the whistle and the coaching shorts.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.338
Here are your sons.

18:45.818 --> 18:48.422
This is Mark on the left and Bill on the right.

18:49.544 --> 18:50.746
This is a special occasion.

18:50.766 --> 18:51.907
Is this a wedding of some sort?

18:51.988 --> 18:53.089
Yes, it was a wedding, yes.

18:53.289 --> 18:53.670
Okay.

18:56.454 --> 18:57.235
And there's you and Mark.

18:57.616 --> 18:58.297
Talk about Mark.

18:58.337 --> 19:03.925
I know that he spent some time in the Marines as a mortarman also.

19:03.945 --> 19:04.586
Artilleryman.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.190
Artilleryman, excuse me, at Desert Storm.

19:07.230 --> 19:07.671
Is that right?

19:07.711 --> 19:08.412
That's correct.

19:09.505 --> 19:12.411
This was just prior to going to Desert Storm.

19:14.315 --> 19:21.931
We were living in Ghaneda at that time, and we thought we needed a father and son picture there, but we had that taken.

19:22.011 --> 19:25.078
That's a great picture.

19:25.098 --> 19:28.645
I think he's gained a little weight since then.

19:28.945 --> 19:34.253
And this is on a recent cruise, and I wanted people to see your lovely wife, Nancy.

19:34.273 --> 19:38.018
And there you are on one of your cruises.

19:38.038 --> 19:40.722
You all like to take cruises, and there you all are.

19:42.645 --> 19:43.586
Wonderful-looking couple.

19:43.606 --> 19:50.336
You were married in 1950, so you all are coming up here on, what, 58 years now?

19:50.957 --> 19:51.538
Next month.

19:51.598 --> 19:52.059
Next month.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.000
Right.

19:53.020 --> 19:53.541
There you go.

19:54.182 --> 19:55.003
Some great pictures.

19:55.388 --> 19:57.691
Okay, we're through with Korea and you come home.

19:58.071 --> 20:08.303
You stay in the Marines, in the reserves, you stay there, but you start your career in Texas as an educator and as a football coach like we just saw.

20:08.644 --> 20:09.084
That's correct.

20:09.124 --> 20:14.851
Sort of take us there because you had a few stops as a football coach and I guess it started in Floresville, is that right?

20:15.211 --> 20:20.818
Yes, that was my first coaching job in Floresville and was a pretty good experience.

20:20.898 --> 20:25.243
I worked under a really fine head coach there, a guy by the name of Ralph Starnes,

20:25.814 --> 20:28.116
He didn't live to be a real old man.

20:28.156 --> 20:30.018
He also was a Marine, come to think of it.

20:32.100 --> 20:40.127
He taught me an awful lot, but I was there two years, and I got the head coaching job at Jourdenden, which I was still pretty young to have that job.

20:40.487 --> 20:48.675
The president of the school board asked me, said, when I was interviewed, he asked me, he said, do you think you can beat Pleasanton?

20:48.695 --> 20:49.756
And I said, yes, sir.

20:50.637 --> 20:52.018
Shortly thereafter, they said, you're hired.

20:53.159 --> 20:55.281
And we beat him.

20:55.582 --> 20:58.647
You were at Jurgenton for a short stint, I believe four years.

20:58.727 --> 20:58.988
Yes, sir.

20:59.108 --> 21:05.158
And then you decided to leave coaching for a while and determined pretty quickly that that was a mistake.

21:05.178 --> 21:07.182
You missed coaching and you wanted to get back in.

21:07.202 --> 21:12.872
So sort of talk about that between time from Jurgenton the first stint and Jurgenton the second stint.

21:12.892 --> 21:17.860
Well, we were, it was pretty tough to make a living teaching in those days, I think.

21:18.245 --> 21:25.191
If you were ill, you had to pay your own sub, which wasn't very costly, $5 a day for a sub.

21:25.211 --> 21:27.278
And we had no hospitalization.

21:27.338 --> 21:30.229
And by that time, we'd had a couple of kiddos.

21:30.766 --> 21:32.488
It was a real concern.

21:32.588 --> 21:35.011
And so we'd had a pretty good year in 58.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.433
We didn't get beat to the state semifinals.

21:37.734 --> 21:40.177
So I thought, well, it's a pretty good time to try something else.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.800
And I had some friends, and they offered me some various things.

21:42.860 --> 21:47.024
And so I did some other things during that time in real life.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.686
I always call that the real life.

21:48.966 --> 21:55.314
Then in 1965, we got our feet on the ground.

21:55.394 --> 21:58.377
Nancy had her degree.

21:58.964 --> 22:26.490
we had an opportunity to go back to Jordan and so we did and we were able to go back to what we really like to do and I think that was a good time in my life and I need to say this because to me it solidified what I was doing with kids because I had had a good job and I'd made good money and during that when I went back to coaching and teaching

22:26.622 --> 22:35.514
I knew that I did it because that's what I truly loved to do and not something that maybe I just happened to fall into or something that's the only thing I could do.

22:36.296 --> 22:40.381
And I always thought maybe that's all of our teachers ought to be like that.

22:41.062 --> 22:45.689
If they're not teaching because it's the greatest thing in the world to do, then they ought to not be doing it.

22:46.370 --> 22:53.760
1965, you mentioned you went back to Jordan and this time you spent 14 years there as the coach.

22:54.230 --> 22:58.235
And then after that time, you were, as you say, you were reassigned.

22:58.555 --> 23:00.297
Somebody thought you couldn't coach football anymore.

23:00.317 --> 23:04.603
Well, it took them a while to find out I didn't know how to coach football, and so I was reassigned.

23:04.723 --> 23:11.130
But you developed a love of track, and you became a track coach then, which you later became a track coach at Hummel High School, too.

23:11.311 --> 23:11.851
Well, yes.

23:12.012 --> 23:21.503
I've got a good background starting in track at Floresville because that coach really believed that kids ought to run, and it was a good thing, and I liked it.

23:21.483 --> 23:29.164
It took me a long time to really learn how to coach track, but I think that when I finished up, I could coach it pretty well, even to this day.

23:29.549 --> 23:36.580
You and Nancy didn't get to the Brazos Valley permanently until 2001, but you almost got here a lot earlier.

23:36.620 --> 23:48.359
Talk about your interview with Merrill Green, and you almost became a part of the athletic of the Bryan ISD, but two phone calls came within a few minutes of each other, right?

23:48.439 --> 23:49.140
That's correct.

23:50.122 --> 23:57.413
My oldest son knew I was looking, and he had mentioned he had run into Merrill Green

23:57.983 --> 23:59.624
They were pouring concrete or something.

23:59.685 --> 24:03.668
And Merle Green said, well, you know, you need to get your daddy to give me a call.

24:03.688 --> 24:09.373
He said, because any young man that talks that well about his father, I'd like to meet.

24:09.473 --> 24:15.599
And so I got an interview with him and came up and explained what I was looking for in the middle school type thing.

24:15.679 --> 24:17.341
And he thought that was pretty good.

24:17.361 --> 24:18.562
He said, we don't have that opening.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.623
He said, but it sounds good.

24:19.643 --> 24:21.565
And he said, I'll see what I can figure out.

24:21.985 --> 24:25.408
In the meantime, I took the job.

24:25.777 --> 24:28.460
or I had interviewed down in the Houston area.

24:29.121 --> 24:33.106
And I picked up the phone and I had called Sam Mosley.

24:34.267 --> 24:37.351
Most folks around here remember Sam or at least they remember Mike.

24:38.412 --> 24:40.295
His dad was the AD at Humble.

24:41.216 --> 24:44.180
And I told him, I said, I'll take the job.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.525
I hung up the phone and I walked about five steps and the phone rang and it was Merle on the phone.

24:48.545 --> 24:49.746
He said, I've got it all worked out.

24:49.766 --> 24:50.427
You can come here.

24:50.447 --> 24:54.332
And I said, man, I'd love to come there, but I've already taken a job at Humble.

24:54.548 --> 24:55.890
So it took us a little longer to get here.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.855
You were in Humble for three years and middle school athletic coordinator.

24:59.875 --> 25:00.316
Two years.

25:00.536 --> 25:01.197
Two years there.

25:01.517 --> 25:01.738
Right.

25:02.018 --> 25:04.241
And then as a track coach.

25:04.301 --> 25:06.144
And then Nancy said, move me to the country.

25:06.804 --> 25:11.350
And so you all went to Ganada, which is down Highway 59 south of Houston.

25:11.391 --> 25:14.595
I guess sort of halfway between Houston and Victoria, I guess it is.

25:14.715 --> 25:17.218
And you all spent some time down there.

25:17.278 --> 25:21.124
You coached, you were actually an assistant football coach for a couple of years there, right?

25:21.544 --> 25:24.488
I coached the backs and the linebackers for Tom Jones, who...

25:24.468 --> 25:27.334
I had the head job, and we enjoyed it.

25:27.374 --> 25:33.306
We coached two years, then I had one year I just taught, and then they made me an elementary principal, and I really enjoyed it.

25:33.546 --> 25:41.582
We're almost out of time, but I want you to tell people what the superintendent of Ganada told you when you told them that you all needed computers at the school.

25:41.602 --> 25:43.726
I ought to not pick on Frank like that.

25:43.766 --> 25:44.468
It's a funny story.

25:44.488 --> 25:46.071
I went in and I told him.

25:46.051 --> 25:49.697
I went in there and told him, I said, Frank, we've got to get computers in this school.

25:49.957 --> 25:51.560
And he looked at me and said, oh, heck, coach.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.065
He says, I've already bought them overhead projectors.

25:55.085 --> 25:59.031
So that's how far we were from that.

25:59.472 --> 26:02.437
You were trying to drag him kicking and screaming into the 20th century, right?

26:02.457 --> 26:02.878
And we did.

26:03.258 --> 26:03.899
And we did.

26:03.919 --> 26:05.161
And you finally did.

26:05.181 --> 26:08.947
We saw pictures of Billy and Mark, and I know that they are proud Aggies.

26:09.127 --> 26:12.092
And you all became even prouder in 1980.

26:12.308 --> 26:14.852
when you and Nancy became the Aggie Parents of the Year.

26:16.114 --> 26:17.055
Talk about your sons.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.417
We've got about a minute left.

26:18.477 --> 26:23.766
And sort of, even though you're not an Aggie as far as a grad, I know that you feel like one.

26:23.786 --> 26:24.587
Oh, I think we are.

26:24.807 --> 26:25.028
Right.

26:25.649 --> 26:37.827
Well, I was so pleased with the way things turned out for my kiddos going to A&M, of course, that I tried to encourage a lot of other kids that I taught to go there.

26:38.108 --> 26:40.932
I either tried to talk them into going there or the Marine Corps.

26:41.468 --> 26:43.010
if they were pretty good kids.

26:44.192 --> 26:54.906
So it all worked out really good doing that, and we have missed a home football game one or two since 1973, so that's pretty good.

26:55.526 --> 27:03.237
It's great to have you here, and we are out of time, but thank you to you and to Nancy for your service and being great members of this community.

27:03.737 --> 27:04.658
We enjoyed it very much.

27:04.759 --> 27:06.401
We enjoy living here, too.

27:06.421 --> 27:07.442
Thank you, Bill.

27:07.422 --> 27:12.431
As you can see, Bill Stroman's service has gone far beyond his service in uniform.

27:12.591 --> 27:21.967
As a coach and teacher, his influence on young people over the years has surely been handed down from those kids to their kids to their kids and will continue.

27:22.127 --> 27:24.792
We salute Colonel Bill Stroman for his Marine service.

27:25.313 --> 27:26.274
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:26.415 --> 27:28.418
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:09.860 --> 28:20.693
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

28:20.713 --> 28:30.906
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.
