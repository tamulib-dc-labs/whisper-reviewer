Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.278 --> 00:33.379
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:33.899 --> 00:46.593
Chuck Sipial has been a significant part of Texas A&M's administrative family for some 15 years as vice president for administration, more recently in charge of facilities where he now works for the A&M system.

00:47.194 --> 00:53.401
The story you may not know is that of Colonel Chuck Sipial, United States Air Force officer for 22 years.

00:53.941 --> 01:00.008
It was a fascinating career that included a nine-month tour at Pleiku Air Base during the Vietnam War.

01:00.173 --> 01:07.121
Also, two tours in Europe, first at Madrid, Spain, and then later at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

01:07.141 --> 01:17.153
He served several stateside tours where his expertise and education as a civil engineer paved a path to both his military and civilian careers.

01:17.173 --> 01:20.117
Colonel Charles A. Chuck Sipiel Sr.

01:20.317 --> 01:22.620
is our guest today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:23.056 --> 01:25.979
Chuck, it's an honor to have you, honor to finally have you here.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.441
I've wanted to have you on the show for a long time.

01:28.461 --> 01:31.403
Let's go back to when you were born in Montgomery, Alabama in 1944.

01:31.684 --> 01:38.610
You and your family, your siblings, 11 of you, and mom and dad, you lived a little bit outside of Montgomery on a farm.

01:38.870 --> 01:43.594
You grew food and sort of talk about growing up at that time in Montgomery, Alabama.

01:44.274 --> 01:46.116
Well, thank you very much for having me here, Tom.

01:46.196 --> 01:48.558
I've been waiting too to come on the show.

01:48.618 --> 01:51.801
I think it's a very, very, it's an excellent show.

01:51.901 --> 01:52.962
Thank you.

01:53.701 --> 01:56.084
I grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, as you just stated.

01:56.384 --> 02:02.070
We lived out what we refer to as the country back in those days, seven miles out of the city.

02:02.971 --> 02:11.480
We had an 18-acre farm that we grew vegetables and corn and all kinds of things for the family to exist on.

02:11.580 --> 02:18.147
We also had cows and pigs, and we had a horse that we used to work the farm.

02:18.347 --> 02:23.573
And when we were old enough to go out and work in the garden, that's what we would

02:23.890 --> 02:25.332
we would be assigned to do.

02:26.413 --> 02:32.421
We were old enough to feed the chickens in the morning and the hogs in the evening when we came from school.

02:32.482 --> 02:33.363
That's what we did.

02:33.423 --> 02:35.666
And we did that until age 11.

02:36.126 --> 02:42.455
And at age 11, Dad then would take us out with him to learn how to become electricians.

02:42.695 --> 02:52.168
We were kind of the guys who did all the hard work, all the dirty work, crawling underneath houses and attics and stringing wires and stuff.

02:52.749 --> 02:53.610
And that

02:54.282 --> 03:06.140
continued until we were age 16 and were old enough to get our driver's license, and then he started developing us to be crew leaders working for him and having a crew of two or three and wiring houses.

03:06.221 --> 03:22.045
We wired thousands and thousands of houses over our careers working for Dad, and we worked for Dad until we were able to go to college, but Dad was pretty smart because he sent us to college either at, in Montgomery,

03:22.328 --> 03:26.013
or in Tuskegee, which is 30 minutes away.

03:26.033 --> 03:30.740
So in either case, when we were not in class, we were working with the business.

03:31.882 --> 03:37.369
Dad was a very successful contractor in that he was able to send all 11 of us to college.

03:38.451 --> 03:45.260
And most of us stayed in Dad's career area in construction.

03:45.701 --> 03:48.525
A couple like my older brother and myself, we ventured out.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.289
Dad's response was, you can

03:51.674 --> 03:55.697
do whatever you want to do after you become a German electrician.

03:55.717 --> 03:59.237
And at age 18, all the boys were German electricians.

03:59.453 --> 04:04.900
and all the girls worked in the office and became office administrative people.

04:05.300 --> 04:12.890
That's a fascinating story because you said that your dad was one of the first, if not the first, African-American electricians in the state of Alabama.

04:12.910 --> 04:13.471
Yes, he was.

04:13.691 --> 04:18.638
And rewind a little bit to your pre-college schooling.

04:19.138 --> 04:20.640
You went to a three-room schoolhouse.

04:22.442 --> 04:22.843
Yes.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.465
Three teachers.

04:24.901 --> 04:33.553
What you were taught, you were taught to read and write, and as you stated to me earlier, pretty much just how to survive in the African-American community, right?

04:33.573 --> 04:34.555
Well, that is correct.

04:35.516 --> 04:43.487
Our school in our neighborhood was, as you indicated, a three-room school and three teachers, including the principal.

04:44.469 --> 04:46.251
Each teacher had two grades.

04:46.231 --> 04:50.577
A lot of times the teachers spend a lot of time trying to keep control of the class.

04:50.717 --> 04:53.261
I was one of the bad guys, I hate to say, but I was.

04:53.842 --> 05:12.087
But it was one of the schools that did teach you how to read and write and to exist in the African-American community because the whole system was based on you staying in Montgomery, living in that community, and being able to find a job of some sort.

05:13.518 --> 05:21.942
And as I said, my father's desire was that we become electricians because his thought was that

05:22.377 --> 05:23.879
People will always need lights.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.782
And as long as they need lights, they need electricians.

05:27.222 --> 05:30.005
So you could always be able to take care of yourself.

05:30.025 --> 05:30.546
Exactly.

05:31.647 --> 05:32.688
There were 11 of you.

05:33.129 --> 05:35.531
Like you said, all 11 of you went to college.

05:35.551 --> 05:37.233
Eight of you graduated.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.495
Some went to Alabama State.

05:38.815 --> 05:43.320
Others, like yourself, went to Tuskegee University, as we were discussing just a moment ago.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.845
Of course, the home of the very famous World War II squadron, the Tuskegee Airmen.

05:48.128 --> 05:50.311
You graduated in May of 67.

05:50.691 --> 05:51.673
You were married in June.

05:51.733 --> 05:59.403
You went into the Air Force in July and you were sent off to Madrid, Spain from Tuskegee, Alabama to Madrid, Spain.

05:59.423 --> 06:00.965
That was quite a culture shock.

06:00.985 --> 06:01.827
What an experience.

06:02.187 --> 06:02.287
Yeah.

06:02.367 --> 06:03.088
What an experience.

06:03.128 --> 06:13.883
Two people who barely had ever left the state of Alabama graduated from college and find themselves in a few months in the middle of downtown Madrid, Spain in a

06:14.437 --> 06:21.723
a penthouse apartment, no Spanish capability, and starting out on an adventure.

06:22.404 --> 06:24.165
That continued.

06:24.265 --> 06:33.674
We moved, finally found a place to move, to live in, and then within 11 months, we had our first child, and then 18 months later, we had our second child.

06:34.114 --> 06:41.040
And when you were there, you immediately took your training as a civil engineer to work there in Spain as a civil engineering program officer.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.482
Talk a little bit about what your duty was in Madrid.

06:43.883 --> 06:50.078
Well, my primary duty was to program projects that the base needed to have accomplished.

06:50.640 --> 06:57.156
I was on the programming end, the starting of the end, to submit the paperwork to the headquarters for the projects to get approved.

06:58.258 --> 07:00.103
After that stint,

07:00.320 --> 07:07.469
I was then moved to the engineering side of the house where I was able to supervise the design engineers.

07:07.490 --> 07:24.772
So from the program aspect, we went from there to the design aspect to get the projects designed and advertised and work with Spanish contractors, which was an experience in itself, not speaking very much Spanish and dealing with them and trying to get projects moved along.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.715
They were not as ambitious

07:26.695 --> 07:28.799
in moving those projects along as we were.

07:28.839 --> 07:39.036
So that was always a conversation or two with them, trying to encourage them and convince them that we needed the project today, not maÃ±ana.

07:39.056 --> 07:41.220
You were in Madrid for four years.

07:41.501 --> 07:45.227
Before you ever left, though, a buddy came up to you and had a suggestion for you.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.062
Talk about what that suggestion was.

07:47.122 --> 07:53.670
Yeah, my buddy Greg, Jim Greg, was a single guy, very kind of wild guy.

07:54.231 --> 07:55.273
We got along great.

07:55.373 --> 07:55.953
I was married.

07:56.013 --> 07:56.654
He was single.

07:57.075 --> 07:59.939
He would come and spend time at my house, spend the night.

08:00.639 --> 08:02.141
And so we got to be very good friends.

08:02.202 --> 08:05.646
And one day he suggested that we go to Vietnam.

08:05.626 --> 08:07.329
Volunteer.

08:07.509 --> 08:09.152
Volunteer to go to Vietnam.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.055
And I said, Jim, why?

08:11.115 --> 08:16.084
He says, hey, we can go work in that Red Horse squadron, that heavy equipment squadron, get a lot of experience.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.226
Those guys have a lot of fun.

08:17.286 --> 08:20.712
I have a friend who's over there, and he's just having a ball.

08:20.732 --> 08:22.395
So let's go volunteer.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.737
It was a construction unit.

08:24.358 --> 08:24.739
Yes, it was.

08:24.759 --> 08:26.642
The Air Force version of the Navy Seabees.

08:26.823 --> 08:27.884
Exactly.

08:27.904 --> 08:31.110
So Jim and I go trucking down to...

08:31.546 --> 08:36.732
personnel and say, we want to volunteer to go to Vietnam and we want to be in the heavy construction unit.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.416
And they said, oh yeah, we need people to do that.

08:39.756 --> 08:44.442
And so we both volunteered, but neither one of us got into the heavy construction unit.

08:44.903 --> 08:54.094
They sent Jim to the headquarters in Saigon and sent me to Pleiku Air Base in the central highlands with the mountain yards and mostly army

08:54.074 --> 08:58.558
guys at two core headquarters, so that's where I spent my time.

08:58.918 --> 09:01.961
September of 1971, that's when you went in country.

09:02.421 --> 09:05.404
Talk more about that duty and what it involved.

09:05.424 --> 09:11.329
You were sort of in charge of the base there as far as its maintenance and sort of its operation, right?

09:11.349 --> 09:11.849
That is correct.

09:11.949 --> 09:18.795
I was the operations and maintenance, also what we refer to as the station civil engineer.

09:19.636 --> 09:23.119
I was responsible for maintaining the buildings that

09:23.437 --> 09:31.508
the Air Force used, as well as converting and turning over buildings to the Vietnamese Air Force.

09:33.310 --> 09:44.364
Part of that program that the military had at the time was that we were turning functions over to the Vietnamese so that we could withdraw from Vietnam.

09:44.384 --> 09:53.376
And that was my job, turning those buildings over one by one in perfect shape to the South Vietnamese Air Force

09:53.963 --> 09:56.527
engineers so they could maintain them.

09:56.547 --> 09:57.268
Right.

09:57.288 --> 10:02.135
This was not a dangerous tour, obviously, because they were going to talk about that.

10:02.275 --> 10:03.557
No, it was.

10:04.178 --> 10:06.461
It had its at-batch points.

10:07.082 --> 10:18.018
We were on the bottom side of the hill from Tukor headquarters, and the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese would shoot rockets at Tukor headquarters, and they would miss.

10:18.158 --> 10:20.241
We would say they had that three-level

10:20.221 --> 10:24.730
trainees up there shooting rockets at them and they would come down in our part of that base

10:25.081 --> 10:32.328
And I remember one morning I was at work around 6.15 and all of a sudden this big loud noise and everything happens.

10:32.428 --> 10:36.592
And after you're there for a while, there are instincts that take over.

10:36.632 --> 10:40.836
And before I know it, I was under my desk with my helmet on, with my flank jacket on.

10:41.557 --> 10:49.304
But I learned a lot from that, not to go to work that early by myself in that part of the base in the morning.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.126
So we got shot at quite a bit.

10:51.326 --> 10:53.468
And as the war progressed and as

10:54.140 --> 10:59.527
In 7 to 2, we were being shot at every morning around 5 o'clock.

11:00.349 --> 11:06.657
They would launch about 15 or 20 rockets at us, and thank God they didn't hit the trailers where we were staying at the time.

11:07.278 --> 11:11.985
So those were some scary moments for many of us Air Force people over there.

11:12.225 --> 11:22.459
Among your medals and decorations that you received, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal,

11:22.642 --> 11:25.365
with four Oakleaf clusters.

11:25.966 --> 11:29.610
Now, later on in this nine-month tour, sort of your duty changed.

11:29.650 --> 11:36.398
Talk a little bit about that, how that involved as far as navigation of airplanes and such that a little bit outside of Pleiku.

11:37.259 --> 11:51.636
Well, when we originally were assigned to this unit was there, we had what we refer to as attack hand site up in the tri-border area.

11:51.970 --> 11:55.054
Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and South Vietnam.

11:55.195 --> 12:04.728
And we had two airmen who maintained this site and maintained the generators in order to provide power for the site.

12:04.768 --> 12:07.452
And it was up in the triple canopy jungle.

12:07.472 --> 12:10.857
And I would have to go up there occasionally to check on them.

12:10.877 --> 12:12.539
They stayed overnight there.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.143
We would occasionally rotate them out.

12:15.163 --> 12:18.368
But as the war progressed, we would bring them out every night.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.070
And unfortunately,

12:20.438 --> 12:26.125
The last day they were scheduled to go, there was a lot of firefighting going on up in that area.

12:26.806 --> 12:33.695
They were dropped off, but the army crew, the helicopter crew that went up there was shot down and all people were killed.

12:33.735 --> 12:36.399
And that was a sad day for all of us.

12:37.520 --> 12:46.632
And the Vietnamese men were moving down south and again started shooting at us on a more regular basis and a more consistent basis.

12:47.033 --> 12:58.974
Because of the acceleration of the transfer of the base to the South Vietnamese Air Force, you got to come home from rather than the typical 12-month tour, you got to come home three months early.

12:58.994 --> 13:02.019
So you spent nine months when you did come home.

13:02.039 --> 13:07.929
I want to go to some photographs right now, and then we'll come back and talk about your post-Vietnam service because there's a lot to talk about there.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.273
A few pictures that...

13:10.253 --> 13:11.515
When was it?

13:11.535 --> 13:13.157
This was taken in at Pleiku, is that right?

13:13.177 --> 13:14.319
This was at Pleiku.

13:14.339 --> 13:19.107
That was our uniform for the day, and I think that was probably about half of my tour there.

13:19.167 --> 13:23.954
I was out with probably the security police.

13:24.575 --> 13:35.772
The security police captain there had become one of my best friends, and we would do all kinds of crazy things like patrol the perimeter at night when we thought the big con would be coming by.

13:35.752 --> 13:40.238
It was just young men thinking that we could do a lot.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.103
So that was one of the times that we were there.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.527
I asked you about the size of the Pleiku Air Base.

13:46.547 --> 13:52.775
You likened it a little bit to about the size of Easterwood Field in College Station, but obviously a lot more buildings.

13:52.795 --> 13:56.460
This is an aerial shot taken in 1969.

13:56.812 --> 13:58.614
quite a bit the way it looked like when you were there.

13:59.175 --> 14:03.521
It certainly was, and if you look to the top of the picture, you will see the runway.

14:04.382 --> 14:21.165
As we were pulling out and moving equipment back, one of the projects I had to do was to install a different kind of barrier system there for the Vietnamese Air Force A1Es that would land there and take off there.

14:21.145 --> 14:26.473
I remember working out on that runway and the planes coming in.

14:26.573 --> 14:30.580
Some of them were shot up and we would have to evacuate the area for a while.

14:30.600 --> 14:35.627
Then we would go back and run back out over there again and try to finish our project.

14:35.647 --> 14:37.110
That has some memories.

14:37.891 --> 14:39.814
Let's move on to a few other pictures.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.837
You're about to get into a trainer, right?

14:42.087 --> 14:47.458
Yes, this was when I was at Williams Air Force Base.

14:47.538 --> 14:51.325
My commander and I were pretty close.

14:51.345 --> 14:57.177
I was the base engineer, squad commander, and he was the wing commander.

14:57.157 --> 15:12.786
he would always say that as a maintenance officer I had all the money and he couldn't get any and and so he would he promised me he would take me for a ride on the T-38 trainer which he did and he did all kind of supersonic

15:12.766 --> 15:16.851
I want to see how quickly he'd get you to throw up, right?

15:16.871 --> 15:24.341
And he did, he did, and he laughed about it and told the whole wing about that Chuck Smith threw up.

15:24.401 --> 15:29.808
The funny thing, I hadn't eaten for a day trying to make sure he didn't.

15:29.828 --> 15:33.292
But that was an enjoyable... This was before the flight and you had a smile on your face.

15:33.312 --> 15:33.913
Yes, I did.

15:34.073 --> 15:34.934
Right, right.

15:35.155 --> 15:37.137
The smile wasn't quite that big afterwards.

15:37.117 --> 15:37.959
Where's this?

15:38.159 --> 15:39.903
This was later on.

15:40.123 --> 15:41.105
Later on at Williams.

15:41.466 --> 15:43.390
We had a change of command ceremony.

15:45.274 --> 15:53.792
There was a request that went out to all the lieutenant colonels to volunteer to be the commander

15:53.772 --> 16:02.127
The officer in charge for that particular occasion, I held my hand first, and the wing commander says, okay, you got it.

16:02.367 --> 16:09.499
And so I was in charge of the change of command on that particular day.

16:09.860 --> 16:13.266
That was when I was a little smaller and a lot more in better shape.

16:13.634 --> 16:16.359
Now this was, I guess, was this in Arizona also?

16:16.379 --> 16:17.621
This was also at Williams.

16:18.222 --> 16:21.407
This was in the golf pro shop.

16:21.427 --> 16:27.497
As you see from the badge, I was also the base fire marshal there at Williams Air Force Base.

16:28.459 --> 16:31.845
But I was, my boss also liked to play golf.

16:31.865 --> 16:37.414
And so we were then shopping, probably meeting one of the

16:37.715 --> 16:47.232
visitors that we would have in the winter time coming from Washington area to review the base and get a little game of golf in at the same time.

16:47.813 --> 16:50.758
This is post-Vietnam, which we'll be talking about here in just a little bit.

16:51.479 --> 16:54.424
And here's a couple of accommodations.

16:54.573 --> 17:06.412
I had completed by seminar the Air Command and Staff College, and I was presented my certificate by one of the colonels over at Maxwell Air Force Base there.

17:07.133 --> 17:10.118
Okay, and then another certificate.

17:10.621 --> 17:21.901
This is when the other gentleman, our other major and I completed our Air War College by seminar and I was really happy about that.

17:21.982 --> 17:29.355
We both were distinguished graduates of the seminar and we're very pleased and that was our wing commander giving us our certificates.

17:30.027 --> 17:32.892
And finally, I think we have your official Air Force photograph there.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.800
Yeah, that was me when I had black hair.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.523
It's all gray now.

17:39.044 --> 17:40.667
Towards the end of your service, I take it.

17:40.767 --> 17:41.329
Yes, it was.

17:41.469 --> 17:52.069
I had completed the Industrial College of Armed Forces and Residents, and this was when I was being signed to the Pentagon.

17:53.315 --> 17:55.660
So we got a lot to talk about post-Vietnam, obviously.

17:55.700 --> 18:01.271
When you came back from Vietnam, you told me that your first plan was to get out and go back to work for your dad.

18:01.772 --> 18:05.540
But then your family got together and said, hey, we don't want to go back to Alabama.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.903
Do you not like what you're doing?

18:06.943 --> 18:08.306
And you said, sure, I like it.

18:08.366 --> 18:09.328
So you stayed in.

18:09.348 --> 18:14.158
My five-year-old son, well, the wife and the two kids,

18:14.375 --> 18:29.050
at the time, and I was sitting at the table, and we had about three or four weeks to go in the service, and so I was just commenting, well, we're getting out of the Air Force pretty soon, and my oldest son Anthony said, Dad, why are we getting out?

18:29.150 --> 18:34.235
I like the Air Force, and my wife commented, yeah, I do too, so we don't want to go back to Alabama.

18:34.816 --> 18:40.281
We don't want to go back and work with their, you know, they didn't really want me to go back and work for Dad, because

18:40.598 --> 18:47.607
They'd enjoyed the traveling around and they knew dad was a pretty tough taskmaster as he was when we were growing up.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.693
So they suggested that we stay in.

18:52.474 --> 19:01.105
And fortunately for me, I had been given a real fantastic opportunity

19:01.540 --> 19:10.592
commander to work for, I shouldn't say I had been given, he was assigned to the base and we hit it off real well.

19:10.612 --> 19:12.294
Colonel Dan Taylor.

19:12.314 --> 19:14.077
Colonel Dan Taylor.

19:14.097 --> 19:21.987
And Colonel Taylor and I hit it off and I went to tell him that I really didn't want to get out, my family and I really liked it.

19:22.007 --> 19:27.835
And so he hand carried the paperwork through and within two weeks time I was back in the service

19:28.270 --> 19:31.395
headed now for a real serious career.

19:33.899 --> 19:38.827
First off, Andrews Air Force Base, where you were an assistant director of construction management.

19:39.488 --> 19:45.378
Within less than a year, you were asked to be the chief of operations, still at Andrews, with 400 people under your command.

19:45.398 --> 19:47.842
Yes, that was a tremendous assignment.

19:47.862 --> 19:54.413
I went to Colonel Taylor and I said to Colonel Taylor, you know, I had a crew when I was 16.

19:54.646 --> 20:02.895
And I think I know how to manage and lead people, and I'd like to have the opportunity to fill this position until the permanent replacement gets in.

20:03.075 --> 20:05.237
And he said, you sure you can do it?

20:05.297 --> 20:07.900
And I convinced him that I could.

20:08.661 --> 20:15.568
And so six months later, when the permanent person came in, he said, you're doing such a great job, I'm going to keep you in the job.

20:16.409 --> 20:18.251
And the new guy got your old job, right?

20:18.271 --> 20:19.793
The new guy got my old job.

20:19.773 --> 20:28.301
You were sent for your second tour in Europe, this time to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

20:28.321 --> 20:28.902
Talk about there.

20:28.922 --> 20:30.464
You were there for eight months.

20:30.784 --> 20:32.866
I was there after eight months.

20:33.647 --> 20:47.080
I had gone up and volunteered to the executive officer for the civil engineer for a year to sit in his seat if he wanted to go on leave or had something to do because I wanted to learn more about the Air Force in Europe.

20:47.752 --> 20:53.205
And somehow that information got communicated to the chief

20:53.270 --> 21:06.928
And so when this individual first decided to take some leave, they asked me up and I went up for a day or two, I think it was a day or two, and they liked me and they liked the way I went about doing things.

21:06.948 --> 21:22.028
And so this individual received an assignment and they asked me to come up and take the job permanently, which was, again, another tough job for me because it was 12 hours a day, five days a week, six hours on Saturday.

21:22.008 --> 21:34.752
And at the same time, I was working on completing a master's degree with the University of Southern California Extension program there and finishing up one of my military education

21:35.002 --> 21:36.684
classes that I had to take.

21:37.385 --> 21:45.556
So it was the days that I saw the sun go down and I saw it come back up again, particularly working statistics in my master's program.

21:45.576 --> 21:46.798
That was a toughie for me.

21:46.858 --> 21:52.425
Doing all of this, trying to tend to your family, get some sleep, do all of that in only 24 hours.

21:53.286 --> 22:01.397
So whatever work ethic you had not learned as a child in Alabama, you certainly learned at this period of your military service.

22:01.799 --> 22:04.144
It was a time that I will never forget.

22:04.785 --> 22:14.644
It was a time that I would not necessarily want to do over again, but certainly I'm very appreciative for having the opportunity to do all those things at the same time and having

22:15.113 --> 22:19.001
the family stand behind me and move forward.

22:19.341 --> 22:33.088
It's time to go back to the States, and you were assigned, of all places, to go back home, to Montgomery, Alabama, where you thought you were going to be for long enough, so long that you bought a house, but then, as so often happens with the military, things can change in a moment, right?

22:33.119 --> 22:43.155
Yes, they told me that I was going to be there for at least another two years at Gunter Air Force Station in Alabama, and a month after I bought the house, I got an assignment.

22:43.796 --> 22:44.517
To go to Illinois.

22:44.597 --> 22:51.668
To go to Illinois, to go to Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois, which was not very, which did not make a happy camper.

22:51.688 --> 22:51.748
No.

22:51.768 --> 22:52.529
Weather wasn't good.

22:52.609 --> 22:53.250
It was cold there.

22:53.411 --> 22:56.856
Cold snow would be up to the eaves of the house.

22:56.916 --> 23:00.662
It would get wind chill packed up to past 50 degrees.

23:00.642 --> 23:02.625
below zero in the wintertime.

23:02.645 --> 23:09.574
It was a tough assignment, but it turned out, Tom, to be my best assignment in terms of career advancement.

23:09.595 --> 23:11.537
You worked for a female general there.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.759
You were there from 78 to 81.

23:13.159 --> 23:13.460
Yes.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.262
You worked for a female general there.

23:15.282 --> 23:18.567
Yes, and she took care of me.

23:18.547 --> 23:39.171
And from the standpoint that when my two years was up and I was ready to go, it was a three-year assignment, but I was ready to go at two, and I told her I was ready to go, and she went and talked to the right people, and I was able to get an assignment as a squadron commander there at Williams Air Force Base.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.754
which you called a plum assignment at Williams Air Force Base.

23:41.774 --> 23:42.815
It was a plum assignment.

23:43.115 --> 23:45.697
It was a busy base doing the things that you loved to do.

23:45.978 --> 23:46.378
Yes.

23:46.398 --> 23:49.601
Besides working, besides being an engineer, playing a little golf too.

23:49.621 --> 23:50.822
We had our own golf course.

23:51.683 --> 23:59.451
We did a lot of training programs on that golf course, like build a pond so that the hole wouldn't be a boring hole.

23:59.491 --> 24:01.613
You had to hit over water a lot of times.

24:02.013 --> 24:04.356
We did that with our training teams.

24:05.196 --> 24:06.778
Right, right, right.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.696
You started playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base.

24:09.716 --> 24:13.400
As a matter of fact, that's where he's an accomplished golfer right now, folks.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.342
I'll tell you that right now.

24:14.662 --> 24:18.547
We've only got about three and a half minutes left, so we've got to kind of move on.

24:18.567 --> 24:21.751
You were promoted to lieutenant colonel on time.

24:21.811 --> 24:23.974
You were hoping for an early promotion.

24:23.994 --> 24:28.480
You didn't get that, but it was followed by a quite early promotion to colonel.

24:28.460 --> 24:37.723
Yes, it was a surprise to me as well as to a lot of people that I was promoted two years ahead of my contemporary for full colonel.

24:38.204 --> 24:45.422
And I suppose I was disappointed because I didn't make it early as lieutenant colonel.

24:46.145 --> 24:47.167
I'd worked pretty hard.

24:47.568 --> 25:07.663
There were certain things you have to do to be competitive and one like have a master's degree, another would have all your military training courses completed and hopefully completed near the top of your class and so that you get that extra recognition and get your performance reports endorsed at the highest level.

25:07.643 --> 25:12.395
That is, if your supervisor agrees, that's what needs to be done.

25:12.415 --> 25:19.473
And I had those, but it was just one of those things that the Air Force had its time.

25:19.573 --> 25:25.247
I had mine, and they had that timeline, and that timeline was one that we had to follow.

25:25.885 --> 25:35.496
You were transferred to the Pentagon as chief engineer for Air Force Building and Systems, a job that you quite frankly called boring for a guy that had been in the field for most of his career.

25:36.377 --> 25:45.869
And that's when you got a call from Colonel Dan Taylor, who was in San Diego at the time, and that's when your life kind of changed right then.

25:45.889 --> 25:51.715
Yes, they wanted me to come out and apply for that job as a physical plant director.

25:52.056 --> 25:53.057
I was...

25:53.510 --> 25:56.333
not really happy, ready to do that.

25:56.373 --> 25:59.536
And I told him that, but they convinced me to come out.

25:59.636 --> 26:04.822
And when I came up, went there, I didn't think that I was going to get the job, but they offered me the job.

26:04.862 --> 26:19.197
Then I was in a quandary because I had to complete three years worth of, uh, military service to make up for my year of residency there in school at the industrial college of the, of the armed forces.

26:19.970 --> 26:28.478
However, one of my other bosses was able to get the Secretary of Air Force to give me a waiver to waiver that.

26:28.795 --> 26:34.941
The other thing I had to do is that I had to give up being a full colonel and retire as a lieutenant colonel.

26:35.141 --> 26:35.982
Right.

26:36.302 --> 26:46.111
Which is a little bit of a pay change, and we've got just less than a minute left, so the rest of the story goes that you went to work at San Diego State in charge of facilities there.

26:46.131 --> 26:48.994
In 1995, you decided you needed to change the scenery.

26:49.014 --> 26:52.597
You applied for the job at A&M, and you've been here for some 15 years.

26:52.917 --> 26:54.839
Almost 15 years, yes.

26:54.859 --> 26:55.680
Right.

26:55.660 --> 26:56.842
Believe it or not, we're out of time.

26:56.882 --> 27:03.350
This goes so fast, but we've just jetted through quite a life so far, some 65 years.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.713
And thank you very much for your service and for being here.

27:06.014 --> 27:07.356
And thank you for inviting me.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.077
All right.

27:08.097 --> 27:18.951
When Chuck Sipiel made the tough decision to leave the Air Force to go to work at San Diego State in 1989, it was a choice that would eventually benefit not only A&M and its tremendous growth.

27:18.931 --> 27:24.703
but our entire community that has respected his vast volunteer work and friendship for 15 years.

27:25.044 --> 27:30.595
And now you know about his talents as he served the United States as an officer in the United States Air Force.

27:31.156 --> 27:33.882
We salute Colonel Chuck Sipiel for his service to our country.

27:34.363 --> 27:35.305
I'm Tom Turberville.

27:35.786 --> 27:37.750
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
