00:04.840 --> 00:26.913
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:27.214 --> 00:28.215
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:28.870 --> 00:42.475
There are thousands of military jobs involved with fighting the war in Iraq, but Captain Mark White, A&M Class of 2003, had one of the more fascinating deployments as a member of Alpha Company 111th Engineer Battalion.

00:42.877 --> 00:55.197
It had nothing to do with engineering, but everything to do with security for the constant flow of generals, presidents, senators, media, song and dance folks, and other assorted VIPs visiting the country.

00:55.217 --> 01:05.413
The detail that goes into a seemingly simple visit to Iraq by a dignitary may surprise you, but it was his job to make sure that there were few, if any, surprises for the guest.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.378
Please welcome Captain Mark White to Veterans of the Valley.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.266
Fascinating job.

01:10.286 --> 01:16.311
When you first went over there, did you realize that that's what you were gonna do, that that was gonna be your deployment, that you were gonna do that?

01:16.552 --> 01:17.777
We knew about,

01:18.331 --> 01:21.775
for sure about three months before we were going.

01:21.795 --> 01:29.825
So then we started our preparation and we had several exercises and we spent three weeks at Fort Polk, Louisiana doing a mission rehearsal exercise and that's all we focused on.

01:31.207 --> 01:37.114
The thing about it is that you train for it a certain way and then it's not really what you think it's going to be until you get there.

01:37.335 --> 01:37.775
Right.

01:37.795 --> 01:41.740
And so we had a about 10 day time period where we would

01:41.720 --> 01:42.701
Watch at first.

01:42.721 --> 02:05.866
We just watched the people that were taken over for and then they would watch us just make sure we're doing it right Right and a huge part of is this building contacts and learning routes and ways to go because you Spend so much time out throughout the country that you gotta know where you're going It doesn't surprise me that that's the way you're prepared for it because smooth running operation is exactly what you did that that was part of your job now you all were based Near Baghdad right outside the airport.

02:05.906 --> 02:06.306
Is that right?

02:06.366 --> 02:08.048
Yes, sir at the victory base compound

02:08.298 --> 02:11.563
And now there was a hotel involved, which is sort of the main hotel.

02:11.863 --> 02:15.068
Talk about that hotel and what it used to be and what it was used for.

02:15.088 --> 02:20.255
The hotel was, you know, we used it to house the senior level dignitaries.

02:21.117 --> 02:22.198
We had, I think, nine suites.

02:22.218 --> 02:26.965
They're all nice, had marble, showers, flushing toilets, all the things that were really nice to have in Iraq.

02:27.646 --> 02:29.749
Before that, prior to that, it was used as a

02:30.134 --> 02:35.020
kind of a weekend brothel for Saddam and his fellow Baptist.

02:35.361 --> 02:37.363
So I guess it's kind of a fascinating place, right?

02:37.503 --> 02:38.485
It's pretty nice.

02:39.546 --> 02:41.949
It had its own private dining room, a lakeside view.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.873
Not the typical things you get in Iraq.

02:45.073 --> 02:48.798
No, but your missions didn't really involve a whole lot there.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.640
You were mainly out in the field.

02:50.890 --> 02:53.033
Talk about what your job was.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.596
Like I say, it's very fascinating.

02:54.636 --> 02:58.422
And whenever a dignitary came to Iraq, that's when you went to work.

02:58.802 --> 02:59.183
Exactly.

02:59.203 --> 03:04.771
We would know, you know, sometimes weeks in advance, sometimes days in advance when someone was coming.

03:05.172 --> 03:13.084
And from the point that they were approved to come to Iraq, we would get an itinerary and we'd flesh it out, make sure it would work, make sure it was functional.

03:13.064 --> 03:16.467
and then execute it from the time that person landed in Iraq.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.169
And it didn't necessarily have to be in Baghdad.

03:18.189 --> 03:20.411
They could land down south in Najaf or up in Mosul.

03:20.851 --> 03:30.840
We'd pick them up and meet them there, and we were responsible for their security, their logistics, their travel, everything that encompassed their time in Iraq was what was our responsibility.

03:30.940 --> 03:35.384
Ultimately, we focused the most on security because that's what was paramount for our mission to be a success.

03:35.684 --> 03:37.606
Right, right.

03:37.906 --> 03:38.347
Who came?

03:38.627 --> 03:39.668
Who were you in charge of?

03:39.728 --> 03:41.029
What kind of people?

03:41.701 --> 03:44.772
Name some titles and some people.

03:44.832 --> 03:45.916
Who were they?

03:45.956 --> 03:49.348
You know, it varied from low-level

03:49.683 --> 03:59.157
in the full scheme of things, low-level staff, general officers from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, the President of Poland.

04:00.399 --> 04:13.317
The Koreans had a contingent there, so they would have, South Koreans, would have a lot of their senior military, all the military defense people from other countries that were part of the coalition.

04:13.938 --> 04:16.602
And then, as well as...

04:17.071 --> 04:32.532
The MWI, the morale welfare people like Toby Keith, Rascal Flats, Jessica Simpson, there's all kinds of people, and then dance teams, cheerleading teams, and then lots of senators and congressmen and women would come over.

04:32.512 --> 04:36.940
Now, you were there from December to December, 2004 to 2005.

04:37.160 --> 04:37.421
Yes, sir.

04:37.601 --> 04:39.545
You were there for that year.

04:39.565 --> 04:41.749
So you mentioned the senators.

04:41.829 --> 04:49.543
I mean, some of the high-profile people that we've heard of, just about all of them came through because they wanted to be there, and it was good politically to say they'd been to Iraq, right?

04:49.643 --> 04:50.164
Yes, sir.

04:50.184 --> 04:55.233
There's a nice little stipulation that if you spend one day in a war zone, you get tax-free for that month.

04:55.814 --> 04:55.954
Mm-hmm.

04:55.934 --> 05:02.544
I don't want to say that was their agenda, but I'm sure it's not a bad thing because some would spend one day in Iraq.

05:02.845 --> 05:08.714
But they would come and, you know, I kind of judge my impression of a senator on what their itinerary was.

05:08.754 --> 05:13.842
If they just came and just talked to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense and Minister of the Interior of Iraq,

05:13.822 --> 05:14.383
That's one thing.

05:14.403 --> 05:18.571
But some guys, and it would take time to make sure that they met their delegates.

05:18.591 --> 05:23.039
They would be sure that they had a breakfast with everyone that's in their district.

05:23.059 --> 05:29.411
And so, you know, I was fortunate enough, you know, the representative from the Abilene area where, you know, it was based, he came and had a barbecue dinner with us.

05:29.592 --> 05:29.852
Right.

05:30.093 --> 05:34.581
And he just happened to be with Tom Osborne on that trip when Tom Osborne was a senator for...

05:34.561 --> 05:35.502
for Nebraska.

05:35.582 --> 05:36.864
So it was a neat, neat trip.

05:37.064 --> 05:37.665
It was indeed.

05:37.945 --> 05:40.729
Now the officers, they would be pretty much service bodyguards.

05:40.769 --> 05:45.696
I mean, they would serve, they would stay close to the VIP and you as an officer, that would be your role?

05:45.896 --> 05:46.437
Yes sir, exactly.

05:46.457 --> 05:52.725
We would label ourselves the escort officer and then we'd have the PSD, the protective services detachment or detail.

05:53.226 --> 05:54.327
And that would be the enlisted guys.

05:54.347 --> 06:00.315
It would be the outer, the outer ring that would provide the security, you know,

06:00.953 --> 06:06.119
a little distance out, whereas the escort officer or the officers, we have to be one, you know, no further than one door away.

06:06.159 --> 06:17.733
We always make sure that we're right there, close enough that, you know, if it happened and if harm came in their way, we could grab them, snatch them, throw them in a truck and get out of there or get on the helicopter, whatever we needed to do to get away from the threat.

06:18.054 --> 06:22.519
Tell you what, this is a story that can really, really best be told in pictures.

06:22.539 --> 06:27.665
And Mark has quite a few photographs that he took from his year in Iraq.

06:27.685 --> 06:29.668
And let's go to just a few of them right now.

06:29.688 --> 06:30.589
We have several pictures.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.566
Here's our first, get Mark to comment on each one.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.468
That's the unit?

06:35.488 --> 06:37.110
That's the company, yes, that's the Alpha Company.

06:37.451 --> 06:41.936
And this is at Fort Hood prior to us getting our desert uniforms.

06:41.956 --> 06:50.887
We spent three months at Fort Hood training, going over just basic combat skills, making sure everybody's refreshed, getting certified on our combat lifesaver skills.

06:51.728 --> 06:53.870
And we actually had a detachment come down.

06:53.951 --> 07:00.238
We worked on advanced driving skills, you know, how to pit a car and how to run someone off the road properly without hurting them.

07:00.353 --> 07:05.039
Now, if I'm right, correct me if I'm wrong, I think that's you sitting right behind the flag, is that right?

07:05.059 --> 07:06.380
That is, yes, that's me right there.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.943
That's right, I recognized you right there in the front row.

07:08.963 --> 07:10.365
Okay, let's move on.

07:10.385 --> 07:11.967
This is me at the NATO compound.

07:12.307 --> 07:20.557
You know, NATO had a role there to kind of set up the schools and help educate some of the people within the government there.

07:20.817 --> 07:25.703
And so they had a nice compound, and the significance of this was this was one of the first times I saw grass.

07:25.683 --> 07:26.444
in Iraq.

07:26.484 --> 07:30.452
There's not a whole lot of it out there and so I was happy to see it.

07:31.473 --> 07:32.736
It's like a country club setting.

07:32.956 --> 07:33.257
It did.

07:33.277 --> 07:33.938
It was real nice.

07:33.958 --> 07:34.118
Yeah.

07:34.238 --> 07:34.579
Muster.

07:34.940 --> 07:35.260
Muster.

07:35.280 --> 07:41.792
We had a pretty good turnout if you think about the amount of civilians and military people in Iraq.

07:41.812 --> 07:47.362
They also had another Muster downtown, Baghdad, but we had the largest one in the country.

07:47.382 --> 07:50.087
Also of note in here is the current

07:50.405 --> 07:57.435
Vice President of the Student Affairs for A&M, General Weber, when he was in Baghdad as the multinational forces Iraq chief of staff.

07:59.158 --> 07:59.879
That's a great shot.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.846
And that's the multinational forces Iraq headquarters on Victory Base.

08:05.066 --> 08:10.755
This is kind of the view off our back porch at our office building and the hotel as well.

08:10.815 --> 08:17.745
And a lot of our meetings would take place over at that building just because that's where some of the senior military leaders were at and where they needed to meet with.

08:17.725 --> 08:22.830
Now, is this a building here that was, obviously, it used to be something else, or was it built specifically for the war?

08:23.070 --> 08:27.474
It was one of Saddam's weekend getaways, one of those little palaces.

08:28.955 --> 08:47.732
On the other side of that, you can't see it, but there's two bridges that go out to it, and the coalition blew up those bridges when they came in, and then they said, we met lots of people that came in that were on that initial invasion, talked about how much money was just in that building alone, and they had to take truckloads of it out, because that's where Saddam was stashing some of the stuff.

08:47.712 --> 08:50.757
Well, I'm glad he built such nice office buildings.

08:51.258 --> 08:53.482
This is a beautiful Iraq at sunset, right?

08:53.502 --> 08:53.742
Yes, sir.

08:53.903 --> 08:59.692
Yeah, just, you know, something to add that, you know, maybe a war-torn country, but it certainly has its beautiful moments.

08:59.712 --> 09:06.063
This is on the other side of the lake from the front view of our office, and that's one of the intelligence buildings.

09:06.123 --> 09:08.207
They had several other little compounds over by it.

09:08.227 --> 09:09.990
That's a lookout tower of some sort, I guess.

09:10.544 --> 09:11.125
Yes, sir.

09:11.145 --> 09:13.107
Well, it's actually just a part of that.

09:13.127 --> 09:15.050
It's kind of just scenic.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.893
Yeah, that's great.

09:16.953 --> 09:17.093
Okay.

09:18.334 --> 09:18.995
Go ahead.

09:19.035 --> 09:19.756
This is me.

09:19.937 --> 09:21.719
I was an escort officer for Donald Rumsfeld.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.122
I think it was April.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.105
April 11th was when this trip was.

09:26.125 --> 09:31.672
And this was right at the airfield where the helicopters took off, right next to the embassy.

09:31.692 --> 09:32.554
We were right beside the embassy.

09:33.094 --> 09:38.121
And he was right back there talking to General Casey, who was the force commander of Iraq at the time.

09:38.776 --> 09:40.198
And they spent a lot of time together.

09:40.618 --> 09:45.184
And I got the pleasure of being the escort officer for them.

09:45.785 --> 09:50.471
That had to have been quite an honor, really.

09:50.672 --> 09:51.292
It was.

09:51.352 --> 09:52.314
It's a lot of work.

09:52.754 --> 09:53.415
It's a lot of work.

09:54.076 --> 10:01.506
If you've ever wanted to put yourself in a helicopter over Iraq during wartime and looking down on Baghdad, this is what you see, right?

10:01.566 --> 10:02.167
That's what you see.

10:02.207 --> 10:04.750
This is just a little part of downtown Baghdad, flying over it.

10:06.215 --> 10:08.878
You can see how close the houses are and how close the communities are.

10:08.898 --> 10:11.181
Now you talked about some of the celebrities were there.

10:11.341 --> 10:12.262
This is a sample.

10:12.302 --> 10:12.983
Who are we looking at?

10:13.003 --> 10:16.007
Yeah, Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey and their tour manager.

10:17.068 --> 10:17.689
I don't know his name.

10:18.149 --> 10:19.631
Yeah, and their tour manager.

10:19.731 --> 10:22.875
Tour manager looks like he wants to be somewhere else.

10:22.895 --> 10:25.017
Yeah, most of them did.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.160
That's right.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.401
They're not married anymore, right?

10:28.542 --> 10:29.022
No.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.506
It looks like they were fighting right then.

10:32.526 --> 10:35.029
Yes sir.

10:35.430 --> 10:41.357
A lot of the celebrity types would go from base to base and fly them around and they would put on a show.

10:41.937 --> 10:43.779
They'd have very aggressive, very busy schedules.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.084
They'd be really tired at the end, but they were always very grateful for what you did.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.689
We were thankful for them taking the time to come over and provide some entertainment.

10:51.949 --> 10:52.810
Absolutely.

10:52.790 --> 10:56.654
This is north up in the town of Mosul, which is close to Turkey.

10:57.835 --> 11:02.220
There's grass up there, and it's green up there, and it's a lot milder temperature.

11:02.921 --> 11:05.023
It's always pleasant to go up there, and this is right there.

11:05.063 --> 11:09.828
We're waiting for our helicopters to come pick us up and take us back down to Baghdad outside of Mosul.

11:10.789 --> 11:11.049
Okay.

11:12.531 --> 11:14.433
This is a small village in Iraq?

11:14.553 --> 11:14.833
Yes, sir.

11:15.514 --> 11:17.476
Around the countryside, there's just these random villages.

11:17.496 --> 11:21.160
They'll have one road going in, one road going out.

11:21.494 --> 11:37.680
We'd fly over them throughout our trips around Iraq, and we'd throw out soccer balls or candy or something, because they're isolated villages, and the kids would just come storming out of the buildings whenever they heard the helicopters, and they'd wave and do something for them.

11:38.639 --> 11:39.140
Wow.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.302
We've got some more pictures.

11:41.083 --> 11:46.131
Mark has brought a couple of things, and this is one of your armor jackets, is that right?

11:46.151 --> 11:47.092
Yes, this is our body armor.

11:47.132 --> 11:52.561
We'd wear pretty much everywhere, and it doesn't have the plates in it.

11:52.581 --> 12:04.359
We had to turn the plates back in in Kuwait, so it's fairly heavy, but it provides sufficient protection from any kind of small caliber weapon unless you got shot in the face.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.681
That's right.

12:05.701 --> 12:06.402
Fortunately, you

12:06.888 --> 12:08.231
You wore it, but you didn't need it, right?

12:08.251 --> 12:08.853
Exactly.

12:08.873 --> 12:09.494
That's good.

12:09.515 --> 12:10.858
I was happy to have that.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.322
That's a good thing.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.971
A lot of the media, sometimes it would come over.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.880
Would you be on a detail with some of the media also that would be over there?

12:19.900 --> 12:24.171
I know you mentioned Peter Jennings, not long before he passed away was there.

12:24.151 --> 12:26.274
you got to spend some time with him?

12:26.294 --> 12:26.895
I did.

12:27.055 --> 12:37.149
There was, especially around election time when there was, you know, the country is at such a volatile point and the success of those elections were determining, you know, where the country would move forward and there's such a big stake in the U.S.

12:37.169 --> 12:37.710
interest in there.

12:38.431 --> 12:42.717
All the media would be there, including, you know, Peter Jennings, who was

12:43.102 --> 12:47.332
you know, we'd forgot about until we looked back later on that he'd, you know, he'd passed away, you know, I think.

12:47.412 --> 12:48.234
Right, he was in August.

12:48.816 --> 12:54.951
He had passed away, and I looked it up, he had passed away in August of that year, the year August of 2005.

12:55.051 --> 12:55.913
Yes, sir.

12:56.753 --> 13:00.199
He was real easygoing, real mild-tempered.

13:00.780 --> 13:06.069
He liked to come talk to the guys, just talk to the lower enlisted and just talk about the day and whatnot.

13:07.812 --> 13:10.536
Other people from the media talked to you a little bit about Geraldo being there.

13:10.636 --> 13:11.718
Yeah, kind of a party guy.

13:11.879 --> 13:14.223
Kind of a party guy, had a little stuff in the room.

13:16.226 --> 13:17.869
It's nice enough to leave back for everyone else.

13:18.069 --> 13:19.251
Right.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.994
And then General McCaffrey, General Wayne Downing.

13:22.254 --> 13:22.755
Right.

13:22.775 --> 13:25.799
And then you'd see all the Fox News people would be over there.

13:25.819 --> 13:27.601
You and McCaffrey got pretty tight, right?

13:27.741 --> 13:28.061
We did.

13:28.281 --> 13:30.524
Me and I got to know General Barry McCaffrey very well.

13:30.564 --> 13:32.666
Spent 11 days straight with him.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.269
And we went all over the country, everywhere.

13:35.369 --> 13:37.132
Just me and him in our detail.

13:37.172 --> 13:39.554
And I ended up keeping in touch with him later on.

13:39.574 --> 13:42.077
He's a really good guy.

13:42.117 --> 13:45.041
He's been so involved in the military and U.S.

13:45.061 --> 13:46.302
government for so long.

13:46.282 --> 13:49.506
He has so many stories, you know.

13:49.586 --> 13:50.127
Right.

13:50.428 --> 14:03.645
I just really enjoyed being around him and hearing Wally and say, and then it's neat to see how General Petraeus, General Vine, some of the senior leaders would look up to him so much and really cared about to hear what he had to say.

14:03.666 --> 14:07.090
You know, he spent a lot of time with General Casey over at his house.

14:07.110 --> 14:15.141
I want people to understand that when you got an itinerary for a VIP that was coming, you'd actually go through this itinerary twice because before they ever got there,

14:15.560 --> 14:21.249
You would go where they were going to go just to check everything out, check security, and then you'd actually be on the mission, right?

14:21.350 --> 14:21.850
Oh, yes.

14:21.870 --> 14:30.044
I mean, it was imperative that we flushed out any kinks that could possibly arise and make sure that we had a contingency plan for the whole itinerary.

14:30.966 --> 14:41.483
The day before, if possible, we would run through it start to finish, and then we'd have a big briefing, make sure that everybody knew exactly what the role was because there's so many

14:41.935 --> 14:43.577
places within our wreck where you could get stopped.

14:43.597 --> 14:46.199
There could be a hiccup or security you need to worry about.

14:46.239 --> 14:52.606
And so we'd make sure we had everything covered and we were fortunate to not really have any issues throughout the whole year.

14:52.846 --> 14:53.867
Right, right.

14:53.887 --> 14:54.728
None that you could plan.

14:54.788 --> 15:00.975
Now I know that there were weather problems, sandstorms and things like that that would mess up the original itinerary.

15:00.995 --> 15:02.396
Yeah, we couldn't plan for the weather.

15:02.937 --> 15:11.065
We would do our best, but if a sandstorm came in and it would make visibility zero, you'd have to have a hard time seeing your hand in front of your face.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.584
Helicopters can't fly in that.

15:14.005 --> 15:19.675
And it's also, it's a big time for insurgents to kind of put out their roadside bombs and things like that.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.398
So it's not safe at that time.

15:22.099 --> 15:25.746
And so we would try to have some kind of backup plan.

15:26.182 --> 15:27.303
It depends upon where you're at.

15:27.323 --> 15:41.675
Now sometimes you may just get stuck out in the middle of nowhere at a remote location and you're just gonna have to do... I felt bad because sometimes that local commander, that lieutenant colonel, will get stuck with this four-star general for three or four hours longer than he wanted.

15:41.876 --> 15:44.017
He'd have a set plan for what he had to do and what he had to show.

15:44.658 --> 15:48.481
Then he's just kind of stuck on the spot, not knowing what he's doing.

15:48.501 --> 15:50.443
All right, well, you want to see the hallway.

15:50.763 --> 15:51.344
Here's the hallway.

15:52.865 --> 15:56.188
We saw the picture of you on the detail with Secretary Rumsfeld.

15:56.168 --> 15:58.631
That was a little bit different than most.

15:58.671 --> 15:59.692
I guess a lot of them came.

15:59.732 --> 16:00.754
They had an itinerary.

16:00.774 --> 16:01.935
They pretty much stuck to it.

16:02.536 --> 16:04.198
But this guy was the boss.

16:04.218 --> 16:07.943
I guess his plan changed hour to hour sometimes.

16:07.963 --> 16:08.263
Oh, definitely.

16:08.323 --> 16:18.796
We had started video teleconferences about three weeks in advance, at least, between me, the embassy, and back to the Department of Defense and his people.

16:18.816 --> 16:23.802
And that is almost a daily thing, if I want to change this or change that.

16:23.822 --> 16:26.125
And then a big thing for him was wanting to go see...

16:26.105 --> 16:36.047
Mr. Barzani, who was the president of the Kurds, and he wanted to see him, and Barzani wanted to talk to Donald Rumsfeld as well, and Kurds have a big interest in the country.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.615
But the big thing was deciding on where to meet at.

16:40.897 --> 16:46.189
Mr. Rumsfeld, Secretary Rumsfeld, want to meet him down in Iraq and Baghdad, because that's where he was going to be at anyway for some

16:46.456 --> 16:48.101
meetings of their Senate type place.

16:49.004 --> 16:50.529
Mr. Barzani didn't want to see him there.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.994
He wanted to see him at his private compound.

16:52.697 --> 16:56.449
And then that just created a whole litany of issues because his compound is

16:56.817 --> 17:08.440
seven hours north of Baghdad, in the hills, away from everything else, with no room to, Secretary of Rumsfeld, we had six helicopters, and another four Apache gunships flying around.

17:08.581 --> 17:10.184
It's a pretty big deal.

17:10.304 --> 17:18.741
And he has such a big entourage, and so he takes this little big compound, and this apocalypse now scene of all these helicopters coming in.

17:18.721 --> 17:22.407
It was interesting nonetheless, but it came out fine.

17:22.467 --> 17:30.099
They got to have their meeting, everything worked out, and we just flew Mr. Rumsfeld out of a different location than where initially planned.

17:30.219 --> 17:35.408
Let's go to some more photographs right now that Captain Mark White has supplied to us here.

17:35.508 --> 17:38.012
We'll go look at them here.

17:37.992 --> 17:39.114
This is up in Kirkuk.

17:39.756 --> 17:46.691
This is actually Jerry Patterson, who's the Veterans Land Board Commissioner of Texas, an Aggie grad, a Vietnam vet.

17:46.711 --> 17:49.558
He actually came with the VFW when they had a contingency come.

17:50.239 --> 17:55.090
And he was a proud Aggie, and we found another proud Aggie up in Kirkuk near the oil fields, and we all took a picture.

17:55.424 --> 17:57.027
That's great, that's a great picture.

17:57.328 --> 17:58.871
I know Jerry, he's a good man.

17:58.891 --> 17:59.993
I really appreciate this time.

18:00.775 --> 18:04.983
This is in Balad, this is where you see a lot of things about that main hospital, that's where it's at.

18:05.304 --> 18:17.027
This is actually one of the Predator drones, which provides, it's an unmanned aerial vehicle that provides a lot of reconnaissance, a lot of intelligence, and you also notice a missile attached to it in case it needs to take care of something en route.

18:19.117 --> 18:21.831
That's quite a weapon.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.600
This is an outstanding photograph.

18:23.922 --> 18:27.118
This is the landing pad up in Mosul.

18:28.364 --> 18:31.809
There was only four spots, and that's where we parked the four helicopters.

18:32.670 --> 18:35.714
And that's actually on a mountain, and it was always like going to Mosul.

18:35.734 --> 18:41.363
It was always real nice and they had good food there, which is what I'd judge bases on, how their food was.

18:41.383 --> 18:44.207
But you catch a lot of turbulence.

18:44.807 --> 18:50.716
If you're on that last helicopter and you had to run down that line to get out of the flight line, you'd feel a lot of wind.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.578
So it was always interesting.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.862
So you'd gotten out of your chopper to take this picture, is that right?

18:55.322 --> 18:55.883
I had, yes.

18:55.903 --> 18:56.464
Yes, ma'am.

18:58.334 --> 19:10.923
This is some of our company here, and right outside our little quarters on Victory Base, we'd make a lot of plaques to tell people, thank you, that helped us out over in the force headquarters or the core headquarters.

19:14.030 --> 19:14.571
Good picture.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.327
This is me re-enlisting.

19:16.368 --> 19:22.473
He's a First Sergeant Leonard now, at the time he was in E6, but I was re-enlisting him into the Army for another six years.

19:22.533 --> 19:28.579
It was kind of a pleasure for me, because I was enlisted before, and he was actually my squad leader while I was in Bosnia.

19:29.179 --> 19:43.512
As a 19-year-old kid, he made me roll around in the dirt, roll around in the grass, and then here, six years later, I had the opportunity and the pleasure to re-enlist him in the Army, and he's been a great person to bounce things off of throughout the years.

19:45.972 --> 19:46.513
Good picture.

19:47.515 --> 19:48.256
Toby Keith concert?

19:48.296 --> 19:49.399
Toby Keith, yes, sir.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.042
He came down, put on a big show.

19:51.062 --> 20:00.380
I think they actually cut to this during the CMA Awards, and he sang a song, and he did a full concert there for us at the Victory Base, and that was a big deal, as you can see.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.023
Everybody wanted to come out there, and they wanted to

20:02.375 --> 20:04.418
wanted to pile in and get as close as they could.

20:04.438 --> 20:05.840
He put on a great show.

20:06.581 --> 20:12.490
It was a nice thing to kind of get your mind off, you know, what's going on around you, just kind of for a minute, for 30 minutes, for an hour, whatever it was.

20:12.510 --> 20:16.676
You get to just kind of relax and enjoy a little bit of country music and someone to appreciate.

20:16.736 --> 20:17.597
He's got some great songs.

20:17.797 --> 20:22.965
Now Mark, you know that there's veterans watching this show right now, World War II veterans, that are looking at this picture.

20:22.945 --> 20:27.291
And they're thinking back to the time that they sat and watched Bob Hope entertain.

20:27.951 --> 20:29.073
So this is the same thing.

20:29.113 --> 20:32.778
Just fast forward and you've got other entertainers doing the same thing.

20:32.798 --> 20:33.258
Yes, sir.

20:33.559 --> 20:33.759
Yeah.

20:34.880 --> 20:35.982
That's great.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.244
Good picture.

20:37.264 --> 20:37.524
Good one.

20:38.305 --> 20:47.637
Here's me and a couple other Aggies, Casey Tutte and their fellows that both class of 99, class of 97.

20:47.617 --> 20:52.726
There was a few of us, and we'd get together when we could, and share old A&M memories, talk about the game that week.

20:52.746 --> 20:56.092
I used to get up at 3 in the morning to listen to Dave South on a radio broadcast.

20:56.132 --> 21:00.379
I'd find a computer and get on the internet and listen, and these guys do the same.

21:00.620 --> 21:05.628
This is over at their compound at Camp Slayer, which is right beside where I was at, another man-made lake.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.193
All right.

21:08.213 --> 21:09.194
You mentioned Dave, of course.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.278
Mark and I both work on the...

21:11.579 --> 21:12.863
the football broadcast.

21:13.043 --> 21:14.828
We have a lot of fun doing that.

21:16.493 --> 21:21.207
This was not your first deployment overseas when you were 19 years old.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.029
You were in Bosnia.

21:22.170 --> 21:22.671
Yes, sir.

21:22.691 --> 21:24.677
Talk about briefly about that deployment.

21:24.860 --> 21:28.085
At that time we'd start off with the same company actually, Alpha Company 111.

21:28.105 --> 21:31.250
We were supposed to do an engineering mission to begin with.

21:31.310 --> 21:41.827
We were going to help with demining operations, help the Bosnians go ahead and remove mines as part of their agreement to do with some of the conventions at the Dayton Accords.

21:42.668 --> 21:46.434
And about a week into our mission rehearsal exercise, they said, no, you're going to do base defense.

21:46.454 --> 21:48.096
So we're like, okay.

21:48.257 --> 21:53.044
So I worked at the main gate, the vehicle gate there to get traffic in and out, which was

21:53.227 --> 21:54.068
It was kind of interesting.

21:54.449 --> 21:55.310
Lowly gate guy.

21:55.330 --> 21:56.151
Lowly gate guy.

21:56.372 --> 21:59.597
Working the gate, searching cars, searching people, taking their alcohol away.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.604
Not a popular gate guy all the time.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.206
Not a popular job, no.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.249
But I learned a lot.

22:08.390 --> 22:13.457
And it so happens I was selected soldier of the year, S-47, Task Force Eagle soldier of the year.

22:13.938 --> 22:20.027
And that's ultimately led me to become an officer was after that time, a lot of officers came and talked to me and they're like, you know, you have some college hours.

22:20.243 --> 22:22.065
maybe you should consider going to the officer field.

22:22.085 --> 22:23.467
And that's only what I did.

22:23.547 --> 22:31.996
But that was a great learning experience for me because four years later when I go to Iraq, I'd already had that going away from home moment.

22:32.016 --> 22:32.857
It was sad at the time.

22:33.818 --> 22:39.985
When I went back the second time, it was easier to kind of put my arm around the guys and keep their heads up when they were feeling down because I had a lot of young soldiers.

22:40.065 --> 22:44.050
It was their first time away from home and going to a tumultuous area.

22:44.170 --> 22:44.410
Right.

22:44.430 --> 22:48.976
So that experience when you were young helped you when you were in Iraq, obviously.

22:49.016 --> 22:49.356
Definitely.

22:49.336 --> 22:51.179
You've been home for about three years now.

22:51.199 --> 22:51.960
Yes, sir.

22:52.380 --> 22:57.888
But you plan on a deployment going back sometime between next summer and the summer after that.

22:58.109 --> 22:58.509
Is that right?

22:58.970 --> 22:59.150
Yes, sir.

22:59.170 --> 22:59.731
Talk about that.

23:01.013 --> 23:09.505
You know, just the way the state of affairs are and the way the Texas Army National Guard is, your dwell time or your time at home usually is more than three or four years.

23:09.485 --> 23:14.072
Currently, there's lots of soldiers from the state of Texas that are deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.

23:15.113 --> 23:21.803
As a company commander, I've given up my fair share of soldiers that have deployed in recent months, or will deploy this summer, and I'm in that same boat.

23:22.023 --> 23:23.466
They need soldiers.

23:24.247 --> 23:31.257
My take on it is I'm a single, or I don't have any kids, or I'm not married yet.

23:31.237 --> 23:32.819
I'd better take their place.

23:33.039 --> 23:36.944
That's such a burden and such a hard time on families to lose a loved one.

23:37.425 --> 23:43.633
And so I'd like to do it now while I'm young, while I'm single and don't have any children, to take on that responsibility.

23:43.653 --> 23:47.638
So I try to put my name in the pot.

23:47.658 --> 23:52.364
Even if my name doesn't go in the pot, it will be put in there anyway by someone else for a brigade headquarters.

23:52.384 --> 23:52.625
Right.

23:52.645 --> 23:55.168
And your next deployment, you figure, will be somewhat safer.

23:55.148 --> 23:59.794
Yes, it'll probably be as a staff officer working, you know, within a compound.

24:00.174 --> 24:05.240
As we talked about, I went all over Iraq, from Masouda to Qrit, to Fallujah to Ramadi, all over the country.

24:05.260 --> 24:05.901
I got to see it all.

24:06.281 --> 24:12.709
Whereas this next appointment as a staff officer, I'll probably just be in one building, have a 12-hour shift, you know, day in, day out.

24:13.450 --> 24:17.695
Very monotonous, but it still has its reason for being there.

24:17.715 --> 24:21.780
Besides being on reserve duty now as National Guard duty,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.027
Talk a little bit about that and also what you're doing.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.572
You're teaching over at Texas A&M.

24:25.593 --> 24:25.853
Yes, sir.

24:25.974 --> 24:27.298
You know, I have my National Guard duty.

24:27.338 --> 24:28.462
Actually, I have drill this weekend.

24:28.502 --> 24:34.622
I'll drive up to Abilene early Saturday morning after the basketball game.

24:34.855 --> 24:37.260
And we'll have, you know, we train for your wartime mission.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.723
That's what we do on the weekends.

24:38.743 --> 24:46.619
During the week, I'm a teacher, work over in the Kinesis department, teaching Kinesis 198s, 199s, health and fitness courses.

24:46.639 --> 24:47.521
I have 11 courses.

24:47.601 --> 24:52.712
Work Monday through Thursday, 8 to about 515, 530.

24:52.692 --> 24:58.684
That takes up a lot of time, it's my full time, but the thing is I take a lot of stuff from the military and apply it to my job.

24:58.965 --> 25:04.857
Make sure that, especially the physical fitness stuff, to give my students the best course they can have.

25:04.877 --> 25:08.304
A lot of them kind of say that they're expecting to have a blow off course.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.728
Some teachers just kind of let them come in and work out.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.975
I put them through the grinder, I take them out and roll around on the grass a little bit.

25:13.955 --> 25:16.659
Let them have a little fun and see what it's like.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.983
Ultimately, at the end of the semester, they like it.

25:19.123 --> 25:20.946
They're like, thanks for making me work.

25:21.006 --> 25:25.072
They lose a lot of weight, get in shape, and it makes me feel good.

25:25.092 --> 25:38.592
Mark, we have just about a minute, minute and a half left, and I don't want to drag you into getting too political on this, but I heard a story this morning, as a matter of fact, that in the month of November of 2008, there were seven American casualties in Iraq.

25:39.534 --> 25:41.076
Those are tragic, certainly.

25:41.697 --> 25:44.584
In November of 2007, there were nearly 30.

25:46.228 --> 25:47.391
Something's working over there.

25:48.273 --> 25:48.634
Definitely.

25:48.955 --> 25:54.930
I think General Petraeus, who I had a lot of involvement with during our mission, he had a good plan.

25:55.737 --> 25:57.519
I think it worked.

25:58.220 --> 26:12.775
I think insurgent forces are kind of learning their lesson and backing off and I think they're starting to try to focus on other areas and I believe that General Petraeus, General Ordiano and Secretary Gates have a great plan and I think they're in the right direction, definitely.

26:13.376 --> 26:14.777
Indeed.

26:14.797 --> 26:17.280
Good luck to you and thank you very much for your service.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.021
It's been a pleasure having you here.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.823
It was just a fascinating job.

26:20.843 --> 26:24.327
You got to be around a lot of interesting people and it's something that

26:24.307 --> 26:27.231
You will have a family someday, and you'll be able to tell them about it, right?

26:27.251 --> 26:27.631
Yes, sir.

26:27.652 --> 26:28.633
And show them all these pictures.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.535
Thank you for being here.

26:30.616 --> 26:32.358
Oh, thank you.

26:32.378 --> 26:38.566
It was indeed a multifaceted job providing security and planning in Iraq whenever a VIP visited.

26:38.586 --> 26:43.072
It's a job you don't hear much about, and that's exactly the way it's supposed to be.

26:43.092 --> 26:44.154
They're doing their job then.

26:44.194 --> 26:51.023
We salute and we thank Aggie grad Captain Mark White for his service then, now, and upon his future return to Iraq.

26:51.593 --> 26:52.594
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:52.975 --> 27:18.343
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:35.165 --> 27:45.506

27:46.007 --> 27:56.228
