00:12.535 --> 00:32.542
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.562 --> 00:33.683
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.355 --> 00:39.660
James Wade arrived in Europe when there was only two months of fighting left in World War II.

00:40.301 --> 00:52.433
But in that short time, plus the time that he spent there in occupational duty, he saw plenty of what you now read about in history books, including serving guard duty over the witnesses of the Nuremberg Trials.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.356
But the stories don't end there, so let's listen.

00:55.796 --> 00:59.440
Please welcome College Station's James Wade to Veterans of the Valley.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.623
James, it's an honor to know you, to meet you, and I'm glad to have you here.

01:02.907 --> 01:04.329
on Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.349 --> 01:11.796
When we call you College Station's James Wade, we really mean it because you were actually born about 300 yards from the house you live in right now.

01:11.917 --> 01:12.617
Yes, that's true.

01:12.858 --> 01:15.300
In College Station.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.003
Talk about College Station that long ago growing up.

01:18.023 --> 01:24.430
The only time you really spent out of College Station was nine years in Cameron and then your service in World War II.

01:24.530 --> 01:28.154
So what was College Station like back in the 20s and the 30s and such?

01:28.534 --> 01:31.277
It was just a small town.

01:31.544 --> 01:35.670
I remember when they were going to A&M, I could park anywhere on University Drive, I chose.

01:36.751 --> 01:38.574
And there just wasn't a lot of traffic around here.

01:38.614 --> 01:46.966
There's 5,000, the number was about 5,000 at that time, you know, enrolled in school.

01:47.146 --> 01:50.130
Right, it was small as compared to now, right?

01:50.150 --> 01:50.771
Oh, yes, yes.

01:51.432 --> 02:01.146
You entered the service late in 1944 after you had been at A&M, and you went over to Europe about, turns out, about two months before

02:01.430 --> 02:05.959
the war ended, but then you remained over there in occupational forces.

02:05.999 --> 02:09.545
Talk a little bit about sort of your entry into the Army.

02:09.565 --> 02:16.198
And at first you went to 105 Howartshire School, but then you got involved in communications as a telephone lineman.

02:16.478 --> 02:17.580
Sort of how did that all develop?

02:18.322 --> 02:22.189
Well, the basic training consisted of seven months

02:22.591 --> 02:36.258
105 Haracher training, and then the next 11 months was telephone linemen, you know, climbing poles and doing all the things that linemen do.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.184
Is that what they assigned you, or is that what you, did you want?

02:39.204 --> 02:40.406
No, that's what I was assigned.

02:40.847 --> 02:43.232
That's what I signed up for, and that's what I got.

02:43.432 --> 02:44.273
And that's what you got.

02:44.333 --> 02:48.038
So just about everything you learned about it, you learned in your basic training.

02:48.058 --> 02:48.459
Yes.

02:48.479 --> 02:50.662
And then a lot of on-the-job training, right?

02:50.682 --> 02:51.383
Yes, that's true.

02:51.603 --> 02:53.686
Let's talk about going over to Europe again.

02:53.726 --> 02:59.414
It was late in the war, late in 1944, and you were on the USS Queen Elizabeth, and it was jam-packed.

02:59.454 --> 03:00.055
Talk about that.

03:00.335 --> 03:01.417
Yes, it was.

03:01.777 --> 03:08.286
It was built for 2,300-plus people and 600 crew.

03:08.607 --> 03:08.747
Mm-hmm.

03:08.997 --> 03:13.985
And there was 22,000 of us that boarded there in New York that day.

03:15.027 --> 03:22.259
And of course, half of us had to sleep down below at night, one night, and then the next night we had to sleep up on deck.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.763
We traded off like that.

03:24.783 --> 03:26.005
Yeah, talk about overbooked.

03:26.286 --> 03:28.489
That was an overbooked ocean liner.

03:28.509 --> 03:28.690
Oh, yeah.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.152
But they let us all go, though.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.638
You said that one of the toughest parts, and it

03:34.208 --> 03:43.243
maybe a little indelicate to talk about, but you said that one of the toughest parts was chow because a lot of people were getting sick and it was kind of a messy ship going up and down those steps, right?

03:43.363 --> 03:43.623
Yes, yes.

03:44.405 --> 03:47.450
You just assumed to do without than make that trip down there.

03:49.052 --> 03:50.895
You could slip on stuff, right?

03:51.016 --> 03:51.697
Yes, right.

03:52.258 --> 04:00.351
Talk about what your job was really when you got over there and what duty you first went into and your outfit and sort of

04:00.770 --> 04:04.135
I know that you were sort of part of a recon group.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.177
Yes.

04:05.838 --> 04:07.380
Go into that in more detail.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.922
Sort of talk about what your job was over there.

04:09.042 --> 04:09.343
Okay.

04:10.204 --> 04:15.892
I was with C Battery, 924th Field Artillery Italian in the 99th Division.

04:17.315 --> 04:25.186
And I joined the outfit probably within a week after they had crossed the Rhine there at Remagen.

04:25.206 --> 04:29.072
And of course, I was assigned to this.

04:29.710 --> 04:32.411
And what we did, we did telephone work.

04:32.552 --> 04:35.232
All of our communications was telephone.

04:35.684 --> 04:40.732
The only radio was with forward observers.

04:40.932 --> 04:48.884
They could designate when and how far to send the rounds up when they were firing.

04:50.166 --> 05:01.202
A normal day, we got up first thing in the morning and loaded up with the battery commander.

05:01.182 --> 05:02.385
He's a driver.

05:03.327 --> 05:05.412
And then our wire truck.

05:06.274 --> 05:10.263
And then we went up and joined the infantry.

05:10.323 --> 05:11.345
That was the infantry.

05:11.906 --> 05:16.677
I think we were with the 394th Regiment.

05:17.264 --> 05:21.270
And our job was to support them with the characters.

05:22.011 --> 05:24.555
And so we got set up.

05:24.595 --> 05:26.238
We were assigned a location.

05:27.179 --> 05:31.206
And we got our guns all set up there.

05:32.067 --> 05:42.343
And by the time, of course, the wire was all set, we went up in order to string the wire and set up the telephones.

05:42.323 --> 05:48.232
But when the main body of the battery got there, we were ready to start firing just in a few minutes.

05:49.253 --> 05:49.353
Yeah.

05:49.373 --> 05:59.648
Well, people get an idea about this because you're just in raw country and you're setting up a telephone system in a matter of 15, 20 minutes, right?

05:59.668 --> 06:02.031
I mean, that was your job.

06:02.392 --> 06:03.133
And you had to find

06:03.535 --> 06:09.121
like huts or barns or someplace that was covered to put your switchboard so it would be protected from the weather, right?

06:09.141 --> 06:09.662
Correct.

06:09.722 --> 06:14.928
When we had to dig in out in the open, and then of course we had to use a tarp over the top.

06:15.669 --> 06:15.809
Yeah.

06:15.829 --> 06:20.994
I asked the other day, I said, you know, it certainly didn't all go right every time.

06:21.295 --> 06:30.505
There would be times where the communication would not be there and you'd have to go out and sort of find the problem, find the trouble, find what wire had been run over by a truck or something like that, right?

06:31.261 --> 06:32.643
So that was part of your job too?

06:32.663 --> 06:34.025
That was part of it, yes.

06:34.165 --> 06:36.668
Was repairman, is that right?

06:37.389 --> 06:42.095
And you said that when you moved locations, you left everything there, right?

06:42.115 --> 06:49.504
Yes, we left everything there, all the wire, and we just took the telephones loose and loaded them up and moved on out.

06:50.265 --> 06:52.288
And we didn't worry about picking up the wire.

06:52.308 --> 06:54.310
Yeah, so there's a lot of wire left over in here.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.152
Oh, yes, yes.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.533
Somewhere like that.

06:57.094 --> 07:00.238
Your story while over there, like we said, two months...

07:00.893 --> 07:05.217
you know, while the war was still being fought over there that you were, and then the occupational duty.

07:05.918 --> 07:10.322
But you have several stories, and I want to just sort of go ahead and go with them.

07:10.563 --> 07:19.051
And later on, we're going to talk about how in 2005, you were fortunate enough to go back over there sort of as a reunion trip.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.614
And a matter of fact, we have some photographs later on from that reunion.

07:23.255 --> 07:30.883
Talk about Bed Check Charlie and sort of what that involved and how that kind of still affects you now.

07:31.808 --> 07:37.918
Well, Bedchick Charlie had great respect of all the GIs over there.

07:39.160 --> 07:54.446
He was a single-engine light plane that flew over on dark nights real slow over the front lines, German plane, just seeking out some glimmer of light that he could call down artillery on.

07:55.588 --> 07:58.272
And so we respected him very highly.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.049
lights out.

08:00.069 --> 08:00.770
Yes, sir.

08:00.830 --> 08:06.298
Because he was hunting for any kind of glimmer of lights to do battle with.

08:07.019 --> 08:11.245
As I mentioned before, that's the only thing that I brought home with me.

08:12.226 --> 08:18.675
I can still be out at night, a light plane would fly over and it makes cold chills go down my back.

08:18.815 --> 08:23.762
Yeah, when you hear the low flying planes, even at your home.

08:23.862 --> 08:25.865
Yeah, right.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.208
The occupation after the war,

08:28.913 --> 08:39.803
One of the fascinating parts of your story, of your career, as we mentioned in the beginning, was that you were assigned guard duty, actually, to the witnesses of the Nuremberg trials.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.063
Yes.

08:40.884 --> 08:43.866
Talk about that part of the occupation duty that you had.

08:43.887 --> 08:44.847
Okay.

08:45.328 --> 08:47.129
I'm not sure how many witnesses we had.

08:47.189 --> 08:48.751
We had just scads of them.

08:49.552 --> 08:54.616
They came over every day in trucks and took them back to Nuremberg.

08:55.257 --> 08:57.739
And then, of course, at the end of the day, they brought them back.

08:58.782 --> 09:01.005
This was a Hirshbrook, right?

09:01.025 --> 09:01.907
This was a Hirshbrook.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.851
This was about 15 kilometers from Nuremberg.

09:05.191 --> 09:06.173
Right.

09:06.193 --> 09:22.977
And this was kind of a stressful time because, you know, they were civilians, but still they were the enemy, so to speak, or at least relatives of the enemies.

09:24.299 --> 09:26.342
And I remember on one occasion that I had to

09:26.795 --> 09:34.986
go down the back ranks and see that everybody was in their place when it was time to check the road, you might say.

09:35.767 --> 09:43.757
And that really gave you an eerie feeling down there by yourself, not having any weapon or anything, you know, had to leave that outside.

09:45.039 --> 09:47.181
It was just real eerie.

09:47.942 --> 09:48.803
Right, right.

09:48.823 --> 09:53.950
Did you know at the time what part of history you were involved

09:54.301 --> 09:57.044
And did you know much about the trials or what they were all about?

09:57.544 --> 09:58.525
I had no idea.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.105
No idea.

09:59.446 --> 10:08.214
The trials all developed from the time after the war was over with and we didn't get a lot of information as to what was going on.

10:08.234 --> 10:09.935
We just knew that there were trials going on.

10:10.076 --> 10:14.820
So you learned a lot about what you were doing later on in your life when you took history classes.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.180
More.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.321
That's right.

10:17.462 --> 10:20.265
I learned more later than I knew at that time.

10:20.285 --> 10:23.548
Than you knew at that time.

10:24.153 --> 10:29.946
The being called the assignment in Bamberg.

10:30.928 --> 10:40.891
This is a fascinating story and sort of the threesome that you were a part of, but actually there were obviously a lot of units like yours all through Germany doing the same thing.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.056
Talk about this assignment that I'm referring to.

10:43.238 --> 10:53.072
OK, we were notified that we would send three people up to Bamberg for some sort of mission.

10:53.412 --> 10:55.736
We had no idea what it was when we got there.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.720
So we took a Jeep, three of us was assigned to go.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.646
And so we took the Jeep and went up there.

11:02.666 --> 11:12.840
And then there was a meeting set up at 10 o'clock there in the city government.

11:12.820 --> 11:37.444
area there and so when we went in we were told that the first thing we were told that this was a top secret mission that we were that we were not to discuss it among ourselves the three of us that were together we were in three and threes we were not to even discuss it among ourselves you know and that uh that we would be given one name and an address

11:38.065 --> 11:45.116
and we would go out and pick up this individual and bring him back and turn him back in there at the location.

11:46.539 --> 11:53.610
And so, because this was to happen the day before, so the next morning this was to happen at 0600,

11:54.417 --> 11:57.381
a clock throughout all of Germany.

11:58.662 --> 12:02.567
And so at six o'clock, we were there knocking on the front door.

12:03.729 --> 12:14.982
And so we were admitted to the house by the lady of the house and just told her that we came to see Herr Schmidt or whatever his name really was.

12:15.824 --> 12:23.513
And so she called him, he came in and so we told him, you will get your clothes on and you will go with us.

12:25.130 --> 12:47.627
and he didn't did he resist at all no none whatsoever he kind of he kind of he was almost like he was expecting well i think maybe that was true yes and so he went back to his bedroom to dress and uh of course his wife and then two little girls about like five and seven uh came out and of course they were all crying and they were asking questions as to

12:48.097 --> 12:49.239
Where are you taking him to?

12:49.580 --> 12:50.762
How long is he going to be gone?

12:50.943 --> 12:51.844
When is he coming back?

12:51.965 --> 12:52.205
Sure.

12:52.486 --> 12:53.828
And all things like that, you know.

12:55.331 --> 12:57.516
The only thing we could say was, you know, we don't know.

12:58.117 --> 12:58.417
Right.

12:58.437 --> 13:01.844
And it was well that we didn't have any information, I think, you know.

13:01.864 --> 13:01.964
Yeah.

13:01.984 --> 13:04.890
But this is one of the hardest things I think I ever did to take

13:04.870 --> 13:07.635
the man away from his family.

13:07.655 --> 13:07.775
Right.

13:07.795 --> 13:08.957
They were all in tears.

13:08.977 --> 13:10.359
But they had a tearful goodbye.

13:11.381 --> 13:11.481
Yeah.

13:11.501 --> 13:14.366
And so I have no idea what happened.

13:14.947 --> 13:20.335
He may have wound up among the civilians there in Hirshbrook.

13:20.356 --> 13:20.856
I'm not sure.

13:21.157 --> 13:21.638
Right.

13:21.658 --> 13:22.259
Right.

13:22.379 --> 13:23.461
As a witness.

13:23.481 --> 13:24.022
As a witness.

13:24.122 --> 13:24.783
Could be, yes.

13:24.923 --> 13:25.825
As a witness.

13:26.265 --> 13:30.372
And you mentioned that it's your thought that probably by that time that the

13:31.550 --> 13:37.719
The German soldiers, the Nazis, may have already been round up, and this may have been a civilian worker or something like that.

13:38.400 --> 13:48.655
This was probably three weeks or a month after the war was over, and I'm sure that the Nazis were all rounded up before that happened.

13:48.675 --> 13:54.503
Do you recall about how long a trip was it from his home back to Bamberg?

13:55.664 --> 13:57.126
How long was it?

13:57.146 --> 14:01.733
Oh, it was in the same... It was clearly in Bamberg, within the same city.

14:02.034 --> 14:03.876
Oh, okay, so it wasn't a very long... No, no.

14:03.997 --> 14:06.040
Okay, it was... A couple miles or so, you know.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.964
Okay, so do you recall that couple of mile drive?

14:09.004 --> 14:10.086
Did he say anything?

14:10.186 --> 14:11.728
Did he... Didn't say a word.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.590
Just didn't say a word.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.793
He just... Couldn't have understood him anyway, I'm sure.

14:15.093 --> 14:15.614
Right, yeah.

14:15.634 --> 14:18.178
But no, he didn't make any remarks at all.

14:18.198 --> 14:19.380
Right.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.144
And the remarkable thing is that there were...

14:22.360 --> 14:36.825
several of these units like yours of three or four soldiers going out all at about 0600 doing the same thing that day and bringing them back.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.500
And it had to be top secret so that these people wouldn't run.

14:40.520 --> 14:47.946
Like they told us, you know, a word here and there that's picked up by a stranger or something could be put together.

14:48.147 --> 14:52.951
Could be put together and you could be chasing these people everywhere.

14:53.111 --> 14:53.831
Yeah.

14:54.512 --> 14:55.313
Incredible story.

14:55.493 --> 14:59.476
And like you said, this was happening all over Germany at the time.

14:59.496 --> 15:00.457
We've got some photographs.

15:00.477 --> 15:02.379
Let's go ahead and go to them right now.

15:02.439 --> 15:05.822
Some pictures from your career, an early part of your career.

15:05.842 --> 15:07.183
And this is really early.

15:07.163 --> 15:13.569
This is the 1941 A&M consolidated high school football team.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.611
Yes.

15:15.231 --> 15:16.673
Do you know which one you are in that picture?

15:16.873 --> 15:17.774
What your number was?

15:18.434 --> 15:21.998
I am third from the left without a number.

15:23.459 --> 15:24.020
In the front row?

15:24.040 --> 15:24.861
Yes, in the front row.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.282
Okay, I see third from the left.

15:26.963 --> 15:27.484
There you are.

15:28.525 --> 15:31.468
Does that mean that you were real good or weren't good enough to get a number or what?

15:31.708 --> 15:33.930
Well, I was still substituting.

15:34.332 --> 15:34.993
At that time.

15:35.033 --> 15:38.756
Didn't want to embarrass you there, but, you know, eventually you got a number, I'll bet, right?

15:38.776 --> 15:41.719
Yes, eventually I. Okay.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.743
There's your Army glam shot, as I like to call it.

15:46.004 --> 15:47.825
About how old were you in that picture?

15:48.566 --> 15:50.848
I was probably 20.

15:52.750 --> 15:57.735
I had just finished basic training, and this was on my furlough.

15:57.755 --> 15:59.277
I came home before I went overseas.

15:59.577 --> 15:59.837
Right.

16:01.098 --> 16:03.681
Right, and you had no idea what was ahead of you.

16:04.285 --> 16:05.668
I had no idea whatsoever.

16:05.908 --> 16:08.935
I had never been that far in my whole life.

16:09.997 --> 16:20.218
We talked about the Queen Elizabeth, and this is a picture of it, which was, I mean, by standards, it was a big boat.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.780
Next to the Queen Mary.

16:23.081 --> 16:23.301
Right.

16:23.321 --> 16:25.283
Queen Mary was the largest at that time.

16:25.363 --> 16:34.335
And that's good because like you said, and you can see there, if you can see the writing, it says 2,200, I believe in something, or 2,300 passengers it was built for.

16:35.176 --> 16:36.117
And you had some 22,000.

16:36.257 --> 16:37.579
Correct.

16:37.599 --> 16:38.159
On that boat.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.501
So they were sleeping everywhere.

16:39.521 --> 16:40.382
Oh, yeah, they were.

16:41.904 --> 16:43.146
Talk about these pictures.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.008
Describe the one on the left, Ian.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.639
That must have been made in New and Dettelsau.

16:48.839 --> 16:51.523
That was our first location after the ending of the war.

16:52.885 --> 17:01.839
We were stationed there for, oh, I think a couple months, and we pulled guard duty, roadblocks and things like that.

17:03.622 --> 17:08.309
And on the right, that's just another mugshot, I think, from the Army.

17:09.211 --> 17:10.873
Okay, let's move on.

17:10.893 --> 17:12.075
What have we got there on the left?

17:12.764 --> 17:21.214
Okay, I have a 30-30 carbine on my shoulder, and that's one of our heritages in the background there.

17:21.554 --> 17:21.775
Right.

17:22.395 --> 17:29.984
And I'm not sure, that may have been made at the time that we were, after the war was over, we were turning our equipment in.

17:30.485 --> 17:31.566
That's probably what it was.

17:32.067 --> 17:32.788
Right.

17:32.808 --> 17:39.075
And then on the right, that was made down at Garmish.

17:39.562 --> 17:46.270
This was our center, and a buddy of mine and I went down there for one weekend.

17:47.031 --> 17:49.474
And of course, there was lots of snow and so forth.

17:53.559 --> 18:01.148
You noticed that we were skiing on those small hills there, you know.

18:01.398 --> 18:30.780
but we had been up to the top and we rode a cog train up there and it was snowing just snowing to beat the band up there you know you couldn't see a thing and your hand in front of your face hardly but that was a real nice weekend we're going to talk about this in a moment we referred to it earlier in 2005 which would have been the 65th anniversary of the uh yes you uh you went on a reunion trip talk a little bit

18:31.317 --> 18:33.121
about that and what we're looking at there.

18:33.161 --> 18:37.429
That's the group in the top picture and then talk about that and then what we're looking at in the bottom picture.

18:37.830 --> 18:43.842
Okay, this was the tour that we made

18:44.311 --> 18:49.682
and we were over there at the 60th anniversary of VE Day.

18:49.923 --> 18:51.246
Right, 60th, right.

18:51.286 --> 19:01.527
Yeah, and so this was the veterans that went along, and we had a total of about 69 people, but the rest of them were family, family of the veterans.

19:01.507 --> 19:14.548
And we were out right there on Elsinborn Ridge, which much of the fighting was done during the Battle of the Bulge at that location.

19:15.609 --> 19:28.189
And in fact, there's two of those gentleman veterans that was at that very location during the time that there was one that had gotten

19:28.658 --> 19:31.602
gotten shrapnel, and he was out there.

19:31.902 --> 19:34.606
Of course, you can see how open it is.

19:34.966 --> 19:38.851
And then the Aldean forest starts right down the hill.

19:38.992 --> 19:40.774
Of course, it's all forest.

19:41.615 --> 19:47.262
And he was wounded one morning, and the medics could not get out to him.

19:48.284 --> 19:55.273
He had to lay in two feet of snow all day long before they were able to get out there on the cover of darkness to get him back in.

19:55.844 --> 19:59.527
You're in that top picture, I think you're in the front row, third from the right.

19:59.628 --> 20:01.709
I have light blue trousers on, yeah.

20:01.749 --> 20:02.310
Blue trousers.

20:02.931 --> 20:04.612
And now the bottom picture, talk about that.

20:05.053 --> 20:12.059
Okay, that was a monument that was donated by the Belgium people.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.403
And from here, I can't read any of the inscription on there.

20:16.443 --> 20:22.729
But anyway, it was thanking the 99th Division for their service in that area.

20:25.797 --> 20:30.542
That's quite a tribute to go over there.

20:31.363 --> 20:39.751
And this was during that reunion also as you were going through the force and you came upon, essentially that was a bunker right there.

20:39.771 --> 20:40.792
Yes, it was.

20:42.574 --> 20:49.020
Were you surprised to walk through and see remnants of war still in the terrain like that?

20:49.361 --> 20:52.223
Everything else was just lush green everywhere.

20:52.263 --> 20:55.787
Everything was rebuilt, but to find something like that had been left.

20:56.324 --> 21:01.691
For this 60 odd years, I was amazed to find it.

21:02.612 --> 21:03.954
Amazing.

21:03.974 --> 21:05.176
Some incredible pictures there.

21:05.737 --> 21:07.018
Indeed.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.422
There's more stories.

21:09.462 --> 21:23.240
Talk about, if you will, the duty that you had guarding an SS hospital and what really came about to be your first sort of hand-to-hand combat, although you didn't really realize it was going to turn into that.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.423
Talk about what happened then at the hospital.

21:25.443 --> 21:26.044
Well, there was...

21:26.311 --> 21:33.217
I was sent to the hospital as corporal of the guard and had four guards to go with me.

21:33.877 --> 21:42.345
And so we were guarding the four doors into the hospital, the front, back, and the two end doors.

21:42.365 --> 21:47.089
And this was in Aschaffenburg, Germany.

21:48.109 --> 21:48.230
Right.

21:48.250 --> 21:53.094
And so we had, I think we had the 12 to 8 shift.

21:53.914 --> 21:55.896
And so it was about 2 o'clock in the morning.

21:57.074 --> 22:00.118
I was in the office there.

22:00.138 --> 22:01.440
There was a loud knock at the door.

22:02.161 --> 22:03.704
And so I said, you know, come in.

22:04.805 --> 22:06.468
And the door flew open.

22:07.469 --> 22:17.343
And there stood an SS Trooper with nothing on but his shorts, with a knife in his left hand, bloody all over.

22:17.363 --> 22:26.136
He had slashed his forehead, his cheeks, his throat, his arms, his chest, stomach.

22:26.521 --> 22:33.013
All the way down, he had an awful little knife because he was just oozing blood.

22:33.213 --> 22:37.321
Nothing was flowing, but he was just oozing blood.

22:38.222 --> 22:43.672
And so, of course, the first thing I did was pull my .45 and I said, you get out of here.

22:43.693 --> 22:49.423
And he said, Shisham, Shisham.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.625
And so I knew then that he had started the job he couldn't finish.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.888
He wanted some help with it, you know.

22:56.908 --> 23:05.238
And so anyway, the first thought I had, though, was there was a blanket on the cot down that was standing beside.

23:05.979 --> 23:13.028
And I said, well, if I can get that, pick up that blanket, get it over his head, I might be able to take the knife away from him.

23:13.048 --> 23:18.595
And so I picked the blanket up, and so he charged me, and I threw the blanket up, and he stepped back.

23:19.276 --> 23:19.596
Well, he

23:20.048 --> 23:21.210
did the same thing again.

23:21.830 --> 23:26.797
The third time when he charged, well, he grabbed the blanket and jerked it out of my hands.

23:28.039 --> 23:38.293
And so I fired twice and one of the bullets got him in the left hip and he went slowly down to the floor.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.749
And so there was a little window there.

23:41.789 --> 23:44.413
I raised that window and I dived out head first.

23:44.433 --> 23:46.075
I was glad to get out of that place.

23:46.096 --> 23:48.079
That was a one-on-one battle that you won.

23:48.099 --> 23:49.661
He survived as far as you know.

23:49.681 --> 23:51.183
As far as I know.

23:51.283 --> 23:55.189
But it's just part of war that people don't think about.

23:55.610 --> 23:57.052
There's different kind of combat.

23:57.192 --> 23:58.695
We thought combat was all over with.

24:00.137 --> 24:01.880
You just thought combat was all over with.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.522
You talked about...

24:04.480 --> 24:05.681
We've got just a few minutes left.

24:05.701 --> 24:21.120
You talked about witnessing a convoy of prisoners, of German prisoners, I guess, when later in the war, after the war was over, and your recollection about that convoy and how long it was in the German prisoners.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.002
Okay, this was still during the war.

24:23.042 --> 24:23.763
During the war, right.

24:23.783 --> 24:29.430
This is following the surrender there at Ruhr Valley.

24:29.570 --> 24:29.830
Right.

24:30.215 --> 24:34.460
and where we helped capture 325,000 prisoners.

24:34.880 --> 24:43.249
And so they were trucking them off to some of the detention centers I'm sure that some of the Americans had been freed from, you know.

24:44.490 --> 24:52.499
And so as I remember, they was guarding this group, this convoy.

24:52.539 --> 24:59.226
There was a jeep with an officer and a driver and a machine gunner in the front.

24:59.982 --> 25:10.337
And 10 or 15 miles back, this convoy was followed by a jeep, an officer, a driver, and a machine gunner.

25:10.397 --> 25:13.061
This was all the guard that they had.

25:14.543 --> 25:16.987
But I'm sure they didn't want to go anywhere.

25:17.047 --> 25:19.651
They were ready for it to be over with.

25:19.951 --> 25:20.332
Indeed.

25:21.273 --> 25:26.360
It was just miles and miles of trucks with these prisoners, and they were ready.

25:26.420 --> 25:27.442
That was a sight to see.

25:27.562 --> 25:28.183
There's no doubt.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.543
There's no doubt about that.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.107
A couple of minutes left.

25:33.127 --> 25:33.909
You're discharged.

25:34.209 --> 25:36.974
You come back.

25:38.276 --> 25:40.119
You married Dorothy in 1946.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.328
You have two daughters, five grandchildren and a bunch of great grandchildren.

25:45.713 --> 25:47.317
I know you lost Dorothy in 2003.

25:47.798 --> 25:54.413
You have a special person in your life right now, a friend that you get to visit, and that's wonderful.

25:54.533 --> 25:56.477
And you're working.

25:56.497 --> 26:00.887
You're a working man who's working three days a week at Texas A&M.

26:01.373 --> 26:05.179
A lot of people your age are retired now, but you're still a working man.

26:05.199 --> 26:05.980
Talk about what you're doing.

26:06.020 --> 26:09.305
Well, I retired in 1988 from power line construction.

26:09.505 --> 26:10.186
Yes, sir.

26:10.206 --> 26:14.212
And I was off for three years, and I needed something to do.

26:14.232 --> 26:19.039
So a friend of mine was the director of GERG.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.326
And so I went over to see him, and he said, well, when I have something, I'll call you.

26:23.987 --> 26:26.911
And so he called me in a couple months, and I went to work.

26:26.951 --> 26:27.432
That was fantastic.

26:27.412 --> 26:28.614
15 years ago.

26:28.734 --> 26:33.241
I worked 10 years full-time and then now I'm working half-time.

26:33.682 --> 26:33.942
Right.

26:34.563 --> 26:39.871
And so you go to work, what, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays and still pull a paycheck.

26:39.911 --> 26:44.118
Yeah, and still have some of the nicest people to work for in the world.

26:44.258 --> 26:45.600
Really, I do.

26:45.900 --> 26:46.962
You obviously like doing it.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.965
I mean, it keeps you invigorated, right?

26:49.265 --> 26:49.866
Right.

26:50.147 --> 26:54.874
I'm doing the same thing now as I was when I first started working in the environmental lab.

26:55.155 --> 26:55.495
Yeah.

26:56.673 --> 26:57.374
That's incredible.

26:57.474 --> 26:58.975
That really is.

26:58.995 --> 27:04.059
And your two daughters, I believe, Terry is a schoolteacher in Lakey.

27:04.079 --> 27:04.319
Yes.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.781
And your other daughter, her name is?

27:06.061 --> 27:06.481
Locke.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.703
Locke, and she lives here in Bryan College Station.

27:08.723 --> 27:08.963
Yes.

27:09.484 --> 27:14.948
So you have family here, so you get to see family and keeping active, and that's just tremendous.

27:15.068 --> 27:19.192
But I hadn't told you before, on Tuesday night, we still have our family meal together.

27:19.472 --> 27:19.872
Wonderful.

27:19.892 --> 27:23.095
This has been going on 20 years, I guess.

27:24.076 --> 27:24.756
We're out of time.

27:24.837 --> 27:25.777
Thank you for your service.

27:25.797 --> 27:26.578
It's a great story.

27:27.048 --> 27:28.009
Thank you.

27:28.029 --> 27:35.940
Most men, certainly veterans, who were born in the 1920s are retired by now, but as you've heard, James Wade has a passion for everything that he does.

27:36.400 --> 27:46.233
Serving as a communications man in the European theater or fighting off a crazed German in self-defense combat are still today going to work three days a week and drawing a paycheck.

27:46.253 --> 27:52.081
Just as his two daughters, five grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren are proud of him, we are too.

27:52.101 --> 27:53.102
We salute James Wade.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.806
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
