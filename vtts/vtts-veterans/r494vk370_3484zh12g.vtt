00:20.045 --> 00:46.139
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:46.159 --> 00:47.200
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:48.142 --> 00:55.149
It was March of 1919 when about a thousand military men met in Paris for what was known as the Paris caucus.

00:55.169 --> 00:58.873
By the end of the meeting, they had a name, the American Legion.

00:58.893 --> 01:04.980
It had been the brainchild of about 20 officers serving overseas in the American Expeditionary Force in France.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.245
They had been charged with coming up with a way to improve troop morale.

01:10.265 --> 01:15.010
One young Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt suggested an organization for veterans.

01:15.412 --> 01:21.261
Well, today, the American Legion numbers nearly 3 million members in more than 15,000 posts worldwide.

01:21.902 --> 01:27.050
One of those posts, the Earl Graham Post 159 that serves the Brazos Valley.

01:27.070 --> 01:37.387
Its commander is Charles Opersteny, lifelong resident of Bryan and a veteran who served, among other places, at the old Bryan Air Force Base during the years of the Korean War.

01:37.407 --> 01:38.709
Charles Opersteny, welcome.

01:38.729 --> 01:42.094
It's a pleasure to have you and a chance to talk about the American Legion.

01:42.513 --> 01:44.155
First, I want to talk about your own service.

01:44.175 --> 01:52.964
I know that when you entered, you were down at Lackland, you were at Randolph Air Force Base, and eventually right back up here to your hometown and to Bryan Air Force Base.

01:52.984 --> 01:55.066
Sort of talk about those early years of your service.

01:56.067 --> 02:04.415
Well, took a couple of weeks of basic at Lackland, and then, of course, finished up my basic at Randolph.

02:05.716 --> 02:12.283
Since Randolph was a mother base of Bryan and furnished the cadre personnel, I was

02:12.449 --> 02:14.772
put on orders to come to Bryan.

02:15.574 --> 02:19.840
And of course, Bryan Field was pretty much desolate at that time.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.224
So we had a lot of rebuilding program to do.

02:23.465 --> 02:30.716
So I spent a lot of time doing carpentry work in the hospital so we could get it back up functioning again.

02:30.736 --> 02:30.937
Right.

02:30.957 --> 02:31.658
You were a medic.

02:31.998 --> 02:32.739
I was a medic.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.440
You were a medic.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.183
Bryan Air Force Base.

02:35.517 --> 02:39.845
you educated me, located out where the Riverside campus is right now.

02:40.206 --> 02:50.926
Bryan Air Force Base was quite active during World War II, but after the war ended 1944, 1945, it sort of shut down, but then got re-going again in the early 50s, just about the time that you arrived there.

02:51.287 --> 02:51.568
Is that right?

02:51.588 --> 02:51.928
Correct.

02:52.209 --> 02:52.409
Right.

02:52.850 --> 02:55.034
And talk about the base.

02:55.054 --> 02:57.559
I think a lot of people who have been here for a little while

02:57.978 --> 03:04.250
have heard of Bryan Field, Bryan Air Force Base, but they don't really know exactly what it was used for, a little bit of its history.

03:04.270 --> 03:05.533
It was mainly for pilot training.

03:05.573 --> 03:06.415
Talk more about that.

03:06.495 --> 03:10.603
It was, yes, it was reopened for pilot training at that time.

03:10.643 --> 03:17.657
They started out in T-28s, which was a propeller driven plane, had a tricycle landing gear.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.222
And after they apparently learned to land

03:20.658 --> 03:27.067
With the tricycle landing gear, then they moved up to the jet, which I think was the T-33, I believe.

03:28.028 --> 03:33.096
And then this was their final learning phase.

03:33.116 --> 03:38.363
And, of course, after that, then they were transferred to wherever the Air Force needed them.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.210
I guess flying jets and so forth and et cetera.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.412
You talked about the T-28.

03:43.452 --> 03:56.093
I know you talked one time about a crash out at the, when you were there, out at the Air Force Base that required some assistance, medical assistance that maybe Bryan Air Force Base was not prepared to give at the time.

03:56.154 --> 03:56.915
It was kind of hectic.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.798
At that particular time,

03:58.778 --> 04:24.634
weren't quite ready for flight status and unfortunately we did have a crash of a T28 and I was manually having to give traction to a person's head or neck because he had a fractured cervical vertebrae and

04:24.985 --> 04:25.646
Pretty hard to do.

04:25.686 --> 04:27.628
We didn't have the equipment to do these things.

04:27.649 --> 04:45.492
But fortunately, the C-47 came in from San Antonio and we were able to transfer both the pilot and the student to, I guess, Lackland or whatever hospital it had for the military there.

04:46.248 --> 04:50.495
You were at Bryan Air Force Base until about 1953, and then you were transferred to Newfoundland.

04:50.555 --> 04:54.301
Talk about where you went there and what your job was and what that was like.

04:54.722 --> 05:08.003
Again, I was a medic there, and I was at Pepperell Air Force Base, which was the headquarters for what is known at that time as the Northeast Command.

05:07.983 --> 05:13.956
I thought I was going to Tule, Greenland, which is above the Arctic Circle.

05:14.016 --> 05:27.325
They were opening up a hospital there, but somehow or another when the guy took out my Air Force identification code, he put me at Pepper, which I was very thankful for because

05:27.743 --> 05:30.627
This was a nice-sized hospital.

05:30.687 --> 05:36.575
We had essentially a physician of every specialty there.

05:37.116 --> 05:48.051
We had an orthopedic surgeon, psychiatrist, ear, nose, and throat man, orthopedic surgeon, a urologist, and on down the line.

05:48.172 --> 05:52.738
An x-ray or a doctor.

05:52.718 --> 05:56.266
radiologists, so we could take care.

05:56.346 --> 06:07.690
So people from that command, if they had problems at the smaller hospitals they could not take care of, they were then air back to our hospital, which in turn we took care of them.

06:08.092 --> 06:12.957
If we were able to get them back to duty again, they would go back to their duty station.

06:13.037 --> 06:15.580
If not, they would then transfer it back to the states.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.341
So you stayed pretty busy there.

06:17.742 --> 06:18.362
We were busy.

06:19.163 --> 06:23.528
I enjoyed the tour of duty there.

06:23.568 --> 06:25.309
It was nice and cool.

06:26.350 --> 06:31.956
The hospital, we had a softball team, a great softball team, so I enjoyed that.

06:32.256 --> 06:32.817
Indeed you did.

06:33.421 --> 06:40.304
And it was there, it was during this time that you personally became interested in physical therapy, which became your life's work.

06:40.384 --> 06:41.608
Talk about how that all came about.

06:41.825 --> 06:56.184
Well, being that the Air Force did, the medics or the corpsmen did the heat treatments and exercise and so forth for the patients.

06:56.524 --> 07:06.077
Of course, I became interested in physical therapy and my goal was when I got out of the service, I would finish up my college education.

07:06.378 --> 07:13.726
which I did at Sam Houston State and then applied and was accepted at Herman Hospital School of Physical Therapy.

07:13.826 --> 07:18.951
And I went there for a year and I enjoyed working with people.

07:19.292 --> 07:19.652
Indeed.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.575
Thoroughly enjoyed my work as physical therapist.

07:23.316 --> 07:26.680
And you actually made a career out of it, some 43 years?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.260
Correct.

07:27.421 --> 07:28.281
In Houston.

07:28.662 --> 07:32.866
A part of that time, I think you said a dozen years or so with the VA hospital, is that right?

07:32.986 --> 07:33.147
Correct.

07:33.167 --> 07:33.627
Is that right?

07:33.867 --> 07:35.389
Correct.

07:36.314 --> 07:42.446
What was, at that time, you attended A&M for a couple of years, is that right?

07:42.466 --> 07:43.348
Correct.

07:43.368 --> 07:44.330
What was the campus like?

07:44.350 --> 07:45.833
What was A&M like back then?

07:45.873 --> 07:50.341
I know you played baseball for Marty Corot, right, outside of Kyle Field.

07:50.362 --> 07:52.806
Well, the freshman coach was Mr. Anderson.

07:52.907 --> 07:53.147
Yes.

07:53.888 --> 07:58.778
And so I played freshman ball, did not play varsity ball.

07:59.534 --> 08:00.636
Wasn't quite good enough.

08:02.799 --> 08:09.209
But the campus was probably around six, close to 6,000.

08:09.829 --> 08:12.594
It was all male, so no girls.

08:16.059 --> 08:20.105
The campus now is so big, it's, you know, it's, I get lost on it.

08:20.385 --> 08:21.547
Right.

08:21.627 --> 08:28.157
You could go from Northgate over to Southgate on, I guess, Houston Avenue.

08:28.137 --> 08:30.142
You can't do that now.

08:32.327 --> 08:34.492
So the campus has really grown.

08:34.552 --> 08:40.266
The school has really grown and, of course, continues to be a great school.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.631
You grew up here in Bryan, over on the west side of Bryan.

08:42.671 --> 08:44.856
You're a proud Stephen F. Austin Brucco.

08:44.876 --> 08:45.538
Correct.

08:45.772 --> 08:50.742
This has been your home practically your whole life, except for those four decades that you were down in Houston.

08:51.143 --> 08:53.228
You weren't home, but you were close enough, right?

08:53.248 --> 08:54.871
Well, we came back quite frequently.

08:55.011 --> 08:55.973
I'll bet you did.

08:55.993 --> 08:59.260
21 years now, you personally have been a member of the American Legion.

09:00.242 --> 09:04.431
We're going to get specific about the American Legion, especially post 159 and talk about it.

09:04.451 --> 09:06.295
We're going to see some photographs later on.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.302
When you think about American Legion, obviously it's a passion of yours.

09:09.362 --> 09:10.223
What do you think about it?

09:10.243 --> 09:12.946
As far as obviously service is one of the first things that comes to mind.

09:12.966 --> 09:13.806
Well, it's service.

09:15.828 --> 09:17.270
Veterans helping veterans.

09:18.291 --> 09:33.765
And that's our primary goal is to help a veteran who has a problem to get him either into medical care or into rehabilitation or somehow help him financially if we possibly can.

09:33.785 --> 09:36.467
Or get him involved so he can have a job.

09:36.886 --> 09:52.026
again but our we want to help the veterans here locally we want to also help our youth we're into a program of Americanism which we we strongly push and of course under the Americanism

09:52.478 --> 09:59.047
We have the Boys State Program, which is a good program for kids to learn about government.

10:00.408 --> 10:04.954
They can learn about our local state government.

10:05.895 --> 10:09.100
We sponsor Boys Scouts.

10:10.081 --> 10:16.309
We also present medals to the high schools.

10:16.424 --> 10:25.578
and also the junior high schools for kids who push patriotism or citizenship.

10:26.359 --> 10:35.192
We also have an autorical contest, and this is a nice contest which we wish that we could get more young kids involved.

10:35.864 --> 10:43.762
Because if they win the state finals, there's a scholarship there.

10:43.902 --> 10:45.265
So they have some money coming.

10:45.325 --> 10:47.410
Then from there, they go to nationals.

10:47.795 --> 10:49.798
So they can end up with quite a bit of money.

10:50.199 --> 10:51.181
In scholarship, is that?

10:51.301 --> 10:52.703
In scholarship money, yes.

10:53.384 --> 10:53.645
Right.

10:53.665 --> 10:55.407
So these are programs that we push.

10:55.548 --> 11:00.976
And, of course, we consider ourselves as a family.

11:00.997 --> 11:08.689
And the family is the American Legion, the American Legion Auxiliary, as well as the sons of the American Legion.

11:08.669 --> 11:13.474
You all also, I know, have a very good relationship with the Veteran of Foreign Wars post.

11:13.574 --> 11:14.015
Correct.

11:14.035 --> 11:17.118
Many of their members are also your members, too.

11:17.138 --> 11:17.559
Correct.

11:17.839 --> 11:23.345
Explain to folks, as you explain to me, what the difference is in the two organizations, VFW and American Legion.

11:23.365 --> 11:32.635
The prime difference is the VFW, you have to have served in a foreign combat zone during a wartime period.

11:33.239 --> 11:41.008
The American Legion, we were incorporated by the Congress as a wartime veterans organization.

11:41.108 --> 11:47.875
So you could have served here in the States during the Korean War or World War II.

11:48.035 --> 11:50.718
Not everybody goes into a combat situation.

11:51.199 --> 11:55.304
You have to have support personnel to support those that are in combat.

11:55.324 --> 12:02.031
So anyone that was in the service during a combat period

12:02.399 --> 12:12.692
is eligible for the American Legion and certainly I would strive to encourage more veterans to belong to the American Legion or belong to a veterans organization.

12:14.615 --> 12:31.917
We only represent maybe not even 10% of the veterans of Brazos Valley and I understand we have 10,000 plus veterans in the Brazos Valley and we need these veterans to join so we can encourage

12:32.268 --> 12:34.971
legislation to help the veteran.

12:37.373 --> 12:43.359
In fact, the American Legion did file suit against the VA on Agent Orange.

12:43.740 --> 12:49.525
And at that particular time, the VA denied that Agent Orange had anything to do with health benefits.

12:50.126 --> 12:53.529
Well, fortunately, the American Legion won the case.

12:53.990 --> 12:59.035
And now we realize that those people that were in Vietnam during that time

12:59.285 --> 13:02.609
Agent Orange could have had an effect upon some of their health problems.

13:04.592 --> 13:06.995
About 800 members, 880 members.

13:07.015 --> 13:10.240
880 members is roughly what we have, yes.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.946
And you talked about that there's probably 10 to 12,000 maybe veterans in the Brazos Valley.

13:14.966 --> 13:18.691
And a lot of the reason for that, that there are so many is because of Texas A&M.

13:18.711 --> 13:20.474
So many old ags have come back here.

13:20.494 --> 13:20.854
Yes.

13:21.256 --> 13:21.597
Right.

13:21.817 --> 13:22.438
Correct.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.680
Exactly.

13:23.861 --> 13:24.962
You talked about Boys State.

13:25.864 --> 13:26.926
Talk a little bit more about that.

13:26.946 --> 13:33.577
That's just a fascinating organization that our program that I've heard of, but probably don't know enough about.

13:33.838 --> 13:35.320
And you all are one of the sponsors of this.

13:35.861 --> 13:36.162
Yes.

13:36.402 --> 13:39.227
I was so impressed.

13:39.247 --> 13:42.673
And I went down and these these kids, you know, it was.

13:43.058 --> 13:44.942
It was like two political parties.

13:44.962 --> 13:48.789
They divide up and they were sitting there fighting each other.

13:49.611 --> 13:57.707
It was fun to watch these kids actually toy with each other as far as their politics were concerned.

13:57.787 --> 14:04.240
And one of the things that I was so impressed with, we normally invite the kids before they go.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.404
And then they invite them after they've been to Boise State.

14:08.045 --> 14:09.387
And one kid came back.

14:09.407 --> 14:12.091
He said, well, I didn't really want to go.

14:12.111 --> 14:13.353
But he said, I went.

14:13.373 --> 14:17.018
And he says, not only did I go, but I try to run for everything.

14:17.779 --> 14:24.469
So he got totally involved in Boise State and really enjoyed it.

14:24.749 --> 14:26.271
That makes it all worth it right there.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.493
It was worth it, yes.

14:27.794 --> 14:34.503
We've got some photographs, photographs that I took when I visited out at the American Legion the other day and some old photographs that you supplied also.

14:34.623 --> 14:39.429
And we're going to go ahead and go to those photographs right now and let Charles Apperstini talk about them.

14:39.710 --> 14:40.731
You can look right over there.

14:40.751 --> 14:43.955
And that is a very young Boy Scout, Charles Apperstini.

14:44.516 --> 14:45.157
How old were you there?

14:45.177 --> 14:47.580
Do you have any idea?

14:47.600 --> 14:47.980
About 12?

14:48.001 --> 14:49.923
13, 13, something like that.

14:49.943 --> 14:50.684
It looks about that.

14:51.165 --> 14:52.807
Got that tie on.

14:53.568 --> 14:55.450
Got that hat cocked.

14:55.470 --> 14:56.772
You can tell that that man's going to be a...

14:57.663 --> 14:58.487
A man of service.

14:58.708 --> 14:59.633
A little bit older here.

14:59.653 --> 15:00.899
When was this picture taken?

15:00.939 --> 15:05.884
This was probably in 1951 or 1952.

15:06.404 --> 15:12.752
Probably 52 because it looks like I might have been an airman first class, which is three stripes.

15:12.772 --> 15:13.593
You're top right there.

15:14.074 --> 15:21.604
And this was nomination for, I think, a base airman.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.990
So I represented the hospital group.

15:26.590 --> 15:32.378
The others represented, you know, other branches of the Air Force there at Bryan Field.

15:33.202 --> 15:36.365
That was taken here in Bryan at the Air Force Base.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.106
Correct.

15:37.286 --> 15:41.450
You referred a little bit about the American Legion and that it sponsored a baseball team.

15:41.470 --> 15:46.015
Before you ever knew you were going to be a member of the American Legion, you played on the sponsored team, right?

15:46.075 --> 15:46.435
Correct.

15:46.996 --> 15:47.657
And that's your team.

15:47.677 --> 15:49.478
What year would this have been?

15:49.999 --> 15:54.804
This was probably 1947, I would think.

15:56.505 --> 15:59.108
And your top row is second from the right?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.109
Top row, second from the right.

16:01.129 --> 16:02.552
Right next to the coach, it looks like.

16:04.115 --> 16:08.164
This is a program that American Legion, we still continue to push.

16:08.184 --> 16:14.818
Unfortunately, we don't have the leadership now that we've had

16:15.237 --> 16:38.494
we've had people take advantage of our so our post does not sponsor a baseball team as of this date right but there are a lot of posts that do and it's I guess because we've had some with coaches I think some problems we have chose not to have one here

16:38.677 --> 16:41.722
I remember when I was working up in the Dallas area as a sports writer.

16:41.762 --> 16:46.831
Every summer, that's how we filled our sports pages was writing about American Legion high school baseball.

16:46.851 --> 16:48.013
It was great.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.657
Now, a lot of people are going to recognize some of these men.

16:50.818 --> 16:56.307
This is a ceremony where you awarded a 60-year recognition to the American Legion.

16:56.347 --> 16:57.810
Talk about who those folks are.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.955
Why don't you go from your course, knelt there in the middle,

17:01.559 --> 17:02.863
Who are these people left or right?

17:02.883 --> 17:04.108
A lot of recognizable faces.

17:04.128 --> 17:13.780
Okay, on the left in the red, there is Charles Stashney, whose father was a fireman for City of Bryan.

17:14.722 --> 17:19.869
In fact, at that time, he might have been the only paid fireman the city of Bryan had.

17:19.909 --> 17:22.472
It was an all-volunteer force at that time.

17:22.993 --> 17:24.815
But Charles has been in the American Legion.

17:24.855 --> 17:32.024
His father put him in, I guess, as soon as he went into the service, and he was in the Navy.

17:32.044 --> 17:43.058
The next gentleman with a tie on is Jack Zubik, and he was in the Army and also was in the National Guard here in Bryan.

17:43.730 --> 17:52.547
and his father, and he had a tailor shop out at College Station that made uniforms for Aggies.

17:53.188 --> 18:01.544
The next gentleman is Travis Bryan Jr., who has been quite an influential person here in the city of Bryan.

18:01.985 --> 18:03.848
I understand he was quite a golfer in his

18:04.317 --> 18:06.360
It still is, I think.

18:06.520 --> 18:18.760
And then the next person is Raymond Fickey, who is actually from the Curtin area, and he is in farming and ranching.

18:18.780 --> 18:27.253
And the very next person with the Legion cap on is Perry Shirley.

18:27.807 --> 18:33.023
He's a gentleman that I'm going to try to get on this show because you say he has quite a story of service.

18:33.163 --> 18:41.749
Yes, he was involved in a lot of combat in Italy, and it would be nice if you had him on the program.

18:42.269 --> 18:44.893
I think he received a couple of Purple Hearts.

18:45.133 --> 18:51.743
In fact, I think when he was discharged, he might have been discharged with 100% disability.

18:51.883 --> 18:52.464
Yes, sir.

18:52.484 --> 18:53.625
But that didn't stop him.

18:53.665 --> 18:56.329
He went back to work for the City National Bank, I believe.

18:56.950 --> 18:59.013
If you're watching, Mr. Shirley, I'll be giving you a call.

18:59.053 --> 19:00.335
We want to get you on the show.

19:00.355 --> 19:05.442
And the person to the right is our adjutant, Don Simons, who...

19:05.945 --> 19:10.659
at one time was our department commander here in the state of Texas.

19:10.679 --> 19:12.665
He's a very knowledgeable person.

19:13.989 --> 19:14.892
He was involved

19:15.530 --> 19:22.682
Here at KAMU, I believe, with their sports program for R.C.

19:22.702 --> 19:23.523
Slocum.

19:23.543 --> 19:23.744
Right.

19:24.244 --> 19:25.326
And, of course, Nealon.

19:25.346 --> 19:28.471
A technical advisor to this show, as a matter of fact, also.

19:28.491 --> 19:29.253
A very good man.

19:29.353 --> 19:30.334
We appreciate it, Tom.

19:30.595 --> 19:30.855
Right.

19:31.616 --> 19:33.419
And, of course, Nealon is myself.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.601
Right, right.

19:34.621 --> 19:35.863
This is the outside of your post.

19:36.144 --> 19:39.850
People that are not familiar with it, it's located out off of Highway 5.

19:40.218 --> 19:46.812
21, just west of the bypass at the intersection of Waco there.

19:46.832 --> 19:50.720
This is a shot, I think, of your auxiliary meeting room.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.323
Of the auxiliary room, correct.

19:52.363 --> 19:52.704
Right.

19:52.724 --> 19:56.071
And the auxiliary, of course, is for spouses of American Legion members.

19:57.635 --> 19:58.817
And what are we looking at there?

19:59.033 --> 20:03.478
This is the commanders and the president.

20:03.898 --> 20:12.128
I've forgotten which is which, but one is presidents of the auxiliary, the other is the commanders of our post.

20:12.188 --> 20:14.550
I'm not sure.

20:14.771 --> 20:18.555
They're recognized on... Recognized the past president.

20:18.835 --> 20:25.162
That's a case that's there in the auxiliary room with some artifacts of the American Legion.

20:25.623 --> 20:26.003
Correct.

20:28.463 --> 20:30.085
Okay, we'll move on to the next picture.

20:30.466 --> 20:35.152
You sell stuff, and you also have photographs of some of your legionnaires up there.

20:35.172 --> 20:36.033
So what are we looking at there?

20:36.053 --> 20:47.027
Well, the top row up there is the past commanders of our post all the way back to 1920 or whenever.

20:48.709 --> 20:57.981
The post, I think, started in 1920 and dropped out for a year or two, according to Mr. Simons, but then started back up.

20:58.501 --> 21:01.625
And I want to say, that's just a few of the pictures.

21:01.805 --> 21:04.389
It goes all the way around the room.

21:04.409 --> 21:10.537
Also underneath those cases that we saw before, things that you all sell, hats, American Legion hats and pins and whatnot.

21:10.798 --> 21:17.807
This is your, you're very proud of this trophy case right out in your opening lobby.

21:17.827 --> 21:18.989
What was in there?

21:19.009 --> 21:23.635
We're very proud that we've had two department commanders from our post.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.719
And we have a division commander

21:27.290 --> 21:38.224
and a couple of district commanders, which is district is the immediate higher up from the post and then you have division and then of course you have department.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.769
I think Don Simon's picture was in there and wasn't he a historian?

21:41.789 --> 21:43.130
He was like a state historian?

21:43.150 --> 21:44.732
He was a national historian.

21:44.772 --> 21:46.435
Yes, he was a national historian.

21:46.735 --> 21:49.338
I want to stay on this picture a while because this is Earl Graham.

21:49.358 --> 21:50.440
Talk about Earl Graham.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.441
Who was Earl Graham?

21:51.640 --> 22:00.148
Well, Earl Graham was an early, well, he was in World War I and

22:00.702 --> 22:06.670
Our post is named after him, and he is buried in the Bryan City Cemetery.

22:08.252 --> 22:22.349
And normally posts are named after someone, and so our forefathers chose to name the post after him.

22:22.369 --> 22:26.895
World War I veteran, and his photograph is well...

22:26.875 --> 22:51.938
prominently displayed as it should be okay we'll move on to the next picture this I thought this was fascinating you took me out to the back of your place and you have a patio out there that you have activities with a big barbecue pit there in the back and you use this a lot but you want to invite other organizations or parties whatever to come in and rent this out right sure we would welcome

22:52.458 --> 22:55.381
As you can see that it's a lot of space and everybody's looking for space.

22:55.421 --> 23:02.508
So contact the American Legion and you can use this for your own party, for your own function.

23:02.948 --> 23:09.515
Since we're on the patio, I would like to mention that on Flag Day, we do have a flag retirement ceremony.

23:09.555 --> 23:19.905
So anyone who has a tattered flag, American flag, that they would like for it to be disposed of properly can bring it to our post.

23:19.925 --> 23:22.127
We have a little box or a little...

23:22.630 --> 23:24.515
stay in a box that you can put it in.

23:25.498 --> 23:32.797
And on Flag Day, we will have a ceremony to properly dispose of or retire the American flag.

23:32.817 --> 23:34.301
And you have it there on your back patio.

23:34.361 --> 23:37.770
And that's just a fascinating place.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.155
You talked about veterans helping veterans, and that's what you do.

23:40.175 --> 23:48.333
And you do everything you can to help another veteran with who gets in problems, financial problems, whether it be rent, utilities.

23:48.353 --> 23:50.318
And you try to the best of your ability to do that.

23:50.338 --> 23:53.384
But you want people to understand you do not get any government subsidy.

23:53.404 --> 23:55.489
That is correct.

23:55.469 --> 23:59.954
Last year, we gave out around $2,600.

24:00.294 --> 24:11.487
Of course, that is money that we have to come up with ourselves, and we don't mind helping the veterans that need help.

24:11.987 --> 24:12.868
That's what we're for.

24:13.029 --> 24:13.749
But this is your money.

24:13.769 --> 24:19.836
This is money that you get from dues and your fundraising activities and such like this.

24:21.037 --> 24:24.261
You also have honor guards.

24:24.815 --> 24:31.547
that at the request of a family with a veteran who passes for their funeral service, you will give a 21 gun salute.

24:32.348 --> 24:36.395
Talk about that service that you provide because I know it's very meaningful to families.

24:36.576 --> 24:42.486
We're very proud of our honor guard and for some elderly

24:42.466 --> 24:47.091
We have a lot of World War II veterans in there, so we're talking about someone who's up in age.

24:47.672 --> 24:49.053
Also, our Korean.

24:50.154 --> 24:57.022
We have a white shirt uniform with dark pants.

24:57.262 --> 25:01.607
And we do provide military funerals for families that would like to have.

25:01.747 --> 25:10.296
And so far, since we're starting up our honor guard again, we have been to over 100

25:10.782 --> 25:20.216
funerals where we have provided a 21-gun salute, present the flag to the family member, and also play taps.

25:20.236 --> 25:28.468
We talked about your close relationship with the VFW earlier, and that really comes to light at two specific days during the year, Veterans Day and Memorial Day.

25:28.808 --> 25:30.170
That's when you all get together.

25:30.210 --> 25:37.080
Instead of having two separate ceremonies, I guess you alternate having ceremonies on those days with the VFW?

25:37.441 --> 25:37.701
Yes.

25:38.238 --> 25:41.741
The days, like this year, we had Memorial Day.

25:41.781 --> 25:49.127
Next year, the VFW will have, excuse me, we had Veterans Day this year at our post.

25:49.568 --> 25:57.395
Next year, they'll have Veterans Day at their post, and we'll have Memorial Day at our post this coming year.

25:57.795 --> 26:01.018
But yes, it's a joint program, and we do work together very closely.

26:01.038 --> 26:07.063
And I know the commander of the VFW, Rick Alavarez, and we're good friends.

26:07.702 --> 26:08.083
Indeed.

26:08.303 --> 26:10.046
We've had him on the show, as a matter of fact.

26:10.848 --> 26:17.721
Organizations like the American Legion, like the VFW, you can even go into organizations like Lions Club, Kiwanis Club, whatever.

26:18.382 --> 26:23.331
They're simply not going to survive unless there's new blood there, unless there's new members, young, old.

26:23.648 --> 26:32.577
And I know that in just our last minute here, you would like to tell folks, folks that are veterans to please consider joining an organization like American Legion.

26:32.597 --> 26:33.278
By all means.

26:33.378 --> 26:40.665
And I realize that this is a busy time of life for all of us.

26:40.685 --> 26:45.370
And I grant you that you say, well, I can join, but I couldn't come.

26:45.390 --> 26:47.231
But to me, it's very important that you join.

26:47.352 --> 26:49.774
I joined and I never did go when I was young.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.923
I was like a lot of young people.

26:51.963 --> 26:56.608
I was busy working, trying to make a living for my wife and my children.

26:57.429 --> 27:04.357
But to me, it's important to belong so we have numbers.

27:04.377 --> 27:06.219
Congress will listen to numbers.

27:06.840 --> 27:18.192
And if we can have numbers, as I said, it was nice that we were able to now point out that Agent Orange did create health problems.

27:18.172 --> 27:21.175
And we need to keep the VA hospitals open.

27:21.195 --> 27:26.320
So if with numbers, hopefully we can impress Congress.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.441
And the American Legion will do that.

27:27.461 --> 27:28.582
Charles Opersteny, thank you.

27:28.602 --> 27:29.203
We're out of time.

27:29.223 --> 27:30.384
Appreciate you being here.

27:30.404 --> 27:31.125
Thank you very much.

27:31.585 --> 27:41.135
It is imperative that if such service organizations as the American Legion or the VFW or the Lions or Kiwanis Clubs are going to sustain themselves, that new members come under their wings.

27:41.255 --> 27:42.596
Involvement is the key.

27:42.616 --> 27:44.618
And thanks to men like Charles Opersteny,

27:44.598 --> 27:47.402
The American Legion does stand strong in our community.

27:47.422 --> 27:52.169
Certainly, you've heard of the American Legion, and now you know more about them, and that was our purpose here.

27:52.189 --> 27:57.818
Thanks to Charles Opersteny for his service, and thanks to all veterans, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.220
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.864
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
