00:07.709 --> 00:27.051
Thank you.

00:29.242 --> 00:30.764
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.104 --> 00:32.766
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.786 --> 00:38.834
Colonel Ty Newton of College Station spent 10 of his 30 years in the Air Force teaching and flying at the Air Force Academy.

00:39.295 --> 00:43.420
That was in two tours, divided by a tour of Vietnam, where he flew C-130s.

00:43.861 --> 00:49.748
His love for teaching and flying laid the path of his military career that might have otherwise been a pro baseball career.

00:49.728 --> 00:53.634
It's a pleasure to introduce Colonel Ty Newton and welcome him to Veterans of the Valley.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.336
Indeed, Ty, welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.079
Let's talk about your career.

00:57.139 --> 01:02.527
30 years in the Air Force, but before that, you were born in Hickory, Tennessee, home of Andrew Jackson, I understand.

01:02.888 --> 01:06.233
I want to talk about the baseball end of it because you were a baseball player.

01:06.253 --> 01:07.975
You went to Baylor on a baseball scholarship.

01:08.015 --> 01:08.316
That's right.

01:08.336 --> 01:13.884
So I want to talk about that part of your early career and then how that became a decision rather to go into the military.

01:14.185 --> 01:16.528
Okay, going back to high school,

01:16.508 --> 01:25.982
I was in Rising, Arkansas, which was about 65 miles south of Little Rock, and played football, basketball, ran track.

01:26.002 --> 01:34.315
They didn't have a baseball team, but we played baseball out in the field during the summer, and between my junior and senior year in high school,

01:34.295 --> 01:39.684
I went away for the summer to play American Legion ball in Camden, Arkansas.

01:40.305 --> 01:45.514
We had a pretty good team, went to the state championships and did quite well.

01:45.534 --> 01:52.185
And then after graduating from high school, I went to Louisiana and played semi-pro ball down there.

01:52.165 --> 02:03.795
and they had some scouts there and apparently one of the scouts knew the Baylor head baseball coach and he came over to see us play in the playoffs and offered me a four-year scholarship.

02:03.815 --> 02:07.164
This is in August before school started in September.

02:07.184 --> 02:09.229
So I was pretty fortunate.

02:09.209 --> 02:16.119
So I entered Baylor in the fall of 1949, had four wonderful years there, played ball.

02:16.139 --> 02:23.529
And in the summer we played out at Alpine, Texas, a chance to get to play during the summer months.

02:23.649 --> 02:29.057
And we had a team made up of mostly Southwest Conference players, but some other schools also.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.784
And that's where I met my good friend Tom Chandler and his wife Willardine.

02:33.285 --> 02:36.348
And we remained good friends all those years.

02:36.368 --> 02:38.070
And we had a good team.

02:38.150 --> 02:45.279
We won the state championship in semi-pro ball a couple of years and went to the national championships in Wichita, Kansas.

02:45.980 --> 02:51.366
And we also had a chance to play some pretty good teams that included some major league teams.

02:51.346 --> 02:54.671
players during the Vietnam War, they were drafted.

02:54.711 --> 02:56.675
The Korean War, they were drafted.

02:57.556 --> 02:58.838
Who were some of those?

02:58.858 --> 03:00.961
Bob Turley, who pitched for the Yankees.

03:01.643 --> 03:04.026
Bobby Brown, who played third base for the Yankees.

03:04.547 --> 03:07.732
A little later, Don Newcomb, who pitched for the Dodgers.

03:08.874 --> 03:13.101
For an 18-year-old kid, that was quite an experience to get a chance to do that.

03:13.081 --> 03:19.532
Indeed, as a matter of fact, you went on, you got a chance to play in the Chicago Cub organization, played in Macon, Georgia, is that right?

03:19.552 --> 03:20.053
Macon, Georgia, yes.

03:20.073 --> 03:22.597
Yeah, and you met up with some pretty good ball players there too.

03:23.038 --> 03:26.844
Met up with a young fellow that had a fairly good career named Hank Aaron.

03:26.864 --> 03:27.506
Yeah.

03:27.526 --> 03:30.851
And he played in that league as a second baseman for Jacksonville.

03:30.992 --> 03:31.292
Right.

03:31.272 --> 03:37.400
and went on to the Braves the next year, in fact, and then played in the outfield.

03:38.221 --> 03:46.472
And after that, I went back to Baylor to work on my Masters the next fall.

03:47.193 --> 03:51.018
And my wife and I got married that winter.

03:51.359 --> 03:54.383
She was teaching school at Marlin, teaching physical education.

03:55.184 --> 03:59.710
And the next spring, I got my...

03:59.690 --> 04:08.907
contract from the cub organization and about the same time i got a little letter from the air force saying uh welcome aboard we'd like to have you and uh

04:09.342 --> 04:22.779
I had gone through ROTC, but I had what they call a delayed deferment because the Korean War had ended and they weren't needing as many people then, so I didn't think I'd ever go in.

04:23.259 --> 04:25.202
So I didn't go to summer camp or anything.

04:25.242 --> 04:31.189
But when I got these orders, I had to then go to summer camp and get ready to go into the Air Force.

04:31.870 --> 04:37.257
So I did that, came back to school the next fall and completed my master's.

04:37.237 --> 04:41.072
and then went into the Air Force the next June of 1955.

04:41.092 --> 04:45.930
In 1955, and you knew from the beginning that you wanted to fly, right?

04:46.079 --> 04:49.606
Yes, I was pilot qualified and I didn't have any choice.

04:49.626 --> 04:51.690
They said you go to pilot train.

04:51.710 --> 04:55.718
I didn't really know what I was getting into, but I loved it.

04:55.738 --> 04:57.020
I really enjoyed flying.

04:57.120 --> 05:08.442
Went to Hondo, Texas, flew the T-6 there and then went from there on out to Lubbock where I flew the B-25 and enjoyed that and I was

05:08.422 --> 05:11.549
supposed to stay there and be an instructor pilot.

05:11.569 --> 05:17.302
I found out that six months later they were going to transition into jets and no longer have the B-25s.

05:18.585 --> 05:26.262
And since I graduated high enough in the class to get my first choice, I decided to go somewhere else because I wanted to stay in the multi-engines.

05:26.275 --> 05:26.676
Indeed.

05:26.696 --> 05:30.084
You went to Waco as a first assignment as an instructor pilot.

05:30.144 --> 05:36.018
And then when your hitch was up, you had a decision to make, whether you were going to stay military or go back and try baseball.

05:36.038 --> 05:39.627
Sort of talk about what you and Ruth decided and talked about and did.

05:39.742 --> 05:43.386
Well, we talked about the pros and cons.

05:43.726 --> 05:47.129
We knew pretty much what the military had to offer.

05:47.370 --> 05:48.531
There was some security.

05:48.971 --> 05:53.676
You weren't going to get rich, but you weren't going to starve, and you had your health benefits.

05:53.816 --> 05:57.420
And also, we talked about the possibility of war.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.645
We knew that that was a possibility, and if we decided to stay, that was part of it, and we'd do it.

06:03.245 --> 06:06.829
So we knew that baseball was an iffy thing.

06:06.809 --> 06:08.933
And I enjoyed flying so much.

06:09.053 --> 06:15.084
And about that same time, I got an offer to go teach at the Air Force Academy, and that helped make the decision.

06:15.104 --> 06:16.767
So we decided to stay.

06:18.289 --> 06:19.892
Talk about the Air Force Academy.

06:19.932 --> 06:23.599
Like we said, you spent 10 of your 30-year career at the Air Force Academy.

06:23.619 --> 06:26.304
Obviously, this is an institution that's very important to you.

06:26.364 --> 06:29.830
You had a chance to go there in your first tour and sort of what you did there.

06:29.962 --> 06:35.591
It went there as a first lieutenant teaching physiology, and that was the early days of the Air Force Academy.

06:35.891 --> 06:37.694
They still had leaks in the buildings.

06:37.774 --> 06:40.298
We had garbage cans sitting around catching the water.

06:40.899 --> 06:50.093
The framework of the chapel, which people know probably more than anything else, the chapel was just a frame then.

06:50.153 --> 06:51.615
We didn't have the...

06:51.595 --> 07:16.877
the aluminum on the spires or anything so we got there early on but we had a wonderful tour it was a great family place because the the facilities were great and they had elementary and high school right there on the academy site so in fact two of our kids started the first grade there and graduated from high school at the Air Force Academy Wow and we

07:16.857 --> 07:25.288
As we got toward the end of that tour, five years worth, things were heating up in Vietnam.

07:25.308 --> 07:31.056
So I volunteered for a flying assignment and they put us in C-130s.

07:32.357 --> 07:37.184
And I think we had the best of all worlds because we got transferred to Okinawa.

07:37.644 --> 07:39.727
So the entire family got to go.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.530
We had three children at this time.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.113
First one was born when we were at Hondo.

07:44.093 --> 07:48.186
the second one at Waco, and the third one while we were at the Air Force Academy.

07:48.206 --> 07:56.652
So we all packed up and headed for Okinawa, and the family lived on Okinawa while I was flying every month down in Vietnam.

07:56.767 --> 08:00.133
I want to back up a second back to when you were at Waco.

08:00.654 --> 08:08.587
Towards the end of that tour in 1959, you said you had a chance to fly a distinguished gentleman around Texas for a little while.

08:08.607 --> 08:09.168
Talk about that.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.432
Yeah, that was quite an adventure.

08:12.033 --> 08:20.186
I was a first lieutenant, and the operations officer came in one day and said, would you like to take a VIP around on a speaking tour?

08:20.206 --> 08:22.470
And I said, well, yeah, I'd be glad to.

08:22.450 --> 08:23.251
Who is it?

08:23.571 --> 08:24.993
He said it's Lyndon Johnson.

08:25.494 --> 08:42.936
So we went out to the plane and here came, this was before he became vice president, the year before he became vice president, but Lyndon Johnson, his wife, his secretary, and two or three other people, I guess publicity people, were there.

08:43.657 --> 08:51.006
And we took off and flew around east and north Texas and he made little speeches here and there.

08:50.986 --> 08:54.290
We came back and landed in Austin and let him out.

08:54.310 --> 08:58.876
He wanted to go to his ranch, but the weather was so bad we couldn't get in there.

08:59.937 --> 09:04.923
So we had to land in Austin and he wasn't too happy about that.

09:04.943 --> 09:14.254
Yeah, I understand that he was a demanding person and of course an aggressive personality like a lot of people remember him and I guess you remember him that way also.

09:14.274 --> 09:16.437
That's exactly right.

09:16.417 --> 09:21.766
It was kind of crude and wasn't too respectful of a people, as I recall.

09:21.927 --> 09:22.868
Right, right.

09:22.888 --> 09:27.116
But it's still something that you certainly remember as he became President of the United States.

09:27.617 --> 09:35.531
Summer of 1960, you did go to the Air Force Academy, and like you said, it was a wonderful assignment because you got to have your family there, and you taught chemistry and physiology.

09:35.551 --> 09:36.633
I taught physiology.

09:36.653 --> 09:38.636
It was in the chemistry and physiology department.

09:39.077 --> 09:40.720
They were combined at that time.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.843
And we offered some other courses.

09:42.944 --> 09:45.968
Everybody, all the cadets had to take physiology.

09:46.008 --> 09:53.941
We offered a few other courses to prepare those who wanted to go to medical school, the background so they could go.

09:54.722 --> 10:01.813
It was not a full-fledged pre-med program at this time, but some of the people took those courses on their own.

10:02.131 --> 10:27.615
got into medical school and went through medical school and then back to the Air Force right but you never got to stop flying and I thought this was interesting you went on to Vietnam and then you came back to the Air Force Academy we'll get back to Vietnam in a minute but I believe in your second tour of the Air Force Academy when you were teaching there you got to fly and you even flew med students around to their interviews at medical schools is that right that's right yeah we got to

10:27.595 --> 10:30.558
We had to get our flying time and this was one way of doing it.

10:30.598 --> 10:38.265
The cadets needed to go for their medical interviews and we had one particular place where we took a lot of cadets and that was down at Tulane.

10:38.826 --> 10:48.455
Dr. Jim Knight was the Dean of Admissions down there and he really liked the cadets because they had such a wonderful background academically.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.819
They had no trouble in medical school and he said, I'll take all you can give us.

10:52.839 --> 10:56.202
So we got to know him quite well

10:56.182 --> 11:14.103
And that played a role in coming to A&M really because my good friend Bill Ward was in the department there and he stayed at the academy while I was in Vietnam and we got to know Jim Knight on the second tour, not the first tour.

11:14.864 --> 11:17.667
And we'll get to that after Vietnam.

11:17.731 --> 11:27.159
C-130, a very versatile airplane, a very important airplane, not only to the Vietnam War, but it's still being used today in Iraq.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.422
Talk about the C-130 and what you liked about it.

11:29.902 --> 11:32.444
Well, it was a versatile plane, as you say.

11:33.265 --> 11:43.754
Not only carried supplies, but it carried troops, and they jumped out of the 130 parachuting, and it also served as a flare-drop plane.

11:43.774 --> 11:47.738
We would drop flares on targets in Vietnam, and the fighter strikes

11:47.718 --> 11:50.483
would come in and wipe out the target.

11:50.503 --> 12:08.393
Also, we had some that were equipped as gunships, and they were the old AC-130s that had a 105mm cannon in the back, a howitzer, a 40mm cannon, a 20mm minigun, and a 7.2mm gun.

12:08.373 --> 12:13.600
When you got all those firing at the same time, it put down quite a layer of fire.

12:13.620 --> 12:14.421
Right.

12:14.441 --> 12:18.527
You are a member of a group here locally called the BSA, the Been Shot At group.

12:19.528 --> 12:29.842
Talk a little bit more about Vietnam and some of the adventures, I guess, as it were, that obviously it got pretty exciting, if that's the right word from time to time.

12:30.162 --> 12:34.448
It did, but I had it so much better than a lot of other people.

12:34.732 --> 12:44.728
As I've mentioned, the people down on the ground in the jungles and the people flying helicopters and the people flying over Hanoi every day had it a lot worse than we did.

12:44.788 --> 12:47.212
But we had some exciting experiences.

12:47.272 --> 12:56.166
I flew just the plain old troop carrier supply plane, C-130, for the first year over there.

12:56.186 --> 13:00.874
And then our ops officer came around one day and said, would you like to...

13:00.854 --> 13:04.357
start flying some special classified missions.

13:04.377 --> 13:06.740
And I said, well, tell me a little about it.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.101
What does this entail?

13:08.121 --> 13:13.366
And he said, I can't tell you until you volunteer to do it and sign some papers.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.429
And so I thought about that a little bit.

13:16.469 --> 13:18.592
And I said, well, OK, let's give it a shot.

13:18.652 --> 13:30.203
So after we went through the preliminaries, the first thing he said, your first job is to go into Laos with a little roller and measure all of the

13:30.183 --> 13:46.229
air strips over there and that's using the term pretty loosely because they were just dirt places that people, the Air America was flying in there but they were going in in small planes but they wanted to see if we could get in there with the bigger planes.

13:46.249 --> 13:51.938
So two other guys and I went over and marked off all the airfields, took pictures and

13:51.918 --> 13:58.006
and found out which ones we thought we could make it in safely and out of safely.

13:58.727 --> 14:13.285
And so that started it and then we found out that we would be flying in civilian clothes and flying unmarked silver airplanes instead of the camouflaged Air Force planes that we'd been flying.

14:13.265 --> 14:17.829
it turned into something quite different from what we've been flying before.

14:19.471 --> 14:25.717
In the late 50s and early 60s Laos was about to lose its neutrality.

14:26.417 --> 14:30.581
The North Vietnamese were in there being supplied by the Russians.

14:30.601 --> 14:39.610
We had some Americans in there trying to keep things balanced out a little bit and at the same time there was a

14:39.674 --> 14:43.983
peace agreement accord going on in Geneva, Switzerland.

14:44.624 --> 14:54.325
Averill Harriman was the lead negotiator for us over there and it was between the Russians and the Chinese and the Laotians and the Vietnamese and Thailand.

14:54.524 --> 15:18.895
countries involved and so they finally reached a settlement in 1962 and the settlement said that Savannah Fuma who was a neutralist would be head of Laos and his cabinet would be made up of the three factions, the communists, the neutralists and the royalists and that was kind of a recipe for failure to start with.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.517
At least it was a try.

15:21.157 --> 15:24.661
And they also said all military troops had to leave.

15:25.441 --> 15:29.646
Well, we took our six or seven hundred military troops out of there.

15:29.666 --> 15:37.894
The North Vietnamese took fifty of their troops out through the checkpoint, leaving five to seven thousand still in Laos.

15:38.714 --> 15:42.538
So that presented a problem, how to neutralize that.

15:42.558 --> 15:48.544
And the way we did it was through flying civilians and civilian planes in there trying to

15:48.676 --> 15:53.824
supply and train the Laotians to combat these North Vietnamese troops.

15:54.184 --> 15:59.692
So if they weren't going to play by the rules, we weren't going to play by the rules, but we were going to do it more undercover.

15:59.712 --> 16:00.093
That's right.

16:00.473 --> 16:02.076
The Russians knew what we were doing.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.558
We knew what they were doing.

16:03.979 --> 16:07.844
Neither one wanted to squeal on the other because we were both breaking the rules.

16:08.285 --> 16:11.089
And so we just winked and kept doing it.

16:11.069 --> 16:28.369
indeed well let's go to some photographs we've got just a few uh pictures that uh that you've supplied to us also a picture of that c-130 and i want to go ahead and go to those now and have you uh comment on them here's a uh young uh ty newton when was this taken oh this was in 1955 when i was in pre-flight training uh

16:28.602 --> 16:31.926
down at Lackland Air Force Base before starting pilot training.

16:31.946 --> 16:32.687
There you go.

16:32.707 --> 16:34.670
I hardly recognize that guy.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.512
Good looking soldier there.

16:36.532 --> 16:37.473
Indeed.

16:37.493 --> 16:42.039
This next photograph, this is a photograph that I found on the internet actually of the C-130.

16:42.059 --> 16:42.820
That's quite a burden.

16:43.341 --> 16:43.741
It is.

16:44.182 --> 16:57.799
And the one that we were flying as the gunship had the guns out the left side that you see there and it flew in a circular orbit around the target and fired everything into the target area.

16:59.281 --> 16:59.601
Wow.

17:00.622 --> 17:01.403
Great airplane.

17:01.423 --> 17:02.965
And like we said, it's still being used today.

17:03.545 --> 17:11.113
We haven't talked about this yet, but later in your military career, you actually spent some time in England, just about 85 miles from London.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.674
And this is a picture that's taken then.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.498
That's you down the bottom left, standing at the base of the steps.

17:16.518 --> 17:18.620
And who's that VIP you're greeting there?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.682
Well, that fellow is Prince Charles.

17:20.722 --> 17:28.410
He came up to Milton Hall one day to dedicate the stained glass windows in the chapel.

17:28.745 --> 17:34.738
And our wife and I and some others had a chance to visit with him in small groups, 10 to 15 minutes at a time.

17:34.818 --> 17:42.535
And then he came onto our plane and we gave him a briefing about the mission that we were flying over there.

17:42.835 --> 17:44.758
So this was in the 1980s, is that right?

17:44.778 --> 17:47.181
That's right, in the early 1980s.

17:47.201 --> 17:48.703
Early 1980s.

17:50.526 --> 17:52.969
So he's about in his early 30s then.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.631
Yeah, I think so.

17:54.652 --> 17:58.717
This is your family, who we'll talk about later, but why don't you tell us who those folks are?

17:58.737 --> 18:02.683
Yeah, this was on my day of retirement in San Antonio.

18:02.843 --> 18:04.585
This was out in front of our house.

18:05.206 --> 18:08.311
On the right, there's our oldest son, Mike, and his wife, Debbie.

18:08.952 --> 18:11.475
And behind Debbie...

18:11.978 --> 18:26.528
is Kathy, which is our youngest son, who's standing just to the left of me there, Gary, and then that's my wife Ruth there, and then our daughter Shea and her husband Mike, and they live in Austin,

18:26.710 --> 18:31.277
Gary and Kathy live in San Antonio, Mike and Debbie live here in College Station.

18:31.297 --> 18:33.960
So that picture's a little over 20 years old though, right?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.002
That's right, it is.

18:35.022 --> 18:35.783
Because you retired in 1985.

18:35.863 --> 18:38.587
That was made in August of 1985.

18:38.647 --> 18:39.108
Right.

18:40.249 --> 18:40.790
Great pictures.

18:41.331 --> 18:47.019
November of 75, 10 years before you retired, you received an assignment to Thailand as a squadron commander.

18:47.199 --> 18:48.902
That didn't last very long, but talk about that.

18:49.022 --> 18:49.583
No, it didn't.

18:49.723 --> 18:51.165
I was...

18:51.145 --> 19:06.059
I had been at the Academy for five years again on my second tour and I was ready to get back into the cockpit, so I requested flying and they put me into the new 130 gunship, which is an H model, all computerized, really a wonderful plane to fly.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.268
And I went through two months of training to go back into that.

19:10.754 --> 19:14.681
got over to Karat, Thailand in November of 1975.

19:16.204 --> 19:22.996
About two weeks later, they announced the closing of the base that was going to occur about six months later.

19:24.078 --> 19:31.311
And so we were wondering what in the world we were going to do there for the next few months, besides play tennis and a few things like that.

19:31.291 --> 19:39.966
And then about two weeks after that, I got a promotion to Colonel, and that was a Lieutenant Colonel's job there.

19:39.986 --> 19:41.488
So they said, you can't stay here.

19:42.510 --> 19:43.532
You're overqualified.

19:43.552 --> 19:44.053
That's right.

19:44.093 --> 19:48.500
So after about six weeks, I was back in, or two months, I was back in the States.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.325
And I was sent to San Antonio to be a

19:51.305 --> 19:56.475
division chief of a research job down there at Brooks Air Force Base.

19:56.655 --> 19:57.357
Right.

19:57.377 --> 20:05.172
Then you got an assignment that I know you and your family really enjoyed, going to Mildenhall, England, which is about 65 miles from London.

20:05.212 --> 20:07.716
Talk about what your job was there and what you did.

20:07.736 --> 20:09.600
That was a wonderful assignment.

20:09.766 --> 20:13.472
It was a job, a joint service job.

20:13.532 --> 20:17.379
We had the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force there.

20:18.360 --> 20:23.268
And I was the Air Force battle staff commander on the European Airborne Command Post.

20:23.289 --> 20:34.407
And we had a team, a battle staff team, on alert, or airborne, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because things were still hot between us and the Russians.

20:34.387 --> 20:48.314
The Cold War was still going, of course, and so we were on alert and flying in order to disseminate orders from the President of the United States in case of a nuclear attack.

20:48.896 --> 20:53.745
So if the headquarters were knocked out someplace or

20:53.725 --> 20:59.936
If the president was disabled, we had alternative means of getting orders also.

20:59.956 --> 21:07.548
So we were there to disseminate those orders to the NATO troops or whoever needed the information.

21:07.568 --> 21:15.582
And we got to meet some wonderful people there, got to meet some good civilians in England that we

21:15.562 --> 21:17.986
still maintain the contact with.

21:18.026 --> 21:25.099
They come to visit us every couple years and we go over there and visit them and so it's been a wonderful experience.

21:25.139 --> 21:25.720
That's wonderful.

21:25.740 --> 21:28.024
You spent three years there then back to San Antonio.

21:28.084 --> 21:34.115
You retired on a Friday I guess in 1985 and the next Monday you went to work for your new job at Texas A&M.

21:34.135 --> 21:34.636
That's right.

21:34.656 --> 21:36.680
Talk about your service to A&M for 11 years.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.042
I retired all weekend.

21:38.022 --> 21:38.664
Right.

21:38.684 --> 21:39.546
Went to A&M.

21:39.746 --> 21:44.758
And again, that was a result of our connections previously.

21:44.878 --> 21:53.719
Bill Ward, who had been at the Air Force Academy, went to work for Jim Knight, who was the first dean of the medical school in Texas A&M.

21:53.699 --> 22:02.816
And so he retired after 20 years, and I spent another 10 years, and he said, well, we probably have a job for you when you retire from the Air Force.

22:02.836 --> 22:03.798
And sure enough, they did.

22:03.858 --> 22:12.754
So I went to work in the Office of Student Affairs and Admissions at the medical school, director of student financial aid initially.

22:12.734 --> 22:22.062
Worked there for 11 years and got to do some of the things that we'd been doing at the Air Force Academy, dealing with medical students this time instead of pre-med students.

22:22.563 --> 22:32.592
But we also got to go around to all the schools here in Texas and brief them about the medical school program, talking to the pre-med students.

22:32.672 --> 22:34.954
So that was a fun job.

22:35.074 --> 22:41.019
And we've enjoyed living here in this area because we had friends here before we came here.

22:41.039 --> 22:42.741
And, of course, now we have many more.

22:42.721 --> 22:45.724
And we've been here longer than we've ever been anyplace.

22:46.345 --> 22:49.208
So I guess our roots are pretty well established here.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.450
You and your wife, Ruth, have been married for 53 years.

22:51.510 --> 22:53.873
I know you have three children and six grandkids.

22:53.953 --> 22:56.395
Talk about your children, where they are, who they are.

22:56.715 --> 22:57.696
Let you brag on your family.

22:57.837 --> 22:58.377
All right.

22:58.397 --> 22:59.218
All right.

22:59.238 --> 23:06.906
Well, we were married, as I mentioned before, when I was still at Baylor working on my master's degree, and she was teaching school.

23:06.886 --> 23:12.132
And we had our kids on the first three assignments that we had.

23:12.953 --> 23:15.216
And they got to follow us around.

23:15.316 --> 23:27.269
And when we were in the Far East on Okinawa, one of the things that they got to do that most people don't get to do, they got to fly on military aircraft since it was called an isolated assignment.

23:27.830 --> 23:33.957
So when I'd come back and we'd take leave, we'd all hop on a plane and head to Bangkok or

23:33.937 --> 23:37.982
or the Philippines or Japan or Hong Kong or someplace.

23:38.963 --> 23:42.768
And so, in fact, Ruth got to land in Saigon.

23:42.848 --> 23:49.096
We were flying on a plane to Bangkok one time and the plane landed in Saigon during the middle of the war.

23:49.376 --> 23:49.837
Oh my goodness.

23:49.857 --> 23:51.459
Fighters taking off and everything.

23:51.879 --> 23:54.122
We landed, refueled and took off.

23:54.102 --> 24:09.462
So, after we left the Air Force Academy then and went to San Antonio, Mike, our oldest son, had gone to Baylor one year, then he came to

24:09.442 --> 24:12.607
to A&M, so he was in Texas.

24:12.627 --> 24:24.847
Our daughter then went to Baylor and finished up there, and our youngest son went through tech school at Waco, and so they all remained in Texas.

24:25.027 --> 24:31.277
They thought they were Coloradians before we came down here, but they all ended up staying in Texas.

24:31.798 --> 24:36.225
Our oldest son is here with our oldest grandson.

24:36.205 --> 24:43.553
Our daughter lives in Austin, and she has a daughter and two children, two sons.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.174
Now, you mentioned your son Mike's name.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.696
What's your daughter and your other son's name?

24:47.316 --> 24:48.938
Shea is the one in Austin.

24:49.038 --> 24:49.939
Don't want to get you in trouble.

24:50.620 --> 25:00.109
Shea is the one in Austin, and her oldest daughter is a freshman at the University of Texas this year, and she has two sons there.

25:00.149 --> 25:02.652
One of them is Sam.

25:02.632 --> 25:09.165
a junior in high school, and Ben is in the sixth grade, and he's 12 years old.

25:09.707 --> 25:20.168
And then Gary and his wife Kathy live in San Antonio, and their children are Meg, who's 12, and Colette, who will be seven next month.

25:20.148 --> 25:20.869
You're doing good.

25:21.070 --> 25:23.334
I think we've got all six grandkids in there, too.

25:23.354 --> 25:25.537
Yeah, and we enjoy seeing them.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.082
In fact, we went this past weekend to Austin.

25:28.422 --> 25:35.034
We've been doing the Capital 10K for the last 20-some-odd years kind of as a family, and we look forward to that.

25:36.717 --> 25:37.939
Some of us used to run it.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.527
We now walk it, but some of them still run it.

25:42.507 --> 25:43.349
Well, that's better.

25:43.389 --> 25:49.219
Most families get together and just, you know, have a bucket of fried chicken, but at least you all get together and do something healthy.

25:49.259 --> 25:50.722
You all get together and run.

25:51.103 --> 25:52.966
That's wonderful.

25:53.127 --> 25:57.455
You still have Air Force Academy reunion every couple of years, too.

25:57.475 --> 25:58.396
I know that's important to you.

25:58.416 --> 26:04.768
Every two years, we get together someplace, and this coming summer, we're going to have it back at the Air Force Academy.

26:04.748 --> 26:07.553
We do it there about over four or five years.

26:08.855 --> 26:16.567
Two years ago we met at Annapolis for the Annapolis Air Force football game and had our reunion there.

26:16.587 --> 26:19.713
So we get together and renew our acquaintance.

26:21.115 --> 26:26.584
Our numbers are getting a little smaller, but still most of the people have come.

26:27.325 --> 26:30.891
The gentleman that was our

26:30.871 --> 26:32.574
department head back then.

26:32.674 --> 26:37.102
He's in his mid to high 80s now and still very active.

26:37.503 --> 26:44.275
He was a real sportsman and he played halfback on the Missouri football team.

26:44.335 --> 26:48.443
I'll never forget when I went to the Air Force Academy for my interview.

26:48.563 --> 26:49.825
He was the one who interviewed me.

26:50.935 --> 27:02.751
And I don't remember him asking me anything about my academic background, but he asked me what my bowling average was, if I played squash, and if I played golf.

27:02.771 --> 27:04.273
Ty Newton, we're out of time, but thank you.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.837
It's been a pleasure having you here, and thank you for your service.

27:06.857 --> 27:16.470
Colonel Ty Newton counts himself fortunate to have spent three decades serving our country and being able to share much of that service with his family in such faraway assignments.

27:16.490 --> 27:17.772
We thank him for his service.

27:17.792 --> 27:20.115
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
