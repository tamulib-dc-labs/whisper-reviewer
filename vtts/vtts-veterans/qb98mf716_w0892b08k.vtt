00:00.031 --> 00:28.367
My citizens.

00:30.305 --> 00:32.268
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.288 --> 00:33.389
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:34.211 --> 00:41.722
General Ted Hopgood's 31-year career in the Marine Corps was followed by six years as Commandant of Cadets at Texas A&M.

00:42.363 --> 00:46.629
And over the next two Veterans of the Valley shows, we'll cover as much as we can.

00:46.709 --> 00:50.895
But still, it can't properly tell the story of where he's been and what he's seen.

00:51.331 --> 00:57.521
Three tours of Vietnam, the first one, the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, Kilo Company, on the ground in combat.

00:57.541 --> 01:00.205
One of his earliest battles was the most intense.

01:00.906 --> 01:08.298
His recollections of his career are vivid, especially his time in the National Military Command Center during the start of Operation Desert Storm.

01:08.779 --> 01:11.243
Please welcome General Ted Hopgood to Veterans of the Valley.

01:11.624 --> 01:15.109
General Hopgood, it is indeed an honor to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:15.129 --> 01:17.473
Been wanting to have you on the show for a long, long time.

01:17.757 --> 01:24.223
You grew up in North Dakota, cold up there, I know, but eventually you made your way to Texas A&M.

01:24.243 --> 01:25.124
It wasn't your first choice.

01:25.144 --> 01:28.808
Your first choice was the Naval Academy, but you're glad you ended up in Aggieland, right?

01:28.828 --> 01:29.769
Delighted.

01:29.789 --> 01:40.939
I came to Texas A&M after the people at the Naval Academy said, perhaps you need to wait another year because high school was a lot of fun and so forth.

01:40.999 --> 01:44.743
But Texas A&M just was a fit, I thought, from the very first day.

01:45.365 --> 01:46.106
Came here in 1961.

01:46.406 --> 01:53.255
You graduated in 1965 and then started what would be a 31-year career in the Marines.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.277
You were sent to Quantico.

01:54.297 --> 02:00.125
You were there for six months, and you were one of the ones who was designated for immediate deployment to Vietnam.

02:00.145 --> 02:03.048
Talk about Quantico and how that immediate deployment came about.

02:03.068 --> 02:12.621
Well, it's true now, as it was then, that all Marine officers, regardless if their specialty is going to be fighter, pilot, helicopters, or infantry, which I was,

02:13.310 --> 02:16.975
go to Quantico for six months upon being commissioned.

02:17.656 --> 02:18.958
So we're all trained together.

02:18.978 --> 02:23.124
We're all imbued with the same thoughts and ideals of the Marine Corps.

02:23.145 --> 02:25.228
And in my class, we had double companies.

02:25.248 --> 02:35.483
We had 587 lieutenants and 17 of us were infantry officers that went straight from graduation December of 1965 straight to Vietnam.

02:35.543 --> 02:36.364
And I was one of those

02:36.513 --> 02:38.997
17, so I guess you could say as one of the chosen.

02:39.017 --> 02:49.011
Right, and now four of the 17 were infantry officers who went over together and sadly two did not survive, but you and another one did.

02:49.051 --> 02:50.674
So talk about that.

02:50.854 --> 02:55.821
I remember the flight over there was four of us infantry officers on the same flight

02:55.902 --> 03:00.628
And two of us survived, and the other one that survived is a good friend.

03:00.668 --> 03:04.432
He's a retired major general aviator after one tour underground in Vietnam.

03:05.053 --> 03:09.278
The other two went to different units and, sadly, were killed in action.

03:09.399 --> 03:16.327
But our battalion, the one that my friend and I went to, was 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, and it was a great battalion.

03:16.347 --> 03:17.268
I can say that now.

03:17.909 --> 03:24.357
I know it was good at the time, but after a career in the Marine Corps and an ample time to reflect, I know it was a great battalion.

03:24.893 --> 03:25.874
You were still a young man.

03:25.935 --> 03:30.842
You were not even a year out of college then, and here you were, you were heading to Vietnam.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.344
What do you remember your thoughts then?

03:32.364 --> 03:33.266
Were you frightened?

03:34.227 --> 03:35.970
You know, I don't think so.

03:36.070 --> 03:46.986
It's 21 years old, on your way to war, and, you know, on the way over there, you meet people who are coming back, so they, of course, embellish their stories.

03:47.422 --> 03:55.113
Throughout my time in the Marine Corps, whether it was officer or enlisted, I thought that the training and the preparation was first rate.

03:55.954 --> 04:03.285
And while I guess everybody encounters situations that are new and unusual, I never felt confused.

04:03.325 --> 04:08.152
And perhaps because I never felt confused, maybe that did a little bit to boost my courage up.

04:08.352 --> 04:16.163
Certainly there were many scary moments, but I guess we were so busy and trying to do the right thing that perhaps they've faded in the back of my mind.

04:16.227 --> 04:19.601
You were a 2nd Lieutenant, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, Kilo Company.

04:19.641 --> 04:20.545
Talk about that outfit.

04:21.207 --> 04:25.967
Well, Kilo Company was commanded by several very...

04:26.572 --> 04:30.115
Great captains, I will say that without reservation.

04:30.335 --> 04:35.019
We had two, and during the time I was there, we had two Marines that were awarded the Medal of Honor.

04:36.020 --> 04:41.104
All of my squad leaders in my platoon were at least Silver Star, if not Navy Cross winners.

04:41.785 --> 04:44.307
We sought out the enemy.

04:44.327 --> 04:51.713
In fact, as I recall, in fact, my whole career, I never had to look back to see if I was being followed.

04:51.733 --> 04:56.157
My men were always with me, and most times they were out in front of me

04:56.643 --> 04:59.006
pushing the attack, if you will.

04:59.026 --> 05:13.682
You know, the Marine Corps is wonderfully unique in the fact that it attracts young men and women, but young men who want to attack and fight and be part of something that's bigger than them.

05:13.822 --> 05:19.189
You know, we don't recruit in dropouts from monasteries.

05:19.249 --> 05:20.490
We go after the

05:20.892 --> 05:43.525
the kids from the Bronx, if you will, from East L.A., from the south side of Chicago, and the rugged kids from the small towns all over America, and they come in the Marine Corps, and the Marine Corps takes what's best with each of these individuals and give them what's best with the Marine Corps, and you turn out a superb Marine and a superb fighter for our country.

05:44.230 --> 05:51.680
You spent 13 months in your first tour from February of 66 to March of 67, 11 months as a platoon commander.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.205
I want you to talk about, and you were on the ground that time, in ground combat.

05:55.225 --> 05:56.947
I want you to talk about J.J.

05:57.007 --> 05:59.691
Carroll and tell me about him.

05:59.711 --> 06:08.222
And then I want you to fast forward like you did with me the other day and talk about your trip not too many years ago to Notre Dame for a football game and sort of how those two stories mesh.

06:08.703 --> 06:09.704
Well, J.J.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.807
Carroll was a...

06:12.361 --> 06:13.683
Notre Dame athlete.

06:13.723 --> 06:20.973
He went to Notre Dame as a diver, ended up playing on the football team, and he was our company commander for a month.

06:21.213 --> 06:30.425
He lasted a very arduous, difficult, combat-filled month before he was unfortunately killed in action.

06:30.445 --> 06:37.575
And I remember he was just bigger than life, as you would say, and I can recall under the

06:38.602 --> 06:59.287
Poncho at night a few times with the rain coming down and him drinking coffee and me drinking my always ready hot chocolate at the time of discussing his time when he played at Notre Dame and my time being in the Corps and being supportive of part of the 12th man and exchanging stories and his stories were just spellbinding.

06:59.307 --> 07:03.192
In fact, one of his favorites was he was fighting hard

07:03.982 --> 07:12.012
to make the traveling squad near the end of the, must have been the 56 or 57 season because Notre Dame was going out to LA to play Southern California.

07:12.053 --> 07:15.797
And this was the days when it's not, you know, it wasn't modern times, if you will.

07:15.857 --> 07:22.206
So Hollywood and Los Angeles had this great attraction and he was just trying like everything he could to make the, make the team.

07:22.246 --> 07:33.921
So they had an indoor practice facility and some names of the first Notre Dame first teamers was Myron Patios and Nick Petrosani and Al Equay, all, all Americans and,

07:34.660 --> 07:36.382
followed on to play in the NFL.

07:36.743 --> 07:41.510
And he remembers going through, and they didn't have their pads on, going through and tackling the quarterback.

07:41.750 --> 07:51.103
And the first teamers took out retribution on the next play, and he said he woke up on Saturday morning in the Notre Dame infirmary listening to the game on the radio.

07:51.143 --> 07:54.388
So he didn't make the trip, and I guess he came out wiser.

07:54.408 --> 08:02.119
But anyway, as you said, to fast forward, when I was working at A&M and the Aggies played in South Bend,

08:02.842 --> 08:08.473
And my wife and I, along with a group of maybe 10 or 12 others, traveled with the Aggie band to Notre Dame.

08:09.355 --> 08:14.906
And as the Aggie band always does before the game, they run through their routine for that game.

08:14.926 --> 08:18.634
And at Notre Dame, as in several places, you can't get on the actual field.

08:18.654 --> 08:22.842
So we were inside this building, and I could...

08:23.142 --> 08:31.334
I just knew it was the place because there was pictures up on the wall of All-Americans, and you could see some of the literature from practices in football.

08:31.354 --> 08:34.318
So I knew that's where the football team was working out.

08:34.338 --> 08:51.082
And when we were standing in a position to watch the Aggie band play the music and march like only the Aggie band could do, the goose bumps up and down my spine, knowing that that was the place where my former company commander, the Notre Dame football player, had spent some of his time.

08:51.162 --> 08:51.563
It was a

08:52.268 --> 08:54.531
A rare moment in my life and one I'll always remember.

08:55.833 --> 08:59.038
There was a lot of action, especially in July of 1966.

08:59.218 --> 09:01.842
I want you to talk about the operation at Hastings.

09:01.902 --> 09:05.247
It turned out to be one of the most attempts that you would experience in your three tours.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.649
Well, yes.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.414
Operation Hastings was July 1966.

09:09.554 --> 09:15.463
It was the first real incursion, if you will, of the Marine Corps.

09:15.923 --> 09:16.604
In fact, U.S.

09:16.624 --> 09:21.111
forces into the area just below the demilitarized zone of Vietnam.

09:22.002 --> 09:30.615
And after a preparation by B-52s to clear out some landing areas, we went in there straight in on helicopters.

09:30.635 --> 09:37.726
And the place where we landed became known as the Helicopter Valley because three got shot down.

09:37.746 --> 09:45.057
And I remember getting off the helicopter and immediately going to ground with my nose was about six inches off the ground.

09:45.077 --> 09:45.698
And I looked up.

09:46.505 --> 09:56.378
And in front of me were body parts from Marines that had unfortunately been cut up, running into the helicopter blades because the helicopters had crashed there.

09:57.339 --> 10:07.032
And for about 10 days, we were really under the gun with attacking North Vietnamese that were extremely aggressive, competent soldiers.

10:07.052 --> 10:10.437
And we were operating with only three companies vice our normal four.

10:10.973 --> 10:13.556
and it was 24 hours a day.

10:13.596 --> 10:28.956
At night we had flare ships up and gunships firing in support of us, and I remember the close air support which we had of our attack aircraft coming down in the valley between the hills, just almost 15 or 20 feet above the ground.

10:28.977 --> 10:31.520
They were so close, dropping napalm to our front.

10:32.401 --> 10:39.310
And we put a good hurting on the enemy, and we got out and regrouped,

10:39.863 --> 10:41.484
came back for another day.

10:43.146 --> 10:47.189
It's one of the only, obviously, close call, I guess you would call.

10:47.249 --> 10:56.798
As a matter of fact, I came up, the magic of the internet tells me about the battle for Hill 400, and it was a narrative written by a Newsweek reporter that was there for that.

10:57.338 --> 10:58.399
Talk a little bit about that.

10:58.459 --> 10:59.861
That was a little dicey.

11:00.982 --> 11:07.868
Hill 400 was, as I recall, was September to October of 1966, about a month after Operation Hastings.

11:08.248 --> 11:08.368
Right.

11:08.686 --> 11:16.437
And we were moving down a ridge line in constant contact with the North Vietnamese.

11:16.457 --> 11:19.221
And our company commander was Captain J.J.

11:19.281 --> 11:21.925
Carroll, the Navy Cross winner.

11:21.945 --> 11:28.093
And we were from in constant combat, as they would say.

11:28.113 --> 11:38.608
And I remembered several times of being in the very prone position, trying to get closer as I could into the ground if there was any way possible.

11:39.331 --> 11:44.558
And having a Marine or two of mine running up the trail, looking down at me and say, sir, where are they at?

11:44.698 --> 11:48.884
And my bravest thing was to lift my arm about four inches above my face and point that way.

11:49.504 --> 11:53.530
And without a question, the Marines would dash forward and go.

11:53.650 --> 12:00.359
And that was inspiration for me to get up and start acting like an aggressive Marine, which they were showing the way.

12:00.379 --> 12:05.305
So it was a tight situation and one I recall vividly.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.557
The reporter who I found this, I'm going to let you pronounce his name.

12:09.638 --> 12:10.819
It's a French name.

12:10.899 --> 12:12.461
He's Arnaud de Borchegrave.

12:12.681 --> 12:14.003
And he worked for Newsweek.

12:14.083 --> 12:14.544
Yes, he did.

12:14.564 --> 12:16.166
You can find this on the internet.

12:16.186 --> 12:20.231
And he reported pretty much a minute by minute from 0930 to 1612.

12:20.311 --> 12:25.517
A couple of his narratives in this.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.920
At 1025, Captain J.J.

12:27.940 --> 12:31.765
Carroll of Miami, commander of Kilo Company, sees me without a helmet.

12:32.015 --> 12:33.477
This is the reporter writing here.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.219
He says, he never wears one.

12:35.259 --> 12:37.461
He unhooked his own from his belt, threw it to me.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.625
I also picked up a flak jacket from a KIA.

12:41.466 --> 12:48.434
At 1043, he writes, first airstrike, two phantoms scream in at treetop level, dropping napalm.

12:48.454 --> 12:51.577
Then on their second pass, 500-pound bombs.

12:51.597 --> 12:54.401
Fragments fly over our holes, thudding into trees.

12:54.421 --> 12:56.303
Two men get hit by shrapnel.

12:56.803 --> 13:00.908
Not close enough, says Captain Carroll to the FAC, the forward air controller.

13:01.327 --> 13:04.230
I feel if it's any closer, we'll all get killed.

13:04.250 --> 13:09.475
But Carroll says the ordinance fell 200 meters away, and he wants it to be 100 meters closer.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.577
Next strike comes in at 75 meters.

13:11.597 --> 13:14.901
This must be what an earthquake feels like.

13:14.921 --> 13:16.502
Pretty good description of what you recall.

13:16.642 --> 13:17.623
I remember it well.

13:17.643 --> 13:18.124
Yes, I do.

13:18.765 --> 13:25.832
Goes on to say at 1130, a grenade rolls down to where Derek Taylor, the correspondent from Britain's Guardian, is crouching.

13:25.872 --> 13:31.097
Taylor, quick as lightning, grabs it, throws it downhill, flips back into his foxhole.

13:31.398 --> 13:36.325
It explodes a second later and doesn't so much as scratch him.

13:37.326 --> 13:41.492
And it goes on and on just to describe this particular action.

13:41.552 --> 13:43.354
But this was your job.

13:43.394 --> 13:44.216
This is what you did.

13:45.017 --> 13:47.180
You probably didn't have time to be scared.

13:47.200 --> 13:47.400
No.

13:48.982 --> 13:50.825
As I said earlier, we were so busy.

13:50.845 --> 13:56.853
But I do remember that our unit, our company, in fact, was on the cover of Life magazine at that time.

13:56.873 --> 13:59.076
It was also on the cover of Newsweek.

13:59.545 --> 14:11.179
And I think that that particular reporter was primarily a political reporter that somebody maybe with a twist of humor sent forward up to our position because he got all that he wanted for sure when he was up there.

14:12.101 --> 14:17.227
You talked about a time, this may have been with the Hastings operation, where you said you went 86 straight days sleeping on the ground.

14:17.327 --> 14:18.729
That was the Hastings operation.

14:18.749 --> 14:22.093
You know, when you're over there, you have to do something, I guess, to...

14:22.411 --> 14:25.755
to put a little humor or try and maybe a little reality into what you're doing.

14:25.775 --> 14:28.298
But I remember going 86 days and sleeping on the ground.

14:28.338 --> 14:38.170
But perhaps even more important, I remember going nine and a half months without seeing a woman with round eyes while we were deployed into Vietnam on that tour.

14:38.430 --> 14:43.596
General Hopgood has supplied us with some photographs, three pictures, and we'd like to go ahead and go to those now.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.141
This is from his Vietnam time and, of course, of his youth.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.904
And there is a young cadet, right?

14:49.924 --> 14:52.367
That's sophomore year at Texas A&M.

14:52.853 --> 14:54.275
I'll set the charge forward.

14:54.295 --> 14:55.556
So you would have been 20, 19?

14:56.057 --> 14:58.119
I would have been probably 18 or 19 at that time.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.361
18 or 19 years old.

14:59.421 --> 15:00.322
I like the hair, by the way.

15:00.462 --> 15:00.883
I do, too.

15:01.303 --> 15:01.684
I do, too.

15:01.704 --> 15:04.407
Squared away cadet right there.

15:04.427 --> 15:04.888
Right there.

15:05.268 --> 15:08.672
Now we obviously fast forward to Vietnam and talk about this picture.

15:08.692 --> 15:09.593
That's you in the background.

15:09.653 --> 15:13.098
That's me in the background trying to oversee what's going on.

15:13.118 --> 15:17.022
And in the foreground with the radio up to his ear is Captain J.J.

15:17.062 --> 15:17.403
Carroll.

15:17.443 --> 15:19.746
And if you look in his left hand, you can see his compass.

15:19.766 --> 15:21.628
So he's coordinating either aircraft

15:22.283 --> 15:28.868
or fire to our front, and the two Marines left to right with them was Daniel Gertzmacher and Perry Francis.

15:29.337 --> 15:44.531
You remember the radio operators because oftentimes the action gets so heavy that you're away from the radio and you'll come back and one of your PFCs or Lance Corporals will be on the radio calling airstrikes or kind of running through things until you get back there.

15:46.132 --> 15:46.472
J.J.

15:46.492 --> 15:54.300
Carroll, as I believe you mentioned, about eight days after this battle for Hill 400, he sadly was killed in action.

15:54.380 --> 15:54.880
Yes, he was.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.163
And the next photograph, I want you to tell us about that.

15:58.615 --> 16:04.023
Well, he was killed in action, and I believe it was late October, early November.

16:04.484 --> 16:10.133
And this is on the birthday of the Marine Corps, 10 November 1966 in Vietnam.

16:10.854 --> 16:14.880
And there was a position about five miles to the south.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.765
It was artillery position, and they named it Camp J.J.

16:17.785 --> 16:19.467
Carroll in his honor.

16:19.487 --> 16:23.453
And this is Marines from Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines.

16:23.513 --> 16:23.914
I'm the

16:24.755 --> 16:33.388
On the right-hand side of the picture, the one kneeling with my arm on my knee and all those other Marines, each has a story in its own right.

16:33.448 --> 16:39.137
And it's wonderful to look at the picture and remember each one for who he was and what he contributed.

16:39.658 --> 16:41.160
Quite a photograph, indeed.

16:41.798 --> 16:43.941
This was just your first tour of Vietnam.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.625
You came home, Marine barracks in D.C., and you married Carolyn.

16:47.845 --> 16:48.767
Yes, I did.

16:48.787 --> 16:52.311
In June of 1967, and you all have been married some 41 years now.

16:52.331 --> 16:53.833
Yes, we have.

16:53.853 --> 16:57.257
A military wife, and we could do another two shows just about her.

16:57.397 --> 16:58.198
I know that we could.

16:58.619 --> 17:03.264
In Washington, just under two years, did security at Camp David.

17:03.284 --> 17:04.185
Talk about that duty.

17:04.266 --> 17:05.187
That is great.

17:05.207 --> 17:08.751
The duty was at that time was the Marine barracks in Washington,

17:08.731 --> 17:15.281
One of our additional duties was to provide security for Camp David, presidential retreat, Thurmont, Maryland.

17:15.301 --> 17:21.711
And the routine was to spend four weeks down at the barracks and then two weeks up on the hill, as we called it.

17:22.572 --> 17:30.684
And to be up there when the president was in residence, at that time it was LBJ, was an experience.

17:31.826 --> 17:33.068
I found it...

17:33.875 --> 17:37.103
enlightening, but I also found it challenging and fun.

17:37.123 --> 17:44.842
One of the things about Camp David is they have an opportunity to shoot all kinds of weapons up there, shotguns, rifles, pistols, etc.

17:44.882 --> 17:50.095
So we had plenty of ammunition courtesy of the Secret Service, so me and my Marines

17:50.463 --> 17:52.088
busted lots of caps up there.

17:52.108 --> 18:06.227
I thought it was interesting that you said that at Quantico, at Basic, you were evaluated for all kinds of duty and one of the things you evidently had graded high on was for this kind of duty because of your experience with the Ross Volunteers at A&M.

18:06.646 --> 18:12.095
The Marine Corps has significant ceremonial responsibilities in the Washington, D.C.

18:12.175 --> 18:12.776
area.

18:12.796 --> 18:17.464
And when I went through the basic school as a second lieutenant, they wrote down ceremonial proficiency.

18:18.426 --> 18:24.756
So when they were looking to make assignments for us lieutenants coming out of Vietnam, somebody noticed that and assigned me back into Washington.

18:25.327 --> 18:31.454
And being able to march and handle a sword proved to be advantageous for getting that assignment.

18:31.474 --> 18:39.923
And I do reflect that the training received as a Ross volunteer at Texas A&M was instrumental in giving me a head start in that area.

18:39.943 --> 18:45.669
After DC, Amphibious Warfare School, August of 1969, back to Vietnam for your second tour.

18:46.089 --> 18:47.951
It was a little bit different than your first tour.

18:48.031 --> 18:49.633
Talk about your second tour.

18:49.793 --> 18:54.118
And then that led to your third tour because you never really did come back home between tours.

18:54.520 --> 18:59.186
Got back to Vietnam in September of 69.

18:59.666 --> 19:13.723
The situation had changed in the fact that the unit I took over, the company, Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, was almost within a click, 1,000 meters of where I'd left the company two years before.

19:13.743 --> 19:19.971
And the situation was more dire or more dangerous, I guess you could say, than when we had left.

19:20.727 --> 19:29.678
And President Nixon had announced the pullout, and the first unit to be pulled out was our, one of the first Marine units was the 3rd Marine Division, which I was in.

19:29.698 --> 19:45.837
So I was a company commander of Charlie-13 for about four or six weeks, right up on the DMZ again, and the situation was as tough and demanding as you could imagine, plus the monsoon season had arrived, so it was constant bad weather and rain coming down.

19:45.857 --> 19:46.498
But when they,

19:47.052 --> 19:51.636
Division went home, I became an aide for the commanding general of the division.

19:51.656 --> 19:52.397
He picked a captain.

19:52.417 --> 20:09.233
In fact, I replaced, I guess I can use the name, he's the current director of the FBI, 1st Lieutenant Muller, who's now the director of the FBI, had been the general's aide, but he wanted a captain to ease the transition, if you will, from the 3rd Division going back to Okinawa.

20:09.253 --> 20:13.617
So we transitioned out of Vietnam back to Okinawa.

20:14.187 --> 20:29.774
and got back there, as I recall, in November of 69, and I was in Okinawa with the 3rd Division and General Jones until April when I extended my tour overseas by two months so I'd be sure to get back to Vietnam for the action.

20:29.794 --> 20:32.719
Of course, there was not joy on the home front when I...

20:32.885 --> 20:53.121
I told Carolyn I was going back for two months, but I did go back to Vietnam and served as a company commander of Echo Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, and this was in the Nang area, somewhat of a static position, but certainly full of challenges as every company command position would be in a combat zone.

20:53.759 --> 20:58.406
The second tour, the first time you're over there, is an aide to General W.K.

20:58.426 --> 20:58.826
Jones.

20:58.846 --> 20:59.367
Is that right?

20:59.387 --> 21:00.048
For six weeks.

21:00.669 --> 21:03.233
And as an aide, there's a lot of flying involved.

21:03.393 --> 21:05.396
And you talked about the marginal weather.

21:06.618 --> 21:09.983
Well, the aide time was, let me correct you, was about six months.

21:10.003 --> 21:13.928
About a month and a half in Vietnam and then three and a half or so back in Okinawa.

21:13.948 --> 21:19.817
But the weather in Vietnam for anybody that's been in that part of the country is...

21:20.135 --> 21:26.783
it can get very bad real in a hurry because not only does it rain, but the ceiling, the cloud level comes way down.

21:26.823 --> 21:33.712
And my wife would tell me that she was so glad when I became an aide because she knew that I was really out of the line of fire.

21:33.732 --> 21:46.969
And then when I got home, I reported some of the very dicey, if you will, helicopter flights of, I remember flying down the coast about 70 miles going south down to Da Nang where the weather was so bad that we just,

21:47.388 --> 21:58.480
hovered along the beach all the way down and one of the passengers on our little Huey helicopter was a Navy chaplain who had his rosary beads out the whole way.

21:59.141 --> 22:02.305
So yeah, there was some interesting moments.

22:02.325 --> 22:07.310
Yeah, when the chaplain gets the beads out.

22:07.631 --> 22:12.496
You had the rifle company around Da Nang and this was your third tour.

22:12.556 --> 22:16.180
Talk just a little bit more about that because I know that you told me that

22:16.700 --> 22:27.120
It was a tough tour because of the morale and keeping the morale up with the people because of the unseen enemy, you said.

22:27.140 --> 22:39.484
Well, what it was is the United States had given every indication that we were coming out of Vietnam, and the units knew, the troops certainly knew that their time in-country

22:40.038 --> 22:42.865
in danger was coming to an end.

22:43.626 --> 22:50.723
And I guess you could say maybe the enemy was emboldened by the fact because they knew what was happening too.

22:51.007 --> 22:56.575
And the Marines, and I guess any troops, don't do well when you have to sit in a static position.

22:57.717 --> 23:01.663
You prefer to be on the attack moving so that you have the initiative, so to speak.

23:01.683 --> 23:11.277
And once we surrendered the offensive initiative, if you will, it became unpleasant, and I think everybody from the

23:11.881 --> 23:22.532
The top on down was ready to get out of Vietnam, and let's say that we answered our nation's call, but it's time to go somewhere else.

23:22.552 --> 23:28.398
This was a time, 1968, 1969, that back home there was a lot of unrest.

23:28.478 --> 23:31.841
It was obviously not a popular war politically.

23:32.322 --> 23:37.787
How did that resonate in Vietnam, not only to the people that you were with, but to you personally?

23:38.408 --> 23:52.963
To me personally, as best I can recall, I felt I was so busy and had such a responsibility for the welfare of my subordinates that I just couldn't put it in to really get to the forefront of my mind.

23:52.983 --> 24:02.914
And I think the troops were so focused on their mission of what they were supposed to be doing that directly it didn't have

24:03.518 --> 24:08.193
that big impact, but indirectly, you never know.

24:08.574 --> 24:15.435
It might be somewhere in the back of your mind, but it's just something you can't afford to think too much about.

24:17.153 --> 24:24.000
But, I mean, it's not like today where, you know, CNN is always there, but you still knew.

24:24.060 --> 24:24.781
You had word.

24:24.801 --> 24:26.623
You knew what was going on back home.

24:26.703 --> 24:26.843
Yes.

24:26.863 --> 24:28.184
Well, we had access.

24:28.265 --> 24:38.735
We had every day you get the Stars and Stripes newspaper, and I think that everybody was interested in what was going back home because that's where everybody wanted to get back to.

24:38.755 --> 24:42.199
So the fact that there was unrest at home was...

24:42.179 --> 24:51.592
Everybody knew that, and it didn't help the situation at all, but we, I'm proud to say, remained focused on what we were supposed to be doing.

24:51.672 --> 24:58.482
When you came back home, were you certain that you were going to stay in the Marines and extend your career, or were there thoughts of getting out and being a civilian?

24:58.622 --> 25:11.781
No, I had made up my mind, I don't know if it was at Texas A&M or when I got commissioned, I just knew that the Marine Corps was going to be my life, was going to be my career.

25:12.098 --> 25:35.507
thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed the the bosses that I had in the Marine Corps the leaders the the troops were just absolutely outstanding and the the lifestyle and the camaraderie was was something that is was just a wonderful to be part of and I felt really honored to to be part of it all and to have a career in the Marine Corps and I felt the

25:35.842 --> 25:42.336
that I had a certain degree of a confidence, then I had the confidence, if you will, to pursue a career in it.

25:42.356 --> 25:46.004
Well, 25 more years you will serve, and we're gonna talk about that next week.

25:46.024 --> 25:46.986
Okay, great, Tom, thank you.

25:47.708 --> 25:55.926
General Ted Hopgood spent another 25 years on active duty after he left Vietnam the last time, a quarter century that took him all over the country and the world.

25:56.294 --> 25:59.162
And that was all before he came back to his alma mater in 1996.

25:59.223 --> 26:03.234
Next week, we will hear more of the career of General Ted Hopgood.

26:03.716 --> 26:04.598
I'm Tom Turberville.

26:04.618 --> 26:06.945
We'll see you next week on Veterans of the Valley.
