Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.577 --> 00:34.678
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:35.283 --> 00:38.188
Bob Gallery was just 17 years old in 1944.

00:38.970 --> 00:46.864
He didn't know that he was about to take the fast track from his home in Saginaw, Michigan, to a foxhole on the front lines of the war in Europe.

00:47.344 --> 00:52.053
But that's pretty much exactly what happened when he was drafted into the Army near War's End.

00:52.594 --> 00:59.586
A 38-year resident of Bryan, Bob Gallery's 99th Infantry, saw conflict eyeball to eyeball, as he puts it.

00:59.802 --> 01:07.167
And he counts himself fortunate to have come home uninjured, indeed to have come home at all, as so many who served did not.

01:07.188 --> 01:11.382
Please welcome Silver Star medal winner Bob Gallery to Veterans of the Valley.

01:12.020 --> 01:16.225
Bob, you and I have known each other for a long time from our days of playing golf over at Briarcrest.

01:16.245 --> 01:21.291
And finally, I get to have you on this show that means so much to me to talk about your service in World War II.

01:21.371 --> 01:23.053
Thank you for being here and thank you for your service.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.214
Well, thank you very much.

01:24.455 --> 01:26.257
And I hope I do all right with you.

01:26.277 --> 01:27.619
You're going to do great.

01:28.199 --> 01:30.402
Because it's a fascinating story, it really is.

01:31.023 --> 01:32.825
Like we said, grew up in Saginaw, Michigan.

01:32.865 --> 01:35.908
And talk about your desire to get into the service.

01:35.948 --> 01:39.032
You wanted to go into the Navy, but you had a little bit of a weight problem.

01:39.092 --> 01:39.833
Talk about that.

01:39.813 --> 01:45.558
I wanted to go in the Navy and had to weigh 120 pounds, and I weighed 119 a little over.

01:46.599 --> 01:52.985
And three times was out, and I couldn't get to the weight of 120 pounds.

01:55.267 --> 02:05.377
So the recruiting officer said, you know, he said, when you leave here, go up around this corner on the post office center, and there's a sign there that says draft board.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.879
So I walked in.

02:08.551 --> 02:15.398
told a young lady I was 18 today, and she signed me up, and that was it.

02:15.418 --> 02:27.090
And about two weeks later, I go back to the draft board in Detroit, Michigan, and I passed everything, and the fellow asked me what branch I wanted, and I said Navy.

02:27.110 --> 02:31.555
So he stamped Navy on there and sent me home until they called.

02:31.575 --> 02:36.820
When they called us back, there was army out over top of

02:37.036 --> 02:40.462
the word Navy, and so that's how I ended up in the Army.

02:41.143 --> 02:47.134
Well, and you said that probably the reason for that was because that was the time that they were planning the final push.

02:47.194 --> 02:53.345
D-Day was occurring, and they were planning the final push through Europe, so they needed infantry guys on the ground in Europe.

02:53.486 --> 02:56.892
Yes, they needed bodies, so it didn't matter what I weighed.

02:57.312 --> 02:58.234
Right, right.

02:58.855 --> 03:02.939
Well, I was going to mention, I don't understand because I can eat one candy bar and gain a half a pound.

03:02.959 --> 03:05.481
I don't understand why you had trouble gaining a half a pound.

03:05.501 --> 03:08.284
It's never a problem for me to do that.

03:08.304 --> 03:11.827
So you bussed to Detroit for your physical and you passed everything, like you said.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.710
You went to basic at Camp Robinson in Little Rock, Arkansas.

03:14.730 --> 03:16.311
Little Rock, Arkansas.

03:16.331 --> 03:16.431
Yeah.

03:16.451 --> 03:17.352
What was basic like?

03:17.412 --> 03:18.233
What did you learn?

03:18.313 --> 03:23.277
Obviously, not what you needed to prepare you for where you were about to go.

03:23.297 --> 03:27.501
Well, mainly defense, you know, protect yourself and your buddies.

03:28.182 --> 03:28.322
Mm-hmm.

03:28.825 --> 03:34.033
Tried to teach us how to dig a hole, but in Arkansas, it was like this tabletop.

03:34.053 --> 03:38.921
And you dig, you knock the dust off, and that was about the end of our voxel.

03:39.242 --> 03:39.522
Right.

03:40.304 --> 03:43.949
But anyway, we joked about that over the years.

03:43.969 --> 03:46.574
And it was quite an experience.

03:46.594 --> 03:51.762
And when we finished our basic, which they put us through quite a drill for...

03:53.311 --> 04:08.417
I can't remember how long it was it was like I'm gonna say six weeks or something like it was a very fast program and fortunately I made it through being my low weight why sometimes they had us

04:09.038 --> 04:12.502
pitching big logs back and forth to each other in training.

04:12.542 --> 04:16.127
And when you're on the tail end of it, it was kind of tough at times.

04:16.147 --> 04:16.588
Exactly.

04:16.968 --> 04:24.358
But anyway, I made it through the training and survived, which was the main part.

04:24.578 --> 04:29.704
And my determination is wanting to be in the service, so I worked hard at it.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.547
And you were there.

04:31.647 --> 04:36.413
But again, like we talked about, the fast track, you were on a train to New Jersey to get your...

04:36.916 --> 04:42.343
your uniforms, and before you knew it, you were on the Queen Elizabeth and headed to the war in Europe.

04:42.484 --> 04:43.044
That's right.

04:43.365 --> 04:53.158
We left Arkansas on the troop train and went into New Jersey and Camp Kilmer, I believe was the name of it.

04:53.178 --> 05:01.930
But anyway, we were equipped with everything we had to have to take care of the weather that they had over there.

05:01.950 --> 05:05.775
There was two, three foot of snow on the level and so on and so forth, very cold.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.719
kind of like our north part of the country here in our United States.

05:10.739 --> 05:35.425
But we were used to everything and then when we got to England, we were on a troop train again and crossed the country and then loaded on a boat, crossed the English Channel and then from there we got onto a troop train and then ended up in Belgium

05:37.126 --> 05:41.832
And then in trucks and hauled us up to the front line directly into foxholes.

05:42.473 --> 05:43.795
And that was it.

05:43.815 --> 05:47.760
When did, when were you assigned to the 99th?

05:47.820 --> 05:50.483
When did you know that that, was that during basic or when you got to?

05:50.904 --> 05:53.988
That's when we, when we arrived there at the front line.

05:54.028 --> 05:56.651
When you arrived at the front line, that's when you were assigned to the 99th.

05:57.332 --> 06:05.142
So when you were going across, you didn't know exactly what your, your mission was going to be, what your, what your tour was going to be, that you were going to,

06:05.560 --> 06:07.742
that you were going to be a ground soldier in foxholes.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.504
Yeah, I had no idea at the time.

06:09.564 --> 06:16.891
We were put right up in the front line and we couldn't come out of the foxhole at night.

06:18.093 --> 06:20.535
We came out at night, we couldn't go out in the daytime.

06:20.555 --> 06:20.815
Right.

06:21.596 --> 06:26.741
Because they had snipers all over and then they liked to aim at that steel helmet.

06:27.022 --> 06:27.282
Right.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.806
So were you pretty quickly into this routine?

06:30.826 --> 06:33.188
Were you involved in conflict?

06:33.708 --> 06:39.277
pretty early on as far as being shot at and it was the real deal?

06:39.457 --> 06:51.075
Probably within, that's so long now I can't remember, within 24 hours we were already going on patrols and going right into the middle of, through the German

06:52.642 --> 06:59.813
And this foxhole was the first foxhole you dug is one you had to dig because... Well, this one was already dug.

06:59.833 --> 07:00.934
We didn't have to dig this one.

07:01.155 --> 07:01.475
I see.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.897
We just crawled in this one.

07:02.917 --> 07:03.338
Right.

07:03.358 --> 07:14.034
But if you can imagine the size of this table right here, this was about the width of a foxhole.

07:14.355 --> 07:14.615
Right.

07:15.957 --> 07:16.818
We could stretch out.

07:17.519 --> 07:19.502
Matter of fact, my buddy was about your size, Tom.

07:19.823 --> 07:20.003
Uh-huh.

07:20.784 --> 07:21.265
And...

07:21.515 --> 07:45.430
so there wasn't much room for you. There wasn't much room we we we our sleeping bags were here and we had a step here and then up and we were we would change shifts every two hours because of the cold weather. Right. And uh so we were up here where we could we could see we had a spot here where we could look out and look out toward the

07:45.798 --> 07:49.482
the front line of where they might come at us.

07:50.443 --> 08:04.239
And so in two hours, every two hours we'd swap and we'd rub each other's feet and then we'd crawl in the sleeping bag and sleep for maybe two hours and then we'd change again.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.501
And that's what took place during the night.

08:07.502 --> 08:08.744
This was the winter of 1944.

08:08.804 --> 08:11.447
That was in 1944.

08:11.467 --> 08:14.370
So this was during the time of the Battle of the Bulge and we've all

08:14.654 --> 08:25.304
heard about the bulge and the weather and the snow and so you were talking about you had to rub each other's feet just to keep the circulation and those who didn't, many of them lost their feet to frostbite.

08:25.324 --> 08:26.605
Very true, very true.

08:28.186 --> 08:37.815
And it was a sad thing when you saw a young man or a person when his feet were frozen and they started to rot.

08:38.155 --> 08:39.556
Right, right.

08:39.576 --> 08:43.480
And then they were shipped off to the medics and we never saw them again.

08:44.000 --> 08:58.582
Were you aware of what your unit was trying to accomplish, that this was the final push, that this was the final push to try to get Germany to surrender, to stop the war in Europe?

08:59.604 --> 09:01.286
Not right away we weren't.

09:02.388 --> 09:11.442
We were defending them coming into Belgium, but that was sort of the

09:12.991 --> 09:19.259
the end of the push of the Germans as far as they were able to get them from there and then we were pushing them back.

09:19.699 --> 09:20.600
Right.

09:20.620 --> 09:26.207
And how much territory we covered, I don't have any idea.

09:26.227 --> 09:30.412
It could have been 10 miles, it could have been a thousand miles, but we kept on the move.

09:31.834 --> 09:40.905
Most of the veterans that I've talked to that served in Europe, when they talk about the Germans, they talk about them in terms of that these were young kids too that didn't,

09:41.476 --> 09:44.899
any more want to be involved in war than the Americans did.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.240
Is that how you found them?

09:46.320 --> 09:56.309
A lot of them were at the time where we were in this particular area when we started out, we had pretty much professional soldiers that we were dealing with at that time.

09:56.689 --> 09:56.949
Right.

09:56.969 --> 10:06.357
But as the time went on and we kept moving and moving and coming into different communities, they were replacing personnel with whoever they could get.

10:06.598 --> 10:06.838
Right.

10:06.858 --> 10:08.699
Whoever was warm.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.521
And they would get younger.

10:10.687 --> 10:21.042
Yeah, they would get younger and more afraid and sort of with the same mentality that you had, you know, what am I doing here and let's get this thing over with.

10:21.342 --> 10:25.448
You talked about the patrols and how you'd go out and patrol about once a week.

10:26.310 --> 10:36.044
And you talked about one particular patrol where you just passed within feet of a tent that was full of Germans and they never suspected or heard you.

10:36.244 --> 10:40.390
They were talking and telling stories, I guess, and they didn't hear us go by them.

10:40.741 --> 11:06.293
and we walked right real close within two three feet of their tent and fortunately we we got by and we came back after we went to the area that we were assigned to go to to inspect why then we turn around come right back by him again then came back to our original foxhole there'd be about 20 of you right it's about yeah there's 15 or 20 of us right

11:06.863 --> 11:18.081
I don't know why we had that size of a unit, but usually they would come in and take a squad out of your platoon.

11:18.542 --> 11:27.056
And so we all went, and if we got into an encounter, I guess we had enough of us there, hopefully we could take care of ourselves.

11:27.377 --> 11:28.038
Right, right.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.460
That was pretty much the theory.

11:31.043 --> 11:33.647
But we went on these patrols right away, and it was just,

11:35.905 --> 11:41.933
At first we didn't even have any idea what we were going to do or where we were going.

11:41.954 --> 11:47.621
And it was quite, it didn't have time to get scared.

11:49.544 --> 11:54.351
I guess maybe if I was older and had a family back here with children and so on and so forth, then that would be different.

11:54.391 --> 11:57.255
But my responsibilities when I left

11:57.573 --> 12:00.877
the United States, and I was still, you know, just me.

12:01.218 --> 12:02.339
Right, right.

12:02.359 --> 12:07.646
Well, like 17 and 18-year-olds, they think they're bulletproof, and you thought the same thing.

12:07.866 --> 12:15.175
But still, you know, I'm thinking, you know, here you are, 17, 18 years old, and you're a long way from Saginaw, Michigan, aren't you?

12:15.195 --> 12:16.637
A long ways.

12:16.657 --> 12:17.638
Yes, very true.

12:19.180 --> 12:27.090
Talk about, you said that there were conflicts, there were resistance that you ran into

12:27.779 --> 12:28.760
from time to time.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.624
You described it as sometimes eyeball to eyeball.

12:31.644 --> 12:32.886
Yeah, oh yeah, that's true.

12:33.767 --> 12:52.133
When we were going through the forest, after we went on the move, we didn't go back to our original overnight foxhole, but when we got moving, we'd run into situations where it could be a

12:54.239 --> 12:56.422
Right where that young lady's standing.

12:57.264 --> 13:04.335
It could be a place where they bed down and all of a sudden one of them would pop out and point a rifle at you.

13:06.058 --> 13:11.767
Or he would say, well, you know, he didn't act like he wanted to kill us.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.134
And it was just different things like that would happen.

13:16.234 --> 13:21.462
And then we would, young kids, snipers would shoot at us.

13:22.589 --> 13:24.792
when we kind of got out in the open a little bit.

13:25.053 --> 13:35.028
We were going through the forest that was like, for instance, all of this mechanic stuff here, you'd have to crawl over it and so on and so forth.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.252
Then you're in two, three foot of snow.

13:37.272 --> 13:37.532
Right.

13:38.073 --> 13:41.598
And then your buddy gets shot, which mine did.

13:41.618 --> 13:42.400
Yeah, talk about that.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.484
He was your friend that was hauling your ammo, right?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.349
You were carrying a... I was carrying a VAR.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.112
He was carrying the ammunition.

13:50.612 --> 13:50.993
Right.

13:51.327 --> 13:54.430
He got shot and took his shoulder practically off.

13:54.510 --> 13:57.774
His arm was just hanging, but then I had to go on without him.

13:57.794 --> 14:01.758
I didn't have any help after that for a while anyway.

14:02.418 --> 14:10.086
But encounters like that, then you start to think, well, what am I into here?

14:11.588 --> 14:18.415
But we had to defend each other was the whole theory when we encountered something like that.

14:19.103 --> 14:28.357
Now, there were patrols, which you said you went out, and I guess the purpose of those was to go out and find the enemy and to come back and sort of report where they were.

14:29.499 --> 14:38.853
But then there was the push, and you talk a lot about that, especially when you joined up with General Patton, who was on your left flank, and he was pretty much directing the push.

14:38.873 --> 14:42.258
And when we say push, we really mean push.

14:42.278 --> 14:48.047
You all moved a long way in a little amount of time and in bad weather also.

14:48.770 --> 14:49.673
Rain or shine.

14:50.195 --> 14:50.797
Rain or shine.

14:52.743 --> 14:55.331
And we would move.

14:55.652 --> 15:02.053
We were scheduled to go like, say, five miles.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.392
30 miles, it didn't matter what it was.

15:04.673 --> 15:05.974
Everything kept going.

15:06.455 --> 15:11.602
We had our tanks and our equipment with us, and we had to just keep moving.

15:11.642 --> 15:14.025
If it didn't, you might get ran over by a tank.

15:14.385 --> 15:16.087
But then we'd jump up on top sometimes.

15:16.107 --> 15:20.874
If they went too fast, we'd jump up on the tank and get a free ride and get a little rest.

15:21.354 --> 15:29.745
At that time, when we got out of the forest, we kept on the move real fast.

15:30.468 --> 15:37.398
And when we got to the Rhine River, we slowed down somewhat there.

15:37.438 --> 15:42.025
I think we had about a half a day rest because we had to get everything prepared up front.

15:42.526 --> 15:48.134
The engineers got in there and put pontoon bridges across the river and stuff like that.

15:48.875 --> 15:58.129
And then when they got pretty much things were secured, then we started walking across the bridge, the railroad bridge.

16:00.050 --> 16:17.275
That was an experience because they were all through the hillside, and the backside was just a big hill, and we were going into a dark tunnel, which we didn't enter the tunnel, but we had to cross the bridge to get the land and then go off to the front.

16:17.695 --> 16:19.197
We had a two-mile front the first night.

16:20.860 --> 16:27.289
And we were shot at, but fortunately we had a few boys hit, but I was lucky.

16:28.703 --> 16:30.245
I was lucky through the whole war.

16:30.345 --> 16:40.560
I just didn't get... You really got nothing more than just a little bit of shrapnel on your cheek that drew a little bit of blood, but other than that... Yeah, we had that.

16:40.580 --> 16:47.129
And then one time we had taken this... We were... We had not taken the village.

16:47.289 --> 16:53.899
We were outside of it, and we bed down in a tree area, and they were throwing mortars at us.

16:53.919 --> 16:56.162
And one led over here about...

16:56.480 --> 16:59.783
maybe as far as that stands, and fortunately it was a dud.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.586
And we could hear them coming down.

17:08.252 --> 17:11.675
But it was a dud, and we lived through that one, I'll tell you.

17:11.995 --> 17:14.958
If that would have went off, I wouldn't be here today talking to you.

17:14.978 --> 17:16.440
Absolutely.

17:17.441 --> 17:24.968
You talked about seeing the line of foxholes and the strapping by

17:25.437 --> 17:28.480
Bed Check Charlie and jumping into the foxholes full of water.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.181
Talk about that.

17:29.662 --> 17:32.925
Yeah, that's after we went back, after we were relieved.

17:32.965 --> 17:33.806
By the 69th.

17:34.127 --> 17:35.989
But we called him Bed Check Charlie.

17:36.309 --> 17:45.379
Every midnight, he would come through and he would strafe, strafe, he'd shoot ammo from the plane.

17:45.579 --> 17:48.643
Yeah, just come like what, like 50 feet above your head, right?

17:48.663 --> 17:50.445
He'd just come in and strafe right on through.

17:50.485 --> 17:55.410
And of course, when he was going over, we didn't stick our head out of the

17:55.711 --> 17:55.991
No.

17:56.252 --> 17:59.755
Out of the box of it all.

18:00.476 --> 18:06.383
But that was a warning that we knew was going to happen every night.

18:07.764 --> 18:10.187
So we just respected him.

18:12.910 --> 18:19.698
Talk about, as I mentioned in the introduction, you were awarded the Silver Star Medal.

18:19.898 --> 18:23.642
It's a fascinating story concerning a city that

18:23.960 --> 18:27.625
You all thought that you had pretty much cleaned out, but it turned out that you hadn't.

18:27.785 --> 18:34.494
Take us from why you had gone out on your own patrol by yourself and what you found.

18:35.215 --> 18:44.668
Well, we had taken the city, and we had all the boys up front, and we pretty much secured the area.

18:46.690 --> 18:51.878
So Lieutenant Brown asked me to go back to the rear echelon and let them know we had the city secured.

18:52.739 --> 19:03.436
So I'm on my way back, and this lady came out of this building and told me that there were German soldiers in the cellar.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.302
And I said, no, we've cleaned the city out.

19:07.342 --> 19:08.864
There's nothing here.

19:09.245 --> 19:12.750
So she grabbed me by the arm and she pulled me, asked me to go in.

19:12.770 --> 19:13.812
So I felt it was all right.

19:15.057 --> 19:18.801
And I'm all by myself and not thinking, you know, what's going on?

19:18.821 --> 19:25.309
But anyway, we walk into this big building here like you had a hallway going all the way down to that back wall.

19:26.470 --> 19:29.894
She takes me into there, and she's got a hold of me all the time.

19:30.174 --> 19:32.216
She said, Germans are in it.

19:32.236 --> 19:37.762
So we get in this room, and she said, they're down there.

19:38.563 --> 19:42.187
And I'm looking through just a dark hole.

19:42.207 --> 19:44.490
So I hollered in German for them to come out.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.900
And there wasn't a sound, absolutely dead silent.

19:50.724 --> 19:58.381
So I let a round off of my rifle down in there, and it sounded like a big old cannon in that building.

19:58.461 --> 20:03.111
But anyway, they started coming out.

20:03.131 --> 20:05.095
And as they did, then I'm backing out.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.478
And they kept coming, kept coming, kept coming.

20:09.558 --> 20:11.381
I go, where in the world?

20:12.122 --> 20:18.712
Anyway, when I got them up to this room, then there was a small hallway.

20:18.732 --> 20:20.855
We had the entrance to get into that.

20:20.875 --> 20:23.740
We had to get out that to get to the street.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.205
And they got right up to the edge of that door.

20:27.225 --> 20:35.217
And they had captured a French soldier.

20:35.551 --> 20:40.538
And he was in front of them, and I couldn't tell, and they stopped.

20:40.558 --> 20:43.102
And I asked them to keep coming, and they wouldn't.

20:43.182 --> 20:46.887
So I shot into the wall, and I caught this fellow in the leg.

20:47.809 --> 20:53.637
And he went down like the building fell on him, a scream, a bloody murder.

20:53.657 --> 20:58.564
And anyway, from that, then they came out.

20:58.585 --> 21:03.752
So I backed out, and I got them in the street, and they kept coming.

21:05.285 --> 21:09.910
After we got them all out there, we had 38 soldiers.

21:11.051 --> 21:13.594
And everybody said, well, how did we miss them?

21:14.555 --> 21:20.221
But anyway, they were hiding down there in that cellar and we got them out.

21:20.261 --> 21:22.243
And then I got some help after that.

21:22.683 --> 21:28.009
Fortunately, I didn't have any real problem with them trying to shoot me or anything like that.

21:30.011 --> 21:31.512
I never went back into the cellar.

21:31.573 --> 21:33.975
Someone else did.

21:34.090 --> 21:37.994
What we found, to this day, I don't have any idea what was in there.

21:38.334 --> 21:40.256
Ammo, guns, or what.

21:40.276 --> 21:41.418
Exactly.

21:41.438 --> 21:43.600
But I was lucky.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.281
I could have been.

21:44.321 --> 21:50.927
They could have shot me just like we're right here now, just walking the trigger, and I wouldn't be here.

21:50.947 --> 21:52.649
Because there was nobody around until.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.912
Because I had three shots that I had fired.

21:56.733 --> 22:03.220
And then pretty soon Lieutenant Brown, well, he came himself too, but some other people came and helped

22:03.571 --> 22:05.194
Right.

22:05.214 --> 22:09.461
And for that, you received the Silver Star for that action.

22:09.481 --> 22:18.096
And talk about, you said one time moving with Patton, you marched 37 miles in one day.

22:18.778 --> 22:24.528
37 miles after we crossed the Vermaugen River, Vermaugen Bridge.

22:24.548 --> 22:25.590
Right.

22:26.371 --> 22:28.735
We had a two-mile front the first night.

22:29.677 --> 22:34.262
The next morning, we were ordered to get going.

22:34.282 --> 22:39.548
And of course, our head commander up there, he knew where we were going, so and so forth.

22:40.709 --> 22:45.174
And we went 37 miles on one box of K-rushings.

22:47.317 --> 22:53.143
And our kitchen was with us all the time.

22:53.203 --> 22:57.608
They couldn't keep up with us and didn't have time to cook a hot meal for us.

22:57.959 --> 23:01.945
They tried to give us a hot meal every day if it's possible.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.447
Right, right.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.692
Eventually you moved into Czechoslovakia.

23:07.253 --> 23:13.562
We're getting down near to the end, and the war ended in Europe.

23:13.582 --> 23:17.888
And those that had been there less than a year were assigned to come back to the States.

23:17.908 --> 23:20.933
You joined the 2nd Infantry Division at this time.

23:20.953 --> 23:23.196
Yeah, we were reassigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.

23:23.497 --> 23:23.737
Right.

23:24.338 --> 23:27.763
And we waited, I think it was about 30 days,

23:28.537 --> 23:31.420
And then we were sent back to the United States.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.061
Right.

23:32.081 --> 23:33.763
You said to Bastrop, to Camp Swift.

23:33.783 --> 23:35.424
That's where the staging area was.

23:35.444 --> 23:46.816
Like so many soldiers who came from Europe, you were being prepared and being staged to move on to Japan for what people assumed would be a ground war in Japan.

23:47.057 --> 23:48.458
Right.

23:48.478 --> 23:50.280
And that's where it took place.

23:50.440 --> 23:56.907
And while we were at...

23:58.338 --> 24:06.917
that location why three, four of us, no, about six of us got together and we were all about the same age and we decided we'd stay in the service.

24:07.979 --> 24:13.070
But that was after we found out the war was over.

24:14.934 --> 24:17.680
And so we all shipped over for three years.

24:18.453 --> 24:22.940
I stayed in and then from there we went to Washington State Camp Fort Lewis.

24:23.281 --> 24:23.882
Right.

24:23.902 --> 24:34.039
And stayed up there until come time for me to get discharged out of the service in 49, 51 I think is when I was legally discharged.

24:34.059 --> 24:34.720
Right, right.

24:34.740 --> 24:41.130
So about a six-year hitch in the Army which included the better part of a year in Europe.

24:41.331 --> 24:42.392
In Europe, yeah.

24:42.412 --> 24:42.813
In Europe.

24:43.434 --> 24:45.237
Of course, after you...

24:45.419 --> 24:48.803
You got out, you say you went to San Diego?

24:49.263 --> 24:50.064
Moved to San Diego.

24:50.104 --> 24:52.187
Moved to San Diego and you started selling cars there.

24:52.207 --> 24:54.930
Started selling cars.

24:54.950 --> 25:01.377
And then a good friend of ours is, the Datsun automobile became available in the United States.

25:01.637 --> 25:02.518
Right.

25:02.538 --> 25:14.331
And he was one of the representatives signing up dealers and a friend of mine that is deceased now but had a dealership in Houston and I ended up up here.

25:14.672 --> 25:15.072
Right.

25:15.659 --> 25:18.021
And it was up here for about almost 18 years.

25:19.042 --> 25:19.222
Right.

25:19.242 --> 25:25.127
1972, you opened your dealership here in Bryan College Station.

25:25.147 --> 25:25.268
Right.

25:25.388 --> 25:28.130
People remember Gallery Nissan.

25:28.410 --> 25:32.134
And so in 72, you opened it.

25:32.234 --> 25:35.577
And you've been retired for about how long now?

25:35.597 --> 25:36.137
Since 89.

25:36.658 --> 25:37.198
Since 1989.

25:37.218 --> 25:41.722
Well, actually, about 91, somewhere in there.

25:41.742 --> 25:42.023
Right.

25:42.183 --> 25:43.624
Time we closed everything out.

25:43.807 --> 25:47.751
Your family, you have a daughter who lives in Rhode Island, and you say she's very happy there.

25:47.771 --> 25:49.532
She doesn't want to come to Texas, right?

25:49.552 --> 25:51.374
She says, this is paradise.

25:53.216 --> 25:56.318
I remember the heat in Texas, and I don't want to come back.

25:59.962 --> 26:11.232
Bob was one of the hundred or so veterans who recently went to Washington with us for the Lone Star Honor Flight, and I know that was a great experience that

26:11.431 --> 26:13.333
I got to share with the veterans.

26:13.373 --> 26:16.517
And as a veteran yourself, I know you had a great time that day.

26:16.557 --> 26:18.379
That was a great, great experience.

26:18.459 --> 26:28.010
And I'd been back to D Street a couple of times, but I didn't get to see the territory that we did when we went through everything there that day.

26:28.271 --> 26:28.851
Right.

26:30.073 --> 26:31.795
That memorial is something else.

26:33.076 --> 26:35.900
And everything else, all the different places we got to see.

26:35.940 --> 26:36.621
Right.

26:37.261 --> 26:40.425
And I might take my wife back someday and show her them.

26:41.418 --> 26:44.383
It would be a great thing to do.

26:44.443 --> 26:45.184
It was a great thing.

26:45.565 --> 26:47.888
I met a couple of fellows that live right here in the area.

26:48.429 --> 26:48.990
Right.

26:49.010 --> 26:51.694
That was in the same outfit that I was in the 99th.

26:52.936 --> 26:54.559
Exactly.

26:54.579 --> 27:07.419
So when you look back on your service, it wasn't a long service by a lot of standards, but again, you do count yourself very fortunate to have come home when, like we said, so many did not come home.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.180
That's right.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.282
They're just...

27:10.527 --> 27:19.217
It's just an experience that I wouldn't care to go through again, but I wouldn't take anything for it.

27:19.778 --> 27:20.939
Well, we thank you for your service.

27:21.000 --> 27:21.680
We appreciate it.

27:21.700 --> 27:22.521
We're out of time.

27:22.541 --> 27:22.922
Thank you.

27:23.002 --> 27:25.024
And thank you, Bob, for being here and telling your story.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.186
Thank you.

27:26.206 --> 27:31.873
Some 66 years later, Bob Gallery recounts his six-year hitch in the Army with amazing clarity.

27:31.933 --> 27:38.741
But that first year, a teenager following General Patton in the final push through Germany could never easily be forgotten.

27:38.801 --> 27:39.842
Bob has one daughter.

27:40.193 --> 27:45.684
And he and Lois have been married for 37 years as they enjoy their much-deserved retirement in Bryan.

27:45.704 --> 27:48.791
We salute Bob Gallery for his service as we do all veterans.

27:49.192 --> 27:50.113
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:50.154 --> 27:52.819
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:52.819 --> 28:05.819
