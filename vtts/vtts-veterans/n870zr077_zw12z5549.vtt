00:28.578 --> 00:30.325
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.345 --> 00:31.506
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.380 --> 00:39.049
It certainly was not just the officers or the platoon leaders or even the squad leaders who fought for our freedoms in World War II.

00:39.589 --> 00:45.016
Private First Class Dick Davison of Bryan was a pure soldier in Europe, a rifle fighter on the ground.

00:45.557 --> 00:53.848
He continues his story of proud service today and will tell you also a sobering account of the atrocity known as Operation Keelhaul.

00:54.453 --> 00:56.837
Dick Davison, a pleasure to have you back for a second week.

00:56.897 --> 00:59.140
You have a story that could not be told in 30 minutes.

00:59.701 --> 01:03.006
So we're going to go with more.

01:03.026 --> 01:05.530
We're going to talk about Operation Keelhaul towards the end of the show.

01:05.830 --> 01:08.995
But I want to sort of continue where we left off last week.

01:09.035 --> 01:18.570
But for those who want to be introduced to you, you were a young man, went to VMI, 18 years old and retired.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.397
A little while later, you went on overseas.

01:21.959 --> 01:26.891
Sort of talk about, take us from there to sort of where we left off last week.

01:26.951 --> 01:30.079
You were a man that was in an awful lot of battles and we're very fortunate.

01:30.785 --> 01:40.578
Yeah, I told last time about how I went overseas with the 70th Division, but because of a little confrontation I had with the sergeant, I wound up in the 80th Division, which is where I actually fought.

01:40.598 --> 01:47.146
And when we stopped last time, we were in the middle of a hard fight for the little town of Borscheid in Luxembourg.

01:47.807 --> 01:51.752
Turns out that before that we took that town, we'd lost about 20 men out of the company.

01:52.533 --> 01:56.538
I described earlier how my platoon had nearly been wiped out in this minefield.

01:56.558 --> 01:59.722
We had two more killed taking Borscheid.

01:59.762 --> 02:00.403
So we were down...

02:01.042 --> 02:02.785
Probably it's no more than 10 men.

02:03.185 --> 02:03.305
Right.

02:03.325 --> 02:10.756
To give you an idea, you know, I called my account, not band of brothers, but band of strangers, because in December, when I joined them, there were only five men.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.680
Now we're down to about 10 men.

02:14.241 --> 02:15.183
Full strength is 40.

02:15.323 --> 02:21.071
And it was very difficult to get close to these people, not because you didn't want to, but because the next day they might be gone.

02:21.131 --> 02:21.612
And they were.

02:21.752 --> 02:22.653
They were, exactly.

02:22.673 --> 02:24.196
I'd already lost one foxhole buddy.

02:24.596 --> 02:28.662
Well, after a little bit more time, we wound up on the banks of the Sour River.

02:29.103 --> 02:29.243
Mm-hmm.

02:29.223 --> 02:32.706
And I had some stories there, but I don't have time to tell all of them.

02:32.726 --> 02:36.229
I want to get to the main one, which is the crossing of the river.

02:36.950 --> 02:45.237
But it turns out there that this is the boundary between Germany and Luxembourg.

02:45.658 --> 02:50.142
And on the other side of the river is the infamous Siegfried Line.

02:50.162 --> 02:55.606
Now, since we'd lost so many men, we were filled up again with replacements.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.508
Built rock back up to full strength.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.265
We got a brand new second lieutenant because our second lieutenant had been killed.

03:01.886 --> 03:02.007
Right.

03:02.027 --> 03:05.893
And we got, I think, no, I still had my squad leader.

03:06.274 --> 03:06.394
Right.

03:06.414 --> 03:07.876
He'd become a platoon sergeant.

03:07.916 --> 03:08.898
No, that was later.

03:09.278 --> 03:09.399
Right.

03:09.419 --> 03:13.605
Anyway, we were built up to full strength for the crossing of the river.

03:13.625 --> 03:17.151
Now, the interesting thing was the plan to cross the river.

03:17.131 --> 03:26.967
The river had a rather steep bank and it was rather swift, but there was a little road that ran alongside the river about a hundred feet from the river.

03:26.987 --> 03:30.694
And there was some woods between the river and the road.

03:31.034 --> 03:38.667
So the idea was at night we carried boats down and put them on that road until we have enough boats to get everybody in the company across.

03:39.355 --> 03:43.564
Then under the cover of a heavy artillery bombardment, we run down, we grab our boats.

03:43.664 --> 03:46.910
The Germans, of course, can't hear us or see us either one because it's night.

03:47.191 --> 03:53.584
We grab our boats, we run down to the river, we rear across, and when we have enough men across, we storm the hill and take it.

03:54.256 --> 03:54.997
This is the plan.

03:56.279 --> 04:03.912
Well, on the night of, actually the early morning of February the 7th, 1945, we started this operation.

04:04.152 --> 04:07.097
It was a black, black night.

04:07.117 --> 04:13.147
And you heard curses as men fell down precipices and stumbled and got muddy all the way down.

04:13.167 --> 04:19.858
Before we actually got down there, it turns out that it was at 2 o'clock in the morning, the artillery opened up.

04:20.210 --> 04:24.801
And I want to mention that because I've never seen anything like it.

04:24.961 --> 04:28.790
This was a major offense and we were attacking a difficult position.

04:28.810 --> 04:33.561
So they had lined up 12 battalions of artillery behind, I believe, two battalions of infantry.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.654
And when they opened up, it was what they used to call drum fire.

04:37.674 --> 04:40.339
I mean, it was just never stopping.

04:40.359 --> 04:42.684
And the ground heaved and the lights flashed.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.006
And this went on and on and on.

04:44.026 --> 04:46.711
But we worked our way down to the river as we were supposed to.

04:47.092 --> 04:49.496
And after about 30 minutes, the fire slowed down some.

04:49.857 --> 04:53.263
After all, we were supposed to be across not long after this.

04:53.283 --> 04:55.086
So we grabbed the boats just like we were supposed to.

04:55.527 --> 04:56.409
We start to the river.

04:57.370 --> 04:58.232
And guess what?

04:58.634 --> 05:01.900
Those little trees, they're only about this big, but too big to break.

05:02.461 --> 05:06.408
We're so close together, we couldn't get our boats to the river.

05:06.428 --> 05:10.234
And it turns out that E Company that was crossing alongside of us had an equal problem.

05:10.515 --> 05:13.861
They had an embankment so high that they couldn't get their boats to the river.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.727
Poor old F Company got across all by themselves and promptly got pinned down.

05:17.747 --> 05:20.372
They got all the German fire and they went nowhere.

05:21.179 --> 05:24.968
Well, we tried to get our boats to the river until daylight came.

05:24.988 --> 05:27.495
And as soon as daylight came, boy, the Germans opened up on us.

05:27.515 --> 05:28.697
Shells came screaming in.

05:28.938 --> 05:29.900
There was nothing to do but run.

05:29.941 --> 05:32.687
We were going to be wiped out otherwise because we couldn't get to them.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.895
But they could darn sure shell us because they were on the hill and they could see us.

05:35.935 --> 05:36.657
We were close.

05:37.328 --> 05:39.891
So I ran up the hill until I found a place to hide.

05:39.931 --> 05:41.654
It was a bunch of rocks that I hid in.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.738
Some of the guys kept running, and we didn't see for another day or two.

05:44.758 --> 05:48.022
But I hid among those rocks along with four or five other guys, and I just sat there.

05:48.603 --> 05:49.985
Probably ate my lunch while I was there.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.588
Didn't have anything else to do.

05:52.608 --> 05:58.136
Anyway, a noncommissioned officer came down finally and told us to work our way down to where F Company was.

05:58.176 --> 06:05.466
And we were being shelled, but the shells were coming in sporadically enough that you could, between shells, you could work your way down to where F Company had crossed.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.268
And so I did that.

06:07.771 --> 06:12.681
I went about halfway down the hill, and I dug a shallow foxhole and climbed in the foxhole.

06:13.422 --> 06:18.733
And somewhere during that afternoon, they started trying to cross at F Company's position.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.636
But remember now, they do have cover.

06:20.677 --> 06:26.208
There's a house down there, a stone house, and they have a few boats behind it, so they have a modicum of cover.

06:26.228 --> 06:30.015
But it's daylight now, and the Germans are only about 100 yards away.

06:30.383 --> 06:34.329
And on top of that, they can't get but about one boat at a time down there.

06:34.349 --> 06:39.677
Well, I don't know how many they tried, because I was up the hill a little bit and I couldn't see it all, but nobody got across.

06:40.278 --> 06:47.408
I finally worked my way down to that house, and when I did, some poor joker had jumped overboard as the German machine gun fire comes in.

06:47.668 --> 06:50.873
The smart ones just bailed out and swam out.

06:51.258 --> 06:57.547
The lieutenant was trying to convince him to try again, and he, in no unspoken terms, told him, that was it.

06:57.727 --> 06:59.450
I'm not going to do it.

06:59.470 --> 07:02.554
And I think at that point, they decided they'd better wait until dark.

07:03.035 --> 07:05.418
That was the smartest thing they'd done all day.

07:05.598 --> 07:08.442
So we waited until dark, and I was in one of the first boats to get across.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.684
Poor old F Company.

07:09.704 --> 07:14.751
It turns out that the river was kind of, I mean, the hill was kind of like this, and the river was over here.

07:14.731 --> 07:17.015
And that hill gave you a little bit of cover.

07:17.215 --> 07:20.921
There was a little spot there where you could have some cover.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.506
And, you know, it came down and right here against it.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.870
So we worked our way down and we'd dig a hole.

07:26.890 --> 07:28.152
And the next guy would dig a hole.

07:28.453 --> 07:32.419
And we just worked our way down from F Company, extending the line.

07:33.800 --> 07:39.888
Turned out when morning came, the next morning, there was a boat right out there in the river with a dead GI and it just hunched over like that.

07:39.908 --> 07:43.412
I had no idea how that boat got there or how he was killed.

07:43.432 --> 07:45.855
Maybe he was one of the boats that actually made it across.

07:46.276 --> 07:48.859
But I thought, I was told that nobody made it across.

07:48.879 --> 07:51.562
Or maybe it was an accidental hit during the night or a lucky hit.

07:51.582 --> 07:53.885
Or maybe it was one of the initial F Company guys, I don't know.

07:54.786 --> 07:58.491
But the next day, they finally woke up and started smoking the hill.

07:59.416 --> 08:08.123
All my life I've thought, every time I see those pictures of those poor devils landing on Iwo Jima or D-Day, I think, wow, aren't they throwing smoke on them?

08:09.046 --> 08:12.075
Because with smoke, we could see and they couldn't.

08:12.663 --> 08:20.030
And so easily we continued to get men across until just about everybody that hadn't run away, some had run away, was across.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.032
But then a terrible thing happened.

08:22.052 --> 08:32.842
Just as this boat landed right behind my position, I mean, a little bit farther, but maybe 10 yards behind where I was sitting, the smoke cleared.

08:32.862 --> 08:33.623
There was a break.

08:33.683 --> 08:36.305
Maybe they ran out of shells for a minute.

08:36.325 --> 08:40.189
Well, the guys bailed out of the boat, and all of them made it but the last guy.

08:40.642 --> 08:43.967
And just as he started out, the German machine gun opened up.

08:43.987 --> 08:49.916
Well, he missed him, but instead of just charging on to safety, he hit the ground.

08:49.936 --> 08:51.659
And then the most terrible thing happened.

08:51.679 --> 08:53.181
That German machine gun opened up.

08:53.201 --> 08:57.929
And I know in the movies, you've watched machine guns make little spouts as they crawl across the ground.

08:58.369 --> 09:01.915
Well, that machine gun just drew a line right over his body.

09:01.935 --> 09:04.759
And I sat there just looking at him just like that, and I said, he's dead.

09:05.363 --> 09:16.923
Would you believe that that guy, when that burst was over, that guy got up and dashed to safety, didn't have a scratch on him, but he fell down just sobbing hysterically.

09:16.943 --> 09:25.718
I mean, he was absolutely... He knew that it was just by the grace of God that his bullet-riddled corpse wasn't lying out there in that little piece of ground.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.962
It's interesting because you told me that...

09:28.432 --> 09:35.401
There probably would have been more lives lost in the war had the people who were shooting the guns been a little bit more skilled at shooting the guns.

09:35.441 --> 09:38.125
A lot of the gunfire was just sort of helter-skelter.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.988
But this guy was firing from safety up there.

09:40.008 --> 09:42.651
He probably was in a well-concealed position, see?

09:43.092 --> 09:45.655
And he was just sitting up there taking target practice.

09:45.735 --> 09:47.337
And he was dead on.

09:47.357 --> 09:50.001
His bullets just crawled right across that guy's body.

09:49.981 --> 09:53.204
How he missed him, I do not know.

09:53.224 --> 09:54.986
It was just one of those things.

09:55.006 --> 09:58.749
Well, we finally got enough men across that we did assault the position.

09:59.350 --> 10:02.052
And it went well, because we just stormed the position.

10:02.072 --> 10:04.354
And when we reached the top, the Germans had run.

10:04.374 --> 10:07.357
There were a lot of woods, and I saw one dead German, and that was all.

10:07.377 --> 10:10.600
But the woods closed down your visibility to a few feet.

10:10.620 --> 10:17.406
Well, we spun around and headed down the parallel to the river to clean the Germans off.

10:18.010 --> 10:23.726
And I had an automatic rifle at the time, Browning Automatic Rifle, which fired 20 bullets, full automatic.

10:25.070 --> 10:28.560
And I put myself up at the far end, which was the most dangerous spot.

10:28.743 --> 10:31.568
But I really thought they'd want my firepower up there.

10:31.588 --> 10:33.952
But the lieutenant came up and told me to move down the line.

10:34.012 --> 10:35.796
Well, as I told you, I want to know why.

10:36.337 --> 10:40.785
And so I argued with him, and so I got a few curse words, and I obeyed.

10:40.825 --> 10:42.908
I did obey all of them after I was properly cursed.

10:44.471 --> 10:45.433
So I went down the line.

10:45.473 --> 10:47.617
Well, we started forward, and I don't know how far we went.

10:48.138 --> 10:49.560
But all of a sudden, we hit fire.

10:49.581 --> 10:51.544
I mean, it was obvious that we'd run into the Germans.

10:51.997 --> 11:18.814
i opened up and was raking the front of me with my gun and advancing and i suddenly realized i was not getting any fire so i just moved forward by myself i was on my own now and i just moved forward and i came to the edge of the woods and i looked and no farther than oh probably 10 yards away there was a big stone maybe a couple of big stones there and so i crawled on my stomach up to get behind those stones nobody even knew i'd done it

11:19.705 --> 11:22.669
It turns out that my life wasn't worth a plug nickel.

11:22.689 --> 11:27.254
I was actually crawling in plain view of the Germans who were no more than 20 yards away.

11:27.274 --> 11:33.943
But most of our fire was farther up the hill, and they were looking up the hill and not looking down where I was.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.506
And so when I crawled on my stomach, they didn't see me.

11:36.566 --> 11:39.509
Now, I could have dashed and made it, but then they would have known I was there.

11:40.010 --> 11:42.333
Now, because I crawled, they didn't know I was there.

11:43.394 --> 11:47.299
Well, I looked around this rock, and all of a sudden I saw the smoke from a gun.

11:48.005 --> 11:50.127
from behind some bushes.

11:50.147 --> 11:52.570
There was a lot of bushes, wooded.

11:52.590 --> 11:55.292
And I looked very carefully and I saw a human head.

11:55.312 --> 11:57.174
So I just propped up like this.

11:57.194 --> 12:01.859
I put his head right on my front sight and said to myself, I'm about to kill a man and I pulled the trigger.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.602
Well down he went, needless to say.

12:05.083 --> 12:09.247
And then I just raked the German position and I screamed to the other guys where they were.

12:09.907 --> 12:13.371
And another guy crawled up beside me and we both were raking that position.

12:13.638 --> 12:21.773
And then at that point, I got what was almost like a wound in that I lost a big part of my hearing in my right ear for the rest of my life.

12:21.793 --> 12:26.581
This guy had crawled up right beside me, and I had emptied my automatic rifle.

12:26.601 --> 12:30.769
And I was in the process of reloading when three Germans jumped up and made a break for him.

12:31.694 --> 12:36.682
This guy throws up his rifle with a muzzle about that far from my ear and goes bam, bam, bam.

12:37.503 --> 12:37.884
Oh, my.

12:37.904 --> 12:38.826
Good golly.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.468
I was stoned there for a while.

12:40.508 --> 12:41.049
And guess what?

12:41.209 --> 12:42.291
He missed all three times.

12:42.572 --> 12:43.673
And several other people fired.

12:43.693 --> 12:45.596
You talk about saving lives.

12:45.616 --> 12:49.503
Those three Germans got away, and they were not over 20, 25 yards away.

12:49.723 --> 12:51.025
And you lost part of your hearing.

12:51.045 --> 12:51.947
And I lost part of my hearing.

12:51.987 --> 12:54.310
I was the only casualty, it turned out.

12:54.331 --> 12:58.377
But anyway, we kept firing at the German position, and the rest of them surrendered.

12:58.795 --> 13:00.177
So we did achieve that.

13:00.197 --> 13:03.323
We eliminated the German position without any more losses.

13:03.343 --> 13:07.010
I've always said that this was probably my finest moment on the front.

13:07.110 --> 13:10.696
I've seen guys get Bronze Stars for less, but that's okay.

13:10.716 --> 13:12.599
We were too busy fighting to think about.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.184
We were too busy staying alive to think about.

13:15.164 --> 13:17.067
But boring things like that at the time.

13:17.227 --> 13:24.598
We mentioned last week, and we alluded to it now, that you came away from your service, fortunately, without a Purple Heart.

13:24.979 --> 13:26.501
Nobody wants to earn one of those.

13:26.982 --> 13:33.932
But without the significant awards that you hear about, like the Bronze Star Medal and things like that, does that bother you?

13:34.621 --> 13:35.282
Not really.

13:35.302 --> 13:36.523
Oh, I would have liked to have gotten it.

13:36.563 --> 13:38.185
I have that much ego.

13:38.205 --> 13:45.353
But you do get a little cynical because guys like outfits like I was in will see more danger in a day than some other units see in a month.

13:45.794 --> 13:52.141
And yet you'd be surprised how many guys in headquarters company and how many officers actually do have medals.

13:52.161 --> 13:54.984
And so you know that it's not being equitably distributed.

13:55.044 --> 13:57.827
And part of it, though, really is simply that

13:57.807 --> 14:03.213
What is very heroic for somebody in headquarters company is day's work in a rifle company.

14:04.014 --> 14:04.554
That's the thing.

14:06.456 --> 14:06.597
Indeed.

14:06.617 --> 14:23.595
Last week we talked about the Battle of the Bulge and the weather and the cold and it was this cold and the brutal attack that your feet took because of the cold that eventually ended your military career.

14:23.575 --> 14:24.337
Talk about that.

14:24.357 --> 14:29.651
Well, I got a blister on a long walk up to the shore, up to the Sour River, actually.

14:29.671 --> 14:35.707
And I would have probably gone to the medics, except I'd gone to the medics before when I had my stomach trouble and they'd just laughed at me more or less.

14:35.727 --> 14:37.672
So I figured, well, I can't know you shouldn't go on with blisters.

14:38.154 --> 14:38.715
Made a mistake.

14:39.505 --> 14:43.152
And my feet were already beginning to get a little numb from the cold.

14:43.172 --> 14:49.585
But after about a week, my blisters had gotten so bad that if I warmed my feet up, I couldn't walk.

14:49.606 --> 14:55.437
In fact, a few days after we got across the river, we attacked a little town of Beesdorf, Germany.

14:55.457 --> 14:58.223
Boy, that was a savage fight that I don't have time to talk about.

14:58.540 --> 15:06.551
But after we had just about cleaned that town up, I put on some warm socks, and my feet were so terrible that I went down to the company aid station.

15:07.212 --> 15:09.075
And I went in there, and the guy said, what do you want?

15:09.095 --> 15:10.957
And I told him, he said, get the H out of here.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.559
We got dying men in here.

15:12.579 --> 15:17.126
So I went on for two more weeks and lost another foxhole in the process.

15:17.146 --> 15:25.257
Incidentally, that day that I was talking about, that I just finished talking about, my second foxhole buddy was killed on that train.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.155
fighting our way down that ridge.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.038
So that was my second foxhole buddy.

15:30.058 --> 15:31.079
I didn't find out about it.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.622
In the woods, we'd gotten separated.

15:32.642 --> 15:34.825
Besides, the lieutenant had run me down the hill.

15:35.205 --> 15:37.309
And that's when I got separated from the foxhole buddy.

15:38.090 --> 15:42.456
And so I didn't know until after the battle, really, that he'd been killed.

15:42.476 --> 15:43.618
But anyway, I went on.

15:43.658 --> 15:48.966
And towards the end, every time I took a step, blood and pus were literally squashing in my shoes.

15:49.503 --> 15:57.957
I think I told you about what finally did me in when we fought all the way through the Siegfried Line and they gave us a bath.

15:57.977 --> 16:00.361
Hadn't had my clothes off for nearly two months.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.104
Filthy dirty, of course.

16:02.644 --> 16:05.589
And what they did is they had this tent with a shower in it.

16:05.890 --> 16:08.414
You took off all your clothes and threw it in a pile.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.756
Huge pile of clothes.

16:09.989 --> 16:13.315
You went in there, and you got five minutes of water and soap.

16:13.335 --> 16:22.071
When the five minutes were over, you walked out, you dried yourself, and there was another huge pile of clean clothes, probably from the guys that had been bathed the day before.

16:22.792 --> 16:29.584
When I got dressed and tried to put my shoes on, it was agony, because now I had that warm water, and boy, howdy.

16:30.172 --> 16:58.643
and those blisters were awful I had red infection lines running all the way to my knees and around the blisters they were about that big and bleeding and they were black about that big around them so the next day I hobbled down to battalion aid station and I kind of convinced him that I had to fix those feet before I fought anymore so he put a bandage on me and sent me back to division aid and that doctor saw my feet and said you've got trench foot and I went back to England

16:59.855 --> 17:10.513
I think I told you the story about how when I got down there, there was a guy from Beaumont, Texas, and I got to talking about him, told him I had a brother in the medics, told him what unit my brother was in, and he said, they're only a mile up the road here.

17:11.254 --> 17:15.361
And he got the chaplain, and the chaplain asked me how long it had been since I'd seen him.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.684
I told him two years.

17:17.104 --> 17:22.874
He went and got my brother, and he brought him back, and we visited all night long until I was flown out the next day to England.

17:22.894 --> 17:24.597
That was the end of war for me, of course.

17:24.577 --> 17:30.089
I've skipped an awful lot of fighting here, but I know we don't have that much time and we have to talk about keelhaul.

17:30.209 --> 17:31.432
Let's do that now.

17:31.813 --> 17:41.012
Operation Keelhaul, without me going a lot into it, because I'll be honest, I had not been familiar with this until you told me about it the other day.

17:41.513 --> 17:44.560
I got on the internet and educated myself more about

17:44.540 --> 17:51.049
about Operation Keelhaul, which was referred to in what I read as forced repatriation.

17:51.069 --> 17:51.770
That's what it was.

17:52.992 --> 17:56.336
You participated in Operation Keelhaul.

17:56.356 --> 17:56.997
I did indeed.

17:57.478 --> 18:02.645
Something that you're not necessarily proud of, but you were a young man following order.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.009
At the time, I didn't give a hang, but it's been bothering my conscience ever since.

18:06.630 --> 18:09.755
Tell people what Operation Keelhaul was.

18:09.895 --> 18:13.720
If you were a Russian and Stalin was killing your people,

18:13.700 --> 18:15.102
Where could you flee?

18:15.122 --> 18:18.886
You've got to remember that Stalin killed more Ukrainians than Hitler did Jews.

18:18.906 --> 18:21.189
At least as many, and some say more.

18:21.209 --> 18:23.592
And so he killed about a fourth of all Ukrainians.

18:24.453 --> 18:27.536
And Ukrainians, by the millions, had fled.

18:27.556 --> 18:28.838
But where can you go but Germany?

18:29.218 --> 18:36.687
It doesn't make you a Nazi any more than a Jew fleeing Germany and taking refuge in Russia as a communist.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.471
Both of those are illegitimate assumptions.

18:39.931 --> 18:43.937
So Germany was full of Russian refugees.

18:44.858 --> 18:49.604
Now it is true that some Russians were fighting in the German army too just because they hated Stalin so much.

18:49.925 --> 18:52.468
But most of these people that I'm talking about were just civilians.

18:52.788 --> 18:53.950
Women and children too.

18:54.190 --> 18:54.791
Oh yeah.

18:54.811 --> 19:03.703
Anyway, we were called out one Sunday morning, given ammunition, and the captain got up and explained that these Russians had taken refuge in a church.

19:04.173 --> 19:07.279
And they said they were going to die there rather than go back to Russia and die.

19:07.760 --> 19:14.714
But we have audits from the top that we are going to take them and put them on trucks and ship them out of there.

19:14.734 --> 19:18.061
And we're going to do it even if we have to kill them.

19:18.081 --> 19:18.943
Ship them back to Russia.

19:18.963 --> 19:21.388
We're going to kill them if we had to, but they were going to go back.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.840
So down we go to the church, and they had taken refuge inside.

19:25.980 --> 19:31.206
It was a fence around it, and they put me and another soldier on the guard at the gate.

19:31.507 --> 19:34.511
There were two or three gates, and they put two soldiers on each gate.

19:34.531 --> 19:35.912
The rest of the guys went inside.

19:36.193 --> 19:38.556
A battle royal broke out with rifle butts.

19:38.616 --> 19:39.397
They were fighting.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.981
In fact, the Orthodox priest in there was swinging his cross, it turned out.

19:44.143 --> 19:47.167
But he got a rifle butt in his face.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.009
Some poor woman had a heart attack.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.392
They finally drove them all out of the church.

19:52.199 --> 19:54.084
A couple of them made a break for it.

19:54.364 --> 19:55.086
Two of them were shot.

19:55.146 --> 20:00.740
In fact, one of them, a whole group, started around the corner running right towards me and the other soldier that was with me.

20:01.121 --> 20:07.035
And when they got about, I'd say, 15 feet, 20 feet away...

20:07.640 --> 20:13.187
There was a shot rang from the courtyard, and about a 16-year-old boy crumpled to the ground right in front of my face.

20:13.628 --> 20:20.257
My buddy and I threw our rifles up, and I hate to say it, but I was about to fire point blank into those people when they stopped.

20:20.277 --> 20:23.822
Now, this is the line that got my letter published in the Wall Street Journal.

20:24.102 --> 20:33.715
The Wall Street Journal, in 1983, published an editorial about Operation Keelhaul that had been kept secret by the government because it was a disgrace that they wanted to cover up.

20:34.623 --> 20:38.389
And finally, they'd gotten the information through the Freedom of Information Act.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.413
And the Wall Street Journal wrote this editorial.

20:40.513 --> 20:44.019
I wrote this letter, and they published it, and I got an enormous response.

20:44.399 --> 20:51.992
But the title of the letter was, that the Wall Street Journal put on, was it, I thought Americans were good.

20:52.012 --> 20:54.977
When these poor Russian refugees stopped, no farther than...

20:55.936 --> 20:57.138
from you to me.

20:57.158 --> 20:59.643
And I was sitting there with my gun pointing at them.

20:59.663 --> 21:09.442
A little Russian lady, I would guess 50, 55 years old, with tears running down her face, looked at me and said, I thought Americans were good.

21:09.463 --> 21:15.835
And I just yelled at her to shut up and we drove them into the center of the courtyard and by force loaded them on the trucks.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.950
After it was over, we all marched away.

21:18.371 --> 21:20.935
Everybody was having just like we'd had an outing or a picnic.

21:21.316 --> 21:25.222
And nobody ever, ever said anything like we'd done anything wrong.

21:25.242 --> 21:31.392
And the truth of it is we'd done exactly what the Germans did when they loaded Jews on the boxcars and sent them to the death camps.

21:31.412 --> 21:34.617
Because Stalin probably killed most of those people.

21:34.637 --> 21:38.363
Fortunately, a lot of them got away on purpose.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.773
And you were glad about that.

21:40.813 --> 21:42.898
I was very glad when I learned it.

21:42.918 --> 21:45.124
One of the mistakes they made, we were combat soldiers.

21:45.164 --> 21:46.367
We were hard as nails.

21:46.467 --> 21:50.097
I mean, you haven't heard half of the stories of what I went through, for instance.

21:50.658 --> 21:52.944
And human life got cheap.

21:52.964 --> 21:56.132
They shouldn't use combat soldiers for police work.

21:56.112 --> 22:06.543
I got a fascinating letter from a KP, KP, I mean an MP, excuse me, an MP who was in charge of a camp where a lot of these people were.

22:07.004 --> 22:16.534
And he told how he had stalled and stonewalled for a couple of months until finally, and the Russians would come and demand them and he would have some excuse and they'd come again a week later.

22:16.814 --> 22:19.757
He'd have another excuse and he never sent his people back.

22:20.868 --> 22:22.592
But, you know, that was a military policeman.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.875
He had a better feel for it.

22:23.915 --> 22:31.813
We were just, see, we all, we had been told, we were told by the captain that Stalin had told Roosevelt.

22:31.873 --> 22:36.644
Roosevelt, see, had agreed to this at Yalta, had told Roosevelt that they wouldn't be harmed.

22:36.664 --> 22:39.771
And when he said that, a laugh ran through the whole unit.

22:40.612 --> 22:41.693
We knew better than that.

22:42.013 --> 22:43.195
We knew better than that in 1945.

22:43.255 --> 22:45.417
We were a bunch of kids and we knew better than that.

22:45.717 --> 22:47.599
How could Roosevelt not have known?

22:47.719 --> 22:49.001
How could Truman not have known?

22:49.101 --> 22:50.522
How could Eisenhower not have known?

22:50.883 --> 22:53.565
Three presidents of the United States were executing that.

22:54.426 --> 22:55.628
Roosevelt had agreed to it.

22:56.228 --> 22:57.870
Truman was president when it happened.

22:58.190 --> 23:02.995
And Eisenhower was supreme commander in the European theater and had to order it done.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.056
Were the Brits involved too?

23:04.076 --> 23:05.858
Oh yeah.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.420
Churchill agreed to it too.

23:07.500 --> 23:07.820
Oh yeah.

23:08.381 --> 23:08.661
Oh yeah.

23:09.029 --> 23:10.091
You know what I really think?

23:10.612 --> 23:17.303
I think the attitude, World War II, people who talk about today just don't understand war.

23:18.004 --> 23:24.495
World War II was so bloody that I don't think anybody really cared what Stalin did to his people.

23:24.835 --> 23:27.139
If Stalin wants to kill his people, that's his concern.

23:28.958 --> 23:41.825
See, one of the excuses given, I told you this, one of the excuses given for why we carried it out was the fact that the Germans had put most of the American and British prisoners of war in camps in Poland.

23:41.845 --> 23:45.452
So if they escaped, they'd have to go so very, very far to get out.

23:45.933 --> 23:48.739
As a result, they were liberated by the Russians.

23:48.719 --> 23:58.976
And so the story goes is that we were fearful that if we did not at least go through the motion of returning these Russian refugees, they wouldn't return our prisons of war.

23:58.996 --> 24:07.690
I don't think such an agreement was ever made, such a threat was ever made, and I don't think that, as a matter of fact, I think they did return, certainly most of our prisons of war.

24:08.170 --> 24:13.579
I've heard a few stories about some that supposedly did not get back, but for the most part they did.

24:13.559 --> 24:16.282
And so it was never put to the test, really.

24:16.302 --> 24:19.105
But you can see that they would have been concerned about that.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.449
But there's nothing that excuses that.

24:23.030 --> 24:25.773
Because we knew what was going to happen to those people.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.175
It's an amazing story.

24:28.496 --> 24:32.801
And if people want to hear more about the story, you can do what I did.

24:32.861 --> 24:40.309
You can go to any search engine on the Internet and type in Operation Keelhaul, K-E-E-L-H-A-U-L.

24:40.627 --> 24:42.229
And hear more about it.

24:42.570 --> 24:49.298
And I know that you personally have battled with guilt since then.

24:49.318 --> 24:49.599
Oh, yeah.

24:49.639 --> 24:53.464
I used to tell people I served in the American Gestapo.

24:53.484 --> 24:54.725
I haven't done that in a long time.

24:54.745 --> 24:59.732
But back in, say, about in the 50s, I'd tell people that I served in the American Gestapo.

25:00.303 --> 25:02.508
Want to move on because we've only got a couple of minutes left.

25:02.889 --> 25:04.453
Dick Davison is our guest.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.400
You and your wife, Joy, will celebrate your 55th wedding anniversary.

25:07.441 --> 25:08.122
On July 7th.

25:08.784 --> 25:09.245
Coming up.

25:09.526 --> 25:13.796
As people are seeing this, it's already happened.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.019
So congratulations.

25:15.039 --> 25:18.227
You all have two daughters and a son that I know you're very proud of.

25:18.207 --> 25:23.512
Dick, you're fighting another battle right now that you just found out about just recently.

25:23.753 --> 25:24.594
Yeah, about three months ago.

25:24.614 --> 25:25.835
And you've agreed to talk about it.

25:25.995 --> 25:32.502
And talk about it in terms of, tell them what your battle is, but your amazing attitude in the face of it.

25:32.542 --> 25:34.624
I'll let you speak of that, but you know.

25:35.164 --> 25:36.326
Well, it is, and people can tell.

25:36.366 --> 25:41.651
Well, you know, it's given unto man once to die, and after that's the judgment, and I am 80 years old.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.694
So one simply has to be philosophical about it.

25:44.714 --> 25:46.476
We do believe in a life hereafter.

25:46.625 --> 25:47.266
I would go there.

25:47.286 --> 25:50.172
If I didn't go there for the... I have lung cancer, by the way.

25:51.776 --> 25:53.619
Very likely it's terminal.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.784
Only by the grace of God it won't be.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.427
Hopefully I'll last a few years.

25:57.548 --> 25:58.169
That's possible.

25:59.031 --> 25:59.672
But...

26:01.289 --> 26:06.900
Fundamentally, I'm going to, at least when I feel good, I'm getting chemo, so there are days when I don't feel too good.

26:06.920 --> 26:11.569
But when I feel good, I'm simply going to live my life and simply be useful.

26:11.589 --> 26:12.591
I like to be useful.

26:12.851 --> 26:18.142
I feel, in fact, I get more pleasure out of being useful sometimes than I do out of having fun, you know.

26:18.803 --> 26:23.432
And so that's my attitude, Tom, and I could say maybe

26:23.412 --> 26:25.455
I'm still feeling relatively good.

26:25.495 --> 26:30.642
And I'll admit that when I do feel sick, things do get a little bit blacker.

26:30.662 --> 26:32.365
I'm having a pretty good day today.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.167
Indeed you are.

26:34.187 --> 26:39.555
And we can only hope that you're blessed with many, many, many more good days.

26:39.575 --> 26:41.157
And thank you for your service, Dick Davison.

26:41.177 --> 26:41.998
And we're out of time.

26:42.038 --> 26:46.244
But thank you for your service and truly an incredible story of service.

26:46.264 --> 26:46.885
Thank you, Tom.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.087
I've enjoyed it very much.

26:48.742 --> 27:15.238
After Dr. Dick Davison served his country in World War II he continued to serve as a professor of engineering at Texas A&M for 45 years he and his wife Joy have been married for 55 years and as you've heard you've heard that same courage that he needed more than 60 years ago serves him today in a different kind of battle he has shared his story and that's our honor to have heard it. We salute Dr. Dick Davison for his service as we salute all veterans

27:15.218 --> 27:16.800
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:16.820 --> 27:19.492
