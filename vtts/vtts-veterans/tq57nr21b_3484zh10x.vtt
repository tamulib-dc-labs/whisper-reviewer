00:30.582 --> 00:34.217
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.237 --> 00:35.539
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.262 --> 00:40.708
When Texas Aggies go to war, it's a story that certainly can't be told in 30 minutes.

00:41.248 --> 00:48.798
Indeed, it would take a year's worth of Veterans of the Valley shows to tell these stories of bravery and of service.

00:48.818 --> 00:54.465
Well, last week, we visited with Texas A&M Professor Emeritus Henry Dethloff.

00:54.485 --> 01:05.880
His latest book is titled Texas Aggies Go to War, the story of Texas A&M students and former students who served our country in every conflict, starting with the Spanish-American War.

01:06.215 --> 01:10.344
service that continues today in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

01:10.825 --> 01:15.295
Henry C. Dethloff rejoins us on Veterans of the Valley, and it's a pleasure to have you back.

01:15.615 --> 01:19.684
We talked a lot last week about the book, about how the book came about.

01:19.917 --> 01:23.242
We talked about Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II.

01:23.723 --> 01:25.827
Had to bring you back because there's other wars.

01:25.847 --> 01:27.550
There are other Aggies who have served.

01:27.570 --> 01:31.536
First off, by way of review, let's talk about the book, sort of how it came to be.

01:31.897 --> 01:36.004
And it's just part of one segment of a larger project that you all are talking about.

01:36.064 --> 01:36.324
Right.

01:36.805 --> 01:42.955
I think it's sort of the pivotal part, having been a co-author with John A. Adams of the book.

01:42.935 --> 01:45.759
But we're planning to do documentaries.

01:45.799 --> 01:54.092
We're doing a web page right now, incidentally, by which people can enroll and basically indicate their past service.

01:54.492 --> 02:02.344
And hopefully in the future we'll do a published book of those who served listing essentially those Aggies who've been in military service.

02:02.324 --> 02:08.493
As a matter of fact, I'd like right now at the outset, and then maybe we can later to put a website up on the screen if we can.

02:08.533 --> 02:09.715
You talked about those who served.

02:09.755 --> 02:14.121
It's a directory and record of Texas Aggies in military service since 1898.

02:14.141 --> 02:17.065
And as you said, edited by David A. Chapman.

02:17.606 --> 02:20.350
And that website, I believe that we can get on the screen.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.552
And there it is, right there.

02:21.813 --> 02:24.738
It's a little long, so we'll hold it up there so people can write it down.

02:25.059 --> 02:27.202
And we'll try to get it back on before the end of the show.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.064
Now continue.

02:28.084 --> 02:28.284
Go ahead.

02:28.304 --> 02:28.805
Thank you.

02:29.066 --> 02:36.599
And I hope people will take the opportunity to register for themselves or friends and family who have been in service.

02:36.800 --> 02:44.734
Probably my guesstimate is that some 50,000 Texas Aggies have been in military service since 1898.

02:44.714 --> 02:47.779
And of course, it continues today, as you had mentioned.

02:48.381 --> 02:56.976
20,000 served in World War II, 14,500 or so of those were officers, 29 generals, seven Medal of Honor winners.

02:57.397 --> 03:01.604
The Aggie record in war is truly a remarkable and incredible record.

03:02.085 --> 03:04.810
And it is a record of service.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.376
And incidentally, I would like again to thank

03:08.356 --> 03:18.614
former President Bush for his introduction forward to the book because that is the key motive or key to the whole book, the idea of service.

03:18.654 --> 03:25.065
Aggies have served their country well from 1898 and are still doing so today.

03:25.045 --> 03:48.437
the service of course we think of usually is with the larger wars that we we see and hear about all the time but when you really start looking at the historical record we have been involved in in great and small wars most of our existence i suppose and in fact i did a brief count there's a table in the book

03:48.417 --> 04:03.709
showing the wars, the engagements, the encounters, I guess you would say, in which the United States forces have been engaged since 1945, and there are over 45 military engagements or encounters, all of which

04:04.212 --> 04:09.961
in which Aggies have participated between 1945 and the year 2000.

04:10.041 --> 04:32.194
So the Great War, as we usually think of, I suppose, are, well, the Spanish-American War, great certainly in its consequences, World War I and World War II, and then we think of Korea and Vietnam, but there were constant engagements and encounters that we tend to forget about, and in most of those situations, I would say in every one of those situations,

04:32.174 --> 04:36.920
Texas Aggies are participants in service of their country.

04:36.940 --> 04:41.146
I'd like to thank, again, the sponsors of this book, C.C.

04:41.166 --> 04:46.473
Taylor and Major General William A. Becker, Jim Nelson, and Bill Lundquist.

04:46.493 --> 04:53.001
And they have inspired the writing of the book and the work that's going on here.

04:52.981 --> 05:10.057
They also have basically endowed the author in the press, I suppose, such that royalties from the book, all royalties from this book, sale of the book, will go to a eternal Aggies Corps of Cadet endowment fund.

05:10.077 --> 05:16.503
And they are interested, of course, in helping and supporting the Corps of Cadets because it's a magnificent record.

05:16.523 --> 05:22.549
And that fund is managed by the Texas A&M University Research Foundation.

05:22.529 --> 05:26.434
It's been a pleasure to me, I suppose.

05:26.514 --> 05:35.785
It's been a lot of work, but it's been an exciting and challenging thing to try to record the highlights, and I wish we could have done a lot more.

05:35.845 --> 05:42.933
Every individual that's mentioned in that book probably has a book into and of themselves.

05:44.074 --> 05:47.218
So there are a lot of books, hopefully, that one day will come out of all of this.

05:47.318 --> 05:48.179
It'll spurn from this.

05:48.239 --> 05:50.221
As you were talking, we showed the jacket of the book.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.523
It's quite a handsome book.

05:51.841 --> 05:56.673
I have the honor of having one, as a matter of fact, myself here, and it's certainly going into my library.

05:57.014 --> 06:00.022
As you can tell, I've been doing a lot of studying and a lot of bookmarking here.

06:01.145 --> 06:04.594
Let's sort of pick up where we left off last week.

06:04.634 --> 06:08.905
Korea, it's called the Forgotten War, but over 2000 Aggies fought

06:09.290 --> 06:10.192
in the Korean War.

06:10.212 --> 06:16.302
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant Bob Middleton is a guest that we've had here on Veterans of the Valley and he's a person that you write about in the book too.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.748
Talk about Korea and the Aggies and how the two related.

06:20.249 --> 06:25.999
Well, we forget so fast and I do, I'm certainly guilty of that.

06:25.979 --> 06:31.006
But remember, the Korean War began really back in 1948, in a sense.

06:31.787 --> 06:34.231
Syngman Rhee was elected president of Korea.

06:34.912 --> 06:42.002
Korea was divided between basically Russian surveillance and American surveillance after the end of World War II.

06:42.642 --> 06:47.329
And with the election of Syngman Rhee and a democratic government in the South,

06:47.309 --> 07:12.844
uh there was conflict developing with the rest of the world, let's say Russia and China and whomever. In any event uh North Korea attacked South Korea in June 1950 and president Harry S Truman at the time ordered American forces in to the relief of South Korea. I want to stop you right there just a second because we're showing a picture. We referred to Bob Middleton who you referred to in your book.

07:12.824 --> 07:15.087
This is a photograph of Bob Middleton.

07:15.107 --> 07:16.288
He is on the right.

07:16.309 --> 07:18.291
Lieutenant Ken Shockey is on the left.

07:18.311 --> 07:19.973
They are both former Texas Aggies.

07:20.013 --> 07:27.283
They met up in Korea, and it's quite a story that, as a matter of fact, he told just a couple of weeks ago right here on Veterans of the Valley.

07:27.683 --> 07:30.707
Pretty amazing story, and he lives right here in Bryan College Station.

07:30.747 --> 07:31.408
Bob Middleton does.

07:31.428 --> 07:34.512
Yes, I've had correspondents and assistants from

07:34.492 --> 08:00.752
from Bob Middleton. Indeed, indeed, I get to see him about every week because he's a big fan of A&M basketball and I see him at the basketball. Okay. So he's he's quite active in the community. Go ahead. Well we had uh uh a lot of troops in in Korea and uh the uh probably one of the highlights, I suppose, of the Aggie experience, one Aggie experience anyway, was was at Incheon when well

08:01.255 --> 08:04.058
when American forces were surrounded.

08:04.078 --> 08:14.769
In the early phases of the war, after American troops arrived, we were successful in basically driving North Korean armies northward and, in fact, as far northward as the Yalu River.

08:15.389 --> 08:26.060
I don't know if this is appropriate to air, but I had a memo from one former Aggie who said we had driven basically the North Koreans across the Yalu River.

08:26.140 --> 08:26.841
We were

08:26.821 --> 08:32.089
if you will, peeing in the Yalu River one moment and fleeing the next moment back to Seoul.

08:32.590 --> 08:45.731
Northern, they were invaded, they were struck suddenly by an onslaught of Chinese forces and American allied forces reeled all the way back, of course, into the till, basically, of South Korea.

08:45.752 --> 08:54.145
And a lot of American forces got caught in the melee that followed, including at the Incheon Reservoir, Marines were caught behind the lines

08:54.445 --> 09:06.335
And Colonel Raymond Murray, prominently then Colonel, was one of the troop leaders who helped extricate Marines from an almost impossible situation.

09:06.716 --> 09:10.024
Murray was one of the most decorated

09:10.392 --> 09:16.879
Marines, one of the most decorated military personnel, I suppose, maybe of all time, from several wars.

09:17.459 --> 09:30.493
But incidentally, Murray probably, not probably, but Murray is the personification of a character, High Pockets, from Leon Uris' novel on Battle Cry.

09:32.175 --> 09:38.982
The reality, in a way, is even greater than the fictional accounts in Battle Cry.

09:38.962 --> 09:51.650
But we had an awful lot of officers and men who were in all sorts of positions in Korea, in helicopter forces, in food supply.

09:51.810 --> 09:56.160
As I mentioned before, Aggies, I think, were particularly proficient

09:56.140 --> 10:05.818
in a lot of military encounters because of their engineering expertise, because of their agricultural, their supply, their production expertise.

10:05.898 --> 10:17.119
And people, for example, like Fred Dollar, who was in food services at Texas A&M, Guy Malloy, these folks were key members

10:17.099 --> 10:21.284
personnel in supplying, sustaining, and maintaining a war effort.

10:21.565 --> 10:23.467
War is a very complicated process.

10:23.787 --> 10:29.134
It takes engineers, agriculture, scientists, and all sorts of people to really make it work.

10:29.354 --> 10:34.861
And Aggies were provided that kind of expertise to make modern war effective.

10:34.881 --> 10:36.943
You mentioned Colonel Guy S. Malloy.

10:37.304 --> 10:44.693
He actually graduated from West Point in 1927, but he was the commandant for Texas A&M from 1946 to 1948.

10:44.673 --> 10:51.904
And he was among, I'm reading from your book now, among the first American combat commanders to arrive in Korea.

10:51.924 --> 10:59.034
He had a reputation as a strong disciplinarian and while at A&M made significant adjustments to the post-World War II Corps of Cadets.

10:59.074 --> 11:04.262
So he was quite a significant part of Texas A&M, even though he wasn't, unquote, an Aki.

11:04.282 --> 11:04.943
You bet.

11:05.083 --> 11:12.334
He had a tremendous impact on the development of the Corps of Cadets and of Texas A&M and indeed of the traditions and

11:13.023 --> 11:16.948
There are so many stories in your book of heroes, and there are so many names.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.931
You can only really have time to really talk about a few.

11:20.852 --> 11:31.485
Major John M. Cook, class of 1939, Lieutenant Stanley Tabor, 1945 class at A&M, members of the 19th Regiment, 24th Infantry Division.

11:32.046 --> 11:37.512
Talking about Major Cook, served in World War II as a paratrooper in the Philippine campaign.

11:37.778 --> 11:46.430
organized his men for counterattack and succeeded in knocking out several of the enemy positions with hand grenades until they were finally overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

11:46.971 --> 11:58.588
Cook, the Texas Aggie, the first Texas Aggie to be killed in the Korean War, died in hand-to-hand combat July 16, 1950, having killed one attacker with his pistol and another with his bayonet.

11:58.568 --> 12:08.808
Talking about Lieutenant Tabor, July the 26th, killed in action during the final engagement while attempting to help his injured commanding general, General William F. Dean, escape capture.

12:09.188 --> 12:11.393
Lots of heroes, lots of Aggies.

12:11.413 --> 12:17.124
Lots of incredible detail, and what they did is really an amazing story.

12:17.484 --> 12:19.328
Aggies produced...

12:19.983 --> 12:26.577
warriors in many ways, and it was a terrible, terrible war, and war is, I suppose, always that way.

12:26.597 --> 12:30.826
But they persevered, and they're continuing to do so today.

12:30.846 --> 12:38.683
Incidentally, I think in the class, speaking of Korea, class of 1951 contributed quite a number to the Korean War.

12:38.984 --> 12:54.949
As I recall, there were about 440 commissioned cadets in the class of 51, and roughly a little over half of those went to the Army, and incidentally, the other half went to the airports, roughly, and some of the Navy and all services.

12:55.470 --> 13:05.606
But one of the key individuals, both in Korea and later in Vietnam, incidentally, would have been General O.P.

13:05.626 --> 13:06.527
Weyland,

13:06.507 --> 13:30.473
and Wayland was an architect of really a modern and and very important tactic battlefield tactics the air land tactic basically by which helicopter support gunships and so forth work in very close collaboration with ground troops this had never really happened before right in warfare and and Wayland is really the key

13:30.453 --> 13:35.660
I think General Patton, I think I mentioned last time, called him the best damn general in the Air Force.

13:35.820 --> 13:41.848
As a matter of fact, I'll follow that up with reading from your book, General Whelan, class of 23, Texas A&M.

13:41.868 --> 13:43.730
In early 1952, General O.P.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.415
Whelan became commander of the UN's air operations in Korea.

13:47.495 --> 13:56.427
An airman's airman, Whelan had earned sterling reputation as a young brigadier general in 1944 across Europe in World War II and the Normandy landing.

13:56.744 --> 14:04.293
In Korea, Waylon was the major architect, like you said, of the air war plans that really revolutionized air-to-air and air-to-ground combat.

14:04.754 --> 14:05.234
Absolutely.

14:05.655 --> 14:20.313
So Aggies have contributed in many significant ways in combat and in every other way, supply, engineering, and I think in spirit and tradition and commitment.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.334
We talked...

14:21.601 --> 14:23.303
We've had Lieutenant Robert Middleton.

14:23.323 --> 14:24.185
We've talked about him.

14:24.245 --> 14:27.529
He was a member of that class of 1951 that you talked about.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.151
You talk about him in the book.

14:29.171 --> 14:38.825
Of course, he was a fellow that just sort of came off the farm and all of a sudden he found himself in charge of a platoon at Heartbreak Ridge.

14:38.845 --> 14:44.993
And he talked about the constant combat that he was in and told a very compelling story.

14:45.013 --> 14:47.336
As a matter of fact, you recount it here in the book.

14:47.717 --> 14:49.279
He told it here on Veterans of the Valley.

14:49.630 --> 14:53.736
said during one of the regular night nursery patrols, one man turned up missing.

14:53.836 --> 15:03.869
Two days later on a ridge some 2,000 yards from their position, the men of King Company saw a body staked out high on a ridge with his helmet on a stick beside him.

15:03.889 --> 15:04.771
It was their missing man.

15:05.211 --> 15:14.804
It was the worst display of arrogance, Middleton recalled, and everyone was devastated, mad as hell, and appalled that members of the same human race as ourselves could do such a thing.

15:14.824 --> 15:16.887
Heartbreak Ridge was appropriately named

15:16.867 --> 15:18.850
and war was indeed hell.

15:19.651 --> 15:23.776
He told that story here on Veterans of the Valley and to read it again, it's quite compelling.

15:24.277 --> 15:28.722
It is, it's just awesome and awful in many ways.

15:31.746 --> 15:44.022
One thing I think Americans need to keep in mind, we all need to keep in mind, is that there was really almost no end to war and confrontation and engagement

15:44.575 --> 15:48.339
from World War II to the present, of course, as we well know now.

15:48.359 --> 15:50.482
It's going on even today.

15:50.502 --> 16:08.642
And it is very important to have trained, committed, skilled, academically and otherwise military in service to the country, protecting our way of life and freedom and democracies that we cherish so greatly.

16:08.825 --> 16:10.407
There's a story that I wanted to get in.

16:10.568 --> 16:14.493
Your book is fascinating, by the way, and I want people to get it and read it.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.419
It concerns a Lieutenant James R. Holland, class of 50.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.684
Don't know if you remember writing about Lieutenant Holland or not.

16:21.704 --> 16:24.528
It says here, Lieutenant Holland died in action October the 8th, 1952.

16:25.710 --> 16:30.237
A letter from his mother to Dick Hervey of the Association of Former Students reads as follows.

16:30.958 --> 16:36.486
We received a letter from the commanding officer of the 7th Division confirming his death, but it is unbelievable.

16:36.888 --> 16:47.100
We noticed in James' return bank checks that he had sent your association of former students a gift, probably the last thing he did as it was dated about the time of his death.

16:47.941 --> 16:53.007
This was so like him, even from the battlefront, to remember he loved his school very much.

16:53.287 --> 16:53.648
They did.

16:53.868 --> 16:55.189
Aggies do and did.

16:55.710 --> 16:59.815
And that, too, is an incredible part of the Aggie story.

17:00.015 --> 17:06.242
And incidentally, most of the materials from the former Students' Association, we had available, made available to us.

17:06.923 --> 17:13.611
And I read through original letters from personnel overseas in the Mustard's

17:13.591 --> 17:18.758
during and after the wars at Bougainville, for example, and everywhere.

17:18.778 --> 17:27.871
And the personality, the commitment, the Aggie spirit really comes through in that material.

17:27.952 --> 17:32.037
It's really a very moving experience.

17:32.218 --> 17:40.189
Those materials are now in the Texas A&M University archives and are available, of course, for researchers to go and mine

17:40.169 --> 17:44.876
and find out too about your family and friends and so forth.

17:45.176 --> 17:46.418
It's an incredible collection.

17:46.818 --> 17:52.106
Before we leave Korea and get on to Vietnam, you also have lists in your book.

17:52.146 --> 17:59.396
Your book has a lot of lists, just fascinating lists of Texas A&M soldiers in the Korean War decorated.

17:59.896 --> 18:06.025
Some 13 who received the Silver Star, some 33 who received the Bronze Star, seven Purple Heart winners,

18:06.005 --> 18:09.390
and ten distinguished flying cross winners, all from the Korean War.

18:09.530 --> 18:16.501
And your research has come up with the name, the branch, and the class of each one of these.

18:16.581 --> 18:18.364
It's a fascinating list.

18:18.384 --> 18:19.706
We've tried to do as much as possible.

18:20.107 --> 18:24.774
Obviously, there are going to be a tremendous number of omissions, and that's the problem with anything like this.

18:24.794 --> 18:33.227
That's why we do hope people will take the opportunity to sign in, I guess, with the Aggie web page, with the directory, and so forth.

18:33.207 --> 18:35.049
Got a picture showing up on the screen.

18:35.069 --> 18:37.191
We're going to move along to Vietnam.

18:37.872 --> 18:38.593
Talk about this.

18:38.633 --> 18:40.595
This was the Wolfpack Muster.

18:40.615 --> 18:45.079
I'll come up with the names here in a minute, but sort of talk about what you remember about this photograph.

18:45.099 --> 18:47.301
Well, that was April the 21st, 1970.

18:47.962 --> 18:50.365
I hope I'm right on that date.

18:50.445 --> 18:52.607
I'll check you out here.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.409
This was the Wolfpack.

18:55.730 --> 19:01.476
A group of mostly Aggies in this air group.

19:01.456 --> 19:06.024
who decided to celebrate Aggie Muster Day in a way that was most unusual.

19:06.084 --> 19:13.156
They decided to essentially launch an attack, and they were, of course, approved happily by their superiors to do so.

19:13.517 --> 19:16.442
While they're up on the screen, I want to name them according to your book.

19:16.482 --> 19:21.811
I've got a picture from left to right, and I may mispronounce some of these names because some of them are kind of tough.

19:22.132 --> 19:25.017
First Lieutenant Ernie Petrash, Petrash,

19:24.997 --> 19:25.718
Class of 67.

19:26.019 --> 19:26.780
This is left to right.

19:27.081 --> 19:28.884
Captain Bill Clutes, Class of 65.

19:29.305 --> 19:31.750
Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bell, Class of 1953.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.032
That's the third one.

19:33.453 --> 19:33.854
Fourth one.

19:34.194 --> 19:36.799
First Lieutenant Lou, and I hope I'm pronouncing this right.

19:37.380 --> 19:42.049
Obadike, I believe it's Obadike, Class of 67.

19:42.309 --> 19:48.000
And Captain Al Rutina, R-U-T-Y-N-A.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.970
I apologize to him and his family if I mispronounce that class of 65.

19:52.612 --> 19:53.474
And here's an easy one.

19:53.515 --> 19:55.941
First Lieutenant Tom McKnight, class of 67.

19:56.182 --> 19:59.150
And this was quite a unique muster.

19:59.170 --> 20:02.218
And you got the date right, April 21st, 1970.

20:02.259 --> 20:03.542
It was known as the Wolf Pack.

20:04.062 --> 20:09.628
Like you said, stationed at Yuban Royal Thai Air Force Base in Southeast Thailand.

20:09.648 --> 20:21.981
And this all Aggie mission was provided with maintenance from Texas Aggies Major Jim Earl, James Albritton, class of 54, and Captain Lynn Tobias, class of 62.

20:22.041 --> 20:26.686
So this whole mission was pretty much heavy with Aggies.

20:26.766 --> 20:33.613
It talks about Mr. Pounds, talked about Herbert Pounds,

20:34.133 --> 20:36.696
was circling the target.

20:37.076 --> 20:41.621
Pounds marked the target bridge with a smoke rocket and radioed the Aggie attackers to hit my smoke.

20:42.261 --> 20:49.248
They eliminated the target and all returned to the U-Bahn Officers Club for a formal dinner, muster gathering, and roll call of the absent.

20:49.428 --> 20:58.277
The three pilots and their three back seaters collectively amassed 1,401 combat missions and 16 DFCs.

20:58.317 --> 20:58.838
Pretty amazing.

20:58.998 --> 21:00.900
It's an amazing story.

21:00.880 --> 21:12.974
The attack was along the trail, you know, where supplies and troops were being fed in from Cambodia, and we were trying to block that access to Vietnam.

21:13.694 --> 21:17.819
And, of course, that was the plague in the whole war, essentially.

21:17.839 --> 21:24.487
But it was an important mission, and it was also a memorable mission, particularly coming on Muster Day in 1970.

21:24.827 --> 21:25.808
Right, right.

21:25.788 --> 21:29.512
One Aggie that I wanted to mention, Lieutenant D.P.

21:29.572 --> 21:31.114
Pat Payne, class of 65.

21:32.315 --> 21:44.208
A book that I have read and a movie that I have seen, I think is probably one of the best books and movies about Vietnam, is the book by Colonel Harold G. Moore, We Were Soldiers Once and Young.

21:44.228 --> 21:48.673
Of course, the movie, We Were Soldiers, I think one of the finest...

21:49.092 --> 21:51.094
that Hollywood has put out about Vietnam.

21:52.075 --> 21:57.600
People who have seen that movie, seen that intense movie of that battle, of that fight.

21:58.181 --> 22:08.051
Lieutenant Payne, class of 65, was a reconnaissance platoon leader, Delta Company, 7th Cavalry, who defended the Albany perimeter and went on to serve two tours of Vietnam.

22:08.071 --> 22:16.399
I wanted to mention him because people who have seen that movie know the intense fight that was in We Were Soldiers under Colonel Harold Moore, and there was an Aggie in that battle.

22:16.649 --> 22:19.094
Right.

22:19.515 --> 22:24.124
That, of course, is a war that most of us remember now very vividly.

22:24.144 --> 22:37.071
And I remember while I was teaching, I was in the faculty here at Texas A&M, and a neighbor of mine who also is an Aggie spent three different tours of duty in Vietnam within that time period.

22:37.237 --> 22:40.623
Remember, Vietnam lasted a long time, almost 10 years.

22:41.084 --> 22:44.070
And in a way, it ain't over yet, I suppose.

22:44.090 --> 22:49.419
And that's the way it is in a lot of situations, unfortunately, as we know.

22:49.520 --> 22:53.567
And Korea, troops were in Korea through 1974, at least.

22:53.587 --> 22:59.498
I suspect we still have a presence of some sort in South Korea.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.600
Time is going by fast.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.143
We've only got about four minutes left.

23:02.183 --> 23:15.006
I wanted to mention from your book, Captain Robert L. Acklin, Jr., class of 63, who you say may have been the most decorated Aggie of all in Vietnam, maybe one of the most decorated Aggies of all.

23:14.986 --> 23:21.498
A helicopter pilot, infantry company commander, listen to this, awarded more than 60 decorations, 17 for valor in combat.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.905
Perhaps the most decorated Aggie of all time.

23:25.045 --> 23:34.783
Ackland was awarded the Silver Star, six bronze medals, four for valor, 40 air medals, four army commendation medals, the Purple Heart, and three Vietnamese crosses for gallantry.

23:35.793 --> 23:36.294
That's right.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.335
It's just amazing.

23:37.696 --> 23:49.834
And of course, you mentioned we're out of time, but we still have Operation Iraqi Freedom and so much still going on, maybe another day.

23:49.954 --> 23:50.115
Indeed.

23:50.695 --> 23:51.156
We have people.

23:51.176 --> 24:03.775
As a matter of fact, you list in your book, and I counted around 300 that you list here in your book, of Aggies who served in Operation Desert Shield and or Operation Desert Storm.

24:04.497 --> 24:08.320
Generally in the book, you wrap it up with a chapter called A Global Commitment.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.262
That's one of the final chapters.

24:10.762 --> 24:15.727
There's a quote by former Vice President Gerald Ford who was speaking at the A&M commencement.

24:15.847 --> 24:17.909
Also wanted to go to one of the pictures.

24:17.929 --> 24:19.670
This is from the class of 1988.

24:19.830 --> 24:21.872
This is Captain Daniel Hall.

24:21.892 --> 24:22.693
This is a photograph.

24:22.733 --> 24:27.917
He served in Iraq in the war that's going on right now in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

24:27.937 --> 24:30.279
And that's a photograph that's from your book right there.

24:30.399 --> 24:33.542
One of many Aggies who have...

24:33.910 --> 24:37.837
who have served both in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

24:37.857 --> 24:39.347
As a matter of fact, just this past fall,

24:39.698 --> 24:57.341
Mr. Dethloff, I don't know if you were at the Iowa State football game, but there was a salute to all of the current Aggie students who served in Afghanistan or in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and that former President Bush was there and gave some medals away and saluted those people.

24:57.361 --> 24:59.543
That was quite a moving halftime ceremony.

24:59.724 --> 25:04.710
Incidentally, the Aggie network has access to a lot of photographs from the front.

25:04.690 --> 25:11.244
in Iraq, and if people will access that, they can get a little bit of an eye view of what's going on and who's there.

25:11.464 --> 25:12.066
Right, right.

25:12.507 --> 25:17.638
You talk about civilian soldiers, chapter 19, the last chapter of your book, The Tradition of Service.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.007
What do you mean by civilian soldiers and how you wrap up this book?

25:21.987 --> 25:23.510
Well, it's the citizen soldier.

25:23.831 --> 25:34.291
And that's the American military has essentially been based on the citizen army, the citizen soldier and the commitment of service by civilians to their country.

25:34.311 --> 25:38.018
And that's been since the American Revolution, I think.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.421
And that still holds today.

25:39.741 --> 25:41.224
We really don't have a draft.

25:41.244 --> 25:42.747
We've had a draft implemented...

25:42.727 --> 26:11.434
intermittently but in a lot of cases I think those drafts helped stir people who were going to come in anyway to active duty but basically our military has depended upon volunteers. The volunteer I think makes the best soldier the best trained soldier the most committed soldier the most dedicated soldier and and I suppose I should conclude with the observation that Texas Aggies have been forefront among those volunteers for military service to their country

26:11.903 --> 26:23.145
Indeed, and as a matter of fact, in the final paragraph of your book, Bill Youngkin, who has been a guest on our show, who writes a weekly article in The Eagle about World War II veterans,

26:23.733 --> 26:27.420
You quote him in the very last paragraph of your book, and I'd like to read this.

26:27.460 --> 26:43.952
Bill Youngkin, former president of the Association of Former Students, class of 91, at the dedication of the Cora Plaza Memorial, when he said, when our country needs citizens to go forth and defend our country, our freedom, and our democratic way of life, you've always found Aggies in the forefront.

26:43.932 --> 26:52.190
We've been marching off to war, offering up our service and our lives, helping to carry our country's colors since our inception, and so it continues today.

26:52.531 --> 26:55.116
Bill Youngkin said that, and that's a good way to wrap it up.

26:55.136 --> 26:55.938
That's a good call.

26:55.998 --> 26:56.900
I think so.

26:57.120 --> 26:57.501
Thank you.

26:57.942 --> 26:58.684
Thank you for the book.

26:59.045 --> 26:59.606
Appreciate it.

26:59.626 --> 27:02.953
Thank you for your work, and thank you for the service.

27:02.933 --> 27:07.999
to the men and women who have committed such a wonderful service to our country.

27:08.119 --> 27:08.299
You bet.

27:08.439 --> 27:09.100
Thank you.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.041
Henry Dethloff.

27:10.061 --> 27:15.988
The history of Americans at war would not be complete without a chronicle of the service of Texas Aggies.

27:16.008 --> 27:19.892
And Henry Dethloff's book, Texas Aggies Go to War, does just that.

27:20.132 --> 27:25.218
You can order your copy of Texas Aggies Go to War on the Texas A&M University Press website.

27:25.278 --> 27:28.722
That's tamu.edu slash upress.

27:28.702 --> 27:32.868
Thanks to Henry Dethloff for coming back to talk more about Aggies in service.

27:33.209 --> 27:35.432
Thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:35.452 --> 27:42.482
And for more stories of the Brazos Valley veterans, check out Brazos Valley Heroes every Sunday in the Eagle.

27:42.502 --> 27:43.404
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:43.424 --> 27:45.647
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:45.647 --> 27:55.647
[Music.]

27:55.647 --> 28:08.647
