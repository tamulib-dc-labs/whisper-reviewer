00:30.000 --> 00:36.000

00:36.535 --> 00:38.519
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.640
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.071 --> 01:06.595
It was July the 30th, 1945, the USS Indianapolis, the flagship of the Fifth Fleet, had just four days earlier completed the most important and secretive mission of World War II, the delivery to Tinian Island of the most significant elements of the atomic bomb, which seven days later would destroy Hiroshima, forcing Japan surrender and ending the war.

01:06.615 --> 01:09.458
But just past midnight on that late July day,

01:09.927 --> 01:12.970
many lives changed and many more were lost.

01:12.990 --> 01:22.940
When a Japanese I-58 submarine under the order of Lieutenant Commander Michatsura Hashimoto fired six torpedoes from a range of 1,500 meters.

01:23.761 --> 01:30.587
In just 12 minutes, the Indianapolis was sunk with its crew of 1,157 sailors and 39 Marines.

01:31.208 --> 01:34.692
900 made it into the water before the ship went under.

01:34.712 --> 01:37.234
The rest drowned or perished in the explosion.

01:37.822 --> 01:44.692
For four days and five nights, they floated on rafts in the Pacific waters midway between Guam and the Leyte Gulf.

01:44.712 --> 01:51.522
By the time the rescue planes found them, nearly 600 of those 900 had died, some from exposure, most from shark attack.

01:52.022 --> 01:56.148
Just 317 were rescued, 92 of those survive today.

01:57.090 --> 02:06.563
Glenn D. Morgan of Camp Creek was one of the captain's telephone operators and one of the buglers aboard the USS Indianapolis, and we welcome him here today.

02:07.302 --> 02:10.685
Glenn Morgan, it is a pleasure to be with you and to see you.

02:10.785 --> 02:15.129
Let's take it back from July the 30th and talk about the mission itself.

02:15.169 --> 02:18.132
You all had this crate on board, the USS Indianapolis.

02:18.693 --> 02:22.036
It was a crate that obviously caused a lot of consternation.

02:22.056 --> 02:25.860
You didn't know exactly what it was, but you knew it had to do with your mission.

02:25.880 --> 02:36.870
Yes, they took us up to Hunter Point because we were scheduled to go on gunnery practice because of the damage that the suicide plane had done.

02:37.745 --> 02:45.716
But they short-circuited that and put this huge box in back, it's about the size of a van, standard van.

02:46.798 --> 02:47.879
We didn't know what it was.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.341
We knew it was very important.

02:50.103 --> 02:58.875
They loaded it, put it in the port hanger, and there it stayed until we delivered it to Tinian.

02:58.895 --> 03:04.263
But we had no idea what it was, of course, but we knew it was very important.

03:05.324 --> 03:07.347
They put marine guards on it.

03:08.238 --> 03:11.502
and allowed nobody to get close to it.

03:11.522 --> 03:16.769
I walked by it each day and we started a lot of rumors.

03:16.789 --> 03:19.993
It's one thing we like to do aboard ship was start rumors.

03:21.315 --> 03:30.226
So I started one that I thought it was the paperwork and all the maps that they were going to have to have for the invasion of Japan.

03:31.809 --> 03:36.034
That flew pretty good until somebody started the rumor that it was nothing but

03:36.470 --> 03:40.315
scented toilet paper for MacArthur.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.039
But yes, we knew it was important.

03:44.119 --> 03:54.272
Now, the uranium, they put forward in an area I had no idea where that was.

03:54.292 --> 03:55.934
But it was very, very important.

03:56.054 --> 03:57.616
So that's what we did.

03:57.656 --> 04:01.440
We headed out on a high speed run to Tinian.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.722
Right, right.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.743
So your mission was accomplished.

04:04.178 --> 04:08.643
And the delivery of what turned out to be the atomic bomb was made.

04:09.304 --> 04:13.509
But then July the 30th, about 10 minutes after midnight, the day had just started.

04:13.609 --> 04:19.957
Talk a little bit about where you were and what happened at that time.

04:19.977 --> 04:26.685
Well, I stood all my watches on the bridge, and during general quarters, I already manned these JL telephone circuits.

04:27.967 --> 04:30.490
We always had signals come up.

04:31.077 --> 04:35.141
conversations coming in from all over the ship and I was to report them to the captain.

04:35.902 --> 04:46.532
But on that night, I had served my time on watch and I had a housekeeping cleaning area and it was conning tower.

04:46.592 --> 04:55.400
And this was where they would take the bridge and you would go down below into conning tower and they could steer the ship and do everything they could do on the bridge.

04:56.582 --> 04:58.063
And this is where I was sleeping.

04:58.955 --> 05:14.407
and a friend of mine, and we slept on the deck on a mattress cover with a little life belt that you blew up with air, and we were using those for pillows when this terrific explosion occurred.

05:14.427 --> 05:18.475
Let's go ahead and, if we're ready, let's go ahead and take a look at the USS Indianapolis.

05:18.515 --> 05:19.798
We've got a photograph here.

05:20.116 --> 05:24.042
And we'll be able to tell you there's the Indianapolis right there.

05:24.422 --> 05:29.389
And from what I understand from what you've told me, you were situated somewhere right around there.

05:29.409 --> 05:29.570
Right.

05:29.650 --> 05:32.013
Right there at the front.

05:32.614 --> 05:32.754
Yep.

05:32.774 --> 05:34.537
Okay.

05:34.557 --> 05:36.560
But that's the Indianapolis.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.083
That's the cruiser, right?

05:39.103 --> 05:39.664
Right.

05:39.724 --> 05:42.608
It was a heavy cruiser, about 610 feet long.

05:43.550 --> 05:46.714
But it was an old cruiser, but Admiral Spruance.

05:47.369 --> 05:49.872
was always aboard generally.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.413
And it was very high speed.

05:51.474 --> 05:53.035
And that's one thing he liked about it.

05:53.075 --> 06:00.764
And that's what we were doing was about 33 knots across the, well to Pearl Harbor where we fueled up.

06:01.945 --> 06:07.571
The night that this happened, I say I was sleeping on the deck.

06:07.591 --> 06:09.433
My good friend there, we jumped up.

06:09.513 --> 06:13.798
I looked at my watch and it said that 10 minutes after midnight,

06:16.073 --> 06:19.477
So Ralph, my friend, said, why don't we go to the bridge, which we did.

06:20.598 --> 06:31.509
We climbed up a ladder and got on the bridge, and we decided this thing right then was not in very good shape because it was already listing to about 45 degrees.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.193
So we went aft to get a life jacket.

06:35.914 --> 06:39.597
All of our life jackets were strung on a wire behind the chart house.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.680
The chart house sat right in the middle of the bridge.

06:43.141 --> 06:43.622
None there.

06:44.002 --> 06:44.983
Already they were gone.

06:45.638 --> 06:52.947
So by the time we got to the forward part of the bridge, the deck was inclined to about 45 degrees.

06:54.309 --> 07:01.077
Only two other people were there, the bugler, the watch, and the officer of the deck, Lieutenant Orr.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.203
So I asked him, I said, is there anything we're supposed to do?

07:05.363 --> 07:05.883
What happened?

07:06.104 --> 07:07.045
He didn't know for sure.

07:07.185 --> 07:09.047
Thought we got torpedoed.

07:09.067 --> 07:14.274
But they'd already passed the word to abandon ship.

07:14.294 --> 07:15.055
So...

07:16.098 --> 07:25.933
My good friend and I decided to stick together, and I asked the bugler if he was going to sound abandoned ship, and he said, well, as soon as I get the order.

07:25.953 --> 07:27.335
He never got them.

07:27.355 --> 07:28.777
He never sounded abandoned ship.

07:29.398 --> 07:31.000
It wasn't necessary, really, of course.

07:32.342 --> 07:44.400
But I told Lieutenant Orr goodbye, told him I'd see him later, and crawled over the railing because that was the shortest way I knew to get to the water.

07:45.578 --> 07:47.380
My good friend did not follow me.

07:47.781 --> 07:50.665
He thought that was pretty stupid, I guess.

07:51.846 --> 07:57.113
But when I got down to the next deck, I slid down the side and jumped down to the next deck.

07:57.934 --> 08:06.245
Then I slid down the side of the ship until I got into the 40-millimeter gun mounts, and that's where the water swept me up against the gun.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.050
My little life belt sort of buoyed me up a little bit.

08:10.739 --> 08:19.212
The ship began to go down, and the gun barrels by this time were sitting straight up in the air, and I went right up one of those.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.175
Actually, I didn't go up, the gun went down.

08:21.857 --> 08:25.983
But there I was, free of the ship, and I swam away.

08:26.624 --> 08:30.871
And you swam hard, and you found a plane floating in the water.

08:30.891 --> 08:37.962
Looked around and watched the ship sink, and the screws were still turning, and the stern was high in the air.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.846
And then I thought, well, I better see what's happening here.

08:41.886 --> 08:44.169
And when I looked around, I could see way back.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.612
It was light enough that you could see a little bit.

08:48.253 --> 08:50.996
But I could see the silhouette of an airplane.

08:51.016 --> 08:52.638
And it was quite a ways back.

08:52.718 --> 09:00.066
So being the good swimmer that I was, I Australian crawled back to that Venice as fast as I could.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.210
The plane was sinking, but there was a life raft.

09:04.230 --> 09:05.752
And I crawled in that life raft.

09:06.273 --> 09:07.454
There was another life raft.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.455
I tied it together.

09:09.751 --> 09:16.300
And heads popped up and people crawled in the life raft and nobody knew anybody.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.502
You couldn't tell who it was.

09:17.562 --> 09:20.867
We swam through fuel oil and it was all over us.

09:22.469 --> 09:27.637
And finally everything got quiet and the calls for help subsided.

09:31.863 --> 09:36.349
We looked out and there was a little black blurb over there on the water and we

09:36.751 --> 09:40.375
hollered and they hollered back and we found that there were two more life rafts.

09:41.216 --> 09:43.198
They were lobbed on top of each other.

09:44.419 --> 09:55.991
And so consequently we got all four of those together and tied them together and there we had four life rafts strung out and tied together two or three feet apart.

09:57.793 --> 10:00.396
And I looked at my watch

10:01.017 --> 10:04.100
And I know that the thing was very loosey goosey.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.063
In fact, if you picked it up, it'd fall apart.

10:06.423 --> 10:08.505
So I know it stopped at 20 minutes after.

10:08.525 --> 10:14.732
So I was, 20 minutes, 10 minutes had elapsed since I looked at my watch and hit the water, apparently.

10:15.473 --> 10:19.017
So when the ship sank and they say 12 minutes, they were pretty close.

10:19.658 --> 10:20.219
Exactly.

10:20.239 --> 10:23.783
I want to give people an idea when you talk about the life raft, sort of what we're talking about.

10:23.823 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, right.

10:24.523 --> 10:29.549
Because in a recent reunion, you were able to actually see almost an exact replica of that life raft.

10:29.569 --> 10:30.450
And we have a photograph

10:30.768 --> 10:36.174
not the one you were in, but this is pretty much the kind of life raft that you're talking about.

10:36.194 --> 10:39.617
I guess it's made of wood mainly, right, what you were sitting on?

10:39.698 --> 10:41.459
Somebody told me it was balls of wood.

10:41.539 --> 10:42.961
I never really found out.

10:42.981 --> 10:50.489
But you can see that it's covered with a lacing of canvas and painted very heavily.

10:51.410 --> 10:58.918
And you sit down in the water, and that lattice work you're seeing is wood, and it's tied with little lines, little ropes.

10:59.371 --> 11:02.775
that allow you to sit in the water up to your navel just about.

11:03.856 --> 11:11.906
And of course ours had little wooden kegs of drinking water tied in it and there was some food and so forth.

11:12.286 --> 11:15.049
And I expect that's probably what's in those canisters on that.

11:15.069 --> 11:16.911
That's off of a little destroyer.

11:16.931 --> 11:18.073
Right, right.

11:18.093 --> 11:27.724
So you had found two of these and then you found another group and there were two more and you all strapped together in sort of a big rectangle.

11:28.261 --> 11:31.004
life rafts, and there were, what, 19 or 20 of you?

11:31.284 --> 11:46.161
We started with 20, and we had a Lieutenant Freeze that looked like he just had a severe sunburn, but unfortunately, we didn't realize it, but Lieutenant Freeze, he talked.

11:46.181 --> 11:52.328
He never said he was hurt or anything, but sometime during that first night, he passed away.

11:53.776 --> 12:10.321
And the fellas in his raft took his ring and his watch, and there wasn't anything he could do but just slip him over, and we all gave a little prayer to him, and that was the end of Mr. Freeze.

12:10.341 --> 12:17.472
I found it interesting, Glenn, that those who made it into the water who survived that

12:17.772 --> 12:22.177
you were spread out over a 50 square mile area, 10 miles by five miles.

12:22.237 --> 12:35.530
So with the swales and the way the Pacific Ocean was, its own character, for four days, you had no idea that you all on those four rafts, the 20 of you were not the only survivors of the Indianapolis.

12:35.591 --> 12:36.511
That's certainly true.

12:36.572 --> 12:42.658
The next morning, the waves were white capping and you looked around and there was not another soul.

12:43.018 --> 12:46.041
There was no debris, nothing.

12:46.061 --> 12:46.682
And...

12:48.265 --> 12:56.174
I started to go after a piece of, I thought it was pyrotechnics from the other raft, and somebody said, well, you better not look out there.

12:56.214 --> 12:58.697
And that was the first time I'd ever thought of sharks.

12:59.277 --> 13:05.304
And there was this classic picture, you see, of a shark fin going through the water.

13:05.324 --> 13:09.068
And I decided that was not prudent to go after that.

13:09.449 --> 13:10.550
It was just sailing away.

13:10.610 --> 13:13.513
It was blowing away like a sailboat, a canister.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.039
But I didn't go after it and apparently we didn't need it.

13:17.259 --> 13:22.851
So that was the end of my excursion after that thing with the shark out there.

13:25.216 --> 13:28.383
But actually, we made it pretty good.

13:28.463 --> 13:32.632
We were probably one of the best equipped group outside of the captain.

13:33.253 --> 13:35.097
He had four life rafts.

13:35.296 --> 13:40.703
But as the days went on and everybody got aggravated and we couldn't understand why we weren't rescued.

13:41.645 --> 13:45.530
And occasionally we would see an airplane way away.

13:47.212 --> 13:54.942
And finally we decided we better see if we thought we weren't going to get picked up.

13:54.962 --> 13:56.645
And I thought, well, I'll try fishing.

13:57.245 --> 13:59.008
So I tried this little fishing kit.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.371
The Navy did not.

14:01.638 --> 14:03.340
have a very good fishing kit.

14:03.881 --> 14:09.007
It was nothing but a white rag with some hooks stuck in it, some colored yarn, and a piece of bacon rye.

14:10.489 --> 14:11.711
Fish didn't like any of that.

14:13.253 --> 14:13.914
So I quit.

14:15.896 --> 14:22.725
But my good friend over in the other raft, I didn't know the fella, but I looked over and there he was.

14:23.066 --> 14:24.888
We'd rationed the water and everything.

14:25.008 --> 14:25.789
We had spams.

14:26.427 --> 14:28.931
Like three ounces of water a day, right?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.354
Yeah, we had three ounces of water.

14:30.374 --> 14:31.816
I think we had three ounces.

14:32.037 --> 14:37.827
There was some argument on this, but I remember, I think I remember better than anybody.

14:37.847 --> 14:41.093
But we had three ounces in the morning and three ounces in the afternoon.

14:41.754 --> 14:44.879
And we had little cups that had little ounce marks in them.

14:44.899 --> 14:46.883
So they set these up pretty good.

14:47.604 --> 14:49.988
But we didn't ration malt tablets.

14:50.845 --> 15:00.677
And so as I looked over this other raft, here was this guy laying down with his arm up on the edge of the raft, laying in the water, with a dip net in his hand, he'd just pull it apart.

15:01.678 --> 15:05.722
He would sit there like this, and he'd spit these malt tablets in the water.

15:07.444 --> 15:15.974
And in between the rafts, they would come and go, and it was a little calmer in between, and there was a little purple fish that would come up.

15:15.995 --> 15:20.700
And this guy would sit there with this little net, and just about the time that fish would grab that malt tablet,

15:22.132 --> 15:26.497
he would make a pass at it with this little dip net.

15:26.517 --> 15:34.787
And I watched this going on for a while, and finally I said, for crying out loud, I said, you're never going to catch that fish.

15:36.189 --> 15:38.011
And he said, well, what else have I got to do?

15:38.231 --> 15:39.393
And I thought, well, that made sense.

15:40.414 --> 15:43.017
And sure enough, he did catch that fish.

15:43.037 --> 15:49.725
So what turned out to be a good friend a little bit later, took his knife and cut that little purple fish up.

15:50.583 --> 15:57.472
And this guy used that for bait, and he caught the prettiest silver fish about this long, bluish silver.

15:57.492 --> 15:59.715
I don't know what kind they were.

15:59.735 --> 16:06.744
But he cleaned these things, this fella cleaned them with us and then filleted them and laid this nice white meat on the side of the raft.

16:06.804 --> 16:13.352
And most of us took a piece of it just to see, because we didn't really know how long we were gonna be out there.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.836
But now we knew that we could catch fish.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.919
Absolutely incredible.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.637
So you had the three ounces of water twice a day and you had the Spam.

16:22.657 --> 16:24.901
You learned to like Spam.

16:24.921 --> 16:25.963
I didn't mind the Spam.

16:26.003 --> 16:27.085
It was sort of salty.

16:27.105 --> 16:33.015
And later, after rescue, we all wrote a little blurb on what we thought about it.

16:33.035 --> 16:40.889
And that was one of the things that we didn't think they'd ought to be putting salty-tasting Spam in a life raft without too much water.

16:41.029 --> 16:41.329
That's right.

16:41.369 --> 16:42.291
Make you thirstier for it.

16:42.541 --> 16:53.373
The shark issue was, from what I understand, was more of an issue for a lot of the other groups that were around than maybe yours, but you did deal with sharks, especially one that you even named Charlie.

16:53.693 --> 16:54.194
Oh, we did.

16:54.234 --> 16:55.135
We had old Charlie.

16:55.215 --> 17:01.862
I didn't name him, but he was a big shark, and you can't believe how many sharks are in the Pacific Ocean out there in the middle.

17:02.463 --> 17:06.367
There's a lot of fish out there, and you can look down and see these things.

17:06.948 --> 17:10.472
You have to remember a lot of these fellas, and we didn't know this at the time,

17:11.212 --> 17:18.433
were out there all this time, five nights and four days in Kapok life jackets with no water.

17:18.453 --> 17:22.746
And these are the people the sharks really, really took.

17:22.766 --> 17:24.732
The shark we called Charlie,

17:25.420 --> 17:55.427
was a big shark and there were always sharks around us but this one seemed to be one whenever you got rid of your spam cans this shark liked that he took a liking to the grease or what was left in it and you could see that he would get kind of excited when we'd throw those spam cans in and one day I was sitting up on the edge of this raft the corner my little corner back here and not everybody can sit on the edge of the raft to get out of the water because it

17:55.863 --> 17:57.264
sinks further.

17:58.165 --> 18:10.457
It was my turn and I was sitting up on the corner of this thing and I was watching Charlie and old Charlie made a turn and started coming toward the raft and I watched him.

18:10.557 --> 18:22.989
I thought he'd turn but he came on in and by this time I thought it would be prudent if I slipped over away from him and you know Charlie came up out of the water.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.752
His head came up on the back corner of that raft

18:26.879 --> 18:32.107
and momentarily stopped, and then he slid back in.

18:32.127 --> 18:35.613
He didn't try to bite, he didn't try to tear anything up or anything.

18:36.734 --> 18:40.841
But that was my complete dealing with a shark.

18:40.861 --> 18:42.503
You were more fortunate than others.

18:42.523 --> 18:43.605
Oh, much more fortunate.

18:43.625 --> 18:53.781
Yes, especially, and being in the rafts, obviously, because the people that were just in the jackets, they were the favorite target of the sharks, obviously.

18:53.947 --> 19:04.760
Some of the guys would jump over the side in the hot part of the day and get cooled off, and none of the sharks appeared to care to try to attack them or anything.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.044
But I'm sure they'd crawl back in when the one got close.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.366
But I never did.

19:09.466 --> 19:12.810
I thought it'd be better to save my energy and just sit there.

19:13.491 --> 19:19.638
The explosion happened on a Sunday, and you go through Monday, you go through Tuesday, Wednesday.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.363
Faith was waning at this point, I think, and then

19:24.322 --> 19:29.648
And then all of a sudden, someone found you, and it was quite by accident, as the story was told later.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.310
That's really true.

19:31.611 --> 19:42.644
My friend in this other raft, the sun was setting in the evening of the fourth day there, and he said, Morgan, he said, look down south.

19:42.704 --> 19:45.568
Now, we knew where south was if the sun was setting in the west.

19:46.168 --> 19:51.595
There was a little speck on the, and he said, is that a bird or a plane?

19:52.688 --> 19:54.690
And I said, gosh, I believe that's a bird.

19:55.191 --> 20:00.417
And about that time, a little flash of light came off of this speck.

20:00.437 --> 20:02.119
And I said, no, I believe that's a plane.

20:02.159 --> 20:07.265
And when I said plane, all this time, these other guys, everybody was pretty dejected.

20:07.285 --> 20:11.050
And you just sat there and you didn't say much, long periods of time.

20:12.711 --> 20:22.543
And the only humorous part about this was one of the fellows in one of the other rafts said one day, he said, why don't we just break out the paddles and start

20:23.047 --> 20:27.995
paddling instead of just dying out here doing nothing.

20:28.015 --> 20:30.078
And I said, well, where would you want to paddle to?

20:30.118 --> 20:31.280
Which direction would you go?

20:31.300 --> 20:32.522
And he said, well, I don't know.

20:32.662 --> 20:35.767
He said, how far do you think land is?

20:36.909 --> 20:40.014
And I said, well, I said, I believe land's about a mile and a half.

20:40.234 --> 20:41.096
And he said, which way?

20:41.356 --> 20:44.100
And of course, I pointed straight down.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.244
And he didn't think that was funny.

20:46.264 --> 20:48.868
And I thought it was kind of humorous at the time.

20:49.388 --> 20:51.790
Later I found out I was wrong on the depth.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.413
It turned out to be more like four miles deep.

20:56.195 --> 21:00.139
But as far as the spec was concerned on the horizon, it did turn out to be an airplane.

21:00.199 --> 21:06.805
And that night, why, we found that they were searching for us.

21:06.825 --> 21:17.036
And Graham Claytor, one of the commanders of the destroyer escort, Doyle, shined blue searchlights up in the air.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.417
Now, they weren't supposed to do that.

21:19.325 --> 21:26.912
But he told one of his officers, he said, well, why not just shine them on the water?

21:26.932 --> 21:31.477
We can't search for these people in the water and run over them with a ship.

21:31.497 --> 21:40.886
So they turned on the searchlights and at the same time, they turned the searchlights up in the air and we could see those searchlights those many miles away.

21:40.906 --> 21:45.710
And we were so elated because we knew then that we were going to be rescued.

21:46.611 --> 21:47.712
And sure enough,

21:49.143 --> 21:56.012
Well, several airplanes came over and visited us just by simply throwing a marker in the water and waving.

21:57.254 --> 22:01.440
That made us sort of glow warm at the sight of those things.

22:02.521 --> 22:15.960
But it took a while, and it wasn't until about noon that fifth day that we saw an antenna coming over the horizon, and the USS APD ringless stopped and picked us up.

22:16.008 --> 22:21.976
And that was one of, I guess, about five ships that actually participated in the rescue.

22:22.116 --> 22:23.798
Yeah.

22:23.819 --> 22:26.462
The Cecil J. Doyle, I know, was one of the ones, I believe.

22:28.184 --> 22:29.967
But the ringness was the one that picked you up.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.889
Ringness, APD ringness.

22:31.909 --> 22:39.079
And it was then that you found out that it wasn't just 20 of you, but indeed it was 317 of you that had been scattered over this area.

22:39.447 --> 22:53.972
As we got aboard, I heard one of my good friends, Vincent Allard, shouted my name clear down the passageway, and they were taking our clothes off because we were greasy with fuel oil.

22:53.992 --> 23:00.443
And I didn't mention it, but the first day, I'd swallowed this, and so did the other fellas that all swallowed this black fuel oil.

23:01.317 --> 23:06.664
This stuff is probably the molecular structure of just about crude oil.

23:08.386 --> 23:17.878
And it tastes like crude oil, looked like it ought to taste, because it was, really, I didn't really know I'd swallowed it.

23:18.478 --> 23:20.381
But that first morning, I was so sick.

23:20.401 --> 23:22.383
We were sick, all of us, all day.

23:23.585 --> 23:29.552
And we upchucked that fuel oil until some green stuff came up.

23:30.038 --> 23:32.741
And after that came up, I began to feel much better.

23:32.761 --> 23:34.684
In fact, you almost felt, you felt so good.

23:34.724 --> 23:37.727
You felt like maybe you was on a hive of some kind.

23:37.747 --> 23:41.352
But no, the captain was picked up by the ringers ahead of us.

23:42.693 --> 23:47.980
And of course, I knew the captain, not personally, but we stood a lot of time together on the bridge.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.643
And he called for me.

23:50.663 --> 23:55.088
I went around and got all the, and that's the fact, that's the last time I met the captain.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.670
I saw the captain in person.

23:57.747 --> 24:02.114
until our reunion started in 1960, and he came to the first reunion.

24:02.314 --> 24:02.634
Indeed.

24:02.654 --> 24:14.092
The story of Captain McVeigh is a whole other story that we're not going to have time to tell, but it's chronicled in a couple of books, actually four or five books, Abandoned Ship and All the Drowned Sailors are the two that I have read.

24:15.113 --> 24:19.139
You're on the ship, and I want to go to this picture right now.

24:19.199 --> 24:23.586
This is a photo of you and some of your fellow survivors.

24:23.937 --> 24:25.058
describe that picture.

24:25.098 --> 24:26.920
This is you in the foreground.

24:26.940 --> 24:28.061
That's the young Lynn Morgan.

24:28.402 --> 24:29.403
Yeah, that was me.

24:29.563 --> 24:33.727
And the fellow next to me was the first class.

24:33.747 --> 24:36.470
He was the ranking personnel aboard this.

24:36.510 --> 24:38.011
He was a first class radio man.

24:39.313 --> 24:41.555
He's the one that sent the message.

24:41.615 --> 24:46.500
And I said, well, I know you tap out a little signal, but how did you know that signal left the antenna?

24:46.520 --> 24:53.387
And he said, well, Morgan, he said, I'm smart enough to know when the signal's going because I've got a meter that tells me so.

24:54.110 --> 24:56.253
And that sold me on the idea.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.935
So the next guy.

24:57.955 --> 24:58.837
And this is Admiral Spruance.

24:58.857 --> 24:59.337
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:59.357 --> 24:59.698
Go ahead.

24:59.718 --> 25:00.499
The next fellow.

25:00.579 --> 25:05.126
Yeah, that's Admiral Spruance pinning Purple Heart on each one of us.

25:05.166 --> 25:08.010
He hadn't gotten to me yet, but he finally made it.

25:08.070 --> 25:17.023
The guy before him is one of the members that was in my actual life raft.

25:17.043 --> 25:22.691
So this is obviously, this photograph actually is in the book All the Drowned Sailors, as a matter of fact.

25:22.791 --> 25:22.951
Yes.

25:23.091 --> 25:23.712
There you go.

25:24.670 --> 25:33.362
Um, we're going to go to another picture in a moment, but, uh, talk a little bit about what were your injuries?

25:33.382 --> 25:35.264
What, what was the results?

25:35.344 --> 25:37.267
I came off, uh, unscathed.

25:37.367 --> 25:40.631
I damaged my leg jumping from this skin a little bit.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.778
Uh, it was sort of embarrassing.

25:45.798 --> 25:50.965
A lot of the damage came from, you know, I said we had these wooden kegs and we didn't,

25:51.350 --> 25:56.876
after we finished the water in these kegs, they would float inside the rack, they weren't pinned down.

25:56.896 --> 26:11.851
And they would, the waves would work those things up and they'd bounce against your shins, believe it or not, and it would bruise your shins and then the salt water would eat a, I thought I had gangrene setting in it, they turned green.

26:12.932 --> 26:16.416
Actually there was nothing serious about them really.

26:16.436 --> 26:17.897
So I came out of this thing

26:18.502 --> 26:23.990
with only those wounds outside of being sick and not being able to see.

26:24.570 --> 26:27.955
That's another thing you couldn't see with this fuel oil in it.

26:27.995 --> 26:34.804
In fact it took a couple of days before and when you would try to, I'd try to stand up to see over these other waves, see if I could see.

26:35.946 --> 26:36.727
You can't do it.

26:37.268 --> 26:41.033
Standing up was futile and opening your eyes

26:41.468 --> 26:45.732
and the bright sun and everything just killed you.

26:45.752 --> 26:56.843
And you'd sit there and spit in your fingers and wipe your eyes and it didn't seem to help but about on the second day, everything began to get a lot better.

26:57.664 --> 27:00.707
And I tell you, I felt a lot better from then on.

27:00.727 --> 27:02.549
But it never seemed to bother my eyes.

27:02.669 --> 27:03.690
I see fairly well.

27:04.331 --> 27:10.497
Glenn, this summer you'll be remembering the 60th anniversary of this.

27:10.763 --> 27:14.006
You all have had reunions just about every summer in Indianapolis.

27:14.046 --> 27:17.810
Matter of fact, we've got a photograph here of one of your very, very early reunions.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.614
This is aboard the USS Hollandia.

27:22.435 --> 27:24.397
And you can barely remember that.

27:24.417 --> 27:26.659
I think that was taken in the 1960s, I believe.

27:26.960 --> 27:32.645
No, this was actually, Tom, this was actually taken on the way back.

27:32.746 --> 27:39.032
This was the survivors that the Hollandia picked us up on Guam and all those that were able.

27:40.193 --> 27:42.116
There were still some pretty sick fellows.

27:42.136 --> 27:42.377
Right.

27:42.757 --> 27:46.203
But those that were able, they loaded us aboard this aircraft carrier.

27:47.024 --> 27:49.788
And I think you have a picture of that later.

27:49.808 --> 27:53.595
But yeah, we were all ganged up out there and they took this picture.

27:53.655 --> 27:55.057
I didn't remember when they took it.

27:55.518 --> 27:58.703
I never could find myself in that picture, but I'm there.

27:58.783 --> 28:01.007
You are definitely there.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.793
This is a story that would take days and days and days to tell.

28:04.873 --> 28:07.517
Unfortunately, we have a half an hour to tell it, but I do.

28:07.767 --> 28:13.032
refer people to the books, All the Drowned Sailors, Abandoned Ship.

28:13.052 --> 28:14.574
There's two or three other books also.

28:15.495 --> 28:18.878
An incredible story that you continue to tell.

28:18.918 --> 28:27.967
You tell the young groups, you tell the older groups, and it's one that we're very proud to have you here, certainly, Glenn Morgan, and we thank you very much for visiting with us and telling us your story.

28:28.407 --> 28:28.728
Appreciate it.

28:28.748 --> 28:29.608
An incredible story.

28:30.129 --> 28:36.255
Glenn Morgan and 91 others, survivors, survived the largest naval wartime disaster in history.

28:36.556 --> 28:39.601
It has been chronicled in the four books that I have talked to you about.

28:39.661 --> 28:48.254
The script for the movie Jaws, you remember Robert Shaw telling Richard Dreyfuss about the scar that he got from the shark bites after serving on the Indianapolis.

28:48.655 --> 28:49.556
Well, that was Hollywood.

28:49.717 --> 28:50.338
This is real.

28:50.558 --> 28:53.903
Glenn D. Morgan is real and proudly tells his story.

28:53.923 --> 28:56.788
We salute him and be sure to thank a veteran.

28:56.808 --> 28:59.352
For Glenn D. Morgan, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:59.712 --> 29:01.956
Tune in next time on Veterans of the Valley.

29:02.000 --> 29:15.000
[Silence.]

29:15.000 --> 29:25.000
[Music.]

29:25.000 --> 29:40.000
[Music.]
