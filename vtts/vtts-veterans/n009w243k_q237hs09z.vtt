00:16.417 --> 00:35.828
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.088 --> 00:37.210
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.628 --> 00:46.443
As much as she wanted to and even volunteered to, Hazel Von Roeder's tours of duty during World War II in Korea never sent her overseas.

00:46.463 --> 00:53.275
But as any veteran will tell you, stateside service was just as essential to the war effort as any other service.

00:53.255 --> 01:08.198
Hazel Skills as an Army nurse took her to Fort Bliss's famed William Beaumont Army Hospital during World War II and then to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio as an Air Force flight nurse with the 1734th match during the Korean conflict.

01:08.699 --> 01:12.044
Her story of service is indeed one of courage and dedication.

01:12.064 --> 01:12.765
Please welcome

01:13.015 --> 01:16.459
Air Force Captain Hazel Von Roeder to Veterans of the Valley.

01:16.839 --> 01:18.040
Hazel, it's a pleasure to know you.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.262
It's a pleasure to have you here.

01:19.722 --> 01:22.305
You were born and raised in Welburn, Texas.

01:22.325 --> 01:24.307
What was Welburn, Texas like back in the 1920s?

01:24.347 --> 01:25.909
That's right.

01:26.069 --> 01:27.050
Oh, what was it like?

01:27.070 --> 01:27.691
What was it like?

01:28.031 --> 01:30.694
Well, at that time, I thought it was a pretty nice place.

01:31.315 --> 01:31.835
Pretty small.

01:32.536 --> 01:39.804
Well, it has been smaller, but now it's not even the same place anymore.

01:39.984 --> 01:40.845
Right.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.493
I hardly know anyone in there anymore.

01:44.093 --> 01:51.002
But when I was there, there was grocery stores, a barber shop, a saloon.

01:51.262 --> 01:51.562
Right.

01:52.243 --> 01:54.326
Just, you name it, and I was almost there.

01:54.986 --> 01:57.269
Your dad and your granddad owned a general merchandise store.

01:57.289 --> 02:03.577
Yes, my dad, my grandfather and dad had a general merchandise that was known as John H. Reuter & Son.

02:03.597 --> 02:03.897
Uh-huh.

02:04.552 --> 02:09.120
And your mom was home raising four boys and two girls, right?

02:09.140 --> 02:10.022
That's right.

02:10.042 --> 02:10.262
Right.

02:10.623 --> 02:12.647
You always wanted to be a nurse, you told me.

02:12.667 --> 02:19.439
You said you had a passion for this really from when you were a little girl and one of your little brothers was even one of your patients, right?

02:19.459 --> 02:20.141
Yes, he was.

02:20.421 --> 02:24.068
I said I stunned his growth because he's always so small.

02:24.088 --> 02:25.851
I would make a concoction of

02:26.270 --> 02:27.913
Jawbreakers, you know what they are.

02:27.933 --> 02:28.634
Yes, ma'am.

02:28.654 --> 02:30.937
Water, salt and pepper till they dissolve.

02:31.138 --> 02:31.418
Right.

02:31.438 --> 02:33.742
And I say, Norman, it's time to take your medicine.

02:33.822 --> 02:34.523
He would take it.

02:35.464 --> 02:37.728
He'd do whatever Sister Hazel would tell you.

02:37.768 --> 02:38.068
That's right.

02:38.129 --> 02:39.991
Whatever I told him to do, he did.

02:40.813 --> 02:41.774
And survived it, right?

02:42.375 --> 02:42.475
Yeah.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.196
Right.

02:43.858 --> 02:46.101
Graduated from, you went to school in a one-

02:46.486 --> 02:56.698
one-room schoolhouse in Wellborn for four years, and then you came to College Station where A&M Consolidated High School was actually located on campus, on the A&M campus, right?

02:56.718 --> 02:57.720
Yes, correct.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.181
Right, right.

02:59.362 --> 03:01.284
You wanted to be a nurse, so you did, 1941.

03:01.364 --> 03:04.568
Talk about Jeff Davis Hospital in Houston.

03:04.608 --> 03:08.713
You went there in September of 1941, and it's no longer there, but you learned a lot there, didn't you?

03:08.812 --> 03:11.080
Oh, you better believe I did.

03:11.221 --> 03:16.380
It was a city county hospital, and you just saw a little bit of everything.

03:16.480 --> 03:16.982
Yes, ma'am.

03:17.823 --> 03:24.773
Jeff Davis had only been in existence a very short time when I went there, so it was really a new hospital.

03:24.993 --> 03:25.253
Right.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.037
But it was well known for the care that they got.

03:28.378 --> 03:28.658
Right.

03:29.078 --> 03:33.605
It was not far from Fifth Ward, which was not a very nice place in Houston.

03:33.625 --> 03:34.105
Yes, ma'am.

03:34.346 --> 03:34.826
Yes, ma'am.

03:35.367 --> 03:43.598
Three months after you entered there for nursing training, December 7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked.

03:43.618 --> 03:45.501
The United States was in World War II.

03:45.953 --> 03:49.357
And you told me that you knew then that you wanted to be in the military.

03:49.757 --> 03:58.247
Yes, I was on duty at the time, and they called us to the nurses' quarters, which was right behind the hospital.

03:58.267 --> 04:10.982
And they told us that war had been declared, and I thought, well, I have some brothers, and the boys that I grew up or went to school with would all be going to the military.

04:11.002 --> 04:13.345
So I made up my mind that's what I wanted to do.

04:13.949 --> 04:22.187
And my senior year at Jeff Davis, they had what they called the Cadet Corps, which I think you got a few dollars from the government and

04:22.775 --> 04:26.659
then you were obligated to go into the service after you graduated.

04:26.859 --> 04:27.139
Right.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.861
You were a cadet nurse, is that?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.142
Yes, my senior year.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.365
And that was your senior year.

04:32.385 --> 04:36.088
So after you finished nursing school, you were in the Army.

04:36.168 --> 04:41.914
You went to Fort Sam Houston, as a lot of soldiers did for your basic, right?

04:41.934 --> 04:43.135
Yes.

04:43.155 --> 04:44.217
Right, right.

04:44.237 --> 04:47.800
And then off to El Paso, to Fort Bliss.

04:47.860 --> 04:48.681
That must have been...

04:49.302 --> 04:50.744
A long way away from home.

04:50.784 --> 04:52.788
You must have wondered, where am I, right?

04:52.808 --> 04:53.068
Well, it was.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.033
I had only been away from home to go to Jeff Davis in Houston.

04:56.213 --> 04:56.494
Right.

04:57.075 --> 05:07.351
And when I got on the train to go to El Paso, and we rode for I don't know how long I thought, this is the end of the jumping off place.

05:09.775 --> 05:12.479
It was hot in the daytime, but it was always cool at night.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.521
Right.

05:13.653 --> 05:15.155
What year would this have been, about 1943, 44?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.718
No, no.

05:17.218 --> 05:18.460
See, I didn't graduate to 44.

05:18.540 --> 05:19.622
It was in 45.

05:19.682 --> 05:20.643
It was in 1945.

05:20.763 --> 05:21.304
Okay.

05:22.005 --> 05:25.931
So it was towards the end of the war in Europe and the end of the war in Japan.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.575
Yes, in fact, I hadn't been in service too long when the war was over.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.496
When the war was over.

05:29.677 --> 05:30.177
That's right.

05:30.758 --> 05:38.850
You talked about one of the rules of all nurses was to not get involved and don't fall in love with a patient, and you broke that rule.

05:39.218 --> 05:41.683
Well, along with several others.

05:43.046 --> 05:48.678
But you had to get permission from your chief nurse before you could get married.

05:48.698 --> 05:50.522
And I will remember what she said to me.

05:51.204 --> 05:51.845
Hop to it.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.130
Do it.

05:55.292 --> 05:55.673
Yeah.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.497
Hubert Forney, you married.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.957
Hubert had been a paratrooper in Europe, is that right?

06:01.077 --> 06:02.219
A young man from Perry, Oklahoma.

06:02.239 --> 06:02.880
That's correct.

06:03.601 --> 06:09.749
And he had been a paratrooper in Europe, and he had to come to Fort Bliss, I guess, because to cure wounds, I guess.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.472
Well, he wasn't wounded.

06:11.532 --> 06:19.603
He had some health problems, so he was there and thought, perhaps, he would be going.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.160
Right.

06:20.601 --> 06:21.062
To Japan.

06:21.242 --> 06:23.585
To Japan, which the war was over.

06:23.645 --> 06:27.371
So instead of going to Japan, he went back to Perry.

06:27.791 --> 06:28.412
Right.

06:28.432 --> 06:29.894
You all married and you lived in Perry.

06:29.914 --> 06:32.919
Your in-laws had a dairy farm and a restaurant there.

06:32.939 --> 06:33.600
Is that right?

06:33.620 --> 06:35.002
Yes, that's correct.

06:35.102 --> 06:36.063
Known as Farney Dairy.

06:36.524 --> 06:37.425
Right.

06:37.445 --> 06:42.492
Sadly, you were married three years and Hubert died of a bulbar polio.

06:42.512 --> 06:42.833
Yes.

06:42.853 --> 06:46.558
Which a lot of people don't know about now, but back then it was quite prevalent.

06:47.359 --> 06:48.040
It certainly was.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.422
It was nationwide.

06:49.452 --> 06:54.399
You stayed in the reserves.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.140
Yes.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.222
Talk about what you did after that.

06:56.242 --> 06:57.804
You went to Baytown for a while, right?

06:58.425 --> 07:02.310
When I got out of the Army, you were not discharged from the service.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.972
You were separated from the service.

07:04.954 --> 07:05.655
Right.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.876
So I stayed in the reserves.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.218
You stayed in the reserves.

07:08.238 --> 07:15.088
I want to talk about Fort Bliss some more because I don't want to leave that because I've learned a lot about the hospital there, the William Beaumont Hospital.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.252
which is now known as the William Beaumont Army Medical Center.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.937
And you were actually working in part of the annex of that, right?

07:21.957 --> 07:22.197
Yes.

07:22.217 --> 07:23.038
In Fort Bliss.

07:23.058 --> 07:23.859
At Fort Bliss.

07:23.879 --> 07:24.159
Right.

07:24.740 --> 07:36.555
This was a hospital that, according to my own research at the time of World War II, around that time, it had about 70 buildings or so.

07:36.675 --> 07:40.620
It was pretty a spread out area, but it was quite a facility, right?

07:40.840 --> 07:41.461
Yes, it was.

07:41.681 --> 07:41.961
Yeah.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.303
Talk about...

07:43.840 --> 07:55.693
what you did there, because this is a big part of your story and the people that you cared for and the nurses that you cared for that had been in Japan, and especially the ones that had come from Corregidor.

07:57.275 --> 08:08.247
Well, we got, you know, general nursing care, changed dressings, administered medications, and gave a lending ear to the ones that wanted to talk to you about what had happened to them.

08:08.487 --> 08:08.828
Right.

08:08.848 --> 08:10.129
And a lot of them did that.

08:10.329 --> 08:11.991
Right, right, right.

08:12.427 --> 08:19.959
I know that the Beaumont Hospital was especially known for its plastic surgery at the time, so this was a very important part of it.

08:21.261 --> 08:27.651
I well remember at Fort Bliss, I had a patient with the name of Samuel Carpenter.

08:28.112 --> 08:28.954
Yes, ma'am.

08:28.974 --> 08:33.220
He was really a tough cookie, if you want to call him that.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.322
He was from the Bronx.

08:34.703 --> 08:34.823
Right.

08:35.309 --> 08:41.238
And they were on bedwack and he had a little too much to drink and he got run over by a truck.

08:41.278 --> 08:43.341
So he was paralyzed from his waist down.

08:44.723 --> 08:47.607
He was determined he was going to walk.

08:47.627 --> 08:53.456
And there was a little, the nurse attendants we had were whacks.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.639
And he called this one peewee.

08:55.659 --> 09:04.472
She was a little bitty one, but she'd get him up and he'd try to walk and he'd fall flat on the floor and he'd use a lot of profanity and then he'd get up and he'd try again.

09:06.595 --> 09:09.901
You go off duty and you think, well, he was not going to be here in the morning.

09:10.602 --> 09:10.862
Right.

09:11.223 --> 09:14.589
But you go back and he was just what you call bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

09:14.789 --> 09:15.070
Right.

09:15.991 --> 09:18.516
And we had a ward officer, Dr. Zucker.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.762
He said, Carpenter's not going to die.

09:22.843 --> 09:26.931
He said, the Lord don't want him and the devil's not ready for him.

09:26.951 --> 09:27.351
Wonderful.

09:27.371 --> 09:31.759
Do you know that a week before I was discharged,

09:32.279 --> 09:35.202
He got a pass to go to Juarez, Mexico.

09:35.402 --> 09:36.884
He walked with a cane.

09:36.904 --> 09:37.164
Right.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.027
He wanted me to go with him, and I said, no way.

09:43.090 --> 09:43.671
Good choice.

09:43.731 --> 09:44.471
He came back.

09:44.531 --> 09:46.073
You could tell he'd had a good time.

09:48.195 --> 10:01.349
The nurses that you cared for at Fort Bliss, there's a lot of people that don't know the history of this, but there were nearly 70 nurses that were taken prisoner as a result of the fall of Bataan to the Japanese.

10:01.649 --> 10:01.729
Yes.

10:02.148 --> 10:11.888
And while these nurses were not specifically part of what's known as the Bataan Death March, they were still evacuated to Curricadores.

10:12.442 --> 10:15.947
and I believe later served in internment camps in Manila.

10:16.007 --> 10:16.387
They did.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.230
And before they came.

10:18.270 --> 10:25.559
But a lot of these nurses were treated rather barbarically and harshly, and these were the ones that you cared for.

10:25.639 --> 10:28.503
You saw a lot of suffering from these ladies.

10:28.603 --> 10:29.184
Oh, yes, yes.

10:30.325 --> 10:36.053
They were what you call basket cases, mentally disturbed.

10:36.293 --> 10:36.594
Right.

10:39.237 --> 10:41.520
They were on starvation diets.

10:42.412 --> 10:45.676
I don't know how, really, I don't know how they survived.

10:45.696 --> 10:48.038
I don't know how any of those prisoners survived.

10:48.159 --> 10:49.220
Right, right.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.043
And they were ill because they were dealing with not only malaria.

10:52.063 --> 10:52.483
That's right.

10:52.644 --> 10:59.972
And if they had illness, if they were on a medication and they ran out of it, there was no replacement for it.

10:59.992 --> 11:05.939
They didn't have, drugs were not replaced or medications were not replaced.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.120
Right, right.

11:07.353 --> 11:10.220
You always wanted to go overseas, and we mentioned that from the outset.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.964
You were ready to go overseas.

11:12.004 --> 11:16.756
You wanted to go where the action was, and you volunteered, but your name never came up.

11:16.876 --> 11:17.418
That's right.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.202
Why do you think that?

11:19.486 --> 11:21.088
I guess it was meant to be.

11:21.168 --> 11:21.989
I wasn't to go.

11:22.450 --> 11:23.070
I don't know.

11:23.551 --> 11:23.731
Right.

11:23.871 --> 11:27.556
Seems like they had their quota every time before your name.

11:27.656 --> 11:28.557
That's right.

11:28.577 --> 11:39.170
And a lot of my classmates that I had at Jeff Davis were in the service, and one of my roommates was in France, Lahore, France.

11:40.371 --> 11:46.118
And I just, I would like to have gone, but I never had the opportunity.

11:46.199 --> 11:50.204
Well, the service that you provided stateside was, like we said, certainly essential.

11:50.845 --> 12:03.681
You'd made the thought to me, you told me that at Jeff Davis, when you were there, that you thought you were prepared to go into the military and seen everything you could see, but you were wrong?

12:04.121 --> 12:05.102
I was wrong.

12:05.122 --> 12:08.967
Yeah, because of what you ended up seeing and experiencing.

12:09.217 --> 12:19.914
You know what was so ironic about the patients during World War, or the servicemen during World War II, that they always said, take care of my buddy first.

12:20.194 --> 12:20.575
Yes, ma'am.

12:21.736 --> 12:23.459
That was not so during the Korean.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.801
Right.

12:24.821 --> 12:25.302
Yeah.

12:25.687 --> 12:29.811
There was a difference in the soldier of World War II and the soldier of Korea.

12:30.031 --> 12:31.312
Take care of my buddy first.

12:31.493 --> 12:32.734
Right, right.

12:35.897 --> 12:37.739
Let's go and jump forward.

12:39.060 --> 12:46.707
You changed services from the Army to what had then become the Air Force, no longer the Army Air Corps, but had become the Air Force.

12:47.328 --> 12:52.453
Talk about your decision to do that because you always wanted to be involved in flight and a flight nurse, right?

12:52.653 --> 13:01.062
Well, see, when I first went to Fort Sam, I thought that I was going to get to be a flight nurse then with Air Corps.

13:01.283 --> 13:01.663
Right.

13:01.683 --> 13:02.644
But I was wrong.

13:02.664 --> 13:02.884
Right.

13:04.266 --> 13:10.773
And I just thought, well, if I ever go back in, I want to be a flight nurse.

13:12.695 --> 13:13.816
So I did.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.040
Right.

13:17.780 --> 13:22.908
I want to talk about your service at Kelly Air Force Base at a flight nurse.

13:22.948 --> 13:26.313
Talk a little bit about the unit you were with.

13:26.433 --> 13:32.703
Again, that was the 1734th MATS, which stands for Military Air Transport Service.

13:32.723 --> 13:33.324
That's correct.

13:33.764 --> 13:38.932
So tell us what you did and what your service, you did a lot of flying.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.976
Well, we could fly on 18 months.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.863
We had a flight that went from

13:46.450 --> 13:53.862
San Antonio up the east coast, and our destination was Westover, Massachusetts.

13:55.024 --> 14:08.326
And then we had one that went to the west coast, it was over to California, and then up to, I guess it was Washington, they went over to Belleville, Illinois, and then came back.

14:10.108 --> 14:12.913
So we would be gone two or three days on a flight,

14:13.670 --> 14:18.779
and maybe be back home at base for a couple of days and then go out again.

14:18.799 --> 14:19.440
And what would you do?

14:20.081 --> 14:25.350
Where did the flights land, who did they pick up, and then what was your job once they did?

14:25.671 --> 14:35.408
Well, of course, they always had their medical records with them, and I had to check that to see what kind of medications they were on, what they needed while they were in flight.

14:36.248 --> 14:43.721
Now, these were Korean War soldiers, Korean War people that had been casualties, that had been wounded.

14:43.902 --> 14:44.523
That's right.

14:44.543 --> 14:50.093
And they were either on their way home or either they were going to a hospital closer home.

14:50.353 --> 14:52.156
Right, right, right.

14:53.138 --> 14:55.843
What were these...

14:56.802 --> 14:57.964
these airplanes like?

14:57.984 --> 15:04.416
I think we determined C-54s or some sort of carrier units, type of converted conveyor type airplanes.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.359
We're going to see a picture of one here in a moment.

15:06.379 --> 15:11.188
Well, they had rows of litters or stretchers or litters as we called them.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.893
Two or three high.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.296
Right.

15:15.316 --> 15:18.321
And those potions would be in there.

15:18.858 --> 15:22.987
The ones that had to like more have bed rest were in the stretchers.

15:23.529 --> 15:28.821
And then we had the ones that were ambulatory that they, you know, they sat in a regular seat.

15:28.841 --> 15:29.622
In regular seats.

15:29.703 --> 15:29.923
Yeah.

15:29.943 --> 15:30.504
That's right.

15:30.524 --> 15:35.456
And it was your job to keep them comfortable to keep, I guess, there were IVs involved.

15:35.496 --> 15:37.440
There were just all different kinds of.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.465
I don't recall giving any IVs while I was there.

15:40.745 --> 15:47.456
I gave injections and oral medication, changed dressings and things like that.

15:47.577 --> 15:48.178
Right, right.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.363
While they were being transported.

15:51.383 --> 15:51.603
Yes.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.666
Did that get difficult after a while?

15:53.687 --> 15:56.651
I mean, because when you're flying around, there's turbulence.

15:56.711 --> 15:58.314
The planes are going back and forth.

15:58.354 --> 16:00.137
Oh, well, one time I landed up in the...

16:00.725 --> 16:01.927
Garbage pail.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.594
It was a big garbage barrel, I guess you'd say.

16:06.754 --> 16:07.716
Right.

16:07.736 --> 16:18.433
And I got up to go back in the tail of the plane to get a cup of coffee, and we hit an air pocket, and next thing I knew, I was like a jackknife sitting down in this barrel.

16:18.753 --> 16:19.935
Right, right.

16:20.656 --> 16:21.498
Did you fly a lot?

16:21.518 --> 16:23.641
I mean, you were on a few days and off a few days?

16:24.522 --> 16:25.664
You could fly 18 months.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.407
Yeah, for 18 months.

16:27.708 --> 16:34.194
When you got back, did you get to have a little R&R every time you got back or were you right back on the plane again?

16:34.214 --> 16:38.258
No, we would be back maybe a couple of days and then have to go out on another flight.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.219
Right, right.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.723
And you talked about the people that you picked up and transported.

16:43.743 --> 16:49.569
These are people that both had physical issues and psychological issues and mental issues.

16:49.629 --> 16:53.433
So you really sort of ran the whole gamut of what you saw and what you cared for.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.053
Is that right?

16:54.073 --> 16:54.694
That's right.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.434
Right, right.

16:57.055 --> 17:02.681
You remarried and you married a pilot, Mr. Von Roeder.

17:03.082 --> 17:03.682
Right.

17:03.702 --> 17:04.864
At the time.

17:04.884 --> 17:08.408
And he had been a pilot there at Kelly Air Force Base, right?

17:08.948 --> 17:12.052
He had just come back from Okinawa.

17:12.493 --> 17:12.633
Uh-huh.

17:14.154 --> 17:14.495
I see.

17:14.955 --> 17:19.020
And you all were married.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.224
No longer married, but you have three children, three daughters.

17:22.244 --> 17:22.764
Is that right?

17:22.864 --> 17:23.145
Right.

17:23.185 --> 17:25.187
Talk about them, your daughters.

17:25.387 --> 17:34.440
Well, Deanne, the oldest daughter, lives here in Brun, and she's married to the chief of police, Elmer Snyder.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.001
Right.

17:35.822 --> 17:40.008
And she and her first husband had two children, Christopher and Courtney.

17:40.228 --> 17:41.349
Right.

17:41.370 --> 17:50.102
And after Deanne lost her husband, Joe, then she married Elmer Snyder, and he had lost his wife.

17:50.202 --> 17:50.663
Yes, ma'am.

17:51.324 --> 17:53.567
And he had a daughter.

17:53.627 --> 17:53.807
Mm-hmm.

17:55.559 --> 17:57.683
Elmer and Deanne have raised the three children.

17:57.864 --> 17:59.487
They've done a wonderful job.

17:59.748 --> 18:00.028
Right.

18:00.590 --> 18:05.741
Well, Elmer does a wonderful job here at Texas A&M as the chief of police, of course, at Texas A&M.

18:06.202 --> 18:07.164
Everybody knows Elmer.

18:07.384 --> 18:08.907
In fact, you know, he's too good.

18:08.927 --> 18:11.172
He never tells the children no.

18:11.152 --> 18:13.717
I heard you say that.

18:14.439 --> 18:19.689
My middle daughter, as you know, Jill died when she was 18 of cancer.

18:20.391 --> 18:31.794
And my youngest daughter, Penny, is married to Regan Richetsky, and she has one son, Preston.

18:32.034 --> 18:32.535
Yes, ma'am.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.602
And they live in Taylor.

18:34.863 --> 18:35.223
Right.

18:35.243 --> 18:38.189
She and her husband both work for the state of Texas.

18:38.209 --> 18:38.950
I see.

18:38.970 --> 18:39.270
I see.

18:39.811 --> 18:43.739
And Deanne, your oldest daughter, works at Texas A&M, I believe, in the purchasing department, right?

18:43.759 --> 18:44.540
Well, she's with A&M System.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.822
The system, in the purchasing.

18:45.842 --> 18:47.265
Director of purchasing for A&M System.

18:47.285 --> 18:48.126
In the purchasing department.

18:48.267 --> 18:48.748
Right.

18:48.768 --> 18:52.574
So you have a lot of family just right here in town.

18:52.594 --> 18:54.017
Right.

18:55.904 --> 18:57.226
That's a wonderful fact.

18:57.246 --> 19:03.294
We've got some photographs that came off of your wall and a couple of other photographs that I want to go to.

19:03.774 --> 19:10.002
And I want to talk about just a little bit some of the things that we've... This is a photograph of you in the Army.

19:10.523 --> 19:12.466
About how old do you think you were at that time?

19:13.227 --> 19:14.448
Well, let me see.

19:15.630 --> 19:16.411
I was born in 1921.

19:16.471 --> 19:19.835
That was in 45, so I was 24.

19:20.036 --> 19:21.518
You were 24 years old.

19:21.598 --> 19:21.878
Yeah.

19:23.562 --> 19:30.930
Army photograph and then we jump to the Air Force and I guess this was taken sort of an official photograph of Kelly.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.672
That was taken in 1950.

19:35.835 --> 19:41.721
When you were a first lieutenant and when you left active service you were a captain.

19:41.982 --> 19:42.642
That's right.

19:43.063 --> 19:45.866
Those are your captain's bars and tell us what else is in that picture.

19:45.886 --> 19:48.068
Well, Lieutenant Von Roeder

19:48.503 --> 19:52.529
I wanted our picture made together when I got my captain bars.

19:52.709 --> 19:55.873
And he was the first lieutenant.

19:56.074 --> 19:56.374
Right.

19:56.735 --> 19:59.639
And he said, only if you'll let me wear your bars.

19:59.679 --> 20:00.740
And I said, heck no.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.283
Those were my bars.

20:02.383 --> 20:04.606
Ironed those railroad tracks and I'm wearing them.

20:05.527 --> 20:06.228
Those were my bars.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.271
So needless to say, the picture was not made.

20:08.532 --> 20:08.892
Right.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.512
And there's your wings on top.

20:11.612 --> 20:15.476
My wings and discharge button, which is known as ruptured duck.

20:15.676 --> 20:16.817
Right, that's right.

20:16.838 --> 20:17.518
And your dog tag.

20:18.099 --> 20:19.981
And my dog tags, that's true.

20:20.301 --> 20:22.244
We talked about the William Beaumont General Hospital.

20:22.284 --> 20:26.348
This is a photograph that I came up with at about that time.

20:26.368 --> 20:32.315
So this is somewhat familiar with what you recall during World War II, right?

20:32.335 --> 20:32.415
Yes.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.457
It's changed quite a bit now.

20:34.497 --> 20:35.118
Yes, it has.

20:36.459 --> 20:39.823
Now, this you supplied to us, and this is...

20:40.411 --> 20:50.022
what we believe is the C-54 and this is the type of airplane that you flew out of Kelly as part of the 1734.

20:50.623 --> 21:04.579
Actually that picture was made at Gunner Air Force Base and when we were in flight school there we all wore parachutes but then when we flew

21:05.268 --> 21:07.891
with mats, you didn't wear one.

21:08.132 --> 21:09.513
Right.

21:09.533 --> 21:12.137
If the plane went down, you went down with the patients.

21:12.157 --> 21:13.078
I see.

21:13.098 --> 21:15.100
I see.

21:15.120 --> 21:15.461
I see.

21:17.523 --> 21:19.506
There's some great pictures there.

21:21.188 --> 21:33.503
When you were going to have Deanna, your oldest child, that was sort of when you knew your military career was going to be coming to an end because the military was not quite as understanding of

21:34.377 --> 21:36.200
Military women with children, right?

21:36.220 --> 21:36.961
Well, that's true.

21:37.602 --> 21:42.830
In the Army, if a female got married, you automatically got out.

21:42.851 --> 21:43.071
Uh-huh.

21:43.592 --> 21:43.812
Right.

21:44.052 --> 21:48.239
In the Air Force, you could be married, but you couldn't have a dependent under 16.

21:48.560 --> 21:48.800
Right.

21:50.242 --> 21:50.483
Right.

21:52.145 --> 21:52.486
Nope.

21:53.728 --> 21:55.811
So you left the service.

21:55.831 --> 22:01.380
I left the service, but I stayed in the Air Force Reserve, and

22:02.052 --> 22:08.559
My daughter was nine months old and I kept getting this questionnaire to send out, I mean, to fill out.

22:08.659 --> 22:12.723
And I knew when I did, that'd be the end of my military career.

22:13.184 --> 22:14.045
Right.

22:14.065 --> 22:16.107
Because you couldn't have a child under 16.

22:16.327 --> 22:16.668
I see.

22:17.068 --> 22:17.649
I see.

22:17.669 --> 22:17.929
So.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.433
So in 1953 is when you got out.

22:21.453 --> 22:22.534
Yeah, that's right.

22:22.794 --> 22:23.455
That's right.

22:23.535 --> 22:23.755
In 1953.

22:24.396 --> 22:29.241
So tell us what you've been doing or what you did do for some, what, 57 years, I guess.

22:29.677 --> 22:34.083
in starting in 1950 or 57 years total in nursing.

22:34.624 --> 22:41.334
But as a civilian nurse, sort of take us after Kelly and what you did.

22:41.774 --> 22:45.500
Oh, after Kelly, let me see.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.085
Yeah.

22:49.205 --> 22:53.631
Well, in 1965, 1966.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.414
Yes, ma'am.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.837
Back to Bryan College Station, permanently.

22:58.258 --> 23:00.463
I worked in the doctor's offices.

23:00.483 --> 23:02.527
I worked in the hospital.

23:03.128 --> 23:09.000
I retired from the Texas Department of Health in 1991 due to my son-in-law's illness.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.048
We surveyed nursing homes.

23:13.028 --> 23:14.391
I see.

23:14.411 --> 23:15.333
I see.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.737
And so, like I say, you work for private doctors?

23:17.777 --> 23:20.162
You work for hospitals?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.407
I work for Dr. McGill.

23:24.631 --> 23:25.633
He's now deceased.

23:25.713 --> 23:29.621
I work for Dr. Bobbitt, who's now relocated somewhere else.

23:30.944 --> 23:32.968
This was all in Bryan College Station, right?

23:32.988 --> 23:33.328
Yeah.

23:33.348 --> 23:34.210
Right, right.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.742
Right.

23:36.762 --> 23:46.198
And you, like I say, you stayed in nursing after in some 57 years or so total that you were in nursing.

23:46.258 --> 23:46.779
Is that right?

23:47.080 --> 23:47.781
Yeah.

23:47.801 --> 23:48.742
Somewhere about there.

23:49.003 --> 23:49.283
Right.

23:50.946 --> 23:52.448
Describe your passion for nursing.

23:52.468 --> 23:56.796
I mean, that you've had since you just a small child.

23:56.856 --> 24:01.243
I mean, it's just and I know that we and we talked about this, that you still have

24:01.814 --> 24:03.796
a passion for quality nursing.

24:04.097 --> 24:04.197
I do.

24:04.217 --> 24:06.559
And want to see it at every turn, right?

24:06.739 --> 24:07.060
I do.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.883
I've always enjoyed taking care of other people.

24:11.124 --> 24:22.477
And I think I told you when I go to the hospital and I see how the nursing is done now, it's all I can do to... I'll have to bite my tongue to keep from saying something.

24:22.497 --> 24:23.658
Right, right.

24:23.678 --> 24:25.380
Nursing is not what it used to be.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.641
Right, right.

24:27.062 --> 24:29.965
But there are nurses out there that want to... Oh, yes.

24:30.721 --> 24:31.643
keep the profession.

24:31.884 --> 24:33.989
That's right.

24:34.009 --> 24:38.861
But you know, nowadays you don't know who's a nurse, who's not a nurse.

24:39.382 --> 24:39.924
Why do you say that?

24:39.944 --> 24:44.796
They don't dress like nurses and a lot of times their tags are turned upside down.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.645
You can't read their tag to see who they are.

24:49.165 --> 24:51.187
One of those nurses to be listening to this out there.

24:51.207 --> 24:51.548
That's all right.

24:51.568 --> 24:56.794
You're getting a good lesson from a lady who is passionate about the business.

24:58.436 --> 25:06.325
Since you retired from the Texas Department of Health, and you said that one of the things that you did there was you surveyed nursing homes.

25:06.345 --> 25:06.486
Yes.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.409
Make sure that they were doing it right.

25:09.890 --> 25:10.250
Oh, yes.

25:10.390 --> 25:15.536
And that became a full-time job, I bet, because you found it both ways, that they were doing it right and that they weren't.

25:16.297 --> 25:16.978
That it did.

25:17.077 --> 25:21.806
Right, and you retired from that in 1991, and you live here now.

25:22.206 --> 25:32.225
You said that about seven years ago you were diagnosed with congestive heart failure, but you, as you tackled everything else in your life, you've tackled that.

25:32.826 --> 25:35.811
Talk about the regimen that you're on right now that you stick to.

25:36.128 --> 25:37.970
Supposed to stick to.

25:38.010 --> 25:54.167
Well, going from taking no medication except over-the-counter drug to 11 doses of medicine a day, low-fat, low-sodium diet, and exercise three times a week.

25:54.507 --> 25:56.550
I go to cardiac rehab three times a week.

25:58.392 --> 25:59.653
So that keeps me going.

25:59.673 --> 26:00.454
That keeps you going.

26:01.134 --> 26:02.596
And how do you feel?

26:02.616 --> 26:03.537
I feel good.

26:04.698 --> 26:10.989
It always makes you feel better to say you feel good than, oh, I don't feel so good.

26:11.149 --> 26:13.313
Right, right, right.

26:13.333 --> 26:26.295
But there's a lot of people at Cardiac Rehab that'll say, well, if that 88-year-old woman can do it, so can I. So I guess maybe I've been a little inspiration to some of them.

26:27.076 --> 26:27.757
Right.

26:27.777 --> 26:29.440
You'll be 89 in September of

26:29.960 --> 26:55.579
2010 that's correct and uh you certainly don't look it you don't act it so you sum up your your career in the military obviously you you you've got to be pleased with with what you were able to do how you were able to contribute to the war effort during world war ii in korea and your career in nursing how would you sum it up

26:57.263 --> 27:02.631
I wouldn't take anything in the world for the time that I spent in the military.

27:02.651 --> 27:04.915
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

27:04.935 --> 27:07.178
And I'd be back today if I wasn't too old.

27:07.198 --> 27:07.679
Yes, ma'am.

27:11.505 --> 27:17.715
If any young nurses ask you any tips, you'll be glad to give them to them, right?

27:20.138 --> 27:21.921
Like I say, nursing has changed.

27:22.930 --> 27:24.453
Nursing has changed a lot.

27:24.473 --> 27:26.416
Well, it's a fascinating story.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.458
It really is.

27:27.678 --> 27:35.873
And the stateside service of veterans, all veterans, and we've had several here on the show, is very essential.

27:35.913 --> 27:37.676
And I know that you believe that also.

27:37.816 --> 27:42.765
And thank you very much for being a part of this show, and especially thank you for your service.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.348
Well, you're quite welcome.

27:44.528 --> 27:46.592
It's a pleasure to meet you and to know you.

27:47.315 --> 28:03.401
Like we said from the outset, while Hazel Von Roeder's wish to serve where the wars were being fought was never really realized, her lifelong passion to care for and heal the ill and the wounded was the answer to a prayer for many of those who did.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.324
And we salute her service.

28:06.025 --> 28:06.967
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:07.147 --> 28:10.352
Be sure and join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
