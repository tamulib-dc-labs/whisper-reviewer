00:10.038 --> 00:34.324
Thank you.

00:36.565 --> 00:38.407
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.789
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:40.630 --> 00:47.818
Last week you met First Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey of Bryan, a 20-year Army veteran with a remarkable story to tell.

00:48.518 --> 00:57.629
Not just of his service in Germany, Korea, Alaska, two tours of Vietnam, and three weeks in Southside Chicago that he will never forget.

00:58.269 --> 01:01.493
Today he'll talk about that and his second hitch in Vietnam.

01:01.726 --> 01:08.236
where he returned home with a second Purple Heart and a Silver Star, the third highest award given by the military.

01:08.276 --> 01:13.484
So please welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, 1st Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey of Bryan.

01:13.665 --> 01:15.207
Jeffrey, it's great to be back.

01:15.828 --> 01:25.303
A remarkable story that you told us last week of your tours in Germany and Alaska and going to Vietnam for the first time.

01:25.638 --> 01:52.303
let's move on after your first tour of vietnam you said that you came back to fort hood and uh as a chief tactical instructor uh april 4th 1968 dr martin luther king was assassinated and talk about how that caused what you did next and what your next deployment was going to chicago how did that all come about okay first of all i'm glad to be back

01:53.296 --> 02:00.327
And coming out of Vietnam, I was assigned as a chief tactical instructor at the 3rd Corps NCO Academy.

02:00.347 --> 02:00.587
Yes, sir.

02:01.268 --> 02:07.678
And kind of turning that down, I chose to go back with the line unit infantry.

02:08.359 --> 02:17.574
So I wound up back up there with a lifelong friend of mine, which is deceased now, 1st Sergeant Swarford and others.

02:19.296 --> 02:21.700
And they had just activated this unit.

02:23.502 --> 02:29.830
made up primarily of people who could not, would not, didn't want to go to Vietnam, one of them light infantry units.

02:31.913 --> 02:33.795
So we had the worst of the worst.

02:35.537 --> 02:47.513
And the mission, as soon as we began to get personnel in, the primary mission, in addition to being combat ready, became riot control training.

02:47.813 --> 02:53.340
And my battalion was the primary riot control

02:53.607 --> 03:21.572
organization on post and other supporting units and we trained up and got ready to go whenever called out our primary target was new orleans followed by houston and so far as i could tell those two cities missed the revolution right there was never any call for troops in either one of those cities

03:22.143 --> 03:28.989
But after the death of Martin Luther King, we got alerted on the second day or so there after he was assassinated.

03:29.930 --> 03:32.873
And we did get the call, but we didn't go to New Orleans.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.735
In fact, we didn't know where the target was.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.256
We knew where it should be.

03:37.477 --> 03:38.478
You know, it's a guessing game.

03:38.498 --> 03:40.099
We're going to New Orleans or Houston.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.561
Nothing going on either direction.

03:42.581 --> 03:45.644
But we wound up going to Chicago.

03:45.704 --> 03:48.607
This was announced after we got down to Burstrom Air Force Base.

03:50.789 --> 03:51.289
And...

03:53.328 --> 03:56.152
We went and we did the job that we were sent to do.

03:57.994 --> 04:00.417
You flew, and I think you said you flew in a 747.

04:00.457 --> 04:00.718
747.

04:01.058 --> 04:02.280
Right.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.461
In a passenger jet.

04:03.481 --> 04:04.022
That's right.

04:04.062 --> 04:10.630
The Army either commanded it or leashed or had on standby X number 747 schedule.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.932
Moved troops around the country.

04:12.453 --> 04:12.573
Right.

04:12.593 --> 04:14.856
And we flew first class on a 747.

04:15.016 --> 04:21.985
If you consider combat loaded, every man has got his basic load of ammunition included.

04:22.724 --> 04:25.530
It wasn't a pleasure cruise.

04:25.811 --> 04:27.254
You were combat ready.

04:27.375 --> 04:34.852
You had your basic load of ammunition, bayonets, steel pots, flak jackets.

04:34.872 --> 04:36.295
You went for

04:37.085 --> 04:39.708
It was a combat situation so far as we were concerned.

04:39.928 --> 04:41.050
You've been to Vietnam.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.510
That's right.

04:41.530 --> 04:42.411
You faced an enemy there.

04:42.631 --> 04:43.052
That's right.

04:43.072 --> 04:54.805
But this, when you're on that airplane, I guess you're a little bit anticipating what kind of resistance you're going to be facing in this sort of a situation on an American street in Chicago.

04:54.825 --> 04:59.211
Well, I don't know if you have time to do that.

04:59.391 --> 05:03.936
It never occurred to me to think of it in those terms because, number one,

05:04.895 --> 05:07.458
You know what your mission is.

05:07.478 --> 05:14.025
It's to control people with a minimum amount of force and casualties and stuff like that.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.928
But you are armed to the teeth.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.753
You've got your M60 machine guns, your .50 calibers.

05:20.773 --> 05:24.377
You've got everything you need to do this job.

05:24.397 --> 05:34.107
And if you're mission-oriented and you have sworn allegiance to those above you, starting with the President of the United States, you're going to carry out the mission.

05:34.448 --> 05:34.648
Right.

05:35.287 --> 05:43.796
You don't get a lot of time to pick and choose your battles or think about whether or not you agree with the decision.

05:44.316 --> 05:49.181
Once the decision is made, the mission becomes mine to execute.

05:49.581 --> 05:50.602
And that's all I need to do.

05:51.143 --> 05:51.884
Talk about the mission.

05:51.964 --> 05:55.808
What did you find when you got to Southside Chicago?

05:56.749 --> 05:58.891
Well, okay, fine.

05:59.431 --> 06:03.015
But just prior to departing Fort Hood,

06:03.080 --> 06:12.120
getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning, mustering and drawing your weapon out of the armed room, getting your basic load of ammunition on palletized, ready to go.

06:13.062 --> 06:19.737
I had one man that came to me and said, first sergeant, I don't want to go to Chicago.

06:22.163 --> 06:22.303
And

06:23.043 --> 06:25.365
I looked at him because I knew exactly where he's coming from.

06:25.426 --> 06:31.292
I just said, now, is it that you don't want to go or you're telling me you don't want to go or you're not going?

06:31.812 --> 06:32.893
He said, oh, no, no, no, no.

06:33.274 --> 06:35.476
I'm saying I don't want to go.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.039
If you tell me to go, I'm going, I'm going to do the job I'm assigned.

06:38.459 --> 06:39.080
I said, fine.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.843
Go over there and report to First Sergeant Swofford.

06:41.863 --> 06:45.527
That's my friend who had the red detachment, going to stay at Fort Hood.

06:47.108 --> 06:48.730
We got down to Chicago.

06:49.604 --> 06:57.995
And we flew out of Burstam Air Force Base in Austin on the 747s we were talking about.

06:59.538 --> 07:09.071
As we came into Chicago, came into O'Haraville, I remember the city, a parlor smoke hanging over the city at about 3,000 feet.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.996
Looks like the whole city is burning down.

07:13.837 --> 07:19.685
We did plane, and within an hour, we were in Grant Park out on the shores of Lake Michigan.

07:20.726 --> 07:22.168
There was no riots out there.

07:24.131 --> 07:25.272
Absolutely none.

07:26.234 --> 07:37.549
We set up bivouac in the park that night and moved out at 9 o'clock the next morning, downtown Chicago, Southside, and that's where the riots were going on.

07:37.569 --> 07:40.132
And that's where our action took place.

07:40.813 --> 07:42.055
We got organized together.

07:44.498 --> 08:11.350
Within 30 minutes after we got there, within an hour after we moved into, because we moved from Grant Park, 9 o'clock the next morning by bus, with escorts you wouldn't believe, like every police officer with a car, MPs with Jeeps, and I don't know who they belonged to, but they were there.

08:12.494 --> 08:26.434
Sheriff's people, FBI, just about everybody you could see escorted us downtown to Jackson Park, which was also my first experience with organized gangs, per se.

08:27.836 --> 08:31.761
We talk about the Crips and the Blood, something that several years ago was a problem.

08:32.503 --> 08:37.850
They should be introduced to the Blackstone Rangers, the granddaddy of some of the gangs.

08:38.291 --> 08:38.451
Right.

08:39.173 --> 08:54.407
We de-planed, de-bust in Jackson Park, formed up in formation, and that's the first conflict right there because hecklers come along.

08:55.848 --> 09:00.653
And they start harassing the troops, girls in miniskirts and guys, you know.

09:01.934 --> 09:07.459
But once you call out one squad, fix bayonets,

09:08.013 --> 09:10.817
They'd break that one up in a hurry, and that was all over.

09:10.958 --> 09:11.939
That got their attention.

09:12.360 --> 09:12.600
Right.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.944
By 4 o'clock that afternoon, we were on the streets, though.

09:15.444 --> 09:16.045
Right.

09:16.065 --> 09:17.027
And we had it there.

09:17.908 --> 09:18.770
We locked it down.

09:19.671 --> 09:21.734
We was on the streets for 32 hours at 100%.

09:23.617 --> 09:25.039
We learned a lot of things.

09:25.961 --> 09:28.865
Number one, you can stand.

09:29.005 --> 09:34.594
I had a .50 caliber mounted on the top of the building, and you can stand on the top of the building

09:35.317 --> 09:39.966
And you can see three quarters of a mile in any direction up and down the street.

09:39.986 --> 09:46.859
You can always tell where the fight or the riot is fixed to break out because it's like watching a stream of water.

09:46.899 --> 09:50.846
There go two individuals, a third one joining, four, five, six.

09:51.447 --> 09:55.234
And pretty soon it looks like a moving, flowing stream.

09:55.254 --> 09:57.679
And all you got to do is cut off that stream and

09:58.165 --> 10:00.087
you disrupt the riot.

10:00.107 --> 10:06.675
If you give it time, if it's at night and you can't see them that well, you listen for the breaking glass.

10:06.955 --> 10:13.723
When you hear the glass breaking, you know where all the liquor stores are because that's the first thing you break into.

10:13.743 --> 10:18.468
Get the liquor, then we'll get the dry goods or burn the place down just for the hell of it.

10:19.309 --> 10:20.831
But it was a unique experience.

10:21.832 --> 10:22.553
What were your

10:23.444 --> 10:25.667
What were your personal thoughts during this time?

10:25.747 --> 10:28.251
Dr. King had been assassinated two days before.

10:28.772 --> 10:36.083
What were your personal thoughts as a black soldier who embraced Dr. King's belief of peace?

10:36.163 --> 10:42.252
What were your own thoughts in the mission that you were asked to perform?

10:42.272 --> 10:42.632
Okay.

10:44.595 --> 10:49.202
You don't, with me, you have a lot of time prior to this.

10:49.442 --> 10:52.647
By now, I've probably been in the Army 15 years.

10:52.827 --> 10:53.248
Yes, sir.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.970
So I've been in this game for a while.

10:56.990 --> 11:05.560
I've had time to evaluate all of the situations, the relationship between races and so forth.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.722
So I'm pretty well set at where I'm at.

11:08.843 --> 11:23.539
And you gotta realize that growing up in Brazos County, Texas, it wasn't my idea of a Upatone race thing.

11:24.751 --> 11:33.140
And one of the reasons why I stayed in the Army was because I was drafted, first of all, we've neglected that.

11:33.661 --> 11:35.563
I didn't volunteer, I was drafted.

11:35.583 --> 11:49.999
But after being in the Army a year, I realized that the playing field wasn't level, but it was certainly so much more level than it was here, and I stayed in.

11:50.131 --> 11:58.662
because I not only could render service to my country, but I could also advance within the limits of my own ability to a certain extent.

11:59.523 --> 12:09.836
So going into there, we had already been through the dogs in Alabama with Lester Maddox and his pickaxes and Bull Connors with his dogs and stuff.

12:09.856 --> 12:12.740
So you already know what's right and wrong.

12:13.020 --> 12:18.467
But you have also been through the rhetoric of the Black Panthers and other

12:19.055 --> 12:46.598
violent perpetuating groups and that wasn't the answer so when you get into a riot situation you accomplish nothing but destruction you need to talk and i am duty-bound to enforce whatever orders are issued so that's where i stood that's why i could let that boy leave that guy back at uh fort hood

12:47.810 --> 12:54.823
And on the second morning when we were in Grand Park, the colonel came over.

12:54.843 --> 12:58.290
He said, first sergeant, how many people you bring with you?

12:58.310 --> 12:59.352
I told him.

12:59.372 --> 13:01.155
He says, you're missing one, aren't you?

13:01.175 --> 13:01.656
I said, yes.

13:01.696 --> 13:02.678
He said, where is it?

13:02.698 --> 13:03.540
I said, I left him back.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.061
He said, why?

13:04.121 --> 13:04.542
I told him.

13:04.682 --> 13:05.323
You know what he said?

13:05.423 --> 13:06.185
He said, that's fine.

13:06.906 --> 13:07.928
You did the right thing.

13:09.410 --> 13:14.498
But that was the way the unit was trained, and we were probably 40% black.

13:15.500 --> 13:22.591
And they got more anxious to do their job when they found out the rioters were really burning down and killing their own people.

13:22.692 --> 13:23.653
They were not.

13:26.097 --> 13:32.127
They might have gotten more support if they had been out in Grant Park burning down that area of town, but they weren't.

13:32.444 --> 13:40.173
I want to go to a few photos right now that will sort of go along with the story that we've told.

13:40.293 --> 13:42.957
One photo here, this first one, if we look at it.

13:43.357 --> 13:44.699
We saw this photo last week.

13:44.759 --> 13:46.261
People didn't see the show last week.

13:46.481 --> 13:49.444
That was you after your first tour of Vietnam.

13:49.464 --> 13:53.389
And I guess just prior to this deployment to Chicago.

13:53.409 --> 13:55.872
This was about 1967 or so, I believe you told me.

13:55.952 --> 13:56.893
That would be right.

13:56.913 --> 13:58.215
Right, okay.

13:58.195 --> 14:13.239
This is a photo from an obviously an aerial photo of this sort of is in line of sort of how you described what things looked like when you flew into Chicago with the with the smoke rising from the streets.

14:13.260 --> 14:21.553
If we could I'd like to stop the photos right now and we're going to visit a little bit about Vietnam and then we'll come back with a couple of more photos here in just a second.

14:22.445 --> 14:32.819
Before we leave the Chicago service, I wanted to read what one of the person wrote who was actually a witness to the days following the assassination.

14:32.839 --> 14:43.052
He said, by Saturday, April the 6th, this would have been two days after the assassination, 6,000 National Guard troops had arrived in Chicago to suppress the riots and to protect firefighters in the field.

14:43.454 --> 14:44.858
The following day, 5,000 U.S.

14:45.199 --> 14:47.806
Army troops arrived to further curtail the rioters.

14:47.826 --> 14:51.415
And by Monday, the riots had dissipated and the fires were extinguished.

14:51.435 --> 14:56.047
So all together, you all pretty much stopped the riots over the weekend.

14:56.870 --> 14:59.657
In the end, only one firefighter was wounded by gunfire.

14:59.975 --> 15:05.872
12 civilians were killed, 170 buildings were destroyed, resulting in millions of dollars of damage.

15:05.952 --> 15:13.815
So the idea to protect lives for the most part, although tragically 12 civilians were killed, you all did your job.

15:14.825 --> 15:15.927
We try to.

15:16.187 --> 15:16.908
Exactly.

15:16.928 --> 15:19.732
There's one thing I'd like to point out about the picture.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.813
I had been in Chicago.

15:21.494 --> 15:23.958
My father-in-law lived in Chicago, Southside Chicago.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.643
So I'd been in Chicago a couple of times prior to the riots.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.446
Didn't know the city or anything.

15:29.866 --> 15:40.401
But when you are sightseeing or traveling as a visitor, you can only see whatever is in your field of vision.

15:40.962 --> 15:41.102
Mm-hmm.

15:41.487 --> 15:46.094
Consequently, you can't see the next street over.

15:46.274 --> 15:51.903
And when we came in with the riots, you can't see the buildings that's burning on the next block.

15:51.923 --> 15:53.745
You can see those that's right here.

15:56.189 --> 16:09.268
Now, when I go back into Chicago years later, like I was up there three or four years ago, we've been back two or three times since then, you have a different perspective of it.

16:09.589 --> 16:10.971
Because now,

16:11.153 --> 16:18.803
You can see the vacant spots that used to be these mass solid one block tenants housing.

16:18.823 --> 16:24.750
You can see through the vacant space to the next three street.

16:24.770 --> 16:31.859
You know what the reason is, you know the cause, but you couldn't see that before and you couldn't see it during, but you can see it now.

16:32.199 --> 16:38.988
The topography of the area has changed because these lots are still vacant.

16:39.008 --> 16:39.929
They haven't rebuilt.

16:40.810 --> 16:40.890
Wow.

16:41.056 --> 16:51.906
I had a boy that was walking the guard up and down his mother's house, in front of his mother's house.

16:51.926 --> 17:02.476
I had one that the Blackstone Ranger told him he could not come back to Chicago ever because they were going to... Didn't worry anybody, didn't.

17:02.497 --> 17:08.262
I did take the boy off the streets, put him on that 50 on the roof to protect him, but...

17:10.435 --> 17:11.898
We did what we needed to do.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.763
And he was protecting Mama's house.

17:13.783 --> 17:14.785
That's right.

17:14.805 --> 17:15.346
Bless his heart.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.217
Second tour of Vietnam, Company E, 1st Battalion, 12th Cav.

17:21.881 --> 17:24.868
Talk about your second tour, how it was different a little bit from the first tour.

17:24.908 --> 17:27.634
I know you talked to me about a difference in...

17:28.070 --> 17:37.686
and how you engaged the enemy, how the enemy engaged you, learning to travel, sort of learn from the enemy as far as traveling in small groups.

17:38.347 --> 17:41.272
Talk about sort of the nature of your second tour of Vietnam.

17:41.292 --> 17:45.419
Well, the second tour was different primarily in approach.

17:46.201 --> 17:50.668
With the Vietnamese, it was a kind of let's live and let's live.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.716
We don't really hunt down the enemy.

17:53.917 --> 17:56.359
If they attack you, then you defend yourself.

17:56.820 --> 17:59.943
But we were not out there with the 10th Army Division.

18:00.423 --> 18:03.607
It was not a let's go out and find them and destroy.

18:04.388 --> 18:08.071
But when you came to the camp, you had to get reoriented.

18:08.091 --> 18:12.256
Because now your job here now is to search and destroy.

18:12.276 --> 18:18.242
It is to find, fix, and annihilate or neutralize.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.750
You are in an attack mode with the American army.

18:23.131 --> 18:33.402
In Baghdad or in Afghanistan, those guys are not just out there kind of keeping the peace.

18:33.422 --> 18:35.364
They're looking for action.

18:36.525 --> 18:39.288
That is the nature of the beast.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.032
And with the cab, you're going to get it.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.645
because that's their mission.

18:48.926 --> 18:58.336
I found it to be vastly different about what I had been trained to expect my entire military career.

19:00.018 --> 19:01.360
You got more than you needed.

19:02.901 --> 19:07.146
It's like always, in order to accomplish the mission,

19:07.902 --> 19:10.646
You sometimes have to go outside of the box.

19:10.666 --> 19:17.516
As a result, we devised and had certain little units that did special things.

19:17.536 --> 19:23.745
I had a hunter-killer team as an example that was not a part of the table of organization and equipment, the TONE.

19:25.127 --> 19:26.930
We just organized it.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.812
We had snipers.

19:30.054 --> 19:33.098
I had a section of snipers.

19:33.679 --> 19:36.964
That wasn't organized according to TONE.

19:37.973 --> 19:45.729
but the commanders found them to be useful because you can take a sniper and put him with every company or platoon.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.013
He did special operations, special mission.

19:48.454 --> 19:52.222
By this time though, the entire mission in Vietnam had changed.

19:52.763 --> 19:58.615
We were into a holding pattern or a small unit...

19:59.135 --> 20:00.276
type field operation.

20:00.296 --> 20:06.202
We changed commanders, West Molan was gone and it was a small unit type operation.

20:08.183 --> 20:18.633
We also, there was another incident in that second tour that I failed to mention.

20:18.653 --> 20:26.020
One of the first units out of our battalion,

20:27.569 --> 20:30.354
during the Cambodian invasion was guess who?

20:31.375 --> 20:34.160
That hunter killer team of mine and me.

20:34.981 --> 20:44.917
We had, we was taking in a 105 artillery piece, gonna sit it on the ground with the crew on one helicopter.

20:47.081 --> 20:54.673
A bulldozer slung under the second helicopter with the tracks and blade off on a third helicopter.

20:55.615 --> 21:13.494
and we go in a small force, being eight of us at this time, not counting the artillery crew and the engineer squad, the security area, and right behind us, practically at the same time landing, is supposed to be an infantry company.

21:13.874 --> 21:14.735
Well, guess what?

21:15.356 --> 21:24.846
The artillery crew and the engineer crew, which was on the second craft of the engineers,

21:26.564 --> 21:34.475
They didn't land because the first, that Black Hawk of ours landed, my crew was off.

21:35.276 --> 21:48.274
The artillery is slung beneath the belly of a C-133, not a C-133, a helicopter, transport cargo helicopter.

21:48.294 --> 21:54.462
And the ammunition is slung below that, the gun and then the ammunition.

21:55.032 --> 21:57.115
They cut the ammunition loose.

21:57.135 --> 22:00.480
Now they should move up 50 feet, drop the gun.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.121
They don't.

22:01.582 --> 22:03.885
The crew chief cut that gun loose right there.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.830
It landed on top of the ammunition, flipped over.

22:07.430 --> 22:12.318
Now the artillery crew refused to get off the aircraft because they can't lift it back by themselves.

22:13.459 --> 22:18.747
Engineers can't land in there because there's space just for about one cargo helicopter per.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.550
Short story is

22:21.323 --> 22:28.973
We wound up there on the ground, me and my people, that night with orders to secure that helicopter and ammunition.

22:29.394 --> 22:35.522
And we're in Cambodia, which was... It depends on your outlook.

22:38.045 --> 22:40.388
It's been compared to be shooting fish in a bow.

22:41.249 --> 22:42.911
The enemy weren't expecting you.

22:42.931 --> 22:44.113
They didn't know you were coming.

22:44.153 --> 22:46.136
They didn't even recognize you.

22:46.636 --> 22:49.440
So I...

22:49.775 --> 22:56.746
We were going down a trail, came around Little Lake, looks over there, and there's a guy leaning up beside a bunker just watching us, just at home.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.050
He doesn't recognize us as the enemy.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.472
He didn't know.

23:02.335 --> 23:06.362
So if you were kind of laying to mix it up, that was the place to be.

23:06.963 --> 23:08.205
We've got about five minutes left.

23:08.405 --> 23:14.391
22 November 1969, serving in Tainan Province.

23:15.972 --> 23:20.997
Talk about the action that led to your being awarded the Silver Star.

23:23.099 --> 23:29.565
Once again, we was out with that hunter-killer team, and this time we got a captain from the S-2 out.

23:29.585 --> 23:37.112
We received information that the boundary between the 1st Cal Division and the 25th Infantry Division

23:38.172 --> 23:45.500
were being utilized as a transportation communications alley for the NVA.

23:45.520 --> 23:53.970
And this was established because neither unit could shoot to within 200 meters of this boundary line without getting permission from the other.

23:53.990 --> 24:00.958
So if the enemy sits out there one night and watches, he knows that you're shooting up to here from that direction, up to here from that direction, but you're not shooting here.

24:01.259 --> 24:05.023
So he just safely walks down the highway or down the trail.

24:05.476 --> 24:10.561
So we took that crew out there to ambush this thing and we did.

24:11.362 --> 24:17.708
We killed two people and attempted an extraction by the battalion commander with his aircraft.

24:18.389 --> 24:22.253
And that went nowhere except with 13 bullet holes in it.

24:22.273 --> 24:26.517
And then we must run and fought for the next four hours and got three other aircraft shot up.

24:26.537 --> 24:28.039
I don't know how many people wounded.

24:28.559 --> 24:31.382
Short story was they could not extract us.

24:32.341 --> 24:41.089
And we lost one KIA in that and two people wounded and wound up with only three or four people.

24:41.289 --> 24:51.099
And being extracted, eventually, one of those outside the box deals we talked about, about a captain from the 25th Infantry Division.

24:51.119 --> 24:53.561
He had an armored outfit.

24:54.522 --> 25:01.048
And he had told me early in the day when he inserted us while on a resupply run into our location,

25:01.552 --> 25:04.897
And if I got in trouble to call him, I did, and he responded.

25:04.917 --> 25:05.838
He got us out of that.

25:07.661 --> 25:10.204
So I have a strong affection for that man today.

25:10.485 --> 25:12.107
I'll bet you do.

25:12.127 --> 25:15.592
I want to read the citation where you were awarded the Silver Star.

25:16.633 --> 25:20.539
It says 22 November 1969.

25:20.857 --> 25:24.022
while serving in the Tianan Province Republic of Vietnam.

25:24.042 --> 25:31.072
When a force led by 1st Sergeant Bailey left their position, they encountered intense automatic weapons fire.

25:31.092 --> 25:36.941
1st Sergeant Bailey repeatedly exposed himself to the hostile fire to pull the wounded to safety.

25:36.961 --> 25:46.154
His gallant action is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.

25:46.174 --> 25:50.661
The Silver Star, obviously, it's an award that you own proudly.

25:51.485 --> 25:52.667
Yes, that would be true.

25:54.529 --> 25:54.890
Yes.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.814
I don't need any more.

25:58.535 --> 26:02.941
Right.

26:03.381 --> 26:06.366
Your awards and commendations are many among them.

26:08.068 --> 26:10.712
From 62 to 65, Army Commendation Medal.

26:11.513 --> 26:15.298
May of 67, Awarded Army Commendation Medal with Valor Device.

26:15.937 --> 26:18.560

26:23.326 --> 26:26.069

26:33.097 --> 26:35.680

26:35.700 --> 26:38.824

26:39.585 --> 26:44.070
And January of 1973, upon your retirement, the Army

26:44.472 --> 26:47.156
commendation medal, and that was just a few.

26:47.176 --> 26:52.403
And a matter of fact, we have a photograph right there of your medal box.

26:52.423 --> 26:56.008
You can see the Purple Heart, and to the right of it, the Silver Star.

26:57.129 --> 27:07.243
And there's the certificate, the Silver Star certificate.

27:08.465 --> 27:10.408
Very proud as well you should be.

27:10.428 --> 27:11.109
We're out of time.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.192
There's so much more to tell, but we're out of time.

27:13.212 --> 27:14.293
But thank you for your service.

27:14.543 --> 27:15.504
And thank you for being here.

27:15.524 --> 27:16.466
Thank you for having me.

27:16.486 --> 27:16.866
All right.

27:17.187 --> 27:17.827
Thank you.

27:17.847 --> 27:26.840
Jeffrey Bailey retired from the Army 31 January 1973, the same year that he started Bailey Trucking, which he and his family still operate today.

27:27.420 --> 27:31.927
He and Ora have been married some 53 years and have four children and five grandchildren.

27:31.967 --> 27:36.433
We salute Jeffrey Bailey for his two decades of brave military service.

27:36.453 --> 27:37.334
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:37.354 --> 27:39.657
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:51.365 --> 28:03.990
you
