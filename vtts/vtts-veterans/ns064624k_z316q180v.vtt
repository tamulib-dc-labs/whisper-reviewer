00:08.485 --> 00:33.632
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.053 --> 00:35.134
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.481 --> 00:43.032
It was December of 1944 and America's involvement in World War II was in its fourth winter.

00:43.052 --> 00:46.217
Rewind seven months, teenager Frank Kocman Jr.

00:46.538 --> 00:52.367
had just graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School and Uncle Sam was already calling.

00:52.387 --> 00:55.953
In fact, Frank needed a student deferment just to finish high school.

00:55.973 --> 01:03.265
By July, 18-year-old Frank Kocman was drafted and was on his way to Fort Sam and on to what was then called Camp Hood.

01:03.886 --> 01:09.615
thought he was being trained to fight the Japanese in the South Pacific, but that all changed.

01:09.635 --> 01:12.179
Germany had become even more of a hotspot.

01:12.199 --> 01:16.806
Hitler was planning a winter push through Europe that would result in the Battle of the Bulge.

01:17.707 --> 01:21.573
Private Frank Kocman's infantry unit was needed in the European theater.

01:22.294 --> 01:25.980
It was a fast track from high school to the front lines of the war.

01:26.781 --> 01:27.903
Frank Kocman, welcome.

01:27.923 --> 01:30.807
It's a pleasure to visit with you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:31.228 --> 01:32.830
You're 18 years old.

01:33.181 --> 01:41.729
just barely out of high school, and eight months later, you're amid 30-foot snowdrifts in France, and you're fighting a war.

01:41.789 --> 01:44.372
That had to be quite an impression on a young man.

01:44.392 --> 01:45.453
Well, it certainly was.

01:45.573 --> 02:01.568
It was a big change for me, especially the snowdrifts that were 25 and 30 feet deep, because coming from Central Texas here, one or two inches of snow rarely in a period of time.

02:02.257 --> 02:06.143
One inch compared to 25 or 30 feet, big change.

02:06.744 --> 02:07.205
You're right.

02:07.826 --> 02:09.388
Indeed.

02:10.450 --> 02:11.632
Talk about going over there.

02:11.672 --> 02:22.530
We had visited earlier and you said that the Army was pretty cognizant of your shots and getting over there and making sure that you were healthy once you got there, right?

02:22.550 --> 02:23.211
Well, that's right.

02:23.992 --> 02:24.653
Yes.

02:25.443 --> 02:47.499
On December the 21st, when we were assembled in a theater where the post commander was giving us the news about the Battle of the Bulls ongoing in Germany at that time, he told us that we would be receiving shots at each of our stops throughout our travels to Europe.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.767
And that commander was exactly right about that because

02:53.320 --> 03:03.426
I think we had eight stops and we had about 12 or 15 shots, immunization shots given to us at each one of those places.

03:03.446 --> 03:07.998
The Army did an outstanding job of scheduling and coordinating those shots.

03:08.018 --> 03:08.359
Indeed.

03:08.879 --> 03:12.504
You're over there for about three weeks, and then talk about what happened then.

03:12.524 --> 03:14.766
You're sort of traded off under British command.

03:14.806 --> 03:15.888
Is that right, your unit?

03:15.908 --> 03:16.769
Yeah.

03:16.829 --> 03:22.136
The unit that I was in, the 79th Infraredivision, we were in Alsace at that time.

03:22.156 --> 03:25.340
That was my first venture into combat.

03:25.800 --> 03:37.755
We were traded to the British 21st Army Group up in the northern part of Luxembourg and Belgium and Holland.

03:38.478 --> 03:43.802
That was quite an experience because that was a different command.

03:43.822 --> 03:47.766
It had a different structure and all.

03:48.667 --> 03:53.431
You may want me to tell about having to sleep on the rooftop.

03:53.651 --> 03:57.414
Yeah, dams had been destroyed and there was flooding.

03:57.794 --> 04:01.257
That wasn't much fun, especially in that temperature, right?

04:01.277 --> 04:01.918
Well, that's right.

04:02.018 --> 04:03.239
It was real cold.

04:03.839 --> 04:08.383
There was water for as far as the eye could see.

04:08.903 --> 04:27.910
You know, you don't have any place to sleep except in tree trunks or chimneys on rooftops or in my case, I slept on top of a canvas deuce and a half truck and periodically I'd scoop the water off the canvas because the canvas held the water.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.432
But that was quite an experience.

04:30.794 --> 04:32.717
I want to show people what the young

04:32.967 --> 04:34.789
Frank Kocman looked like.

04:34.829 --> 04:39.174
I think we've got a photograph right now of you that we're going to show up here.

04:39.214 --> 04:39.714
There you are.

04:39.975 --> 04:40.395
Oh, gee.

04:41.196 --> 04:42.477
Young, good-looking soldier there.

04:42.517 --> 04:44.259
So how old would you have been in that photograph?

04:44.539 --> 04:47.963
Well, I'm sure that I was 19 years old.

04:47.983 --> 04:52.148
You were young and naive and probably had no idea what you were getting into.

04:52.248 --> 04:52.568
Is that right?

04:52.608 --> 04:54.310
Had no idea.

04:54.330 --> 05:02.839
Just coming from Brazos County, a small community, not having been associated with a lot of people.

05:03.089 --> 05:09.318
and getting into the army and then being over there, seeing new countryside for the first time ever in my life.

05:09.338 --> 05:12.062
I didn't even dream of that when I was in high school.

05:12.082 --> 05:12.423
Indeed.

05:13.404 --> 05:15.187
Talk a little bit about the resistance.

05:15.207 --> 05:25.622
I know that you did not fight actually in the Battle of the Bulge itself, but by the time that it was over, the Germans were starting to regroup and they were flanking the units that you were involved in.

05:25.642 --> 05:27.806
Talk a little bit about that and the resistance that you found.

05:28.066 --> 05:28.427
All right.

05:29.468 --> 05:30.750
Y'all, the Battle of the Bulge

05:31.321 --> 05:38.532
pretty well been resolved up in Belgium and Luxembourg by the time I got there on January the 17th.

05:39.092 --> 05:49.468
But the Germans had regrouped and had hit the American lines in the 7th Army area south in the southern part of France.

05:50.049 --> 05:55.376
Actually, it was in the eastern part of France in the Alsace-Lorraine area.

05:55.396 --> 05:59.202
And this is part of the foothills of the Swiss Alps.

05:59.958 --> 06:04.726
And that's where the mountains were, and that's where all of the snow was, and that's where I was at.

06:05.146 --> 06:15.322
The unit that I had been assigned to had fairly severe losses occurred just a few days before I got there.

06:16.063 --> 06:27.822
And we were supposedly in secondary defense, but secondary defense means that you're now subject to artillery and mortar fire as opposed to small arms.

06:28.544 --> 06:37.395
Our company was given, or battalion, I guess, was given the directive to move down into the flatlands near the banks of the Rhine River.

06:37.415 --> 06:39.818
And that's an infantry advance.

06:40.499 --> 06:43.363
And so that's where we went.

06:44.004 --> 06:53.255
And I can remember one of my squad sergeants telling me that he did all the thinking.

06:53.416 --> 06:58.382
I was only to take care of my front 25 yards to the left, 25 to the right.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.547
Straight ahead, he does all the thinking.

07:00.908 --> 07:02.910
So I was put in my place pretty quick.

07:03.371 --> 07:03.711
Indeed.

07:03.972 --> 07:13.144
You talked about crossing the Rhine River, that this was quite a dangerous thing, especially, and you were weighted down because that was part of your job.

07:13.164 --> 07:15.026
Talk about that and the dangers involved in that.

07:15.146 --> 07:16.208
Okay.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.329
I'd be happy to do that.

07:18.931 --> 07:28.504
We moved from Al South up to Holland to train for the Rhine River Crossing in March, late March of 1945.

07:29.159 --> 07:39.897
And at that time, I was the company runner, which meant that I hauled messages from the company commander to the platoon leader or vice versa.

07:42.582 --> 07:54.542
But when we crossed the Rhine River, one of the things that the organization was such that the runner carried the spare batteries for an SCR300 backpack radio.

07:55.028 --> 08:15.703
along with two or three rounds of bazooka, 3.5 rocket launcher, four or five bandoliers or .45 caliber ammunition, three days' worth of K-rations that we put in the various big cargo pockets that were on the uniform.

08:16.308 --> 08:22.777
So I think I had about 45 to 50 pounds of extra weight when we crossed the Rhine River.

08:23.758 --> 08:23.958
Wow.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.602
I was not in the assault wave.

08:26.682 --> 08:31.208
I was in the second wave following the assault wave by about 20 minutes.

08:34.032 --> 08:45.488
Fortunately, we did not meet any resistance, but had a mortar round or artillery round, landed close to the boat that we were in,

08:45.873 --> 08:53.603
it could have capsized that boat, and there was no doubt that I was not going, no one else in that boat would have survived with that kind of weight.

08:54.545 --> 08:57.769
Actually, you did lose comrades because of that.

08:57.789 --> 08:58.170
We actually did.

08:59.091 --> 09:03.096
Comrades that fell over who were weighted down that just could not survive that.

09:03.116 --> 09:04.078
That's correct.

09:04.358 --> 09:08.263
We had probably two dozen losses, I think.

09:08.283 --> 09:14.732
But got on the far bank, that's the east bank of the Rhine River,

09:15.404 --> 09:20.048
And in one particular action,

09:20.450 --> 09:28.901
The radio man and the forward observer and the platoon leader were, and myself, I was a few yards away.

09:29.582 --> 09:39.535
A large artillery round came in and exploded, and it put the radio man out of commission.

09:40.416 --> 09:50.389
And the executive officer, the company executive officer, came up, hollered for me to come up, said, you still have those batteries, the spare batteries.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.457
that radio.

09:52.477 --> 09:53.679
I responded that I did.

09:53.699 --> 09:56.122
He said, well, grab that radio and come with me.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.866
You're now the company radio man.

09:58.886 --> 10:01.029
And I can remember that very vividly.

10:01.049 --> 10:01.871
Rapid advancement.

10:02.171 --> 10:02.672
That's right.

10:03.413 --> 10:12.145
And I met the executive officer here in Bryan at one time in 1948 because he was working for Mutual of Omaha at that time.

10:12.726 --> 10:14.889
It is a small world when you talk about that.

10:15.049 --> 10:19.836
And referring to that, I believe that the commander of your unit actually before you got there

10:20.221 --> 10:26.549
was a colonel named Olin Tiger Teague, who you later would become friends with here in Bryan, right?

10:26.569 --> 10:28.332
That is absolutely correct.

10:28.352 --> 10:31.175
Colonel Teague was a real good personal friend.

10:31.196 --> 10:37.904
We became friends after I'd gotten back because I did not know him when we were in Alsace.

10:39.166 --> 10:45.835
Talk about you're on a jeep and you're crossing a bridge and you have an encounter with a German tank.

10:45.855 --> 10:46.656
Pretty scary deal.

10:46.996 --> 10:47.577
Yes, it was.

10:47.838 --> 10:48.979
Talk about that.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.912
I have to do a little graphics on it, maybe.

10:53.373 --> 10:54.014
You can describe it.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.555
You're sitting on the back of a Jeep, right?

10:55.575 --> 11:04.944
Well, we're crossing a bridge somewhat similar to one of the overpasses on, say, Earl Rudder Parkway over here.

11:05.865 --> 11:11.711
And artillery shells, enemy artillery shells, are coming in just in front of us.

11:11.731 --> 11:19.118
I'm sitting on the corner of this Jeep with this radio on my back, catching a ride.

11:20.077 --> 11:23.902
The companies only had two Jeeps, one for the commander and one for the supply sergeant.

11:23.922 --> 11:29.089
And I was on the commander's Jeep and sitting on the corner of it.

11:30.031 --> 11:49.577
And so the company commander's driver, when the artillery shells started landing in front and started hitting the bridge railing and cratering that, he shoved the gears into reverse on the Jeep and backed off that bridge.

11:50.148 --> 12:11.008
at a high rate of speed he stopped when he started up again I had lost my balance and he left me sliding across the part of the tarmac I guess it wasn't tarmac it was asphalt so consequently I had

12:11.343 --> 12:20.213
tore my uniforms on the elbows and the knees as I slid this 12 to 15 feet across the asphalt.

12:20.794 --> 12:22.636
Well, lost my helmet.

12:22.656 --> 12:33.469
He had pulled out, I guess the company commander directed that he get out and go pick me up because he needed his radio and it was strapped to my back.

12:34.023 --> 12:38.330
And they wanted to take you out of service because of your entries, but that's just something you just did not want to do.

12:38.350 --> 12:39.491
You did not want to do that.

12:39.552 --> 12:40.032
That's right.

12:40.092 --> 12:48.946
You wanted to stay with the people that you knew, you trusted, you had a relationship with, and if they said they'd be there, they'd be there.

12:49.407 --> 12:54.354
This is the kind of comradeship that is built in these units.

12:56.277 --> 12:57.419
After the war, VE Day.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.861
Talk about that day.

12:58.921 --> 12:59.542
Where were you?

12:59.582 --> 13:00.604
Talk about the celebration.

13:00.989 --> 13:09.338
Okay, we stopped in a place in northern Germany, the city was Dortmund, Germany.

13:09.358 --> 13:14.383
It had a population of over a half million, large industrial complex.

13:15.504 --> 13:26.275
We were bivouacked on a German airfield, either in pup tents or in some of the hangars or in some of the administrative buildings on that air base.

13:26.955 --> 13:30.439
Well, being under British control,

13:31.060 --> 13:36.608
Their fraternization rule was somewhat more lax than it was in the American sector.

13:37.810 --> 13:50.849
And so we were allowed to give civilians, whether they be displaced persons from Estonia or Lithuania or Russia or Finland or wherever, Holland, France, even Germans.

13:50.869 --> 13:57.338
So we were allowed to bring them on this area where we were bivouacking for a large suburb.

13:57.605 --> 14:01.670
celebration to occur the next day, May the 8th, 1945.

14:03.132 --> 14:12.444
And my sergeant directed that I give him my coupon, good for admission of someone from the outside.

14:12.864 --> 14:14.306
Of course, most of them were female.

14:16.249 --> 14:22.937
The woman that eventually became my wife, she came that day on May the 8th.

14:23.356 --> 14:35.575
Primarily because I think she had some desire to have her first American hamburger that our cooks were cooking for the people that were on that post.

14:35.595 --> 14:42.766
So a lot of the newsreels that were there taped a lot of people celebrating the E-Day.

14:42.786 --> 14:48.334
But a lot of those people that were celebrating the E-Day were also Germans and my wife.

14:48.567 --> 14:51.229
My future wife happened to be one of those.

14:51.249 --> 14:51.590
Right.

14:51.610 --> 14:56.094
They were just as happy that the war was over as were the Allies, certainly.

14:56.614 --> 14:58.356
The war in Europe was over.

14:58.376 --> 14:59.417
And then that's the next point.

14:59.437 --> 15:03.020
The war in Europe is over, but the war in Japan is still being fought.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.664
And I guess at that time, there were thoughts that there might be a ground war in Japan.

15:06.704 --> 15:09.406
That obviously all changed with the dropping of the bomb.

15:09.426 --> 15:15.672
But after VE Day, you were being trained actually to go over and fight the Japanese, right?

15:16.006 --> 15:16.747
That all changed.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.753
Talk about what happened after VE Day for you.

15:19.773 --> 15:21.296
Well, you're exactly right.

15:21.737 --> 15:34.562
The particular division that I was in, the 79th, they were transferring a lot of low point, low redeployment point men to that division because they were going to send it to the China, Burma, India theater.

15:35.544 --> 15:38.470
And I only had 38 points, so I was

15:38.804 --> 15:42.309
a resident of that division.

15:42.329 --> 15:50.781
And we were training up until the point that August 4th or 5th, whenever it was, that the atomic bomb was dropped.

15:51.442 --> 15:54.927
And at that time, well, all the training then ceased.

15:54.947 --> 15:56.830
And all of the

15:57.772 --> 16:08.607
Low Point men, lower than I think about 55, we were transferred to the Big Red One as Army of Occupation to serve as Army of Occupation duty.

16:09.048 --> 16:16.358
Whereas the other men that remained in the 79th, they came back to the States for ultimate discharge.

16:16.939 --> 16:21.906
But as I was telling you earlier, with the Big Red One,

16:22.645 --> 16:33.395
I had gone to that division and was serving it in and around Nuremberg, Germany, where the war crimes trials were taking place.

16:34.097 --> 16:35.220
And my duties there

16:36.415 --> 16:42.645
The Army had sent me to a school to learn to climb light poles or wooden poles, telephone poles.

16:43.506 --> 16:52.380
And we went into, we started rehabilitating the German civilian telephone systems.

16:52.540 --> 17:04.178
Some of the work that I did was where you may go along the railroad tracks here and see telephone poles with five cross arms and ten wires on each one of them.

17:04.613 --> 17:17.056
Well, that was part of my job was to reconstruct those and make them serviceable again for the American military as well as the civilian population over there.

17:18.077 --> 17:23.387
Reconstruct that country for the communications effort.

17:23.407 --> 17:27.735
And that's going to lead into something else, I'm quite sure.

17:27.901 --> 17:32.205
pretty good little bleep on your resume that would serve you well when you got back home.

17:32.445 --> 17:32.986
That's correct.

17:33.006 --> 17:33.286
That's right.

17:33.766 --> 17:34.807
We'll get to that in a minute.

17:34.927 --> 17:39.672
But a couple of things will backtrack a little bit.

17:39.812 --> 17:42.274
Talk about the lucky medal.

17:42.294 --> 17:42.534
Okay.

17:44.616 --> 17:57.368
When I came home at Christmas 1944, I had a five-day delaying route that began on December the 21st of 1944.

17:57.668 --> 18:02.795
By the time I got home, two days of that five days had already been used and just in getting home.

18:03.876 --> 18:11.947
And so my folks, my family, had a great big celebration on Christmas Day with a lot of my uncles and aunts and cousins.

18:12.728 --> 18:15.111
And it was at my mother and father's home.

18:15.832 --> 18:27.507
And one of my uncles who had served in World War I in the Musargonne Forest, who had been wounded there, he had a little religious icon picture.

18:28.178 --> 18:44.483
And he had whittled it out while he was in the hospital recovering from a wound that he had received in World War I. He took a little religious picture and placed it inside of an oval-shaped

18:45.779 --> 19:03.957
mirror that came in the crackerjack box he fixed the the mirror out cleaned the silvering off of the back side back of the mirror and uh installed that religious icon in there and then put the wood the glass back there and uh

19:04.561 --> 19:08.225
So this was a focal point for him.

19:08.245 --> 19:12.430
And our religion believes that you pray to an icon.

19:13.391 --> 19:14.592
It's a focal point.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.134
You don't pray to the icon.

19:16.655 --> 19:30.771
Anyhow, so that protected him in World War I. On Christmas Day, 1944, he gave me that medal and talked about his experiences in World War I. I carried that medal to Germany.

19:31.156 --> 19:33.779
to Europe with me and brought it back.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.163
I suffered no—I suffered nothing from it.

19:37.223 --> 19:38.865
I had—I was never wounded.

19:38.885 --> 19:45.833
I never—outside of those scrapes falling off that Jeep, came back in good shape.

19:46.694 --> 19:54.784
In 1950, he gave that—well, before 1950, I gave that medal back to him.

19:55.591 --> 20:02.824
In 1950, he gave it to his son who went to Korea and served in the Korean conflict.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.607
He came back unscathed.

20:05.408 --> 20:13.903
In 1964, I believe it was, my uncle gave that very same icon back to his family.

20:14.322 --> 20:18.947
grandson who was a gunner on a helicopter gunship in Vietnam.

20:19.848 --> 20:24.713
And this young man came back unscathed as well.

20:24.733 --> 20:38.068
And a few years ago, I asked this grandson if I could borrow that medal because I wanted to write some of the autobiographies of some of the people that carry that medal.

20:38.318 --> 20:45.807
That metal has quite a history to it, and I have it in my possession now, and I need to finish that project.

20:45.827 --> 20:46.167
Indeed.

20:46.248 --> 20:48.650
I'm sure it's a metal that doesn't get very far away from you.

20:48.670 --> 20:49.231
No, it doesn't.

20:49.552 --> 20:56.400
As a matter of fact, I have it secured in a locked place in my house with my wife's jewelry.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.024
I don't want to advertise where that's at, of course.

21:00.044 --> 21:01.626
Exactly where it should be, of course.

21:02.197 --> 21:04.521
I want to backtrack to another story, a very good story.

21:05.002 --> 21:10.351
December 7, 1941, obviously the day that does live in infamy.

21:10.371 --> 21:12.275
You were a 15-year-old Boy Scout.

21:12.295 --> 21:17.203
Talk about what happened that day and what the young, naive Frank Coachman thought about that day.

21:17.865 --> 21:18.987
Well, I'll tell you what.

21:20.048 --> 21:24.897
I can tell you what I thought about it, but everyone that was with me thought the same thing.

21:25.703 --> 21:33.293
Yeah, we had been out at Camp Aramon, which is north of, it was in eastern Robertson County, north of Bryan.

21:33.313 --> 21:34.254
Still there.

21:34.274 --> 21:35.195
Yeah, it's still there.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.176
Right.

21:36.196 --> 21:46.269
And we were on our way back from an outing there, and we'd come around through FM, what's now FM 50, and our steel store.

21:46.289 --> 21:52.117
At the steel store, we could see a large black flume of smoke coming from the Brazos River.

21:52.698 --> 21:53.719
So we drove over.

21:54.070 --> 22:07.343
there, which is not, you know, it's not a matter of three or four miles away, drove over there, and that trestle leading up to the bridge crossing the Brazos River on Highway 21 West was on fire.

22:07.363 --> 22:11.948
I'm sure some of our viewers today will no doubt remember that.

22:12.989 --> 22:21.597
And, of course, we started, I don't know whether we started it or whether we heard this, but the rumor was that that bridge had been bombed by the Japanese.

22:22.133 --> 22:30.387
We didn't know that the Japanese had actually bombed Pearl Harbor, but someone who had a radio had told us that.

22:30.407 --> 22:38.100
So we, most of the Boy Scouts, all of us really, we surmised that the Japs had bombed that bridge.

22:38.958 --> 22:42.663
Now, you can take Brazos County as a target for the Japanese.

22:43.805 --> 22:46.308
Well, we can get a chuckle out of that today, can't we?

22:47.249 --> 22:54.259
So the Japanese not only at Bob Pearl Harbor, but they also decided to get South Robertson County while they were at it also, right?

22:54.279 --> 22:59.606
That also, incidentally, probably the target there, if you don't mind my digressing a little bit.

23:00.247 --> 23:03.031
Just on the other side in Burleson County was whiskey.

23:03.551 --> 23:06.315
That was called Whiskey Bridge for the adults.

23:06.768 --> 23:14.316
And there was quite a large number of, there were several liquor stores there.

23:14.857 --> 23:17.520
So that must have been the target for the Japanese, the liquor.

23:18.761 --> 23:19.222
Well, who knows?

23:19.242 --> 23:22.405
I mean, Camp Hearn was a German POW camp during the war.

23:22.546 --> 23:24.287
Well, that happened later.

23:24.428 --> 23:26.450
That happened a little bit later, too.

23:27.271 --> 23:28.252
We've got a few more minutes.

23:28.833 --> 23:31.435
You finally come home.

23:31.455 --> 23:32.877
Yes.

23:33.717 --> 23:40.425
Let's talk about that climbing those telephone poles served you well because you came home and got yourself a job out of that deal.

23:40.446 --> 23:40.986
That's correct.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.048
I sure did.

23:42.068 --> 23:47.354
I went down to apply for some assistance that the Veterans Administration was giving.

23:47.474 --> 23:49.237
Actually, it was the Texas Employment Commission.

23:49.897 --> 23:51.359
They had a program called 5220.

23:51.399 --> 23:57.447
They would help you get a job, pay you $20 a week for up to 52 weeks.

23:58.355 --> 24:02.821
or until such time as they found you a job.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.767
Well, I went down there and applied for that because I was unemployed.

24:06.807 --> 24:09.791
I'd left a job that was a part-time job.

24:10.833 --> 24:20.947
And a few days after I applied, I got a letter from the Texas Employment Commission that I was to go for an interview with the local telephone company.

24:20.967 --> 24:25.594
I went down there, and they promptly hired me because I had had

24:26.047 --> 24:31.493
on my resume some experience of climbing telephone poles in Germany.

24:31.513 --> 24:36.699
And they just happened to need somebody that could fit that bill.

24:37.240 --> 24:52.797
Well, somewhere during the course of that, between the time I interviewed for the job and the time I reported for work, they changed my employment criteria to that of assisting a cable splicer.

24:53.435 --> 24:57.361
that they had had recall from retirement in 1941.

24:57.441 --> 25:00.825
The man's name was Jim Ellis.

25:00.845 --> 25:10.379
He had the expertise in splicing lead shield cable for the telephone company.

25:10.399 --> 25:14.705
And this man, as I recall, did not drive an automobile.

25:14.725 --> 25:16.928
He did not know how to drive.

25:16.948 --> 25:22.716
So one of my jobs was to chauffeur him to the job site to hoist

25:23.270 --> 25:29.079
his platform, cable splathing cap platform, up to the cable.

25:29.099 --> 25:33.365
And two other important criteria.

25:34.948 --> 25:43.901
One was to keep the paraffin hot in a pot on the ground that he was going to subsequently use to boil the water out of the cable.

25:44.462 --> 25:52.534
And the other one was to keep his pot of lead hot that he used to seal the sleeve that went over the lead cable.

25:53.122 --> 25:59.463
And he said, if you can do that, Frank, you'll be all right.

25:59.503 --> 26:01.048
We'll get along together real fast.

26:01.509 --> 26:05.663
And so consequently, I gave that job 100% effort.

26:06.284 --> 26:15.152
But that job did not pay enough to support a wife and a child that I subsequently had.

26:15.292 --> 26:21.318
I had the young lady that I met in Germany come over, and I married her here in Bryan, and we subsequently had a child.

26:21.978 --> 26:28.584
So for 90 cents an hour, I couldn't continue with a telephone company.

26:29.565 --> 26:36.291
And then in May of 1949, I started a career at A&M in the systems building.

26:36.271 --> 26:37.894
as a bookkeeper.

26:37.914 --> 26:38.234
Indeed.

26:38.335 --> 26:44.746
And not only that, people know you very well as also over at Kyle Field, been a ticket taker and head usher for some 50 years.

26:44.766 --> 26:45.928
We've only got about a minute left.

26:45.948 --> 26:46.990
That's a whole nother show.

26:47.410 --> 26:50.095
But a lot of people know you as that guy at Kyle Field for 50 years.

26:50.135 --> 26:50.917
That is correct.

26:51.057 --> 26:58.650
I have statewide, I have many, many friends that look for me when they come to Kyle Field to renew our acquaintance and

26:59.052 --> 27:02.596
tell me stories about their families and ask me about mine.

27:02.616 --> 27:02.917
Indeed.

27:03.357 --> 27:04.859
Frank Kocman, it's been a pleasure.

27:04.879 --> 27:12.308
We could do more and more shows about your service and about your service not only in World War II, but your service right here in the Brazos Valley.

27:12.328 --> 27:14.531
And we thank you for being our guest today.

27:14.611 --> 27:15.392
Appreciate it, Frank.

27:15.632 --> 27:16.994
Well, thank you for having me.

27:17.014 --> 27:17.374
All right.

27:17.615 --> 27:19.016
Absolutely.

27:19.036 --> 27:24.503
Frank Kocman was one of the fortunate soldiers who survived to celebrate VE Day.

27:24.787 --> 27:30.595
and eventually come home to Bryan and restart that precious youth that had been delayed by war.

27:30.835 --> 27:37.004
Many gave their lives to defend our country, and those who didn't gave away some of the best years of their lives.

27:37.024 --> 27:40.248
And for that, we should salute and thank them every day.

27:41.109 --> 27:43.653
For Frank Kocman, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:43.713 --> 27:46.677
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
