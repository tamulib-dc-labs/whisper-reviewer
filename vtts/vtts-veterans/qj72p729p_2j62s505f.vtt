00:19.792 --> 00:39.887
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.027 --> 00:41.209
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.915 --> 00:42.576
H.J.

00:42.656 --> 00:50.384
Marsh considers his timing quite fortunate, a 1945 high school graduate of Houston San Jacinto High School.

00:50.404 --> 00:54.028
By the time he joined the Army, World War II was just about over.

00:54.048 --> 00:57.251
But still he wanted to serve and the Army needed him in Korea.

00:57.992 --> 01:01.155
His unit served occupational duty in postwar Korea.

01:01.696 --> 01:10.285
While he says there was not much action at that time, his service was still valuable in keeping the peace that had been hard earned in the Pacific Theater.

01:10.889 --> 01:14.154
Korea, after all, was under Japanese rule during the war.

01:14.815 --> 01:20.545
And after the war, the split between North and South Korea was even more defined.

01:20.565 --> 01:21.506
Matter of fact, H.J.

01:21.546 --> 01:29.239
Marsh says it was then that he first heard the word communism during his service between World War II and the Korean War that started in 1950.

01:30.421 --> 01:31.402
Please welcome H.J.

01:31.463 --> 01:33.606
Marsh, a Bryan College Station resident

01:33.822 --> 01:36.287
for more than 60 years to Veterans of the Valley.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.349
You've been around a long time.

01:37.510 --> 01:39.875
Yes, I have.

01:39.895 --> 01:42.881
And you've seen a lot of changes in Bryan College Station in 60 years.

01:42.901 --> 01:43.162
Very much so.

01:43.182 --> 01:47.511
When I first came to Bryan, it was a two-lane blacktop right through town.

01:47.879 --> 01:50.783
And there's a lot of space between Bryan and College Station.

01:50.803 --> 01:51.244
Indeed.

01:51.264 --> 01:52.806
That was after your service in 1947.

01:52.826 --> 01:53.267
Yes, sir.

01:53.628 --> 01:54.509
And I want to get to that.

01:55.050 --> 02:05.425
But you were 17 years old when you joined the Army, and you made the decision to stay in high school because had you dropped out of high school, you probably would have been involved in the war, and you might not have ever gotten back to high school.

02:05.445 --> 02:06.166
That's correct.

02:06.267 --> 02:07.589
That's the reason I did it.

02:07.609 --> 02:10.613
And when I turned 18 is when

02:11.268 --> 02:13.931
Uncle Sam said, I want you.

02:15.032 --> 02:18.917
So I went to the induction center there in Houston.

02:19.017 --> 02:23.902
They said, go home, tell your mother goodbye, and be back here as quick as you can, because you're going.

02:23.962 --> 02:24.343
Yes, sir.

02:25.264 --> 02:26.265
And get your toothbrush.

02:26.285 --> 02:26.886
Yes, correct.

02:28.227 --> 02:33.613
You first had tried to get induction in the Navy, but you were colorblind.

02:33.914 --> 02:35.115
Correct.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.291
My daddy was in the Navy.

02:37.311 --> 02:39.133
And I wanted to go in the Navy too.

02:39.694 --> 02:43.357
My oldest son, by the way, he was a Vietnam veteran.

02:43.377 --> 02:43.657
Right.

02:43.838 --> 02:45.399
Gordon is his name?

02:45.419 --> 02:45.499
Yes.

02:45.519 --> 02:46.480
He was in the Navy.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.821
And he served on a carrier.

02:47.841 --> 02:48.222
Correct.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.163
In the Navy.

02:49.183 --> 02:49.483
Correct.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.444
I know you're very proud of that.

02:50.724 --> 02:51.785
Very proud.

02:51.885 --> 02:52.986
As all of your children.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.708
And we'll talk about them after a while too.

02:54.888 --> 02:55.108
Yes.

02:55.128 --> 03:01.714
But a 17-year-old and you're taken to Fort Sam Houston for induction, that's got to be your thoughts at the time.

03:01.774 --> 03:04.697
I mean, you're taken out of your comfort level, your comfort zone.

03:05.015 --> 03:06.698
And you're just being ordered around.

03:06.718 --> 03:08.962
What was that like for a 17-year-old kid?

03:08.982 --> 03:16.796
I was kind of like millions of other young kids, you know, never been away from home, didn't know what it was like, didn't know what you were going to get into.

03:17.978 --> 03:24.930
And it was a strange and scary situation, but, you know, they kept you so busy, you didn't have time to think too much.

03:25.331 --> 03:28.356
Right, yeah, because you were up early?

03:28.673 --> 03:29.454
You're doing drill?

03:29.875 --> 03:30.937
Yes, sir.

03:30.957 --> 03:33.401
You're learning how to be one of Uncle Sam's boys.

03:33.421 --> 03:33.821
Correct.

03:34.142 --> 03:34.843
Right.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.668
And you went to Little Rock for basic, is that right?

03:37.688 --> 03:37.908
Correct.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.571
Camp Robinson, Arkansas.

03:39.591 --> 03:40.052
Right.

03:40.072 --> 03:42.355
And then you finished your training in California?

03:42.375 --> 03:43.217
Correct.

03:43.237 --> 03:44.298
Fort Worth, California.

03:44.379 --> 03:46.262
Then they shipped me overseas.

03:47.624 --> 03:55.677
Well, when I was on that troop ship going west, I looked at the Golden Gate Bridge from the underneath.

03:56.281 --> 04:02.295
And I just thought to myself, Lord, I don't know whether I'll ever see that again, but let's go anyway.

04:02.315 --> 04:07.867
We got about three days out of Frisco, and they finally opened the order to tell us where we was going.

04:08.429 --> 04:09.952
And they said, we're going to Korea.

04:11.034 --> 04:13.480
And I said, where in the world is Korea?

04:14.067 --> 04:15.870
Never heard of it.

04:15.890 --> 04:16.191
Right.

04:16.211 --> 04:17.453
We found out where it was.

04:18.094 --> 04:22.261
Your high school geography didn't specifically talk about where you were.

04:22.281 --> 04:23.783
No, we didn't discuss that a whole lot.

04:23.803 --> 04:24.084
No, sir.

04:24.444 --> 04:27.189
How long did it take to get over there?

04:27.209 --> 04:28.671
About 17 days.

04:28.691 --> 04:29.553
We were on a troop ship.

04:29.573 --> 04:30.474
We were double loaded.

04:30.955 --> 04:31.135
Yeah.

04:32.558 --> 04:35.122
And spent a lot of time on deck.

04:36.945 --> 04:39.990
And taking a shower in salt water was funny.

04:41.135 --> 04:45.441
Oh, we did lose one of our troops for, he died of spinal meningitis.

04:45.982 --> 04:46.523
On the way over?

04:46.643 --> 04:50.088
Yeah, and we had to stop in Okinawa to take him off.

04:50.108 --> 04:50.709
Oh, how sad.

04:51.129 --> 04:51.850
Yeah.

04:51.870 --> 04:54.634
And then we continued on to Incheon, Korea.

04:55.115 --> 05:01.804
And you talked about Incheon, it had no wharf, so you got a little battle tested there, so to speak, because you had to climb the ropes up to it.

05:01.824 --> 05:03.767
Over the side, no landing nets, yes sir.

05:04.102 --> 05:33.805
yeah off the lst correct in the landing nets did you know how to do that had that been part of your training no no no it said get off this thing now and start climbing and when you get off you'll be in inchon that's correct yeah you wound up there at a replacement center and eventually near the 38th parallel talk about sort of where your permanent home was well we spent a little time in chin chin that was right on the 38th parallel and then our orders

05:34.527 --> 05:38.672
sent us to Wanju, which was a small outpost.

05:38.692 --> 05:41.214
I was in a motor pool.

05:42.876 --> 05:54.870
So I had a detachment of trucks and vehicles, and we did mostly liaison between the Koreans and the United States government.

05:55.630 --> 06:03.319
We had a lot of courier duty that we had to take parcels, packets to different other outposts.

06:03.839 --> 06:05.681
So it kept us busy.

06:05.742 --> 06:14.213
We didn't have too much time to think about how cold it was.

06:14.593 --> 06:20.962
Were you educated very much by your superiors about sort of what the world situation was then, post-World War II?

06:21.082 --> 06:23.065
Why did we have to be in Korea?

06:23.185 --> 06:28.993
What was happening up north with the Russians and the Communist Party starting to take hold?

06:29.053 --> 06:31.416
Did you kind of know what was going on?

06:31.818 --> 06:40.907
At the time, I guess, at 18 years old, you don't give too much thought to world politics and things like that.

06:40.947 --> 06:46.052
You just knew you was over there to do a job and get back home as quick as you could.

06:46.693 --> 06:49.475
So we didn't discuss politics a whole lot.

06:49.836 --> 07:00.306
But the South Koreans, who had probably not their own choice, but had still been under the arm of the Japanese during World War II, but they were friendly people.

07:00.556 --> 07:01.538
Yes, very friendly.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.104
We didn't have any problem at all with the South Koreans.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.671
In fact, they were real cooperative with us.

07:10.213 --> 07:12.037
We got along well together.

07:13.459 --> 07:15.603
I just felt sorry for them because they were so poor.

07:16.044 --> 07:16.605
Right.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.807
You talked about the children.

07:17.827 --> 07:18.088
Yeah.

07:18.468 --> 07:20.472
Poor little kids, you know, they starve.

07:21.717 --> 07:23.559
I told you about the dogs.

07:23.619 --> 07:26.162
I didn't see many dogs, but that's another.

07:27.043 --> 07:29.787
Well, no, but that was part of the world situation, right?

07:29.807 --> 07:29.987
Yes.

07:30.247 --> 07:32.991
You knew what a dog was in the United States.

07:33.051 --> 07:33.932
It was a pet.

07:33.952 --> 07:36.996
But in Korea, it was dinner.

07:37.016 --> 07:37.696
That's correct.

07:38.077 --> 07:43.624
And for a 17-year-old kid, you're just not, you can't really grasp that.

07:43.644 --> 07:46.928
I didn't comprehend that because I never had seen that before, you know.

07:48.490 --> 07:48.610
Right.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.492
The American people, Tom,

07:51.907 --> 07:57.274
A lot of us don't realize how fortunate we are to be an American.

07:57.294 --> 08:00.118
And it's something that I'm proud of.

08:01.199 --> 08:04.444
And I hope that everybody that lives in this country is proud.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.147
We've got a great country.

08:07.548 --> 08:08.329
Talk about your job.

08:08.369 --> 08:09.370
You're part of the motor pool.

08:09.411 --> 08:10.933
You had to go out on courier duty.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.134
Yes, sir.

08:12.154 --> 08:17.982
There was one time you mentioned that you had to go out and sort of on a rescue mission of another year.

08:18.383 --> 08:22.568
of another group that had broken down, and then you all broke down too, right?

08:22.589 --> 08:22.969
Correct.

08:24.671 --> 08:34.985
Over here, you know, 50 miles doesn't sound like very far, but over in a country like that, one-lane roads, mountains, no guardrails.

08:35.966 --> 08:38.069
Takes a long time to drive 50 miles.

08:38.329 --> 08:38.589
Right.

08:39.270 --> 08:39.811
But we did.

08:39.831 --> 08:46.360
We got about 50 miles up in the mountains, and our truck broke down, and it was cold.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.222
Oh, I've never been so cold in my life.

08:48.438 --> 08:49.740
This is the winter of 46, 47.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.122
Correct.

08:51.502 --> 08:52.223
And it was brutal.

08:52.243 --> 08:54.827
20, 30, below zero.

08:56.749 --> 09:00.174
I've never been that cold in my life and haven't been that cold since.

09:00.314 --> 09:00.575
Right.

09:01.636 --> 09:05.622
But we burned all the fuel that we had, all the liquid fuels.

09:06.823 --> 09:10.008
Finally, didn't have anything else to burn.

09:10.048 --> 09:11.610
Of course, everything was frozen, no wood.

09:11.630 --> 09:12.531
You couldn't get wood.

09:12.571 --> 09:16.757
So we just said, well, this might be it.

09:17.800 --> 09:31.253
But finally the motor officer, of course after we'd been gone for four or five hours, he decided to come look for us because he got a radiogram that the other truck was okay.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.921
And we should have been back.

09:32.981 --> 09:37.767
And anyway, he came up and picked us up and brought us back to camp.

09:38.468 --> 09:39.830
Thank goodness.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.492
You were glad to see him.

09:41.512 --> 09:42.413
Yeah, I could have hugged him.

09:44.415 --> 09:46.898
Because he was going to take you someplace where it was warm.

09:46.938 --> 09:47.379
Yes, sir.

09:47.819 --> 09:48.320
Right.

09:48.340 --> 09:56.089
You talked about it was so cold that there was one Jeep that was kept inside, and you used that Jeep to start all the other Jeeps.

09:56.109 --> 09:56.650
That's correct.

09:57.052 --> 10:00.877
The other jeeps wouldn't start because they were just so cold.

10:00.898 --> 10:01.298
Correct.

10:01.438 --> 10:05.324
And these are the jeeps that you needed to do your job as far as a courier and doing the other things.

10:05.344 --> 10:09.490
Well, jeeps, we had jeeps, weapons, carriers, six by sixes.

10:11.893 --> 10:13.696
And all the heavy.

10:14.437 --> 10:21.467
Of course, the 7th Division, which we were kind of attached to, the other ones that had the artillery and stuff.

10:21.707 --> 10:23.290
Right, right.

10:23.310 --> 10:26.434
I remember one time, one of the trucks was going down a hill.

10:27.325 --> 10:28.346
made a sharp turn.

10:28.366 --> 10:33.111
It was loaded with 75 caliber field artillery ammo.

10:33.752 --> 10:35.634
And it turned over.

10:35.654 --> 10:37.456
And those shells went flying every which way.

10:37.476 --> 10:43.021
And of course, we didn't know at the time that you have to have an arm and pin in a shell before it go off.

10:43.982 --> 10:49.208
But we were heading for the hills, trying to get away from them shells.

10:50.629 --> 10:52.691
But that was one of those deals.

10:52.731 --> 10:53.773
Those roads were awful.

10:53.793 --> 10:55.995
I mean, no guard rails or anything like that.

10:56.015 --> 10:57.096
I guess there were times you thought

10:57.734 --> 10:59.036
We got to go over the side or?

10:59.576 --> 11:07.006
And when we were up in the mountains and if we'd meet another Korean truck, we'd get as close as we could to the mountain.

11:07.307 --> 11:08.689
Right.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.852
And then we'd make them go around the outside.

11:11.072 --> 11:12.073
Right.

11:12.093 --> 11:23.849
And sometimes it wasn't but that much space, you know, between the wheels and the... And as I said, there's some of those cliffs that are 2,000 feet deep.

11:24.109 --> 11:25.711
Oh, my goodness.

11:25.731 --> 11:26.172
But...

11:26.590 --> 11:30.193
Now, to keep the motor pool going, sometimes you needed requisition supplies.

11:30.494 --> 11:31.374
Yes, we did.

11:33.016 --> 11:41.243
And if we couldn't get them, my motor officer told me, he said, Sergeant, get us a weapons carrier ready.

11:41.263 --> 11:45.427
We're going to Seoul, and we're going to do a requisition.

11:45.447 --> 11:46.488
I said, yes, sir.

11:46.508 --> 11:47.389
That's what we're going to do.

11:47.429 --> 11:49.671
He said, we're going to get them parts we have to have.

11:50.532 --> 11:56.057
We're going to wait till all them boys go to lunch, and we're going to go in there and requisition some parts.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.505
So that's what we did.

11:58.967 --> 12:04.874
And I hope the statute of limitations on theft of military equipment doesn't pass.

12:06.395 --> 12:10.920
Ladies and gentlemen, meet Radar O'Reilly, the original here.

12:12.021 --> 12:13.463
You got to do what you have to do.

12:15.065 --> 12:15.686
You had to.

12:16.006 --> 12:19.290
It was a matter of survival.

12:19.310 --> 12:21.152
Yes, we had to keep them trucks running.

12:21.172 --> 12:21.432
Right.

12:21.953 --> 12:25.116
You talked about one of the things that bothered you, though, was the poverty.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.924
just what they didn't have, the kids, the kids living in poverty.

12:29.544 --> 12:38.656
Even in mid-40s Houston, Texas, people had a home, had homes, had jobs, had food on the table.

12:38.676 --> 12:40.638
This is a totally different type of thing.

12:40.658 --> 12:42.480
I never had experienced it before.

12:42.981 --> 12:43.802
It really upset me.

12:43.822 --> 12:47.106
That sort of thing upset me worse than being over there.

12:47.366 --> 12:52.993
We used to take garbage out to the dump.

12:53.851 --> 12:56.534
and these little kids would see us coming.

12:56.554 --> 13:05.605
And we'd be kicking that garbage out the tailgate of the truck, and those little kids would pick up cans and scoop anything they could get out of those cans to eat it, you know.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.448
Right, right.

13:07.508 --> 13:15.077
Years and years after that, I'd get mad at somebody that left something on a plate and didn't eat it all.

13:15.097 --> 13:22.626
You said you weren't too aware of politics, but as we mentioned in the opening, it was the first time that you'd heard the word communism.

13:23.416 --> 13:30.204
And you knew that the people on the north side of the parallel were guided by the communists.

13:30.345 --> 13:30.825
That's correct.

13:30.845 --> 13:32.587
Dictated by the communists.

13:32.607 --> 13:34.610
And they'd come over to the south and cause some trouble.

13:34.830 --> 13:35.431
They would.

13:35.471 --> 13:35.972
Talk about that.

13:36.392 --> 13:40.177
They'd send raiding parties over there and try to steal.

13:40.197 --> 13:47.586
They'd hijack a truck every once in a while and steal whatever it was on its supplies.

13:47.846 --> 13:48.067
Right.

13:49.949 --> 13:50.389
Yeah.

13:50.409 --> 13:52.512
But we knew that the north was...

13:52.660 --> 13:55.744
bad guys, and they were communists, so communists had to be bad.

13:56.325 --> 13:56.646
Yeah.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.869
Talk about some of these courier trips.

13:58.889 --> 14:04.237
You touched on it earlier, but some of these trips, it would be 50 miles, they'd be six or seven hour ordeals, right?

14:05.078 --> 14:10.306
Because they're so rough roads, icy roads.

14:10.886 --> 14:12.789
Yeah.

14:12.809 --> 14:17.316
It's just hard to travel, especially in a big truck.

14:17.556 --> 14:22.363
Kang Nun Mountain, I think you said, was... 260-something curves in it.

14:23.170 --> 14:26.154
And it took a long time to get from top to bottom.

14:26.695 --> 14:27.155
In the wind?

14:29.459 --> 14:38.411
We were stuck at the top, the wind blowing 60 or 70 miles an hour and the snow chain got tangled up in the tie rod end of my little Jeep.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.715
And I had to get out and untangle it.

14:42.396 --> 14:47.043
And I had to hold onto the Jeep to keep from getting blown off the mountain.

14:47.764 --> 14:51.709
And there was a 2,000 foot drop and that was the only time I was a bit nervous.

14:52.010 --> 14:55.373
It makes me nervous just hearing that.

14:55.393 --> 15:00.898
We've got three or four pictures here I want you to see of young Sergeant Marsh.

15:01.118 --> 15:07.344
And I look at that picture and I think, I bet you didn't have any trouble getting the date.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.105
That's a good looking young soldier right there.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.969
That's right when you enlisted, when you were about 17 or 18.

15:13.629 --> 15:14.950
Let's see, I was a tech sergeant.

15:15.030 --> 15:20.295
I was probably about, with all of...

15:21.288 --> 15:23.071
Don't hold me to this fall of 46.

15:23.311 --> 15:27.098
I was, they call that a tech sergeant.

15:27.379 --> 15:31.245
Yeah, so you just turned 18 or something like that.

15:31.265 --> 15:31.345
T-5.

15:31.365 --> 15:31.466
Yeah.

15:31.966 --> 15:33.629
I was a T-5 back then.

15:34.411 --> 15:38.678
Now you're on the left, and that's a Bryan native on the right.

15:38.718 --> 15:38.959
Who is that?

15:38.979 --> 15:39.339
That's right.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.202
Joe Bartas.

15:42.044 --> 15:46.271
He was in the floor covering business here in Bryan.

15:46.532 --> 15:46.772
Right.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.603
He just done the part with us.

15:48.723 --> 15:50.327
He was a fine, good friend.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.678
He did a lot of work for me.

15:54.698 --> 15:58.307
We just had a good time together, you know, talking about old times.

15:59.029 --> 15:59.290
Right.

15:59.510 --> 16:00.272
Where was this taking?

16:00.438 --> 16:02.641
That's in Fort Ord, California.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.726
That's the old barracks we used to stay in back in the old days.

16:06.786 --> 16:14.015
That's you being lifted up by somebody you probably don't remember, right?

16:14.035 --> 16:15.116
I don't know what he was doing.

16:15.156 --> 16:17.059
He was about 45 years old.

16:17.079 --> 16:20.262
I don't know how he got in there, but anyway, volunteered.

16:21.384 --> 16:22.345
So there was some fun.

16:22.780 --> 16:23.361
Who's in this?

16:23.381 --> 16:23.982
You're on the left.

16:24.162 --> 16:25.144
Do you know who the other people are?

16:25.504 --> 16:26.105
I don't remember.

16:26.165 --> 16:32.836
One of them, the one at the bottom, I think his name was Klein, and the one with his shirt open, I forget what his name was.

16:33.216 --> 16:33.517
Right.

16:34.418 --> 16:35.560
Sixty-some years.

16:35.860 --> 16:39.907
Does things to your memory, Tom.

16:40.327 --> 16:41.088
Tell me about that.

16:41.108 --> 16:42.250
I know about that.

16:42.270 --> 16:42.691
Yes, sir.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.557
You came home in 1947.

16:46.998 --> 16:47.518
Correct.

16:47.779 --> 16:50.543
In the spring of 1947.

16:51.029 --> 16:53.893
before the Korean War had broken out in 1950.

16:54.854 --> 16:57.037
And coming back was an ordeal too.

16:57.297 --> 16:59.920
You were laid up for 11 days on the boat coming back, right?

16:59.940 --> 17:01.643
I was on sick bay.

17:02.464 --> 17:08.912
Well, I got a cold before my shipping date.

17:09.893 --> 17:15.861
And they told me that if you miss the ship, it might be six months before there's another ship to bring me home.

17:15.881 --> 17:17.583
And I knew I wouldn't go away six months.

17:18.645 --> 17:20.547
So I held on and

17:21.185 --> 17:22.987
Kept getting worse and worse and worse.

17:24.288 --> 17:29.853
So finally, in time to board the ship, and I made it aboard the ship.

17:29.873 --> 17:32.736
And as soon as I heard the props turning, I went to the sick call.

17:32.796 --> 17:37.820
And I was there 11 days with acute severe bronchitis.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.361
You came back.

17:38.401 --> 17:39.502
They wanted you to re-up.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.704
You said, no, you pretty much had your deal.

17:41.744 --> 17:44.406
And they said, well, we'll let you out tomorrow if you join the reserves.

17:44.426 --> 17:45.407
And this was April of 47.

17:45.667 --> 17:46.949
That's correct.

17:46.969 --> 17:48.610
And I said, I'll take that deal.

17:48.978 --> 17:50.220
Three-year hitch in the reserves.

17:50.380 --> 17:50.921
That's correct.

17:50.981 --> 17:52.763
And again, we talked about the timing of it all.

17:53.484 --> 17:58.952
Because April of 47, you were out in April of 50, and Korea started two months later.

17:58.972 --> 18:00.053
June of 50, that's correct.

18:00.073 --> 18:00.894
In June of 1950.

18:01.375 --> 18:05.060
So you missed World War II and you missed Korea.

18:05.080 --> 18:11.729
Yeah, I called them and asked them if my enlistment was still, I mean, my time in reserve was still active.

18:11.749 --> 18:14.633
And they said, no, you're done with us.

18:15.154 --> 18:15.735
We'll call you.

18:16.656 --> 18:18.038
We'll call you for need you.

18:18.058 --> 18:18.158
Okay.

18:18.408 --> 18:22.273
Well, you think back to your fortune as far as being able to survive that time.

18:24.075 --> 18:28.621
Had Truman not decided to drop the bomb, obviously World War II would have gone on longer.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.224
There would have been a ground war in Japan.

18:31.244 --> 18:43.960
A lot of people don't realize, Tom, at that time, the Japanese knew that if we ever invaded them, it was going to be to the last man.

18:44.378 --> 18:55.613
And in the summer of 1945, they were making plans for the Army and what they were going to do when they invaded Japan.

18:56.774 --> 19:03.202
And I was in that period, time period, that they knew that I was one of the ones that were going to go to Japan.

19:04.224 --> 19:09.350
And a lot of people don't realize that Harry Truman did a real great service.

19:10.051 --> 19:13.035
I mean, he killed a lot of Japanese and said, you know.

19:13.808 --> 19:16.351
but we would have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.514
Because those people were fanatics.

19:19.675 --> 19:28.045
You might remember during the Pacific campaign, we had to burn them out of those caves because they wouldn't come out.

19:29.787 --> 19:31.710
And that was their philosophy, fight to the death.

19:32.310 --> 19:36.255
We would have had a loss of life that was

19:37.805 --> 19:41.991
Well, let's say we lost 400 and some odd thousand killed in World War II.

19:42.211 --> 19:43.032
Right.

19:43.052 --> 19:43.733
There'd been another.

19:44.414 --> 19:45.195
Yeah.

19:45.235 --> 19:45.596
Who knows?

19:46.176 --> 19:46.877
Who knows how many?

19:46.937 --> 19:49.180
Most veterans I've talked to agree with that sentiment.

19:49.200 --> 19:49.961
Correct.

19:50.142 --> 19:50.682
Completely.

19:50.963 --> 19:51.343
Yes, sir.

19:51.363 --> 20:00.496
So you were out in April of, you were actually, you joined the reserves in April of 1947, and you decided to come to Bryan.

20:00.536 --> 20:05.162
You had a high school girlfriend that you wanted to, that was in Bryan at the time.

20:05.834 --> 20:09.921
And you and she were married and had two children and later divorced.

20:10.458 --> 20:13.883
But you came to Bryan and you went to work for the bank.

20:14.143 --> 20:16.226
Well, you went to A&M for a semester, right?

20:16.386 --> 20:17.768
One semester at A&M.

20:17.788 --> 20:18.869
So I'm a former student.

20:18.889 --> 20:19.810
You are a former student.

20:19.870 --> 20:20.992
One semester at A&M.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.397
Got expensive to go to school at that time.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.660
So you decided to get out and go to work.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.323
And you worked for eight years for First National Bank.

20:29.503 --> 20:30.565
First National Bank.

20:31.186 --> 20:31.566
Yes, sir.

20:31.766 --> 20:32.047
Right.

20:32.387 --> 20:33.489
And you met Gladys.

20:33.509 --> 20:34.330
That's correct.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.271
At First National Bank.

20:35.291 --> 20:35.912
That's correct.

20:35.932 --> 20:37.514
1956, you married Gladys.

20:37.694 --> 20:38.355
That's correct.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.956
Been married ever since.

20:40.117 --> 20:40.918
Been married ever since.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.040
53 of them.

20:43.681 --> 20:45.984
She's part of every success that you have, right?

20:46.305 --> 20:48.948
If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here.

20:49.489 --> 20:51.511
Talk about your time in Bryant College Station.

20:51.531 --> 20:52.733
I mean, over 60 years.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.035
And you're a salesman.

20:54.195 --> 20:57.259
You sold insurance for Prudential, I believe.

20:57.279 --> 20:59.562
I retired from the Prudential Insurance Company.

20:59.582 --> 20:59.822
Right.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.106
You went out on your own, sold some insurance, sold some real estate.

21:03.787 --> 21:06.751
So you met a lot of people in Bryant College Station.

21:06.791 --> 21:08.173
You know a lot of the history and the

21:08.592 --> 21:10.275
and the old families of Bryan College Station.

21:10.475 --> 21:15.723
I have been really fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet the people that I have.

21:16.925 --> 21:22.834
One is Travis Bryan Jr., one of the finest Christians, finest men I ever met.

21:24.798 --> 21:29.004
And of course he is today one of my best friends.

21:29.144 --> 21:29.505
Indeed.

21:30.487 --> 21:33.992
Then I met William Dudley Fitch.

21:34.732 --> 21:35.653
The Lake Mr. Pitch.

21:35.834 --> 21:38.598
I had the pleasure of meeting him on a couple of occasions also.

21:38.638 --> 21:39.038
Yes, sir.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.864
I was out in his house one afternoon.

21:43.625 --> 21:52.638
See, back in the early 60s, this was 1960 or 61, Glade Street ended right there at Southwest Parkway.

21:53.820 --> 21:57.705
And he said, H.J., you got a minute?

21:57.725 --> 22:00.189
I said, yes, sir, I got a minute for you, Bill.

22:00.249 --> 22:01.551
He said, let's get in a drink.

22:01.591 --> 22:02.292
I want to show you something.

22:02.778 --> 22:06.482
So we went back across the field and pointed out there and he said, see over there?

22:07.583 --> 22:13.008
He said, I gave the city of College Station the land to build a new house.

22:13.688 --> 22:14.649
And that's where it's going to be.

22:15.310 --> 22:16.251
Right out there in the country.

22:16.371 --> 22:17.612
And that's where it is today.

22:17.872 --> 22:18.573
2818.

22:18.593 --> 22:25.319
Of course, he was a brilliant, brilliant individual.

22:28.022 --> 22:30.304
He had foresight to

22:32.174 --> 22:36.259
look into the future and tell what it was going to be.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.045
And he developed the major parts of College Station during his lifetime.

22:41.385 --> 22:42.747
Right, right.

22:42.947 --> 22:44.709
And with the help of Travis Bryant.

22:46.712 --> 22:48.774
A lot of the great families and the great names.

22:48.814 --> 22:49.635
Yes.

22:49.655 --> 22:50.617
You've seen a lot of changes.

22:50.657 --> 22:55.403
I think you said you and Gladys lived in about 15 houses in Bryant College Station.

22:55.423 --> 22:58.266
Well, I used to, yeah, we had wheels on all our furniture.

22:58.482 --> 23:23.747
I was a swapper and a trader, and I liked to... I met Bill Scaster was another friend, and I had a long association with him, and he and I worked some business deals together, house deals and things like that, so that was one of the reasons I hadn't bought and sold so many houses.

23:24.503 --> 23:28.629
Now you say you had two sons and two daughters, right?

23:28.649 --> 23:28.829
Correct.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.091
Two sons and two daughters.

23:30.171 --> 23:30.511
Correct.

23:30.551 --> 23:31.813
You and Gladys had two daughters.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.376
Your two sons were both in the framing contracting business.

23:34.396 --> 23:34.997
That's correct.

23:35.017 --> 23:36.740
One in Fort Worth, one in Georgia.

23:37.040 --> 23:43.108
My son David is in Fort Worth and Gordon lives in Gainesville, Georgia.

23:43.309 --> 23:43.609
Right.

23:43.994 --> 23:45.056
And he's a Vietnam veteran.

23:45.256 --> 23:46.639
He's a Vietnam veteran.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.460
Right, right.

23:47.540 --> 23:49.483
He served, I guess, off the coast on a carrier.

23:49.644 --> 23:50.145
Is that right?

23:50.205 --> 23:53.090
Yes, he's also a life member of our post.

23:53.110 --> 23:54.853
Right.

23:54.873 --> 23:56.095
What was his job in the Navy?

23:56.115 --> 23:57.417
I mean, he served on the carrier.

23:57.457 --> 23:58.539
Was he a flyer?

23:58.619 --> 24:00.963
He was a records keeper.

24:01.284 --> 24:01.584
I see.

24:03.087 --> 24:06.733
Maintenance records and different things like records.

24:07.554 --> 24:08.336
He wasn't a pilot.

24:08.356 --> 24:09.698
He wasn't a...

24:10.150 --> 24:12.313
Yeah, but he served on the carrier during Vietnam.

24:12.593 --> 24:13.434
Yes, he did.

24:13.454 --> 24:14.576
So he's a veteran.

24:15.297 --> 24:21.324
I think Gladys reminded us correctly that you all have six grandchildren and one great-grandchild on the way.

24:21.404 --> 24:21.985
Is that right?

24:22.105 --> 24:24.348
I think that's the number.

24:26.631 --> 24:31.097
We were kind of bantering about a number sort of back and forth, and I think we came up with six.

24:31.597 --> 24:35.202
And you've got a grandchild that's on the way, a great-grandchild.

24:36.664 --> 24:39.027
Her arrival date is about November.

24:39.547 --> 24:40.268
About November.

24:40.468 --> 24:41.029
Yes, sir.

24:41.049 --> 24:42.992
Yeah, yeah.

24:43.012 --> 24:53.748
So Bryan College Station, I can't conceive of some 61, 62 years in this town and really sort of just the changes you've seen.

24:53.868 --> 24:57.934
I mean, we've had the revitalization lately of downtown Bryan.

24:57.954 --> 25:01.960
I guess you could remember downtown Bryan when the streets were there, but all the stores were there.

25:01.980 --> 25:06.867
I remember downtown Bryan when the old Charles Hotel was there.

25:07.228 --> 25:07.528
Yeah.

25:07.627 --> 25:13.536
the old LaSalle, and then there's a lot of small little store, Lester's, Beverly Braley's.

25:14.918 --> 25:15.679
Edges.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.162
Yeah.

25:20.806 --> 25:22.108
This is many of them.

25:22.128 --> 25:24.952
Of course, my memory's not as good as it used to be either.

25:24.972 --> 25:26.575
Right, right.

25:26.595 --> 25:31.963
But you sold up until about five years ago, right, when you were sort of taking it easy from there?

25:32.043 --> 25:35.608
Yes, I finally decided that I'd let somebody else...

25:36.145 --> 25:38.909
and do the selling job and watch them.

25:39.330 --> 25:43.857
One of your involvements is with the local VFW 4692 with the VFW.

25:44.197 --> 25:47.042
I know you enjoy your involvement with that and those people.

25:47.062 --> 25:48.384
I always try to stay active.

25:50.227 --> 25:53.372
I've helped them in a lot of projects.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.395
I've helped them do a lot of things.

25:55.515 --> 26:00.122
I've always volunteered to work whatever it was that needed working.

26:01.705 --> 26:04.549
So we've got a good organization

26:05.457 --> 26:21.296
I think that a lot of members, a lot of people that are veterans of foreign wars that are not members of our post, and I strongly urge them to come out and apply because we need to.

26:21.316 --> 26:34.232
Well, we've talked about that because there's another generation coming up that needs to keep the VFW and the memories of the veterans who served in foreign wars and all veterans, whether it's VFW, American Legion, whatever.

26:34.887 --> 26:40.874
They need to come up because the Vietnam veterans and the Desert Storm veterans, they need to get involved.

26:41.014 --> 26:42.896
Iraq and Afghanistan.

26:43.337 --> 26:43.597
Sure.

26:45.099 --> 26:52.448
There's a lot to be offered, you know, to be a... It's a pride of being a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.150
Indeed.

26:54.170 --> 27:02.219
Well, we thank you for your service, and we're glad that you did what you did, and it was an important, important service for our country.

27:02.239 --> 27:04.742
Well, I always, like I said,

27:05.043 --> 27:10.401
I tried to do the best I could, and whatever they said, well, let's do it.

27:10.421 --> 27:11.023
You did your job.

27:11.043 --> 27:12.748
Let's do it the best way we can know how.

27:13.029 --> 27:13.651
H.J., thank you.

27:13.672 --> 27:13.832
You bet.

27:13.852 --> 27:14.434
It's been a pleasure.

27:14.615 --> 27:15.036
Yes, sir.

27:15.623 --> 27:28.938
Our country has been served not just by those who went in harm's way, but by those who, through their volunteering to serve, stood ready at all times, did their jobs in uniform, and then came home to serve their family and their community.

27:29.279 --> 27:31.081
And we salute Sergeant H.J.

27:31.101 --> 27:32.522
Marsh for his such service.

27:33.163 --> 27:34.144
I'm Tom Turberville.

27:34.164 --> 27:37.328
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
