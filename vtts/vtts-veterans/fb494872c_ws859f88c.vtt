WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:21.448
Thank you.

00:28.718 --> 00:31.444
Thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.186 --> 00:35.173
He grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, knowing he wanted to be a soldier.

00:35.715 --> 00:43.032
He tried to enlist at the ripe old age of 15, even raised money to help the British fight off the Germans in World War II.

00:43.383 --> 00:50.959
Although he graduated from Texas A&M in 1950, his military service began in 1947 when he enlisted in the U.S.

00:51.100 --> 00:51.721
Navy Reserve.

00:52.322 --> 00:55.409
He retired from active duty on 31 August 1982.

00:55.429 --> 01:00.700
An end between those dates is a military career that took him to Germany.

01:00.680 --> 01:17.602
Fort Hood, Texas, four separate times, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Korea, Vietnam, the Army War College in Pennsylvania, Germany, just to name a few, and finally full circle back to Texas A&M where he served as Commandant of the Corps until his retirement in 1982.

01:18.743 --> 01:23.369
Veterans of the Valley welcomes retired Colonel James R. Woodall to today's show.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.472
Mr. Woodall, thank you for being here.

01:26.380 --> 01:31.087
Briefly, give us a rundown of your military career once you left A&M.

01:31.628 --> 01:36.194
Well, when I graduated from A&M, I had a regular army commission, but I wasn't 21.

01:36.274 --> 01:45.788
So I had to had to wait a couple of months before I went in and I went to Fort Hood and then to Germany with the second armored division.

01:45.808 --> 01:52.438
And from Germany, I came back to Fort Hood, the fourth armored division, and then I got out of the army for a while.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.362
and decided to go back in and finally got back in in 1960.

01:58.504 --> 02:05.158
Fort Benning, 2nd Infantry Division, then to Korea, the 1st Cav Division up on the DMZ.

02:05.639 --> 02:06.701
You were there for about a year, right?

02:06.821 --> 02:08.024
I was 13 months.

02:09.166 --> 02:13.735
And then back to the States, 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood again.

02:14.373 --> 02:17.178
then to Leavenworth, Kansas, Washington, D.C.

02:18.079 --> 02:19.942
And I finally got out of Washington, D.C.

02:19.982 --> 02:27.474
after two years and went to Vietnam where I was in the 1st Battalion of the 50th Infantry.

02:27.534 --> 02:32.022
It was a mechanized battalion attached to the 173rd Airborne.

02:32.042 --> 02:40.836
I was executive officer for five months and then I was a battalion commander for six months, a little over six months.

02:42.571 --> 02:49.340
There was a battalion commander relieved in the 173rd Airborne, and so the general sent me over to this other battalion.

02:49.661 --> 02:51.743
You actually thought you were going to get to come home a little early.

02:51.783 --> 02:52.905
Yeah, I was getting ready to come home.

02:53.045 --> 02:55.008
I was packing to come home.

02:55.028 --> 03:05.001
So I went over to the Airborne Battalion for a while, and finally someone came in from the States, an Airborne Lieutenant Colonel, and took over the battalion.

03:06.143 --> 03:11.430
So I came back to the States and came back to Fort Hood again.

03:12.338 --> 03:18.166
And from Fort Hood, I went to Army War College and from there over to Germany and stayed in Germany for five years.

03:19.367 --> 03:25.716
And I kept extending in Germany because Tom Parsons, the commandant here at A&M, kept extending.

03:25.776 --> 03:30.422
And I wanted the job, so he would extend, so I would extend, and he'd extend, and I'd extend.

03:30.442 --> 03:31.964
If you had to extend, at least you were in Germany.

03:32.205 --> 03:33.026
Well, that's right.

03:33.326 --> 03:34.468
That's a nice place to be.

03:34.588 --> 03:39.274
So I stayed there five years and finally got the assignment as Commandant of Cadets.

03:39.743 --> 03:41.565
and came back and I spent five years.

03:41.825 --> 03:44.768
Actually, I was the professor of military science, the PMS.

03:45.649 --> 03:51.374
And at that time, the ranking army officer was the commandant of cadets.

03:51.454 --> 03:52.475
So that's how I got to be.

03:52.535 --> 03:53.957
So I wore two hats, actually.

03:54.457 --> 03:54.577
Right.

03:55.879 --> 03:56.700
And then I retired.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.681
And then you retired after all that.

03:59.943 --> 04:06.409
Let's back up to Korea, I guess, is when you really saw your first action as a soldier.

04:06.929 --> 04:09.071
Some people call it a baptism of fire.

04:10.212 --> 04:13.055
To me, it's more like a sprinkle.

04:13.896 --> 04:21.463
But we had some action against the North Koreans on the DMZ, and they'd come across.

04:21.604 --> 04:24.967
We'd usually have three or four firefights a month.

04:25.047 --> 04:25.968
What year was this?

04:25.988 --> 04:27.029
This was in 1962 and 63.

04:27.089 --> 04:27.730
62, 63.

04:28.390 --> 04:35.097
So they'd come across the DMZ, and we'd have ambushes, and we'd try to ambush them.

04:36.595 --> 04:44.524
They ambushed one of our trucks and they killed, I can't remember, three or four people from the ninth cab, which was actually operated in the DMZ.

04:44.624 --> 04:46.767
We operated just south of the DMZ.

04:47.367 --> 04:52.813
So we put out some pretty strong ambushes every night, a number of ambushes.

04:52.873 --> 04:58.159
And the ambush I was leading one night, but we got contact with the North Koreans.

04:59.281 --> 05:03.145
Was that a regular type thing or was it pretty much a hit and miss as far as when you would go out at night?

05:03.165 --> 05:04.847
Did you have good, solid,

05:05.198 --> 05:31.206
evidence that they were there was it just let's go out and see if we can dig them up they were always there they were always there and of course one thing we were trying to do is is prevent line crossers because there were spies going north and south all the time trying to catch those people uh but uh there was a lot of activity about a 10-day period uh we had we had some pretty good firefights along the dmz any any any particular firefight that you really remember that sticks out

05:31.709 --> 05:33.811
Well, the one that I was the patrol leader on.

05:33.831 --> 05:37.616
Of course, I wasn't supposed to be out there because I was the battle group S-1, you know.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.398
I was a rear echelon guy.

05:40.219 --> 05:41.460
Well, how did you end up at the front?

05:42.582 --> 05:44.584
Well, I just volunteered.

05:44.624 --> 05:50.231
And I got me a, put together a patrol and took them out.

05:50.251 --> 05:54.396
I think there were about 12 of us, but it was a nice little action.

05:54.416 --> 05:59.121
I had one man that got hit, but I think he was hit with our own grenade, you know.

05:59.882 --> 06:01.564
We were throwing grenades a little bit.

06:02.337 --> 06:06.461
And he got hit in the face and I pulled the thing out of his face and told me he's all right.

06:07.082 --> 06:08.123
Slapped the bandage on it.

06:08.884 --> 06:09.604
And you went on your way.

06:09.644 --> 06:11.446
Continued on.

06:11.466 --> 06:13.688
Anything else about Korea that really stands out?

06:13.769 --> 06:16.411
Well, it was a very long tour.

06:16.471 --> 06:23.679
It seemed like it was years, but and it was it was kind of a depressing place to serve.

06:23.699 --> 06:24.539
What was the weather like there?

06:25.360 --> 06:29.344
Well, it was hot in the summer and in the winter it was so cold.

06:29.905 --> 06:32.007
It was really miserable in the winter.

06:32.780 --> 06:34.963
What was the average day like?

06:36.005 --> 06:41.753
Did you go out on patrol every single day or would there be a, you know, a stand down day type thing?

06:41.773 --> 06:46.761
Well, I didn't go out on patrol except when I volunteered because I was pushing papers in the headquarters.

06:46.841 --> 06:54.933
But we had one company each night that was on, we call it stakeout, ambush patrols along the DMZ.

06:55.534 --> 06:57.537
And the rest of the time, the units were just training.

06:58.158 --> 06:58.298
Mm-hmm.

06:59.847 --> 07:02.690
Okay, so after Korea, where to?

07:03.051 --> 07:04.272
Well, I came back to Fort Hood.

07:04.292 --> 07:07.856
You came back to Fort Hood again, and what duties did you handle there at Fort Hood?

07:07.876 --> 07:13.362
I was the assistant G1 in the division headquarters of the 2nd Armory Division.

07:14.243 --> 07:21.831
And I got back, and I was immediately told that the 2nd Armory Division would go into Germany for a maneuver.

07:22.432 --> 07:23.754
They call it Operation Big Lift.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.956
So my wife was not too happy with it.

07:26.307 --> 07:32.176
I just unpacked my bags and I said, hey, I got to pack again because I'm gone.

07:32.256 --> 07:39.686
And so a few weeks after I got back to Korea, I was in Germany and we went over there and stayed about a month or six weeks.

07:40.207 --> 07:40.327
Okay.

07:40.347 --> 07:40.908
What was that like?

07:41.669 --> 07:42.711
What part of Germany was that in?

07:42.891 --> 07:50.442
Well, that was along the Rhine River and then in the what they call the Oldenbaal, which is near Heidelberg up in the mountains there.

07:50.759 --> 07:56.488
And it was the area where I had maneuvered in when I was over there the first time, so I knew all the... You already knew pretty much the area.

07:56.528 --> 07:57.890
I knew the terrain, yeah.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.171
Okay.

07:59.232 --> 08:01.115
I was glad to get back to Germany after.

08:01.616 --> 08:06.524
And all I could say is somebody sold a lot of automobiles since 1954 when I left.

08:09.047 --> 08:10.410
Okay, let's talk about Vietnam.

08:10.450 --> 08:13.955
When did you first find out that you were going to be going to Vietnam?

08:13.975 --> 08:14.556
Well...

08:15.262 --> 08:18.706
I kept thinking I was going to Vietnam, but they kept assigning me somewhere else.

08:18.827 --> 08:29.821
And then finally, when I got to Washington, D.C., they said I had to stay there two years because I thought out of the Commandant General Staff College, surely I would go to Vietnam, but I was sent to Washington.

08:29.881 --> 08:36.109
So after I got up there, I checked with the personnel of people, and they said, no, you've got to stay here two years.

08:37.010 --> 08:43.979
So I said, okay, I want to go in the summer of 1968, mid-summer 1968, and I'm going to go to the 1st Cav Division.

08:44.360 --> 08:44.560
Right.

08:45.113 --> 08:47.036
And that almost worked out for you, or you thought it was working out?

08:47.056 --> 08:47.797
Well, I got my orders.

08:48.057 --> 08:49.840
July 15th, 1st Cav Division.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.082
That's exactly what I wanted.

08:51.542 --> 08:58.733
And when I got to Cam'ron Bay in Vietnam, they said, check the bulletin board every day and see your assignment.

08:59.374 --> 09:01.016
Well, I thought, you know, why?

09:01.417 --> 09:02.238
I've got an assignment.

09:02.258 --> 09:03.299
I don't need to check the bulletin board.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.081
You knew where you were going, right?

09:04.101 --> 09:05.963
But I checked the bulletin board anyway.

09:05.983 --> 09:09.048
And after about two or three days, it said 173rd Airborne.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.530
It was a shock to me.

09:11.287 --> 09:16.373
I was airborne qualified, but I really wanted to be in the first cab.

09:16.393 --> 09:26.044
So I reported up to the 173rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and spent the night there.

09:26.124 --> 09:32.552
And the first night, somebody started shooting at us, and I thought, I think I'm in the war now.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.053
The next day, I flew down on a helicopter.

09:36.093 --> 09:44.422
The battalion commander picked me up on his helicopter, flew me down to, they call it LZ Uplift, which was just a big dome area, no grass.

09:44.482 --> 09:51.490
It was all red dirt, surrounded by mountains, and you could see smoke coming up all over the place.

09:52.110 --> 09:53.792
Explain what LZ is.

09:53.852 --> 09:54.713
A landing zone.

09:54.733 --> 09:55.694
A landing zone.

09:55.774 --> 09:58.157
It was a base camp, is what it was.

09:59.038 --> 10:03.062
So I flew in there, and I thought, that looks just like Din Ben Poo.

10:03.042 --> 10:08.190
or what I knew of Dinh Binh Phu, where the French were defeated in Vietnam.

10:08.211 --> 10:08.431
Right.

10:08.471 --> 10:08.731
54.

10:09.893 --> 10:16.063
And I knew it wasn't Dinh Binh Phu, but I thought it was weird because hills all around and everything.

10:16.104 --> 10:16.725
So I landed.

10:17.506 --> 10:21.993
I looked up, and the first thing I saw was there was a tent with a French flag.

10:22.013 --> 10:22.414
My goodness.

10:22.714 --> 10:24.898
I thought, well, I'm in the twilight zone.

10:25.435 --> 10:31.503
But it turned out to be an Iowa state flag, and that's just a reverse of a French flag.

10:31.523 --> 10:35.629
So I was glad to know that I wasn't in the twilight zone.

10:36.410 --> 10:42.117
But I was the battalion executive officer in the battalion, the first of the 50th.

10:43.659 --> 10:47.344
We were on the coast of the South China Sea.

10:47.965 --> 10:50.549
We call it the Bansang Plains.

10:50.569 --> 10:53.012
And the enemy in that area was mostly VCs.

10:53.752 --> 10:54.433
Viet Cong.

10:54.453 --> 10:55.594
Viet Cong.

10:55.614 --> 11:09.952
And I'd been there about two months when we were ordered to go back, or not to go back, but to be transferred to the Central Highlands near An Cay, Camp Radcliffe.

11:09.972 --> 11:12.695
And our primary mission there was securing the highway.

11:12.715 --> 11:13.697
That was the first mission.

11:13.737 --> 11:17.081
The second mission was to conduct operations in the local area.

11:18.002 --> 11:22.948
And we had the highway between An Cay Pass and the Manyang Pass, Highway 19.

11:23.553 --> 11:27.100
And we had to keep two companies on the highway.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.124
We had two fire bases.

11:29.144 --> 11:35.377
And we put out strong points every day.

11:35.818 --> 11:36.780
There were a number of bridges.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.624
We had to guard the bridges.

11:38.644 --> 11:44.616
And then we always had one company operating off the highway out in the boonies.

11:45.406 --> 11:48.891
We normally had a Mike strike force attached to us.

11:48.932 --> 11:54.200
That's a Montagnard soldiers commanded by special forces.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.644
A lot of the viewers may not know what the Montagnards are.

11:56.664 --> 12:01.672
Okay, the Montagnards were the hill tribes of... They were more or less the indigenous peoples.

12:01.872 --> 12:03.014
The indigenous peoples.

12:03.074 --> 12:05.077
They were the Indians of Vietnam.

12:05.157 --> 12:05.438
Okay.

12:06.119 --> 12:10.165
But they were fairly primitive people, but a beautiful people.

12:10.803 --> 12:14.467
And did you find them to be a really big help to to your endeavors?

12:14.727 --> 12:18.932
Well, you know, having an extra battalion attached to you was a big help.

12:18.992 --> 12:23.136
And we we were their purpose was to keep the N.V.A.

12:23.296 --> 12:27.040
off guard so they wouldn't come up and and strike the highway.

12:28.202 --> 12:28.342
Mm hmm.

12:28.362 --> 12:30.544
So they they served their purpose.

12:30.825 --> 12:31.585
They did.

12:31.605 --> 12:33.567
Did you did the American forces get along with them?

12:33.848 --> 12:34.288
Oh, yeah.

12:34.308 --> 12:34.809
Well, they were.

12:35.349 --> 12:37.772
Well, you know, they'd come in and

12:38.090 --> 12:40.893
spend the night, then they'd go out in the field and stay 30 days.

12:41.314 --> 12:42.375
So we wouldn't see them.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.759
Well, I'd see them because I'd go out every once in a while and visit.

12:45.779 --> 12:47.101
But they were.

12:47.902 --> 12:51.746
They would literally go out for 30 days and literally live off the land there in the jungle.

12:51.766 --> 12:52.227
That's right.

12:52.267 --> 12:53.708
Yeah.

12:53.728 --> 13:00.216
So we had one, well, actually two incidents with the Montagnards that were pretty sad.

13:01.023 --> 13:05.689
Tiger got into one of their night perimeters and grabbed one of the guys and drug him off in the jungle.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.471
And the next morning they found him half eaten.

13:08.472 --> 13:12.137
And in the same area the next month, same thing happened.

13:12.157 --> 13:14.460
Tiger got in, grabbed one of these mountain yards.

13:14.480 --> 13:20.287
You know, the little people, 100 pounds or so, 90, but very small.

13:20.627 --> 13:23.211
And so we lost two soldiers that way.

13:23.591 --> 13:25.113
Now, our soldiers were pretty spooky.

13:26.094 --> 13:28.677
They got kind of spooked after hearing that story.

13:28.697 --> 13:30.760
So the people were alert at night.

13:31.567 --> 13:43.386
And about two months later, after these incidents, the Montagnards, the local Montagnard people living in the Montagnard villages, they came out of the jungle carrying a tiger.

13:43.406 --> 13:47.332
And we were convinced that that was the, we called him the man-eater of Anke.

13:47.973 --> 13:50.598
We were convinced that they'd killed the man-eater of Anke.

13:50.658 --> 13:55.626
And the story I was told, that the Montagnards killed him with a crossbow.

13:56.287 --> 13:56.427
Mm-hmm.

13:56.609 --> 14:06.241
And just a few months ago, I was contacting one of my former company commanders about that story.

14:06.261 --> 14:09.225
And he said, no, they didn't kill him with the crossbow.

14:09.245 --> 14:11.508
They poisoned him.

14:11.528 --> 14:14.291
He said, I know because I tried to buy the skin.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.813
They wanted $500 for it.

14:16.114 --> 14:17.035
And I was about to pay it.

14:17.055 --> 14:20.019
But then I decided, well, what am I going to do with tiger skin?

14:20.039 --> 14:22.121
How am I going to get it treated properly?

14:22.522 --> 14:24.204
And how am I going to get it back to the state?

14:24.244 --> 14:25.806
So he passed that up.

14:26.056 --> 14:29.561
They did kill the man-eater.

14:29.681 --> 14:30.923
So that was great.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.648
What was the other... Did you have another Montagnard story?

14:34.668 --> 14:35.829
I think you said there were two of them.

14:36.470 --> 14:39.775
No, there were two people eaten by a tiger.

14:40.235 --> 14:40.516
Okay.

14:40.936 --> 14:43.700
What were some other events that you can remember that happened there?

14:44.241 --> 14:50.870
Well, one of the... In Camp Radcliffe, it was a very large camp.

14:50.930 --> 14:52.692
It used to be the base camp of the first camp.

14:52.732 --> 14:54.915
Tremendous...

14:55.435 --> 14:57.621
and not too many people in there.

14:57.861 --> 15:02.974
Right at one edge of it, there was this tall Sugarloaf Mountain.

15:02.995 --> 15:05.501
It was called Hong Kong Mountain.

15:05.521 --> 15:07.787
And we had a signal installation up on top of this thing.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.333
I don't know how, a thousand feet or something.

15:10.354 --> 15:12.499
And we had snipers.

15:12.665 --> 15:18.632
The entire time I was there, we had snipers on that mountain shooting down into the, there was a hospital there.

15:18.692 --> 15:22.837
They shoot into the hospital and they shoot into supply areas and things like that.

15:22.858 --> 15:23.458
And we never did.

15:23.478 --> 15:30.287
I put, in fact, I put a Montagnard battalion, one of those Mike's strike forces, up there for three days trying to catch those snipers.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.650
And we never did get them.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.751
I thought that was pretty weird.

15:33.791 --> 15:39.798
We got people inside the wire, you know, permanently.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.220
I guess the...

15:42.061 --> 15:53.355
The thing I remember most was on February the 14th, Valentine's Day, we had a big ambush, and it was in an area where we hadn't had an ambush before.

15:53.815 --> 16:02.466
They always hit us to the west of Anke, but we never did have anything go on to the east, and they pulled off a major ambush on a convoy.

16:03.104 --> 16:05.267
And we only had a bridge out there.

16:05.607 --> 16:07.169
Very few of our troops were there.

16:07.189 --> 16:08.691
We had two bridges, I think.

16:09.052 --> 16:13.277
We just had enough people to guard the bridge, but we had no regular forces out there.

16:13.357 --> 16:27.676
So they hit the convoy pretty hard, and that was really one of the actions I got deeply involved in because I just happened to be in my Jeep leaving the gate of Camp Radcliffe.

16:27.716 --> 16:29.538
I normally would fly in my helicopter.

16:29.558 --> 16:33.043
I had a Charlie Charlie command and control helicopter every day.

16:33.192 --> 16:37.618
I would normally fly in that, but that day, for some reason, I decided, well, I'm going to go in my Jeep.

16:38.179 --> 16:39.841
It was a nice day, so you decided to stay on the ground.

16:39.861 --> 17:02.372
Drive up and down the highway, and just as I left the gate, I heard the explosions, and then on the radio, they said this convoy had been hit, so I dashed out there, and immediately I started getting the trucks that were not in the actual kill zone, making those guys move out and clear the area, and then

17:03.331 --> 17:14.888
spotted some NVA, and I got my driver, my artillery officer, and we went over and we assaulted these NVA, and after that, and we eliminated them.

17:14.908 --> 17:18.032
Did you have any idea what kind of force you were up against at that time?

17:18.533 --> 17:23.280
Well, we figured it was probably at least a company of North Vietnamese.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.302
And a company would be how many?

17:25.183 --> 17:32.173
Well, the North Vietnamese, it might be 60, 75, because they're usually under strength.

17:32.575 --> 17:34.780
helped eliminate a lot of them.

17:34.800 --> 17:41.155
But anyway, after that was over, my driver told me, he said, sir, you're going to get me killed.

17:41.175 --> 17:43.381
I said, no, Johnson, I'm going to send you home a hero.

17:43.461 --> 17:43.942
And I did.

17:44.523 --> 17:47.310
He was getting pretty sharp then, but I sent him home.

17:47.493 --> 18:16.470
made it all right but he he didn't really care for that uh little escapade okay i'm sorry go ahead and you didn't you end up sending your uh your xo or so forth back to the to the rear well in this that day they hit us on the other other side there was another ambush another contact on the other to the west of this is that the first time that it ever happened you know before usually we'd have we'd have a contact and that would be it that would be it but they hit us here with a major ambush then they hit us

18:16.872 --> 18:19.337
at the other end of the area of operations.

18:19.838 --> 18:21.481
Trying to do an end-to-round on you, more or less.

18:21.501 --> 18:35.590
So I told my executive officer after that, I said, anytime we get a contact, if it's in the west, you're just going out to the eastern part of the sector, or if it's in the east, you go to the west, and then you can just assume command of that area, because we're talking about a

18:35.570 --> 18:39.182
20 mile, 20 mile stretch there.

18:39.343 --> 18:40.988
As far as a convoy would be stretched out.

18:41.068 --> 18:41.931
Well, no, the road.

18:41.971 --> 18:45.383
I mean, we're talking about trying to protect 20 miles of road or 25.

18:46.687 --> 18:47.349
That's a lot of road.

18:47.550 --> 18:48.212
It is.

18:49.846 --> 18:51.228
Okay, anything else?

18:53.071 --> 18:58.398
We've got a few things here on the table that you mentioned the Montagnards and the bow with the tiger.

18:58.418 --> 19:02.063
And obviously this is not the bow, but this is one that you brought back.

19:02.384 --> 19:06.069
Yeah, this is what I thought killed the tiger.

19:06.089 --> 19:07.010
Now I should have known better.

19:07.491 --> 19:14.200
This is the quiver and you can see this is made out of bamboo, these arrows.

19:14.635 --> 19:17.838
And all of these were obviously hand-fashioned and handmade.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.700
Oh, yeah.

19:19.740 --> 19:23.923
And this is really some fine work if you'll look at it.

19:23.943 --> 19:25.144
And it's got the little trigger there.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.926
And this is pulled back and placed in there.

19:27.687 --> 19:29.148
And the arrow there.

19:29.268 --> 19:35.574
Did you ever get a chance to see them use one of these, even if it was just for practicing to see how accurate they were?

19:35.914 --> 19:37.215
No, I tried to use it.

19:37.315 --> 19:39.537
But, you know, it's so hard to pull this back.

19:39.557 --> 19:41.119
But I did shoot this.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.642
But the mine yard would just stick it in their stomach and pull it back.

19:44.622 --> 19:48.347
And here's another interesting piece that you brought with you.

19:48.427 --> 19:51.592
Well, this is a North Vietnamese, we call them hard hats.

19:52.172 --> 19:59.162
And the North Vietnamese regulars, the NVA would, a lot of times, they would be wearing hard hats.

19:59.202 --> 20:03.388
Kind of like our helmet, except it's really not a... It wouldn't protect much.

20:03.548 --> 20:08.455
It's a sun helmet, what it is, actually, rather than a... Keep the shade off your head, and that's about all it would be good for.

20:10.258 --> 20:11.980
So we picked up a lot of those.

20:12.331 --> 20:20.525
We've also, you also were kind enough to give us about 15 or 16 pictures we can pull up here and have some pretty interesting pictures here.

20:20.545 --> 20:30.221
Explain this to us because... Well, that's about, whenever the Battle of the Britain, the Battle of Britain went on 1940, I don't know if it's 40 or 41, probably 1940.

20:30.261 --> 20:31.363
That's you on the left, right?

20:31.383 --> 20:33.006
That's me on the left.

20:32.986 --> 20:40.033
I've been a collector of stuff all my life, and that was one of my first collections there was that aerial bomb.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.655
I think it's a practice bomb.

20:42.195 --> 20:44.878
I bought it in a junkyard, and I had that.

20:44.898 --> 20:48.421
So this is my good buddy Joe Earl Hodgkins on the right there.

20:49.683 --> 20:53.246
He was my running mate, partner in crime and so forth.

20:53.266 --> 20:54.427
And this was up at Lake Worth.

20:54.447 --> 20:57.470
And this was out at Lake Worth at my grandfather's store, J.R.

20:57.510 --> 21:02.335
Foster Ice and Feed store.

21:02.517 --> 21:10.788
So I decided, well, I was going to help the British, so I put this up, collected money, and then took it down to the, I think it was the British Aid Society and turned it into them.

21:10.889 --> 21:12.511
So I'm trying to do my bit.

21:12.791 --> 21:16.096
And that was my freshman year.

21:16.116 --> 21:17.298
That's a strapping young man right there.

21:17.338 --> 21:21.223
Freshman year, just turned 17 when I entered A&M.

21:23.606 --> 21:26.170
I've been here a while because you can see I was pretty underweight.

21:27.031 --> 21:28.934
They already worked you somehow.

21:28.954 --> 21:29.875
That's right, yeah.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.429
And that's the senior ring dance.

21:33.109 --> 21:35.231
Now, there's an interesting story behind this.

21:35.251 --> 21:45.942
Well, this particular picture with you, the former students had that picture over there for a little article they put in the Texas Aggie some time ago.

21:46.002 --> 21:54.791
And then my granddaughter graduated here last year and she went over to get a ring and they gave her a brochure about the Aggie ring and so forth.

21:54.851 --> 21:57.234
And she opened it up and recognized our picture.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.275
They had used our picture.

21:58.295 --> 21:59.216
My goodness.

21:59.236 --> 22:00.317
Without authority.

22:00.668 --> 22:03.371
Did you contact them and talk residuals?

22:03.452 --> 22:05.554
Well, maybe I should.

22:06.716 --> 22:07.417
It's a great picture.

22:09.299 --> 22:13.224
Now this... Okay, those are the survivors of Company D infantry.

22:13.244 --> 22:18.451
We started out with about 38 and we wound up with, this is just before graduation, with eight.

22:19.272 --> 22:23.938
And you'll notice the guy in the uniform there on the back row, that's Jarvis Miller, former president.

22:23.958 --> 22:27.182
So at one time, the class of 50 had the president

22:28.006 --> 22:29.652
and Commandant of Cadets.

22:30.235 --> 22:31.921
You didn't know it then, but you were both right there.

22:32.041 --> 22:32.503
That's right.

22:33.226 --> 22:37.442
And that's, I was about 17, and that's when I joined the Navy Reserve and

22:38.013 --> 22:40.497
That was in Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans.

22:41.078 --> 22:43.122
And I'll tell you that's a Pat O'Brien's hurricane sitting there.

22:43.142 --> 22:45.185
It's a hurricane punch, I think they call it.

22:45.205 --> 22:47.369
And your pack of Lucky Strikes.

22:47.389 --> 22:50.574
I was smoking in those days, and there's a pack of Lucky Strikes.

22:51.516 --> 22:54.080
And Lucky Strike had gone to war, see that white pack.

22:54.100 --> 22:54.521
Exactly.

22:54.961 --> 22:58.748
And that's me when I was a lieutenant in the 2nd Armored Division.

22:58.768 --> 23:03.075
I was in the 41st Armored Infantry Battalion, a platoon leader.

23:03.055 --> 23:06.319
In fact, I commanded the same platoon for almost four years.

23:07.060 --> 23:10.024
There was only one place to go that was up.

23:10.044 --> 23:22.038
That's the An K marketplace that my battalion, the civil affairs people built for the Vietnamese, and that's the district chief there.

23:22.058 --> 23:24.962
I doubt if he made it.

23:26.275 --> 23:32.447
And that's General Barnes, the commander of 173rd Airborne, and that's when they presented me with a Silver Star.

23:32.627 --> 23:38.779
And you were presented to Silver Star due to that battle there on February 14th of 69th.

23:38.839 --> 23:39.119
St.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.602
Valentine's Day Massacre.

23:40.642 --> 23:44.470
Right, exactly.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.752
And that's me just...

23:48.196 --> 23:49.939
popping a few caps, you know, shooting.

23:50.399 --> 23:53.364
This is on February the 14th, but the enemy, they were withdrawing.

23:53.444 --> 23:56.549
I thought, well, I'll just send them a little souvenir.

23:57.530 --> 23:58.331
Make sure they've left.

23:58.992 --> 24:02.397
And one thing you notice about this picture, everybody's hunched over.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.541
And that's, well, I call it the combat crouch.

24:05.101 --> 24:07.425
Because you think you're making yourself a smaller target.

24:07.445 --> 24:14.075
That's Captain Cheney, who's the company commander of the reaction force that joined us in that battle.

24:14.095 --> 24:16.819
And on the right, the popular forces

24:16.799 --> 24:20.185
that came out to help, and that's me in the center.

24:20.205 --> 24:24.732
And if you look in the back, I don't know if you can see it or not, but you can see the trucks and the smoke and all that.

24:24.753 --> 24:29.621
I've already moved all the trucks out of this area, but we're getting ready to make another sweep.

24:29.681 --> 24:32.125
That's one of my personnel carriers.

24:32.493 --> 24:37.941
We need to move on here if I can get Sandra to come on back because we've only got three minutes left, believe it or not.

24:38.241 --> 24:44.570
And something else I want to show the people here is, like I said in the open, you have a lot of medals that you were awarded.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.875
And this is just the shadow blocks that you were kind enough to bring.

24:48.015 --> 24:52.782
And the folks can see the plethora of awards.

24:52.802 --> 24:57.589
And as we get to the top here, you can tell us what those three right there in the middle are.

24:58.092 --> 25:00.877
Well, there's a silver star.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.301
That's the one with the red, white, and blue ribbon.

25:03.361 --> 25:05.384
And in the middle is the Legion of Merit.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.610
And then the other one is the Bronze Star.

25:08.870 --> 25:09.311
Right.

25:09.331 --> 25:15.000
And that's kind of my career in that one case with the battalions and the regiments I was in.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.687
We've only got a couple minutes left, believe it or not.

25:18.807 --> 25:21.832
And you said you wanted to talk just a brief minute about the Corps.

25:21.852 --> 25:23.695
Well, that was the greatest job I ever had.

25:24.113 --> 25:25.997
was common on the Corps.

25:27.299 --> 25:34.494
I'm really concerned about the size of the Corps and about the difficulty we're having in recruiting people to come in the Corps.

25:34.554 --> 25:40.867
I will never understand why some of them would come down to A&M and not want to be in the Corps of Cadets.

25:41.669 --> 25:42.470
You get so much.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.755
You get a mental toughness.

25:44.937 --> 25:46.258
learn to operate under stress.

25:46.298 --> 25:47.399
There's so many advantages.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.783
They're not getting their money's worth if they're not in the Corps of Cadets.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.487
And if you think about it, if we didn't have the Corps of Cadets, what would we have?

25:55.527 --> 26:00.151
We would have a campus dominated, the dominant force would be fraternities and sororities.

26:00.872 --> 26:12.463
And so we might as well call it University of Texas at College Station because it would soon be just like university over there if it wasn't for the Corps of Cadets.

26:13.456 --> 26:16.284
I agree with you wholeheartedly, and I'm sure quite a few other people on Talwood, too.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.774
I'll probably get some flack about that, but you know I've had flack before.

26:20.015 --> 26:20.697
You've been around it.

26:21.078 --> 26:21.961
I think you can weather it.

26:22.021 --> 26:23.345
That's right.

26:23.585 --> 26:24.588
We're out of time totally.

26:24.628 --> 26:26.434
I would like to thank you so much for being here.

26:26.454 --> 26:26.995
It was a pleasure.

26:27.075 --> 26:27.617
Thank you.

26:28.373 --> 26:32.698
You know, Colonel Woodall served his country with pride, honor, and distinction.

26:32.718 --> 26:35.822
He had a military career that lasted over 35 years.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.186
He's been awarded so many medals that we couldn't mention them all.

26:39.626 --> 26:52.461
He had the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with Valor Device and two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Air Medal with seven Oak Leaf Clusters.

26:52.481 --> 26:54.043
The list goes on and on.

26:54.023 --> 27:01.694
Veterans of the Valley salutes Colonel James Woodall for his unwavering dedication and commitment to serving the country he loves.
