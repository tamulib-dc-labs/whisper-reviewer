00:05.583 --> 00:29.165
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.185 --> 00:30.207
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:30.963 --> 00:39.078
It's a simple fact that World War II could not have been fought, much less won, without naval construction battalions, better known as Seabees.

00:39.559 --> 00:43.767
Today you'll meet John Blazens of Bryan, but I dare say that many of you already know him.

00:44.348 --> 00:48.195
After all, he has lived all but 10 of his 82 years in Bryan.

00:48.175 --> 01:03.225
Born in Bryan, proud member of Stephen F. Austin High School Class of 1942, Aggie Class of 1947, and a proud sailor with the 105th Seabees, serving the Pacific Campaign in Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines at the Leyte Gulf.

01:03.245 --> 01:05.310
It's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.534
I want to talk about a man who

01:07.514 --> 01:27.295
probably knows brian as well as anybody you were born here i know your dad was in the grocery business and also in the cotton business here born in brian and spent like we said all but 10 years in brian talk about what brian texas was like back in the the 1930s i guess when you were just a young kid growing up what was the town like well brian was main street

01:27.410 --> 01:30.996
A few businesses on Bryan Street.

01:31.757 --> 01:36.064
Basically, everything went up and down Main Street.

01:36.364 --> 01:44.136
All the grocery stores were there, as well as the clothing stores and the drug stores.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.882
Just about anything that you wanted at that

01:47.913 --> 01:52.639
So what we know is downtown Bryan now, that's just where practically all the commerce was.

01:52.699 --> 01:57.725
When you wanted to buy something, go to the grocery store, go to a movie, go get clothes, you went to downtown Bryan.

01:58.005 --> 01:58.505
That's true.

01:58.826 --> 02:06.234
You parked at the curb and walked into the business you wanted to deal with, and then you drove two blocks down the street and parked at the curb again.

02:06.475 --> 02:07.516
Right, right.

02:07.536 --> 02:10.159
And Bryan, as we know it today, it wasn't anything like it then.

02:10.179 --> 02:17.768
It was pretty much a shrunk version of what we see now because the paved roads were sort of few and far between, right?

02:18.119 --> 02:18.940
That's correct.

02:19.000 --> 02:32.621
Texas Avenue was Highway 6, and there was a paved street that went west to serve Bowie Elementary School, and there was a paved street that went east to serve Travis Elementary School, and that was pretty near it.

02:32.641 --> 02:43.278
So if you wanted to get from downtown Bryan to Texas A&M, you would take Highway 6 up to what we know as the bend right now, and then that would go on to College Avenue on the campus.

02:43.298 --> 02:44.560
That's how you got to campus, right?

02:44.580 --> 02:46.202
College Avenue, Old College Road.

02:46.739 --> 02:50.683
and what is now Weldon Road to get to the campus.

02:50.764 --> 02:51.104
Right.

02:51.124 --> 02:54.948
Of course, you had Texas A&M on the other side, and then you had Brian.

02:55.149 --> 03:01.616
How did the citizenry and all of that deal with Texas A&M?

03:01.716 --> 03:06.241
Obviously, Texas A&M was a big industry then, just like it is now.

03:06.261 --> 03:13.730
Yes, and of course, Brian probably felt then much like College Station does now, the home of Texas A&M.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.130
Right.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.991
It was the agriculture and mechanical college.

03:18.011 --> 03:19.756
You said that your dad was in the cotton business.

03:19.836 --> 03:25.790
Cotton was a big industry back then in Bryan, and that had a lot to do with the railroad, I guess, right?

03:26.171 --> 03:31.444
Well, cotton was the valley, the brightest bottom, the farmers.

03:32.352 --> 03:37.667
raised mostly cotton as far as a pay prop went.

03:37.687 --> 03:38.389
Right, right.

03:39.452 --> 03:43.424
You went to Stephen F. Austin, as a matter of fact, this past summer.

03:43.444 --> 03:45.670
It's actually after we're taping this, but

03:45.970 --> 03:53.437
before it's airing on TV in June, you had a reunion at the class of 1942 of Stephen F. Austin High School.

03:53.457 --> 03:59.183
A lot of people, of course, obviously know that was the pre of what we know now as Bryan High School.

03:59.203 --> 04:02.866
Talk a little bit about Stephen F. Austin back in the 40s.

04:03.247 --> 04:06.290
Obviously, it was a wonderful school, a lot of great memories.

04:06.310 --> 04:15.859
Well, yeah, Stephen F. Austin was a new high school, and Lamar Junior High School originated in the original

04:16.193 --> 04:18.087
high school building so that

04:18.505 --> 04:24.572
When I went, Stephen F. Austin was only about three years old in the facility as it is today.

04:24.792 --> 04:25.593
Right.

04:25.613 --> 04:30.920
And we had the three classes and lots of football support, of course.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.323
That was still the number one sport.

04:33.343 --> 04:40.151
Speaking of football, you were the class of 1942, but you actually didn't receive your diploma until after the fall of 1942.

04:40.271 --> 04:46.318
And that had something to do with football and your desire to play quarterback that last year in the fall of 1942.

04:46.438 --> 04:48.040
Sort of talk about how that worked.

04:48.222 --> 04:54.488
Well, it was just the fact that you could play high school football until you were 18.

04:55.529 --> 05:00.834
And so I was 17 and was eligible to play another semester.

05:01.294 --> 05:08.381
So I did not graduate in May of 42, but came back that fall.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.924
And took an English class or something like that?

05:10.964 --> 05:14.067
Or took a couple of classes in the fall so you could be eligible for football, right?

05:14.127 --> 05:14.567
Yes.

05:14.699 --> 05:18.113
English was one of the state mandated courses.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.688
If you didn't have all your English credits, you couldn't graduate.

05:21.770 --> 05:22.331
Right.

05:22.351 --> 05:26.135
So you waited until the fall to take that so you could play football and then finish.

05:26.155 --> 05:31.641
And I think you told me you were the first T-formation quarterback of Brian High or Stephen F. Austin, right?

05:31.662 --> 05:32.302
Yes, that's true.

05:34.685 --> 05:35.406
That's great.

05:35.426 --> 05:39.010
Right after you graduated from high school, you entered Texas A&M.

05:39.050 --> 05:44.657
So actually that would have been in the spring semester, I guess earlier January of 1943.

05:44.717 --> 05:46.319
That's when you entered Texas A&M.

05:46.339 --> 05:46.979
That's correct.

05:47.220 --> 05:47.800
Yeah, yeah.

05:48.021 --> 05:50.123
I went one semester to Texas A&M.

05:50.103 --> 05:53.789
And then, of course, we were already involved in the war, this being in 1943.

05:53.849 --> 06:07.752
Then talk about your desire to enter the service, and particularly the Navy, and you sort of had to, the timing was such to where if you wanted to be in the Navy, you had to go to Houston on a particular time and say hello to the draft office.

06:07.772 --> 06:10.236
Sort of talk about your desire to be in the Navy.

06:10.256 --> 06:16.887
Well, at 18, you became draft eligible, and we had to,

06:17.120 --> 06:27.670
We looked at the military and some of us wanted to be in the Navy and others wanted to wait until they were drafted and I was one of those that had the desire to be in the Navy.

06:28.139 --> 06:32.727
So your dad took you to Houston on the day that when the draftees were being put in the Navy.

06:32.807 --> 06:35.732
So you timed it that way on purpose so that you could be in the Navy.

06:35.752 --> 06:36.573
That's correct.

06:36.593 --> 06:37.214
Right, right.

06:37.715 --> 06:40.420
And tell us where you were sent initially.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.866
I know you were sent to the East Coast and then a long, long trip to the West Coast.

06:43.886 --> 06:48.173
So after you up, sort of talk about your training before you went overseas.

06:48.423 --> 06:55.294
Well, there was a CB training base at Williamsburg, Virginia, right on the Chesapeake Bay.

06:55.975 --> 07:00.101
And we were sent there for what they call boot camp still.

07:00.983 --> 07:08.214
And then we were assigned to battalions and moved out to different parts of the world.

07:08.435 --> 07:08.635
Right.

07:08.795 --> 07:16.287
So it wasn't until you went to Virginia that you realized that you were going to be assigned to the construction battalion and that you were going to be a CB, right?

07:16.334 --> 07:20.800
Yes, I was told I was a CB before we left Texas.

07:20.860 --> 07:24.684
Before you left Texas, so you knew what you were in for and that you would be there.

07:24.704 --> 07:29.130
A three-week train ride from Virginia to California, and they took quite a route.

07:29.811 --> 07:31.973
You remember that three-week train ride a lot, don't you?

07:32.334 --> 07:32.654
Yes.

07:33.896 --> 07:43.708
I suppose it was for security purposes, but we went up into Ohio and back down to the Texas Panhandle, and then the train went all the way to South Chicago.

07:44.127 --> 07:52.144
and then back down to New Mexico and finally up through Salt Lake City and cross the mountains there into California.

07:52.925 --> 07:53.967
Three weeks on the train.

07:55.671 --> 07:59.098
That was quite a ride and quite an indirect route to get there.

07:59.264 --> 08:08.117
Port Wynnebe, I believe it is, in Southern California, which is a base that is known for its training of sea bees.

08:08.137 --> 08:11.542
It's one of the largest sea bee centers, or the largest on the West Coast.

08:12.403 --> 08:13.585
Talk about that.

08:13.665 --> 08:15.888
It still exists with a museum there, I believe.

08:16.229 --> 08:26.183
Well, that was the base where our battalion organized itself in a big manner and went through typical training.

08:26.517 --> 08:41.039
We had all the rumors of going to Alaska or going to South Pacific that abounded in, I guess, every military organization, but we were being prepared.

08:41.981 --> 08:42.642
Right.

08:42.662 --> 08:44.685
John, I want you to talk about the Seabees.

08:44.705 --> 08:48.370
I have always been personally just fascinated with the work that they did.

08:48.391 --> 08:54.600
While some people might not consider it the big action spot of the war,

08:54.867 --> 08:56.448
It's true.

08:56.468 --> 09:05.357
I mean, the war could not have been fought, could not have been won without what the Seabees did, especially in the Pacific theater, in the Pacific campaign, because y'all built stuff.

09:05.397 --> 09:14.305
Y'all made something out of nothing as far as runways, as far as Quonset huts, like you talk about, bridges, piers, and things like that.

09:14.805 --> 09:22.292
Talk about the Seabees to the people that may not be familiar with exactly what the role of the Seabees was in World War II.

09:22.475 --> 09:29.304
In an island war, of course, each island had its individual problems.

09:30.105 --> 09:43.121
And Seabees went in, and our job was to prepare airstrips or to prepare buildings for training and some hospitals.

09:44.463 --> 09:47.807
We built our battalion hospitals.

09:48.530 --> 09:52.697
built a base for PT boats in the Philippines.

09:53.198 --> 10:04.497
And so we did a little bit of all kinds of construction work and that permitted those involved in the actual combat

10:04.848 --> 10:09.595
go about their business without worrying about details maybe.

10:09.615 --> 10:09.876
Right.

10:09.996 --> 10:11.919
Well, planes needed a runway to land on.

10:11.939 --> 10:13.902
And once they got there, they needed a place to live.

10:14.703 --> 10:20.812
Storage was a big deal, obviously, because there was equipment constantly being supplied to the Pacific theater.

10:21.113 --> 10:22.295
Where are you going to put all this stuff?

10:23.256 --> 10:29.846
One of the things you were involved in was the building of Quonset huts and not just for people to live, but you talked about how they were strung together to make warehouses.

10:29.866 --> 10:32.610
So you were heavy into construction, right?

10:32.630 --> 10:32.911
Yes.

10:32.971 --> 10:33.792
Well,

10:34.463 --> 10:38.470
I was assigned to a crew that was primarily involved in building quantity.

10:39.131 --> 10:42.156
So we built small ones for officer quarters.

10:42.216 --> 10:48.226
We built larger ones for people to live in, the crews and everything.

10:48.367 --> 10:58.564
Or we built, tied them together in a way to make some very enormous warehouse facilities because the supplies that were coming to the Pacific

10:59.050 --> 11:01.233
It was very enormous.

11:01.253 --> 11:12.308
When we went to the Philippines, I think that there were over 150 ships in Lady Gulf at one time, right at the time of the re-invasion.

11:12.328 --> 11:13.430
Right, right.

11:13.450 --> 11:17.916
And when we're talking about supplies, we're not just talking about guns and ammo and things like that.

11:17.936 --> 11:24.825
We're talking about tanks and trucks and the vehicles that it took to fight the war.

11:24.865 --> 11:27.589
I mean, we're talking about large, large equipment

11:27.957 --> 11:30.024
that you all had to deal with and find a place for.

11:30.045 --> 11:32.554
Yes, that and food.

11:32.574 --> 11:37.090
An enormous amount of food had to be brought in to serve our troops.

11:37.407 --> 11:38.308
Right, right.

11:38.328 --> 11:45.558
And this is food, I guess, that you had to make sure that it didn't spoil and had to be properly cared for and all that and feed the troops.

11:45.578 --> 11:50.224
So it's just a fascinating part of the war, the Navy Seabees.

11:50.544 --> 11:59.817
When you left California initially, I want to back up a little bit, you first went down south to Australia and then straight north of Australia to New Guinea before you went to the Philippines.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.061
So talk about your route from California and what you did at each place.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.026
Well, rather than a convoy, our troop ship was

12:07.428 --> 12:36.253
alone so it went as far south as it could reasonably go and then in order to avoid Japanese submarines and then circle around and then came back north and and landed on the east coast of Australia or at least we anchored there for about a month before they moved us on north to New Guinea and of course at that time combat was still underway

12:36.605 --> 12:39.109
on the island of New Guinea.

12:39.129 --> 12:53.793
And then when they got ready to recapture the Philippine Islands, well, then we were loaded onto transports that had all of our supplies and equipment on them.

12:53.873 --> 13:02.386
And we headed north and ended up at Lady Gulf on the same day that General MacArthur returned.

13:02.406 --> 13:02.747
I see.

13:03.068 --> 13:03.388
I see.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.273
Latte Gulf, obviously a hot spot of the Pacific campaign.

13:07.313 --> 13:13.127
And while you say you weren't directly involved in combat operations, you could hear it from where you were, right?

13:13.147 --> 13:15.273
That's correct.

13:15.293 --> 13:17.057
They were pretty close to us anyway.

13:17.932 --> 13:19.054
Right, right.

13:20.757 --> 13:37.948
You said that one of the things that your unit did was build piers and you believe that possibly where you were may have been involved where former President John F. Kennedy and his PT boat might have docked because he was in the Philippines at one time in his service, right?

13:38.182 --> 13:44.030
Yes, there was a PT base between the island of Leyte and the island of Samar.

13:45.953 --> 13:55.646
The ocean channel there was pretty narrow and the PT boat should come in there and dock and re-service and make plans to go back into the ocean.

13:55.906 --> 13:58.890
Right, right, right.

13:59.090 --> 14:02.475
Three photos that Mr. Blazens has supplied us.

14:02.535 --> 14:05.500
These are photos from his home that I want to show you.

14:05.741 --> 14:08.645
Young John Blazens at Texas A&M and then later in the Navy.

14:09.066 --> 14:10.388
And you can see that picture right there.

14:10.528 --> 14:12.832
Is that your senior picture at Texas A&M?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.034
Well, we had it up on the screen.

14:14.635 --> 14:17.379
And now it has gone away.

14:17.439 --> 14:17.940
Oh, there we go.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.362
There you are back again.

14:19.382 --> 14:21.165
Is that your senior photo at Texas A&M?

14:21.652 --> 14:24.377
Well, I would more or less say that was my freshman photo.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.119
Your freshman photo.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.483
After the war, I did not have to be in the Corps.

14:28.604 --> 14:28.984
That's right.

14:29.004 --> 14:29.745
You weren't in the Corps.

14:29.846 --> 14:35.615
So that would have been your first year, that one semester before you went into the Navy.

14:35.635 --> 14:37.679
Quite a good-looking young man.

14:37.699 --> 14:37.919
Wow.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.148
And then the next photo is a little later when you were in a Navy photograph.

14:43.188 --> 14:45.732
So this was taken just a few years later?

14:46.233 --> 14:46.533
Yes.

14:47.094 --> 14:47.395
That's correct.

14:47.415 --> 14:47.575
Right.

14:48.770 --> 14:52.035
And now we've got a picture of one of your units.

14:52.876 --> 14:55.099
As you can see, we're gonna enlarge that a little bit.

14:56.842 --> 15:04.293
You can see that that's from a book, sort of an annual yearbook that was made of the 105th Seabees, Chief Lambing's crew.

15:04.313 --> 15:08.579
And I believe you said that you were on the back row, sort of in the middle, is that right?

15:08.619 --> 15:09.701
Fourth from the left?

15:09.721 --> 15:09.981
Yes.

15:10.301 --> 15:10.762
There you are.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.366
Yeah, fourth from the left on the back row.

15:13.386 --> 15:16.991
So that was essentially the laboring crew right there that you worked with?

15:17.011 --> 15:18.253
That's correct.

15:18.993 --> 15:30.673
particular time and we were building these all storage tanks in the Philippines and they were built from sheets of steel which were connected with nuts and bolts and washers.

15:32.315 --> 15:35.641
And that's one of the storage tanks that you're standing in front of.

15:35.881 --> 15:36.482
Right.

15:36.863 --> 15:45.237
And these storage tanks, I know you talked to me earlier about a lot of the storage that you all did was oil.

15:45.419 --> 15:50.890
and things like that, and that was kind of a dicey situation in case the enemy should come over.

15:50.910 --> 15:56.060
You didn't want that oil sitting out there because that would have been a bomb waiting to go off, right?

15:56.941 --> 16:06.700
Well, that's probably true, although by the time we were building on those, the United States had pretty much air superiority.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.203
Right, right, right.

16:08.437 --> 16:10.339
You were in the Philippines when the war ended.

16:10.359 --> 16:15.384
And at that time, I believe you said you had your choice of joining the occupational forces or going home.

16:15.404 --> 16:18.808
And you decided to go home and continue your education.

16:18.828 --> 16:22.091
So talk about that decision and what your desires were then.

16:23.172 --> 16:27.316
Well, I guess at that age, I still wasn't 21.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.140
I had been away from home over two years.

16:31.160 --> 16:36.706
And I got a little homesick as well as wanting to get back into school.

16:37.347 --> 16:37.667
Indeed.

16:37.951 --> 16:40.275
And in all, you were overseas for two years.

16:40.295 --> 16:44.703
So you had served a good service there from December of 43 to December of 1945.

16:45.484 --> 16:49.832
And you came back home and you went right back into Texas A&M while you were class of 47.

16:50.232 --> 16:54.199
You ended up not getting out until 1950 because of your war service.

16:54.279 --> 16:58.907
And you took your CB experience and went right into civil engineering.

16:58.928 --> 16:59.348
Is that right?

16:59.388 --> 17:01.512
Talk about that and what your career was after that.

17:01.593 --> 17:14.472
Well, basically, that's one of life's events that made me decide what I wanted to do, and I came back and said I wanted to major in civil engineering, which I did.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.016
And you helped build highways, is that right?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.859
You worked for the highway department for several years.

17:19.099 --> 17:19.880
That's correct.

17:19.900 --> 17:26.270
I worked for the Texas Highway Department, or now the Department of Transportation, for 37 years.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.271
Spent eight years in Brenham?

17:27.571 --> 17:27.672
Yeah.

17:27.692 --> 17:28.613
Talk about what you did then.

17:28.981 --> 17:39.256
Well, I was in the residency there, and we were contracting and constructing various highways in Washington County at that time.

17:39.276 --> 17:41.620
Right, including 290 that goes around Brenham.

17:42.621 --> 17:45.626
That's correct, yeah.

17:45.646 --> 17:47.008
Then I came to Bryan.

17:47.048 --> 17:56.642
I was made the district construction engineer in the Bryan District, which encompasses 10 counties that surround Brazos County.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.222
One thing we haven't talked about is your athletic career.

17:59.242 --> 18:05.528
We talked about that you played quarterback for Stephen F. Austin your senior year, but then you became a baseball man.

18:05.588 --> 18:07.690
As a matter of fact, you're wearing your baseball tie today.

18:08.350 --> 18:13.195
You played for Marty Carroll's Texas A&M team, I believe, for a year.

18:13.755 --> 18:19.341
And you described yourself as a scrub, but you were a middle infielder.

18:19.361 --> 18:25.246
And so talk about your experiences in baseball, which later became actually a semi-pro career in Brenham.

18:25.266 --> 18:26.207
So talk about...

18:26.187 --> 18:28.832
John Blazins and his baseball career?

18:28.852 --> 18:37.048
Well, I had played baseball with local teams in Bryan while I was at A&M.

18:37.649 --> 18:47.247
And as I mentioned before, one year in 1948, Marty Grose said he was shorthanded and he put out a call and it was kind of like the 12th man.

18:47.267 --> 18:47.588
And I

18:47.855 --> 18:56.429
A couple hundred of us came out, and we worked out for two or three weeks at different times, and he chose about four of us to be on the baseball squad.

18:56.810 --> 19:01.117
So this is sort of a 12-man story that few people know about, is the call for the baseball team.

19:01.137 --> 19:07.829
And you say a couple hundred showed up, and it just sort of got pared down and pared down, and you were one of four that made the eventual cut.

19:07.849 --> 19:09.812
I was one of the lucky ones.

19:10.265 --> 19:17.637
I enjoyed the experience of being on the NM baseball team and we get season tickets and go to all the games we can.

19:18.619 --> 19:24.128
Now this was back when the baseball field was in essentially what the parking lot of Kyle Field is now, right?

19:24.148 --> 19:25.270
That's correct.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.118
Yeah.

19:27.138 --> 19:35.190
And then your baseball career continued somewhat when you went to Brenham because you played for the semi-pro team there in Brenham, the Brenham Lions, right?

19:35.210 --> 19:35.871
That's correct.

19:36.131 --> 19:42.100
They had the semi-pro team there, which were mostly local Brenham men and boys.

19:42.901 --> 19:52.995
And we played different teams all around Texas, from Houston primarily, and teams like Giddings and LaGrange and

19:52.975 --> 19:56.804
At that time, they all had baseball teams.

19:57.365 --> 19:58.247
Right, right.

19:58.548 --> 20:02.277
And there was a fellow on this Brenham team who had a sister named Madeline.

20:02.537 --> 20:02.718
Yeah.

20:03.078 --> 20:04.502
Yeah, that worked out pretty good for you.

20:04.522 --> 20:05.905
Tell us about that.

20:06.155 --> 20:08.599
I've been married to Madeline for 56 years.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.024
That's right.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.025
So you met her.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.091
She was a sister of one of your teammates.

20:15.231 --> 20:15.952
That's correct.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.458
And you all have been married for some 56 years now.

20:20.801 --> 20:22.584
And you still love baseball.

20:22.684 --> 20:25.429
I think you said you even pitched for your...

20:25.409 --> 20:28.373
for your church when you were 65 in the softball league, right?

20:28.413 --> 20:29.515
Slow pitch.

20:29.535 --> 20:31.457
Slow pitch.

20:31.557 --> 20:33.019
A lot slower pitch, is that right?

20:34.161 --> 20:35.082
You and Madeline were married.

20:35.102 --> 20:36.264
Talk a little bit about your family.

20:36.304 --> 20:39.909
I know you have a couple of kids and grandkids.

20:39.929 --> 20:41.411
Talk about your kids and what they do.

20:41.971 --> 20:45.937
You are fortunate in that your kids and your grandkids both live here in the area, right?

20:45.957 --> 20:46.978
That's correct, yes.

20:47.414 --> 20:59.112
Our son, David, has a small construction company called Blaco Construction, and he does work in the local area.

20:59.713 --> 21:04.140
He and his wife, Beth, have one son, Andrew,

21:04.829 --> 21:06.551
We'll be 18 this year.

21:06.871 --> 21:07.131
Right.

21:07.792 --> 21:16.539
And then our daughter, Sarah, she's an Aggie sociology grader and she works for the Bryan Independent School District.

21:16.719 --> 21:17.000
Right.

21:17.480 --> 21:27.729
And she and her husband have two children, Reed, who is 16, and Melissa, who is 12.

21:28.230 --> 21:28.650
Right.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.572
And so they're both in the community.

21:31.352 --> 21:33.334
Reed and Melissa are swimmers and they do

21:33.770 --> 21:36.494
competitive swimming and so on.

21:36.514 --> 21:44.988
I think you said your daughter with the BISD is involved with a lot of the families that are still in the area that were evacuees from Katrina, so that takes up a lot of her time, right?

21:45.008 --> 21:49.095
She's involved with some of those who are students at Bryan Hotsky.

21:49.514 --> 21:55.261
I want to rewind a little bit some of your times at Texas A&M that you talked about.

21:55.642 --> 21:57.144
You can recall December 7, 1941.

21:57.404 --> 21:58.365
You were 16.

21:58.425 --> 21:59.326
You were in high school.

21:59.366 --> 22:02.270
And what did your dad say to you about that time?

22:02.330 --> 22:04.493
It turned out to be a profitable statement.

22:05.013 --> 22:06.996
It turned out to be a profit on the statement.

22:07.016 --> 22:08.458
Yes, that's true.

22:08.478 --> 22:14.425
When we heard about it that day, he looked at me and said, if this last

22:14.708 --> 22:17.212
long enough, you'll be involved.

22:18.915 --> 22:19.475
And he was right.

22:19.516 --> 22:20.497
Certainly he was right.

22:20.517 --> 22:20.958
Indeed.

22:20.978 --> 22:22.761
You were involved in the war.

22:22.801 --> 22:28.229
When you were in high school, you did come to A&M campus every once in a while to attend football games.

22:28.810 --> 22:34.719
You said when the Knothole League came up, you were able to watch Aggie football games.

22:34.739 --> 22:37.003
What do you remember about Aggie football back when you were in high school?

22:37.793 --> 22:41.864
Well, for us Aggie football was the only football at that time.

22:42.024 --> 22:42.505
Exactly.

22:43.147 --> 22:46.175
We watched them and supported them strongly.

22:46.456 --> 22:47.719
Right.

22:49.218 --> 22:55.546
I don't know whether worship is the right word, but we worship the stars that came up along those days.

22:55.566 --> 22:55.846
1939.

22:55.886 --> 22:57.548
Dick Todd and John Kimbrough.

22:57.568 --> 22:59.791
1939, they won the national championship.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.594
So you were, yeah, you were here at that time.

23:03.676 --> 23:14.449
You told me a funny story about when Franklin D. Roosevelt came to College Station and came to Kyle Field and they sort of recruited people to make it look crowded at Kyle Field, right?

23:14.469 --> 23:14.769
Right.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.993
He made a speech there and I think

23:18.563 --> 23:22.997
The entire city of Bryan closed down just about and everybody went out to Kyle Field.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.768
It made it look like there was a crowd in the grandstand.

23:26.933 --> 23:32.179
And you were one of them that was in the background, right?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.540
Right.

23:34.441 --> 23:41.409
The Navy Seabees, again, it's a facet of the service that I'm fascinated with.

23:43.151 --> 23:50.038
Obviously, being a member of the Seabees is something that you're very proud of because it obviously gave you your career, gave you the skills that

23:50.018 --> 24:14.760
that they gave you your career sort of talk about your your deep feelings and your lifelong feelings about this this group and the people well it's sometimes difficult to express how you feel about an organization these were people who came from all parts of life the leaders

24:15.348 --> 24:20.193
of the CBs were experienced construction people.

24:21.234 --> 24:25.098
You mentioned Chief Lambding, who was from Lufkin.

24:25.879 --> 24:28.521
He had been in the construction business for a number of years.

24:29.402 --> 24:40.193
And so those of us who came in, say, through the draft, we were assigned there to perform the labor.

24:40.213 --> 24:44.798
But there were a lot of those young men who became accomplished

24:45.115 --> 24:48.579
and skilled at certain amounts of parts of the work.

24:50.641 --> 24:54.386
Some of us got a hold of construction equipment we had never seen.

24:55.387 --> 25:07.621
When we were building the piers, there were a lot of drills and jackhammers and saws that went on and the young guys were the ones that had to perform that work.

25:08.061 --> 25:13.367
I have been proud that

25:13.786 --> 25:18.252
that the organization has set up these museums.

25:19.293 --> 25:23.299
There are museums for all facets of the military service around.

25:23.519 --> 25:35.014
In Mississippi and in California now, there are CB museums, which have recorded some of the work that the CBs did.

25:35.495 --> 25:39.540
There wasn't much of it like John Wayne's movie,

25:39.605 --> 25:45.197
They got into a battle, but occasionally it was frightening.

25:45.217 --> 25:45.317
Yeah.

25:45.658 --> 25:54.998
Well, I think it's just incredible some of the pictures that I've seen, especially in the Philippines and Okinawa and Guadalcanal where they would take a landscape that was just

25:54.978 --> 26:02.105
forest, and they could just flatten that out and make runways that the biggest bombers could land on.

26:02.165 --> 26:09.892
It's almost mind-boggling what the CVs could do with their skills and not a whole lot of equipment, but just with their skills.

26:09.912 --> 26:11.734
It's entirely fascinating.

26:12.875 --> 26:18.360
Well, that sort of thing kind of creates pride in an organization.

26:18.701 --> 26:19.521
Absolutely.

26:19.541 --> 26:23.365
And I've always valued that experience.

26:25.083 --> 26:31.974
Growing up, maybe that's the way to put it, and making some life decisions.

26:32.736 --> 26:42.271
Well, John Blazens, we're out of time, but thank you for your service, and thank you for being here as a proud Navy CB, and thank you to your service to World War II, and a lifelong Brianite.

26:42.311 --> 26:43.934
You helped make the city what it is.

26:44.014 --> 26:44.575
Thank you very much.

26:44.595 --> 26:45.777
Thank you for the opportunity.

26:45.998 --> 26:46.298
All right.

26:46.936 --> 26:51.443
John Blazens and his wife, Madeline, are proud parents of a son and a daughter and three grandchildren.

26:51.483 --> 26:54.168
They live in their home that they built in Bryan in 1960.

26:54.488 --> 27:00.018
The skills that he learned as a Navy Seabee in World War II served him well in his career as a highwayman.

27:00.659 --> 27:05.467
We salute John Blazens and all the proud members of Navy construction battalions who served our country.

27:05.907 --> 27:06.909
And we salute all veterans.

27:07.490 --> 27:08.391
I'm Tom Turbeville.

27:08.411 --> 27:10.615
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
