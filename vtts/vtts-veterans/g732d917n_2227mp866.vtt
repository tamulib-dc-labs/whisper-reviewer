00:01.027 --> 00:25.827
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:26.167 --> 00:27.810
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:28.060 --> 00:30.663
VETERANS ARE ALL AROUND US IN THE BRAZIS VALLEY.

00:30.683 --> 00:39.355
FOR EXAMPLE, ARNOLD FULTERMAN AND HIS WIFE MINNIE HAVE BEEN MARRIED 56 YEARS AND THEY'VE LIVED MOST OF THAT TIME IN THEIR EAST 25TH STREET HOME IN BRIAN.

00:39.935 --> 00:50.429
ARNOLD WORKED 41 YEARS FOR THE PHONE COMPANY BEFORE HE RETIRED, BUT BEFORE ANY OF THAT, HE SERVED AS AN INFANTRYMAN IN PATTON'S 3RD ARMY, 80TH DIVISION, A VETERAN OF THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE.

00:50.529 --> 00:52.752
HE SAW PLENTY IN THE EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.228
just a doughboy fighting for his country.

00:55.608 --> 00:59.112
And it's our pleasure to welcome Arnold Folterman to Veterans of the Valley.

00:59.652 --> 01:03.196
Welcome, PFC Folterman, and thank you very much for your service.

01:03.216 --> 01:04.717
I want to talk about your growing up.

01:04.777 --> 01:07.520
You are a Brazos Valley boy, for sure.

01:07.540 --> 01:13.386
You grew up in Washington County and on a farm between Lyons and Caldwell with your family.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.309
And sort of take us from there and sort of getting into the Army.

01:16.329 --> 01:18.771
You actually went into the Army in 1943, right?

01:18.811 --> 01:22.755
1943, reported for active duty on

01:23.275 --> 01:25.137
July the 5th, 1943.

01:25.177 --> 01:25.898
Uh-huh.

01:26.539 --> 01:29.763
And you went to Fort Sam Houston, as a lot of soldiers back then went.

01:29.783 --> 01:32.887
That was your first exposure to the Army.

01:32.907 --> 01:34.669
Sort of talk about what that was like.

01:34.689 --> 01:38.975
And for a young kid, you were probably a little bit frightened about what you were in for, weren't you?

01:38.995 --> 01:40.937
Well, I just floated along.

01:42.299 --> 01:47.245
And the train ride was the longest I'd ever been on.

01:47.545 --> 01:47.866
Right.

01:47.886 --> 01:49.047
It went all the way to

01:49.567 --> 01:56.637
I think Los Angeles, California, and then we were bused to Camp Callen, California.

01:56.657 --> 01:56.917
Right.

01:56.937 --> 02:00.062
That's where you went to 40 millimeter anti-aircraft training.

02:00.102 --> 02:06.731
I guess they were trying to find the spot where you were going to work best to serve the country, and anti-aircraft was the first.

02:06.751 --> 02:10.917
And then it was just sort of a series of places where you got more training after Camp Callen, right?

02:10.897 --> 02:14.522
Yeah, they had to do something with me.

02:14.623 --> 02:20.772
And so they just put me in that anti-aircraft thing for training.

02:20.792 --> 02:21.273
Right.

02:21.293 --> 02:22.274
Where'd you go after Camp Cali?

02:22.294 --> 02:23.476
You went to Fort Bliss and then where?

02:23.496 --> 02:24.738
Fort Bliss, Texas.

02:24.758 --> 02:27.923
And we spent 16 weeks there.

02:28.624 --> 02:37.637
And after we completed our, and we had infantry training then in half tracks with quad 50 caliber machine guns.

02:37.778 --> 02:38.018
Right.

02:38.757 --> 02:41.902
And then we moved from there to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas.

02:42.062 --> 02:50.255
Talk about the train ride to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas, because then some of the things that you saw on the way, you got kind of close to home, and you didn't even know it, right?

02:50.275 --> 02:50.375
Yeah.

02:51.076 --> 02:57.867
Yeah, I woke up one morning, and we were in some old railroad coaches, and had the windows open.

02:58.488 --> 03:03.736
And I happened to be right in the window, so I leaned out and looked out, and what did I see?

03:03.777 --> 03:05.980
Dime box, Texas.

03:06.888 --> 03:10.692
Then Collowell, Texas, and the train went on to Hearn.

03:10.912 --> 03:11.172
Right.

03:11.192 --> 03:15.316
And we stopped there and had a 30-minute exercise in the freight yards.

03:15.636 --> 03:16.117
I see.

03:16.137 --> 03:17.779
So you were pretty close to home.

03:17.799 --> 03:18.079
Oh, yeah.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.181
Just going from one place to another.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.142
12 miles.

03:21.422 --> 03:23.384
Collowell is about 12 miles from where I live.

03:23.524 --> 03:31.231
Went to Camp Chaffee, spent about 16 weeks there, advanced infantry training, and then finally to Maryland to Camp Miles Standish.

03:31.272 --> 03:35.916
Talk about what you were trained there, what you trained there for before you went over to Europe.

03:36.318 --> 03:40.708
Camp Miles-Stanish, we had an actually

03:40.942 --> 03:51.971
infantry live fire exercise that consisted of actually firing M1 rifles as we advanced one squad over the other squad.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.334
And it was quite an experience.

03:55.634 --> 03:56.295
I bet it was.

03:56.315 --> 04:01.379
I wonder why we hadn't shot up half of our group, but they had it worked out pretty well.

04:01.619 --> 04:02.580
Indeed.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.363
And then you went overseas and that was an experience in itself.

04:06.424 --> 04:10.527
I know that there were a lot of people that went over to Europe and they had the pleasure of

04:10.507 --> 04:16.541
being in some converted nice boats, but you didn't.

04:16.561 --> 04:17.924
You were on an old freighter.

04:18.004 --> 04:19.207
Is that right, going into 10 days?

04:19.227 --> 04:22.214
It was a combination freighter and troop transport.

04:22.374 --> 04:24.499
About 500 men?

04:24.800 --> 04:34.456
It was, I think, around 500 men that they had down in the hole of that ship, and air conditioning and the air system wasn't too good, and everybody was seasick.

04:34.496 --> 04:36.579
Oh, my goodness.

04:36.599 --> 04:45.194
And the smell of hot, smelly, greasy smell coming out of that kitchen would just make you sick before you ever got there.

04:45.254 --> 04:47.938
I don't think I ate over two meals after I got on it.

04:48.104 --> 04:51.890
So you had 10 days of that, 10 days because you were actually in a naval convoy, is that right?

04:51.910 --> 04:52.190
Yeah, right.

04:52.932 --> 04:56.217
Yeah, so you must have felt like you were already in combat just going overseas.

04:56.577 --> 04:58.000
Well, I felt terrible.

04:58.020 --> 05:04.951
After you left the States, I know you told me the other day that you pretty much lost.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.593
You just sort of went wherever they took you.

05:06.613 --> 05:07.795
You landed somewhere in England.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.317
You're not sure where.

05:09.337 --> 05:14.145
But it was there that you met up with the 80th Division, and then that's where you were.

05:14.395 --> 05:15.718
in England before you went?

05:16.058 --> 05:19.806
No, I was in a replacement depot.

05:20.407 --> 05:28.042
Then we boarded a ship and crossed the English Channel and disembarked into the landing craft and landed on Omaha Beach.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.547
Of course, it was already secured at that time.

05:31.188 --> 05:36.218
From there, we were trucked to an assembly point close to La Harve.

05:36.198 --> 05:44.450
And from there, we were put in groups and then sent out as a replacement to certain divisions.

05:44.590 --> 05:45.992
And I happened to wind up in the 80th.

05:46.052 --> 05:47.454
And that's where you wound up in the 80th.

05:47.474 --> 05:50.078
So I got you in the 80th a little bit too early.

05:50.458 --> 05:55.405
Talk about the crossing of the English Channel and going into Omaha Beach, did you?

05:55.840 --> 06:04.260
You all had already known at the time about D-Day and what was up, the invasion of Normandy, and this was going to be the last push towards the end of the war in Europe.

06:04.681 --> 06:08.671
But did you know specifically what you were going to be doing once you got to France?

06:08.972 --> 06:09.513
No.

06:09.533 --> 06:10.175
No.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.781
No, I just knew I'd be in an infantry outfit somewhere.

06:13.001 --> 06:13.242
Right.

06:13.576 --> 06:18.202
I had no idea as to what division or anything like that.

06:18.222 --> 06:18.663
Yeah.

06:18.683 --> 06:23.549
It was about that time after you got over there that you took what turned out to be your last shower for a while, right?

06:24.350 --> 06:24.470
Yeah.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.472
Last bath, excuse me.

06:25.492 --> 06:33.302
No, that was a bath in a stream in a farmer's field.

06:33.462 --> 06:34.183
Right.

06:34.163 --> 06:35.707
Cold water.

06:35.727 --> 06:39.077
They divided us into company strengths.

06:39.759 --> 06:49.185
So there was a whole company of GIs out there in the nude in this cold water taking a bath before.

06:49.165 --> 06:50.547
But it was refreshing.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.608
Yeah, I bet it was.

06:51.628 --> 06:55.934
Yeah, and if you'd known it was the last one you were going to have for a while, you'd have known how refreshing.

06:56.335 --> 07:03.245
I know you wrote a story about your service in Europe, and one thing that you wrote was about the dead cows.

07:03.525 --> 07:03.745
Yeah.

07:03.785 --> 07:04.526
You wrote about that.

07:04.586 --> 07:07.731
Talk about that and what that was all about.

07:07.811 --> 07:12.137
Well, I couldn't figure why there were so many dead cows laying around.

07:12.157 --> 07:18.025
They were big Holstein, dairy-type cows that had been killed, but...

07:18.528 --> 07:28.261
At night, sometimes the Germans had used cows to infiltrate our lines.

07:28.482 --> 07:34.250
Well, after this development, well, they just, whenever there was something going on out there, they would call in an artillery strike.

07:34.810 --> 07:38.315
And poor old cows was the ones that got in the way.

07:38.435 --> 07:41.419
Got most of the damage.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.382
Right, right, because at night.

07:43.663 --> 07:44.344
You couldn't see.

07:44.444 --> 07:48.349
They didn't know whether it was personnel, whether it was troops or

07:49.105 --> 07:51.069
Sometimes it turned out to be cattle, right?

07:51.089 --> 07:54.054
And that was the blackest nights I've ever seen in my life.

07:54.114 --> 07:58.101
You could almost touch your nose before you could see your hand.

07:58.121 --> 07:58.362
Wow.

07:59.284 --> 08:02.369
Your job there was in ammunition and a pioneer platoon.

08:02.429 --> 08:03.351
What was a pioneer platoon?

08:03.567 --> 08:11.487
It was actually a miniature engineering platoon that did the dirty work.

08:12.249 --> 08:12.890
Digging ditches.

08:13.191 --> 08:13.773
Digging ditches.

08:14.214 --> 08:15.136
Packing stuff around.

08:15.738 --> 08:16.379
Piggybacking.

08:17.181 --> 08:19.467
Packed muleing wherever they needed stuff to go.

08:19.447 --> 08:19.807
Right.

08:19.828 --> 08:29.982
Now, this is a unit I understand that before you got there had one of the reasons they needed replacement because they had been under pretty heavy attack and it had some significant casualties.

08:30.102 --> 08:36.811
Yes, at Pontemuson Hill, the regiment battalion suffered pretty heavy casualties.

08:36.831 --> 08:39.154
That's the reason that we went in there.

08:39.174 --> 08:40.476
Right, right.

08:40.456 --> 08:45.925
After this, I believe you moved to the Seal River, crossed the Seal River, and you were pretty much in a defensive mode, sort of?

08:45.965 --> 08:47.408
Talk about what you were doing.

08:47.548 --> 08:48.930
Before we crossed the Seal.

08:49.030 --> 08:52.476
We crossed the Moselle, but we had not crossed the Seal River.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.057
I understand.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.743
And we sat for about 10 days, I think.

08:56.723 --> 09:06.436
on the west side of the Seal River while they brought in supplies and stuff and replenished the troops that we had lost again.

09:06.456 --> 09:10.481
And then we moved out to cross the Seal River.

09:11.602 --> 09:23.458
And when we got orders to cross the Seal River, we moved out and we waded water for most of the night.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.380
It was about a mile long.

09:25.917 --> 09:32.134
and that water was anywhere from ankle deep to armpit deep.

09:32.174 --> 09:35.623
But we stayed on a little road that we could see

09:36.262 --> 09:39.605
the outline of a roadway fence.

09:40.466 --> 09:48.755
And we had one little short guy that he had to hold on to the tall guys because his pack would pick him up and float him off.

09:50.817 --> 10:02.168
But anyway, we got there and we surprised the Germans because they didn't think we would move out in weather conditions like that.

10:02.148 --> 10:27.447
and you're getting pretty close to winter time so i imagine that going across that river was pretty cold it was it was cold oh yeah it was cold you're talking about what november november somewhere first parts from the first part of november right seventh or eighth or somewhere along right in uh 1944 right right where this is before uh you move on to luxembourg and the battle of the falls but before that you told a story about i believe one of your uh

10:27.713 --> 10:37.703
Captain Chitwood had asked you to go along to inspect a cemetery and a church tower, a church bell tower.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.505
Sort of talk about that and what that was about.

10:39.625 --> 10:44.330
Well, we had moved into this town and as we got into the town it was getting dark.

10:44.770 --> 10:53.239
By the time it got dark, we got in a bunch of artillery or mortar fire or something.

10:53.259 --> 10:54.520
It was pretty heavy.

10:55.461 --> 10:56.522
Anyway, it was

10:56.840 --> 11:00.205
It was pretty well localized in one area of the town.

11:01.106 --> 11:10.799
And somebody figured out that, well, they had an artillery spotter somewhere, and it wasn't anything falling close to this church or cemetery.

11:11.360 --> 11:19.371
So Captain Chitwood was the commanding officer of the I&R Platoon and Reconnaissance

11:19.351 --> 11:21.794
Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon.

11:22.234 --> 11:27.080
I don't know why he came and got me, but he got me and we went out and went all through the cemetery.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.743
And those cemeteries had big crypts and stuff.

11:29.763 --> 11:32.386
And we went around and checked all the doors on that.

11:32.726 --> 11:41.576
And then he went up into the bell tower of the church while I was posted on guard at the base of the stairway.

11:42.477 --> 11:44.760
But there was nobody there.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.962
But then I found out why the next morning.

11:48.275 --> 11:58.056
In the meantime, the field artillery, some field artillery unit, was bringing in a humongous artillery piece.

11:58.076 --> 12:04.410
It was a 280-millimeter gun, and they were setting that thing up

12:06.027 --> 12:30.364
outside of this town well we went back to where we was in the buildings and the next morning before daybreak well they fired that thing oh my goodness and it just literally blew the roof off of the building that we was in we thought we done had it again yes sir but it that the gun they tell me was capable of firing this 280 millimeter

12:31.846 --> 12:35.950
projectile, a distance of approximately 30 miles.

12:36.170 --> 12:37.592
Right, right, right.

12:38.413 --> 12:41.856
I want to go back after you backtrack a little bit.

12:42.096 --> 12:49.264
After you crossed the Moselle River, you said that there was an incident at that time where your truck had gotten bogged down.

12:49.324 --> 13:00.415
It had been raining quite a bit, got bogged down in the mud, and you thought that was one of the scarier times for you because you thought that you might have been ahead at that time.

13:00.675 --> 13:01.296
Talk about

13:01.647 --> 13:03.349
That and what your thoughts were again.

13:03.370 --> 13:10.420
Well, we usually didn't try to bring vehicles into the towns.

13:10.440 --> 13:18.211
They'd try to conceal them in the woods or something, and they turned off the highway just before we got into this little town of Brat, France.

13:18.231 --> 13:18.351
Right.

13:18.852 --> 13:26.323
And the driver got up a ways in the mud, and then his truck stalled, and he couldn't go forward anymore.

13:27.124 --> 13:31.030
And in the meantime, the Germans decided that was a prime target,

13:31.668 --> 13:33.751
And it was just me and the old truck driver there.

13:33.972 --> 13:40.943
And the motor pool officer's jeep driver was down on the road.

13:40.963 --> 13:48.896
Well, the truck driver was wounded, but he was able to back his truck out of there and take it on down into the town.

13:48.916 --> 13:51.841
Well, the jeep driver lost his life out there on the road.

13:52.923 --> 13:55.988
And that was...

13:56.305 --> 14:02.460
Pretty weird feeling because you didn't know which way to go, whether you should run forward, backwards, or sideways.

14:02.641 --> 14:02.923
Right.

14:03.443 --> 14:08.849
And I finally went back to the town and joined up with my group that was in town.

14:08.929 --> 14:12.533
And your truck had been set on fire and inside of it was your only pair of breeches, right?

14:12.553 --> 14:13.734
That's right, yeah.

14:13.754 --> 14:16.397
Everything else I had, I didn't have anything.

14:16.417 --> 14:19.540
So you wore the same pair of pants for what, about three months or so?

14:19.560 --> 14:23.385
Yeah, just about from September, well, longer than that.

14:23.445 --> 14:28.350
When I left England, all the way till the 6th of December.

14:28.610 --> 14:32.995
Right, because the 6th of December was when you got a little bit of a break, you'd been

14:33.059 --> 14:35.986
in enemy contact for 102 straight days.

14:36.367 --> 14:40.175
So you went to a town in France and got fresh clothes and you finally got a shower, right?

14:40.196 --> 14:40.857
That's right.

14:40.877 --> 14:41.639
That must have felt good.

14:41.799 --> 14:42.240
Oh, it did.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.826
Probably your most memorable shower, right?

14:44.846 --> 14:49.457
Shortest five minutes I ever spent in my life because that's all the time we were having that shower.

14:49.477 --> 14:50.359
That's all the time you had.

14:50.339 --> 14:56.851
But then you got orders to go to Luxembourg, and that meant what you would soon or later find out would be the Battle of the Bulge.

14:57.532 --> 15:03.544
When I have spoken to veterans who were involved in the Battle of the Bulge, the first thing they talk about is the weather, and they talk about how cold it was.

15:03.564 --> 15:06.289
They say it is the coldest that they have ever been before or since.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.054
I assume you would agree with that, right?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.356
I sure do.

15:10.597 --> 15:10.797
Yeah.

15:11.699 --> 15:13.883
How'd you keep yourself from freezing?

15:14.302 --> 15:32.185
We had orders to go and relieve another infantry division, but while we were in transit into their positions and they were coming out, orders were changed, and we loaded back on the quartermaster trucks, and it was drizzling rain, as it usually did over there.

15:33.367 --> 15:38.594
We loaded on these trucks, and, well, we didn't know where it was going or nothing.

15:38.614 --> 15:40.856
Just get back on the trucks.

15:40.876 --> 15:43.600
And so when we got all loaded up,

15:45.098 --> 15:49.343
The order came down from truck driver to truck driver.

15:49.383 --> 15:52.707
He turned on full headlights on all trucks.

15:52.727 --> 15:56.651
And we hadn't seen a bright light in eight months, 10 months or longer.

15:57.692 --> 16:07.183
And that prompted some real comments as to what they thought General Patton was trying to kill all of us.

16:07.684 --> 16:10.667
But in the finale, it was a good move

16:10.647 --> 16:19.041
because he knew that there was a big snowstorm coming, that the Germans couldn't fly and observe us or anything.

16:19.702 --> 16:24.950
So that's the reason he had the truck driver turn on the lights and he could move that convoy out.

16:25.752 --> 16:30.399
Yeah, and he went 150 miles in 10 hours, which was moving for a convoy that size, right?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.082
Yeah, full division, yeah.

16:32.062 --> 16:34.024
And you wouldn't have been able to do that without the lights.

16:34.084 --> 16:36.066
Without the lights, no, we never would have made it.

16:36.247 --> 16:36.647
Right.

16:36.667 --> 16:49.721
And that gave us an opportunity to get into position in Luxembourg where we should be at least a day ahead of what the Germans had anticipated that we would be there.

16:49.961 --> 16:50.462
Right.

16:50.482 --> 16:56.529
So we were sitting there waiting for them, ready when the artillery had zeroed in on the roads and all that stuff.

16:56.869 --> 16:56.989
Right.

16:57.560 --> 17:10.894
Arnold, I asked you the other day if you were wounded in World War II, and you told me about something very superficial, but you said that you went to a first aid station, and what you found there, you just decided just to turn around and go away.

17:11.214 --> 17:13.736
Sorry to talk about that.

17:15.198 --> 17:16.539
I wasn't that bad off.

17:16.559 --> 17:16.760
Yeah.

17:17.540 --> 17:17.801
Yeah.

17:18.201 --> 17:20.904
You had just in your back, you'd been burned by something.

17:21.184 --> 17:21.464
Yeah.

17:21.484 --> 17:22.265
You're not sure what?

17:22.606 --> 17:25.549
Something penetrated in the deep blood.

17:25.589 --> 17:26.550
I don't know what it was.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.010
Right.

17:27.277 --> 17:33.957
But you went to the first aid station and you found, you realized immediately that compared to what you were seeing there that you weren't bad off.

17:33.977 --> 17:36.646
So you just turned around and went back about your duty.

17:36.666 --> 17:37.127
Yeah, I left.

17:37.508 --> 17:38.130
And you just left.

17:38.397 --> 17:43.623
I know that that's a time, obviously, that you remember and you'll recall.

17:44.884 --> 17:45.365
Let's move on.

17:45.385 --> 17:47.988
I want to look at some photographs now, if we can.

17:48.028 --> 17:52.733
Some pictures that you gave us to use here that are in your home.

17:52.753 --> 17:56.758
And some of the things we're going to see a picture of, we're going to be talking about in a little bit.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.220
And you can see a photograph right there.

17:58.260 --> 18:03.005
There is a young, raw Arnold Folterman.

18:03.025 --> 18:03.626
When was this taken?

18:03.646 --> 18:06.629
This was taken, actually, I guess, during your training, right?

18:06.649 --> 18:08.151
It was probably around...

18:08.789 --> 18:09.069
1943?

18:10.891 --> 18:12.894
August sometime in 43, I guess.

18:13.034 --> 18:13.334
Right.

18:13.454 --> 18:17.860
Just a young, well-shaven, about to go.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.021
I didn't have to shave.

18:19.061 --> 18:20.082
Didn't have to shave back then.

18:20.102 --> 18:22.044
I just rubbed pretty hard with a washcloth.

18:23.646 --> 18:24.828
Well, that's a fine-looking soldier.

18:25.028 --> 18:26.930
Okay, let's move on to the next photograph.

18:27.811 --> 18:28.852
Look at this picture here.

18:28.892 --> 18:31.195
This is a U and a G. Where was this taken from?

18:31.215 --> 18:32.957
This is Maherkirchen, Austria.

18:33.022 --> 18:33.523
Uh-huh.

18:33.544 --> 18:34.306
This is later on.

18:34.326 --> 18:43.312
We're going to be talking about this because later on after the Battle of the Bulge, you move to Austria.

18:43.332 --> 18:43.633
Okay.

18:44.134 --> 18:45.478
Move on to the next photograph.

18:46.015 --> 18:51.462
We're going to talk about this and the German surrender as the war was coming to an end.

18:51.482 --> 18:52.863
Isn't that what we're looking at right there?

18:53.084 --> 18:53.344
Right.

18:53.404 --> 18:59.752
That is a collection of the stuff that they brought with them when they surrendered.

19:00.032 --> 19:03.136
The 6th German Army surrendered to our 3rd Army.

19:03.336 --> 19:03.857
Right.

19:03.877 --> 19:14.250
And they brought their vehicles and military equipment, and they were parked out in these valleys at Meierkirk in Austria.

19:14.332 --> 19:16.095
Wow, that's quite a sight right there.

19:16.115 --> 19:17.557
That's just a small part of it.

19:17.577 --> 19:18.419
Just a small part of it.

19:18.439 --> 19:19.681
Just a very small part of it.

19:19.761 --> 19:20.061
Okay.

19:20.903 --> 19:21.223
Move on.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.685
We've got another one.

19:23.166 --> 19:23.787
Talk about this.

19:23.827 --> 19:26.492
This is towards the end of the year, and this is some of your buddies.

19:26.512 --> 19:32.040
You're not in this picture, but this is some of your buddies kind of celebrating the impending end of the conflict.

19:32.221 --> 19:39.833
That's right after we received the orders to cease all the...

19:40.775 --> 19:43.798
All hostilities.

19:44.078 --> 19:45.580
All hostilities would cease.

19:45.960 --> 19:50.865
And the fellow on the left had found himself a stovepipe.

19:50.985 --> 19:53.107
I never did learn what the guy's name was.

19:54.969 --> 19:58.092
That's true in a lot of the cases.

19:58.112 --> 20:04.219
You didn't know what the guy's name was because he didn't go into formation for roll call or anything.

20:04.919 --> 20:06.221
But he was from Alabama.

20:06.941 --> 20:08.723
That's what he went by, Alabama.

20:08.821 --> 20:09.362
Alabama.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.023
Alabama.

20:10.103 --> 20:11.626
He was Alabama.

20:11.646 --> 20:20.642
Okay, we've got a picture now from, actually, you go back, this is from your early training at Camp Callen, California, and this is actually just a section of a much wider picture.

20:20.722 --> 20:29.457
This is probably only about a fourth of the people that were in that training group at Camp Callen, and you were sitting, bottom, almost the center.

20:29.497 --> 20:31.681
You can see the black dot there, and that's you.

20:32.002 --> 20:33.985
That's me.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.287
It wasn't much of me.

20:35.307 --> 20:36.889
I was a skinny kid.

20:37.490 --> 20:41.756
You're a skinny kid, but they were probably going to take care of that, for sure.

20:42.177 --> 20:43.379
Remember when that picture was taken?

20:43.499 --> 20:49.488
That was in probably August, latter part of August.

20:49.528 --> 20:53.854
We just, I think, had completed our basic training there in the 40 millimeter.

20:54.555 --> 20:55.556
Of 1943?

20:55.576 --> 20:56.297
Of 1943, yeah.

20:56.878 --> 21:01.525
But I mean, I guess you can go back in your thoughts and probably remember assembling for that photograph, right?

21:02.045 --> 21:04.910
And the fancy camera that took that wide, wide picture.

21:05.271 --> 21:06.513
Well, no, I can't.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.879
You can't deal with that many people together that early.

21:09.899 --> 21:12.905
No, we were in so many formations.

21:12.965 --> 21:13.366
Right.

21:13.386 --> 21:16.471
And the ones I hated the worst was battalion parades.

21:16.511 --> 21:17.453
Exactly.

21:18.034 --> 21:18.535
Exactly.

21:19.088 --> 21:19.549
Okay, move on.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.611
We've got one more picture, and this is of your grandson.

21:22.312 --> 21:22.612
Yes, sir.

21:22.993 --> 21:25.195
Tell us his name and what he is doing right now.

21:25.716 --> 21:42.717
It's Scott Fulton, and he's nearing the end of his training in the Marine Corps, and he is now in the training of what is equivalent to the Navy SEAL training.

21:42.937 --> 21:45.921
It's a specialized group of boys.

21:46.241 --> 21:46.481
Right.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.724
Well, I know you're very proud of him.

21:50.020 --> 21:50.981
Indeed.

21:51.142 --> 21:55.789
I know you have 11 grandchildren and one great grandchild.

21:55.809 --> 22:11.573
We'll talk about your family a little bit later, but let's go ahead and get, we were talking about some of the pictures and sort of where you went after you left the Battle of the Bulge in France, and you just sort of moved around and around, and you ended up in Austria, I know, and also in Nuremberg.

22:12.014 --> 22:18.424
So sort of take us your travels after France and where you went from one place to the other, and especially in Austria.

22:19.636 --> 22:26.724
Nuremberg, we just kind of passed through that and getting ready to relieve some other infantry division.

22:27.485 --> 22:32.551
And from there, I think we went actually and made a river crossing in Brown Isle, Austria.

22:32.812 --> 22:33.673
Right.

22:33.693 --> 22:38.699
And that was the weirdest river crossing I ever... This was Hitler's birthplace.

22:39.099 --> 22:40.481
It was Adolf's birthplace.

22:40.641 --> 22:48.090
And when we got there, the burgemeister had the whole town fall out

22:48.374 --> 22:53.380
and greet us on the opposite banks of the Inns River.

22:55.822 --> 22:57.905
Just opened the gates.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.729
There was no hostility to whatever.

23:02.350 --> 23:05.593
Just coming down to the end of the war.

23:05.713 --> 23:11.800
And I know later that you went to another place in Austria and actually

23:11.780 --> 23:15.869
some German troops were surrendering to you all.

23:15.889 --> 23:17.151
They were anxious to surrender.

23:17.272 --> 23:23.385
They wanted to surrender because that was sort of their safe haven from the Russians who were still carrying out the hostilities.

23:23.605 --> 23:31.442
Yeah, after Austria and at the end of the war, we pulled back to Brownau.

23:31.692 --> 23:35.421
And that's when the German 6th Army surrendered.

23:36.423 --> 23:47.310
And we sit there for about three days, I guess, and did nothing but guide traffic to bring these soldiers into a certain area.

23:47.490 --> 23:47.811
Right.

23:47.791 --> 23:51.341
Then after that, we'd process them.

23:52.123 --> 23:57.819
And one of my duties was to see that they all got a burr haircut.

23:58.842 --> 24:02.813
I confiscated all knives, cameras.

24:02.793 --> 24:04.336
Went through their baggage.

24:04.416 --> 24:17.143
Went through their baggage and then saw that they were dusted for life before they would be moved on to another station and shipped back to wherever they sent them to.

24:17.384 --> 24:17.765
Indeed.

24:17.965 --> 24:18.526
Indeed.

24:18.647 --> 24:19.869
So that was a part of your job.

24:19.889 --> 24:20.751
And I know that...

24:20.731 --> 24:25.015
Later on, you went to another place, I believe, in Austria to where you got treated pretty well.

24:25.035 --> 24:29.961
You were in a high-rise hotel until the army found out how much it was costing them to keep you there, right?

24:29.981 --> 24:34.145
Yeah, that was after we finished discharging all the Germans.

24:34.165 --> 24:36.467
They moved us to Czechoslovakia.

24:36.928 --> 24:41.152
And the Marian, what we called it, Mariansky-Lazny.

24:41.393 --> 24:41.693
Right.

24:41.853 --> 24:45.156
Marianbad, English pronunciation.

24:45.717 --> 24:50.502
And the town was made up of 26 high-rise hotels.

24:50.482 --> 24:53.167
And they were not damaged at all during the war.

24:54.129 --> 24:56.513
And we stayed in those for about a month.

24:56.714 --> 25:04.008
And then somebody figured it was a little too expensive for you to be treated that way.

25:04.028 --> 25:06.933
So they moved us out to an old beat-up PW camp.

25:07.133 --> 25:09.538
Well, it was nice while it lasted, right?

25:09.558 --> 25:09.738
Oh, yeah.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.600
I enjoyed it.

25:11.204 --> 25:16.152
Later on, you went to another town that was actually housed a Hitler Youth School.

25:16.252 --> 25:16.553
Right.

25:16.573 --> 25:17.895
It was a Hitler Youth School.

25:18.115 --> 25:18.336
Right.

25:18.636 --> 25:18.856
Right.

25:18.877 --> 25:21.060
But it had been being used for something else.

25:21.160 --> 25:21.701
Is that right?

25:21.781 --> 25:24.245
Or it was a youth school at the time?

25:24.546 --> 25:25.748
That's what we were using it for.

25:25.768 --> 25:27.090
Oh, that's what you were using it for.

25:27.130 --> 25:27.370
Right.

25:27.771 --> 25:28.071
I see.

25:28.132 --> 25:28.392
Yeah.

25:29.374 --> 25:33.921
Adolf had a school for his underlings, you know.

25:33.901 --> 25:37.307
youngster that he was training for military and stuff.

25:37.707 --> 25:41.714
So it was set up, an ideal set up for an infantry unit.

25:42.616 --> 25:44.559
Arlie, you finally got to go home in late 1945.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.903
You were discharged in January of 1946.

25:47.224 --> 25:52.753
You finally got to Caldwell, but it was late one night, and where'd you spend your first night at home?

25:52.852 --> 26:00.180
No, I spent the first night sleeping on the Santa Fe Railroad.

26:02.242 --> 26:03.504
On the bench at the train station.

26:03.524 --> 26:04.325
At the train station.

26:04.365 --> 26:04.885
In Caldwell.

26:04.925 --> 26:06.427
Because there's no buses running.

26:07.228 --> 26:08.249
I didn't know anybody.

26:09.490 --> 26:10.471
It was a dry place.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.232
Welcome home.

26:12.614 --> 26:12.934
Thank you.

26:12.954 --> 26:15.657
But then you went on home to Lyons the next day.

26:15.757 --> 26:17.599
The next morning I called a bus out.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.420
The next morning.

26:18.400 --> 26:25.228
You worked at a grocery in Lyons and then eventually at a service station just right here in Bryan around Texas and 30th Street for a while.

26:25.248 --> 26:25.748
Is that right?

26:26.349 --> 26:30.294
And then you worked for the telephone company for a year.

26:30.314 --> 26:31.335
We've got about a minute left.

26:31.375 --> 26:33.197
I want you to talk about your family.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.439
You and Manny, like we said, have been married for 56 years.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.683
And I know that you've had four children.

26:38.703 --> 26:42.267
You tragically lost your oldest daughter, Karen, about seven years ago.

26:43.409 --> 26:45.551
But you have two sons and another daughter.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.293
Who are they and what do they do?

26:47.695 --> 26:51.681
My oldest son, Keith, lives in Robertson County.

26:51.721 --> 26:58.852
He worked for the state as a game warden for around 24, 25 years.

26:59.734 --> 27:03.860
He retired, and now he's working for the Sheriff's Department in Robertson County.

27:03.880 --> 27:04.962
Right, and another son?

27:05.583 --> 27:10.934
Kirby works at Texas Digitals College Station.

27:10.954 --> 27:11.194
Right.

27:11.495 --> 27:13.760
Don't ask me what Texas Digitals is.

27:13.780 --> 27:14.962
And you've got a daughter, Kim, right?

27:15.062 --> 27:15.182
Kim.

27:15.403 --> 27:17.126
And she works at First National Bank.

27:17.327 --> 27:18.970
Works at First National Bank.

27:19.531 --> 27:19.912
All right.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.818
I know you're proud of them and the 11 grandchildren and the great-grandchild.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.622
And thank you for your service.

27:24.642 --> 27:25.363
We're out of time.

27:25.563 --> 27:26.164
Thank you.

27:26.184 --> 27:26.604
Thank you.

27:27.365 --> 27:34.653
Arnold Folterman's story is the most common type of those young men who gave their most vital years to serve our country and came home.

27:34.673 --> 27:41.941
He followed orders, risked his life almost daily, served alongside others who lost theirs, and wonders why his was spared.

27:41.961 --> 27:45.525
We salute Arnold Folterman of Bryan for his service as we do all veterans.

27:46.085 --> 27:49.309
I'm Tom Turbeville, and join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.298
All right, I'm ready whenever they say.

28:34.439 --> 28:36.322
Okay, here we go.

28:37.523 --> 28:38.945
We're going for 30 seconds here, right?

28:40.127 --> 28:45.574
Okay.

28:45.594 --> 28:49.138
The doughboys of World War II just did their job, did it well.

28:49.679 --> 28:59.492
Arnold Fulterman of Bryan was one of those, serving Patton's Third Army as a member of the 80th Infantry Division, a soldier on the ground in defense of his country.

28:59.945 --> 29:04.460
Hi, I'm Tom Turbyville, and I want you to meet Arnold Fulterman on Veterans of the Valley.

29:04.982 --> 29:10.461
It's Friday at 8.30, Saturday and Sunday at 6.30, right here on KAMU-TV.
