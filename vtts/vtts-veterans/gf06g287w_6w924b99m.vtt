00:02.967 --> 00:09.501
Thank you.

01:19.495 --> 01:26.802
who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

01:27.083 --> 01:35.792
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

01:36.172 --> 01:48.945
First National Bank, first always.

01:52.604 --> 02:09.248
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

02:09.268 --> 02:10.410
I'm Tom Turbeville.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.370
We're going to stray a little bit out of the box, as they say, today on Veterans of the Valley.

02:15.830 --> 02:25.683
Dr. Philip Alexander is not a veteran, but has indeed found a way, a remarkable way, to express his passion for those who have served through his talent as an artist.

02:25.703 --> 02:33.994
As you can read on his website, he was into pencil drawings in the 80s and the 90s, but then late in the 90s, his medium became computer art.

02:34.014 --> 02:38.220
And what extraordinary art he has produced, and you're going to see a good sampling of it today.

02:38.538 --> 02:45.828
Dr. Philip Alexander has been a physician in the Brazos Valley since 1974, and we welcome him to Veterans of the Valley.

02:45.848 --> 02:51.296
Dr. Alexander, I've been wanting to do this show for a long, long time because I'm such a fan of what you do and your art.

02:51.376 --> 02:54.961
But before we talk about the art, we're going to go in a completely different direction.

02:54.981 --> 02:57.023
I want to talk about of your many skills.

02:57.184 --> 03:00.248
You are an oboist and you have been since you were 13.

03:00.288 --> 03:03.252
You played with the Brazos Valley Symphony for 25 years.

03:03.332 --> 03:06.216
Talk a little bit about sort of that part of your career as a musician.

03:07.310 --> 03:15.565
Well, I went to undergraduate school at a music school in Philadelphia and then taught oboe for a year at Texas Tech.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.928
And then went to medical school and training and moved here.

03:20.948 --> 03:24.052
And you're right, 25 years with the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.114
25 good years.

03:25.274 --> 03:25.975
25 good years.

03:25.995 --> 03:26.777
25 long years.

03:27.798 --> 03:34.889
Matter of fact, I saw that even, I guess, in your youth, you played at the Mormon Tabernacle and even played at the White House for President Kennedy.

03:34.909 --> 03:35.490
Is that right?

03:35.510 --> 03:41.299
Yes, played for Kennedy in 1962 and in 1980 was invited to play a recital.

03:41.279 --> 03:45.548
at the Mormon Tabernacle, and their organist, Robert Kundich, accompanied me.

03:46.028 --> 03:47.812
It was a wonderful experience.

03:47.832 --> 03:50.898
Let's talk about your art and tell us how you got into art.

03:50.978 --> 03:52.261
Obviously, you had a talent for it.

03:52.381 --> 03:53.503
You had a knack for it.

03:53.523 --> 03:57.772
You were into pencil drawings initially, and then you got into the computer art.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.355
Sort of talk about how you got into that.

03:59.386 --> 04:08.865
Well, in the 80s, this is all my wife's fault because in the 80s for Christmas, she gave me the book by Betty Edwards called Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.749
And I thought that was cool.

04:10.829 --> 04:14.657
So I tried that and then the pencil career got started.

04:15.959 --> 04:19.386
And then we had an early Macintosh.

04:19.872 --> 04:25.630
And just the fact that you could make bricks and a brick wall and a house and chimneys was sort of cool.

04:25.691 --> 04:26.613
And then erase it all.

04:27.857 --> 04:33.696
And then things evolved and computers were purchased and thrown away and here we are.

04:34.064 --> 04:40.673
I tell you what, we're going to talk about your technique and sort of how you do without giving away the complete secret of how you do it, but a little bit later.

04:41.013 --> 04:46.741
But let's go ahead and take a look at the first group of pictures because we've got about 28, 30 pictures to look at today.

04:47.001 --> 04:49.324
So we're going to get right to it and look at the first 10 pictures.

04:49.344 --> 04:53.270
So let's go ahead and I'm going to let you comment on each one of these.

04:53.410 --> 04:56.734
And let's go ahead and go to the first one right now.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.976
And here we go.

04:58.136 --> 04:59.498
I think we're about to go to the first picture.

05:04.152 --> 05:05.092
It looks just like me.

05:05.256 --> 05:06.012
Yes it does.

05:07.409 --> 05:07.990
Here we go.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.291
Okay.

05:09.331 --> 05:09.912
Talk about this one.

05:09.952 --> 05:11.815
This was a B-29 at sunset.

05:12.636 --> 05:12.876
Yeah.

05:12.896 --> 05:21.087
These are two B-29s and I wanted them really high and the sun is low in the sky.

05:21.427 --> 05:24.451
Great shadows, great reflections.

05:25.592 --> 05:30.579
And again, when I do these things, I'm there.

05:30.739 --> 05:33.102
I can see these before I start doing them.

05:33.122 --> 05:34.564
I know the angles that I want.

05:35.185 --> 05:39.475
and where I am and where the other planes and ships are.

05:40.076 --> 05:43.404
So this is, they've flown a long way.

05:43.484 --> 05:44.646
They have a long way to go.

05:44.727 --> 05:45.508
They're tired.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.513
It's gonna be a great sunset.

05:48.575 --> 05:50.820
All right, let's move on to picture two.

05:50.881 --> 05:52.384
This is a B-36 mission.

05:52.364 --> 05:54.907
Yeah, this is a B-36.

05:54.927 --> 06:00.214
I sort of envisioned that this, and I don't remember what the range on these things were, but they were thousands of miles.

06:02.317 --> 06:04.600
One of our first truly intercontinental bombers.

06:05.681 --> 06:18.237
And I think on the website it says that this was, I had envisioned this just flying over Greenland and then he's making the slow turn to come back to his home base.

06:18.706 --> 06:23.253
large ships, six pusher props, and four turbojets.

06:23.494 --> 06:24.656
Wow.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.898
The detail is just amazing.

06:26.539 --> 06:27.180
I love this one.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.163
This is a B-29 bombing run.

06:29.503 --> 06:30.645
Yeah.

06:30.665 --> 06:36.515
Obviously, unloading its bombs high over wherever you want it to be.

06:37.937 --> 06:44.848
Most of those were used in the Pacific, so I would imagine somewhere over on one of the islands or Japan itself.

06:46.550 --> 06:49.454
Next picture, we're going to come a little bit more modern day than World War II.

06:49.514 --> 06:50.876
This is called Blastoff.

06:50.916 --> 06:51.817
Great title.

06:51.837 --> 06:51.997
Yeah.

06:52.618 --> 07:10.742
And my technical expertise is not terrific on these, but this is how I envision it after most of the atmosphere is gone and all the smoke and plumes and just before the shuttle engines itself take over.

07:10.962 --> 07:14.667
So high up, just a tad of a curvature on the earth.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.213
Exactly.

07:18.233 --> 07:18.834
What detail.

07:19.195 --> 07:20.617
This one's called Cobra Patrol.

07:21.980 --> 07:24.885
And this is the Cobra attack helicopter.

07:26.447 --> 07:30.194
Again, you can see the two pilots inside.

07:31.155 --> 07:33.119
This one was technically difficulty.

07:33.159 --> 07:39.169
I don't mean to be complaining about my problems, but to show motion in...

07:39.622 --> 08:01.157
rotating props for me was difficult and you can see the the yellow tips of the blades and and all of that hardware up around the the central portion of the of the rotor but i tried to give good motion as well as correct i think correct technical detail on the armaments and the the layout of the machine

08:01.913 --> 08:24.175
your eye goes straight to the to the chopper obviously first but then you look at the detail in the background just the subtlety of the mountains the the snow in the valley there on the right side of the mountains that's just uh well and just amazing and i might add these are all done from scratch and and i spent just as much or more time on the clouds and the mountains are

08:24.155 --> 08:29.245
the ones we'll see in a little while, the ocean, as any of the main subjects.

08:29.405 --> 08:35.397
I would think that the star of the print is probably not as difficult as, like I say, the subtlety of some of the things in the background.

08:35.457 --> 08:36.139
Yes.

08:36.479 --> 08:42.952
And some of my favorite, a few of my favorite ones have been ones like this that I'll do just the background of.

08:43.253 --> 08:43.513
Right.

08:44.152 --> 08:45.654
All right, let's move on.

08:45.694 --> 08:46.375
I like this one.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.116
This is Moon 707.

08:48.937 --> 09:11.543
I think the TWA version was the first 707, and this was sort of done with contrails after a famous photograph, and I don't remember who did that photograph, but of a jetliner taken as it was superimposed on a full moon.

09:11.523 --> 09:18.562
And so I tried to do the moon faithfully and the jetliner high up in the sky.

09:20.126 --> 09:20.648
Magnificent.

09:21.049 --> 09:22.292
Go a little bit more modern day.

09:22.453 --> 09:23.676
This is a space doc.

09:23.842 --> 09:31.895
Now you can see the shuttle down in the like five o'clock in that picture docked at the International Space Station.

09:32.796 --> 09:41.991
And I think that's a fairly faithful representation of the space station and all of its antennas and things there.

09:42.011 --> 09:49.663
And that's where the shuttle docks and stars in the background and you're there.

09:51.888 --> 09:53.209
Great, great detail again.

09:53.249 --> 09:55.211
Another sunset picture of F-15s.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.692
Yeah, a couple of F-15s.

09:57.093 --> 10:04.119
I had envisioned these guys over Iraq in the first Gulf War.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.564
And they are either going to or returning from a hard mission.

10:09.664 --> 10:20.074
And I'm sure they're eager to get home, but are also quite aware of what a wonderful view that must be up there.

10:20.094 --> 10:20.494
Indeed.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.341
This one is called a B-17 flak.

10:23.401 --> 10:29.570
We had a veteran on not long ago who talked about his experiences in a B-29 in Europe and avoiding the flak.

10:29.590 --> 10:31.933
And that's what this picture demonstrates right here.

10:31.953 --> 10:34.537
Yeah, this is probably not a wonderful view up there.

10:35.418 --> 10:41.166
And a lot of those guys talk about flak being so thick you can get out and walk on it.

10:41.669 --> 10:49.602
And of course, the flak are exploding shells and shrapnel and steel shreds are very efficient at tearing up planes.

10:49.682 --> 10:55.532
And so I'm sure to them, that was a terrifying thought.

10:55.552 --> 10:56.814
Indeed.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.056
Fortress squadron.

10:58.076 --> 11:04.707
Yeah, this one of my favorites, just a group of B-17s coming back from a mission.

11:04.727 --> 11:06.029
They're still in one piece.

11:07.071 --> 11:08.453
They're probably all

11:08.855 --> 11:15.061
counting their missions, aiming for that magic 25 when they'll be rotated out.

11:15.081 --> 11:21.247
But a great airplane, nice formation.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.729
Fantastic.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.910
Let's take a break.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.031
We're going to see a lot more pictures.

11:25.051 --> 11:29.295
But I know you brought a couple of your works with you.

11:29.315 --> 11:33.420
And if you could hold those up and sort of, we can see it on the camera.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.942
And you're going to talk a little bit about your technique.

11:36.142 --> 11:41.028
Yeah, this is just to show, which one?

11:41.228 --> 11:41.829
That one?

11:41.849 --> 11:42.310
Yeah, there we go.

11:42.610 --> 11:42.890
Okay.

11:43.351 --> 11:45.534
This is just to show how they print up.

11:47.016 --> 11:54.104
And a good friend of mine at Copy Corner works with me on these and I think does a remarkable job.

11:55.827 --> 11:58.049
But as I say, these are all done from scratch.

11:59.431 --> 12:02.655
Most of these I can see before I start them.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.733
I can see here.

12:04.753 --> 12:05.595
I'll hold that one up.

12:05.635 --> 12:06.999
There you go.

12:09.846 --> 12:11.491
Try to get the reflection off of it.

12:11.651 --> 12:13.115
Right, right.

12:14.138 --> 12:16.424
Some people might think you're holding it the wrong way, but you're not.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.028
That's a vertical picture.

12:18.211 --> 12:21.996
Yeah, and I wanted to give the viewer a sense of motion now.

12:22.077 --> 12:41.805
Let me point, that's the B-29, and his number two engine is feathered, and is smoking, and is on fire, and I always thought a couple of Jap Zeroes were going to come in and finish the straggler off, but three P-38s are going to prevent that from happening, and so he can land short in Iwo Jima.

12:42.325 --> 12:56.963
All of these to me have sort of a made up story, but just to give you a sense of height, motion, offset horizon, hopefully a little drama.

12:57.003 --> 12:58.585
I think this one has some drama in it.

13:00.227 --> 13:00.467
Wow.

13:02.309 --> 13:03.591
Now a photograph,

13:03.858 --> 13:07.727
A photograph like that, about how long would that take you to do?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.892
A picture, not a photograph.

13:09.912 --> 13:10.493
A picture, excuse me.

13:10.513 --> 13:11.135
Yes, I'm sorry.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.300
A work like that.

13:14.643 --> 13:17.209
Probably two weeks.

13:17.358 --> 13:18.901
10 days, two weeks, something like that.

13:19.001 --> 13:23.170
And when you get to it, you just sort of do a little bit of work on it each evening?

13:23.210 --> 13:27.298
Yes, as my wife and border collie will allow.

13:27.318 --> 13:31.867
It's nothing you can rush, obviously, because the technique on this obviously calls for a lot of patience, right?

13:31.887 --> 13:39.062
No, and not only do I back up constantly as I go along,

13:39.042 --> 13:44.890
you and the rest of the world never sees the many that did not make it.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.115
That did not make it, that were on the cutting room floor, so to speak.

13:48.235 --> 13:51.379
The great digital pixel heaven is where they are.

13:52.140 --> 13:57.648
Now what we're looking at with each one of these works, this is something that starts off in your mind.

13:57.828 --> 14:01.954
You have an idea of what you're going to do, so it's you, your mind, and a blank computer screen.

14:02.975 --> 14:08.543
Talk a little bit, obviously it would take as many shows to talk completely about the technique and what you do,

14:09.097 --> 14:28.877
how do you how do you how do you draw a star on an airplane how do you how do you create how do you create the moon and its craters how how sort of how do you do that well it's it's it's generally with a mouse and use several graphics and drawing programs but again

14:30.275 --> 14:40.658
easily as much work on the world behind the subject, water, ocean, clouds, as the subjects themselves.

14:40.678 --> 14:47.794
And again, I picture myself there and can see it before I start.

14:48.702 --> 14:49.744
Absolutely fascinating.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.085
Let's go.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.030
We've got some more photographs to look at.

14:53.070 --> 14:54.132
We've looked at 10 already.

14:54.152 --> 14:54.914
We've got a few more.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.098
This is called A. Blinken.

14:57.118 --> 15:00.264
I want to ask you where you came up with the name and talk a little bit about the work.

15:01.366 --> 15:02.088
This F.A.

15:02.108 --> 15:10.344
18 with his tail hooked down, full flaps, rich mixture in the engines is getting ready to land on the U.S.S.A.

15:10.384 --> 15:11.065
Blinken.

15:11.045 --> 15:12.129
I see, there you go.

15:12.149 --> 15:12.953
So that's where Abe Lincoln came from.

15:12.973 --> 15:14.680
That's the carrier that we see in the background.

15:14.800 --> 15:21.527
And up at the top left, the helicopter in case something goes wrong, and the various escort vessels.

15:22.165 --> 15:28.432
Now, I wanna hold that picture because I want people to look at the detail of the water.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.696
In your mind's eye, you decided what kind of chop you wanted in that water.

15:32.776 --> 15:37.441
It was a relatively mild sea for this particular picture.

15:37.461 --> 15:41.525
At least it looks like it from that altitude anyway.

15:41.545 --> 15:48.713
And I mean, each one of those bumps in the water that we take for granted is just a picture of the ocean

15:49.418 --> 15:51.723
That's your work at home.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.527
That's created.

15:53.627 --> 15:57.856
Each shadow, where it turns from dark to light.

15:57.876 --> 15:58.959
That's my ocean.

15:58.979 --> 15:59.861
That's your ocean.

16:00.262 --> 16:04.290
And the fascination that I have with that is just amazing.

16:04.330 --> 16:07.377
And the horizon out there, and you can see the little bit of the...

16:07.610 --> 16:10.313
of the horizon arc out there.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.898
And what I wanted was horizon obviously miles away.

16:14.198 --> 16:14.559
Exactly.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.262
I wanted a sun or cloud reflection.

16:17.322 --> 16:21.147
And then in the foreground, I wanted you to know that that was really deep.

16:23.170 --> 16:27.215
Got something that's not necessarily military, but I was just fascinated by this.

16:27.255 --> 16:28.657
This is Golden Gate Fog.

16:28.677 --> 16:30.259
It's a very apropos title.

16:30.526 --> 16:51.176
Well, and we had seen fog out there and just wanted one from probably an aircraft vantage point and with the fog in the valleys in the background beyond the near mountains and just wanted to try my hand at fog.

16:53.519 --> 16:54.120
Okay.

16:54.539 --> 16:55.761
Talk about this one.

16:55.781 --> 16:58.906
This is one of your at sea warrants.

16:59.206 --> 16:59.527
Yeah.

16:59.727 --> 17:09.261
And to me, this is more ominous when it's dark in the foreground, when you, the viewer, are very low in the ocean.

17:09.362 --> 17:15.010
And this is one of the Soviet Kirov class missile cruisers.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.235
And these things were designed to take out our Navy.

17:19.025 --> 17:26.503
And so this is an ominous vessel and was in the, I think was designed in the early mid 80s.

17:27.007 --> 17:31.812
But they had numerous ones of these things.

17:31.832 --> 17:39.720
But again, I wanted the angle coming at you, the viewer low, just ominous and scary.

17:39.740 --> 17:50.331
Obviously, the fact that this is supposed to happen at dusk or in the evening time or something because of the dark tones and all that, that adds to the ominous flavor of the work.

17:50.451 --> 17:51.192
Right, right.

17:52.977 --> 17:55.340
Now we're getting even more ominous.

17:55.580 --> 17:56.962
This is a Bismarck evening.

17:57.182 --> 18:06.173
And that's the Bismarck with an escorting sub, I think, U119.

18:08.015 --> 18:15.724
But I just envisioned that this was before the battle where the hood was sunk and perhaps on the way to that battle.

18:16.565 --> 18:21.010
And that's middle of the night, moonlit,

18:21.428 --> 18:26.787
a huge ship in the background and the, and the, the sub in the foreground.

18:28.233 --> 18:28.333
Yeah.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.372
This is Corsair's Low.

18:33.574 --> 18:33.674
Yeah.

18:33.694 --> 18:40.903
And these are A7 Corsairs, I think off the Ariskany, off Vietnam.

18:40.983 --> 18:45.870
Again, a similar type, ocean and moon.

18:46.350 --> 18:50.516
I just like moonlight on oceans.

18:50.536 --> 18:51.096
Right.

18:51.237 --> 18:57.865
And I just figured that these guys were either coming in or going out low to avoid radar.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.170
Right, and that depicts that so well.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.195
And the trail following the final fighter there.

19:04.575 --> 19:05.677
USS New Jersey.

19:05.717 --> 19:12.087
Yeah, this is in New Jersey, and I think this is accurately done as far as how the ship looked.

19:12.708 --> 19:15.773
And I always forget how huge those things were.

19:16.995 --> 19:25.608
But again, on a good swell in the ocean, again, a little calmer ocean with moonlight.

19:25.628 --> 19:26.029
All right.

19:26.498 --> 19:30.802
Now we're going to move a little bit more modern day, I guess you can say.

19:30.842 --> 19:32.064
This one is just called Duel.

19:32.384 --> 19:43.635
Yeah, and these are two unnamed vehicles out in the desert, obviously both well armed and very close.

19:44.096 --> 19:45.757
And this is like fast draw.

19:46.278 --> 19:48.380
They're pointing at each other.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.983
Whichever one gets his shot off first is going to live the day.

19:54.045 --> 19:54.666
Fascinating.

19:55.270 --> 19:58.624
Now this, I think, comes from Desert Storm, is that right?

19:58.664 --> 19:59.367
Is that a patriot?

19:59.568 --> 20:00.010
Yes.

20:00.050 --> 20:02.199
That's a box of patriots.

20:02.400 --> 20:02.661
Right.

20:02.681 --> 20:03.846
Yes.

20:04.619 --> 20:06.862
And we remember the Patriot missile.

20:07.563 --> 20:13.532
Black Hawk Patrol, I know this is one of your favorite ones along with the next one that we'll see is the A-10 patrol.

20:13.592 --> 20:15.155
Talk about this one.

20:15.195 --> 20:16.617
Talk about detail in the background.

20:16.797 --> 20:27.032
Yeah, a couple of Black Hawks, maybe over Afghanistan, just bad, rugged territory, no place that you'd wanna go down.

20:27.012 --> 20:34.779
So a dangerous, ominous background with fairly detailed Blackhawks.

20:34.819 --> 20:39.013
Again, rotor motion was technically difficult for me.

20:41.862 --> 20:42.703
Ah, yes.

20:42.723 --> 20:48.911
Here's an A-10 Warthog, the tank buster with the Gatling gun in the front.

20:49.372 --> 20:50.213
Right.

20:50.574 --> 21:07.296
And I pictured this over mountainous areas in Afghanistan looking for bad guy vehicles, bad guy tanks, anything on the ground that those guys need to be aware of.

21:08.272 --> 21:11.157
Again, the star of that one was obviously the airplane.

21:11.177 --> 21:14.223
That was the central focus, but the work was really in the background.

21:14.604 --> 21:15.145
It was.

21:15.165 --> 21:18.291
I mean, that's where the sweat and the tears come from.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.233
And the tears.

21:19.293 --> 21:19.954
A lot of tears.

21:20.695 --> 21:27.248
A lot of your work has to do with military, military air, military sea, and all that.

21:27.308 --> 21:28.390
Not all of it, but...

21:28.370 --> 21:35.538
Talk about your own passion for the military and for honoring the veterans here like we do on this show.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.883
Where did your interest in military art come about?

21:39.903 --> 21:51.036
Well, my father and brother were military and my brother had been career in the Air Force.

21:51.168 --> 22:05.566
And many of these things I've printed and given away to veterans or especially pilots who flew these things and who could tell me more about what I was looking at than what I had just drawn.

22:06.327 --> 22:11.033
And so when one of those guys, and they're dying off rapidly,

22:11.013 --> 22:18.745
You know, when one of them or their family walks out of the office having received one of these things, it makes it all worth it.

22:19.366 --> 22:23.532
But I've always, you know, as a kid, I always wanted to draw planes and never could.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.214
Right, right.

22:25.235 --> 22:29.481
I want to make sure because we're going to see some more pictures, but I don't want to run out of time before.

22:30.042 --> 22:34.168
Can you tell people the website that they can go to to see...

22:34.148 --> 22:35.790
Really everything that you have.

22:36.471 --> 22:36.571
Yeah.

22:36.591 --> 22:37.712
In fact, no, I can't.

22:37.732 --> 22:38.072
You can't.

22:38.132 --> 22:38.413
Okay.

22:38.913 --> 22:40.255
I know a way to find it, though.

22:40.315 --> 22:48.784
It's this long, but if they will Google the three A's, Alexander Aviation Art, it'll come up.

22:49.065 --> 22:50.446
I Googled just Philip Alexander.

22:50.546 --> 22:51.247
That's what I did.

22:51.267 --> 22:53.009
And about the third one down, and there you were.

22:53.109 --> 22:53.449
Oh, really?

22:53.490 --> 22:54.431
It was just that easy.

22:55.171 --> 22:56.713
So get it through Google, folks.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.516
That's how you run your life, right?

22:59.536 --> 23:00.097
Through Google.

23:00.157 --> 23:01.118
That's how you can do it.

23:01.098 --> 23:03.463
or just Alexander Aviation Art.

23:03.604 --> 23:04.025
There it is.

23:04.085 --> 23:06.370
And you can see all the photographs.

23:06.410 --> 23:15.150
And I know that those of you who are watching in high definition this show, you're really getting a great, great idea, taste of this.

23:15.631 --> 23:19.039
But seeing this art in person, it's...

23:19.019 --> 23:20.400
It's unlike anything else.

23:20.701 --> 23:22.342
It really, really is.

23:22.482 --> 23:26.786
And I also want to mention that Dr. Alexander is a supporter of KAMU TV.

23:26.826 --> 23:36.255
I know that each year I have the honor of working on the KAMU auction, which raises money for KAMU, and he always donates a print or two for us to auction off.

23:36.275 --> 23:40.779
So lucky supporters of KAMU have these in their home, and we appreciate that.

23:40.999 --> 23:44.982
We've got a few more pictures to look at, so let's go ahead and take a look at those.

23:45.163 --> 23:47.064
And this one is our number 21.

23:47.204 --> 23:49.026
This is called Tank Attack.

23:49.006 --> 23:51.989
Yeah, and I pictured this in World War II.

23:52.069 --> 24:05.100
Those are an older type tank, probably North Africa, desert campaign, churning up the dust, just ready for the action.

24:06.462 --> 24:07.262
Indeed.

24:07.443 --> 24:19.013
And again, like some of the ships, I put the viewer very low just to be a little more dangerous and ominous and eye-catching.

24:19.955 --> 24:20.996
Okay, let's move on.

24:21.076 --> 24:21.837
Snowy Ambush.

24:22.097 --> 24:22.638
I love this one.

24:23.579 --> 24:25.441
I'd forgotten this one until you pulled it up.

24:26.522 --> 24:30.326
This guy's waiting for somebody to come over the pass.

24:30.346 --> 24:40.296
He's well camouflaged, probably been there a day, and he's got some of these buddies equally well hidden, but he's waiting for it.

24:41.618 --> 24:42.338
I love the snow.

24:43.359 --> 24:45.962
Now this one is one that you

24:46.246 --> 24:53.815
You suggested it to me and I'm so glad you did because this is a depiction of the survivors of the USS Indianapolis.

24:53.835 --> 25:02.204
We've had the honor of having on this show Glenn Morgan who was one of the survivors of the USS Indianapolis and sort of talk about what this is.

25:02.505 --> 25:14.278
Well somebody wanted me to do one that was about the sinking of the Indianapolis and I thought to me one of the best ways to do that was not to show the ship because ships

25:14.579 --> 25:17.863
Ship's gone and they didn't know about it for, what, four days or something.

25:17.883 --> 25:18.003
Right.

25:18.023 --> 25:23.029
And so here are the survivors, the lucky ones that had lifeboats.

25:23.610 --> 25:27.915
And obviously in the foreground, you see the sharks.

25:28.396 --> 25:35.484
And again, that must have been just a terrifying experience and, of course, lost many.

25:35.504 --> 25:35.745
Right.

25:35.765 --> 25:37.667
Many of those who died were from a shark attack.

25:37.647 --> 25:46.521
But if I were to do a portrait of the Indianapolis, to me, this is what a portrait of that ship looks like because of the story.

25:46.762 --> 25:50.868
The desolate Pacific Ocean, the men in the rafts.

25:50.908 --> 25:56.577
And that depicts it very well, according to Glenn Morgan, because there were groups of rafts like that.

25:56.637 --> 26:00.483
There were also groups miles away where there might have been only one raft.

26:00.503 --> 26:03.368
They were scattered out throughout the ocean as they were wading

26:03.348 --> 26:12.878
of four days and five nights to be rescued, and one of their enemies were the sharks, and many were lost to shark attack.

26:12.898 --> 26:14.419
That's a great depiction.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.982
This one is called Tank Burning.

26:17.002 --> 26:32.978
Well, and obviously the victor is the guy over at the left, and with the exploded and now burning tank with the turret falling off the front, that just depicts some of the hell of the war.

26:32.998 --> 26:33.338
Indeed.

26:34.077 --> 26:37.581
A group of your pictures is called Fantasy, and we've got some from that.

26:37.641 --> 26:39.563
And this is one, and this is one of my favorites.

26:39.583 --> 26:40.905
This one's hanging in your office.

26:41.465 --> 26:46.251
It's called Skylight is the short title, or just a stoplight in the sky.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.272
And you can see what this is.

26:47.312 --> 26:52.418
This is a stoplight stopping the bombers and the fighters so that the single wing can come on through.

26:52.678 --> 26:56.743
And I can just imagine the B-52s and F-15s waiting in line

26:57.196 --> 26:59.920
revving their engines while the Piper Cub goes through.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.522
He's got the green light.

27:01.542 --> 27:04.266
He's got the green light that's being held by the hot air balloon.

27:04.986 --> 27:07.971
That is Dr. Alexander's imagination, as is this.

27:07.991 --> 27:11.355
And I like the title of this as much as I like the picture.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.037
I'm going to go ahead and let you tell them the title.

27:13.057 --> 27:14.680
Well, the title is MIG Hinge.

27:15.561 --> 27:18.625
These are, I think those are MIG-25s.

27:20.067 --> 27:26.916
And they found some of those things that were buried during the current Iraq war.

27:27.638 --> 27:30.770
And I thought, just make a little fantasy out of it.

27:30.870 --> 27:34.223
And some were buried and some were disguised as Migham.

27:35.502 --> 27:36.644
Off of Stonehenge.

27:36.664 --> 27:45.339
Okay, you asked me to include these next two works in here, and this is out of your fantasy group, and it's called The Discovery.

27:45.359 --> 27:49.826
So I want to talk about this and the genesis of how all this came about.

27:49.846 --> 27:58.000
Oh, I made up a short story about a tunnel that was found near Uray, Colorado.

27:58.300 --> 28:05.050
And there had been an old atomic nuclear weapons storage facility there.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.273
This is all made up, not a word of truth to it.

28:08.234 --> 28:14.263
And that a friend of mine and I found this and we only had one flashlight and one camera.

28:14.323 --> 28:20.793
And so I did some of the walls and the corridors in this old abandoned facility.

28:21.974 --> 28:23.076
And we've got a...

28:23.275 --> 28:30.314
I think there's 12 works in all from this discovery thing, and we've picked a couple of them there.

28:30.334 --> 28:35.006
Oh, I'm the only one who can take you on a complete tour of a facility that does not exist.

28:35.026 --> 28:37.673
Well, find the website and you can find them all.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.622
And that's just amazing.

28:39.662 --> 28:45.014
I wish we had time to see even more, but we've got just a little bit of a sampling.

28:45.034 --> 28:50.966
And I think you said you don't know exactly how many you've done, but the website itself probably has 700 or more.

28:51.186 --> 28:51.828
Seven or 800.

28:52.309 --> 28:53.752
Seven or 800 of those.

28:54.393 --> 28:55.676
Just a few minutes we have left.

28:55.716 --> 28:57.720
I know that you're not just...

28:58.443 --> 29:02.549
What you do is obviously a physician for some 35 years here in the Brazos Valley.

29:02.869 --> 29:05.253
You're into coin collecting, you're into astronomy.

29:05.273 --> 29:11.121
I know that through your recommendation, you got me into super slow weight training.

29:11.201 --> 29:15.027
So I've been doing it for three years.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.108
Do we take our shirts off?

29:16.910 --> 29:18.111
No, I don't think so.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.253
That's why we're still training.

29:19.233 --> 29:21.515
But you're into a lot of that too.

29:21.535 --> 29:24.618
So you just, you don't ever rest, I guess, do you?

29:24.638 --> 29:25.979
It keeps me off the streets.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.200
It does keep you off the streets.

29:27.481 --> 29:27.941
It really does.

29:28.241 --> 29:36.008
And again, if you want to see Dr. Alexander's work, you can do it right now just through your computer by, like I said, the website is real long.

29:36.409 --> 29:43.996
So just go to Google and you can type Philip Alexander and it'll be right there, Alexander Aviation Art, and it'll be right there.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.058
And can I say one thing about the website?

29:46.858 --> 29:48.700
It's managed by a friend of mine

29:48.680 --> 30:04.635
who is a former B-29 pilot, former B-47 pilot in Minnesota and is probably 84 years old, but he manages this and it was through his efforts that he put all these on there.

30:04.655 --> 30:05.777
He's done a great job.

30:05.757 --> 30:07.500
Dr. Alexander, thank you, but we're out of time.

30:07.620 --> 30:08.201
Hey, glad to be here.

30:08.221 --> 30:08.581
I appreciate it.

30:08.862 --> 30:12.387
You've seen just a portion of Dr. Alexander's amazing computer artwork.

30:12.407 --> 30:18.195
His work is not just limited to military themes, and his hobbies are not just limited to artwork.

30:18.215 --> 30:23.964
Like we said, he's into coin collecting, astronomy, weight training, music composition, and an amateur radio operator.

30:24.024 --> 30:28.310
We thank Dr. Philip Alexander for letting us share his magnificent work.

30:28.330 --> 30:29.232
I'm Tom Turbeville.

30:29.252 --> 30:31.495
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

30:37.178 --> 30:41.086
.

30:41.106 --> 30:55.474
.

31:13.915 --> 31:21.592
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

31:21.612 --> 31:30.272
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

31:30.653 --> 31:31.715
First National Bank.
