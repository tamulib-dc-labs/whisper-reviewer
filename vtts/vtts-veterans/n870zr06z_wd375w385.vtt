00:03.406 --> 00:27.067
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:27.468 --> 00:28.890
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:29.579 --> 00:33.549
Frank Dickey refuses to call himself a hero, but most might disagree.

00:33.869 --> 00:44.736
He says that in Vietnam, he fought alongside heroes, but he, like many who went, who fought, who came home, he prefers to reserve that label for heroes who did not come home.

00:45.678 --> 00:48.884
He was not an officer, nor a company commander, nor a phantom pilot.

00:48.944 --> 00:53.593
Frank Dickey's role in Vietnam was as the guy who laid his life on the line every patrol.

00:53.994 --> 00:59.243
Just infantry, army, search and destroy, chopping away at the jungle in search of the enemy.

00:59.263 --> 01:01.007
Yes, by many standards, a hero.

01:01.027 --> 01:04.834
And it is our honor to have him as our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.854 --> 01:06.477
Frank Dickey, it is an honor to have you.

01:06.497 --> 01:07.078
Let's talk.

01:07.058 --> 01:10.203
about going to Vietnam, but let's start before that.

01:10.223 --> 01:14.749
You were raised in Palestine, Texas, came to Texas A&M on a basketball scholarship.

01:14.769 --> 01:19.797
That didn't work out, and you, like so many people at that time, the 60s, you were drafted.

01:20.218 --> 01:23.903
Sort of take it from there and how you got into country at Vietnam.

01:24.305 --> 01:27.491
Well, I received a draft notice.

01:27.711 --> 01:31.698
There's a lot of people during that era, young men of my age.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.603
It actually does say greetings.

01:36.066 --> 01:41.335
And it was signed by Lyndon Baines Johnson and it asked me to

01:41.315 --> 01:42.717
to serve my country.

01:42.737 --> 01:55.197
So I went and had my physical and it was about two and a half months and I was inducted and sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, where I had my training.

01:55.217 --> 02:00.405
And about four months after that, I was in Vietnam.

02:00.425 --> 02:02.308
Well, let's sort of give people a timeline here.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.591
December of 66, that's when you took your physical.

02:04.712 --> 02:08.858
You were inducted around February and by April you were in country.

02:09.091 --> 02:09.472
Yes, sir.

02:10.073 --> 02:28.669
I think, actually, I left in April, but we went by ship when we went, and I got there in July, so we had some stops, and I really didn't understand all that, and I was scared to death anyway, so.

02:29.577 --> 02:30.518
What were your thoughts back then?

02:30.538 --> 02:38.008
I mean, at that point, because just a few months earlier, I mean, you were just a country guy from Palestine, Texas, and now you were off to war.

02:38.088 --> 02:40.551
What are the personal thoughts of a young man at that time?

02:41.833 --> 02:47.160
Obviously, the war was starting to become controversial.

02:47.280 --> 02:56.371
It had gotten, I think, by 66 or 67 to start to be an issue discussed, especially in college campuses and around.

02:57.172 --> 02:57.593
Right.

02:57.758 --> 03:01.788
I did not disagree with war.

03:03.051 --> 03:11.211
I thought I understood the concept of the domino theory and the fact that we were trying to contain communism

03:11.782 --> 03:16.606
I wanted people anywhere in the world that wanted to be free to be free.

03:17.267 --> 03:23.292
And you can't just be for freedom part of the time or half of the time.

03:24.013 --> 03:25.594
You're either for freedom or you're not.

03:26.135 --> 03:27.536
And that's the way I looked at it.

03:27.656 --> 03:28.957
And so it didn't bother me much.

03:29.478 --> 03:32.620
I knew there were people who disagreed, but that's why we were fighting.

03:32.961 --> 03:34.562
Indeed, indeed.

03:35.143 --> 03:41.248
You said, and like we said on the outset, basically you were infantry, 11th Bravo, 4th Infantry.

03:41.380 --> 03:45.007
You were on the ground with a rifle, with a piece.

03:45.588 --> 03:48.975
Talk about sort of what your job was when you got there.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.923
Well, what we did was search and destroy missions.

03:53.364 --> 03:57.111
Our basic philosophy was that we were going to

03:57.597 --> 03:59.540
try to weed out the Viet Cong.

03:59.560 --> 04:10.378
They were hiding in the jungles and on the outskirts of villages, and we would use intelligence gathered by whatever methods, and we would go and search.

04:10.679 --> 04:11.881
And it wasn't just blind.

04:12.722 --> 04:21.236
We had a plan, and we knew that they were supposed to be there, but they were wily little devils.

04:21.337 --> 04:22.238
They moved.

04:22.589 --> 04:25.597
You know, we would get to one place and they had already moved.

04:25.677 --> 04:32.614
We could tell that they'd been there and we used that intelligence to move on and try to find them.

04:32.674 --> 04:38.309
So basically, we just hunted around Vietnam for the bad guys.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.231
Yeah, I think you told me that

04:39.447 --> 04:44.153
In reality, about 80% of your time was spent searching, 20% time actually in contact with the enemy.

04:44.533 --> 04:45.074
Absolutely.

04:45.274 --> 04:49.960
And I think you will find most people in combat would say that that was about right.

04:50.781 --> 04:56.108
Obviously, you remember that 20% because when you're shot at, it's a lot different.

04:56.208 --> 05:02.957
But as also that I mentioned, the elements were horrible.

05:03.359 --> 05:14.831
And those were day-to-day, and not being able to brush your teeth as many times as you would like, you know, take a bath, you know, get clean, wash your hair.

05:15.632 --> 05:21.438
Those were wait until you went back to base camp and, you know, had a few days to stay back there.

05:21.839 --> 05:21.959
Right.

05:21.979 --> 05:24.461
You were stationed at Pleiku, I believe?

05:24.481 --> 05:29.907
Pleiku, Vietnam was the 4th Infantry Division base, and that's where we worked out of.

05:30.376 --> 05:35.103
Mortar, machine gun, just a lot of heavy weapons in that infantry division.

05:35.824 --> 05:42.635
We had a unit, I believe it was Delta Company, that they loaned us mortar people.

05:43.917 --> 05:47.582
We were in the same battalion, but just different companies.

05:48.123 --> 05:57.177
We had two M60 machine guns, and I think we had an 80-millimeter mortar and a 40-millimeter mortar.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.280
Now, you told me that your unit was somewhat unique.

05:59.340 --> 06:01.162
It was OpCon, operational control.

06:01.222 --> 06:02.303
Explain what that means.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.727
You were loaned out a lot, right?

06:04.747 --> 06:12.857
For some reason, and it was probably because in 2 Corps, there wasn't much activity.

06:12.877 --> 06:17.022
Why, I don't know.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.687
actually put busy work a lot of times.

06:21.207 --> 06:26.294
I got the impression that sometimes we were searching, we weren't really looking very hard.

06:26.314 --> 06:36.968
And other units who were having contact and losing people, and as I mentioned yesterday, I think at that point in time that the supply

06:37.555 --> 06:43.061
chain that was getting replacements into Vietnam was backed up.

06:43.882 --> 06:44.924
Right.

06:44.944 --> 06:46.025
We had plenty of soldiers.

06:46.125 --> 06:50.050
We just had a hard time getting them where they needed to be.

06:50.070 --> 06:55.736
And so we were asked to be under operational control.

06:55.796 --> 06:59.461
They loaned us to other units, the 101st Airborne.

07:00.322 --> 07:07.410
And even in one stint, the Marines, the 3rd Marine Division, which was in I Corps up by Danae,

07:07.762 --> 07:11.663
I didn't like that area very much.

07:12.588 --> 07:15.813
a lot hotter than where we were used to being.

07:16.073 --> 07:18.456
You're talking about sort of the backlog of it.

07:19.177 --> 07:26.848
You mentioned that that was the time that the lottery, the first lottery was going on and there was a lot of people coming in and getting them in country and getting them at the right spot.

07:26.928 --> 07:27.729
There were bottlenecks.

07:28.550 --> 07:31.695
Obviously, this was the rumor coming down.

07:32.676 --> 07:35.540
We were promised and they said they had the people.

07:35.560 --> 07:41.228
It was just getting them in country and getting them processed and, you know, getting them there.

07:41.478 --> 07:43.160
Evidently, there was a bottleneck.

07:43.180 --> 07:43.720
Right.

07:43.740 --> 07:44.501
You went on a leave.

07:44.962 --> 07:45.763
I want you to explain this.

07:45.783 --> 07:52.350
You went on a leave, you came back home, but then you came back to Vietnam in a completely different role as a mail clerk, but then that changed.

07:52.370 --> 08:02.001
I want you to tell the story about the cook that they were going to send and how Sergeant Dickey sort of volunteered to replace that cook.

08:03.222 --> 08:08.768
Well, there are two factors in here, and one that I may not have shared exactly

08:09.608 --> 08:19.278
I had a certain amount of time left in the Army, and I did not see myself as a garrison soldier.

08:19.478 --> 08:25.365
I had been in combat for 11 months carrying a weapon.

08:25.725 --> 08:32.472
My attitude might not have been the best as far as military discipline and that kind of thing.

08:32.492 --> 08:38.839
I did not want to go back and polish shoes and paint rocks, and I know it's terrible,

08:39.865 --> 08:42.869
But I felt more comfortable being in Vietnam.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.753
Now, I know that sounds weird, and I didn't think about my family.

08:45.833 --> 08:52.061
My mother was terribly upset, as she should have been, for me volunteering to go back over.

08:54.144 --> 08:55.265
But that's what I did.

08:55.706 --> 09:00.192
And I came home on leave for 30 days and then returned.

09:00.212 --> 09:03.776
And as they promised, a lot of people say the Army doesn't do it.

09:03.796 --> 09:04.237
They did.

09:04.898 --> 09:06.700
They gave me a job as a mail clerk.

09:07.372 --> 09:13.855
And while I was there, there came a requisition to our unit, to the MP unit,

09:14.611 --> 09:17.895
that they needed more infantry.

09:17.915 --> 09:25.384
And of course, a lot of people have 11 Bravo and then they have a secondary military occupational.

09:26.385 --> 09:33.914
We had a cook that was, well, he wasn't the bravest guy I've ever known.

09:34.135 --> 09:34.896
He was a good cook.

09:34.956 --> 09:37.299
He was a great cook and he was a good guy.

09:38.340 --> 09:43.386
And they were going to send him to an infantry unit and I did not feel

09:44.075 --> 09:49.262
that he was properly trained, nor would he have been very, very good at it.

09:50.144 --> 10:00.318
I was afraid that because of his fear, that not only would he be in danger to himself, but also to other people in his unit.

10:01.079 --> 10:07.207
I went to the first sergeant and volunteered to say, hey, don't send this guy.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.512
I don't think he's capable of doing it.

10:10.812 --> 10:12.114
At least I can stay alive.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.356
I know I've been there.

10:13.555 --> 10:14.917
Fin May, and he did.

10:15.357 --> 10:16.519
Indeed.

10:17.199 --> 10:26.871
In history books, when people talk about the Vietnam War, and you are a former history teacher, and when they taught the Vietnam War, probably if there was a turning point of the Vietnam War, it would be called the Tet Offensive.

10:27.071 --> 10:28.413
You were there during the Tet Offensive.

10:29.114 --> 10:35.241
Describe, if you will, what the Tet Offensive was like for the people who don't know what it was and what it was like for a U.S.

10:35.281 --> 10:36.002
soldier on the ground.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.817
Well, let me start generally.

10:40.178 --> 10:45.707
As we found out later, it was a uniquely coordinated offensive.

10:47.691 --> 10:55.965
The North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong, who were the volunteer arm of the Communist forces,

10:55.945 --> 11:03.714
coordinated attacks in, as I remember, 60 different cities at the same time.

11:04.434 --> 11:10.061
It was during the Tet, which was between our Christmas and our New Year's.

11:11.222 --> 11:23.315
We had just signed a ceasefire agreement with Hanoi that there wouldn't be any fighting during this period of time, and we were kind of in a stand down.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.918
Now, you know, shame on us for that.

11:26.776 --> 11:28.879
But we were kicked pretty hard.

11:30.161 --> 11:36.931
I know that in our unit, at that particular time, we were near Da Nang.

11:36.951 --> 11:49.490
And boy, that was, I can literally say that that was the most fighting, most intense combat that I experienced over there.

11:49.650 --> 11:54.117
And they were cranked up and fired up.

11:54.653 --> 11:59.544
They were trying to take the city of Da Nang and all of our bases there and everything.

11:59.564 --> 12:04.615
And it was, you know, we fought very, very hard.

12:06.399 --> 12:07.802
We pushed them back.

12:07.842 --> 12:10.448
And this is when I told you when we got separated.

12:10.568 --> 12:14.417
We were really cut off.

12:14.785 --> 12:16.710
for about three or four days.

12:17.030 --> 12:20.419
And it was not a pretty thing.

12:20.479 --> 12:24.188
We lost, I think, about 50% of our company during that period.

12:24.208 --> 12:30.583
And there was a point there that you, because of the communication problem, that you really had to take over the company.

12:30.563 --> 12:57.280
I don't think the Army probably wants to publicize that, but yes, for a few hours I did have to make logistical decisions about water and food, trying to get our people safe, you know, some kind of a perimeter, you know, where we can defend ourselves until which time, you know, communication was restored and

12:57.800 --> 12:59.663
and then we could get some help.

12:59.683 --> 13:10.257
The first platoon Lieutenant, Lieutenant Powers, I believe his name was, was even estranged from us.

13:11.579 --> 13:12.601
He helped a lot.

13:12.721 --> 13:17.007
I asked his advice and he said, hey, you're going to have to run things.

13:17.067 --> 13:20.272
I'm not there, I can't see, but I will help you.

13:20.472 --> 13:24.477
And a great officer, those kinds of people.

13:25.299 --> 13:27.722
He did not presume to be

13:28.192 --> 13:31.277
And brighter than I, he just wanted to give me help.

13:31.297 --> 13:34.583
And as a unit, we, you know, we survived.

13:34.603 --> 13:36.667
So it was a good thing.

13:36.687 --> 13:49.930
Frank, I guess when any young man goes to war, whether it was World War I, World War II, Vietnam, Korea, even today, what runs through their mind is how am I going to feel the first time that I'm put in a position to where I have to shoot in another human being?

13:50.483 --> 13:51.444
That happened to you.

13:52.225 --> 13:53.327
I want you to talk about that.

13:53.827 --> 14:07.464
Actually, there's sort of almost a humorous angle to that that you told me about, but tell that story first and then you told me yesterday about how a person just has to change their personality in a situation like that.

14:08.025 --> 14:13.392
Talk about the event first and then talk about your thoughts about how a person has to change to fulfill that role.

14:13.412 --> 14:13.712
Okay.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.358
We were on a search and destroy mission.

14:18.418 --> 14:19.900
We were in the mountains.

14:20.825 --> 14:28.251
If I remember correctly, we were probably three or four cliques from the Cambodia border, the Mekong River.

14:29.252 --> 14:40.282
And we were trying to keep the VC from slipping through us and getting into the interior.

14:40.822 --> 14:50.190
And as we were going through the mountains, of course, you have a machete in one hand, you have your weapon strap, and you're chopping at the

14:50.693 --> 14:53.179
because you can't get through.

14:53.219 --> 14:53.980
It's too thick.

14:54.942 --> 15:00.615
And I happened to notice that three of the enemy just barely got a glimpse of them.

15:01.196 --> 15:05.125
And the trail that we were on curved around and came straight at me.

15:05.797 --> 15:09.581
Well, I anticipated that they were walking down the trail.

15:11.703 --> 15:21.434
Some of the signals we used in the infantry to everybody get quiet, and then of course we tried to get our people to spread out.

15:22.815 --> 15:24.237
We didn't have that much time.

15:24.297 --> 15:26.860
The warning was not that quick.

15:26.960 --> 15:35.449
So when he came around the curve, I was very nervous about my ability to shoot the enemy.

15:36.188 --> 15:41.775
I had good training, but you get nervous about it.

15:42.956 --> 15:49.544
So I also had an over and under, which had a 40 millimeter grenade launcher under the weapon.

15:50.325 --> 16:01.859
And I thought, you know, I can hit something a lot easier with this grenade than I can with a 7.62 millimeter deal.

16:01.879 --> 16:05.503
So I decided to shoot him with my grenade launcher.

16:05.872 --> 16:12.825
And during this tense moment, I had forgotten that I had a flare round in there instead of a heat round.

16:12.845 --> 16:14.688
A heat round is the actual grenade.

16:15.410 --> 16:18.535
A flare round is a phosphorus piece.

16:18.696 --> 16:24.927
You shoot it up, it's got a little parachute with it, and you shoot it up to illuminate at night where you can see.

16:25.885 --> 16:29.629
Well, I shot this guy with a flare around him.

16:29.649 --> 16:31.431
It hit him in his chest and knocked him down.

16:31.931 --> 16:37.057
And then we captured the other two.

16:37.077 --> 16:42.142
As I understand, unfortunately, this guy died later on because of the phosphorus burns on his chest and everything.

16:42.162 --> 16:52.253
But, you know, I was very upset at having taken a life of another human being.

16:52.713 --> 16:54.255
It's the way we were raised.

16:54.725 --> 16:56.448
even though we're trained.

16:56.889 --> 17:07.068
It is something that in a normal societal situation such as over here, you're taught not to do that.

17:08.551 --> 17:15.163
But dealing with it and grieving and dealing with it, you don't have time for that.

17:15.447 --> 17:22.118
You're in a combat situation, so you don't have time to deal with your defense mechanisms.

17:22.218 --> 17:25.344
You don't have to deal with how you've been taught.

17:25.644 --> 17:26.425
You've got to fight.

17:26.525 --> 17:34.899
You've got to continue to function because your soldier mates need you to do that.

17:34.919 --> 17:38.165
And so it's waited until later to deal with.

17:38.185 --> 17:39.447
And a lot of times...

17:40.692 --> 17:47.865
You have to build up defenses because it'll drive you crazy psychologically.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.472
You have to be cold and hard.

17:51.572 --> 17:55.219
You have to use some other method to deal with this.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.709
Mine had to be humor, very bad humor I might add.

18:01.077 --> 18:05.027
at least you would kind of laugh and say, well, you know, that ruined his whole morning.

18:05.228 --> 18:08.075
Well, obviously it ruined more than his morning.

18:08.095 --> 18:12.988
But, you know, you use those to try to ease the pain.

18:13.910 --> 18:16.116
And it worked.

18:16.417 --> 18:25.693
But again, as we discussed yesterday, they have a name for it now, and I think it's post-traumatic combat syndrome.

18:27.456 --> 18:40.618
My son is over in Iraq now and will soon return, and he will go through a process, he informs me, of about 60 days, where he will talk to psychiatrists and psychologists and

18:40.598 --> 18:44.270
Gosh, I wish they might have had something like that when we returned.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.263
Unfortunately, they didn't, and a lot of our guys and gals

18:48.665 --> 19:01.267
did not fare well when they came back to real society because it was hard to change back to the rules of this society and dealing with it.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.591
And it was something they needed help.

19:03.611 --> 19:04.452
Some of them got help.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.656
Some of them didn't, unfortunately.

19:06.676 --> 19:11.685
I asked you if you were wounded in Vietnam, and you said yes, but it was almost an afterthought for you.

19:11.705 --> 19:13.468
But you were wounded in Vietnam.

19:13.488 --> 19:14.149
Talk about...

19:14.129 --> 19:16.833
that incident, what happened, and what your wounds were?

19:17.354 --> 19:20.058
Well, there were two instances.

19:20.760 --> 19:25.968
One was shrapnel, which really wasn't much of anything.

19:26.549 --> 19:35.924
I got one in the corner of the mouth, a little dill here, and most of the rest of it was in my posterior.

19:36.805 --> 19:41.773
Because when the first explosion went, we turned and tried to get away.

19:42.125 --> 19:46.112
And, you know, I didn't even, you know, the medic took care of it.

19:46.172 --> 19:48.215
It was no, you know, situation.

19:48.275 --> 19:53.965
It was no more than scratching my head as I did the other day working in the yard.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.433
But the second time was a bullet wound.

19:58.653 --> 20:03.702
It went through another person.

20:03.722 --> 20:08.149
Bless his heart, but I'm certainly glad he was there for me.

20:08.669 --> 20:11.475
And it didn't go in very far.

20:11.535 --> 20:13.559
It wasn't a very hard wound.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.363
There was a lot of bleeding.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.470
And of course, I thought I was dying.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.655
You know, that's just the way it is.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.180
I had a long talk with the Lord.

20:23.421 --> 20:29.293
You know, I probably needed to have that talk long before, but at least we had it.

20:29.273 --> 20:31.378
And so I was okay.

20:31.458 --> 20:38.735
It was, you know, I wasn't out of commission, but about two or three weeks and then back, so.

20:38.755 --> 20:42.945
I asked Sergeant Dickey if you want a Purple Heart, and again, as an afterthought, you said, yeah, you think

20:43.246 --> 20:45.869
There's one there somewhere, right?

20:45.889 --> 20:51.697
My mother's home burned in, I think, 2000.

20:51.897 --> 21:04.152
And all of those keepsakes and, unfortunately, some photographs that you mentioned that you might want were all destroyed, unfortunately, in that fire.

21:04.373 --> 21:07.456
So, you know, I don't have them to show you.

21:08.357 --> 21:10.300
I'm sure you can contact the Army.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.763
They'll have some kind of record that...

21:13.283 --> 21:15.245
A blip on the screen anyway.

21:15.265 --> 21:18.349
Wish you could contact the Army and you could get those awards back.

21:19.330 --> 21:20.312
Maybe that could be done.

21:22.594 --> 21:36.531
Ever the reluctant hero, you also sort of an afterthought told me when we were talking before about a situation where your captain was down and loaded him on your shoulder because you were the biggest guy and you took him pretty much out of harm's way.

21:37.372 --> 21:39.595
Reluctant as you are to talk about it, I wish you would.

21:40.722 --> 21:47.796
Well, it was during this situation we mentioned earlier where we got scattered.

21:48.016 --> 21:52.064
And still, as I mentioned to you, I'm not really sure how that happened.

21:52.926 --> 21:59.018
But somehow, some of the enemy got behind our lines somehow.

21:58.998 --> 22:05.807
as we were sweeping, and we got in a situation where it was just the command post.

22:05.827 --> 22:11.275
Now that's the forward observer, who is our artillery component.

22:12.537 --> 22:16.823
I was the RTO, the radio telephone operator for the captain.

22:17.904 --> 22:23.672
The executive officer, he was a first lieutenant.

22:23.804 --> 22:31.613
and a couple other members of the command post who, you know, take care of command things.

22:32.094 --> 22:34.817
And there weren't but about five or six of us there.

22:35.638 --> 22:40.644
And the captain got wounded.

22:40.664 --> 22:41.846
He got shot in the leg.

22:42.346 --> 22:44.048
It wasn't really serious.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.953
Well, what wound is not serious.

22:48.494 --> 22:51.297
I'm sure it was very serious to him.

22:52.002 --> 23:01.592
At that particular time, I made the decision that we needed to try to get back to our lines somehow.

23:01.612 --> 23:06.057
And so I made the decision that we would advance to the rear.

23:06.758 --> 23:10.041
To me, we were running away from the enemy.

23:11.103 --> 23:15.187
Since I was the biggest guy, I carried the captain.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.149
I threw him over my shoulder.

23:17.635 --> 23:22.467
very upset about the antenna of my radio hitting him in the face and stuff.

23:22.888 --> 23:29.485
I mentioned to him that I'd be happy to just put him down and go on without him.

23:29.836 --> 23:34.186
kind of humorous during that time, but we got him back and everything was fine.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.549
Probably pleased the way it worked out.

23:35.569 --> 23:38.837
There's so much more to tell your story of Vietnam, but in a few minutes we have left.

23:38.857 --> 23:41.343
I want to get to other things after Vietnam.

23:41.363 --> 23:42.365
You went to Stephen F. Austin.

23:42.385 --> 23:44.109
You graduated from Stephen F. Austin.

23:44.630 --> 23:47.878
You met your future wife there, who we're going to talk about in a moment, but then

23:48.128 --> 23:54.519
You went on into teaching in public schools, both teaching and coaching basketball and football.

23:55.300 --> 24:03.595
New Caney, Galena Park, Sugar Land, Dulles, Rosenberg, Terry, and came here and was head basketball coach at Allen Academy and also taught.

24:03.635 --> 24:08.483
So a career after Vietnam, a service in public teaching.

24:08.463 --> 24:09.284
Yes, sir.

24:09.724 --> 24:14.590
It was something that I was very passionate about.

24:14.831 --> 24:16.212
Right.

24:16.452 --> 24:25.944
As advice to any young person looking to have a career, I think passion is the most important element.

24:26.865 --> 24:26.985
Right.

24:27.005 --> 24:33.913
If you're going to do, and I told my son, I recently retired, and I told him years ago that the day

24:34.805 --> 24:38.569
that my job got to be work was the day that I was going to quit.

24:39.837 --> 24:40.562
And, uh,

24:40.711 --> 24:43.694
And when that happened, I did.

24:44.194 --> 24:45.816
It was never work to me.

24:45.836 --> 24:46.756
It was always a joy.

24:47.897 --> 24:51.261
Working with young people, they keep you young, they're different every day.

24:51.881 --> 24:52.462
It was wonderful.

24:52.802 --> 24:53.983
Just got a couple of minutes left.

24:55.044 --> 25:00.309
Your wife is Dr. Nancy Dickey, for people who don't know who she is, and I don't know who that could possibly be.

25:01.189 --> 25:09.537
Dr. Dickey is the president of the A&M System Health Science Center and vice chancellor for health affairs and the past president of the American Medical Association.

25:09.517 --> 25:17.128
one of the highest profile people certainly in our community and the person that you say is the smartest person that you've ever known.

25:17.148 --> 25:17.929
Talk about your wife.

25:17.989 --> 25:20.532
I know you're very proud of her accomplishments.

25:20.552 --> 25:23.056
She is the love of my life.

25:23.296 --> 25:26.521
I hope I can keep from getting emotional here.

25:26.781 --> 25:27.882
That's okay.

25:29.785 --> 25:32.969
She has always been my best friend.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.693
She's always been my mentor.

25:36.554 --> 25:36.975
We

25:37.597 --> 25:41.261
have had 35 wonderful years, and we're working on another 35.

25:43.603 --> 25:46.006
She has supported me.

25:46.026 --> 25:48.568
She's been my team doctor.

25:48.728 --> 25:55.335
She sat in the stands and listened to people begrudge me sometimes using bad language.

25:55.395 --> 26:02.963
But no, she's the mother of three wonderful children, and our family is, my life couldn't be much better.

26:04.023 --> 26:04.484
Indeed.

26:04.504 --> 26:14.318
She's obviously one of the most highest profile members of our community, but you know her as a wife and a mom, and I know that she regards that as her most important role.

26:14.798 --> 26:18.003
She certainly does, although she doesn't do bad in the other arena.

26:18.163 --> 26:18.464
Indeed.

26:18.924 --> 26:25.574
Danielle Marie Wilson-Travis, your son who is in Iraq right now, and Elizabeth, I know are your children.

26:25.594 --> 26:26.856
You're very, very proud of them.

26:26.896 --> 26:33.405
I wish we had more time to talk about what they're doing, but I want to thank you very much for your service, and I appreciate you being with us today.

26:33.385 --> 26:34.226
Thank you, Tom.

26:34.246 --> 26:34.566
All right.

26:34.687 --> 26:35.067
Thank you.

26:35.748 --> 26:40.153
More than 47,000 American military died as a result of hostilities in Vietnam.

26:40.173 --> 26:41.255
30,000 were Army.

26:41.735 --> 26:43.898
70% of those were Army infantry.

26:43.998 --> 26:50.787
Frank Dickey understands his fortune to have come home, to have met and married Nancy, and to have been able to raise their three fine children.

26:50.847 --> 26:54.972
Vietnam is a war that historians will debate as long as there is history.

26:55.255 --> 27:01.005
But few will ever debate the bravery of those who sacrificed their most vital years to protect our freedoms.

27:01.025 --> 27:04.211
We salute Frank Dickey for his service, and we thank all veterans.

27:04.592 --> 27:06.315
I'm Tom Turveyville for Frank Dickey.

27:06.355 --> 27:09.180
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:21.968 --> 27:22.930
.

27:22.950 --> 27:39.876
.
