00:38.197 --> 00:40.575
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.995 --> 00:42.137
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:42.826 --> 00:55.504
If you read Harold Moore's book, We Were Soldiers Once and Young, or even if you just saw the magnificent Mel Gibson motion picture, We Were Soldiers, then you already have a glimpse of the real-life story you are about to hear.

00:55.524 --> 01:01.573
Captain Ron Lewis served his country as a helicopter pilot, assigned to lift duty for Cav 1 in Vietnam.

01:01.954 --> 01:12.529
His ship flew low and fast over the jungles, settling down in landing zones that barely existed, dropping off soldiers and picking up soldiers, hopefully alive, but too many times not.

01:13.032 --> 01:18.858
Today, Captain Ron Lewis is the director for the Center of Student Development at Blinn College, A&M grad class of 1964.

01:19.899 --> 01:24.765
He's quick to tell you that his service was no more gallant than any other soldier of that war.

01:25.325 --> 01:27.888
It is nonetheless a remarkable story.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.731
Captain Lewis, welcome.

01:30.751 --> 01:31.272
Well, thank you.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.515
There is so much to tell about your story as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam.

01:34.535 --> 01:36.698
We're going to go ahead and fast forward to your first day.

01:37.419 --> 01:39.821
Pleiku, Vietnam, that's where you were stationed.

01:39.841 --> 01:42.364
But your very first night there, you were

01:42.766 --> 01:46.511
You got the experience of Vietnam very quickly, actually in your first three nights.

01:46.571 --> 01:49.495
Take us right to your first day at Vietnam.

01:49.515 --> 01:51.418
Well, Tom, I arrived at Pleiku.

01:51.458 --> 01:57.727
I was assigned to the 1st Cav Division, B Troop, 1st Cavalry, 9th Squadron.

01:57.847 --> 02:03.214
We were actually stationed at An K, and Pleiku was the pickup point.

02:03.234 --> 02:08.161
So when I got to Pleiku, I was one of the first replacements for the 1st Cav.

02:08.221 --> 02:10.444
It had arrived there about a year before I did.

02:10.981 --> 02:13.263
And the guys were ready to come home.

02:13.283 --> 02:14.744
They had served out their time.

02:14.764 --> 02:18.548
They'd been through the battle that you mentioned that was chronicled in Colonel Moore's book.

02:19.669 --> 02:24.073
All of the replacements that we replaced talked about that battle often.

02:24.153 --> 02:33.041
And when we would fly over areas where it took place, for example, LZ X-ray, which you were familiar with from the movie, they would look down and say, that's LZ X-ray.

02:33.461 --> 02:40.127
And usually with a great deal of emotion about it.

02:40.343 --> 02:43.607
When I got there, the cab actually was out in the field.

02:43.887 --> 02:57.144
It was not in its base camp at Anke, so a young warrant officer carried me over, and I recall that we went over to the major base at Anke where the division was stationed, and he took me up to the top of the little hill.

02:57.164 --> 03:07.617
Now, when the cab got there, it was nothing more than jungle, and they had to fight their way and carve their way out of the jungle, and many of them had gone down into the town and had bought with their own money

03:07.833 --> 03:12.731
materials to buy what they called hooches, which was little more than just a little square shack.

03:12.831 --> 03:16.324
Looked like a chicken coop, basically, that they lived in.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.552
So he carried me up to one of the guy's hooches.

03:18.920 --> 03:48.927
and there was a cot in there and I recall it was getting late in the day and we stood on a mountain top or a long hill close to the division and we looked down this long grade and down the grade you could see that it had been cleared and there was the perimeter which had telephone poles and barbed wire and concertina and guard towers around it with machine gun emplacements and he had been there a good while and one of the things that veterans do

03:49.143 --> 03:51.969
is they try to scare you when you can't come in.

03:52.049 --> 03:58.623
And he was he was accomplished at doing that because he looked down the hill and we looked out into the jungle, which I couldn't see.

03:58.643 --> 04:00.147
And of course, I was green as a gourd.

04:01.149 --> 04:03.434
And he said, yep.

04:03.454 --> 04:06.159
And he shook his head and he said, Charlie's out there.

04:07.081 --> 04:07.422
Well,

04:07.840 --> 04:30.017
you know my blood just kind of ran. I looked for Charlie. I couldn't see him in the jungle and then he took me up to the hooch and he said, well we'll have breakfast in the morning and then we'll go out to the camp. So I spent the night by myself in the hooch, and I had a 38 caliber revolver which they issued to all of the pilots. It was a little six shot four inch barrel job that was my arm at the time.

04:30.655 --> 04:33.603
And I remember all night long the artillery going off.

04:33.623 --> 04:37.613
And of course, when you're green, you can't really tell the difference between outgoing and incoming.

04:37.854 --> 04:40.902
So every time one of the big guns would go boom, I would jump.

04:41.557 --> 04:46.842
They fired flares on the perimeter all night long, so I got very little sleep that night.

04:46.862 --> 04:55.591
I was very glad when morning came the next morning, and we were able to go down and have breakfast, and at least I had somebody around then that could kind of tell me what was going on.

04:56.011 --> 05:00.796
Because you see, you can't tell whether to be afraid or not when you're in a situation like that.

05:00.816 --> 05:05.821
You don't want to act like a coward, but neither do you want to let a serious situation escape.

05:06.081 --> 05:11.226
What I found out was I was very, very safe that night, but I didn't know it at the time.

05:11.206 --> 05:12.047
Your second night.

05:12.928 --> 05:14.370
Well, the next day.

05:14.390 --> 05:16.854
You had an orientation flight, I believe, the next day, right?

05:16.874 --> 05:25.285
Yes, the next day we flew out to Contum, which is where the squadron that I was attached to was operating out of.

05:25.325 --> 05:30.372
And we were a recon squadron, so we had scouts and we had gunships and we had a lift section.

05:30.933 --> 05:36.741
We had a platoon that stayed with us all the time, a platoon of infantry that did scouting activities for us.

05:37.312 --> 05:46.687
The activities that we did is we would carry the platoon in and put them down, and then if we suspected any enemy involvement somewhere, they would go check it out.

05:46.707 --> 05:51.735
And if they ran into the enemy, then we would fly in reinforcements.

05:51.755 --> 05:54.699
If not, then we would go pick them up at the end of the time.

05:54.759 --> 05:58.385
So they were in contum doing some of that.

05:58.405 --> 06:04.855
And the section leader, I was assigned to the lift section, and the section leader came in and told me that he wanted to take me on an orientation flight.

06:05.206 --> 06:08.029
Now, understand, too, that I just graduated from flight school.

06:08.569 --> 06:13.674
So, again, being green really does not describe a recent graduate of flight school.

06:15.135 --> 06:20.920
The school is magnificent, but you're ill-prepared for the kinds of things that you face in a situation like that.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.643
For example, you were used to flying 25 to 30 feet above the ground.

06:23.663 --> 06:25.044
You found out that was way too high.

06:25.164 --> 06:35.213
Well, we did what they called nap of the earth flying, and nap of the earth meant that you were as low on the deck as you could get, and you could use trees and hills and that kind of thing to screen.

06:35.193 --> 06:37.957
if you came under fire.

06:38.237 --> 06:43.344
In flight school, they taught us to do that about 30 feet off the ground, and we would follow the contour of the ground.

06:43.505 --> 06:57.184
When he took me out on that flight, we were dragging our skids through the treetops and dipping down so close to the ground, we were about six inches, the way it looked to me, and quite frankly, he scared me really bad.

06:57.244 --> 07:03.833
We flew down to Pleiku, as I recall, and we were on our way back, and he was just kind of giving me an orientation of the area.

07:03.813 --> 07:09.080
And on the way back, suddenly the radio traffic began to pick up.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.927
And we found out that one of our scout ships had actually been shot down.

07:13.947 --> 07:17.733
And so the troop commander was calling for us to get back as quickly as we could.

07:17.773 --> 07:19.936
He wanted to insert the infantry platoon.

07:20.396 --> 07:25.323
Now, understand that I'm flying now with the lead ship in the lift.

07:25.624 --> 07:27.346
We flew in to Contum.

07:27.366 --> 07:31.592
We picked up the platoon as fast as we could, which really only took us about 20 minutes.

07:32.062 --> 07:34.633
and we went to the area where the ship had been downed.

07:35.476 --> 07:41.903
As I recall as we approached, when you look at a battle, it has a kind of a different look to it.

07:42.153 --> 07:45.818
airplanes going in, dropping 500-pound bombs.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.101
Artillery was being called into the area.

07:48.161 --> 07:52.508
Our gunships were placing rockets and machine gun fire in the area.

07:52.528 --> 07:55.271
So it has kind of a haze to it that's caused by the smoke.

07:55.892 --> 08:00.238
It was getting late in the day around dusk, so the sun was going down.

08:01.480 --> 08:10.573
It probably was around 5 o'clock when we started in and with the platoon that was going to go in and try to get our guys out that had been shot down.

08:11.161 --> 08:13.164
Infantry platoon was magnificent.

08:13.264 --> 08:15.608
Never hesitated to go in.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.350
A platoon has about 30 men in it.

08:17.390 --> 08:20.475
We had a five ship formation that was going in.

08:20.515 --> 08:21.777
So we were flying the lead.

08:22.378 --> 08:27.786
I was on an orientation flight, so I was trying to get as much from it as I could and learn something.

08:27.766 --> 08:31.773
As we were going in, I recall I kept asking him, where's the LZ?

08:31.953 --> 08:33.676
LZ stands for landing zone.

08:33.696 --> 08:35.499
That's where we were going to land.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.002
And he kept saying, it's right there.

08:37.122 --> 08:37.743
It's right there.

08:37.803 --> 08:40.067
And I kept looking and I kept saying, where is it?

08:40.307 --> 08:41.429
And he said, it's right there.

08:41.449 --> 08:41.990
It's right there.

08:42.471 --> 08:46.698
Then as we got on short final, he looks over at me and he says, I want you to get close to the controls.

08:46.758 --> 08:47.800
Put your feet on the pedals.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.874
They're called pedals in a helicopter.

08:50.515 --> 08:59.204
The cyclic is the main stick, and the collective is what you use to control your climb and descent.

08:59.224 --> 09:03.948
So I did, and then he said, if I get shot, you fly us out.

09:03.968 --> 09:05.910
Right away, I knew that was serious business.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.832
So I tensed up.

09:07.852 --> 09:16.200
One of the guys in the rear behind us who was coming in was new like I was, and the stick, the cyclic on the...

09:16.180 --> 09:18.823
Huey has a button that you push.

09:19.383 --> 09:24.409
If you push it one click, you talking intercom, you go two clicks and it goes out on the radio.

09:24.789 --> 09:30.295
It was not uncommon for pilots to get in tight situations and just grip it tightly.

09:30.375 --> 09:34.600
And so you'd oftentimes hear things on the radio that was just meant for the inner crew.

09:35.541 --> 09:39.485
And he looked at his pilot and he said, I don't know about you, but this scares the hell out of me.

09:39.525 --> 09:42.988
And that pretty much summed up the way I was feeling at the time.

09:43.008 --> 09:45.411
We were seeing these tracers go by

09:45.391 --> 09:51.820
And of course the artillery was dropping and our gunships were putting in rocket fire close by.

09:52.601 --> 09:56.186
We dropped in and we dropped the infantry platoon off.

09:56.206 --> 10:03.536
And what I remember about that is I'm sitting in the right hand seat and as I look out, they just kind of disappeared.

10:03.756 --> 10:06.921
They left the ship, they went into the jungle.

10:07.241 --> 10:11.687
We pulled out and as we did, we circled around, we watched our other ships go in and deposit their load.

10:11.707 --> 10:15.212
There was only enough room for one at a time in the LZ.

10:15.192 --> 10:22.122
which, and you were absolutely correct, I never would have selected that as a place where a helicopter could land.

10:22.162 --> 10:26.749
We was on the side of a mountain, a deep, you know, quite a slope.

10:27.731 --> 10:29.033
But they got out and they left.

10:29.073 --> 10:39.929
So we went and as was our, you know, normal procedure circled about waiting, you know, for them to finish their job so we could go back in and pick them up.

10:39.949 --> 10:44.035
During that time, we understood, we realized that the pilots had been killed

10:44.977 --> 10:52.189
So they fought their way into the downed helicopter and recovered the bodies and then brought them back to the LZ.

10:53.231 --> 10:56.536
By the time they did that, it was getting closer to dark.

10:57.037 --> 10:58.139
It was dusk.

10:58.159 --> 11:01.104
And then we were given the word to go back in and pick them up.

11:01.124 --> 11:04.570
So we went back into the same LZ.

11:04.590 --> 11:06.132
I remember we landed.

11:06.152 --> 11:09.077
They were not visible as we came in.

11:09.057 --> 11:13.542
As soon as we landed, they just kind of appeared from the sides of the jungle, ran for the ship.

11:14.363 --> 11:16.085
They brought the two bodies on board.

11:16.105 --> 11:19.289
They had them in body bags, and so we put them on board the ship.

11:19.429 --> 11:23.033
They put them on board the ship, and then we pulled out.

11:23.413 --> 11:34.626
During this time period, I realized these guys were doing things with that helicopter that I was totally unequipped to do, that I knew I couldn't fly like that.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.393
We got back, we deposited the bodies.

11:37.413 --> 11:41.242
When we got back to the camp at Contoum, it was after dark.

11:41.883 --> 11:48.859
Now, I had brought my gear out in a duffel bag and I'd put it down in the field as we'd landed.

11:48.879 --> 11:54.572
My expectation was that I'd go find my duffel bag, get my sleeping bag in my little tent and set it up.

11:54.552 --> 11:55.554
I couldn't find it.

11:56.074 --> 11:59.640
So that night I had to spend sleeping on a helicopter.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.082
Which they had advised you not to do.

12:01.102 --> 12:06.991
They told me that was a no-no because if we got hit, that's the place that they would try for.

12:07.111 --> 12:09.235
But really, there was no other place.

12:09.275 --> 12:12.780
It rained every night, so there was a little bit of a shelter.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.783
you know, in the helicopter.

12:14.863 --> 12:17.287
Well, obviously I didn't sleep very well that night either.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.854
Once again, the artillery and the flares and that sort of thing was going on.

12:21.954 --> 12:23.757
So that was my first two days.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.759
Yeah, that was your first two days.

12:24.859 --> 12:25.079
Right.

12:25.099 --> 12:27.863
And then you moved not too much farther than that.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.708
First off, first CAV or CAV-1, that's an air mobile group.

12:30.848 --> 12:31.329
It's an air mobile.

12:31.349 --> 12:38.640
And the design of that is to pick up troops, pick up companies and move them out quickly from one spot to another.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.523
Our squadron was capable

12:40.807 --> 12:44.632
of loading within about a three-hour period, we can move the entire squadron.

12:44.913 --> 12:45.113
All right.

12:45.133 --> 12:49.720
So you get an order to move and you're headed to the coast and this is your next crisis.

12:49.780 --> 12:50.120
That's right.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.622
And it's like day three or day four.

12:51.923 --> 12:59.173
But it's very important because I want you to talk about it because it was really your first realization of what's meant about the Fellowship of Soldiers.

12:59.313 --> 13:00.655
That's correct.

13:00.635 --> 13:04.521
we had gotten word that there was a big battle going on on the coast.

13:04.902 --> 13:07.105
And so oftentimes that's the way we move.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.831
We'd get a rumor that there was a battle and then a word would come down that we were to move.

13:11.572 --> 13:18.964
So we had the orders to move to the coast, pulled up stakes, we pulled up our tents, we loaded our helicopters, we loaded everything in it.

13:18.984 --> 13:22.048
We had infantry on board and all of our gear.

13:22.569 --> 13:27.196
And I was flying with a warrant officer who had been there for a good while.

13:27.257 --> 13:28.819
And I explained to you earlier,

13:29.170 --> 13:33.577
that guys that had been there really did not like to fly with us, with the new guys.

13:33.597 --> 13:39.306
They felt like we were there for one purpose, and that was to kill them before they got a chance to go home.

13:39.326 --> 13:42.030
And in many respects, that wasn't too far from the truth.

13:42.972 --> 13:45.976
So he was kind of grumpy.

13:46.317 --> 13:48.981
But anyway, we were flying, going to the coast.

13:49.001 --> 13:51.465
We were about 3,500 feet, as I recall.

13:51.968 --> 13:55.652
when we heard a thump, which was around hitting the helicopter.

13:55.672 --> 13:56.693
And he knew what that was.

13:56.773 --> 13:58.655
I'd, you know, I'd never heard that before.

13:58.735 --> 14:03.740
So I really, I just heard the thump and wondered, and I actually had the controls.

14:04.641 --> 14:12.228
The first indication I got was when he began to tense up a little bit, I saw him, you know, tense and, and he reached for the controls and he said, I've got it.

14:12.789 --> 14:19.275
And so being more experienced than I was, obviously he had it and I was very glad to turn it over to him.

14:19.677 --> 14:25.866
He immediately put us into an auto rotation in a dive as much as you can get in a helicopter.

14:25.886 --> 14:33.156
We were coming down about 95 knots in a full auto rotation, which means there's no pitch in the blade, so you have no lift.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.962
You're basically falling out of the air.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.485
And as I looked, I tried to figure out what was going on.

14:39.906 --> 14:47.777
I noticed that the major caution light was on, and the Huey has a master caution that comes on, and then you have a little panel you look at

14:48.027 --> 14:49.509
where it'll tell you what's wrong.

14:49.749 --> 14:52.152
And your first indication is that master caution.

14:52.873 --> 14:54.215
Master caution light was on.

14:54.295 --> 14:59.542
I looked down and I saw it was transmission oil pressure that we were losing or had lost.

14:59.562 --> 15:10.717
And so they taught us in flight school, you had 90 seconds from the time that you lost transmission oil pressure, then you needed to be on the ground because it was going to freeze up and quit flying.

15:11.157 --> 15:14.862
So he was, he had already, you know, obviously been more skilled than I.

15:15.196 --> 15:22.687
had caught it and had started down, and we were in a fast descent to the ground.

15:23.649 --> 15:27.394
And basically what I was doing then is just monitoring the gauges and watching.

15:27.475 --> 15:29.558
So we came out of the sky.

15:29.578 --> 15:30.800
He made a stiff turn.

15:30.900 --> 15:35.807
He picked a landing spot, and it happened to be on a sandbar in a river, which was fairly large.

15:36.488 --> 15:39.553
And so we came out fast.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.676
It came down fast.

15:41.977 --> 15:49.046
got to the ground, he landed the ship, and we started shutdown procedures immediately.

15:49.106 --> 15:56.275
When we got to the ground, the infantry that we had on board, who were all veterans, knew what to do.

15:56.295 --> 15:59.819
They got off and they started setting up a perimeter immediately.

15:59.839 --> 16:06.127
So what was left for me to do was to unstrap and get out of the helicopter.

16:06.187 --> 16:06.668
I remember

16:07.120 --> 16:12.719
When I opened the door and I stepped out, and again, being green, I had no idea what to expect.

16:12.799 --> 16:13.983
I didn't know what was going on.

16:14.023 --> 16:16.050
I didn't even know what to do.

16:16.756 --> 16:26.751
I turned around, and as I looked to the rear, our guys were in a full combat assault landing behind us.

16:26.771 --> 16:29.676
And you've seen that in the movies.

16:29.976 --> 16:37.808
It's quite an experience to look back and see those helicopters coming in with those infantrymen on the skids, and they're ready to get out.

16:37.828 --> 16:44.198
Now, we were not taking fire, but there was always that concern when you were in the jungle like that.

16:44.566 --> 16:49.272
So they landed, they hit the ground, they set up a perimeter immediately.

16:49.532 --> 16:57.022
And I told you that was kind of the first indication or first experience I had of feeling what I call the camaraderie of combat.

16:57.583 --> 17:03.891
It's the idea that a person, another person is actually gonna risk their life to help you.

17:03.911 --> 17:06.615
And it's a powerful, powerful feeling.

17:06.635 --> 17:12.362
And we had that a lot in the company troop that I was in because we had to do that a lot.

17:12.342 --> 17:17.199
In the book by Joe Galloway and Hal Moore, we were soldiers once and young.

17:17.620 --> 17:22.738
Moore writes, American soldiers in battle don't fight for what some president says on TV.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.086
They don't fight for mom, apple pie.

17:25.403 --> 17:28.147
the American flag, they fight for one another.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.008
He wrote that in the book.

17:29.288 --> 17:31.932
And you could see that with that experience.

17:31.952 --> 17:33.915
Those are very good words.

17:33.935 --> 17:43.108
And the camaraderie that we felt, because I really think the guys that we flew around with, we carried the same people most of the time.

17:43.088 --> 17:45.455
they knew that we'd come in and get them.

17:46.718 --> 17:54.079
You know, and we were talking sometime later in my experience, which was about, well, I guess we back up now.

17:54.099 --> 17:56.706
We're three days into my tour.

17:56.806 --> 17:58.110
I've already...

17:58.090 --> 18:02.057
seen a ship shot down or been involved in a shoot down.

18:02.157 --> 18:03.539
I've been shot down myself.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.544
We have medevaced dead pilots.

18:07.105 --> 18:08.948
I've not slept for three days.

18:10.471 --> 18:14.898
And I was thinking at the time, I was a pretty depressed young man at the time.

18:15.038 --> 18:23.693
I was concerned about whether or not this was survival or not, survivable or not.

18:23.673 --> 18:28.605
But at any rate, we went on and we did assimilate.

18:29.347 --> 18:31.974
After a while, they assigned me a co-pilot.

18:31.994 --> 18:34.520
We had a co-pilot and I was flying with another new guy.

18:34.741 --> 18:41.057
And this really felt more comfortable than with the veterans because we were more at the same skill level.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.419
So we helped each other.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.020
Right.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.826
But we moved back into the area where that battle took place.

18:46.846 --> 18:49.830
This was at a special forces camp outside of Plamey.

18:50.611 --> 18:57.662
The mountain was Chupong Mountain, the Idrang River Valley, which was well known in the annals of the 1st Cav Division.

18:58.385 --> 19:01.489
And the idea was we were going to go back in.

19:01.549 --> 19:03.251
It was close to the Cambodian border.

19:03.311 --> 19:10.920
So they were sending supplies across, and we were trying to interdict those supplies and catch the soldiers as they came across.

19:10.981 --> 19:14.765
And we knew that they used that as a trail often.

19:14.785 --> 19:21.734
So we were going to set the platoon down in the Ajang Valley, and they were going to set up along a trail.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.118
The plan was that they would set up and pull off an ambush.

19:25.402 --> 19:28.967
So we were attempting to ambush the North Vietnamese as they came across.

19:29.527 --> 19:31.710
We were going to set them down in the late afternoon.

19:32.251 --> 19:46.009
If the ambush went as planned, then the platoon was going to divide into singles and double soldiers, and they were going to infiltrate back to the I Drang, and then the next morning we were going to pick them up.

19:46.394 --> 19:55.773
We went out that night, late that afternoon, and started making false landings to try to throw the enemy off as to where they would be.

19:55.793 --> 20:04.150
And what we'd do is we'd fly into an area, act like we were landing, and then come out, and then go someplace else.

20:04.130 --> 20:07.595
And we did, and we dropped them into a landing zone.

20:07.615 --> 20:18.070
Now, my mindset was when we dropped them that I was going to go back to play me, and I'd be spending the night there and sleeping a peaceful night, and the next morning we'd get up and go pick them up.

20:18.090 --> 20:18.791
It didn't work out that way.

20:18.811 --> 20:20.554
It didn't work out that way.

20:20.574 --> 20:28.765
When we dropped them on the ground, it wasn't more than 10 minutes until they captured a North Vietnamese soldier that was coming down the trail.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.369
They had an interpreter with them,

20:32.024 --> 20:37.233
And the interpreter questioned the soldier and essentially he was laughed at.

20:37.574 --> 20:47.732
He was told that they were in the midst of a battalion size unit of North Vietnamese and they were at headquarters and there were soldiers all around them.

20:47.752 --> 20:50.937
So we knew they were in trouble.

20:50.957 --> 20:53.121
They started taking fire almost immediately.

20:53.506 --> 20:59.132
And our company commander knew if he left them on the ground, they weren't going to survive the night.

20:59.972 --> 21:02.034
So we were ordered to go back in and pick them up.

21:02.915 --> 21:08.601
It was a terrifying extraction that night for me in that we went in after dark.

21:09.462 --> 21:11.304
We had to pick them up from a bomb crater.

21:12.225 --> 21:15.688
The thing that they guided us in with was a flashlight.

21:16.589 --> 21:20.813
And to fly a helicopter in the dark of night,

21:21.181 --> 21:29.632
and find a landing zone, guiding on a flashlight is not the most gratifying experience you'd ever like to have.

21:29.652 --> 21:31.915
So that was another issue.

21:32.216 --> 21:38.784
But I think that our guys knew that we were gonna come after them no matter where they were or what the situation was.

21:38.804 --> 21:40.827
And I think you described it as a matter of fact,

21:41.195 --> 21:44.279
At night in Vietnam is like being in the inside of a bowling ball.

21:44.299 --> 21:47.743
Yes, that's right, because there are no lights on the ground.

21:47.763 --> 21:51.268
So you're pretty much on instruments and looking.

21:51.288 --> 21:56.334
And I think the most dangerous thing, really, is mid-air collisions.

21:56.354 --> 21:56.514
Right.

21:56.534 --> 22:10.712
Because if you're in a situation where you've got other ships flying around, whether they be the Air Force craft or your gunships or other kinds of ships, then you have to be very careful about collisions in that situation.

22:10.692 --> 22:15.149
I want to, Captain Lewis, go to some photographs that you have supplied.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.719
These are photographs that you actually took during this time.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.293
A lot of them are from your ship when we're ready to go.

22:21.931 --> 22:23.193
Describe what we're looking at now.

22:23.253 --> 22:27.719
This is your Huey Model D that you... That was my Model D. That was my list ship.

22:28.340 --> 22:32.526
This one is identifiable by the square on the door.

22:32.806 --> 22:35.289
All of our ships had squares on the door like that.

22:35.309 --> 22:39.115
That was the B Troop Signif.

22:40.156 --> 22:41.859
What am I trying to say here?

22:41.879 --> 22:42.419
Insignia.

22:42.660 --> 22:42.960
Right.

22:42.940 --> 22:47.085
On this one, you see soldiers kind of lounging around.

22:47.125 --> 22:54.454
That was our infantry platoon, and they spent a lot of time doing that when they weren't actually out on a scout mission.

22:55.275 --> 22:58.179
But we were ready to go whenever they were called.

22:58.199 --> 23:00.923
And continue our little makeshift slideshow here.

23:00.943 --> 23:04.527
Okay, and that's yours truly.

23:04.507 --> 23:05.830
We're flying.

23:05.870 --> 23:12.888
My co-pilot took that picture and we used to swap cameras back and forth so we could take pictures of each other when not much was going on.

23:12.908 --> 23:16.356
So we did want to have a chronicle that we were actually there flying.

23:17.753 --> 23:20.476
Now, this is a remarkable picture to me.

23:20.496 --> 23:23.979
This is the actual of the troops coming onto your chopper.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.040
That's correct.

23:25.080 --> 23:25.961
From battle, I guess.

23:26.061 --> 23:40.916
Yes, we're in a landing zone there, and frankly, I don't remember the exact circumstances of this particular landing zone, but I shot that from the pilot's seat, and they're coming to get on to be taken out.

23:41.657 --> 23:43.218
As you can see there in a movie.

23:43.438 --> 23:45.060
What kind of camera were you using?

23:45.395 --> 23:48.018
I used a little Minolta, 35 millimeter.

23:48.699 --> 23:53.465
All of us had cameras, so this was a... And this?

23:53.485 --> 23:54.306
I'm sorry.

23:54.326 --> 23:57.850
Here you can see some soldiers lined up along the levee.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.474
They're under fire and we're flying over.

24:01.195 --> 24:03.818
And I snapped this just as we went over.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.441
Remarkable photograph.

24:07.568 --> 24:09.851
There you are checking out some damage on your Huey.

24:10.032 --> 24:14.838
Yes, this looks like a shot that we took.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.422
And so we're looking this over.

24:17.542 --> 24:20.727
As I was telling you, the most vulnerable part of the Huey is the pilot.

24:21.488 --> 24:24.692
And so they would try to target the pilot.

24:24.773 --> 24:30.741
And you can see this is not too far from the pilot's compartment where we took this hit.

24:33.303 --> 24:38.549
Talking about landing zones, I guess what we're looking at now is a pretty good landing zone compared to some of the things.

24:38.589 --> 24:48.680
Well, there are several in here that would be fairly good, but this is kind of a typical picture of the terrain and the stream bed with the trees.

24:49.040 --> 24:57.049
And the Vietnamese would go out and carve out rice paddies out of the trees, so you'd see them in some very unusual places.

24:59.510 --> 25:03.373
There's a photograph with the... Okay, now this is a picture.

25:03.734 --> 25:06.056
If you can, you're the pilot in the Huey.

25:06.076 --> 25:07.837
You're going into a landing zone.

25:08.498 --> 25:14.583
Your aircraft on the side, your gunships are going in, laying down a suppressing fire for you.

25:15.544 --> 25:23.291
When the rockets and the artillery go in, they don't make this big fiery ball that you see on television.

25:23.431 --> 25:27.795
Usually what you see is a little smoke and a little dust, and of course you can't see the shrapnel.

25:27.775 --> 25:35.564
But that area there where you see the smoke would be a terrible area to be in because the shrapnel is tearing that place up.

25:35.584 --> 25:38.828
We're going to move on because, believe it or not, we're almost running out of time.

25:38.848 --> 25:40.790
This is just one of the camps, is that right?

25:40.970 --> 25:42.372
That's a Vietnamese village.

25:42.392 --> 25:45.696
That would be a Montagnard village in the central highlands.

25:46.056 --> 25:49.079
And that was pretty typical of the kind of villages that you'd see.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.163
Those houses, I don't know that you can tell here, are on stilts.

25:52.717 --> 25:58.207
And actually, they had troubles with tigers and others sometimes coming into the village and tearing people off.

25:58.227 --> 25:59.550
There you are on Christmas?

25:59.570 --> 26:00.932
That's on Christmas 1966.

26:01.874 --> 26:04.419
And what I'm doing there is I'm sitting in front of my tent.

26:04.599 --> 26:06.843
You can see the tent in the background.

26:06.863 --> 26:08.987
And I'm opening a present that I got from home.

26:10.064 --> 26:11.025
Very special one, too.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.427
And here's our final picture.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.289
And this one is kind of dear to me.

26:15.010 --> 26:21.216
I was telling you, when I went back through my slides, I was surprised at the numbers of pictures that I had of children.

26:21.236 --> 26:24.480
American soldiers really opened their heart to kids.

26:25.061 --> 26:30.827
If you hear stories about soldiers mistreating kids in foreign battlefields, that's not true.

26:31.308 --> 26:38.856
In this particular one, one of the soldiers had written back home and had gotten a box of clothes that I think his church had collected.

26:38.836 --> 26:45.531
And we were out in the village or at the edge of the village giving those to the children.

26:45.551 --> 26:45.893
Indeed.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.050
Some remarkable photographs indeed.

26:50.292 --> 26:53.317
Stand Down Day wasn't always great for you.

26:53.357 --> 26:55.601
Talk about, real quick, we're running out of time.

26:55.621 --> 26:57.103
We've only got about a minute and a half left.

26:57.123 --> 26:58.545
Talk about Stand Down Day.

26:58.585 --> 27:04.515
Yeah, the one that I remember most, and I used to hate those days, we would have what we'd call stand downs.

27:04.555 --> 27:06.819
Stand downs were like a holiday.

27:06.839 --> 27:10.665
It was like a weekend or a Saturday because, actually,

27:10.645 --> 27:14.491
Over there, I lost track of time because you didn't have the weekends to go on.

27:14.571 --> 27:23.965
So we'd have days when we were supposed to not do anything and clean our equipment and basically not have to worry about being shot.

27:23.985 --> 27:26.489
Almost invariably, things would happen.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.955
On one, we were sent back to Pleiku to pick up some mail.

27:30.616 --> 27:34.321
And Smitty and I, who's my co-pilot, were in our ship.

27:34.381 --> 27:36.184
And we'd gone back, and we were coming back.

27:36.224 --> 27:38.087
We had, I think, four soldiers on board.

27:38.810 --> 27:41.655
And one of our ships was shot down.

27:41.675 --> 27:49.831
And because we were unloaded, we had room, then we were the one that was selected to go in and pick them up.

27:49.851 --> 27:55.842
So we had to make a very hazardous, under-fire landing to get those guys out.

27:55.862 --> 27:56.484
But we did.

27:56.544 --> 28:00.611
We managed to get them out, and the whole troop was involved, and it was quite an experience.

28:00.631 --> 28:01.493
Indeed.

28:02.249 --> 28:05.053
27 and a half minutes goes by so very, very fast.

28:05.093 --> 28:09.900
We could talk so much more about your experience and your service, but thank you very much for your service.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.540
Well, thank you.

28:10.621 --> 28:11.962
I appreciate what you're doing.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.324
Captain Ron Lewis, thank you very much.

28:13.725 --> 28:26.282
World War II veterans are called part of the greatest generation, and maybe they are, but the bravest generation, no, that title must be equally shared by all men and women who have gone in harm's way for our freedoms.

28:27.157 --> 28:29.343
You've had the honor of meeting one of those today.

28:29.383 --> 28:35.019
And we salute and thank Captain Ron Lewis, Vietnam Chopper Pilot, Cav One, Aggie Class of 64.

28:35.661 --> 28:36.764
Please thank a veteran today.

28:37.345 --> 28:39.993
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

28:40.013 --> 28:40.975
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:40.995 --> 28:43.582
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
