00:30.485 --> 00:34.305
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.387
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.565 --> 00:40.189
John Milhollan was uncertain of his career path when he was a youth.

00:41.030 --> 00:44.414
He thought about being a preacher, about being a Boy Scout leader.

00:44.434 --> 00:52.363
Then he and a buddy started watching aircraft, watching them land, watching them take off from Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma, and he was hooked.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.347
Went home, told his wife he decided to be a pilot.

00:55.367 --> 00:58.050
He was going to join the Air Force and he was going to fly.

00:58.722 --> 01:04.129
Let's fast forward to 1965 when he graduated as second lieutenant from OTS in San Antonio.

01:04.710 --> 01:10.237
In March of 1966, he was a fighter pilot, a top gun, strapped to the back of an F-4.

01:10.998 --> 01:18.167
Christmas Day, 1966, Lieutenant John Milhollan arrived in Da Nang, a hot spot of the Vietnam War.

01:18.928 --> 01:21.811
Lieutenant John Milhollan, welcome, and thank you for your service.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.276
First off, we've set the stage for your story in Vietnam.

01:25.776 --> 01:26.417
You take it from there.

01:27.241 --> 01:34.812
Well, Tom, first of all, I wanted to say what an honor it was to be here and be part of this program, and I appreciate being asked.

01:35.933 --> 01:47.109
It's hard to go back these 30-some-odd years and remember all the details, but many of the things stick very strongly in your mind, and I'll try to hit the highlights with you.

01:48.190 --> 01:55.020
I arrived in country at Da Nang on Christmas Day, or actually the day before on the 24th,

01:55.152 --> 02:07.811
And the ironic thing about that was that Bob Hope had his Christmas show at Da Nang on the 24th and came to Saigon on the 25th.

02:07.911 --> 02:12.318
And so I passed him in the air and missed the entire Bob Hope Christmas show.

02:12.338 --> 02:15.863
So I never got to see it live, but I always enjoyed those.

02:16.584 --> 02:21.852
But arriving in country from then until...

02:22.169 --> 02:28.686
A fateful day in April, we were flying F-4 missions over North Vietnam.

02:28.706 --> 02:39.013
I had 66 missions over North Vietnam when in April of 23rd of 1967 was just a normal day.

02:39.652 --> 02:43.016
We got up, we had a mission over North Vietnam.

02:43.056 --> 02:45.459
We were going to be what we call a CAP mission.

02:46.260 --> 02:56.752
And basically what that was, the F-105s, the Thunder Chiefs, did most of the striking at the bridges and the infrastructure of the North.

02:57.653 --> 03:00.917
And they were not quite as agile as the F-4s.

03:00.937 --> 03:04.721
So we flew what we call CAP over the top of them.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.503
While they were down dropping their bombs,

03:06.820 --> 03:15.278
we would actually fly over the top of them to protect them from MIGs and anything that might be a threat to them from the air.

03:15.764 --> 03:27.858
I want to stop you right there because what I'd like to do is go to some pictures so people can get an idea, sort of a visual of what we're talking about here as far as we've got you with your airplane and some other shots from you in Da Nang at your base in Da Nang.

03:27.898 --> 03:31.582
So here's the first shot of a young Lieutenant John Milhollan there.

03:31.622 --> 03:33.364
I guess that's in front of your F-4, right?

03:33.384 --> 03:37.209
Young and slender and standing in front of a F-4C model.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.974
Later additions include the E and the F model and the F-4.

03:42.545 --> 03:43.726
So this was in 1967.

03:44.107 --> 03:44.687
Let's move on.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.350
I think we've got a shot that you took from your porch, right?

03:47.370 --> 03:52.095
This is a picture of the base there at Da Nang, taken from the front porch of my hoots.

03:52.115 --> 03:59.062
The officer's club would be down on the left at the far end of the street, and the theater was directly across the street.

03:59.082 --> 03:59.703
And we'll move on.

03:59.723 --> 04:02.786
Now you get a really idea of just the pure size of this aircraft.

04:02.806 --> 04:07.491
It's hard to understand when people talk about fighter aircraft, the size of the actual aircraft.

04:07.511 --> 04:09.413
The F-4 could actually carry more

04:09.663 --> 04:16.371
bombs than the B-17s of the World War II era.

04:16.391 --> 04:21.417
They carry actually 17 500-pound bombs in a complete load.

04:22.478 --> 04:23.600
And then we got one more picture.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.502
There you are in front of the Officers Club.

04:25.522 --> 04:31.910
Yeah, we joked about the only Officers Club in the world open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

04:33.071 --> 04:33.572
Wow.

04:33.592 --> 04:34.793
Quite a place.

04:34.992 --> 04:39.865
That gives people a little bit of the idea of the visual of where you were in 1967.

04:40.106 --> 04:42.252
Now continue about this mission in April.

04:43.576 --> 04:46.303
Well, it was a normal mission, North Vietnam.

04:46.363 --> 04:50.655
We were doing the cap just as we got in the target area.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.912
we got a call from Big Eye.

04:52.932 --> 05:04.647
Now Big Eye is an AWAC aircraft that was flying out over the South China Sea, and they actually monitored the air battle over North Vietnam, and they called up and told us this Big Eye on guard.

05:04.667 --> 05:15.480
They had two unidentified aircraft taking off from an airport in North Vietnam, and that they were headed our direction.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.043
We immediately, at that point,

05:18.327 --> 05:28.202
pull the aircraft up and jettison the centerline tank that we were carrying so that we could maneuver more rapidly and started searching for the MiGs.

05:28.222 --> 05:35.653
When we had started out the day, we'd actually been a four ship, but one of the aircraft had to return to the name because they had mechanical problems.

05:36.134 --> 05:38.778
So we had three F4s in the flight.

05:39.539 --> 05:40.861
And where were you situated?

05:40.901 --> 05:41.742
We were number four.

05:42.063 --> 05:45.047
There was lead and then three and four.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.309
So two had gone home.

05:47.757 --> 05:57.750
When the two MiGs came in, they immediately realized, the MiGs did, that this was not 105s, but F4s, and they refused to stay and fight with F4s.

05:57.810 --> 06:06.601
So one of the MiGs broke low and into the weeds, and the next one broke high and into the sun, thinking that they could evade us.

06:06.621 --> 06:11.687
And it was actually a good day in that situation because both of the MiGs were shot down.

06:12.388 --> 06:16.093
Lead and three got a confirmed kill of the MiG that day.

06:16.968 --> 06:35.770
And as we were flying just northwest of Hanoi over the Red River at a little town called Yin Bay, we were about 8,500 feet, and it was sort of a congratulatory party over the radio as we were telling everybody a great deal, you know, how everything was going well.

06:37.319 --> 06:43.406
And all of a sudden, I told you that it reminded me of when I was in high school.

06:43.707 --> 06:48.913
I was driving down the highway, and I ran over a dog, and I felt this tremendous bump on the road.

06:48.933 --> 06:54.040
And then I stopped, and I couldn't find anybody that owned the poor dog, so I had to take it home and bury it.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.087
But here I am flying at 8,000 feet in an F-4 going 450 miles an hour.

07:00.539 --> 07:05.904
and felt a bump, and the first thought in my mind was, where did that dog come from up here?

07:06.885 --> 07:27.964
It didn't take me long, though, to realize that it was not a dog, but that we had been hit by probably an 85-millimeter shell, and what the North Vietnamese would do is they would simply see an airplane coming, and they would send two or three shells up into the sky, hoping that they would get close enough to hit an aircraft.

07:27.944 --> 07:29.666
So you were at a fairly low altitude here.

07:29.686 --> 07:30.888
Yes, we were at that point.

07:30.948 --> 07:42.885
We had gone down chasing the MiG down toward the ground, and so we were climbing up from about 500 or 600 feet when we actually got to about 8,000 feet, and that's where we felt the thump.

07:42.905 --> 07:56.905
Of course, we were still flying in a two-ship, and immediately after we got hit, there were two folks in the aircraft, and we started looking around to see what kind of systems were being affected.

07:57.138 --> 08:02.808
We got the burners lit, and we got the nose up, got the aircraft trimmed, so it was in a climb.

08:02.828 --> 08:07.176
And the other aircraft, of course, came back behind us and was monitoring our aircraft.

08:07.957 --> 08:19.638
They flew up underneath us, and they were calling out to us, you've got four basketball-sized holes in the bottom of the airplane, you've got three, and on and on and on, trying to help us understand what the situation was.

08:19.659 --> 08:19.939
But...

08:20.088 --> 08:28.950
At that point, we were still in the Red River Valley, and our objective was to get to the, actually it was to the northwest, up over the mountains,

08:29.200 --> 08:39.009
up out of the Red River so that we could, when we had to go out, if we did have to eject, we would be up over the mountains and hopefully a little safer than we knew in the valley.

08:40.230 --> 08:47.737
So we were able to climb and as we continued our climb, the aircraft started to come apart basically.

08:49.498 --> 08:58.026
Just before we had to eject, I remember the only control we had was with our rudders and I had both of my feet on the right rudder to keep the aircraft from rolling.

08:59.474 --> 09:07.431
And finally, the other aircraft that was now following underneath us finally called out and said, hey, you guys are burning bad.

09:07.451 --> 09:08.393
You've got to get out of it.

09:09.275 --> 09:13.084
So at 28,000 feet, we made the decision to eject.

09:13.545 --> 09:18.816
And at that point, if you can imagine the wildest...

09:19.083 --> 09:25.632
carnival ride you've ever been on in your life, and you multiply that by 10, that's exactly what the ejection was like.

09:26.453 --> 09:37.307
As I reached down and pulled up on the ejection handles, there is an actual cartridge in the seat that fires, and then a rocket lights, and you are sent on a really wild ride.

09:38.348 --> 09:47.841
Of course, at 28,000 feet, at 280 miles, or 280 knots indicated, we were actually making probably, you know,

09:48.108 --> 09:49.350
300 miles an hour.

09:50.172 --> 09:56.424
And as I hit the slipstream, my shield on my helmet shattered.

09:56.444 --> 10:05.842
And after I had an opportunity to understand what was happening, I thought I was bleeding to death, but I had just minor cuts all over my face.

10:06.464 --> 10:10.251
Luckily, I had my eyes closed, so I guess I was prepared for that.

10:11.716 --> 10:15.741
But here we are now in the ejection seat, and I'm falling.

10:15.761 --> 10:27.016
And in the F-4, you're in a Martin Baker seat, which you were actually strapped into the seat, and your parachute is actually encased into the ejection seat, and you stay in the seat as you fall.

10:27.076 --> 10:29.459
You don't come away from the seat.

10:31.021 --> 10:38.551
And now I have to fall from 28,000 feet down to where the parachute is supposed to open between 10,000 and 12,000 feet.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.153
But you're dealing with some mountains now.

10:40.538 --> 10:50.548
And as I'm falling, I'm looking around, and this is unbelievable, but some of the mountains are 12,000 feet tall right where I was going down.

10:50.568 --> 10:53.631
And I kept thinking to myself, I've got to do something.

10:53.651 --> 10:54.752
I've got to do something.

10:54.912 --> 10:55.913
I'm going to hit a mountain.

10:56.894 --> 11:03.961
And luckily, my brain caught up with me and reminded me that everything had worked properly so far.

11:03.981 --> 11:05.803
There was no reason to do anything stupid.

11:06.340 --> 11:17.739
And so I stayed right with the seat and just about that time, the next thing I knew, the lap seat, lap belt open, I was ejected out of the seat and I was hanging in the parachute.

11:18.179 --> 11:22.847
And that was very mild compared to the actual injection out of the aircraft.

11:22.827 --> 11:25.690
You're feeling better about that.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.152
Right now, I'm feeling pretty good.

11:27.212 --> 11:36.804
But as I go through all of the things that they train you and they beat these things into your mind so that you almost do them automatically, I get all prepared for the landing.

11:37.445 --> 11:45.194
But they forgot to tell us that where we're going to land is not going to be that nice, soft sand that we used for training.

11:45.214 --> 11:50.100
So as I'm looking down below me, I see just a jungle.

11:50.266 --> 12:12.207
totally green and the last and I as I came down the last thing that I remember as I was coming down in the parachute is a sound of a a ripping noise and I tried to look above me and I saw my parachute actually caught in a tree and then I sort of tumbled down and ended up on the ground.

12:13.638 --> 12:23.229
Only later did I realize that I had been unconscious for about 30 minutes as I probably had fallen through the trees at a lot greater impact than I thought initially.

12:24.030 --> 12:37.166
But as I hit the ground, in my mind, I immediately jumped up to my feet, I reached down, took out my survival radio and started talking to the aircraft that was still circling overhead.

12:37.186 --> 12:41.451
And his first comment was to me, where have you been?

12:42.342 --> 12:43.423
And I said, I've been right here.

12:43.443 --> 12:44.504
I said, I'm talking to you.

12:44.524 --> 12:47.347
He said, yeah, but it's been 30 minutes.

12:47.427 --> 12:48.208
I said, no, it hadn't.

12:48.228 --> 12:49.049
I just hit the ground.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.151
So we had a small conversation there.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.816
And he's trying to get me to relax and remember my training.

12:57.477 --> 13:04.945
And as we're talking, and he's talking to me on the radio, the first thing that comes to my mind and how things will affect you is I look over.

13:05.525 --> 13:09.169
Laying over beside me is a little one-man yellow life raft.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.130
It's about this long.

13:10.931 --> 13:12.012
And in my life,

13:12.498 --> 13:35.687
little panic there I thought oh my gosh somebody's going to see that the Viet Cong will see it they're going to come and get me so I take out a machete and I chop this thing up in little pieces and I cram it under this big log that I'm laying on and then I turn around and I look up and hanging above me is a great big orange and white parachute hanging in the trees

13:36.173 --> 13:42.060
And I thought to myself, now, you know, Lieutenant Milhoff, you've got to get control of yourself.

13:42.440 --> 13:47.826
And so I sat down and I took one of the baby bottles that I had in my flight suit.

13:47.846 --> 14:02.763
And we used these, I'm denying BX, so more baby bottles than any place else in the world, because we always carried baby bottles full of water so that we'd have a drink of water on some of these long missions.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.425
So I sat down and had a drink of water.

14:04.962 --> 14:19.173
and I started evaluating where I was and what I was doing and I finally looked around to see where I was and I was on a little clearing about as big as this set and I knew that I was fairly high on the mountain.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.983
Later on I learned that I was about 7,500 feet on the side of a mountain

14:24.082 --> 14:27.133
And I walked over and looked off the ledge.

14:27.193 --> 14:31.951
It was about 2,000 feet straight down and about 1,000 or so feet directly above me.

14:31.971 --> 14:32.533
So I had landed.

14:32.553 --> 14:33.878
So you weren't going on a hike of any kind.

14:33.898 --> 14:35.745
I was not going too far anywhere.

14:37.025 --> 14:49.871
The guys in the other aircraft, of course, relayed to me that the helicopters were leaving actually Thailand and were on their way to come and pick us up.

14:50.852 --> 14:57.666
And the relax saved my radio and that they would be there as quickly as they could get there.

14:57.646 --> 15:03.878
We actually went out about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so by now it's getting a little later.

15:04.359 --> 15:09.990
It's starting to get close to dark, and I hear the little Sandy aircraft.

15:10.050 --> 15:15.541
Now, the search aircraft that come in, there are four Sandys.

15:15.621 --> 15:16.944
They're A-1 aircraft.

15:16.964 --> 15:19.148
They're basically a World War II vintage.

15:19.448 --> 15:41.828
aircraft and uh they come in and actually protect they're the close air support for the helicopters and they have a little mini gun zone that can put you know a shell every square inch for a baseball size field so they are there to protect the helicopters and they actually arrive before the helicopters do so they were flying around above me and uh

15:42.230 --> 15:48.256
I could hear them, and I was talking to them, and they were telling me how to get prepared, and the helicopters would be there just shortly.

15:49.377 --> 15:55.483
And about 7.30 or so, the helicopters finally arrived in the area.

15:56.604 --> 16:01.929
They went over to, actually, I was on one side of the mountain, and Wally was on the other side of the mountain.

16:01.949 --> 16:05.492
They went over, and they found Wally first because he was out in the open.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.395
His parachute was laying out on a big open area.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.397
And they picked him up.

16:10.698 --> 16:33.178
and then they came over to the other side of the mountain where I was and while he's sitting in the door and I can see the helicopters up there and the helicopter comes and it gets right above me and I can watch it sitting there trying to hover and the tree penetrator is just within grasp almost and then the helicopter breaks off down the mountain.

16:34.137 --> 16:35.139
So you're back on the radio.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.001
I'm scared.

16:36.241 --> 16:39.328
You know, these guys are leaving, and they don't have me on that helicopter.

16:39.368 --> 16:43.557
So I grab my radio out and say, hey, guys, where are you going?

16:43.577 --> 16:45.200
And they come back and say, oh, no sweat.

16:45.661 --> 16:52.295
We're going to go down the mountain, and we're going to dump some fuel because we're too heavy to hover at this altitude.

16:52.736 --> 16:54.479
And so I say, okay, great, great.

16:54.519 --> 16:54.880
I'll wait.

16:56.328 --> 17:16.880
So I wait and about 10 minutes later, sure enough, here they come back and the helicopter flies up and it gets right above me and it's sitting there trying to hover the tree penetrator and I knew in my mind that if I could get one finger on that tree penetrator, I could go all the way back to South Vietnam hanging on one finger, but it just didn't quite get close enough.

17:18.202 --> 17:22.369
And the next thing I know, the helicopter is saying, and it goes back down the mountain.

17:23.885 --> 17:29.940
And I thought to myself, now, these guys are just going to dump more fuel and they'll be back in just a moment.

17:30.962 --> 17:35.995
And so I didn't get my radio out and I wait and five minutes pass and nothing.

17:36.877 --> 17:39.042
10 minutes pass and nothing.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.564
20 minutes pass and so now I'm starting to get worried because now it is dark.

17:44.584 --> 17:53.913
It's 8 o'clock at night and it's dark and I listen as all of the aircraft that had been flying overhead start to fly away and they all disappear.

17:53.974 --> 17:57.597
So I grab the radio out and not a soul will talk to me.

17:58.358 --> 17:58.938
Not a soul.

17:58.998 --> 18:07.847
Well, later I learned that that radio had gone bad or broken during this period of time and

18:08.047 --> 18:13.316
I wasn't able to hear any of the instructions or any of the things that any of the guys were telling me.

18:14.098 --> 18:20.570
And so here I was on a mountain by myself in North Vietnam, and it's dark, and I'm scared.

18:20.990 --> 18:28.885
But the Air Force has the same capability that so many organizations do.

18:28.945 --> 18:30.848
They pound certain things into your mind.

18:31.486 --> 18:37.575
And the one thing that they pounded into our brain is if we don't pick you up the first day, we'll be back at first light.

18:38.156 --> 18:38.937
First light.

18:38.957 --> 18:41.000
And so I pounded that into my mind.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.645
I remember they're coming after me at first light.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.289
So I want to fast forward here just a little bit.

18:48.371 --> 18:52.376
You know that they're coming after you because they've told you that that is what they will do.

18:52.396 --> 18:55.100
But meanwhile, you're spending the night on the side of that mountain.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.422
It starts to rain.

18:56.442 --> 18:57.143
It gets cold.

18:57.364 --> 18:59.046
The weather starts to deteriorate.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.651
But you make it through the night and you make it to first light.

19:01.711 --> 19:02.432
First light.

19:02.993 --> 19:07.800
When the sun comes up, it was actually a beautiful morning.

19:09.662 --> 19:16.852
It was hard to think about being in a war zone because the sun came out and for the first time it warmed up.

19:16.872 --> 19:17.874
I started to get warm.

19:17.934 --> 19:20.297
I'd been shivering all night long.

19:20.317 --> 19:23.542
And the birds were singing.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.164
There were flowers growing around.

19:25.184 --> 19:27.447
There weren't a lot of tall trees because I was getting

19:27.646 --> 19:28.407
I was pretty high.

19:28.487 --> 19:30.550
Most of it was just burns and moss and things.

19:31.571 --> 19:39.722
And so I stand there on the side of the mountain on this little clearing and start looking in the sky for the folks that are coming to get me.

19:39.742 --> 19:45.490
And this is 5 o'clock in the morning, and I'm looking down the mountain at the folks who might be coming after me.

19:46.311 --> 19:53.400
And, of course, you know, this gave me a capability to understand how your mind can really do tricks on you.

19:54.089 --> 19:59.014
I was standing there, and I would be looking down the mountain, and I would see, oh, there comes a man.

19:59.034 --> 19:59.735
Oh, there he is.

19:59.815 --> 20:04.800
I see him, and I would take my eyes off and look back, and it'd be a stump.

20:05.381 --> 20:13.970
And so I tried to calm myself to the effect that, hey, don't let this do anything crazy.

20:14.651 --> 20:21.598
And so I spent from 5 o'clock in the morning waiting for these guys who told me

20:21.933 --> 20:23.535
We'll be back at first light.

20:23.555 --> 20:32.908
But what they forgot to say is we're gonna leave Thailand at first light and we're in a helicopter making 90 miles an hour across Laos and all the way into North Vietnam.

20:32.988 --> 20:34.930
So it's gonna be a while before we get there.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.653
So it gets to be about nine o'clock when you finally hear something.

20:36.673 --> 20:42.861
So about nine o'clock in the morning, all of a sudden I hear an aircraft

20:43.111 --> 20:49.257
And just about the time I hear aircraft, I see the fog coming in up the valley.

20:49.277 --> 21:00.328
And within 30 minutes, the fog is so bad, the clouds and the moisture is so thick that I could hold my hand out in front of my face and I couldn't see it.

21:01.649 --> 21:09.777
And the Sandy aircraft, the propeller driven aircraft had come back in the area and they're flying up above me when luckily I reached down and I pulled out my

21:10.212 --> 21:28.035
other survival radio and luckily I had that because I had been assigned as a squadron survival officer and I had been trying to convince everyone to carry two radios and so I did it simply because I was telling everyone else to and luckily I had two radios because the other one was no good.

21:28.275 --> 21:29.336
Right.

21:29.356 --> 21:33.722
So I called and talked to the guys and they gave me a lot of instructions asked me why I hadn't

21:34.293 --> 21:36.677
gone down the mountain a couple of thousand feet.

21:36.757 --> 21:40.262
I told them, well, I didn't know I was supposed to because I didn't hear anybody.

21:40.282 --> 21:44.208
And they told me, said, well, the helicopters are on their way.

21:44.228 --> 21:48.835
Just stay right where you are and we'll attempt the rescue at this point.

21:48.955 --> 21:54.022
So they do, they finally, they do get there and the fog lifts for you.

21:54.042 --> 21:58.229
Well, that's part of the whole thing is here I am.

21:58.429 --> 22:03.777
It's the helicopters finally get into the area and I

22:04.027 --> 22:11.716
talked to the guys and they said, well, I called them up and said, there's no way, there's no way you guys are going to be able to get down in here.

22:11.877 --> 22:17.123
Don't even think about it because, you know, the weather was just so bad.

22:17.143 --> 22:18.625
The fog was so thick.

22:18.645 --> 22:26.895
And they said, well, the helicopters have about 10 minutes of hover time that they can stay in the area, wait to see what happens.

22:28.006 --> 22:34.202
And it was at this point that it finally, you know, and I don't want to say that it was anything dramatic.

22:34.262 --> 22:37.130
I didn't throw myself prostrate on the ground or anything.

22:37.190 --> 22:45.070
But it was at that point that I finally said to myself that, John, you've had all the training that you can get.

22:45.775 --> 22:49.258
You've done all the things that you're supposed to do.

22:49.278 --> 22:53.462
The Air Force has expended all this expense, the money, and the manpower.

22:54.863 --> 23:07.374
Everyone has done everything that they can do, but here you can't see your hand in front of your face, and you've basically left one important aspect out of this whole scenario.

23:08.555 --> 23:14.820
And like I say, it was just something that came into my mind, and I said to myself,

23:14.885 --> 23:19.470
Lord, I need your help.

23:19.490 --> 23:25.638
And it wasn't probably 30 seconds later that I felt a breeze across my face.

23:27.340 --> 23:32.105
The fog lifted and there was the helicopter directly above me.

23:33.006 --> 23:43.879
And they dropped the tree penetrator down and I opened it up, strapped it around me, climbed onto the helicopter and we exited the area.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.939
So now I'm a real happy camper.

23:46.959 --> 23:47.720
I'm excited.

23:48.101 --> 23:50.023
Man, things are going well for me.

23:51.766 --> 23:53.708
But the adventure's not quite over.

23:53.728 --> 23:55.511
The adventure's not quite over at that point.

23:56.732 --> 24:05.584
To try to calm me down, because they knew that I probably was pretty excited, which I really was, they sent me over by a window and gave me a headset.

24:05.744 --> 24:12.313
Now, we still had a hundred and so miles of North Vietnam and Laos to cross.

24:12.817 --> 24:21.471
and gave me a headset so I could listen to what's going on and told me to look out the window to make sure nobody was attacking us.

24:21.491 --> 24:28.323
And I noticed a fluid flowing down the side of the helicopter and I had the good sense to ask the guy, what is this?

24:28.403 --> 24:29.505
And he says, oh my gosh.

24:30.086 --> 24:39.381
And then the helicopter crew all got excited because it was the fluid out of the transmission that had a gasket that had broken.

24:40.255 --> 24:55.199
So the paramedic grabs me and puts me over by the door, puts a parachute on me, and says, now, if we have to jump out, said, I'm going to go with you, and I'll make sure your parachute opens before I open mine.

24:55.219 --> 24:57.743
And I told him, nope, I've already done that once.

24:57.883 --> 24:59.125
I don't need to do it again.

24:59.746 --> 25:01.910
Wherever the helicopter's going, that's where I'm going to go.

25:02.791 --> 25:07.579
So they immediately started calling, and they found out that the Lima Site 101,

25:07.981 --> 25:15.398
which is where the Montagnard tribesmen actually lived, was friendly that day or supposedly friendly.

25:15.418 --> 25:27.205
So we flew to the top of a mountain basically in northern Laos and landed on this little grassy knoll that's up on top of the mountain.

25:27.674 --> 25:39.714
And as we came into land, I noticed a couple of guys out on the hill there and found out later that they were the head tribesmen.

25:39.734 --> 25:49.851
And they had, after we landed, they insisted on meeting me because they disliked the north of me so much that they wanted to come.

25:50.202 --> 25:53.588
talk to me and simply say thank you.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.212
So you had a ceremony to attend.

25:56.232 --> 26:00.219
We had a little ceremony, and the entire village filed past.

26:00.239 --> 26:05.168
And then one of the guys told me, he said, well, it's normal to give them a gift.

26:05.208 --> 26:08.093
And the only thing I had was a $38,000

26:08.917 --> 26:13.344
that the Air Force gave me for a signaling device because I couldn't hit anything with it.

26:13.364 --> 26:22.999
And so I gave that to the chief of the village and it was very touching that they were appreciative of what we were trying to do.

26:23.279 --> 26:29.389
So you get on another helicopter and you get to relative safety and there's another ceremony.

26:29.369 --> 26:36.701
Well, this one was the funny one because they put me on the helicopter and flew me into Udarn, Thailand.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.684
And they were going to put me in the hospital there.

26:38.765 --> 26:42.371
And in route, of course, I had a medic with me.

26:42.391 --> 26:47.780
He told me that when we actually touched down, that there would be an ambulance there waiting on me.

26:47.800 --> 26:52.828
So when the helicopter touched down, I climbed out, still not knowing that I was hurt.

26:53.399 --> 26:55.622
and went over and climbed into the ambulance.

26:55.862 --> 27:03.452
And about the time I climbed in, a colonel comes running over and says, hey, are you the lieutenant at Mill Island that got shot down and rescued?

27:03.492 --> 27:04.113
I said, yes, sir.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.336
He said, well, you've got to come go through the ceremony.

27:06.857 --> 27:15.267
And so here I am now coming out of the ambulance with a hurt back, not knowing it, going over and have to go shake all the colonel's hands so they can say, welcome home.

27:15.287 --> 27:17.230
But it was quite fascinating.

27:17.412 --> 27:23.080
quite funny, the fact that it was more important to get the ceremonial than it was to get me over to the hospital.

27:24.242 --> 27:29.529
Need to fast forward here, but finally you get to the hospital and you find out that you do have injuries more serious than you thought that you had.

27:29.569 --> 27:31.332
You had broken bones in your back.

27:31.452 --> 27:32.153
Yes.

27:32.333 --> 27:38.882
When they finally got me to the hospital and were able to do x-rays, found out that I had three compression fractures in my back.

27:38.902 --> 27:46.373
So I spent about the next 30 days tied to a bed until they made sure that none of them were going to be

27:46.775 --> 27:47.956
lasting injuries.

27:48.377 --> 27:57.207
And then finally, after I'd been at Udarn for about a week, they sent me to Japan, and I was able to communicate with my family finally.

27:57.768 --> 28:13.407
And probably one of the things that we need to remember that this was probably harder on my family, my mother, father, my wife's family, and especially my wife, because she had to face those two blue uniforms that knocked on the door.

28:14.248 --> 28:14.588
Yeah.

28:16.154 --> 28:23.165
John Milhollan, Lieutenant John Milhollan, it's a tough story to tell, but it's a very proud story to tell, and we thank you very, very much for your service.

28:23.185 --> 28:29.434
Well, I thank you, and I have to say I appreciate my wife for being with me for all these many years.

28:30.115 --> 28:31.197
Thank you for having me.

28:31.217 --> 28:31.858
You bet.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.702
Lieutenant John Milhollan, Vietnam War.

28:35.584 --> 28:38.528
Thank you, John Milhollan, and please thank a veteran today.

28:38.689 --> 28:42.675
Next week, Glenn Morgan, bugler on the USS Indianapolis.

28:42.815 --> 28:44.237
It's quite a compelling story.

28:44.538 --> 28:46.841
For John Milhollan, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:47.182 --> 28:48.275
Thank you for watching Veterans of the Valley.

28:49.000 --> 29:00.000
[Silence.]

29:00.000 --> 29:10.000
[Music.]

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
