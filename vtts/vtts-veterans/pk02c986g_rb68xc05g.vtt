00:36.021 --> 00:43.021
[Music.]

00:43.350 --> 00:48.344
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:48.364 --> 00:49.346
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:50.207 --> 01:05.003
The path that Lawrence DeZavala took from his birthplace in Louisiana to his vineyards near New Baden included three years of service as a radio operator gunner, flying some 21 combat missions with the Air Force's 379th bomber group.

01:05.489 --> 01:13.303
Their mission aboard their B-24 was to take out rail yards and bridges in Austria and other positions near the war's end.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.028
He counts himself lucky to have returned uninjured.

01:16.049 --> 01:19.675
Counts himself even more fortunate to have lived the life he's lived.

01:19.695 --> 01:23.903
He and Rachel, his wife of 62 years, own and operate DeZavala Vineyards,

01:23.984 --> 01:27.268
where some of the tastiest blackberries, blueberries, raspberries can be picked.

01:27.628 --> 01:30.191
We welcome Lawrence DeZavala to Veterans of the Valley.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.754
Thank you for your service and thank you for being here, Lawrence.

01:32.774 --> 01:33.715
I want to go back.

01:33.735 --> 01:35.537
You were born in Gretna, Louisiana.

01:35.597 --> 01:39.302
You soon came to Texas with your family.

01:39.322 --> 01:40.343
Sort of take us from there.

01:40.363 --> 01:41.224
You came to Houston.

01:41.244 --> 01:43.106
Your dad eventually went to work for Dow.

01:43.126 --> 01:48.032
Sort of take us from there in your youth, going to high school in Freeport and eventually getting into the service.

01:48.052 --> 01:49.213
Sort of take us to that time.

01:49.774 --> 01:51.055
All right.

01:51.440 --> 01:59.474
went to Freeport High School and I graduated in 1942 after the war had started in December 7th, of course.

02:00.296 --> 02:03.862
And then my intention was to go to college.

02:05.024 --> 02:08.250
Also, I was going to be drafted and so

02:08.905 --> 02:18.597
Instead of joining up when I was 17 years old, my father suggested that, and I've got a boy so I can understand his feelings.

02:19.298 --> 02:24.525
I decided to work on construction for a year or so until just before I turned 18.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.868
Then I went and volunteered for the Air Force.

02:26.948 --> 02:27.549
Yes, sir.

02:27.569 --> 02:31.093
I didn't think I wanted to be in the infantry and do all that walking.

02:31.253 --> 02:31.514
Right.

02:31.914 --> 02:33.036
I joined the Air Force.

02:33.736 --> 02:38.102
They told me I wanted to get into navigation and be a navigator.

02:39.027 --> 02:45.339
They told me that they weren't calling them up very fast and just go back home and enjoy life.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.688
Well, I went back home, and three weeks later, they called me up.

02:49.708 --> 02:54.717
I trained and took my basic at Wichita Falls, Shepherd Field.

02:55.579 --> 03:01.170
And then during that time, they give you all kinds of physicals, and I failed one of my physicals.

03:01.488 --> 03:05.073
So I couldn't be a navigator, but I could be a gunner.

03:05.974 --> 03:09.819
So they said I had an aptitude for code and radio.

03:09.899 --> 03:14.045
So I went to radio school in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

03:14.065 --> 03:14.345
Right.

03:14.486 --> 03:20.053
And that was in the winter of 1944, January of 44.

03:20.708 --> 03:34.541
I never will forget, I'd never been too far out of Texas, and we stopped for, I was layover in Omaha, Nebraska in the wintertime, and there was cold smoke everywhere, and when you blew your nose, it was black.

03:34.561 --> 03:38.445
And I just, old Southern boy just didn't understand that.

03:38.465 --> 03:39.506
It was a little too cold for you.

03:39.526 --> 03:49.635
A little too cold, but I stayed in Sioux Falls for six months, graduated from radio school, and then in the hot summer, I went to Yuma, Arizona for gunnery.

03:49.615 --> 03:50.216
Right.

03:50.236 --> 03:52.459
And that was 110 to 120.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.321
Just the opposite.

03:53.341 --> 03:54.522
And so just the opposite.

03:54.542 --> 03:54.843
Right.

03:55.183 --> 03:59.029
But Sioux Falls, South Dakota was gorgeous and beautiful in the spring.

03:59.049 --> 04:01.253
We really enjoyed it during that period of time.

04:01.453 --> 04:02.134
Right.

04:02.154 --> 04:05.078
You eventually went to California.

04:05.098 --> 04:05.599
Yes.

04:05.619 --> 04:14.793
And you thought at the time, because you had taken a train up to Hamilton Field in San Francisco, you were pretty sure you were going to be stationed in the Pacific, but they kind of pulled a switch on you, right?

04:14.813 --> 04:16.095
They sure did.

04:16.075 --> 04:22.462
We made crews up in California and then went for operational training.

04:22.482 --> 04:25.946
That's where you train as a crew for 90 days.

04:26.086 --> 04:32.774
It's one day on the ground training and one day in the air training until you finish operational training.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.497
And that's when they sent us to San Francisco.

04:35.577 --> 04:37.379
And man, we're going to the Pacific.

04:37.399 --> 04:38.641
And we got to Frisco.

04:38.681 --> 04:39.602
They gave us all

04:40.426 --> 04:46.519
heavy wool clothing and put us on a train and shipped us to Newport News, Virginia eight days later.

04:46.539 --> 04:47.742
And you knew something was up, right?

04:47.762 --> 04:49.525
That was quite a trip, I'll tell you.

04:50.147 --> 04:54.115
Then they put us aboard the SS West Point.

04:54.263 --> 04:57.186
And we went alone across the Atlantic.

04:57.426 --> 04:57.666
Right.

04:58.307 --> 05:02.992
Only took us, I think, about six days going.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.253
We landed in Naples.

05:04.953 --> 05:12.321
And in Naples, then, we were assigned as replacement crews for those that had been lost in the 15th Air Force.

05:12.481 --> 05:12.761
Right.

05:13.101 --> 05:16.505
I was assigned to the 379th Bomb Group.

05:17.306 --> 05:19.748
And from there, we flew...

05:20.977 --> 05:27.466
21 missions into Austria, into Germany, into Yugoslavia.

05:28.187 --> 05:33.413
We were stationed in the heel of the boot west of Brindisi.

05:33.433 --> 05:46.310
We'd take off and get in formation and go up the middle of the Adriatic until we got at some predetermined point where the navigator says turn, and then we turned inland to go to our target.

05:46.511 --> 05:46.731
Right.

05:47.048 --> 05:49.134
Talk more about your mission.

05:49.154 --> 05:57.098
I referred to it a little bit, but your mission was mainly to cut off their supplies, to cut off their ability to travel by taking out bridges and taking out rail yards.

05:57.118 --> 05:57.780
Yes.

05:58.321 --> 06:00.889
You can imagine a...

06:02.557 --> 06:05.061
Linz, Austria was a large town.

06:05.722 --> 06:11.471
Vienna, Austria was a tremendous town with rail yards all around the place.

06:11.592 --> 06:15.498
And so there were lots of targets and Vienna was a tough target.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.102
You flew there.

06:18.638 --> 06:25.766
We never did get jumped by fighters, but we withstood flak on almost every trip.

06:25.926 --> 06:32.573
We considered ourselves, if we didn't hear or see flak, we considered ourselves very lucky.

06:32.954 --> 06:36.157
Now, people who don't know flak, those come from ground guns.

06:36.177 --> 06:42.444
That was an anti-aircraft gun on the ground set to explode at a certain elevation in the sky.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.789
And in order to confuse the Germans on that elevation,

06:46.769 --> 07:03.364
One of my jobs was to drop this, what they call chaff, out of a hole in the side of the airplane, and it was nothing more than strips of tinfoil, which reflected their radar and gave them false senses of elevation.

07:03.384 --> 07:03.724
I see.

07:03.844 --> 07:09.590
So they'd zero in on that and then hopefully miss us, which they did on that kind of a basis.

07:09.610 --> 07:13.733
So these would be like strips of tinfoil that you would just put out about every minute?

07:13.793 --> 07:16.776
In a little box, and we'd throw them out every minute.

07:16.756 --> 07:19.380
If the flak was heavy, we'd throw them out a little faster.

07:19.681 --> 07:22.625
And the idea is that would mess up their radar.

07:22.725 --> 07:25.810
Yes, and give them a false reading on their elevation.

07:25.830 --> 07:26.351
Of where you were.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.434
Of where they could aim to.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.698
Right, so the flak would explode where you weren't.

07:30.718 --> 07:30.978
That's right.

07:30.998 --> 07:31.740
That was the idea.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.561
That is correct.

07:32.581 --> 07:34.925
But sometimes you got hit by some flak.

07:34.945 --> 07:37.128
Yes, we got hit by flak.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.931
It rattled around the inside of your plane.

07:38.951 --> 07:42.156
If you saw the black smoke through the flak,

07:42.136 --> 07:54.269
You didn't worry, but if you saw the red fire or the explosion, then you were pretty close to it, and sometimes the shrapnel would come through both sides of the airplane, and you'd hear it going through both sides.

07:54.389 --> 07:54.650
Right.

07:55.190 --> 08:10.827
And so sometimes we'd get a little afeared, and we wore flax suits, which were nothing more than steel pieces mounted in a vest that you put over your head and protected your upper part of your body.

08:11.431 --> 08:15.781
And there was a flak suit in the back, and we'd put those on.

08:15.801 --> 08:27.870
And once you rallied, after the bombs were dropped, one of my jobs was to let the ball turret gunner down into his ball for fighter protection.

08:28.559 --> 08:34.088
We were, as I say, I think very fortunate we didn't ever get jumped by fighters.

08:34.148 --> 08:40.998
We were protected with fighters by the Tuskegee black pilots and they were terrific.

08:41.159 --> 08:48.390
Wanted to talk about that because that's fascinating, especially to me because I've read the books and seen the movie about the Tuskegee Airmen.

08:48.370 --> 09:15.829
and and what they did and they were they were protection uh for for b24s like like yourself. They were extreme protection. We love to see them. They had uh black and white checkered tails if I remember correctly and we always were very happy when we saw them at a distance and they generally stay above us four to five thousand feet waiting for something to jump us in case it did. Right. The uh fighters left us when we went

09:16.467 --> 09:21.775
on the bomb run because you had to fly straight and narrow, and that's when the flak was the worst.

09:21.795 --> 09:28.226
So they'd leave us, and then they'd pick us up after we finished the bomb run on the rally and escort us back.

09:28.646 --> 09:35.237
They were flying out of northern Italy, and we were flying out of southern Italy in the heel of the boot.

09:36.318 --> 09:39.764
So you didn't really get a chance to meet them, but you knew them by what they did.

09:39.824 --> 09:40.225
That's right.

09:40.265 --> 09:41.587
We knew them by what they did.

09:41.767 --> 09:42.348
Exactly.

09:42.368 --> 09:44.331
And so we were proud of them.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.303
Your position on the B-24 was in the waist of the airplane.

09:47.564 --> 09:49.586
Yes, I was in the open waist window.

09:49.766 --> 09:50.007
Right.

09:50.227 --> 09:54.212
Some of them had plexiglass coverings there, but most of them are open.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.456
We had twin .50 caliber machine guns.

09:58.016 --> 10:02.141
Both of them were electric heated by the system of the airplane.

10:02.822 --> 10:10.711
Heaters on top at 20 to 25 below zero, that oil gets pretty heavy and you don't want it messing up.

10:10.731 --> 10:10.992
Right.

10:11.332 --> 10:13.795
Your job was once you got clear,

10:14.737 --> 10:19.042
was to test fire your guns to be sure they were operable.

10:19.543 --> 10:33.279
Pilot would tell you when, and so you'd just fire a short burst just to be sure they're operable, and then leave it that way until you rallied back and were flying back home, then you took the shells out.

10:33.479 --> 10:34.000
Right.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.664
Most of your early missions you flew at, what, 20,000 feet or so?

10:37.824 --> 10:38.665
15 to 20,000 feet?

10:38.685 --> 10:40.868
No, most of them were at 20 to 22.

10:40.888 --> 10:41.749
22,000 feet.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.592
But you talked about near war's end.

10:44.572 --> 10:47.359
You'd get down to missions where you were flying at 10 and 12,000 feet.

10:47.439 --> 10:55.919
We were fine at ground protection or ground harassment of the enemy as the Germans were retreating in northern Italy.

10:55.939 --> 11:02.074
Our job was to drop what they call proximity bombs, which exploded about 50 foot off the ground.

11:02.678 --> 11:05.142
and for devastating for ground troops.

11:05.903 --> 11:08.987
And so we didn't fly but about 10 to 12,000 feet.

11:09.067 --> 11:14.215
And so that made our job tougher because we were much closer to their anti-aircraft.

11:14.315 --> 11:14.575
Right.

11:14.596 --> 11:17.520
And you were in more harm's way of flying that low.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.005
And your thought was, I'm going to be going home here before long.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.809
You didn't want this thing to end badly towards the end of the war.

11:23.958 --> 11:28.687
Normally, when we first got over there, we would have flown every day if given the opportunity.

11:28.827 --> 11:33.275
But they had so many pilots, so many crews, and a few airplanes.

11:33.355 --> 11:36.922
Of course, they'd have to repair the airplanes, but they had lots of crews.

11:37.002 --> 11:39.587
So we flew about every three days.

11:40.090 --> 12:04.275
and then toward the end of the war we could see it ending and then it kind of got frustrating with we got a little bit of fear into us and saying what if we get shot down then the day before the war is over. That's pretty horrendous. Right so we weren't quite that eager toward the end, but it was over and we were very thankful our pilot and co-pilot decided to

12:04.778 --> 12:10.990
Oh, within two weeks after the war was over that he got an opportunity to fly a brand new airplane back to the States.

12:11.210 --> 12:11.812
Right.

12:11.832 --> 12:18.384
So he asked all of us if we'd like to stay with him or we could stay over there and take a ship back.

12:18.464 --> 12:19.567
And we said, no way.

12:19.627 --> 12:20.148
Let's go.

12:20.208 --> 12:20.929
Let's fly home.

12:21.049 --> 12:23.935
So we flew home, flew to Africa.

12:24.472 --> 12:30.823
Flew to the Azores, flew to Newfoundland, and then into Connecticut where we landed.

12:30.843 --> 12:38.937
And from there, I was sent to Fort Sam Houston for a 30-day furlough.

12:39.389 --> 12:42.432
And my girlfriend and I decided to get married.

12:42.472 --> 12:43.894
Yes.

12:43.914 --> 12:44.475
So we got married.

12:44.495 --> 12:46.477
You'd already given her an engagement ring before you went over.

12:46.497 --> 12:48.679
I'd given her an engagement ring the Christmas before.

12:48.840 --> 12:49.100
Right.

12:49.540 --> 12:51.423
And so we were engaged.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.286
And so we decided to get married.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.750
And it was a little difficult for me.

12:58.571 --> 13:00.052
I was Catholic and she was not.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.816
In those days, Catholic couldn't get married in a Protestant church.

13:03.877 --> 13:06.560
And the Protestants couldn't get married in the Catholic church.

13:06.860 --> 13:07.000
Mm-hmm.

13:07.300 --> 13:11.601
So we told a good padre to come to her mother's backyard.

13:11.681 --> 13:14.254
And she had lots of flowers and everything.

13:14.314 --> 13:16.163
And so we...

13:16.447 --> 13:18.008
We got married in our backyard.

13:18.048 --> 13:25.576
The other problem was to find the best man that was a Catholic, but a good friend of mine was home on furlough also.

13:25.636 --> 13:28.799
He'd been in the Air Force, so he stood in for me.

13:29.519 --> 13:37.727
And 62 years later, you and Rachel are living here in the Brazos Valley and operating, like we said, your vineyard.

13:38.147 --> 13:44.293
And we're going to see some pictures, a couple that you have and a couple that I took the other day when I was out at your place.

13:44.273 --> 13:46.315
of parts of your vineyard too.

13:46.335 --> 13:48.858
And we're gonna be talking a lot about that in the second half of the show.

13:48.878 --> 13:56.488
Let's go ahead and go to just a few pictures that we have here that Mr. DeZavala has given us.

13:56.508 --> 13:56.928
There we go.

13:57.809 --> 13:59.351
You're about 19 years old in this picture.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.053
I was 19 years old.

14:01.073 --> 14:05.558
So you were young and just, this was I guess before you went overseas, right?

14:05.598 --> 14:06.079
Yes.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.198
Good-looking airman right there.

14:09.498 --> 14:10.099
Thank you.

14:10.119 --> 14:10.560
You bet.

14:12.863 --> 14:15.346
Now, here's a B-24 that I came up with.

14:15.366 --> 14:17.169
This is the Liberator.

14:17.309 --> 14:18.811
The waist gunner, I guess, was what?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.093
You can't really see it in this picture.

14:20.113 --> 14:22.096
About where that star is on the side.

14:22.136 --> 14:22.977
That's where the waist gunner is.

14:22.997 --> 14:23.638
Right behind the wing.

14:23.898 --> 14:25.901
Right behind the wing.

14:25.921 --> 14:27.443
Of course, the nose gunner was up front.

14:27.777 --> 14:32.502
Yeah, tail gunner was in the rear, then they had an upper turret gunner, which is above the 9-1.

14:33.102 --> 14:35.064
You can see there, that's an upper turret.

14:35.425 --> 14:36.086
Right.

14:36.106 --> 14:39.609
There were six enlisted men and four officers on every plane.

14:39.889 --> 14:40.130
Right.

14:41.972 --> 14:43.693
Quite an aircraft, quite a steady aircraft.

14:43.713 --> 14:44.334
Yes.

14:44.354 --> 14:52.182
This was taken a couple of years ago in celebration of your 60th wedding anniversary taken out at your farm, and that's you and your beautiful wife, Rachel.

14:52.735 --> 15:00.883
I really don't know why I couldn't maintain my svelte look when I was 19.

15:00.943 --> 15:01.744
I ballooned.

15:05.248 --> 15:10.233
I got a couple of pictures here that I was able to take the other day.

15:11.173 --> 15:20.683
This is the sign right there on Highway 79, headed out beyond New Baden, beyond Franklin.

15:21.001 --> 15:21.882
And that's the sign.

15:21.902 --> 15:25.006
And in the background, you can see part of the vineyards that you grew on the highway.

15:25.046 --> 15:27.068
We're going to talk about your vineyards here coming up.

15:27.168 --> 15:27.689
All right.

15:29.231 --> 15:29.891
You can see that.

15:29.911 --> 15:34.337
And then I've got another shot of some of the vineyards there that's on the highway.

15:34.357 --> 15:36.920
And that's just a part of what you all have.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.242
Yeah, that's about an acre on the highway.

15:39.282 --> 15:42.106
We've got about another four acres there up by the house.

15:42.286 --> 15:43.347
Right, right.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.111
And it's a beautiful place.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.915
I've been out there, and it's great.

15:46.956 --> 15:48.639
I want to talk now about after the war.

15:48.679 --> 15:51.927
You came home June of 1945, and you did get married.

15:51.947 --> 15:53.871
I guess you got married in San Antonio.

15:53.951 --> 15:54.272
Is that right?

15:54.292 --> 15:54.513
No, no.

15:54.553 --> 15:55.796
I got married in Freeport.

15:55.916 --> 15:56.497
In Freeport.

15:56.517 --> 15:57.139
Okay.

15:57.259 --> 15:57.920
In Freeport.

15:58.041 --> 15:58.422
Okay.

15:58.442 --> 15:59.985
But you went honeymooning in Kerrville.

16:00.303 --> 16:07.115
Went honeymooning in Kerrville, and when we got to the Heart of the Hills Inn in Kerrville, there were six other honeymoon couples there.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.000
And we knew one of the couples.

16:10.541 --> 16:13.286
So it was after the war, so getting married was quite a popular thing.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.229
Well, the war was still on in the Pacific.

16:15.350 --> 16:15.630
Right.

16:16.131 --> 16:24.606
And then from after the end of my furlough, I went to California to be reassigned, and I had enough combat hours to

16:24.991 --> 16:29.019
That eliminated me from at the present time of going to be trained in 29.

16:29.320 --> 16:29.520
Right.

16:30.221 --> 16:36.494
So I was sent back as permanent party to Victoria, Foster Field in Victoria, Texas.

16:36.514 --> 16:37.536
That's a fighter base, right?

16:37.556 --> 16:38.638
That's a fighter base.

16:38.658 --> 16:43.488
And my job then was I worked evenings, checked out all the radios and the fighters.

16:43.688 --> 16:44.029
Right.

16:44.209 --> 16:47.095
Every night because they were still training fighter pilots there.

16:47.115 --> 16:47.235
Right.

16:47.215 --> 16:56.562
And you had 90 points because you got five points for each of the combat missions that you had flown while you were in Italy, so you were able to get out in October of 1945.

16:56.802 --> 16:57.745
You were discharged.

16:57.765 --> 17:02.659
Yes, I was discharged in October, and I wanted to be a...

17:02.639 --> 17:06.824
A metallurgical engineer, and there were two schools in Texas that offered it.

17:07.504 --> 17:12.190
One was A&M, and the other was University of Texas at El Paso.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.392
I guess it was called Texas Western back then, is that right?

17:14.412 --> 17:15.273
It was called, yes.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.797
No, no, it was called College of Mines and Metallurgy.

17:18.817 --> 17:20.098
That's right, that's right.

17:20.118 --> 17:21.400
Texas Western came later.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.681
I wasn't going back far enough.

17:22.701 --> 17:25.204
Texas Western came later, that's right.

17:25.184 --> 17:28.649
I had had enough of the service.

17:28.669 --> 17:40.726
I did not want to come to A&M because I understood that I did not have to join the Corps, but I felt that if you're going to be an Aggie, you need to be in the Corps because that is the spirit of A&M.

17:40.906 --> 17:41.166
Right.

17:41.507 --> 17:43.550
And so we decided to go to El Paso.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.531
Didn't know a soul.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.133
Drove out there.

17:46.594 --> 17:48.036
My wife got a job.

17:48.252 --> 17:53.078
We got an apartment, and I went to school there four and a half years.

17:53.098 --> 17:53.519
Right.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.961
And you got out, and you were looking for a job.

17:54.981 --> 17:56.964
You had a little trouble getting a job initially.

17:57.104 --> 17:57.464
Oh, yeah.

17:57.484 --> 17:59.707
In 1949, things were pretty tough.

18:00.148 --> 18:00.669
Right.

18:00.689 --> 18:06.376
In fact, you'd been offered a job in Utah, and they gave it to somebody else and kind of slipped the rug out from under you.

18:06.396 --> 18:08.259
But you eventually got a job in El Paso.

18:08.279 --> 18:13.045
It was there just for about four months when you got to go home to Freeport and work for Dow.

18:13.025 --> 18:18.237
I got an offer from Dow in December of 1949.

18:19.420 --> 18:22.768
And so we went back home basically to Dow.

18:22.828 --> 18:24.071
Haven't regretted it a bit.

18:24.211 --> 18:25.935
I've enjoyed every minute of it.

18:25.955 --> 18:27.659
You worked for Dow for 34 and a half years.

18:27.679 --> 18:29.042
34 and a half years.

18:29.022 --> 18:30.925
And a great career there.

18:30.945 --> 18:38.136
And you told me that over those years, besides the salary that you made, they also offered you stock in Dow, and you took it every chance you got.

18:38.256 --> 18:43.363
Well, they offered stock at a reduced rate, and you could pay it off on a 10-month installment.

18:43.484 --> 18:44.165
Right, right.

18:44.225 --> 18:46.268
And because of that, you were able to buy your farm.

18:46.408 --> 18:48.992
I buy my farm up there, 315 acres.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.115
We bought that with...

18:51.432 --> 18:56.546
paid the down payment, which got it down where we can handle it with the Dow stock.

18:56.626 --> 18:58.231
I still have some Dow stock left.

18:58.411 --> 18:59.755
Well, that's good.

18:59.976 --> 19:01.560
Hold on to it.

19:01.793 --> 19:08.722
And that's what I want to go to now because I was able to come out to your farm the other day where you and Rachel, you invite folks out to come out.

19:08.742 --> 19:11.285
And it's a working business that you all have.

19:11.325 --> 19:13.247
And it's been a business for quite some time.

19:13.267 --> 19:17.152
As a matter of fact, you developed the farm and the vineyard before you ever moved there in 1990.

19:17.653 --> 19:18.053
Oh, yes.

19:18.254 --> 19:18.374
Right.

19:18.394 --> 19:18.634
Yes.

19:19.035 --> 19:29.167
I fought the deer when we'd plant the deer and the cuttings and they'd sprout and we'd leave and be gone for two weeks and come back and there'd be nothing on there, nothing green.

19:29.468 --> 19:29.688
Right.

19:29.788 --> 19:31.210
The deer would move in and

19:31.544 --> 19:32.686
And eat everything.

19:32.846 --> 19:34.408
Right, because you lived in Freeport at the time.

19:34.428 --> 19:37.472
You were still working, but you spent your vacation and your weekends.

19:37.613 --> 19:37.993
Oh, yeah.

19:38.214 --> 19:42.039
You'd make the drive over to this area to work the farm.

19:42.379 --> 19:47.226
We put a compass on the map from Freeport, and we wanted no more than 200 miles.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.212
And it was 190 miles from my house to the farm.

19:52.173 --> 19:53.415
And you knew that route pretty well.

19:53.435 --> 19:55.358
We could do that in four hours.

19:55.675 --> 20:03.386
Very conveniently, we'd go up Friday evening and stay Saturday and end of Sunday and come home Sunday evening.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.812
We started to talk the other day and we never finished the conversation.

20:06.832 --> 20:07.593
I want you to do it now.

20:07.613 --> 20:10.076
We're talking about your home that you live in.

20:10.096 --> 20:17.147
And it had originally been a barracks that was connected to the prison camp that was connected to Hearn.

20:17.167 --> 20:17.648
Is that right?

20:17.668 --> 20:17.748
Yes.

20:18.028 --> 20:18.950
Talk about that.

20:19.210 --> 20:23.877
The original old building there, the people that owned the property,

20:24.380 --> 20:33.051
They had bought one of the old barracks from the German prisoner of war camp in Hearn and installed it there on the property.

20:34.633 --> 20:40.460
It still had the sliding barracks windows like I had in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

20:40.480 --> 20:45.967
And then they had added on to it, but in the same configuration.

20:45.987 --> 20:49.712
It was about 55 foot long and 15 foot wide.

20:49.861 --> 20:54.589
And so it had no internal wiring.

20:54.649 --> 20:56.372
It had no internal plumbing.

20:57.153 --> 21:02.061
It had no gas or anything there.

21:03.904 --> 21:07.811
Ben worked in the maintenance department at Dow.

21:08.472 --> 21:15.143
I'd go down and talk to the electrician expert and ask him what to do, and he'd tell me, and I'd go up over the weekend and

21:15.595 --> 21:16.656
So I wired it.

21:17.197 --> 21:25.728
I'd go underneath and drill through the plates and bring the wire in underneath and bring it to a plug and then go up and put the ceiling lights in.

21:26.309 --> 21:29.473
It had no internal walls at all.

21:29.493 --> 21:30.414
It had no windows.

21:30.514 --> 21:33.898
It had openings, but it had plastic nailed over there.

21:34.019 --> 21:42.970
My father, when he first saw that, he told my mother, he says, my God, what have those kids got into with something like that?

21:42.950 --> 21:45.714
That just really threw him for a loop.

21:46.235 --> 21:47.797
And you made a beautiful home out there.

21:47.817 --> 21:50.861
Yeah, it had no water and everything.

21:51.402 --> 21:55.267
We made a deal on the highway with a filling station.

21:55.667 --> 22:02.997
He had a good well, and we asked him if we could fill up 10-gallon water cans, and that's what we drank out of and cooked out of.

22:03.678 --> 22:12.130
Then I put a guttering system on the tin roof and collected the gutters into a 1,600-gallon cistern

22:12.110 --> 22:15.915
connected my pump into that, and then I plumbed the house completely.

22:16.937 --> 22:19.380
I had running water, had pressure system.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.481
We didn't drink the water.

22:21.002 --> 22:25.909
We drank wine, we drank beer, and we drank the water that we could borrow from the guy on the highway.

22:26.530 --> 22:27.811
You started the vineyard in 1979.

22:27.831 --> 22:38.926
1979, we planted about five acres, and we were all aglow with what we thought we could do.

22:39.026 --> 22:39.467
We had

22:39.802 --> 22:46.590
attended a wine grape seminar at A&M, and they were growing grapes all over West Texas.

22:47.391 --> 22:57.543
And so the first recommendation by Dr. George Ray McEachern, who's still with A&M, the grape specialist, his recommendation was muscadines.

22:57.563 --> 22:58.865
That's the only thing it'll grow.

22:59.626 --> 23:01.388
Well, my mother-in-law gave me some

23:01.705 --> 23:05.951
French-American hybrids and some muscadines, and that started us.

23:05.971 --> 23:11.278
And then the next year, they decided there were a few grapevines that would grow here.

23:12.019 --> 23:16.285
And so we started growing them and lost a lot of them because of Pierce's disease.

23:17.207 --> 23:20.651
But then I found and stumbled into blueberries.

23:21.372 --> 23:24.777
Tried peaches also, but they were difficult.

23:24.757 --> 23:26.979
Lots of work, lots of work.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.304
That's all there is on the farm is work, I'm finding out.

23:31.324 --> 23:32.965
And see, I was raised in the city.

23:33.125 --> 23:36.349
I've never been on a farm in my life.

23:36.369 --> 23:44.777
As a matter of fact, you told me that when you started it, you thought about going into the winery business, but being in a dry county, it'd been tough to sell it.

23:44.797 --> 23:45.658
Well, I couldn't sell it.

23:45.818 --> 23:47.060
I'd have had to move it someplace.

23:47.080 --> 23:47.680
It'd been illegal to sell it.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.641
Yeah, illegal to sell it.

23:48.681 --> 23:50.443
I get lots of folks that come up and

23:50.423 --> 23:52.365
I want to buy some of my homemade wine.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.027
And I said, no, no, no.

23:54.388 --> 23:56.711
Oh, you just set one there and I'll leave some.

23:56.731 --> 23:57.772
I said, no, forget it.

23:58.052 --> 23:58.673
You can't do that.

23:58.833 --> 24:00.355
I can't do that.

24:00.375 --> 24:04.180
Because by law, I think you're able to make, what, 200 gallons a year?

24:04.240 --> 24:07.063
I'm allowed to make 200 gallons a year as head of household.

24:07.263 --> 24:07.524
Right.

24:07.904 --> 24:14.011
The laws in Texas have changed quite a bit now since the winery groups have been really working on the legislature.

24:14.232 --> 24:14.592
Uh-huh.

24:14.572 --> 24:19.358
You can now sell wine if you're in a dry precinct.

24:19.458 --> 24:19.878
Right.

24:19.898 --> 24:22.922
You set up, you get a special permit for that one area.

24:23.162 --> 24:23.543
Right.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.185
And so it works out pretty well.

24:25.365 --> 24:34.696
And now when I first got into the Texas Wine and Grape Growers Association, it was, I think, four or five wineries.

24:34.756 --> 24:36.458
Now there's about 100 in Texas.

24:36.578 --> 24:36.919
Yes, sir.

24:37.079 --> 24:37.980
So it's really grown.

24:38.264 --> 24:39.487
We've got just a couple of minutes left.

24:39.527 --> 24:41.893
I'm gonna let you go ahead and throw in a quick commercial here.

24:41.994 --> 24:52.220
You all invite people to come out and pick their own berries or you'll pick them for them for a little bit more cost, but sort of talk about what people and families are able to do out there.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.045
Okay, we have blueberries,

24:54.346 --> 24:57.452
Blackberries, raspberries, and grapes.

24:58.133 --> 25:05.307
And then if I'm lucky in a year and have a decent garden, we'll sell tomatoes and other vegetables as folks come there.

25:05.908 --> 25:07.652
We encourage folks to come pick.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.694
They're easy to pick.

25:08.734 --> 25:10.658
Blueberries have no thorns.

25:10.678 --> 25:11.820
They have no spray.

25:12.722 --> 25:16.489
We tell all the kids that come picking, hey, if you don't eat a few there,

25:16.638 --> 25:17.960
You're not a good picker.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.402
And boy, they smile.

25:19.422 --> 25:23.008
And so we encourage that.

25:23.028 --> 25:27.495
We have both the thornless and the thorn type blackberries.

25:27.515 --> 25:30.380
And of course, raspberries have thorns, but they're not as bad.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.662
We have them trellised up.

25:32.242 --> 25:33.845
We have picnic facilities.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.469
We've got a gazebo and a little lake.

25:36.449 --> 25:40.773
If you want to come fishing, we'll let you come fishing, but you've got to turn all the fish loose.

25:40.913 --> 25:42.255
You've got to turn that.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.376
Can't take any with you.

25:43.536 --> 25:44.437
And it's easy to get to.

25:44.477 --> 25:54.606
I can tell you, folks, you go 79 north through Franklin and New Baden, past the Sanderson Farm feed facility out there, and you're just past that Sanderson Farm.

25:54.646 --> 25:56.168
Turn right, there's a big sign there.

25:56.448 --> 26:00.152
Matter of fact, the sign that you just saw there is right there on Highway 79.

26:00.352 --> 26:04.836
And you go up there about two miles up the Rock Road and...

26:04.816 --> 26:05.618
And you are.

26:05.638 --> 26:07.261
It's just a beautiful place that you have.

26:07.281 --> 26:08.704
Well, we think it is.

26:09.045 --> 26:13.073
And you'd be surprised at the number of people that end up there just looking.

26:13.093 --> 26:16.040
Saying, well, we wanted to see what the end of the road was.

26:16.661 --> 26:19.587
So we say, come on out and sit down on the porch with us.

26:19.607 --> 26:20.409
Yeah, you go up the road.

26:20.429 --> 26:22.493
As a matter of fact, you get a sign that says you're almost there.

26:22.533 --> 26:23.335
You're halfway there.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.377
You're just about there.

26:24.357 --> 26:25.658
You have two children.

26:25.678 --> 26:28.081
You have five grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

26:28.101 --> 26:32.505
And I know that you're very proud of them and wish we could talk more about them, but we are out of time.

26:32.525 --> 26:35.708
But I appreciate your service and what you do, and it's been a pleasure.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.849
Well, thank you very much.

26:36.990 --> 26:37.710
I enjoyed it.

26:38.331 --> 26:41.274
That's why we're in the people business out there.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.055
Indeed.

26:42.175 --> 26:43.516
And I thank you for asking me.

26:43.536 --> 26:44.597
Thank you, Lawrence.

26:44.617 --> 26:52.525
Lawrence and Rachel DeZavala have two children, five grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, and a grand life on their beautiful farm north of Franklin.

26:52.505 --> 26:57.891
They have earned it for their service, and we salute Sergeant Lawrence DeZavala as we do all veterans.

26:58.313 --> 26:59.237
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:59.257 --> 27:01.789
Join me next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:01.789 --> 27:11.789
[Silence.]

27:11.789 --> 27:21.789
[Silence.]

27:25.883 --> 27:36.015
people that don't talk enough and I'll be about halfway through the show and I'll think, boy, I've got 15 more minutes here and I'm out of stuff to talk about.

27:36.035 --> 27:44.524
And then I've got people that will get into this, you know, little bitty detail about things, you know, and I'll think I got it, you know, that's too much detail.

27:44.544 --> 27:48.869
I got to get him, got to get more general because we're almost out of time, but you were perfect.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.272
I don't get many perfect.

27:51.292 --> 27:51.913
Hang on right there.

27:51.933 --> 27:53.815
I'm going to do a couple of promos right here.

27:54.335 --> 28:00.254
You don't have to do anything, but just look at that camera right there, and I'm going to look at it with you, and we're going to do a couple of promos here.

28:00.274 --> 28:01.318
And they say that they're ready.

28:02.642 --> 28:03.545
Okay.

28:05.632 --> 28:06.615
Okay, I'm going to go ahead.

28:07.116 --> 28:07.618
Here we go.

28:10.298 --> 28:18.792
Lawrence DeZavala served his country as a radio operator and gunner aboard a B-24 of the Air Force's 379th bomber group in World War II.

28:19.233 --> 28:23.079
He flew some 21 combat missions, mainly into Austria near the end of the war.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.387
And now he and his wife, Rachel, enjoy the fruits of their careers, literally.

28:27.968 --> 28:36.542
I'm Tom Turbiville, inviting you to meet Lawrence DeZavala on Veterans of the Valley, Friday at 8.30, Saturday and Sunday at 6.30, right here on KAMU-TV.

28:40.488 --> 28:46.061
Well, it was right.

28:46.082 --> 28:49.369
I looked at my clock and I bet that was right at 30.

28:50.412 --> 28:51.094
We'll do another one.

28:52.517 --> 28:54.582
Okay.

28:57.413 --> 29:06.103
