00:26.407 --> 00:30.937
Hello and thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.957 --> 00:41.599
You know, he grew up in a small Texas town amid the gently rolling hills of the coastal plains down around Victoria, Cuero, Goliad, if you're familiar with that area of DeWitt County.

00:41.619 --> 00:43.483
A little place called Yorktown, Texas. 

00:43.504 --> 00:47.031
And by the way, it's the home of the annual Western Days Festival.

00:47.011 --> 00:50.294
And it's still there and you can google it if you feel the urge.

00:50.314 --> 00:51.675
He went to Texas A&M.

00:51.715 --> 00:59.082
He was the class of 1944B and he joined the Army Air Corps and flew 35 missions in a B-17 bomber.

00:59.623 --> 01:05.208
THe type of plane made famous by movies like 12 O'Clock High with Gregory Peck and the Memphis Bell.

01:05.789 --> 01:11.094
Veterans of the Valley welcomes B-17 bomber pilot Taylor Riedel to today's show.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.275
Taylor, thank you for joining us.

01:12.455 --> 01:13.356
Thank you.

01:13.994 --> 01:19.091
Pick us up from basically Texas A&M, the class of 44, and you joined the Army Air Corps.

01:19.111 --> 01:22.502
What transpired after that?

01:23.258 --> 01:27.664
I got called on to active duty shortly in 43.

01:28.866 --> 01:33.071
And I was actually, strange, I was a class of 44 at A&M.

01:33.152 --> 01:46.770
I was in the class of 44B with Air Corps in the cadet training program, which meant that I was scheduled to get my wings in February of 44.

01:47.251 --> 01:50.295
So I started my training in...

01:51.052 --> 01:52.473
February of 43.

01:52.493 --> 01:52.934
In 43?

01:53.234 --> 01:53.715
43.

01:53.975 --> 02:03.905
They first sent us, like anyone else who joins the service, to a basic training facility out in Wichita Falls, Shepherd Field.

02:03.925 --> 02:09.050
And we were there about six weeks doing normal Army stuff while training.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.191
Learning to march.

02:10.371 --> 02:13.595
Learning to march, that's right.

02:13.655 --> 02:21.042
Then they sent us from there out to California to

02:21.022 --> 02:24.688
to kind of schedule, see what they wanted to do.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.030
Now, was that King City, California?

02:26.250 --> 02:31.859
No, this was... I can't think of the name of it right now.

02:32.059 --> 02:34.563
Anyway, we would just say a short period of time.

02:35.144 --> 02:39.030
And they instituted a new program at that time where

02:39.010 --> 03:08.882
instead of sending you directly into your pre-flight training and so forth they sent sent you to various universities in the country for training and since it was a new program they set it up for uh it's a three months program but they set it up the first group it went were six weeks the second one two months and the third one three months so they could kind of ramped it up it ramped it up and there they gave you all kind of tests and things and determine whether to assign you to uh

03:09.520 --> 03:16.088
pilot training, or navigator training, or bomber training, or bombardier training, whatever.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.172
And from there, then you start your training.

03:19.213 --> 03:22.957
And I was lucky and drew pilot training.

03:24.379 --> 03:25.701
Did you have a preference before that?

03:26.141 --> 03:27.163
Yeah, I had a preference.

03:27.403 --> 03:27.964
And what was that?

03:28.224 --> 03:36.675
My preference was to fly a P-38, you know, that was a twin engine fighter.

03:37.162 --> 03:42.110
They didn't make that decision at that time.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.033
Everybody took the same primary training.

03:44.574 --> 03:47.959
So we went to King City, California for primary training.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.281
Primary flight training.

03:49.342 --> 03:50.684
Primary flight training.

03:50.704 --> 03:54.630
We flew a little, like a cub type plane.

03:54.847 --> 04:04.044
Then after you completed that, if you did, they sent you to basic training, and that was also out in California.

04:04.064 --> 04:11.978
And from there, then they sent you to advanced training, and that's when I found out that they had assigned me to a four-engine

04:11.958 --> 04:15.062
training instead of two engine for the P-30.

04:15.082 --> 04:16.543
And that was out in what, Douglas, Arizona?

04:16.563 --> 04:17.505
Douglas, Arizona.

04:17.605 --> 04:17.845
Right.

04:18.065 --> 04:18.506
Yeah.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.708
Excuse me, I said California, Douglas, Arizona.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.389
Okay.

04:21.409 --> 04:24.553
It's where we actually did the training.

04:25.053 --> 04:29.078
And Douglas, Arizona was right on the border from Mexico.

04:29.138 --> 04:33.143
You could walk back and forth across the bridge, Kingman and Douglas.

04:33.263 --> 04:37.468
So we, I mean, Pedro Snaggers.

04:37.488 --> 04:37.908
Okay.

04:37.928 --> 04:40.892
Yeah, so that's where, now that was Douglas, Arizona.

04:40.932 --> 04:41.813
Yeah, okay.

04:42.181 --> 04:48.090
Anyway, we took primary flight training, I mean, four-engine flight training.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.414
Actually, it was two-engine, but we were preparing for it.

04:51.195 --> 05:02.974
Then they sent us out to Salt Lake City for a short period of time to kind of assemble the crews and do some basic flight training.

05:03.848 --> 05:08.213
Okay, so there, that's where you basically formed your, what, 10-man crew?

05:08.453 --> 05:10.536
Yeah, right, 10-man crew, yeah.

05:10.876 --> 05:13.960
So that's where you get your crew together, and then what happened?

05:14.200 --> 05:23.431
Well, then they sent us to Ardmore, Oklahoma, to do quite a bit of flight training in the B-17.

05:24.232 --> 05:27.055
And from Ardmore, Oklahoma, then we were assigned

05:27.659 --> 05:29.602
to go overseas.

05:29.622 --> 05:42.783
So we left Ardmore and went to Lincoln, Nebraska and picked up a B-17 and flew it into Scotland, Newfoundland and Greenland.

05:42.863 --> 05:53.700
So what's your early 20s at that point in time and the Army Air Corps is fixing to turn a B-17 bomber over to you and nine other gentlemen to

05:53.680 --> 05:58.393
And fly basically across the ocean and land it someplace in Britain.

05:58.554 --> 05:59.296
Right, right.

05:59.516 --> 06:01.181
What was going through your head about that time?

06:01.201 --> 06:04.450
Oh, well, you know, we were excited about it.

06:05.138 --> 06:13.189
We weren't looking forward to combat as such, but we were excited in getting on with the war.

06:13.209 --> 06:14.351
How long of a flight was that?

06:14.371 --> 06:15.553
Do you remember going from that?

06:15.573 --> 06:17.215
That's quite a ways over the water.

06:17.315 --> 06:18.237
Well, we landed.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.059
We landed at Greenland.

06:20.079 --> 06:20.460
In Greenland.

06:20.580 --> 06:20.840
Yeah.

06:21.041 --> 06:27.910
And I think we landed in Nova Scotia, too, and picked up fuel and then went to Greenland.

06:28.451 --> 06:33.238
And from Greenland, we flew into Scotland, and we turned the aircraft over

06:35.024 --> 06:36.948
to the 8th Air Force there.

06:36.968 --> 06:37.308
I got you.

06:37.328 --> 06:40.895
That's a lot of traveling for a young man from Yorktown, Texas.

06:41.095 --> 06:41.897
Right.

06:41.917 --> 06:45.944
What was going through your head of going through all these places and then all of a sudden ending up in Great Britain?

06:46.185 --> 06:47.447
Oh, it was great fun.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.190
That part was good.

06:49.531 --> 06:51.254
It was exciting.

06:52.016 --> 06:55.763
So where did you put down at in England there for the... In Scotland.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.304
In Scotland.

06:56.544 --> 06:57.606
I don't...

06:57.805 --> 07:15.481
Remember, actually, we just landed it and left the plane, and then they assigned us to the 306 bomb group, which was located in Luton, which is on the main railway line between London and Scotland, about 30 minutes out of London.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.447
So we were stationed only about 30 minutes from London.

07:18.494 --> 07:19.896
Oh, that was pretty good duty, though.

07:19.936 --> 07:20.898
Oh, yeah, that was good duty.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.121
Did you visit London much?

07:23.321 --> 07:25.004
Yeah, we sure did.

07:26.185 --> 07:32.735
We got frequent passes, and we'd go down, just go down to the train station, get on the train, and go into London.

07:32.895 --> 07:41.608
And you were also part of the 306th Bomb Group, but you were also part of what was, I believe, the 423rd Bomb Squadron.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.351
Tell us a little bit about the 423rd.

07:43.411 --> 07:46.375
Well, the 423rd was...

07:46.726 --> 07:48.570
They had been over there quite a while.

07:48.590 --> 07:55.587
They're one of the early groups to go over, and they have three squadrons in each group.

07:57.832 --> 07:58.694
Or four, is it?

07:58.755 --> 07:59.597
I don't know, anyway.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.260
And how many planes are in a squadron?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.448
Well, on a combat mission, there are 12.

08:04.715 --> 08:05.136
Okay.

08:06.157 --> 08:06.417
Okay.

08:07.158 --> 08:08.240
Is that normal?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.822
Yeah.

08:10.042 --> 08:12.365
Basically in groups of six, three.

08:13.386 --> 08:13.567
Okay.

08:14.268 --> 08:20.496
And six, three up and three down, and then you had one, two, three of those forming the squadron.

08:20.536 --> 08:22.939
What was the significance of up and down?

08:23.280 --> 08:31.971
Well, with the armament on the B-17, the ball turret gunner, the tail gunner, the

08:31.951 --> 08:43.478
the side gun and so forth, it set up a field of fire around that group of planes to protect you from the German fighters.

08:44.962 --> 08:47.327
So that's what that maintained.

08:47.459 --> 08:55.321
What was, when you got your call to do your very first mission, I believe, over to Cannes, France, what was going through you and your crew's head?

08:56.303 --> 08:59.432
Oh, of course, we were excited and apprehensive.

09:00.134 --> 09:03.122
We were thankful, though, that we'd got an assignment to Cannes

09:03.102 --> 09:05.245
France instead of somewhere in Germany.

09:05.265 --> 09:06.648
Somewhere deep within Germany, right?

09:06.768 --> 09:07.970
On the first mission, yeah.

09:08.030 --> 09:09.632
So did everything go okay that first mission?

09:09.652 --> 09:11.415
Yeah, it went fine.

09:11.435 --> 09:14.961
Take us through a normal day, because you didn't fly every day, right?

09:15.001 --> 09:16.022
No, no, no, no.

09:16.202 --> 09:18.085
About every other two, three days, something like that?

09:18.105 --> 09:26.398
Well, you see, I threw 35 missions, and I was over there from June to about a year to fly those.

09:28.422 --> 09:29.363
What happened?

09:30.457 --> 09:39.108
The night before a mission, they would post on a bullet board all the crews that were assigned to fly the next morning.

09:39.548 --> 09:45.776
They didn't say where you were going or anything like that, just that you were scheduled to be in the group.

09:46.637 --> 09:54.027
And they would awaken you about 2 o'clock in the morning.

09:54.047 --> 09:59.113
You'd go down and have breakfast, and then you'd go to a briefing, and then you'd...

10:00.848 --> 10:02.730
check your airplane, get everything going.

10:02.770 --> 10:08.418
And that took a period from about two o'clock till, say, six o'clock.

10:08.438 --> 10:16.988
And then you take off normally around six or seven o'clock, fly, and then come back about eight hours later normally.

10:18.010 --> 10:18.410
Okay.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.713
What goes on in the aircraft

10:21.368 --> 10:26.336
With you and your crew, sometimes you're going for quite a long ways before you actually get to your target.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.878
Is there much chatter?

10:27.959 --> 10:31.404
Is there a lot of checkoffs that go on in the B-17?

10:31.564 --> 10:37.554
Just normal yam, you know, with 10 guys in there and talking about that various thing.

10:38.135 --> 10:38.395
Right.

10:39.277 --> 10:39.537
Yeah.

10:40.158 --> 10:40.759
Okay.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.984
Well, tell us, what about any of the...

10:44.116 --> 10:53.371
particular mission really stick out in your head of things that maybe made it a little bit more dicey or other missions that were more leisurely?

10:53.411 --> 10:58.420
I hate to use that word, but obviously if you're not flying deep into the heart of Germany, you're not going to get that much AAA.

10:59.001 --> 11:05.331
Well, the missions you didn't look forward to, so to speak, you always had 35

11:06.914 --> 11:12.982
in front of your mind that you said, well, this is one and I've got 34 more to go and so forth.

11:13.963 --> 11:19.651
So you always often hope for a mission to Belgium or France or someplace like that.

11:19.911 --> 11:30.205
And the ones that you were, you went deep into Germany, Berlin, for example, would be a hairy one because they protected Berlin the best they could.

11:30.585 --> 11:33.529
And those were tough.

11:35.213 --> 11:36.474
Let's jump back a little bit.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.516
Talk about London.

11:37.596 --> 11:38.557
You went into London.

11:38.577 --> 11:43.703
What about some of the nighttime bombing that we all hear about and the V1 and the V2 rockets?

11:44.224 --> 12:03.246
Well, of course, if you were to go down and go into London, and everybody traveled a lot by subway and so forth, and they were various layers underneath the ground, and they were lined with all the subway platforms.

12:03.867 --> 12:05.710
back were lined with bunks.

12:06.692 --> 12:16.868
And the British people would come down, leave their houses above and come down and spend the night in there for protection from the German bombing.

12:18.270 --> 12:26.764
Well, toward the last of the war, the German bombers didn't come over much anymore because we had established air superiority.

12:27.766 --> 12:30.550
But they came up with two

12:30.867 --> 13:00.165
robots i guess you like a better term right yeah v1 and v2 the v2 was like a little old uh piper cub or something and it it had made a funny sound a putt putt putt putt putt and it flew along and as long as you could hear that putt putt putt you you knew you're all right because it was still flying but when it stopped the putt putt that meant it was going into a glide right and would come down

13:00.567 --> 13:08.772
Now you couldn't do that with the V2 because they were faster than sound and you didn't hear them until they exploded.

13:10.743 --> 13:11.324
Anything else?

13:11.744 --> 13:14.208
No.

13:14.649 --> 13:25.644
I understand there was a little bit of trepidation, I guess, from your mother back at home when you had talked to her and she told your friends basically that you were basically the pilot of a B-17.

13:25.985 --> 13:27.086
And what was their response?

13:27.126 --> 13:29.289
I found that rather... Oh, that was true.

13:29.309 --> 13:36.700
Well, of course, you have to realize in a small town like I grew up in that everybody knew everybody.

13:36.832 --> 13:42.019
And not only did my mother know me, but the neighbor knew me and various ones did.

13:42.941 --> 13:49.691
One neighbor lady told my mother, and my mother relayed over to me, said, you know, I just don't know about our government.

13:49.711 --> 13:55.198
They're entrusting a big, expensive aircraft like that to Taylor.

13:56.621 --> 13:59.244
Did you get to go back later and say, see, I could do it?

13:59.565 --> 14:00.426
No, I don't.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.591
I don't think she told me who it was.

14:02.611 --> 14:03.212
Who said that?

14:03.412 --> 14:04.154
No.

14:04.314 --> 14:05.577
We've got some pictures.

14:05.597 --> 14:08.042
Let's go ahead and let them load up the pictures.

14:08.062 --> 14:09.024
And you can tell us a few.

14:09.044 --> 14:12.171
We've got some really interesting stuff that you were able to give to us.

14:12.191 --> 14:15.478
And let's see what the first one looks like coming up here.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.660
Tell us what this is.

14:16.841 --> 14:26.079
Oh, this is a publication that the 8th Air Force put out about the 8th Air Force telling what they were doing and how they were doing.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.123
More or less like a public relations?

14:28.143 --> 14:29.466
Yeah, public relations type.

14:29.486 --> 14:31.510
Now, was this...

14:31.490 --> 14:37.641
publication, was it for the people on, it was for the Americans, for the Flyboys and for our side.

14:37.861 --> 14:38.723
Yeah, right, right.

14:38.863 --> 14:43.851
Did anything ever go on nowadays where you drop pamphlets to the enemy, that kind of thing?

14:44.052 --> 14:44.573
Oh, yeah.

14:44.593 --> 14:44.773
Oh, yeah.

14:44.793 --> 14:45.695
Did y'all do much?

14:45.875 --> 14:46.516
Yeah, you did.

14:46.556 --> 14:48.720
That was considered a pretty good mission, too.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.022
Okay.

14:50.002 --> 14:51.846
You just go in there and drop some pamphlets.

14:51.926 --> 14:53.669
Do you remember what any of the pamphlets said?

14:54.090 --> 14:55.192
No, not particularly.

14:55.212 --> 14:55.753
Not particularly?

14:55.914 --> 14:56.214
Okay.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.699
Let's get back to the pictures and see what was coming up next.

14:58.739 --> 15:03.930
Now this is the, I guess for lack of a better term, this was the centerfold of that same publication.

15:04.350 --> 15:08.719
And as you can see, it kind of, we've got the original here and it actually tells you

15:09.121 --> 15:13.108
of what all the numbers were about how many bombs were dispatched.

15:13.248 --> 15:14.130
You can see the number there.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.014
I guess that's 221,811.

15:18.076 --> 15:19.178
How many bombs were dropped?

15:19.238 --> 15:19.619
443,969.

15:21.081 --> 15:26.491
How often did this publication come out?

15:27.272 --> 15:27.673
Do you remember?

15:27.693 --> 15:29.776
I don't know.

15:29.876 --> 15:32.040
I don't know that it gives any...

15:32.965 --> 15:39.956
This, I don't think it does, but I just noticed to see it's signed by Jimmy Doolittle.

15:39.976 --> 15:45.125
I was noticing that it is signed by Mr. Doolittle, so that's incredible pretty much.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.567
Let's go over to the next picture.

15:47.168 --> 15:49.371
Okay, and where are you in this picture?

15:49.712 --> 15:50.774
I'm on the far left.

15:50.794 --> 15:52.797
You're the far left, and do you remember where this was at?

15:53.249 --> 15:57.615
This was in one officer's quarters over in England.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.036
Okay, so this was in England.

15:59.076 --> 15:59.717
Yeah.

15:59.737 --> 16:01.139
And tell us who the other gentlemen are.

16:01.520 --> 16:15.537
Well, you know, I'm blank on the two in the middle, but the one on the end, the name was Harry Quint, and he's from California, and after he got out of the service, he went to dental school.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.839
Right, and he's still around.

16:16.859 --> 16:17.460
He still lives.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.242
Yeah, Harry's still alive.

16:19.362 --> 16:21.585
Interesting little sideline on Harry.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.678
He didn't have a middle name or a middle initial.

16:25.918 --> 16:35.337
And in the service, if you didn't, they'd put, like, Harry, N-M-I, no middle initial, Quint.

16:36.059 --> 16:37.021
I can see where this is going.

16:38.524 --> 16:41.089
So Harry picked up a nun.

16:41.389 --> 16:44.215
People would say, if you answer, they called your name Harry.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.698
he'd say none.

16:46.758 --> 16:48.842
Middle initial, he'd say none.

16:48.983 --> 16:51.709
So Harry's nickname was none, Harry Nunn Quint.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.132
That's pretty good.

16:53.372 --> 16:55.176
Do you keep in touch with him?

16:55.196 --> 16:56.399
I have in the past.

16:56.459 --> 16:58.122
I haven't talked to him in a while.

16:58.142 --> 16:58.864
Okay.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.287
And now look at this picture.

17:00.307 --> 17:01.931
That's right off of a poster board there.

17:01.971 --> 17:02.592
That is.

17:02.572 --> 17:04.895
That was taken in primary training.

17:05.135 --> 17:05.716
Okay.

17:05.736 --> 17:07.958
So, so how old were you in that picture right there?

17:07.978 --> 17:08.339
Do you remember?

17:08.439 --> 17:09.600
Well, I was born in 1921.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.903
So that, and that was in 44.

17:11.963 --> 17:14.146
So you're 22 about, I guess.

17:14.226 --> 17:14.566
Yeah.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.730
Depending on what, when your birthday was the year, it would have been 21, 22.

17:18.050 --> 17:18.971
Yeah.

17:18.991 --> 17:22.035
Good looking pilot has ACE written all over it.

17:23.256 --> 17:24.418
Describe this picture for us.

17:24.518 --> 17:27.381
Well, this is a target picture.

17:27.783 --> 17:43.497
What they did when we left the base, come back to the States, if you wanted, they'd give you a copy of all the, if you buy them 35 times, they'd give you the mission photos, one of them, each one,

17:43.628 --> 17:50.455
But they wouldn't let you write on the back of it what it was or what the location they just had it.

17:50.475 --> 17:53.599
And that's one of them of a target over Germany.

17:53.619 --> 17:54.780
Oh, someplace over Germany.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.244
And now, as you can see, obviously, the before picture, that was the night.

17:58.264 --> 18:00.686
You could see the river curving on the right part of the screen.

18:01.067 --> 18:04.711
And obviously now you see that big kind of blotch there right over the river.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.053
Those are the bombs dropping, correct?

18:07.234 --> 18:08.235
Yes, that was the bombs.

18:08.255 --> 18:13.180
They probably were detecting a bridge or a...

18:13.531 --> 18:16.875
manufacturing facility located right there on the river.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.317
And the same thing here, right?

18:18.337 --> 18:23.003
Just another aerial of, and the white stuff you see there is not really clouds below you.

18:23.023 --> 18:26.167
That's probably fires and stuff coming up from bombs that have been dropped.

18:26.187 --> 18:27.509
Right, right, yeah.

18:27.569 --> 18:28.290
Exploited.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.352
All of your missions were during the day, correct?

18:30.493 --> 18:31.554
Right, yeah.

18:31.574 --> 18:34.257
Because I believe the British flew mostly at night.

18:34.538 --> 18:35.539
Was there a reason for that?

18:36.059 --> 18:41.147
Well, the British didn't fly in formation and so forth like we did.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.831
They flew in a string, you know.

18:43.971 --> 18:45.534
Single line type.

18:45.554 --> 18:46.656
Yeah.

18:47.197 --> 18:50.301
And they didn't want to fly.

18:51.083 --> 18:56.211
The British didn't particularly want to fly in the daytime.

18:56.231 --> 19:01.459
And the Americans took that over and protected that, so to speak.

19:01.996 --> 19:09.723
One other thing to look at here, this is, and for the viewers, they can't really read it, but what it is, is it's called the operational sortie record.

19:10.143 --> 19:20.353
And this basically logs every single flight that you had, and you can go right down the list, and we can look at the different cities you bombed around Germany, and in France, and in Holland.

19:20.373 --> 19:28.380
And then down at the bottom, it says 35, so they sign off on it, and you've got your ticket home, more or less, I guess, is how that works.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.822
And this, describe this picture for us.

19:30.987 --> 19:39.508
Well, it's just a picture of a B-17, and on the tail, you'll see a triangle with an H in it, and that was for the 306 bomb group.

19:39.528 --> 19:40.109
Okay.

19:40.209 --> 19:44.440
Was there anything on that plane that designated the 423rd, or was it just always the 306th?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.204
No, it was always the 306th.

19:46.485 --> 19:46.785
Okay.

19:46.906 --> 19:47.848
Yeah.

19:49.128 --> 19:50.310
Now describe this to us.

19:50.891 --> 19:55.438
You told me an interesting little story about this patch, which we actually have the patch with us here.

19:55.458 --> 19:55.759
Yeah.

19:56.180 --> 20:00.948
Well, all the squadrons had an insignia patch.

20:01.068 --> 20:01.909
This is the patch for the 423rd.

20:01.929 --> 20:04.293
423rd.

20:04.313 --> 20:07.879
And you put it on your jacket, you know, that.

20:08.247 --> 20:09.948
leather jacket that you have.

20:09.989 --> 20:18.076
But the Germans took offense at that particular figure there.

20:18.236 --> 20:23.901
I guess you'd call it a ghost or a devil or whatever it was.

20:24.101 --> 20:30.727
And so there were some people, U.S.

20:31.267 --> 20:36.752
people said, well, we think they'd put anybody who has to bail out

20:37.407 --> 20:44.137
and is taken prisoner if they had their jacket on that had this particular patch on it that might subject them to.

20:44.538 --> 20:45.720
So you didn't get to wear your patch?

20:45.940 --> 20:46.441
No.

20:46.461 --> 20:53.292
Well, they didn't give you, by the time I got over there, they quit giving that patch out until you left.

20:53.332 --> 20:54.854
So you couldn't wear it, I guess, yeah.

20:54.894 --> 20:56.577
So when you left, they gave it to you.

20:56.597 --> 20:59.762
Okay, now you've just brought this to us, and what is this?

21:00.142 --> 21:01.564
I find this interesting.

21:01.584 --> 21:05.170
This is a cockpit of the B-17.

21:05.150 --> 21:09.314
And so obviously you would be on the left-hand side, where you can see the wheel.

21:09.714 --> 21:11.776
Do you remember what most of those instruments are?

21:13.418 --> 21:15.980
Well, see, it had four engines.

21:16.160 --> 21:26.070
So there are four dials up there that give the airspeed, I mean, the RPMs, and four of them that give the oil pressure and all that.

21:26.090 --> 21:30.394
So they're really kind of a duplicate of a lot of them there.

21:31.855 --> 21:35.038
But it was fairly complicated.

21:35.660 --> 21:36.381
procedure.

21:37.803 --> 21:44.792
Tell us a little bit, I believe your 30th mission had a little bit of a quirk in it, so to speak.

21:44.812 --> 21:46.134
Fill us in on that 30th mission.

21:46.154 --> 21:51.441
And by the way, let's see, your 30th mission was to... Yes, thank you.

21:51.501 --> 21:52.262
I can't pronounce that.

21:52.282 --> 21:53.785
But obviously it was in Germany.

21:54.245 --> 21:58.030
And just to let the viewers know, it says here that it lasted about eight and a half hours.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.092
Right, that's correct.

21:59.392 --> 22:04.519
So fill us in on mission number 30, which you were five short of getting out.

22:04.583 --> 22:17.456
Yeah, well, we went in over Belgium and up lower through the lower part of Germany up into Germany to bomb this deal.

22:17.476 --> 22:29.387
And by the time we got to this point in the year, there were not many German fighters still operational.

22:29.407 --> 22:30.208
Skies were pretty clear.

22:30.248 --> 22:34.152
Skies were pretty clear, and so your main problem was anti-aircraft fire.

22:34.874 --> 22:41.022
And their best weapon was an 88 millimeter anti-aircraft gun that they used.

22:41.042 --> 22:52.636
And so we were about 25,000 feet, I guess, going over this target, 20, 25,000, I'm not sure.

22:53.477 --> 22:58.063
And an 88 millimeter shell went up through the wing

22:58.887 --> 23:03.872
about, oh, about from here to that flag, and went through the gas tank.

23:04.593 --> 23:06.835
So that's no more than maybe eight to ten feet out your window.

23:06.855 --> 23:07.255
Yeah, right.

23:07.495 --> 23:09.097
And it went up above.

23:09.297 --> 23:17.685
Fortunately, it didn't explode until it got above us, and it exploded, but it didn't cause any further damage to the aircraft.

23:17.706 --> 23:19.968
But in going through the wing, I did two things.

23:20.048 --> 23:25.333
It ruptured the gas tank, and so we had gasoline spilling out of the ruptured gas tank.

23:25.938 --> 23:34.027
The other thing it did, you control the pitch on your propeller with a hydraulic system so you can, you know, different speeds.

23:34.047 --> 23:35.048
Right.

23:35.068 --> 23:44.438
And it ruptured those lines to that and the engine, the left, the number two engine started windmilling now.

23:44.458 --> 23:47.782
When windmilling, that means it just turned free.

23:48.402 --> 23:48.522
Right.

23:48.543 --> 23:49.564
You didn't have any control over it.

23:49.584 --> 23:50.865
No control over it.

23:51.655 --> 23:53.918
It started going real fast, faster it got.

23:54.519 --> 23:59.386
Finally it had enough friction to start a fire in that particular engine.

23:59.406 --> 24:01.730
It's time to get out of the plant, sounds like to me.

24:02.090 --> 24:18.774
We were about over Belgium coming back at that time, and we kept looking out, and I finally looked, I said, well, we need to get out of here because there's raw gasoline pouring out of the gas tank, and there's a fire there.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.717
So I gave the signal to bail out.

24:21.490 --> 24:22.591
And we all bailed out.

24:22.671 --> 24:28.157
We were about, oh, 18,000 feet, I guess, when we bailed out.

24:28.177 --> 24:29.718
And everybody landed okay.

24:29.818 --> 24:31.019
The entire crew made it back?

24:31.160 --> 24:31.260
Yeah.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.080
You landed in Belgium?

24:32.341 --> 24:32.961
Yeah.

24:32.981 --> 24:34.122
They picked you up and got you back.

24:34.162 --> 24:35.224
You took a little R&R?

24:35.264 --> 24:35.564
Yeah.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.486
Interesting R&R.

24:38.026 --> 24:45.894
They sent us out to a country estate outside of London, and it was owned by Lord Montbatten.

24:46.975 --> 24:49.978
And his wife was there at the time we...

24:50.667 --> 24:55.972
did our R&R, so I got to meet her and play a little cards with her.

24:56.372 --> 25:01.377
So you got through your 35th mission, anything particular about that last mission or were you just ready to get home?

25:01.597 --> 25:03.098
No, we were just ready to get home.

25:03.178 --> 25:06.441
It was a shorter, it wasn't almost 8 hours and 70 minutes.

25:06.561 --> 25:08.363
Yeah, a lot of your last ones were rather long.

25:08.403 --> 25:18.632
Yeah, I had a total of 351 combat hours in 35 missions.

25:19.338 --> 25:28.151
Part of them didn't, the reason it's more than 35 times 10, say, which would be 36.

25:28.932 --> 25:33.459
Some of them you'd go and come back, you know, and it wouldn't count.

25:35.162 --> 25:40.590
Some missions would be scrubbed, you know, because of weather or other conditions.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.212
We've got just a couple of minutes left.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.536
Is there anything else that you can think of?

25:45.317 --> 25:48.822
No, well, I'll tell you interesting.

25:49.375 --> 25:52.700
I got back in 45.

25:53.121 --> 26:03.737
I came down back to A&M in September of 45 to get my degree.

26:03.777 --> 26:15.535
In the meanwhile, I got married and we lived over, interestingly enough, on the fourth floor of Walton Hall where they made a

26:15.937 --> 26:17.380
They turned it into, I believe, married.

26:17.721 --> 26:18.062
Married.

26:18.162 --> 26:18.803
Married.

26:19.605 --> 26:20.026
Veterans.

26:20.406 --> 26:22.411
Married veterans, yeah.

26:22.431 --> 26:23.653
And that's a whole other story in itself.

26:23.673 --> 26:24.635
That's a whole story.

26:25.036 --> 26:26.600
We've actually run out of time.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.562
Oh, my.

26:27.582 --> 26:28.604
Yeah, it goes quick, doesn't it?

26:28.624 --> 26:29.045
Goes quick.

26:29.325 --> 26:29.606
Sure does.

26:29.626 --> 26:30.047
It sure does.

26:30.067 --> 26:30.628
See, I told you.

26:31.470 --> 26:33.895
I want to thank you for being here with us today, and we appreciate it.

26:33.875 --> 26:36.399
Well, I appreciate you inviting me so much.

26:36.700 --> 26:37.080
Absolutely.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.302
It's our pleasure.

26:38.322 --> 26:43.391
On 8 August 1944, he flew his first mission in a B-17 to Cannes, France.

26:44.012 --> 26:53.767
On 7 March 1945, he flew his 35th and final mission to Gießen, Germany, for about a total of 290 combat hours.

26:53.787 --> 26:56.592
And he had to ditch just one plane during that time.

26:56.572 --> 26:59.957
We salute Taylor Riedel for the commitment he made back in 1944.

27:00.998 --> 27:06.627
He served his country and did the job he was trained to do, and he did it quite admirably.

27:06.647 --> 27:08.970
Shake the hand of someone you see in the armed forces.

27:09.050 --> 27:11.574
Let them know you appreciate the commitment that they have made.

27:12.215 --> 27:19.846
Until next time on Veterans of the Valley, for the entire KMU-TV crew, Mr. Riedel and Tom Turbiville, I'm Kyle Netterville.

27:20.066 --> 27:20.487
So long.
