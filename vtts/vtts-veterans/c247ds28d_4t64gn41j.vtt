00:01.516 --> 00:30.595
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.929 --> 00:32.090
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.051 --> 00:37.856
Before Ivo Junek enlisted in the Army, he was a member of the Tree Army.

00:38.337 --> 00:41.260
It's also known as the Civilian Conservation Corps.

00:41.780 --> 00:48.708
A member of the 91st Infantry Division in the European Theater, he spent most of his combat days in Italy.

00:48.728 --> 00:54.214
While he was serving in Europe, his three brothers served in World War II in the Pacific.

00:54.234 --> 00:58.438
Please welcome with me a proud native of Snook and World War II Gunner.

00:58.756 --> 00:59.697
Ivo Junek.

00:59.717 --> 01:02.501
Ivo, it's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:03.022 --> 01:12.835
I want to jump forward, and then we'll jump back to your getting into the service, but I want to jump forward to you and your brothers all serving in World War II at the same time.

01:13.636 --> 01:15.719
This is kind of an oddity.

01:15.739 --> 01:21.306
Obviously, it was done, but you were all serving at the same time, three brothers in the Pacific and you in Europe.

01:21.327 --> 01:24.751
This must have been a matter of some concern for your parents.

01:24.771 --> 01:27.615
Sort of talk about that dynamic of your service.

01:28.102 --> 01:36.977
Well, I'm sure it was because I know they hated to see us go, but they knew it had to be done.

01:37.317 --> 01:37.578
Right.

01:38.038 --> 01:50.599
And you didn't have cell phones and all the communications you have today, so it was sometimes months before we even

01:51.541 --> 01:59.155
Well, by mail, it usually took about a month for the mail to get over to Europe or the Pacific.

01:59.235 --> 02:00.398
I'm sure it wasn't any better.

02:00.878 --> 02:07.691
They made it, but I did have one.

02:07.751 --> 02:09.535
The oldest brother did not go.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.438
He did get his draft call.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.085
That's an interesting story, too, because he was actually at A&M.

02:15.267 --> 02:20.412
He was at Sebesa Hall serving as a cook, I guess, at Sebesa Hall.

02:20.432 --> 02:29.782
And they didn't want him to go because he was serving his country in a way by cooking for the people that were getting ready to go to the military here at Texas A&M.

02:30.022 --> 02:30.703
Talk about him.

02:30.963 --> 02:38.832
Well, yes, he really started at A&M at Sebesa back by 1936.

02:40.534 --> 02:44.818
And, well, he retired from there later years.

02:45.187 --> 03:12.578
but uh yeah and he was really the only one that like my daddy has never driven anything but a model t ford which had the three pedals right so when they needed something uh he would go check on them at least once a week drove the snook find and uh but the draft board was still going to draft him even though he had three children and uh

03:13.570 --> 03:42.835
I do know that someone from Cebesa, and I'm not going to mention names because I'm not positive, but I think I know who it was, wrote the draft board letter that they ought to be ashamed of their self calling him to serve because he had three children, had parents that needed him, and worst of all, he said, we need him as a cook, and he's doing the same job here he will be doing,

03:42.899 --> 04:07.827
after he if he was to go into service right and so it wasn't no time that they sent him a deferment right and he did not have to go so he was here to take care of my parents while we were all gone i want to talk about your own service in world war ii uh talk about that you you did serve in europe you were in infantry 91st infantry division talk about what

04:08.127 --> 04:09.368
your job was.

04:09.448 --> 04:12.992
You were a gunner with a couple of different weapons.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.134
Talk about what you did.

04:14.294 --> 04:20.120
Well, really, the main job was a gunner on a 155 Howardsey.

04:20.140 --> 04:27.629
I was in the 348 Field Artillery Battalion, which is one of the battalions that was in the 91st Division.

04:30.893 --> 04:35.738
There's about 11 different jobs on a gunner on 155s.

04:36.173 --> 04:44.003
You have your chief of section, your ammunition corporal, your gunner, and the cannon, about six cannoneers, I think.

04:45.805 --> 04:57.119
And really in combat, you may have been assigned to a certain post, but everyone did what they had to do.

04:57.139 --> 05:04.729
You may have been on the, on the gun, the, oh, what?

05:05.890 --> 05:11.412
Well, the sites, at one time, then you may have been loaded

05:12.067 --> 05:19.273
loading the shells on the tray, because one of these shells weighed 98 pounds.

05:19.474 --> 05:19.754
Right.

05:20.174 --> 05:21.976
Plus the fuse.

05:21.996 --> 05:23.237
And then you had to have a fuse.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.741
Someone fuse the shell and set the timing.

05:30.303 --> 05:32.525
We had different fuses.

05:32.545 --> 05:36.389
Some were fused that would go off on impact.

05:36.529 --> 05:40.993
Some fuses went off by timing.

05:41.227 --> 05:49.882
At the time, the sedum was given to us from the forward observer, who was usually on a high point in front of us.

05:49.902 --> 05:51.665
You had to carry these shells through the mud.

05:51.685 --> 05:57.455
That's one thing you remember exactly how muddy it was when you were serving in the Apennine Mountains in that area.

05:57.535 --> 06:03.505
Yes, before it froze, it rained and rained.

06:03.485 --> 06:13.940
The trucks could not get into the gun sections, so we had to carry these one by one to the gun section.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.169
It was a mess.

06:20.189 --> 06:22.512
We welcomed the freezing weather.

06:22.633 --> 06:22.853
Right.

06:22.873 --> 06:26.017
You remember the date that it froze, November the 11th when it first froze.

06:26.038 --> 06:29.142
The first snow was what we called Armistice Day.

06:29.422 --> 06:29.863
Right.

06:29.843 --> 06:30.904
November 11th.

06:31.065 --> 06:31.325
Right.

06:31.685 --> 06:34.729
And we didn't see the ground again until sometime in March.

06:34.809 --> 06:36.351
Yeah, but it was easier to walk through the snow.

06:36.512 --> 06:37.253
Oh, very much.

06:37.993 --> 06:41.638
It seemed like it wasn't too bad.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.144
The snow wasn't bad at all compared to the drizzling and freezing rain.

06:46.284 --> 06:46.524
Right.

06:47.466 --> 06:48.747
You ought to backtrack a little bit.

06:48.767 --> 06:57.859
You had gone over, when you went over, you landed in Scotland and then from England, you actually went to Normandy Beach.

06:58.193 --> 07:01.399
but didn't stay there because you were then called to Italy, right?

07:01.799 --> 07:02.000
Right.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.704
See, now this was not on D-Day.

07:04.865 --> 07:05.245
Right.

07:05.265 --> 07:07.910
By the way, D-Day was my 21st birthday, too.

07:08.812 --> 07:08.932
I see.

07:08.952 --> 07:09.693
This was after.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.556
Yeah, this was a couple of months after D-Day.

07:11.757 --> 07:12.418
Right.

07:12.438 --> 07:18.909
And we went, got far at Cherbourg, and the casualties were heavy in Italy.

07:19.691 --> 07:23.357
So they flew us in the...

07:25.126 --> 07:27.129
on into Italy.

07:27.149 --> 07:28.652
It took us two days.

07:29.513 --> 07:33.239
We stopped to spend the night in Lyon, France, and then flew the rest of the way.

07:34.261 --> 07:43.536
And I didn't think about this the other day, but I was sitting in the pilot's seat.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.560
The pilot went back, put it on automatic power.

07:46.581 --> 07:47.522
I was in charge of the group.

07:47.907 --> 07:51.171
of the soldiers that was on the plane.

07:52.072 --> 07:59.221
And so he put me in his seat while the co-pilot was there, and we were riding along heavy over in the clouds.

08:00.342 --> 08:02.926
And we were flying in formation.

08:04.888 --> 08:11.556
And all of a sudden, we hit a bright spot, no clouds at all, and there was a big old rock sticking out of it.

08:11.576 --> 08:14.139
And so he kind of gave me a little thing.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.102
He said, if you want to go up, you've got to pull back.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.003
If you want to go down,

08:17.320 --> 08:22.874
First time I've ever been in a cockpit of a plane.

08:23.596 --> 08:31.836
And so I pulled it and the other pilot, he did the same thing and we just went up

08:32.660 --> 08:37.205
And we dodged it because we were flying low over the Alps.

08:37.566 --> 08:38.587
Right.

08:38.607 --> 08:42.091
And we flew into Pisa and then we circled.

08:42.331 --> 08:45.555
I saw the leaning tire from there before I saw it on the ground.

08:45.575 --> 08:46.496
Indeed, indeed.

08:46.756 --> 08:50.781
That must have been a little frightening, a rookie pilot looking up and there's a mountain in front of it.

08:50.801 --> 08:53.104
Well, the pilot told me, he says, you know what?

08:53.184 --> 08:55.967
You were as close to death as you'd ever be without dying.

08:56.268 --> 08:57.049
Oh my goodness.

08:58.351 --> 09:07.787
But what I was going to say then, about six or seven years ago, we made several trips back to Europe since.

09:08.287 --> 09:14.918
And we were up in Switzerland and you go up that high,

09:14.898 --> 09:19.224
you don't get the, there's no gasoline engines.

09:19.244 --> 09:22.549
It's all electric, even the tracks pulling you up.

09:22.569 --> 09:29.699
But when we got up there, saw Matterhorn sticking out of the snow and that looked like the same piece of rock that I see.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.742
They ran into.

09:32.603 --> 09:36.148
So I'm not sure that that was it, but it sure looked the same.

09:37.210 --> 09:44.500
And I forgot about that until I saw that piece, that Matterhorn sticking out from under the snow.

09:44.581 --> 09:51.570
You said that there were several consecutive days of resistance that you encountered in the Apennine Mountains.

09:51.888 --> 09:53.149
and that area.

09:53.169 --> 09:55.451
Talk a little bit about that.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.595
You talked about how the enemy would come out of tunnels.

09:59.636 --> 10:10.366
It kind of reminded me of sort of Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima over Japan, how the Japanese tactics of fighting were sort of the same way, that they would dig tunnels, and that's what you were sort of fighting against.

10:10.386 --> 10:12.228
Sort of talk about the resistance that you saw.

10:12.248 --> 10:17.733
Well, most of the tunnels, they had what we called railroad guns.

10:17.753 --> 10:21.777
They were big guns on a railroad track that pulled them back in,

10:22.381 --> 10:25.145
And they pull out and fire and then pull back in.

10:26.067 --> 10:31.335
And I don't know what side of the shell they fired, but it was big.

10:31.355 --> 10:39.328
And what really helped, I guess, being in artillery was probably one of the safest places being on the front line.

10:40.069 --> 10:43.815
Because even people behind us got shelled with the big guns.

10:43.913 --> 10:48.478
You know, we got strafed in the small fire, but the big fire went over us.

10:49.759 --> 10:54.144
You could hear those projectors going over us.

10:55.685 --> 11:10.881
But, you know, we were, to me, I never felt like, I never really felt, I knew I was in danger, but I mean, I didn't feel like I was going to ever get wounded or killed or anything.

11:11.442 --> 11:12.823
There were a lot of casualties.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.329
but you never felt like you were going to be one of them.

11:15.349 --> 11:16.050
You were doing your job.

11:16.891 --> 11:27.081
Now I did have, I was close enough to catch the explosions where the flash of a, uh, one of my buddies hit my face.

11:28.182 --> 11:35.209
And, but that was, then I did get threatened to part my hair once.

11:35.349 --> 11:36.770
I didn't have my steel helmet on.

11:36.810 --> 11:39.933
I guess that, that taught you something there.

11:40.594 --> 11:41.595
Talk about, uh,

11:41.980 --> 11:42.941
Is it Livonia?

11:43.201 --> 11:45.083
Livignana?

11:45.163 --> 11:45.624
Livignana.

11:45.904 --> 11:46.505
Livignana.

11:46.685 --> 11:46.925
Yeah.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.287
Talk about that.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.770
Well, that... That was in Italy, right?

11:50.790 --> 11:51.650
That was in Italy.

11:52.071 --> 11:53.853
That was between us and Bologna.

11:54.093 --> 11:54.353
Right.

11:54.794 --> 11:59.879
And it's on the north side of the Apennines.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.421
It's a high point.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.523
Good observation point.

12:03.543 --> 12:11.532
And then Mount Madone, I think, was the next one down that was real...

12:11.731 --> 12:15.837
And we, it was supposed to have changed hands three times in one day.

12:16.718 --> 12:16.838
Right.

12:16.858 --> 12:30.659
And when we finally took Liver and Yana and Little Beyond, well, the casualties were terrible.

12:30.699 --> 12:35.626
In fact, there was one corner that the infantryman named Purple Heart Corner.

12:36.327 --> 12:39.932
Because every time they tried to get around there, they got...

12:40.874 --> 12:43.798
Wounded or killed.

12:44.900 --> 13:03.727
But naturally by that time there was freezing, snow was on the ground, and the bodies froze and they'd put them in mattress covers and hauled out on a truck, kind of like, well, like we used to say, stack cordwood.

13:04.128 --> 13:05.670
Right, right.

13:06.191 --> 13:08.674
How old were you at this time?

13:08.694 --> 13:09.115
About.

13:09.155 --> 13:09.716
I was 21.

13:09.736 --> 13:10.577
21.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.446
You were still a young kid from Snook, Texas.

13:14.466 --> 13:14.786
Right.

13:16.810 --> 13:19.995
You said you were just doing your job, but you're a young guy.

13:20.015 --> 13:21.258
There's people shooting at you.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.119
You're shooting at people.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.002
You're seeing bodies.

13:24.784 --> 13:31.215
How does a young man process that?

13:33.524 --> 13:50.825
I don't know, I guess we were trained to do that because I can remember when I first went to Fort Knox, one of the first speeches I've heard, and I don't know if it was a general, a lieutenant, or just another private, but they had us there.

13:51.546 --> 13:55.550
First thing he said, you must learn to kill or get killed.

13:55.570 --> 13:58.173
In other words, you have to learn to kill or get killed.

13:58.414 --> 13:59.515
Right.

14:01.115 --> 14:05.140
I guess that's why, you know, you knew you had things to do.

14:05.180 --> 14:11.488
Now, we were trained for hand-to-hand combat, which I never had to get into.

14:11.948 --> 14:20.279
I would say that that would be probably the worst thing a person would have to do in hand-to-hand combat.

14:20.439 --> 14:20.759
Indeed.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.705
We hear the term so much now since Tom Brokaw invented it, the greatest generation.

14:25.725 --> 14:29.670
But it's stories like this that make us, I think,

14:30.224 --> 14:36.252
find out why they're called the greatest generation, certainly a unique generation as far as how they felt about life and death.

14:36.733 --> 14:39.176
It's different, certainly, than it was today.

14:39.737 --> 14:47.868
I want to go to some photographs because you have some magnificent photographs of you and your outfit and some of your war buddies.

14:48.589 --> 14:50.832
And I'd like to go to those now and have you talk about them.

14:50.852 --> 14:54.317
First off, that's a wonderful portrait of you.

14:55.719 --> 14:56.961
How old were you there?

14:56.981 --> 14:58.543
You look like a rookie there.

14:59.637 --> 15:00.439
When was that taken?

15:02.483 --> 15:03.405
Sometime in 43.

15:03.625 --> 15:04.427
In 43.

15:05.549 --> 15:07.153
Just as you were going in.

15:07.173 --> 15:07.433
Right.

15:07.453 --> 15:11.041
Shortly after I was in, I'd say 43.

15:11.241 --> 15:12.123
It had to be.

15:12.524 --> 15:12.744
Right.

15:12.764 --> 15:17.274
You were inducted in February of 1943, so it was probably right around there.

15:17.955 --> 15:18.777
Good looking soldier.

15:19.229 --> 15:20.011
Let's move on.

15:20.091 --> 15:20.933
What are we looking at there?

15:21.013 --> 15:22.897
Now, that was in training here in the States.

15:23.539 --> 15:27.548
See, that's a self-propelled M7 tank.

15:27.568 --> 15:30.735
That turret there is a 50-caliber machine gun.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.020
And you're holding the shell at the bottom left, right?

15:34.023 --> 15:35.145
Now, those are small.

15:35.429 --> 15:36.050
Those are small.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.131
Those aren't the 98 pounds.

15:37.211 --> 15:37.532
Oh, no.

15:37.632 --> 15:38.714
One person handles those.

15:39.595 --> 15:39.975
Okay.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.902
And that's also in the States.

15:45.703 --> 15:46.364
Right.

15:46.384 --> 15:47.646
Now, what are you sitting on there?

15:47.686 --> 15:49.929
Oh, that's the breech of the gun.

15:50.310 --> 15:56.719
See right where my leg kind of comes over and see those two lines on each side?

15:57.299 --> 16:02.086
That's how the recall comes back on those, all the way to the end.

16:02.106 --> 16:02.667
On those tracks.

16:02.787 --> 16:03.428
On those tracks.

16:03.745 --> 16:11.415
And that little hole that's right below me, that's where the shell, you shove it in there and then it closes.

16:11.435 --> 16:12.777
I see.

16:12.797 --> 16:13.298
Okay.

16:13.318 --> 16:14.559
I never noticed that before.

16:14.699 --> 16:15.460
Right.

16:15.481 --> 16:17.844
There's another picture, I guess, same time.

16:18.004 --> 16:19.065
That shows a little bit better.

16:19.105 --> 16:22.510
Well, that's getting ready to load the shell.

16:22.910 --> 16:23.171
Right.

16:24.532 --> 16:25.093
Right.

16:25.113 --> 16:26.135
These are marvelous pictures.

16:26.755 --> 16:32.503
Okay, now this is, we haven't really talked about you going overseas, but you left from New York Harbor.

16:32.787 --> 16:40.114
And this picture was taken at Times Square, you and your buddies enjoying a little refreshment before you headed over to Europe, right?

16:40.315 --> 16:43.338
Yes, I found this just a few days ago again.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.200
And that's you on the right?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.441
That's me on the right.

16:48.303 --> 16:51.526
Then there's one next to me.

16:51.546 --> 16:52.547
He was from Minnesota.

16:53.768 --> 16:55.890
His last name is Havisto.

16:57.172 --> 16:59.294
And the third one, I don't remember his name.

16:59.774 --> 17:01.596
I remember the face.

17:01.762 --> 17:04.788
The next one would be a guy named Herod.

17:06.251 --> 17:14.065
And then the next to the last, I don't remember, but the third, the last one was named Ralph Motz.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.029
I still remember those.

17:17.672 --> 17:19.095
I think...

17:19.379 --> 17:24.526
The other two, I don't believe were in our gun sections or maybe not even in our battalion.

17:24.546 --> 17:26.388
Well, it's only 65 years ago, Ivo.

17:26.408 --> 17:29.292
I wouldn't expect you to remember all the names.

17:29.592 --> 17:30.553
That's a long time ago.

17:30.834 --> 17:34.678
Look at the faces, though, there of those soldiers.

17:34.859 --> 17:41.407
And I looked at those faces, and those are guys who are not, you know, they're not under duress.

17:41.647 --> 17:44.251
They're not protesting where they're about to go.

17:44.851 --> 17:49.217
These are guys that you can just see by the look on their face that are proud to go serve in the war.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.304
And they're looking forward to going over.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.246
That's a marvelous picture.

17:53.427 --> 17:53.947
It really is.

17:54.488 --> 17:56.270
Let's move on to the next one.

17:56.351 --> 17:57.713
This is your volleyball team?

17:58.373 --> 17:59.595
That's our volleyball team.

17:59.675 --> 18:06.485
After the war was over, we were up in, right out of Trieste.

18:07.386 --> 18:10.210
They're on the Yugoslav border.

18:10.595 --> 18:17.987
We spent around the first of August there from May, last of May to the first of August.

18:18.027 --> 18:19.730
This must have been June or July.

18:20.611 --> 18:23.476
So we had to have something for a little entertainment.

18:23.496 --> 18:26.621
So we had volleyball teams, volleyball tournaments.

18:26.861 --> 18:27.121
Right.

18:27.722 --> 18:29.505
And that was our team.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.767
I think we won the tournament.

18:30.787 --> 18:31.949
That's where we got our picture.

18:33.051 --> 18:34.733
And I can remember.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.318
You're in the bottom left there again, right?

18:37.338 --> 18:37.458
Right.

18:37.478 --> 18:38.239
Well, actually.

18:39.907 --> 18:43.231
Now, a while ago, we said left was facing it to the left.

18:43.531 --> 18:45.893
Well, as we're looking at the picture, you're on the bottom left.

18:45.953 --> 18:46.474
Is that correct?

18:47.095 --> 18:48.016
Of the picture?

18:48.096 --> 18:48.296
Uh-huh.

18:48.776 --> 18:49.297
Yeah, as we're looking.

18:49.317 --> 18:49.958
Right, right.

18:50.799 --> 18:52.460
Okay, as we're looking at the picture.

18:52.921 --> 18:55.363
And I can't remember the lieutenant's name.

18:55.403 --> 18:56.384
He was a nice guy.

18:56.545 --> 18:56.865
Right.

18:57.085 --> 18:59.648
And I can't remember the other guy's name.

18:59.908 --> 19:00.489
Right.

19:00.509 --> 19:05.374
The tall one, let's start from left to right.

19:05.557 --> 19:07.139
Can't remember his name.

19:07.159 --> 19:08.320
The other one, gosh.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.442
That's okay.

19:10.462 --> 19:11.303
I asked the other day.

19:11.363 --> 19:18.009
Now, I remember the one, the tallest one standing there is Jack Patterson from Salt Lake City.

19:18.269 --> 19:18.570
Okay.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.692
His name was J-A-P.

19:21.232 --> 19:21.332
Yeah.

19:21.352 --> 19:22.493
We called him a Jap.

19:22.613 --> 19:29.600
And I talked to him.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.543
I found him...

19:33.991 --> 19:41.803
About four or five years ago, no longer than, about seven years ago, we were going flying to Alaska and we had a layover in Salt Lake City.

19:42.484 --> 19:46.250
So I looked up, Jack A. Patterson, and I called.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.898
And sure enough, it was his home and he was there and I talked to him.

19:50.918 --> 19:51.679
There he was.

19:51.811 --> 19:54.954
And then we kept in contact for a while.

19:54.994 --> 20:01.280
I called last time, last couple of times I called and said there's not a working number, so.

20:01.761 --> 20:04.523
Now he's the fellow on the top right as we're looking at the picture?

20:04.744 --> 20:06.305
As we're facing the picture, to the right.

20:06.325 --> 20:07.646
To the right of standing up.

20:07.787 --> 20:08.307
Standing up.

20:08.327 --> 20:08.968
Yeah, there you go.

20:08.988 --> 20:10.489
All right, let's move on to the next one.

20:11.951 --> 20:12.972
Is that a howitzer?

20:12.992 --> 20:15.874
That's a 155 howitzer.

20:15.894 --> 20:17.916
And that's what we call the ground mount.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.700
Spread those legs out and then they, and

20:22.642 --> 20:25.786
That's about what it took to fire one of those.

20:25.987 --> 20:26.307
Indeed.

20:27.088 --> 20:33.196
Let's move on to the next one because I think we've got, that's pretty much the same group with the howitzer.

20:33.437 --> 20:33.777
It is.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.482
Where's this taken?

20:37.502 --> 20:41.347
You know, that was in the States when we were out in the field.

20:41.948 --> 20:42.930
The ground was frozen.

20:43.210 --> 20:43.470
Right.

20:44.752 --> 20:45.693
That's you out in front.

20:45.874 --> 20:48.557
That's me out in front, yes.

20:48.577 --> 20:48.978
Okay.

20:49.679 --> 20:52.142
I remember a couple of the guys' names yet.

20:52.493 --> 20:53.034
That's okay.

20:53.054 --> 21:06.095
Let's move on to, uh, now these are, are you and your brothers and, uh, it's kind of a rough picture there, but you can, this is taken out of a, a magazine and I believe it says, uh, uh, uh, quartet.

21:06.115 --> 21:06.416
Yes.

21:07.057 --> 21:12.986
Of, uh, Unix from snook in service.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.931
And, uh, so who are we looking at their top left?

21:16.512 --> 21:19.337
Top left is my brother, Ralph.

21:19.357 --> 21:19.497
Uh huh.

21:19.814 --> 21:21.036
Now he was in the Pacific.

21:22.038 --> 21:33.662
He spent about two and a half years, most of the time, or more in the Pacific.

21:34.022 --> 21:35.485
And then the bottom left?

21:35.505 --> 21:36.928
Bottom left is Fred.

21:37.448 --> 21:40.071
Well, he's the oldest of the ones that went in.

21:40.311 --> 21:40.572
Right.

21:40.892 --> 21:41.974
And then the sailor in the middle?

21:42.494 --> 21:43.636
The sailor is in the middle.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.478
Who is that?

21:45.498 --> 21:46.639
And Joe.

21:46.659 --> 21:46.880
Joe?

21:47.180 --> 21:47.480
Okay.

21:48.281 --> 21:49.182
And then that's you on the right.

21:49.763 --> 21:50.063
Right.

21:50.284 --> 21:50.544
Yeah.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.167
And there are the brothers.

21:53.688 --> 21:57.933
Now, this picture was just taken, what, a couple of years ago at the World War II Memorial, right?

21:58.213 --> 21:58.574
Right.

21:58.594 --> 21:59.515
And you all went to visit.

21:59.935 --> 22:01.457
October was a year ago.

22:01.658 --> 22:02.038
Okay.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.543
And that's you and your family.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.545
And children.

22:05.705 --> 22:06.967
No, that's not all the family.

22:06.987 --> 22:07.688
Not all the family.

22:07.709 --> 22:08.530
That's some of the family.

22:08.550 --> 22:11.294
Just children and I think six grandchildren.

22:11.374 --> 22:11.635
Right.

22:11.835 --> 22:12.777
You're sitting there in the middle.

22:12.817 --> 22:16.423
Your wife, Becky, is over there to the left in the back row.

22:16.463 --> 22:20.429
And then you and some children and grandchildren at the World War II Memorial.

22:20.709 --> 22:22.693
I got a chance to visit there this last December.

22:22.753 --> 22:24.476
It's magnificent.

22:24.496 --> 22:25.177
It really is.

22:25.517 --> 22:26.258
It really is.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.180
Indeed it is.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.482
Those are some great pictures.

22:28.698 --> 22:36.829
I want to backtrack a little bit, Ivo, and talk about you getting into the service, a young man from Snook.

22:36.849 --> 22:44.899
And I know that at first they wanted you to, somebody tried to talk you into being in the Seabees, but you went another direction.

22:44.919 --> 22:48.904
Well, the Naval officer there wanted me to join the Navy.

22:49.405 --> 22:49.645
Right.

22:49.926 --> 22:53.530
He said we needed welders in the Seabees, and I was a welder by trade.

22:53.791 --> 22:55.092
Right.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.996
And my leaderman at the shipyard

22:58.769 --> 23:10.005
was all shook up just about a week before that because the Seabees landed on some island in the Pacific before the Marines did and wiped them out.

23:10.025 --> 23:22.963
And I remember that whenever I went there and he was trying to get me to join the Seabees, so I finally said, I just, I mean, joined the Army, the Navy, which they would have been assigned to the Seabees.

23:23.104 --> 23:23.364
Right.

23:23.764 --> 23:25.587
Which would have been a...

23:25.567 --> 23:32.517
a good chance to learn another trade or maybe better myself at the trade I was in.

23:32.597 --> 23:39.928
But I'm not sorry I took the route I did because I did make it back and I don't know what would have happened.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.911
Well, we're not sorry too.

23:42.552 --> 23:46.377
Before we leave and we're running out of time, but Ivo,

23:46.829 --> 23:49.735
You're the first person I know named Ivo.

23:49.755 --> 23:51.619
Talk about that name and how you got that name.

23:52.059 --> 23:59.514
Well, my mother, so I was told, my mother read a book when she was a young girl, The Life of Ivo.

24:00.055 --> 24:00.957
The Life of Ivo.

24:01.021 --> 24:03.464
And she wanted that name.

24:03.504 --> 24:09.131
In fact, when some of her siblings had boys, she'd always tell them, name them Ivo.

24:09.211 --> 24:12.655
I want one of them named Ivo even before she was married.

24:13.677 --> 24:22.067
And so there was one of her nephews was named Ivo.

24:22.874 --> 24:24.256
He lived in Colorado.

24:24.576 --> 24:31.745
Well, he became a school teacher and a football coach down in the valley.

24:32.686 --> 24:36.030
But then finally, I was the fifth born.

24:36.631 --> 24:39.315
And so I got the name of Ivo.

24:39.455 --> 24:40.416
You got the name Ivo.

24:40.897 --> 24:46.063
And until last year, I didn't know what I knew.

24:46.803 --> 25:05.851
that she got the name out of a book, and I knew some other stories, but my three daughters were in, and about four of the grandchildren went to Rome to do some sightseeing, and they were in the trolley going down the street, and my oldest daughter looked at her right.

25:05.891 --> 25:10.117
There she read the sign, Basilica of St.

25:10.277 --> 25:10.617
Ivo.

25:11.419 --> 25:16.506
So next day, they had to go find it, and they even got a picture of it for me.

25:17.262 --> 25:18.443
That's tremendous.

25:18.464 --> 25:22.469
After the war, just to talk briefly, we just got a couple of minutes left.

25:22.549 --> 25:25.472
You went to work for the Lower Colorado River Authority.

25:26.213 --> 25:34.224
You opened a welding shop in Snook, and then you went for a temporary job at Shell Oil in Houston, and that temporary job lasted 38 years, right?

25:34.284 --> 25:35.765
38 years.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.608
What did you do there?

25:37.628 --> 25:37.888
There?

25:38.629 --> 25:43.655
Well, I started out as a general helper, laborer more or less.

25:43.896 --> 25:44.176
Right.

25:44.657 --> 25:46.459
And then...

25:47.823 --> 25:51.748
You know, it was a very good job.

25:52.269 --> 25:53.310
It has a union job.

25:53.390 --> 25:59.177
And as positions come open, you'd sign up.

25:59.257 --> 26:03.222
If you'd want that job, you put your name down.

26:03.282 --> 26:04.784
They call that bidding on a job.

26:04.945 --> 26:05.245
I see.

26:05.345 --> 26:07.708
Well, if you had the seniority to get it, you got it.

26:07.728 --> 26:12.094
But if you didn't, you just stayed where you were till you could.

26:12.114 --> 26:14.877
Well, I had a friend that had worked there for,

26:15.447 --> 26:42.349
uh quite a while in fact he uh he didn't pass his physical for the army or service in world war ii he was working there and he said told my book he said any of these jobs come open bid on them he said you don't have to necessarily stay there if you see something comes open that you like better you can bid on that later right but get your seniority started in the department right so

26:42.548 --> 26:45.030
First job came open was in the warehouse.

26:46.071 --> 26:46.852
And that's where you were.

26:47.032 --> 26:51.997
We're out of time, but I know that that's where you spent your time, 38 years at Shell.

26:52.017 --> 26:54.599
And thank you for being here, but we are out of time.

26:54.719 --> 26:55.740
It all goes too quickly.

26:55.920 --> 26:56.721
It sure does.

26:56.741 --> 26:57.102
Thank you.

26:57.722 --> 27:01.926
Ivo Junek and his wife, Becky, are both cancer survivors.

27:01.946 --> 27:09.433
Both lost their spouses in their retirement years, and they found each other some 18 years ago, and now they enjoy their family.

27:09.768 --> 27:12.874
spending much of their time on their farm near Caldwell.

27:12.894 --> 27:17.323
We salute Ivo Junek for his World War II service as we do all veterans.

27:17.744 --> 27:18.766
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:18.786 --> 27:35.860
Join us again next time on Veterans of the Valley.
