00:13.835 --> 00:33.644
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.664 --> 00:34.645
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:35.300 --> 00:42.149
Bill Harper does not have any real war stories to tell from his two hitches and more than five years in military service.

00:42.169 --> 00:45.533
But the one that he does tell is indeed a witness to history.

00:45.553 --> 00:52.962
November the 1st, 1952, from the deck of the USS Estes near Eniwaytock Island in the Marshall Islands.

00:52.982 --> 00:59.350
Bill Harper was one of those who watched the result of Operation Ivy, the very first hydrogen bomb explosion.

00:59.330 --> 01:05.535
Bill Harper has never discussed his specific duties in regard to Operation Ivy, and he never will.

01:05.956 --> 01:19.467
But he can describe in detail the incredible sight and effect of the detonation of a bomb some 500 times more powerful than the atomic bombs that ended World War II some seven years earlier.

01:19.487 --> 01:29.235
And there are other fascinating stories to tell, like how he got to Texas by sailing down the Illinois and the mighty Mississippi Rivers from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico.

01:29.215 --> 01:33.183
Please welcome William T. Bill Harper to Veterans of the Valley.

01:33.203 --> 01:36.971
It's indeed a pleasure, Bill, to have you and for you to tell your remarkable story.

01:36.991 --> 01:38.334
You enlisted in the Army in 1948.

01:38.414 --> 01:42.162
They were downsizing after World War II, but before Korea.

01:42.445 --> 01:45.871
So you got out in 1950, but then you re-upped again.

01:45.891 --> 01:50.760
And between 1951 and 1954 is when this incredible story unfolded.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.765
And I want to get right to that, Operation Ivy.

01:53.785 --> 02:01.800
Sort of talk about the time that you first found out that you were going to be involved in something a little bit different, a little bit secretive.

02:02.301 --> 02:02.862
Talk about that.

02:02.902 --> 02:04.264
A little bit different is right.

02:04.284 --> 02:04.605
Yes.

02:04.889 --> 02:08.894
Tom, I was stationed in Warrington, Virginia.

02:08.934 --> 02:16.324
I was in the Army Security Agency, which was a branch of CIA in the early days of CIA.

02:17.205 --> 02:22.352
And we were stationed in Warrington, Virginia, in a Signal Corps unit.

02:22.372 --> 02:29.361
And we were told to go home the weekend and tell your family that you're leaving for overseas and you won't be back for some period of time.

02:29.898 --> 02:31.420
We're not telling you where you're going.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.942
We're not telling you what you're going to do.

02:32.962 --> 02:34.805
We're not telling you how long you're going to be there.

02:35.306 --> 02:38.090
But you better tell your wife and family that you won't be back for a while.

02:38.811 --> 02:39.232
So I did.

02:39.292 --> 02:51.349
I went home to Philadelphia from Warrenton, Virginia, hitchhiking both ways, as we did in those days, and told my wife, I'm sorry, I'm leaving courtesy of the Army.

02:51.852 --> 03:03.044
I can't tell you where I'm going or what I'll be doing, but somewhere around your birthday, which was November 11th, you'll probably see something in the news that will give you a clue as to where I am.

03:03.985 --> 03:05.587
Now, I could say that face to face.

03:05.647 --> 03:08.450
I could never write that in a letter because it would have been censored out.

03:08.470 --> 03:12.294
But anyhow, that's what happened when I was given the word.

03:12.314 --> 03:19.362
And we never did know where we were going and why we were going there until we got there.

03:19.814 --> 03:22.198
We shipped out of Washington, D.C.

03:22.318 --> 03:25.422
Gone overseas, they put us on an airplane.

03:25.442 --> 03:27.185
Coming home, they put us on a troop ship.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.909
That's the way the Army does things, I suppose.

03:30.510 --> 03:39.063
But we left Washington National Airport, flew to San Francisco, and then flew over to Annie Waytok.

03:40.064 --> 03:44.811
And we arrived there in August, I think it was, of 1952.

03:44.931 --> 03:45.973
Right.

03:46.358 --> 03:48.962
and were billeted on the island itself.

03:49.022 --> 03:53.369
A lot of the folks in this task force were on ships out in the sea.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.113
We were in tents on the island.

03:56.433 --> 04:00.019
I mean, that's in tents, T-E-N-T-S.

04:00.780 --> 04:04.165
And that's when we found out why we were there.

04:04.482 --> 04:16.597
And it was kind of shocking at the time to realize the import and the historic significance of why we were there.

04:16.617 --> 04:24.567
Being an old Philadelphia boy, I had no no thoughts that I'd ever be involved in anything like this, despite my time with the newspaper.

04:24.715 --> 04:25.196
Right.

04:25.216 --> 04:28.780
You were on the USS Estes, as we said in the beginning.

04:29.401 --> 04:42.298
And while, like you said, very admirably, you took an oath many years ago not to discuss your specific duties, an oath that you honor to this day, it was a communications ship is what it was, is what the Estes was.

04:42.338 --> 04:47.365
Yes, the Estes was the command ship for the entire Operation Ivy.

04:47.530 --> 04:54.817
That's where all the brass was, that's where all the bigwigs were, all the VIPs, and a whole bunch of us slowly GIs.

04:54.837 --> 04:55.057
Right.

04:55.357 --> 04:59.581
This island, any way talk, so people can get an idea, it was small.

04:59.621 --> 05:08.409
You described it as five miles long, about 600 yards wide, six football fields, that's all, wide, and only about six feet above sea level.

05:08.449 --> 05:10.471
Its highest point was six feet above sea level.

05:10.551 --> 05:16.356
And there were literally hundreds or a thousand military,

05:16.775 --> 05:21.280
civilian personnel on this very small strip of land getting ready for this.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.362
And on the boats, on the ships.

05:24.563 --> 05:28.447
A ship carries boats, I have to remember to say ship instead of boat.

05:29.088 --> 05:34.433
Yes, and the VIPs were not on the island.

05:34.674 --> 05:39.018
They were in the captain's quarters or what have you on the ships.

05:39.078 --> 05:42.402
But the lowly GIs were in the tents on the island.

05:43.203 --> 05:45.465
They were going to explode the first hydrogen bomb.

05:45.698 --> 06:07.555
and that's what operation ivy was all about i want you to talk about the the rumor mill because this is a fascinating part of this story because this is something that had never happened before nobody really knew what was going to happen the scientists had an idea but the rumors really ran rampant didn't they did indeed and they covered the waterfront so to speak if i may use that pun no pun intended

06:08.041 --> 06:15.735
We heard rumors that the Russians were out there surrounding us in submarines and spying on the operation.

06:16.536 --> 06:24.070
We heard rumors that the Russians, and remember, this is the beginning years of the Cold War when things were pretty intense.

06:24.090 --> 06:29.079
We had just come out of the Berlin airlift and all that kind of thing, so things were tense.

06:29.099 --> 06:29.239
Mm-hmm.

06:29.692 --> 06:42.912
And we heard rumors that the Russians were going to invade our fleet with their fleet and capture all these scientists and take them back to Leningrad or wherever so that they could develop their own hydrogen bomb.

06:42.932 --> 06:57.133
They had just developed their own atomic bomb the previous year, and that's when President Truman gave the authorization to go ahead with the hydrogen bomb, knowing that now the Russians had the atomic bomb.

06:57.772 --> 07:07.001
But we did have all these rumors floating around, and that's so typical, as you know from your experience, in any kind of a military operation.

07:08.022 --> 07:14.629
And for the record, we learned pretty quickly that if you bet against rumors nine times out of ten, you're going to make money.

07:15.610 --> 07:17.252
But nonetheless, the rumors were there.

07:17.812 --> 07:27.542
Then, of course, there was the, quote, mother of all rumors, unquote, that this thing, when touched off, could ignite the world.

07:28.788 --> 07:30.810
And that's a pretty scary thought.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.093
Indeed.

07:33.113 --> 07:36.076
Well, you know, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to my wife and family.

07:36.136 --> 07:37.378
I didn't know this was going to happen.

07:38.319 --> 07:44.946
So that rumor was really rampant, running all through the tents and on shipboard.

07:45.647 --> 07:52.936
It had pretty much been refuted by scientists in their atomic bomb work.

07:54.397 --> 07:57.681
The same rumor happened with that endeavor.

07:58.285 --> 08:20.783
and we had it with this one and the point is that despite what the scientists say or said this was going to be the first time in the history of mankind that this thing was going to be detonated there was a possibility no matter how remote

08:21.100 --> 08:29.235
there's still that possibility that this thing is going to ignite the world, and we're all incinerated, and that's the end of it.

08:29.255 --> 08:31.058
Well, that'll keep you awake nights if you let it.

08:31.299 --> 08:41.117
Because after all, this was, like we said, this was a force that was some, as I read in my own research, some 500 times

08:41.722 --> 08:46.608
the force of the atomic bombs that had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

08:47.249 --> 08:47.509
That's right.

08:47.529 --> 08:48.390
Who really knew?

08:48.531 --> 08:49.592
Exactly.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.353
Exactly.

08:50.373 --> 08:51.434
Exactly.

08:51.454 --> 09:01.107
Take us to November 1st, 1952, when you all woke up that morning, I guess a few hours before the countdown was to end and the detonation.

09:01.127 --> 09:02.649
Take us through that morning.

09:02.669 --> 09:08.556
Shot time on the morning of November 1st, 1952, was 8 a.m.,

09:09.025 --> 09:16.053
We were up at 4, whether we had the bugle blowing us reveille or what, we were still up in anticipation.

09:16.994 --> 09:21.399
We finished our normal chores of the morning, the mess hall and what have you.

09:22.220 --> 09:27.346
And then we were sent out on deck of the Estes.

09:27.366 --> 09:34.775
I'm sorry, we had come out to the Estes via these LCI landing craft infantry boats from the island to the ship.

09:34.795 --> 09:34.915
Right.

09:35.198 --> 09:39.462
And as a matter of fact, we were furried every day back and forth that way to the command ship.

09:40.343 --> 09:47.129
So we were on the ship and rousted out and came up on deck somewhere, I don't know, 6.30 in the morning.

09:47.149 --> 09:53.295
And there wasn't anything for us to do at this point, at least in my area of interest.

09:53.315 --> 10:01.763
And we went out on deck and just stood around out there smoking cigarettes and making jokes and doing all the things that GIs do in their idle time.

10:02.992 --> 10:13.868
Well, then about 7.15 started the serious countdown, the T minus as all we've seen on the television with the moon shots and what have you.

10:15.110 --> 10:22.081
And the countdown went on, and I was amazed at how precise it was because Honest Engine at 8 a.m.

10:22.141 --> 10:26.527
0000000, that thing went boom.

10:26.547 --> 10:31.615
And when that thing went boom, it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life.

10:31.679 --> 10:36.966
You talked about how some of the higher-ups who had the goggles, the protective goggles, they were okay.

10:37.427 --> 10:46.440
But they had ordered the rest of you to turn away, to put your eyes in the crook of your arm and don't look at this thing.

10:47.141 --> 10:47.401
That's right.

10:47.421 --> 10:51.106
To which you all said, tell them what you did.

10:51.447 --> 10:55.132
Well, if this is the end of the world, Jack, I don't care what you tell me to do.

10:55.152 --> 10:56.374
I'm going to do whatever I want.

10:56.634 --> 10:57.395
Right.

10:57.415 --> 10:58.817
And most of us felt that way.

10:59.135 --> 11:09.507
And we were, as you said, we were told to stand away, you know, 180 degrees away from this target out there and don't look at it because you're going to lose your eyeballs if you do.

11:10.949 --> 11:18.978
And as you mentioned, the scientists and the brass had what looked like welder's glasses on and they could look at it with those glasses.

11:19.078 --> 11:19.699
We could not.

11:20.239 --> 11:22.442
We didn't even have sunglasses to shield us.

11:22.928 --> 11:29.155
But as I said, when you're facing the end of the world, I don't care, court-martial me in the hereafter.

11:29.596 --> 11:30.878
And this was history, after all.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.860
It was, and I didn't want to miss it.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.180
Right.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.885
And neither did anybody else, I think, I'm pretty sure, at that time.

11:36.905 --> 11:49.240
So when we heard the 10, 9, 8, 7, we were standing facing the bulkhead of the ship, and we just slowly, I turned, as they've said on some movie or some such thing.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.282
And we watched it, and we saw it.

11:51.683 --> 11:56.871
And as I'm looking at you right now, there's not been that much effect on my eyeballs.

11:56.931 --> 12:03.401
So it was just an over-exaggeration on the part of the military to not look at this thing because you'll lose your eyeballs.

12:03.822 --> 12:04.122
Indeed.

12:05.544 --> 12:08.268
The brightness of what you saw.

12:08.288 --> 12:09.851
Talk about then what you saw.

12:09.871 --> 12:11.053
There was silence.

12:11.073 --> 12:11.453
Oh, yes.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.056
You saw before you heard.

12:13.557 --> 12:16.741
Well, you know, the speed of light is a lot faster than the speed of sound.

12:16.801 --> 12:19.125
And we were 30 miles away on the ship.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.367
Now, you say 30 miles away.

12:21.387 --> 12:30.795
That was the official distance, although you believe that you were closer because of how much you could see given the horizon that there would have been had it really been 30 miles, right?

12:30.815 --> 12:40.043
There's a rule of thumb that when you're six feet above sea level, you can see seven miles over the horizon.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.426
And we could see over the horizon to where that shot tower was.

12:43.446 --> 12:45.148
So you believe that you were closer than 30 miles.

12:45.228 --> 12:46.749
Between 14 and 30 miles.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.590
Yeah.

12:47.610 --> 12:48.190
Okay, go ahead.

12:48.330 --> 12:49.011
So what did you see?

12:49.396 --> 12:58.166
Well, what we saw, of course, was this explosion, this immense, huge explosion.

12:58.186 --> 13:02.190
But what was eerie was, as you said, there was no sound.

13:02.711 --> 13:06.214
When you see something like that going up, going boom, you expect the boom.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.637
And we didn't hear any boom.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.319
And we wondered what was going on.

13:10.339 --> 13:18.508
But we could see this thing rising up into the air, this fireball, as more brilliant

13:18.961 --> 13:24.446
according to historical writers who were there, than 500 suns.

13:25.247 --> 13:27.589
Somebody called it a dark sun.

13:29.050 --> 13:45.846
This thing was rising from the ground into the air, and it was like everything we'd ever seen about the atomic bombs, the operations at Bikini and the mushroom clouds and the woman's head and hairdo and all those things that were so common on television.

13:46.619 --> 13:53.188
But this fireball and the cloud that went with it rose some 200,000 feet into the air.

13:53.769 --> 13:56.153
And it was only blocked by some straddle layer up there.

13:56.173 --> 13:57.354
I don't know that much about it.

13:57.394 --> 14:00.078
But then it started to spread out.

14:00.519 --> 14:05.406
And it went, I don't know how many miles, a couple of hundred miles, the top of this fireball.

14:06.748 --> 14:12.576
And as we were watching that, and in silence, this eerie silence, what's going on?

14:13.028 --> 14:14.511
There's supposed to be a noise.

14:14.591 --> 14:15.833
There wasn't any noise.

14:16.294 --> 14:23.908
But what there was was the shock wave coming at us across the ocean between us and the device.

14:25.731 --> 14:33.405
And that was scary because we didn't know what was going to happen when that thing, whatever it was, got to us.

14:33.425 --> 14:37.332
Because on one side of it, the far side of it, the water was very dark blue.

14:37.666 --> 14:40.049
It was being rippled by the shock.

14:41.110 --> 14:44.914
On our side, it was smooth, cool, calm, you know, light blue.

14:45.695 --> 14:50.059
But that dark blue was coming at us closer and closer and closer and closer.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.763
And what's going to happen when that dark blue hits us?

14:53.784 --> 14:54.224
It hit us.

14:55.465 --> 14:57.508
It knocked us right to the deck.

14:57.528 --> 15:01.632
Every guy that was standing on that deck around me I know went down to the deck.

15:01.865 --> 15:14.601
And you were the one, I believe, who had yelled at everybody, hang on to something because... I knew something was coming and maybe it was just plain pure fear that I needed an outlet, but I screamed as loud as I could, hold on because that sucker's going to hit us!

15:14.962 --> 15:17.965
Or words to that effect with a few expletives deleted.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.187
Yeah, I'm sure it was just like that.

15:19.207 --> 15:20.308
Yeah.

15:20.348 --> 15:20.529
Right.

15:20.929 --> 15:23.092
And it knocked everybody to the deck.

15:23.112 --> 15:28.058
It knocked everybody down either to the deck or slammed them up against the bulkhead behind them.

15:28.696 --> 15:31.300
Now, I must say that nobody was seriously hurt.

15:31.681 --> 15:36.429
There were a lot of bumps and bruises, but nobody was seriously hurt that I'm aware of.

15:36.449 --> 15:38.853
And then with that came the boom.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.498
And the noise was incredible.

15:41.738 --> 15:43.281
It was absolutely incredible.

15:43.301 --> 15:49.371
And it went on and on and on, ringing in our ears for quite some time after the shockwave was on its way to

15:49.604 --> 15:51.066
San Francisco, I suppose.

15:51.126 --> 15:51.527
I don't know.

15:51.747 --> 15:55.774
You described it not anything like a wind, but more like a terrific G-force.

15:56.134 --> 15:56.495
It was.

15:56.575 --> 16:00.842
It was like being slammed into the back of an airplane going into a dive.

16:00.862 --> 16:02.004
Right.

16:02.024 --> 16:04.368
At least from what I've read about airplanes going into dives.

16:04.728 --> 16:06.271
And, you know, you were just pushed.

16:06.291 --> 16:06.872
You were forced.

16:06.892 --> 16:08.534
You were shoved.

16:09.015 --> 16:11.359
Not just your shoulders, but your entire body.

16:11.499 --> 16:15.645
Every part of your body facing that shock wave was hit at the same time.

16:15.666 --> 16:16.607
It was a wall.

16:17.397 --> 16:19.620
And you were hit by a wall that you couldn't see.

16:20.502 --> 16:26.250
This is a good time right now to see a little bit of what Bill Harper is talking about right now.

16:26.270 --> 16:29.134
And we have some photographs that we're going to show you.

16:29.175 --> 16:32.560
First off, that is a young soldier, Bill Harper.

16:33.221 --> 16:36.125
And can I tell them what I thought you looked like?

16:36.145 --> 16:39.330
I thought that looked like a young Elvis at Fort Hood right after induction.

16:39.350 --> 16:41.112
You want me to sing or strum my guitar?

16:41.192 --> 16:42.274
No.

16:43.182 --> 16:44.183
About how old were you there?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.987
You looked 12, but how old do you think you were?

16:47.007 --> 16:48.008
I was 21, I think.

16:49.050 --> 16:49.731
Good-looking soldier.

16:50.492 --> 16:50.972
Let's move on.

16:50.992 --> 16:59.764
There's the USS Estes, where you actually viewed the detonation from.

17:01.025 --> 17:05.511
This is a pamphlet that you were given, I guess, when you first arrived at

17:06.217 --> 17:11.786
at the Marshall Islands, sort of a description of the operation, which at the time was very, very top secret.

17:11.806 --> 17:15.752
It has since been... And that's one of those bikini shots that's on the cover there.

17:15.952 --> 17:16.393
Exactly.

17:17.194 --> 17:18.757
We've got better pictures than that, though.

17:18.777 --> 17:19.798
Look what's about to come here.

17:20.099 --> 17:23.945
Here's one of the photographs coming up.

17:23.965 --> 17:24.285
Boom.

17:24.686 --> 17:25.247
Wow.

17:26.769 --> 17:29.013
That is an island.

17:29.954 --> 17:34.401
That is a piece of land going up into the atmosphere.

17:34.769 --> 17:40.294
I don't know if that is something like the island of Manhattan.

17:40.494 --> 17:40.974
Yeah.

17:40.995 --> 17:43.357
Not a whole lot smaller than Manhattan Island.

17:43.697 --> 17:47.120
And suddenly Manhattan is gone.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.541
Right.

17:48.561 --> 17:49.562
Right.

17:49.582 --> 17:51.184
We've got other angles.

17:52.785 --> 17:55.407
That's the mushroom cloud that we are so familiar with.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.570
And that dark color at the bottom is that island.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.492
Those are gases up there in the cloud.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.135
But that's the dirt and dust and grit of coral of the island.

18:07.422 --> 18:34.797
and then finally a uh it looks like a beautiful sunset on the beach but it's a it's the fireball it's the fireball absolutely incredible that's right it almost looks like as you say a sunset late at night but that was eight o'clock in the morning eight zero zero zero zero zero in the morning uh 10.4 megatons of explosive power is what that was and like we said that's uh

18:35.030 --> 18:39.017
almost 500 times the power of the bomb that was dropped on the Nagasaki.

18:39.037 --> 18:43.284
Yeah, they were talking kilotons on the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombs, right?

18:43.304 --> 18:43.484
Right.

18:43.765 --> 18:48.412
The effect pattern of this is something like 800 miles.

18:48.733 --> 18:49.194
That's right.

18:49.835 --> 18:56.566
Which I went to my maps, and that's about Galveston to El Paso, if you can think about it.

18:56.586 --> 18:58.189
That's about the width of the state of Texas.

18:58.209 --> 18:58.850
That's right.

18:58.870 --> 18:59.451
That's right.

19:00.089 --> 19:07.569
And not that there was any serious threat from maybe 50 miles and beyond.

19:08.411 --> 19:14.588
But for some forms of plant life or other vulnerable things, it could have an effect, according to the scientists.

19:15.192 --> 19:26.609
You were, the Estes at the time, was situated just outside of what was considered the damage diameter or what could have been the burn diameter, which is a good thing to be just outside of it, right?

19:26.629 --> 19:27.651
Oh, you bet about that.

19:28.352 --> 19:29.754
Although they did warn us.

19:29.774 --> 19:33.640
And that was one of those reasons we were supposed to stand with our back to it.

19:33.660 --> 19:38.567
Not only the brightness of the fireball, but the radiation effects.

19:39.728 --> 19:45.959
This is your showstopper story that we've just told, obviously, but I want to go back.

19:46.199 --> 19:49.384
You were born in Philadelphia during the Depression.

19:49.565 --> 19:59.041
You talked about how you all would move from place to place and change your name so the bill collectors couldn't find you during the Depression, and like so many families did at that time.

19:59.061 --> 20:05.652
And you got into journalism at a very early age, age 14, you went to work for the

20:06.188 --> 20:26.456
Philadelphia Inquirer as a copy boy, which people who, young kids that work for, that throw newspapers now don't know what a copy boy is, I understand, but you were a copy boy and you stayed there for a while and then your career went someplace else for four years and then finally 22 years at a final career.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.078
So talk about what you did real quick.

20:28.683 --> 20:34.288
Well, one correction there was I was 15 when I went to work for the newspaper.

20:34.429 --> 20:34.869
Excuse me.

20:34.889 --> 20:35.830
Don't want to get them in trouble.

20:36.030 --> 20:36.931
No, no, no.

20:38.873 --> 20:48.542
What was happening was I was in high school in the ninth grade, I think it was, and I had no interest in high school whatsoever, in school whatsoever.

20:49.123 --> 20:52.546
So I would go to the school, but I wouldn't go to the classes.

20:52.766 --> 20:57.711
And I spent three semesters without ever going to a class.

20:58.417 --> 21:05.549
And my parents didn't know about this because I intercepted all the notes coming home and we didn't have phones in the homes or cell phones or any of that stuff at the time.

21:05.569 --> 21:06.571
You were a mischievous kid.

21:06.691 --> 21:07.012
Oh, yes.

21:07.212 --> 21:08.554
I had gotten a bit of trouble now.

21:08.574 --> 21:12.821
And finally, one day I missed a note home and my father got it.

21:13.002 --> 21:14.084
And that was the end of me.

21:14.144 --> 21:17.489
And he said, look, you lazy bum, if you're not going to go to school, you're going to go to work.

21:17.509 --> 21:20.174
And he knew the sports editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer.

21:20.695 --> 21:23.259
And he took me there and said, Leo, give this kid a job.

21:23.319 --> 21:24.441
And Leo gave me a job.

21:25.096 --> 21:29.403
So I started out as a copy boy and that's, you know, a glorified gopher, right?

21:29.423 --> 21:30.745
I'm in the newspaper business.

21:30.805 --> 21:31.186
Wow.

21:31.466 --> 21:32.087
Holy mackerel.

21:33.069 --> 21:38.498
And I spent the next 14 years with the Philadelphia Inquirer.

21:38.518 --> 21:45.349
Then I left the Inquirer after it, after the union went out on strike and I decided I didn't want to stay there anymore.

21:45.903 --> 21:56.896
And I went to work for something called the Chilton Company, which publishes a lot of trade journals, Iron Age magazine, et cetera, et cetera, two of which were natural gas oriented magazines.

21:57.437 --> 21:58.899
They needed an editor.

21:59.019 --> 22:05.507
I had the qualifications from the newspaper as a writer, reporter, editor there, went to work for the magazines.

22:05.527 --> 22:06.628
Four years of that.

22:07.098 --> 22:08.883
gas industry experience.

22:08.903 --> 22:21.478
The Midwest Gas Association, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, needed a managing director, and I was hired for that job and spent the next 27 years in Minneapolis.

22:21.839 --> 22:22.521
27 years?

22:22.541 --> 22:22.862
Yes, sir.

22:23.281 --> 22:27.868
In 1993, you came to Texas and I want you to tell this story.

22:27.928 --> 22:36.622
You came to Texas by sailboat from Lake Superior to the Gulf down the Illinois and the mighty Mississippi on a sailboat.

22:37.003 --> 22:44.034
And you even wrote a book about it called We Three, Fred the Ferry Boat and Me, which is available on what they call Kindle right now.

22:44.134 --> 22:44.715
I understand.

22:44.755 --> 22:45.797
Give you your plug.

22:45.817 --> 22:46.598
Thank you.

22:47.139 --> 22:49.002
That was quite an adventure.

22:49.437 --> 22:58.972
It was an amazing trip, it really was, because Fred Ebden was the editor of one of those gas magazines that I mentioned that I worked for.

22:59.853 --> 23:07.425
And Fred went his way and I went my way, and we stayed in contact with each other and were friends for 50 years or so.

23:07.445 --> 23:14.196
But in 1993, putting it very bluntly, I ran away from home in Minnesota.

23:14.547 --> 23:22.601
and took my sailboat and headed for the Gulf of Mexico where I was going to then sail off into the sunset and come what may.

23:22.621 --> 23:32.758
But I sailed the sailboat through three of the Great Lakes, Superior, Huron and Michigan and got to Chicago, the city of Chicago.

23:33.683 --> 23:42.778
And there we had to take the mast down on the sailboat because you can't go through Chicago with 50 foot mast sticking up because they have bridges that get in your way.

23:42.798 --> 23:43.519
And that's no fun.

23:44.500 --> 23:44.620
Right.

23:44.640 --> 24:00.045
But Fred and I brought that boat down the Chicago River into the Illinois River into the Mississippi River into the Shafalaya Waterway and into the Intracoastal Canal and ended up in Freeport, Texas.

24:00.768 --> 24:06.655
Now, I knew Freeport, Texas, because I used to have a place in Galveston when I was in the working world.

24:07.376 --> 24:14.624
So every time I would come down to Galveston, I would scout out ports along the Gulf of Mexico, knowing that someday I was going to come down there in a sailboat.

24:15.605 --> 24:19.710
But we ran into a lot of trials and tribulations.

24:21.512 --> 24:22.994
We were almost killed a couple of times.

24:23.014 --> 24:28.480
We were almost run over by the tow boats plowing the rivers, and they really do plow those rivers.

24:29.152 --> 24:36.760
And the other fascinating thing about it was this was the year of 1993, the year of the big floods on the Mississippi River.

24:38.762 --> 24:47.111
Millions of acres were underwater and billions of dollars in crop and land were lost and farms ended up in the Gulf of Mexico.

24:47.131 --> 24:55.159
And what that did to the rivers was, for instance, the channels are marked by buoys and you're supposed to stay between the buoys.

24:55.460 --> 24:59.526
And in this case, the red ones are on your right and the green ones are on your left.

25:00.107 --> 25:08.019
But the turbulence of the rivers put the green ones on the right and the red ones on the left in some cases, and you didn't know where the channel was.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.801
And that got to be quite a guessing game.

25:10.863 --> 25:13.066
And my friend Fred was from Houston.

25:14.588 --> 25:16.251
We were doing this in November.

25:17.312 --> 25:24.623
And Fred froze to death every minute of the trip, being a thin-blooded, warm-blooded Texan that

25:24.907 --> 25:25.908
chill of Chicago.

25:26.730 --> 25:29.634
He never quite got over it for the entire length of the trip.

25:31.176 --> 25:32.858
We almost did get killed, as I say.

25:33.860 --> 25:44.574
We had an occasion where the current of the river took the boat almost out of our control, even though it had 130 horsepower diesel engine.

25:44.975 --> 25:49.942
That river was running at seven, eight, nine knots versus a normal three knots.

25:50.743 --> 25:53.547
So you can see it was two or three times its normal speed.

25:54.218 --> 25:59.102
And that can do strange things with a sailboat that you can hardly control.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.363
What an adventure that was.

26:00.504 --> 26:01.364
It was.

26:01.384 --> 26:04.207
Bill Harper is an author, is a writer.

26:04.327 --> 26:10.613
He has written five books, the most notable of which is this one, as a matter of fact, 11 Days in Hell.

26:11.093 --> 26:15.937
It's the story of the 1974 Carrasco prison siege at Huntsville.

26:15.957 --> 26:22.403
We've just got a couple of minutes left, but sort of talk about the genesis of how this book got written and your interest in the

26:22.383 --> 26:30.373
Of course, your own friendship with Bob Wyatt, a person who's very well respected in this community, former head of police here at Texas A&M.

26:31.034 --> 26:34.038
Sort of talk about this book in about 60 seconds that we've got.

26:34.118 --> 26:43.450
Well, Bob Wyatt was the genesis for this book for me in that he was my first interview, and he set it up for me to meet other people that were involved in this story.

26:43.470 --> 26:51.580
But where it really came from was from the Brazos Writers Group, which in the year 2000,

26:51.998 --> 27:04.382
I was president of the Brazos Writers Group, and I invited the curator of the Cushing Library on Texas A&M to come and talk to the group, tell us what they have and what they didn't have that writers would be interested in.

27:04.782 --> 27:09.091
He came and he talked about this collection of papers called the Estelle Papers.

27:09.111 --> 27:11.475
Nobody's ever looked at those papers, he said.

27:11.928 --> 27:16.313
So I thought I would do the courtesy call and go over and look at the Estelle papers.

27:16.333 --> 27:26.545
And when I started through the boxes of the files, 14 boxes of files on the Estelle papers, I suddenly came across a whole bunch of newspaper clippings about this takeover in 1974.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.651
Being an old newspaper man, I was intrigued by this story.

27:31.671 --> 27:36.096
I figured it had been written up and down several times, and I found out it never was.

27:36.464 --> 27:37.845
Only two books had been written.

27:37.885 --> 27:41.349
They were both written by hostages, and they were from the hostage viewpoint only.

27:41.669 --> 27:44.191
So I figured that story had to be told, and that book told it.

27:44.692 --> 27:47.014
It's a fascinating book, and it's a fascinating story.

27:47.034 --> 28:02.609
And you've written other books, one, An Eye for an Eye, in Defense of the Death Penalty, and a work that you're working on right now about the misjudgments of appointments of Supreme Court justices that you... The incredible Supreme Court nominations.

28:02.769 --> 28:03.670
Indeed, indeed.

28:03.802 --> 28:06.127
What a fascinating career and what a fascinating life.

28:06.347 --> 28:07.390
You're 80 years old.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.955
You act like you're 60.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.122
You look like you're 60.

28:13.443 --> 28:18.233
If I had acted like I was 60 when I was 60, I'd be better off.

28:18.635 --> 28:21.079
Thank you very much, Bill, for being our guest.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.002
Before I get off, can I say one more thing?

28:23.022 --> 28:23.503
Very quickly.

28:23.563 --> 28:24.104
Very quickly.

28:24.304 --> 28:31.736
Thank you for what you did with donating your stories from this program to the Historical Society of the Brazos Valley.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.657
It's an honor to do it.

28:32.717 --> 28:35.201
Ann Boykin is a very good friend of ours, and she does great work.

28:35.221 --> 28:36.303
Thank you for being with us.

28:36.744 --> 28:44.035
Operation Ivy was some 57 years ago, but as Bill Harper wrote himself, what he saw that day in the Marshall Islands, he'll never forget.

28:44.015 --> 28:47.660
It was the birth of a new scientific age, the hydrogen age.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.142
He wrote the devil himself.

28:49.342 --> 28:51.065
Couldn't have produced anything more fearful.

28:51.525 --> 28:53.308
What an intriguing recollection of history.

28:53.328 --> 28:55.291
And we salute Bill Harper for his service.

28:55.731 --> 28:56.612
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:56.753 --> 29:13.836
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

29:25.004 --> 29:29.158
Thank you.
