00:08.671 --> 00:26.730
Thank you.

00:37.628 --> 00:39.612
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.632 --> 00:40.634
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:41.797 --> 00:49.393
It's no secret that Texas A&M's contribution to our country's war efforts have gone above and beyond those of most other universities.

00:50.195 --> 00:55.266
We have had the honor of featuring many former students right here on Veterans of the Valley.

00:56.107 --> 01:11.400
Well, now they have a book dedicated to their service, Texas Aggies Go to War, authored by one of the foremost historians of Texas A&M, Henry C. Dethloff, professor emeritus of history at Texas A&M, along with former student John A. Adams.

01:11.420 --> 01:18.286
Texas A&M sent more than 20,000 to serve in World War II alone, more than 14,000 of those as commissioned officers.

01:18.867 --> 01:25.152
It's an extraordinary account of service, and it's an honor to have Henry Dethloff on Veterans of the Valley.

01:25.132 --> 01:27.136
Henry, it is an honor to have you here.

01:27.176 --> 01:29.180
Let's talk about the book and the project.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.907
I know this is a project that was some three and a half years in the making.

01:33.007 --> 01:36.193
Talk about the project that became Texas Aggies Go to War.

01:36.574 --> 01:36.955
All right.

01:37.315 --> 01:39.560
It started back when?

01:39.580 --> 01:45.992
I guess in 2002, and a group of former students decided that they needed to...

01:45.972 --> 01:57.734
help encourage the Corps of Cadets and help commemorate and illustrate the history of A&M's tradition of service.

01:57.754 --> 01:59.177
And it's been a remarkable tradition.

01:59.197 --> 02:04.627
But in any event, somehow or other, they got to me and asked me if I would be interested in doing that.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.272
And indeed, I was very interested.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.236
And so these are my sponsors, basically, for the project.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.819
They put it together.

02:11.859 --> 02:19.109
They have basically put themselves in the position of readers, consultants, advisors, and critics on occasion.

02:19.269 --> 02:22.174
And I think it's worked very nicely.

02:22.194 --> 02:24.917
Primarily, the individuals involved in that were C.C.

02:24.978 --> 02:33.630
Taylor, Bill Lahnquist, Jim Nelson, and Major General William A. Becker.

02:33.610 --> 02:39.596
And I think they earned a lot of credit for the product that finally came out.

02:40.136 --> 02:42.339
The story is an incredible story.

02:42.359 --> 02:44.040
I've been at Texas A&M since 1969.

02:45.782 --> 02:52.508
And I guess I've become immersed pretty much in A&M history and lore.

02:52.709 --> 02:53.730
And it's fascinating.

02:53.770 --> 03:00.276
And this war experience is indeed an incredible experience, especially when you put it together.

03:00.762 --> 03:03.447
And it started long ago.

03:03.467 --> 03:12.043
And incidentally, one of the themes that kind of ran through my mind as we worked on the book is this concept of service.

03:12.665 --> 03:20.880
And I think Aggies have portrayed and exemplified service to their country in ways that are just outstanding.

03:20.860 --> 03:33.577
President Bush, former President Bush, I think, has put sort of a stamp on that concept of service when he said a successful life, by definition, includes service to others.

03:33.758 --> 03:41.248
And a former president of the former students, Bill Yonkin, for example,

03:41.228 --> 03:53.213
put it this way, and I think that helps encapsulate the whole concept of this history of service, that Aggies have been marching off to war, offering up their service and their lives,

03:53.429 --> 04:00.559
to carry out the country's colors since our inception, and so it continues today.

04:00.579 --> 04:01.821
And indeed, it has continued.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.764
It started back in the Spanish-American War.

04:04.084 --> 04:14.359
Indeed, and I want to start there because a lot of people don't realize that Aggies have been in just about every war fought since 1898, and you can go back to the Spanish-American War.

04:14.379 --> 04:19.907
I would guess there are very few wars and very few battles in any war that Aggies have not been participants in.

04:20.187 --> 04:20.528
Indeed.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.170
And that's just remarkable.

04:22.150 --> 04:34.928
The trick with this book indeed was to compile the history of war and the individual Aggies and put them in their spot in that war and then sort of the history of A&M and so forth.

04:35.347 --> 04:42.481
and envelop it all in one big story, and I hope we did that to some degree of satisfaction.

04:42.581 --> 04:50.016
As a matter of fact, you talk about the Spanish-American War, and in your book, you're able to list some 36 Aggies who fought in the Spanish-American War.

04:50.276 --> 04:57.490
I was amazed to find when we went to, in fact, let me mention that the Texas A&M University Archives, Dr. Chapman and the

04:57.470 --> 05:05.540
library and so forth, have been tremendously supportive in this program, in this effort of research.

05:06.101 --> 05:07.623
The materials there are unbelievable.

05:07.643 --> 05:13.070
I found a scrapbook, for example, with all the pictures from the Spanish-American War in it, photographs.

05:13.871 --> 05:19.618
Milby Porter, I think, was one of the guys who was in the photograph, George McCormick.

05:19.979 --> 05:20.359
They were there.

05:20.379 --> 05:21.621
You could see these

05:21.601 --> 05:27.030
You know, they were from the local community, they were students, and they went off to war in 1898.

05:27.350 --> 05:33.801
A lot of them ended up in Camp Cuba Libra near Jacksonville, Florida.

05:33.821 --> 05:38.288
And most of those later would go into Cuba in the Army of Occupation.

05:38.829 --> 05:40.491
Others participated in the battles.

05:40.652 --> 05:43.997
We had one, unfortunately, I've never been able to find it.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.621
rough rider from the Aggies.

05:47.262 --> 05:51.167
This is mentioned in the minutes of the board of directors, never gave me a name.

05:51.488 --> 05:56.014
I've read Theodore Roosevelt's books, checked his list, can't find them.

05:56.034 --> 05:59.319
Maybe someone out there can find out who our rough rider was.

05:59.399 --> 06:00.922
We had a rough rider for sure.

06:01.082 --> 06:03.205
Obviously, there's a lot of research to be done.

06:04.006 --> 06:13.680
Then you move on to World War I. You have a list of Aggies that served in World War I. One name that sort of popped out of me, class of 09, Jesse Easterwood,

06:13.660 --> 06:16.906
of whom our airport field is named after.

06:16.926 --> 06:18.769
He was a World War I veteran.

06:18.789 --> 06:19.029
Right.

06:19.911 --> 06:21.033
Easterwood was a pilot.

06:21.053 --> 06:25.019
And there's another story that sort of astounded me and I had not been aware of.

06:25.641 --> 06:32.011
The Aggies were, I won't say obsessed, but they were excited by aviation.

06:32.031 --> 06:39.364
And I think what happened, as well as I can tell, in 1911, somebody flew into the campus in a Wright Flyer.

06:39.344 --> 06:41.409
And it just amazed everyone.

06:41.509 --> 06:44.656
And all of the Aggies wanted to be pilots from then on.

06:44.676 --> 06:48.484
Then during the war, we had sort of a pilot.

06:48.504 --> 06:51.791
This is World War I. We had a pilot training program here.

06:52.252 --> 06:59.007
We had an aviation mechanics program here, auto mechanics, meteorology, all kinds of

06:58.987 --> 07:17.400
war training programs incidentally the campus became a war training camp as well of course as those cadets from the campus going off to war in their own right we had about i believe about 2200 uh aggies in war in world war one i forget the about 1200 officers probably

07:17.380 --> 07:33.651
Some of them, I think, and indeed this is another part of the A&M story, and that is people like Edward B. Cushing, Cushing Library fame and so forth, and many others

07:33.631 --> 07:45.686
I think were particularly expert in their military efforts because they were also trained engineers, sometimes people too trained in food services, trained in agriculture.

07:45.706 --> 07:57.681
Agriculture and engineering were very important skills, academic disciplines that helped create a better officer in the modern military.

07:57.661 --> 08:18.792
I want you to expand on that because that's one thing that I found fascinating that you say that Texas A&M generally made better officers to some extent than those from the military academy because of their life skills, let's say, in engineering and agriculture, whereas the folks that came out of the military schools, West Point or

08:18.772 --> 08:20.414
were more tactical.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.998
Their focus tended to be more military.

08:23.038 --> 08:44.070
We had a strong military, of course, obviously, focus and training and program, but the greater content in the Aggie officer basically was that they were out of programs in engineering, in agriculture, science, and, of course, in all sorts of things now, computer technologies and what have you.

08:44.050 --> 08:54.558
And if you think about it, modern warfare, I suppose, draws heavily on chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering.

08:55.039 --> 08:59.832
In fact, we had some folks go off to war in France in World War I,

08:59.812 --> 09:05.280
who became experts in their tank warfare because they understood mechanical vehicles.

09:05.300 --> 09:13.792
And most people, face it, in 1914, 1918, really had very little experience in mechanical engineering, civil engineering.

09:13.832 --> 09:21.082
You built ports and docks and airfields and roads and things that are very critical in warfare.

09:21.483 --> 09:24.087
So these people knew what they were doing.

09:24.107 --> 09:25.389
They were very able officers.

09:25.569 --> 09:29.194
One pretty well-known fellow from World War II, a fellow named General George Patton,

09:29.174 --> 09:30.956
Matter of fact, he would tend to agree with you.

09:30.996 --> 09:34.401
His quote, give me an army of West Point graduates and I'll win a battle.

09:34.681 --> 09:37.565
Give me a handful of Texas Aggies and I'll win a war.

09:37.585 --> 09:38.186
He said that.

09:38.406 --> 09:40.609
And Aggies love that.

09:40.629 --> 09:41.550
I do too, of course.

09:42.772 --> 09:43.833
You'll see that printed a lot.

09:43.853 --> 09:44.474
Quite a statement.

09:44.494 --> 09:44.855
That's right.

09:44.875 --> 09:55.529
And I think that's the background for that kind of a statement, that war involves a very broad context, a very broad construction.

09:55.549 --> 09:57.932
And Aggies had that breadth and that...

09:58.267 --> 10:02.270
kind of technical experience that was very important in modern war.

10:02.331 --> 10:05.593
We focus a lot on World War II, what we call the greatest generation now.

10:05.693 --> 10:10.858
It's obviously a big focus that this generation has and very, very rightly so.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.401
And you look back at World War II and the Aggies and how they were involved in it.

10:14.901 --> 10:28.273
From your book, I see that there was a Lieutenant Roy Gillette, class of 1940, who was actually one of the few anti-aircraft resistance people at Pearl Harbor on December 7th.

10:28.253 --> 10:38.616
I think Aggies probably were every single battle of World War II, from Pearl Harbor, Corregidor, obviously, all the way through.

10:38.776 --> 10:40.440
Gillette, as I recall,

10:40.792 --> 10:43.737
When we were attacked, we weren't ready obviously at all.

10:44.338 --> 10:45.781
This was a total surprise.

10:47.624 --> 11:01.449
In fact, the ammunition was locked in a storage house and Gillette had to go break into the storage house, get the ammunition out and load it into his guns and so forth.

11:01.469 --> 11:02.310
He was one of the few

11:02.290 --> 11:07.195
anti-aircraft emplacements that was able to fire against the Japanese.

11:07.215 --> 11:09.757
I want to say they knocked down five Japanese planes.

11:09.997 --> 11:10.598
Don't quote me.

11:11.659 --> 11:22.910
You mentioned Corregidor, and in your book you also tie that in with Bataan, and you list some 88 Aggies, most of them in classes between 1930 and 1940, who actually fought.

11:22.970 --> 11:27.414
Many of those died in those two arenas of Corregidor and Bataan.

11:27.434 --> 11:28.095
Talk about that.

11:28.075 --> 11:34.519
Well, that was a rough start obviously for the United States and for Texas A&M in particular.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.630
General George F. Moore, Colonel Moore then,

11:37.981 --> 11:46.570
had been ordered to Corregidor in 1940 in preparation, if you will, for the impending dangers that seem to be developing around the world.

11:47.251 --> 11:57.942
And Moore had been commandant of cadets at Texas A&M and decided it would be good to issue orders to his new graduating officers to come to Corregidor with him.

11:57.982 --> 12:06.211
And so I think 25 from the class of 40, I believe it was, don't quote me on that either, came with Moore to Corregidor.

12:06.271 --> 12:07.212
They were all there.

12:07.546 --> 12:11.216
when Corregidor was attacked by the Japanese in 1941.

12:14.084 --> 12:17.072
So it was no coincidence that they happened to be at Corregidor.

12:17.132 --> 12:20.982
When MacArthur left, when the attack came and MacArthur

12:21.367 --> 12:25.613
got out to do greater, grander things on another day.

12:26.755 --> 12:30.761
His word was to more, was to hold Corregidor till I return.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.345
They held it as long as they possibly could.

12:33.365 --> 12:39.093
They held it to the very last man, of course, and eventually were forced to surrender.

12:39.654 --> 12:41.637
And many of those, and also...

12:41.617 --> 12:55.095
folks on the Bataan Peninsula, including a lot of Aggies, were captured and many were in that death march that took them to the Kamana Tower prison camp and so forth.

12:55.156 --> 12:55.796
Many died.

12:55.837 --> 13:01.464
It was a horrendous experience to start the war, but Aggies were there.

13:01.624 --> 13:07.152
I want to get to some photographs because I don't want to miss them because there's some photographs from the book, as a matter of fact, that we do have

13:07.132 --> 13:10.377
for you, the book, of course, Texas Aggies Go to War.

13:10.477 --> 13:16.046
So we're going to put those up on the screen here one at a time and get you to talk about them.

13:16.106 --> 13:19.411
First picture is actually there's the cover of the book, Texas Aggies Go to War.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.515
Talk a little bit about the cover.

13:21.835 --> 13:28.185
Well, the cover shows General Rudder and his folks, the Rangers.

13:28.345 --> 13:30.709
Rudder's Rangers at Pointe du Hoc.

13:30.689 --> 13:39.581
at in France and below that is that a photograph from the group who went to Camp Cuber-Liber and Milby Porter.

13:39.942 --> 13:41.504
I think it comes from Milby Porter.

13:41.984 --> 13:42.886
Yeah, it's in the top right.

13:42.906 --> 13:47.152
If you get a bigger look at that book, you'll see, yeah, that's a magnifying glass.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.554
You can find him there.

13:48.574 --> 13:56.224
But that sort of encapsulates, you know, the beginning and then the the heart of the A&M military experience.

13:56.660 --> 14:00.806
Henry Dethloff has written over 30 books and at least four of those have been about Texas A&M.

14:00.826 --> 14:02.228
Let's move on just quickly.

14:02.248 --> 14:07.696
There's the cover of the pictorial history, the first pictorial history that you wrote from 1876 to 1976.

14:08.137 --> 14:14.085
And then move on to the follow-up of that one, Texas A&M University.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.609
This is the one you edited, second edition.

14:17.062 --> 14:20.793
That's a very familiar book that's on a lot of coffee tables of many Aggies.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.497
Still there, I'm sure it is.

14:22.518 --> 14:25.987
Let's move on to some of the photographs actually from the book, Texas Aggies Go to War.

14:26.469 --> 14:27.371
What are we looking at there?

14:27.391 --> 14:28.133
That's a biplane.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.864
That's a, yeah, that's a biplane.

14:32.047 --> 14:35.673
Curtis JN-4, I had to not jot that down.

14:36.053 --> 14:39.458
That's probably in about 1917, 1918.

14:40.200 --> 14:52.559
And that was the standard training aircraft for the Army Air Corps, of course, during World War I. And most Aggies will have learned to fly in that.

14:52.579 --> 14:54.742
They nicknamed that Jenny, as a matter of fact.

14:55.083 --> 14:59.910
That's some kind of picture because everybody's very familiar with the academic building in the background.

15:00.228 --> 15:02.030
And there's a biplane right there in the front yard.

15:02.051 --> 15:03.553
You probably don't see much of that these days.

15:03.573 --> 15:04.093
No, you don't.

15:05.615 --> 15:06.236
Let's move on.

15:06.817 --> 15:07.738
Interesting picture here.

15:08.620 --> 15:18.032
This is an auto assembly repair plant on campus during World War I. We had all sorts of training programs.

15:18.073 --> 15:24.361
This was part of the training programs to provide training for mechanics, for aircraft mechanics, incidentally.

15:24.822 --> 15:27.185
Meteorologists were trained here.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.049
And to give you a sense that...

15:31.295 --> 16:01.234
the modern era dawning we also had people trained in horseshoeing and feeding livestock and that kind of thing so we were going from the age of mechanics and automobiles from the age of the horse and in fact most of the soldiers who were trained in world war one were horse soldiers we're going to move on to something we're going to talk about in a minute this is actual scene from the movie we've never been licked which was filled on the texas a m campus i believe in 1942

16:01.501 --> 16:11.379
Right, and that movie incident, if you haven't seen it, folks need to go see We've Never Been Licked with Robert Mitchum and Noah Berry Jr.

16:11.799 --> 16:14.083
Noah Berry, Quinn, what was his name?

16:14.144 --> 16:15.005
Richard Quine, I believe.

16:15.025 --> 16:16.768
Richard Quine, yes, Richard Quine.

16:18.030 --> 16:19.493
That's an incredible story.

16:19.844 --> 16:27.956
And it's important, not because it's Texas A&M, really, but because it's the United States of America.

16:28.416 --> 16:33.423
And it struck a very strong chord that we shall overcome, if you will.

16:33.484 --> 16:34.425
We will resist.

16:35.707 --> 16:37.629
These were very dark days in 1942.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.652
We had done nothing but go down.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.817
And the world was not looking good at all.

16:43.117 --> 16:46.442
This gave Americans a great deal of encouragement and encouragement.

16:46.422 --> 16:50.249
support and enthusiasm that they really needed at a critical time.

16:50.590 --> 16:58.765
This photograph, a fascinating photograph, the person second from the right is Major John A. Hilger, A&M class of 32.

16:59.165 --> 17:08.262
He was really first in command or second in command to Jimmy Doolittle, who is the gentleman to his right, second from the left.

17:08.242 --> 17:14.468
And they are there with Madame Chiang Kai-shek as they are being given an award.

17:14.668 --> 17:16.310
Fascinating picture there.

17:16.330 --> 17:20.434
Yeah, there were four or five Aggies, again, don't quote me, on the Doolittle Raid.

17:20.454 --> 17:22.035
I believe the book says that there were six in all.

17:22.135 --> 17:22.956
Six in all, good.

17:22.976 --> 17:26.920
Half dozen in all, including John Hilger, who was on the Doolittle Raid.

17:26.940 --> 17:29.022
Right, yes, on the Doolittle Raid.

17:29.202 --> 17:34.047
And this, of course, was an important, again, largely psychological boost.

17:34.027 --> 17:36.089
to the United States war effort.

17:36.449 --> 17:37.450
We were desperate.

17:37.490 --> 17:42.015
And this struck a chord of that we can do something.

17:42.035 --> 17:46.039
We are going to effectively resist this aggression.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.240
Right, right, right.

17:47.781 --> 17:48.642
And there we go.

17:48.762 --> 17:49.903
Now, let's look at this picture.

17:49.923 --> 17:51.625
This is a group photograph.

17:51.665 --> 17:53.787
This was a muster of sorts, was it not?

17:53.927 --> 17:54.147
Right.

17:54.167 --> 17:57.571
This is during the height of the Pacific campaign.

17:58.131 --> 18:01.975
I would guess that probably Aggies, again, participated in every major

18:01.955 --> 18:08.523
Pacific Campaign and again from Pearl Harbor on, Tarawa and Iwo Jima and what have you.

18:08.784 --> 18:10.366
This is Bougainville.

18:10.386 --> 18:15.012
And it's right after the close of the major battle of Bougainville.

18:15.452 --> 18:19.698
And this is muster, the Bougainville muster in April 21st, 1944.

18:20.239 --> 18:25.245
And these are soldiers who are there and have just been fighting.

18:25.748 --> 18:28.117
Pretty amazing, a muster in Bougainville.

18:28.137 --> 18:29.041
Okay, let's move on.

18:29.061 --> 18:31.210
I think we've got some other pictures.

18:31.230 --> 18:33.258
This is on campus, of course, very familiar.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.607
The figure of the ward, general informant.

18:36.127 --> 18:38.230
future president at that time, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.011
Dwight Eisenhower, right.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.314
These are happier times now.

18:41.374 --> 18:46.221
This is the end of the war, the victory muster, if you will, 1946.

18:47.703 --> 18:49.306
And Eisenhower is on campus.

18:49.966 --> 18:57.477
At the moment, I won't try to name all the other folks except that just this side of Eisenhower is Olenny Teague, Congressman Teague.

18:57.457 --> 18:59.782
And these were exciting times.

18:59.862 --> 19:02.748
Finally, Aggies are coming home.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.731
We're getting started again.

19:05.252 --> 19:09.080
And the world is beginning to come back to a sense of normalcy, I suppose.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.866
Looking at the background, it looks like that picture was taken at Kyle Field.

19:12.126 --> 19:13.088
Yeah, it was, right.

19:13.349 --> 19:13.649
Indeed.

19:14.331 --> 19:16.635
Let's move on to the next photograph.

19:16.675 --> 19:17.557
That's Greg Adore.

19:17.878 --> 19:18.098
Right.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.608
That Corregidor, that's a muster.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.011
This is the 45 Corregidor muster.

19:24.632 --> 19:25.833
The war is over.

19:26.895 --> 19:27.976
46, I'm sorry.

19:28.617 --> 19:36.527
The war is over, and these are folks still on Corregidor and accessible to the muster.

19:36.567 --> 19:45.278
Musters were held all over the world at the close of the war, and I think that's an attribute and distinction of Texas Aggies everywhere.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.039
What do we have here?

19:46.900 --> 19:49.063
This, I think, is the...

19:49.347 --> 19:53.717
the Berlin muster, and they were in Berlin.

19:53.797 --> 20:06.748
Incidentally, there's a story that excited me when I found out that the Texas Aggie, Mr. Kotzebue, was one of the first Aggies to make contact with the Russian armies on the Elbe River.

20:06.863 --> 20:11.412
at the close of the war, when the Russians and the American armies were closing together.

20:11.752 --> 20:17.884
And there was tremendous friendship and cordiality and excitement and celebration, of course.

20:17.944 --> 20:21.130
That, I'm afraid, disappeared shortly after that.

20:21.231 --> 20:25.058
But that was a happy moment in world history, in our history.

20:25.038 --> 20:28.425
This is an interesting picture here.

20:28.445 --> 20:33.516
I don't think we know the fellow to the right, but the fellow on the left is a former Aggie student.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.878
Herbert Mills, right?

20:34.899 --> 20:36.221
He's an Aggie class.

20:36.321 --> 20:39.147
I better not try to call his class, but he's a pilot.

20:39.809 --> 20:46.202
Aggies were very prominent in the Air Corps in World War I, very prominent, of course, in World War II.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.927
You quoted General Patton a while ago.

20:48.947 --> 20:58.664
I think he called General Opie Whalen the best damn general in the Air Force, an Aggie general.

20:58.684 --> 20:59.165
That's right.

20:59.405 --> 21:00.607
That photograph we just saw.

21:00.948 --> 21:05.977
General Shriver, of course, is Air Force general who helped us get it started in our space program.

21:06.758 --> 21:07.920
There was an awful lot going on.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.981
That picture of Mills.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.062
Mills was a class of 13.

21:10.082 --> 21:15.508
That was a World War I picture, as a matter of fact, that was taken in October of 1918, flipping back and forth.

21:16.329 --> 21:16.669
Keep going.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.652
I think we've got another picture.

21:19.312 --> 21:26.160
This is Charles de Gaulle, French President Charles de Gaulle, awarding to James Earl Rudder.

21:26.180 --> 21:26.901
Right.

21:28.322 --> 21:36.591
Rudder, of course, was a hero of the French and a hero of the Americans, one of the first men ashore at Pointe d'Hole, the Allied invasion.

21:36.925 --> 21:48.101
And this was the beginning of the American push against the Germans, of course, back into Germany and the mark, the beginning of the end of the war.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.664
I think it was a significant moment.

21:50.385 --> 21:53.409
And this is a classic photograph.

21:53.870 --> 21:57.475
Mr. Rudder, of course, after the war, becomes president at Texas A&M.

21:57.856 --> 22:00.319
This photograph probably fascinates me more than any.

22:00.359 --> 22:01.541
It looks like just a group of men.

22:01.561 --> 22:05.667
But this is the class of 1941 who all...

22:06.220 --> 22:07.823
went off to war as a group.

22:07.843 --> 22:08.104
Right.

22:08.505 --> 22:13.815
The class of 41 entered the military service together, were sworn into service.

22:14.657 --> 22:27.823
One of my sponsors, incidentally, and I can't, I'd have to get up and try to find him, but he's in probably the third rank there, and that's General William A. Becker, who was prominently involved in Korea, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and so forth.

22:27.803 --> 22:34.393
and has been a very helpful member of the review and writing team, I would say.

22:34.653 --> 22:38.840
A lot of those Aggies that you see in that picture, 1941, were lost in that war.

22:38.860 --> 22:39.701
I love this picture.

22:39.761 --> 22:43.206
This is back here at home at Texas A&M.

22:43.487 --> 22:47.753
This was a march to Bryan as a celebration, right?

22:47.733 --> 22:48.374
You bet.

22:48.694 --> 22:49.856
We're going back to another war now.

22:49.876 --> 22:50.537
We're flipping back.

22:50.557 --> 22:54.983
We're going back to another war because this is after World War I. This is World War I. This is the celebration of Armistice Day.

22:55.003 --> 22:57.947
Armistice Day, November the 11th, 1918.

22:59.209 --> 23:00.271
And we're marching to Brian.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.093
I want folks to look at that picture.

23:02.113 --> 23:03.155
You know, where are the homes?

23:03.235 --> 23:04.296
Where are the subdivisions?

23:04.356 --> 23:05.438
Where are the trees?

23:05.620 --> 23:07.724
That was a long march to Bryan.

23:07.784 --> 23:11.310
I wonder if that's what's Welburn Avenue right now.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.873
Well, it probably would be.

23:12.893 --> 23:16.319
It probably would be the most direct route to Bryan.

23:16.339 --> 23:18.944
And I believe that they just sort of struck classes that day.

23:18.984 --> 23:21.168
They decided that they weren't going to go to class that day.

23:21.268 --> 23:22.210
This was a revolt.

23:22.290 --> 23:23.312
This was a revolt.

23:23.332 --> 23:26.638
They were going to march to Bryan in celebration.

23:26.718 --> 23:26.939
Right.

23:26.959 --> 23:27.780
In celebration.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.202
I'm not, I've lost count.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.586
I'm not sure if we have any more photographs or not, and I guess we don't.

23:32.646 --> 23:33.027
That's it.

23:33.047 --> 23:35.049
But what a fascinating book.

23:36.632 --> 23:40.757
This book, this project though, is actually just the beginning.

23:40.817 --> 23:44.001
It's just one element of what's really a larger project.

23:44.021 --> 23:50.089
I want you to talk about that because we're going to talk about a documentary, also things on databases, on the internet,

23:50.069 --> 23:52.673
There's a lot involved with what this book represents.

23:52.793 --> 23:58.922
When we started putting this together, one of the big problems, of course, is getting all the resources, doing the research.

23:59.542 --> 24:03.909
And so the Association of Former Students had tremendous files.

24:04.249 --> 24:10.558
Most of those now we have transferred over to the archives for safekeeping and for future research.

24:10.538 --> 24:17.931
Jerry Cooper, incidentally, who was the former Texas Aggie editor, was very helpful in this effort.

24:18.012 --> 24:21.077
Joan Tatchee has been particularly the former students.

24:21.117 --> 24:23.121
Everybody has been very, very supportive.

24:23.562 --> 24:27.028
But getting the resources has been an important part of the work.

24:27.008 --> 24:41.912
And so in that effort, one thing we've done is tried to promote the archival program and encourage people, incidentally, to send their memoirs and materials to the Texas A&M University archives.

24:41.932 --> 24:48.984
Dr. David Chapman, who also has been a big supporter and collaborator, let's say, in this project.

24:49.765 --> 24:54.012
As a matter of fact, there's a website, as a matter of fact, that I believe that we can

24:53.992 --> 24:56.078
put up on the screen here in a moment.

24:56.098 --> 25:04.159
I would encourage people if they are interested in this to go to the Aggies and War website.

25:04.259 --> 25:09.874
We developed this in conjunction with the research because the idea is to encourage people to

25:09.854 --> 25:38.781
Send in their their information then I could go to that or we could go John and I could go to that and and find information that may have been overlooked in files and there's a lot overlooked of course that's I don't know how many errors in the book but the biggest error is of course the error of omission my guess is that are probably some 50,000 former students have served in military and we have a precious few of those that represented in this book but

25:38.761 --> 25:41.383
The record needs to be kept.

25:41.483 --> 26:07.907
One thing we're doing now as a sequel and as part of this effort is to take these names, this directory, this Aggies in War electronic directory and hopefully print, do a published version of those who served, the listings basically of former students who've been in military service and served prominently in combat.

26:07.887 --> 26:16.159
There's an opportunity for people to tell their stories, to give their names, and if not the individual, to do it for your parents and grandparents and so forth.

26:16.319 --> 26:22.187
And certainly a part of history that needs to be revived and kept forever.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.654
Another component that we're working on now, too, is to do a film documentary.

26:27.094 --> 26:28.597
That'll be an incredible story.

26:28.657 --> 26:33.504
The problem of putting that together is awesome, but I think it can be done.

26:33.524 --> 26:36.628
And in fact, some folks I've talked to have said, well, you need...

26:36.997 --> 26:46.234
eight or 10 hours of documentary on this kind of thing, hopefully we can start it off with a 30 or 45 minute or several hour kind of presentation.

26:46.254 --> 26:48.077
The story's gonna be an incredible story.

26:50.181 --> 26:55.410
So there's been a lot, we've done some journal, John and I did some journal articles for the Texas Aggie

26:55.390 --> 27:07.285
help hopefully, you know, encourage people to become interested and to participate in producing information about the military service of former students at Texas A&M.

27:07.365 --> 27:08.807
I want to mention John Adams again.

27:08.867 --> 27:10.088
He helped you in this book.

27:10.148 --> 27:20.301
He's done a couple of books himself on the Corps of Cadets, but he just recently left us and moved to Florida where he's a development director for sort of the statewide chamber down

27:20.281 --> 27:21.963
Yes, Enterprise Florida.

27:22.083 --> 27:35.939
John had been in Laredo with the Laredo Development Foundation now, and I think Governor Bush in Florida hired him to take on this job, and it's, I think, a great job, and John's going to do a great job of that work, too.

27:36.339 --> 27:37.100
Indeed, indeed.

27:37.220 --> 27:42.947
I also want to mention that former President Bush wrote the foreword for your book also, something you're very proud of.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.269
You bet.

27:44.309 --> 27:47.314
That has been a tremendous thing.

27:47.334 --> 27:53.064
And Mr. Bush, I think, really, again, put his finger on the idea of service.

27:53.324 --> 27:54.426
Service is important.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.572
Aggies have served and they've served well.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.034
And this is part of that story.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.436
And you serve in many capacities.

28:00.537 --> 28:01.098
Indeed they have.

28:01.158 --> 28:01.779
We're out of time.

28:01.839 --> 28:05.825
I wish we could go another hour and talk about the book, Texas Aggies Go to War.

28:05.886 --> 28:07.348
Thank you, Henry Dethloff.

28:07.328 --> 28:29.640

28:29.620 --> 28:35.805
Thanks to Henry Deathlove, and thanks to all veterans for their service, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

28:35.825 --> 28:36.686
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:36.706 --> 28:59.425
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

29:01.295 --> 29:03.407
Bye.
