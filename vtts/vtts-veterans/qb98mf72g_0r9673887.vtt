00:15.286 --> 00:39.492
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.592 --> 00:40.753
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:41.560 --> 00:47.880
Many who served bravely in Vietnam were there for a year, and if they were among the fortunate to come home, they went about their lives.

00:48.442 --> 00:53.899
Well, Jim Hester of Bryan was an Army lifer, interrupted by four years that he spent in the Air Force.

00:54.301 --> 01:03.495
And speaking of numbers, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hester served one tour in Germany, then took three tours of Vietnam, served in the Army and the Air Force, was a medic, was a nurse.

01:04.116 --> 01:11.267
He was wounded three times and earned two Purple Hearts, one Silver Star, one Bronze Star, one Army Combination Medal for Valor.

01:11.287 --> 01:18.217
He retired twice, the second time after 9-11 when he up-trained troops to serve in the War on Terror.

01:18.237 --> 01:20.601
His 35 years of service, truly remarkable.

01:20.621 --> 01:23.245
What an honor it is to have you here, Lieutenant Colonel Hester.

01:23.545 --> 01:30.294
You grew up in Corpus Christi, which everybody knows is a Navy town, but you kind of got hooked on tanks and went off to Germany.

01:30.314 --> 01:35.801
Talk about quickly the years before you went to Vietnam and sort of how you prepared for that.

01:35.821 --> 01:39.025
Well, I was in the Cuban crisis.

01:39.045 --> 01:46.475
I was in junior high, and one day all these armored vehicles started coming down the pavement, going out to Padre Island.

01:46.495 --> 01:51.662
And that's the first time I'd really ever seen any military vehicles up close other than Navy.

01:52.435 --> 01:57.700
When they came back after it stood down, Cuban crisis did, we took a tour.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.523
They stopped and let us play on the tanks, and then I was hooked.

02:01.543 --> 02:07.348
And so when I got out of school in 1965, you either were drafted or you joined.

02:08.249 --> 02:16.136
My stepfather had been a sergeant in Patton's Army during World War II, and so he kind of steered me into the Army.

02:16.156 --> 02:21.801
My father was actually a Marine, but I decided I didn't want to float on boats, so I kind of went the Army way.

02:22.996 --> 02:31.367
And then Vietnam in what, 66, 67, I guess was the first time that you were in country for a shorter tour.

02:31.407 --> 02:32.649
Talk about that and why you were there.

02:33.310 --> 02:43.863
I had finished my medical training, medic training in the latter part of 66 and was assigned back to Fort Knox in a overhaul and repair maintenance battalion.

02:44.324 --> 02:48.109
They were the ones that converted all the tanks and so forth and major repairs.

02:48.562 --> 02:51.926
We went on a TDY or temporary tour over to Vietnam.

02:51.966 --> 02:55.110
So at that time, armor was really influxing the country.

02:55.711 --> 03:01.939
And they were having some problems with the diesel engines in the tanks due to the weather, dust, and so forth.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.843
And they were going to convert them back into gasoline engines.

03:05.564 --> 03:16.037
And so being one of the medics in the battalion, I went over with this task force over to ready the tanks or convert them, whatever they needed to do with them.

03:16.962 --> 03:20.969
which lasted, we left in February and got back about June of 1967.

03:21.670 --> 03:26.158
Now you were assigned, you were 11th Armored Cav.

03:26.198 --> 03:26.979
Describe that unit.

03:27.220 --> 03:34.612
Well, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, or Black Horse, had actually, I knew them when they were in Fuldegap in Germany in 65.

03:34.693 --> 03:39.561
They, I think, transitioned over to Vietnam around 1966, somewhere in there.

03:40.317 --> 03:47.524
By hook or crook, when we went into the maintenance depot, they were the first ones that were going to be receiving the upgrade on the tanks.

03:47.544 --> 04:02.760
And so when we got out to Black Horse, 11th Cav, which was in a place called Swanlock, about 60 clicks or so from Saigon, that's where I got actually my first introduction to Black Horse, or the 11th Army Cavalry Regiment.

04:03.241 --> 04:04.682
Indeed.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.945
Let's fast forward here because you did so much in Vietnam.

04:08.046 --> 04:09.447
You were a medic.

04:09.781 --> 04:17.530
But that involved a little bit of everything from typing to clerking, to driving Jeeps, to actually being a medic also.

04:17.650 --> 04:19.512
You were pretty much a jack of all trades.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.275
Well, in those days, you kind of had more than one hat.

04:22.395 --> 04:27.681
I was one of the only two people in the company that, or battalion actually, that could type other than the company clerk.

04:28.542 --> 04:31.626
And we put band-aids on and fixed the alleys.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.229
And we also, I was a training NCO.

04:34.629 --> 04:37.813
We taught them how to make sure they were

04:38.418 --> 04:44.927
eligible to take care of the equipment on the tanks and what we had and kind of get them indoctrinated to the country and what they were getting into.

04:45.548 --> 04:48.092
Started your second tour of Vietnam, I believe in January of 68.

04:48.212 --> 04:50.375
The Tet Offensive started soon after that.

04:51.116 --> 04:56.223
Third Squadron M Company and you had a somewhat of a famous name for your brigade commander.

04:56.984 --> 05:01.050
Well, our brigade commander was Colonel George Patton Jr.

05:01.130 --> 05:06.197
He came in about midway on my tour there and he was

05:06.464 --> 05:08.588
was quite an individual, very gun-ho.

05:10.210 --> 05:16.701
He was a no-nonsense commander, and he wanted to make sure that everybody got what was coming to him, and he took care of business.

05:16.721 --> 05:16.861
Indeed.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.465
He was somewhat flamboyant like his dad, right?

05:19.485 --> 05:19.826
Yes, sir.

05:19.866 --> 05:20.928
He was a little flamboyant.

05:20.948 --> 05:21.349
He was.

05:21.689 --> 05:26.197
He did his thing, but everybody knew who he was, and everybody respected him.

05:26.217 --> 05:27.619
11th Cav was a pretty famous group.

05:27.639 --> 05:29.502
The Viet Cong didn't think much of them.

05:29.482 --> 05:29.963
No, sir.

05:31.345 --> 05:38.277
During Tet, the 11th Cav, when they got in there, they actually were running Saigon, the Cambodian border up in there.

05:38.297 --> 05:46.971
And when they encountered the Viet Cong, actually they were very triumphant, and they found them being what they call fierce fighters.

05:47.753 --> 05:55.185
And for several months, even after I got there, the Viet Cong would actually go out of its way to keep from encountering the Black Horse because they were afraid of them.

05:57.157 --> 06:03.467
Talk about, I remember you told me a story about some games that you played with the Viet Cong using the radio networks.

06:04.329 --> 06:11.440
Yeah, on the radio, every morning at 6 o'clock, I think a lot of people have probably seen Good Morning Vietnam, where they come on and they say, Good Morning Vietnam.

06:12.322 --> 06:22.438
And 6 o'clock in the morning when it would come on, by hook or crook, someone would set up with Armed Forces Radio that if they would play Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide,

06:23.144 --> 06:28.503
at 6 o'clock, then the Viet Cong knew they were in real trouble because the black horse was coming to get them.

06:28.523 --> 06:30.570
And so it made our day a lot easier.

06:30.590 --> 06:34.504
And so when they heard that and they knew the black horse was in the area, they pretty much stayed clear of us.

06:35.345 --> 06:38.729
Lieutenant Colonel Hester has so many stories from his tours of Vietnam.

06:38.769 --> 06:47.079
The one I want you to talk about now involves meeting up with an actually North Vietnamese Army troop, and it also involved a pallet of beer.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.041
Tell that story.

06:48.801 --> 06:54.168
Well, one of the things that Colonel Patton did for us, he made sure we got a hot meal in the afternoon for the most part.

06:54.188 --> 06:59.074
And we got a pallet of beer a week, and it would fly out wherever we were at, and we'd get us a pallet of beer.

06:59.830 --> 07:06.541
And this particular morning, we had come in the night before and had bivouacked in a dry rice paddy.

07:06.561 --> 07:11.569
And over to our, approximately our one o'clock was a large tree area, a forest area.

07:12.510 --> 07:14.553
And we really didn't have time to recon.

07:14.573 --> 07:26.412
We set up and the next morning, a Air Force bird dog or scout plane flew over and radioed us that he had seen some activity down in that forest area and made us aware of it.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.954
We were going to go out and recon, see what we could find.

07:30.435 --> 07:35.845
And just as we were leaving, a helicopter come flying in with an iron pallet of air.

07:37.008 --> 07:45.885
And so as they came fairly close and began to lure it, to drop it, the North Vietnamese regular army, not Viet Cong, came out of this forest area.

07:46.321 --> 07:49.605
I don't know if they thought it was food or rationing or whatever.

07:49.625 --> 07:50.146
Supplies of some sort.

07:50.166 --> 07:50.646
Supplies.

07:51.067 --> 07:54.010
They came out to get it and we weren't going to have any part of it.

07:54.051 --> 07:55.773
They weren't going to take our beer and we didn't want that.

07:56.193 --> 07:58.316
Unfortunately, they got on the short end of the stick, they did.

07:58.336 --> 07:59.377
Right, right.

07:59.397 --> 08:00.559
And the battle ensued, right?

08:00.619 --> 08:01.279
Battle ensued.

08:01.720 --> 08:10.230
And when it did, they had some RPG teams or rocket propel teams, small arm fire, some mortars.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.915
And so as they came out to meet us, of course, we went in to meet them.

08:14.772 --> 08:26.104
and the tank commander that I was next to, he got hurt, and he left the tank, and I took his place.

08:26.124 --> 08:33.292
Now, the tank commander sits on top of the tank in the cupola, and he's kind of the one that controls who does what and who they shoot at and so forth.

08:34.213 --> 08:39.458
The tank immediately to the left of me took a couple RPG rounds and kind of burst into flames.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.783
What I did is, and the ground forces were coming towards us,

08:44.388 --> 08:46.653
I maneuvered my tank around into the front of it.

08:47.314 --> 08:55.170
We got off, and we took these wounded soldiers off that burning tank and got them off the back so that somebody could take care of them.

08:55.250 --> 09:01.002
I immediately got back on my vehicle, which by then had also taken some RPG rounds.

09:01.022 --> 09:03.747
My gunner and driver were injured, and I...

09:04.165 --> 09:16.403
pulled them from the turret and got them on the back and then I mounted the cupolo, the turret and opened 50 caliber fire on my coax or 7.62 machine gun was disabled.

09:17.244 --> 09:23.593
When I emptied the 50 caliber, I dismounted, picked up a couple of M16s and had a ground effect.

09:24.715 --> 09:26.397
And for this, you were awarded the Silver Star.

09:27.038 --> 09:28.240
This was August 5th, 1968.

09:28.380 --> 09:32.806
I'd like to, Lieutenant Colonel Hester has described it.

09:33.007 --> 09:33.868
I'd like to,

09:34.270 --> 09:38.757
Read how it's described in the actual commendation, General Order Number 1468.

09:39.397 --> 09:46.568
Specialist Hester mounted the burning tank, entered the turret, and pulled the injured gunner to safety and administered first aid.

09:47.469 --> 09:57.544
With complete disregard for his own safety, Specialist Hester remounted the burning tank and, using the .50 caliber machine gun, directed fire toward oncoming Viet Cong infantrymen.

09:58.604 --> 10:09.340
Specialist Hester upon exhausting the 50 caliber ammunition dismounted the burning vehicle and took up an M16 and directed small arms fire toward the Viet Cong until reinforcements could arrive.

10:09.360 --> 10:15.229
Specialist Hester was officially credited with 21 Viet Cong killed, 16 Viet Cong wounded.

10:15.249 --> 10:17.693
Specialist Hester's display of courage and determination

10:18.010 --> 10:25.919
was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself and the United States Army."

10:26.740 --> 10:36.891
This is something when you receive this, and of course, the star, which we'll see in a minute, is something that obviously you're very proud of the way that you reacted under a very, very critical situation.

10:36.951 --> 10:37.591
I am.

10:37.611 --> 10:38.372
Indeed, N.R.

10:38.953 --> 10:42.116
And to hear it again, I can tell that it still comes back to you.

10:43.778 --> 10:45.520
Let's move on.

10:47.153 --> 11:00.360
But I do want you to describe, because it was very interesting going back to sort of this fight, there was a big difference between Viet Cong and regular North Vietnamese Army in the way they fought and the sophistication of how they fought.

11:00.481 --> 11:06.934
Oh, the North Vietnamese regular army were actual hardcore professional soldiers, just like America, British, or whoever.

11:07.420 --> 11:17.901
A lot of them were Russian or Chinese trained and they had the better weapons and they had the tactics and they had the command system.

11:18.282 --> 11:23.573
And so they had NCOs that could actually function and lead troops.

11:24.076 --> 11:28.821
Well, the Viet Cong, although they were effective in what they did, to me they were more like a militia.

11:28.841 --> 11:42.597
They were bands of roaming soldiers or militiamen who would come in and once they ensued into a firefight, a lot of times they would just burst and run because they really did not have a true command structure, at least what I dealt with anyway.

11:42.617 --> 11:49.965
So when you encountered a North Vietnamese regular, whether they were a squad, platoon or battalion, you had professional soldiers.

11:51.025 --> 11:58.415
You were, I guess, officially wounded three times, really officially wounded twice, for which you earned two Purple Hearts.

11:59.356 --> 11:59.937
Go through those.

11:59.997 --> 12:06.545
Talk about your... When we got to Vietnam in 68, we landed at Cameron Bay.

12:06.565 --> 12:09.870
And by hook or crook, we got on the wrong airplane and ended up in Way.

12:10.891 --> 12:20.003
Well, while they were trying to decide what to do with us in this replacement center, on January 31st, we were coming back from the NCO club.

12:20.287 --> 12:23.552
And the Tet Offensive started.

12:23.572 --> 12:27.797
And our Repo Depot was right at the end of a mountain or cliff.

12:27.858 --> 12:35.088
And on top of the mountain was a radio station or antenna, which apparently was of some strategic value to everybody.

12:35.108 --> 12:39.353
And the Viet Cong began to lob off mortars, hand grenades, small arm fire.

12:39.373 --> 12:46.243
They had infiltrated in the way into the barracks from setting satchel charges and put the fuel dumps to fire and so forth.

12:46.966 --> 12:55.458
And as we were scurrying around trying to decide where we could get a weapon of some sort, apparently I was hit in the chest by a bullet.

12:55.478 --> 12:59.704
Apparently it come from a long way because it really didn't go that deep.

12:59.724 --> 13:08.457
And so the next morning when things were a little bit more organized, someone had pointed out to me that I had blood all over my shirt.

13:09.178 --> 13:11.681
So we went down the road to an aid station.

13:11.701 --> 13:16.568
And when I walked in, there was this crusty old army major that I said, I think I've been

13:17.138 --> 13:18.880
hurt major, and she said, well, let me see.

13:19.001 --> 13:26.291
And she looks up at my chest and she reaches in there with her fingers and pulls this bullet out and gives it to me and throws a bandaid on me and says, get out of my aid station.

13:26.311 --> 13:27.192
You're not hurt, soldier.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.795
So I missed out on that one.

13:28.815 --> 13:31.018
I didn't get my reward for that.

13:31.138 --> 13:32.500
She didn't want to mess around with the paperwork.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.527
No, I was not really hurt, according to her, and I probably wasn't.

13:38.182 --> 13:42.767
Your one Purple Heart that you earned in particular, you got pretty bunged up.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.970
It was an exploding gas tank.

13:45.010 --> 13:59.606
Well, actually the first one was we were in base camp and I had gone back to, we had some new recruits that came in and I was in base camp and it was raining that night and lights were out at 2200.

13:59.867 --> 14:07.395
And so I was in the orderly room and I had just laid down and I heard off in the distance a thud.

14:08.624 --> 14:11.768
And I waited and I heard it hit on the other end of the base camp.

14:12.248 --> 14:20.357
So I immediately got up and ran out and started getting all of these young guys up that you really didn't know what was going on into a bunker.

14:20.377 --> 14:22.560
And so that they'd be better protected.

14:22.580 --> 14:27.606
And as I did, a 122 millimeter rocket exploded in the trees above us.

14:27.626 --> 14:30.289
I got hit in the back shrapnel, knocked to the ground.

14:31.410 --> 14:36.015
When I recovered my senses, I got up and made sure all those guys were safe.

14:36.736 --> 14:38.378
And when I got to the bunker,

14:38.662 --> 14:41.025
which overlooked the berm.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.367
One of the soldiers had been hurt.

14:42.868 --> 14:45.412
He had been outside when it started.

14:45.752 --> 14:57.750
I put him in a jeep and drove him up about 25 or 30 yards to the aid station and we did a little patchwork on him and I went back to the bunker and by then the new recruits had

14:58.220 --> 15:04.406
had come to the bunker and so we set up guard all night long in the bunker just in case there was a ground attack.

15:05.067 --> 15:14.296
And the next morning I went up to the aid station and had them put some bandages on where my shrapnel wounds had been and I got my first Purple Heart.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.819
The second one though was a little more serious.

15:16.839 --> 15:27.349
Right, after this encounter where the Silver Star was one, about two or three weeks after that, we were on a road march and we had stopped.

15:27.785 --> 15:31.189
They had command detonated mines.

15:31.209 --> 15:35.154
They would usually take out the first vehicle, the middle one, and then the last one.

15:35.174 --> 15:37.457
And on these roads, you really didn't have a lot of room to maneuver.

15:37.977 --> 15:52.195
Unfortunately, I happened to be one of the two in the middle, and we were standing outside, and one of them, the tank in front of us, or actually between us, was a bomb that exploded as a booby trap.

15:52.755 --> 15:56.560
And when it did, the gasoline engines caught on fire, the gasoline, and I was blown up.

15:57.586 --> 16:03.152
And I spent several months in Japan in one of the hospitals over there for that.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.595
What were your injuries?

16:05.916 --> 16:10.020
I actually had an eardrum that was blown out.

16:12.123 --> 16:13.525
Both of my femurs were fractured.

16:13.545 --> 16:15.887
My arm was dislocated.

16:15.907 --> 16:18.831
My eye had actually been slightly evolved from its socket.

16:18.851 --> 16:21.774
I had a broken jaw in a couple of three places.

16:21.794 --> 16:26.039
And I think I also had an ankle that was broken.

16:26.059 --> 16:26.800
My goodness.

16:26.881 --> 16:35.781
We're going to go back to more of this story in a minute, but I want to take a look at some of the photographs that Lieutenant Colonel Hester has supplied to us, and we can go to the first one.

16:36.723 --> 16:37.585
There you are right there.

16:37.645 --> 16:41.353
That's the young and impressionable young Jimmy Hester.

16:41.373 --> 16:42.797
That was basic training in Fort Polk.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.683
Had no idea maybe what you were in for.

16:48.177 --> 16:48.617
There you are.

16:48.677 --> 16:49.418
Good looking young man.

16:49.638 --> 16:51.700
We're going to fast forward quite a bit with the pictures here.

16:51.740 --> 16:57.425
As a matter of fact, they're not in a particular special order, but this is you and your wife, Jenny.

16:57.526 --> 16:59.007
We'll go to this one.

16:59.027 --> 16:59.367
There you go.

16:59.387 --> 17:00.228
When was that picture taken?

17:00.248 --> 17:02.290
It was taken in 2001 in December.

17:02.350 --> 17:05.092
We had a Christmas ball at Fort Sam Houston that we were attending.

17:08.055 --> 17:08.856
You're proud of it.

17:08.876 --> 17:14.000
These pictures hang on Jenny and Jim's wall at their home and Brian.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.783
Going to move on to another photograph right here.

17:16.949 --> 17:18.572
This is, you have three sons.

17:18.592 --> 17:18.852
I do.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.656
And this is the one who chose the military path.

17:22.618 --> 17:25.162
Talk about him, what he's doing, and what he's about to do.

17:25.342 --> 17:27.065
He is a Navy chief.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.447
He's a first class E6.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.489
He is a beach master.

17:30.651 --> 17:32.093
And I'm very proud of that picture.

17:32.113 --> 17:33.615
We finally got together and had him done.

17:34.477 --> 17:37.281
And he now is in Norfolk, Virginia at Little Creek.

17:37.301 --> 17:42.349
And he is about to deploy on his third tour of Iraq in November.

17:43.713 --> 17:45.035
And he's already been to Iraq twice?

17:45.135 --> 17:45.436
Twice.

17:45.536 --> 17:46.938
And what was his job there?

17:47.299 --> 17:49.182
He's been a beach master all three times.

17:49.262 --> 17:49.843
A beach master there.

17:49.863 --> 17:50.043
Yes, sir.

17:50.063 --> 17:51.406
And a beach master does exactly what?

17:51.726 --> 17:57.416
A beach master is actually, they call them mini-seals, but what they do is they go on a beach and they secure it.

17:58.618 --> 18:04.607
And so once it's secured, then they're the ones that actually allow the equipment and men to be brought in off the ships.

18:04.647 --> 18:06.450
And they are actually traffic controllers.

18:06.470 --> 18:08.674
They decide where it's going to go, where it's going to be put.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.497
And then after that's done,

18:10.814 --> 18:25.412
then they leave because usually the Marines or whoever has secured the beach, once that's done, when they begin to come back, they reappear on the beach again, and they make sure all the equipment is loaded in whatever order, and then they're the last ones off the beach.

18:25.432 --> 18:27.415
So they secure the beach until they're off of it.

18:27.455 --> 18:29.938
So he's got a pretty hazardous job.

18:29.958 --> 18:34.223
Last thing I want to look at is your shadow box with your awards.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.423
And sort of go over these with us.

18:36.503 --> 18:39.007
I think everybody knows what this one is here.

18:39.047 --> 18:41.631
This is one of your two Purple Hearts here.

18:42.252 --> 18:44.876
And the one in the top middle, I think that's your Silver Star.

18:45.317 --> 18:46.199
Talk about these awards.

18:46.219 --> 18:47.641
Let's go top left.

18:47.661 --> 18:48.222
What are we looking at?

18:48.242 --> 18:50.305
Okay, the middle one, of course, is the Silver Star.

18:50.425 --> 18:53.390
The one to the left, the red and green, is the Bronze Star.

18:53.651 --> 18:58.178
And the one to the right is the Army Combination Medal for valor.

18:58.198 --> 19:00.582
And the one below it is the National Defense.

19:01.270 --> 19:05.755
And the other one is actually a good conduct medal, which we call the John Wayne Medal.

19:06.455 --> 19:08.938
Did you always earn that good conduct medal?

19:08.958 --> 19:09.939
Well, I did the first one.

19:09.959 --> 19:14.644
The rest of them, I'm not sure exactly how I got them, but I had two or three of those before it was over with.

19:15.124 --> 19:18.908
And then the one to the right, the purple one, is, of course, the Purple Heart, one of them.

19:19.268 --> 19:21.831
Right.

19:21.851 --> 19:28.037
And the two down below it, the green and white, is the Vietnam campaign in-service, in-country ribbon.

19:28.304 --> 19:33.993
And then the one to the left, the yellow and green, is the actual Vietnam service medal.

19:34.013 --> 19:37.618
Certainly all symbols of bravery that all soldiers are proud to wear.

19:37.638 --> 19:39.541
And I know that you're very proud of these.

19:39.902 --> 19:50.278
You also might notice in the shot of Lieutenant Colonel Hester that we're using today back behind him is his uniform from Vietnam and a rack of ribbons there.

19:50.528 --> 20:06.850
You were certainly decorated, but I know that that's probably not singly the thing that's most important to you, but just the memory of your service and what you were able to accomplish and all of your comrades were able to accomplish in that war that still to this day is not an understood war.

20:07.302 --> 20:07.703
It's true.

20:08.023 --> 20:08.824
It never has been.

20:08.844 --> 20:10.486
It probably never will be.

20:11.107 --> 20:13.831
But those of us that were there, we did what we had to do.

20:14.171 --> 20:20.459
And when we did, some came back and it was something they would prefer not to have, which I don't think really of us wanted to be over there.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.282
But when you go in, that's your duty.

20:22.302 --> 20:24.184
That's what you get paid for and that's your job.

20:24.204 --> 20:27.308
And I was a professional and that's what was my job.

20:28.029 --> 20:31.294
Summer of 1968, you finished your permanent tour.

20:31.494 --> 20:32.415
But then...

20:32.918 --> 20:42.028
It's sort of a second segment of your military life begins then because you get interested in becoming a nurse.

20:42.649 --> 20:44.811
Talk a little bit about how that all evolved.

20:45.051 --> 20:52.920
Right before I got injured, the orderly room clerk came up one day and says, hey, you know, the Army's looking for nurses.

20:52.940 --> 20:53.641
They want medics.

20:53.661 --> 20:54.862
They want to send them to nursing school.

20:54.902 --> 20:56.003
Why don't you go ahead and apply?

20:56.063 --> 20:59.887
You know, you stay nice and warm and clean and you don't have to put up with this.

20:59.907 --> 21:00.428
So I did.

21:01.150 --> 21:06.236
And as it usually goes, you'll put in for something and it'll never happen or they give you the opposite.

21:06.677 --> 21:13.085
Well, after I was hurt, sent to Japan, I came back to Fort Sam Houston for convalescent leave.

21:13.105 --> 21:18.492
And my actual enlistment was about to be up in about six months.

21:18.512 --> 21:25.040
And so this recruiter came up to him and says, Hester, you know, he says, I've got a piece of paper here that says you apply to go to nursing school.

21:25.060 --> 21:25.941
And I said, that's right.

21:25.981 --> 21:26.922
He says, well, you know,

21:27.239 --> 21:30.424
you're going to have to go before a medical board, and you might not be able to stay in the Army.

21:30.444 --> 21:31.365
He said, but I'll tell you what.

21:31.806 --> 21:40.418
He said, if you'll sign on this dotted line, he says, I'll get credit for your recruitment, and we'll get you in nursing school, and you can worry about that board later.

21:40.438 --> 21:43.803
I thought, fine, because I wanted to stay in, and so I did.

21:44.504 --> 21:54.478
And so in March or April of 69, I was released to convalescent leave school in Fort Sam Houston.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.016
where I went to school in Corpus Christi.

21:57.236 --> 21:57.897
Right.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.280
And that's where I stayed for the next three years in nursing school.

22:00.860 --> 22:07.948
But then you got a little bit of a surprise a little bit later on because this test, this physical test that you were going to have to take came along a little quicker than you expected.

22:07.968 --> 22:08.108
It did.

22:08.188 --> 22:24.225
I was right into my, going into my senior year in nursing school and I got a letter from the medical board at Fort Sam and they wanted me to appear before them because somehow or another my paperwork had been slow in getting there and they wanted to make sure that I was going to be fit to continue on to school.

22:24.245 --> 22:24.786
So I went

22:25.508 --> 22:27.651
And by hook or crook, we talked about things.

22:27.671 --> 22:34.181
And they said, well, if you can pass the army physical fitness test or a physical fitness test, then we'll allow you to be retained and you can finish your school.

22:34.682 --> 22:41.813
However, I can't guarantee you that you'll be in the army nurse corps because right now we're putting these people in a military pool.

22:41.873 --> 22:43.356
And we'll talk about that a little later.

22:44.377 --> 22:50.106
And so I went back and I used to visit the NCO club, the chief's club out at the base.

22:50.587 --> 22:52.630
And I was out there one night crying in my beer and

22:52.930 --> 22:58.963
about this and an old Marine, several Marines that I had met in Vietnam came up and says, you know, what's the problem?

22:59.003 --> 23:06.379
So I tell them, you'd be out here Saturday morning with your PT clothes on and we'll get your PT test.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.682
So I did.

23:08.067 --> 23:16.083
Well, PT test considered of some volleyball, some softball, and then, of course, happy hour after it was all over with.

23:16.504 --> 23:23.117
And so my Marine Corps physical fitness test was signed by a Marine gunny and signed by a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

23:23.799 --> 23:26.344
And so when I presented this back to the board, they were in awe.

23:26.604 --> 23:29.029
They just were not sure that exactly

23:29.330 --> 23:37.807
why or how I could have passed a Marine Corps physical fitness test, which was considerably harder at that time, which probably still is in the armies.

23:37.827 --> 23:38.990
And so I got to stay in.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.092
And you got to stay in.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.235
I got to stay in.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.798
And somebody helped you along, but that was good.

23:42.818 --> 23:43.700
Absolutely, they did.

23:43.720 --> 23:49.752
Went to aerospace school, learned to be a flight nurse, went to Fort Scott for the training, and then...

23:50.288 --> 23:52.751
Pretty fascinating what you do after that.

23:52.811 --> 23:57.878
Talk about the air back situation and what you did there, other than you did a whole lot of flying.

23:58.119 --> 24:09.193
Well, once we get out of airspace school or nurse flight school at Brooke in San Antonio, we got assigned to Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, and that was the MAC, or where all the air back went.

24:09.233 --> 24:19.367
Basically, our flight went from Scott to Fort Dix or Maguire and over to Germany and then back to Guam, Japan.

24:19.803 --> 24:24.952
From Guam, they usually flew into Vietnam to pick up wounded and so forth.

24:25.593 --> 24:33.146
And, of course, we always managed to stay there at least 24 hours so that we could get our pay without any taxes.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.430
We'd fly back to Guam, then to Hawaii Tripler.

24:35.670 --> 24:40.258
And from Tripler, we'd fly into Wolford Hall in San Antonio and then back to Scott.

24:41.656 --> 24:44.780
And you'd pick up folks, you'd mend folks, you'd fix folks.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.325
This was just a constant tour of doing this kind of thing.

24:48.345 --> 24:48.465
Right.

24:48.485 --> 24:49.867
It was an air ambulance is what it was.

24:50.288 --> 24:51.850
We'd pick up the wounded.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.033
And actually, on these aircraft, we had our little ICU.

24:54.394 --> 24:55.435
We had a little emergency room.

24:55.715 --> 24:58.619
We had a lot of walking wounded that were just looking for a way back.

24:59.260 --> 25:06.410
Sometimes we would pick up people, say, for instance, who had been in Hawaii, who actually lived in California.

25:06.510 --> 25:11.477
We would fly them back there so they could be closest to home to the nearest military hospital.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.484
You went back into the Army, out of the Air Force.

25:14.504 --> 25:23.618
You spent 10 years as an instructor at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, and then 9-11, 2001 came along, and you were asked to serve again.

25:23.638 --> 25:24.379
Talk about that.

25:24.399 --> 25:38.201
Well, I retired in April 2001, and 9-11 came along, and not too many weeks after that, I get a phone call from the Army Center up in St.

25:38.221 --> 25:40.384
Louis, and they said, hey, we need

25:40.651 --> 25:45.156
We're gonna bring you back on duty, but we're gonna put you in with a reserve group in San Antonio.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.418
We got a field hospital that needs to be upgraded.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.080
And so I said, fine.

25:49.560 --> 26:02.073
And so from about October 2001 until actually May of 2003, I was one of the people in that field hospital that helped up train.

26:02.093 --> 26:08.700
And then it stood down in September of 2003

26:09.153 --> 26:13.662
and everything we had done had been packed and put by a real head, basically.

26:13.682 --> 26:18.492
And they stood down, so I retired again and decided that's about all I wanted anymore.

26:19.233 --> 26:28.832
And now, all those people that we had up-trained, many of them actually went over to our wreck and are there now in November, December, 2004.

26:29.167 --> 26:42.520
I know there's a lot more to your story, and you want to say again, Lieutenant Colonel Hester, Army Commendation Medal for Valor, Silver Star, Bronze Star, Two Purple Hearts, and today you're still in the medical field.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.521
You do a little commuting.

26:43.541 --> 26:44.863
Talk about what you're doing right now.

26:44.883 --> 26:45.703
We've got about a minute.

26:45.743 --> 26:55.393
My professional is a registered nurse, and I work at Richards Memorial Hospital in Rockdale right now, where I work in the emergency room, which is actually my forte, my specialty up there.

26:55.373 --> 26:57.876
And I commute a little bit every day, but it's a nice drive.

26:58.256 --> 27:01.719
And it's a nice little hospital.

27:01.739 --> 27:03.401
And I enjoy what I do there.

27:03.822 --> 27:07.445
And so that's basically what I do right now.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.307
It's a remarkable, remarkable story.

27:09.327 --> 27:10.388
And we could go on and on.

27:10.408 --> 27:11.890
But mainly, thank you for your service.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.471
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hester.

27:14.052 --> 27:18.356
Many young men and women gave their best years of their youth in Vietnam in the war.

27:18.777 --> 27:20.098
Some came home, some didn't.

27:20.399 --> 27:25.866
Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hester came home to tell his story, and it's our honor that he has shared it with us.

27:25.886 --> 27:32.374
We thank Jim Hester for his service, and we thank all veterans, and thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:32.394 --> 27:33.415
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:33.435 --> 27:48.955
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:49.154 --> 28:00.531
Amen.
