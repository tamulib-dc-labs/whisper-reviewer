00:08.553 --> 00:19.626
Bye.

00:30.018 --> 00:33.062
Hello and welcome to this very special edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.442 --> 00:47.881
I'm Tom Turbyville and welcome to the beautiful J. Wayne Stark Gallery at the Memorial Student Center at Texas A&M where right now until December the 17th you can witness World War II through the lens of the cameras of the Associated Press.

00:48.382 --> 00:53.308
It's memories of World War II, photographs of the archives of the Associated Press

00:53.288 --> 01:01.016
It is indeed an amazing exhibit, some 126 black and white images that indeed show all aspects of the war.

01:01.737 --> 01:03.078
I've seen it twice now.

01:03.098 --> 01:19.195
And while I've seen the very familiar photographs like the sailor kissing the nurse at Times Square or the raising of the flag at Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima, I guarantee you there are photographs that you have never seen before that you will see at this exhibit at the Stark Gallery.

01:19.833 --> 01:26.040
from Pearl Harbor, the attack on Pearl Harbor to the invasion of D-Day, photographs both stateside and overseas.

01:26.520 --> 01:31.266
And it's our honor to share these 30 minutes with two veterans from the Brazos Valley from World War II.

01:31.606 --> 01:36.251
They have seen this exhibit for the first time today, and they will give you their impressions.

01:36.592 --> 01:39.855
James Rothermel of Brenham was a proud Navy Seabee.

01:40.256 --> 01:45.942
And George Cox of rural Caldwell, veteran of Normandy, wounded during the push through France and Germany.

01:46.343 --> 01:54.701
And later we'll visit with Haskell Monroe, dean of faculties, emeritus at Texas A&M, and a foremost historian of Texas A&M.

01:54.721 --> 01:56.545
But first, meet James Rothermel.

01:56.946 --> 01:59.411
James Rothermel, it's been my pleasure to visit with you before.

01:59.431 --> 02:04.301
You were a Navy Seabee who served both at Guadalcanal and at Okinawa.

02:04.361 --> 02:06.546
Talk a little bit about your experiences there.

02:07.724 --> 02:18.995
Well, at Quarter Canal, we had a very heavy jungle that we had to live in, and the conditions were not very good.

02:19.536 --> 02:29.946
But our primary purpose at Seabees, or Construction Battalion, was to build airfields, roads, hospitals, docks, and whatever it needed built.

02:30.046 --> 02:36.853
We built a tank farm for the oil and the gasoline for the planes that

02:37.441 --> 02:39.163
were flying off the D.C.

02:39.183 --> 02:39.343
office.

02:39.363 --> 02:51.078
It was very dangerous work because you were not only building these airstrips and these hospitals and these bridges, but you were doing it under pretty much constant air rate, nightly air rate, right?

02:51.098 --> 02:53.300
Yes, we were raided constantly.

02:54.442 --> 03:01.030
Most likely maybe five nights out of every week, we were harassed with a plane flying over.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.872
We called him washing machine Charlie.

03:04.194 --> 03:06.857
We'd sit out there and watch him in the lights.

03:07.495 --> 03:15.582
Then when he got ready to leave, when his gas was running low, I'm sure he dropped his bums some places on the island.

03:16.003 --> 03:21.648
And we were fortunate one time to have some bums dropped in our area, but no casualties.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.770
A few of them got a little shrapnel.

03:23.810 --> 03:30.116
I know that some of the images that you've seen here at the Stark Gallery today probably bring back some memories, those memories from the Pacific.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.920
What are your overall impressions of this exhibit that you've seen here today?

03:35.474 --> 03:44.069
Well, I'll tell you, I've seen things that I knew about, but I never knew that had this much recorded.

03:44.089 --> 03:49.338
And the AP Press did a tremendous job of putting this together.

03:49.358 --> 03:54.327
And I just think it's a wonderful exhibit for those people that don't.

03:54.762 --> 04:03.553
didn't really know what was happening to our men overseas, both Europe and Pacific, and it portrays a very good picture of this.

04:03.573 --> 04:07.697
You know, these days, the war on terror, the media is very, very prominent.

04:07.717 --> 04:09.099
What was it like in World War II?

04:09.179 --> 04:13.965
Can you recall a media presence where you all were fighting?

04:13.985 --> 04:19.952
Yes, at Okinawa, I remember Ernie Powell, and he came to outfit.

04:19.972 --> 04:24.077
He visited nearly every outfit on the island, and just to

04:24.513 --> 04:28.701
A few days after, maybe a week after, he was killed on Hiroshima.

04:29.422 --> 04:35.834
And he was a great journalist and photographer and what have you.

04:36.435 --> 04:39.962
And everybody really loved him once they met him.

04:39.982 --> 04:40.643
Indeed.

04:40.663 --> 04:46.053
Are there any photographs that you saw here at the exhibit that you sort of stood in front of a little bit longer than others?

04:46.074 --> 04:46.875
Right.

04:47.227 --> 04:53.817
Guadalcanal, one where the troops were coming off a 21-day combat mission.

04:53.837 --> 04:57.523
I remember that trail after the fighting was over.

04:58.064 --> 05:02.331
And Henderson Field, those are some things I remember at Guadalcanal.

05:02.351 --> 05:10.083
But at Okinawa, I do remember landing there in April of 45 with the Kamikaz planes attacking.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.627
And there's a photograph

05:13.028 --> 05:19.061
of the USS Franklin aircraft carrier was listening and it took a hit.

05:19.421 --> 05:22.107
And I got to see that ship while it was in dock there.

05:22.788 --> 05:28.400
And then also the landing craft, we landed there with LSTs.

05:28.821 --> 05:33.771
And you can see out in the waters, all of the other ships is one of the largest

05:33.751 --> 05:38.961
group of ships that ever were put together to come to Okinawa.

05:38.981 --> 05:42.829
We have some of the photographs from the exhibit, as a matter of fact, that I'm going to hold up.

05:42.849 --> 05:47.237
And while you may not have been involved in these exact photographs, they were from the Pacific Campaign.

05:47.588 --> 05:56.357
This photograph right here, of course, probably the most famous, is folks are looking at that, the actual photograph from the exhibit over your left shoulder here.

05:56.377 --> 05:57.998
This is Mount Suribachi.

05:58.018 --> 06:05.926
As a matter of fact, we had a guest on Veterans of the Valley just a couple of weeks ago, Ed Eyre, who was with the 5th Marines, who remembers this happening.

06:05.966 --> 06:10.251
This is certainly memorable to all veterans, isn't it?

06:10.271 --> 06:14.395
Yes, and I want you to know that this is in Washington, D.C.

06:14.495 --> 06:16.617
also, and then you have one that

06:17.288 --> 06:20.071
exact replica of it in Holland, Texas.

06:20.272 --> 06:20.752
Did you know that?

06:20.772 --> 06:22.554
Is that right?

06:22.574 --> 06:26.739
Yeah, of course, in Washington, D.C., that's where the monument is.

06:26.799 --> 06:29.102
This is actually a Marine on Okinawa.

06:29.983 --> 06:31.725
Obviously, you probably didn't know this gentleman.

06:31.765 --> 06:36.150
His name is Paul Isom, and this is what was called Death Valley, taken in May of 1945.

06:37.211 --> 06:40.696
But this, is this somewhat typical of the type?

06:41.036 --> 06:46.182
Yes, Okinawa was bombed and shelled so severely

06:46.465 --> 06:49.974
that hardly any trees or any life was left on the island.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.257
It was just a bare island.

06:53.964 --> 07:03.529
That photograph, the leathernecks of the Marines, as a matter of fact, lost 125 men in just eight hours of fighting while that photograph was being taken.

07:03.745 --> 07:05.127
Another famous photograph right here.

07:05.147 --> 07:06.650
This is the USS Missouri.

07:06.670 --> 07:09.474
This is the Japanese surrender near the signing of the war.

07:09.494 --> 07:13.961
This was obviously something very important to everybody who fought because this meant you were going home.

07:14.742 --> 07:15.904
That's right.

07:15.924 --> 07:22.995
When that happened, you don't know how elated every man was that we knew that we were going to get to go home.

07:23.015 --> 07:23.335
Indeed.

07:23.736 --> 07:26.360
This is a photograph here.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.183
It's called a patrol on Guam.

07:28.670 --> 07:30.953
I know you didn't serve on Guam, though, did you?

07:31.273 --> 07:32.675
But very similar to this.

07:33.717 --> 07:37.402
It was jungle-like on Guam and a lot of the islands in the Pacific.

07:37.502 --> 07:40.666
So this is obviously a very moving photograph.

07:40.706 --> 07:48.076
When you showed me those prior to this presentation, I said, that looks just like Guadalcanal.

07:48.096 --> 07:49.157
Right, right.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.481
A lot of the terrain was exactly the same.

07:53.663 --> 07:57.428
I know that you're very proud of the World War II Memorial, that you had a big hand in

07:57.695 --> 08:04.524
And Brent, real quickly, we've just got about 30 seconds left, but talk to people about that memorial, and you certainly want people to come visit it.

08:05.285 --> 08:05.525
Yes.

08:06.106 --> 08:16.659
Our memorial has not only just World War II veterans, but veterans from the Civil War throughout the war to present day time.

08:17.119 --> 08:24.729
We have over 2,000 bricks, and our memorial is built in a circle, and it has tears that you can walk and read.

08:24.749 --> 08:27.212
You don't have to stoop or look up to.

08:27.631 --> 08:36.603
We have some nice columns with some bronze emblems of the various stuff.

08:36.623 --> 08:36.864
Right.

08:36.964 --> 08:39.948
It is truly a beautiful memorial, and I hope people will visit it.

08:40.248 --> 08:43.233
James Rothermel, thank you for your service, and thank you for being here today.

08:44.194 --> 08:48.660
James Rothermel, we'll be back with George Cox, Normandy veteran, in just a moment.

08:50.412 --> 09:03.950
Welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, and welcome back to the J. Wayne Stark Gallery at the MSC at Texas A&M, where the exhibit, The Memories of World War II, photographs from the archives of the Associated Press, will be on exhibit until December the 17th.

09:03.990 --> 09:06.793
We hope you come by and view this exhibit.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.295
Let's meet George Cox.

09:08.375 --> 09:11.559
George Cox is a veteran of Normandy.

09:11.579 --> 09:13.262
Mr. Cox, it's a pleasure to have you here.

09:13.342 --> 09:17.287
You landed at Normandy on the Invasion Day, on D-Day.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.208
Talk a little bit about

09:18.712 --> 09:19.453
what your job was.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.714
I know you were a tank commander.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.436
Talk about that day and what you remember.

09:23.257 --> 09:26.301
We was on a little landing craft.

09:26.321 --> 09:30.005
It helped five tanks and three jeeps on there with us.

09:30.906 --> 09:33.650
And we came in at about 11.30 in the morning.

09:34.430 --> 09:36.233
And they'd already pushed in from the beach.

09:36.313 --> 09:38.135
When we got there, we were in reserve.

09:39.156 --> 09:43.902
And we let the ramp down on the little boat.

09:43.922 --> 09:44.682
They let us out.

09:45.263 --> 09:47.706
And I was the last one in line and had a jeep behind me.

09:48.175 --> 09:53.361
And the water come up within two inches of the top of the tank.

09:53.381 --> 09:58.927
And the Jeep went underwater and the men had to stand in the seats to try to float and get out there.

09:58.967 --> 10:03.732
And I had to look, move my tank around to the right and take them out of there before they drowned it out there.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.135
You're a tank commander.

10:06.916 --> 10:10.720
Take us past D-Day and your push in.

10:11.281 --> 10:15.786
And talk about the day that you were wounded as a tank commander, how that came about.

10:15.985 --> 10:19.671
Well, we pushed on in that afternoon and we pulled in an apple orchard.

10:19.711 --> 10:21.294
It was the time we got there.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.078
It was getting dark and we went to bed.

10:24.118 --> 10:32.372
And next morning before daylight, we got up and they assigned us to the 101st Air Barn to go in to take St.

10:32.392 --> 10:33.133
Ameriglis.

10:33.653 --> 10:37.398
And on the way there, we run into the 82nd that was pinned down.

10:38.019 --> 10:44.447
I had some 150, 200 German soldiers there against about eight or 10 of ours, it looked like.

10:44.608 --> 10:46.290
That's all I could see.

10:46.310 --> 10:52.878
And we pulled around in there helping them out and trying to put fire on the enemy there.

10:52.979 --> 10:56.303
And they hit my tank and knocked it out and killed my gunner.

10:58.038 --> 11:04.345
Then they sent me back to the beach and sent me back to England and patched me up and sent me back on July the 29th.

11:04.366 --> 11:09.011
They sent me back and gave me another tank to fight all the way through to Elbe River in Germany.

11:09.411 --> 11:12.135
You were wounded and you proudly wear your Purple Heart, of course.

11:13.937 --> 11:17.942
You've had a chance to see this exhibit here at the MSC at the Stark Gallery.

11:18.142 --> 11:20.805
Talk some about your impressions of what you've seen today.

11:21.038 --> 11:24.084
Well, you see a lot of things and brings memories back.

11:24.224 --> 11:29.875
When I looked at one picture in particular, it was a whole bunch of soldiers who surrendered at the end of the war.

11:29.916 --> 11:42.861
It reminded me of the time that we had come by there and there's four machine guns and about 10,000 troops standing in the field out there waiting to be trucked back to camps where they keep them.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.542
and had an Italian with me from New York.

11:46.882 --> 11:49.785
And he said, look, there's thousands and thousands and thousands.

11:49.825 --> 11:50.866
The war is over.

11:51.848 --> 11:52.989
But it really wasn't then.

11:53.009 --> 11:55.692
We fought several days after that before it was over.

11:56.513 --> 11:57.414
Indeed.

11:57.434 --> 12:07.245
On the 50th anniversary, I believe, or the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion, I believe it was, well, you returned to Normandy.

12:07.529 --> 12:30.668
year or so ago talk about that return i know that yes we had been over there the year before and we met a little frenchman and he was seven years old when we come through there fighting his mama put him in a chicken house and put him in a hole put 10 over him so he wouldn't get killed and and we wrote told him we was coming back over there so they invited us for lunch and the lunch was from 1 30 to 5 30.

12:31.373 --> 12:39.038
And about three o'clock, they give us a little drink there to settle our stomachs, they said, and calvados.

12:39.355 --> 12:46.684
Then a busload of people come through there from Germany, and there was troops that had surrendered to us when we was there.

12:47.325 --> 12:54.093
And he wanted to know about what had happened to us there with the tank, and we explained it to him.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.737
And when he left, he said, I'm sure glad we didn't kill you so we could visit with you.

12:58.618 --> 13:02.763
And, you know, it was just outstanding and very emotional.

13:02.784 --> 13:08.130
It must have been surreal the way it was, because you were breaking bread with the same men that you had

13:08.482 --> 13:09.923
had fought decades before.

13:09.943 --> 13:10.204
Yeah.

13:11.184 --> 13:12.726
It was a marvelous experience.

13:13.807 --> 13:14.808
Very emotional.

13:15.589 --> 13:17.791
And they have invited us to come back over there.

13:18.772 --> 13:21.554
And we was there last year.

13:21.754 --> 13:27.079
We stayed down at Bayou out of Cannes down there on the beach.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.163
And we got to see all of that part of where the war was at over there.

13:31.223 --> 13:34.146
The Omaha Beach, which was the roughest.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.729
And where the British and the Polish and the French and all fought over there.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.233
So we enjoyed it very much.

13:41.474 --> 13:42.515
It was quite a trip.

13:42.535 --> 13:43.416
I know it was.

13:43.436 --> 13:50.404
I want to look at some of the photographs from the J. Wayne Stark Gallery that you'll see at this exhibit of Associated Press photographs from World War II.

13:50.865 --> 13:52.807
I'm going to hold some of them up here.

13:53.328 --> 13:55.030
This is D-Day, as a matter of fact.

13:55.050 --> 14:03.199
I'm not sure whether this is a Utah beach, the beach that you landed at, but this obviously is very similar to what you saw on that day in June of 1944.

14:03.439 --> 14:05.982
Yes, that's what it was.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.205
All up and down the beach there.

14:08.708 --> 14:14.897
ships bringing in people, bringing in soldiers, and bringing in everything that you needed there.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.018
Supplies and everything.

14:16.038 --> 14:24.049
There's a beachmaster on the beach at Control, and they'd radio out the ship they want this, and they'd bring it to them, and they'd put it out on the beach out there.

14:26.433 --> 14:33.763
Everybody had a job, and they just did their job, and it all worked out.

14:33.783 --> 14:35.265
This is a photograph here of U.S.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.568
troops in Paris at the Champs-Élysées.

14:38.138 --> 14:45.529
I believe I read that Patton didn't really look at Paris as necessarily a big stronghold in Europe, but later on it became that way.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.553
Did you ever make it to Paris in your Paris?

14:48.614 --> 14:55.924
I had a three-day pass there at one time, while I was on the way back home in 1945 in October.

14:56.445 --> 15:03.616
So you remember the Champs-Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe there, so that's obviously a very familiar scene to you.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.197
I was doing that.

15:04.217 --> 15:05.879
We were 30 miles south of Paris.

15:07.522 --> 15:07.842
Indeed.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.395
This is a photograph, a very moving photograph.

15:11.476 --> 15:16.106
What this is, actually, is allied POWs in a liberated camp.

15:16.547 --> 15:28.733
It's a German POW camp, actually, in France, where Russians, Italians, Serbians, Poles, and Frenchmen were all held.

15:29.287 --> 15:34.392
any come across any type of a camps or POW installations while you were there?

15:34.652 --> 15:42.079
We ran into one with the Belgium troops in it and it was like a garage.

15:42.099 --> 15:43.800
We opened the door and here they all come out.

15:43.820 --> 15:44.761
We liberated them.

15:44.801 --> 15:46.603
They was all to hug us and everything.

15:46.663 --> 15:50.226
They was all hungry and poor and everything there.

15:50.286 --> 15:55.071
I passed by one camp and the boys went back to it, but I didn't want to go.

15:55.191 --> 15:57.353
I had seen enough for me.

15:58.193 --> 16:00.496
I thought this was an interesting photograph that's from the exhibit.

16:00.516 --> 16:04.901
This is a flying fortress, a V-17 flying over Tunisia.

16:05.302 --> 16:11.730
And these are some American soldiers during a day off riding some camels and waving to that flying fortress.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.372
I thought that was a very interesting photograph.

16:13.772 --> 16:14.493
Very interesting.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.055
Indeed.

16:16.075 --> 16:20.120
I guess you would urge people to come to this exhibit and see quite a bit of history of World War II.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.222
If you're interested in history, why it's good to see.

16:22.303 --> 16:25.146
It's a lot of reality here of what went on.

16:26.493 --> 16:26.934
Indeed.

16:27.494 --> 16:30.177
This photograph here, St.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.580
Paul's Cathedral in London.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.785
I believe you told me earlier you didn't have a chance to get to London, though, right?

16:37.326 --> 16:39.228
No, sir, I didn't get a chance to go to London.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.752
There's too many people going, and I wasn't interested in getting in the crowd.

16:42.832 --> 16:45.516
I just stayed at Fairfail England.

16:46.016 --> 16:46.296
Indeed.

16:46.397 --> 16:55.167
But this is the smoke and the haze from a bombing in London, obviously a very significant part of the war.

16:56.733 --> 17:06.527
Your World War II experience and being a veteran, I know it means an awful lot to you, and you're very proud to talk about your service and the service of your comrades.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.208
Why is that?

17:07.228 --> 17:09.011
Why are you so proud of it?

17:11.294 --> 17:12.196
Wonderful country.

17:12.656 --> 17:12.977
Yes, sir.

17:14.419 --> 17:15.420
I didn't volunteer.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.223
I was drafted.

17:17.243 --> 17:20.247
I was really a conscientious objector of religious people.

17:20.588 --> 17:23.432
I didn't want to kill the folks.

17:24.475 --> 17:27.238
They told me that they would make good soldiers come on.

17:27.318 --> 17:29.920
And they took me right on and they put us up there on the front.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.527
And the bond that you have with the people that you fight with there is just marvelous.

17:37.627 --> 17:45.274
You come from all over the country, all over the United States, and then you get in there together and you just do your job and it worked out.

17:46.595 --> 17:47.796
Indeed, we're glad it worked out.

17:47.856 --> 17:49.998
We're glad you're with us to tell the story.

17:50.018 --> 17:52.460
And thank you very, very much for your service.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.201
Thank you.

17:53.221 --> 17:54.162
Thank you, George Cox.

17:54.935 --> 18:00.787
George Cox is a proud veteran of World War II and a survivor of Normandy, and he proudly wears his purple heart.

18:01.087 --> 18:04.093
When we come back, we're going to visit with Haskell Monroe.

18:04.113 --> 18:09.364
He is a dean of faculties emeritus here at Texas A&M and a foremost historian of Texas A&M.

18:09.384 --> 18:13.251
He has some interesting stories to tell, and we have some more photographs to show you.

18:13.311 --> 18:14.614
We'll be back in just a moment.

18:17.378 --> 18:18.740
Welcome back to Veterans of the Valley.

18:18.820 --> 18:33.839
I'm Tom Turbyville and welcome back to the J. Wayne Stark Gallery here right adjacent to the beautiful flag room at the Memorial Student Center at Texas A&M where we are talking to you about memories of World War II photographs from the archives of the Associated Press.

18:33.899 --> 18:37.243
Want to remind you that the hours here at the J. Wayne Stark Gallery

18:37.561 --> 18:43.548
from 9 o'clock to 8 o'clock every Tuesday through Friday, and they're open Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 6.

18:43.608 --> 18:48.655
So you've got a lot of chances every day except Monday to come out and look at this wonderful exhibit.

18:48.915 --> 18:50.597
We're going to visit now with Haskell Monroe.

18:50.637 --> 18:53.380
I've had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Monroe for quite a while.

18:53.400 --> 18:59.268
He is the Dean of Faculty's Emeritus here at Texas A&M and used to be at the University of Missouri also, right?

18:59.328 --> 19:02.792
You were Chancellor at the University of Missouri.

19:03.363 --> 19:07.131
I called you one of the foremost historians of Texas A&M.

19:07.171 --> 19:09.897
You immediately wanted to give credit elsewhere for that.

19:09.917 --> 19:15.929
You know a lot of history of Texas A&M, but I wanted you to give that credit where credit is due as far as historian of A&M.

19:16.110 --> 19:19.697
Henry Detloff should have that title.

19:20.098 --> 19:20.819
He wrote the book.

19:20.839 --> 19:21.601
He wrote the book.

19:22.363 --> 19:24.527
And a splendid colleague and a good friend.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.143
but you know quite a bit of it.

19:26.263 --> 19:42.094
And I wanna talk to you about World War II and Texas A&M and what you know of that, sort of what Texas A&M was like back in the mid 40s and when the war broke out and as the war went and sort of how it affected its student body and really the whole community here.

19:42.412 --> 19:49.800
My source of information for all of that is 219 oral history interviews with, quote, old-time Aggies.

19:50.741 --> 19:58.230
And I love to summarize what I learned from that by telling people with a straight face some of what Aggies remember is true.

20:00.132 --> 20:11.845
Now, the particularly graphic day came when the people recalled being in Guyon Auditorium at the matinee movie

20:12.331 --> 20:19.302
on Sunday, December 7, and the movie was interrupted by an announcement that Pearl Harbor had been bombed.

20:20.463 --> 20:29.698
They all said we went back to our rooms as quickly as we could because we knew this was really going to affect us.

20:29.718 --> 20:36.388
And so they went in all directions as did all other Americans of that age and that generation.

20:37.149 --> 20:39.132
Some of us were a little younger,

20:39.230 --> 20:46.177
My dad was a construction carpenter up at the new army camp at Fort Smith, Arkansas.

20:46.718 --> 20:53.525
And so the next day as a sixth grader, I and my classmates went to the library.

20:53.545 --> 20:58.009
One of the teachers had brought a great big Philco radio and put it on the table.

20:58.610 --> 21:01.633
And we listened to Franklin Roosevelt's unforgettable speech.

21:02.994 --> 21:06.217
We then had a recess and went out in the playground.

21:06.237 --> 21:07.819
And one of the things we talked about

21:08.086 --> 21:14.355
was one of our teachers was really, really crying because she had a brother in a place called the Philippines.

21:15.096 --> 21:17.660
We couldn't understand why that would bother her.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.923
What's bad about the Philippines?

21:19.943 --> 21:23.268
We didn't know our geography, but we soon learned.

21:23.288 --> 21:28.575
And I would argue that World War II may have touched more Americans

21:29.011 --> 21:35.219
in terms of 100% of the population than any other event in our history.

21:35.239 --> 21:44.852
And I believe that it changed our lives so much because most of our families had been badly scarred by the Depression.

21:44.872 --> 21:47.936
Here was something that was changing.

21:47.957 --> 21:54.205
And as soon as the war started, nobody asked any questions about who would win the war.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.688
We all knew who was going to win it.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.731
It was just, how long would it take?

21:59.622 --> 22:04.589
Here at A&M, most of the students went away very, very quickly.

22:05.951 --> 22:17.628
The academic programs were consolidated and people graduated in fewer months by having 12-month programs and things like that.

22:17.648 --> 22:23.356
Then there were special training programs by various branches of the service here.

22:23.376 --> 22:27.402
Of course, the enrollment of regular students went down.

22:27.382 --> 22:42.256
And then so many other people were relocated all over the United States to work in defense industries, to help build bases, to work in the plants that made everything.

22:42.276 --> 22:47.642
And one of the very, very, very noticeable changes was the role of women.

22:47.662 --> 22:56.410
I believe World War II had a greater impact on women and equality and their potential than any other event in our history.

22:56.474 --> 22:57.595
Indeed, I agree with you.

22:57.615 --> 23:05.662
As a matter of fact, I know from my own personal knowledge of my own family that women were very instrumental in building airplanes.

23:05.682 --> 23:15.091
They built the F6F Hellcat at Grauman because the men who normally were on those assembly lines were off at war, and that plane had to be built actually during wartime.

23:15.111 --> 23:23.639
You, before he died, got a chance to meet Omar Bradley, and he talked to you about your friend, General James Earl Rudder.

23:23.939 --> 23:25.080
Talk about that conversation.

23:25.128 --> 23:29.794
I was, this was my first year as president at the University of Texas at El Paso, 1980.

23:29.874 --> 23:34.539
I go to a football game in this campus stadium named the Sun Bowl.

23:34.559 --> 23:38.364
A friend comes up to me and said, come up here, come over here, I want you to meet somebody.

23:39.105 --> 23:39.525
Who is it?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.227
You'll find out when you get there.

23:41.928 --> 23:52.401
We walk up behind a man that I would have described as an old man and walked around in front of him and I saw that it was Omar Bradley, age 86.

23:53.005 --> 23:55.753
He looked at me and quickly said, You're from A&M?

23:56.033 --> 23:56.434
Yes, sir.

23:57.297 --> 23:58.279
Did you know Earl Rudder?

23:58.420 --> 23:58.881
Yes, sir.

23:58.901 --> 24:00.165
Reported to him.

24:00.185 --> 24:02.270
Did a number of tasks for him.

24:02.290 --> 24:06.863
His voice then quivered with emotion as he said words I will never forget.

24:07.636 --> 24:26.216
In 48 years of command responsibility, I never gave a more awful order to any officer than the one I gave to Earl the night before D-Day, because if he and his men had made it up to the top of that cliff when they did, we would have had a massacre on both beaches.

24:26.236 --> 24:36.647
Having seen those beaches since then, I now understand how correct his statement was and what that symbolized for everyone.

24:37.538 --> 24:38.420
Indeed.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.423
That's a great story, and thank you for telling it.

24:40.703 --> 24:47.355
We've just got a couple of minutes left, and I want to just show a couple of more pictures from this exhibit.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.477
This is a very famous picture.

24:48.517 --> 24:53.465
This is the sailor kissing the nurse at Times Square, and you were thinking that maybe this was posed.

24:53.525 --> 24:56.290
I was thinking more that this was pretty much an off-the-cuff type of picture.

24:56.354 --> 24:59.399
But he would have been willing to repeat it if they needed him to.

24:59.420 --> 24:59.820
I think so.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.964
And I think for a long time nobody knew who that nurse was.

25:02.004 --> 25:04.729
But I think that now I think people know who the nurse is.

25:04.749 --> 25:07.714
This is another picture from the exhibit that I thought was just wonderful.

25:07.795 --> 25:14.246
These are American soldiers on the Queen Elizabeth hanging out of the portholes August of 1945.

25:14.807 --> 25:17.793
The war is over and they're coming home and you can tell that they're having a good time.

25:18.895 --> 25:19.436
Absolutely.

25:19.516 --> 25:20.758
That's a great picture.

25:20.738 --> 25:24.584
Here is another photograph from Times Square that you want to take.

25:24.604 --> 25:28.691
That sort of speaks for itself, the celebration there at Times Square.

25:28.711 --> 25:30.554
And finally, this picture.

25:31.255 --> 25:35.021
Jimmy Stewart, fine soldier, fine actor.

25:35.462 --> 25:41.913
A lot of people might not know, he might have been a better soldier even, as he was signing up for induction into the Army Air Corps.

25:43.034 --> 25:44.417
Let me add one more thing.

25:44.998 --> 25:47.742
The GI Bill, which followed the war,

25:48.025 --> 25:56.140
changed so many Americans in what their dreams of their life accomplishment could be.

25:56.160 --> 26:00.247
It may be the best investment this taxpaying nation ever made.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.429
Indeed, I agree with you.

26:01.670 --> 26:02.912
And thank you, Haskell Monroe.

26:03.601 --> 26:07.487
And thanks very much to James Rothermel, Navy CB, and to George Cox for joining us.

26:07.527 --> 26:11.893
And please come to the J. Wayne Stark Gallery and see this wonderful exhibition.

26:11.913 --> 26:16.620
It is called Memories of World War II, Photographs from the Archives of the Associated Press.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.042
I'm Tom Turbeville.

26:18.062 --> 26:32.022
Please thank a veteran today, and we'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

26:38.785 --> 26:42.585
Thank you.
