00:08.671 --> 00:09.586
you

00:21.496 --> 00:23.459
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:23.479 --> 00:24.480
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:24.801 --> 00:34.474
This is our spotlight on the Veterans of the Brazos Valley, young men and young women who gave the best years of their lives to defend our country, all heroes of the Brazos Valley.

00:34.494 --> 00:43.887
There is a vast collection of special citizens gathered from time to time at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4692 out on FM 2818.

00:44.888 --> 00:49.074
And I would like to welcome their post commander, Rick Olivares, to Veterans of the Valley.

00:49.094 --> 00:50.676
Rick, welcome to our studio.

00:50.926 --> 00:51.747
Thank you very much, Tom.

00:51.767 --> 00:52.508
I'm glad to be here.

00:52.648 --> 01:02.019
We're going to talk a lot about the VFW, the VFW Post, what they do all year long for the youth, for the entire community and some of your membership out there.

01:02.039 --> 01:04.502
But I want to talk a little bit about you and your service.

01:04.922 --> 01:10.408
You are a Vietnam vet, although you are quick to note that you did not serve necessarily on the front lines.

01:10.849 --> 01:12.190
Very fascinating story.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.173
You were involved in intelligence.

01:14.233 --> 01:18.958
Talk a little bit about your service to our country from 1968 to 72.

01:19.445 --> 01:33.522
Well, I went into training through Lackland Air Force Base and immediately thereafter I went to Denver, Colorado to Lowry Air Force Base where I actually was trained in intelligence for about a period of nine months.

01:34.008 --> 01:41.100
It was a top secret requirement to have that, and so consequently it took a while to get into the school.

01:41.120 --> 01:47.572
But once I got into the school, we learned so many procedures and things that we needed to use in the field.

01:48.734 --> 01:56.387
I specialized primarily in photo intelligence, photo interpretation, as well as target specialists.

01:57.059 --> 02:01.484
That helped me in my future bases that I went to.

02:02.806 --> 02:05.509
I was there for, like I said, nine months in the school.

02:06.090 --> 02:12.477
And then after graduation from the school, they shipped me to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona.

02:13.358 --> 02:14.880
There, of course, it was desert type.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.303
It was hot, but it was dry.

02:17.323 --> 02:21.748
And it reminded me so much of my hometown of Eagle Pass, Texas, because that's exactly the same weather.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.412
And so I was comfortable being in that environment.

02:26.455 --> 02:37.068
What was interesting about that tour there in Tucson was that that's the mothball base for all kinds of aircraft in the military that are disposed of.

02:37.789 --> 02:54.690
And at the time that I was there, back in the early 68, 69 period, we worked with U-2 pilots and a lot of missions that they flew over in Cuba and missions they flew into the Eastern Bloc countries.

02:55.278 --> 03:02.366
And that was an interesting deal because at the time, we weren't supposed to talk about where they were flying and so forth.

03:02.847 --> 03:05.390
Because that's 35 plus years ago.

03:05.410 --> 03:11.156
But I got to meet, of all people, Francis Gary Powers at one time.

03:11.176 --> 03:16.463
And later on, he became, I think, a traffic controller in Los Angeles.

03:16.523 --> 03:18.585
And I believe he crashed in his helicopter.

03:19.105 --> 03:20.047
But I got to meet him.

03:20.548 --> 03:39.021
The assignment was very interesting in that we would actually view some of the film that was taken by the U-2s and interpret the different sites from AAA and artillery to aircraft on the ground and ships that were maybe moving across.

03:39.524 --> 03:42.549
And there's so many techniques to apply that that field was interesting.

03:42.790 --> 03:47.819
And you can tell actually the speed of a ship by the wake it leaves and the angle.

03:48.320 --> 03:57.235
Also by the sunlight, you can tell if these petrochemical tanks are full or half empty of oils or whatever materials they have in there.

03:57.556 --> 04:00.120
So there's a lot of techniques you have to learn to interpret this.

04:00.701 --> 04:04.468
Plus, at the same time, you've got to be trained on aircraft recognition.

04:05.107 --> 04:12.655
We had to know all kinds of aircraft, from what the Russians used to their friends.

04:12.675 --> 04:20.604
And also, we had to recognize a lot of different ships, if they were SAM-2s, SAM-3 sites, and so forth.

04:20.624 --> 04:23.507
So there was a lot of training to be done on that.

04:23.527 --> 04:33.358
Right after I was in Tucson, I did get sent over to Thailand, to Utapau Base, where I ended up working with the B-52s.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.613
I got to meet a lot of good people there.

04:36.633 --> 04:43.942
That was one of the bases that I really enjoyed because those guys were something else.

04:44.582 --> 04:48.027
That base actually flew missions around the clock.

04:48.047 --> 04:53.233
We had cells of three going out and coming back constantly 24 hours a day.

04:53.253 --> 04:59.060
And we, of course, worked sometimes 12-hour shifts, seven days straight.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.345
Then there was little time for relaxation, maybe three days off after we worked seven.

05:03.916 --> 05:07.783
But the main thing was that we did a lot of plotting.

05:08.023 --> 05:10.588
We did a lot of target specialist plotting.

05:10.608 --> 05:12.391
We did a lot of photo interpretation.

05:13.072 --> 05:16.578
We did briefings and debriefings of their missions.

05:16.598 --> 05:23.691
And there were, of course, missions that I can't talk about that we undertook during that period of time.

05:23.711 --> 05:25.654
And I was there for one year.

05:26.512 --> 05:32.919
After that, I wanted to re-up and come back to stay in Thailand another year, but they wouldn't let me.

05:32.939 --> 05:35.962
They said, no, it's just you've been here one year, we're going to send you back stateside.

05:37.183 --> 05:46.113
I tried to get all my superiors to write a letter to the commanding general to let me stay and amend my orders, but that didn't work.

05:46.193 --> 05:50.157
He said, no, your order's already been cut, you're ready to be shipped back to the states.

05:50.288 --> 05:57.555
Well, as soon as I got back to the state, needless to say, I was shipped to North Carolina Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, again with B-52s.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.058
And I decided that that wasn't the place for me.

06:01.098 --> 06:02.059
I didn't want to be stateside.

06:02.099 --> 06:03.140
I wanted to go serve.

06:04.121 --> 06:06.142
So I volunteered for anything that came up.

06:07.063 --> 06:13.289
And I volunteered for Guam, was one of the places that they needed a lot of intelligence specialists.

06:13.309 --> 06:15.831
And we did a lot of, and I got shipped out there.

06:15.871 --> 06:17.933
When I first got to Guam,

06:18.014 --> 06:42.199
the the base was semi-empty it wasn't very crowded but as the missions picked up in late 71 72 uh the personnel started arriving and when i first got there i was in an nco barracks i mean i had it well i didn't like flint you know it was perfect however by the time the personnel came in uh superior

06:42.466 --> 06:50.559
NCOs and officers, they bumped me out of the actual barracks, and they put me in an army tent.

06:50.579 --> 06:58.492
And that was miserable because, as you may know, Guam is so, so humid that you could not sleep at night.

06:58.632 --> 07:01.817
Every sheet, every time was constantly damp and wet.

07:02.278 --> 07:05.824
We'd have fans, of course, but fans only blew was damp air.

07:06.665 --> 07:08.608
So that wasn't a very lively experience.

07:09.061 --> 07:23.288
And because we also worked 12-hour shifts and because the sleeping accommodations weren't up to par, the only reprieve I could find was to maybe go to the movie house where that was air-conditioned.

07:23.308 --> 07:27.255
And I would go to the movies, but not to watch the movie, but simply to take a nap in there.

07:28.670 --> 07:31.976
After that, if it wasn't there, I would go to the NCO club.

07:31.997 --> 07:36.786
That was the only other place that I can remember, recall, that was actually air-conditioned.

07:36.806 --> 07:40.072
And so we'd put shit pool and drink a few beers and so forth.

07:40.714 --> 07:45.803
But you couldn't do much of that because you were constantly busy and you were on call all the time you were there.

07:45.904 --> 07:50.172
If they needed you to come back to the shop to work, you had to be there.

07:50.152 --> 07:53.537
So that was the extent of my tour there in Guam.

07:54.178 --> 08:00.667
Eventually, they sent me back to Seymour Johnson, and they wanted me to re-up.

08:00.687 --> 08:05.614
They were going to pay me a variable re-enlistment bonus because my field was a very critical field at the time.

08:06.375 --> 08:11.863
They wanted me to go to language school, to Monterey, to learn Portuguese of all languages.

08:12.304 --> 08:16.530
And they were going to promise to send me to Lisbon, Portugal, to the Eradice office there.

08:16.949 --> 08:21.133
Plus, they also said, we'll send you back to A&M and you can finish your degree.

08:21.153 --> 08:29.942
I was already a senior at A&M, but I did not want to go back to A&M because they wanted me to major in engineering.

08:29.962 --> 08:36.408
And I was already committed to chemistry, which is what I eventually got my degree in, was in biochemistry.

08:36.428 --> 08:44.256
So I turned that whole deal down, not because I didn't like the service, because I enjoyed the work I did,

08:44.776 --> 08:48.923
It was because I did not want to become an engineer.

08:49.524 --> 08:58.600
I just came back to A&M on my own, used my GI Bill, and found a job on campus and went through the school program and graduated.

08:59.021 --> 09:01.845
So that's basically my experience in the service.

09:02.266 --> 09:07.375
You talked about your experience with the B-52s and the U-2 pilots and meeting Francis Gary Powers.

09:07.878 --> 09:13.687
You told me earlier about an experiment with drones under the wings of C-130s.

09:13.967 --> 09:14.808
Pretty fascinating.

09:14.848 --> 09:15.569
Talk about that.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.974
Yeah, that was another aspect of our photo intelligence.

09:20.657 --> 09:37.682
We would actually, these drones, which are nothing like the Predator they've got now, they were bigger and bulkier, and they were launched off of the wings of a C-130 out in the Gulf of Tonkin, and they would launch them into Vietnam, North Vietnam at that.

09:38.135 --> 09:42.909
through Hanoi, where it was completely surrounded by AAA and SAM sites.

09:43.531 --> 09:51.756
And one of the most interesting things about that was that here's a picture of the camera of the drone taking a picture of a radio tower.

09:52.512 --> 09:57.156
And the other side of the radio tower is a MiG-15 starting to shoot at the drone.

09:57.376 --> 10:01.140
And this picture caught that, that action in still motion.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.521
And it was so fascinating.

10:02.901 --> 10:08.506
But those jets fly so fast, these drones are so small compared and slower that they missed.

10:09.047 --> 10:16.714
So this drone eventually was radio commanded by the C-130, and it flew back, took the pictures, and came back out into the Gulf.

10:16.734 --> 10:21.658
Once it got back into the Gulf, then they would deploy a helicopter who would use a hook

10:22.229 --> 10:27.336
The drone would open a parachute, and the helicopter would fly with a hook and snatch it.

10:28.097 --> 10:29.859
And when it snatch it, it'd bring it back to the ship.

10:30.320 --> 10:36.528
They'd take the film out, they'd process it, they'd send it to us, and we would interpret the photos that they had taken.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.051
But that was very interesting.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.614
But nothing like the predators that they have nowadays.

10:40.634 --> 10:42.196
Sounds like a scene out of James Bond.

10:42.356 --> 10:44.940
Very, very close to that.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.482
I cannot imagine...

10:46.782 --> 10:54.431
how highly classified your position must have been in this security that you must have had to go through to secure a position like you had.

10:54.791 --> 11:01.919
It took almost my four years in the service to get my above top secret.

11:01.939 --> 11:05.924
The top secret is really the highest security clearance, but there are degrees of it.

11:06.705 --> 11:13.853
And mine was what they call SIOP-ESI, which is Specially Integrated Operations Plans, especially sensitive information.

11:14.356 --> 11:27.013
So there was a lot of information in there that was very well needed and useful, but not only very few people could actually view that and have access to it.

11:27.033 --> 11:31.560
So it took almost four years that I was into it to move to that level.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.564
You were in Thailand, which wasn't the front lines.

11:34.664 --> 11:34.904
Right.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.567
But you were right next door.

11:36.687 --> 11:39.030
Yeah, I was within 25 miles of Cambodia borders.

11:39.905 --> 11:41.908
Very close, very close indeed.

11:42.488 --> 11:44.952
Did you see any insurgency in Thailand?

11:45.132 --> 11:46.894
I saw what they claimed.

11:47.135 --> 11:55.045
They never made it to Utapau while I was there, but they did claim that there were some insurgents coming in Cambodia into Thailand at the time.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.208
They never made it up to the base.

11:57.228 --> 12:02.275
Now, when I left, I think I was still in Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.

12:02.415 --> 12:07.161
I did hear, or maybe it was a year or two after, where they had gone into Utapau.

12:07.867 --> 12:11.031
and because they were repelled back by the Thais.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.316
Utapau is no longer an Air Force base.

12:14.336 --> 12:16.919
It belongs to the Thai government, Tim.

12:16.939 --> 12:33.462
The responsibility of your job, of photo interpretation, of looking at the targets, a big, big responsibility as far as the direction of the war and the health and the livelihood of those who were in direct combat.

12:33.642 --> 12:34.463
That's correct.

12:34.483 --> 12:36.726
Yeah, very, very interesting and very helpful effort.

12:37.415 --> 12:46.014
Intelligence, as you well know, has been in the limelight here in recent years that we don't have good intelligence and so forth.

12:46.034 --> 12:48.079
But it's not that we don't have good intelligence.

12:48.099 --> 12:50.243
It's we don't have the right intelligence.

12:50.263 --> 12:56.858
We need to have human intelligence out in the field, out behind the lines.

12:57.158 --> 13:03.644
This other intelligence that I operated with was mainly technological intelligence and interpretation.

13:03.684 --> 13:11.952
So it takes a little savvy to be able to interpret the right places and the right sites if you have it that way.

13:12.212 --> 13:21.541
The reason is if you misinterpret something and somebody doesn't catch it, you could actually cause B-52 or another airplane to go down.

13:22.582 --> 13:24.043
It does go through a lot of procedures.

13:24.143 --> 13:26.305
As I mentioned once before, I did a

13:27.128 --> 13:32.939
combat mission folder that I gave to the radar navigator of a B-52 that was getting in one of the cells.

13:32.959 --> 13:36.766
It was getting ready to fly into Vietnam.

13:37.367 --> 13:40.693
And I had made a mistake in my plotting.

13:40.714 --> 13:48.428
I had actually misplotted the PIP point, which is the pre-initial point, and the IP point, which is the initial point before the target.

13:49.252 --> 13:51.937
which obviously took them into a different area.

13:51.957 --> 14:00.494
But thanks to the radar navigator, he reviewed the charts and found out that there was a mistake there and made the corrections before they actually got to that area.

14:00.514 --> 14:01.676
But you never know.

14:02.117 --> 14:08.610
You feel bad and you wonder sometimes about some of these B-52 pilots and crew that did not make it back.

14:09.265 --> 14:14.374
Because once you got hit by a SAM or something like that, those airplanes just disintegrate.

14:15.316 --> 14:20.846
And sometimes your conscience bothers you because you don't know whether you had something, contributed something to that happening.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.473
So I mean, that's the nature of war.

14:24.757 --> 14:25.938
It's still bothersome.

14:26.339 --> 14:28.201
Something that stays with you, certainly.

14:28.241 --> 14:29.502
Let's talk about the VFW.

14:29.522 --> 14:34.268
VFW 4692, right here in Bryan, out on 2818.

14:34.368 --> 14:35.449
And you are the commander.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.653
Talk about the responsibility of the commander of the VFW post.

14:38.773 --> 14:39.554
Oh, well, shoot.

14:40.154 --> 14:45.861
The commander, to me, is like the President of the United States, if I may use that analogy.

14:47.162 --> 14:53.329
The VFW commander is really the focal point of all programs, all activities that take place

14:53.579 --> 14:59.609
And he is the sole person that is responsible for any action and consequences that may occur in the post.

14:59.629 --> 15:02.733
He's sort of the guide, the leader of the post.

15:02.773 --> 15:08.923
You have organizations under you, auxiliaries and so forth, that work with you.

15:09.885 --> 15:13.450
And sometimes they work by themselves, but with the approval of the commander.

15:14.011 --> 15:18.979
So a lot of programs that we do for the community have to be

15:19.600 --> 15:26.269
structured in such a way that they flow easily from one week to the next and so forth.

15:27.431 --> 15:31.897
That responsibility is humongous.

15:32.238 --> 15:34.000
I have to write a newsletter once a month.

15:34.921 --> 15:38.366
I have to make sure the security system's working so nobody breaks in.

15:38.386 --> 15:41.631
If they do, I have to check and find out if they caught them and who they were.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.616
That's besides the programs that we carry on out.

15:45.636 --> 15:49.101
We carry programs for the VFW that range

15:49.739 --> 15:55.546
from Buddy Poppy orders, which we usually do on Memorial Day weekend coming up.

15:56.547 --> 16:00.332
And this generates donations to the post.

16:01.073 --> 16:14.609
And the Buddy Poppies, if people don't know the history behind them, originated back around World War I by a Colonel McRae from Canada who was in Flanders Fields in Belgium during that war.

16:14.629 --> 16:19.054
And he was laying on the ground where he saw Buddy Poppies growing.

16:19.507 --> 16:21.369
wrote that poem in Flanders Fields.

16:22.431 --> 16:24.754
And it's caught on.

16:24.774 --> 16:37.930
And so now the tradition, it was adopted first by any, before anybody else adopted it, it was adopted by the VFW as a memento or a token of the sacrifice that these veterans did.

16:37.951 --> 16:44.098
And so consequently what's going on now, we carried on that tradition and some other organizations are doing the same thing.

16:44.118 --> 16:46.982
And we pass these out for donations that

16:47.468 --> 16:49.431
The post doesn't necessarily keep.

16:49.592 --> 16:57.987
They go to disabled veterans and orphaned widows, I mean orphaned children of disabled veterans.

16:58.568 --> 16:59.550
This money goes out.

17:00.030 --> 17:01.032
It doesn't stay.

17:01.052 --> 17:04.378
Some of it stays in the community, all of the community here.

17:04.438 --> 17:05.460
It does not go out of state.

17:06.031 --> 17:25.464
So when we do those runs at the convenience stores or at the big supermarkets or HEBs or whatever, we actually are really doing that in the heat of the day sometimes or be it raining, but we do it religiously on Memorial Day weekend.

17:25.484 --> 17:30.132
So we have people that volunteer not only from our post but also

17:30.517 --> 17:34.263
from Boy Scouts, some of the Boy Scouts come out and help us.

17:34.283 --> 17:38.149
And we set them in different locations and they work all day long.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.212
Then they bring the money and we count it.

17:40.252 --> 17:43.337
And we had a very successful Buddy Poppy run last year.

17:43.357 --> 17:44.519
We hope to do that this year.

17:44.860 --> 17:45.200
Indeed.

17:45.921 --> 17:50.128
The local VFW posts, I know you have activities really throughout the year on the special days

17:50.429 --> 17:53.194
that are made for veterans, so to speak, July 4th, Veterans Day.

17:53.234 --> 17:55.860
You talked about Buddy Poppy Day on Memorial Day.

17:56.160 --> 18:01.370
This is a very active post in Bryan College Station, probably more active than most.

18:01.390 --> 18:02.272
Yes, very much so.

18:02.693 --> 18:07.442
There is not a holiday or a traditional event that marks veterans

18:07.793 --> 18:10.437
occasions that we don't participate in.

18:10.457 --> 18:23.116
As was mentioned earlier, we actually do the Voice of Democracy, which involves high school kids, and we put them in competition with the post and then with district level, and they go to regional and maybe national.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.899
We do the same thing with the Patriot's Pen.

18:25.660 --> 18:33.872
We contact all the junior high schools, middle schools, and that involves that level, and that is an essay that is written.

18:33.892 --> 18:35.775
They have strict guidelines they have to follow.

18:36.363 --> 18:40.328
We also have other competitions that we do.

18:40.869 --> 18:57.611
We actually have people that go out and try to recruit members at the malls and by mail or by telephone or whatever to try to retain some of the continuous members that have not paid their dues.

18:57.631 --> 19:00.295
Or at the same time, we try to recruit new members

19:00.832 --> 19:12.546
And the aim here is, in my case, is to try to recruit the young members that are serving the armed forces now, the ones that are overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq and that were in Desert Storm.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.788
This is the future, though.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.111
They are the future of the VFW.

19:17.131 --> 19:24.139
As you may well know, there's about 1,000-plus World War II veterans that pass on every month.

19:24.710 --> 19:29.115
And at that rate, we're not going to have many veterans left.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.319
Eventually, we have to pass a torch on to these younger people.

19:32.339 --> 19:37.105
But the challenge there is how do you retain them once you get them in?

19:37.585 --> 19:39.568
What can you offer them?

19:39.588 --> 19:48.959
Not necessarily that you can offer them financial this and that satisfaction, but you can get them involved in projects, get their families involved.

19:48.979 --> 19:52.303
Because most of these guys and ladies that come back from the service,

19:52.925 --> 19:57.451
They don't want to just go to the VFW and sit in meetings and have a lunch meal or whatever.

19:57.771 --> 20:00.014
They want to actually cooperate.

20:00.034 --> 20:01.716
And there are so many projects they can do that.

20:01.737 --> 20:04.560
They can speak at elementary schools, at high schools.

20:05.021 --> 20:06.423
They can do flag etiquette.

20:06.443 --> 20:08.225
They can talk about their experiences.

20:09.627 --> 20:14.313
They can actually sit with some of the older veterans and find out what they went through.

20:15.074 --> 20:19.440
So it's a challenging task to try to accomplish this.

20:20.821 --> 20:22.003
There are other things we do.

20:22.405 --> 20:27.071
We donate blood to the armed forces.

20:27.231 --> 20:30.436
And this goes directly to the troops overseas.

20:30.456 --> 20:32.559
We've adopted two units in the area.

20:32.579 --> 20:38.587
We've adopted the 420th Engineering Brigade and the National Guard.

20:38.607 --> 20:40.870
And these guys have been deployed already.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.173
What we do is we contact the commanders.

20:43.613 --> 20:49.341
We pick up goodies for them, magazines, books, toiletries, things they might need in the field.

20:49.979 --> 20:54.045
Phone cards, Operation Uplink, where they can call home.

20:54.065 --> 20:56.449
We do this, and they have it shipped out.

20:57.010 --> 20:58.512
So we never lose track of that.

20:58.532 --> 21:12.373
Plus, we always keep in touch with the commanders of these units in case the family members that are left behind might need some assistance, possibly maybe mowing the lawn or having something moved or whatever, a helping hand.

21:12.393 --> 21:13.455
We're there to help them.

21:13.688 --> 21:15.851
So we've got that going.

21:15.871 --> 21:20.077
We also have a competition right now going.

21:20.117 --> 21:22.020
It's called the Air Rifle Team.

21:22.040 --> 21:30.652
The Air Rifle Team consists of boys and girls, 7 to 19, that meet at the post at 10 o'clock, the third Saturday every month.

21:31.092 --> 21:36.260
We provide the air rifles, the pellets, the CO2 cartridges, the goggles.

21:36.520 --> 21:41.367
And we have a trained, used to be a Marine sniper, that trains these kids.

21:41.687 --> 21:42.328
And it's all free.

21:42.865 --> 21:45.851
So anybody in the community that wants to do this can do it.

21:46.152 --> 21:58.817
All you have to do is come by at 10 o'clock on the third Saturday, get involved, and eventually when we build a team, we'll go over and beat the heck out of Conroe because they were the first ones to have an air show, an air rifle show.

21:58.837 --> 22:03.186
So eventually this will grow to the point where it will be regional in nature and then statewide.

22:03.638 --> 22:10.430
Obviously, the VFW is a lot more than just a whole bunch of guys getting together, having a few beers, playing a little bit of pool, and exchanging stories.

22:11.412 --> 22:14.558
You all are super active, and I don't want to get you in trouble.

22:14.578 --> 22:20.629
The Ladies Auxiliary with the VFW, another very active group that's really a big supporter of you all.

22:20.649 --> 22:21.350
Exactly.

22:21.371 --> 22:23.615
We could not function without the Ladies Auxiliary.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.478
Ladies Auxiliary...

22:25.880 --> 22:29.025
Those ladies will prepare foods, they'll prepare meals.

22:29.126 --> 22:35.337
We've got an Easter egg hunt coming up on March 17th there at the Post.

22:35.677 --> 22:39.424
They prepare, they plan for the Christmas parties.

22:39.444 --> 22:44.012
They prepare for the meals that we have after our general meetings once a month.

22:45.033 --> 22:50.503
And besides that, they help work with us on the Voice of Democracy and Patriots plan.

22:50.855 --> 22:54.860
So they are active, and without them, there is no way we could function.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.123
We've also got another auxiliary.

22:57.143 --> 23:09.558
It's called the Military Order of the Cooties and the Military Order of the Cooties Auxiliary, which basically consists of what they consider the active workers of the post.

23:10.019 --> 23:11.441
It's a privilege to be in that order.

23:12.762 --> 23:15.966
And these people actually go out to the nursing homes.

23:16.927 --> 23:18.229
They work bingo with them.

23:18.513 --> 23:20.196
They take them gifts.

23:20.496 --> 23:21.518
They take them food.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.043
They spend a few hours with them.

23:24.383 --> 23:25.605
And they go to Sheridan.

23:25.625 --> 23:26.747
They go to Crestview.

23:26.807 --> 23:29.552
They go to different places, local places.

23:29.572 --> 23:31.816
And that is always a moving, moving thing they do.

23:31.836 --> 23:34.621
They go visit the veterans in hospitals.

23:34.641 --> 23:37.646
And so that's a good organization, a good auxiliary of the post.

23:37.666 --> 23:42.394
So everybody, all the auxiliaries have something to do with the community.

23:42.712 --> 23:50.362
And that is really the aim that we shoot for, is we're here to serve this community, College Station and Bryan and the surrounding towns.

23:51.002 --> 23:52.244
We're visiting with Rick Olivares.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.087
He's the commander of the VFW Post 4692.

23:56.129 --> 23:58.071
Real quick, Rick, we have just a few minutes.

23:58.912 --> 24:04.459
In retirement, you're a Spanish teacher at the Brazos School for Inquiry and Creativity out on Old Hearn Road.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.762
Talk a little bit about that school and what you do every day.

24:07.062 --> 24:08.504
Well, I do a lot now.

24:08.744 --> 24:19.500
When I started out there, I started working as a part-time instructor, and I was only working from 8 o'clock until 1230, which was great, because that meant some time off in the afternoons.

24:20.581 --> 24:28.994
But as a need arose, they asked me if I could teach not only my Spanish classes, which I taught three of, but if I could teach biology.

24:29.014 --> 24:31.557
And of course, being a biochemist, that's exactly what I did.

24:31.597 --> 24:33.520
I said, yeah, I can teach biology.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.985
The next thing came up, they said, well, we need a chemistry teacher.

24:37.403 --> 24:38.264
Can you teach chemistry?

24:38.304 --> 24:39.826
I said, yeah, I can teach chemistry.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.488
So here I am doing that.

24:41.508 --> 24:44.352
Then they came up and said, we need somebody to teach environmental science.

24:44.392 --> 24:45.093
Can you teach that?

24:45.774 --> 24:46.135
Yeah.

24:46.255 --> 24:50.701
So here I am doing biology, chemistry, environmental science, Spanish.

24:51.021 --> 24:52.303
Oh, and I forgot mathematics.

24:53.364 --> 25:00.053
So I am busy continuously with preparing different lesson plans for these classes.

25:00.455 --> 25:08.972
The school is a good place to be because it's kids that need a little individual coaching.

25:09.893 --> 25:20.995
We have not a very large campus, and therefore we have a very good ratio of students, teachers to students, and that makes it a lot easier to work with.

25:20.975 --> 25:22.117
I know you're proud to be there.

25:22.457 --> 25:23.599
Rick, you're a Vietnam vet.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.623
A lot of folks came back from Vietnam.

25:25.643 --> 25:27.105
It was not the most popular war.

25:27.165 --> 25:30.851
It's still not regarded as the most popular war.

25:31.072 --> 25:39.045
As a Vietnam veteran, now, as you look at it these many, many years later, I know your pride at serving there is immense.

25:39.165 --> 25:41.970
Talk a little bit about your thoughts about being a veteran.

25:42.203 --> 25:44.265
of an American veteran and a Vietnam veteran.

25:44.786 --> 26:02.207
Well, it's a good point you brought up because when I first got out of the service in 72, after being overseas from 68 to almost 69, 70, I felt, you know, you'd see all these war protesters and going on and protesting going on in the United States.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.771
And that didn't really help the morale of the soldiers and the troops over there.

26:06.532 --> 26:10.557
But really, when you came home, that's when you felt not wanted.

26:10.942 --> 26:14.506
And from other veterans that I've talked to, they got spat on and so forth.

26:15.287 --> 26:20.293
I didn't get spat on, but I sure had my faces turned away from me a lot of times.

26:21.074 --> 26:28.363
And some of them even got labeled as child killers and so forth.

26:29.184 --> 26:33.149
And for that reason, I didn't want to join the VFW.

26:33.169 --> 26:37.234
In fact, I did not join the VFW for almost 20 years after I got out of the service.

26:37.274 --> 26:40.898
I didn't want to be associated with anything military that would put a stigma

26:41.283 --> 26:42.825
and the fact that I was a Vietnam veteran.

26:43.686 --> 26:51.996
But eventually, I guess my thoughts and my feelings mellowed after I saw what good things the VFW accomplishes, and the bug bit, so to speak.

26:52.656 --> 27:05.432
And ever since I've been with the VFW as a junior commander and a senior vice commander, now to commander, and also junior vice commander for the District 17, the bug's bitten.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.797
I want to get involved, and I want to do things, because it does make a difference.

27:09.817 --> 27:10.918
And I recommend that we get

27:11.152 --> 27:15.378
all the people that are coming back from Iraq to come out and join the VFW.

27:15.398 --> 27:15.919
All right.

27:15.939 --> 27:18.142
Rick Olivares, thank you very much for being with us.

27:18.163 --> 27:19.164
Thank you very much, Tom.

27:19.184 --> 27:28.558
I want to mention also the VFW post, 4692, is one of the gathering spots for our veterans of the Brazos Valley, but also the American Legion post, 159.

27:29.039 --> 27:31.202
Very large membership for both of these.

27:31.537 --> 27:36.304
And they meet, and that's how we bring our veterans to you each week.

27:36.324 --> 27:39.669
Thank you again, Rick Olivares, VFW Post Commander 4692.

27:39.909 --> 27:43.154
The Brazos Valley salutes you and all veterans.

27:43.174 --> 27:49.843
And please be sure, the next chance you get, be sure to go out and thank a vet for all that he has done for us to make us free.

27:50.104 --> 27:51.325
Thank a vet today, won't you?

27:51.866 --> 27:54.009
For Rick Olivares, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:54.029 --> 27:55.291
Won't you join us next time?

27:55.672 --> 27:56.593
Thank you for watching.

27:56.953 --> 27:58.135
This is Veterans of the Valley.
