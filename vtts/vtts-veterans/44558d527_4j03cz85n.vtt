local decision-making and accessibility as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
[Music.]

00:19.000 --> 00:34.000
[Music.]

00:35.486 --> 00:38.536
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.098
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.200 --> 00:48.430
Once you hear the story of College Station's Ken Loveless, you will say it's a miracle that he's here to tell us the story at all.

00:48.931 --> 00:58.084
Colonel Loveless flew choppers in Vietnam, attacked helicopters, and he can count at least five times in his career that he's crashed, the first time he should not have survived.

00:58.317 --> 01:02.804
A helicopter pilot for General Westmoreland and General Abrams in Vietnam.

01:02.824 --> 01:05.387
His story of service is indeed an amazing one to hear.

01:05.828 --> 01:09.113
And we welcome Colonel Ken Loveless to Veterans of the Valley.

01:09.133 --> 01:10.495
It's a pleasure to have you here, Ken.

01:10.515 --> 01:10.775
Thank you.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.378
And thank you for your service, first off.

01:12.678 --> 01:13.500
Let's go back early.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.504
You were very young when you entered military service.

01:16.544 --> 01:21.912
Matter of fact, you were in high school, actually, when you joined the 143rd Infantry Regiment.

01:22.043 --> 01:22.924
Talk about growing up.

01:23.204 --> 01:25.006
You grew up near Waco.

01:25.026 --> 01:28.190
But you came to San Antonio when your dad was wounded in World War II.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.572
Sort of talk about the early years.

01:29.972 --> 01:30.733
The early years.

01:31.013 --> 01:38.863
I grew up on a farm actually west of Amarillo, about 60 miles west, very close to the New Mexico-Texas line.

01:39.824 --> 01:48.574
And while there during the war, during the Second World War, the Army Air Corps often would land at a

01:49.162 --> 01:55.350
farmer's field about a mile, mile and a half from my grandparents' home.

01:55.370 --> 02:01.197
I was being reared by my grandparents until I was, well through the farmative years until I was about six.

02:02.218 --> 02:11.490
And watching the airplanes come in and land, the army had actually leased a bit of the property to the government

02:12.112 --> 02:26.071
And this property was used in part of the training, navigation training, cross-country training for the Army Air Corps that I believe for the most part were based out of the Lubbock area.

02:27.513 --> 02:31.779
Any chance I had, I would go down to the field where they landed.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.423
I'd get my granddad to take me down or my grandmother.

02:34.910 --> 02:41.118
And I would meet the pilots, and they would let me sit in the airplane and play with the instruments and whatever.

02:41.618 --> 02:46.624
So I think that really started my sincere appreciation for aviation.

02:47.245 --> 03:02.824
And then when I was about six years old, my sister and I left the farm and went to San Antonio, Texas to be with my mother and my dad in San Antonio again.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.944
was nothing but aviation.

03:05.485 --> 03:10.310
It was Kelly, Air Force Base, Randolph, Lackland Air Force Base.

03:10.890 --> 03:15.756
So just about any time of the day, you could look up and see an airplane.

03:15.776 --> 03:20.421
And I, in my mind, decided that would be a great thing to do.

03:21.642 --> 03:29.110
And then when we left San Antonio to go to Waco, there was James Conley Air Force Base.

03:29.130 --> 03:32.794
Again, aircraft in the air most of the day.

03:34.310 --> 03:42.181
And there at Waco, I attended a university high school.

03:43.322 --> 03:47.688
And while there, I worked actually half the day.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.531
I went to school from 8 to 12.

03:50.111 --> 03:55.959
Then I went to my job in downtown Waco at Hill Printing and Stationery Company at 1 o'clock.

03:55.979 --> 03:59.184
And I'd work till 5 or 6.

03:59.905 --> 04:03.169
And did that five days a week plus some Saturday mornings.

04:03.706 --> 04:17.005
And when it was time for me to graduate from high school, I had no plans at all of going into the military at that time.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.148
I really didn't know how.

04:19.168 --> 04:29.202
I had joined the National Guard, as you mentioned, the 143rd Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division, Texas National Guard.

04:30.023 --> 04:31.806
So it gave me a little appreciation

04:32.292 --> 04:43.163
I think I learned a lot, especially a lot about officers and non-coms and soldiers while being in the National Guard.

04:45.005 --> 04:53.493
I actually, as I said, didn't intend at all to go into the military.

04:53.513 --> 05:01.641
I was quite pleased with the National Guard, but I would stand there at my

05:01.992 --> 05:07.738
printing press day after day, sweating.

05:07.798 --> 05:09.921
It was so hot in there you couldn't.

05:10.241 --> 05:13.384
We didn't have air conditioning in the printing shops.

05:15.146 --> 05:16.468
And I was on the second floor.

05:16.488 --> 05:22.574
I would look down and I would see same cars Monday through Friday going and coming from work.

05:22.594 --> 05:25.958
And I would have to listen to the older men

05:26.917 --> 05:35.026
in the shop always griping about if they had only stayed in the Navy, if they had only stayed in the Army.

05:35.046 --> 05:42.855
You know, over and over, I would have been retired last year or I would be retiring this month if I had just stayed in the military.

05:42.875 --> 05:56.130
Well, I was thinking about staying in the printing business and having to stand there and listen to that the rest of my life and see those same cars going to and from work that

05:56.701 --> 06:00.387
Something in my mind told me I ought to get out of the printing business.

06:01.469 --> 06:04.714
And I had a friend.

06:06.517 --> 06:09.081
We were out driving around town one night.

06:10.163 --> 06:15.091
He had gone to North Texas State and had made poor grades.

06:15.171 --> 06:21.441
And so in those days, you had to lay out one semester before you could go back to school.

06:21.461 --> 06:23.805
And while we were driving around one night,

06:25.034 --> 06:29.118
He said, Ken, Sunday I'm going back up to North Texas, back up to Denton.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.460
Why don't you come with me?

06:31.480 --> 06:34.163
And I said, well, I don't know about that.

06:34.223 --> 06:36.985
He said, well, you've got some money saved up.

06:37.045 --> 06:39.608
Yeah, I've got some money saved up.

06:39.628 --> 06:41.750
He said, well, come on and let's go.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.271
Well, I took him up on it.

06:44.412 --> 06:54.602
I went to Denton, knew nothing about the school, knew nothing about going to college, nor had I taken any of the prep high school

06:55.004 --> 07:22.783
courses you're supposed to take. Nor had I taken any tests. I knew nothing about it, but I was there. So we went into a like a gymnasium and they had card tables all around the walls. Again you got to keep in mind there were no computers in those days. Everything was stubby pencil, you know, and I just got in line with everybody else. I had my checkbook. Just like I said, I

07:23.000 --> 07:26.665
saved the money up from working through high school.

07:26.685 --> 07:30.390
And I would sign up for classes that I thought I should sign up for.

07:32.072 --> 07:33.273
And a few electives.

07:33.293 --> 07:35.616
I got to the end of all the tables.

07:35.636 --> 07:37.078
And that's where you paid your money.

07:37.098 --> 07:38.660
So I wrote a check.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.383
And that was all I went to class.

07:43.206 --> 07:44.368
One semester went by.

07:44.408 --> 07:45.289
I did very well.

07:46.431 --> 07:51.437
I had gone into the Air Force ROTC there.

07:52.902 --> 08:02.391
And one day during the first or the second semester, I had a note from the dean of men.

08:02.411 --> 08:06.075
Report to him Saturday at whatever time.

08:06.095 --> 08:06.736
I don't remember.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.517
And I did.

08:08.537 --> 08:10.820
I found out where his office was.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.362
I came in and reported to him.

08:13.382 --> 08:16.405
And he said, who are you?

08:17.446 --> 08:19.348
I said, well, I'm Ken Loveless.

08:20.054 --> 08:21.896
He said, I know that, but who are you?

08:21.916 --> 08:22.897
How did you get here?

08:23.799 --> 08:25.821
I said, well, I just got in a car and drove up here.

08:26.682 --> 08:28.104
Well, how did you get in school?

08:28.284 --> 08:31.608
I said, well, I stood in line, paid my money, and I was in.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.733
Well, he said, you can't do that.

08:35.753 --> 08:42.782
He said, you're going to have to take the courses necessary, and you'll do that next Saturday.

08:43.963 --> 08:48.829
It'll take you about four hours to take the test, one's math and English and whatever.

08:49.906 --> 08:52.869
Report to building so-and-so at 8 o'clock in the morning.

08:52.949 --> 08:53.369
I did.

08:54.891 --> 08:55.711
Took the test.

08:56.012 --> 08:58.274
Went on about my business.

08:58.294 --> 09:00.275
And to this day, I've never heard another word.

09:01.136 --> 09:05.000
I think they had to fulfill a state requirement of some sort.

09:05.020 --> 09:09.524
So I have no idea what grades I made or whatever.

09:10.405 --> 09:17.331
And thank goodness it worked out because I couldn't work in Denton.

09:18.121 --> 09:25.789
You had the North Texas State on one side of town, University of Texas for women on the other, and there were no jobs.

09:25.809 --> 09:26.629
And I had to work.

09:27.530 --> 09:41.644
And so an opportunity came for me to go to West Texas, to Canyon, Texas, West Texas State, where work was plentiful.

09:41.845 --> 09:44.247
You wouldn't think so, being a small town of Canyon.

09:44.902 --> 09:48.827
But Amarillo was 17 miles away, and there were many jobs there.

09:48.867 --> 09:51.650
Plus, I knew how to run a printing press.

09:52.871 --> 10:02.883
And as such, I got a job on the campus with the college press, running the press.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.468
Whenever I wasn't in school, I could go work printing.

10:07.068 --> 10:12.715
And then in the evenings, I pumped gas at the local Phillips 66 station.

10:13.066 --> 10:14.931
You graduated from West Texas State.

10:15.011 --> 10:17.378
I want to get you into the military here.

10:17.418 --> 10:28.088
In 1961, you graduated from West Texas State and you got your commission after that and you went to Fort Benning for infantry officer basic course where you got your parachute rating at that time.

10:28.068 --> 10:33.559
Sort of take us from there and let's get us into the military.

10:33.640 --> 10:33.980
All right.

10:34.321 --> 10:34.742
Okay.

10:34.762 --> 10:36.486
Let's say we've been to Fort Benning.

10:36.506 --> 10:37.969
Okay.

10:37.989 --> 10:43.139
Been to the, we call it the Benning School for Boys, the infantry basic course.

10:44.242 --> 10:47.308
And then I had orders for airborne school.

10:48.183 --> 10:59.020
followed by orders to go to the Army Helicopter School in Fort Walters, Texas at Brinnell Wells.

10:59.040 --> 10:59.802
Brinnell Wells, right.

11:01.304 --> 11:10.379
And while there, I actually really took to flying.

11:10.399 --> 11:15.507
It was just second nature and I just thoroughly enjoyed it.

11:16.263 --> 11:24.251
Every morning, and this was during the December, January time frame, every morning the students would take a number.

11:24.291 --> 11:28.856
They'd bring the numbers, the tail boom numbers, the numbers of the aircraft, and put them on a chalkboard.

11:29.557 --> 11:33.261
And then when they got to your name, that is the aircraft that was assigned to you.

11:33.441 --> 11:38.186
And then you would go out from the building to the flight line to that aircraft.

11:38.226 --> 11:39.808
Well, I went out that particular morning.

11:40.248 --> 11:41.950
Me and one other person was.

11:42.470 --> 11:45.735
waiting for our airplanes, for our helicopters.

11:46.696 --> 11:47.978
I went to the helicopter.

11:49.340 --> 11:52.224
It was absolutely beautiful, clean, immaculate.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.147
I said, this is the best one I've seen.

11:54.327 --> 12:05.224
Well, I got in, cranked it up, hovered out to the takeoff pad on the heliport, cleared the takeoff.

12:05.985 --> 12:10.992
I took off, and we have in the helicopter business an area.

12:11.579 --> 12:12.941
It's called Dead Bend's Curve.

12:14.182 --> 12:18.027
That's between about 15 feet or so and 200 feet.

12:18.707 --> 12:39.932
If you're on takeoff, pulling maximum power, you have no airspeed, yet you're climbing, if you have a complete engine failure within that perimeter, you're for sure going to tear the aircraft up because you can't get pitched down fast enough and get enough rotations on the blade

12:40.199 --> 12:42.823
to pull in and come to a soft spot.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.727
You just don't have enough altitude.

12:46.590 --> 12:56.206
And as I was taking off in that particular dead man's curve, the engine just blew up.

12:56.226 --> 12:59.252
It threw actually through two ride-in bearings.

12:59.272 --> 13:04.441
So two pistons of the six were ruined.

13:04.461 --> 13:05.903
The engine just exploded.

13:06.912 --> 13:11.737
And I had time to level the skids and pick a spot which was right straight in front of me.

13:11.777 --> 13:20.887
It was bearing no trees, but there was a highline cable wire that went through several of them.

13:20.907 --> 13:24.690
And I had to get over those.

13:24.710 --> 13:31.958
So as I approached them, this is all taking just moments.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.943
All I had time to do was get the picture on the bottom.

13:34.963 --> 13:36.545
I hollered May Day three times.

13:36.645 --> 13:38.267
I remember that on the way down.

13:39.068 --> 13:44.654
And then I had the perfect sight picture to cushion the aircraft and land.

13:45.134 --> 13:48.438
And suddenly the aircraft tipped over and went straight in.

13:49.299 --> 13:50.520
All I saw was brown.

13:51.481 --> 14:01.692
And the accident board determined that on that particular helicopter there was a little, we called it the pogo stick, but it protected the

14:02.178 --> 14:06.765
tail rotor from getting hit on the ground if you came in too steep.

14:07.566 --> 14:13.435
Well, that pogo stick hit one of the wires and tipped the helicopter on its nose.

14:14.497 --> 14:19.424
When it went in, it beat itself to death on the ground.

14:19.764 --> 14:31.442
It ended up on the right side, and I ended up, when I released myself from the seat belt and the harness, I fell over to on the right side looking

14:31.777 --> 14:39.084
straight up through the left door, and I said, well, I've got to gather my belongings.

14:39.124 --> 14:59.202
I saw my wallet, and I went to try to pull myself out of the aircraft, and it had a big broken hole in the front of the aircraft, the bubble, and I was going to crawl out, pull myself out of that hole, but

14:59.772 --> 15:14.327
With my legs up in the air over the console of the helicopter, and I'm on my back, and I go to try to move, and my legs from the waist down, I was paralyzed.

15:14.407 --> 15:16.529
Couldn't feel a thing, couldn't do anything with it.

15:17.570 --> 15:24.497
And about that time, I heard a crackling sound, followed momentarily by smoke.

15:25.338 --> 15:29.243
And I knew then I had a full load of fuel on the helicopter.

15:29.323 --> 15:32.487
I knew then what had happened.

15:33.829 --> 15:35.191
And I knew I had to get out of there.

15:35.892 --> 15:36.472
But I couldn't.

15:37.774 --> 15:46.546
So after, might have been moments, but it seemed to me like an eternity, I was looking at the clear blue winter sky.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.109
It was a cold day.

15:49.129 --> 15:53.775
And suddenly I heard someone say, we've got to get out of here.

15:54.447 --> 15:55.588
It's going to explode.

15:56.249 --> 16:00.134
And I looked, and a man was crawling into the front of the helicopter.

16:00.715 --> 16:05.080
He grabbed me by my shoulders, pulled me out of the helicopter.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.442
And of course, I was dead weight.

16:06.462 --> 16:07.603
I couldn't get on my feet.

16:08.905 --> 16:10.967
So he tucked his head under my arm.

16:11.728 --> 16:16.614
And we got out about 10 yards, and we both fell down.

16:16.634 --> 16:21.720
And at that time, the helicopter did, in fact, burst into flames.

16:22.072 --> 16:23.354
did a pretty good job on it.

16:23.394 --> 16:24.736
It burned it up.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.419
And it did.

16:26.639 --> 16:44.347
My fear was further endorsed by having to be picked up by a helicopter and put in a litter that was strapped to the cross tubes of the helicopter, the landing gear of the helicopter.

16:44.868 --> 16:50.256
They flew me to the hospital with me laying outside strapped to a litter.

16:50.725 --> 16:56.715
looking straight up into the blades of another helicopter identical to the one that I had been flying.

16:56.995 --> 16:58.678
That's how I got to the hospital.

16:58.698 --> 17:06.331
But it did bum me up a little bit and set me back a couple of classes before I could get well enough.

17:08.635 --> 17:12.902
There's some damage to my back and my left leg and my teeth.

17:13.287 --> 17:16.279
I ate part of the helmet, I think, when we crashed.

17:17.725 --> 17:18.910
But that was the end of that.

17:18.990 --> 17:22.183
I did make it through it.

17:23.564 --> 17:28.009
Went on to continue school in a later class.

17:28.089 --> 17:28.490
Right.

17:28.510 --> 17:33.796
After flight school, you had orders to Fort Bragg in your first duty as a lieutenant.

17:34.357 --> 17:44.689
And talk a little bit about, this is before we were to Vietnam, and a situation where you had duty in Oxford, Mississippi.

17:44.709 --> 17:45.369
Yes.

17:45.449 --> 17:46.411
Go ahead, talk about that story.

17:46.431 --> 17:52.778
In those days, in the 1962, three, four, we had...

17:53.467 --> 18:22.056
quite a few problems across the country with, as you know, most places where there was in school and in lunch counters and all because of segregation, there were very tough times on the part of those people who were involved by that being the military,

18:22.255 --> 18:26.901
being the civilians, being the city governments.

18:28.083 --> 18:51.013
And one of those times had to do, that I got personally involved over, there was actually two of them, one in Greensboro, North Carolina, but this particular one was in Knoxville, Mississippi, where an ex-Air Force sergeant had enrolled at Ole Miss

18:51.837 --> 18:54.200
And again, Ole Miss was segregated.

18:55.542 --> 19:00.509
And things did not go well there for him, as you all might imagine.

19:02.491 --> 19:14.107
There were federal marshals who were there to protect him, to accompany him to class and from class back to his living area.

19:15.509 --> 19:20.275
And the Army was there to protect the federal marshals.

19:21.183 --> 19:34.821
because there were problems with things being thrown at him and the federal marshals whenever he would try to move about on campus.

19:34.841 --> 19:43.713
We had an aviation detachment there, and I was sent from Fort Bragg, for me, down to be the aviation officer.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.578
I had several helicopters, several airplanes,

19:48.082 --> 19:54.671
And my pilots lived on the airfield outside of Oxford.

19:55.732 --> 20:03.302
And the rest of us guys, we lived over on a farmer's pig farm, actually.

20:04.203 --> 20:10.091
It was called the USAFOX Command, United States Armed Forces, Oxford.

20:10.111 --> 20:13.896
And that was quite an eye-opener for me.

20:13.916 --> 20:14.817
I learned a lot.

20:16.019 --> 20:17.481
It was a terrible assignment.

20:17.731 --> 20:21.234
as far as that goes, but it was very educational.

20:22.195 --> 20:25.919
It rained there, of course, all that time, and we had to live in tents.

20:26.019 --> 20:31.283
We could not stay in motels or in buildings or hotels or anywhere.

20:32.625 --> 20:33.886
We couldn't go into town.

20:35.287 --> 20:36.488
You couldn't buy anything.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.709
You couldn't get a haircut.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.711
You couldn't do anything in town.

20:39.731 --> 20:46.017
So we just kind of lived on our own out there, and all of our trash and all went to the pig farm, and he was happy.

20:46.148 --> 20:52.594
But that was a real interesting time.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.156
And I'll tell you something related to that.

20:54.196 --> 21:04.806
When I went to leave Fayetteville, North Carolina to go to Oxford, there was an airline in those days called Piedmont.

21:04.826 --> 21:11.613
And the aircraft went from Fayetteville to Memphis, Tennessee.

21:12.294 --> 21:15.717
And then I was supposed to catch another flight from there down to Oxford.

21:17.654 --> 21:22.619
And when I got on the airplane to leave, we had to always wear our uniform.

21:22.939 --> 21:29.725
Any time in those days when the military traveled, and you weren't paying for it, in other words, you were supposed to be in uniform.

21:29.745 --> 21:41.816
So I had on my uniform, and I sat down in the seat, and the airplane started to roll for taking off, and then suddenly the brakes went on, and it came to a stop.

21:41.836 --> 21:45.720
And then over to the PA system, it says, is there a Lieutenant Loveless on board?

21:46.443 --> 21:47.845
And I said, oh, my gosh.

21:47.865 --> 21:51.288
You know, a stewardess came and got me.

21:51.308 --> 21:56.834
And what happened is I'd run off with the car keys, and my wife couldn't get away from the airport.

21:56.854 --> 21:58.676
Now, that would never happen today.

21:58.697 --> 22:04.423
They wouldn't stop an airplane on takeoff for me to go up front and throw the keys out of the pilot's window.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.907
But I've never forgot that.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.448
It was really hilarious.

22:09.508 --> 22:16.416
And, of course, the people on the airplane made me the butt of jokes after that.

22:16.649 --> 22:25.638
I want to go to some photographs here real quick that you have supplied us from your home also that'll show some of your awards and everything.

22:26.399 --> 22:27.220
You can see right there.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.802
Talk about what that picture is.

22:29.903 --> 22:34.067
I was the commander of the 162nd assault helicopter company.

22:34.087 --> 22:37.150
We flew out of Kanto, South Vietnam.

22:38.111 --> 22:41.695
And I'm standing there in front of one of the UH-1 Hueys.

22:42.890 --> 22:59.194
We had different types of Hueys, really a different type just meant you had a better, bigger engine or some configured for guns, some configured for slicks, which were the type of helicopter that took the troops on combat assault.

23:00.616 --> 23:12.373
And we parked them in revetments, those are sandbags with steel supporting them, and that's to protect them when the mortars, when we would get rockets or mortars in.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.608
on the field.

23:14.628 --> 23:22.138
And that's just an actual pose shot of me in front of my helicopter.

23:22.158 --> 23:23.299
Okay, let's move on to the next one.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.101
This is in your home.

23:25.121 --> 23:26.323
These are some patches.

23:27.604 --> 23:41.702
We can just say that from the top left to the bottom right, that sort of covers your career as far as the patches that you wore in the military from the Texas National Guard up at the top left

23:42.070 --> 23:44.673
all the way to the bottom right.

23:44.693 --> 23:46.655
Let's move on to the next photograph.

23:48.738 --> 24:09.782
Highly decorated soldiers, some of the medals that Colonel Loveless won, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal with 26 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Commendation Medal.

24:09.762 --> 24:25.648
with three oak leaf clusters, Air Force Combat Readiness Medal, National Defense Service Medals, and, of course, the Korea Defense Service Medal, and it just goes on and on and on, and we're almost running out of time for this show, but let's go on to the next show.

24:25.928 --> 24:26.750
Talk about this.

24:26.770 --> 24:29.294
This is the young and the old Ken Loveless.

24:29.314 --> 24:33.120
Before and after the shot on the left,

24:33.623 --> 24:35.305
This was during World War II.

24:35.605 --> 24:38.228
I might add, I was always fighting the Japanese.

24:39.309 --> 24:44.634
I never fought the Germans because my grandparents were of German stock.

24:44.675 --> 24:49.960
In fact, my great grandpa used to take me around the farm and have me speak German and learn.

24:50.521 --> 24:52.643
And I resisted that.

24:53.063 --> 24:57.468
But I've got my steel helmet on, a wooden rifle, and I've got a parachute.

24:57.488 --> 25:01.292
Now, at the end of the parachute was a cardboard box.

25:01.332 --> 25:03.394
My grandmother would pack my lunch in there.

25:04.083 --> 25:10.454
And I had a kit bag with gear in my left hand.

25:11.535 --> 25:16.504
But anyway, that's when I was, I'd go out and play for hours, throw that parachute up in the air and then run.

25:16.945 --> 25:18.728
So you were about how old in that picture?

25:18.748 --> 25:22.554
That was 40, 44, 43 or 44.

25:22.694 --> 25:26.060
So I would have been four or five years old.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.145
And then on the right,

25:29.277 --> 25:33.642
It was the side of me at the Airborne School at Fort Beans, Georgia.

25:33.923 --> 25:34.984
This is in your home.

25:35.385 --> 25:38.588
We're going to talk about this next show and what you flew in Vietnam.

25:38.608 --> 25:43.454
This is a print of the OH-6 helicopter that you, the attack helicopter.

25:43.474 --> 25:44.396
No, that's the UH-1B.

25:44.416 --> 25:44.976
That's the Huey.

25:45.116 --> 25:47.820
That's the Huey that we used for combat assaults.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.501
Right, right.

25:48.521 --> 25:51.244
And then there's, I found this in the book.

25:51.264 --> 25:53.046
This is three separate helicopters.

25:53.066 --> 25:57.732
This is the OH-6 in the foreground, the Huey in the middle, and then...

25:57.712 --> 25:59.775
I forgot the name of the helicopter.

25:59.795 --> 26:01.017
That's the Cobra on the third one.

26:01.037 --> 26:01.718
Yeah, on the far one.

26:01.958 --> 26:18.240
Just to give folks an idea of the three different helicopters that were in service, and the attack helicopter was the one in the foreground, the one that you... Well, the 086 was an observation type, but we did have a minigun, XM27 subsystem, which was like a Gatling gun.

26:18.360 --> 26:18.921
Right.

26:18.941 --> 26:25.390
And you can't see it here because it would be on the port side of the helicopter.

26:25.707 --> 26:30.314
And I also went down in one of those in Vietnam.

26:32.117 --> 26:37.425
I lost everything from the back of what looks like an egg back was gone.

26:37.445 --> 26:42.973
And I went in and did an art rotation.

26:43.223 --> 26:45.469
Well, in fact, a tail rotor hit me on the leg.

26:45.509 --> 26:46.292
It hit me on the knee.

26:46.312 --> 26:48.738
I had my knee out the door as it was going up in front of me.

26:49.460 --> 26:56.440
But that was really exciting because as soon as I stopped all forward airspeed and let it come down,

26:57.027 --> 26:58.831
I had no control of it after that.

26:58.991 --> 27:01.076
It hopped just like a rabbit would hop.

27:01.357 --> 27:05.145
It hopped to the left three times before I could shut the engine down.

27:05.165 --> 27:14.265
We're going to talk about your service in Vietnam and their memorable missions, and there definitely were, and we're going to do that on the next show because there's just not enough time and 30 minutes to tell your whole story.

27:14.285 --> 27:15.388
So we'll be back next week.

27:15.448 --> 27:16.791
Thank you for being here.

27:16.771 --> 27:22.742
You've probably guessed by now that Ken Loveless's story is one of those that can't be told in 30 minutes.

27:22.782 --> 27:33.823
So next week, we will continue hearing his story of service, the rest of his final Vietnam tour, being the Army Rep to the Royal College of Defense Studies and Battlestaff Commander at Silk Purse in England.

27:34.143 --> 27:36.147
We thank Ken Loveless for his service.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.149
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.315
Join Ken Loveless and me next week on Veterans of the Valley.

27:43.065 --> 27:53.742
[Music.]

27:54.000 --> 28:04.000
[Music.]

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
[Music.]

28:09.000 --> 28:20.980
[Silence.]

28:20.980 --> 28:25.219
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present,
