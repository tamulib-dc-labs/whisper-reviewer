00:21.530 --> 00:41.837
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:42.117 --> 00:43.839
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.064
Carl Huss joined the Army Air Corps before U.S.

00:47.124 --> 00:50.288
involvement in World War II started with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

00:50.723 --> 01:00.328
He was just looking to learn a trade, and indeed he did as a radio man, stationed first for nearly three years in Alaska, then in the Philippines near war's end.

01:00.646 --> 01:07.638
He became pretty well versed in American-Russian relations during the war, and that's just a part of a fascinating story of service.

01:07.658 --> 01:10.703
Please welcome, if you will, Carl Huss to Veterans of the Valley.

01:10.763 --> 01:12.506
Carl, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:13.007 --> 01:17.194
I love your story of service in World War II.

01:17.274 --> 01:23.885
Even though it didn't necessarily involve any combat, it was still a very interesting story, you as a radio man.

01:23.905 --> 01:24.286
Let's start.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.670
You grew up in Oklahoma in the Depression.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.224
You wanted a career job.

01:29.264 --> 01:32.640
Right after you graduated from high school, you were in the Army in 1940, right?

01:32.961 --> 01:33.222
Right.

01:33.343 --> 01:33.584
Yeah.

01:33.705 --> 01:34.247
Talk about that.

01:34.852 --> 01:42.319
Well, Lord, I came a little old town in Oklahoma, depression, no jobs.

01:42.339 --> 01:44.421
I'm going into the service to get me a career.

01:45.582 --> 01:48.785
Learned photography and come out and, you know, make a lot of money.

01:49.006 --> 01:49.266
Ha!

01:51.688 --> 01:53.009
Didn't work out that way.

01:53.029 --> 01:53.630
No.

01:53.650 --> 02:04.200
So I joined the Air Corps, hitchhiked from Oklahoma up to Illinois and joined the Air Corps there in Illinois.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.483
And I sat there and did KP.

02:06.643 --> 02:08.445
I signed up for photography.

02:09.807 --> 02:14.753
And I waited and waited, and KP and KP finally I said, hey, what else have you got?

02:14.773 --> 02:22.842
They said radio, so I went to radio school down in Scott Field, which is south, down south in Illinois.

02:23.163 --> 02:26.106
Right, right, right.

02:26.126 --> 02:27.488
Several months of that.

02:29.476 --> 02:31.759
Put up the board, where are you going?

02:33.041 --> 02:35.525
Elmendorf Field, Anchorage, Alaska.

02:35.585 --> 02:36.867
Where in the world is that?

02:38.389 --> 02:39.130
I'll soon learn.

02:40.372 --> 02:44.619
So I got up there in October of 41, of course, before Pearl Harbor.

02:44.979 --> 02:45.260
Right.

02:46.762 --> 02:53.532
I want to stop you there because you talked about how you had grown up and sort of the difference a little bit when you went into the service.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.635
Carl is a writer.

02:56.088 --> 03:01.234
And we're going to talk about that a lot more, because his 30-year career was in journalism, as a matter of fact.

03:01.874 --> 03:04.297
And he's written a book here.

03:05.058 --> 03:10.003
This is a lot of book about, this is actually a collection of his writings.

03:10.384 --> 03:11.665
It just goes on and on and on.

03:12.466 --> 03:22.197
And I want to read just real quick from this, because this sort of refers to when you went from your normal life, when you were in high school, into the service.

03:22.217 --> 03:23.918
And he writes in poem, as a matter of fact.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.420
He says, my first meal in this

03:25.940 --> 03:27.862
a mess hall nearly blew my mind.

03:27.882 --> 03:29.464
I was raised on beans and cornbread.

03:29.524 --> 03:31.065
Like this, I had never dined.

03:31.766 --> 03:34.028
There was bread and fruit, three kinds of meat.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.050
This was a dream.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.973
Also five kinds of vegetables topped off with cake and ice cream.

03:39.774 --> 03:42.837
Man, I was in hog heaven, and I walloped three times a day.

03:43.377 --> 03:47.101
Besides the chow came free clothes, plus 21 bucks monthly pay.

03:47.782 --> 03:50.765
I couldn't believe some guys who griped about the grub.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.748
As I said, many were poor like me.

03:54.028 --> 03:55.069
Who you kidding, bub?

03:55.808 --> 03:59.093
Aside from those amenities, we drilled and pulled KP.

03:59.113 --> 04:03.679
KP stands for Kitchen Police, no arrests, just drudgery.

04:03.699 --> 04:09.347
So going into the Army, you ate a lot better and you dressed a lot better and you got some money for it.

04:09.587 --> 04:12.010
Hey, I was in all gamins, I said.

04:13.733 --> 04:14.534
I couldn't believe it.

04:14.574 --> 04:20.382
I thought, well, they gave us this show to get us in and then after that it's going to be out.

04:20.902 --> 04:22.325
Man, it was that way all the time.

04:22.405 --> 04:23.747
I was happy.

04:24.429 --> 04:26.212
But you were at Elmendorf Field.

04:26.252 --> 04:28.256
That's where you were first sent.

04:28.276 --> 04:31.161
And that's for people who don't know their geography.

04:31.181 --> 04:33.886
That's just near, I guess, just north of Anchorage, right?

04:34.006 --> 04:35.709
Very, very near Anchorage.

04:35.890 --> 04:36.631
Right outside.

04:36.771 --> 04:38.835
Outscourts, you'd say.

04:38.855 --> 04:39.276
Of Anchorage.

04:39.817 --> 04:40.679
Talk about what you did.

04:40.719 --> 04:42.262
You were a radio operator.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.125
Not talking, but tapping out.

04:44.105 --> 04:44.926
You were a tapper.

04:45.367 --> 04:50.473
Right, dots and dash, that sort of stuff.

04:50.493 --> 04:50.734
Right.

04:50.974 --> 05:07.716
So, of course, in the radio, you learn regular alphabet, U.S., dots and dash, da-da-da-da is Q. But we got up there and found out that, hey, they had a different...

05:07.983 --> 05:09.866
What the hell is this?

05:09.946 --> 05:14.833
It's all in two extra numbers, two extra letters.

05:16.075 --> 05:19.300
Turned out we were learning to communicate with the Russians.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.481
Right.

05:20.501 --> 05:26.550
So in a few months, they got me on a plane with Master Sergeant.

05:26.570 --> 05:28.573
We went to Nome, Alaska.

05:29.161 --> 05:31.845
And Nome, Alaska.

05:31.985 --> 05:33.527
You're talking about where is a place?

05:33.688 --> 05:34.429
Nome, Alaska.

05:34.829 --> 05:36.291
It's right on the Bering Sea.

05:36.892 --> 05:37.072
Right.

05:37.092 --> 05:38.875
Far western part of the state.

05:40.037 --> 05:45.304
Excuse this, but my saying, the rest of the Alaska is lush.

05:45.324 --> 05:46.406
You see it all the time.

05:47.387 --> 05:50.432
At Nome, Bering, nothing.

05:50.552 --> 05:51.213
No tree.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.336
No tree, period.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.638
Right.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.582
As I told people,

05:58.068 --> 06:03.118
If Alaska ever got sick, where they'd give the enema would be at Nome, Alaska.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.744
I've heard you say that.

06:07.526 --> 06:10.752
I'm sure the Chamber of Commerce of Nome probably doesn't put that on their sign.

06:10.972 --> 06:12.014
Chamber of Commerce.

06:12.916 --> 06:15.301
They're lucky to have a sheriff.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.208
This would be a good time to jump ahead a little bit and talk about the weather.

06:19.769 --> 06:20.751
Not only the weather,

06:21.220 --> 06:28.315
But the northern lights, during the wintertime, it's light for only about three hours a day.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.461
During the summertime, it doesn't turn dark at all.

06:32.022 --> 06:37.153
Sort of how that affected you and how a kid from Oklahoma got used to that.

06:37.302 --> 06:45.593
First of all, at Nome, three months of the year, in the summertime, the harbor was open.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.435
Otherwise, it's frozen solid.

06:47.455 --> 06:55.906
So any supplies you had for eating or food came in the boat those three months.

06:56.867 --> 07:00.812
Well, along about January, we were running out of meat.

07:01.872 --> 07:07.359
So they'd get on the half-track and go out to the wilderness and shoot a reindeer and drag it in.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.763
So that was our meat for the rest of the year.

07:12.426 --> 07:15.190
Surprisingly, when we first moved up there, we were in tents.

07:16.231 --> 07:21.058
Eventually, they got the Quonset Huts, which was the metal half-circle deal.

07:22.139 --> 07:25.344
And quite comfortable, really.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.588
And the Northern Lights...

07:31.420 --> 07:36.449
I think once in a while, I actually saw them in Oklahoma one time.

07:36.469 --> 07:49.494
But it's just a display of violets, blues, greens, like gases just moving all over it.

07:51.658 --> 07:54.002
Pretty, but, boy, for radio signals.

07:55.332 --> 07:56.593
It would... They killed it.

07:56.773 --> 07:57.894
It killed you, Ray Sid.

07:57.914 --> 08:00.016
It would bounce your signals to who knows where.

08:00.036 --> 08:01.217
Well, it's static.

08:01.237 --> 08:02.318
Right.

08:02.338 --> 08:03.039
Right, right.

08:03.059 --> 08:04.160
That's why I can hardly hear.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.462
That's why I have two hearing aids today.

08:06.682 --> 08:07.403
Right, right.

08:07.463 --> 08:11.807
Because of the noise it was created from the signals bouncing off the northern lights.

08:11.827 --> 08:13.528
And trying to hear the signal through that.

08:14.049 --> 08:22.276
You talked about the time and where the sun would not go down or the sun would not come up depending on the time of year.

08:22.316 --> 08:24.698
And especially during the summertime,

08:24.678 --> 08:30.364
you had to sleep according to the clock not according to whether it got dark because it didn't get dark and sometimes that was difficult.

08:30.885 --> 08:46.703
Well space had moved on from there moved to Fairbanks right and it's 40 50 mile below the arctic circle and which meant it didn't completely get dark but

08:47.746 --> 08:55.116
In the so-called summertime, the sun had come up about three hours, dark.

08:56.237 --> 09:04.508
And, of course, they, I mean, in the wintertime, it was that way, and in the summer, it was just the opposite.

09:04.528 --> 09:14.461
Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce, and they did have that, Chamber of Commerce, had a baseball game, and they threw out the first pitch at midnight.

09:16.224 --> 09:17.145
Thing is...

09:18.239 --> 09:20.023
No spotlights or floodlights.

09:20.063 --> 09:21.406
There's sunshine.

09:22.789 --> 09:24.192
That was one of their big deals.

09:24.613 --> 09:24.914
Right.

09:25.134 --> 09:26.297
Baseball at midnight.

09:26.477 --> 09:27.740
Right, right.

09:27.780 --> 09:31.609
Sometimes you had to try to sleep while other people were playing cards or messing around, right?

09:31.709 --> 09:35.597
Well, we were eight on and 16 off, so.

09:35.858 --> 09:37.682
Right, right.

09:38.202 --> 09:54.333
Why don't you talk about your job and what you did when you were in Nome, Alaska, and about the ferrying of airplanes and sort of the Russian pilots and sort of how you become a little bit versed with the American-Russian relations in World War II.

09:54.373 --> 09:55.796
You got to know a couple of them anyway.

09:56.177 --> 09:56.477
Right.

09:56.658 --> 09:56.818
Yep.

09:57.625 --> 10:04.013
Of course, what they did was they set up the Lend-Lease program.

10:04.373 --> 10:06.435
We gave them planes and they gave us hell.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.321
The U.S.

10:11.742 --> 10:17.669
pilots would fly the planes to Fairbanks and then the Russians would take over.

10:17.689 --> 10:19.010
And they had a pretty deep system.

10:19.030 --> 10:24.797
They had the B-25, which is a radio contact with the Earth.

10:25.233 --> 10:35.406
And then behind it, they'd string back these pursuit planes, and they had contact with the mothership, which talked down below.

10:35.486 --> 10:38.850
Well, those planes that they loved were the P-39s.

10:39.451 --> 10:47.221
They had a cannon in the nose, and they loved to shoot those krauts, kraut tanks with those things.

10:48.282 --> 10:51.426
So our job was really, basically,

10:51.406 --> 11:00.760
contact the Siberia station, get the weather report, tell them the planes are coming, and back and forth that way.

11:01.161 --> 11:07.470
Of course, the pilot had no, excuse me, the weather over there, and we'd get the weather report from Siberia.

11:08.692 --> 11:10.955
And that's about it.

11:11.336 --> 11:15.422
Give them a flight plan, how many planes are coming, and boy, we sent a lot of them over there.

11:15.622 --> 11:16.505
Indeed.

11:16.525 --> 11:17.407
They liked the P-39s.

11:17.588 --> 11:20.115
Oh, they loved the P-39s.

11:20.135 --> 11:20.556
Right.

11:20.917 --> 11:24.107
And they would use them to fight the Germans on the Western Front.

11:24.187 --> 11:28.559
Well, yes, strafing for the tanks, those cannons, they loved that.

11:28.579 --> 11:30.846
So we had a couple of Russian

11:32.075 --> 11:40.464
This old Sergeant Musienko, if you were visualizing a Russian peasant, you'd think of this guy.

11:40.665 --> 11:44.769
Big and burly and kind of pretty nice looking, really.

11:44.789 --> 11:49.274
And they had this cocky little Giorno with the lieutenant.

11:49.294 --> 11:51.997
He had a little gun he wore that he'd taken off.

11:52.037 --> 11:53.258
He was on the western front.

11:53.299 --> 11:56.462
He'd taken off a German...

11:56.442 --> 12:00.489
I guess a dead person.

12:00.509 --> 12:07.342
And so they couldn't speak English, we couldn't speak German, I mean Russian.

12:08.224 --> 12:14.535
So we communicated each other with our radio signal by writing.

12:15.865 --> 12:24.863
Even there, you didn't use letters because Q's and R's, they had their own alphabet.

12:24.883 --> 12:25.364
Right.

12:25.384 --> 12:29.131
So we just spelled dot, dash, dot.

12:29.151 --> 12:32.217
But QRM was, I have a message for it.

12:32.698 --> 12:35.764
So we'd put QRT, which is time.

12:36.503 --> 12:37.484
They had a question mark.

12:37.505 --> 12:41.470
That would ask them, when are you going to come back to the station?

12:43.373 --> 12:50.544
Of course, communicating with the Russian station on the other side, that's all we use is that kind of language.

12:51.405 --> 12:53.128
And we found out those ladies over there

12:53.480 --> 12:56.263
people over there, the operators were women.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.166
So we'd flirt with them.

12:58.186 --> 13:07.217
77 in Russian, not Russian, in Hamlang, which is 7788 with love and kisses.

13:07.237 --> 13:09.019
So we're going to send them kisses.

13:09.419 --> 13:10.841
That leads me to some more poetry.

13:10.861 --> 13:14.205
As a matter of fact, I'll read this now because you talk about this in your writing.

13:14.666 --> 13:22.575
It says, a radio station was to be built to send signals across the Bering Sea, then would follow a sky full of Lindley's planes, really

13:22.792 --> 13:24.154
Lend-lease meant free.

13:24.995 --> 13:29.260
When the station went on the air, I fingered the sending key.

13:30.021 --> 13:33.366
I sent the Siberian station call letters across the Bering Sea.

13:33.686 --> 13:37.411
I kept tapping those call letters till I achieved victory.

13:37.431 --> 13:40.735
Radio communication were now in place across the ICC.

13:41.016 --> 13:46.723
And then he went on to say, like you just referred to, all the Russian operators were female.

13:46.973 --> 13:48.735
maybe grandmas or missus.

13:48.755 --> 13:53.099
I tapped out 73s and 88s, telegraphese for love and kisses.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.903
So you were flirting with that radio tap key, right?

13:58.184 --> 14:00.727
This Musienko was a character.

14:00.747 --> 14:02.589
He tried to tell us jokes in Russian.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.130
Of course, we didn't understand.

14:04.971 --> 14:10.657
One time he went in to know him and he came back and he's all excited.

14:10.677 --> 14:13.079
He said, he tried.

14:13.099 --> 14:14.981
Of course, he couldn't tell us what he said.

14:15.001 --> 14:15.602
He showed us.

14:15.622 --> 14:16.002
He said,

14:17.365 --> 14:24.435
And then he started turning, just humming right away.

14:24.536 --> 14:26.939
Hey, he'd seen his first jukebox.

14:27.119 --> 14:27.400
Right.

14:27.540 --> 14:28.421
Yeah.

14:29.162 --> 14:31.145
He thought that was the greatest.

14:31.165 --> 14:32.067
It was a peasant.

14:32.087 --> 14:33.809
Really, he was a peasant is what he was.

14:33.989 --> 14:34.250
Right.

14:34.951 --> 14:36.894
He was real excited about the jukebox.

14:36.914 --> 14:39.598
He'd seen a lot at Nome, his first one ever.

14:39.618 --> 14:40.419
Right, right.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.725
You were in Nome for, I guess, almost two years, right?

14:45.146 --> 14:45.246
Yeah.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.793
or in Alaska for almost three years.

14:48.854 --> 14:52.458
And you kind of thought they'd thrown away your records and forgotten about you, right?

14:53.439 --> 14:54.721
As a matter of fact, yes.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.063
No furloughs, no.

14:57.083 --> 15:05.913
Middle of 1943, you were transferred to Fairbanks, and then you came home in April of 1944 and served in Arizona and California at the time.

15:06.674 --> 15:12.921
Did a lot of flight plans, numbers, call letters, just kept on being a radio guy.

15:13.424 --> 15:20.235
But then when you came back to the United States, they kind of gave you the option of, like, where do you want to go?

15:20.255 --> 15:22.559
You told them where you wanted to go, but you didn't get to go there, right?

15:22.579 --> 15:29.591
Well, first of all, when I left Fairbanks, the snow was up here.

15:30.693 --> 15:32.957
They sent me to Phoenix, Arizona.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.040
That's a difference.

15:35.060 --> 15:39.027
My Lord, for the first month, I worked around...

15:39.007 --> 15:40.349
My blood thinned out.

15:40.389 --> 15:43.874
I said, okay.

15:43.914 --> 15:46.798
They said, hey, you've been over once.

15:46.838 --> 15:47.720
You get your choice.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.641
I said, okay.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.906
Paris, B-9, Big Ben, all that stuff.

15:51.926 --> 15:52.727
I'll take Europe.

15:54.109 --> 15:58.495
Okay, about a couple of months, you're assigned to the Philippines.

15:59.617 --> 16:00.378
Right, right.

16:00.398 --> 16:03.242
I wanted to backtrack because one thing that we missed was the fact that

16:03.222 --> 16:07.566
when you were in Alaska is, you were in Alaska on December 7, 1941.

16:07.827 --> 16:08.587
Yes.

16:09.088 --> 16:11.691
And what do you recall about that Sunday?

16:12.491 --> 16:21.821
Well, there it was lunchtime, and I'd just come out of the mess hall, and this guy kept running across the way and said, hey, Pearl Harbor's been attacked.

16:22.642 --> 16:24.664
Yeah, where's Pearl Harbor?

16:25.064 --> 16:28.427
You know, like most people, probably didn't know where it was.

16:29.228 --> 16:32.031
So...

16:33.125 --> 16:45.143
I don't know why, but before the day was over, they had me out on this little dirt road with a Thompson submachine gun, which I fired once in recruit camp.

16:46.845 --> 16:53.755
I was defending Elmsor Field.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.020
Man, talk about silliness.

16:57.421 --> 16:58.482
I don't know.

16:58.502 --> 16:59.824
It shows really how...

17:00.175 --> 17:02.018
How unprepared the U.S.

17:02.038 --> 17:02.499
was.

17:02.519 --> 17:03.380
Right, right.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.942
In all, lots of regards.

17:04.962 --> 17:05.423
That's right.

17:05.443 --> 17:08.167
So that was the difference between you were not in war and you were in war.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.090
They gave you a gun and said, go defend something.

17:10.491 --> 17:12.053
Yeah.

17:13.976 --> 17:16.840
But then you, but things ratcheted up then.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.925
I mean, when America was in the war, things changed.

17:19.945 --> 17:21.467
You saw things that you hadn't seen before.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.950
Right, right, right.

17:22.970 --> 17:23.871
More airplanes coming.

17:25.943 --> 17:33.532
A few months after that, I'm up in Nome, and man, we got planes going to Russia about every other day practically.

17:33.852 --> 17:34.633
Right, right.

17:34.973 --> 17:42.983
When you came back to the States, you'd ask for Europe, so like the service normally does, they sent you to the Philippines.

17:43.183 --> 17:43.523
Right.

17:44.284 --> 17:45.906
About as far away from Europe as you could get.

17:46.467 --> 17:53.014
And it was a long boat ride because they avoided the

17:53.348 --> 18:00.735
a lot of activity, so we made a big circle and went around New Guinea and then came up to the Philippines.

18:00.755 --> 18:02.977
I think it was about three weeks on that darn boat.

18:03.397 --> 18:09.363
Of course, we were stacked about five high in the bunks on the ship.

18:10.544 --> 18:20.453
It was, before the war, SS and Loreline, one of the cruise lines you paid a lot of money to ride on.

18:20.568 --> 18:22.450
For us, it wasn't that big a deal.

18:22.470 --> 18:23.171
Right.

18:23.191 --> 18:26.194
By the time you got to the Philippines, though, most of the operations there were over.

18:26.254 --> 18:27.435
The war was wrapping up.

18:28.096 --> 18:29.517
The bomb had not been dropped yet, though.

18:29.558 --> 18:32.220
You were in the Philippines when the bomb was dropped in 1945.

18:32.601 --> 18:33.582
Yeah.

18:33.942 --> 18:34.543
Right.

18:34.563 --> 18:44.213
And all the rumors, hey, we're going to be inundated by tidal waves and the world's coming to the end and all that.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.523
Of course, none of that had happened.

18:46.623 --> 18:48.388
What has got us home?

18:48.749 --> 18:49.150
Right.

18:50.213 --> 18:56.329
But there was also obviously the rumors that everybody was dealing with that there was going to be a ground war.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.548
in Japan.

18:58.748 --> 19:04.138
And of course the bomb dropped and that changed all that and the war ended.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.886
And then you were able to come home.

19:09.427 --> 19:12.893
And a fascinating career after your service.

19:14.175 --> 19:19.043
You came home and I believe you...

19:19.765 --> 19:22.292
were discharged in October of 1945.

19:22.392 --> 19:23.917
Is that right?

19:24.237 --> 19:26.484
And you went to Colorado, because that's where your sister lived.

19:26.664 --> 19:27.707
That's where you started out.

19:28.469 --> 19:32.340
And you started off in college there, but then talk about after that.

19:33.535 --> 19:40.105
First of all, after five years away from school, right out of high school, I didn't know if I'd cut college or not.

19:40.126 --> 19:44.713
So I just said, come live with us and see if you like it.

19:44.733 --> 19:45.374
You can cut it.

19:46.616 --> 19:47.097
I could.

19:47.958 --> 19:54.589
I wanted journalism, which is the best journalism school, or at least the most popular anyway.

19:54.729 --> 19:56.411
No, it was Missouri University.

19:56.431 --> 19:59.777
So I signed up.

19:59.797 --> 20:00.538
Went to Columbia.

20:01.092 --> 20:04.960
went to Columbia and if you're out of state,

20:06.256 --> 20:12.025
You weren't entitled to housing there because you had such a shortage.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.910
They asked for the local natives to get first.

20:15.771 --> 20:19.497
Well, the only way I could get in was to join a fraternity.

20:19.517 --> 20:26.308
And boy, you talk about going around and sweet-talking those days to get pledged.

20:26.328 --> 20:26.628
I made it.

20:26.748 --> 20:27.570
To get a place to live.

20:27.870 --> 20:28.231
Right.

20:28.351 --> 20:28.611
Right.

20:28.832 --> 20:30.775
Right.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.297
So you were a frat boy.

20:32.429 --> 20:36.555
You don't look the part right now, but you were a frat boy.

20:37.897 --> 20:38.838
From necessity.

20:39.699 --> 20:40.681
Of course, I enjoyed it.

20:40.701 --> 20:42.243
Because you needed to bed, right?

20:42.764 --> 20:48.752
But you majored in journalism in Missouri, which is still known as one of the foremost journalism schools in the United States.

20:48.772 --> 20:49.994
There's no doubt about that.

20:50.755 --> 20:58.386
And that sent you to corporate journalism, as it were, because you went to work for Standard Oil Company.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.664
And talk about what you did.

21:00.684 --> 21:05.893
You traveled around place to place, sort of writing for their newsletter or their house organ, right?

21:06.073 --> 21:06.394
Right.

21:06.414 --> 21:14.789
First of all, that was the idea was I supplied for several places for jobs to be a magazine.

21:14.809 --> 21:16.151
I didn't want to get newspapers.

21:16.813 --> 21:19.898
What I wanted to write wanted to last more than one day.

21:20.259 --> 21:20.499
Right.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.062
So I...

21:22.632 --> 21:32.550
connect with them, and they had a nice publication, magazine, monthly, and this enabled me to travel over the Midwest, 11 states.

21:32.570 --> 21:35.515
Tulsa, Chicago, Texas City, Kansas City.

21:35.916 --> 21:37.078
Yeah, right.

21:37.098 --> 21:40.805
All from Wyoming to Indiana, south to Texas.

21:41.165 --> 21:41.406
Right.

21:41.486 --> 21:43.189
That whole area.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.611
And talk about what you'd write about.

21:44.651 --> 21:54.804
You would write feature stories about not only employees of Standard Oil Company, but employees of sort of a subsidiary or a supplier or people that you supplied, right?

21:54.824 --> 22:02.194
If it had a connection with the company, like for instance, I did a story about automaking.

22:02.314 --> 22:07.000
Well, that's because our company supplied

22:07.587 --> 22:14.656
any number of greases and lubricants for all their, for their machines that made the automobile.

22:14.897 --> 22:15.798
Right.

22:15.818 --> 22:21.085
Or it might be a story about grape nuts.

22:21.646 --> 22:24.710
Yeah, you went to Battle Creek to write about the people who make grape nuts, right?

22:24.730 --> 22:34.042
They were up in Missouri and, well, Colorado, did molybdenum.

22:34.382 --> 22:34.843
Right.

22:35.144 --> 22:40.871
Mining, we supplied the materials for what they did for the mining.

22:42.052 --> 22:44.595
I could just pick and choose, and man, it was fun.

22:45.736 --> 22:47.899
Of course, I had to always tie in the employees.

22:48.299 --> 22:55.067
They were either working for that outfit or they were supplying the materials in some ways.

22:55.087 --> 22:57.409
There's one thing I wanted to backtrack to that I didn't want to miss.

22:57.490 --> 23:04.898
Back in your service in Alaska, you had spent a lot of time writing sort of an autobiography, sort of a memoir.

23:05.705 --> 23:08.810
in Alaska, and tell them about what happened to that.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.814
You don't know what happened to it, but tell them.

23:11.834 --> 23:11.894
No.

23:11.914 --> 23:20.868
Well, as a gnome, we either were working or were sitting in the Quonset hut because there was no recreation.

23:21.790 --> 23:28.360
On some Army base, you had the gyms and all that stuff, but gnome just didn't have all that.

23:28.900 --> 23:29.141
Right.

23:29.181 --> 23:31.324
So I had a typewriter, and I was

23:32.249 --> 23:38.758
So I had to write a memoir about growing up with grandpa and grandma on the farm.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.542
I wrote it and sent it in.

23:41.902 --> 23:45.207
It was probably some warehouse, some place.

23:45.247 --> 23:45.948
I don't know.

23:45.968 --> 23:46.669
I had any idea.

23:47.550 --> 23:50.895
It never was published, but it gave me good experience writing.

23:51.235 --> 23:53.278
Yeah, like I said, you sent it through...

23:54.018 --> 23:57.163
You sent it through the censors.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.566
The censorship, yeah.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.247
Yeah.

24:00.307 --> 24:06.256
As a matter of fact, there was something in this book that I was going to read if I could find it.

24:06.316 --> 24:08.159
I talked about how you wrote poetry.

24:08.179 --> 24:09.281
Let me read this one real quick.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.342
I love your writing.

24:10.763 --> 24:11.304
Thank you.

24:11.424 --> 24:12.826
It's tremendous.

24:12.866 --> 24:14.068
You evidently enjoyed golf.

24:14.842 --> 24:21.950
This has nothing to do with his service or anything else, and the poetry says, a bogey is one over par, an eagle is minus two.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.453
A birdie is one under par, something I seldom do.

24:25.473 --> 24:33.181
Come that time and around when you make those perfect swings, this wipes out all the anguish and gives your ego wings.

24:33.201 --> 24:36.825
In golf, a birdie has no feathers and a bogey has no bacall.

24:37.426 --> 24:40.149
When I score a triple bogey, I like to hide and ball.

24:40.629 --> 24:44.173
Barry Bonds can smash a ball, traveling an ungodly speed.

24:44.474 --> 24:53.383
I can't miss that little sucker sitting quietly on its tee.

24:53.503 --> 24:54.624
That's tremendous, and you're right.

24:54.664 --> 25:00.950
Talk about 30 years with a standard oil company.

25:01.271 --> 25:03.953
Just some great experiences there and some great chances to write.

25:04.093 --> 25:13.823
The beauty of being with a corporation like that, I worked for the corporation, but with several branches of it.

25:14.663 --> 25:20.391
It would be a smaller company or it would be the marketing department or it would be the sales department or whatever.

25:21.413 --> 25:27.863
And I had moved from, well, Tulsa, Chicago, Texas City, Kansas City, Chicago, Houston.

25:27.883 --> 25:28.223
Right.

25:29.004 --> 25:32.950
Now, every five years I'd move, which was nice.

25:33.411 --> 25:34.933
I didn't want to sit behind a desk.

25:36.466 --> 25:37.708
You were talking about the censorship.

25:38.949 --> 25:39.990
I wish I could read this whole book.

25:40.010 --> 25:40.771
I wish we had time.

25:41.833 --> 25:48.421
This is an article you wrote called, Censors, Scissors, Snip, Substance from Correspondence.

25:48.441 --> 25:50.884
It said, Mom kept all the letters I wrote from Alaska.

25:51.144 --> 25:55.750
Long after the war, I dug into them expecting to revive some forgotten experiences.

25:56.411 --> 25:57.693
What a pile of pablum.

25:58.514 --> 26:01.157
There was nada, zilch, nothing in them.

26:01.373 --> 26:24.833
remember the war was on and censorship was in effect you didn't write about the weather where you were the surroundings conditions your assignment blah blah blah we were instructed to write on only one side of a sheet thus the censor could scissor out forbidden information without gutting the letter and then you say one time i must have written something really interesting the envelope contained two strips of paper

26:25.184 --> 26:27.828
Dear mom on one and my signature on the other.

26:27.848 --> 26:30.371
And that was the only thing that was left of the letter.

26:32.154 --> 26:35.258
So you had to be careful about censorships, right?

26:38.723 --> 26:40.405
We have just a few minutes left.

26:40.845 --> 26:44.731
You and Janet have been married for almost 60 years now.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.013
Next February, I'd be 60.

26:46.233 --> 26:46.834
1950.

26:46.854 --> 26:48.055
Talk a little bit about your family.

26:48.636 --> 26:51.280
Well, I've got four great kids.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.221
Yeah.

26:52.606 --> 27:05.278
Of course, I was the first one in my generation to go to college and get a degree, and I'm proud to say all four of them got their degrees, and they're doing quite well.

27:05.778 --> 27:11.463
One of them's the local nurse here in College Station, Adele.

27:12.705 --> 27:16.868
Another daughter is Diane up in New York.

27:17.809 --> 27:20.672
My youngest works for the

27:22.711 --> 27:27.957
Well, he secured it around the Washington, D.C.

27:27.977 --> 27:29.118
with the Park Service.

27:29.398 --> 27:29.638
Right.

27:29.959 --> 27:33.703
And the other one lives in, works in Austin.

27:34.143 --> 27:34.684
Right.

27:34.824 --> 27:37.487
David works in Austin.

27:37.567 --> 27:40.090
Brian's in New York or Washington.

27:40.850 --> 27:42.392
Diane's in New York.

27:42.592 --> 27:43.313
Right.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.436
And I know your daughter and your granddaughter help you and Janet out a lot here.

27:46.476 --> 27:47.658
You live over at Waldenbrook.

27:47.858 --> 27:48.178
Right.

27:48.238 --> 27:48.759
They help you.

27:48.839 --> 27:49.099
Right.

27:49.119 --> 27:49.900
They help you a lot.

27:50.673 --> 27:58.904
We moved over here about 16 months ago, chose Waldenbrook because of the amenities they have.

27:59.104 --> 27:59.885
Right, right.

28:00.265 --> 28:12.221
Well, I'll tell you what, it's a remarkable story, and it just goes to show that it's not just the stories of combat that make World War II veterans very interesting people because you had an interesting career.

28:12.241 --> 28:14.283
And I want to thank you for your service, but we're out of time.

28:15.204 --> 28:15.865
It goes fast.

28:15.885 --> 28:16.506
Thank you.

28:16.526 --> 28:17.187
Thank you, Carl.

28:18.398 --> 28:24.707
He started out thinking that he would be a photographer, but spent 30 years making a career of painting pictures through his written word.

28:25.228 --> 28:27.451
And he still enjoys writing whenever he can.

28:27.471 --> 28:30.656
Carl and Janet Huss were married in February of 1950.

28:31.517 --> 28:34.582
We salute him for his service to our country, as we do all veterans.

28:35.223 --> 28:36.505
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:36.525 --> 28:38.888
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:46.090 --> 28:50.886
Thank you.
