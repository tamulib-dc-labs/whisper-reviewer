00:19.673 --> 00:38.527
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.547 --> 00:39.589
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:40.126 --> 00:52.940
Dr. Rex Davis tells an incredible story of service that includes action in both World War II, where he was aboard an LCS during the invasion of Okinawa, and later his service as a medical doctor in Vietnam.

00:53.461 --> 00:56.008
He served in the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army.

00:56.242 --> 01:04.577
Between World War II and Vietnam, he returned home to Giddings, finished high school, college, and med school before starting his career as a doctor.

01:05.098 --> 01:11.329
An accomplished writer, Dr. Davis has penned many of his accounts of service in the form of fascinating short stories.

01:11.770 --> 01:16.859
We will read some of those as we visit with Dr. Rex Davis today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.325
Dr. Davis, it's an honor to know you and to have you here.

01:20.305 --> 01:29.295
I want to go right into your action in World War II because I think it's a fascinating story, especially a day that you call your day of infamy, May 28th, 1945.

01:29.575 --> 01:34.100
You were serving aboard LCS, Landing Craft Support.

01:34.120 --> 01:40.688
Sort of talk about what happened that day and what led up to the kamikaze attack that you witnessed.

01:40.708 --> 01:41.469
Go ahead, talk about it.

01:42.650 --> 01:49.097
Well, we were reporting into the destroyer Drexler and...

01:49.280 --> 02:15.844
We had been there previously and there had been some bad weather but today appeared to be a very pretty day so we figured that there might be a lot going on and as we approached the radar picket station which was about 50 miles north of Okinawa, I became aware of the fact that a

02:16.583 --> 02:24.971
kamikaze suicide plane was headed for one of the ships.

02:24.991 --> 02:36.122
It seemed to miss this ship but stumbled on and actually suicided into the Drexler, the destroyer that we were to report into.

02:37.964 --> 02:43.229
The Drexler radioed us that they were sort of dead in the water.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.152
They weren't going to sink immediately but they were

02:46.587 --> 02:52.654
put out of action and asked us to get on up there.

02:52.875 --> 03:00.123
And we went to a more moderate speed called full, head full.

03:01.024 --> 03:12.598
And our ship was an amphibious craft and actually pushed more water it seemed than we were able to make headway on.

03:12.618 --> 03:14.721
And it took us a little while to start

03:14.920 --> 03:44.387
getting in their direction and while we were watching the situation, another suicide plane was headed for the Drexler and it seemed to miss and this suicide plane was being chased by two Corsairs in the air and they had it in his cross, they were

03:44.705 --> 03:53.476
in his crossfire, but he skimmed over the Drexler and looked like it would splash into the water.

03:54.357 --> 03:55.779
But it didn't.

03:55.919 --> 04:03.108
It made a left banking turn and went up into the air and then came down directly onto the Drexler.

04:04.349 --> 04:06.612
And I was topside.

04:07.193 --> 04:08.695
It was my battle.

04:08.715 --> 04:14.442
It was my duty during that...

04:14.759 --> 04:31.063
battle stations to take care of the action and so I recorded the time and when the smoke cleared the valve was up on the Drexler and it was sinking very fast and it went down in 49 seconds.

04:32.345 --> 04:42.100
Now the circumstances are that the destroyers carried crude

04:42.569 --> 04:43.610
fuel.

04:44.772 --> 04:53.944
And when it sank, this crude oil floated around and left a wide donut of oil.

04:55.566 --> 05:11.007
The men that were immediately off the Drexler had to swim through this goo, this oil, but they were the lucky ones because as this

05:11.341 --> 05:37.450
oil spread out, the burning suicide flame ignited the fuel and in a short while there was a donut of flames probably a mile wide in diameter and there were men inside these flames yelling for help and we couldn't get through.

05:38.071 --> 05:47.164
We would go up to the flames and have to back off because we were loaded down with fuel and ammunition.

05:49.587 --> 06:00.602
But there were some of the men that had escaped from the Drexler that were in the water nearby, and so we started rescuing these men as we could.

06:01.764 --> 06:04.247
And one of our...

06:06.573 --> 06:30.345
Shumar, the boatswain, he pushed a guy, a couple of the fellows that were near him into the water and he went into the water himself and said, come on, we've got to help those guys, rescue those guys because many of them were in the water without any flotation of any kind.

06:30.905 --> 06:32.968
They were in the water so rapidly

06:33.370 --> 06:37.955
that they didn't have on any life vests or anything of that sort.

06:37.975 --> 06:45.983
So we attempted to get through the flames several different times but were never able to make it.

06:47.264 --> 06:55.472
And these men that had gone into the water were rescuing men as we made attempts.

06:57.034 --> 07:00.998
But finally we were going to make a real

07:01.383 --> 07:27.576
broad attempt and we saw that Shumar was off to the side after he had rescued several men he was holding up a man and the captain through the loudspeaker the bullhorn said called to him and said we're going to attempt to get through the flames again can you hold up the man that you're with and he waved us on

07:28.096 --> 07:31.279
and so we went on towards the flames.

07:31.299 --> 07:57.124
Now the circumstances were that Shumar and I were not real fond of each other and when I saw that he was going to be out there alone there was sort of a transformation that came over me and I became very wary of the fact that I didn't know whether he could hold on or not because I

07:57.543 --> 08:08.478
harkened back to one of the times that I was in the water and had attempted to swim to a plane that was probably less than a mile away.

08:09.099 --> 08:22.538
And I found out that I couldn't swim very far because we weren't in good condition being aboard the ship and not moving and having calisthenics and things of that sort.

08:23.058 --> 08:39.801
So I was very upset and worried about Shumar being in the water and sort of started babbling to myself about the fact that, hang on, Shumar, you old goat, the man that I've hated so long.

08:40.882 --> 08:44.928
And here was the people that were on the conning tower with me.

08:44.968 --> 08:52.558
The conning tower is the top over the bridge.

08:53.062 --> 09:19.204
It's where the captain holds command of the ship, and we were up here, and we were watching Shumar out in the water, so it was sort of, at the same time that it was tragic, it was sort of,

09:19.657 --> 09:28.550
funny that here I was with my enemy and I was babbling to myself, hang on, Shumar, I hope you can make it.

09:28.810 --> 09:40.187
And we weren't able to make it, but we did get back to Shumar and finally picked him up and I felt like he was the bravest man that I had ever known.

09:40.788 --> 09:49.360
He had probably rescued eight to ten men that day and this one man, when he brought him aboard, it made the

09:49.728 --> 10:14.065
119th man that we had rescued from the drugster a fascinating story that you told so well and and i was fortunate enough to know most of that story before you told it because we mentioned that you were a short story writer and you wrote a story that i have here it's called the bravest man i ever knew and it tells the story that you just told specifically about schumar

10:14.281 --> 10:19.527
And to sort of paraphrase a little bit what you said, if you don't mind, I'll read from that.

10:19.547 --> 10:21.470
He said, I was babbling and muttering to myself.

10:22.090 --> 10:30.320
I found myself praying silently, O Lord, please don't let anything happen to this man who I have hated for so long.

10:30.340 --> 10:42.415
And it turns out that you and he obviously became friends because as rough and tough of a guy this guy was, and you even described him as he could be a real jerk,

10:42.884 --> 10:46.590
He ended up being the bravest man you ever knew, and you wrote about him.

10:46.610 --> 10:46.931
Yes, sir.

10:47.411 --> 10:54.563
From the aspect, and your stories are just so incredible, what you put on paper.

10:55.645 --> 11:02.216
I want to, you wrote a short story about the kamikaze pilot.

11:02.236 --> 11:02.396
Yes.

11:02.756 --> 11:04.960
Hajime Fujii.

11:06.070 --> 11:19.309
I want you to talk about that because through your own research, you found out some personal things about him and his family and how he became a kamikaze pilot from being a husband and a father.

11:20.571 --> 11:25.478
Talk briefly about that and the short story that you wrote called Divine Wind.

11:27.040 --> 11:34.170
Well, what happened was that there were some men from the Drexler that had gone to Japan and

11:34.741 --> 11:45.033
they had viewed a statue of Hajime Fuji in the museum that was in Japan, in Tokyo.

11:45.053 --> 11:53.963
And the story goes that Hajime Fuji was a trainer.

11:54.284 --> 12:04.275
He had trained the pilots that were gonna be kamikaze suicide pilots when they were sent towards Okinawa.

12:04.913 --> 12:08.557
And he wanted to be one of them himself.

12:08.577 --> 12:16.645
But because he was a family man and had a family, it was impossible for him to do so.

12:17.025 --> 12:22.491
But his wife was very much a patriot like he himself.

12:23.592 --> 12:34.363
And without Hajime Fuji realizing that his wife was going to do it, she drowned herself in the two children

12:34.782 --> 12:46.136
in a river near Tokyo so that he could be free to go ahead and be a suicide pilot himself.

12:46.256 --> 12:57.049
This is a remarkable story that this man was this patriotic, but yet it is a true story so far as we know.

12:57.110 --> 13:02.376
As a matter of fact, my brother has gotten recent verification that

13:02.845 --> 13:04.727
verifies this more.

13:05.207 --> 13:12.314
He's gone online and in the web that he was using, he was able to verify my story.

13:12.975 --> 13:25.507
And what happened was that after his wife had drowned herself and her two children, why then he petitioned the government to let him be a suicide pilot himself.

13:25.527 --> 13:30.051
And so he formed up what was known as the 45th Squadron

13:30.503 --> 13:40.593
that was to assemble on 27th of May before the next day the 28th when they would get up.

13:40.613 --> 13:50.003
And this is the day of infamy that I have told about that we came upon with the Drexler being suicided on.

13:50.023 --> 13:56.690
And this pilot was the one that was the second suicide plane to suicide into the plane.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.591
You can tell

13:57.993 --> 14:04.942
that he was an accomplished pilot because like I have already told, I believe, that he was being chased by the Corsairs.

14:05.482 --> 14:17.918
It looked like he was going to overfly the Drexler and go into the water, but he veered to the left and came up and went down and landed between the stacks on the Drexler.

14:18.158 --> 14:27.730
I want to read a little bit from Divine Wind and how you describe in your writing a little bit of what you've already said, talking about Hajime Fuji.

14:28.503 --> 14:39.052
Ending it all this way would glorify himself forever as a hero, a divine sacrifice for his family, country, his military forbearance, and a divine glorification for the emperor.

14:39.072 --> 14:40.853
He believed in kamikaze.

14:40.873 --> 14:42.495
He did not look at it as suicide.

14:42.535 --> 14:48.680
He believed that any plane used in kamikaze was a blow struck for the glory of his country, something he could die for.

14:49.741 --> 14:58.408
And then, as you said, on December the 15th, 1944, that's when his wife drowned herself and her children with the belief

14:59.232 --> 15:05.819
that their souls would be waiting to join Fuji, their beginning of heaven.

15:05.999 --> 15:09.663
No longer the head of the family, Fuji can now join the Kamikaze Corps.

15:09.683 --> 15:10.644
Yes, sir.

15:11.165 --> 15:16.390
That goes along with what we've always heard about the Japanese thought during the war of fight to the death.

15:17.151 --> 15:23.738
And certainly fascinating stories in the way you've written them, not only about the bravest man you ever knew, but

15:23.819 --> 15:26.924
actually researching and finding more about Hajime Fuji.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.109
Just fascinating.

15:30.810 --> 15:37.540
Let's rewind and go back and talk a little bit about your early time in the service.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.343
You started off in the Navy.

15:39.363 --> 15:39.703
Yes, sir.

15:39.723 --> 15:40.805
17 years old.

15:40.945 --> 15:41.246
Yes, sir.

15:41.266 --> 15:42.728
You needed your father's signature.

15:43.128 --> 15:47.195
And talk about how that led to you losing the only $20 you had in your pocket.

15:48.256 --> 15:49.438
Well, I...

15:49.891 --> 15:55.860
I was at Glenmore, Louisiana which was about 28 miles to Alexandria.

15:55.880 --> 16:05.415
And Alexandria was the place that we were to go and be sworn in and then go on down to New Orleans for our physical examination.

16:06.277 --> 16:17.434
And my father had signed my papers since I was only 17 as Dwight and Davis and when we got to

16:17.819 --> 16:45.987
Alexandria and I turned in the papers why they said he has when you're 17 he can't use our initial it has to be Newton right and there were four or five other fellows that were from Glenmore that we wanted to be together during boot camp so I took a taxi and drove went the 28 miles to

16:46.388 --> 16:56.447
get to my father to have him rewrite in and sign it as Newton so that I could go with the gang.

16:57.168 --> 17:02.058
And it took the $20 that I had with me to make that trip.

17:02.158 --> 17:07.468
So I had to go to boot camp from New Orleans without any money.

17:07.702 --> 17:09.084
Went to boot camp in San Diego.

17:09.724 --> 17:10.845
Yes.

17:10.886 --> 17:18.794
You went into service school, sent you to Navy quartermaster school where in the Navy quartermaster that meant navigation and signaling.

17:19.235 --> 17:25.682
And you learned a lot of great things there and that led you to a great career first off in the Navy.

17:25.702 --> 17:34.992
I want you to talk about, this is fascinating to me also, your service stateside where you were on LCTs

17:36.001 --> 17:39.886
in New York on the Niagara River, across the Erie Canal?

17:40.566 --> 17:51.440
At North Tonawanda, New York, there was a shipbuilding plant, and they made LCTs, landing craft tanks.

17:52.521 --> 18:05.957
And when they got one ready and painted, we would bring it down the Niagara River and into the Erie Canal and across the Finger Lakes and down the Hudson to New York City.

18:06.157 --> 18:15.367
And we would usually be at New York City for two or three days and then take the train back to North Tonawanda, New York and do this over again.

18:15.427 --> 18:19.472
And I did that for about six months and then they sent us to St.

18:19.492 --> 18:25.659
Louis and we would bring ships down the tributaries to the Mississippi.

18:25.679 --> 18:33.548
Like once we made a trip from Kansas City down to Missouri, down in the Mississippi, down to New Orleans, we would

18:33.950 --> 18:41.681
bring ships all the way from Pittsburgh as a matter of fact down the Ohio and down the Mississippi and down to New Orleans.

18:42.682 --> 18:52.136
And it was a fascinating trip and I had been in Louisiana before I went in the Navy at Glenmore, Louisiana.

18:52.977 --> 19:02.370
And so sometimes I could see friends of mine that were from high school days when I got to New Orleans.

19:02.823 --> 19:15.841
It was also fascinating in the way that these were the same routes that Mark Twain would make when he was on the Mississippi.

19:16.622 --> 19:28.999
And it sort of made me fashion myself as being like Mark Twain because we would have a pilot that would come board the ship and tell me where to steer.

19:29.350 --> 19:34.796
so that we would miss the bad spots.

19:35.377 --> 19:44.707
There were times when we got grounded and we had to work our ways out and this made it more fascinating.

19:44.727 --> 19:55.138
And this was a very charming and delightful way to spend my time.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.616
We saw a photograph a moment ago.

19:57.676 --> 19:59.198
Maybe we can put it back on the screen.

19:59.258 --> 20:05.287
This was actually a photograph of, not the one you were on, but a depiction, there it is right there, of an LCS.

20:05.788 --> 20:14.100
This is what we talked about that you were involved, that you were on during the invasion of Okinawa, landing craft support.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.644
This is much like that.

20:16.824 --> 20:19.908
The LCS is much like an LCI.

20:20.710 --> 20:23.033
And when we were going down the...

20:23.485 --> 20:29.591
tributaries to the Mississippi, we would bring LCI's many times down the river.

20:29.771 --> 20:38.801
Sometimes LSTs, landing ship tanks, which were the big 350-foot amphibious craft.

20:39.201 --> 20:49.071
And also, we would sometimes tie together several LCTs, landing craft tanks, and take them down the rivers down to New Orleans.

20:49.321 --> 20:58.132
Not a very large ship, this landing craft, 158 feet in length, about 28 feet wide, and on that you fit six officers and 65 enlisted men.

20:58.352 --> 21:00.675
That's the one that we went to Okinawa on.

21:00.715 --> 21:02.437
Right, with Okinawa.

21:02.458 --> 21:03.238
I want to move on.

21:03.619 --> 21:14.012
After World War II, like we said in the beginning, you came home to Giddings, you finished high school, you went to college at Texas Lutheran College, and then on to Southwest Texas State.

21:14.228 --> 21:17.713
And then you went to med school at UT Galveston.

21:17.733 --> 21:20.157
And eventually to Vietnam.

21:20.177 --> 21:21.579
And I want to go ahead and get there.

21:21.619 --> 21:25.345
I know that you became a flight surgeon at Fort Sill.

21:25.465 --> 21:29.271
Vietnam in 1967 and 1968 as a doctor there.

21:29.832 --> 21:31.995
Talk a little bit about that experience.

21:32.115 --> 21:38.044
Obviously, you saw a lot of images, a lot of the horror of war that you'll never forget.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.708
Well, actually...

21:41.566 --> 21:44.430
I felt very good about Vietnam.

21:46.513 --> 21:51.000
I was able to, and I had two jobs.

21:51.140 --> 22:10.088
I was both the division surgeon and I was the battalion commander of the medical battalion and under my command I had four clearing companies and a helicopter medevac ambulance detachment.

22:10.878 --> 22:27.842
Since I had learned to fly before I got to the division, the chief of staff found out about it and told the medevac detachment commander, whenever the doc's in your plane, let him be your co-pilot.

22:27.882 --> 22:30.325
And so we got around a lot.

22:30.345 --> 22:34.131
And I had a very good year in Vietnam.

22:35.212 --> 22:40.159
And like I said, I had a smart and

22:40.595 --> 22:56.197
diligent, gung-ho group of young doctors and when we first got there, one of the problems was what they called wet lung syndrome.

22:57.258 --> 23:09.876
The patients were going to the surgical hospitals and they would operate on them before they resuscitated them and the

23:10.717 --> 23:25.680
injured would go in shock while they were on the operating table and it would have the fluids back up into the lungs and that's the reason they called it wet lung syndrome.

23:25.700 --> 23:38.901
So our doctors and I worked out this system that when our medevac helicopters picked up an injured, we would not take them immediately to the

23:40.180 --> 23:41.421
surgical hospitals.

23:41.441 --> 23:47.027
We would bring them to our own aid stations and we would do four cut downs.

23:47.047 --> 24:06.188
We would do one on each limb and on two of the limbs we would run in whole blood and then on the other two limbs we would run in ringers lactate which is a substitute for blood whenever we don't have enough blood and so

24:06.539 --> 24:24.733
This worked very well and we would bring the patients around and they could then go on to the surgical hospitals and we found that in this fashion that wet lung syndrome went away and many of the surrounding divisions

24:25.118 --> 24:34.110
caught on to what we were doing and they began to emphasize resuscitating the patient before they were sent to the surgical hospitals.

24:34.130 --> 24:38.816
So essentially you were developing methods of saving lives that otherwise may have been lost.

24:38.836 --> 24:41.520
Yes, it's a very interesting situation.

24:41.680 --> 24:50.772
One night we were coming back from Fontiette and we were probably 50, 60 miles from our home base when they

24:51.157 --> 25:02.128
radioed us and said that there was a casualty en route and as a matter of fact it must have been just almost directly below us and so we landed and

25:02.648 --> 25:09.338
I picked up the man and examined him and I could find no pulse, no blood pressure.

25:09.478 --> 25:17.389
His eyes were rolled back in his head and I, for all circumstances, he appeared to be dead.

25:17.409 --> 25:21.174
But we radioed ahead and they were ready for us.

25:21.275 --> 25:26.462
And when we landed, it was like a beehive of activity.

25:27.033 --> 25:34.227
They had the man, they gave him the four cut downs and resuscitated him.

25:34.287 --> 25:44.367
And in less than five minutes, they had him sitting up and while they were suctioning blood off of his chest, he was fighting them.

25:44.819 --> 25:52.890
And so it was a remarkable event that was very gratifying to me to see what we had accomplished.

25:52.970 --> 26:00.361
And we saw this young man go on to the surgical hospital and recuperate and live.

26:01.542 --> 26:05.528
I want to mention you were commander of your medical battalion in Vietnam.

26:06.183 --> 26:08.486
We've just got a couple of minutes left after Vietnam.

26:08.506 --> 26:09.988
You went to the Middle East, Africa.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.070
You went to jump school.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.273
You actually have 65 jumps to your credit.

26:13.513 --> 26:13.813
Yes.

26:13.893 --> 26:15.836
That's part of the adventure in you.

26:15.856 --> 26:20.763
You wanted more adventure, so you decided to learn how to jump out of perfectly good airplanes.

26:20.783 --> 26:31.577
I did that beforehand, yeah, before I ever went through training.

26:31.837 --> 26:32.258
Right.

26:32.660 --> 26:37.145
Talk about, just in the minute or so we have, what led you to now.

26:37.185 --> 26:44.472
You went to Brook Army Medical Center, and then you went out to California and practiced for 20 years, and now you've been in Bryan College Station area for four years.

26:44.552 --> 26:47.735
Tell people what you're doing right now, sort of in semi-retirement.

26:48.416 --> 26:58.026
I work with a lady that does urine drug tests and blood alcohol tests.

26:58.765 --> 27:05.532
We work for various firms like Halliburton and Knife River, large trucking firms.

27:05.552 --> 27:14.120
And so I do the physical examinations for the bus drivers and truck drivers that they employ.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.705
And this keeps my hand in and it's very interesting work.

27:19.325 --> 27:26.072
I'm also the medical review officer that whenever there is a positive

27:26.643 --> 27:40.264
urine drug found, they send it to me and I interview the patient and find out if he has a valid prescription that would account for his having

27:40.615 --> 27:41.957
the positive test.

27:41.977 --> 27:42.999
All right.

27:43.019 --> 27:44.041
Thank you for your service.

27:44.061 --> 27:46.505
We're out of time, but thank you for what you do.

27:46.525 --> 27:47.467
It's a pleasure to know you.

27:47.928 --> 27:56.803
This is one of those stories of service that could fill volumes, and through his love of writing, Rex Davis' experiences in service to his country will be there for us to read forever.

27:57.004 --> 28:00.229
But you get the idea that he'll be around to write a lot more.

28:00.550 --> 28:01.852
We salute Dr. Rex Davis.

28:02.413 --> 28:03.876
I'm Tom Turbeville.

28:03.896 --> 28:05.779
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
