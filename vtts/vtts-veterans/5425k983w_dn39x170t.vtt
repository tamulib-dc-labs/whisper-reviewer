00:30.958 --> 00:33.563
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.924 --> 00:35.185
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:35.941 --> 00:41.891
Texas A&M has sent many a former student to combat from the Spanish-American War to the War on Terror.

00:42.411 --> 00:52.768
Many from the classes of the 50s and the 60s served in Vietnam, including Lieutenant Colonel Durwood Lewis, F-4 backseater, who saw a great deal of combat in his 12-month assignment.

00:52.748 --> 00:57.096
one year out of more than 20 years of service to the United States Air Force.

00:57.136 --> 00:59.340
Meet Durwood Lewis of College Station.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.664
Durwood, it's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:01.724 --> 01:02.365
Let's start off.

01:02.385 --> 01:07.054
You're a Somerville guy, a Somerville yay wall guy, graduated from A&M in 1960.

01:07.094 --> 01:15.669
Talk a little bit about College Station and Texas A&M and sort of what it was like in the 50s, late 50s in 1960 as they got closer to the Vietnam War.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.372
Well, when I was in

01:17.588 --> 01:18.669
A student at A&M.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.852
A&M was like being on Wake Island.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.177
There was nothing here to speak of.

01:24.477 --> 01:28.883
We had the North Gate, the South Gate, and then you could go to Bryan.

01:29.924 --> 01:33.569
But for the most part, it was the campus.

01:34.370 --> 01:39.658
And we could go to movies, and that was just about the extent of our entertainment.

01:40.258 --> 01:42.541
It took us two or three hours to get to Houston.

01:42.782 --> 01:44.464
It took us four hours to get to Dallas.

01:45.445 --> 01:47.528
Two or three hours to get to Waco.

01:48.217 --> 01:51.201
and a couple hours to get to Austin.

01:51.221 --> 02:05.497
So when I was in the Air Force flying with Mac, we would stage out of Wake Island, and Wake Island's just one little two and a half mile island out in the middle of the Pacific, and it was very much, I told everybody, it reminded me of College Station.

02:05.517 --> 02:07.359
College Station was Wake Island.

02:07.379 --> 02:16.951
Before we forget, I want to mention one of the veterans that we've had the honor of having on this show is Lewis Hudson from World War II, and you said that Lewis was actually your principal and your scoutmaster when you were young, right?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.072
That's correct.

02:18.406 --> 02:23.772
Him and Boots Simmons and there was a lot of those guys.

02:23.952 --> 02:26.936
Mr. Dwight Look that came back from World War II.

02:26.976 --> 02:29.939
Those were all my heroes when I was growing up.

02:29.959 --> 02:30.540
Right.

02:30.560 --> 02:36.867
You went to Air Force ROTC, went to pilot school, washed out at pilot school, but then you went to Navigator School in Harlingen.

02:36.887 --> 02:43.014
Sort of take us from your graduation from Texas A&M and sort of how your entry into the military and how that went.

02:43.274 --> 02:45.056
Well, as you indicated, I went to pilot school.

02:45.116 --> 02:46.978
I was there for nine months and I washed out.

02:47.363 --> 02:50.087
and then they sent me to Navigator School.

02:50.107 --> 03:00.422
It was interesting, in my Navigator class, I think all of us except one guy had washed out of pilot school, so we weren't real happy campers.

03:02.646 --> 03:07.853
But, you know, we accepted it and did our best in Navigator School and did fairly well.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.280
Navigator School at that time was about a 10-month program.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.885
When we graduated from there, we had two choices.

03:16.574 --> 03:19.298
We could either go to, actually we had three choices.

03:19.939 --> 03:21.421
You could go to bomb nav school.

03:22.383 --> 03:28.091
You could go to RIO school, which is radar intercept officer, backseaters and fighters.

03:28.111 --> 03:33.299
Or you could go to EWO school, electronic warfare officer.

03:34.301 --> 03:39.589
Well, what I knew about electricity was that when you turn the light switch on, the light came on in the ceiling.

03:40.490 --> 03:43.915
So I opted to go to navigator bomb school.

03:45.143 --> 03:48.588
which was about a seven month program.

03:48.608 --> 03:53.176
And I didn't realize at the time, but the first six weeks was electronics.

03:53.656 --> 03:56.281
I knew I was an accounting major.

03:56.301 --> 04:00.928
So I had to learn about electronics and mathematics and all this stuff.

04:01.349 --> 04:09.221
You know, basic electricity, vacuum tubes, something that probably nobody around me today knows what a vacuum tube is.

04:09.602 --> 04:13.007
But that was before transistors.

04:13.645 --> 04:22.141
We had these huge amplifiers in the bomb nav system that we had to know when something went wrong with the radar.

04:22.161 --> 04:23.624
We had to be able to fix it in flight.

04:24.586 --> 04:30.237
So that was one of the big parts of Navigator Bomb School was knowing the system.

04:30.402 --> 04:31.344
Right, right.

04:31.966 --> 04:39.383
You went on, I know, to Travis Air Force Base in California, flew C-135 cargo planes there.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.192
And this was right about the time that people were getting a knowledge of Vietnam.

04:43.212 --> 04:47.803
And your first really taste of Vietnam came then when you were at Travis.

04:47.783 --> 04:56.994
and you were flying what were called sort of missions to Hickam in Honolulu.

04:57.034 --> 04:57.915
Talk about that.

04:57.935 --> 05:04.983
Well, what we were doing was the C-135s were the only jet transport on the West Coast.

05:06.004 --> 05:09.869
And at that time, as you indicated, most of the action was in Vietnam.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.631
Most people didn't know about Vietnam then.

05:11.671 --> 05:15.175
I got there to Travis in late 62.

05:15.577 --> 05:17.659
And most people couldn't spell Vietnam.

05:17.759 --> 05:19.120
I didn't know that much about it.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.261
I read a little bit about it.

05:21.642 --> 05:26.566
But I'd say 90% of our missions, we flew global.

05:27.387 --> 05:29.969
We had two navigators and three pilots on our crew.

05:31.470 --> 05:35.293
So we could have a crew duty day of 27 hours.

05:35.314 --> 05:45.482
So a typical mission, we would take off from Travis, fly to Honolulu, which is about a five-hour flight, two hours on the ground to refuel,

05:45.901 --> 06:13.495
and flight plan, and we'd fly from there to the Philippines, which was about a 10 or 11 hour flight, and then we'd crew rest, or we'd turn our airplane over to another crew, they would fly to Saigon, or Da Nang, or Cam Ranh Bay, or somewhere like that, then go to Japan, or either they'd come back to Travis, and then the next airplane came through, we'd had our crew rest, we'd pick it up, and we'd go to

06:14.082 --> 06:23.511
And then we'd either come back to the Philippines or go to Japan, and it was just hit or miss as to whether you went home or you flew a couple of shuttles.

06:23.752 --> 06:23.952
Right.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.154
This was called staging, and you did this until 1965.

06:26.795 --> 06:29.858
And then your military career took kind of a turn.

06:29.958 --> 06:34.883
You were assigned to Puerto Rico, and you were a hurricane hunter, a fascinating part of your career.

06:34.903 --> 06:35.844
Talk about that.

06:35.864 --> 06:36.865
It was fascinating.

06:36.905 --> 06:44.072
I'd spent two and a half years at Travis, and one of my jobs was to avoid weather.

06:44.373 --> 07:10.819
in that airplane using radar so all of a sudden we're looking for bad weather and you know all of us it was a brand new outfit so every one of us were new to this business and the culture of everybody there was we don't want to do this you know this is dumb and so we had to actually

07:11.423 --> 07:15.228
determine the procedures for doing it because nobody had ever done it before in C-130s.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.793
That's what we were flying there at C-130Bs.

07:18.813 --> 07:29.408
So we just took the documents for the airplane and decided what the documents said was the best altitude to fly in the bad weather was 10,000 feet.

07:29.428 --> 07:33.473
So that suddenly became the smart thing to do.

07:33.493 --> 07:36.958
So we penetrated hurricanes at 10,000 feet and we

07:37.242 --> 07:40.306
I can't remember what our airspeed was, but it was in the dash one.

07:40.826 --> 07:42.288
We determined what airspeed to fly.

07:42.969 --> 07:45.572
So I was a young captain.

07:46.594 --> 07:48.436
I was the daddy navigator.

07:48.496 --> 07:49.577
I was the senior guy.

07:50.498 --> 07:53.122
There was one guy senior to me, but he was a stand-of-vile guy.

07:53.642 --> 07:58.008
So I was the scheduler and the trainer of all those navigators.

07:58.028 --> 08:02.694
There was only about 10 of us, but I was responsible for all those guys.

08:03.675 --> 08:06.338
And all of a sudden I learned...

08:07.263 --> 08:10.491
what they had taught me at A&M about accepting responsibility.

08:10.511 --> 08:19.753
I mean, it took me, most people learned it a lot younger, but it took me to being a captain before I realized what they were really trying to teach me when I was at A&M about responsibility.

08:20.037 --> 08:23.542
You talked about this time, how you saw a lot of things that you had not seen before.

08:23.562 --> 08:27.367
You did this for three years or four hurricane seasons, actually.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.891
You flew a lot around what's known as the Devil's Triangle at the Sargasso Sea.

08:31.672 --> 08:35.377
Talk about that and talk about the phenomenon which you saw, which is called St.

08:35.417 --> 08:36.358
Elmo's Fire also.

08:36.378 --> 08:36.538
Yeah.

08:37.059 --> 08:41.505
Well, you know, sometimes when you get into weather, you build up a static charge on the airplane.

08:42.586 --> 08:46.071
And you get this phenomenon called St.

08:46.131 --> 08:46.752
Elmo's Fire.

08:46.972 --> 08:49.335
It's written about in...

08:49.822 --> 08:51.644
the ancient mariner.

08:51.664 --> 09:05.900
It frightened those sailors and in 1965 it frightened Durwood Lewis because I remember I was back there doing my navigation stuff and the pilot said, Durwood, come up here and take a look.

09:05.940 --> 09:11.806
I get up out of my seat and I look out the window and I went, whoa, and the airplane was glowing.

09:12.066 --> 09:15.390
There was this bluish, greenish

09:16.045 --> 09:20.410
funny-looking glow on the props, on the wings.

09:20.430 --> 09:23.013
It took me back.

09:23.053 --> 09:28.779
I didn't really know what it was when I first saw it.

09:28.819 --> 09:29.660
And somebody said, St.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.301
Elmo's Fire.

09:30.361 --> 09:35.487
And I remembered what I'd learned in high school literature about St.

09:35.507 --> 09:36.148
Elmo's Fire.

09:36.288 --> 09:38.570
The wings and props were actually glowing green, right?

09:38.590 --> 09:39.231
Right.

09:39.251 --> 09:40.232
That's what you saw.

09:40.392 --> 09:42.415
Glowing, ghostly-looking green.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.517
We were in weather.

09:45.020 --> 09:50.988
So it even glowed more than it normally would because it was reflecting off of that moisture in the air as well.

09:51.809 --> 09:58.478
So it was really, I won't say frightening, but it made an impression.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.240
We could do a whole show on that.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.847
Talk about the typhoon that you went through called Victoria and all that, which was an especially scary one.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.129
But I want to move on.

10:07.379 --> 10:10.843
You went back to Travis Air Force Base, 141s.

10:11.184 --> 10:19.574
Talk about that because that was sort of a job to where you transported people, you transported VIPs over to Vietnam.

10:20.054 --> 10:24.920
But then those C-41s would change into air vac almost flying hospitals too.

10:24.980 --> 10:29.406
I know this was something that was very meaningful for you and it really sort of brought the war home for you.

10:30.106 --> 10:31.508
It really did.

10:31.648 --> 10:33.150
You know, when you see...

10:33.367 --> 10:42.517
young guys that were just beat up and crippled and all kinds of terrible wounds.

10:42.557 --> 10:44.599
And we would fly them up.

10:44.879 --> 10:47.582
In those days, it's not like they do now in Iraq.

10:48.303 --> 10:57.152
They would stabilize them and take care of them for quite a while in Cameron Bay and other major hospital areas.

10:57.993 --> 11:01.517
And then, once they were ready to transport,

11:02.054 --> 11:10.787
We'd pick them up in Cameron Bay and take them to Japan for probably more extensive care until they were ready to go back to the States.

11:11.308 --> 11:12.310
So we were picking them up.

11:13.191 --> 11:14.573
We weren't picking up critically.

11:15.855 --> 11:23.607
They'd gotten over the critical part of their injuries, but they were still banged up pretty bad, and they still needed a lot of care, and we would fly them.

11:24.397 --> 11:34.507
You know, we had flight nurses, and in some cases we had doctors on board because we had some pretty critical guys in there that we were taking back.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.508
Right.

11:35.528 --> 11:49.842
So it made a big impression on me because I felt like I was not doing my part, you know, that I was pretty safe, and I just felt guilty.

11:49.862 --> 11:54.066
I was drawing my pay, you know, and getting flight pay and all this, and it just didn't seem like I was earning it.

11:54.248 --> 11:57.192
Well, and you did something about that, as a matter of fact.

11:57.212 --> 12:00.997
You began to feel somewhat unchallenged, sort of, as you were as a navigator.

12:01.037 --> 12:06.243
And sort of talk about your conversion over to another aircraft, to the F-4.

12:06.263 --> 12:10.409
Well, as I told you, I walked out of the squadron one day, and there was two F-4s sitting on the ramp.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.952
And I asked somebody, how do you get into those things?

12:12.992 --> 12:14.814
I understand they only fly in about four hours.

12:16.777 --> 12:20.281
And whoever I was with said, you've got to be nuts or crazy.

12:20.301 --> 12:21.623
And I said, well, I qualify.

12:22.649 --> 12:30.779
So I actually made a call to the personnel at headquarters of Military Airlift Command, and I said, how do you get an F-4s?

12:30.819 --> 12:32.601
And they said, well, we're looking for F-4 guys.

12:33.282 --> 12:36.526
If you'll volunteer, we'll see what we can do.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.067
So I had to change my dream sheet.

12:38.107 --> 12:41.131
We called it the dream sheet, what you want to do in your career and all this stuff.

12:42.272 --> 12:45.737
And he told me to mail it to him, so I mailed it to him.

12:45.757 --> 12:48.640
In the meantime, I went on a trip to the Far East,

12:49.582 --> 12:59.662
When I got back, my wife picked me up at base office, and she said, I got a call from military airlift headquarters, and they wanted to know if you wanted to leave in three weeks or six weeks.

13:00.243 --> 13:04.772
That's the first I heard that it got through that quick.

13:05.461 --> 13:06.763
I did for six weeks.

13:06.883 --> 13:07.203
Indeed.

13:07.223 --> 13:17.817
You went to Florida, learned to be a backseater in an F-4 backseater, which a weapons systems officer, WSO, or I also learned from you, they're also called GIBS, which stands for guy in the backseat.

13:17.917 --> 13:19.579
Right, right.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.480
Which is pretty simple.

13:21.341 --> 13:21.441
Yeah.

13:21.501 --> 13:27.829
Volunteered to go to Vietnam, and you served in Vietnam as an F-4 backseater from December to December 1971 to 1972.

13:28.090 --> 13:33.156
Talk about what your mission there, what your job was there, just generally what happened in that year.

13:33.136 --> 13:55.158
Well, again, by this time, I had made major, and I was still a young major, and there was two major navigators in my squadron, and again, the other major was senior to me, so he was a stand-of-vowl guy, so I became Daddy Gibb, and so I was responsible for training.

13:55.939 --> 14:01.084
Even though I was the newest guy on the block, because I was a major, I was responsible.

14:02.245 --> 14:10.015
And so I, you know, I became the navigator scheduler.

14:10.235 --> 14:11.157
Right.

14:11.177 --> 14:17.986
And that was kind of an interesting thing because you wanted to schedule the right guys for the particular missions you were flying.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.210
And you'd ask about what kind of missions we flew.

14:22.431 --> 14:28.600
When I first got there, we were essentially doing most of our missions in Laos.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.223
And we were flying...

14:31.726 --> 14:37.433
gunship escort missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail at night.

14:38.234 --> 14:44.962
So the first about three months, I was a night fighter.

14:44.983 --> 14:46.605
I hardly saw the daylight.

14:47.165 --> 14:59.060
We'd fly about a five-hour mission, and what we would do is we'd get with one of these gunships, and when they took anti-aircraft fire, we'd suppress it with bombs.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.463
So if a gun came up,

15:02.236 --> 15:07.844
We would bomb that gun and usually just play around with them a little bit because it was hard to hit one at night.

15:07.904 --> 15:11.569
You just have to shoot at their tracers or bomb at their tracers.

15:11.609 --> 15:13.031
Right, right.

15:13.051 --> 15:22.724
I asked you some of your particular missions that you remember and you talked about one time where you all were just sitting around, not much going on, and you were told to get in your F-4 and take off quick.

15:22.965 --> 15:28.152
You were given some pictures as far as what your target was, and that turned into a memorable mission.

15:28.652 --> 15:29.514
Take us through that.

15:29.534 --> 15:30.555
Well, is it?

15:31.075 --> 15:32.277
The mission was scheduled.

15:32.637 --> 15:36.102
We were supposed to bomb some targets in southern North Vietnam.

15:37.484 --> 15:43.192
And I can't remember if it was after the briefing or after we'd gone out to the airplanes.

15:43.232 --> 15:44.934
They canceled the mission because of weather.

15:46.216 --> 15:50.082
And they put us on what was called QRF, Quick Reaction Force.

15:51.263 --> 15:53.266
And so we went ahead and cocked the airplane.

15:53.566 --> 15:55.469
In other words, we got the airplane ready to go.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.572
And then we went back to the squadron and

15:57.822 --> 16:03.088
thought we would just sit around for the rest of the morning and then they would cancel that too.

16:03.108 --> 16:09.275
About nine o'clock, they came running in and said, you've got to ASAP go as soon as possible.

16:09.295 --> 16:10.816
You know, we'd jump in the airplane.

16:12.698 --> 16:14.240
The front seater's cranking the engines.

16:15.021 --> 16:17.203
And I'm sitting back there in the back seat.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.184
Where are we going?

16:19.125 --> 16:20.627
You know, he didn't know and I didn't know.

16:20.767 --> 16:27.795
And about that time, our ops officer crawled up the ladder and handed me some pictures.

16:27.877 --> 16:33.547
And he showed me the target and the coordinates of the target were written on the picture.

16:34.929 --> 16:46.368
So I, quick like a bunny, pulled out my charts and started drawing lines to get to the target because first we had to refuel, then we had to go from refueling to the target.

16:46.388 --> 16:52.178
We didn't have a control time, which is fortunate because then I didn't have to back off of what time we had to be able to target.

16:52.739 --> 16:53.901
We just had to hit the target.

16:55.737 --> 17:01.162
So the pilots get in the airplane and we're taxiing out and he's he yells at me.

17:01.182 --> 17:02.283
He wants to see the picture.

17:02.503 --> 17:04.164
Of course, he's got to see it too.

17:04.184 --> 17:07.968
So it's hard to describe the distance between the front seat and the back seat.

17:08.008 --> 17:10.410
It's not like we're not like this.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.253
It was and I had to kind of make a little paper airplane and sail it up to him.

17:14.393 --> 17:14.914
Right.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.497
And land in his lap and he would taxi the airplane.

17:18.517 --> 17:22.160
I didn't have the I couldn't taxi because I couldn't see.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.782
And he was taxing the airplane and studying the pictures.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.955
About that time, we got out the arming area.

17:27.975 --> 17:28.516
They armed us.

17:28.796 --> 17:38.531
When they arm you, you've got to have your hands visible so you don't drop something on them or shoot some of the forward shooting ordnance at the crews.

17:39.873 --> 17:42.577
So then we took off.

17:42.597 --> 17:44.139
As soon as we took off, we had to refuel.

17:44.199 --> 17:48.746
About that time, it was one of these deals where nothing was going right.

17:48.766 --> 17:51.911
One of the airplanes, we were a four-ship, aborted.

17:52.151 --> 17:53.453
So we were down to a three-ship.

17:55.525 --> 18:05.380
As soon as we took off, my front-seater, who was my squadron commander, Roger Myram, says, Durwood, you take the airplane and let me look at these pictures.

18:05.420 --> 18:15.895
So I'm flying the airplane back there, and he's looking for pictures, and I realized that my throttle linkage was disconnected.

18:16.857 --> 18:18.399
All I could do was advance the throttle.

18:18.439 --> 18:19.881
I couldn't retort them.

18:19.901 --> 18:21.263
So every time I had to...

18:22.255 --> 18:25.681
take some power off, I'd have to tell him to take off a couple.

18:26.662 --> 18:28.465
So then we have the tanker, he refuels.

18:30.989 --> 18:33.373
We get off on the wing and the other two guys are refueling.

18:34.235 --> 18:36.198
Pilots and navigators have to talk with their hands.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.265
And so he told me to fly.

18:40.866 --> 18:44.692
So I'm flying the airplane, he's still studying, studying the pictures.

18:44.712 --> 18:49.039
And every time we started slipping back, I was okay, I could forward.

18:49.778 --> 18:52.687
push the swallows forward to inch up on the tanker.

18:53.689 --> 19:00.008
But every time we'd start slipping by, I'd start going forward, I'd have to ask him for it.

19:00.028 --> 19:01.392
So I was interrupting him

19:01.793 --> 19:04.880
It was just a mess, you know.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.702
I'm going to stop you there.

19:05.722 --> 19:12.336
We're going to go to some pictures, then we're going to come back to that mission because that mission got even more interesting after that.

19:12.376 --> 19:18.410
There are some pictures that Lieutenant Colonel Lewis supplied to us, and we're going to go through them real quick, and we're going to start early.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.815
There you are as a Texas A&M.

19:21.352 --> 19:21.752
Cadet?

19:22.493 --> 19:22.854
Junior.

19:23.134 --> 19:23.475
Junior.

19:23.875 --> 19:24.195
Right there.

19:24.235 --> 19:25.697
So that would have been about 1959.

19:25.917 --> 19:26.458
Yes.

19:26.478 --> 19:26.818
All right.

19:26.899 --> 19:27.499
Good haircut.

19:27.619 --> 19:28.040
All right.

19:28.541 --> 19:29.121
I had hair.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.584
You were a bigger fellow back then, too.

19:32.265 --> 19:32.525
All right.

19:32.545 --> 19:33.046
Let's move on.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.510
This was a parade in Fort Worth.

19:36.570 --> 19:39.313
This was when Texas A&M was playing TCU, I guess.

19:39.353 --> 19:42.237
And this was a core march through downtown Fort Worth.

19:42.297 --> 19:43.318
I thought that was very interesting.

19:43.819 --> 19:45.120
And that's you right there.

19:45.361 --> 19:46.382
Front right.

19:46.582 --> 19:48.304
Front right.

19:48.537 --> 19:49.979
of that company right there.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.921
And you can see the date, October 17, 1959.

19:53.562 --> 19:55.184
All right, let's move on.

19:55.424 --> 19:56.185
Talk about this.

19:56.205 --> 19:57.527
That's my navigator class.

19:58.908 --> 20:04.414
It's interesting, the guy kneeling on the, as you're looking at the picture on the far right, kneeling, he's an Aggie too.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.858
Bob Gretzel, he was class of 59.

20:08.498 --> 20:14.245
And then on the front row, the two guys in the front row on the other side were Burmese officers.

20:14.445 --> 20:14.745
I see.

20:15.186 --> 20:18.409
One of them had been a guerrilla fighter during World War II.

20:19.368 --> 20:22.492
The rest of them were all these guys that washed out of pilot school.

20:22.592 --> 20:22.813
Right.

20:23.273 --> 20:25.977
You're back row, third from the right, the tall one.

20:25.997 --> 20:26.477
That's correct.

20:26.497 --> 20:27.138
Yeah, there you are.

20:27.158 --> 20:28.059
Okay, let's move on.

20:30.743 --> 20:34.628
That is my squadron when I was in Southeast Asia.

20:34.648 --> 20:39.655
The 469th Attack Fighter Squadron at Karat Royal Tower Air Base, Thailand.

20:40.015 --> 20:40.296
Right.

20:40.996 --> 20:44.181
And that's me in the back row, I think, third from the right.

20:44.201 --> 20:44.962
Third from the right.

20:44.982 --> 20:45.402
There you are.

20:45.963 --> 20:46.984
Back row, third from the right.

20:47.345 --> 20:48.987
Okay, move on.

20:49.338 --> 20:51.641
There you are on the left, and that's your front seater.

20:51.721 --> 20:54.864
That's my front seater, Argyle P. Atwood from Georgia.

20:55.124 --> 20:55.345
Right.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.068
He went to school at the University of Georgia.

20:58.188 --> 20:59.149
Really good pilot.

20:59.409 --> 21:01.151
I mean, fine pilot.

21:01.231 --> 21:03.514
I would go anywhere with him.

21:03.534 --> 21:04.655
Fairwood, you were a big old boy.

21:04.695 --> 21:07.558
You filled up that back seat, didn't you?

21:07.578 --> 21:07.698
I did.

21:07.718 --> 21:09.921
This is actually, this picture was taken.

21:09.941 --> 21:11.222
We're about to crawl up a ladder.

21:11.423 --> 21:11.623
Right.

21:11.643 --> 21:12.624
I mean, go on a mission.

21:12.664 --> 21:14.586
I can't remember which one it was, but I know.

21:15.494 --> 21:16.135
We were getting ready.

21:16.155 --> 21:18.858
You can see my helmet on the wing.

21:18.938 --> 21:23.443
And you can see the Mark 82 500-pound bombs right under my helmet.

21:23.463 --> 21:23.844
Yes, sir.

21:24.785 --> 21:25.626
All right, next picture.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.690
This was a happy day.

21:30.171 --> 21:32.494
I took this picture on my last combat mission.

21:32.614 --> 21:34.996
We were coming in to land at Karat.

21:36.038 --> 21:38.561
And we were a four-ship, and I was in number three.

21:39.822 --> 21:41.003
And I took that picture.

21:41.043 --> 21:44.447
We were on initial approach.

21:44.467 --> 21:45.028
All right.

21:46.223 --> 21:55.698
That's just a picture that I took when we were on a strike mission and one of the airplanes was on the tanker.

21:55.778 --> 22:00.365
We had just refueled and I just thought it was kind of an interesting picture.

22:00.626 --> 22:02.569
Exactly.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.752
Amazing picture that you took.

22:04.772 --> 22:05.213
There you are.

22:05.373 --> 22:08.178
That's me again about to saddle up and go.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.805
I had a front seat named John Carr that brought his camera.

22:13.342 --> 22:14.544
And he took that picture.

22:15.105 --> 22:19.232
And as soon as he took the picture, I got in the airplane and we took off and flew a mission.

22:19.953 --> 22:20.274
All right.

22:22.858 --> 22:23.519
Talk about this.

22:23.659 --> 22:28.728
This is one of my favorite pictures.

22:29.009 --> 22:29.970
It's Thud Ridge.

22:31.473 --> 22:36.281
We had just... We were on an escort mission.

22:36.301 --> 22:37.543
We had escorted some...

22:38.468 --> 22:39.770
some chaff bombers.

22:39.790 --> 22:43.917
One of them had gotten shot down by a MiG, and when I took that picture, we were chasing a MiG-21.

22:44.097 --> 22:51.048
Our number three had just shot a MiG-21 down, and we were chasing the other one.

22:51.248 --> 22:55.936
We were down on the deck, and you can't see it there, but they were shooting at us.

22:56.076 --> 23:00.603
We were over the Red River, and they were shooting at us, and I may have been upside down when I took that picture.

23:00.623 --> 23:01.725
I'm not sure.

23:01.925 --> 23:05.969
But that ridge that we're looking at that goes from top left to down right, that actually points.

23:05.989 --> 23:06.770
Points at Hanoi.

23:06.810 --> 23:07.691
Points at Hanoi.

23:07.791 --> 23:10.034
So that was your navigation tool.

23:10.154 --> 23:22.206
The reason it's called Thud Ridge is because in the early bombing missions against Hanoi, the F-105s, we call them thuds affectionately because that's the noise they make when they hit the ground.

23:22.226 --> 23:25.550
And they use that to shield them from the radar.

23:25.850 --> 23:30.235
They come in on one side of that thing or the other and they would kind of shield them from the sounds.

23:31.116 --> 23:31.476
All right.

23:31.827 --> 23:32.368
Next picture.

23:33.929 --> 23:34.710
That's a celebration.

23:34.830 --> 23:41.558
That's after I just completed what we call an EOT, End of Tour Mission.

23:42.639 --> 23:44.160
And we were celebrating a little bit.

23:45.782 --> 23:46.123
Okay.

23:48.465 --> 23:51.288
And this is kind of a sad day, actually.

23:51.308 --> 23:55.252
That was the last mission I flew in the Air Force in Alaska.

23:55.272 --> 23:55.793
In Alaska.

23:56.110 --> 23:59.934
Didn't realize that there was going to be anybody with a camera there when I came back.

23:59.954 --> 24:00.495
At Elmendorf?

24:00.735 --> 24:02.497
Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.

24:02.677 --> 24:03.037
Yes, sir.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.021
A dreary day.

24:07.903 --> 24:08.563
Amazing pictures.

24:08.583 --> 24:12.708
We don't have a whole lot of time, but I want to go back to that mission.

24:12.828 --> 24:17.453
You were flying, and all of a sudden, you got a SAM warning light that a missile was coming at you.

24:17.873 --> 24:25.341
Actually, we had a SAM warning, and what happens is when the SAM is launched, the antenna is exposed, and they're talking to that missile.

24:26.401 --> 24:30.806
and we picked that signal up, and we get a red light that says launch.

24:31.207 --> 24:42.621
Well, at the same time, we had another light that says A slash S, which meant asthma sector, which meant that not only did we have a launch, but that radar was painting our airplane.

24:43.201 --> 24:44.623
So we were the target.

24:46.225 --> 24:50.530
So the procedure at that point is to scan and try to find the missile.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.673
You've got to find it to defeat it, see it.

24:53.434 --> 24:56.037
And as I scanned through the area, I saw...

24:56.303 --> 25:02.454
the SAM, I could see where it launched at our, what I'd call our 12-30 position.

25:03.776 --> 25:10.568
And I told the pilot, I said, well, I've got a SAM at 12 o'clock and it's guiding, which meant it's on us.

25:11.370 --> 25:19.965
You know, it's like, if I can talk with my hands again, it's like the missile is coming and every time our airplane moves, that missile was moving with us just like it was in formation.

25:21.802 --> 25:25.327
My pilot, Colonel Myram, didn't say anything.

25:26.269 --> 25:31.877
I had so much confidence in him that I didn't really think too much about it because he didn't talk that much.

25:33.299 --> 25:39.268
I kind of watched and I said, Sir, it's still guiding.

25:39.508 --> 25:42.272
He still didn't say anything.

25:42.452 --> 25:48.501
It looked like to me it was going to come right through the canopy and hit me between the eyes and I ducked.

25:49.443 --> 25:54.628
And when I ducked, there's an ejection handle between my legs and there's another rope over my head.

25:54.868 --> 25:58.992
I put my hand on both of them because I thought I might be going for a walk that day.

26:00.454 --> 26:07.861
And so when I ducked, I put my hands on both those ejection handles in case I had to get out.

26:09.843 --> 26:15.168
And about the time that I ducked, Colonel Myron pulled about six or eight Gs.

26:15.188 --> 26:19.112
I don't know which, but whatever it was, I was wearing this helmet.

26:19.717 --> 26:25.303
which weighed a couple pounds, and then when you pull six Gs, that multiplies by six.

26:25.423 --> 26:26.344
Yes, sir.

26:26.364 --> 26:36.955
And so I was totally doubled over, couldn't see anything, and about that time I heard the Sam, and I heard our wingman say, lead your hit.

26:38.317 --> 26:41.721
You know, which I knew, he didn't have to tell us we were hit, I knew we were hit.

26:43.002 --> 26:48.728
But I couldn't move, because he was still, you know, pulling all his Gs.

26:49.822 --> 26:56.553
When he came off of it, you know, I looked back and I could see our smoke trail.

26:56.573 --> 27:00.179
I could see the detonation from the SAM and our smoke trail went right through the middle of it.

27:01.021 --> 27:11.819
And, you know, I was looking around the cockpit looking for fire warnings or something and, you know, my squadron commander who was flying the airplane says, you know, we're hit.

27:12.059 --> 27:13.922
I said, Roger that.

27:14.780 --> 27:17.545
And he said, stay with me or something like that.

27:17.565 --> 27:19.228
And I said, don't worry, I'm right here.

27:19.368 --> 27:20.329
You know, I'm not going anywhere.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.792
We're just about out of town.

27:21.832 --> 27:24.396
But the end of that story is that you went ahead and hit your target.

27:24.456 --> 27:25.839
You got back to Thailand.

27:25.859 --> 27:27.101
You got back safely.

27:27.121 --> 27:29.244
It was an incredible, incredible experience.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.108
You were out of Vietnam in December of 1972.

27:31.248 --> 27:34.874
And your career took you to Little Rock, to Holloman.

27:34.894 --> 27:36.737
It took you eventually back to Travis to...

27:37.358 --> 27:45.230
Elmendorf in Alaska, and then after you were out of the service, I know you were 16 years at Texas A&M, and believe it or not, we're out of time.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.313
There's so much more to tell, but we are out of time.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.395
But thank you for your service.

27:48.675 --> 27:49.056
Yes, sir.
