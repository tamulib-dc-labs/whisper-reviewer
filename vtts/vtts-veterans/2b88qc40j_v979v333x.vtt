Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:24.369 --> 00:25.431
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:26.390 --> 00:37.603
The early morning hours of June 6, 1944, the dawn of D-Day, hours before sunrise and the beach invasion at Normandy, came the paratrooper drop behind the beaches.

00:37.623 --> 00:46.734
Between them, the Americans and the British flew some 1,000 transport planes, and one of those was a C-47 piloted by Colonel Paul W. Stevens.

00:46.754 --> 00:53.562
Paul Stevens served his country as a flyer, and for more than three years of his long service, witnessed the war in Europe from his cockpit.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.406
His is a fascinating story.

00:55.426 --> 00:58.877
Please welcome to Veterans of the Valley, 90 years young.

00:59.144 --> 01:02.347
Paul W. Stevens, Texas A&M class of 1938.

01:02.968 --> 01:05.270
Paul, it's an honor to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:05.951 --> 01:13.058
September the 10th of 1916, you were born in Temple, 90 years ago plus now, and you came to Texas A&M in 1934.

01:13.418 --> 01:17.922
First thing I wanted to ask you is what was Texas A&M like in the mid-30s?

01:17.942 --> 01:19.524
What was the campus like?

01:19.564 --> 01:21.286
What was the atmosphere like here?

01:21.526 --> 01:27.632
Well, it looked rather sparse and unkempt, if you want to know.

01:28.304 --> 01:30.346
Like the drill field was kind of rough.

01:30.366 --> 01:30.847
Right.

01:31.027 --> 01:36.353
And it wasn't too impressive, in other words.

01:36.714 --> 01:37.194
Right.

01:37.214 --> 01:39.577
Well, it was a military school full of guys.

01:39.637 --> 01:40.238
That's right.

01:40.258 --> 01:41.760
So I guess it didn't have to be too impressive.

01:41.780 --> 01:43.402
All male, all in uniform.

01:43.422 --> 01:43.822
You bet.

01:43.882 --> 01:44.783
And you were one of them.

01:44.803 --> 01:45.945
You graduated in 1938.

01:46.205 --> 01:51.291
You told me that you went to work for a steel fabricating company in Waco, and you were

01:51.727 --> 01:55.794
you were making a lot of steel that was going to, for military purposes.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.536
So you sort of- Camps all over the country.

01:57.577 --> 02:00.682
So you sort of realized what was coming just from what you were doing in work.

02:00.722 --> 02:04.408
Sort of talk about that and what that caused you to go ahead and do.

02:05.770 --> 02:09.516
Well, as you say, it was pretty plain we were headed for war.

02:10.323 --> 02:13.489
So I was married and had a young daughter.

02:14.952 --> 02:23.809
I'm working in Waco, and I decided that, well, it would make good sense if I go ahead and volunteer a one-year

02:23.992 --> 02:40.988
active duty that FDR had offered, which I did, and my wife wasn't too pleased with it, but it worked out better than we thought, because I went up to Wichita Falls, Texas, where a new air base was being built.

02:41.170 --> 02:46.276
and participated in that from the military side, accepting buildings.

02:47.297 --> 02:59.831
In fact, I'd inspect a new dormitory and I'd walk out the door after the inspection and the troops would be lined up out in front to march in every time the dorm was finished.

03:00.772 --> 03:02.955
But it was an active time actually.

03:04.216 --> 03:08.241
But I was also working with a bunch of

03:08.423 --> 03:19.681
former Army Air Corps check pilot or test pilot teaching training in San Antonio, flying training.

03:19.701 --> 03:26.773
And they ribbed me until I finally agreed to apply for flight training, which didn't take long to come back.

03:26.933 --> 03:35.106
And so my wife and I experienced some strange things then by having to move quite often.

03:35.947 --> 03:54.128
So we rigged our automobile to carry a baby bed on top in a knockdown, of course, in a box and pile all our belongings that we would need and move from base to base during basic training, primary training, and advanced training.

03:54.448 --> 03:54.568
Right.

03:54.588 --> 03:55.509
Three different places.

03:56.511 --> 04:00.035
All out in the California, Arizona area.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.156
Right.

04:01.176 --> 04:01.296
Right.

04:01.613 --> 04:19.690
Having completed that successfully and having been going through in the grade, started out as a first lieutenant, but our promotion to a captain came through while I was in primary training from the previous job I'd had in Wichita Falls.

04:20.868 --> 04:23.992
It made my life much easier.

04:24.032 --> 04:28.418
I did not have to take the military training that the cadets had to take.

04:29.359 --> 04:32.262
All I had to do was be there to fly for half a day every day.

04:32.563 --> 04:32.943
Right.

04:32.963 --> 04:35.787
You were a captain, but you were being instructed by some second lieutenant, right?

04:35.807 --> 04:36.428
Absolutely.

04:37.189 --> 04:37.769
Absolutely.

04:37.849 --> 04:40.733
Because they knew how to fly and I didn't.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.315
So you paid attention to them.

04:42.435 --> 04:44.037
It come very naturally, really.

04:44.097 --> 04:49.103
It's just one of those things, I guess, that happened.

04:49.283 --> 04:49.523
Right.

04:49.623 --> 04:55.991
First plane you flew, I think, in basic training was a single-engine biplane, which we have a photo of later on that we're going to talk about.

04:56.031 --> 04:56.812
Oh, very good.

04:57.332 --> 04:58.714
Yeah, right.

04:58.874 --> 05:00.416
You came back to Texas for active duty.

05:00.436 --> 05:04.781
You thought you were going to be sent somewhere else, but it turns out you stayed right here at home.

05:04.801 --> 05:08.425
I came right back to Austin and found that the base wasn't ready for us there.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.242
Yeah, at Bergstrom.

05:09.783 --> 05:10.405
At Bergstrom.

05:11.548 --> 05:22.819
We moved up to a place in Missouri and did our final checkout in the C-47 airplanes.

05:23.035 --> 05:24.877
C-47, it was made by Douglas.

05:24.897 --> 05:26.079
This was your airplane.

05:26.119 --> 05:29.362
This is what you flew during the war as a transport pilot.

05:29.382 --> 05:31.665
Talk a little bit more about that plane.

05:31.685 --> 05:32.406
It's fascinating.

05:32.426 --> 05:34.609
It was originally built as a commercial airplane.

05:34.629 --> 05:36.611
It was a passenger airplane, small door.

05:37.792 --> 05:41.477
For paratroopers, we had to have a larger door on it so they could jump clean.

05:42.718 --> 05:50.207
Had to have a heavier floor on the end of the airplane, strength-wise, to take the load that the paratroopers wanted with them.

05:50.761 --> 05:55.508
And this all ended up causing it to have larger engines on it than the commercial airline.

05:57.571 --> 06:01.597
And there was some undoubt of the other changes, but those were the major ones.

06:02.639 --> 06:04.542
And it was a nice airplane to fly.

06:04.562 --> 06:05.243
It really was.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.446
It wasn't fast.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.250
We couldn't cross the country in one hop.

06:10.271 --> 06:11.833
You have to stop and lay over.

06:13.115 --> 06:14.717
But we did a lot of that.

06:16.119 --> 06:17.882
But we were putting together a...

06:19.263 --> 06:25.835
group of C-47s, a group meeting four squadrons and a headquarters for the group.

06:25.855 --> 06:33.790
And they selected a place for that over in North Carolina, right on the South Carolina border and near the Pacific Atlantic Ocean.

06:35.373 --> 06:40.562
And so our training into that airplane allowed us to fly out over the ocean

06:41.065 --> 06:45.752
and looked for submarines, German submarines, while we were flying airplanes, learning to fly.

06:46.874 --> 06:51.060
So that was interesting, but never saw one.

06:52.602 --> 06:57.770
And having got that over with, we began to fill up the group.

06:58.631 --> 07:00.193
And I was in the 4th Squadron.

07:01.876 --> 07:07.083
I'm sorry, the 47th Squadron of this group.

07:08.005 --> 07:09.587
I was the operations officer

07:11.002 --> 07:20.387
and all the key people were former airline pilots who had been called to duty on the acceptance of work.

07:21.548 --> 07:25.414
But all the rest of us were pretty young, actually, compared to the airline pilots.

07:26.635 --> 07:28.758
And I appreciate that, too.

07:28.778 --> 07:29.680
Indeed.

07:29.700 --> 07:38.512
So after finishing that training and having the group pretty well assembled, we were ready to do whatever we were supposed to do.

07:38.532 --> 07:41.076
So they wanted us to go over to

07:42.322 --> 07:49.070
Africa as Rommel was being pushed out of the north coast of Africa.

07:50.391 --> 08:10.894
So our airplane wouldn't fly across the Atlantic's direct, of course, and we had to go down through the islands of the South and the Caribbean, and then into Brazil, stopping along at such places as the mouth of the river, Big River,

08:11.836 --> 08:20.778
And then one leg over to the nearest point in Africa, the nearest point in Brazil, to Africa.

08:20.798 --> 08:28.697
From there we could fly to an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean called Ascension Island.

08:28.717 --> 08:29.980
It's just a big rock.

08:30.820 --> 08:40.229
But the engineers had knocked places for us to park the airplanes around and had a little runway on it that was more uphill than it was level by far.

08:41.731 --> 08:43.292
But that was a rest stop.

08:44.073 --> 08:49.419
And from there I went on into Africa and out around the rubber plantations.

08:51.260 --> 08:57.807
And from there I went up to Morocco.

08:58.698 --> 09:04.506
moved over to a place called Ujda, which was a little more to the east.

09:04.526 --> 09:14.559
And there we waited for Rommel to be cleared out completely all the way to Cairo, which occurred rather rapidly.

09:14.579 --> 09:19.005
And then we moved, squatted up to a wheat field in Tunisia.

09:19.906 --> 09:24.773
And preparing for dropping paratroopers in Sicily.

09:24.888 --> 09:25.489
Indeed.

09:25.509 --> 09:29.693
The invasion of Sicily was, I guess, really the first campaign that you were directly involved in.

09:29.713 --> 09:34.158
That was the first troop carrier drop of major size.

09:34.418 --> 09:34.698
Right.

09:35.539 --> 09:39.023
And it was very interesting because we did it at night.

09:40.745 --> 09:44.889
You're flying at night in formations that scared in itself.

09:44.969 --> 09:53.038
But approaching Sicily, all of a sudden, just a wall of fire appeared climbing into the sky as

09:53.626 --> 10:00.336
the enemy on the ground was firing away, but we were somewhat distant away when that happened.

10:01.338 --> 10:04.743
But as we approached, that firing began to die down.

10:05.664 --> 10:12.275
And what was happening is our fighter pilots were strafing all these gun placements on the ground.

10:13.336 --> 10:21.709
By the time we got there, with very little, relatively speaking, so we made our drop rather easily, and with some of the

10:22.550 --> 10:26.034
Some of the bunch that was dropping did get shot up some.

10:26.375 --> 10:26.955
Right, right.

10:26.975 --> 10:28.197
You talked about the second drop.

10:28.217 --> 10:29.298
The first drop went pretty smooth.

10:29.318 --> 10:30.580
Then the second drop came.

10:30.660 --> 10:31.901
The second drop.

10:31.922 --> 10:41.894
I didn't go on that one because on the first drop, my squadron commander broke down because he lost to pilot.

10:42.374 --> 10:44.777
That was a close friend of his.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.119
And so he had to be relieved.

10:46.139 --> 10:48.642
And so I was made the squadron commander at that time.

10:50.005 --> 10:54.291
So the boss told me to stay and let the rest of the guys go.

10:56.354 --> 11:02.763
But they run into some trouble, some squadrons more than others, because they were flying over.

11:03.985 --> 11:11.195
The merchant marines were unloading freight on the beaches where we had to cross over into Sicily.

11:12.276 --> 11:16.682
And they had just been strafed and bombed by the Germans.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.645
And they were very trigger happy.

11:19.537 --> 11:23.541
And so they shot down Americans just the same as the Germans.

11:23.561 --> 11:25.103
Yeah, it was a friendly fire situation.

11:25.123 --> 11:26.144
Friendly fire, that's correct.

11:26.164 --> 11:27.906
It turned out quite tragic.

11:28.086 --> 11:38.338
I want to move on, but I know that you spent a lot of that time after that moving troops back and forth from the east coast to the west coast of Africa, from Casablanca to Cairo.

11:38.378 --> 11:40.340
I set up an airline back at Tunis.

11:41.481 --> 11:45.586
And I flew them from Casablanca to Cairo and from Cairo back to Tunis.

11:45.646 --> 11:49.510
Anything that's going on in between there, we deliver passengers or whatever.

11:49.490 --> 12:00.928
You told me it was during your time there in Tunisia at Tunis that you got to witness one time from afar a little bit, but you were there when the big three arrived, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.

12:00.948 --> 12:04.253
We had our squadron air echelon only.

12:04.293 --> 12:14.169
The ground people were back on Sicily, but we were holed up in the ammunition storage buildings.

12:14.590 --> 12:15.431
Right.

12:15.451 --> 12:16.172
And...

12:17.367 --> 12:28.185
But anyway, I started out to get to one of my buildings where the MPs were all over the place and they stopped me and wouldn't let me go out there.

12:28.846 --> 12:36.439
But I could stay where I was and I could see the operations office building, I should say, further down the strip.

12:37.347 --> 12:41.874
And suddenly these bigger airplanes come landing in down there.

12:41.955 --> 12:46.642
And so I found out that it was a meeting of the big three taking place.

12:46.763 --> 12:51.851
And Churchill and... And Roosevelt and Stalin.

12:51.991 --> 12:54.255
Stalin and Roosevelt all there.

12:54.616 --> 12:55.397
Right.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.522
That must have been a sight that you'll never forget.

12:58.822 --> 13:00.385
There was quite a lot going on.

13:00.685 --> 13:01.406
I want to move on.

13:01.426 --> 13:03.228
We're going to have some photographs here in just a second.

13:03.248 --> 13:09.197
But then in the spring of that year, that's when you moved on to England to get ready for what would be the invasion of France.

13:09.277 --> 13:12.461
It was actually, yes, the spring of the next year.

13:12.481 --> 13:12.721
Right.

13:12.741 --> 13:13.823
You were stationed in the Midlands.

13:13.843 --> 13:16.647
Sort of talk about what that was like and what that atmosphere was like.

13:16.667 --> 13:24.137
Well, when we arrived in England, the base was built, but the buildings were Quonset huts.

13:24.558 --> 13:26.260
I don't know whether you know what a Quonset hut is.

13:27.802 --> 13:28.583
Sure.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.933
But it was prepared for us, and it was very fortunate, I guess, to find it.

13:32.993 --> 13:34.479
Of course, we moved right inside.

13:34.519 --> 13:37.268
We were no longer in tents.

13:38.854 --> 13:41.222
But our training was rather stiff.

13:42.097 --> 13:48.867
and that we had to do a lot of dropping of paratroopers to train the boys for the next big drop that we knew was coming.

13:50.489 --> 14:04.249
And of course, the British were doing bombing Germany by the night, and we had airplanes dragging right across the treetops, coming in and going out, across the airbase, wherever they wanted to go.

14:05.330 --> 14:10.838
Whereas our bombers then were working from high altitude in daytime bombing.

14:10.818 --> 14:11.419
Right.

14:11.439 --> 14:15.368
So you spent a lot of the rest of the winter in the spring working with the terror troopers.

14:15.708 --> 14:24.707
I think it's a good time to break and let's go to some photographs and sort of see what some of the things that we've been talking about and then we'll come back and talk about Normandy and the invasion and after that.

14:24.727 --> 14:27.493
So let's go ahead and go to some of the photographs that

14:27.929 --> 14:29.853
Colonel Stevens has provided for us.

14:30.073 --> 14:31.195
You can look right there and see.

14:31.235 --> 14:35.182
Now, that's a young and somewhat older Stevens.

14:35.202 --> 14:37.767
The one on the left is you as a Texas A&M student, right?

14:37.787 --> 14:38.589
Yes, that's right.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.773
That's a uniform for a cadet at A&M.

14:40.793 --> 14:45.582
Well, that would have been taken in about, I guess, your senior year, maybe, 1938?

14:45.662 --> 14:48.307
No, that would be with a blue collar.

14:48.327 --> 14:49.288
That was the first year.

14:49.509 --> 14:50.030
Oh, first year.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.613
So you were a fish.

14:51.633 --> 14:51.793
Yeah.

14:51.976 --> 14:52.739
So 1934.

14:52.779 --> 14:54.265
There you go.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.763
And then we move on, I guess, closer to your retirement time, obviously on the right.

14:58.895 --> 15:01.318
Yes, that was pretty well downstream.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.800
Good-looking soldier in both pictures.

15:03.860 --> 15:05.602
Well, okay.

15:05.622 --> 15:06.023
Yes, sir.

15:06.163 --> 15:07.424
I'll agree with you on that.

15:07.444 --> 15:07.945
Absolutely.

15:08.225 --> 15:08.746
Absolutely.

15:08.806 --> 15:09.507
Handsome soldier.

15:09.787 --> 15:12.069
Okay, let's move on.

15:12.089 --> 15:17.455
This is a Christmas card, but this is a picture of the biplane where you first learned how to fly, right?

15:17.736 --> 15:20.459
Yes, that's very much like the Stearman.

15:21.340 --> 15:22.641
Two-place...

15:23.650 --> 15:25.272
Open cockpits.

15:26.294 --> 15:30.540
And, of course, the colors there, but which we did not have on our airplane.

15:30.560 --> 15:30.800
Right.

15:30.961 --> 15:33.204
Well, this is a Christmas card, so it's supposed to look great.

15:33.264 --> 15:38.111
And those airplanes or that type of airplane are still used quite extensively in crop dusting.

15:38.371 --> 15:38.772
Yes, sir.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.955
Oh, yeah, you see them all the time, especially around this area.

15:41.396 --> 15:42.537
You sure do, down south.

15:43.278 --> 15:44.660
Okay, let's move on to the next picture.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.022
That's a beautiful Christmas card, by the way.

15:46.323 --> 15:50.308
Here's a C-47, and I believe you are on the far left of this picture.

15:50.328 --> 15:51.430
Talk about what we're looking at.

15:51.848 --> 15:56.354
Well, that's just some of the officers of the squadron.

15:57.296 --> 16:00.220
I could make out my deputy next to my name.

16:02.643 --> 16:02.924
Well.

16:04.205 --> 16:04.886
And the rest of the group.

16:04.906 --> 16:09.052
And the rest of them are officers that held various positions in the squadron.

16:09.553 --> 16:09.753
Right.

16:09.773 --> 16:15.882
We had to have a supply officer and a best officer and all these sort of things.

16:16.098 --> 16:20.585
Got another photograph, a little bit wider shot of this aircraft, and you can get an idea of the wingspan.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.108
Oh, that gets a squadron in it now.

16:22.408 --> 16:27.036
Yeah, that's the whole squadron and underneath the entire wingspan of the C-47.

16:27.056 --> 16:32.185
Yeah, that's about 108 feet or something like that.

16:32.205 --> 16:34.548
108 feet from tip to tip.

16:34.569 --> 16:35.490
Quite an airplane.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.182
It turned out to be a very substantial airplane.

16:39.202 --> 16:40.985
It would take a lot of beating.

16:41.066 --> 16:46.777
One time I saw one of them had come back from a drop where there's pretty fierce fighting.

16:47.879 --> 16:52.489
And you could drive, theoretically, drive a Jeep from wingtip to wingtip.

16:52.609 --> 16:54.192
There wasn't any cab there.

16:54.212 --> 16:54.593
Oh, my goodness.

16:54.893 --> 17:00.903
The pilot's cockpit was up there, and the tail structure was up there, but there's nothing above the wing.

17:00.923 --> 17:02.245
And it had been shot away in between.

17:02.265 --> 17:03.507
Been shot away.

17:03.688 --> 17:06.232
Okay, let's move on.

17:06.612 --> 17:07.794
This is a fascinating picture.

17:07.814 --> 17:10.118
You described a moment ago sort of the formations.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.541
Yes, the formation is.

17:11.961 --> 17:13.925
Three plane formations in groups of nine.

17:14.145 --> 17:14.826
That's correct.

17:14.806 --> 17:17.109
And just one after another.

17:17.950 --> 17:20.713
And this is a photograph of a drop.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.417
You can see the paratroopers coming.

17:23.437 --> 17:28.964
I don't know whether that's already dropped or had a late jumper or was it an early jumper.

17:29.264 --> 17:29.584
Right.

17:29.604 --> 17:30.906
I would say it's a late jumper.

17:31.066 --> 17:31.887
Exactly.

17:31.907 --> 17:33.149
Exactly.

17:33.169 --> 17:34.370
I think we've got another picture.

17:34.390 --> 17:35.492
But the big invasion.

17:36.493 --> 17:38.896
Now this to me is just an incredible photograph.

17:38.996 --> 17:42.180
Yeah, you can see a paratrooper coming out there, I think.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.232
You said that, yes sir, right below the airplane, that's it.

17:45.252 --> 17:47.536
And they came out fast, about two per second, right?

17:47.556 --> 17:54.528
He comes through that door and the chute is automatically pulled for him.

17:55.009 --> 17:55.470
Yeah.

17:55.490 --> 17:56.672
A cable does that.

17:56.692 --> 17:57.433
Right.

17:57.453 --> 18:01.300
And he swings once and comes back and touches the ground.

18:01.803 --> 18:05.376
Because you said this is only an altitude of about 900 feet, right?

18:05.396 --> 18:05.918
900 feet.

18:06.158 --> 18:06.901
That's not very high.

18:07.102 --> 18:07.282
No.

18:07.764 --> 18:09.410
Some wanted us to go even lower.

18:09.651 --> 18:09.932
Right.

18:09.952 --> 18:10.674
And some did.

18:10.955 --> 18:11.477
Right.

18:11.497 --> 18:12.601
But that was hazard.

18:12.621 --> 18:13.163
You drag it.

18:13.447 --> 18:15.870
You can brag somebody on that, pretty easy.

18:16.090 --> 18:19.134
And some who didn't know better wanted you to go slower.

18:19.395 --> 18:21.217
We'll talk about that in a little bit, too.

18:21.337 --> 18:22.398
That's kind of a funny story.

18:22.438 --> 18:24.861
Let's move on and finish up the pictures.

18:25.122 --> 18:25.883
Talk about this.

18:25.903 --> 18:29.988
This is you, and you're receiving an award, and that's in France, is that right?

18:30.008 --> 18:35.996
Yes, that's the Frenchman awarding us each Croix de Guerre award.

18:36.176 --> 18:41.142
That's one of their rather general awards, I think.

18:41.459 --> 18:47.399
You have the red star, the gold star, and the silver quadigares.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.205
They're all in various stages.

18:49.225 --> 18:50.329
Right.

18:50.349 --> 18:52.958
But anyway, we were all awarded a quadigare.

18:53.219 --> 18:53.359
Uh-huh.

18:55.381 --> 19:03.331
The Frenchman wanted to do something for the people who came in there and made the first landing.

19:03.492 --> 19:06.856
That's just a few of the photographs that we have time for.

19:07.257 --> 19:14.666
Let's talk about D-Day and Normandy and getting ready because it's a fascinating story.

19:14.686 --> 19:20.494
June 6, 1944, and you were piloting the C-47 and had some paratroopers that you

19:20.947 --> 19:25.571
that jumped out of your plane behind the beaches at Normandy.

19:26.011 --> 19:28.714
Sort of talk about that day and what you remember of it.

19:28.734 --> 19:35.740
Well, of course, we made our swing around, so we were coming back from the south to the north, you might say.

19:37.221 --> 19:39.083
And so we'd be south of Cherbourg.

19:44.408 --> 19:50.633
Well, the first pass, the first night of it,

19:50.798 --> 19:52.981
We didn't get much trouble.

19:53.001 --> 19:56.605
There were some, I won't say, some that got hit.

19:56.645 --> 19:57.927
I'll say there was lots of trouble.

19:58.608 --> 20:02.032
But we didn't lose many airplanes at the first time.

20:05.456 --> 20:10.663
But on the second run, the next night, early morning it would be,

20:12.517 --> 20:15.724
We had lots of ground fire on us.

20:15.984 --> 20:22.357
We were dropping supplies to the spots where we had dropped the paratroopers.

20:22.377 --> 20:31.656
And many airplanes were lost and I was unfortunate enough to lose an engine on that.

20:33.155 --> 20:40.395
I found my oil pressure was going to zero suddenly, so that meant my engine was about to burn up, so I shut it down.

20:40.415 --> 20:42.260
But the propeller wouldn't stop turning.

20:42.361 --> 20:47.535
It was swinging in the wash, meaning I was pushing a whole barn door along with me.

20:48.477 --> 20:54.406
and we'd already had bundles drop from underneath it, and each one of those bundles had a windbreak on it.

20:54.426 --> 21:03.579
It was a drag break, not that big around, just a big concave plate to keep the bundles from getting knocked off by a slipstream.

21:04.881 --> 21:07.625
And that was real slow on them, really slow to slip.

21:07.645 --> 21:13.093
We'd stagger along about 90 miles an hour all the way across.

21:13.995 --> 21:16.999
It was tough, but anyway, when I lost an engine,

21:18.059 --> 21:20.543
I wasn't going to fly back.

21:20.623 --> 21:23.087
It was gradually losing altitude.

21:24.049 --> 21:28.036
And my radar operator had taken a bullet through the leg, through his knee.

21:29.518 --> 21:33.325
And he was crippled up and knocked out with drug right away, of course.

21:36.430 --> 21:37.852
But I said, we're going to have to ditch.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.595
The airplane's not going to go back.

21:41.026 --> 21:47.193
So I went around the back of all the ships in there and looking for one with a red cross on it.

21:48.014 --> 21:52.960
While I was doing that and was getting lower and lower, I thought, the waves underneath us are just rolling.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.483
I had a pretty big wind that night, as you know.

21:56.865 --> 22:05.975
And I said, well, that won't do it all because if we hit that water with those bottle protectors underneath, it's going to nose us right to the bottom and nobody will get out.

22:06.516 --> 22:06.696
Yes, sir.

22:07.283 --> 22:12.860
I said, well, I can turn that engine on and burn it up and maybe stop that prop from turning.

22:14.464 --> 22:15.327
It wouldn't feather.

22:15.748 --> 22:16.711
It would only turn.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.061
So we agreed and I started

22:20.817 --> 22:28.287
We started the engine up, and in a little bit, the crew chief, while we were on fire, well, yes, we were on fire, because I was burning the engine up.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.971
But all of a sudden, the airplanes shudder, and the props stopped.

22:33.493 --> 22:37.318
But it was still flat in the wind, but it wasn't turning.

22:37.338 --> 22:40.883
So I shut the thing down and started getting a little altitude.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.905
We could get up 900 feet or so.

22:43.907 --> 22:48.192
And I could see the English coast cliffs over there, so I just headed for them.

22:49.150 --> 22:53.920
We got on over there and found the airport and landed on it.

22:54.341 --> 22:54.903
Yeah, you landed.

22:54.943 --> 23:01.617
That's another kind of humorous story because you landed at this strip and the commander, the British commander wasn't real happy.

23:01.677 --> 23:02.760
He didn't like it a bit.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.103
It was a fighter unit then.

23:04.163 --> 23:08.492
Of course, the fighter unit was up over the peninsula fighting.

23:08.928 --> 23:13.697
And he was screaming at me about, why did I land on his airport?

23:13.717 --> 23:15.360
I told him, well, I couldn't go any further.

23:15.421 --> 23:17.284
I had to land.

23:18.246 --> 23:19.368
Well, go somewhere else.

23:19.388 --> 23:20.190
Why did you do this?

23:20.210 --> 23:22.073
So I got kind of angry with him.

23:22.093 --> 23:23.356
What did you tell him?

23:23.436 --> 23:24.057
You set him straight.

23:24.077 --> 23:25.600
What did you tell him?

23:25.720 --> 23:29.147
I set him straight by telling him, look,

23:29.127 --> 23:31.431
This airport belongs to me as much as you.

23:31.992 --> 23:33.335
The U.S.

23:33.355 --> 23:34.657
has paid for the airport.

23:35.178 --> 23:38.184
They're actually paying you and all your people.

23:38.745 --> 23:44.976
I said, now I don't like that a bit for you to fuss at me about using it to save my skin.

23:45.513 --> 23:52.682
So I said, now I want you to take your administrative airplane and fly my crew up to my base.

23:53.483 --> 23:55.226
And he'd just come apart.

23:55.486 --> 23:58.590
But he did and flew us back to the base.

23:58.670 --> 24:03.436
And the boy that was shot through the knee was picked up and taken off to a hospital.

24:03.476 --> 24:04.838
And I didn't see him again.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.439
And you were late.

24:05.459 --> 24:06.520
They thought that you were gone.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.962
They thought that you were gone.

24:08.002 --> 24:08.943
They'd even replaced you.

24:09.043 --> 24:12.607
They had already designated a new commander for the squadron.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.348
Right.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.029
But you took that.

24:14.049 --> 24:15.651
But we took care of that right quick.

24:16.352 --> 24:17.553
Right.

24:17.573 --> 24:25.503
Later on, you would do more drops in the European theater over Holland in what is known as Operation Market Garden.

24:25.563 --> 24:26.203
Yes.

24:26.223 --> 24:28.586
And other drops also.

24:28.786 --> 24:29.047
Yeah.

24:29.067 --> 24:29.307
Right.

24:30.063 --> 24:33.011
Market garden was very easy for us.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.759
We didn't have any problem.

24:35.779 --> 24:43.380
We made our drop across a river that we wanted to protect the bridge there.

24:45.132 --> 24:48.096
But the British didn't move up fast enough.

24:48.116 --> 24:53.783
And of course, we all say, well, they stopped for tea, but they didn't move up.

24:55.145 --> 25:00.231
But I think the troops still saved the bridge until the British got there the next day.

25:00.452 --> 25:01.253
Right, right.

25:01.333 --> 25:07.401
Operation Market Garden is the campaign that there was a book and even a movie made called A Bridge Too Far.

25:08.342 --> 25:12.187
That was what that was about.

25:13.969 --> 25:14.650
Yeah.

25:15.372 --> 25:21.125
You had not fired a shot until you decided that in this war you were going to fire your gun.

25:21.165 --> 25:22.147
Talk about that.

25:22.407 --> 25:28.541
So I took my .45 pistol out, pulled the window back in the cockpit, stuck it out there.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.423
And there's a flak tower.

25:29.443 --> 25:31.146
A whole German flak tower went by.

25:31.227 --> 25:32.790
I fired it one time.

25:33.682 --> 25:36.405
Because you wanted to say you'd fired... I fired one shot in the war.

25:36.425 --> 25:37.847
You fired one shot in the war.

25:38.788 --> 25:45.016
You spent just over three years in Europe during this campaign, and then you finally went home.

25:45.036 --> 25:52.365
You were in Iceland, I think you said, when you found out about the Japanese bombing of Hiroshima.

25:52.425 --> 25:52.765
That is correct.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.667
Trailing on each other out of Scotland, too.

25:54.708 --> 25:58.692
We got up to Iceland, and the weather was bad from there to Labrador.

25:58.913 --> 25:59.233
Right.

25:59.770 --> 26:03.715
And this C-47, we were bringing them back, the C-47.

26:03.875 --> 26:11.103
And there's a long haul from Iceland to Labrador, and there's a point of no return.

26:11.184 --> 26:15.609
And once you go there, you go on, or you don't come back.

26:15.629 --> 26:16.590
Right.

26:16.610 --> 26:19.393
But we had to have good weather to do that.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.155
So we were hung there for about a week.

26:21.536 --> 26:21.816
Yes, sir.

26:21.836 --> 26:23.398
Bad spell.

26:23.378 --> 26:26.282
Both bombs went off in Japan.

26:27.424 --> 26:32.792
So you knew then that the war was probably going to end and you wouldn't have to go to the Far East and continue.

26:32.832 --> 26:35.776
We knew we were headed for the Far East.

26:36.357 --> 26:37.318
There's a lot more to the story.

26:37.359 --> 26:39.822
I know that you eventually got back to the United States.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.104
You went to New England.

26:41.124 --> 26:43.828
They took your plane away from you and made you come back home by train.

26:43.848 --> 26:44.509
That's correct.

26:44.658 --> 26:45.319
Yeah, was it?

26:46.882 --> 26:54.714
We were sitting in the straight chairs on that train all night long, getting out to St.

26:54.774 --> 26:55.095
Louis.

26:55.796 --> 26:58.981
We were all tired as we could be, just worn out.

26:59.001 --> 27:01.405
And that's when they finally got you a sleeper car, when you got to St.

27:01.425 --> 27:01.545
Louis.

27:01.565 --> 27:08.116
Well, when we saw the prisoners of war going by us in Pullman's, this just tore us apart.

27:08.777 --> 27:08.877
Yeah.

27:08.857 --> 27:10.519
Colonel Stevens, we are out of time.

27:10.539 --> 27:13.902
There's so much more to your story, but thank you very much for your service and visiting with us.

27:13.922 --> 27:15.664
It's been very interesting to be.

27:15.684 --> 27:16.165
Thank you.

27:16.185 --> 27:17.346
I appreciate it.

27:17.366 --> 27:18.107
