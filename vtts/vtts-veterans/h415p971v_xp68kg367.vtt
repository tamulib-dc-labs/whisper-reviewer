00:07.827 --> 00:30.644
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.044 --> 00:32.046
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.937 --> 00:39.689
Jules Jacquin of College Station is one of many proud Aggies whose education was interrupted by World War II.

00:39.729 --> 00:50.187
But there was plenty to learn in the Army as a member of Company K of the 102nd Infantry Division that swept through France and Belgium and Holland on its way to Germany near war's end.

00:50.656 --> 00:57.463
The war ended for Jules Jacquin in February of 1945 when the building he was in took a direct artillery hit.

00:57.483 --> 01:00.847
He was one of the few survivors who survived that attack.

01:00.867 --> 01:06.473
His is one of many stories of distinguished service, and we welcome Jules Jacquin to Veterans of the Valley.

01:07.114 --> 01:10.057
Jules, it is a pleasure to have you, and first off, thank you for your service.

01:10.077 --> 01:15.764
You were born, you were raised in El Paso, and found your way all the way to College Station to Texas A&M.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.085
Both you and your brother George

01:17.470 --> 01:22.057
I want to talk about that trip first because that was a long, long train ride from El Paso to College Station.

01:22.117 --> 01:24.080
That was a little bit of a culture shock too.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.984
You said they even spoke differently here than they did in El Paso, right?

01:27.004 --> 01:28.507
Yes, they did.

01:28.527 --> 01:31.231
Talk about the train trip and coming to College Station.

01:31.371 --> 01:33.534
You all wanted to be engineers, and that's why you came to A&M.

01:33.574 --> 01:34.135
That's right.

01:34.716 --> 01:45.452
We had it in the back of our minds that we'd like to be engineers, and so my brother and I got on the train, as you said, from El Paso, and I guess it's about

01:45.432 --> 01:50.419
almost 800 miles, 750 miles from El Paso to College Station.

01:51.160 --> 01:57.088
We came through Houston and then boarded the Daylight Express or Sunbeam Express.

01:57.168 --> 02:00.653
It was a very nice train really.

02:00.853 --> 02:07.262
And the BART here at the railroad station that's not any longer here.

02:07.743 --> 02:12.790
And then we just started to go to Texas A&M.

02:13.276 --> 02:18.863
You told me that you all got off the train, you came over to the campus and you asked somebody, well, where do we sleep?

02:18.903 --> 02:24.410
And they said, hey, just grab a bunk, find a dorm and just sleep there and everything will work its way out, right?

02:24.430 --> 02:24.971
That's right.

02:25.031 --> 02:32.140
And I guess we ended up in Law Hall or Puryear Hall, which are not here anymore.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.242
Exactly, exactly.

02:33.582 --> 02:34.824
The war was on by this time.

02:34.844 --> 02:37.588
This was 1942 and the U.S.

02:37.648 --> 02:39.630
was involved in World War II.

02:40.151 --> 02:41.072
And you...

02:41.356 --> 02:57.306
enrolled in the active reserve sort of talk about that why you did that because you could see the writing on the wall you knew that you were going to be serving and that your education would be interrupted that is that's correct and uh we wanted to have at least some kind of uh

02:57.488 --> 03:00.472
decision on our part where we would like to serve.

03:01.333 --> 03:19.656
And the commandants here at Texas A&M, for us students that were not in the program to get commissioned because we were just freshmen really, they recommended we enroll in the enlisted reserves.

03:20.557 --> 03:22.840
And so we did.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.183
And as we expected,

03:25.163 --> 03:28.012
the reserves were called up as a unit.

03:28.635 --> 03:33.089
And we liked that instead of being individuals picked here and there.

03:33.109 --> 03:35.277
So we were inducted.

03:35.297 --> 03:36.119
That was May of 1943.

03:36.802 --> 03:38.447
And you just about finished your first

03:38.900 --> 03:41.743
full year, so they gave you credit for the whole school year.

03:41.863 --> 03:42.244
They did.

03:42.364 --> 03:43.585
I was very thankful for that.

03:43.605 --> 03:44.086
I bet you were.

03:44.106 --> 03:52.536
You were through with your freshman year, and that's when you were inducted, inducted at Fort Sam Houston, immediately sent to Fort Maxey, which is near Paris, Texas.

03:53.096 --> 04:04.850
And then talk about, you had the choice to go receive education-type training at different schools, and you chose Ohio State and another train ride up to Columbus, Ohio.

04:05.330 --> 04:06.932
That's correct.

04:07.317 --> 04:29.173
long ride and for the first time we were seeing different parts of the country and that that was interesting to us right and our train took us to North Columbus and stopped at that big famous Ohio State University

04:29.153 --> 04:30.135
Bowl.

04:30.155 --> 04:30.776
Football stadium.

04:30.796 --> 04:31.557
Football stadium.

04:31.617 --> 04:32.218
Right.

04:32.239 --> 04:36.446
And we stayed in that stadium our first night.

04:36.466 --> 04:37.768
Yeah, you slept in the locker room.

04:37.909 --> 04:39.031
Slept in the locker room.

04:39.532 --> 04:40.213
That was great.

04:41.515 --> 04:49.930
So I guess anytime you see a football game now at Ohio State, that means a little something special to you because that's the night that you spent the night when you got off the train.

04:49.910 --> 04:55.360
But eventually you moved into some housing, some frat houses, right?

04:55.380 --> 04:55.881
Frat houses.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.947
They didn't have any barracks there.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.430
It was not an army post.

05:01.071 --> 05:06.501
And so to quarter us, they took the...

05:06.481 --> 05:12.709
student facilities that were there, the frat houses and sorority houses too.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.151
Right, right.

05:14.171 --> 05:18.877
And Christmas Eve of 1943, you met a lady named Marie Tresimer, I believe is her name.

05:18.897 --> 05:26.907
And after your service in the war, you all were married and you all are still married today and about to celebrate what, 60 years?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.890
60 years coming to September.

05:29.190 --> 05:29.751
Is that right?

05:30.232 --> 05:31.233
That's fantastic.

05:31.253 --> 05:34.497
We'll talk a little bit more about Marie here in a little bit.

05:34.882 --> 05:39.609
That program at Ohio State, it didn't last too very long.

05:39.729 --> 05:40.890
It was ended.

05:40.910 --> 05:47.079
And in February of 1944, you were sent back to Texas near Elgin to Camp Swift.

05:47.099 --> 05:49.723
And that's where the 102nd was formed.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.064
Sort of talk about your time there.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.807
Yeah.

05:53.588 --> 06:02.260
I guess myself with a cadre of what program was, the ASTP program.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.842
Right.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.305
the Army Specialized Training Program.

06:07.425 --> 06:09.007
That's what the ASDP stands for.

06:09.767 --> 06:16.573
And apparently the Army was in great need of foot soldiers.

06:16.593 --> 06:29.604
And so they took a bunch of us from all the schools and put them into operating units, mostly infantry divisions.

06:30.445 --> 06:33.728
And so we filled part of the blanks in there.

06:33.708 --> 06:58.062
yeah so it's pretty much like you described it they were just a provider of manpower they where they needed soldiers they go to camp swift and find the soldiers out of this program well yes the way they had been operating was that they had been using certain divisions like the 102nd right to pick up recruits out of it and so they would hand pick

06:58.042 --> 07:03.130
folks out of it to fill in spots in overseas duty.

07:03.771 --> 07:12.884
And so what they were doing at that time, what they did was to take all of us and staff the division completely.

07:13.265 --> 07:18.293
So it was 100% train it up for a little while and then send it overseas.

07:18.493 --> 07:18.713
Right.

07:18.974 --> 07:22.479
You were headed to the European theater, but your next stop would be Fort Dix, New Jersey.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.482
And you went up there before going to Europe.

07:24.502 --> 07:25.804
But I want you to tell the story.

07:26.037 --> 07:32.787
about when you were at Fort Dix in an operation that you were involved in in Philadelphia.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.329
Talk about the Battle of Philadelphia.

07:34.649 --> 07:35.571
The Battle of Philadelphia.

07:36.332 --> 07:37.453
That was unexpected.

07:38.134 --> 07:44.984
Apparently they had a strike by the operators of the trams.

07:45.004 --> 07:45.605
The streetcars.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.708
The streetcars.

07:47.688 --> 07:55.704
So the operators were afraid of doing their job.

07:56.385 --> 08:06.625
So our division sent some of our people there so that we would ride in the streetcars and

08:07.145 --> 08:14.458
tried to keep any of the Union people that were mad at the folks there calm down.

08:15.099 --> 08:23.995
And it worked very well because they weren't about to get involved against the US Army.

08:24.355 --> 08:25.417
And they were friendly.

08:25.497 --> 08:26.740
They were really friendly.

08:26.860 --> 08:32.089
So the relief people, I guess they were called scabs back then or something like that, who came in to run the streetcars.

08:32.069 --> 08:34.874
who pretty much were stepping over the union lines.

08:34.934 --> 08:37.579
They just didn't want any trouble between them and the union people.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.804
So they brought you all up to keep the peace.

08:39.824 --> 08:40.565
To keep the peace.

08:40.625 --> 08:45.154
And those guys, those people there in Philadelphia, all of them were so nice.

08:45.254 --> 08:49.943
They would feed us and bring us ice cream and whatever we wanted.

08:49.923 --> 08:55.831
Not exactly great training for the Battle of the Bulge, but still it was a... It was a friendly USA.

08:56.472 --> 08:57.693
It was a friendly duty.

08:57.713 --> 08:58.695
That's an interesting story.

08:58.715 --> 09:00.317
You went to England.

09:00.357 --> 09:06.345
Took about 12 days to get across because you all had to zigzag to avoid the enemy submarines, right?

09:06.365 --> 09:07.466
Yes, that is correct.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.712
The zigzags would...

09:11.692 --> 09:18.685
make up a zigzag path that the submarines couldn't wait at a particular place.

09:19.346 --> 09:21.369
So we could try to fool them, I guess.

09:21.490 --> 09:22.812
And finally it got over.

09:23.333 --> 09:29.464
All our troops were ferried over there.

09:29.832 --> 09:36.504
they all came through, and I don't believe there are any boats that were sunk by the submarines.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.205
And going over.

09:37.826 --> 09:44.137
Landed near Weymouth, England, I believe, and it was pretty much fast-tracked to Normandy, to the beach.

09:44.157 --> 09:46.782
Talk about your trip over the channel.

09:46.822 --> 09:53.494
I think you talked about these, describe the rafts that you were talking about, that you got on, that you went ashore in.

09:53.558 --> 09:59.345
Yes, we stayed on the boat overnight there at Weymouth, England.

10:00.065 --> 10:01.948
And so we didn't debark there at all.

10:02.508 --> 10:09.696
So the next morning they shoved off and took us to the Cherbourg Peninsula.

10:10.557 --> 10:16.244
Cherbourg, the harbor itself had been pretty well devastated and bombed out.

10:16.264 --> 10:20.629
So there were really no berthing facilities for the ships.

10:20.609 --> 10:27.236
And so we debarked on big, big rafts.

10:28.317 --> 10:36.145
And the strange thing about it, those rafts were being handled by the German prisoners.

10:36.165 --> 10:45.334
They enlisted, they got the German prisoners and they took care of ferrying us on these rafts to land.

10:46.563 --> 10:54.875
I want to talk about, this was, by my guess, about three months after D-Day that you landed in Normandy, D-Day in the summer.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.557
This was September of 1944.

10:56.717 --> 11:00.602
Sort of describe, if you will, what Normandy Beach was like then.

11:00.622 --> 11:05.529
It was pretty much a supply dump where they were held supplies to fight the war in Europe.

11:05.589 --> 11:06.090
Is that right?

11:06.070 --> 11:07.271
That's correct.

11:07.572 --> 11:14.760
At that point in the situation, the U.S.

11:14.861 --> 11:19.346
did not have a fully operational port in Europe.

11:20.087 --> 11:27.015
And they unloaded stuff like they unloaded us.

11:26.995 --> 11:39.070
shipped it on inland, and then from there, had to move it across Europe to the front, who was there approaching Germany pretty much, pretty closely by that time.

11:39.251 --> 11:43.216
Right, and this was done in trucks, and this was the operation that was known as the Red Ball Express.

11:43.896 --> 11:44.998
You were involved in that, right?

11:45.018 --> 11:45.999
Our division was.

11:46.720 --> 11:56.192
They had folks driving trucks day and night, and the funny thing about it, interesting part about it was that

11:56.172 --> 12:09.512
the Army designated certain roads one way and other roads the other way so that there was no, there were no stops.

12:09.532 --> 12:15.040
And it was just complete travel one way and then return.

12:16.022 --> 12:19.547
So they were one-way highways, really.

12:19.797 --> 12:20.097
Right.

12:20.618 --> 12:28.471
You said that your division was one of the last American divisions that was flanked by the British and you got to work alongside British troops.

12:28.792 --> 12:35.663
And I believe in the newspaper article that was in, you talked about working with the Brits and they were, they were a different lot, but obviously

12:35.643 --> 12:38.768
a brave lot just like the Americans.

12:38.788 --> 12:39.889
Brave lot and friendly.

12:39.909 --> 12:40.170
Yes.

12:41.471 --> 12:42.653
And they call us the Yanks.

12:43.134 --> 12:43.374
Right.

12:43.855 --> 12:46.118
And they were the Brits, right?

12:46.138 --> 12:48.101
And they like their tea.

12:48.281 --> 12:57.114
And they would say, like, take a Jeep and open the radiator petcock, get some hot water and make their tea.

12:57.555 --> 12:57.915
I see.

12:58.236 --> 12:58.516
I see.

12:59.538 --> 13:05.346
You talked quite glowingly, I believe, about when you

13:05.545 --> 13:10.652
you were in Holland and you were moving through Holland about the Dutch people and their plight.

13:11.253 --> 13:17.882
And talk a little bit about that, about the Dutch people and your relationship with them.

13:17.902 --> 13:22.408
Yes, they were really friendly, easy to talk with.

13:23.329 --> 13:25.713
Most of them could speak English.

13:25.733 --> 13:28.456
And that was so easy to communicate with them.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.379
And they had been really starving.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.084
These folks were almost down and out.

13:34.064 --> 13:40.754
Our Air Force had been dropping care packages to them to sustain them.

13:41.656 --> 13:53.794
And as my wife pointed out, the Dutch were using their tulip bulbs for food, but they would not

13:54.331 --> 14:03.542
eat all of the tulip types so they could save one at least to reproduce them later on when the Germans were gone.

14:03.562 --> 14:04.664
When the Germans left.

14:04.684 --> 14:14.996
And Marie told us about how the houses would not have baseboards because they would burn those baseboards to heat up the pots to cook the tulip bulbs.

14:15.597 --> 14:15.957
Yes.

14:15.978 --> 14:20.924
And the baseboards were missing because they would use that as kindling to cook with.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.046
To cook with and also to keep warm.

14:23.286 --> 14:23.747
Right.

14:23.727 --> 14:24.168
Right.

14:25.031 --> 14:31.729
You said you didn't meet a lot of resistance, a lot of combat until actually you had gotten to Holland, but talk about that.

14:31.749 --> 14:39.289
And then I want you to lead us up to your crossing of the Roar River and then through the Battle of the Bulge and in February,

14:39.269 --> 14:42.252
when you were involved in the attack where you were wounded.

14:42.272 --> 14:48.099
So sort of take us, if you will, from that point getting into Holland and up to the Royal River.

14:48.199 --> 14:48.419
Yeah.

14:49.080 --> 14:59.891
Well, I think I mentioned that our division was sort of positioned to go to the north of the American lines.

15:00.472 --> 15:06.238
And so our division ended up on the left flank of our army.

15:06.218 --> 15:26.505
right next to the British, as you mentioned, and pretty soon we were fighting through little towns in Germany and through the Siegfried Line, what was left over of the Siegfried Line.

15:26.485 --> 15:34.775
Eventually, we got to the Rohr River, which in normal times was just a little stream, really.

15:35.716 --> 15:54.298
But the Germans controlled big dams upstream, and they used them to let water flow, let water out, and inundate the valley and make it very, very difficult to go across.

15:54.582 --> 16:22.598
uh by the time they got through they um that that river was like a mile a mile and a half wide right so we had to stop there till they ran out of water and we had been um had been put in to cross at certain dates and the dates were backed up and backed up until february the 23rd that's when we really crossed

16:23.590 --> 16:28.015
February of 1945, talk about what happened that day.

16:28.035 --> 16:45.474
Well, of course there was great artillery barrages and I remember our tanks were lined up in numbers, great numbers on our side of the river.

16:46.075 --> 16:50.880
And actually they were also participating in the artillery barrage.

16:51.468 --> 17:06.693
And I remember going by the tanks, their guns sticking up over our heads, and it was quite a barrage to quiet down the other side of it, yeah.

17:06.713 --> 17:10.219
And you were in a building that took an artillery hit.

17:10.503 --> 17:18.419
Yes, that was after we had crossed and we had moved in about, oh, I'd say a mile.

17:19.281 --> 17:26.976
And then, of course, the Germans were countering, attacking.

17:26.956 --> 17:45.716
the village was pretty well run over by the Germans, and we were in a tight situation, and so we called for our own artillery to hit the same place we were and trying to stop the attacks.

17:46.777 --> 17:55.647
And so we tried to take cover at that time, and the folks that I was with,

17:55.627 --> 18:01.556
We picked a certain building and ran in there, but then it was hit.

18:03.018 --> 18:10.129
So that's lost most of our friends right there, our buddies.

18:10.891 --> 18:17.220
And luckily, I was only what they call a million-dollar wound, so I survived that.

18:17.240 --> 18:17.481
Yes.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.242
Indeed.

18:18.222 --> 18:24.969
I want to mention your brother George was with you in the same company, a different platoon, so he was pretty much with you this whole way.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.854
He wasn't with you obviously when you were hit, but he knew that you were hit.

18:28.894 --> 18:33.619
As a matter of fact, he was the one that wrote the letter back to Marie that said that you had been hit, but you were okay.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.421
Yeah, I think that's right.

18:36.122 --> 18:43.470
Yeah, I guess the interesting part about that is that my brother and I had come to A&M together.

18:43.737 --> 18:53.614
And then we had been inducted together and went into the service together and into the European theater together.

18:53.854 --> 18:54.075
Right.

18:54.155 --> 18:54.936
Yes.

18:54.956 --> 18:55.617
Right.

18:55.718 --> 18:56.359
That is unique.

18:56.539 --> 18:58.863
I want to go to some photographs now that you supplied us.

18:58.883 --> 19:03.030
These are photographs from your collection, from your home, and I want you to talk a little bit about them.

19:03.050 --> 19:05.374
We're going to go, I think, the first picture.

19:05.692 --> 19:08.696
is one that I found, I believe that's you right there.

19:08.877 --> 19:11.300
Is that when you were at Texas A&M?

19:11.320 --> 19:13.623
No, that's my high school photograph.

19:13.643 --> 19:15.085
Oh, that's your high school photograph, okay.

19:15.286 --> 19:18.050
That uniform's an ROTC uniform.

19:18.170 --> 19:18.490
Okay.

19:19.271 --> 19:21.114
So that was in El Paso?

19:21.134 --> 19:22.916
In El Paso, Austin High School.

19:22.937 --> 19:25.600
Austin High School in El Paso, in the ROTC?

19:25.620 --> 19:25.740
Yes.

19:26.061 --> 19:26.822
Okay.

19:27.106 --> 19:44.645
All right, now this is Texas A&M, and I've put a little arrow up there, a little amateur arrow there to show, couldn't get the entire company in that one picture because that's about half the company right there, but there you are standing in front of the very familiar building there at Texas A&M.

19:44.665 --> 19:47.848
At that time, they used to call us frogs.

19:47.868 --> 19:54.015
The first half of the year, we were frogs, not fish, I think.

19:54.035 --> 19:54.936
Not fish.

19:54.916 --> 19:57.178
So that's half a group of the frogs right there.

19:57.799 --> 20:05.987
And here we have, this is later on with your company when you're in the Army, and I've put a couple of arrows there.

20:06.007 --> 20:10.872
On the left arrow there, I believe is you, and that's your brother, the right arrow that I have pointed.

20:10.892 --> 20:12.694
That's correct, yeah.

20:12.714 --> 20:13.234
Right.

20:13.254 --> 20:17.459
Company K. Company K. Wow.

20:18.339 --> 20:19.120
Talk about this picture.

20:19.641 --> 20:24.145
Oh, I guess that's somewhere after the war's over.

20:24.385 --> 20:24.906
Right.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.813
occupational duty.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.997
Fine-looking soldier there, okay.

20:31.418 --> 20:32.339
He was young anyway.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.261
Very young anyway.

20:34.281 --> 20:37.445
Now this is on a shipping dock, is that right?

20:37.685 --> 20:39.487
Yes.

20:39.507 --> 20:39.767
Excuse me.

20:40.588 --> 20:49.358
That's coming back after the war and we had been in occupation for a while and little by little

20:49.642 --> 20:55.637
They were bringing all our folks back, and that's on the boat that I came back.

20:55.718 --> 20:57.382
It's a Liberty ship.

20:57.562 --> 20:58.886
I see.

20:59.527 --> 21:02.976
They were used extensively during World War II.

21:03.277 --> 21:04.438
Now talk about this picture.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.019
This is kind of a funny story here.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.922
You're an army man, but you're in that picture.

21:08.942 --> 21:11.524
And I think you're the one in the dark Navy uniform.

21:11.725 --> 21:12.846
Talk about how this came about.

21:12.866 --> 21:16.429
Well, now that's at Texas University.

21:18.230 --> 21:22.674
We were stationed at Camp Swift, which is close by really.

21:22.735 --> 21:32.203
And I had some friends that were in the Naval service in Texas University.

21:32.183 --> 21:42.414
Just like when we went to ASTP in Ohio State, one of these folks were in the Navy program at Texas University.

21:42.434 --> 21:47.879
And I had one of those sailors there that not known, really not.

21:48.760 --> 21:57.029
One of the people there at Texas University in the Navy got to be my brother-in-law mayor and my sister.

21:57.249 --> 22:00.773
But we traded them uniforms.

22:01.310 --> 22:27.655
give them our our army duds and we borrowed their their sailor duds and took this picture that was in uh 40 what 43 44 somewhere in there before going over before going over and you're the one in the dark sailor that is correct sailor uniform right there uh this is your uh shadow box as it were a picture of it with your awards obviously you see on the top right that's the purple heart

22:28.141 --> 22:31.533
that you received for being wounded in 1945.

22:32.979 --> 22:36.632
And I see the Bronze Star Medal on the top left,

22:37.456 --> 22:41.261
And obviously these are awards that you're very proud of as you're proud of your service.

22:42.423 --> 22:42.523
Yeah.

22:42.543 --> 22:42.783
Yes.

22:43.704 --> 22:46.668
Mostly the ones on below are service awards.

22:46.708 --> 22:48.250
Right, right.

22:48.270 --> 22:53.697
The patches, the one on the left is the Ozark division patch.

22:54.478 --> 22:58.584
And as you can see how it's almost spells out Ozark.

22:58.604 --> 22:59.565
Correct.

22:59.545 --> 23:07.436
The one in the middle patch is the ASTP program patch, Army Specialized Training Program.

23:08.377 --> 23:12.142
And then the third one is the Army patch.

23:12.963 --> 23:20.133
So that's about the... And then the service medals, the five service medals and the ribbons that go with those below?

23:20.153 --> 23:21.114
Yeah, they're on top.

23:22.616 --> 23:28.624
And the ornament there above the middle patch, the blue, sort of the aqua blue one,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.812
That's the 405th Infantry Division patch.

23:31.912 --> 23:32.253
Okay.

23:32.673 --> 23:35.578
And then right above it is the combat infantry badge.

23:35.658 --> 23:36.158
Right.

23:36.178 --> 23:36.819
Yes.

23:36.839 --> 23:37.961
Right.

23:37.981 --> 23:41.646
And then my dog tag right up above the army.

23:41.907 --> 23:42.167
Sure.

23:43.048 --> 23:43.469
Sure.

23:43.489 --> 23:43.890
Sure.

23:43.910 --> 23:45.692
I see that.

23:45.712 --> 23:47.214
I know that you're very proud of that.

23:48.156 --> 23:54.645
Like so many who served in the European theater when you left, after you had healed from your wounds when you left,

23:54.760 --> 24:02.794
It was your thought that you would be getting ready to go to Japan and fight the war there and what was gonna be a ground war in Japan.

24:02.854 --> 24:07.402
And of course, as history will tell us, that never happened with the dropping of the bomb.

24:07.422 --> 24:10.066
But that was the intent, obviously.

24:10.086 --> 24:14.153
That's what you thought when you came back to the United States, you were getting ready to go west.

24:14.133 --> 24:26.646
Well, before I came to the United States, because by the time I got to the United States, the war in the Pacific was over in August.

24:26.666 --> 24:39.600
So I was in occupational duty, but they were rigging to go from Europe direct to the Far East to complement the other

24:39.985 --> 24:42.067
people there, other forces there.

24:42.288 --> 24:55.663
Right, and one very important thing you did was to reunite with Marie, and you all were married, and you were married in El Paso, I believe, and then you all packed up and came to Texas A&M, is that right?

24:56.063 --> 24:56.704
Almost right.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.528
We were married in Columbus, Ohio.

25:00.548 --> 25:02.130
Columbus, Ohio, that's right, where she lived.

25:02.270 --> 25:05.674
Where she lived, that's our home territory.

25:05.774 --> 25:09.098
Right, married in Columbus, Ohio, and then brought her to Texas A&M.

25:09.078 --> 25:13.988
You told me a story right before we got started about your dad, and I just think that that is fascinating.

25:14.008 --> 25:22.304
Your dad is of French descent, and your mother is of Mexican descent, and he came over at Ellis Island.

25:22.324 --> 25:25.892
He was an immigrant from France, and that's how he got here.

25:26.172 --> 25:28.116
I know that's something that you're very, very proud of.

25:28.096 --> 25:28.617
Oh, yes.

25:30.019 --> 25:33.584
He came over by himself at 16 years of age.

25:34.325 --> 25:43.138
And he was already a, I don't know, what do you call it, full-fledged carpenter, carpet cabinet maker.

25:43.839 --> 25:46.342
And he did it on his own.

25:46.402 --> 25:53.192
He couldn't speak the English language when he landed, but he did, learned it.

25:53.172 --> 26:02.408
worked his way through and finally he migrated to El Paso where he met my mother.

26:02.569 --> 26:15.031
Now, another little story about him is that he volunteered for World War I and he went back to France in the U.S.

26:15.171 --> 26:15.872
Army.

26:15.987 --> 26:16.608
I'll be darned.

26:16.628 --> 26:19.571
So he fought in that war.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.395
We fought on this second war.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.136
And so.

26:23.156 --> 26:24.217
What a wonderful heritage.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.419
Jules, I know you're proud of that.

26:25.499 --> 26:27.121
We're proud of you and thank you for your service.

26:27.141 --> 26:28.242
But we are out of time.

26:28.262 --> 26:29.143
Thank you for being here.

26:29.163 --> 26:29.664
Thank you.

26:30.285 --> 26:34.610
Jules and Marie Jacquin's children know about World War II and their father's service.

26:34.630 --> 26:41.278
And we can only hope that the schools will continue to teach the lessons of the sacrifices of that greatest generation.

26:41.299 --> 26:45.724
We certainly remember and we salute Jules Jacquin and all veterans for their service.

26:45.704 --> 26:46.905
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:46.925 --> 27:15.458
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
