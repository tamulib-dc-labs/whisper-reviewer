00:17.581 --> 00:36.096
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.417 --> 00:37.699
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:38.253 --> 00:46.626
Richard Richardson of Bryan tells an impressive story of his short time in Europe during World War II, near the end of that campaign in 1945.

00:47.768 --> 00:53.558
And we will talk about that today and his training in AAA, anti-aircraft artillery.

00:53.578 --> 00:58.405
He was stationed at Camp Wallace in Galveston County when Pearl Harbor was attacked.

00:58.946 --> 01:03.113
He was even shipped out to California in case the Japanese attacked the mainland.

01:03.650 --> 01:09.197
He arrived in Europe too late to experience combat, but he served his country proudly.

01:09.217 --> 01:19.751
But what also impresses me about this man is that at the age of 95, when the weather's good, he'll go play golf twice a week, and he regularly shoots much better than his age.

01:19.771 --> 01:25.339
Please welcome former Army Tech Sergeant Richard Richardson to Veterans of the Valley.

01:25.359 --> 01:29.865
Mr. Richardson, it's a pleasure to know you, and it's a pleasure to tell your story.

01:30.946 --> 01:33.049
You were raised in Minnesota

01:33.400 --> 01:39.947
And you joined up very early at about the age of 15.

01:40.067 --> 01:43.050
Talk about your time in Minnesota, talking about that.

01:43.290 --> 01:47.074
Well, first of all, I want to thank you for having me here.

01:47.094 --> 01:48.175
I appreciate it very much.

01:48.475 --> 01:48.955
It's a pleasure.

01:49.336 --> 01:50.397
I appreciate it very much.

01:51.138 --> 01:59.226
Yeah, I joined the Minnesota National Guard when I was a freshman in high school at age 15.

01:59.246 --> 02:01.568
15.

02:02.915 --> 02:10.745
Our first sergeant didn't want me in the company.

02:10.766 --> 02:12.067
He says, you won't last.

02:12.087 --> 02:13.129
He says, you won't make it.

02:13.169 --> 02:14.410
He says, you're just a kid.

02:15.512 --> 02:22.621
Well, I was in the armory in the office, and I'd signed the papers, enlistment papers.

02:23.442 --> 02:26.847
And when he walked in, he says, who's this?

02:27.637 --> 02:34.687
And the other member who brought me in there, he said, well, he's our new recruit.

02:35.188 --> 02:35.749
Yes, sir.

02:35.769 --> 02:36.891
He said, get him out of here.

02:36.931 --> 02:37.972
He's just a damn kid.

02:38.032 --> 02:38.753
We don't want him.

02:40.897 --> 02:50.511
By that time, the executive officer walked in, and they were short of personnel, and they had to get their enlistment up or they'd miss their summer camp.

02:51.432 --> 02:57.441
And back during the Depression, if you missed that summer camp, you missed a lot of dollars because the average

02:57.910 --> 02:58.411
G.I.

02:58.491 --> 03:00.594
made $30 in two weeks.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.040
And that's a lot more money than they made sometimes all summer long.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.221
Exactly.

03:06.241 --> 03:18.158
And so the first sergeant, the executive officer said, get him signed up.

03:18.739 --> 03:21.683
And he turned to the friend that brought me in there.

03:21.703 --> 03:27.090
He said, now take him downstairs to the supply sergeant and get him a uniform, get him a rifle.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.404
get him up on the floor ready to drill at 8 o'clock.

03:32.665 --> 03:36.449
So I become a boy soldier at age 15.

03:36.489 --> 03:37.430
I'll be darned.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.492
15, that's amazing.

03:39.933 --> 03:46.379
You left Minnesota after high school and you went to Chicago because the jobs were more plentiful there.

03:46.399 --> 03:47.740
That's the only place I could find a job.

03:47.801 --> 03:48.761
You could find a job.

03:49.222 --> 03:52.285
But you were drafted in March of 1941.

03:52.822 --> 03:54.865
March 15th.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.087
March 15th, 1941.

03:56.667 --> 04:05.920
And you took your first trip to Texas, to Camp Wallace, Texas, which at the time was actually an anti-aircraft training facility at the time.

04:06.020 --> 04:10.406
It was sort of a boot camp for anti-aircraft artillery training.

04:10.426 --> 04:10.707
Yes, sir.

04:11.167 --> 04:17.496
The American Army, up to that time, never had any anti-aircraft troops.

04:20.024 --> 04:49.002
train and design and equipped to fight aircraft they just didn't have them yes sir they didn't think anybody would ever invade this country with aircraft they didn't need them you know what i mean right that was their thinking what do we need with anti-aircraft troops nobody's going to fly over here from europe you know right or japan right you know not thinking that when the army moved to europe that's when they needed the anti-aircraft troops right

04:49.252 --> 04:51.674
And the Germans had an Air Force.

04:51.694 --> 04:59.020
You were drafted into the regular Army, and it was where you were at Camp Wallace, December 7, 1941.

05:00.501 --> 05:04.365
What do you remember about that Sunday and hearing about the attack on Pearl Harbor?

05:06.106 --> 05:14.333
Well, I was on the end for, I think, a year.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.454
Right.

05:15.474 --> 05:16.555
But that was on the Sunday.

05:16.655 --> 05:19.157
Monday morning, they put a notice on the bulletin board

05:19.340 --> 05:24.185
that all one-year draftees were in for the duration.

05:25.026 --> 05:26.508
Forget about going home.

05:26.528 --> 05:29.591
Right, because you were 10 months into your one-year hitch.

05:29.811 --> 05:30.993
Yeah, I only had two months left.

05:31.133 --> 05:34.657
When Pearl Harbor was attacked, so everything changed then, right?

05:35.297 --> 05:36.158
Everything changed.

05:36.359 --> 05:37.119
Everything changed.

05:40.203 --> 05:43.086
They relegated me to...

05:43.927 --> 05:50.298
a training cadre at Camp Wallace training new recruits coming in.

05:50.438 --> 05:58.733
I got promoted to a sergeant and I spent I think about 15 months there training new recruits coming in.

05:59.033 --> 05:59.334
Right.

05:59.615 --> 06:02.459
Which was got to be sort of a monotonous job.

06:03.622 --> 06:04.483
Because your plan

06:04.868 --> 06:16.023
Had America not entered the war with Pearl Harbor, your plan was to get out, go to California, get a job where they were manufacturing planes going to Europe, right?

06:16.043 --> 06:16.403
Yeah, right.

06:16.423 --> 06:19.508
They said they needed people out there to manufacture planes.

06:19.948 --> 06:23.513
They couldn't build them fast enough for the English and the French.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.335
They wanted all the planes they could get a hold of.

06:25.676 --> 06:25.976
Right.

06:28.399 --> 06:31.804
Talk about the time before you went overseas, though, and what you did.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.147
You did some training, I believe, in North Carolina.

06:34.167 --> 06:34.808
Is that right?

06:38.686 --> 06:40.148
Yeah, I was trained.

06:41.009 --> 06:48.299
I was stationed at the camp in North Carolina up up north of Wilmington.

06:48.419 --> 06:48.620
Right.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.461
Camp Davis.

06:49.481 --> 06:50.142
Camp Davis.

06:50.182 --> 06:51.023
Yes, sir.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.385
Well, I spent two years there.

06:52.645 --> 06:52.905
Right.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.510
I spent two years there.

06:58.313 --> 06:59.935
Training, teaching.

07:00.657 --> 07:07.244
anti-aircraft tactics to officers coming in from civilian life.

07:07.404 --> 07:08.045
Right.

07:08.065 --> 07:09.947
50 caliber machine gun training.

07:09.987 --> 07:10.968
Yeah, 50 caliber machine gun.

07:12.430 --> 07:15.273
We had the 40 millimeter, we had the 37 millimeter.

07:17.616 --> 07:19.398
But your specialty was 40 millimeter.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.460
My specialty was 40 millimeter, right.

07:21.640 --> 07:21.880
Right.

07:21.900 --> 07:28.147
We're going to have a picture later on of a sample of a 40 millimeter gun that was your specialty.

07:28.988 --> 07:30.630
They sent you to school for that.

07:30.998 --> 07:52.129
uh the 40 millimeter talk about that it was obviously the best weapon for low-flying aircraft because the japanese didn't have any bombers and the germans didn't have many so that was the importance of that weapon right yeah most of the aircraft we were they come up against us for low-flying aircraft yes sir and and the 40 millimeter

07:53.105 --> 07:55.047
was an automatic weapon.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.028
It was a good weapon.

07:58.371 --> 08:02.756
Clip fed seven shots, seven rounds at a time.

08:03.316 --> 08:08.903
You could get off a lot of, you could use a lot of ammunition in a hurry.

08:09.343 --> 08:14.909
Talk about being sent to California, because at the time after Pearl Harbor, we didn't know.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.613
We didn't know whether the Japanese was going to attack the mainland or not.

08:19.775 --> 08:21.036
Back then the army,

08:22.028 --> 08:46.028
hadn't faced situations like this and they would jump at conclusions you know we better get some troops out here and get them out here fast because the Japs could bypass Pearl Harbor and come right on in so they had this load of 40 millimeters on flat cars and we had to sleep on those flat cars with those guns

08:46.885 --> 08:48.747
all the way out to California at night.

08:49.127 --> 08:49.408
Right.

08:49.508 --> 08:51.490
Like there's a wintertime like the frozen bed.

08:51.870 --> 08:52.110
Yes.

08:52.571 --> 08:59.778
So and we took them out there and we set them up on high rise buildings that could support them.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.321
That was a lot of work.

09:02.621 --> 09:02.962
Yes, sir.

09:04.243 --> 09:11.250
But we no more got them up there and got, of course, we lived in the hotels, which was fine.

09:11.951 --> 09:15.795
But a week or 10 days, they said, well,

09:16.653 --> 09:22.080
We don't think we need those guns up there to take them back down and take them back to Camp Wallace.

09:22.100 --> 09:22.360
Right.

09:23.161 --> 09:25.264
Never saw a Japanese plane, fortunately.

09:25.324 --> 09:26.485
Never saw a Japanese plane, no.

09:26.886 --> 09:30.070
Japanese plane never got beyond Pearl Harbor.

09:30.971 --> 09:44.888
So you came back to Camp Wallace, and then in 1945, this was after you had gone to Camp Davis to do a couple of years of training others that we already talked about,

09:45.391 --> 09:48.836
You were transferred to the 303rd Ordnance Company.

09:49.478 --> 09:56.990
Talk a little bit about that and what the Ordnance Company exactly was and what its duty was.

09:57.931 --> 10:03.239
It pretty much had to do with weapons and ammunition and combat vehicles and things like that, right?

10:03.260 --> 10:10.110
Yeah, I... Let's see, let me think.

10:10.130 --> 10:11.112
I was at camp...

10:15.260 --> 10:40.963
down by brownwood i can't think of the name of the camp camp buoy i think it was okay and uh i was sort of in limbo i mean they didn't know what to do with me right i was an anti-aircraft artillery specialist but uh they or this outfit was getting ready to move overseas

10:41.348 --> 10:51.747
So they pulled me out one day and gave me traveling orders and shipped me up to Fort Leonard Wood Missouri.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.430
Yes, sir.

10:53.450 --> 10:57.197
Where I joined the 303rd Ordnance Company.

10:57.457 --> 10:57.838
Yes, sir.

10:59.033 --> 11:03.097
And they were getting ready to go overseas.

11:03.117 --> 11:16.652
But before they went overseas, they shipped us down to Brownwood, Camp Boogie in Brownwood for about four or five months to get ready to go overseas.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.496
Now, I want you to tell the viewers about your trip overseas.

11:22.037 --> 11:23.539
You tended to get seasick.

11:24.582 --> 11:30.828
And there's a rather funny story about when you got seasick going over and getting stranded on the boat.

11:31.548 --> 11:32.089
Tell us that story.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.152
I got seasick before I ever left New York Harbor.

11:36.673 --> 11:37.634
I just couldn't stand.

11:38.295 --> 11:39.075
Just thinking about it.

11:39.195 --> 11:40.276
Thinking about it.

11:40.296 --> 11:44.160
Well, being down in the hole of a ship with a thing going this way and that way.

11:44.420 --> 11:44.660
Right.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.262
It just threw me for a roof.

11:46.302 --> 11:46.662
I couldn't.

11:46.742 --> 11:47.783
I didn't eat.

11:47.803 --> 11:48.003
Right.

11:48.284 --> 11:49.285
For two solid weeks.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.007
My buddies would bring me fruit.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.793
And you were on a zigzag course, too, right?

11:54.933 --> 11:57.397
And we were zigzagging and.

12:00.862 --> 12:05.288
But that sent me up to the infirmary when we were about halfway across.

12:06.690 --> 12:07.812
And they gave me a shot.

12:08.353 --> 12:08.573
Uh huh.

12:09.615 --> 12:11.758
And I said, we're going to take you out on deck.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.782
Uh huh.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.543
Well, you can.

12:16.084 --> 12:17.105
It was a nice day.

12:17.145 --> 12:21.792
It was sunshine where you could relate the movement of the ship to the waves of the ocean.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.231
I said, well, fine.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.996
And they gave me a box of these saltine crackers to eat.

12:28.016 --> 12:28.636
Right.

12:28.656 --> 12:29.477
To calm your stomach.

12:29.777 --> 12:31.099
Yeah.

12:31.119 --> 12:32.020
I ate those crackers.

12:32.080 --> 12:32.720
I sat out there.

12:32.740 --> 12:40.989
But what they did was, now, there's not supposed to be any troops out on deck, so we're going to have to tie it to this rigging.

12:41.049 --> 12:44.853
So they took a big belt and put it around me and tied it to this rigging.

12:45.653 --> 12:46.815
And I couldn't reach the buckle.

12:46.875 --> 12:47.615
I couldn't get loose.

12:48.216 --> 12:48.997
You were out on the deck.

12:49.337 --> 12:50.158
Out on the deck.

12:50.898 --> 12:53.622
And I sat there all afternoon and I ate those crackers.

12:54.643 --> 13:05.377
And along about the time the sun was going down, almost down, I noticed these destroyers would come up real close and people would get out there and they're looking at me.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.982
What are they looking at me for?

13:09.642 --> 13:11.044
Well, I wasn't supposed to be out there.

13:12.586 --> 13:19.335
So pretty soon an officer come by and he said,

13:20.902 --> 13:27.451
I could see that they had communication between these ships and the convoy and the ship I was on.

13:29.274 --> 13:32.018
He come up to me and he says, soldier, what are you doing out here?

13:32.038 --> 13:40.170
I says, well, they brought me out here from the infirmary because I was seasick for a long time and wanted to get my stomach straightened down.

13:41.452 --> 13:45.137
But I said, the man had brought...

13:45.117 --> 13:49.362
that brought me out here said he would come back and get me.

13:49.502 --> 13:50.763
He didn't come back.

13:50.783 --> 13:51.744
He went off duty.

13:51.844 --> 13:54.687
He forgot about me, but I was strapped to this rigging.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.628
I couldn't get loose.

13:56.850 --> 13:57.931
I just sat out there.

13:57.951 --> 14:01.154
He shook his head.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.796
God, I've never seen anything like this.

14:04.898 --> 14:06.340
I'll bet he hadn't.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.784
You told me another story about sort of sneaking in to take a hot shower.

14:10.945 --> 14:14.128
You were a non-com, but they told you how to

14:14.682 --> 14:19.249
how to get to the officers' quarters to take a shower, right?

14:19.349 --> 14:26.519
Yeah, our executive officer, he said, when you want a shower, he said, just put your raincoat on with no insignia on it, no rain.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.262
He said, go up the steps.

14:29.463 --> 14:32.868
On the left is the cold water showers for the enlisted people.

14:32.948 --> 14:35.472
On the right is hot water showers for the officers.

14:35.492 --> 14:38.376
He said, go in there as an officer and take a shower.

14:39.258 --> 14:40.499
Just wear a raincoat.

14:40.539 --> 14:41.541
They won't know the difference.

14:41.561 --> 14:42.042
And they didn't.

14:42.122 --> 14:44.385
That's where I went to get my showers.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.143
You arrived in Europe in the winter of 1945.

14:48.203 --> 14:54.712
This was after the Battle of the Bulge when the war was winding down.

14:54.892 --> 15:00.019
You landed in France, went across Belgium, France, Belgium, and into Germany.

15:00.820 --> 15:05.226
Talk about what you remember about your service there, about your months there.

15:05.266 --> 15:09.451
There was not a lot of combat, but you did cross the Rhine River.

15:09.471 --> 15:11.554
Talk about what you recall about the service there.

15:13.559 --> 15:14.360
Yeah, we moved.

15:15.261 --> 15:19.688
We had to get on when we got off the troop ship.

15:20.449 --> 15:23.673
We went to a holding area because they had to unload our equipment.

15:24.234 --> 15:25.616
That took a week or 10 days.

15:25.997 --> 15:26.117
Right.

15:26.137 --> 15:33.027
Well, we got our equipment and we started moving up through across France and Belgium and to Germany.

15:34.409 --> 15:35.710
We crossed the Rhine River.

15:36.792 --> 15:39.095
I crossed the Rhine River on a little old footbridge.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.678
Right.

15:40.698 --> 15:43.161
And then moved on up into Germany.

15:43.411 --> 15:55.706
into a little town that was built around a square, but maybe it was 15, 20,000 people, but they were the nicest people.

15:56.627 --> 16:02.174
We moved them out of their homes to get the houses that we need to sleep in.

16:03.075 --> 16:04.977
But they didn't resent us.

16:04.997 --> 16:05.738
We'd come back.

16:06.038 --> 16:10.684
They had gardens out behind their home because they didn't have much food.

16:11.575 --> 16:13.558
But I was a section leader.

16:13.799 --> 16:14.900
I had 18 men.

16:16.383 --> 16:22.893
And the first thing that some of my men wanted to do was went out into their strawberry fields and started eating their strawberries.

16:22.913 --> 16:28.842
I got them out of there and I laid the law down that I didn't want to see an American out there in those gardens.

16:29.203 --> 16:29.664
Yes, sir.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.829
I said, that's all those German women have is what's in those gardens.

16:32.929 --> 16:33.409
Yes, sir.

16:33.429 --> 16:34.591
They need that food.

16:34.611 --> 16:34.892
Right.

16:35.953 --> 16:36.334
And...

16:36.533 --> 16:38.716
That was a wonderful relationship you had.

16:39.176 --> 16:43.361
They were considered the enemy but they were nice people.

16:43.401 --> 16:45.244
They were real nice people.

16:45.284 --> 16:49.969
What they wanted was one of the things they really wanted was soap.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.894
You couldn't buy a bar of soap in Europe after the war.

16:55.636 --> 17:06.169
The army had these big bars of lye soap and I'd go to the supply sergeant and get four or five at a time and those German women would come over to the

17:07.313 --> 17:14.369
The house where I was living, their house really, and you want your clothes washed?

17:14.409 --> 17:16.374
I said, yeah, we need some soap.

17:16.394 --> 17:18.238
Well, I'd give them a whole big bar of soap.

17:18.919 --> 17:19.862
They wouldn't use much of it.

17:19.882 --> 17:25.795
They'd take the rest home because you couldn't beg and borrow or steal a bar of soap in Europe after the war.

17:26.551 --> 17:31.657
You know, what's kind of ironic is that after you got out, you spent 45 years selling soap, didn't you?

17:31.677 --> 17:35.301
For Purex, right?

17:37.664 --> 17:40.367
We'll talk about that in a little bit also.

17:45.052 --> 17:49.297
What do you remember about where you were on VE Day?

17:49.317 --> 17:50.238
That was May the 8th.

17:50.818 --> 17:52.460
May the 7th, the Germans surrendered.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.942
VE Day was May the 8th.

17:54.395 --> 17:59.280
What do you remember about where you were and sort of what, how you got the word and the celebration of that?

18:00.741 --> 18:07.448
Yeah, we'd moved up across the Rhine and set up camp in this little town.

18:07.468 --> 18:08.389
It was a nice town.

18:08.429 --> 18:11.212
It was a friendly town.

18:11.232 --> 18:20.501
But we got, you always have people in your unit that goes overboard on things.

18:21.262 --> 18:22.343
These two guys had a,

18:23.993 --> 18:27.757
had found a wine cellar.

18:28.778 --> 18:31.060
It had a two and a half ton truck.

18:31.080 --> 18:36.345
And they loaded that two and a half ton truck down with all the wine they could find.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.847
And they had just gobs of it.

18:38.867 --> 18:50.558
So when they announced the end of the war, they brought this truck into our compound and parked it and said, boys, come and get it.

18:52.073 --> 18:56.079
And the G.I.s just went, wow, I drank a little bit too much myself.

18:56.099 --> 19:01.507
But they went out there and get three, four bottles of wine, went on and it shouldn't be one, you know.

19:01.527 --> 19:04.291
And they got sick and they had a mess on their hands.

19:05.192 --> 19:12.242
Finally, the inspector general come by a couple of days afterwards and he ate

19:12.728 --> 19:19.175
the butt out of our commanding officer for letting the things get out of hand.

19:19.335 --> 19:19.876
I bet he did.

19:20.717 --> 19:23.460
We've got some pictures here that I want to go to and look at.

19:24.261 --> 19:27.264
Just a few pictures here that you supplied us.

19:27.284 --> 19:33.251
This is a picture of a young army soldier, Richard Richardson.

19:33.271 --> 19:36.154
You believe that that was taken after your service, right?

19:37.855 --> 19:38.797
You were young.

19:39.077 --> 19:42.204
I think that was taken after I come back from overseas.

19:42.304 --> 19:43.606
From overseas, yeah.

19:44.388 --> 19:46.612
You've got your tech sergeant stripes on there.

19:46.632 --> 19:57.113
Now we're going to go way back when you were young, 16, 17 years old, and this is what you were talking about in Minnesota and the rifle company in Minnesota, right?

19:58.038 --> 19:59.059
That's the National Guard.

19:59.079 --> 20:00.801
National Guard, rifle company, right?

20:01.001 --> 20:02.022
Yeah, it's a rifle company.

20:02.222 --> 20:02.442
Right.

20:02.583 --> 20:08.028
I want to mention, you are top row, second from the right as we're looking at the picture.

20:08.068 --> 20:09.469
That's you.

20:09.489 --> 20:10.150
Yeah.

20:10.170 --> 20:16.597
Yeah, I am not bragging, but I was a good shot with a rifle.

20:16.617 --> 20:17.137
That's okay.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.499
I made the state rifle team.

20:19.520 --> 20:19.840
Yes, sir.

20:20.220 --> 20:28.028
And we went to, every year we went, the state would send a rifle team

20:29.003 --> 20:33.010
to Camp Perry, Ohio to the National Rifle Matches.

20:33.030 --> 20:33.190
Right.

20:33.391 --> 20:35.374
They used to have National Rifle Matches there.

20:35.655 --> 20:35.975
Right.

20:35.995 --> 20:36.656
Before the war.

20:36.857 --> 20:37.157
Yes, sir.

20:37.438 --> 20:38.440
So I made a trip.

20:40.123 --> 20:43.509
That's the Minnesota team right there.

20:44.150 --> 20:44.570
Yes, sir.

20:45.492 --> 20:46.233
That's a great picture.

20:46.474 --> 20:48.778
That's hanging on your wall in your bedroom, as a matter of fact.

20:49.319 --> 20:52.885
This is a photograph that I found of a 40 millimeter

20:53.287 --> 21:01.974
very similar to the one that was your specialty, just so people can get an idea of what the 40 millimeter looked like.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.438
Yeah, it was a good gun.

21:06.458 --> 21:06.558
Yeah.

21:06.578 --> 21:07.399
It was a real good gun.

21:07.419 --> 21:08.140
It was automatic.

21:08.840 --> 21:09.100
Right.

21:09.981 --> 21:11.563
That man had the clip of shells.

21:11.923 --> 21:12.243
Yes, sir.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.825
You could feed them with a clip.

21:14.845 --> 21:15.426
Right.

21:15.446 --> 21:21.991
And the only thing you just had to be careful of was not to push them down in there too fast and they'd jam up, you know.

21:22.152 --> 21:22.652
Yes, sir.

21:23.088 --> 21:24.310
Yes, sir.

21:24.330 --> 21:29.097
But you were an expert with that weapon that played havoc on low-lying aircraft.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.819
I spent a lot of time with that weapon.

21:30.879 --> 21:33.323
I was an instructor on it for almost two years.

21:33.483 --> 21:33.863
Yes, sir.

21:34.384 --> 21:36.948
Yes, sir.

21:36.968 --> 21:48.845
Here's a photograph that hangs on your wall of a shadow box of your memorabilia from the war, a picture in the middle, your tech sergeant stripes, some of your participation medals from the war.

21:49.606 --> 21:51.829
I see your dog tags there in the bottom right.

21:53.108 --> 21:58.194
And I guess those are your unit insignias up there at the top, I guess, right?

21:59.876 --> 22:01.417
Yeah, that was the... Right.

22:03.319 --> 22:09.546
That was the Antioch after I told you I was the second army insignia in the center on top.

22:09.566 --> 22:14.592
And the little plaque under your picture talks about being the 303rd Ordnance Company.

22:14.612 --> 22:14.712
Yeah.

22:14.732 --> 22:16.915
So I know that that's very special to you.

22:16.975 --> 22:19.357
I know one of your sons made that up for you.

22:20.318 --> 22:22.761
And then finally, a picture of you and your wife, Betty.

22:23.652 --> 22:47.668
uh taken several years ago you lost your wife betty several years ago i know and uh but uh you and betty actually got married before you went overseas isn't that right oh yeah yeah we married when i was in the army right uh we were married in let's see in the 12th of april uh 40

22:49.859 --> 22:50.580
Two.

22:50.600 --> 22:50.940
Okay.

22:52.041 --> 22:56.185
Remembering the 12th of April is more important than the year to wives, so that's good.

22:56.225 --> 22:59.128
1942.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.631
That's a wonderful picture.

23:01.991 --> 23:08.958
And I know that Betty went with you down to Texas when you were at Fort Wallace and you eventually came back to Texas.

23:09.439 --> 23:19.309
Before we leave your service though, you were offered a commission to become a second lieutenant, but you turned it down and I want you to tell them why.

23:20.369 --> 23:25.195
Yeah, well, this colonel, he was a good guy.

23:25.216 --> 23:38.253
He come to me one time and he says, Sergeant, he says, every, and really, every GI, any army wanted to go to OCS to become an officer.

23:38.473 --> 23:38.754
Yes.

23:38.774 --> 23:40.576
That was their, that was their thing.

23:40.596 --> 23:42.118
They just wanted to become an officer.

23:43.059 --> 23:43.180
Right.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.444
So this colonel pinned me down one day and he says,

23:47.875 --> 23:49.257
Why didn't you go to OCS?

23:49.317 --> 23:50.880
I said, why should I go to OCS?

23:51.300 --> 23:53.444
He said, don't you want to be an officer?

23:53.464 --> 23:55.527
I said, well, why should I want to be an officer?

23:57.029 --> 23:59.774
I said, what does the second lieutenant make?

23:59.874 --> 24:01.757
He says, $125 a month.

24:03.159 --> 24:08.187
Well, as a tech sergeant, I made $121 a month.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.352
An officer had to buy his uniform.

24:11.922 --> 24:13.024
He had to pay.

24:13.044 --> 24:17.331
If the rational allowance was 50 cents a day, he had to pay 50 cents a day for his food.

24:17.652 --> 24:18.493
Right.

24:18.514 --> 24:20.818
He had to buy his uniforms.

24:20.838 --> 24:22.921
I said, I get my food for free.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.504
I get my uniforms for free.

24:26.207 --> 24:31.556
And I get my pay is two or three dollars less than an officer.

24:31.616 --> 24:33.139
Why should I want to be an officer?

24:33.700 --> 24:34.842
Makes sense to me.

24:35.598 --> 24:37.401
He says, well, you got a good point there.

24:37.621 --> 24:43.790
But he said, a lot of people just want to be an officer for the glory of it.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.314
I said, well, I'm not looking for any glory.

24:46.434 --> 24:51.341
I'm not going to make a career out of the army when the war is over.

24:51.401 --> 24:52.142
I'm going to get out.

24:52.483 --> 24:53.444
Yeah.

24:53.464 --> 24:53.965
And that's it.

24:54.266 --> 24:55.327
Yeah.

24:55.347 --> 24:56.248
Now, very important point.

24:56.289 --> 25:03.199
When when the war was over in Europe, you got on a boat, you thought you were going home, but you didn't.

25:03.219 --> 25:04.761
You were headed to the Philippines.

25:05.062 --> 25:09.769
And it wasn't until you all got to Panama that you got the word.

25:10.269 --> 25:10.930
Talk about that.

25:12.953 --> 25:24.049
Yeah, they pulled us out of Germany on the 4th of July down to Marseille, France, into a staging area.

25:25.130 --> 25:28.055
We had to turn in our equipment.

25:28.075 --> 25:30.478
And so I told the men in my section, I said, well,

25:31.201 --> 25:32.563
We got to turn in our equipment.

25:32.583 --> 25:34.025
We're going into a staging area.

25:34.085 --> 25:35.507
That means we're going to get on a ship.

25:36.167 --> 25:42.175
If we're going to get on a ship, I think we're going home.

25:42.195 --> 25:44.538
So we were there about two weeks.

25:46.320 --> 25:56.213
They finally loaded us into gondola cars on a train and took us down to the dock and put us on this boat.

25:57.982 --> 26:03.748
And the first thing I did was ask one of the members of the crew on the boat, where are we going?

26:03.928 --> 26:05.330
They just look at you and shake their head.

26:06.571 --> 26:07.312
I knew what was up.

26:07.492 --> 26:10.094
They weren't allowed to say where they were going.

26:11.656 --> 26:22.487
So we got, we were at sea, got out of the, what's the name of that big sea?

26:25.336 --> 26:26.838
The Red Sea, yes?

26:27.078 --> 26:30.303
No, not the Red Sea, but... Right.

26:30.323 --> 26:30.503
Uh-huh.

26:30.824 --> 26:31.845
I can't think of it.

26:31.865 --> 26:34.349
You're asking me geography questions, and I'm going to be back.

26:34.409 --> 26:35.871
Between Africa and the U.S.

26:35.891 --> 26:36.391
Right.

26:36.411 --> 26:37.092
Okay.

26:37.112 --> 26:37.393
Right.

26:39.075 --> 26:50.892
So I just sat back and moved my bedroll and everything out on deck, and I slept on deck, and we were going across the South Atlantic.

26:50.932 --> 26:53.896
It was pretty warm.

26:53.916 --> 26:54.837
But...

26:56.048 --> 27:00.312
We were pulled up outside of Panama Canal.

27:01.013 --> 27:01.293
Right.

27:03.716 --> 27:08.020
And I was sleeping out on deck and we had a five inch AA gun up there.

27:09.141 --> 27:13.426
And all of a sudden, these guys started firing that five inch AA gun.

27:13.586 --> 27:15.208
I wasn't 40, 50 feet away.

27:15.228 --> 27:18.371
It almost rolled me out of my bedroll.

27:18.391 --> 27:21.574
I went over there and I said, what are you guys shooting at?

27:21.594 --> 27:23.076
There's no jet planes around here.

27:23.696 --> 27:25.178
We're not shooting at jet planes.

27:26.221 --> 27:27.482
Had you heard?

27:27.542 --> 27:30.145
He said, Japan is surrendered.

27:30.165 --> 27:31.186
The war is over with.

27:32.427 --> 27:33.488
And that was a celebration.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.270
And that was a celebration.

27:35.310 --> 27:42.317
About 15, 20 minutes later, the captain got on the intercom and announced it.

27:42.337 --> 27:43.358
He said, now hear this.

27:43.418 --> 27:44.039
Now hear this.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.683
Japan is surrendered.

27:47.863 --> 27:48.704
The war is over.

27:48.984 --> 27:54.169
And I've just received orders to weigh anchor and proceed to the port of New York for debarkation.

27:54.689 --> 27:56.611
Mr. Richardson, we're just about out of time.

27:56.631 --> 28:00.434
I wanted to talk about other things, but so you did go back to New York.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.096
You were discharged in November of 1945.

28:03.376 --> 28:07.880
You worked for the Purex company for some 45 years.

28:08.881 --> 28:10.963
You and Betty had three children.

28:11.163 --> 28:15.427
Your son, Larry, your oldest, you all lost to cancer a few years ago.

28:15.507 --> 28:21.172
Kirk works here at Texas A&M as a firefighter instructor, and Andy lives in Houston.

28:21.192 --> 28:23.734
Those are your three sons, and you have grandchildren.

28:23.714 --> 28:26.777
And I want to thank you for your service, but we're out of time.

28:26.797 --> 28:29.400
I wish we could talk more, but thank you very much for your service.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.243
Well, thank you for having me.

28:32.263 --> 28:32.904
I appreciate it.

28:33.044 --> 28:33.444
Thank you.

28:34.085 --> 28:38.109
Richard Richardson trained to shoot down enemy planes, but fortunately never had to.

28:38.570 --> 28:45.037
Like so many who entered the service in 1941, his was nonetheless a proud Army career of readiness.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.441
We salute him for his military service and his civilian work.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.585
And at age 95, regularly breaking 90 on the golf course.

28:52.645 --> 28:53.586
Now that's impressive.

28:53.988 --> 28:55.070
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:55.391 --> 29:11.203
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
