00:27.520 --> 00:29.217
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.510
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.300 --> 00:36.886
It would be hard to find anyone who knows more about the Brazos Valley than General Joe Hanover.

00:36.906 --> 00:58.168
He moved to Wheelock with his family in 1925 when he was just seven years old, and except for the five years he served his country during World War II, has called the Brazos Valley home practically his whole life, including the 25 post-war years with the 420th Engineering Brigade on Carson Street in Bryan, his final assignment being its commander.

00:58.621 --> 01:00.183
Texas A&M class of 1940.

01:00.904 --> 01:04.308
Please welcome General Joe G. Hanover to Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.310
It's an honor to have you here, General Hanover.

01:06.690 --> 01:07.091
Thank you.

01:07.111 --> 01:17.163
1936, you started at Texas A&M, and you actually commuted from Wheelock to Texas A&M, and you did that with an old, old car that your granddad had given you, right?

01:17.263 --> 01:18.885
Tell us about that.

01:18.905 --> 01:26.894
Well, he had an old 28 or 29 Chevrolet that he told me he could spare.

01:27.515 --> 01:27.615
Yeah.

01:28.068 --> 01:38.157
If I could keep it running and keep enough people to ride with me, either work A&M or students, to help me with the expenses, then he'd let me use it.

01:38.397 --> 01:39.018
Right.

01:39.038 --> 01:42.861
Well, I wasn't able to stay in a dormitory back in those days.

01:43.742 --> 01:50.068
So I got that old thing going, and I always had a load.

01:50.448 --> 01:50.728
Right.

01:51.349 --> 01:58.075
And so that's part of the way that my expenses played to go A&M.

01:58.595 --> 02:03.800
One of the people that you brought back and forth, I believe you told me, was a young lady named Lucille Scasta, right?

02:04.000 --> 02:04.421
That's right.

02:04.441 --> 02:05.141
Who you later married.

02:05.361 --> 02:05.702
That's right.

02:05.722 --> 02:07.844
And were married for 63 years.

02:08.184 --> 02:10.607
Funny thing, she didn't pay any rent.

02:10.947 --> 02:11.828
She didn't pay any rent.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.589
She rode for free, did she?

02:13.609 --> 02:14.250
How about that?

02:15.011 --> 02:20.876
Class of 1940, that means that you got to, when you had time to watch a little football, you saw the national championship team in 1939.

02:20.956 --> 02:21.157
Did.

02:21.217 --> 02:21.417
Did.

02:22.858 --> 02:23.439
Yeah.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.181
That was wonderful.

02:25.941 --> 02:26.762
Football was

02:27.130 --> 02:29.813
King at that time on the campus, of course.

02:29.833 --> 02:30.774
Indeed, indeed.

02:31.135 --> 02:33.097
As it still is, maybe someday we'll have another one.

02:33.117 --> 02:33.577
Who knows?

02:33.978 --> 02:42.708
And then I also saw the 1940 team that never lost a game until the Thanksgiving game.

02:43.749 --> 02:47.593
Had we won that game, I understand we would have gone to the Rose Bowl.

02:47.693 --> 02:48.574
Right, right.

02:48.774 --> 02:52.058
Only chance, I guess, to ever go to the Rose Bowl.

02:52.713 --> 02:58.079
You graduated in 1940 with a degree in civil engineering and went to work in Hearn for the highway department.

02:58.099 --> 03:02.323
But then in February of 41, you got your orders and you were in the military.

03:02.363 --> 03:03.444
Sort of take us from there.

03:03.885 --> 03:04.846
And what happened after that?

03:05.506 --> 03:09.771
Well, I got my orders in February of 1940, 41.

03:10.511 --> 03:10.732
Right.

03:10.952 --> 03:20.762
And it said the report to the 54th Coast Artillery in parentheses, COL.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.916
I had no idea what that meant.

03:24.738 --> 03:32.549
I had to report to Fort Crockett in Galveston and got down there and that meant it was a colored unit.

03:33.791 --> 03:40.000
The enlisted men and the NCOs were colored and the officers were white.

03:40.621 --> 03:54.723
We gathered at Fort Crockett to sort of get organized and there was a camp being built about eight or 10 miles out of Galveston called Camp Wallace.

03:56.125 --> 04:01.433
And when that got adequate enough for our troops to move in, we moved out there.

04:02.094 --> 04:07.422
Had no streets and it was mud and sort of

04:07.975 --> 04:25.051
low area but we moved in there and that's where our troops began to assemble and came to us and we would issue their equipment and it was a six inch gun outfit called Coast Artillery.

04:25.072 --> 04:32.899
The mission of the Coast Artillery is the same name implies was to guard the coast of America.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.100
Right.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.003
And we got our guns and

04:37.574 --> 04:43.732
They were old World War I guns, had rubber tires, solid rubber tires, and were pulled by a tractor.

04:45.177 --> 04:49.710
It was called a mobile unit.

04:50.939 --> 04:57.012
Not very mobile with that sort of a towing equipment, but it was termed mobile.

04:57.553 --> 04:58.394
Right.

04:58.415 --> 05:10.039
And we stayed there for until, I guess, during the summer of 42, summer of 41.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.682
41.

05:12.337 --> 05:16.047
And we were moved to North Carolina.

05:16.067 --> 05:16.649
Camp Davis.

05:16.909 --> 05:17.672
Camp Davis.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.620
They built a camp about 30 miles out of Wilmington.

05:21.883 --> 05:26.295
And our mission there would have been to set up on the coast

05:26.765 --> 05:31.569
There was a lot of submarine activity on the East Coast.

05:31.589 --> 05:35.833
And that was to be our mission temporarily, it turned out to be.

05:35.853 --> 05:37.454
To check and see what those subs were doing.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.535
Keep an eye on them.

05:39.236 --> 05:43.319
Now, you were at Camp Davis on December the 7th when Pearl Harbor was attacked.

05:43.339 --> 05:43.459
I was.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.843
What do you recall about that Sunday and what you were doing and how you heard about it?

05:48.504 --> 05:55.810
Well, we thought we were going to get two weeks of Christmas vacation.

05:56.482 --> 06:04.073
And my wife had gone home and I was going to join her back in Wheatlock for Christmas.

06:05.235 --> 06:08.580
So she was not at the home with me.

06:09.401 --> 06:21.139
So I went to the movie on December the 7th and got out of the movie and went by a filling station and the radio was blaring and I said, what's happening?

06:21.558 --> 06:24.364
Somebody said, did you hear what happened at Pearl Harbor?

06:24.444 --> 06:27.972
And I said, no, I didn't have them at Pearl Harbor and didn't pay much attention to it.

06:29.436 --> 06:36.411
Went on down the road a little ways and there was some more racket going on and I stopped and I said, what's happening?

06:36.472 --> 06:37.153
And they said,

06:37.538 --> 06:39.802
Well, the Japs had burned Pearl Harbor.

06:39.902 --> 06:42.126
And I said, my Lord, what's happened there?

06:43.047 --> 06:48.737
So I went on home and out at the camp, every radio in the camp was on, of course.

06:48.817 --> 06:57.813
And everybody was listening to the president speak and to everybody talking and deciding who was going to do what.

06:57.833 --> 07:01.379
And the activity really did pick up.

07:01.760 --> 07:01.960
Right.

07:02.294 --> 07:15.173
With the attack then obviously the Japanese became in their mind a bigger threat so your unit was moved to the west coast in the spring of 1942 I guess it was within the next spring.

07:15.213 --> 07:18.437
Talk about what your assignment was there, interesting assignment.

07:18.457 --> 07:31.997
Well we had, this was a regiment and the regiment had three battalions I guess it was and each battalion had four guns as I remember and we were, we had a mission

07:32.433 --> 07:36.238
all the way from San Francisco to San Luis Obispo.

07:36.958 --> 07:46.049
We had guns at Santa Cruz and San Jose and several different locations.

07:46.950 --> 07:53.218
And an interesting thing, one set of guns were right under the Golden Gate Bridge.

07:53.238 --> 07:57.563
And the purpose of that was the harbor defenses of San Francisco

07:57.863 --> 08:02.734
were the big guns up high so they could shoot way out.

08:03.496 --> 08:06.964
When I say big guns, those were 14 inch probably.

08:08.227 --> 08:14.100
And they could have come in underneath the defilade of the big guns.

08:14.519 --> 08:22.438
They put our guns right down under the Golden Gate Bridge, so if something came in under, we could take them on as a target.

08:22.458 --> 08:22.778
I see.

08:23.059 --> 08:32.882
So it's sort of interesting to know that part of our people served there for several months right under the Golden Gate Bridge.

08:32.862 --> 08:37.949
But my assignment at that time was I was a maintenance officer for the brigade.

08:39.070 --> 09:01.401
And the maintenance officer's responsibility was the maintenance of the entire regiment, which entailed traveling up and down the coast from one installation to the other to coordinate with the people as to the maintenance of the vehicles, tractors, and all the rolling stock.

09:01.955 --> 09:08.263
Another thing you told me was that they would have target practice, and you would lay out targets out in the water.

09:08.383 --> 09:10.626
We have a picture of one of those targets coming up later.

09:11.126 --> 09:20.438
But you supervised a survey crew that kind of laid the guns, and I guess you used your education as a civil engineer in using triangulation to do that.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.981
Talk a little bit about that.

09:23.001 --> 09:31.371
Well, people that know about triangulation or the two sides and the

09:33.342 --> 09:48.756
included the baseline, know that you can lay out the baseline with a known length, and you can then, by triangulation, tell how far the target is or how far you need to shoot.

09:49.537 --> 09:54.441
So part of my responsibility was to help lay out the baseline.

09:54.962 --> 10:00.987
It had to be known exactly the exact length, and I had to

10:01.338 --> 10:09.950
former survey crew out of these boys that didn't know an instrument from a pencil.

10:11.372 --> 10:19.824
So to start doing that I had to teach them a little bit of triangulation and a little bit of math and all that.

10:19.844 --> 10:22.127
So that was another one of my assignments.

10:22.227 --> 10:24.190
It turned out to be pretty good.

10:24.878 --> 10:30.349
So all you kids out there who think that math and arithmetic doesn't do you any good, you can prove them wrong.

10:30.389 --> 10:31.992
I can prove them wrong.

10:32.112 --> 10:32.392
Indeed.

10:33.014 --> 10:38.905
It was finally determined that the Japanese weren't going to attack the west coast of the United States.

10:39.340 --> 10:43.987
That job disbanded, and you went to Fort Rucker, Alabama when you were a captain.

10:44.027 --> 10:45.009
Sort of take us from there.

10:45.690 --> 11:01.655
Well, after they decided that Coast Artillery was losing its real importance or necessity, they took these boys that were in this Coast Artillery unit and made them into combat engineers.

11:02.876 --> 11:06.462
And they didn't need them on the West Coast, and

11:07.370 --> 11:11.535
So I took one of the battalions back to Camp Rucker, Alabama.

11:12.296 --> 11:19.144
I was the leading officer on the train with about 400 of the boys.

11:19.284 --> 11:24.570
And we traveled from California to Camp Rucker, Alabama.

11:25.531 --> 11:29.336
And I turned them over to the engineers there.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.900
And I was relieved from assignment from them.

11:33.361 --> 11:33.921
Right.

11:33.941 --> 11:35.503
It's about this time that you

11:35.939 --> 11:41.719
You received a two-month sale date to Europe, so you knew that you were going to go and be involved in the war in Europe.

11:41.739 --> 11:42.963
Well, I went first.

11:42.983 --> 11:44.669
I had to go to engineer school.

11:44.689 --> 11:44.970
Right.

11:45.440 --> 11:51.088
I applied to change my commission from Coast Artillery to Engineer.

11:51.970 --> 11:55.114
And they sent me to a six week school up at Fort Belvoir.

11:55.715 --> 12:01.924
When I got back from there, they had me assigned as a company commander for an engineer maintenance company.

12:02.766 --> 12:08.194
Which does all type of maintenance for any type of engineer equipment.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.979
Had 185 men and five officers.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.603
I didn't know not one single one of them.

12:15.140 --> 12:26.251
I had to learn all them as well as to get acquainted with being in command of this engineer unit and as you mentioned, we had a sailing date of two months.

12:26.471 --> 12:27.752
Right.

12:27.772 --> 12:29.034
Let's go ahead and move to that.

12:29.054 --> 12:40.405
That was February of 1945 is when you sailed and you talked about the trip over to France in a converted ocean liner and you weren't sure you were even going to make it to the war.

12:40.485 --> 12:41.586
That trip was so rough.

12:41.646 --> 12:42.447
Talk about that.

12:43.051 --> 12:51.392
Well, it was winter time and they told us we were going to travel what they called the northern route.

12:51.713 --> 12:57.347
I presume for as much safety from submarines as possible.

12:58.103 --> 13:06.913
There were probably 30 ships in the convoy, and we were circled by Navy vehicles all around for protection.

13:08.134 --> 13:14.982
And the second day out, we hit a storm, as they say, very usual in the northern route.

13:16.283 --> 13:23.031
And for two nights and one day, that ship turned every way over.

13:23.416 --> 13:46.251
would rock to the side and back the other way and the waves would go over the deck and the front end would come up off the water and come back down and pat like a dog and the rear end would come up and the propeller would go that way, you know, and there were 5,000 of us on the ship that

13:47.260 --> 13:53.747
In peacetime, I presume would have carried about four or five hundred passengers as a cruise ship.

13:54.848 --> 14:01.935
And that thing, there were 5,000 and I think 4,900 of them were six.

14:03.397 --> 14:06.921
And everybody wanted to be on the top bunk, as you can imagine.

14:07.882 --> 14:08.162
Right.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.263
But you made it.

14:09.363 --> 14:10.404
It was a 12-day trip.

14:10.484 --> 14:11.005
We made it.

14:11.265 --> 14:14.128
It landed at La Hague, France.

14:14.513 --> 14:19.699
Before we go to some photographs, talk a little bit about what your job was in Europe.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.721
I know that it was sort of a separate company.

14:22.622 --> 14:27.808
You finally went into Belgium, at Liage Belgium, and sort of talk about what your job was.

14:27.848 --> 14:32.113
I know you kept cranes in order that were unloading boats and all that.

14:32.133 --> 14:32.954
Tell us about what you did.

14:33.495 --> 14:40.723
Well, one of our big missions, after we got off and were in Hassel, Belgium for a while,

14:41.125 --> 14:50.069
Got our equipment all unpacked and finally got a mission and they sent us to Liège, Belgium.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.114
And Liège was on a big canal.

14:52.668 --> 15:00.079
It was a big engineer depot and they unloaded all the barges with cranes.

15:01.621 --> 15:05.507
Drag line is a better terminology for a lot of people.

15:07.390 --> 15:17.545
There were some 40 of those things unloading equipment and it took a whole lot of maintenance and maintenance people to keep those things going.

15:18.031 --> 15:25.900
And we also got equipment back from the front that had either been damaged or totally blown up.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.943
And we could either fix them or issue them a new one.

15:30.244 --> 15:39.194
And we repaired little generators or any type of engineer equipment.

15:39.915 --> 15:43.198
And a lot of these cranes that we were talking about were actually run by German POWs.

15:43.218 --> 15:43.819
They were.

15:44.137 --> 15:44.678
Interesting.

15:44.958 --> 15:45.559
Very interesting.

15:45.980 --> 15:49.826
And then later you were moved to Antwerp, I believe, and did essentially the same thing.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.246
Is that right?

15:50.266 --> 15:52.871
Well, one of my platoons went to Antwerp.

15:52.991 --> 15:55.875
Just one platoon went to Antwerp.

15:56.977 --> 16:01.804
And during that time, they were subjected to the buzz bombs that came over.

16:02.085 --> 16:02.405
I see.

16:02.906 --> 16:03.727
I see.

16:03.747 --> 16:05.230
Let's go to some pictures now.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.111
We've got...

16:06.378 --> 16:10.823
eight or nine photographs that you've supplied to us out of a magnificent photo album.

16:10.843 --> 16:12.445
And let's go to those and take a look at them.

16:12.465 --> 16:12.985
They're right there.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.108
If you can tell us that's a young Joe Hanover about how.

16:16.369 --> 16:19.812
I guess that's right when you... First went on active duty.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.114
When you first went on active duty.

16:21.895 --> 16:22.936
So you weren't very old then.

16:22.976 --> 16:23.577
What were you about?

16:25.158 --> 16:30.064
Well, that was in 41, I guess.

16:30.124 --> 16:32.086
So I was 23.

16:32.106 --> 16:34.208
About 23 years old.

16:35.234 --> 16:36.476
All right, raring to go.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.138
There's you and Lucille.

16:39.980 --> 16:46.509
You were married soon after you got out of Texas A&M because you said she wouldn't marry you until you got a degree and got a job, right?

16:46.549 --> 16:47.109
That's right.

16:47.129 --> 16:48.511
She told me that several times.

16:48.551 --> 16:52.757
And you did both of those, and you got married.

16:53.097 --> 16:53.357
Right.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.299
Good-looking couple.

16:54.339 --> 16:55.120
Where was that taken?

16:55.140 --> 16:55.620
Do you recall?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.903
That was taken at Camp Davis, North Carolina.

16:57.983 --> 16:58.264
OK.

16:58.664 --> 16:58.925
OK.

16:59.145 --> 16:59.786
In 1941.

17:00.827 --> 17:01.167
All right.

17:03.010 --> 17:04.752
Here's you and a buddy in an old automobile.

17:05.255 --> 17:12.006
That was a 1940 Plymouth that we bought just before they quit making them.

17:13.549 --> 17:16.574
And we drove that during the whole war.

17:16.594 --> 17:19.119
That was a friend of mine from up in Iowa.

17:19.479 --> 17:19.780
I see.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.182
Okay, let's move on.

17:22.925 --> 17:26.451
This is one of the targets that we were talking about off the west coast.

17:26.591 --> 17:28.174
You can see the pontoons.

17:28.660 --> 17:29.281
on it.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.944
So you all constructed this pretty much, right?

17:32.165 --> 17:37.391
Yeah, I built that with some of my troops and that was towed.

17:38.853 --> 17:42.838
It would float and it was towed about a thousand feet behind the towboat.

17:43.719 --> 17:47.985
So it wasn't in the danger of shooting and hitting the towboat.

17:48.245 --> 17:48.566
I see.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.889
Somebody hit the target you can see there.

17:50.909 --> 17:51.429
As you can see.

17:52.731 --> 17:53.532
Okay, let's move on.

17:54.594 --> 17:56.336
Tell us about, this was taken in Corpus Christi.

17:56.556 --> 17:57.317
Tell us about this.

17:58.242 --> 18:18.025
Well, I convinced the Army that we ought to learn to be transported by air for some thing it might develop that needed engineers and be too far away to go by truck.

18:18.185 --> 18:27.456
And after much convincing, they agreed to let the Air Force Reserve fly us out there.

18:27.959 --> 18:37.831
And we loaded equipment and men in those planes and flew from Corpus Christi to New Mexico.

18:40.093 --> 18:40.334
Wow.

18:40.874 --> 18:43.177
Those are big transports.

18:43.197 --> 18:44.018
Talk about this.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.921
This was a little bit later on.

18:46.942 --> 18:51.587
Well, we were working for the

18:53.255 --> 18:55.037
Air Force in San Antonio.

18:56.259 --> 19:08.876
And the fact that we were working with the Air Force, if I needed the plane to go on one of my reserve missions, they'd send me an airplane.

19:09.777 --> 19:11.340
And that's one of the trips.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.046
And I just took the advantage of sticking my head out and letting them take my picture.

19:16.847 --> 19:18.890
Just noticed my star on the plane.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.031
Yes, sir.

19:20.051 --> 19:21.253
Here's one of your promotions.

19:22.381 --> 19:31.896
Yes, that's General Cliff Semang, who was the brigade commander just prior to my assumption.

19:34.821 --> 19:38.187
That may be my star that he put on.

19:38.828 --> 19:45.358
Now this is you on the right, and you're sort of briefing some pretty high-ranking generals there.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.844
Yeah, we were always getting some

19:49.735 --> 19:56.102
and somebody would have to brief them as to what we were doing and what kind of progress we were making.

19:56.202 --> 20:05.711
And at the time, I was the operations officer and had the privilege of briefing the generals.

20:06.772 --> 20:07.333
Were you nervous?

20:09.015 --> 20:12.879
Well, I'd say no, but you know that's not right.

20:12.899 --> 20:13.659
Probably a lie, right?

20:13.699 --> 20:14.300
Probably were.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.182
At one time, we briefed

20:18.305 --> 20:19.527
12 stars.

20:19.667 --> 20:28.318
It was a four-star general, a three-star, a two-star, and two one-stars on the seat right in front of me.

20:28.499 --> 20:29.580
Oh my goodness.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.864
You had to be nervous that you were getting it right.

20:33.706 --> 20:36.169
Okay, and I believe this is our final picture.

20:37.290 --> 20:40.735
This is the Chief of Army Engineers in Washington.

20:41.322 --> 20:48.664
was privileged to go up on a visit one time and got the opportunity to visit with the chief of engineers.

20:48.684 --> 20:55.585
And that was what that picture was taken was in his office.

20:57.725 --> 20:58.746
That's some great photographs.

20:58.786 --> 21:03.671
I need to move along a little bit because I want to get you back to Brian to the 420th.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.054
But it ended up you didn't come home until 1946.

21:06.354 --> 21:09.437
You stayed over there a while even after the war was over.

21:10.158 --> 21:11.119
You had different duties.

21:11.139 --> 21:14.303
There were a lot of just downtime that you took a jeep and traveled around.

21:14.783 --> 21:17.166
You said you played a lot of baseball.

21:17.386 --> 21:21.230
You were even given a job over a company of German POWs.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.053
So there was a lot of things you did in Europe after the war was over.

21:25.163 --> 21:28.267
That was a most unusual assignment.

21:29.208 --> 21:36.618
There was a camp of German prisoners of war, about 6,000 of them, and they divided them up into companies.

21:37.759 --> 21:39.561
And they had a lot of work to be done.

21:39.701 --> 21:54.360
And they assigned me as a company commander of 250 Germans to do some electric work, carpenter work on tents that were being used to transport to

21:54.779 --> 22:00.387
people in route back home or to the Pacific or different places.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.151
Makes the tents a little bit more comfortable.

22:03.511 --> 22:07.477
I had that job for about three months.

22:07.637 --> 22:12.484
It's a little bit unusual to command a German company.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.285
I would imagine it was.

22:14.847 --> 22:18.314
February 1946, you finally get the orders to come home.

22:18.414 --> 22:26.330
Like many of the people who served in Europe, you originally thought that you were going to prepare to go to the Pacific for a ground war there.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.194
That obviously did not happen.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.903
You joined the 420th Engineering Brigade in Bryan over on Carson Street.

22:33.001 --> 22:36.825
And for most of your military career, that's where you were, 25 years there.

22:37.285 --> 22:39.527
Talk about that operation and that unit.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.870
In the last five years of your military career, you were its commander.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.532
Tell us about that.

22:44.552 --> 22:51.318
Well, we started, of course, like anything else, on a very limited scale.

22:52.219 --> 22:56.202
First time we went to summer camp, I think we went in two Greyhound buses.

22:56.262 --> 22:58.144
That was the extent of the brigade.

22:58.224 --> 23:02.468
And we probably had three or four typewriters.

23:02.448 --> 23:22.313
a few things like that very very small beginning as anyone would think and the brigade began to grow and assign different units under our command and we planned and

23:23.187 --> 23:26.895
coordinated activities of the number of people going to summer camp.

23:27.476 --> 23:39.863
The brigade at that time had under its responsibility all the engineer reservists, now be specific, engineer reservists,

23:39.843 --> 23:43.967
in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.

23:44.107 --> 23:48.011
We had unit stations in each of those states.

23:49.192 --> 23:59.742
And of course they had to go to summer camp in various places and we had to arrange for all that and find something for them constructively to do at a summer camp.

24:00.082 --> 24:06.728
It wasn't too hard to find work for engineers to do on a post or installation.

24:07.163 --> 24:14.434
You did a lot of travel to these four states, obviously, because you were the main guy in charge of supervising this, right?

24:14.454 --> 24:14.574
Right.

24:14.594 --> 24:18.339
And you talked about engineering is really a vast field, obviously.

24:19.040 --> 24:25.510
You were involved with Green Beret schools, even diver schools, and lots of other educational opportunities, right?

24:26.047 --> 24:30.035
Yeah, I went to several different schools.

24:31.077 --> 24:39.254
I went to USC one time for a week of military orientation of some siren.

24:40.236 --> 24:44.545
I went to Utah one time to what they called the

24:44.525 --> 24:50.214
CBS school, which is biological, chemical.

24:51.316 --> 24:53.980
I went to the Green Beret School in North Carolina.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.404
I went to Command General Staff School.

24:56.524 --> 24:58.567
I went to the Army War College.

24:59.749 --> 25:07.461
I had a great, great variety of opportunities during the time I was in that brigade.

25:07.913 --> 25:09.454
We've got just a couple of minutes left.

25:09.495 --> 25:12.858
I want you to talk about, I think that this is just fascinating.

25:12.918 --> 25:18.884
You and Lucille, you were married in 1940 after you got out of Texas A&M, but you actually started the first grade together.

25:18.904 --> 25:20.025
We did.

25:20.385 --> 25:23.088
So she was a lifelong partner, was she not?

25:23.108 --> 25:24.169
She was a lifelong partner.

25:24.949 --> 25:27.152
She was a great partner.

25:27.372 --> 25:35.980
Yeah, we dated all through high school and went to school in Wheelock.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.922
And at that time, you couldn't graduate.

25:37.982 --> 25:40.405
And we actually went to the 10th grade.

25:40.525 --> 25:47.193
And just before we got into the 10th grade, they started bussing the school to Franklin.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.918
So I actually graduated from Franklin High School.

25:51.038 --> 26:03.132
And she went to Waco to Business College and was there a year and got her degree as a stenographer and got a job at A&M.

26:03.702 --> 26:10.733
Of course, I was going to school and she was working and that's when I propositioned her to marry me.

26:10.753 --> 26:14.720
And 63 years that you all were together, we're just about out of time.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.883
I wish we had had more time to talk about it.

26:16.903 --> 26:19.888
I'll just mention it real quick about how in your retirement years,

26:20.341 --> 26:27.370
You went out to Hearn, and you bought the Railway Express office out there, and you moved it to Snook, and you've got a living house out there.

26:28.091 --> 26:29.733
That's just fascinating.

26:29.853 --> 26:37.863
I wish we could make a whole show just out of that, but thank you very much for your service, and congratulations in your retirement, and thank you for everything you've done.

26:37.883 --> 26:42.389
My pleasure, and Tom, I appreciate what you do for these shows.

26:42.449 --> 26:47.395
It's been a great education for me, and I know a world of people in the community.

26:47.536 --> 26:48.357
Well, I appreciate that.

26:48.457 --> 26:49.318
Thank you very much.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.179
Appreciate it.

26:50.598 --> 26:54.584
Joe and Lucille Hanover were married 63 years before her death in 2003.

26:54.625 --> 26:58.651
They had a daughter, Jo Seal, who lost a battle with leukemia in 1983.

26:58.771 --> 27:03.379
He lives in Bryan in the same house that he and Lucille built in 1957.

27:04.501 --> 27:08.848
Joe Hanover is indeed a son of the Brazos Valley, and we thank him for his service.

27:08.868 --> 27:09.970
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.133
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
