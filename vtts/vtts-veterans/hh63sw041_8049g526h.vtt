00:07.186 --> 00:29.932
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.952 --> 00:31.033
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.992 --> 00:39.299
Sometimes we forget exactly how young some of our World War II veterans were when they laid their short lives on the line for us.

00:39.319 --> 00:45.844
October 26, 1944, Jim Gordon of College Station flew his first B-24 mission over Austria.

00:46.325 --> 00:49.007
The next day, he celebrated his 19th birthday.

00:49.668 --> 00:56.294
He'd fly 34 more missions over Europe, most of them with the crew that he had been with since their training days back in Houston.

00:56.934 --> 00:58.976
One of those missions earned him a Purple Heart.

00:58.996 --> 01:01.999
It was all part of the life of a World War II tail gunner.

01:02.249 --> 01:06.315
And we're proud to have Jim Gordon, our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:06.335 --> 01:08.238
Jim, it's definitely proud to have you here.

01:08.258 --> 01:09.980
Let's talk about the early days.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.746
You grew up in Gilmer, Texas, and you wanted to come to Texas A&M.

01:13.806 --> 01:15.488
Sort of talk about how that all came about.

01:15.849 --> 01:18.653
Didn't really work out the way you wanted it to at A&M.

01:18.673 --> 01:21.417
Talk about the early days before you joined up.

01:21.437 --> 01:23.881
Well, I wanted to come to A&M.

01:23.901 --> 01:26.805
My older brother was here.

01:27.140 --> 01:33.891
So they had all these different programs, like a V-12, V-6, Army, Navy program, Air Force program.

01:34.472 --> 01:44.308
And if you could get into college early enough and get into one of these programs, there was a chance you'd get to get a commission or get to be a flying officer.

01:44.789 --> 01:48.675
Well, of course, that was my desire and everybody's desire, I guess, about then.

01:48.655 --> 02:16.182
So my superintendent of school, John Avery, he let Dick Barrett, another friend of mine, graduate this early in January, 4-3, and we came on down here and enrolled, and Dick enrolled in a Navy program and I enrolled in, or tried to get in the

02:16.600 --> 02:18.683
Air Force program, but it will fill up.

02:18.783 --> 02:22.067
So there wasn't any chance of me getting in until the next semester.

02:22.087 --> 02:27.394
So everybody thought, well, if you're going to get in the war, you better get in the war because this thing's going to be over.

02:28.996 --> 02:30.057
It wasn't.

02:30.077 --> 02:30.197
Right.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.320
It was getting to the late part of the war.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.682
So instead, you went to Houston.

02:34.202 --> 02:35.504
You went to work for the shipyard.

02:36.145 --> 02:37.567
You joined up in 1944.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.609
Sort of take us after that.

02:39.829 --> 02:41.832
A lot of people, when they first join up,

02:42.301 --> 02:46.126
One of the first places... Actually, I joined up in 43, in May of 43.

02:46.306 --> 02:47.207
Right, right.

02:47.387 --> 02:48.709
Inducted in 43.

02:48.829 --> 02:49.350
Right.

02:49.370 --> 02:55.177
And at Ellington Field, and they said, I said, when do I report?

02:55.217 --> 02:56.218
They said, we'll call you.

02:57.019 --> 02:59.122
And eight months later, they did.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.185
Like forever, you think, well, it's going to be over, you know.

03:03.187 --> 03:07.232
And they called us up on 8th of January, 1944.

03:07.412 --> 03:08.393
Right.

03:08.643 --> 03:24.357
And so there was a whole group of us that had volunteered, 50 of us, and they shipped us out to San Antonio for indoctrination and uniforms and shots and things like that.

03:24.691 --> 03:29.440
shipped us to Sheppard Field for basic training in January, if you can imagine.

03:29.580 --> 03:30.682
Right, in Wichita Falls.

03:30.703 --> 03:31.384
In Wichita Falls.

03:31.404 --> 03:33.307
So you were going north and it was getting colder.

03:33.348 --> 03:34.089
Getting colder.

03:34.109 --> 03:34.349
Yes.

03:35.271 --> 03:47.695
And then after basic training, they shipped us directly south again to Lareda, back to Chanky Clothes instead of ODs, and we took our gunnery training there.

03:48.316 --> 03:58.355
at the Andrew Gunnery train while they shipped us north again to Lincoln, Nebraska to crew up to meet the guys we were gonna fly with.

03:58.495 --> 03:59.778
And you weren't dressed for that, were you?

03:59.798 --> 04:00.038
No.

04:00.158 --> 04:00.800
It was snowing.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.831
I was, we'd been in khakis in Lareda and I got off the train in

04:07.840 --> 04:09.903
Lincoln, and it was snowing.

04:10.243 --> 04:11.785
And it was cold.

04:11.805 --> 04:16.932
So my buddy and I, old Don Fralick from Houston, we said we better do something.

04:17.553 --> 04:22.500
And so we got us up in Nebraska.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.502
They don't have gas and stuff.

04:24.522 --> 04:25.644
It didn't at that time.

04:25.884 --> 04:26.565
All of it was cold.

04:26.645 --> 04:27.927
All of it burned for fuel.

04:28.508 --> 04:32.633
So we had to get us around a big pot bed that stole, so we stayed warm.

04:32.613 --> 04:35.056
And so we arranged for that.

04:36.457 --> 04:44.226
And so from then, we were there about four or five days and they shipped us to Pueblo, Colorado.

04:44.366 --> 04:45.127
Exactly.

04:45.147 --> 04:50.713
And at Pueblo, that's where we crewed up on the way to Pueblo on a train to Pueblo.

04:51.074 --> 04:51.935
Right.

04:51.955 --> 05:01.185
And we were two days, I guess, on the train and had a meeting with the crew, the pilot and the co-pilot and a few of us.

05:01.621 --> 05:04.785
So the pilot introduced himself, and we all introduced ourselves.

05:04.845 --> 05:12.976
And he said, well, how did I get two ball gunners here?

05:13.256 --> 05:16.160
And I said, well, it's like this.

05:16.180 --> 05:21.807
I said, we both want to fly together on the same crew, so I'm going to be your tail gunner.

05:22.141 --> 05:24.224
and Fredrick is going to be your ball gun.

05:24.805 --> 05:27.168
So he said, well, how the hell did I get two Texans?

05:30.653 --> 05:34.198
I told him, I said, you just got back here.

05:36.501 --> 05:40.266
The crew was together, you went to Topeka, then eventually you went to the East Coast to Virginia.

05:40.286 --> 05:46.815
Yeah, after that, after we did our training at...

05:46.795 --> 05:47.937
Topeka?

05:47.957 --> 05:49.940
Not at Topeka, at Pueblo.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.961
At Pueblo, right.

05:51.061 --> 06:08.466
We got a delay in route home, a furlough, about 10 days, and then we reported back to Topeka, and we got some more shots, and three days later, we were on a train to Camp Miles Standish in

06:09.762 --> 06:11.505
Virginia, yeah, in Virginia.

06:12.206 --> 06:17.653
And this camp was a port of embarkation for every service there was.

06:18.214 --> 06:20.938
The rangers, everything.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.641
And those guys were crazy.

06:23.442 --> 06:30.212
Hell raising all the time, all night.

06:30.232 --> 06:32.415
24 hours a day, usually getting to sleep or nothing.

06:32.795 --> 06:34.257
So I was glad to get on the ship.

06:34.738 --> 06:35.379
I guess you were.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.824
You were on one of 172 ships.

06:39.158 --> 06:42.563
that convoyed across the Atlantic to Italy.

06:42.684 --> 06:47.932
It took us forever to load because there were so many ships.

06:48.413 --> 07:03.096
But we got set sail one afternoon about 6 o'clock, and we picked up our escort, naval escort, right outside of the danger zone.

07:03.797 --> 07:06.702
And we had our naval escort all the way over.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.066
Now this was nearly a month, 28 days that you were at sea.

07:09.086 --> 07:11.911
28 days it took us to get over.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.797
And through some pretty dicey weather sometimes, right?

07:14.817 --> 07:17.021
Yeah, we had some good weather.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.725
We had three days.

07:19.806 --> 07:26.698
In other words, when you want the chow, you didn't know whose mascot you were eating out of.

07:27.033 --> 07:29.158
Because the ship was rocking so well.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.762
It was rocking so well.

07:32.948 --> 07:35.354
But anything was good in those days.

07:35.916 --> 07:36.437
That's right.

07:36.798 --> 07:39.605
So the weather was pretty... In 28 days, I guess you... It was.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.392
And we had...

07:42.727 --> 07:51.442
one submarine attack on the way over, and that the Navy took care of.

07:53.406 --> 07:57.934
But then all of a sudden,

07:57.914 --> 08:02.619
The weather got pretty and we were in Italy.

08:02.639 --> 08:08.986
I mean, you know, it was just a change, just that big a change.

08:09.066 --> 08:09.326
Indeed.

08:09.346 --> 08:16.093
You docked it to Naples, Italy, I believe, and then eventually you took a train to what would be your home base in Panatella.

08:16.293 --> 08:19.717
We docked at Naples and were there for about three days.

08:20.998 --> 08:24.782
Some of the coldest weather you've ever been in and sleeping in tents.

08:25.336 --> 08:26.978
which was nothing unusual.

08:26.998 --> 08:29.000
We were going to do that the rest of our lives, it looked like.

08:29.121 --> 08:29.501
Exactly.

08:29.841 --> 08:45.019
And so we shipped out of there on a little narrow-gauge Italian freight train, and they took us up to Panatella, which was, I would say, 30 or 40 miles from Fogia.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.963
People know more about the map of Italy, Fogia.

08:48.504 --> 08:51.327
It was almost in the center.

08:51.982 --> 08:55.847
So that was our base for the rest of the time we were there until we finished up.

08:56.228 --> 08:57.630
That's where you flew in and flew out of.

08:57.650 --> 08:58.651
We flew in and flew out.

08:59.332 --> 09:00.113
You lived in the tent?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.214
Lived in the tent.

09:01.335 --> 09:02.016
Boy, how about.

09:02.036 --> 09:03.738
I think a little later we've got a picture of that tent.

09:03.758 --> 09:04.519
Oh, that's right.

09:05.881 --> 09:16.095
The day before your 19th birthday, your very first mission, and that mission was kind of exciting, but it was sort of a sign of what was going to come because you actually got hit on your first mission, right?

09:16.115 --> 09:17.196
Yeah, we did.

09:17.176 --> 09:19.098
We got hit on our first mission.

09:19.118 --> 09:33.293
And that night at the club, some of the guys said, Gordon, who'd you fly with today?

09:33.353 --> 09:35.655
And I said, oh, somebody by the name of O'Connor.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.118
And they said, fly away, O'Connor?

09:38.918 --> 09:39.579
And I said, yeah.

09:39.599 --> 09:43.403
They said, don't ever do that anymore.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.706
He wasn't the right person to fly with.

09:46.727 --> 09:47.408
He couldn't fly.

09:48.769 --> 09:54.315
Jim, talk about what it's like, what it was like to be a tail gunner on a B-24.

09:54.856 --> 10:00.042
I just, I can't imagine you're just alone, just sort of hanging over the earth there.

10:00.102 --> 10:05.868
Is it exciting and lonely, but you were confident because you had been well-trained, I know that.

10:06.109 --> 10:08.151
What was it like to be a tail gunner in World War II?

10:08.351 --> 10:10.774
Well, actually, it was, to me,

10:11.243 --> 10:15.730
I trained to be a ball gunner, which is a lower ball.

10:16.532 --> 10:20.498
But to me, it was the best position on the plane.

10:21.099 --> 10:26.468
I flew all the positions at one time or another as a volunteer to catch up when I was wounded.

10:26.488 --> 10:31.075
And at the nose gunner, you saw too much.

10:31.207 --> 10:34.172
And the tail gunner, you saw where you'd been.

10:34.212 --> 10:38.199
And that's where I always was to see where I'd been.

10:39.181 --> 10:44.270
But the nose gunner, you could see all the fighting and everything else.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.231
It'd pass you.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.960
So it was quite an experience.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.342
I enjoyed it.

10:51.743 --> 10:58.253
Right at the end of the war, we got a new L model, B-24, which gave us a stener and a tail.

10:58.854 --> 10:59.796
So it wasn't a turret.

10:59.856 --> 11:01.098
We didn't have to sit in the turret.

11:01.619 --> 11:07.508
So we could just sit back there, stand back there, lay back there, and there was just a stener, and you just...

11:07.488 --> 11:09.171
do your guns like that.

11:09.191 --> 11:09.652
Exactly.

11:09.772 --> 11:12.677
Made it a lot easier, a lot more comfortable.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.285
If you could say you enjoyed it, yes, I enjoyed it.

11:17.605 --> 11:24.397
Now, most of these 35 missions that you flew, you said the vast majority of them, you were hit in one way or another.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.302
It was hardly a mission went by that your plane wasn't

11:27.907 --> 11:29.368
didn't take some fire, right?

11:29.388 --> 11:30.870
So you were used to that.

11:31.410 --> 11:33.472
That's true.

11:35.033 --> 11:38.997
You were attacked every time by TALAC.

11:40.898 --> 11:45.563
That's from the 88 and 105 millimeter guns from the ground.

11:45.583 --> 11:49.146
And you were attacked a lot of times by fighters, by German fighters.

11:49.706 --> 11:56.192
But on a 35 mission thing, I would say that we were attacked

11:56.695 --> 12:00.000
At least 30 times, flack our fighters.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.202
Right.

12:01.222 --> 12:02.264
But you just kept on going.

12:02.384 --> 12:02.945
Oh, yeah.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.248
That bird was tough, right?

12:05.309 --> 12:07.212
You want to go back where you want to go to.

12:07.392 --> 12:08.373
Exactly.

12:08.393 --> 12:08.854
Exactly.

12:08.874 --> 12:10.216
You just continue your mission.

12:10.357 --> 12:11.018
Yeah, you go.

12:11.378 --> 12:15.945
And some guys get shot up, lose an engine, turn around and go back.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.249
And sometimes they made it, sometimes they didn't.

12:18.449 --> 12:22.095
And we did that one time when we were lucky and made it.

12:22.244 --> 12:48.505
right and uh but the engine goes out or gets shot out before we get to the target well what do you do you go on to the target or you turn around and go back and you call head head uh the colonel and ask you know wherever here we are what we're gonna do and he said he usually would say it's your it's your crew and so here you go right you make the decision you make your decision now we're talking about mission uh most of your missions i believe were to uh

12:48.485 --> 12:53.893
take out fuel supplies of the Germans, take out train tracks, train transportation?

12:53.953 --> 12:58.439
Anything to delay their war effort.

12:59.801 --> 13:07.692
The greatest thing I wanted to take out, I wasn't running, was the fighters, the German fighters.

13:08.144 --> 13:22.557
I like the man we wanted to take out was the fuel supply, like Philistine, and Vienna, and up at Nussbaum, and all the buchant fineries.

13:22.957 --> 13:26.305
And then we tried to take out the jet

13:26.487 --> 13:31.453
factories and refineries that made fuel for the jet planes.

13:31.473 --> 13:32.495
Exactly.

13:33.296 --> 13:37.621
We're going to talk about January of 1945, a mission that day when you were wounded.

13:37.661 --> 13:39.464
But first, I want to go to some photographs.

13:39.824 --> 13:44.290
These are some of the pictures that actually hang in your home that you let us borrow.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.152
And we're going to go to some of them right now.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.335
If we can go to the first one, Jim.

13:49.076 --> 13:51.279
There's a picture of young Jim Gordon.

13:51.299 --> 13:52.360
About how old were you there?

13:53.420 --> 13:55.362
19.

13:55.783 --> 13:56.744
You were 19 years old?

13:57.485 --> 14:00.088
So you were a young rookie right then.

14:00.128 --> 14:02.551
Right then, right.

14:03.652 --> 14:04.213
Good-looking airman.

14:04.233 --> 14:06.756
Now that's the one I was talking about a while ago.

14:06.776 --> 14:13.424
This is a B-24 that was actually flying in formation next to you, and this picture was taken from your airplane.

14:13.524 --> 14:15.446
Is that right?

14:16.808 --> 14:18.550
This is the one we refer to.

14:19.053 --> 14:22.037
throughout the Air Force, a black man.

14:22.057 --> 14:27.624
And that's the one that's hanging on the wall that's colored that I was talking to you about that I like to... That you have the painting of.

14:27.664 --> 14:28.745
I have the painting of.

14:29.186 --> 14:30.087
Right.

14:30.107 --> 14:31.128
So what are we looking at there?

14:31.268 --> 14:33.652
Obviously, we're talking about a plane in a lot of trouble.

14:33.752 --> 14:37.176
Actually, they're a box away from us.

14:38.057 --> 14:40.901
There's a box of seven planes between us.

14:40.921 --> 14:45.887
And so they just got a direct hit.

14:46.373 --> 14:53.982
In fact, the conversation over the intercom was, from our navigator was, old Stinovich is going to get hit.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.344
He's flying over that battery.

14:56.364 --> 14:57.746
And about that time, he got hit.

14:58.026 --> 15:04.394
There was only five shots in that battery, and the fifth one hit him.

15:04.414 --> 15:05.875
Now, that's how luck goes.

15:05.895 --> 15:10.260
Now, you told me that there was one survivor from this airplane as it's about to go down.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.482
How did that?

15:11.502 --> 15:13.444
He was evidently, nobody knows.

15:13.897 --> 15:19.966
except that they think he was standing on the catwalk and just watching the bomb burst.

15:20.226 --> 15:24.091
This was what we call a low-level mission at 20,000 feet.

15:25.053 --> 15:28.738
And so you could see pretty good the ground.

15:29.699 --> 15:37.470
And so he was standing out there and they got that direct hit in that engine there where it broke the engine off and flipped the airplane and it flipped him out.

15:37.490 --> 15:40.034
And he evidently, luckily, had his shoot on.

15:40.915 --> 15:43.178
He landed in an olive orchard

15:43.715 --> 15:55.878
and broke both legs and he was captured in a German prisoner of war camp and he became commander officer as a second lieutenant.

15:56.339 --> 15:56.961
My goodness.

15:57.642 --> 16:03.934
Now I want to keep this picture up there for just a second because this is our only picture really of a B-24.

16:04.302 --> 16:09.170
When you were flying in the B-24, we could look at the rear of the plane, we see the two gun barrels sticking out.

16:09.210 --> 16:12.115
That would have been your gun barrels on your plane, right?

16:12.135 --> 16:12.295
Right.

16:12.916 --> 16:13.036
Right.

16:13.056 --> 16:13.737
Right.

16:13.757 --> 16:20.568
And then you can see the nose capsule up there, and then what you call the down below.

16:20.608 --> 16:21.870
That's the... It's very bald.

16:21.890 --> 16:22.331
That's the bald.

16:22.351 --> 16:23.413
It's hidden behind the fire.

16:23.753 --> 16:23.914
Right.

16:23.934 --> 16:27.079
Actually, all you got to do is just do like that, and your plane is right side up.

16:27.159 --> 16:27.880
Exactly.

16:27.860 --> 16:31.083
That's a fascinating picture.

16:31.103 --> 16:32.604
It was a fascinating picture.

16:33.185 --> 16:34.506
You saw this happening.

16:35.427 --> 16:41.132
One of the, I guess, the most famous of Air Force pictures in World War II.

16:41.352 --> 16:42.593
So this plane was to your right?

16:42.914 --> 16:43.454
To my right.

16:43.774 --> 16:49.239
So you were actually looking, I guess, to your left out of the back to actually see this going on.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.582
Yeah, you were looking to your left because you were in the back.

16:51.742 --> 16:55.305
As the talk was going on, everybody switched on that.

16:56.106 --> 16:56.466
Wow.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.668
Okay, let's go on to the next photograph we have.

17:00.069 --> 17:00.850
Here's your crew.

17:00.870 --> 17:05.435
This is a picture that hangs in your office, and I know that you're very proud of it.

17:05.455 --> 17:08.118
And that's you sitting right there front and center in the middle.

17:08.138 --> 17:08.899
Yeah, 6 o'clock.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.960
Right there, right there.

17:10.721 --> 17:11.862
The smiling airman there.

17:11.962 --> 17:19.351
And that's your crew that you were with from when you all first reported in Houston all the way up.

17:19.451 --> 17:22.394
This was taken in Pueblo, Colorado in 1944.

17:22.715 --> 17:23.335
Right.

17:23.756 --> 17:25.778
And we were together until we got back.

17:26.382 --> 17:28.011
Two states.

17:28.031 --> 17:33.299
And I believe you told me that out of that group right now, there's three of you that are still living.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.485
Yes, three of us still living.

17:35.427 --> 17:39.593
Oh, well, I know that you get to see that picture every day, and I know that that means a lot to you.

17:39.613 --> 17:41.596
Let's go on to the next photograph.

17:41.956 --> 17:42.838
There's where you lived.

17:42.858 --> 17:43.619
That's the Hilton.

17:43.839 --> 17:45.301
That's the Hilton.

17:45.321 --> 17:47.004
That's the Panatella Hilton, right?

17:47.024 --> 17:47.825
Right.

17:47.845 --> 17:49.167
In Panatella, Italy.

17:49.187 --> 17:51.129
With all the room service you can imagine.

17:51.290 --> 17:52.311
How many lived in that tent?

17:52.712 --> 17:53.232
Six of us.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.674
Six of you.

17:54.715 --> 17:57.679
You see all the plumbing outside and everything?

17:57.699 --> 17:58.880
How nice it is?

17:59.101 --> 17:59.381
I do.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.024
I see that plumbing outside.

18:01.044 --> 18:04.168
I got to say, most of the plumbing was hopefully in the back.

18:04.148 --> 18:05.850
That's good.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.613
And you had some great landscaping there.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.214
Yes, it is.

18:08.815 --> 18:11.038
This was built in an olive orchard.

18:11.078 --> 18:12.700
Those were olive trees in the back there.

18:12.881 --> 18:13.962
Right, right.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.304
Well, that was home.

18:15.404 --> 18:15.905
My goodness.

18:16.426 --> 18:19.951
This is your brother that's in the cockpit of this plane.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.813
Talk about him.

18:22.194 --> 18:24.397
Well, Edwin was the Aggie.

18:27.902 --> 18:31.007
He was in the 8th Air Force.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.430
He was in the G Infantry here at school.

18:33.798 --> 18:36.882
as quickly as he got his commission while he transferred to the Air Force.

18:37.423 --> 18:41.327
And he got overseas a little later, a little after I did.

18:41.347 --> 18:49.217
He was signed to the 8th Air Force to 351, which was one of the, I think, the hottest fighter we had at that time in probably forever.

18:49.898 --> 19:03.535
And after he completed his missions, he went down to Munich, down in that area there, and did a year or two of Air Force occupation.

19:03.970 --> 19:09.378
Then came home, went back to A&M, and finished up six hours and graduated.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.222
I want to talk more about your family a little bit later.

19:12.242 --> 19:14.905
Let's go ahead and go to the next picture.

19:15.606 --> 19:20.573
This is one of your reunions with six of you there.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.257
This was probably 1989.

19:23.497 --> 19:26.181
You're standing in the middle, by the way.

19:27.022 --> 19:27.703
Yes, I am.

19:28.404 --> 19:31.108
1989 in Las Vegas.

19:31.848 --> 19:37.056
And my pilot's standing to my left shoulder there.

19:37.837 --> 19:39.179
The radio operator's out here.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.765
And Fredrick, the boy, is to my right.

19:42.785 --> 19:46.491
And Chuck Williams is over there to the right.

19:46.531 --> 19:49.355
Now Chuck was a, I'll tell you in a minute about Chuck.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.358
And Ed Gordon, who was no relationist,

19:51.710 --> 19:52.912
kneeling down there in the bottom.

19:53.533 --> 20:03.468
Chuck was a, he came to us as you form up and you build and you, you know, things fall apart.

20:03.608 --> 20:08.957
We had like two guys that got air shook all the time, could not fly.

20:09.337 --> 20:13.123
And, you know, true or false, you can't use them.

20:13.143 --> 20:14.325
So you replaced them.

20:14.643 --> 20:27.133
So Chuck came to us from a crew that had, Chuck was in town that day visiting his girlfriend and his crew was flying.

20:28.177 --> 20:33.403
And they crashed into one of those mountains out there, killed them all, and Chuck was the only one alive.

20:33.423 --> 20:35.965
And Chuck came with us and lived to tell about it.

20:36.126 --> 20:36.686
Oh, my goodness.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.468
What a sad story.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.690
But I'm glad that he lived.

20:40.711 --> 20:45.295
And there's three of you, out of those six that we just saw, there's three of you that are still alive.

20:45.856 --> 20:51.903
January 20, 1945, talk about that mission because you earned your Purple Heart that day.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.505
Talk about what happened to you.

20:54.525 --> 20:56.007
Well, it was...

20:56.459 --> 20:57.640
Just a regular mission.

20:57.660 --> 21:01.524
We were flying about 28,000 feet.

21:02.144 --> 21:04.006
It was 65 or low zero.

21:05.167 --> 21:08.990
And we got hit by a plaque.

21:09.011 --> 21:11.553
And I was the only one actually that got hit.

21:11.613 --> 21:15.697
It severed my oxygen mind.

21:15.717 --> 21:22.103
And so as we come off the target, why the pilot, he wasn't always called oxygen shells.

21:22.123 --> 21:25.926
And so you'd say tail okay, ball okay, waist okay.

21:26.446 --> 21:32.713
Well, when I didn't say, okay, well then they sent somebody back there looking at me.

21:32.753 --> 21:35.035
Well, there I was slumped over my control.

21:35.596 --> 21:40.742
Well, what had happened, one of my tubes had been severed and so I wasn't getting any oxygen.

21:40.762 --> 21:49.031
And so they grabbed an oxygen bottle off the wall and slapped it on me and brought me around and saved my life.

21:49.531 --> 21:52.775
Right, but you had been wounded.

21:52.795 --> 21:53.736
Yeah.

21:53.952 --> 21:55.294
Talk about seeing your ear.

21:55.314 --> 22:00.842
Well, this is what we were trained for, you know, to an emergency like that.

22:01.263 --> 22:10.897
And the navigator, LaRogers, came from the front of the plane to the back of the plane to give me first aid.

22:11.679 --> 22:16.045
So that night, they put me in the fourth field hospital.

22:16.345 --> 22:18.528
And I was sitting there on that table.

22:18.768 --> 22:24.376
Of course, you know, I hadn't drank a whiskey by then, you know.

22:24.396 --> 22:27.641
Sitting there on a gurney.

22:27.701 --> 22:30.605
And I was the last one.

22:30.625 --> 22:31.846
There was a lot of wounded that day.

22:32.027 --> 22:33.749
And I was the last one they got a hold of.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.291
Of course, I guess I was the least wounded.

22:36.092 --> 22:39.377
So I could look at my left.

22:39.917 --> 22:41.720
I could look to my left, and I could see my ear.

22:41.740 --> 22:44.023
Now, if you can look at your left and see your ear,

22:44.240 --> 22:46.883
You're wounded.

22:46.903 --> 22:55.955
But anyway, so the major, an old major surgeon, he said, Sergeant, I think we're going to have to cut your ear off.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.116
And I said, not mine.

22:57.537 --> 22:59.279
And he said, yes, sir.

22:59.980 --> 23:06.068
So there was a captain there that had just gotten back from New York Burn Institute, where they'd been training them.

23:06.528 --> 23:11.174
And he said, Major, let me have a few days with him.

23:11.194 --> 23:13.217
And he used penicillin on me.

23:13.602 --> 23:19.028
And I go, well, that was the first time penicillin was used in that theater.

23:19.209 --> 23:20.475
Right.

23:20.495 --> 23:21.942
And so that's how...

23:22.293 --> 23:24.115
how wonderful it was at that time.

23:24.135 --> 23:26.717
And so you were actually back flying with them.

23:26.737 --> 23:28.018
25 days I was back flying.

23:28.098 --> 23:28.899
And you were back flying.

23:29.599 --> 23:32.982
Back flying, so trying to catch up with the crew before they went home.

23:33.002 --> 23:37.186
We're starting to run a little short on time, but I want you to talk about that.

23:37.246 --> 23:46.034
You actually flew some missions with another group just to catch up with your crew because you all had pretty much promised each other you'd go home at the same time.

23:46.074 --> 23:49.317
So you wanted to get your 35 in the same time they got their 35 in.

23:49.337 --> 23:51.979
So I was flying every day, every other day.

23:51.959 --> 23:54.751
As fast as I could to catch up, and I caught up.

23:54.771 --> 23:55.916
And you did catch up.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.704
And you all went home together.

23:57.804 --> 23:58.628
Went home together.

23:58.945 --> 24:02.671
Talk about, real quick, you told me about you were a cigar smoker.

24:03.432 --> 24:05.495
And one time that became a real bad idea.

24:06.176 --> 24:07.398
What happened?

24:07.418 --> 24:11.264
Oh, well, this will break you from smoking cigarettes.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.366
Yeah, it will.

24:12.386 --> 24:14.890
I smoked cigarettes from I don't know when.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.452
I never smoked cigarettes.

24:16.552 --> 24:18.155
Smoked cigarettes.

24:18.555 --> 24:26.067
And so every time we'd get on, we'd take off, I always had a cigarette in my pocket.

24:26.654 --> 24:30.660
Well, I would get the oxygen when we had to put oxygen masks on.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.123
Well, I'd light my cigar up.

24:33.163 --> 24:35.627
And so let's just go on and go on.

24:36.148 --> 24:39.352
And cigars didn't burn very fast up in that high oxygen.

24:39.412 --> 24:40.534
They were very slow.

24:41.315 --> 24:45.841
Well, one day I was sitting back there in the sunlight smoking that cigar, and we got a direct hit.

24:46.703 --> 24:53.252
And this fuel, this everything from fuel hit me, and I was standing there.

24:54.447 --> 24:55.191
Smoking a cigar.

24:55.693 --> 24:58.708
Smoking a cigar.

24:58.728 --> 25:00.055
But there was so little oxygen.

25:00.075 --> 25:01.823
So little oxygen, it didn't call the fire.

25:01.844 --> 25:02.567
It didn't explode.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.665
Instead, I think you told me that the gasoline actually put out the cigar.

25:06.745 --> 25:07.105
We did.

25:08.047 --> 25:09.970
We put out the cigar.

25:09.990 --> 25:10.531
But I quit.

25:13.897 --> 25:14.779
That's a good reason to quit.

25:15.199 --> 25:16.061
Very good reason to quit.

25:16.742 --> 25:19.307
We've just got a couple of minutes left, and I do want to move on.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.831
You did go home with your crew.

25:22.332 --> 25:24.856
I want you to talk about your family because it's a fascinating story.

25:25.017 --> 25:28.082
I know all of your brothers, you and your brothers, they all served.

25:28.501 --> 25:33.311
You have children who served, and you have a great niece, as a matter of fact, that you have a picture of in your home.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.617
You're a family of military service, aren't you?

25:37.299 --> 25:38.000
Quite.

25:38.020 --> 25:38.261
Yes.

25:39.062 --> 25:39.844
In fact, all of us.

25:39.944 --> 25:45.936
I feel, as I can recall, son-in-law, everybody.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.643
But speaking of Debbie.

25:49.524 --> 25:50.225
That's a great niece.

25:50.265 --> 25:51.086
That's my great niece.

25:51.746 --> 25:53.288
She's a lieutenant colonel.

25:53.388 --> 25:55.030
I mean, she's a colonel, full colonel.

25:55.531 --> 25:59.055
And will be a lieutenant general, big general next time.

25:59.296 --> 26:05.503
And she's 34 years old, has flown in three or four wars.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.447
She's a tanker pilot.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.298
Of course, then you saw my brother.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.641
There was a pilot.

26:11.762 --> 26:15.531
And my son-in-law, you didn't see him.

26:15.571 --> 26:16.814
He was a helicopter pilot.

26:17.115 --> 26:19.862
And I believe you have a nephew that's serving in Iraq right now.

26:20.083 --> 26:20.804
Yeah.

26:21.586 --> 26:24.293
In fact, I have three of them.

26:24.610 --> 26:29.261
One of them is there right now, but they've been rotating in and out.

26:29.281 --> 26:31.105
You and your wife, Jean, have been married for 40 years.

26:31.586 --> 26:37.280
And for 40 years and still going, 56 years, you've been a pharmacist.

26:37.300 --> 26:37.861
And you know what?

26:37.881 --> 26:39.044
We're out of time.

26:39.284 --> 26:42.552
But we thank you very much for your service, and I wish we had more time to talk about it.

26:42.532 --> 26:43.493
but it goes fast.

26:43.553 --> 26:43.873
It does.

26:43.953 --> 26:44.434
Thank you, Jim.

26:44.634 --> 26:44.994
Thank you.

26:45.015 --> 26:45.575
I appreciate it.

26:46.256 --> 26:51.741
Like most all who survived World War II, Jim Gordon followed his military service with a civilian career.

26:52.122 --> 26:56.126
And for Jim Gordon, it was as a pharmacist now for some 56 years and counting.

26:56.866 --> 27:01.872
He comes from an extended family of military service, and he is as proud of that as anything else.

27:01.892 --> 27:05.595
We thank Jim Gordon, his family, and all veterans for their service.

27:05.615 --> 27:08.198
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:08.218 --> 27:10.020
I'm Tom Turbiville for Jim Gordon.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.302
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
