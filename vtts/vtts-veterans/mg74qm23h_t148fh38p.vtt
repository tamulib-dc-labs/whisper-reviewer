December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.

00:12.292 --> 00:15.980
We interrupt this broadcast brings us important voting from the United Press/

00:16.000 --> 00:18.867
Washington, the White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
[Music.]

00:31.638 --> 00:33.861
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.881 --> 00:34.962
I'm Tom Turbeville.

00:36.043 --> 00:51.561
The path that Dick Deiterich took from Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania to the Brazos Valley included an 18-month hitch in the Army that started soon after Japan surrendered, but before President Truman officially declared the end of hostilities in December of 1946.

00:52.001 --> 00:58.168
So he served stateside, sent from base to base and eventually to Fort Knox, Kentucky.

00:58.503 --> 01:04.534
to help forward mail to returning servicemen and those headed back overseas for post-war duty.

01:04.554 --> 01:15.494
His is one of those stories of service that he might not call remarkable, but we call essential, as was anyone who gave up the important time of their youth to serve their country.

01:16.075 --> 01:19.161
So please welcome Dick Deiterich to Veterans of the Valley.

01:19.647 --> 01:24.033
Dick, thank you for your service, first off, and thank you for being our guest.

01:24.053 --> 01:26.757
As we said, you were born in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.

01:26.777 --> 01:27.938
What part of the state is that in?

01:27.958 --> 01:28.800
That's on the river, right?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.502
Well, it's on the Susquehanna River.

01:30.562 --> 01:34.007
It's about 75 miles up the river from the capital, Harrisburg.

01:34.347 --> 01:34.607
Right.

01:35.689 --> 01:36.971
We talked a little bit about this.

01:36.991 --> 01:39.594
You were around 13 years old.

01:39.634 --> 01:42.919
You were a teenager, a young teenager, during World War II.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.186
You turned 18 and actually signed up in the Air Force

01:48.622 --> 01:51.826
or in the army, excuse me, in the army on your 18th birthday.

01:52.567 --> 01:59.696
But talk about sort of what it was like when you were going to school and the war was going on, the war news was coming across.

01:59.777 --> 02:02.700
And were you taught about the war in classes, in schools?

02:02.720 --> 02:03.602
Do you recall that?

02:03.622 --> 02:04.643
I don't recall that.

02:04.723 --> 02:11.992
I remember seeing the news when we would go to the movies, the PathÃ© News would tell about the war and how things were going.

02:12.713 --> 02:18.561
And I remember the rationing, the stamps, and you couldn't get shoes.

02:18.895 --> 02:23.742
sugar, and I wasn't a smoker, but you couldn't get cigarettes either.

02:23.762 --> 02:24.884
It was very difficult.

02:25.745 --> 02:31.773
And they were selling war bonds, and you actually could buy stamps that you put in a book.

02:31.794 --> 02:39.525
And when you got $18.75 worth of stamps and the book, you could trade it in for, at that time, they were called war bonds.

02:40.466 --> 02:41.207
Right, right, right.

02:41.423 --> 02:48.832
I guess you were around 13 years old, 13 or 14, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and you said that you can recall that Sunday and what you were doing.

02:48.852 --> 02:50.194
I remember that day very well.

02:50.234 --> 03:00.347
We were out in the street in front of the house throwing a football back and forth, and someone had come out and said it was on the radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked.

03:00.367 --> 03:00.627
Right.

03:01.067 --> 03:04.312
1946, it was after hostilities actually had ended.

03:04.912 --> 03:06.334
Japan had surrendered.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.664
I graduated from high school in June of 45.

03:09.965 --> 03:13.871
I was 18 in January of 46.

03:14.232 --> 03:16.376
January 3rd, you turned 18.

03:17.037 --> 03:21.324
Instead of being drafted, you went ahead and enlisted in the Army for a year and a half hitch.

03:21.404 --> 03:22.225
Talk about that.

03:22.245 --> 03:27.394
Well, I really had always been interested in airplanes all my life.

03:27.661 --> 03:29.304
It was impossible at that time.

03:29.324 --> 03:31.848
They weren't looking for pilots or anybody else.

03:31.868 --> 03:36.796
And so the only other thing I had to do was join the Army.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.863
I knew if I was drafted, I might be put in the Navy and I couldn't swim.

03:40.963 --> 03:45.571
So I decided, well, I better go ahead and try the Army for a year and a half.

03:45.591 --> 03:46.112
Right.

03:46.132 --> 03:52.423
You went to Fort Meade, Maryland for your basic and you took... I was inducted at Fort Meade.

03:52.543 --> 03:53.905
Right.

03:54.577 --> 04:04.360
We were given tests there, and I thought I'd go to the infantry since I didn't have any choice, but they sent me to the quartermaster in Camp Lee, Virginia, where I took my basic.

04:04.380 --> 04:04.621
Right.

04:04.681 --> 04:09.312
You spent eight weeks there, and you said that for a guy from Pennsylvania, you remember Virginia being pretty cold.

04:09.494 --> 04:13.300
Yes, even though I was used to cold weather, I remember it was cold.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.104
I don't think we had all that much heat in the barracks.

04:16.245 --> 04:19.249
Right, because in Pennsylvania, you hadn't traveled much of anywhere.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.712
You were a long way from home, right?

04:20.732 --> 04:21.894
Yeah, I really was.

04:21.994 --> 04:30.147
I'd been to New York State, and that's actually the only place out of the state of Pennsylvania I'd been until I joined the Army.

04:30.347 --> 04:30.627
Right.

04:30.728 --> 04:37.358
You said that you remember in high school, one sort of experience with the war is that you had seen some German POWs at a camp in Pennsylvania.

04:37.338 --> 04:41.346
Well, I belonged to the Civilian Air Patrol cadets.

04:42.087 --> 04:47.138
And once a year, we would get to go to an Air Force base.

04:47.158 --> 04:50.104
And the first time, we went to Rome Air Force Base in New York.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.687
That was the time I was in New York State.

04:52.128 --> 04:56.376
And the other time, we went to Reading Air Force Base in Pennsylvania.

04:57.132 --> 04:59.476
And there were German POWs there at the time.

05:00.357 --> 05:13.437
And my wife related to me later that her father was in Tennessee, and they were having a logging company that did logging, and they had German prisoners.

05:13.501 --> 05:27.065
And my stepson was just a baby and my father-in-law took him on the job and one of these German prisoners asked him, said, could he hold the baby?

05:27.085 --> 05:28.828
And he said, well, why?

05:28.848 --> 05:32.233
He said, well, I have a son about that same age at home.

05:32.254 --> 05:33.656
And so he let him hold the baby.

05:33.876 --> 05:34.177
Wow.

05:34.197 --> 05:34.277
Wow.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.763
That must have been a very moving moment, I'm sure.

05:36.783 --> 05:37.464
I'm sure it was for them.

05:37.484 --> 05:38.545
Obviously for the German soldier.

05:38.565 --> 05:39.466
Yeah, oh yes.

05:39.486 --> 05:42.670
Yeah, and for your young stepson at the time.

05:43.111 --> 05:43.231
Right.

05:43.251 --> 05:43.732
At the time, sure.

05:43.752 --> 05:46.135
Then you went a long way from home.

05:46.155 --> 05:49.099
You went all the way to Georgia, to Oglethorpe in Georgia.

05:49.119 --> 05:50.481
Talk about what your duty was there.

05:50.501 --> 05:57.550
Well, after basic training, I was sent to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia for the postal class.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.693
I studied to be a postal clerk.

06:00.093 --> 06:03.378
It was actually called the Adjutant General School.

06:03.398 --> 06:03.538
Mm-hmm.

06:03.518 --> 06:08.383
And after that schooling was over, I was sent back to Camp Lee.

06:09.484 --> 06:11.986
And they really didn't have a lot for us to do there.

06:12.026 --> 06:16.310
I think we went into town and picked up mail, but it really wasn't much of a job.

06:16.370 --> 06:19.734
And next thing I knew, we were sent back to Fort Overthorpe, Georgia.

06:20.695 --> 06:28.142
And they had us loading these boxcars with all this equipment, and we didn't know exactly what it was.

06:28.162 --> 06:31.365
And then I got transferred to Carlisle Barracks.

06:31.818 --> 06:35.568
And when I got to Carlisle Barracks... And that's back in Pennsylvania, close to your home, right?

06:35.588 --> 06:42.205
Yes, this is only about less than 100 miles from my home, which made me happy because I could go home every weekend.

06:42.225 --> 06:42.385
Right.

06:43.951 --> 06:48.737
But when I got up there, here the train was that we loaded was there.

06:48.757 --> 06:50.159
And so we unloaded the school.

06:50.199 --> 06:56.427
And what they were doing, they were relocating the school from Fort Oglethorpe to Carlisle Barracks.

06:56.448 --> 07:04.598
I was only there about a month when I was, I guess this is what we were officially, became the 117th Army Postal Unit.

07:04.879 --> 07:11.207
And I was sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky, assigned to the 7th Army, the armored division.

07:11.592 --> 07:20.995
Talk about your duty there because that's where you sort of continued as far as postal service and talk a little bit about what you did there and how you went about doing it.

07:21.211 --> 07:28.338
My job there was that any mail that came in for servicemen that had left the post would come to us.

07:29.118 --> 07:33.783
And we had these boxes with their newest address on there.

07:34.463 --> 07:44.192
And we would look them up and forward the mail to where they had been assigned or if they were going overseas or wherever they were.

07:44.252 --> 07:47.936
Their latest address we put on there and forwarded that mail on.

07:48.096 --> 07:48.396
Right.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.678
So these were soldiers that had been overseas.

07:51.097 --> 07:56.365
that were coming home and being assigned, either staying in or assigned or going home or wherever,

07:56.682 --> 08:00.347
It was your job to sort of research and look and find out where they are so that they'd get their mail.

08:00.728 --> 08:04.332
Actually, most of them were actually going over or being assigned overseas.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.214
Back overseas.

08:05.234 --> 08:05.614
Yes.

08:05.634 --> 08:05.875
Right.

08:06.035 --> 08:09.520
And so it was your job to find out where they were assigned and to get their mail to them.

08:09.540 --> 08:10.120
Get the mail to them.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.823
It was like mail coming from home.

08:11.843 --> 08:12.424
Right.

08:12.444 --> 08:14.046
So you were pretty much their hero, right?

08:14.627 --> 08:15.648
I don't know about that.

08:15.668 --> 08:19.113
They didn't know that you were their hero, but you were the guy that was getting their mail to them.

08:19.153 --> 08:22.177
So that obviously meant a lot to them.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.719
How long were you at Fort Knox?

08:24.205 --> 08:25.066
Six months.

08:25.226 --> 08:26.227
You were there for six months.

08:26.628 --> 08:28.811
Yeah, I got discharged from Fort Knox.

08:28.831 --> 08:29.772
From Fort Knox, yeah.

08:29.872 --> 08:36.120
We got a picture coming up a little bit later of you performing that duty at Fort Knox.

08:38.462 --> 08:39.363
So you were discharged.

08:39.404 --> 08:42.908
You got out in June of 1947 and had a tough time getting home.

08:42.928 --> 08:45.391
You had to thumb it, right?

08:45.411 --> 08:46.572
Well, money is always tight.

08:46.612 --> 08:49.656
It was always tight when I was young.

08:49.923 --> 08:51.205
So we did hitchhike home.

08:51.285 --> 08:52.687
That was quite an adventure.

08:52.707 --> 08:54.971
I know one time we got picked up.

08:54.991 --> 08:56.072
There were several of us.

08:56.092 --> 08:59.377
And we were picked up by some guys in a pickup truck.

08:59.397 --> 09:00.719
And we were in the back of the truck.

09:00.739 --> 09:03.083
And we really didn't know they'd been drinking a little bit.

09:03.123 --> 09:05.106
So we even went off the road one time.

09:05.146 --> 09:07.309
So we were glad we got off of that ride.

09:07.609 --> 09:09.973
But I eventually got home safely.

09:10.414 --> 09:12.737
And they say that you didn't have combat duty.

09:12.757 --> 09:15.601
If anything, it was just getting out of that truck, right?

09:15.621 --> 09:16.723
Right.

09:17.108 --> 09:26.979
I met you just a few weeks ago as part of the American Legion, but your history with the American Legion goes back to even when you were discharged from the Army.

09:26.999 --> 09:27.340
Talk about that.

09:27.360 --> 09:36.090
As soon as I got out of the Army, I came back to Bloomsburg and I joined the American Legion post there.

09:36.911 --> 09:39.534
And they had a drum and bugle corps and I got into that.

09:40.135 --> 09:42.998
I wasn't a musician and it's kind of strange in a way.

09:43.180 --> 09:51.079
We only had one guy in there that could read music but he would play what we were going to play and then everybody would listen and the rest of us would play it by ear.

09:51.099 --> 09:56.852
But we participated in parades and at one time we had a competition in Philadelphia

09:57.052 --> 09:59.074
And we paraded in Philadelphia too.

09:59.134 --> 10:09.867
And then besides that, when we had military funerals, I would be off to the side and I would play taps at the service.

10:10.047 --> 10:10.367
Right.

10:10.387 --> 10:12.770
Had you played the bugle before you did that?

10:12.810 --> 10:15.213
You just sort of learned it by ear?

10:15.493 --> 10:16.334
Learned it by ear.

10:16.414 --> 10:21.760
I know the American Legion, the Earl Graham Post here is very, very much involved in the

10:22.094 --> 10:24.437
There's a funeral court, there's a funeral activity.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.738
Do you involve yourself in that?

10:25.758 --> 10:27.280
No, I'm not a member of the Honor Guard.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.441
The Honor Guard, right.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.484
Yeah, they do quite a few of them.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.525
Yeah, yeah.

10:31.545 --> 10:38.653
I want to talk about the local American Legion and the involvement in that because they do such a great job there.

10:41.016 --> 10:48.945
You talked about the story about how your father-in-law lived in Tennessee and your stepson being held by the German soldier.

10:49.345 --> 10:49.926
You got out.

10:50.767 --> 10:51.848
Work was hard to come by.

10:52.081 --> 10:54.966
And we've heard a lot about the 5220 Club.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.731
Tell people what that is and how you got involved in it.

10:57.791 --> 11:04.062
The 5220 Club was where veterans could get $20 a week for 52 weeks.

11:04.142 --> 11:06.085
And so we call it the 5220 Club.

11:06.526 --> 11:09.071
And you had to go down each week to get your money.

11:09.091 --> 11:13.418
And if they had a job for you, I mean, you went and worked instead of getting the 20 bucks.

11:13.979 --> 11:14.460
Well...

11:15.892 --> 11:31.763
They had a job for me and it was at an orchard and I was picking peaches and it lasted five days and I worked eight hours a day for five days and I made 50 cents an hour and that was the same 20 bucks that I would have got free.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.232
But you got the 20 bucks each week for 52 weeks whether you worked or not.

11:36.252 --> 11:36.432
Right.

11:36.614 --> 11:36.954
Right.

11:36.974 --> 11:41.659
How often were you, so you had to go to get your 20 bucks and find out then whether or not they had a job for you.

11:41.739 --> 11:42.379
Correct.

11:42.399 --> 11:44.141
So sometimes you didn't work and you got your 20 bucks.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.422
Most of the time we didn't.

11:45.542 --> 11:47.664
Most of the time you didn't.

11:47.684 --> 11:50.647
So that, but 20 bucks a week, even back then.

11:51.227 --> 11:51.908
That was a lot of money.

11:51.928 --> 11:52.749
That was a lot of money.

11:52.769 --> 11:54.050
Were you able to stretch it pretty far?

11:55.271 --> 11:58.554
Well, I didn't, yes, it was only money I would, I could have, I would have.

11:58.574 --> 12:03.218
Well, I got a little money when I got discharged, but it wasn't a lot either, a couple of hundred dollars.

12:03.618 --> 12:04.779
Right, right, right.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.621
How, a lot of people were,

12:07.175 --> 12:12.964
a lot of people that had been veterans that had been were in this 5220 program?

12:13.044 --> 12:13.926
Oh, yes, yes.

12:14.707 --> 12:17.070
Yeah, that's just how it worked.

12:17.090 --> 12:20.115
So that's how the taxpayer dollar helped at the time.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.317
And you appreciate it, right?

12:21.357 --> 12:22.679
Right, right, right.

12:22.980 --> 12:29.249
You were out of the Army just over a year, and that's when the state of Texas came into your plant.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.193
You were in Pennsylvania, I guess.

12:31.253 --> 12:34.077
So what led you to Texas?

12:34.293 --> 12:52.837
Well the only jobs really that were open there, I had worked in a grocery store there too, but the only jobs were in stores or we had canning factories and we also had mills, silk mills and woolen mills and the big carpet mill was there too.

12:53.298 --> 12:58.765
That was really the only jobs that you had and that really didn't interest me.

13:00.078 --> 13:04.546
I really wanted to go to college when I came back out, but it just wasn't financially able.

13:04.566 --> 13:14.883
I thought I might be able to go to the college there in Bloomsburg, but I was going to have to go out near Pittsburgh, and I had no money, and the parents, they didn't have any money to support me on that.

13:16.185 --> 13:25.461
So I found out that there was some fellows that had been down to Houston and worked for oil companies, and some of them had come back, and we heard that that was a pretty good...

13:25.711 --> 13:53.980
place to try to find a job. So there were three of us decided we would go to Houston but one of them backed out, and we went to the hotel where they sold the bus tickets, and we bought a one way ticket and they were about that long all the different stops and all to Houston. And when we got to Houston my buddy who was 21 he got a job with Shell Oil Company he stayed there until he retired but I was only 20

13:54.247 --> 13:55.129
So they wouldn't give you a job.

13:55.149 --> 13:56.511
And they wouldn't hire me.

13:56.531 --> 14:12.982
And we were rooming and boarding with a lady, manned at the First National Bank, and she got me a job there at the bank, and I was making $125 a month plus 10% cost of living bonus, which turned it out to be $137.50 a month.

14:13.262 --> 14:13.763
Right.

14:13.783 --> 14:16.288
Well, you went from $80 a month to

14:16.268 --> 14:18.855
5220 Club to $137 a month.

14:18.895 --> 14:20.639
So that was quite a raise.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.589
I managed to make it work.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.895
But you were paying $15 a week for room and board, right?

14:27.196 --> 14:27.376
Right.

14:27.417 --> 14:28.539
So that was $60 of it.

14:29.382 --> 14:32.269
So almost half of it was going for your room and board.

14:32.249 --> 14:36.173
And you stayed there for four years at the First National Bank.

14:36.193 --> 14:37.154
First National Bank.

14:37.234 --> 14:43.360
And then I got a position with Houston Station Door Company as an assistant bookkeeper.

14:43.480 --> 14:43.700
Right.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.204
Now you'd gone to the University of Houston and studied accounting and the GI Bill.

14:47.804 --> 14:52.789
I used the GI Bill, which is one of the wonderful benefits of being in the Army.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.191
And all of my schooling was night school.

14:55.231 --> 14:58.675
I went to the University of Houston night school for about five years.

14:58.695 --> 15:01.597
But it wasn't enough time to get a degree.

15:01.618 --> 15:02.138
But I did

15:02.472 --> 15:04.818
get a lot of accounting experience.

15:05.018 --> 15:11.053
And eventually the man that was the head bookkeeper, he passed away and I fell into the job.

15:12.497 --> 15:15.063
Houston Door and Sash, and you were there for 22 years.

15:15.143 --> 15:16.707
Yes.

15:16.727 --> 15:17.910
A lot of memories there.

15:17.930 --> 15:19.654
I think you said soon after you left,

15:20.191 --> 15:21.072
they went bankrupt.

15:21.152 --> 15:22.755
Yes, they did.

15:23.316 --> 15:25.919
So they lost their accountant and they went bankrupt.

15:25.939 --> 15:26.961
What does that say?

15:26.981 --> 15:28.483
I must say you were a pretty good accountant.

15:28.503 --> 15:30.466
They shouldn't have lost you.

15:30.526 --> 15:31.067
I don't know.

15:31.808 --> 15:33.090
I got behind a little bit.

15:33.110 --> 15:35.393
I think maybe that's the reason I wasn't there.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.356
They hired two people to take my place.

15:37.336 --> 15:40.239
But they still didn't make it much longer after I was there.

15:40.279 --> 15:41.620
It took two people to take your place.

15:41.861 --> 15:42.882
Let's take a look at some pictures.

15:42.902 --> 15:47.887
We've got three or four photographs that you've supplied us of you and your youth.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.551
And one of them is going to be the person we're going to see is of unit.

15:51.591 --> 15:53.573
Talk about where this was taken.

15:53.613 --> 15:58.278
This was taken at Fort Knox, and I think we were getting ready for a parade.

15:58.578 --> 15:59.339
You're on the bottom right.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.521
And I'm on the bottom right.

16:01.771 --> 16:10.005
Why I don't have my rifle or carbine, I don't know, but it doesn't look like it's in the picture, but that's what that picture was.

16:10.185 --> 16:11.107
Getting ready for a parade.

16:11.608 --> 16:13.871
Yeah, and that's me on the right.

16:14.392 --> 16:15.314
I'm the shortest one.

16:16.155 --> 16:20.843
I weighed a soaking wet about 120 pounds at the time I went in the service.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.919
Now you're on the right, and I've got to tell the story.

16:22.939 --> 16:27.804
Your wife, Wanda, says that you look a little like Barney Fife in that picture, and I've got to agree with her.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.330
I can see that guy talking to Andy right there.

16:34.511 --> 16:35.792
Where was this one taken?

16:35.892 --> 16:40.257
Okay, this one was taken right outside the post locator where we worked.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.019
That was the building in the background there.

16:42.539 --> 16:45.943
I'm the one in the middle with the jacket and the cap on.

16:46.023 --> 16:47.765
Right, second from the right.

16:47.985 --> 16:48.265
Yes.

16:50.708 --> 17:04.742
And this is me at work, going through the cards, looking for, as you can see, I see there's the envelope and I'm looking for his name and new address so that I can redirect that piece of mail.

17:04.762 --> 17:05.023
I see.

17:05.043 --> 17:06.684
So this is what you did.

17:06.724 --> 17:11.429
This was your job and that's the place that you did it there at Fort Knox.

17:11.449 --> 17:11.669
Yes.

17:11.950 --> 17:15.313
Looks like that might have gotten to be a lonely place every once in a while.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.336
But how many people were doing the same job that you were doing?

17:18.772 --> 17:20.834
Probably about three or four.

17:21.274 --> 17:25.979
I think we had about 12 or 15 in our group in the postal unit.

17:26.119 --> 17:26.500
Right.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.141
You worked every day or did you get a day off?

17:29.102 --> 17:29.863
We worked every day.

17:29.883 --> 17:30.564
Just worked every day?

17:31.044 --> 17:31.164
Yeah.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.986
We probably had the weekends off.

17:33.006 --> 17:33.246
Yeah.

17:33.747 --> 17:34.247
Right.

17:34.267 --> 17:35.929
What did you do for recreation?

17:35.989 --> 17:36.770
What did you remember?

17:36.870 --> 17:39.192
Did you go into town, go to movies?

17:40.153 --> 17:46.459
Well, I remember they had the Kentucky Derby there, but I wasn't interested in horse racing at the time, so I missed a big event.

17:46.579 --> 17:47.260
Yeah.

17:47.442 --> 17:55.430
Some of the other guys went, and they had the Indianapolis 500 at that time too, which was an interest of mine, but I didn't get to go to that either.

17:55.450 --> 18:00.716
But we would go to town and just go to the parks mostly.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.097
Right, right.

18:02.117 --> 18:07.823
You left Houston Session Door in 1975, and you worked for some other building material places.

18:08.364 --> 18:13.129
Last job was a controller at Weston Lakes Country Club, is that right, in West Houston.

18:13.632 --> 18:16.315
Talk about what brought you to the Brazos Valley.

18:16.435 --> 18:21.841
You and your late wife, Mayful, had moved to Grimes County, right, and built a house?

18:21.861 --> 18:21.941
Yes.

18:22.902 --> 18:35.155
Well, after I'd gotten rose up in the country at Houston Sash and Door, I was the vice president and assistant secretary.

18:35.175 --> 18:39.960
I was making pretty good money, and some of us decided we ought to buy some land.

18:39.940 --> 18:53.841
So I need to thank my wife for this because she went up and found this land and we bought 45 acres at Singleton, Texas, which is State Highway 90 actually ran through the property.

18:53.861 --> 18:57.527
We had 40 acres on one side and five on the other.

18:57.507 --> 19:02.073
And that was in 1970 I bought that property.

19:02.093 --> 19:05.778
And in about 81, we built a house up there.

19:05.818 --> 19:10.585
And we had a trailer up there at first, and we would go up and spend time on that trailer.

19:10.605 --> 19:11.847
But then we finally built a house.

19:12.508 --> 19:16.473
And we would go up there and spend time on the weekends.

19:16.493 --> 19:21.540
And when we retired in April of 1990, we moved up there.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.098
And you did retire in 1990.

19:24.158 --> 19:27.862
Now, you lost your wife, your first wife, Mayfield, in 1997.

19:27.942 --> 19:37.394
And you visited with me earlier about the effect that that had on you and the depression because you knew that she was sick before she passed away.

19:38.155 --> 19:47.646
Talk as much as you want to about that, but what it leads into is just sort of your interest in aviation that had gone back to when you were a youth, how that was able to fulfill itself.

19:47.913 --> 19:49.456
and help you get out of the depression.

19:49.476 --> 19:50.097
Talk about that.

19:50.117 --> 19:52.221
Well I went into severe depression.

19:52.261 --> 19:53.003
She was in St.

19:53.043 --> 19:54.406
Joe's and they put me in St.

19:54.446 --> 20:03.323
Joe's at the same time and my depression was so bad that they didn't have the facilities to treat me there so I was transferred to

20:04.602 --> 20:10.635
UTMB in Galveston, which was close to where my daughter lived so that she could kind of look after me.

20:10.655 --> 20:13.561
So I was put in the psychiatric ward down there.

20:13.581 --> 20:19.995
And it was tough because you were actually locked up, really.

20:19.975 --> 20:23.179
And they tried all kinds of medications.

20:23.320 --> 20:38.220
I was in and out of the hospital and they tried all different kinds of medications and they didn't seem to work and finally she had to go to court to allow them to use ECTs which is electric shock treatment.

20:40.495 --> 20:45.702
I had six of those, and I got discharged from the hospital, and I was doing really well.

20:46.062 --> 20:53.352
So I came back to Grimes County, and I was okay, but I stayed there too long by myself, and I relapsed.

20:53.372 --> 20:57.958
I went back down to UTMB, and I had six more treatments.

20:58.338 --> 21:04.907
And at the end of those, the doctor said, Dick, we can do one of three things for you.

21:04.927 --> 21:09.152
We can give you some medication like Prozac or

21:09.773 --> 21:10.976
Zoloft or Paxil.

21:10.996 --> 21:12.981
I don't know how I've already had all of those things.

21:13.001 --> 21:13.643
They didn't help.

21:14.424 --> 21:20.339
Or you can come down here once a month and have one of these other treatments, or we can do nothing.

21:20.981 --> 21:23.226
I said, well, I really don't want to do anything.

21:23.527 --> 21:32.600
So I was staying with my daughter at the time and the flight museum was having an open house, the One Star Flight Museum in Galveston.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.162
So I went over and I joined.

21:34.182 --> 21:36.505
Well, I was always interested in aviation.

21:36.625 --> 21:41.572
Here's all these World War II airplanes and it was just, it was wonderful for me.

21:41.592 --> 21:52.487
And so while I was staying with her, I would go over there to the museum and work all day long with the curators and

21:53.598 --> 22:03.928
Made a lot of good friends there and I stayed there until I joined about January of

22:04.162 --> 22:32.886
98 and it wasn't too long after that that I was able to come home and I was okay but I would go down there and stay with her and go to museums and I would work air shows and finally they asked me after I'd had so many hours did I you know well I would I like to go to an air show well you bet so I remember this very well my first air show was at Burnett Texas and my brother lived out there

22:32.967 --> 22:38.636
And I called him on the phone and I said, Chuck, I said, I am going to come over there for Easter.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.298
Oh, well, that's good, good.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.241
Yeah, but I'm coming in the B-17.

22:43.463 --> 22:48.811
And so we flew over to Burnett in the B-17.

22:49.272 --> 22:54.780
And I had made some other... One of the air shows we went to, I think, was San Marcos.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.765
I flew over in the B-17 and flew back in the B-25.

22:59.527 --> 23:01.270
But the best...

23:01.570 --> 23:09.741
Biggest memory was we were going to an air show in Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina.

23:10.261 --> 23:19.077
And we're about halfway over there and I'd been all over the airplane sitting in the bombardier seat and the gunners and the navigators and all those seats.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.321
But I never sat in the left seat.

23:21.521 --> 23:24.126
And one of the guys said, have you ever sat in the left seat?

23:24.747 --> 23:25.128
No.

23:25.608 --> 23:26.510
Well, get up here.

23:26.991 --> 23:33.282
So for about 30 minutes, they let me keep that B-17 on course and level.

23:33.262 --> 23:35.844
And that's probably the highlight of my life.

23:36.785 --> 23:38.587
You did get to be a pilot.

23:39.247 --> 23:40.288
You did get to be a pilot.

23:40.308 --> 23:41.470
You mentioned your brother, Chuck.

23:42.691 --> 23:44.252
You said he's my famous brother.

23:45.013 --> 23:49.497
Talk about Chuck and the very important job he had in a very important part of our history.

23:49.997 --> 23:51.999
My brother, Chuck, worked for NASA.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.321
He's 10 years younger than I am.

23:54.341 --> 23:57.925
And he was the retro fire officer on Apollo 13.

23:58.345 --> 24:01.648
He was on Gene Kranz's team.

24:01.882 --> 24:06.847
And his main job was to see that those guys came back.

24:07.067 --> 24:12.171
And of course, if everybody's seen the movie, the movie was pretty accurate.

24:13.032 --> 24:17.256
And he consulted with them when they made the movie, as a matter of fact.

24:18.077 --> 24:19.278
With Ron Howard, the director.

24:19.398 --> 24:23.542
Ron Howard, the director, and Tom Hanks.

24:23.822 --> 24:29.307
And he knows, he's spoken a lot, he knows all those astronauts.

24:30.164 --> 24:34.851
It was his job to figure out where they needed to land in the Pacific.

24:34.871 --> 24:40.040
And some of them wanted to change where they wanted to land, but he was pretty insistent that they stay where they did.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.742
As it turned out, that was fine.

24:41.802 --> 24:45.809
The landing, everybody knows now that they got them back home and everything.

24:46.350 --> 24:50.656
But the alternate landing site, there actually was a typhoon where they wanted to change it to.

24:50.776 --> 24:56.205
So his insistence that they don't change their plans really worked out well.

24:56.793 --> 24:57.494
Indeed.

24:57.514 --> 25:00.838
I think you said later there was a TV movie called Houston We Have a Problem.

25:00.858 --> 25:04.002
Yeah, there was a TV movie called Houston We Have a Problem.

25:04.082 --> 25:05.504
It was about Apollo 13.

25:06.045 --> 25:09.729
And in that movie, Robert Culp played my brother.

25:09.950 --> 25:10.270
I see.

25:10.851 --> 25:12.213
I see.

25:12.233 --> 25:13.254
You've got to be very proud of him.

25:13.735 --> 25:14.395
Yes, I am.

25:14.435 --> 25:16.418
He's quite a guy.

25:16.538 --> 25:18.420
And he works for Blue Origin?

25:18.821 --> 25:23.347
Now he works for Jeff Bezos, who has this project called Blue Origin.

25:23.367 --> 25:25.129
And that's a...

25:26.138 --> 25:55.993
civilian rocket program to take people into space they have a launching place out in west texas i don't know thousands of acres i think they've got he has out there right as wonderful as the the flight museum did for you and did for your life and and turned around and everything like that uh in 2003 uh you met a lady who uh obviously has really changed your your life talk about wanda well i was pretty active with the republican

25:56.463 --> 25:58.085
in Grimes County.

25:58.145 --> 26:03.732
I was precinct chair, and they had a meeting in Bryan, Senate District 5 meeting.

26:04.573 --> 26:13.284
And the Brazos Valley Christian Singles had a, they were having a bunco party at Otto's Bakery.

26:13.304 --> 26:16.508
And so we would have a meal there and then play bunco.

26:16.528 --> 26:20.112
And after the meeting, there was still time.

26:20.192 --> 26:22.555
I went to the movies, and then I went over to Otto's Bakery.

26:23.556 --> 26:25.018
Well, we were playing...

26:26.146 --> 26:51.681
bunko i i threw a bunko and wanda's hand got on it first and i put my hand on top of hers and she kind of looked at me and and it was love well she gave me she gave me her email and we emailed back and forth for quite a while and then she finally invited she decided well we had a lot in common so she invited me over for uh roast beef and uh

26:52.066 --> 26:56.314
pot roast and to watch professional football.

26:56.334 --> 26:59.599
And we married then in June of 2004.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.082
At Disney World.

27:01.102 --> 27:01.823
At Disney World.

27:01.843 --> 27:03.526
At Disney World with Mickey Mouse ears.

27:03.687 --> 27:06.772
Yeah.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.940
A funny part about that is I'm standing out of a restroom, outside a restroom.

27:10.960 --> 27:15.728
I got this hat on with the ears and I'm holding the bouquet.

27:16.315 --> 27:18.158
You didn't give us that picture.

27:18.779 --> 27:21.042
There wasn't a picture, I don't think.

27:22.143 --> 27:22.864
We're out of time.

27:23.025 --> 27:25.889
But thank you very much for your service and a great story.

27:25.969 --> 27:28.713
And thank you for the help that you've given people through your own battles.

27:28.813 --> 27:29.454
I appreciate it.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.597
I hope it helps somebody.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.017
Indeed.

27:32.077 --> 27:33.299
Thank you for your service.

27:33.319 --> 27:38.266
Dick Deiterich's service never took him so far from home as even west of the Mississippi.

27:38.286 --> 27:42.272
But it was time proudly served and essential to our cause of freedom.

27:42.573 --> 27:48.340
He speaks freely of his personal battles and how it was volunteerism that helped him win those battles.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.283
So we salute Dick Deiterich for his service to the U.S.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.788
Army and wish him and Wanda years of deserved happiness to come.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.730
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.750
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
