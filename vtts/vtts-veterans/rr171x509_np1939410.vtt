00:06.140 --> 00:30.477
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.283 --> 00:37.552
Rich Thomas of College Station will talk about the destroyer USS Leonard F. Mason as if it's a family member.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.175
And why not?

00:39.195 --> 00:45.544
It was his home for four years during his service as a Navy sailor during the Korean War.

00:45.564 --> 00:47.668
He found the fast track to combat for sure.

00:47.808 --> 00:57.983
Just three months after joining the Navy at age 17, the USS Mason was on the receiving end of a Korean offensive off the eastern shore of the country at Wonton Harbor.

00:58.486 --> 01:00.609
It was a quick introduction to war.

01:00.629 --> 01:04.954
He knows that he was luckier than many others to have survived the conflict.

01:04.974 --> 01:09.439
We are glad that he did, and we are proud to welcome Rich Thomas to Veterans of the Valley.

01:10.180 --> 01:13.725
Rich, it is indeed a pleasure to have you here, and thank you again for your service.

01:13.745 --> 01:16.128
Let's go back to what we were just talking about.

01:16.148 --> 01:26.400
It was 1951 that you signed up in the Navy and won too long, a little bit of training, and you were off the shore in Korea, and you had fire coming at you.

01:26.718 --> 01:31.927
Sort of look back that many years ago, and what were you thinking back then?

01:31.947 --> 01:35.153
I was thinking the quickest way of getting out of the line of fire.

01:38.258 --> 01:47.595
At the time, the Navy rushed a bunch of young men onto these ships to fill out a wartime crew, and I happened to be one of them.

01:48.098 --> 02:01.372
And when I went into Wonson Harbor, I'd been aboard ship three days, and I went into Wonson Harbor, and they opened up on us.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.355
And I didn't even have a battle station.

02:03.755 --> 02:11.223
And I was scared to death, and I saw all these men running for this little hatch going up to their battle stations.

02:12.104 --> 02:14.747
And I waited until they all got up, and I followed

02:15.166 --> 02:22.621
through that little hole and the chief asked me where my battle station was and I said, I don't have one, sir.

02:22.641 --> 02:23.623
And he said, follow me.

02:23.643 --> 02:30.878
And he shoved me into this little round room underneath the turret and said, get against the wall and stay out of the way.

02:30.978 --> 02:35.267
And that's my first experience with the enemy.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.458
So when the shelling started, you were in your rack down below, right?

02:38.478 --> 02:53.560
Yes, I was in my rack, and I studied these guys for a while going up this ladder, and they were running full bore, and I thought, well, this is not for me down here by myself, so I went up that hole with them.

02:54.080 --> 03:03.134
When the Korean War broke out, I know that a lot of the armed services were depleted at the time because after World War II, a lot of the services had really cut back.

03:03.735 --> 03:10.025
So that's sort of the way the Korean War started, having to rebuild troop and troop enforcement.

03:10.446 --> 03:13.471
Talk a little bit about what the job of the mason was.

03:13.511 --> 03:21.724
You were off the shore of Korea, the eastern shore of Korea, and it was near a Korean railway station, and part of your job was to knock that out, right?

03:21.923 --> 03:23.025
Yes.

03:23.887 --> 03:24.850
Shore bombarding.

03:25.732 --> 03:33.268
And Wonsan Harbor happened to be just a hot spot because it was the biggest railroad depot in Korea.

03:34.211 --> 03:37.097
And we had to stay in the harbor 24 hours a day.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.765
and firing 24 hours a day.

03:40.066 --> 03:42.029
Around the clock we kept firing.

03:42.650 --> 03:49.701
And we had all kinds of stations up the coast of Korea.

03:50.762 --> 03:56.912
And these were generally small railroad stations going up through there.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.575
And we were in charge of knocking them out.

03:59.736 --> 04:01.840
And we did a pretty good job of it.

04:02.581 --> 04:05.886
The mason was a tough little tin can.

04:06.254 --> 04:18.289
I read on the internet about the Mason, said on May the 16th, 1951, what they called the Siege of Wonsan Harbor and the ship received a Korean service medal for what happened that particular day.

04:18.329 --> 04:22.394
I guess you were on the boat that time and sort of talk about that.

04:22.454 --> 04:26.659
Was that what we were talking about three months after you got there or was that later on?

04:27.020 --> 04:29.022
Well, we were in there quite a

04:29.440 --> 04:33.746
quite a number of times, but that particular time was the three months after I was in.

04:34.767 --> 04:39.013
We just got into the harbor and they opened up on us.

04:39.634 --> 04:45.742
They put some shrapnel on the side of us and they just weren't quite the shot that we were.

04:46.062 --> 04:52.150
We would fire at them and they would run back into these caves.

04:52.311 --> 04:56.376
They would come out for a while and fire 15, 20 rounds and then go back in.

04:56.828 --> 04:58.230
It was kind of hard to get to them.

04:59.171 --> 05:02.296
We had short notice to where it was coming from.

05:03.137 --> 05:10.908
Once you finally got a battle station, I know your first job you told me about was one that you had to try to sleep around powder kegs, sleep on powder kegs.

05:10.928 --> 05:11.308
Talk about that.

05:11.328 --> 05:12.710
That wasn't the greatest job on the ship.

05:14.072 --> 05:17.737
No, it was kind of funny too, but it wasn't funny.

05:17.757 --> 05:19.680
They told me I was assigned to the powder room.

05:20.200 --> 05:47.507
I said where's the powder room and they said it's down in the bottom of the ship and so they said get you a life jacket and go down there and I went down there and there was two guys stand watching at the same time and this other guy was laying up on a powder keg sleeping and without his life jacket he was using it as a pillow and I said his name was Summer Don I said Don you know you should get your life jacket on he said Richard

05:48.331 --> 05:52.155
It's not going to do you a bit of good if they hit this powder room.

05:52.676 --> 05:54.718
It won't mean no life jackets.

05:54.738 --> 05:55.999
It won't mean that's nothing left.

05:57.220 --> 05:57.380
No.

05:57.661 --> 06:03.647
But you were on four-hour shifts, so somehow you had to find out a way to get some sleep while sleeping on these powder cakes, right?

06:03.667 --> 06:04.328
Yeah, we did.

06:04.568 --> 06:05.249
We did sleep.

06:05.309 --> 06:08.212
Eat or sleep or read books.

06:08.232 --> 06:09.293
There wasn't anything to do.

06:09.733 --> 06:15.319
Well, there was, too, when we were firing 24 hours a day.

06:15.339 --> 06:17.882
You had to slap one in there every night.

06:18.622 --> 06:28.717
The powder, you have a powder keg like this and they throw that in the turret and then they put the shell in the front of it.

06:28.737 --> 06:31.281
There's two pieces to this when you fire a shell.

06:32.022 --> 06:35.668
And they got an elevator going up.

06:36.155 --> 06:42.221
That was my job, throwing these powder kegs in that elevator.

06:42.241 --> 06:43.563
Eventually you got to change jobs.

06:43.583 --> 06:48.808
You got to go to the main director, which you felt was a safer place because of the armament there, I know.

06:48.848 --> 06:53.593
But you were a fire control technician for three years, your last three years on the Mason.

06:53.633 --> 06:56.096
Talk about that job and what that involved.

06:56.857 --> 06:59.359
Well, it controlled.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.664
It's just exactly what it says, the fire control technician.

07:04.353 --> 07:09.358
you can lock on all the guns to a target.

07:10.599 --> 07:17.726
Like say we were in the harbors, and they opened fire, we could see the flash of their guns, and that's how we would jeep row in.

07:17.746 --> 07:24.032
And on the main director, I was a pointer, and we would try to get onto the target.

07:24.052 --> 07:31.339
As soon as we got on it, we hit a button, and all the guns locked onto that particular target, and we could open fire with every gun on the ship.

07:32.095 --> 07:36.361
And that's basically what a fire control technician did.

07:37.062 --> 07:39.185
What kind of armament was on the mason?

07:39.265 --> 07:40.767
What kind of guns were there?

07:41.107 --> 07:41.488
Tin.

07:43.491 --> 07:44.652
That's why they call them tin cans.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.595
There's not much armor.

07:46.615 --> 07:50.300
The only place that they had a lot of armor was the main director.

07:50.320 --> 07:57.910
And I started thinking a little bit, and I said, where is the safest place on this ship?

07:57.930 --> 08:01.275
And they said, I think the main director, because it's got about a foot of armor.

08:01.694 --> 08:07.666
So I finagled my way up to the top and got up there and directed it.

08:07.686 --> 08:13.719
But there wasn't too many safe spots on a destroyer because they're not real strongly built.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.228
But it was a destroyer, and as a destroyer, its main job was to take out other targets.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.513
So there were a lot of guns on this ship, weren't there?

08:20.915 --> 08:44.323
There were three twin fives, which is 105 millimeter, I believe, and there were two twin threes and two single threes, four torpedo mounts, or tubes, and we had depth charges on both sides of the ship that could sling the depth charges out to the sides.

08:44.422 --> 08:47.346
There was two racks on the back where we could roll them off the back.

08:48.348 --> 08:59.304
And we had what they call little missiles up on the hedgehogs.

08:59.985 --> 09:01.266
They had two hedgehog racks.

09:01.286 --> 09:03.850
They had 15 hedgehogs on each rack, on each side.

09:04.551 --> 09:06.514
And they were probably the best

09:06.983 --> 09:11.830
anti-submarine gun we had.

09:13.152 --> 09:28.193
We could pick up a submarine and we knew exactly where it was and we could lock on and fire and those 15 rockets would go out there and spread out and we had them set right where the submarine was.

09:28.213 --> 09:34.442
We could set them the depth of it and those things would go down and explode and it was a goodbye submarine.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.084
The destroyers, submarines don't like destroyers.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.146
I'll bet not.

09:39.206 --> 09:40.789
They don't like them at all.

09:40.809 --> 09:45.879
Now, the fleet that you were a part of in the Wonsan Harbor, it was a large fleet.

09:45.919 --> 09:51.088
I think you said it was, the fleet was number 77, is that right?

09:51.329 --> 09:52.170
Task Force 77.

09:52.210 --> 09:53.252
Task Force 77.

09:53.673 --> 09:54.675
Talk about

09:54.824 --> 10:01.418
about how many carriers, how many battleships, about what was the makeup of the task force?

10:02.460 --> 10:06.829
Most of the time, Tom, there would be two to three carriers.

10:08.493 --> 10:15.668
Just an example, we had the Boxer, the Field C, they were not big carriers.

10:16.053 --> 10:19.857
like they have today, but they were the biggest we had.

10:21.580 --> 10:33.654
Most of the time we had a battleship, the Missouri, Jersey, the Iowa, and we'd have two cruisers and probably three squadrons of destroyers.

10:34.515 --> 10:37.398
You always had to have those destroyers to protect the carriers.

10:39.341 --> 10:41.924
It's pretty hard to get through 12 destroyers.

10:41.944 --> 10:45.688
You mentioned the Missouri, so this was the same ship that obviously gained fame as

10:46.141 --> 10:50.926
the surrender of Japan being signed on that deck at the end of World War II.

10:51.447 --> 10:54.229
It obviously kept in service and kept in service in Korea.

10:54.269 --> 10:55.991
So that's the ship you're talking about.

10:56.091 --> 10:57.873
It was at times part of your fleet.

10:58.694 --> 10:59.315
Indeed.

10:59.335 --> 10:59.575
Indeed.

11:00.015 --> 11:02.218
I noticed that the Mason also had some nicknames.

11:02.458 --> 11:07.263
Leakey Leonard, Racin Mason, or a couple of the things that you called it, right?

11:09.325 --> 11:09.425
Yeah.

11:09.445 --> 11:15.051
Probably the reason they called it the Racin Mason is because I think there was about four or five destroyers that

11:15.605 --> 11:19.951
They were racing to pick up the astronauts when they dumped them from the Pacific.

11:20.011 --> 11:22.434
Put a mason out around them and he got there first.

11:22.454 --> 11:28.322
This is a good time to talk about that, although it happened after you had already left the service.

11:28.342 --> 11:39.117
In 1966, this same ship, the same destroyer, the USS Mason, was involved in a rescue of astronaut Neil Armstrong and David Scott from Gemini 8.

11:39.617 --> 11:43.182
I was able to learn that after they had an emergency.

11:43.381 --> 11:47.605
at the end of their space flight and had to end it early and go into the ocean quickly.

11:47.645 --> 11:51.649
And it was the Mason was the first one that came along and picked up the capsule.

11:52.470 --> 11:53.952
So it gained some fame there.

11:53.972 --> 11:59.417
And as a matter of fact, later on, we've got a photograph of that capsule coming up on the USS Mason.

11:59.798 --> 12:03.962
I noticed, I don't want to go further without telling people who Leonard F. Mason was.

12:04.462 --> 12:08.967
I read that he was a PFC who died in Guam during World War II, and he was a

12:09.368 --> 12:15.535
a young soldier who gave his life in World War II, and that's who the destroyer was named after.

12:15.555 --> 12:16.275
He was named after.

12:16.816 --> 12:20.019
See, destroyers, Tom, are named after Medal of Honor winners.

12:20.119 --> 12:20.520
Right.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.140
Most of them.

12:21.241 --> 12:31.011
And Leonard, his family located the captain that was in the foxhole with him the day he received his heroism.

12:32.272 --> 12:38.599
He was under orders not to get out of the foxhole, and he had his left arm just about blown off.

12:39.541 --> 12:45.910
And I think his leg and his stomach and the stock of his gun was blown off.

12:46.851 --> 12:52.319
And the captain gave him orders to stay in the foxhole and he said, no, we're losing too many men.

12:52.720 --> 12:58.548
And he charged the Japanese foxhole and wiped them out single-handedly.

12:59.028 --> 13:03.034
What a brave servant of his country.

13:03.098 --> 13:04.279
He kind of, too.

13:04.519 --> 13:06.822
He's from my home state of Kentucky.

13:07.122 --> 13:08.183
I was kind of proud of that.

13:08.203 --> 13:08.804
I bet you were.

13:09.044 --> 13:09.545
I bet you were.

13:09.945 --> 13:10.946
Speaking of, let's go back.

13:11.226 --> 13:13.829
Let's backtrack to Rich Thomas' life.

13:13.849 --> 13:17.873
You grew up in Uniontown, Kentucky, and quite a large family.

13:17.893 --> 13:19.014
You had 11 siblings.

13:19.034 --> 13:23.539
There were 12 kids in all, and I think you said you were the youngest of the sons, right?

13:23.779 --> 13:24.039
Right.

13:25.421 --> 13:28.684
Yeah, and I'm most proud that we were all veterans.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.866
There was three in World War II and three in Korea.

13:35.869 --> 13:36.530
That's okay.

13:37.751 --> 13:38.392
We'll just turn that off.

13:38.412 --> 13:39.233
I always do that.

13:39.273 --> 13:39.854
That's fine.

13:39.914 --> 13:41.156
Don't worry about it.

13:41.176 --> 13:41.396
Keep going.

13:41.416 --> 13:51.330
And my oldest brother, he went on Omaha Beach and he went all the way across Germington and up to the Battle of the Bulge with General Patton's tanks.

13:51.462 --> 13:57.029
And my second oldest brother, he had the USS Princeton shot up under him.

13:57.049 --> 14:00.353
And he was able to get off, but there was a little story.

14:01.093 --> 14:02.535
If we've got time, I'll tell you.

14:02.555 --> 14:03.116
Sure, go ahead.

14:03.136 --> 14:06.019
He was running across the flight deck and it was burning and smoking.

14:06.039 --> 14:07.421
He said he couldn't see where he was going.

14:08.242 --> 14:11.225
And he was going to jump in the water because they were going down.

14:12.086 --> 14:16.071
And the kid behind him yelled, he couldn't swim.

14:16.091 --> 14:16.812
And so...

14:16.960 --> 14:18.571
I get tears in my eyes when I talk about it.

14:18.591 --> 14:23.123
My brother took his life jacket off and gave it to him.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.722
Jumped in the water by himself.

14:25.742 --> 14:26.804
You certainly should be proud.

14:26.924 --> 14:33.013
I know you told me a story just the other day about how it's always a snapshot in your mind of when your brother came home.

14:33.474 --> 14:43.248
But you're proud of all your siblings, your brothers and your sisters, and all of them were veterans, three of them in World War II and three, like yourself, that served in Korea.

14:43.268 --> 14:48.055
And, of course, your brother and all of your siblings except the brother that you mentioned.

14:48.075 --> 14:48.696
What was his name?

14:48.716 --> 14:49.117
I'm sorry.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.881
The one that was on the Princeton, Leonard.

14:52.101 --> 14:52.502
Leonard.

14:52.482 --> 15:02.295
All of your siblings except for Leonard are still alive and he died in an accident so a lot of longevity in the Thomas family.

15:02.355 --> 15:16.093
Your parents were farmers in Kentucky and you celebrated your 18th birthday I know before just getting to Korea, had about nine weeks of basic training and then you were there.

15:16.495 --> 15:20.379
You were a young guy really sort of learning about life quite early, weren't you?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.101
I sure was.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.825
It made a man I'm quicker than I wanted to be, I think.

15:26.686 --> 15:27.647
Indeed.

15:28.268 --> 15:38.139
We've got some pictures, some pictures that you gave to me, some pictures that I was able to get off the amazing Internet when I went and learned more about the USS Leonard F. Mason.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.782
We can go to some of those pictures now.

15:40.882 --> 15:41.963
We'll take a look at them.

15:42.567 --> 15:47.594
Matter of fact, you can look right there on the monitor, and that is a picture of the mason.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.637
Talk a little bit about the ship and sort of what we're looking at.

15:50.959 --> 15:56.587
Well, it was 300 and some feet long and had a crew of 325 men.

15:57.088 --> 16:04.859
And you can see the two twin fives in front and the hedgehogs right behind it.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.503
And then there was another twin five in the back.

16:08.945 --> 16:12.270
And there's twin threes up at a bridge.

16:12.503 --> 16:16.930
And you can see that little house right below the mast there.

16:16.950 --> 16:18.293
That was my battle station.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.657
That was the main director.

16:20.677 --> 16:22.880
That's where I spent a lot of time.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.065
We stood four on eight off around a clock for four years.

16:27.127 --> 16:28.950
852 was the number on the hall.

16:29.912 --> 16:30.613
Right there.

16:31.302 --> 16:33.187
That's quite a ship, no doubt about it.

16:33.669 --> 16:38.623
Now this is a picture that I found on the internet, just an amazing picture.

16:38.643 --> 16:43.337
And if people will look closely, that was obviously taken from another ship in your fleet, I guess.

16:43.739 --> 16:46.123
And this was taken in May of 1951.

16:46.804 --> 16:49.808
So you are on the Mason time this picture was taken.

16:50.108 --> 16:57.519
As you can see, the rough seas of the Wonsan Harbor there in the background is the shore, the eastern shore of the country of Korea.

16:57.539 --> 17:03.368
And if you look very closely right there in the middle of the picture, that's the USS Leonard F. Mason.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.081
As you look at that picture, sort of what are we looking at?

17:07.262 --> 17:12.048
We get an idea of how close you were to the shore and how close the shore was to you also.

17:12.068 --> 17:15.433
So that could have been some quite fierce battles there, right?

17:15.473 --> 17:17.276
Yeah, we went in very close.

17:17.636 --> 17:23.424
And that little hill there is where most of the artillery came from.

17:24.426 --> 17:27.550
And that was a dangerous spot right there.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.295
I had one quick story I was going to tell you.

17:29.856 --> 17:31.459
We got a call one day.

17:31.499 --> 17:33.402
We were under fire and we got a call for some help.

17:34.123 --> 17:42.035
And the ship that was out of sight, one of the big cruisers, it was my brother's ship.

17:42.315 --> 17:43.437
He was on at the same time.

17:43.718 --> 17:46.602
And so he kind of got us out of a bind that day.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.726
You were able to find him again.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.088
My brother Pat, yes.

17:50.108 --> 17:52.372
Right, your brother Pat, one of the veterans.

17:52.893 --> 17:54.356
Okay, let's move on.

17:54.376 --> 17:57.461
I believe we've got... Now, this is the picture we promised you.

17:57.521 --> 18:00.987
This was so long after, of course, your service, but I wanted to include this.

18:01.027 --> 18:09.923
We just told the story about in 1966, Gemini 8, the capsule, had an emergency landing after a problem that they had in space.

18:10.325 --> 18:23.005
and Neil Armstrong, who eventually, of course, would be the first man to step on the moon, and astronaut Scott were in the capsule, and the first ship to come alongside was the Mason, where you had served for four years.

18:23.025 --> 18:27.051
And this is a picture of the capsule actually being lifted up onto the deck of the Mason.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.438
So that's one of the claims to fame of the Masons.

18:30.638 --> 18:32.701
Yeah, there's a story there two times.

18:32.761 --> 18:37.189
Leonard F. Mason's mother and Neil Armstrong's mother were friends.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.010
Wow.

18:38.251 --> 18:42.939
They lived a few blocks apart before this even came about.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.421
Incredible.

18:44.882 --> 18:45.343
Incredible.

18:46.364 --> 18:47.446
Okay, let's move on.

18:47.506 --> 18:49.109
I think we've got the final picture.

18:49.149 --> 18:50.271
There's a handsome...

18:50.605 --> 18:51.286
Young sailor.

18:52.107 --> 18:53.108
How old do you think you were?

18:53.128 --> 18:55.451
You think you were about 18 or 19 when that picture was taken?

18:55.612 --> 18:57.694
I was 18, I believe.

18:58.255 --> 18:59.256
18 years old.

18:59.296 --> 19:01.900
When that picture was taken, yeah.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.124
So you were already on the Mason by then?

19:05.144 --> 19:12.374
Yeah, I'd been across, I'd been over to Korea, and we were kind of in the middle of a transfer back to the States.

19:12.394 --> 19:17.761
So I was on there two months, and then we came back to the States, and that's when I took that picture.

19:18.902 --> 19:19.162
Right.

19:19.483 --> 19:19.583
Yeah.

19:20.002 --> 19:23.466
Well, thank you for those pictures and thanks to the internet because the internet is amazing.

19:23.526 --> 19:28.090
I was able to come up with those pictures and learn so much more about the Leonard F. Mason.

19:28.110 --> 19:39.883
You told a story about how there was some discomfort in eating sometimes on the Mason because you'd get in the chow line and the Koreans were able to get a pretty good look at you there, right?

19:39.903 --> 19:41.664
Yeah, we kind of figured it out.

19:41.724 --> 19:45.148
I think we started getting the chow line down below deck.

19:45.702 --> 19:50.173
But every day at noon, it seemed like we were pretty hungry guys.

19:50.855 --> 19:52.900
We didn't get a chance to eat because they'd open up on us.

19:53.521 --> 19:55.867
And we were so close in that they could see us.

19:56.689 --> 19:57.972
And the captain figured that out.

19:58.012 --> 19:59.155
He said, you guys are going to have to see.

19:59.422 --> 20:01.044
getting the shot line downstairs.

20:01.064 --> 20:01.945
Somebody's going to get hurt.

20:03.588 --> 20:03.928
Indeed.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.393
The Mason itself was a fairly fortunate ship.

20:07.413 --> 20:08.514
It took some shrapnel.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.976
It took some hits.

20:10.096 --> 20:14.522
Nothing real serious or no casualties, at least while you were there.

20:15.604 --> 20:18.668
But all the ships in the fleet certainly weren't that lucky.

20:18.688 --> 20:21.232
Your ship was luckier than most, right?

20:21.252 --> 20:23.875
We had one to relieve us one time.

20:23.895 --> 20:26.178
We were up pretty close to the Russian border.

20:26.198 --> 20:28.922
And we had already knocked out a train that day.

20:29.442 --> 20:34.449
And it was our time to go in for a little hour and hour, so another ship took our place.

20:34.910 --> 20:44.664
And a couple days later, we were going to Wansan, I mean, Sasibo, Japan, for a little hour and hour, and we got an emergency call back down, Mason.

20:45.646 --> 20:55.520
Got an emergency, and it was a ship that took our place, and they had 13 deaths, and both stacks blown off, and they were pretty well shot up.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.643
That was a ship that took our place, so.

20:57.978 --> 20:59.260
We were pretty lucky again.

21:00.361 --> 21:00.641
Indeed.

21:02.544 --> 21:07.310
Your job wasn't just to fire upon the railroad tracks and to take those out.

21:07.350 --> 21:14.639
I know that you also provided cover for air cover, I believe, and carrier cover, and you also had that job too.

21:14.939 --> 21:22.669
Yeah, shore bombarding and patrolling the Formosa Straits.

21:24.083 --> 21:30.627
And the plane guard, we did a lot of plane guard work behind the carriers.

21:32.193 --> 21:34.802
And, oh gosh.

21:35.609 --> 21:41.195
I know you'd pick up pilots out of the water, some who were disabled, some who had lost their lives.

21:41.215 --> 21:51.587
You picked up those other airmen and sailors and Navy pilots and all that that had been shot down.

21:51.647 --> 21:56.032
So it was sort of a multi-task ship, the Mason, right?

21:56.333 --> 22:00.317
Yes, it was.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.976
I can't think of what all we had to do.

22:03.537 --> 22:08.062
A lot of times we would stay offshore when these Navy planes were bombing.

22:08.803 --> 22:13.790
If they got hit, they knew that we would be out there and they could sit down right next to us.

22:13.990 --> 22:16.693
And we picked up three young men like that.

22:17.454 --> 22:25.505
But the main story I could tell you is I was watching three planes coming in one day with my binoculars and one of them was smoking.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.128
And it looked like something's wrong.

22:28.528 --> 22:29.730
And all of a sudden,

22:30.335 --> 22:31.997
He turned and came right toward us.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.599
Of course, it scared me to death.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.184
I yelled at the officer today that we were being attacked.

22:37.545 --> 22:38.426
I scared him too.

22:38.586 --> 22:46.497
The kid stuck with that plane until he almost hit the water and then he bailed out.

22:46.998 --> 22:47.919
His chute didn't open.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.221
He lost his life.

22:49.876 --> 22:50.236
Wow.

22:50.757 --> 22:53.700
That has to be something that you certainly remember.

22:54.141 --> 22:54.701
Oh, yeah.

22:54.721 --> 23:01.188
I'm going to lighten it up because I'm going to get you to retell a story that you told me about one day when you all had gone to the Midway to refuel.

23:01.869 --> 23:03.731
You need to tell me about your high diving act.

23:04.452 --> 23:04.872
Go ahead.

23:05.192 --> 23:05.973
The stage is yours.

23:06.013 --> 23:06.294
Tell us.

23:06.314 --> 23:07.555
Doc Cooper will love this.

23:09.277 --> 23:11.479
We had been over with the Marine Corps.

23:11.499 --> 23:18.106
We'd go on to refuel on the way over in Midway Island, and we'd go and reminisce with the Marine Corps.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.748
They had a bunch of Marines on there.

23:20.420 --> 23:23.526
And we'd go over and drink a little iced tea and coke with them.

23:23.546 --> 23:28.835
And just one day, I think me and a couple of friends of mine got a little too much coke.

23:28.855 --> 23:34.646
And when I got back to the ship, I went up on the bridge and we were up looking around.

23:34.666 --> 23:38.032
And I decided to do a famous swan dive.

23:38.112 --> 23:41.618
And I used to pull on the banks of the Ohio River in Kentucky.

23:42.425 --> 23:44.968
And they dared me to do it, and over I went.

23:45.128 --> 23:47.992
And why I'm here today, I don't know, Tom.

23:49.254 --> 23:51.557
I didn't think I would ever hit the water, but I did.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.299
It was a beautiful dive.

23:53.319 --> 23:54.260
It was a beautiful dive?

23:54.280 --> 24:00.949
I saluted the officer today when I went by the quarterdeck, so he wasn't too happy about that.

24:00.969 --> 24:04.393
You just had a little too much lemonade, and you were just celebrating, right?

24:04.413 --> 24:05.915
It was all the Marines' fault.

24:05.935 --> 24:08.078
They got us in trouble.

24:08.783 --> 24:16.093
Last January, you and your wife Marguerite celebrated your 50th wedding anniversary, and you have two sons, Bill and Mike.

24:16.495 --> 24:22.120
Why don't you talk about Marguerite and how you met Marguerite and about that poor soul Jack Hayes.

24:23.221 --> 24:27.305
We don't know exactly where Jack is now, but all we know is that he's probably still mad at you.

24:27.325 --> 24:28.686
Talk about how you met Marguerite.

24:29.247 --> 24:33.651
Well, I was on the foc's little ship when they were tied up in Long Beach, California.

24:33.831 --> 24:45.962
And I was up there sunning and I looked down the pier and here comes this friend of mine that was a shipmate walking down the pier with this beautiful blonde.

24:46.634 --> 24:49.237
My gosh, where did that guy find her?

24:49.257 --> 24:59.188
And he brought her up on the photo where I was up there sunning, and he made the mistake of going down and getting a cup of coffee, and he told me to talk to her while he was down there.

24:59.328 --> 25:04.734
So I did some fast talking, and that was 50-some years ago, and I'm still talking fast.

25:06.977 --> 25:14.245
But she's been a wonderful, couldn't ask for a better woman, and God bless Leonard Alpha Mason because they introduced us.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.092
Absolutely.

25:15.673 --> 25:21.526
And she spent her career, her working career, working for the Social Security Administration, I believe you told me.

25:21.546 --> 25:22.749
30 years, is that right?

25:22.769 --> 25:25.375
She had 38 years with the government.

25:25.395 --> 25:29.685
She worked with the Navy Department for a while in Long Beach.

25:29.665 --> 25:33.292
and the VA and then she went to Social Security and spent a lot of time there.

25:34.935 --> 25:36.238
I got to keep her busy, Tom.

25:36.278 --> 25:36.879
I had to eat.

25:37.961 --> 25:39.124
I'm very proud of your service.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.466
You got out of the Navy.

25:40.526 --> 25:44.655
You were in Chicago, I believe, and you were in Chicago.

25:44.695 --> 25:48.683
You were in the printing business for a while, but then talk about what happened after that.

25:48.703 --> 25:51.488
You changed careers and that's what brought you to Texas.

25:51.873 --> 26:16.193
Yeah, this friend of mine had an uncle that bought a big estate, and they needed some boys to take care of the estate, and I was tired of the printing business, and he knew that I was kind of a farmer, and I guess he thought I could plant flowers and stuff, and he talked me into going with him, and he was a grain broker at the Board of Trade,

26:16.797 --> 26:23.730
And he, shortly after I went out there to take care of his estate, he decided to sell it and buy an oil company in Texas.

26:24.712 --> 26:28.820
And he asked me if I wanted to come to Texas and help him run his oil company.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.447
So it was called Casco Oil out in Iola, Texas.

26:33.148 --> 26:34.932
And so that's how I got down here.

26:35.312 --> 26:37.236
He brought me down here with the oil business.

26:37.992 --> 26:40.441
And you've been here some 30 years now.

26:40.983 --> 26:42.449
Yeah, we love College Station.

26:42.489 --> 26:47.648
Brian put it up with the Aggies and all that.

26:48.050 --> 26:51.154
And I know that you're a member of the VFW.

26:51.274 --> 26:59.444
You're an honor guard, part of the honor guard with Post 4692, and I know that you're very proud of that and proud of all your service.

26:59.464 --> 27:04.431
I wish we had more time to talk more, but thank you very much for being with us, Rich Thomas, and thank you for your service.

27:04.871 --> 27:06.673
Tom, thank you for having me.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.835
All right, we appreciate it.

27:08.416 --> 27:13.602
So now you understand why Rich Thomas considers the Leonard F. Mason like one of the family.

27:13.582 --> 27:22.722
Each year, some 100 gather those who sailed on the Mason between when it was launched in January of 1946 and when it was struck in 1976.

27:23.103 --> 27:26.991
The USS Mason was eventually sold to Taiwan.

27:27.452 --> 27:29.016
It was decommissioned in 2000.

27:29.036 --> 27:29.978
And its fate?

27:30.659 --> 27:33.345
Well, it was sunk to create an artificial reef.

27:33.730 --> 27:34.371
So it's gone.

27:34.832 --> 27:37.656
But the memories of the proud destroyer will never die.

27:37.676 --> 27:39.518
Certainly not for Rich Thomas.

27:39.538 --> 27:42.943
We thank him for his service, as we thank all veterans.

27:43.524 --> 27:46.509
And we thank our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:46.529 --> 27:52.257
For more stories about veterans of the Brazos Valley, read Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:52.678 --> 27:54.420
For Rich Thomas, I'm Tom Turberville.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.004
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:11.463 --> 28:29.590
you you
