Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.213 --> 00:31.234
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:32.055 --> 00:38.261
For 17 years, Jim and Doris Saunders owned and operated Saunders Sausage Shop in South College Station.

00:38.762 --> 00:42.526
Since they sold that business in 1983, they've enjoyed retirement.

00:42.546 --> 00:45.489
Much of it viewed out the window of their well-traveled RV.

00:46.190 --> 00:52.296
Jim and Doris met after his World War II service in the 1st Cavalry F Troop.

00:52.316 --> 00:54.338
It's stationed in the Philippines near War's End.

00:54.925 --> 01:11.302
He was on one of the ships at Tokyo Bay, September 2, 1945, when the peace treaty was signed on the USS Missouri, and it was his band of brothers, NF Troop, that served as General Douglas MacArthur's honor guard on his march into Tokyo six days later, September 8.

01:11.904 --> 01:12.445
Please welcome.

01:12.762 --> 01:16.368
World War II veteran Jim Saunders to Veterans of the Valley.

01:16.908 --> 01:20.394
Jim, it's a pleasure to have you here and thank you for your service.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.797
You were drafted in 1944 into the Army.

01:22.837 --> 01:24.260
You were living in Wisconsin then.

01:24.660 --> 01:25.662
Sort of take us from there.

01:25.682 --> 01:28.065
I think you went down to what then was called Camp Hood.

01:28.106 --> 01:30.409
It's now Fort Hood for your basic training.

01:30.449 --> 01:31.391
Sort of take us from there.

01:32.312 --> 01:39.483
Well, I was in Camp Hood until I completed my basic training.

01:39.503 --> 01:40.204
At that time,

01:40.657 --> 01:47.627
We had an eight weeks course before you're shipped overseas.

01:47.647 --> 01:54.317
But I got sick the last week or so while I was on bivouac and I had to go in the hospital.

01:54.998 --> 01:58.243
And so then they assigned me to another

01:58.223 --> 02:05.835
another troop when I got out, and another outfit, and they were all Puerto Ricans.

02:06.677 --> 02:15.611
And of course, I asked a few of them to speak English so I could understand them, which they did.

02:15.731 --> 02:17.053
They were pretty good.

02:17.173 --> 02:18.976
But they were all shipped out.

02:19.056 --> 02:23.644
I don't know where they went to or anything like that after we completed our training.

02:24.164 --> 02:25.767
I went home for

02:26.033 --> 02:27.375
I think seven days.

02:28.056 --> 02:44.298
And there I left, I went to Fort Ord, California on a troop train and waited there until my orders to go overseas.

02:45.560 --> 02:55.534
And I left, I think it was April the 6th of 45.

02:56.257 --> 02:57.800
to go overseas.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.447
On the way over, I know President Roosevelt died.

03:02.467 --> 03:08.838
Of course, then President Truman came in.

03:09.599 --> 03:11.983
What was the communication like back then?

03:12.564 --> 03:15.970
Were you all made aware of President Roosevelt's death?

03:16.186 --> 03:16.967
fairly quickly?

03:17.688 --> 03:23.316
Yeah, the Navy announced it on board ship there.

03:23.636 --> 03:30.866
I don't know how they got their communications, but they got it through probably CW or something like that.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.328
You were on the USS Sturgis.

03:33.209 --> 03:34.051
It wasn't a bad ship.

03:34.071 --> 03:35.973
You sort of blended it in with the Navy, right?

03:36.454 --> 03:45.366
That was a Navy ship, and we had three meals a day, and we were treated real nice all the way over.

03:45.582 --> 04:00.537
But I slept on board the ship on the flat steel deck right behind one of those 17-inch guns.

04:02.187 --> 04:12.923
It took us 31 days to cross and I think I slept 28 on the steel there.

04:12.943 --> 04:21.175
And one time they were going to do a little target practice

04:21.593 --> 04:25.739
And they shot those guns off, and I think I went about three foot in the air.

04:26.961 --> 04:30.446
And I still have a habit of doing that.

04:30.466 --> 04:32.069
They didn't give you much warning, huh?

04:32.089 --> 04:33.871
No, there's no warning whatsoever.

04:34.212 --> 04:38.298
But they were shooting that, I think, a weather balloon.

04:38.318 --> 04:39.279
Right.

04:39.460 --> 04:46.470
And so, but we went to New Guinea first.

04:47.193 --> 04:55.121
And we left there 24 hours or 72 hours later.

04:55.781 --> 05:00.646
And when I woke up, there was hundreds and hundreds of ships around.

05:01.447 --> 05:02.468
And there was a convoy.

05:03.048 --> 05:06.892
And we were going down to the Philippines, which wasn't too far.

05:07.012 --> 05:15.360
But I guess at that time, when they went in a pack like that, they felt more safety.

05:15.982 --> 05:28.574
You told me that instead of sitting around, you were the volunteering type, and you volunteered to transport some 50-gallon drums with a couple of other guys loaded on some 6x6s, and that was a memorable trip.

05:28.594 --> 05:34.720
Yeah, I'll remember that, because that's when I got shot at.

05:35.621 --> 05:45.330
And I never had a rifle to shoot back, but I did jump out of the truck, run down the road,

05:45.766 --> 05:52.435
and waited for him to turn around, and he come down and picked us up, and we went back to camp.

05:53.056 --> 05:54.417
That was at our repple depple.

05:55.839 --> 05:59.444
That was before we were assigned to an outfit.

05:59.464 --> 06:00.526
Right.

06:00.546 --> 06:03.389
Then you tell me that the driver admitted that he'd gotten lost.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.951
It was dark, right?

06:04.971 --> 06:14.524
It was dark, and he would just come up to this bridge, and it was blowed out, and he hadn't

06:15.078 --> 06:21.364
He didn't know where he was at, and the lieutenant that was showing us the way, he didn't know where we was at.

06:22.244 --> 06:31.452
But anyways, we got back, and it was just a few days later I got shipped to the 1st Calvary Division, went to the F crew.

06:32.533 --> 06:43.583
And there, they were in the process of making a rest camp in a jungle area, but it was a coconut

06:44.778 --> 06:47.361
coconut grove.

06:47.381 --> 06:51.665
But in four years time it had growed up like a jungle.

06:51.685 --> 06:54.468
And they were in there cleaning it out and all that.

06:54.488 --> 07:01.435
I didn't say anything yesterday about helping to move some of these big boulders that they had.

07:01.455 --> 07:09.524
They dug a hole down on both sides and they were going to throw a chain down there and yanked the boulder out.

07:09.864 --> 07:13.688
So they threw the chain down there and

07:13.769 --> 07:18.116
Of course, I volunteered to reach down there and get the chain.

07:19.118 --> 07:22.965
And when I pulled a chain up, I had ants all over my arm.

07:23.045 --> 07:23.926
Oh, my goodness.

07:23.946 --> 07:26.090
And I got blood poison.

07:27.071 --> 07:36.267
And so I went to a sick call, and they gave me a shot and told me not to do that again.

07:37.833 --> 07:43.200
They needed some cook's helpers, evidently, and that's something else that you volunteered for.

07:43.220 --> 07:47.685
It wasn't very long after that I volunteered to be a cook's helper.

07:48.766 --> 07:48.886
Right.

07:48.906 --> 07:52.150
And we got one day on and two days off.

07:53.032 --> 07:58.318
And, of course, the time that we were off, we could go any place.

07:58.398 --> 08:05.747
We could pretty well travel, you know, right close by, but not too far because the Japanese

08:06.402 --> 08:13.589
was coming down to the place where our Filipinos were washing our clothes.

08:13.610 --> 08:19.376
And they would either cut an arm off or something like that for their lunch.

08:20.457 --> 08:26.563
And they resorted to Campbellism at that time of the war.

08:27.364 --> 08:33.270
And these were stragglers that's never been captured or anything like that.

08:33.537 --> 08:36.501
And so that put us on alert all the time.

08:38.925 --> 08:45.294
Then we went out for amphibious training in Subic Bay.

08:45.314 --> 08:53.225
And that's when we were out training, that's when we heard that they dropped the atomic bomb.

08:53.466 --> 08:59.815
Of course, at that time, they called it like a blockbuster because we couldn't understand

09:00.622 --> 09:02.965
what an atomic bomb would even do.

09:03.545 --> 09:09.753
And they'd start telling us what has it done, and it was just unbelievable.

09:09.773 --> 09:17.982
So, and it was just a couple days later, they said, well, the war was over and everything like that.

09:18.062 --> 09:28.975
Well, we got off, when we heard that, we were out on a training course,

09:29.663 --> 09:34.493
We would go out to the island on the

09:35.215 --> 09:42.903
landing craft, you know, go train a little bit, then come back and go back to the ship.

09:44.625 --> 09:53.674
Some of these veterans that were a lot older than me and had been in the war for three, four years, they had their rifles.

09:53.714 --> 09:58.619
They threw them in the river, not in the river, but in the ocean, in the Subic Bay.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.760
They said, well, it's over.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.843
We ain't going to need it.

10:02.823 --> 10:07.129
As far as I know, they didn't get reprimanded for it or anything like that.

10:08.030 --> 10:15.321
Your amphibious training, obviously, that was training for what was supposed to be a ground war in Japan.

10:15.561 --> 10:20.308
For the landing that was scheduled for October 1st.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.462
in Japan.

10:23.682 --> 10:29.588
Right, for what would have been a ground war that no one was looking forward to.

10:29.668 --> 10:33.592
The Japanese were pretty well fortified.

10:34.292 --> 10:43.361
They had tunnels built and they had ammunition and everything was close by.

10:43.762 --> 10:50.548
I was amazed at some of the trenches that they had

10:51.187 --> 10:52.953
how well they were.

10:53.616 --> 10:53.937
Yeah.

10:53.957 --> 10:57.128
Well, the Marines at Iwo Jima could tell you that story.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.376
Obviously, they were well-fortified.

10:59.437 --> 11:02.327
But when the bomb did drop,

11:03.438 --> 11:11.409
You're saying that you didn't really understand at the time that that was something that would end the war or the reason that President Truman did it.

11:12.010 --> 11:25.648
No, because during basic training, they would read the paper to us, the whole troop, and would talk about blockbusters over in England.

11:26.962 --> 11:33.412
And when they talk about how many blockbusters this atomic bomb was, it was just kind of unrealistic.

11:34.814 --> 11:47.292
When we got to Japan, we went to the... At first, we was in tents until we went to the Navy barracks.

11:47.312 --> 11:54.122
But everything around the Navy barracks was bombed out.

11:54.142 --> 11:56.766
It was pinpoint bombing by the...

11:57.286 --> 12:03.377
the Air Force, what do you call it, the Air… Army Air Corps.

12:03.397 --> 12:04.640
Army Air Corps at the time.

12:05.341 --> 12:18.045
And that was amazing to get lost in Yokohama there.

12:19.443 --> 12:25.293
You ended up, I want you to tell me, you talked about when you were on the ship to Japan, you ran into the typhoon.

12:25.453 --> 12:31.063
So even though the war was over, your biggest danger was ahead of you fighting that typhoon, right?

12:31.083 --> 12:40.759
We got out for a day and then we were ordered to come back into Subic Bay for 72 hours.

12:41.313 --> 12:47.341
We stayed there 24 and took out again, and that's when we hit that high water.

12:47.401 --> 12:55.272
I mean, that water was rough, and it's the closest thing I got to being seasick.

12:55.893 --> 13:02.882
But the propellers would come out of the ship and just vibrate the whole ship.

13:04.178 --> 13:11.250
You kind of wonder what all those nuts and bolts are going to be able to withstand it, but they did.

13:11.311 --> 13:13.755
They withstand it.

13:13.775 --> 13:21.168
But instead of fighting the ground war, you found yourself as part of the occupation forces for Japan and Tokyo Bay to September 1945.

13:21.228 --> 13:26.878
Talk about that experience of being there in the Bay where the treaty was signed.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.786
That's where we had a thousand airplanes come over.

13:30.806 --> 13:32.388
It was just like a cloud.

13:33.169 --> 13:34.752
I think they were B-17s.

13:35.833 --> 13:41.702
And it was just like a cloud that overshadowed the thing.

13:47.551 --> 13:55.262
We weren't that close to the USS Missouri, but we unloaded

13:55.968 --> 13:58.814
at that time in Yokohama.

13:59.796 --> 14:03.584
And that's where we put up for a few days.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.633
Well, that's where the Navy barracks was.

14:08.555 --> 14:14.989
And of course, I experienced

14:17.180 --> 14:29.279
the number of earthquakes that they have in Japan at the time, it was kind of jittery, but I mean, nothing would fall down, it would just shake.

14:29.299 --> 14:45.263
And six days later, F Troop had earned the honor to be the honor guard for General MacArthur as he marched into Tokyo on 8 September 1945.

14:45.530 --> 14:50.536
As a matter of fact, there's a little song that goes with that.

14:50.616 --> 14:51.517
What is it?

14:51.537 --> 14:52.699
Yeah.

14:52.719 --> 14:55.943
Many may come and many may go, but we were first in Tokyo.

14:57.185 --> 14:58.967
That you all sang proudly.

14:59.187 --> 14:59.928
Yeah.

15:00.348 --> 15:06.736
Well, they have it on a billboard in the 1st Calvary Division there.

15:07.257 --> 15:09.580
I don't know if they still got it or not.

15:10.184 --> 15:22.536
General MacArthur had the reputation of he never saw a camera that he didn't like and so obviously there was a... What do you remember about that day and sort of the pageantry of that day of marching into Tokyo?

15:25.899 --> 15:38.672
Well, prior to that for a few days we was on a drill field and marching and we were competing against

15:40.238 --> 15:49.315
other troops, other battalions and all that, so it was kind of tiring.

15:49.676 --> 16:01.538
But after that, we did get a certificate saying that we were first in Tokyo, signed by Major Bell from 1st Calvary Division.

16:01.518 --> 16:05.830
and General Chase was our commanding general.

16:06.292 --> 16:09.300
And I think he's still living in Houston.

16:09.320 --> 16:09.741
Is that right?

16:12.329 --> 16:13.131
You were...

16:14.208 --> 16:20.078
One of the jobs as part of the occupation in Tokyo is you were in charge of securing one of the bigger banks.

16:21.119 --> 16:21.740
Right, right.

16:23.203 --> 16:32.138
Our troop was in charge of guarding the bank and also around the imperial headquarters.

16:34.001 --> 16:36.064
They had troops based around there.

16:37.310 --> 16:58.862
I didn't stay in there very long because it came that I was going to get out with points and they came back with a re-enlistment program because right at that time I was in the United States Army and

17:00.344 --> 17:02.468
Army of the United States, I should say.

17:02.768 --> 17:13.005
And it came that you could re-enlist and go in the United States Army and retain your same rank, be a permanent rank.

17:13.025 --> 17:15.068
So that sounded pretty good.

17:16.030 --> 17:23.382
So I re-enlisted for 18 more months, figuring that I would stay in Japan.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.267
And it was just a short time

17:26.500 --> 17:29.203
three, four weeks and I was on my way back to the States.

17:30.984 --> 17:51.224
And that 18 months went by real fast because I went to Camp McCoy, Wisconsin and I took a 66 day leave of absence and went to Fort Sheridan.

17:53.587 --> 17:54.988
Then from Fort Sheridan

17:55.812 --> 17:57.874
I went to Fort Riley.

17:58.375 --> 18:02.959
I kind of shuddered about that because I figured I'd have to ride a horse.

18:04.401 --> 18:09.846
Although I was pretty well born and raised on a farm, I still didn't want to ride a horse.

18:10.747 --> 18:11.909
But you didn't have to ride a horse.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.151
Instead, they sent you to the radio school.

18:14.171 --> 18:16.473
Yeah, it was all mechanized.

18:16.493 --> 18:24.081
It was a mechanized reconnaissance deal in Fort Riley.

18:24.635 --> 18:28.041
So when I got there, well, it wasn't very long.

18:28.121 --> 18:37.676
I come back from a three-day furlough, a three-day pass, and the first sergeant wanted to know if I knew how to operate a radio.

18:37.696 --> 18:39.760
I said, well, I know how to turn them on and off.

18:40.741 --> 18:41.202
It was good.

18:41.222 --> 18:43.446
He says, yeah, you go to radio school.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.671
So he assigned me to the radio school.

18:47.432 --> 18:50.878
So I went there, and I spent, I think it was

18:51.415 --> 18:54.519
I think it was eight or nine weeks of radio school.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.326
That's when they just slapped the earphones on you.

18:59.346 --> 19:08.698
And you'd hear the CW come across continuous wave sounds.

19:08.718 --> 19:11.522
And you'd pick out what you know.

19:11.542 --> 19:17.790
Well, I've already known that the three Dits and three Dodges is SOS.

19:17.810 --> 19:21.355
And so eventually,

19:21.520 --> 19:28.109
I learned the Morse code and was able to send it on a bug.

19:29.030 --> 19:37.361
So I graduated from there and then I went to radio repair.

19:39.523 --> 19:50.818
There we had to build a five tube super heterodyne receiver and also being able to test

19:51.980 --> 19:58.629
test radio units and try to figure out what's wrong with them and all that and repair.

19:59.370 --> 20:07.780
So I did that, got a job as an instructor in the Department of Communications.

20:08.962 --> 20:19.776
All this time my re-enlistment was coming up and the last 13 days I spent in the Army was they shipped me down to

20:20.212 --> 20:25.477
camp function under foresight out of Fort Riley to be a cook.

20:27.219 --> 20:31.304
I was down there the first night I was down there all by myself.

20:33.486 --> 20:35.808
Nobody was down there except me.

20:35.828 --> 20:38.992
So I had no way of protection.

20:39.032 --> 20:40.153
I didn't have any vehicle.

20:40.793 --> 20:45.979
So the only thing I had the next day, I told him that I didn't like it.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.122
He said, well, that's what you'll have to do.

20:49.304 --> 20:50.687
I'm going into town tonight.

20:51.229 --> 20:53.314
So I walked into Junction City.

20:53.896 --> 20:55.099
Got myself a hotel.

20:55.620 --> 20:59.229
Next day I could hitchhike out back to camp.

20:59.249 --> 21:02.858
But then my enlistment

21:03.580 --> 21:10.187
Well, I came up to re-enlist again, and I took my time about that.

21:11.068 --> 21:26.025
But I got my discharge, and I stayed around Junction City for 30 days, debating amongst myself whether or not to go back in.

21:26.045 --> 21:31.731
And whether or not I had two lieutenant colonels

21:32.420 --> 21:35.586
One wants me, one there, one wants me there.

21:35.886 --> 21:41.736
And I just kind of shouted, I said, well, I just think I'll go home.

21:42.037 --> 21:49.791
But I made up my mind that I was going to retire within 20 years, which I pretty well did.

21:51.313 --> 21:56.723
In one way, but my wife will tell you, I've already retired three, four times.

21:57.243 --> 22:01.852
You and your wife Doris were married in 1957 after you got back from the war.

22:01.892 --> 22:03.214
But I want you to tell a story real quick.

22:03.234 --> 22:09.086
You went back to Wisconsin and you had bought a car that a fella took without asking and wrecked it.

22:09.466 --> 22:09.927
Right.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.432
That was when I was in Fort Riley, Kansas.

22:12.592 --> 22:16.720
Right.

22:18.337 --> 22:26.231
He wrecked it, so he gave me some money and I went and bought what they called at that time a wizard.

22:26.251 --> 22:35.147
A wizard was a bicycle with a Maytag wash machine motor on it.

22:35.127 --> 22:37.670
Not a real sophisticated form of transportation.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.254
No, not real, but that was the going thing at that time.

22:40.334 --> 22:41.836
Right.

22:41.856 --> 22:42.637
In 1947.

22:42.717 --> 22:43.077
Sure.

22:43.338 --> 22:46.542
So I decided I'd go home.

22:47.042 --> 22:51.488
My home was about 600 miles from Fort Riley.

22:51.829 --> 22:52.550
Yeah.

22:52.570 --> 22:56.815
So it cost me $1.95 for gas and oil.

22:58.465 --> 22:59.046
go there.

23:00.067 --> 23:02.591
And you said that thing would get up to 30, 35 miles an hour.

23:02.611 --> 23:10.483
It would go 25, 30 miles an hour just on a straightaway and then you go downhill, you can go 50.

23:11.324 --> 23:16.071
And this was in July, so it wasn't necessarily a weather problem.

23:16.171 --> 23:18.335
No, I didn't have any weather.

23:19.616 --> 23:22.701
I could pull alongside a bar ditch and go to sleep.

23:23.221 --> 23:29.951
You were 21 years old at this time, and you were out of the service, and then you worked a lot of different jobs.

23:29.971 --> 23:32.375
You worked on a farm, I guess, with your dad for a while.

23:32.395 --> 23:37.142
You unloaded lumber from boxcars for, you told me, 75 cents an hour.

23:37.203 --> 23:39.807
You delivered seven-ups for a penny a case.

23:40.568 --> 23:42.491
Yeah, and so much a week.

23:42.511 --> 23:43.993
And so much a week.

23:44.574 --> 23:49.301
Worked at a service station as a mechanic, and then you ran your own service station for a while, right?

23:49.662 --> 23:50.443
Right.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.378
Sort of take us after that.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.282
You went to work in North Chicago.

23:56.044 --> 24:01.392
And sort of take us on your career before you got into the trucking business, the truck driving business.

24:01.412 --> 24:05.978
I worked in Chicago at a Meadow Ledger School.

24:09.243 --> 24:10.465
Selenium rectifiers.

24:10.485 --> 24:15.713
Yeah, selenium rectifiers as more of an inspector.

24:16.113 --> 24:16.694
Right.

24:16.714 --> 24:20.700
So with the background I had in the Army,

24:20.984 --> 24:31.494
On radio repair, give me the training that I needed to take that job.

24:32.495 --> 24:43.186
And then I left there and went back, helped my dad on the farm.

24:43.246 --> 24:46.609
I stayed there several years.

24:46.629 --> 24:49.692
And then I went trucking business with my brother.

24:49.891 --> 24:53.556
two-man operation from Chicago, New York City.

24:53.576 --> 25:17.087
I worked there with him for about six months, and truck broke down, and the company wanted me to drive truck for them, which I did, and I was there about a month, and then they offered me a job as a supervisor for hiring and trained drivers, which I did.

25:17.107 --> 25:18.649
Right, and this was a, go ahead.

25:18.933 --> 25:19.895
For 13 years.

25:20.175 --> 25:25.263
This was a trucking company that was actually sort of hired to the Jewel T Company.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.166
Right.

25:27.347 --> 25:40.047
The Jewel T Company would hire drivers out of rent our car lines and leasing company, which is all right.

25:40.735 --> 25:51.310
And one of your jobs, I think you said that a driver in Houston had gotten injured and you had to go down and hire a new driver and you met an office manager with Jewel T named Doris, right?

25:51.330 --> 25:51.931
Yeah, that's right.

25:51.971 --> 25:57.899
And I was stationed there just a little longer than what I usually do.

25:58.340 --> 26:02.926
They usually send me into some place and I'm usually there a week or two and that's it.

26:02.946 --> 26:06.211
But I was there in Houston for almost six weeks.

26:06.471 --> 26:06.912
Right.

26:06.892 --> 26:11.155
So I got done, I was engaged.

26:12.361 --> 26:15.096
Six weeks will do that to you.

26:15.464 --> 26:18.888
You married Doris, I think you said in 1957.

26:18.948 --> 26:19.149
Right.

26:19.209 --> 26:22.493
So y'all have been married now some 52 years.

26:22.513 --> 26:23.414
52 years.

26:23.434 --> 26:25.397
And you finally came to Texas.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.280
You said the grass was greener, a little greener in Texas.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.825
You were in Carlos for a while and started raising hogs.

26:31.865 --> 26:34.368
And that sort of led you into the sausage shop.

26:34.428 --> 26:36.411
Is that right?

26:36.611 --> 26:37.912
No, no.

26:37.932 --> 26:44.661
My brother-in-law, Doris's brother, had the sausage shop and the...

26:45.586 --> 26:47.490
hog farm there.

26:48.031 --> 26:55.929
And he went to teach helicopter pilots in the Vietnam War.

26:56.470 --> 27:02.724
And so he offered me a deal to come down and take over the operation.

27:02.764 --> 27:03.105
I see.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.792
So I said, sure, I'll do that.

27:05.812 --> 27:06.272
Let's do it.

27:06.813 --> 27:07.954
We're out of time.

27:07.994 --> 27:14.879
I wish we could talk more, but you had the sausage shop, and of course, you and Doris give an awful lot of time to the VFW here locally, 4692.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.682
And we're out of time, but I want to thank you for your service.

27:18.282 --> 27:18.482
Sure.

27:19.043 --> 27:19.243
Thank you.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.124
Thank you.

27:20.144 --> 27:31.733
Jim Saunders didn't start out in Texas, but after his three years in the Army and his World War II service, he brought his wife, Doris, back to the Brazos Valley, where they worked hard, and now they enjoy their well-deserved retirement.

27:32.074 --> 27:33.615
We thank them for their service.

27:33.595 --> 27:34.725
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:34.846 --> 27:36.923
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
