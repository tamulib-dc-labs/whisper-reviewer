00:08.485 --> 00:31.580
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.042
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.372 --> 00:40.160
June the 18th, 1972, was the first Father's Day that Vic Reid would observe as a dad.

00:41.081 --> 00:46.529
But that celebration would have to wait, and very nearly never happened at all.

00:46.549 --> 01:03.973
Because on that summer day, as a member of the 16th Special Ops Squadron of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand, Colonel Vic Reid was flying his 44th aerial combat mission over the Achao Valley in South Vietnam.

01:04.679 --> 01:06.902
He wasn't supposed to be flying that night.

01:06.922 --> 01:21.218
He was subbing as a navigator one of the crew of 15 on the AC-130 Spectra gunship, whose mission it was to attack targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and targets of opportunity in northwestern South Vietnam.

01:22.039 --> 01:23.020
Colonel Vic Reid, U.S.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.125
Air Force retired, is our honored guest today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:27.145 --> 01:28.847
Colonel Reid, thank you for joining us.

01:29.452 --> 01:32.194
Take us from that spot, June the 18th.

01:32.555 --> 01:33.976
You weren't supposed to be flying that day.

01:34.036 --> 01:35.477
Why not?

01:35.497 --> 01:41.883
Well, I had flown several missions in a row on the day before, the week before.

01:42.703 --> 01:49.689
And I was saying goodbye to one of our fellow crew members who had finished his one-year tour.

01:50.390 --> 01:53.472
And so I was not supposed to fly the next day.

01:53.492 --> 01:59.037
And they had one of the normal crew member had called in,

01:59.624 --> 02:04.110
duty not including flying, DNF as we call it in the Air Force.

02:04.130 --> 02:17.428
And they couldn't find someone to replace him, so they tried another officer who was a friend of mine who I'd gone through NAV training with, but they couldn't locate him in time for the flight.

02:18.329 --> 02:27.141
So they came and woke me up, and I had to catch up with the crew because they were already going through their briefings and getting prepared for the mission.

02:27.161 --> 02:29.023
There's a lot of paperwork involved with flying.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.319
And so I caught up with them.

02:31.339 --> 02:35.224
It was a stand-eval crew, a standardization evaluation instructor crew.

02:36.165 --> 02:40.751
And as an instructor, that was one reason that I was selected.

02:40.771 --> 02:46.739
So I went on the mission with them as a low-level television operator navigator.

02:46.759 --> 02:51.526
And we were looking for targets of opportunity and trucks along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

02:52.607 --> 02:59.196
And we discovered a truck sitting out in the open, so we engaged the target, went into our orbit for firing.

03:00.138 --> 03:04.906
when we were getting accurate AAA from several AAA sites.

03:05.347 --> 03:08.011
Now AAA is anti-aircraft?

03:08.031 --> 03:08.452
Artillery.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.213
Artillery, okay.

03:10.195 --> 03:16.105
And as a result of the accurate AAA fire, we had to break out of our orbit several times.

03:16.726 --> 03:32.824
On the fourth attempt to reengage the target in our orbit, we had a SA-7 handheld missile fired at us called Strela, which came up across from the aircraft six o'clock position.

03:32.844 --> 03:40.312
And it didn't take long for the missile to hit the number three engine of the airplane on the right side of the airplane, closest to the fuselage.

03:41.353 --> 03:44.877
And apparently the wing immediately departed the aircraft.

03:45.532 --> 03:47.138
and we went into a flat spin.

03:47.995 --> 03:52.260
The pilots had given the bailout signal, but we were all pinned inside the airplane.

03:53.482 --> 04:03.194
And so I knew I was in serious trouble when there was a... There's a centrifugal force type of thing happening because the plane is spinning.

04:03.615 --> 04:04.976
You're on a plane without a wing.

04:04.997 --> 04:05.737
Right.

04:05.757 --> 04:07.299
And it's going into a flat spin.

04:07.700 --> 04:12.286
So that force just causes you to be basically immobile.

04:13.247 --> 04:15.690
And then there was a gigantic explosion.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.571
And I thought I was either free falling or dying.

04:19.611 --> 04:20.453
I wasn't sure which.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.377
So I pulled the D ring on my parachute.

04:23.259 --> 04:25.264
And fortunately, my parachute opened.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.232
It's an explosion that blew you out of the plane and probably an explosion that saved your life.

04:29.814 --> 04:30.315
Exactly.

04:30.455 --> 04:31.317
Right.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.700
And when I came out.

04:33.642 --> 05:01.354
was slowed down by the by the parachute opening I noticed that my risers were wrapped all the way to the canopy so I didn't have a full canopy so I bicycle to get the canopy to fully open I could see the main part of what was left of the airplane going down on fire into the jungle and I could see another parachute off in the distance so obviously someone else had gotten out of the airplane there were also parts of the airplane that had fallen

05:01.891 --> 05:05.594
down below where I was descending that were on fire.

05:06.555 --> 05:09.138
And I also noticed that it was near a triple A site.

05:10.539 --> 05:15.143
So when I came down into the trees, the parachute canopy caught on top of the trees.

05:15.924 --> 05:29.316
I went through those trees fairly unscathed and I did one big bounce and set right down on my rear end so that I could just disconnect from my parachute harness.

05:29.482 --> 05:35.568
And because I knew where that AAA site was, I headed off in the opposite direction for about 15 minutes.

05:35.848 --> 05:36.328
Good idea.

05:36.529 --> 05:44.997
So I was basically on all fours going through the jungle trying to get away from them because I figured they probably saw me.

05:46.118 --> 05:59.050
And so after I got away from them for about 15 minutes, I found a good hiding place, got out my survival radio, and made contact with the first person I could make contact with.

05:59.823 --> 06:02.138
And they told me to come up on

06:02.540 --> 06:04.402
radio every hour on the hour.

06:05.344 --> 06:08.047
They were going to try and pick me up at first light.

06:08.067 --> 06:14.356
So basically I stayed in that hiding place listening for the hostile forces.

06:15.377 --> 06:19.222
They were still shooting AAA at other airplanes that were in the area.

06:20.103 --> 06:24.289
And so I found a good place to hide.

06:24.569 --> 06:31.298
Like I said, I discovered at that time that there was something wet in my left boot

06:32.189 --> 06:54.838
and so I decided that I must have been injured I felt around and found this gaping hole in my boot and put it up against a tree and applied pressure with my other foot to in order to stop the bleeding which it worked I felt relatively safe in my location because there were little animals crawling all over me and I figured if they weren't afraid of anybody else

06:55.409 --> 07:00.398
you know, being around, that I was okay for that time.

07:00.418 --> 07:14.565
So I continued to call every hour on the hour, and about the time it got to dusk, they informed me that they weren't going to be able to come in and get me at first light, which was a pretty deflated situation for me.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.991
because I was really anxious to get out of there.

07:17.372 --> 07:28.653
I'll tell you what, what I'd like to do now before we get to the story of your rescue, which is pretty phenomenal as it is, I'd like to go ahead and, if we can, show some pictures that you have brought along with you.

07:29.414 --> 07:37.228
And I guess if we could go to those, one of the first pictures is Colonel Vic Reid, and there you are.

07:38.035 --> 07:40.298
So this picture was taken about when?

07:40.378 --> 07:42.481
Was this during your Vietnam service?

07:42.501 --> 07:44.443
No, this is actually a picture from 93.

07:44.504 --> 07:45.925
Oh, I see.

07:46.166 --> 07:51.212
When I was in Vietnam in Southeast Asia, I was a second lieutenant.

07:51.232 --> 07:55.298
And I was one of the lowest ranking members of the 16th SOS.

07:56.039 --> 07:59.183
This is a picture that was taken

07:59.568 --> 08:02.112
about a year after I pinned on Full Kernel.

08:02.833 --> 08:08.762
So this was at about the time, and I know later on you also served in Desert Shield before Desert Storm, is that right?

08:08.782 --> 08:10.425
So this picture was taken right about that time?

08:11.246 --> 08:16.895
The picture was taken actually after I returned from Desert Shield.

08:17.756 --> 08:27.651
I was a base commander at Jeddah Saudi Arabia during Desert Shield, and basically it's like being a city manager, and I had

08:28.070 --> 08:33.642
In my position, I was responsible for Taif Air Force Base as well as a regional base commander.

08:34.304 --> 08:38.233
And the main reason for that was because the king lived in both locations.

08:38.253 --> 08:47.293
So a lot of my duties involved political process and had to handle a lot of dignitaries coming through to visit with the king.

08:47.965 --> 08:52.471
I want to get an idea of the airplane that you were involved in when we talk about that was shot down.

08:52.511 --> 08:56.376
And there's a picture of the Spectre.

08:56.817 --> 08:59.581
Talk a little bit about that ship.

08:59.601 --> 09:02.124
Well, the engine is, I mean, the airplane, I'm sorry.

09:02.144 --> 09:06.430
The airplane is basically what they call in the Air Force a trash hauler.

09:06.450 --> 09:13.740
It was designed to get everything from beans and bullets to the forces out in a location.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.685
And they converted it to a gunship by putting 20 millimeter cannon

09:17.800 --> 09:22.436
40 millimeter cannon and a 105 howitzer out the left side of the airplane.

09:22.456 --> 09:25.064
It was very sophisticated for its time.

09:25.085 --> 09:28.215
It was all computerized and you had to fly in an orbit

09:28.853 --> 09:42.175
And basically all the navigators were the ones who operated the computers and the sensor capability and also targeted with their instruments so that the guns would shoot accurately.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.022
And it was a very, very good system.

09:46.743 --> 09:50.389
As a matter of fact, the airplane is still being used by Air Forces now.

09:50.369 --> 09:51.450
Is that right?

09:51.470 --> 09:55.715
Is this the plane that you told me, is this the plane that's on display in Florida?

09:55.736 --> 09:56.216
Is that right?

09:56.456 --> 10:09.813
Yeah, this is an old A model, AC-130, and my son is stationed at Hurlburt Field in Florida, where I went through gunship training, and one of the airplanes that I flew a number of times is on static display at the front gate.

10:10.794 --> 10:13.457
I couldn't believe it when I saw the tail number there on a visit.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.263
check my log book, and sure enough, I'd flown that airplane.

10:16.343 --> 10:19.286
So it made me age about 10 years at least.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.170
Indeed it did.

10:24.991 --> 10:32.079
I'd like to go and talk a little bit more about your rescue now, sort of pick up where you left off.

10:32.139 --> 10:37.364
You're on the ground, the bad guys are around you, and you're looking for a good place to hide, a better place than you were before.

10:37.424 --> 10:37.844
Is that right?

10:37.924 --> 10:38.165
Right.

10:39.106 --> 10:43.410
When light started showing, I discovered

10:43.998 --> 10:46.901
that I was in not a very good hiding place.

10:46.921 --> 10:49.343
So I decided I needed to find a better place to hide.

10:50.204 --> 10:58.312
And so I scrambled further away in the correct direction to get further away from the AAA site.

10:58.332 --> 11:06.279
I found a great place on a slope that had a fallen tree and I could burrow underneath it so I could just raise the antenna on my radio.

11:06.299 --> 11:11.524
And at that same time, I decided that the photo of my daughter and wife

11:12.027 --> 11:15.691
Probably not a good thing for me to have on if I was captured.

11:16.332 --> 11:20.977
Along with my Aggie ring, I buried them in the ground there near my hiding place.

11:21.979 --> 11:29.067
And I just continued to talk to the forces that were providing air support for me.

11:29.087 --> 11:33.092
And they told me that they were gonna be coming in with some ordnance.

11:33.112 --> 11:41.241
And basically all day long that's what happened, is that there were hostiles beating on the trees, running by my position,

11:41.575 --> 11:48.265
firing their weapon, yelling, trying to get me to jump up and disclose where I was hiding.

11:49.126 --> 11:55.977
And so this went on all day long where they were pounding the bad guys, if you will.

11:55.997 --> 12:04.309
And finally, towards the end of the day, daylight, they called and said that we're ready to pick you up.

12:04.778 --> 12:10.467
We understand that you're injured, so we can send down a PJ for you.

12:10.487 --> 12:11.629
We'll pick you up first.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.854
And that was the first point that I realized that there were other survivors.

12:15.856 --> 12:21.806
And so I said, no, I can handle getting on the lift and getting on the helicopter all by myself.

12:21.826 --> 12:24.630
There's no reason to send anybody down for me.

12:24.650 --> 12:29.959
And so they sent in the Sandys, the A1E airplanes, to locate my position.

12:31.120 --> 12:44.382
Because of the density of the jungle and because of all the firing that was going on at them, they were having trouble getting over into my area, and I couldn't see them very well.

12:44.723 --> 12:53.938
So an F-4 that was flying back from North Vietnam across the area gave a radio off my radio transmission, and they were able to get closer, and then I could direct them in.

12:54.644 --> 12:59.569
And in the process of finding my location, two of the Sandys got shot down.

12:59.589 --> 13:02.292
Fortunately, both pilots were picked up.

13:02.312 --> 13:07.377
And matter of fact, one of them came to see me in the hospital later to see how I was doing.

13:08.018 --> 13:11.462
But at that point, they were ready to come in.

13:11.702 --> 13:13.764
They said, pop your smoke when we give you the signal.

13:14.685 --> 13:16.587
They dropped the device.

13:17.608 --> 13:22.373
It was only about 20 yards from where I was located.

13:23.045 --> 13:25.167
And I scrambled over there, got on the lift.

13:25.307 --> 13:27.350
They started pulling me up into the helicopter.

13:28.251 --> 13:30.593
And I met the canopy.

13:30.613 --> 13:32.916
It wouldn't pull me through the canopy of the jungle.

13:33.657 --> 13:41.385
So the crew lowered me a couple of feet, and I managed to raise my legs up and kick a hole large enough for them to pull me through.

13:42.346 --> 13:45.930
And once I was on the helicopter, I just kind of laid on the deck hugging it.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.228
I was so glad to be picked up.

13:49.189 --> 13:56.158
And then the helicopter flew over and picked up the other two survivors who were fortunately uninjured.

13:56.178 --> 14:04.528
I know that the thoughts that you had during this time, during this some 18 hours in the jungle, not knowing exactly what your fate would be, a lot of thoughts went through your mind.

14:05.029 --> 14:11.637
And you brought with you, I guess, sort of a summary of what it was like to be in that situation.

14:11.657 --> 14:12.498
You put on a plaque.

14:12.919 --> 14:13.099
Right.

14:13.366 --> 14:16.589
And you brought that plaque and I think that we got a picture of that right there.

14:17.990 --> 14:18.571
What does that say?

14:18.631 --> 14:19.552
Read that for us.

14:19.572 --> 14:23.475
It's really kind of captured the essence of how I felt after I was recovered.

14:23.495 --> 14:28.059
You have never been, you have never lived till you have almost died.

14:28.079 --> 14:34.025
And for those who fight for it, life has a flavor that protected will never know.

14:34.045 --> 14:34.305
Wow.

14:35.787 --> 14:39.510
And was that yours or where did you find that particular?

14:39.530 --> 14:42.833
Well, I was back at Ubon after 30 days.

14:43.370 --> 14:47.276
of being in the hospital at Clark Air Force Base.

14:47.817 --> 14:54.006
And when I came back, they couldn't put me immediately back on flight status until I could run again.

14:54.026 --> 15:01.598
And so I was looking around for doing some shopping around Ubon there, and I found this plaque.

15:02.202 --> 15:06.788
And I said, boy, this really captures how I feel at this point in my life.

15:07.890 --> 15:13.638
So it's prominently displayed on my wall at home.

15:14.259 --> 15:15.741
Something else is prominently displayed.

15:15.761 --> 15:21.068
You talked about that your only injury was the cut foot because of the shrapnel that went through the boot.

15:21.088 --> 15:26.215
Hold that up high here so that our camera can take a look at it here.

15:27.116 --> 15:27.737
That's the boot.

15:29.911 --> 15:31.974
They haven't touched it since.

15:31.994 --> 15:34.037
You can turn it around a little bit more so they can see the cut.

15:34.177 --> 15:38.363
Yeah, there's the cut that's in the boot.

15:38.383 --> 15:39.184
You haven't shined it.

15:39.224 --> 15:39.965
You haven't touched it.

15:39.985 --> 15:42.729
I think you even said even some of your dried blood is still there.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.311
It's still in there.

15:45.673 --> 15:45.933
Wow.

15:48.396 --> 15:49.458
That's something.

15:49.678 --> 15:50.740
That's a trophy for sure.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.183
Oh, absolutely.

15:53.203 --> 15:58.230
Talk about your thoughts, what you can remember from that day as you're waiting

15:58.666 --> 16:01.971
A lot of things go through your mind, family, future.

16:02.571 --> 16:04.013
Is there a future survival?

16:05.055 --> 16:06.337
What were your thoughts during that time?

16:07.338 --> 16:16.291
Amazingly, I felt like I was pretty calm because I did a lot of praying while I was there, had a lot of time on my hands.

16:16.311 --> 16:24.522
But I was thinking about my wife and my daughter, and it dawned on me at that point that it was the first Father's Day for me.

16:25.312 --> 16:36.148
And so I also had a little confidence in the fact, actually, I guess a lot of confidence in the fact that they were going to do everything they could to help rescue me.

16:36.280 --> 16:42.306
So it was up to me to try and do the best job I could to help myself.

16:42.687 --> 16:47.292
It was pretty lonely down there, you know, with all those hostiles around.

16:47.352 --> 16:56.622
But I think my faith was strengthened that day spiritually, you know, and it made a turning point in my life.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.465
It definitely was a significant emotional event for me.

17:00.666 --> 17:01.427
Indeed it was.

17:02.099 --> 17:07.670
You have a resume after you left Vietnam that I find rather phenomenal.

17:07.690 --> 17:14.283
I guess it's not uncommon for young people that are still in the military to keep on serving even after your service in Vietnam.

17:14.844 --> 17:17.629
Sort of talk about what you've been doing since then.

17:18.551 --> 17:19.433
OK.

17:19.801 --> 17:25.208
Well, when I came back from Southeast Asia, I was sent to a different airplane.

17:25.228 --> 17:31.055
So I went to the KC-135 air refueling aircraft, and I did that for about 10 years.

17:31.656 --> 17:42.129
I started out with an assignment at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York, and then I was upgraded to instructor while I was there and to a standing valve instructor navigator.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.133
So I was selected then to go to the

17:45.755 --> 17:54.347
to the schoolhouse for KC-135 at Castle Air Force Base, California, what we called our combat crew training school.

17:55.068 --> 18:05.822
While there, I was given an opportunity to be a wing staff officer in addition to flying, and then the wing commander selected me to be the wing executive officer.

18:06.427 --> 18:08.849
He often says that I helped him make his first star.

18:09.290 --> 18:15.235
So he helped me out by sending me to headquarters SAC as a command briefer and really enjoyed that.

18:15.296 --> 18:22.743
I was one of six young officers that were the spokesperson for the commander in chief of SAC and did that for three years.

18:23.283 --> 18:27.227
Then went to Air Command and Staff College in residence.

18:27.247 --> 18:29.649
And after that was selected for the faculty.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.594
I stayed on as a faculty member for three years, completed Air War College.

18:35.114 --> 18:41.762
And then at that time, they decided that they were going to send me to a different position, a non-flying position.

18:41.903 --> 18:47.329
So I went to, as the deputy base commander at Grand Forks Air Force Base.

18:47.350 --> 18:53.017
Probably one of the best jobs that I could ever enjoy in the Air Force because I thoroughly enjoyed it.

18:53.738 --> 18:55.800
As I mentioned, it's kind of like being a city manager.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.345
You had responsibility for everything on that base.

19:00.406 --> 19:04.311
And as a result of that, I got selected to be a base commander during Desert Shield.

19:04.730 --> 19:06.232
at Jeddah Saudi Arabia.

19:07.014 --> 19:16.670
And I had to return the day before it became Desert Storm because my boss back at Grand Forks was retiring all of a sudden.

19:16.690 --> 19:20.195
And so they had to fly me back, landed at Minot.

19:20.295 --> 19:23.220
I was the only person on an airplane.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.342
Got back to Minot.

19:24.558 --> 19:30.967
then drove back over to Grand Forks and assumed command of the group there as the base commander.

19:31.848 --> 19:42.584
And then after that, I was sent again to Offutt Air Force Base because the wing commander that I'd worked for was now a three star and he needed an executive officer.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.688
So he called me up and said, how would you like to come work for me again?

19:46.428 --> 19:49.052
and we're going to stand down Strategic Air Command in a year.

19:49.213 --> 19:54.882
So I went there and supported him, and we're really close friends.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.745
He lives in Omaha, Nebraska today.

19:57.707 --> 19:59.750
As a matter of fact, I'm going to see him in June again.

20:00.551 --> 20:07.002
And then after that occurred, we stood down SAC and stood up United States Strategic Command

20:07.724 --> 20:15.934
I became a speech writer and basically support officer for the Commander-in-Chief of United States Strategic Command.

20:17.476 --> 20:24.184
And while I was doing that, they promoted me to full colonel and decided that I needed a full colonel's job.

20:24.604 --> 20:29.010
And so I became a senior controller in the command center there at Offutt.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.152
And I did that for a couple of years.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.997
Very interesting work, but it's tough on the body with all the shift work.

20:35.753 --> 20:36.834
thoroughly enjoyed it.

20:36.975 --> 20:58.523
Then they made me a division chief for current operations at Strategic Command, and because it was a joint tour, I could only stay there for three years in that joint command, so they sent me to Air Mobility Command in 95, and I worked the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and I was the division chief for resources for the deputy commander for operations for Air Mobility Command.

20:59.785 --> 21:05.693
My wife and I had now had all of our kids go through Texas A&M,

21:06.348 --> 21:10.973
And so we decided it was time for us to look for other things to do.

21:11.433 --> 21:17.240
So we picked College Station and Bryan area to come back to, and I might finally get to see a football game.

21:18.120 --> 21:23.827
I want to talk about what you're doing now in a little bit, but I want to, while you were talking, it reminded me of something else that you told me.

21:25.248 --> 21:31.815
Because you were not scheduled to be on that flight, there was somewhat of a snafu that resulted in

21:32.183 --> 21:36.948
in the wrong people getting the wrong information and some people getting no information.

21:37.008 --> 21:38.309
Talk about that.

21:38.329 --> 21:47.939
Well back in 1972 they still had carbon paper and the flight orders had your name pre-printed on it and you had to sign on the flight orders.

21:48.760 --> 21:57.769
The only problem was that the about the third or fourth sheet down didn't go through very well on the carbon paper and so the person that was scheduled to be flying

21:58.424 --> 22:07.120
When we were shot down, his wife had the Air Force vehicle drive up to her home in Virginia and inform her that her husband was MIA.

22:08.222 --> 22:11.228
And it was really me who was MIA.

22:12.129 --> 22:15.876
And so my wife didn't find out until I called my dad.

22:16.227 --> 22:18.390
using the military phone system.

22:18.410 --> 22:26.141
He was the director of ops at Webb Air Force Base in Big Spring, and managed to get the word back to her that way.

22:26.161 --> 22:33.932
So it's really kind of a fog of war thing, where the notification process didn't really work very well in this case.

22:35.954 --> 22:44.225
Now you're back in Bryan College Station, and you and your wife, you're over at Blinn as a member of that staff.

22:44.265 --> 22:47.870
I want you to talk about the assistant dean.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.834
Talk about what your job is now over at Blinn College.

22:51.014 --> 22:52.115
Okay.

22:52.396 --> 22:55.800
Well, I came back here and retired on the 1st of July, 1997.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.764
I started working at Blinn on the 15th of July.

22:59.285 --> 23:01.388
Didn't get much of a break there.

23:01.408 --> 23:03.210
So I've been there seven and a half years now.

23:03.713 --> 23:22.144
I started out working in their adult and continuing education department and then I moved on to a grant project as executive director of tech prep and school to work and then I was selected in November 2000 to become the assistant dean

23:22.732 --> 23:25.115
And I've been doing that ever since.

23:25.135 --> 23:29.861
Basically, we're the technical and workforce education division for Blinn College.

23:30.001 --> 23:36.729
We provide all the technical and workforce education associate degrees and certificate programs for the college.

23:37.269 --> 23:46.140
And we also offer all the adult continuing education courses that you might see here in our region, in our service area for Blinn.

23:46.120 --> 23:57.128
In addition, we also have responsibility for a lot of the grants that we get with the Workforce Solutions Board here in this workforce development area.

23:57.148 --> 24:00.617
And we also get grants from other places as well.

24:00.798 --> 24:03.184
So it's a very challenging job, but I really enjoy it.

24:03.738 --> 24:07.704
Does it amaze you sometime how much you've packed into just 56 years of life already?

24:08.806 --> 24:10.949
Sometimes it does, like right now.

24:12.251 --> 24:21.905
I happen to use every skill that I have because I need to hire a new director, an assistant director, and my boss is now at a conference, so kind of wearing four hats today.

24:23.668 --> 24:26.893
I'm glad you're here wearing one of them right here and telling your story.

24:28.645 --> 24:34.974
Colonel Reid, Vietnam obviously is a war unlike any other as far as how it's treated in our history.

24:34.994 --> 24:36.335
It was certainly not a popular war.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.779
It was one that I grew up in.

24:39.059 --> 24:49.894
I did not serve in the war, but I was certainly aware by the news accounts and everything involved with the war and everything that the way it's still perceived today.

24:50.234 --> 24:58.045
What's your perception of the Vietnam War as you look back on it now as a soldier, as a person who fought, as a Purple Heart winner of Vietnam?

24:58.025 --> 25:19.773
Well, I feel like the problem that we had in Vietnam was the fact that the way the war was conducted, we had to fly and fight in such a strict rule of engagement environment that it was very difficult for us to really achieve some of the goals that we needed to achieve to be successful.

25:19.793 --> 25:27.222
I think I've always believed philosophically that the reason we were there was a very valid one.

25:27.893 --> 25:40.508
And I still feel like, you know, that we had a purpose in being there, even though the outcome was somewhat less than any of us, I think, at the time expected.

25:41.169 --> 25:46.875
But the people that I flew with, and they were just great people.

25:47.917 --> 25:52.842
That's one reason that I stayed in the Air Force and made it a career is because I really enjoyed the environment.

25:53.603 --> 25:55.065
I enjoyed the camaraderie.

25:55.687 --> 25:59.091
I enjoyed the fact that I was serving my country.

25:59.131 --> 26:05.579
Of course, a lot of that was instilled in me here at Texas A&M and the Corps of Cadets where I received my commission.

26:07.381 --> 26:09.344
Plus, I came from a military family.

26:10.064 --> 26:15.291
Those kind of things, those values had been instilled in me as a kid and they carried four.

26:15.411 --> 26:21.238
I basically volunteered to go over there because I felt it was my duty.

26:23.058 --> 26:25.782
Basically, I still support a lot of the folks.

26:25.942 --> 26:28.806
I'm a River Rat, a member of that.

26:28.946 --> 26:34.314
And so I stay tuned into what's going on with people that went through the same experience that I have.

26:35.215 --> 26:40.102
And of course, we've opened up the membership now to people that are younger than I am.

26:40.142 --> 26:44.127
So it keeps us fresh and haven't had original thought lately.

26:44.147 --> 26:46.230
So it helps to have young people there.

26:46.598 --> 26:49.381
Colonel Bickery, thank you for being here and thank you very much for your service.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.064
It's a wonderful and it's a fascinating story.

26:52.084 --> 26:53.406
And I'm glad that you are here.

26:53.426 --> 26:54.547
Thank you, I am too.

26:54.787 --> 26:55.388
It's been an honor.

26:55.869 --> 26:56.249
Thank you.

26:58.471 --> 27:03.497
The Vietnam War is still one of history's most controversial and debated conflicts.

27:03.918 --> 27:10.866
But one thing can never be debated, and that's the sacrifice that many young men and women gave to do their duty.

27:10.986 --> 27:14.850
More than 58,000 Americans gave their lives or were missing in action.

27:15.218 --> 27:17.303
Another 304,000 were wounded.

27:17.443 --> 27:20.670
In all, 2.6 million served, and we salute them all.

27:20.690 --> 27:22.614
Please thank a veteran today.

27:22.634 --> 27:25.921
For Colonel Robert Vic Reid, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:26.282 --> 27:41.074
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
