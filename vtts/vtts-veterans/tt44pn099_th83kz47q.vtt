00:05.465 --> 00:30.190
Thank you.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.012
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.232 --> 00:35.253
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.074 --> 00:36.475
C.O.

00:36.535 --> 00:46.025
Smith, Texas A&M class of 1950, is proud of the role that the United States Coast Guard played in World War II on board the Coast Guard Cutter Bramble.

00:46.506 --> 00:46.826
C.O.

00:46.866 --> 00:54.895
Smith spent the most part of four years at sea, almost making it to Europe before mechanical problems sent them to Puerto Rico to dry dock.

00:54.875 --> 01:02.886
and then through the Panama Canal to the Pacific and Alaska, where his crew supplied Navy Seabees who were building the Loran stations.

01:03.306 --> 01:05.930
You'll learn more about those as you meet C.O.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.314
Smith O'Brien today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:09.334 --> 01:10.075
Pleasure to have you here.

01:10.115 --> 01:11.897
Thank you for your service, Mr. Smith.

01:12.438 --> 01:19.007
You graduated from Wichita Falls High School in 1942, went to Midwestern for a year, and then to the Coast Guard in 1943.

01:19.067 --> 01:22.992
Talk about your path to the Coast Guard and what sent you there.

01:23.630 --> 01:30.502
Well, at that time, when you went through, everyone was going through the draft board, and so they divided us up, I mean, wherever they wanted us.

01:30.542 --> 01:35.550
So myself and two or three from our area sent us to Coast Guard.

01:37.513 --> 01:49.654
Went to what they call Treasure Island in Oakland, San Francisco Bay Area, boot camp, and had a beginning there, but out of that,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.470
I don't know why I was selected to go to the Coast Guard Academy.

01:54.853 --> 02:00.564
I think it was because I was familiar with equipment, machines.

02:00.644 --> 02:05.013
I'd rebuilt a car myself, a Model T Ford, as parts.

02:05.193 --> 02:08.379
And I guess that came out that I knew something about tools.

02:09.141 --> 02:11.305
So I became a diesel manufacturer.

02:11.285 --> 02:16.139
engine and diesel electric engine expert in about three months.

02:16.259 --> 02:21.915
Well, you were a prime candidate and you graduated the top of your class, but you were too young to be an officer because you weren't 21 yet.

02:22.175 --> 02:22.998
You were what?

02:23.118 --> 02:24.101
Only 18 years old.

02:24.662 --> 02:25.986
About 18 and a half.

02:26.253 --> 02:26.773
19.

02:27.114 --> 02:27.674
Right, right.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.276
So you're an apprentice seaman, which is?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.798
Apprentice is the lowest you can go when you first go in.

02:32.018 --> 02:32.258
Right.

02:32.578 --> 02:35.321
To a motor machinist for my first class.

02:35.441 --> 02:36.982
The equivalent of a master sergeant?

02:37.002 --> 02:37.303
Yeah.

02:37.343 --> 02:37.783
In the Army?

02:38.003 --> 02:38.363
Yeah.

02:38.383 --> 02:39.064
Is that right?

02:40.245 --> 02:52.295
So I got that promotion and didn't realize that I was in charge when it came to being aboard ship and had these big old diesel engines to go.

02:52.816 --> 02:53.116
Right.

02:53.236 --> 02:54.677
About 40 to 50 feet long.

02:55.178 --> 02:55.298
Right.

02:55.784 --> 03:05.233
So it wasn't long before you were going to go off to war, and the deployment was going to be to Europe, from the East Coast to Europe, but something happened along the way.

03:05.273 --> 03:06.294
So talk about that.

03:06.555 --> 03:10.018
Well, we caught the bramble, put aboard it.

03:10.479 --> 03:17.365
It was made in Duluth, Minnesota, and came down through the Great Lakes, down through St.

03:17.386 --> 03:21.910
Lawrence, and then we actually boarded it in New York.

03:22.430 --> 03:28.178
and went down then and outfitted at Fort Eustis, Virginia area.

03:29.619 --> 03:39.853
And we didn't know it, but when we first took out, we found out we were at sea and there were hundreds of ships half a mile or a mile apart as far as you could see.

03:40.714 --> 03:44.219
And we were doing submarine duty on the invasion fleet going to Europe.

03:45.921 --> 03:50.547
And that went real well until we got about to the middle of the Atlantic and we had a hurricane.

03:51.050 --> 03:56.437
that they didn't know about, or the timing was where everybody went.

03:56.457 --> 04:10.957
Our sister ship became disabled, lost its propulsion, and so whoever was in charge had us to take it under tow, and then we went out because there was a defect in the bearings of the propulsion.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.424
So you were towing it, and then the bramble went out.

04:16.845 --> 04:19.048
And, of course, we were in that storm,

04:19.923 --> 04:27.591
And I didn't realize it that the captain thought we were going to both get sunk because we'd get together in that storm and just destroy each other.

04:28.352 --> 04:35.900
But luckily, I got up on deck since I was the deck below and I could see we were about 10 feet apart, but never did touch.

04:37.282 --> 04:43.168
But we had to stay there for 10 days to get somebody to us.

04:43.228 --> 04:44.850
In fact, the storm went on for about

04:45.286 --> 04:47.710
Another six days until the hurricane all passed.

04:48.572 --> 04:50.114
It was really a joy ride there.

04:51.837 --> 04:55.824
You were just alone, just at the whim of the storm.

04:55.985 --> 04:57.427
It went on, of course.

04:57.447 --> 05:05.181
First thing I thought, well, we're really good submarine bait, but we were small and insignificant compared to the forces that were going on to Europe.

05:05.421 --> 05:06.724
Right.

05:06.744 --> 05:09.268
But our ship, they towed it.

05:10.177 --> 05:18.149
They found out there wasn't dry dock facilities for it, which was necessary to get all this taken care of, and they sent us to Puerto Rico.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.374
They told you, this Navy tug told you to Puerto Rico.

05:21.394 --> 05:23.417
The large Navy tug told us all the way.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.280
That was a long trip.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.124
It was a couple of weeks getting us there.

05:28.464 --> 05:28.705
Right.

05:29.706 --> 05:32.571
And then we were there about six weeks.

05:33.592 --> 05:35.475
Waiting for your boat to get finished.

05:36.012 --> 05:44.722
When that was done, then we took off for the Panama Canal, and I didn't know where since my job was in the engine room, but I took off Pacific then.

05:44.922 --> 05:45.583
Right.

05:45.603 --> 05:53.952
Of course, later you would, we'll talk about this, later your career would be in landscape architecture, so when you were in Puerto Rico, that was kind of a nice place to be for your interest, right?

05:54.052 --> 05:55.694
Yeah, I enjoyed it fine.

05:57.396 --> 06:02.442
I had a lot of great experiences to see in all these plants that I'd been reading about, even

06:03.181 --> 06:06.048
at that time that we didn't grow in Texas.

06:06.068 --> 06:09.756
So I enjoyed it there.

06:10.638 --> 06:17.614
And the only problem is we hadn't gotten paid in about three months.

06:18.255 --> 06:21.122
And it was about three months later before we ever got paid.

06:21.406 --> 06:23.649
We had to do things we didn't spend money on.

06:23.789 --> 06:27.474
And we enjoyed that.

06:28.755 --> 06:33.902
So you had 10 days at sea, then towed to Puerto Rico about another six weeks there.

06:34.422 --> 06:36.325
And then your deployment completely changed.

06:36.345 --> 06:37.526
You weren't going to Europe anymore.

06:37.767 --> 06:38.788
Right.

06:39.048 --> 06:42.393
Whatever it was, we were sent through the Panama Canal.

06:43.854 --> 06:49.101
And I had to wait a few days after we got to the entrance.

06:49.553 --> 06:51.154
before our time came to go through.

06:52.616 --> 07:02.345
And after we got through, then we took off and ended up eventually in San Francisco before we were sent on out to Hawaii the first time.

07:02.545 --> 07:17.839
Interesting thing coming up from the Panama Canal one evening, a Mexican fisherman had a whole load of fish, I guess, but he was up in the deck

07:18.258 --> 07:41.312
lay in a piston and my captain thought he was disabled so we took him in tow and towed him all night long the next morning we were just entering the san diego bay the guy came up waving his engine was running found out that was a con deal so fish one did he got a free ride all night asleep but he pulled up and gave us three great big tuna fish for

07:41.461 --> 07:45.370
For letting him con you, right?

07:45.611 --> 07:46.252
Yeah.

07:46.272 --> 07:47.595
Well, that wasn't a bad trade-off.

07:47.615 --> 07:49.680
No, for us it wasn't.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.549
You said that one time you thought that you'd encountered an enemy sub, but it turned out not to be that.

07:53.649 --> 07:56.656
No, we made one run.

07:56.676 --> 07:57.799
The incidents were like a

07:58.690 --> 08:11.427
Lieutenant second class and they make a lot of mistakes and he thought we had a sub and we really made a raid on it, shot our depth charges and hedgehogs and all that stuff.

08:12.849 --> 08:16.494
I look back and we saw we sunk a half submerged barrel.

08:17.555 --> 08:18.557
But you blew the heck out of it.

08:18.577 --> 08:20.099
We got the experience anyway.

08:20.119 --> 08:24.124
That's right, you got some good target practice on that.

08:25.133 --> 08:33.464
One thing, and you may have mentioned this before, you did to me, was that through all of this, this was a good deployment for you because you didn't get seasick.

08:34.125 --> 08:34.606
Never did.

08:34.646 --> 08:37.530
Even in the 10 days at sea?

08:37.550 --> 08:37.770
No.

08:38.531 --> 08:43.157
That was going to serve you well later on because you'd get some pretty rough waters later on.

08:43.177 --> 08:44.459
For some reason, I don't know why.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.666
We were in a lot of bad water later on.

08:49.686 --> 08:49.926
Yeah.

08:50.260 --> 08:54.328
Well, you're spending nearly four years in the water, so that's good for you.

08:55.070 --> 08:59.900
Talk about your assignment to Alaska and sort of what it involved.

08:59.980 --> 09:06.092
Obviously, people know that it was the Navy Seabees' job to build stuff for the war, whether they be

09:06.494 --> 09:10.599
runways or whatever they were for World War II.

09:10.659 --> 09:13.803
And one of the things that they built were these Loran stations.

09:13.863 --> 09:20.371
Talk about what is a Loran station and what your all's duty was as far as supplying these.

09:20.391 --> 09:23.495
Well, that was the first radio directional station.

09:24.276 --> 09:25.437
Any kind of thing.

09:25.477 --> 09:26.799
It's like a microwave.

09:26.879 --> 09:30.203
It was an early microwave thing that were built.

09:30.363 --> 09:34.628
And those were going to be used for us for Dulo and all those that

09:35.182 --> 09:36.344
when they bombed Japan.

09:37.465 --> 09:48.761
And we had a whole series of those on out in Alaska, out in the middle of the Gulf, and then on up out on more of the islands.

09:48.881 --> 09:54.589
And then we built one up between the Russia and the United States on the Pribilof Island.

09:55.691 --> 10:03.301
And so we were supplying them because they were alone, these guys that were doing that work.

10:03.382 --> 10:05.104
And they worked through the winter

10:06.147 --> 10:15.600
I never did ever see what the temperature was, but I know the seawater was freezing and we were told if we hit the water it would maybe last a minute

10:16.087 --> 10:16.447
Right.

10:16.608 --> 10:17.428
Because it's that cold.

10:17.769 --> 10:18.069
Right.

10:19.771 --> 10:22.053
But I never thought we had a job to do.

10:22.073 --> 10:23.034
I never thought about that.

10:23.234 --> 10:28.300
You were talking about one crew of sea bees that you encountered that you had something that they really wanted.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.401
It was amazing.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.141
We came in.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.243
We had a sea.

10:31.823 --> 10:33.285
We were also an icebreaker.

10:33.405 --> 10:36.288
We could go through about three foot of ice.

10:36.448 --> 10:41.453
In fact, they're still using those old ships today to cleat the oil fields.

10:41.720 --> 11:08.453
up the oil fields north of alaska now right the navy has a large uh um nuclear one that does the heavy work and then those others just keep going back keeping it clear so they get in but we had supply this autumn privilof islands that's halfway between russia united states way up north i don't know how cold it was but we had to break ice to get in there and i took the barge in

11:09.192 --> 11:13.417
was loaded with supplies and on top of it were some crates of oranges.

11:14.618 --> 11:17.922
And the poor guys had been working there all winter.

11:17.942 --> 11:23.147
I don't know whether they were out of supplies, but they sure hadn't had anything for citrus or anything like that.

11:23.168 --> 11:34.440
They saw those oranges, they reached down, jumped aboard and just those wooden crates of orange, like they just tore them apart and started eating oranges, peeling seeds and all because they hadn't had anything.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.833
and they were almost the point of scurvy.

11:37.353 --> 11:42.140
So the vitamin C involved was something that they wanted.

11:42.421 --> 11:50.231
It was quite an experience there to see nature at work with all the seals and sea lions.

11:50.852 --> 11:52.134
You could just walk out among them.

11:52.815 --> 11:58.944
You were told by the Eskimos and also by the guys that were working on them not to bother them.

11:59.224 --> 12:04.191
We found out they ate them all the time, but they would grab one of them's ear and go behind

12:04.863 --> 12:07.665
kind of a doom there, then club it to kill it.

12:07.685 --> 12:12.930
They never let any of the population see them kill another animal.

12:13.210 --> 12:13.470
Right.

12:14.211 --> 12:17.514
So they were all friendly, just like puppy dogs almost, those great old big things.

12:18.234 --> 12:22.838
Some of the waters that you encountered, just to say that it was rough, would be a vast understatement.

12:22.918 --> 12:27.682
I mean, the way you describe it, you're talking about 90-foot swales and things like this.

12:27.702 --> 12:32.806
To see pictures of the crab industry going on there, they lose ships every year.

12:33.927 --> 12:34.768
But we were going

12:35.474 --> 12:44.126
over one wave and down through another one with a 190 foot, 96 foot ship and 90 foot waves.

12:44.707 --> 12:46.409
Just like a roller coaster almost.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.813
Were there times you thought you'd be covered up or capsized?

12:48.893 --> 12:52.338
I mean, I know it was a great boat.

12:52.358 --> 12:54.461
It was built for that kind of abuse.

12:54.521 --> 12:56.964
We were watertight, top and bottom.

12:58.246 --> 13:02.312
And I knew we'd float, but it was really rough.

13:02.332 --> 13:03.494
There were times you had to hang on.

13:03.834 --> 13:04.435
Right.

13:05.596 --> 13:08.641
My problem is that I got hungry and nobody else did.

13:09.943 --> 13:11.246
Because you weren't getting seasick.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.428
No, I wasn't getting seasick.

13:12.488 --> 13:23.046
I finally got the cook out of bed and he came up to the galley and he got a can of tomatoes and some saltine crackers and threw him at me and he said, if you can have that, I ain't coming back.

13:24.368 --> 13:28.515
And that's what I had to eat for about five or six days.

13:28.546 --> 13:36.194
Now you told me one time about that the bramble went the wrong side of a buoy and hit a boulder, cut a hole in it.

13:36.214 --> 13:37.636
You had just gotten off duty.

13:38.177 --> 13:40.839
And this was during the cold time, right?

13:40.859 --> 13:41.640
In the winter time.

13:41.680 --> 13:52.252
We had gone back to Kitchikan to get supplies and going north in probably an area that ships don't go now because it was smaller.

13:52.272 --> 13:55.656
It's like going between a mountain and on waterways.

13:56.677 --> 13:57.878
Again, this...

13:59.309 --> 14:05.997
A lieutenant read the buoy wrong and went the wrong way and hit a giant boulder.

14:06.758 --> 14:15.067
Then we knocked a hole about big enough to drive a car through in our main freight area.

14:15.468 --> 14:19.692
The captain, I had just gone to bed.

14:19.712 --> 14:22.496
I'd been on duty all night in the engine room.

14:22.516 --> 14:25.519
And so abandoned ship came on.

14:26.107 --> 14:35.984
And I ran up on the deck and came out the hatch on the deck and my feet just froze to the deck because it was probably 30 or 40 degrees below zero.

14:37.346 --> 14:38.187
Right.

14:38.208 --> 14:38.949
You were barefooted?

14:38.969 --> 14:39.390
Barefooted.

14:39.410 --> 14:40.672
Yeah, because you just got off duty.

14:40.692 --> 14:41.453
I just had skivvies on.

14:41.473 --> 14:42.034
Yeah, that's right.

14:42.074 --> 14:43.697
You were in for the night.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.820
I didn't know what was going on.

14:45.941 --> 14:47.924
Something was going on.

14:47.984 --> 14:49.807
I felt the big hit.

14:50.068 --> 14:50.308
Well...

14:51.149 --> 14:56.039
Captain happened to be on the bridge way up above me and he saw me and says, Smitty, stand there, don't move.

14:56.079 --> 14:57.922
And he threw me down his heavy parker.

14:59.085 --> 15:07.301
And he said, put that on and don't move until you feel your feet give way and then jump over on the piling and we'll get you then.

15:07.321 --> 15:13.613
And lucky they were able to fix the hatches that were exposed.

15:14.352 --> 15:17.455
have to hold back the water with some extra board.

15:18.115 --> 15:20.097
It didn't break through into other parts of the ship.

15:20.857 --> 15:25.922
And we went back in Canada to a dry dock there to get that.

15:26.482 --> 15:30.345
Because if you tried to break loose in that situation, you might have ripped your feet off.

15:30.365 --> 15:31.526
And pulled all the skin off.

15:31.546 --> 15:32.787
All the skin, yeah.

15:33.368 --> 15:35.109
So that was good advice.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.411
Yeah, very good.

15:36.491 --> 15:42.696
Yeah, because I could see a panic sort of coming in when you're like that.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.157
Yeah.

15:45.301 --> 15:50.749
The base in Seward, Alaska, that was in the Western Gulf, and you were the only military there, right?

15:51.070 --> 16:13.823
Yeah, they had thought Japan was going to try to come overland, and they did, but at the time we got to Alaska, they were still fighting out on the Aleutians driving them out, which we lost thousands of people, young men out there, because the Japanese weren't prepared for winter, and our guys weren't either, and they were fighting in that kind of weather.

16:14.883 --> 16:20.673
finally the Japanese just left and we moved right behind them so we could build Loran stations.

16:21.654 --> 16:32.993
Let's go to some pictures that you have supplied and some other pictures that we got off of the United States Coast Guard website and let's go to some pictures and there's

16:33.226 --> 16:35.490
There's a young one.

16:36.571 --> 16:37.072
How old were you?

16:37.092 --> 16:38.054
You were a teenager, right?

16:38.254 --> 16:40.858
I had turned 18 just before I went in the service.

16:41.439 --> 16:43.603
So that was my first leave in San Francisco.

16:43.843 --> 16:46.247
Went into the studio so I could get my mama a picture.

16:48.430 --> 16:50.313
That's good.

16:50.334 --> 16:51.535
You talked about the fishing.

16:52.116 --> 16:52.858
This is a halibut?

16:53.138 --> 16:54.240
Yeah, a halibut.

16:54.520 --> 16:59.368
We didn't have anyone supplying us.

16:59.534 --> 17:04.001
A captain was not a GI, really a GI, so we learned to hunt and fish.

17:04.481 --> 17:04.762
Right.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.025
We caught halibut salmon.

17:08.227 --> 17:12.974
We made our own fishing gear out of welding rods.

17:13.014 --> 17:16.679
We could throw them across streams and pull in, catch three-foot salmon.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.682
And that's a relatively small one right there.

17:18.782 --> 17:24.791
That one, I had some that'd be almost as tall as me, and we caught these right off the ship while we were docked there in Seward.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.575
And that's you, the proud fisherman there behind it.

17:27.595 --> 17:28.697
One day we caught it.

17:29.217 --> 17:31.701
They called it an electronic evil or something like that.

17:32.102 --> 17:33.524
It was about 12 feet long.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.387
I caught it and got it up on the deck.

17:36.809 --> 17:39.253
And all of a sudden that thing took out of us like a snake.

17:40.154 --> 17:45.663
Luckily the captain happened to see us and he's the only one who had a pistol and he took care of its part.

17:45.683 --> 17:47.926
But it had fangs like everything.

17:48.307 --> 17:50.410
But we got to hunt and fish.

17:52.914 --> 17:56.119
We didn't have a vehicle except there was one

17:56.386 --> 18:05.281
little bar in town and he had a jeep that let us bar it sometime because we were the only people, the only customers.

18:05.301 --> 18:09.027
There's a picture that you have in your album of the Bramble.

18:09.207 --> 18:12.012
Later on we've got a little bit more modern pictures of the same boat.

18:13.094 --> 18:13.995
It was heavily built.

18:14.055 --> 18:15.137
It had a double

18:15.556 --> 18:18.743
keel in the front so you could run up on ice and crush the ice.

18:18.844 --> 18:21.449
That's the way an icebreaker works.

18:21.931 --> 18:24.737
And so you had a double keel to run up on.

18:25.940 --> 18:29.548
Our fastest speed was about 12 miles an hour.

18:29.832 --> 18:32.236
We went a lot of places at 12 miles an hour.

18:32.576 --> 18:33.537
Here you are hard at work.

18:33.557 --> 18:34.258
Is that you in the middle?

18:34.559 --> 18:35.620
Oh, yeah.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.442
That's in Waikiki.

18:36.462 --> 18:39.827
Waikiki Beach right in front of the old pink hotel there.

18:39.867 --> 18:40.207
Right.

18:41.209 --> 18:41.649
Back there.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.273
Just before we took off for Alaska, we stopped there.

18:44.353 --> 18:47.438
Well, we made one run out of there south to the equator.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.562
That's probably the warmest you were for the next several years right there.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.806
This one run we made right quick.

18:52.846 --> 18:53.747
It was a whole...

18:54.655 --> 19:03.871
Our whole ship was loaded with beer for those working to shoot the atomic bomb off down there.

19:03.991 --> 19:05.474
You were a popular ship.

19:05.494 --> 19:07.177
Yeah, they were glad to see us.

19:07.918 --> 19:10.662
And there's two pictures side by side.

19:11.243 --> 19:11.684
The bow.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.367
The other front there.

19:13.487 --> 19:17.314
And at times that whole front would just go underneath the wave.

19:17.715 --> 19:19.718
We'd just float like a cork.

19:19.934 --> 19:26.241
come up and go like a roller coaster down the next wave.

19:27.603 --> 19:28.844
Good thing you didn't get seasick.

19:28.944 --> 19:31.287
It would have been a rough tour of duty.

19:31.907 --> 19:44.001
Everyone some way got up to take their duty because we had to keep going to supply these people and it was like they're all winter months and the winter months are about

19:44.487 --> 19:45.949
nine months long up there.

19:47.672 --> 19:56.684
I told you, the little lady that had a garden right next to where we usually dock, I saw her planting potatoes, orange potatoes, where you cut a potato and plant it.

19:56.844 --> 19:59.809
And we were gone about six weeks and came back.

20:00.069 --> 20:02.593
And she was harvesting potatoes.

20:02.613 --> 20:08.221
And I got to talk to her because she helped us in the USO that we established there.

20:08.881 --> 20:12.807
They were about, almost some of them a foot around in six weeks' time.

20:12.787 --> 20:15.694
And I asked her about, make a lot of good fried potatoes.

20:15.854 --> 20:17.037
She said, no, you can't fry them.

20:17.057 --> 20:18.620
They're so full of water.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.289
We just have to bake them and mash them and do them that way.

20:22.349 --> 20:26.879
But they're very, you know, they're summer just so short, everything grows fast.

20:27.019 --> 20:27.881
Exactly.

20:27.901 --> 20:28.362
Exactly.

20:28.864 --> 20:29.244
Exactly.

20:30.728 --> 20:31.690
This was, uh,

20:32.682 --> 20:34.144
You're there in the front.

20:34.224 --> 20:35.426
That was our leisure time.

20:35.446 --> 20:36.188
That was your leisure time.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.994
Since we were at sea, that was our nightlife, our daylife.

20:40.114 --> 20:40.594
Right.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.616
That's when we were off duty.

20:42.477 --> 20:42.638
Right.

20:42.658 --> 20:42.838
Okay.

20:42.898 --> 20:46.023
But we'd be seeing sharks, all kinds of things.

20:46.103 --> 20:46.904
Yeah, whales.

20:47.005 --> 20:50.049
All kinds of whales up there.

20:50.150 --> 20:56.800
I got to go up to Alaska on a cruise a couple of years ago, so I got a little taste of what you got to see all the time.

20:57.674 --> 21:02.302
Now, this is one of the photos that I got off of the Coast Guard website.

21:02.602 --> 21:04.084
This is the bramble right there.

21:04.185 --> 21:07.650
And you can see its ability to cut right through the ice.

21:07.690 --> 21:11.617
Now, those are just little ice cubes compared to some of the stuff that you cut through.

21:11.697 --> 21:12.138
Oh, yeah.

21:12.298 --> 21:12.999
It was solid.

21:13.059 --> 21:13.780
That's easy stuff.

21:13.900 --> 21:14.982
We could go through solid.

21:15.022 --> 21:17.066
If it was three foot thick, we could break through it.

21:18.027 --> 21:24.137
Had such a giant, large, looked like it was all brass propeller in the back, probably about

21:24.725 --> 21:26.347
I don't know, 12 foot in diameter.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.330
And it would just chew up the ice behind us then.

21:29.350 --> 21:33.875
So we left a Navajo trail when we went through there.

21:33.895 --> 21:39.100
It was like a blender in the way it worked.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.902
There's another photograph of it.

21:40.922 --> 21:42.824
That's probably when it was reconditioned some.

21:42.844 --> 21:47.029
They took some of the towers there at the head off of it.

21:47.049 --> 21:51.694
It slowed us down, I'm sure.

21:52.535 --> 21:53.116
Quite a vessel.

21:53.777 --> 22:02.268
It was so heavily built, heavier steel than most ships because it had to withstand all that ice pressure there.

22:03.730 --> 22:04.811
Right.

22:06.433 --> 22:10.558
And this was, you said that you're in this picture, you're in the top row of the far right.

22:10.578 --> 22:11.179
Yeah, top right.

22:12.361 --> 22:15.705
We were celebrating a victory over Europe day.

22:15.925 --> 22:16.746
Right.

22:16.767 --> 22:19.470
We'd gotten word, finally, we didn't have

22:20.176 --> 22:40.032
radios to listen to or even newspapers to get and finally the captain some way found out or they told us when we came into the dock in Seward about we'd had victory in Europe and that's our crew we all were celebrating.

22:40.512 --> 22:41.374
Celebrating that.

22:42.063 --> 22:43.325
Got a couple of pictures here.

22:43.405 --> 22:47.692
This is an example of one of the Loran stations.

22:48.594 --> 22:50.697
You may or may not have worked on this station.

22:50.717 --> 22:51.278
You worked on a while.

22:51.298 --> 22:51.519
I'm sure.

22:51.579 --> 22:54.844
That looks like going out the illusion chain.

22:54.864 --> 22:57.228
There were a lot of volcanoes working off.

22:57.689 --> 23:01.816
I told you one day we went through a volcano that was really going off and so much ash.

23:02.717 --> 23:07.986
We thought it stopped up our engines, but when I got down into the bottom of the belge of the ship to undo our

23:08.590 --> 23:12.460
Filters opened it up and it was packed full of sardines.

23:12.500 --> 23:17.693
We'd run through a school of sardines and it sucked them in and it actually would stop the ship.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.601
We couldn't cool the engines down anymore.

23:21.162 --> 23:25.333
So we had a ship full of sardines to clean up after that.

23:25.567 --> 23:26.708
There's the same station.

23:27.089 --> 23:32.014
This particular one is at an island called Uta, U-T-T-A, part of the Aleutians.

23:32.134 --> 23:32.975
That looks like them.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.556
You don't have palm trees there.

23:34.677 --> 23:35.157
Exactly.

23:35.998 --> 23:36.398
At all.

23:36.899 --> 23:37.520
Yeah, yeah.

23:37.540 --> 23:38.701
It's frozen most of the time.

23:38.881 --> 23:39.382
That's true.

23:39.962 --> 23:47.790
So that's an example of these Aloran stations that you supplied the Seabees as they built them.

23:47.810 --> 23:55.118
About the time that you got the last one built, you and things were headed for Japan for what was anticipated, a ground war.

23:55.503 --> 23:58.407
That's when the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

23:58.427 --> 24:05.656
Yeah, we had left Alaska and were going back to Honolulu for whatever.

24:06.077 --> 24:06.618
Right.

24:06.638 --> 24:07.839
To catch up with them probably.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.501
Right.

24:09.522 --> 24:17.732
And the war had gotten stopped because the bomb had been dropped by the time we went from Aleutians down to Honolulu.

24:17.993 --> 24:19.314
Right.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.257
And so I'd been in there long enough that I got

24:21.946 --> 24:24.288
I was ready to go home to Mama pretty quick.

24:24.608 --> 24:26.110
And I got mustered out pretty soon.

24:26.550 --> 24:29.092
My ship went on that time.

24:29.152 --> 24:48.129
I knew it was going on to Singapore to reset all the buoys, because we had a big boom that could lift 100,000 pounds and pull these deep sea buoys off the bottom of the ocean, because it had grown with all the growth to where it almost sunk the ship.

24:48.149 --> 24:51.852
We did some going up the coast in the United States.

24:52.388 --> 25:02.439
That was my job to run that thing, and we'd turn that ship almost to where the kennel was, down to the water for it to break loose, and it was just like a big top when it did break loose.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.020
Right.

25:03.040 --> 25:10.769
Because it was stuck to the bottom with all this growth from that, and they went on, but I said I was ready to go home to Mama.

25:10.869 --> 25:16.135
They did offer me to send me back to Coast Guard Academy for a full career.

25:16.452 --> 25:18.294
But I hadn't seen Mama in four years.

25:18.354 --> 25:19.775
I was ready to go.

25:19.795 --> 25:22.438
So in 1945, you did go back home to Wichita Falls.

25:22.558 --> 25:25.621
And you wanted to go to school to study landscape architecture.

25:26.021 --> 25:28.183
A&M didn't have such a program at the time, right?

25:28.344 --> 25:29.765
They didn't have professors at that time.

25:29.785 --> 25:30.045
Right.

25:30.125 --> 25:32.327
So you went to the University of Oklahoma for a small time.

25:32.348 --> 25:32.928
My best friend.

25:33.288 --> 25:34.450
I thought he was my best friend.

25:36.031 --> 25:37.873
Was going to the University of Oklahoma.

25:37.893 --> 25:45.160
So I went with him up there and happened to meet an Aggie up there that was going to be head of the department that the University of Oklahoma was going to

25:45.612 --> 25:48.296
And he taught me just going ahead and enrolling, which I did.

25:49.098 --> 25:49.218
Right.

25:49.238 --> 25:51.622
But about the middle of the year, they decided not to.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.086
So I packed up and headed for A&M.

25:54.206 --> 25:54.787
Headed for A&M.

25:54.987 --> 25:55.127
Yeah.

25:55.628 --> 26:00.977
And you came down and, of course, having already served, you had the option of whether to be in the Corps or not.

26:01.478 --> 26:07.487
But you decided to enter the Corps and you got a regular Army commission and were captain in the reserve, right?

26:07.527 --> 26:11.113
Since it was midterm, well, they housed us in the Corps.

26:11.431 --> 26:14.274
dorms because that's all the room they had.

26:14.314 --> 26:26.829
And since I've been in the Corps, they offered me that and I could get a regular army commission too, which gave a little extra money beside the GI thing there.

26:26.849 --> 26:31.574
So I had more money in my pocket than I've ever had in my life, which is probably 10 or $15 a month.

26:31.714 --> 26:41.185
But I enjoyed the Corps and ended up commanding officer of our unit on the senior year.

26:41.418 --> 26:45.550
They accepted, the young guys accepted the veterans fine.

26:45.650 --> 26:55.258
And since we've been in leadership for more than what most of them had, we seemed to filter up into that.

26:55.278 --> 26:56.642
So we enjoyed that very much.

26:57.213 --> 27:07.751
We're just about out of time, but after you graduated from Texas A&M, you went into your dad's business and the family landscape business and kept that going as a matter of fact.

27:08.031 --> 27:13.180
Hill Country Landscapes in Austin, you owned and operated that and your son still does, right?

27:13.160 --> 27:15.602
I got out of town so he could run the business.

27:15.662 --> 27:18.365
I found out that's what dads have to do sometimes.

27:18.385 --> 27:19.926
So I'm having fun at A&M again.

27:20.367 --> 27:20.927
Exactly.

27:21.027 --> 27:21.448
Exactly.

27:21.568 --> 27:21.948
You are.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.311
And you also worked for the highway department.

27:24.331 --> 27:29.676
You had a lot to do with when we go down the highway and we see these roadside parks with the teepees and things like that.

27:29.696 --> 27:31.798
You had a lot to do with construction and making them.

27:31.818 --> 27:38.404
When we built the interstates, I was a landscape architect with the highway department and designed the roadside parks.

27:40.686 --> 27:42.728
Before that, I was a landscape architect.

27:42.708 --> 27:49.196
For the city of Austin, I did work along Town Lake and built a botanical garden at Joker Park.

27:49.597 --> 27:49.778
Right.

27:49.798 --> 27:50.803
Things that are still going.

27:51.164 --> 27:51.385
Right.

27:51.584 --> 27:53.607
It was a wonderful career, and you married Martha in 1951?

27:53.627 --> 27:57.492
Yeah, changed my life.

27:57.953 --> 27:58.734
Indeed, indeed.

27:59.395 --> 28:02.399
Well, congratulations on that, and thank you for your service.

28:02.759 --> 28:03.560
It's remarkable.

28:03.640 --> 28:08.587
I think you might be the first Coast Guard veteran that we've had on the show.

28:08.607 --> 28:09.689
It's a remarkable story.

28:09.709 --> 28:13.714
There wasn't many, and I didn't know what to expect.

28:14.035 --> 28:16.498
But in those days, we didn't question what we were going to do.

28:16.558 --> 28:17.299
We just did it.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.441
We're out of time.

28:18.461 --> 28:19.903
Thank you for your service.

28:19.923 --> 28:20.123
Thank you.

28:20.457 --> 28:21.338
Martha and C.O.

28:21.378 --> 28:27.845
Smith have been married more than 58 years now, and his is a fascinating story of his Coast Guard service near War's End.

28:27.865 --> 28:31.068
Coast Guardsmen served in every theater of operation in World War II.

28:31.528 --> 28:35.953
Many don't know that it was the Coast Guard that captured the first German prisoner of the war.

28:35.973 --> 28:36.914
We salute C.O.

28:36.934 --> 28:39.757
Smith for his service as we do all veterans.

28:39.777 --> 28:40.678
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:40.698 --> 28:49.367
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
