00:00.031 --> 00:26.055
as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:30.457 --> 00:35.507
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.527 --> 00:36.489
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.451 --> 00:50.338
Last week, Navy Seabee Mike Guidry and I shared some of the highlights of the video that he produced and filmed during his six-month tour with the 28th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, the Seabees, serving in Al-Assad, Iraq.

00:50.757 --> 00:54.080
There's more to show of these brave and dedicated men and women.

00:54.520 --> 01:02.407
As you saw last week and, well, again this week, there was a time to work and a time to laugh, and the 28th did both with gusto.

01:02.428 --> 01:06.811
Welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, EO2, Mike Guidry of College Station.

01:07.172 --> 01:09.514
Mike, we had a great time last week in some of the video.

01:09.534 --> 01:14.859
We're going to see some different things this week, some different angles that you took.

01:15.139 --> 01:18.342
Talk a little bit, like you did last week, sort of about this whole project.

01:18.362 --> 01:20.764
You say a lot of it was just pretty much off the cuff.

01:20.744 --> 01:24.165
But I have an idea that it was a lot of work for a guy named Mike Guidry, right?

01:25.311 --> 01:25.613
Yeah.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.088
Like I said, it was six-month deployment and

01:28.608 --> 01:33.172
You know, there were so much more ideas that we had once we started doing the skits.

01:33.192 --> 01:34.554
Like, oh, let's do this, let's do that.

01:34.854 --> 01:35.935
But we just ran out of time.

01:35.975 --> 01:36.916
You know, we were busy.

01:36.976 --> 01:44.423
I mean, it looks like it was all fun and games, but you'd think there was only three hours of footage out of thousands of hours worth of work that we actually did over there.

01:44.503 --> 01:45.244
Right, right, right.

01:45.264 --> 01:48.647
When you didn't have your camera in hand, it was all work.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.849
You know, we get to see a lot of the humor of it right now.

01:51.109 --> 01:53.312
Let's go ahead and get right to it, as a matter of fact.

01:53.832 --> 01:56.995
This first segment that we're going to see, this is, we're going to back...

01:56.975 --> 02:07.875
track a little bit from where we ended last week and get to the departure to Al-Assad, sort of the packing and this massive troop plane, I guess, that you all went over on.

02:07.975 --> 02:09.578
It's very, very impressive.

02:09.598 --> 02:10.359
That's a big airplane.

02:10.379 --> 02:12.243
That's a C-17 Globemaster III.

02:12.543 --> 02:12.743
Wow.

02:12.763 --> 02:13.745
That's what that is.

02:13.765 --> 02:20.317
You're going to get a good look at it and you're going to get sort of the look, the face of the men and the women going off to war.

02:20.838 --> 02:21.379
Here we go.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.169
Right now, we're getting ready to mount out.

02:39.189 --> 02:43.560
You can see the Third Country Nationals are help loading the 463L pallets with all the seat bags.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.708
As we get through here, we'll go out to the landing strip to go.

02:46.828 --> 02:49.054
Just have to eat now with cargo nets.

03:08.980 --> 03:22.787
We'll be leaving shortly.

04:22.302 --> 04:23.083
Very impressive.

04:23.143 --> 04:27.891
Like we were just talking that particular flight that they just went on was not a particularly long flight.

04:27.911 --> 04:31.216
And that's good because that was close quarters with a lot of equipment on, right?

04:31.436 --> 04:32.017
Oh yes.

04:32.037 --> 04:32.258
Yeah.

04:32.278 --> 04:36.925
That was the most comfortable fly I've ever been on compared to any commercial flight and fast too.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.407
When you take off, it's like a roller coaster.

04:38.427 --> 04:39.509
That thing just shot off.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.210
It was up in the air.

04:40.190 --> 04:43.956
About a 45-minute flight from Kuwait, Ali Al-Saleen to Al-Asad.

04:44.197 --> 04:45.419
To Al-Asad, Al-Asad.

04:45.840 --> 04:51.710
The next one we're going to see, this is kind of, this is the longest segment that we have of the two weeks of this feature.

04:52.171 --> 04:55.657
We're going to start off with a sort of a skit that really didn't start off to be a skit.

04:55.697 --> 04:57.179
It turned into one with the armory.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.363
But then...

04:59.343 --> 05:08.191
a segment that I call convoy, which really gives us a good look at the equipment, the vehicles, just the massive amount of equipment.

05:08.211 --> 05:13.016
And this is just from one unit, just from the 28th and the Marine attachment with you.

05:13.036 --> 05:16.619
And what's the gentleman's name that's going to be introducing this convoy and talking about?

05:16.639 --> 05:18.741
Introducing this is going to be our Echo Company commander.

05:18.781 --> 05:20.122
It'll be Lieutenant Sagittano.

05:20.142 --> 05:23.305
He's also our S-7, which is our training officer.

05:23.385 --> 05:27.049
He expertly led this entire evolution as far as the convoys were concerned.

05:27.329 --> 05:28.590
Then he had two company

05:28.570 --> 05:36.001
commanders that were beneath him that were chiefs, that there was two different convoy elements that went out there through Al-Assad and Camp Fallujah.

05:36.722 --> 05:40.027
This segment will include both video and slides.

05:40.087 --> 05:44.594
You'll take a ride through the small towns of Iraq and really get a face for this war.

05:44.674 --> 05:46.377
So let's go ahead and get to it right now.

05:48.483 --> 05:49.084
Good afternoon.

05:49.104 --> 05:50.985
My name is Lieutenant Brendan Herring.

05:51.006 --> 05:54.309
I'm the weapons and ordnance officer for Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 28.

05:54.329 --> 05:57.972
I also help in the Unit Movement Control Center with the air movement.

05:58.273 --> 05:59.274
I'm an Air Force officer.

05:59.594 --> 06:01.396
I've been in the Air Force coming up on two years.

06:01.476 --> 06:03.958
I've been with the battalion about five months.

06:03.978 --> 06:17.612
My job here in the Armory is to make sure that the battalion, and especially the combat security elements, are prepared and ready to go with all the weaponry and ordnance they need to carry out their mission, and also whenever we send groups out on projects that they're prepared to handle whatever threats may emerge.

06:18.031 --> 06:24.319
So come on in and we'll go ahead and show you around the armory and introduce you to the folks that work here and show you a little bit about what we do.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.221
This is the inside of the armory.

06:26.702 --> 06:28.163
This is where it all goes down.

06:28.684 --> 06:32.909
As you can see over here, we've got Connex boxes where we store weapons for the convoy security elements.

06:33.410 --> 06:34.411
More storage over here.

06:34.932 --> 06:40.258
Back behind you, we've got the ammunition storage point where we keep all of our explosives.

06:40.525 --> 06:47.955
Over here we've got people using the armory to clean their weapons, which is an essential function when in a desert environment such as Iraq.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.698
So we encourage people to spend as much time as they can in there.

06:50.898 --> 06:51.720
Is that carbon?

06:52.080 --> 06:52.501
Carbon!

06:52.521 --> 06:53.762
There's carbon right there!

06:53.962 --> 06:55.004
I'll do it to get it out!

06:55.024 --> 06:57.687
Get the carbon out!

06:57.707 --> 07:05.217
And my very aggressive staff making sure that people do a good job of cleaning their weapons every time they shoot and at periodic intervals to ensure readiness.

07:53.797 --> 08:04.718
Thank you.

08:22.417 --> 08:29.267
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Satchel Tano, OIC, Echo Company, and today I'm coming to you here from Al-Assad.

08:29.868 --> 08:36.437
We have one of our teams based here in Al-Assad getting ready to take off for the evening, heading out on another mission.

08:36.457 --> 08:42.406
So far, today, we have completed over 200 missions and over 20,000 miles.

08:42.706 --> 08:45.310
You see them come behind me here.

08:47.313 --> 08:49.216
They travel pretty heavy.

08:49.236 --> 08:50.938
They have crew served weapons,

08:53.467 --> 09:03.718
Big, big truck.

09:03.738 --> 09:09.725
We travel some of the toughest roads here in Iraq, protecting the convoys from enemy attack, attacks from IEDs.

09:10.145 --> 09:15.351
They look out, they protect some of the drivers and stuff that we take along with us.

09:15.611 --> 09:22.219
All along, they're out there for the safety.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.440
There's another one there.

09:25.073 --> 09:48.297
don't know where they're going now and as they continue their missions throughout here we want to thank the families who support them back home they also have support these guys would be able to concentrate and do the things that they do well here protecting our convoys vehicles

09:53.693 --> 09:56.216
that also tag along.

09:56.236 --> 10:00.782
They want to pick up some equipment tonight.

10:00.842 --> 10:02.324
That's pretty much what these guys do.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.807
They're on the roads, lots of long hours.

10:04.827 --> 10:06.789
As you can see, I got the sun setting behind me here.

10:06.830 --> 10:13.898
They mainly travel at night, so they spend a lot of time on the roads at night under the cover of darkness, which helps protect them and the convoy.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.823
And coming up behind us here is the convoy commander's platform.

10:17.843 --> 10:19.706
This is CMC Lewship.

10:19.726 --> 10:23.110
He has expertly led this convoy team in all aspects

10:31.915 --> 10:37.889
Now, much like the police forces back home, these guys are in charge with taking care of that convoy.

10:37.909 --> 10:42.159
They will stop any local national vehicles from moving into the convoy.

10:42.680 --> 10:49.516
It will help block off roads, get verbal signs, signals to them.

10:49.536 --> 10:50.278
Get a car, L.D.

10:52.115 --> 10:55.060
Finally, it ends up with one of our recovery vehicles here.

10:55.521 --> 11:01.010
Basically, they are in charge to pick up any vehicle and bring down along the route.

11:01.030 --> 11:08.402
They carry all kind of gear in the back, and that helps them at any time that they can help get the convoy moving.

11:09.665 --> 11:12.491
In closing, I'd just like to add that I'm very proud of these guys.

11:12.511 --> 11:17.881
These guys have done a really lot of hard hours, long hours on the road, a lot of hard work.

11:18.342 --> 11:26.638
So the rest of the Seabees here, we're just looking to push through, finish up this deployment, get back home safely and sound to our families.

11:26.658 --> 11:27.640
Good night.

17:08.225 --> 17:16.986
Mike, I think what you've shown us puts a face on the war that we don't normally get to see through the news clips of the TV networks and the cable networks and all that.

17:17.066 --> 17:21.036
It's just very impressive actually putting us in a tank

17:21.590 --> 17:25.174
or in a vehicle and going through the streets of Iraq.

17:25.254 --> 17:29.018
I mean, that's the way it is right there through your camera lens, right?

17:29.278 --> 17:29.758
There you go.

17:29.899 --> 17:32.661
Now, a lot of that footage wasn't shot on the convoys.

17:32.682 --> 17:33.542
That was someone else.

17:34.303 --> 17:38.528
But indeed, it's not all, you know, here you see the human factor.

17:38.548 --> 17:42.492
You know, it's like you and me, you know, being out there and, you know, they're their people.

17:42.672 --> 17:44.714
You know, it's not like what you see on the media.

17:44.954 --> 17:45.775
Right, right.

17:46.055 --> 17:46.356
Indeed.

17:46.896 --> 17:48.578
Very, very impressive.

17:48.598 --> 17:50.500
It gives people a viewpoint.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.269
that I just don't think that they get to get anywhere else.

17:53.871 --> 17:57.925
Last week we introduced the viewers to a fellow named Kevin Geegan.

17:58.462 --> 18:02.468
A guy who, for morale purposes, was obviously very, very much needed.

18:02.508 --> 18:04.751
A very funny guy, very inventive guy.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.996
Kevin, we'll see.

18:08.096 --> 18:11.361
This is going to be just sort of fun with Kevin, a segment coming up.

18:11.581 --> 18:14.365
Was he always on like this, whether the camera was on or not?

18:14.385 --> 18:17.750
Was he always joking around and doing the voices and the imitations?

18:17.770 --> 18:20.574
Kevin, I've known Kevin since 1995 when I first met him.

18:20.614 --> 18:22.977
Kevin is one of my best friends, absolutely.

18:23.298 --> 18:24.199
Will be for life.

18:24.179 --> 18:27.022
He's another native Texan.

18:27.042 --> 18:29.504
He's a Ustonian, works for Reliant Energy.

18:30.405 --> 18:35.569
And he will study people and just come up with these characters.

18:35.589 --> 18:37.070
You know, it imitates them perfectly.

18:37.571 --> 18:40.313
But when it comes down to work, he's the best man to have around.

18:40.373 --> 18:42.896
I tell you what, this guy can do it all.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.998
You know, no matter what you, whatever you need, Kevin's the guy, the go-to guy.

18:46.359 --> 18:51.783
Here's some more fun with Kevin Geegan coming up, including a segment where he's talking on his cell phone to his dog.

18:51.803 --> 18:52.604
You'll really like that.

18:52.904 --> 18:53.545
Here we go.

18:55.043 --> 18:59.769
My name is Scrappy-Doo, and I'm getting ready to get on the plane, me and my Uncle Scooby.

19:00.050 --> 19:04.556
And we've been having a whole bunch of Guinness, not beer, and we're real fired up.

19:04.856 --> 19:08.762
And I tell you what, we're going to go, and we're going to go in the old castle.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.064
These guys are laughing at me.

19:10.304 --> 19:12.106
My name is Scrappy-Doo.

19:13.328 --> 19:14.710
Puppy power.

19:14.970 --> 19:15.371
Come on.

19:15.892 --> 19:16.793
No, Scrappy, no.

19:17.253 --> 19:20.558
Uncle Scooby, let's go in that old mansion, and let's go get that ghost.

19:20.578 --> 19:21.699
One, two, three, four.

19:21.940 --> 19:23.582
I'll beat him myself.

19:23.562 --> 19:28.528
Will you go in the Old Castle for one Scooby snack?

19:29.129 --> 19:29.790
No way.

19:30.411 --> 19:31.472
Two Scooby snacks?

19:32.033 --> 19:32.534
Maybe.

19:33.094 --> 19:34.356
Three Scooby snacks?

19:34.376 --> 19:35.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:35.597 --> 19:36.839
Come on, let's go.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.504
Me and you go in the castle and give me three Scooby snacks.

19:40.724 --> 19:42.006
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:42.366 --> 19:43.908
Okay, Uncle Scooby, let's go.

19:44.929 --> 19:45.570
See you later.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.953
From Ireland, this is Scrappy-Doo.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.578
Puppy power!

19:51.845 --> 19:54.649
I'm looking for my almost goalie.

19:54.669 --> 19:56.191
Who are you?

19:56.331 --> 19:58.434
I tell you what, I'm going to get you.

19:58.454 --> 19:59.235
One, two, three.

19:59.335 --> 20:00.496
I need a scrappy dude.

20:00.516 --> 20:01.137
Let me at him.

20:01.157 --> 20:02.359
Let me at him.

20:02.479 --> 20:03.300
One, two, three.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.882
I'm going to get you.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.384
Come on, let me at him.

20:06.504 --> 20:07.746
Let me at him.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.929
I need a scrappy dude.

20:09.949 --> 20:10.810
Let me at him.

20:10.890 --> 20:11.871
One, two.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.994
Come on, come on.

20:14.074 --> 20:15.737
I'll get you on loose.

20:15.757 --> 20:16.658
One, two, three.

20:16.858 --> 20:17.839
One, two.

20:17.859 --> 20:18.821
Come on.

20:19.361 --> 20:20.603
Let me at him.

20:21.376 --> 20:22.517
Hello, everybody.

20:22.617 --> 20:31.848
I'm Barry Hollinshatt from Oklahoma, and I come on this deployment, and I learned a whole lot about billing.

20:31.868 --> 20:35.573
The only thing I really miss is I'm a cat lover.

20:35.673 --> 20:36.614
I had a cat.

20:37.295 --> 20:40.659
His name is Sniffles, and he's back home.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.741
Hello, Sniffles.

20:42.761 --> 20:43.382
Wait a minute.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.002
Wait a minute.

20:44.063 --> 20:46.185
I might be able to get him on the phone.

20:50.468 --> 20:52.770
Dad?

20:52.790 --> 20:52.970
Hey.

20:53.911 --> 20:54.832
This is Barry.

20:55.933 --> 20:58.375
Where's Sniffles?

20:58.395 --> 21:00.197
He's out.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.558
How long has he been gone?

21:03.700 --> 21:09.285
Well, I told you, Dad, to give me a call when he stays out two or three days.

21:09.305 --> 21:10.026
Where's he been?

21:11.708 --> 21:12.308
Out running.

21:13.169 --> 21:14.410
That's all right.

21:14.430 --> 21:15.191
I'll take care of him.

21:15.311 --> 21:17.793
Oh, he's coming through the door, the kitty door.

21:18.234 --> 21:19.615
OK, put him on the phone.

21:20.371 --> 21:22.533
She falls.

21:22.994 --> 21:24.255
I don't want to hear that anymore.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.999
You keep on all that, now where have you been?

21:29.441 --> 21:34.587
I told dad to tell me when you, he says you've been gone for three or four days.

21:35.828 --> 21:39.732
I'll tell you what, you won't be getting any more honey this time.

21:39.912 --> 21:45.919
I'm going out to get honey and milk all the time and all night long.

21:45.939 --> 21:47.140
And this is what you do, Turbo.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.703
You go out and stay all night.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.184
You just wait till I get home.

21:51.625 --> 21:52.746
I'm going to have you neutered.

21:53.106 --> 22:00.714
No, don't keep on... Like me, you won't be getting any more me-all mixed in.

22:00.914 --> 22:04.037
Okay, Sniffles.

22:04.057 --> 22:04.858
I've had it with you.

22:06.299 --> 22:06.559
All right.

22:07.600 --> 22:07.941
Bye.

22:09.522 --> 22:14.787
Well, sorry about that, but he gets in trouble all the time.

22:14.807 --> 22:18.711
Well, I've got to go get me a cigar Switzer Sweet.

22:19.889 --> 22:27.939
Barry Holland said, remember me, and it's been his pleasure serving with you in Iraq.

22:27.959 --> 22:34.947
Excuse me, it was his cat, not his dog, as you could finally see, and this was based on a real-life character, is that right?

22:35.027 --> 22:37.430
A real-life fellow Seabee?

22:37.831 --> 22:41.255
Yeah, this is a real person, and he would call his cat, apparently.

22:41.415 --> 22:42.716
That was Kevin.

22:43.017 --> 22:49.845
That was him, again, getting in the mind of people that he knew and developed this character, and boom, there you go.

22:51.192 --> 22:55.465
A lot of great guys there, but obviously, like you said, he was always on.

22:55.565 --> 23:00.099
So Kevin was doing this whether the camera was on him or not.

23:00.119 --> 23:03.168
Definitely, like you said, a morale booster that they really needed out there.

23:04.031 --> 23:04.392
Indeed.

23:04.962 --> 23:07.025
Y'all are obviously back home now.

23:07.065 --> 23:08.968
This is after the deployment.

23:09.108 --> 23:18.161
As a matter of fact, that last segment that we saw was at a change of command ceremony, which was also part of your two-hour video, which I wish we had had time to show that whole thing.

23:18.221 --> 23:19.884
It was very, very impressive.

23:19.904 --> 23:22.768
But your commander, who we have seen, the commander of Chardon.

23:22.748 --> 23:26.373
Impressive gentleman, obviously.

23:26.393 --> 23:28.536
Yes, I cannot say enough about the man.

23:29.257 --> 23:30.939
He's become a very close friend of mine.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.361
He lives in Katy, Texas.

23:32.902 --> 23:37.108
Just saw him last weekend, actually, and he's asking about my wife, Audrey.

23:38.309 --> 23:45.619
He has so much in your personal life, but he is one of the sole reasons why we all came home.

23:45.679 --> 23:47.021
I mean, everybody washed their backs.

23:47.061 --> 23:50.646
It was their own personal...

23:50.795 --> 23:56.625
whatever you call it, so that they all came home safely, but yet he had so much more to do with it.

23:56.645 --> 23:57.467
Absolutely.

23:57.487 --> 23:57.767
Indeed.

23:58.448 --> 24:06.863
Last segment is a short one, but you can definitely tell that Mike Guidry is home because this is just a little short video

24:06.843 --> 24:14.540
of being home right here in College Station at the George Bush Library in a very special sort of impromptu greeting.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.968
Actually, this was an old footage of UPD back in UPD days.

24:18.008 --> 24:18.529
I'm sorry.

24:18.549 --> 24:19.391
Okay, that's okay.

24:19.431 --> 24:21.415
It is an old footage, but it is still back home.

24:21.455 --> 24:22.277
But I wanted to show this.

24:22.638 --> 24:24.462
And then the end of the video, the light's out.

24:24.562 --> 24:25.003
Here we go.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.767
Nice to see you.

24:29.787 --> 24:30.128
You get it?

24:30.409 --> 24:30.790
Yes, sir.

24:30.951 --> 24:31.874
He's doing a good job.

24:32.476 --> 24:33.299
Guidry himself.

24:33.761 --> 24:37.393
One of the great officers is named Guidry, and he's doing a fine job here.

24:37.513 --> 24:38.738
I'd like you to know that.

24:38.758 --> 24:40.022
We'll see you.

25:06.023 --> 25:19.309
Again, that was taken earlier, the part with President Bush, when, like we talked about in our first show, when you were an employee of UPD, where you were there for quite a while, and the light's out.

25:19.530 --> 25:21.474
Mike, just a tremendous video.

25:21.494 --> 25:26.243
I wish everybody had a chance to see the whole two-hour video because there's a lot on it.

25:26.223 --> 25:35.131
As we mentioned a few weeks ago, you've got a deployment coming up in 2010 where you'll be going back, and this time your order is through Afghanistan, is that right?

25:35.331 --> 25:35.812
Correct.

25:35.832 --> 25:36.813
You're looking forward to that?

25:36.833 --> 25:37.713
Oh, yes.

25:37.733 --> 25:41.857
It was a good experience, and our cause is just.

25:42.438 --> 25:48.583
And even depending on who's in office, we've still got a mission to do out there, and it needs to be done.

25:48.603 --> 25:49.144
Right, right.

25:49.164 --> 25:52.607
And you're going to take your camera with you next time, and we're going to see a part two, is that right?

25:52.647 --> 25:54.428
We'll be taking a high-def camera this time.

25:54.609 --> 25:56.230
Oh, hi.

25:56.210 --> 25:57.792
Did a good job on that.

25:57.812 --> 25:58.433
Thank you.

25:58.814 --> 26:02.920
And like I say, we don't want to give people the idea that this is all he did for six months in Iraq.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.964
No, this was just a very, very small portion of it.

26:04.984 --> 26:11.233
And it certainly was something that kept up the morale of the people of the 28th Seabees.

26:11.253 --> 26:13.276
Mike Guidry, again, thank you very much for your service.

26:13.316 --> 26:15.400
And thank you for sharing the video with us.

26:15.420 --> 26:16.541
It was tremendous.

26:16.622 --> 26:18.324
And good luck to you and your wife, Audrey.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.788
And stay safe on your next deployment.

26:21.149 --> 26:21.629
Thank you, Tom.

26:21.789 --> 26:22.370
Appreciate that.

26:22.691 --> 26:23.432
Mike Guidry.

26:23.412 --> 26:29.519
Thanks to the men and the women of the 28th Seabees for putting a real face on those who served.

26:29.539 --> 26:39.330
I hope you could see what I saw in those faces, a dedication, a pride, and yes, especially on the faces of those on that plane to Iraq and uncertainty of what lay ahead.

26:39.950 --> 26:46.878
Thanks to Mike Guidry for his service and for his camera and his eye for bringing us the essence of the 28th Seabees.

26:47.779 --> 26:49.921
I'm Tom Turbiville for EO2 Mike Guidry.

26:50.002 --> 26:52.204
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
