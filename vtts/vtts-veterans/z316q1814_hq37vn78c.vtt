00:01.313 --> 00:29.955
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.975 --> 00:31.017
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.739 --> 00:37.788
The first thing that Colonel Freddy Wolters will tell you is that he never was the sort to do things by the book.

00:37.808 --> 00:51.047
Doing it his way was not always the Army's way, but his service not only to his country during World War II in the Pacific Theater, but even now with his involvement in the community speaks to his passion of patriotism.

00:51.601 --> 01:01.452
President Truman ordered the bomb dropped on Japan before his artillery unit had a chance to leave for what would have certainly been a bloody ground war in Japan.

01:01.472 --> 01:09.741
Nonetheless, he has stories of his wartime and his time at Texas A&M where he was a freshman member of Homer Norton's football team in 1940.

01:09.821 --> 01:13.365
That was the year after the national championship.

01:13.385 --> 01:16.729
Please welcome the veteran to the Valley, Colonel Freddie Wolters.

01:17.090 --> 01:21.034
Colonel Wolters, it's a great pleasure to have you here and thank you for your service first off.

01:21.402 --> 01:26.650
You grew up north of Denton on a farm during the Depression.

01:26.670 --> 01:30.155
Talk a little bit about that time growing up during the Depression.

01:30.195 --> 01:36.264
People my age, we hear about the Depression, but I don't think we really get a feel of what it was like growing up during that time.

01:36.784 --> 01:38.347
What was it like?

01:38.367 --> 01:47.680
Well, it'd be pretty hard to make people realize how really tough it was because the Depression was rough in Denton.

01:48.352 --> 01:49.834
but all over the United States.

01:49.914 --> 01:52.116
It was tough, tough, tough.

01:52.136 --> 01:55.941
And I farmed the whole year.

01:58.444 --> 02:01.067
And I ended up $56 left on a cotton crop.

02:02.328 --> 02:06.433
And I told my daddy, I said, I'm going to saddle old paint seven miles down.

02:06.453 --> 02:10.638
I'm going to town and buy every bit of it in clothes.

02:10.658 --> 02:13.341
And then when I get back, I'm going to catch the school bus.

02:13.381 --> 02:15.844
And I caught the school bus two weeks after

02:17.157 --> 02:23.226
School started and enrolled in the ninth grade without going to the eighth grade.

02:23.246 --> 02:24.267
You were a football player.

02:24.488 --> 02:27.492
The football coach kind of liked your skills on the football field.

02:27.672 --> 02:30.717
Well, that's what saved my life.

02:31.057 --> 02:31.618
Right.

02:31.778 --> 02:34.963
It kept me going because of the football coach.

02:35.568 --> 02:42.897
You went to Texas A&M in 1940, and like we said, that was the year after the 1939 national championship.

02:42.917 --> 02:46.862
So I guess Coach Homer Norton had some pretty high expectations of you all.

02:46.882 --> 02:47.703
Not necessarily.

02:48.044 --> 02:55.653
Not necessarily because he already had the national championship and had plenty of ball, and he had 144 freshmen to come out for freshman football.

02:56.515 --> 03:00.580
And he told me point blank, he said, you look like you're capable of doing it.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.402
If you can do it,

03:02.905 --> 03:07.391
What you need to do, well, then I'll take care of you.

03:07.411 --> 03:14.441
And out of the 144, there's only 24 letter sweaters.

03:14.461 --> 03:24.035
And out of those 24, there's only 14 of us got our sweaters to time, letter sweaters and track and football.

03:24.235 --> 03:24.495
Right.

03:24.656 --> 03:25.917
What positions did you play?

03:25.978 --> 03:26.679
I played in.

03:26.899 --> 03:27.119
Yeah.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.281
Both ways.

03:28.301 --> 03:29.042
Both ways, sure.

03:29.482 --> 03:31.005
In those days, you played both ways.

03:31.045 --> 03:31.565
Right.

03:31.585 --> 03:31.926
Oh, yeah.

03:32.246 --> 03:32.727
Absolutely.

03:33.550 --> 03:34.972
Now, you were the class of 1944.

03:34.992 --> 03:37.076
Yes, sir.

03:37.116 --> 03:42.946
The classes of 41, 42, and 43, they all pretty much all packed up and went to war.

03:43.086 --> 03:44.108
Yeah, that's right.

03:44.388 --> 03:52.943
They got their commission right out of A&M, so they were ready to roll, and they were the ones who took the bloody part of the war battle.

03:53.193 --> 03:57.402
But the class of 44, talk about, it was sort of scattered around, right?

03:57.743 --> 04:07.063
Class of 44 was an oddball deal because it came at the time when things were sort of rocking back and forth and didn't know what to do with it.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.548
They sent us to Camp Waters to be inducted

04:10.085 --> 04:15.130
And Men of Wales is Camp Walter, and it's a German name, W.O.

04:15.150 --> 04:23.297
And I told all the boys, and I said, look, I'm an Army, background, have respect for me, which wasn't the truth, but it made lots of fun.

04:23.377 --> 04:26.400
I think you told them that the camp was named after your uncle, right?

04:26.420 --> 04:28.982
You tried to sell them on that, right?

04:29.002 --> 04:29.142
Yeah.

04:29.162 --> 04:31.144
Well, then I came back to A&M.

04:31.164 --> 04:36.349
We came back to A&M and started school, but we didn't stay long.

04:36.629 --> 04:37.510
Right.

04:38.350 --> 04:46.858
You were shipped off 11th Armored Division, 358th Artillery, and initially you thought you were going to go to Germany.

04:46.878 --> 04:47.278
Yes, sir.

04:47.619 --> 04:49.020
But it didn't work out that way.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.421
Tell me why.

04:50.441 --> 05:03.514
Well, lots of people don't realize in those times why everybody with Japanese background in California were putting holding camps.

05:03.714 --> 05:03.954
Right.

05:04.094 --> 05:04.695
Sort of like

05:05.283 --> 05:06.544
like a temporary prison.

05:06.744 --> 05:06.985
Right.

05:07.745 --> 05:22.120
And if you, in Germany, and you're going over there, and my name is a German name, W.O., they don't know that, they didn't know that I had a mother that was a straight-laced Baptist, and I was a half-breed, but they're W.O.

05:22.821 --> 05:28.667
And the German family in Europe, right now, are the wealthy, wealthy, wealthy.

05:28.687 --> 05:34.092
They have the Wolters Brewer all across Germany, and there's multiple rich.

05:34.342 --> 05:36.706
And so that just struck a note.

05:36.726 --> 05:39.871
So the colonel said, you can't go overage.

05:39.891 --> 05:41.133
And that made me unhappy.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.677
And I wanted to know why I couldn't go.

05:44.358 --> 05:49.266
And he said, well, you're the first person I ever heard that didn't want to stay home when you had to go to war.

05:49.286 --> 05:51.810
And I said, look, my classmate's right out there now.

05:52.271 --> 05:55.657
And some of them are going to die and won't come back.

05:55.677 --> 06:00.024
And I'm entitled to go with them to do what I'm supposed to do.

06:00.044 --> 06:00.805
Well, I didn't go.

06:01.747 --> 06:03.709
Instead, you were assigned to the Pacific.

06:04.070 --> 06:08.455
You went to Seattle and from there to Hawaii.

06:09.356 --> 06:11.178
And that was kind of a rough boat ride.

06:11.358 --> 06:11.958
Yes, sir.

06:12.059 --> 06:17.805
For you and the African-American military that were under you at the time.

06:17.865 --> 06:19.066
Talk about that.

06:19.086 --> 06:22.891
Well, when you left, the ocean was thick.

06:23.912 --> 06:26.895
And we talk about a convoy of everything imaginable.

06:27.155 --> 06:29.458
It just wasn't one or two little ships that had

06:30.080 --> 06:32.543
Everything, submarines, everything.

06:33.303 --> 06:35.626
And the waves was terrible.

06:36.407 --> 06:45.596
And because I was a Texas, where the colonel who I'd never met signed me to be in charge of the troops you're talking about.

06:46.077 --> 06:52.123
And they only had one three striper over them.

06:52.143 --> 06:59.631
And he put them down in the front of the ship in a bottom hole, six down.

06:59.712 --> 07:03.697
And it wasn't but a day until they cracked the seam and the water got in there.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.520
And, of course, they got that stop.

07:06.401 --> 07:07.443
But they all came out.

07:11.268 --> 07:11.989
They were scared.

07:12.269 --> 07:12.510
Yeah.

07:12.730 --> 07:13.491
And I was scared.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.854
And you all were sick.

07:15.874 --> 07:16.255
Sir?

07:16.275 --> 07:17.717
You all were very sick, right?

07:17.837 --> 07:18.358
You were seasick.

07:18.378 --> 07:25.087
We were seasick and they were seasick and just ready to jump overboard.

07:25.267 --> 07:25.527
Right.

07:26.329 --> 07:26.769
Right.

07:26.789 --> 07:28.892
I don't think people realize seasickness...

07:29.345 --> 07:34.813
You know, you can go out on a boat for an hour and get a little nauseated, but true seasickness in a case like that.

07:34.833 --> 07:41.642
True sickness, you commit suicide if you get true sickness and can't get relief of it.

07:41.662 --> 07:41.963
Yeah.

07:41.983 --> 07:42.944
That's how bad it is.

07:43.084 --> 07:43.805
Right, right.

07:44.386 --> 07:48.252
So you went to one of your superiors and you had a little confrontation with him.

07:48.272 --> 07:48.592
Yes, sir.

07:50.415 --> 07:55.622
I went in and asked for him and he made a comment.

07:56.294 --> 07:59.418
And I told him we were all seasick and this and the other.

08:00.139 --> 08:04.805
And he made the comment, well, seasickness is fear.

08:04.825 --> 08:07.969
And that didn't go over too well with me.

08:08.069 --> 08:11.874
And I just said, sir, I want you to understand that my men are sick.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.696
And I'm seasick.

08:13.716 --> 08:15.538
And we're ready to jump overboard.

08:16.359 --> 08:21.846
But back to what you said, I am not scared of anybody that

08:22.012 --> 08:24.215
on this earth, and that includes you.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.519
Well, that sort of struck him pretty strong.

08:27.539 --> 08:30.723
And he said, well, I will see that you get some help.

08:30.743 --> 08:36.711
And he put six officers in charge, but he pointed his finger back and said, you're still going to be the boss.

08:37.452 --> 08:40.475
So he didn't give me relief, but that would make it real simple.

08:40.816 --> 08:41.116
Right.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.280
You spent three months or so in Hawaii.

08:44.561 --> 08:44.821
Yes, sir.

08:44.841 --> 08:45.362
Is that right?

08:45.542 --> 08:45.842
Yes, sir.

08:45.862 --> 08:50.348
And then you took off again to sort of parts unknown, but towards the Philippines.

08:50.885 --> 08:52.527
Well, you said Hawaii.

08:52.667 --> 08:52.808
Uh-huh.

08:52.828 --> 08:53.368
Yeah.

08:53.408 --> 08:58.155
We were in Hawaii for three months, and I had a survey team.

08:58.175 --> 09:06.125
We surveyed the pineapple patches and everything and worked our way around doing different things.

09:06.786 --> 09:15.458
But the funny thing about that deal was that we were ready to ship out from Hawaii, and they...

09:17.682 --> 09:22.246
Navy failed to put 50 armored trailers on the ship.

09:23.147 --> 09:28.312
And the colonel, there was a new colonel, came in, and he called myself as Lieutenant Booker.

09:28.912 --> 09:33.456
He was second lieutenant, and I was first lieutenant, and I was six foot, some of them, and he's five foot four.

09:33.576 --> 09:37.160
But a great Christian.

09:37.180 --> 09:37.500
Yes, sir.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.782
Never cussed or said a bad word.

09:41.463 --> 09:47.689
Called us in, and he said, I was told if you wanted to get something done, call on you two.

09:48.344 --> 09:52.711
And boy, automatically I could think of getting on a boat 666.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.917
I said, sir, we don't even know where that boat is.

09:56.438 --> 10:01.046
He said, you just get your men together, and you go down there, you'll find it.

10:01.166 --> 10:05.573
You go down there and do what it takes to get those trailers.

10:05.593 --> 10:13.727
So when I got down there, the first person I met was a guard on the end, and I said, look, I want to know what person...

10:14.720 --> 10:19.566
that I can talk to that's as tough and mean as a first sergeant in the Army.

10:20.322 --> 10:23.786
And he said, he's right down yonder, and he's mean, and he's salty.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.407
I said, that's what we're looking for.

10:25.768 --> 10:28.230
So we went down there, and he just threw a fit.

10:28.651 --> 10:30.553
He said, can you imagine what happened?

10:30.633 --> 10:35.799
All those trailers get running all over the place, and these people get killed.

10:36.339 --> 10:37.661
I said, now wait just a minute.

10:38.241 --> 10:40.824
That's your job, Navy, to get them on there.

10:40.844 --> 10:42.266
You're the one that left them off.

10:42.906 --> 10:45.469
I'm just down here to help you get them killed.

10:45.449 --> 10:47.252
straightened out.

10:47.272 --> 10:54.584
I said, you put the trailers on there and you gave me two men or three men to tell us how to tie them down.

10:55.245 --> 10:59.772
And then Sam and I had coveralls and we got it right in there with them and we tied down.

11:00.333 --> 11:07.024
Can you imagine what a chain on a Navy ship and then rust, they had rust, rust, rust, rust.

11:07.044 --> 11:07.945
So I stopped there.

11:08.907 --> 11:10.870
You got pretty dirty, pretty smelly, pretty filthy.

11:10.890 --> 11:12.312
Got pretty dirty, pretty dirty.

11:12.372 --> 11:12.773
Yeah.

11:13.276 --> 11:15.529
But then you got... Well, we work.

11:15.629 --> 11:17.580
People don't realize what we're talking about.

11:17.782 --> 11:19.270
That was the early of the morning.

11:19.908 --> 11:25.676
And the time we got in, that was afternoon, all the next day until 10 o'clock the next night.

11:26.136 --> 11:27.779
That's how we never stopped.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.401
Davey fed us.

11:29.421 --> 11:30.823
We went to the bathroom and back.

11:30.883 --> 11:33.106
But we just kept working, working, working.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.671
And Sam and I was right in there with them, just working like crazy.

11:36.691 --> 11:41.237
Because you can't tell somebody how to do something if you don't know it yourself.

11:41.597 --> 11:43.460
And we had little Army coveralls on.

11:43.980 --> 11:46.864
And all that was clean about either one of us was eyeballs.

11:47.025 --> 11:49.628
The rest of it was just rusty, rusty, rusty.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.976
The colonel was pretty proud of your work though, wasn't he?

11:52.438 --> 11:59.162
Well, when they came on, I met one major and he bawled us out.

11:59.581 --> 12:02.246
for being not representing officers.

12:02.306 --> 12:06.334
You're supposed to dress like an officer or not and clean and polite and this stuff.

12:06.955 --> 12:09.700
And I just sort of ignored him and went on with a few people.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.662
And here come the colonel.

12:10.702 --> 12:12.966
And he almost hugged us.

12:12.986 --> 12:14.328
He shook our hands.

12:14.348 --> 12:16.332
He was the proudest person you've ever seen.

12:16.973 --> 12:19.678
And I told him, I said, sir, I want to tell you something.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.201
I'm pretty unhappy.

12:21.637 --> 12:25.443
He said, what in the weather, Lieutenant Walter, what you unhappy about?

12:25.483 --> 12:26.144
And I told him.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.027
And he said, that's all right.

12:28.087 --> 12:32.334
Y'all go to your quarters and sleep and get over with it and rest it up, cleaned up.

12:32.434 --> 12:34.437
And when you get ready, come to my office.

12:34.978 --> 12:37.782
I don't care what time of day or night it is, you come to my office.

12:37.802 --> 12:39.625
And we did, like he said.

12:40.085 --> 12:41.107
And he met with the colonel.

12:41.648 --> 12:42.730
And that was the end of him.

12:42.790 --> 12:43.290
He left.

12:43.951 --> 12:46.816
He kind of dressed down the colonel pretty much.

12:46.836 --> 12:48.058
Shipped out.

12:48.078 --> 12:48.218
Indeed.

12:48.805 --> 12:52.189
You thought that you were headed to Japan for a ground war.

12:52.209 --> 12:52.610
To where?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.232
To Japan for a ground war.

12:54.292 --> 12:56.515
That's what your thought was.

12:57.036 --> 13:03.985
And I believe you had even been told that if there was a ground war in Japan, that there could be as many as a half a million deaths.

13:04.005 --> 13:05.006
That's right.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.688
Even more on the Japanese side.

13:07.009 --> 13:07.269
That's right.

13:07.289 --> 13:10.293
What were your thoughts then about the prospect of this?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.636
Well, I don't really know.

13:13.207 --> 13:18.394
You know, if you're in the service, especially if you're as honored as I am, well, you don't worry about it.

13:18.414 --> 13:21.958
You just take it, take it as it comes, and if it happens, it happens.

13:22.078 --> 13:35.836
And we weren't excited about being on a flat-bottom boat with a bulldozer sitting in front of it loaded out to go to Japan.

13:36.677 --> 13:43.045
And that's whenever he dropped the first bomb, and the Japanese generals didn't want to stop.

13:43.733 --> 13:47.978
But Harry Truman, thank his soul, he dropped the second one.

13:47.998 --> 13:48.218
Right.

13:48.358 --> 13:51.823
And that's when everything stopped.

13:51.843 --> 13:55.667
And then we said, wait, we can wait to see what happened.

13:56.508 --> 14:00.673
So you were essentially, you were in the Leyte Gulf at this time, at Leyte, right?

14:00.693 --> 14:01.274
Yes, sir.

14:01.294 --> 14:02.355
On the flat bottom boat.

14:02.375 --> 14:02.796
That's right.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.297
Ready to sail, ready to go.

14:05.058 --> 14:10.625
When you heard about the first bomb on Hiroshima and the second bomb on Nagasaki.

14:10.785 --> 14:11.126
Yes, sir.

14:11.586 --> 14:12.407
And that happened.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.402
That changed everything around.

14:15.422 --> 14:19.166
That changed everything for you and your career and everything.

14:19.186 --> 14:21.388
The war was over at that time.

14:21.408 --> 14:28.154
I want to go to some photographs that you've supplied for us, and I want you to look at them and talk about them and tell us sort of what we're looking at.

14:28.174 --> 14:30.576
These are pictures from your career.

14:30.776 --> 14:31.197
I look here.

14:31.337 --> 14:31.857
Yes, sir.

14:31.877 --> 14:33.659
You can look right there at the monitor.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.985
That is Freddie Wolters at Denton High School.

14:40.045 --> 14:40.565
Is that right?

14:40.845 --> 14:41.466
That's right.

14:41.632 --> 14:45.619
And that is from the yearbook as Most Popular Boy.

14:45.839 --> 14:47.782
That's high school, Most Popular Boy.

14:47.802 --> 14:50.307
How come you were the most popular?

14:50.327 --> 14:51.609
Well, because I was.

14:53.131 --> 14:57.158
In other words, I was always doing what you were doing, laughing and talking and friendly to everybody.

14:57.899 --> 14:59.121
I knew that would be the answer.

14:59.702 --> 15:01.045
Well, and a good looking.

15:01.065 --> 15:03.589
Now, here you are at Texas A&M.

15:04.177 --> 15:05.939
What year was that taking?

15:06.159 --> 15:07.101
Was that your freshman year?

15:07.381 --> 15:09.083
That was senior in high school, 1939.

15:09.103 --> 15:13.008
Okay, but you're at A&M because you're at Texas A&M.

15:13.228 --> 15:15.651
At A&M, I was a freshman, you know.

15:15.892 --> 15:16.292
Right, right.

15:16.312 --> 15:18.395
The previous picture was at Denton High School.

15:18.415 --> 15:18.975
Yeah, that's right.

15:18.995 --> 15:20.177
This is at Texas A&M.

15:20.197 --> 15:21.278
Yeah.

15:21.298 --> 15:24.062
At Texas A&M, in those days, we didn't have boots.

15:25.123 --> 15:29.188
They cut them out, and you see that picture there, I got a saber, but there's no...

15:29.557 --> 15:30.418
No boots.

15:30.438 --> 15:30.659
Right.

15:30.699 --> 15:33.203
Because the war stopped making boots.

15:33.463 --> 15:33.803
I see.

15:34.304 --> 15:34.585
I see.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.067
So that's your senior picture.

15:36.347 --> 15:37.529
Is that your senior picture there?

15:37.569 --> 15:39.232
That's the senior picture right there.

15:39.252 --> 15:39.532
Right.

15:40.233 --> 15:40.514
Okay.

15:41.455 --> 15:45.301
Still got that hat sort of crooked, just being sort of cocky.

15:45.641 --> 15:45.922
Indeed.

15:46.523 --> 15:46.823
Indeed.

15:47.624 --> 15:47.885
All right.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.569
Let's move on to the next one.

15:50.589 --> 15:51.630
Tell me about this picture.

15:52.592 --> 15:57.219
Well, you see, we're laughing real good.

15:57.239 --> 15:57.960
You're on the right.

15:58.328 --> 16:13.028
And I'm on the right, and the man holding in his hand a bottle of beer, and he was at Army camp, and he didn't have any slightest idea that there was any beer anywhere around.

16:13.389 --> 16:19.397
And I always managed to have an old Army can and do everything normal, and I handed him.

16:19.457 --> 16:21.000
I said, how would you like to have this?

16:21.060 --> 16:23.643
And he said, oh, boy, that would be terrible.

16:23.663 --> 16:27.829
And that's when you see him there smiling and happy about it.

16:28.096 --> 16:32.841
But that's about all I can tell you.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.306
It sounds like somebody just said something funny.

16:37.346 --> 16:37.486
Yeah.

16:38.007 --> 16:45.535
This is later on, and we're going to talk about this later, your involvement with the Lions Club, because you have great involvement with the Lions Club.

16:45.835 --> 16:52.602
But I wanted to show people this picture to show your affection with the Lions Club, and we'll talk about that a little bit later.

16:53.358 --> 16:55.060
Just wanted to show that, and we'll move on.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.785
And here's you and your wife, Mickey, and you all have been married 64 years.

17:00.406 --> 17:01.448
That's what she told me.

17:01.468 --> 17:02.409
That's what she told me.

17:02.449 --> 17:03.310
That's what she told you.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.071
Remember, I asked her.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.634
She's a good-looking woman.

17:07.074 --> 17:07.655
She certainly is.

17:07.675 --> 17:08.416
And a wonderful wife.

17:09.077 --> 17:09.397
Indeed.

17:09.437 --> 17:10.659
Couldn't ask for anything better.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.181
Indeed.

17:12.201 --> 17:14.824
There's one more picture that we talked about.

17:15.104 --> 17:19.790
I want to introduce this first and then let you talk about it.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.512
1945, April the 21st.

17:22.673 --> 17:23.314
You're an Aggie.

17:24.138 --> 17:33.111
You were in a photograph that's really a very famous photograph that a lot of people have seen taken at Corregidor at Aggie Muster.

17:33.231 --> 17:35.154
We're going to show this picture on the screen.

17:35.194 --> 17:41.543
And while we're showing the picture, I'd like for you to talk about sort of how this all came to be.

17:41.563 --> 17:41.944
Go ahead.

17:42.903 --> 17:50.959
Well, actually, the thing on that deal right there, we all had a day's vacation, you might say.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.845
We used Army, Navy, Air Force, whatever.

17:54.447 --> 18:02.042
And we all were allowed to go to Corregidor for one day, and we all celebrated it.

18:02.393 --> 18:05.477
as you can see there in the picture.

18:06.318 --> 18:12.587
But then the celebration was over that day, and we went back to our units, and it was all forgotten.

18:12.607 --> 18:17.713
But in that deal right there, it was shown all over the campus.

18:18.034 --> 18:23.681
In other words, it was a little bitty April 21st deal.

18:23.802 --> 18:26.085
Well, that was mustered ahead of time.

18:26.365 --> 18:26.706
I see.

18:27.086 --> 18:27.967
I see.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.329
And all the...

18:30.203 --> 18:38.933
There's a close-up of the picture that we've blown up, and that's you right there without the hat.

18:39.874 --> 18:40.735
I looked at it a while ago.

18:41.576 --> 18:43.118
You see where the arrow comes down?

18:43.278 --> 18:43.538
Right.

18:43.678 --> 18:46.041
Well, I'm one with the arrow on that head.

18:46.061 --> 18:47.223
I'm not that other little one.

18:47.643 --> 18:47.923
Right.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.505
You're the one without the hat, right?

18:49.525 --> 18:49.906
There you are.

18:49.926 --> 18:51.427
Right, right, right.

18:51.447 --> 18:54.211
And I took off my hat so I'd be different than everybody else.

18:55.732 --> 18:57.274
So you could be able to tell people,

18:57.608 --> 18:59.072
I'm the one without the hat, right?

18:59.092 --> 18:59.874
Without the cap.

18:59.894 --> 19:00.295
Right.

19:00.315 --> 19:04.586
Now, the people who gathered for this picture, the military personnel, these were all branches.

19:04.607 --> 19:08.417
This was Army, Navy, Army Air Corps.

19:08.437 --> 19:10.783
Of course, they all pretty well dressed alike in those days.

19:10.803 --> 19:12.307
You didn't have too much difference.

19:12.327 --> 19:12.748
Right.

19:12.728 --> 19:13.289
Right.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.573
And what was the scene like?

19:15.633 --> 19:18.498
I mean, all of you Aggies getting together for that one day.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.622
I mean, this is just a snapshot.

19:20.642 --> 19:25.811
Well, I'd have to admit to you it was a pretty happy day for all of us.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.072
Right.

19:26.172 --> 19:29.758
Because we knew lots of people in there that we hadn't seen.

19:29.738 --> 19:31.260
And I don't know how long.

19:31.280 --> 19:37.046
And down on the front row is one of the boys who was a classmate of mine that went overseas with me all during the war.

19:37.507 --> 19:40.090
And he's on the front bottom row.

19:40.110 --> 19:43.674
And you're just really a camaraderie type deal.

19:43.894 --> 19:44.174
Right.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.857
So you talked about days at Aggieland.

19:46.877 --> 19:49.280
You talked about Texas A&M a lot that day.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.502
You had to do a lot of catching up in one day.

19:51.522 --> 19:54.966
I mean, we didn't have any problem talking.

19:54.986 --> 19:55.266
Right.

19:55.507 --> 19:56.708
I'll bet you didn't.

19:57.059 --> 19:58.460
How about how many were in that picture?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.623
It looks like... I can't answer that.

20:00.783 --> 20:01.864
A couple of hundred, maybe.

20:01.924 --> 20:02.264
I don't know.

20:02.985 --> 20:04.306
I'm not good at estimating something like that.

20:04.326 --> 20:04.807
Maybe more.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.228
I don't really know.

20:06.449 --> 20:07.670
Probably something like that.

20:07.730 --> 20:15.538
But I know a lot of people have seen this picture in books, and I think it's hanging on the walls at Texas A&M, and you've got that on the wall at your home.

20:15.558 --> 20:21.544
And I know that that only not means a lot to you, but muster, even today, means a lot to you.

20:21.784 --> 20:26.509
As the folks are seeing this show, muster has just happened a couple of weeks ago.

20:26.708 --> 20:31.097
So muster still means a lot to you, I would imagine.

20:31.117 --> 20:34.023
Well, it'd be pretty hard to say that it didn't.

20:37.830 --> 20:45.325
When this thing was taken here, for the muster, they always had

20:45.946 --> 20:49.511
Right up your head in there, the Aggie World War II heroes.

20:51.113 --> 20:52.736
Bill Yunkin interviewed us.

20:52.956 --> 20:53.396
Right.

20:53.416 --> 20:54.298
Had five of us.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.541
And he told them right off.

20:56.561 --> 21:03.831
He said, now, Freddie Wolters is going to be on the select one.

21:03.991 --> 21:11.001
He's going to go because he's going to be there whenever we have our April or 21st muster because this is all around that.

21:11.101 --> 21:13.184
And that's how that all came about.

21:13.264 --> 21:15.227
So sort of got in the limelight.

21:15.730 --> 21:16.271
Pretty quick.

21:16.871 --> 21:17.832
I know it means a lot to you.

21:18.373 --> 21:21.036
After the war, you returned to Texas A&M.

21:21.056 --> 21:25.581
You actually stayed in the service, in the reserve for some 30 years.

21:25.621 --> 21:26.422
That's right.

21:26.442 --> 21:27.423
Afterwards.

21:27.443 --> 21:36.172
But you were able to come back to Texas A&M and work for Jocko Roberts at the A&M plantation, the farm which was out on Highway 60.

21:36.513 --> 21:38.014
Talk about that work.

21:38.034 --> 21:45.282
Well, it'd be pretty hard for you to understand my background if I went to Denton High School

21:45.515 --> 22:00.093
without the eighth grade credit, and I had to come to A&M, and I had the same thing, but my goal was when the prof gave me the credits, he said, Freddie wants to go to A&M and be an ag teacher, and he was exactly right.

22:00.113 --> 22:08.223
That's all I knew, and the first time I ever came to A&M, we came here in high school, and I slept under the old stadium, all of us, and we came.

22:08.243 --> 22:15.252
I fell in love with A&M, but the idea about the...

22:17.071 --> 22:18.593
What were you asking me?

22:18.754 --> 22:22.038
About working at the A&M farm.

22:22.219 --> 22:22.619
Okay.

22:22.679 --> 22:22.880
Right.

22:23.661 --> 22:26.846
I never dreamed, never dreamed I'd ever be coming back here.

22:27.026 --> 22:27.266
Right.

22:27.587 --> 22:34.277
Because I went to Fannin County right after the war and taught veterans, veterans and vocational.

22:34.297 --> 22:34.517
Right.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.219
And I ended up being at Tyler.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.822
Nick and I recall that.

22:37.882 --> 22:39.985
We ended up, got promoted around.

22:40.065 --> 22:41.307
I was over nine counties.

22:41.506 --> 22:48.981
So I get a call from Jocko Roberts when I come and interview with him for a job at Canaan.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.045
And I said, yeah, I'll come.

22:51.105 --> 22:57.798
And so when I came, he talked about what you're doing and what I was going to do.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.802
He was assigned.

23:00.355 --> 23:02.758
do all this development across railroad track.

23:02.778 --> 23:04.981
They were dusted across railroad track.

23:05.001 --> 23:07.824
And that's what Gibb Gilker signed him to coordinate that.

23:07.864 --> 23:11.008
And he said, I can't do it because I've got to have, he said, well, get your helper.

23:11.509 --> 23:12.550
Well, what did he look for?

23:12.610 --> 23:18.037
He looked for someone that would work because he wasn't looking for somebody smart because he wouldn't have selected me.

23:18.137 --> 23:19.880
So he asked me to come here.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.422
Right.

23:21.442 --> 23:25.086
We have a few minutes left and we talked about your involvement with the Lions Club.

23:25.106 --> 23:26.628
And I know that this means a lot to you.

23:26.688 --> 23:29.772
Talk about your involvement and you have been honored many times

23:30.038 --> 23:31.119
by the Lions Club.

23:31.139 --> 23:31.640
I know that.

23:32.120 --> 23:32.781
Well, yes, sir.

23:32.941 --> 23:37.386
I was involved in the Lions Club from grassroot up.

23:37.606 --> 23:47.076
And when I was in high school, in order to play football, Mr. Carrington had a drugstore.

23:47.176 --> 23:55.985
He and his wife and babe, they signed a car to me that would be there night and day to haul me back home.

23:56.025 --> 23:57.106
I never had to ask for it.

23:57.567 --> 23:58.948
Well, we was over at Austin.

23:59.317 --> 24:16.935
at our deal, and I was state membership chairman, and my senior, when he got, and he was there, and he got up and talked, and then when he got through talking, then I said, I want to go back and talk, and I was membership chairman.

24:17.236 --> 24:24.143
We had our convention, and I had a tremendous year, and so I said, now this is the man that

24:24.798 --> 24:27.340
It got me through A&M.

24:27.741 --> 24:30.763
I said, can you imagine anybody furnishing a car for you?

24:31.684 --> 24:36.068
For all the time you're there and never know you, you just furnish it.

24:36.689 --> 24:39.211
And tears just rolled out of his eyes.

24:39.832 --> 24:43.875
In fact, this last week I got a letter from his son.

24:46.157 --> 24:47.979
That's a wonderful story.

24:47.999 --> 24:49.581
We have just a couple of minutes left.

24:49.641 --> 24:53.404
I know that in your later life you spent some 30 years

24:53.772 --> 24:57.175
in the banking business here in town as a lender.

24:57.676 --> 25:01.499
But I want to take the last couple of minutes to let you talk about your family.

25:01.520 --> 25:08.066
You and your wife, Mickey, have been married for 64 years, and I know you have four kids and 12 grandkids and 11 great grandkids.

25:08.506 --> 25:09.988
We don't have time to name them all.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.771
I don't know whether you could, but I know that you're very proud of your family.

25:13.791 --> 25:19.897
Well, I couldn't tell you for certain I couldn't be any prouder, and none of them live close by.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.619
They're all away.

25:22.156 --> 25:25.782
And they all have made a great life for themselves.

25:25.822 --> 25:28.907
But I thank goodness that they're not close by.

25:28.927 --> 25:33.213
Because when you get our age, they drop in on you, drop in on you, that sort of thing.

25:33.233 --> 25:34.976
So we're glad they're scattered around.

25:36.358 --> 25:40.064
So you can sort of pick and choose the times that you can see them all.

25:40.384 --> 25:40.825
Yeah, yeah.

25:40.845 --> 25:45.873
Becky got a call from our daughter that lives in Missouri.

25:45.953 --> 25:47.556
And we've got a little grandson.

25:48.377 --> 25:49.138
He's our favorite.

25:49.719 --> 25:50.340
And...

25:50.675 --> 25:51.577
He wanted to talk.

25:52.019 --> 25:56.591
Of course, he wanted to talk to Pawpaw too, but Pawpaw couldn't hear on it, so I couldn't talk to him.

25:57.092 --> 26:00.501
But that's a real quick story with him.

26:01.564 --> 26:02.647
Thank you for being our guest.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.013
We're out of time, and thank you for your service.

26:05.033 --> 26:05.815
I appreciate it.

26:06.638 --> 26:14.048
Freddie Wolters says that when he leaves this life, the first person he'll look up is his mother, second one, Harry Truman.

26:14.789 --> 26:17.773
There will certainly be some great stories to swap.

26:17.793 --> 26:28.327
Freddie and Mickey Wolters have been married for 64 years, and with their four children, 12 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren, we salute him for his service then and his service now.

26:28.347 --> 26:29.588
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:29.608 --> 26:32.292
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
