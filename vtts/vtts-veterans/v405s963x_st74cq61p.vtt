Music Music

00:17.108 --> 00:38.123
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.143 --> 00:39.285
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:39.603 --> 00:49.661
Noble Goza is a World War II veteran for sure, although by the time he was drafted in 1945, little did he know that the war was about to end.

00:49.681 --> 00:57.696
His 4th Marines Division had been sent to Maui as replacement troops for the 4th Marines survivors returning from Iwo Jima.

00:57.980 --> 01:03.908
While training for what everyone figured would be a ground war with Japan, well, the bomb was dropped.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.611
And soon after, the war was over.

01:06.192 --> 01:11.519
He spent another year in Hawaii, soon was discharged, thinking that he would never ever see combat.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.562
Well, he was wrong.

01:13.582 --> 01:21.473
Fast forward to 1950, when then Marine Reserve Noble Goza was redeployed, this time the fast track to Korea.

01:21.824 --> 01:35.686
He was on an LST to the cliffs of Incheon, then later to North Korea, where his 7th Marines Division was on its way to the Chosin Reservoir when he was wounded and his military service came to a quicker than expected end.

01:36.147 --> 01:42.297
His is a fascinating story of service in two wars, and we welcome Noble Goza to Veterans of the Valley.

01:42.935 --> 01:44.297
Noble, it's a pleasure to have you.

01:44.317 --> 01:46.020
It's a pleasure to know you and to meet you.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.785
You and I got to go on the Lone Star Honor Flight to Washington, D.C.

01:49.866 --> 01:51.889
back in May, and that was a thrill.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.491
We'll talk about that a little bit later on.

01:53.551 --> 01:54.453
We'll have some pictures.

01:54.533 --> 02:00.782
But talk about, you were in high school, I guess, in Houston when you were drafted in 1945.

02:00.842 --> 02:01.984
That's right.

02:02.004 --> 02:08.554
I only liked about six months of graduating, but Uncle Sam had other ideas, so...

02:08.922 --> 02:18.030
Away I went and went through boot camp in Parris Island and training in Camp Lejeune.

02:18.231 --> 02:19.472
North Carolina.

02:19.492 --> 02:22.595
A railroad trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

02:24.016 --> 02:35.407
I wound up in Camp Pendleton and from there on over to the 4th Marine Division, which had just returned from Iwo Jima.

02:35.427 --> 02:36.387
I was a replacement.

02:36.668 --> 02:36.988
Right.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.747
And you were just a raw recruit.

02:39.767 --> 02:40.929
You were a jarhead.

02:40.949 --> 02:41.770
That's right.

02:41.790 --> 02:46.798
You were just a young Marine sort of from Houston, Texas.

02:46.858 --> 03:00.158
And all of a sudden you were thinking at the time when you went to Maui, you were training for really what everybody believed was going to be an unwanted and what would have certainly been a bloody ground war in Japan.

03:00.796 --> 03:05.384
Do you remember that time in thinking about where you might be headed and what you might be headed into?

03:05.404 --> 03:13.157
Well, they said that we were going to be going to one of the larger islands in the Japanese group.

03:13.457 --> 03:13.998
Right.

03:14.018 --> 03:16.302
Which one we really never did know.

03:17.384 --> 03:18.265
But that's all right.

03:18.305 --> 03:19.107
We never went.

03:19.427 --> 03:20.489
Right.

03:20.509 --> 03:21.911
Small armed ordinance.

03:22.232 --> 03:22.532
Yes.

03:22.893 --> 03:25.858
But after the war was over, I...

03:26.142 --> 03:39.375
Didn't have enough time to come home, so I was redeployed to a Marine Small Arms Arlington's Depot, two and a half miles from downtown Honolulu.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.892
Well, I guess if you got to serve, that's not a bad place to be.

03:41.912 --> 03:42.773
That's not a bad place.

03:44.514 --> 03:46.656
You eventually did come home.

03:46.676 --> 03:47.617
I did come home.

03:48.017 --> 03:50.600
And you were honorably discharged from the Marines.

03:50.620 --> 03:54.243
And I guess at the time you thought, well, your military service was over.

03:54.263 --> 03:57.566
So you came back to Houston and you went to work for a while, right?

03:57.606 --> 03:58.106
That's right.

03:58.126 --> 03:58.727
I went to work.

03:59.808 --> 04:07.554
And at the time that I left, I had just started training as a bus driver for the Houston Transit.

04:07.835 --> 04:08.215
Right.

04:08.397 --> 04:23.697
Of course, that interrupted about the middle of my training, so when I came back, I started that all back over again, and for a couple of three years after, that was my employment at Houston Transit County.

04:23.717 --> 04:26.481
After you got back from Korea, but let's go back.

04:26.621 --> 04:27.643
No, World War II.

04:27.663 --> 04:29.705
Yeah, from World War II, right.

04:29.765 --> 04:33.190
But you were called up again in 1950 when Korea and

04:33.338 --> 04:35.340
That was pretty much of a fast track, wasn't it?

04:35.380 --> 04:38.944
Because you had already had training in Hawaii.

04:39.444 --> 04:46.811
So when you went to Pendleton in California, you were pretty much just waiting there to get on an LST and go to Korea.

04:46.831 --> 04:48.173
Well, we didn't wait long.

04:48.193 --> 04:48.553
Didn't wait long.

04:48.573 --> 04:52.237
Because they was forming a 7th Marine Regiment.

04:53.198 --> 04:56.301
And I was absorbed into that regiment.

04:57.382 --> 05:02.367
And we was on high seas in less than a week.

05:02.735 --> 05:11.407
You said within 23 days you were... Well, from 23 days from the time I left Houston, we was under machine gun fire in Korea.

05:11.427 --> 05:12.809
In Korea.

05:12.829 --> 05:19.699
Talk about that experience of landing in Korea, the cliffs of Incheon.

05:20.420 --> 05:24.066
It's a very notable and famous part of the Korean conflict.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.769
Well, it's a very unusual place to make a landing.

05:26.789 --> 05:27.070
Right.

05:27.791 --> 05:32.117
The tide goes out and you have about two or three miles of mud flat.

05:32.215 --> 05:39.137
So it has to be timed at the exact time to get up to the wall.

05:39.370 --> 05:44.095
But MacArthur had it all figured out to a fine detail.

05:44.115 --> 06:02.513
And he supervised the timing and everything, and we made the landing at Incheon, went on up through Kempo Airfield, and then through Sewell, and on up towards the 38th parallel.

06:02.953 --> 06:07.858
I want to go back to climbing the wall, because I've heard so many stories about that.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.565
And I realize it's been a long time.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.648
It's been 60 years.

06:13.849 --> 06:16.814
But what do you remember about that?

06:16.834 --> 06:20.780
Had you had training where you were climbing like rope ladders, I guess?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.102
Well, it was rope ladders.

06:22.163 --> 06:26.330
We had some stationary ladders, but mostly rope ladders.

06:26.450 --> 06:31.939
And we were well accustomed to that because that's where we went over the sides of these ships.

06:32.071 --> 06:32.472
Right.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.115
Into the landing craft.

06:34.135 --> 06:34.475
Right.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.920
So that really wasn't anything new.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.923
We were just going up instead of down.

06:40.105 --> 06:44.192
And you were going up without realizing what you were going to find when you got to the top.

06:44.413 --> 06:45.174
That's right.

06:45.194 --> 06:46.857
What type of resistance you might have.

06:47.191 --> 07:15.612
our regiment went ashore there was relatively small opposition and we wasn't really in the first wave they didn't really encounter all that much uh opposition right but and we was more fortunate we encountered less so you went into the to the country a certain distance and then you turned things over to the army and then you came back out and you got back on

07:16.081 --> 07:16.922
What type of vessel?

07:17.303 --> 07:17.943
LST.

07:18.044 --> 07:19.425
Back on an LST.

07:19.445 --> 07:24.452
Went around the south tip of Korea, I guess, and upwards to North Korea.

07:24.472 --> 07:36.127
And we waited off shores because the North Koreans had mined the offshore waters there where they thought we might make a landing.

07:36.147 --> 07:40.873
And it took them several days to clear the mines so that we could

07:41.275 --> 07:43.279
go on in, you know, to shore.

07:43.540 --> 07:44.000
Right.

07:44.021 --> 07:46.265
Now, how did you go into shore when you came back on North Korea?

07:46.285 --> 07:48.730
Was that just a regular shore landing?

07:48.890 --> 07:49.171
Yes.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.135
That was just a shore landing.

07:51.155 --> 07:54.321
Well, we really didn't know what we were going to run into.

07:54.622 --> 07:54.862
Right.

07:56.806 --> 08:03.199
We were ready for anything, but it turned out there was relatively small opposition there.

08:03.449 --> 08:15.504
You were a foot soldier headed to the Chosin Reservoir, Able Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division, and you were in the 2nd platoon.

08:16.345 --> 08:20.110
We're going to see some photographs here in a moment.

08:20.150 --> 08:27.960
As a matter of fact, let's go to the photographs right now because before we go on, I want to see some of the photographs here.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.562
Here's the first one.

08:29.582 --> 08:31.484
About how old were you in this picture, do you think?

08:31.604 --> 08:33.186
I think I was 19.

08:33.706 --> 08:36.870
You look about 19, like you don't know what you're about to get into.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.152
There you go.

08:38.272 --> 08:39.994
But a good-looking Marine.

08:40.014 --> 08:41.977
Now, this was in Hawaii, right?

08:41.997 --> 08:46.963
Yes, this was at Camp Catlin, the Ordnance Depot.

08:47.163 --> 09:00.220
As the units would break up around the Pacific, they would send their small arms back to our depot, and we would check them, refurnish them.

09:00.757 --> 09:06.556
put them in Cosmo Lane and then go off to different places after that.

09:07.579 --> 09:09.726
And this particular day you had forklift duty.

09:10.047 --> 09:10.489
That's right.

09:10.589 --> 09:12.977
Obviously.

09:14.594 --> 09:18.441
This was during part of your training in August of 1945.

09:18.461 --> 09:20.425
This was with the 4th Marine Division on Maui.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.208
On Maui, right.

09:22.890 --> 09:29.121
I was with the division about eight months before they broke up and all came home.

09:29.943 --> 09:33.229
And I went to Honolulu and they went home.

09:33.430 --> 09:34.712
What do you think you were shooting at there?

09:35.401 --> 09:38.585
Well, it was probably no live ammunition.

09:38.605 --> 09:43.890
It was just maybe a photo op, you know.

09:43.910 --> 09:46.533
Yeah, let's find a good-looking Marine and take a picture of him.

09:46.553 --> 09:50.017
Okay, this is the most remarkable photograph that you have.

09:51.078 --> 09:55.403
And if you can't read at the bottom, I'm going to read that.

09:55.763 --> 10:01.530
Marines move north towards the Yala.

10:01.890 --> 10:02.231
Yala.

10:02.351 --> 10:02.691
Yala.

10:03.194 --> 10:05.356
and into the Chosin Reservoir area.

10:06.077 --> 10:10.560
First contact and action against the Chinese army took place at Sudang.

10:11.701 --> 10:13.963
And then there's more on that.

10:14.003 --> 10:15.325
This is the second platoon.

10:15.825 --> 10:20.669
And as you can see, that is, you're identified there in this photograph.

10:21.430 --> 10:24.793
And Lieutenant Bradley is to the right.

10:24.813 --> 10:27.675
You say you remember this photograph being taken.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.257
You can remember this.

10:29.717 --> 10:32.880
Talk about where you are, what you're doing there, and sort of this photograph.

10:32.995 --> 10:41.123
Well, we had just broke camp that morning, and I think this was about 7.30 in the morning.

10:41.143 --> 10:47.389
And, of course, the whole company was moving out, and that's me.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.751
You can see my goza nose there.

10:50.952 --> 10:58.800
And Lieutenant Bradley, he was going to put his sea bag in the Jeep,

10:59.624 --> 11:02.147
Of course, he rode most of the way and we walked.

11:03.108 --> 11:11.979
And there were two cameras there, one a steel camera and the other a fellow with an eight millimeter.

11:12.379 --> 11:18.907
And I remember exactly that particular time.

11:19.167 --> 11:22.171
You said you remember the photographer saying, watch the birdie.

11:22.191 --> 11:22.471
Yes.

11:22.712 --> 11:25.635
And then you said something back to him that we can't repeat right now.

11:25.655 --> 11:26.256
That's right.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.078
But you know, you can sort of tell.

11:28.447 --> 11:33.218
Although the picture is a little bit fuzzy, you can sort of tell that you were watching the birdie.

11:33.238 --> 11:35.423
It looked like you were kind of smiling at the photographer there.

11:36.646 --> 11:46.388
And little did I know that three days after that picture was taken, I would be wounded in action on a hill 352.

11:47.363 --> 11:52.890
Now, if I'm right, if I told you right, you really just came across this picture about eight years ago, right?

11:52.930 --> 11:57.034
When you happened to see Lieutenant Bradley or he called you.

11:57.054 --> 11:57.595
He called me.

11:57.815 --> 12:02.421
He's passed away now, but about eight years ago, he called you and said, hey, I've got a picture that you're in.

12:02.481 --> 12:02.721
Yeah.

12:02.981 --> 12:08.528
Well, the chosen few, the fraternal organization that we belong to,

12:08.879 --> 12:36.743
has a website, thechosenfew.com, and from time to time they put new pictures on that website, and I think it was about 9 o'clock one night, the phone rang and it was, I called him Lieutenant Bradley, he stayed in, he retired a major, but Lieutenant Bradley called me and said, go get your,

12:37.381 --> 12:40.978
computer up and going and said, I'll see your picture.

12:41.768 --> 12:47.456
And so that's when I realized that my picture was on the web.

12:47.817 --> 12:49.539
This was November of 1950.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.662
Y'all are pretty bundled up there.

12:51.723 --> 12:53.125
Was it terribly cold?

12:53.145 --> 12:54.346
Well, no.

12:54.366 --> 12:57.671
It hadn't really got into the sub-zero weather then.

12:57.751 --> 12:58.853
Right, right.

12:59.133 --> 12:59.754
Still pretty cold.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.377
Cold enough to where you all are.

13:01.677 --> 13:02.679
Y'all are bundled up there.

13:03.019 --> 13:05.383
And so that's the second platoon, and you're on your way.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.510
This is literally a picture of you becoming a member of the Chosen Few.

13:11.047 --> 13:13.870
right there, because you're on your way to the Chosen Valley.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.673
A remarkable, remarkable photograph, it really is.

13:17.693 --> 13:18.254
Let's move on.

13:21.697 --> 13:24.179
Next picture, I think, is coming up.

13:24.199 --> 13:24.560
There we go.

13:24.980 --> 13:28.864
Now this, tell us about this picture, because this is your dad.

13:29.064 --> 13:34.529
Well, this has nothing to do with the 1950 Marine Corps.

13:34.589 --> 13:36.611
No, no, this is 1920.

13:36.671 --> 13:37.332
This is 1922.

13:37.872 --> 13:38.633
Such a great picture.

13:38.653 --> 13:40.775
My father was a barber.

13:40.795 --> 13:40.935
Uh-huh.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.984
And that's him first chair on the right.

13:44.004 --> 13:49.353
This in the first chair on the right is my father standing behind a man.

13:49.473 --> 13:52.138
I assume he just gave a haircut to you.

13:52.298 --> 14:00.812
And his shop was in the lobby of the Taylor Hotel in Taylor, Texas.

14:00.832 --> 14:03.396
And I haven't been there in years, but

14:03.747 --> 14:06.631
I understand that the old hotel is still standing.

14:06.691 --> 14:08.053
I'll have to check in then.

14:08.834 --> 14:19.469
But that was true to its area, the wood stove and everything, you know.

14:19.489 --> 14:21.552
Well, like I said, this has nothing to do with your service.

14:22.093 --> 14:23.635
It has nothing to do with you.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.097
You weren't even born yet.

14:25.117 --> 14:29.383
But I just thought it was such a great, clear picture.

14:29.853 --> 14:32.258
from the 1920s of your dad, the barber.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.905
You must have been very proud of him.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.287
Okay, let's move on.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.752
Now, obviously, we fast forward quite a bit.

14:40.253 --> 14:46.966
One of the, at the time, Lieutenant Colonel Raymond G. Davis became General Davis.

14:47.026 --> 14:51.034
He was a member of your platoon.

14:51.487 --> 14:54.659
And later on in San Antonio, you had a reunion with him.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.808
Talk about Raymond Davis.

14:57.691 --> 14:59.438
He's a Medal of Honor.

14:59.538 --> 15:01.345
General Davis was...

15:01.645 --> 15:30.994
regimental commander of the 7th Marine in Korea a smaller man in stature but he could do anything and he wound up getting the Medal of Honor and he saved about half of our company from complete annihilation and of course the chosen few we had our

15:31.261 --> 15:49.765
reunions and this was taken at one of the reunions in San Antonio and that's me and my daughter Crystal and General Davis.

15:50.626 --> 15:52.709
Great reunion and a great picture.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.231
We're going to talk about another

15:54.650 --> 15:57.415
fellow Marine also in a moment.

15:57.435 --> 16:01.182
But let's go back now to Korea, the photograph that we saw.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.565
Oh, wait, I'm sorry, we've got more pictures.

16:03.166 --> 16:03.827
I apologize.

16:03.887 --> 16:12.023
We talked about that you were on the Lone Star Honor Flight with us back on May the 1st, or back in May.

16:12.043 --> 16:16.371
And this is a picture of you on board the airplane with your guardian.

16:16.688 --> 16:18.290
And we had a great time.

16:18.350 --> 16:23.598
We did a couple of shows on the Lone Star Honor Flight, and that's where I got a chance to meet you was on the Honor Flight.

16:23.678 --> 16:27.043
And there you are on the plane.

16:27.063 --> 16:28.465
We're headed to Washington, D.C.

16:29.586 --> 16:36.236
And the next picture, I believe, yeah, there you are in front of the World War II Memorial.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.878
Boy, it was hot that day, wasn't it?

16:37.898 --> 16:38.699
It was, yeah.

16:38.719 --> 16:42.605
I mean, that was early May, and it was in the mid-'90s, I believe, that day.

16:42.625 --> 16:43.506
It was a hot day.

16:44.431 --> 16:46.133
at the World War II Memorial.

16:46.153 --> 16:59.111
And then, of course, there you are, former Marine, in front of, I guess a lot of people call that the Iwo Jima Memorial, where its proper name is the United States Marines War Memorial.

17:00.252 --> 17:07.322
And, of course, the flag raising depicted at the top of Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima.

17:07.642 --> 17:09.104
But anyway, some great pictures there.

17:09.485 --> 17:12.649
Now, I want to go back to that photograph that we saw.

17:13.135 --> 17:16.279
of the platoon marching towards the Chosen Reservoir.

17:17.020 --> 17:22.307
And talk about what happened three days after that photograph was taken on November the 4th.

17:22.347 --> 17:30.458
Well, at that particular day, I think it must have been around 9 or 10 o'clock.

17:31.799 --> 17:37.186
We had orders to secure Hill 352.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.468
Right.

17:38.482 --> 17:51.093
It kind of commanded the supplier out there and they wanted to be sure that everything, there was no enemy at all on that.

17:51.113 --> 17:54.381
But then all of a sudden we started getting fire.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.821
Terrific fire.

17:58.523 --> 18:03.348
And we got pinned down for a while.

18:03.789 --> 18:16.343
One of our BAR men got into position and I think there was three machine gun nests, enemy machine gun nests, ahead of us.

18:16.363 --> 18:21.128
And he wiped out one, but there was two left.

18:22.778 --> 18:24.981
that we was in grave danger.

18:25.001 --> 18:26.483
Yes, sir.

18:26.503 --> 18:28.046
They really had us pinned down.

18:28.807 --> 18:34.194
And so 1st Platoon Sergeant Poynter.

18:34.755 --> 18:35.496
James Poynter.

18:35.516 --> 18:36.317
James Poynter.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.284
He saw the seriousness of the situation.

18:42.646 --> 18:46.592
He grabbed an automatic weapon and charged him.

18:47.770 --> 18:52.578
with complete disregard to his safety.

18:53.740 --> 18:58.848
He picked up several grenades from wounded Marines as he went.

19:00.811 --> 19:10.707
He obliterated the two machine gun nests, but he was wounded, mortally wounded in that attack.

19:10.727 --> 19:12.951
And for that he received the Medal of Honor.

19:13.272 --> 19:13.592
Right.

19:13.977 --> 19:21.990
And I had the honor myself of help carrying his body back to the aid station.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.553
Indeed, remarkable story.

19:23.813 --> 19:31.446
And I want to mention that there is a website and it is

19:32.405 --> 19:38.551
www.chosenfew.com.

19:39.171 --> 19:42.894
It gives the complete history of The Chosen Few.

19:44.055 --> 19:49.480
There's a digest that comes out a few times a year called The Chosen Few.

19:50.081 --> 19:55.626
The article you gave me describes the battle that you just described so well.

19:56.447 --> 20:02.412
But then after that firefight, later on that evening, coming back down,

20:02.763 --> 20:03.925
is when you were wounded.

20:04.326 --> 20:05.589
Talk about how you were wounded.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.234
Well, we secured the hill.

20:09.337 --> 20:15.029
We came down to the road in a very deep valley.

20:16.311 --> 20:23.286
The bottom of the valley was a river, a road, and then steep sides on either side.

20:23.637 --> 20:30.024
Well, we had moved on up and it was dusky dark.

20:30.284 --> 20:30.585
Right.

20:31.986 --> 20:42.197
And we came to a place and about, I think about 200 yards ahead was a sharp right hand curve.

20:42.397 --> 20:44.760
We couldn't see around it.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.843
Lieutenant Bradley said, I want two volunteers.

20:48.704 --> 20:50.707
Goza, you and somebody else.

20:51.187 --> 20:52.969
We immediately was volunteering.

20:53.489 --> 21:03.643
So we went on up and immediately when we rounded the curve, we came under automatic weapon fire.

21:05.566 --> 21:13.917
I was hitting the leg along with another buddy of mine alongside of me.

21:13.977 --> 21:15.079
It was a ricochet.

21:16.461 --> 21:22.389
And we had humongous rocks all around us.

21:22.709 --> 21:23.310
Right.

21:23.290 --> 21:33.563
They drove me and another boy around to behind the rocks and by that time it was just whining off the far side.

21:34.364 --> 21:39.150
But it became dark and pretty soon here came a jeep and got us back.

21:40.551 --> 21:49.062
It took them four days to get the wounded back

21:49.835 --> 21:53.299
to where we had made the landing at Hung Nam.

21:53.319 --> 22:01.589
We went on board the hospital ship Hope, and that's where I operated on.

22:01.829 --> 22:06.455
They got the fragment out, and I went on back to Japan.

22:06.475 --> 22:13.864
Before that, you were just at a first aid station, where you said that the Red Cross pretty much was an aiming point for the Chinese, right?

22:13.884 --> 22:17.428
Well, yeah, we had what they call the Cracker Box ambulances,

22:17.965 --> 22:24.375
The Red Cross emblem was just an aiming point for North Koreans and the Chinese.

22:24.696 --> 22:27.100
Right, right.

22:28.843 --> 22:35.754
So, but your wounds were severe enough to where you could not continue in battle, and eventually you were sent back home.

22:35.774 --> 22:36.575
Yes.

22:36.595 --> 22:42.645
You were sent back home, and that was the end of your combat career, and you were eventually discharged for the second time.

22:43.066 --> 22:43.146
Yes.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.550
From the U.S.

22:44.610 --> 22:45.691
Marines.

22:45.711 --> 22:50.839
We've got a few minutes left, and I want you to talk about sort of your post-military career.

22:50.859 --> 22:52.041
Talk a little bit about that.

22:52.081 --> 22:54.544
You said that you did a little bit of everything.

22:54.564 --> 22:55.245
You were a machinist.

22:55.265 --> 22:59.011
That's right, but let's go back to when I was discharged the last time.

22:59.131 --> 23:00.272
Okay, go ahead.

23:00.292 --> 23:09.646
When I was in the hospital at Japan, a lieutenant come around and said, Goza, you got the Purple Heart, but we run out.

23:10.908 --> 23:12.610
That's right, and I was going to get to that.

23:12.893 --> 23:13.914
Go ahead.

23:14.035 --> 23:14.635
No, go ahead.

23:14.675 --> 23:15.416
You tell the story.

23:16.198 --> 23:18.781
So he said, go ahead.

23:18.821 --> 23:23.407
We're going to get you back to the States.

23:23.447 --> 23:27.533
And when you get discharged, well, I'm sure they'll have Purple Heart there.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.218
Back to Treasure Island, discharged.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.164
Sergeant said, go, we're out of Purple Heart.

23:35.844 --> 23:37.747
So many got them, we just run out.

23:38.108 --> 23:39.009
Still no Purple Heart.

23:39.029 --> 23:42.073
And he said, if you can wait four or five days,

23:42.728 --> 23:43.831
We'll have them.

23:43.851 --> 23:44.713
Right.

23:44.733 --> 23:50.346
I said in four or five days I can be eating mama's apple pie.

23:50.366 --> 23:54.154
So I went on home and that's the way it was left.

23:54.174 --> 23:55.056
With no purple heart.

23:55.077 --> 23:56.380
With no purple heart.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.402
However.

23:57.422 --> 23:58.324
However, yes.

23:58.388 --> 24:08.740
We fast forward quite a bit to just a few years ago, not that many years ago, I should say, and a ceremony at a local elementary school.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.902
No, A&M history class.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.344
A&M history class, that's right.

24:12.905 --> 24:19.172
Talk about that because it was covered by local television, and talk about what happened that day.

24:19.332 --> 24:27.442
Well, for some reason, unknown reason to me, somebody discovered that I never received a purple art.

24:27.462 --> 24:27.822
Right.

24:28.257 --> 24:41.676
And so Dr. Arnold Kramer, history professor at A&M, whenever his class gets to the point where he's on the Korean class,

24:42.382 --> 24:56.387
part, he turns the complete class over to the members of the chosen few to enlighten them on the real history of Korean conflict.

24:57.629 --> 25:02.938
So when that was over, he said, those will come up.

25:04.133 --> 25:10.909
And at that time, I discovered what a Marine Corps major was doing there.

25:10.949 --> 25:13.775
This was a complete surprise to you, right?

25:13.795 --> 25:14.958
A complete surprise.

25:15.138 --> 25:15.679
Right.

25:15.760 --> 25:22.575
So 43 years after the fact, I received a Purple Heart.

25:22.756 --> 25:23.357
You did.

25:23.337 --> 25:35.250
You did, you received your Purple Heart and it was a total surprise and I got to see your Purple Heart the other day and indeed it looks newer than most Purple Hearts that were awarded to World War II veterans.

25:35.310 --> 25:38.333
I will say that because it is newer.

25:39.074 --> 25:52.888
Personally, after you returned from World War II, before you went to Korea, I believe you were married at that time and have two children from that marriage, I believe, and your first wife died in 1978.

25:53.088 --> 26:00.597
And you were remarried, and a very wonderful thing happened to you when you were 61 years old.

26:00.617 --> 26:03.140
Well, I remarried after two years.

26:03.261 --> 26:04.783
I said, this is not for me.

26:05.924 --> 26:14.715
And I remarried a younger lady, much younger than I. And I think we'd been married about four years.

26:16.437 --> 26:17.739
And when I was 62.

26:18.780 --> 26:21.323
62.

26:21.995 --> 26:23.097
We had a little girl.

26:23.537 --> 26:25.120
How about that?

26:25.140 --> 26:27.063
And she's 24 years old now?

26:27.083 --> 26:29.327
She's 24 years old right now.

26:29.407 --> 26:32.973
She's an LVN nurse at the Prazos Valley Woman's Clinic.

26:33.193 --> 26:33.814
Went to Blinn?

26:34.155 --> 26:35.036
Went to Blinn.

26:35.497 --> 26:39.283
First she wanted to be a musician, and then she decided she wanted to be a nurse, right?

26:39.303 --> 26:42.728
And she went to Blinn, and she's working here right now, and she's 24 years old.

26:42.808 --> 26:45.673
So, yeah, you were...

26:46.143 --> 26:50.107
You were 80 years old, I guess, when she graduated from high school, I guess, just about, right?

26:52.629 --> 26:54.831
Well, congratulations on that.

26:54.851 --> 26:56.352
Talk a little bit about, though, your career.

26:56.392 --> 26:57.613
You're a machinist.

26:57.653 --> 26:59.255
You make stuff.

26:59.675 --> 27:06.041
And you had a long career with a lot of companies, but the UT Medical School was really your last job where you worked.

27:06.061 --> 27:06.962
Yes, that's right.

27:08.563 --> 27:13.888
When the financial bottom fell out of the oil industry,

27:13.987 --> 27:18.645
industry in the early 80s, there was no job for machining.

27:18.766 --> 27:19.087
Right.

27:19.549 --> 27:23.203
So I see this ad in the Chronicle, wanted

27:23.622 --> 27:28.789
Manager for Instrument Machine Shop, University of Texas Medical School.

27:28.929 --> 27:29.710
And that's where you went.

27:29.770 --> 27:32.113
I wish we could talk more about it, but we are out of time.

27:32.233 --> 27:36.699
But we've talked about your military career and a great one it was, and thank you for your service.

27:37.240 --> 27:37.841
Appreciate it.

27:38.201 --> 27:39.483
Thank you, Noble.

27:39.503 --> 27:39.703
All right.

27:39.723 --> 27:48.094
Brief service in World War II, a Purple Heart earned in Korea, a remarkable post-military career, and a new dad at age 61.

27:48.074 --> 27:53.402
And at only 85 years old, you get the idea that Noble Goza's life still has stories to tell.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.387
We salute him for his service as a United States Marine.

27:56.968 --> 27:57.929
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:57.949 --> 28:11.550
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
