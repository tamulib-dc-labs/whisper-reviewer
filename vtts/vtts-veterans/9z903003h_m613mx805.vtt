01:31.392 --> 01:55.652
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

01:55.672 --> 01:57.535
I'm Tom Turbyville.

01:57.751 --> 02:03.878
Colonel Lannis Hope did not land on Omaha Beach on D-Day, but he did watch it all from offshore that day.

02:04.499 --> 02:18.236
The next day, June the 7th, 1944, D plus one, his unit brought the first tanks to Normandy, an eyewitness to what Hollywood called the longest day, an eyewitness to the horror of death that the invasion left behind.

02:18.256 --> 02:22.922
A West Texas boy and a musician, a member of the Texas Tech band of the 1940s.

02:24.003 --> 02:26.526
Lannis and Peggy Hope are proud parents of three children.

02:27.063 --> 02:31.467
and proud longtime residents of Bryan and proud veteran of World War II.

02:31.587 --> 02:34.030
Colonel Hope, it's a pleasure to have you here today.

02:34.370 --> 02:41.677
I want to go to June the 6th and June the 7th of 1944, days that are certainly very strong in our history of our war.

02:42.197 --> 02:47.742
Talk about where you were, what your job was, and sort of how those days came about.

02:47.762 --> 02:54.569
A little bit of a surprise because you were supposed to go onshore, sundown on D-Day, but it didn't work out that way.

02:54.589 --> 02:55.990
Sort of take us through those two days.

02:56.678 --> 03:06.512
Well, there was a very detailed arrangement and schedule for the landing on D-Day, minute by minute.

03:07.914 --> 03:15.444
And our minutes were listed officially as D plus 13, which is a late afternoon.

03:16.606 --> 03:24.036
Well, of course, we knew by dark that we wouldn't go ashore, so we spent the night again, sleepless,

03:24.539 --> 03:26.662
because we spent the previous night sleepless.

03:27.844 --> 03:37.859
And we waited all day the 7th without the scheduled boats getting to us to take us ashore.

03:37.879 --> 03:46.311
And so finally, late in the afternoon, they, I think, commandeered an LCT

03:46.696 --> 03:58.294
to come to the LST, the bigger ship, and take my platoon, five tanks, off on that ship and take us to shore.

04:00.517 --> 04:02.380
The smaller boat landed us.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.083
We didn't even have to wade water.

04:05.185 --> 04:06.487
It took us so close to the shore.

04:07.328 --> 04:13.918
And we landed in Omaha Beach.

04:15.772 --> 04:17.034
Sun down on June the 7th.

04:17.635 --> 04:19.798
On June the 7th.

04:20.699 --> 04:29.331
And within, we moved up off the beach and onto the land immediately.

04:29.751 --> 04:31.013
Right.

04:31.033 --> 04:34.558
And got out to a bivouac area where we spent the night.

04:35.159 --> 04:37.382
And the next day we started operations.

04:37.542 --> 04:38.383
Started your operations.

04:38.443 --> 04:39.585
Clearing fields.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.516
Now, I want to take it back the day before.

04:41.536 --> 04:46.264
You were supposed to have gone on D-Day, on sundown that day.

04:46.645 --> 04:52.094
But there was a ferry boat that was supposed to have, what, taken you or pushed you to the shore?

04:52.174 --> 04:54.438
And for some reason, you still to this day don't know why.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.099
Never saw it.

04:55.199 --> 04:55.820
You never saw it.

04:56.181 --> 05:00.628
The practice runs we did in England, that was very well done.

05:01.317 --> 05:09.847
The ferry boat would take a whole load from an LST, the big boat, and take them to the shore.

05:10.488 --> 05:14.473
But we never saw that ferry boat again.

05:14.493 --> 05:16.976
About how far offshore were you at this time waiting?

05:17.336 --> 05:24.185
The LST was anchored perhaps a half a mile offshore.

05:24.705 --> 05:29.451
So you were able to see what was going on on the ovation through your field glasses.

05:29.836 --> 05:36.662
I know we're going back nearly 61 years now, but what do you recall about what you saw through those field glasses?

05:36.802 --> 05:40.305
Well, we could see explosions on the shore.

05:41.666 --> 05:44.189
We could hear dimly machine gun fire.

05:45.530 --> 05:54.238
And we could look with field glasses to the right and we could see Pont du Hoc, where General Rudder landed.

05:54.898 --> 05:57.180
We didn't know him then, Adam.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.202
Had never heard of him until after the war.

05:59.840 --> 06:04.770
But we knew that the guns that he took there

06:05.240 --> 06:11.869
could have raped the beach and made it very very difficult to get ashore.

06:11.889 --> 06:23.805
It is bad enough as it was because you've seen the classic pictures of the infantry walking across and as they go some of them fall and die on the spot.

06:25.888 --> 06:29.914
Those people we could see you know with our field glasses right that morning.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.477
Right and then when you did come ashore?

06:32.858 --> 06:34.420
And when you did come ashore

06:34.990 --> 07:04.272
wreckage everywhere no we had a few artillery bursts among us no casualties but there was still some fire there no machine guns they'd already wiped out all the German machine gun nests and stuff up on the hill there and as we went up the hill you've seen that famous trail going up the side of the draw that's the place we went up right there

07:04.657 --> 07:11.947
Just below that, the American dead that had been killed in that were laid out in rows.

07:11.967 --> 07:14.771
Of course, there were lots of dead Germans all over the place.

07:15.733 --> 07:19.918
But they didn't have them nicely laid out in rows.

07:20.179 --> 07:24.124
It was only later that Gray's registration took care of the German dead.

07:24.465 --> 07:25.526
Indeed.

07:25.546 --> 07:25.967
Indeed.

07:26.348 --> 07:33.077
So your young men, the 25 young men that were under you, five tanks, five in each tank, they were...

07:33.817 --> 07:39.522
they were getting a taste of life or as it were death that they maybe weren't prepared for, but they saw it.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.063
Well, they tried to prepare us for that.

07:41.884 --> 07:46.408
We were required to see films of why we fight.

07:47.488 --> 07:49.250
And it showed the death houses.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.674
It showed the devastation of France and Czechoslovakia.

07:53.694 --> 07:57.757
And everyone was required to see those, all the dead people and all that.

07:57.777 --> 08:03.722
But when they began to see real dead people, especially our own soldiers,

08:04.529 --> 08:08.714
They questioned, shall we go up on the hill there and look at that machine gun nest that's been wiped out?

08:09.375 --> 08:10.256
Sure, go on up there.

08:10.836 --> 08:22.850
There were eight or ten Germans had been wiped out by a man I later met and knew how he did that with grenades.

08:24.092 --> 08:27.455
He had to go up that hill somewhere and throw grenades into that machine gun nest.

08:27.896 --> 08:33.102
That machine gun nest no doubt was what was spraying the beach with

08:33.655 --> 08:35.177
machine gun fire.

08:35.197 --> 08:42.225
That's the one that killed most of the invading infantrymen, whom I got to know later.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.889
It's interesting that you talked about Point de Hoc and General Rudder.

08:46.530 --> 08:57.142
Even though you didn't know General Rudder at the time, later when you found out the history of General Rudder and that he, as you looked on your field glasses over there, you'd have known you could have seen that happen.

08:57.162 --> 09:02.008
But later you did get to know General Rudder and his wife Margaret and their family.

09:02.596 --> 09:03.778
Y'all talked about this.

09:03.798 --> 09:04.959
Yes, we did.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.241
We talked about it.

09:06.261 --> 09:07.162
And I talked to her.

09:07.302 --> 09:10.546
And even after he died, I went to see her.

09:10.566 --> 09:11.267
And we visited.

09:11.347 --> 09:14.772
And one or two of his men came back to visit her.

09:15.813 --> 09:17.175
After he died, they kept up with it.

09:17.616 --> 09:18.076
Right.

09:18.096 --> 09:24.324
And I met him in the Army Reserve.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.848
After I came back, I stayed in the Army Reserve.

09:26.868 --> 09:29.591
And he commanded the division that I was in.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.033
So I saw him every summer.

09:31.874 --> 09:56.852
uh off and on for a couple of weeks uh going to summer camp right all those years then uh got a job moved from baylor down to a and m and there he was uh he greeted me at the door so to speak he was glad to see me i bet he was and you him also yeah that's a great part of your story uh let's talk about uh now past d plus one you're on the beach and you're you're moving in

09:56.832 --> 10:00.016
with, I guess, a final goal is to move into Germany.

10:00.056 --> 10:05.702
Talk about the resistance that you encountered, that your group encountered, and sort of the trip into Europe.

10:07.424 --> 10:13.851
On the beach, in the hedgerows, the resistance was infantry.

10:14.292 --> 10:17.235
Not very few tanks got there, German tanks.

10:18.517 --> 10:23.082
Although there were some, and of course they were formidable for us in American tanks.

10:24.143 --> 10:25.945
Our American tanks were not

10:26.498 --> 10:29.522
competitive tank for tank.

10:29.542 --> 10:34.848
Our forte was having more of them and moving faster.

10:35.689 --> 10:38.913
That was the difference between German tanks and American tanks.

10:40.034 --> 10:41.736
And we moved on shore.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.420
It was the job of the infantry to clear those hedgerows.

10:46.622 --> 10:51.948
And I don't know the combat that they had in North Africa.

10:51.968 --> 10:55.392
This was the first infantry division, Africa, Sicily, Italy.

10:55.962 --> 10:59.227
They had plenty of combat ahead of the beach.

11:00.269 --> 11:12.688
And I don't know what they had there, but in the hedgerows, they were perfect cover for infantrymen, and it was a job to clear the fields one or two at a time.

11:13.389 --> 11:16.154
And the tanks helped them immeasurably.

11:16.174 --> 11:21.362
And so they were glad to see us, and we were glad to see them because they protected us.

11:21.983 --> 11:28.278
from the German anti-tank things.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.631
The Panzerfaust and the bazookas, which is the infantryman carrier, which can wipe out a tank.

11:33.952 --> 11:38.423
And we had to have the infantry with us to keep their infantry from knocking out our tank.

11:39.938 --> 11:49.029
I know it was interesting that you told me that when you were moving along with the ground infantry, they'd walk along right beside your tanks.

11:49.069 --> 11:53.355
And you had been trained at Fort Knox to be more spearhead type tanks.

11:53.795 --> 11:55.117
That's not the way it really turned out.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.959
Not the way we did it there.

11:56.979 --> 12:02.667
Immediately we found out that that was not the way we could fight in the hedgerows.

12:02.687 --> 12:06.992
That we had to be moving pillboxes, not armored spearheads.

12:07.580 --> 12:30.583
And we had communication between the ground, the infantryman on the ground had to be such that we put a telephone on the back of the tank so that a sergeant or a lieutenant could run up behind the tank and pick up the telephone and say, there's some Germans down by those trees down there, wipe them out, or we'd spray the trees.

12:30.732 --> 12:32.235
with machine guns and wipe them out.

12:32.255 --> 12:35.942
And they really, our infantry really liked that.

12:35.962 --> 12:37.285
Yeah, the telephone on the back of the tank.

12:37.305 --> 12:40.071
That wasn't something that originated, that was there originally.

12:40.091 --> 12:41.353
That was something you all came up with.

12:41.413 --> 12:44.179
We came up with it and they gave it to us.

12:44.199 --> 12:45.542
They made it available immediately.

12:45.662 --> 12:47.205
We just put an ordinary telephone.

12:47.945 --> 12:49.847
on the back end of the tank.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.388
Right, right.

12:51.569 --> 12:55.492
Sometimes it was a lot of sitting and waiting, as you said.

12:55.512 --> 12:58.515
You told me Montgomery was playing around a little bit and you sat and wait.

12:58.856 --> 13:03.580
I think you went, what, 13 miles in 13 days or something like that?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.842
Yeah, something like that.

13:04.862 --> 13:06.483
We went very, very slowly.

13:07.344 --> 13:15.572
And there was some fighting almost all the way there, the infantry tank cooperation kind of fighting.

13:16.042 --> 13:19.126
Then we got to this town called Cormont, and we sat there.

13:20.168 --> 13:21.950
It took us two or three weeks to get there.

13:22.050 --> 13:28.339
Then we sat there for two or three weeks until they got ready for the so-called breakout at St.

13:28.379 --> 13:28.960
Lowe.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.782
Right, right.

13:30.802 --> 13:33.987
And eventually, I believe, to Auchin, is that right?

13:34.007 --> 13:43.119
Eventually, then after we dashed across France, up the east side of Paris, up to Belgium, and then turned right and moved into Germany at Auchin.

13:43.279 --> 13:43.720
At Auchin.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.456
And arrived there on your birthday, right?

13:46.476 --> 13:47.357
September the 17th.

13:47.437 --> 13:48.278
Yeah, right.

13:48.438 --> 13:48.718
Indeed.

13:49.219 --> 13:52.142
You had a little, you lost a battle with a beer barrel.

13:52.162 --> 13:53.603
You got to tell that story.

13:53.623 --> 14:04.173
Oh, we had not had any R&R recreation in this, from June the 6th to November.

14:05.194 --> 14:06.715
Hadn't had any R&R.

14:07.456 --> 14:10.939
So that's the first time the 1st Division was pulled out of the line.

14:11.206 --> 14:17.113
taken back to the rear areas and given a chance to get their act together.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.015
And of course we had a party.

14:18.956 --> 14:27.567
And we went to the beer cellars, the German beer cellars, and they are cellars, way down under the buildings, to get beer for these parties.

14:28.428 --> 14:32.713
And they carried them out in kegs, just like the kegs we have around the campus here.

14:32.733 --> 14:37.399
And in the darkness in that thing, a guy ahead of me turned around and says,

14:37.784 --> 14:38.665
This thing's pretty heavy.

14:38.685 --> 14:39.906
I believe I'll just drop it here.

14:40.207 --> 14:42.950
So we turned around and dropped it and it hit my foot.

14:43.030 --> 14:45.212
Crushed it completely.

14:45.232 --> 14:52.681
So a couple of days later, after hobbling around, they sent me to the hospital.

14:52.701 --> 14:54.342
They said, your foot's all broken up.

14:54.402 --> 14:57.506
You can't do anything for a while.

14:57.526 --> 14:58.687
You were out for a couple of months.

14:58.867 --> 14:59.488
A couple of months.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.210
I missed the winter fighting.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.749
The coldest part of it.

15:05.330 --> 15:11.016
And I had limited duty.

15:11.376 --> 15:11.636
Right.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.820
A month in the hospital.

15:14.840 --> 15:23.089
And then a month in a replacement depot while I waited to get to wear a boot again.

15:23.429 --> 15:23.809
Right.

15:23.829 --> 15:28.574
And when I got to wear a boot again, then I went back up and joined the same unit.

15:28.835 --> 15:29.155
Yes, sir.

15:29.405 --> 15:34.112
And they were way past, up into mid-Germany by then.

15:35.294 --> 15:39.039
And joined the same unit, had some of the same soldiers with me.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.742
They had lost a few in the meantime.

15:40.762 --> 15:41.663
Indeed.

15:41.683 --> 15:48.033
In fact, they lost the lieutenant who took my place, was killed by artillery fire.

15:48.353 --> 15:48.654
Right.

15:49.956 --> 15:52.660
Came in into the house where he was.

15:52.680 --> 15:58.028
One of those battles I believe was right around Christmas, Christmas Eve night, that that happened also.

15:58.278 --> 16:23.020
you were a tank commander and uh commander and i had five tanks which i commanded besides my own tank right which had uh four men and myself each tank is a crew of five and we had uh radio communication between all the tanks and also with a company commander and uh we didn't have any infantry radio until we got those telephones

16:23.793 --> 16:25.019
Then we got those telephones.

16:25.481 --> 16:26.526
We did a lot better.

16:26.747 --> 16:27.491
Yes, indeed.

16:27.511 --> 16:32.916
The communication, just the communication part of it is you all knew what each of you were doing.

16:32.936 --> 16:33.077
Yeah.

16:33.530 --> 16:41.523
I need to backtrack because you told me a story when we were visiting earlier about that you carried gas masks because of the rumors that the Germans would use gas warfare.

16:41.864 --> 16:45.269
And sometimes there was a mix-up in communication there that caused some problems.

16:45.670 --> 16:46.431
Tell that story.

16:49.316 --> 16:56.027
By the time, on July the 15th or so, we had now...

16:57.155 --> 17:03.703
disembarked 150,000 soldiers or so in a very small area above the beach there.

17:04.183 --> 17:07.968
So there was a soldier over 15 feet, I think, all over the beach.

17:08.869 --> 17:12.693
And communication was mostly by a voice, hollering at each other.

17:14.455 --> 17:23.466
And one night, just after dark, a gasoline truck came up with our gasoline for the tanks.

17:23.615 --> 17:28.920
started unloading it over there, and somebody hollered down the line, hey, here's your gas.

17:28.940 --> 17:34.586
And everybody within hearing, he said, gas attack.

17:35.807 --> 17:38.029
So everybody scrambled for their gas mask.

17:39.071 --> 17:49.521
And I tell the joke, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that my tank and my gas mask was in a muddy field 100 yards away from me.

17:49.771 --> 17:54.397
And I got from where I was to that tank, got my gas mask on, didn't get my feet muddy.

17:55.038 --> 17:57.662
Now, maybe that's not quite true.

17:57.682 --> 17:58.883
You were moving that fast.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.807
Yeah, we were moving that fast because it was a false alarm, of course.

18:02.008 --> 18:02.468
Sure.

18:02.588 --> 18:03.650
We didn't see any gas.

18:03.690 --> 18:05.192
All you heard was the word gas.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.854
Just the word gas came out.

18:06.874 --> 18:11.941
That just meant one thing to you.

18:11.961 --> 18:12.181
Yeah, yeah.

18:12.201 --> 18:13.483
I guess...

18:15.353 --> 18:30.167
The most remarkable experience I had was to see, besides the beach itself, which I got to see a lot of, on the breakthrough on July the 25th, six weeks later at St.

18:30.187 --> 18:38.415
Lowe, we organized to do a breakthrough in Dash for Paris.

18:38.435 --> 18:43.099
That day, the Air Force came over and bombed ahead of us.

18:44.564 --> 18:48.188
3,000 Air Force bombers came over.

18:48.768 --> 18:57.698
We were sitting on a hill behind the line, and these people came over in groups of flights, nine planes to a flight.

18:59.240 --> 19:09.070
And it took them an hour and a half to pass over our head and bomb the part of the German line that we were going to go through.

19:10.855 --> 19:17.684
The noise from those B-17 motors, they came over at 5,000 feet.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.948
And, of course, that's very low.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.914
Any aircraft can knock them out of the sky real quick.

19:25.775 --> 19:33.345
The noise absolutely vibrated the ground in our tank for an hour and a half there.

19:34.406 --> 19:38.652
And we were not in the assault for this breakthrough.

19:38.902 --> 19:40.724
Others were going to do the assault.

19:40.744 --> 19:49.752
We were going to pass through like a halfback going through a hole in the line and make a dash for Paris.

19:49.772 --> 20:06.968
So the first planes that came over, the German 88s raised their guns from anti-tank to anti-aircraft and knocked out three B-17s in that lead part.

20:08.011 --> 20:20.196
But immediately the American artillery observer zeroed in on those anti-tank guns, wiped them out in two minutes.

20:21.418 --> 20:23.202
There were no more anti-aircraft fire.

20:23.637 --> 20:28.083
and the rest of the 3,000 airplanes passed over our head and didn't lose a single one.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.806
That's an incredible story, my goodness.

20:29.866 --> 20:34.212
But I'm told it's one of the greatest air shows that ever happened.

20:34.373 --> 20:35.294
Yes.

20:35.634 --> 20:43.926
But it compared, in terms of a spectacle, it compared very well with the beachhead itself, with the breakout.

20:44.087 --> 20:44.407
Indeed.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.170
The way you describe it, it certainly is.

20:46.710 --> 20:53.340
We want to go to some photographs, some photographs that you have in your home that you have graciously supplied to us.

20:53.641 --> 20:57.565
Not a whole lot of them, but some, and we want to go to them right now.

20:57.585 --> 20:59.286
We're visiting with Colonel Lannis Hope.

20:59.807 --> 21:03.290
This is your shadow box of your awards and some of your medals.

21:03.611 --> 21:10.317
Don't have time to point out every one of them, but we see there sort of in the middle, you see the bronze star.

21:10.698 --> 21:12.239
Talk a little bit about your shadow box.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.785
Well, the bronze star wasn't, that's the fourth level of award for valor.

21:19.206 --> 21:19.446
Right.

21:19.612 --> 21:47.104
the Congressional Medal of Honor being the first, and somewhere to a couple of months down the line from the invasion, those people who had not been nominated for a medal of some kind said, okay, you've been here for two months and you fought and you haven't lost your unit, you haven't made any mistakes, we think you ought to have a bronze star.

21:47.827 --> 21:57.317
So we didn't know it at the time, but having the Bronze Star would give you five extra points on the point scale to get you to go home.

21:57.337 --> 21:58.338
So it was worth it right there?

21:59.258 --> 22:00.099
It was worth it right there?

22:00.119 --> 22:00.780
It was worth it, yeah.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.541
It was worth it right then.

22:01.561 --> 22:12.051
So they gave me the Bronze Star for two months of combat is what it might do.

22:12.672 --> 22:15.775
Let's move on to the next picture.

22:15.923 --> 22:21.608
This is a photograph of you as a member of the Texas Tech band.

22:21.648 --> 22:22.349
Is that correct?

22:22.369 --> 22:23.110
I believe that's right.

22:23.130 --> 22:25.572
And you're the second one from the left in that picture.

22:25.592 --> 22:27.434
We haven't talked a lot about you as a musician.

22:27.454 --> 22:29.576
We're going to get to that as we have time.

22:29.636 --> 22:31.878
You were a member of the Texas Tech band back in the 1940s.

22:32.939 --> 22:36.262
And that's quite a section right there.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.204
And you're the second one from the left.

22:38.644 --> 22:39.385
You played the trumpet.

22:40.866 --> 22:40.966
Yeah.

22:40.986 --> 22:41.827
And still do.

22:41.847 --> 22:42.107
Yeah.

22:42.407 --> 22:43.028
And still do.

22:44.020 --> 22:48.655
There's your glamour shot as a member of the Texas Tech band.

22:48.675 --> 22:50.220
The Texas Tech uniform, yeah.

22:52.226 --> 22:55.617
They had shortly got those new uniforms.

22:56.525 --> 22:58.509
Were they called the Red Raiders back then?

22:58.669 --> 23:00.834
Did they call themselves the Red Raiders back then?

23:00.854 --> 23:01.555
No, the Matadors.

23:01.616 --> 23:02.858
They were Red Raiders, yes.

23:03.199 --> 23:06.185
They were also the Matadors, I believe, early.

23:06.225 --> 23:07.849
Okay, let's move on.

23:07.889 --> 23:14.823
I think we have a picture of your unit that was taken before D-Day.

23:15.364 --> 23:16.727
That's the officers of the Union.

23:17.618 --> 23:20.702
You were the back row, second one from the right, I believe.

23:20.722 --> 23:21.844
Is that correct?

23:21.964 --> 23:28.313
The two Texans who were second and third on the left side were killed in action.

23:30.636 --> 23:39.268
This was a studio-type picture taken by every unit prior to D-Day, knowing that we'd lose a lot of these people.

23:39.288 --> 23:43.114
And this was a good one to keep forever.

23:43.775 --> 23:44.115
Yes.

23:44.332 --> 23:45.934
Indeed, and you have all the names there.

23:46.454 --> 23:47.776
And again, I believe you're, is that right?

23:47.796 --> 23:49.297
You're the back row, second one from the right.

23:49.437 --> 23:49.598
Yeah.

23:50.439 --> 23:50.699
Yeah.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.384
Okay, let's move on to, there's a couple of photographs.

23:55.404 --> 23:57.346
There's a dashing young soldier there.

23:58.827 --> 23:59.228
Okay.

23:59.488 --> 24:01.731
Looked like a movie star.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.053
That looks like a Hollywood picture right there on the left.

24:04.373 --> 24:06.736
That's a peacetime thing before I went overseas.

24:08.358 --> 24:12.482
On the left, just after I'd finished OCS at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

24:13.188 --> 24:18.316
came back through Texas and going to the California desert, where I stayed for six months.

24:19.298 --> 24:30.876
Then I came back to Texas again, and lo and behold, that's when the girl I've been going with off and on for two years, and we got married.

24:30.896 --> 24:32.118
And that's a picture of us.

24:32.138 --> 24:32.559
That's Peggy.

24:32.579 --> 24:33.500
On the wedding.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.143
And Lana's Hope.

24:35.163 --> 24:36.705
What a great looking young couple.

24:37.367 --> 24:37.507
Yeah.

24:37.988 --> 24:38.568
That's wonderful.

24:38.789 --> 24:40.832
That's some great photographs.

24:41.470 --> 24:49.118
The war, like everybody in Europe, after the Germans surrendered, everybody was getting ready to go to Japan.

24:49.138 --> 24:53.342
Then the bomb was dropped and the conflict ended.

24:53.943 --> 25:03.232
You came back home, you were in the reserves for a while, but you pursued a career in music as a band director, but then you had to give that up.

25:03.653 --> 25:03.933
Yeah.

25:04.394 --> 25:05.875
Right.

25:06.580 --> 25:11.326
I didn't know it, but my hearing had been severely damaged in the war.

25:11.346 --> 25:12.208
Many reasons for that.

25:12.228 --> 25:25.045
I won't go into that, but my discharge doctor verified that I had a hearing loss, but they didn't know it would affect my music.

25:25.065 --> 25:33.516
But after I'd been working as a band director for a couple of years, they decided I was handicapped that I should do something else besides the band.

25:33.850 --> 25:41.831
Well, that's when I went into a graduate program in psychology at Tech and at University of Texas, where I got my PhD.

25:42.132 --> 25:43.295
Right, right.

25:43.315 --> 25:45.160
And you worked in Austin, you worked in Waco.

25:45.477 --> 25:53.550
at Baylor University as a, I believe you said, as assistant dean in charge of residence halls, which involved a little psychology in itself.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.773
Yes, I used it.

25:55.793 --> 25:56.855
I used to be in a residence hall.

25:56.895 --> 26:00.060
I know that that could involve a little counseling.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.504
But then you came to Texas A&M in the early 60s.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.165
Is that right?

26:04.006 --> 26:04.086
Yes.

26:04.106 --> 26:07.772
And talk briefly about why you came here and what you did.

26:07.812 --> 26:10.817
And people didn't really understand what your role was here for a while.

26:11.157 --> 26:11.738
Well,

26:12.072 --> 26:16.057
Texas A&M was 6,000 male students all in the Corps.

26:17.439 --> 26:17.559
Right.

26:17.579 --> 26:19.462
And they had been that way for many, many years.

26:20.042 --> 26:24.408
And the vestiges of a counseling center were here.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.733
They called it the basic division.

26:28.753 --> 26:41.590
And they had a couple of psychologists, reading specialists and things like that to help with academic advising and things like that.

26:42.093 --> 26:47.240
But they had one counseling psychologist, and he departed.

26:47.260 --> 26:48.862
He was a colleague of mine at Texas.

26:49.783 --> 26:55.010
And this job came open, and I applied for it and got it.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.675
And you were a counselor at Texas A&M for several years, right?

26:58.695 --> 26:59.436
Yes, 10 years.

27:00.097 --> 27:00.358
For 10 years?

27:00.378 --> 27:03.342
I spent, well, longer than that, 61 to 86.

27:03.882 --> 27:04.163
Right.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.565
25 years.

27:05.905 --> 27:06.506
Indeed.

27:06.706 --> 27:07.026
Indeed.

27:07.046 --> 27:08.809
You had been 10 years in Waco, I believe.

27:08.889 --> 27:09.850
Yeah, 10 years in Waco.

27:10.030 --> 27:10.631
Before that.

27:10.912 --> 27:11.172
Yeah.

27:11.253 --> 27:18.360
You were raised in West Texas near Lubbock, went to Borger High School, I believe it was, a child of the Depression, right?

27:18.380 --> 27:20.322
Yeah.

27:22.184 --> 27:27.549
I had not much to do with the military, although at Texas Tech I was in ROTC.

27:27.890 --> 27:29.451
Right.

27:29.471 --> 27:40.382
And even though it was only a year, that gave me a little bit of up when they mobilized the 36th Division for wartime.

27:40.801 --> 27:44.927
That mobilization came about before Pearl Harbor.

27:46.349 --> 27:49.894
And immediately we mobilized for one year.

27:50.936 --> 27:53.259
But of course we didn't get away for five years.

27:54.501 --> 28:00.649
And a lot of Texas Tech students knew this one year and they were not going to get drafted.

28:01.030 --> 28:05.236
So a bunch of us joined, particularly in the band.

28:05.256 --> 28:08.040
We joined this military band so we would play.

28:08.122 --> 28:09.704
for our military career.

28:10.024 --> 28:10.285
Right.

28:10.705 --> 28:14.950
And not knowing that we would all be pretty active.

28:14.970 --> 28:21.739
Most of us eventually went to the Air Force or went to OCS and took commissions and fought the war.

28:21.759 --> 28:22.340
Indeed you did.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.301
And we're glad that you did.

28:23.321 --> 28:23.661
Thank you.

28:23.681 --> 28:26.385
And we're out of time, but thank you very much for your service, Colonel Hope.

28:27.105 --> 28:27.226
Right.

28:27.246 --> 28:30.129
Colonel Lannis Hope is Brazos County's only witness to D-Day.

28:30.309 --> 28:34.855
His service to our country then and to his community now are indeed our reward.

28:35.189 --> 28:40.022
We thank Lannis Hope for his service and to our underwriter, First National Bank.

28:40.042 --> 28:41.025
I'm Tom Turveyville.

28:41.105 --> 28:58.412
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
