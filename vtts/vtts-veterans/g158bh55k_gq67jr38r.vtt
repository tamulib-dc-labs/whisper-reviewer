00:34.182 --> 00:35.777
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.098 --> 00:37.101
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.843 --> 00:45.006
When Gerald McCaskill boarded the battleship USS Tennessee in June of 1944, it was the first ship that he had ever seen.

00:45.560 --> 00:51.749
He would see plenty of it over the next 15 months, including combat action throughout World War II's Pacific Theater.

00:52.289 --> 01:04.507
The Tennessee had already seen plenty of warfare, including on 7 December 1941, Dr. Pearl Harbor alongside the ill-fated West Virginia and Arizona on that day that will live in infamy.

01:05.268 --> 01:12.698
Over his time on the Tennessee, its travels took it to Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Guadalcanal, Peleliu,

01:12.998 --> 01:21.087
the Philippines, back to Pearl Harbor, Saipan, and within a mile of the beaches of Iwo Jima for that Marine invasion to Mount Suribachi.

01:21.107 --> 01:23.130
On to Okinawa and eventually to Japan.

01:23.170 --> 01:31.279
The Tennessee was badly damaged at least twice after the attack on Pearl Harbor, an attack at Tinian, later a suicide attack to the quarter day.

01:31.980 --> 01:36.745
Gerald McCaskill has a story to tell, and we are proud to welcome him to Veterans of the Valley.

01:37.113 --> 01:40.878
Gerald, it is an honor to have you here on Veterans of the Valley, and again, thank you for your service.

01:41.419 --> 01:43.021
I want to move you right out of high school.

01:43.041 --> 01:51.853
You went to Centerville High School, and it was either stay and do farming with your dad, get a job, or do what the inevitable was, and that was going to the service.

01:51.873 --> 01:53.796
You knew you were going to get drafted, so you joined the Navy.

01:54.237 --> 01:58.783
Talk about that, and you had a very quick training before you went on to the Pacific.

01:59.163 --> 02:00.285
Yeah, I did.

02:02.189 --> 02:26.610
I had just a menial job after I got out of high school with a geophysical crew and knew that eventually I would be drafted and at that time you could make a choice as to what branch of the service you wanted to be in.

02:27.350 --> 02:38.383
I kind of thought maybe the Navy might be okay because, you know, it was dry and not much mud on the ship and so forth.

02:38.403 --> 02:51.158
But anyway, I went in March 14, I believe in 1944 and was sent to San Diego, California for my training.

02:51.819 --> 02:53.661
And normally you have,

02:55.447 --> 02:57.390
about three months of boot camp.

02:57.410 --> 03:13.135
Well, we had six weeks, and I never knew why, except we had, after our boot camp, we had one week of work detail, which was entailed

03:13.115 --> 03:16.358
stenciling clothes for the new recruits.

03:16.939 --> 03:26.870
And of course, having been in six weeks, we thought we were pretty big fellas because we did a lot of shouting at them and so forth.

03:26.890 --> 03:35.559
But anyway, after that, we boarded a troop transport and went to Hawaii.

03:36.160 --> 03:42.126
And we were aboard, I don't remember the name of the old troop transport,

03:42.612 --> 03:54.733
But once we got to Hawaii, they mustered us around on the island, and we were there about three or four days before they made assignments.

03:55.594 --> 04:02.005
And there was quite a few sailors in the group, and most of them were all brand-new recruits.

04:02.575 --> 04:15.190
So they divided them up among the ships that needed help, and it so happened that I got the Tennessee, which as it turned out, I was happy that I did.

04:16.011 --> 04:16.712
What was your job?

04:17.513 --> 04:25.022
Well, during battle, I was in damage control, which

04:27.112 --> 04:32.683
was a matter of when we had damage to the ship,

04:33.254 --> 04:48.917
lines or decking or whatever, we tried to stop the flow of water or oil or whatever was in the compartment until they could get some of the specialists to come and repair it.

04:49.959 --> 05:02.738
And I remember, of course Saipan was where we got hit, and one of the shells hit one of our five-inch batteries,

05:02.718 --> 05:05.281
and killed everybody in it.

05:06.122 --> 05:17.297
And then another one hit just above the water line and one hit on the quarter deck above our compartment where our battle station was.

05:17.998 --> 05:23.304
And it just so happened that it hit the spud locker.

05:24.226 --> 05:25.147
Where the potatoes were kept.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.869
Where they stored the potatoes.

05:27.153 --> 05:37.363
and also broke a salt water line and our compartment was filling up pretty fast with potatoes and water.

05:37.383 --> 05:53.700
So we got the water stopped and then of course then our duty was pretty much over as far as that was concerned and nobody in our compartment was hurt or injured anyway.

05:54.237 --> 06:04.585
in that campaign, but I think we lost seven died and about 25 or six injured.

06:05.037 --> 06:07.760
So the ones that died were the ones that were around that 5-inch?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.102
In that 5-inch mount.

06:09.222 --> 06:10.223
In that 5-inch mount.

06:10.243 --> 06:10.964
A gun, yeah.

06:11.144 --> 06:11.785
Right.

06:13.788 --> 06:28.986
Excuse me, I'm not sure how many people, what the complement was, was a 5-inch, but anyway, they were killed instantly and the mount was on fire.

06:29.658 --> 06:32.601
About how many sailors were on the Tennessee at this time?

06:32.621 --> 06:34.703
We had about almost 2,000.

06:34.843 --> 06:35.344
Wow.

06:35.364 --> 06:39.227
That's officers, men, and cooks.

06:39.848 --> 06:40.889
So it's like a small town.

06:41.369 --> 06:42.110
Yes, it was.

06:42.230 --> 06:54.903
And we had a barber shop, of course, which they didn't have to be specialists to be barbers in the Navy.

06:55.483 --> 06:59.547
But we had a commissary where you could requisition

06:59.881 --> 07:29.820
clothes or supplies or whatever and get sometimes they'd have candy and we had an ice cream maker that you could get a little ice cream occasionally but most generally you just took the child that they gave you and when I first went aboard and before they assigned me to a division or a group I was just hanging loose and

07:30.762 --> 07:47.978
I had to sleep in my hammock in the mess hall, which wasn't a great deal of fun, but we got to wake up early because the cooks would come in and they'd start hollering at you or turn over your hammock.

07:49.848 --> 08:01.163
And after that, I got, of course, I got assigned to the R Division, which was one of the biggest groups of men on the ship.

08:01.183 --> 08:11.196
And like I say, they had ship fitters and pipe fitters and carpenters and metal workers.

08:11.937 --> 08:15.261
And we even had the band was in our division.

08:15.401 --> 08:15.682
Wow.

08:16.142 --> 08:18.165
Had a pretty good little band.

08:18.185 --> 08:18.285
Sure.

08:18.265 --> 08:24.414
You'd only been in the Navy three months when this first attack happened.

08:24.794 --> 08:27.859
You'd been on the ship probably less than a month, I guess.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.962
What did you think?

08:30.042 --> 08:34.929
I mean, had you envisioned that the action was going to start up that quick?

08:34.949 --> 08:35.530
Well, no.

08:37.072 --> 08:43.041
Before we left Pearl Harbor to go to the Marianas,

08:43.915 --> 08:51.732
I was, a friend of mine from New York and I were just hanging out.

08:51.752 --> 08:55.981
And we didn't know they were going to have gunnery practice.

08:57.104 --> 09:02.295
But all of a sudden those 14-inch guns started firing.

09:02.866 --> 09:07.532
We didn't know what to do, except we tried to find a place to go.

09:10.795 --> 09:24.392
But it was overwhelming for me not having had any experience or not actually knowing anything about what was going on as far as being aboard a ship.

09:24.692 --> 09:25.933
Right, right.

09:25.953 --> 09:30.679
You told me about a, later on, as we move on, you told me about a,

09:31.435 --> 09:35.370
situation involving Admiral Halsey being used as a decoy.

09:35.755 --> 09:37.156
Well, that was in the Philippines.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.758
Later on in the Philippines, right?

09:38.778 --> 09:40.580
Yeah.

09:40.600 --> 09:50.410
We had already, you know, landed and the ships were patrolling the Philippines and the East China Sea.

09:51.891 --> 10:00.259
And the 7th Division, which was what we were in, had six old battleships.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.062
And the 2nd Division,

10:04.612 --> 10:30.957
second fleet had all the new ones you know they were swifter and faster and had bigger guns and and that was uh halsey's command right well there was as i understand it from reading now there was a kind of a

10:34.092 --> 10:43.784
build up of the Japanese fleet to come back to the Philippines and retake what they had lost.

10:43.804 --> 10:52.615
And there was rumor, I assume, that they got intelligence that the fleet was north.

10:53.596 --> 10:59.003
And so Halsey wanted to score a big hit and he took all the big ships, the new ships.

10:59.742 --> 11:10.919
and the carriers and so forth, and headed north to intercept them, which left us there at the Philippines.

11:11.800 --> 11:16.728
Well, that was exactly what the Japanese wanted to do.

11:16.748 --> 11:27.825
They wanted to get the Halsey out of the way, and we were under the command of Ollendorf, Admiral Ollendorf.

11:28.885 --> 11:39.363
And we got, I assume we had intelligence that told us that the fleet, Japanese fleet, was coming through Surigao Straits.

11:41.026 --> 11:47.097
And so he or somebody designed a plan whereby

11:47.667 --> 11:54.800
the ship would intercept these Japanese fleet coming in this narrow strait.

11:54.820 --> 12:04.397
And the first group that attacked them was the PT boats.

12:05.038 --> 12:09.406
And then they come on down and the destroyers started peppering them.

12:10.408 --> 12:12.291
And by then, our ships,

12:12.760 --> 12:37.097
battleships were stationed across crossways so that we could fire all of our guns the japanese coming straight ahead could only fire their forward guns so we had them at a disadvantage and it didn't take too long for them to turn tail and get out of there well of course when they turn

12:39.811 --> 12:42.555
We got after them again pretty good.

12:44.318 --> 12:47.463
But I think the California was one of our ships.

12:48.104 --> 12:50.327
I don't think she got a shot off.

12:50.347 --> 12:50.768
Is that right?

12:50.808 --> 12:52.330
No, I don't know that.

12:52.691 --> 12:57.038
We've got a picture coming up, as a matter of fact, that's going to show both the Tennessee and the California in just a minute.

12:57.699 --> 12:59.822
I want to fast forward here a little bit.

13:00.623 --> 13:07.033
The battleship Tennessee had to go back to Seattle for its major repairs after the attack, and you got to go home.

13:07.216 --> 13:10.186
or what you hoped had been 30 days, but it turned out not to be 30 days.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.099
You were called back earlier, but you were able to make your way back to Centerville, right?

13:14.179 --> 13:14.721
Probably did.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.952
Yeah, we moved into our...

13:18.100 --> 13:26.336
came to Bremerton, Washington, which is across the bay from Seattle, and they gave two leave.

13:26.396 --> 13:40.142
We were there to be there 60 days, and they issued orders for two leave groups, and of course, not having had much time in the Navy, I was able to

13:40.122 --> 13:44.709
secure one of the last leaves.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.492
So you got to go home for 30 days.

13:46.512 --> 13:48.355
I got to go home for 30 days.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.678
But it wasn't quite 30 days and you were called back.

13:50.698 --> 13:51.900
No, they wired us.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.404
And of course, I lived way out in the country.

13:56.447 --> 13:59.612
And they wired Centerville.

13:59.632 --> 14:00.413
Right.

14:00.433 --> 14:05.260
And I had an uncle living there and he got the telegram and brought it out to us.

14:05.361 --> 14:06.923
And so I headed back.

14:07.645 --> 14:15.934
Headed back, back on the Tennessee to the Philippines patrolling the East China Sea and then eventually to Iwo Jima.

14:15.994 --> 14:17.355
To Iwo Jima.

14:18.917 --> 14:23.101
Tell us a little bit about the Tennessee's role in the attack on Iwo Jima.

14:23.121 --> 14:26.605
Obviously you were offshore and you were providing cover for the Marines, right?

14:26.725 --> 14:27.445
Well, that's true.

14:27.846 --> 14:33.652
And that was our basic program in any of the invasions.

14:34.292 --> 14:36.775
Normally we went in about five days

14:37.261 --> 14:53.591
in advance of the landings to fire and they had spotter planes that would detect and direct fire into the gun mounts and so forth.

14:54.433 --> 14:58.881
And so we would stand off, we would, usually we would

14:59.266 --> 15:13.763
fire for an hour from the starboard side, then we'd swing around and fire from the port side, and we had two crews, the port and starboard crew, and they'd get to rest a little while.

15:14.964 --> 15:21.231
I want to go ahead and go to the pictures now because I wanted to just mention your service at Iwo Jima because we have some photographs.

15:21.271 --> 15:22.473
Let's go ahead and go to those.

15:22.673 --> 15:23.774
How old were you in this picture?

15:24.335 --> 15:26.117
I was 18.

15:26.603 --> 15:32.891
So this is at the start of your... Well, actually, you finished high school at 16, so you'd been in the service a while, right?

15:33.151 --> 15:47.790
Well, before my 18th birthday, I had been at Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Philippines, and the Battle of Surgao Strait.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.432
So you were an experienced sailor here.

15:49.452 --> 15:53.978
Yeah, and you know, you come back and you've got a ribbon with all the damn stars on it.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.345
What's the matter with you, boy?

15:59.365 --> 16:02.068
And you were proud to explain what those were all about.

16:02.088 --> 16:03.791
There's the Tennessee right there.

16:03.811 --> 16:11.060
Now, this is a photograph taken in July of 19, or actually this was off Port Angeles, Washington.

16:11.961 --> 16:23.475
Before you had boarded there, this is sort of the early version before Pearl Harbor, but I just thought that was an excellent photograph that was taken from a book that you have called USS Tennessee in World War II by Clifton Simmons.

16:23.793 --> 16:27.817
And the photographs you're about to see are all coming from that book.

16:28.878 --> 16:34.544
This is another photograph, sort of up close, the casemat deck and the three-inch guns.

16:35.505 --> 16:37.247
But that's sort of an early version.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.209
It didn't look quite like that, right?

16:39.229 --> 16:40.450
The five-inch guns, excuse me.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.174
Well, it did not look like that when I went aboard.

16:44.374 --> 16:44.674
Right.

16:44.874 --> 16:48.398
It had more enclosed superstructure.

16:48.718 --> 16:49.819
That was early on.

16:49.999 --> 16:50.200
Yeah.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.563
Now we're going to move to Pearl Harbor.

16:53.729 --> 16:54.450
Right.

16:54.470 --> 16:59.997
This is December 10th, three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

17:00.558 --> 17:08.008
And what you're seeing there is the Tennessee right beside the remains, the sunken West Virginia.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.651
And this photo was taken from the hull of the Oklahoma.

17:11.973 --> 17:20.825
And again, this was before you had boarded, but this is the battleship that you would board and spend 15 months on.

17:20.845 --> 17:21.205
Yeah, right.

17:22.349 --> 17:23.890
Okay, move on to the next one.

17:24.171 --> 17:26.913
This is fresh from the rebuild after Pearl Harbor.

17:28.495 --> 17:37.083
Well, if you notice, Tom, about midway down, there's some what we call blisters.

17:37.183 --> 17:38.425
Those were added.

17:38.445 --> 17:40.567
Right, right, afterwards.

17:41.347 --> 17:49.375
It's amazing, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it was up and going and repaired in about three months' time, or a little less than three months' time.

17:49.395 --> 17:51.377
This next photograph is...

17:51.880 --> 17:53.102
It's a fascinating photograph.

17:53.222 --> 17:58.289
June 18, 1944, you are now on the ship under fire at Saipan.

17:58.309 --> 17:59.971
And this is the photograph I was referring to.

18:00.031 --> 18:01.894
I think this is the Tennessee in the foreground.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.160
And in the background on the right, that's the California.

18:08.643 --> 18:10.966
California and Tennessee were sister ships.

18:11.126 --> 18:12.508
I see, in the same place.

18:12.669 --> 18:14.811
They were laid down at about the same time.

18:15.272 --> 18:19.017
I think they were completed in 1920.

18:19.378 --> 18:21.060
I'm not sure.

18:21.445 --> 18:25.111
This is Admiral Nimitz, and this was on 17 October 1944.

18:25.291 --> 18:33.784
I bet you can recall when he came on board to address the... Yeah, in fact, the captain, that's our captain on the left.

18:34.165 --> 18:37.790
I don't recognize those other guys.

18:38.892 --> 18:45.302
But that was quite a time when the leader was there, the main man.

18:45.322 --> 18:49.008
He really didn't particularly want to have the Admiral.

18:49.028 --> 18:49.208
Right.

18:49.492 --> 18:54.560
on your ship because you had to tow the mark a little.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.361
Oh, I bet you did.

18:55.381 --> 18:56.142
A lot of scrubbing going on.

18:56.162 --> 18:58.886
We were flagship several times.

18:59.086 --> 19:00.669
A lot of cleanup before he came on.

19:00.729 --> 19:06.818
Yeah, and you know, of course, most of those guys were just regular people.

19:07.118 --> 19:08.280
Exactly.

19:08.300 --> 19:08.981
Folks.

19:09.762 --> 19:10.403
Exactly.

19:10.957 --> 19:12.239
This is at Iwo Jima.

19:12.479 --> 19:20.231
The date is 19 February 1945, as I guess the Tennessee is positioning itself for the attack.

19:20.271 --> 19:29.485
Well, you can see that those are probably LCTs going in, I would guess.

19:30.566 --> 19:34.973
We've had veterans that were actually, Ed Eyre is a veteran who actually was a Marine that

19:35.543 --> 19:51.931
was there at D-Day at Iwo Jima, and he remembers looking out onto the waters and said, I've never seen so many crafts in his whole life, so many ships and boats and cruisers and destroyers, and Tennessee was one of them.

19:53.513 --> 19:55.817
This photograph and the next one are fascinating.

19:55.857 --> 19:59.063
We have not talked yet about this.

19:59.163 --> 19:59.583
We will.

19:59.844 --> 20:01.146
In 1945,

20:01.565 --> 20:08.753
The next major attack to the Tennessee was a suicide plane that found its mark.

20:08.773 --> 20:16.262
And these first two photographs on the left or the right, this is just seconds before the suicide plane hit at the quarter deck.

20:17.583 --> 20:22.028
And that's the moment of impact right there of the suicide plane hitting the Tennessee.

20:23.430 --> 20:29.817
And in a moment, we're going to get you to talk about that because this came in April the 12th, 1945.

20:31.771 --> 20:35.215
And those pictures were actually still shots taken from a film.

20:36.016 --> 20:39.980
And finally, talk about, you're on the bottom left, and talk about this picture.

20:40.901 --> 20:49.191
Well, these were some guys that I worked with in the first lieutenant's office and the damage control group.

20:49.211 --> 20:53.256
The kid on the right was from Nacogdoches.

20:53.276 --> 20:55.378
His name was Cyril Roberts.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.803
And Don Hampton on the left back,

21:00.273 --> 21:04.667
And Joe Martinez, he was from New Orleans.

21:04.868 --> 21:05.791
Right.

21:05.811 --> 21:08.740
And I never heard from any of them afterward.

21:08.780 --> 21:12.713
I know that Martinez is dead, and I would guess that Hampton...

21:13.570 --> 21:15.653
probably, he was older.

21:15.933 --> 21:16.674
Right.

21:16.694 --> 21:20.900
But the guy from Nacogdoches, I finally tracked him down.

21:21.040 --> 21:21.300
Really?

21:21.981 --> 21:22.222
Really?

21:22.802 --> 21:26.988
But he had multiple strokes.

21:27.108 --> 21:27.909
I see.

21:28.210 --> 21:33.036
I talked to his wife and wrote him a letter and sent him this picture.

21:33.977 --> 21:36.460
And she said, well, he smiled.

21:36.481 --> 21:37.362
That's wonderful.

21:37.382 --> 21:38.003
That's wonderful.

21:38.023 --> 21:38.523
That's great.

21:39.144 --> 21:41.367
Matter of fact, you just returned from a...

21:41.768 --> 21:46.095
from a reunion in South Dakota that I know that you are very excited about.

21:46.115 --> 21:48.980
You have a reunion every year and folks get together.

21:49.000 --> 21:49.521
Yeah, we do.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.664
You've got about 85, including spouses, right?

21:51.684 --> 21:52.165
That's right.

21:52.486 --> 22:04.165
And South Dakota doesn't seem like the appropriate place to have a ship reunion, but what they try to do is pass it around

22:04.634 --> 22:10.640
to different parts of the country so that guys don't have to travel as far every time.

22:11.742 --> 22:14.124
Next year, it's in Knoxville, Tennessee.

22:14.665 --> 22:14.985
I see.

22:16.447 --> 22:23.634
We saw the photographs, and I want you to talk about April the 12th, 1945, which also coincidentally happened to be the day that FDR died.

22:23.674 --> 22:25.096
That's correct.

22:25.977 --> 22:33.865
We just have about five minutes left, but I want you to talk about that attack and how you all survived it because not everybody did.

22:34.064 --> 22:57.675
Well, no, the planes, of course, came in from off the starboard bow, the one that hit us, and I think we shot down four or five before they got that close, but this one made it in, and he hit the yard arm off the bridge,

22:58.027 --> 23:26.076
and then tumbled down and hit several of the open gun mounts and killed 26, I think, that day, and injured maybe 100, 120 people, but had a bomb, and it hit on the quarter deck just above our compartment, so we had another, didn't have any potatoes, but we had

23:26.579 --> 23:27.500
a lot of damage.

23:27.540 --> 23:37.030
We had, as I remember, we had some oil lines and we also had the water lines that we had to take care of.

23:38.231 --> 23:40.974
And nobody in our compartment was hit again.

23:40.994 --> 23:43.096
So we were fortunate, very fortunate.

23:43.116 --> 23:44.558
You were discharged in April of 1946.

23:45.218 --> 23:47.621
We are running out of time, so we're going to have to move forward.

23:47.661 --> 23:51.925
But you did decide to come back rather than go to work at the farm, came back and you went to Texas A&M.

23:51.945 --> 23:54.628
And it was kind of tough for you because you hadn't been to school for four years.

23:55.098 --> 24:02.829
And it was kind of tough going, but you all decided rather than go back to the farm to stick with it, and you graduated in four years from Texas A&M.

24:02.849 --> 24:16.127
I did because I graduated in four years because I had to take 18 hours per semester to get all the credits in because my time at GI Bill would have run out.

24:16.428 --> 24:16.990
Right.

24:17.011 --> 24:19.542
And I didn't have any money to go.

24:19.662 --> 24:26.151
So, yeah, to me, the GI Bill was one of the best things that they ever.

24:27.447 --> 24:32.534
You graduated from A&M in 1950, and that's the same year that you married Shirley.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.155
I sure did.

24:33.535 --> 24:34.857
I lucked out there.

24:34.877 --> 24:36.059
You lucked out there, indeed.

24:36.119 --> 24:50.338
And then your career took you to West Texas, to the Panhandle, to Lubbock, and eventually to Andrews, where you were in the banking business for some 30-something years, where you were kind of Mr. Andrews, I get the idea, the president of the Chamber of Commerce.

24:50.559 --> 24:55.125
You know, if you're in a small town and can't say no, you get to do a lot of things that

24:55.966 --> 24:59.410
But it did take up a lot of time, but I enjoyed it.

25:00.692 --> 25:06.880
Andrews was probably one of the best small towns that we ever lived in.

25:06.900 --> 25:11.165
Hereford, we lived in Hereford for a while, and it was a good town.

25:11.986 --> 25:17.333
Eventually you retired and you came back to the area, back to the Leon area.

25:17.701 --> 25:26.011
But then because of health problems, because of heart problems, you wanted to get near some good doctors, and that's sort of what brought you back to the town of your alma mater, to College Station.

25:26.031 --> 25:32.739
Well, that and we have a place up in Leon County that we needed to look after.

25:32.899 --> 25:38.466
And at the time, you know, we had one of our sons lived in the woodlands.

25:39.347 --> 25:42.190
One lived in Georgetown.

25:43.013 --> 25:46.778
The daughter lived in Denver, and of course that was out of the picture.

25:46.798 --> 25:50.563
So this was near, and so we felt comfortable here.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.726
And this is another.

25:52.866 --> 25:54.989
We've never lived in a place we didn't like.

25:56.011 --> 25:59.215
We've always enjoyed everywhere we've ever lived.

25:59.235 --> 26:02.900
And College Station is a fine town.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.601
Indeed it is.

26:03.621 --> 26:04.522
And we're glad to have you.

26:04.602 --> 26:07.747
You and Shirley have seven grandkids and one great grandchild.

26:07.927 --> 26:08.628
One great.

26:08.648 --> 26:11.191
And I know that you're proud of them, and they're all proud of you.

26:11.972 --> 26:12.053
Yep.

26:12.073 --> 26:12.413
Indeed.

26:12.967 --> 26:15.971
We're just about out of time, but I want to thank you very, very much for your service.

26:15.991 --> 26:23.019
The time goes very, very quickly, but I want to thank you for your service in your retirement and College Station.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.681
I know you and Shirley are enjoying it.

26:24.701 --> 26:24.901
Thank you.

26:24.981 --> 26:25.162
We are.

26:25.262 --> 26:27.164
We've done a lot of traveling.

26:27.625 --> 26:28.125
Indeed.

26:28.145 --> 26:30.488
And you plan to continue to do traveling, I hope.

26:30.989 --> 26:33.772
Yeah, as long as the old wings stay vertical.

26:35.634 --> 26:36.395
That's the idea.

26:36.615 --> 26:37.737
Hang in there.

26:37.757 --> 26:38.317
Thank you, Gerald.

26:38.337 --> 26:39.158
Thank you for your service.

26:39.919 --> 26:40.560
Thank you for being with us.

26:41.418 --> 26:52.634
The stick-with-it attitude that Gerald McCaskill used to get through Texas A&M was certainly acquired by his brave service aboard the USS Tennessee from June of 44 to September of 45.

26:53.094 --> 27:01.106
BB-43 to Tennessee was certainly a proud ship that served from Pearl Harbor and beyond, and Gerald McCaskill was later one of his proud sailors.

27:01.546 --> 27:05.051
We salute Gerald McCaskill for his World War II service.

27:05.071 --> 27:07.915
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:08.563 --> 27:13.134
[Silence.]

27:14.000 --> 27:24.000
[Music.]

27:24.000 --> 27:35.000
