00:31.275 --> 00:34.669
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.231
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.869 --> 00:57.073
This week and next week, you will hear just part of the incredible story of service of 1st Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey O'Brien, a 20-year Army veteran who served overseas in Germany twice in Korea and two tours of Vietnam, first with the 18th Army of Vietnam Infantry and later with the 12th Cav.

00:57.654 --> 01:04.362
He was wounded during each Vietnam deployment, earning two Purple Hearts and the Silver Star, among many other awards and medals.

01:04.730 --> 01:17.082
Between his Vietnam tours, he served on the streets of Southside Chicago, helping to defuse the devastating riots in the days following the April 4th, 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

01:17.662 --> 01:21.646
He also served three years at Fort Greeley, Alaska, on the edge of the Arctic Circle.

01:22.206 --> 01:24.949
As you can imagine, his is a remarkable story of service.

01:25.470 --> 01:28.352
And we welcome Jeffrey Bailey to Veterans of the Valley.

01:28.693 --> 01:30.855
Jeffrey, thank you for being with us.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.437
It's an honor to know you and to talk to you.

01:33.721 --> 01:35.284
Let's get you into the service.

01:35.324 --> 01:37.387
I know you grew up in Benchley just down the road.

01:37.407 --> 01:46.162
You graduated from high school in Hearn in 1951 and entered the service in December of 1952, went to Fort Hood for your basic.

01:46.182 --> 01:48.786
And first overseas deployment was Germany.

01:48.907 --> 01:57.220
Talk about that because you told me that Germany was a good place for the American soldier to be at this time because it was only eight years removed from World War II.

01:57.521 --> 01:58.142
Talk about that.

01:58.358 --> 01:59.299
Oh, that's correct.

01:59.359 --> 02:02.123
It was a wonderful place to be.

02:03.164 --> 02:07.530
The beginning of a 20-year adventure for me.

02:07.830 --> 02:08.972
Right.

02:08.992 --> 02:10.534
Most of it enjoyable.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.997
All of it a learning exercise.

02:13.257 --> 02:13.698
Exactly.

02:14.619 --> 02:21.248
I grew up in Benchley, as you indicated, on a family farm there.

02:21.368 --> 02:24.552
Went to high school, graduated from Blackshire High School.

02:25.696 --> 02:37.594
In Germany, going to Germany, what you realize is that the emphasis in high school was placed on European history.

02:38.195 --> 02:47.149
So you know about the power of London and the nightlife of Paris and the artistry and so forth.

02:48.311 --> 02:53.779
So you're anxious to see these things that you have studied and read about.

02:54.788 --> 02:59.095
And that made it an exciting thing, first of all.

03:00.157 --> 03:02.480
You get to live the experience you've been studying.

03:03.121 --> 03:05.565
But it was a great time to be there for several reasons.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.550
Number one was kind of economic, I think.

03:09.071 --> 03:15.321
The ratio of marks per dollar was somewhere around 12 to 15 at that time.

03:15.341 --> 03:21.411
So you could buy much more goods and services with your money.

03:21.431 --> 03:22.332
But...

03:22.531 --> 03:29.300
It was fairly close to World War II within the decade of the end of World War II.

03:31.162 --> 03:35.948
And it was amazing to see the devastation that is caused by war.

03:37.010 --> 03:44.500
And the German cities, manufacturing facilities were all like totally destroyed.

03:44.620 --> 03:50.968
And it was my first time of seeing the female population of any country

03:51.556 --> 03:55.181
physically work doing a man's work.

03:55.261 --> 04:00.709
Rebuilding of the streets and infrastructure was did 80% of it by female.

04:01.590 --> 04:10.663
The building of the streets, as an example, the old streets primarily were of cobblestone, like six by six square.

04:11.504 --> 04:20.356
And they have women out there manhandling these cobblestone and laying them in place and physically doing the work.

04:20.376 --> 04:21.478
It was amazing.

04:22.353 --> 04:24.997
There were other advantages.

04:25.017 --> 04:30.445
As you know, we have just negotiated a status of force agreement with the Iraqis.

04:31.506 --> 04:33.429
We hadn't reached that point yet in Germany.

04:33.449 --> 04:37.776
At that time, the Germans were not allowed to be armed.

04:38.356 --> 04:39.678
They couldn't handle weapons.

04:40.179 --> 04:41.361
They couldn't arrest you.

04:41.922 --> 04:47.049
You were held accountable for your actions, but not by the German courts, by the military.

04:47.850 --> 04:48.411
So...

04:48.830 --> 04:51.373
It was kind of nice being there at that time.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.636
And indeed, you were an occupational force in Germany.

04:53.676 --> 04:55.198
We were an occupation army.

04:55.398 --> 04:55.919
That was your job.

04:55.959 --> 05:00.665
And you personally, you were heavy weapons infantry, mortar platoon.

05:00.866 --> 05:03.349
Mortar platoon, mortars.

05:03.369 --> 05:13.622
I started out on the 81 mortars initially and graduated to the four deuces, which is the biggest mortar that the army had.

05:14.176 --> 05:22.026
which is equivalent to 105 millimeter howitzer in diameter and destruction just doesn't have quite the range.

05:22.141 --> 05:22.582
Right.

05:22.602 --> 05:25.126
And of course the 1st Infantry had been in Germany since 1941.

05:25.506 --> 05:28.611
They had been since the beginning of the U.S.

05:28.631 --> 05:29.433
involvement in the war.

05:29.573 --> 05:31.175
The 1st Division into Germany.

05:31.436 --> 05:32.197
Right.

05:32.217 --> 05:37.005
And the storied history you wouldn't believe.

05:37.746 --> 05:48.183
Just listening, if you're exposed to the history of the 1st Infantry Division, you become a supporter of them.

05:48.203 --> 05:48.503
Right.

05:48.955 --> 05:55.247
They have the largest graveyards in France, as an example.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.592
They like to be first in everything.

05:57.612 --> 06:00.577
And they were first in death, combat death.

06:01.159 --> 06:07.751
The first across the Rhine River Infantry Division, the first to reach the Siegfried Line, the first to do all of these things.

06:09.755 --> 06:10.677
When I got there,

06:11.450 --> 06:23.033
The mission is impressed upon you in such a fashion that you don't forget it because the mission of the 1st Infantry Division at that time was to hold a line for one hour.

06:23.574 --> 06:27.342
That hour was to allow evacuation of civilians.

06:27.783 --> 06:32.833
After that, you were to make your way on your own back south of the Rhine River.

06:34.163 --> 06:39.419
You left Germany, went back to the States, Fort Riley.

06:41.144 --> 06:43.250
Your enlistment was up in 1956.

06:43.330 --> 06:47.262
You got out, you re-enlisted, first armor, Fort Polk, Louisiana.

06:47.562 --> 06:56.715
But I want to talk about your next really significant deployment, and that was to Alaska, where you went to Fort Greeley as part of the Continental Army Command.

06:57.156 --> 06:58.418
Talk about what your duties were there.

06:58.458 --> 07:01.522
You tested everything for cold weather, right?

07:01.542 --> 07:01.762
Yes.

07:02.243 --> 07:03.785
I was with the Arctic Test Board.

07:04.607 --> 07:08.232
We came on the CONOC Command, which is Continental Army Command.

07:08.252 --> 07:15.462
So that puts you up there on a fairly short list, a chain of command between you and the Chief of Staff of the Army.

07:15.843 --> 07:15.983
Mm-hmm.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.986
Headquarters was in, I believe, in Fort Monroe, Virginia at that time.

07:22.749 --> 07:28.437
But my job specifically was the mortar test NCO.

07:28.457 --> 07:39.414
I was in the mortar and test, mortar and chemical test section, and we tested all of the weapons for the mortars and the chemical weapons.

07:40.476 --> 07:45.463
We did the cold weather test work on, as an example,

07:45.950 --> 07:51.035
The present-day gas mask, I think they still use the one with the two cheeks.

07:52.497 --> 07:58.703
Prior to that, it had been the old mask with one canister on the left cheek.

08:00.044 --> 08:12.377
We tested the munition for the four-deuce mortar and the 81 mortar to give them increased range and more lethality.

08:14.179 --> 08:15.400
We also...

08:16.173 --> 08:18.735
We tested other equipment.

08:18.755 --> 08:22.899
We helped because you have to have X number of people doing things.

08:23.519 --> 08:28.784
We did work in conjunction with the quartermaster section on over white boots.

08:28.804 --> 08:30.806
That's what we call them.

08:31.786 --> 08:35.370
You didn't even put them on if it was above 20 below zero.

08:36.631 --> 08:37.932
And they would keep your feet warm.

08:38.792 --> 08:45.218
We did an over black boot that you wore if it was 20% higher.

08:46.008 --> 08:47.250
That was exciting work.

08:47.851 --> 08:55.822
And finally, we did the work on the special weapon, the battalion commander's atomic weapon.

08:56.303 --> 09:02.552
The infantry battalion commander had accessibility to an atomic weapon.

09:02.572 --> 09:05.176
It was called a David Crockett.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.279
But we didn't test the warhead.

09:08.481 --> 09:13.568
We only test the delivery system and haul around a warhead for

09:14.577 --> 09:18.582
Just for cold weather treatment, we didn't physically test the weapons.

09:18.602 --> 09:19.243
Right.

09:19.263 --> 09:22.027
Spent three years in Alaska, so you went through a... Yes, you were going to add.

09:22.047 --> 09:26.613
There was one other significant incident that went on in Alaska while I was there.

09:28.356 --> 09:32.862
The Russians got to playing around and sent up their Sputnik, which I failed to mention to you the other day.

09:33.502 --> 09:35.705
Now, that got us all going in high gear.

09:35.725 --> 09:37.648
I'm old enough to remember that, as a matter of fact.

09:37.688 --> 09:44.297
They put that Sputnik in orbit, and that put us on an alert, because a part of our alert procedures were...

09:44.750 --> 09:51.228
When we have an alert, if anything happens, the test system kind of ceased to exist.

09:51.669 --> 09:55.499
It became a second priority because our first mission was to man the due line.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.312
The defense early warning system.

10:00.764 --> 10:02.786
You were out there looking.

10:02.807 --> 10:04.609
You were taking a close look at that bird going across.

10:04.629 --> 10:04.929
That's right.

10:05.710 --> 10:09.274
In Alaska for three years, so you spent a lot of summers and winters in Alaska.

10:09.395 --> 10:10.997
So you got the full force of it all, right?

10:11.037 --> 10:12.078
Got the full force of it.

10:12.458 --> 10:13.159
Need to move on.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.641
You came back.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.983
You were at Fort Benning, U.S.

10:16.003 --> 10:20.288
Army Instructor Training School from the summers of 62 to 65.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.292
And then back to Germany again.

10:23.392 --> 10:28.358
Quickly, what was your job the next time when you went back to Germany for one year?

10:29.232 --> 10:40.246
I went back as a mortar David Crockett platoon sergeant controlling the same weapons that I had been teaching in Benin and doing test work on in Alaska.

10:41.147 --> 10:44.392
There was one significant incident that occurred while I was at Benin.

10:45.373 --> 10:46.715
We lost John F. Kennedy.

10:47.135 --> 10:53.924
That got our heart pumping because everybody prepared to stage an invasion from mainland U.S.

10:54.024 --> 10:55.526
along the Gulf Coast.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.530
But we went back to Germany.

10:58.898 --> 11:19.894
This time we went down in the folder gap the historic invasion route of everybody into Germany. That's where we spent time for a year until. As you said eyeball to eyeball with the Russians. With the Russians. They always seem to be there. They always seem to be there um

11:20.397 --> 11:34.274
And then back to the United States, Fort Bragg Military Assistance Advisory School for 12 weeks, where the emphasis you said you knew where you were headed because the emphasis there was on physical conditioning and learning the Vietnamese language.

11:34.914 --> 11:36.897
That's correct.

11:36.917 --> 11:41.102
You knew that when you got your orders probably five months early or six months early.

11:41.683 --> 11:47.029
They said, Vietnam, this is just a stop in transit to prepare you for that mission.

11:47.937 --> 11:50.481
And we did the 12 weeks there.

11:51.302 --> 11:54.887
And once again, the emphasis was on language and physical condition.

11:55.228 --> 11:59.494
And you found that you pretty well needed them both.

11:59.514 --> 12:05.302
10th Armored Vietnam, August of 1966 was the first time that you arrived in country.

12:05.403 --> 12:07.706
Things were really heating up about then.

12:07.786 --> 12:08.427
Talk about

12:09.048 --> 12:19.799
your unit, what your duty was in Vietnam, and go ahead and lead us on to the incidents whereby you received your first Purple Heart.

12:19.819 --> 12:21.403
I was assigned to the...

12:22.514 --> 12:23.836
It's a funny thing.

12:23.896 --> 12:27.440
I was assigned to what at the time was the 10th ARVN Division.

12:28.141 --> 12:29.963
And in the Vietnamese lingo.

12:30.144 --> 12:30.804
Right.

12:30.824 --> 12:31.485
I said armored.

12:31.505 --> 12:32.146
I meant armored.

12:32.166 --> 12:32.587
No, no.

12:32.607 --> 12:32.807
Right.

12:33.127 --> 12:33.588
Yes.

12:33.608 --> 12:33.808
Right.

12:33.848 --> 12:38.154
But in the Vietnamese lingo, the number 10 is a low number.

12:38.254 --> 12:40.536
Number one is the best with 10 being the worst.

12:41.257 --> 12:46.164
In the 10th ARVN Division, Infantry Division, they changed the name to the 18th.

12:46.664 --> 12:46.824
I see.

12:46.844 --> 12:48.246
For that reason only.

12:48.266 --> 12:48.466
I got you.

12:48.486 --> 12:50.108
So, you know, it didn't get discredited.

12:50.789 --> 12:50.970
Right.

12:50.990 --> 12:51.390
It didn't

12:51.590 --> 12:53.232
give you the wrong connotation.

12:53.793 --> 13:05.971
But when I went in there initially, we were sitting in there at the base of Black Virgin Mountain, well, several miles away from it, and guarding this little village.

13:05.991 --> 13:18.930
And what strikes you initially when you go in country is that the population has been removed from the countryside into the city because the war has caused this here.

13:18.978 --> 13:23.903
Everything out there other than a village that you know is occupied is kind of a free fire zone.

13:24.684 --> 13:28.828
We were sitting down here guarding this little village probably of about 5,000 people.

13:31.410 --> 13:46.605
We ran patrols and whatnot out of that place until we had an incident up at another location because that location was down at the edge of the rubber plantation on Highway 1.

13:48.982 --> 13:59.514
We had up at Vosu, we had a part of the infantry division, a battalion of it got overran to make the story short.

14:00.154 --> 14:02.537
And we had to get out and go up there.

14:03.498 --> 14:12.608
Now, as an advisor with an infantry battalion, you live and eat and live and die with those people.

14:13.189 --> 14:16.052
That is your unit.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.807
So we had to walk 75K a week.

14:18.827 --> 14:24.294
It took us about three days, and we arrived up there and found that the unit had been totally decimated.

14:24.534 --> 14:31.464
Out of 1,000 people, there was only 11 of them left to survive.

14:33.306 --> 14:38.513
With the ARVNs, you had a four-man advisory team, two officers and two enlisted.

14:39.809 --> 14:55.984
Only one man was left out of that four-man team, and there was an enlisted person who had suffered a chest wound, destroyed part of his lung, and he had been injured for three days laying in what amounts to your sewage ditch there.

14:56.825 --> 14:59.087
But he survived.

14:59.107 --> 15:08.736
And, of course, we were greeted with messages in the village posted on the bulletin board by the NVA unit that overran them and killed them all.

15:09.256 --> 15:12.020
and said that fate awaited us.

15:12.641 --> 15:38.537
Fortunately, it didn't occur, but in the attempt to make it occur, we got a desert in who was the regimental XO of that attacking unit, and he gave us the information that they were going to attack in about three days, gave us the total order of battle, everything, so we were prepared for them and kind of

15:40.120 --> 15:40.963
took care of business.

15:41.785 --> 15:43.330
Made short work of it.

15:44.072 --> 15:51.756
And they posted notices on the village board that they would be back.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.742
We owed them a debt and blood and all that.

15:54.802 --> 16:00.270
You told me that they even produced a list with names on it, and your name was on the list.

16:00.410 --> 16:00.911
That's right.

16:00.971 --> 16:01.632
They had a list.

16:01.832 --> 16:13.990
All of the advisors, there was only three of us at that time, two officers and myself, and all three of our names were on there in various Pierce Awards for your head.

16:14.370 --> 16:14.631
Right.

16:16.353 --> 16:19.678
Their next attack wasn't quite as bold as the last one.

16:19.979 --> 16:26.388
Because on the first one, they just attacked in mass, which was kind of unusual for them.

16:26.408 --> 16:29.393
But on the next one, they sit back and mortared us.

16:29.713 --> 16:34.160
And that's where I received my Purple Heart first time was in a mortar attack.

16:34.420 --> 16:34.601
Right.

16:34.621 --> 16:36.203
This is about a month after the first attack.

16:36.523 --> 16:37.244
About a month.

16:37.325 --> 16:38.346
Yes.

16:38.486 --> 16:45.296
And see, at Vosu, that was a village and it was occupied.

16:45.336 --> 16:49.142
That's where they go to mark and post the propaganda list.

16:50.573 --> 16:57.821
Vodot was like 4,000 kilometers away, and it was unoccupied.

16:58.022 --> 16:59.483
We human beings living there.

16:59.503 --> 17:15.822
We lost the senior advisor, a captain from Massachusetts, and we lost the junior officer advisor with a severe leg wound, and they gave me a...

17:16.662 --> 17:19.026
a little present I guess I'll carry for the rest of my life.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.911
I still retain some of the fragments.

17:21.931 --> 17:23.033
You caught some shrapnel, right?

17:23.053 --> 17:24.175
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

17:24.997 --> 17:28.603
In my arm, in my hand, and in the right side of my body.

17:29.004 --> 17:29.645
Right.

17:29.665 --> 17:31.728
They removed all that on the right side of my body.

17:31.788 --> 17:35.335
That I still carry is really in the palm of my hand.

17:35.355 --> 17:41.826
In America, having the best doctors, he says, I can take it out, but you will...

17:42.177 --> 17:43.458
I'll do more damage to the hand.

17:43.879 --> 17:45.761
Leave it in there and you'll suffer no effects for it.

17:46.262 --> 17:48.184
And that was in 1967.

17:50.006 --> 17:52.428
And I haven't had a day's pain with it yet.

17:53.269 --> 18:01.398
Periodically, about once every two or three years, the VA will x-ray it to see if it's moving because it's located right under those two veins right there.

18:01.418 --> 18:03.300
And it's just kind of steady.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.284
1967, you were 35 years old.

18:06.945 --> 18:07.645
That would be right.

18:08.346 --> 18:09.067
October.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.108
Still a young man.

18:10.325 --> 18:11.887
Yes, yes, yes.

18:11.907 --> 18:21.540
Were you, and we didn't talk about this the other day, but being in that situation, being in the firefight, what were your thoughts?

18:21.760 --> 18:26.307
World War II veterans tell me all the time their thoughts were just do your job, do your job and survive.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.368
Is that what your thoughts were?

18:27.488 --> 18:29.030
Were you scared?

18:29.050 --> 18:32.775
No, you don't have time to get scared.

18:32.795 --> 18:35.359
And that's basically what happens.

18:36.300 --> 18:40.045
Your training kicks in and you take it from there.

18:40.430 --> 18:43.514
And like you say, I was 35 years old.

18:44.436 --> 18:50.044
The draft at that time was from 19 to 26, I believe.

18:51.426 --> 18:58.396
And the difference is I have spent 10, 12 years in preparation for this moment.

18:59.478 --> 19:04.665
So you just automatically, you believe so much in your training

19:05.523 --> 19:12.453
And if you didn't want to be there, you wouldn't, of course, you had ample opportunities to get out.

19:12.473 --> 19:19.023
So you just kind of go on automatic pilot, like the pilot that landed that plane in the Hudson River the other day.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.265
He didn't do a lot of thinking.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.889
He just kind of automatically do your job.

19:23.951 --> 19:28.898
And you will find that at times, you will actually...

19:29.367 --> 19:36.496
In the middle of a fight, you'll sometimes think, now what the hell am I doing here and why am I not afraid?

19:37.658 --> 19:39.820
Because your training takes over.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.023
You don't do stupid things.

19:42.904 --> 19:50.034
You don't run standing straight up if they're shooting at you, but you really don't get time to be afraid.

19:50.054 --> 19:58.885
Now, when it's all over 30 minutes later and you're sitting down smoking your first cigarette, you might not be able to stand back up.

19:59.624 --> 20:03.411
It's a great analogy about the pilot landing in the Hudson.

20:04.693 --> 20:13.369
Let's look at some pictures here real quick of some of the things that you've talked about and some pictures of the young soldier, Jeffrey Bailey.

20:14.652 --> 20:15.473
When was that taken?

20:16.280 --> 20:21.530
That would have been in early 1967, I believe.

20:21.711 --> 20:24.296
Okay, so that would have been after your first tour.

20:24.997 --> 20:26.199
It was in between tours.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.642
Yeah, before your second tour.

20:27.682 --> 20:33.694
It was even before... Before Chicago.

20:33.714 --> 20:34.415
Before Chicago.

20:34.535 --> 20:36.860
Right, which we'll be talking about next show.

20:37.702 --> 20:38.423
Okay, let's move on.

20:40.411 --> 20:41.793
That one is much earlier.

20:41.833 --> 20:45.618
That's going to be in the late 50s.

20:45.958 --> 20:49.663
It came out of Alaska in 59, so it's going to be in 59 or 60.

20:50.284 --> 20:51.685
You had received expert marksman?

20:52.266 --> 20:52.667
That's right.

20:53.548 --> 20:57.433
Citations?

20:57.453 --> 20:58.053
Now talk about this.

20:58.073 --> 21:03.420
This was during a training exercise, and that's you in the buggy there.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.703
This was just sort of a training exercise, is that right?

21:05.723 --> 21:06.524
That's a training day.

21:06.624 --> 21:08.747
That's an organizational day.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.734
It's like the birthday of the organizations.

21:11.967 --> 21:19.857
really a training day where everybody takes off because after this, there's the beer and the food.

21:19.877 --> 21:22.120
And that's in Fort Hood, Texas.

21:22.140 --> 21:23.722
And that's a first sergeant's race.

21:23.742 --> 21:28.228
See, all of the first sergeants are being pulled by three people from their unit.

21:28.348 --> 21:28.628
Okay.

21:28.648 --> 21:29.509
So this wasn't training.

21:29.529 --> 21:31.512
This was field day, huh?

21:31.632 --> 21:33.354
This is an athletic event day.

21:33.374 --> 21:33.715
I see.

21:33.855 --> 21:34.195
Okay.

21:34.475 --> 21:35.717
And we won the race, by the way.

21:36.037 --> 21:36.758
Okay.

21:36.778 --> 21:39.662
And you were serious about it because this next one shows that you're...

21:39.997 --> 22:05.616
you're back there like you're riding a bucking bronco and there you got your horses there in front of you. And they were good. Yeah. That particular day we don't have any pictures of it but we had the staff, the battalion staff, battalion commander xo, and one two three four, the staff officer pulling against the first sergeant. Right. And selected platoon sergeant on a rope pull while you drag the other through the mud pit.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.214
We drove those officers right through the mud.

22:08.274 --> 22:12.588
Oh, my goodness.

22:13.731 --> 22:13.952
Let's go.

22:14.012 --> 22:15.216
We got one more picture.

22:15.236 --> 22:18.627
You had talked about the Black Virgin Mountain.

22:18.809 --> 22:21.313
knew it by then, the Black Virgin Mountain.

22:21.333 --> 22:25.018
I found this picture on the internet of the Black Virgin Mountain.

22:25.059 --> 22:26.220
Talk about what we're looking at there.

22:26.801 --> 22:30.867
Well, it speaks for itself, except for one thing.

22:30.887 --> 22:34.473
The very top of it was secured by the Army Security Agency.

22:34.833 --> 22:41.403
And this is always one of our secret intelligence gathering people.

22:41.423 --> 22:47.112
They listen to all of the enemy traffic and electronic eavesdropping outfits.

22:47.227 --> 22:48.809
mostly, so far as I know.

22:49.810 --> 22:53.034
But they occupied the top of the mountain with their security.

22:53.534 --> 23:00.602
The middle part of the mountain was occupied by the enemy forces, and the bottom part was occupied by American forces.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.866
So what are we looking at there at the base of the mountain right there in front?

23:04.046 --> 23:05.869
That's a base camp.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.230
I'm not sure who it is.

23:07.510 --> 23:12.116
Like I say, we were like maybe 15, 20 miles away from it.

23:12.316 --> 23:13.217
Right, right.

23:13.653 --> 23:20.062
But on top of that mountain, you could see for a long way because you're talking about a mountain just raising up in the middle of the flat land.

23:20.082 --> 23:21.224
That's exactly right.

23:21.344 --> 23:27.593
Because actually, see, you're getting down toward the delta, toward the flat rice growing country down in there.

23:27.613 --> 23:33.822
And if there's a military advantage in holding the high ground, they've got it.

23:34.612 --> 23:35.894
They have got it.

23:36.274 --> 23:36.675
Indeed.

23:37.235 --> 23:45.225
You said that sort of a unique part of your service was that you served in every active armored division in your 20 years of service.

23:45.605 --> 23:46.386
Talk about that.

23:46.707 --> 23:48.048
Every active armored division.

23:48.088 --> 23:52.774
First armored division, Old Ironside.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.918
The second armored division, Hell on Wheels.

23:55.978 --> 23:58.341
The third armored division, Spearhead Division.

23:59.401 --> 24:05.951
And I don't know what the 4th Army Division's motto was.

24:06.251 --> 24:07.233
I simply don't know.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.636
I don't know if they had one.

24:10.297 --> 24:13.562
But I served all four of them.

24:13.582 --> 24:19.111
And then I never got hired in one in a numerical order in any other division.

24:19.131 --> 24:21.274
1st Infantry Division, 1st Care Division.

24:21.878 --> 24:25.021
4th Army Division and 3 preceding.

24:25.962 --> 24:32.387
But, and every one of those Army Division, like I said, has a slogan.

24:32.407 --> 24:36.971
The first arm at Old Ironside was Patton's nickname.

24:38.192 --> 24:42.175
The Hell on Wheels thing was another one of his gimmicks.

24:42.196 --> 24:50.923
Spearhead Division was Eisenhower's thing because he liked to spearhead his attacks with the armor of the Spearhead Division.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.148
of the 3rd Armored Division.

24:54.408 --> 24:56.091
Exactly.

24:56.451 --> 25:03.763
When you left Vietnam after your first tour, did you have a feeling that you would be back?

25:05.285 --> 25:14.459
I really didn't at that time, not that I recall, because we were talking about getting out of there in 1967.

25:15.221 --> 25:15.561
Right.

25:16.283 --> 25:20.689
And we had been in there for a number of years then, back 64, 65.

25:21.170 --> 25:26.898
But I figured that there was always that chance.

25:26.918 --> 25:29.782
And I wasn't about to volunteer to go back.

25:30.683 --> 25:35.269
My wife will not believe that I didn't volunteer to go to Vietnam the first time.

25:35.390 --> 25:39.315
Well, I did, but they refused that and sent me to Germany.

25:39.335 --> 25:41.238
I didn't volunteer the second time.

25:41.258 --> 25:43.941
They just said, he wanted to go then, we'll send him now.

25:44.963 --> 25:45.784
You're...

25:46.372 --> 25:50.637
You and your wife have been married for some 53 years now.

25:50.657 --> 25:51.177
53 years.

25:52.319 --> 25:53.540
She's been along for the ride.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.561
She's been along for it.

25:54.741 --> 26:03.551
And a military wife, especially one that sees her husband go off to Vietnam twice, takes a special person.

26:04.212 --> 26:04.713
It does.

26:05.013 --> 26:09.478
And you have to have a lot of respect for these people.

26:10.599 --> 26:14.944
And they demand it and they get it because, first of all, if you're out of their life,

26:15.143 --> 26:20.344
as the primary breadwinner or the controlling force, you're the head of the family.

26:20.746 --> 26:27.352
for a year and they get along just fine without your supervision, authority or cooperation.

26:28.394 --> 26:30.856
You have to kind of do some adjustments when you get back.

26:31.136 --> 26:31.396
Right.

26:32.217 --> 26:36.481
Next week we're going to talk about two other aspects of your service.

26:36.502 --> 26:47.192
Your service as we mentioned in the streets of Southside Chicago and we're going to talk about your second tour of Vietnam and what you've been doing since 1973 when you retired from the military.

26:47.172 --> 26:52.299
But you came back after your first tour of Vietnam and then back to Fort Hood, is that right?

26:52.319 --> 26:53.161
Back to Fort Hood.

26:54.262 --> 27:03.015
I came back to Fort Hood once again, joined the 1st Army Division, an old unit I'd been in before.

27:03.035 --> 27:10.986
Out of four trips to Fort Hood and one in Louisiana with the 1st Army Division,

27:11.810 --> 27:17.739
I only served in two units, one with the 634th Armored Infantry Battalion.

27:17.999 --> 27:21.244
All the rest of them was with this one infantry battalion.

27:24.008 --> 27:26.271
Once or twice the same company.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.675
So it was like my home away from home.

27:28.695 --> 27:30.938
You told me you had five tours with the 1st Armored Division.

27:30.978 --> 27:31.459
That's right.

27:31.699 --> 27:32.080
That's right.

27:32.120 --> 27:32.881
Four of them at Hood.

27:33.282 --> 27:34.283
You got to know them well.

27:34.503 --> 27:36.366
Got to know them.

27:36.987 --> 27:45.540
I know Fort Hood as well as particularly the hills and hollers, the creeks and streams, the training areas.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.403
There's not a lot you don't know, I have a feeling.

27:47.423 --> 27:48.865
We're going to learn more of it next week.

27:49.266 --> 27:49.506
Thanks.

27:49.526 --> 27:50.808
We'll be back next week with you.

27:50.868 --> 27:51.449
Thank you.

27:51.509 --> 28:05.070
We have taken First Sergeant Bailey's military career now to Germany, Alaska, Korea, and the first tour of Vietnam, still to cover his some six years, including the streets of Chicago, and back to Vietnam where he earned the Silver Star.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.475
So join us next week for the rest of this remarkable story of service.

28:09.036 --> 28:10.037
I'm Tom Turbeville.

28:10.097 --> 28:25.872
Join First Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey and me next week on Veterans of the Valley.

28:30.155 --> 28:40.398
[Music.]

28:40.398 --> 28:50.000
[Music.]

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
[Music.]

28:55.000 --> 29:05.000
[Silence.]

29:05.000 --> 29:15.000
[Silence.]
