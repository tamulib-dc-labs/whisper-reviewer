00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
[Music.]

00:58.448 --> 01:00.790
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.252
I'm Tom Turbiville.

01:03.160 --> 01:12.695
Imagine having fought World War II without the B-25 bomber, or in the case of the plane that Dan Chadbourne served in, the PBJ B-25 Mitchell.

01:13.196 --> 01:22.030
It was loud, it was crowded, but it was a warrior of an aircraft that gained much of its fame as the transport for Jimmy Doolittle's 1942 raid on Tokyo.

01:22.432 --> 01:37.048
Marine Dan Chadbourne O'Brien didn't get his first wish, that was to be a tail gunner on an SVT Dauntless, but rather became a radio gunner on the B-25, flying 38 missions in the Pacific Theater from February to September of 1945.

01:37.400 --> 01:47.153
His 443rd Marine Bombing Squadron would strafe and bomb and even serve as an escort for the fighters of the 1st Marine Wing to the invasion of Okinawa.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.195
That's Operation Iceberg.

01:49.215 --> 01:52.400
His is a fascinating story of service in World War II.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.664
Please welcome Marine Flyer Dan Chadbourne.

01:55.684 --> 01:56.305
Dan, welcome.

01:56.365 --> 01:58.007
It's great to have you here on the show.

01:58.409 --> 02:06.740
You nearly had to go into the Navy or the Army, but you had some corrective surgery so that you could get your wish of going into the Marines.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.581
Talk about that.

02:08.802 --> 02:14.369
I probably would have gone in in the end of December of 42.

02:16.192 --> 02:23.421
And at that time, the options were open to be able to go into the Marine Corps, but after

02:24.059 --> 02:26.803
making some preliminary inquiries there.

02:26.863 --> 02:30.969
They told me I would have to have that selective surgery done first.

02:31.209 --> 02:32.491
Right.

02:32.511 --> 02:36.737
So that delayed me into the spring of, uh, 43 of getting in there.

02:37.017 --> 02:37.759
Right.

02:37.779 --> 02:46.691
But, uh, I, I finally had to go down and be drafted in order to be, because they'd closed the enlistments with the Marines at that time.

02:46.892 --> 02:47.152
Right.

02:47.673 --> 02:49.015
And I had to be drafted.

02:49.035 --> 02:52.159
So when I did and they got me up there to,

02:53.050 --> 03:00.782
to put me in the service, they gave me an option of going into Marines or into the, not into the Marines, into the Navy or the Army.

03:01.122 --> 03:01.783
Right.

03:01.804 --> 03:08.193
And I kept telling them, no, I was supposed to go into the Marine Corps and explained that they had closed the enlistments.

03:09.175 --> 03:10.016
Well, we can't do it.

03:10.076 --> 03:12.460
So I produced a letter from the doctor.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.042
They did the corrective surgery.

03:14.824 --> 03:14.944
Right.

03:14.964 --> 03:18.990
And some old salty Marine sergeant and some others went off in a corner

03:19.612 --> 03:23.816
and talked a few minutes and came back and said, OK, we're going to put you in the Marine Corps.

03:23.856 --> 03:29.862
So in spite of having to go into the Army or the Navy, I ended up in the Marine Corps.

03:29.882 --> 03:30.503
Wish granted.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.003
That's great.

03:31.824 --> 03:35.087
What was your fascination with the SBD Dauntless?

03:35.228 --> 03:36.629
You wanted to be a tail gunner there.

03:36.789 --> 03:39.692
Well, it just looked like an exciting thing to do.

03:39.792 --> 03:48.741
And if you look at any of the old films of the SBDs bombing on the Japanese, it was

03:49.210 --> 03:56.261
pretty tough because you're coming straight down and you had air brakes to keep you from going into the ship.

03:58.624 --> 04:16.272
And it was pretty bad because after we started flying in a B-25, then you were doing more horizontal flying and you were trying to come straight down on a smokestack in one of those SBDs.

04:16.292 --> 04:17.173
Right, right.

04:17.193 --> 04:18.475
You ended up...

04:19.214 --> 04:26.885
working radio and a gunner, and the 443rd Marine that you joined up in Cherry Point, North Carolina.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.949
So sort of take us there and then on into the service.

04:30.009 --> 04:41.705
Well, I actually started out in another air group prior to that, which was 416, and we did most of the training at Cherry Point and then down in Boca Chica, Florida.

04:41.725 --> 04:46.892
And when we got near the end of that training, well, they took parts of our group

04:47.598 --> 04:50.923
and shipped us overseas as replacement in this 443.

04:52.545 --> 04:58.615
And we had a brand new airplane with all the new features on it.

04:58.635 --> 05:05.345
And we got out on the west coast and they put a belly tank in that bomber so it could make it to Hawaii.

05:07.127 --> 05:09.651
And we had to take all the armament off the plane.

05:09.711 --> 05:11.614
So we took it off and crated it.

05:12.488 --> 05:17.714
And two of us ended up having to escort the crates of stuff out to the island.

05:17.734 --> 05:23.080
So we flipped a coin and another guy and myself ended up going on ship.

05:24.761 --> 05:28.746
Well, the rest of them flew up to Seattle and finally made it there.

05:28.766 --> 05:35.473
But by the time they got to the islands out where we were, we were already assigned and in business.

05:36.334 --> 05:39.137
So they came flying in there about two months later.

05:39.944 --> 05:41.627
And we said, where have you been?

05:41.687 --> 05:49.520
Well, they wined and dined up in California, but we were already getting points on the ground out there where we were.

05:50.201 --> 05:54.588
There was a point in your training, I believe, that you jumped, right?

05:55.089 --> 05:55.369
Yeah.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.731
Yeah, a free fall parachute jump.

05:56.751 --> 06:03.022
Yeah, that was in training because they sent us down to Camp Lejeune where they trained the paratroopers.

06:03.122 --> 06:03.342
Right.

06:03.943 --> 06:05.766
And they made you do the free fall.

06:06.087 --> 06:06.407
Right.

06:06.472 --> 06:13.042
And first, it made you do all the jumping off platforms and landing correctly where you didn't break your neck.

06:14.365 --> 06:17.770
But it was required that you had to make one free fall.

06:19.132 --> 06:20.755
And it was interesting.

06:20.875 --> 06:21.897
Yeah, I bet it was.

06:22.297 --> 06:25.863
You didn't need that training in your service as it turned out later on.

06:25.903 --> 06:27.325
No, unfortunately, we didn't need you.

06:27.365 --> 06:27.826
That was good.

06:28.006 --> 06:33.475
You were sent to the South Pacific in 1944 as a waste gunner.

06:33.826 --> 06:40.794
Talk about the bombing missions and sort of the nature of your bombing missions and what you did.

06:40.834 --> 06:50.946
Well, we were in what was called the Solomon Islands, and I was on a little island called Emeru, which was the 150th meridian, about three degrees below the equator.

06:52.027 --> 06:55.711
And we bombed basically New Britain and New Ireland.

06:57.393 --> 07:01.538
And Ribaul Harbor was a staunch,

07:02.092 --> 07:04.234
of naval base for the Japanese.

07:05.756 --> 07:12.484
And Kaviyang was another out at the end of the island of New Island.

07:13.525 --> 07:16.088
It was the easiest for us to get to.

07:16.108 --> 07:28.943
So if we went on a bombing run that was designed to drop bombs at Rebaal and got down and the weather was bad and you couldn't see to drop the bombs,

07:29.480 --> 07:36.651
Well, they were always a secondary target on the way home, so you'd drop everything on them before you'd drop it into the ocean.

07:36.832 --> 07:37.312
I see.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.897
So you had a primary target and a secondary target.

07:39.957 --> 07:44.003
Primary and secondary targets, and you always had those any time you flew.

07:45.265 --> 07:52.296
And you had to understand that there was no such things as radar in those days, weather radars or anything else.

07:53.518 --> 07:57.124
And I think I was telling you that we went

07:57.965 --> 08:13.602
One air flight, what happened in the morning before you were ready to go on a bombing mission, they would send one airplane down with all the meteorologists to the area where you were going to go.

08:13.622 --> 08:16.946
And he would read the weather and encode it.

08:17.327 --> 08:26.757
And as a radio operator, you got to send it on what was called a Fox schedule, where it was sent out on the air twice with no response.

08:27.412 --> 08:43.032
so that the people on the ground that were getting ready to come bomb, not just our island, but there were some other islands that had planes that put over the same target, would monitor it, and they would interpolate whether they would be ready to fly.

08:43.773 --> 08:49.881
If it was good weather, you'd pass the group going to the bombing thing, and you'd be coming home.

08:49.901 --> 08:51.323
You didn't do any bombing that time.

08:51.343 --> 08:55.208
You just went down and surveyed the weather.

08:55.745 --> 09:18.883
came back but that didn't count as a bomb and run in the deal but it was interesting because it was one of the few times that a radio operator really got to do anything over distance because you were transmitting over several hundred miles in all directions and they were monitoring it and they took your data that you sent

09:19.387 --> 09:22.771
decoded it and used it to be able to go back and forth.

09:23.572 --> 09:24.933
But they did that every day.

09:25.474 --> 09:30.019
I didn't do them on a daily basis, but I did get to do that a few times.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.362
The nature of your missions I know varied.

09:32.382 --> 09:35.285
The plane would normally fly at a maximum of what, 10,000 to 12,000 feet?

09:35.405 --> 09:41.252
Most of our medium bombing was from about 10,000 to 12,000 feet.

09:41.272 --> 09:42.753
And there was a reason for that.

09:42.834 --> 09:48.600
A PBJ didn't have much ceiling, much beyond that going up.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.224
You could go up to maybe 15 or 17.

09:51.284 --> 09:52.205
You couldn't stay there.

09:52.506 --> 09:56.171
You had to fly at an effective rate.

09:56.372 --> 10:00.298
They were done from about 10,000 to 12,000 feet.

10:00.618 --> 10:00.919
I see.

10:01.199 --> 10:09.151
And then part of the time when we did low-level bombing, it came in off the water and you raised up long enough to get over the trees.

10:10.313 --> 10:17.524
And you would drop anti-personnel bombs that had a delayed fuse so that

10:17.909 --> 10:23.218
When it bounced off the ground and came back up under the plane, it looked like you were going to get blown off, but it didn't.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.108
It had an 11-second fuse that gave you a chance to get further away from the bomb.

10:29.208 --> 10:29.489
Right.

10:29.589 --> 10:33.656
And these were in your strafing exercises, your strafing missions, right?

10:33.676 --> 10:33.796
Yeah.

10:33.816 --> 10:42.972
When you were strafing bivouac areas or you were doing roads where they would have vehicles on the highway,

10:43.863 --> 10:46.406
And you were only about 100 feet off the ground here at this time.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.407
You barely cleaned the top of the tree.

10:48.468 --> 10:49.188
Right, right.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.209
So not even that far.

10:50.289 --> 10:51.330
You weren't doing very far.

10:51.591 --> 10:53.613
Not very high at all.

10:54.914 --> 10:57.576
Talk about the time that your engine got knocked out.

10:57.617 --> 10:58.237
There was fuel.

10:58.317 --> 11:03.682
Well, we were doing a medium bomb in that time.

11:03.703 --> 11:07.646
And we were just coming off the target and got one engine hit.

11:09.048 --> 11:12.351
And gasoline started pouring into the back of the plane.

11:13.462 --> 11:16.406
We called up front and said, hey, are we ready to leave?

11:16.746 --> 11:24.356
And he said, no, if we haven't blown up yet, just turn all the electrical gear off, and we'll drop out and fly home on one engine.

11:24.456 --> 11:26.178
So that was basically what we did.

11:27.339 --> 11:35.149
And in doing so, they assigned one of the other planes to fly wing with you to get back to the base area.

11:35.399 --> 11:41.225
And we landed with all the meat wagons out there waiting on you and no problem.

11:41.345 --> 11:43.047
We didn't have any problem.

11:43.107 --> 11:44.809
It landed okay with one engine.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.230
You turned out to be a heck of a pilot.

11:46.250 --> 11:46.531
Yeah.

11:47.992 --> 11:55.700
Talk about the mission that I referred to in the opening where you helped move the first Marine Air Wing into Okinawa for the invasion.

11:55.980 --> 12:04.309
When the invasion of Okinawa began, the first Marine Air Wing was still down in the South Pacific.

12:04.981 --> 12:09.307
And they were a fighter outfit, F4Us.

12:10.569 --> 12:16.237
And they had no navigational facilities over long distances.

12:17.419 --> 12:23.087
So they assigned four planes to each bomber, two under each wing.

12:24.088 --> 12:34.223
And we took them through the end of New Guinea, up through Lady Gulf, and up to Clark Field in Luzon.

12:34.243 --> 12:34.363
Right.

12:34.698 --> 12:42.369
And we ferried the plane from there into Katrina Air Base, I guess it was, at Okinawa.

12:42.389 --> 12:43.490
Right.

12:43.510 --> 12:47.015
And they flew wing on us all the way back and forth, up there.

12:47.235 --> 12:48.717
We didn't bring them back.

12:48.737 --> 12:49.919
No.

12:50.039 --> 12:56.168
You described the scene at Okinawa as the... Well, when we landed... The boats in the water.

12:56.748 --> 12:56.829
Huh?

12:56.989 --> 12:58.190
Oh, the ships in the water.

12:58.251 --> 12:58.571
Yeah.

12:58.591 --> 13:01.515
Well, when we first got close enough to...

13:02.221 --> 13:32.160
where we were headed at Okinawa looking down while we could see the battle wagons all firing onto the shore up there shelling the lower end of that island and in distance as far as you could see in any direction were ships and there were battleships, navy ships, cargo ships, you name it and they were all separated so that the Japanese couldn't knock them all down at one time.

13:32.883 --> 13:42.474
And when we landed, well, there's two old Marines were pitching horseshoes there by the airstrip, and I said, you're not worried with all the sirens going off?

13:42.494 --> 13:43.055
He said, no.

13:43.115 --> 13:50.003
He said, they're trying to bomb these things out in the ocean out here, these ships.

13:50.043 --> 13:52.726
They're trying to sink the ships.

13:52.746 --> 14:00.375
So every ship out there had armament on it, and they were all firing at these kamikazes coming down into the

14:01.267 --> 14:05.251
try and make it to the ships, but most of them never ever hit anything but the water.

14:05.631 --> 14:07.333
Exactly, exactly.

14:07.353 --> 14:08.614
But it was kind of weird.

14:08.634 --> 14:09.335
Yeah.

14:09.355 --> 14:18.143
That must have been quite a sight, because at this time, as you said, you're talking about the kamikazes, this was, as you described it, sort of a desperate time in the war.

14:18.243 --> 14:18.563
It was.

14:18.663 --> 14:29.974
Well, they were already down, excuse me, to the end, and were having a hard time surviving with anything.

14:30.663 --> 14:40.057
If they hadn't have dropped the atomic bombs by, then the invasion would have come along after that in place of it.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.559
Right, right.

14:41.579 --> 14:42.380
Talk about the B-25.

14:42.621 --> 14:51.394
We're going to see some photos here in a little bit, but the B-25 and the PBJ, as you call it, and the aircraft itself, you talked about how loud it was.

14:51.434 --> 14:54.158
It was very crowded, but it was a dependable aircraft, wasn't it?

14:54.178 --> 14:55.019
It was very good.

14:55.059 --> 14:59.185
It had two right cyclone engines, and you had a straight stack, which meant that

14:59.958 --> 15:06.868
the power came straight out of that thing and it was the noisiest airplane you could ever fly in, I'm sure.

15:07.308 --> 15:07.589
Right.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.835
And your ears would ring after you got back on the ground.

15:12.916 --> 15:17.182
But it was a very versatile plane and very dependable.

15:17.382 --> 15:25.254
Well, that's the reason that Doolittle used it for the raids, obviously, to get off of the Hornet so fast as it did.

15:25.494 --> 15:25.594
Yeah.

15:27.397 --> 15:35.488
He did a good thing of getting that thing off an aircraft carrier because it took some distance to get one of those things up in the air.

15:36.069 --> 15:41.837
And I think I told you that the airstrip we worked off on was a plateau about 200 feet up in the air.

15:43.219 --> 15:48.747
And you could go offloaded and if you dipped a little bit going off the end, you still had enough airspeed to

15:49.081 --> 15:51.424
pick up without falling off in the water.

15:51.585 --> 15:52.946
Right, right.

15:52.966 --> 15:58.394
But same token, if you came in short on the other end of that air strip, you hit the side of the mountain.

15:58.414 --> 16:01.639
Hit the side of the mountain, right.

16:02.740 --> 16:06.746
But the B-25 was probably one of the few aircrafts that could do that, that could pull that off.

16:06.766 --> 16:16.339
Yeah, it was really, I think the Marines maybe had, well, in the Pacific, they only had about five or six squadrons.

16:16.359 --> 16:18.843
They didn't have a whole hell of a lot of them.

16:18.863 --> 16:19.003
Right.

16:19.692 --> 16:27.183
There were much more than that that were in training over the years, but that basically was what most of them were.

16:27.543 --> 16:27.944
Exactly.

16:28.224 --> 16:31.369
Let's go ahead and go to those photographs that we talked about right now.

16:31.389 --> 16:35.655
These are some pictures that Dan supplied us.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.878
There's a young cowboy.

16:38.259 --> 16:40.282
It must have been.

16:40.302 --> 16:42.285
You look like you're about, what, about four years old?

16:42.445 --> 16:42.926
I guess.

16:43.366 --> 16:44.468
I don't remember it.

16:44.684 --> 16:46.289
No, I wouldn't expect that you would.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.376
My wife dug that picture up somewhere.

16:48.497 --> 16:49.400
I just thought it was cute.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.684
We ought to use it.

16:51.868 --> 16:56.162
Well, in those days, they'd bring the horse around to the neighborhood and they'd

16:56.598 --> 17:01.025
photograph you sitting on the horse, and then they'd move on to where some other kids were.

17:01.045 --> 17:01.346
That's right.

17:01.366 --> 17:02.387
And they'd sell you the picture.

17:02.407 --> 17:03.108
Yeah, they'd sell you the picture.

17:03.128 --> 17:05.232
Well, I'll tell you what, they did that when my kids were young, too.

17:05.252 --> 17:07.335
So that's been a business for a long time.

17:07.395 --> 17:08.437
It's a good business.

17:08.457 --> 17:09.599
Okay, let's move on.

17:09.619 --> 17:11.021
What a great picture that I think this is.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.283
I don't know where that was made.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.326
Well, it was obviously, you were a young Marine.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.909
I was still in the service somewhere.

17:16.089 --> 17:16.950
Right, right.

17:17.171 --> 17:19.895
That's a sharp-looking Marine there.

17:20.236 --> 17:20.756
It really is.

17:20.957 --> 17:21.778
It's a good-looking picture.

17:23.378 --> 17:24.820
Now, this outfit.

17:24.840 --> 17:29.745
Okay, these were, I'm the second one from the right on the bottom down here.

17:30.606 --> 17:38.856
And these were replacements for the people that either got killed or were shipped back somewhere else.

17:38.896 --> 17:44.382
These were all airmen that were various amounts of things on there.

17:44.402 --> 17:48.587
We carried seven people on a B-25 on this PBJ.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.630
I never told you that, but that was how many

17:52.117 --> 17:52.598
That was the crew.

17:52.618 --> 17:53.659
People flew on it.

17:54.120 --> 17:54.360
Yeah.

17:54.380 --> 18:00.128
And when we up in Clark Field in Luzon, they were looking at a B-24.

18:00.509 --> 18:04.555
They were bombing Formosa in the middle of the night, night hecklers.

18:05.236 --> 18:09.802
And the Army guys kept saying, well, you don't have in that plane the stuff we've got in ours.

18:09.862 --> 18:14.229
So I said, they started naming off all the electronic gear they had.

18:14.249 --> 18:15.370
And I said, we got that.

18:15.530 --> 18:16.171
We got that.

18:16.191 --> 18:18.595
And he said, there's no way you could get all that in that airplane.

18:18.615 --> 18:18.715
Yeah.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.729
So they came and looked.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.413
They said, we got to go look at the airplane.

18:23.493 --> 18:27.918
So we had all the navigational gears that they had.

18:27.938 --> 18:36.288
By that time of the war, they had Loran gear, which was also a navigational material.

18:36.308 --> 18:38.250
Here, let's move on to the next photograph.

18:38.570 --> 18:42.135
That's yours and Eddie Rue's first car, right?

18:42.155 --> 18:43.957
Yeah, that was our first vehicle.

18:43.977 --> 18:48.482
And I think we spent...

18:48.850 --> 18:50.532
Maybe $300 on it.

18:50.772 --> 18:52.074
That's what it cost.

18:52.914 --> 18:53.715
But it was neat.

18:53.795 --> 18:56.959
I'd love to have it today because I think it'd be worth a fortune.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.422
And that was taken here, right?

18:59.442 --> 19:00.643
Yeah, that was in Bryan.

19:00.663 --> 19:02.725
You had to come back to school.

19:02.745 --> 19:03.967
Yeah, we were in school.

19:05.088 --> 19:05.348
Okay.

19:06.630 --> 19:07.951
Let's go back now.

19:08.031 --> 19:11.215
That was a platoon that I trained with.

19:11.295 --> 19:14.358
And I was the last man on the right on the bottom.

19:14.378 --> 19:16.140
That's you right there on the bottom right.

19:16.407 --> 19:22.954
And the short people, I tell you, when you were marching, were okay as long as you were walking in your direction.

19:22.974 --> 19:30.802
But when they turned around and started walking where those tall people were on the other end, you almost had to run to keep up with them.

19:30.822 --> 19:36.088
We've got some B-25 pictures here coming up from a book that you have.

19:36.108 --> 19:42.014
This one's a little bit grainy, but this is a B-25 during a strafing run right there.

19:42.034 --> 19:45.318
As you can see, that's below the tree line there.

19:45.338 --> 19:45.638
Yeah.

19:47.575 --> 19:52.420
Over the snow, we've got some a little bit clearer pictures coming up this next picture.

19:52.460 --> 19:55.263
I just I just love this next one coming up.

19:56.865 --> 19:58.407
And I think that we've got it.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.650
There it is.

20:01.670 --> 20:02.872
That's an incredible picture.

20:02.892 --> 20:10.260
That picture is actually even bigger than we can put on our format because it shows the bombs dropping underneath.

20:11.541 --> 20:12.182
But.

20:13.377 --> 20:17.702
That's a formation of B-45s, and that's kind of the formation that you flew in.

20:17.742 --> 20:19.043
There's another angle looking at it.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.229
Pretty impressive right there.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.773
Now, we haven't talked about this yet.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.115
That is your wife, Eddie Ruth, and you.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.178
I believe that's on your anniversary.

20:32.218 --> 20:40.346
This was a picture taken because later on in your retirement, I know that you all had a nursery with a specialty in growing orchids, right?

20:40.366 --> 20:42.709
Well, you know, the strangest part of all this

20:43.364 --> 20:46.669
I was in parts of the world where all this stuff grew.

20:47.049 --> 20:50.875
Never saw it flowering all my life out there in the service anywhere.

20:51.756 --> 20:53.879
And then I worked 10 years in Mexico.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.882
I never saw any orchids down there.

20:57.044 --> 21:03.814
And finally, we had somebody gave us a little plant one time.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.176
And we didn't even know it was an orchid.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.439
We brought it home and it flowered.

21:07.459 --> 21:09.242
Well, we found out it was an orchid.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.245
And from that, why we went crazy.

21:11.967 --> 21:18.795
After I retired, I went back to A&M, took a graduate course in tissue culture to do cloning and this sort of thing.

21:18.995 --> 21:19.236
Right.

21:19.776 --> 21:21.418
And I still do this today.

21:21.438 --> 21:22.139
Yes, sir.

21:22.159 --> 21:27.125
I have a seed bank that goes back for about 40 years.

21:27.245 --> 21:27.506
Right.

21:28.347 --> 21:32.532
And when I retire again, I'm going to start on that seed bank.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.553
That's fantastic.

21:33.972 --> 21:41.662
near the end of the war, but I did want to ask you about where you were when the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

21:41.963 --> 21:48.812
We were in Malabang in Mindanao, which is a big island in the southern part of the Philippines.

21:50.714 --> 21:56.121
And I think I told you that when they dropped the first bomb, nobody believed it.

21:57.443 --> 22:03.591
Everybody, you know, we dropped 2,000 pound bombs and they made a little waiver in the jungle, but

22:03.976 --> 22:06.619
not big enough to wipe out a whole city.

22:06.639 --> 22:07.881
Right.

22:07.901 --> 22:14.790
And it was pretty hard to phantom that they could have something that would wipe out the entire population of one of these places.

22:15.891 --> 22:23.100
And then after they dropped the second bomb, well, then we got enough information that made it sound more feasible.

22:23.561 --> 22:24.342
Right.

22:24.362 --> 22:31.431
So it was pretty hard to imagine that you could carry something that would liquidate that much space.

22:31.451 --> 22:31.671
Right.

22:32.090 --> 22:37.156
Because at the time, I would imagine that your thought was that you would be flying support for a ground invasion in Japan.

22:37.176 --> 22:37.957
Yeah, we would have been.

22:38.017 --> 22:38.938
We would have been.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.119
We would have been.

22:40.360 --> 22:47.027
In fact, that's what we were doing down there, was regrouping and training to go do the invasion.

22:47.748 --> 22:48.068
Indeed.

22:49.310 --> 22:55.657
You finally came home in December of 1945, after the war was over.

22:55.998 --> 22:58.000
You came home on a ship that took about a month.

22:58.380 --> 22:59.341
In January of 1945.

22:59.522 --> 23:01.624
In January, excuse me.

23:02.667 --> 23:28.759
I want you to talk about you came to the west coast and you flew with a friend to Boulder and you bought that friend's father's car, a Model A. Yeah. Tell us what happened after that. Well I spent all my money that I had mustered out with and had to call home to get some money to be able to leave Denver and uh it had snowed. I don't know how much, but it was pretty deep snow up there and we

23:29.482 --> 23:34.727
This guy that I grew up with during the war, we flew together most of the war.

23:36.349 --> 23:42.595
His dad was an old man, and he had a Model A Ford on blocks in a garage.

23:42.615 --> 23:45.218
And he said, let's go see if we can get that thing running.

23:45.258 --> 23:53.246
So we scoured all over Denver to find some retreads to go on it and got it running.

23:54.747 --> 23:59.472
And I left Denver in a snowstorm in that Model A Ford.

24:00.245 --> 24:25.712
and if you've gone from here to Denver, you go through what's called Raton Pass which is a pretty treacherous thing to travel even when it's dry and that old Model A chuggled up that thing like it wasn't anything and everybody else was sliding all over the side of the road and everything else and made it to Dallas in two days. And you're you're bundled up with

24:26.063 --> 24:32.711
I had Marine blankets and a Marine overcoat and everything else because it had an open part of the ceiling.

24:32.771 --> 24:36.695
It rotted off up there, and it was snow and everything coming on the inside.

24:37.656 --> 24:39.779
But made it home.

24:39.799 --> 24:42.502
Going about a max of 40 miles an hour, I guess, right?

24:42.522 --> 24:45.906
Yeah, and I took it to Beaumont.

24:45.926 --> 24:48.949
That's where I was from and got it all cleaned up.

24:49.790 --> 24:57.701
And when I got into A&M, I sold it, which was a big mistake because I sold it because I thought if I came to A&M with it, I wouldn't study.

24:58.122 --> 24:58.382
Right.

24:59.363 --> 25:03.930
But it turned out there were about five cars on the campus in those days.

25:03.990 --> 25:08.456
So you look at it today and you can kind of guess what it would have been like.

25:09.798 --> 25:15.045
Dan, that trip might have been your most dangerous mission of your time away from home was getting from Boulder to Dallas.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.248
It wasn't that bad.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.481
I didn't have any hurry.

25:21.766 --> 25:28.572
You came back to, you attended Lamar in Beaumont for a while and then finally got to A&M, graduated in 49 with...

25:29.075 --> 25:31.479
And entomology was your path.

25:31.499 --> 25:34.645
And I wish we could talk more about that, but we're about to run out of time.

25:34.665 --> 25:37.009
But I want you to talk about your family.

25:37.029 --> 25:42.358
But you did spend some time in Brownsville and in Mexico in entomology.

25:42.398 --> 25:43.761
That was your career.

25:43.781 --> 25:44.983
But I want you to talk about your family.

25:45.003 --> 25:49.370
You have a son and three daughters and, of course, your wife and grandkids and a couple of great-grandkids.

25:49.391 --> 25:53.277
Well, we've been married 60 years, and we had three daughters and three sons.

25:53.398 --> 25:53.698
Yes, sir.

25:54.016 --> 26:03.049
We had two sons that died, one near birth and one at age of about 41 or two years old, maybe.

26:03.069 --> 26:03.430
Excuse me.

26:05.052 --> 26:13.985
And he had epileptic seizures and had a seizure up at the farm when I was there, an unattended seizure, and he suffocated.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.548
Yes, sir.

26:15.988 --> 26:21.216
But anyway, we've got a few grandkids and a couple of great grandkids.

26:21.717 --> 26:22.538
Right.

26:22.973 --> 26:28.399
My wife does Cub Scouts with grandkids.

26:28.680 --> 26:33.185
And I know that you all were very instrumental in the startup of the Brazos Valley Rehabilitation.

26:33.205 --> 26:34.086
We did.

26:34.266 --> 26:41.094
I'm the only charter member still living that was an initial part of that.

26:41.114 --> 26:46.900
And they gave J.O., Alexander, and I, our wives and us were the beginning of it.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.905
But our wives really were the ones that

26:51.138 --> 26:57.084
did the legwork and did most of the work of getting that thing organized to begin with.

26:57.104 --> 26:58.866
Well, it's a wonderful, wonderful facility.

26:58.886 --> 27:01.269
We have a beautiful facility over there next to St.

27:01.309 --> 27:01.589
Joseph's.

27:01.649 --> 27:02.070
Right.

27:02.090 --> 27:03.131
Indeed it is.

27:03.151 --> 27:03.851
We're out of time.

27:03.992 --> 27:04.192
Okay.

27:04.212 --> 27:07.535
Thank you for being here and thank you for your service with the Marines.

27:07.936 --> 27:08.396
Okay.

27:08.416 --> 27:08.977
Thank you, sir.

27:09.137 --> 27:11.079
Thank you for your service.

27:11.099 --> 27:16.605
Texas A&M class of 1949, Dan Chadbourne, waited until after his service to come to A&M.

27:16.906 --> 27:17.888
where he got that degree.

27:17.928 --> 27:23.399
And then the masters, he and his wife, Eddie Ruth, still live in the home they built in Bryan in 1956.

27:24.241 --> 27:27.287
We salute him for his service as we salute all veterans.

27:27.948 --> 27:28.890
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:29.131 --> 27:31.776
Join us again next time on Veterans of the Valley.
