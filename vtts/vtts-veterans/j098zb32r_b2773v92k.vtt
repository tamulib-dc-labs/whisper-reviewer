Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:24.881 --> 00:26.022
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:26.592 --> 00:33.466
As a crew member of an AC-47, Brian Parker says he could not buy a drink anywhere while on active duty in Vietnam.

00:33.847 --> 00:40.500
You see, AC-47s went about the business of saving lives, and it was the pleasure of those survivors to pick up the tap.

00:40.835 --> 00:49.068
When ground troops were surrounded by the enemy, it was the AC-47 gunship that came to the rescue, lighting up the area with flares and bullets.

00:49.088 --> 00:58.624
Brian Parker was a navigator in NOM for 12 months, just part of his 21 years of military service, and it is our pleasure to welcome Lieutenant Colonel Brian Parker.

00:58.604 --> 01:25.017
to veterans of the valley lieutenant colonel parker it is an honor to have you and talk about your vietnam war experience you served 21 years in the military but let's go back before it ever started you were in the very first graduating class of the united states air force academy came over there from baltimore sort of talk about how what got you from baltimore to colorado to the air force academy well when i graduated from high school i

01:25.638 --> 01:28.281
really didn't care to go into education anymore.

01:28.461 --> 01:28.721
Right.

01:29.843 --> 01:34.648
And I had applied for a West Point appointment, and that didn't come through.

01:35.108 --> 01:37.631
I think some big football player got the job.

01:39.293 --> 01:43.537
So I went to work for a friend, digging ditches and doing roofing.

01:44.338 --> 01:52.607
And by the end of the summer, I thought, you know, there must be something better in life than... At that time, we didn't have the ditch diggers.

01:52.627 --> 01:55.510
We did it with a shovel.

01:55.692 --> 02:02.581
I remembered that the track coach at the University of Maryland during the Maryland relays had come up to me.

02:02.601 --> 02:04.904
We had won the relays.

02:04.924 --> 02:09.631
And he said, if you ever decide you want to go to college, come give me a call.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.914
Well, I did in August.

02:11.934 --> 02:20.425
And two years at the University of Maryland, the ROTC instructor said, they're starting a new academy out in Colorado.

02:20.445 --> 02:21.627
Would you like to go?

02:22.368 --> 02:24.130
And I said, well, that sounds great.

02:24.532 --> 02:25.553
What do I do?

02:25.814 --> 02:31.241
And he led me through the paperwork and talked to the senators and congressmen.

02:31.982 --> 02:32.904
I had an appointment.

02:33.765 --> 02:36.469
Then I started running my chin in real strong.

02:38.592 --> 02:42.758
It was kind of like they do out here at the Corps for the fish.

02:43.298 --> 02:47.064
What was the Air Force Academy like as it was just getting started, a brand new school?

02:47.284 --> 02:48.746
It was just temporary buildings.

02:49.707 --> 02:50.168
But...

02:50.857 --> 02:52.158
I had no complaints with that.

02:52.198 --> 03:00.306
I had never had my own room and I had a room with a roommate and a rifle rack and book rack and a desk and everything was just fine for us.

03:01.408 --> 03:03.309
So it was fun, I thought.

03:03.630 --> 03:03.930
Indeed.

03:04.330 --> 03:14.260
Air Force Academy, you went on some field trips while you were there to the Far East and that's where you first got exposed to the 13th Bomb Squadron and you were really enamored by that, weren't you?

03:14.280 --> 03:17.944
As I was growing up, we lived in Baltimore.

03:18.970 --> 03:26.342
And the Martin plant was there, manufacturing the B-57, which was the Canberra bomber.

03:26.362 --> 03:28.305
I said, boy, I'd like to fly that someday.

03:28.325 --> 03:34.074
And when we got to the 13th Bomb Squadron in Japan, there it was, the B-57.

03:34.314 --> 03:43.889
When I graduated from navigator school, I had a choice of B-52s or the B-57 in Japan.

03:43.949 --> 03:45.231
I thought, that's the way to go.

03:46.190 --> 03:54.561
to the B-57, and you graduated from navigator school, one of the top three or four in the class, and therefore you got your choice pretty much of what you wanted to do, right?

03:54.581 --> 04:05.296
We went to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, and that's where you were sort of introduced to the modern warfare that would be used in Vietnam.

04:05.736 --> 04:12.265
After serving four years during the Cold War at Yokota in Japan,

04:12.785 --> 04:16.069
the wing was sent to the Philippines, Clark Air Force Base.

04:17.130 --> 04:17.250
Right.

04:17.270 --> 04:20.814
And there they said the navigator would probably not fly.

04:20.854 --> 04:23.397
They had to have a Vietnamese in the back seat.

04:24.157 --> 04:26.920
So I already had an assignment to the states.

04:26.941 --> 04:30.504
After four years, I said, well, I'll go back to the states.

04:31.045 --> 04:35.089
In the states then, I flew EC 121s out over the North Atlantic.

04:35.290 --> 04:36.531
Right.

04:37.675 --> 04:47.144
About halfway through that tour, a very good friend of mine, Quincy Collins, was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war.

04:47.164 --> 04:48.746
I said, I've got to go back and do something.

04:48.966 --> 04:51.709
So I volunteered to go back in the B-57s.

04:51.809 --> 04:57.254
I had an expert rating and the personnel people said, no problem, we'll get you over there.

04:58.535 --> 05:02.019
Then I was assigned to the AC-47.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.560
That was a mess up.

05:03.981 --> 05:06.383
I think so.

05:06.835 --> 05:13.302
And that pretty much dictated the rest of your way in Vietnam, but you said it was a mess up, that it was an assignment that you enjoyed thoroughly.

05:13.322 --> 05:19.770
It was a thoroughly, rewarding, enjoyable assignment, knowing that you were saving somebody every time you were called out.

05:20.210 --> 05:20.991
Right, right.

05:21.011 --> 05:28.139
I want you to talk more about that because we alluded to that in the introduction when we said that you couldn't go in to get a drink and pay for one.

05:28.179 --> 05:30.582
Everybody wanted to buy your drinks because

05:30.562 --> 05:39.252
The people in Vietnam, the ground soldiers, were truly, for good reason, indebted to the AC-47 because of the ground cover and the support that they gave.

05:41.194 --> 05:49.964
If we went into one of the bars where the Army troops were, they would, of course, find out that we were Air Force and say, what's your call sign?

05:50.004 --> 05:52.247
And we'd say, Spooky 42 or whatever.

05:53.108 --> 05:56.832
And they'd say, you can't buy a drink here.

05:56.852 --> 05:57.753
Why not?

05:57.773 --> 05:58.594
Because we're buying.

05:59.030 --> 06:09.580
And it was very rewarding, even locally, when we were bringing some troops up from the Brook Army Hospital to view an Aggie game.

06:10.741 --> 06:23.313
We had a transportation problem and called around, and Mr. Ed Cravey offered to provide a limo and a town car to show the wounded around town and take them to the game.

06:23.333 --> 06:27.096
It turns out Ed was in Vietnam the same time that I was.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.793
And he said, I'd probably save his life.

06:30.914 --> 06:32.777
That's very rewarding to know.

06:32.817 --> 06:34.259
The numbers are really amazing.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.365
I found this on the internet about the AC-47s under the record.

06:38.786 --> 06:47.679
From 1964 to 1969, the AC-47s successfully defended 3,926 hamlets, outposts, or forts.

06:47.699 --> 06:52.105
They fired over 97 million rounds, killed over 5,300 enemy soldiers,

06:52.507 --> 06:57.015
no outpost or village under gunship protection was ever lost to the enemy.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.579
That's a pretty fascinating record.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.062
That's what made it so rewarding.

07:03.025 --> 07:11.600
When you talk to the guys on the radio going in, it was like they were bowing down to you and saying, thank goodness you're here.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.984
And we fired on the camps themselves.

07:14.084 --> 07:15.587
They said, we're undercover, have at them.

07:15.647 --> 07:15.747
And

07:16.402 --> 07:17.203
We'd hose it down.

07:17.223 --> 07:18.384
They'd say they're going.

07:19.385 --> 07:19.806
They're leaving.

07:20.206 --> 07:28.355
And when they said that they were undercover, they really better mean it because we were talking about the statistical nature of this aircraft, the AC-47.

07:29.456 --> 07:37.545
And talk more about that, about how many rounds you carried, how many rounds it would fire out of three guns, and sort of its coverage area is mind-boggling, really.

07:37.605 --> 07:38.626
Talk about that.

07:38.646 --> 07:45.413
Well, we carried normally a load of 15,000 rounds, 15,500, something like that.

07:46.810 --> 07:54.423
40-some flares depending upon whether we thought we were going to have a lighting mission or a gunning mission or a combination.

07:55.404 --> 07:57.608
The normal load was about 40 and 15,000.

07:57.668 --> 08:06.843
The guns fired 6,000 rounds a minute per gun.

08:06.863 --> 08:09.648
So that's 100 rounds a second per gun.

08:09.848 --> 08:11.451
If you put all three guns on,

08:11.988 --> 08:15.553
A three-second burst will fill every square yard of a football field.

08:15.793 --> 08:16.915
Wow, in three seconds.

08:16.995 --> 08:17.215
Yeah.

08:18.717 --> 08:21.281
And you run out of ammo real quick if you do it that way.

08:21.361 --> 08:27.088
So we normally only put one gun on until we were sure we had the right spot and the bad guys.

08:28.290 --> 08:28.831
Right.

08:28.851 --> 08:33.477
And you would also carry flares anywhere upwards to 40, 45 flares in the plane.

08:33.517 --> 08:35.640
And talk about the flares and the job that they did.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.843
It would light up the area for the ground soldiers, right?

08:38.228 --> 08:40.812
The flares were two million candle power.

08:40.832 --> 08:48.503
They'd burn for about three minutes, which meant we had to make a full circle and come back and drop again in three minutes to keep it continuously illuminated.

08:49.505 --> 08:54.011
We've been on targets where if the flare went out, they started the attack again.

08:54.652 --> 08:57.917
As soon as we dropped the flare, they'd stop the attack.

08:57.937 --> 09:02.283
And then when we knew where they were, of course, we'd put the guns online and have at them.

09:02.303 --> 09:03.946
Right, right.

09:03.966 --> 09:04.827
And the flares would...

09:05.009 --> 09:11.895
would light up the area, you say, for about three minutes, which was enough time for the ground soldiers to do their work to find their enemy.

09:11.915 --> 09:13.796
And that was the point of the whole thing.

09:13.917 --> 09:24.205
One time we were visited by some dignitaries and somebody briefed the dignitary that we kept Saigon under light all night long.

09:24.686 --> 09:24.926
Wow.

09:25.486 --> 09:27.168
And that's not true.

09:27.548 --> 09:28.809
Right.

09:28.829 --> 09:34.594
The later we told them how much those flares cost, they only lasted three minutes of peace.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.376
And they said, okay, only when needed.

09:37.776 --> 09:38.017
Right.

09:38.457 --> 09:42.763
Now, the AC-47 was not involved in air-to-air combat.

09:42.783 --> 09:48.131
You said you think you might have shot down a plane once, but you're not sure that that happened, but mainly it was air-to-ground.

09:49.152 --> 09:49.212
No.

09:49.232 --> 09:52.116
Our crew never shot down, but there is a story.

09:52.156 --> 09:58.425
It's probably one of the urban legends that says they shot down something, but I don't think they did.

09:58.445 --> 10:01.929
Because this plane would fly low, 2,500 to 3,000 feet, right?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.351
Yeah, we could be shot down.

10:03.672 --> 10:03.872
Uh-huh.

10:04.325 --> 10:05.706
At a speed of about what?

10:05.726 --> 10:07.388
120 knots.

10:07.408 --> 10:08.109
120 knots.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.431
So that was fairly slow and low.

10:10.791 --> 10:11.332
Oh, yeah.

10:11.352 --> 10:11.752
Yeah.

10:11.772 --> 10:14.114
And when you went into a circular pattern.

10:14.354 --> 10:15.335
Right.

10:15.355 --> 10:18.538
And you fired out the left side of the aircraft.

10:18.558 --> 10:19.779
So it looked like a cone.

10:21.221 --> 10:26.486
And as you were looking at it from above, it looked like a dragon shooting down at the ground.

10:26.686 --> 10:27.226
Right.

10:27.246 --> 10:30.049
And that's how they got the name the magic dragon.

10:30.069 --> 10:30.309
Right.

10:31.711 --> 10:32.651
Puff the magic dragon.

10:33.172 --> 10:33.252
Yes.

10:33.603 --> 10:34.944
And the call sign was spooky.

10:35.285 --> 10:35.985
Exactly.

10:36.005 --> 10:37.427
There's a story behind that too.

10:37.707 --> 10:38.068
What's that?

10:38.408 --> 10:45.776
As the commander was taking off with a flight of goonie birds to go to Vietnam, it was real foggy.

10:45.796 --> 10:49.259
And he said, boy, this is the spookiest thing I've ever seen.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.584
And after that, so the story goes, the call sign was spooky.

10:54.004 --> 10:55.766
Right.

10:55.786 --> 11:02.513
What, Lieutenant Colonel Parker, was it like, if you can go back that far?

11:02.797 --> 11:08.182
As a navigator, you sat behind the pilots, is that right?

11:09.624 --> 11:14.949
What do you recall as far as your fear factor, your thoughts about where you were, what you were doing?

11:14.989 --> 11:16.751
Most of these missions, I guess, were at night, right?

11:17.492 --> 11:18.553
All of our missions were at night.

11:18.573 --> 11:19.774
Yeah, were at night.

11:20.395 --> 11:26.060
What personally were your thoughts about your own safety, your own mortality, what you were doing?

11:26.200 --> 11:26.981
You were a young guy.

11:27.342 --> 11:28.663
At that time, we were all young.

11:29.223 --> 11:30.084
We were invincible.

11:30.525 --> 11:30.745
Right.

11:31.332 --> 11:37.101
On occasion, we weren't supposed to, but we would fly low over certain areas to see if we could draw ground fire.

11:37.802 --> 11:43.410
That's foolish, but we did it and we survived and we did draw some ground fire and fired back.

11:43.671 --> 11:44.312
Right.

11:44.332 --> 11:56.370
And I don't know, it was so rewarding that we never really had that fear factor except one night we saw all these explosions underneath of us.

11:56.390 --> 11:56.650
Right.

11:56.670 --> 11:59.955
We were flying just a cap around Saigon and Benoit Air Base.

12:00.644 --> 12:06.135
And I immediately got on the radio and called the Tactical Air Control Center and they said, whoops, where are you?

12:07.218 --> 12:07.899
And we told them.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.424
And they said, we've lost you on the radar.

12:12.068 --> 12:14.793
You just survived a B-52 attack.

12:15.836 --> 12:20.425
So evidently we were just behind where the bombs were dropping and

12:21.873 --> 12:23.756
We'd have been a little bit ahead.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.178
We'd have been wiped out for sure.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.746
And the V-52s would have been able to say they took down an airplane.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.989
Exactly.

12:32.009 --> 12:33.752
Albeit the wrong one.

12:33.772 --> 12:39.882
You mentioned when we were talking the other day about your work in Intel.

12:39.862 --> 12:43.107
And I guess that came after your flying time in Vietnam.

12:43.127 --> 12:56.847
And also, I want you to talk about that, and also a situation where you were involved with a Bud Day, who I looked up was actually the most highly decorated soldier of Vietnam, was a POW for some 67 months, Bud Day.

12:57.408 --> 13:00.873
Talk about your job in intel and that.

13:00.893 --> 13:06.662
Well, I volunteered to go back for another six months flying to Gooney Bird, and

13:06.997 --> 13:11.763
Personnel got into the act again and said we needed a target intelligence officer.

13:12.464 --> 13:12.584
Right.

13:12.604 --> 13:15.167
I said, I'm not a target intelligence officer.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.128
And he said, well, yes, you are.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.651
You went through the bomb school when you look at photographs.

13:18.671 --> 13:22.876
So you're a target intelligence officer and we have to have one up there.

13:22.957 --> 13:31.767
So I went up there and I was a senior man as a captain because the lieutenant colonel had already left and he hadn't been replaced.

13:33.009 --> 13:35.912
My job then became briefing the commander, basically.

13:36.213 --> 13:36.413
Right.

13:36.747 --> 13:39.010
We worked with the OSI.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.672
We worked with the Koreans.

13:40.732 --> 13:46.000
We had undercover agents out in the field giving us information.

13:48.343 --> 13:52.849
I was on duty when Bud Day was shot down.

13:53.410 --> 14:01.481
And the junior officer came in and said, Sir, we need you to pull the authenticator cards for Bud Day.

14:01.501 --> 14:02.883
They've been shot down.

14:02.903 --> 14:04.425
And that was really...

14:05.992 --> 14:06.793
Really gets to you.

14:07.074 --> 14:07.895
Yes, sir.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.717
And I've talked with Bud.

14:09.797 --> 14:12.381
We've exchanged a few Christmas cards.

14:12.501 --> 14:13.683
Right.

14:13.703 --> 14:20.092
He's doing good work now and trying to get the benefits for the retired people as promised.

14:20.192 --> 14:24.959
And I believe he's suing the government for something right now, but I'm not quite sure what it is.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.922
But we'll support him in that.

14:27.283 --> 14:27.643
Indeed.

14:27.863 --> 14:28.364
Indeed you will.

14:28.605 --> 14:31.809
Your crew won two Distinguished Flying Crosses.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.513
Talk about that and what led to that.

14:35.725 --> 14:45.737
One night we got a call south of Saigon that some advisors were under attack with their group of Vietnamese.

14:47.058 --> 14:54.507
And they were having trouble seeing the enemy and they were going to be overrun and all the good stuff that they tell you.

14:55.508 --> 14:58.171
We went out and started dropping flares.

14:58.251 --> 15:01.956
As soon as we started dropping the flares, the attack was broken.

15:02.937 --> 15:04.078
But as soon as we'd leave,

15:04.565 --> 15:05.526
it would start up again.

15:06.347 --> 15:22.549
So we stayed and coordinated the efforts of bringing other planes out, landing, refueling, getting more flares and getting back up, firing guns and so on until morning and the good guys were saved again.

15:22.749 --> 15:29.038
Another mission, an outpost was under attack.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.682
We went out, broke the attack.

15:33.143 --> 15:34.285
There were about 400

15:34.940 --> 15:39.147
Vietnamese attacking the outpost.

15:39.548 --> 15:47.963
Confirmed reports were that we had 70 bodies and the rest were either drug off or wounded or survived in some way.

15:49.145 --> 15:55.817
But from our standpoint, we were not really going through a fear factor on that.

15:56.489 --> 16:05.843
We were just doing our job, but the guys on the ground were quite thankful and sent us lots of letters of recommendation, and they awarded us the Distinguished Flying Cross.

16:06.664 --> 16:11.331
And we always never accepted anything for just the pilot or the navigator or anybody.

16:11.351 --> 16:12.973
We accepted it for the whole crew.

16:12.993 --> 16:13.514
Indeed.

16:13.534 --> 16:14.695
Because they all did the job.

16:14.715 --> 16:15.797
Without them, we couldn't have done it.

16:16.283 --> 16:21.049
Your crew of seven, we've got some photographs, and one of the photographs we're going to see is going to be your crew of seven.

16:21.089 --> 16:24.112
I want to go ahead and go to those photographs right now.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.595
Some of these are ones that were supplied by you.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.678
Some others I got off the internet.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.419
There you are.

16:29.559 --> 16:32.082
About how old of an airman are you right there?

16:33.884 --> 16:37.929
I'm about 25 there, and that's in the B-57 in Japan.

16:38.310 --> 16:38.730
I see.

16:40.094 --> 16:42.099
I looked young, didn't I?

16:43.542 --> 16:45.847
This is a photograph that I got off the internet.

16:46.008 --> 16:47.050
It's actually a drawing.

16:47.170 --> 16:51.781
It's a sketching so people can get an idea of the AC-47 and what it looked like.

16:51.801 --> 16:58.035
I guess this is the same plane that later became a passenger plane made by McDonnell Douglas, right?

16:58.353 --> 17:20.850
and uh became a passenger plane that was called i guess a conveyor or dc3 i guess this is the old dc3 that we converted to a ac uh-huh uh the fighters objected to it being called an fc because they said it's not a fighter so they changed it to ac which is attack cargo

17:20.830 --> 17:27.358
And as you can see, the guns, so the three guns were all coming out of the left side of the plane, is that right?

17:27.378 --> 17:32.684
One gun came out the cargo door, and the other two came out the windows.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.007
The windows right next to the, after the cargo door?

17:35.828 --> 17:38.111
Well, forward of the cargo door.

17:39.373 --> 17:43.918
Flying at 3,000 feet in Vietnam got quite chilly.

17:44.523 --> 17:49.389
This, as you can see, is labeled there, the AC-47 Spooky Gunship interior view.

17:49.409 --> 17:52.553
This is the gun bay of one.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.657
You can get sort of an idea of what it looked like on the inside of the ship.

17:55.717 --> 17:56.718
That's the Gatling gun.

17:57.399 --> 18:01.705
It just spun around and fired electronically.

18:01.725 --> 18:06.130
So each one of those, like we said, fired about... 6,000 rounds a minute.

18:06.150 --> 18:11.357
6,000 rounds a minute for about 18,000 rounds a minute because there were three guns coming out of it.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.528
Not a lot of interior decoration inside of those planes.

18:15.548 --> 18:16.009
No, it's not.

18:16.850 --> 18:21.917
This is a photograph of the outside at night of one of the guns firing.

18:23.339 --> 18:27.484
And I guess that's a pretty realistic view of what it looked like.

18:27.585 --> 18:34.754
They had tracers interspersed between the regular rounds, which gave you a stream that looked like the dragon going after you.

18:34.934 --> 18:35.175
Right.

18:35.595 --> 18:40.001
And I think that was as scary as anything else for the guys on the ground that survived.

18:40.442 --> 18:40.602
I think.

18:41.155 --> 18:46.320
Seeing that burst of fire coming at them, they didn't hang around very long in most cases.

18:46.340 --> 18:47.021
I don't imagine.

18:47.281 --> 18:51.365
Okay, we'll move on to the next photograph.

18:51.385 --> 18:59.594
This is a photograph that you supplied of, I guess this is one of the AC-47s that, is this your plane or one that you flew?

18:59.614 --> 19:00.455
We flew a lot of them.

19:00.475 --> 19:05.720
You flew a lot of them, but that's still... There were a total of 53 eventually in Vietnam.

19:05.740 --> 19:10.825
15 were shot down or crashed or hit by a mortar around.

19:11.446 --> 19:16.954
We also had to contend with that because the Army was firing mortars and the Navy was firing salvos.

19:17.514 --> 19:19.898
We had to fly around them.

19:19.918 --> 19:26.447
I don't think any of our planes were hit by a mortar round, but we don't know what took some of them down.

19:26.527 --> 19:27.388
They were tough airplanes.

19:27.929 --> 19:35.599
We took some pretty good, or our aircraft did, but some of them took off parts of the tail and so on.

19:36.020 --> 19:36.981
That's a crew.

19:37.366 --> 19:41.231
There's your crew of seven, and you, I believe you said you're the one on the far left.

19:41.392 --> 19:42.113
Far left.

19:44.276 --> 19:45.818
Of that photograph.

19:45.858 --> 19:48.041
So about what year do you think this would have been taken?

19:48.422 --> 19:49.383
Was this in Vietnam?

19:49.603 --> 19:56.373
This would have been 1966.

19:59.457 --> 20:03.423
And that old fellow there in the middle is the pilot, Harry Corbin.

20:04.865 --> 20:06.527
He was gung-ho.

20:07.148 --> 20:07.288
Mm-hmm.

20:07.673 --> 20:20.151
We'd be on ground alert, and the phone would ring, and Harry would run out to the airplane, and I would be taking down the target information, and you had to run to catch up to him because he was starting to taxi.

20:20.572 --> 20:24.918
And we had a little Vietnamese boy that was translating for us.

20:24.938 --> 20:26.019
He was a lieutenant.

20:26.039 --> 20:26.360
Right.

20:26.440 --> 20:32.449
And he didn't run as fast as we did, so we had to grab him and pull him in the rear door as we were going.

20:32.709 --> 20:32.989
Right.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.333
Harry was really gung-ho.

20:35.573 --> 20:35.853
Right.

20:36.194 --> 20:36.955
And he was...

20:37.137 --> 20:38.438
a World War II veteran.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.365
Several of the pilots we flew with were World War II veterans that flew the hump.

20:44.385 --> 20:45.566
Right, right, right.

20:45.866 --> 20:56.438
I want to talk about your relationship with the 13th Bomb Squadron and the Bomb Squadron Association, of which you are a member, and I believe you either are or were the first vice president of this association.

20:56.458 --> 20:59.561
It's an association that indeed has reunions.

20:59.962 --> 21:01.263
Talk about this association.

21:01.283 --> 21:02.284
I know it means a lot to you.

21:03.614 --> 21:16.675
The World War II veterans of the 13th Bomb Squadron, which dates back to 1917, formed an association that was a very close-knit association of World War II veterans.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.677
Right.

21:17.697 --> 21:22.585
They didn't want to accept the Korean War pilots and navigators into their group.

21:22.925 --> 21:30.297
We were welcome to attend, but the folks that did attend say they didn't feel like a part of the group, so in the year...

21:32.048 --> 21:45.289
In 1984, they formed the 13th Bomb Squadron Association, and it was all inclusive of people from the Korean War era.

21:45.570 --> 21:45.870
Right.

21:46.652 --> 21:54.985
After a while, they began to realize that if they didn't include others, people on active duty and so on,

21:55.960 --> 21:58.723
There would be no more 13th Bomb Squadron Association.

21:58.743 --> 21:59.624
Right.

21:59.644 --> 22:05.650
So in the year 2000, they had instigated with Congress and the Air Force.

22:05.670 --> 22:13.598
They stood up the 13th Bomb Squadron on active duty again at Dias Air Force Base in Texas.

22:13.618 --> 22:13.878
Yes, sir.

22:13.898 --> 22:14.839
In the B-1 bomber.

22:17.863 --> 22:20.065
Last year, they did away with that.

22:20.425 --> 22:22.187
Again, Dias closed down and

22:23.028 --> 22:27.674
We went to the B-2 bomber at Whiteman Air Force Base, which is in Nob Noster.

22:27.954 --> 22:29.156
You know where Nob Noster is?

22:30.177 --> 22:30.738
I've heard of it.

22:30.778 --> 22:32.200
It's outside of Kansas City.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.103
And it's a wonderful airplane.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.087
Everybody doesn't get to see it.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.371
We got to see it, climb in it and look at the controls.

22:41.531 --> 22:43.955
And it's completely different than what we had.

22:46.197 --> 22:49.862
We looked out the window, looked at something on the ground.

22:50.618 --> 22:53.525
And that was our navigation called eyeball navigation.

22:53.545 --> 22:54.206
Right.

22:54.487 --> 23:00.019
Today, they set in coordinates and work a computer console and fly the airplane.

23:00.039 --> 23:04.610
But the most we ever flew in the B-57 was five hours.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.755
These guys fly 40-hour missions.

23:06.775 --> 23:06.855
Wow.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.052
And I don't want to do that.

23:10.874 --> 23:11.675
I want to move along.

23:11.735 --> 23:16.540
You left Vietnam in January of 1968, and you married Fran in May of that year.

23:16.580 --> 23:19.984
I want you to talk about your wife and your family a little bit later.

23:20.004 --> 23:22.507
But when you left Vietnam, you were ready to get home.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.050
As a matter of fact, you could have stayed one more day and seen the Bob Holt Show.

23:25.070 --> 23:25.631
That's correct.

23:25.651 --> 23:28.574
But you said, glad Bob is coming, but I'm going home.

23:28.694 --> 23:29.215
That's right.

23:29.836 --> 23:32.061
I don't want to risk one more mortar attack.

23:34.065 --> 23:45.468
So I came home to the 4412th Combat Crew Training Squadron, which was training the new navigators for Vietnam.

23:45.488 --> 23:49.116
And the first person I met was an old friend from the 13th Bomb Squadron.

23:49.497 --> 23:49.617
Right.

23:50.322 --> 23:52.485
And he said, are you married, Brian?

23:52.505 --> 23:53.026
I said, no.

23:53.246 --> 23:55.309
He says, well, how'd you like a date?

23:57.112 --> 23:59.515
And his wife was a widow, an Air Force widow.

24:00.537 --> 24:10.050
And they arranged with this young lady, this cute young thing that was also an Air Force widow who didn't want anything to do with Air Force people again.

24:10.070 --> 24:10.611
Right.

24:11.172 --> 24:11.873
We got a date.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.558
And that was in January.

24:15.578 --> 24:16.660
And that was in May.

24:17.481 --> 24:18.102
We got married.

24:18.470 --> 24:20.853
And we've lived happily ever after since then.

24:21.113 --> 24:22.134
Indeed.

24:22.955 --> 24:43.180
I want you to talk about, you are very involved in, with veterans, disabled veterans, specifically, I know at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, you have taken some of these soldiers and given them very special times in their life, brought them up to Texas A&M football games and other events.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.763
Talk about that, because I know that's important to you.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.426
That is an extremely rewarding thing.

24:48.777 --> 24:55.626
When you see the eyes light up and the smiles appear, it's the best thing you could possibly be given.

24:57.168 --> 25:11.106
I talk with Mike Caruso out at A&M in the athletic department and the folks over there, and we set up a date and bring them to a football game or a basketball game, and it is really rewarding.

25:11.126 --> 25:14.070
The Bush Library gives them a tour before the game.

25:15.592 --> 25:18.396
We brought up a fellow, Kenny Adams.

25:19.270 --> 25:20.331
who was totally blind.

25:21.072 --> 25:29.603
And at the same time, we had another fellow who had been blinded in one eye and was deaf because of an explosion in Afghanistan.

25:30.604 --> 25:35.871
And they threw out the first pitches at the baseball game for Veterans Day.

25:36.211 --> 25:36.952
I remember that.

25:36.972 --> 25:41.498
And Kenny really got into it, winding up to make the pitch and so on.

25:42.237 --> 25:48.884
While we were at the Bush Library before that, Kenny got to touch everything, and they gave him a real grand tour.

25:49.084 --> 25:50.145
He touched everything.

25:50.185 --> 25:56.992
He got on the mock-up of the railroad train, and he worked the controls, and he was really happy.

25:57.012 --> 26:05.661
And he's married to a beautiful young angel, I call her, the way she takes care of him and just leads his life.

26:05.681 --> 26:06.702
It's just wonderful.

26:07.303 --> 26:11.367
They now have a home in Houston.

26:11.600 --> 26:18.929
The group that I work with, Salute America's Heroes, has made their whole home voice activated.

26:18.949 --> 26:20.210
I'll be darned.

26:20.230 --> 26:28.220
I'm just gnawing at the bit to go down and visit him when we're down there and see how this works, but it's fantastic.

26:29.101 --> 26:34.367
This group, Salute America's Heroes, is trying to raise enough money, and I'm sure they will,

26:34.837 --> 26:41.470
to give each wounded veteran a $500 check for Christmas so that they can buy Christmas presents and so on.

26:42.131 --> 26:43.254
Well, good luck to that.

26:43.274 --> 26:46.059
I wish we could talk more about that, but believe it or not, we're out of time.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.201
It goes fast.

26:47.241 --> 26:51.009
I know there's a lot more to say, but thank you for your service, and thank you for being here.

26:51.029 --> 26:51.630
I appreciate it.

26:52.201 --> 26:53.303
My pleasure, Tom.

26:53.323 --> 26:59.134
Brian Parker's official military service is behind him, but not his service to our military.

26:59.154 --> 27:06.829
It is his passion to make sure that veterans, especially disabled veterans, are able to grasp the best of the freedoms that they helped preserve.

27:07.370 --> 27:10.375
We salute Lieutenant Colonel Brian Parker as we salute all veterans.

27:11.037 --> 27:11.938
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:11.979 --> 27:14.884
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:33.983 --> 27:34.965
and not say anything.

27:35.246 --> 27:35.787
I'll do that.

27:37.250 --> 27:40.697
We're gonna do the promo and then they'll give us the okay to go.

27:44.826 --> 27:46.249
All right.

27:46.770 --> 27:50.338
Here we go.

27:52.090 --> 27:57.179
For a year and a half, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Parker flew the navigator seat in AC.

27:57.239 --> 27:57.620
Wait a second.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.263
I got to do that again because it was just a year.

27:59.303 --> 27:59.683
I'm sorry.

27:59.724 --> 28:00.084
Here we go.

28:00.305 --> 28:00.926
You can stop it.

28:01.647 --> 28:01.887
Okay.

28:01.907 --> 28:02.328
Yeah, go on.

28:02.609 --> 28:02.929
I'm sorry.

28:03.430 --> 28:09.801
It was for a year.

28:09.821 --> 28:10.723
All right, here we go.

28:13.201 --> 28:20.007
For 12 months, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Parker flew the navigator seat in an AC-47 gunship in Vietnam.

28:20.027 --> 28:23.531
It was the attack plane that saved thousands of lives.

28:23.551 --> 28:24.872
You'll hear his story.

28:24.892 --> 28:28.455
You'll hear how he serves today's military veterans.

28:28.476 --> 28:29.697
Hi, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:29.917 --> 28:33.941
Inviting you to meet Lieutenant Colonel Brian Parker on Veterans of the Valley.

28:33.961 --> 28:39.546
It's coming up Friday at 8.30, Saturday and Sunday at 6.30, right here on KAMU-TV.
