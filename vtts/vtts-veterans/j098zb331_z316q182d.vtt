00:08.131 --> 00:32.262
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.643 --> 00:33.784
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:35.131 --> 00:40.024
January the 16th, 1991 is an evening that few of us will ever forget.

00:40.044 --> 00:43.693
Maybe you've forgotten the exact date, but certainly not the event.

00:44.194 --> 00:49.849
We were glued to our televisions, from before dinner time to dawn the next morning and beyond.

00:50.099 --> 00:53.585
We watched reporters tell us their stories through gas masks.

00:54.386 --> 00:59.736
And soon missiles called Patriot and Scud would become part of our everyday conversation.

01:00.437 --> 01:04.644
That night, which was actually 2.38 the next morning in Kuwait, U.S.

01:04.704 --> 01:09.913
warplanes attacked Baghdad, Kuwait, and other military targets of Iraq.

01:10.653 --> 01:13.998
Operation Desert Shield had become Operation Desert Storm.

01:14.558 --> 01:20.346
Randy South was a mortarman with 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, a long, long way from home.

01:20.627 --> 01:21.167
Randy, welcome.

01:21.508 --> 01:22.690
Thank you.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.532
Talk a little bit about that.

01:24.692 --> 01:34.686
You were actually on the ground deployed long before the media knew it and had told us back in the United States before the air war started on that morning of January the 17th in Iraq.

01:34.868 --> 01:35.549
Right.

01:35.790 --> 01:39.696
We had gotten there like two days before the air war started.

01:39.716 --> 01:43.202
But we were deployed before that for a contingency anywhere else in the world.

01:43.222 --> 01:45.746
So they kept us there because of the Philippines.

01:45.766 --> 01:47.149
It was acting up a little bit of that area.

01:47.770 --> 01:52.457
And then two days before the war started, they moved us into Iraq and then like spent a night there.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.781
And then the next day and then that night, that's when the air war started.

01:55.162 --> 01:55.763
Indeed.

01:55.743 --> 02:01.611
Let's go back and talk about when you first enlisted in 1987.

02:01.651 --> 02:04.194
You were actually too young to get in on your own, right?

02:04.234 --> 02:10.482
I was 17 years old and my mother and father had to sign for me to get into the Marine Corps.

02:11.163 --> 02:13.406
As you know, because I wasn't an adult yet, but I could sign up.

02:13.426 --> 02:16.790
But they had to sign for me saying that that was okay to do that.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.072
Why did you want to go that route?

02:19.655 --> 02:20.516
You know, I really don't know.

02:20.556 --> 02:33.974
I just, I wasn't really ready for college yet, and I had a friend that went into the Marine Corps, and I was just kind of looking around, and I went into the Marine Corps office here in College Station, started talking to them a little bit, and next thing I know, I signed up and went.

02:34.175 --> 02:42.726
Now, for training, you were sent off to Hawaii, which was, I guess, a better place to be than where you were about to be, but talk a little bit about your training before you were deployed.

02:43.043 --> 02:52.847
Before we deployed, I mean, every year we went on a six-month deployment, you know, to Okinawa, Japan, and then from there you maybe went to the Philippines, and you just, you're also the contingency.

02:53.448 --> 02:58.420
You know, you were supposed to be the first ones to go somewhere, while the other guys stateside, you know, you were the first ones to have to go.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.243
It didn't work out that way with Saudi Arabia.

03:00.644 --> 03:03.949
And with the Iraq situation, it was kind of different.

03:04.030 --> 03:11.883
But we performed a lot of gas exercises when we knew that Iraq may have been trying, because he did use gas a lot.

03:11.903 --> 03:19.075
So we were practicing nuclear, biological, clinical warfare quite a bit, which is something we did.

03:19.055 --> 03:22.583
You know, we did it before this thing had broke out.

03:22.603 --> 03:28.516
We did it quite a bit, but not as hard as we did it when we knew that we may have a chance to go to Iraq.

03:28.536 --> 03:29.157
Right, right.

03:29.899 --> 03:37.435
And then you were deployed, and you had been trained well, and it was tough training, especially training for...

03:37.415 --> 03:39.558
biological type warfare.

03:39.938 --> 03:41.580
Yeah, it's very difficult to fight.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.043
The gear you wear is very cumbersome.

03:44.103 --> 03:46.486
Your vision is limited.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.089
It's very hot in those gears.

03:49.129 --> 03:59.722
I mean, you know, you will actually, you know, friends who are really good friends start to get after each other a little bit because it's just so you can't move very well.

03:59.742 --> 04:02.826
It's hard to fire your weapon, and it's a difficult way to fight.

04:02.866 --> 04:06.190
You know, you'd rather not fight in a chemical environment if you had to, but

04:06.575 --> 04:10.444
We were prepared for it and we could do it, but it's very difficult.

04:11.205 --> 04:19.183
We talked when we were talking earlier about the communication over there and you were able to communicate with your family back home and I want you to tell the story about

04:19.703 --> 04:23.948
The day before the air battle began, you didn't really know that it was going to begin that day.

04:24.349 --> 04:25.750
But you were talking to your dad.

04:26.331 --> 04:28.314
Randy's dad, by the way, is Dave South.

04:28.354 --> 04:32.058
Everybody knows is the very familiar voice of Texas A&M Athletics.

04:32.098 --> 04:38.807
You were talking to your dad, actually, the day before the air war started to talk a little bit about that and the consternation it caused him.

04:38.827 --> 04:39.047
Right.

04:39.968 --> 04:46.336
When we had got there, they had MCI and AT&T had set up these huge phone tents.

04:47.197 --> 04:48.799
And it was...

04:48.779 --> 04:52.970
It was kind of unique in that, you know, in the rear bases, this is the way it was set up.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.078
So you could call home and, you know, talk to your family like that.

04:56.118 --> 04:57.742
They actually cut it off after the war started.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.908
You know, those phones were cut off.

04:59.968 --> 05:04.640
They didn't have any communication allowed back just in case somebody was monitoring or said something wrong.

05:04.661 --> 05:05.623
But...

05:06.295 --> 05:09.482
I had called him the day before the airway started and I had talked to him a little bit on the phone.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.613
And building up to that, you know, the anxiety before you go is the hardest part, the anxiety.

05:14.633 --> 05:18.502
And then when I called him when I got there, I told him everything's fine, you know, this is where I'm supposed to be.

05:18.542 --> 05:21.970
I feel comfortable with being here and everything's going to be all right.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.052
Don't worry about anything you hear.

05:23.894 --> 05:25.317
You'll hear from me again.

05:25.297 --> 05:26.819
And then that night the air war broke out.

05:26.839 --> 05:29.243
Well, he thought I knew something, and I really didn't.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.305
I was just trying to comfort them.

05:30.325 --> 05:35.313
Well, then the air war broke out, so they're thinking, well, he must have known something, and now it's all broke out, and he just didn't want to tell us.

05:35.333 --> 05:41.382
So they were on their heels a little bit until I was able to converse with them again and tell them.

05:41.362 --> 05:49.118
So you all are deployed, and you meet up with some other troops, and I think they were, or you all were joking that you're waiting for the 2nd and 3rd to get there before you start this thing?

05:49.178 --> 05:49.359
Right.

05:49.419 --> 05:51.704
I was in 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, and we were deployed.

05:51.724 --> 05:56.053
Our sister units were 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, and they were already in Iraq.

05:56.474 --> 06:01.885
Well, then when we got there, you know, the joke was, you know, because the war started right after that, you know, they waited to start it before we got here.

06:02.303 --> 06:27.130
know so everything could be handled correctly and they you know because they've been sitting over there for six months in the hot desert when i got there was more a cool time it was uh you know not as hot as the summer is it was like in february you know january february in that area so it wasn't as bad you know we had we had it pretty good actually because we stayed in okinawa with the comforts of you know being able to you know do anything you want to do you know eat sleep watch watch movies whatever you know without having to be in the field and then when we got there

06:27.110 --> 06:31.578
It was just kind of a joke, a running joke, just messing with them a little bit.

06:32.219 --> 06:32.920
All in good fun.

06:32.940 --> 06:37.268
A lot of your job with the 3rd Marines was involved in POWs, collecting POWs.

06:38.410 --> 06:43.279
Talk about that aspect of it and the kind of people these POWs were.

06:43.394 --> 06:45.277
Right.

06:45.919 --> 06:59.023
When we got into the action and stuff like that, we started taking on so many POWs, and we were using a lot of psychological type warfare on them, dropping pamphlets on them, which you'll have some here in the show.

06:59.594 --> 07:05.000
And the type of troops that were on the front line had been bombed for like 30 days straight from the air.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.123
And some of them were 16 years old.

07:08.183 --> 07:10.926
Some of them looked like they were 60 years old.

07:10.946 --> 07:15.110
And these were guys they just threw out there, you know, like cannon fodder just to slow stuff down.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.631
And they weren't motivated to fight.

07:16.651 --> 07:17.632
They weren't motivated to be there.

07:17.652 --> 07:19.915
These were just common people, not really trained that well.

07:20.836 --> 07:26.642
And, you know, you started kind of having compassion for them, you know, because you could tell they did not want to be there.

07:27.563 --> 07:29.044
And we took on so many.

07:29.513 --> 07:31.095
that we did have to serve other billets.

07:31.135 --> 07:36.823
I mean, I had to drive a truck with, you know, I never really have driven any military vehicle, really.

07:37.284 --> 07:41.450
And we were having to drive trucks to take them back to POW camps, and just, you know, because we took on so many.

07:41.470 --> 07:42.311
I mean, they were coming up to you.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.673
It was almost, we were mixed in with them.

07:43.693 --> 07:45.275
Most of the time, you keep your POWs at a distance.

07:45.796 --> 07:49.541
Well, you know, you'd find this crammed in there with them, sitting there with a rifle, but, you know, mixed all in with them.

07:49.561 --> 07:56.230
You know, it was just, we had so many, and you could tell they just, they just weren't going to fight, and they just wanted out of it.

07:56.210 --> 08:05.939
And so we took them back to camps and fed them, and, you know, they much more enjoyed that where we were at than out there just getting bombarded all day long with, you know, our airplanes.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.740
It was just pretty bad on them.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.181
Yeah.

08:08.201 --> 08:11.224
You got into a conversational relationship with a fellow named Ali.

08:11.644 --> 08:12.204
Talk about Ali.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.806
We just started talking.

08:14.006 --> 08:18.170
You know, he made a gesture, you know, this gesture, you know, about do I have a smoke?

08:18.190 --> 08:18.630
And I said no.

08:18.650 --> 08:21.132
And then I found him one and gave him one, and he said, what is your name?

08:21.152 --> 08:22.293
And I told him, I said, what's your name?

08:22.894 --> 08:23.615
And he spoke perfectly.

08:23.635 --> 08:26.217
He looks like we are now, you know, a little bit of an accent.

08:26.197 --> 08:29.523
And I asked him, how long have you been in the Army?

08:29.783 --> 08:32.367
And he asked me what month this was.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.471
And I told him, he said, maybe two months, three months.

08:34.491 --> 08:35.332
I said, I'm not really sure.

08:35.352 --> 08:37.576
And I said, are you in the reserves?

08:37.596 --> 08:38.858
And he's like, he didn't know what that meant.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.401
He said, I'm not sure what you mean.

08:40.461 --> 08:42.324
I said, well, why'd you join?

08:42.364 --> 08:43.065
He said, I didn't.

08:43.085 --> 08:46.491
You know, they came to my house and they said, you know, pack your stuff, you're going.

08:46.511 --> 08:48.194
And if you don't, we'll gouge your wife's eyes out.

08:48.214 --> 08:49.656
He made this gesture.

08:49.636 --> 08:52.000
And then you realize they're ruled by fear.

08:52.701 --> 08:57.911
And he kept saying to me, you know, he would say, you know, this is not between Ali and Randy.

08:57.931 --> 08:59.734
This is Bush and Saddam, and he would do this.

09:00.656 --> 09:07.768
And, you know, just a common guy, just thrown out there to the wolves, you know, and, you know, he was just a normal guy.

09:07.808 --> 09:13.939
He didn't want to fight, didn't believe they needed to be in Kuwait, and wanted to go home and see his family.

09:14.122 --> 09:15.545
Were they scared?

09:15.565 --> 09:19.933
I know you told me about an incident where some drones flew over and it kind of freaked them out, right?

09:20.154 --> 09:31.776
Well, because, you know, that 30 days of bombarding, and one time I read a diary off an Iraqi lieutenant officer, and he was talking about how every day, it was almost every day after the air war had started,

09:31.756 --> 09:34.963
how they were getting bombed just every day.

09:35.003 --> 09:37.127
I mean, it would start off, you know, January 15th.

09:37.248 --> 09:38.831
We've got, you know, today, aerial attacks.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.817
16th, you know, nighttime attacks.

09:41.838 --> 09:42.679
And it just never quit.

09:43.722 --> 09:49.774
And, you know, I think that just demoralized them to the point that, you know, they were just scared to death.

09:49.794 --> 09:50.997
So we were collecting them one day.

09:50.977 --> 09:52.040
And a drone flew over.

09:52.080 --> 10:03.467
The drones, they take the pictures of everything and try to take it back and then they analyze it and they send troops over there or send planes over there or salvos from a battleship over there to hit that area.

10:03.886 --> 10:06.490
And when the drone flew over, every one of them hit the deck.

10:06.510 --> 10:09.014
You know, they thought that was, you know, they were fixing to get bombed again.

10:09.034 --> 10:11.599
And, you know, we just realized we looked up there now, it's a drone.

10:11.619 --> 10:15.224
We just picked him up and put him in the truck and took him back.

10:15.245 --> 10:19.151
But they were frightened to death of any kind of air support that came over him.

10:19.171 --> 10:21.915
Because they had no air cover for them at all.

10:21.995 --> 10:24.780
We had air superiority and it just changed the whole war right there.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.525
Let's take a look at some photographs that you brought back from the Persian Gulf.

10:29.286 --> 10:29.386
Okay.

10:29.406 --> 10:35.093
And I've sort of put them up here on, sort of talk about those as we're looking at them on the screen.

10:35.113 --> 10:37.416
The top left, that's a young Randy South, right?

10:37.436 --> 10:38.598
Yeah, that was a young man then.

10:40.800 --> 10:46.127
That's actually, the top left one, that's actually a flag that a Kuwait drove by and had

10:46.107 --> 10:53.498
He was in a civilian car and he came by and he threw us that flag thanking us for liberating Kuwait.

10:53.538 --> 10:54.920
He threw it at us and we just kept it.

10:55.782 --> 11:00.088
And the bottom left, that's actually a POW camp.

11:00.108 --> 11:03.373
Those are all POWs lined up in single file and they're in the green.

11:03.353 --> 11:09.623
And we're just marching them in there and they're getting, you know, each one of them is getting searched again and then they're going to take them in there and they're going to feed them.

11:09.643 --> 11:16.072
So those are the POWs that are sort of crouched down outside the transport vehicle that I guess you had just driven, right?

11:16.093 --> 11:18.596
Right, and that's just, I mean, that's not even a fraction of them.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.643
You know, it looked like, you know, an Aggie football game at some time.

11:22.663 --> 11:26.368
You know, all the people coming in, I mean, that's how it looked.

11:26.769 --> 11:27.810
Just so many of them.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.154
And then the top right one, that's an RPG I found.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.380
There's weapons laying all over the desert.

11:33.323 --> 11:34.366
Land mines laying all over the desert.

11:34.386 --> 11:35.428
You had to kind of watch where you walked.

11:35.469 --> 11:42.287
And, you know, AK-47s, I mean, just stacks of them, you know, just hundreds of them and hundreds of RPGs.

11:42.655 --> 11:50.487
The bottom right one, I don't know if you saw or not, that was the oil wells that they were capping as they left Kuwait, and they were blowing them up.

11:50.507 --> 11:50.968
I see.

11:50.988 --> 11:53.532
And then, you know, they were just going to ruin all of Kuwait's oil.

11:53.952 --> 11:55.254
If they can't have it, nobody can.

11:55.294 --> 12:01.504
And then, actually, on our way back after the war was over, I think it was Red Adair Group, they were over there already fixing those.

12:01.544 --> 12:10.057
I mean, after the war was over, maybe a day, you know, we started coming back to our base in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, and they are already capping those oil wells.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.599
It was pretty fast how they got out there.

12:12.490 --> 12:19.682
It's getting back to your being on the ground in the Persian Gulf and

12:20.438 --> 12:27.146
I know you're going to show us some Iraqi equipment, including a gas mask, but you had your own gas mask and you were trained in this.

12:27.687 --> 12:30.711
But there were a lot of rumors that you had to fight off about when to use it.

12:30.731 --> 12:31.532
Is it coming now?

12:31.572 --> 12:33.074
There were some false alarms.

12:33.454 --> 12:35.297
Talk about that aspect of what you had to deal with.

12:35.317 --> 12:43.007
On the first night when they came in and told us, well, second night on ground when the air war started, they came in and opened up our tent and they said, you know, we're bombing Iraq.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.168
So we're all like, okay.

12:44.873 --> 12:48.198
Well, then about 30 minutes later, somebody comes running through there yelling, gas, gas, gas.

12:48.238 --> 12:53.065
That's the universal warning to don your gas mask.

12:53.085 --> 12:55.849
And at this time, we're so far away from the front line.

12:55.889 --> 12:57.030
I mean, we're not even on the front line.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.292
We're like deep into Saudi Arabia.

12:58.492 --> 13:01.336
And we're thinking, wow, he's already launched these things this far.

13:01.356 --> 13:02.138
I mean, how does that happen?

13:02.158 --> 13:04.561
And then so we all put our gas mask on.

13:04.581 --> 13:06.804
And then it was a scuttlebutt, which is a rumor.

13:06.824 --> 13:08.166
That's what the Marine Corps calls a rumor.

13:08.907 --> 13:11.531
And somebody just got the wrong word.

13:11.551 --> 13:14.475
So there was no gas launch status at that time.

13:14.573 --> 13:20.182
But it got cold at night in the desert, really cold, and we were dressed up in desert gear.

13:21.023 --> 13:27.714
So one time we just took our chemical suits out because we knew how hot they were when we were training and put those on, and that kept us warm.

13:27.754 --> 13:32.742
Some guys, and this is actually true, some guys at night, everybody carries a body bag.

13:32.762 --> 13:33.924
You know, I carry one for myself.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.588
That way if I get hit, you know, you look on my pack, there's my body bag.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.570
You put me in it and send me home.

13:37.590 --> 13:38.631
That's just you carry it, you know.

13:38.912 --> 13:39.012
Sure.

13:39.312 --> 13:40.694
And some guys would sleep in those things.

13:40.734 --> 13:41.514
I never could do it.

13:42.436 --> 13:44.498
I just didn't want to sleep in my body bag because it was cold.

13:44.518 --> 13:47.842
And sometimes you look over and they're zipped up in their body bag, just kind of laying in there.

13:47.862 --> 13:48.542
That's what they're going to use.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.824
I said, no, I'm not going to do that.

13:50.324 --> 13:53.528
You want anybody to have the idea that that should be a permanent type of thing.

13:53.548 --> 13:55.430
They're using it like a sleeping bag, you know, what they're using it for.

13:55.450 --> 13:56.812
I was like, no, I'm not using my body bag.

13:57.392 --> 13:57.993
Oh, my goodness.

13:58.393 --> 14:06.182
You talked about taking some resistance, some artillery resistance, but the kind of resistance you took was pretty much hit and miss on the part of the Iraqis.

14:06.222 --> 14:07.944
They had no forward observer.

14:08.004 --> 14:08.745
Talk about that.

14:09.485 --> 14:13.213
An artillery piece and a mortar piece, they have what is called a forward observer.

14:13.233 --> 14:16.360
He is the eyes of the weapon because that weapon does not see what it shoots.

14:17.162 --> 14:23.275
So you have a guy out there with binoculars and a radio and a compass, and he's looking around with his map, and he's finding targets, and he's calling it back to them, and they'll shoot it.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.121
Well, Iraq didn't have any forward observers.

14:25.141 --> 14:26.804
They didn't have any guys that far up.

14:27.325 --> 14:35.140
So they would bring their artillery pieces out, and they would just, you know, charge them up, you know, full charge, and then they'd launch it and just hope they hit something, a lot like the Scud.

14:36.062 --> 14:39.428
And the Scud did do some damage, but it's not a pinpoint weapon.

14:39.488 --> 14:44.257
It just goes up there and floats around in the atmosphere and lands, you know, like the buzz bombs in World War II.

14:44.277 --> 14:44.858
They just...

14:44.838 --> 14:49.744
knew how far it was, and they engineered it to land on the continent of England.

14:49.784 --> 14:50.204
Same thing.

14:50.244 --> 14:56.892
I mean, they would shoot their scuds and land like that, and they would shoot their artillery just blindly.

14:56.912 --> 15:00.977
And what would happen was is we had air superiority, so they're flying around at nighttime.

15:00.997 --> 15:03.921
They'll see a flash in an area that they know we're not in.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.045
The planes would go down, and they would hit that area where they saw that muzzle flash.

15:07.365 --> 15:13.292
We had counter-artillery batteries who had a radar, so when it came over, it would pick up that trajectory.

15:13.660 --> 15:17.408
And then they would relay it to their guns and they would fire right back on that position.

15:17.428 --> 15:24.544
So, I mean, any time they did it, they lost that gun because they would get immediately attacked and they would take out that gun that shot at us.

15:24.745 --> 15:26.108
Some of them did land close to us.

15:26.789 --> 15:31.500
It's a, you know, an artillery shell has a, I think it was,

15:31.649 --> 15:39.362
150-meter effective radius, which means not to kill, but maybe maim you or hit you, because you don't have to kill somebody to make them not fight.

15:39.382 --> 15:45.532
You can hit their lay, you can do little things like that to make them not able to run, and they're not able to fight anymore.

15:46.533 --> 15:49.919
But none of them, I don't think we suffered one casualty from that.

15:49.939 --> 15:53.364
Most of our casualties actually were friendly fire, and that's the bad thing.

15:53.404 --> 15:58.753
But we had very, I don't think we had any kills by the Iraqis on our unit, personally.

15:58.987 --> 16:00.995
You went to the Persian Gulf as a mortar man.

16:01.055 --> 16:05.070
You were trained that way, but then eventually you were trained as a forward observer yourself.

16:06.094 --> 16:08.102
That sounds like a dangerous job.

16:09.078 --> 16:11.061
Yeah, I mean, you know, you go out with the line companies.

16:11.242 --> 16:16.270
You know, you're out there with the line company as the infantry soldier, you know, the rifleman.

16:16.290 --> 16:21.258
And, you know, you have the radio and you're always with the officer or you're with the air officers.

16:21.318 --> 16:31.896
I mean, you kind of hang out with them because all line companies also have an air officer who calls in plane support because he knows how to talk to the air officers, you know, the pilots, I should say.

16:32.804 --> 16:39.374
And so sometimes you maybe shoot smoke out and then they would call in the bird and say, okay, you see the white smoke, you know, the red smoke, whatever, that's where he wants you to hit.

16:42.239 --> 16:50.492
You're on the front with everybody else, you know, but, I mean, any place out there, I mean, is dangerous because, I mean, you want to take out somebody's artillery even though they're further back than the line company because

16:50.472 --> 17:15.923
they can make your life miserable you want to take out the mortars because they can make your life miserable so uh the lines do have it no line companies do have it uh you know it's a lot more dangerous but you know out there i mean everybody's free game it's it's dangerous for everybody you talked about the leaflets that were that were dropped uh to try to i guess uh sway the the iraqis what was going on and you brought some back and we've got some here

17:15.903 --> 17:18.287
These are some of the few that you have.

17:18.347 --> 17:19.469
Talk a little bit about those.

17:19.549 --> 17:21.052
Top left.

17:21.252 --> 17:27.684
Now, these were actually, I don't know if the camera can pick it up, but these were sort of sealed in plastic, and they were dropped from the planes.

17:27.704 --> 17:29.186
Yeah, they were actually not sealed in plastic.

17:29.206 --> 17:30.429
They were paper.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.973
I sealed them just to protect them out with a laminate.

17:33.694 --> 17:35.818
But, yeah, they would drop those just...

17:35.798 --> 17:40.904
in these capsules that would just open up and just blow this litter all over the place.

17:41.325 --> 17:42.687
And you were trying to get onto their troops.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.709
One, you had troops that hadn't been fed in a while.

17:44.729 --> 17:45.650
They had no communication.

17:45.670 --> 17:46.692
We knocked out all that stuff.

17:46.712 --> 17:47.893
So they're disarrayed.

17:47.913 --> 17:49.235
They're not motivated.

17:49.255 --> 17:53.500
And so you drop these leaflets on them to try to coerce them, to come over to your side.

17:54.221 --> 18:03.072
And then on the top left, when you see where he's on the left-hand side of that particular leaflet, it shows them all sitting around eating, having a good time.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.712
And then it shows this Iraqi, hey, you can come join us.

18:06.933 --> 18:13.139
The explanation on these is to hold it in the air if you ever see one, to hold that thing in the air and we'll know you want to quit.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.981
We know you want to give up.

18:15.001 --> 18:20.846
And it shows him how he's explained to him that there's a Saudi soldier talking to the Iraqi soldier, hey, hold it in the air and come over and join us to eat.

18:21.647 --> 18:25.931
And then on the bottom left one, it shows an Iraqi tank getting hit by a stealth.

18:25.951 --> 18:31.075
I don't know if you can really see it, but it's like an invisible jet there on the left-hand side right above the tank.

18:31.095 --> 18:31.776
And then it shows our

18:32.110 --> 18:35.517
Superior tanks and a superior helicopter just destroying their tanks at will.

18:36.398 --> 18:43.793
And then the top right, of course, that's Saddam himself, you know, surrounded by, you know, all these different guns on a broken tank.

18:43.813 --> 18:45.496
You know, showing he just doesn't have a chance.

18:45.556 --> 18:49.163
And then the bottom right one, that's all the countries that are against you.

18:49.183 --> 18:50.706
You know, this is all our countries.

18:50.726 --> 18:52.710
We have, you have Saddam, and he's got nothing.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.832
You know, basically that's...

18:54.166 --> 19:02.421
The psychological warfare, trying to get untrained, or not, most of them untrained, unmotivated troops to realize you're fighting a lost cause, don't die for it.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.575
Did you find that they were having an effect?

19:04.595 --> 19:05.416
Oh, they had a big effect.

19:05.476 --> 19:05.877
Oh, yeah.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.460
They'd come up with two or three little things in their hands, just waving them.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.381
You know, they just found it meaningful.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.564
You got guys of handfuls of them just showing them to everybody.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.308
And, yeah, those were very effective.

19:15.348 --> 19:19.473
And they're very effective against people who just, their morale is low.

19:19.493 --> 19:23.398
I mean, it's a motivator for them, like, I'm not dying for this.

19:23.438 --> 19:24.319
And look at these.

19:24.339 --> 19:25.181
They said they're going to treat us good.

19:25.201 --> 19:25.541
And we did.

19:25.561 --> 19:26.442
We treated them very well.

19:27.043 --> 19:30.467
All those POWs that we had, every one of them got mills, sometimes our own mills.

19:30.532 --> 19:37.098
You know, if we had meals in our backpack, you know, we didn't have enough to feed all of them, and we had, we would have to take our own out and hand it to them, you know, and feed them.

19:37.118 --> 19:39.327
And so they got treated very well, you know.

19:40.083 --> 19:46.130
I asked you if you were scared, and you said that most of your fright had to do with the buildup before you got there.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.615
Right, the anxiety, because at one point, there's a lot of rumors floating around.

19:49.635 --> 19:50.816
You're going, you're not going.

19:50.836 --> 19:51.737
You're going, you're not going.

19:51.757 --> 19:55.542
We'd have everything built up, and then all of a sudden, you're not going.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.784
And then you start hearing the news all the time.

19:58.105 --> 20:02.070
At the time, we were in Oklahoma, so we saw the news nightly about how he's going to use gas and how this.

20:02.150 --> 20:04.212
And he did.

20:04.232 --> 20:06.495
He had the largest army in the Arab world.

20:07.505 --> 20:14.732
And when that happens, you know, all the anxiety is building up, you know, and you just, you know, you were kind of scared then.

20:14.953 --> 20:21.019
But, and it was, I don't know if it's, you know, if it's the same for everybody, but the minute I got in country, I had no more fear at all.

20:21.499 --> 20:23.582
And, you know, it's not that I'm a tough guy and I'm not afraid.

20:24.022 --> 20:24.683
It just went away.

20:25.744 --> 20:30.509
I just, I felt like this is where I need to be, and I felt comfortable over there, and I felt comfortable in whatever I had to do.

20:30.569 --> 20:33.352
And you had adrenaline, but it's different from fear.

20:33.412 --> 20:35.554
You know, I think the fear build up,

20:35.534 --> 20:51.501
was the worst, and then once I got over there, I wasn't, it was just adrenaline, and I was ready to, actually, it was the most fun I ever had in the Marine Corps was during that time, and I don't like war or anything, but it was, it was watching the Marine Corps work or what it's supposed to do, and it's really amazing what it can do.

20:51.481 --> 20:56.789
Did you all have the perception at the time that this was not going to last long, and did that keep your spirits up?

20:56.849 --> 21:02.617
Did you know that this was going to be something that would be relatively a short-lived conflict?

21:02.737 --> 21:03.198
Right.

21:03.218 --> 21:07.544
It's kind of funny, because you ask people their opinion on other Marines, and you get some crazy answers.

21:07.604 --> 21:10.468
Like, I had a Marine Corps officer who was an Aggie, and I like him.

21:10.949 --> 21:14.114
He said, well, the mechanized infantry they got is 48 months.

21:14.134 --> 21:15.255
You know, 48 months?

21:15.395 --> 21:16.076
That's a long time.

21:16.417 --> 21:17.218
But I was just...

21:17.198 --> 21:18.460
I started thinking about myself.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.763
I was thinking air superiority.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.245
I kept thinking about that.

21:21.285 --> 21:26.134
I was like, you know, if you don't have the air, I mean, you don't really have anything.

21:26.174 --> 21:27.196
I mean, you need air.

21:27.236 --> 21:28.578
You need people to protect your people.

21:28.619 --> 21:32.726
You need people to go out and hit the other people's troops and armor and everything like that.

21:32.786 --> 21:33.908
I really thought...

21:33.888 --> 21:39.241
I said, I didn't think it was going to be that long because I thought that we could really do a lot of damage to him.

21:39.261 --> 21:40.545
And they didn't have a Navy.

21:40.565 --> 21:46.740
We could bring our battleships right into the Persian Gulf and then shoot 16-inch guns on them at any time we wanted.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.888
And we could bomb them at any time we wanted from the air.

21:49.919 --> 21:51.442
And I really didn't think it was going to last that long.

21:51.462 --> 21:55.008
I didn't know how long, but not anywhere close to 48 months.

21:55.068 --> 21:56.931
I thought that was way too long.

21:58.253 --> 22:04.985
Let's take a look at some of the things that you brought today, some of the artifacts that you brought with you.

22:05.025 --> 22:08.611
I'm going to reach down here in front of our camera and give that to you and hold that up.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.194
This is an Iraqi helmet.

22:10.214 --> 22:11.255
I got this out of it in a tank.

22:11.957 --> 22:12.838
It's just the liner, though.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.993
I mean, this is kind of what our guys had in World War II.

22:16.013 --> 22:18.480
You know, you had this and you put the steel pot on this.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.045
Well, they just were wearing the liners.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.492
You know, and a lot of the troops just had the liners.

22:22.512 --> 22:24.077
You know, they're not well...

22:24.192 --> 22:25.434
They didn't have the best of gear.

22:26.215 --> 22:30.020
And I got this off, I think, a T-55 Russian tank.

22:30.861 --> 22:32.263
And it was just in there, and I just grabbed it.

22:32.603 --> 22:37.090
I feel like we're show and tell.

22:37.110 --> 22:39.413
This is a gas mask, Iraqi gas mask.

22:41.115 --> 22:41.936
Probably Russian, too.

22:41.956 --> 22:43.919
A lot of their equipment was Russian.

22:43.939 --> 22:46.522
That's just an Iraqi gas mask.

22:46.562 --> 22:48.445
The filter actually goes right here.

22:48.509 --> 22:55.821
And what's kind of interesting about this, our gas mask, we actually had a nozzle you could pull down, and you could put your canteen into it, and you could drink water if you had to wear this.

22:55.841 --> 22:56.822
And I don't see that on these.

22:56.882 --> 23:02.952
So if you ever got thirsty, it'd probably be a long time until you got out of the area that's contaminated.

23:03.473 --> 23:07.159
If you were thirsty, you'd probably have to wait a long time.

23:07.139 --> 23:07.740
All right.

23:08.341 --> 23:12.287
And this is just, you know, bandoliers, Iraqi bandoliers.

23:12.387 --> 23:12.888
There's a number.

23:12.908 --> 23:14.430
I think that's the number five in Arabic.

23:14.450 --> 23:14.911
I'm not sure.

23:16.413 --> 23:16.874
H harness.

23:18.116 --> 23:24.405
This is what they wear on their back, and they can, you know, carry their ammo around in it.

23:24.385 --> 23:44.183
stuff like this that's kind of how it goes like that and then this is just a backpack some sort and has somebody's name on it there a couple guys got scratched off I don't know what that means but you know this is all Iraqi gear this is just stuff we got off the POWs you know here's some cigarettes

23:44.399 --> 23:45.201
Yeah, show those.

23:45.241 --> 23:47.385
Those are Iraqi cigarettes?

23:47.405 --> 23:48.087
Iraqi cigarettes.

23:48.147 --> 23:51.274
Or, you know, Arabic in the Arab world, I'm not sure.

23:51.354 --> 23:55.603
But it's funny because on the back here it says Virginia blended tobacco.

23:56.385 --> 23:57.908
But this is what they were all smoking.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.738
But we were helping them calm the nerves.

24:02.778 --> 24:03.319
Yeah, I guess.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.023
And then this is a tank manual.

24:05.003 --> 24:07.391
for a T-55 tank, that one I got off.

24:07.411 --> 24:12.106
It's all in Arabic, you know, just sitting there inside of the case.

24:12.126 --> 24:16.701
And then I asked an Iraqi, I had him over there and asked him what this was, you know, that Ali.

24:17.137 --> 24:18.500
Yeah, sort of hold it there.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.442
There you go.

24:19.782 --> 24:24.091
You know, I saw the planes on it, and then I turned around, and I saw this on it, and I was like, hey, what is this?

24:24.172 --> 24:30.565
And he opened it up, and he was looking at it, and he was reading it to himself, and then he goes, oh, this is directions to a party.

24:30.966 --> 24:37.018
Somebody was having a party, and this was directions to it, and I thought it was maybe something neat, but just somebody was having an officer's party, and...

24:36.998 --> 24:38.079
That was the invitation.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.881
I got that at the Kuwait airport, actually.

24:39.941 --> 24:41.122
We liberated the Kuwait airport.

24:41.142 --> 24:45.767
That's where we went in, Delbo, Kuwait, and went into the airport, and that's where I got most of the stuff, actually.

24:46.028 --> 24:46.688
I see.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.130
I see.

24:48.150 --> 24:55.658
You told me earlier that your training in Hawaii really was what sort of told you a whole lot about what the Marine Corps was all about.

24:55.678 --> 25:06.229
And then six weeks later, after the conflict was over, after the Persian Gulf War was over, what in your mind are the Marines all about, other than I know you're proud to be one?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.183
Yeah, it is different.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.225
It's a very small branch.

25:10.625 --> 25:17.234
You know, the Army has, you know, what, 800,000 strong, Navy probably about 800,000 strong, and Marine Corps is right around 200,000.

25:17.535 --> 25:19.898
I think the Air Force is probably 400,000 to 500,000.

25:20.900 --> 25:21.861
That's the numbers when I was in.

25:21.881 --> 25:22.602
It was close to that.

25:23.563 --> 25:29.872
And they're very small as far as, you know, how many officers they have per enlisted.

25:29.892 --> 25:32.115
So they're not officer top heavy.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.398
And they're more about light infantry.

25:34.439 --> 25:36.582
They're more about that's what they are.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.386
Not a whole lot of mechanized infantry in the Marine Corps.

25:39.406 --> 25:43.853
They have it, but it's not as big as the Army, the 3rd ID and all those guys, and it's huge.

25:44.794 --> 25:50.503
And it's just a different mentality, and I'm not taking anything away from any of the services because they're all great.

25:50.763 --> 25:55.710
Our services are the best in the world, but the Marine Corps does have a different mentality, and it's hard to explain.

25:55.791 --> 25:57.994
It's like Aggieland.

25:58.214 --> 25:58.855
You can't explain it.

25:58.875 --> 25:59.436
You just have to be...

25:59.416 --> 26:01.098
Same thing with the Marine Corps.

26:01.118 --> 26:02.499
It's just a lot of history.

26:02.519 --> 26:06.143
They really, when we went to boot camp, the history is very big to them.

26:06.163 --> 26:08.325
And they do really drill the history into you.

26:08.345 --> 26:17.875
And, you know, it's like they say, when you become one, it's like somebody opened up your chest and they take that eagle wheel of an anchor, which is that, you know, our emblem, and they tattoo it right on your heart.

26:17.915 --> 26:18.716
And that's the way you feel.

26:18.896 --> 26:19.857
I mean, that's the way you really feel.

26:19.897 --> 26:23.701
It's just a spirit of corps, you know, simplified LSS.

26:23.741 --> 26:25.643
And it really means something to them.

26:25.741 --> 26:26.542
And me.

26:27.464 --> 26:27.844
You bet.

26:28.565 --> 26:29.246
As well it should.

26:29.427 --> 26:33.393
After President Bush declared the ceasefire, you had to hang around for about three more weeks.

26:33.413 --> 26:33.693
Oh, yeah.

26:33.713 --> 26:34.855
Over there before you got to come home.

26:34.995 --> 26:35.196
Right.

26:35.216 --> 26:43.328
As I say, we were coming back down the road, you know, and they called a ceasefire, and we're watching all the Red A. There's guys out there capping those wells and everything.

26:43.308 --> 27:11.880
we come back and we're sitting there waiting to go home and then as you see the guys who were there the longest got to go home first and that's how it should work and so we remember we got there in country just two days before it started so we're sitting there and sitting there and sitting there and then you know as it goes by you know marines look for things to do i mean at one point they had a full contact you know um football game going until somebody broke a finger and somebody's ear got halfway tore off and they colonel said no no more of that then they had a smoker match you know the boxing matches and then

27:12.282 --> 27:14.446
He halted that, and they were just looking for things to do.

27:15.448 --> 27:20.839
And the food got to be where it was three meals a day of either veal or a hot dog, and maybe some corn or whatever.

27:20.859 --> 27:25.768
They just, basically all supplies had been taken away, and it was just limited stuff there.

27:26.204 --> 27:28.126
And finally we got to get on the plane.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.387
It was a TWA plane.

27:29.407 --> 27:30.529
Right.

27:30.549 --> 27:33.131
Which is kind of funny because, you know, it's always talking about, you know, no weapons on a plane.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.917
And we are putting in overhead storage, putting M-16s and M-60s and all that other stuff.

27:39.498 --> 27:42.742
There's a whole lot more to the story of you coming home and the long, long trip to Hawaii.

27:42.842 --> 27:44.143
But unfortunately we're out of town.

27:44.604 --> 27:45.685
There's so much more to tell.

27:45.745 --> 27:50.490
But first off and most important is thank you for your service, Randy, and thank you for being here.

27:50.470 --> 27:51.131
Thank you.

27:51.171 --> 27:51.993
Thank you for what you're doing.

27:52.013 --> 27:52.614
I think it's great.

27:52.855 --> 27:54.779
Thank you, Randy South.

27:54.799 --> 28:00.291
Operation Desert Storm lasted just six weeks at a cost of 148 servicemen and women's lives.

28:01.032 --> 28:08.648
So perhaps it will be little noted in our grandchildren's history books lost somewhere between Vietnam and 9-11.

28:09.303 --> 28:16.919
Nonetheless, more than a half million United States troops risked their lives that winter more than 14 years ago, and we salute them all.

28:16.939 --> 28:18.683
Please thank Yvette today.

28:19.144 --> 28:21.349
For Randy South, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:21.409 --> 28:24.375
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
