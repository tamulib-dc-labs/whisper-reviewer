00:00.031 --> 00:23.541
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.043
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:26.153 --> 00:35.462
Colonel Bob Wilkinson caught the end of the Korean War and then three tours of Vietnam, flying both fixed-wing and choppers as a United States Marine.

00:35.482 --> 00:42.870
But some of his most memorable stories come from the 32 weeks that he served as a helicopter pilot for President and Mrs. Dwight Eisenhower.

00:43.451 --> 00:49.657
In those 32 weeks, he was shuttling them, mostly from the White House to the retreat, named after their grandson.

00:49.677 --> 00:50.878
That was Camp David.

00:51.027 --> 00:54.651
His is a fascinating 28-year career of military service.

00:55.052 --> 00:58.816
And we welcome Bobby Wilkinson of Bryan to Veterans of the Valley.

00:58.836 --> 01:04.823
You were actually three years, I know, flying former President Eisenhower, but 32 weeks at Camp David.

01:04.983 --> 01:07.286
And we're going to talk about that a little bit later on, but let's go.

01:08.688 --> 01:14.014
Bob, early in your career, 1949, you actually got into the service right out of high school.

01:14.281 --> 01:16.525
And sort of tell us what happened right then.

01:16.565 --> 01:19.670
You almost got fired real quick from the Marine Corps, right?

01:20.451 --> 01:27.383
Well, went into the service right out of high school, went to boot camp, and then from boot camp straight to flight training.

01:27.403 --> 01:35.556
I was in flight training and just finished pre-flight instruction at Pensacola, Florida.

01:36.377 --> 01:41.065
And on a Friday afternoon, they called us into the gymnasium and told us that

01:41.534 --> 01:45.578
due to the shortage of funds, we're going to wash three fourths of you out.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.802
Sunday morning, the Korean War broke out.

01:50.822 --> 01:56.327
So Monday morning before breakfast, they called us all back in and said, forget that lecture, get back to work.

01:56.968 --> 01:57.468
Exactly.

01:57.929 --> 02:04.575
A lot of people don't know it, but when Korea broke out, a lot of the troops, the funds had been depleted still from World War II.

02:04.635 --> 02:10.140
There wasn't a lot left as far as being able to fight that war, but then it got back.

02:10.160 --> 02:10.360
So

02:10.559 --> 02:12.181
Talk about what happened after that day.

02:12.201 --> 02:14.644
You got real busy and eventually you did serve in Korea.

02:15.145 --> 02:16.086
Yes.

02:16.106 --> 02:26.198
That day I went through basic flight training at Pensacola and then advanced Corpus Christi and was ordered to Cherry Point, North Carolina.

02:26.218 --> 02:34.288
And they pulled two brand new second lieutenants and decided they want to send us through night fighter training, all weather fighter training.

02:34.328 --> 02:38.153
And it took me a little longer to get through that training than a regular training.

02:38.825 --> 02:47.113
And I didn't get to Korea until right at the end of the Korean War, but I served a complete tour in Korea of 15 months.

02:47.133 --> 02:51.878
1953, I think you said you went to Korea, so four years after you had enlisted.

02:52.479 --> 02:56.943
Talk about the planes that you flew, the fixed plane planes.

02:56.963 --> 03:05.372
Well, first, in Cherry Point, I was checked out in the F-7F, which was a

03:05.926 --> 03:15.039
Hangover, you might say, from World War II, it was used as night interdictory with rockets, bombs, and napalms, and was very good in that capacity.

03:16.121 --> 03:24.313
And we used that to intercept trucks, and the other transportation north of Vietnam was they had brought down supplies at night.

03:25.374 --> 03:34.988
Also, we trained during that time in a fighter intercept in the first night fighter that was jet in the Marine Corps, the F3D.

03:36.132 --> 03:46.703
We used that to escort the B-29s because we had about four and a half hours of fuel and could stay airborne quite a time.

03:46.723 --> 03:47.964
How long was your Korean tour?

03:49.065 --> 03:49.966
15 months.

03:50.046 --> 03:50.667
15 months.

03:51.167 --> 03:59.335
And talk a little bit about what the job, you described a little bit about what the job was, but sort of talk a little bit about those 15 months.

03:59.355 --> 04:02.038
I guess there were some pretty interesting times in the air.

04:02.288 --> 04:03.189
Yes, there was.

04:03.349 --> 04:09.916
As a young pilot, you gotta experience faster or the consequences.

04:10.317 --> 04:16.604
The night interdictory work was a little hairy, especially when the weather got bad.

04:16.664 --> 04:21.609
And the weather was bad over there in the summertime because you'd get the monsoons.

04:21.630 --> 04:25.934
And the jet flying was a little better.

04:25.994 --> 04:31.080
You could get up on top most of the time and fly around up there.

04:31.482 --> 04:51.187
The only time we had any action with the jets was on moonlit nights when the MiGs would come down, and we were slower in the MiGs, but once we'd start turning, the MiGs didn't seem to have any radar, and we could be on their tail pretty fast, so they'd usually get out of that area.

04:52.068 --> 04:53.490
The squadron was a pretty

04:54.365 --> 04:59.435
high morale squadron because there were five people in the squadron that had MIG kills.

05:00.637 --> 05:03.803
And it was a good bunch of people.

05:04.585 --> 05:10.877
The only thing is only two of us young lieutenants, all the rest were World War II vets.

05:11.058 --> 05:15.867
And they kind of watched what missions they put us on and kind of

05:16.319 --> 05:20.085
really shepherd us around to make sure we didn't get in harm's way.

05:20.326 --> 05:20.706
I see.

05:21.267 --> 05:22.108
Which you appreciated.

05:22.770 --> 05:23.150
I did.

05:23.811 --> 05:25.935
And the training was very good.

05:25.955 --> 05:33.868
Your tour of Korea done, you really had a whole separate career between Korea and your first tour of Vietnam.

05:33.888 --> 05:34.849
Sort of take us from there.

05:34.869 --> 05:38.335
You eventually came back to Texas B-Ville as an instructor, right?

05:38.355 --> 05:41.500
Yes, I ordered back to B-Ville as a

05:41.902 --> 05:44.526
instructor for three years in advanced training command.

05:45.107 --> 05:55.762
Upon completion of that, the Marine Corps decided to send 60% of the aviators into helicopters because that was the coming thing.

05:55.782 --> 06:01.670
And I received orders to Pensacola and retrained in helicopters and reported to the West Coast.

06:01.690 --> 06:10.963
And I'd been on the West Coast about a year and I was on maneuvers in the Philippines and all of a sudden I get orders to report to Washington, D.C.

06:11.905 --> 06:26.785
And immediately, and also during my time and route, I was supposed to work up so I could get clearance for a White House clearance.

06:26.885 --> 06:28.607
So I knew that something was up.

06:28.627 --> 06:35.216
And we'd heard rumors that they were going to start a program to fly the president by helicopters.

06:35.296 --> 06:40.663
And that's when I reported into Quantico, which is where we were based at.

06:41.048 --> 06:42.810
and we'd fly from there up the river.

06:43.672 --> 06:47.356
Ike had a very strict schedule.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.043
You could set your watch on his timing.

06:53.284 --> 06:56.509
We would go in to pick him up.

06:56.529 --> 07:03.478
If we had a set time to pick him up at the White House, we could be 21 seconds early or three seconds late.

07:04.522 --> 07:07.225
And he had heard that real well.

07:07.365 --> 07:22.660
And on the first 32 weekends that I was at Quantico, I would go up on a Friday afternoon, pick the President and Miz and Eisenhower up on a Friday and take them up to Camp David and stay up there for the weekend.

07:23.280 --> 07:31.008
They were always scheduled to fly back on a Sunday afternoon, but it would never happen.

07:31.028 --> 07:31.288
Right.

07:32.062 --> 07:36.689
Mamie didn't like to fly, but she'd fly to get out of Washington.

07:36.709 --> 07:54.998
But when it come time for her to return to Washington, usually on a Sunday afternoon she would call us and apologize to the fact that she was going to stay over until Monday morning and the President would too, and we were flying back at 7 o'clock.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.090
in the morning on Monday morning.

07:58.190 --> 08:02.955
And then she would always invite us down to have dinner with her and the president.

08:03.115 --> 08:03.936
Right.

08:03.956 --> 08:08.840
And the cabin they live down at Camp David, which was called Aspen.

08:08.860 --> 08:09.221
Yes, sir.

08:10.222 --> 08:11.983
And very nice meal.

08:12.004 --> 08:15.867
And we all always had all 15 members of our crews.

08:15.887 --> 08:17.629
We had five helicopters up there.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.452
And after the dinner.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.816
They would make sure we stayed for the movie.

08:26.416 --> 08:34.927
Hollywood knew that Eisenhower enjoyed Western movies, so they flew the latest Western movies out to him, right?

08:34.947 --> 08:49.927
And we had a big L-shaped room off the dining room, and at the back of the room was three couches and a table and a 35-millimeter projector on top of it.

08:49.947 --> 08:53.491
And out in the middle of the room, there would be one chair, one chair only.

08:53.511 --> 08:55.193
That's where Ike sat.

08:55.394 --> 08:55.714
Yes, sir.

08:56.318 --> 08:59.101
And at the other end was a pull-down screen.

08:59.262 --> 09:00.803
So we'd get up from the table.

09:00.863 --> 09:13.258
And when we got up from the dining room table, Mamie would make sure she had grabbed one of us by one arm and one by the other and set us down on the couch so she'd have a person on each side to talk to.

09:14.079 --> 09:16.682
And during the movie, she didn't ever watch the movie at all.

09:16.763 --> 09:17.924
She'd be talking.

09:17.944 --> 09:24.672
And every once in a while, it usually happened about three times during the movie, the president would turn over his shoulder and say, Mamie,

09:24.938 --> 09:28.567
Hush, I can't hear the movie.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.292
Just like regular folks, right?

09:30.312 --> 09:31.435
Just like regular folks.

09:31.595 --> 09:35.004
And that happened for the 32 straight weekends.

09:35.024 --> 09:37.771
And to be honest with you, I've never seen the same movie twice.

09:37.851 --> 09:38.593
There's always...

09:39.502 --> 09:42.647
And these were back in the days when they didn't have videos and things like that.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.612
16 millimeter projectors set up in the middle of the room.

09:45.632 --> 09:46.754
35 millimeter.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.496
35 millimeter.

09:47.516 --> 09:47.696
Yes.

09:48.016 --> 09:50.120
That's right.

09:51.202 --> 09:55.529
Shouldn't be surprising that he was such a stickler for being on time and punctual.

09:55.569 --> 09:59.716
I mean, this was a general who had who had pulled off the Normandy invasion.

09:59.816 --> 10:03.703
So it's probably not surprising at all that a military man would be like that.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.186
On one occasion, I went in to pick him up.

10:07.206 --> 10:11.993
I was supposed to pick up his secretary of state, John Foster Dallas, who was crippled.

10:13.495 --> 10:24.350
And he come out right at 10 o'clock, got in the helicopter, and his secretary of state wasn't with him, and I was waiting before I lifted for him to come out.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.235
And I get word from the president, why haven't you lifted?

10:27.295 --> 10:31.781
And I sent word back down, well, your secretary of state was supposed to come.

10:31.801 --> 10:33.724
He says he knew he wanted to be here to lift.

10:34.227 --> 10:42.457
So about the time I left it, here comes Secretary of the State out of the back door and I had to send another helicopter back to pick him up.

10:42.477 --> 10:45.080
So he didn't play favorites when he meant to be on time.

10:45.381 --> 10:52.369
You told me the President Eisenhower was a nice gentleman, but you certainly didn't want to get on his wrong side if you worked for him, right?

10:52.449 --> 10:53.170
Well, that's right.

10:53.250 --> 10:59.678
He had a knack for chewing people out, but he never chewed people out in public.

11:00.772 --> 11:03.696
or around any ladies or the press.

11:03.716 --> 11:04.918
It was always in private.

11:05.018 --> 11:11.066
But the minute you got chewed out, he'd put his arm around you and wink at you and walk away.

11:11.326 --> 11:11.707
Right.

11:11.727 --> 11:16.974
Like you said, one time you sort of got a deflection of that when something involving his grandson, I guess, right?

11:17.154 --> 11:20.579
Well, yeah, we were supposed to pick his son up.

11:21.079 --> 11:24.484
We picked him up at the Burning Tree Golf Course.

11:25.358 --> 11:31.206
He was playing golf there, and we picked him up at the AEC helicopter pad.

11:31.226 --> 11:40.338
And we, a naval aide forgot to tell us to pick up his son at the White House, who had a bunch of papers.

11:41.260 --> 11:44.304
So when we got up to Camp David, he was a little irked.

11:44.965 --> 11:53.256
And he started chewing out the naval aide, and I got caught right in between him and the naval aide.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.709
But after he chewed out, then he'd wink at you, right?

11:55.810 --> 11:58.995
Yeah, he'd put your arm around you and wink at you and walk away.

11:59.355 --> 12:00.597
Now, I want you to tell another story.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.380
This is quite a humorous story.

12:02.861 --> 12:09.832
Besides going to Camp David, he also had a home, I think, which eventually was a retirement home for him up in Newport, Newport, Rhode Island.

12:09.852 --> 12:12.836
And you told a story one time involving cars.

12:12.856 --> 12:13.137
Yes.

12:13.277 --> 12:14.298
What happened with this?

12:15.721 --> 12:19.767
I was in the first group as they formed the presidential missions.

12:20.810 --> 12:27.537
So we kind of had to set up everything with the Secret Service, of course, in conjunction with the press secretary.

12:29.059 --> 12:40.992
And his first summer vacation in Rhode Island, Newport, Rhode Island, we kept our helicopters at Quonset Point, Rhode Island Naval Air Station.

12:41.833 --> 12:45.957
We had a nice place to keep them, and the security was good, but the flight line

12:47.017 --> 12:56.632
Uh, and they kept us, uh, we had boards, build it over to BOQ and enlisted quarters, but we had, there's a river between us and the flight line.

12:56.912 --> 13:06.207
So we had to go down about three miles, go over a bridge and get to our flight line if we were at the BOQ or vice versa.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.991
Well, we were always

13:09.207 --> 13:14.273
worried about being there on time because he was such a stickler for time.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.716
And the first day, we just barely made a couple of schedules.

13:17.736 --> 13:24.063
So we decided that night, the pilots that were there, that we would try to do something on our own.

13:24.083 --> 13:35.856
So we all pitched in 50 bucks and told one of the pilots to go in town buy a car so we could have transportation instead of relying on the station buses to do it.

13:37.034 --> 13:40.379
So this gentleman went into town.

13:40.399 --> 13:44.284
We told him, we didn't care how he looked, just as long as it was good transportation.

13:45.806 --> 13:47.308
Well, it was good transportation.

13:47.408 --> 13:50.032
It was a 1937 Pontiac Hearst.

13:51.955 --> 13:54.378
And run real good.

13:54.398 --> 13:58.223
But that went on for about two days until the press got a hold of it.

13:59.645 --> 14:06.535
The fact that the presidential pilots were driving around in a hearse.

14:06.852 --> 14:10.336
Quadrant commander come in and told us to get rid of that hearse.

14:10.356 --> 14:12.238
And I think eventually you said a car dealer.

14:12.258 --> 14:23.931
Yeah, the next morning we were in the BOQ mess having breakfast and a nice gentleman walked in dressed to kill and he had something in his hands.

14:23.971 --> 14:28.576
I didn't notice it until he put it down on the table in front of us and it was eight sets of keys.

14:29.737 --> 14:36.505
This gentleman owned a local Ford Motor Company and the Ford Motor Company in Detroit had given us

14:36.670 --> 14:40.336
eight Mercury's to drive while we were in Rhode Island.

14:40.416 --> 14:43.180
So you got out of the Hearst and you had some Mercury's.

14:43.201 --> 14:44.422
That Hearst done its job.

14:44.643 --> 14:45.264
That was good.

14:46.326 --> 14:52.956
We could spend a whole show just talking about your experiences with President and Mrs. Eisenhower, but we've got three tours of Vietnam to talk about.

14:52.996 --> 14:56.642
But before we do that, I want to go to some photographs that you've supplied us.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.846
These are photographs that hang in your home.

14:58.866 --> 15:01.530
And Brian, we can go to those, I believe.

15:01.932 --> 15:03.838
The first one is just about to come up.

15:04.259 --> 15:07.589
You can look right there and you can see this was the F7F, is that right?

15:07.609 --> 15:07.970
Yes, sure.

15:08.070 --> 15:08.913
That was the F7F.

15:08.973 --> 15:12.263
I flew at Cherry Point and a little bit in Korea.

15:13.340 --> 15:20.669
And again, that was sort of an offshoot of the plane F-4F, F-6F that had been used in World War II.

15:20.689 --> 15:22.852
Yes, manufactured by German aircraft.

15:22.992 --> 15:23.273
Right.

15:23.373 --> 15:27.739
And I think you said originally that was a single-seater, but then they put in a second seat, right?

15:27.759 --> 15:29.681
Second seat and put radar in the nose.

15:29.881 --> 15:33.806
I think it was originally built as a photo plane, as a single-seater.

15:33.826 --> 15:38.472
And it was very fast for a propeller-driven airplane.

15:38.492 --> 15:40.836
And you were trained in three different kinds of helicopters.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.997
Which one are we looking at there?

15:42.112 --> 15:43.574
We're looking at the H-34.

15:43.975 --> 15:50.704
That's the one that I was trained in primarily, and I flew the President in a plushed-up version of that.

15:50.724 --> 15:51.085
I see.

15:51.105 --> 15:52.827
So that would have been what Marine One would have been.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.369
Marine One at the time.

15:54.389 --> 15:54.970
That's right.

15:54.990 --> 15:58.295
But you also flew out 53s, 46s, and the Huey gunships.

15:58.315 --> 16:01.980
53, 46s, and the Huey gunships, and had a little time in the Cobra.

16:02.220 --> 16:03.081
I see.

16:03.101 --> 16:03.722
I see.

16:03.742 --> 16:05.284
Okay, we'll move on to the next picture.

16:05.685 --> 16:06.686
You're on the right.

16:06.706 --> 16:07.508
Tell us about this picture.

16:07.528 --> 16:09.570
Yes, that was up on my retirement.

16:09.591 --> 16:11.393
The gentleman to my left was

16:11.845 --> 16:13.467
Major General Vic Armstrong.

16:14.128 --> 16:18.195
At the time, I was a presidential pilot.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.480
He was the CEO of the squadron as a lieutenant colonel.

16:22.621 --> 16:27.449
He was very fluent in many foreign languages, also.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.812
And I believe we have another picture here, too.

16:31.074 --> 16:35.220
OK, yeah, this is your shadow box of your awards.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.402
Yes, sir.

16:36.685 --> 16:39.872
Without going through all of them, obviously, you were well decorated.

16:40.073 --> 16:41.957
In the middle, is that the Distinguished Flying Cross?

16:42.097 --> 16:42.718
Yes, sir, it is.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.324
When the Distinguished Flying Cross?

16:45.384 --> 16:52.821
I received that for actions in Vietnam, pulling a long-range recon team out from behind the Middle Islands.

16:53.797 --> 16:56.962
I know that's something you're very proud of, and that hangs on your wall, too.

16:56.982 --> 17:01.288
And thanks for loaning it out to us so we could show everybody else.

17:02.509 --> 17:07.877
Well, also, if we can, when we have a chance, we brought a picture here in the studio, as a matter of fact.

17:07.897 --> 17:10.000
And I'll straighten it out as I'm holding this.

17:10.020 --> 17:10.801
This was a drawing.

17:10.841 --> 17:15.147
I'm going to let you, obviously, the figure in the middle is former President Eisenhower.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.589
Talk about this drawing.

17:16.870 --> 17:21.897
Well, that drawing was made by one of our pilots, a gentleman by the name of Al Leahy.

17:22.366 --> 17:26.151
who'd become very famous as a combat artist later on in Vietnam.

17:27.252 --> 17:40.568
And it was given, the large drawing of that was given to President Eisner after he completed his round the world tour in 1959, 1960.

17:41.689 --> 17:45.934
And those are the several places that he visited.

17:45.954 --> 17:48.137
Now the signatures on the bottom, who is that?

17:48.370 --> 17:49.151
Al Lahey.

17:49.692 --> 17:51.795
Okay, but there's a lot of signatures down there.

17:51.815 --> 17:54.698
Oh, the signatures are all the pilots that were in the squadron.

17:54.719 --> 17:56.020
Okay, so your signature is one of those?

17:56.040 --> 17:56.301
Yes.

17:57.823 --> 18:06.695
At the time, that was about when the squadron was the largest, when I was in it, and we had 34 pilots.

18:06.835 --> 18:14.405
Now the presidential squadron has 85 pilots in it.

18:14.425 --> 18:14.705
Wow.

18:15.546 --> 18:16.468
So it has grown.

18:16.688 --> 18:17.449
It has grown.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.415
You had taken an initial tour of Vietnam and an advisory role, right?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.817
That was your first tour of Vietnam.

18:24.077 --> 18:26.239
Talk briefly about that and then just sort of take us through to you.

18:26.259 --> 18:43.538
Well, I was on a naval amphibious staff and we were an amphibious group primarily offshore in Vietnam, both of them by the DMC and then farther down south by Saigon.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.378
That was an interesting tour.

18:45.478 --> 18:46.460
We could see it coming.

18:46.821 --> 18:47.723
Right.

18:48.164 --> 18:51.712
But we couldn't do much about it until other things happened.

18:51.913 --> 18:52.694
Right.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.917
And that was in 1963.

18:54.097 --> 18:54.799
Right.

18:55.761 --> 19:01.354
And then 1965, I guess, when Vietnam was starting to get full blown, that was your second tour.

19:01.554 --> 19:02.877
That was my second tour.

19:03.616 --> 19:04.677
I was in a squadron.

19:04.697 --> 19:09.842
In fact, I was squadron commander of a helicopter squadron in Hawaii.

19:10.903 --> 19:20.192
And I was one of the first squadrons they sent to Vietnam and had my first tour over there at the time.

19:21.173 --> 19:23.295
Why don't you talk more about that tour?

19:24.036 --> 19:31.944
One of the ways that I got to know Colonel Wilkinson is that you're a member of an organization here in town called BSA, which stands for Ben Shot At.

19:32.344 --> 19:33.505
And these are veterans who

19:33.923 --> 19:37.308
quite simply have been shot at in warfare.

19:37.328 --> 19:43.317
And you sort of earned your membership into this group in that second tour of Vietnam initially.

19:43.377 --> 19:46.742
Some pretty, as you say, pretty hairy rides there, I guess.

19:46.842 --> 19:47.242
Yes, sir.

19:48.905 --> 19:57.938
I was one of the very few squadrons or few members of the squadrons that went over there that had combat experience from the Korean War.

19:58.098 --> 20:01.483
So they kind of looked for me as leadership and a

20:02.240 --> 20:15.217
I'd been there a short time, and a group commander called me and said, okay, you're going to lead the three and a half squadrons in the next day's operations, which was a pretty hairy one up in the Aishau Valley on the river.

20:15.377 --> 20:16.979
And we took quite a bit of fire.

20:17.960 --> 20:24.248
We really didn't get anybody, and our squadron hurt, but we were dropping out.

20:24.616 --> 20:49.510
south vietnamese troops and uh we had several wounded troops we had to go back in and pull out yes sir yes that was the first baptism in south vietnam with me right it was taking heavy fire right now you were a uh a commanding officer and you actually uh sort of jumped over some lieutenant colonels at the at the time when you were a commanding officer is that right yes sir

20:50.452 --> 20:50.973
Yes, sir.

20:50.993 --> 20:53.496
I had my first command as a major.

20:53.836 --> 20:54.177
I see.

20:54.637 --> 20:58.302
And we had quite a few lieutenant colonels that kind of looked at me.

20:58.662 --> 20:58.902
Right.

20:58.923 --> 21:06.772
But I was in the right place at the right time, and the commanding general said, you're it.

21:06.792 --> 21:10.217
And so I carried out my orders.

21:10.237 --> 21:12.359
You had gone back.

21:12.379 --> 21:18.687
One thing we passed over is actually before you went to Vietnam, I guess, for your second tour, you had gotten orders as a

21:19.173 --> 21:21.917
with the helicopter squadron in Hawaii, is that right?

21:22.378 --> 21:25.822
And then after your second tour, you had gone back to Hawaii, is that correct?

21:25.842 --> 21:26.904
Sort of take us from there.

21:27.285 --> 21:45.150
Well, when I was through my tour in 1965, I was ordered back to Hawaii and I spent three years back there and we reorganized a brigade and the first was the brigade G4 and then become the G3, the operations officer.

21:45.170 --> 21:48.775
And then upon completion of that three-year tour,

21:49.649 --> 21:52.313
went back to the West Coast for three months and retrained.

21:52.974 --> 21:59.024
And every helicopter I could get retrained in, so when I reported to Vietnam, I could get a squadron right away.

21:59.304 --> 21:59.564
Right.

21:59.845 --> 22:04.612
And I was trained in the 53, the 46, and the Huey.

22:04.672 --> 22:05.013
Exactly.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.317
So I ended up getting a Huey gunship squadron.

22:07.337 --> 22:08.258
Right.

22:09.280 --> 22:15.910
And I guess if I'm getting the chronology of this right, was your third tour of Vietnam that you were a...

22:16.160 --> 22:18.603
A commander of a maintenance squadron, is that right?

22:18.924 --> 22:23.970
The first three months, I was commander of an aircraft group maintenance squadron.

22:24.150 --> 22:24.871
Right.

22:24.891 --> 22:31.640
And then I was ordered to take over a gunship squadron for my last nine months.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.261
Exactly.

22:32.922 --> 22:36.026
And so that was a nine-month tour of something that's normally a six-month tour.

22:36.046 --> 22:40.812
Well, it's normally a six-month tour of squadron commander, and they kept me in there for nine months.

22:40.892 --> 22:41.513
I see.

22:41.533 --> 22:43.956
And this was all happening actually, what, south of the DMZ?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.969
Well, I was supposed to.

22:48.470 --> 22:52.517
My squadron had a particular mission that was called the Prairie Fire Mission.

22:52.617 --> 22:58.366
We had to furnish two helicopters, and they were the lead-in helicopters every day.

22:59.348 --> 23:04.316
So I had two crews constantly were on that mission.

23:04.336 --> 23:10.146
And it was a very hairy mission because we were putting long-range recon teams in.

23:10.852 --> 23:14.659
behind enemy lines over in Laos and North Vietnam.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.003
So we were getting shot up pretty often.

23:17.023 --> 23:23.013
And I got quite a few aircraft shot up, but only lost one crew or half of one crew.

23:23.153 --> 23:30.346
And the only way that the two out of the four survived was when they got hit so bad they hit in a river.

23:30.386 --> 23:34.513
They was on fire and they hit in a river and survived it because of that.

23:34.797 --> 23:37.761
You talked about people that were under your command.

23:37.781 --> 23:47.935
You had a couple of majors, a captain, some lieutenants, and it's very important that you talked to me with a lot of pride about how those people turned out and who they became.

23:48.215 --> 23:49.117
Yes, sir.

23:49.137 --> 23:49.798
Talk about that.

23:50.178 --> 23:59.250
When my last tour in Vietnam with that squadron, I had three majors, one captain, and the rest were lieutenants right out of flight school.

23:59.431 --> 23:59.691
Right.

24:00.194 --> 24:03.379
Three of these lieutenants made general officer.

24:03.699 --> 24:09.548
One of them made two-star, one made three, and one become assistant commandant of the Marine Corps as a four-star.

24:10.329 --> 24:12.192
And I was very proud of those young men.

24:13.254 --> 24:21.767
They were put under fire right away as young officers and come through very nicely there.

24:21.807 --> 24:22.708
And then later on,

24:23.363 --> 24:25.806
They continued their career and had a brilliant career.

24:26.187 --> 24:26.507
Right.

24:26.988 --> 24:40.645
And one of them who become assistant commandant had a story about because he called me aside one morning and said, something's wrong with me.

24:40.725 --> 24:43.168
I'm scared to death on that prairie fire mission.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.913
So I just looked him in the face about 45 seconds and didn't say a word.

24:46.933 --> 24:52.780
And then finally I said, Willie, so am I. And he was so happy somebody else was

24:53.215 --> 24:56.820
I thought he was going to jump across the desk and kiss me.

24:58.563 --> 25:02.769
He wasn't aware that other people were scared too.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.654
Even his leader felt the same way that he did.

25:05.874 --> 25:07.757
And you knew after that you were going to have no more problems.

25:07.837 --> 25:09.299
No problem with him.

25:11.082 --> 25:12.604
Exactly.

25:13.205 --> 25:15.949
Your tour of Vietnam over.

25:16.418 --> 25:19.381
We didn't talk about your education.

25:19.401 --> 25:22.744
You kind of got education when you could during your military career.

25:22.764 --> 25:30.911
You eventually got your initial degree at Chaminade when you were in Hawaii and then came to Texas A&M and did some work in accounting here.

25:31.071 --> 25:31.551
Is that right?

25:31.571 --> 25:33.012
Yeah, graduate work in accounting.

25:34.414 --> 25:40.459
But I basically got three years of my first college.

25:40.479 --> 25:46.324
I think I attended every college on both coasts to get different courses at night.

25:46.692 --> 25:54.821
to where I worked up to three years and the Marine Corps sent me the year and a half to complete my college education.

25:54.961 --> 26:01.769
And then at three and a half years, I was able to get a double major in both history and political science in the Far East.

26:02.110 --> 26:03.271
Right, right.

26:03.291 --> 26:07.676
And you opened up your own accounting company here and that's what you did for a living, right?

26:07.696 --> 26:08.237
Yes.

26:09.058 --> 26:12.902
After I retired in 77, I had a little accounting firm that I

26:13.523 --> 26:18.188
Most of my clients were professional men, doctors, dentists, and vets.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.951
You and your wife, Janet, she's a retired RN.

26:21.011 --> 26:21.551
I know that.

26:21.591 --> 26:26.737
And I know you have a family, daughters and grandchildren.

26:26.757 --> 26:30.040
And one of your grandchildren is serving in Iraq right now.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.403
We've got about just a few seconds left.

26:32.723 --> 26:33.985
I know you're very proud of that.

26:34.405 --> 26:36.007
Yes, I am.

26:36.027 --> 26:39.210
My oldest daughter is a professor at Mississippi State.

26:40.355 --> 26:43.760
And my youngest daughter's husband is a retired Army.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.265
And my grandson chose Marine Corps.

26:47.566 --> 26:48.627
And I'm proud of that.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.630
And he's now serving in Vietnam.

26:52.453 --> 26:53.635
Very proud of the family.

26:53.935 --> 26:54.576
I bet you are.

26:54.816 --> 26:55.618
And we're very proud of you.

26:56.078 --> 26:58.562
And I wish we had more time because we could talk a lot about it.

26:58.602 --> 26:59.864
Quite a fascinating career.

27:00.184 --> 27:02.548
Thank you, Bob Wilkinson, for being with us today.

27:02.568 --> 27:03.409
My privilege, sir.

27:03.609 --> 27:04.050
All right.

27:04.621 --> 27:07.866
Bob Wilkinson and his wife, Janet, have been married 53 years.

27:07.926 --> 27:10.609
They live in their deserved retirement in Bryan.

27:11.110 --> 27:14.415
He's a proud member of this local group we told you about, BSA.

27:14.455 --> 27:20.523
That stands for Ben Shot At, and he earned that description many times in Vietnam while defending our freedoms.

27:20.543 --> 27:24.369
We salute Colonel Bob Wilkinson for his service, as we salute all veterans.

27:25.090 --> 27:26.071
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:26.351 --> 27:28.975
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
