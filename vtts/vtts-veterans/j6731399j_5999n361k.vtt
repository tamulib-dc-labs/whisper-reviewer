00:12.552 --> 00:20.120
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:20.140 --> 00:28.929
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:28.949 --> 00:30.010
First National Bank.

00:30.030 --> 00:41.682
First, always.

00:42.573 --> 01:03.923
Welcome back and thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.780 --> 01:15.211
Little did he know that when he went out horseback riding on that sunny Sunday morning in the Trinity River bottom with an Aggie buddy in 1941 that when he returned the U.S.

01:15.231 --> 01:17.553
would be at war with Japan.

01:17.573 --> 01:20.096
Our guest today says he made a big circle.

01:20.556 --> 01:31.227
That's how he describes the events from his junior year at Texas A&M in 1941 until his return to the area that he describes as the best place I've ever lived.

01:31.207 --> 01:38.634
and began his teaching career in 1975 at Texas A&M, with stops in Australia and New Guinea along the way.

01:38.654 --> 01:46.161
Sit back with me and visit with this veteran of the Valley, Frank Litterst, Jr., 85 years young and sharp as a tack.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.042
Frank, you thank you very much for being here today.

01:48.283 --> 01:48.883
We appreciate it.

01:48.983 --> 01:49.804
It's my privilege.

01:49.844 --> 01:50.705
Thank you very much.

01:51.265 --> 01:58.632
And I just want to say first that if you thought you were getting an Audie Murphy, now you're mistaken because I was no hero.

01:58.848 --> 02:01.992
All of the veterans in our eyes are heroes in some way, shape, or form.

02:02.012 --> 02:05.017
If you served, you're definitely a hero in the eyes of everyone around here.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.318
Thank you, sir.

02:06.338 --> 02:13.128
Take us back to that Sunday that you went out horseback riding and you came back and basically your world was turned upside down.

02:14.069 --> 02:18.936
Well, I was in the Corps.

02:19.016 --> 02:25.345
I was the first sergeant at that time in my battery and thought I was important and

02:25.730 --> 02:55.298
So when I came out of there and found we were at war while we rushed back over and thought we'd be leaving the next week or so, but of course we weren't and we stayed through the next year and our senior year was changed from the fall of 42 to spring of 43 as normal and we had to go through the summer of 42 and the fall of 42

02:55.733 --> 03:04.242
and we got out Christmas time so that we'd get into the service early and that's the way we ended.

03:04.262 --> 03:20.560
We got real serious about the military end of it and just about forgot everything else but what was coming off in the war and it was a big deal to us and it was a big deal to everybody.

03:20.810 --> 03:21.311
Right.

03:21.331 --> 03:32.986
Now, your class of 43 basically had quite a distinction from all the other classes of any, and basically you were all taken into the military all at once in mass, so to speak.

03:33.006 --> 03:33.587
Yes, sir.

03:34.028 --> 03:46.024
A lot of us hung around here after the senior semester in the fall of 42, and we all accumulated around here in January of 43, and

03:46.527 --> 03:48.354
I think it was January 23rd.

03:48.555 --> 03:56.706
I got on the train or bus or something, and we went to our respective, whatever we were, artillery, infantry, and so forth.

03:57.142 --> 04:03.390
I went to Camp Davis, North Carolina for anti-aircraft artillery OCS for 13 weeks.

04:03.550 --> 04:11.499
And then we got commissioned at the end of that period, which was May 6 for me.

04:12.240 --> 04:12.681
Okay.

04:12.701 --> 04:15.604
And just a couple of days later, after May 6?

04:15.624 --> 04:18.828
May 6, 43, I got commissioned.

04:18.868 --> 04:20.591
May the 8th, I got married.

04:20.611 --> 04:25.917
And we had a wonderful marriage, 59 years.

04:26.842 --> 04:56.477
and lost her, passed away in 2002, recently, and we got married, had a short honeymoon, and part of it was going to Galveston and blackout, and then the other part of it, we had some days left, came back up here and stayed in the old hotel down in Bryan, and came back here and saw some of the guys that hadn't left,

04:57.368 --> 05:06.518
Then we headed for Camp Stewart, Georgia and stayed there through the summer until August 7th and went overseas.

05:06.818 --> 05:12.984
Now, I understand you were in the Army, but you actually had a fervent love for planes.

05:13.004 --> 05:14.906
You really wanted to be in the Air Corps.

05:14.926 --> 05:16.868
I wanted to be a flyboy, a pilot.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.730
It looked so glamorous.

05:18.750 --> 05:25.958
And when I got to Georgia and had the bad luck of being in our

05:26.528 --> 05:30.418
in a riot there at the base that was pretty bad.

05:30.658 --> 05:37.235
And after I got thinking about it a while, I said, I think I'll see if I can't get up in the air.

05:37.255 --> 05:40.403
And I went over, took an air cold physical and passed it.

05:41.058 --> 05:47.204
and then got back to my battalion headquarters and they said, it's too late, you can't, we're frozen, we got to go overseas.

05:47.304 --> 05:54.271
So after about two and a half months there, three, we left and started headed overseas.

05:55.192 --> 05:56.093
Tell us about that trip.

05:56.453 --> 05:59.556
Basically, I believe you left out of Sacramento, California or somewhere around?

05:59.576 --> 06:07.784
Well, yeah, we took a train from Georgia to Camp Stoneman, California, which was on the Sacramento River, I think.

06:07.804 --> 06:10.407
And you would...

06:12.614 --> 06:14.717
prepare yourself there to go overseas.

06:14.757 --> 06:20.564
They issued you your ordnance, rifles, everything, and got you in the right frame of mind, supposedly.

06:22.105 --> 06:34.280
Aggie friend of mine and I made a mistake of leaving that base and visited a friend of mine, an Aggie Class 42, Maury Curtis, over in the Marine pre-flight.

06:35.221 --> 06:39.887
And when we got back, why, we were almost missed the boat because they were all lined up in their

06:40.323 --> 06:49.337
battle dressed and ready to leave, go down and what you do is march down to a riverboat, get on it on the river, then go down it to Oakland.

06:50.680 --> 07:06.465
And luckily somebody packed our stuff for us and I jumped into my old clothes real quick and we went down the river and by that time it was dark and we climbed aboard a Dutch freighter that was supposed to carry us overseas.

07:06.884 --> 07:10.028
And that evening, and it was, of course, exciting to us.

07:10.089 --> 07:11.831
We had no idea where we were going to go.

07:11.971 --> 07:18.641
And the next morning, we sailed out onto the Golden Gate Bridge and headed west.

07:19.582 --> 07:21.305
It was a long trip, wasn't it?

07:22.627 --> 07:23.648
It was real long.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.934
I went over a little bit earlier than a lot of my classmates.

07:28.214 --> 07:31.359
And submarines were bad.

07:31.399 --> 07:33.482
We had a blimp that went out over us.

07:34.070 --> 07:52.674
could spot them, you know, so far out and then he turned around and left us and we picked up a destroyer escort and we went way down below Christmas Island and then over towards all the New Zealand, Australia area and it took about 27, 28 days.

07:53.515 --> 08:00.904
We zigzagged the whole way to keep getting hit by torpedoes and I remember

08:01.171 --> 08:09.622
It was especially bad because there was no fresh water to bathe in, but to bathe in salt water, and that got pretty raw after a while, you know.

08:09.803 --> 08:11.465
Did you run into any storms along the way?

08:11.905 --> 08:13.427
Not that time, no.

08:13.548 --> 08:18.775
My next trip I did on a boat when I went to New Guinea, but not the Australian trip, yeah.

08:19.636 --> 08:23.621
Australian trip, we landed in Brisbane, Australia, which was a very nice place.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.104
Tell us a little bit about your stay in Australia.

08:26.124 --> 08:28.107
You weren't there that long, really, were you?

08:29.167 --> 08:39.701
We stayed in Brisbane about two, three weeks, bivouacked in a racetrack, Ascot Towns, and everybody over in Australia had a racehorse at that time.

08:39.761 --> 08:42.385
It seemed like we have a dog or a pet.

08:44.127 --> 08:45.349
They were fanatics about it.

08:45.509 --> 08:53.320
Anyway, we took over their racetrack, and they put us on a little train, a little narrow-gauge thing, and no sides, cinders blowing in and everything.

08:53.360 --> 08:58.667
We rode 800 miles north to Townsville, Australia.

09:00.250 --> 09:09.700
We bivouacked out in the boondocks outside of Townsville and stayed there about maybe three months.

09:11.302 --> 09:14.745
And didn't have a bad time there.

09:15.086 --> 09:23.635
And we walked miles and miles and miles in training and so forth, just getting toughed up for going up to New Guinea.

09:23.655 --> 09:28.620
And that's where I had that accident that

09:29.275 --> 09:32.459
I'll mention to you, we had a good baseball team.

09:32.479 --> 09:33.720
You want me to tell you about that?

09:33.740 --> 09:34.561
Oh, absolutely.

09:34.581 --> 09:37.865
We had a good, awesome baseball team, and we beat everybody.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.307
And I had a boxing team that was good, too.

09:40.427 --> 09:50.078
And I got hit by an inside curveball in my left elbow here, and it looked just like a horse's hawk.

09:50.098 --> 09:52.381
It just got real big, a hematoma.

09:53.282 --> 09:58.928
So they took me to the hospital in Townsville, which was a bunch of houses they'd

09:59.093 --> 10:02.538
confiscated from people, and each house was a ward.

10:02.558 --> 10:13.375
Well, we had an officer's ward, and I was laying out in the front porch, you know, and this big guy comes down the street with a very big hat on, you know, western hat, looking girls with him.

10:14.136 --> 10:20.065
If he got closer, we could see it was old John Wayne, and he wasn't going to come see us because we were officers.

10:20.185 --> 10:26.755
It just won't hang with the listed men, so we started moaning and groaning and carrying on up our head.

10:27.005 --> 10:33.595
And he started laughing and he came up there and visited with us, put his old hat on my head and everything, you know.

10:33.655 --> 10:35.098
He was a wonderful man.

10:35.198 --> 10:36.680
I wish we had more like him.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.484
Did he ask you anything about your war wound, so to speak?

10:39.785 --> 10:42.209
Oh, I covered it.

10:42.269 --> 10:49.620
I told him I was machine gun or something, you know, hit by a baseball.

10:51.271 --> 10:55.696
What, after you were in, I also understand the Australians also had some pretty good, like, 14% gear.

10:55.716 --> 10:57.478
Australia is a nice country.

10:57.538 --> 11:04.346
I took another Air Corps physical there, and they said I couldn't go home and grade and take flight training.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.289
Maybe they were getting enough pilots.

11:06.349 --> 11:06.629
I don't know.

11:06.649 --> 11:10.373
It was kind of expensive to take me from there all the way back to flight training.

11:10.413 --> 11:16.140
So I was turned down again, and it probably was a good, maybe saved my life.

11:16.320 --> 11:20.265
But eventually we...

11:22.034 --> 11:23.235
they got my battalion.

11:23.255 --> 11:36.186
We were an unattached battalion of anti-aircraft artillery weapons, and they had us load a Liberty ship up with 500-pound bombs to go up to New Guinea to Port Moresby.

11:36.206 --> 11:40.410
After we loaded it, well, they said, well, you get your stuff together and get on the ship.

11:40.450 --> 11:46.135
You're going to ride on top of these bombs up there, which we did, about 800 of us.

11:48.036 --> 11:51.079
And then about midway to Guinea while we hit a

11:51.667 --> 12:14.080
a tarnate uh typhoon what we call a hurricane yeah typhoon and it was it was awful storm and they i was sleeping on the deck on the cot that old cot would hit one railing and come back and hit the side of the ship you know and it was a rough night and my blanket blew overseas over over the board rather and i

12:14.785 --> 12:19.670
Got all soaking wet, and I came in and got in bed with Aggie named Earl Winchy.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.592
That's the Winchy family from Spring, Texas.

12:22.873 --> 12:23.994
Yeah, he was from Spring.

12:24.014 --> 12:25.015
He didn't like it much.

12:25.115 --> 12:28.758
Earl passed away a couple years ago, but he was a dancer.

12:28.778 --> 12:30.600
He put up with me until the next day.

12:31.341 --> 12:34.184
Eventually, we got to Milne Bay, New Guinea.

12:34.204 --> 12:35.825
It was my first stop up there.

12:36.686 --> 12:39.128
Stayed there a good while.

12:39.589 --> 12:44.033
Set our automatic weapons, our 40 millimeters around the harbor there.

12:44.688 --> 12:55.946
And we didn't have much to do because the 5th Air Force had gotten the Japanese pretty subdued as far as the air raids and so forth.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.430
So we pretty much had air superiority at that time.

12:58.450 --> 12:59.431
We had it, yeah.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.915
That was a great Air Force, the 5th Air Force.

13:02.035 --> 13:06.342
And they invented everything, skip bombing.

13:06.693 --> 13:34.050
took planes and made additions to them, and it was a great outfit, and they got the job done, and we didn't have much to do, except, I don't know, they used to, he thought I was Artie Murphy, I guess, he used to send me and about a dozen men up in the mountains there, the only standing mountain range, which was behind our gun emplacements, it'd take two days to go up, and

13:35.161 --> 13:45.764
We'd stay up there in jungle hammocks, supposedly looking for stray Japanese that had been left there after the Battle of Buna Mission, which was up above us.

13:45.784 --> 13:46.906
Did you ever encounter anything?

13:47.147 --> 13:50.554
They were hungry, and I just...

13:50.973 --> 13:54.637
Thank the Lord to this day, we didn't run into any of them.

13:55.738 --> 13:57.920
I'd have beat them all down that mountainside.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.302
So you basically came back all the time.

13:59.322 --> 14:00.203
I'd have been a real hero.

14:00.583 --> 14:04.467
About my third mission up there, I fell and got hurt.

14:04.787 --> 14:06.249
I fell down the mountain.

14:08.071 --> 14:18.702
But I got back down and eventually decided I wanted to get closer to the ground action.

14:19.424 --> 14:30.534
I transferred to a 155-millimeter artillery outfit combination of seacoast and field artillery up above Finch Avenue, New Guinea on the coast.

14:30.554 --> 14:35.318
Those are the big guns, the 155-millimeter, I think long toms or something.

14:35.338 --> 14:36.339
Long toms, yes sir.

14:36.359 --> 14:38.961
The projectile weighed about 90 pounds.

14:40.762 --> 14:48.469
We were across from New Britain and we hung out up there.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.574
just more New Guinea.

14:51.634 --> 14:53.416
There wasn't much change anywhere.

14:53.436 --> 14:59.862
It was a place that was uninhabited and a lot of the people up in the mountains were up in there were still eating each other.

14:59.962 --> 15:04.507
No cities, no towns, no nothing.

15:07.730 --> 15:13.335
It was a strange vacation.

15:14.316 --> 15:15.317
The Australians

15:15.972 --> 15:16.793
came up there.

15:16.813 --> 15:24.163
The Australian 7th Division was one of them that had come home from Africa, and they sent them up there, and they were just wonderful.

15:24.724 --> 15:30.011
They could fight like all get out, and they handled the groundwork real well.

15:30.071 --> 15:32.374
We were pretty safe.

15:34.357 --> 15:37.521
You get long toms, you can get way back away from somebody.

15:37.781 --> 15:40.725
You can reach way out there, can't you?

15:40.745 --> 15:43.189
Yeah, all it does is it hurts your ears.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.490
I can imagine.

15:44.530 --> 15:45.051
Yeah, we...

15:45.233 --> 15:54.762
I'm glad they didn't depend on us too much because I remember one day we were firing at a toad target for practice out in the water and that ship followed.

15:55.403 --> 15:58.606
And we got close to that ship, he cut target loose.

15:58.666 --> 16:05.252
That was Earl Winchy back there telling me what to set in the guns.

16:05.272 --> 16:11.659
And anyway, it was pretty routine up there after that.

16:11.859 --> 16:15.122
I think I...

16:15.845 --> 16:21.291
They decided I need to come home and get my knee operated on my left knee for my fall.

16:21.391 --> 16:23.733
And then I got dengue fever.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.019
Well, but before you go to that, we've got some pictures that you supplied us.

16:29.039 --> 16:36.026
Let's let them load the pictures up and we'll look up here at the monitor and you can kind of just give us a quick little synopsis of each picture.

16:36.386 --> 16:37.067
There's the first one.

16:37.087 --> 16:40.190
Those pictures were all in Melbourne, New Guinea.

16:40.210 --> 16:44.535
We were right on the water and our gun politicians were too.

16:45.089 --> 16:53.780
The fellow on the left's name was Moon, and the second was Oscar Steinberg and myself, and I can't remember that man on the right.

16:54.200 --> 17:00.228
Old Oscar was from Los Angeles, a real nice fellow, and he couldn't swim.

17:01.229 --> 17:05.834
One day, he stepped off into a hole out there in Middle Bay.

17:05.854 --> 17:12.042
He was trying to enjoy the water, and he went out of sight, and I had to go pull him out of the ocean.

17:12.595 --> 17:15.839
And then I pulled another guy out, too, was trying to swim home.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.382
He had gone out of his head.

17:19.443 --> 17:21.366
Tell us a little bit about this picture.

17:21.386 --> 17:28.254
This picture is, that's at that campstone we're getting ready to go get in the riverboat.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.936
That's me on the right, I think.

17:29.956 --> 17:33.040
On the far right with that helmet cocked that certain way there?

17:33.400 --> 17:33.641
Sir.

17:33.981 --> 17:34.942
With the helmet?

17:34.962 --> 17:35.923
The helmet cocked.

17:35.983 --> 17:38.406
I thought I was something else.

17:38.426 --> 17:41.370
So we were, I just barely made the ship and

17:41.857 --> 17:43.920
The guy in the middle had packed my stuff.

17:44.401 --> 17:47.866
Names I can't remember because that was a long time ago.

17:48.747 --> 17:50.369
And that's me in New Guinea.

17:51.872 --> 17:56.018
Kind of a pensive mood, wishing I was back home to see my bride.

17:57.460 --> 18:01.405
I had a skin place on my nose.

18:02.727 --> 18:04.590
I used to try to box a lot.

18:05.431 --> 18:09.495
I had my head pretty skinned up there in that picture.

18:09.515 --> 18:11.396
But you had a good boxing team too, I'm sure.

18:11.416 --> 18:12.277
Yeah, great.

18:13.518 --> 18:18.382
And that's Captain Moon and myself outside our tent.

18:18.402 --> 18:20.164
So here we're still in Milne Bay.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.927
Yeah, it rained every day there, 140-something inches a year.

18:25.068 --> 18:28.611
And everything Bill did was nasty.

18:28.631 --> 18:33.936
But really compared to lots of kids, I didn't have it bad at all.

18:34.692 --> 18:38.397
I traded cigarettes for that grass skirt.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.967
She went off in a cloud of smoke and no skirt on me.

18:44.987 --> 18:46.850
But they were happy.

18:46.890 --> 18:48.091
I brought that thing home.

18:48.212 --> 18:52.858
I don't know where it is now, but I'm going to find it and wear it Halloween.

18:54.200 --> 19:01.411
Yeah, I went from 160 to 130, and our food wasn't too good.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.113
The guy on the right's named McAtee.

19:04.088 --> 19:09.794
real close friend of mine, and he is a dentist up in Wichita, Kansas now.

19:10.475 --> 19:22.087
He's one of the few living still, and this was at Officer's Candidate School the last day when we got commissioned, and we were actually simply inspecting that fellow.

19:22.107 --> 19:24.089
So this picture is probably at Camp Stewart, Georgia.

19:24.109 --> 19:25.350
That fellow was a Yankee.

19:25.771 --> 19:27.132
No, that was at Camp Davis.

19:27.152 --> 19:27.993
That was at Camp Davis?

19:28.133 --> 19:29.494
Officer's Candidate School there.

19:30.015 --> 19:32.137
And the one on the left is named Jim Beard.

19:32.177 --> 19:33.859
He was raised here in Bryan.

19:34.514 --> 19:40.265
He's dead, deceased, and the one behind him is Cecil Carlisle on the back from Allis, Texas.

19:40.286 --> 19:45.135
He's deceased this past year, and that's Cecil inspecting me there.

19:45.155 --> 19:47.079
We were pretty GI, as you can see.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.524
That's a pretty serious picture, yeah.

19:49.544 --> 19:52.590
I never took anything very seriously.

19:53.161 --> 19:54.583
Those were the days, yeah.

19:54.603 --> 19:55.724
Now, that's a great-looking shot.

19:55.784 --> 19:58.047
That's when I was cleaned up.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.028
That's a clean-cut-looking.

19:59.248 --> 20:00.350
I cleaned up pretty good, didn't I?

20:00.370 --> 20:01.912
You cleaned up good, as they say, absolutely.

20:02.412 --> 20:08.519
Yeah, I just got those bars and wanted to show off a little bit, so they took my picture somewhere.

20:10.201 --> 20:11.463
Now, explain this picture.

20:11.683 --> 20:12.544
I really like this picture.

20:12.564 --> 20:14.647
We look like an awful bunch of rogues.

20:15.528 --> 20:17.130
First, you may want to tell where this is at.

20:17.430 --> 20:17.851
I will.

20:17.891 --> 20:23.117
That's on the outside of Hart Hall on the campus here, right near Military Walk.

20:24.194 --> 20:31.224
And the guy in the white uniform is Ensign George Gay, the only survivor of Torpedo Squadron 8 in the Battle of Midway.

20:32.406 --> 20:33.647
He got shot in the arm.

20:33.728 --> 20:35.029
His plane was shot down.

20:35.070 --> 20:38.314
His gunner behind him got killed.

20:39.035 --> 20:42.781
He floated in the water and saw the whole battle nearly there.

20:42.901 --> 20:50.151
And he came back to A&M and made a big talk down in Kyle Field.

20:50.722 --> 20:55.868
He and Colonel Hilger, who was second commander of the raid on Tokyo, do little raid.

20:56.609 --> 20:59.472
All those guys in the picture were my seniors.

21:00.553 --> 21:09.644
I was the better commander, and I had an old western hat on there, third from the left, and all those fellows there are dead, but me.

21:10.445 --> 21:13.388
Gay's dead, too.

21:14.195 --> 21:16.379
President of American Airlines.

21:16.399 --> 21:18.122
I know Eastern, Eastern Airlines.

21:18.983 --> 21:19.784
Right, okay.

21:19.805 --> 21:21.147
And they're all gone there.

21:21.167 --> 21:26.876
In other words, they're all wiped out and they're getting lonesome.

21:27.317 --> 21:28.479
Those are some great pictures.

21:28.880 --> 21:33.688
So let's get back to the part where you basically, you would hurt your knee

21:33.668 --> 21:34.729
up in the mountains in the beginning.

21:34.749 --> 21:38.152
Yeah, they tore it up pretty good and they came up with it.

21:38.172 --> 21:42.356
But you more or less went about your business for what, almost two years with the Bumpy?

21:42.376 --> 21:47.742
Yeah, about a year and a half I stood around and tried to get along on it, but got fevered and big.

21:48.482 --> 21:54.008
So they put me on a hospital ship, which I don't remember getting on, but it's a sea snipe.

21:54.728 --> 21:59.013
About the middle of the trip home, I kind of remember a little bit.

21:59.994 --> 22:01.515
For some reason it was packed.

22:02.491 --> 22:03.713
Took 17 days.

22:04.714 --> 22:10.040
We landed at the docks there at Los Angeles at nighttime.

22:11.062 --> 22:16.408
And some of those kids had been overseas four years, you know, and they were just punch drunk.

22:16.428 --> 22:18.671
They wanted to get home so bad.

22:18.791 --> 22:29.224
And we looked at those lights of the city, and all of a sudden the lights on the pier came on, and there was a huge orchestra like Benny Goodman or some of those old bands.

22:30.267 --> 22:35.496
And Dinah Shore was there and she started singing to us, you know, and I cried like a baby.

22:35.536 --> 22:38.482
I remember she started singing, I'll walk alone.

22:38.502 --> 22:48.900
I was ready to get off and they made a stable the next day and took us into town on buses near Hollywood to Birmingham General Hospital.

22:49.657 --> 22:52.601
and gave us fried chicken, lettuce and tomatoes, and milk.

22:52.681 --> 22:54.464
That's what we hadn't had in the years.

22:54.484 --> 22:57.027
So that was probably the first real good home-cooked meal you had.

22:57.047 --> 22:58.269
That was the first meal, very first meal.

22:58.389 --> 23:06.921
And then we got on a train, went further up to Modesto to Hammond General Hospital, and I stayed there a while until I was discharged.

23:07.842 --> 23:11.167
Now, I understand, was it there that you ran into O.D.

23:11.227 --> 23:11.547
Butler?

23:12.028 --> 23:12.168
O.D.

23:12.188 --> 23:12.789
Butler and Jake Webster.

23:13.049 --> 23:15.593
You have a nice little story of what a small world this is.

23:15.713 --> 23:17.976
Well, this is a fantastic coincidence.

23:18.597 --> 23:25.124
I rode a lot of Aggies when I was overseas, and one of them was Jake Webster, Sweetwater.

23:25.905 --> 23:36.075
Jake's still alive, and he was in Armored Division and Patton's Army in Europe, and we wrote, and he said, you know, I've gotten shot, and I'm going to come home.

23:36.095 --> 23:36.796
I wrote him back.

23:36.816 --> 23:40.480
I said, I've got hurt in my knee, and I'm going to go home and get it operated on.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.823
I said, wouldn't it be great if we got put in the same hospital?

23:43.843 --> 23:45.425
Yeah, what was the likelihood of that happening?

23:45.565 --> 23:47.507
Well, I walked in.

23:47.825 --> 23:51.033
That play limped into it, and old O.D.

23:51.053 --> 23:57.049
Butler was sitting there, and I said, O.D., you have any idea where my bunk would be?

23:58.493 --> 24:01.501
He said, yeah, you're right over there next to Jake Webster.

24:01.721 --> 24:03.606
I could have almost passed out.

24:03.974 --> 24:06.320
We'd come a long way and got there together.

24:07.343 --> 24:10.050
That's got to be karma, somewhere along the way to get everybody back together.

24:10.070 --> 24:18.432
The length of the life or time of Patton's lieutenant platoon commanders was about two weeks.

24:18.452 --> 24:20.397
They either got wounded or killed.

24:20.765 --> 24:22.107
He got his quick.

24:23.409 --> 24:26.634
And so that's the beginning.

24:27.495 --> 24:35.506
So after you basically went through your hospital, you got your knee taken care of, and you basically ended up back, like we said at the beginning of the show, you more or less made a full circle.

24:35.526 --> 24:37.029
You got back here to College Station.

24:37.169 --> 24:48.966
Well, I finished school here, and I took some graduate work in poultry, animal science, and I was teaching teaching.

24:50.380 --> 25:00.697
poultry labs as a graduate assistant and these old GIs who I was teaching, you know, and they were always asleep or drunk or, you know, they were kind of unruly in class.

25:00.837 --> 25:02.881
It was hot, no air conditioning in those days.

25:04.063 --> 25:07.749
And I told my wife, I said, I don't think I'm cut out for this.

25:07.769 --> 25:10.253
I said, let's go to a ranch in some place.

25:10.293 --> 25:14.059
And so we moved from there to a little town of Barker, Texas, between Houston and Katy.

25:15.018 --> 25:18.201
Stayed there, didn't have any money, tried to get started ranching.

25:18.281 --> 25:22.406
And then I moved to Alice, Texas to work for a feed company.

25:22.426 --> 25:25.929
And I covered all of South Texas, every backyard in Texas.

25:26.010 --> 25:32.136
And one day, Mr. Herman Heap called me from Buda, Texas.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.739
He was a great aggie and benefactor.

25:34.779 --> 25:40.865
And he said, you want to come up here, I'll rent you a house and lease you two pastures.

25:40.885 --> 25:42.166
I was up there in a week.

25:42.187 --> 25:44.569
And my wife had one little child in.

25:45.140 --> 25:49.306
But we got up there and started out ranching with lots of money.

25:49.366 --> 25:53.132
I had a war bond and $400 I borrowed from somebody.

25:55.014 --> 26:00.242
And started the ranching business and we did pretty good at it.

26:00.262 --> 26:04.588
And the old man Heap was very generous and kind.

26:04.709 --> 26:08.234
If you were an Aggie and loved A&M like I did, he loved you.

26:08.414 --> 26:12.480
And he was most helpful to me.

26:13.321 --> 26:19.648
We got larger in the business and eventually I released a range in Center Texas.

26:20.709 --> 26:25.034
It was pretty good size and then ran two in Louisiana for some Houston people.

26:25.054 --> 26:26.135
Frank, we're running out of time.

26:26.155 --> 26:33.644
Well, I was too far away so I moved to College Station to get in the middle and the greatest thing that ever happened to me and my kids and my wife.

26:33.944 --> 26:36.747
Real quick before we run out of time, tell us about your kids.

26:37.351 --> 26:39.693
About the students?

26:39.713 --> 26:40.875
Well, no, more about your family.

26:40.895 --> 26:43.037
You don't want to know about the students in the class.

26:43.057 --> 26:43.517
We're running out.

26:43.537 --> 26:46.060
We're going to have to get you back and cover the students on the second show.

26:46.180 --> 26:51.385
Oh, that A, B, the... Well, my family is... I have two boys and a daughter.

26:51.405 --> 26:54.428
My daughter lives here, and both boys live in Georgetown, Texas.

26:54.448 --> 26:58.913
And they all... My son-in-law's in Aggie.

26:58.933 --> 27:02.616
He played football here when they whipped Bryant in the Cotton Bowl.

27:02.636 --> 27:04.699
And I'm proud of all of them.

27:04.739 --> 27:06.000
He was in the Air Force.

27:06.020 --> 27:06.160
And

27:06.781 --> 27:08.506
Got two sons in the Air Force.

27:08.647 --> 27:11.756
One flew over here yesterday and a B-52 bomber.

27:12.438 --> 27:13.080
Wow.

27:13.421 --> 27:15.648
And another one just starting training.

27:15.708 --> 27:19.660
So we do our best to serve our country and

27:20.095 --> 27:23.199
And A&M, they all love A&M.

27:23.219 --> 27:25.282
There's nothing like it.

27:25.402 --> 27:26.503
It was a home to me.

27:27.525 --> 27:28.466
It still is.

27:29.367 --> 27:33.112
Well, we're out of time, but I would like to thank you very much for being here.

27:33.553 --> 27:40.882
And we're definitely going to have to have you back just so we can hear the story of your unique grading system that really didn't catch quite on.

27:40.982 --> 27:42.424
But thank you for being here.

27:42.444 --> 27:43.606
Well, thank you so much.

27:43.626 --> 27:44.567
It's my pleasure.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.872
You know, Frank Litters Jr.

27:46.932 --> 27:50.015
was raised on a small farm between Katy and Houston, Texas.

27:50.496 --> 27:55.461
He was a Ross volunteer, the captain of the battery at Texas A&M in 1943.

27:55.501 --> 27:58.964
He served his country proudly and without reservation.

27:59.425 --> 28:04.470
Says he'd do it again, and by gosh, I think he would, even when he's 85 years old.

28:04.490 --> 28:07.153
We at Veterans of the Valley salute Frank Litters Jr.

28:07.833 --> 28:10.656
Until next time, goodbye.

28:14.990 --> 28:22.283
you
