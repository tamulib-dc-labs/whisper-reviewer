Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:28.459 --> 00:29.581
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:30.161 --> 00:35.387
You know John Happ for his service to our community over the years, but maybe you don't know

00:35.688 --> 00:37.533
him for his service to our country.

00:38.035 --> 00:42.006
John Happ is a flyer with some 40 combat missions in Vietnam.

00:42.026 --> 00:49.347
He loves to fly and he loves to talk about where he's been, like in some 29 landings on the ice runways of Antarctica.

00:49.808 --> 00:51.132
Welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:51.466 --> 00:52.467
Colonel John Happ.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.769
John, it's a pleasure to have you here.

00:53.789 --> 00:57.453
I've wanted to have you on Veterans of the Valley for a long time, and I finally got it.

00:57.493 --> 01:00.377
Your nickname is Happy, so I'm going to let you start off right now.

01:00.417 --> 01:03.140
You said that's a nickname you got even before you were born, right?

01:03.160 --> 01:10.169
Yes, my uncle nicknamed me Happy before I was born, said I don't care whether it's a girl or a boy, we're going to call it Happy.

01:10.189 --> 01:16.076
And, you know, as I said earlier, I was born kind of dumb, and now I'm fat, so I'm fat, dumb, and happy, so I'm perfect.

01:16.897 --> 01:17.338
Okay.

01:17.572 --> 01:23.662
Well, I'll call you Colonel Hap because of your service, not only in Vietnam, but service for so long in the military.

01:23.682 --> 01:25.685
And of course, that service has spilled over.

01:25.745 --> 01:32.095
As a lot of people here in the community know you as a former city councilman of the city of College Station and all the work you do.

01:32.115 --> 01:37.123
But I want to go all the way back to after you were born in Austin and you were raised in Ohio.

01:37.183 --> 01:38.385
Sort of talk about your youth.

01:38.765 --> 01:43.513
You wanted to be a baseball player, but you were a little too lightweight back then, right?

01:43.533 --> 01:45.115
Well, first of all, Tom, thank you.

01:45.668 --> 01:46.829
for this great opportunity.

01:46.849 --> 02:01.907
There's been some great Americans that have been here, and you've interviewed, and I feel such honored to have the opportunity to be here to talk about my career, and it was a wonderful career, and I look back at it now, especially this opportunity, and remember some really great things.

02:03.008 --> 02:15.102
And to go back now to say, I guess what I'd really like to say is that after I was born in Austin, I spent the first five years of my life right here in College Station, and then I came back

02:15.419 --> 02:17.702
63 and spent another lifetime here.

02:17.842 --> 02:30.239
I felt like getting a degree going through the Corps and then I came back in 93 and this is my home and it's been so good to us and it's such a great privilege too to be part of the Bryan College Station.

02:30.420 --> 02:31.141
Right.

02:31.361 --> 02:36.268
You came to A&M in the fall of 1963 and talk about your first day of school.

02:36.308 --> 02:39.993
You got here a day early by accident and you had to find a place to sleep that first night.

02:40.133 --> 02:45.240
I did and I remember the bus dropping me off at Eastgate with two footlockers and

02:45.760 --> 02:49.450
carrying one of them 100 yards and carrying the other one 100 yards past that one.

02:50.573 --> 02:58.916
It was during between semesters and, you know, of course, back then between semesters, this place was pretty well shut down.

02:59.177 --> 03:00.360
I spent the first night

03:01.100 --> 03:07.189
in the hospital, the old hospital in the basement before I went to fish camp the next day.

03:07.209 --> 03:07.890
Right, right.

03:08.451 --> 03:12.577
And you joined the Air Force ROTC as opposed to the Army ROTC.

03:12.597 --> 03:15.401
First, somebody had to tell you what ROTC stood for.

03:15.421 --> 03:18.866
And then once you figured that out, why did you join the Air Force instead of the Army?

03:18.886 --> 03:26.938
I remember it very, very, very distinctly that the last table you go to when you registered back in the old days in Sebesa,

03:27.712 --> 03:32.918
And when we got to the last table, the young lady says, do you want Air Force ROTC or Army ROTC?

03:33.699 --> 03:41.509
And of course, being somewhat of the traveling that I had done, I didn't realize that I had to go into ROTC.

03:41.529 --> 03:42.870
So I asked her, what's ROTC?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.712
And she says, reserve officer training corps.

03:45.714 --> 03:48.117
And I'm standing there kind of trying to decide.

03:48.157 --> 03:52.462
And the young man behind me says, in the Army, you got to carry a rifle.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.965
In the Air Force, you don't have to carry a rifle.

03:55.385 --> 03:56.807
I said, I want to go in the Air Force.

03:57.648 --> 03:58.849
That was an easy decision.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.031
That's right.

04:00.371 --> 04:04.056
You didn't have a whole lot of money, so it was hard to get home to see your parents in Ohio.

04:04.076 --> 04:10.043
So you sort of figured out by joining the fish drill team that that might be a free ticket to visit home every once in a while.

04:10.604 --> 04:11.745
Talk a little bit about that.

04:11.765 --> 04:18.894
And then I want you to go on and talk about a fellow named Bob Medina, who kind of saved you and helped you become a member of the fish drill team.

04:19.715 --> 04:22.238
Well, my my opportunity there was

04:22.842 --> 04:30.494
to get a chance to go to Indiana, to march in a competition in Indiana, which is not too far from Ohio.

04:30.534 --> 04:35.361
And I figured that that would be one of the few ways that I wouldn't have an opportunity to go home and see my folks.

04:35.461 --> 04:37.885
And I have wonderful folks.

04:37.905 --> 04:40.669
They've taught me so much and have stayed with me my whole life.

04:40.729 --> 04:43.253
They're doing very well in Ohio still.

04:43.273 --> 04:46.037
I'm really pleased to still have my parents.

04:46.198 --> 04:49.002
And so I wanted to try to get there and

04:49.657 --> 04:58.489
I went out for tryouts and obviously back then the core was much bigger and we had a lot of kids come out for tryouts.

04:59.650 --> 05:08.442
One night I was visited by, it turned out to be an upperclassman, Bob Medina, and of course I had to whip out and meet him and find out where he was from.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.085
And he told me, he said I wasn't going to make the drill team.

05:12.447 --> 05:16.372
And of course I knew he was a previous drill team.

05:16.413 --> 05:19.056
He was a sophomore and I was a freshman, but he was wearing a cord.

05:19.846 --> 05:23.189
And so I figured this is my downfall.

05:24.010 --> 05:25.411
And he said, well, do you really want to make it?

05:25.431 --> 05:26.372
And I said, yes, sir, I do.

05:26.432 --> 05:27.173
And he said, why?

05:27.533 --> 05:36.082
And I said, because I've learned in the short week that it's really an honor and a privilege to be part of the fish drill team.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.323
And he said, all right.

05:37.443 --> 05:46.592
And he taught me how to pivot, taught me how to do about face, and then gave me instructions to do square corners until the tryouts wrote with.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.013
And if it hadn't been for Bob Medina,

05:48.702 --> 05:50.344
I wouldn't have made the fish drill team.

05:50.364 --> 05:54.648
And it's obviously one of the highlights of my life was to be on the fish drill team.

05:54.868 --> 05:58.251
One great story when you were at Texas A&M was when you were about to get your commission.

05:58.271 --> 06:02.876
You were all set, ready to get the commission, but then got on the scales and you were a little bit underweight.

06:03.436 --> 06:05.338
You had a day of eating.

06:05.358 --> 06:06.059
Talk about that.

06:07.440 --> 06:13.206
The nurse at the hospital, when I went over there to weigh in and got on the scales, I was at Tablet Light.

06:13.226 --> 06:17.730
And she sent me back to Cebiza and said, I want you to eat every box of dry cereal

06:18.385 --> 06:20.049
and all the bananas you can eat.

06:20.069 --> 06:28.732
So I did do that and went over there when I came back she handed me a cup and sent me to the water cooler and said drink it until the water gets hot.

06:28.752 --> 06:32.361
I don't mind telling you that I was pretty well

06:32.847 --> 06:39.516
bloated from drinking all that, but I actually weighed in 129 pounds, two pounds of what I needed to weigh to get my commission.

06:39.536 --> 06:42.300
So you made the weight like a boxer looking to make the weight, right?

06:42.320 --> 06:45.445
I know that's kind of hard to believe, but yeah, I was that skinny at one time.

06:46.446 --> 06:54.377
I want to go back to your service in a minute, but I want to talk about, because I don't want to end this show without talking about your special relationship with Easterwood and Easterwood Airport.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.699
It's really all through your

06:55.679 --> 06:57.861
your career here when you got your license.

06:57.881 --> 07:02.526
Well, I'm going to let you tell the story, but you are Director of Aviation at Easterwood Airport now.

07:02.566 --> 07:07.391
You've been with Easterwood since 1996 and Director of Aviation since 2000.

07:07.431 --> 07:11.074
But Easterwood Airport means a lot to you really throughout your career, right?

07:11.094 --> 07:11.795
Oh, absolutely.

07:12.536 --> 07:13.497
I learned to fire there.

07:13.757 --> 07:23.627
Jack Taylor, who ran Texas Automotive at that time, helped me not only go through FIP there or the flight training program there,

07:24.215 --> 07:30.384
but pushed me pretty hard for me to go ahead and get my private license, and I did that at Eastwood.

07:30.404 --> 07:38.776
Also, right before I graduated, I had the opportunity to get engaged to my wife of 40 years as of December the 27th.

07:38.936 --> 07:39.517
My wife, Carol?

07:39.938 --> 07:41.160
My wife, Carol, that's correct.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.523
Right, right.

07:43.891 --> 07:46.013
You're the guy in charge there as director of aviation.

07:46.033 --> 07:54.883
So we could do several shows just about your job as director of aviation, because I know it's fascinating work, but I want to get back to your service after Texas A&M.

07:54.903 --> 07:58.827
Uh, you were going to go to Topeka, but then somebody said, Hey, why don't you go to Randolph?

07:58.847 --> 08:02.532
There's not quite the washout raid at Randolph as there was at Willie at Topeka.

08:02.592 --> 08:08.038
So, uh, sort of, uh, talk about, uh, that about being at Randolph, but you didn't get to go to Randolph immediately.

08:08.078 --> 08:10.881
You had to go back home to Ohio and sort of wait out your orders.

08:10.941 --> 08:11.181
Right.

08:11.515 --> 08:11.895
Yes, sir.

08:12.476 --> 08:19.485
When we graduated, we actually were lucky enough at that time to get your choice of basis.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.650
And as you said, I had orders for Willie, which is in Arizona.

08:23.891 --> 08:24.732
Arizona, excuse me.

08:24.872 --> 08:34.384
And then a friend of mine who retired as a four-star in my outfit at A&M was Pat Gamble called me and said,

08:34.803 --> 08:38.446
why don't you go to Randolph Air Force Base and go to pilot training with me?

08:38.466 --> 08:40.828
And I said, Pat, they don't have pilot training at Randolph.

08:41.629 --> 08:42.530
And he said, well, they're gonna.

08:42.970 --> 08:45.172
And I said, yeah, but I would like to go to Willie.

08:45.212 --> 08:47.634
That's the nickname for Williams Air Force Base.

08:47.935 --> 08:48.755
I'd like to go to Willie.

08:48.775 --> 08:50.997
That's the premier base of the Air Force.

08:51.978 --> 08:56.502
And he said, well, my dad says, and his dad was a one-star in the Air Force.

08:57.243 --> 09:04.489
Actually, at that time, a colonel said that the washout rate at Willie's is about 20%, but because Randolph's gonna be a new

09:04.520 --> 09:07.425
flight training program that the washout rate will be less than 10%.

09:08.166 --> 09:17.222
So I needlessly ran down the very next day and got my orders changed to go to Randolph and it delayed my entrance date from February to May.

09:17.242 --> 09:22.471
Well, I actually didn't know when I left when I was actually going to go, but ended up going in the end of May.

09:22.992 --> 09:26.157
And so I did, I went back to Ohio and, uh,

09:26.525 --> 09:28.247
I actually had a great opportunity.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.589
I had a chance to teach school.

09:29.609 --> 09:32.753
Right, you taught industrial art to some Amish kids, right?

09:32.773 --> 09:36.898
Well, they were out of the Amish program.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.160
A lot of them were, yes, sir.

09:38.240 --> 09:53.460
It was right next to Black River High School, right next to Ashland County, and a pretty good-sized high school, but a lot of the students had come out of the Amish communities and spoke very broken English, and

09:53.930 --> 10:01.723
I think I had mentioned to you before, I think I learned as much from them as I actually taught them because these kids had great talent with their hands.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.746
That was very rewarding, I know.

10:03.766 --> 10:07.692
You went into pilot training in May of 68, got out in June of 69.

10:08.494 --> 10:17.428
And I want you to sort of backtrack because I want to talk about one individual that you told me about that really start at Texas A&M, fellow named Marcus Hurley.

10:17.448 --> 10:20.393
And sort of when you met him and then later when you met him again and

10:20.778 --> 10:22.761
his sort of get back to you a little bit.

10:23.202 --> 10:25.104
Sort of take us through that story quickly, if you will.

10:25.185 --> 10:37.303
Well, I kind of almost hate to admit this to all my classmates, but you know, it's not your privilege to take advantage of an upperclassman, except for the class directly ahead of you.

10:38.124 --> 10:46.496
But I had an incident after one night at Fishville team coming back, I was balancing the weapon on my palm of my hand, walking back to the dormitory.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.080
And this

10:50.022 --> 10:56.792
Junior at the time, and I was just a freshman, told me to come up to his room and proceeded to put me through the drill.

10:58.014 --> 11:04.003
And I kind of avoided him for the rest of the time until right before his graduation.

11:04.063 --> 11:08.149
Now, I'm just a sophomore, but I saw him walking up from dorm 12 carrying his laundry.

11:09.074 --> 11:16.082
And so I went out in the hall and called for some freshmen, locked my door, and they hung his laundry in the trees.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.865
And, of course, he's looking around wanting to know who did this.

11:18.965 --> 11:25.954
And so I hit, actually, very safely, so he didn't know I had done this.

11:27.235 --> 11:36.786
And so I felt really good that I got back at him for what he had done to me when I was a freshman until we graduated from T-37s and we marched down to the T-38 hangars.

11:37.323 --> 11:41.169
and walked into the T-38 flight room, and guess who one of the instructors is?

11:41.469 --> 11:46.237
And I went home that night and said, Carol, there's no way that I'm going to graduate from pilot training.

11:46.257 --> 11:47.799
And she said, why?

11:47.819 --> 11:52.967
And I said, well, because one of the instructors is Marcus Hurley, and I don't think he thinks too much of me.

11:53.568 --> 12:01.761
And so all the way through the program, he never, ever made any qualms, or I should say he showed any preference that he even knew me.

12:02.382 --> 12:06.748
And guys would ask me, Happy, you were at A&M the same time Marcus was.

12:06.788 --> 12:07.910
Didn't you know Marcus?

12:08.110 --> 12:10.974
Yeah, I knew Marcus and knew of him, but he was an upperclassman.

12:10.994 --> 12:13.838
I didn't have anything to do with him.

12:13.858 --> 12:24.813
Well, then the last, well, two days before graduation, I was turning in our distributing our scrapbooks that we had done, our yearbook.

12:26.135 --> 12:32.203
And I walked in the flight room, and there's a note up there, Lieutenant Happ, you're scheduled to fly at 1,400 that particular day.

12:32.993 --> 12:34.094
I knew nothing about it.

12:34.535 --> 12:37.478
And of course, I'd already turned in most of my equipment, my G suit.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.482
So I borrowed a flight suit and I was wearing low quarters.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.322
I didn't have boots.

12:41.943 --> 12:46.168
They were at the house and I did have my helmet that was still in the helmet room.

12:46.268 --> 12:53.917
Got my helmet, rushed back there and walked in the room and there stood Marcus in his G suit and his gloves and his helmet and said, where have you been?

12:54.237 --> 12:55.138
We need to get airborne.

12:55.759 --> 12:59.423
So we got in the bus and we rode out there and he said, just strap in, I'll do the pre-flight and

13:00.196 --> 13:01.217
I said, well, what are we going to do?

13:01.257 --> 13:02.058
Why am I flying?

13:02.078 --> 13:04.962
He said, well, you need 210 hours to graduate, and you got 209.2.

13:06.304 --> 13:08.126
You need 8 tenths of an hour.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.068
And I said, well, what are we going to do for 18?

13:10.088 --> 13:11.170
He said, well, you're going to ride.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.531
I'm going to go get proficiency.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.633
So I said, OK, great.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.654
So I got in the front seat.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.096
He got in the back seat.

13:16.116 --> 13:20.541
He pulled the tarp over for his hooded takeoff.

13:20.561 --> 13:23.385
And we got up to the altitude, and subconsciously,

13:23.888 --> 13:26.774
I'm hearing him talking on the radio, but I'm enjoying the view.

13:26.814 --> 13:28.338
I never had a chance to look around before.

13:28.378 --> 13:29.901
I mean, I could see Dallas.

13:29.961 --> 13:30.903
I could see Houston.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.066
I could see San Antonio.

13:32.086 --> 13:33.790
Well, I never had a chance to look around before.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.854
I was too busy flying.

13:35.874 --> 13:40.885
And then I subconsciously hear him say that he would take Area 5 right below us.

13:41.776 --> 13:45.982
He rolled inverted, and that's all I remembered part of that.

13:46.022 --> 13:53.512
I went down in the seat because I didn't have a G suit on, and as he was pulling about six Gs, he said, that'll teach you to hang my laundry.

13:53.652 --> 13:55.635
And so he had remembered.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.160
So afterwards, I asked him, I said, Marcus, how did you find out?

13:59.240 --> 14:01.523
And he said, well, I went to a football game last fall.

14:01.823 --> 14:05.407
And he happened to run into Fish Bird, who was one of the freshmen that hung his laundry.

14:05.487 --> 14:08.290
And of course, Fish Bird confessed and told him he had done it.

14:09.652 --> 14:10.653
That's a great story.

14:10.673 --> 14:12.916
He probably remembers you, and you certainly do remember him.

14:13.236 --> 14:17.761
One of your jobs at Randolph, because you'd had a little journalism, they asked you to put out a yearbook.

14:17.781 --> 14:21.085
As a matter of fact, here is the yearbook right here that he put out.

14:21.526 --> 14:25.350
And I want to read just about from...

14:25.988 --> 14:30.975
from your little autobiography here in the yearbook and let you explain this paragraph.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.399
It says, one problem kept plaguing Happy during flight training.

14:34.419 --> 14:36.502
He simply could not keep track of his possessions.

14:36.983 --> 14:41.529
After losing a Corvette and a new dog, he discovered that there are thieves abroad.

14:41.549 --> 14:45.173
So he bought a leash for his car and a burglar alarm for his dog.

14:45.714 --> 14:46.816
That's an Aggie for you.

14:47.196 --> 14:48.638
How'd you lose your dog and your Corvette?

14:50.035 --> 14:58.064
Well, unfortunately, getting the Corvette is another story, and I'll tell you that someday, but I actually had the Corvette stolen.

14:58.265 --> 14:58.705
Oh, my goodness.

14:58.725 --> 14:59.846
While I was in pilot training.

14:59.926 --> 15:09.377
And the dog is really a great story because my mom and dad have always wanted a Maltese, and that's our favorite dog.

15:10.459 --> 15:15.925
And I happened to find one in the paper and purchased the young dog and

15:16.698 --> 15:24.011
We got home that night, and we lived in a courtyard area, and I opened the cage and let him get out and go to the bathroom, and he disappeared.

15:24.031 --> 15:25.313
I mean, he took off like a shot.

15:25.534 --> 15:36.934
And somebody had turned him in, and when I went down, I almost didn't recognize him because he was almost pitch black by the time, and matted and really dirty, but it turned out to be my mom and dad's

15:37.522 --> 15:38.924
the joy of their life.

15:38.964 --> 15:41.186
That was their first Maltese.

15:41.206 --> 15:44.169
They've had three or four since, but Paco was a great dog.

15:44.269 --> 15:44.930
That's a great story.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.512
I want to look at some photographs.

15:46.532 --> 15:53.359
We've got four photographs to look at real quick, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to talk about your service in Vietnam, and we're going to talk about Antarctica, too.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.201
But these are just some photographs.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.644
Here's the first one from Texas A&M.

15:57.664 --> 16:00.306
There is a young cadet, John Happ.

16:00.386 --> 16:01.808
What year were you here on?

16:02.227 --> 16:05.453
That was my freshman year, 1963, 64.

16:06.976 --> 16:08.378
As part of the fish drill team.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.179
Yes, sir.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.003
It's the fish drill team uniform.

16:11.063 --> 16:22.423
And probably one of the proudest things that ever happened to me was having that opportunity to drill in Indiana where my folks did come and got to see the fish drill team drill.

16:22.483 --> 16:25.669
And I think we had a great team.

16:26.003 --> 16:26.724
Okay.

16:26.764 --> 16:27.645
Tell about this picture.

16:27.665 --> 16:29.506
This picture is hanging in your office, right?

16:29.526 --> 16:30.888
That's one of my favorite pictures.

16:30.948 --> 16:53.209
My mother was a society editor to the newspaper there in town, and what it doesn't show is my wife's actually taking pictures, and it really dates us because it shows one of those plastic instant-minute cameras that you used to be able to buy for $16, and she was taking pictures, and I was unfortunately making fun of one of the pictures she had taken.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.963
My mom snapped both of us at Christmas.

16:57.023 --> 16:58.085
That was my Christmas.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.327
I'm sorry.

16:59.347 --> 17:07.479
Right after graduation, my junior year, I'd just gotten home from A&M, and she had asked me to put my uniform on, and so I did.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.341
That's a wonderful picture.

17:10.283 --> 17:11.805
This was taken at Randolph, right?

17:12.443 --> 17:12.924
Yes, sir.

17:13.104 --> 17:24.056
Actually, when we were trying to get pictures for the yearbook, I took a picture of all the cadets as we were going through with T-38s.

17:24.216 --> 17:26.698
And as I said, what a great toy.

17:27.259 --> 17:28.000
Great airplane.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.762
I enjoyed flying it very much.

17:30.903 --> 17:31.584
Right.

17:31.604 --> 17:33.946
And like I said, I don't remember being that skinny.

17:33.966 --> 17:38.131
A lot of us have that problem, as a matter of fact.

17:38.151 --> 17:41.995
Then finally, here is, I guess, your official Air Force photograph.

17:42.464 --> 17:51.114
Well, that was taken when I was at Scott Air Force Base as Director of Acquisition right before I moved here.

17:51.374 --> 17:51.615
Right.

17:52.756 --> 17:54.218
John, talk about Vietnam.

17:54.278 --> 17:56.981
You served there some 40 combat missions in Vietnam.

17:57.001 --> 17:58.783
You wanted to fly a fighter.

17:58.823 --> 18:00.525
You never got to do that as much as you wanted.

18:00.545 --> 18:03.268
You were a C-130 pilot for most of your time.

18:03.288 --> 18:08.474
But talk about your service in Vietnam, some 19 months you spent in country.

18:08.514 --> 18:08.995
Is that right?

18:09.380 --> 18:22.500
I actually was stationed in the CCK or Ching Chang Kong Air Base in Taiwan, and we would rotate in at 15 days at a time, and that way we weren't really counted as part of being assigned to Vietnam.

18:22.540 --> 18:25.004
We were actually outside of Vietnam assigned there.

18:26.086 --> 18:34.679
But I did have the opportunity to fly C-130 missions in Vietnam, a lot of resupply and cargo, and what a great tactical airplane.

18:35.220 --> 18:37.243
I got to do a few tactical things.

18:37.882 --> 18:45.772
While I was there, we actually took a combat control team up north of Quang Tree.

18:45.793 --> 18:51.540
When I took them into there and came back out, the next time I went back in, it was unbelievable.

18:51.600 --> 19:01.393
There must have been 2,000 tents, and it was a reorganization just north of Quang Tree, which is in the very north providence of North Vietnam.

19:01.413 --> 19:03.897
Then I had the opportunity, which I can't talk a whole lot about.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.859
I had the opportunity to fly a classified mission.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.281
I did that for...

19:07.615 --> 19:10.219
almost 10 months, my last 10 months there.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.585
So when we talk about 40 combat missions, those are the ones that count.

19:13.645 --> 19:15.168
Those are the ones that I can report.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.450
That you can report.

19:17.332 --> 19:22.741
Tell us what you can tell us about your job and the classified missions in Vietnam.

19:22.761 --> 19:27.028
I know it's limited what you still to this day can actually divulge.

19:27.048 --> 19:30.855
Well, I think the kind of missions that we flew were

19:31.426 --> 19:55.311
Unmarked aircraft we had no markings we flew without any identification So I'd already give you some idea of some of the places that we had the opportunity to go into And that's what makes this airplane so great and why I enjoyed the mission so much is it's so Versatile and so flexible that you can use it for a lot of different things and I got a great chance to do that Yeah, were the missions dangerous missions?

19:55.351 --> 19:57.433
I mean were they were they missions that you

19:57.953 --> 20:00.400
I think they would have been dangerous if we'd have been captured.

20:00.641 --> 20:01.002
Right.

20:01.163 --> 20:01.905
Yes, sir.

20:01.925 --> 20:02.166
Yeah.

20:02.587 --> 20:03.630
Yeah.

20:03.650 --> 20:04.874
Well, again, thank you for that.

20:04.934 --> 20:09.769
Obviously, that's the part that you'll take with you, you know, your whole life.

20:10.036 --> 20:12.239
And certainly understand that.

20:12.259 --> 20:13.921
I came back from Vietnam.

20:13.961 --> 20:15.764
You had been there for 18, 19 months.

20:16.284 --> 20:18.347
You came back in 1972.

20:18.367 --> 20:22.032
Talk a little bit about your post-Vietnam career.

20:22.412 --> 20:26.838
And eventually, you have such a diverse background.

20:26.878 --> 20:29.161
You spent some time in New Zealand.

20:29.181 --> 20:33.367
Once you figured out where New Zealand was, that was just one of the great couple of years of your life.

20:33.687 --> 20:38.153
Talk about that because you got to fly a whole lot when you and your wife lived in New Zealand.

20:38.285 --> 20:39.086
Yes, sir, I did.

20:39.146 --> 20:41.850
I had a great opportunity to be an exchange pilot.

20:42.791 --> 20:48.779
And during that time, I got to fly in the Queen's Jubilee and got to fly Queen Elizabeth's.

20:48.979 --> 20:55.648
Actually, flew to a Rolls Royce's more than I had the opportunity to be with her.

20:55.668 --> 20:59.534
But flew all over the South Pacific, went to nearly every island in the South Pacific.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.997
The Kiwis or the New Zealanders.

21:02.551 --> 21:07.561
They used that airplane, again, very, very versatile aircraft.

21:07.581 --> 21:09.925
They used it as passenger run.

21:09.945 --> 21:13.633
They would use it for cargo runs and spent a lot.

21:13.673 --> 21:17.961
I actually probably spent more time away from New Zealand than I did the whole time I was there.

21:18.001 --> 21:21.408
It's a beautiful country, beautiful people.

21:21.428 --> 21:25.015
What a great opportunity that both my wife and son and I had.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.080
I have two years in New Zealand.

21:27.261 --> 21:32.185
Yeah, you said you flew nearly 1,100, some 1,100 hours in 19 months.

21:32.205 --> 21:34.227
So that's an awful lot of flying.

21:34.267 --> 21:34.848
It is.

21:34.868 --> 21:36.149
You got to fly an awful lot of places.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.733
To go anywhere from New Zealand is almost an overnight flight.

21:39.773 --> 21:40.493
Right, exactly.

21:40.613 --> 21:41.654
In a 130, yes, sir.

21:41.674 --> 21:47.180
I know we're kind of hopping around with your career, but at DICE Air Force Base, one of the jobs that you had was as a test pilot.

21:47.780 --> 21:51.524
And you got to fly some 50 new, brand new planes from Lockheed.

21:51.544 --> 21:51.824
I did.

21:51.884 --> 21:54.647
I picked up 50 new H models, delivered them to...

21:55.150 --> 21:58.013
to Abilene right before I went to New Zealand.

21:58.073 --> 22:07.384
So I had a great opportunity to go through maintenance officer school and get my test pilot rating and actually flew test tops.

22:07.404 --> 22:07.644
Right.

22:07.924 --> 22:13.991
And with some of those, you had some brand new co-pilots with you and that instruction part of it you enjoyed also.

22:14.592 --> 22:15.173
I did.

22:15.673 --> 22:20.078
I tried to fly with the young new co-pilots because you had a chance to

22:20.851 --> 22:31.285
shut down all four engines, install that aircraft, and they don't get to do that in training, but doing test tops and had the opportunity to do that quite often on the full phase of flights.

22:31.305 --> 22:33.508
Why don't you tell a story and then we're going to talk about Antarctica.

22:34.189 --> 22:41.579
When you came back to College Station finally for the final time in 1993, talk about a trip that you made to Austin and a fellow you ran into.

22:41.900 --> 22:46.386
Well, it has to do with flying those test tops and flying with co-pilots.

22:47.007 --> 22:51.013
I went to Austin in 93, Colonel Happ, to do a recruiting mission for the Corps.

22:51.734 --> 23:00.185
And while I was there, a gentleman came up behind me and tapped me on the shoulder and said, Colonel, are you the John Happ that was a captain in Dias in 73?

23:00.225 --> 23:00.886
And I said, yes, sir.

23:00.906 --> 23:02.188
He said, well, you scared me to death.

23:02.869 --> 23:06.294
Well, it really made me kind of feel bad because I thought I was a better pilot than that.

23:06.334 --> 23:08.577
But he said, I said, how did I scare you?

23:09.063 --> 23:14.168
And he said, well, my first flight there was as a co-pilot in these test tops.

23:14.248 --> 23:20.294
And you were the test pilot, and you briefed on Friday night about we were going to stall the airplane and shut down all four engines.

23:20.314 --> 23:23.937
And he said, Saturday morning came, and I didn't sleep at all Friday night.

23:23.957 --> 23:24.978
He said, I was scared to death.

23:25.879 --> 23:31.064
And it turned out to be, which is now our governor, Governor Perry.

23:31.084 --> 23:33.927
He was an agriculture commissioner back then.

23:34.308 --> 23:37.651
So I guess you see him from time to time, and he still reminds you of that, right?

23:37.671 --> 23:38.952
Yes, sir.

23:39.117 --> 23:51.249
We got about three and a half minutes left, not enough time to talk about Antarctica, but you made some 29 flights into Antarctica and weather and conditions and things like that was a big deal as far as flying into Antarctica.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.571
But what an experience.

23:52.631 --> 23:53.191
Talk about it.

23:53.211 --> 23:55.774
Well, there's no forecasted weather there.

23:55.914 --> 23:59.818
You have to go by trends and how the weather is.

23:59.878 --> 24:01.860
And it can be a beautiful sunny day.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.703
But if you have seven knots of wind, you start getting obscuration.

24:05.240 --> 24:09.185
at nine knots of wind, it's partial observation, 11 knots of wind, it's a whiteout.

24:09.205 --> 24:12.809
You can't see me and you standing this close to each other when it's a whiteout.

24:13.390 --> 24:18.436
It's about 18 foot deep to 20 feet deep if the winds pick up, and it'd be sunny above it.

24:18.817 --> 24:24.143
And then that sun causes the refraction and reflection of the light in those ice crystals.

24:24.504 --> 24:25.665
Right, right.

24:25.685 --> 24:28.148
And you learned some ice survival while you were there also.

24:28.168 --> 24:28.328
I did.

24:28.348 --> 24:31.332
I had the opportunity to go through survival twice, once.

24:31.413 --> 24:37.222
Before I went down, then I took the Australians through, trained a bunch of Australians to start flying down there.

24:38.865 --> 24:43.412
And I was right, when you landed on some of these runways, they were actually floating runways?

24:43.492 --> 24:43.732
Correct.

24:43.792 --> 24:52.065
The ice runway, we call it, has to be 116 inches thick, but it's actually out in the Bay Area away from what land there is.

24:52.165 --> 24:58.315
But that's just the ice shelf, and we go out and land on the runway that's been cut

24:58.818 --> 25:04.144
level with a bulldozer, but it's actually more than 116 inches of ice.

25:04.164 --> 25:05.265
You talked about why you were there.

25:05.325 --> 25:09.630
Sometimes the whiteouts were so bad that you actually had to follow rope so you wouldn't get lost.

25:09.650 --> 25:15.216
You could be three feet away from one of your houses there and not know where you were.

25:15.296 --> 25:15.897
You wouldn't know it.

25:15.997 --> 25:16.398
No, sir.

25:16.438 --> 25:19.841
It was the first time down there.

25:19.881 --> 25:20.983
I'll never forget it.

25:21.303 --> 25:22.304
It was awesome.

25:22.324 --> 25:24.066
As far as you could see, everything was white.

25:24.927 --> 25:25.027
Wow.

25:25.047 --> 25:26.349
As far as you could see.

25:27.390 --> 25:27.610
Wow.

25:28.062 --> 25:29.484
depth perception whatsoever.

25:29.564 --> 25:36.394
Very, very few shadows, obviously no trees, not many buildings, especially close to the runway.

25:37.415 --> 25:40.440
John Hap, talk about your family real quick in the last minute that we have.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.401
Of course, your wife, Carol.

25:41.561 --> 25:43.404
Talk about the rest of your family.

25:43.424 --> 25:45.988
My wife, Carol, is a principal in Bryan.

25:46.148 --> 25:46.989
I'm so proud of her.

25:47.049 --> 25:48.451
She's a Blue Ribbon School twice.

25:49.413 --> 25:52.517
And my son, John, has his own business in Houston.

25:53.324 --> 25:59.558
And doing very well, and he's a graduate of 93, or class of 93, and really proud of him.

25:59.618 --> 26:02.765
And his wife, Nellie, who's kind of a TV star in Houston.

26:03.707 --> 26:06.594
And I have a grandson, Jackson, who I'm very, very proud of.

26:06.634 --> 26:07.536
He's five years old.

26:08.225 --> 26:10.190
I know, and they're very proud of you, and we're proud of you.

26:10.230 --> 26:11.613
Thank you very much for your service.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.317
30 minutes goes awfully quickly.

26:13.337 --> 26:17.407
We could do several shows on your service, and thank you very much for joining us, John.

26:17.427 --> 26:18.048
Thank you.

26:18.068 --> 26:19.893
What a great opportunity to visit with you.

26:20.173 --> 26:20.534
All right.

26:20.574 --> 26:20.935
Thank you.

26:21.196 --> 26:24.664
A little wonder that John Happ's passion for flying has landed him.

26:24.644 --> 26:28.454
in a job that he loves as Director of Aviation at Easterwood Airport.

26:28.474 --> 26:37.998
We salute John Happ for his service as an Air Force officer, as a former member of the College Station City Council, and as a very, very valued citizen of the Brazos Valley.

26:38.018 --> 26:39.000
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:39.101 --> 26:41.607
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.064
In honor of the veterans who have served our country
