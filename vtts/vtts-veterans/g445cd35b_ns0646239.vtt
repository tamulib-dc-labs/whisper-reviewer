00:00.858 --> 00:25.127
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley, I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:25.681 --> 00:32.853
Over the last two and a half years of Veterans of the Valley, we have been honored to share the stories of 74 Brazos Valley veterans.

00:33.313 --> 00:34.896
The very first was Dr. Jim Cooper.

00:34.996 --> 00:38.061
We taped that show on March the 1st, 2005.

00:38.462 --> 00:39.764
It was new territory for me.

00:39.824 --> 00:42.709
It was new territory for KAMU-TV.

00:42.729 --> 00:51.503
It is my pleasure to welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, Dr. James F. Cooper, World War II veteran and our 75th veteran guest here on Veterans of the Valley.

00:51.483 --> 00:55.493
Go back 30 months ago, and I can remember this set, Jim.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.796
We didn't have the nice flags.

00:56.816 --> 00:57.818
It was just a black set.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.582
I wasn't sure what I was doing.

00:59.603 --> 01:00.625
You weren't sure what you were doing.

01:00.665 --> 01:01.667
We were both kind of nervous.

01:01.888 --> 01:03.492
I'm still not.

01:03.512 --> 01:08.985
You were the guinea pig for this show, and thankfully you were because 75 veterans later, we're still here.

01:09.472 --> 01:10.554
You kind of remember that day.

01:10.574 --> 01:11.114
You were nervous.

01:11.154 --> 01:11.655
I was nervous.

01:11.835 --> 01:18.105
New territory for me, and I thought you said 75 years ago we taped the first one.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.166
It wasn't quite that long.

01:19.186 --> 01:19.807
Not quite.

01:19.827 --> 01:22.631
It was about two and a half years ago, but it was a lot of fun.

01:22.772 --> 01:32.265
And thank you for starting this off because it's been a great service to the veterans of the Brazos Valley, I think, and 74 veterans, and here you are back again.

01:32.286 --> 01:34.669
I think it's been something that the veterans appreciate.

01:35.341 --> 01:44.275
Tom, it was a privilege to be here, and certainly I'm happy that it has gone as well as it has gone for you and for the veterans.

01:44.375 --> 01:52.107
Well, we thank KAMU-TV and our underwriter, First National Bank, for keeping it going, and we really appreciate it, and thank you for starting it off.

01:52.127 --> 01:55.732
As a matter of fact, let's sort of take a look at what you and I looked like two and a half years ago.

01:55.973 --> 02:01.742
Let's take a little clip of that very first show, Veterans of the Valley, that we taped in March of 2005.

02:02.142 --> 02:02.563
Here we go.

02:03.117 --> 02:05.880
You are a practicing physician now.

02:05.900 --> 02:11.367
We're going to talk a little bit about that more later, but I want to talk about your service in World War II in Korea.

02:11.387 --> 02:17.694
You were a young teenager right after VJ Day, and you saw a lot of remnants of the war as a very young man.

02:17.714 --> 02:24.602
Tom, I was 17 when I enlisted and then went to boot camp and was on my way to Japan.

02:25.088 --> 02:28.434
when World War II ended with the dropping of the first A-bomb.

02:29.396 --> 02:45.325
And there are questions that come up about whether or not I'm in favor of having dropped those two A-bombs, and the answer is always overwhelmingly yes, because had those two bombs not been dropped, I might not have been here.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.890
I would have been in the first invasion forces

02:47.870 --> 03:05.558
going into Japan and it was estimated that there would have been four million casualties had we invaded Japan, three million Japanese and one million allied forces and so even though there was a great, great sacrifice of life with those two bombs and we wish we had not

03:06.196 --> 03:07.882
had to drop them.

03:07.902 --> 03:09.708
It was a necessary thing.

03:09.949 --> 03:18.298
It was something that saved countless millions of lives and we're sorry that some people had to be sacrificed for that.

03:19.223 --> 03:21.688
And 75 veterans later, we're still here.

03:21.708 --> 03:22.750
And thankfully we are.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.553
Let's talk about Dr. Jim Cooper.

03:24.613 --> 03:25.676
You were a Navy man.

03:25.696 --> 03:26.838
You were in World War II.

03:26.898 --> 03:30.325
You also, during the Korean War, served in the North Atlantic.

03:30.345 --> 03:34.132
But you've served actually at two different times, before and after your schooling.

03:34.192 --> 03:36.777
Sort of talk about your first hitch of duty.

03:37.229 --> 03:44.696
Tom, I was barely 18 years old and I thought Japan was just the other side of Fulton, Kentucky when I enlisted.

03:44.716 --> 03:53.944
And I did go to the Great Lakes Naval Training Center and then was on the way to Japan when the first two atom bombs were dropped.

03:53.964 --> 03:57.868
And people always ask me, do I agree that they should have been dropped?

03:57.888 --> 04:04.093
And my answer is profoundly yes, because had they not been dropped, I probably wouldn't be here.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.835
They estimated there'd be one and a half

04:06.085 --> 04:12.060
Allied, million Allied casualties, four and a half million Japanese casualties.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.513
Even though the bombs were horrible, they saved millions of lives and much grief and misery.

04:17.830 --> 04:26.168
Talk about serving as a physician in World War II and sort of what kind of a job that was, the responsibility, and your main memories of that.

04:26.188 --> 04:27.671
Because you served on a lot of ships.

04:27.691 --> 04:31.459
You were kind of a ship hopper to different destroyers taking care of people, right?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.784
Tom, that was the Korean conflict.

04:33.804 --> 04:37.031
World War II, I was not a physician.

04:37.051 --> 04:38.033
Right, right, right.

04:38.013 --> 04:42.759
The Korean conflict, I was a destroyer squadron medical officer.

04:43.460 --> 04:56.276
I had eight destroyers and one very famous destroyer in that squadron was the USS Sullivans that was named after the five Sullivan brothers who perished in World War II aboard the cruiser Juno.

04:56.837 --> 04:59.160
I could ride any ship I wanted to.

04:59.140 --> 05:07.611
My operating room and my operating table was the officer's mess table that we had to clear off if, in fact, I did have to operate.

05:07.711 --> 05:08.152
That's right.

05:08.573 --> 05:14.941
One of the ships that you served on was the USS Admiral Benson, and you told me one time about a hurricane.

05:14.961 --> 05:17.825
I guess we called it a tsunami now that you went through.

05:17.845 --> 05:19.968
We called it a typhoon, Tom.

05:19.988 --> 05:23.292
That occurred in 1945 at Okinawa.

05:23.913 --> 05:39.103
And years and years later, I was speaking to Mr. Travis Bryan and Mr. George Ferrari here in Bryan, found out that the three of us were on that ship at the same time and we didn't know it until about 10 years ago.

05:39.243 --> 05:39.323
Wow.

05:39.303 --> 05:43.691
Very, very bad typhoon, and incidentally they're having one there today.

05:43.712 --> 05:45.034
Exactly, exactly.

05:45.054 --> 05:52.348
You served in Bethesda, Maryland, and obviously that was something very unique, obviously, for you.

05:52.408 --> 05:57.919
And you saw a lot of the famous characters of World War II come through that place while you were serving there.

05:58.220 --> 06:09.156
Tom, I was there in 1952 as an intern, and of course the World War II older officers in the Navy were coming through Bethesda.

06:09.176 --> 06:15.225
We had four five-star admirals on the floor at one time while I was there.

06:15.245 --> 06:19.992
Halsey, Nimitz, Halstead, and I can't remember the other one, but they were

06:19.972 --> 06:42.469
fairly unique peep king was the other one right and it was a privilege to be there when all of these world war ii historical characters came through yes even shirley temple was there shirley temple was there as a patient her husband was a commander in the navy downtown washington during the korean conflict and she and her children came to bethesda all the time

06:42.854 --> 06:48.838
You recently gave a speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

06:48.858 --> 06:52.071
It was, I believe it was Memorial Day observance.

06:52.540 --> 06:57.207
with the VFW and the American Legion and the DAV and you gave a speech.

06:57.287 --> 06:58.849
Can you talk a little bit about that speech?

06:59.029 --> 07:19.999
Tom, the main theme of the speech was to memorialize the people who had given their lives for the freedoms that we now enjoy in the United States and I made one point about standing before the tomb of the unknown soldier and wondering who he was, wondering how he was as a little boy, wondering about his mother who

07:20.654 --> 07:27.841
when told that her little boy was not coming home, that he was a casualty of war, how she must have felt.

07:27.901 --> 07:42.074
And then I've wondered how many other mothers have stood before the three unknown tombs there now wanting to reach inside, wondering if their little boy might have been inside, but of course it wouldn't be until the great resurrection day.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.255
Exactly.

07:43.415 --> 07:46.478
It was quite a moving speech and I know that they appreciate that.

07:46.498 --> 07:48.720
And this takes me to

07:48.835 --> 07:53.184
What I want to ask you about your passion for your fellow veterans, the VFW.

07:53.204 --> 07:54.987
You've been very active in the VFW.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.831
You were past commander of the VFW.

07:57.332 --> 08:04.887
Obviously, this means a lot to you, being a veteran and honoring your fellow veterans and hoping that people continue to do that.

08:05.322 --> 08:21.450
Tom, I can't say enough and I cannot do enough to help the veterans of past wars, nor can I do enough and will continue to try to do things for the veterans of the war that is going on now.

08:22.272 --> 08:28.242
There is nothing that we could ever do to repay somebody for a lost arm, a lost eye,

08:28.222 --> 08:29.144
or their life.

08:29.886 --> 08:34.315
And to these people I have nothing but the utmost respect.

08:34.375 --> 08:44.998
I have nothing but the desire to continue to honor these people who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms.

08:45.113 --> 08:46.835
You were born in Farmersville, Louisiana.

08:46.855 --> 08:49.778
You were the six of seven children of Clara and Oliver Cooper.

08:49.818 --> 08:54.163
And one of your brothers is a gentleman that people in the Brazos Valley knew very well.

08:54.183 --> 08:54.443
O.C.

08:54.463 --> 08:59.789
Cooper is your brother and one of the utmost also physicians here in this town.

08:59.809 --> 09:00.629
Talk about O.C.

09:00.649 --> 09:00.890
Cooper.

09:00.910 --> 09:01.931
You were very close to your brother.

09:02.291 --> 09:02.591
O.C.

09:02.632 --> 09:03.793
and I were very close.

09:03.853 --> 09:08.758
He was five years ahead of me in medical school, but was still remembered when I got there.

09:09.430 --> 09:17.926
And probably was the reason that I did go to medical school in that I was inclined more in the engineering area than in the medical area.

09:17.946 --> 09:20.090
But I went to visit him a couple of times.

09:20.912 --> 09:25.600
And after visiting him, then I had a burning desire to go to medical school.

09:25.661 --> 09:30.289
So I really give him the credit for getting me into medical school.

09:30.490 --> 09:30.730
Indeed.

09:30.929 --> 09:34.274
We've got a lot of pictures to show, so I want to get started with it.

09:34.294 --> 09:37.479
These are pictures that you supplied to us from your youth.

09:37.519 --> 09:42.947
We're going to take you all the way from when you were a kid in a football uniform and take you all the way up to the present.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.110
So let's go ahead and go to some of these pictures right there.

09:45.631 --> 09:47.293
Look at that head of hair, my goodness gracious.

09:47.313 --> 09:49.457
A lot of curly hair, a lot of curly hair.

09:49.597 --> 09:50.278
Yeah.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.922
I won't take my cap off now.

09:52.962 --> 09:54.384
To show people what's left of it.

09:54.524 --> 09:55.686
About how old were you in that picture?

09:56.107 --> 09:57.088
14.

09:57.068 --> 09:58.229
14 years old.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.753
That was in Carroll, Illinois, where I went to high school.

10:01.773 --> 10:03.095
Which is where you grew up.

10:03.115 --> 10:03.775
Part of the time.

10:03.795 --> 10:04.476
Part of the time.

10:04.496 --> 10:08.541
That was the Carroll, Illinois football team.

10:08.561 --> 10:10.803
All you got to do is look for the big head of hair, number 99.

10:10.883 --> 10:16.429
That was old 99, and oh, I was so bad then, it was unreal.

10:16.990 --> 10:20.313
The opposing teams just left the field when I came out.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.575
I bet you played every position.

10:21.935 --> 10:23.217
Well, not quite.

10:23.397 --> 10:24.318
Tackle and guard.

10:25.799 --> 10:26.400
Okay.

10:26.785 --> 10:27.446
Let's move on.

10:27.486 --> 10:29.127
Here's you and your brothers.

10:29.147 --> 10:35.875
There is OC on my right, Brian immediately to my right, and all three of us were in the armed forces.

10:35.955 --> 10:45.184
Brian was a Korean veteran and got a battlefield promotion in Korea, and I had just graduated from the Great Lakes Naval Training Center when that picture was made.

10:45.545 --> 10:45.665
Right.

10:45.685 --> 10:46.626
You're on the right, of course.

10:46.806 --> 10:47.827
Correct.

10:47.847 --> 10:48.748
In the Navy uniform.

10:49.109 --> 10:50.430
Okay.

10:50.410 --> 10:54.996
And here I am in the Pacific on the way back from Japan.

10:55.076 --> 11:10.815
That probably was in 1946 at some time, and there was a little storm behind us, but we were on the way anyway in an LST that was like being in a bathtub in the Pacific.

11:11.116 --> 11:18.308
There I am and this is why the Japanese collapsed because when they saw this picture and knew I was coming they just folded.

11:19.169 --> 11:21.112
They didn't really need to drop the atom bombs.

11:21.833 --> 11:29.766
They saw those leggings and they said... They saw me and it was dangerous to look at me.

11:29.746 --> 11:32.812
Oh, this is an interesting picture because you're a singer.

11:32.872 --> 11:34.575
You're seated on the far right.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.298
Talk about what was happening in this picture.

11:36.318 --> 11:49.663
Well, this was a group of Korean War veterans who were in the Naval Hospital at Bethesda, and I had been assigned the duty of taking them out to a country club on the edge of Washington.

11:49.703 --> 11:51.366
I think it was in Rockville.

11:51.346 --> 12:15.177
Maryland for them to have a little rest and recreation and the entertainer I can't remember who he was but he was playing the accordion obviously and we were all singing but I had my lips all puckered up whistling because I didn't sing too well I don't think an enjoyable day Richard Nixon came out as vice president and spoke to us that day I'll be darned

12:15.157 --> 12:17.279
and it was an enjoyable time.

12:17.799 --> 12:32.292
There's the APB-46, and it's built and looks just like a bathtub, and when it's underway, it rolls like a bathtub, and that was an LST that had been converted into a supply ship.

12:32.312 --> 12:45.163
Those big doors on the front opened, and one day I opened them, couldn't get them back together again, and we were getting ready to get underway, and it was sort of a shaky time there for a while, but we did get them closed again.

12:45.143 --> 12:47.648
Usually tanks came out of the front.

12:48.048 --> 12:49.812
That's the USS Admiral Benson.

12:49.832 --> 12:57.165
There were 5,000 of us on there, and in that typhoon, the waves were actually higher than those stacks.

12:57.186 --> 13:03.878
We would go down in between the waves and look up at the crest of the waves in the typhoon at Okinawa.

13:03.858 --> 13:05.962
A lot of fond memories on that ship.

13:06.162 --> 13:09.248
Travis Bryan and George Ferrari and I were on that ship together.

13:09.669 --> 13:10.530
Didn't know each other.

13:11.412 --> 13:12.093
I'll be darned.

13:12.113 --> 13:13.877
That was my conveyance to Japan.

13:14.598 --> 13:17.704
This is my intern class at Bethesda.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.609
That young lady in front there is Dr. Myrick.

13:20.689 --> 13:22.693
She was the very first.

13:22.673 --> 13:31.613
naval intern, female intern in the history of the Navy, and she did just a fine job.

13:31.753 --> 13:35.401
Most of those guys in that picture were World War II veterans.

13:35.441 --> 13:38.488
Some of them were ranked as high as lieutenant commander,

13:38.840 --> 13:43.387
came back in the Navy when we went back in as interns as Lieutenant J.G.

13:43.508 --> 13:49.377
So it was sort of an unusual thing to have been in World War II and then come back and serve again.

13:49.738 --> 13:51.741
And you're on the top row on the left there.

13:51.761 --> 13:53.584
Top left, I think.

13:53.604 --> 14:01.017
One of those fellows became the first officer on the first atomic submarine that the United States had.

14:01.778 --> 14:03.160
His name was Arnest.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.281
That's Mr. A.J.

14:04.341 --> 14:05.282
Foyt right there.

14:05.903 --> 14:06.023
Right.

14:06.043 --> 14:13.171
One thing we haven't talked about is that you served as the physician, the head physician at Texas World Speedway for several years, right?

14:13.511 --> 14:14.793
Still designated.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.593
Still designated.

14:15.714 --> 14:16.594
Head physician.

14:17.275 --> 14:28.287
Mr. Foyt had just backed into the wall doing 190 miles an hour out at Texas World Speedway, had crushed his helmet, and I had told him he couldn't drive in the next race

14:28.722 --> 14:34.793
He was obtaining permission to drive, did drive in the next race, came in second and didn't remember it.

14:36.055 --> 14:37.017
So I was right.

14:37.758 --> 14:40.663
And he wanted to get back on and you were having a difference of opinion.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.847
Oh, a big difference of opinion.

14:42.927 --> 14:44.270
I didn't want him to drive at all.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.311
Did you lose that argument?

14:45.432 --> 14:47.475
I lost the argument, big time.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.098
You don't win an argument with A.J.

14:49.118 --> 14:50.781
Floyd.

14:50.761 --> 14:55.486
That's in Bremerton, Washington, and that was made about 1998.

14:55.787 --> 15:04.616
That's the battleship New Jersey in the background there, the large ship, and there is a World War II carrier in the background.

15:04.676 --> 15:05.617
I don't know the name.

15:05.677 --> 15:12.405
I can't remember which one it was, but that's the battleship New Jersey to my left in the background.

15:12.425 --> 15:13.866
Beautiful ship, beautiful.

15:14.467 --> 15:17.190
It is now a museum in New Jersey.

15:17.913 --> 15:24.884
This is a group of people, and that's Rick Olivares, who is the present district commander of the VFW.

15:24.944 --> 15:33.136
That's Fred Brown, me, and Mickey Maley, and then that's Charles Opprestini, way in the background there, commander of the American Legion.

15:33.176 --> 15:41.449
And that was on, I think, 4th of July, Memorial Day, probably 2001 or so, at the VFW.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.532
All very dedicated people.

15:44.457 --> 16:00.183
Here's a guy that you might know, and those are my two children there who are now 24 and 25 years of age, and that's George Herman Bush there, number 41, and we were at the Memorial Student Center when that picture was made.

16:00.383 --> 16:00.704
I see.

16:01.105 --> 16:03.088
And I admire the man a great deal.

16:03.409 --> 16:03.729
Indeed.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.853
And see him frequently at the Bush Library.

16:05.893 --> 16:07.175
He's one of us now.

16:07.195 --> 16:09.739
Here we are at the Brazos Valley Veterans Memorial.

16:10.411 --> 16:13.994
Tom, that was at the memorial.

16:14.034 --> 16:18.959
I don't remember the date, but I'm pointing to my name that happens to be inscribed there.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.440
And O.C.'

16:20.420 --> 16:24.164
's name, my brother O.C., his name is there.

16:24.184 --> 16:29.368
And my brother-in-law, Colonel Howard Vestal's name, is on there twice.

16:29.548 --> 16:29.949
U.S.

16:29.969 --> 16:30.609
Army and U.S.

16:30.729 --> 16:31.230
Air Force.

16:31.730 --> 16:33.492
So I was pointing to my name.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.894
A beautiful, beautiful memorial.

16:36.034 --> 16:36.595
It is.

16:36.615 --> 16:39.017
Anybody who hasn't been out there, you need to be out there.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.852
Here's you and your brother, our final picture.

16:41.232 --> 16:44.355
Two brothers, and I love my brother O.C.

16:44.396 --> 16:44.796
dearly.

16:44.896 --> 16:49.121
We conferred frequently if we had different cases, I mean difficult cases.

16:49.261 --> 16:55.848
We were not in practice together in the same building, but we frequently conferred with each other.

16:56.829 --> 17:00.393
And I think he had the same love for me that I had for him.

17:00.413 --> 17:04.897
One of the finest physicians I have ever known, one of the kindest men I've ever known.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.122
Indeed, I had the pleasure of meeting him on a couple of occasions too.

17:10.250 --> 17:10.690
Indeed.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.833
A couple of fine guys right there.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.857
We talked about that you set up your practice in Bryan in 1955.

17:17.858 --> 17:19.620
How did you get to Bryan, Texas?

17:19.640 --> 17:20.041
O.C.

17:20.201 --> 17:26.908
had been sent here as a flight surgeon at the Bryan Air Force Base.

17:27.889 --> 17:33.456
When I got out of the Navy, I got out of the Navy before he got out of the Air Force and he asked me to come down.

17:33.516 --> 17:35.558
I came down and looked at Bryan.

17:35.578 --> 17:37.540
There had been a drought in the area.

17:37.891 --> 17:44.319
The ground was cracked open, the grass was brown, the trees were brown, and I said, my gosh, who would live here?

17:44.999 --> 17:47.603
I went to Portland, Oregon, set up a practice.

17:47.623 --> 17:53.830
It rained 365 days, and I immediately came back to the cracked brown ground.

17:53.850 --> 17:54.911
And have been here ever since.

17:54.971 --> 17:55.512
Ever since.

17:55.652 --> 17:58.836
And this is over 50 years ago, so I guess you...

17:59.238 --> 18:04.705
You delivered babies of people who have babies now, right?

18:04.905 --> 18:12.235
There are people that I delivered who do have babies and who do come to me as adults.

18:12.255 --> 18:19.204
And there is a physician in Bryan, and I won't call his name because he might be embarrassed, who I did deliver.

18:19.488 --> 18:21.073
when I first came to Brighton.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.906
And you're still practicing, you're still practicing every day.

18:25.488 --> 18:30.665
So obviously there's a love, there's a passion there that makes you get up and go to help people every day.

18:30.725 --> 18:31.287
Talk about

18:31.840 --> 18:32.621
Talk about why.

18:32.641 --> 18:37.326
You're nearly 80 years old, and a lot of people would say, well, why hasn't old Doc Cooper retired?

18:37.766 --> 18:38.927
Why hasn't Doc Cooper retired?

18:38.987 --> 18:49.097
Tom, as long as I have any intelligence, and I hope somebody will tell me when I don't, I will quit, and I still do an adult general practice.

18:49.117 --> 18:52.521
I don't go to the hospital, and I do a lot of aviation medicine.

18:53.021 --> 18:58.887
As a matter of fact, I did three Southwest Airline pilot physicals this morning.

18:58.907 --> 19:00.649
These guys are all...

19:00.629 --> 19:06.122
war veterans themselves, believe it or not, and then they came back and started flying for Southwest Airlines.

19:06.142 --> 19:08.648
But I love the practice of medicine.

19:08.668 --> 19:12.337
I love helping people, and I hope I can continue for a while.

19:12.357 --> 19:13.861
I want to talk about that some more.

19:13.921 --> 19:17.710
You're an FAA, Senior Aviation Medical Examiner.

19:18.196 --> 19:27.412
Talk about sort of how you got that appointment and how that became that, because you're one of the few, I guess, in town that if somebody wants to renew their license, they got to come to you for the physical.

19:27.432 --> 19:39.113
There are two of us who are senior examiners in town, but I think that I do the preponderance of first-class physicals, which the airline pilots must have to fly.

19:39.193 --> 19:39.934
They have...

19:39.914 --> 19:58.902
a physical every six months and Dr. Henry Harrison who was both a doctor of veterinary medicine and an MD was an aviation medical examiner here in Bryan and he is the one who encouraged me to go ahead and become an aviation medical examiner and

19:58.882 --> 20:08.884
Through the years, you have to take special courses in both aviation physiology and federal air regulations to keep up, and that's what I've done.

20:08.924 --> 20:13.874
I've kept up now for 47 years, starting on my 48th year.

20:13.894 --> 20:14.416
My goodness.

20:14.636 --> 20:17.903
One of the most senior examiners in the United States now.

20:18.490 --> 20:21.293
There was one thing that happened, I know, in your experience in the war.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.676
I believe you were on the Bennington at the time.

20:24.457 --> 20:34.689
You weren't on the Bennington, but there was an explosion on the Bennington that killed some 103 people and severely burned a lot, and you were involved in the treatment of those.

20:34.709 --> 20:43.920
The USS Bennington aircraft carrier was off the Rhode Island coast in 1953, and they had hydraulic catapults.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.662
The catapult was leaking.

20:45.642 --> 20:52.252
Fumes got into the ventilation system and exploded for some reason that I don't know why.

20:53.114 --> 20:55.518
And 107 people were killed.

20:55.578 --> 21:02.048
Both doctors were killed and we got 250 or 60 severely burned patients.

21:02.028 --> 21:09.564
at the Newport Naval Hospital where I was not stationed, but they called me off the ship to come there and help with these burned people.

21:09.584 --> 21:13.793
250 severely burned patients within about five hours.

21:14.414 --> 21:22.872
The one time I wished that I was somewhere else and did not relish that time that I spent there, but it had to be done.

21:23.122 --> 21:27.890
The VFW, we touched on that a moment ago, and you're a past commander of the local VFW here.

21:27.930 --> 21:29.512
That's something that I know that you support.

21:29.572 --> 21:32.918
Talk a little bit about the VFW, sort of some of the things they do.

21:32.978 --> 21:44.196
The people are involved, and I know that you want more people involved with the VFW, younger people, veterans coming through, because the folks that are sort of keeping it going right now, they're not going to be able to be doing that forever.

21:44.296 --> 21:46.159
So you need new blood in the VFW.

21:46.139 --> 21:52.148
I'm a good example of the folks that we need to replace in that I'm 80 years old.

21:52.168 --> 22:02.663
The VFW has a lot of civic programs such as we sponsor kids who do essays in high school.

22:02.743 --> 22:09.554
They also have a program called the Voice of Democracy where they write speeches that they give.

22:10.475 --> 22:14.661
And I was at the national meeting several years ago and

22:14.641 --> 22:23.560
The young man who won the national championship got a $75,000 scholarship for winning the national championship.

22:23.580 --> 22:24.862
So it's a good thing.

22:24.882 --> 22:29.552
We do a lot of other civic work that is too detailed to go into right now.

22:29.572 --> 22:31.456
And I know that you all have great ceremonies.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.240
You did this past July the 4th.

22:33.558 --> 22:37.589
Memorial Day, Veterans Day, July the 4th, you do it up big.

22:37.990 --> 22:48.618
We try to honor the present and the past veterans and certainly keep the memories alive for the people who have sacrificed for this country, yes.

22:48.638 --> 22:50.082
Jim, talk about your family.

22:50.062 --> 22:54.352
I have six children.

22:54.472 --> 22:59.564
I have a son 58 years old who is in Singapore right now.

22:59.584 --> 23:08.745
He sells sound equipment and incidentally the sound equipment in Kyle Field happens to be manufactured by Meijer Sound and that's what he does.

23:08.725 --> 23:12.309
I then have two daughters.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.892
One is working with the Chamber of Commerce in Waco.

23:16.413 --> 23:19.536
Another works here at the Presbyterian Church running the nursery.

23:20.377 --> 23:27.925
I have two other sons, one who's getting ready to go to Stanford graduate school in September.

23:28.525 --> 23:34.111
I have one son who is deceased and another son who is a motion picture cameraman.

23:34.131 --> 23:37.855
And they all succeeded in spite of their father.

23:37.835 --> 23:50.795
And my wife Connie, present wife Connie, did work in the healthcare industry but she now has sort of semi-retired and she told me I had to keep working.

23:50.815 --> 23:55.482
Well I think some of those kids in school that you talked about that might be another reason why you go to work every day.

23:55.622 --> 23:58.386
It does stimulate you when you have two kids in college.

23:58.707 --> 24:01.931
There are no graduates of A&M.

24:02.933 --> 24:05.597
My wife graduated from A&M and

24:05.577 --> 24:10.884
But they've been all over Baylor, University of Texas, Texas State.

24:11.064 --> 24:13.327
So I don't know.

24:14.228 --> 24:20.796
I guess they all became tired of living in Bryan College Station and wanted to see the world.

24:21.056 --> 24:21.517
Right.

24:21.537 --> 24:22.618
So they went to other schools.

24:23.019 --> 24:24.981
Jim Cooper, you've seen war.

24:25.001 --> 24:30.548
You've seen war from the standpoint of a physician, which has seen really the horror of war, too.

24:31.049 --> 24:34.453
And I know you have thoughts about war, about conflict.

24:34.923 --> 24:37.486
and your hope that it can be avoided.

24:37.506 --> 24:39.127
Try to voice those in the couple of minutes we have left.

24:39.147 --> 24:44.693
Tom, war is no way to settle international problems.

24:45.254 --> 24:49.618
Problems that are settled by war are settled in a horrific manner.

24:49.918 --> 24:51.560
Nobody wins.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.824
And certainly the mediation table is the way to go.

24:56.425 --> 25:03.192
And certainly we should teach our kids to learn to come to the mediation table to try to work out

25:03.172 --> 25:06.237
both conflicts at home and abroad.

25:06.257 --> 25:20.904
And war is devastating in all aspects, both in human sacrifices, in geographical sacrifices, in structural sacrifices, and there are no winners, really, in any war that has ever occurred.

25:20.924 --> 25:22.587
There are victors, but no winners.

25:22.867 --> 25:25.652
They're all losers, any way you look at it.

25:26.037 --> 25:33.368
I know I've had the pleasure to meet a lot of veterans through my friendship with you, which has been going on now for about three or four years.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.312
I happen to be your physician too, Tom.

25:36.332 --> 25:37.454
You're also my doctor.

25:38.756 --> 25:39.837
He's so healthy looking.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.181
That's right.

25:42.622 --> 25:44.865
And this man is one of the reasons for that.

25:44.985 --> 25:47.108
And Jim, thank you for your service.

25:47.128 --> 25:53.057
And thank you, not only your service in the military, but your service to people in the Brazos Valley over the last 50 years.

25:53.273 --> 25:58.021
incredible that what you've done over the last 50 years and that you're still doing it, keeping people healthy.

25:58.041 --> 26:02.528
And I know that you enjoy doing it and you want to keep doing it as long as you can, right?

26:02.749 --> 26:05.994
Tom, I'd like to go another 50 years, at least.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.157
But I have enjoyed it.

26:08.178 --> 26:13.987
And I thank the people of Bryan and Brazos County for allowing me the privilege to practice medicine here.

26:14.288 --> 26:14.748
Indeed.

26:14.768 --> 26:16.231
Thank you very much for your service.

26:16.251 --> 26:20.057
And thank you for coming back and sort of commemorating our first show.

26:20.392 --> 26:23.137
You're our 75th veteran, and we hope to keep on going here.

26:23.438 --> 26:29.489
It's been an extreme pleasure, and I hope the show continues to be successful.

26:29.509 --> 26:31.031
You've done a great job.

26:31.051 --> 26:36.141
You've exposed the community to a lot of veterans who deserve having the exposure.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.405
Well, the star of the show is the veterans themselves like you.

26:38.505 --> 26:39.867
Thank you very much, Jim Cooper.

26:39.928 --> 26:40.729
I appreciate it.

26:41.873 --> 26:49.701
30 months ago, I chose Dr. Jim Cooper as our very first guest on Veterans of the Valley because of his personal passion for those who have served and do serve.

26:50.182 --> 26:54.606
For more than a half century, he has been healing and mending folks right here in the Brazos Valley.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.349
And at age 80, well, there's no end in sight.

26:57.469 --> 27:01.774
We salute Dr. Jim Cooper for his service to our country and to our community.

27:02.114 --> 27:06.919
And a special thanks to the Youth Adventure Program sponsored by the College of Education

27:06.899 --> 27:09.109
and for their help on today's program.

27:09.551 --> 27:10.495
I'm Tom Turbeville.

27:10.676 --> 27:12.825
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
