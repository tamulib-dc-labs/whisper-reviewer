00:30.148 --> 00:32.428
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.808 --> 00:33.970
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.726 --> 00:41.772
John Anderson is quick to tell you that his year-long service in Vietnam was not frontline duty, no direct combat.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.695
He even goes so far as to call his job an easy one.

00:44.715 --> 00:48.178
But after hearing his story, I really can't agree, and I doubt if you will.

00:48.778 --> 00:59.007
John Anderson did not fly the gunships, but he flew above them in his 01 Bird Dog single-engine aircraft, guiding them, identifying landing zones and areas to attack.

00:59.027 --> 01:03.231
Nonetheless, John Anderson counts himself fortunate to have come home from Vietnam alive,

01:03.532 --> 01:04.894
and you'll understand why.

01:04.914 --> 01:05.655
John, welcome.

01:05.675 --> 01:07.638
I've been wanting to have you on this show for a long time.

01:07.678 --> 01:12.025
You have led me to a lot of veterans, and finally, I get you on the show.

01:12.626 --> 01:13.867
You served in Vietnam.

01:14.108 --> 01:25.345
You talk about that your job was not as combative as other jobs, but still, you do count yourself lucky to have come home from Vietnam because there were near misses in your service.

01:25.365 --> 01:25.645
Oh, yes.

01:25.925 --> 01:26.266
Oh, yes.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.047
It was very interesting.

01:28.009 --> 01:28.509
Talk about them.

01:29.351 --> 01:30.973
Well, if

01:31.510 --> 01:33.873
To know what I went through, you'd have to know what I did.

01:33.953 --> 01:37.197
And I flew that 01 Bird Dog, which was an observation plane.

01:37.217 --> 01:41.042
It's a Cessna with a lot more power than the old L-19.

01:42.003 --> 01:48.171
And my job was to work with either naval gunfire or artillery or infantry on occasion.

01:49.092 --> 01:52.236
But it evolved that my main job was

01:52.537 --> 02:02.694
I believe, getting Americans out of trouble, working with the Charlie Company 75th Rangers a lot my last six months, and working with a unit called the First of the 50th Mechanized.

02:04.097 --> 02:14.815
And in doing that, I witnessed a lot of fascinating things, educational things, as to what people are capable of doing when they're challenged.

02:15.723 --> 02:23.575
If you had an American in trouble, you had more help than you knew what to do with, because everybody wanted to help out.

02:23.595 --> 02:34.551
In fact, talking about working with the Rangers, and you talked about identifying landing zones, I watched a helicopter piloted by a man called Haas Cartwright.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.614
He had a big handlebar mustache.

02:36.654 --> 02:37.495
He was a big guy.

02:37.996 --> 02:39.058
His last name was Cartwright.

02:39.138 --> 02:42.743
Bonanza was popular in those days, so we called him Haas.

02:43.060 --> 02:52.115
He flew a UH-1 hotel or Delta model, I can't recall which, and we would load these Rangers onto the helicopters.

02:52.355 --> 03:05.136
We'd have some gunships or not, depending on what we were doing or where we were, and he would land, or the helicopter pilot would land in a succession of landing zones, and they were flying at treetop level,

03:05.926 --> 03:12.942
So I couldn't fly over them and give away their position, and they couldn't see the landing zones.

03:12.962 --> 03:23.968
So I'd give them headings and count off the meters as they were approaching the landing zone, and they would go into each one, and at a prearranged landing zone, they would let the rangers out.

03:24.826 --> 03:36.018
Well, the North Vietnamese, for their part, being fairly smart, whenever they would come to a rest position, they would set up around the landing zone just in case Americans happened to land there.

03:36.298 --> 03:39.762
So we've got triple canopy jungle and then these clearings.

03:39.782 --> 03:42.364
And one day, Haas put a team on the ground.

03:43.506 --> 03:44.266
He took off.

03:44.727 --> 03:47.410
The North Vietnamese would always wait until the helicopter took off.

03:48.511 --> 03:50.873
And they had set up around this landing zone.

03:50.893 --> 03:54.377
And they opened up on the six-man team of rangers.

03:54.357 --> 03:59.323
We call them long range reconnaissance patrol, or LERPs.

03:59.343 --> 04:08.535
As that happened and as Cartwright was coming out of the LZ, he took at least one round through his main rotor blade, which set up a vibration that was pretty interesting to handle.

04:09.777 --> 04:17.227
And at that point, instead of flying away, he made that helicopter do something I have never seen before since.

04:17.247 --> 04:23.655
He did the tightest, steepest turn I've ever seen in a helicopter, and he did it at low level.

04:23.703 --> 04:31.530
right over those trees and came back into the landing zone and sat there on the ground until every one of those rangers got on board.

04:31.630 --> 04:35.113
You could see tracers coming out of the tree line flying by these guys.

04:35.133 --> 04:39.177
You know that there's four rounds, four bullets for every tracer you see.

04:39.937 --> 04:43.100
But he sat on the ground until everybody got on board and then took off.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.783
And it's the single bravest thing I've ever witnessed.

04:45.803 --> 04:46.423
Indeed.

04:46.443 --> 04:50.086
And that's just one of the fascinating stories that you came back from Vietnam with.

04:50.567 --> 04:51.988
A lot of them involved yourself.

04:52.323 --> 04:56.867
I want to go back a little bit, talk about your first joining the Army.

04:56.887 --> 04:58.829
You joined pretty much straight out of college.

04:58.849 --> 05:00.010
Went to Texas Western.

05:00.350 --> 05:03.053
You were in school there when they won the NCAA basketball championship.

05:03.073 --> 05:06.095
I certainly was, and so was Ann, but we didn't know each other at that time.

05:06.115 --> 05:08.297
My wife, Ann, we met later on.

05:08.478 --> 05:10.599
You married your wife, Ann, in 1966.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.521
You've been married nearly 39 years.

05:12.982 --> 05:13.742
That's right.

05:14.123 --> 05:17.706
She was an Army wife, and she was home when you were serving in Vietnam.

05:17.866 --> 05:22.330
We didn't talk about this earlier, but that had to have been very difficult for you and her.

05:22.310 --> 05:22.891
It was.

05:23.692 --> 05:25.775
Any separation is difficult.

05:25.795 --> 05:36.792
Separation under those circumstances is extremely difficult, and that's why I feel so for the troops that are serving now in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I have in every conflict we've sent people to.

05:37.853 --> 05:44.503
I also left a nine-month-old son, and he was 21 months when I got back, and that was a tough thing to do.

05:44.838 --> 05:46.541
Fortunately, you came home to a 21-month-old son.

05:46.581 --> 05:47.863
That's right.

05:47.883 --> 05:48.865
And that's good.

05:48.905 --> 05:51.630
Your training in Georgia, you went to Fort Rucker, went to Fort Stewart.

05:51.750 --> 05:52.792
You learned how to fly.

05:52.812 --> 06:09.782
I learned how to fly, initially fixed-wing training, initial entry fixed-wing at Fort Stewart, Georgia, for four months, and then to Fort Rucker for four months, and came out with a single-engine land, multi-engine instrument rated, and was glad to have it.

06:10.117 --> 06:16.428
You had some experiences before you ever got to Vietnam that nearly never got you to Vietnam.

06:17.329 --> 06:19.713
Talk about some of your early flying experiences.

06:19.773 --> 06:24.401
Well, I was technically, I guess you could call them crashes, but I was in two incidents.

06:24.541 --> 06:35.500
One in ROTC flight training in school where my lack of experience helped me to run off the runway into some sand and stand the plane up on its nose.

06:35.480 --> 06:43.730
The other one was in flight school, flying with my what you call stick buddy, Bobby Beale, who in fact tried to kill me three times.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.515
But this day, he was doing a really bad landing.

06:48.535 --> 06:56.485
It was a beautiful spring day, and I had my elbow on the windowsill of the plane, the back seat, because it's a pilot sits in the front and observer in the back.

06:57.526 --> 07:01.791
And he rounded out about 10 feet too high and fell in and bounced.

07:02.463 --> 07:07.888
And then the engine caught, and instead of going around, he closed the throttle again and bounced again up even higher.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.172
And finally, the third time, he was about 30 feet in the air.

07:11.192 --> 07:17.217
And when he came down, I looked at the left wing tip, and I thought, boy, that's awfully close to the ground, and this is a really bad landing.

07:18.339 --> 07:28.348
And he got it straightened out, heading on the ground, broke ground like he was going to take off finally, heading for a tree line of 60-foot pine trees.

07:29.229 --> 07:32.132
And as I looked over his shoulder, I noticed that we weren't climbing.

07:33.023 --> 07:34.753
and the trees were coming up fast.

07:34.773 --> 07:40.806
And I looked out of the corner of my eye and here were 60 degrees of flaps on that bird dog retarding our climb.

07:41.478 --> 07:43.180
So I said, Bob, bring up your flaps.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.202
Not all of them, just half.

07:44.722 --> 07:46.905
And I watched to make sure he stopped at the takeoff setting.

07:47.807 --> 07:48.628
And we went around.

07:49.629 --> 07:52.873
And Bob said, John, I'm terrified.

07:53.975 --> 07:57.179
And I said, well, Bob, would you like me to land this from the back seat?

07:57.660 --> 07:59.803
And he thought a moment and said, I'm not that terrified.

08:00.884 --> 08:01.885
So it came in and landed.

08:02.366 --> 08:08.414
And I found out after we landed that we had put the wing tip a foot into the ground, should have cartwheeled.

08:09.315 --> 08:11.198
But it cut cleanly through the ground.

08:11.836 --> 08:16.544
And that until we got to the tree line, people on the ground could see trees above our aircraft.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.848
And that's when the flaps came up and we cleared the trees.

08:18.988 --> 08:20.791
You must have thought Vietnam's going to be a breeze.

08:20.991 --> 08:21.472
Sure.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.295
If you could go through this.

08:23.315 --> 08:23.696
That's right.

08:24.056 --> 08:26.901
You went jungle training in the Philippines before you went to Vietnam.

08:26.921 --> 08:27.943
Talk about what was involved.

08:27.963 --> 08:29.946
Yeah, that was Jungle Survival School.

08:30.888 --> 08:36.477
And they taught us what we could eat and what we couldn't and taught us how to trap water to drink.

08:36.457 --> 08:43.007
and we made our own hammocks out of parachutes and heard all this noise.

08:43.088 --> 08:45.391
We thought it was people walking around at night in the jungle.

08:45.411 --> 08:50.199
Turns out it's rats, and the jungle is full of rats, so it's not a vacation spot necessarily.

08:52.202 --> 08:59.854
But they had people looking for us, and you had to try and keep from getting caught, and it was an interesting training.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.460
I think it prepared us pretty well in case anything happened in country.

09:03.507 --> 09:04.549
And then you went in country.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.313
Where exactly did you go initially?

09:07.333 --> 09:08.034
Where were you stationed?

09:08.054 --> 09:09.737
Well, they have an interesting process.

09:09.777 --> 09:13.883
You go into the Long Bend replacement depot.

09:15.005 --> 09:31.590
And I got assigned to the 1st Aviation Brigade, which assigned me to the 17th Group in the Trang, which assigned me the 223rd Battalion in Quinlan, which assigned me to the 183rd Reconnaissance Aviation Company at Phan Thiet, or actually at Dongpatian across the bay from Camelon.

09:32.043 --> 09:35.505
which assigned me to the second flight platoon at Phan Thiet.

09:36.464 --> 09:38.047
And Phan Thiet is on the coast.

09:38.988 --> 09:46.921
It's a coastal plain about 20 miles deep, and then mountains that range upwards of a little over 5,000 feet, and triple canopy jungle in the valley.

09:47.982 --> 09:50.546
And the Nook Mam capital of the world.

09:50.927 --> 09:54.873
It's a Vietnamese sauce made from very deceased fish.

09:55.915 --> 09:59.881
And it smells really bad when it's being made, but it's good to eat.

09:59.901 --> 10:02.185
Tastes better than the description of how to make it.

10:03.397 --> 10:15.615
Talk a little bit more specifically about what your job was in the bird dog so people will really understand exactly what your mission was and how you helped out other pilots.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.279
Well, primarily it was reconnaissance.

10:18.299 --> 10:23.987
That was the number one job, looking for the enemy wherever we were assigned to look.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.814
I did a lot of naval gunfire support.

10:27.854 --> 10:36.106
I'd fly a marine or navy person in the back seat, and we'd adjust the ship's gunfire where they could reach inland.

10:36.126 --> 10:46.040
I worked with the artillery batteries to help them register, and then I would fire artillery when there was an event that called for attacking the enemy with artillery.

10:46.060 --> 10:49.485
I worked with, like I said, the 1st to 50th Mechanized.

10:49.465 --> 11:16.924
My job, since they make a lot of noise and aren't going to surprise anybody, was to fire artillery in front of them and set off any mines that might be there. You'd get secondary explosions after your artillery round went off and that would indicate that there were mines in there. I got used to working with them a lot, and then the most interesting job really was the was the rangers the 75th rangers. That led to a lot of interesting events because their job was to go out into that

11:17.157 --> 11:23.146
mountainous area into the triple canopy, 300 foot tall tree jungle, and find North Vietnamese.

11:24.048 --> 11:38.490
And our job was to help them go in, to help them when they were there in case they lost communications or got in trouble, got jumped by a larger force, which happened all too often, and then to help them get out.

11:38.470 --> 11:56.293
and I would either use gunships to help get them out if they were in contact or I had one occasion in particular, I was called on to fire artillery that we had moved a battery on top of a mountain and of 105 millimeter artillery.

11:56.932 --> 12:01.237
And this six-man LERP team was running from North Vietnamese.

12:01.338 --> 12:07.585
They'd gotten outnumbered and were being chased, running full tilt through the jungle.

12:07.605 --> 12:12.712
And my job was to call artillery on the Vietnamese, on the North Vietnamese.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.613
But I couldn't see anybody.

12:13.753 --> 12:14.594
I couldn't see the Americans.

12:14.854 --> 12:15.876
I couldn't see the Vietnamese.

12:16.897 --> 12:26.449
So I would call the artillery between the North Vietnamese and the Americans, and I would figure that it was between because the LERPs would tell me

12:27.003 --> 12:52.302
by the shrapnel coming through the trees if I was getting too close to them, and it was a situation when you're firing artillery close to US troops it's it's very it can scare you. Uh most frightened I've ever been was when I used the wrong gun target line and thought I'd landed too close to some troops with an eight inch gun, but uh that'll ruin your whole day, but in this case

12:52.282 --> 12:56.351
Because you know you're firing close to Americans.

12:56.371 --> 12:58.896
You first give the command to the artillery battery, danger.

12:58.916 --> 13:01.843
And then when it's really close, you say danger close.

13:01.863 --> 13:05.711
And that's the way it was this whole time until they got to an LZ and got picked up.

13:05.731 --> 13:10.020
And that I count as a singular event helping those guys get out of trouble.

13:10.692 --> 13:19.243
You flew your aircraft not directly over the targets so as to not give away the location, and you also flew about 1,000 feet above the trees mostly.

13:19.344 --> 13:26.533
So you were essentially out of harm's way because you were too far up for the enemy to shoot at you normally.

13:26.553 --> 13:30.118
But sometimes you did get down there, I guess, because of cloud cover, right?

13:30.368 --> 13:40.863
Well, cloud cover or if we were looking for something in particular, sometimes you can't see from above what what you're looking for.

13:40.883 --> 13:47.191
I could tell from a thousand feet, for example, after a while you become trained to where you can pick things out, your eyes get better.

13:48.013 --> 13:56.224
And I could tell from a thousand feet up if a trail had been used in the last little while just by the difference in color.

13:57.082 --> 13:58.364
And then we could drop down.

13:58.424 --> 14:04.713
Now, understand, again, I told you this before, there's a difference between courage and confidence.

14:05.394 --> 14:08.118
I didn't have a lot of courage, but I developed a lot of confidence.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.143
And you might call it being young and stupid, too.

14:11.664 --> 14:17.172
But I could drop my flaps and fly that plane very slowly.

14:17.192 --> 14:22.319
And we would fly over a trail where we'd seen that somebody had been there.

14:22.380 --> 14:25.384
One particular case, an American had been killed by a sniper.

14:26.275 --> 14:33.283
And we were looking for the guy and we followed this trail by the back seater looking to see which direction the footprints went.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.085
And so you had to get down pretty low to do that.

14:35.906 --> 14:41.112
But again, I didn't, as long as I was inside my airplane, I didn't feel threatened.

14:41.132 --> 14:44.036
So it didn't matter how low or how high it was.

14:44.196 --> 14:45.537
And that's where the confidence came in.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.602
You brought some pictures with you and I want to go to some of those.

14:49.642 --> 14:53.987
We're gonna close in on some of the pictures to sort of give people an idea.

14:54.305 --> 14:57.889
First off, you can look right there at that monitor right over there, and you can see the first picture.

14:57.929 --> 15:01.414
That is you, and what are we looking at?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.797
I'm in training there at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

15:05.258 --> 15:16.712
By that time, I believe I'm a first lieutenant, and that may have even been the day where the wives came out to watch us land and take off over a string barrier with pennants hanging down.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.034
So that was the...

15:18.267 --> 15:19.788
And that's the bird dog.

15:19.849 --> 15:20.930
That's the bird dog right there.

15:21.370 --> 15:26.975
That's what you were trained to fly the last part of your training and that you flew your entire tour of Vietnam.

15:27.015 --> 15:28.036
That's correct.

15:28.056 --> 15:28.797
OK.

15:28.817 --> 15:29.758
And go to another picture.

15:30.078 --> 15:30.218
OK.

15:30.238 --> 15:32.260
That's the ocean in the background.

15:32.280 --> 15:37.906
And that's the one end of the runway is right below that picture.

15:38.366 --> 15:39.868
And that hangar is our hangar.

15:40.808 --> 15:44.612
And the building you see to the left was where I lived the first six months I was there.

15:45.082 --> 15:48.246
It's an old French post.

15:49.208 --> 15:53.413
And we had running water, no heat, but running water.

15:53.433 --> 15:54.615
So I took a lot of cold showers.

15:54.835 --> 16:01.123
And those are revetments made out of 55-gallon oil drums that we parked the aircraft in that are surrounding the hangar.

16:01.144 --> 16:03.787
In fact, there is an aircraft there in that one revetment.

16:03.807 --> 16:04.868
It's an Air Force O2.

16:06.531 --> 16:07.512
How was all of this built?

16:08.622 --> 16:09.984
Yeah, who built?

16:10.544 --> 16:11.586
Most of that was built by the French.

16:11.706 --> 16:12.987
That was built by the French, okay.

16:14.209 --> 16:16.551
And you see that red cross there, that's the dust off pad.

16:16.852 --> 16:17.092
Right.

16:17.232 --> 16:24.321
Because after I left there, they moved an aid station into that building, and that's where we take wounded.

16:24.341 --> 16:24.641
Okay.

16:25.862 --> 16:26.723
What are we looking at here?

16:26.743 --> 16:28.025
That's a typical fire base.

16:28.045 --> 16:29.787
I believe that was a 105 battery.

16:30.425 --> 16:35.512
of artillery, usually six tubes of 105 millimeter artillery.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.558
And that's out in the middle of that coastal plain somewhere.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.782
I don't know which one that was.

16:41.822 --> 16:46.989
We had about three 105 batteries and one battery that was a combination of eight inch and 175.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.233
Now you took this picture from your program?

16:49.253 --> 16:49.513
Yes.

16:54.691 --> 16:55.352
Christmas time.

16:55.612 --> 17:05.303
There's Christmas in Vietnam, and we had a little beach party, and the man on the right was the platoon leader at the time.

17:05.323 --> 17:12.772
He was a captain, Billy J. Seay, S-E-A-Y, and he had been an NCO with the 1st Infantry Division his first tour.

17:13.453 --> 17:20.742
So this was his second exposure to Vietnam, and that's me sitting on the little boat looking a lot thinner than I look today.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.685
Not that much.

17:23.665 --> 17:45.994
but that was uh that was Christmas away from home so you tried to get as many smiles as you could. Oh yeah we we smiled a lot you you. People can do that even under difficult circumstances they can make let humor and good times uh relieves the stress. Final picture, this is a picture that we think that someone else took and that that indeed

17:46.227 --> 17:46.748
Could be you.

17:46.768 --> 17:47.689
It's been a long time.

17:47.729 --> 17:48.531
It's been a long time.

17:49.132 --> 17:51.896
That's what the bird dog looked like flying.

17:51.916 --> 17:52.437
That's right.

17:53.599 --> 17:59.809
The reason we think that that's my bird dog in the background is because that's not my camera that took that picture.

18:00.751 --> 18:00.871
Right.

18:00.891 --> 18:06.660
And somebody would have given that to me to take home.

18:06.680 --> 18:10.767
In the right side of that picture, you see the back end of a...

18:11.050 --> 18:37.547
rocket tube. My bird dogs were armed with four 2.75 inch white phosphorus rockets and we use them for marking the targets two under each wing. Wow fascinating pictures thank you for bringing those. Um you talked about I think the first time you went up in vietnam I believe you got shot at. Oh yeah. And you weren't really sure that you were what what exactly it was. Tell that story. Well it was a first flight in our province

18:37.527 --> 18:42.113
And a Marine first lieutenant who was an ancient guy, he was all at 30 years old.

18:42.674 --> 18:43.876
So we thought he was really old.

18:44.897 --> 18:47.841
He took me out into the area to fire naval gunfire.

18:48.783 --> 18:52.368
And on the way out, he said, I think there's a guy in this big bush down there.

18:52.388 --> 18:56.714
And the bush was about 30 feet across and 30 feet tall.

18:56.734 --> 19:02.182
So being the fresh out of flight school guy I was, I knew how to bring the plane down and fly around the bush.

19:03.063 --> 19:06.808
And sure enough, I saw the guy and I heard this noise and I didn't recognize the noise.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.281
It was a clattering sound.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.085
And I went around the bush and it stopped.

19:11.105 --> 19:14.049
And as I came back around the side where the guy was, I heard the noise again.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.491
And I thought, what's wrong with my airplane?

19:15.511 --> 19:17.954
I looked at the gauges and couldn't see anything wrong.

19:18.915 --> 19:20.557
Came back around one more time.

19:21.318 --> 19:27.326
And I thought, when I heard that noise again, I thought, Larry Doak is pulling a trick on a rookie.

19:27.346 --> 19:28.848
This is something they do to all the new guys.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.293
And I turned around and looked at him in the backseat.

19:32.513 --> 19:34.135
And I said, what is that noise?

19:34.215 --> 19:37.099
And he was sitting there with his feet on the floor and his hands in his lap.

19:37.670 --> 19:42.315
calmly looking out the window, and we were probably about 50 feet above the ground.

19:43.076 --> 19:44.798
And he said, you idiot, we're getting shot at.

19:45.699 --> 19:47.481
And that was an AK-47 shooting at us.

19:47.842 --> 19:48.843
And that's what it sounded like.

19:48.863 --> 19:49.564
That's what it sounded like.

19:49.584 --> 19:50.144
First time you'd heard it.

19:50.164 --> 19:50.865
First time I'd heard it.

19:50.885 --> 19:51.986
But you probably didn't forget it.

19:52.227 --> 19:52.667
I remembered.

19:52.687 --> 19:53.628
I can still hear it.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.010
You can still hear it.

19:55.691 --> 20:01.197
One of the fascinating stories that you told me was about a mission that ended up

20:01.818 --> 20:08.047
Ended up a lot better than it could have, and you know which one I'm talking about, where you had to do a little wrestling with a parachute and a flare.

20:08.267 --> 20:08.668
That's right.

20:09.229 --> 20:12.453
Talk about how that developed and how it came out.

20:12.473 --> 20:16.619
Well, one night, and I did a lot of night flying, and I enjoyed flying at night.

20:18.261 --> 20:29.918
I was the alert pilot, and I was called out to help a place where either a Vietnamese National Guard or Army of Vietnam compound had been hit,

20:30.725 --> 20:32.047
and taken some casualties.

20:32.728 --> 20:36.012
And we were trying to get the North Vietnamese that had hit them.

20:37.153 --> 20:44.202
And we had an Air Force gunship, a C-119 gunship with a 20 millimeter Vulcan Gatling gun.

20:45.003 --> 20:50.610
And they were flying about 4,500 feet and flying north of the highway.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.212
And I was flying south of the highway.

20:52.232 --> 20:54.395
We did racetrack patterns.

20:54.415 --> 20:55.796
And they were kicking out flares.

20:55.816 --> 20:58.740
And even with the flares, they couldn't see the ground, but I could.

20:59.497 --> 21:05.285
And I could actually adjust their fire by telling them how far off the target they were.

21:05.986 --> 21:07.228
And the target was screen beds.

21:07.248 --> 21:14.718
And we figured the enemy would use the screen beds to hide their movement as they went back north to the mountains to escape.

21:14.738 --> 21:26.534
Well, I didn't realize it, but they had kicked out an extra flare south of the highway so that a dust off helicopter could go in and pick up the wounded.

21:26.554 --> 21:29.318
And of course, these things were burning out above my altitude.

21:30.412 --> 21:32.054
And I remember looking out to the right.

21:32.154 --> 21:34.297
I was flying west at the time.

21:35.238 --> 21:41.526
Looking out to the right and looking in front of me just in time to see a white blur in front of my nose.

21:42.428 --> 21:44.470
And it's one of those things where it's instant recognition.

21:44.490 --> 21:45.952
You don't have to think the words.

21:46.092 --> 21:46.994
You just know what it is.

21:47.995 --> 21:52.120
And I hit right rudder and right aileron as hard as I could to try to turn away.

21:52.140 --> 21:56.025
And not being the bravest guy in the world, I actually flinched.

21:56.045 --> 21:58.849
And I sort of closed my eyes and turned my head to the right.

21:59.656 --> 22:06.245
And the next thing I knew, I hear this loud wham, and the plane snapped to the left.

22:06.265 --> 22:07.606
And I thought I had lost a wing.

22:08.267 --> 22:10.971
But I kept the right rudder in, and I got it straightened out, and I looked up.

22:12.092 --> 22:18.721
And the wham was this canister that hangs down that is coated with chemicals that burns, and that's the flare.

22:18.741 --> 22:21.985
And it's suspended from a 16-foot diameter canopy parachute.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.874
And the canister hit the underside of the wing and left about a three-inch dent.

22:26.755 --> 22:32.306
And the parachute deployed over the top of the wing with its shroud lines wrapped around my rocket tubes.

22:32.326 --> 22:33.528
And it acted like a big air break.

22:34.730 --> 22:39.159
So at that point, it slowed me down to about 70 knots, which is a little more than 70 miles an hour.

22:40.581 --> 22:45.110
And I had the plane going straight, but I could only make left turns.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.352
And the winds were very strong.

22:47.395 --> 22:55.629
And I told the Air Force pilot that I couldn't play anymore and I was going back to the base, which was about 20 minutes away.

22:55.649 --> 23:05.745
And so I did a left turn back to the base and I was maybe five minutes into the flight back and I remembered that I had a Vietnamese observer in the back seat.

23:05.765 --> 23:08.890
I'd been sort of busy and had unfortunately forgotten about him.

23:09.932 --> 23:14.179
So I keyed the mic and turned and smiled at him real big and said, pretty exciting, huh?

23:15.155 --> 23:20.299
And this guy was the littlest observer we had, the littlest Vietnamese I ever knew.

23:21.260 --> 23:25.043
He had ripped this baby fire extinguisher out of a metal clamp on the back of my seat.

23:25.063 --> 23:26.064
He hadn't opened the clamp.

23:26.084 --> 23:28.346
We found out later he ripped it out.

23:28.366 --> 23:36.473
He was holding it as if that would put out the fire because what happened was dragging that thing through the air was like blowing on the embers of a campfire and it burst into flame.

23:37.374 --> 23:44.740
It was giving off enough light that I could read the lettering on my white phosphorus rockets and I could see my fuel vent dripping fuel and I can still see it today.

23:45.783 --> 23:52.110
And this young man was so scared that you've heard the expression, trembling like a leaf.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.254
His entire body from his head to his boots, and I looked, was vibrating.

23:56.575 --> 23:58.216
He was so scared.

23:58.236 --> 24:02.160
And the stream from that puny little fire extinguisher wasn't going to get to the flare.

24:03.682 --> 24:07.847
But eventually it went out of his own accord, and I did a left turn onto final.

24:07.867 --> 24:09.208
I felt I had to land into the wind.

24:10.268 --> 24:17.935
Unfortunately, into the wind meant I landed over the face of a cliff that this airfield was built on the edge of a 200 foot cliff.

24:19.556 --> 24:29.265
And in getting on final, starting my descent, I'd never landed in that much wind with a parachute hanging over my wing before, so I didn't know how to judge it.

24:29.285 --> 24:31.767
And my rate of descent was carrying me into the face of the cliff.

24:32.908 --> 24:36.792
And I added full power and was still coming down into the face of the cliff.

24:37.753 --> 24:38.233
And the

24:38.450 --> 24:57.589
Only other choice was to turn off into the ocean at night, dark night, landing away from shore with no flotation gear, with a survival vest full of radios and first aid kits and water and two bandoliers of M16 magazines around my chest like Pancho Villa.

24:58.227 --> 25:01.371
and a Vietnamese in the back seat that I'm responsible for to get out.

25:01.391 --> 25:06.718
I figured we'd have to walk along the bottom because there's no way we could swim with the combat boots and all that.

25:06.738 --> 25:13.666
So I elected to stay on course as long as I could and only turn off and ruin the plane in the water if that was the last choice.

25:14.768 --> 25:26.142
And whether you ascribe it to the power finally starting to lift me up or the parachute ripping or God lifting up and giving me a little mercy,

25:27.050 --> 25:39.267
I remember clearing the face of the cliff close enough that I could look down and see the tanglefoot barbed wire and a bunker to my left and cleared a road that ran right there and landed on the overrun of the runway.

25:39.287 --> 25:48.901
And there's a picture of my crew chiefs giving me a plaque with a piece of the parachute on it and a picture of me holding the parachute by the plane.

25:49.441 --> 25:50.963
So it was an interesting night.

25:52.205 --> 25:54.028
Interesting night that ended up good.

25:54.048 --> 25:55.690
There were good nights and there were bad nights and

25:56.648 --> 25:59.030
Unfortunately, we only have about a minute left.

25:59.951 --> 26:04.215
You talked about a reflection that you had when you left Vietnam that changed 20 years later.

26:04.655 --> 26:07.058
I need you to be real quick, but tell me that again.

26:07.738 --> 26:13.283
Well, knowing what I know today about our effort in Vietnam, I would do it again.

26:14.144 --> 26:17.948
I would absolutely do it again because I felt what I did was important.

26:19.969 --> 26:24.934
But for years, I regretted not having killed more North Vietnamese, more communists.

26:26.467 --> 26:30.091
Now, however, I regret having had to kill anybody.

26:30.311 --> 26:31.192
I'd still do it.

26:31.212 --> 26:32.593
I'd still go there and do my job.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.037
But I realize that most of those people were forced to be there.

26:36.838 --> 26:37.619
They had families.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.662
And I regret having to kill anybody.

26:41.262 --> 26:47.148
And I think that's the way we ought to look at war is that you don't relish it.

26:47.168 --> 26:49.491
You don't relish hurting people.

26:50.352 --> 26:51.613
But sometimes you've got to do it.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.651
John Anderson, thank you for your service, and thank you for being here.

26:55.671 --> 26:57.013
I wish we had more time.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.215
It's a wonderful story.

26:59.235 --> 27:05.062
Like so many brave soldiers of Vietnam, John Anderson indeed found himself in harm's way.

27:05.082 --> 27:12.471
And as he himself has said, he did his job not without fear, but indeed with confidence in his training and his ability.

27:13.071 --> 27:18.698
Like all veterans of that conflict, it's sometimes a difficult story to tell, and it always should be.

27:19.184 --> 27:22.549
It's the same kind of stories we hear today from the war on terror.

27:23.170 --> 27:27.055
Also difficult to tell, but we must all listen with uncommon pride.

27:27.816 --> 27:35.347
We salute Brazos Valley veteran Major John Anderson and thank him and all veterans for their service.

27:35.367 --> 27:38.011
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:38.031 --> 27:38.933
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:38.993 --> 27:41.857
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:41.857 --> 27:46.924

27:46.944 --> 27:56.385

27:56.645 --> 28:06.246
