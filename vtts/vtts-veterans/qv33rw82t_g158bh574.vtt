00:10.645 --> 00:34.712
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.732 --> 00:35.893
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.257 --> 00:39.040
Tyson Voelkel is not a veteran yet.

00:39.281 --> 00:43.328
He is still active duty Army proud soldier of the 82nd Airborne.

00:43.349 --> 00:51.123
Today, he's a graduate student at the George Bush School of Government and Public Service, preparing to move on to teach at West Point in 2007.

00:51.865 --> 00:55.772
It was a quick path from Texas A&M Corps of Cadet Commander to Iraq

00:56.410 --> 01:01.605
Company A, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment.

01:01.625 --> 01:08.766
A paratrooper, his unit attached to the Army's 1st Armored Division, working for a time in the Al-Rashid District of Baghdad.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.967
Two years ago, Tyson Voelkel was there for his first tour.

01:12.488 --> 01:14.391
His second tour ended just a few months ago.

01:14.672 --> 01:17.336
He's home now and here with us today to tell his story.

01:17.376 --> 01:18.899
Welcome, Captain Voelkel.

01:18.939 --> 01:20.101
It's such a pleasure to have you.

01:20.522 --> 01:26.231
Need to fast forward to when you first went to Iraq in 2003, February of 2003.

01:26.572 --> 01:30.018
Talk a little bit about your job with the 82nd Airborne as a planner.

01:30.058 --> 01:31.480
Talk about what that involves.

01:31.831 --> 01:34.154
Thanks for having me on the show.

01:34.495 --> 01:43.707
February 2003, we were alerted and ordered to go to Kuwait, the staging area, in preparation for the U.S.

01:43.747 --> 01:46.451
invasion into Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.

01:46.852 --> 01:55.223
At the time, I was an assistant operations officer and planner for 2nd Brigade, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment.

01:55.203 --> 02:12.870
and we had the responsibility for coordinating and planning all of the various combat power and military power, technology, resources, weapons needed to accomplish the mission that we were tasked with at the time.

02:13.832 --> 02:20.282
I worked with some outstanding senior officers and learned a great deal during that time.

02:20.549 --> 02:25.082
March 19, 2003, that was the date that Operation Iraqi Freedom actually started.

02:25.483 --> 02:28.231
You said you were staging in Kuwait when you got there in February.

02:28.251 --> 02:32.584
Talk about that time from February and actually where you were when the invasion started.

02:32.834 --> 02:46.014
Well, there were numerous different plans that were on the table as far as how to best utilize the 82nd Airborne Division and our brigade in the initial attack into Iraq.

02:46.876 --> 02:54.167
And at the time, we were training every single day for various different contingency type operations.

02:54.147 --> 03:08.456
and for the mission that we had at hand, conducting rehearsals and even practicing our airborne-type operations in case we were going to actually do a parachute assault into Iraq.

03:09.197 --> 03:14.147
And on March 19th, we actually got a...

03:14.313 --> 03:28.710
a change to our plan, the actual plan that we'd been working on for a while, and were ordered to get into Iraq as quickly as possible along a specified route to conduct operations.

03:28.792 --> 03:33.861
82nd Airborne is known for a short notice specialist, as it were.

03:34.202 --> 03:38.229
Within 18 hours of you receiving your orders, you're on your way to accomplish those orders, right?

03:38.369 --> 03:38.890
Right.

03:39.251 --> 03:44.640
The mission statement for the 82nd Airborne Division is to be able to deploy anywhere worldwide

03:44.620 --> 03:51.249
within 18 hours of notification in order to meet the strategic goals and needs of the United States.

03:51.970 --> 04:00.622
And the president has that authority to call on us as a rapidly deployable strategic response force.

04:00.922 --> 04:12.257
I thought it was interesting that you told me that when you were first starting this mission that a lot of you, including yourself, looked at this a little bit like Desert Storm might be, a quick operation, a couple of months and you might be home.

04:12.758 --> 04:14.340
Obviously, it didn't turn out to be that way.

04:14.590 --> 04:14.890
Right.

04:15.411 --> 04:21.240
The initial plan was to basically do what had been done during a desert storm.

04:22.021 --> 04:28.070
And you heard the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, say, we're going to start with shock and awe.

04:28.551 --> 04:31.696
And after shock and awe, we'll move into and get our ground troopers in there.

04:32.597 --> 04:35.101
We will secure the terrain and the war will be over.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.463
And as you know, the war...

04:36.443 --> 04:40.689
was declared, that it was ended fairly soon.

04:41.149 --> 04:48.619
However, the toughest part about this war has been in the rebuilding and the restructure of the country.

04:48.880 --> 04:53.566
It was in dire needs of repairs at all different levels.

04:53.967 --> 05:04.020
And so, naturally, they kept us there to help get this infrastructure rebuilt and to get the people of Iraq started on the right foot towards democracy.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.765
You talked about resistance on the way into Baghdad.

05:07.527 --> 05:10.392
Can you recall the first time a bullet was coming in your direction?

05:10.653 --> 05:19.950
Well, I tell you, the toughest combat operations that the 82nd, well, our brigade faced, was in a city known as the Samoa.

05:19.930 --> 05:25.218
and that was some of the toughest fighting that our paratroopers had to deal with.

05:26.099 --> 05:46.950
We didn't lose a single soldier during those engagements and during that time, and we faced over 600, in some estimates as high as 800, enemy resistance, which was the remnants of Saddam Hussein's Fede'in army and some of his Royal Republican Guard who were there in the city of Osamuwa.

05:46.930 --> 05:54.846
As soon as we defeated the enemy, within a couple of days we were driving through the city and it was almost like a parade.

05:55.528 --> 06:03.825
The children were out in the streets clapping, people chanting and saying, USA good, USA good, Bush good, Bush good.

06:03.805 --> 06:20.979
and it was an overwhelming sense of pride and honor that I believe every one of our paratroopers had during that time because we did what we had set out to do and accomplish and basically set these people free.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.962
You talked to me about that sense of accomplishment, and I'm glad you brought that up.

06:23.982 --> 06:33.610
I want to talk, though, about your job in planning and how that sort of ingrained with the political...

06:34.636 --> 06:39.473
how it went with the political thoughts and how everything had to be sort of PC as we say today.

06:39.493 --> 06:41.059
Sort of talk about that element of your job.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.190
Well, the tough part about

06:44.508 --> 06:58.851
The types of wars that we face now, and also if you look back to the Vietnam War, is that you've got television cameras, media personnel, and the world watching every single move that you make.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.535
And we were very aware of that.

07:01.615 --> 07:07.765
The United States military is the best equipped, best trained, and most professional fighting force the world has ever seen.

07:07.745 --> 07:25.847
And that being said, we take precautions in order to make sure that we don't do anything that would be misconstrued or viewed as America or the United States taking advantage of its power and using it for evil purposes.

07:25.867 --> 07:30.192
One great example is many of the schools that we came across in Iraq

07:30.172 --> 07:37.886
were full of ammunition, full of mortar rounds, rockets, Katyusha rockets.

07:37.906 --> 07:47.404
Basically, Saddam knew that the United States would not stand for precision-guided munitions being shown blowing up schools.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.787
whether or not the schools were weapons caches or not.

07:50.548 --> 08:01.964
So they stored a lot of their weapons in these schoolhouses and we knew that and so we did not purposely bomb any of these structures.

08:01.984 --> 08:09.494
We went in on foot with our soldiers to secure these areas and then remove the weapons and remove the ammunition.

08:10.015 --> 08:14.421
And that carried through and permeated every aspect of our operations.

08:14.401 --> 08:17.309
was what effect will this have on the civilian population?

08:17.970 --> 08:21.961
What effect will this have on our presence here in Iraq?

08:22.322 --> 08:29.440
And what will the perception be around the world when these videos and this footage is sent across the news wire?

08:29.892 --> 08:31.854
So it was a whole lot more than just fighting the war.

08:31.894 --> 08:35.578
It was fighting the war and then paying attention to the perception of the fighting.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.339
Right.

08:36.359 --> 08:43.887
And sometimes it's very difficult to achieve great success in both simultaneously.

08:43.907 --> 08:45.329
And there's got to be some give and take.

08:45.529 --> 08:47.171
And we learn those lessons early on.

08:47.211 --> 08:57.722
And truthfully, we're still learning every single day on how to maximize all the good that the United States military is doing and the coalition forces.

08:57.702 --> 09:08.809
are doing there in Iraq because there's a tendency for only the negative and only the bad to come out of a lot of the reports.

09:09.143 --> 09:11.526
Iraq then and Iraq now are quite different places.

09:11.546 --> 09:22.940
You told me that in 2003, when you first went in, as far as communication, as far as accommodations, as far as food, as far as air conditioning, of which there wasn't any, it was a whole lot different then.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.906
Communication, first time you were able to call your wife, Christy.

09:27.926 --> 09:28.807
Talk about what happened.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.509
I'll never forget that.

09:30.649 --> 09:37.497
It had been at least three months, and my timing's off on a little bit of this stuff, but since I'd been able to call and talk to my wife,

09:37.477 --> 09:48.240
And our brigade commander had a satellite phone and was letting the soldiers use this satellite phone so that they could call home and check in with their families.

09:48.300 --> 09:55.114
And I was kind of further down the list because most of the officers said they'd wait and let all the soldiers go first.

09:55.094 --> 10:08.703
Nonetheless, I wanted some privacy and we just got these port-a-lets, port-a-john toilets that had come in and figured, you know what, I'm going to go hide out for a few minutes and talk to my wife on the phone.

10:08.723 --> 10:15.718
And I was just telling her about how safe it was and not to worry about me or about our soldiers and that everything was going.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.842
just perfectly, and that we were in one of the safest areas we could be in.

10:20.383 --> 10:24.867
And then three mortar rounds came in, and you could just feel the air get stucked out from around us.

10:24.947 --> 10:27.330
This is while you're talking to her on the phone.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.192
While I was talking to her on the phone.

10:29.212 --> 10:35.378
And thank God they landed on the other side of about a 10-foot wall.

10:36.239 --> 10:42.145
But it was loud enough, and the concussion was bad enough so that we lost our connection.

10:42.125 --> 10:45.813
and I wasn't able to talk to her again for about four days.

10:45.933 --> 10:50.523
And if she were sitting here and telling me about those four days, I bet that would be quite a story.

10:50.543 --> 10:53.530
Yes, it was gut-wrenching for her.

10:53.550 --> 10:55.915
And of course I went right back into

10:56.283 --> 10:57.646
getting work done and everything.

10:57.706 --> 11:02.517
And I said I was going to get on the phone as soon as I could to talk to her.

11:02.877 --> 11:03.699
I bet you had to.

11:05.282 --> 11:09.712
You arrived in Baghdad, the sector that you were assigned to between the airport and the Tigris River.

11:10.013 --> 11:13.380
Talk a little bit about sort of set the scene for us there in Baghdad when you arrived.

11:13.394 --> 11:19.881
Well, Baghdad's a fairly large city, very populated and urban.

11:20.581 --> 11:25.206
On the outskirts of the city, it's very rural, much like most United States cities.

11:26.367 --> 11:32.934
The sector that we were responsible for consisted of close to 1.2 million people in total.

11:33.054 --> 11:34.516
That's the entire brigade sector.

11:35.336 --> 11:40.802
And in my particular sector as a company commander, I had about 250,000 people.

11:40.782 --> 11:44.646
estimated that my paratroopers were responsible for.

11:45.587 --> 12:08.528
And that was everything from security to infrastructure, rebuilding sewage systems, schools, teaching them about democracy to our city councils, as well as to hunting down insurgents, black market arms dealers, drug dealers, kidnappers, money counterfeiters, the list goes on.

12:08.508 --> 12:15.244
2003, the summer you took command of Company A. You were a company commander, about 136 under your command in Alpha Company.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.294
Talk a little bit how your career changed when you became a company commander.

12:19.426 --> 12:23.171
Well, my career path changed in a matter of minutes.

12:23.652 --> 12:31.482
The night before I took command of the company, our brigade commander, who at the time was named Kurt Fuller, said, Tyson, you're going to be the commander of Alpha Company.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.687
And I thought he was role-playing with me and some more training.

12:35.107 --> 12:36.749
And I said, OK, sir, what's the situation?

12:36.769 --> 12:41.756
And he put his feet on the desk, and he had a dip of Copenhagen in his mouth, and he spit in his cup.

12:41.776 --> 12:43.518
And he said, no, you're the commander of Alpha Company.

12:43.559 --> 12:46.142
Get out of here and go take command, take charge of that company.

12:46.493 --> 13:01.937
And that next day, I was responsible for 136 men's lives and the success or failure of our forces within that sector of 250,000 Iraqi citizens.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.980
It was a life-changing event.

13:04.541 --> 13:20.346
That very night, we conducted raids, and from then on, it was 18, 20-hour days trying to do the best that we could for the people of Al-Rasala and Al-Shurta sectors and do what was best for our paratroopers.

13:20.547 --> 13:22.069
Talk about the typical day.

13:22.049 --> 13:29.262
A typical day consisted of planning for future operations.

13:29.282 --> 13:40.943
It consisted of meetings with non-governmental organizations, not-for-profit organizations such as Red Cross, CARE, UNICEF, just various organizations, as well as U.S.

13:41.024 --> 13:44.530
federal agencies like the United States Agency for International Development,

13:44.510 --> 13:45.371
U.S.

13:45.491 --> 13:52.322
aid, and figuring out ways to rebuild within our sector.

13:53.424 --> 13:56.789
We had 60 schools within our sector, both male and female.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.593
We had 32 mosques.

14:00.635 --> 14:02.177
We had sewage.

14:02.397 --> 14:05.522
That was sewage infrastructure that was almost non-existent.

14:05.958 --> 14:12.047
to the point where most of the homes were built and then they thought about sewage pipes and all that after the fact.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.030
So there was lots and lots of problems.

14:15.092 --> 14:30.615
In the meantime, we were gathering intelligence and planning operations at night for our raids against insurgents and mostly black market arms dealers and pro-Saddam Hussein

14:30.595 --> 14:37.810
or pro-Baath Party loyalists who were conducting attacks against coalition forces.

14:37.830 --> 14:48.672
So by day we were rebuilding and teaching and training the future Iraqi forces and by night we were conducting raids against these various targets.

14:48.652 --> 14:51.775
We are known for our capability to fight at night.

14:51.995 --> 14:59.303
There's not another military in the world that has the night vision capabilities and the communications that we have.

14:59.823 --> 15:13.917
So we preferred to fight at night because that was our territory, and we could control the pace, tempo, and the illumination of our operations by shutting power off to certain parts of the neighborhoods,

15:13.897 --> 15:20.526
So that when we went in, it was pitch black and it kept things calmer that way.

15:21.347 --> 15:24.592
Captain Voelkel has brought several photographs with him.

15:24.612 --> 15:28.357
As a matter of fact, one of the photographs we're about to see is going to be an example of that night vision.

15:28.377 --> 15:34.185
And I'd like to go ahead, if we can, and go to some of the photographs that he has supplied for us.

15:34.225 --> 15:38.931
These photographs, it was a well photographed war, obviously, and both on television.

15:39.432 --> 15:39.813
There we go.

15:39.833 --> 15:43.077
Take a look at these and just sort of briefly describe what we're looking at.

15:43.225 --> 15:50.116
That's actually my First Sergeant, First Sergeant Stephen Bower and myself, and this was during our most recent deployment.

15:50.957 --> 15:57.407
That is in the green zone in a bombed out palace there, which was our base during our second deployment.

15:57.427 --> 15:59.671
And we're going to talk about the second deployment a little bit later on.

15:59.711 --> 16:02.275
Let's move on to several pictures to tell you.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.238
This obviously is the result of a car bomb.

16:04.218 --> 16:04.979
Right.

16:05.239 --> 16:21.798
These are insurgents cars who were filled with ammunition and explosives, and actually they were rushing towards a checkpoint, and our soldiers basically eliminated the threat there.

16:22.719 --> 16:30.327
Of course, the insurgents were killed, but the secondary explosions that occurred after the cars

16:30.307 --> 16:34.515
were hit with our fire, of course, caused them to blow up.

16:34.755 --> 16:36.218
Okay, next picture.

16:37.039 --> 16:37.440
There we go.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.185
That's an example of the night vision.

16:40.245 --> 16:45.114
This is a photograph that'll be familiar to many U.S.

16:45.455 --> 16:52.247
and also Department of State personnel because this is taken of Chinook helicopters

16:52.227 --> 16:58.597
transporting personnel from the Baghdad airport into various sectors of Baghdad.

16:58.617 --> 17:06.408
Currently one of the safest ways to get people into and out of the airport and also how we conduct some of our operations.

17:06.669 --> 17:07.730
Okay, move on.

17:09.173 --> 17:14.100
That's out in the eastern portion of Baghdad, the very actually eastern

17:14.350 --> 17:35.278
far eastern Baghdad out in the desert where we have where the United States has actually got some training facilities and those are some of my lieutenants and you can just see this was during the middle of the summer so it's hot and very very dusty yeah and no shower facilities so you get to learn how to love the dirt and your neighbor and your neighbor

17:36.288 --> 17:52.211
This is a picture with one of the greatest assets we've got, which is dog teams, and they sniff out bombs, explosives, drugs, you name it, and we use those dog teams and their handlers very often in our operations.

17:52.231 --> 17:59.762
This particular one, that's Dixie, and she helped us find one of the largest weapons caches in southern Baghdad.

17:59.922 --> 18:00.182
Wow.

18:01.044 --> 18:01.384
Okay.

18:02.849 --> 18:08.541
This is a picture of inside what's known as the green zone.

18:08.801 --> 18:11.527
That building there in the center is actually a mosque.

18:12.309 --> 18:21.027
And our responsibilities with the various mosques and political officials as well as religious clerics

18:21.007 --> 18:23.389
within the city was great.

18:23.409 --> 18:38.605
We had to meet with them on a weekly basis at a minimum in order to find out issues, concerns that they had with United States operations as well as they would help us in solving many of the infrastructure problems that we had.

18:40.366 --> 18:46.272
And that's just a picture outside of after an engagement that we had.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.214
I just thought that was a great black and white photo.

18:48.234 --> 18:49.155
Had to include that.

18:49.175 --> 18:50.136
Okay, let's move on.

18:51.382 --> 18:56.267
This is a part of Baghdad known as Haifa.

18:56.287 --> 18:59.972
And this is taken from one of our sniper positions there.

19:01.673 --> 19:14.608
And basically, it kind of gives you some scope and perception as to what the city actually looks like downtown and what our soldiers have to deal with and how difficult it is to identify enemy versus friendly.

19:15.389 --> 19:18.452
And that's why this is a good picture.

19:19.816 --> 19:20.997
Another shot of Baghdad.

19:21.017 --> 19:22.559
Another picture of Baghdad.

19:26.022 --> 19:27.564
Okay.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.746
This was actually during the first deployment.

19:30.246 --> 19:34.851
What you're looking at is the back of actually a Nissan pickup truck that was a suicide bomber.

19:35.712 --> 19:47.123
And he brought in about 500 pounds of explosives into the police station, which was about 500 meters away from my company headquarters.

19:47.575 --> 19:58.485
and blew himself up and did irreparable damage to the police station, killed about 14 Iraqis and two National Guard U.S.

19:58.525 --> 20:00.447
soldiers that day.

20:01.888 --> 20:02.269
Texans?

20:02.429 --> 20:11.157
That's a good Texas picture of a few of the soldiers in our company that were from Texas, and that was also during the first deployment.

20:14.580 --> 20:14.680
Okay.

20:15.638 --> 20:20.645
This is part of a weapons cache that we had found in southern Baghdad.

20:21.246 --> 20:38.389
This particular black market arms dealer had everything from Kalashnikovs to various submachine guns and anti-aircraft rockets, mortars, so it was very sizable.

20:38.369 --> 20:46.652
weapons cache that the soldiers from Alpha Company, with the help of Dixie, the dog there, we were able to confiscate.

20:47.555 --> 20:49.540
Your first deployment was about a year.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.686
I believe you came home in February of 2004.

20:52.047 --> 20:54.133
You spent 10 months here.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.764
Jumping back with the 82nd again.

20:58.285 --> 21:08.016
And then you were deployed again for the express purpose of providing security for the Iraqi elections, which took place on January 31st of this year of 2005.

21:08.557 --> 21:11.120
So talk about your second deployment and what was involved there.

21:11.420 --> 21:14.904
The second deployment was a short notice deployment.

21:15.265 --> 21:21.792
We basically had about 96 hours from the time we were told you're going to Iraq till the time we were actually on the ground.

21:22.092 --> 21:23.335
there in Iraq.

21:24.197 --> 21:37.907
It was a perfect example of the combatant commanders in Iraq saying we need another battalion, two battalions, to go to Iraq in order to help with security.

21:37.887 --> 21:46.618
It was vital that we had overwhelming combat power to help ensure the successful elections in January.

21:47.620 --> 21:50.243
And that was our express mission and why we went.

21:50.464 --> 22:00.897
We went to the Green Zone and provided security for the various diplomats and governmental personnel that worked inside and around the Green Zone.

22:00.917 --> 22:04.502
And we also had one company from our battalion that was

22:04.482 --> 22:17.745
sent to work with a CAV unit up in an area called Haifa Street, where they saw very intense operations fighting insurgents up in that area and did a very good job.

22:17.985 --> 22:26.900
You talked about the sense of accomplishment you had felt two years earlier on your first deployment, a very similar sense of accomplishment on election day, which also happened to be your 31st birthday.

22:27.281 --> 22:29.224
Talk about your feeling on that election day.

22:29.204 --> 22:31.207
Right, it was unbelievable.

22:31.247 --> 22:36.896
Overpowering and one of the most rewarding feelings that I've ever had.

22:37.257 --> 22:49.035
During the first deployment, after we'd finished the battles there in the Samoa, and we were driving through the city, and the people were in the streets clapping and cheering for us, was just inspiring.

22:49.724 --> 23:07.463
Getting the opportunity to go back and help support the first democratic elections in Iraq and seeing the fruits of our labor for this entire time just confirmed it to not just me but our soldiers and many of the officials that are working to help

23:07.443 --> 23:09.146
give Iraq their freedom.

23:09.887 --> 23:23.169
And it was amazing to see all levels of wealth as far as the people coming to vote, women in large, large numbers.

23:23.209 --> 23:28.017
We had 10,000 people in our sector that had come out to vote.

23:28.148 --> 23:33.302
And they were proud of the fact that they had these ink-stained fingers that showed that they had voted.

23:33.924 --> 23:41.245
And it was just a great feeling for all of us and a great sense of pride and accomplishment throughout the entire city.

23:42.027 --> 23:43.491
The tough part was...

23:44.146 --> 23:48.113
the coalition forces could not have too much of a presence.

23:49.034 --> 24:01.495
Otherwise, we would be viewed as rigging the elections or that we were too heavy-handed and that the elections were successful because we rigged it and so on and so forth.

24:01.515 --> 24:03.859
So the tough job was

24:04.261 --> 24:16.699
Provide security so no bombers, no suicide bombers, no snipers get in and disrupt the elections and disrupt the transportation of all the polling material and the voting cards and everything.

24:16.719 --> 24:18.001
But you have to stay out of sight.

24:18.722 --> 24:19.924
So very difficult.

24:20.244 --> 24:27.535
And the coalition forces, once again, and the paratroopers did an outstanding job in doing just that.

24:28.088 --> 24:32.018
Captain Voelkel comes from a family of public service for sure.

24:32.078 --> 24:35.267
His great, great grandfather was A&M class of 1881.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.074
His granddad was an Aggie.

24:38.134 --> 24:40.220
His father served in the Peace Corps.

24:40.561 --> 24:43.348
And I want you to talk about your brothers, Bo and Trevor.

24:43.528 --> 24:44.511
They are both

24:44.879 --> 24:47.582
military, both Aggie grads, and I know you're proud of them.

24:47.743 --> 24:50.426
I'm very proud of my little brothers.

24:50.827 --> 24:57.395
My younger brother, Bo, Bo Voelkel was Aggie band commander, a biomedical science major.

24:57.415 --> 24:59.137
He had much better grades than I did.

24:59.157 --> 25:14.076
He had the brains in the family, and he served as an airborne infantry officer, ranger, and was in Korea, and just recently left the service.

25:14.056 --> 25:18.040
And my youngest brother, Trevor, also an Aggie.

25:18.621 --> 25:26.029
He was a core public relations officer when he was here and involved in just numerous student organizations and different aspects of A&M.

25:26.049 --> 25:27.731
And actually, I take that back.

25:27.771 --> 25:28.812
He's got the brains in the family.

25:28.832 --> 25:30.935
I think he had the highest GPA.

25:30.955 --> 25:36.541
But he's also, he's still currently active duty and served 10 months there in Iraq.

25:36.581 --> 25:38.463
We were there at the same time but never saw each other.

25:39.264 --> 25:43.168
And he's also an airborne ranger as well.

25:43.148 --> 25:49.377
And I'm very proud of both of them and the fact that they chose to serve their country as well.

25:49.838 --> 25:50.719
You were born in Bryan.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.063
You grew up in Brenham, a Brenham Cub.

25:53.724 --> 26:00.193
And I know that your wife, Christy, you talked a lot about family and what families go through in war.

26:00.794 --> 26:04.820
And your wife was the one that was here waiting for you, worrying about you.

26:04.840 --> 26:09.567
And your wife, Christy, is now Media Relations Director for the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M.

26:10.008 --> 26:11.670
Obviously a very special lady to you.

26:11.971 --> 26:12.792
Yes.

26:13.553 --> 26:35.987
One of the greatest lessons that I learned during my different tours in Iraq and my service throughout the military is that the unsung heroes of our military services are the wives, spouses, children, and the parents of these men and women who choose to serve their country.

26:35.967 --> 26:53.834
and put themselves in harm's way so that Americans can live the life that they want to live and so that Americans can have the option to choose and we have the freedom to choose what we do because there's these veterans and because of these outstanding young men and women.

26:53.854 --> 27:04.270
But these family members really bear a huge burden, especially when we're dealing with warfare like we're in today, asymmetric threats.

27:04.385 --> 27:09.610
Captain Voelkel, congratulations and good luck in your studies and your future endeavors, and thank you for being with us.

27:09.911 --> 27:10.551
Thank you very much.

27:11.232 --> 27:16.017
The war on terror continues, and every day men and women put themselves in harm's way to fight it.

27:16.357 --> 27:24.465
Regardless of how you feel about our purpose in Iraq, we unite in our prayers for their safe return and our pride for their brave service.

27:24.906 --> 27:27.889
Thank you, Captain Tyson Voelkel, for your continuing service.

27:28.389 --> 27:30.451
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:30.831 --> 27:31.732
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.375
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
