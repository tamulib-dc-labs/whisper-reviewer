00:16.737 --> 00:40.601
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.002
I'm Tom Turveyville.

00:42.893 --> 00:46.798
Many, including those who fought in it, called the Korean War the Forgotten War.

00:47.419 --> 00:54.649
It was certainly not forgotten by the some 1900 Aggies who served there, certainly not by the families of the 63 Aggies who died there.

00:55.290 --> 01:02.080
Second Lieutenant Bob Middleton took the fast track from his graduation from A&M in 1951 to the front lines at Heartbreak Ridge.

01:02.721 --> 01:07.107
That's where they did battle, mostly in the pitch dark of night, often in the snow.

01:07.127 --> 01:12.394
Bob Middleton left Korea with many memories of survival and with the Army's Silver Star Medal.

01:12.931 --> 01:20.081
Today, retired in College Station with his wife, Bobby Joyce, Bob Middleton is rightly proud to have served his country in combat.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.983
Bob Middleton, thank you for joining us.

01:22.043 --> 01:27.050
It is a pleasure to have really my first Korean War veteran on Veterans of the Valley.

01:27.711 --> 01:35.241
It's called the Forgotten War, but you look at it as while World War II may have been the greatest generation, you said that you were their younger brothers.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.285
Why do you think it's called the Forgotten War?

01:38.365 --> 01:38.926
Why do you think that?

01:38.946 --> 01:40.508
Because of its timing in history?

01:40.758 --> 01:46.246
Well, I think it fell in between World War II and Vietnam.

01:46.707 --> 01:51.854
And when we finished, we just went back home and went about our business.

01:52.235 --> 01:55.339
And nobody seemed to have missed us.

01:55.359 --> 02:00.927
In fact, one person told me when I was back after being gone two years in the Army,

02:01.717 --> 02:04.681
If you want to know where I'd been, he hadn't seen me in two or three weeks.

02:05.863 --> 02:11.231
I can't say why they've forgotten it, but it is forgotten.

02:11.271 --> 02:14.736
Most of the younger generation don't even know what you're talking about.

02:14.756 --> 02:18.041
And the older ones will remember, oh, yeah, I remember that happened back.

02:19.023 --> 02:22.628
Yeah, I remember it was in there between World War II and Vietnam.

02:22.912 --> 02:24.173
Let's go back early on.

02:24.213 --> 02:28.338
You graduated from A&M in 1951, but you grew up, you hopped around the Brazos Valley.

02:28.358 --> 02:32.743
You grew up in Tomball, born in Iola, spent some time in Navasota and Hearn.

02:32.763 --> 02:35.185
So you've been all around the Brazos Valley in your youth, right?

02:35.205 --> 02:37.187
Yes, besides going to Texas A&M.

02:37.848 --> 02:46.337
As you say, I was born in Iola, Texas, which is just 25 miles from here on an old farm of my grandfather.

02:46.317 --> 02:59.110
I started the first grade in Minnesota and went three years in Hearn and went from there to Tomball and graduated from Tomball High School and eventually from Texas A&M.

02:59.130 --> 03:03.575
Indeed, as we said, it was a fast track from Texas A&M to the front lines in Korea.

03:03.595 --> 03:04.435
Your class of 1951.

03:05.657 --> 03:13.945
Right in there, classes from 49 to 51, 52, those were the folks that pretty much went straight from A&M

03:14.127 --> 03:16.932
to Korea because that's when that war was being fought.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
That's right.

03:18.051 --> 03:25.799
I would say the class of 50 took the brunt of it because they got out just as it happened in June of 1950.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.885
And they were picked up and sent over right then.

03:30.905 --> 03:38.293
And most of them were involved in the charge from Pusan back up to the Yalu River and back.

03:38.433 --> 03:46.682
And some of them were involved in the Chosen Reservoir, which was probably the worst battle that ever happened in Korea.

03:46.831 --> 03:47.797
Now, you did get some training.

03:47.817 --> 03:49.325
You went 16 weeks to Fort Benning.

03:49.386 --> 03:53.972
Talk a little bit about your training and then what led you over to Korea.

03:54.307 --> 04:01.956
When I first got my orders, I was ordered directly to Fort Benning, Georgia for a 16 week associate army officer school.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.501
And there we learned how to be officers.

04:05.561 --> 04:07.924
We were already officers with the teachers how to be.

04:07.944 --> 04:09.165
And it was a good school.

04:09.226 --> 04:14.292
We went through all the basics that you do with training of troops.

04:14.312 --> 04:20.780
We were down doing the nitty gritty, doing the rifle of work and everything else.

04:21.601 --> 04:22.542
But my orders had,

04:23.703 --> 04:28.128
also assigned me to this 6th Infantry Division in Fort Ord, California.

04:28.168 --> 04:43.527
After that 16 weeks, we went to Fort Ord, and our job there was to train new recruits, the draftees that were coming in, and we had to put them through an eight-week training program.

04:43.627 --> 04:53.018
And then I got through one full program and partially through another, and my orders came to go to Korea,

04:53.774 --> 04:56.598
Which you did, and you left your wife, and you left, I believe, a brand new daughter?

04:56.758 --> 04:57.298
Yes, I did.

04:57.419 --> 05:03.927
You went to Hobby Airport, got on a plane, and by the time you were through flying, you were from Hobby to the front lines pretty much, wasn't it?

05:03.947 --> 05:06.330
I flew from Hobby to battalion headquarters.

05:07.131 --> 05:10.355
And then I had to take a jeep and then on.

05:10.395 --> 05:11.556
I guess they couldn't get me there.

05:11.616 --> 05:18.785
But from battalion on to the front lines then, you were in direct sight of the enemy.

05:19.406 --> 05:23.511
Once you went around a little finger behind the mountain,

05:23.828 --> 05:27.014
You went right up what was called the Mong Dong Nee Valley.

05:27.034 --> 05:27.154
Right.

05:27.635 --> 05:30.360
And they could see you forever.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.848
I mean, it was just like the, on a clear night, you can see forever.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.173
I think somebody wrote a song or wrote a book about that or something.

05:38.194 --> 05:38.354
Indeed.

05:38.374 --> 05:40.197
So you were in the big show quickly.

05:40.317 --> 05:41.600
And you were a platoon leader.

05:41.780 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.663
55 men in your platoon.

05:44.104 --> 05:47.490
Were you a little surprised when you got there that they made you a platoon leader?

05:47.926 --> 05:49.287
Well, not really.

05:49.327 --> 05:52.491
That was my military occupation specialty.

05:52.511 --> 05:56.374
1542, infantry unit commander, so that's what you expect.

05:58.116 --> 06:00.298
Your platoon was called the International Platoon.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.960
Not a whole lot of them spoke English, right?

06:01.980 --> 06:02.881
That's right.

06:02.901 --> 06:07.786
I was in the 40th Infantry Division, which was the California National Guard.

06:08.987 --> 06:15.874
When they went over there, I think they pulled a little political pressure, but they couldn't pull

06:16.073 --> 06:19.237
the unit off, so they just started pulling individuals.

06:19.257 --> 06:24.644
And when they replaced them, they didn't replace them with enough troops, and so they had to borrow troops from somewhere else.

06:24.664 --> 06:28.729
And we had a lot of patooshes, Korean attached to the United States Army.

06:29.631 --> 06:33.996
And they, of course, they were the top of the ROC Army.

06:34.337 --> 06:35.759
These were South Korean soldiers who were attacked.

06:35.779 --> 06:38.402
They were South Korean soldiers out of the ROC Army.

06:38.753 --> 06:47.684
But they couldn't speak English, but they assigned anyone that had Cassius assigned to them, they assigned an interpreter.

06:47.704 --> 07:02.341
And I had a kid named Pox, who was 16 years old, and what they did was pick out kids that could speak, the young kids that could speak English, and they stayed there right on the front lines with the people and interpreted for them.

07:03.082 --> 07:06.786
And he was also, his official duty was a houseboy.

07:06.935 --> 07:10.039
which I think was confusing because he should have been an interpreter.

07:10.559 --> 07:11.700
But he was my houseboy.

07:11.761 --> 07:14.504
But I always had somebody that could speak Korean.

07:15.285 --> 07:22.533
And at one time, he was replaced by a 13-year-old who could speak better English than I could.

07:24.555 --> 07:32.664
And by the time, when I get up to 17 years old, they put them in the rock harness and send you another one.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.568
So that was sort of a military training for them.

07:35.588 --> 07:35.828
Right.

07:36.162 --> 07:39.867
I want to talk a little bit about the makeup of your platoon.

07:40.208 --> 07:44.174
There's a gentleman whose name we have not mentioned yet by the name of Ken Shockey.

07:44.214 --> 07:49.301
And Ken was your tank platoon commander, but you knew him long before you met up with him in Korea.

07:49.401 --> 07:50.082
Talk about that.

07:50.703 --> 07:51.985
Well, that's right.

07:52.065 --> 07:53.086
Ken was an Aggie.

07:53.106 --> 07:59.195
He was a classmate of mine, and he was the commander of B Company, and I was in E Company infantry.

08:00.116 --> 08:01.258
And I went to...

08:01.677 --> 08:09.088
Fort Benning, well, he was about two weeks ahead, two or four weeks ahead of me, I don't know, but he was there, and I saw him quite often, and we visited back and forth.

08:10.009 --> 08:29.237
When I went to Fort Ord, I was assigned to the 20th Infantry Regiment to Company C. And I got there, and sure enough, Ken Shockey, he was one of the platoon leaders in Company C. And I lived right across from him.

08:29.386 --> 08:31.430
in the Ord Village.

08:32.171 --> 08:41.568
And so we went through that, and he took off to Korea a few weeks before I did, and then I followed him to Korea.

08:41.588 --> 08:47.479
And when I got to my company commander, my company command post, one thing he told me was to

08:48.944 --> 08:58.678
be sure as soon as I could get over and introduce myself to the tank platoon leader, because he had five tanks attached to my platoon, and I needed to work closely with him.

08:58.718 --> 09:06.750
And the next morning, I got up and went over to the tank platoon command post, which was about 15 yards from mine.

09:06.770 --> 09:09.053
And sure enough, there was Ken Shockey sitting in there.

09:09.093 --> 09:10.556
He was the tank command.

09:10.576 --> 09:11.417
What did he say to you?

09:11.797 --> 09:14.201
And he said something to the effect that, where have you been?

09:14.301 --> 09:15.643
I've been waiting for you.

09:16.417 --> 09:17.878
From Texas A&M to Korea.

09:18.139 --> 09:18.799
And there you are.

09:19.059 --> 09:19.720
And you meet up.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.945
We're going to talk a little bit specifically about Heartbreak Ridge.

09:25.325 --> 09:33.332
And I want to read something that you wrote a couple of years ago when you talked about your service.

09:33.352 --> 09:35.033
And you were describing the ridge.

09:35.093 --> 09:41.539
It says, down the ridge and about a third of the way across the valley ran a swift flowing shallow river.

09:41.559 --> 09:45.883
The bank on the east side from where we were coming was straight up and about 15 feet high.

09:46.825 --> 09:52.752
and could only be traversed by rope ladder, which was lowered by the soldier on duty at the station at the time.

09:53.542 --> 09:56.326
And then you go on to write about the password and the countersign.

09:56.786 --> 10:03.636
And you wrote about something very interesting on a particular date, April the 21st, about that password and the countersign.

10:03.676 --> 10:04.417
Remember what you wrote?

10:04.457 --> 10:05.458
Oh, yes.

10:05.478 --> 10:07.120
The password was given to us every morning.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.645
It came down from sold.

10:10.665 --> 10:11.606
It changed every morning.

10:11.626 --> 10:12.488
It changed every morning.

10:12.988 --> 10:19.016
And you had a password and a countersign, kind of like an ID in the password you have on your computer now.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.760
But you had to...

10:21.740 --> 10:29.370
Guard gave you the password and you gave him the countersign and on April 21st the password was Texas and the countersign was Aggie.

10:30.511 --> 10:31.733
So that was Mustard Day.

10:32.434 --> 10:34.837
Well, there were Aggies everywhere in Korea.

10:34.857 --> 10:36.139
You ran into them everywhere.

10:36.319 --> 10:42.767
Later on we're going to talk about a former A&M Commandant that you ran into, but it was amazing.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.030
We said at the beginning, 1900.

10:45.517 --> 10:48.000
Aggies served in the Korean War.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.861
So you were running into them everywhere.

10:49.881 --> 10:53.285
I saw them practically all the time.

10:53.305 --> 10:56.428
In one place or another, you'd run into an Aggie.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.351
You came away from Korea with the Silver Star.

10:59.591 --> 11:15.287
Tell us about the particular incident, more than an incident, the battle, to where you and I know that Shockey was also involved in this same battle, where you were awarded the Silver Star.

11:15.790 --> 11:20.055
Well, we had, every night we sent out ambush patrols.

11:20.436 --> 11:27.824
And that was just seven men or so would go out in front of the lines a few hundred yards and set up just to let you know if somebody was coming in.

11:27.944 --> 11:38.457
And occasionally, about once a week or so, they would send out larger patrols.

11:38.437 --> 11:40.260
which was called a combat patrol.

11:41.161 --> 11:50.496
And different platoon leaders would take their men out and go to different areas and try to make contact with the enemy, and usually did.

11:50.516 --> 11:57.947
And this particular night, we had three different locations we had to go out to, and our purpose was to capture

11:59.142 --> 12:24.998
a prisoner if we could and so we went to this first area uh out in front of the lines and uh sit for about an hour and nothing happened and so we picked up and went to the second area and actually i had three different sections of my patrol i had a reserve patrol and a ready reserve patrol consisting of about seven men each and

12:25.349 --> 12:27.997
And the reserve was to stand back until we needed it.

12:28.098 --> 12:34.498
And the ready reserve was to just stay behind us until if we found action, they would come in and assist.

12:36.520 --> 12:42.546
After the second location, we went on to the third location, which was rather deep.

12:42.566 --> 12:44.407
We were sort of expecting something there.

12:45.488 --> 12:48.911
And we went partially up a finger towards the mountain.

12:48.932 --> 12:53.075
And we had a place that we were supposed to stay.

12:53.235 --> 13:05.667
And before this, for three days, they had set in mortar shells and tank and howitzers would hone in to all three of these locations in case we needed them.

13:06.187 --> 13:08.210
And so they were already zeroed in.

13:08.551 --> 13:14.981
And sure enough, at the third location, we did make contact with the enemy.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.085
I saw some coming down the ridge.

13:17.105 --> 13:18.567
First, I saw about eight of them.

13:19.469 --> 13:24.537
And while we were looking at them, we noticed a heard some noise on one of the sides.

13:24.657 --> 13:26.420
And there were several more over there.

13:29.405 --> 13:32.430
So anyway, we commenced the fire.

13:32.917 --> 13:39.334
And we had quite a battle, I guess the battle lasted about 20 minutes, but we were subsequently surrounded.

13:40.197 --> 13:44.007
So I had to have the ready reserve come break through and told the

13:45.877 --> 13:51.022
told the reserve people to take care of the ones that were on the left.

13:51.243 --> 13:55.127
So we didn't have to worry about them, but they engaged those.

13:56.288 --> 14:10.062
And we had several, several people were wounded and one of my BAR men, he was shot and I saw him go down and he jumped right back up again.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.722
I was firing and we had to go up.

14:15.183 --> 14:16.304
One of the other guys fell.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.187
I knew where he was.

14:19.287 --> 14:25.533
And so I crawled up and got him and drug him back where we could kind of take care of him.

14:25.633 --> 14:30.197
And the battle progressed and we were finally able to break through.

14:31.959 --> 14:41.128
And the reason why we were, we had to call fire in on ourselves because that was just a situation that was at hand.

14:41.665 --> 14:43.127
The artillery didn't want to do it.

14:44.289 --> 14:49.538
And I noticed they were slow coming back, so I got on the radio and just got a hold of the shocker and told him to come on in.

14:49.558 --> 14:53.324
He pinpointed and he said, well, you're there.

14:53.344 --> 14:55.548
And I said, yes, we've got to get out.

14:56.349 --> 15:00.636
And so he just came in and started firing right where he was supposed to.

15:01.595 --> 15:07.686
And I guess when the artillery and the howitzer saw what was going on, they came in too.

15:07.706 --> 15:12.234
And we had our own fire bursting all around us, but we were able to get through.

15:12.935 --> 15:16.842
And in the end, we killed 20 for sure and probably three more.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.088
And we were able to get two bodies back on them.

15:20.108 --> 15:24.676
We didn't catch any alive prisoners, but we were able to get some bodies back.

15:24.716 --> 15:25.898
But by the time we got back,

15:27.211 --> 15:31.971
Two of the lines was a fella that I dragged back was dead.

15:32.111 --> 15:34.943
We figured he was already dead.

15:35.716 --> 15:38.300
but we didn't leave him there.

15:39.762 --> 15:42.265
And that essentially is what happened.

15:42.305 --> 15:44.489
And you were awarded the Silver Star?

15:44.509 --> 15:50.778
I was awarded the Silver Star as was my BAR man for the same thing.

15:50.798 --> 15:51.759
He's the one that got shot.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.185
But he got up and he had quite a deep wound in his chest right here.

15:56.426 --> 15:58.669
And it got him through his flak jacket when he had got

15:58.649 --> 16:04.115
It turned and went through and got through and got part of his chest.

16:04.135 --> 16:09.641
I want all Aggies to understand what you're saying here because Ken Shockey was your platoon tank commander.

16:09.902 --> 16:10.542
Yes.

16:11.243 --> 16:16.509
You still credit him and what his platoon did for saving your life.

16:16.830 --> 16:17.070
Yes.

16:17.270 --> 16:20.474
As you wrote, that's the ultimate example of Aggies helping Aggies.

16:21.054 --> 16:26.040
As far as I'm concerned, he saved my life as well as the other people that came in from there.

16:27.455 --> 16:29.437
You're right here, Lieutenant Middleton.

16:31.400 --> 16:47.820
I was on my own now, a young, small town boy, a young, small town boy, suddenly put in charge of 55 men, at least half of whom were older than me, and all hoping and praying that this kid would make the right decisions and not botch things up and get us all killed.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.341
That was your thoughts back then.

16:49.361 --> 16:50.703
That was my thoughts when I first got there.

16:50.723 --> 16:51.464
And they were leery.

16:51.484 --> 16:52.605
There was pressure on you.

16:52.685 --> 16:54.187
Yeah, they were leery.

16:54.307 --> 16:56.550
I was 22 years old.

16:57.138 --> 17:03.468
I'd hate to put a group of people in charge of a 22-year-old, but that's the way it was.

17:04.430 --> 17:05.251
But that's the way it was.

17:05.431 --> 17:12.463
And during this battle, were you too busy to think, hey, I might get killed here?

17:12.483 --> 17:16.609
I mean, you were busy working to protect your troop and to protect yourself.

17:16.629 --> 17:19.234
I guess you were too busy to think about what could have happened.

17:19.254 --> 17:21.838
It never occurred to me until I got back.

17:21.858 --> 17:23.280
And then you realized where you had been.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.817
But it didn't occur to me.

17:25.857 --> 17:27.660
It doesn't occur to people.

17:28.081 --> 17:28.882
They got a job to do.

17:29.463 --> 17:30.324
They got a job to do.

17:30.344 --> 17:37.075
I want to go to some photographs from a scrapbook that your wife made for you about your service in Korea.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.118
And we're going to page through them.

17:39.138 --> 17:42.143
Wish we could show the entire scrapbook because it's amazing what your wife did.

17:42.944 --> 17:43.865
Talk about this picture.

17:44.066 --> 17:50.095
Here is obviously a young Latin Texas Aggie cadet, Bob Middleton.

17:50.210 --> 17:54.241
That's my senior picture, the official senior picture with my boots.

17:56.105 --> 17:57.990
They make them every year.

17:58.472 --> 18:01.339
Every year they make a picture of seniors in their boots.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.645
Actually, I have one of my grandson.

18:04.148 --> 18:07.692
in his boots and he has that particular picture in the background of it.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.135
So you can actually see both of those pictures.

18:10.175 --> 18:15.422
Panning out there and you can see there's the same senior boots that seniors wear today.

18:15.442 --> 18:16.743
That's the one, the same boots.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.627
They cost me $80 and now I think they're doing $900.

18:19.887 --> 18:23.452
Inflation has hit the actual senior boots.

18:23.472 --> 18:26.555
I paid $80 for the boots and $7 for the spurs.

18:26.595 --> 18:29.599
This is a page in the scrapbook.

18:30.676 --> 18:31.938
This is you and Ken Shockey?

18:31.958 --> 18:34.361
That's me and Ken Shockey in front of my command post.

18:36.044 --> 18:38.367
And that's where I lived, right behind there.

18:38.407 --> 18:43.555
And that's Ken on the left, and I'm the one on the right that's got the helmet over his eyes.

18:43.695 --> 18:47.661
And was that taken right there in the Mundung?

18:47.681 --> 18:49.344
Yes, that's in the Mundung knee valley.

18:49.564 --> 18:54.351
And any time you got out like that, you were subject to being shot at.

18:54.371 --> 18:58.337
They shot rifle fire at you.

18:58.739 --> 19:04.646
mortars, anything you take, anytime you went out there, you're getting shot at.

19:04.666 --> 19:08.812
I want to pan out now a little bit if we can and show a picture then that was taken.

19:09.592 --> 19:11.775
I'll lift this up so we can see it right here.

19:12.656 --> 19:14.539
This photograph was taken, what, a couple of years ago?

19:14.559 --> 19:21.287
Yes, it was taken about two years ago and that's, let me point out, that's Ken Shockey right there and there's me.

19:21.622 --> 19:25.227
in the same position as we were 52 years before.

19:25.347 --> 19:28.612
That's about 52 years after that other picture was taken.

19:28.692 --> 19:29.854
There you are, the same folks.

19:30.354 --> 19:31.536
That's an amazing photograph.

19:32.357 --> 19:37.545
And those are four Aggies that were in the 40th Infantry Division in the class of 51.

19:38.326 --> 19:39.648
Turn the page again.

19:39.688 --> 19:42.111
This is some newspaper clippings.

19:42.209 --> 19:47.158
about when you were awarded the Silver Star, another photograph of you, newspaper clippings.

19:47.178 --> 19:48.220
What paper was this from?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.522
Was this from Houston?

19:49.542 --> 19:58.538
Oh, that top one was from the Houston Post at the time, and then some of it was from the Tombaugh paper, and I think one of them was from the Palacios paper.

19:59.279 --> 20:00.081
We're very proud of you.

20:00.842 --> 20:02.164
Very proud of you, indeed.

20:02.725 --> 20:04.268
Going to fast forward through the album here.

20:04.619 --> 20:05.482
Talk about this picture.

20:05.502 --> 20:08.433
This was a reunion when you lived in Bay City.

20:08.473 --> 20:12.487
Yes, I moved from Bay City about two years ago.

20:12.547 --> 20:14.173
We lived in Matagorda County.

20:14.542 --> 20:20.612
And the county recognized on Veterans Day all the Korean veterans.

20:20.632 --> 20:24.118
And that's all the Korean veterans in Madagascar County that we could get together.

20:24.920 --> 20:32.312
And some of the people that I didn't know, but we all got acquainted.

20:32.873 --> 20:34.997
And that was just something the county did.

20:36.412 --> 20:42.000
I'm going to slip one picture right here and in front of here as we're going to go back so people can get an idea.

20:42.561 --> 20:43.923
This is a photo.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.545
Will you tell us, what is this photograph?

20:45.746 --> 20:50.793
That is a photograph of winter at Heartbreak Ridge.

20:50.853 --> 20:53.076
If you look, I'll point out this.

20:53.116 --> 20:55.380
This is the trenches, the front line trenches.

20:55.460 --> 20:58.765
It goes right here and across there and across.

20:59.906 --> 21:03.852
Actually, this went down across the valley and back up the other side.

21:03.872 --> 21:05.895
The valley doesn't show real good in that,

21:06.348 --> 21:07.609
The valley was right across here.

21:09.652 --> 21:11.954
And that's the way it looked in the wintertime.

21:12.495 --> 21:17.740
And any time we went out on patrol, we wore white covers.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.641
They called them whites.

21:19.983 --> 21:21.264
They were just like a sheet.

21:21.645 --> 21:22.626
Like a camouflage for the snow.

21:22.646 --> 21:26.350
You put the regular uniform and put that over, and then supposedly they couldn't see you.

21:26.390 --> 21:28.472
But I have my doubts.

21:28.552 --> 21:31.255
I think you can't hide from people like that.

21:31.836 --> 21:32.136
Yeah.

21:32.234 --> 21:35.842
And especially on a moonlight night, you can just see for miles on a moonlight night.

21:36.142 --> 21:37.545
Indeed, indeed.

21:37.565 --> 21:44.239
Your next mission in Korea, after Heartbreak Ridge, you were sent for a completely different kind of mission.

21:44.259 --> 21:44.861
Talk a little about it.

21:44.881 --> 21:45.823
You were sent to an island.

21:46.163 --> 21:46.464
Yes.

21:47.386 --> 21:50.833
We actually were replaced from the front line

21:51.303 --> 21:54.206
for training purposes.

21:54.226 --> 22:02.196
And after we'd been there just a little while, they had a prison uprising in Koji Doe Island.

22:03.558 --> 22:14.070
And Colonel Boatner, who was the commandant at Texas A&M the entire time I was here, he spent his four years, and he was sent to Korea.

22:16.058 --> 22:26.128
He was, the story goes that he was asked, they had an uprising and they caught the commandant of the prison.

22:26.168 --> 22:29.132
The American general was captured.

22:30.193 --> 22:35.378
And they couldn't hardly, I mean, they couldn't get him out.

22:35.398 --> 22:43.146
And so they called Hayden Boatner in and asked him, told him they wanted him to go down there and quilt that right and could he

22:43.565 --> 22:45.195
Did he think he could handle it?

22:45.275 --> 22:47.770
And he said, I spent four years

22:48.374 --> 22:53.159
working with Texas A&M Mother's Club, but I think I can handle that.

22:53.179 --> 22:56.942
Now, whether he said that or not, I don't know, but that's it.

22:57.603 --> 23:00.666
It sounds like a great thing to say.

23:00.686 --> 23:03.969
Talk a little bit more about what you did on this island as far as the POWs.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.952
There were 3,000 prisoners, mostly Chinese.

23:06.972 --> 23:11.277
No, they were actually 45,000 prisoners.

23:11.297 --> 23:12.418
On this island?

23:12.638 --> 23:13.639
On this one island.

23:14.024 --> 23:20.673
They're mostly Chinese, and some of them were North Koreans.

23:20.693 --> 23:25.420
But the ones that wanted to stay there, they had moved over on the mainland.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.825
But these were the bad ones over there.

23:28.845 --> 23:35.534
And they had broken them down in 5,000 to 10,000-man compounds, which is just too big.

23:36.495 --> 23:42.664
You can't handle 5,000 enemy at one time, even inside a barbed wire fence.

23:43.657 --> 23:47.942
Our job was to break them down into smaller compounds.

23:49.124 --> 23:49.985
We had to go down.

23:50.285 --> 23:55.252
And it had already been started when we got there, but they called for additional help.

23:55.572 --> 24:05.885
And our job was to break these prisoners into 500-man compounds and to keep them under surveillance all the time.

24:06.166 --> 24:06.847
Right, right.

24:06.867 --> 24:07.968
And you were able to do that?

24:07.988 --> 24:09.089
Yes.

24:09.290 --> 24:12.634
Talk about when you got the word that you were going to go home.

24:13.323 --> 24:14.184
You were on an LST.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.526
You were floating on an LST at the time.

24:15.546 --> 24:16.006
Yeah, they were.

24:16.887 --> 24:21.793
We had loaded on the LST, and we'd been relieved at Koji, and we was moving back, and we didn't know where we were going.

24:21.813 --> 24:24.497
We knew we were eventually going back to the front lines.

24:24.577 --> 24:39.395
Actually, the LST was pulling back, and the ramp was raised at about a 30-degree angle, and the Jeep pulled out in front.

24:39.455 --> 24:41.237
I was on the top deck looking down.

24:41.909 --> 24:46.760
And the lieutenant got out and he said, tell Lieutenant Middleton that if he can get off the ship, he can go home.

24:46.900 --> 24:47.722
We've got his orders.

24:47.782 --> 24:50.007
And it didn't take me long to get down.

24:50.047 --> 24:54.096
And I ran up that ramp and jumped in the water about knee deep.

24:54.116 --> 24:55.299
And I was able to get out though.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.083
And as it happened,

24:57.788 --> 25:06.841
I was put on the USS Marine links to go back home, and we were about five days out when the war ended.

25:06.981 --> 25:12.449
So actually the people that had pulled out, I guess they didn't make it back to the front lines.

25:12.870 --> 25:13.110
Right.

25:13.731 --> 25:20.041
I know you said that you had hoped that going over there you'd be on a slow boat, coming back you'd be on a fast plane, but it was just the opposite, is that right?

25:20.061 --> 25:21.122
It happened the opposite, obviously.

25:21.423 --> 25:22.184
You went home on a slow boat.

25:22.204 --> 25:27.171
That's the way my life goes anyway, but we make it.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.730
You leave active duty.

25:30.271 --> 25:31.192
You're at Fort Sam Houston.

25:31.212 --> 25:32.013
You leave active duty.

25:32.033 --> 25:33.275
You're in the reserves until 1964.

25:33.435 --> 25:34.436
That's right.

25:34.456 --> 25:37.540
And then your career, you followed in your dad's footsteps, right?

25:37.560 --> 25:39.423
You were in the oil business as a pipe liner.

25:39.443 --> 25:43.448
I was in the oil business, actually building and operating pipelines.

25:43.488 --> 25:51.538
And he was with Exxon, or Hummel at the time, and he retired as a pipe liner, and I went with the

25:51.518 --> 25:56.909
and became Mobile Oil Corporation for my career.

25:57.310 --> 25:59.174
Right, and you did an awful lot of traveling.

25:59.234 --> 26:04.565
You did more traveling, actually, in your post-military career than you did as a soldier.

26:04.585 --> 26:07.310
Yes, we built power lines and operated them.

26:08.293 --> 26:10.978
I actually worked in

26:10.958 --> 26:15.385
Norway, and Libya, and Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.

26:16.567 --> 26:18.931
Most of the time in the pipeline industry.

26:18.971 --> 26:21.115
Except for Qatar, I was in production then.

26:21.135 --> 26:22.577
That was my last assignment.

26:22.597 --> 26:25.162
Norway was cold, but not as cold as you remember Korea being, right?

26:25.182 --> 26:25.903
That's correct.

26:25.923 --> 26:29.268
I've spent three years in Norway, and I never did get as cold as I got cold.

26:29.549 --> 26:33.275
One night in Korea, it's cold in Korea.

26:33.956 --> 26:35.599
It's also hot.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.499
It gets hot and humid.

26:37.519 --> 26:38.840
I'm going to give you this, Lieutenant Middleton.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.964
I want you to hold it up sort of up there next to your shoulder and show folks.

26:43.065 --> 26:43.506
There you go.

26:43.606 --> 26:44.307
Hold it up high.

26:44.347 --> 26:46.189
That is your silver star.

26:46.209 --> 26:46.890
That's the silver star.

26:46.990 --> 26:47.530
There you go.

26:48.251 --> 26:49.733
Right there, just like it's pinned on your chest.

26:49.773 --> 26:51.455
I noticed that's something that you're very, very proud of.

26:51.475 --> 26:52.376
Yes, it is.

26:52.396 --> 26:57.762
But there's a lot of other people that maybe didn't get one, but they deserved it.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.884
That deserved it.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.907
This is something I'm proud of, yes.

27:02.005 --> 27:03.567
You certainly did deserve it.

27:03.587 --> 27:04.549
And thank you for your service.

27:04.569 --> 27:07.313
I wish we had more time, but thank you very much for being with us.

27:07.333 --> 27:10.958
It's my pleasure to be here, and I appreciate what you do to the veterans.

27:11.259 --> 27:12.821
Thank you, Lieutenant Bob Middleton.

27:13.102 --> 27:19.952
The Korean War probably earned its nickname, the Forgotten War, by its timing in history, sandwiched between World War II and Vietnam.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.036
But more than 33,000 Americans died in Korea.

27:23.177 --> 27:27.523
Another 92,000 were wounded, and more than 7,000 taken prisoner.

27:27.503 --> 27:34.954
It's certainly part of our historical landscape that should never be forgotten, nor the brave soldiers like Robert Middleton who fought there.

27:34.974 --> 27:40.683
We salute Bob Middleton for his service and thank all veterans, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:40.703 --> 27:41.584
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.348
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
