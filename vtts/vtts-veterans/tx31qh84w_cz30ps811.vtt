00:15.000 --> 00:31.000
[Music.]

00:35.278 --> 00:37.461
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:37.942 --> 00:39.083
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.058 --> 00:43.346
Brent Mullins has a passion that needs a place to call home.

00:43.366 --> 00:51.827
It's called the Museum of the American GI, and much of its contents have a temporary home in Brent Mullins' backyard in South College Station.

00:52.469 --> 00:57.882
The museum has an active website and a guy in charge who lives and breathes military history.

00:58.250 --> 01:02.015
For a living, Brent Mullins sells rare Jeep parts on the internet.

01:02.035 --> 01:08.422
But like I said, his passion is the Museum of the American GI, and you can help it become a reality.

01:08.442 --> 01:09.484
We'll talk about that later.

01:09.524 --> 01:11.366
First, I want to welcome Brent Mullins.

01:11.406 --> 01:12.687
Brent, it's an honor to have you.

01:12.707 --> 01:18.414
I've been wanting to have you on the show for a long time because we share this passion for the military and military history.

01:18.955 --> 01:21.718
Talk about the Museum of the American GI.

01:21.738 --> 01:24.001
It came out of your head, out of your passion.

01:24.381 --> 01:27.345
Sort of talk about its genesis and where it stands now.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.811
Well, I'd like to first thank you for having me on the show and for all the support that you've shown to our project over the past couple of years.

01:37.213 --> 01:45.165
The Museum of the American GI is a 501 non-profit corporation that was started in 2001.

01:45.145 --> 01:53.233
and the goals of the corporation is to establish a permanent military museum in College Station that has a unique purpose.

01:53.974 --> 02:10.950
Unlike most other military museums, we want to preserve the vehicles, the uniforms, the equipment, the memories of the servicemen and women of the United States, primarily the 20th century, but not necessarily limited to that.

02:11.065 --> 02:26.768
The thing that we feel that's going to make our museum unique among other military museums is that we have a significant, impressive collection of vehicles and mainly armored vehicles from the Second World War.

02:27.649 --> 02:30.313
And our vehicles are operational.

02:30.333 --> 02:37.123
Our vehicles have all been meticulously restored with great effort on my part and other dedicated

02:37.677 --> 02:55.123
people to the museum and once a year, at least once a year right now, maybe more often later, we have a field day or open house where we have a World War II battlefield reenactment with a large number of participants.

02:55.143 --> 03:01.913
We run our vehicles, we shoot the cannons, we shoot the machine guns, of course it's all blanks.

03:01.893 --> 03:10.382
and try and give the public a feel for what these things really sounded like, smelled like, looked like.

03:11.003 --> 03:23.636
You just get a three-dimensional idea of what it was like, you know, to see these things move under their own power, which is a unique thing 60 years down the road.

03:23.656 --> 03:24.797
It's really fascinating.

03:24.877 --> 03:25.458
It is.

03:26.299 --> 03:30.583
Your love of military history obviously came, it's a family thing.

03:30.952 --> 03:34.337
Your dad was Burt Mullins, who sadly we lost back in April.

03:34.958 --> 03:40.126
And your brother, Burt, served in Vietnam as a Marine, as you also were a Marine.

03:40.347 --> 03:41.528
Talk a little bit about your dad.

03:41.749 --> 03:45.214
He flew the B-17, the Flying Portrait, 30 missions over Germany, I believe.

03:45.535 --> 03:45.995
That's right.

03:46.056 --> 03:56.672
My dad was in the 8th Air Force, the 91st Bomb Group, 323rd Squadron, which was the same group that the famous Memphis Belle was in.

03:57.057 --> 04:12.288
He flew 30 missions as a tail gunner and including some really horrific missions like the bombing of Stettine and the ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt.

04:12.890 --> 04:14.593
And he was on the first Berlin raid.

04:15.569 --> 04:21.317
And I believe I also read that he actually flew over Normandy Beach on D-Day, looked down and saw it all happening.

04:21.597 --> 04:24.301
That was an unauthorized flight, yes.

04:25.342 --> 04:34.315
He just happened to be milling around that morning, and someone said, let's go fly and look at the big invasion.

04:34.335 --> 04:40.103
And they needed a full crew, and he set the tail gunner seat, and they flew over, and he saw the whole thing.

04:40.463 --> 04:40.904
My goodness.

04:41.464 --> 04:44.108
I know that it's not what you came here to talk about, but...

04:44.847 --> 04:48.664
Your passion for the Museum of the American GI doesn't make a living for you.

04:48.804 --> 04:50.793
You make a living in a very unique way.

04:50.813 --> 04:52.360
Talk about your business.

04:52.525 --> 05:02.215
Well, it sounds like an odd business to most people, but I've had this passion for military things ever since I can remember.

05:02.235 --> 05:06.179
And I always had a keen sense for business too.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.502
When I was in high school, I collected uniforms.

05:09.822 --> 05:14.607
I would go to gun shows, surplus stores, every place else I could find things.

05:14.627 --> 05:21.874
When I found something that I thought was good, I bought all of it and would sell it.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.637
so I could buy more things that I wanted.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.741
One thing led to another.

05:26.841 --> 05:28.143
I finally got a Jeep.

05:28.444 --> 05:32.249
I wanted a Jeep real bad when I was 16 years old.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.596
I taught myself how to do everything on it.

05:36.716 --> 05:40.782
That led to what is now my career as a Jeep parts business.

05:41.463 --> 05:43.646
I have a business called Brent Mullins Jeep Parts.

05:44.267 --> 05:46.550
We sell worldwide.

05:46.931 --> 05:51.237
We have a website that we have all of our wares listed on.

05:51.217 --> 05:54.561
and I have quite an extensive inventory of

05:55.013 --> 05:57.335
mainly World War II Jeep parts.

05:57.355 --> 06:01.039
When he says extensive inventory, he really means that I've been out there, folks.

06:01.460 --> 06:09.928
And as a matter of fact, there's an organization, a worldwide organization, I guess, called the Military Vehicle Preservation Association, and they have meetings every year.

06:09.989 --> 06:10.789
You attend those.

06:10.869 --> 06:13.933
So that's where you drum up some business, I take it, right?

06:14.113 --> 06:14.533
That's right.

06:15.414 --> 06:20.660
The Military Vehicle Preservation Association is a worldwide organization.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.923
It has about 10 or 12,000 members, I think.

06:24.562 --> 06:28.728
And we have an annual convention at different locations in the U.S.

06:28.749 --> 06:41.649
And people bring their restored military vehicles and they're judged and they have a big flea market and seminars and all sorts of things dealing with antique military vehicles.

06:41.669 --> 06:46.055
Brent Mullins' backyard is not just any old backyard.

06:46.116 --> 06:49.641
It's got, what, how many, three warehouses, I believe, in your backyard or more?

06:50.060 --> 06:55.890
and just some things scattered out in the yard, and we're going to show you what we're talking about now.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.873
We've got an array of photographs.

06:57.934 --> 07:00.398
I went out to Brent's place a couple of weeks ago.

07:00.418 --> 07:05.406
It's about the third time that I've been out there, and I took some photographs, and we're going to go through them, and Brent's going to talk about them.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.450
So let's get going, and here we go.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.772
This is in one of your warehouses.

07:08.812 --> 07:09.874
What are we looking at, Brent?

07:10.141 --> 07:14.468
This is a 1942 Stewart M5A1 light tank.

07:14.948 --> 07:22.560
It has three 30 caliber machine guns on it and the main cannon is a 37 millimeter semi-automatic gun.

07:23.681 --> 07:28.909
It's fully restored, operational, that it's, you know, of course will be in the museum.

07:30.632 --> 07:37.262
It's powered by two Cadillac flathead V8 engines and it's a really good piece.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.262
Beautifully, beautifully restored also.

07:39.322 --> 07:42.386
Okay, let's move on to the next photograph.

07:42.506 --> 07:42.887
Here we are.

07:43.608 --> 07:49.856
Sitting in the middle back there, that's a 1943 Sherman M4A1 medium tank.

07:51.678 --> 07:54.682
This tank right here would be your classic D-Day tank.

07:55.763 --> 07:58.107
This is the mainstay of the U.S.

07:58.127 --> 08:01.070
Army at that time period.

08:02.112 --> 08:06.237
It's powered by a nine-cylinder radial aircraft engine.

08:06.959 --> 08:22.760
This particular tank was built by Montreal Locomotive Works and has a one-piece cast hull which only railroad manufacturers had the capabilities of doing at that time.

08:22.780 --> 08:23.803
Amazing, okay.

08:25.184 --> 08:29.068
This is a Ford-built M8 light armored car.

08:29.269 --> 08:33.794
It's a six-wheeled, six-by-six vehicle.

08:33.814 --> 08:38.199
It's powered by a six-cylinder Hercules gasoline engine.

08:39.981 --> 08:52.795
It has a 30 caliber machine gun, which is coaxially mounted by the main cannon, which is also a 37 millimeter, and it has a 50 caliber machine gun for any aircraft use on the turret.

08:53.585 --> 08:55.848
Now where did you come up with this?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.811
Where did you acquire this particular piece?

08:58.392 --> 09:13.392
This particular armored car I've owned for nearly 15 years and I found it in a junkyard up in Dallas that had at one time about six of them and the story was they acquired them in the early 60s.

09:13.432 --> 09:19.761
They had been confiscated and they were on their way to Cuba right after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

09:19.910 --> 09:31.685
And when Castro took over, the State Department stopped exports to Cuba, and somehow these ended up in the junkyard, which was fortunate for me.

09:31.925 --> 09:33.247
Any idea who Miss Emily is?

09:34.008 --> 09:34.688
That's my daughter.

09:35.189 --> 09:35.650
Oh, okay.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.511
You put that on there.

09:36.551 --> 09:37.532
I didn't know where that was.

09:37.552 --> 09:38.713
You found it like that?

09:39.655 --> 09:41.517
So that's a personalized tank there.

09:41.677 --> 09:42.939
It is, yeah.

09:42.959 --> 09:43.239
Okay, great.

09:43.800 --> 09:48.786
Let's move on to the... This is a...

09:49.070 --> 09:55.058
1944 Buick built M18 tank destroyer.

09:55.078 --> 09:58.103
This was the best tank destroyer in World War II.

09:58.623 --> 10:05.253
It had a 76 millimeter main gun and a 50 caliber anti-aircraft machine gun.

10:06.334 --> 10:08.137
It's a tank destroyer, not a tank.

10:08.758 --> 10:12.623
What makes it different than a tank is it's very lightly armored.

10:12.643 --> 10:14.065
It has an open top turret.

10:14.888 --> 10:16.571
And it was very fast.

10:16.871 --> 10:21.959
In fact, this was the fastest track vehicle of any vehicle in World War II.

10:22.379 --> 10:27.927
It was capable of speeds up to 55 miles an hour, which is quite fast for a track vehicle.

10:28.709 --> 10:34.017
It's quite fast for anything, because that's about how you go on the highway when you're going from one place to another.

10:34.337 --> 10:36.040
Maybe a little bit faster, but not much.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.026
That's moving a whole lot of heavy armor and moving it quickly.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.731
All right, let's move on to the next photograph.

10:44.251 --> 10:47.776
This is the M4A1 Sherman again, just a different angle.

10:48.397 --> 10:52.523
You can get a good look at that great big single cast hull.

10:53.845 --> 11:00.935
This tank weighs 60,000 pounds and this particular tank has not been restored yet.

11:01.075 --> 11:02.738
I got it just like this.

11:04.260 --> 11:07.044
We plan on starting restoration on it next year.

11:08.806 --> 11:09.988
We'll tear it down, you know,

11:10.711 --> 11:13.173
naked to the bare hull and start over on it.

11:13.614 --> 11:15.435
But it does run and drive right now.

11:16.716 --> 11:23.943
That's an incredible part is everything that you're seeing now is part of your reenactment that you do each year and they run.

11:24.203 --> 11:28.147
You can start them up and move them out of the warehouses.

11:28.447 --> 11:29.688
Okay, let's move on to the next.

11:31.310 --> 11:35.373
This is another front picture of the Ford M8 armored car.

11:38.036 --> 11:40.498
This armored car has

11:40.833 --> 11:47.565
you know, all live guns on it, which, you know, requires a license for us to be able to do that.

11:48.467 --> 11:55.540
But it's quite impressive to see these, the tank guns, the tank cannons fire at the reenactment.

11:59.347 --> 12:00.268
Now we move outside.

12:00.529 --> 12:01.170
You have...

12:01.437 --> 12:03.620
You don't have room for everything inside your warehouses.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.841
You've got a lot out in the yard.

12:05.442 --> 12:05.662
Right.

12:05.682 --> 12:11.149
This is a 1945 Sherman M4A3E8.

12:11.570 --> 12:16.756
This is the last basically evolution of the Sherman.

12:16.776 --> 12:27.630
It has much wider track, a different angle to the front of the hull, a much bigger turret, and it would have had a 76 millimeter cannon in it.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.470
We're going to restore this tank.

12:30.490 --> 12:32.533
We haven't gotten to it yet.

12:33.454 --> 12:38.420
So we will have an early version of the Sherman and the very last version of the Sherman.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.683
Let me ask you now, we're taking a look at a picture of this.

12:41.064 --> 12:45.850
Somebody would look at that and look at the tanks we saw earlier and say, hey, this is in pretty bad shape.

12:46.571 --> 12:48.293
What does it take?

12:48.333 --> 12:51.297
How do you even start to restore something like that?

12:51.377 --> 12:54.681
Obviously, it's got missing parts, missing a gun barrel.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.465
How do you restore something like that?

12:58.728 --> 13:00.410
Well, it's like everything else.

13:01.992 --> 13:07.278
If you're really into collecting something, you know everyone else who's also interested in that.

13:07.298 --> 13:10.942
And we network, you know, basically for the parts and such.

13:10.962 --> 13:16.248
And I do have a lot of the parts because I've been in it, you know, quite a long time.

13:16.568 --> 13:18.310
I don't see any real challenges there.

13:18.851 --> 13:21.934
In fact, I think that things in remarkably

13:22.184 --> 13:25.427
complete in good shape compared to some of the other stuff we've tackled.

13:25.447 --> 13:30.632
A year from now I'm going to come take a picture of it and see what it looks like and we'll put it on again.

13:30.652 --> 13:37.859
Now speaking of restoration, here's one of your folks that works for you and that's just a couple of weeks ago when we took this picture.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.722
That was restoration of a tank in another warehouse.

13:40.762 --> 13:41.983
Talk about what he's doing there.

13:42.704 --> 13:50.672
Well this is a 1945 Cadillac built M24 Chaffee light tank.

13:51.074 --> 13:56.361
It's also powered by two flathead V8 Cadillac engines.

13:56.501 --> 14:01.547
It has a 75 millimeter main gun which is not installed at the moment.

14:01.567 --> 14:09.237
We have been working on this tank for a little over a year and started with a naked hull.

14:09.257 --> 14:18.128
This tank originally came to us from Norway and had been given, I guess, to the Norwegian government after World War II for foreign aid.

14:18.867 --> 14:20.409
It was a real hulk.

14:20.769 --> 14:22.772
It was missing a tremendous amount of parts.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.257
And we managed to find everything.

14:26.277 --> 14:28.760
I'm not really missing anything now.

14:28.780 --> 14:36.550
And it's in the final stages of restoration after having had to rebuild every last thing on it.

14:36.570 --> 14:41.957
It's been quite an ordeal, but it's really coming together nicely now.

14:41.977 --> 14:48.065
And I expect to be done with it in probably another 30 days.

14:48.085 --> 14:48.165
Wow.

14:49.411 --> 14:50.252
Now we go outside.

14:50.272 --> 14:52.194
Here's one of your guns.

14:52.214 --> 14:53.616
This gun is a unique gun.

14:53.636 --> 14:57.841
It mounts on a half track.

14:58.702 --> 15:01.666
It was the first attempt at a tank destroyer by the Army.

15:03.188 --> 15:10.557
This gun is on loan to us from the Armor and Cavalry Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.820
It originally had been set as a monument.

15:12.900 --> 15:17.005
You can still see remnants of the concrete around the bottom.

15:17.255 --> 15:29.600
in return for restoring this gun for the Army Museum, they let us borrow it so that we can copy a lot of the parts off of it for our own half-track restoration.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.163
Alright, let's move on.

15:32.729 --> 15:39.758
This is the mainstay artillery of the US Army from about 1940 to the mid-1980s.

15:39.978 --> 15:42.602
This is a 105 millimeter howitzer.

15:44.304 --> 15:51.894
The Army and Marine Corps had thousands and thousands of these guns and they are all gone now.

15:52.515 --> 15:58.583
They're quite rare in any sort of civilian hands.

15:59.063 --> 16:02.027
This is a live registered

16:02.530 --> 16:06.134
destructive device according to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

16:06.956 --> 16:11.501
We shoot this at our annual reenactments.

16:11.521 --> 16:15.646
It's a really good piece, and we're really glad to have it.

16:15.666 --> 16:18.790
It was built in 1943.

16:18.970 --> 16:30.184
We don't know where it saw service, but we have every little accessory for it, and it's a very complete, very nice gun.

16:30.204 --> 16:32.267
And that's another angle of it.

16:32.855 --> 16:52.180
Also, the vehicle that's sitting in front of it is a 1943 International Harvester-built high-speed tractor, and its purpose was to tow the artillery, carry the ammunition, and the crew, and this particular vehicle weighs 13 tons.

16:52.430 --> 17:04.643
It has a ring mount on top with a 50-caliber machine gun for any aircraft protection, and it would carry about eight men in it, and it has provisions to carry the ammunition, and it would tow this 105 Howitzer.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.026
Just amazing.

17:08.087 --> 17:14.333
Now this is, when I come out to your house, this is what I just sit and am in awe of.

17:14.754 --> 17:19.939
This is a Higgins boat, and people who have knowledge of history of World War II,

17:20.392 --> 17:23.018
know a little bit about this from the landing of Normandy.

17:23.118 --> 17:25.944
Talk about this and how in the world did you get one of these?

17:25.964 --> 17:32.578
I think you told me one time, as far as you know, there are only six in existence worldwide and you have one of them in your yard.

17:33.470 --> 17:38.841
Well, I'm not so sure about the six, but they're quite scarce.

17:38.941 --> 17:45.594
This is technically referred to as an LCVP, which stands for Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel.

17:47.017 --> 17:48.840
It's 36 feet long.

17:49.421 --> 17:53.790
It had a Gray Marine 671 Detroit diesel engine in it.

17:54.631 --> 18:01.537
It would carry approximately 30 combat-loaded troops, or it would carry a light vehicle such as a Jeep.

18:03.559 --> 18:05.040
It's all made out of wood.

18:05.861 --> 18:08.443
Most people don't realize that, that they were wood.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.627
They did have an armor plate on the side to protect the cargo compartment.

18:13.007 --> 18:13.547
That's all.

18:15.489 --> 18:16.490
They're quite scarce.

18:17.131 --> 18:18.932
This one has not been restored.

18:18.952 --> 18:24.537
We found this in a marine salvage yard out in San Francisco.

18:24.989 --> 18:26.852
trucked it back here.

18:26.872 --> 18:35.444
We have another one that we're negotiating on right now for parts and this is coming up real soon.

18:35.484 --> 18:45.057
We want to get busy on restoring this and eventually you know put it in a lake and swim it at least a couple times.

18:45.077 --> 18:49.483
Folks I guarantee you Brent Mullins is the only resident of the Brazos Valley with a Higgins boat in his backyard.

18:49.904 --> 18:50.845
What are we looking at here?

18:51.230 --> 18:54.213
This is a Ford-built amphibious Jeep.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.435
It's under restoration right now.

18:56.455 --> 18:57.816
We're about halfway done with it.

18:57.856 --> 18:59.598
It's a quite rare vehicle.

18:59.998 --> 19:05.043
It's basically a boat on a Jeep.

19:05.223 --> 19:13.931
Ford built 12,000 of these, which sounds like a lot, but they're really rare now because anything that'll float will also hold water.

19:13.951 --> 19:19.836
So they're all rusted out and junk pretty much, the ones that haven't been sunk.

19:20.120 --> 19:28.090
Just as a comparison, there were 600,000 Jeeps built during World War II and 12,000 of these amphibious Jeeps.

19:28.831 --> 19:36.861
And this is a really fine example that we have right here that we'll probably have this restored by March is the plan.

19:38.183 --> 19:39.244
All right.

19:39.264 --> 19:39.965
Speaking of a Jeep.

19:40.746 --> 19:44.391
Well, that's a three-quarter ton Dodge weapons carrier.

19:44.431 --> 19:48.456
That was the standard three-quarter ton truck in World War II.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.759
It has a six-cylinder Dodge flathead engine in it.

19:54.321 --> 19:57.864
That vehicle's been restored for about 12 years.

19:57.884 --> 20:07.834
We actually took this vehicle to Europe in 1994 and drove it 1,600 miles on the continent for the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.

20:07.914 --> 20:08.875
Wow.

20:08.895 --> 20:09.575
That's amazing.

20:09.916 --> 20:15.321
I apologize to the Dodge people for calling their vehicle a Jeep, but it didn't look like a Dodge.

20:15.908 --> 20:20.495
This is a wrecker that belonged to the museum and you can also see another wrecker behind it.

20:20.575 --> 20:39.342
This is a early 1970's M816 five-ton wrecker that we just used for some of the heavy work we do and behind it there is a 1944 World War II Ward La France seven-ton heavy wrecker.

20:39.362 --> 20:42.507
And we have been known to use both of them for

20:42.824 --> 20:44.406
moving a lot of this heavy stuff around.

20:44.887 --> 20:46.870
Those are your workhorses right there.

20:46.890 --> 20:50.736
This, I take it, is probably the rarest piece in your collection.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.799
Talk about what we're looking at.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.262
This may well be the rarest piece.

20:55.282 --> 20:58.367
This is a 1918 Liberty truck.

20:58.387 --> 21:02.573
This was the first standardized truck that the U.S.

21:02.593 --> 21:04.336
Army tried to develop.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.221
We found this up in a barn in Montana.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.346
It's in completely untouched original condition.

21:11.663 --> 21:15.148
Still the original paint, the original wood bed on it.

21:17.332 --> 21:18.654
Original tires?

21:18.674 --> 21:19.655
Yes, the original.

21:19.836 --> 21:20.777
Hard rubber tires?

21:20.937 --> 21:22.059
Solid rubber tires, yes.

21:22.079 --> 21:23.782
Didn't make for much of a smooth ride, I guess.

21:24.303 --> 21:25.785
But it beat the heck out of walking.

21:25.805 --> 21:26.887
Indeed.

21:27.447 --> 21:32.355
Now, it's hard to see, but talk about its cargo back in the back.

21:32.825 --> 21:37.451
That's the limber for our French 75 field gun.

21:37.792 --> 21:51.771
We have a model 1897 French 75 gun, which was the standard American artillery piece for the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. And that's the limber for it.

21:51.791 --> 21:55.356
This is just some... I just took that picture because I thought it...

21:55.910 --> 21:58.073
It looked like what Brett Mullins does.

21:58.133 --> 22:00.777
He collects things and puts them in his yard.

22:00.797 --> 22:03.481
This is actually some stuff that has to do with my business.

22:03.521 --> 22:07.387
These are three-quarter ton military cargo trailers that we sell.

22:08.949 --> 22:09.129
Okay.

22:10.191 --> 22:12.334
Now that needs some restoration, Brett.

22:12.354 --> 22:13.075
Yes, it does.

22:13.095 --> 22:19.704
But that looks like a really easy restoration project compared to some of the other ones we've done.

22:20.245 --> 22:24.972
This is a 1942 auto car built half track.

22:25.407 --> 22:27.390
This is actually a tank destroyer.

22:27.951 --> 22:31.577
That's, as we mentioned, the gun that we're doing for the Army.

22:32.037 --> 22:42.634
We're going to mount our gun in this one and actually have a running, functioning, the first Army tank destroyer.

22:42.654 --> 22:50.547
That will be the only one in the world that we're aware of that will be running and driving and restored back to original.

22:50.967 --> 22:51.448
Okay, let's move on.

22:51.985 --> 22:55.108
You have a Huey helicopter in your yard from Vietnam, I guess.

22:55.128 --> 22:55.668
Yes, we do.

22:55.728 --> 22:57.410
This is the Air Force model Huey.

22:57.430 --> 22:59.011
This is a TH1.

22:59.992 --> 23:05.457
Originally, it's very similar to the Army models, a little shorter fuselage and a different engine.

23:05.877 --> 23:16.287
It was originally used by the Air Force to move their personnel out to their missile sites, such as the Air Force operated all these missile sites over the U.S.

23:16.347 --> 23:19.950
in remote locations, and they would move their personnel

23:20.538 --> 23:24.709
and this Air Force model Huey.

23:24.729 --> 23:26.473
And that's scheduled for restoration.

23:26.493 --> 23:28.659
I know you have the blades over off to the side.

23:29.561 --> 23:29.642
Yes.

23:30.323 --> 23:31.406
Pretty remarkable piece.

23:32.489 --> 23:34.354
I think the next picture, yeah we're going to move indoors.

23:34.394 --> 23:37.602
You are also a collector of uniforms and you have quite a collection.

23:38.172 --> 23:48.127
This is just some of our stuff, really a very small amount of the uniforms and, you know, ordinance items that we have that will be in the museum.

23:48.808 --> 23:55.017
The mannequin that you see there is dressed in a standard paratrooper uniform.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.412
from World War II from the 101st Airborne.

23:59.354 --> 24:09.350
And you can see all, and to the mannequins left there on the floor is a 60 millimeter mortar, the standard infantry mortar from World War II.

24:11.393 --> 24:18.625
We have quite a number of uniforms and ordnance items that will be in the museum.

24:18.645 --> 24:19.266
What is that?

24:19.651 --> 24:22.414
That is a PBR, Patrol Boat River.

24:22.794 --> 24:32.283
That is the famous Vietnam-era river patrol boat that was, you may have seen, if you've ever seen the movie Apocalypse Now, they're water skiing behind one.

24:34.145 --> 24:42.933
We have a complete functional PBR that will be one of the centerpieces for our Vietnam display.

24:43.794 --> 24:47.177
And it's a completely functional vehicle and...

24:47.528 --> 24:54.042
Hopefully a couple times we might take it out and take a run in it in the river or something.

24:54.062 --> 24:55.144
And that's Burt Mullins.

24:55.164 --> 24:55.685
That's your dad.

24:55.705 --> 24:57.088
I wanted to include that here.

24:57.108 --> 25:03.641
We talked about him earlier and quite a distinguished veteran and man that I know you're very proud of.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.347
And I appreciate you for mentioning him.

25:08.167 --> 25:11.255
Wow, and this is all in South College Station, folks.

25:12.097 --> 25:13.962
Let's talk, we've got just a couple of minutes left.

25:14.143 --> 25:17.491
In March, you're having your open house, and you want to invite the public out there.

25:17.511 --> 25:18.955
Talk just a little bit about that.

25:19.296 --> 25:20.459
Public's invited.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.948
Any scouts that come out in uniform get in free.

25:23.928 --> 25:28.574
It'll be about, I think, at 1.30, Saturday, March the 25th.

25:30.136 --> 25:33.259
We have a big military, a flea market going on out there.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.203
If they want to come earlier, then take a look at that.

25:36.223 --> 25:39.767
And then at 1.30, the big reenactment starts.

25:39.787 --> 25:44.052
And I think this is about the only place you can see something like that in the South.

25:44.253 --> 25:47.417
That'll be in March, and we'll have you back on before that to talk about it.

25:47.737 --> 25:49.079
We need to tell people where you are.

25:49.099 --> 25:52.703
You actually already have the land for the Museum of the American GI.

25:53.054 --> 25:57.441
You're just looking for the help to build the actual building itself.

25:57.461 --> 26:00.686
And tell them exactly where it's located out on Highway 6 South.

26:00.706 --> 26:08.599
We're just south of Santa's Wonderland, about a quarter of a mile on the same side of the access road as Santa's Wonderland.

26:08.579 --> 26:17.008
We've been promised help from the architecture department at A&M, and we just need some interstructure.

26:17.028 --> 26:17.689
We have the land.

26:17.709 --> 26:18.991
We have the collection.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.112
We just need a building.

26:20.132 --> 26:23.376
Take the Texas World Speedway exit and just stay on the access road, and there you are.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.398
I want to put your website up on the screen.

26:25.578 --> 26:31.785
It's very easy, www.museumoftheamericangi.org.

26:32.069 --> 26:35.712
And thank you for being with us, and thank you for letting us tell your story.

26:35.933 --> 26:37.314
It's a remarkable story.

26:37.334 --> 26:37.994
Thank you, Tom.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.716
All right, thank you.

26:39.736 --> 26:43.640
You've seen that Brent Mullins has no ordinary backyard.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.483
A Higgins boat, several battle tanks, a UA helicopter, and a whole lot more.

26:48.024 --> 26:52.408
And all they need is a home, and that will be the Museum of the American GI.

26:52.428 --> 26:56.672
For more information, go to the website, museumoftheamericangi.com.

26:56.692 --> 27:01.536
Please thank a veteran today, and thanks to our underwriter, First American Bank.

27:01.972 --> 27:03.484
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:03.505 --> 27:06.126
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:06.126 --> 27:11.000
[Silence.]

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
[Music.]
