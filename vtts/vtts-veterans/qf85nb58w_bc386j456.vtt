00:12.603 --> 00:37.232
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:37.252 --> 00:38.273
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:39.198 --> 00:45.790
By the end of World War II, Captain Edward Kozlowski had flown 88 missions over the combat territory of the European theater.

00:46.452 --> 00:52.663
His planes had been shot down on more than a few occasions, each time escaping capture by uncommon means.

00:52.683 --> 00:56.751
His life's path took him from his boyhood farm home in Wisconsin.

00:56.731 --> 01:05.843
through his military service as a pathfinder, navigator, to Houston, NASA, where he designed and installed the heat shields used on the Apollo missions.

01:06.263 --> 01:11.750
But perhaps his most rewarding mission was that to win the heart of Yolanda Frisch Army Nurse Corps.

01:12.471 --> 01:13.833
It too was no easy challenge.

01:14.093 --> 01:23.565
Yolanda Frisch of the 100th Evacuation Hospital always set up near the front lines following Patton's army through France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany.

01:23.545 --> 01:25.651
a triage nurse, a surgical nurse.

01:26.273 --> 01:29.763
Both former Texas A&M employees now retired in Bryan.

01:29.784 --> 01:36.002
They are indeed testament to the bravery and determination of all those men and women who served for freedom.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.864
Please meet Captain and Captain Ed and Yolanda Kozlowski.

01:39.884 --> 01:42.107
What an honor it is to have you both here.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.690
I want to fast forward to when you all met.

01:45.771 --> 01:51.218
In 1947, you all got married, but talk about how you all met, where you all met.

01:51.498 --> 01:53.801
It was during the height of the war in the European theater.

01:54.161 --> 01:56.124
Yolanda, what do you remember about it?

01:56.144 --> 02:00.589
Well, I remember going to a dance and meeting my husband-to-be.

02:01.143 --> 02:06.103
And after we got through with the dance and on our way home, he asked me to write him.

02:06.123 --> 02:11.203
And I said I would write him just like he was my brother, which I did.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.182
What do you remember?

02:13.222 --> 02:14.384
How did the party come to be?

02:14.465 --> 02:15.727
It was after D-Day, right?

02:15.747 --> 02:16.809
It was after D-Day.

02:16.829 --> 02:20.818
We had been flying for four days almost consecutively.

02:20.978 --> 02:29.255
As we'd fly the mission, come back and get briefed and maybe catch three, four hours of sleep and take off again.

02:29.957 --> 02:33.023
But on the fourth day, the CO says, well,

02:33.442 --> 02:35.027
Today we're going to have a party.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.638
I kept saying, what, you can't have a party without women?

02:39.641 --> 02:42.189
And they said, well, we kind of took care of that.

02:42.610 --> 02:47.164
What it was was that they had a contingent of nurses.

02:47.718 --> 02:50.983
coming down from Blackpool, England, down to Southampton.

02:51.864 --> 02:57.972
And they were going to spend the night somewhere near our airfield.

02:58.033 --> 03:04.381
So we sent some trucks over to pick them up and bring them over.

03:05.403 --> 03:09.348
Well, the trucks got lost a little bit in the dark.

03:09.368 --> 03:16.138
And by the time the trucks came back, a lot of us had imbibed a little in the...

03:16.608 --> 03:24.425
at the bar, so we were pretty wide-eyed, and I'm not too sure that the nurses were ready to stop over.

03:25.547 --> 03:28.494
But after that evening, you all talked, you got to know each other.

03:28.674 --> 03:29.697
You didn't really see each other.

03:30.538 --> 03:30.679
No.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.162
How did you communicate after that?

03:32.342 --> 03:32.623
Letters.

03:33.124 --> 03:34.186
Letters.

03:34.427 --> 03:34.988
Female.

03:35.677 --> 03:37.039
Well, letters, email.

03:37.219 --> 03:38.000
Right, right.

03:38.461 --> 03:44.430
And because actually you were sort of one step ahead of him sort of through the rest of the war.

03:44.530 --> 03:48.236
He'd be one spot, you'd just been there, you'd move to another spot.

03:48.256 --> 03:48.736
Is that right?

03:48.756 --> 03:49.798
That's right.

03:49.818 --> 03:53.624
Whenever he came to the airfield, he'd ask where we were and we had just moved away from there.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.728
And then he'd come to another airfield and we had moved.

03:56.748 --> 03:59.492
So he kept chasing me.

03:59.512 --> 04:02.016
And he finally got you.

04:02.036 --> 04:03.478
Yolanda was the Army Nurse Corps.

04:03.498 --> 04:05.481
Of course, you were Army Air Corps.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.747
I want to talk about your career.

04:07.787 --> 04:12.974
You grew up in a farm in Wisconsin, and it was something that happened on that farm, I believe you told me, that first got you hooked on flying.

04:12.994 --> 04:13.455
What happened?

04:14.176 --> 04:23.169
Well, we had a plane come over, or a man come over to ask my father if he could land his plane on our pasture.

04:23.269 --> 04:24.431
And my father said, yeah.

04:24.591 --> 04:29.719
He said, well, I'll give you a ride in the airplane.

04:29.759 --> 04:34.506
This was an old bi-wing, open-pit,

04:34.486 --> 04:49.920
open cockpit plane and he sat in the front and the passenger sat in the back and so he gave me a ride and right then and there I said goodbye farm I'm ready to fly.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.481
You were ready to go.

04:52.061 --> 04:53.843
You were commissioned December 1st 1941.

04:53.983 --> 05:00.469
Of course six days later the world changed obviously on December 7th with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

05:00.489 --> 05:03.271
I think you were scheduled for a leave but that leave got cancelled.

05:03.672 --> 05:04.172
Talk about

05:04.574 --> 05:06.358
What happened to you after Pearl Harbor?

05:07.641 --> 05:11.009
Well, after Pearl Harbor, you mean... Right.

05:11.710 --> 05:15.900
You changed your direction a little bit and went off to Europe, right?

05:15.920 --> 05:16.401
That's right.

05:16.481 --> 05:21.452
When my orders were changed, I was to go home for 10 days and they...

05:22.124 --> 05:26.409
Instead I wound up in Maxton, North Carolina with some B-17s.

05:27.810 --> 05:31.494
And they filled up the plane with 27 navigators.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.980
And we all flew to England.

05:38.222 --> 05:43.627
And we landed near Oxford University at a little field there.

05:43.647 --> 05:51.456
And for six weeks we were taught by the RAF

05:53.005 --> 06:06.795
getting familiar with their radar sets and their radar navigation that they had covered Europe with so that we could have a more pinpoint

06:07.366 --> 06:17.207
location of where we were at any time we were traveling, which worked for a while, but then the Germans got real wise and began to jam it pretty badly.

06:17.327 --> 06:24.743
So once we got over Europe, about 200 miles inside the borders, we were pretty much on our own.

06:25.444 --> 06:27.248
The radar did not help us too much.

06:27.363 --> 06:37.516
When you were transported with those 27 other Pathfinder navigators, I believe you said that it was Christmas Eve, and you all sang Silent Night on the way over the North Atlantic, is that right?

06:37.536 --> 06:54.197
Well, yeah, we left on Christmas Eve, and around midnight somebody said, well, we're over the ocean, and he started to sing Silent Night, and by the time he was through, I think everybody on the plane had a...

06:54.177 --> 06:55.946
a tear or two in his eye.

06:56.007 --> 06:56.670
Absolutely.

06:56.952 --> 07:00.289
You were young kids, didn't know where you were headed or what you were in for.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.584
You didn't fly as a Pathfinder Navigator.

07:03.604 --> 07:04.946
You didn't fly just one aircraft.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.150
You were experienced in B-17s, B-24s, other aircraft.

07:08.171 --> 07:08.631
That's right.

07:10.013 --> 07:19.046
I was transferred from one group to the other, whichever was going to fly a particular mission.

07:20.568 --> 07:24.994
So I didn't really stay at one air base for very long.

07:25.042 --> 07:34.977
and kind of transferred from one group of planes to another, B-17s, B-24s, and B-25s.

07:35.217 --> 07:40.425
I only flew one mission in the B-26, and that was in France.

07:40.626 --> 07:41.667
First time you were shot down.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.872
I know that's an interesting story about where you hid.

07:45.493 --> 07:48.498
Talk a little bit about your hiding place and being shot down the first time.

07:49.419 --> 07:53.445
Well, we had bombed the...

07:53.695 --> 07:57.000
wall bearing factories at Schweinfurt.

07:57.020 --> 08:04.511
And we're coming back when we met a lot of fighters and messerschmitts that gave us a lot of trouble.

08:05.693 --> 08:12.002
And we had to crash land right on the border between Holland and Germany.

08:12.022 --> 08:20.074
And as we landed, we didn't really land, we belly landed.

08:20.628 --> 08:28.857
got out of the plane, and three of us ran towards the farmhouse, towards the farm barn, and the other three ran in some other direction.

08:28.997 --> 08:33.802
We had a few wounded people we left in the plane.

08:34.843 --> 08:41.229
And as we were running towards it, the farmer came running out and said, no, no, no, no, no.

08:42.371 --> 08:49.538
And he showed us the big pile of manure, and so we wondered what he was talking about.

08:49.518 --> 08:58.370
We ran over there and opened the door and there was a little hut sort of thing and there were three RAF people there.

08:58.410 --> 09:02.456
And so we slid in behind him and he closed the door.

09:02.476 --> 09:10.687
And it wasn't three, four minutes later that we could hear the Germans running around there looking for us on the thing.

09:11.268 --> 09:17.196
The three others that ran in an opposite direction from us were captured.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.474
So this was a cellar that was pretty much camouflaged by manure.

09:21.714 --> 09:22.255
That's right.

09:22.355 --> 09:22.636
Right.

09:22.936 --> 09:26.603
And so the Germans, they weren't interested in getting near that, obviously.

09:26.804 --> 09:29.569
And that evidently saved you.

09:30.029 --> 09:31.472
And you were able to escape from that, though.

09:31.756 --> 09:47.421
Then a little, the next morning, we stayed there overnight, and the next, towards morning of the night, a truck came along and we all got into the, into a truck that carried fish.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.369
And of course we were all down, got into the truck and covered up.

09:53.370 --> 09:59.620
And he took us to a place on the north, on the coastline of,

09:59.600 --> 10:08.510
of Holland, which I don't even know where it was, but it was a Catholic church that we got off, and we went down into the basement of the church.

10:10.012 --> 10:27.312
We stayed there the rest of the day, and then at night, we moved out towards the sea, got on a fish boat, and went out to the, somewhere out into the North Sea.

10:27.292 --> 10:41.649
Oh, after about four or five hours or longer, it seemed like days, but we heard the boat stop and they told us to come up, get out of the fish hole, which was pretty ripe by that time.

10:41.669 --> 10:42.810
Yes, I bet so.

10:42.930 --> 10:49.578
And then we were up on deck and pretty soon we saw a submarine come up right next to us.

10:49.678 --> 10:52.081
It was a British submarine that came in.

10:52.101 --> 10:57.147
We were taken off the boat, fish boat, got into the submarine.

10:57.127 --> 11:06.664
And the British filled the boat with fish and he left and went back to Holland and we were taken back to England.

11:07.437 --> 11:15.007
As a Pathfinder and Navigator, you generally, I guess, flew in the lead plane of most formations, and that made you a pretty easy target for the Germans.

11:15.027 --> 11:18.832
They figured if they could get that lead plane, they were going to mess things up quite a bit.

11:18.852 --> 11:19.493
That's right.

11:19.513 --> 11:30.508
And they could identify us pretty quickly because we had a big, gray tub underneath the plane that actually carried the radar equipment, I think.

11:30.640 --> 11:37.663
Talk about your mission specifically at D-Day and what your job was on June the 6th, 1944.

11:37.762 --> 11:46.214
Well, on D-Day, actually, we were told we were going to fly early.

11:47.336 --> 11:56.209
And General Eisenhower was at our field, and he talked to the paratroopers and said, good luck.

11:56.990 --> 12:01.997
And we all got into the plane at about 1 o'clock in the morning.

12:01.977 --> 12:15.993
and flew over to Cherbourg Peninsula and dropped the, and they, it was the 82nd Airborne that we dropped into, on the Cherbourg Peninsula.

12:17.074 --> 12:26.365
And then we flew back, and as soon as we landed, we were coupled with some

12:27.830 --> 12:35.427
gliders that carried a jeep and six men or six men and a howitzer.

12:35.447 --> 12:44.708
And we'd pull them over and they'd fly, well after a certain area, wherever the drop zone was,

12:45.312 --> 12:50.639
They cut off and landed hopefully well.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.762
A lot of them did not.

12:53.703 --> 12:57.148
And so we turned around and came back.

12:58.069 --> 13:03.396
And this went on for about two and a half days.

13:03.496 --> 13:05.599
And then we began to fly in ammunition.

13:06.625 --> 13:13.371
And these were dropped by parapacks right on the ground, right from the plane itself.

13:14.372 --> 13:18.095
And these were C-47s.

13:18.175 --> 13:18.976
It wasn't a bomber.

13:18.996 --> 13:20.798
It was C-47s.

13:20.878 --> 13:26.823
And that's like the old DC-3 that we know now.

13:27.884 --> 13:30.426
And flew medical supplies and everything.

13:31.327 --> 13:36.632
And after 10 days,

13:36.612 --> 13:40.099
began to land at cow pastures.

13:41.001 --> 13:49.457
Actually the engineers would line the field with steel mats and we'd land on there

13:49.927 --> 13:53.370
take the wounded, and come back to England.

13:54.171 --> 13:57.974
This went on for about, well, 15 days.

13:58.054 --> 14:09.524
And then we were, after I met Yolanda, we were then ordered to go to Italy to get ready for the invasion of southern France.

14:10.665 --> 14:19.933
And we were stationed at Civitavecchia, which was about 40 miles north of Rome.

14:19.913 --> 14:25.544
area there, that landing was a milk run compared to what we had in D-Day.

14:25.745 --> 14:26.887
I'll bet it was.

14:26.907 --> 14:34.783
The paratroopers landed, little or no opposition.

14:35.388 --> 14:37.973
Yolanda, you joined the Army North Corps in 1943.

14:38.273 --> 14:41.178
You decided you didn't want to be just a private nurse.

14:41.198 --> 14:46.087
You wanted to get involved, but somebody was determined that you weren't going to go overseas.

14:46.107 --> 14:52.518
They said you had bad eyesight and flat feet, but you told them that differently, and sure enough, you served overseas.

14:52.599 --> 14:54.021
Talk about how that all came about.

14:54.794 --> 14:59.440
Well, when I joined the Army, they told me that I would only be assigned to the United States.

15:00.481 --> 15:02.584
And I told the recruiter, I don't think so.

15:02.604 --> 15:03.605
But I said, we'll see.

15:04.526 --> 15:08.591
And I was assigned to Fletcher General Hospital in Cambridge, Ohio.

15:08.611 --> 15:14.980
And fortunately, at that time being, we were in blue uniforms and they were changing the khaki.

15:15.580 --> 15:19.145
And the Army said they would furnish me with all the things that I needed.

15:19.706 --> 15:22.489
But unfortunately, they didn't get to where I was.

15:22.469 --> 15:27.034
And I ran around in civilian clothes, which annoyed my chief nurse, no end.

15:27.855 --> 15:35.945
And as a result of that, she assigned me to the 100th evacuation hospital overseas.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.848
So I got overseas, which I wanted to be anyway.

15:39.288 --> 15:43.273
Talk about the 100th evacuation hospital, exactly what was its mission.

15:43.293 --> 15:47.778
You were near the front lines, I know, involved in D-Day and later.

15:48.339 --> 15:51.042
No, we landed.

15:51.595 --> 15:55.220
Our unit landed in France in July, just before they bombed St.

15:55.240 --> 15:55.701
Louis.

15:55.721 --> 15:56.883
I understand.

15:56.903 --> 16:02.451
And we were assembled in a field next to Reims, France.

16:03.692 --> 16:07.959
And that's where we got our first casualties.

16:07.979 --> 16:12.405
And these were ongoing things.

16:12.385 --> 16:18.860
When our hospital moved, we moved one half at a time so that we could keep going constantly.

16:19.381 --> 16:28.842
We would take one half of the hospital and move it forward to wherever we were assigned to and then the other half would come when they were already in place so that we never really

16:29.986 --> 16:38.418
had time to, well, to relax or anything else because we were constantly on the go getting these things set up.

16:38.438 --> 16:44.927
And an evacuation hospital is the first place they go after a first aid.

16:44.947 --> 16:46.409
I see, after first aid.

16:46.429 --> 16:55.642
Yeah, and what you do for triage, you put people back in combat before you take care of the seriously ill ones.

16:55.662 --> 16:59.908
And the ones that are very serious, you hopefully with

16:59.888 --> 17:04.172
IVs and so forth that you could keep them going until they could get into surgery.

17:04.893 --> 17:09.317
As a triage nurse this was rather overwhelming responsibility to make these decisions.

17:09.598 --> 17:09.998
It was.

17:10.358 --> 17:16.705
I mean another doctor and I made these decisions but we had to carry them out and it was very overwhelming.

17:16.745 --> 17:26.875
After doing it for about four or five months I asked to be transferred to a surgical ward and let somebody else take over that responsibility.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.115
Indeed.

17:29.135 --> 17:35.243
And for some 18 months, you pretty much followed Patton's army.

17:35.443 --> 17:36.244
Yes.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.228
Through different countries and eventually to Germany.

17:39.489 --> 17:47.520
Yeah, we were, I think the longest away from the armies was four or five miles, longest.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.161
Right.

17:48.761 --> 17:51.926
And when it came to the Battle of the Bulge, we were less than a mile.

17:53.568 --> 17:56.111
From where the Bulge was being fought.

17:56.512 --> 17:56.592
Yes.

17:57.112 --> 18:05.509
I think now might be a good time to go to some photographs that the Kozlowski's have kept throughout their time.

18:05.529 --> 18:09.798
And we've got about four or five photographs that I would like to go to now.

18:09.818 --> 18:15.811
And I believe that the first one, Mr. Kozlowski, I believe is, tell us what we're looking at there.

18:15.831 --> 18:16.993
I believe that's you on the left.

18:17.412 --> 18:22.076
Yes, well we were in the doorway of the C-47.

18:23.037 --> 18:35.990
This is the plane that we dropped the paratroopers with and brought the wounded back and carried all supplies and everything into the war zone.

18:36.010 --> 18:44.618
And I flew about 42 missions in the C-47 and 42 with the bombers.

18:45.408 --> 18:48.052
Okay, let's go on to the next photograph now.

18:48.072 --> 18:52.198
That's a souvenir of war, and that is you holding it.

18:52.218 --> 18:59.950
Well, I was holding a Nazi flag and a German helmet and so forth.

19:00.350 --> 19:08.863
And it's funny, I guess it isn't funny, but I called it a Nazi flag, and that is what the Germans call it now.

19:09.284 --> 19:12.208
They don't not call it the German flag.

19:13.589 --> 19:20.880
Let's move on to the next photograph, and I think this is, Yolanda, this is from your part of the war.

19:21.721 --> 19:33.079
This was treating a minor injury, but we did wherever we could, and most of the minor injuries we did as they came in, because all our supplies were there.

19:33.099 --> 19:36.424
You can't see them, but they were there, and we were taking care of the minor injury.

19:37.197 --> 20:05.533
right-hand picture the large picture that's you on the on the left yes of that with other medical personnel right and and uh and soldiers evidently that you were treating then yeah and then on the uh on the left are four nurses none of those are you but those are uh some of uh friends of mine some friends of yours outside of one of the tents that was there were where you lived yeah there were four nurses assigned to each tent and the four nurses that i lived with i'm the only one that's a survivor i see

20:06.475 --> 20:08.437
Move on to the next picture.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.239
This was the evacuation hospital.

20:10.379 --> 20:12.801
That's how they set it up, yes.

20:12.821 --> 20:17.706
It was not a small operation.

20:17.726 --> 20:27.015
An evacuation hospital was a large, like a station hospital in England, where there were a lot of people.

20:27.055 --> 20:30.278
We had radiology, we had dental work, we had surgery.

20:30.738 --> 20:32.820
I mean, a lot of things happened there.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.049
All under a tent.

20:35.069 --> 20:35.870
All under tents.

20:35.890 --> 20:36.631
All under tents.

20:38.134 --> 20:45.686
And the final picture is there you all are, those young Ed and Yolanda Kozlowski.

20:46.227 --> 20:53.458
And I guess those were just your formal military photographs, is that right?

20:53.478 --> 20:55.682
That's right, yeah.

20:55.702 --> 20:57.404
That's what we sent back home.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.027
Indeed.

20:59.598 --> 21:00.620
Yolanda, I want to talk to you.

21:00.640 --> 21:09.922
You said that there were times that you went on leave and you found your way in Paris, and you were able to meet some very interesting people when you were there, journalists who were covering the war.

21:09.962 --> 21:14.152
Just about every journalist that was in the European theater, you had the opportunity to meet.

21:14.212 --> 21:14.653
Is that right?

21:14.633 --> 21:16.216
That is right.

21:16.236 --> 21:23.510
That was because I met a Francis Chase, who was a journalist for the New Yorker.

21:24.833 --> 21:33.970
And with his introduction to all these journalists, it was a very good thing to meet all these people that were writing about the war.

21:34.872 --> 21:36.355
I didn't agree about that.

21:36.335 --> 21:47.667
I also met Ernest Hemingway through him, and he and Francis Chase had fought in the Spanish War together.

21:47.687 --> 21:51.851
And I do not have good memories of Hemingway.

21:52.592 --> 21:59.980
I thought he was very uncouth, and I think that he was only concerned with himself.

22:00.635 --> 22:02.318
So there you go.

22:02.378 --> 22:08.428
Mr. Chase gave you something and we're going to that shot right now, which allows me to hold this up.

22:08.449 --> 22:11.213
This is a silk map.

22:12.195 --> 22:13.077
You tell us about it.

22:13.157 --> 22:13.998
What is this?

22:14.018 --> 22:17.985
It's a silk map and where the blue line is drawn is where the

22:17.965 --> 22:20.328
United States forces were at that time.

22:20.348 --> 22:21.649
They weren't any further than that.

22:22.591 --> 22:27.897
So as you can see we were very close to the coastline and we had not gone in.

22:27.917 --> 22:42.435
There was still a lot of German fighting and this was given to people so that if they got lost they sort of could find their way because they had taken away all the signs of the towns that were around there.

22:42.455 --> 22:45.238
You went in through a town and you didn't know what town you were in.

22:45.742 --> 22:50.908
It's hard to tell on the television, but as I'm holding it, this is just like a silk scarf.

22:51.088 --> 22:53.190
It's made of the same material.

22:53.210 --> 22:58.677
And the reason they did this was so that if it got wet, it would dry it out.

22:58.757 --> 23:00.198
That's right.

23:00.479 --> 23:05.444
Cotton did not stand underneath the wear and tear, and that's the reason they did it.

23:05.464 --> 23:06.686
And these are very rare things.

23:06.706 --> 23:07.246
Yes, they are.

23:09.589 --> 23:09.949
Amazing.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.492
There weren't too many of them.

23:13.045 --> 23:17.436
There weren't too many, and there's still not many around, but you obviously treasure this one.

23:17.456 --> 23:18.198
Yes, I do.

23:18.218 --> 23:20.183
Right.

23:20.203 --> 23:27.561
Captain Kozlowski, after your service was over, there's so many much more to talk about, both your service, but we're limited in time.

23:27.895 --> 23:34.787
You were educated in Wisconsin at Marquette, at Ohio State University eventually.

23:34.807 --> 23:40.536
And eventually you became a part of NASA and quite an instrumental part of NASA.

23:40.597 --> 23:43.221
Talk about what you did for the Space Administration.

23:43.201 --> 23:49.129
Well, actually, I started to work for NASA at the Cleveland Wind Tunnel.

23:50.330 --> 23:59.943
And I had quite a bit of experience when I worked for a steel mill with the ceramics that were used in the furnaces and so forth.

24:00.003 --> 24:11.638
And so I talked about that a little bit, and suddenly I found myself working with ceramics for the heat shield on the bottom of the Apollo missions.

24:12.209 --> 24:33.559
of the Apollo vessels and my job was to try to design one that would withstand the temperatures coming back from the trips and that's what brought me to Texas.

24:33.539 --> 24:39.049
The Apollo's did not have any problem with the heat shield itself.

24:39.710 --> 24:46.041
The previous vessel, the Mercury's, did almost burn through twice.

24:46.061 --> 24:49.928
So that's why they're particularly interested in that.

24:49.908 --> 25:05.412
Now, in Apollo 13, I was in the control room when Lebel got on the radio and he radioed back.

25:05.532 --> 25:08.076
He says, Houston, we have a problem.

25:09.058 --> 25:15.268
But the way he said it and the sound of his voice, everybody knew it was something more than a little problem.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.451
It kind of galvanized the whole...

25:17.431 --> 25:22.561
whole area, whole control room into action.

25:23.543 --> 25:29.034
And the movie represented it very well.

25:29.616 --> 25:35.828
There was no bi-play in there at all that I could see, that I could remember.

25:35.808 --> 25:37.270
They didn't Hollywood it up a lot.

25:37.390 --> 25:38.631
It was pretty much true to form.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.314
It was pretty straightforward kind of thing.

25:41.334 --> 25:41.794
Indeed.

25:41.814 --> 25:59.813
And it's very difficult to imagine you had as many as six men, well, four in the lamb, as they called it, the vessel that was supposed to land on the moon.

26:00.314 --> 26:04.178
And it didn't...

26:04.158 --> 26:07.144
Well, they were very, very crowded.

26:07.164 --> 26:11.232
One of them, of course, was sick, was a little ill.

26:11.392 --> 26:18.466
And when they finally got back, it was a joy to us and joy to them, I'm sure.

26:19.328 --> 26:19.548
All right.

26:19.568 --> 26:26.081
Y'all have been married for 58 years now, so obviously this is an event in his professional life that you remember very well also.

26:26.181 --> 26:26.622
Oh, yes.

26:26.602 --> 26:32.433
It was a stressful time, but a successful time at the same time.

26:32.713 --> 26:43.733
And I'm going to put a little bit in here that my husband also devised a system where they could retrieve bullets that were fired from guns.

26:43.713 --> 26:51.261
He suggested that they fire them into water, and if they fired them into water, the shells fell down into a canister.

26:51.281 --> 26:53.564
Well, this is when I worked for a company called TRW.

26:54.945 --> 27:01.833
And one of their products was to make the M1 rifle.

27:01.853 --> 27:06.017
And the problem was, how do you test them?

27:06.558 --> 27:12.184
And they made millions of these, and of course, the amount of lead they used was tremendous.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.426
Pretty amazing.

27:13.446 --> 27:18.552
And so what we did, we had them shoot into a tank of water.

27:18.572 --> 27:28.324
And the opening in the tank was on the side, and not on the top and then the side, and the water would be flying.

27:28.344 --> 27:31.148
It's a fascinating story, but I'm sorry that we're out of time.

27:31.168 --> 27:32.009
And I apologize.

27:32.069 --> 27:33.291
Thank you very much for being here.

27:33.331 --> 27:34.192
It's an amazing story.

27:34.472 --> 27:38.357
They served in different European arenas, but somehow knew that they would get together.

27:38.337 --> 27:42.909
and we thank the Kozlowskis for their service, as we thank all veterans.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.734
Please join us next time.

27:44.754 --> 27:48.564
I'm Tom Turbiville, and this is Veterans of the Valley.

27:48.584 --> 27:59.873
We thank you.
