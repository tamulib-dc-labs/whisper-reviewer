00:27.419 --> 00:29.581
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.601 --> 00:31.523
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.543 --> 00:36.748
It's hard to imagine that anyone has packed more living into 80 years than Don Nicholas O'Brien.

00:37.229 --> 00:47.399
A&M class of 1948, A&M quarterback in 1947, 48 and 49, played football and baseball in the service before the Korean War heated up.

00:47.419 --> 00:52.144
Once it did, he flew 20 B-29 missions from his base in Okinawa.

00:52.124 --> 01:00.079
What was going to be a single hitch in the Air Force, followed by a coaching career, turned out instead to be a 31-year career as a flyer.

01:00.099 --> 01:04.127
That included three tours of Vietnam, flying 69 B-52 missions.

01:04.568 --> 01:15.128
And then after he retired in 1976, Don Nicholas and his Air Force buddy, Ken Lighty, spent 15 years as one of the top senior tennis doubles teams in the country.

01:15.108 --> 01:19.553
It has been quite a life, and we are proud to welcome Colonel Don Nicholas to Veterans of the Valley.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.574
What a life it's been.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.196
I want to talk about the football.

01:22.216 --> 01:28.564
I want to talk about Texas A&M before you went off to Korea, but I want to get into that right now.

01:28.764 --> 01:41.439
After college, you finished at A&M in 1950, and after college, you thought about being a coach, but in the meantime, you were going to do a 90-day hitch, but that turned into a 31-year career.

01:41.519 --> 01:44.322
Sort of talk about after college and getting into the service.

01:45.162 --> 01:57.957
Of course, I graduated at mid-year in 1950 and was ready to pursue a coaching career.

01:59.287 --> 02:15.689
I had a little block of time before the football started the following year, and so I decided to accept a 90-day tour of active duty and kind of try my commission out up at Hensley Field in Dallas.

02:15.929 --> 02:22.358
And so it was up there that I took the examinations over at the Naval.

02:22.338 --> 02:42.296
air facility there and passed them and was notified later on that I had passed and that I would be called up to active duty or given the chance to be called up to active duty for the flying program in probably six months or so.

02:42.917 --> 02:49.763
So that sounded good to me and I'd always wanted to fly so I jumped at it and here I am.

02:49.844 --> 02:54.449
And you ended up, you were flying in Korea, you flew B-29s in Korea.

02:54.569 --> 02:55.490
B-29, yes.

02:56.011 --> 02:57.172
That's quite an airplane.

02:57.272 --> 02:59.775
What was it like to fly that much metal?

03:00.296 --> 03:10.107
Well, one of the things about it, it's an 11-man crew to begin with, and all of the positions inside that airplane.

03:10.587 --> 03:15.312
Kind of a small airplane for 11 people to get into and work.

03:15.332 --> 03:15.473
Right.

03:15.873 --> 03:19.497
But we had a great crew.

03:19.477 --> 03:22.141
Finished flying school at Lubbock in 1951.

03:22.462 --> 03:31.455
I was sent to San Antonio Randolph Field for transition training into B-29s.

03:31.636 --> 03:39.207
And it was there that I was crewed up with people who were fed into the system by the personnel folks.

03:39.187 --> 03:46.758
And we had a lot of retreads down there, old World War II types that had been recalled to active duty.

03:47.600 --> 04:02.983
And I was lucky to get on with Lou Andrews, an old, experienced B-17 pilot, along with a navigator and a bombardier.

04:02.963 --> 04:05.606
I believe it was a radar operator.

04:06.727 --> 04:12.474
We all crewed up and then we had some young'uns manning the gunning positions.

04:12.494 --> 04:14.496
So we went through training together.

04:16.578 --> 04:21.924
Finishing school for us out after Randolph was Lake Charles.

04:22.545 --> 04:31.215
Went out there and all went to survival school and finished up our work and were immediately reassigned to the 19th Bomb Group.

04:31.195 --> 04:32.177
out at Okinawa.

04:32.978 --> 04:36.765
And so that's the way it all got started.

04:36.785 --> 04:41.213
Don, the Korean War sometimes is called the Forgotten War by a lot of people, a lot of historians.

04:41.233 --> 04:44.299
Obviously not forgotten by you or a lot of historians.

04:44.840 --> 04:51.311
Talk about your experience in the Korean War, 20 bombing missions, 20 missions into North Korea or into Korea.

04:51.632 --> 04:53.355
Sort of talk about your experience there.

04:53.572 --> 05:01.700
Well, the tours out there were generally six months long, and they were rotating crews in there pretty regularly.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.945
So I think my crew flew about 25 missions.

05:05.965 --> 05:23.022
I flew 20 because generally when the new crews came in, they bumped the co-pilot and took the new pilot along with the old head and gave him a couple of rides along with the navigator.

05:23.002 --> 05:45.280
the two key guys on the crew and so I got bumped a couple of times and so I didn't quite catch up with my crew but nevertheless the flying was generally interdictory type in other words we were up after troop concentrations

05:45.260 --> 05:48.507
marshaling yards.

05:48.527 --> 05:58.969
Whenever some kind of a skirmish broke out and they needed some air support, we were called in up there to help out with that.

05:58.989 --> 06:04.680
But we were in good shape all along.

06:04.741 --> 06:06.424
Our fighter guys kept the

06:07.805 --> 06:10.851
The MiGs off of us, for the most part.

06:11.172 --> 06:13.396
There were times when they did get through.

06:14.859 --> 06:21.191
And we lost a couple of airplanes out of my outfit early on, and I remember it very well.

06:21.231 --> 06:22.714
It was on June the 10th.

06:24.979 --> 06:29.307
I was not flying that night, but one of our crews was flying, and they were shot down.

06:29.287 --> 06:35.976
coming off a target, I believe, by MiGs who were up in the area.

06:35.996 --> 06:43.606
Now, they had sanctuary over in Manchuria, over in a place called Antongue, and they came out pretty often.

06:43.626 --> 06:49.995
But our fighter guys, again, kept them pretty well suppressed, but every once in a while, you know, they'd get loose.

06:49.975 --> 06:54.142
You did get shot at at one point, though, and lost an engine, right?

06:54.162 --> 06:56.165
That was kind of a dicey deal, I guess.

06:56.185 --> 07:02.394
Yes, it was, and I remember that was my first experience having something like that happen, and it happened at night.

07:03.236 --> 07:07.883
Now, most of our missions were at night because of the

07:07.863 --> 07:10.265
A daytime problem with the MiGs.

07:11.787 --> 07:24.578
They were beginning to get pretty close to our airplanes up there, so they finally changed us to night missions pretty much exclusively.

07:24.598 --> 07:37.330
And so we would be up there and listen to all the calls coming from the radar sites and others who track the fighters.

07:37.310 --> 07:44.802
And this particular night we were up doing some work around the hydroelectric plants on the Yalu River.

07:45.904 --> 07:57.242
And the flak going in was pretty heavy because the way that we were bombing, we were bombing single ship.

07:57.222 --> 08:05.736
would be stacked up mile separation and 500 feet back for the cell and proceed that way.

08:05.796 --> 08:11.785
But all the radar searchlights would pick up the lead airplane coming through because they knew where he was headed.

08:11.846 --> 08:12.787
He was headed for the dam.

08:13.729 --> 08:18.336
And they'd start all of their shooting up there.

08:18.316 --> 08:31.297
And I heard something that sounded like just a handful of rocks thrown against the fuselage.

08:31.317 --> 08:39.291
And we began to lose oil pressure on one of the engines and the engineer who was monitoring that said we better shut this down.

08:39.331 --> 08:41.995
I think we're going to maybe have a fire or something.

08:41.975 --> 08:46.400
Before he could get it shut down, it caught fire.

08:46.420 --> 08:52.446
And it makes a pretty big light at night when you have an engine fire.

08:52.466 --> 08:58.974
And so we finally nosed it over and picked up a little speed and just kind of helped it go out.

08:59.034 --> 09:00.635
We actually blew it out.

09:01.476 --> 09:02.277
And it stopped.

09:02.377 --> 09:10.446
And after that particular mission, we had to go down to southern Japan in Itazuki and land and get the airplane fixed.

09:10.426 --> 09:23.346
And when I got outside and looked at the condition of the fuselage and the engine, it looked like a big can opener had gone through and made little holes in an airplane.

09:23.426 --> 09:29.576
But fortunately it didn't hit any important hydraulic system, electrics or anything like that.

09:30.077 --> 09:32.721
So we were able to get it fixed and get on back.

09:32.701 --> 09:34.563
I know you count yourself as very fortunate.

09:34.603 --> 09:40.971
Between Korea and Vietnam, you described your duties in the Air Force as being in a constant state of readiness.

09:41.432 --> 09:44.135
We're talking about the Cold War, always being ready.

09:44.155 --> 09:49.241
And you talked about your B-52 missions from Bergstrom to the East Coast to Alaska.

09:50.042 --> 09:54.227
This was just to always keep a check on the Russians, essentially.

09:54.247 --> 09:55.148
That's pretty much...

09:55.128 --> 09:57.891
how you spent your time between Korea and Vietnam, is that right?

09:58.131 --> 09:59.493
Yes.

09:59.513 --> 10:07.762
I was in the Strategic Air Command, and of course they were kind of carrying the ball for our face-off with the Soviets with regard to the nuclear war.

10:08.543 --> 10:24.882
And part of that scheme was a constant alert that went on for years, and that duty was given to various units from time to time on a regular basis.

10:24.862 --> 10:33.535
And we would, like you say, take off from Bergstrom out to the East Coast, refuel, and take on a big load of gas and get on over toward Alaska.

10:33.775 --> 10:40.866
And we had a place over there where we orbited to make sure that the Soviets, and they could see us on their radars.

10:40.886 --> 10:45.332
And they knew when I left that a guy was going to be in behind me and he'll come up there.

10:45.372 --> 10:49.919
And so that position was manned for 24 hours a day and for years.

10:49.939 --> 10:50.059
Right.

10:50.039 --> 10:55.285
But that mission would last anywhere from 22 to 24 hours.

10:55.305 --> 11:05.516
And we would, when we'd leave our position there around Alaska, come on down to Seattle and then kind of angle back over toward Bergstrom.

11:05.596 --> 11:11.643
And that would kind of wear you out after a while.

11:11.683 --> 11:16.789
But we were able to spread it out amongst the squadron people, and so it was bearable.

11:16.988 --> 11:21.356
It's tough to move through 31 years in the limited time that we have, but I want to move on to Vietnam.

11:21.376 --> 11:31.453
You did do three tours of Vietnam, flying V-52s, missions of, I think you said 69 missions in your service in Vietnam, missions that would go from 8 to 10 hours each.

11:31.653 --> 11:37.081
sort of wrap up your service in Vietnam and what your job was?

11:38.543 --> 11:39.664
Well, I went out there first.

11:39.925 --> 11:49.999
In 1966, I went out as just a line pilot, and so I was flying a crew, and we were flying every third day, eight to 10 hours, like you say.

11:51.481 --> 12:01.141
And then my second tour out there, I got a squadron, and so I did a fair amount of flying with my people.

12:01.161 --> 12:10.941
I had about 15 crews out there in that squadron, so I would fly with them on a regular basis.

12:10.921 --> 12:18.030
And then the third tour out there in 1972, there was a pretty good break between 67 and 72.

12:19.192 --> 12:26.461
I was the vice-wing commander of a unit in Plattsburgh, New York, and we were flying FB-111s up there.

12:26.481 --> 12:39.257
But I guess the people who were manning the jobs out there saw my B-52 experience and decided that I would be somebody they could use out there.

12:39.237 --> 12:45.022
And at that time, they were building up the force for eventually going north.

12:45.983 --> 12:55.552
And so I was the director of operations for the Air Division, and we had about two tactical wings out there about that time.

12:56.193 --> 13:06.342
And then the incumbent of the vice commander job was moved into another job, and so I got the vice commander job.

13:06.322 --> 13:11.389
But we were flying from that particular job.

13:11.449 --> 13:16.636
We were doing airborne commander work, more supervisory stuff.

13:16.716 --> 13:25.307
If we had maybe six airplanes going out or three airplanes going out, they needed an airborne commander for the flight.

13:25.327 --> 13:29.292
And so we were flying in that capacity for the most part.

13:29.512 --> 13:29.933
Right.

13:29.913 --> 13:40.992
And you did encounter, there was ground-to-air missiles aiming to get at you, but you were pretty well protected on that, and you could pretty much see them coming, right?

13:41.012 --> 13:42.836
We could see ground flash at night.

13:43.677 --> 13:49.407
Normally we would pick up, our equipment was...

13:49.387 --> 13:55.719
such that we could hear a radar sweep on our airplane if somebody had interest in us.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.963
You could hear this sweep coming by.

13:58.784 --> 14:06.619
And when that sound became a little more rapid, you knew they were trying to lock onto you.

14:06.599 --> 14:16.489
And once they got a, you heard a little something like a bee buzzing in there, that meant a missile was imminent.

14:16.529 --> 14:18.891
I mean, probably going to be launched.

14:18.911 --> 14:22.434
Now, we'll say this about our wild weasel guys.

14:22.855 --> 14:31.744
If those guys came up on the air and stayed on, stayed locked on more than about five seconds, the wild weasels were down there and they were looking for them.

14:31.764 --> 14:36.268
And they had some missiles they could launch and put right in the middle of that

14:36.248 --> 14:37.870
They threw like a treetop level, right?

14:37.990 --> 14:39.572
Yeah, yeah.

14:40.854 --> 14:45.020
They would just lob those Shrike missiles over into that battery.

14:45.881 --> 14:50.287
So we just called it Kentucky windage.

14:50.727 --> 14:57.236
They would come up just long enough to get a little bit of a track on you and a lock, and they would fire stuff.

14:57.537 --> 15:05.327
But it was not very precise, and so they didn't get many of us that way.

15:05.307 --> 15:13.414
Don, you had a wonderful military career, and I wish we could do a whole show just on your military career, but there's a whole different aspect of your career, and that's Don Nicholas, the athlete.

15:14.015 --> 15:16.297
And we referred to it a little bit in the opening.

15:16.317 --> 15:20.641
Don, you were a football player, you were a baseball player.

15:20.881 --> 15:26.866
In your retirement years, you were a tennis player on the tennis circuit.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.548
We're gonna go to some photographs in a minute.

15:29.229 --> 15:34.133
We're gonna see a lot of pictures of Don Nicholas, the A&M quarterback in the late 40s, as a matter of fact.

15:34.113 --> 15:36.838
As a matter of fact, let's go to those pictures now, and we can look at it.

15:36.878 --> 15:40.144
We can talk a little bit about it right now, the photographs of you, and here we are.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.890
First off, this is your senior photo at Texas A&M.

15:42.910 --> 15:45.254
That is one fine-looking senior right there.

15:45.935 --> 15:47.899
So that was taken, I guess, what, in 1949 or so?

15:47.939 --> 15:49.762
1948, really.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.504
1948, yeah.

15:50.544 --> 15:54.872
And that was taken up at the North Gate, and we had a guy up there that...

15:54.852 --> 15:56.936
I think he took all the senior pictures.

15:57.016 --> 15:57.597
Yeah, yeah.

15:58.119 --> 15:59.161
That's a great picture.

15:59.181 --> 15:59.702
Great picture.

16:00.183 --> 16:06.115
Okay, this is the, if I'm getting this right, I think the viewers can see it up at the top.

16:06.155 --> 16:14.852
This is the team with Homer Norton was the head coach, and the coaches are in the top row, and their heads may be a little cut off, but...

16:14.832 --> 16:24.392
As a matter of fact, if we want the viewers to see you the way I've identified it, if you look in the third row towards the left side, see number 37 right there.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.556
You're the guy right behind number 37.

16:27.258 --> 16:28.560
I think that's what we discovered.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.141
Is that you?

16:29.562 --> 16:33.330
So that would be the team of what, 1947, I believe?

16:33.361 --> 16:36.126
That's 40, let's see.

16:36.427 --> 16:41.155
If Homer Norton was there, I believe he was there one year, your first year back in 1947.

16:41.416 --> 16:43.219
And that was Homer Norton's team.

16:43.239 --> 16:44.160
So that would be the 47 team.

16:44.181 --> 16:51.213
Barney Welch down there on the front, second from the, to the left, old 79 there.

16:51.474 --> 16:51.594
Okay.

16:51.634 --> 16:54.319
Yeah, there's Barney.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.765
Barney hasn't changed much.

16:57.745 --> 17:00.549
And, gosh, yeah, that was a great bunch of guys.

17:00.629 --> 17:01.170
Right.

17:01.190 --> 17:03.974
Now we're going to move to the 1949 team.

17:04.034 --> 17:11.565
Harry Steitler was the head coach, and I believe Coach Steitler is there on the second row, the white-haired gentleman, sort of second from the right.

17:11.585 --> 17:14.870
I believe that's Coach Steitler, if I'm right.

17:15.291 --> 17:21.379
You're in the very front, number 16, and talk about this picture, because even though you're in the picture, you weren't really a member of the team.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.162
Talk about how that picture came about.

17:23.345 --> 17:30.659
Well, I had good friends who played on this team and were holdovers from last year.

17:31.441 --> 17:35.168
And I was at Hensley doing my 90-day tour of active duty.

17:35.188 --> 17:41.640
And so we got together, and they said, come on down here, and we'll have some fun.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.526
You watch the spring game.

17:44.810 --> 17:47.173
we'll be able to commiserate a little bit.

17:47.373 --> 17:54.883
So I came down and went in to see Mr. Steitler and had my uniform on.

17:54.923 --> 17:56.566
And he says, hi, Nick, how you doing?

17:56.586 --> 17:57.507
Good to see you.

17:57.527 --> 17:58.188
Good to see you.

17:58.909 --> 18:05.718
And he said, are you going to be down here a little while?

18:05.758 --> 18:06.499
And I said, yeah.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.161
I came down to watch the spring game.

18:08.181 --> 18:09.703
He said, you know, we didn't take a

18:09.683 --> 18:14.429
picture of the squad last year, and so I'd like to have you in this picture.

18:15.690 --> 18:19.815
He said, go in and have Sarge fit you up with the uniform and come join us.

18:21.156 --> 18:22.578
I need to correct myself.

18:22.598 --> 18:24.380
This is the 1950 team.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.582
You finished in 1949.

18:25.642 --> 18:32.169
This was the 1950 team, and he invited you to come and sit in the front row with the picture even though you'd already finished.

18:32.189 --> 18:32.830
Well, that's great.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.011
So you've got your team picture.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.113
That's great.

18:35.133 --> 18:35.753
Let's move on.

18:35.773 --> 18:36.394
I think we've got it.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.897
There's an action picture of

18:38.877 --> 18:41.621
The split tee quarterback, Don Nicholas, right there.

18:41.641 --> 18:43.444
You're carrying the football.

18:43.464 --> 18:44.906
See old Kyle Field in the background.

18:44.986 --> 18:47.611
That's what it used to look like.

18:50.455 --> 18:50.936
There you go.

18:51.617 --> 18:58.568
Talk about you're on the left, and a good member of the Brazos Valley there is in the middle and right.

18:58.608 --> 19:00.731
Talk about who those people are.

19:00.751 --> 19:06.099
Well, that's Jimmy Cashin in the middle there, and Burl Beatty on the right.

19:06.239 --> 19:07.281
Right, you're on the left, yeah.

19:07.345 --> 19:14.073
Burrell was an all-stater from Paris, Texas.

19:14.113 --> 19:18.158
Jimmy, of course, played his football locally here at Consolidated.

19:18.299 --> 19:25.227
His brother is Red Cashin, who everybody knows, the football official, and lived here for a long time.

19:26.269 --> 19:27.430
Burrell became a coach.

19:27.528 --> 19:28.369
Right?

19:28.389 --> 19:37.637
There's that good old action shot that you see a lot of, I guess I've got to say, maybe they still take those pictures of the football players, the action shot, so that they'll all have one.

19:38.498 --> 19:43.542
But you see a lot of guys have their own ideas about, you know, those shots.

19:43.602 --> 19:50.369
But the guy just kind of lines you up and says, come by and just make a turn and, you know, look kind of determined when you do that.

19:50.509 --> 19:50.889
Look mean.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.091
Look like you really do play without a helmet.

19:53.391 --> 19:54.833
Yeah.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.774
Okay.

19:56.954 --> 19:57.535
Let's move on.

19:57.515 --> 20:00.892
There's a shot of you.

20:00.912 --> 20:02.741
This is after you'd finished at Texas A&M.

20:02.762 --> 20:05.837
This was actually when you, I guess, early in your military career, right?

20:05.969 --> 20:06.430
It was.

20:06.550 --> 20:12.280
I had just graduated from flying school and was on my way, I thought, to the top rung.

20:12.981 --> 20:18.711
And my mother said, now, go have your picture taken.

20:18.732 --> 20:22.979
And so I got all my stuff together and went down and had a picture taken.

20:23.039 --> 20:24.221
I bet Mom loved that picture.

20:24.261 --> 20:24.842
Yes, she really did.

20:24.862 --> 20:25.564
That's a great picture.

20:26.125 --> 20:26.605
Nice teeth.

20:27.387 --> 20:27.968
Yeah, okay.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.913
Now, talk about this picture.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.363
This is our flight crew.

20:32.463 --> 20:35.570
That's Lou Andrews on the left there.

20:35.590 --> 20:42.244
He was an old automobile dealer in Lansing, Michigan, when he was recalled to active duty.

20:43.447 --> 20:50.202
The guy down there on my left is a recallee, and the guy on the right is a recallee.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.304
You're bottom row second from the left, by the way.

20:52.324 --> 20:53.546
Bottom row second from the left.

20:53.586 --> 20:53.826
Right.

20:54.147 --> 20:58.712
And the rest of those kids are just youngsters, except for that engineer.

20:58.772 --> 20:59.993
He's kind of up in the middle.

21:00.254 --> 21:00.494
Right.

21:00.554 --> 21:05.700
But I see there's still five of us that get together every year.

21:05.800 --> 21:15.031
We still see one another and have a big time talking about all that.

21:15.051 --> 21:16.172
That was our airplane.

21:16.253 --> 21:16.554
Yeah.

21:17.677 --> 21:28.102
Now this is, we're going to fast forward a few years, as a matter of fact, as you can see written on this picture, the National Senior Indoor Finals, taken in 1986 in Seattle, Washington.

21:28.122 --> 21:32.052
This is a, you're the second from the left, I guess on the left, is that your partner?

21:32.268 --> 21:33.831
Yes, that's Ken Lighty on the left.

21:33.911 --> 21:35.654
An old Air Force buddy.

21:36.014 --> 21:38.558
And of the other two, is that the other two that you played?

21:38.639 --> 21:41.744
And they were real tennis players.

21:41.804 --> 21:43.186
Now, Ken and I just took it up.

21:44.068 --> 21:58.191
He was a good tennis player, but I had played tennis before, and we just kept playing until we got better and finally ended up in the finals of this tennis tournament up in Seattle.

21:58.171 --> 22:01.839
And the two fellows on the right, I guess those were the ones that eeked a victory.

22:01.859 --> 22:05.767
Yeah, that's an Australian there on the right, and he's a heck of a tennis player.

22:06.469 --> 22:13.403
And the other guy is a surgeon and also a very fine amateur tennis player.

22:13.604 --> 22:15.568
Right.

22:15.588 --> 22:19.015
But we had a great time up there and just enjoyed it.

22:19.619 --> 22:22.483
I want to talk more about your athletic career.

22:22.523 --> 22:27.610
Let's go back now, as a matter of fact, because you played actually, you started at A&M in 1944.

22:27.670 --> 22:32.256
You played in 1944, but then you went off to the service.

22:32.937 --> 22:38.725
And when you went off to the service, sort of a downtime, little mop up from World War II,

22:38.705 --> 22:43.651
but you played football and baseball in the service for service teams in Honda.

22:44.192 --> 22:44.712
Talk about that.

22:44.732 --> 22:49.558
I don't think a lot of people are aware about athletics in service.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.763
It came about when the war ended.

22:55.205 --> 23:08.121
I was a young enlisted guy, and after basic training at Amarillo, their tech training school was there, the airplane and engines course, and so I was assigned to school.

23:08.101 --> 23:15.872
and I was well on my way to going to the Pacific as a B-29 crew chief whenever the war was over.

23:16.273 --> 23:20.339
And I remember it exactly.

23:20.359 --> 23:27.048
Somebody ran in and said the war was over about August the 15th, I believe, in 1950, 1945.

23:27.068 --> 23:32.656
1945, I'm getting my years mixed up.

23:33.557 --> 23:37.483
And so from that time on,

23:37.463 --> 23:49.944
The guys who had accumulated enough points and they adjusted those for this sudden happening so that people were beginning to get out and go home.

23:51.326 --> 24:01.463
I was a new fellow on the block, so to speak, because I had just finished up my basic training, and so I still had some time to do before I could go home.

24:01.443 --> 24:17.308
The physical training officer on the base there put out a call for a football team, and I had played some, so I went up there and applied, and he said, glad to have you.

24:17.288 --> 24:27.188
And we'll make you one of our physical training instructors, and then you can play football here and instruct in the physical training program, which suited me fine.

24:27.268 --> 24:28.911
I mean, that was right down my alley.

24:29.352 --> 24:30.735
So we played.

24:31.436 --> 24:35.184
We were the Amarillo Sky Giants, and we had a great football team.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.250
A lot of folks turned out to play.

24:38.230 --> 24:46.098
And we played people like the Hereford Prison Guards and we played the Dalhart Dominators.

24:46.859 --> 24:56.069
We played the Houston, it was Ellington Field, the old Ellington Field, Houston, I forget what their name was.

24:57.030 --> 25:05.098
And after about halfway through the season, we were beginning to run out of football players because everybody was getting out and leaving.

25:05.078 --> 25:15.384
So, the commander at Hondo Army Air Field had a team down there and he thought maybe some of us would like to come down and play.

25:16.266 --> 25:21.940
So he came up and bargained with our guy and he said, yeah, take them on down there and let them play.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.684
So we went to Hondo and played down there.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.405
And you played there.

25:25.665 --> 25:27.788
Don, we just got a couple of minutes left, but I want to move on.

25:27.808 --> 25:29.851
You eventually played baseball in the service also.

25:30.492 --> 25:32.014
And you played in Enid.

25:32.034 --> 25:33.096
You played in Oklahoma.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.658
You played against a lot of folks.

25:34.678 --> 25:42.128
When you came back and played football at Texas A&M, wins were a little bit scarce for Texas A&M in those three years of 47 through 49.

25:42.168 --> 25:45.132
But you played with people like Marion Pugh and Bob Smith.

25:45.193 --> 25:46.635
And we saw Barney Welch.

25:46.655 --> 25:50.560
You played against people like Doak Walker and Bobby Lane and...

25:50.540 --> 25:55.630
Tom Landry, I believe that you said, who played for the University of Texas, Daryl Royal.

25:55.650 --> 26:01.461
So there were a lot of famous people that played around that time that you were quarterback in A&M.

26:01.481 --> 26:08.835
Well, as you look back on it, it seems to...

26:08.815 --> 26:13.961
take on a little more significance because at that time they were just football players like everybody else.

26:14.241 --> 26:29.558
We were talking the other day about our friend Charlie Wright that caught the pass that was tipped by Bubba Shands and he happened to be running behind Bubba and was one of the few moral victories that we had.

26:29.578 --> 26:32.882
I think we tied Texas 14 all that day.

26:32.862 --> 26:39.078
It was a great career, and I don't want to leave without mentioning your wife, Mary, that you've been married nearly 55 years now.

26:39.098 --> 26:46.216
You have four children, three sons that all graduated from A&M and were Marines, and a daughter, Jackie, and I believe seven grandkids and a great-grandchild, right?

26:46.296 --> 26:46.677
Right.

26:46.798 --> 26:48.542
Right, and you're very, very proud of all of those.

26:48.522 --> 26:49.343
Absolutely.

26:49.444 --> 26:49.984
Absolutely.

26:50.004 --> 26:52.529
And we're very proud of you, and thank you for your service, and what a great life.

26:52.769 --> 26:53.290
Thank you.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.073
It's still going strong with great health.

26:55.093 --> 26:56.115
It's been a pleasure.

26:56.415 --> 27:06.292
Don Nicholas continues what has certainly been a life well spent, wherever he did, whatever he did, whether on the football field, the baseball diamond, the tennis court, or in the cockpit.

27:06.312 --> 27:08.936
He did it with passion, and we thank him for his service.

27:08.956 --> 27:13.804
We thank all veterans, and we invite you to join us again next time on Veterans of the Valley.
