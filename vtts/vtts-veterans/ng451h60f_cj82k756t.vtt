00:09.008 --> 00:26.781
Thank you.

00:31.013 --> 00:32.597
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.957 --> 00:34.701
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:34.721 --> 00:43.461
From the summer of 1987 to the summer of 1996, Major General Thomas G. Darling served as the Commandant of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets.

00:43.481 --> 00:47.149
But his years of service to our country started long before that.

00:47.129 --> 00:49.231
33 years before, to be exact.

00:49.752 --> 00:56.941
Aggie class of 1954, two months after graduation, active duty Air Force learned to fly, and boy did he fly.

00:57.401 --> 01:05.370
More than 7,000 hours, 500 of those piloting the giant B-52 on some 46 combat missions in Vietnam.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.613
His story would take weeks to tell.

01:07.633 --> 01:11.558
We'll do the best we can over the next two episodes of Veterans of the Valley.

01:11.918 --> 01:14.701
General Darling, it's a pleasure to have you here on Veterans of the Valley.

01:14.761 --> 01:15.542
Thank you very much.

01:15.582 --> 01:16.123
Let's sort of

01:16.610 --> 01:17.031
Pick it up.

01:17.091 --> 01:20.234
You were born in 1932 in Abilene, and that's where you grew up.

01:20.255 --> 01:25.541
Your mom and dad never went to college, but they were intent that you were going to be an Aggie and go to Texas A&M, right?

01:25.561 --> 01:26.462
Yes, that's right.

01:26.923 --> 01:42.482
My dad followed Texas A&M and the Experiment Station Extension Service news bulletins helping run the dairy farm, and he put it in my mind early on that I should go to college, that he didn't have that opportunity, but he wanted me to have it.

01:42.952 --> 01:46.918
So from about the fifth grade on, I was coming to Texas A&M.

01:46.938 --> 01:47.699
And indeed you did.

01:47.959 --> 01:48.961
You were a high school.

01:48.981 --> 01:51.605
You were a basketball star.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.449
Well, they fancied you a star.

01:54.589 --> 01:57.634
You came to A&M actually with the intent of playing some basketball, right?

01:57.654 --> 01:58.255
That's right.

01:58.395 --> 02:02.982
I'd played on the Abilene High School team for two years.

02:03.002 --> 02:04.524
And we had a good team.

02:04.544 --> 02:06.026
We didn't quite make it to state.

02:06.126 --> 02:12.115
But one of the A&M coaches had watched me one time and invited me to come down and

02:12.635 --> 02:23.046
I did, and he agreed that I would be in the athletic dorm and have a chance to make the Aggie team without a scholarship, so I did come under that circumstance.

02:23.066 --> 02:24.408
Right, and you played two years?

02:24.568 --> 02:25.449
I played two years.

02:25.589 --> 02:29.073
That 50-51 team, they're sort of in the history book, aren't they?

02:29.213 --> 02:29.834
Well, they are.

02:29.914 --> 02:33.778
I think the first one under the NCAA to make playoffs.

02:33.938 --> 02:34.619
Right.

02:34.639 --> 02:41.967
And we had an outstanding team that year, a new coach, and not much was expected, but we did have two or three really great players.

02:42.470 --> 02:47.779
Buddy Davis, who later won the high jump in the Olympics, was our center.

02:48.260 --> 02:51.064
He played professional ball for several years.

02:51.084 --> 02:56.634
And then a guard that I had to guard in practice, Jewel McDowell, was one of the toughest guys I've ever known.

02:57.215 --> 03:01.402
He could shoot a two-handed set shot.

03:01.422 --> 03:04.086
They don't do that anymore, but he was a master at it.

03:04.848 --> 03:07.532
But around some good guys that I played with and

03:08.052 --> 03:09.594
I still count them as friends.

03:09.874 --> 03:15.261
As a matter of fact, we're going to have a photograph, as a matter of fact, a little later on of that 50-51 team with you in the picture.

03:15.982 --> 03:24.713
The Korean War was going on at this time while you were at Texas A&M, and you had the opportunity, though, to stay in school and finish your education before you went into the service, right?

03:24.733 --> 03:25.254
That's right.

03:25.314 --> 03:29.499
Because I was in the Air Force ROTC, I was allowed to stay in school.

03:30.220 --> 03:36.608
However, I saw a number of my friends grafted out of school during the Korean conflict.

03:37.145 --> 03:41.770
We were all prepared to go and serve in that conflict had it gone on.

03:43.132 --> 03:51.261
But it ended before my graduation and actually during about the time of my graduation, the country had gone into a demobilization.

03:52.182 --> 03:57.428
And in fact, several of my classmates did not get commissioned to come into the Air Force.

03:57.448 --> 04:03.034
They'd been in the ROTC, but the Air Force decided they didn't need as many people then.

04:03.352 --> 04:13.966
They said, unless you're a technical major in a technical field or you want to fly, we're not going to bring you in as a second lieutenant.

04:13.986 --> 04:17.050
I was an ag major, but they let me come in to be a pilot.

04:17.771 --> 04:25.361
And again, a number of my classmates did not make it in initially anyway, but I think the Air Force later relented and did commission those folks.

04:25.601 --> 04:27.143
Graduated from A&M May of 1954.

04:27.704 --> 04:30.608
A couple of months later, you were on active duty and you did want to fly.

04:30.908 --> 04:35.815
You went to Randolph down in San Antonio for a while, but then you went to a contract flying school in Arizona.

04:35.835 --> 04:36.936
Talk about what that was about.

04:36.976 --> 04:42.244
Okay, in those days, flying training was done by private contractors.

04:42.264 --> 04:52.478
There were seven or eight of these around the country, and I was named to go to Arizona, a place called Marana, Arizona, a little place in the desert about 30 miles north of Tucson.

04:53.399 --> 04:58.787
After two weeks of indoctrination in San Antonio, I did move on to Arizona.

04:59.247 --> 05:00.409
I was married then.

05:00.693 --> 05:09.264
And my wife and I lived in Tucson, and we commuted, those of us in the military, up to Marana each day to fly.

05:09.865 --> 05:14.471
I was in class mostly with West Point and Naval Academy graduates.

05:14.491 --> 05:17.235
They had all come on duty, those who graduated in 54.

05:17.515 --> 05:20.920
In May they graduated, so they brought them right on in.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.643
So they were a little bit ahead of us in data rank and all.

05:24.344 --> 05:26.367
That was a big thing to us back in those days.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.790
These guys had a data rank on us.

05:28.810 --> 05:29.451
But...

05:29.785 --> 05:39.577
Anyway, I began flying training there in July, and some great people in those classes, some of them went on to make four-star general.

05:40.678 --> 05:44.283
One of them, David Scott, became one of the first astronauts.

05:44.303 --> 05:49.089
A guy that was in my class won the aerobatics competition among our class.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.975
But that first day of flying, I was eager for it.

05:55.116 --> 05:58.240
My time to fly was in the afternoon, early afternoon.

05:58.928 --> 06:05.379
Not knowing better, I'd gone to the dining hall and had a good meal and tanked up on a big piece of cherry pie.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.483
I thought, this is all pretty good.

06:07.503 --> 06:19.384
But reported to the ready room, and we got a briefing from our instructor, and my time to fly came, and it was very hot, above 100 degrees.

06:19.752 --> 06:21.775
We went out, took off.

06:22.236 --> 06:27.083
It was so-called dollar ride, meaning I wasn't really responsible for anything.

06:27.184 --> 06:29.006
I wasn't being evaluated, per se.

06:29.768 --> 06:33.333
But he showed me some of the things about the airplane.

06:33.433 --> 06:39.803
We kind of flew around the edges of the area that we would be working in, and he pointed out some landmarks to me.

06:40.222 --> 06:44.287
I could see the big cactus down there, 20 feet tall or more.

06:44.307 --> 06:48.011
A lot of cotton field, cotton five, six feet tall.

06:48.592 --> 06:51.375
And he told me if you ever have to crash, you know, put it on the cotton.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.619
That'll cushion your crash.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.401
I think that was good advice.

06:56.441 --> 06:57.382
I never had to do that.

06:57.502 --> 07:02.568
But anyway, after he'd done that, he said, well, what would you like to do?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.491
And I said, you know, I don't know.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.672
I don't know any maneuvers.

07:06.158 --> 07:12.166
So about that time, he pulled a thing up in a sharp climb and rolled it and put it in a barrel roll is what he did.

07:12.727 --> 07:18.494
And immediately, all I could see is the world spinning around underneath me through a plexiglass canopy.

07:19.115 --> 07:24.542
And about that time, my cherry pie and everything came up and I was sick as I could be.

07:25.323 --> 07:29.368
Well, we landed and my job was to clean up the airplane as is the custom.

07:30.129 --> 07:32.693
And I was directed to the flight surgeon to seek help.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.997
But I found a lot of my classmates over there that day.

07:36.432 --> 07:43.765
The flight surgeon didn't tell us too much, but anyway, I was worried that I might not make this thing.

07:44.226 --> 07:45.448
I didn't want to be a failure.

07:45.468 --> 07:47.492
I came there to fly and succeed.

07:49.135 --> 07:54.364
But the next day I talked to my flight instructor about it and he said, we're going to put you to work today.

07:54.384 --> 07:56.207
He said, I want you to control the airplane.

07:56.227 --> 07:57.850
I'm going to talk you through everything.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.225
You know, from that day on, I never had another problem getting air sick flying an airplane.

08:02.305 --> 08:03.246
That's interesting.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.169
As long as you were the pilot, you had no problem.

08:05.429 --> 08:05.549
Right.

08:05.569 --> 08:09.354
But you say to this day, when you're a passenger on a plane, you could still get wheezes, right?

08:09.374 --> 08:17.143
If I'm tucked back in the back and they're doing some pretty violent maneuvers or something, or something like that can make me a little green.

08:17.864 --> 08:18.565
I can understand.

08:18.945 --> 08:25.033
You left Arizona in 1955, went to San Angelo, and your first multi-engine experience was with B-25s, right?

08:25.113 --> 08:26.014
That's right.

08:26.804 --> 08:30.910
They decided I should go to multi-engines, and that was OK with me.

08:31.951 --> 08:33.153
San Angelo was fine.

08:33.213 --> 08:37.639
That's not far from where I grew up, but I could go see some of the folks once in a while, I thought.

08:38.641 --> 08:44.349
So I checked in there, and they were flying the B-25, which was a famous World War II bomber.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.872
In fact, it's the one that

08:47.189 --> 08:51.196
they flew the Tokyo Raid with, that was the B-25.

08:52.718 --> 08:57.647
But they saved a lot of these and they were the airplane we were using for multi-engine training.

08:57.787 --> 09:04.739
So I spent six months in San Angelo, dodging thunderstorms in West Texas in the spring.

09:05.079 --> 09:12.572
Fortunately we had some because those were drought years and I remember one day when it turned pitch black at three o'clock in the afternoon due to a sandstorm.

09:12.822 --> 09:20.190
But I had good experiences there and graduated on, I believe, the 1st of August, 1955 with my wings.

09:20.410 --> 09:24.875
Went on to Carswell in Fort Worth, where you were assigned a B-36 unit.

09:24.895 --> 09:28.178
You told a story about having seen the movie with Jimmy Stewart, and they flew B-36.

09:28.619 --> 09:30.901
You were pretty excited you were going to fly that big plane.

09:30.921 --> 09:33.704
Well, yes and no, I guess.

09:33.724 --> 09:34.445
I was afraid.

09:34.525 --> 09:35.186
I was scared.

09:35.346 --> 09:37.428
It came as such a surprise.

09:37.468 --> 09:42.694
Like I said, I had seen this movie, Strategic Air Command, with Jimmy Stewart.

09:43.079 --> 09:51.811
My wife and I had watched it within six weeks of my graduation, and it never occurred to me that I might end up in that.

09:51.832 --> 09:57.299
But that was my order when I graduated along with a few others in my class.

09:57.420 --> 10:06.412
We were sent to Carswell to sort of be a test program to see if young guys right out of flying school could work their way into the B-36 program.

10:07.113 --> 10:09.677
When I got to Carswell, I found that

10:10.130 --> 10:14.474
Most of the crew members there were lieutenant colonels and majors, a few captains.

10:14.875 --> 10:19.659
Nearly everyone was a World War II experienced person.

10:19.719 --> 10:24.244
People that I respected and really looked up to, a lot of them had a spot promotion.

10:24.264 --> 10:28.648
General LeMay was the commander of SAC at the time and he really had it going.

10:29.849 --> 10:37.977
He had some way gotten approval to grant spot promotions to people who were doing exceptionally well.

10:38.446 --> 10:42.973
Crew duty was pretty quantifiable in bombing and navigation and all of that.

10:43.694 --> 10:49.582
And he could pick out the crews that were the best and he could just say, you've got a spot promotion.

10:49.602 --> 10:53.748
And I looked at all these guys with spot promotions and this was really impressive to me.

10:54.429 --> 11:00.538
People that were really one rank ahead of what they were supposed to be and drawing the pay for it.

11:01.177 --> 11:12.713
Anyway, that's what I saw when I came there, and the second day I was there, they sent me down to a squadron to fly my first mission, and it was a 16-hour mission.

11:15.056 --> 11:18.881
I looked at that airplane and thought, you know, I don't know how I could ever fly that.

11:18.901 --> 11:25.750
It was just so big and bulky and so complicated compared to the little planes that I'd flown in flying school.

11:26.422 --> 11:33.010
But anyway, I did make that flight, mostly in the radio room, sitting on the cold floor with a parachute on the back.

11:33.291 --> 11:38.978
One time they did say, get your helmet on, which was an old cloth helmet, and your oxygen mask.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.501
And we were pressure breathing at 40,000 feet.

11:41.521 --> 11:46.387
That was a requirement to try to make one bomb run, practice bomb run at 40,000 feet.

11:46.868 --> 11:48.149
I'd never been that high before.

11:48.930 --> 11:51.754
But I did get on the flight deck for a little bit of the flight.

11:52.156 --> 12:02.910
After it was all over, I thought it seemed like a week we'd been up and I still had some doubts whether this was for me and whether I'd done the right thing signing up for all of this.

12:03.071 --> 12:04.713
But things got a lot better.

12:04.733 --> 12:11.382
Eventually you got a thousand hours in that B-36 and you had one flight of 30 hours from England to Carswell.

12:11.482 --> 12:12.063
That's right.

12:13.184 --> 12:19.733
My unit deployed over to England there a couple of years after I came to Carswell.

12:20.320 --> 12:28.090
Coming back, we ran into severe headwinds, and it was almost a 30-hour flight coming back, and that's the longest flight I've ever made.

12:28.871 --> 12:28.991
Right.

12:29.011 --> 12:33.517
Eventually, the B-36 program was somewhat folded up, and it was converted to a B-52 program.

12:33.558 --> 12:34.459
You went to California.

12:34.499 --> 12:35.740
You trained as a co-pilot.

12:36.521 --> 12:40.387
Talk about aerial refueling, because this is when you got an experience with that.

12:41.007 --> 12:42.509
We didn't do that in the B-36.

12:42.730 --> 12:47.336
It was just, there's no capability for that, although we flew long missions.

12:47.356 --> 12:49.078
But in the B-52...

12:49.328 --> 12:58.822
It offered the opportunity to be refueled in flight from a tanker, a KC-97 or a KC-135.

12:58.842 --> 13:18.492
It meant that you had to maneuver the B-52 up in close proximity to that plane and close within a refueling envelope, which is just a few feet, and maintain that position for as long as the fuel was being transferred from the tanker to the bomber.

13:18.995 --> 13:22.078
My crew that was going through training, I was a co-pilot.

13:22.138 --> 13:24.261
My pilot had a hard time.

13:24.301 --> 13:27.304
In fact, he couldn't get within a mile of that tanker.

13:27.324 --> 13:32.449
It was, you know, just weaving in and out and just couldn't seem to get the concept.

13:32.469 --> 13:36.153
And finally, the instructor took control and said, let me show you how to do it.

13:37.014 --> 13:41.899
And I saw him working very hard, maneuver that airplane right under the tail of this tanker.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.223
And, you know, you could see the numbers and everything.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.145
You could read anything on that tanker.

13:47.682 --> 13:49.964
And we were so close it was scary.

13:51.266 --> 13:55.110
You know, it is formation at its tightest and stay there.

13:55.310 --> 13:59.735
And, you know, it looks so dangerous and so difficult to me watching him do this.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.759
And I thought to myself again, you know, I'm not sure I can do that.

14:03.779 --> 14:06.061
That just looks too hard, right?

14:06.081 --> 14:13.048
But as I've told others, sometimes training is just a day-by-day process.

14:13.088 --> 14:16.592
You learn a little bit and you build on that and pretty soon you can do that.

14:16.842 --> 14:19.045
And later on, I did learn to do that.

14:19.065 --> 14:25.455
And I wouldn't say I was all that great at it, but I could hang on and get the one gulfer sometimes.

14:25.956 --> 14:30.263
Eventually, you went back to Carswell, upgraded to aircraft commander.

14:30.283 --> 14:35.250
I want to stop now and go to some pictures, looking at some of the things that we've been talking about so far.

14:35.691 --> 14:41.079
And then we'll come back and talk about the involvement that you had militarily in the Cold War and eventually to Vietnam.

14:41.099 --> 14:42.822
Let's go ahead and get to some photographs.

14:42.842 --> 14:43.823
You can look at them right there.

14:43.863 --> 14:44.925
And there is a...

14:44.905 --> 14:47.808
young Thomas Darling, about how old were you then?

14:47.828 --> 14:48.770
Well, let's see.

14:49.611 --> 14:50.512
How old was I?

14:50.552 --> 14:56.939
Let's see, I was about seven, eight years in the service, so that made about 29 probably.

14:56.959 --> 14:57.160
Okay.

14:57.820 --> 14:58.661
Let's go to the next picture.

14:58.681 --> 15:00.443
I think we're going to go back in history somewhere.

15:00.463 --> 15:04.408
You're a student at Texas A&M, and there you're sitting on Sol Ross's shoulder.

15:04.468 --> 15:08.533
Well, Sol Ross was big to us back in those days, and

15:08.800 --> 15:09.221
I don't know.

15:09.241 --> 15:16.073
We were clowning around one day and making pictures, and I climbed up on Sully, and somebody made my picture there.

15:16.714 --> 15:17.796
That's a great photograph.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.319
All right, let's move on.

15:20.682 --> 15:29.538
There's the basketball team, 50-51 Texas A&M basketball team, and you're number 56 there, front row, just right there, middle right.

15:29.898 --> 15:30.319
Well...

15:30.839 --> 15:34.482
I didn't even know this shot was still around.

15:34.502 --> 15:40.107
A couple of weeks ago at the football game, they focused on number 33, front and center, Tex Farmer.

15:40.748 --> 15:47.113
They highlighted him for his contributions through the 12th man and all the good things that he's done.

15:47.153 --> 15:50.817
He was a good friend, but they had him circled in white.

15:51.277 --> 15:54.240
And I looked at that picture and I said, that's me next to him.

15:54.260 --> 15:58.263
And sure enough, that is me, number 56 there on the front.

15:58.303 --> 16:00.205
But to my left,

16:00.505 --> 16:07.142
To the right, as you're looking at the pictures, this fellow, Jewel McDowell, I told you, was one of the greatest basketball players I ever knew.

16:07.203 --> 16:09.468
He was an All-American player that year.

16:10.110 --> 16:13.519
And the tallest guy on the back row, number 98, is Buddy Davis.

16:13.988 --> 16:19.778
who became a high jumper because he didn't like to go out for spring basketball practice we had in those days.

16:19.798 --> 16:25.588
He wanted to do track so he could avoid spring basketball, I think.

16:25.608 --> 16:29.935
Anyway, he became an Olympic high jump champion and a professional basketball player.

16:30.095 --> 16:33.201
I guess that picture was taken back at the old DeWare Fieldhouse, is that right?

16:33.221 --> 16:34.663
That's the DeWare Fieldhouse, that's right.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.255
How about that?

16:36.275 --> 16:38.238
And that's the new coach, John Floyd, on the right.

16:38.659 --> 16:39.100
Right.

16:39.120 --> 16:39.521
Here you are.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.463
Talk about this picture.

16:40.483 --> 16:41.565
We moved forward a little bit.

16:42.306 --> 16:46.274
Well, this was a PR picture, I would say, made during flying school.

16:46.294 --> 16:53.348
We didn't even wear that kind of helmet, but they put a helmet and a scarf on us to dress us up, make us look like aviators, I guess.

16:53.428 --> 16:55.993
But that's while I was going through flying school.

16:56.513 --> 16:58.195
All right.

16:58.215 --> 17:00.057
You got that PR smile.

17:00.077 --> 17:00.938
What are we looking at here?

17:01.279 --> 17:01.860
Okay.

17:02.380 --> 17:12.673
We talked a minute ago about me being at Carswell, and this was my first crew when I had upgraded to Aircraft Commander, or first pilot, if you would.

17:12.873 --> 17:13.594
Your middle front.

17:13.914 --> 17:24.327
Me there, center front, but six members on a B-52 crew, and the fellow there on the left, little guy,

17:24.712 --> 17:30.817
was a second lieutenant, one of the sharpest guys I've ever known, most eager pilot or flyer I've ever known.

17:32.038 --> 17:42.447
He came in with two years of college through the Aviation Cadet Program and eventually got his degree through bootstrap and finally a master's degree.

17:43.909 --> 17:46.571
He went to Vietnam and went through pilot training later.

17:46.611 --> 17:53.757
He was a navigator there, but he went to Vietnam, was shot down in an F-4 and picked up.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.412
Later made two-star general.

17:55.993 --> 17:56.774
I'll be darned.

17:56.794 --> 18:01.241
The guy in the back center was my electronic warfare officer.

18:01.301 --> 18:02.162
He was an Aggie.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.988
He had an electrical engineering degree from Texas A&M.

18:06.008 --> 18:13.620
And the guy on the right back there was my radar navigator, was the guy that put the bombs on the target and was really good at it.

18:13.640 --> 18:21.111
But a great young crew there, and we settled in and had a great run as a crew there at Carswell.

18:21.648 --> 18:23.770
All right, let's move on to the next picture.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.414
This is the B-36, right?

18:26.434 --> 18:29.337
Yeah, this backs up a little bit to my B-36 days.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.542
This is a B-36 in the background there.

18:33.562 --> 18:43.473
You can't quite see all of it, but some may remember it had six pusher-type props on the back of the wing, plus two jets on each wing tip.

18:44.054 --> 18:48.659
A total of 10 engines on this airplane, four jets and four pusher-type props.

18:49.801 --> 18:50.862
Massive airplane.

18:51.449 --> 18:59.597
That's the ninth bomb squadron lined up there beside this airplane, and I'm in that picture somewhere.

18:59.617 --> 19:04.421
I've never tried to figure out where I am, but I can remember when that picture was made.

19:04.441 --> 19:11.628
I can imagine that any young flyer looking at the mass of that airplane would be somewhat intimidated thinking that they were going to be in command of it.

19:11.648 --> 19:15.912
Well, that was me the day I signed in at Carswell.

19:15.932 --> 19:16.272
All right.

19:16.412 --> 19:18.334
I think here's the...

19:18.787 --> 19:22.612
Great picture of a B-52 in two of three planes that are in formation.

19:22.893 --> 19:26.798
I think the picture is actually being taken by the third plane that's in formation.

19:26.818 --> 19:38.995
Well, a B-52 came into the inventory about 1955-56, starting with the A model, and they went all the way through the H model, which is still flying today.

19:39.015 --> 19:42.820
I think there are still less than 100 B-52s in the active inventory.

19:44.122 --> 19:46.806
But this airplane has been around over 50 years.

19:46.866 --> 19:47.747
It's hard to believe.

19:48.402 --> 19:59.031
But when I came back from training in California to Carswell to pick up my own crew and begin operating there, we flew in brand new airplanes from the factory.

19:59.051 --> 19:59.531
Indeed.

19:59.551 --> 20:01.413
F models is what we were getting.

20:02.894 --> 20:08.999
This picture, you were on the right, and tell people who the older lady is.

20:09.019 --> 20:15.905
Well, that's Mrs. Douglas MacArthur there in the front row shaking hands with the officer.

20:17.186 --> 20:18.207
This was...

20:18.507 --> 20:24.617
A few years later when I was at the Armed Forces Staff College, which is a joint school.

20:25.319 --> 20:33.633
It was really designed to teach joint operations, coalition planning, joint planning.

20:33.653 --> 20:43.249
All of our streets and buildings and everything were named after some joint operation or some joint name, but we didn't have a name on our auditorium.

20:43.921 --> 20:49.467
and decided that maybe we ought to name that MacArthur Auditorium.

20:49.487 --> 20:51.970
Mrs. MacArthur came to Norfolk frequently.

20:52.371 --> 20:53.752
Her husband is buried there.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.235
She thought it was a wonderful idea.

20:56.836 --> 21:03.624
So she came for a big ceremony we had when we named the Auditorium, the MacArthur Auditorium.

21:05.245 --> 21:07.748
All right, let's move on to the last picture.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.391
This is your wife, Evelyn, on the right.

21:10.852 --> 21:11.953
You're getting promoted.

21:12.119 --> 21:18.046
This is my wife, Evelyn, on the right there, who was a great contributor to my career.

21:18.066 --> 21:20.249
I give her great credit for that.

21:20.269 --> 21:23.153
But she served beside me for all my years.

21:23.974 --> 21:27.218
That's Vice Admiral John Sanderson on the left.

21:28.460 --> 21:35.148
They were pinning on my second star, which I received shortly after I went to the Armed Forces Staff College in 1972.

21:35.589 --> 21:35.849
All right.

21:37.711 --> 21:38.312
Very proud.

21:38.596 --> 21:40.839
We've got a few minutes left here in this show.

21:40.859 --> 21:46.367
And again, we're going to be visiting with General Darling the next show also, because there's a lot of story to tell.

21:46.728 --> 21:50.032
We're gonna fast forward though, October of 62, the Cuban Missile Crisis.

21:50.052 --> 21:56.782
A lot of people of our age certainly remember those 13 days of crisis in world politics.

21:56.922 --> 22:02.310
And talk about what your involvement was with the B-52 in that crisis.

22:02.330 --> 22:04.513
Well, those were very interesting times.

22:04.533 --> 22:05.835
As you know, they had,

22:06.895 --> 22:16.089
The U-2 plane had taken photos of missiles in Cuba that the Soviets had moved in there and became very threatening to the United States and allies.

22:17.111 --> 22:24.422
And I remember being at the officer's club one day and got a message to report to the commander's office immediately.

22:24.442 --> 22:30.692
And when I did, I was told that my crew would be launching the next night on what we called airborne alerts.

22:31.499 --> 22:37.629
which is a 24-hour mission where everything is loaded and cocked and you're ready to go to war.

22:37.649 --> 22:51.713
We had flown some of these missions during more peaceful times to make sure we were sending a signal to the Soviets that we're doing this kind of thing and kind of give them notice.

22:51.733 --> 22:57.523
But when this Cuban Missile thing came up, SAC decided to launch

22:57.638 --> 23:03.945
I believe it was over 60 B-52s on airborne alert from different places, different bases.

23:04.405 --> 23:07.509
But these airplanes were kept up 24 hours a day.

23:07.809 --> 23:11.413
Each plane would fly a 24-hour mission, but they'd be replaced.

23:11.433 --> 23:19.882
But we did that throughout the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I flew a number of these 24-hour missions where we had nuclear weapons on board.

23:20.062 --> 23:21.864
Everything was armed.

23:21.884 --> 23:25.148
We had targets assigned to strike if we got the GO code.

23:25.685 --> 23:36.642
We took off and flew over the Atlantic and over Spain and refueled with a tanker out of Spain, taking on 125,000 pounds of fuel.

23:36.722 --> 23:49.882
We'd fly on down the Mediterranean, turn around, come back, refuel a second time over Spain, head back down the Mediterranean, and then turn around just so we would have enough fuel to get all the way back home.

23:49.902 --> 23:54.409
But all along there, we were vulnerable to be given the go code

23:54.997 --> 24:00.944
where we would be committed to go strike targets in the Soviet Union.

24:01.585 --> 24:10.976
And each day when we would fly home back across the Atlantic, I could see the Soviet ships, the armada of ships that were headed for Cuba.

24:10.996 --> 24:17.063
And, you know, we'd look at that and really wonder, you know, what's going to happen?

24:17.083 --> 24:22.810
But it was a time of great stress, and I think it's the closest we ever came to nuclear war.

24:23.431 --> 24:26.295
In fact, a lot of us believed it was pretty imminent at the time.

24:26.895 --> 24:50.485
But thank goodness, through in part our action to fly these 24-hour missions, but the fact that SAC put over 1,500 airplanes dispersed throughout the United States on alert with weapons on board, all of that, I think, caused Mr. Khrushchev to blink and back up, and he did turn those ships around.

24:50.525 --> 24:51.767
But we did that...

24:52.912 --> 24:58.418
well, roughly three weeks in there, and a very critical time in our history.

24:58.438 --> 24:59.599
Eventually, we move on.

25:00.220 --> 25:02.062
You were deployed to Vietnam.

25:02.082 --> 25:06.347
Vietnam came along in around 1965, and you were deployed at Vietnam.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.009
I'd like to start the story here.

25:08.029 --> 25:14.296
We've got a couple of minutes left, and then we'll pick it up again next week, but you were actually deployed to Guam as a B-52 pilot.

25:14.316 --> 25:14.756
That's right.

25:14.817 --> 25:21.484
I was stationed at Turner Air Force Base in Albany, Georgia, had a B-52 crew, and our...

25:21.582 --> 25:24.325
Wing was outfitted with the Big Belly Bomber.

25:25.186 --> 25:32.654
That's the name we used then to describe the enhancement to carry large numbers of conventional bombs.

25:32.674 --> 25:37.559
In fact, we could carry 108 500-pound bombs.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.922
24 on the pylons of the wing, but the others internally.

25:41.463 --> 25:48.130
So we deployed to Guam and participated in mostly saturation bombing.

25:48.616 --> 25:50.098
Not all of it was that.

25:50.358 --> 25:58.688
I remember within two or three weeks after I was there, we were directed to launch on this big mission that would take us into North Vietnam.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.130
It was the Mugia Pass.

26:00.230 --> 26:09.721
It was a steep tunnel area, a cliff area on each side with the Viet Cong sending their supplies down there, the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

26:10.261 --> 26:17.610
Thinking was if we could stop that supply route, cut it off, that we could have an impact on the war.

26:18.063 --> 26:22.215
Well, I remember one night we launched 60 airplanes one minute apart.

26:22.857 --> 26:28.634
All our tankers were there on Guam with us because they'd evacuated due to a typhoon in Okinawa.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.903
But they were there with us and we launched those 60 airplanes which

26:32.187 --> 26:43.303
A minute apart without one hiccup, without one substitution or anything, one of the most amazing aviation feats I've ever known as far as launching big airplanes like that with total success.

26:43.984 --> 26:48.270
The mission had all the trappings of full combat.

26:48.290 --> 26:59.005
We went radio silence, lights out and all of that, but you could hear it on the radios and you could hear all the stuff going from sounds and people dodging them.

26:59.626 --> 27:02.295
to MIGs and all the things at work.

27:02.478 --> 27:08.385
I'll tell you what, we're going to pick it up right there on the next show because there's a lot more to tell, including your career at Texas A&M.

27:08.425 --> 27:09.727
Thank you, and we'll be back next week.

27:10.428 --> 27:15.995
As you would guess, General Thomas Darling's story of service to his country and eventually to his school does not end there.

27:16.055 --> 27:17.717
It's indeed barely started.

27:17.737 --> 27:31.033
There's Naval War College, his stand at the Pentagon, commander of a B-52 bomb wing, various assignments with the Strategic Air Command, Commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College, and all that before coming back to Texas A&M as Corps Commandant.

27:31.013 --> 27:47.179
I'm Tom Turbeville, so please join us next time as we continue our visit with Major General Thomas G. Darling on Veterans of the Valley.

27:55.453 --> 27:55.553
