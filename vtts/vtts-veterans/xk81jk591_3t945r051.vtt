00:15.809 --> 00:39.681
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.243
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.780 --> 00:45.701
Did you know that there is a Texas A&M University Veterans Association?

00:45.781 --> 00:47.993
Well, the problem is that most of you don't know that.

00:48.378 --> 00:50.542
and their aim is to change all that.

00:50.562 --> 00:59.096
And one big step in that recognition process happened Saturday, October 30th at Kyle Field, halftime at the A&M versus Iowa State football game.

00:59.116 --> 01:10.615
64 current students at Texas A&M were saluted by more than 86,000 fans, including former president and World War II veteran George Bush, for their service in the war on terror.

01:10.635 --> 01:15.162
Current students who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, it was a remarkable ceremony.

01:15.142 --> 01:22.950
that was pulled together with the help and the planning of the Office of Veterans Services at A&M and the Texas A&M Veterans Association.

01:22.970 --> 01:25.132
Their president is Mike Jarvis, U.S.

01:25.232 --> 01:29.437
Army veteran of service in Germany and Bosnia in the mid 90s.

01:29.457 --> 01:32.820
Mike, you kind of started off in the Army a little bit early, 17 years old.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.941
You were in the state of Washington.

01:33.961 --> 01:37.945
You were in high school, 93 it was, and decided to get into the Army.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.307
Talk about that decision.

01:39.327 --> 01:39.907
That's correct.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.689
My uncle was an Army recruiter.

01:42.091 --> 01:53.061
for the reserves, and we decided that the best way for me to be successful was to enter the Army early, and so I made that decision and I entered boot camp between my junior and senior year of high school.

01:53.342 --> 01:54.663
And boot camp didn't scare you off.

01:54.923 --> 02:00.048
You came back, I believe you finished school, and then you didn't go reserves, you went into active duty, is that right?

02:00.068 --> 02:00.428
Correct.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.669
I wasn't happy in the reserves.

02:02.010 --> 02:10.798
I wanted to enter the active status and change my job, and I decided that combat engineering was for me,

02:11.302 --> 02:12.644
It looked exciting.

02:12.664 --> 02:13.646
And that's what you did.

02:13.686 --> 02:14.247
That's what I did.

02:14.307 --> 02:15.509
You became a combat engineer.

02:15.549 --> 02:19.476
We'll clean it up a little bit, but your motto was you built stuff and then you blew stuff up.

02:20.678 --> 02:21.399
That is correct.

02:22.340 --> 02:29.733
Definitely trained in the art of explosives and TNT, C4, and also construction.

02:30.654 --> 02:31.035
Right.

02:31.055 --> 02:31.736
Went to Fort Hood.

02:31.756 --> 02:34.120
You met a lady who would become your wife then.

02:34.370 --> 02:36.173
And you were there for about 18 months, I know.

02:36.193 --> 02:37.815
And then you were deployed to Germany.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.257
You went to Bamberg, Germany.

02:39.277 --> 02:41.400
And from there, you were deployed to Bosnia in 1996.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.044
It's a pretty hazardous duty there.

02:44.124 --> 02:46.747
Talk about your service in Germany and then in Bosnia.

02:47.288 --> 02:51.714
Right away as I entered Germany, the conflict in Bosnia was going on.

02:51.734 --> 02:57.943
And US forces were sent there basically as a peacekeeping mission.

02:57.963 --> 03:04.292
And our unit, our engineering unit, was charged with the task of disarming many of the mines that you

03:04.728 --> 03:06.450
heard about over here.

03:06.470 --> 03:27.191
You know there were millions of them and we basically spent a year over in Bosnia cleaning that up and I left I believe in in January of 1996 and we didn't return till November so it was a long tour and I don't want to leave that because I mean that was obviously pretty dangerous work just by the sound of it.

03:27.271 --> 03:33.638
I mean you were you were in situations that could have been quite hairy for you and quite damaging for you.

03:34.023 --> 03:42.416
And I believe you told me also that you sort of helped in the design of vehicles or robots that would do that stuff instead of human beings, right?

03:42.436 --> 03:43.097
That is correct.

03:43.157 --> 03:47.524
As you can imagine, the disarmament of mines is a very dangerous job.

03:48.566 --> 03:54.876
You have to be well trained, but that doesn't always mean you're going to be safe.

03:55.076 --> 04:01.566
And so what we did over there, having so much time disarming these mines,

04:01.883 --> 04:10.596
we created equipment that was remote control and robots and stuff like that where they could do the job for us.

04:10.616 --> 04:13.761
And so that alleviated some of our manpower.

04:13.781 --> 04:15.884
It was actually on the ground searching for mines.

04:16.585 --> 04:23.335
We could actually employ 60 ton tanks or small little robots to go out and find the mines and disarm them.

04:23.770 --> 04:26.112
And remarkably, you had no casualties in your unit.

04:26.132 --> 04:31.877
The 16th engineers that became the 54th engineers, and you had no casualties, so you were obviously pretty good at your job.

04:32.337 --> 04:32.998
I'd like to think so.

04:34.039 --> 04:35.300
Because you're here to tell us about it.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.001
Correct.

04:36.021 --> 04:40.304
You left Germany in December of 98, and you actually got out.

04:40.424 --> 04:42.006
The timing was something you told me.

04:42.326 --> 04:44.428
It was just a few days before 9-11, is that right?

04:44.448 --> 04:45.349
Timing was remarkable.

04:45.389 --> 04:52.815
After my tour in Germany, I went to Fort Carson, Colorado, finished up my last couple of years of my enlistment,

04:53.251 --> 04:55.654
and decided I was gonna go to college.

04:55.674 --> 05:04.847
Well, when I got out, I got out August 30th of 2001, and on my way from Colorado down here to Texas, it was when?

05:04.867 --> 05:05.688
9-11 happened.

05:05.708 --> 05:06.289
9-11 happened.

05:06.469 --> 05:07.651
So how'd you get to Texas A&M?

05:07.671 --> 05:10.054
I know your wife was a Texan and that had something to do with it, right?

05:10.075 --> 05:10.515
Correct.

05:11.016 --> 05:13.519
My wife and I, we've been married 10 years now.

05:13.900 --> 05:19.748
Her family's from Fort Worth, and we made the decision that we wanted to be close to her family.

05:19.998 --> 05:29.289
when we had kids and we got two beautiful girls and they get a chance to be around their grandparents and Texas A&M was a perfect fit for me.

05:29.910 --> 05:34.576
I was interested in an engineering degree and it's one of the best in the nation so.

05:34.596 --> 05:37.079
And that's what you're currently actually enrolled in school.

05:37.099 --> 05:37.640
Correct.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.622
Going for your degree in agricultural engineering.

05:39.642 --> 05:40.724
That is correct.

05:40.744 --> 05:41.164
That's correct.

05:41.184 --> 05:43.147
I'm an agricultural engineering student.

05:43.227 --> 05:44.368
What are you gonna do with that?

05:45.108 --> 05:45.830
That's a good question.

05:48.478 --> 05:54.055
I'm gearing it towards natural resources, water resources in that area.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.802
We'll work on that when we get there.

05:56.842 --> 05:59.886
Let's talk about the Texas A&M Veterans Association.

05:59.946 --> 06:04.151
It was actually started 10 years ago, but it's gone through some rough times, recognition times.

06:04.171 --> 06:07.415
You even told me that a couple of years, it almost dissolved, as a matter of fact.

06:07.435 --> 06:12.000
But you got interested in it, you and some of your buddies, and sort of breathed new life into it.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.244
Talk about the association and sort of what it does and what its goals are.

06:15.464 --> 06:15.724
Okay.

06:15.744 --> 06:17.887
Our association was founded 10 years ago.

06:17.907 --> 06:19.309
We just had our 10-year reunion.

06:20.510 --> 06:24.835
Like you said, we had some rough years, and those rough years were recently.

06:25.355 --> 06:32.008
our membership had dropped to real low numbers.

06:33.571 --> 06:45.574
Working in the Veterans Services office, a group of guys there, we decided that the organization had a lot of potential and we wanted to carry it

06:46.516 --> 07:06.330
on our backs and so we got involved with it with the officers and the group of people that were carrying it with such low numbers and like you said, breathed new life into it and this year we flourished and our motto this year is to get our name out and let people know who we are

07:06.783 --> 07:07.504
what we're doing.

07:07.525 --> 07:14.840
And our mission is, we're a community service oriented organization.

07:15.782 --> 07:22.676
We wanna get out there and work with the community, but we're also a social organization.

07:23.097 --> 07:24.640
That's very important to us.

07:24.620 --> 07:29.265
but also we're the voice of the veterans on campus.

07:29.586 --> 07:30.006
Exactly.

07:30.647 --> 07:33.811
And so we're using that to the best of our abilities.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.353
And that's a very important thing.

07:35.393 --> 07:46.746
I know that you told me the other day when we were visiting that this organization, one reason it was created is there was a need for an organization to address who you all are, more mature students, students that have

07:46.979 --> 07:55.248
been around the world, literally, and seen things that the normal just incoming freshmen wouldn't have seen, people that for the large part are married, maybe even have families.

07:55.889 --> 08:01.255
And this was a group that for you all to hang with, and that was one of the reasons that the organization was formed.

08:01.295 --> 08:05.660
And you keep sort of thriving on that type of identity, right?

08:06.040 --> 08:06.801
Correct.

08:06.821 --> 08:11.586
That was one of the biggest interests that I had in the organization is that I could

08:12.747 --> 08:36.898
I could meet up with former service members, whether I was former Army, whether they were Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, they'd all been deployed, they'd all served, and we had common ground there to work with, and we're quite different from the traditional student, the 18, 19-year-old student coming out of high school, so to have that common ground is

08:37.233 --> 08:38.594
is rewarding.

08:38.614 --> 08:44.479
Now as a student, I know you spend a couple of hours a day, even more I'm sure on some days, working over at the Veteran Services Office.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.141
This is a different organization.

08:46.181 --> 08:50.224
The university gives you space over in the pavilion building.

08:50.385 --> 08:52.927
Talk a little bit about what that office does.

08:53.007 --> 08:59.112
I know it's very important what you do for veterans, especially those that are deployed and coming back to Texas A&M.

08:59.933 --> 09:00.894
Talk more about what they do.

09:01.835 --> 09:05.518
The Veterans Service Office is a real pivotal

09:06.511 --> 09:10.015
point for Texas A&M veterans.

09:10.035 --> 09:21.228
What we do in that office, we hand out educational benefits for former service members, also active service members who are here getting their education.

09:22.230 --> 09:27.796
But what we do in that office, one, it's a safe haven for military veterans.

09:27.836 --> 09:33.683
When they come to Texas A&M University, a lot of them just don't know where to go, they don't know

09:33.983 --> 09:44.678
who to talk to, and if they look us up in the phone book or online, and they see that, they can give us a call, and we can help them out with anything that they have in the university.

09:45.259 --> 09:47.342
Yeah, I look at it as almost like a USO on Texas A&M.

09:47.362 --> 09:48.463
Kind of like that, exactly.

09:48.523 --> 09:49.665
Just a place to go.

09:49.705 --> 09:56.014
You go around airports and you see USOs, veterans will go in there to talk to other veterans, and this is kind of the service you provide.

09:56.454 --> 10:03.484
One very important thing that I know that you were very involved in this past summer was a way to reorganize or redo the way

10:03.717 --> 10:08.727
that veterans that are deployed reaccess college after they have already served.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.716
It was a problem before, it's not a problem now, and you all had a lot to do with that.

10:12.976 --> 10:16.323
I want you to talk specifically about what happened and how that went about.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.950
We saw that there was a problem on campus.

10:20.371 --> 10:23.177
I believe the battalion even ran a story

10:23.630 --> 10:32.867
on actually one of the Purple Heart recipients this weekend, Joe Gonzalez, had a problem re-entering Texas A&M after he was deployed.

10:32.887 --> 10:45.570
So what was happening was as a student deployed, they had to withdraw from the university, then go overseas, do their service, but when they came back,

10:46.006 --> 10:49.451
they were withdrawn and they had to actually go through the whole reapplication process.

10:50.993 --> 10:54.298
Some of them were required to pay the reapplication fee.

10:55.260 --> 10:58.465
Some of them, their residential status changed.

10:58.485 --> 11:08.400
It was a mess and we saw the need to fix that and we got with university officials and they agreed with the problem and it was actually fixed immediately.

11:08.420 --> 11:14.629
Dr. Mark Weichold was real pivotal in that and real supportive with that.

11:15.537 --> 11:19.622
So now when a student is deployed, their contact point is you.

11:19.723 --> 11:24.609
When they're leaving, they go to you, they find out what they can expect when they get back.

11:24.629 --> 11:26.351
They go off, they serve, they come back.

11:26.652 --> 11:31.017
Immediately they come to your office and you kind of help cut through the red tape.

11:31.057 --> 11:36.605
You're a little bit of an advocate for them in getting right back into school and not having to jump a lot of hurdles, right?

11:36.665 --> 11:37.125
That's correct.

11:37.145 --> 11:39.649
The whole process is streamlined.

11:39.669 --> 11:40.650
When a veteran leaves,

11:40.968 --> 11:43.777
the last person that they're going to talk with is us.

11:43.797 --> 11:46.967
And when they come back, the first person they're going to talk to is us again.

11:47.589 --> 11:52.986
And the whole process is extremely beneficial to the veterans now.

11:53.017 --> 11:59.425
We're going to talk a lot more about the Veterans Association and about the Veterans Services Office at Texas A&M.

11:59.845 --> 12:05.192
But you heard us refer to what happened the weekend of October the 30th at Texas A&M.

12:05.212 --> 12:10.578
If you were one of the 86,000 that were at the game, you saw it, the salute to the veterans.

12:10.618 --> 12:18.568
And these were veterans that are currently receiving educational services from Texas A&M who have already served in either Iraq or Afghanistan.

12:18.548 --> 12:22.032
I want to start off with a video that all of you saw that were at the football game.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.754
If you were there, you probably want to see it again.

12:23.794 --> 12:25.637
If you weren't there, you need to see it.

12:25.657 --> 12:36.630
This was a video, by the way, that was supplied by the Association of Former Students, and I want to say that it was edited by Sean Iyer, class of 95, a veteran of Desert Storm.

12:36.650 --> 12:44.659
Sean did a great job in editing this video, and we want to go to it right now, and it starts with University President Dr. Robert Gates and his welcome.

12:44.679 --> 12:45.180
Here it is.

12:47.084 --> 12:47.465
Howdy.

12:48.106 --> 12:50.870
I'm Robert Gates, President of Texas A&M University.

12:51.651 --> 13:02.848
I'd like to welcome you to Kyle Field as we pay special tribute to the United States military, including the thousands of Aggies who have long and distinguished records of service to our country.

13:02.868 --> 13:09.818
Their acts of heroism in times of crisis is well noted and goes to the heart of what being an Aggie is all about.

13:10.844 --> 13:18.417
Today, we honor the fine men and women who represent the Aggie spirit in the ongoing mission of Operation Enduring Freedom.

13:19.840 --> 13:28.675
As we all know, freedom doesn't come without sacrifice, and six Aggies have paid the ultimate price in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

13:29.977 --> 13:36.328
Today, we honor the memory of those lost and the service of those who are still in harm's way around the world.

13:37.625 --> 13:52.807
A special thanks goes to all Aggie fans and to former students who have generously donated their tickets so that our service men and women might have the opportunity to enjoy one of the great aspects of Texas A&M, Aggie football.

13:52.827 --> 14:01.219
We will have a special halftime program today, which will close with an invitation to you to join in singing of God Bless America.

14:02.228 --> 14:10.315
We begin this tribute with a collection of photos sent to us by Aggies around the world who are on the front lines in service to our country.

14:11.599 --> 14:13.285
Thank you and Gig'em.

14:33.464 --> 14:59.472
Well, if you ask me where I come from Here's what I tell everyone I was born by God's dear grace In an extraordinary place Where the stars and stripes And the eagle flies

15:02.202 --> 15:07.449
It's a big old land with countless dreams.

15:07.469 --> 15:11.935
And happiness ain't out of reach.

15:11.955 --> 15:16.380
Hard work pays off the way it should.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.527
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good.

15:21.547 --> 15:27.855
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle flies.

15:30.907 --> 15:37.756
There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe.

15:40.239 --> 15:50.273
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it costs to be free.

15:50.293 --> 15:57.943
No, it ain't the only place on earth, but it's the only place that I prefer.

16:00.016 --> 16:04.406
To love my wife and raise my kids.

16:04.426 --> 16:07.133
Pay the same way that my daddy did.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.726
With stars and stripes.

16:45.072 --> 16:54.546
I want to thank Texas A&M Athletic Department and also thank Andy Richardson over at the A&M Photo Lab Department for supplying us with that video.

16:55.026 --> 17:10.729
And the Association of Former Students would like to tell everybody, all fans, everybody, all Aggies out there, that you can send your own online message to our troops by going onto their website, which is aggenetwork.com.

17:10.749 --> 17:11.991
Anyway, I want to thank...

17:11.971 --> 17:14.075
them for supplying us with that.

17:14.095 --> 17:15.136
It was a great weekend.

17:15.156 --> 17:15.798
It really was.

17:15.818 --> 17:17.480
And it didn't come together easily.

17:17.500 --> 17:22.249
I know you all had a lot to do with getting those 64 veterans there on the field.

17:22.870 --> 17:26.656
And of course, former President George Bush, it was just a tremendous afternoon.

17:26.676 --> 17:30.964
And you just had to be beaming because of the part that your association had to do with that.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.286
It was a tremendous success.

17:32.867 --> 17:33.608
Had a lot of

17:33.824 --> 17:34.966
players in it.

17:35.987 --> 17:44.621
Mike McKenzie over the athletic department asked me if I could somehow put together this group of 65, which ended up being 64.

17:44.982 --> 17:54.837
And at the veteran service office, you know, a little over a week's worth of time, we came up with 64 confirmations.

17:55.171 --> 17:56.292
Actually, there was more.

17:56.853 --> 17:58.975
We just could not get everybody out there.

17:59.276 --> 17:59.836
Indeed.

17:59.856 --> 18:00.818
Unfortunately.

18:00.838 --> 18:01.779
It was really tremendous.

18:02.139 --> 18:12.672
And everybody that was on that field are students that are receiving educational services from Texas A&M right now who served in Iraq or Afghanistan.

18:12.692 --> 18:18.238
And you told me that in all veterans that are receiving educational services right now, number over 300 now.

18:18.418 --> 18:18.999
That's correct.

18:19.019 --> 18:25.026
The numbers in the higher end of the 300s, we actually have over 400 students

18:25.445 --> 18:32.923
who somehow, some way have put on an application that they had military service or were currently serving.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.799
So there's quite a few veterans here on campus.

18:36.179 --> 18:37.020
Indeed.

18:37.040 --> 18:44.591
You took a lot of pictures from that day, and you took something like over 200 pictures that you showed me, and we were able to come up with a dozen or so.

18:44.631 --> 18:50.159
We want to go to those right now and let Mike Jarvis sort of talk about each of the pictures that we've chosen to put on.

18:50.480 --> 18:54.205
There, of course, is former President Bush and one of your compadres next to him.

18:54.225 --> 18:54.826
That's correct.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.308
Right next to him is Nick Lutton.

18:56.368 --> 19:02.978
He's the vice president of the association and also a veteran service employee.

19:03.532 --> 19:07.617
He served in Afghanistan and he actually helped raise the spirit flag.

19:08.779 --> 19:09.400
Great picture.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.222
That's how you just told the president a pretty funny joke.

19:11.743 --> 19:12.204
There you are.

19:12.224 --> 19:15.047
That's me with the F-18 pilots flying over.

19:15.067 --> 19:22.537
I'm sure most of the viewers or the people in the stands notice how low they flew the first flyby.

19:22.557 --> 19:24.460
There was, of course, two flybys.

19:25.418 --> 19:27.300
There's some of the folks that raised the flag.

19:27.580 --> 19:36.130
The fellow in front is Captain Tyson Vocal, two tours of Iraq, and viewers of Veterans of the Valley may recognize him.

19:36.150 --> 19:41.436
He was on just a couple of weeks ago as our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

19:41.456 --> 19:41.937
There you are.

19:42.618 --> 19:48.524
That's me down on the field trying to get everybody lined up and ready to go.

19:48.544 --> 19:50.987
Everybody's having just a wonderful time and

19:51.203 --> 19:53.426
That phone was going 100 miles an hour.

19:53.446 --> 19:54.107
They were having fun.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.569
You were trying to organize them all.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.492
I had a great time, though.

19:57.512 --> 20:00.196
Former president went down the line and shook hands with every one of them.

20:00.216 --> 20:00.856
That's correct.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.223
Right there is one of the Purple Heart.

20:05.423 --> 20:07.486
Actually, I believe that's both of the Purple Heart recipients.

20:07.926 --> 20:12.613
The one saluting President Bush is Mark McCain.

20:13.594 --> 20:17.700
His Bradley fighting vehicle was struck by a rocket propelled grenade.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.229
He actually lost his arm and received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart.

20:22.270 --> 20:27.736
And right next to him is the second Purple Heart recipient, Joe Gonzalez.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.445
These guys right here are Marine Corps active duty members.

20:37.005 --> 20:40.048
We call them short MESEP guys.

20:40.069 --> 20:44.413
They're all active duty and they're very pumped up that they got to meet President Bush.

20:46.773 --> 20:51.079
A lot of pictures of Mr. Luton and the president there.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.005
There's the president pinning the Purple Heart on one of the Purple Heart recipients.

20:56.306 --> 20:58.789
Crowd went absolutely nuts.

20:58.849 --> 21:03.115
I think that everybody felt pretty patriotic that day.

21:05.458 --> 21:09.443
And there's Dr. Gates and General Lord on the right side.

21:09.623 --> 21:14.029
I believe he's Air Force Base Command four-star general.

21:17.215 --> 21:18.536
And there's the flyby.

21:18.557 --> 21:22.201
You can look up there and see that was loud.

21:22.561 --> 21:26.165
I believe that was the second flyover because the first flyover was a lot lower.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.449
Indeed it was.

21:29.829 --> 21:31.371
That was a great day for you.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.755
Sort of after it was all over, what was some of the feedback that you got from everybody?

21:34.775 --> 21:39.880
I guess everybody was just obviously more pumped about that than they ended up being about the football game, unfortunately.

21:39.981 --> 21:42.103
But they were very excited about that ceremony.

21:42.123 --> 21:42.964
They were very excited.

21:42.984 --> 21:44.826
The phone was ringing off the hook.

21:45.329 --> 21:49.196
From the time the ceremony ended, in fact, we're still receiving calls.

21:49.236 --> 21:54.085
We've got guys coming up to our office, checking out the pictures, and we're providing them with photos.

21:54.887 --> 21:57.051
And I think it's going to last a little while.

21:57.312 --> 22:00.117
I think the former president was very moved by it also.

22:00.137 --> 22:05.226
I mean, he does ceremonies all the time in his retirement, but I think that this one really got him.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.232
He seemed to be really enjoying himself and being very proud.

22:08.802 --> 22:09.603
It really did.

22:10.785 --> 22:14.890
Penrod Thornton is his liaison for A&M.

22:14.910 --> 22:15.871
He works over at the Bush School.

22:16.011 --> 22:27.787
And he told me that President Bush was really interested in receiving as much information on the two Purple Heart recipients as he could.

22:27.807 --> 22:29.569
He was really excited to do this.

22:30.130 --> 22:37.459
After he pinned the Purple Heart and Bronze Stars on, he wanted to meet the family members, which he did.

22:37.912 --> 22:39.814
They were pretty excited.

22:39.894 --> 22:40.635
I bet they were.

22:40.995 --> 22:43.578
Texas A&M Veterans Association, you say that you've grown.

22:43.598 --> 22:45.120
You've grown to 25 or 30 members.

22:45.140 --> 22:47.042
You obviously want to grow even more.

22:47.543 --> 22:48.464
There's a veteran out there.

22:48.484 --> 22:52.949
If there's one of those 300 veterans out there that now know that you exist, how do they get in touch with you?

22:52.969 --> 22:53.809
How do they get involved?

22:54.690 --> 23:07.024
If there's a veteran out there that wants to get in touch with us, they can call us at the Veterans Service Office at 845-8075, or they can also get online at tamuveterans.com.

23:07.291 --> 23:13.420
TAMU.edu and that's our website and there's a forum and they can get on there and talk.

23:14.201 --> 23:26.099
I know one of the things Mike Jarvis that you all want to do is become more involved in the community and getting out there and just letting the community know that you do exist and that you're there to help them and that you're proud to be part of the community.

23:26.119 --> 23:27.221
That's part of what you want to do.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.242
Exactly what we want to do.

23:28.683 --> 23:29.644
Exactly, exactly.

23:30.065 --> 23:33.891
Congratulations on what happened on that Saturday at Kyle Field.

23:33.951 --> 23:35.593
It was truly magical and it was truly

23:35.793 --> 23:37.596
a great service to the veterans.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.603
And I know that they appreciated it and everybody appreciates the work that your organization did.

23:42.623 --> 23:43.284
Thank you very much.

23:43.304 --> 23:44.346
All right, keep going.

23:44.366 --> 23:45.067
That's Mike Jarvis.

23:45.087 --> 23:46.449
Thanks for visiting with us.

23:46.469 --> 23:51.716
So now you know about the Texas A&M Veterans Association and the Office of Veteran Services.

23:52.197 --> 23:57.465
Their passion is to serve well, those Aggies who have served us well.

23:57.485 --> 24:02.492
And thanks to Mike Jarvis for his army service in Germany and Bosnia and to all veterans.

24:02.472 --> 24:05.509
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

24:05.529 --> 24:06.535
I'm Tom Turbiville.

24:06.555 --> 24:09.411
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
