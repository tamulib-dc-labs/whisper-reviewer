00:01.381 --> 00:11.597
December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.

00:12.078 --> 00:17.607
We interrupt this broadcast bringing this important button from the United Press.

00:17.627 --> 00:19.069
Slash, Washington, the White House announces a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
[Music.]

00:33.275 --> 00:35.498
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.919 --> 00:37.901
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.921 --> 00:43.409
Bill Adams wanted to be in the Air Force in 1950 and really had no designs on being a mechanic.

00:43.990 --> 00:50.098
But that's where the Air Force needed him, so he learned the craft and for the next four years kept B-29s in the air.

00:50.679 --> 00:57.929
Not in frigid Korea where the war was going on, but among other places in steaming hot Saudi Arabia.

00:58.650 --> 01:02.235
Bill Adams is one of many veterans who served his country

01:02.823 --> 01:07.135
not in combat, but in still needed jobs that kept America safe.

01:07.797 --> 01:12.871
Please welcome Airman First Class Bill Adams to Veterans of the Valley.

01:12.891 --> 01:16.381
Bill, it's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley, and thank you again for your service.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.587
We had talked a little bit about

01:19.327 --> 01:26.836
before we went on talking about as a kid growing up in Texarkana, age nine to 12 years old, that was when World War II was going on.

01:26.856 --> 01:33.764
Talk a little bit about how the war was viewed in Texarkana when you were in the what, sixth, seventh, eighth grade?

01:34.225 --> 01:34.886
About that time.

01:35.006 --> 01:35.246
Right.

01:35.647 --> 01:38.430
It was, everyone was very patriotic.

01:38.470 --> 01:43.496
Everyone was trying to do their share, do their part to help the war effort.

01:44.197 --> 01:45.359
We had the Victory Gardens.

01:45.459 --> 01:48.242
We had the tire rationing.

01:48.302 --> 01:49.063
We had the

01:49.617 --> 01:59.971
In school, we bought our 10 cents to buy the war bonds and collected the 10 and things like that to put what they needed to help in the war effort.

02:00.211 --> 02:12.347
I think I remember in my room, I kept a map of where the war was going on and I kept stick pins showing where the battles were taking place or where the front was expanding.

02:13.128 --> 02:18.115
At that time, my dad did not have to go.

02:18.315 --> 02:19.557
I would say he didn't have to go.

02:20.026 --> 02:21.508
would have gone had they called him.

02:22.269 --> 02:28.097
His job was driving a truck at Lone Star and Red River Ordnance.

02:28.177 --> 02:34.926
He delivered, picked up ammunition while they were producing it and took it to the igloos where they were stored.

02:35.587 --> 02:43.378
And, of course, one star spark and it might as well have been a war zone, you know.

02:43.398 --> 02:45.261
But it turned out okay.

02:45.281 --> 02:47.764
He did three years of doing that.

02:47.784 --> 02:49.206
It was a time that...

02:49.608 --> 02:50.770
Everybody pulled together.

02:50.790 --> 02:55.516
It was a time that the whole country was of the same mindset.

02:55.837 --> 02:57.739
Right, right, right, right.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.805
And there were jobs, civilian jobs, that were considered essential to the war effort.

03:01.825 --> 03:06.091
I know back then where the people who were in those jobs did not have to serve because of that.

03:06.111 --> 03:11.078
You said your dad was a little bit older than most of the 19, 20-year-olds that were going off to war.

03:11.138 --> 03:14.082
But you did have a couple of uncles who served, one in the Battle of the Bulge, right?

03:14.102 --> 03:14.483
That's true.

03:14.904 --> 03:19.530
And he was in combat in Europe.

03:19.747 --> 03:31.232
served, I mean, four or five, whatever time when the war was over, he came out and then went back and went to OCS and retired as a major years later.

03:31.252 --> 03:31.472
Right.

03:31.673 --> 03:34.078
But the other uncle, he served in England.

03:34.098 --> 03:38.768
I think he was in the supply corps and he kept the guys supplied what they needed over in Europe.

03:39.203 --> 03:45.371
Meanwhile, you were growing up on the Arkansas side of Texarkana, and at age 18, you went into the Air Force.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.152
That was in 1950.

03:46.232 --> 03:47.713
Sorry to talk about that.

03:48.014 --> 03:49.275
Okay, I did.

03:49.536 --> 03:53.981
And with Sen, of course, like everyone, you go to Lackland Air Force Base.

03:54.081 --> 04:01.150
There were a lot of guys at that time afraid they were going to get drafted, so a lot of them enlisted in the Air Force.

04:02.011 --> 04:04.254
And we had, I was there for 10 days.

04:04.294 --> 04:05.676
We had what we called Tent City.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.658
They didn't have enough room for us in barracks.

04:08.043 --> 04:13.190
So they moved a bunch of us up to Shepherd Air Force Base in Wichita Falls.

04:13.891 --> 04:15.513
And I finished my basic training there.

04:16.074 --> 04:25.767
And then from Shepherd, they took us to New Mexico Highlands University, who had a contract with the Air Force for A&E Mechanics and also a typewriter school.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.171
That's in what you had in mind, though, when you entered the Air Force, right?

04:29.191 --> 04:31.895
You didn't think you were going to be a wrench twister, right?

04:31.915 --> 04:32.596
Well, that's true.

04:33.297 --> 04:37.442
And, you know, the Air Force, they give you a battery test to see what you're suited for.

04:38.097 --> 04:40.220
But that's not what they go by.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.622
It's where they need you.

04:41.642 --> 04:45.087
And they picked up our whole squadron, sent us out to New Mexico.

04:45.809 --> 04:48.352
And I was there for 16 weeks in training.

04:48.993 --> 04:59.729
And then they sent us to Laughlin, I'm sorry, Chenute Air Force Base in Rantoul, Illinois, to finish specialized training on the engines we'd be working on.

05:00.751 --> 05:04.797
After five weeks there, we went to...

05:05.485 --> 05:10.232
I was sent to the Seward Air Force Base, Smyrna, Tennessee, which is right outside of Nashville.

05:11.013 --> 05:11.133
Right.

05:11.154 --> 05:12.816
We were in an engine buildup shop.

05:13.517 --> 05:15.160
We were building engines.

05:15.220 --> 05:30.282
They would come in in a big can, and we would take them out and hang them up and drain what was in them to preserve them, put spark plugs on them, put whatever it needed on them, and get them set up on the stand.

05:30.523 --> 05:34.108
And they were built for C-119s.

05:34.493 --> 05:38.179
which was a cargo type plane, which carried troops.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.686
And I was there for about six months.

05:43.648 --> 05:51.340
And during this time, we had people that were being taken out about every two weeks and to go to Korea.

05:51.661 --> 05:56.569
I had a friend of mine who worked in the orderly room and he came down one day and

05:57.038 --> 06:00.803
I said he needed somebody to volunteer to go overseas.

06:00.943 --> 06:05.049
And of course, my first question was, is it some place I might get shot at?

06:05.109 --> 06:07.172
And he said, it's probably not likely.

06:07.192 --> 06:09.215
And so, without thinking, I volunteered.

06:09.675 --> 06:11.998
And I wound up in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.924
Quite a ways from Inchon.

06:16.004 --> 06:17.005
Quite a ways.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.690
And of course, the main thing we fought over there was the temperature.

06:21.191 --> 06:26.438
And you can understand now, you hear what it's like over in Iran and that area, and it's anywhere from

06:26.722 --> 06:29.374
A cool night would be down in the 80s

06:30.080 --> 06:31.763
A bad day would be 110 to 125.

06:31.963 --> 06:32.383
Yeah.

06:32.403 --> 06:40.035
And we would get up early in the morning, do the work on the airplanes, and then go back to our barracks, which we did have air conditioning at that time.

06:40.055 --> 06:40.175
Right.

06:40.195 --> 06:45.703
So during the heat of the day, we could be inside if we didn't have something really essential that we had to do.

06:46.444 --> 06:46.544
Yeah.

06:46.565 --> 06:51.712
Well, it was either ice cold in Korea, where you'd be shot at, or the heat in Saudi Arabia.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.556
I guess of the two, you took the best.

06:54.616 --> 06:55.378
I took the best.

06:55.638 --> 06:56.579
It had air conditioning.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.023
Anyway.

06:59.003 --> 07:02.110
They needed the volunteers overseas.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.753
Talk about Saudi Arabia.

07:03.773 --> 07:08.082
This was, as we view Saudi Arabia now, we just like to think of flat, dust, and desert.

07:08.543 --> 07:10.989
Well, that was pretty much where I was.

07:11.209 --> 07:17.282
It was on the east side of Saudi Arabia, Dhahran.

07:17.819 --> 07:20.141
It was a lot of desert there.

07:20.181 --> 07:24.085
Now, Ramco had the Arabian American Oil Company had a big hangar there.

07:24.105 --> 07:25.766
They had more airplanes than we did, actually.

07:26.587 --> 07:29.710
And they had a compound that was about five miles north of us.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.691
And we could go up there.

07:31.531 --> 07:35.515
We were allowed to go up and go to the library and the restaurant and the theater that they had up there.

07:35.535 --> 07:37.116
So that made it a little nicer.

07:38.578 --> 07:45.784
The squadron that I joined was a detachment that was the 53rd Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron.

07:46.169 --> 07:49.593
known as hurricane hunters, and we can tell you more about those later.

07:51.315 --> 08:01.266
Our mission was to fly out of Dhahran north and then we'd turn east over across the top of Iran and fly south of Russia.

08:01.286 --> 08:02.347
They had four B-29s, right?

08:02.367 --> 08:04.689
They had four B-29s detachment there.

08:05.450 --> 08:16.142
After flying across there, I think what we did was a normal air weather mission, just taking air samples, temperatures, dew points, whatever they do,

08:16.493 --> 08:17.875
in those missions.

08:17.895 --> 08:25.608
And our primary purpose was there as a spy mission, which I found out 20 years later after I've been there.

08:26.148 --> 08:34.341
But I knew we had a big black tank that we carried in the bomb bay and it had a motor on it and it sucked air into the tank.

08:35.023 --> 08:42.214
So in December of 52, when I was there, they did have a nuclear test

08:42.734 --> 08:46.757
And we took the sample and it was sent to Washington.

08:49.340 --> 08:55.385
To take care of spare time while I was over there, I did get a part time job.

08:56.766 --> 09:01.990
I was in with special services and not like a special service fighting somebody.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.572
It was special services in radio.

09:04.893 --> 09:12.319
And I worked on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in spare time.

09:12.873 --> 09:17.320
at AFRD, which was the voice of the desert in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

09:17.340 --> 09:18.101
You were a disc jockey.

09:18.121 --> 09:19.423
A disc jockey is what it matters.

09:20.505 --> 09:24.611
We had, where you had programs now, you get them on tape and this sort of thing.

09:24.651 --> 09:29.759
We had big discs about this big around that we put on the turntable and it was a 30 minute program.

09:29.819 --> 09:36.349
We could hear Bob Hope and we could hear all these different programs that they would send over to us at that time.

09:36.329 --> 09:37.271
enjoyed hearing them.

09:38.032 --> 09:40.157
And also we had played some records in between.

09:40.297 --> 09:46.189
We had country and western music and other music.

09:46.890 --> 09:51.279
I had a friend that was back in the States would send me a letter each week telling me what the top ten were.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.882
And if we had that, we'd play open.

09:53.864 --> 09:56.329
So that took some of the time to

09:56.782 --> 09:57.684
take care of the border.

09:57.704 --> 09:59.829
So when the on-air light came on, what did you talk about?

09:59.849 --> 10:04.880
Did you talk about war news from Korea, news back in the United States, just anything you could come up with?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.343
Just anything you could come up with.

10:06.403 --> 10:10.312
If you had that information, where we were, we didn't get a lot of that information.

10:11.755 --> 10:16.866
But it was just enough to keep the guys entertained and something going on.

10:16.846 --> 10:18.169
Yeah, that's right.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.373
Give them the same old weather forecast, going to be hot tomorrow.

10:20.393 --> 10:24.080
Oh yeah, hot tomorrow, just like yesterday and the day coming.

10:24.100 --> 10:37.487
So anyway, in December, after we got the information that we needed from the test that we had, we picked up the four airplanes and we went back to our headquarters.

10:37.889 --> 10:41.975
At that time, headquarters was in Kinley Air Force Base, Bermuda.

10:41.995 --> 10:42.375
Yeah, that's tough.

10:42.395 --> 10:43.197
That was tough duty.

10:43.317 --> 10:43.697
I bet.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.018
Yes.

10:46.181 --> 10:47.182
The weather got nicer for you.

10:47.202 --> 10:54.873
The weather got much nicer, and the runway was right on the beach almost, and you could work on the airplane.

10:54.894 --> 10:57.537
If you get a little bit warm, you go down and take a swim, come back and finish your work.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.619
Yeah.

10:58.639 --> 10:59.540
It was nice there.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.483
It really was.

11:01.987 --> 11:17.456
And then I was there until September of 53, and we moved our headquarters again, and this time we went to Burtonwood, England, which is up between Manchester and Liverpool, which is well up there.

11:17.496 --> 11:24.049
And I got into the rain and the fog, so I've had all kinds of different weather that I've served in that four years I was there.

11:24.189 --> 11:24.670
That's right.

11:24.953 --> 11:30.623
But you decided about in 1954 that you didn't want to be a mechanic the rest of your life, so you took your discharge.

11:30.823 --> 11:40.940
I took discharge and came out of southern England, and we had a ship that we boarded, a troop ship, called the USS General Upshur.

11:41.201 --> 11:41.421
Right.

11:41.942 --> 11:50.657
And I spent about eight of the most miserable days of my life on that ship, and I knew I would never want in the Navy because I was

11:50.873 --> 11:52.095
Pretty sick coming across there.

11:52.135 --> 11:55.842
You'd been flown everywhere else, every other detail that you had.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.565
Every other assignment I went on here.

11:57.605 --> 12:00.370
When you went home, they put you on a boat, sent you into a storm.

12:00.490 --> 12:01.832
That's right.

12:01.852 --> 12:03.195
And you were eating a lot of soda crackers.

12:03.535 --> 12:04.257
A bunch.

12:04.277 --> 12:07.262
That's the only thing I existed on for that time.

12:07.782 --> 12:09.424
It's pretty tough.

12:10.145 --> 12:12.628
I want to go back to the mission out of Saudi Arabia.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.570
Talk just a little bit more about that.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.653
Now, you're a mechanic.

12:16.693 --> 12:19.776
You were keeping the planes in good order, keeping them in the air.

12:19.796 --> 12:21.899
B-29 is a complicated machine.

12:21.999 --> 12:28.727
Obviously, this is one of the most important aircraft of the World War II effort, also in Korea.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.070
The Enola Gay was a B-29.

12:30.270 --> 12:33.156
I mean, this is a big aircraft.

12:33.196 --> 12:35.300
Was it a complicated aircraft to keep in the air?

12:35.441 --> 12:36.563
It could be.

12:36.803 --> 12:42.415
We had a lot of problem with keeping spark plugs running in it, and it was just a big airplane.

12:42.555 --> 12:45.501
It took a lot of work and a lot of maintenance to keep them flying.

12:45.869 --> 12:49.913
In fact, there's only one in the world today that's still flying.

12:49.934 --> 12:50.514
Really?

12:50.534 --> 12:54.018
And that one is with the Commemorative Air Force out in Midland, Texas.

12:54.158 --> 12:54.459
I see.

12:54.839 --> 12:58.763
And yeah, they just finished putting engines on that thing and several million dollars.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.927
I don't know how the Air Force kept going broke just flying B-29s.

13:01.967 --> 13:06.692
They burn a lot of gas and it takes a lot of work on them.

13:07.113 --> 13:10.717
We had a regular, we had 16 aircraft in our squadron.

13:10.737 --> 13:13.800
So we had to set up regular work maintenance.

13:14.422 --> 13:17.265
and just rotate them as they needed work done on them.

13:17.285 --> 13:19.107
We'd rotate them through their maintenance work.

13:19.127 --> 13:20.148
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.168 --> 13:21.309
I hope those engines last a while.

13:21.329 --> 13:23.551
I don't know if four new engines will be in the new budget.

13:23.651 --> 13:23.952
I'm not sure.

13:23.972 --> 13:24.632
They don't think so.

13:26.374 --> 13:27.675
Exactly.

13:28.496 --> 13:41.509
Now, while we were in Bermuda, in, I believe it was in either August or September of 53, we had a hurricane evac, and the airplanes all came over to Columbia, South Carolina.

13:41.911 --> 13:54.144
At that time, I was in New York at the time that this took place, and when they deployed and went back, going back to Bermuda, one of the aircraft had an engine problem.

13:54.704 --> 13:58.948
The prop governor failed on it.

13:58.968 --> 14:04.714
The right outboard prop actually oversped, came loose, and hit the other engine.

14:04.834 --> 14:08.698
Of course, this was not a good situation.

14:08.738 --> 14:09.319
Right.

14:09.535 --> 14:11.958
I believe there were five people in the front of the airplane.

14:12.438 --> 14:14.321
One of them got out.

14:14.341 --> 14:16.423
There were six, I believe, in the rear.

14:16.644 --> 14:20.508
All of them got out, but one was not found afterwards.

14:20.528 --> 14:25.775
We don't know whether his chute failed or whether he just panicked or pulled under.

14:26.555 --> 14:30.440
And they floated around out in the Atlantic that night.

14:31.121 --> 14:36.167
And then the next day, an Exxon ship called Sea Train, Georgia,

14:36.518 --> 14:41.225
picked them up and took them back to.

14:41.285 --> 14:43.649
Fortunately for you, you were not on base at the time.

14:43.669 --> 14:45.532
You were in New York City, I believe you said.

14:45.732 --> 14:47.815
Had you been on base, you might likely have been on that plane.

14:47.835 --> 14:52.222
Yes, because one of the people that was on the plane was off the crew of the airplane that I worked on.

14:52.242 --> 14:52.542
I see.

14:53.003 --> 14:58.932
It just happened to be that he was the one that was picked, and had I been there, I could have easily been the one that was picked to be on it.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.419
So the good Lord was looking after me on that trip.

15:01.439 --> 15:02.040
Indeed, indeed.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.907
So after a four-year hitch, I guess, you were from 50 to 54?

15:06.107 --> 15:06.327
Right.

15:06.388 --> 15:10.535
Got out in 54, September 54.

15:12.178 --> 15:18.068
Went to college in Texarkana.

15:18.605 --> 15:20.590
Was it back to Texas County Junior College?

15:20.610 --> 15:20.931
Yes.

15:21.171 --> 15:25.622
You had gone, so you went back to school, because you had taken a semester there before you went in, right?

15:25.643 --> 15:26.304
That's correct.

15:26.685 --> 15:35.888
And so I went back and took some more, and again, working part-time in radio at two of the stations there, KOSY.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.300
KTFS.

15:37.320 --> 15:37.841
Right.

15:37.861 --> 15:38.462
In Texarkana.

15:38.482 --> 15:39.102
In Texarkana.

15:39.122 --> 15:50.776
And then went from there to Hope, Arkansas and worked at KXAR for about six months and then decided the radio wasn't the thing I wanted to be in, so I applied.

15:51.196 --> 15:53.019
You're telling me you can't get rich on radio.

15:53.039 --> 15:53.860
Yeah, right.

15:53.880 --> 15:54.320
I knew that.

15:54.821 --> 16:02.770
The salesman and the owners get rich and the poor guy behind the mic is the one that's doing the work.

16:03.644 --> 16:07.789
Anyway, I got a job with Eastern Airlines in Atlanta, Georgia.

16:07.809 --> 16:16.099
I was there for two years and then transferred after I got married while I was there and transferred to Memphis, Tennessee, which was my wife at the time.

16:16.159 --> 16:16.700
It was her home.

16:17.621 --> 16:18.282
It was about 1958.

16:18.482 --> 16:19.964
That was 58, right.

16:20.945 --> 16:27.373
And then in 1963, I got a job with the FAA

16:27.843 --> 16:54.019
in air traffic control. Air traffic control. I want to come back to that a minute because that's an interesting story about what that led to also. We've got just a few pictures here that I want to show that you've given to us to show but with the B-29, and then there there is a B-29 now talk about Specifically this one that attachment that's on the top of the plane. That one was where they took air samples in the top and they collected them and

16:54.742 --> 17:01.997
What the main purpose was, well, of course, we did that in Saudi Arabia when they took the air samples, when they dropped the nuclear test.

17:02.037 --> 17:02.618
We got that.

17:03.379 --> 17:09.972
But there is a function that they use that for, and I'm not really sure at this point what the air weather people did with it.

17:10.574 --> 17:14.742
But anyway, we had 16 of those aircraft.

17:15.262 --> 17:20.031
This is a publicity photo.

17:20.051 --> 17:23.958
You're not in this picture, but this is a publicity photo of a mechanics crew, right?

17:23.978 --> 17:38.265
Yes, this picture, I understand, was taken in 1945 and just giving the mechanics a little bit of publicity and a little bit of what they need to show what their job was really important to the people to keep those things in the air.

17:38.887 --> 17:41.994
That's great photography if that was truly, you know.

17:42.014 --> 17:46.684
Now this, we're going to jump ahead a little bit in our story and you're going to tell us more about that later.

17:47.686 --> 17:53.017
But right now you talked about the Confederate Air Force, which is now called the Commemorative Air Force.

17:53.759 --> 17:55.944
And you're a member of that.

17:55.964 --> 17:56.625
You used to

17:57.061 --> 17:57.321
Yes.

17:57.441 --> 17:58.463
Be a commander of that, right?

17:58.663 --> 17:59.724
Last year I was commander of this.

17:59.744 --> 18:00.845
Last year you were commander of that.

18:00.866 --> 18:01.967
They're based out of Georgetown.

18:02.007 --> 18:03.288
And this is your all's plane.

18:03.308 --> 18:03.869
It's a B-25.

18:03.969 --> 18:04.690
Right.

18:04.930 --> 18:10.397
Actually, it represents a Marine squadron, VMB 612, which served in the South Pacific.

18:11.258 --> 18:18.126
And we maintain and keep that airplane flying.

18:18.486 --> 18:25.735
And in fact, in this coming June the 9th, when Coulter Field has their air show, they're having an open house,

18:25.968 --> 18:31.437
We plan to have it here at that air show so everybody can see it and get a look at what those airplanes look like.

18:32.499 --> 18:38.809
And you do, as a member of the commemorative Air Force, you still do work on that.

18:38.850 --> 18:40.152
You still turn a wrench on that, right?

18:40.172 --> 18:45.300
Still turn a wrench, still working on it, and fly to air shows on it, which I'll be going to one next week in Brownsville.

18:45.461 --> 18:46.322
Right, right.

18:46.623 --> 18:57.147
In 1963, and you touched on this, you got a job as an air traffic control in Memphis, and you were there for 19 years before you went to Houston.

18:57.588 --> 18:58.390
No, I was there 10 years.

18:58.410 --> 18:59.231
10 years, excuse me.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.459
Yeah, that's 10 years before you went to Houston for eight and a half years.

19:02.659 --> 19:03.501
Right.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.974
Talk about that, air traffic control.

19:06.034 --> 19:08.036
People think about that job.

19:08.676 --> 19:12.439
It's considered one of the high-stress jobs that there is out there.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.021
Did you find it that way?

19:15.602 --> 19:20.486
Probably, like in radio, you can have a high-stress time and you can have where everything goes smooth.

19:21.007 --> 19:22.829
We had those kind of days.

19:22.949 --> 19:25.671
We'd have days where traffic was smooth and was light.

19:26.171 --> 19:29.454
Our biggest days was usually on Friday and Sunday.

19:29.594 --> 19:33.758
Fridays, you had the military going cross-country, you had the

19:34.160 --> 19:39.986
Corporate people are coming home for the weekend, and then you have your regular air carriers that are flying all the time.

19:40.246 --> 19:40.487
Right.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.168
And then on Sunday, it was just reverse.

19:42.529 --> 19:42.829
Right.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.511
The military was coming back to their base.

19:44.591 --> 19:51.118
The corporates were getting ready to go work, and you had your private aircraft in there, too.

19:51.218 --> 19:52.399
So you were working all of them.

19:52.659 --> 19:52.919
Yeah.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.441
You were in Memphis.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.702
Was FedEx in business then?

19:55.822 --> 19:58.605
They were just getting ready to go in business when I left there.

19:58.766 --> 19:59.046
I see.

19:59.586 --> 20:03.070
So I didn't get into that, but I understand that a friend of mine that worked there

20:03.522 --> 20:06.986
said at midnight it was the busiest airport in the country.

20:07.146 --> 20:10.770
All of them coming in at one place and all of them leaving during that time.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.992
And about four hours were just a real busy time.

20:13.132 --> 20:21.962
Yeah, because when they first started up until just a few years ago, and I think they do it a little bit differently now, that if you send a package to your next door neighbor, that package went to Memphis first and then came back.

20:21.982 --> 20:23.063
And it came back.

20:23.083 --> 20:23.684
That's true.

20:23.704 --> 20:24.205
Right, right.

20:24.645 --> 20:28.970
I think they've got hubs now to where everything doesn't go to Memphis, but I remember that.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.292
So then you went to Houston, same job.

20:31.633 --> 20:31.993
Right.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.134
for eight and a half years.

20:33.154 --> 20:34.275
Eight and a half years.

20:35.297 --> 20:37.599
There were some interesting things going on there at Houston.

20:37.619 --> 20:39.521
I worked in an area down in the southwest.

20:39.561 --> 21:01.525
I worked in Brownsville, Laredo, that area, and I worked aircraft out of Laredo Air Force Base, and it was not unusual to have a launch of a U-2 out of there, and he'd go up, he'd go off your frequency, and you wouldn't hear from him for another 10 or 12 hours, and he'd come back in wanting clearance to land, and you don't know where he'd been,

21:01.910 --> 21:04.332
what he was doing, you can speculate, but you know how that goes.

21:04.392 --> 21:05.253
Yeah, right.

21:05.273 --> 21:18.925
And another interesting thing was that the SR-71, which was a spy plane, and nobody was supposed to know about it and see about it.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.387
And I did get to work a few of those.

21:20.607 --> 21:20.987
I see.

21:21.007 --> 21:23.610
They would come out of somewhere, some altitude.

21:23.630 --> 21:27.553
We could tell if they tell us a certain code word, we could tell how high they were.

21:28.414 --> 21:31.697
And they would come down, they would do a refueling.

21:31.964 --> 21:53.871
they would have a refueling track and then meet up with a C-135 refueler and between 24 and 25,000 feet and they'd go on that racetrack and refuel and then they'd cut loose from their fueler and then they'd go back to wherever they were doing and whatever they were doing and I have tracked them

21:54.188 --> 21:58.434
Of course, this is slow for them at 1,700 miles an hour across our radar scope.

21:58.614 --> 22:00.777
And it was very interesting to talk to him.

22:00.957 --> 22:05.683
You put him on one center frequency, and he flew the whole center frequency.

22:07.726 --> 22:12.412
If he was changing the frequency every time he went to a new sector, that's all he could do, changing the frequency.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.194
He'd go through so fast.

22:14.495 --> 22:17.799
But it was interesting, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

22:18.360 --> 22:22.305
Until it ended, in 1981, and a lot of people, of course, know you were one of the

22:22.927 --> 22:25.511
12,000 who were fired by President Reagan.

22:25.531 --> 22:25.911
That's true.

22:26.051 --> 22:29.836
Not too many people can make a statement that when you get fired, you go all to the top.

22:29.876 --> 22:30.297
That's right.

22:30.497 --> 22:31.979
Fired by the president.

22:32.119 --> 22:34.403
It was a lose-lose situation.

22:35.344 --> 22:40.611
If you did go out, we weren't sure we were going to get fired, but we did.

22:41.532 --> 22:52.427
If you stayed in and the others that did go out and then the strike had been settled, then you're sitting there working with the guys that had gone out and with the type of job, that

22:52.627 --> 22:55.132
kind, you can really make it unpleasant for somebody.

22:55.333 --> 23:02.869
So I was able to get into criminal justice and got into adult probation in Montgomery County.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.737
And I worked there until 94, which I retired from there.

23:07.619 --> 23:09.322
And I didn't retire.

23:09.342 --> 23:10.385
I retired from that job.

23:10.445 --> 23:11.547
I didn't retire.

23:11.881 --> 23:19.275
After that, I was managing some apartments for about four years, and then about 18 months in Mexico, and then moved up to, came back to Mexico.

23:19.415 --> 23:20.377
My daughter lives here.

23:20.978 --> 23:24.264
In fact, she works with the 12-man foundation here on campus.

23:24.284 --> 23:25.607
And I moved in with her.

23:25.667 --> 23:28.793
I had been single for some time.

23:30.359 --> 23:31.621
And you found new life.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.083
I found new life, sure did.

23:33.243 --> 23:33.944
Yes, with a new person.

23:34.265 --> 23:35.086
That's right, that's right.

23:35.106 --> 23:38.491
Talk about that, because you were attending your aunt's 89th birthday program, right?

23:38.511 --> 23:39.693
Right, out at Curtin.

23:39.713 --> 23:40.514
She lived at Curtin.

23:40.875 --> 23:45.101
And I went to her 89th birthday and met my wife to be there.

23:45.782 --> 23:49.627
And our first date was an air show in Georgetown, Texas.

23:49.648 --> 23:49.988
Of course it was.

23:49.968 --> 23:51.029
Did she want to go?

23:51.210 --> 23:51.951
Oh, yeah.

23:51.971 --> 23:52.151
Oh, yeah.

23:52.171 --> 23:55.636
In fact, she's a member of the community of Air Force now.

23:56.577 --> 24:01.124
But it's been a good life since then.

24:02.105 --> 24:05.510
Unfortunately, my aunt passed away in November of last year at age 99.

24:05.690 --> 24:06.371
Wonderful life.

24:06.391 --> 24:07.312
And had a wonderful life.

24:07.493 --> 24:07.953
Sure did.

24:08.113 --> 24:08.935
Sure did.

24:09.095 --> 24:12.139
In the meantime, I've gotten involved in a few things here in the community.

24:12.720 --> 24:12.820
Yeah.

24:13.340 --> 24:15.644
I am on the City Council Curtin.

24:16.787 --> 24:34.601
I'm a member of the Brazos Valley Veterans Memorial Executive Board, Crime Stoppers Executive Board, and very involved with American Legion, which is a great organization for some of these new guys that are coming back from overseas getting their discharges or that are here that can get into it.

24:34.621 --> 24:36.124
There's a lot of benefits for the veterans

24:36.560 --> 24:37.942
that we can help them with.

24:39.423 --> 24:43.668
We have a service officer that helps them fill out paperwork and other things they need.

24:43.748 --> 24:54.020
So we'd highly recommend them get involved and also invite them to our 8 o'clock Thursday morning coffee every week from 8 to 10 and get to meet a lot.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.222
They don't have to be a veteran to be there.

24:55.242 --> 24:58.045
I mean, they don't have to be a member of the American Legion to be there.

24:58.582 --> 25:00.505
Just sit around and tell stories.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.270
As a matter of fact, that's where I met you a couple of weeks ago.

25:03.310 --> 25:03.671
That's right.

25:03.711 --> 25:08.439
We arranged this interview at that Thursday morning breakfast over at the American Legion.

25:08.459 --> 25:10.102
Well, that's great that you stay involved.

25:10.122 --> 25:14.009
And your wife, Kathy, is a member of the Auxiliary of the American Legion.

25:14.029 --> 25:14.210
She is.

25:14.791 --> 25:18.597
And she stays very, very involved, too.

25:18.617 --> 25:18.998
She does.

25:19.519 --> 25:20.100
Right, right.

25:20.080 --> 25:28.433
So when you look back at your experience, again, you weren't a combat veteran, but certainly you served a very essential need, and you've got to feel that way.

25:28.453 --> 25:29.054
I do.

25:29.074 --> 25:30.116
I do.

25:30.136 --> 25:37.808
And the squadron I was in, the 53rd Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, as I say, was known as the Hurricane Hunters.

25:38.409 --> 25:43.357
They are now stationed in Keesner Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.

25:44.359 --> 25:45.941
And they're still doing the same type of work.

25:46.402 --> 25:47.083
Right.

25:47.333 --> 25:54.243
We did fly a different kind of profile in the hurricanes.

25:54.263 --> 25:58.569
I understand the way they fly, they fly into it and kind of make an X and go back across it.

25:58.589 --> 26:09.865
The B-29, we got on the outside of the hurricane, the same rotation that it was going and just moved in closer and closer to the middle and we got into the eye of the hurricane.

26:10.030 --> 26:16.929
And at that point, the eye might be 20 miles across, you know, so then they would climb out and go out the top of it, but they wouldn't have to go through that again.

26:18.012 --> 26:19.276
And they fly C-130s, right?

26:19.537 --> 26:21.101
C-130s now, yes.

26:21.743 --> 26:23.167
Which is turboprops.

26:23.187 --> 26:24.611
The turboprops.

26:24.631 --> 26:25.373
That's right.

26:25.353 --> 26:26.474
You play golf or anything?

26:27.496 --> 26:33.182
No, I guess my hobby mostly is with the community of Air Force and American Legion involved with that sort of thing.

26:33.202 --> 26:40.151
Right, and you said in June, out of Coulter, there's going to be... There is an open house, and everyone is invited to come out.

26:40.171 --> 26:43.515
They're making some great plans.

26:43.535 --> 26:49.221
I'm kind of working with them since I live here and getting the B-25 over here.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.305
And they're going to have some...

26:53.365 --> 27:02.152
other military aircraft that will be coming in, replicas, and also we're trying to get some helicopters from, say, from Conroe or from Fort Hood to be here.

27:02.594 --> 27:03.035
Right.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.603
That's June of 2011, I want to tell folks that

27:05.853 --> 27:07.115
Uh-huh, June the 9th.

27:07.235 --> 27:12.783
Yeah, June the 9th of 2011, because you may be watching this show as a new show or a little bit later on.

27:12.843 --> 27:15.166
So that'll be coming up at Colter Field.

27:15.186 --> 27:17.630
Thank you very much for your service, and thanks for being our guest.

27:17.650 --> 27:18.311
It's my pleasure.

27:18.331 --> 27:19.913
I appreciate it, Bill.

27:19.933 --> 27:29.547
Besides turning wrenches on the B-29s, Bill Adams is active with the American Legion, Earl Graham Post, and Brian, where his wife, Kathy, is a member of the Auxiliary there.

27:29.567 --> 27:35.235
And we thank him and we salute him for his service, not only on American soil, but the far reaches of the globe.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.717
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:36.737 --> 27:39.592
Be sure and join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:39.592 --> 27:45.000
[Silence.]

27:45.000 --> 27:55.000
[Music.]

27:55.000 -> 28:05.000
[Music.]

28:05.000 --> 28:15.000
[Music.]
