00:07.034 --> 00:25.684
you

00:34.237 --> 00:36.280
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.303
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:38.323 --> 00:43.190
He's A&M class of 1969, head Yale leader his senior year, then U.S.

00:43.351 --> 00:47.417
Army Transportation Specialist in Vietnam in 1971 and 1972.

00:48.679 --> 00:59.535
Bill Youngkin is a distinguished attorney in the Brazos Valley, but today he's here not just because of his service as a Vietnam vet, but because he shares my passion for telling stories of the greatest generations.

01:00.275 --> 01:11.658
For more than a year now, Bill Youngkin has been writing the stories of Brazos Valley World War II veterans as part of a weekly series appearing each Sunday in the Bryan College Station Eagle, Brazos Valley Heroes.

01:11.678 --> 01:14.925
Bill and I share the honored privilege of knowing these brave men and women

01:15.310 --> 01:17.153
and hearing their stories firsthand.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.637
Bill Youngkin, thanks for being with me.

01:19.657 --> 01:24.244
We do share this uncommon passion for giving credit to World War II veterans.

01:24.304 --> 01:26.928
But first, I want you to talk about your service in Vietnam.

01:26.968 --> 01:32.417
After you got out of Texas A&M, 71 and 72, what was your job as a transportation specialist?

01:32.677 --> 01:41.571
Well, basically I was assigned to the I-Corps area and we were supportive of the 101st Airborne Division.

01:42.074 --> 02:04.268
and the A of the 4th Artillery had all these fire bases up along the Laotian border and DMZ and my job was basically to keep us going with powder and projectile and whatever else was needed and they'd bring it as far north as I could and then I'd make sure I'd lug it around to various fire bases and so spent my time pretty close to the DMZ.

02:04.687 --> 02:06.950
You did a lot of your work, I believe, at nighttime.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.052
It's kind of hard to stay quiet at that time, wasn't it?

02:09.112 --> 02:10.374
Well, not a lot of it at nighttime.

02:10.394 --> 02:20.285
There were occasional ones at nighttime, but it's hard to be quiet when you're traveling down the old trail, so to speak, going from one place to the other.

02:20.325 --> 02:22.548
They know when you're coming and they know when you're going.

02:22.568 --> 02:26.873
And so, yeah, there wasn't any way to be quiet when you're doing that, that's for sure.

02:28.254 --> 02:31.538
But occasionally we have a night deal, but most of the time it was during the daytime.

02:32.092 --> 02:37.999
I know there's a lot of stories from that year in Vietnam, but one story that you told me earlier in particular was Christmas of 1971.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.742
Talk about that.

02:40.262 --> 02:44.427
Well, it was the first Christmas that I was going to spend away from my family.

02:44.447 --> 02:47.351
I grew up in Gilmore, Texas, born and raised there.

02:48.513 --> 02:55.281
And Christmas Eve had approached, and I was starting to feel a little low and blue about not being able to be home.

02:55.902 --> 03:03.609
We got word that Bob Hope was gonna make an unexpected stop for his USO Christmas tour.

03:04.290 --> 03:08.874
And we're gonna have it at Camp Eagle, which is the headquarters of 101st Division there.

03:10.135 --> 03:13.098
And so we kind of got to draw straws about who got to go.

03:13.358 --> 03:23.968
And off my fire base, I was able to, me and my platoon, my platoon and I were able to draw the lucky straw, so to speak, and were able to go.

03:24.539 --> 03:33.967
went over and the stage was basically two trailers pulled together at the base of a hill.

03:34.888 --> 03:36.649
And if you're an officer, you have to be at the back.

03:36.669 --> 03:38.271
If you're an enlisted, you have to be next to the stage.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.973
So I was a first lieutenant, so I was very back of the back.

03:41.874 --> 03:49.840
And I couldn't see too good, so I pulled my gun truck that we used for these convoys, pulled it up, and I'm sitting on the hood.

03:49.860 --> 03:54.124
And the show starts about that time, and I'm watching the show.

03:54.307 --> 03:56.870
And somebody walks by, and I said, howdy, hey.

03:57.471 --> 04:02.837
I looked down, and it was a classmate of mine that I'd gone to A&M with named Bill Wilkerson, who was in the band.

04:03.538 --> 04:09.986
I jumped down, and we shake hands, a glad hand, and then up comes another and another and another.

04:10.807 --> 04:15.693
And all together, there were six classmates that showed up there and two other guys who were class ahead of us.

04:16.414 --> 04:18.436
We didn't know anybody was anywhere around.

04:18.536 --> 04:20.078
We had not run across each other at all.

04:20.682 --> 04:25.827
And so we not only had shared some time together, we got shared at Christmas time.

04:25.887 --> 04:32.372
So what started out to be one of what I thought was going to be one of my worst Christmases ended up being one of my best Christmas memories.

04:32.773 --> 04:39.158
And I think that's why service people thought so much of Mr. Hope.

04:39.178 --> 04:44.963
And his passing is a loss to the whole country, but particularly to those who served.

04:45.204 --> 04:46.485
He lived a wonderful long life.

04:46.505 --> 04:47.686
Do you remember much about the show?

04:48.066 --> 04:49.187
Oh, I do.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.446
Vita Blue was the athlete.

04:52.147 --> 04:52.668
Jill St.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.073
John was the female star.

04:55.373 --> 04:58.399
I fell in love with her then and remained in love with her since.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.165
It was just a wonderful thing.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.611
He brought home to you that Christmas day.

05:05.631 --> 05:07.154
It was just special.

05:07.375 --> 05:07.956
It really was.

05:08.577 --> 05:10.400
It was one of the better days I've spent.

05:10.801 --> 05:12.904
Best day I've spent in Vietnam, I'll tell you that for sure.

05:12.964 --> 05:13.285
Indeed.

05:13.568 --> 05:14.751
Let's wind it back, 1965.

05:15.774 --> 05:19.544
You came from Gilmer, Texas to the big school, Texas A&M.

05:20.025 --> 05:23.815
1965 was a significant year for Texas A&M, your freshman year.

05:24.116 --> 05:24.857
Yes, it was.

05:24.878 --> 05:29.670
It was the first year that women were openly made on the campus.

05:30.157 --> 05:32.921
and it was the first year the Corps was not compulsory.

05:32.941 --> 05:40.331
I didn't tell you that, so you didn't know about that so much, but not like I would have known much anyhow coming out of Gilmer.

05:40.391 --> 05:42.754
But anyway, that was when I started.

05:42.774 --> 05:46.760
And when I started, A&M was pretty much the same place it had been since the 40s.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.984
There were about maybe 8,500 students total.

05:50.545 --> 05:54.911
But by the time I graduated, there was almost 13,000 students, so almost a 50% increase.

05:55.171 --> 05:56.473
So you were here when the boom started.

05:56.653 --> 05:59.657
I was here when the boom started, and I had the great privilege of

06:00.245 --> 06:09.785
having my president being Earl Rutter and who is one of the greatest Aggies of all time and one of the greatest leaders that this university has ever had or ever will have.

06:10.406 --> 06:10.707
Indeed.

06:11.268 --> 06:13.292
You and I were talking not long ago about

06:13.812 --> 06:15.474
things that we have in common.

06:15.494 --> 06:20.081
You and I were at the same football game in 1967, I believe, in Lubbock, Texas.

06:20.101 --> 06:21.623
I was a student at Texas Tech.

06:21.643 --> 06:24.748
You were a student at Texas A&M in Lubbock.

06:24.828 --> 06:27.512
That was a very famous football game, I think.

06:27.532 --> 06:28.193
It was.

06:28.233 --> 06:36.305
It was one of the few trips I made to Lubbock that I truly enjoyed when Ed Hargett scored the winning touchdown with no time left on the clock.

06:36.325 --> 06:42.874
It was a special day for us because we went on from there and won every game and thereafter went to the

06:43.445 --> 06:45.527
Went to the Cotton Bowl and beat Alabama in the Cotton Bowl.

06:45.547 --> 06:50.934
It was truly a great year with a great team, and one will always be remembered.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.135
You and I were both in that stadium.

06:52.155 --> 06:59.384
You told a story about after the game that a young Aggie freshman was trying to get away with something, and you advised him not to.

06:59.404 --> 07:07.073
Well, we had some dates with some young ladies from Texas Tech, and we were going to go back and try to celebrate a little bit more.

07:07.593 --> 07:33.195
We were walking to our vehicle and of course we had uniforms on and here comes this freshman who had one of these tech bells in his hand and he was just booking and there were about 40 guys in red shirts and black pants right behind him and he sees us and he starts hollering, old army fight which was the signal to come help me if you're an Aggie and he runs over to us and those guys circle us and

07:33.614 --> 07:35.456
They told us we want our bell back.

07:35.536 --> 07:42.804
Apparently he had, well not apparently, he had stolen one of the hand bells that the saddle tramps used during the game for them to ring and stuff.

07:42.884 --> 07:48.370
And so I told the freshman, I said, you know, I think that guy really wants his bell.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.191
Why don't you go give it back to him?

07:50.211 --> 07:52.994
He said, sir, would you think it'd be a good bull if he took it back to A&M?

07:53.034 --> 07:56.358
I said, yeah, but I think they really want that bell, so give it back to him.

07:56.378 --> 07:59.301
And I know he probably went back and told his fish buddies what a,

07:59.703 --> 08:04.848
What a terrible upperclassman I probably was, because I didn't have the guts to try to bring that bell back.

08:04.868 --> 08:07.771
But I thought discretion was a little better decision that day.

08:07.971 --> 08:11.634
1969, your senior year, you're elected head Yale leader.

08:11.654 --> 08:16.299
That's a very small club, head Yale leaders at Texas A&M.

08:16.319 --> 08:17.359
I know you're proud to be one of them.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.481
Well, it is a small club.

08:18.561 --> 08:25.487
There are, as far as Yale leaders in period total, there's probably not more than 300 in the history of the university.

08:26.608 --> 08:28.630
There are about 205.

08:28.947 --> 08:29.788
Four to five.

08:30.028 --> 08:31.790
We lose three a year.

08:31.870 --> 08:32.991
We kind of gain three a year.

08:33.091 --> 08:36.134
So it's a pretty select little club and one I'm proud to be part of.

08:37.375 --> 08:42.160
Talk about what that year, what you remember most about your senior season.

08:42.841 --> 08:46.765
Oh, I remember the players on the team.

08:48.126 --> 08:50.028
Such really wonderful folks.

08:50.148 --> 08:53.271
Ed Hargett, Billy Hobbs, Tommy Maxwell.

08:54.893 --> 08:56.214
It just goes on and on.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.296
Just really good.

08:58.647 --> 09:01.111
athletes, but really good people.

09:02.212 --> 09:05.417
Guys have gone on and made a difference in their lives since.

09:06.118 --> 09:13.289
And people I am very proud of to have been a classmate of and to have been part of the athletic program at A&M.

09:13.309 --> 09:15.292
Guys you have in contact with still today?

09:15.312 --> 09:16.393
Absolutely, still do.

09:16.453 --> 09:26.308
As a matter of fact, this last year when Billy Hobbs, who was a classmate, All-American linebacker, passed away, went down to San Antonio with Ed Hargett, who was quarterback, to the funeral.

09:26.828 --> 09:28.951
And all the guys showed up.

09:28.972 --> 09:33.299
And I was just so proud to see them all, you know, that they showed up for Billy and stuff.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.584
It was heartwarming to see how close everybody's remained.

09:36.604 --> 09:36.864
Indeed.

09:37.165 --> 09:39.409
Got some photographs that you brought to share with us.

09:39.429 --> 09:40.771
I'd like to go to one of them right now.

09:40.811 --> 09:43.335
There's one that you're proud of.

09:43.838 --> 09:46.160
young cadet Bill Youngkin, head yell eater.

09:46.180 --> 09:46.961
Talk about that picture.

09:47.001 --> 09:50.884
That was a Tuesday night practice in front of Henderson Hall.

09:50.985 --> 09:52.726
The football team is good up behind.

09:53.086 --> 09:55.929
That's what we used to do on Tuesday and Thursday nights for away games.

09:55.969 --> 10:00.133
We'd have yell practice, and we'd occasionally go over and have one in front of the athletic dorm.

10:00.874 --> 10:04.977
And so I'm telling a fable, I think, at that point in time.

10:05.057 --> 10:13.525
And I can tell by the grins on the players behind that it was apparently funny or something because they're sure laughing.

10:16.002 --> 10:16.864
That's a great picture.

10:18.247 --> 10:22.738
The spirit back in 1969, it really hasn't changed very much from 69 to 2005.

10:23.380 --> 10:33.184
You know, I will tell you that I was here during a change from all male military to been around many years since and have two daughters have gone here.

10:33.957 --> 10:36.360
It's changed, but it hasn't changed.

10:36.461 --> 10:41.388
The essentials, the specialness, the uniqueness of this place has remained.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.911
The kids have ensured that that's the case.

10:43.971 --> 10:47.697
And that's really where the responsibility of all that kind of lies with the kids.

10:48.237 --> 10:51.642
And they have really, they have continued to be good eggs.

10:51.862 --> 10:59.694
And I am very proud of my university, but I'm really proud of what the kids have done to maintain it.

10:59.714 --> 11:01.416
Let's go to another picture of a

11:02.138 --> 11:03.439
young, uh, Bill Youngkin.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.824
Now you say that, that picture was a little bit staged somewhat after you finished today.

11:07.884 --> 11:08.164
Yeah.

11:08.185 --> 11:11.568
When I, when I graduated, I didn't have enough money to make that photograph.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.631
So this is, uh, this is about a week before I go to Vietnam.

11:14.772 --> 11:16.614
And my mom asked me to go have that picture done.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.555
And I, and I did that.

11:17.955 --> 11:20.238
And, uh, the other one you're holding is one.

11:20.558 --> 11:22.700
I was going to move that one right into the shot right now.

11:24.002 --> 11:27.005
Is me as a young first Lieutenant there in Vietnam.

11:27.385 --> 11:28.146
Um, I was,

11:28.784 --> 11:31.629
We were kind of all sitting around my hooch one night.

11:31.949 --> 11:49.179
It's a little place we all slept and stuff, and some of the guys that I lived with, we'd kind of gather around and visit, and somebody took that snapshot of me, and that's, most of my shots are on slides, so that's the only one I can really come up with today.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.762
Indeed, indeed.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.986
Great photographs, great photographs.

11:53.776 --> 12:02.106
One of the reasons that I invited you here today is to talk about the passion that you and I share for veterans and especially veterans here in the Brazos Valley.

12:02.126 --> 12:08.053
You told me the other day that it started back in 1992 when you took a visit to Washington, D.C.

12:08.073 --> 12:08.713
Talk about that.

12:09.154 --> 12:22.990
Well, you know, after I got back from Vietnam, Vietnam was such a time in our country that there were so many people that didn't appreciate what was going on and didn't appreciate what you'd done.

12:23.594 --> 12:27.299
And so I just, like a lot of us, I just went on with my life.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.705
I went on and got my law degree and started raising my family, started my business.

12:32.487 --> 12:33.828
And I just did that.

12:33.929 --> 12:38.515
I didn't think about my military career in the past.

12:38.535 --> 12:44.183
And I had the privilege of going to Washington for a meeting one summer with a former student association.

12:45.405 --> 12:47.728
And I went to the wall for the first time.

12:48.451 --> 12:58.062
And if you served during the Vietnam time period or if you grew up during that time period, there are people on that wall that you know and you know personally.

12:58.082 --> 13:02.367
And I went and you just, you really can't help but reach up and touch those names.

13:02.668 --> 13:09.355
And when I was there, when I was leaving, I made myself a promise that from that point on, I wouldn't go and forget the guys.

13:10.196 --> 13:12.179
And I've held true to that since.

13:12.199 --> 13:15.943
And I've become a lot more active as far as being a veteran,

13:16.514 --> 13:19.418
being involved with veteran activities, things of this nature.

13:20.439 --> 13:24.705
And mainly because I'm really not going to forget those guys.

13:24.845 --> 13:25.646
I never will.

13:25.666 --> 13:25.847
Right.

13:25.867 --> 13:31.594
I know you said that 11 of your classmates from your class, class of 69, were lost in Vietnam.

13:31.614 --> 13:34.899
And I guess that's, you said that that's the second most of any class.

13:35.099 --> 13:35.520
Is that right?

13:35.540 --> 13:36.080
That's correct.

13:36.381 --> 13:45.593
And we have a memorial right here just off the quadrangle between the Sanders Course Center and the quadrangle.

13:46.062 --> 13:51.710
All the 11 names are there and we have 11 crape myrtle trees parked around the benches there.

13:52.191 --> 13:58.661
And I go by at least on Memorial Day and Veterans Day every year and visit with the guys, if not more often than that.

13:58.681 --> 14:05.551
And one of them, we were on R&R together and we're coming back to Vietnam.

14:05.591 --> 14:07.534
He was a Special Forces guy.

14:08.656 --> 14:15.546
And I was talking about how much time we had left and we'd be back to Kyle Field and we'd see each other then.

14:16.471 --> 14:41.770
says no bill i'm not gonna i'm not gonna make it and i said oh don't tell me that and uh two weeks later i got the word that that he had been killed oh my and uh it was uh one of those tragedies but when we dedicated that memorial um his family all the families came and his brother who was younger than us uh came over and i was talking to him about steve's death and stuff and he said i want somebody you want you to meet and he brought over this

14:42.087 --> 14:45.532
good-looking, blond-haired, blue-eyed young man, about 14 years old.

14:46.193 --> 14:48.977
He said, I want you to meet my son, Steve, who was named after his brother.

14:49.437 --> 14:50.599
And he was just a spitting image.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.264
I mean, he said, his brother Mike said, he's kind of irrigating.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.728
I said, yeah, he really is.

14:58.110 --> 14:58.971
Incredible story.

14:58.991 --> 15:05.340
And then, so let's fast forward, and you get involved when they first start talking about doing a Brazos Valley Veterans Memorial.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.723
You get involved with that on the board, and

15:08.024 --> 15:15.335
It's reality now, as people can see from the introduction to our show, of course, pictures of that beautiful memorial out in College Station.

15:15.595 --> 15:16.516
I'm so proud of that.

15:16.917 --> 15:17.818
I really am.

15:17.959 --> 15:22.185
It's just turned out better than I ever thought, and it's just a beautiful place.

15:22.305 --> 15:23.727
If you've not been there, you need to go.

15:24.408 --> 15:28.815
If you have a family member's name on the memorial, it needs to be there.

15:28.995 --> 15:29.876
Just all there is to it.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.580
And I'm on the board, and...

15:33.218 --> 15:36.401
I'm very privileged to serve on that board.

15:36.441 --> 15:38.744
It's something I truly enjoy doing.

15:38.924 --> 15:42.227
I enjoy what we do, and I enjoy the people I'm doing it with.

15:42.427 --> 15:54.639
So the memorial exists, it's done, but as far as the board and the people that put it together, you come up with a suggestion to keep this thing going as far as recognizing veterans, and that's what the Eagle article is all about.

15:54.659 --> 15:58.163
Well, yes, and of course, we're going to keep developing the park.

15:58.203 --> 16:02.247
It's not finished at this point in time, and the thought was, well, what do we do to keep

16:02.564 --> 16:15.820
that need before the public, and one of the deals was to possibly do a story about our veterans, to let the people know that the guy next door to you is just not this old guy next door to you.

16:16.521 --> 16:20.646
At some point in time in his life, he did something that's kind of unique, and you need to know about it.

16:21.527 --> 16:25.052
And that not only did that for his country, but he's done things since.

16:25.372 --> 16:29.297
And so that was the purpose of the articles, to let folks know about their neighbor next door.

16:29.868 --> 16:35.599
And I think it's been accomplished because I have people come to me all the time and say, you know, I never knew that about so-and-so.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.328
And I say, yeah, I know you didn't, but aren't you glad you do now?

16:40.348 --> 16:41.170
And they are.

16:41.451 --> 16:43.495
And it's just been so well received.

16:43.615 --> 16:47.843
It's been something I've been blessed to be part of, to tell you the truth.

16:47.823 --> 16:50.548
And the Eagle, obviously, a very cooperative.

16:50.568 --> 16:52.191
Donnish Baggett said, go with it.

16:52.292 --> 16:55.738
And they give you a pretty goodly amount of space every Sunday.

16:55.999 --> 17:02.190
Let me tell you, Donnish and the Eagle have just been wonderful in their community service, and particularly this organization.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.479
That space that they give is a prime space in the sports page.

17:06.579 --> 17:06.779
Yes.

17:07.781 --> 17:09.304
That cost them a lot of money.

17:09.504 --> 17:09.865
Right.

17:09.845 --> 17:17.740
But they make that contribution to their community every week and I am ever so thankful and everybody else should be too.

17:17.780 --> 17:24.173
And I want to thank Donis again for him without question saying you bet we'd love to do that.

17:24.373 --> 17:26.337
You know the amazing thing is you do it in print.

17:26.597 --> 17:30.064
I have the privilege here at KAMU to do it on television.

17:30.382 --> 17:34.667
And approximately how many have been published so far?

17:34.948 --> 17:36.990
Well, we've done over a year.

17:37.250 --> 17:37.511
Right.

17:37.571 --> 17:38.852
So I know it's 50-plus.

17:38.932 --> 17:46.642
I've kind of lost Kemp, but I think we're in the mid to late 50s as far as the number of stories that have been published at this point in time.

17:46.822 --> 17:47.082
Right.

17:47.523 --> 17:57.655
I always try to have some to do ahead of time, and I try to do an interview once a month at the former student's building here and have it videoed.

17:57.803 --> 18:05.617
And then I will take those four interviews and write stories for a month and I'll do another set of interviews.

18:05.877 --> 18:06.959
So you've done close to 60.

18:06.979 --> 18:10.345
You're the 24th guest that I've had on Veterans of the Valley.

18:11.267 --> 18:14.833
So close to 90 between us veterans that we have highlighted.

18:15.151 --> 18:16.192
in our different mediums.

18:16.232 --> 18:23.261
And the amazing thing is of all those 90s, so we only have one common one that you've had in the newspaper that I've had on the show.

18:23.281 --> 18:25.704
That was Frank Coachman, and that's the only one.

18:25.744 --> 18:32.152
So that just gives you an idea of how many veterans that there are in this valley, just World War II.

18:32.252 --> 18:39.120
And of course, I expand to Vietnam and Desert Storm and also, but how many veterans and wonderful stories that there are here in the community.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.502
And there's still a whole lot more to tell.

18:41.042 --> 18:41.984
Oh, there's no question, Tommy.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.787
It's, to start with,

18:45.121 --> 18:51.150
I had some names of people I knew, but that was a little bit of reluctance because they didn't know what this was going to turn out to be.

18:52.212 --> 18:59.903
But since then, I think that people have recognized that there are people they know that need to have the story told.

18:59.923 --> 19:02.467
And I keep now a list of 20 to 30 people.

19:03.408 --> 19:06.933
And that's just the World War II guys.

19:06.973 --> 19:12.141
We're going to move on at some point in time, obviously, because World War II guys...

19:12.273 --> 19:15.397
not gonna be with us forever, but to Korea and Vietnam, as you're doing.

19:15.758 --> 19:21.646
But we're trying to do it like that because of the time constraints that we have with some of our folks.

19:21.666 --> 19:31.480
And no matter how hard you try to get around everybody, I've had a couple of interviews I had lined up with people that got sick and then passed away on me.

19:31.500 --> 19:36.147
So there's a real sense of urgency about doing that, particularly with the World War II guys.

19:36.427 --> 19:38.049
And so that's why we're doing them first.

19:38.330 --> 19:40.533
I think I've had 15 World War II veterans on the show.

19:40.573 --> 19:42.195
I've had...

19:42.395 --> 19:45.161
nine, I believe, Vietnam veterans and one from Desert Storm.

19:45.181 --> 19:46.323
But you're right.

19:46.343 --> 19:53.858
There is a sense of urgency with the World War II veterans and telling their story because the numbers that we hear are that we're losing them at a thousand a day.

19:53.878 --> 19:55.622
And so their stories need to be told.

19:55.642 --> 19:57.085
They need to be told the right way.

19:57.185 --> 19:58.227
And that means them telling them.

19:58.915 --> 20:01.940
And one that's kind of get overlooked a lot of times, the Korean veterans.

20:01.980 --> 20:04.664
They're not very far behind the World War II veterans.

20:05.566 --> 20:09.873
And so we're gonna have to sometime here pretty quick start catching some of those.

20:09.893 --> 20:11.015
We're gonna miss those stories.

20:11.255 --> 20:16.283
There's a gentleman named Bob Middleton, who I'm gonna have on the show next week, who's a Korean War veteran, as a matter of fact.

20:16.938 --> 20:24.992
One thing that you do and that I do is, and really which is the most pleasurable personally for us in what we're doing is actually sitting down and hearing these stories.

20:25.714 --> 20:29.180
You interview them, for the most part, you interview them four at a time.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.965
You get together over the former students and interview them four at a time.

20:32.025 --> 20:36.112
So you're hearing a story and three other veterans are hearing the same story.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.556
Talk about how that works.

20:38.576 --> 20:41.241
You know, I thought that

20:41.761 --> 20:54.113
that might work as a format because, you know, like when I go to VFW, you can sit around with the guys and kind of have these conversations, and somebody will tell a story and kind of remind somebody of something else, and they kind of open up and start talking.

20:54.934 --> 20:59.378
So I thought maybe the best way to do that would be with more than one present.

20:59.398 --> 21:08.747
And it's a very nice environment, the Ring Library Room, and it's kind of just close in and just the guys.

21:08.812 --> 21:09.533
And they really do.

21:09.593 --> 21:17.545
I mean, it's been a very good method to do the interviews because everyone is interested in the other stories, too.

21:18.466 --> 21:33.107
And when you get through, and it's usually about a three-hour deal by the time you get through with the interviews, and you just shake your head and say, how blessed was I to be here today and to listen to and be part of these lives and those events.

21:33.207 --> 21:37.333
It's been such a gratifying experience for me.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.785
I can't wait to do the next set of interviews.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.991
And I hope that I do justice to the stories.

21:45.832 --> 21:48.957
And I tell folks, all I do is repeat what they've told me.

21:50.038 --> 21:52.562
I don't put any spin to it or anything else.

21:52.622 --> 21:56.508
I just try to put it in a manageable format, basically.

21:56.528 --> 21:58.671
But it's their story.

21:58.691 --> 22:00.053
And it's the personal story, too.

22:00.794 --> 22:02.376
The first thing we talk about is

22:02.761 --> 22:06.086
It's not about the war and where it was fought and when and how.

22:06.486 --> 22:07.007
We know that.

22:07.568 --> 22:08.850
It's about your experiences.

22:09.891 --> 22:13.276
What happened to you, who you were with, what you saw, what you heard, what you did.

22:14.137 --> 22:17.362
And each one of them is unique, just as all people are unique.

22:17.442 --> 22:22.550
And it's been every story is different from the other because the people are different.

22:23.471 --> 22:26.435
And it's just been the most gratifying thing that I've been involved with.

22:26.936 --> 22:29.680
And it's been an honor and a privilege for me to get to know these men.

22:30.166 --> 22:33.069
The product that you produce is that two columns in the newspaper.

22:33.109 --> 22:37.474
The product that I produce is this 30 minutes on television under the lights.

22:37.534 --> 22:44.722
And that unfortunately might not be the right word, but unfortunately the viewer or the reader, that's all they get to see.

22:44.742 --> 22:52.530
Wouldn't it be wonderful if the viewer or the reader could sit down with us in that two or that three hours that we talk to our subjects.

22:52.550 --> 22:54.132
What I do here on Veterans of the Valley,

22:54.567 --> 23:05.665
Every person that is in that chair, I have gone to their home or to their place of business two days before and sat down with a tape recorder so I don't have to take notes.

23:05.705 --> 23:09.772
I could just sit back and talk to them and hear their story.

23:10.453 --> 23:14.719
And I would have talked to them for anywhere from an hour to three hours.

23:14.740 --> 23:15.681
And somehow,

23:16.184 --> 23:26.438
If only you had more space, if only I had more time, because what we can't tell in that column or what we can't tell in this 30 minutes is just incredible.

23:26.478 --> 23:33.527
We try to hit the highlights, we try to hit the best of, but they're personal stories and stories that we just don't have time for to have space for.

23:33.807 --> 23:34.949
That's really the incredible part.

23:34.969 --> 23:39.995
That's the main drawback I see is I just can't tell everything that I've heard.

23:40.396 --> 23:41.057
Right.

23:41.618 --> 23:45.803
And I just try, as you say, hit some of the higher spots that are there.

23:46.205 --> 23:52.575
But, and some of them, there have been two or three now that I just, I couldn't put it in one article.

23:52.715 --> 23:57.522
I mean, I had to do two stories because their stories were so involved.

23:59.124 --> 24:09.319
And so I've had to do that on at least three occasions now, but for the most part, the toughest job is to limit the story to the space that you need to try to limit to.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.364
And thank goodness that Donis and Em,

24:12.766 --> 24:19.203
increase the space and made the size of the print smaller and they're doing everything they can to try to accommodate me in that regard.

24:20.526 --> 24:25.138
The Eagle deserves a lot of kudos for what they're doing.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.814
They're doing everything they can to put that article out there.

24:27.974 --> 24:29.637
Well, we have a lot of great media in this town.

24:29.657 --> 24:38.033
Of course, the Bryan College Station Eagle is one and KAMU Television is another that gives us the time and the space to do that.

24:38.053 --> 24:39.936
I know it's hard to pick out a favorite.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.338
It's like picking out a favorite child.

24:41.819 --> 24:46.688
But some of the stories that really just had you sitting there just in awe

24:47.242 --> 24:48.585
Can you think of one or two?

24:48.605 --> 24:49.949
Oh, I can.

24:49.969 --> 24:53.517
I can think of several, to tell you the truth.

24:53.537 --> 24:54.279
We got three minutes.

24:55.502 --> 24:58.028
You know, some are...

24:58.075 --> 25:01.899
They're kind of lighthearted and entertaining.

25:01.919 --> 25:06.584
And some are just, I mean, they're straight to the heart.

25:07.665 --> 25:19.336
And they're kind of hard to move out of your mind sometimes because they get very honest and upfront about some of those experiences and stuff.

25:19.356 --> 25:23.581
But there are two or three that just stick out in my mind and always will.

25:23.861 --> 25:28.065
But every time I go to those interviews,

25:28.349 --> 25:34.056
Every one of them is compelling, but some just stick out of your mind, as you say, more than others.

25:35.038 --> 25:43.709
But there are, I remember one gentleman who was at Pearl Harbor the day the Japanese struck.

25:44.269 --> 25:49.256
He had just graduated from basic training the day before.

25:50.417 --> 25:58.187
Decided to sleep in that Sunday morning, didn't go to chow, and the bomb hit the mess hall and killed most of his friends.

25:58.893 --> 26:09.407
And he was there from the very start to the very end, the New Guinea campaign, which is just terrible, terrible terrain to fight him.

26:09.427 --> 26:17.558
And I remember him talking about those experiences and kind of a quiet gentleman, but tears started coming down his eyes.

26:18.239 --> 26:22.385
And he said, New Guinea, that's where I lost my fear.

26:23.186 --> 26:26.470
And you know, there was no question that

26:27.142 --> 26:32.009
That terrible place and that terrible time, he overcame that.

26:32.610 --> 26:37.677
And from that point on, he was a soldier through and through.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.222
They're life-changing experiences.

26:41.242 --> 26:47.711
There are people that, their experiences in the war and their experiences after have just been amazing.

26:48.392 --> 26:52.137
I think of a gentleman who was a soldier.

26:52.994 --> 26:57.618
within the Army Air Corps and was there from day one.

26:57.638 --> 27:04.204
All the missions shot down four times, survived the capture of the Germans.

27:04.305 --> 27:07.488
And then his life since has just been remarkable.

27:07.508 --> 27:11.912
And that's the other thing too, so many of these people, they didn't just serve their country and stop.

27:12.552 --> 27:19.439
They came back and they served their community and their family and their country in such exemplary fashion since.

27:19.459 --> 27:21.921
You know, we talked about not having enough time and enough space.

27:22.357 --> 27:23.999
We don't have enough time for this.

27:24.019 --> 27:24.420
We're done.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.681
Bill Youngkin, thank you.

27:25.841 --> 27:26.382
Thank you, Tom.

27:26.422 --> 27:27.904
I appreciate it very much.

27:27.924 --> 27:33.431
Between us, Bill Youngkin and I have been able to share with you the story of now nearly 90 Brazos Valley vets.

27:33.551 --> 27:35.593
So far, we're not running out of stories.

27:36.434 --> 27:39.338
We only wish each week that we had more space.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.980
I only wish that I had more time.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.942
As long as there are stories to tell, we will tell them.

27:43.343 --> 27:49.090
We salute Bill Youngkin for his service in Vietnam and for continuing to tell the story of those veterans who served before him.

27:49.525 --> 27:51.727
Thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:51.747 --> 27:52.668
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:52.688 --> 28:19.498
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
