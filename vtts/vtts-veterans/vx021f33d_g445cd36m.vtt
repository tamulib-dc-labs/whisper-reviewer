00:15.910 --> 00:39.587
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.669
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.493 --> 00:42.094
B.J.

00:42.114 --> 00:54.572
Bill Kling started Kling Engineering in 1975, but by then his own surveying skills had been tapped in most every arena you can imagine, including in World War II as an infantry soldier with the 102nd.

00:55.714 --> 01:09.154
His unit sailed overseas late in the European campaign in 1944, but in time for the Battle of the Bulge and in time to witness the surrender of thousands of German troops, many soldiers who were interrogated by Bill Kling.

01:09.860 --> 01:13.725
After the war, Bill Kling entered Texas A&M as a 30-year-old freshman.

01:14.346 --> 01:17.730
After the war, he met Floris, and they've been married 57 years now.

01:18.271 --> 01:18.671
B.J.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.214
Bill Kling is our guest today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.577
It's a pleasure to have you, Bill, on Veterans of the Valley.

01:23.597 --> 01:33.950
I'm going to let you sort of take me from 1941 up to 1944 when you first went overseas from New York straight over to France and sort of how you got into the service.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.553
The draft came up and your number came up in 1941.

01:36.734 --> 01:37.595
Is that how it worked?

01:38.135 --> 01:38.636
That's right.

01:38.736 --> 01:39.377
It was...

01:40.420 --> 01:53.216
October of 41, my draft number came up and I had an opportunity to be deferred because I was doing some work for Matagorda County, living in Bay City.

01:53.236 --> 02:01.045
I chose to go ahead and enter the service and serve my year's time and come back and get about my

02:01.615 --> 02:18.786
my life, but Pearl Harbor came along about that time in December of that same year, so it was almost five years later before I got to take up my civilian life again.

02:18.806 --> 02:25.277
Yeah, a lot of young men and women who had planned on just serving a year, Pearl Harbor came, and that changed things for a lot of people, didn't it?

02:25.375 --> 02:25.956
That's right.

02:26.076 --> 02:27.638
We were in for duration then.

02:28.019 --> 02:28.920
Indeed.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.047
I went from Bay City to San Antonio, Fort Sam Houston.

02:34.067 --> 02:34.327
Yes, sir.

02:34.707 --> 02:44.481
Stayed there and was processed into the military and given uniforms and filled out the necessary papers.

02:44.961 --> 02:46.243
This was October in Texas.

02:46.343 --> 02:47.585
What kind of uniform did they give you?

02:48.085 --> 02:48.706
Oh, whoa.

02:49.688 --> 02:50.288
Oh, whoa.

02:50.549 --> 02:55.315
It seemed like it was thick as a blanket and the temperature was in the high 90s or

02:55.632 --> 02:57.495
Low hundreds, I thought.

02:57.836 --> 03:00.159
The Army thought it was October, so it must be cold everywhere.

03:00.199 --> 03:00.861
That's right.

03:01.822 --> 03:12.379
So they sent me to, assigned me to the field artillery, and I was assigned to an instrument and survey school in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

03:14.162 --> 03:16.526
Went to Fort Sill, completed that training.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.990
My mother and dad came up that Christmas.

03:19.595 --> 03:31.869
They had to borrow gasoline ration stamps to have enough gasoline to drive from Bay City up to Lawton, Oklahoma, and Fort Sill.

03:31.889 --> 03:33.250
But anyway, we had a visit.

03:34.211 --> 03:46.665
After I completed my training in the instrument and survey school there, I was assigned to the 45th Division, which had just been activated at Fort Sill.

03:47.438 --> 03:49.781
We were issued equipment there.

03:50.802 --> 03:55.889
Some of it was condemned tents, worn out.

03:56.950 --> 04:05.100
You'd go to sleep at night and look up through the holes in the tents and see the stars and hope it didn't rain, which it did sometime.

04:07.043 --> 04:14.492
After a few weeks there, we were assigned to Camp Barkley out close to Abilene.

04:15.282 --> 04:26.820
Went out to Camp Barkley, moved into a cotton patch in which the cotton had been gathered, but the stalks were still standing up two, three feet high.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.262
And you were in eight-man tents, right?

04:28.462 --> 04:35.994
In eight-man tents with wood-burning stove in there to keep you warm.

04:36.014 --> 04:39.619
We built wooden walkways to stay out of the mud.

04:40.763 --> 04:51.221
During this time, the barracks were being constructed on base there, and we later moved into the barracks.

04:51.782 --> 04:59.696
Stayed there for a few months, and then was assigned to Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

05:01.419 --> 05:05.286
Went up on a troop train, took all of our equipment on the train,

05:07.291 --> 05:20.970
After we got up there and got settled in with our equipment, they moved us down to East Falmouth, Massachusetts, which was on Narragansett Bay.

05:22.032 --> 05:33.147
And our mission there and what we did for the next several months was to establish the routine that was used for landing craft throughout the U.S.

05:33.683 --> 05:37.068
Pacific and European theaters.

05:37.268 --> 05:41.274
For the beach landings, like at Normandy or at Iwo Jima.

05:42.396 --> 05:58.881
Basically the way this worked, they were landing, the troops came in on troop ships, offloaded out in the ocean or bay, wherever, offshore, hopefully outside of enemy artillery fire.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.566
loaded on landing craft and they went in what they call waves.

06:04.708 --> 06:13.460
And the first wave had certain personnel that were key in getting the beachhead established.

06:13.480 --> 06:21.612
And when we first started out, well, I had about 60 pounds of equipment and could barely move.

06:23.355 --> 06:25.037
And we got through, I had a,

06:25.810 --> 06:31.220
a compass and a set of field glasses and my personal weapons and that was it.

06:32.342 --> 06:40.697
But anyway, these tactics were used successfully most of the time throughout the rest of the war.

06:41.909 --> 06:51.785
After this, we were moved to Pine Camp, New York, up in the upper state of New York, just across the St.

06:51.805 --> 06:53.788
Lawrence River from Canada.

06:55.071 --> 06:59.057
It was wintertime, and we were maneuvering against the 2nd Army Division.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.846
Snow was about two feet deep, and it was cold.

07:04.927 --> 07:13.861
Being from Texas, I was ready to get out of there, so there was an opportunity to apply for officer's training school.

07:13.881 --> 07:22.755
So I applied for officer's training and was accepted and sent back to Fort Sill for officer's candidate training.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.643
In December of that year, I was...

07:28.349 --> 07:41.925
graduated as a second lieutenant, and then in January, assigned to the 102nd Division, which was being formed at Camp Maxi.

07:41.945 --> 07:42.665
In Paris, Texas.

07:42.685 --> 07:43.647
In Paris, Texas.

07:43.987 --> 07:50.534
And I understand there were some young soldiers that came from all parts of the country, New York, Illinois, that just weren't used to that.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.698
Most of them didn't.

07:54.843 --> 08:00.308
Well, they'd spent their life on concrete pavement, and they didn't know about post oak trees and grass burrs.

08:00.388 --> 08:07.535
And we'd go out in the field, and it was a real learning experience for them.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.637
For a lot of people, especially the non-Texans.

08:10.097 --> 08:24.411
One of the things that may be kind of interesting, I was assigned to the 380th Battalion, which was one of the three 105 Houcher battalions.

08:26.230 --> 08:34.142
in the 102nd, and my battalion commander was Colonel Hannigan.

08:34.162 --> 08:39.830
Colonel Hannigan was later picked by Earl Rudder for A&M.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.816
He was then General Hannigan, and he was dean of men here at A&M.

08:43.996 --> 08:44.477
Wow.

08:44.497 --> 08:54.432
And we reacquainted ourselves after he came here, and so that was... That's quite, adds to the...

08:54.597 --> 08:56.639
The premise of it is a small world out there.

08:56.659 --> 08:57.140
That's right.

08:57.721 --> 09:05.170
Eventually, you went to Louisiana on maneuvers, and you told me when we spoke yesterday that you saw or you met General Patton.

09:05.630 --> 09:06.451
Yes.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.232
Talk about that.

09:07.433 --> 09:19.407
Well, Patton was there, and if fighting the war had been as physically trying as maneuvers in Louisiana, I don't know if we'd ever made it or not, but I survived the...

09:22.340 --> 09:29.832
the maneuvers in Louisiana and our unit was then assigned to Camp Swift.

09:30.172 --> 09:30.893
Near Bastrop.

09:30.913 --> 09:33.217
Near Bastrop, between Bastrop and Austin.

09:34.058 --> 09:41.750
We completed or went ahead with our training and basically completed our training there.

09:42.131 --> 09:49.883
While we were stationed at Camp Swift, I was assigned to

09:51.247 --> 10:10.407
or my survey department, at that time I was in Division Artillery headquarters, responsible for the training of all the surveyors in the Division Artillery of our division.

10:10.427 --> 10:17.575
I was assigned to then Camp Polk, not Camp Polk, Camp Hood,

10:18.112 --> 10:27.587
and did the basic surveying for what was then called the AGF test or Army Ground Force test.

10:28.569 --> 10:40.087
All units had to go through certain tests at certain phases of their training to determine whether they were proficient at that level of their training.

10:40.107 --> 10:45.756
And so I put in the basic control, kind of an interesting story there.

10:46.310 --> 10:54.843
We wound up doing the job three times, mainly because of the bad data that was given to us to start from.

10:55.144 --> 11:01.734
We were living in tents out in the middle of the impact area out there.

11:01.754 --> 11:05.500
Of course, they weren't firing at that time.

11:06.526 --> 11:08.708
It was hot and we were ready to get out of there.

11:08.748 --> 11:15.877
But anyway, that was my first introduction to the area up there around what's now Fort Hood.

11:16.097 --> 11:16.918
Right.

11:16.938 --> 11:18.419
I want to go ahead and get you overseas.

11:18.459 --> 11:19.420
So we'll fast forward.

11:19.441 --> 11:21.603
You went to New Jersey to Fort Dix.

11:21.623 --> 11:25.227
And then in the fall of 44, you sailed across to France.

11:25.247 --> 11:26.428
And I thought this was interesting.

11:26.448 --> 11:34.137
Whereas most veterans earlier in the war, they took the North Atlantic route to England to prepare for their duty in Europe.

11:34.522 --> 11:40.007
But you were one of the first units to sail directly from New York straight to France.

11:40.027 --> 11:41.209
I believe that's correct.

11:41.229 --> 11:47.535
I think we were the first division to sail directly from the States to the continent of Europe.

11:47.695 --> 11:58.906
So we landed at the port of Cherbourg in France and moved from there where we're living out in the field.

11:59.847 --> 12:02.790
My next task was with

12:02.973 --> 12:07.379
with our executive officer, Colonel Watkins, to run the Red Ball Express.

12:07.639 --> 12:08.200
Right.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.824
Now, talk about this, because this was a truck convoy.

12:10.944 --> 12:16.392
Yeah, the Red Ball Express had 500 two-and-a-half-ton trucks and one-ton trailers.

12:16.572 --> 12:17.353
Yes, sir.

12:17.373 --> 12:27.006
Their mission was to move all the supplies from the beachhead up into the combat area where soldiers needed.

12:27.186 --> 12:31.933
And this was everything from food to ammunition to...

12:32.065 --> 12:36.257
Beds, shoes, all supplies were moved on Red Ball Express.

12:36.558 --> 12:43.257
I think a lot of people would be surprised to understand that Normandy Beach, while it's most famous for D-Day and the D-Day landing and what happened there,

12:43.642 --> 12:50.670
that after that, long after that, it was actually used as a place to deposit these supplies, new supplies, and that's where you would go.

12:51.011 --> 12:55.015
Normally, one place you would go with the Red Ball Express to pick up these supplies.

12:55.055 --> 13:02.344
And when we talk supplies, we're talking, I guess, weapons, Jeeps, big supplies, little supplies, all kind of supplies to fight the war.

13:02.584 --> 13:03.125
That's right.

13:03.185 --> 13:09.953
Now, of course, what the Red Ball Express moved was the supplies, the trucks you'd drive.

13:10.439 --> 13:17.092
But supplies that you could load on a truck, move by truck.

13:18.715 --> 13:32.042
And we used two one-way roads through France, one going from the beachhead up to the combat area and one returning.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.816
There was no civilian traffic or anything else allowed.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.879
Nothing but military and Red Ball Express trucks.

13:38.899 --> 13:41.222
So you felt pretty secure as far as the road.

13:41.242 --> 13:51.574
We did, but we still, we patrolled it all the time with mainly MPs that controlled it, patrolled the area.

13:52.254 --> 13:59.042
There was some looting that went on, and we never stopped a truck.

13:59.360 --> 14:12.598
If it stopped, it stopped because it was broken down, and we had wreckers and service vehicles that would hook onto it, bring it to the shop, and it was repaired and put back in service.

14:12.778 --> 14:13.420
Right, right.

14:13.636 --> 14:16.701
I want to get to this point now because I certainly don't want to miss it.

14:16.721 --> 14:17.842
You were a surveyor.

14:17.862 --> 14:18.323
That's right.

14:18.603 --> 14:29.660
And when people go around town and they see survey crews out surveying whether it's a piece of property here in Bryan College Station, they think of surveyors as people that are establishing property lines and such.

14:30.321 --> 14:39.374
But a surveyor also used those skills to actually fight the war, to shoot the guns, to shoot them accurately, to be efficient with our weaponry.

14:39.394 --> 14:42.799
Talk about that whole aspect of being a surveyor and how it served us in the war.

14:43.775 --> 15:07.113
As far as I can determine from what my experience overseas and what I have read since, the United States field artillery, Army field artillery, was the most efficient of any unit compared to the British, the French, and the Russians, and the Germans.

15:07.954 --> 15:09.276
We were able to take

15:09.897 --> 15:19.231
artillery pieces and fire more guns on the same target accurately than anyone else.

15:19.251 --> 15:35.876
And this was because the first thing that we did when the artillery battery and battalion went into position was to tie the four guns and a battery together.

15:35.896 --> 15:39.381
The next mission was to tie the three batteries

15:40.103 --> 15:58.313
of the battalion together, then the next mission was to tie the battalions all together and tie them into the, and when I say tie in, it's determined the location of each gun with reference to every other gun.

15:58.333 --> 15:58.453
Right.

15:58.473 --> 16:04.643
So that when you fired one gun on a target, you could, with very little

16:04.876 --> 16:08.101
mathematics or effort, you could fire all of them on them.

16:09.383 --> 16:14.089
And this is what allowed us to mass artillery fire.

16:14.110 --> 16:28.791
There was another little thing, I don't know, I wouldn't call it a trick particularly, but it was something that I realized early on that proved to be very effective

16:30.290 --> 16:37.583
The first few rounds of artillery are always, if they're on target, they're the ones that do the most damage.

16:38.726 --> 16:47.802
After two or three rounds have hit, then the enemy that you're firing on has found him a hole if there's one there or moved or something.

16:47.822 --> 16:54.154
So our effort was always to be most effective on that first round.

16:55.771 --> 17:11.245
A 105 howitzer or any howitzer that is able to be the gun barrel, which is able to be raised above 45 degrees, you can fire two rounds out of the same gun and have them hit the target at the same time.

17:12.486 --> 17:25.778
One of them is high angle fire, which as you elevate an artillery piece above 45 degrees, then the shell begins to come back toward you.

17:26.551 --> 17:55.933
So you determine, you shoot the first shell high angle, and the second one low angle fire, below 45 degrees, and with the firing tables and the information that's available, you can figure out the exact time where two shells from the same gun hit the target at the same time, and that's pretty... It was a technology and an intelligence that you learned well before the war that served Americans in the war, you along with the other surveyors.

17:56.183 --> 18:02.050
I want to move on in your relationship with the German enemy.

18:02.411 --> 18:12.703
You were saying that a little bit later on the Germans had been backed up to the Siegfried Line, but it was at that point when going through Holland that you actually encountered some resistance.

18:13.504 --> 18:16.808
And in the form of pillboxes that weren't your normal

18:17.513 --> 18:44.736
pillbox uh encampments not like you would see at normandy or something like that but were camouflaged more as houses talk about about that well i i believe i'm correct when i say the siegfried line was built shorter as a as a counter to the marginal line in france of course now we're we're in holland here uh our unit was at this time was stationed in

18:45.205 --> 18:58.361
which was a border crossing between Germany and Holland and living in Dutch Holland barracks there.

19:00.824 --> 19:01.986
I lost my train of thought.

19:02.026 --> 19:03.488
What was I talking about?

19:03.508 --> 19:06.652
We were talking about the pillboxes.

19:06.752 --> 19:07.192
Oh, yeah.

19:07.613 --> 19:14.301
Now, the first line of defense was all camouflaged in pillboxes, many of them.

19:16.036 --> 19:27.651
as houses or buildings of some sort, the walls of which were able to be folded down and the guns already in place.

19:27.671 --> 19:35.401
Now, the Siegfried Line was probably, would average 15, 20 miles deep.

19:35.421 --> 19:40.828
And the back, the most eastern part of the

19:42.023 --> 20:00.169
of the line was a series of bunkers where they had supplies and communications already in place and it was just a matter of moving in a group of troops and keeping them in reserve in these bunkers until they were needed for a counterattack.

20:03.033 --> 20:04.555
The basic tactics of

20:05.665 --> 20:17.110
of combat is that once you are attacked and the enemy breaks through, if you're gonna survive, you better counterattack somewhere and reestablish control

20:17.613 --> 20:20.477
of an area in which you can work from.

20:20.498 --> 20:20.678
Right.

20:21.058 --> 20:25.746
I want to stop for a second because I want to show a couple of pictures that you supplied to us.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.712
And the first one, I think, is going to take us all the way back to your hometown of Kasi that I chose.

20:29.972 --> 20:34.720
This is a football team, I believe, if I've got the right order yet, that we're going to put on the screen.

20:35.882 --> 20:37.444
There you are.

20:37.424 --> 20:41.634
This is where you grew up in Cossie, just down the road from Bryan College Station.

20:41.654 --> 20:43.618
And this was the 1935 football team.

20:43.638 --> 20:48.209
And I believe you said that you were in the back row standing next to the coach.

20:48.229 --> 20:48.790
That's right.

20:48.850 --> 20:49.612
Who was in the suit.

20:49.632 --> 20:51.155
You're to the left of the coach.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.619
I'm one, two, three.

20:52.699 --> 20:53.400
Four from the left.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.363
Fourth from the left.

20:54.443 --> 20:54.763
Right.

20:55.325 --> 20:56.327
How'd that team do that year?

20:56.965 --> 20:58.510
I don't remember.

20:58.530 --> 20:59.694
Probably not very well.

20:59.714 --> 21:01.800
Probably didn't win a championship or you wouldn't have remembered.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.583
No, no.

21:02.603 --> 21:07.498
We've got another photograph of a young soldier, Bill Kling, and there you are.

21:08.356 --> 21:09.557
Quite a good-looking soldier.

21:09.577 --> 21:11.960
And you were a second lieutenant in that picture, right?

21:12.201 --> 21:13.883
That's shortly after I was commissioned.

21:14.003 --> 21:15.304
Right, after you were commissioned.

21:15.324 --> 21:16.366
See the bar on your shoulder?

21:17.927 --> 21:18.028
Yeah.

21:18.048 --> 21:18.588
There you go.

21:19.629 --> 21:20.050
That's great.

21:21.131 --> 21:31.524
You told us right before we went on the air here, you talked about some instances that you flew during the war, and it had to do with sort of a reconnaissance type of thing.

21:31.864 --> 21:33.486
Talk a little bit about what that was about.

21:34.867 --> 21:42.315
The way the equipment was set up at that time, Division Artillery Headquarters, of course, controlled.

21:42.575 --> 21:55.027
We used light aircraft, Piper Cub-type aircraft, two-seated aircraft for artillery observation to adjust artillery fire.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.592
Basically, this was done by

22:00.601 --> 22:20.483
by firing around as close to the target as you could and then the observer would tell fire direction control how much left or right to move the next round and whether to move it up or down.

22:21.273 --> 22:40.152
I did some of this mainly as a fired core counter-battery, which was using core artillery, and sometimes we had as many as 25 battalions of artillery available to fire.

22:40.813 --> 22:42.235
That's a lot of firepower.

22:42.515 --> 22:50.503
And any time we observed the German artillery,

22:51.074 --> 23:03.750
flying or firing or we got a report from another observer somewhere, then we tried to neutralize that and most of the time we were pretty effective at it.

23:03.770 --> 23:04.791
We've got about four minutes left.

23:04.831 --> 23:07.955
I want you to talk about the interrogation of the Germans who surrendered.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.016
I thought that that was interesting.

23:09.056 --> 23:15.584
You told me about some of the questions that you would ask to sort of discover what their habits were, to sort of discover how to best fight them.

23:15.724 --> 23:18.027
Talk about some of the questions that you ask in the interrogation.

23:18.530 --> 23:34.589
Well, one of the common things that we tried to interrupt was the hot meal that a soldier got in the wintertime in cold weather is a real morale booster.

23:35.209 --> 23:41.837
If he's eating cold meals in a foxhole all the time, it gets pretty dreary.

23:42.239 --> 23:54.851
So if he can meet even in small groups with some of his compadres and have a hot meal, even if it's nothing but a hot cup of coffee, it's a tremendous morale booster.

23:55.552 --> 24:02.218
We realized that early on and made an effort to interrupt this.

24:02.239 --> 24:08.905
So one of the questions that we would typically ask was, do you have

24:09.712 --> 24:12.856
have a hot meal every day and what time is it?

24:13.777 --> 24:25.090
And we wouldn't try to ask them the military capabilities of their unit because they were well versed in the Geneva Convention.

24:26.231 --> 24:38.706
But you would ask what most people would consider irrelevant questions which once you fit them together form a pattern

24:41.234 --> 24:46.606
And I think we were effective in doing this.

24:46.946 --> 24:50.253
The 102nd had an interesting patch that you supplied to us today.

24:50.294 --> 24:50.935
I'm holding it here.

24:50.995 --> 24:52.037
I think we can get a shot of it.

24:52.378 --> 24:52.779
You called it.

24:52.799 --> 24:54.402
It was the Ozark Division.

24:54.422 --> 24:54.703
Is that right?

24:54.723 --> 24:55.244
That's right.

24:55.405 --> 25:00.255
The outer yellow ring there is the O, the Z in the middle with the arc underneath.

25:00.843 --> 25:12.658
It was a unit that was formed in World War I, put in reserve or disbanded between World War I and reactivated World War II.

25:13.439 --> 25:16.303
And this is a unit that I went overseas with.

25:16.543 --> 25:16.843
Right.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.086
We just have a few minutes left, so we have to fast forward.

25:19.507 --> 25:24.473
You did not have quite enough points to come home as early as some, and you stayed until December of 1945.

25:24.613 --> 25:26.175
It was quite a trip.

25:26.155 --> 25:27.377
coming home in the ocean.

25:27.397 --> 25:32.946
You thought maybe things were going to end on your trip home because of a storm that you came through, right?

25:32.966 --> 25:43.623
Yes, we left out of Marseille, France, sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar and headed for the Virginia coast.

25:45.726 --> 25:49.272
Not too far out, we ran into a storm.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.876
This is in January.

25:52.666 --> 25:57.591
December and January of 45, 46.

25:59.053 --> 26:11.106
The weather got so bad that sailors were not allowed, or none of us were allowed out on deck except in an emergency situation, and then that was with safety harness on.

26:12.187 --> 26:21.677
The lines that you could see outside the ship, the seawater would freeze to where they were four to six inches in diameter.

26:21.893 --> 26:26.282
the waves were 50, 60 feet high.

26:26.362 --> 26:33.776
You'd look out the porthole and you looked up to see the crest of the wave when the ship was down in the trough of the wave.

26:34.338 --> 26:41.151
So they, which I think wisely, turned south and added about a week to our

26:41.924 --> 26:43.886
time coming back.

26:43.906 --> 26:51.814
There were four of us that played bridge all the time on there and for a long time and maybe somewhere around the house I've still got the score pad.

26:51.854 --> 26:55.758
We were up to almost 40,000 points.

26:56.619 --> 26:58.561
38,000 some odd points.

26:58.721 --> 26:59.922
We kept running total.

27:00.443 --> 27:02.385
Bill claimed the time just goes too fast.

27:02.425 --> 27:08.691
You came home, you started cleaning engineering in 1975 and you and Floris were married 57 years ago and

27:09.143 --> 27:12.657
Graduated from A&M in 1953 as a 34-year-old senior.

27:12.998 --> 27:13.460
That's correct.

27:13.962 --> 27:18.158
And thank you very much for your service, and we appreciate you being a guest on Veterans of the Valley.

27:18.408 --> 27:20.070
It's been an honor to visit with you.

27:20.130 --> 27:20.992
I appreciate it, Tom.

27:21.012 --> 27:22.113
Thank you, Bill.

27:22.133 --> 27:33.149
I learn new things with every veteran that I visit on Veterans of the Valley, and it's amazing to learn how the familiar work of today's surveyor helped us win the tactics battle in the European campaign, thanks to B.J.

27:33.169 --> 27:39.538
Bill Kling of College Station for his service in the war and his continued contributions as a valued citizen.

27:39.518 --> 27:41.382
Thanks to all veterans for their service.

27:41.562 --> 27:44.588
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:44.609 --> 27:49.980
And be sure to read about other stories of veterans in Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in the Eagle.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.863
For Bill Kling, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:51.884 --> 27:54.068
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:05.573 --> 28:18.148
you
