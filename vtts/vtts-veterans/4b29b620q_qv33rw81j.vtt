00:01.718 --> 00:11.982
December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.

00:12.483 --> 00:16.713
We interrupt this broadcast, bringing this important voting from the United Press/

00:16.733 --> 00:19.018
Washington, the White House announces Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor.

00:32.228 --> 00:34.051
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.331 --> 00:35.412
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.254 --> 00:43.944
Dr. Jeff Huffman is also Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Huffman and is a somewhat new-to-town urologist at the College Station Medical Center.

00:44.305 --> 01:00.227
His story is about as unique as they come because at age 51, after the attacks of September 11, 2001, that's when Dr. Huffman heard President Bush speak to Congress and the country and tell them that this war effort in Iraq would take the help of all Americans.

01:00.764 --> 01:04.649
So it was then that Dr. Huffman knew the president was speaking to him.

01:04.669 --> 01:08.134
He also knew there was a critical shortage of surgeons in the war zone.

01:08.735 --> 01:15.383
So he closed his practice and his tenured professorship at Southern Cal, where he'd been for 21 years.

01:15.684 --> 01:26.158
He got commissioned for the first time into the military, and in 2007 was sent to the American Military Hospital in Balad, about 45 miles north of Baghdad.

01:26.178 --> 01:28.020
That was a five-month tour during the surge.

01:28.439 --> 01:30.704
In 2009, he returned for a three-month tour.

01:31.145 --> 01:38.581
Dr. Huffman fixed people, American military, Iraqi military, civilians, and yes, even the enemy, Al-Qaeda.

01:39.222 --> 01:41.207
That's just part of his amazing story.

01:41.227 --> 01:46.518
Recently, Dr. Huffman was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the President of the United States.

01:46.638 --> 01:48.422
Welcome, Lieutenant Colonel Huffman.

01:48.757 --> 01:51.824
Dr. Jeff Huffman to Veterans of the Valley.

01:51.844 --> 01:53.888
Honored to meet you and an honor to have you here.

01:53.908 --> 01:54.309
Thanks, Tom.

01:54.449 --> 01:54.870
Thank you.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.033
It's great to have you here.

01:56.554 --> 02:01.365
You grew up in Dixon, Illinois, which has its own fame because of a fellow named Ronald Reagan.

02:01.525 --> 02:03.449
That was his childhood home.

02:03.469 --> 02:05.213
And that's where you grew up, right?

02:05.193 --> 02:12.801
Yeah, it's a very special, real special place, and especially because of President Reagan having some time in that town also.

02:13.102 --> 02:17.467
And having a chance to meet him was one of the more special days of my life.

02:17.627 --> 02:17.887
Right.

02:17.907 --> 02:23.073
You said your mother was a docent at the childhood home, sort of showed people around and all that.

02:23.093 --> 02:26.477
So she got to meet him on quite a few occasions.

02:26.557 --> 02:26.817
Right.

02:26.837 --> 02:32.183
And I had a chance to meet him in his Century City office after he left the president's office.

02:32.203 --> 02:33.124
So it was very special.

02:33.155 --> 02:41.424
You got interested in medicine by working one summer in your high school days at a hospital, and you thought this is a pretty good thing, making people well and fixing people.

02:41.444 --> 03:00.584
So you decided to go into the medical profession, went to the University of Indiana, you're a Hoosier, and then to Loyola in Chicago for med school, worked in Peoria, University of Chicago, New York at Sloan Kettering, and then to California, where eventually you started a 21-year career at the University of Southern California.

03:00.604 --> 03:02.706
I wanted to fast forward to there because

03:03.057 --> 03:13.528
Like we said in the open, tell us what happened after 9-11 when you heard that speech from President Bush and how it sort of led you to make a radical change in your life and your family's life.

03:14.048 --> 03:27.242
Well, I think my story is probably not that unique because I've run into a lot of health care providers over the years in Iraq and around the military, nurses, doctors, other providers who have a similar story.

03:27.282 --> 03:30.606
But our children were out of the house.

03:31.186 --> 03:32.828
They're older.

03:33.263 --> 03:35.967
And I heard the call of the president and then almost

03:36.554 --> 03:47.327
same time found out that there was this critical need of surgeons in the military and looked into the possibility of getting the commission, even though I was really old.

03:48.108 --> 03:52.453
Yeah, 51 is old for just getting into the military, right?

03:52.473 --> 03:58.480
Absolutely, and had no prior military experience at all, unlike most of the other folks that I was working around.

03:59.021 --> 04:04.367
But the Air Force was really good to me and I was always be happy that I made that decision.

04:04.347 --> 04:04.687
Right.

04:04.707 --> 04:06.950
It took you about three years, I think you said, to get the commission.

04:06.970 --> 04:09.133
Because of your age, it took a little bit longer.

04:09.153 --> 04:14.520
But you had done a lot of trauma work in California at your post there at Southern Cal.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.305
So you sort of were able to hit the ground running as far as what you were going to be doing.

04:18.325 --> 04:23.832
Yeah, I've been fortunate to receive a lot of excellent training, and the Air Force supplemented that.

04:23.972 --> 04:29.039
And all throughout my career, I've been around some really standout physicians to work with.

04:29.059 --> 04:30.140
So I've been very fortunate.

04:30.421 --> 04:32.363
I thought it was interesting you told me

04:32.596 --> 04:36.240
that you go from civilian to into the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel.

04:36.640 --> 04:44.307
People might have raised their eyebrows at that, but the Army sort of has a policy to give you credit for the training that you'd had the previous 18 years.

04:44.408 --> 04:46.049
Yeah, I wasn't aware of that at the time.

04:46.089 --> 04:49.853
They gave me credit for 18 years, actually, a board-certified urologist.

04:49.953 --> 04:54.577
And they said, well, we didn't have to pay for any of that going along, so we're going to give you credit.

04:56.499 --> 05:00.223
Because at first, you didn't want to accept that advanced rank.

05:00.507 --> 05:03.050
having never been in the military, but said, no, you got to do that.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.312
And it's important to take that role.

05:05.332 --> 05:06.714
So I did.

05:06.734 --> 05:07.655
Indeed.

05:07.675 --> 05:13.080
2007, you had been commissioned in 2005, training for a couple of years.

05:13.140 --> 05:20.728
And in 2007, you were deployed to Iraq to serve about five months, a little over five months there.

05:21.129 --> 05:24.613
Talk about that deployment, because it was part of the search.

05:24.633 --> 05:29.738
And this is very intense work, but work that, like you told me, that you loved.

05:30.427 --> 05:32.549
Yeah, it was pushing the envelope for me.

05:32.589 --> 05:40.398
But the thing that's unique about the providers there is you develop a camaraderie and a team approach really quickly.

05:40.419 --> 05:47.367
And we had a group of surgeons and physicians and nurses that really got together really fast to work as a team.

05:48.248 --> 05:56.337
And the sooner we did that, the better, because we became busy very quickly in Bilad.

05:57.218 --> 05:57.438
Yeah.

05:57.498 --> 05:59.100
Talk about Bilad.

05:59.738 --> 06:03.117
I think you said it's one of the largest military

06:03.502 --> 06:06.345
medical bases, medical hospitals in Iraq.

06:06.365 --> 06:19.737
BALAD is unbelievable and it's the hub of a healthcare network in Iraq where the spokes go out from the hub to all the forward operating bases and the combat surgical hospital, the cash units.

06:19.757 --> 06:31.028
So all our injured personnel are taken by chopper, fixed wing aircraft into BALAD, evaluated and then put on the C-17s to be taken to Germany.

06:31.008 --> 06:41.963
So we would see the injuries from the forward operating bases, evaluate them, and then we'd also see some direct injuries from the areas around Balad.

06:42.364 --> 06:53.860
It started off as a tent hospital, and it looked just like a MASH scene when I got there, and it was very similar to MASH with a pad and the choppers that come in and the personnel.

06:54.262 --> 07:02.566
And while we were there in 07, we did transfer to a fixed facility, so we got rid of the hospital facility into a fixed facility.

07:03.248 --> 07:05.976
But it was very much like MASH when you first got there.

07:06.040 --> 07:12.749
Yeah, we talked about that earlier and said that the viewers can sort of get an idea because of the popular TV show.

07:12.829 --> 07:18.497
It was very, very similar to what you saw there, not the booze parties that they had.

07:18.517 --> 07:20.359
So there was a little Hollywood that they threw in.

07:20.379 --> 07:32.976
But as far as the procedure, the rooms, the medical, the surgery, the people all working together, that was a very realistically and obviously the technical people that worked on that show really knew what they were doing.

07:33.040 --> 07:33.701
Oh, absolutely.

07:33.741 --> 07:46.397
And you have to do, because of all the bad things you see all the time, you end up having a lot of antics and playing jokes on each other and having a good time the best you can in a war zone.

07:47.118 --> 07:52.405
There's nothing fun about it, but you do try to get to know each other and have fun together.

07:52.485 --> 07:55.489
And that worked out very well.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.693
So you just try to make the most out of a very difficult situation.

07:59.517 --> 08:15.417
I know that a lot of it is sensitive, a lot of it is graphic even to explain the type of wounds that you saw, but you saw the worst of the worst and people just really don't realize the type of... We hear about the deaths, we hear about the people who die and the families that are left behind.

08:15.920 --> 08:24.312
but I don't think we hear near enough about the survivors and how some of them have to survive with mortal wounds that last all their lives.

08:24.333 --> 08:30.942
And these are a lot of the people that you saw quickly fixed as well as best you could and said goodbye to.

08:31.744 --> 08:37.472
Yeah, the survival rate of the folks that made it to the facility

08:37.908 --> 08:41.653
It was 98%, and I think it still is in that neighborhood, 98%.

08:41.953 --> 08:52.306
So if they could make it to the facility, they had a 98% chance of surviving, which is unbelievable, given the types of injuries that we saw and the volume of injuries that we saw.

08:53.347 --> 09:01.958
In 07, our service members would rapidly be evaluated and treated, resuscitated, and ongoing to Germany and then back home.

09:02.275 --> 09:08.642
within a very short period of time, so it was hard for us to get to know anybody to any great extent.

09:09.643 --> 09:16.610
We got to see some people, however, and I do have some people I stay in contact with that were treated there, so it's very rewarding.

09:17.912 --> 09:21.936
Burns, penetration wounds, I mean, like I said, the worst of the worst is what you said.

09:21.956 --> 09:23.938
Yeah, it's pretty much like MASH in that regard.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.920
I think the burns are, they're all bad.

09:26.643 --> 09:41.665
But these IED wounds are just horrible because they fill these improvised explosive devices with all sorts of bad things, you know, nuts and bolts, nails, door hinges.

09:41.645 --> 09:49.760
you name it's in there, and we called them shark bites because as they hit the body, they basically just take out chunks of tissue.

09:50.542 --> 10:00.621
And so you would see a patient with these chunks of tissue missing that you had to go in and clean up and stop the bleeding and treat.

10:00.981 --> 10:04.007
So the burns were probably the worst.

10:04.342 --> 10:10.005
I think our personnel with burns around the country and in Germany just do a great job.

10:10.025 --> 10:15.246
Getting folks on the aircraft to Germany and to

10:15.513 --> 10:19.121
hospital here, whether it's in Baltimore or San Antonio, to be treated.

10:19.261 --> 10:20.283
Just remarkable.

10:20.303 --> 10:21.326
Right, certainly, yeah.

10:21.506 --> 10:26.316
BAMC in San Antonio is probably one of the most famous as far as burn units.

10:26.336 --> 10:27.960
And we would be in direct contact.

10:29.002 --> 10:35.496
I didn't know this going over, but we'd be in direct contact with the folks at BAMC as we had a burn patient coming in the ER.

10:35.915 --> 10:38.300
we would open up the lines of communication right away.

10:38.881 --> 10:41.266
And we would start consulting with the folks.

10:41.286 --> 10:49.702
So along the different changes in the echelon of care, they would be familiar with what was coming and what they were expecting.

10:49.762 --> 10:51.385
So it was really good communication.

10:51.426 --> 10:52.708
I was impressed by that.

10:52.688 --> 11:00.037
When I grew up in San Antonio, it was known by its full name, Brook Army Medical Center, but BAMSI came along later on, so I want to give it its full name.

11:00.518 --> 11:03.922
You told a couple of stories, one about observing.

11:04.383 --> 11:09.750
You're in a reserve unit, and you serve in Riverside, California, in a reserve unit still.

11:10.450 --> 11:14.055
You told one story about a briefing at that reserve unit at Riverside.

11:14.153 --> 11:19.789
Yeah, you know, I'm not a military guy by history or anything, so all this was pretty new to me.

11:19.849 --> 11:26.087
And I have to thank Colonel Sanchez and Weisenberger and McGregor there for allowing me to do all this.

11:26.557 --> 11:32.002
But before my first tour to Iraq, you get an intel briefing.

11:32.823 --> 11:35.566
And so it's kind of smoke and mirrors a little bit.

11:35.666 --> 11:40.310
It's behind closed doors and dark room with a TV screen and pilots were there.

11:40.350 --> 11:41.552
There's only half a dozen of us.

11:41.612 --> 11:48.579
And they showed a plot of the base, Balad Air Base, or the Army called it Anaconda.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.142
And they had about a dozen red flags on the

11:52.612 --> 11:55.836
on the map and said, do you guys know what this is?

11:55.856 --> 11:57.118
And I said, yeah, I don't know what that is.

11:57.258 --> 12:02.144
He said, well, this is where 12 rockets have hit in the last 12 hours.

12:02.164 --> 12:07.250
And they said, well, not only that, but did you know they called this base Mortaritaville?

12:08.652 --> 12:11.436
And so I said, no, I didn't know that either.

12:11.456 --> 12:17.624
So it was pretty active indirect fire attacks on the base.

12:17.664 --> 12:18.805
It was a real thing.

12:20.050 --> 12:26.990
You did your second tour in 2009, but I want to go back to some numbers that you told me on that first tour during the surge.

12:27.010 --> 12:33.790
And you said that your unit did just about 2,800 procedures, and of those, you think your number was around 300?

12:34.090 --> 12:34.831
Yes.

12:36.573 --> 12:38.336
It's not glamorous surgery at all.

12:38.676 --> 12:39.978
There's probably eight of us, I think.

12:42.421 --> 12:50.152
One of the secrets to success, I think, in the war zone was the standardization of how we approached the surgical procedures.

12:50.172 --> 12:55.018
Very standardized, doing the same thing, the same techniques.

12:54.998 --> 13:01.865
And a lot of it was just basic wound care and caring for injured folks.

13:02.225 --> 13:04.668
A lot of it was very serious injuries, though, too.

13:04.768 --> 13:14.397
But the bulk of it was just wound care and taking care of these IED wounds, which were the vast majority of the injuries.

13:14.417 --> 13:23.006
You told me, and I want you to sort of just take it from here, the people that you treated and who you treated there.

13:23.767 --> 13:24.988
Tell me what you told me this morning.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.692
Yeah, I think that was a surprise.

13:26.913 --> 13:29.055
You know you're gonna treat service members.

13:29.195 --> 13:30.977
That's what you're there for, that's why you join.

13:31.477 --> 13:41.907
And I think in 07, we probably, maybe 40% or maybe 50%, I don't recall the exact numbers, were our service members and coalition troops.

13:41.927 --> 13:47.112
But then another 40 or so percent were Iraqi civilians, police, and military.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.794
But we also treated the bad guys.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.157
And that was kind of a new thing, and we sat down before

13:52.492 --> 13:55.116
when we first got there and talked about treating the bad guys.

13:55.497 --> 14:02.568
You're treating the guy that may have just killed a couple of our people, and you're supposed to save his life.

14:02.608 --> 14:08.998
And that was a little bit, you had to wrestle with that just a little bit, but when you found out that taking care of this guy

14:09.164 --> 14:13.851
and making sure he could stay around to give some information that may save lives in the future.

14:13.871 --> 14:15.334
And that's how you reconcile that.

14:15.935 --> 14:16.716
Exactly.

14:17.357 --> 14:22.144
I remember all of us, we would try to communicate with the patients as best we could.

14:22.745 --> 14:23.687
We're trained that way.

14:23.787 --> 14:27.873
And I remember one al-Qaeda guy, and he was hardcore.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.877
And he didn't want to be alive.

14:30.518 --> 14:32.741
He wanted to be dead.

14:32.781 --> 14:33.502
No doubt about it.

14:33.863 --> 14:34.564
He had a bad...

14:35.118 --> 14:39.843
leg injury, and I was going to have to take off his leg the rest of the way.

14:39.863 --> 14:48.653
And so through our translator, Dr. Jamal, who was an Iraqi physician and now an American, we said, well, make sure he knows what I'm going to do.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.435
And Dr. Jamal would tell him.

14:51.336 --> 14:55.620
And the patient, who's the Al-Qaeda, would talk back to Dr. Jamal.

14:55.660 --> 14:59.865
And then Dr. Jamal would tell me, he said, he doesn't want you to do that surgery.

14:59.885 --> 15:00.906
He wants you to let him die.

15:01.679 --> 15:03.481
And he says, in the name of Allah.

15:04.102 --> 15:08.267
So I would say to Dr. Jamal, to the patient actually, and he would translate.

15:08.287 --> 15:14.514
And I said, well, in the name of my God and my supervisors and me, we're gonna save your life.

15:15.636 --> 15:16.557
That's who we are.

15:17.478 --> 15:23.986
And then Dr. Jamal would translate that again and patient would say back to him and there'd be a lot of interchange.

15:24.026 --> 15:25.868
And I'd say, well, what did he say?

15:25.888 --> 15:27.290
And he said, well, you don't wanna hear what he said.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.431
I said, no, no, I wanna hear.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.492
He said, no, you don't wanna hear.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.635
And I said, well, okay, he said,

15:31.818 --> 15:37.492
He said, if you save my life, tell the doctor that if I'm alive, I'm going to come and get him.

15:37.732 --> 15:40.118
I'm going to make sure he doesn't live either.

15:40.559 --> 15:44.308
If you save my life, I'll make sure he'll come and kill me, basically.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.652
So that was a little different.

15:47.173 --> 15:52.558
That's pretty eye-opening to hear that and then put on the scrubs and go to work and... Yeah, yeah.

15:52.898 --> 15:54.820
So I'm not... I'm glad he didn't find you.

15:54.980 --> 15:59.344
I'm not an intel person or anything, but there is a hardcore group of people that just hate us.

15:59.364 --> 15:59.564
Right.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.126
And it's because we're Americans.

16:02.347 --> 16:02.747
Right.

16:03.267 --> 16:04.368
That's a hardcore Al-Qaeda.

16:04.489 --> 16:04.989
That's hardcore.

16:05.009 --> 16:07.191
Now you also have the thugs that you've said.

16:07.211 --> 16:11.795
Yeah, to me they're like an LA gangster or something.

16:11.815 --> 16:15.038
I saw plenty of that in LAC USC Med Center.

16:15.018 --> 16:20.966
where these guys would maybe be paid $500 to go shoot at Americans for two weeks.

16:20.986 --> 16:24.551
And maybe the next two weeks, they'd be paid by our people to get some information.

16:25.533 --> 16:29.378
But if they got injured, they wanted us to do all we could to save them.

16:29.398 --> 16:30.459
So it was a different breed.

16:31.160 --> 16:31.821
Very interesting.

16:31.881 --> 16:32.642
They were hurting.

16:32.662 --> 16:33.483
Let's go to some pictures.

16:33.504 --> 16:36.047
You've got some great photographs.

16:36.753 --> 16:43.540
that were taken, and as we look at it, sort of comment briefly on, we have the date there of when this was, so go ahead.

16:43.560 --> 17:05.022
Well, this is in the tent hospital during the surge, and I'm working with Matt Senna, who's a wonderful surgeon up in Davis, California, and you can see that little tin can that we operate in, and they actually can have two surgeries going on at the same time, and we're doing a neck dissection on somebody who had a penetrating wound to the neck.

17:06.436 --> 17:07.351
Okay?

17:07.887 --> 17:09.830
The tent hospital was unbelievable.

17:09.850 --> 17:12.594
This is the new facility, which opened in August of 07.

17:12.654 --> 17:19.423
And this is the, at that time, the Air Force Surgeon General, General Rodebush, visited with us.

17:19.443 --> 17:28.916
And at the end of the day, we had, I think we had 19 or 20 patients come through, and he stayed and watched us take care of this mass casualty drill.

17:28.936 --> 17:32.000
And this was at 2 or 3 in the morning as we were finishing up that day.

17:32.521 --> 17:36.747
He was a real special friend, and it was nice of these folks when they came by to visit.

17:38.768 --> 17:40.810
This is another real special.

17:41.090 --> 17:41.951
You meet a lot of good people.

17:42.031 --> 17:50.359
John Martin is a neurosurgeon who was shot during the tour in 07, and he was awarded a Purple Heart in a very moving ceremony.

17:50.419 --> 17:57.266
It was actually the anniversary, August 7th, when George Washington gave out the first Purple Heart.

17:57.446 --> 18:02.912
So it was a very special day for John and for us to honor him.

18:02.932 --> 18:03.012
Wow.

18:03.032 --> 18:05.434
We had our swamp without the alcohol.

18:05.853 --> 18:12.621
So after we're done for the day and you're resting, we'd have some water and some fake beer.

18:12.681 --> 18:21.532
They'd have the non-alcoholic beer, and we'd go smoke cigars on the roof of the hospital and waiting for the choppers to come in, which you could hear in the background.

18:21.592 --> 18:24.636
So these are the surgeons and staff members.

18:24.656 --> 18:31.123
And Dr. Eppinger is second from the left there is the trauma czar.

18:31.163 --> 18:34.948
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon down at Wilford Hall, real special guy.

18:35.114 --> 18:42.066
and Mike Eppinger and then John Martin, the guy that got Purple Heart was also there.

18:45.492 --> 18:50.862
Again, just like MASH, the chopper lands on the pad and our folks go out and

18:51.533 --> 18:54.537
pick up the patient in the gurney and take them into the hospital.

18:54.637 --> 18:55.218
Very similar.

18:55.598 --> 19:05.692
The things you don't realize, for me it was a surprise, probably shouldn't have been, the noise, unbelievable noise all the time between the jets and the choppers.

19:06.593 --> 19:11.279
And then the fact that most of our operations were at night, so most of our work was at night too.

19:11.299 --> 19:13.743
So that made sense when you think of it.

19:13.763 --> 19:18.689
You can almost hear Radar O'Reilly, you know, saying, you know, incoming wounded when you look at something like that.

19:18.789 --> 19:21.373
Yeah, definitely.

19:21.393 --> 19:21.473
Wow.

19:21.875 --> 19:26.442
And this was a special time when I came home to Ontario Airport near the base there at Riverside.

19:26.502 --> 19:28.445
And that's my wife, Terri.

19:28.465 --> 19:36.257
And you really appreciate where you're from when you set foot on American soil again.

19:36.317 --> 19:37.800
It's a very special time.

19:38.401 --> 19:44.410
And the welcoming we got at BWI in Baltimore was also very special.

19:46.713 --> 19:49.738
And again, Dr. Senna taking a look up here.

19:50.866 --> 19:51.927
It's all about the people.

19:52.748 --> 19:54.510
John Beaney is on the left there.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.792
We're doing the surgery at the new hospital.

19:56.812 --> 20:01.057
John is a trauma surgeon down at Wilford Hall, too, and another real special surgeon.

20:01.077 --> 20:02.138
Right.

20:02.158 --> 20:02.879
How many nurses?

20:03.559 --> 20:06.002
I mean, full complement of nurses?

20:06.483 --> 20:16.693
Yeah, we had an ICU award and the ORs, and I think we probably had 40 nurses, roughly, and a real special group.

20:16.753 --> 20:19.236
They worked six days a week and sometimes seven.

20:19.503 --> 20:21.606
They both civilian and military, or are they?

20:22.507 --> 20:25.111
Reservists and military, yeah.

20:25.272 --> 20:27.976
A lot of reservists over there in 07 and 09.

20:30.519 --> 20:34.145
Again, John Beeney, and we had a lot of, that's a nurse anesthetist there.

20:34.806 --> 20:39.132
I think we had eight nurse anesthetists and two or three anesthesiologists in our group.

20:40.867 --> 20:45.532
And then this is Jason, and Jason is a special forces guy.

20:45.552 --> 20:59.906
They would come by and spend about four weeks with us to learn basic surgical skills, because as they go out and do their special operations, these guys would have to provide their own first aid in the field.

20:59.926 --> 21:05.832
And so Jason was a special friend, and these guys are unbelievably talented.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.194
I mean, we're so lucky to have them on our side.

21:08.575 --> 21:09.996
These guys are really great.

21:12.085 --> 21:14.247
This is my, I call it my turtle picture.

21:15.329 --> 21:20.955
During the alarm read, at that time anyway, you had to put your helmet and your body armor on.

21:20.975 --> 21:27.923
And just about this time as they snapped the picture, there was another rocket attack and I was getting ready to hit the ground.

21:28.143 --> 21:34.591
So it looks like I'm ducking into my shell there, but it just kind of gives a feel for what goes on there.

21:34.851 --> 21:36.473
If you're operating on a patient,

21:37.128 --> 21:38.631
you continue to operate.

21:40.094 --> 21:44.202
So I think there were five or six times where we were operating during Alarm Red.

21:44.824 --> 21:51.998
And that's the highest level of alarm where you have an organized attack, three or more rocket attacks at one time.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.990
You got to meet General Petraeus.

21:55.010 --> 21:55.311
Oh, yeah.

21:56.314 --> 22:04.295
You get these DVs that come by quite a bit, and they're usually at night when the choppers fly, which is our advantage.

22:04.315 --> 22:05.879
So somebody said, well, clean off your desk.

22:05.899 --> 22:07.603
We got a DV coming by and a party.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.586
And I said, fine.

22:08.566 --> 22:10.288
And then I get all that done.

22:10.308 --> 22:11.971
I look up and I see those stars.

22:12.511 --> 22:13.513
And I said, I know that guy.

22:13.553 --> 22:14.995
That's General Petraeus.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.458
So here we are at midnight and he's walking through.

22:17.518 --> 22:20.722
And he sat down and talked to the docs.

22:20.742 --> 22:22.825
And it was very special.

22:23.205 --> 22:24.567
He had something to say to us.

22:24.988 --> 22:27.551
Wanted to make sure we had everything we needed.

22:27.571 --> 22:31.116
It was very special to me because it happened to be June 6th.

22:31.877 --> 22:32.297
Right.

22:32.718 --> 22:36.803
And I had just watched the movie Ike on a DVD.

22:37.124 --> 22:37.324
Right.

22:37.523 --> 22:45.796
And we were talking about that and it was a real special day and to have him be there meant a lot to me and to all the folks that he met.

22:46.557 --> 22:57.675
You mentioned that you had not had any military experience before 2005 when you were commissioned, but your family, your father served on the USS Alabama and the Pacific in World War II.

22:57.993 --> 23:01.098
And your father-in-law was at Pearl Harbor on the Arizona.

23:01.158 --> 23:01.979
Yeah, that's correct.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.726
Yeah, I feel very fortunate to have that type of upbringing.

23:06.846 --> 23:10.652
All my uncles were in the Navy.

23:10.672 --> 23:18.684
So in some ways I had that need to satisfy that military service too growing up.

23:19.746 --> 23:19.866
Right.

23:20.538 --> 23:27.353
And, yeah, my father actually ended up retiring down near Mobile, where the Alabama is in Dry Dock.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.218
So we enjoyed going down to visit that.

23:29.238 --> 23:29.859
Except I've been there.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.244
Went there for a baseball tournament about three or four years ago.

23:32.264 --> 23:34.149
That was the first thing I did was tour the Alabama.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.995
Yeah, it's a nice part of the country down there.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.478
Yeah, it really is.

23:38.498 --> 23:40.082
Well, you've got to be very, very proud of that.

23:40.484 --> 23:44.272
Now, your second tour, we haven't talked much about that.

23:44.313 --> 23:45.515
We've got about five more minutes.

23:45.575 --> 23:47.159
It was a three-month tour in 2009.

23:47.921 --> 23:48.662
Quite a bit different.

23:49.003 --> 23:50.286
This was not during the surge.

23:50.306 --> 23:55.457
This is when things were wrapping up as far as the effort in Iraq, of course.

23:55.478 --> 23:59.286
But it was a marked difference when you went back for those three months.

23:59.620 --> 24:12.159
Yes, I got a call from the Surgeon General's office that they wanted to have a urologist, and they asked me because I also had the general surgery training and could do both those jobs, and it was very nice to go over.

24:12.960 --> 24:18.188
Several of my buddies were going back, so it's really hard to say no when you have that type of calling.

24:18.208 --> 24:24.497
My buddy, Tracy Jones, who's an unbelievably talented vascular surgeon and C-130 pilot down at

24:24.663 --> 24:28.328
down at Lackland and Wilford Hall, he was going back.

24:28.348 --> 24:33.075
It was very rewarding, though, because we saw that the tempo had decreased drastically.

24:34.096 --> 24:36.600
And so you saw a big change over that two years.

24:36.620 --> 24:41.166
And I reported that to a lot of parents and other folks that have been there earlier on.

24:41.186 --> 24:45.152
And they like to hear that when we came back in 09, that things were getting better.

24:45.436 --> 24:53.548
The other thing is we got to react with some of the Iraqi folks, which we didn't before because the base was off limits at that earlier time.

24:53.848 --> 24:54.990
Right.

24:55.030 --> 25:03.503
You came back, you practiced four years in Sulphur Springs, Texas, and then came to College Station, which was a little bit closer to Austin where your kids were.

25:04.264 --> 25:08.070
And so you came here and you've been here for about six months.

25:08.090 --> 25:13.097
And also because of the robotic surgery that I know that you're very,

25:13.432 --> 25:18.326
into, you had that at Southern Cal, you had here, did not have it at Sulphur Springs.

25:18.346 --> 25:22.418
So talk a little bit about your practice now, six months here.

25:22.478 --> 25:25.045
You're a urologist and talk about your practice here now.

25:25.278 --> 25:30.427
I need to thank my associate, John Cochran, for allowing me to come in and share his office and work with him.

25:30.627 --> 25:32.691
He's been an absolute delight to work with.

25:33.292 --> 25:39.143
Tom Jackson, who allowed me to come here and has the confidence in me to bring me here.

25:39.183 --> 25:43.911
And I really share his vision for health care in this community, and I really thank all the

25:43.891 --> 25:46.056
the medical community for their support too.

25:47.118 --> 25:54.033
I started doing the minimally invasive surgery a number of years ago and then robotic surgery at USC back in 06.

25:55.175 --> 25:59.926
And then started doing it again when I came here in December.

25:59.946 --> 26:03.874
So we take care of the prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer,

26:03.955 --> 26:12.303
I like to do kidney stones, work on incontinence and I see adult and pediatric patients.

26:12.323 --> 26:18.709
And the other thing I enjoy is I go to Brenham two days a week and also to Navasota one day a week.

26:18.729 --> 26:24.535
So I get to see the surrounding areas and interact with the folks and the medical providers down in those clinics too.

26:25.196 --> 26:31.802
You've had a blessed life and you're being able to serve in your profession and help people.

26:32.069 --> 26:36.917
Congratulations, the Meritorious Service Medal that you were awarded.

26:37.478 --> 26:39.701
It is designed for non-combat.

26:40.282 --> 26:49.096
Of course, they look at those mortar shells in there, and you might dispute whether it was non-combat or not, but congratulations on the award from the president.

26:49.116 --> 26:49.897
Well, thank you very much.

26:51.400 --> 26:56.969
There's so many other folks that do such good work, and I'm really humbled by that.

26:57.670 --> 26:59.072
It's not something I'd ask for,

26:59.390 --> 27:06.463
certainly accepted on behalf of all the other providers and my family and all, so I really appreciate you acknowledging that.

27:07.355 --> 27:10.219
I want to rewind because I put down here on my notes real quick.

27:10.600 --> 27:16.168
The unit you were assigned to at Ballad, the 332nd, was actually the original Tuskegee Airmen, right?

27:16.188 --> 27:20.514
Yeah, the home unit is the original Tuskegee Airmen unit, the 332nd.

27:20.934 --> 27:23.879
And, you know, we were called the Red Tail Medics.

27:23.899 --> 27:31.049
And that goes back to World War II where the Tuskegee Airmen would provide fighter support for the bombers over Germany.

27:31.389 --> 27:31.810
And they would

27:32.043 --> 27:41.633
They painted the tails on their aircraft red so the bomber pilots would know that the red tail pilots were there supporting them and protecting them.

27:41.653 --> 27:45.898
And we actually had some of those pilots come to Balad and visit while we were there.

27:45.918 --> 27:46.658
It was very special.

27:47.359 --> 27:52.625
The movie Tuskegee Airmen is one of my favorite movies of World War II, as a matter of fact.

27:52.645 --> 27:53.746
Thank you for visiting with us.

27:53.766 --> 27:57.129
The time goes by too fast and your service for your country.

27:57.149 --> 27:58.591
And we're glad to have you here.

27:58.611 --> 27:59.051
Appreciate it.

27:59.171 --> 27:59.772
Thank you, Tom.

28:00.899 --> 28:08.729
Dr. Jeff Huffman heard the call to serve from the President of the United States, and instead of just hearing it, he acted on it.

28:08.749 --> 28:10.271
So he was there serving.

28:10.971 --> 28:12.393
Lives were saved.

28:12.413 --> 28:14.135
I can't think of a higher calling of service.

28:14.155 --> 28:16.659
We salute Dr. Huffman and all veterans.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.220
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:18.341 --> 28:29.134
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:34.852 --> 28:36.863
Oh.
