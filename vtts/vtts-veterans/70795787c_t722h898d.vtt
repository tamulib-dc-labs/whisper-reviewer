Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:40.398 --> 00:41.580
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:41.999 --> 00:57.059
Last week, we introduced you to Coach Ray Adkins, who long before he coached the down of football, was involved in far more serious battles, like World War II's Battle of Okinawa, known as Operation Iceberg, near War's End in the Pacific Theater.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.425
Ray Adkins told of the death and other horrors of war that he witnessed.

01:01.675 --> 01:16.118
After the bomb was dropped and the Japanese surrendered aboard the USS Missouri in August of 1945, the occupation began and Ray Adkins unit was sent to China, where the fighting continued and some politics got in the way too.

01:16.719 --> 01:23.970
And then there's 38 years coaching high school football in Texas, the last 23 for the Gregory Portland Wildcats

01:23.950 --> 01:28.778
where he coached his son Marty, who would lead Darryl Royall's Longhorns in the mid-70s.

01:29.439 --> 01:37.972
And today, we will save plenty of time for Ray to brag about his grandchildren and his grandson, Drew Brees, quarterback of the New Orleans Saints.

01:38.493 --> 01:41.638
Welcome Coach Ray Adkins back to Veterans of the Valley.

01:41.905 --> 01:43.788
Ray, it's a pleasure to have you back again.

01:43.988 --> 01:46.432
We want to continue with your service in World War II.

01:47.033 --> 01:55.706
After the bombs were dropped in August of 1945, despite the heavy casualties that your unit took, you were assigned to occupational duty in China.

01:55.726 --> 01:58.230
I want you to talk about that, what that involved.

01:58.250 --> 02:06.322
I know that you couldn't go ashore because of the mine, so you actually had to offload the fishing boats, right, to get onshore to China.

02:06.723 --> 02:06.883
Right.

02:07.049 --> 02:08.451
They call them Chinese junkies.

02:09.111 --> 02:14.298
And they haul coal in there because there was some coal in the bottom when we got in there.

02:14.858 --> 02:17.602
Probably about 30 or 40 of us in one of those boats.

02:18.182 --> 02:24.290
And it was a little town called Tsingtao, right on the border of China.

02:25.652 --> 02:28.215
Tsingtao and Tsingwongtao, and that was another one.

02:28.695 --> 02:34.322
But we kind of rendezvoused there, and then we got on a train, and it was...

02:34.893 --> 02:36.475
Kind of like a military train, really.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.099
The tracks wasn't any wider than three feet.

02:40.181 --> 02:41.703
But anyway, it was like a boxcar.

02:42.023 --> 02:42.284
Right.

02:42.384 --> 02:43.285
And you could see out.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.530
And so they filled up the boxcars with us.

02:46.550 --> 02:49.234
And we traveled several hours.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.797
And then we got to Tientsin, China.

02:51.817 --> 02:55.683
And Tientsin, China at that time was about three million population.

02:55.703 --> 02:56.524
Wow.

02:56.544 --> 03:02.132
And we were sent there to tell the Japanese or get them to understand that the war was over.

03:03.108 --> 03:05.573
because they didn't have any way of knowing that the war was over.

03:06.335 --> 03:12.327
And also to repatriate the Japs back to Sasabu, Japan.

03:13.329 --> 03:20.323
So when we got there, I can remember two or three instances, but one night we were in this school.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.504
and they're in China and in Tientsin.

03:24.664 --> 03:28.108
And we heard these here clicking them, you know, down.

03:28.508 --> 03:32.132
Boy, those Japanese had them boots on and they were coming down the hallway.

03:32.152 --> 03:37.899
And we all slid in this room because we knew they, you know, I mean, they might open fire on us any time.

03:39.220 --> 03:39.861
And they did.

03:40.201 --> 03:45.948
And of course, we had some more Marines killed there and some more Japanese killed there.

03:45.968 --> 03:49.652
But the old British barracks is where we had our compound.

03:50.037 --> 04:03.694
And it had about 12 foot high and it was about, I'd say two and a half feet thick with big high rocks up there and then that wire on the top and big iron gates at the opening.

04:03.714 --> 04:08.200
But I spent probably about four to five months there.

04:08.400 --> 04:15.409
And so while we were there, of course, there's some of the things it's too hard to tell.

04:16.931 --> 04:17.432
I'll tell you.

04:18.152 --> 04:18.593
Yeah.

04:19.028 --> 04:25.495
Anyway, I like to tell this story because I didn't have it before.

04:27.017 --> 04:32.443
Hugh Tao and I decided that we wanted to go to church.

04:33.504 --> 04:43.015
And we hadn't been out of the compound much, but you had to be careful because these rickshaw men sometimes worked for some of these people that wanted to rob you.

04:43.035 --> 04:45.278
And they would take you because you didn't know how to get back.

04:46.099 --> 04:49.002
You know, maybe two miles down into Tientsin.

04:49.471 --> 04:59.262
And they had different compounds, they called them, the British and the White Russian and every different nationality, the Indians and everything.

04:59.823 --> 05:03.206
I mean, they had different compounds for each one.

05:03.226 --> 05:10.455
And you could tell where each one of them lived because they had different lawns, different houses, and everything like that.

05:11.075 --> 05:18.043
But we got down there and we went to that church.

05:18.243 --> 05:19.944
And it was huge.

05:19.964 --> 05:23.688
And so it really stayed in my mind ever since.

05:24.528 --> 05:25.829
Anyway, we went in there.

05:25.849 --> 05:32.375
Of course, they had all different languages, but they sang songs in different languages, but they all had the same tune.

05:33.296 --> 05:38.620
And we were sitting behind these two good-looking girls about halfway up there.

05:39.301 --> 05:44.045
And we knew they couldn't understand us, but in the end, I'll tell you about that.

05:44.485 --> 05:47.828
But anyway, up here on this stage, they had three...

05:48.483 --> 06:10.018
I was wondering how they were going to preach to everybody you know how they were going to talk. So they had these uh three pretty good sized houses well I'd say about four I mean about eight by tens and uh so they opened up this first house and uh they didn't find Jesus anywhere the pictures or nothing or the Bible

06:10.606 --> 06:17.416
And they went back and they tore the house all the way down to show everybody in the audience, probably about 2,000 people there.

06:17.436 --> 06:24.127
And so they found Jesus, dusty and all that, the Bible and everything, in the very back of the house.

06:25.228 --> 06:32.980
So the next house, that showed where these people kept Jesus in their hearts.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.465
And then they got the next one and they found it about middle way.

06:36.485 --> 06:39.550
So, you know, they were kind of iffy, you know, but they had it.

06:39.766 --> 06:48.096
And then the third house, they found him right at the, when he opened the front door, there in that house, there was the Bible, and there was a picture of Jesus and everything.

06:48.417 --> 06:52.862
So what their theme was is, where do you keep Jesus in your heart?

06:53.303 --> 06:56.246
Or, you know, in your house?

06:56.647 --> 07:04.657
And then we walked outside, and these two girls that were sitting in front of us, and I did, I corresponded with them a little bit after that.

07:04.677 --> 07:05.638
They were from India.

07:06.310 --> 07:10.118
And I guarantee you their daddy must have been seven foot tall.

07:10.138 --> 07:15.970
And they're those that wears all that stuff around their head and everywhere.

07:16.271 --> 07:19.457
But he shook hands with me and his old hand was twice as big as mine.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.185
But these girls could speak English.

07:23.205 --> 07:25.250
And so could their parents.

07:26.292 --> 07:26.412
Right.

07:26.729 --> 07:32.234
Anyway, it kind of made us feel like, you know, we've been talking about all this stuff, and they've been listening to it.

07:32.254 --> 07:33.535
But that was it.

07:33.575 --> 07:44.805
And then when we got back, and then I'll skip on down it, when we kind of helped explain why we had kill or be killed one-way ticket, why that was good.

07:45.526 --> 07:55.555
Well, Hugh Tao, after about four months there, he came and told me, he said, Ray, I'm about ready to be, I got my orders to be shipped back home, back to the States.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.904
And I thought, he said, do you have yours?

07:57.964 --> 07:59.727
I said, no.

08:00.408 --> 08:02.571
But I knew he had been in longer than I had.

08:02.591 --> 08:05.635
You know, I told you he was in the Aleutian Islands before he met up with me.

08:06.476 --> 08:12.203
And so, but during that two weeks, then about two weeks later, I got mine.

08:12.264 --> 08:15.328
But during that two weeks, I almost cracked up.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.632
You know, I mean, you're worried about, you know, because we're still getting guys killed.

08:19.573 --> 08:24.620
And still, you know, I mean, things were happening and you kind of tiptoed.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.082
You didn't really

08:26.332 --> 08:29.376
You know, you're always holding back, so to speak.

08:30.056 --> 08:39.928
And then I kind of put that after I started coaching, I really realized that, you know, if you're a player, if you're a football player and you're worried about getting hurt, you ain't worth a damn.

08:40.890 --> 08:51.422
And if you're a soldier or a fighter and you're worried about getting killed, you know, in a war, you're not much soldier.

08:51.442 --> 08:56.288
And so it really dawned on me then, that's what it did right at the end,

08:56.774 --> 09:04.867
And so I really, I think being in the Marines was a great lesson for me.

09:05.829 --> 09:09.255
And certainly we're going to talk about how it influenced you in your football coaching.

09:10.156 --> 09:13.161
I talked in the intro about how politics got in the way a little bit.

09:13.201 --> 09:23.338
And what I was referring to is that you had told me about how things got a little bit testy with the Russians during this occupation, because the Russians, who of course were our allies during World War II,

09:23.774 --> 09:26.317
they were there, U.S.

09:26.338 --> 09:29.922
soldiers were there to repatriate the Japanese and to send them back home.

09:30.443 --> 09:33.167
The Russians were not necessarily there for the same reason.

09:33.207 --> 09:39.075
When they would find the Japanese, a lot of times they would send them to Siberia, I guess, to be laborers for the Russians.

09:39.596 --> 09:46.726
And so you and the Russians were sort of on opposite sides of what to do with these Japanese, and it got a little testy there at times, right?

09:46.746 --> 09:47.346
Absolutely.

09:47.427 --> 09:53.595
I'd like to tell one more story that probably, while this was going on,

09:53.879 --> 10:06.178
The Russians wanted those Japanese, but there was another big compound, and when we'd take these Japs in, you know, when you'd find them and get them, we would take their guns away from them.

10:06.198 --> 10:10.945
And we had a pile of guns that was up 12 feet high, you know, in this compound.

10:11.726 --> 10:14.951
And we had these Japanese in that compound.

10:14.971 --> 10:20.920
And we would take them in these big old LSTs, you know, that the ramps would drop down.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.823
We'd take them, and that's where we'd take them in.

10:23.073 --> 10:35.224
But the Russians, they started taking everybody that had, you know, if they had both arms and both legs, they took them into Siberia to work until they died.

10:36.926 --> 10:52.860
But this, what happened was up in Peking, and now they call it Beijing, but Peking then, and our officers, we,

10:53.009 --> 11:18.156
clashed with you know pretty much clashed some with the Russians because the Russians didn't with they wouldn't let us you know do what we went there to do, and that's repatriate the Japs back to Japan. Right. And so they really and by and large but they broke what happened one night they bombed this or blasted this compound and so we had to let the Japanese have their guns back

11:18.845 --> 11:20.948
And so they took us out in a truck.

11:20.968 --> 11:21.769
Can you mind you there?

11:22.070 --> 11:25.134
I told you three million population would be kind of like Houston.

11:25.154 --> 11:33.526
And they took us out and dropped us off with two Japanese and one Marine about ever, you know, and gave our guns back.

11:33.826 --> 11:38.974
Here we are with the people we've been fighting against.

11:39.014 --> 11:40.155
You're standing shoulder to shoulder.

11:40.176 --> 11:45.163
Now they're with us, more or less fighting against the Russians.

11:45.563 --> 11:48.227
I knew, and when I got back, I told everybody,

11:48.511 --> 11:50.574
that Russia is who we're going to have problems with.

11:51.916 --> 11:57.444
And one day, I'm saying it right now, our problems are going to be with China or Russia.

11:57.464 --> 11:58.025
Right.

11:58.045 --> 11:58.466
Or both.

11:58.686 --> 12:02.111
So you foresaw the Cold War even back then.

12:02.552 --> 12:03.654
And that must have been strange.

12:05.176 --> 12:06.678
We want to get on to football.

12:06.698 --> 12:08.681
And you returned to the US.

12:08.721 --> 12:10.164
You were discharged.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.068
You enrolled at Southwest Texas in San Marcos.

12:13.088 --> 12:14.029
That's where you met, Virginia.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.493
You played football.

12:17.030 --> 12:17.811
You told me one story.

12:17.831 --> 12:20.034
You played with a lot of guys who had returned from the war.

12:20.254 --> 12:20.474
Yes.

12:20.875 --> 12:28.185
And you were playing against some teams of kids that were just coming out of high school who were just 18-year-old kids, and it was pretty much no contest, right?

12:28.205 --> 12:28.645
That's right.

12:30.067 --> 12:39.679
Well, I felt really sorry in a way because during my time there, see, a lot of these men that was in the war, and surprisingly, there was a lot of Marines there.

12:39.700 --> 12:44.306
Of course, our coaches, some of them, you know, we had five coaches that came back and had been in the war.

12:44.926 --> 12:45.467
And...

12:46.207 --> 12:51.535
One of them is really, probably everybody would remember him as Milton Jowers.

12:51.555 --> 12:57.483
And he was a tough, and he actually stayed in the Bobcat Hall with us, you know, where the athletes stayed.

12:57.984 --> 12:58.104
Right.

12:58.124 --> 12:59.266
He lived there.

12:59.286 --> 13:04.654
But it was, actually, I went there.

13:04.734 --> 13:13.266
When I got home from San Diego, California, and got back home, within a week, my coaches had rounded me up.

13:13.627 --> 13:13.767
Mm-hmm.

13:14.050 --> 13:22.762
And one of them named Bob Short, which went to Southwest Texas, he wanted me to go down and I had grown quite a bit.

13:22.802 --> 13:27.328
I didn't weigh but about 140 pounds in high school, but now I weighed 200.

13:28.229 --> 13:34.438
So they wanted me to go down there and see if I could give scholarship.

13:34.908 --> 13:36.990
I was working for the REA.

13:37.071 --> 13:43.738
I got a job with the REA there, and that's when they first started it, working for 40 cents an hour.

13:44.700 --> 13:50.667
But anyway, I went down and I worked out.

13:50.687 --> 13:52.929
There was only 33 boys got scholarships.

13:53.550 --> 14:01.860
We had to do jobs around the school, sweeping out and mopping up dressing rooms and everything.

14:02.144 --> 14:05.350
Anyway, that's my junior year, I met Virginia.

14:05.630 --> 14:06.431
Right.

14:06.451 --> 14:09.757
But I got a scholarship in football and track, which was good.

14:09.777 --> 14:10.979
I want to get you on the coaching road.

14:10.999 --> 14:17.390
Your first coaching job was just down the road from Bryan College Station in Rosebud as an assistant coach, right?

14:17.511 --> 14:17.971
That's right.

14:18.112 --> 14:24.483
And then sort of take us through just where were your stops after Rosebud?

14:24.503 --> 14:26.987
I know you were at Lomita, you were at Goldthwait, Freer.

14:27.811 --> 14:29.754
Where else before you got to Gregory Portland?

14:29.774 --> 14:31.035
What's the order of things here?

14:31.055 --> 14:39.547
Where I went was, I was at, my first job was at Rosebud as assistant coach in 1950.

14:40.188 --> 14:40.649
Okay.

14:40.669 --> 14:44.233
And then in 1951, I went to Lomita as head coach.

14:44.314 --> 14:46.537
Head coach for $2,700 a year.

14:46.717 --> 14:47.358
That's right.

14:47.378 --> 14:48.359
Plus $300 for coaching.

14:48.479 --> 14:48.860
That's right.

14:48.920 --> 14:49.180
Okay.

14:49.841 --> 14:52.705
Now, then we played Goldthwait, which had been

14:53.073 --> 15:02.427
UIL had been, they'd been suspended or kicked out of the UIL for a while before I ever got there, but they didn't have any equipment or anything.

15:03.088 --> 15:10.759
And so, but I decided that if I, I wanted to find out for sure if I would, if I could, you know, if I was in the right profession.

15:10.779 --> 15:11.220
Right.

15:11.240 --> 15:18.630
So I went to Goathewaite and the coaching school that year, they said, oh, Adkins, why would you want to go to a coach's graveyard?

15:19.311 --> 15:19.772
And, uh,

15:20.242 --> 15:24.572
I told them, I wanted to find out if I can really build a program.

15:25.094 --> 15:30.828
So we went there and we stayed there for three years and we did pretty well.

15:30.908 --> 15:34.757
We only got beat the second two years I was there, three.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.626
We actually did go to the state in the girls.

15:37.726 --> 15:39.368
I coached everything.

15:39.668 --> 15:43.874
So we went to the state in girls' basketball.

15:43.895 --> 15:45.757
You even toted the cheerleaders around, right?

15:46.418 --> 15:46.919
Yeah.

15:47.039 --> 15:52.126
Actually, a lot of the kids today wouldn't know, but we had leather headgears in high school.

15:52.527 --> 15:55.812
You could almost fold them up and put it in your hip pocket, kind of like a pair of gloves.

15:56.332 --> 15:57.654
And now they've got all this thing.

15:57.975 --> 15:58.956
It's really changed.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.099
And when you got tackled, you fell on grass burrs, right?

16:02.159 --> 16:06.424
Yeah, they used our field in the summer as a rodeo ground.

16:08.086 --> 16:10.429
I tell you, solid grass burrs.

16:11.110 --> 16:23.847
We had this big rolling machine they fixed and we tied toe sacks or burlap bags on it and would pull that and all them grass burrs would get in there and then we'd cut it off and put them in a pile there and burn them.

16:24.181 --> 16:26.885
And then we did that and got a lot of the grass birds out.

16:27.005 --> 16:27.686
But I felt sorry.

16:27.726 --> 16:29.529
Those old boys had places on them.

16:29.549 --> 16:33.655
But go back to Goldthwaite, we were there.

16:33.915 --> 16:37.901
And actually, they won the state championship right after I left.

16:37.941 --> 16:41.406
And we'd still be there if they could have paid anything.

16:41.847 --> 16:47.475
But I knew if I stayed in that profession, because by now, we had not only Virginia, we had three children.

16:47.815 --> 16:51.881
And we had Mina and Laura Sue and Marty.

16:52.702 --> 16:53.243
Right.

16:53.611 --> 16:58.897
So we started, either had to go north or south to get a little more money.

16:58.917 --> 17:03.944
So we went to Tidehaven, which is down close to Bay City, between Bay City and Palacios.

17:04.504 --> 17:08.830
And we stayed there, and then we went to Freer in 1960.

17:08.850 --> 17:14.817
We stayed there five years, and we only lost one district game in five years there.

17:15.638 --> 17:17.340
And then we went to Gregory Portland.

17:17.692 --> 17:22.839
And we stayed there 23 years and we thought, well, you know, we'll go there because they didn't have anything either.

17:22.899 --> 17:26.884
So I went to two schools where they had never won anything to speak of.

17:27.184 --> 17:28.326
Right, right.

17:28.346 --> 17:33.933
And so I was real happy that we went there because my superintendent, Mr. W.C.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.938
Andrews, which I owe a lot because he gave me the chance to come and be there.

17:38.599 --> 17:46.269
And he enjoyed going and making arrangements for these playoff games.

17:46.409 --> 17:46.669
Right.

17:46.835 --> 17:47.936
We had a great time.

17:48.577 --> 17:51.500
At Gregory Portland, 23 years there.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.943
3A state finals in 1971.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.488
You won 302 games, I think, in your entire coaching career.

17:58.508 --> 18:02.372
200 and something of those at Gregory Portland.

18:02.392 --> 18:06.716
And one of your quarterbacks in those 23 years was your son Marty.

18:06.756 --> 18:12.943
You had to be very proud to have coached your son because he went on to a great college career at the University of Texas.

18:13.092 --> 18:17.361
You know, Virginia and I are so proud of him, and we're out of all of our children.

18:17.602 --> 18:18.283
Sure, of course.

18:19.325 --> 18:29.627
You know, Marty was, you know, he grew up, he was little and small, but he developed and he started working, and he was a kid that he wanted to do.

18:29.747 --> 18:30.910
You had to be really careful.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.974
In fact, he taught me a lot in my coaching.

18:33.292 --> 18:41.121
Because I saw that if I, you know, a lot of coaches think they have to do something or tell a kid something or they're not doing their job.

18:41.601 --> 18:47.448
Well, I found out, don't tell a kid anything unless you know for a fact it's going to help him.

18:47.468 --> 19:01.864
Because Marty was the type of kid, and we'll just take the shot put, for instance, and if you told him anything, you know, I mean, he was already putting the shot out there 60 feet, you know, and he won the game.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.456
relays in Austin one year.

19:04.556 --> 19:10.060
We went to the Astrodome track meets and we went to big track meets.

19:10.361 --> 19:11.044
And so he

19:11.463 --> 19:35.749
but he did he was a good shot putter and a good discus thrower and he's a good football player and he's a pretty good basketball player and uh you know he he actually was a real good golfer yeah and uh but I told him you haven't got time for that son you gotta play football. But he was you know it's not you know. Sometimes a dad and a you know and his son you know doesn't work out, but Marty was

19:36.202 --> 19:47.157
he was good enough and I kind of put the squeeze on him and the parents from the other boys and the boys ratted around Marty and wanted, you know, they were

19:47.423 --> 19:50.867
Telling me, hey, put Marty in, you know, whenever I didn't have him in.

19:50.887 --> 19:55.753
He finished at Texas in 1975, the year before Coach Royall retired.

19:55.814 --> 20:06.687
And he was really, I guess, Texas' last great wishbone quarterback, an All-American quarterback in the wishbone offense, which was tough to do to become an All-American.

20:07.108 --> 20:09.010
So I know that you were very proud of that.

20:09.378 --> 20:11.640
You spoke of your other children.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.282
Yes, we have one right now.

20:14.342 --> 20:15.843
It's in med school.

20:15.944 --> 20:16.204
Right.

20:16.964 --> 20:21.408
And he, his second year, and that's Ryan Riyahi.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.730
That's our youngest daughter's boy.

20:23.910 --> 20:24.150
Right.

20:24.511 --> 20:29.235
He's probably six, three or four, and he's built like old Schwarzenegger.

20:29.455 --> 20:29.675
Right.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.676
He's very well.

20:30.756 --> 20:36.161
And then we have our son Marty's got the two girls, Angela and Tara.

20:36.481 --> 20:36.741
Right.

20:36.921 --> 20:38.963
And then our other...

20:39.500 --> 20:49.095
Our other, Mina, our oldest daughter, had two boys, and one of them is Drew Brees, and the other one is Reed Brees.

20:49.176 --> 20:52.200
And Reed played in the College World Series.

20:52.361 --> 20:54.624
He got a scholarship at Baylor in baseball.

20:55.125 --> 20:59.893
He played in the College World Series his senior year in Omaha.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.639
And so we're real proud of our kids, and they've all done well.

21:03.999 --> 21:04.200
Indeed.

21:04.220 --> 21:04.360
Indeed.

21:04.610 --> 21:11.743
Mina, you and Virginia, tragically, and Drew, lost her in August of 2009, just recently.

21:11.763 --> 21:21.722
But obviously, your grandson, Drew Brees, went to Westlake High School in Austin, won a state championship there his senior year.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.826
They went 16-0, a perfect season.

21:24.407 --> 21:25.048
And...

21:25.383 --> 21:38.937
Didn't get recruited by Texas or Texas A&M, and I'm sure that both the head coaches at the time, Coach McEvick and Coach Slocum, were sorry about that, but he went on to Purdue, and now he's the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints.

21:39.238 --> 21:50.509
Talk about, obviously, how proud you are of the success that he's had, not only on the field with the New Orleans Saints, but the things he's done off the field with his foundation, helping the recovery effort in New Orleans.

21:50.870 --> 21:52.291
I know you're very proud of this young man.

21:52.571 --> 21:53.112
Yes.

21:53.598 --> 21:57.268
He actually started this when he was still in Purdue.

21:57.288 --> 22:03.584
And he's got a street named after him in Purdue, Breezeway, while he was still there, which was great.

22:05.008 --> 22:07.675
But the biggest thing that Virginia and I...

22:08.009 --> 22:13.275
or most proud of our kids for is their generosity and helpfulness to others.

22:13.816 --> 22:20.024
Drew, he has this one where he has a dream, you know, a dream thing.

22:20.044 --> 22:27.553
And so these little kids that's handicapped or can't do much, they've sent in, you know, and said they wanted to go fishing with him.

22:27.753 --> 22:28.054
Right.

22:28.074 --> 22:29.015
So he'd take them.

22:29.055 --> 22:29.936
That was their dream.

22:29.956 --> 22:30.797
They wanted to go fishing.

22:30.877 --> 22:31.738
So he'd take them fishing.

22:31.758 --> 22:33.240
But to end up,

22:33.693 --> 22:38.321
We were on the elevator going up into the Superdome, one of the games.

22:38.461 --> 22:40.684
I believe it was Green Bay.

22:41.285 --> 22:44.290
And these three nuns were on the elevator.

22:45.051 --> 22:47.255
And so they were talking about Drew.

22:47.275 --> 22:52.824
And I told him, I said, I'm the grandfather, and this is their grandmother.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.928
So they said, you know what?

22:54.968 --> 22:56.630
We don't know anything about football.

22:56.911 --> 22:57.051
Mm-hmm.

22:57.368 --> 23:04.037
But we know one thing, we're so proud of Drew for what he does for this, you know, for the community of New Orleans.

23:04.258 --> 23:04.859
Right, right.

23:05.279 --> 23:09.685
We're running some pictures here as you talk, and we can look at those from your football career.

23:09.726 --> 23:13.471
That first one was you at Gregory of Portland, coaching Marty Adkins, your son.

23:13.891 --> 23:18.418
This was signing day when Marty signed with the University of Texas.

23:18.458 --> 23:22.544
That was back in the day when the head coach could actually be in the picture.

23:22.564 --> 23:26.329
And there's Marty with a picture that was signed by Coach Royall.

23:28.267 --> 23:28.988
Now we can slow down.

23:29.008 --> 23:35.234
Tell us about, this picture was taken when Marty was, I guess, inducted into the Hall of Honor at Texas.

23:35.254 --> 23:35.814
Is that right?

23:35.874 --> 23:39.658
Tommy Ingrams is on his right, and he's about 6'7".

23:39.738 --> 23:43.141
He was a tight end when they were there, and also his roommate.

23:43.161 --> 23:48.606
And yes, Marty got the Hall of Honor, University of Texas Hall of Honor award that night.

23:48.626 --> 23:55.573
And so, you know, Coach Royall there between Marty and I. And, you know, he's...

23:56.077 --> 23:59.162
He's always been, you know, a good friend of all of our family.

24:00.184 --> 24:01.626
Indeed.

24:01.646 --> 24:02.267
Let's move on.

24:02.487 --> 24:06.053
Now, this picture was just taken recently at Coach Royall's home.

24:06.073 --> 24:06.554
Is that right?

24:06.774 --> 24:07.235
That's right.

24:07.616 --> 24:17.111
Coach Royall doesn't live too far from where Marty does now in Austin, out on Bee Cave Road, going out north of Austin.

24:17.491 --> 24:17.892
Right.

24:17.912 --> 24:22.860
And so Marty had been telling me that he had been taking Coach Royall out to

24:23.077 --> 24:47.177
golf courses and they would ride around in golf carts. Coach Royall was always interested in golf. Oh sure. And Marty is a is a good golfer and he you know they have a lot in common there and then of course he played for Coach Royall and and uh it is they we we went over to his house and talked to he and his wife and uh and marty's actually taking him out to his ranch yeah and yeah you know right around chirokee

24:47.748 --> 24:50.912
Let's move on to... Now, I want to mention this.

24:50.972 --> 25:04.969
Just this fall, not too long ago, September 25th, 2009, as that shows, this is from the program at Gregory Portland where their football stadium was renamed Ray Adkins Wildcat Stadium.

25:04.989 --> 25:10.536
And you must have been very, very proud of that because just about all of your family was able to be there for that, right?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.920
I'm proud of that for my whole family.

25:13.940 --> 25:14.481
I think that

25:15.001 --> 25:25.373
If it hadn't been for the whole family, and Virginia in particular, you know, and of course Marty, all the children, you know, we supported each other and we needed each other.

25:25.954 --> 25:28.637
And it turned out, I thought it was great.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.759
And this is the whole family.

25:30.779 --> 25:35.905
This is our family except for Tara and her husband.

25:35.925 --> 25:41.211
And she's since that, she's had a great granddaughter.

25:41.495 --> 25:43.499
Now, these are two pictures that I put together.

25:43.519 --> 25:46.946
I thought these were great pictures of you and your grandson, Drew Brees.

25:46.966 --> 25:56.524
And he was, I think we just, you told us that he actually, this was on a Friday night, he actually had a game in Buffalo?

25:56.644 --> 25:57.847
Buffalo Bills, they played.

25:58.067 --> 26:00.111
Two days later, on Sunday.

26:00.462 --> 26:07.191
But they were able to fly him down to Corpus Christi, get in the car, come out to the stadium to be with you that night.

26:07.211 --> 26:12.899
And then they flew him back to catch the team playing the next day to go to Buffalo and then beat Buffalo on Sunday.

26:12.919 --> 26:13.600
Right.

26:13.620 --> 26:16.184
That was a heck of a trip for him, but I knew he was glad to be there.

26:16.204 --> 26:18.928
I was so glad they won the game because I didn't want those kids.

26:18.948 --> 26:20.310
You didn't want to be blamed for that.

26:20.931 --> 26:28.461
There's you in the middle and with Drew on the left as we're looking at the picture and his uncle, Drew.

26:29.015 --> 26:31.180
Marty Adkins on the right.

26:31.200 --> 26:36.633
Now, here's an official photograph of your grandson, autographed to you.

26:37.034 --> 26:37.836
Yes.

26:39.239 --> 26:41.123
Drew, he's given us a football.

26:41.143 --> 26:44.070
When he went this past year, he had the Pro Bowl.

26:44.354 --> 26:52.364
He had all of his team, and they won, but he had all of his team to sign the football, and you probably saw it there on the dresser.

26:52.404 --> 26:56.169
He put it in a case and sent it to us and everything.

26:56.189 --> 26:57.150
This is you in Virginia.

26:57.691 --> 27:00.594
It's a marvelous picture, and you all have been married 60 years.

27:00.615 --> 27:04.319
This lady here is absolutely a saint.

27:04.359 --> 27:05.741
She helps everybody.

27:06.322 --> 27:08.024
She never stops working.

27:08.164 --> 27:10.026
Of course, that's the German in her.

27:10.988 --> 27:11.949
Her name was Schultz.

27:12.209 --> 27:12.369
Exactly.

27:12.389 --> 27:12.910
Exactly.

27:13.025 --> 27:17.630
And I always said I was going to marry a Swede or a German or a Bohemian.

27:19.172 --> 27:24.238
And the reason that you all are in the Brazos Valley now, as a matter of fact, is because she is from New Baden.

27:24.258 --> 27:24.779
That's right.

27:24.799 --> 27:27.442
And so that's why you all are here right now.

27:27.462 --> 27:31.186
Most of my family had passed away or my parents and everything.

27:31.226 --> 27:35.411
And I had not many relatives still left around Brady.

27:35.712 --> 27:35.952
Right.

27:36.072 --> 27:39.937
So, you know, we bought a piece of land there while we were coaching at Freer.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.238
And that's where we are today.

27:41.258 --> 27:42.880
We built a nice log house.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.966
And it's really, for 21 years, we've been there now.

27:46.987 --> 27:47.287
Indeed.

27:47.748 --> 27:48.429
We're out of time.

27:48.549 --> 27:50.573
We could talk forever and ever, but we're out of time.

27:50.593 --> 27:55.282
But thank you for your service, and thank you very much for being here, Coach Adkins.

27:55.302 --> 28:00.531
Ray and Virginia Adkins met at Southwest Texas State after the war, and they have been married more than 60 years now.

28:00.872 --> 28:06.522
Her family, like we said, is from New Baden, and it's near there in Robertson County where they are retired on their ranch.

28:06.890 --> 28:19.678
We salute Coach Ray Adkins for not only his service on the battlefield in World War II, but for his passion of teaching young men life lessons of winning and losing that can only come from the battlefields of Texas high school football.

28:20.139 --> 28:22.444
For Coach Ray Adkins, I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:22.464 --> 28:25.951
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:25.971 --> 28:26.873
Tom, you did a

28:28.624 --> 28:38.003
[Music.]

28:38.003 --> 28:48.003
[Music.]

28:58.003 --> 29:02.003
[Music.]
