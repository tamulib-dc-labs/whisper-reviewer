00:13.659 --> 00:29.567
[Music.]

00:32.262 --> 00:34.305
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.386
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.728 --> 00:51.028
As important as any military detail of World War II, the military combat police providing personal protection for those conducting the war and from time to time dealing with those soldiers who through their behavior might undermine the unity of the mission.

00:51.268 --> 00:57.898
Well, Sergeant Tom Browning of Bryan was a member of one of the very first military combat police battalions of the U.S.

00:57.918 --> 00:58.118
Army.

00:58.638 --> 01:03.747
As a member of the 503rd and 504th MPs, he was quickly promoted.

01:03.968 --> 01:06.352
PFC, then Corporal, then Sergeant, then First Sergeant.

01:06.773 --> 01:20.477
And as a result of his duty was, in December of 1944, awarded the Bronze Star Medal for what his captain called meritorious service in connection with military operations against an enemy of the United States in France.

01:20.879 --> 01:33.173
Later, as a member of the 512th Military Police, where he was discharged from, Sergeant Browning had been attached to General George Patton's Third Army and pretty much followed Patton the duration of the war.

01:33.553 --> 01:37.638
Tom Browning, it is a pleasure to have you on the show of Veterans of the Valley.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.380
Let's talk about your growing up.

01:39.540 --> 01:44.986
You grew up in La Porte, and talk about how you got into the military service.

01:45.527 --> 01:47.269
Initially, it was with the cavalry, right?

01:47.629 --> 01:48.270
Yes.

01:49.031 --> 01:49.992
Well, I...

01:50.326 --> 01:56.414
I had been working around here, there, and yonder because jobs were hard to find.

01:57.596 --> 02:06.669
And I was in Corpus Christi and run out of job, run out of money.

02:06.689 --> 02:09.212
Here came a recruiting outfit into town.

02:11.251 --> 02:13.775
And talked with them.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.540
They bought me a cup of coffee.

02:18.143 --> 02:19.605
We had quite a conversation.

02:21.929 --> 02:25.355
Boy, I'd have been born real on a small farm.

02:25.876 --> 02:26.798
They had horses.

02:27.459 --> 02:28.561
Hey, that'd be fun.

02:29.603 --> 02:33.630
And, you know, for a year or two, it was fun.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.495
I really thought I knew a lot about horses.

02:36.515 --> 02:36.735
And

02:37.120 --> 02:42.225
I did, they had four legs, tail, other things like that.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.370
But there's a lot of things I had to learn about a horse.

02:46.930 --> 02:50.774
And I finally learned some of those things.

02:51.515 --> 03:04.849
And we had spent a couple of years along the border, along about that time of several organizations along the border.

03:05.352 --> 03:10.357
This was Troop A of the 12th Cavalry, and this was at Fort Brown of Brownsville.

03:11.558 --> 03:11.738
Yes, sir.

03:11.758 --> 03:19.847
And up the river, about 100 miles, was the second squadron of the 12th Cavalry, and that was at Fort Ringo.

03:20.827 --> 03:25.632
Well, the border was pretty well fortified along there.

03:26.213 --> 03:35.202
Of course, no one was trying to get into the United States then to cause any trouble.

03:35.222 --> 03:35.342
Right.

03:35.407 --> 03:41.373
because if a job came open, there was about 300 people wanting that job.

03:41.393 --> 03:42.754
Exactly.

03:42.774 --> 03:47.999
And so border crossings was not a problem.

03:49.300 --> 04:02.933
Anyway, we went on ahead, several maneuvers out in West Texas, first one place and another, and all of a sudden one day, you're reading in newspaper,

04:03.622 --> 04:11.512
All the news that was going on, the Japanese sank the USS Panache in the Yankees River.

04:13.274 --> 04:17.760
Lord God, I don't want to go to war in the Cavalry.

04:19.202 --> 04:23.688
That type of war is old-fashioned.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.769
What am I doing here?

04:26.352 --> 04:39.655
I contacted my dad, and I said, contact the commanding officer, tell him I'm needed on the farm, and I think I can get a discharge.

04:39.675 --> 04:43.282
Well, he did, and I got a dependency discharge.

04:43.302 --> 04:43.662
Yes, sir.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.409
But in doing so, I had joined the regular Army Reserve.

04:47.790 --> 04:48.090
Right.

04:48.965 --> 04:55.294
Well, in 1941, they called me back in, right back into the same organization.

04:56.415 --> 04:59.980
It was no longer in Port Brown.

05:01.402 --> 05:08.412
They had moved out to El Paso to... Fort Bliss?

05:09.533 --> 05:09.954
Yeah.

05:09.974 --> 05:10.274
Yes, sir.

05:10.615 --> 05:17.164
And there was a lot of organizations around El Paso at that time.

05:17.184 --> 05:17.925
Well...

05:19.576 --> 05:25.743
I looked around and I said, well, hey, I still don't want in this cavalry during war.

05:27.925 --> 05:30.228
Checked around, it was motorized cavalry there.

05:31.489 --> 05:33.091
I went over and talked with them.

05:34.573 --> 05:37.136
Oh, no, I said, we're full up.

05:38.137 --> 05:43.082
And I said, you've got good service, but we're full up.

05:43.102 --> 05:45.685
Well, I said, well, I need to do something.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.337
I don't want to go to war in this Cavalry, but here I am.

05:49.777 --> 05:56.571
I wrote a letter to Eddington Field and got an answer back.

05:56.591 --> 06:03.785
I said, well, if you've got a 90 IQ, we'll accept you and transfer here.

06:03.805 --> 06:07.673
Well, I had more than 90 IQ, and...

06:09.492 --> 06:14.757
first sergeant and the company commander, both of you, I was trying to get out of there.

06:14.777 --> 06:16.780
Well, I think everybody did, for that matter.

06:17.741 --> 06:28.071
He came to me and said, would you like to go over and form a military police outfit?

06:28.432 --> 06:29.453
Right.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.874
Well, give me the particulars.

06:30.914 --> 06:32.816
Well, he told me about it.

06:32.856 --> 06:36.640
He said it was 1st Cavalry Division Provisional Military Police Company.

06:38.041 --> 06:38.622
Okay.

06:39.715 --> 06:40.476
Sounds good.

06:41.297 --> 06:43.761
So I went to it.

06:43.781 --> 06:50.130
Well, here come Cavalrymen from everywhere.

06:50.170 --> 06:53.415
A nice bunch of men I'd been with as a soldier.

06:53.755 --> 07:03.730
And we farm and had different types of training and this, that, and the other.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.773
We went on for about 45 days.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.230
And they broke us up.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.292
Well, this didn't make sense.

07:10.312 --> 07:14.277
Send us right back to the same organization we came out of.

07:15.819 --> 07:20.526
First sergeant came to me and says, Browning, don't draw equipment.

07:20.546 --> 07:22.909
He says, you're being transferred.

07:22.929 --> 07:25.152
Good, where am I going?

07:25.172 --> 07:26.293
Fort Sam, Houston.

07:27.877 --> 07:33.022
So you went there and that was really the first contingent of MPs that formed Fort Sam Houston at that time.

07:33.342 --> 07:38.927
And you talked to me about the people that were recruited there were ages between 21 and 28.

07:39.088 --> 07:43.432
These were pretty sharp guys that had all applied to officer candidate school, right?

07:43.452 --> 07:49.838
Well, we found out that in order to be in this organization, you had to have at least 110 IQ.

07:50.238 --> 07:51.139
Yes, sir.

07:53.121 --> 07:57.445
Which is not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but

07:57.965 --> 07:59.707
you're no dumbbell either.

08:00.368 --> 08:09.678
And so we looked and said, hey, most of these guys are qualified for OCS.

08:10.539 --> 08:12.842
Well, a lot of them did, went off to OCS.

08:13.383 --> 08:18.949
They made officers, some of them came back to us, some of them went to other organizations.

08:18.969 --> 08:25.997
And at the same time, well, every place was hollering,

08:26.821 --> 08:31.909
This is a new organization for combat military police.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.531
Has never been heard of before.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.319
So they wanted them.

08:40.402 --> 08:44.608
Well, they had an opportunity to go to Iceland.

08:45.029 --> 08:47.192
You were going to be offered a promotion to go to Iceland.

08:47.212 --> 08:48.674
I was offered a promotion to go to Iceland.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.435
What did you think of that?

08:49.816 --> 08:51.799
Well, I...

08:53.247 --> 09:02.637
Having been born and reared in a country where the mean temperature was about 28 degrees, I didn't want to go to Iceland.

09:02.657 --> 09:03.237
I wonder why.

09:03.538 --> 09:11.086
And I think now, and I thought later, that it would have been a good place to fight World War II.

09:12.207 --> 09:17.112
But I don't think I could have stood the temperatures.

09:17.378 --> 09:26.096
Sergeant Browning, you were at Fort Sam Houston, as a matter of fact, on December 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was attacked and when the world changed.

09:26.577 --> 09:31.667
Talk about how it changed for you and sort of how you went from there and eventually got overseas.

09:32.529 --> 09:38.982
Well, they were forming several different combat forces.

09:40.008 --> 09:55.944
military police battalions in, because they had specific jobs, and they had never been formed before, so they were organizing different ones to be sent out.

09:55.964 --> 10:09.238
Well, that's the reason promotion was so rapid, and an entire company was sent off, and it formed this entire battalion.

10:10.231 --> 10:16.691
And another one, the contingent went off and formed.

10:16.711 --> 10:21.405
In fact, I was offered an opportunity to go out as a first sergeant on it.

10:22.280 --> 10:29.127
but I turned it down because it was going to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.

10:30.108 --> 10:33.771
And what I had heard about that was not good.

10:34.992 --> 10:37.094
It was a desolate place.

10:38.216 --> 10:49.907
Anyhow, the day that I heard that the

10:50.377 --> 10:52.320
Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor,

10:56.207 --> 11:10.191
I was the first sergeant, and I'd been inviting these boys out of the country, and I was married at the time, and I'd make friends with them and invite them to come and have an evening meal with me.

11:10.829 --> 11:16.817
Well, being a young man and married at that time, well, Sunday meant a day of bliss.

11:17.938 --> 11:25.888
And so we didn't know anything about this until after they came and visited us.

11:26.549 --> 11:37.883
Well, the following day, we were out on the rifle raids and we heard President Roosevelt declare the act of war.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.127
The day that would live in infamy is what he said.

11:40.808 --> 11:42.010
Let's move on.

11:42.211 --> 11:47.780
January the 1st, 1943, that was the day that you actually left Boston Harbor.

11:47.800 --> 11:53.670
That day we left Fort Sam Houston to go to Boston.

11:53.951 --> 11:55.213
And then you went?

11:55.463 --> 12:00.649
the route through the North Atlantic from Boston, that was some kind of a boat ride.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.852
That was the most treacherous boat ride.

12:03.753 --> 12:07.938
I understand that's the most treacherous body of water there is.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.662
You were on the USS Elizabeth C. Stanton at the time.

12:11.202 --> 12:12.043
Talk a little bit about it.

12:12.103 --> 12:15.988
Everybody got sick by the time they got to Scotland, right?

12:16.008 --> 12:23.277
It was so rough that I'd say that probably at least 90%

12:24.083 --> 12:27.047
But the people aboard ship were sick.

12:28.249 --> 12:36.761
And vomiting was something that was disagreeable even to think about.

12:36.781 --> 12:37.142
Indeed.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.464
Much less to even see.

12:39.125 --> 12:48.498
It was so rough that if you went to the mess hall to eat, the table may buckle up while you're sitting there.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.002
It was that rough.

12:51.961 --> 12:59.688
Turns out that the Elizabeth C. Stanton was the flagship of the convoy, and you were the senior NCO on the Stanton.

13:00.048 --> 13:07.555
And you eventually landed in Scotland, got onto a train, but you all really didn't know where you were going, what you were headed to.

13:07.575 --> 13:11.738
You knew that you were about to be involved in war, though, right?

13:11.758 --> 13:11.858
Yeah.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.140
We knew we were in England.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.983
We knew that war was inevitable.

13:17.603 --> 13:21.647
We were going to be a part of it, and that's all we knew at that time.

13:22.387 --> 13:26.072
And we went to, I believe it was called Pilgrim Hall.

13:26.652 --> 13:31.919
How I got this name, I don't have any idea of what the name stood for.

13:32.980 --> 13:43.694
I remember one of the gentlemen there that I met carried me to a business of a church.

13:45.456 --> 13:48.260
And he said, this church is 400 and some odd years old.

13:48.801 --> 13:50.723
I said, y'all don't have anything that's old, do you?

13:51.344 --> 13:58.511
Well, if we did, it was built by the Indians because we weren't even discovered by then.

13:58.531 --> 13:58.952
Anyhow.

13:59.612 --> 14:04.617
I'm going to show you a picture here as we're looking at it on the screen.

14:04.637 --> 14:07.540
And if you can recognize that picture.

14:07.560 --> 14:12.825
This is you, I believe, on the right on this picture.

14:12.845 --> 14:14.427
What can you tell us about that photograph?

14:15.508 --> 14:17.510
That is Toul, France.

14:18.391 --> 14:18.651
Uh-huh.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.048
Yes, that's me sitting there.

14:23.809 --> 14:32.117
With one of your war buddies in France.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.358
Very good.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.861
That's where we had quite a battle.

14:37.101 --> 14:37.362
Right.

14:37.682 --> 14:44.248
And several things of interest happened along about that time.

14:44.628 --> 14:49.853
There was one thing we did is

14:50.525 --> 14:58.435
combat police was that we had to be the last-ditch stand for Army headquarters.

14:58.455 --> 15:07.186
We had to maintain the entire MSR, the main supply route.

15:09.169 --> 15:18.220
Things moved so fast there for a period of time that we actually had to have aircraft deliver gasoline to it.

15:18.453 --> 15:24.462
because those tanks were moving so fast that the trucks couldn't keep up with us.

15:25.384 --> 15:33.115
Well, prisoners were here, there, and moved.

15:33.636 --> 15:34.538
Here, there, and moved.

15:34.858 --> 15:36.280
It was just that fast.

15:38.884 --> 15:47.177
Another thing that happened in France, a lot of these people who had been shot down,

15:48.524 --> 15:53.128
The French underground would bring them and turn them over to us.

15:53.148 --> 16:02.698
The first thing they had to do was to go to Army headquarters to be interrogated, grilled, and whatever, and then sent back.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.124
And you had lots of respect for these people.

16:09.144 --> 16:10.325
They had done a great job.

16:10.705 --> 16:11.046
Indeed.

16:12.027 --> 16:12.867
Indeed.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.789
Looking at another photograph now.

16:14.829 --> 16:16.091
I'm going to show it to you.

16:16.111 --> 16:17.552
This is you and two of your...

16:17.988 --> 16:20.779
two of your army buddies sitting on a jeep.

16:21.682 --> 16:28.588
Can you recall, I'll let you take a closer look at it yourself also, can you recall anything about that picture?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.098
Yeah, I can.

16:34.161 --> 16:46.152
I had a brother who was inducted into the Army, and my sister called and told me he was coming through the replacement depot in Fort Sam Houston.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.674
I knew all the first sergeants over there.

16:49.135 --> 16:49.895
I want to talk to him.

16:49.915 --> 16:55.461
When he comes in, send him over to me and show him what I got here.

16:55.481 --> 16:56.922
He came over and says,

16:58.977 --> 17:01.380
How about getting in here?

17:02.141 --> 17:03.142
Oh, absolutely not.

17:03.303 --> 17:03.683
No way.

17:05.185 --> 17:06.867
You go and find your place.

17:06.887 --> 17:08.489
I have control of this place now.

17:11.393 --> 17:12.034
Well, he did.

17:12.895 --> 17:25.812
He became a sergeant in an outfit that went through Italy and

17:26.703 --> 17:30.588
African, Italy, and come up through there.

17:31.269 --> 17:34.933
And I had written to him and told him I was being relieved of my duties.

17:35.714 --> 17:43.825
And I had written and told him to meet me in Brenner Pass.

17:45.447 --> 17:48.290
Get a pass and meet me in Brenner Pass.

17:48.310 --> 17:53.537
Well, I said I was being relieved of my duties, so I wasn't

17:54.125 --> 17:59.590
aware of what was taking place, transfers of troops coming on.

18:00.611 --> 18:00.731
Right.

18:00.751 --> 18:04.014
Well, I went to Brenner Pass, spent the day there waiting for him.

18:04.354 --> 18:05.576
He didn't show up.

18:05.596 --> 18:16.085
I got back to the company, and my mail said, we're in Hall, Germany.

18:17.386 --> 18:19.508
I told my driver, I said, it's 9 o'clock.

18:20.129 --> 18:21.330
I said, sleep fast.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.002
We're going to Hall, Germany.

18:23.062 --> 18:24.784
Get up here at 5 o'clock in the morning.

18:24.824 --> 18:26.046
We're going to Hall, Germany.

18:26.567 --> 18:27.008
Yes, sir.

18:27.028 --> 18:30.713
And that was my brother and my driver on that Jeep.

18:31.134 --> 18:34.038
You were the person on the left on that last picture we saw.

18:34.579 --> 18:39.546
I want to, picture-wise, if we can, got another photograph coming up right now.

18:39.566 --> 18:40.327
We'll just look at that.

18:40.367 --> 18:47.858
That's another photograph of you on the left with some other of your buddies, a young military police soldier there.

18:48.530 --> 18:53.697
I want to talk about you being attached to the headquarters company of General Patton.

18:54.618 --> 18:58.924
The first time that you came in contact with General Patton, you told me a story.

18:58.944 --> 19:03.169
You were a little bit surprised at what he sounded like, right?

19:03.189 --> 19:03.870
Well, yes.

19:05.172 --> 19:14.284
I had worked off and known out in the oil fields and anticipated, well, I knew that these oil drillers

19:15.310 --> 19:22.938
Oh, man, they were big, burly brutes, and so was Patton.

19:24.219 --> 19:28.163
They had a voice to match their appearance.

19:29.825 --> 19:40.356
When the Third Army was formed in Pilgrim Hall in England, Patton assembled all the

19:41.213 --> 19:51.762
officers and the NCOs of the first three grades and explained to them what he had planned for us to do.

19:54.365 --> 20:09.718
When he got up there to speak and he had this pistol on his side and he looked so burglar and he had a sweet, almost a feminine type voice you ever heard and the tittering and tattering went on.

20:10.373 --> 20:13.718
because we all had suspected the same thing.

20:14.119 --> 20:16.703
And of course he had quite a reputation.

20:21.811 --> 20:26.658
I will have to admit that he carried off what he said he would do.

20:27.099 --> 20:27.780
Indeed.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.202
We're looking at another photograph now.

20:29.222 --> 20:30.164
This is you in the middle.

20:30.204 --> 20:34.110
Just some other photographs from your World War II experience.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.873
What was following Patton like?

20:35.913 --> 20:38.777
What are some of your most vivid memories of

20:39.297 --> 20:48.230
being in the military combat police unit that was actually attached directly to the headquarters company of General Patton.

20:48.891 --> 20:50.293
What are some of your memories of him?

20:50.793 --> 20:54.078
Well, I'll have to admit, I was in war.

20:54.338 --> 20:55.921
I knew I was in war.

20:55.941 --> 21:01.388
I knew that there were people who were after me, but I was after people also.

21:02.610 --> 21:03.972
I felt that

21:09.301 --> 21:10.322
What am I doing here?

21:13.065 --> 21:15.328
Things are not as bad.

21:15.828 --> 21:22.135
If you can see things happening and know what's happening, why can't you evade them?

21:22.155 --> 21:24.939
Okay, that's going to be my policy.

21:24.959 --> 21:35.470
Because I remember when I was in the second grade in school that I remember reading something in the spelling book.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.873
It said, good, better, best, never let it rest.

21:38.326 --> 21:41.329
till the good is better, and the better, best.

21:41.349 --> 21:44.272
Well, that's the way I tried to make things.

21:46.314 --> 21:52.860
When things got to where it was developed to where it looked like it was going to be bad, I would try to make it good.

21:53.721 --> 21:55.883
And if I could make it good, it could be made better.

21:56.684 --> 21:59.247
And that's where I lived, trying to make it.

22:00.208 --> 22:07.455
And that's... Fortunately, I think I was successful in some respects because...

22:07.891 --> 22:11.898
I had a wonderful company and they respected me.

22:11.918 --> 22:12.239
Indeed.

22:12.820 --> 22:26.766
The photograph that we're looking at now, I know you know the photograph, this is General Eisenhower inspecting some of your troops and you are the military police standing directly to the left behind General Eisenhower.

22:26.786 --> 22:31.755
What do you remember about how that meeting came about?

22:33.541 --> 22:36.626
It was quite a funny thing.

22:37.928 --> 22:39.370
Patton didn't want to be stopped.

22:39.390 --> 22:46.621
Patton wanted to go on through Germany and go on into Russia.

22:49.124 --> 22:52.970
This was something that was quite, everybody knew it.

22:54.472 --> 23:02.805
Well, we had gone up to the Elbe River and being right with Army headquarters, well,

23:03.511 --> 23:08.296
There was a building there that had a large platform paid out in front of it.

23:09.036 --> 23:13.621
I saw a fellow up there that, hey, I haven't seen his uniform.

23:14.221 --> 23:15.122
Well, who that is?

23:15.983 --> 23:23.951
And, of course, I had seen all the uniforms that was basically was in the Allied forces.

23:23.971 --> 23:26.834
And so I went up and I introduced myself to him.

23:27.794 --> 23:29.196
And he's an American.

23:30.097 --> 23:32.539
He grabbed my hand, shook it.

23:32.789 --> 23:35.913
He said, Ruski, he hugged me on both sides.

23:37.115 --> 23:43.203
Well, I realized what we had done, and so had Eisenhower.

23:43.583 --> 23:44.865
Right.

23:44.885 --> 23:51.353
We had gone into Russian territory and was not supposed to be there.

23:51.373 --> 23:55.118
So we were ordered back.

23:56.971 --> 24:05.826
And Patton says, I want you to get up 20 men with clean uniforms.

24:05.846 --> 24:08.630
I want to have Eisenhower's coming.

24:08.650 --> 24:15.622
I want to put on an honor program for him.

24:15.642 --> 24:19.048
Well, I found 14 men with clean uniforms.

24:19.068 --> 24:20.370
And that was a difficult task.

24:22.133 --> 24:22.253
Right.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.696
And that's what that picture that we saw before.

24:24.736 --> 24:27.180
We're looking at a picture right now, a much more recent picture.

24:27.200 --> 24:37.113
I think this was taken just a year or so ago of the 61st reunion, and you're cutting a cake.

24:37.814 --> 24:39.035
What were we looking at there?

24:39.075 --> 24:40.177
What was that reunion?

24:40.517 --> 24:45.704
Well, we mentioned this other picture.

24:45.764 --> 24:50.350
One of the things that happened to me was I now walked up to me and said,

24:51.173 --> 24:52.855
What Cavalry out there are you out of?

24:53.075 --> 24:54.597
Right.

24:54.617 --> 24:59.283
Well, I told him, Troop A-12 Cavalry, sir.

25:00.244 --> 25:06.992
Well, that was just, we were so busy after that, my company commander didn't get to ask me about it.

25:07.393 --> 25:11.638
So he did ask me later after the reunion why he had asked me that.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.600
So I explained it to him then.

25:14.201 --> 25:19.948
But the Cavalry actually had formed this...

25:21.312 --> 25:27.946
organization, the first 504th Military Police Battalion that had formed.

25:28.567 --> 25:32.294
The contingent was taken out of the cavalry.

25:32.314 --> 25:36.503
Well, I was the only cavalryman they could find that was still alive.

25:37.343 --> 25:40.967
that knew anything about the formation of it.

25:40.987 --> 25:42.690
Well, they wanted all this information.

25:43.771 --> 25:56.807
So they paid my way to Fort Lewis, Washington, and I said, I can't go, I can't see, and I'll have to use my walker.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.673
I had no problem.

26:01.693 --> 26:05.798
My son came and said, well, Dad, if you go,

26:07.533 --> 26:10.317
I'll pay my way and go out there, will you?

26:10.357 --> 26:12.180
Okay, that's fine.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.125
I'll go.

26:16.726 --> 26:19.830
As Art called them, ask them if I can bring my walker.

26:21.232 --> 26:23.335
Oh, no, we'll push you around in a wheelchair.

26:24.737 --> 26:27.381
Well, I never rode in a wheelchair so much all my life.

26:27.597 --> 26:28.338
I bet that's right.

26:28.578 --> 26:30.882
We're running out of time, Sergeant Browning.

26:30.922 --> 26:38.834
I know that your unit also was involved in the liberation of Berlin towards the end of World War II, and we want to thank you for your service.

26:38.854 --> 26:47.466
I wish we had more time to talk about your remarkable tour of duty, but most I'll salute you and thank you very much for your service, and we appreciate you being here.

26:47.486 --> 26:49.209
Thank you, Sergeant Browning.

26:49.229 --> 26:50.010
Well, thank you.

26:50.243 --> 26:56.408
Tom Browning served more than four years in the Army from February 1941 to September 1945.

26:56.829 --> 27:04.795
He supervised the work of some 518 soldiers while serving in northern France, the Ardennes, Rhineland, Normandy, and Central Europe.

27:05.196 --> 27:09.019
A proud resident of the Brazos Valley and a proud veteran of World War II.

27:09.519 --> 27:13.302
We salute Sergeant Tom Browning and all veterans for their service.

27:13.943 --> 27:17.086
And we thank also our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:17.126 --> 27:19.828
And please be sure to read more stories of veterans

27:19.808 --> 27:22.771

27:26.015 --> 27:31.178
