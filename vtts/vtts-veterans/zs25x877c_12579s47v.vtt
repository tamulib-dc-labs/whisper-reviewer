00:35.239 --> 00:38.777
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.258 --> 00:40.180
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.970 --> 00:46.476
Robert Fliedner had pretty much decided that the Army didn't want him after his high school graduation in 1940.

00:46.596 --> 00:51.741
You see, he had tried to enlist twice, but poor eyesight disqualified him both times.

00:52.202 --> 00:53.383
But then after the U.S.

00:53.443 --> 01:06.977
got involved in World War II, after Pearl Harbor, well, his eyesight must have improved because he was drafted first to sign the limited service and then general service and then to duty in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war.

01:07.261 --> 01:19.253
Robert Fliedner built stuff, camps for incoming infantry, sewer lines for those camps, tank farms to store gasoline, and he maintained gasoline pump stations that pumped fuel to the front lines.

01:19.753 --> 01:28.121
His overseas duty started in England, then landing at Normandy's Utah Beach, and it ended more than two years later at Bataan in the Pacific.

01:28.702 --> 01:34.888
Please welcome Robert Fliedner of College Station, one of those rare World War II veterans who served on both fronts.

01:35.273 --> 01:38.861
Robert, it's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley and to tell your story here.

01:39.322 --> 01:40.746
You're a New Jersey guy.

01:40.766 --> 01:43.673
You graduated from high school in 1940, I know.

01:43.693 --> 01:44.675
That's correct.

01:45.216 --> 01:48.885
But you tried to enlist, but they just said you couldn't see well enough, right?

01:48.905 --> 01:49.426
That's right.

01:49.446 --> 01:50.609
That was my problem.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.215
I wore glasses and had...

01:54.798 --> 01:57.485
what they considered to be too poor eyesight.

01:57.505 --> 02:00.313
So they said, thanks, but no thanks.

02:01.837 --> 02:03.481
But then you were drafted in 1943.

02:03.501 --> 02:06.710
1941, December, Pearl Harbor.

02:07.091 --> 02:08.635
What do you remember about hearing the news?

02:08.655 --> 02:09.297
Where were you?

02:09.547 --> 02:25.494
I was in the living room of my parents' home, and it was mid-afternoon, and I was going to go out with some of my buddies, and all of a sudden, they broke into the program to announce the news at Pearl Harbor.

02:26.316 --> 02:29.181
And, of course, we were stunned.

02:30.202 --> 02:34.710
None of us really realized how it would affect our lives.

02:34.876 --> 02:36.658
1943, though, you were drafted.

02:36.678 --> 02:43.185
You went to Fort Dix initially and then to Fort Niagara, where all the people there were pretty much limited service like yourself.

02:43.325 --> 02:44.246
That's right.

02:44.266 --> 02:53.675
And at that time, limited service meant that you were going to stay in your army area, which was at that time centered around New York City.

02:53.695 --> 02:53.936
Right.

02:53.996 --> 02:56.478
They just tried to find something for you to do.

02:56.538 --> 02:57.860
You were a draftsman.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.280
That's right.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.862
That was your training at the time.

02:59.882 --> 03:02.525
So they were looking for something to go along with your training.

03:02.545 --> 03:02.925
Correct.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.527
Right, right.

03:04.547 --> 03:18.139
But then they decided to reassign that post up in Niagara, and they decided that they were going to re-evaluate all of you and decide whether to kick you out of the Army or to make you general service, right?

03:18.279 --> 03:19.783
That's the way it worked.

03:19.763 --> 03:22.127
I don't know anyone that got kicked out.

03:22.708 --> 03:25.052
We all magically passed the physical.

03:25.212 --> 03:29.600
There was a war going on, so you passed the physical, and then you were a general.

03:30.060 --> 03:42.481
You went to Camp Ellis, 368th General Service Engineering, and that was construction is what that was all about because your MOS was as a draftsman, so that kind of went hand in hand, right?

03:42.501 --> 03:45.707
That suited their needs at that time.

03:45.727 --> 03:46.007
Right.

03:46.713 --> 03:49.477
You learned how to shoot a .50 caliber machine gun, right?

03:49.618 --> 03:50.639
For no reason at all.

03:50.659 --> 03:53.925
That was the only Army school I ever went to.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.591
All the rest of it was on-the-job training.

03:57.771 --> 03:58.252
That's right.

03:58.432 --> 04:00.736
And you went to that school, what, up near Chicago?

04:00.776 --> 04:01.958
Near Chicago, right.

04:02.158 --> 04:02.518
Right.

04:02.538 --> 04:05.263
And that's the only time you ever came in contact with a .50 caliber.

04:05.403 --> 04:05.704
Yeah.

04:05.724 --> 04:10.051
From there on in, I never saw it or never handled it again.

04:10.371 --> 04:10.631
Right.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.214
Went on to Camp Shanks.

04:12.565 --> 04:18.532
And then we're pretty soon going to go over to Europe and they gave you a 24 hour pass to say goodbye to your family.

04:18.612 --> 04:19.954
What do you remember about that?

04:20.595 --> 04:31.128
Well, I can remember getting home and I had not told my parents what was going on.

04:32.069 --> 04:37.656
And of course, they were kind of shocked and of course, then delighted to see me.

04:37.676 --> 04:40.159
But they realized that

04:40.949 --> 04:42.732
I was going someplace.

04:42.832 --> 04:58.654
And of course, I don't know what thoughts my dad had because he served in France in the AAF in World War I. So I can imagine or try to imagine some of his thoughts and visions.

04:59.309 --> 05:05.337
probably had an idea of where his son was headed and the perils that his son might come in contact with.

05:05.357 --> 05:05.898
That's right.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.340
That's right.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.882
Let's talk about going over.

05:08.942 --> 05:18.595
I'm always fascinated by the stories because it seems like every soldier who went to the European theater has some sort of a story about their trip over.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.220
And you were on the British boat called the Scythia.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.262
Correct.

05:23.502 --> 05:26.987
Talk about that trip over from New York, right?

05:27.007 --> 05:28.489
It was loaded from

05:28.823 --> 05:32.629
keel to open decks with soldiers.

05:32.849 --> 05:39.118
In fact, where I was billeted was five decks down.

05:39.178 --> 05:41.121
We were below the waterline.

05:41.141 --> 05:45.648
But there were two open decks that had soldiers on them the whole trip.

05:45.668 --> 05:46.790
And they never came in.

05:47.851 --> 05:51.156
So it was quite an experience.

05:51.497 --> 05:55.763
Fortunately, we didn't meet any really rough weather.

05:55.783 --> 05:58.527
But I know my own experience was...

05:58.878 --> 06:03.906
First three days, I didn't feel too well, but we got over it.

06:04.347 --> 06:07.171
When you're talking about packed in, you're talking about really packed in.

06:07.191 --> 06:10.436
You told me about sort of sleeping in a makeshift hammock.

06:11.217 --> 06:18.068
For a couple of nights, I tried sleeping in a hammock slung from the ceiling, and I could reach out and touch eight other men.

06:18.990 --> 06:26.742
And every spot on the tables we ate off of, underneath the tables, every inch was covered with a body.

06:27.093 --> 06:31.317
But we're going to find out later on exactly how resourceful Robert Fliedner was.

06:31.818 --> 06:35.642
So you eventually found your way up to the open air deck, right?

06:35.682 --> 06:37.984
Because things were getting kind of nasty down there.

06:38.004 --> 06:42.689
They were a little bit on the smelly side.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.693
That many men together and not many latrines and all that.

06:46.733 --> 06:47.554
It can be that way.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.414
Only one.

06:48.434 --> 06:54.621
And by the time morning would come, there were several inches of water slopping around in it.

06:54.761 --> 06:55.041
Right.

06:55.392 --> 07:02.927
You were a 19-year-old kid now, a 19 or 20-year-old kid who hadn't been away from home very much.

07:03.488 --> 07:04.490
But what were your thoughts?

07:04.550 --> 07:06.775
I mean, you're heading off to war.

07:07.075 --> 07:08.678
Were you afraid?

07:08.819 --> 07:11.464
No, I don't think I was afraid.

07:13.087 --> 07:16.995
You didn't know what tomorrow would bring.

07:17.296 --> 07:20.839
you were in a group that everybody was the same.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.220
Right.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.522
Everybody literally in the same boat.

07:24.163 --> 07:24.863
That's right.

07:24.883 --> 07:26.025
That's right.

07:26.045 --> 07:30.109
For 12 days, you went over, you landed at Bristol, England.

07:30.649 --> 07:34.052
And then to sort of take us from there after your landing, they transferred you.

07:34.253 --> 07:38.437
After Bristol, they took us up to a small English town called Buxton.

07:39.398 --> 07:43.742
And we were housed in what they call the townhouses up there.

07:43.992 --> 07:51.200
and our task was to build this camp for the infantry coming over months and months later for the invasion.

07:52.001 --> 07:55.364
Of course we really weren't aware of that at the time.

07:56.666 --> 08:02.512
So we often call ourselves the strong back, weak mind division.

08:02.853 --> 08:10.641
I worked initially on a concrete gang where we were

08:11.127 --> 08:35.008
pouring floors for some of the buildings that we would erect and then I was assigned the task of putting in a sewer line to a stream that was about 2,500 feet long and we had a digger that was going to dig the trench for us but we hit a Roman drain

08:35.208 --> 08:38.152
And that broke the teeth of the digger.

08:40.576 --> 08:46.444
Because there were only one company of engineers there, and the infantry arrived.

08:47.085 --> 08:53.455
So every morning I would get a platoon of infantrymen, and it was up to me to put them to work.

08:53.475 --> 08:56.039
Their non-coms disappeared.

08:56.059 --> 08:59.123
And so after the digger broke down,

08:59.592 --> 09:04.300
We had about a thousand feet of trench to go, and so I gave them a choice.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.742
Pick a shovel, fellas.

09:06.183 --> 09:06.764
Here we go.

09:08.026 --> 09:12.934
And this was a trench that had to be big enough to set down the piping.

09:13.115 --> 09:20.487
Yeah, we were using clay tile, bell clay tile, which was...

09:20.888 --> 09:24.056
a common product in England at that time.

09:25.099 --> 09:31.374
And because water would get in the trench, we would have to do it in sections.

09:31.394 --> 09:36.788
We'd build like a earthen dam and then we could pump the water out and lay the tile

09:37.207 --> 09:39.691
And then move on to the next section.

09:39.711 --> 09:39.951
Right.

09:40.011 --> 09:41.533
Just leapfrog that way.

09:41.693 --> 09:42.314
Exactly.

09:42.334 --> 09:47.341
And this camp you were building, I think you said this was for infantry, new infantry that was coming over from the states.

09:47.562 --> 09:48.022
That's right.

09:48.062 --> 09:52.829
Who were going to be involved in the initial invasion of Normandy.

09:52.849 --> 09:53.370
That's right.

09:53.430 --> 09:54.031
That's right.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.331
Yeah.

09:55.092 --> 09:58.477
From there, you were taken up into the Welch Mountains.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.158
What was that about?

09:59.479 --> 10:05.307
Well, as D-Day got close, we were taken up.

10:05.472 --> 10:31.108
work on the camp stopped and we were taken up into the Welsh mountains to do some refresher training which consisted of marching and at that time they took away our M1 Garands and gave us battle salvage M1 carbines and mine was a mess when they put us out on the target range

10:32.236 --> 10:35.522
I never did find out where it was hitting.

10:35.542 --> 10:36.844
It never hit the target.

10:38.027 --> 10:48.646
So, of course, at that time, I swore to myself that if I had to, the first chance I'd get, I would exchange it for a grand.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.329
Right, right, right.

10:50.917 --> 10:57.426
It was about this time, I guess, that D-Day actually occurred, but you really didn't know about it yet because you were up in the mountains.

10:57.447 --> 10:59.049
You were pretty much in the boondocks, right?

10:59.069 --> 10:59.550
That's right.

10:59.610 --> 11:03.535
We were in the boondocks, and we probably didn't hear about it for a couple of days.

11:04.677 --> 11:06.219
D-Day was June 6th.

11:09.664 --> 11:19.759
Within a few days, however, they moved us down to a camp, a barbed wire enclosure,

11:20.093 --> 11:27.806
on the southern coast of England and we were there just a few days until they loaded us on a LST.

11:28.907 --> 11:39.505
Us as troops and of course with our bulldozers and road scrapers and trucks, all the heavy equipment that we had went with us.

11:39.525 --> 11:45.915
I want to go back to this encampment that you said, this barbed wire encampment where they held you.

11:46.638 --> 11:48.681
There's a lot of security involved in this time.

11:48.741 --> 11:58.215
One reason that it was a barbed wire encampment is they didn't want you communicating with the outside because people kind of knew what the war strategy was then.

11:58.435 --> 12:00.218
Yeah, right.

12:00.458 --> 12:10.232
They wanted to break any communication between the troops and outside because you never knew who was on the outside.

12:10.653 --> 12:12.375
I mean, there were German agents

12:12.642 --> 12:18.147
in England and any information they could glean that could be useful.

12:19.257 --> 12:24.104
I want you to, if you can, talk in as much detail as you can remember about the trip over.

12:24.184 --> 12:28.130
You said you left from Weymouth, England, which was on the south border of England.

12:28.651 --> 12:29.492
Southern coast, right.

12:29.512 --> 12:38.205
Southern coast of England on an LST, which was one of the tank transport landing ship, landing ship tank.

12:38.746 --> 12:46.598
That's the type of ship that has two huge doors that can be opened and a ramp drops so that heavy equipment

12:47.118 --> 13:15.420
tanks or that can drive off onto the land. What was, sort of recreate what it was like. In this where did you sleep? Where did you what did you do when you weren't asleep? You were surrounded... It was only a 12-hour trip right for us. Right. And we were we boarded about dusk. I see. So that meant we all tried to find a place where we could lie down. Exactly. Some of the fellows found out that the uh

13:16.447 --> 13:20.290
canvas top of a two and a half ton truck made a nice hammock.

13:20.951 --> 13:24.174
And so they climbed up there and went to sleep.

13:24.194 --> 13:27.917
What they didn't realize was that that truck was parked right at the rail.

13:28.658 --> 13:31.600
And if they'd have made the wrong move, they'd have been in the drink.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.362
That's right.

13:33.622 --> 13:36.464
And nobody probably would have missed them.

13:36.484 --> 13:37.465
That's right.

13:37.485 --> 13:43.791
So in this LST, there was equipment, there was trucks, and there were soldiers.

13:44.251 --> 13:45.492
That's right.

13:46.045 --> 13:46.887
It was packed.

13:46.907 --> 13:47.508
It was packed.

13:47.528 --> 13:48.691
It was pretty crowded.

13:48.731 --> 13:51.858
They utilized every square foot that they could.

13:52.179 --> 13:52.900
Right, right.

13:53.281 --> 14:02.903
When you, did you have a notion at the time of what you were going to find when you got to the beach?

14:02.983 --> 14:04.206
You knew that it had been

14:04.777 --> 14:09.362
what, anywhere from 10 days to two weeks since the invasion.

14:09.503 --> 14:10.444
Or less.

14:10.564 --> 14:11.064
Or less.

14:11.265 --> 14:11.745
Right.

14:11.765 --> 14:19.134
But at the time, when you were about to land at Utah Beach, did you all have any idea what you were going to find, whether there'd still be resistance going on or whatever?

14:19.154 --> 14:23.619
We had no idea of what we might run into or expect.

14:24.200 --> 14:31.108
As it turns out, the front was probably, by that time, maybe 20 miles in.

14:32.309 --> 14:32.449
Mm-hmm.

14:32.470 --> 14:32.910
And...

14:34.679 --> 14:40.288
the LST ran up on the beach but didn't get up quite far enough.

14:40.368 --> 14:44.935
So we waited for the tide to change, back off, ran up again.

14:44.995 --> 14:46.538
And this time we got off.

14:47.519 --> 14:58.797
And we climbed up out of the LST and across the beach and up a road that had been cut in by

14:59.063 --> 15:15.842
other engineers and we were in an assembly area and some of the fellows went out to explore much to their later regret because they came back and said they had found some German bodies.

15:16.703 --> 15:25.172
The CO had them say well take me there and show me and after he viewed them he told them now you bury them.

15:25.321 --> 15:33.696
So, but then we marched that night and got to what turned out to be an open field.

15:33.716 --> 15:43.093
It was raining and they said, well, pitch your pup tents and we'll stay here tonight and then we'll see where we go tomorrow.

15:43.413 --> 15:44.916
It was raining and it was dark.

15:45.402 --> 16:12.540
Pitch black. You were you were somewhere in France and and with after having marched right for quite a while. A couple hours. For a couple of hours. Right. That's right. Um and you built a tent city. Trucks that was just picked you up took you further inland where you built a tent. Right that was our first assignment was to build this tent city for some headquarters. I don't know what headquarters and

16:13.077 --> 16:18.530
After that transpired, we completed that task.

16:18.550 --> 16:22.941
We got picked up and we were assigned then to the military pipeline.

16:22.961 --> 16:23.763
Right.

16:23.783 --> 16:27.031
I want to talk about that because it's a fascinating part of what your duty was.

16:27.051 --> 16:30.158
These were fuel pipelines that actually...

16:30.712 --> 16:36.482
Will you tell us exactly what the pipelines were, sort of describe how it looked, how far apart they were?

16:36.803 --> 16:37.183
Okay.

16:37.644 --> 16:48.022
The pipeline consisted of three four-inch lines, two of which carried 80 octane gas, one carried 100 octane gas.

16:48.483 --> 16:52.850
The 80 for vehicles, the 100 for tanks and planes.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.373
Right.

16:54.910 --> 17:07.344
The pipeline itself consisted of lengths of steel pipe, each one about 20 feet long, and there was a rubber gasket and couplings.

17:07.364 --> 17:09.547
So it had some flexibility.

17:10.128 --> 17:20.800
If they ran into something that was too abrupt, they would have to use welding torches and cut it and make a special length of pipe.

17:21.978 --> 17:36.340
The pumping stations were located about every five miles, and each station had 12 engines with pumps.

17:36.881 --> 17:43.230
Three engines, four pipes, so about 12 engines.

17:43.450 --> 17:49.099
One group was a spare in reserve in case something happened to

17:49.298 --> 18:16.842
one of the active groups but then they would change off. First my task was to help service and maintain the engines and pumps. And so we would go into a station and we would do one a day being transported from our headquarters to a station and we would shut down one bank at a time putting the reserve one in

18:17.176 --> 18:21.162
until we had run through all of the engines and pumps for that day.

18:21.522 --> 18:23.144
Then we'd go back to headquarters.

18:23.305 --> 18:23.785
Right.

18:23.805 --> 18:26.289
And the next day we would go to another station.

18:26.469 --> 18:27.891
So it was your job to keep them going.

18:28.011 --> 18:37.084
Matter of fact, I found a photograph that's not an exact photograph from Mr. Fliedner's experience, but the pump, as a matter of fact, here it is right now.

18:38.666 --> 18:45.415
This is very similar to the engines that you worked on and the pipes, right?

18:45.435 --> 18:45.816
Right.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.640
They were GMC engines.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.103
I don't know who made the pumps.

18:51.403 --> 18:52.265
Right, right.

18:52.285 --> 18:56.612
So these are, this is quite similar to what you worked on.

18:56.632 --> 19:01.700
You can see the pipes heading up to where the centrifugal pump is located.

19:02.501 --> 19:06.368
The engines in the forward or left side of that view.

19:07.690 --> 19:07.990
Right.

19:08.571 --> 19:12.698
So that gives you kind of an idea of what your job was, was to maintain those and to keep those

19:13.066 --> 19:18.231
oiled and running and the spark plugs going and everything to where it could all work, right?

19:18.311 --> 19:18.871
That's right.

19:19.132 --> 19:26.278
But at first, you told me that every day you'd go to the one that was five miles out, then you'd come back.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.781
Then you'd go to the one 10 miles out, then 15 and 20.

19:29.181 --> 19:32.004
But they finally figured out that they could be more efficient than that, right?

19:32.204 --> 19:33.285
Right.

19:33.305 --> 19:37.028
They decided that, hey, we're spending a lot of time in traveling.

19:37.569 --> 19:39.951
So they assigned a mechanic

19:40.420 --> 19:43.968
to stay permanently at each pumping station.

19:43.988 --> 19:49.381
And that was his then sole responsibility to maintain those engines and pumps.

19:50.403 --> 19:53.029
And that worked out very well.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.946
And I was fortunate in the one that I got assigned to.

19:59.089 --> 20:08.305
It was near where the Germans had constructed some barrack-like buildings with prefabricated panels.

20:09.046 --> 20:14.595
And my predecessor there had built a little hut, which I occupied.

20:14.862 --> 20:18.093
which was probably very, very good accommodations.

20:19.297 --> 20:25.497
And I used, I like to read, so I used either candles or

20:25.730 --> 20:30.697
piece of rope and a bottle of gasoline for light until I got smart one day.

20:30.857 --> 20:32.099
Yeah, tell us about this.

20:32.119 --> 20:37.446
And I found a French car that had been hit at a railroad crossing.

20:37.466 --> 20:45.236
So I salvaged the battery and one of the headlights and rigged that up, and that became a reading lamp for me.

20:45.256 --> 20:53.948
And when the battery would start getting low, I'd take it out, put it on one of the engines, take that one, which was fully charged, and bring it back.

20:55.177 --> 21:03.325
Your resourcefulness goes on, as a matter of fact, a little later on, another story that I want you to tell, but the war was in front of you at this time.

21:03.365 --> 21:14.996
You were not in resistance right now, but what you were doing was making sure that this pipeline was pumping the gasoline necessary to the front to run the tanks, to fuel the aircraft.

21:15.516 --> 21:22.583
So, I mean, what you were doing was not just extremely essential to the war, it made it possible to fight the war.

21:22.983 --> 21:25.065
Yes, because after all, the Army

21:26.176 --> 21:50.749
really was mechanized and dependent upon vehicles. Right right. For every everything. Right right so if your pipeline broke down there would be problems. Now you had a commander who uh decided that he wouldn't be much of a commander unless he got his guys a little bit closer to the front and he was going to take some of them to the front and leave some of them back but. Yes our our regimental colonel

21:51.505 --> 21:57.630
I'm sure he was old army and I'm sure he figured this was his last hurrah.

21:58.311 --> 22:04.836
So he realized that if he wanted to earn a star, he had to be up close to the front.

22:04.856 --> 22:13.844
So he made a deal where he would leave just a handful of men to train new engineers coming from the States.

22:14.925 --> 22:18.328
And he would take then the bulk of his men up.

22:18.348 --> 22:21.090
They wound up, I believe in Belgium.

22:21.408 --> 22:27.976
and I was one of the ones selected to stay behind and train newcomers.

22:27.996 --> 22:39.210
I guess the reason for that being that I had run a small two-tank farm outside of Saint-Lo and of course I had been on the engines and pumps and knew how they worked.

22:39.991 --> 22:49.002
So I was on detached duty with these new fellows and eventually

22:49.471 --> 22:53.339
I became cadre for a new outfit that was formed in the theater.

22:54.101 --> 22:59.252
And my assignment then was to become a pumping station foreman.

22:59.272 --> 23:03.641
And I might see an officer once a week for a few minutes.

23:04.423 --> 23:08.812
My other contact was by telephone to our company headquarters.

23:08.832 --> 23:09.133
Right.

23:09.637 --> 23:12.500
You describe yourself as you were not a yes man.

23:12.540 --> 23:16.245
You told people what you think, even if it got you in trouble sometimes.

23:16.405 --> 23:23.514
And it did get me in trouble, both during service and later on in life, in civilian life.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.616
But you got promoted.

23:25.636 --> 23:27.058
You got promoted to staff sergeant.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.120
You got a rocker underneath you.

23:29.381 --> 23:32.364
I never was a PFC.

23:32.444 --> 23:37.230
I went from private to buck corporal and from buck corporal to staff.

23:37.210 --> 24:02.273
Talk about your resourcefulness. You told me a story about how you created a hot shower for people. Right there was a spring located above us on a hill and we dammed up the spring and ran some pipe down we built a shack and we rigged a stove so that we could heat water so we had hot showers for our guys.

24:02.573 --> 24:20.476
I've got to move on, but there's another story that we can't really get into about how you were able to acquire a generator from a German tank and literally create an electric plant and almost light up a city yourself, or light up a tent city.

24:20.496 --> 24:27.245
We lighted up our five tents, that's for sure, and that was a big boon.

24:27.665 --> 24:28.767
Right.

24:28.827 --> 24:30.589
The war ended in Europe.

24:30.788 --> 24:34.994
Excuse me, the war ended in Europe and the pipeline shut down.

24:35.014 --> 24:38.239
And now it's June of 1945 and you're off to the Pacific.

24:38.259 --> 24:42.125
We've got about five minutes left, but let's talk about that trip.

24:42.145 --> 24:43.667
You left from Marseille.

24:43.787 --> 24:49.936
We were taken from near Saint-Laurent up to Paris and put on 40 and 8s.

24:49.956 --> 24:53.381
And believe me, that was probably the most comfortable trip I ever had.

24:53.561 --> 24:54.963
Right, those were Mott's car.

24:55.504 --> 24:59.530
Right, this famous 40 and 8s from World War I.

24:59.948 --> 25:03.412
We went down to Marseille.

25:03.992 --> 25:08.777
We were in a camp there a couple of days when we were loaded on ship.

25:08.797 --> 25:27.357
And, of course, we didn't know our destination, but it turned out to be that we sailed the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, across the South Atlantic, through the Panama Canal, and all the way across the Pacific, following almost the equator in...

25:27.877 --> 25:30.141
Well, part of that trip was in July.

25:31.123 --> 25:32.605
The heat was unbearable.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.570
You couldn't almost walk on the steel decks of the boat.

25:35.771 --> 25:36.051
Wow.

25:36.893 --> 25:42.703
And we wound up eventually in Manila, and there we went out on Bataan.

25:42.923 --> 25:44.426
This was a 30-day trip.

25:44.446 --> 25:45.388
30-day trip.

25:45.528 --> 25:47.792
30-day trip in another packed boat.

25:48.593 --> 25:51.739
That was an APA.

25:51.919 --> 25:52.500
Yeah.

25:53.240 --> 26:00.488
Supposedly, the fellow, the sailors on board said they had doubled the air conditioning.

26:01.109 --> 26:06.354
Well, if they did, we didn't realize it because it was hot.

26:06.374 --> 26:06.695
It was.

26:07.455 --> 26:15.624
So you landed in Manila in July, and your assignment then was to build a tank farm to store gasoline in tanks.

26:15.644 --> 26:15.865
Right.

26:15.985 --> 26:18.167
Our assignment was to go out...

26:18.350 --> 26:24.235
And it turned out we were down on the Batan Peninsula building this tank farm.

26:25.677 --> 26:34.865
And then, of course, we received the news about the atom bomb and Japan surrendering.

26:35.446 --> 26:44.274
And all of us breathed a sigh of relief because we were not looking forward to invading the homeland.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.235
Right.

26:45.788 --> 26:47.571
Everybody knew what you were there for.

26:47.591 --> 26:49.914
You were there to prepare for an invasion of Japan.

26:50.134 --> 26:50.755
That's right.

26:50.995 --> 26:54.701
Which would have been a whole different kind of conflict.

26:54.721 --> 26:55.021
Correct.

26:55.041 --> 26:56.864
I think as everybody knows.

26:56.884 --> 26:58.666
It would have been a real bloodbath.

26:58.846 --> 27:04.995
Indeed, which everybody would have been involved in.

27:05.566 --> 27:13.876
the bombs were dropped, the peace was signed, and you were offered to stay, to re-up for four years as part of an occupational army.

27:13.896 --> 27:14.437
Correct.

27:14.457 --> 27:16.499
And you said, okay, if I can go home.

27:16.519 --> 27:26.452
Yes, because in all of my experience, which was now over two years overseas, I'd had one three-day pass.

27:26.492 --> 27:27.713
I'd never had a furlough.

27:28.474 --> 27:34.982
And I thought that that was something I wanted before I went to a,

27:35.232 --> 27:38.297
another foreign land and stayed there for years.

27:39.298 --> 27:50.276
They said they couldn't manage that and because of my service in Europe I had the points under the point system and I just thought well then just send me home period.

27:50.496 --> 27:53.140
And you went home in 1945 as a matter of fact you

27:53.744 --> 27:59.711
They sent you to Seattle, then you took the train all the way to New Jersey, and I think you ended up being in New Jersey about on Christmas Day.

27:59.751 --> 28:02.114
So it was a nice Christmas surprise for your family.

28:02.134 --> 28:06.178
We arrived in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Christmas Day morning.

28:06.339 --> 28:06.719
On 1945.

28:06.759 --> 28:11.945
There's so much more to your story, and we are out of time now, but thank you for your service.

28:12.345 --> 28:15.029
And it's a great, unique story of serving on both fronts.

28:15.850 --> 28:20.615
Well, it was, I guess, one of the great experiences of my life.

28:20.795 --> 28:22.317
Thank you, sir, for your service, Robert.

28:23.039 --> 28:28.627
Most European theater veterans of World War II were supposed to go to the Pacific Theater after VA Day.

28:28.647 --> 28:34.255
But as you just heard, most never got there because of the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki ending the war.

28:34.636 --> 28:39.462
Robert Fliedner, though, was one of those rare soldiers who saw the two different conflicts firsthand.

28:39.482 --> 28:42.847
His is a remarkable story of service on both sides of the globe.

28:43.548 --> 28:44.710
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:44.730 --> 28:46.853
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:46.853 --> 28:52.000
[Silence.]

28:52.000 --> 29:02.000
[Music.]

29:02.000 --> 29:14.000
[Music.]
