In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.902 --> 00:41.158
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:44.817 --> 01:12.797
Hello and welcome to Veteran to the Valley.

01:12.817 --> 01:13.879
I'm Tom Turveyville.

01:14.838 --> 01:21.325
Last week, we introduced you to Dr. Douglas Starr, who many an Aggie journalism student knows as Professor Starr.

01:21.885 --> 01:29.213
But you know him now as World War II veteran Doug Starr, Navy Soderman aboard the tin can USS Nicholas.

01:29.233 --> 01:44.288
Today, we'll talk about and we'll see some incredible photos from what Doug Starr witnessed up pretty close, the official end of World War II, the signing of the Japanese instrument of surrender aboard the USS Missouri to September 1945.

01:44.268 --> 01:54.419
and there was Korea aboard the USS Walk and his post-war life as a journalist for Associated Press and the path that brought him to Texas A&M in 1986.

01:54.539 --> 01:58.022
Please welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, Professor Douglas Starr.

01:58.543 --> 02:01.806
Great to have you back and great to continue what's really a fascinating story.

02:02.227 --> 02:11.136
For those who weren't with us last week, we can't repeat all of that, but you were aboard the USS Nicholas and we talked about what that

02:11.116 --> 02:15.220
ship that destroyer did in the war, 13 battle stars that you were involved in.

02:15.841 --> 02:27.073
And then talk about to September 1945, obviously a very historic date, the date of the signing of the surrender of Japan and how the USS Nicholas was involved that day and the days leading up to it.

02:27.093 --> 02:27.513
Go ahead.

02:28.134 --> 02:40.667
OK, we were lead ship in Halsey's Admiral Halsey's third fleet off the coast of Japan, 55 days waiting to go in to take in the landing party.

02:41.288 --> 02:46.893
to attack the home island of Japan in case the Japanese decided not to surrender.

02:47.854 --> 02:55.740
And toward the end of this 55-day thing, there were negotiations going on between President Truman and the emperor.

02:56.461 --> 03:01.705
And he told them he had a bomb, and the emperor didn't believe it, so we dropped the bomb.

03:02.386 --> 03:04.548
And the emperor said, well, you don't have another one.

03:04.948 --> 03:06.470
And Truman said, yes, I do.

03:06.950 --> 03:10.553
And he didn't believe that, so we dropped another one, and then the war was over.

03:11.005 --> 03:17.773
Well, the projected casualty rate would have been a million soldiers and sailors.

03:18.834 --> 03:22.318
And so it stopped all of that carnage.

03:22.338 --> 03:27.063
So instead of going in as an attacking force, we went in as an occupying force.

03:28.224 --> 03:36.253
But to go in, we needed pilots and interpreters and all that because Tsugami Bay, which is the entrance to Tokyo Bay,

03:36.588 --> 03:39.071
was mined, and we didn't know where the mines were.

03:39.332 --> 03:40.794
And so we had to have people to tell us.

03:41.254 --> 03:46.301
So they sent out a gunboat with all of these interpreters and pilots.

03:47.182 --> 03:47.943
We picked them up.

03:48.204 --> 03:50.947
We transferred them to the Missouri and to other ships.

03:51.869 --> 03:55.153
And then we led the formation into Sagami.

03:55.555 --> 03:58.800
That evening, we anchored in the bay.

03:59.521 --> 04:06.751
There was Mount Fuji off in the distance, beautiful mountain, looked like a little pile of sugar there with a snow-capped top.

04:07.872 --> 04:17.786
And when the sun started to go down, the captain ordered darkened ship, which was routine in a dangerous place.

04:18.727 --> 04:22.693
And when Admiral Halsey saw all the ships go dark,

04:23.028 --> 04:30.259
He got on the radio and he stole all ships, light ship, because he wanted to impress the Japanese that we weren't afraid of them.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.885
We were, because we didn't know what they were going to do.

04:33.965 --> 04:39.133
But fortunately, they obeyed the emperor and did not do anything against us.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.535
So we slept through the night.

04:40.876 --> 04:41.877
Right, right.

04:42.278 --> 04:46.825
And then into Tokyo Bay and the...

04:46.805 --> 05:07.809
You touched on it, but I want to talk more about the signing of the surrender and the people that you picked up, the dignitaries that you picked up, some 65, I believe, or so dignitaries from China, all the allied nations, plus American admirals and generals.

05:08.790 --> 05:12.934
When you think back of it, this was quite an awesome responsibility.

05:13.014 --> 05:16.238
Did you realize at the time the history that you were witnessing?

05:16.454 --> 05:16.995
Kind of.

05:17.716 --> 05:22.383
I was only 19 years old, so what do you know when you're 19 years old?

05:22.403 --> 05:26.348
But yeah, I kind of thought, this is really something I'll tell my father when I get home.

05:27.230 --> 05:29.853
Of course, he knew it, but I was going to tell him anyway.

05:31.536 --> 05:37.264
But we spent that night in Sagami, and the next day we went into Tokyo Bay.

05:37.919 --> 05:39.541
And the Missouri anchored out.

05:39.721 --> 05:45.209
And then four destroyers were assigned the duty to pick up dignitaries.

05:45.229 --> 05:52.539
So we had 65 or so of the Allied high-ranking officers who were going to witness the signing.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.121
They didn't all sign it.

05:54.161 --> 05:57.185
They were standing there watching the ceremony.

05:58.087 --> 06:01.652
And each of the other three ships had about that same number of people.

06:01.672 --> 06:07.099
And we acted like a taxi service from the wharf to the Missouri, dropped them off, and then

06:07.838 --> 06:13.268
anchored close by because we had to take them off and take them back after the ceremony was over.

06:13.288 --> 06:13.548
Right.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.831
So we were close enough.

06:14.891 --> 06:19.098
We could see what was going on on the deck of the Missouri there.

06:19.299 --> 06:19.519
Right.

06:19.599 --> 06:22.905
You were up on the bridge where you sort of strained your neck to sort of see what was going on.

06:22.985 --> 06:23.526
Didn't have to.

06:23.586 --> 06:24.628
Just stand there and look.

06:24.728 --> 06:25.750
Just stand there and just watch them.

06:25.770 --> 06:25.991
Yeah.

06:26.191 --> 06:26.792
Yeah.

06:26.772 --> 06:42.652
Some of the people that were actually on the USS Nicholas that you transported to the ceremony that people will certainly know from their military history, General Stilwell, General Wainwright, Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle was on your ship.

06:42.952 --> 06:43.954
Little bitty fella.

06:43.974 --> 06:45.375
Yeah, yes.

06:45.395 --> 06:46.797
Major General Curtis LeMay.

06:47.839 --> 06:52.965
And then other allied representatives, six from China, five from Russia.

06:52.945 --> 07:06.277
seven from Australia, a Canadian, four French, including General Leclerc, was on your ship, five from the Netherlands, and one from New Zealand, and the way you transported them from one ship to the other.

07:07.077 --> 07:07.918
Talk about that.

07:07.938 --> 07:22.851
Well, we used what's called the breeches buoy, and what you do is you put a rope between the two ships, and a chair is hung on that rope, and you pull it, and it pulls them across from one ship to the other.

07:22.831 --> 07:28.523
Well, we were very careful because we were transporting dignitaries, and we couldn't drop them and dunk them into the bay.

07:28.543 --> 07:29.846
You don't want to give them a dip.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.489
They wouldn't think that was as funny as you would.

07:31.610 --> 07:32.451
Yeah, that's right.

07:33.013 --> 07:40.789
So we were very careful, and we transported all 65, and we had two of those breeches boys going, so we were doing two at a time.

07:40.921 --> 07:45.107
And it took some time to do that, but we got them all over there dry.

07:45.948 --> 07:48.091
And they got aboard ship, and then they all lined up.

07:48.111 --> 07:56.724
You've seen the pictures of the actual ceremony, and boy, just a solid wall of people standing there.

07:56.904 --> 07:57.525
Of the dignitaries.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.987
Of the dignitaries from all over.

07:59.208 --> 08:00.069
Right.

08:00.089 --> 08:09.122
When you were standing on the bridge there of the Nicholas and looking over and seeing Admiral Chester Nimitz standing there on the bridge of the Missouri.

08:09.997 --> 08:10.939
We talked about this.

08:10.999 --> 08:12.621
I want you to tell me about it.

08:12.782 --> 08:18.311
For a young soldier only 19 years old at the time, you must have been a little bit starstruck at that, right?

08:18.451 --> 08:21.977
Well, yeah, because you don't get seeing Admiral very often.

08:22.298 --> 08:23.620
That was the first one I ever saw.

08:24.582 --> 08:27.527
He was standing there watching all the things we were doing.

08:27.848 --> 08:35.160
He wasn't looking at me, but he was looking at the activity of actually transporting these people back and forth to the ship.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.666
But it was quite a sight to see him standing there.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.471
And he was just leaning on the rail.

08:41.491 --> 08:41.751
Right.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.035
As a young sailor, you're thinking, hey, there's the boss.

08:44.055 --> 08:44.957
There's the main man.

08:44.977 --> 08:45.197
Yeah.

08:45.478 --> 08:47.080
That's more impressive than the president.

08:47.100 --> 08:47.421
Oh, yeah.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.064
Certainly more impressive than seeing MacArthur.

08:49.104 --> 08:50.165
He's the army guy, right?

08:50.186 --> 08:51.267
Yeah, he was the soldier.

08:51.548 --> 08:52.650
We weren't too interested.

08:53.311 --> 08:54.032
He was the soldier.

08:54.413 --> 09:00.523
I want you to tell a story that I've never heard it before about something that happened during that signing.

09:00.976 --> 09:02.019
And about the table.

09:02.039 --> 09:02.621
The table?

09:02.641 --> 09:02.982
Yeah, go ahead.

09:03.002 --> 09:03.824
I'm going to let you tell them.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.629
Well, yeah, okay.

09:06.251 --> 09:14.715
As I was told by somebody who was there in Missouri, they said they got everybody around and they said, well,

09:15.117 --> 09:17.662
Where are we going to put these papers to sign?

09:17.722 --> 09:19.525
They said, well, we need a table.

09:20.246 --> 09:21.929
Oh, where are we going to get one?

09:21.949 --> 09:28.080
Well, the mess hall is full of tables, so they sent a couple of sailors down to the mess hall, and they came back up with the table, and they set it down.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.827
They put a nice green cloth on top to make it look nice.

09:32.262 --> 09:33.706
for the cameras.

09:33.726 --> 09:37.736
And so then they signed it all, and everything was done.

09:38.097 --> 09:40.283
Salutes, thank you, clap, clap, and everybody leaves.

09:40.764 --> 09:42.368
Two sailors put the table back.

09:42.910 --> 09:43.391
In the mess hall.

09:43.491 --> 09:44.133
In the mess hall.

09:44.554 --> 09:47.301
And so somebody says, where's the table?

09:47.281 --> 09:49.444
Well, we put it back.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.065
Well, get it.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.668
It's a famous table.

09:51.688 --> 09:53.090
They didn't know which one they picked up.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.415
They went in the mess, saw all these tables, didn't know which one it was.

09:56.455 --> 09:57.336
They're all the same.

09:57.357 --> 09:57.737
Exactly.

09:58.558 --> 10:01.122
So this famous table that could be in the Smithsonian now.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.825
Yeah, it's still in the Missouri.

10:02.845 --> 10:05.108
It's still in the Missouri because nobody knows which one it was.

10:05.128 --> 10:06.150
And nobody knows.

10:06.704 --> 10:10.631
And like you told me, if that guy had been smart, he'd have just said, hey, yes, this one right here.

10:10.831 --> 10:18.103
And he would have, if the man was still alive or if he had gone to his death, knowing that, hey, he didn't know whether that was the right table or not.

10:18.183 --> 10:21.088
But, you know, every table looked exactly alike.

10:21.108 --> 10:23.953
We had the same tables in the Destroyer.

10:23.933 --> 10:24.934
The missing table.

10:24.954 --> 10:25.775
The missing table.

10:25.795 --> 10:27.878
We've got a lot of photographs that I want to see.

10:27.958 --> 10:36.489
And before we go to the photographs, I want to tell people that a lot of the photographs that you're about to see come from the website of the USS Nicholas.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.912
And it's an incredible website.

10:38.932 --> 10:49.646
And I urge anybody with any interest in World War II history or certainly Pacific history, it's very easy, www.ussnicholas.org.

10:49.806 --> 10:52.810
Go to that website, and you'll see not only a first-person account,

10:52.790 --> 11:02.930
his experience from Doug Starr but about half a dozen others who are on that website and lots and lots of photographs in history of this magnificent destroyer.

11:02.950 --> 11:06.698
Let's go ahead and go to some of the photographs that we have here that we're going to talk about.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.973
First off, by way of review, there is a young sailor, Douglas Starr.

11:10.993 --> 11:12.836
And this was after World War II, right?

11:12.856 --> 11:14.318
Yeah, I'm 20 years old here.

11:14.519 --> 11:15.320
Oh, you're an old man.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.782
Yeah, just turned 20.

11:17.143 --> 11:21.049
And that's a sonar rating badge on the left sleeve there.

11:21.970 --> 11:24.013
Earphones with an hour going through it.

11:24.254 --> 11:27.399
We talked a little bit last week about the skill of being a sonar man.

11:28.080 --> 11:28.180
Yeah.

11:28.548 --> 11:36.582
And, of course, the first of the ribbons, and you were to accumulate several more ribbons and medals in your service.

11:36.603 --> 11:36.863
Yeah.

11:37.043 --> 11:37.444
There you go.

11:37.845 --> 11:38.165
Okay.

11:38.706 --> 11:39.728
This is a good picture of you.

11:39.969 --> 11:43.515
This is a young Doug Starr and one of your shipmates, right?

11:43.535 --> 11:45.038
On the left, yeah.

11:45.058 --> 11:45.919
You're on the left, right?

11:45.939 --> 11:52.952
We had just finished sonar school because that's my rating badge, and his is on his sleeve, but you can't see it.

11:53.236 --> 12:04.756
I want to keep that up just a second, because you said to me before we started this show, and this photograph really brings what you said into focus, that World War II was fought by kids.

12:05.657 --> 12:06.499
Yeah, legal children.

12:06.699 --> 12:07.881
Look at those two faces.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.185
I mean, those are kids.

12:10.746 --> 12:17.337
Those are high school-looking kids, if that, and you're the one on the left, and these are the kids that

12:17.587 --> 12:23.780
who I believe you said in a recent speech that you were born in New Orleans, but you grew up on the Nicholas, right?

12:24.181 --> 12:25.103
In the South Pacific.

12:25.163 --> 12:25.664
That's right.

12:26.225 --> 12:27.568
And that's where you grew up.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.859
There's the Nicholas, another good photograph.

12:34.483 --> 12:34.583
Yeah.

12:34.985 --> 12:35.325
of it.

12:35.345 --> 12:36.346
And that's a destroyer.

12:36.366 --> 12:39.750
Destroyers are small ships by comparison.

12:40.491 --> 12:44.856
They're about a football field long, a little bit more, 376 feet long.

12:44.876 --> 12:46.297
And how did you describe its size?

12:46.357 --> 12:48.380
It's black long and across the street wide.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.844
And it's the most beautiful, if you look at it, it's the most beautiful ship ever designed.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.267
There's a lot packed into a small ship.

12:55.287 --> 12:58.090
Oh boy, there's nothing in it but ammunition.

12:58.475 --> 13:05.424
Well, I mean, you think of an aircraft carrier and how you can walk on an aircraft carrier, and it's like you're on land or in a building.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.346
Oh, well, this thing was in constant motion.

13:07.587 --> 13:12.193
We had 300 enlisted and 30 officers crowded into that thing.

13:12.493 --> 13:18.961
We had 200 men living aft, 100 men living forward, 30 officers living in the forward part of the ship.

13:19.282 --> 13:21.264
And it's called a tin can because it was so small.

13:21.325 --> 13:27.132
As a matter of fact, I believe I read something that you wrote that said you go down below at your bunk,

13:27.314 --> 13:30.239
And you could actually put your hand against the wall to feel the water rushing by.

13:30.259 --> 13:30.920
Feel the water go by.

13:31.240 --> 13:31.681
That's right.

13:32.302 --> 13:34.085
It was only about that thick.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.547
A quarter inch thick.

13:35.567 --> 13:38.592
Now here's a series of photographs of what we've just been talking about.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.794
2 September 1945.

13:39.954 --> 13:50.651
In the foreground of the photograph, or the for water, I guess it was, on the right side, that's the USS Missouri, and that's the Nicholas alongside on the left.

13:50.671 --> 13:53.756
And I guess back behind, is that the other destroyers coming up?

13:53.776 --> 13:54.537
Other destroyers, yeah.

13:55.023 --> 13:56.725
But this is the Nicholas alongside.

13:57.685 --> 14:07.634
And you can see the comparison of the two ships and its size because your ship, Nicholas on the left, is a football field or more long.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.617
So you think how long that is, you see how long the Missouri is.

14:11.097 --> 14:19.705
And we were about to transfer the dignitaries across, the interpreters and pilots, Japanese.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.827
We've got more photographs.

14:21.867 --> 14:22.988
Let's go on to the next one.

14:23.525 --> 14:28.132
There's the same time, Missouri, and you're on the other side.

14:30.475 --> 14:35.903
About to, again, about for the signing of the peace agreement.

14:40.069 --> 14:42.853
That's another good comparison of the size.

14:42.873 --> 14:45.057
See, they had three cannons in the mount.

14:45.678 --> 14:46.819
Missouri, we had one.

14:48.422 --> 14:48.722
Right.

14:50.373 --> 14:52.515
Now, this is the transport.

14:52.535 --> 14:56.739
That's the breacher's boy with somebody in it, and it's being moved across.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.662
I believe that's one of the Chinese delegates.

14:59.962 --> 15:00.483
Yeah.

15:00.563 --> 15:04.006
It's being moved across from, that picture is taken from the Missouri.

15:04.026 --> 15:04.727
From the Missouri.

15:04.747 --> 15:06.789
Back to the USS Nicholas 449.

15:06.809 --> 15:08.130
Yeah, C449.

15:08.331 --> 15:09.071
Coming across.

15:10.373 --> 15:15.077
And yeah, I would think that, yeah, when they're right about at that point, you're thinking, let's not dip him now.

15:15.237 --> 15:15.998
Let's get him across.

15:16.058 --> 15:16.819
Yeah, that's right.

15:17.103 --> 15:19.790
But look at the waves that we're in.

15:19.810 --> 15:20.111
Yes.

15:20.191 --> 15:22.056
You know, that's not a placid sea.

15:22.778 --> 15:22.998
No.

15:23.018 --> 15:24.322
No, that's, yeah.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.888
Yeah, a situation there.

15:27.069 --> 15:28.552
Talk about this photograph.

15:28.974 --> 15:33.846
This is in the mess hall where the officers eat, called the wardroom.

15:33.826 --> 15:40.657
And if you'll see that the people with the hats on, those are our officers.

15:40.718 --> 16:00.070
The people seated and the fellow on the far left, these are three Japanese, I don't know whether they're pilots or interpreters, but they are three of the Japanese contingent that we had aboard to take us into Tsugami Bay because it was mined and we needed to know where not to go.

16:00.674 --> 16:07.550
If you notice that the officer standing in the rear, he has a .45 pistol on his belt.

16:07.570 --> 16:10.256
Right, because there's still an issue of trust going on.

16:10.276 --> 16:10.737
Oh, yeah.

16:11.118 --> 16:11.599
Oh, yeah.

16:12.922 --> 16:13.443
Absolutely.

16:13.503 --> 16:15.428
He would have shot them in a friendly sort of way.

16:15.448 --> 16:17.913
Right, in a friendly sort of way.

16:17.933 --> 16:18.615
Yeah, okay.

16:19.405 --> 16:46.915
move on to now you're not in this photograph but it's part of your cruise book talk about what that's our scoreboard and that that piece of equipment there is a fire control and that we it's a radar that we send out a signal and find out where the enemy is and then the cannons can track that from this this equipment the officer is a fire control officer and the sailors up on the top they're all fire control operators

16:47.452 --> 16:55.805
And the officer's pointing out our scoreboard, the airplanes that we shot down, the ships, I mean, submarines that we sank.

16:55.825 --> 17:09.105
And that flag in there is the symbol of the presidential unit citation that Nicholas got before I went aboard for rescuing survivors of the cruiser Helena that was sunk in the Battle of Kula Gulf.

17:10.823 --> 17:12.025
fascinating photographs.

17:12.045 --> 17:18.493
And again, if viewers want to see these photographs, I'll tell you again, it's ussnicholas.org.

17:18.513 --> 17:19.354
There's more than that.

17:19.474 --> 17:20.675
And there's a lot more than that.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.518
Believe me, there's a lot more than that.

17:22.578 --> 17:30.308
You can click to every link on there and you can see lots and lots of pictures aboard both vessels, as a matter of fact.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.051
What was the

17:33.267 --> 17:45.133
the atmosphere, I guess, like, because I'm thinking about aboard the Nicholas, here you are, you all had spent several months fighting this war at the height of the conflict in the Pacific campaign.

17:45.670 --> 18:01.435
fighting the war, as we talked about last week, you yourself were involved in enough campaigns and battles to earn 13 battle stars, kamikaze rage that fortunately your ship was able to miss.

18:02.016 --> 18:03.358
And all of a sudden,

18:03.625 --> 18:19.826
The whole atmosphere of what's going on is thrown into politics, into peace movement, into these people that have come aboard your boat, these dignitaries from the different countries, the allied countries, and the USS Missouri.

18:20.647 --> 18:27.777
The whole idea of the war and everything that you all were doing on a daily basis sort of changed quickly, didn't it?

18:27.797 --> 18:27.957
It did.

18:28.017 --> 18:30.240
It changed immediately.

18:30.642 --> 18:58.995
Now, we had all these, all of these people who came aboard were very high-ranking officers, and I was, you know, they were a step or two down from God, and I was two jumps up from the apes, and we couldn't associate with them in any way, but we had a signalman who was red-haired, and he had a full red beard, and two Russian admirals came up on the bridge when he was on watch, and I was up there on watch,

18:59.650 --> 19:03.297
And they spotted that red beard, and they went over, and they felt his beard.

19:03.798 --> 19:04.981
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

19:05.321 --> 19:06.364
And they felt his beard.

19:07.245 --> 19:11.033
And they thought that was the grandest thing they'd ever seen, because I don't know what they were talking about.

19:11.053 --> 19:14.520
They were talking in Russian.

19:15.243 --> 19:19.771
For red and the word for beautiful, that's the same word.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.494
That's why they call it red square.

19:21.514 --> 19:22.817
It means beautiful square.

19:23.338 --> 19:26.103
And so they kept saying this was the red beard.

19:26.163 --> 19:28.687
Well, yeah, we thought it was red, but they were saying it was beautiful.

19:28.928 --> 19:29.769
I see.

19:30.891 --> 19:31.753
Poor guy stood there.

19:31.773 --> 19:32.935
He didn't know what to do.

19:32.955 --> 19:33.776
Right, right.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.403
So the language hurdles were involved, too.

19:37.383 --> 19:40.527
Okay, let's get past September the 2nd, after the surrender.

19:40.667 --> 19:57.747
Certainly, your duties were not over, and I want to go directly to what you were talking about, where you and three other destroyers, I believe, removed some 1,000 POWs from a POW camp in Japan, and talk about that.

19:57.767 --> 20:04.875
Yeah, this was in October, excuse me, yeah, late September, early October, we were sent up 500 miles

20:04.855 --> 20:12.331
north of Tokyo to a little town called Sendai on the coast, where there was a POW camp.

20:12.351 --> 20:17.802
The people in there were from the fall of the Philippines, so they've been there for four years.

20:18.372 --> 20:26.521
And we went up four destroyers and a contingent of Marines to break them out and take them back down to Tokyo to put them in hospitals and take care of them.

20:27.282 --> 20:27.942
So we did.

20:28.243 --> 20:30.986
And the Marines go ashore fully armed.

20:31.006 --> 20:33.668
And the sailors went on liberty.

20:33.688 --> 20:36.812
And so we didn't have any weapons or anything.

20:36.832 --> 20:38.033
We just walked around town.

20:38.093 --> 20:40.215
But they told us, don't go by yourself.

20:40.356 --> 20:41.937
Go in a group, which we did.

20:41.957 --> 20:43.519
But nobody bothered us.

20:44.107 --> 20:49.628
And they brought about 1,000 of those guys, and we had 250 of them per ship.

20:50.333 --> 20:54.377
And the captain told us no sailor sleeps in his bunk tonight.

20:54.977 --> 20:58.761
It's a 500-mile trip, you know, so the bunks are for the POWs.

20:59.441 --> 21:00.923
The POWs didn't want to sleep.

21:00.983 --> 21:01.903
They wanted to talk.

21:02.084 --> 21:02.644
Right.

21:02.664 --> 21:06.067
But they wanted to find out what was going on because they knew nothing at all.

21:06.367 --> 21:09.330
Because they hadn't seen a friendly face, some of them, since 1942.

21:09.390 --> 21:10.671
That's right.

21:10.751 --> 21:11.272
Exactly.

21:11.292 --> 21:11.752
Or 41.

21:11.772 --> 21:11.973
41.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.054
Yeah, maybe even.

21:13.754 --> 21:19.159
And so anyway, we stayed up all night talking, and the next morning,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.544
For breakfast, they would go around and find out what they wanted.

21:23.584 --> 21:27.228
They wanted pancakes, and so they cooked up a bunch of pancakes.

21:28.069 --> 21:35.298
We had to help them go down the ladders to the mess hall and carry the tray because they were too weak.

21:35.578 --> 21:42.987
You could count the ribs just standing there, the little pot bellies from malnutrition.

21:43.675 --> 21:52.125
They would take six or eight or 10 pancakes and put syrup all over it and butter and all that, take one bite, and they were through because the stomach couldn't handle it.

21:53.286 --> 21:58.612
And we'd lead them back up on deck and talk, talk, talk, talk, whatever you can talk about.

21:58.632 --> 22:00.594
They just wanted to talk.

22:00.614 --> 22:01.495
And we took them back down.

22:01.556 --> 22:04.459
We got them into Tokyo, and some went to the hospitals right away.

22:04.559 --> 22:08.063
Some were put on ships and sent right back to the States.

22:08.515 --> 22:10.537
depending on the condition they were in.

22:10.577 --> 22:21.430
And then I met one, oh, several months after the war in Los Angeles, and I asked him how he was doing.

22:21.450 --> 22:25.154
He said, well, he said, I don't eat three meals a day anymore.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.476
I said, what happened?

22:26.516 --> 22:27.858
He said, oh, I eat five or six.

22:28.178 --> 22:33.324
He said, I can't eat enough to last me for four hours.

22:33.404 --> 22:37.729
He says, I'd eat a little bit, and then two hours later, I'd eat a little bit more because my stomach won't hold it.

22:38.435 --> 22:41.244
But I'm told that eventually they got over that.

22:41.264 --> 22:41.806
Right.

22:41.826 --> 22:42.769
Back to normal.

22:43.170 --> 22:45.357
I know this is a very vivid memory for you, for sure.

22:46.681 --> 22:47.464
Need to move on.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.069
November, the

22:49.285 --> 22:54.476
30th, you went home for 30 days, went back, you were discharged in January of 1947, I believe.

22:54.516 --> 22:54.917
Right.

22:55.618 --> 22:56.961
And you went back to school.

22:56.981 --> 23:00.007
You went to Tulane and then eventually to LSU.

23:00.127 --> 23:00.408
Yeah.

23:00.909 --> 23:07.342
And because you wanted to be a journalist, you were a journalist and that's where you learned the journalism trade initially.

23:07.442 --> 23:07.923
Yes.

23:08.004 --> 23:09.827
In school at LSU, right?

23:10.028 --> 23:10.308
Right.

23:10.449 --> 23:10.669
Right.

23:11.037 --> 23:12.580
And then I got a job.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.584
Well, then I went back to Korea.

23:14.604 --> 23:18.191
I got married, and eight months later, I got recalled for Korea, and we went over there.

23:19.914 --> 23:22.399
On the USS Walk, another destroyer.

23:22.419 --> 23:24.623
Yeah, but it was a bigger destroyer.

23:24.643 --> 23:26.507
The necklace was 2,100 tons.

23:26.547 --> 23:27.910
The Walk was 2,200 tons.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.212
You can't tell the difference.

23:29.332 --> 23:29.894
No, no.

23:29.914 --> 23:31.477
100 tons, give or take, right?

23:31.497 --> 23:32.218
Give or take.

23:32.198 --> 23:35.685
So it's the same size and everything.

23:35.786 --> 23:46.208
And I was over there, and we opened the siege of Wansand, which turned out to be the longest naval siege in history, because it went on through the whole war.

23:46.677 --> 23:52.305
And we were there from the beginning, and we got shot at, well, same as in World War II.

23:52.686 --> 23:55.590
We shot them, they shot us, but we never got hit.

23:55.950 --> 23:56.732
Right, right.

23:57.092 --> 24:06.426
As a matter of fact, you were fortunate, I believe a month after you left the USS Walk, it was mined and hit a mine, and some 26 were killed and 40 injured.

24:06.606 --> 24:14.197
It was my compartment, and the people who slept around me, they didn't even find the bodies, they just went out into the sea.

24:14.497 --> 24:14.878
Right.

24:14.858 --> 24:20.249
We've just got about four minutes left to sort of wrap it up from there up until now.

24:20.329 --> 24:25.339
But I know that you just very quickly, you did work for the Associated Press.

24:25.580 --> 24:25.960
I did.

24:26.020 --> 24:26.802
For several years.

24:26.822 --> 24:30.309
And you were at Florida State in North Texas and eventually came to A&M in 1986.

24:30.349 --> 24:30.550
Right.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.255
Talk a little bit about your journalism career.

24:33.708 --> 24:38.634
Well, the most interesting part was when I was in Mississippi, in Jackson, Mississippi.

24:38.694 --> 24:43.220
I was there for eight years, and that was when the desegregation order came down from the Supreme Court.

24:43.781 --> 24:50.369
And we were covering all the activities that the state was trying to do to prevent integration of the races.

24:50.390 --> 24:52.953
They wanted to keep the separation of the races.

24:53.774 --> 24:56.998
Didn't work because the laws were against it.

24:57.434 --> 25:02.851
But it was great for a reporter because there was more news going on every day.

25:02.891 --> 25:07.967
You'd find something going on to write stories about.

25:08.403 --> 25:11.787
I never did any columns or opinion pieces.

25:11.847 --> 25:14.249
I just did straight news because that was my job.

25:16.432 --> 25:20.756
You want to go about the other part too?

25:20.916 --> 25:21.577
You went to Florida.

25:21.637 --> 25:22.618
You were at Florida State.

25:22.638 --> 25:24.640
That's when you first got into the education part of it.

25:24.660 --> 25:25.121
That's right.

25:25.201 --> 25:25.561
Yeah.

25:25.782 --> 25:26.002
Right.

25:26.242 --> 25:29.245
And in North Texas for 12 years and you've been at A&M since 1986.

25:29.285 --> 25:31.828
I taught at North Texas and then got

25:31.808 --> 25:59.385
picked up down here and then when the journalism department was abolished they pulled me over there to the agricultural leadership education communication teaching journalism and public relations public relations and a lot of your students want to go into public relations yes they do yeah right yeah in fact when when we had a journalism department the more than half of them want to go into public relations indeed yeah indeed

25:59.720 --> 26:03.567
In the time we have left, I want you to talk about your family.

26:03.608 --> 26:04.890
You mentioned that you were married in 1949.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.657
You were married for 54 years to Millie, and you lost her four years ago.

26:08.697 --> 26:09.339
Four years ago.

26:09.960 --> 26:16.733
You and Millie had five children, four who survived today, and I know you're very proud of them.

26:17.084 --> 26:23.215
But I don't want to get away without saying that this past April the 12th was a very special day for you.

26:23.235 --> 26:24.698
And I'll let you make the announcement.

26:25.019 --> 26:25.359
Go ahead.

26:25.379 --> 26:25.740
Okay.

26:26.261 --> 26:27.062
Yes.

26:27.583 --> 26:33.895
Well, I fell in love with a woman I met in 1954 when I first went to Mississippi.

26:34.229 --> 26:41.925
And she had a family, and I had a family, and we were together for a long, long time visiting back and forth.

26:42.847 --> 26:49.261
And then I got transferred over to Florida, and we would visit back and forth families.

26:49.281 --> 26:54.853
And then she got divorced and remarried, and her second husband died, and then my wife died.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.623
And last August, we renewed our acquaintance.

26:58.643 --> 27:00.626
And what's the date?

27:00.726 --> 27:05.213
Five days ago, we got married.

27:05.293 --> 27:08.357
Well, congratulations to you and Carolyn.

27:08.598 --> 27:13.205
And right now, I know it's a commuter marriage, but that's the way it goes.

27:13.405 --> 27:14.747
Well, things will change.

27:14.787 --> 27:16.249
You're very happy, and that'll change.

27:16.289 --> 27:16.730
Thank you.

27:16.750 --> 27:19.133
Thank you very much for your service, and thank you for being with us.

27:19.153 --> 27:20.055
Incredible story.

27:20.175 --> 27:21.537
Tom, I enjoyed it very much.

27:21.557 --> 27:22.258
Appreciate it.

27:22.238 --> 27:29.906
Douglas Starr's World War II experience started when he was 17, and before he was 20, he had seen a lifetime of history.

27:30.426 --> 27:40.076
