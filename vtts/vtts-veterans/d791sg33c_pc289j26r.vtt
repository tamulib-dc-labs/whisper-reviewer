Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.441 --> 00:33.582
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:34.152 --> 00:38.716
Charles Smith grew up in Bryan, graduated from EA Kemp High School in 1960.

00:39.637 --> 00:42.881
He's been back in Bryan for just seven years and proudly calls it home.

00:43.381 --> 00:44.963
But he was gone for 42 years.

00:45.323 --> 00:49.007
In between, 20 years in the Army, 22 working for the U.S.

00:49.027 --> 00:50.488
Postal Service in Fort Worth.

00:51.169 --> 00:58.116
In the Army between 1960 and 1981, he served a tour in Vietnam as a recon squad leader.

00:58.136 --> 01:00.598
But his duty there was cut short by malaria.

01:01.085 --> 01:05.209
He also served four separate tours of Germany and one in South Korea.

01:05.229 --> 01:11.614
More than four decades of public service has earned Charles Smith the retirement he now enjoys in West Bryan.

01:11.634 --> 01:14.517
Please welcome Charles Smith to Veterans of the Valley.

01:14.537 --> 01:18.240
It's an honor to know you, to meet you, and thank you for your service, and thank you for being here.

01:18.761 --> 01:19.341
Talk about you.

01:19.442 --> 01:20.763
You were born in the Brazos Valley.

01:20.883 --> 01:25.267
You graduated from EA camp in 1960, and you went pretty much straight into the Army.

01:25.287 --> 01:31.092
You were at Fort Hood, but then pretty soon you went overseas to Bamberg, Germany.

01:31.072 --> 01:32.714
Talk about your first duty assignment.

01:33.775 --> 01:38.741
Well, first of all, I graduated from aid camp on the 27th of May.

01:39.321 --> 01:42.284
Charles Allen and I went in there on the budget session.

01:42.304 --> 01:44.747
We was inducted in Houston, Texas.

01:45.168 --> 01:51.575
We left there and went to Fort Carson, Colorado, while we were in process and got all the equipment for basic training.

01:52.115 --> 01:53.637
Then moved back to Fort Hood.

01:54.089 --> 02:00.282
for Company D, 1st Battalion, 51st Infantry, while we had our basic training.

02:00.523 --> 02:13.410
Soon after that, seven weeks off, we went back in the AIT, and we've been the 1st Squadron, 15th Cavalry, while I've taken my scout training.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.713
Allen went to another company,

02:15.183 --> 02:39.553
for his his advanced training because we was only in and training basic training together and after that we split up i think he went to walfeck in germany and then i went to bamberg yeah and my unit assignment bamboo was his second squadron or seventh cavalry regiment right right now you were there uh 1961 uh that was the main year of the berlin crisis in 1961. talk about

02:39.533 --> 02:47.928
how that extended your duty, how that affected your duty in Germany, the Berlin crisis, because that's when Berlin was pretty much splitting up right about that time.

02:48.328 --> 02:55.200
During that time, we got orders that I will extend it to ETS at the end of service.

02:55.220 --> 02:59.668
So during that time, I thought about it and I

03:00.307 --> 03:02.791
I made a decision that I was going to stay in the Army.

03:02.952 --> 03:03.172
Right.

03:03.252 --> 03:04.695
Then I looked at long range.

03:04.715 --> 03:06.939
I said, well, I'll make the Army of my career.

03:06.959 --> 03:10.866
And so I ran this for six years and then came back to the States.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.190
And then that's when I moved to Fort Riley, Kansas.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.352
Right.

03:14.392 --> 03:15.674
After the 1963.

03:15.775 --> 03:16.616
Right, right.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.099
What was your duty in Bamberg, though?

03:18.139 --> 03:19.100
What did you do there?

03:19.181 --> 03:22.787
I mean, as it pertained to the Berlin crisis or anything else?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.831
I was assistant squad leader in the Scott section.

03:24.851 --> 03:25.352
Yeah.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.213
Assistant squad leader.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.898
I made a sergeant over there.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.221
And then I was assistant squad leader.

03:30.681 --> 03:37.153
And then also was assistant squad leader in full ride of cancer.

03:37.353 --> 03:37.654
I see.

03:38.039 --> 03:41.163
You came back to Fort Riley, 1963, spent there about two years.

03:41.223 --> 03:47.611
In 1965, you were assigned 25th Division to Hawaii, and that sort of set the path to Vietnam.

03:47.631 --> 03:52.397
Sort of, let's fast forward to that time and the time that you went in country to Vietnam.

03:52.417 --> 03:53.238
Talk about that.

03:53.258 --> 03:58.724
Yes, I rotated to Hawaii to the 4th of the 7th Cap.

03:58.744 --> 04:03.871
And then once I got there, we got orders that we were going to be deployed to Vietnam.

04:04.211 --> 04:04.692
Right.

04:04.972 --> 04:07.455
We left Hawaii,

04:07.756 --> 04:18.754
in January, by way of Okinawa, where we drew all our combat equipment, tested our equipment, and then we left there and went to LST to South Vietnam.

04:18.774 --> 04:23.803
I landed in Cuan Yang, and then the A-Troop, they went down to Coo Chi.

04:24.183 --> 04:24.384
Right.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.227
How long of an LST trip was that?

04:26.247 --> 04:26.708
Do you remember?

04:26.788 --> 04:27.309
Five days.

04:27.569 --> 04:28.130
Five days.

04:28.471 --> 04:29.292
Was that kind of rough?

04:29.879 --> 04:31.584
Well, the sea was calmer that time.

04:31.685 --> 04:34.554
You know, the LSD is a flat body boat.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.185
So the sea was calmer that entire trip was going over there.

04:38.485 --> 04:46.898
Talk about 19 Delta Recon, what the unit it was, and you were a recon specialist, right?

04:47.058 --> 04:47.278
Right.

04:47.599 --> 04:48.680
A reconnaissance specialist.

04:49.321 --> 04:55.310
Talk about what your duty was, what you were trained to do, sort of give us an idea of what the job was of recon.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.934
It was kind of a search and destroy type of outfit, right?

04:58.034 --> 05:06.467
Well, as a scout, you normally go out and your mission is to seek out the enemy through evasive maneuvers so you don't

05:06.785 --> 05:08.427
You don't want to be detected.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.090
So our job is basically to go out and find the enemy.

05:11.951 --> 05:16.416
So that's basically what the scouts would be doing, i.e.

05:16.436 --> 05:18.938
a recon troop would be doing to seek out the enemy.

05:19.259 --> 05:25.386
We'd go and find them, and then we'd move, wait for further assistance from other Army units to come up.

05:26.407 --> 05:27.368
Was it a dangerous job?

05:27.548 --> 05:28.129
Very dangerous.

05:28.749 --> 05:29.350
Very dangerous.

05:29.650 --> 05:30.591
In what way?

05:30.892 --> 05:31.472
Tell me.

05:32.974 --> 05:35.077
There were some testy times, obviously.

05:35.097 --> 05:39.322
Well, if you're in Vietnam, you don't know why the Vietcans are.

05:39.342 --> 05:40.063
You're in the jungle.

05:40.584 --> 05:43.287
You know, you have to move with caution.

05:44.048 --> 05:45.670
You know, so it's very dangerous.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.874
So you have to protect yourself and your fellow man.

05:49.195 --> 05:50.797
Right, right.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.702
You weren't directly involved in firefights, but you were on the outer edges of firefights.

05:54.762 --> 05:55.203
Is that right?

05:56.825 --> 05:57.546
Quite a few of them.

05:57.786 --> 05:58.006
Yeah.

05:58.507 --> 05:59.108
Quite a few of them.

05:59.308 --> 05:59.488
Yeah.

06:00.076 --> 06:13.430
You told me about one time that your actual, that you came in contact with the landmine, that your armored personnel carrier got blown up, right?

06:13.450 --> 06:19.717
Well, we was in an LZ, I can't recall the LZ right now, but in any way the... A landing zone, right?

06:19.757 --> 06:20.958
Right, it's a landing zone.

06:20.978 --> 06:24.362
We had set up a perimeter and normally about

06:24.612 --> 06:26.715
Once a day, we would get a hot meal.

06:26.735 --> 06:30.981
So my mission was to go back with my squad to receive a hot meal.

06:31.542 --> 06:35.127
And on the return trip back, that's when I hit a landmine.

06:35.167 --> 06:38.592
The front differential on the APC was blown completely off.

06:38.613 --> 06:39.394
The track was off.

06:39.914 --> 06:43.620
And the 50 caliber mounted on the PC was blown off.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.102
And I was blown back in the cargo hatch.

06:45.892 --> 06:46.793
Were you injured?

06:46.813 --> 06:47.454
No, not injured.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.197
Well, bumps on my head, stuff like that.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.381
It wasn't that serious.

06:51.401 --> 06:55.627
But you realized, there was one time you realized that you were in a war.

06:55.647 --> 06:56.909
Most definitely.

06:56.929 --> 06:57.811
And this was for real.

06:58.332 --> 07:02.839
But the armored personnel carrier, that's quite a vehicle, right?

07:02.899 --> 07:04.642
Talk a little bit about it.

07:04.662 --> 07:06.545
We're going to see a picture of one here in a little bit.

07:06.565 --> 07:11.292
But talk about that because that was your vehicle of transportation, right, was this?

07:11.423 --> 07:11.884
Right.

07:12.024 --> 07:16.629
Our vehicle configuration was that the scout section had four APCs.

07:17.450 --> 07:26.301
The platoon leader had an APC, and we had two tanks and an infantry carrier, which was also an APC, and then a multi-carrier M106.

07:26.661 --> 07:27.001
Right.

07:27.021 --> 07:30.025
So that was the recon configuration of vehicles we had.

07:30.245 --> 07:31.647
Right, right.

07:31.667 --> 07:36.132
And how many of these APCs were there in your division?

07:36.152 --> 07:39.456
I mean, you say there were four of them, is that right?

07:39.622 --> 07:41.385
In our platoon, it was five.

07:41.706 --> 07:46.434
Well, actually, five APC and an M106 motor carrier.

07:46.635 --> 07:47.015
Right.

07:47.095 --> 07:53.407
Because motor carrier is where you have the 4.2 motor on it, and then you can ground mount it and then work from it.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.569
Right, right.

07:54.589 --> 07:58.776
I think you described your, as a recon, you were sort of the eyes and the ears of the division.

07:58.977 --> 07:59.237
Right.

07:59.257 --> 08:01.702
Sort of continue with that.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.064
Sort of talk more about that.

08:03.398 --> 08:20.395
Usually when a troop or a squadron get a mission, a troop would get assigned a mission, and then we would go out and select the areas and flush out the enemy, seek the enemy, find out where they are, and then we would pull back to the squadron commander and then back to the division.

08:20.459 --> 08:45.673
right right what did a young charles smith think about at this time i mean you you're a young kid you just graduated from high school you did have the tour of germany so you had been overseas but now you were in vietnam you were in the vietnam war and you didn't know from day to day what the next day would bring what were your what do you recall now so many years later is what your thoughts were then as a young man well my thought was to stay alive yeah stay alive and and that we knew was in a dangerous situation

08:46.160 --> 08:53.136
So my job was to keep our troops motivated, my section motivated, so we can perform our mission.

08:53.637 --> 08:54.479
Yeah.

08:54.499 --> 08:54.719
Yeah.

08:55.661 --> 08:56.403
And it was dangerous.

08:56.824 --> 08:57.505
Very dangerous.

08:57.526 --> 08:59.049
It was dangerous work.

08:59.069 --> 08:59.189
Right.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.755
It was dangerous work.

09:02.613 --> 09:10.245
Malaria became a problem in Vietnam, especially as the monsoon season came along, because it would obviously bring along the mosquitoes.

09:10.265 --> 09:13.089
And six months into your tour, you contracted malaria.

09:13.149 --> 09:17.295
Talk about that, how you got sick, how you knew you were sick, and sort of where that took you.

09:18.036 --> 09:22.383
Well, for about two or three days, I noticed I was running kind of a high fever.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.845
I kept going to the medics.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.746
And then I think about the third day, my fever had reached about 105.

09:30.048 --> 09:39.860
So they had to medevac me back to the rear and then further medevac me to Natrang.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.942
I was treated in Natrang.

09:41.022 --> 09:48.211
And then after Natrang, I was sent back to the state to Johnson Field Hospital in Japan.

09:48.311 --> 09:50.674
That's why I stayed in Japan until I got cured.

09:50.995 --> 09:52.617
Right.

09:53.812 --> 09:54.453
Were you real sick?

09:54.833 --> 09:57.075
I mean, you had the fever, obviously.

09:57.295 --> 09:58.356
Oh, very sick, very sick.

09:58.856 --> 10:03.460
I think I spent about 30 days, 30 to 60 days in the train.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.041
In the hospital?

10:04.121 --> 10:05.302
In the hospital.

10:05.322 --> 10:07.724
Them just curing you there and just trying to get you.

10:07.764 --> 10:17.853
Well, use a medication, and they make sure that you have to use cold water to bring your temperature down fast, so they make sure the temperature didn't rise again.

10:18.093 --> 10:19.394
Right, right.

10:19.414 --> 10:21.075
That was the most dangerous thing about malaria.

10:21.296 --> 10:22.857
We were talking earlier about...

10:23.140 --> 10:27.582
malaria was really considered another enemy of

10:28.102 --> 10:53.535
another one of our enemies because it was affecting our troops and uh so we sprayed for malaria and the vietcong would sometimes go after those who were doing the spraying because they realized that malaria was part of what was helping them right yeah indeed um you finished your tour of vietnam and you went to uh tell us about you were at an r r uh station

10:53.515 --> 10:58.300
That's sort of how you finished up your tour overseas before you came back to the United States.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.322
Talk about that duty and what that involved.

11:00.702 --> 11:06.948
After I was discharged from the hospital, Johnsonville Hospital, I then moved to Camp Zama.

11:06.968 --> 11:07.409
In Japan.

11:07.569 --> 11:11.372
It's a Far East, a Far East overseas replacement company.

11:11.392 --> 11:16.437
Then we stayed there until we got orders coming back to a unit in the state.

11:17.198 --> 11:17.318
Right.

11:17.338 --> 11:22.223
And while I was there, I worked at the Ordnance Center, and then my job was there to

11:22.675 --> 11:25.666
get the guys coming out of Vietnam.

11:26.288 --> 11:29.882
They usually landed in Tachikawa, Air Force Base.

11:30.243 --> 11:32.652
Then we would take them back to Camp's Army and process them.

11:32.699 --> 11:33.060
Right.

11:33.280 --> 11:40.531
And then after the R&R, 7-day R&R is over, then we take them back and then get them on the plane, and then they will move, go back to Vietnam.

11:40.711 --> 11:41.051
I see.

11:41.312 --> 11:42.694
So they were going one way or the other.

11:42.714 --> 11:45.758
Some of them were going home, some of them were heading to Vietnam.

11:46.199 --> 11:48.883
Either way, it was sort of a processing center.

11:48.903 --> 11:49.043
Right.

11:49.484 --> 11:54.371
And that's where you worked for, what, about the last two or three months of your tour?

11:54.431 --> 11:54.852
Is that right?

11:55.453 --> 11:57.516
I worked there until I got orders to come back to the States.

11:57.536 --> 11:58.076
Okay.

11:58.097 --> 11:59.138
And then you came back to the States.

11:59.859 --> 12:02.503
Then they just moved you around like crazy after that.

12:02.737 --> 12:06.203
I was looking at it, and I think that I've got this right.

12:06.223 --> 12:16.542
You first went to Fort Hood, 2nd Armored Division, back to Fort Riley, and then you were back to Germany again, to Augburg, Germany, because it's the 24th.

12:17.023 --> 12:18.766
And now we're looking about 1967 to 1969.

12:18.806 --> 12:27.141
Talk about that tour of Germany, if you remember that in Augburg.

12:27.357 --> 12:32.542
That was the 2nd Battalion 7th Armour, Station Augsburg.

12:33.703 --> 12:39.588
Once I got there, then that's when I found out we were going to be redeployed back to Fort Riley.

12:39.688 --> 12:44.252
As you know, the 1st Division had been deployed to Vietnam.

12:44.392 --> 12:46.975
So the 24th came back to Fort Riley.

12:47.095 --> 12:51.119
And then I stayed there at Fort Riley with the 24th Division.

12:51.679 --> 12:55.002
Then we would go back to what they call a reforge operation.

12:55.302 --> 12:58.926
30 days, go up and do maneuvers, and then come back to Fort Riley.

12:59.066 --> 13:00.147
I see.

13:00.167 --> 13:00.468
I see.

13:01.429 --> 13:02.951
And then they move you some more.

13:02.971 --> 13:05.113
You wanted to go to Alaska.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.436
You had a friend that was in Alaska, said, come on up to Alaska.

13:07.456 --> 13:08.196
It's great up here.

13:08.277 --> 13:12.061
That's where you wanted to be assigned, but instead you were assigned to South Korea.

13:12.401 --> 13:15.365
Well, a friend of mine wrote me back and said, well, you know, you should come to Alaska.

13:15.385 --> 13:20.350
And I reenlisted and asked for Alaska, but then they sent me to Korea.

13:21.311 --> 13:22.072
Talk about that duty.

13:22.212 --> 13:22.913
What was that about?

13:23.315 --> 13:26.419
Korea was, I was with the 4th of the 7th Cavs in Korea.

13:28.102 --> 13:33.750
It was a duty that we was close to the DMZ.

13:33.830 --> 13:37.255
I was about a mile and a half from Freedom Bridge.

13:38.036 --> 13:38.616
Freedom Bridge.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.040
Just going across into the DMZ.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.425
I didn't do any DMZ operation, but we did go over there and train a lot.

13:44.805 --> 13:45.706
They had other units.

13:46.307 --> 13:51.815
Units rotate to go up on the DMZ to secure that area.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.237
Right, right.

13:53.757 --> 13:57.424
And then back to Fort Ord, California, a training command there.

13:57.504 --> 13:57.965
Is that right?

13:58.245 --> 13:58.445
Right.

13:58.586 --> 13:59.107
Talk about that.

13:59.768 --> 14:01.451
The training command, I was in a training command.

14:01.471 --> 14:02.312
I was an instructor.

14:02.833 --> 14:06.400
And then we basically trained it in AITs.

14:06.420 --> 14:16.137
And we basically trained them in squad tactics and leadership courses that we had right there in Fort Ord.

14:16.201 --> 14:16.601
Right.

14:16.842 --> 14:21.606
Now, this was in the early 70s, 70s, 73, right around there.

14:22.066 --> 14:23.548
So you were a trainer then.

14:23.568 --> 14:24.869
Now, what rank were you here then?

14:24.889 --> 14:26.010
Were you a sergeant then?

14:26.030 --> 14:26.851
I was a staff sergeant.

14:26.871 --> 14:28.232
You were a staff sergeant at that time.

14:28.832 --> 14:31.255
And then of all places, they're going to send you back to Germany.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.437
They figured that Charles Smith knew Germany pretty well.

14:33.457 --> 14:37.380
And this time, you went back to Bamberg, which had been your first deployment.

14:37.400 --> 14:37.780
Right.

14:37.921 --> 14:38.381
In Germany.

14:38.701 --> 14:44.086
I was with the second or second ACR, the Army Cavalry Regiment.

14:44.727 --> 14:46.208
And that...

14:46.441 --> 14:49.986
That tour of duty is why we pulled border patrol.

14:50.566 --> 14:53.731
We pulled border patrol out of Coburg, Germany.

14:54.251 --> 14:59.198
I had a tour up in Hof, and this unit, that's all they did was border patrol.

14:59.979 --> 15:11.234
I came back to the States in 70, latter part of 73 to 74, because my father was sick, and I got a compassionate reassignment back to Fort Hood again.

15:11.254 --> 15:11.955
Back to Fort Hood.

15:12.075 --> 15:12.936
Right.

15:13.237 --> 15:14.338
But you weren't through with Germany.

15:14.842 --> 15:20.092
Because you did another tour, a fourth tour of Germany, and this was at Schwabach?

15:20.432 --> 15:21.154
Schwabach, Germany.

15:21.214 --> 15:21.975
Schwabach, Germany.

15:22.236 --> 15:22.476
Right.

15:22.496 --> 15:23.057
Talk about that.

15:23.899 --> 15:28.788
That was, I was with the first of the first CAV, ACR.

15:28.808 --> 15:30.250
That's Army Caval Regiment.

15:30.852 --> 15:37.103
And we basically just trained, and we would go up and relieve the second ACR.

15:37.606 --> 15:38.969
on their boarding duty.

15:39.270 --> 15:44.421
And then at that point, I was a recon platoon sergeant then.

15:44.441 --> 15:44.802
I see.

15:47.288 --> 15:52.840
And then finally you came back to the United States for the final time, Fork Polk, Louisiana?

15:53.501 --> 15:55.245
That was your final assignment, right?

15:55.265 --> 15:57.370
Fork Polk, Louisiana, so I retired.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.401
Is that right?

15:58.642 --> 15:59.643
What would you do there?

15:59.663 --> 16:00.805
Were you in training there?

16:00.965 --> 16:02.027
Were you a trainer there too?

16:02.047 --> 16:06.974
I was in the 4th and 12th Cavalry, another cavalry unit, and then I was a recon between the sides and there.

16:07.054 --> 16:08.797
So a lot of training going on there, right?

16:08.837 --> 16:11.181
You were teaching other soldiers to be soldiers, right?

16:11.481 --> 16:20.515
Well, they was revamping Pope then for the, they call it in surgery training.

16:20.595 --> 16:21.096
In other words,

16:21.498 --> 16:27.685
close hand-to-hand combat in a town, in city, that kind of training.

16:28.786 --> 16:32.370
It's a big training post right now for the U.S.

16:32.390 --> 16:32.490
Army.

16:32.510 --> 16:38.156
Got a couple of photographs here, as a matter of fact, that Charles loaned to us and showed us, and I want to go to them.

16:38.176 --> 16:41.619
First, we're going to see a picture of young Charles Smith when he was 18 years old.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.623
So this is, I guess this is your enlistment photograph, is that right?

16:45.163 --> 16:45.363
Right.

16:45.984 --> 16:49.648
You're just a young kid, and they're just not knowing exactly where life's going to take you.

16:50.185 --> 16:52.128
But you're excited to be in the Army, it looks like.

16:52.830 --> 16:53.891
So you were 18 years old then?

16:53.911 --> 16:55.614
18 years old.

16:55.634 --> 16:56.356
Good-looking soldier.

16:57.377 --> 17:01.004
Talk about this unit, and where was this taken?

17:01.545 --> 17:03.708
This mission was taken in Fort Knox, Kentucky.

17:03.748 --> 17:09.158
It's an advanced NCO course, armored NCO course that is required for any senior NCO.

17:09.178 --> 17:12.143
So I had a chance to, it was a 12-week course.

17:12.494 --> 17:16.359
And that is the class picture we take him in.

17:16.379 --> 17:16.799
That's right.

17:16.919 --> 17:17.781
You're in the second row.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.244
You're standing next to the guy that appears to be out of uniform.

17:22.026 --> 17:22.626
He's a Marine.

17:22.887 --> 17:23.467
He's a Marine.

17:23.548 --> 17:23.808
OK.

17:25.069 --> 17:28.794
So he's the one Marine in the picture, and you're standing next to him.

17:28.814 --> 17:29.114
OK.

17:29.655 --> 17:34.561
And finally, I want to give people an idea of what the armored personnel carrier, what we're talking about.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.725
And that's a lot of machine there, Charles.

17:38.988 --> 17:43.234
That gave you some measure of safety, didn't it?

17:43.614 --> 17:46.117
Well, back then, yes, it did.

17:46.178 --> 17:51.765
But, you know, you have the armor around you, but, you know, an RPG can go through that.

17:52.226 --> 17:53.167
Oh, sure.

17:53.187 --> 17:53.667
Yeah.

17:53.688 --> 17:56.531
Now, the fellow that is in front, that's the driver, right?

17:56.671 --> 17:57.573
The driver.

17:57.593 --> 17:59.435
And then the fellow up top is the commander.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.597
That's the track commander.

18:00.617 --> 18:02.339
And it was a four-person crew, right?

18:02.359 --> 18:05.383
And the cargo hatch is open, and they have two gunners.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.731
on each side of the APC.

18:09.472 --> 18:12.495
Right.

18:12.515 --> 18:12.756
Wow.

18:14.718 --> 18:22.467
I asked you when we were visiting before if you had any ideas that you might be reassigned to Vietnam after you left the first time.

18:22.487 --> 18:30.417
And you didn't really think so, not only because you were an only surviving son, but also because of the malaria, you were pretty sure that you wouldn't be assigned back to Vietnam, right?

18:30.437 --> 18:31.438
And eventually I never did.

18:31.799 --> 18:31.979
Right.

18:31.999 --> 18:34.041
I never come back when I was going back to Vietnam.

18:34.061 --> 18:34.662
Right, right.

18:34.912 --> 18:41.281
Stayed in Lafayette for three months there at Fort Polk, and then your life just took a whole change.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.993
You retired from the Army in 1981?

18:44.480 --> 18:45.321
January 1.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.142
Right.

18:46.162 --> 18:49.047
And you had some sisters up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, so you went up there.

18:49.107 --> 18:52.532
I have a sister living in Fort Worth and one live in Dallas.

18:52.552 --> 18:53.493
Right, right.

18:53.513 --> 18:58.921
I stayed with my sister in Fort Worth for about three months, and then I got hired into the Postal Service.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.224
So you just thought you were through working for the federal government.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.347
You had another 22 years to work for them, right?

19:03.528 --> 19:04.549
I was living for another career.

19:06.292 --> 19:06.953
Talk about that.

19:06.973 --> 19:10.978
Talk about two decades in Fort Worth with the Postal Service.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.040
What did you do up there?

19:12.880 --> 19:23.033
Well, the Postal Service, I was an AFC operator, an advanced official counsel machine that counseled all first-class mail.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.517
And I worked on that machine for 18 years.

19:26.537 --> 19:26.757
Right.

19:27.578 --> 19:32.104
And then I retired from that in 2002.

19:32.584 --> 19:32.925
I see.

19:33.566 --> 19:36.149
So you just went to work every day working on that machine?

19:36.169 --> 19:36.289
Right.

19:36.607 --> 19:38.830
Was it good work?

19:38.970 --> 19:42.093
I mean, you obviously spent 22 years in Fort Worth.

19:42.133 --> 19:45.057
You obviously got fond of the area, I guess, right?

19:45.557 --> 19:50.563
Well, the machine operator was, you didn't have to be supervised because nobody knew what you were doing.

19:50.764 --> 19:50.984
Right.

19:51.004 --> 19:53.867
So you take your job seriously.

19:53.887 --> 19:54.968
You cancel the letters.

19:55.009 --> 19:57.792
All the supervisors want you to do is keep the machine going.

19:57.812 --> 19:58.072
Right.

19:58.092 --> 20:02.277
That was basically your primary mission, keep the machine going so it wouldn't shut down.

20:02.257 --> 20:04.359
Were you working around people that were generally your age?

20:04.399 --> 20:08.703
Were there other veterans that you were working with also, other Vietnam veterans?

20:09.003 --> 20:12.106
Quite a few veterans in the postal service that I was working with.

20:12.126 --> 20:12.486
Right.

20:12.506 --> 20:16.530
And then, of course, we had young ones that came in that wasn't veterans.

20:16.630 --> 20:17.911
I also worked with them, too.

20:17.931 --> 20:19.313
Right, right, right.

20:20.313 --> 20:21.695
So 22 years there.

20:21.875 --> 20:29.682
And then talk about the decision after essentially 42 years away from Brian, you made the decision to come back.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.662
come back to Bryant, the place where you grew up.

20:33.123 --> 20:35.685
Talk about that decision rather than staying in Dallas-Fort Worth.

20:35.725 --> 20:36.646
What made you come back home?

20:37.667 --> 20:40.830
Well, I have a lot of property here in this area.

20:41.271 --> 20:48.037
The home house, we have some land out in Rita, Texas.

20:48.057 --> 20:53.583
And then much of my business was centered around Bryant, the Brazos Valley.

20:54.163 --> 20:59.128
So I thought it was a good idea for me to move back and so I was close to the business ventures that

20:59.615 --> 21:01.918
If I needed to take care of something, I was here to take care of it.

21:01.938 --> 21:02.779
Right, right.

21:02.799 --> 21:04.782
So I moved back to make brine courses.

21:04.942 --> 21:05.643
Oh, where's my home?

21:05.663 --> 21:07.786
So I just made it official.

21:07.926 --> 21:08.266
Right.

21:08.787 --> 21:15.315
And you moved into a house that actually you rebuilt on the same spot where it is now that had been your mother's house.

21:15.395 --> 21:15.916
Is that right?

21:16.377 --> 21:20.943
My baby sister was born in a house and my mother in 1990 built a new one.

21:21.303 --> 21:21.503
Right.

21:21.523 --> 21:22.725
And I promised I'd take care of it.

21:22.745 --> 21:24.768
So I moved back in the house now.

21:25.068 --> 21:25.288
Right.

21:25.348 --> 21:26.029
That's where I'm living.

21:26.209 --> 21:27.411
And that's where you're still living now.

21:28.100 --> 21:41.695
Having grown up in the Brazos Valley, graduated in 1960, I guess you've seen a lot of changes in Bryan and College Station and the university area and all of that in the years since you first went to school here.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.337
The place has changed a lot, hasn't it?

21:43.958 --> 21:49.444
I've been here seven years, I'm still getting lost.

21:49.765 --> 21:50.966
All those new streets there.

21:51.547 --> 21:56.352
Well, you know, sometimes you got to get your GPS out and either look at a map or

21:56.635 --> 21:59.999
You know, A&M has grown since I left.

22:00.880 --> 22:06.307
When I left, I think A&M was an all-male college, which didn't go according to 1968.

22:06.667 --> 22:07.388
Exactly.

22:07.509 --> 22:12.775
So you can see the tremendous growth that A&M has had since I left and came back.

22:12.935 --> 22:13.796
Right, right.

22:14.297 --> 22:15.118
Talk about your family.

22:15.158 --> 22:17.901
You have a son who lives here.

22:18.142 --> 22:18.602
Is that right?

22:18.803 --> 22:19.744
I have a son who lives here.

22:19.824 --> 22:21.226
He has one son himself.

22:21.266 --> 22:22.707
He works in the oil industry.

22:22.928 --> 22:23.248
I see.

22:23.508 --> 22:23.809
I see.

22:24.269 --> 22:26.372
And you have a daughter who is a nurse in Topeka.

22:26.588 --> 22:28.211
I have a daughter, and she has two kids.

22:28.592 --> 22:28.973
Right.

22:29.013 --> 22:31.397
Daughter and son-in-law that live up there, right?

22:31.417 --> 22:31.958
Right.

22:32.620 --> 22:36.567
My daughter has two kids, one son and a daughter.

22:36.587 --> 22:40.595
My granddaughter, she's taking a course in journalism.

22:41.557 --> 22:47.989
And my grandson is going to the University of Kansas to be an engineer, and then he's on track.

22:48.475 --> 22:48.856
Right.

22:48.876 --> 22:50.318
Now, I know you're really proud of that.

22:50.838 --> 22:53.722
He's just graduated from high school, right?

22:53.742 --> 22:53.863
Right.

22:53.883 --> 22:57.408
So he'll be a freshman at the University of Kansas, and he got himself a track scholarship.

22:57.508 --> 22:57.748
Right.

22:58.249 --> 23:01.173
And your son-in-law used to be a coach.

23:01.193 --> 23:04.558
He's going to quit coaching so he can watch his son run track.

23:04.578 --> 23:04.858
Is that right?

23:04.878 --> 23:12.729
Well, he decided to stop coaching, and he's just going to teach, and so he can be available to help his son with his track.

23:12.749 --> 23:13.030
Right.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.413
And getting through the college there.

23:15.433 --> 23:18.297
You talked about one time recently that you were up there visiting your...

23:19.036 --> 23:25.604
your daughter and your son-in-law and your grandkids, and you decided to stop by Fort Riley just to see the old place, and you didn't recognize much.

23:25.684 --> 23:26.485
Is that right?

23:26.505 --> 23:27.326
Grown tremendously.

23:27.987 --> 23:29.950
I got lost going up in Custer Hill.

23:29.970 --> 23:32.753
I had to get a map just to get it on post.

23:32.773 --> 23:37.679
Of course, you know, with 9-11, Fort Riley used to be an open post.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.161
Now it's completely enclosed.

23:39.602 --> 23:43.526
So you must have a DOD decal to go in and out of the post now.

23:43.767 --> 23:44.027
Right.

23:44.187 --> 23:47.391
So it's really have grown since 1960.

23:47.572 --> 23:48.773
Yeah.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.161
Or even when you retired in 1981.

23:50.202 --> 23:50.402
Right.

23:51.303 --> 23:53.245
Things have changed a lot.

23:53.265 --> 24:02.315
Charles, when you look back at your career, your 42 years, 20 years in the Army, and 22 years working for the Postal Service, is there anything that you'd change?

24:02.335 --> 24:05.819
Would you have done it all over again the same way?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.802
I feel if I had to, I'd do it again.

24:09.142 --> 24:09.543
Right.

24:09.563 --> 24:10.644
I'd do it all over again.

24:10.664 --> 24:10.804
Yeah?

24:11.505 --> 24:11.605
Yeah.

24:14.048 --> 24:21.115
So our forefathers and the things we went through, the World War II veterans, they made it possible for us.

24:21.556 --> 24:23.558
So if I had to, I would do it over again.

24:23.778 --> 24:24.078
Right.

24:24.759 --> 24:35.890
You come in contact now with a lot of veterans, not only Vietnam veterans, but World War II veterans also, because you are very involved with military organizations like the VFW.

24:36.070 --> 24:42.997
You've been with them for a long time, Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, Vietnam Veterans Association, Elks Lodge.

24:43.017 --> 24:44.038
Talk about your...

24:44.322 --> 24:47.587
your involvement with that, especially VFW, where you're Officer of the Day.

24:47.627 --> 24:48.048
Is that right?

24:48.669 --> 24:48.869
Right.

24:48.930 --> 24:51.434
Well, I've been with the VFW for 27 years.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.580
On my cap, you see my hash mark only comes for 25.

24:55.620 --> 25:00.388
Three more years, I'll be able to put another hash mark, which gave me 30.

25:01.189 --> 25:04.996
I've been with the American Legion for 13 years.

25:05.036 --> 25:09.503
Disabled Veterans of America, I've been with them 21 years.

25:09.702 --> 25:15.089
Vietnam Veterans of America and the Elks Lodge, I've been with them three years, three years each.

25:15.449 --> 25:17.632
Right, right, right.

25:18.373 --> 25:21.217
Proud of your involvement with them, VFW especially.

25:21.317 --> 25:39.000
Obviously, it's an active organization here, but you're looking for new and you're looking for younger members over there at the VFW because folks like you and I and the World War II veterans, we're not getting any younger, so we need the younger people to get involved, the younger veterans that are coming back from Desert Storm or even Iraq and Afghanistan, right?

25:39.402 --> 25:42.005
I'm part of the recruiting committee.

25:42.345 --> 25:42.726
Okay.

25:42.746 --> 25:45.729
And we're waiting for the... Do some recruiting here.

25:46.230 --> 25:48.252
...national to come out with a new Bruce here.

25:49.714 --> 26:06.593
They're coming out with a stand-up policy, how to recruit, and then we're getting their Bruce here, and then we're going to streamline ours as to how we can go out and track new, especially the Iraqi and the Afghanistan veterans.

26:06.613 --> 26:07.975
Of course, you've got the Delta Storm.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.337
Right.

26:09.557 --> 26:10.618
Young veterans we're trying to get.

26:10.979 --> 26:11.520
Right.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.103
The VFW has also adopted a unit.

26:14.304 --> 26:17.628
We also have the 420th Engineer Battalion.

26:18.269 --> 26:20.632
It's one of our adopted units.

26:20.652 --> 26:20.773
I see.

26:20.793 --> 26:22.335
So we work with them very closely.

26:22.355 --> 26:22.876
I see.

26:22.896 --> 26:23.497
I see.

26:23.517 --> 26:35.574
So if you're talking to a young veteran who's coming home right now or that aren't involved in VFW or an organization like that, what do you tell them?

26:35.674 --> 26:36.595
Why should they get involved?

26:37.233 --> 26:43.120
Well, we try to educate them as to what the VAF numbers does.

26:44.281 --> 26:46.424
We're a non-profit organization.

26:47.425 --> 26:48.446
We're there for veterans.

26:48.546 --> 26:49.327
We help veterans.

26:50.148 --> 26:54.173
And all our veterans organization, you have service officers.

26:54.193 --> 27:00.880
So if you have a young veteran coming back that need assistance in filing claims, we have service officers in these organizations that can help them.

27:01.161 --> 27:01.401
Right.

27:01.769 --> 27:03.651
Right, so it's obviously to their benefit.

27:03.691 --> 27:07.154
And I know that you all have a lot of programs for youth and for kids.

27:07.214 --> 27:13.139
You have the Patriot's Pen, you have the Voice of Democracy program and all of that.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.800
So it's a wonderful organization.

27:14.941 --> 27:16.362
You all don't just get over there and party.

27:16.382 --> 27:19.825
You actually do some community service, right?

27:19.985 --> 27:22.707
And that's what you want people to know.

27:23.188 --> 27:24.409
That's right.

27:24.449 --> 27:27.311
You've had a remarkable career of service.

27:27.351 --> 27:31.455
And like I asked you, you said that you would do it all again if you had to

27:31.672 --> 27:33.635
to do it all over again.

27:33.715 --> 27:41.166
And you've had some health problems, you've had some health issues, but right now you look fit as a fiddle, so you're taking care of yourself.

27:41.727 --> 27:42.528
You don't worry about it.

27:42.848 --> 27:43.008
Yeah.

27:43.309 --> 27:47.815
I had an open heart surgery in 95, so I just take one day at a time.

27:47.855 --> 27:50.900
You just get up, go do your exercise, and move on.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.302
Whole new lease on life, right?

27:53.323 --> 27:54.445
Thank you for your service.

27:54.465 --> 27:55.406
And thank you for being here.

27:55.486 --> 27:55.907
Thank you.

27:56.562 --> 28:06.953
In his retirement, Charles Smith does stay involved as a member of several military organizations, like we said, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Elks Lodge.

28:06.973 --> 28:16.284
And you can bet that he'll be making his way to Kansas when he can to watch his grandson run track for the Jayhawks, a well-deserved retirement after more than 40 years of government service.

28:16.304 --> 28:17.946
We salute Charles Smith for his service.

28:18.606 --> 28:19.507
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:19.687 --> 28:22.030
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
