Welcome to another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:30.946 --> 00:36.335
He was born during the Depression years in Jenkins, Kentucky, just north of Harlan County.

00:36.355 --> 00:39.400
His mother was a nurse and his dad was a coal miner.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.427
He says they were the quintessential hillbillies, just like you'd see in a movie.

00:43.948 --> 00:56.228
And yes, they did owe their souls to the company store, just like the line in the song 16 Ton says, written by Merle Travis back in 47 and made famous by Tennessee Ernie Ford in 1955.

00:56.208 --> 01:08.300
He joined the Marine Corps in 1948 at the ripe old age of 17, stayed in for one year, was out of the Marines for about eight months when he got called back up on 27th July, 1950.

01:09.240 --> 01:17.008
And on 15th September, 1950, less than two months later, he made the landing at Incheon, Korea with 5th Marines.

01:17.508 --> 01:20.291
Veterans of the Valley welcomes Hugh Shockey, U.S.

01:20.311 --> 01:22.333
Marine, to today's show.

01:22.313 --> 01:23.877
Mr. Shockey, thank you for being with us.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.260
Nice to be here, Kyle.

01:25.320 --> 01:25.681
Thank you.

01:26.563 --> 01:28.288
Tell us what it was like right then.

01:28.308 --> 01:37.470
You got called back up, and within just a month and a half, you were making the transition and stepping off into Korea.

01:38.767 --> 01:53.494
Well, in July of 1950, when they called me on active duty and thousands of other Marines, it was to fill the void that the Marine Corps had because they had been cut back so deeply after World War II.

01:54.556 --> 01:57.501
And those of us that

01:57.481 --> 02:04.351
had any experience in the Marine Corps at all, were eligible for combat in some form or fashion.

02:04.371 --> 02:21.177
And so we all went to Camp Pendleton, California, and they processed us medically and physically and checked our personnel records and determined that I was to go to Korea in the next week or two.

02:21.157 --> 02:29.532
And we arrived at Camp Pendleton on August the 2nd and on August the 13th I was aboard ship headed for Korea.

02:29.552 --> 02:32.397
Me and 5,000 other Marines on that ship.

02:32.417 --> 02:44.177
And we landed in Kobe, Japan and disembarked from that ship and embarked another ship and went to Pusan, Korea on the 3rd of August.

02:45.372 --> 03:11.667
no, that date's wrong, on the 3rd of September, and boarded another ship, and when we boarded that ship, the troops that were on my ship were designated as the 5th Marines, and we joined the 1st Marine Brigade, which is a Marines unit that was in Korea at the time, and then suddenly we then became the 5th Marine Regiment of the 1st Marine Division, and so we went on and made the landing at Incheon as the 5th Marines.

03:11.647 --> 03:26.303
And it was a, we had very, we didn't have much opposition at Inchon, not where I was, although the island was, Whamido was the island we landed on, which was north of the city of Inchon.

03:26.903 --> 03:39.016
And there were some anxious moments because they had such a high tide there that we went in at high tide, and at low tide is 30 feet shallower, and there's just mudflats for miles out into the ocean.

03:39.476 --> 03:40.978
And there are ships,

03:40.958 --> 03:42.221
SITTING THERE HIGH AND DRY.

03:42.421 --> 03:47.832
SO ANYBODY ON LAND, FOR PEOPLE COMING IN FROM BOATS OR SOMETHING TO HELP AND SUPPORT, YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.017
YOU JUST HAD TO WAIT TILL THE TIDE CAME BACK IN.

03:50.037 --> 03:57.212
AND WHEN THE TIDE CAME BACK IN, WE WENT ON AND MOVED FROM THE ISLAND ACROSS THE LITTLE BAY, A BRIDGE, AND ONTO THE MAINLAND.

03:57.252 --> 04:01.701
AND FROM THERE, WE MOVED NORTH THROUGH

04:01.681 --> 04:04.006
Pohang was the name of one of the towns.

04:04.487 --> 04:08.235
We took Kempo Airfield, which is on the south side of the Han River.

04:08.836 --> 04:11.121
On the north side of the Han River is the city of Seoul.

04:11.722 --> 04:20.601
We went across the river without any opposition to speak of and eventually took the city of Seoul.

04:21.290 --> 04:38.995
And about one month after we landed at Inchon, on or about the 16th of October, we left Inchon, headed south, and boarded ships, and went around the southern tip of the peninsula to make what was going to be the landing at Wonson.

04:39.751 --> 04:43.215
We weren't able to make our landing timely because there's so many mines out in the water.

04:43.255 --> 04:46.499
The minesweepers had a tough time cleaning that water up for us to get in.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.683
So by the time we got in, that one sign had been secured.

04:50.404 --> 04:56.051
And so much to the point that Bob Hope had already had a USO show there before we got there.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.693
And y'all were still sitting out in the back.

04:57.713 --> 05:00.156
Yeah, we're out in the water and he's having a show.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.299
And so...

05:02.279 --> 05:05.406
And Bob Hope used that line many times in one of his shows.

05:05.426 --> 05:08.372
This is, I'm Bob, I met you at Juan San Hope.

05:08.733 --> 05:11.518
Anytime was appearing before Marines, and they all knew what that meant.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.228
And from there, we began our trek north to the Chosin Reservoir.

05:17.852 --> 05:19.816
Had a lot of opposition going up there.

05:19.916 --> 05:20.457
What was that like?

05:21.162 --> 05:22.324
Well, it was just cold.

05:22.564 --> 05:28.151
I mean, the farther we went north and the higher in elevations we went to, the temperature just got bitterly cold.

05:28.171 --> 05:36.662
I mean, it was so cold that the way you describe the effect it has on you is life begins to take on slow motion.

05:36.682 --> 05:40.067
You think in slow motion, you act in slow motion.

05:40.147 --> 05:43.231
You don't know it, but you are doing this.

05:43.251 --> 05:46.615
And that's the kind of effect that cold weather has on you.

05:46.635 --> 05:50.140
And besides that, we did not have the best gear for cold weather.

05:50.288 --> 05:51.950
We didn't have thermal boots that year.

05:52.231 --> 06:00.202
We had what we called shoe packs, which were just rubber-soled boots that were about calf high, and they were made out of leather and fabric.

06:00.243 --> 06:03.627
So once that gets wet, you know, you're dead to water.

06:03.828 --> 06:07.453
And if you don't keep your feet dry, you're gonna get

06:07.433 --> 06:08.856
frostbite real quick.

06:08.916 --> 06:19.995
So much of the time we were taking our socks off, drying our feet off, putting dry socks off, putting our wet socks inside our jackets and our shirts around our body heat so that we could dry them out.

06:20.015 --> 06:24.183
So the next time we needed some dry socks, we'd use them and we'd swap it out.

06:24.203 --> 06:29.492
And we got up on the east side of the Chosin Reservoir, the 5th Marines did, and we set up

06:29.995 --> 06:51.628
our defensive positions, and shortly after we got there, we were relieved by the 31st Regiment of the 7th Army Division, and we were pulled out from the east side of the Chosin Reservoir and sent to the northwest side of the Chosin Reservoir, where the 7th Marines were already there, and the 7th Marine Regiment.

06:52.489 --> 06:57.657
And that's when, shortly after Thanksgiving, the Chinese broke through.

06:57.637 --> 06:59.820
And it was tough.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.383
I mean, there were just Chinese everywhere.

07:02.403 --> 07:04.445
We called them chinks.

07:04.806 --> 07:08.510
In deference to the North Koreans, we called those gooks.

07:08.530 --> 07:14.638
I've been politically incorrect speaking like that, but that's history says that's the way it was.

07:14.658 --> 07:20.505
And we began to withdraw, but we were surrounded.

07:20.485 --> 07:22.289
on all sides.

07:22.469 --> 07:36.638
And this winding mountain road to Hagaroo, which was at the southern tip of the reservoir, and we're in the northwestern edge,

07:36.770 --> 07:45.005
goes through a thing called Tong Kong Pass, and the 5th Marine, the 7th Marines had left a group there to keep that pass open for us.

07:45.827 --> 07:47.910
And boy, those guys did a heck of a job.

07:47.930 --> 07:58.630
They lost a lot of men, but they kept that group, that pass open so that two regiments, Marines and all their equipment, and the Marines and the dead Marines could be pulled out of there.

07:59.071 --> 07:59.672
We made it.

08:00.277 --> 08:07.645
with a whole lot of suffering and the cold was just terrible and the Chinese were everywhere.

08:08.586 --> 08:23.803
And we got down to Hageroo and that is where the whole division then joined together to make its last about 40 mile march down the mountains to Hamheng, which is on the coast of North Korea.

08:24.475 --> 08:34.788
And in the process of doing this, we had to break roadblocks that ever wind and turn in the road as we would go around to make this curve from left to right.

08:34.828 --> 08:40.174
We had to knock off the enemy on this hill so we could make the turn and go back to the next turn.

08:40.194 --> 08:43.218
And those guys were climbing up and down those mountains.

08:43.418 --> 08:45.781
So it would be move a little, stop and fight a little.

08:46.001 --> 08:48.684
Oh, it would just forever stop.

08:48.725 --> 08:51.388
The train would just stop.

08:51.408 --> 08:53.250
And here's what I'd like to put a...

08:56.504 --> 08:59.495
put General Ray Murray in the story.

08:59.897 --> 09:07.645
General Ray Murray was a Lieutenant Colonel commanding a 5th Marine Regiment at that time, the only Lieutenant Colonel commanding a Marine Regiment of all the Marine Corps.

09:08.249 --> 09:09.892
And he's an Aggie.

09:10.272 --> 09:14.799
He was a 1935 graduate at Texas A&M, and boy was he a Marine's Marine.

09:15.460 --> 09:30.544
This guy saved a lot of Marines' lives just walking up and down this train where guys were just sitting down just dead tired, sitting in freezing weather like 35 below zero with a wind chill maybe as high as 60.

09:31.148 --> 09:33.732
He'd kick guys in the butt and get them up and make them move.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.597
So 30 minutes, he'd sit down and freeze to death.

09:37.378 --> 09:40.022
And he spent a lot of time doing that.

09:40.042 --> 09:47.494
And, you know, he could have just been sitting in a warm Jeep somewhere with a heater on, but not Ray Murray, not Ray Murray.

09:47.835 --> 09:51.621
He died recently, and the Marine Corps lost a great man in him.

09:52.192 --> 10:00.605
Anyway, we came out of there and eventually boarded ship at Hongnam, went down around the peninsula again to Maison, Korea.

10:01.386 --> 10:05.954
And that's where the 1st Marine Division reconnoitered, got our strength back up.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.696
We called it the Bean Patch.

10:08.578 --> 10:14.126
And there are a lot of stories about the Bean Patch that I could tell you sometime later.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.769
One of them is politically controversial.

10:16.643 --> 10:20.455
significant today, but we'll leave that as it is right now.

10:20.475 --> 10:21.780
We'll leave that for another show.

10:21.860 --> 10:22.181
Yeah.

10:23.947 --> 10:28.341
But we, in about 30 days, we got our Marine Division back in shape.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.240
And we moved north.

10:30.320 --> 10:35.649
And one of our jobs for the first month was just clearing up what we call line crossers.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.254
So you couldn't tell the difference between the North Korean and the South Korean.

10:38.274 --> 10:41.259
How do you tell somebody from North Dallas and South Dallas?

10:41.279 --> 10:41.399
Right.

10:41.419 --> 10:42.481
You can't do that.

10:42.501 --> 10:43.843
So these people all looked alike.

10:43.903 --> 10:47.048
And these guys were line crossers, and they were blowing up things behind us.

10:47.409 --> 10:49.112
So our job was to clean them up.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.055
We'll do whatever we had to do to get them out of there.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.633
And we were able to do that.

10:53.693 --> 10:58.512
We started putting curfews on people after six o'clock.

10:58.532 --> 11:02.648
If you weren't in a compound and you were civilian, you might be shot.

11:02.712 --> 11:13.021
So we built compounds for them, facilities for them to live in, we fed them, they were safe, and that's how we cleaned that mess up.

11:13.041 --> 11:32.719
One little side story about that is I looked in one of these places one day, and inside this fence sitting by a big old potbelly, open cauldron, boiling water, I don't know what they had in it, and this little Korean kid, might be two years old, no clothes on, snotty nose, and I'm thinking, you know,

11:32.699 --> 11:36.945
Boy, I sure wouldn't want to look out my back window in my backyard and see that happening.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.627
Maybe that's one of the reasons we're here.

11:38.787 --> 11:39.208
I don't know.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.850
We never thought about that much.

11:40.890 --> 11:42.853
We were just doing our job.

11:43.574 --> 11:51.264
But from then on, the Marines and the 8th Army just kept pushing the enemy north, north, north, north, north.

11:51.404 --> 11:57.913
And in July of 1951, I...

11:58.602 --> 12:10.907
was a wireman with the 5th Marines and I was up on the hill with 1st Battalion and we had to lay the communications line between our regimental to the next unit

12:11.174 --> 12:13.379
down, which was the battalion.

12:14.842 --> 12:29.132
One of my jobs when I got the battalion was to see if the battalion needed anybody in communications to help them get their communications installed before nightfall because we were moving out every day.

12:29.112 --> 12:42.215
That one day I was needed, so I went up to the company on the hill, and they had an OP with a machine gun sitting out, oh, probably 75 yards from a platoon leader's position.

12:42.916 --> 12:50.850
And they said they wanted to run a telephone line from platoon leader's position to the machine gun nest.

12:51.168 --> 12:52.550
It was a sound-powered telephone.

12:52.611 --> 12:59.523
It was just a battery operated on both ends through a two-pair wire running between them, and you'd see people talk through the cans, you know.

12:59.543 --> 13:04.672
Well, this was a battery powered so they could transmit, you know, verbiage through it.

13:05.133 --> 13:12.867
Well, I get out there, and the Koreans were real good with a 180 mortar, I mean a 120-millimeter mortar.

13:12.907 --> 13:14.710
They could shoot those things like rifles.

13:14.730 --> 13:15.792
They were really sharp.

13:16.193 --> 13:19.798
And they put one right in the middle of that machine gun nest.

13:19.818 --> 13:20.439
The one you were in.

13:20.459 --> 13:22.301
The one I'm in there putting this telephone.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.685
I'm just there picking two wires on the telephone.

13:24.725 --> 13:26.307
Really, that's all I had to do.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.271
But while I was there, direct hit hit that thing.

13:29.671 --> 13:33.537
There were four guys in there, me and three of them, the machine gunner and his two helpers and me.

13:34.498 --> 13:36.080
And it just collapsed that thing.

13:36.140 --> 13:40.506
It had sandbags on top of it and everything that they had built there to secure themselves.

13:41.147 --> 13:43.450
And they overran that position.

13:44.729 --> 13:48.014
And the Marines should get back on the hill for two days.

13:48.034 --> 13:51.578
And I'm in that hole under all that sandbags and all that stuff.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.882
And I was the only one that survived to come out of there.

13:54.342 --> 13:56.565
And you were probably 18 years old?

13:57.166 --> 13:57.707
Yeah.

13:57.747 --> 13:58.808
Had you made 18 by then?

13:58.828 --> 13:59.770
Oh, yeah, I was 18.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.353
I was 18 in December previous.

14:02.413 --> 14:06.659
But, yeah, that's just, well, that's what Marines do.

14:07.000 --> 14:07.901
And that's what I did.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.984
And I knew they'd be back, man.

14:10.044 --> 14:12.247
I just knew there wasn't any doubt in my mind.

14:12.287 --> 14:13.909
My buddies would come and get me.

14:13.889 --> 14:20.666
And for two days I heard Chinese spoke around me, or Korean, I don't know which one, but I don't remember that.

14:22.049 --> 14:23.934
So you could actually hear them outside?

14:23.954 --> 14:25.418
Oh, I could hear them talking, yeah.

14:25.438 --> 14:27.363
They drugged that gun out of that hole there.

14:27.764 --> 14:31.493
I didn't see them do it, I could hear them do it, because I could see anything.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.449
The guys came back, took that hill, dug me out of there.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.494
I went by to see the corpsman.

14:39.516 --> 14:47.895
You did tell me earlier, though, in our interview that basically you kind of gave a little bit of a signal once you heard the Americans come back.

14:49.023 --> 14:51.749
Marines hymn means a lot of things to a lot of people.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.873
Marine hymn means Marines around somewhere.

14:54.194 --> 14:59.825
When I heard these guys talking, when I first heard English after two days, I started singing a Marines hymn and they dug me out.

14:59.845 --> 15:01.008
That's how they knew I was in there.

15:01.629 --> 15:04.956
I never said it made a sound while the Chinese or the Koreans were there.

15:05.476 --> 15:08.879
There wasn't any reason for me to be a prisoner of theirs.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.981
I just knew my guys would come and get me, and they did.

15:11.001 --> 15:12.222
I can imagine the looks on their faces.

15:12.242 --> 15:16.507
They hear this muffled sound of someone singing the Marine hymn.

15:16.527 --> 15:19.289
They probably thought it was a drunk Marine somewhere.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.972
But I didn't have anything to eat or drink for two days.

15:22.993 --> 15:24.274
But I was in good shape.

15:24.514 --> 15:26.036
I went to the corpsman.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.757
They gave me a couple of shots or something.

15:27.817 --> 15:31.821
And I went and got a hot meal, and that was it.

15:31.921 --> 15:33.643
I was on my way to do my job.

15:34.079 --> 15:36.722
And shortly after that, I came home.

15:36.742 --> 15:44.429
And I went to an Oakland Naval Hospital, and I had amoebic dysentery, so they kept me there about three weeks.

15:45.250 --> 15:50.455
And I got on liberty one day, and this is my little final story probably.

15:50.475 --> 15:58.203
There was a guy who came to Korea and gave a show for the USO.

15:58.223 --> 15:59.605
His name was Earl Garner.

16:00.345 --> 16:01.707
Earl Garner's a piano player.

16:01.907 --> 16:02.027
Right.

16:02.446 --> 16:04.591
And I just loved Earl Garner's music.

16:04.611 --> 16:08.940
His touch on the piano was just something that would just captivate me.

16:09.842 --> 16:12.688
And he played a song called Misty.

16:13.870 --> 16:14.111
Right.

16:15.053 --> 16:18.139
But he had never written any words for it.

16:18.159 --> 16:19.943
So he was going to write some words for it someday.

16:20.224 --> 16:23.290
But anyhow, well, he didn't know when.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.851
So I'm at Oakland Naval Hospital.

16:25.871 --> 16:26.673
I go on Labor Day.

16:26.693 --> 16:30.078
They give us passes when we go out of that hospital to any place in town.

16:30.118 --> 16:32.822
Free this, free that, and free everything.

16:32.842 --> 16:35.707
And one of my passes was to the Top of the Mark.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.990
That's Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco.

16:38.391 --> 16:39.272
Pretty ritzy place.

16:39.292 --> 16:40.715
Oh, yeah, real ritzy.

16:40.735 --> 16:45.823
And I go up there, and who is playing the piano?

16:45.883 --> 16:47.365
Who was the entertainer that night?

16:47.385 --> 16:48.687
But Earl Garner on the piano.

16:49.257 --> 16:54.423
And middle of the afternoon or evening, he said, folks, I have something I like to announce.

16:54.843 --> 16:56.765
I've never written the words of this song, Misty.

16:57.246 --> 17:01.591
And Johnny Mathis one time asked me if you ever write words that I like to sing it.

17:01.931 --> 17:05.615
So, folks, tonight for the first time, Johnny Mathis is going to sing Misty.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.096
Wow.

17:06.116 --> 17:07.758
And he played Misty.

17:07.938 --> 17:09.059
And you happened to be there.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.140
I happened to be there.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.902
So the Lord was with me a second time.

17:12.043 --> 17:13.324
So who knows?

17:13.456 --> 17:25.592
There I was back home safe and I got out of the Marine Corps off of active duty and about

17:25.859 --> 17:28.383
Nine months later, the Army wanted to draft me in Little Rock.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.325
That's where I was from.

17:29.806 --> 17:40.724
And they said the reason they wanted to draft me was that their pool of eligible draft-age men had been diminished by one of the reasons was all the Marines they called on active duty in 1950.

17:41.325 --> 17:43.048
And I said, you're not going to do that to me.

17:43.068 --> 17:45.813
So I went to the Marine Corps, and I said, look, I want to come back in the Marine Corps.

17:45.833 --> 17:46.534
They're going to draft me.

17:46.594 --> 17:47.255
And they said, OK.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.778
So they made me a sergeant.

17:48.758 --> 17:50.521
May as well go back where you came from.

17:50.581 --> 17:53.186
So I ended up being at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

17:53.206 --> 18:09.774
I ended up being a comm chief there and I went on recruiting duty and I recruited marine officers in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois at the universities for the Marines officer program, reserve officer program, and I had a great life.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.998
And today, you know,

18:12.417 --> 18:17.308
I've been a Marine, and I'll always be a Marine, and I love the Corps.

18:17.849 --> 18:18.851
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

18:19.112 --> 18:19.673
Absolutely.

18:19.693 --> 18:25.686
We've got some pictures that you were polite enough to let us borrow and scan in for us.

18:25.706 --> 18:28.452
Let's take a look at them here, and if you can tell us what each of these are.

18:28.837 --> 18:31.822
That's a picture when I was on recruiting duty in Indianapolis.

18:31.882 --> 18:32.564
And which one are you?

18:33.285 --> 18:35.889
I'm the one to the right of the girl.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.714
If you're looking at the picture, just to the left of the girl.

18:39.275 --> 18:42.461
And I'm the tallest one there.

18:42.922 --> 18:43.763
With that big smile.

18:43.803 --> 18:46.027
Yeah, I was happy as a pig in mud.

18:46.047 --> 18:48.111
We had elected this girl Miss Battle Cry.

18:48.091 --> 18:53.221
The movie Battle Cry came out when I was on recruiting duty, and we said, well, we'll get a little publicity in town.

18:53.241 --> 18:59.654
And so we went together and had a Miss Battle Cry contest citywide, and this young lady won it.

18:59.674 --> 19:02.239
Those are just some fellows that were on recruiting duty with me.

19:02.420 --> 19:03.321
Okay.

19:03.341 --> 19:03.802
There you go.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.189
Now, that is the quintessential Marine, right?

19:07.991 --> 19:09.694
That picture was taken.

19:10.265 --> 19:18.219
At Parris Island, when I was in recruiter school, they released that for publication to your hometowns with articles or something like that.

19:18.239 --> 19:19.902
I don't think they ever released it in my hometown.

19:19.922 --> 19:21.846
I don't think anybody ever saw that before but me.

19:22.908 --> 19:24.290
But that was in 1951.

19:24.510 --> 19:27.576
Okay, where are we at here?

19:27.836 --> 19:28.938
No, that was in 1952.

19:28.978 --> 19:32.745
That's around...

19:35.948 --> 19:39.383
That's just north of Pohang in Korea.

19:39.403 --> 19:46.212
That was taken probably in February, I guess, of 1951.

19:46.715 --> 19:51.743
The guy in the middle is Freddie Lee Sturdivant, a good friend of mine from Kyle, Texas.

19:51.763 --> 19:59.015
And you have a good story about him, I believe, where Freddie was wounded in quite a different place.

19:59.035 --> 19:59.256
Yeah.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.341
Freddie is on my wire team, and we worked as pairs.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.623
We each run shotguns.

20:03.643 --> 20:06.748
Explain what a wire team is.

20:06.728 --> 20:20.396
usually made up of two guys that end up working together to lay telephone lines, generally on the ground in combat, from a higher echelon down to a lower echelon.

20:20.977 --> 20:25.767
And in our case, we were at a regiment, so we were laying telephone communications

20:25.747 --> 20:34.901
to the battalions below us and to other units that were lateral to us, to the right or to the left, who were not necessarily Marines.

20:34.941 --> 20:37.465
It could be whatever unit was to your immediate right and left.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.468
It was your job to get them to get communications to them.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.613
Our job was to see they always had telephone communications and it worked.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.596
If it didn't work, you had to go troubleshoot them.

20:45.057 --> 20:47.380
And that's what Fred and I were doing one day.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.864
Fred and I had laid a lateral telephone line

20:50.873 --> 21:01.449
from one of our battalion companies on a hill down a hillside about 600 meters and up about 700 meters to an army unit on the next hill.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.852
Those are long runs.

21:03.953 --> 21:05.034
Oh, yeah.

21:05.054 --> 21:12.325
And down below this, at the bottom of this hill and between these two hills was a fast-running creek river that had a swinging bridge over it.

21:13.216 --> 21:21.044
So as we were moving down that hill, we would do about 100 or 150 yards at a time, and I would be the guy out, and he would be shotgunning for me.

21:21.064 --> 21:24.428
Then he would move out and check the next 150 yards, and I'd shotgun for him.

21:24.929 --> 21:29.774
Well, we get down to the bottom of the hill, and Fred's turned us to shotgun down over this bridge.

21:29.794 --> 21:36.181
And he's standing down over this bridge, pulling up a looped wire that we had looped down so if anybody walking on the bridge wouldn't tear it.

21:36.861 --> 21:43.088
And as he was bending over, I heard this shot, and Freddy fell off the bridge.

21:44.755 --> 21:46.177
So you were about 100, 150 yards behind him.

21:46.477 --> 21:49.862
I was up on the side of the hill, probably 100 yards from him.

21:50.002 --> 21:54.328
About 100 yards, probably.

21:54.349 --> 21:56.051
And Freddie disappeared.

21:56.111 --> 22:02.480
And as I see this, we had trained ourselves to take care of the environment and be aware of what's happening around us.

22:02.780 --> 22:08.348
And I saw this puff of smoke come out of this tree about 50 yards up the other side of this hill.

22:09.169 --> 22:14.577
And so I just emptied a 30-round clip from a carbine, just emptied it.

22:15.603 --> 22:17.526
No more fire coming from that side of the hill.

22:17.566 --> 22:21.493
And then I called him and I said, hey, Fred, hey, Fred, where are you, stud?

22:21.513 --> 22:27.784
And way down side, like from way off in the distance, he said, hey, Shook, they got me in the butt.

22:29.146 --> 22:31.170
So I go down to get him, pull him out.

22:31.290 --> 22:32.532
He got grazed.

22:32.798 --> 22:36.923
We put a bandage on him, took him back, they put another bandage on him.

22:36.943 --> 22:37.865
He never went to see a doctor.

22:37.885 --> 22:41.389
The getting shot in the posterior is not that big of a deal for a Marine.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.432
Well, it did get you out.

22:43.512 --> 22:49.380
He wasn't about to go back to the sick bay or to the MASH hospital, because if you went to a MASH hospital, it was terrible.

22:49.760 --> 22:57.751
I mean, you had to pick up cigarette butts where people made messes, and you know, you don't do that afield, and we didn't want to have to go through that, so we did everything we could do.

22:57.771 --> 22:58.772
It's better to stay up front.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.554
Yeah, better to be where we were.

23:00.594 --> 23:01.115
That's true.

23:01.756 --> 23:07.944
But that's one of those stories that happens to us whenever we keep our sanity.

23:08.305 --> 23:09.667
Let's get back at the pictures here.

23:09.687 --> 23:11.048
We've got about four minutes left.

23:11.089 --> 23:15.394
Now explain this picture because I'm sure everybody's wondering what in the world this is.

23:15.414 --> 23:16.576
Well, I'll tell you what that is.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.518
And you're the gentleman in the back.

23:18.538 --> 23:19.780
I'm the little guy.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.063
The big fat-faced fella is Al Reddig.

23:22.704 --> 23:24.186
And Al was a...

23:24.284 --> 23:25.590
from Oklahoma City.

23:25.611 --> 23:28.203
He was a big Indian.

23:28.987 --> 23:31.982
I think that picture was taken in San Diego

23:33.970 --> 23:36.374
We left the bar at the U.S.

23:36.394 --> 23:44.407
Grant Hotel in San Diego, headed probably for another bar, and there was one of those photographic things.

23:44.427 --> 23:46.170
One of those photographic booths.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.072
And I think we got in.

23:47.112 --> 23:48.234
I think that's where that was taken.

23:48.915 --> 23:51.379
It was taken in the summer of 1950.

23:51.639 --> 23:59.252
That picture was taken at Camp Pendleton whenever we were organizing to go aboard ship to head for Korea.

23:59.232 --> 24:04.017
So this is after they had called you back and you were just probably just a few days or so from boarding ship?

24:04.037 --> 24:06.259
Yeah, it was probably the first two or three days that we were.

24:06.299 --> 24:09.543
We lived in Quonset Huts in the old place called Tent Camp II.

24:09.603 --> 24:11.325
That's what we called it then.

24:11.345 --> 24:15.089
And that one was taken at the same time.

24:15.109 --> 24:16.570
Yeah, that one was taken at the same time.

24:19.433 --> 24:20.154
Okay.

24:20.174 --> 24:27.341
That picture was taken aboard ship on the way to Korea at a Navy galley.

24:27.381 --> 24:29.003
They call them galley's mess hall.

24:29.438 --> 24:39.671
and that table is a long, narrow, metal top table with sides, with lips on the side.

24:39.731 --> 24:48.282
You can see they're about two inches high, and we put our trays on there, and one guy's down on one side, and one guy's down on the other side of the table, and maybe 20 guys on each side.

24:48.302 --> 24:52.187
This long table that keeps the trays from falling off when the ship's in rough water.

24:52.687 --> 24:53.829
Okay.

24:53.849 --> 24:54.409
What's this picture?

24:54.710 --> 24:58.855
That's a picture that was taken in Mason, I think,

25:00.893 --> 25:08.446
I think it was taken in Maesong, Korea in the spring and right after we, just before we went back online in January or February of 1951.

25:08.827 --> 25:10.710
Okie doke.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.578
That's a picture on the bow of a ship headed

25:16.503 --> 25:25.033
You know, I said before, I think that was headed for Korea aboard the APA that we left San Diego on.

25:25.714 --> 25:29.238
And I can tell it because I was smoking there, and I still smoke.

25:29.258 --> 25:30.279
I've got that bad habit.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.105
But I was one of the few guys that could light a cigarette on the bow of that ship with the wind blowing like it would.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.369
This has got to be one of the neatest pictures I think I've seen.

25:39.170 --> 25:42.173
That's an artist's rendition.

25:43.098 --> 25:47.284
that was shot from a positive is a negative of a positive.

25:47.304 --> 25:51.350
And, uh, it, uh, I, I thought it would be neat to do that.

25:51.390 --> 25:57.860
I was in the printing business and we, uh, we did that and use that for some publication that we were doing for the Marines.

25:58.561 --> 26:07.654
And, uh, I just thought it was a, a nice rendition kind of shows the white from the, that is a rendition of, of the Marines coming out of the, uh,

26:08.478 --> 26:09.480
out of the reservoir.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.643
It was taken whenever the snow was on the ground.

26:11.783 --> 26:13.566
Hugh, we've got just one minute left.

26:13.646 --> 26:15.128
I would like to thank you for being here today.

26:15.188 --> 26:16.110
Wish we had more time.

26:16.410 --> 26:21.178
We'll get you to come back and tell us some more of your stories about the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.

26:21.778 --> 26:22.399
Thank you for being here.

26:22.439 --> 26:22.920
Well, thank you, Kyle.

26:22.940 --> 26:23.942
Appreciate your time.

26:24.302 --> 26:25.003
Glad to be here.

26:25.384 --> 26:25.825
Absolutely.

26:25.845 --> 26:26.926
It's all my time.

26:26.946 --> 26:27.988
Absolutely.

26:27.968 --> 26:30.971
Hugh Shockey was born in the mountains of western Kentucky.

26:30.991 --> 26:47.270
He grew up in Arkansas, and by the time he was 18, he was a combat-hardened Marine, making a landing at Incheon, Korea, and taking part in one of the most storied battles of the Korean conflict, the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which pitted approximately 30,000 U.S.

26:47.730 --> 26:52.035
troops against a Chinese contingent of over 200,000.

26:52.015 --> 26:52.495
The U.S.

26:52.535 --> 26:58.060
Marines consider the Battle of Chosin Reservoir to be one of the proudest parts of their own history.

26:58.661 --> 27:05.547
The Marines mauled the Chinese divisions they faced so badly that the Chinese had to be withdrawn from the front.

27:05.567 --> 27:10.452
The Marines then marched out and in an orderly fashion and intact.

27:10.472 --> 27:14.015
This is the indomitable spirit that is the United States Marine Corps.

27:14.796 --> 27:16.637
Shake a service member's hand when you see them.

27:17.038 --> 27:22.022
Thank them for the commitment they have made, no matter what branch of the service they have chosen.

27:22.002 --> 27:27.611
For Hugh Shockey, Tom Turbiville, and the entire KMU-TV crew, I'm Kyle Netterville.

27:28.112 --> 27:45.259
Thank you for watching Veterans of the Valley.

28:11.783 --> 28:22.144
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

28:22.625 --> 28:32.965
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.
