00:25.009 --> 00:35.009
[Music.]

00:35.009 --> 00:45.009
[Music.]

00:45.009 --> 00:49.101
Welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:49.121 --> 00:50.162
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:51.063 --> 00:57.852
Four months may not seem like a long time to most of us, but for Bob Bruner of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, U.S.

00:57.973 --> 00:58.253
Army,

00:58.570 --> 01:04.196
The four months starting on New Year's Day of 1991 was a period in time he'll never forget.

01:04.216 --> 01:12.504
Bob Bruner drove a Humvee in Operation Desert Storm's ground war, and he saw the war up close from start, indeed, to finish.

01:12.524 --> 01:17.329
It was his unit that took the airfield at Safwan, Iraq, where the ceasefire was negotiated.

01:17.709 --> 01:22.754
It's a remarkable story of service, and we welcome Sergeant Bob Bruner to Veterans of the Valley.

01:22.774 --> 01:25.337
Bob, it is indeed a pleasure to have you here.

01:25.638 --> 01:29.322
I want to get you right to the Gulf War, New Year's Day, 1991.

01:29.903 --> 01:38.013
You actually celebrated the New Year when midnight you were flying to Saudi Arabia from Brussels, and I think you said the plane was over Ireland at the time, right?

01:38.033 --> 01:53.451
Yeah, the pilot of the plane we flew over on, and there were a lot of civilian pilots that flew over to volunteer force, told us that if we looked over the right wing, we'd see the lights of Ireland, and if there was any place in the world we'd rather be, that would be a good place to be right now, and we'd have to agree with that.

01:53.650 --> 02:00.658
Indeed, but you landed at King Fahd Field in Saudi Arabia, and the first thing that you remember, you got out.

02:00.898 --> 02:02.179
You'd come from a cold area.

02:02.199 --> 02:04.682
It was mighty hot in Saudi Arabia, as one can imagine.

02:04.762 --> 02:08.667
Yeah, we flew out of Forest Hill, Topeka, Kansas, and there was a blizzard going on.

02:08.687 --> 02:23.623
And when we landed in King Fahd Field in Saudi Arabia, just outside of Daharan, it was probably 80, 90 degrees, and we had full winter clothing on at that time and looking for a place to get out of it.

02:23.603 --> 02:27.169
You bused to a place called Cobar Tower, which you call the MGM Grand.

02:27.189 --> 02:32.838
It was kind of a high-rise condo complex with no furniture, but it was a place to sleep and sort of get over the jet lag.

02:33.419 --> 02:40.470
Talk about what happened after that, after you left Cobar Towers and sort of take us from there into the start of the war.

02:40.891 --> 02:48.784
We left Cobar Towers after our vehicles all arrived and took a very long convoy up to

02:48.882 --> 02:49.983
northern Saudi Arabia.

02:50.163 --> 02:51.745
It was a very, very long convoy.

02:51.785 --> 02:55.148
It took all day and right up through the early evening.

02:56.049 --> 02:56.870
About 13 hours, I think.

02:56.890 --> 02:58.051
About 13 hours, yes.

02:58.832 --> 03:03.397
We pulled and kind of circled our vehicles, kind of like the old cavalry used to circle the wagons.

03:03.457 --> 03:07.041
We kind of circled the vehicles around, caught some shut-eye.

03:07.561 --> 03:10.524
We set up the forward area for the cavalry.

03:10.544 --> 03:16.290
1st, 1st and 4th Cavalry was called TAA Roosevelt, which is a tactical assembly area.

03:16.270 --> 03:23.188
And that's where we started getting all of our equipment and our cells ready in case what did happen pursued.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.113
And, of course, the war started.

03:25.695 --> 03:27.439
Now, you talked about the vehicles that showed up.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.284
Let's go back.

03:29.855 --> 03:36.964
to the states, these are vehicles that you had actually had a part in preparing to come over as far as painting, camouflage, things like that, right?

03:36.984 --> 03:42.552
All of our vehicles were painted in a woodland camouflage, the green and the black and the tan.

03:43.313 --> 03:45.856
And of course that was set up for European theater.

03:46.357 --> 03:52.825
And we went from, and one weekend drove the whole squadron down to a paint shop, kind of like a

03:53.058 --> 03:57.746
I told you like an Earl Shies paint shop and you had to put grease and tape on the windows where they painted over it.

03:57.866 --> 04:09.505
We had our desert camo painted on our vehicles and then they rail headed from Fort Riley, Kansas down to Port Arthur, Texas where they were put on transports and shipped overseas.

04:09.525 --> 04:12.269
Give us an idea of Saudi Arabia and sort of what it was like.

04:13.391 --> 04:17.057
Lots of sand to deal with as one would imagine.

04:17.324 --> 04:22.357
Lots of sand and it was the flattest place I've ever seen in my life, even worse than Kansas.

04:22.377 --> 04:33.966
And the sand there was really powdered, almost like a Nestle Quick type of powder, very, very fine powdered sand with about a foot underneath that solid rock.

04:34.233 --> 04:38.059
and very hard to dig foxholes and finding positions and things like that.

04:38.420 --> 04:39.661
Right, right.

04:39.682 --> 04:43.728
And you had to protect yourself from the sand, so you needed sort of unique equipment for that, right?

04:43.748 --> 05:01.776
Yeah, we got there and realized the sand was so fine, we had no notice, and usually when you have people over there, you'll hear how things are, but we got over there and we found out, well, our weapons were getting very, very dirty very quick, but it's very fine powdered sand, so we requested pantyhose and

05:02.161 --> 05:14.955
plastic bags and items that were going to protect our weapons, especially the pantyhose were just, they worked amazing in keeping the dust and the sand off the bolts and the magazine covers and so on and so forth.

05:15.035 --> 05:18.759
Right, not just weapons but any type of electronics and anything it would protect.

05:18.859 --> 05:23.604
I had a, you know, all the plastic bags were really good for the tape recorders.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.788
Tape recorders were pretty popular over there because we'd set tapes back to our families.

05:27.108 --> 05:28.810
Right, right.

05:30.494 --> 05:39.466
Take us on a little bit closer to when the air war started, which a lot of people can recall that date, sort of where they were in January 15th in 1991.

05:40.026 --> 05:42.049
But before that, you talked to me about a berm.

05:42.590 --> 05:45.113
And in a flat land, a berm obviously stands out.

05:45.133 --> 05:49.839
Yeah, very, very, like I said, very, very flat terrain there.

05:49.859 --> 05:52.322
And it was getting closer to the deadline.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.385
And so we moved further north.

05:54.445 --> 06:00.433
We moved up to the neutral zone, which Iraq, when they went into Kuwait, the neutral zone is the diamond triangle-shaped

06:01.004 --> 06:05.431
part of the country that's in between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq.

06:06.433 --> 06:12.463
And the Iraqi army had went ahead and occupied the neutral zone.

06:13.164 --> 06:25.003
And the engineers had one up to keep them from coming any further, put up a humongous wall, 12 to 15 foot tall wall of dirt and sand and rock and probably about 12

06:25.253 --> 06:27.475
12 to 15 foot wide, deep I would say.

06:27.835 --> 06:32.540
And we were there for the first start of it.

06:32.620 --> 06:46.732
And of course, then when Jim Baker went over to Geneva to talk to the Iraqi delegation about possibly having a ceasefire, not even having a ceasefire, but peace talks before the war started, we pulled back for a few days.

06:46.812 --> 06:54.079
And of course, when the Iraqi delegation said they weren't going to accept the peace talks, we moved up north again.

06:54.447 --> 07:02.184
A lot of the time, though, when you were there, just sort of in a waiting mode, you weren't just sitting around playing football and playing volleyball.

07:02.404 --> 07:04.749
Y'all were training.

07:04.810 --> 07:10.582
There was a lot of training to be done to get ready for what might happen as far as enemy recognition, things like that.

07:10.622 --> 07:13.789
Talk about the constant training you were doing to prepare.

07:14.292 --> 07:24.183
Well, from the time we landed at the Khobar Towers until the air war started, until the ground war started, training was taken very seriously.

07:24.203 --> 07:31.931
From what young soldiers are like young kids today, they don't take a lot of things seriously until things happen, until you go to the gas chamber or something like that and experience that.

07:32.712 --> 07:36.476
But actually, the younger soldiers were demanding more training.

07:36.636 --> 07:40.100
They wanted to feel more secure and have an understanding.

07:40.140 --> 07:43.303
We had a lot of new equipment that was issued to us that we had never had before.

07:43.604 --> 07:49.071
The Magellan GPS is what we drive around today with the tom-toms and so on and so forth.

07:49.712 --> 07:53.838
We experienced that for the first time when we were there.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.821
It was called the Magellan GPS.

07:55.901 --> 08:01.488
We were unfamiliar with it and didn't do a lot of good in the middle of the desert other than giving you one grid point to the next.

08:02.870 --> 08:06.996
But NBC training, weapons qualifications still continued.

08:06.976 --> 08:24.145
constant up check up check of equipment our M1 Abrams tanks went through retro armor outfit while we were there within a two or three week period so it was a constant training and constantly upgrading our equipment.

08:24.165 --> 08:31.498
It's hard to believe it's been 17 years since that era January 15th 1991 nearly 18 years now but I would imagine that anybody

08:32.002 --> 08:41.310
in their upper 20s or at least 30 years old, probably can remember where they were, at least on the state side, watching television that night.

08:41.330 --> 08:51.720
I know I personally was up all night long watching, I guess CNN was the main network of choice there as far as 24-hour coverage of it.

08:51.740 --> 08:58.546
But that night, talk about the perspective that you had the night that the air war started in Desert Storm.

08:58.566 --> 09:01.148
Well, the night the air war started in Desert Storm, we were...

09:02.039 --> 09:07.011
We were in a camp, and we knew something was going to happen.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.176
We didn't know exactly when.

09:09.296 --> 09:14.749
We knew the deadline was coming up, and at 12 o'clock that time, I'm not sure what time it was back

09:15.168 --> 09:17.690
in the United States was later, earlier today.

09:18.331 --> 09:21.614
But we had aircraft go over.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.276
We had the call to go to all our fighting positions.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.738
So we all went out to our foxholes.

09:25.778 --> 09:33.865
And as we're running out there, the F-16s and the F-15s were flying right dead over camps at a combat flight level.

09:33.885 --> 09:41.092
I remember so that we had a soldier of mine who had a 60, the M-60 machine gun, was taking the M-60 machine gun out to the fighting position.

09:41.132 --> 09:43.234
He didn't have his chin strap on and it blew his helmet off.

09:43.214 --> 09:46.680
the suction from the jets flying over.

09:46.700 --> 09:54.772
And so everybody kind of chinned up their straps and got in the fighting positions because you're like two or three feet deeper than you were standing on top of the ground being there.

09:54.792 --> 09:57.236
So very, very interesting.

09:57.797 --> 10:03.646
We heard the bombers fly over and at night we'd sit there while we were in our fighting positions.

10:03.666 --> 10:04.648
You could feel the ground

10:05.354 --> 10:10.421
You feel the concussion from the bombs that were dropping on some of the airfields just on the other side of the border.

10:11.482 --> 10:13.825
Like I said, we were still quite a ways from Baghdad at that time.

10:13.845 --> 10:14.747
I doubt it was Baghdad.

10:14.767 --> 10:25.641
We were amazed on the pictures we saw that come through the Stars and Stripes newspaper that we got that still came to us periodically during the war, the pictures of Baghdad and all the

10:25.942 --> 10:29.066
all the anti-air fire and so and so forth that was happening there.

10:29.446 --> 10:34.412
And the videos I saw of it when I got back, I was still rather impressed that we didn't lose more than we did.

10:34.692 --> 10:35.013
Right.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.155
But it was a very, very successful campaign.

10:37.175 --> 10:41.320
If we wouldn't have had a successful campaign in the air, we would not have had a successful ground campaign.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.722
Right.

10:42.802 --> 10:47.988
You talked about the, well, that's moving on as we get closer to the ground war.

10:48.068 --> 10:48.949
Let's go ahead and go there.

10:48.969 --> 10:50.751
February 21st, 1991.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.768
That was the day that the ground war started.

10:52.808 --> 10:56.713
Talk about what your role was as a Humvee driver.

10:56.734 --> 11:02.783
Well, I was the NBC, which is nuclear, biological, and chemical squadron NBC NCO.

11:03.524 --> 11:07.610
And my secondary duty over there was the driver's training NCO.

11:07.630 --> 11:12.597
And I drove the squadron maintenance officer, and I drove the squadron NBC officer.

11:13.118 --> 11:16.283
And then I also drove for a few other staff positional officers.

11:16.263 --> 11:22.649
officers that were there, some lieutenants and so on and so forth that worked for the squadron commander, took in the meetings and so on and so forth.

11:23.490 --> 11:35.883
The main job as MBCD camp was to make sure all the monitors and alarms were set up and prepared in case something did go off that we would do what we had to do by running our test.

11:37.725 --> 11:46.033
You know, the night the grand war started, we talked about this yesterday, we were sitting up at the berm and that night we knew that we were going to have a

11:46.418 --> 11:54.110
situation where the commander and the squadron sergeant major said, you all need to, everybody get sleep tonight, you and all your soldiers.

11:54.150 --> 11:59.718
We had MPs in that were the perimeter because not even a quarter of a mile away from us was this berm.

11:59.738 --> 12:03.424
On the other side of this berm was Iraqi soldiers in fighting positions.

12:04.285 --> 12:09.133
And then the artillery and the MLRS units moved up in the middle of the night.

12:09.153 --> 12:11.937
About 2 o'clock in the morning, they started letting loose.

12:12.305 --> 12:14.308
Tell them what MLRS is.

12:14.408 --> 12:15.469
Multi-launch rocket systems.

12:15.489 --> 12:17.211
Multi-launch rocket systems.

12:17.652 --> 12:19.615
Something that I had never experienced that before.

12:19.655 --> 12:26.263
I've experienced the 105 howitzers and things like that by doing training with them at the National Training Center in California.

12:26.283 --> 12:31.030
But it was my first experience with MLRS and it was the prettiest fireworks show you'll ever see.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.632
Indeed.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.334
And it kept you up at night too, right?

12:34.354 --> 12:34.574
Yeah.

12:35.395 --> 12:36.156
Pretty hard to sleep.

12:36.176 --> 12:38.720
We probably would sit up most of the night talking before things happened.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.422
A lot of the non-commissioned officers did and

12:40.857 --> 12:49.026
And that night, we probably just started buzzing out, and it was probably about 2 o'clock when all that stuff started taking off, and of course you couldn't sleep through that.

12:49.607 --> 12:58.377
When we visited, you talked about the helicopter, the Apache, the Blackhawks, the Cobras, and they really saved your bacon on more than one occasion.

12:58.678 --> 13:03.143
The job that these aircraft did was just incredible.

13:03.163 --> 13:07.708
Yeah, being in the cavalry, we had our primary vehicles were

13:08.212 --> 13:11.036
the M1 Abrams, M3 Bradley vehicle.

13:11.837 --> 13:17.365
Of course, we had multiple M577s, which were tactical meeting vehicles.

13:17.385 --> 13:26.938
But our biggest savior there during this kind of conflict was the Apaches, the Cobras, and the Blackhawks.

13:27.199 --> 13:34.088
And of course, there were still some Hueys and OH-58 Deltas, which is a KOA warrior that the scouts use.

13:34.509 --> 13:37.493
Yeah, the Apaches and the Cobras were very,

13:38.215 --> 13:40.558
Very much saved our bacon.

13:40.578 --> 13:42.400
And very impressive to watch, is that right?

13:42.500 --> 13:43.461
Very impressive to watch.

13:43.501 --> 13:51.089
You know, we've seen the Abram tanks and so on and so forth go through, and we knew what they were capable of doing.

13:51.109 --> 13:56.896
A lot of us didn't get to have live fire exercises with our air crews, and that was amazing to watch.

13:57.617 --> 14:02.662
You were obviously impressed about the organization of the United States, the Allied Forces.

14:03.163 --> 14:04.965
The enemy was pretty impressed also, weren't they?

14:05.215 --> 14:10.767
Yeah, I think the coalition forces that we have were very overwhelming to them.

14:12.069 --> 14:15.096
We knew that the Iraqi army was going to be a tough army.

14:16.078 --> 14:17.861
We just weren't sure how tough.

14:17.882 --> 14:21.469
They had just come out of an eight to ten year war with Iran.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.717
So they were very combat veteran trained.

14:23.837 --> 14:27.003
And we hadn't had a lot of experience since Grenada.

14:27.023 --> 14:31.051
And that was usually, most of that was special forces, special ops that took care of that.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.796
So we were really an untested army at that time.

14:34.557 --> 14:36.741
And with that, training really proved to really help.

14:37.193 --> 14:44.701
Let's go to some photographs right now, and then we'll come back and we'll visit some more of some of the pictures that Bob Brunner has supplied to us.

14:44.901 --> 14:45.842
We talked about the berm.

14:45.862 --> 14:47.103
This is the berm, right?

14:47.364 --> 14:55.872
Yeah, that's about that 15-foot tall berm, and he's probably about three or four foot up, standing up, taking a picture of me up.

14:55.892 --> 15:04.281
And at the time we had this picture, we didn't realize that there was enemy Iraqi soldiers, probably another 25 foot on the other side there,

15:04.987 --> 15:12.386
in firing positions because, I mean, it went about another 10 or 15, about another 10 foot behind me there that you could walk on.

15:12.406 --> 15:15.334
And of course we saw the fighting positions when the ground war started.

15:15.449 --> 15:16.850
You're smiling for the photo.

15:16.870 --> 15:19.153
I'm smiling for the photo, and yeah.

15:19.533 --> 15:23.517
Yeah, Sergeant Major kind of got on us after this picture here and said, what are you idiots doing?

15:23.597 --> 15:25.299
Yeah, because the enemy's watching you too.

15:25.819 --> 15:27.561
Okay, let's move on to the next photograph.

15:29.042 --> 15:37.230
This is myself, one of our maintenance NCOs, and another one of the scouts for the cab.

15:37.731 --> 15:39.612
And we're at one of our setup areas here.

15:40.093 --> 15:42.996
Those are the Bradleys on a perimeter back behind us.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.477
Of course, there's camouflage.

15:44.457 --> 15:47.060
Not that green camouflage did a lot of good out in the middle of the desert.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.044
But we were coming back or going to a meeting at this time.

15:52.665 --> 15:52.946
Okay.

15:53.767 --> 15:54.928
Next one.

15:55.228 --> 16:01.975
Me and a buddy of mine, another Sergeant Dave Woodman, and this is his deuce and a half truck he had with supplies in the back of it.

16:01.995 --> 16:07.040
This is on the way going back home because he noticed we don't have any flak vests or no weapons or anything on us.

16:07.100 --> 16:11.865
This is probably right at the border of Iraq and Saudi Arabia going back home and

16:12.284 --> 16:16.634
getting ready to come down from everything.

16:16.794 --> 16:17.095
Okay.

16:19.119 --> 16:22.466
These were some of the first PLWs captured during Desert Storm.

16:23.909 --> 16:27.357
These gentlemen were noticed come walking up into a perimeter

16:27.843 --> 16:31.487
We went to our fighting positions because we didn't know how many people there were going to be.

16:32.088 --> 16:34.250
I think there was like four POWs here.

16:34.471 --> 16:43.942
And at this picture right here is our medical officer and medical personnel checking out the POWs because we treated our POWs very well.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.744
Yes, okay.

16:45.764 --> 16:57.057
Speaking of POWs, there's... This is actually at one of our checkpoints we had up in Iraq, not too far from Ur, in between Al Nazariah and Basra.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.238
probably about 50 to 75 miles away from Baghdad.

17:01.060 --> 17:08.096
We had a lot of civilians walking out in the middle of the desert and we had to investigate what the deal was and kind of find out they had military credentials.

17:08.116 --> 17:12.306
They were trying to get out of their uniforms so they wouldn't be combatives.

17:12.326 --> 17:12.767
So...

17:13.253 --> 17:15.436
And at that time, we were still taking POWs.

17:15.476 --> 17:16.177
We brought them in.

17:16.197 --> 17:20.604
Of course, once they saw us, we were all best buddies, and they just loved President Bush.

17:20.845 --> 17:21.345
Oh, absolutely.

17:21.365 --> 17:23.148
I think we got another picture of them smiling.

17:23.949 --> 17:24.690
Oh, yeah.

17:24.730 --> 17:25.291
Peace sign.

17:25.592 --> 17:28.276
This right here, they're saying we love Bush.

17:28.296 --> 17:34.245
So they were very happy that they were captured by us and not by Sodom.

17:34.545 --> 17:34.986
Exactly.

17:35.327 --> 17:35.787
Exactly.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.271
Okay.

17:38.531 --> 17:38.772
Promotion.

17:39.032 --> 17:39.433
Promotion.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.115
This is the day I got promoted to Staff Sergeant.

17:41.456 --> 17:41.556
Okay.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.162
Wanted to include that one.

17:44.182 --> 17:48.547
You had mentioned Ur, which is a place of biblical history.

17:49.307 --> 17:50.529
And talk a little bit about it.

17:51.209 --> 17:55.774
This is up by the Euphrates River in Iraq.

17:55.794 --> 17:59.398
And didn't realize how biblical that part of Iraq was.

17:59.458 --> 18:02.622
And our chaplain told us there's a, the Zur God of Ur is there.

18:02.982 --> 18:08.488
And so we all went and it's in the book of Genesis of Ur as in Ur.

18:08.806 --> 18:11.870
We went there and it was just an amazing place.

18:11.890 --> 18:15.696
And just outside of that is what they call Abraham City.

18:15.716 --> 18:17.258
Let's go to the next picture as a matter of fact.

18:17.418 --> 18:21.184
And that's me standing with the guide we had.

18:21.204 --> 18:25.630
It was an Iraqi guide that knows this whole area and has worked with all the archaeologists.

18:25.670 --> 18:32.640
This is an area right here where they found a scroll that dealt with Abraham and what they pretty much think is Abraham's house.

18:35.284 --> 18:36.906
Wow, very impressive.

18:37.021 --> 18:39.085
We're going to talk about this a little bit later.

18:39.145 --> 18:40.548
We referred to it in the opening.

18:40.588 --> 18:45.277
This was at the Saffron Airfield where the ceasefire was negotiated.

18:45.297 --> 18:49.364
This is from a book called The Road to Saffron, this photograph.

18:49.565 --> 18:52.831
You're not in this picture, but I just thought this was an impressive photograph.

18:52.971 --> 18:54.614
No, those are all my quarter horse buddies.

18:54.955 --> 18:58.101
That's Sea Troop 1st Squadron 4th Cavalry.

18:58.081 --> 19:01.850
We had a press day after SAF 1, and we'll get into that in a minute, I think.

19:03.253 --> 19:08.926
Basically, the whole airfield was set up with nothing but 1st Squadron 4th Cavalry vehicles.

19:08.946 --> 19:11.312
And this is Charlie Troop, and this is them.

19:12.034 --> 19:15.562
They're in front of one of their Cobras.

19:15.582 --> 19:15.702
Right.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.282
Your operation changed.

19:19.302 --> 19:20.886
You got orders to go to Kuwait.

19:20.946 --> 19:29.890
Talk about that, and it was sort of during this time that you really got to see the ugly underbelly of war and the horror of war also.

19:29.971 --> 19:31.615
Talk about these change of orders.

19:31.696 --> 19:38.745
Yeah, being in a cab unit, we were part of the 1st Infantry Division, which is a time-honored division.

19:38.765 --> 19:41.830
It's been involved in most every conflict there is.

19:42.310 --> 19:50.301
And being in one of the most decorated units in history, it was a real privilege and an honor to be with us.

19:50.321 --> 19:54.466
And we led the 1st Infantry Division and the 7th Corps into Iraq.

19:55.448 --> 19:57.170
Once we got into Iraq, the orders changed.

19:57.190 --> 19:58.632
They said, you guys are going to Kuwait.

19:59.050 --> 20:02.013
So we cut across no roads, all across country.

20:02.694 --> 20:05.096
And it was late at night.

20:05.356 --> 20:08.679
We just broke into the borders of Kuwait.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.582
We had some small arms fire and some tanks were going on.

20:11.622 --> 20:15.146
Like I said, the Apaches and the Cobras really took care of us with the night vision goggles.

20:16.387 --> 20:18.249
Took a little bit of artillery.

20:18.289 --> 20:21.412
Nothing too close to worry about.

20:21.692 --> 20:23.734
But we saw these lights in the horizon.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.856
And I'm like, man, maybe there's a truck stop down there.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.538
We can go get a hamburger or something, you know?

20:27.890 --> 20:29.332
and you just kind of forget where you're at.

20:30.053 --> 20:43.775
And kind of find out the more we drove, it was the oil fires that the Iraqi army had knocked all the heads off the wells and set up their oil on fire, the Kuwaiti oil on fire, because if they couldn't have it, they didn't want anybody else to have it.

20:44.817 --> 20:44.937
Right.

20:44.957 --> 20:53.070
We came across the four-way interstate, and it's called the Kuwait City Basra Highway, and there we...

20:53.776 --> 21:16.341
encountered from what the aircraft had taken care of all the Iraqi army that was told to leave had finally started leaving but they were bottlenecked up on the interstates and probably about a half mile deep and about five miles one way or the other from one end to the north and south on the highway on the interstate.

21:16.777 --> 21:17.979
there was nothing but vehicles.

21:18.019 --> 21:28.933
That night we had saw the Air Force and the Marine Corps pilots and the Navy pilots come in and they really did a lot of destruction on the highway.

21:29.254 --> 21:29.934
Right.

21:29.954 --> 21:40.308
And of course, you know, the Iraqi Army did their share of firing back at the aircraft and if they wouldn't have fired back at the aircraft and let us go in, it may not have proceeded to what it did, but they were still being combative, so.

21:40.629 --> 21:41.670
Indeed, indeed.

21:42.005 --> 21:51.558
Let's talk about Saquon, the orders to take the airfield in Saquon, and you found out that this was very important because this is where the ceasefire was going to be negotiated.

21:51.578 --> 22:01.331
We were about 50 miles in front of the 1st Infantry Division, and right when we got to the Basra, Kuwait City, there was a lot of death and destruction.

22:01.351 --> 22:04.755
And we spent some time there.

22:05.174 --> 22:12.909
Burying soldiers and giving proper burials and marking the graves because you can't have bodies around.

22:13.911 --> 22:14.512
We moved up.

22:14.532 --> 22:19.482
We got orders to take Saffron Airfield, which was at the border of Kuwait and Iraq.

22:20.384 --> 22:22.087
Very pinpointed, very small place.

22:22.147 --> 22:23.750
We wondered what was so important about it.

22:24.231 --> 22:27.638
But the whole 24th Republican Guard was protecting that airfield.

22:28.192 --> 22:31.096
So we moved up in the afternoon and got to the evening time.

22:31.777 --> 22:39.728
My squadron commander talked to the Iraqi general, a colonel that was on the other end of the radio, and our squadron commander just demanded he leave the airfield immediately.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.552
They didn't want to leave so friendly at first.

22:42.572 --> 22:46.157
There was some small-arm fire that went back and forth, a couple of Bradley shots.

22:47.239 --> 22:49.903
It was asked again, you know, you need to leave.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.785
They chose still not to leave.

22:52.106 --> 22:54.469
The squadron commander called in the Apaches and the

22:54.854 --> 23:04.885
and the Cobras, and they hovered over the airfield, over the Bradleys, and all of a sudden the Iraqi colonel, the general, whatever he was, gone on saying, okay, we're leaving.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.947
You know, you've got to give us 45 minutes.

23:07.127 --> 23:08.329
He says, no, you've got a half hour.

23:09.049 --> 23:12.493
So they started backing off and moving off the airfield.

23:12.994 --> 23:21.163
We captured Saffoen Airfield, kind of found out Saffoen Airfield was the prime point where the ceasefire was signed.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.186
Within a day or two, General Schwarzkopf flew in.

23:24.571 --> 23:34.891
talked to our unit, congratulated us on a job well done, and told us we had to get the airfield ready for, this is where the ceasefire talks were going to be held at.

23:34.911 --> 23:43.288
We moved a bunch of enemy equipment up surrounding the airfield, and when General Schwarzkopf came up again, he says,

23:43.268 --> 23:49.155
You know, I wanted to let the Iraqi Army know that we were serious, not embarrassing.

23:49.175 --> 23:52.038
So we had to move some of that equipment back off.

23:52.439 --> 24:00.308
The next day, General Schwarzkopf flew in with his bodyguards and his detail and four Blackhawks.

24:00.408 --> 24:07.197
And that same day, the Iraqi delegation drove up in a convoy surrounded by Bradleys, Apaches, and Cobras.

24:07.777 --> 24:10.120
It was an Iraqi general that came in and talked to

24:10.572 --> 24:18.609
General Schwarzkopf and of course at that time it was pretty much a high security deal and we just kind of pulled perimeter guard on the airfield.

24:18.629 --> 24:19.612
Right.

24:19.632 --> 24:26.065
But you can say that you were there when the end was planned, when the end was negotiated and agreed upon, right?

24:26.386 --> 24:26.567
Yeah.

24:26.587 --> 24:29.593
After everything was said and done, General Schwarzkopf pulled the whole unit by.

24:29.995 --> 24:34.019
and said, you boys did a really fine job and to reward you, what do you guys want?

24:34.039 --> 24:36.382
We said, we want some hamburgers or some steaks.

24:36.402 --> 24:41.167
So he sent up, I think, three reefer trailers full of meat.

24:41.187 --> 24:42.989
Right, and some beer, right?

24:43.049 --> 24:43.730
What kind?

24:43.750 --> 24:44.531
Schlitznere beer.

24:46.573 --> 24:48.676
But hey, it was wet, right?

24:48.696 --> 24:49.937
Yep, that was all it was.

24:51.258 --> 24:55.503
We've got a couple of minutes left, and I'm glad we do.

24:55.803 --> 24:57.766
Tell us about your granddad.

24:57.786 --> 24:59.007
Well, I've got a...

24:59.476 --> 25:04.662
A long history of a family that has served, and that's kind of what made me as patriotic as I am.

25:05.143 --> 25:08.787
But my biological grandfather was shot down in World War II.

25:09.047 --> 25:25.266
He was a navigator on a B-29, shot down over Japan, over the island of Kyushu, was taken to Kyushu University, where he was vivisection, which means dissected by the Japanese university there.

25:26.207 --> 25:26.327
Right.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.070
And there was a book written about that, as a matter of fact.

25:30.411 --> 25:30.671
Yeah.

25:30.691 --> 25:32.112
And you have that book.

25:32.132 --> 25:36.677
As a matter of fact, we've got a picture here of the cover of that book, and that's it right there.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.459
I'll leave that on the screen for a second.

25:38.499 --> 25:39.720
It's called The Fallen.

25:39.740 --> 25:43.845
As you can see, a true story of American POWs and Japanese wartime atrocities.

25:44.445 --> 25:48.450
And that was his unit, and that is your biological granddad, top row on the right.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.451
Top row on the right.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.493
Kind of looks like he's got his hand in his shirt there.

25:51.953 --> 25:52.073
Right.

25:52.093 --> 25:56.398
And that was taken at Guam, probably not too long before

25:56.902 --> 25:58.043
They were shot down.

25:58.443 --> 26:02.087
I mean, I'm not going to say how soon because I'm not really sure when that picture was taken.

26:02.568 --> 26:04.569
But I know they weren't on Guam very long.

26:04.589 --> 26:06.812
Right, right, right.

26:06.832 --> 26:14.459
And your grandmother, of course, after this happened, remarried to the man that you knew as your granddad, of course.

26:14.519 --> 26:21.065
But this is certainly a history of World War II and a book written that's certainly obviously very, very meaningful to you.

26:21.086 --> 26:22.407
Still the greatest generation, that is.

26:22.427 --> 26:23.668
Exactly, exactly.

26:24.104 --> 26:24.845
That's very impressive.

26:24.865 --> 26:30.251
You're a past commander of VFW Post 4692, something that you're very proud of.

26:30.471 --> 26:30.651
Yes, sir.

26:30.712 --> 26:34.035
We could do a whole other show about what the VFW does.

26:34.616 --> 26:40.603
But in the few seconds that we have left, talk a little bit about the VFW, because I know that you're trying to bring in younger and younger members.

26:41.083 --> 26:45.829
Well, the VFW's goal in life is to honor the dead by serving the living.

26:46.369 --> 26:52.997
And our goals are to take care of the soldiers today and the people coming back, make sure they have easy transitions.

26:53.365 --> 27:05.120
We're big proponents with the political action committee in Washington, D.C., where we fight for a GI Bill and VA raises and compensation for disabled vets.

27:06.242 --> 27:07.724
There's so much we do.

27:07.784 --> 27:11.268
Plus, we do a lot of the locally in town here.

27:11.308 --> 27:18.057
We do youth programs like the Voice of Democracy and the Patriots Pen, Teacher of the Year, Fireman, Firefighter of the Year.

27:18.442 --> 27:24.830
There's a lot we do locally, too, to try to help, again, to honor the dead by serving the living.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.613
Thank you for your service.

27:26.833 --> 27:27.273
Thank you, sir.

27:28.835 --> 27:39.429
Operation Desert Storm will not take up a vast number of pages in our grandchildren's history books, but for the men and women who fought it and the families who waited it out, its memory will be one of a lifetime.

27:39.509 --> 27:43.214
Bob Bruner is one of the thousands of brave stories from that Gulf War of 91.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.197
We salute him and all veterans.

27:45.637 --> 27:47.740
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:47.740 --> 27:57.473
[Music.]

27:57.473 --> 28:07.200
[Music.]

28:07.200 --> 28:16.200
[Music.]

28:16.200 --> 28:26.000
[Silence.]
