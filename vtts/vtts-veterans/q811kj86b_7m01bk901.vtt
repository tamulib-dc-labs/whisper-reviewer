00:11.101 --> 00:27.777
Thank you.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.621
Hello and welcome to this special edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.001 --> 00:40.564
I'm Tom Turveyville.

00:40.584 --> 00:44.470
And I'm John Bennett, Station Manager and Program Director for KAMU-TV.

00:45.151 --> 00:50.819
It was March 1, 2005 that right here in this studio, we take our very first episode of Veterans of the Valley.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.050
And in that time, we've had the honor to share with you the stories of many military veterans from right here in the Brazos Valley.

00:58.250 --> 01:05.626
This is our 145th original episode of Veterans of the Valley that KAMU has aired in those five plus years.

01:06.067 --> 01:13.643
We've heard in their own words the remarkable stories of service of veterans who have served in World War II and every war since then.

01:14.247 --> 01:26.171
But today, Tom and I will reflect on the show, how it got started, some of the more memorable of those 145 and the impact that you have told us Veterans of the Valley has had on our community in the first five years.

01:26.712 --> 01:30.940
And we're not trying to pat ourselves on the back, John, but more really sort of give tribute to the

01:31.477 --> 01:57.400
over 140 veterans who have sat in that chair that have told us their their story it's it's really been remarkable and like you said the impact that it's had in the community because you and I hear every week from people about boy I like that show or really like that show or I'll tell you somebody you've got to interview it really sort of has had a far-reaching effect there's not a week that goes by time that we don't get a call or somebody on the street says something about being on the show

01:57.768 --> 01:59.492
liking the show, loving the show.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.794
When's the show coming on?

02:00.935 --> 02:02.017
Tom does a great job.

02:02.117 --> 02:03.300
Everybody's got their heart in it.

02:03.901 --> 02:07.268
It's one of the best shows that we've got on KAMU TV.

02:07.288 --> 02:11.076
Sort of tell people sort of the genesis of this show and how it got started.

02:11.116 --> 02:11.878
It was actually

02:12.348 --> 02:22.063
the fall of 2004 and you and I were at a social event together and you kind of cornered me and you kind of came up with this idea.

02:22.083 --> 02:28.433
I had this idea because I listened to you on the radio and I knew your passion was talking about and respecting our veterans.

02:28.936 --> 02:32.961
And I've had this idea for a long time because I never got called to serve.

02:33.322 --> 02:38.168
I fit in that area after Vietnam and before the next war came along, so I never got called.

02:38.729 --> 02:41.232
And I know you had a common experience with that as well.

02:41.272 --> 02:43.014
Your number didn't get picked up.

02:43.034 --> 02:44.356
Right, in the old lottery.

02:44.376 --> 02:45.337
In the old lottery days.

02:46.018 --> 02:51.745
And I felt this need to do something to respect our veterans because here's people that have given their time, their lives.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.848
They've done things to serve our country.

02:54.409 --> 02:56.952
And there are people that have a story to tell.

02:57.252 --> 02:59.776
And I knew that people needed to tell their story.

02:59.896 --> 03:06.004
And from an occurrence with my father in law, Ralph Patterson, we call him Pat Patterson.

03:06.024 --> 03:06.205
Right.

03:06.766 --> 03:09.049
Military man, Marine, career Marine.

03:09.770 --> 03:12.854
And he was telling my son the story of his time in Vietnam.

03:12.894 --> 03:17.040
He did several tours in Vietnam, lost several men under his service.

03:17.060 --> 03:24.711
And when I saw him begin to become emotional about telling his story, I began to understand that this is something he's never told anyone before.

03:25.265 --> 03:28.710
and there's a need for other men and women to do the same thing.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.433
And I thought, who better to do this job than Tom Turveyville?

03:31.874 --> 03:37.621
So when I saw you at that reception, I think it took five seconds, and you said, absolutely, count me in.

03:37.641 --> 03:41.326
You bet, and you and I had a meeting later on, and we sort of pounded out the details of it.

03:42.027 --> 03:48.876
And sure enough, like you said, March 1st of 2005 is when we taped the first show with Dr. Jim Cooper.

03:48.856 --> 04:13.108
who by the way dr jim cooper is the only veteran that we've had on twice on this two different episodes of this show i think about two years ago we had him back again to sort of talk about the beginnings of the of the veteran show so he's been a big part of this show but like you said john i did not serve either in the military i was during the days of the during vietnam when they had the first draft lottery and i was

04:13.561 --> 04:18.069
Fortunate, I guess, if that's the word, that my birthday did not come up early.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.293
So I stayed in school and didn't serve.

04:20.373 --> 04:22.416
But I, like you, had family.

04:22.477 --> 04:27.806
My mother's first husband was a Navy pilot instructor who was killed in World War II, actually.

04:28.026 --> 04:29.008
Yeah, he was in service.

04:29.389 --> 04:29.869
Exactly.

04:30.110 --> 04:34.718
And my mother remarried, and that's how I came along from that second marriage.

04:34.738 --> 04:37.122
But again, the passion...

04:37.422 --> 04:57.287
that i've had has really sort of grown from that from hearing stories from my mother of her first husband and his world war ii service but we've had a lot of great great veterans on this show and some of them that we might go ahead and talk about from the outset we had a show just a few weeks ago a memorial day special talking about

04:57.267 --> 05:00.030
some of the veterans who we've lost that have been on the show.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.214
And that number is 11 now that are no longer with us.

05:03.234 --> 05:07.879
But we knew, of course, that that would happen with so many World War II veterans that have sat in that chair.

05:08.179 --> 05:08.599
That's right.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.542
It's inevitable that it's going to happen.

05:11.282 --> 05:11.603
Indeed.

05:11.623 --> 05:15.847
But we feel honored that we can have the privilege to capture their memory.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.109
I think about my family.

05:17.169 --> 05:21.133
My father, he was boot camp prepared to go to Korea but never had to.

05:21.674 --> 05:24.557
I never knew much about that as I was growing up.

05:24.908 --> 05:29.954
Through my wife's side of the family, we have someone in every branch of the military except for the Coast Guard, I think.

05:30.955 --> 05:37.003
I've had my little brother Thunderbirds, a very distinguished service, but they never talk about it much.

05:37.023 --> 05:46.174
To have a man sit here and talk about his story, and this is something that is near the end of their life before they begin to realize they need to say that part of their life.

05:46.913 --> 05:50.239
And for you to get that information out of them is no small task.

05:50.659 --> 05:56.049
Indeed, because it's there forever and it's very important for their families, especially those that we've lost.

05:56.089 --> 06:04.523
And certainly there will be those who will go after them, too, that, again, have been here and told their stories.

06:06.266 --> 06:10.153
The oldest veteran that we've had on this show, as a matter of fact,

06:10.606 --> 06:17.632
is Sharon Colson's uncle, Eddie Thompson, who was, I believe, 98 years old when he was on our show.

06:17.652 --> 06:21.426
He passed away just a few days shy of 100 years old, but he was

06:21.828 --> 06:26.573
He was one of our first veterans and the first one who actually passed away.

06:27.474 --> 06:37.826
Speck Gammon, who was the old sports information director at Texas A&M, who actually, I followed him in that same position at Texas A&M when I first came to town in 1984.

06:38.006 --> 06:47.937
He was on our show, Raymond Schultz, Tom Browning, Rich Thomas, a Korean War veteran who we lost in 2008.

06:48.355 --> 06:52.579
Jim West was really a tragic story of his death.

06:53.540 --> 06:58.404
Jim was a Vietnam veteran, just that chiseled look Vietnam veteran.

06:58.424 --> 07:03.349
If you were going to do a poster boy of the Vietnam Marine, he was the guy.

07:03.569 --> 07:05.211
He won three Purple Hearts.

07:05.231 --> 07:17.282
He would only accept two of them because the reason he only accepted two of the Purple Hearts, and I'll never forget him telling me this, was because he didn't want his mother to get that third knock on the door.

07:17.768 --> 07:21.703
to tell her that his son had been wounded again in Vietnam.

07:21.723 --> 07:25.095
She got two knocks on the door to say or letters.

07:25.413 --> 07:31.941
But didn't want his mother to get that third knock on the door, so he refused his third Purple Heart so she wouldn't get the word.

07:33.322 --> 07:43.695
We had Jim on the show, and just a few weeks after we recorded the show, just a very freakish thing, he was bit by a rattlesnake on his farm, and he died from the rattlesnake bite.

07:43.715 --> 07:46.758
And that was just one of the more shocking deaths to me.

07:46.798 --> 07:47.699
To go through the war.

07:47.719 --> 07:49.421
To go through the war and a rattlesnake.

07:49.521 --> 07:50.563
And then a rattlesnake gets you at home.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.585
Right, he was a former sheriff out in Madison County.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.207
Calvin Boykin Jr.

07:54.267 --> 07:58.353
was the first veteran who told us a story that couldn't be told in 30 minutes.

07:58.393 --> 08:04.682
I had to do a two-parter with Cal Boykin because he was a tank commander in World War II.

08:04.802 --> 08:05.563
Tremendous story.

08:07.446 --> 08:15.117
Never forget Albert Novak, a fellow who served in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, all three branches of the military.

08:16.218 --> 08:17.340
One of Albert's

08:18.029 --> 08:41.539
family one of his nephews called me up one day and said would you put my uncle on his on your show he's got he's got pancreatic cancer and he doesn't have long to live and he's just a ball of fire and I'd love for him to tell the story and sure enough I went over I talked to Al we visited I went and picked him up we came back we did the show we put the show on quickly because we knew that Al was very sick

08:42.278 --> 08:43.401
Al got to see the show.

08:43.421 --> 08:45.327
His family got to see the show with him.

08:45.347 --> 08:49.139
And sure enough, just a couple of weeks after that, you know, we did lose him.

08:49.781 --> 08:52.870
And Dick Davidson, what a tremendous personality.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.415
World War II ground soldier.

08:54.968 --> 09:01.097
who told us about something called Operation Keelhaul in World War II that I'd never known about.

09:01.118 --> 09:02.800
And David West, U.S.

09:02.820 --> 09:08.669
Navy veteran from Navasota, who just passed away this last April, as a matter of fact.

09:08.689 --> 09:13.737
And just a few days ago, before we're taping this show, we lost our city councilman, Larry Stewart.

09:14.071 --> 09:17.400
who was a veteran, who was one of our guests on this show.

09:18.744 --> 09:20.368
He was my neighbor and good friend.

09:20.589 --> 09:21.231
Right.

09:21.251 --> 09:21.491
U.S.

09:21.552 --> 09:21.933
Navy.

09:21.953 --> 09:24.760
And of course, we all miss Larry, who just passed away.

09:25.222 --> 09:29.413
So, you know, for those that have passed and those that are still with us, we certainly thank

09:29.798 --> 09:33.006
all of them that have sat in that chair as a matter of fact.

09:33.026 --> 09:36.615
You've got to have great respect and admiration for every person that's done that.

09:37.156 --> 09:41.286
Man, woman, whomever they are, they've done something that I've never gotten to do.

09:41.928 --> 09:46.018
And I have such admiration for what they've done to protect my freedoms and your freedoms and

09:46.589 --> 09:51.457
give us the ability to be here today to do this kind of a program and everything else we do in our lives.

09:51.757 --> 09:57.046
I know you spend a lot of time with these people, Tom, when you interview them, prepare for the show.

09:57.486 --> 10:02.414
I do, and that is really one of the most thrilling things about being able to do this show.

10:02.514 --> 10:07.542
The 28 and a half minutes that we spend here on the set with the cameras and the lights, that's a neat thing.

10:07.562 --> 10:09.345
That's just a little piece of what really happens.

10:09.405 --> 10:14.453
That's just a little piece of what really happens because every one of the veterans who have appeared on this show

10:15.142 --> 10:39.090
I've had the opportunity to go to their home a few days before we taped the show and sit down in their living room or at their kitchen table and sit and talk to them for an hour, hour and a half, couple of hours, even as long as three hours with some of them, and really just hear their story, their whole story about their service and about their families and how they grew up and how they got into the service.

10:39.492 --> 10:47.264
and their close calls and their relationship with their families and their military mates and the people that they still keep in contact with.

10:47.284 --> 10:53.553
And these are just remarkable stories that I've had the sense to record with a little digital recorder.

10:53.573 --> 10:59.903
And I've got all of those archived, all of those long form conversations with every one of our veterans.

10:59.923 --> 11:05.972
And that's been the really neat thing is to be able to go to their homes and talk to them to sort of get an idea.

11:06.408 --> 11:12.357
and sort of get to sort of the you know the behind the scenes of what we do.

11:12.557 --> 11:25.497
What I'll do is I'll go and I'll visit with these veterans and I'll record our whole conversation and then I will go home and on the day that we record the show that morning I'll re-listen to our whole conversation and I'll take notes.

11:25.628 --> 11:31.818
and I'll type notes and I'll print them out and those are all the papers that you see on the table on the desk all the time.

11:31.858 --> 11:36.827
Those are the notes that I have to sort of lead him in the conversation with the show.

11:36.847 --> 11:40.633
So that's sort of how it works and I get a chance to visit with all of those veterans.

11:40.813 --> 11:42.416
And that's a special time for you too.

11:42.596 --> 11:43.017
Oh yeah.

11:43.037 --> 11:46.202
Because you get something that the rest of us don't get in that

11:46.182 --> 11:47.885
up to three hour long time.

11:48.085 --> 11:48.686
Right.

11:48.706 --> 11:48.986
Right.

11:49.006 --> 11:51.891
Because we have to squeeze that into less than 30 minutes.

11:52.271 --> 11:52.792
In most cases.

11:52.812 --> 11:53.553
That's a tough job.

11:53.673 --> 12:00.464
And in a lot of cases, I know immediately when I'm visiting with them that this is going to be a double episode or a two-part episode.

12:00.764 --> 12:09.097
I know immediately that it is because their stories are so compelling that there's no way that we can do justice to their story in just one program.

12:09.137 --> 12:11.380
And those are the programs like Dick Davidson or like

12:11.697 --> 12:21.009
Calvin Boykin, other stories that we've run into two parts because their stories are just worth that much time on the TV.

12:21.269 --> 12:23.072
And there's some that I could have done three or four parts.

12:23.472 --> 12:27.377
Like Al Meyer, who spent six years as a POW in Vietnam.

12:27.658 --> 12:28.399
People like that.

12:28.419 --> 12:31.803
Things like that, experiences we never hope we have to have.

12:31.823 --> 12:33.245
But these men have done that.

12:33.265 --> 12:34.086
They've lived through it.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.489
They brought the stories back.

12:36.609 --> 12:39.453
And somehow you also bring in a little bit of their personal life.

12:39.473 --> 12:40.995
We see a little glimpse of family.

12:41.313 --> 12:42.795
in addition to the war story.

12:42.815 --> 12:51.449
When we have time at the end, I like to do that when we do because to talk about their kids and their grandkids and their spouses.

12:51.569 --> 12:55.054
And many of these World War II veterans have been married more than once.

12:55.215 --> 13:00.763
Their wife either passed away and they've remarried some of them in a lot of cases.

13:00.783 --> 13:02.326
And these are interesting stories too.

13:02.867 --> 13:05.110
Men or women who have...

13:05.562 --> 13:08.125
who have had more than one true love in their life.

13:08.185 --> 13:17.057
And these are fun stories to hear that they have found life again after they may have lost a spouse after their service, say, in World War II.

13:17.417 --> 13:18.399
Well, they're real people.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.101
They're like us.

13:20.782 --> 13:21.523
They've got a life.

13:21.563 --> 13:22.384
They've got family.

13:22.724 --> 13:26.429
And it's more than guns and bullets and tanks and planes and things like that.

13:26.669 --> 13:28.752
That's the fun, sensational part.

13:28.799 --> 13:35.841
But to go home to a family, that's the hard part to go home and have to maybe not talk about your story.

13:36.042 --> 13:36.965
Right, right.

13:36.985 --> 13:37.948
One guy I need to mention.

13:38.367 --> 13:43.055
And there's so many people that we can mention in our little 28 and a half minutes that we don't get much time here.

13:43.195 --> 13:44.016
We don't get much time.

13:44.036 --> 13:56.336
But one guy I've got to mention is sort of this whole thing started for me on the radio in 1999 on WTAW with a show that I do called Bravo Brazos Valley, where every week I would feature a veteran.

13:56.356 --> 13:59.121
And that's how this all got started and what you heard on the radio.

13:59.181 --> 14:00.062
And that's how we did it.

14:00.543 --> 14:04.189
And that all got started on the back porch of a fellow named Al Hanson.

14:04.574 --> 14:05.797
Al Tex Hanson.

14:05.817 --> 14:06.840
They call him Uncle Al.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.484
He still lives here in Bryan.

14:08.524 --> 14:11.832
He's just a delightful gentleman and one of my very closest friends.

14:11.872 --> 14:13.296
I love Al to death.

14:13.316 --> 14:15.621
And one day I was invited to Al's Back Porch.

14:15.882 --> 14:16.945
That was a special time.

14:16.965 --> 14:21.115
That was a great place to be was Al's Back Porch because it's there that

14:21.770 --> 14:35.110
A lot of his World War II veterans get together on his back porch and just tell lies and tell the truth and tell all the stories of World War II and their experiences and just sitting there and listening to them all.

14:35.130 --> 14:36.752
And that's where I first met Al Hanson.

14:36.772 --> 14:42.220
That's where I first met Dr. Jim Cooper, Glenn Morgan, who served on the USS Indianapolis.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.342
He was the bugler.

14:43.362 --> 14:49.110
He was the bugler on the USS Indianapolis and spent five nights floating in the Pacific until they were rescued.

14:49.715 --> 14:50.346
E.S.

14:50.529 --> 14:52.097
Edmunds who worked in the Pentagon,

14:52.465 --> 14:56.270
I'm forgetting some of the names of the people that I met on Uncle Al's back porch.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.513
But, yeah, that was a great place to be.

14:58.533 --> 15:05.943
But that's sort of where my passion for Brazos Valley veterans were born on Al's back porch.

15:05.963 --> 15:08.627
So, Al, if you're watching, thank you very much.

15:09.007 --> 15:09.989
I love you more, buddy.

15:10.469 --> 15:15.115
And thanks a lot for sort of being there and getting me started on all of this.

15:15.135 --> 15:16.858
That's a time where guys can just be guys.

15:17.078 --> 15:17.258
Yeah.

15:17.639 --> 15:20.042
Whether it's truth or not, the stories are always...

15:20.326 --> 15:21.968
They're always better the second time around.

15:22.028 --> 15:23.830
And they're mostly true.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.011
And they're mostly true.

15:25.472 --> 15:25.932
That's right.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.996
They're usually lying when they're talking about the girlfriends is what they're doing, you know, or their wives.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.080
But a lot of great people that I met on there.

15:33.280 --> 15:44.192
We've got some photographs, and these photographs are really of no one in particular, no people in particular, but just photographs that sort of represent those who I've interviewed.

15:44.232 --> 15:45.253
And these are...

15:45.233 --> 15:47.696
Old World War II photographs and some even newer.

15:47.716 --> 15:51.542
This is James Wade, who was one of our guests here.

15:51.562 --> 15:53.625
He fought in Europe in World War II.

15:54.065 --> 16:03.078
And the interesting thing with James Wade is that part of his duty was to pull guard duty over the witnesses of the Nuremberg trials.

16:03.098 --> 16:05.802
And that was just a part of his story that was incredible.

16:05.822 --> 16:13.232
And this is a picture of him in Germany when he was pulling that duty, guarding the witnesses of the Nuremberg trial.

16:13.252 --> 16:13.873
And...

16:14.191 --> 16:19.843
He had a story one time of how he had to fight off a crazed German and fell in self-defense combat.

16:19.863 --> 16:22.228
But that's James Wade from the Brazos Valley.

16:22.608 --> 16:23.851
This is Jim Robbins.

16:23.871 --> 16:24.913
Grew up in Corpus Christi.

16:24.933 --> 16:27.599
He was a Vietnam helicopter pilot.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.004
He flew Hueys and Loaches.

16:30.104 --> 16:31.086
First Cav.

16:31.454 --> 16:36.639
If you saw the movie, We Were Soldiers and the Helicopter Pilots, well, that's what Jim Robbins did.

16:36.659 --> 16:42.885
He was a chopper pilot that flew into the Que Son Valley and other hot spots of Vietnam.

16:42.905 --> 16:45.588
So you talk about a real Vietnam hero.

16:45.668 --> 16:46.729
That's Jim Robbins.

16:47.129 --> 16:53.596
Yolanda Kozlowski, one of the female veterans that we've had on our show.

16:53.616 --> 16:58.120
She was part of the 100th evac hospital, attached to Patton's army.

16:58.488 --> 17:06.740
She was one of the first people to treat wounded soldiers in World War II and triage.

17:07.581 --> 17:09.204
Some amazing stories to tell.

17:09.264 --> 17:16.455
And she had to make some difficult decisions of life and death and who could be treated and who couldn't be treated during World War II.

17:16.575 --> 17:18.217
She's a remarkable lady.

17:18.237 --> 17:24.166
And her husband, Ed Kozlowski, also was one of our veteran guests here on Veterans of the Valley.

17:24.186 --> 17:25.007
This is H.J.

17:25.027 --> 17:25.508
Marsh.

17:25.977 --> 17:30.604
And I've included this picture because what a good looking soldier that guy is.

17:30.624 --> 17:33.888
You talk about, you think he had any trouble getting dates when he was young?

17:33.949 --> 17:34.229
I bet not.

17:34.249 --> 17:35.150
He probably did pretty good.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.532
He probably did pretty good.

17:36.592 --> 17:37.474
And H.J.

17:37.534 --> 17:41.199
fought both in World War II and in Korea.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.003
End of World War II and the Korean War.

17:44.894 --> 18:04.776
This is Hazel Von Rader who did not serve overseas but she did serve as a nurse at Fort Bliss at the Beaumont Hospital there in Fort Bliss and then later she flew on airplanes that went out and got wounded soldiers

18:05.262 --> 18:09.237
uh, and brought them back to San Antonio, to Fort Sam Houston.

18:09.277 --> 18:16.082
And she used to, she would treat soldiers and nurses who were part of, uh, Corregidor and, uh,

18:16.467 --> 18:21.233
Bataan in Japan and in Manila and the Philippines.

18:21.853 --> 18:23.976
Quite a lady who lives in Bryan.

18:23.996 --> 18:24.677
And that's Hazel.

18:25.037 --> 18:30.263
This is Dr. Jim Cooper in his younger days, our very first veteran on Veterans of the Valley.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.985
Looks like a spry young man there.

18:32.005 --> 18:32.826
Dr. Jim, yeah.

18:32.846 --> 18:42.137
He was a Navy doctor and a personal physician to many a famous admiral and military man when he was stationed in Washington and on board ship.

18:42.488 --> 18:47.117
Dr. Jim is very special, and he's my doctor also, and still practicing.

18:47.618 --> 18:50.363
Norman Beale from the Brazos County.

18:50.424 --> 18:54.051
He's 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, assault on Korea.

18:55.534 --> 19:00.964
Never forgotten the horror and the cold of the winter when he scaled the beaches at Inchon.

19:01.064 --> 19:03.990
Norman and his wife, Wanda, live in the country with a

19:04.291 --> 19:08.915
couple of their friendly dogs, and he was one of our more recent guests on Veterans of the Valley.

19:09.796 --> 19:18.545
Next is Cal Boykin, the late Cal Boykin, 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion, who was one of our two-part episodes.

19:18.605 --> 19:23.390
His daughter, Ann Boykin, runs Project Hold over at the City of College Station.

19:23.410 --> 19:34.180
And we lost Cal just about a year ago, but he was a tank commander in World War II and a very, very interesting fellow.

19:34.767 --> 19:39.712
This next picture is one of my favorite pictures that we've ever put on Veterans of the Valley because it tells a story.

19:40.212 --> 19:48.240
This is Gary Banta, who is the commander of the American Legion Post here in Bryant College Station, Earl Graham Post 159.

19:49.161 --> 19:54.486
He served in Vietnam in truck convoys delivering supplies to hotspots.

19:55.187 --> 20:04.015
And John, if a picture ever told a story of a young, lonely Vietnam soldier a long, long way from home,

20:04.298 --> 20:09.125
and wondering what the heck is next coming for me in my life, this picture tells it.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.873
This tells the story of the lonely, brave, but somewhat scared soldier in Vietnam.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.677
That is it right there, because here's the man by himself.

20:17.697 --> 20:19.059
And you can see it in his eyes.

20:19.159 --> 20:19.519
You can.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.701
What is going to happen?

20:20.721 --> 20:21.182
That's right.

20:21.422 --> 20:22.844
Where am I and when will I be home?

20:23.405 --> 20:24.366
That's Gary Banta.

20:24.818 --> 20:26.762
Mike Guidry, good buddy of mine.

20:26.802 --> 20:32.893
This is one of our Iraq veterans who served in Iraq in a CB battalion.

20:32.993 --> 20:39.024
They built stuff in Iraq, built stuff for Marine outfits.

20:39.044 --> 20:42.690
So he was a Navy CB and he's still a good friend of mine.

20:42.750 --> 20:49.122
And he works over at Texas A&M and has a baby and a baby on the way.

20:49.844 --> 20:50.986
and good friends of mine.

20:51.447 --> 20:52.850
Ray Akins is on the right.

20:53.171 --> 20:55.676
Ray Akins, a remarkable story.

20:55.696 --> 21:03.072
He fought in the Pacific's bloodiest battle of World War II, 82 days fighting at Okinawa, 1st Marine Division.

21:03.092 --> 21:06.840
He was on the third wave to storm the beach in April of 1945.

21:06.820 --> 21:10.545
And Ray really has three stories, and you might be able to tell from that picture.

21:10.745 --> 21:14.389
One of his stories is, matter of fact, let's go to the next picture.

21:14.409 --> 21:22.199
One of his stories is for 36 years, he was one of the legendary football coaches in Texas, high school football coaches at Gregory Portland.

21:22.219 --> 21:28.126
And this picture is taken when they named the Gregory Portland Wildcat Stadium after him just about a year ago.

21:28.907 --> 21:33.553
And the people in the previous picture and this picture, you may recognize the fellow on the left.

21:33.837 --> 21:37.204
because he had a pretty good year in athletics this last year.

21:37.244 --> 21:39.850
That's Drew Brees, and that's Ray Aiken's grandson.

21:40.010 --> 21:40.772
He did okay.

21:40.832 --> 21:41.573
He did okay.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.377
Super Bowl MVP.

21:43.958 --> 21:46.424
And the fellow on the right is Marty Aikens.

21:46.444 --> 21:49.450
That's Drew's uncle, who was a quarterback at the University of Texas.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.757
Darryl Royals, last All-American quarterback, as a matter of fact.

21:52.737 --> 22:01.888
And Ray Akins not only had the story of service in Okinawa in World War II, but some great stories as a high school football coach and being Drew Brees' uncle.

22:02.369 --> 22:04.231
Proud family picture right there.

22:04.571 --> 22:12.381
And he also told a story, quite matter-of-factly, about how both the University of Texas and Texas A&M passed on him in recruiting.

22:12.401 --> 22:17.267
Didn't think he really fit in either program, so he went to Purdue and played football instead.

22:17.287 --> 22:18.629
And we all know what happened.

22:18.829 --> 22:20.851
He won the Super Bowl and became the MVP.

22:20.931 --> 22:21.512
Well, we don't.

22:21.492 --> 22:22.553
Hit it all the time.

22:22.573 --> 22:24.115
We don't hit them all the time.

22:24.155 --> 22:26.659
This is Al Meyer, one of our most compelling stories.

22:26.759 --> 22:36.952
Al spent six years as a POW in Vietnam, and this was him returning from being a POW, returning to the United States, getting off the plane, and being greeted.

22:37.032 --> 22:38.494
We have some more pictures coming up.

22:38.514 --> 22:47.866
This is a sketch that depicted Al at the Hanoi Hilton, and some of the treatment that they received at the Hanoi Hilton.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.288
That was a sketch.

22:49.673 --> 22:51.776
Folks, welcoming Al home.

22:52.457 --> 23:05.438
Al was an Aggie class of 1960, is an Aggie class of 1960, and his last picture was him greeting his wife, Bobby, when he came home from six years as a POW in Vietnam.

23:05.458 --> 23:14.112
And just recently, John, of course, Kyle Netterville and I got the opportunity to go on the Lone Star Honor Flight with about 100 veterans from the area.

23:14.497 --> 23:16.439
to Washington, D.C.

23:17.180 --> 23:21.785
And some of the pictures from that that we just had to show, that was Jim Cooper that you just saw.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.109
That's me at the World War II Memorial.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.772
Frank Coachman is on the left.

23:27.972 --> 23:32.317
Joe Hanover is next to him and then myself.

23:32.697 --> 23:36.101
And then Frank Lederich, to all the three who have been guests on Veterans of the Valley.

23:36.662 --> 23:40.606
That was the entire group saluting at Arlington National Cemetery there.

23:41.527 --> 23:43.930
And just to show that we really did work

23:44.635 --> 23:50.182
me taping a promo there in front of the Iwo Jima Memorial there in Washington, D.C.

23:50.322 --> 23:53.066
So that's just some of the photographs.

23:53.226 --> 23:57.572
It's sort of representative of sort of what we've done here on Veterans of the Valley.

23:58.013 --> 23:59.835
There's so many other pictures we could have shown.

24:00.376 --> 24:01.357
Yeah, that's the thing.

24:01.377 --> 24:05.142
There's so much to talk about and so much we have to sift through.

24:05.881 --> 24:29.661
there's so many people that have served and that's just here in the brazos valley right we didn't even begin to think about the state the country all the hundreds and hundreds of men that could have been on this program right you had to choose among these 145 so far that's right and there's still a lot more to go i mean this i don't want people to think that just because we're doing this show here all we're doing is just uh recognizing our first five years on the on the air we're not going away

24:29.641 --> 24:39.016
I want another five years and another five years after that, and then somebody by then will take my place here in this seat and hope that they just keep going and going and going.

24:39.116 --> 24:46.087
Because we want to get those World War II veterans on, obviously, because we're losing them, what do they say, at the rate of a thousand a day.

24:46.187 --> 24:47.529
Yeah, it's way too fast.

24:48.070 --> 24:48.831
That's the sad part.

24:48.851 --> 24:49.672
We're not going away.

24:50.413 --> 24:51.415
That's the good news.

24:51.435 --> 24:53.278
The sad news is we're not going away.

24:53.799 --> 24:57.184
There's that many more men that have paid this price and have done...

24:57.552 --> 24:59.454
these wonderful things for us.

24:59.474 --> 24:59.735
Indeed.

25:01.056 --> 25:04.280
People ask me who are some of the more memorable people that we've had on the show.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.281
You know, where do you start?

25:06.262 --> 25:21.180
Ed Eyre was a Marine who actually was there on D-Day at Iwo Jima and who stormed the beach with the Marines and was there at the taking of Mount Suribachi and when the flag was lifted.

25:21.548 --> 25:23.091
at the top of Mount Suribachi.

25:23.111 --> 25:23.572
He was there.

25:23.612 --> 25:26.638
He didn't witness the flag lifting because he was fighting the war.

25:26.678 --> 25:27.761
He was kind of busy that day.

25:27.781 --> 25:28.642
He was kind of busy.

25:29.103 --> 25:35.777
General John Miller, Lieutenant General, Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic Commanding General,

25:36.044 --> 25:37.025
has been on the show.

25:37.926 --> 25:43.711
Ken Loveless, helicopter chopper pilot in Vietnam.

25:43.991 --> 25:46.474
And all these guys live here, right where we live.

25:46.514 --> 25:48.095
That's the interesting part about this.

25:48.135 --> 25:49.697
These guys live here.

25:49.717 --> 25:51.458
It's not like it's in a book somewhere.

25:51.719 --> 25:52.259
They live here.

25:52.820 --> 25:53.520
They're your neighbors.

25:53.540 --> 25:56.563
They're your people that you're checking out next to in the grocery store.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.626
They're the people that you see in the movies and at the library.

25:59.646 --> 26:01.828
And they are our neighbors.

26:01.848 --> 26:04.110
And a lot of people that you go to church with,

26:04.411 --> 26:11.718
And a lot of the people, I get a lot of comments saying, hey, I've lived next door to that guy for 10 years and I never knew that story.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.819
That's why I think we're so relevant, though.

26:13.839 --> 26:25.170
And one thing you and I discussed earlier is, and this is sort of an amazing deal, too, is a lot of these people, for whatever reason, will tell their stories to me, a person that they've just met, pretty much a stranger.

26:25.710 --> 26:32.376
And these are stories that they have not been able to tell to their own families or their own families haven't thought to ask.

26:32.356 --> 26:43.386
And I've had a lot of family members come to me and said, my dad or my granddad said some things to you that we were able to capture on Veterans of the Valley that we've never heard before.

26:43.786 --> 26:54.857
And now because of that, because they have the DVD of the show, they'll be able to take that DVD and hand it down to his kids, grandkids, great grandkids, and it'll be there forever.

26:55.197 --> 26:59.781
And that's something that's so special to us because they might never have told that story at all.

27:00.166 --> 27:01.528
They really may not have.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.272
So thanks to you, they've been able to express that.

27:04.292 --> 27:04.933
Indeed.

27:04.953 --> 27:07.096
And again, our 28 and a half minutes is over.

27:07.116 --> 27:08.177
So we've got to go.

27:08.197 --> 27:10.120
But it's been a great time.

27:10.140 --> 27:16.669
You know, I would like to consider that these first five years of Veterans of the Valley are a pretty good start.

27:16.689 --> 27:20.875
But I know that there are lots of stories of service out there still left to tell.

27:21.310 --> 27:32.041
We'd like to give a special thanks to the student production assistants, not only those working this program you're watching right now, those many young men and women who've come and gone over the last five years.

27:32.061 --> 27:33.943
They worked so hard to help produce this show.

27:34.143 --> 27:39.348
And my own sincere thanks to Dr. Rod Zent, to John Bennett, Kyle Netterville, Sandra Harris.

27:39.368 --> 27:46.896
Special thanks to Walter Sanchez and the rest of the staff here at KAMU for making Veterans of the Valley what we always wanted it to be.

27:46.876 --> 27:49.086
So for John Bennett, I'm Tom Turveyville.

27:49.106 --> 27:50.030
Join us next week.

27:50.512 --> 27:53.325
We'll start the next five years of Veterans of the Valley.
