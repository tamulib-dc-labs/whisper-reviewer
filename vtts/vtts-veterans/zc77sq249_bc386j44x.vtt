00:33.696 --> 00:34.717
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:35.037 --> 00:36.079
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.122 --> 00:45.200
World War II was won by men and women all pulling their weight, doing their job, whether it was fighting on the front lines or serving on the chow lines.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.284
When Brian's W.S.

00:47.305 --> 00:56.565
Edmonds, A&M class of 1938, enlisted in 1942, just two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he had field artillery in mind.

00:56.967 --> 01:03.857
He spent a lot of his early time in the Army training ragtag replacements stateside for overseas duty.

01:03.878 --> 01:09.947
But then his branch's orders were changed to postal duty, but sorting mail in Louisiana was not how W.S.

01:10.087 --> 01:12.070
Edmonds wanted to spend the war.

01:12.090 --> 01:16.056
If he was gonna stay in the States, he wanted to be where the action was.

01:16.036 --> 01:23.125
So he got himself transferred to Washington, D.C., the Pentagon, a part of the Army's Courier Transport Service.

01:23.145 --> 01:24.347
It was mostly top secret.

01:24.947 --> 01:27.391
It had to get from one place to another, and W.S.

01:27.411 --> 01:31.616
Edmonds was one of the soldiers the Army depended on to get it there.

01:31.636 --> 01:33.519
Today, retired Major W.S.

01:33.639 --> 01:41.689
Edmonds and his wife, Ellie, live in Bryan, a proud past commander of the local American Legion and quartermaster of the VFW.

01:42.766 --> 01:43.907
Major Edmonds, welcome.

01:44.168 --> 01:45.910
Nice to have you here on the show.

01:45.930 --> 01:49.214
Let's go back to that part when you first enlisted.

01:49.234 --> 01:54.120
And you went to Fort Sill, and you were training just rag-tag enlisted recruits.

01:54.361 --> 01:57.404
Well, first I went to Camp Roberts in California.

01:57.424 --> 01:57.665
Right.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.910
Through basic training and then preparatory OCS.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.293
And then I was promoted to corporal.

02:04.313 --> 02:08.959
And then I went from there to OCS at Fort Sill, class of 39.

02:10.002 --> 02:13.346
And you were training these recruits that were just pretty raw kids, right?

02:13.366 --> 02:23.097
Well, after I went through OCS, a second lieutenant, I was assigned there at Fort Shield in the training replacement center.

02:25.359 --> 02:32.087
Recruits were there for six weeks, training and all in basic training, the first time in the Army.

02:33.268 --> 02:35.711
So that was sometimes very interesting.

02:35.731 --> 02:36.351
I bet it was.

02:36.391 --> 02:37.393
I mean, these were raw kids.

02:37.413 --> 02:39.655
I guess you had to get on them every once in a while, right?

02:40.107 --> 02:42.310
Yes, I didn't have any trouble.

02:43.411 --> 02:49.419
We would, if anyone gave us any trouble, we'd go outside and drill, and the whole unit would go.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.223
So they kept everybody in line.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.425
Kept them in shape.

02:54.445 --> 03:01.033
Now, as a member of the 102nd Division Artillery, at first you thought that you were preparing to go overseas.

03:01.414 --> 03:02.075
Yes, I did.

03:02.095 --> 03:04.798
But then things changed real quickly.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.667
Fort Sill, and when it was assigned to the 102nd Division, they were on maneuvers in Louisiana.

03:11.668 --> 03:12.550
And I stayed there.

03:12.590 --> 03:18.117
Well, we went through maneuvers, and then they changed my branch of service to the AG.

03:18.678 --> 03:18.938
Right.

03:19.079 --> 03:28.071
The Adjutant General's Office changed it to postal service, and you would have gone to Louisiana, what sort, and mail in New Orleans, but that's not what you wanted to do.

03:28.091 --> 03:30.675
Well, they wanted to send me overseas as a postal officer.

03:30.695 --> 03:30.935
Right.

03:31.736 --> 03:34.380
But that's what I didn't like, and so I was able to

03:34.765 --> 03:37.388
to volunteer to go to Washington, D.C.

03:37.408 --> 03:42.115
And what a fascinating job you had there as part of the war courier service.

03:42.876 --> 03:43.857
Talk a little bit about that.

03:43.877 --> 03:45.078
We talked about it earlier.

03:45.879 --> 03:49.084
You woke up every morning and had no idea where they were going to send you.

03:49.104 --> 03:49.664
That's right.

03:49.684 --> 03:54.090
We were in the basement of the Pentagon.

03:54.830 --> 04:00.418
And we carried a little bags with us in case we had left that night or that evening.

04:03.082 --> 04:05.305
It was more or less a 24-hour job.

04:06.526 --> 04:13.737
During the day, most of the officers would go around to different places in the Pentagon building and pick up material.

04:14.938 --> 04:20.626
I made a number of trips during the day to the White House.

04:20.706 --> 04:23.250
Down in the basement, they had what they called a map room.

04:23.939 --> 04:24.720
Yes, sir.

04:24.740 --> 04:32.750
And you had to have a pretty good, well, they notified us, the guard, that we would be there.

04:32.770 --> 04:33.010
Right.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.613
And then they escorted us down to the map room.

04:36.674 --> 04:40.098
I never did get a look in that map room.

04:40.118 --> 04:40.999
You tried to peek in there.

04:41.020 --> 04:43.863
Well, that map room, you know, kept a location of all the troops.

04:44.484 --> 04:44.924
Exactly.

04:45.325 --> 04:48.028
And it was a very top secret place.

04:48.529 --> 04:51.432
I guess this is a place where President Roosevelt spent a lot of time

04:51.715 --> 04:53.437
managing the war at the time, right?

04:53.457 --> 04:54.959
I never did see him there, of course.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.663
Right, right.

04:57.683 --> 05:00.347
This job, though, as a courier, it sent you everywhere.

05:00.387 --> 05:08.438
I know you told me that you went to New York City a dozen times or more, and most of the time you went by train, a few times you got to fly.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.921
Well, just a very few times by plane.

05:11.222 --> 05:11.462
Right.

05:11.582 --> 05:18.752
One time I went to Maine, and I flew back, I think, as far as Boston, and then got a train back into Washington, D.C.,

05:19.525 --> 05:22.448
And you would leave like in the afternoon, you'd leave Washington.

05:22.949 --> 05:29.517
Generally, pick up stuff during the day there in the Pentagon.

05:29.537 --> 05:34.503
And then I suppose they would send that stuff out late in the evening or at night.

05:34.523 --> 05:46.056
So we might sit there all during the day, pick up stuff in the Pentagon, and then at night while the Major would look over there and we didn't know who was going and who wasn't.

05:46.863 --> 05:54.173
And it designate one of us to maybe put us on a train with crypto machines, I believe it was.

05:54.334 --> 05:54.654
Right.

05:55.035 --> 05:59.181
Or sometimes I think we just carried envelopes with our coat.

06:00.763 --> 06:04.248
We were supposed to blend in with the rest of the soldiers.

06:05.670 --> 06:11.678
And we had to be very careful about saying where we may go or what we were doing.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.603
You really weren't supposed to even tell anybody you were a courier.

06:14.703 --> 06:15.324
Is that right?

06:15.344 --> 06:15.604
That's right.

06:15.820 --> 06:20.727
As a matter of fact, I think you told me about one soldier who blabbed a little bit that he was a courier.

06:20.867 --> 06:23.090
He got sent out that day.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.373
I don't know where they've seen him to.

06:25.393 --> 06:26.635
Exactly.

06:27.556 --> 06:32.002
So nobody's supposed to really know what you were doing, much less what you were carrying with you.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.645
Of course, we never knew either.

06:33.665 --> 06:33.925
Right.

06:35.968 --> 06:42.537
Until we started on the way back, after we delivered the merchandise or the envelope or whatever it was,

06:43.276 --> 06:50.889
New York, I went up there about 25 times, I think it was, and never saw New York in the daytime.

06:50.909 --> 06:51.951
You didn't get to party much.

06:52.011 --> 06:59.905
I remember now I went to the Kodak in New York, so evidently it had something to do with Kodak there.

06:59.945 --> 07:02.129
I remember a number of times I went there.

07:02.309 --> 07:04.693
Right, right, right.

07:04.977 --> 07:14.890
But your schedule was you would leave Washington usually in the afternoon, and you'd arrive at your destination, whether it was New York, in the middle of the night, 2, 3, 4 in the morning.

07:15.651 --> 07:16.092
Right.

07:16.172 --> 07:22.240
Or you'd arrive there late that evening and then have to get on the very next transport back.

07:22.300 --> 07:26.525
We ran about every hour at that time from New York to Washington, D.C.

07:28.528 --> 07:32.233
Regardless of what time you got back into Washington, D.C.,

07:32.821 --> 07:36.406
you had to be down in the Pentagon that morning.

07:36.426 --> 07:44.757
Because sometimes you wouldn't get back home until maybe 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning, and you'd grab yourself a nap, and you'd be back at work the next day to find out where they were going to send you.

07:44.777 --> 07:47.321
Now, not all your trips were on the East Coast, you told me.

07:47.842 --> 07:52.368
A couple of times, you went all the way cross-country to San Francisco just to deliver something.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.931
Well, I remember I made two trips to San Francisco.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.117
We carried crypto machines, I believe it was.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.360
It was two of us that put us in a baggage car.

08:01.627 --> 08:02.188
Of the train.

08:02.208 --> 08:09.919
And we had to stay in that baggage car with that roast machine until we had them delivered to the proper headquarters.

08:09.939 --> 08:14.105
In the 1940s, how long a trip was that by train from Washington to San Francisco?

08:14.966 --> 08:19.472
Well, I think it was two nights about, about two nights, I may be wrong.

08:19.492 --> 08:21.114
Yeah, that's a long way.

08:22.296 --> 08:25.120
Well, riding back, we could ride back in style.

08:25.876 --> 08:37.572
But the Major kept a good list of where we were and what train we were supposed to get back, and you better get back on that right train.

08:38.353 --> 08:43.000
The fascinating thing is that every day when you went to work, you didn't know where you were going to be sent.

08:43.661 --> 08:50.069
And you even as a courier, you were, I guess, asked to take things from one office to another right there in the Pentagon.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.693
A lot of it was right there in the Pentagon as far as delivery.

08:53.365 --> 08:55.609
But most of the time you were on the road.

08:55.629 --> 08:58.914
You were out or on the tracks, as it were, right?

08:58.934 --> 08:59.455
That's right.

08:59.816 --> 09:02.480
I went to all the posts, almost Kansas, St.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.242
Louis.

09:03.262 --> 09:03.662
I don't know.

09:03.682 --> 09:05.045
We were constantly on the go.

09:05.305 --> 09:12.157
Now, you told me one time that going to New York, you were able to work, finagle it a little bit to where you were able to make a little extra pocket money.

09:12.377 --> 09:12.978
How did that work?

09:13.399 --> 09:18.327
Well, you had to volunteer at that time as a second lieutenant.

09:18.728 --> 09:20.931
before they'd send you to Washington, D.C.

09:21.251 --> 09:22.233
Of course, I did that.

09:22.333 --> 09:25.437
I volunteered or signed a waiver.

09:25.457 --> 09:33.487
And the government would send us to on the outward trip.

09:34.128 --> 09:43.360
But if you wanted to on your return trip, and it was legal, we could get a vacation ticket and make the little difference in the pay.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.803
Because they'd pay you by the mile when you got back, right?

09:46.003 --> 09:46.484
Yes.

09:46.584 --> 09:46.744
Yeah.

09:47.112 --> 09:48.193
turned out to your benefit.

09:48.273 --> 09:48.874
Yes, it did.

09:48.894 --> 09:51.816
Well, for a young soldier, that always came in handy, right?

09:51.836 --> 09:52.957
That sure did.

09:52.977 --> 10:00.664
Everything that you took, it was assigned to where you had to give it to a specific person, put it in someone's hand, and get a signature for that.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.487
That was part of your duty and part of your job, right?

10:03.507 --> 10:03.607
Yeah.

10:03.627 --> 10:04.568
Yeah, absolutely.

10:05.208 --> 10:10.994
Fascinating work, but then there was a whole other element to your service when later on you were transferred to the Pacific.

10:11.494 --> 10:14.176
Talk about how that came about.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.119
Well, I was there in Washington, D.C.,

10:17.808 --> 10:25.157
And they called, I didn't know where I was going, of course, but they sent a couple of officers down to an examination.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.280
And they failed their examination.

10:29.282 --> 10:33.346
And I went down to the doctor, the captain, I think it was, something like that.

10:33.827 --> 10:35.289
He asked me, what was wrong with you?

10:35.389 --> 10:36.170
What's wrong with you?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.794
I think he had gotten disgusted with the other fellows.

10:39.814 --> 10:41.276
And I said, well, not a whole lot.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.298
So I passed the physical exam.

10:44.299 --> 10:46.482
And I ended up going to San Francisco.

10:47.390 --> 11:00.289
I had actually orders to go to Australia, but in the meantime, they had taken out, I suppose, part of New Guinea, and I ended up in New Guinea at Ora Bay.

11:01.411 --> 11:10.504
And your job that the Army gave you is that you were in charge of setting up several courier stations in different islands in the Pacific.

11:10.905 --> 11:13.549
There was already one set up in Port Moresby,

11:14.322 --> 11:27.360
I think I set up the one in Oral Bay, I knew it, and then I left there after, well, they were still fighting in New Guinea.

11:27.661 --> 11:28.141
Right.

11:28.161 --> 11:31.506
And they got another career transfer to go into New Guinea.

11:32.247 --> 11:35.892
And then later I ended up going to the Taekwondo in the Philippines.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.273
What exactly was involved in setting up these courier stations?

11:39.313 --> 11:41.035
I mean, you go in there, there's nothing there.

11:41.976 --> 11:46.280
You have to pretty much work from scratch to set up these courier stations.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.422
What all was involved in doing that?

11:48.443 --> 11:54.589
Well, of course, I had good orders that I could go to the headquarters without any question.

11:55.290 --> 12:04.559
And they had the furnished with transportation, maybe a place for a little bit of an office or something like that.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.081
Right.

12:07.107 --> 12:11.472
And then I met these planes, like a dad jab.

12:12.313 --> 12:19.762
And from there, when they established the courier station in Hollandia, I could transfer the stuff to the courier officer.

12:22.105 --> 12:32.237
But I would designate an officer that was leaving there to go to Hollandia, and then he'd be met there in Hollandia by this courier transfer officer.

12:33.128 --> 12:48.088
This concept of designating officers to be couriers, I found that very interesting, and that's the way that you got material, top secret material, whatever it was that you were ordered to transport from one place to another.

12:48.148 --> 12:55.558
You would relay it from one place to another, and you had the authority to actually designate couriers

12:55.994 --> 12:58.396
officers who were higher rank even than you were.

12:59.137 --> 13:02.280
Talk about that whole system and how that worked.

13:02.760 --> 13:08.286
And I think later on, you'll talk about one rather famous gentleman that you designated as a courier.

13:08.306 --> 13:14.612
Well, we've given orders that, of course, I knew who would be on the plane ahead of time.

13:14.632 --> 13:14.872
Right.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.493
And how many would be on the plane?

13:16.513 --> 13:18.676
We would put the material on the plane.

13:19.576 --> 13:22.339
And then I had the papers and all of that, the authority.

13:22.741 --> 13:28.728
And then I'd go to the officer and tell him, now you're going to be a courier between here and the land here, maybe, as an example.

13:29.749 --> 13:33.714
And you're responsible for this material regardless of when you get there.

13:34.975 --> 13:47.550
And a lot of them objected to that because it was a responsibility, but I had the authority to do it, and I couldn't even take them off the plane if they didn't do what I told them to do.

13:47.952 --> 13:55.840
So you could tell a higher ranking officer that here's this package and I'm... And that was generally higher ranking officers that were on the planes.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.304
Because at the time you were what, still a second lieutenant or a first lieutenant?

13:59.364 --> 14:00.585
I was a second lieutenant.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.328
I think sometime over there I got promoted to first lieutenant.

14:03.368 --> 14:04.169
To first lieutenant.

14:04.750 --> 14:11.497
So you would go to these officers that were higher ranking than you and say, this package needs to get to where you're going.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.038
That's right.

14:12.058 --> 14:14.280
And you're going to be responsible for it.

14:14.834 --> 14:18.920
And if you refuse, I can take you off the airplane.

14:19.501 --> 14:23.266
So you were lower rank than them, but you could pull rank on them if you wanted to.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.388
I sure could.

14:24.648 --> 14:30.236
And one time it turned out that one of the officers that you designated as a courier was who?

14:30.256 --> 14:31.598
It was Charles Lindbergh.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.241
Talk about that.

14:33.261 --> 14:36.586
I think he was either a lieutenant, I believe he was a lieutenant colonel.

14:37.066 --> 14:38.648
He was over there as an advisor.

14:40.451 --> 14:44.537
But he was real nice, very, very nice.

14:45.074 --> 14:49.779
And today, I wish I had that signature of that stuffy side.

14:49.859 --> 14:50.480
I'll bet you do.

14:51.021 --> 14:52.442
All that was kept.

14:53.443 --> 14:54.344
I didn't get to keep it.

14:54.364 --> 14:56.286
You didn't get to keep any of that.

14:56.306 --> 15:03.494
Now, when you were over in the Pacific and New Guinea, your transport was by air, just exclusively pretty much, right?

15:03.514 --> 15:04.776
Exclusively by air, right.

15:04.796 --> 15:09.381
I think you told me one time you personally flew in a B-25, and that wasn't a whole lot of fun.

15:09.941 --> 15:15.047
Well, that was before the courier station, I believe, got into Holania.

15:15.449 --> 15:16.591
That's in the northern part.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.415
You know, the war was going forward.

15:23.060 --> 15:36.461
I got up to land here, and the only way that I could get back to, I think I was going to come back to that jam, I believe, was by, I got a ride in the B-25, I believe it was, in the back of the bubble up there.

15:36.481 --> 15:37.122
Yes.

15:37.142 --> 15:38.363
I didn't like that trip at all.

15:39.866 --> 15:41.568
That was a little bit too close to the action.

15:41.588 --> 15:43.431
What we had, what I had to do there,

15:43.934 --> 16:01.422
Before these courier stations were established, if something came in that had to go to some of the headquarters, I can't remember the names, atopi or some of those places, there were two officers at this place, seven other officers.

16:01.623 --> 16:04.728
One of us had to deliver that by playing to the other headquarters.

16:05.890 --> 16:09.756
And those planes were going back and forth all the time, of course.

16:10.512 --> 16:22.585
We're gonna come back to this fascinating story here in a minute, but I wanna go to some photographs that you supplied for us that sort of span your service a little bit, not a whole lot of photographs.

16:22.625 --> 16:29.332
And I think we're about ready to put one of them up and I want you to just sort of talk about these photographs, if you will.

16:30.113 --> 16:30.914
Here you go.

16:30.934 --> 16:34.598
I'm gonna adjust this so we can get the glare out just a little bit.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.579
Talk about this photograph.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.621
Now, this was at Fort Sill, is that correct?

16:38.442 --> 16:39.523
That's at Fort Sill.

16:39.588 --> 16:43.814
And that's just one of your Army buddies, and was this just during the training, or what was that?

16:43.834 --> 16:44.234
Right.

16:44.895 --> 16:45.456
I can see it.

16:45.476 --> 16:49.521
We were looking, just kind of laying over that 105 gun.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.282
Is that you on the right?

16:50.443 --> 16:55.810
Most of that training up there at Fort Shell as a second lieutenant was on the 105s.

16:56.991 --> 17:00.096
Now, that's you, the handsome soldier on the right.

17:00.136 --> 17:00.716
Is that correct?

17:00.757 --> 17:01.778
No, I'm on the left.

17:01.798 --> 17:03.220
Oh, you're the handsome soldier on the left.

17:03.240 --> 17:03.420
Yes, sir.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.923
I knew you were one of those handsome soldiers over there.

17:05.943 --> 17:08.547
I like that hat.

17:08.567 --> 17:09.308
Yeah, that was.

17:09.777 --> 17:12.380
That was, I guess that had kept you out of the sun a little bit.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.341
Is that right?

17:13.361 --> 17:14.463
Is that right?

17:14.483 --> 17:19.168
And, um, I was a 90 day wonder.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.132
I wonder how you finished it 90 days.

17:22.612 --> 17:22.933
Indeed.

17:23.653 --> 17:23.974
Indeed.

17:24.575 --> 17:27.458
We're going to put another picture up here as soon as we get it.

17:27.478 --> 17:28.820
This is a picture of you.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.082
I think that this next picture that's coming up and there it is.

17:31.443 --> 17:32.985
I believe that was taken at New Guinea.

17:33.085 --> 17:37.590
Talk a little bit about, uh, about that photograph with the, in front of the, the aircraft.

17:38.735 --> 17:42.560
A lot of those planes that came in had that little picture on there.

17:43.361 --> 17:43.821
Yeah, the nose art.

17:43.841 --> 17:46.625
That plane there, I think, was being repaired up at the engine.

17:46.885 --> 17:49.769
They changed the engines on some of those planes over there.

17:49.849 --> 17:51.391
That might have been what they were doing there.

17:51.451 --> 17:51.932
I don't know.

17:52.232 --> 17:52.492
Right.

17:52.993 --> 17:55.997
But that was at the airstrip where I was.

17:56.097 --> 18:00.402
And I went out the other day and had my picture taken.

18:00.442 --> 18:05.829
And that was an example of some of the transport that you would take in your business as a courier.

18:05.889 --> 18:06.430
Is that right?

18:06.511 --> 18:14.321
Well, I think that's a, I'm not sure what plane that is, but I, where the C-47s mostly for the transport planes.

18:14.341 --> 18:15.322
Right, right.

18:15.342 --> 18:17.104
They call it ATC at the time.

18:17.264 --> 18:17.865
Right, right.

18:17.885 --> 18:19.047
Air Transport Command.

18:19.547 --> 18:21.389
What do you remember about New Guinea, about the country?

18:21.510 --> 18:22.211
What was it like?

18:22.371 --> 18:29.560
Obviously the natives there were, it was during wartime, but it seemed like it was, was it a friendly place to the American soldier?

18:29.580 --> 18:29.960
Oh, yes.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.885
The Australians had complete control of the natives.

18:34.962 --> 18:38.105
The natives were jolly people.

18:38.145 --> 18:43.871
They all were, I think they died when they were young and had no medical care early.

18:45.693 --> 18:49.036
But the natives would have what they call a sing-sing.

18:49.056 --> 18:49.276
Yes.

18:50.097 --> 18:52.039
Maybe a big bunch of them would get around there.

18:52.059 --> 18:53.040
They'd jump up and down.

18:53.120 --> 19:01.809
And on that coral, the sole of their foot was about a couple of inches at least thick.

19:01.829 --> 19:04.632
And how they could walk on that sharp coral, I don't know.

19:05.337 --> 19:07.862
But they were all barefooted, of course.

19:08.623 --> 19:10.146
But they liked to have sing-sings.

19:11.388 --> 19:13.853
They'd get out there in a circle and jump up and down.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.375
Would you sing-sing with them?

19:16.357 --> 19:18.120
No, you wouldn't sing-sing with them.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.583
Got one more photograph I want to show.

19:19.603 --> 19:22.749
And this is actually a piece of art that I just want you to tell us about.

19:22.769 --> 19:24.432
And there it is.

19:24.452 --> 19:29.421
I'm going to try to adjust it just a little bit here to where we can get a good, pardon my hand there.

19:29.857 --> 19:30.898
Talk about this.

19:30.938 --> 19:31.759
An artist did this.

19:31.819 --> 19:36.704
Talk about the Bonner Edmonds Meteor and Tex Edmonds.

19:36.724 --> 19:43.671
Well, that drawing was made when I came back from overseas the second time.

19:43.711 --> 19:49.737
My fellow named Loughborough was also assigned there in San Francisco.

19:50.999 --> 19:57.265
He was assigned there, and he drew that picture of us, an old car that we bought.

19:58.088 --> 20:00.892
We had the dog as the mascot there at the office.

20:00.912 --> 20:07.301
There were about eight or ten other officers at this courier place in San Francisco.

20:08.462 --> 20:12.027
And that's where I spent a little time at the end of the war.

20:12.047 --> 20:13.209
I don't know if folks can read it.

20:13.269 --> 20:25.085
It says, the photo, the demon-driving pair of Jay Bonner, who is from Alabama, and Tex Edmonds, driving west onto California.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.948
On the way to the Fairmont Hotel.

20:27.620 --> 20:34.386
And you have actually the original.

20:34.406 --> 20:43.474
This is a photograph of the actual sketch, and you have that sketch at your home on a much larger scale and a place of honor in your home.

20:43.695 --> 20:45.296
Yeah, you're very proud of that.

20:45.456 --> 20:47.038
I sure am.

20:47.058 --> 20:52.403
Talk about you were given an emergency leave to come home.

20:53.584 --> 20:53.704
Right.

20:53.724 --> 20:55.045
And then...

20:56.020 --> 21:04.574
Talk about that and then it leading to you going back and very interesting story there when you came home and then had to go back again.

21:04.595 --> 21:09.343
Well, I had left New Guinea and went up to Taclobal in the Philippines.

21:10.545 --> 21:13.470
And then an emergency leave came in.

21:13.490 --> 21:17.877
My mother was back home dying of cancer.

21:18.768 --> 21:26.895
I came back to the States and was able to visit her a little bit before she died.

21:26.915 --> 21:28.817
And then I went back to San Francisco.

21:29.998 --> 21:34.082
And then I was assigned to a boat, a Liberty ship.

21:35.643 --> 21:43.650
And I found out later at that time, I had the invasion map of Japan.

21:44.811 --> 21:46.513
On that boat?

21:47.270 --> 21:49.713
I was the only Army officer on the ship.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.779
There were two sergeants, as I remember, on there.

21:53.799 --> 21:58.005
They were in charge of these trucks that were strapped down on the top.

21:58.025 --> 22:03.132
That's where I spent most of my nights sleeping on those trucks, a big seat.

22:04.514 --> 22:06.757
It was a very enjoyable trip back.

22:07.619 --> 22:11.404
It took about 30 days, as I remember, on that liberty ship.

22:12.329 --> 22:18.217
I got to eat in the mess hall with the captain, of course, and the crew.

22:18.237 --> 22:27.428
And the only time something happened that I didn't care for was the Japanese subs come up.

22:27.548 --> 22:32.315
And they shot two rounds at us, but both rounds went over.

22:33.776 --> 22:38.202
I might mention, too, while we were going over there, we saw a lot of several

22:39.025 --> 22:41.627
mines.

22:41.647 --> 22:49.454
They were about the size of five baby basketballs and they had prongs sticking out.

22:50.295 --> 22:52.917
And our crew tried to shoot them and all they had was rifles.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.098
They never did hit one.

22:54.798 --> 22:56.420
So the ship just probably went on.

22:56.460 --> 22:59.082
So those might be floating today.

22:59.142 --> 22:59.883
I don't know.

22:59.903 --> 23:05.027
It really gave you an idea of how dangerous this war was, especially for cruise ships in the Pacific.

23:05.768 --> 23:08.610
Because you got a taste of that as you were going back over with the

23:09.248 --> 23:11.251
the two shots at you from the submarines.

23:11.932 --> 23:24.051
But that's quite interesting, is that part of your cargo were the maps for what was supposed to be a ground invasion of Japan, which of course never came to be.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.875
Unfortunately, we never really have to use that.

23:26.895 --> 23:27.296
Indeed.

23:27.316 --> 23:36.370
And you've talked to me before about that, and you were one of the many veterans who believed that the decision by President Truman at the time to drop the bomb on Hiroshima

23:36.805 --> 23:39.249
While it took a lot of lives, it saved a lot of lives.

23:39.289 --> 23:40.291
And you're a big believer in it.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.595
It saved lives for the Japanese and the Americans.

23:42.615 --> 23:43.777
I'm sure it did.

23:43.797 --> 23:44.117
Indeed.

23:44.598 --> 23:45.319
Indeed.

23:45.339 --> 23:47.723
A lot of people feel the same way.

23:48.544 --> 23:58.361
I believe it was at about this time that you were, I guess you were trying to get where you were and there was bad weather and you got the services of a tugboat.

23:58.381 --> 23:59.843
Talk about how you did that.

24:00.295 --> 24:04.561
Well, when this ship came in, it anchored out there.

24:04.581 --> 24:08.206
I believe it was 50, I'm not sure.

24:08.226 --> 24:09.228
And there was a storm.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.654
One way or the other, I got in with the captain of the ship.

24:13.674 --> 24:16.639
They had a sailboat out for us.

24:16.659 --> 24:22.607
And I was able to go to the headquarters of the Army and be relieved of the material I had there.

24:24.210 --> 24:28.716
And then I went down to the harbor master to get us

24:28.949 --> 24:33.974
a boat to take me back out to the ship to get my gear off there.

24:33.994 --> 24:37.257
But he wouldn't do it because of the storm.

24:38.879 --> 24:42.963
So I went down and picked up and found a guy that had a tug.

24:44.545 --> 24:47.688
And I offered him two quarts of American whiskey.

24:50.331 --> 24:57.758
I had taken four of them over from the States from my friends over there.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.595
Well, I had four.

25:00.615 --> 25:03.778
But anyway, he went out there, took me out there on the ship.

25:03.918 --> 25:06.681
I didn't have any trouble getting on the ship.

25:07.442 --> 25:13.027
But then he went up there the first time and broke the ladder on the ship.

25:14.508 --> 25:15.989
And then he made a turn out there.

25:16.109 --> 25:21.154
He informed me that unless I got all that time, he was going back in.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.838
So I started to jump into the water.

25:26.476 --> 25:36.451
And an old sailor, thank goodness, he grabbed me by the hand arm and said, if you jump in there, that propeller or that tug will chew you to pieces.

25:36.551 --> 25:37.212
That's good advice.

25:37.252 --> 25:37.913
I was fortunate.

25:38.113 --> 25:41.599
The tug came up there, and I finally dropped on top.

25:41.619 --> 25:44.803
I got into the headquarters, 8th Army.

25:46.766 --> 25:52.635
Then I had orders to go with the 8th Army to set up a courier station in Yokohama.

25:52.919 --> 25:59.527
And I believe that was certainly, you were one of the first units actually in Japan after the war and set up that courier station in Japan.

25:59.547 --> 26:02.411
They didn't have any transportation up there at the time.

26:02.491 --> 26:08.077
And I was one of the first in there at that time.

26:08.998 --> 26:11.762
The Japanese people though were very cooperative.

26:11.902 --> 26:13.784
We could walk down the street at night.

26:14.405 --> 26:15.707
There was no problem.

26:15.727 --> 26:16.868
Right.

26:17.962 --> 26:22.247
I guess the people were just as relieved that the war was over as the Americans were.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.710
And I would say they were very hungry, too.

26:25.131 --> 26:26.292
Right.

26:26.873 --> 26:32.059
I remember one time they had a warehouse and they got a bunch of carrying goods out of there.

26:32.099 --> 26:34.482
They started distributing them down the street.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.265
Those people were getting them.

26:37.966 --> 26:40.349
And they didn't have Japanese language on there.

26:40.710 --> 26:41.090
Indeed.

26:41.290 --> 26:43.513
They'd been held in that warehouse all that time.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.648
Major Edmonds, we just have a little over a minute now.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.311
Real quickly, I know your wife, Eleanor, also served our country in Korea.

26:50.352 --> 26:52.133
Talk just a little bit about her service.

26:52.574 --> 26:58.040
Well, she went through basic training over at, I believe it was Lackland.

26:58.340 --> 26:59.041
Right.

26:59.061 --> 27:04.967
And then she went to, I believe, Maxwell Air Base in Alabama, I believe it is.

27:05.127 --> 27:05.768
Right.

27:05.788 --> 27:07.830
And that's where she spent most of her time.

27:08.131 --> 27:08.692
Indeed.

27:08.712 --> 27:12.938
And I know that both of you are very involved, too, in VFW activities.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.041
I think she has some confidential material there.

27:15.442 --> 27:17.084
She was in the headquarters there.

27:17.224 --> 27:17.885
I understand.

27:18.146 --> 27:18.486
Indeed.

27:19.127 --> 27:28.681
And both of you are very involved in the VFW here now and very proud of that and the work that you all do here locally with the VFW.

27:28.701 --> 27:29.502
I sure am.

27:29.522 --> 27:29.903
Indeed.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.556
Thank you very much for visiting with us.

27:31.716 --> 27:32.981
We're very proud of your service.

27:33.001 --> 27:37.680
I certainly do appreciate your service to the veterans in every respect.

27:37.901 --> 27:38.564
Thank you.

27:50.190 --> 27:53.155
Edmunds' role in our war effort was essential to victory.

27:53.175 --> 27:59.023
