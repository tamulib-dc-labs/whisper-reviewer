00:24.263 --> 00:48.498
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:48.899 --> 00:49.900
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:50.808 --> 00:58.660
Captain Gerald Roop is a proud Oakey who has lived in the Brazos Valley for the better part of 38 years, a sound officer in World War II.

00:59.161 --> 01:00.302
And what's a sound officer?

01:00.503 --> 01:16.427
Well, there's a good chance that like me, you don't know about sound and flash, but you will find out that his was not a large unit, but quite a valuable one that put itself deeply in harm's way through combat at the Battle of the Bulge and other resistance in their march through France and into Germany.

01:16.447 --> 01:19.431
Welcome Captain Gerald Roop to Veterans of the Valley.

01:19.698 --> 01:20.759
You grew up in Oklahoma.

01:20.799 --> 01:21.980
You are a proud Okie.

01:22.040 --> 01:28.606
You, Oklahoma class of 1942, and it didn't take long after graduation that you were in the service in January of 43.

01:29.287 --> 01:38.135
I want to get right into what is sound and flash, Captain Root, because a lot of people might not be familiar with this really sort of survey operation of World War II.

01:38.415 --> 01:39.296
What's sound and flash?

01:40.157 --> 01:47.764
Sound and flash, Tom, is the common name given to a field artillery observation battalion.

01:48.554 --> 01:55.062
There are two batteries, each made up of one sound platoon and one flash platoon.

01:55.963 --> 02:05.354
And just as the name implies, sound, actually the purpose of the unit is to locate enemy artillery.

02:05.374 --> 02:18.409
Sound basically means that you put six microphones out about a mile apart over a five mile area.

02:19.334 --> 02:24.020
Then you connect these to a machine in the command post.

02:24.902 --> 02:43.867
We have an operator out front who pushes a button when a shell goes over and it activates the machine and prints out on tape the time that each microphone received the burst.

02:44.788 --> 02:46.050
Amazing.

02:46.334 --> 03:03.607
Since these are plotted by survey on a plotting board, you can figure the difference in time that each shell hit the microphone and back plot to locate the source of the sound or the gun.

03:04.308 --> 03:05.811
And if you get enough of these...

03:06.162 --> 03:14.021
over a period of time, then you'll know that you have a good plot and the information is given to the Corps.

03:14.742 --> 03:15.684
We were Corps troops.

03:16.346 --> 03:20.155
And then they would fire and try to

03:21.637 --> 03:22.959
eliminate the gun.

03:23.159 --> 03:23.619
Exactly.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.081
Basically, that's it.

03:25.101 --> 03:26.923
This was really high-tech for this time.

03:26.943 --> 03:31.669
I mean, it sounds high-tech to me right now, but this was high-tech for this time, extremely, wasn't it?

03:31.729 --> 03:33.071
Very much so.

03:33.091 --> 03:36.575
Of course, it's pretty primitive now, considering the way things are done.

03:36.755 --> 03:41.921
Now, 1,600 yards apart, the reason for that, because that had to do with the speed of sound between the microphones, is that right?

03:41.942 --> 03:42.362
Approximately.

03:42.764 --> 03:51.051
You put them four sound seconds apart, and sound generally travels around 400 yards per second, depending on a lot of factors.

03:51.071 --> 03:54.434
But you spread them far enough that you could cover a wide area.

03:55.035 --> 04:11.809
But they had to be as far forward as you could put them, which put the survey crews that put in the Mikes in danger, because they were quite out a lot of times in the open, and the OPs, the outposts, were up with the infantry outpost, so Mike

04:12.616 --> 04:22.188
Command post had to, of course, be as far forward as it could be because you had to run a line from each microphone back to the CP.

04:22.208 --> 04:27.195
So it was a little bit of an arduous situation.

04:27.215 --> 04:27.595
Exactly.

04:27.775 --> 04:30.479
Now, that was sound, and that was your specialty as a sound officer.

04:30.499 --> 04:31.660
But explain what flash was.

04:31.680 --> 04:31.901
All right.

04:32.221 --> 04:34.003
Flash is just as the word says.

04:34.704 --> 04:39.290
You set up two optical instruments at a certain distance part.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.952
You measure the distance between them.

04:41.708 --> 04:46.833
generally in a church steeple or a high building or someplace where they can see.

04:47.714 --> 04:52.760
And most of it was done at night, although they could see flashes during the daytime.

04:52.780 --> 05:09.758
Both OPs would zero in on a flash, and by trigonometry, since you knew the distance between the two and the angles, you had the angle at the apex, so you could locate the source of the gun.

05:10.042 --> 05:13.371
So all those students taking trigonometry and wondering, what are we taking this for?

05:13.792 --> 05:17.642
It certainly came in handy as far as this particular operation in World War II.

05:17.783 --> 05:18.324
Exactly.

05:18.344 --> 05:18.484
Right.

05:18.745 --> 05:20.049
OP, of course, that's your outpost.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.793
CP, that's your command post.

05:22.214 --> 05:22.836
Command post.

05:23.423 --> 05:33.579
I want to move on because you went on to Camp Gordon, Georgia, and you started this new Sound and Flash unit in 1944, went overseas in September of 1944.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.525
Let's talk about that because you landed at Omaha Beach.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.489
This was about three months after, of course, D-Day.

05:40.509 --> 05:44.776
But sort of talk about what Omaha Beach and Normandy was like three months later.

05:44.796 --> 05:45.116
All right.

05:45.457 --> 05:49.583
Initially, we landed at Liverpool, took a train to Southampton,

05:49.563 --> 05:53.630
and got on a boat and went directly across the channel to Omaha Beach.

05:54.251 --> 06:01.342
There wasn't anything there except the wrecked buildings, the concrete gun emplacements the Germans had had.

06:01.522 --> 06:08.594
I never asked the colonel why, but I think he wanted the honor of maybe landing on Omaha Beach.

06:09.195 --> 06:10.397
But we did.

06:10.637 --> 06:16.887
And I thought, gee, they must need us pretty bad because here we are a week after we landed,

06:17.542 --> 06:18.623
back in France.

06:18.903 --> 06:22.366
Well, we sat there for six weeks waiting for our equipment to arrive.

06:22.386 --> 06:25.088
Right there at the Cherbourg Peninsula, waiting for the equipment.

06:25.128 --> 06:27.450
So you sort of cooled your heels there for a while, right?

06:27.550 --> 06:28.972
In the mud and the rain, yes.

06:29.032 --> 06:35.217
Late October of 1944, though, you were in combat, and we're talking about the wintertime, and we start talking about the Battle of the Bulge.

06:35.697 --> 06:40.862
The people I have visited with that were involved in the Battle of the Bulge, the first thing they talk about is the weather, the bitter, bitter cold.

06:41.302 --> 06:43.204
Talk about your memories of that.

06:43.924 --> 06:47.127
Well, the cold weather really didn't start until

06:47.663 --> 06:52.430
About the time of the bulge, about the 16th of December to be exact.

06:52.951 --> 06:58.921
But during that time, we had moved, the army had moved up to the edge of Germany.

06:59.341 --> 07:00.944
And of course, everybody was optimistic.

07:00.984 --> 07:03.287
You know, we're going to be in Berlin by Christmas.

07:03.668 --> 07:04.930
Well, it didn't work that way.

07:05.213 --> 07:08.678
The Germans and the weather turned out to be a key factor.

07:09.239 --> 07:15.428
So it snowed and got cold and was miserable.

07:16.790 --> 07:21.817
It was the coldest winter of the century, winter of 44, 45.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.722
And we had problems with frostbite.

07:25.483 --> 07:33.094
Of course, you lived out in dugouts when we were in the Hurtigan Forest, east of Aachen.

07:33.513 --> 07:37.118
So it was all in all not a very pleasant experience at that time.

07:37.819 --> 07:45.669
And your units during some of this time were taking resistance, taking fire, and you were not a combat troop though.

07:45.949 --> 07:47.031
No.

07:47.091 --> 07:51.056
We were non-combat troops in a combat zone.

07:51.136 --> 07:51.997
Exactly.

07:52.017 --> 07:59.166
I used to wonder why I was never visited by some of the battalion people, but they were smart enough to stay back where they were.

07:59.226 --> 08:01.950
But we got a lot of artillery incoming,

08:02.268 --> 08:13.324
during that period after the bulge and until actually around the first part of February when they crossed the Roar River and moved on east.

08:13.344 --> 08:13.925
Right.

08:13.945 --> 08:18.652
But your job was to place these microphones really out in front of the front, exactly.

08:18.752 --> 08:23.479
So you were indeed in the front.

08:23.499 --> 08:26.543
This must have been a rather harrowing ordeal from time to time.

08:26.623 --> 08:31.971
Well, it's the survey crews and the communications people that really caught the brunt of it.

08:32.153 --> 08:44.678
We lost a number of survey men and the communications people, the wire men, had to replace the wire and the microphone because GIs would see those mics and all they had warning signs on them.

08:45.012 --> 08:47.014
no telling what they do to them.

08:47.195 --> 08:47.395
Right.

08:47.655 --> 08:52.040
You got orders to move on to the Elbe River, the Battle of the Bulge here, early 1945.

08:52.120 --> 08:59.129
The bulge was actually over, but your battalion was ordered to the Elbe, and it was something like a 200-mile march.

08:59.149 --> 08:59.609
Is that right?

08:59.990 --> 09:02.112
This was after we had crossed the Rhine.

09:02.132 --> 09:02.953
Right.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.878
About the middle of April, thereabouts.

09:07.499 --> 09:07.779
Yes.

09:08.480 --> 09:13.686
We were sitting after the Battle of the Ruhr,

09:14.273 --> 09:20.199
where so many hundred thousand Germans were captured, we figured the war was about over.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.001
And we didn't have anything to do.

09:22.021 --> 09:24.103
We had a base out, but there wasn't any ranging.

09:24.644 --> 09:28.808
So we figured we were done, you know, sitting there fat, dumb and happy.

09:29.529 --> 09:32.692
Lots of German beer and good food.

09:33.693 --> 09:36.696
Then we got orders to move to the Elbe River.

09:37.717 --> 09:39.399
They pronounce it Elbe, I think.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.762
I don't know why we did, but...

09:43.062 --> 09:46.428
We did a 200-mile march in one day.

09:46.448 --> 09:47.510
We moved by batteries.

09:48.511 --> 09:57.246
And during the march, I was a little bit skeptical because the infantry had not moved nearly that far.

09:57.326 --> 09:59.229
They were still involved in the Ruhr Valley.

10:00.091 --> 10:04.378
Now, about this time, the Americans had met the Russians

10:05.152 --> 10:13.643
down the town was Tobar or Tolgar or something, down below Magdeburg on the Elb River.

10:14.064 --> 10:16.887
That was about the 25th of April.

10:17.568 --> 10:19.150
But we were fired.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.994
We went on our march.

10:22.014 --> 10:26.680
We ran through several groups of Germans and got fired on.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.083
In fact, they tore up one truck and killed

10:29.452 --> 10:32.000
the officer and several enlisted men in the truck.

10:32.822 --> 10:36.353
And at that point, I began to wonder why we were where we were.

10:36.915 --> 10:41.067
But we've been told to go, so when you're in the Army, you go where they tell you to.

10:41.228 --> 10:41.689
Right, right.

10:41.872 --> 10:45.157
The Germans at this time were sort of in a mode of surrender.

10:45.237 --> 10:47.400
They felt that the war was coming to an end.

10:47.420 --> 11:00.500
You didn't know exactly what the mode of the war was for the Russians, so you were all sort of playing the game there, finding out what the Russians were doing, and you thought that your movement to the Elbe River may have something to do with monitoring Russian artillery operations.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.081
Is that right?

11:01.882 --> 11:07.390
When we got to the Elbe about the 25th of April,

11:07.606 --> 11:11.396
The Germans had just started to surrender.

11:12.819 --> 11:15.426
The Elbe at that point is about 40 miles west of Berlin.

11:15.907 --> 11:20.699
And the Russians had just gotten into Berlin and were devastating it.

11:20.719 --> 11:21.902
So the big...

11:22.287 --> 11:28.437
march of Germans trying to surrender came out after we got there to the Elbe.

11:29.198 --> 11:38.172
So, yeah, I think they put us there because they were a little concerned that maybe the Russians... See, we had been given orders not to cross the Elbe.

11:38.192 --> 11:38.513
Yes, sir.

11:38.933 --> 11:39.654
From Eisenhower.

11:39.674 --> 11:40.376
From Eisenhower.

11:40.396 --> 11:40.976
Right.

11:40.996 --> 11:47.807
So they were concerned that maybe the Russians would come into that area, and who knew what they would do?

11:48.088 --> 11:48.328
Right.

11:48.781 --> 11:55.197
So we were up there to range on Russian artillery in case they began to move towards the Elbe River.

11:55.438 --> 11:55.638
Right.

11:55.999 --> 11:59.688
There's a couple of stories that you told me that I want to make sure that we tell.

11:59.708 --> 12:05.102
We may not be operating in the right order here, but talk about the...

12:05.470 --> 12:13.401
When you went and the train full of POWs that you sort of escorted back, that was quite a sight that you'll never forget.

12:13.421 --> 12:17.026
There were three train cars, I believe, full of German POWs?

12:17.687 --> 12:19.990
This was while we were still at Cherbourg Peninsula.

12:20.090 --> 12:20.351
Right.

12:20.411 --> 12:29.323
They sent me and another officer and several enlisted men up into Belgium to pick up a train load of German POWs.

12:29.423 --> 12:29.644
Right.

12:30.064 --> 12:34.330
And we ended up hauling 50 freight cars full of

12:34.934 --> 12:40.400
Germans, 50 to a car, back to the Cherbourg area.

12:40.420 --> 12:45.025
So that was... That was something that you'll never forget.

12:45.966 --> 12:46.887
But they did get back.

12:46.927 --> 12:48.969
They were prisoners, but they did get back.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.991
December the 16th, you mentioned that date.

12:51.031 --> 12:56.597
You also mentioned that that's sort of a special date because in your mind, three historical things happened on that date.

12:56.677 --> 12:56.878
They did.

12:56.898 --> 12:57.298
What were they?

12:57.758 --> 13:00.682
The first was that the Battle of the Bulge started.

13:00.702 --> 13:00.962
Right.

13:01.623 --> 13:04.806
Second was General Eisenhower got his fifth star.

13:05.090 --> 13:07.202
And third, I was promoted to first lieutenant.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.544
All that happened on December the 16th.

13:09.805 --> 13:13.110
I wasn't on the same orders with General Eisenhower, obviously.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.413
You can find two of those three things in history books, right?

13:15.513 --> 13:15.714
Right.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.997
In your own history, you remember that.

13:18.017 --> 13:22.063
There was an outcome to what you all did as far from sound operation.

13:22.083 --> 13:26.890
And the outcome, I believe you said, was some 65 enemy gun positions were located.

13:26.930 --> 13:30.496
That was our initial location in the Hurtgen Forest.

13:30.596 --> 13:31.136
Right.

13:31.517 --> 13:33.740
We were there for about six weeks.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.885
And during the winter, the worst part of it,

13:36.865 --> 13:46.724
And they told us later, Corps did, that we had located and they had gotten rid of some 65 German gun positions.

13:46.804 --> 13:47.345
Right.

13:47.365 --> 13:58.286
Now I want to go ahead and fast forward back to the Elbe River because when you were here and setting up your command post, you were able to set up a command post that was a little bit more luxurious than the command post that you had seen.

13:58.426 --> 13:59.228
It was a

13:59.208 --> 14:02.292
three-story hunting lodge that belonged to a German baron.

14:02.732 --> 14:05.716
Sort of described this place and sort of the luxury of this place.

14:05.756 --> 14:08.139
It wasn't a bad place to be, and the baron wasn't a bad guy.

14:08.439 --> 14:09.521
He was a nice fellow.

14:09.541 --> 14:10.662
Yes, sir.

14:11.263 --> 14:14.327
It was the finest of any CPs we had the whole time.

14:14.527 --> 14:14.747
Right.

14:14.867 --> 14:19.413
He had been a lieutenant colonel in the German army and was wounded.

14:19.453 --> 14:20.694
Baron Itzenplitz, I believe.

14:20.714 --> 14:21.135
Itzenplitz.

14:21.195 --> 14:21.776
Right.

14:21.796 --> 14:23.257
And was wounded and retired.

14:24.239 --> 14:28.624
His house in Berlin had been destroyed, so they had moved out to this

14:28.908 --> 14:32.596
three-story hunting lodge, which we have a picture of.

14:33.078 --> 14:33.659
Coming up later.

14:33.859 --> 14:34.120
Right.

14:34.521 --> 14:38.029
But as soon as, it was about a half a mile from the Elbe River.

14:38.049 --> 14:43.903
And as soon as I saw it, I told my master sergeant, I said, we're going to end the war right here in luxury.

14:44.404 --> 14:47.170
So he and I went in and talked to the colonel.

14:47.622 --> 14:49.004
He had his family was there.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.606
He had three children, I believe.

14:50.726 --> 14:51.387
Yes, sir.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.630
And he was glad to see us, really.

14:53.651 --> 14:54.151
Right.

14:54.171 --> 14:55.032
We weren't the Russians.

14:56.334 --> 15:00.700
But he moved out to his servant's quarters.

15:00.721 --> 15:00.961
Right.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.104
And gave us the house.

15:03.124 --> 15:05.327
And so we stayed there until...

15:06.185 --> 15:09.729
the war was over and we moved on back into the battalion area.

15:09.749 --> 15:14.835
Before we go to the pictures of some of the artifacts from the war that you brought along with you, I want you to tell one more story.

15:14.895 --> 15:21.482
When you were there, you were just sort of trying to while away your time and you and your buck sergeant, a fellow named Dusty Rhodes, decided to take a little trip.

15:21.502 --> 15:22.864
Talk about what happened on that trip.

15:23.404 --> 15:27.489
Well, I don't know whether I'm proud of it or not, but we did it.

15:28.430 --> 15:34.977
But Dusty and I were up at the river one day and Germans were coming across and my platoon was

15:35.260 --> 15:39.847
unhappy because they hadn't gotten any pistols, any Lugers.

15:39.867 --> 15:48.540
So I told Dusty, I said, let's take one of these rubber boats these Germans come across with and go on across the river and see what we can find.

15:48.560 --> 15:58.415
So just as we got to the other side, the river was about 50 yards wide there, a little car pulled up and four German officers got out.

15:58.436 --> 16:00.879
And I said something like, are you through with your car?

16:01.721 --> 16:03.343
And one of them said,

16:03.965 --> 16:06.127
It sure is glad to hear English again.

16:06.828 --> 16:09.210
He told me he was a doctor, an M.D.

16:09.770 --> 16:18.678
from Brooklyn who had gone back to Germany apparently early in the war and got stuck there and spent the whole time in the war.

16:18.718 --> 16:20.460
That was his story.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.604
I should have gotten his name, but they were in a hurry to go on west.

16:24.624 --> 16:29.868
So we got in the car, turned it around and headed east and leisurely driving along.

16:29.908 --> 16:30.849
It was a nice day.

16:31.029 --> 16:32.751
Nothing happening.

16:32.991 --> 16:33.972
Nobody around.

16:34.306 --> 16:38.872
And Dusty said, Lieutenant, we're not going to clear to Berlin, are we?

16:39.594 --> 16:41.997
And I said, I don't think so.

16:42.017 --> 16:43.960
We'd driven maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

16:44.420 --> 17:00.283
And about that time, here comes three great big German trucks, enormous, with steak bodies full of German soldiers, probably 50 in each truck, just jammed in, you know, to get away.

17:00.303 --> 17:03.908
So I got out, stopped the car, and got out and held my hand up.

17:04.343 --> 17:05.706
and said, halt.

17:05.726 --> 17:12.839
I said, throw all of your weapons over here on the side and go on up to the river and surrender.

17:12.860 --> 17:16.487
And I guess we were the first GIs these fellows had seen.

17:17.509 --> 17:19.873
So not a peep out of any of them.

17:19.893 --> 17:24.462
They threw the guns over and belts and took off.

17:24.998 --> 17:29.584
So we hung the pistols on the belts and turned the car around and went back to the river.

17:29.604 --> 17:33.849
You said you counted some 175 pistols that you got out of that.

17:34.069 --> 17:39.896
So what did you think when you got out of your car and held your hand up to these three trucks full?

17:39.916 --> 17:41.278
I mean, the war was still going on.

17:41.498 --> 17:42.019
Oh, I know it.

17:43.761 --> 17:44.983
It worked out good, didn't it?

17:46.344 --> 17:52.412
I'm really not honored to have been there, but it was a dubious distinction maybe.

17:52.552 --> 17:52.953
That's right.

17:52.993 --> 17:54.955
And you think that because of that, even though...

17:55.373 --> 18:06.119
you didn't know whether you were supposed to have been on the other side of the river, that quite possibly you and Sergeant Rhodes may have gotten the closest to Berlin of anybody in the war on the ground, right?

18:06.139 --> 18:06.700
On the ground.

18:07.102 --> 18:13.128
I didn't publicize what I had done because we had orders not to cross the L. Exactly.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.650
But you weren't in a combat boat.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.271
We weren't attacking anybody.

18:16.331 --> 18:16.892
Right, right.

18:16.912 --> 18:20.656
Let's go to some photographs, and then we've got some artifacts here that you brought back from the war.

18:20.676 --> 18:26.202
Let's go to a few photographs that Captain Roop, here you are.

18:27.123 --> 18:32.468
You can look right over there on that monitor right there, and you can tell us about where are you there.

18:32.448 --> 18:38.999
Well, that was somewhere in Germany, Tom, but I'm not sure it was where I had a CP command post.

18:39.400 --> 18:39.921
Right.

18:39.941 --> 18:43.587
And it must have been in the spring because I didn't have many heavy jackets on.

18:43.767 --> 18:44.228
Exactly.

18:44.408 --> 18:47.413
Okay, let's move on to the next photograph.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.020
Now, here's the hunting lodge.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.823
That's the Barron's hunting lodge.

18:52.843 --> 18:56.008
And your command post, I think you said, what, second floor of the right three windows?

18:56.242 --> 19:20.663
well the command post was all the second floor all the second floor and uh we it was large enough that uh the whole platoon lived in there exactly lived in and the third floor was a big ballroom yes sir that they had stored a lot of stuff in right no damage whatsoever it was a beautiful place probably built back in the middle 1800s we've got a picture coming up of the uh

19:20.845 --> 19:21.466
of the Baron.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.348
There he is.

19:22.368 --> 19:24.051
There's Baron Itzenplitz.

19:24.091 --> 19:27.417
That's him wearing the uniform that we're going to see here.

19:27.437 --> 19:28.840
We're going to see this uniform.

19:28.860 --> 19:32.025
We're going to get a close-up of this uniform that you're seeing right here.

19:32.426 --> 19:35.772
We have in the studio today and the hat and the belt.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.774
Everything but the pants.

19:36.854 --> 19:38.197
I wonder what happened to the pants.

19:38.217 --> 19:39.018
They got lost.

19:39.239 --> 19:40.581
And the boots, as a matter of fact.

19:40.601 --> 19:41.763
We have those in the studio.

19:41.803 --> 19:42.024
Right.

19:42.905 --> 19:43.246
Okay.

19:44.308 --> 19:44.929
Quite a distinct...

19:45.179 --> 19:46.000
Talk about this.

19:46.060 --> 19:54.007
I think people, anybody that saw the movie The Longest Day and remember the character that was played by Red Buttons, I believe, in that movie will remember this scene.

19:54.107 --> 19:56.429
This is actually what it looks like today, I guess.

19:56.469 --> 19:57.610
What is that?

19:57.930 --> 20:04.516
Three years ago, my two sons and I went back to France and spent a week on the Normandy Peninsula.

20:05.036 --> 20:07.158
And this church is in St.

20:07.178 --> 20:11.322
Mary Glees, which is the nearest little town to Omaha Beach.

20:11.382 --> 20:13.684
And it was the first town that was

20:14.238 --> 20:39.857
gotten to by the gis right uh this is an effigy that they keep hanging there to uh commemorate the d-day right uh parachute drum right and that was depicted in that movie uh that's well a part by red button so i believe just passed away this last year the actor did played a part in that movie that's pretty fascinating okay let's uh move on i think we've got a couple of others

20:40.293 --> 20:42.896
These are German POWs that are surrendering.

20:42.916 --> 20:43.877
Where is this one taken?

20:43.897 --> 20:49.404
This is at the Elbe, where I had my CP close by.

20:49.784 --> 20:51.246
The bridge had been blown, of course.

20:51.726 --> 20:57.012
So they used rubber boats and anything they could find to get on across.

20:57.613 --> 21:05.322
In a 10-day period there, they said that something like a million Germans surrendered, getting away from the Russians.

21:06.905 --> 21:13.375
Okay, I think we've got, and here is your unit, and you are sitting in the middle center.

21:13.876 --> 21:24.913
That's my sound platoon, made up of the survey people and the communications people and the CP personnel, command post personnel.

21:25.163 --> 21:26.184
Wasn't a very large unit.

21:26.204 --> 21:27.725
That was the A unit, right?

21:28.006 --> 21:28.746
That was A battery.

21:28.826 --> 21:29.287
A battery.

21:29.767 --> 21:30.127
Sound.

21:30.528 --> 21:31.068
Right.

21:31.088 --> 21:31.489
Yes.

21:31.509 --> 21:31.729
Right.

21:32.149 --> 21:32.990
Fascinating pictures.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.631
And we have some fascinating things.

21:34.651 --> 21:36.653
We talked about the uniform.

21:36.673 --> 21:40.316
And as a matter of fact, the uniform is right here to the side of you.

21:40.336 --> 21:43.900
We're going to go ahead and take a closer look at that and sort of describe what we're looking at.

21:43.940 --> 21:45.321
This is the Baron's uniform.

21:46.422 --> 21:50.646
How did it come by that he just handed it over to you?

21:51.086 --> 21:54.529
I think he was so glad to see us that we hadn't.

21:55.015 --> 21:57.746
destroyed anything of his.

21:57.766 --> 22:05.599
And I think he also felt that he ultimately would end up in the Russian zone, which he did.

22:05.967 --> 22:11.115
It had been petitioned, but it hadn't been announced that this area he was in would be in the right.

22:11.375 --> 22:15.602
So maybe he just wanted to save it or see that somebody got it that would treasure it.

22:15.842 --> 22:16.082
Right.

22:17.765 --> 22:18.967
So that's briefly it.

22:18.987 --> 22:22.592
That's obviously a piece of history that you have that you treasure.

22:23.614 --> 22:25.717
Let's move on what I'm holding up here.

22:25.797 --> 22:27.920
Talk about this helmet.

22:27.940 --> 22:31.165
And you can see right now the detail, the intricacy here.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.070
of what we're showing here.

22:33.130 --> 22:34.812
Talk about this helmet.

22:34.912 --> 22:36.454
The Baron gave you this, right?

22:36.474 --> 22:36.714
Yes.

22:37.395 --> 22:49.150
That's the spike helmet that German officers wore up through and including World War I. Now, I presume this had belonged to someone in his family because he had it.

22:49.170 --> 22:51.433
And that's the old.

22:51.453 --> 22:55.077
That was made.

22:56.103 --> 22:56.944
Turn it around.

22:57.224 --> 23:01.509
It says inside that it was made in September of 1909.

23:01.529 --> 23:02.390
Wow.

23:03.471 --> 23:05.112
That was the date of manufacture.

23:07.735 --> 23:08.796
Wow, that is incredible.

23:09.397 --> 23:11.679
I've got to hold up a couple other things.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.422
You just keep these things in your home, is that right?

23:15.063 --> 23:16.765
I've given them all to my son.

23:16.985 --> 23:17.325
I see.

23:17.365 --> 23:18.326
But he keeps them, yes.

23:18.406 --> 23:19.427
Yeah, I see.

23:19.908 --> 23:22.971
You can take that off of that if you want to.

23:23.508 --> 23:27.755
What we're about to get a close-up on here is a German Luger.

23:29.177 --> 23:31.000
Here we go.

23:31.882 --> 23:33.184
Now, this didn't come from the Baron.

23:33.344 --> 23:35.868
Tell me how you came by this.

23:35.888 --> 23:45.103
That was on a German lieutenant colonel up on the Elbe River one day who was standing there directing his troops across.

23:46.025 --> 23:50.612
And I didn't have a good Luger, and I figured that might be good, so he gave it to me.

23:52.482 --> 23:53.984
after I had asked him for it.

23:54.284 --> 23:56.227
This is quite a piece.

23:56.528 --> 24:00.052
How long were you overseas altogether?

24:01.274 --> 24:02.175
Almost a year.

24:04.118 --> 24:07.482
I'm going to reach over here and got some other things.

24:08.083 --> 24:14.913
This is a helmet, another item that was given to you by the Baron.

24:16.034 --> 24:19.258
We're going to get focused in on this, and here we go.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.882
There's a close-up of the...

24:22.233 --> 24:24.976
the swastika on the side of it, and we will pan out.

24:26.557 --> 24:27.418
Talk about this helmet.

24:27.438 --> 24:28.198
He gave this to you.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.299
This belonged to him, I guess?

24:29.800 --> 24:33.663
I don't know, but that's where it was, yes.

24:36.666 --> 24:40.490
People see these in movies and documentaries about World War II.

24:41.190 --> 24:47.516
I just find it incredible that I'm actually holding one.

24:47.596 --> 24:51.700
On the other side, there's another insignia here.

24:52.051 --> 24:54.194
I'm going to go ahead and move here into the shot.

24:54.894 --> 24:59.780
And here we have another chance as I'm putting these up.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.845
This is a... I'm going to let you sort of describe this.

25:03.885 --> 25:05.047
What am I holding here?

25:05.207 --> 25:08.671
It's an SS dress dagger.

25:08.691 --> 25:10.253
The SS troops used them.

25:11.114 --> 25:12.476
I don't have the scabbard for it.

25:12.536 --> 25:16.982
I never did, but it was part of a dress uniform.

25:17.462 --> 25:20.846
Right.

25:20.866 --> 25:21.467
Incredible.

25:21.734 --> 25:27.370
And I can't read the German, but there is a... You know what it says here on the blade?

25:27.711 --> 25:30.299
I'm not sure exactly.

25:30.319 --> 25:31.402
I'll hand it over to you.

25:31.763 --> 25:32.927
Everything for Germany.

25:32.947 --> 25:33.749
Everything for Germany.

25:33.970 --> 25:35.153
Alles für Deutschland.

25:35.521 --> 25:38.686
All for Germany.

25:38.706 --> 25:38.946
Right.

25:38.966 --> 25:43.513
This eagle on the handle has a small swastika there.

25:44.915 --> 25:49.182
One other item that folks will definitely recognize.

25:49.262 --> 25:51.545
I guess this was given to you by the Baron.

25:51.565 --> 25:57.234
This is an authentic Nazi armband.

25:57.254 --> 25:57.394
Mm-hmm.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.678
And the Baron gave you this, is that right?

26:02.319 --> 26:04.804
So this is the one that he wore.

26:04.824 --> 26:05.265
Could be.

26:05.365 --> 26:05.626
Yep.

26:08.692 --> 26:08.932
Wow.

26:12.058 --> 26:13.982
When you think about the war and you think about

26:14.553 --> 26:19.002
Hitler and what he stood for and what we were fighting against and all that.

26:19.022 --> 26:24.894
You look at these as just artifacts of sort of the memory of the victory of the allies.

26:25.054 --> 26:34.553
And when you personally look at these things and look at what they represent and the other side, what are sort of the thoughts that come to mind as a person who fought the war?

26:35.461 --> 26:40.248
Well, now it's been so long I can do it dispassionately.

26:40.268 --> 26:59.033
But for a long time, I was wrapped up in the emotions of the whole thing because it's an experience that once you go through, and mine was not nearly as bad as a lot of people because I lived through it.

26:59.093 --> 26:59.434
Yes, sir.

26:59.834 --> 27:00.996
It's something that...

27:02.107 --> 27:03.048
that's with you.

27:03.068 --> 27:03.609
Absolutely.

27:03.789 --> 27:04.871
Absolutely.

27:04.911 --> 27:08.977
Thank you very much for being with us, for bringing these items.

27:09.037 --> 27:10.760
It's just absolutely incredible.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.705
Of course, I know that you're very proud of your family.

27:14.746 --> 27:19.232
You have two sons, another son who sadly passed away a few years ago.

27:19.633 --> 27:27.584
You lost your wife, Louise, in 1998, but you have eight grandchildren that I know that you're very, very proud of and very, very proud in your retirement.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.088
And I thank you very, very much for being with us and mainly

27:30.068 --> 27:32.232
Thank you for your service, Captain Roop.

27:32.252 --> 27:33.134
You're entirely welcome.

27:33.254 --> 27:33.895
I appreciate it.

27:33.955 --> 27:34.316
Thank you.

27:34.837 --> 27:46.719
There were so many elements of World War II that if you were not familiar with Sound and Flash and how it helped the Allies win the war, well, now you know from a soldier who did his dangerous duty and came home to tell the story.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.524
We salute Captain Gerald Roop and all veterans.

27:50.045 --> 27:50.987
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:51.027 --> 27:53.612
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
