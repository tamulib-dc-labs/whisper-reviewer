00:01.617 --> 00:05.907
December 7, 1941.

00:08.092 --> 00:11.841
A date which will live in infamy.

00:12.322 --> 00:17.113
Later on this broadcast, bringing this important button from the United Press.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.135
Slash, Washington.

00:18.155 --> 00:18.917
No White House, but now just Japanese.

00:31.317 --> 00:32.899
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.401
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:35.462 --> 00:42.671
Leroy Balmain was in boot camp at Catalina Island when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945.

00:43.993 --> 00:55.587
As a merchant marine and later in the Air Force, he did not see combat duty, but served his country first as a fireman aboard the SS Alfred C. True, and then eventually as an administrative supervisor.

00:56.073 --> 01:14.589
He and his wife, Marita, were married in 1946, and his assignments took them from Alaska to Topeka, to Alabama, to Washington, D.C., to Shreveport, to the Philippines, and finally back to the States, and in 1972 to Bryan, where he served four years as an Air Force recruiter.

01:14.609 --> 01:20.895
After he retired from the service, he spent 19 years as executive director for the Better Business Bureau here.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.578
So you see, his entire adult life has been one of service.

01:25.064 --> 01:28.609
So please welcome Leroy Balmain to Veterans of the Valley.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.512
Leroy, thank you for being here.

01:30.552 --> 01:31.814
Thank you first for your service.

01:32.215 --> 01:35.519
I appreciate your service and your long duty in the Air Force.

01:35.580 --> 01:41.068
I know it was an interesting time, an interesting time in your life, and obviously one that you're proud of, right?

01:41.528 --> 01:49.961
I am most proud of the service that I have given to our country and to our local community.

01:50.181 --> 01:50.682
Exactly.

01:51.543 --> 01:54.227
It gives you a good, warm feeling, you know,

01:54.764 --> 01:57.107
to do something like that.

01:57.127 --> 01:57.747
Right, right.

01:57.767 --> 02:05.677
Well, you know, that's kids growing up and then graduating from high school in the 40s and around the war and all and that, that's what they did.

02:05.697 --> 02:08.981
There was an era of patriotism that went through everybody back then.

02:09.001 --> 02:17.110
Many of my friends, that's what caused me to want to go into the military as young as I was.

02:17.444 --> 02:26.195
Everybody else was going, and I thought I needed to go and help do what I could do.

02:26.916 --> 02:27.277
Indeed.

02:27.297 --> 02:31.582
And that's the reason why I went in at the age of 17 then.

02:31.602 --> 02:34.586
In 1945, and you entered the Merchant Marines.

02:34.646 --> 02:39.312
I believe you might be the first veteran that I've had on that I know of that was in the Merchant Marines.

02:39.813 --> 02:43.177
Talk about that and why you went that route initially.

02:43.197 --> 02:46.962
Okay, I wanted to go into the service, but my parents were not.

02:47.195 --> 02:50.158
sign the papers for me to go.

02:50.839 --> 03:05.115
So I finally came up with the Merchant Marines and they were convinced then that they would go ahead and sign the papers and I entered the Merchant Marines.

03:05.355 --> 03:05.675
Indeed.

03:06.296 --> 03:10.941
And like I said in the beginning you were at Catalina Island in boot camp actually when

03:11.326 --> 03:14.930
when the hostilities ended with the dropping of the bomb in August of 1945.

03:15.090 --> 03:19.495
So that kind of, I guess, changed your direction as far as what you were going to be doing.

03:19.775 --> 03:29.706
Well, yes, I was already obligated to serve in the Merchant Marines when the bomb was dropped.

03:29.766 --> 03:35.453
So I was at Catalina Island receiving my boot training.

03:35.573 --> 03:40.438
And from there, I left and went to

03:40.773 --> 03:42.015
Japan.

03:43.196 --> 04:05.066
The ship that I was on left San Pedro, California and went down through the Panama Canal up to New Orleans and we loaded the ship with supplies that the military would need over there.

04:05.387 --> 04:09.312
Tanks and trucks and groceries.

04:09.545 --> 04:10.628
so forth like that.

04:10.789 --> 04:19.655
So we left New Orleans and went down through the Panama Canal again.

04:19.735 --> 04:23.807
And 49 days later, we arrived in Japan.

04:24.142 --> 04:26.485
49 days, that's quite a trip.

04:26.505 --> 04:30.270
Quite a roundabout way to get from California to Japan through New Orleans.

04:30.951 --> 04:33.855
Those old ships wasn't made to go very fast.

04:35.698 --> 04:39.283
Now, I stated that your job was as a fireman.

04:39.303 --> 04:42.126
That's not the traditional description of the word fireman.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.952
You kind of kept the boilers going and kept the ship going the right direction.

04:45.992 --> 04:49.997
We kept the steam up to the maximum.

04:50.450 --> 04:54.555
So the ship would go as fast as it could, you know.

04:55.536 --> 05:04.067
And my job was to make sure that everything was okay in the engine room.

05:05.148 --> 05:06.530
So that was my job.

05:06.650 --> 05:08.152
That was your job.

05:08.172 --> 05:13.458
And this whole experience was quite a deal for a young kid from Hooks, Texas, who'd never even seen the water before, right?

05:13.498 --> 05:16.542
I mean, there was more water out there than I thought.

05:16.724 --> 05:20.471
You had an idea there was a lot out there.

05:20.571 --> 05:27.703
Yeah, I had an idea that there was some there, but I didn't realize there was so much, you know, because being the first time I'd seen the ocean.

05:28.144 --> 05:29.406
Right, right.

05:29.426 --> 05:31.510
Now, this was the Alfred C. True.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.263
was the ship that you were on.

05:34.283 --> 05:35.565
That was a merchant vessel.

05:35.725 --> 05:40.553
I tried to find a picture of the Alfred C. True, but I couldn't find a picture of it.

05:40.593 --> 05:45.882
I think you said it's... It was decommissioned and then sold for salvage.

05:45.942 --> 05:49.608
So it may be something else now.

05:49.728 --> 05:53.874
It's probably scattered out everywhere by now.

05:54.936 --> 05:56.959
The ship, though, had a duty in Japan.

05:57.019 --> 05:59.303
And when you all got there, talk about

05:59.536 --> 06:00.977
about when you got there?

06:01.638 --> 06:18.095
We arrived in Yokohama, Japan, and then went on down to a place by the name of Kure, K-U-R-E, Japan, is where we unloaded our cargo.

06:18.115 --> 06:27.585
And then once we were unloaded, we went back to Yokohama, and that was when they removed us crew members

06:28.527 --> 06:40.545
and put a Japanese crew aboard to ferry their people back from the islands back to the mainland.

06:40.565 --> 06:50.139
And we came back to the States as passengers on another cargo ship that was coming back over here.

06:50.399 --> 06:50.760
I see.

06:51.501 --> 06:57.910
That's fascinating how, you know, we fought the war against the Japanese, but then once the

06:58.666 --> 07:04.714
the war was over, then we served in sort of helping them get back home as part of the occupation duty.

07:04.734 --> 07:05.214
That's right.

07:06.336 --> 07:09.460
Indeed, that is space.

07:09.760 --> 07:16.929
So you came back home from the islands, March of 1946, and you went back to Hooks, Texas, right, for a while?

07:16.949 --> 07:22.176
Went back to Hooks, Texas and visited with my family for a while.

07:23.118 --> 07:26.625
The draft board told me that they was going to draft me then.

07:26.685 --> 07:28.549
They were drafting at the age of 18.

07:28.689 --> 07:33.559
And I just couldn't imagine getting drafted, you know.

07:33.639 --> 07:35.803
So I beat them to it.

07:35.883 --> 07:37.166
I went down and joined.

07:37.927 --> 07:40.673
Yeah.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.797
And was sworn into the Air Force.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.892
On August the 3rd, 1946.

07:44.912 --> 07:46.614
1946.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.875
It was the Army Air Corps back then.

07:47.895 --> 07:48.656
Army Air Corps.

07:50.338 --> 07:53.482
Wore the brown shoes back then, you know.

07:54.483 --> 08:01.591
And it was not the Air Force until later on in 1947.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.333
Why the Air Force?

08:03.373 --> 08:07.738
Did you have initial designs on being a flyer or being in the air or were you...

08:08.478 --> 08:10.941
Mainly looking for maintenance or what were you looking for?

08:11.282 --> 08:20.234
I was looking for a job in supply or something like that while I went to the Army Air Corps route.

08:20.254 --> 08:21.476
Right.

08:23.439 --> 08:33.793
And I got in there and then it became a separate service and I received training in something else and then I...

08:34.297 --> 08:35.598
Pursued that, you know.

08:35.618 --> 08:36.179
Indeed.

08:36.199 --> 08:39.882
Twenty-two years you were in the Air Force, and we'll talk about that career.

08:40.663 --> 08:49.250
After basic, you were sent to Fort Scott or Scott Air Force Base in Illinois as a telephone lineman.

08:49.611 --> 08:50.451
Yes.

08:50.671 --> 08:51.612
Climbing poles.

08:52.033 --> 08:53.314
Stringing the wires for it.

08:53.974 --> 08:58.118
And it's a long way up those poles, too.

08:59.099 --> 09:03.763
It's a lot faster coming down than it is going up.

09:04.334 --> 09:07.359
But you didn't have designs on climate polls the rest of your career, right?

09:07.379 --> 09:07.900
Oh, no, I didn't.

09:08.080 --> 09:23.324
And when they called me in and said Alaska was my choice of a station to go to overseas, you know, after basic and tech training.

09:24.045 --> 09:32.518
So I went to, was assigned to Alaska, and they called me in and wanted to know

09:32.954 --> 09:34.638
what I could do.

09:34.658 --> 09:40.290
And I told them that I was one of the best typists they'd ever seen.

09:40.311 --> 09:50.794
And that way I got into typing a career and I knew that they'd have to have that

09:51.601 --> 09:54.905
that typewriter in a warm place, you know, for it to operate.

09:54.925 --> 09:55.626
Right.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.449
And if you were where the typewriter was, then you were in a warm place.

09:58.469 --> 09:59.991
If I was the operator, I wanted it to be warm.

10:01.172 --> 10:05.317
And you told them you were an expert typer because you'd taken six weeks of typing in high school, right?

10:05.337 --> 10:06.138
I had six weeks.

10:09.162 --> 10:10.303
Well, that made you an expert.

10:10.904 --> 10:14.348
And they didn't need pole climbers in Alaska.

10:14.428 --> 10:18.132
No, they didn't need pole climbers.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.427
They needed clerk typist.

10:20.447 --> 10:21.829
So you were clerk typist at the time.

10:21.869 --> 10:24.232
It was Ladd Air Force Air Base, is that right?

10:24.252 --> 10:25.073
Ladd Air Base, uh-huh.

10:25.174 --> 10:25.694
In Alaska?

10:25.835 --> 10:27.056
Fairbanks, Alaska.

10:27.076 --> 10:27.377
I see.

10:27.477 --> 10:29.219
Which is Fort Wainwright, I believe you told me.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.461
Fort Wainwright now.

10:30.481 --> 10:30.962
Told me now.

10:31.543 --> 10:39.014
And the mission of that group up there was flying weather missions over the... Tell us about that mission.

10:39.034 --> 10:48.287
Well, it was... We flew B-29s and it was weather missions up over the North Pole.

10:48.706 --> 10:58.060
And they have to leave the engines going a long time to keep them from freezing up, you know.

10:58.080 --> 10:58.321
Right.

10:58.882 --> 11:02.227
So that was a very, very interesting too.

11:02.648 --> 11:03.228
Right, right.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.353
Now you've been married in 1946, in December of 1946.

11:07.675 --> 11:12.483
And after a while that you were in Alaska, your wife Marita was able to join you there.

11:12.503 --> 11:13.084
Is that right?

11:13.124 --> 11:14.646
Yes, that's right.

11:14.845 --> 11:24.057
She came up and joined me and got a job working on the base in the weather office as a secretary.

11:24.297 --> 11:24.658
I see.

11:24.958 --> 11:29.444
And worked there for a couple of years, you know, or a year and a half that she was up there.

11:29.965 --> 11:36.714
Matter of fact, we have a picture right now of... There is the young Leroy and Marita.

11:37.254 --> 11:41.520
Yeah, we were 18 years old when that picture was taken.

11:41.940 --> 11:42.241
Wow.

11:42.641 --> 11:43.182
And...

11:44.782 --> 11:45.803
We're still together.

11:46.564 --> 11:47.184
How about that?

11:49.286 --> 11:55.052
Well, 60 years, 1946, 62 years or 64 years.

11:55.272 --> 11:58.115
What a wonderful story.

11:58.576 --> 12:10.047
And then you were fortunate in that you were able to serve your entire 22 years, just about the whole time with you all together because she was able to follow you from assignment to assignment.

12:11.039 --> 12:19.490
We, I can't remember a time that we did not travel at the same time to another base.

12:19.850 --> 12:20.130
Right.

12:21.412 --> 12:22.794
In all the time that we were in.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.736
Right, right.

12:24.776 --> 12:32.886
Topeka, Kansas, Forbes Air Force Base, and that's where you were, you were discharged in 1946 before you re-enlisted.

12:33.227 --> 12:38.093
August 3rd, 1946, I was discharged at...

12:38.444 --> 12:41.068
Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, Kansas.

12:42.150 --> 12:54.951
And we came to Hooks and visited our families for a few days and went on to Montgomery, Alabama and reenlisted

12:55.673 --> 12:59.121
in the Air Force at Maxwell Air Force Base.

12:59.141 --> 13:06.136
Now, was that a decision that you all had already always made, that you were going to re-enlist, or were you thinking about staying retired?

13:06.377 --> 13:11.668
We left it open both ways.

13:11.809 --> 13:14.695
We didn't know whether we would...

13:15.907 --> 13:19.633
get work in civilian life or stay in the military.

13:20.314 --> 13:36.601
So we enjoyed our first three years so we decided we'd try it again and we re-enlisted at Maxwell and from there on it was working on my 20 years.

13:37.643 --> 13:40.007
Exactly, exactly.

13:40.831 --> 13:44.355
Two, three years at Maxwell, wing inspector.

13:45.396 --> 13:46.497
In the wing inspector division.

13:46.517 --> 14:01.914
I was with the wing inspector's office and it was our responsibility to inspect organizations to make sure that they were operating under the proper orders and technical orders and so forth, you know.

14:01.934 --> 14:02.175
Right.

14:02.435 --> 14:09.623
And that was, my job was to make sure all the technical orders were up to date

14:10.008 --> 14:12.250
and so forth like that.

14:12.270 --> 14:14.332
Then your next assignment was Washington, D.C.

14:14.793 --> 14:20.419
in the Air Force Officers Program in Atomic Energy.

14:20.439 --> 14:21.540
What can you tell us about that?

14:21.740 --> 14:31.550
Air Force Office for Atomic Energy, I worked for a civilian who has passed away now, Dr. William D. Erie.

14:31.570 --> 14:36.775
I worked for him, and that was a job that lasted

14:37.767 --> 14:40.251
Oh, I guess about two or three years.

14:41.392 --> 14:52.870
And I cannot go in detail on some of my jobs.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.532
That's what's called a special assignment.

14:54.752 --> 14:56.134
Yeah, it's a special assignment.

14:56.335 --> 15:04.587
You noted that in your 22-year service of the Air Force, the majority of that, you actually were not on a military base, right?

15:04.727 --> 15:06.610
In my 22 years, I was

15:07.180 --> 15:11.045
I was only on an Air Force base for 10 years.

15:11.065 --> 15:11.686
For 10 years.

15:12.247 --> 15:13.348
Right, right.

15:13.368 --> 15:17.674
Including your last assignment here in Bryan, which we'll talk about in a minute.

15:18.095 --> 15:23.982
I left Washington in 1950 and then to Shreveport, Louisiana, which wasn't far from home in Hooks, Texas.

15:24.063 --> 15:24.984
Very close to home.

15:26.326 --> 15:35.017
I was assigned to Bossier Base as an administrative specialist.

15:35.918 --> 15:37.120
And...

15:37.319 --> 15:50.562
worked in the plant where we worked on the material that we were charged with.

15:51.563 --> 15:58.976
And that lasted, what, four, five years, I guess.

15:59.016 --> 15:59.777
About five years?

16:00.098 --> 16:00.238
Mm-hmm.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.431
And then from Shreveport, Louisiana to the Philippines.

16:03.451 --> 16:04.252
To the Philippines.

16:04.552 --> 16:10.119
And I noted that you didn't serve in combat, but you must have felt that way when you were flying to the Philippines.

16:10.199 --> 16:15.885
Tell that story about the flight, because you were with Marita and your two young children at the time.

16:15.946 --> 16:18.368
I think you said Gary was nine and Debbie was five.

16:19.189 --> 16:20.731
And talk about the flight to the Philippines.

16:20.991 --> 16:25.156
Okay, we went by way of Hawaii.

16:25.216 --> 16:30.242
And of course, our daughter got air sick in Hawaii.

16:30.796 --> 16:59.217
Her mother had to take her in and clean her all up, you know, and then we got closer to Guam was our next stop, and the plane was on fire, and you could see a flame coming out of the engine, and we were beginning to land, and here came all of the,

16:59.872 --> 17:07.368
The ambulances and fire engines and so forth like that, you know, and scared a bunch of people a little bit.

17:07.629 --> 17:13.501
A little bit, yeah.

17:13.561 --> 17:18.572
We got off that plane and got on another one and started on into Guam.

17:19.177 --> 17:26.485
And the plane lost an engine, and we had the jets and the fuel come back into Guam.

17:26.785 --> 17:28.647
This was the second plane.

17:28.767 --> 17:29.168
It lost an engine.

17:29.188 --> 17:29.688
The second plane.

17:29.728 --> 17:30.689
It lost an engine.

17:30.729 --> 17:36.095
Then we... Did you think about taking a boat then?

17:36.115 --> 17:38.838
We were looking closer at a boat.

17:39.038 --> 17:40.380
Another mode of transportation.

17:40.400 --> 17:40.920
Another mode.

17:40.940 --> 17:41.721
Yeah, you couldn't drive.

17:42.382 --> 17:48.188
But we came in, and they...

17:48.995 --> 18:05.451
kept us overnight and during the night they fixed the original plane that we had come in on so the next morning we got back on that plane with all of our luggage and stuff at the

18:05.887 --> 18:16.617
we had to towed around and, uh, and we flew on in, into the Philippines and landed at Clark air base, uh, uh, the next day.

18:16.838 --> 18:22.463
Now you were assigned to the air attache office there, and it was really, you didn't wear uniform in this, in this position.

18:22.503 --> 18:25.026
Talk a little bit about your, your, your job.

18:25.046 --> 18:25.626
That was interesting.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.630
You were, you were a liaison between the U S air force and the Philippine air force.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.771
That's correct.

18:30.791 --> 18:31.852
Uh, that was our job.

18:32.072 --> 18:32.653
And, uh,

18:33.157 --> 18:43.449
Again, my position was as the administrative supervisor for the Air Adichie office.

18:44.471 --> 18:52.380
And we served for a little over three years on that assignment.

18:52.400 --> 19:00.430
And our children became acquainted with what a...

19:02.030 --> 19:02.912
embassy is.

19:04.174 --> 19:10.766
A lot of people don't get that chance to serve in an embassy.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.593
But they learned a lot.

19:14.733 --> 19:18.199
In fact, my son just commented the other day of how

19:18.635 --> 19:21.078
how much he remembered about it.

19:21.338 --> 19:22.019
Right, right.

19:22.039 --> 19:26.544
Well, you went over there, he was nine, I guess you left, and he was 12, so he would remember a lot.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.648
And even Debbie, as young as she was, she probably recalls a lot.

19:29.668 --> 19:41.622
Debbie and I had lunch together today, and she was telling me some of the things that she had remembered, such as the school building had been used as

19:42.445 --> 19:47.815
as a prison for some of the people during the Japanese occupation.

19:48.116 --> 19:49.538
Right, right, right.

19:50.320 --> 20:05.027
You left the Philippines in, I guess, the late 50s, early 60s, went to Dayton, Ohio, for an assignment there with Strategic Air Command, right?

20:07.927 --> 20:08.488
What was the name?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.350
At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

20:10.370 --> 20:10.890
Wright-Patterson, uh-huh.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.492
Yeah, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

20:13.353 --> 20:16.316
And we served there for a tour of duty.

20:17.377 --> 20:27.808
And with the bomb squadron of B-52s and KC-139s.

20:28.068 --> 20:28.709
I see.

20:29.109 --> 20:29.410
I see.

20:29.710 --> 20:34.575
And then we left there, and I came to...

20:36.057 --> 20:41.586
to school at Lackland Air Force Base for recruiting duty.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.851
And they trained me to be a recruiter.

20:45.752 --> 20:52.783
And then I served, we had six counties

20:52.915 --> 20:56.660
that we were responsible for.

20:57.160 --> 20:57.421
Right.

20:57.601 --> 20:58.842
You were assigned to Bryan.

20:59.003 --> 21:02.126
But my duty station was here in Bryan.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.468
That's where I lived.

21:03.488 --> 21:09.295
And I think you said your office was actually in downtown Bryan, where the federal building is now, or in the post office.

21:09.395 --> 21:10.357
Where the federal building.

21:10.397 --> 21:15.403
We had the building downstairs.

21:15.623 --> 21:15.903
Right.

21:16.584 --> 21:20.509
And several times, you could hear

21:22.885 --> 21:36.118
people running down the steps, you know, and they'd come in and asked to be enlisted into the military.

21:36.138 --> 21:39.982
Talk more about that duty, because this was a time in the early 60s.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.464
Vietnam was going then.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.786
Lyndon Johnson was in office.

21:44.826 --> 21:51.593
Vietnam was really the hot spot, and you were here at a college town

21:51.927 --> 21:54.571
or talk about the challenges of recruiting there.

21:54.591 --> 22:00.879
You said it was one of the most difficult jobs that you had because of the quotas you were required to.

22:01.440 --> 22:09.231
It was a difficult job, and a lot of the guys could not take it.

22:09.571 --> 22:20.787
There was a lot of pressure on somebody because you're given a quota of... We were responsible for nurses and...

22:21.425 --> 22:25.609
a special type of women, women Air Force.

22:26.350 --> 22:33.476
You get a quota for a woman and they don't go in as much as the men do, you know.

22:33.496 --> 22:45.507
So it's more difficult to get what you're assigned if you have a woman or if you have a nurse or something like that, you know.

22:47.169 --> 22:50.352
But out of the three years that

22:50.669 --> 22:52.231
I was on recruiting duty.

22:52.251 --> 23:00.344
I was fortunate enough to be number three in the Air Force all three years that I was on recruiting duty.

23:00.364 --> 23:01.525
Number three in the nation, right?

23:01.545 --> 23:01.646
Yeah.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.268
Number three in the country.

23:03.288 --> 23:04.810
So you were obviously pretty good at it.

23:04.850 --> 23:08.616
And that being here in what, at that time, was certainly a rural area.

23:08.636 --> 23:10.739
You had a... Very rural, very rural.

23:14.505 --> 23:19.933
But when the draft is looking at you, you know, and it's...

23:21.044 --> 23:25.891
that helps them make up their mind easier, you know.

23:26.231 --> 23:27.353
Yeah, I guess so.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.040
You retired in 1968 from the service after 22 years.

23:32.420 --> 23:38.809
You went to Lufkin for four years in the insurance business, but then you came back to Bryan in February of 1972.

23:39.230 --> 23:46.360
You took over as executive director of the Better Business Bureau and stayed there for 19 years, and that was a

23:46.812 --> 23:49.315
That was an interesting job, obviously.

23:49.536 --> 23:50.457
Very interesting.

23:51.478 --> 24:15.250
Being a new bureau, I had heard about the job from the guy that run the Chamber of Commerce, and I applied for the job and was hired to...

24:16.833 --> 24:22.864
be the executive director for the next 19 years, you know.

24:22.884 --> 24:23.485
Right, right.

24:23.886 --> 24:27.513
And the nature of the job was very similar to it is now.

24:27.593 --> 24:34.926
You were looking out for businesses and for the consumer and people that wanted to take your money for not good reasons.

24:35.006 --> 24:40.035
And so it was essentially the same kind of thing that they're doing now.

24:40.216 --> 24:40.917
That's right.

24:40.897 --> 24:44.262
They're still doing it, and they'll be doing it next year.

24:44.302 --> 24:56.378
As a matter of fact, I believe you told me that you used to go on radio stations and TV stations and report about people to look out for and things like that.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.703
You said that you'd even been in this studio before.

24:59.843 --> 25:01.725
Yes, I was in this studio.

25:03.327 --> 25:03.708
Ms.

25:03.808 --> 25:05.050
Colson, was that?

25:05.070 --> 25:10.397
Sharon Colson, who still does the magazine show here at KAMU.

25:10.765 --> 25:11.065
Yeah.

25:11.406 --> 25:12.227
Long time ago.

25:12.768 --> 25:14.050
Time goes by in a hurry.

25:14.110 --> 25:18.817
You were here in your capacity with the Better Business Bureau.

25:19.098 --> 25:20.160
That's fascinating.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.301
And you retired in 1989.

25:21.321 --> 25:21.722
1989.

25:21.762 --> 25:25.147
1989, that you've been retired.

25:25.207 --> 25:32.879
And I know you're very active now with the American Legion and other groups and things like that.

25:32.939 --> 25:38.528
So you and Marita like to stay busy.

25:38.879 --> 25:42.805
We do, but we're beginning to slow down.

25:43.026 --> 25:47.753
Once you get into your ages, you begin to slow down a little bit.

25:47.974 --> 25:48.535
Right.

25:48.555 --> 25:49.356
Talk about your family.

25:49.456 --> 25:51.399
You have a son, as we mentioned.

25:51.419 --> 25:56.948
I have a son who is employed by the city of College Station.

25:58.351 --> 26:05.983
He's superintendent of the roads and drainage department.

26:06.959 --> 26:19.312
of the city and then our daughter is a school teacher and has retired once but is back teaching again now.

26:19.553 --> 26:20.714
Wonderful, wonderful.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.956
I think you said you have four grandkids?

26:22.976 --> 26:24.338
I have four grandchildren.

26:25.359 --> 26:30.425
One of them, by the way, is a graduate of Texas A&M.

26:30.625 --> 26:34.649
He's a mechanical engineer with NASA.

26:35.150 --> 26:35.430
Wow.

26:35.883 --> 26:42.192
We have another, our other grandson has got 14 years in the Air Force.

26:43.214 --> 26:45.157
He's a career man.

26:45.577 --> 26:50.584
And then I have a granddaughter that's a school teacher here.

26:51.586 --> 26:55.271
She's a bilingual teacher, bilingual.

26:55.291 --> 27:02.582
And then our other little granddaughter who is a Downs, lives in

27:03.423 --> 27:05.986
at Downholm Ranch in Elgin.

27:06.166 --> 27:06.446
I see.

27:06.987 --> 27:10.371
And that's my four grandchildren.

27:10.391 --> 27:14.215
All of which you... And then I got some great-grandchildren.

27:14.235 --> 27:20.002
I wish we had time to go into them, but when they grow up, we'll talk about their careers and all that.

27:20.022 --> 27:23.045
Leroy, thank you very much for your service, and thank you for being with us.

27:23.105 --> 27:24.367
It's a fascinating career.

27:24.387 --> 27:24.827
Pleasure.

27:25.348 --> 27:25.989
My pleasure.

27:26.429 --> 27:32.316
Leroy Balmain's generation was one where service just came naturally, as did patriotism.

27:32.296 --> 27:38.565
Leaving home and joining the military was just something that young kids did when you got out of high school in the 1940s.

27:39.106 --> 27:42.471
Leroy Balmain joined when he was 17 out of Hooks, Texas.

27:43.032 --> 27:49.241
We salute him for his long service in the Air Force and then for nearly two decades of his service to his community.

27:49.261 --> 27:50.342
I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:50.362 --> 27:58.995
Be sure and join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:07.717 --> 28:10.943
Thank you.
