In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:16.296 --> 00:24.948
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.390
First National Bank.

00:26.410 --> 00:38.087
First, always.

00:39.113 --> 00:57.849
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.232
I'm Tom Turbyville.

01:00.072 --> 01:02.356
You call, we haul.

01:02.376 --> 01:06.241
That was the motto of Boat Pool 15 that roamed the islands of the Pacific.

01:06.642 --> 01:16.377
Fred Holland of the Brazos Valley was a cockswing and motor mechanic aboard the 50-foot LCM that placed our forces on the beaches to fight the Japanese during World War II.

01:16.880 --> 01:41.537
landing crafts are perhaps best known for transporting troops and tanks to the beaches of normandy on d-day but they were indeed a critical vessel in the pacific and fred holland is proud to tell us about them fred thanks for being here and thank you for your service and what great stories that you have to tell i wish we had time to tell them all but let's talk about you getting into the service i know that you were born in childress you were raised in kwana texas

01:41.517 --> 01:44.621
And you wanted to be in the Air Force, but you were drafted in the Navy.

01:44.701 --> 01:46.403
Sort of talk about how that all came about.

01:46.443 --> 01:49.206
And it ended up that the Navy and the Marines kind of fought over you.

01:49.566 --> 01:50.187
Talk about that.

01:50.848 --> 02:02.101
Well, I was off the farm and I didn't finish my high school education because in the fall of the year, cotton, we went to the cotton fields and pulled cotton.

02:03.282 --> 02:06.105
And so I missed part of my high school education during that.

02:06.165 --> 02:07.727
And that always set me back a little bit.

02:08.230 --> 02:17.228
I didn't have my high school diploma, so I was trying to get into the Air Force and had gone to Wichita Falls, Shepard Field and volunteered hoping I could make it on my

02:17.748 --> 02:26.758
an aptitude test, but before I could hear from them, I got my draft notice, which I knew was going to be the walking army, the infantry no less.

02:28.119 --> 02:29.841
And I had to go to Lubbock for my physical.

02:30.342 --> 02:47.080
And when I came out of the physical, and I was because of working in the fields, and I'd never been in a hospital a day in my life or anything, the first needle I had was the needle they stuck in my arm at the courthouse when they drafted, when they called me up, take a blood sample, which I didn't like and still don't like.

02:47.617 --> 03:11.903
got to Lubbock, came out at the end of that physical, and there was a soldier, sailor, and a marine lined up, and my medical records was following up the line, and they pushed, passed the soldier, just glanced at it, pushed it to the Navy, and the Navy said, we'll take him, and pushed him up, pushed him on up to the Marine, which is at the end of the line, and the Marine said, no, you don't get this one, he's a Marine.

03:12.828 --> 03:15.712
And so I sat there thinking I'm a victim of a practical joke.

03:16.893 --> 03:20.938
And so we stood there for, I mean, 30 seconds.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.861
Finally, one of the Marines said, well, what's it going to be?

03:23.642 --> 03:25.865
I said, you mean I'm getting a choice?

03:26.586 --> 03:30.110
Because I just assumed it was infantry.

03:30.130 --> 03:31.172
He said, you've got to do something.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.234
And I said, well, if it's a choice, I want the Navy.

03:34.376 --> 03:35.577
And he said, what?

03:35.698 --> 03:36.799
He said, what do you get against the Marines?

03:36.859 --> 03:39.122
I said, not a cotton-picking thing, but I don't know one of them.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.974
Because all my buddies, my school buddies, are in the Navy.

03:42.454 --> 03:47.101
And my chances of serving with one of them would be better in the Navy than it would be with the Marines.

03:48.183 --> 03:49.906
And he looked at the sailor and he said, well, I'll buy that.

03:50.106 --> 03:53.271
And he pushed my record back to the sailor and he stamped it and said, you're in the Navy now.

03:53.351 --> 03:58.159
So long story short, I was drafted into the Navy unexpectedly.

03:58.599 --> 04:00.062
You had another good point that you told me.

04:00.082 --> 04:01.043
You talked about...

04:01.512 --> 04:29.848
you're an infantryman when you're in the army uh you're facing an enemy from a foxhole right that was one of the things that we had discussed before as our school buddies that don't wait till you're drafted because if you do you're going to be facing your enemy from a foxhole and when he aims he's shooting at you and so my buddies had all had volunteered for the navy the ones that had gone in before i did and said if you get aboard a ship

04:30.267 --> 04:32.852
Well, the enemy's aiming at that ship, not at you.

04:33.955 --> 04:38.524
And he might hit that ship on a bow and you're on the stern.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.168
Or he might hit it on the stern and you're on a bow.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.753
But as long as that ship's afloat, you've got a place to eat and sleep.

04:43.655 --> 04:47.483
He said, and if you end up in that walking army, you're going to eat.

04:48.357 --> 04:52.863
and sleep in foxholes and you're going to be eating sea rations.

04:53.023 --> 04:53.944
It makes a lot of sense.

04:54.925 --> 05:08.443
I know there's a lot to tell about, I know you went to a boot camp in San Diego and then you went to Coronado Island for your amphibious training, but you ended up on landing crafts and people also know it as a Higgins boat.

05:09.063 --> 05:11.867
There's a history about Andrew Higgins and

05:11.847 --> 05:13.769
the naming of the boat.

05:13.789 --> 05:18.714
But these were the boats that I guess most people see when they see films or history or documentaries.

05:18.734 --> 05:19.334
They don't know what they are.

05:19.354 --> 05:20.255
They see them at Normandy.

05:20.275 --> 05:22.738
They see them landing the beaches at Normandy.

05:22.758 --> 05:26.622
But they really did have a role throughout World War II, especially in the Pacific.

05:26.682 --> 05:33.989
Sort of talk about the landing craft and the LCM, which is Landing Craft Mechanical, that you were on.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.293
I was assigned in

05:39.438 --> 05:54.432
Coronado Island to an LCM, and we had a three-man crew, a coxswain, which was a boat handler, a motormack, or a fireman, first class, or a fireman, third class, and a deckhand.

05:54.792 --> 06:01.978
Well, all of these high-sounding names were simply assignments of duty.

06:02.098 --> 06:07.183
We were all seamen third class, regardless of what we were called a qualified coxswain.

06:07.619 --> 06:13.546
seaman third class, qualified fireman seaman third class, or a deckhand seaman third class.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.070
So there was no rank above anyone else.

06:18.051 --> 06:26.821
But you were assigned to your duties according to the training we had at Coronado Island ability to handle the boat and do what.

06:26.841 --> 06:33.508
So I ended up as a coxswain aboard LCM, but they mixed my name up with three Hollands in our unit.

06:34.433 --> 06:40.982
One from Arkansas, and one from Oklahoma, and then I was from Texas.

06:41.903 --> 06:46.229
And Holland RL was the other Holland that ended up on the first draft.

06:46.249 --> 06:50.314
We were sent to San Francisco and waited six weeks for assignment.

06:51.495 --> 06:59.646
And when the first draft came up, well, they called my deckhand and my fireman, but they didn't call me.

06:59.907 --> 07:01.048
They called Holland RL.

07:01.501 --> 07:04.484
And the rest of you, report back to your barracks.

07:05.505 --> 07:06.967
And so they shipped out.

07:06.987 --> 07:08.208
And I go back to the officer in charge.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.892
I said, well, now, let's pair up the mix-up, because there goes my crew, but I didn't call.

07:12.453 --> 07:14.715
Well, he checked it out and showed up his mix-up of names.

07:15.416 --> 07:18.279
So that took six months, as I discussed with you before the show.

07:18.299 --> 07:24.165
That took six months after I got overseas for my records to catch up to me.

07:24.185 --> 07:29.871
But as a result of the mix-up, the next week, I caught him trying to catch up with my unit.

07:30.138 --> 07:35.107
I got assigned to the USAT Seabarb, which is an Army transport.

07:35.127 --> 07:38.113
And we traveled across back then.

07:38.193 --> 07:42.902
If you were faster than the fastest submarines, you went solo.

07:43.283 --> 07:46.729
If you couldn't outrun a submarine, you went troop convoy.

07:47.587 --> 07:52.314
So the sea barb was fast, thank God.

07:52.334 --> 08:02.548
And I shipped out of San Francisco December the 11th, 1943 and hit the New Hebrides Islands, Espirito Santos, December the 24th, 1943.

08:02.608 --> 08:06.594
Thirteen days zigzag course across that Pacific.

08:06.614 --> 08:08.857
That's moving because that normally takes about a month, right?

08:08.877 --> 08:09.118
Yeah.

08:09.999 --> 08:10.159
Yeah.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.586
And that's further down in Bougainville, getting well down closer to New Zealand.

08:15.907 --> 08:16.328
So

08:16.882 --> 08:27.085
Anyway, as a result of following up my unit, the receiving station was full when I got there, and they assigned me temporarily to a CB Battalion.

08:27.145 --> 08:32.196
And for one month, I was assigned to the 44th CB Battalion and made good friends with a mess cook.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.143
And I don't know whether you want to go into that story or not.

08:35.123 --> 08:38.626
Well, you started off building Quonset huts, and that was moving a lot of cement.

08:38.646 --> 08:44.431
That was outside and hot, nasty work, but you made friends with the guy in the mess hall, right?

08:44.451 --> 09:05.130
Yeah, and he was making a little, what he called, jungle juice out of anything he could confiscate out of the mess hall, and so we were assigned to a tent, six men to a tent, and so for the place to sleep, my bunk was with these five Seabees, Woodrow Watts from West Virginia, and he came in with a little gallon jug of

09:05.110 --> 09:08.873
pouring drinks for the guys in the tent and said, you want some of this?

09:08.933 --> 09:09.694
And I said, what is it?

09:09.714 --> 09:11.355
And he said, that's some stuff I brewed up.

09:12.136 --> 09:13.677
I said, well, what's it like?

09:13.717 --> 09:15.379
And he said, it's about like a light wine.

09:16.780 --> 09:19.542
Well, we go down to make a long story short.

09:19.983 --> 09:22.405
He poured my canteen cup and we drank that stuff.

09:22.465 --> 09:23.586
It tasted awful.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.829
It was alcoholic.

09:26.849 --> 09:30.772
And he said, you know where the open air theater is?

09:30.792 --> 09:31.433
And I said, no.

09:31.473 --> 09:34.375
And he said, stick around and I'll take you down and get you acquainted with everything.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.769
So he took a liking to me.

09:37.091 --> 09:39.694
Got down to the theater, and old Woodrow looked over at him.

09:39.714 --> 09:43.079
We was waiting for it to get dark enough to turn the movie lights on, open air theater.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.844
And old Woodrow looked over and his eyes were glued to the center of his nose.

09:47.565 --> 09:49.748
And I said, my God, I don't remember if that guy was cross-eyed.

09:51.110 --> 09:58.540
Before it got dark enough to see that movie, there was two screens down there and they were wallowing around.

09:59.431 --> 10:05.562
And it dawned on me that whatever that was, you know, was working on my eyes like this.

10:05.582 --> 10:08.567
And so anyway, I made good friends with Woodrow.

10:08.587 --> 10:09.008
No wonder.

10:09.489 --> 10:10.070
Yeah.

10:10.090 --> 10:14.217
And make a long story short, we were moved up the line a year later.

10:14.602 --> 10:23.756
in the Admiralty Islands and I offloaded this 44th Cebu Battalion in our boats to the Admiralty Island group and re-met old Woodrow Watts.

10:25.398 --> 10:37.977
The Admiralty Islands, talk about that because that's where you were assigned, that's where you spent a lot of time and also there was an event on November the 10th, 1944 involving the USS Mount Hood

10:38.345 --> 10:42.474
which was a boat that was in the harbor with you.

10:42.534 --> 10:46.623
You were about two miles away from the Mount Hood when there was an explosion.

10:46.664 --> 10:48.608
This is a day that you will never forget.

10:49.089 --> 10:50.953
Go ahead and take your time and talk about that.

10:51.254 --> 10:56.659
Mount Hood, Commodore Boak was the commander of the islands and he broke a Cardinal Navy rule.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.885
That ammunition ship is never to be within 15 miles of a ship of the fleet.

11:03.126 --> 11:20.063
But there were several hundred ships in that harbor at the time because it was during the Philippine campaign and they were preparing and resupplying troop ships and cruisers, destroyers, battleships of everything resupplying for that campaign.

11:21.359 --> 11:25.665
So he had the Commodore had the USS Mount Hood, which was an amnesian ship.

11:25.685 --> 11:34.097
He had it moved up into the central part of the harbor to expedite the offloading and supplying the ships of the fleet.

11:34.117 --> 11:40.026
Because if you were 15 miles in the boat doing 10 knots, it'd take you all day to take one load to the ship and back.

11:40.046 --> 11:41.829
You might get one in the morning and one in the evening.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.953
But he moved it in the ship closer.

11:46.148 --> 11:48.571
hoping against hope that nothing would happen.

11:48.952 --> 11:51.355
I want people to get an idea when you say ammunition ship.

11:51.996 --> 11:57.243
The USS Mount Hood had some 3,800 tons of ammunition on board.

11:57.263 --> 11:58.225
3,800 tons.

11:58.365 --> 12:00.428
So we're talking about a lot of ammunition.

12:00.848 --> 12:01.709
Go on.

12:02.510 --> 12:12.244
That amount of ammunition is almost equal to the first atomic explosion that was the experiment explosion in New Mexico.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.687
So anyway,

12:15.713 --> 12:34.881
My boat had been converted to an ambulance boat at that particular time, and I was at the base hospital picking up a road of convalescence to take back out of the islands to a convalescent area, but they had to fly them out at the bomber strip or the seaplane strip.

12:34.901 --> 12:44.995
And we had picked up, there were three boats that were made into ambulance boats, and we had picked up the first load at 9 o'clock in the morning, and then the other two boats had to go on the beach,

12:45.498 --> 13:10.712
and the ambulances could back up into the boat we could carry 36 stretcher cases and about 50 walking casualties right and they had just standing around and sat on the gunwals of the boat and so we had swung around and decided that the three boat crews we'd wait for each other and make the run together since it was not an urgency run and we tied up to a pontoon barge it was secured to a little earth field jetty that had a crane sitting on a

13:10.979 --> 13:16.648
the dock, and all of a sudden the sky lit up.

13:16.668 --> 13:22.077
And the sensation was that the sun rose in the middle of the harbor and exploded.

13:22.979 --> 13:26.745
And then all the contrails out of the middle of that and it lit up the whole harbor.

13:27.786 --> 13:34.978
Well, it was, I won't say I was looking straight at it, it's just that the light of, the lit up all of a sudden of the flash

13:35.920 --> 13:37.964
get your attention to me, you look that way.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.893
And that was what I saw was a gigantic Roman candleburst.

13:44.015 --> 13:49.626
And then the fallout of that was from, we were about two and a half miles roughly

13:49.943 --> 13:55.171
And we were about 100 yards past the fallout of all the ammunition and parts of the ship.

13:55.191 --> 13:56.633
The ship itself disintegrated.

13:57.354 --> 14:01.420
And it sunk 13 other ships, smaller craft from different vessels of different sizes.

14:02.741 --> 14:10.633
And I think there was 374 that official count of deaths from that explosion.

14:10.653 --> 14:15.179
But the thing that you're not accounting for is the concussion.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.723
There were two petty officers standing on that

14:18.766 --> 14:23.411
a pontoon barge, which was an empty barge, and it blowed them down like matchsticks.

14:23.431 --> 14:26.695
I mean, they were down.

14:26.715 --> 14:27.676
Well, here we are.

14:27.716 --> 14:33.583
I'm standing behind the cockpit, and I didn't get the blast from the initial burst of it.

14:35.245 --> 14:42.193
But what we weren't accounting for was the tidal wave from the explosion, which is 13, 14 feet high.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.494
You're looking way up here.

14:44.035 --> 14:47.018
And it picks us up and sets us on top of that

14:47.318 --> 14:53.845
a pontoon barge, set that barge on the dock, knock the crane off the dock, and then we go sliding back into the water.

14:53.925 --> 14:59.971
So we ended up back in the water, but the two boats on the beach picking up casualties were set high and dry inland.

15:00.852 --> 15:15.908
Well, for the next two and a half hours, we had to offload our casualties that we had already picked up and get everything back to the base hospital because we knew that there was terrible casualties in the middle of the harbor and that being an ambulance boat, we would be needed in that area.

15:16.934 --> 15:18.796
But it took two and a half hours to get there.

15:18.976 --> 15:19.456
Right.

15:19.476 --> 15:26.563
And when we got there, all it was is muddy water from the blast and just pieces of life jackets.

15:26.623 --> 15:30.446
And some of your casualties had actually been knocked off the boat also.

15:30.466 --> 15:33.068
So you had to pick them up again, take them back.

15:33.149 --> 15:33.869
Back to the base hospital.

15:33.889 --> 15:34.970
And then go look for casualties.

15:34.990 --> 15:37.312
We never got to the seaplane base or the lower base.

15:37.332 --> 15:38.834
Everything went back to the base hospital.

15:38.874 --> 15:42.597
So I don't know how many actual casualties we had from the ones.

15:42.617 --> 15:44.899
Because a bunch of our casualties ended up in the water.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.932
So I don't know how many actual casualties we had from that.

15:49.300 --> 16:13.041
History shows now that the explosion, even though I guess for a while the investigation was kept rather under wraps and secret for a long time, but investigations since then showed that it was not from attack, it was not a Japanese attack, this explosion, but indeed it was sort of careless handling of ammunition by the people, by the crew on board the Mount Hood, right?

16:13.061 --> 16:16.465
That's what we really, we knew that.

16:16.485 --> 16:18.126
Among the crews of the boat, we said,

16:18.865 --> 16:24.261
It wasn't, you know, there was rumors that a Japanese plane had flown in and other things.

16:24.762 --> 16:27.009
No, it was careless handling of ammunition.

16:27.130 --> 16:28.534
It was something that had to happen.

16:28.634 --> 16:31.262
We knew sooner or later was going to happen.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.706
Just by our experience, it's

16:32.990 --> 16:37.757
And that's why you all made it plain that you didn't want to be involved in any detachments to ammunition boats, right?

16:37.857 --> 16:37.998
Right.

16:38.478 --> 16:38.979
Right.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.504
And so we worked ammunition ships by rotation.

16:42.525 --> 16:42.745
Right.

16:43.186 --> 16:46.911
We had 250 boats roughly, I think, in our unit.

16:46.931 --> 16:53.241
And so that meant that there were generally seven boats at a time assigned to an ammunition ship.

16:53.261 --> 16:53.722
Right.

16:53.742 --> 16:55.725
But you didn't want to hang around them very long.

16:55.885 --> 16:56.786
No, they would be loaded.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.609
There were generally three holes.

16:59.078 --> 17:12.215
five holes on the ship and so they'd have a certain number of boats on each side of the ship being loaded and they would as they got loaded they would head for their designated designated area.

17:12.975 --> 17:22.167
Well again the date was November 10th 1944 and I can tell people that if you want to know more about that incident the internet is an amazing thing and if you just

17:22.535 --> 17:24.917
Type in a search engine, USS Mount Hood.

17:24.937 --> 17:26.119
You'll read plenty about it.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.040
I did see some photographs.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.202
We've got one of those photographs, as a matter of fact, coming up.

17:30.223 --> 17:36.088
Let's go ahead and go to some pictures now that Fred Holland has supplied to us.

17:36.108 --> 17:38.971
And there is a young sailor, Fred Holland.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.554
About how old were you when this picture was taken?

17:42.214 --> 17:43.055
18 years old.

17:43.075 --> 17:43.896
18 years old.

17:43.916 --> 17:49.041
So you were just fresh out of high school and fresh into the Navy, right?

17:49.061 --> 17:50.642
Fresh into the Navy.

17:50.663 --> 17:51.183
There you go.

17:51.343 --> 17:52.204
Good looking sailor.

17:52.268 --> 17:53.049
Well, thank you.

17:53.370 --> 17:57.596
Now, we've moved forward a few years because I wanted to put a picture of you and your wife.

17:57.656 --> 18:00.240
And you and your wife have been married for some, what, 57 years now?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.121
57 years now.

18:01.282 --> 18:02.183
57 years now.

18:02.203 --> 18:04.246
And that's your wife, Johnny Francis.

18:04.266 --> 18:12.338
And Lowell Meeks, the guy that this picture was taken at one of our military reunion in New Orleans.

18:12.379 --> 18:12.959
In 2000.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.682
Lowell Meeks was my deckhand.

18:14.662 --> 18:15.263
I see.

18:15.543 --> 18:21.031
Oh, I can tell you some stories with that gentleman, and he lives in Corinth, Mississippi.

18:21.051 --> 18:29.643
So he was your deckhand, and we'll talk later about what, because you were a coxswain, and then later a motormack, and then eventually you were both on the LCM.

18:29.843 --> 18:33.949
But standing between you is your wife, Johnny Francis.

18:33.969 --> 18:35.851
So I wanted to make sure that we got a picture of her.

18:35.952 --> 18:36.673
Lovely lady.

18:36.693 --> 18:36.973
Okay.

18:37.409 --> 18:40.259
Here is the picture that I found on the internet.

18:40.279 --> 18:45.478
This is the explosion of the USS Mount Hood, and you can get an idea of

18:45.745 --> 18:48.768
exactly what we're talking about.

18:48.788 --> 18:53.473
That's after the initial burst.

18:53.493 --> 18:58.239
And that was the smoke and stuff off from it.

18:58.259 --> 19:00.661
The initial burst had already happened a few minutes before.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.325
The flume of smoke went a couple of thousand feet in the air, and that's the initial.

19:04.606 --> 19:06.748
That's right after the explosion.

19:06.768 --> 19:09.030
And so you can just sort of get an idea.

19:09.050 --> 19:13.615
You can almost, just by looking at that picture, you can almost hear what kind of sound it must have been.

19:13.635 --> 19:15.077
This is about 10 miles away.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.809
This picture was taken about 10 miles away?

19:18.350 --> 19:18.770
Yeah.

19:18.790 --> 19:18.871
Wow.

19:19.371 --> 19:20.273
Seven to 10 miles.

19:21.114 --> 19:22.356
Right.

19:22.416 --> 19:23.117
Amazing.

19:23.137 --> 19:26.782
Now, here's a picture of the bay there at the Amiralty Islands.

19:26.802 --> 19:30.708
And I think this picture was taken a few hours after the explosion?

19:30.728 --> 19:32.190
A couple hours after the explosion.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.993
And that's the boiling area.

19:34.013 --> 19:37.137
And all those little specks you see out there are our boats.

19:37.157 --> 19:42.666
And you see two little islands here, Boucheloo and Bouchelang.

19:42.686 --> 19:43.647
Right.

19:45.348 --> 19:47.551
Just past those islands, you see a little cluster of boats.

19:47.611 --> 19:49.032
That is the Boat Poo 15.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.095
We were land-based.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.957
Would that be on the upper right part of the picture?

19:52.977 --> 19:55.060
The upper right part of the picture just past that island.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.202
You can see a little cluster of boats back up in there.

19:57.382 --> 19:58.023
Right.

19:58.043 --> 19:59.385
And that's Boat Poo 15.

19:59.425 --> 20:01.407
But most of the Boat Poo 15 is out here.

20:01.808 --> 20:02.248
Right.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.189
And boats picking up.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.791
Now, you see two more islands.

20:04.811 --> 20:06.173
Those were submarine islands.

20:06.574 --> 20:10.638
That's where the submarine recreation islands that when the subs came in.

20:11.560 --> 20:11.980
And...

20:12.567 --> 20:14.591
Do you see a little cove indentured?

20:14.611 --> 20:15.152
Yes, sir.

20:15.172 --> 20:23.088
Well, that little indenture was the base hospital, and that's where I was sitting when the ammunition ship, we were up in that cove when that ammunition ship blew up.

20:23.228 --> 20:29.260
So from here to there is what you can see.

20:31.585 --> 20:38.192
The largest ship to the right, just before you get to this island, was the USS Argonne.

20:38.212 --> 20:39.914
That was Admiral Halsey's flagship.

20:40.074 --> 20:40.394
I see.

20:40.434 --> 20:51.626
They lost 30 of their crew that happened to be above deck on the deck side when the explosion, so it killed nearly everybody that was above the water line or on the deck of any ships that were close.

20:52.107 --> 20:56.091
You can see the debris in the water still, right there in front.

20:56.425 --> 21:00.952
So this picture was taken from about the point of the explosion, is that right?

21:01.273 --> 21:08.144
Right, where you see that wave, that's nearly 90 feet deep there.

21:08.825 --> 21:11.149
You sort of see a circle sort of in the water.

21:11.189 --> 21:14.254
That circle is the muddy part of the water, the blast area.

21:14.294 --> 21:16.437
The ship was sitting in the dead center of that.

21:16.598 --> 21:16.918
I see.

21:17.179 --> 21:19.362
So that's right where the blast was.

21:19.780 --> 21:25.280
They're out there looking for, these boats are looking for anything they can rescue out of the water.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.308
But there was not, that ship disintegrated.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.934
There was nothing above.

21:30.259 --> 21:30.921
Okay, let's move on.

21:32.605 --> 21:42.481
And now I was looking for as good a picture as I could find of the LCM III, which is the boat that you were a coxswain of.

21:42.501 --> 21:49.252
And this is what I, and I found this, this is from a box of a Tallery model kit.

21:49.272 --> 21:58.326
And I thought this was a rather impressive artist rendering of the LCM that you were with.

21:59.251 --> 22:08.902
And see, they all had every book, the boats that were assigned for Beach Atlantic had two 50-caliber machine guns mounted just from out of the cockpit.

22:08.942 --> 22:09.883
That's what you see up there.

22:10.364 --> 22:10.765
Right.

22:10.785 --> 22:15.891
And the cockpit, little square boxes where the coxswain, that's where the boat handler.

22:15.931 --> 22:20.596
Now, there's another photograph, because your particular craft held Sherman tanks.

22:21.337 --> 22:21.417
Yep.

22:21.437 --> 22:26.743
And that's a Sherman, a rendering of a Sherman tank coming off of the craft.

22:27.364 --> 22:29.106
The Navy, the...

22:29.491 --> 22:34.958
Navy and the Marines said, we need a craft back before the Higgins made these boats.

22:35.078 --> 22:35.559
Right.

22:35.579 --> 22:38.683
We need a craft to get our troops on the beach dry-footed.

22:38.703 --> 22:39.484
Right.

22:39.504 --> 22:40.665
And to get the boats on the beach.

22:41.326 --> 22:46.653
So if you want to buy a model of Brent Holland's boat, they are available.

22:46.673 --> 22:50.218
And I don't mean to be selling models, but I thought that those were great renderings.

22:50.278 --> 22:51.520
Okay, let's move on.

22:52.621 --> 22:57.287
There is an actual photograph of one of the landing crafts coming up.

22:58.178 --> 22:58.919
coming onto the beach.

22:58.939 --> 23:02.502
I'm not sure where this is from or whether this is from Normandy or the Pacific.

23:02.563 --> 23:06.867
It's just a photograph that I found on the internet just to give another idea.

23:07.107 --> 23:09.910
I believe that one is a later model since World War II.

23:10.090 --> 23:10.491
Exactly.

23:10.611 --> 23:13.974
Probably Vietnam or that, because they enlarged it.

23:14.255 --> 23:15.316
Right.

23:15.336 --> 23:17.278
And this looks like an enlarged version of it.

23:17.738 --> 23:17.978
Right.

23:18.899 --> 23:20.641
And I'm not familiar with the new stuff.

23:20.901 --> 23:21.482
Right, right.

23:21.582 --> 23:24.605
And then there's another one.

23:25.466 --> 23:25.626
Yeah.

23:25.646 --> 23:26.447
It's an idea.

23:28.368 --> 23:29.550
of what we're talking about.

23:31.633 --> 23:40.027
You were, two years was your service in World War II aboard this.

23:40.047 --> 23:41.609
Talk a little bit more about your experiences.

23:41.669 --> 23:46.617
I know that you said that, I don't know if we have more photographs or not coming up.

23:46.677 --> 23:48.801
If we do, we'll move on.

23:48.821 --> 23:49.442
Yeah, there we do.

23:49.602 --> 23:50.864
I'm sorry, I wanted to get that.

23:50.904 --> 23:52.086
I knew we had another one in there.

23:52.506 --> 23:55.371
That's the floating barge, right?

23:55.790 --> 23:56.694
Floating dry dock.

23:56.715 --> 23:57.498
Floating dry dock.

23:57.539 --> 23:59.870
ABSD number two and number four.

23:59.910 --> 24:01.579
There was two of them in our unit.

24:01.599 --> 24:03.066
And you see the ten sections.

24:03.637 --> 24:16.241
that make that up and they were towed overseas by tugs and assembled and made into one large unit and it could float the largest battleship afloat or largest ship afloat.

24:16.261 --> 24:17.182
As you can see right there.

24:17.343 --> 24:18.264
Within three hours.

24:18.365 --> 24:19.908
The battleship at dry dock.

24:19.988 --> 24:25.999
And that's an LCM that you see going through there and there's two parts off the end of this first section right here.

24:25.979 --> 24:31.186
That's just incredible that you can actually make a dry dock that floats in the water.

24:31.606 --> 24:35.211
Now, another little interesting story on those two dry docks.

24:36.853 --> 24:41.779
They assigned every boat, every night we had air raid alert.

24:41.999 --> 24:43.922
That was just an ongoing thing.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.684
It didn't happen, but there was always.

24:46.085 --> 24:51.712
So one of the boat crews had to be assigned for air raid alert duty in case it happened.

24:52.753 --> 24:55.817
Well, this particular day, my boat was air raid boat.

24:56.793 --> 25:02.581
And at five minutes after midnight, I was called out by the dispatch, go to ABSD number two.

25:02.641 --> 25:04.864
It has been hit by an aerial torpedo.

25:06.206 --> 25:07.487
And so we had to go out at midnight.

25:07.507 --> 25:12.835
It took us an hour to get there from our base to where those two dial boxers are assigned.

25:14.176 --> 25:14.837
And we got there.

25:15.698 --> 25:22.868
And the only time in those islands was about six months after we had secured the islands that the Japs had tried to get back.

25:22.915 --> 25:32.849
And an airplane came in at straight up and down midnight on a moonlight night and dropped an aerial torpedo, dropped it topside.

25:32.869 --> 25:40.399
And on ABS number two, it hit right off a number two, number three section.

25:40.419 --> 25:42.602
But it hit outside the wing.

25:42.622 --> 25:52.095
And on ABS number four, it hit on the right by one of the huge gantry cranes that crawls up and down and calls the heavy equipment aboard the ship.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.376
So it hit both docks.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.965
No casualties, some injuries.

25:57.985 --> 26:04.060
There were some work crews sleeping aboard one of the barges where one of them hit outside.

26:04.985 --> 26:07.950
On the first one, there were some injuries, but no casualties.

26:08.892 --> 26:11.136
But we had to go out there just in case.

26:11.857 --> 26:19.791
And so that was one of the experiences that we saw, that the only attempt that the Japs had made to get back to the islands is to hit those two dry docks.

26:21.274 --> 26:25.862
But lucky, the dry docks survived it, and the ships on...

26:25.842 --> 26:27.645
in the two dried ox were not damaged.

26:27.665 --> 26:32.974
Fred, we're starting to run out of time in your career after your service was varied.

26:33.054 --> 26:40.446
Obviously, you used your mechanical skills to make a living afterwards, but a lot of people in the Brazos Valley know you as Mr. Cash Register.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.631
You sold cash registers in the Brazos Valley for years.

26:43.651 --> 26:50.302
As a matter of fact, I bought a cash register for you about 15 or 16 years ago myself, but a lot of people know you at that.

26:50.422 --> 26:50.803
But

26:50.783 --> 26:57.909
Before we go away, I want you to talk about a hobby of yours, which has really turned into just something incredible, and that's miniature railroad.

26:57.929 --> 27:04.735
I had the opportunity to see the miniature railroad you have in the attic of your home, and it's obviously a passion of yours, right?

27:04.755 --> 27:20.689
Well, it became, and I got into the hobby late, and it's a very interesting fact that railroad personnel do not get into the hobby, and if they work for the railroad, they're sick of the railroad, and they don't want any part of the hobby, so if you'll find

27:20.939 --> 27:34.202
anybody working for the hobby that was into the... While you're talking, I'm showing four photographs of what's in your attic so people can just sort of look at.

27:34.242 --> 27:40.973
We don't have really time for you to describe what we have, but obviously this is a... Well, I got into it

27:41.392 --> 27:43.556
as a retirement for something to do.

27:43.956 --> 27:56.298
I retired in 1990, but I got into the hobby in 1988 because my business associates and customers were passing away, and I'm reading obituaries and going to funerals and wondering what's happening.

27:56.318 --> 27:59.003
And I said, well, they didn't have anything to do, so that's not going to happen to me.

27:59.023 --> 28:00.205
And that gives you something to do.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.088
And we're glad that you're doing it, and we're out of time.

28:02.108 --> 28:03.130
There's so much more to tell.

28:03.150 --> 28:06.015
But thank you for your service, and thank you for being with us.

28:05.995 --> 28:06.496
My pleasure.

28:06.716 --> 28:15.746
Like Fred Holland does tell us, the bulk of any war is logistics, and landing crafts were one of the main tools of winning the war, both in Europe and in the Pacific.

28:15.826 --> 28:20.351
Brave sailors delivering other brave men to the beaches of battle.

28:20.371 --> 28:27.058
For his service, Fred Holland was awarded, among other things, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with two stars.

28:27.078 --> 28:31.483
We thank Fred Holland for his service, as we thank all veterans.

28:31.904 --> 28:32.925
I'm Tom Turbeville.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.007
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

29:01.379 --> 29:01.840
That was good.

29:02.821 --> 29:15.479
I knew when we were talking the other day that I wasn't going to have enough time to tell everything, but I've got the recording of our whole conversation the other day, too, so I'm going to gift you a copy of that, too.

29:15.660 --> 29:18.704
You can even hear us over the lawnmower, okay, the other day.

29:20.827 --> 29:25.935
Are we ready?

29:27.617 --> 29:28.298
Tell us when we're ready.

29:31.653 --> 29:32.399
We're ready, okay.

29:36.428 --> 29:42.033
The motto of Boat Pool 15 in the Pacific Theater of World War II was, you call, we haul.
