Our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:09.063 --> 00:29.430
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:30.001 --> 00:50.689
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:50.709 --> 00:51.790
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.403
Meet Ed Higgins of College Station.

00:54.643 --> 01:08.242
As a World War II navigator on six B-17 missions over Europe, he experienced his share of uncertain moments, like his very first mission to Brandenburg, the gateway to Berlin, navigator of the 36th plane group.

01:08.262 --> 01:15.392
And then there were the three missions where the beaches at Roy in France was the target, then over Dresden, finally Ingolstadt.

01:15.412 --> 01:21.540
After his tour of Europe, he became a pilot as a captain and was the ranking student officer in flight training

01:21.824 --> 01:23.646
at Bryan Air Force Base.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.030
Ed Higgins' love of flying has not stopped.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.333
At age 83, he still flies today.

01:28.353 --> 01:31.517
We welcome Lieutenant Colonel Ed Higgins to Veterans of the Valley.

01:31.537 --> 01:34.020
It's indeed a pleasure to have you, Ed, here on Veterans of the Valley.

01:34.621 --> 01:40.949
I want to move forward to get you into World War II, but talk a little bit about getting into the military and leading up to that.

01:40.989 --> 01:42.932
I know that you were a native of South Carolina.

01:42.952 --> 01:43.713
You went to Clemson.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.435
Your dad was in World War I.

01:45.770 --> 01:49.394
You were gonna go into the Army, but your buddies talked about the Army Air Corps.

01:49.575 --> 01:51.257
So sort of take it from there and lead us on.

01:51.277 --> 02:01.429
Right, and so I did go in to the Aviation Cadet Program where I went to Gulf Warfield, Mississippi, and then they sent you to College Training Detachment.

02:01.449 --> 02:06.816
I went to Sioux City, Iowa at Morningside College and got jumped two classes, which is good because

02:06.982 --> 02:09.846
Had I not, I might have been a cadet the whole war.

02:09.866 --> 02:15.996
There was like, I know several people that had that happen.

02:16.416 --> 02:18.339
So I got a little ahead of the curve.

02:18.359 --> 02:23.607
And of course, by the year at Clemson in ROTC, that gave me a little,

02:23.806 --> 02:28.273
I knew military drill and ceremonies a lot more than the typical cadet.

02:28.293 --> 02:38.970
So therefore, I was real glad when I got classified bombardier navigator and pilot, but chosen to be navigator because they had most of the pilots.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.494
And so I got into that.

02:41.474 --> 02:42.055
phase.

02:42.595 --> 02:42.815
Right.

02:42.996 --> 02:47.661
You could have been a pilot right then, so you had your choice because you had qualified in all three, like you said.

02:47.721 --> 02:48.121
Yes.

02:48.141 --> 02:49.683
You went to gunnery school in Arizona.

02:49.723 --> 02:55.469
You got your gunnery wings, and then navigator school in Louisiana graduated from there in October of 44.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.271
So take us from there.

02:57.331 --> 02:58.973
That's when you got introduced to the B-17s.

02:59.073 --> 03:05.020
Okay, and the fact that I'd gone through gunnery school where in the B-17, you had two guns up front.

03:05.040 --> 03:11.447
So that gave me a step up when I wanted to go to B-17s, and I did go to Tampa, Florida, MacDill Air Force Base.

03:11.427 --> 03:23.922
which is still an active base, in a training situation where we formed up a crew and our commander, the first pilot was Sam Burrows, a former football player at Auburn.

03:23.942 --> 03:33.894
He was an old guy, 24 years old, although our bombardier was a former policeman from Detroit and he was 30, but most of us were under 20.

03:34.235 --> 03:34.575
I was 18.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.017
18 years old.

03:36.402 --> 03:36.702
Wow.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.388
Young and probably wondering what you were getting into, right?

03:40.408 --> 03:42.391
Right, but I felt invulnerable.

03:42.731 --> 03:44.834
I didn't realize there would be a few moments of terror.

03:45.535 --> 03:45.736
Right.

03:45.916 --> 03:53.107
Well, talk about that because you were on quite an active mission to begin with, and you didn't know that it was as active as it really was.

03:53.627 --> 03:54.569
Talk about the B-17.

03:54.589 --> 03:55.931
This was your plane.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.815
Obviously, it's a key mission.

03:58.795 --> 04:02.539
aircraft of World War II and I know you're proud to be part of it.

04:02.959 --> 04:13.871
They made over 12,000 of them and I know there's an exact number that the Confederate Air Force has when they go out on missions now called the commemorative Air Force.

04:13.891 --> 04:22.660
But it was a plane that was supposed to be able to take a lot of punishment and come back and it did in so many cases.

04:22.808 --> 04:26.835
Of course, we never had but one occasion at Dresden where we did lose an engine.

04:27.355 --> 04:30.260
And they said, give me a heading to Switzerland.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.723
And I did 240.

04:32.484 --> 04:38.794
And then we got this engine going again and began to look for other planes to join up on.

04:38.814 --> 04:43.402
So it was a plane that I had a great love for and still do.

04:43.843 --> 04:47.128
It's great in that I'm in the commemorative Air Force and

04:47.294 --> 04:50.839
occasionally get to fly on the Lone Star Flight Museum B-17.

04:51.280 --> 04:57.550
And if we ever get the one in Houston restored, we've been working for five years to put it back.

04:57.570 --> 05:00.354
It had a lot of corrosion because of being outside.

05:00.454 --> 05:02.117
Now it's in a hangar at Hobbit.

05:02.137 --> 05:03.178
I see.

05:03.198 --> 05:10.129
Of the many World War II flyers that we've had on Veterans of the Valley, I've probably had more navigators than any other job

05:10.447 --> 05:17.915
Talk about the job of being a navigator for a plane this size, for a bomber this size, and sort of what your duties were to keep them on course, right?

05:18.056 --> 05:18.236
Right.

05:19.337 --> 05:39.660
On a typical mission, you have navigators go to a certain place and pilots have their briefing, and there will be a staff that have worked out the course and speeds and checkpoints, and you get briefed there, and then you all get together as a crew, and you fill in all the crew on what you're doing, where you're going,

05:39.910 --> 05:45.478
and what the probability, if it's gonna be flack or fighters, the probability of that.

05:45.999 --> 05:48.422
Of course, in training, you don't have that problem.

05:48.442 --> 05:51.086
You just practice formation flying a lot.

05:51.627 --> 05:52.688
Right.

05:53.189 --> 05:59.237
Six missions over Europe, and you chronicled them very well in the very first one, like we said in the opening.

05:59.658 --> 06:03.223
This was your first flight, and you were the number two plane in your 36th plane group.

06:03.664 --> 06:08.270
And this was a mission, the Berlin mission to Brandenburg, which was the gateway of Berlin.

06:08.511 --> 06:09.512
Talk about that mission.

06:09.492 --> 06:13.857
Well, it was beautiful weather, and so we formed up.

06:14.157 --> 06:21.786
The way you formed up, you took off from your base at a certain interval, and you honed in on a buncher beacon, they called it.

06:22.086 --> 06:25.129
And as a navigator, I would tell my pilot, okay, home in, Sam.

06:25.450 --> 06:32.438
And you kept climbing, and if there were clouds in, you would pop out above the clouds and form up in the whole group, and it would head out.

06:32.478 --> 06:36.582
There was what they called like a lead cow, the rally point airplane.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.284
And so...

06:38.534 --> 06:44.807
You headed out, it's a space, and it was really beautiful to see the other planes behind our head.

06:45.288 --> 06:48.776
And once you got over France, here came the fighters racing by.

06:48.816 --> 06:51.722
There was no need for them to take off until later.

06:51.742 --> 06:56.352
And that was really high adventure, seeing them racing to the front of the lead planes.

06:56.552 --> 06:57.454
Right, right.

06:58.143 --> 07:02.507
These planes flew in groups, actually 1,000-plane groups.

07:02.867 --> 07:06.030
That must have been to be able to look out and see something like that.

07:06.070 --> 07:08.472
I cannot imagine how awesome a sight that might be.

07:08.492 --> 07:16.319
Yeah, after we had flown about four missions, we got to be the lead, the Rallye Point airplane, which was a high honor.

07:16.719 --> 07:26.648
We took off first, we established ourselves, and then we headed out and called, and the first group came behind us, and we got clear over to France,

07:26.628 --> 07:34.317
And then we turned back, and I'll never forget seeing the beauty of group after group after group all tucked in in formation.

07:34.658 --> 07:41.826
We didn't get credit for a combat mission, but that gave us the potential to be a lead crew had the war continued.

07:42.147 --> 07:47.553
I certainly didn't know that the Germans were going to, we thought the Germans were going to hold out at Hitler's Redoubt.

07:48.114 --> 07:51.258
It turned out that that was only a fantasy.

07:51.699 --> 07:54.502
The war was quickly over May 8th.

07:55.123 --> 07:55.403
Right.

07:55.636 --> 08:00.326
You talked about flak, and we've had other people on the show that talk about it, and it's a scary thing.

08:00.386 --> 08:08.504
It was one of the weapons, obviously, of World War II, and it made rides very dicey and very bumpy at times.

08:08.785 --> 08:10.308
You engaged a lot of flak.

08:10.388 --> 08:15.720
Right, both at Berlin and at Dresden and at Ingolstadt.

08:16.055 --> 08:20.038
Those three now, the three at Royan, it was low stuff.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.940
You could see them shooting, but it was way below.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.421
They didn't have the big 88s.

08:23.922 --> 08:34.911
But the others, you'd see, it was just like in the movies where you'd see the poof of a flak, and I saw one hit a P-51 escort, and it just disintegrated.

08:35.051 --> 08:40.576
And I saw another B-17 get hit, and it was spinning in just like the old Piper J-3 Cub.

08:41.056 --> 08:43.298
And you wondered, why aren't they getting out?

08:43.858 --> 08:45.960
Maybe they did later, but...

08:46.480 --> 08:49.846
It was very, and I didn't know that was a rough mission.

08:49.886 --> 08:52.250
I thought maybe it's like this every time.

08:52.311 --> 08:57.019
And when I got back and I was debriefing, they said, boy, that was a rough one.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.842
Oh, okay, I didn't know any better.

08:59.764 --> 09:05.755
Your second mission, which I think was three consecutive days, your second, third, and fourth missions, three consecutive days,

09:05.937 --> 09:08.601
The target was actually France, Royan France.

09:08.641 --> 09:10.623
Talk about why that was and what the mission was.

09:10.643 --> 09:24.182
Okay, that was the gateway to the port of Bordeaux, and the French needed to open that up so they could get supplies to refurbish all the areas that had been blown up during the invasion and the battle across France.

09:24.162 --> 09:28.890
So the French Navy was poised with troops off the coast.

09:28.970 --> 09:38.447
As soon as we had hit the three days of softening it up, they came in and made their invasion and quickly subdued, I think, some 100,000 Germans.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.188
That were in the way.

09:39.428 --> 09:41.031
That were holding that port.

09:41.191 --> 09:41.432
Right.

09:41.793 --> 09:49.005
I want you to talk about, you referred to this earlier, one time much later on in your career at a Confederate Air Force event.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.436
you ran into a pilot, a German pilot, right?

09:52.656 --> 09:52.997
Right.

09:53.157 --> 09:57.146
A German pilot that had been at Brandenburg and he was one of the jet pilots.

09:57.166 --> 10:00.574
And of course they were far superior to anything we had.

10:01.295 --> 10:03.079
And I think there was a,

10:03.700 --> 10:07.507
a gunner later shot one down and he got a distinguished flying force.

10:07.527 --> 10:16.183
But it's interesting to know that the first German jet shot down was by the Tuskegee Airmen, who were great pilots.

10:16.243 --> 10:21.152
They were almost all college graduates and determined to show that they could be better than anybody.

10:21.132 --> 10:23.395
as they proved they were in their unit.

10:23.576 --> 10:23.976
Exactly.

10:24.016 --> 10:24.958
But that was interesting.

10:25.679 --> 10:27.602
But we didn't see any of those shot down.

10:28.042 --> 10:34.652
I saw them take off at Brandenburg and go over the top, hit a plane ahead and hit a plane behind, and they missed us.

10:34.672 --> 10:35.714
It wasn't my day to go.

10:36.014 --> 10:36.755
Right, right.

10:36.976 --> 10:38.718
But talk about this fellow that you met.

10:38.738 --> 10:45.408
But he did say that he went out, he couldn't get to his plane, so he went out into the woods, hiding behind a big tree, and here came bombs hitting.

10:45.729 --> 10:50.616
Well, one of our squadrons overshot a bit, and some of the bombs hit out in the woods.

10:50.596 --> 10:52.698
And he wondered how we knew he was there.

10:52.758 --> 10:53.239
We didn't.

10:53.659 --> 10:57.023
And we both shook hands and laughed and said, we're glad we didn't get each other.

10:57.043 --> 10:59.125
He and I was a citizen of Canada.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.286
Right, right.

11:00.306 --> 11:04.030
And you all shook hands and said, I'm glad you're here and I'm glad that I'm here.

11:04.050 --> 11:04.591
Right.

11:04.611 --> 11:10.377
There was a lot of camaraderie among, if you were captured, you hoped that the Luftwaffe got you.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.019
They would hide you from the SS.

11:12.359 --> 11:16.063
You would swap wings and then you would go to prison camp, which was no problem.

11:16.482 --> 11:36.043
hilton but it beat the heck out of anything in japan right or if the ss got you or the worst would of course the civilians and i don't blame them if you just blown up the family barn right you would be a bit ticked off right right well it was a civil situation i know i've i've read a book uh about the uh the the

11:36.445 --> 11:41.411
prisoner of war camp in Hearn, that we have down here in Hearn, where the Germans were held there.

11:41.431 --> 11:42.913
And it was that type of thing.

11:43.293 --> 11:49.901
Second mission, or the third mission, excuse me, at Royan, and it involved what we know now as napalm.

11:50.301 --> 11:51.303
Yes, uh-huh.

11:51.323 --> 11:52.924
Jellied gasoline, we called it.

11:52.964 --> 12:04.478
We didn't know any better, but that was what was used pretty well to subdue Japan, the missions there, until finally they dotted the T with the two A-bombs.

12:04.829 --> 12:07.535
But they had pretty well bombed it out.

12:07.916 --> 12:17.617
Now, we were, of course, after we had done our missions and came back to the States, we were supposed to fit out into B-29s and go as our group to Japan in B-29s.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.925
But, of course, that didn't get to happen, and I accepted it.

12:21.366 --> 12:21.606
Right.

12:22.497 --> 12:28.844
Your fifth mission, Dresden, and I know that this has a very, it's a sad story to it, as you suspect.

12:29.324 --> 12:29.985
Talk about that.

12:30.346 --> 12:37.854
Well, I noted, and I have a log, and I was looking at it about a month ago, and I put it somewhere in my house, and I can't find it.

12:38.474 --> 12:45.963
But anyway, I noted there were 500, I estimate, railroad cars on the railroad tracks there, and they were pointing east.

12:45.983 --> 12:50.968
We were always supposed to point out anything we saw, but in the break in the clouds, we saw those.

12:50.948 --> 12:53.192
And I thought they were loaded with German troops.

12:53.933 --> 12:58.761
Probably they were loaded with German Jews that were being sent to the Holocaust.

12:58.781 --> 13:00.624
I didn't even know there was such a thing then.

13:01.185 --> 13:06.835
And of course, I would have posted it when we got back and I don't know where they went back and shot it up or bombed it or what.

13:06.855 --> 13:07.816
I hope they didn't.

13:08.257 --> 13:08.738
Exactly.

13:09.292 --> 13:11.355
You lost an engine on that mission.

13:11.375 --> 13:11.635
Right.

13:11.656 --> 13:15.081
We had a prop runaway, and so we couldn't feather it.

13:15.181 --> 13:21.170
And that's bad because eventually it may break off and do a lot of damage like bring the plane down.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.475
So we finally got it to reduce power.

13:24.695 --> 13:25.977
We broke out of formation.

13:26.037 --> 13:31.104
We ducked into clouds and began to work with it.

13:31.525 --> 13:33.828
And my pilot said, give me a heading to Switzerland.

13:34.169 --> 13:36.953
So I said, 240, and then we'll fine-tune it.

13:37.287 --> 13:41.941
Anyway, we broke out of the clouds and here is another plane right with us.

13:42.302 --> 13:45.813
I mean, like in formation, but neither saw each other, of course.

13:46.314 --> 13:50.908
My guardian angel was on duty that day because we broke out then.

13:51.142 --> 13:56.049
And we started fiddling with that engine and began to get partial power.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.073
So then my pilot said, give me a heading to England.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.495
Okay, let's do 280.

14:00.715 --> 14:07.865
And so we started join up with all kinds of planes that had broken, got into the weather.

14:07.885 --> 14:11.209
And we ended up with 12 planes and no two from the same group.

14:11.375 --> 14:21.309
Well, as we were flying back, we saw this plane coming down from the northwest, and it didn't look like it was one of ours or anybody.

14:21.329 --> 14:23.933
So we knew the Germans had some fake airplanes.

14:23.973 --> 14:29.941
That is, they had captured planes, and they would drive up into the formation and shoot some down.

14:29.961 --> 14:37.652
So we put a burst out across the plane, and it broke off and went back toward Germany, the northern Germany.

14:37.632 --> 14:39.274
So it probably was one of those.

14:39.774 --> 14:44.379
There was a squadron they had of replica airplanes that had been rebuilt.

14:45.300 --> 14:45.420
Right.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.623
And your sixth mission, Ingolstadt, what was that?

14:47.643 --> 14:54.430
Ingolstadt was supposed to be at Munich because there were German jets parked on the Autobahn.

14:54.910 --> 15:01.597
The Germans were thinking ahead when they built those Autobahns and had areas where you could literally have airfields.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.439
And there were 300 German jets there.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.863
Well, when we got over there, they reported that they

15:07.248 --> 15:10.614
were out of fuel, no need to bomb them.

15:10.634 --> 15:13.919
So we then picked up a target of opportunity.

15:14.019 --> 15:21.632
Our second was Engelstadt, which was a town and it had a bridge over the Rhine, so why not knock it out?

15:22.193 --> 15:24.276
So we all dumped on poor old Engelstadt.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.939
Indeed, indeed.

15:26.019 --> 15:32.850
We have some photographs and some very compelling photographs that Lieutenant Colonel Higgins has brought

15:33.185 --> 15:38.491
and some of these photographs were taken from his plane on one of some of these bombing missions.

15:38.511 --> 15:49.042
This is out of sort of a yearbook that you have of your group, and this is the front inside cover that we got a scan of, and you're actually flying in that airplane, right?

15:49.062 --> 16:03.057
Yeah, that is that first mission to Berlin with Bob Glazen of Beaumont, the head, the backup pilot, the deputy lead, and of course, had that lead ship up there, which probably had Major Carmack,

16:03.037 --> 16:05.583
who was a great west border and a great leader.

16:06.244 --> 16:12.799
Unfortunately, he later was killed in a plane crash later on in his career, which was a pity he'd have made General a great leader.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.048
So I was up there navigating the way, following.

16:17.068 --> 16:17.569
There you go.

16:18.207 --> 16:20.110
Let's move on to the next one.

16:20.130 --> 16:20.931
Here's your group.

16:20.951 --> 16:23.395
And that is my crew picture.

16:23.815 --> 16:33.730
Sam Burr is on the left and George Nichols, the bombardier, and Owen Paul, who is still alive out in Seattle, Washington.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.593
And there I am on the right, the lower level.

16:35.653 --> 16:42.223
And then the other mazooker on the left was the best deputy pilot, Noy Eisenhawker.

16:42.203 --> 16:45.450
And then on the right is the ball turret gunner.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.813
They were always free spirits.

16:47.093 --> 16:53.326
You really had to bail them out, but you'd throw them, bust them in private, and then promote them back to Sergeant Chandler.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.271
And he's still alive in New Orleans.

16:55.852 --> 16:56.353
It's amazing.

16:56.393 --> 16:59.740
You might forget who you met yesterday, but you'll never forget these names, will you?

17:00.226 --> 17:03.012
Let's move on to another one.

17:03.032 --> 17:03.694
Talk about that.

17:03.714 --> 17:05.317
That's a good-looking young man.

17:05.378 --> 17:17.525
That was the day I went into the Air Force as an aviation student to report to Gulf Fort Field, Mississippi, and that was my famous dog spot, a bird-dog champion.

17:17.865 --> 17:19.028
I loved to quail hunt.

17:19.008 --> 17:25.679
And my bike, I left to ride my bike over to play baseball, and I was heading off for the adventure.

17:26.020 --> 17:29.025
You had to say goodbye to not only your family, but to the spot too, right?

17:29.045 --> 17:30.027
Yep.

17:30.047 --> 17:31.048
Yeah, that must have been tough.

17:31.169 --> 17:34.634
Yeah, of course, I was still not very sad.

17:34.695 --> 17:37.539
I was looking forward to what was next.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.082
It's a fine-looking bicycle there.

17:39.302 --> 17:44.351
Yeah, a sterling bicycle built like a watch.

17:44.371 --> 17:45.032
All right.

17:45.012 --> 17:53.183
Okay, this is Royan, the first day of the bombing.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.145
And you see the target there is the beach.

17:55.506 --> 18:00.192
And if you look right in the middle of the picture, you see the cluster of bombs that have just left your airplane.

18:01.374 --> 18:05.359
That's just a fascinating photograph.

18:05.379 --> 18:06.721
And then we've got a sequence here.

18:07.081 --> 18:08.483
Let's go on to the next one.

18:08.503 --> 18:10.405
Here the bombs are closer to the target.

18:10.425 --> 18:13.129
They're a little bit more spread out as they're heading down.

18:13.109 --> 18:18.145
And that's the city of Royanne that we see there that's on the beach.

18:20.272 --> 18:22.579
And then move on to the third one and the bombs have dropped.

18:23.302 --> 18:30.291
And you can see sort of in the right center of the photograph where the bombs have dropped and the smoke is rising.

18:30.311 --> 18:38.202
Yeah, that's more inland where the Germans had retreated into their bunkers or revetments or whatever, but they didn't have their heavy guns anymore.

18:38.562 --> 18:42.407
And these are photographs that were taken out of your airplane at the time that it happened.

18:42.427 --> 18:43.909
All right, let's move on.

18:45.172 --> 18:45.733
What's this group?

18:45.973 --> 18:52.502
Okay, that's when I was at Bryan, no, Spencefield, Georgia, in primary pilot screening.

18:52.662 --> 18:58.230
The man on the left is Joe Barker, class of 50 A&M, and that's Mr. Shube.

18:58.430 --> 19:02.095
I'm in the Air Force uniform.

19:02.295 --> 19:04.939
I was airdromal officer for that day.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.381
We took turns doing it.

19:06.401 --> 19:07.382
I'm a captain.

19:07.362 --> 19:16.736
And there's Mr. Shube, a great instructor-pilot, and that's a French student right there, Balain, and a Belgian Balafan on the right.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.439
We had foreign students in there.

19:18.739 --> 19:24.327
We had one that laid the chassis his father made commander of the French Air Force.

19:24.347 --> 19:24.788
Right.

19:24.808 --> 19:25.990
And he was in another unit.

19:26.310 --> 19:26.871
What's that plane?

19:26.931 --> 19:27.392
Is that an Avenger?

19:27.472 --> 19:28.614
And that's the T-6 Texan.

19:28.754 --> 19:29.114
Oh, okay.

19:29.134 --> 19:34.482
And I laid the cream across that exact airplane owned by somebody.

19:34.823 --> 19:36.205
I knew the tail number.

19:36.185 --> 19:43.152
And somebody at an air show at, I believe, at Brownsville.

19:43.172 --> 19:43.493
Yeah.

19:44.454 --> 19:45.755
My exact airplane.

19:46.095 --> 19:46.436
All right.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.898
Let's move on to the, I think we've got one more.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.540
That's one of your planes.

19:50.600 --> 19:55.805
Yeah, that was a plane that most everybody had one with that rather interesting name.

19:56.046 --> 20:00.210
And it had steel plates on the side and underneath.

20:00.270 --> 20:03.053
And I got to fly a couple of those missions.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.096
that I flew were in that airplane.

20:05.156 --> 20:07.839
Right, and so people can see where the navigator was.

20:07.879 --> 20:08.180
Right.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.903
The bombardier is in the nose, and then you're right behind the bombardier.

20:10.923 --> 20:14.288
And you can see that little package right behind the nose is one of my guns.

20:14.308 --> 20:15.109
Right, with the three small windows.

20:15.129 --> 20:23.280
And there was one on the other side, and those two windows is where I looked out, and I had a turret where I could shoot the stars or get the headings.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.042
Right, and you operated a gun on each side.

20:25.302 --> 20:25.563
Right.

20:25.803 --> 20:26.644
Right, right.

20:28.193 --> 20:28.733
All right.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.377
Who's that guy with Ed Higgins?

20:32.617 --> 20:32.857
Right.

20:33.538 --> 20:40.624
Bob Hope, who was a great friend of the military, and he came here, I believe, in 84 to speak.

20:41.344 --> 20:52.454
And I know Jackie Sherrill made him an honorary Aggie, but I was in my Confederate Air Force uniform, and we made him an honorary colonel in the Aggie wing.

20:52.814 --> 20:56.918
And he said, I'll play golf down at Palm Springs and wear that cap.

20:56.898 --> 21:02.221
So he came here to speak, and I always greatly admired what he did.

21:02.482 --> 21:03.909
Right, right.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.933
He's looking right at you.

21:05.673 --> 21:10.100
And this is a poster that you have that we took a picture of, a final view of the B-17.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.903
That's a beautiful poster.

21:11.923 --> 21:12.905
And you flew in this plane.

21:12.925 --> 21:23.342
Yeah, I flew a practice mission in that mission, that airplane after the war, when we were training to go sharpen up our navigation and then go convert to B-29s.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.966
And it was called A Bit of Lace.

21:26.087 --> 21:29.993
It was named for one of the Steve Canyon...

21:29.973 --> 21:32.841
airplane, one of his things he had.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.689
So it was the nose art.

21:36.151 --> 21:38.598
And you see it had a lot of emissions on it.

21:38.618 --> 21:39.460
Those are great pictures.

21:39.912 --> 21:50.067
I know like most who fought in Europe after the war in Europe was over, you, like everybody else, was planning to go west to go to Japan, but then the bomb changed all that.

21:50.849 --> 22:00.042
You went to Northwestern State, got a math degree, you went to grad school at Colorado, and then you were recalled to active duty after serving in the reserves.

22:00.062 --> 22:01.965
Sort of take us from there and tell us what you did.

22:02.025 --> 22:05.110
When I was recalled to active duty, I went to...

22:05.090 --> 22:12.200
sent down to California and got upgraded as Navigator, our bomb instructor.

22:12.562 --> 22:13.767
Then I came to Ellington

22:14.067 --> 22:20.117
and where at Ellington, I was a flight commander and would take students all the way through the navigation training in Bombardier.

22:20.718 --> 22:35.561
I had a class that had such pretty girls, and I recommended one guy for instructor, and when he came back for his vacation, he introduced me, and that was my first wife, who I lost to cancer later, but Virginia Wills.

22:35.721 --> 22:41.931
Wills was her father, who was a doctor at Baylor Med School, and had been a commander in the Navy in World War II.

22:41.911 --> 22:43.694
and a great gentleman.

22:43.994 --> 22:55.613
Anyway, she went with me on my career, and her uncle was commander of the Louisiana Air National Guard, had flown the hump, and she said, I got a chance to go to pilot school, and she said, great, you ought to go.

22:55.633 --> 23:02.304
So the next day, I walked my thing through Flytaf headquarters, and away I went to Moultrie and then to Bryan Air Force Base.

23:02.324 --> 23:05.910
Yeah, you found out at age 30 that you could still be a pilot.

23:06.194 --> 23:07.696
I was delighted.

23:07.856 --> 23:08.537
I love flying.

23:08.577 --> 23:19.009
I had gotten my private pilot license when I was over at Northwestern so I could fly Piper J3 Cubs, but this was nice to be able to fly jet trainers here at Bryan.

23:19.129 --> 23:20.530
Right, and you were a captain by then.

23:20.570 --> 23:28.239
I was a captain, so that beat being a cadet, but I was glad to help straighten up after we did our flying every day.

23:28.579 --> 23:29.080
Right.

23:29.363 --> 23:33.149
Eventually, you went to San Antonio for training in the spy plane, the U-2.

23:33.169 --> 23:33.489
Talk about that.

23:33.509 --> 23:34.431
I was going to go there.

23:34.451 --> 23:35.252
You were going to do that.

23:35.272 --> 23:36.274
It never came out.

23:36.574 --> 23:43.485
After I graduated, I went back to Ellington, where we were going to get some multi-time and then go to the U-2 program.

23:43.525 --> 23:45.909
But then they found I didn't have enough time.

23:46.389 --> 23:57.767
So instead, I ended up going overseas to Newfoundland, flying in the Arctic, which was great in that I flew with some great instrument pilots and learned how to fly very good instruments.

23:58.068 --> 24:05.548
And when I came back, I came back to Ardmore, Oklahoma, and came down to visit at A&M.

24:06.150 --> 24:11.464
And Dr. Fred Smith and his wife, Odette, were friends of Colonel Dittman.

24:11.504 --> 24:14.372
And I interested, I said, I would like to be an instructor.

24:14.723 --> 24:17.265
So she picked up the phone, called Colonel Dittman.

24:17.866 --> 24:19.007
I went over to visit with him.

24:19.047 --> 24:24.011
He picked up the phone and called Fly Dive headquarters and said, I want this man.

24:24.552 --> 24:28.435
So then I was at A&M instructing, and after four years, I got a chance.

24:28.455 --> 24:32.299
General Schreiber said, get another degree, and I'll put you in the space program.

24:32.699 --> 24:35.441
So at 36, I got my Texas Aggie degree.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.524
I was delighted to become officially an Aggie.

24:38.784 --> 24:39.385
Exactly.

24:39.545 --> 24:42.908
Because I admired them so much, and then to be one.

24:42.888 --> 24:59.291
And of course, I ended up back in the space program for my final career, but then went to Northrop after I retired at NASA for 15 years in all the exciting and some catastrophe areas.

24:59.311 --> 24:59.891
Right, right.

25:00.192 --> 25:02.094
Production and procurement, that's what you were in.

25:02.215 --> 25:04.958
I was in production and procurement as a senior engineer.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.603
And what did that involve at NASA, just briefly?

25:08.623 --> 25:12.709
Well, it involves putting together a proposal, usually,

25:12.875 --> 25:14.416
I would track what we were doing.

25:14.837 --> 25:23.965
Every month I got a printout from our computer section as to how we were doing on our pricing and if we needed to hire or fire.

25:24.605 --> 25:26.447
And Northrop was a wonderful company.

25:27.027 --> 25:34.834
And when my late wife was infected with breast cancer, they said, just come in when you can, but I had a good staff.

25:35.314 --> 25:38.317
And so that was wonderful, the way they took care of her.

25:38.878 --> 25:41.700
And incidentally, after I lost her,

25:41.731 --> 25:47.160
One of the ladies who was taking care of her after about a year and a half said, I think you ought to meet somebody.

25:47.181 --> 25:49.164
And I said, well, I'm not looking.

25:49.184 --> 25:52.951
And that was my little Paige, who was a teacher at St.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.275
John's and a wonderful lady.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.721
And when I met her and some of her students said, you were just a wonderful teacher.

25:58.741 --> 26:00.043
I said, I like what I'm hearing.

26:00.023 --> 26:00.665
That's right.

26:00.705 --> 26:02.990
And now we're 31 years down the road.

26:03.010 --> 26:03.411
Indeed.

26:03.572 --> 26:05.276
You married her in 1977.

26:05.637 --> 26:12.915
You came back to work at A&M where you still work today in the Department of Animal Science.

26:12.955 --> 26:15.482
Just talk briefly about what you do because you work every morning.

26:15.722 --> 26:16.003
Right.

26:16.524 --> 26:17.627
We have projects

26:18.046 --> 26:26.576
through the Texas A&M Experiment Station, but it's in the animal science building, where we take whatever product is put before us.

26:26.916 --> 26:27.977
We might sniff it.

26:28.298 --> 26:29.659
We might see how it looks.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.241
Usually we taste it.

26:31.702 --> 26:34.965
And we are in isolation booths, which are rated.

26:35.406 --> 26:37.248
And it's a fun, interesting job.

26:37.548 --> 26:40.932
Many are PhD or master programs.

26:41.468 --> 26:47.701
I've seen people go on to great promotions and great jobs down.

26:47.781 --> 26:50.667
After all, everybody loves to eat and needs to eat.

26:50.687 --> 26:51.669
Absolutely.

26:51.689 --> 26:54.315
And the 30 minutes goes so quickly and we are out of time.

26:54.335 --> 26:55.818
But what a wonderful, wonderful career.

26:56.158 --> 26:58.363
And we thank you for being here and thank you for your service.

26:58.343 --> 26:59.284
Thanks for having me.

26:59.344 --> 26:59.725
All right.

27:00.145 --> 27:12.379
Ed Higgins career took him from the European theater of World War Two to NASA and the space program and eventually as a civilian to Texas A&M, where he still works as a program assistant in the animal science department.

27:12.419 --> 27:19.568
He and Paige have been married 31 years, and he'll proudly speak of his children, his grandchildren and his three great grandchildren.

27:19.588 --> 27:22.951
We salute the service of Ed Higgins of College Station as we do all veterans.

27:23.492 --> 27:24.433
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:24.453 --> 27:26.916
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:17.487 --> 28:23.498
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank of
