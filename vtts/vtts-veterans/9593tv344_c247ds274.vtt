00:33.092 --> 00:37.645
Hello everyone and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:37.665 --> 00:39.167
My name is Tom Turbiville.

00:39.873 --> 00:48.982
Our purpose here today is to give a very well-deserved spotlight on the men and the women who gave some of the best years of their life to defend their country.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.465
Some served on the front lines.

00:52.825 --> 00:54.467
Some served in support roles.

00:55.187 --> 00:57.489
They all gave their best years.

00:57.509 --> 01:08.800
And we are going to honor those veterans of the Brazos Valley, including those that are fighting now in Operation Iraqi Freedom, those who fought in Vietnam, those who fought in Desert Storm, Korea,

01:09.218 --> 01:14.886
and the people that we fondly know now as our greatest generation, the men and the women who fought in World War II.

01:15.267 --> 01:19.914
It is my very pleasure to introduce you to Dr. Jim Cooper, Lieutenant Commander, U.S.

01:19.994 --> 01:21.216
Navy.

01:21.236 --> 01:23.039
Dr. Jim Cooper, how are you, doctor?

01:23.279 --> 01:24.801
I'm doing fine today, Tom.

01:24.821 --> 01:31.952
Dr. Cooper is my doctor that I'm very proud to say, and he is a practicing physician here in the Bryan College Station area.

01:32.354 --> 01:37.321
And you're one of the youngest, actually, veterans of World War II that we have here in the Brazos Valley.

01:37.361 --> 01:39.585
You served both in Korea and in World War II.

01:39.725 --> 01:45.553
I am the youngest World War II veteran in our Veterans of Foreign War organization here in Bryan, yes.

01:45.614 --> 01:50.741
And I'm 77 years old, so that says something for the guys who are ahead of me.

01:51.042 --> 02:00.876
Now, Dr. Cooper is very quick to point out that he did not serve in direct combat in either World War II or in Korea, but the sailors that he mended along the way are awfully glad that he was there.

02:00.856 --> 02:02.640
You are a practicing physician now.

02:02.660 --> 02:08.151
We're going to talk a little bit about that more later, but I want to talk about your service in World War II in Korea.

02:08.171 --> 02:14.465
You were a young teenager right after VJ Day, and you saw a lot of remnants of the war as a very young man.

02:14.485 --> 02:21.379
Tom, I was 17 when I enlisted and then went to boot camp and was on my way to Japan.

02:21.848 --> 02:26.141
when World War II ended with the dropping of the first aid bomb.

02:26.161 --> 02:31.217
And there are questions that come up about whether or not I'm in favor

02:31.703 --> 02:42.156
of having dropped those two A-bombs, and the answer is always overwhelmingly yes, because had those two bombs not been dropped, I might not have been here.

02:42.256 --> 02:54.572
I would have been in the first invasion forces going into Japan, and it was estimated that there would have been four million casualties had we invaded Japan, three million Japanese and one million

02:54.552 --> 03:04.682
Allied forces and so even though there was a great great sacrifice of life with those two bombs and we wish we had not Had to drop them.

03:04.702 --> 03:06.484
It was a necessary thing.

03:06.724 --> 03:20.858
It was something that saved countless millions of lives And we're sorry that some people had to be sacrificed for that We talked about the remnants of war that you witnessed that you saw I cannot Underestimate the horror that you must have seen.

03:20.898 --> 03:24.542
I know that you were in Nagasaki you were in Wakayama

03:24.927 --> 03:29.267
other places like this to where you really saw what the war did.

03:29.365 --> 03:40.836
By the time I passed by Nagasaki, I never set foot on the ground there, but I was in a city called Wakayama, which was on a little inland from the coast of Japan.

03:41.877 --> 03:47.042
And it was a city of over 100,000 people before the war and during the war.

03:47.063 --> 03:52.788
And the only thing left standing in that city of 100,000 people were the bank vaults.

03:52.808 --> 03:56.672
And the reason they were left was because they were cement and steel.

03:56.652 --> 03:59.836
You went to medical school at the University of Tennessee, I believe?

03:59.896 --> 04:00.256
Correct.

04:00.316 --> 04:05.522
But you had been actually in the Navy both before and after you went to school, is that right?

04:05.763 --> 04:06.704
Correct.

04:06.724 --> 04:17.817
I was an enlisted man during World War II and then came back, went to medical school, and then rejoined the Navy and interned in the Navy and then served in the Atlantic

04:18.168 --> 04:19.129
during the Korean War.

04:19.330 --> 04:20.211
Talk about your service.

04:20.231 --> 04:23.215
The USS Admiral Benson I believe was one of your ships.

04:23.235 --> 04:39.940
That was a very interesting thing from the standpoint of people in Bryan, Texas in that USS Admiral Benson was a Navy transport ship and we boarded the Benson in San Francisco headed for Japan and

04:40.797 --> 04:47.305
On the way to Japan, after about 38 days, we went by both the islands of Iwo Jima.

04:47.465 --> 04:54.933
The battle was already over, of course, in Iwo Jima, but the spoils of war were there and there was just destruction everywhere.

04:56.075 --> 05:01.401
Tanks and cars, trucks and everything just blown to smithereens, airplanes on the beach.

05:01.982 --> 05:04.965
There were ships that were sunk out in the harbor and so forth.

05:05.553 --> 05:07.195
And we just passed by there.

05:07.255 --> 05:10.018
Then we went on to Okinawa and anchored.

05:10.098 --> 05:18.026
But prior to the time that we got to Okinawa, there was a tremendous hurricane, which you would call a tsunami now.

05:18.046 --> 05:24.293
And the USS Admiral Benson was a 20,000 ton ship and it was being tossed around like a matchstick.

05:25.354 --> 05:28.978
And it is of further interest that after I got back to Bryan,

05:29.465 --> 05:40.398
This was in 1945 and then in 1955 I came to Bryan and then about four or five years ago I was talking to a man whose name is George Ferreri here in town.

05:40.518 --> 05:42.561
He's now deceased.

05:42.581 --> 05:47.927
And George let me know that he was on a ship in a typhoon in Okinawa.

05:47.967 --> 05:48.608
I said, when?

05:48.628 --> 05:49.809
He said, in 1945.

05:50.090 --> 05:54.595
I said, I was on a ship in a typhoon in Okinawa in 1945.

05:55.199 --> 05:56.662
And I said, what ship, George?

05:56.682 --> 05:58.345
He said, USS Admiral Benson.

05:58.606 --> 06:01.071
I said, George, I was on the USS Admiral Benson.

06:01.111 --> 06:08.146
So George Ferreri, Travis Bryan, and I were on the same ship in World War II and didn't know it until about five years ago.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.428
The world is smaller than we think.

06:09.508 --> 06:10.310
It's very small.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.232
Absolutely.

06:11.372 --> 06:11.913
Very small.

06:12.014 --> 06:16.583
Now you went to the University of Tennessee, went to medical school there, and then you re-enlisted in the Navy.

06:16.951 --> 06:19.374
And you spent some time at Bethesda in Washington.

06:19.394 --> 06:20.976
That was quite an experience for you.

06:20.996 --> 06:32.390
It was a most delightful experience in that you saw all the major naval characters from World War II who were still alive.

06:32.490 --> 06:36.776
At one time, we had three five-star admirals in the hospital.

06:36.816 --> 06:40.600
There was Halsey, Halstead, and Nimitz were all there at one time.

06:40.620 --> 06:44.325
Well, there were four because Admiral King actually lived in the hospital.

06:45.048 --> 06:54.484
and Cordell Hull was there, the Secretary of State who met the two Japanese representatives before Pearl Harbor or after Pearl Harbor had occurred.

06:55.004 --> 06:59.450
And it was just a parade of historic characters through that hospital.

07:00.952 --> 07:08.942
Since this was in 1952, World War II was not that far away, and there were still a lot of people alive who served in World War II.

07:09.803 --> 07:13.288
And Shirley Temple was even a patient there while I was there.

07:13.528 --> 07:14.389
What rank were you then?

07:14.790 --> 07:18.315
I was a Lieutenant J.G., not the lowest guy on the totem pole.

07:18.395 --> 07:23.582
And you're giving physicals to Nimitz and Halsey and folks like that.

07:23.642 --> 07:23.982
What...

07:24.468 --> 07:25.990
That had to be a little intimidating.

07:26.070 --> 07:35.905
This was very intimidating when you would walk into the room and here'd be a man with two stars, three stars, four stars, and five stars.

07:35.925 --> 07:41.193
And here I am, a lowly Lieutenant J.G., and I thought, my God, what in the world am I doing here?

07:41.593 --> 07:49.845
So yes, it was intimidating, but now that I look back and reflect on it, it was the most interesting part of my life, and I cherish it.

07:49.865 --> 07:52.990
Of course, to them, at that moment, you were their doctor, not just a doctor.

07:53.628 --> 07:57.313
a young up-and-coming naval guy.

07:57.473 --> 07:58.575
You were their doctor at the time.

07:58.675 --> 08:04.683
I was not their primary doctor, but I was the lowest guy on the totem pole, so I had to do the physical exams.

08:05.043 --> 08:09.229
You talked about in the Korean War, you spent your time with the Atlantic fleet.

08:09.429 --> 08:11.572
In the North Atlantic, yes.

08:11.592 --> 08:23.247
At the time I was aboard destroyers, I was a destroyer squadron medical officer, and I had eight destroyers, and I could ride on any one of the destroyers that I wanted to.

08:23.699 --> 08:36.445
One of the destroyers you would recognize, it was called the USS The Sullivans, and it was named after the five brothers who died during World War II, I think on a cruiser, but I'm not sure.

08:37.226 --> 08:43.058
They sank on a cruiser and all were killed during World War II, and so they named this ship.

08:43.038 --> 08:47.963
So that was one famous ship that was in that particular squadron that I happened to be in.

08:48.383 --> 08:54.990
You told me once about an experience that you'll never forget involving the USS Bennington, an explosion.

08:55.010 --> 09:05.480
Tom, during World War II, all of the catapults on carriers, there were no catapults on the carriers during World War II except toward the end.

09:05.540 --> 09:12.167
And the USS Bennington was a carrier that had been built toward the end of World War II and then upgraded.

09:12.822 --> 09:17.248
And these catapults are the things that launch airplanes off these ships.

09:17.548 --> 09:20.271
You see them on all carriers now.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.374
And they were all hydraulically operated.

09:22.815 --> 09:26.359
And they were launching airplanes right at dawn.

09:26.379 --> 09:29.543
And this is the time that all the officers were in the wardroom eating.

09:30.244 --> 09:34.209
Both the doctors on the Bennington were in that wardroom eating.

09:34.229 --> 09:36.232
And this catapult had a leak in it.

09:36.252 --> 09:37.273
And fumes formed.

09:37.313 --> 09:39.296
Hydraulic fluid fumes formed.

09:39.316 --> 09:42.660
It went through the ventilation system and was ignited.

09:43.248 --> 10:00.413
and killed 103 people instantly, and we got 285 or six severely, severely burned patients from the USS Bennington in about six or seven hours after that accident happened at the Newport Naval Hospital.

10:00.967 --> 10:11.217
I was not stationed at the Newport Naval Hospital, but I was on destroyers in the bay, so they took all the physicians off the ships in the bay and put us over at the Newport Naval Hospital.

10:11.898 --> 10:18.245
And here come these helicopters with these severely, severely burned men from the Bennington.

10:18.545 --> 10:26.653
Both doctors were killed during the initial explosion, so all they had was the corpsmen who did a marvelous job taking care of them.

10:26.954 --> 10:35.510
airlifted them back into us and it was a very very difficult time in my life and one that I certainly wouldn't want to relive again.

10:35.530 --> 10:37.814
Talk about the Korean War.

10:38.516 --> 10:50.498
There's so much romance involved and there's so many movies involved involving World War II and there's so much right now so much credit and adulation given to what they call the greatest generation of World War II.

10:50.866 --> 10:54.891
The Korean War kind of snuck in there in the late 40s and the early 50s.

10:54.951 --> 11:02.780
It maybe doesn't get the press or get the ink that World War II does as far as our education of wars today.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.662
But you were part of that Korean War.

11:04.763 --> 11:09.688
Talk a little bit about that war, what it meant to you as a veteran and what it meant to America.

11:10.209 --> 11:17.818
Tom, as I've pointed out to you on many occasions before, as far as I know, I never had a bullet shot at me.

11:18.406 --> 11:23.532
And during the Korean War, I was on a submarine patrol in the North Atlantic on these destroyers.

11:24.534 --> 11:32.183
And you mentioned different wars, Iraqi War, Desert Storm, Vietnam, Korea, World War II.

11:32.824 --> 11:39.732
If a bullet hits you, it's the same as if it were the Civil War, World War II, Korea.

11:39.752 --> 11:47.822
So I've always said to these groups of students that I go and talk to periodically, war is not pretty.

11:48.393 --> 11:49.855
and there is no pretty war.

11:50.056 --> 12:01.074
There are romantic wars, but when you get down to the nit and gritty grind and the daily chores that these guys do from day to day, none of it is very pretty.

12:01.094 --> 12:14.957
So all wars are very similar in that people are maimed, people are taken away from their homes, people's homes are destroyed, countries are destroyed, and their governments are uprooted,

12:14.937 --> 12:25.473
It's just a destructive, destructive thing, and we need to learn to live in the world in a different way rather than going to war with each other.

12:25.493 --> 12:27.816
And that's a thought that a lot of people have today.

12:28.177 --> 12:34.246
As we look at what's happening in Iraq, there's obviously there are people that don't think that we should be there.

12:34.286 --> 12:39.474
There's people that think that we should, that we have to fight terrorism on every front.

12:39.494 --> 12:42.919
I guess there's obviously things to be said for both arguments.

12:43.608 --> 12:45.150
Without getting too deep, what's your thoughts?

12:45.370 --> 12:53.360
Tom, terrorism, of course, is on my mind all the time as it is on a lot of people's minds nowadays.

12:53.541 --> 13:05.716
And it's a war that probably can never really be won in that this is like saying you're going to stamp out crime in the whole world.

13:05.736 --> 13:07.498
We have large police forces.

13:07.619 --> 13:11.944
We have people who try to do this and they do a good job.

13:12.599 --> 13:23.557
But you don't ever stamp it all out, so there's always going to be a need for somebody in the United States and all the other countries in the world to be ready to go to war.

13:23.838 --> 13:30.349
Let's just hope that we don't have to go and be involved on the basis that we are now.

13:30.950 --> 13:37.240
Certainly no criticism, and certainly I really, really love the troops in Iraq, and I

13:37.220 --> 13:43.772
My heart goes out to them and I honor them and certainly thank them from the bottom of my heart for being there.

13:44.072 --> 13:45.214
I know what they're going through.

13:45.615 --> 13:53.329
It's certainly a different kind of battle, obviously, because when you were fighting or when you were involved in World War II in Korea, we knew the enemy.

13:53.349 --> 13:54.992
We knew the weapons that they held.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.180
We don't know what's coming up to hit us in the back.

13:58.801 --> 14:11.616
The guy coming down the street, and I just saw this day before yesterday, I think, was in a police uniform and gained access to this police compound and had a bomb on him and blew himself up.

14:12.196 --> 14:25.131
So yes, the answer is that they're fighting an unknown enemy, really, and it makes it very, very difficult for them to identify and to have plans to fight even.

14:25.111 --> 14:28.436
How do you plan against somebody you don't even know who you're fighting against?

14:28.456 --> 14:28.877
Exactly.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.061
Let's lighten it up a little bit.

14:31.101 --> 14:33.445
Let's go to 1954.

14:34.727 --> 14:38.833
I guess you retired from the active service and you went into the reserves at that time.

14:39.334 --> 14:41.698
Talk about that and how you found your way to Bryan, Texas.

14:41.818 --> 14:52.215
Actually, it was your brother, Dr. O.C. Cooper, a beloved physician in this town who we lost not too long ago, who actually found Bryan College Station before you did.

14:52.347 --> 14:52.847
O.C.

14:52.948 --> 14:56.891
was drafted actually into the Air Force.

14:57.051 --> 14:58.152
He was in the U.S.

14:58.292 --> 15:03.456
Army during World War II and was in medical school actually during most of World War II.

15:04.097 --> 15:11.383
And then got out and then during the Korean War was drafted back into the Air Force and was stationed at Bryan Air Force Base.

15:12.684 --> 15:14.506
I got out of the Navy before O.C.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.428
got out of the Air Force and I was looking for a place to practice.

15:17.448 --> 15:18.529
So I came to Bryan.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.932
There had been about a five or six year drought here.

15:22.469 --> 15:27.055
The ground was all cracked open, the grass was brown, and the cattle were dying.

15:27.155 --> 15:31.761
And I looked at Brian and I said, my gosh, who would live there?

15:31.781 --> 15:35.726
And I turned around and drove back to Illinois and went to Portland, Oregon.

15:35.746 --> 15:38.250
And it rained 365 days.

15:38.650 --> 15:41.334
And I said, my gosh, I know a place that's dry.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.136
And I came back to Brian.

15:43.156 --> 15:44.178
And you've been here ever since?

15:44.198 --> 15:46.080
Been here ever since 1955.

15:46.567 --> 15:47.788
Talk a little bit about your practice.

15:47.808 --> 15:49.309
You're a practicing physician.

15:49.329 --> 15:51.151
You see patients every day.

15:51.171 --> 15:51.932
Every day.

15:52.392 --> 15:57.516
And also, you serve as an aviation medical examiner, senior aviation medical examiner.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.218
Talk a little bit about that role.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.741
If you want to be a pilot and you live in this town, you've got to go through Jim Cooper.

16:02.761 --> 16:03.101
Is that right?

16:03.121 --> 16:16.573
Well, you don't have to go to me because there are two other guys here in town who do physicals, but I'm a senior aviation medical examiner, which means that I do examine airline transport pilots or commercial pilots, you would call them.

16:16.553 --> 16:39.675
and I do a lot of pilots from out of town even who have been here in school and then when they've gone off and gotten jobs with the airlines they keep coming back here for their physicals and yes this is an interesting job you meet a lot of interesting people and I think that maybe you may allude to one of them later on during our conversation.

16:39.942 --> 16:43.848
A lot of young men and young women who want to be pilots.

16:43.868 --> 16:45.170
So you meet a lot of these people.

16:45.210 --> 16:51.621
So you can give them, I guess, a little bit of advice about what it takes also besides being their medical guy.

16:51.961 --> 16:57.510
Tom, I've seen people start out from the zero point in their flying.

16:57.530 --> 17:02.338
And during the Vietnam War, I had people who came through A&M.

17:02.690 --> 17:11.803
took their private pilots training at the Eastwood Airport, went on into the Air Force, and then went into combat in Vietnam.

17:11.823 --> 17:17.952
There were several of them that I had watched grow and go into combat from Texas A&M.

17:18.072 --> 17:22.619
You've probably given those type of exams to folks and then their kids too, right?

17:22.639 --> 17:23.280
Absolutely.

17:23.700 --> 17:27.005
Don't want to talk about your age, but you've probably seen a few generations.

17:27.025 --> 17:28.067
Tom, I'm not ashamed.

17:28.087 --> 17:29.068
I'm 77.

17:29.487 --> 17:32.612
but still one of the youngest World War II veterans around this valley, right?

17:32.652 --> 17:33.353
Absolutely.

17:33.834 --> 17:34.415
Absolutely.

17:36.899 --> 17:39.944
Fascinating career just here in Bryan College Station.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.768
I want to talk about a couple of things.

17:42.968 --> 17:45.893
You have a relationship, a friendship, and you knew

17:46.092 --> 17:51.557
Dr. Werner Von Braun, and that's quite a historical figure.

17:51.597 --> 17:53.939
Talk a little bit about how you knew the doctor.

17:54.400 --> 18:00.986
Tom, I was privileged through my flying to have known a man in Dallas by the name of J.R.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.628
Maxfield who was a physician.

18:03.648 --> 18:13.517
He was a nuclear science pioneer in medicine, and he and Dr. Von Braun were very, very good friends, and through Dr. Maxfield,

18:13.970 --> 18:20.724
I attended all the Apollo launches, seven through 17, and we were two and a half miles from launch.

18:20.805 --> 18:26.978
And in going to the Cape, I met a lot of the German scientists, one of whom happened to be Dr. Von Braun.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.363
Dr. Von Braun was a pilot.

18:29.917 --> 18:37.397
And Dr. Von Braun needed a physical exam on one or two occasions, and I was privileged to be able to do his aviation physical exam for him.

18:37.598 --> 18:38.981
We just put up a picture.

18:39.021 --> 18:40.967
I don't know if we can put that back up on the screen.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.411
It was a photograph.

18:42.431 --> 18:44.095
There it is right there, Jim.

18:44.530 --> 18:47.497
that he autographed for you, this hangs on your wall in your office.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.103
It does, and I'm very, very proud of it, Tom.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.346
Very proud.

18:51.366 --> 18:56.838
Those are all the Saturn rockets behind him that launched our major satellites.

18:57.099 --> 19:01.830
And the Saturn V launched the vehicles that went to the moon.

19:02.401 --> 19:05.327
and thus your involvement also with the space program.

19:05.347 --> 19:09.175
I understand that you saw, what, nine or 10 Apollo launches.

19:09.195 --> 19:09.756
Is that right?

19:09.776 --> 19:12.120
You saw them, and what was your involvement with that?

19:12.461 --> 19:15.828
Well, seven through 17, so there were 10 launches.

19:15.848 --> 19:17.912
All manned Apollo flights, I was there.

19:18.584 --> 19:36.964
Up until Apollo 11, I was just an observer, and during Apollo 11, I met some Australian newsmen, and since there were no satellites in Western Australia, or there were no satellites in orbit then for transmission of radio and television signals,

19:37.332 --> 19:52.415
They did not have live coverage of the Apollo program in Western Australia, so they contracted with me to do a phone-type presentation of the launch from the Cape to their studio in Perth, Australia.

19:52.435 --> 20:00.087
So I gave a voice commentary of the Apollo launches 12 through 17 to Perth, Australia.

20:01.109 --> 20:01.990
That's outstanding.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.133
Let's bring it back here home.

20:04.533 --> 20:16.794
Texas World Speedway is down the road, and when they were really blowing and going and holding the races, they were very strong for a long time, and then they sort of went away for a while and then came back about eight or nine years ago.

20:16.814 --> 20:21.962
But you were involved with Texas World Speedway as their main medical man.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.505
Talk a little bit about that involvement.

20:23.603 --> 20:35.016
time I was, except for the first two races they had there, I was involved in every major race up until near the end that they had.

20:35.397 --> 20:43.126
This was both Indy cars and NASCARs and stock cars that raced below the NASCAR level.

20:44.247 --> 20:48.312
And I did meet some interesting people out there, had some interesting experiences.

20:48.292 --> 20:49.293
There's one right now.

20:49.333 --> 20:55.462
As a matter of fact, we're looking at, I think people, anybody that knows anything about racing knows that gentleman on the left, AJ Foyt.

20:55.502 --> 20:56.283
Remember that picture?

20:56.323 --> 20:57.845
What were you talking to him about?

20:57.865 --> 21:09.300
AJ had just, he was in an Indy car and he had just backed into the wall during about 190 miles an hour and they brought him, it was a rule that they had to come to the hospital after they'd had an accident.

21:09.320 --> 21:16.189
They brought him down to the hospital and he had a huge scrape on his helmet, which indicated his helmet had scraped along the wall.

21:16.726 --> 21:22.197
and I was concerned about the fact that he might have a head injury even though he was up walking around talking.

21:22.700 --> 21:33.676
I told the powers that be that I didn't think he should drive in the next race, which was a stock car race, and he was talking to the people up in the tower telling him he was going to drive in that race.

21:34.096 --> 21:35.578
He did drive in the race.

21:36.219 --> 21:38.683
After the race, he did not remember driving in the race.

21:39.404 --> 21:42.448
So you all had a little bit of a difference of opinion when that picture was taken.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.810
We did have, but A.J.

21:43.850 --> 21:45.352
prevailed.

21:45.773 --> 21:47.475
He drove in the race.

21:47.455 --> 21:49.538
That probably doesn't surprise you.

21:49.598 --> 21:50.059
Not at all.

21:50.079 --> 21:55.666
He's known as a man of his own thoughts, and he'll listen to your advice, but not always take it.

21:55.686 --> 21:56.948
He won't take it.

21:56.968 --> 22:02.776
He has his own book of advice that he reads and does things on his own all the time.

22:02.796 --> 22:07.843
Jim, I know you're very involved as a past commander of the VFW post here in Bryan College Station.

22:08.178 --> 22:12.503
Talk a little bit about what your involvement is with that organization.

22:12.603 --> 22:19.511
Obviously it's a wonderful organization, one that is home to a lot of our older and younger veterans.

22:20.052 --> 22:31.705
Tom, I wish that the younger veterans would become more active and we as the older leaders in that organization should recruit these young men because

22:31.685 --> 22:37.937
The Veterans of Foreign Wars has on their agenda many, many, many civic programs.

22:38.017 --> 22:43.648
We sponsor kids in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.

22:43.708 --> 22:50.601
They have a program called the Voice of the Patriot's Pen where they write a little essay.

22:50.621 --> 22:55.009
And I was just over at the Caldwell Post not long ago and they presented

22:55.343 --> 23:01.710
the winner with a $500 check, the second place person got a $250.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.073
No, it was $1,500 and $250.

23:06.094 --> 23:11.160
And here we give war bonds to these people that write these essays.

23:11.180 --> 23:18.047
Then the juniors and seniors in high school participate in a program called the Voice of Democracy.

23:18.848 --> 23:22.532
And these kids, the guy, the child who won the

23:22.917 --> 23:31.645
National program about three years ago got a $75,000 scholarship from the VFW.

23:31.665 --> 23:34.107
We do a lot of things with the scouts.

23:34.127 --> 23:37.951
We go to schools promoting patriotism.

23:37.991 --> 23:44.657
We just came from Hammond Oliver School this past week doing history of World War II.

23:44.757 --> 23:50.562
The lady who taught the history class wanted us there to give a hands on.

23:50.542 --> 23:59.638
And it was just delightful to talk to these kids and tell them a little bit about the history of the armed forces during World War II, Korea.

23:59.658 --> 24:01.842
And then we had Vietnam veterans there.

24:02.283 --> 24:04.146
We had one Desert Storm veteran there.

24:04.687 --> 24:09.055
So the VFW organism is not a static organism.

24:09.075 --> 24:11.740
It's a viable, energetic organism.

24:11.720 --> 24:25.709
that we do support youth, we support many, many civic projects, we support patriotism, and there are a lot of activities that we would like to promote in the community.

24:25.729 --> 24:29.577
It's got to please you, I would think, that in this day of our education,

24:29.911 --> 24:43.196
concentrating so much on technology and modern technology and where they're going with that, that you have teachers that call you up and say, hey, we don't want our kids to forget what happened 50, 60 years ago and the people who made that happen.

24:43.717 --> 24:48.105
You've got to only hope that that's still going to be the case 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the road.

24:49.469 --> 25:07.275
There is no better way for these kids to learn than to talk to some of us, and their eyes just become widened when we show them pictures of us in our Navy uniforms, and there was one man who had some Auschwitz,

25:07.255 --> 25:10.779
prison camp pictures and I think he's going to be on your program.

25:10.799 --> 25:12.341
So I won't steal his thunder.

25:12.361 --> 25:12.822
That's right.

25:12.842 --> 25:26.058
But when you have hands on things like this and when you're talking to these kids directly and they're asking you questions that are not answered in the history books and you can tell them of your experiences, this means a lot more to them.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.880
It is

25:28.366 --> 25:38.661
indelibilized on their mind a lot more than it would be if they saw a picture in a history book that had no bearing on anybody or anything that they knew anything about.

25:38.681 --> 25:49.036
So I think we do a good job in giving our point of view from the person who was there during the event that was occurring at that time.

25:49.838 --> 25:50.599
And they've got their eyes open.

25:50.619 --> 25:53.563
We weren't there for the crucifixion.

25:53.543 --> 25:57.968
And they've got their eyes open and they're listening and they're trying their best to understand and they're absorbing it.

25:57.988 --> 25:58.933
And that's what's important.

25:58.954 --> 26:01.005
Jim, we've got a couple of minutes left.

26:01.745 --> 26:28.478
Sum up what does it what does it mean to Dr. Jim Cooper to be a a veteran, an American veteran. First time I'm proud to have served. Second is I look around and I see young men and I pray and I hope that things can be worked out in this world where the horrors that some of the other people went through that I didn't have to go through even though I was in the armed forces,

26:29.723 --> 26:32.287
I hope that these young men don't have to do this.

26:32.547 --> 26:41.180
There are better ways to settle world problems than shooting at each other, maiming each other, destroying your cities, destroying your bodies.

26:42.482 --> 26:48.992
And we need to meet on some common ground somewhere that will prevent this from happening.

26:49.012 --> 26:56.423
And certainly the World War IIs, the Vietnams, the Koreas, the desert storms, our action in Iraq now,

26:57.078 --> 26:59.103
There has to be a better way.

26:59.123 --> 27:02.150
We as human beings are smart enough to go to the moon.

27:02.170 --> 27:09.308
We ought to be smart enough to find a way out to be veterans of world peace and not foreign wars.

27:10.430 --> 27:12.716
Dr. Jim Cooper, thank you for being with us today.

27:12.796 --> 27:14.741
We thank you very much for your service.

27:14.761 --> 27:15.222
Thank you.

27:15.691 --> 27:21.718
Dr. Jim Cooper is one of the many proud members of the greatest generation that we treasure here in the Brazos Valley.

27:22.279 --> 27:26.363
And he and many others help keep the spirit of our veterans alive.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.146
We salute Dr. Jim Cooper and all the veterans of the Brazos Valley.

27:29.727 --> 27:30.808
Thank you for your service.

27:31.089 --> 27:36.675
And please do not forget the next chance you get to always thank a vet.

27:36.695 --> 27:38.417
Do it every day.

27:38.437 --> 27:40.960
For Dr. Jim Cooper, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:40.980 --> 27:41.921
Thank you for joining us.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.162
Thanks for watching.

27:43.423 --> 27:44.584
We'll see you the next time

27:45.037 --> 27:46.580
on Veterans of the Valley.

27:47.000 --> 27:57.000
[Music.]

27:57.000 --> 28:11.000
[Music.]
