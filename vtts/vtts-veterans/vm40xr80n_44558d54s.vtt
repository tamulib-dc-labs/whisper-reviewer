Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.585 --> 00:32.687
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.528 --> 00:46.004
After LeRoy Schoenemann graduated from Snook High School in 1941, he wanted more out of life, and it was those sounds and sights of aircraft over his head that inspired him to be a flyer.

00:46.024 --> 00:50.450
He entered the Army Air Corps and was fast-tracked to the war in the Pacific.

00:50.570 --> 01:00.143
First stop Guadalcanal as a member of the 64th Troop Carrier Squadron, piloting C-47s just about everywhere and carrying just about everything.

01:00.545 --> 01:05.934
He eventually went to C-47s, from C-47s to B-47s, and that was quite a leap.

01:06.475 --> 01:12.344
After World War II, he was reactivated and spent most of the Korean War at a lonely outpost in Libya.

01:12.645 --> 01:18.094
It's a fascinating story, and we welcome Lieutenant Colonel LeRoy Schoenemann to Veterans of the Valley.

01:18.474 --> 01:19.716
Welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

01:20.317 --> 01:27.008
LeRoy, I want to get you over to the Pacific here, and you were pretty much fast-tracked after Pearl Harbor.

01:27.393 --> 01:34.741
I think you went to San Antonio and you went around different places for training, but it wasn't long before you were sent to the Pacific, to Guadalcanal.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.183
Sort of talk about that.

01:36.203 --> 01:38.486
Were you ready to move that fast?

01:38.506 --> 01:47.036
No, I didn't know what was going to happen to us because after flying school, less than a month later, I was on a ship headed for the South Pacific.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.198
Landed in New Guinea and

01:49.803 --> 01:58.215
And finally, they flew us over to Guadalcanal at Henderson Field, and there's where I joined my 64 troop carry squadron.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.398
Talk about that squadron and what its job was.

02:00.438 --> 02:02.181
C-47s were haulers.

02:02.241 --> 02:03.863
You all just hauled people.

02:03.903 --> 02:04.644
You hauled things.

02:04.745 --> 02:08.390
Anything that needed to be taken from one place to another, that's what you all did.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.613
Yeah, we were so like a truck line.

02:10.894 --> 02:14.018
Everything that they needed, we hauled from one island to another.

02:14.038 --> 02:19.506
A lot of it was we would take an advanced party up forward, and then the others would get on a boat,

02:20.110 --> 02:26.238
And by the time they got there on the boat, the advance party would sort of have things arranged and set up for them.

02:26.258 --> 02:27.500
We did a lot of that stuff.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.503
But we hauled everything you can imagine.

02:29.623 --> 02:32.266
Anything that could get in the doors that's in there.

02:32.687 --> 02:45.064
Characterize some of those missions for me because there were times, I'm sure, that you flew under good conditions, good weather, but most of them were not good weather because that part of that country, it rained quite a bit.

02:45.084 --> 02:46.365
There was a lot of cloud cover, right?

02:46.806 --> 02:48.328
Yeah, we flew through a lot of

02:48.967 --> 02:55.493
I can't say thunderstorms, because in the tropics you don't have much lightning, but it was pouring rain lots of times.

02:56.233 --> 03:07.323
And fortunately, most of the airfields were built right on the beaches, so that when you found the island, the beaches were open, there was no rain.

03:07.343 --> 03:11.187
The rain was more up in the mountains, and so we could find the thing.

03:11.227 --> 03:15.971
There was no navigational aids or anything like we have nowadays.

03:16.091 --> 03:18.113
It was pretty much

03:18.650 --> 03:19.811
pilots in sight.

03:20.052 --> 03:21.013
Right.

03:21.033 --> 03:22.535
You were your own navigator, pretty much.

03:22.635 --> 03:23.736
We were our own navigators.

03:23.756 --> 03:28.562
We had a few navigators in the squadron, but most flights were done without navigators.

03:28.602 --> 03:29.524
Right.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.486
Talk about specifically some of your missions.

03:31.506 --> 03:33.989
I know that when it was raining, it was wet.

03:34.009 --> 03:35.211
There was a lot of mud involved.

03:35.231 --> 03:36.492
You got stuck in the mud.

03:36.512 --> 03:37.413
Well, yeah.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.456
That happened mostly in the Philippines.

03:39.516 --> 03:45.163
Up until we got in the Philippines, most of the airfields were built for fighters and bombers, and we had to

03:45.532 --> 03:46.774
long, good runways.

03:46.794 --> 03:52.240
We got to the Philippines, they sent us out in little old pre-war strips, I guess.

03:52.481 --> 04:02.233
Most of them were, a lot of them were mud and little gravel and some of them were no runway at all, just mowed down the jungle grass and we landed out there.

04:03.475 --> 04:13.227
And during drop missions, it rained about twice a day and we got so much mud and water and with the doors off to drop the stuff that we got mud inside and out of the airplane.

04:13.409 --> 04:15.871
where all you could about see is the nose of the airplane.

04:16.011 --> 04:20.736
Yeah, when they land in that mud and water, the only thing you could see was the nose of the airplane.

04:21.556 --> 04:23.118
But there's a good old airplane.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.220
I don't think many of them could have took all that stuff.

04:26.461 --> 04:27.902
Right, right.

04:28.202 --> 04:33.547
A lot of the landing strips you talked about at Guadalcanal and other places were actually built by the Navy Seabees, right?

04:33.867 --> 04:36.029
So these were pretty worthy airstrips, right?

04:36.349 --> 04:37.210
Right, yeah.

04:37.631 --> 04:42.555
They needed pretty good airstrips for B-24s and stuff like that.

04:42.670 --> 04:49.203
There was one incident, I don't know when it was during this time, but where you actually did a 180 skid.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.448
Tell us more about that one.

04:51.468 --> 05:02.130
Well, that was another one of those muddy strips, and we were coming to the end of the strip, and we were still doing, I don't know, 40 miles an hour or something, and couldn't stop, so we did...

05:02.785 --> 05:14.466
unlocked the tail wheel and gun one engine and that airplane did a 180 degree turn and sort of slid backwards before it stopped but we didn't run into anything.

05:15.020 --> 05:20.467
We unloaded our stuff, all the army troops around there said, we want to see you do that again.

05:21.829 --> 05:22.650
Only one time.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.492
That's right, you only did that trick once.

05:25.614 --> 05:27.776
And some of the trips, like you said, were quite short.

05:28.838 --> 05:33.183
Sometimes you would have to take off as like 60 miles an hour.

05:34.224 --> 05:35.026
And you can do that.

05:35.046 --> 05:37.609
We call them carrier takeoff.

05:37.629 --> 05:42.495
We run up full throttle and hold the brakes and then

05:42.897 --> 05:45.880
When we got about 40 miles an hour, put down quarter flaps.

05:45.940 --> 05:53.746
And I said, C-47, if you're very gentle with the controls, you could actually ease it off the ground at about 60 miles an hour.

05:54.387 --> 05:59.711
And slowly gain enough speed to get climb speed.

05:59.731 --> 06:04.635
When you got to Guadalcanal, you had never flown a C-47 before.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.278
You sort of taught by observing, right?

06:08.298 --> 06:09.019
Right.

06:09.039 --> 06:12.702
And just like I say, OJT, flying with the other crews until we

06:13.373 --> 06:14.715
Saw what was going on.

06:14.735 --> 06:17.180
And then just sort of figured it out.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.463
How big were the crews that you normally flew with?

06:19.924 --> 06:21.667
They only had pilot and co-pilot.

06:21.687 --> 06:23.731
They were crew chiefs and a radio operator.

06:26.235 --> 06:27.417
You hauled tents.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.780
You hauled jeeps.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.244
You hauled... And you also did medevac.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.225
Is that right?

06:32.246 --> 06:32.626
Right.

06:32.646 --> 06:34.409
In the Philippines, we did a lot of medevac.

06:34.429 --> 06:35.191
A lot of medevac.

06:35.231 --> 06:36.613
In other words, taking...

06:36.880 --> 06:55.868
taking troops injured troops out till they could be transferred to hospitals is that right well we went I think they had these little hospitals at these little strips and we brought them more to the the main hospitals and Philippines

06:57.772 --> 07:06.745
the army was scattered out more to all the islands where in the other ones they would take a perimeter or they would take an island and then they would move on.

07:08.107 --> 07:14.456
But in the Philippines, of course there were thousands of islands out there and I think it covered all of them.

07:16.079 --> 07:25.753
I don't think people sometimes get a really good grip of the span of time, the short span of time, especially for you from when you were just a kid on the farm in Chinook, Texas.

07:26.375 --> 07:31.943
to flying a troop transport plane, a C-47, in World War II.

07:32.584 --> 07:33.525
What were your thoughts then?

07:33.545 --> 07:37.550
Because you were still a young, young man, and you had quite a responsibility.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.574
I don't know that we even thought about that.

07:41.996 --> 07:46.543
They told us what to do, and we went and did it, and we liked to do it.

07:48.405 --> 07:51.910
Like I say,

07:52.531 --> 07:59.100
I look back on it and I can't remember any time when you were fearful or anything like that, you know.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.282
So were you scared?

08:01.322 --> 08:01.743
Were you scared?

08:01.763 --> 08:07.030
Were there ever any times that you thought, oh, this is going to be a pretty tight pit here?

08:07.230 --> 08:13.478
I've been in some of them rainstorms when I thought, I hope we get through this thing, you know, pretty soon.

08:13.578 --> 08:16.682
And usually 30 minutes or so you break out.

08:16.702 --> 08:17.303
Right.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.968
I've had World War II pilots tell me that

08:21.691 --> 08:35.009
The order of concern that they have is third would be the enemy, second would be a mechanical problem, but their biggest concern was weather because that was so unpredictable.

08:35.029 --> 08:35.309
Is that?

08:36.791 --> 08:43.260
Yeah, I'd say the weather was, but I don't remember being

08:43.578 --> 08:44.299
too fearful.

08:44.319 --> 08:48.065
I guess being young, you don't worry about too much of that stuff.

08:48.085 --> 08:49.226
Right.

08:49.246 --> 08:50.228
Right.

08:50.248 --> 08:59.101
I referred to this a moment ago, but one time you walked to your plane and it was loaded down, four inch pipe, about 20 foot, four inch pipe.

08:59.181 --> 09:02.546
So that might have went over the weight limit a little.

09:02.566 --> 09:04.950
I think most of the times we were over the weight limit.

09:05.691 --> 09:09.737
But that was one time I remember because it

09:10.291 --> 09:13.675
just floored me to see that thing half full of pipe like that.

09:14.696 --> 09:15.897
But it flew.

09:16.498 --> 09:16.738
Right.

09:19.120 --> 09:30.532
You told me about some experiences that you had, that you had some pretty strange experiences leading up to going into the service and during the service.

09:30.933 --> 09:37.720
Some of those that you recall that you were telling me about the other day.

09:37.740 --> 09:38.661
Well,

09:39.907 --> 09:45.379
I wanted to fly, and I was in the cotton field and seeing them airplanes coming on.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.502
I said, there's a lot better.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.568
I'd rather be doing that than picking this cotton.

09:49.889 --> 09:50.109
Right.

09:50.831 --> 09:54.439
And I had no idea.

09:54.706 --> 10:07.458
I'd never have the chance, but I guess as time went on and the Air Corps lowered their requirements to where you could take a test and go in the aviation cadet program.

10:07.518 --> 10:11.702
So I went to San Antonio and somehow passed the test.

10:11.722 --> 10:16.067
Now, before all that, you were involved in a National Youth Association, a CCC.

10:16.087 --> 10:18.649
We've talked about that on this show before, about a CCC.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.651
Explain exactly what that is.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.692
Well, this was not

10:21.858 --> 10:23.341
Exactly, the CCC.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.484
It's like a CCC.

10:24.504 --> 10:29.193
Yeah, it was called the National Youth Association Administration, I guess.

10:29.815 --> 10:36.188
And they had a, I went to Inks Lake and they had a camp there and they had

10:36.944 --> 10:50.460
guy there who was rebuilding a Aronca and there was three or four of us that were interested in airplanes so we went and helped him and then we rebuilt that Aronca.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.845
He did a lot of work except for us doing a lot of sanding and stuff.

10:55.165 --> 11:02.614
But after Pearl Harbor they started closing down all these things and they sent me to

11:03.421 --> 11:04.642
Carpus Christi.

11:04.662 --> 11:06.324
At the Naval Air Station.

11:06.344 --> 11:07.446
At the Naval Air Station.

11:07.466 --> 11:14.634
And I worked in the engine overhaul department down there until, I guess, 1942.

11:14.914 --> 11:18.418
Right.

11:19.059 --> 11:23.604
You were working on the F2Fs, the biplanes by Grumman, right?

11:23.624 --> 11:23.864
Oh, yeah.

11:24.285 --> 11:30.492
Oh, biplane Grumman, who had the right engines in them.

11:30.877 --> 11:32.000
Sound like a bumblebee.

11:33.383 --> 11:34.405
Looked like a bumblebee.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.848
Right, right.

11:36.550 --> 11:45.190
They made you all civil service, and you worked there until November of 42, and then you said you went to San Antonio and you took the test?

11:45.592 --> 11:54.388
Yeah, I went and took the test before I quit, but then when I passed the test, I think I worked until about December before Christmas, and I decided to go home.

11:54.408 --> 11:59.798
Right, this was aviation cadet training program, and they swore you in the same day.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.401
You passed the test, and they swore you in.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.685
Everything was being fast-tracked about now, right?

12:03.665 --> 12:05.588
I couldn't believe it.

12:06.008 --> 12:08.792
I guess they just looked at us, no physical, no nothing.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.156
They just swore us in.

12:11.176 --> 12:13.579
You were at Stillwater, Oklahoma.

12:14.741 --> 12:16.743
You took some education classes there, right?

12:17.084 --> 12:17.184
Yeah.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.347
Took physics for the first time there, right?

12:19.367 --> 12:29.301
Yeah, after basic training at Shepherd Field, they sent us up to Stillwater to what they call the college training detachment, and they taught us a lot of math.

12:29.821 --> 12:35.930
and physics and, of course, still a lot of marching and stuff like that.

12:35.950 --> 12:40.737
But that helped me a lot, I think, because I never had physics at Snook High School.

12:42.239 --> 12:46.045
You went to pre-flight in San Antonio, then to bottom for primary in the PT-19.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.627
That was the open cockpit plane.

12:47.962 --> 12:51.909
Basic in Greenville and then the Twin Engine Advance at Ellington Field.

12:51.929 --> 13:02.347
So, and they told you it'd be about six months, but ended up being pretty quick that, like we said, that you were off to California and to Stoneman, is that right?

13:02.427 --> 13:03.048
Camp.

13:03.068 --> 13:06.414
Yeah, Stoneman Camp and then to New Guinea and then you were there.

13:07.476 --> 13:07.856
Yeah.

13:07.876 --> 13:09.599
Let's look at some pictures that we've got here.

13:09.660 --> 13:12.805
Some of these are some pictures that you supplied.

13:13.713 --> 13:17.217
for us, and boy, there's a young flyer right there.

13:17.878 --> 13:19.940
How old were you in that picture?

13:19.960 --> 13:23.364
Oh, that was, I was 19, I guess, there.

13:24.385 --> 13:25.506
Was that during training?

13:25.566 --> 13:37.780
Yeah, that was primary training in Bonham, and we were up there probably in fall of 43, and yeah.

13:37.800 --> 13:42.505
Now there you are, peering out of the pilot seat of a C-47.

13:43.025 --> 13:48.690
I'm not sure exactly where that was taken, but that's a C-47.

13:49.351 --> 13:54.536
C-47, I guess, for more modern day, would be what we see as like the Convair.

13:55.076 --> 13:55.557
Is that right?

13:55.617 --> 13:57.058
Sort of like the Convair airplane?

13:57.098 --> 13:59.641
Convair is much more modern.

13:59.701 --> 14:04.645
This was a DC-3 that the Air Force made over.

14:04.786 --> 14:05.726
Right, DC-3.

14:09.190 --> 14:10.551
Talk about this one.

14:11.307 --> 14:15.294
That's me and my crew answering an alert in a B-47.

14:15.494 --> 14:19.360
And you're the one that's climbing up the steps?

14:19.380 --> 14:25.110
I'm climbing the ladder and the co-pilot's behind me and the navigators behind him.

14:25.811 --> 14:30.919
Now was this an actual event here or was this staged for the magazine?

14:33.818 --> 14:34.278
I don't know.

14:34.519 --> 14:35.880
I think it was probably staged.

14:35.960 --> 14:42.867
Okay, because the next picture that you're going to see is this same picture, and it was used actually on a telephone directory at MacDill, right?

14:42.887 --> 14:42.987
Yeah.

14:44.129 --> 14:47.092
Yeah, so that's why I think it was probably staged.

14:47.432 --> 14:51.396
So people had your picture in their drawers and next to their telephones.

14:51.416 --> 15:00.786
I'm sure we were on alert, but we probably did this with a camera one, because you can see an alert vehicle in the background there.

15:00.806 --> 15:00.906
Yeah.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.024
It looks like you're smiling going up the steps.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.310
This is you and your wife, Barbara.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.536
You lost your wife last year, Barbara.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.744
But I know that you all were married for a long time.

15:11.784 --> 15:15.553
Do you remember what this, I think she's receiving some sort of an award that you're presenting to her.

15:15.668 --> 15:16.950
No, that's not me.

15:17.030 --> 15:18.252
That's the base commander.

15:18.272 --> 15:18.973
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:19.053 --> 15:19.814
OK, OK.

15:19.854 --> 15:21.376
That's your wife, commander.

15:21.797 --> 15:22.998
That's your wife and the commander.

15:23.279 --> 15:25.001
And she's receiving an award.

15:25.021 --> 15:26.944
Yeah.

15:26.964 --> 15:28.586
I don't remember what it was for.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.930
I don't know whether it's said in the book or not.

15:31.590 --> 15:32.692
What was she doing during the war?

15:35.055 --> 15:36.157
During World War II?

15:36.197 --> 15:41.104
Oh, she was a student working in Providence, Rhode Island.

15:41.264 --> 15:41.785
Oh, is that right?

15:42.286 --> 15:42.386
Yeah.

15:42.406 --> 15:42.786
That's right.

15:42.806 --> 15:43.888
Because you had not met her yet.

15:43.948 --> 15:45.490
Is that right?

15:45.757 --> 15:49.383
I mean, you had not met her while you were there during the war.

15:49.403 --> 15:52.647
I didn't meet her until I was at Otis for 1952.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.250
Right, right.

15:54.771 --> 15:57.835
This is from a magazine.

15:57.895 --> 16:00.379
Talk about this and why were you the flying crew of the month?

16:02.002 --> 16:07.029
Well, this is my crew and we were on a B-52 evaluation flight.

16:07.090 --> 16:11.376
We had four more evaluators with us when we had

16:12.200 --> 16:23.319
a fire warning light in the number one engine, and it didn't go out, so we had to shut down the number two engine, and so then we had to burn off fuel and land.

16:23.339 --> 16:28.228
We ended up shutting down four engines because the oil pressure just went to zero.

16:28.768 --> 16:29.830
It's four out of six.

16:30.111 --> 16:30.852
Four out of eight.

16:31.072 --> 16:32.876
Four out of eight, excuse me.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.859
You're on the far left of this picture.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.081
Right.

16:36.567 --> 16:41.615
Of course, you can't dump any fuel, and we're way too heavy to land, so we have to burn it up.

16:41.695 --> 16:51.890
And with four engines shut down, it took us about five hours, I guess, to burn up fuel enough to be light enough to land without running off the other end of the runway.

16:52.030 --> 16:55.015
Anyhow, everything ended up fine.

16:55.923 --> 17:08.939
finally found out that it had a fuel leak in a number one nacelle and exploded and blew off about six by four foot piece of cowling underneath the thing.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.623
But that's B-47.

17:14.565 --> 17:16.508
That's quite a different airplane than the C-47.

17:17.109 --> 17:25.018
It was a state of the art airplane, but very, very tricky to fly.

17:25.623 --> 17:28.756
You had to pay attention to it all the time.

17:28.776 --> 17:30.263
It was fast.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.456
In fact, it could out run F-86 at altitude.

17:36.052 --> 17:38.396
It's a magnificent looking plane.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.799
This is another picture of my crew in a B-47.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.424
Do you remember where that was taken?

17:43.484 --> 17:44.645
I know it's been a long time.

17:44.665 --> 17:45.687
That's at McDill.

17:45.767 --> 17:46.368
Is it McDill?

17:47.470 --> 17:49.553
You're on the left in that picture?

17:49.573 --> 17:50.054
Right.

17:51.516 --> 17:53.780
I was only in B-47s at McDill.

17:53.980 --> 17:54.281
I see.

17:54.301 --> 17:56.524
And when I left there, I went to B-52s.

18:00.284 --> 18:02.266
That's going back.

18:02.286 --> 18:03.768
That's pretty much right after you enlisted.

18:03.788 --> 18:06.592
That's when I went into basic training, I think.

18:07.493 --> 18:13.921
I'll tell you what, if Norman Rockwell could paint a picture of a young farm boy going into the service, he would paint that picture right there.

18:14.101 --> 18:21.370
That looks like a farm kid from Snook being put in the uniform and ready to go.

18:21.390 --> 18:22.791
Probably didn't know what was ahead of you.

18:23.132 --> 18:27.557
Now we fast forward a few years to 1967.

18:28.330 --> 18:31.354
Do you remember where this picture was taken and what your position was there?

18:34.219 --> 18:37.243
I was probably... Where were you in November of 67?

18:37.283 --> 18:42.230
67 I was at Griffiths Air Force Base in Rome, New York.

18:42.430 --> 18:51.203
And I flew on a combat crew up until a few years, four months before I retired.

18:51.784 --> 18:52.465
But I was...

18:53.002 --> 18:57.089
Up in Griffish, I was put in the standardization section.

18:58.772 --> 19:01.557
We gave checks to all the rest of the crews.

19:01.578 --> 19:10.133
And then when I went to Seymour, I was the head of the standardization division at Seymour Johnson.

19:10.619 --> 19:14.965
But I still flew on the crew and pulled alert like all the other crew members.

19:14.985 --> 19:16.947
We just had a little more extra work to do.

19:17.288 --> 19:18.309
Right.

19:18.389 --> 19:24.217
You came home in December of 1945, which was your 22nd birthday is when you came home from the war.

19:24.237 --> 19:30.926
1951, you found yourself in college at the University of Houston, and you got called up again.

19:30.946 --> 19:31.106
Right.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.069
Talk about that and sort of what it led to.

19:34.731 --> 19:39.057
Well, I got called on February of 1951,

19:39.357 --> 19:41.261
And I thought I was going to go to Korea.

19:42.022 --> 19:46.832
But instead, I went to Lackland Air Force Base.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.155
And they gave us a bunch of tests.

19:48.175 --> 19:52.664
And they had a quota for a radar maintenance officer school.

19:53.165 --> 19:57.855
And I guess because I was trying to major in math in University of Houston.

19:58.173 --> 20:05.663
and you need math for electronics, they sent me on that quota to Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi.

20:06.544 --> 20:08.887
For 10 months, I studied electronics.

20:09.368 --> 20:13.894
And from there, I went to Otis, to AC&W Squadron.

20:14.655 --> 20:15.877
That's in Cape Cod, right?

20:16.057 --> 20:16.658
Cape Cod.

20:16.678 --> 20:17.739
And you met Barbara there.

20:17.779 --> 20:18.961
That's where I met Barbara.

20:18.981 --> 20:21.284
And we got married up there.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.528
And had one boy born in Butters Bay, Massachusetts.

20:26.791 --> 20:27.252
Right.

20:27.451 --> 20:55.315
after this ACNW squadron was a National Guard call-up outfit and they deactivated them so they sent me to one of the big radar sets at Brunswick Naval Air Station which is up Brunswick, Maine and I was up there only a few months when they decided I ought to go overseas to Tripoli, Libya and

20:56.746 --> 21:00.171
Barbara was seven months pregnant with the second child.

21:00.832 --> 21:05.599
And so the idea was I was going to go over there and she was going to come later.

21:05.619 --> 21:08.403
Well, I got over there and they said, no housing.

21:08.423 --> 21:10.927
You have to live on the economy over there.

21:10.947 --> 21:12.850
And I didn't think she'd like to do that.

21:12.930 --> 21:16.155
So they said, you can go out to this remote site.

21:16.557 --> 21:18.179
and the year tour or so.

21:18.279 --> 21:19.100
For a one year tour?

21:19.200 --> 21:19.901
One year tour.

21:20.161 --> 21:21.062
So you opted for that?

21:21.082 --> 21:25.247
So I opted for that out in the desert at an early warning radar site.

21:25.328 --> 21:26.869
Sounds like that was a very lonely job.

21:27.610 --> 21:31.375
Yeah, we only had one guy that went nuts.

21:31.395 --> 21:31.495
Yeah.

21:31.515 --> 21:32.236
But anyhow.

21:34.078 --> 21:34.579
What did you do?

21:34.599 --> 21:39.304
I know you tracked flights coming out of Egypt and other areas in Europe, is that right?

21:39.424 --> 21:44.050
It was an early warning radar site which boldly tracks airplanes

21:44.637 --> 21:46.119
before they get to Wheelus.

21:46.139 --> 21:50.644
That's about 200 miles, 250 miles east of Wheelus.

21:50.664 --> 21:54.488
And we had a big radar site.

21:54.548 --> 21:55.970
We had our own power unit.

21:55.990 --> 21:58.132
We had just like a little base.

22:00.155 --> 22:02.738
I was out there and I had about seven additional duties.

22:04.820 --> 22:10.206
I ended up being that detachment commander

22:10.743 --> 22:12.606
before I left out there in one year.

22:12.626 --> 22:17.052
You said your second son was born and he was a year old before you got to see him, right?

22:17.152 --> 22:17.933
Yeah, that's right.

22:18.534 --> 22:23.361
I came back, that's when they decided I was going to be an aircraft commander in the B-47.

22:24.422 --> 22:29.109
Like you said, my second son was a year old when I saw him.

22:29.770 --> 22:30.070
Right.

22:30.791 --> 22:33.375
The difference between the C-47 and the B-47.

22:34.199 --> 22:40.045
Well, the cruising speed of a C-47 was about the landing speed of a B-47.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.668
Things happen a lot faster.

22:43.869 --> 22:47.953
Yeah, 450 knots on a B-47.

22:48.513 --> 22:49.114
Right.

22:49.134 --> 22:52.998
You said that one of the hardest things you ever had to do was the refueling process.

22:53.378 --> 22:53.959
Right.

22:53.979 --> 22:55.600
And keep that thing steady.

22:55.640 --> 23:00.705
Talk about what was involved with that in-air refueling process.

23:01.286 --> 23:03.548
Well, probably harder for

23:04.405 --> 23:12.057
Somebody like me, we'd never flown a lot of formation or anything, and we got within a half a mile of another airplane, and we thought we were as close.

23:12.758 --> 23:20.870
And then when you had to go right up underneath that thing, it's a ticklish situation, very much.

23:23.054 --> 23:25.818
Like I say, I've never concentrated on anything so hard.

23:25.838 --> 23:30.345
And most people I know of were wringing wet sweat when they got through.

23:30.680 --> 23:36.287
Especially refueling the B-47 on an old KC-97 that couldn't go but 200 knots.

23:36.307 --> 23:39.852
And we were about to stall out back there behind them.

23:39.872 --> 23:43.837
And of course it was a blessing when we finally got some KC-97s.

23:43.857 --> 23:50.346
And of course we were fueled down to 15,000 feet in the KC-97 where all the weather was usually up to.

23:50.366 --> 23:52.348
And you're going through clouds.

23:52.368 --> 23:55.152
It's the toughest thing I ever tried to do in my life.

23:55.553 --> 24:00.398
You were on duty during the Cuban crisis, during the Cold War and during the Cuban crisis.

24:00.418 --> 24:03.242
You were at MacDill during the Cuban crisis, is that right?

24:03.262 --> 24:03.382
Right.

24:03.402 --> 24:11.111
But the night that President Kennedy made the speech, the nose-to-nose speech to Khrushchev, where were you that night?

24:11.631 --> 24:15.716
I was on a C-97 going to Hunter.

24:16.116 --> 24:20.982
They had moved the whole wing out of MacDill in about two days up to Savannah.

24:21.102 --> 24:21.342
Right.

24:21.592 --> 24:25.997
And the fighters and reconnaissance airplanes took over McDill.

24:26.537 --> 24:30.481
And I was on that airplane when I heard him making a speech.

24:31.322 --> 24:37.128
Of course, we had known what was going on, I guess, and not many people did.

24:37.569 --> 24:38.670
Exactly, exactly.

24:39.091 --> 24:42.394
And it could have led to a lot more, obviously.

24:42.774 --> 24:47.059
And when the Cuban crisis was over,

24:47.528 --> 24:49.512
I got orders to go to B22.

24:50.033 --> 24:50.574
Right, right.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.420
This is an item that was given to you.

24:54.943 --> 24:58.851
I don't know how close we can get on that.

24:58.871 --> 25:00.334
We'll go right there.

25:00.976 --> 25:04.002
This is, I guess, a jewelry box, is that right?

25:04.353 --> 25:05.394
I don't know what it is.

25:05.514 --> 25:10.179
It's a cigarette box, cigar box, a jewelry box, or whatever.

25:10.359 --> 25:10.799
There we go.

25:11.400 --> 25:21.450
And it was given to you, I'll read the inscription on the back, presented by General Kim Sung-yong, Chief of Staff of the Republic of Korea Air Force.

25:23.332 --> 25:24.894
1969, about.

25:26.135 --> 25:30.259
And I think...

25:31.943 --> 25:33.992
They wanted to fly on a beauty too, I guess.

25:34.254 --> 25:38.433
There were three of them, him and two other generals with him.

25:38.553 --> 25:40.502
And they were

25:40.853 --> 25:43.397
I said most excited about air refueling.

25:43.557 --> 25:44.258
I bet.

25:44.278 --> 25:44.499
Yeah.

25:44.719 --> 25:46.301
So, and he got a box out of the deal.

25:46.341 --> 25:46.602
Yeah.

25:46.822 --> 25:47.804
That's great.

25:47.824 --> 25:52.531
He gave everybody on the crew a little gift, and they were not all the same.

25:52.631 --> 25:53.132
That's right.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.894
I know that that's quite a keepsake.

25:55.195 --> 25:59.962
You retired in July of 1970, and you worked 13 years at Twin City Mission.

25:59.982 --> 26:04.289
And I'd like to talk more about that, but we're just about out of time.

26:04.489 --> 26:07.654
But thank you very much for your service, and thank you for being here today.

26:07.904 --> 26:08.625
Thank you.

26:08.805 --> 26:10.006
Thank you.

26:10.026 --> 26:16.154
LeRoy Schoenemann is one of the many who sacrificed his most vital years to serve in World War II.

26:16.814 --> 26:23.743
In retirement in Bryan, he can be found tending to his land near Schnuck or enjoying his and Barbara's seven grandchildren.

26:23.763 --> 26:26.426
It's a retirement that is certainly well-earned.

26:26.446 --> 26:27.387
I'm Tom Turbiville.

26:27.407 --> 26:30.030
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
