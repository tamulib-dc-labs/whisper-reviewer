Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:29.579 --> 00:44.155
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.216
I'm Tom Turberville.

00:46.318 --> 00:55.688
Last week we introduced you to College Station's Colonel Ken Lovelace, a helicopter pilot with two tours of Vietnam following a tour of Korea and then later overseas again.

00:56.073 --> 01:01.463
Like the cat with nine lives, Ken Loveless turned back death time and time again during his service.

01:01.944 --> 01:05.310
And we are very glad he is still here to tell us his story.

01:05.330 --> 01:08.296
Welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, Ken Loveless.

01:09.117 --> 01:12.163
At least nine times that you've survived crashes.

01:12.984 --> 01:14.187
Not all crashes.

01:14.207 --> 01:14.808
Not all crashes.

01:14.828 --> 01:17.052
Nine times having to leave the

01:17.504 --> 01:19.086
the sky against my will.

01:19.266 --> 01:19.527
Right.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.830
Not your normal landing.

01:22.091 --> 01:24.093
Normally you were able to make it.

01:24.434 --> 01:25.876
I think five of those in choppers.

01:27.318 --> 01:29.581
Your flying career almost never got started.

01:29.601 --> 01:34.909
I want you to talk about what happened in 1961 at Fort Walters in Mineral Wells.

01:34.929 --> 01:38.273
We have some pictures of it later, but you describe what happened that day.

01:38.494 --> 01:44.322
Well, as a student at Fort Walters, Texas, we would

01:44.875 --> 01:51.605
in the mornings or afternoon, depending if you were flying in the morning or you had two flying periods each day.

01:52.706 --> 02:02.120
They would put a tail number on the chalkboard next to your name, and that's the aircraft that you would go out and find, and that's the one you would fly that day.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.523
I had already soloed.

02:05.365 --> 02:12.655
So that particular morning was a cold, cold morning, clear blue sky, and...

02:13.310 --> 02:20.341
I finally got a tail number by my name, behind my name, and off to the flight line I went.

02:20.361 --> 02:23.045
I found the aircraft, and it was a beautiful thing.

02:23.105 --> 02:26.029
It was the cleanest one I guess I'd ever seen.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.493
In fact, I was amazed at how nice it was.

02:29.375 --> 02:41.393
And I pre-flighted, got in, cranked it up, hovered out to the takeoff pad, requested takeoff, and took off.

02:41.930 --> 02:47.017
We have something in the helicopter business called the dead man's curve.

02:47.918 --> 02:55.027
If you're over 15 feet and up to about 200 feet and your engine quits, you normally don't survive.

02:55.068 --> 02:56.710
The airplane is going to crash.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.254
Now, what happens to you, of course, is another story.

03:01.456 --> 03:02.918
But that's exactly what happened.

03:02.938 --> 03:03.999
I was climbing out.

03:04.019 --> 03:10.468
I had maximum takeoff manifold, the power, and I had the nose

03:10.837 --> 03:16.363
tipped over just forward a bit to get a good gradual climb.

03:17.625 --> 03:22.030
And the engine blew up, two rod-in bearings.

03:22.891 --> 03:34.544
And the two pistons sounded like a bomb to me, but I only had a few seconds to get to the ground, you know, before I was to the ground.

03:34.684 --> 03:37.047
I had time to get out a couple of maydays.

03:37.870 --> 03:41.977
I don't know why I did that, but it came to me.

03:41.997 --> 03:58.326
And I leveled the aircraft for landing and was just starting to pull the nose up into a flare so I could cushion the aircraft on the ground, pulling some pitch to the blades.

03:58.795 --> 04:04.642
And all of a sudden, my beautiful picture turned into solid brown.

04:05.864 --> 04:06.845
It was dirt.

04:07.686 --> 04:13.333
So it went from half ground in sky to nothing but brown.

04:14.094 --> 04:18.459
And, of course, I went into the ground nose first.

04:21.924 --> 04:25.448
I released myself.

04:25.949 --> 04:28.532
The aircraft ended up on the right side.

04:29.069 --> 04:33.034
And it had beat itself to death on the ground.

04:33.695 --> 04:40.625
But I was laying on the right door, looking up through the left door, the beautiful clear blue sky.

04:41.766 --> 04:46.853
And trying to get my bearings, I saw my wallet that had come out of my flight suit.

04:46.933 --> 04:48.255
I got my wallet.

04:48.275 --> 04:49.436
I got a seat cushion.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.362
And I was in my helmet.

04:53.382 --> 04:58.148
And I was going to crawl out the front of what was left of the bubble, which was a

04:58.499 --> 05:04.946
plexiglass-type bubble, and there was a hole in it.

05:04.966 --> 05:26.430
But when I tried to get out, I was paralyzed, and I couldn't, I could move my arms and hands, but I couldn't move my trunk or my legs, and so I'm still laying up with my legs up above me, and I heard a crackling.

05:27.473 --> 05:30.017
And then smoke started coming in.

05:30.037 --> 05:31.338
So I knew it was on fire.

05:31.378 --> 05:34.963
Of course, I had a full load of fuel when I took off.

05:34.983 --> 05:40.431
So on impact, the fuel cell ruptured.

05:41.292 --> 05:46.039
And it was just a matter of seconds before it started burning.

05:46.059 --> 05:49.304
And I could not get out.

05:49.324 --> 05:52.368
I tried several times to get out, and I couldn't.

05:53.369 --> 05:56.113
I laid back on my back, and

05:56.363 --> 06:00.486
I said, well, I guess this is it.

06:00.506 --> 06:01.948
It's all over.

06:01.968 --> 06:07.532
And I was just looking at the sky and the smoke coming into the cockpit area.

06:08.994 --> 06:14.818
And I heard a voice say, we've got to get out of here.

06:14.919 --> 06:16.080
It's going to explode.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.123
And I turned around and there was a man coming in the front.

06:20.163 --> 06:26.168
He grabbed me and pulled me out through the hole in the plexiglass.

06:26.823 --> 06:33.469
pulled me out, drugged me out about 10 yards or so.

06:33.749 --> 06:38.033
He actually stuck his head under my arm, and I was dead weight.

06:38.654 --> 06:43.238
So he was carrying all of my weight.

06:43.258 --> 06:44.900
And we both fell down.

06:45.440 --> 06:45.981
He fell.

06:46.501 --> 06:47.482
We both went down.

06:48.243 --> 06:55.750
And we were on the ground when the helicopter did explode and burned up.

06:56.455 --> 06:59.019
And I guess we'll see a picture of that one.

06:59.039 --> 07:12.321
But anyway, I was obviously happy to get away, but another helicopter came in, a medical evac helicopter.

07:13.003 --> 07:21.096
In fact, it was the same type of helicopter I was flying, except they had a little pod, a little pod on each side.

07:21.785 --> 07:26.879
From cross tube landing gear, cross tube, front cross tube, back tube.

07:27.621 --> 07:33.456
And they put me on that thing, looking straight up into the rotor system.

07:33.476 --> 07:35.462
And that's how they flew me to the hospital.

07:36.344 --> 07:37.768
That was more frightening.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.389
The only one I had been through.

07:41.011 --> 07:41.732
It was a crash.

07:42.432 --> 07:43.574
I guess not.

07:43.594 --> 07:48.159
And of all the times that you had these emergencies, that's really the only one that you didn't walk away from.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.902
You were laid up for about six weeks with a broken back.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.225
Yeah, broken back, leg, and teeth.

07:53.766 --> 07:54.847
Yeah.

07:55.688 --> 07:57.390
Okay, I want to talk about another one.

07:58.371 --> 08:00.473
You were one of about nine in a Huey.

08:00.493 --> 08:03.537
You weren't the pilot that the pilot had flown into a thunderstorm.

08:04.597 --> 08:10.444
Talk about that and what happened to the pilot and what you did to manage that situation.

08:10.744 --> 08:32.410
In Vietnam, when a person wanted to go someplace or go to another area of Vietnam, you could drop into any Army helicourt or an Air Force base and get your name on a list and they would, first time something was going in that direction, you would go out and get on the aircraft and that was your means of transportation.

08:32.430 --> 08:33.591
This particular area,

08:33.638 --> 08:54.053
afternoon, I was waiting to catch a ride down to a place called Sok Trang, which was, again, down in the lower part of Vietnam in the Mekong Delta area, which was going to be my parent headquarters when I took command of the assault helicopter company.

08:54.514 --> 08:58.060
So that would be where my boss was actually at his office.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.870
And I caught a ride with some guys.

09:02.030 --> 09:06.876
There were about nine of us that caught rides that day that were in the helicopter.

09:08.098 --> 09:15.588
It had a crew of four, pilot, co-pilot, or aircraft commander, pilot, door gunners, two on each side.

09:16.449 --> 09:18.131
And we took off late in the evening.

09:18.452 --> 09:22.096
It was dark and headed south.

09:22.116 --> 09:24.840
And I got to talking to the guy next to me.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.023
And in a helicopter, you don't talk normally.

09:27.043 --> 09:27.844
You just holler it.

09:28.364 --> 09:30.526
in order to be heard.

09:30.546 --> 09:36.774
And he had been an aviator at one time because I was asking what unit he was assigned to.

09:36.834 --> 09:37.775
I saw his wings.

09:38.776 --> 09:44.362
And he said, no, he was grounded, medically grounded, which means he can't fly anymore.

09:45.203 --> 09:47.966
And he was a fixed-wing pilot, not a helicopter pilot.

09:47.986 --> 09:58.118
But we were passing comments back and forth when the pilot flew into a squall line.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.374
That's a rolling type of a frontal system.

10:03.516 --> 10:13.449
And this, at night, was laced with lightning and heavy, heavy rain.

10:13.469 --> 10:20.179
When it rains in Vietnam, you can't believe how heavy it rains.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.240
You think it rains here.

10:21.300 --> 10:27.329
It does rain here compared to Vietnam, especially during the monsoon season.

10:28.110 --> 10:29.151
Well, he flew in.

10:30.278 --> 10:44.272
In the corrective action for a pilot, when you enter a squall line or any thunderstorm, you do a 180 degree turn and fly back out and go somewhere else.

10:45.854 --> 10:50.419
He did what he was supposed to do, and I was very proud of him.

10:50.439 --> 10:57.366
I didn't know his name or who he was assigned to, but man's been taught to do the right thing.

10:57.953 --> 11:05.480
But he turned around again and went and tried to penetrate the squall line.

11:05.500 --> 11:13.428
And now you're on the IFR instrument flying on the instruments, on the gauges.

11:14.529 --> 11:25.159
And you can't see, and you've got heavy rain, strong winds, and lightning.

11:26.692 --> 11:28.634
I was watching the co-pilots.

11:29.135 --> 11:30.777
I could see from where I was sitting.

11:30.857 --> 11:36.844
I could see his artificial horizon, his turning bank, his altitude indicator.

11:38.106 --> 11:42.871
And the aircraft was getting slow.

11:42.891 --> 11:45.034
It was going too slow.

11:45.054 --> 11:47.056
And I hollered to the fellow next to me.

11:47.397 --> 11:51.241
He said, Ken, are you an instrument pilot?

11:51.261 --> 11:52.022
And I said, yeah.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.505
And if I ever see that

11:55.480 --> 12:00.585
airspeed indicator go to zero, I'm going to take over this thing.

12:01.566 --> 12:02.207
Well, it did.

12:03.428 --> 12:17.222
And we were, from what I could tell when I got up there, we were going backwards, zero airspeed backwards, and on the right side, like this, just falling out of the sky.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.826
And the aircraft was doing all kinds of gyrations.

12:21.246 --> 12:24.930
And I really thought we'd probably break apart in the air.

12:25.585 --> 12:39.428
So I grabbed the helmet from the crew chief, who was right behind me, and I got up to between the pilot and the co-pilot.

12:40.770 --> 12:41.852
We have a console.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.977
On the console are radios.

12:44.997 --> 12:47.762
There's a map case back in the back.

12:48.130 --> 12:55.140
And different control buttons and whatever.

12:55.160 --> 12:59.726
And I threw myself across on top of that console.

13:00.427 --> 13:05.133
And I ripped my leg and my pants in the process.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.798
And I was trying to talk to the guy.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.363
I plugged into the co-pilots.

13:12.924 --> 13:13.705
He was frozen.

13:13.825 --> 13:15.027
He was just sitting like this.

13:15.087 --> 13:15.808
He wouldn't move.

13:16.227 --> 13:21.616
Later on, he'd only been in country for two weeks, so he didn't know what he should do or not do.

13:22.136 --> 13:30.329
But the pilot was what we call a washing-out cockpit.

13:31.351 --> 13:32.793
He was moving the collective.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.038
That's what makes you go forward, back, side, and do all your turns.

13:36.379 --> 13:37.581
He was just doing like that.

13:37.621 --> 13:43.450
Well, when you do that, the rotor system is here, and you're just...

13:44.105 --> 13:48.109
You're just washing through what you're supposed to be, you know, air.

13:48.770 --> 13:50.412
You're not making any forward speed.

13:50.632 --> 13:52.695
So we're just falling through the sky.

13:53.596 --> 14:00.083
And I tried to get him using methods of construction.

14:00.123 --> 14:03.026
Talked to him real calm.

14:05.229 --> 14:07.451
Pull in climb, take off power.

14:08.032 --> 14:11.416
This was a turbine type helicopter.

14:11.816 --> 14:12.677
Take off power.

14:13.045 --> 14:23.881
pull in, trick manifold pressure, I mean torque power, and push the cyclic stick over to get airspeed.

14:24.622 --> 14:25.303
But he wouldn't do it.

14:25.343 --> 14:26.424
He just kept laughing out.

14:28.307 --> 14:30.510
So I hit him in the face as hard as I could hit him.

14:32.894 --> 14:35.197
And he turned loose in the controls.

14:36.559 --> 14:42.107
And I was able just to lay on my stomach, but I could reach the cyclic.

14:42.526 --> 14:43.948
And the collective was here.

14:45.090 --> 14:50.998
And so I rolled on cruise power, takeoff power.

14:51.258 --> 14:56.446
I pulled a maximum power torque and pushed the sidekick over.

14:57.307 --> 15:03.816
And finally, it leveled off and started to move.

15:03.977 --> 15:06.340
And we got airspeed, and we started climbing.

15:07.518 --> 15:13.326
We fell from better than 2,000 feet down to 200 feet because the altimeter was on 200.

15:13.666 --> 15:14.687
You couldn't see outside.

15:14.707 --> 15:17.151
It was pitch black and in the rain.

15:17.731 --> 15:21.797
But the altimeter was the only thing that told me how close we were to the ground.

15:22.197 --> 15:23.559
We were about 200 feet.

15:23.979 --> 15:33.572
And that is 200 feet if the pilot had properly entered the right altitude when he left at takeoff point.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.816
So that was...

15:37.758 --> 15:38.499
Not any fun.

15:38.859 --> 15:45.426
No, but you landed it laying across the control panels after you had stunned the pilot.

15:45.486 --> 15:54.656
I got it flying, and when we broke out of the storm, we crossed the river, and I knew what river it was.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.338
It was moonlit back there.

15:56.378 --> 16:02.464
I asked him if he felt he could fly, and he said, yeah.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.267
So I gave it to him, and he flew it on to us.

16:05.467 --> 16:06.589
Not to stop train.

16:06.629 --> 16:09.935
We went to an alternate place to land.

16:09.995 --> 16:10.415
Exactly.

16:10.856 --> 16:17.988
I want to go to some pictures now that Colonel Loveless has loaned to us to show right now.

16:18.048 --> 16:19.431
So let's go to some pictures.

16:19.511 --> 16:26.463
This is your crew, and I guess you're down, crouched down in the middle, right?

16:26.663 --> 16:27.785
Kneeling in the center, yeah.

16:28.967 --> 16:30.850
And this is your Vietnam crew, is that right?

16:31.049 --> 16:37.619
This was the gun outfit, the Razorbacks, that I was in on my first tour to Vietnam.

16:37.639 --> 16:38.780
I was a captain then.

16:39.121 --> 16:40.282
I see.

16:40.362 --> 16:42.786
Fine-looking soldiers there.

16:42.806 --> 16:43.807
Good folk.

16:44.649 --> 16:47.793
We showed a print similar to this on our last show.

16:47.813 --> 16:50.958
This is another one that hangs in your home.

16:52.841 --> 16:53.722
Just sort of a depiction.

16:53.742 --> 16:55.825
The model gunship, Razorbacks.

16:55.965 --> 16:57.948
See the red pig painted on the door.

16:58.228 --> 16:58.709
Exactly.

16:59.030 --> 17:00.752
And that's what it looked like at night.

17:02.048 --> 17:02.369
Wow.

17:02.891 --> 17:03.172
Okay.

17:04.415 --> 17:05.218
We'll move on.

17:05.238 --> 17:13.524
Now, you told the story about this is what your chopper looked like after the crash in mineral wells at Fort Walters.

17:13.544 --> 17:15.771
This is what you were pulled out of.

17:16.173 --> 17:16.894
That's right.

17:17.134 --> 17:24.960
And I don't know if you can see it, but there is a wire system running, a high-tension wire running across.

17:25.081 --> 17:32.647
And they say that's what my tail, my pogo stick on the back of the H-23 struck.

17:32.787 --> 17:40.954
And that's what tipped my nose over, made me go into the ground nose first rather than on a level.

17:41.915 --> 17:45.538
Well, you look at that, and you're just amazed at how you were able to survive that.

17:46.379 --> 17:53.655
Very fortunate that the flight instructor came in and got you, and I think we've got a picture of him coming up.

17:53.776 --> 17:54.678
That's him right now.

17:54.718 --> 17:56.121
This was in a magazine article.

17:56.983 --> 18:03.257
Edward Blondell is his name, and this is the soldier that saved your life.

18:03.507 --> 18:07.451
Yeah, he was actually a Southern Airways pilot.

18:08.232 --> 18:11.996
They were on contract to provide instructor pilots for the Army.

18:12.016 --> 18:14.178
So he used to be an Air Force guy.

18:14.398 --> 18:14.759
I see.

18:14.779 --> 18:22.827
He was in Air Force, and he got out and went to work with Southern Airways as a flight instructor.

18:22.847 --> 18:24.929
Here's you, and talk about this picture.

18:25.670 --> 18:29.734
This was when I was in...

18:30.018 --> 18:37.510
primary helicopter training at Monroe Wells, and I was a second lieutenant, what was called Butter Bars then.

18:37.710 --> 18:37.991
Right.

18:38.431 --> 18:50.070
Second lieutenant, and that's my oldest son, dressed up and fixed up in fatigues and combat boots, just like I wore.

18:50.250 --> 18:50.991
Proud of his dad.

18:52.133 --> 18:52.313
Yeah.

18:53.474 --> 18:57.241
And this has nothing to do with your military career, but this is one of your hobbies.

18:57.301 --> 19:01.969
And I just wanted to put a picture of your Corvette in your garage.

19:02.049 --> 19:04.374
And you're proud of these wheels, aren't you?

19:04.975 --> 19:12.228
Yeah, I've got almost, it's a 1978 Indy pace car, Indianapolis pace car.

19:12.849 --> 19:17.457
And I've got about almost 9,000 actual miles on it now.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.287
It's not driving very hard.

19:20.890 --> 19:22.752
No, I'll bet.

19:23.534 --> 19:26.278
There's a lot of other incidents that we could talk to you about.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.202
I want you to describe one more.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.649
This was in Vietnam, a landing zone that you thought was cold.

19:33.689 --> 19:35.952
It turned out to be hot.

19:36.556 --> 19:39.799
and you actually had to fly out with zero oil pressure.

19:39.839 --> 19:40.620
Talk about that.

19:41.521 --> 20:06.023
Well, what happened there, I had a light fire team out, and we were in what, in Vietnam, we called them the pineapple fields, and we were hitting targets of opportunity with rockets, and an Air Force forward air controller saw us working in that area and called us and asked us if we would come over to where another unit

20:06.560 --> 20:13.067
And some American soldiers were in a combat assault.

20:13.087 --> 20:16.751
And it had gone wrong.

20:16.771 --> 20:21.916
Evidently, the enemy was well entrenched, waiting for them when they got there.

20:22.777 --> 20:26.762
And he called me and asked me if I could come over and need some help.

20:27.562 --> 20:29.625
So I said, sure, we'll be right there.

20:29.665 --> 20:30.365
And so we flew.

20:30.526 --> 20:31.106
We could see.

20:31.386 --> 20:34.710
I could see the black smoke and five.

20:35.095 --> 20:36.997
Aircraft were burning, actually.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.461
Five helicopters, our helicopter.

20:40.481 --> 20:51.372
And there was another helicopter that had been called in to resupply the troops that were pinned down in this landing zone.

20:52.473 --> 21:00.021
It wasn't one of my helicopters or from the outfit we were in or never heard of before, but I kept trying to tell him to wait.

21:00.242 --> 21:03.465
If you would wait, what we normally do is we do.

21:03.665 --> 21:07.210
or supply or go into an LZ that's hot.

21:08.812 --> 21:18.926
We put a gunship on each side and start laying down rockets so the enemy will stay down in the aircraft and get on or off.

21:19.006 --> 21:22.932
Well, in this particular case, he didn't stop.

21:23.192 --> 21:26.217
I mean, he didn't wait for us to accompany him in.

21:27.619 --> 21:32.946
And he flew on in and got right to the ground in the aircraft

21:33.719 --> 21:38.144
Just an explosion just went up, upside down.

21:38.164 --> 21:44.251
And I was hollering at him the whole time not to go in there, but he did anyway.

21:44.972 --> 21:49.176
And I didn't see anybody come out of the aircraft.

21:49.196 --> 21:50.898
Well, I knew the aircraft was going to burn.

21:51.138 --> 21:52.680
I mean, there's five already burning.

21:53.341 --> 21:56.604
And if he's sitting there and they hit the fuel, I mean, it's going to burn.

21:57.626 --> 21:59.888
But I didn't see any of the four guys get out.

21:59.928 --> 22:03.372
There should have been a pilot, co-pilot, crew chief, and a door gun.

22:03.875 --> 22:07.340
And so I went in to try to find out where they were.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.121
Were they dead?

22:08.882 --> 22:11.606
Or were they, could they get out?

22:12.147 --> 22:13.208
Or what the problem was?

22:13.869 --> 22:17.394
Got right down and started looking into the wreckage.

22:17.414 --> 22:19.337
And about that time I looked out my door.

22:19.357 --> 22:21.580
Now, we had 48 rockets on board.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.643
We had 24 pods on each side.

22:25.185 --> 22:30.232
And I saw this American soldier laying on his stomach, pointing like that.

22:30.653 --> 22:30.793
Mm-hmm.

22:31.094 --> 22:45.690
So as I turned around and looked, the whole rice paddy dyke, we call them, nothing but black pajamas and straw hats.

22:46.551 --> 22:47.673
And they were shooting at me.

22:48.514 --> 22:49.955
I mean, I'm looking.

22:50.155 --> 22:56.142
I can see the whites of their eyes and watch the blast from their rifles and guns.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.705
And it sounded.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.472
just like we were in a popcorn popper.

23:02.313 --> 23:10.142
The rounds were hitting the aircraft, just pow, pow, pow, just like when you're cooking popcorn and it starts to pop.

23:10.262 --> 23:11.203
That's what it sounded like.

23:12.364 --> 23:15.588
And my side caught fire.

23:15.648 --> 23:19.713
The rocket pod was on fire.

23:21.415 --> 23:24.979
And I had a man seriously shot.

23:26.191 --> 23:31.599
And then they had also ruptured my oil reservoir, which is under pressure.

23:32.560 --> 23:40.110
And the oil mixed with the blood was coating all of us in there.

23:40.190 --> 23:42.394
I mean, the other three of us.

23:42.414 --> 23:49.784
One guy, the one right behind me got hit pretty hard.

23:50.004 --> 23:50.905
Right.

23:50.925 --> 23:51.366
Real hard.

23:52.448 --> 23:55.692
So we blew our pods.

23:56.566 --> 24:07.138
to get the weight off and had no alternative but to try to fly right over the guys that were shooting at us.

24:08.199 --> 24:12.925
And we made it out, but we had zero oil pressure.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.988
That's a turbine engine.

24:16.008 --> 24:22.776
I don't know how long a turbine will run without oil, but we were going to find out because that was not the place to sit down and look.

24:23.448 --> 24:28.915
So we got several rice paddies over before we went in.

24:28.935 --> 24:35.904
And we were able to get another ship to come in and pick my crew up and take them to the hospital.

24:36.144 --> 24:36.905
But I was lucky.

24:37.786 --> 24:39.148
Didn't get a scratch.

24:39.268 --> 24:39.829
Lucky again.

24:40.409 --> 24:42.792
We've only got about two and a half minutes left.

24:42.812 --> 24:48.139
There's so much more to tell after your final tour of Vietnam, a transfer to Germany that you had asked for.

24:48.507 --> 24:49.548
And I know you liked that.

24:49.568 --> 24:53.312
I figured the only way I could keep from going back to Vietnam was to go to Germany.

24:53.533 --> 24:53.733
Right.

24:53.953 --> 24:56.936
I could enter here to transfer to Germany.

24:56.956 --> 25:03.624
So I went over and took command of the C-854 outfit, flying cranes.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.348
The crane will actually lift 10 tons.

25:07.368 --> 25:17.940
We can carry trucks, 114 armored personnel carriers, do some half trucks, anything that weigh over 10 tons.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.485
we could pick up and fly with.

25:20.505 --> 25:26.293
We had a people pod on that airplane that would carry 45 people.

25:26.313 --> 25:28.136
So we could hard point that under it.

25:28.817 --> 25:35.005
And of course, the engines, you had two Pratt & Whitney engines, each one 4,500.

25:35.706 --> 25:41.454
So you're throwing about 9,000 horsepower to the rotor head itself.

25:41.474 --> 25:47.843
And it was a fantastic helicopter made by Sikorsky, a CH-54 flying crane.

25:48.262 --> 25:52.028
So I commanded that unit until I left Germany.

25:52.268 --> 25:54.111
Right.

25:54.732 --> 25:57.255
Your resume is so amazing, and we are running out of time.

25:57.275 --> 26:04.606
But just briefly, April of 70 to Norfolk, Virginia, the Armed Forces Staff College.

26:04.987 --> 26:10.255
Back to Germany as an Inspector General of the 1st Armored Division in southern Germany.

26:10.635 --> 26:15.383
To Fort Rucker, to Indiana as a professor of military science.

26:15.583 --> 26:15.703
Yeah.

26:16.274 --> 26:24.227
the Army Rep to the Royal College of Defense Studies in London for a year in 1984, where you were expected to speak for the president.

26:24.247 --> 26:32.340
Yeah, they would ask me questions, and I knew I shouldn't be answering them.

26:33.041 --> 26:42.416
Also, a battle staff commander at Silk Purse in England in the European Airborne Command Post, where you were carrying the football in case of attack.

26:43.177 --> 26:43.277
Yeah.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.370
Just a wonderful resume, and thank you very much for your service, but we're out of time.

26:47.530 --> 26:50.294
But thank you for your service, and we're very glad you're here.

26:50.554 --> 26:51.516
Thank you for having me.

26:51.536 --> 26:52.417
Thank you, Colonel Lovelace.

26:52.838 --> 27:00.850
Ken Lovelace packed a lot in the 34 years of service, and today he and his wife, Sandy, live in retirement in College Station, where they stay very active.

27:01.290 --> 27:04.175
We salute Colonel Ken Lovelace for his service.

27:04.195 --> 27:05.136
I'm Tom Turboville.

27:05.176 --> 27:07.780
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
