00:03.254 --> 00:31.901
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.921 --> 00:33.042
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:33.815 --> 00:44.500
The 28th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, the 28th Seabees, that is, can trace its roots to before World War II, where after D-Day it helped close up and secure Omaha Beach.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.606
Mike Guidry is rightfully proud of the history of the 28th, as he was part of it and still is today.

00:51.087 --> 01:07.385
Mike Guidry spent six months in Iraq at Camp Fallujah and Al-Assad, attached to the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, working together to ensure what is believed to be a successful surge that has decreased significantly the casualties in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

01:07.405 --> 01:11.990
He anticipates redeployment in 2010, with Afghanistan his next orders.

01:12.431 --> 01:14.233
Please welcome EO2 Mike Guidry.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.548
to Veterans of the Valley.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.970
Mike, it's great to have you.

01:16.990 --> 01:20.815
Thank you again for your service and a really fascinating story about the Seabees.

01:20.855 --> 01:30.448
When I think about Seabees, I always think back to World War II and you think about them in the Pacific and building runways and building shacks and Guadalcanal and all that.

01:30.468 --> 01:35.455
But when you think of the Seabees in the Iraqi war, that's sort of a new concept to a lot of people.

01:35.475 --> 01:39.360
Talk a little bit about where you were, where you went,

01:39.813 --> 01:42.338
and what you did as a member of the 28th.

01:42.398 --> 01:43.981
So sort of an overview of what y'all did.

01:44.402 --> 01:44.823
Absolutely.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.266
There's about 500 of us total.

01:46.687 --> 01:47.989
And thank you.

01:48.030 --> 01:52.098
It is an honor to be on the show and appreciate everything that you do as well for us as veterans.

01:53.481 --> 01:59.172
About 500 of us spread out, you know, not only in Iraq, but in Afghanistan as well.

01:59.911 --> 02:08.982
We were operating in the Al Anbar province, which is mostly all marine controlled area over there, which consists of Camp Fallujah and Al Asad.

02:10.003 --> 02:15.330
So when we first flew in, March the 10th is when we actually boots on the ground.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.551
2007.

02:16.591 --> 02:17.973
2007, correct.

02:18.053 --> 02:28.045
Our convoy security team was already in place, already conducting convoy movements training with the battalion that we were going to be relieving.

02:28.025 --> 02:31.551
I was in Camp Fallujah for approximately one month.

02:32.814 --> 02:36.059
We did have, it was just the surge was just getting started.

02:36.901 --> 02:38.744
We had a couple of mortar attacks.

02:39.045 --> 02:40.668
You know, the alarm will go off.

02:40.708 --> 02:42.831
You just hit the deck, which nobody did.

02:42.852 --> 02:44.034
Everybody pretty much just stood there.

02:44.054 --> 02:47.119
It was kind of like a fire drill at a high school or something.

02:48.381 --> 02:49.864
But, you know,

02:50.131 --> 02:56.405
The mortars were going mortars as well as then we had on outgoing artillery, which I always it was deafening.

02:56.465 --> 02:58.710
We thought we were under attack a lot when we first got there.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.275
We realized that was the Marines shooting back.

03:01.295 --> 03:01.536
Right.

03:02.618 --> 03:06.587
So I worked in the combat operations center, COC.

03:07.073 --> 03:08.414
you know, like I said, for about a month.

03:08.514 --> 03:11.537
From there, I flew to Al Asad.

03:11.877 --> 03:15.901
They wanted me to be over there, work in the COC in that theater.

03:15.941 --> 03:22.827
That's where most of our, that's where our commanding officer was at, as well as all of our operations personnel.

03:23.108 --> 03:26.951
Camp Fallujah was our Delta company, which is our air debt unit.

03:28.032 --> 03:29.493
You went by chopper, right?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.315
I went by CH-53 Super Stallion.

03:31.635 --> 03:34.498
In fact, with that trip to Camp Fallujah,

03:34.478 --> 03:36.881
We had to do a combat extract.

03:36.921 --> 03:39.906
There was all of a sudden the helo just banked on its side.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.468
We did a complete turnaround.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.409
This is in the middle of the night.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.655
You notice that there's two .50 caliber gunners.

03:46.675 --> 03:47.276
They're Marines.

03:47.296 --> 03:54.927
They're constantly scanning the area on either side of you and they're just going crazy hunting for something with these night vision goggles on.

03:55.328 --> 03:59.153
Everything is totally blacked out and we went in and

03:59.420 --> 04:04.576
landed like a Harley went straight down, came down and on board came in a bunch of Marines.

04:05.097 --> 04:09.531
They were just pulling them out of the area and we flew on like there was nothing towards the end of the tour.

04:09.882 --> 04:15.652
When it was all said and done, when I did another Hilo ride, these Marines were kicked back, relaxed.

04:15.672 --> 04:20.380
There wasn't any more of this, you know, constantly looking for something like they thought something was going to happen.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.202
Right.

04:21.262 --> 04:30.658
But in Al-Assad, you know, Camp Al-Assad, we, you know, Combat Operations Center there, monitored traffic, both air and ground movements.

04:31.162 --> 04:40.612
And I did a lot of what's called public affairs, PAO position, dealing with building our cruise book, photography, as well as some video work as well that I did.

04:40.852 --> 04:41.112
Indeed.

04:41.132 --> 04:44.015
We're going to talk a lot about that video that you did.

04:44.055 --> 04:47.699
As a matter of fact, it's going to be the creation of a couple of more shows on Veterans of the Valley.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.881
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

04:50.562 --> 04:51.623
A construction battalion.

04:51.663 --> 04:54.326
That's what CBs do, and that's what you all did.

04:54.366 --> 04:59.751
And one of the many things that you did that you talked to me about was a construction of crow's nests.

04:59.731 --> 05:08.502
Talk just a little bit about that, but not a whole lot, because we've got a clip from your video to show to the folks, but just sort of a quick, what's a crow's nest?

05:08.522 --> 05:12.226
Crow's nest is basically what you'd consider like a deer stand.

05:13.768 --> 05:19.555
They took a ballistic glass off of the Humvees, which are being phased out for the new Jerv vehicle, the MRAD vehicles.

05:19.595 --> 05:24.181
Not to go into a whole lot of, you know, it is a classified item still to this day, but they would set these up.

05:24.201 --> 05:29.367
As the Marines were pushing forward, they would set these up, you know, as a backup,

05:29.347 --> 05:34.497
Marines was sitting there and this was a major part of the surge and for success as well.

05:34.738 --> 05:37.183
So as a matter of fact, it is a classified item.

05:37.203 --> 05:45.099
And as a matter of fact, you'll be able to see in this clip that we're going to show you right now that can't show a whole lot of it or say a whole lot about it.

05:45.119 --> 05:49.708
But here's a clip from Mike Guidry's video talking about these crow's nests.

05:49.728 --> 05:51.051
Let's take a look at it right now.

05:52.516 --> 05:55.361
I'm here with MM1 Howell.

05:55.381 --> 06:02.372
Petty Officer Howell is one of the crew leads over a construction project called the Crow's Nest that we're going to talk to you about.

06:02.392 --> 06:03.735
Petty Officer Howell is from Louisiana.

06:03.855 --> 06:06.820
He's going to tell you a little bit about where he's at and what they're doing.

06:07.421 --> 06:11.448
Yes, I'm Petty Officer Howell from Mandeville, Louisiana, north of New Orleans.

06:11.888 --> 06:15.334
And the project we're working on is called the Crow's Nest.

06:15.314 --> 06:19.761
portable unit that's going to be utilized by the Marine Corps in remote locations.

06:20.182 --> 06:28.215
Provides them a lot of protection from incoming fire, both small arms and upper range weapons.

06:28.897 --> 06:37.691
The unit is somewhat of a classified item, but it's being constructed on site here with the materials that we have locally.

06:37.711 --> 06:41.237
The units that we're going to produce are going to be

06:41.217 --> 06:49.230
lifted to a vehicle, brought on site, and the lieutenant can go into more of the details as far as its security measures.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.032
Roger that.

06:50.292 --> 06:58.766
Once these units arrive on site, the idea is to be a picked-in-place security observation tower for the Marine Corps to use.

06:59.067 --> 07:05.638
And as M1 said, these are classified first protection items, so this is about the extent of what we can show.

08:00.935 --> 08:03.143
Pretty fascinating indeed.

08:03.163 --> 08:05.612
Mike, you talked about these crows nests.

08:05.632 --> 08:11.755
They would be set 100, 200 yards apart and they would be at the main supply routes or near the main supply routes.

08:11.887 --> 08:18.213
where the enemies were setting the IEDs, and the whole idea was to prevent that, right?

08:18.234 --> 08:18.914
Exactly.

08:18.934 --> 08:31.007
You know, once the Marines would move through, the problem that they would have was that the insurgents would just hide out, and then once the Marines would push through, they would set these IEDs up again, and, you know, it's like they did nothing.

08:31.027 --> 08:35.511
So with these crow's nests in place, you had a Marine or two, three, you never knew.

08:35.531 --> 08:41.117
And then also some of these crow's nests actually had silhouettes, so you never knew if there was actually someone in there or not.

08:41.097 --> 08:44.823
And of course, our Marines are trained as snipers, you know, the best in the world there.

08:44.843 --> 08:46.125
And so they would take these guys out.

08:46.145 --> 08:49.130
As soon as they saw somebody approaching there, it looked suspicious.

08:49.331 --> 08:49.671
Right.

08:49.691 --> 08:53.958
So they never appeared to be empty because if they were empty, the bad guys could blow them up.

08:54.118 --> 08:54.639
Indeed.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.803
And you didn't want that.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.809
Stationed, like you said, at La Fallujah and Al-Assad.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.255
Talk a little about, you were in communications.

09:05.036 --> 09:05.237
Correct.

09:05.277 --> 09:06.038
That was your unit.

09:06.098 --> 09:07.240
Talk about communications.

09:07.608 --> 09:11.694
Expand a little bit more on sort of what you did from the public affairs deal.

09:11.714 --> 09:17.502
We talked about the video and that there was other things you did to sort of get the good word out about what the 28th was doing, right?

09:17.522 --> 09:19.244
I did monthly newsletters.

09:19.304 --> 09:21.727
These were like family grams that were sent out back home.

09:21.847 --> 09:23.950
Very helpful to the family members.

09:24.812 --> 09:36.147
Basically what I would do though is different officers and as well as enlisted personnel would make up these family letters and I would just make them into graphics and make them suitable for

09:36.127 --> 09:44.803
you know, use on the computer for the Internet, as well as then we did the command coin as well, which you have a copy of.

09:45.124 --> 09:46.326
You know, you have.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.128
You gave me one.

09:47.168 --> 09:47.448
Thank you.

09:47.509 --> 09:47.969
There you go.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.656
And and then, of course, you know, the cruise book.

09:51.717 --> 09:52.498
But

09:52.478 --> 09:57.824
Day to day, the video was pretty much as far as the public affairs that I did.

09:58.085 --> 10:04.973
I want to make it clear that building Crow's Nest was just a very, very, very small percent of what you did in the service.

10:05.233 --> 10:11.741
You also did a lot as far as rebuilding the country, plumbing, the mundane things that have to be done to rebuild the country.

10:12.182 --> 10:17.608
And because of that, the Iraqi people, you were very popular with the Iraqi people because you were there

10:17.791 --> 10:21.176
to rebuild what war had done to them, right?

10:21.196 --> 10:21.516
Indeed.

10:21.597 --> 10:24.000
Operating in the COC, you got to see the war unfold.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.966
So, you know, I knew what was going on at all times.

10:27.986 --> 10:34.936
Never once I hear any complaints from any Iraqis that our convoy security elements, any of our CBs that are out there in the field came across.

10:35.036 --> 10:43.028
Everybody was very, very eager to talk with us, you know, share stories, thank us, you know, and then they would exchange gifts with each other.

10:43.088 --> 10:45.992
You know, it was just really fascinating, beautiful thing that went on over there.

10:46.023 --> 10:54.395
I want to go to some photographs that Mike Guidry has supplied for us here, some pictures taken while he was in Iraq.

10:54.415 --> 10:58.861
And the first picture he didn't supply for us, that is from Google Earth.

10:58.881 --> 10:59.843
Thank you to Google Earth.

10:59.863 --> 11:05.010
And this gives some sort of an idea of the map of what we're talking about.

11:05.651 --> 11:12.621
In red, you can see Baghdad, where my very amateur-looking pushpin is right there in the middle of Baghdad.

11:12.641 --> 11:13.903
And then Camp Fallujah,

11:14.474 --> 11:16.918
that would be to the west, right?

11:16.938 --> 11:18.881
I guess that would be to the west, Camp Fallujah.

11:18.901 --> 11:20.222
You can see about the distance there.

11:20.723 --> 11:26.592
And then Al-Assad is just south and west of the river.

11:26.652 --> 11:27.433
What river is that?

11:27.453 --> 11:28.294
That would be the Euphrates.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.236
The Euphrates River.

11:29.476 --> 11:29.737
Yes.

11:29.757 --> 11:40.212
So that's sort of the geography that we're talking about, about where Fallujah and Al-Assad are in relation to the capital of Baghdad.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.140
Let's go ahead and move on to the next picture.

11:43.160 --> 11:43.901
Now, there you are.

11:43.941 --> 11:45.444
There you are.

11:45.924 --> 11:46.625
You are an Aggie.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.927
We're going to talk about that later.

11:48.248 --> 11:52.173
You graduated from Sam Houston State, but you consider yourself an Aggie.

11:52.214 --> 11:54.517
You work for University Police Department.

11:54.597 --> 11:58.723
And talk about that missile.

11:58.703 --> 12:01.206
Well, this is Al Saud Air Base.

12:01.226 --> 12:04.429
It's the largest marine controlled air base in Iraq.

12:04.469 --> 12:10.957
They consist of VA-6B Prowlers, ABAB Harriers, as well as F-18D Hornets.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.819
And then they also have Helos that fly out there.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.343
This particular, this is a Harrier here with a Maverick missile up underneath.

12:16.403 --> 12:23.130
And we were just wanting to go over there and just do some photo ops and had the sticker on there and stuck it on there and forgot about it.

12:23.671 --> 12:24.972
So I went back to go retrieve it.

12:24.992 --> 12:27.495
You know, that was given to me as a gift.

12:27.475 --> 12:28.916
And it was nowhere to be found.

12:28.936 --> 12:40.447
I went back to the exact plane that I knew it was on, and they told me, well, you know, we used a few missiles and attacked some insurgents, so it probably very well is, you know, left in a house somewhere.

12:40.787 --> 12:41.048
Right.

12:41.808 --> 12:46.553
So anyway, they... So with the sticker on it, it did its job.

12:46.573 --> 12:47.814
With the sticker on it, that it did.

12:47.914 --> 12:51.918
We definitely, Aggieland said, howdy dammit to some insurgents over there.

12:52.598 --> 12:52.959
Excellent.

12:53.199 --> 12:53.539
Excellent.

12:53.679 --> 12:55.261
Okay, let's move on to the next one.

12:55.281 --> 12:56.622
There's...

12:56.602 --> 12:57.665
Showing the colors.

12:57.685 --> 12:59.510
Yep, that'll be in Camp Fallujah.

12:59.911 --> 13:02.097
We still had our Humvee vehicles there before.

13:02.257 --> 13:05.285
They were replaced with the Jerv vehicles.

13:05.345 --> 13:09.717
That was right, that was like within a week after we first got into Fallujah, right there.

13:10.810 --> 13:11.992
Okay, move on.

13:13.433 --> 13:14.134
There you are at work.

13:14.415 --> 13:15.536
This will be in the COC.

13:17.599 --> 13:19.742
We did a major construction in there as well.

13:19.762 --> 13:21.624
Everything was moved to the other side of the table there.

13:22.566 --> 13:30.456
I was the pay officer of the watch, then we had another watch officer that was on the other side, two-person integrity at all times.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.759
Basically, what you have there is these monitors there.

13:32.779 --> 13:38.248
You can't see, so that would be deemed classified, but you can see all the events that are going on.

13:38.268 --> 13:44.397
There's this little program to the right screen there that just, you know, you look up events that happened over the past 24 hours.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.179
You have what's called a Merc Chat as well.

13:46.199 --> 13:49.444
The Merc Chat is basically like your simple Yahoo Messenger.

13:49.464 --> 13:50.626
You can talk to anybody.

13:50.646 --> 13:51.567
We were able to talk to the British.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.490
We were able to talk to aircraft.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.193
We're able to call in unmanned aerial vehicles, though we never did.

13:56.794 --> 14:04.704
And then we have a system called the CPOP, which is a command post of the future, a remarkable, amazing piece of product built by General Dynamics.

14:04.944 --> 14:09.670
And we're able to see every single piece of equipment that was out there, helos as well as our convoys.

14:09.690 --> 14:11.692
And that's how we were able to track as well.

14:12.513 --> 14:17.419
And also, we were able to use what's called the...

14:18.698 --> 14:20.140
Blue Force Tracker.

14:20.500 --> 14:28.049
And that's the way we could actually communicate with our convoys through a secure line of communication just by typing out messages back and forth.

14:28.089 --> 14:31.474
So it would eliminate communications, radio communications.

14:32.174 --> 14:32.435
Okay.

14:33.456 --> 14:33.937
Good picture.

14:34.778 --> 14:36.279
This will be our Command Master Chief Fletcher.

14:37.261 --> 14:40.284
He was our highest enlisted person there.

14:41.265 --> 14:42.467
And this is the same.

14:42.767 --> 14:43.668
This is in the COC.

14:43.688 --> 14:47.473
And you can see behind you, there's the Blue Force Tracker as well as the Merc in the middle there.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.123
Okay.

14:52.444 --> 14:53.505
You with the commander?

14:53.686 --> 14:58.171
Me with Commander Sharton, who is now Captain Sharton.

14:58.191 --> 15:02.255
I'd already had this medal, but they issued me another one.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.779
This is my expert rifle on the M16 rifle.

15:05.799 --> 15:06.840
He's a Texan, is that right?

15:06.881 --> 15:07.381
That's correct.

15:07.401 --> 15:08.382
He lives in Katy, Texas.

15:08.522 --> 15:08.803
I see.

15:09.183 --> 15:09.944
Absolutely.

15:09.964 --> 15:11.886
I see.

15:11.906 --> 15:14.489
The video will really show him as quite a commander.

15:14.810 --> 15:15.250
Yes.

15:15.533 --> 15:16.194
And there you are.

15:16.234 --> 15:18.378
Tell me what kind of operation this was.

15:18.398 --> 15:19.720
This was a sighting in?

15:20.061 --> 15:22.905
This was a sighting in our weapons, getting everything ready.

15:23.006 --> 15:23.847
This was in Kuwait.

15:23.907 --> 15:25.971
When you first land, you're in Kuwait for about a month.

15:26.271 --> 15:27.473
Or no, a week rather.

15:28.014 --> 15:28.735
Seems like a month.

15:29.176 --> 15:30.819
And here we were sighting in our weapons.

15:30.879 --> 15:36.949
And as you can see, we have the headgear, the face gear over, you know, because this was a sandstorm.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.191
Horrible conditions.

15:38.211 --> 15:38.852
Oh, I can tell.

15:40.415 --> 15:41.777
That's probably...

15:42.247 --> 15:48.114
as desolate and moore as it looks in that picture, just miles and miles and miles of nothing.

15:48.134 --> 15:49.455
Yes, yes.

15:49.475 --> 15:52.158
Yeah, there was absolutely no landscape whatsoever.

15:52.298 --> 15:54.020
So this was in April?

15:55.642 --> 15:59.947
No, this would have been the beginning of March, March 1st, I would say.

16:00.247 --> 16:03.731
So not as hot as it's going to be, but still pretty warm.

16:03.751 --> 16:07.796
They said it was the coolest temperature they've had on record over there, actually.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.978
We had a lot of rain when we first got there as well.

16:11.120 --> 16:11.460
Okay.

16:13.212 --> 16:14.834
This is a picture that comes from your book.

16:14.854 --> 16:16.536
You all are mugging a little bit for the camera.

16:16.556 --> 16:17.918
You're there in the middle with the laser.

16:18.239 --> 16:18.779
That's correct.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.181
This is our communication staff.

16:20.482 --> 16:25.148
To the left, the gentleman holding up the handgun is Stuart Dinner.

16:25.168 --> 16:29.834
He works for the Texas Transportation Institute with me over here.

16:29.894 --> 16:31.136
He lives in Shire Road, Texas.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.862
Most everybody you have here is a native Texan, actually.

16:37.259 --> 16:43.241
And to the far right with the Kevlar on is our S6, who is our communications officer.

16:43.261 --> 16:46.413
And behind him is Ernie Limone, who is our comm chief.

16:46.654 --> 16:48.461
I see.

16:48.481 --> 16:48.822
Okay.

16:49.358 --> 16:51.581
And there's you and your lovely bride.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.483
The beautiful bride, that's right.

16:53.863 --> 16:55.105
This is my wife, Audrey.

16:56.046 --> 16:59.950
This is out of her grandparents' home off of Elma Whedon Road.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.091
This is our welcome home party.

17:01.292 --> 17:02.753
They surprised me with a cake.

17:03.014 --> 17:05.196
There's the command coin there on the cake.

17:05.777 --> 17:06.237
Indeed.

17:06.257 --> 17:08.620
And she works for Texas A&M over at Teese, right?

17:08.640 --> 17:12.244
She works at Teese, graphic designer, over at the Weissenbaker building.

17:14.654 --> 17:18.861
Now, we're going to talk a little bit about this, but you have a hobby that you are just excellent at.

17:18.901 --> 17:23.870
I was at your office the other day, and you like to put together model airplanes, and you are pretty darn good at it.

17:23.970 --> 17:24.631
Well, thank you.

17:24.651 --> 17:28.518
These are just some of your models of some of these jet fighters.

17:28.538 --> 17:30.040
We went through that one real quick.

17:30.260 --> 17:34.488
But this one is the one that's just really impressive of this carrier, the Enterprise.

17:34.568 --> 17:37.072
Yeah, that'll be the Vietnam version of the Enterprise.

17:37.112 --> 17:38.555
It's about a 1970 version.

17:38.595 --> 17:40.037
I've got an air wing on there.

17:40.017 --> 17:45.128
They're, you know, they've since modernized it with a different island structure.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.751
Of course, different aircraft.

17:46.772 --> 17:49.357
I don't think any of those aircraft are even in service anymore.

17:49.858 --> 17:52.744
Well, except for the E-2 Hawkeye, you see on the bottom right there on the ground.

17:52.985 --> 17:54.448
So about how many hours of

17:54.766 --> 17:58.453
of fun did this take you to do this, would you say?

17:58.593 --> 18:02.921
This is the biggest stress reliever that I've ever had.

18:02.961 --> 18:06.167
Whenever you're unstressed, the ship itself is quick.

18:06.187 --> 18:07.189
Get that knocked down a week.

18:07.249 --> 18:10.134
The planes, however, you work on one of those a day.

18:10.254 --> 18:10.795
The detail.

18:11.056 --> 18:11.697
Oh, absolutely.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.380
And that's where my stress relief.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.522
I'm sitting there working.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.247
A lot of these came from Iraq, actually.

18:17.429 --> 18:23.039
I worked on these while I was over there just to, you know, again, just to relieve stress and have something different to do.

18:24.001 --> 18:25.564
They are really fascinating.

18:25.584 --> 18:28.089
This final picture is you and a gentleman.

18:28.109 --> 18:29.070
I want to leave that up there.

18:29.712 --> 18:35.823
People who have been watching Veterans of the Valley remember the very first CB that I had on Veterans of the Valley.

18:35.843 --> 18:37.266
His name is James Rothermel.

18:37.306 --> 18:38.087
He is from Brenham.

18:38.523 --> 18:40.245
And that is the gentleman on the left.

18:40.265 --> 18:42.047
He's been a guest here.

18:42.067 --> 18:51.919
And you actually, I'm gonna let you tell the story because it involves my radio show actually that I did with James Rothermel and how you came to meet him.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.703
Listened to WTAW in the morning there.

18:55.103 --> 18:57.466
I just happened to hear CB and kept listening in.

18:57.566 --> 19:00.109
You were honoring him at Caulfield.

19:00.089 --> 19:17.372
and this would have been in the fall of 2006, and I was gonna be deploying in January to California, so I got in touch with you, and you were more than happy to give me his contact information, got in contact with him, kept in contact with him while in Iraq, sent him a flag that was flown over al-Assad,

19:17.352 --> 19:21.419
And he gave me the most amazing gift.

19:21.479 --> 19:27.309
It was a little pin from World War II that his mother gave him while he was overseas.

19:27.329 --> 19:28.872
So he gave that to me.

19:28.892 --> 19:30.755
And this was just the greatest honor.

19:30.775 --> 19:31.877
I will treasure this always.

19:31.917 --> 19:39.791
This is now in a display case with all my medals, everything that I received while I was in Iraq, as well as a flag that flew over Al-Assad.

19:39.851 --> 19:42.516
I sent him a flag, as I said, from Al-Assad.

19:42.496 --> 19:47.367
They surprised me at the party over there at the Borski home, and there he was.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.733
He was the first person I shook hands with, actually.

19:49.753 --> 19:55.105
I went straight up to him and knew exactly who he was, and I gave him a CB Combat Warfare pin, actually.

19:55.844 --> 20:03.634
Well, I'll tell you what, this show has been able to get you guys together, and our work with veterans has been able to get you guys together right there.

20:03.674 --> 20:05.356
That just makes it all worth it right there.

20:05.917 --> 20:06.497
Absolutely.

20:06.517 --> 20:06.978
God bless you for that.

20:06.998 --> 20:13.126
And James Rothermel was a CB in the Pacific, as a matter of fact, and had a great story to tell.

20:13.146 --> 20:16.129
As a matter of fact, you'll probably be seeing a repeat of that show here before very long.

20:17.251 --> 20:20.755
Mike, I asked you this the other day, and I'm going to let you sort of address it.

20:21.494 --> 20:27.887
what would you say is the biggest misconception that we in the United States have about the war from the media reports?

20:28.849 --> 20:36.343
What would you like to, if you had a microphone to the entire country and could say, no, it's not really like that, it's like this, what would you say?

20:39.850 --> 20:43.317
Before I deployed over there, I didn't have a favorite

20:43.752 --> 20:45.895
TV station, it's my favorite news outlet.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.717
I'd watch pretty much anything.

20:47.737 --> 20:54.184
From now on, all I watch is Fox News, because that is fair and balanced, and that's the way it is, plain and simple.

20:55.966 --> 20:59.931
Sean Hannity, WTAW, with Neil Bortz.

21:00.732 --> 21:10.283
These guys tell how it is, and I cannot say anymore that that's the way it is, what they put out there.

21:10.263 --> 21:14.993
People need to understand that what we see on the news is shown over there.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.600
Not just to the servicemen, but to the Iraqi people.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.201
They see that.

21:19.221 --> 21:28.761
So when you have certain people in office who tell us the surge isn't working, they'll never work, I was never for this.

21:29.028 --> 21:30.650
I could go, well, you know where I'm going.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.195
I'm not going to go too much into it, but they see that.

21:34.916 --> 21:40.082
And that gets people like me and my buddies over there, men and women killed.

21:40.102 --> 21:46.791
So I am, you know, I get very passionate when, you know, I hear a certain people of a political party.

21:47.132 --> 21:48.994
Well, it empowers the enemy.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.716
Empowers them, gives them motivation.

21:50.756 --> 21:52.399
They're like, yeah, we're winning this.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.682
Listen to what they're saying back home.

21:54.702 --> 21:54.882
Right.

21:55.563 --> 21:57.866
And that right there, it's getting people killed over there.

21:57.986 --> 21:59.108
The war was over in 2003.

21:59.268 --> 22:01.451
We accomplished, mission accomplished.

22:01.932 --> 22:04.615
And then, where's the weapons of mass destruction?

22:04.835 --> 22:05.376
Right.

22:05.396 --> 22:08.140
You know, which, yeah, they're there.

22:09.181 --> 22:13.047
That's a whole other speech that you can give.

22:13.087 --> 22:13.948
We won't go into that.

22:13.988 --> 22:14.889
Yeah.

22:15.650 --> 22:17.833
Five more years in your

22:18.151 --> 22:27.169
in this latest, since you re-up the last time, and then you'll have your 20 and the next deployment in 2010 headed to Afghanistan.

22:27.189 --> 22:28.291
What are your thoughts about that?

22:28.532 --> 22:29.012
Ready to go.

22:29.353 --> 22:34.423
The wife and I, you know, there's a, we need to have a baby.

22:34.443 --> 22:35.986
You know, we both want a child.

22:36.046 --> 22:39.433
We're in the process of getting a home right now.

22:40.747 --> 22:46.718
And that's something we're going to need to really work on, you know, and it's still, you don't know what's going to happen around the corner.

22:46.738 --> 22:54.372
2003, we were supposed to be, the NFCB 28 was to invade from the north from Turkey.

22:54.392 --> 22:57.017
And our air day, you know, went out to Guam.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.745
And we were two weeks away from being deployed, but then they shut us, and then Turkey denied us from launching a ground assault.

23:02.765 --> 23:04.567
So that kind of was a full-scale deployment for all of us.

23:05.027 --> 23:08.851
Those 120 people had to stay over there for a year.

23:08.891 --> 23:09.512
We stayed back.

23:09.592 --> 23:10.833
So you never know what's going to happen.

23:11.994 --> 23:15.197
But if they call me right now, yeah, we're on it.

23:15.217 --> 23:18.261
And my wife has been more than supportive, as well as my family and friends.

23:18.801 --> 23:20.623
They're behind me 100%, no matter what.

23:21.203 --> 23:22.945
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

23:23.045 --> 23:26.869
Just knowing you for the short time that I have, it doesn't surprise me that you're ready to go.

23:27.338 --> 23:37.828
I want to talk about, and you're anxious to talk about, that the Seabees, besides doing what they do overseas, they're doing things right here in the United States, and not only in the United States, right here at Bryan College Station.

23:38.088 --> 23:44.855
Talk a little bit about sort of what people can drive around our town right now and see that is really the result of Seabees' work.

23:44.915 --> 23:51.841
Look at the corner 2018 and the entrance to Easterwood Airport over there at Georgia Bush Drive, that obstacle course there, we built that in 2001.

23:52.001 --> 23:55.725
I received my first Naval Achievement Medal from that, actually.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.488
And we're going to do phase two here pretty quick, actually.

23:58.508 --> 24:01.851
And in fact, I got something for you here, actually.

24:01.891 --> 24:02.652
What did I do with that?

24:05.295 --> 24:06.175
Is there something coming?

24:06.376 --> 24:06.776
Oh, okay.

24:06.796 --> 24:07.457
What do we got here?

24:07.517 --> 24:08.137
Oh, my goodness.

24:09.579 --> 24:10.820
This is my first gift.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.562
Three years, and this is my first gift.

24:12.982 --> 24:15.004
There's your deployment T-shirt there.

24:15.765 --> 24:16.666
Oh, my goodness.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.086
Look at that.

24:17.106 --> 24:18.508
You see that warfare pin on the front.

24:18.548 --> 24:19.228
Oh, my goodness.

24:19.248 --> 24:20.430
I've been set up.

24:20.450 --> 24:20.970
Look at that.

24:21.190 --> 24:21.791
Oh, look at that.

24:21.831 --> 24:23.873
He gave me a coin the other day.

24:24.325 --> 24:28.749
And now I've got a shirt with my coin on the back.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.030
That'll be our deployment t-shirt.

24:30.070 --> 24:32.492
But again, going back to the obstacle course.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.433
Thank you very much.

24:33.453 --> 24:33.653
Yeah.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.836
With that obstacle course, we're going to have two large towers visible.

24:36.856 --> 24:40.580
They're about 50 foot tall, rope tower going from one tower to the other.

24:41.080 --> 24:41.200
Right.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.882
So that'll be visible for miles around.

24:42.902 --> 24:48.327
It'll be definitely another structural site here for the Bryan College Station area.

24:48.887 --> 24:49.107
Wow.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.970
So once we get that completed, that's just one small part of it.

24:51.950 --> 24:52.932
That is fantastic.

24:53.192 --> 25:01.766
You came home in 2007, kind of had a hard time finding a job, and now you are working for Texas A&M at TTI.

25:01.806 --> 25:04.250
Talk a little bit about what you're doing there.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.112
You're a research associate.

25:05.132 --> 25:06.173
Right, research associate.

25:06.214 --> 25:11.342
We deal a lot with a lot of our funding comes from TxDOT, federal grants as well.

25:11.322 --> 25:28.622
wonderful lady by the name of Katie Womack is my supervisor over there and like most recently one of our projects was the clicker ticket campaign we'll actually go out stand on a street corner see who's wearing their seat belts in the front seat you know front passenger as well as a driver we'll collect the age the race

25:28.602 --> 25:31.206
We do this both at nighttime and during the daytime.

25:31.286 --> 25:34.430
This will be just all to see how effective the clicker ticket campaign is.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.594
We'll go out and talk to kids about seat belt safety as well.

25:37.915 --> 25:41.179
We're visiting several different schools throughout the state of Texas.

25:41.720 --> 25:46.947
So it's definitely a big change from, you know, working, you know, I did a security officer for UPD for 10 years.

25:47.288 --> 25:48.309
Wonderful experience there.

25:48.349 --> 25:52.034
It was the first time I ever met you actually during some of your sporting events over there.

25:52.174 --> 25:53.496
So all that time with

25:53.645 --> 25:58.232
A&M 10 years has carried over, so we're on our way to retirement with this as well.

25:58.253 --> 25:58.833
That's wonderful.

25:59.615 --> 26:01.358
Mike joined the Navy in 1993.

26:01.738 --> 26:04.703
He went to Orlando to Navy boot camp.

26:04.723 --> 26:11.354
He came back and he served for 10 years, I believe, as a security officer at University Police Department.

26:11.394 --> 26:13.898
You finished at Blinn and then got your

26:14.198 --> 26:17.161
degree at Sam Houston State, and that's where you met your wife, Audrey.

26:17.181 --> 26:18.363
That's where I met my wife, Audrey.

26:18.763 --> 26:19.945
And then it was on to the service.

26:20.225 --> 26:20.926
We're out of time.

26:21.026 --> 26:22.388
Thank you very much for your service.

26:22.528 --> 26:25.371
But we're going to be visiting with you in later episodes.

26:25.391 --> 26:27.073
Thank you, Mike Guidry.

26:27.093 --> 26:35.463
Mike Guidry is one of thousands of young men and women who put their life on hold to serve you and me in this war, and he is ready to go back when called.

26:35.483 --> 26:43.412
His video is a remarkable depiction of the camaraderie and, yes, the humor that prevails in a very difficult and stressful and sometimes dangerous war.

26:43.730 --> 26:47.234
We will feature his video in upcoming episodes of Veterans of the Valley.

26:47.675 --> 26:52.500
We salute Mike Guidry of the 28th Seabees for his service now and in the future.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.461
I'm Tom Turberville.

26:53.481 --> 27:10.581
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:11.050 --> 27:20.638
Amen.

27:38.860 --> 27:45.681
In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family
