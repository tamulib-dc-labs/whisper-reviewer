00:00.031 --> 00:04.355
And it was off to our first stop, the World War II Veterans Memorial.

00:05.156 --> 00:13.204
Frank Litterst is Texas A&M class of 1943, an Army artillery officer who was wounded in the Pacific campaign.

00:13.765 --> 00:15.406
It's a beautiful tribute, Tom.

00:16.968 --> 00:19.110
It's more than I expected.

00:19.130 --> 00:23.014
And I think it's wonderful that they do that for us.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.257
I know a lot of us chipped in and helped build this.

00:26.957 --> 00:28.519
Never had seen it before.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.090
and I'm really impressed with it.

00:31.991 --> 00:38.838
It's saddened that those that got killed aren't here to see it today.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.062
It's a wonderful tribute.

00:45.105 --> 00:49.770
I get tore up a little bit, sentimental, but I can't help it in any way.

00:49.790 --> 00:57.898
I appreciate all you guys do and everything to promote this wonderful trip.
