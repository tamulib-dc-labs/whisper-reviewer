00:00.031 --> 00:26.241
as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:33.646 --> 00:37.450
Thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.573
He was born in Idaho and he lived in Michigan.

00:40.093 --> 00:45.339
And he was attending Michigan State University when they heard someplace called Pearl Harbor had been attacked.

00:45.760 --> 00:51.746
He didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was, but he did just about what every other able-bodied young man did.

00:51.766 --> 00:55.871
He enlisted, thinking the war would be over before he got there.

00:55.891 --> 00:57.132
Little did he know.

00:57.152 --> 01:00.216
Veterans of the Valley welcomes Bill Pope to today's show.

01:00.476 --> 01:01.477
Bill, thank you for joining us.

01:01.497 --> 01:02.218
Glad to be here.

01:02.688 --> 01:06.778
What was it like when you heard Pearl Harbor was bombed and you enlisted?

01:06.838 --> 01:07.821
Take us from that point.

01:07.841 --> 01:11.550
It was sort of confusion as far as the people were concerned.

01:11.570 --> 01:16.984
As you say, they were aware that we were in Hawaii, but they had no other idea what was happening.

01:17.004 --> 01:19.009
And then, of course, the way it was handled.

01:19.259 --> 01:25.626
was the thing that really excited a lot of people to settle up this thing and get it straight.

01:25.646 --> 01:33.135
And so there were a lot of heroes that came out of this, a lot of heroes that weren't known about and didn't receive the plaudits that perhaps they should.

01:33.455 --> 01:33.575
Right.

01:33.595 --> 01:36.438
It was more or less a war that pretty much changed the face of our country.

01:36.458 --> 01:36.819
That's right.

01:37.159 --> 01:39.502
And the livelihood of it and so forth.

01:39.862 --> 01:40.923
But take us through your training.

01:40.943 --> 01:42.906
Where all did you go real quick for training?

01:42.926 --> 01:48.692
Well, we all looked around, you know, for the one that we thought would be the most damaging to the enemy.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.577
There were things like the Merchant Marine.

01:51.057 --> 01:55.522
The Marine Corps was one of the ones that everybody enjoyed, was proud of.

01:56.163 --> 01:59.166
The Army was kind of down the list, but that's where many of them showed up.

01:59.186 --> 02:07.074
And the Air Corps, most of us didn't believe that we could enter the Corps, that we were good enough, both physically and otherwise.

02:07.094 --> 02:14.562
And so consequently, when my roommate said, let's go down to Lansing and see if we can get in the Air Corps, I kind of shrugged it off.

02:15.132 --> 02:18.057
And what turned out was that he didn't make it, and I did.

02:18.978 --> 02:19.960
So we started out.

02:20.541 --> 02:28.714
So then we were put in another world that we hadn't realized, but one that I think did a lot for veterans as much as what they did for the others.

02:28.734 --> 02:30.917
And you were all of 20, 21 at that time?

02:30.937 --> 02:31.739
21, yeah.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.345
Ready to try everything, you know, that came along.

02:35.505 --> 02:37.288
You had the tiger by the tail, more or less.

02:37.548 --> 02:38.710
You were ready to go at it.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.694
And of course, we were a little puzzled by what they did at the beginning.

02:41.714 --> 02:45.700
They took our group and put them clear down in Florida.

02:46.501 --> 02:52.730
In fact, in Miami for a while, as a kind of a stockpile of cadets that they could use.

02:52.750 --> 03:01.542
And then after that, went up to Pennsylvania to a junior college there, still as a group, still a long way from piloting a plane.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.529
and then finally went back to San Antonio, and then finally after that went north.

03:06.589 --> 03:12.461
So one thing we could never understand about the Army was their logic and moving these things around.

03:12.481 --> 03:13.463
Constantly moving them around, huh?

03:13.483 --> 03:14.786
That's right.

03:15.207 --> 03:19.015
Tell us, you have an interesting story about some flight training.

03:19.035 --> 03:21.640
I believe it was on May 13th of 43.

03:21.620 --> 03:22.481
Was that the right date?

03:22.521 --> 03:23.322
Maybe 12th?

03:23.823 --> 03:28.049
Well, yeah, I had several bouts of them, you might say.

03:28.109 --> 03:35.761
When we were there near Clarion College near Pittsburgh, they gave us our first rides in airplanes.

03:35.801 --> 03:37.724
I'd never been in one before and on.

03:37.744 --> 03:42.090
These were Piper Cubs, and you really get a sensation of flying in a Piper Cub.

03:42.110 --> 03:44.113
That's the old stick type.

03:44.133 --> 03:51.103
So as we were going out one day with this fellow, a storm came up, and he had to land that thing through a couple of trees.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.607
It just about took us off.

03:53.627 --> 03:57.332
So I began to see that there were some hazards as far as flying was concerned.

03:58.113 --> 03:58.994
But it gets in your blood.

03:59.435 --> 03:59.835
Absolutely.

04:00.436 --> 04:05.703
Tell us about, you have a quick little story about basically Lake Worth.

04:06.304 --> 04:12.653
And a lot of people around here won't know that, but obviously it made the Fort Worth Star-Telegram from a long time ago.

04:12.683 --> 04:14.285
This was the most unusual thing.

04:14.305 --> 04:17.049
This was in the latter part of our training mission.

04:17.069 --> 04:19.413
We were flying B-24s at that particular time.

04:21.015 --> 04:24.060
We left for the evening to do some night work.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.922
They wanted us to do a lot of flying at night.

04:26.063 --> 04:32.532
We got up northeast of Dallas and Fort Worth in that quadrant area up there and started back.

04:32.815 --> 04:44.328
They had the instructor pilot and the other student pilot and myself, and we also had an engineer that went with us, which is required because they wanted somebody to do the plane and so forth.

04:44.989 --> 04:51.416
We came down in on the east side of what is Fort Worth now, and of course everything was still lit up at that particular time.

04:52.237 --> 04:57.523
And since the other student pilot had done the takeoff, it was up to me to land it.

04:57.925 --> 04:59.808
and so we were doing the flying then.

04:59.828 --> 05:09.122
We made a circle around the south side of Fort Worth and made the base leg that would put us across where the runway should be.

05:09.262 --> 05:10.364
More or less like the approach?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.307
Yeah, well lighted at that time.

05:13.128 --> 05:20.119
And so I made the turn and was then going kind of across where the runway would be

05:20.690 --> 05:25.980
And we had some flaps down in the wing, and we had our gear down.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.948
So all of the things moved hydraulically were dropped down.

05:29.968 --> 05:36.200
And so I made the turn and lined up with a runway, which is perfectly set as far as I was concerned.

05:36.220 --> 05:37.523
What was your altitude about now?

05:37.543 --> 05:40.047
Well, we were probably only about a couple thousand feet at that time.

05:40.067 --> 05:43.474
We were going to lose right into the runway itself.

05:43.977 --> 05:55.670
and I felt this kind of tug on the controls and that wasn't unusual because sometime the instructor pilot would pull an engine on you to get you used to that sort of thing.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.311
See how you reacted in situations.

05:57.331 --> 06:07.082
And so when that happened I wasn't too concerned but I know that he was and he was in the other seat and I looked through his window and there was flames coming out of the engine.

06:07.703 --> 06:12.569
That was a number three engine, which is right up against the fuselage on the right.

06:12.590 --> 06:13.531
On the co-pilot side.

06:13.551 --> 06:19.739
Yeah, and one of the real problems of that, Carl, is that that is the engine that has the hydraulic system.

06:20.340 --> 06:20.580
Oh, okay.

06:20.600 --> 06:26.488
And so of all four, if you didn't want an engine to go out, number three was the one that you wanted to do the last.

06:26.823 --> 06:33.352
So I realized then that we were in trouble, and we had our gear down and our flaps down, and we had no hydraulic way to handle anything.

06:33.372 --> 06:35.916
So you also had a lot of drag because you had flaps down and gears down.

06:35.936 --> 06:40.843
And this, we were over Lake Worth at that time, which is just on the west side of Fort Worth.

06:41.504 --> 06:51.037
So we were moving around in a circle there, and the controls were getting awful mushy, and the airspeed was really dropping down.

06:51.057 --> 06:54.282
And then all of a sudden, the instructor pilot said, this is it.

06:54.683 --> 06:58.188
So he pretty much knew something just from your airspeed dropping.

06:58.208 --> 07:00.130
Yeah, I knew something was going to come up.

07:00.831 --> 07:04.976
We had to get the flaps and gear on if we were going to land.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.462
But I'll say in a minute that may have been the worst thing we could have done was to have landed.

07:09.482 --> 07:16.371
We were out over the water at that time in this lake and all of a sudden you could feel the plane dropping.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.485
And that's the last thing I knew.

07:19.045 --> 07:22.330
And the next thing I knew... And it dropped from what, about 1500 feet, 1200 feet?

07:22.430 --> 07:24.132
We must have been at least 1000 feet.

07:24.352 --> 07:25.854
We were letting down at that time.

07:25.874 --> 07:26.595
That's pretty far away.

07:26.775 --> 07:27.116
That's right.

07:28.057 --> 07:31.681
So we were then in a real pickle at that time.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.446
We were over this lake and we'd lost our airspeed and we were stalled out.

07:36.407 --> 07:37.889
And that's the last that I remember.

07:38.650 --> 07:44.738
And the next thing I remember was that I was sitting in my seat in the water up to my waist.

07:44.937 --> 07:45.858
Wow, down below.

07:46.959 --> 07:57.090
And you're just so dulled at that time, you don't know what the situation might be, but you knew it was a serious thing, but you're still alive, whole thing.

07:57.790 --> 08:09.763
I remember underbuckling my belt and standing up in the water about to my waist, and there was a plane up ahead of me, rolled up on its back, the two landing gear floating straight up,

08:10.148 --> 08:14.057
and the pictures they have in the paper is exactly what I saw on that.

08:14.798 --> 08:29.811
So I started to wade ashore and there was a lot of debris all scattered through the lake and I was wading, kind of winding myself along and yelled for help and suddenly lights came on and the cottages that were near that shore

08:30.483 --> 08:35.497
And I got close to the bank and a couple of arms went down and dragged me up out of the water and so forth.

08:35.637 --> 08:38.826
So you crashed pretty close to shore right next to a cottage developer.

08:38.846 --> 08:39.146
That's right.

08:39.267 --> 08:39.688
That's right.

08:39.788 --> 08:45.704
In fact, the wing of one of our planes went right through a building right up above where a fellow was sleeping in the cottage.

08:45.724 --> 08:46.045
Goodness.

08:46.514 --> 08:51.943
And as I say, the rest of it was just completely crumpled up and so forth.

08:52.463 --> 08:53.785
The plane was on its back.

08:53.926 --> 08:57.812
It was just like you'd taken it and just tortured it.

08:58.152 --> 09:02.680
And actually one service man did lose his life, but three of you survived that fall from a thousand feet.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.342
Alvin Powell was the engineer.

09:04.983 --> 09:11.193
And I think that he was down in the bomb bay trying to get an auxiliary pump going so we'd have some hydraulic pressure.

09:12.034 --> 09:13.396
So he was doing his duty.

09:13.537 --> 09:14.378
He was from Portland.

09:14.881 --> 09:17.166
and he was the one that lost his life.

09:17.967 --> 09:30.493
I found out that also the other pilot, a student pilot, was thrown clear on down on the beach and lived, and also the instructor pilot, believe it or not, was thrown on top of a house.

09:31.064 --> 09:36.450
because I remember walking by and seeing him sitting on top of the house and I thought this is a crazy thing.

09:37.972 --> 09:51.227
But then by that time the lights had come on and of course they knew back at the base that we'd had trouble and so they sent a couple ambulances out to get us and load us up and take us out on the thing.

09:52.248 --> 09:58.255
So you've been through an ordeal like that and basically you just have to keep going.

09:58.275 --> 09:58.716
That's right.

09:58.956 --> 10:00.818
That's right, yeah.

10:01.085 --> 10:05.250
They couldn't believe when they picked me up that I didn't have some internal injury.

10:05.910 --> 10:11.797
And I know they got me back to the base there and I took every x-ray they could make and so forth.

10:12.317 --> 10:17.823
The only thing was that my ankle was a little bit scarred and I had a cut above my eye.

10:18.644 --> 10:21.047
And that's the only two things that I had at that time.

10:21.067 --> 10:23.830
After falling from, what, a thousand feet or so in a B-24.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.852
So it's incredible that it ever got out.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.375
And I've often thought that you look back on it

10:28.996 --> 10:34.890
If we would have made the runway, as soon as that slipstream was gone, that place would have blown up.

10:34.910 --> 10:40.382
And if we'd have landed farther out in the lake, the B-24, you enter in through the bomb bay.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.645
Right, on the belly side.

10:42.006 --> 10:44.271
Yeah, which would already be underwater.

10:44.977 --> 10:53.533
And if you'd gone farther toward the land, you'd not only put yourself out, but you'd have had tremendous fire and so forth when the fluid.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.639
You could have gone into that cottage complex instead of into the edge of the water.

10:56.659 --> 11:04.133
So when you look back at it, and I've done it a thousand times, there was no other way that you could have got out of that plane.

11:04.433 --> 11:08.239
That has to be one in a million or one in an astronomical amount.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.201
It must be on that.

11:09.462 --> 11:10.583
It was all unplanned.

11:10.904 --> 11:11.866
It was one of those things.

11:11.926 --> 11:17.976
Those things happened in warfare to fellows that were on the front lines, you know, and so forth.

11:17.996 --> 11:25.168
So that was quite an experience, and that was right before we checked out our crews and got ready to go across sea.

11:25.188 --> 11:25.449
Okay.

11:25.729 --> 11:27.612
So where did you go to build your crew?

11:28.253 --> 11:30.357
Well, we went to...

11:30.674 --> 11:43.148
first up to there at Fort Worth and on up into Nebraska, and they'd assigned you radio operators, they assigned you mechanical people, people that were gunners and so forth.

11:43.550 --> 11:44.572
Then we went to Idaho.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.597
And a B-24 crew is what, 10 people?

11:47.617 --> 11:48.959
Yeah.

11:49.600 --> 11:55.730
And then in Idaho, that was mostly for gunnery training and formation training and things like that.

11:56.551 --> 11:59.275
But it's great for me because I had relatives in Idaho.

11:59.335 --> 12:00.157
That's where I was born.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.238
Yeah, you were back home.

12:01.839 --> 12:04.504
So I thoroughly enjoyed that as we got to it.

12:04.524 --> 12:09.051
But that's where you put together a team, and it's amazing how that team stays together.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.073
at least during the war.

12:11.093 --> 12:15.702
You lose them after the war, but they see a real responsibility.

12:16.303 --> 12:20.913
So when you finally got over to Europe, into England, where were you stationed at?

12:20.933 --> 12:24.259
Well, we were stationed at a little place called Wendling.

12:24.279 --> 12:28.468
And the Eighth Air Force, as you say, had I don't know how many planes.

12:28.488 --> 12:29.470
Well, later on,

12:29.939 --> 12:33.184
We joined them, they had a thousand planes they put up.

12:33.204 --> 12:36.229
Real quick, isn't Windling somewhat north of London?

12:36.249 --> 12:38.893
Yeah, about 50 miles north of London.

12:38.913 --> 12:41.637
A small village and of course all that around there.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.843
We went in and built about 25 or 30 air bases.

12:46.785 --> 12:54.276
And one of the advantages of that East Anglia position in Britain, which is right above London,

12:54.779 --> 13:00.710
is that you can do all your maneuvers and getting together and everything over the North Sea.

13:00.730 --> 13:11.691
So you don't then get in any trouble, you might say, that you can't handle if you get in the North Sea, which is not the thing to try because it wouldn't last long.

13:11.711 --> 13:15.538
So really what they put together then was a very efficient program

13:16.261 --> 13:24.993
And I look back on it and wonder, our particular wing there had three squadrons.

13:25.694 --> 13:33.966
Each squadron would have 10 or more planes, and there'd be three of those wings in each part

13:34.537 --> 13:41.394
And you could see before you got through, they could mount some mighty devastating things from that.

13:41.474 --> 13:47.710
Of course, we didn't have the atomic bomb or anything else, but we could play a pretty heavy load on that area.

13:47.790 --> 13:50.757
We've got some pictures that you were

13:50.737 --> 13:51.978
nice enough to loan us.

13:51.998 --> 13:59.446
And some of them are even, you and your wife, I believe, went back to England to see that old airfield and a monument.

13:59.626 --> 14:02.289
And I think we've got some pictures of that along with, there we go.

14:02.449 --> 14:04.991
And now that is a sharp looking service man out there.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.793
That's younger on that, Kyle.

14:07.954 --> 14:08.815
Where was this photo?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.317
Was this your official?

14:10.337 --> 14:16.523
Oh, that must have been when we were there at Fort Worth at the Carsville base out there.

14:17.564 --> 14:18.685
You're a handsome looking soldier.

14:19.036 --> 14:22.160
And this is just before we left to go to England.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.244
We had come back from Idaho and we were at Topeka, Kansas of all places.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.907
Now, is that actually your 24 that you're sitting in front of?

14:29.027 --> 14:31.130
No, that was just one that had to be parked in the field.

14:31.150 --> 14:32.351
One that had to be parked there, okay.

14:33.032 --> 14:33.793
But that is your crew.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.154
And where are you at in that picture?

14:35.174 --> 14:37.337
Well, over here, squatted on the right.

14:38.338 --> 14:38.658
Oh, okay.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.739
Down, you're squatting down.

14:39.759 --> 14:42.102
The center was Snow Hill, my co-pilot.

14:42.222 --> 14:44.925
And to the left was Bernstein, the navigator.

14:45.428 --> 14:48.492
And so you can look at a place like that and you just count off with the word.

14:48.772 --> 14:49.253
Wow.

14:49.954 --> 14:50.815
That's really great.

14:50.835 --> 14:54.119
And unfortunately, with the exception of one or two, that's about all.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.701
That's all that's left.

14:55.761 --> 14:56.642
Where was this picture taken?

14:56.662 --> 15:00.467
Oh, that was back in Michigan, where her mother had a lot of roses there by her milk house.

15:00.808 --> 15:03.872
And that was during the time when I had a little leaves and so forth.

15:04.072 --> 15:04.973
OK.

15:05.813 --> 15:14.929
And you can imagine how they felt when they got a telegram that morning that said that they'd been in a car accident, a plane accident.

15:15.690 --> 15:18.835
And of course, then the question was, are you still alive?

15:18.855 --> 15:29.093
And you know, at that time, the person that was handling the telegraph and so forth to show you how people pulled together, he told mother before he told her what had happened.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.876
He said, this is going to be all right.

15:31.447 --> 15:36.756
And you know they went out of their way to kind of help the people back home as to what might happen.

15:37.116 --> 15:37.917
I can understand that.

15:38.258 --> 15:39.420
Let's go back to the pictures.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.702
I believe now we're going to start looking.

15:40.982 --> 15:41.824
This is the monument.

15:42.144 --> 15:42.725
Yes.

15:43.246 --> 15:55.125
After we left and abandoned that base, which is several years after the war was over, then all the veterans got together and put the money together to have a

15:55.814 --> 15:58.358
recognition of what the people were there.

15:58.779 --> 16:03.586
See, there were 760 people that lost their lives out of that base alone.

16:03.606 --> 16:03.847
Wow.

16:03.867 --> 16:04.848
Just that one airport.

16:05.008 --> 16:06.971
Now, were those Americans or was that also RAF?

16:06.991 --> 16:07.893
No, just Americans.

16:07.933 --> 16:08.514
Just Americans.

16:08.554 --> 16:09.495
Uh-huh.

16:09.515 --> 16:16.146
But you stop and think of all the loss that you have of people and it's unbelievable.

16:16.166 --> 16:23.337
It's always nice to have that monument there at Wendling and it was poised right at the end of the runway where we used to take off.

16:23.758 --> 16:23.998
Wow.

16:24.282 --> 16:28.488
And now the runway was farmed, actually, and lost.

16:28.508 --> 16:31.151
We have a picture of one of the old runways, I believe.

16:31.171 --> 16:38.602
And consequently, this was what it looked like now after we had gone many a plane about that particular deal.

16:39.202 --> 16:41.165
If that runway could talk, more or less, I guess, yeah.

16:41.245 --> 16:41.746
Oh, it could.

16:42.046 --> 16:42.687
It surely could.

16:43.088 --> 16:43.668
Good and bad.

16:44.049 --> 16:45.571
Yeah, exactly.

16:46.012 --> 16:49.176
See, when we took off with one of those loaded planes,

16:49.730 --> 16:53.839
We had about 2,000 gallons of petrol, high octane gas.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.585
We had about three tons of bombs.

16:56.605 --> 16:58.168
Those were 500 pound bombs, weren't they, I think?

16:58.208 --> 16:58.890
Yeah.

16:58.910 --> 17:03.199
And then we had all the ammunition for each one of the people there.

17:03.736 --> 17:05.218
And several other things, too.

17:05.419 --> 17:11.708
So when a plane took off, they had to have pretty good structure to be able to make the takeoff that they wanted.

17:11.728 --> 17:12.309
Oh, absolutely.

17:13.170 --> 17:15.173
Okay, and this looks like an old Quonset hut.

17:15.193 --> 17:17.196
Was this basically your barracks back then?

17:17.216 --> 17:21.643
It probably was, or it might have been one where we had our briefings before we left.

17:22.417 --> 17:26.741
And the briefings, when you started out that morning, you had no idea where you were going to bomb.

17:27.342 --> 17:27.462
Right.

17:27.482 --> 17:33.088
But then when you got in it, they had a ribbon that started with our base and might go clear out to the other end.

17:33.108 --> 17:35.811
And that was the one that you were going to take out that particular day.

17:36.412 --> 17:42.378
And I'll never forget the time I walked in and one of them went to Berlin, right straight over the top of that.

17:42.438 --> 17:46.822
So you didn't know before the takeoff started where you were going to go.

17:47.643 --> 17:47.763
Right.

17:47.783 --> 17:49.145
And you could operate from then.

17:50.126 --> 17:50.726
Oh, now here we go.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.288
That is a B-24, is it not?

17:52.572 --> 17:58.618
Well, you know, the 24 took a lot of bad feelings during the war, but they were a pretty good ship.

17:58.638 --> 18:02.461
They could do one thing that others couldn't, mass production.

18:02.481 --> 18:02.982
Right.

18:03.002 --> 18:11.690
And you see in Long Beach, California, at Fort Worth, Texas, and at the Willow Run in Detroit, they were turning them out almost every hour.

18:12.010 --> 18:12.250
Wow.

18:12.931 --> 18:20.598
And so really, the thing that this plane could do would be do mass production, and they had a lot of them that went out to all the phases of war.

18:21.299 --> 18:21.499
Right.

18:23.167 --> 18:29.273
And this is the front end of the 24 there at Duxon at the museum.

18:29.533 --> 18:31.275
And they now have a full plane at that time.

18:31.315 --> 18:33.216
They only had a part of the nose pain.

18:33.236 --> 18:43.126
That's got to be a special feeling to stand there and look at that nose section there and put your hand on it and know that it basically formed a part of history.

18:43.146 --> 18:50.052
And one of the interesting things, we had a meeting of the veterans of the 8th Air Force there at Fort Worth and went out to the

18:50.639 --> 19:00.749
to the airstrip out there at Carswell, and there were planes stacked up just like they were and just in the same position they were as when we were flying them out.

19:00.789 --> 19:03.752
That had to raise the hair on the back of your neck a little bit.

19:03.772 --> 19:05.934
That made you think of all the time that it's been.

19:06.054 --> 19:06.615
I can imagine.

19:08.377 --> 19:09.177
What is this picture?

19:09.818 --> 19:19.988
There at Duckford, they have in this museum, air museum, they have on the panels the names of everybody that was lost.

19:20.322 --> 19:21.544
Much like the Vietnam War.

19:21.724 --> 19:25.410
And that's all of the North Sea groups, you might say.

19:25.450 --> 19:30.578
And they have nearly 7,000 that actually had lost their lives on that.

19:30.718 --> 19:33.442
And I believe here in this picture, you're actually finding one of your old comrades.

19:33.462 --> 19:37.308
So I wanted to find a couple of the old ones, and my niece was with me.

19:38.129 --> 19:42.996
And I said, see if you can find Bill Aker.

19:43.757 --> 19:47.443
And she said, yeah, he's there on panel number 26.

19:47.845 --> 19:52.751
And she went through a couple others that I knew that had flown and gone down.

19:53.471 --> 19:55.394
And I said, give me Bob Johnson.

19:55.414 --> 19:58.417
And she said, well, there's a whole batch of Robert Johnsons.

19:59.138 --> 20:01.120
I said, look for Robert H. Johnson.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.842
And she said, yeah, there it is.

20:02.862 --> 20:04.244
Sure enough, it was there.

20:04.264 --> 20:07.788
And he was a real close friend of mine while I was over there.

20:07.808 --> 20:11.152
And he was lost over the North Sea in bad weather.

20:11.172 --> 20:16.738
And so it was kind of interesting to me to see his name up there at that particular time.

20:17.275 --> 20:19.618
What about some of your missions?

20:19.638 --> 20:21.319
You went through, what, 23 missions?

20:21.440 --> 20:25.024
And all missions, every single one is a little bit different.

20:25.064 --> 20:26.826
Some of them are kind of easy, some of them are kind of hard.

20:26.846 --> 20:29.569
But you've had some pretty harrowing type missions.

20:29.589 --> 20:33.313
And you often wonder why they picked a mission as you start.

20:33.873 --> 20:40.701
But really, the two things that they wanted the 8th Air Force to do, they wanted them to cut their supply routes.

20:41.339 --> 20:48.467
to take out their transportation for them, also to take out anything connected with lubricant oil.

20:48.487 --> 20:57.618
And so what they did is concentrate their groups to fight over things that would give the biggest loss of those.

20:57.859 --> 21:04.587
So things like Magdeburg, which is east of Berlin, we bombed that thing into eternity.

21:05.728 --> 21:09.152
And others that you could find that they would pick out

21:09.655 --> 21:12.219
But what they did, of course, was almost paralyzed.

21:13.240 --> 21:22.353
And one of the missions we took, while the Battle of the Bulge was going on, they wanted to try to, again, control the movement of the German troops.

21:22.373 --> 21:25.037
And so they sent us to this town of Aureiler.

21:26.018 --> 21:34.650
And the reason for that was this was a main trail, a rail trunk to get flies over to where the Germans were fighting us.

21:35.322 --> 21:37.224
And it was up against the bank there.

21:37.244 --> 21:42.309
And the idea was that we would drop them and see if we could collapse that bank clear along there.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.574
Or if we missed that, we could knock the rail out and so forth.

21:46.594 --> 21:52.740
Well, I think that they had about every 88 cannon in the German army aimed at us.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.241
I've never seen flack like that.

21:54.962 --> 21:57.965
Every plane in our group was hit.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.428
But fortunately, none of them went down.

22:00.448 --> 22:03.531
But I think that was the heaviest flack that I ever saw while I was there.

22:03.591 --> 22:04.452
But it showed you

22:04.837 --> 22:12.390
how air power could really stop and protect our own troops by that sort of thing.

22:13.291 --> 22:13.532
Right.

22:13.552 --> 22:18.520
Was there any other mission that anything really stands out in your mind?

22:18.540 --> 22:21.926
Oh, there's a whole host of them that kind of come back to you and so forth.

22:22.567 --> 22:30.540
I guess the one that was closest to me was one that happened over Dortmund, which is in the rural area of Germany.

22:30.520 --> 22:36.485
And that was a big area for storage of oil and so forth and so on.

22:37.426 --> 22:43.492
And we started out that morning, they usually would give us a short lunch to start off with.

22:44.253 --> 22:45.474
We might not have anything else.

22:46.154 --> 22:50.879
But I was sitting by a fellow, Joe Shuster, and another fellow by the name of Rob.

22:51.980 --> 22:57.945
And one of them was going to be in the formation that we had there, and I was a little

22:58.516 --> 23:04.704
up front because I thought that I had more positions than he did and consequently I should be flying spark.

23:05.265 --> 23:10.292
Actually what happened was in the formation of the plane, you have the three planes up there and then three below them.

23:11.033 --> 23:13.456
And the one below them we call the slot.

23:13.476 --> 23:18.202
And that's where they took the best flying for the leader of that part of a formation and so forth.

23:18.723 --> 23:22.448
So we got over the drop and so forth.

23:22.850 --> 23:29.200
And all of a sudden, I looked up, and Schuster was on one side, and the other fellow was on the other back behind him.

23:30.341 --> 23:41.879
And Schuster was plowing ahead, and his propeller went right through the wings of the flamed head and scattered it, just shredded the other wing.

23:42.019 --> 23:43.902
And, of course, both of them just quit.

23:43.922 --> 23:49.110
And I remember that there was debris all around, and we pulled up and got out of there to avoid it.

23:49.816 --> 23:59.720
But you could see when they went down, our crew thought that two or three chutes came out, and apparently only a couple mated.

23:59.740 --> 24:03.229
So what you see in the morning then is gone by evening.

24:03.249 --> 24:04.973
And that's one thing about the air end of it.

24:05.358 --> 24:10.124
they're gone, and consequently, they're out of business at that time.

24:10.144 --> 24:11.986
So that was quite a deal for me.

24:12.166 --> 24:18.013
I had wanted to be in Schuster's place, and it was a good thing that I was where I was, or I wouldn't have been on them.

24:18.113 --> 24:21.617
So those things happen all during the war.

24:21.657 --> 24:23.219
We've only got two or three minutes left.

24:23.239 --> 24:24.320
Tell us a little bit about your family.

24:25.161 --> 24:26.243
About your family.

24:26.583 --> 24:32.530
Oh, well, while I was getting my wings there at Aldous Air Base in Oklahoma,

24:33.168 --> 24:37.295
Down the road about 30 miles was a young co-ed that was going to college.

24:38.256 --> 24:40.019
But we didn't meet for eight more years.

24:40.460 --> 24:41.702
Or six more years.

24:43.264 --> 24:48.533
So then we've had three children and we have five grandchildren and one great-grandchildren.

24:49.374 --> 24:54.322
But that was sure funny that you would differentiate and still come back.

24:55.064 --> 24:55.885
I thought of that.

24:56.422 --> 24:58.714
And all your children now, are they here in Texas?

24:58.935 --> 25:00.603
No, they're all up in Kansas.

25:00.623 --> 25:04.322
All our kids wound up in Kansas for some reason.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.023
And they've left Aggieland and are up there.

25:07.043 --> 25:07.764
Nothing wrong with that.

25:07.905 --> 25:08.866
Kansas is a great place.

25:09.146 --> 25:13.352
But it's wonderful to have a family, and I'm sure that a lot of the fellows did.

25:13.372 --> 25:14.053
Absolutely.

25:14.073 --> 25:16.657
Well, we've just got a couple of minutes left.

25:16.697 --> 25:19.861
Any last things you can think of that you'd like to tell the viewers?

25:20.242 --> 25:26.951
No, I think like the other people from GIs on up, we don't consider ourselves heroes.

25:27.892 --> 25:29.094
So many things can happen.

25:29.314 --> 25:31.137
So many things are not planned for.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.604
But they do have a strong feeling for each other.

25:35.545 --> 25:43.174
And in a crew that we had, they definitely had, because they helped me even fly it out of a French field one time when we landed there.

25:43.194 --> 25:46.018
Oh, that's right, when you basically ran out of gas.

25:46.038 --> 25:54.788
But still, I think that was one of the finest things that showed that you could really be in lockstep and you'd be in the same motive and do the same thing.

25:54.848 --> 25:57.732
And that happened to the boys in Iraq and everywhere else.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.992
And we have great feelings for them.

26:01.012 --> 26:03.236
Well, thank you much for being here with us today.

26:03.316 --> 26:04.178
Well, I'm glad to be here.

26:04.218 --> 26:04.779
Thank you.

26:04.919 --> 26:06.001
Thanks for what you do.

26:06.021 --> 26:06.542
No, thank you.

26:06.842 --> 26:07.744
Our pleasure, believe me.

26:09.627 --> 26:14.556
Bill Pope was a part of the 8th Army Air Corps, one of the most storied groups of the war in Europe.

26:15.127 --> 26:19.773
He flew 23 missions and a B-24 bomber into the heart of Germany.

26:19.793 --> 26:25.941
Just too shy of the required 25 missions, they were expected to fly before they could go home.

26:25.961 --> 26:31.808
Then, just like that, the war in Europe was over, and our brave soldiers were coming home.

26:32.489 --> 26:43.463
We salute Bill Pope for his unwavering spirit, his dedication, and duty to country.
