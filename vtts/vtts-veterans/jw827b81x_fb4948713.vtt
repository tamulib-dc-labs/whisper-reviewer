00:01.347 --> 00:20.402
Thank you.

00:28.010 --> 00:29.891
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.911 --> 00:31.489
I'm Tom Turveyville.

00:31.705 --> 00:45.023
Gordon Kennedy had seen a lot of the world during his 31 years of military service, service that included a 15-month tour during Korea during that war, and then a year in Saigon near the end of the Vietnam War.

00:45.503 --> 00:50.250
When he left his final tour of duty in Jamaica, he had hardly even heard of Bryan, Texas.

00:50.810 --> 00:54.355
It was his next duty assignment as an intelligence specialist.

00:54.375 --> 00:58.400
He and his wife of 57 years, Lucille, have been here ever since.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.463
Please welcome Gordon Kennedy.

01:00.443 --> 01:01.827
to Veterans of the Valley.

01:02.288 --> 01:04.654
Gordon, it's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:05.275 --> 01:10.729
You were born in Niagara Falls, so you're a New York guy before you finally made it down here.

01:10.769 --> 01:16.785
Talk about you graduated from high school in 1949, the same year that you entered the service.

01:16.805 --> 01:17.727
Right.

01:18.803 --> 01:22.748
Times were tough in New York in those days, and there was very little employment.

01:22.788 --> 01:25.891
So I had a friend that had been in, was going back in as well.

01:26.372 --> 01:31.258
He and I, he really enlisted and I enlisted.

01:31.278 --> 01:33.460
And from there on, there was the United States Army.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.762
That's right, that's right.

01:34.782 --> 01:42.271
You just made an observation to me about the difference between the World War II veteran and the veteran that you were that came along a little bit later.

01:42.331 --> 01:43.072
Tell us that again.

01:43.192 --> 01:45.655
Well, you know, World War II vets,

01:46.900 --> 01:48.822
drafted or were enlisted to go to war.

01:50.905 --> 01:54.650
My story, veterans of my time, was a little different.

01:55.330 --> 02:02.339
We enlisted just to get a job, most of us, and eventually became a career with me.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.026
So there's quite a difference in reasoning about service.

02:08.146 --> 02:09.087
They were there to fight the war.

02:09.107 --> 02:10.429
You needed to make a living.

02:12.131 --> 02:15.996
And indeed you did for 31 years in the Army.

02:17.056 --> 02:22.622
You actually got a little bit of the influence of World War II after you went to Fort Hood.

02:22.702 --> 02:26.846
One of your first duties was at Tokyo at General MacArthur's headquarters.

02:26.906 --> 02:31.071
So in a way, you sort of caught a little bit of the occupation of World War II.

02:31.091 --> 02:35.375
Yeah, I missed getting the medal by about three or four days.

02:35.415 --> 02:36.977
I was only there 28 days.

02:37.117 --> 02:40.701
You had to be there 30 to get the occupation medal.

02:40.985 --> 02:43.610
Talk about, though, your training.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.353
Where was basic training?

02:45.733 --> 02:46.655
In Fort Dix, New Jersey.

02:46.675 --> 02:50.061
In Fort Dix, and then you went to Fort Hood and then to Tokyo.

02:50.562 --> 02:55.350
Korea broke out in July of 1950, and you found yourself headed that way.

02:55.390 --> 02:58.335
Started talking about getting over there and what your duties were.

02:58.822 --> 03:05.609
Well, we made Incheon Landing in early September, I believe.

03:06.309 --> 03:13.036
And we, the headquarters, stayed around Incheon for about a month.

03:13.817 --> 03:20.203
Then we disembarked onto another troop ship and went around to Wansan.

03:20.223 --> 03:23.786
And set up headquarters there, I can't remember just how long.

03:24.327 --> 03:25.268
It's been a long time.

03:25.328 --> 03:27.630
And then we took a

03:28.302 --> 03:33.490
narrow-gauge railroad to Ung-Nam.

03:34.371 --> 03:37.156
And then we set up our major headquarters there.

03:37.877 --> 03:40.861
And from there you get pretty rough.

03:40.881 --> 03:41.102
Yeah.

03:41.663 --> 03:44.667
They said that it was a secure, it was advertised as secure.

03:44.687 --> 03:45.088
Oh yeah.

03:45.148 --> 03:48.734
It wasn't as secure as they advertised.

03:50.256 --> 03:54.242
As an intelligence specialist, more specific, sort of what was your job?

03:55.640 --> 04:00.705
Well, I didn't become an intelligence specialist until many years later.

04:00.725 --> 04:00.845
Right.

04:00.865 --> 04:13.177
But I was more or less the G2 sergeant the first time I went to a military attache office in the American embassies.

04:13.197 --> 04:14.359
Right.

04:14.379 --> 04:24.769
And like most G2 people, we reviewed documents, wrote reports for the attaches.

04:25.357 --> 04:32.466
I didn't really get involved in the intelligence gathering right off the bat.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.189
Exactly, exactly.

04:34.209 --> 04:35.330
Well, we'll talk about that later.

04:35.350 --> 04:36.432
I want to go back to Korea.

04:37.693 --> 04:44.162
When you had gone on this railroad up to Hung Nam, you talked about that one of your jobs was as a messenger.

04:44.182 --> 04:49.068
Yeah, from the Corps headquarters and the 1st Marine Division.

04:49.429 --> 04:51.111
Of course, they were on the line.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.953
poor devils all the time.

04:55.254 --> 05:07.871
And on one of my trips up there, the Chinese broke through, surrounded the area, and the Marines had to fight their way out.

05:08.692 --> 05:10.034
And I was just tidying it along.

05:11.976 --> 05:18.465
I never fired a rifle, I had it, but I was not an infantryman.

05:20.065 --> 05:22.891
I wasn't very experienced in fighting, quite frankly.

05:23.613 --> 05:25.598
But I knew how to move with them.

05:27.682 --> 05:31.150
They passed through our lines just covered in ice.

05:31.631 --> 05:31.892
Wow.

05:32.233 --> 05:32.934
Frozen.

05:32.954 --> 05:33.395
Terrible.

05:34.578 --> 05:35.560
The Marines were.

05:36.299 --> 05:45.653
I know this time in this particular incident that you talk about, and it's hard, it's emotional, obviously, for anybody in war, as it would be for anybody, but as best you can.

05:46.073 --> 05:47.075
Was it Kotori?

05:47.415 --> 05:48.056
Kotori, yeah.

05:48.076 --> 05:50.740
Kotori, and you found yourself surrounded.

05:51.201 --> 05:51.501
Right.

05:52.402 --> 05:56.248
Well, surrounded in the fact that the whole division

05:56.971 --> 06:00.575
north of the Chosun River, or Chosun Reservoir, I'm sorry.

06:00.595 --> 06:00.916
Right.

06:01.056 --> 06:06.122
Down to there was, that was where we really make the breakout Iskoturi.

06:06.263 --> 06:07.224
Right, right.

06:07.244 --> 06:15.394
And they incurred 12,000 casualties, dead and missing.

06:15.414 --> 06:16.295
Right.

06:16.315 --> 06:20.740
And the 31st Infantry Division, Infantry Battalion was up there also.

06:20.981 --> 06:21.521
Right.

06:21.541 --> 06:24.045
They got very little credit for it, but they were there.

06:24.265 --> 06:25.206
They lost a lot of men.

06:25.827 --> 06:26.910
How did you come to survive?

06:28.454 --> 06:29.056
Who knows?

06:29.076 --> 06:29.477
Who knows?

06:29.757 --> 06:30.118
Who knows.

06:30.219 --> 06:33.848
I tagged along with a group and we walked out.

06:34.530 --> 06:35.372
You were with the right group?

06:35.513 --> 06:36.816
Yeah, with the right group.

06:37.657 --> 06:43.946
Indeed, I know it will move on, but it's part of your service, obviously, and it certainly is.

06:44.106 --> 06:50.736
You got out, they dumped you on some cargo ships, and let's talk about the weather, because about this time, we're talking, what, January, February?

06:50.756 --> 06:54.802
Well, it was December, early December.

06:54.822 --> 06:55.983
And it was just bitterly cold.

06:56.184 --> 07:02.252
Oh, yeah, they put us on that cargo ship, and, you know, they have just these covers they push over the holes.

07:02.272 --> 07:02.753
Right.

07:02.935 --> 07:31.035
and they just half closed it and we were down in there they issued us sea rations for the trip down to busan and we hit heavy weather and the ocean just splashed over the decks right down in on not particularly on me i was out back to the rear but on some of them poor devils they just got soaked to the bone pneumonia i don't i wouldn't believe all of them survived i don't really know right but

07:31.606 --> 07:34.709
Then we disembarked in Pusan.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.572
I think it was two days.

07:37.912 --> 07:42.697
I'm really not clear about that, but I think it was a two-day trip down there.

07:42.717 --> 07:51.667
Well, as was the case in a lot in war, even World War II people will tell you that fighting the elements was sometimes as tough as fighting the enemy, and you certainly saw that.

07:51.687 --> 07:57.833
You went home in January of 1951, and you had, before you ever

07:58.370 --> 08:03.718
actually got out of school, you had met Lucille and you had dated and then you got home and you married her in 1952.

08:03.798 --> 08:04.219
Right.

08:04.239 --> 08:07.063
Tell me about, tell us about Lucille, about your wife.

08:07.103 --> 08:09.266
You all have been married some 57 years.

08:09.286 --> 08:12.871
Oh, she's, she's been a good wife.

08:12.891 --> 08:18.700
I mean, we got, as I say, we got married in 52 and she traveled with me.

08:19.020 --> 08:19.241
Right.

08:19.381 --> 08:22.285
There was only one trip overseas she didn't make.

08:22.855 --> 08:24.197
That was when I was in Vietnam.

08:25.859 --> 08:28.081
But she went to Taiwan with me.

08:28.101 --> 08:29.503
That was a delayed trip.

08:29.583 --> 08:31.045
She come over after I went.

08:31.605 --> 08:33.488
But every place else, we traveled together.

08:34.489 --> 08:38.093
And she fit right in with the embassy community.

08:38.674 --> 08:40.356
She was really a fine host.

08:41.497 --> 08:46.483
And you got to remember, she was a young lady in the early days, you know.

08:47.138 --> 08:50.682
She really conducted herself in an amazing fashion.

08:50.702 --> 08:58.930
And she was ready to follow this guy that she loved all over the world, because she knew that her life would change a lot, right?

08:58.950 --> 09:00.912
You went to Fort Benning to train.

09:02.013 --> 09:06.718
What they were doing was training second lieutenants to actually go back to Korea, but you pretty much had your fill of that.

09:06.978 --> 09:09.941
Yeah, I put 12 weeks in OCS, and I got to think.

09:09.961 --> 09:11.062
I got a little wiser.

09:11.783 --> 09:16.167
They were training, as I said, they were training cannon fodder.

09:16.147 --> 09:21.612
So I resigned and was reassigned right there as a cadre.

09:21.873 --> 09:22.693
Right, right.

09:23.154 --> 09:28.699
And then a piece of paper came across your desk where you saw that there was an opening in Atlanta.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.100
Right.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.944
And this was actually going to be your first of two tours that would be in Atlanta.

09:33.044 --> 09:33.604
Right.

09:33.624 --> 09:35.166
Talk about this first one and what you did there.

09:35.186 --> 09:37.048
Well, I went into supply.

09:37.128 --> 09:38.609
It was a reserve unit.

09:39.390 --> 09:44.415
It was a reserve headquarters that was in charge of all the reserves in Georgia.

09:45.155 --> 09:50.483
We had troops, units that met in the building that we worked in.

09:51.185 --> 09:53.849
And I was more or less their supply advisor.

09:53.869 --> 09:54.991
I did the work for them.

09:56.613 --> 09:59.758
And it lasted about three years.

09:59.778 --> 10:03.484
And as I told you earlier, another piece of paper come across the desk.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.396
We laughed about that a little bit earlier.

10:05.456 --> 10:15.728
You were in these jobs, I guess, clerk-type jobs to where you were at a desk and you sort of found out about these deployments before anybody else did.

10:15.748 --> 10:16.969
So you got a little jump on things.

10:16.989 --> 10:17.290
Right.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.751
They were premium assignments.

10:18.771 --> 10:19.392
Right.

10:19.412 --> 10:23.717
And the next piece of paper that came across your desk talked about a position in Taiwan, right?

10:23.737 --> 10:24.017
Right.

10:24.037 --> 10:27.521
It was military assistance.

10:28.703 --> 10:30.104
And I was signed there.

10:31.306 --> 10:33.488
Again, I was a sergeant major in the

10:33.468 --> 10:34.670
in the G1 office.

10:34.910 --> 10:35.151
Right.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.676
I wasn't a sergeant major by rank, but by position I was.

10:38.876 --> 10:39.678
Right.

10:39.698 --> 10:43.143
And again, we served there for a little over three years.

10:44.886 --> 10:47.850
It was a good assignment, rather mundane, you know.

10:48.051 --> 10:48.331
Yeah.

10:48.351 --> 10:49.253
Nothing exciting.

10:49.453 --> 10:50.274
Right.

10:50.815 --> 10:53.699
I guess it was the first overseas assignment that you took your wife and child.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.461
Yes.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.482
Well, she followed.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.165
That's the assignment she followed.

10:57.185 --> 10:57.746
She followed.

10:58.287 --> 10:59.188
I went over there and

10:59.776 --> 11:03.579
September, and she followed in October or November sometime.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.021
Right, right, with your son Richard.

11:05.221 --> 11:05.802
Right.

11:05.822 --> 11:06.262
At the time.

11:06.642 --> 11:10.326
That was her first boat ride and first time I ever out of the country.

11:10.566 --> 11:10.806
Yeah.

11:10.886 --> 11:13.388
Practically out of the county where she grew up.

11:13.408 --> 11:13.629
Right.

11:13.809 --> 11:14.950
That must have been a change for her.

11:15.010 --> 11:15.731
Yeah, uh-huh.

11:16.852 --> 11:17.552
It certainly was.

11:17.953 --> 11:18.874
Right.

11:19.054 --> 11:28.662
You were sergeant major in the general's office there, and then you went back to the States at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and that sort of led to your next tour in Atlanta.

11:28.723 --> 11:29.243
Is that right?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.115
Well, I never went to Rucker.

11:31.135 --> 11:31.536
That's right.

11:32.076 --> 11:40.406
The general that we had in Taiwan took over the reserve program in the state of Georgia, and I was good friends with his secretary.

11:40.647 --> 11:40.947
I see.

11:41.147 --> 11:44.772
And I told her, I said, when I come back, I'd like a job there.

11:44.792 --> 11:51.540
So I talked to the general while he still was in Taiwan, and he said, well, stop by and we'll see what we can do.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.001
That's all he could promise me.

11:53.021 --> 11:53.642
But it worked out.

11:53.702 --> 11:54.603
I got my job there.

11:54.623 --> 11:56.345
You got the job back in Atlanta.

11:56.366 --> 11:57.367
So you were back there.

11:57.387 --> 11:57.627
Right.

11:57.607 --> 11:58.849
So your tour took you.

11:58.889 --> 12:01.653
But you weren't there long, about another, what, three years or so?

12:01.673 --> 12:02.455
No, I wasn't there.

12:03.096 --> 12:08.004
In fact, the officer I worked for was not very pleased that I wanted to leave.

12:08.024 --> 12:08.965
I'd only been there a year.

12:09.165 --> 12:09.566
Oh, okay.

12:10.047 --> 12:14.714
But I went to, this is when I entered the intelligence service.

12:14.894 --> 12:15.836
Right.

12:15.856 --> 12:17.438
I was sent to Washington.

12:17.979 --> 12:19.041
To the embassy there.

12:19.325 --> 12:21.208
No, I went there for training.

12:21.268 --> 12:22.029
Right, okay.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.694
And then from there I went to Poland.

12:25.034 --> 12:25.315
I see.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.357
The embassy in Poland.

12:26.377 --> 12:26.837
Yeah.

12:26.857 --> 12:30.844
And this is sort of where your globe hopping really sort of started there.

12:31.044 --> 12:33.288
Poland, Hong Kong, Damascus, Finland.

12:33.308 --> 12:33.548
Right.

12:33.749 --> 12:37.335
Sort of take us a little globe hopping with you a little bit.

12:37.475 --> 12:39.819
Well, excuse me.

12:39.839 --> 12:41.822
From Poland, as I said, we did

12:42.140 --> 12:45.044
three years there, that was during the Berlin crisis.

12:46.385 --> 12:56.898
But when we left there, I went back, we went back to the United States, and I did a couple weeks refresher course, and then we went on to Hong Kong.

12:58.340 --> 13:08.012
And same thing, my job primarily, I was copying books, all these books that come out of China, and I was photographing them all, you know, so.

13:08.397 --> 13:17.806
I and my little cubby hole all by myself down in the basement, which was, I couldn't read any of it, but I photographed it all.

13:17.946 --> 13:20.368
And that went on for a long time.

13:20.428 --> 13:25.373
But anyways, from there, you know, it's starting to fade.

13:25.493 --> 13:33.981
From there, we went to... You mentioned Hong Kong and Damascus, and you also mentioned Finland.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.502
Yeah, well, we went to...

13:37.642 --> 13:42.869
Oh, we left Hong Kong on assignment to Washington where they commissioned me as a warrant officer.

13:43.029 --> 13:43.330
Okay.

13:44.591 --> 13:48.497
And then I, from there we moved to Damascus.

13:49.838 --> 13:52.262
And that was during the Seven Day War.

13:52.282 --> 13:52.522
Right.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.104
Well, that's what it mounted to.

13:54.845 --> 13:58.109
We got there in January and got kicked out in July, June or July.

13:59.151 --> 14:00.072
Right.

14:00.187 --> 14:06.153
seeing the tanks roll up to the city limit, the Israeli tanks, dogfighting over the city.

14:07.094 --> 14:09.096
But anyways, we got out of there pretty safely.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.158
Left everything in place.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.022
My wife had a cat.

14:14.082 --> 14:17.325
She left all her furniture, all her groceries.

14:18.146 --> 14:25.013
And she went to Athens before me, and I was evacuated to Rome.

14:25.735 --> 14:30.562
But we finally got together in Athens and went back to the States and I was reassigned to Helsinki.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.825
And what a lush job that was.

14:33.786 --> 14:34.707
Beautiful.

14:34.728 --> 14:35.388
You like Finland.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.430
You like the people there.

14:36.470 --> 14:39.694
You speak very highly, not only the country, but the people.

14:39.775 --> 14:42.959
People were just absolutely fantastic.

14:42.979 --> 14:45.102
So you wouldn't mind being assigned to Finland tomorrow?

14:45.222 --> 14:47.305
I'd go tomorrow, yes.

14:47.909 --> 14:52.313
Eventually you came back from Europe to the United States to near home, to Rochester.

14:52.493 --> 14:56.056
Yeah, I did a job tour there as an investigator.

14:58.739 --> 15:02.362
It wasn't one of our happy times.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.566
My wife lost her parents and I lost mine.

15:08.128 --> 15:12.031
But other than that, it was routine stuff.

15:12.432 --> 15:16.195
Interviews, just interview after interview after interview.

15:16.462 --> 15:19.586
And then you were deployed to Vietnam in January of 74.

15:19.826 --> 15:25.413
We're going to get to that in a moment, but we're going to take a look at some pictures that you supplied us from some of your photo albums.

15:25.433 --> 15:26.534
So we've got a few pictures.

15:26.554 --> 15:31.480
Let's go ahead and go to those, and we'll see the young Gordon Kennedy.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.441
There's you at Lucille.

15:32.561 --> 15:33.422
You know where that was taken?

15:33.462 --> 15:39.370
Yeah, that was taken at the Rencore Ball in Warsaw, Poland.

15:39.390 --> 15:41.672
In Warsaw, Poland.

15:41.692 --> 15:42.233
You look happy.

15:42.253 --> 15:43.054
You're having a good time.

15:43.074 --> 15:43.655
Oh, we did have a good time.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.277
You've been dancing all night, I can tell.

15:45.957 --> 15:46.418
Okay.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.042
There's a couple of young kids.

15:50.845 --> 15:58.495
You know, I don't really... Looks like he was taking one of those border photo booths or something, right?

15:58.515 --> 16:01.278
I don't remember when that was.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.481
Early in our marriage, that's for sure.

16:03.521 --> 16:07.306
That just had youth written all over it, so I thought it was a good one.

16:07.326 --> 16:08.067
Okay, let's move on.

16:08.428 --> 16:09.249
Now, there's your wedding picture.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.110
Wedding picture.

16:10.833 --> 16:11.674
Handsome and beautiful.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.796
My goodness, y'all are both very happy.

16:13.836 --> 16:15.978
So that was in 1952.

16:16.358 --> 16:18.580
I was just 20 years old.

16:20.062 --> 16:20.763
Back from Korea?

16:22.644 --> 16:22.704
No.

16:22.724 --> 16:23.625
You know that picture?

16:23.946 --> 16:25.047
I haven't seen that in long.

16:25.547 --> 16:28.410
That was a picture I had to submit when I applied for a commission.

16:29.251 --> 16:33.675
They dressed you all up in your uniform and took a picture of you.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.877
And that was in your records jacket.

16:36.057 --> 16:37.819
Right.

16:39.655 --> 16:40.556
Squared away soldier.

16:40.636 --> 16:41.076
That's right.

16:41.837 --> 16:44.780
I was in intelligence school there.

16:47.363 --> 16:57.593
We all were going to be assigned to different embassies throughout the country.

16:57.814 --> 16:58.094
Right.

16:58.595 --> 17:01.117
I'm up there in the right hand, second from the right.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.239
Only guy in glasses.

17:03.259 --> 17:05.742
Yeah.

17:05.762 --> 17:06.623
The studious type.

17:06.643 --> 17:07.243
There you go.

17:07.263 --> 17:08.785
This was taken in Vietnam?

17:09.338 --> 17:10.599
Yeah, this was taken.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.143
General Homer Smith was the command general there.

17:14.963 --> 17:16.985
In fact, he is an Aggie.

17:18.347 --> 17:20.749
That was taken on occasion when I was about to leave.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.672
He presented me with a decoration.

17:23.692 --> 17:29.257
I understand he's in San Antonio now, rather ill.

17:29.277 --> 17:31.899
That was taken an hour and hour from Korea.

17:31.919 --> 17:35.683
I think this was in Yokohama.

17:37.199 --> 17:40.160
I don't remember the fellow that's sitting there with me.

17:40.704 --> 17:43.142
We hooked up there and never seen him again.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.903
R&R, doing what you're supposed to.

17:46.923 --> 17:47.844
That's basic training.

17:48.885 --> 17:53.850
The fellow with me there, I know he was from New York, but I don't remember his name.

17:54.971 --> 17:55.592
It's been a while.

17:55.772 --> 17:56.453
Too many years.

17:56.593 --> 17:57.554
It's been a while, Gordon.

17:57.935 --> 18:01.819
You know, if he saw the picture and if he's still with us, he probably wouldn't remember your name either.

18:01.839 --> 18:02.900
Probably not.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.981
Probably not.

18:04.842 --> 18:05.523
Good photographs.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.504
Good photographs for sure.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.467
Vietnam from January of 74 to January of 1975.

18:09.527 --> 18:13.011
Sort of gave us a picture of Vietnam at that time because actually the

18:13.379 --> 18:19.248
the peace accords, the armistice as it were, were actually getting in place already when you got there.

18:19.268 --> 18:24.797
I arrived, there was one company of Marines left, and they were proceeding to leave just momentarily.

18:25.779 --> 18:33.271
And I was one of 50 officers allowed in country at any one time, according to the courts.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.172
And we watched

18:34.709 --> 18:35.370
pretty close.

18:35.450 --> 18:39.176
If an officer coming in on TDY, somebody had to leave.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.785
It wasn't ever me, but somebody had to leave to make room for that extra body.

18:45.427 --> 18:53.680
So we kept telling our superiors, civilian superiors, that they were coming.

18:53.660 --> 18:54.922
Oh, no.

18:54.942 --> 18:55.002
No.

18:55.022 --> 18:55.222
Oh, no.

18:55.243 --> 18:56.104
They're not coming.

18:56.124 --> 18:56.605
We tell them.

18:57.466 --> 18:59.209
I mean, that's what we were there for, you know.

18:59.269 --> 18:59.770
Right.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.351
Intelligence.

19:00.491 --> 19:01.272
They were coming.

19:02.214 --> 19:02.334
Right.

19:02.354 --> 19:02.935
And they came.

19:04.016 --> 19:04.357
Yeah.

19:04.377 --> 19:15.094
Sadly, after I left, I left in January of 75 is when they went out through the roof, the embassy.

19:15.074 --> 19:21.663
Well, just prior to that, they had a big C5A there, evacuating them, the orphan children, 300-some-odd.

19:21.723 --> 19:30.515
And I had three secretaries aboard that aircraft that I'd worked with, and then when it crashed, they were killed.

19:30.535 --> 19:37.505
But then I had a good friend of mine, his wife, when she was Vietnamese, she finally got out, but he had to leave without her.

19:38.546 --> 19:41.190
So it was a hard time with some folks.

19:41.771 --> 19:43.613
I enjoyed my assignment there.

19:44.048 --> 19:51.515
We weren't too bothered by the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese.

19:51.996 --> 19:53.457
They were there.

19:53.678 --> 20:01.285
They'd float a mine down the river and blow it up along some place, but they never attempted to strike us at all.

20:01.305 --> 20:02.086
Indeed.

20:02.106 --> 20:05.169
You were somewhat under protection of the peace accord, right?

20:05.490 --> 20:07.291
Well, we like to think we were, yes.

20:07.391 --> 20:08.993
I know of only one

20:09.462 --> 20:12.988
advisor that was killed, he was a surveyor.

20:13.749 --> 20:16.894
He broke a roadblock and they shot him.

20:18.276 --> 20:19.237
Right.

20:19.257 --> 20:28.011
It must have been a very memorable time and emotional time knowing that you left in January of 75 and just three months later in April of 75 is when the

20:28.345 --> 20:40.403
evacuation is where it took place and the very famous picture that we've all seen of the chopper on top of the roof and the people coming up the ladder to the chopper to actually see that as it was happening and know that that's where you were just three months earlier.

20:40.423 --> 20:41.605
Yeah, I remember the compound.

20:41.665 --> 20:47.433
I remember the flak outside of the flag bearer outside the embassy and all that.

20:47.453 --> 20:47.734
Right.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.758
And they had a

20:52.375 --> 21:20.897
break-in in the embassy just before I arrived that got a couple of secretaries and one of the male killed you know but they killed all the Marines did a good job right better than you would expect them to well they were outnumbered so but they did a good job left Vietnam in January of 75 and your next deployment was Jamaica Jamaica that was a lovely place too sure still is

21:21.198 --> 21:24.301
Yeah, when I was there, it was almost communism.

21:24.481 --> 21:25.262
Right.

21:25.282 --> 21:27.604
And that's the only place in the world we were ever burglarized.

21:27.724 --> 21:29.005
We were burglarized twice.

21:29.025 --> 21:29.306
Right.

21:30.106 --> 21:36.372
But again, we worked pretty close with the Jamaican Armed Forces.

21:36.392 --> 21:36.633
Right.

21:36.693 --> 21:39.375
They didn't have much, but we worked pretty close with them.

21:39.876 --> 21:45.962
In the supply program, you know, we supplied them with various sundry of supply equipment.

21:45.982 --> 21:46.262
Right.

21:46.662 --> 21:49.585
And I was more or less involved in that.

21:50.206 --> 21:55.951
Talk about a trip you took one time with, was it with a Navy officer as an attaché?

21:56.832 --> 22:00.255
Oh, that was in... And you nearly got in trouble.

22:00.275 --> 22:03.779
Yeah, that was in Poland.

22:03.799 --> 22:04.599
Oh, that was in Poland.

22:04.620 --> 22:04.960
Yeah.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.822
We're going to backtrack, but it's a good story.

22:07.022 --> 22:11.286
Yeah, well, we went, it was a naval officer, naval attaché.

22:11.506 --> 22:11.726
Right.

22:12.507 --> 22:17.952
And he was tasked with looking at the naval ports.

22:18.455 --> 22:19.937
and their Navy air stations.

22:21.158 --> 22:23.081
And one time we went to a Navy air station.

22:24.342 --> 22:32.832
I usually stayed with the car on trips, but this time he says, I'm gonna put you out here and I'm going on up the track there, see what I can see up there.

22:32.913 --> 22:37.158
Where he put me out was right at the end of the runway.

22:37.458 --> 22:41.223
I was in a track of trees, so you couldn't see from it.

22:41.243 --> 22:45.728
But as I told you earlier, he had diplomatic passport and all I had was a,

22:45.978 --> 22:47.160
of official passport.

22:47.841 --> 22:51.547
We got caught, he got thrown out, and I went to jail as a spy, you know.

22:52.088 --> 22:55.974
So I had to tell him, I says, Commander, this is the last time I'm gonna do this.

22:56.455 --> 22:57.356
You didn't sign up for that.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.420
And I didn't, yeah, and I didn't do it again.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.381
You had a wife and family.

23:00.401 --> 23:04.247
You didn't need to be going to jail in Poland.

23:04.267 --> 23:04.668
That's right.

23:07.252 --> 23:12.120
After the Jamaica deployment, you had a choice of your next deployment.

23:12.370 --> 23:14.094
Davenport, Iowa or Bryan, Texas?

23:14.154 --> 23:14.475
Right.

23:14.495 --> 23:17.101
And the only thing I knew is Davenport got a lot of snow.

23:17.281 --> 23:18.624
Uh-huh.

23:18.644 --> 23:21.491
And so I chose Bryan.

23:22.453 --> 23:24.377
And there was a young civilian out of shade there.

23:24.397 --> 23:25.620
He says, oh, I was...

23:26.292 --> 23:28.435
in Bryan College Station.

23:28.856 --> 23:30.458
I don't remember if he said he was an Aggie or not.

23:30.498 --> 23:31.379
I don't really remember.

23:31.399 --> 23:32.961
He says, you're not going to like it there.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.063
It's dry.

23:35.184 --> 23:37.528
Well, it wasn't dry when I got here.

23:37.648 --> 23:38.749
He hadn't been here in a while.

23:38.769 --> 23:39.010
Yeah, right.

23:39.030 --> 23:39.991
Well, he said he had.

23:40.011 --> 23:40.632
Yeah.

23:40.652 --> 23:49.124
So anyways, but it was a good thing I really came to Bryan because the next winter, they had great big floods in Davenport.

23:49.264 --> 23:52.428
I mean, downtown was just, you know, like six foot underwater.

23:52.549 --> 23:53.169
Right.

23:53.189 --> 23:55.052
So we made a wise decision.

23:55.252 --> 23:55.793
Right, right.

23:56.397 --> 23:57.379
What was your job in Bryan?

23:57.419 --> 23:59.542
I know you worked downtown in the federal building.

23:59.762 --> 24:00.283
Yeah, yeah.

24:00.303 --> 24:04.390
And again, I was a defense intelligence agent.

24:04.751 --> 24:05.592
That's what they called us.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.854
Right.

24:07.735 --> 24:15.348
And I did a lot of interviews, especially out to A&M, young graduates out there getting commissioned.

24:15.628 --> 24:15.889
Right.

24:15.989 --> 24:19.014
They all needed security clearances.

24:19.314 --> 24:19.515
Right.

24:19.575 --> 24:22.219
My job was to see that they could pass one, you

24:22.537 --> 24:23.739
These are background checks, right?

24:23.840 --> 24:24.240
Right.

24:24.260 --> 24:28.028
For potential officers or even civilians that would need the top clearance.

24:28.128 --> 24:32.637
Yeah, I did, I think I had four or five counties here that I traveled in.

24:32.657 --> 24:32.918
Right.

24:33.659 --> 24:35.763
I had to do Huntsville, the university over there.

24:36.024 --> 24:36.264
Right.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.328
Blinn and Brenham.

24:38.348 --> 24:38.669
Right.

24:38.689 --> 24:39.651
Yeah.

24:39.631 --> 24:41.413
And then the various out in the country.

24:41.553 --> 24:44.716
And I even had to go to the prison one time to do it.

24:44.736 --> 24:44.956
Right.

24:44.976 --> 24:45.997
Doing it in the background.

24:46.417 --> 24:46.677
Uh-huh.

24:47.318 --> 24:48.219
Well, not a background.

24:48.259 --> 24:52.843
I interviewed this fellow that had been named as a reference.

24:52.863 --> 24:53.183
I see.

24:53.343 --> 24:56.066
So I was interviewing him as a reference.

24:56.086 --> 24:56.726
Right.

24:56.746 --> 25:01.090
And eventually, speaking of a prison, you did some work at the Huntsville unit.

25:01.110 --> 25:02.411
Yeah, I worked there for a year.

25:02.431 --> 25:02.731
In Huntsville.

25:02.872 --> 25:03.993
Yeah, I worked there for a year.

25:04.113 --> 25:04.773
At the Walls unit.

25:04.913 --> 25:06.235
I rove back every day.

25:06.435 --> 25:07.316
Right, right.

25:07.736 --> 25:08.997
There was one kind of scary time.

25:09.162 --> 25:20.421
Well, yeah, I was in charge of one of these tanks, and I was talking to an inmate, and he said he was having trouble with his cellmate.

25:20.622 --> 25:21.363
Right.

25:21.383 --> 25:27.614
And I was letting him out for lunch as he was talking to me, and as the line passed, I heard somebody yell, knife!

25:28.956 --> 25:31.440
And I just took a step back, one step back.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.763
He opened my shirt.

25:34.783 --> 25:35.645
But he wasn't after me.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.990
It was his cellmate, and he was after him.

25:38.170 --> 25:38.972
You just got in the way.

25:39.012 --> 25:39.613
Yeah.

25:39.633 --> 25:46.127
And this inmate that was talking to me, he just one poke and knocked him down.

25:46.147 --> 25:46.688
It was all over.

25:48.592 --> 25:49.955
You'd been in tougher situations.

25:50.115 --> 25:50.596
Oh, yeah.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.538
Well...

25:52.025 --> 25:55.550
That job was going to go civilian.

25:55.590 --> 25:56.532
You had hoped for that job.

25:56.592 --> 25:57.413
It didn't work out.

25:57.613 --> 26:03.242
So you stayed in civil service, as it were, and you were at the post office for 10 years.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.003
10 years, right.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.185
At the Bryan Post Office.

26:05.665 --> 26:09.170
And then retired in 1991.

26:10.593 --> 26:13.577
Retired and still living at the...

26:14.131 --> 26:17.580
at the home where you retired.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.347
And you've been very, very involved with the Veterans of Foreign War.

26:20.367 --> 26:22.734
Yeah, for 20 years off and on.

26:23.135 --> 26:24.218
Commander a couple of times?

26:24.358 --> 26:25.541
Commander a couple of times.

26:25.822 --> 26:28.950
They're finance officer, quartermaster.

26:29.335 --> 26:30.176
a good number of years.

26:30.376 --> 26:30.656
Right.

26:31.377 --> 26:39.186
But, you know, as time goes on, you get wore out, you kind of want to kick back a few years, you know, so I retired from that too.

26:39.266 --> 26:40.207
Retired from that too.

26:40.227 --> 26:41.268
Retired, I just faded away.

26:41.448 --> 26:41.709
Right.

26:43.751 --> 26:44.812
Like General MacArthur.

26:44.872 --> 26:46.534
Right.

26:46.554 --> 26:46.674
Right.

26:46.694 --> 26:47.555
Talk about your family.

26:47.715 --> 26:50.138
I know your daughter, Holly, lives in Arlington.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.179
Right.

26:51.219 --> 26:55.844
And your son, Richard, who was in the service and actually was at Desert Storm.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.086
Desert Storm.

26:57.106 --> 26:58.347
Yeah, he retired.

26:58.732 --> 26:59.613
20 years service.

27:00.674 --> 27:04.697
He wanted to be near mom, so he come here and brought his family with him.

27:05.298 --> 27:06.119
He lives here in town.

27:06.219 --> 27:11.383
Works for the First National Bank for 12 years, I think, or something like that.

27:11.523 --> 27:11.824
Right, right.

27:12.124 --> 27:15.667
And between Holly and Richard, you all have, what, four grandkids?

27:16.247 --> 27:18.489
We have four grandkids and two great-grandchildren.

27:18.509 --> 27:19.550
And two great-grandchildren.

27:19.610 --> 27:19.891
Right.

27:20.952 --> 27:22.213
Rounded it out pretty nice.

27:22.513 --> 27:24.795
And I know that you're proud of all of them.

27:24.815 --> 27:27.537
Oh, yes, yes.

27:27.557 --> 27:28.198
I sure am.

27:28.634 --> 27:32.846
31 years in service, if you had to do over again, you'd do exactly that, right?

27:32.866 --> 27:33.448
Yes, I would.

27:35.033 --> 27:36.216
It was good to me.

27:37.139 --> 27:37.841
It was good to me.

27:38.864 --> 27:40.348
I don't regret a minute of it.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.980
We're out of time, but I want to thank you for your service.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.360
Okay, thank you.

27:44.380 --> 27:45.522
And thank you for being with us.

27:45.542 --> 27:46.983
Thank you for having me here.

27:47.003 --> 27:53.972
Gordon Kennedy says that if he could go back to his Army job as an intelligence specialist, he would do it tomorrow.

27:53.992 --> 28:02.582
The career path he chose nearly 60 years ago as a way to make a living indeed became his passion, as has his volunteer service with the VFW.

28:02.602 --> 28:05.005
We salute Gordon Kennedy for his service to our country.

28:05.646 --> 28:06.587
I'm Tom Turberville.

28:06.827 --> 28:09.390
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
