00:00.031 --> 00:07.721
In 1962, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:08.102 --> 00:09.163
First National Bank.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.245
First, always.

00:29.191 --> 00:40.962
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:41.503 --> 00:42.504
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:43.405 --> 00:57.038
We have had the honor to feature veterans who have served in as many as three wars, but today we are honored to meet Albert Novak, Jr., who served his country in uniform for some 33 years in the Navy, in the Army,

00:57.473 --> 00:58.555
and in the Air Force.

00:58.595 --> 01:05.189
That's right, three branches of service as a machinist aboard the USS Wasp for two years during World War II.

01:05.630 --> 01:12.104
Albert Novak recalls the day, March of 1945, when a 500-pound bomb hit the Wasp.

01:12.124 --> 01:17.575
He was one of 150 injured, fortunately not one of the 100 who died that day.

01:17.892 --> 01:22.720
Born and raised in Bryan, Texas, it's our honor to welcome Albert Novak Jr.

01:23.061 --> 01:24.202
to Veterans of the Valley.

01:24.663 --> 01:26.586
Albert, it is an honor to have you here.

01:26.626 --> 01:27.207
It really is.

01:27.227 --> 01:30.673
You served in the Navy and then the Army and then the Air Force.

01:30.693 --> 01:32.156
We're going to talk about that later.

01:32.656 --> 01:34.600
But talk about growing up in Bryan.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.721
You were born and raised here.

01:35.761 --> 01:39.267
You went to Stephen F. Austin and then eventually you enlisted in the Navy.

01:39.327 --> 01:41.571
Sort of talk about the early days here in Bryan.

01:42.007 --> 01:58.443
Well, I started out, I knew most of the people in Bryan because I delivered papers out of Houston papers, Dallas, Waco papers, and delivered to Bryan Eagle.

01:58.583 --> 02:05.810
And then in addition to that, I used to be the Western Union messenger, rode a bicycle, delivered, delivered, and message.

02:05.830 --> 02:10.815
So I knew pretty well most of the people in Bryan because the population was about

02:11.521 --> 02:15.307
6,000 at that time, so I didn't know them personally.

02:15.387 --> 02:18.172
I knew of them or I knew most of them.

02:18.372 --> 02:22.980
Right, because you delivered their paper or their Western Union telegram, so you didn't know.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.095
You were Stephen F. Austin, class of 1942, and then soon after you graduated from high school, you decided to join up.

02:32.295 --> 02:35.200
I went directly into

02:35.180 --> 02:37.563
into the Navy after I got out.

02:37.583 --> 02:41.949
And I went to the Navy on the 8th of September 1942.

02:42.129 --> 02:48.557
And they sent me, I enlisted in Houston.

02:48.577 --> 02:52.562
They sent me to San Diego for boot camp.

02:52.622 --> 02:55.986
And then from there I went on to St.

02:56.067 --> 03:03.516
Paul, Minneapolis, Minnesota to what you call a machinist-made school.

03:03.496 --> 03:12.027
One of the reasons you told me the Navy was attractive to you because you had heard that you got three meals a day, you got a nice place to sleep, and you got to move around a while.

03:13.208 --> 03:20.517
Well, I did get stuck in one place, like I said, and I had a clean bed to sleep in.

03:20.537 --> 03:21.839
I had a hot meal.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.865
Well, except in the combat, otherwise I had a hot meal.

03:28.547 --> 03:30.870
Well, and another thing, my friends,

03:30.985 --> 03:33.769
Most of my friends joined the Navy and they told me about it.

03:34.470 --> 03:37.454
And I was interested in history and geography.

03:37.694 --> 03:38.595
Yes, sir.

03:38.615 --> 03:44.103
And I figured I'd see these places that are studied about, which I did see a lot of them that I studied about.

03:44.343 --> 03:45.585
Right, right.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.569
You attended the University of Minnesota in St.

03:48.649 --> 03:50.732
Paul and talk about those 16 weeks.

03:51.488 --> 04:09.877
Well, in the 16 weeks I became an arc welder, an acetylene welder, a refrigeration mechanic, a diesel mechanic, an automotive mechanic.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.822
What I did is

04:13.308 --> 04:15.271
I found out what they were, actually.

04:15.511 --> 04:15.791
Right.

04:18.595 --> 04:25.404
But I ended up in the heat gang when I went aboard the ship.

04:25.544 --> 04:25.785
Right.

04:25.825 --> 04:28.168
But you learned a little bit of everything in those 16 weeks.

04:28.188 --> 04:29.870
Oh, yeah, in those 16 weeks.

04:30.691 --> 04:32.834
They broke in.

04:32.874 --> 04:35.097
I mean, to give you a little common sense.

04:35.197 --> 04:35.778
Right, right.

04:35.798 --> 04:37.561
And it served you well later on.

04:37.581 --> 04:41.526
You eventually went to Norfolk, Virginia, where you were...

04:41.506 --> 04:44.489
You were in a seaplane flying cargo.

04:44.509 --> 04:45.050
Talk about that.

04:45.110 --> 04:58.004
I went aboard a seaplane tender, but mostly what we did, we hauled cargo all the way from Bermuda down to Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Brazil.

04:59.045 --> 05:07.294
And I stayed on this for six months, and then I transferred to Boston waiting for the ship to be commissioned.

05:07.392 --> 05:08.233
Right, right.

05:08.253 --> 05:14.262
The ship we're talking about, the aircraft carrier, the USS Wasp, CV-18.

05:14.483 --> 05:15.084
Right.

05:15.104 --> 05:22.234
And I've learned so much about the Wasp here just a couple of days here since we first visited.

05:22.274 --> 05:24.538
You can see an awful lot about it on the internet.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.122
They've got a great website about the Wasp.

05:27.142 --> 05:31.468
You were on that carrier for two years, from November of 43 to December of 1945.

05:31.869 --> 05:33.231
Yeah.

05:33.616 --> 05:38.661
Talk about it from the time you left Boston all the way around to Hawaii and then into the Pacific.

05:38.762 --> 05:49.493
Well, when we were commissioned, we went down to Trinidad and all through the Caribbean, what you call the shakedown cruise.

05:49.653 --> 05:50.154
Yes, sir.

05:50.174 --> 05:52.837
That's to get all the nuts and bolts worked out.

05:54.859 --> 05:57.542
If it didn't work, then they repaired it.

05:57.582 --> 06:00.265
So after we went on the shakedown cruise,

06:00.937 --> 06:07.586
We went through the Panama Canal, went through Hawaii, and then we went on all the way.

06:07.606 --> 06:19.863
I went all the way from the Admiralty Islands to Japan, including four boats of which is now Taiwan.

06:20.184 --> 06:20.805
Right.

06:20.825 --> 06:23.128
And I covered the whole Pacific.

06:23.148 --> 06:26.232
Also, I think we did 275,000 miles.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.395
Wow.

06:29.455 --> 06:36.643
In those two years, and those were the two busiest years for the USS Wasp in World War II, when the times that you were on it from 43 to 45.

06:36.904 --> 06:40.488
Eight battles in the Pacific that you were involved in.

06:40.508 --> 06:41.970
Eight battles I participated in.

06:42.270 --> 06:52.542
I don't remember all the names because the islands, some of the like, there was Iwo, well, I was at Iwo Jima.

06:52.562 --> 06:52.802
Right.

06:54.044 --> 06:55.986
I was aboard the ship.

06:56.725 --> 07:00.453
Palau, and I don't know.

07:00.473 --> 07:09.113
Well, as a matter of fact, I'll tell you, because of the miracle of the internet, I do know the eight battles that the WASP was involved in while you were there from 43 to 45.

07:09.995 --> 07:14.886
The Western New Guinea operation, the Marianas operation,

07:15.389 --> 07:26.159
including there, you included the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Palau, like you talked about, the Western Carolina Island Operation, the Leyte Operation.

07:26.179 --> 07:30.223
In the Leyte Gulf, that was the Okinawa attack in October of 44.

07:30.804 --> 07:43.236
Also, the Luzon Operation was what you were involved in, the Iwo Jima Operation, the Okinawa Gunto Operation, and the Japan Operation, eight battles that the WASP was involved in

07:43.739 --> 07:52.335
What do you remember, without being specific to any one battle, but what do you remember about these times in your job and what was involved?

07:52.355 --> 07:54.859
Obviously, the flight deck was pretty busy all of this time.

07:54.879 --> 08:00.870
Well, the flight deck, I was on a damage control crew.

08:00.890 --> 08:04.617
I was below deck, so I didn't see too much of a flight deck.

08:05.103 --> 08:08.987
And I was below deck most, just not all the time.

08:09.148 --> 08:09.328
Right.

08:09.348 --> 08:13.232
Talk about your specific job, because it was quite a necessary job.

08:13.272 --> 08:14.674
You kept the water hot.

08:14.694 --> 08:24.745
Well, like I said, I had a heating system, and I went all the way from the bilge all the way up to the top of the stack.

08:24.845 --> 08:30.992
I had to take care of the whistle and took care of the heating system.

08:31.495 --> 08:42.425
But for the galley, which we call a galley, it's a kitchen actually, where the food was cooked.

08:43.686 --> 08:49.952
And they had to take care of, see that hot water got to the showers, and then they had to heat the ship.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.094
Right.

08:52.194 --> 08:53.195
So that was your job.

08:53.235 --> 08:56.177
So if they had a cold shower, it was your fault, right?

08:56.197 --> 08:57.498
Yeah.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.321
And if they didn't have hot water for cooking,

09:00.385 --> 09:06.753
But I was one of the few people that went from stem, cistern, and from the bottom to the top.

09:06.954 --> 09:11.239
So if the water wasn't hot, they called for machinist second class Novak to see what was going on.

09:11.299 --> 09:11.820
Is that right?

09:12.661 --> 09:14.003
March the 19th, 1945.

09:15.665 --> 09:16.807
What do you remember about that?

09:16.827 --> 09:25.919
Well, I was secured from general quarters.

09:25.939 --> 09:30.004
And every time we secured from vital parts,

09:30.575 --> 09:33.779
The Chowhound, they started running down and down in the mess hall.

09:34.760 --> 09:53.204
So there was a Japanese plane slipped into the landing pattern and he dropped a 500 pound bomb which went through about seven decks and it exploded in the laundry underneath the galley.

09:53.225 --> 09:57.690
That's what killed a hundred men right there and wounded about another 150, 160.

09:57.710 --> 10:00.514
And I was

10:02.215 --> 10:09.863
I was lucky because I was in the passageway and the concussion threw me about 20 feet

10:10.349 --> 10:13.353
into what we call a bulkhead, the wall.

10:14.634 --> 10:19.821
And I was in a coma for about, oh, about four days back in sickbay.

10:19.841 --> 10:23.345
So I didn't know much that went on there.

10:23.445 --> 10:30.714
And when I got out, I smelled human flesh burning.

10:30.935 --> 10:32.877
That's bad.

10:33.017 --> 10:35.961
Yes, sir.

10:35.981 --> 10:36.762
That's...

10:37.163 --> 10:46.134
And it stayed, it lingered, it lingered there for about maybe a month before it finally disintegrated.

10:46.154 --> 10:50.219
It's been more than 60 years, but there are some things that you'll never, ever forget, right?

10:50.239 --> 10:51.681
That's right.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.483
And you were injured.

10:53.504 --> 10:55.706
What were your injuries exactly?

10:55.726 --> 11:00.012
Well, I got a cut and a burn on my back.

11:00.032 --> 11:04.157
And, well, a concussion, I didn't get nothing out of it.

11:04.317 --> 11:05.078
Right, right.

11:05.497 --> 11:09.242
But you earned your Purple Heart because of that on March the 19th, 1945.

11:09.262 --> 11:10.024
Yeah.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.527
And 100 men were killed that day.

11:12.687 --> 11:15.371
It happened around the time that they were lining up for chow, right?

11:15.391 --> 11:16.192
Yeah, yeah.

11:16.212 --> 11:20.939
It was about early in the morning, about 7 in the morning.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.369
One of your shipmates, you had many shipmates, was named Ross Jolly.

11:27.629 --> 11:31.875
And on the website, he wrote a narrative about...

11:32.395 --> 11:34.460
the time on the USS Wasp.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.207
And I wanted to read what he wrote about this.

11:37.688 --> 11:40.054
Many terrifying experiences occurred.

11:40.074 --> 11:47.212
Japanese airplane attacks, the roar and flash of blazing guns, and the black of night made our hearts pound with fear.

11:47.232 --> 11:49.999
We were especially fearful of the kamikaze attacks

11:50.519 --> 11:56.569
The desperate Japanese would dive their explosive-laden planes headlong onto American ships.

11:56.589 --> 12:02.459
Many kamikaze attempts were made on the USS Wasp, but all were shot down in the ocean.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.003
And talk about that day in March of 45.

12:06.445 --> 12:14.198
Seaman Jolly writes, during an enemy attack in March of 45, an armor-piercing delayed action bomb pierced the flight deck amid ships.

12:14.566 --> 12:18.975
It burrowed downward through seven steel decks exploding deep in the ship's innards.

12:19.556 --> 12:26.411
The galley was destroyed and the lives of more than a hundred of our shipmates were taken.

12:26.431 --> 12:29.678
So he writes just as you describe it.

12:29.698 --> 12:32.724
It was certainly a memorable experience.

12:32.744 --> 12:34.368
I never, never, never.

12:34.608 --> 12:35.089
We had it.

12:35.727 --> 12:43.155
That ship had about 2,500 people on it, so you didn't get to know too many of them.

12:43.175 --> 12:47.360
Most of the time, people stayed within their bailiwick.

12:49.022 --> 12:50.063
Right, right.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.505
Your ship was called the Mighty Stinger.

12:52.226 --> 12:57.131
That was the nickname for the carrier, right?

12:57.231 --> 12:59.794
USS Wasp is quite a famous...

12:59.977 --> 13:08.366
And as a matter of fact, later, after your service in World War II had finished, it became an attack carrier.

13:08.386 --> 13:13.652
And as a matter of fact, it became famous also in the space missions, in the Apollo missions.

13:13.672 --> 13:14.192
Yes.

13:14.213 --> 13:23.262
Well, before II, in 1945, we converted into a troop ship.

13:23.843 --> 13:28.028
I made a trip to Italy, and we picked up about 5,000 troops there.

13:28.188 --> 13:28.448
Right.

13:28.613 --> 13:32.618
And after I got off, I think they made two trips to England.

13:32.638 --> 13:41.768
And they lost about 30 feet of the flight deck in the storm.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.610
We'd lost 30 feet once before.

13:43.670 --> 13:51.339
We had to go back to the States, hit a typhoon, and it flattened about 30 feet of the flight deck.

13:51.939 --> 13:55.043
So after it became a...

13:55.428 --> 13:59.235
A troop carrier, it did the same thing when it went to England.

13:59.275 --> 14:02.021
They said about a 90-foot wave hit it.

14:02.161 --> 14:06.309
And imagine when a wave is 90 feet.

14:06.770 --> 14:09.555
They had quad 40 millimeter

14:10.261 --> 14:15.807
machine guns on that it just it just mashed in as though they were paper.

14:16.108 --> 14:17.489
Exactly, exactly.

14:17.950 --> 14:33.447
We have some photographs that that you have in your home that you supplied for us a few photographs and plus some photographs of the wasp that I was able to find on the internet also and I want to go ahead and go to those and we'll take a look at them and you can sort of look at what we are we're going to be looking at here.

14:33.668 --> 14:36.711
This is a picture of a young Albert Novak.

14:36.731 --> 14:38.293
About when was this taken do you believe?

14:39.674 --> 14:41.016
When do you think that picture was taken?

14:41.738 --> 14:42.800
You see it right there on the screen?

14:42.920 --> 14:44.062
When was it taken?

14:44.082 --> 14:45.505
Yeah, about when?

14:45.525 --> 14:49.993
Well, let's see.

14:51.435 --> 14:52.177
About how old were you?

14:52.297 --> 14:53.359
April of 45.

14:53.820 --> 14:54.541
About April of 45.

14:54.561 --> 15:02.155
Yeah, because we pulled into Bremerton, Washington the day that...

15:02.928 --> 15:06.393
I believe it was President Roosevelt that died.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.634
Right.

15:07.654 --> 15:13.021
And so we pulled in, so everybody got leave.

15:13.081 --> 15:16.165
So it was in April of 1945.

15:16.466 --> 15:16.826
Okay.

15:17.387 --> 15:17.968
Let's move on.

15:18.248 --> 15:18.709
There you are.

15:18.769 --> 15:19.950
Where was that picture taken?

15:20.511 --> 15:23.755
That was in the Army in Korea.

15:23.775 --> 15:24.076
I see.

15:24.597 --> 15:24.877
I see.

15:24.897 --> 15:31.045
Because later, when you were in the Army, after the Korean War, you did serve some time there.

15:31.362 --> 15:31.762
Okay.

15:32.944 --> 15:34.785
Let's move on to the next one.

15:39.170 --> 15:39.971
Talk about this picture.

15:39.991 --> 15:44.255
You're the one in the white t-shirt, I believe, the fourth from the front.

15:44.295 --> 15:46.738
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:46.758 --> 15:51.062
Well, see, when they went around me, I had to go through a basic training.

15:51.723 --> 15:53.865
That was Fort Riley, Kansas.

15:54.085 --> 15:58.770
And in the company, everybody was an ex-swabby.

15:59.577 --> 16:06.466
From the commander, company commander on down, there's nothing but ex-sailors in the outfit.

16:09.429 --> 16:10.150
And there you are.

16:11.051 --> 16:12.293
Good-looking young soldier there.

16:12.734 --> 16:23.788
Here's a picture of the CV-18, the USS Wasp, a good color picture of the Wasp at sea so people can get an idea of what this particular carrier looked like.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.133
Got a lot of aircraft on that flight deck.

16:28.450 --> 16:31.959
I think they carried something like 75 ready aircraft.

16:31.979 --> 16:32.360
Yes, sir.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.224
Fighters.

16:34.245 --> 16:38.034
And here's another picture of CB-18 from the front.

16:38.074 --> 16:39.738
You can see with the wings up.

16:41.402 --> 16:44.029
Quite an impressive craft at sea.

16:44.178 --> 16:51.049
Now these machine guns are one that I told you that are flattened out that was on the front of it.

16:51.089 --> 16:52.151
Yes, sir.

16:52.171 --> 16:52.872
There's another shot.

16:52.892 --> 17:01.286
Okay, now this is made later because we didn't have a cannon deck at that time.

17:01.306 --> 17:01.666
I see.

17:02.407 --> 17:06.694
So this is after it had become converted to an attack carrier.

17:06.714 --> 17:06.814
Yeah.

17:07.536 --> 17:09.819
Right.

17:09.839 --> 17:10.180
Okay.

17:10.220 --> 17:10.320
Okay.

17:10.823 --> 17:13.907
Now, this photograph is amazing to me.

17:13.927 --> 17:16.090
I've got some notes on it, as a matter of fact.

17:16.110 --> 17:17.572
You didn't even know about this photograph.

17:17.653 --> 17:21.578
That's the wasp right there in the foreground.

17:21.598 --> 17:39.463
And in that one picture, if you go from the carrier in the front and move backwards, the next carrier is the Yorktown, and behind it is the Hornet, the USS Hancock behind it, the Ticonderoga,

17:39.764 --> 17:44.712
And in the row behind, all the way back, is the USS Lexington.

17:44.732 --> 17:48.257
And this really is the epitome of the U.S.

17:48.457 --> 17:52.443
Navy's offensive power in World War II in one photograph.

17:52.844 --> 17:54.807
Yeah, I've never seen that.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.773
Pretty incredible photograph with all those carriers in one shot.

17:58.793 --> 18:00.536
Yeah.

18:00.556 --> 18:01.177
Okay, I want to move on.

18:01.197 --> 18:03.180
This is a little bit later picture.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.764
You're a little bit older in this one.

18:05.784 --> 18:06.565
Where was this taken?

18:07.186 --> 18:11.496
That's before I went in.

18:11.576 --> 18:15.164
I was in high school when that picture was taken.

18:15.184 --> 18:15.766
Oh, is that right?

18:15.786 --> 18:19.113
I would have thought that was a little bit older picture, but what a smile.

18:19.935 --> 18:20.837
What a smile on your face.

18:20.857 --> 18:24.165
Some of these people, they think I was born old.

18:25.833 --> 18:29.844
They don't remember you when they thought you were born old.

18:29.864 --> 18:35.258
When I talk to some of these people, some of these kids, I say, I wasn't born at this age.

18:35.358 --> 18:37.584
I was your age at one time.

18:37.644 --> 18:38.386
That's right.

18:38.466 --> 18:40.973
I was young and foolish at one time, just like you.

18:42.337 --> 18:42.978
Good looking there.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.943
This is Frances.

18:45.203 --> 18:46.426
Frances Catalina.

18:46.446 --> 18:46.786
Catalina.

18:47.348 --> 18:47.448
Yeah.

18:47.468 --> 18:49.933
And she is your dear friend these days.

18:50.134 --> 18:55.164
And you were married for, I believe, some 65 years to Olita.

18:55.605 --> 18:56.447
And you lost her in 1999.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.571
Yeah, my wife died.

18:58.772 --> 19:01.678
Well, her husband died in 1999.

19:02.232 --> 19:07.661
My wife died in August, and I believe her husband died in June.

19:07.882 --> 19:08.423
Right.

19:08.443 --> 19:17.558
Wanted to include this picture because she's a very, very close friend, and you all mean a lot to each other, and I know, and you all go out and party and listen to music and

19:17.858 --> 19:19.320
And have a good time.

19:19.340 --> 19:24.288
These young kids figure that old folks don't party to.

19:24.468 --> 19:34.743
I mean, lots of them were surprised to see that we were going, Sons of Herman and Caldwell, LaGrange, where they got music.

19:35.224 --> 19:35.565
Right.

19:35.625 --> 19:43.617
And they just can't, they figure once you get old, you get in the rocking chair and you sit there and you wait.

19:43.637 --> 19:44.558
Right, right.

19:45.466 --> 19:59.492
After you finished your Navy duty, you came back home, you worked in various jobs, you worked for a furniture company, you worked for a lumber company for Marion Pugh for a while, but then you decided to

20:00.012 --> 20:01.314
You couldn't find another job.

20:01.334 --> 20:01.995
I couldn't find a job.

20:02.015 --> 20:06.663
You couldn't find work, so you decided to join the Army in 1953, is that right?

20:06.683 --> 20:08.546
I went in the Army in February of 1950.

20:08.566 --> 20:11.651
50, yes, yeah.

20:11.671 --> 20:16.919
And I was stationed in Fort Knox, Kentucky, at Fort Sam.

20:17.760 --> 20:23.910
But I ended up in the Army as a recruiting station.

20:24.363 --> 20:26.206
But I was drafting the people.

20:27.287 --> 20:31.714
I was doing the process and all the paperwork so we could draft them.

20:31.734 --> 20:33.497
And that was in Albuquerque you were doing that, right?

20:33.517 --> 20:34.538
Yeah, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

20:34.639 --> 20:35.079
That's right.

20:35.560 --> 20:39.686
And you were working, that was hard work.

20:39.726 --> 20:41.589
You were working some 18 hours a day.

20:41.609 --> 20:44.734
Yeah, yeah, because I couldn't get any help.

20:44.914 --> 20:47.698
Right, you were driving the bus, you were doing whatever it took.

20:47.979 --> 20:51.484
And then when it came time to get out or re-enlist,

20:52.291 --> 20:57.858
They said that anybody being enlisted who goes to Korea is a rifleman.

20:57.878 --> 20:58.379
On the ground.

20:59.080 --> 21:04.707
Yeah, and I figured at 32, 33 years old, that's two old to start carrying a rifle.

21:04.727 --> 21:10.755
So I got out and I come to Bryan Air Force Base and enlisted as Bryan Air Force Base.

21:10.775 --> 21:11.997
So you were in the Air Force now.

21:12.037 --> 21:12.357
Yeah.

21:12.377 --> 21:17.404
So from the Navy to the Army to the Air Force in 1953, you were at Bryan Air Force Base.

21:17.637 --> 21:21.142
And you eventually did go to Korea as an airman.

21:21.162 --> 21:28.010
I went to Korea, but this was in 1955, so it was all over.

21:28.451 --> 21:31.735
And then there was a span of these tours of some four to four and a half years.

21:31.795 --> 21:34.318
I know you were in Amarillo for a while.

21:34.338 --> 21:36.101
I was in Amarillo.

21:36.121 --> 21:41.788
I was stationed at Texas A&M with the ROTC for four and a half years.

21:41.920 --> 21:42.220
Right.

21:42.260 --> 21:42.961
What did you do there?

21:43.162 --> 21:47.066
You worked here on campus at Texas A&M.

21:47.107 --> 21:49.770
Well, they called the Trigon.

21:49.890 --> 21:50.971
I think it's still there.

21:51.872 --> 21:58.020
And I typed up the paperwork for the commissioning.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.845
For when officers were commissioned out of Texas A&M.

22:01.865 --> 22:03.367
You would do that paperwork.

22:03.607 --> 22:04.628
I did the paperwork.

22:05.369 --> 22:08.033
Eventually to Elmendorf in Alaska.

22:08.073 --> 22:09.314
And you liked Alaska, right?

22:09.354 --> 22:09.835
Yes, yes.

22:10.979 --> 22:22.694
Well, from A&M, I went to Elmenor, if I stayed there four and a half years, come down the Alcan.

22:23.836 --> 22:25.157
We took 16 days.

22:25.177 --> 22:34.369
We had friends that were traveling, so we took about 16 days to get from Anchorage till we crossed the border of the United States.

22:34.730 --> 22:34.990
Right.

22:35.511 --> 22:37.753
And then I went up to Kinslow, Michigan.

22:38.214 --> 22:38.995
I was sweating.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.155
Fargo, North Dakota.

22:42.036 --> 22:44.158
It is cold up there.

22:44.178 --> 22:51.065
But I come to find out, I think it's colder in Kensalow, Michigan, because that wind comes off of Lake Superior.

22:51.726 --> 23:02.877
If you shovel your way out in the morning to go to work, if you come in at noon, you shovel your way in, and when you eat, you're shoveling again.

23:02.917 --> 23:06.180
You're shoveling that same snow all the time.

23:06.481 --> 23:09.325
So you were pushing papers in Kincheloe Air Force Base.

23:09.345 --> 23:10.647
I was pushing papers.

23:10.667 --> 23:11.548
I was in personnel.

23:11.948 --> 23:13.851
You wanted to go back to Alaska to retire.

23:14.131 --> 23:26.648
I wanted to go back to Alaska, but like I say, at that time, my retired pay was $635 a month, and that would have paid the rent, and that's about it.

23:26.909 --> 23:27.930
Right.

23:27.950 --> 23:30.954
And it wasn't easy to find a job up there either.

23:31.735 --> 23:33.197
But for me, if I'm...

23:33.751 --> 23:37.117
When I went to Kensalo, I went to McCarty Air Force Base.

23:37.618 --> 23:40.063
It was in Tacoma, Washington.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.125
Tacoma, Washington.

23:41.466 --> 23:43.389
And that's where I retired.

23:43.470 --> 23:44.772
That's where you were discharged.

23:44.792 --> 23:48.960
Incidentally, Kensalo, they turned that into a state president.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.022
Oh, is that right?

23:50.103 --> 23:52.166
Well, you got out just in time.

23:52.266 --> 23:55.191
That's good.

23:55.491 --> 23:57.474
But you were discharged finally from the Air Force.

23:57.634 --> 24:02.702
Your third discharge after being discharged from the Navy, the Army, and then the Air Force.

24:02.722 --> 24:04.645
And discharged in 1974.

24:05.025 --> 24:08.230
And all in all, from the beginning to the end, 33 years of service.

24:08.497 --> 24:14.825
Well, see, I consider myself retired from the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force.

24:14.865 --> 24:15.345
Correct.

24:15.526 --> 24:17.168
People say, you can't.

24:18.269 --> 24:20.472
But I'm serving all those, I'll figure it out.

24:21.393 --> 24:25.337
And then after I retired, I came back to Bryan.

24:27.180 --> 24:30.904
And first of all, the VA kept asking me this.

24:31.505 --> 24:34.048
Go to school, go to school.

24:34.163 --> 24:34.964
I said, why?

24:35.104 --> 24:38.449
At my age, I was 52 years old.

24:38.469 --> 24:40.271
He said, because we'll give you $450 a month.

24:40.351 --> 24:45.819
So I went to Glenn.

24:46.439 --> 24:48.983
I graduated from Glenn.

24:49.163 --> 24:49.824
Yes, sir.

24:49.844 --> 24:55.391
But while I was going, I was doing maintenance for Albertson.

24:55.552 --> 24:57.494
I did that for about 22 years.

24:57.855 --> 24:58.936
Wow.

24:58.956 --> 25:01.440
It was minor maintenance.

25:02.441 --> 25:03.242
No major...

25:03.830 --> 25:10.056
Plumbing, no major electricity, no air conditioning.

25:10.076 --> 25:14.841
And now, I'd like to say, I had a bypass in 1996.

25:15.242 --> 25:16.363
Yes, sir.

25:16.923 --> 25:19.566
And I started slowing down and slowing down.

25:20.327 --> 25:24.952
And I finally got to the point where when I had to fix something, I had to sit down.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.034
I figured it was time to quit.

25:27.274 --> 25:27.674
Yes, sir.

25:27.975 --> 25:28.335
Yes, sir.

25:28.838 --> 25:30.600
You have a family I know that's very proud of you.

25:30.620 --> 25:34.984
You have three daughters and three grandchildren and one great grandchild, right?

25:35.004 --> 25:35.324
Yes.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.387
And you're very close to them.

25:38.427 --> 25:41.970
I know your three daughters all live here, right?

25:44.552 --> 25:48.856
Albert, you fought in eight battles in World War II.

25:48.896 --> 25:52.500
You were involved in eight battles on the USS Wasp in World War II.

25:52.560 --> 25:57.124
You saw a share of hardship, obviously.

25:57.492 --> 26:00.395
Right now, you're fighting another battle.

26:01.376 --> 26:02.297
Right now.

26:02.897 --> 26:03.558
You have cancer.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.160
Talk about that.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.703
I know you don't have a problem talking about that.

26:09.464 --> 26:10.004
I don't know.

26:10.024 --> 26:11.606
I had a bellyache.

26:13.908 --> 26:21.636
I was going to a doctor, and I asked him who it is.

26:22.797 --> 26:24.158
He said, I don't know.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.545
So baseball season was opening.

26:29.506 --> 26:32.470
The Brian Bomber was opening.

26:32.490 --> 26:35.414
So Francis and I were going to go to the ball camp.

26:36.355 --> 26:39.700
But about a quarter to six, I got a chill.

26:39.880 --> 26:40.661
Yes, sir.

26:40.681 --> 26:42.904
And I'd had pneumonia about four times.

26:43.605 --> 26:47.210
So I thought, well, if you get pneumonia, so I go on emergency.

26:48.151 --> 26:49.713
That's when they found the cancer.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.033
Yes, sir.

26:50.815 --> 26:51.175
Yes, sir.

26:51.779 --> 27:04.818
I mean, they put me in the hospital, and they put me on the... He did a CAT scan, and they said it's pancreatic and liver cancer, which is terminal.

27:04.839 --> 27:07.082
Yes, sir.

27:07.102 --> 27:07.803
But you're not afraid.

27:10.607 --> 27:11.909
You're not afraid.

27:11.929 --> 27:13.051
That's what you told me.

27:13.952 --> 27:15.675
You're... I gotta go.

27:15.695 --> 27:16.997
I gotta go sometime.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.459
Yes, sir.

27:18.479 --> 27:19.260
Yes, sir.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.263
And, like I say, I...

27:23.032 --> 27:26.515
When I was a kid, I never figured I'd get 85.

27:26.535 --> 27:27.436
85.

27:29.598 --> 27:33.722
So I just only had my share.

27:34.122 --> 27:34.482
Yes, sir.

27:35.483 --> 27:37.625
A wonderful and a very proud life.

27:38.006 --> 27:39.887
And we wish you the best.

27:39.968 --> 27:41.969
And we thank you very, very much for your service.

27:41.989 --> 27:46.453
And we know that your family loves you and you're loved by everybody who loves America.

27:46.934 --> 27:50.017
And thank you for defending our country and for serving our country.

27:51.058 --> 27:51.418
Thank you.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.227
We're out of time, but thank you again for your service.

27:55.008 --> 28:02.760
He wore the uniform of a sailor, a soldier, and an airman, and gave his most vital years to the service of his country.

28:02.780 --> 28:07.447
As he endured those eight Pacific War battles more than 60 years ago, Albert Novak Jr.

28:07.527 --> 28:13.396
courageously fights another battle today, and we salute him, and we wish him his victory.

28:13.416 --> 28:14.257
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:14.317 --> 28:17.001
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:55.338 --> 28:59.460
Just look at that camera right there with me, okay.
