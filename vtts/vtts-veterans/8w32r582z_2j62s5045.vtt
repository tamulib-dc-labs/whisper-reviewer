00:09.835 --> 00:34.235
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.255 --> 00:35.337
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:36.363 --> 00:39.589
Certainly, we hear that we're losing our World War II veterans.

00:39.609 --> 00:41.572
A thousand a day, they say.

00:41.592 --> 00:45.139
But there are many who treat their senior years like prime years.

00:45.159 --> 00:46.501
And one of those is R.F.

00:46.541 --> 00:50.789
Sonny Franzi O'Brien, a native of the farm that he grew up on near Curtin.

00:50.829 --> 00:52.873
Today, Sonny Franzi remains active.

00:53.353 --> 00:59.805
Whether it's tending to his extensive collection of barbed wire, guns, or nutcrackers, or just telling the remarkable story.

01:00.241 --> 01:13.884
of leaving the farm and going into the Army, learning to climb telephone poles and set communication wire, and eventually taking that training across the North Atlantic to the front lines of Europe, landing at Normandy on D plus 10.

01:14.646 --> 01:22.679
The bravery that led to five bronze stars and the horror his unit discovered at the concentration camp called Buchenwald.

01:22.699 --> 01:23.641
Sonny Franzi, welcome.

01:24.422 --> 01:25.324
Thank you for being here.

01:25.544 --> 01:25.945
Thank you.

01:26.245 --> 01:31.251
A young kid growing up on the farm near Curtin and all of a sudden they yank you off the farm and they put you in the army.

01:31.272 --> 01:33.194
That had to be quite a culture shock, I would think.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.137
Well, it really was.

01:35.157 --> 01:43.067
I was literally drafted out of the cotton patch in September of 1942.

01:43.087 --> 01:55.543
I never traveled much, but that soon changed with my first trip to Houston for my physical and to be inducted into the

01:55.760 --> 02:19.868
service, then back to Bryan and two weeks later on a bus to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio there to get all of my clothing, all of my GI shoes and clothing and blankets and everything else you need, discard everything that was civilian.

02:19.889 --> 02:25.395
And they immediately tried to make a soldier out of a

02:25.645 --> 02:29.569
out of a plow hand and they didn't have much time to do it.

02:29.589 --> 02:40.659
So they taught us right away how to make our beds, how to roll your socks and all that stuff, which they lasted about a week, I guess.

02:41.459 --> 02:47.325
And then they said, pack all your things in your barracks bag and be out in the street in 10 minutes.

02:48.105 --> 02:48.906
You're ready to leave.

02:49.226 --> 02:55.332
Yeah, your traveling days were just beginning because you weren't in San Antonio very long and you were off to Salt Lake City, right?

02:55.548 --> 02:56.008
Right.

02:56.789 --> 03:08.980
Get out there in the street in 10 minutes, and we sat on our bags for two hours before the buses came and took us to the train station, and our first stop was Salt Lake City.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.589
You didn't know at this time, you still didn't know what your job in the Army was going to be, and when you got to Salt Lake City, you said they dropped you off at a hangar, and you were afraid that you were about to find out what your job was going to be, right?

03:18.910 --> 03:19.450
That's right.

03:19.710 --> 03:24.795
They dropped us off in a hangar with the different parts of the

03:25.163 --> 03:36.118
diagrams of planes shown around and I thought sure I was probably going to be a tail gunner or something but I still had no idea what I was going to be doing in the

03:36.487 --> 04:01.144
in the service and it was off to spokane washington for for real basic training right that was the next uh stop spokane washington and now we started our basic training in earnest and we marched and we marched and we marched and we wasn't marching with peeling potatoes or or uh attending uh shows that uh

04:01.124 --> 04:08.323
showed how discipline was so important and insubordination was certainly not tolerated.

04:10.067 --> 04:17.226
They made us believe that during time of war you could face the firing squad for most anything and that

04:17.324 --> 04:19.147
made a soldier out of you right quick.

04:19.407 --> 04:20.409
I imagine it did.

04:20.429 --> 04:23.093
And then eventually you went to Reno, Nevada.

04:23.273 --> 04:26.578
And I guess it was there that you found out what your Army career was going to be.

04:26.818 --> 04:27.359
Talk about that.

04:27.379 --> 04:28.320
That is correct.

04:29.162 --> 04:36.993
After our basic training in Spokane, we went to Reno, Nevada, just outside of Reno at Lemon Valley.

04:37.834 --> 04:43.703
And there I found out there was going to be in the signal or communications

04:44.273 --> 04:48.099
And I was going to be a pole lineman.

04:48.199 --> 04:52.265
They sent me out with a pair of spurs to learn to climb poles.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.589
Well, I'd always been a climber.

04:54.649 --> 04:55.670
I'd climbed everything.

04:56.452 --> 05:00.137
From little on, mostly the trees to shake out a possum.

05:00.337 --> 05:03.362
The telephone pole was a different thing.

05:04.564 --> 05:12.576
This was different, especially with the old dull spurs they gave us, but I managed to

05:12.944 --> 05:14.888
be able to climb pretty good.

05:15.749 --> 05:21.840
And of course, seeing Reno was really something to this old country boy, you know.

05:24.084 --> 05:30.095
With all the silver dollars lined up on the tables, that was really something.

05:30.596 --> 05:36.066
And to go to a bar and the fellas with me ordered a

05:36.670 --> 05:59.404
highball i didn't know what that was but i said i'll have one of those i thought that was the best tasting whiskey better than that bootleg stuff and uh of course uh we continued our our training there was a little little humor with it too

06:00.025 --> 06:08.715
One morning we was in formation, and just before we were dismissed, the sergeant said, need some volunteers.

06:10.236 --> 06:19.687
So I volunteered, which you're not supposed to do in the Army, but I, along with half a dozen or so, was volunteered.

06:19.807 --> 06:23.211
And he said, all the rest of it can go back to your bunks.

06:24.212 --> 06:28.497
And those volunteers can go out in the sagebrush there and chase jackrabbits.

06:30.569 --> 06:32.331
There was plenty of rabbits around.

06:32.352 --> 06:35.736
We saw one, but we didn't chase them very far.

06:36.197 --> 06:38.600
That was the end of your volunteer days, right?

06:38.620 --> 06:38.741
Right.

06:38.901 --> 06:40.443
You learned to keep your mouth shut then.

06:40.463 --> 06:52.620
Well, from Reno then, we went to traveling again to Fresno, California, which was supposed to be our battalion headquarters.

06:52.640 --> 06:52.760
Right.

06:52.780 --> 06:59.530
But communications consisted of so many different things.

07:00.033 --> 07:05.543
pole linemen or whether it was cable or cable splicing or field war or whatever.

07:06.124 --> 07:12.936
So we splintered our outfit and sent us off in different directions with training.

07:12.956 --> 07:20.810
And mine was to go all the way back to Everett, Washington and learn pole line construction.

07:20.831 --> 07:24.437
You told me one time during this training that there was an incident that

07:25.160 --> 07:26.762
Your career in life almost ended.

07:26.822 --> 07:27.583
It was a little scary.

07:27.643 --> 07:28.544
Well, that's true.

07:28.824 --> 07:34.330
I was working on this telephone line.

07:34.370 --> 07:44.982
These poles had the power line at the top of the pole, and below were telephone cross arms.

07:45.002 --> 07:53.732
And I was up on the pole guiding the wire across the cross arm that the truck was pulling a wire across.

07:54.640 --> 08:06.138
when the wire broke and the end of it flew up over the power line and came right back down and got against my metal on my spur, my shank of the spur.

08:07.079 --> 08:19.078
And the sparks were flying out of that and I thought, sure, I was going to get electrocuted, but this foreman on the civilian foreman, he said, just stay calm and reach down with your glove and

08:19.447 --> 08:22.730
take that wire off you and spark, which I did.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.914
And strangely, I never felt a shock of any kind.

08:25.934 --> 08:26.534
Very fortunate.

08:26.835 --> 08:27.575
Yeah.

08:27.595 --> 08:28.677
Eventually to Seattle.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.039
And finally, you got off the West Coast.

08:31.059 --> 08:38.907
And you moved closer to where you were going because you went cross country to Newport News, Virginia to get ready to go to Europe.

08:38.947 --> 08:40.409
Let's go ahead and fast forward there.

08:40.469 --> 08:41.890
You're at Newport News.

08:42.191 --> 08:46.315
And eventually, you're on the boat across the North Atlantic and that

08:46.565 --> 08:48.749
you recall is a pretty miserable trip.

08:48.809 --> 08:49.791
Oh, that was terrible.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.298
We were on a ship named Santa Paula.

08:54.318 --> 08:58.986
It was a converted small ocean liner.

08:59.006 --> 09:07.882
And we had 3,200 personnel on board, but only 1,600 bunks.

09:07.902 --> 09:11.087
So we were supposed to have a bed every other night.

09:12.265 --> 09:15.933
And we sailed up the coast to St.

09:15.953 --> 09:19.280
John's Harbor in Newfoundland.

09:19.300 --> 09:30.122
And there we anchored for 24 hours because there was a pack of submarines, German subs, reported off the coast.

09:30.946 --> 09:45.928
and finally got our convoy together, which consisted of two transport, troop transports, two tankers, and we were escorted by two destroyers.

09:47.891 --> 09:54.982
We started out and the sea immediately got so rough in the North Atlantic, it was terrible.

09:55.022 --> 09:57.966
It got into a storm and the waves were

09:58.486 --> 10:09.163
50 feet high, I guess, and the guy that I was supposed to bunk with got so seasick he couldn't get out of bed.

10:09.184 --> 10:14.993
So I just took my blankets and went out on the deck where I

10:14.973 --> 10:25.676
I stayed in this miserable weather, and I never did get sick, but I sure was cold.

10:25.716 --> 10:29.404
That was a long two weeks, but eventually you landed in Liverpool.

10:29.823 --> 10:35.088
And going to England, that was a little bit of a culture shock to the farm boy, too, landing in England, right?

10:35.108 --> 10:35.809
It was, too.

10:36.990 --> 10:41.514
I thought the British spoke English, but I couldn't.

10:41.534 --> 10:42.976
It wasn't South Texas English.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.118
I could hardly understand them.

10:45.698 --> 10:58.851
And then, of course, we got paid with their English money, which was a farthing and a half penny and a penny and a shilling, which they called a bob.

10:59.489 --> 11:02.954
And we had to get used to all that.

11:04.777 --> 11:09.523
You're getting ready in the spring of 1944 is where we are now.

11:10.244 --> 11:18.736
You were sent to an RAF base where you said that you learned a little bit about doing without food.

11:18.756 --> 11:25.446
Yeah, we were just a small group of us were in training and sent to a

11:26.118 --> 11:27.884
to stay on RAF base.

11:28.386 --> 11:33.585
And there, of course, we had to eat with the British soldiers on their base.

11:34.689 --> 11:38.001
And they didn't have much food.

11:38.487 --> 11:51.599
They had a lot of potatoes, which they fixed for one meal, maybe three different kinds, three different ways, with some mutton that tasted terrible.

11:51.619 --> 11:54.141
But you had to eat it because it's all you had.

11:55.062 --> 12:01.708
And the British didn't have any money, the British soldiers.

12:02.369 --> 12:04.411
And we always had some.

12:04.431 --> 12:07.093
We could buy a little extra stuff

12:07.343 --> 12:20.596
We needed like what would go to the village and go to the fish and chips joint, which is fish and fried potatoes like our hamburgers were.

12:21.077 --> 12:30.566
You move on to South Hampton and you get your first experience with an air raid at South Hampton before you've even crossed over the English Channel.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.267
Talk about that.

12:31.327 --> 12:31.847
That's right.

12:31.887 --> 12:34.650
We were in a staging area at South Hampton.

12:35.137 --> 12:41.728
where everyone was getting ready to go across the channel to France for the invasion.

12:41.768 --> 12:46.356
Of course, we didn't know where we were going or when.

12:46.376 --> 12:54.630
So one night, about midnight, I had an air raid there.

12:55.133 --> 13:01.063
Bombers were falling so thick that the barracks were kind of jumping up and down.

13:01.123 --> 13:03.387
Mess kits were falling off the walls and all.

13:03.407 --> 13:10.359
And the officer stuck his head in the barracks and said, grab your helmets and hit the woods.

13:10.379 --> 13:12.443
So we didn't have to be told twice.

13:12.483 --> 13:15.929
We went out and I laid down by a log I found.

13:16.851 --> 13:19.335
And I looked up the old...

13:19.602 --> 13:24.614
The camp was just lit as bright as day from the German flares that they had dropped in.

13:24.634 --> 13:34.438
The bombs were falling and the searchlights were showing on all the German planes going over.

13:34.705 --> 13:40.214
And finally I heard a loud plop close to me, I guess about 25 yards away or something.

13:41.316 --> 13:54.857
And we had heard talk about the forced labor from the inmate camps were sabotaging some of the munitions.

13:55.276 --> 13:56.477
This happened to be a dud.

13:56.898 --> 13:59.160
So that one got sabotaged and that was good for you.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.002
Yeah, it was a dud and it didn't explode.

14:02.263 --> 14:04.144
BE Day is June the 6th, 1944.

14:04.204 --> 14:11.591
Ten days later on the 16th is the day that your unit moves out across the English Channel and you land at Normandy.

14:11.772 --> 14:12.773
D-Day plus 10.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.795
Talk a little bit about landing at Omaha Beach.

14:16.216 --> 14:17.237
Well, that's right.

14:17.257 --> 14:24.844
We were on a landing craft that was shuttling back and forth as fast as they

14:25.752 --> 14:34.039
could, taking troops across and then bringing the dead ones back from Normandy Beach.

14:34.059 --> 14:37.822
And I noticed a pile of blooded blankets over on one side.

14:37.862 --> 14:41.766
And I thought, this looks like it might get a little serious here.

14:42.587 --> 14:54.797
So we finally dropped the tailgate on this landing craft and drove our vehicles off into about three foot of water out on the beach.

14:55.199 --> 14:58.664
You spent the first night at a briar patch, I think you said.

14:59.405 --> 14:59.746
Yeah.

14:59.766 --> 15:03.091
But they're still shelling the beach, the harbor there.

15:03.131 --> 15:04.473
They were shelling.

15:04.513 --> 15:05.855
Even 10 days after D-Day.

15:05.935 --> 15:06.216
Right.

15:06.556 --> 15:12.606
But you and your job and your unit, you're working your way through the area, through northern France.

15:14.228 --> 15:15.270
Talk about what you were doing.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.675
You were climbing telephone poles and setting up communication.

15:18.695 --> 15:22.000
At that time, we didn't have time to...

15:22.317 --> 15:32.112
climb any poles or do any construction, it was mainly getting the wiring to the front because the front was moving so fast.

15:32.132 --> 15:47.295
And at one point, some of our unit, well it wasn't our unit, but the Army had been pinned down and they called in

15:47.900 --> 15:53.154
our support and we was right at the edge of this.

15:53.174 --> 15:58.990
I could look down and see the planes coming in and they had the wrong

15:59.577 --> 16:25.197
uh directions that bombed our troops and that's was pretty has been pretty well publicized to all the people that were killed there and friend to fire communications to the front lines though this is your your your main job and you get into the winter of 1944 and it becomes an even harder job because you're you're trying to negotiate polls in in the dead of winter through a lot of snow and a lot of ice that's a little different than your training right

16:25.615 --> 16:42.409
Well, that's true, but before that we put communications all through the hedgerows and everything and then made a mad dash to Paris to follow Patton.

16:42.389 --> 16:51.904
when he broke through and of course they needed communications along the front as soon as fast as it moved.

16:51.924 --> 17:06.507
And we got to Paris with good reception with people all along the route cheering us on because we were among the first ones to get to Paris.

17:06.487 --> 17:13.932
And there we bivouacked just outside of Paris and one man came

17:14.620 --> 17:26.375
to the camp and ask Buddy and I to come to his house to take a bath because we hadn't had one in a couple of months, I guess.

17:27.237 --> 17:30.200
So the way we could wash it was just a little cold water and a helmet.

17:31.102 --> 17:43.598
And so we went with him and he could, the trouble was he could speak only French and Spanish and I could speak only English and German.

17:43.915 --> 17:48.860
But we got along real well, and he gave us some breakfast and all.

17:48.880 --> 17:57.150
We need to move along a little bit, but I know that the Battle of the Bulge was one of the Bronze Stars that you won was for your involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, so you were involved there.

17:57.930 --> 18:08.082
I want to come back and talk about that, but let's move along to after VE Day, the war is over in Europe, and you and your unit come across the concentration camp at Buchenwald.

18:08.102 --> 18:10.925
This is obviously something and experience that you will never forget.

18:11.445 --> 18:13.888
And talk about that a little bit, and then we're going to show some photographs.

18:14.273 --> 18:15.474
All right.

18:16.635 --> 18:26.664
After the war was practically over, they sent us to Far East Germany at Weimar.

18:27.945 --> 18:34.071
And as we approached the area, we saw the smoke rising.

18:34.331 --> 18:36.913
Of course, didn't know exactly what it was at that time.

18:37.353 --> 18:43.639
But we got settled in, and in a couple of days, we went up to the

18:44.159 --> 18:48.943
to this camp proved to be Buchenwald concentration camp.

18:50.024 --> 19:01.875
And there we, as we went up to the camp along this tree-lined lane, there were bodies all along the way.

19:02.716 --> 19:11.584
And people that had, when the Germans evacuated the place, all the inmates that were there tried to run

19:12.172 --> 19:15.758
And a lot of them were so weak, they didn't make it.

19:15.778 --> 19:16.860
They died on the way.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.866
I want to make sure I get to these photographs.

19:20.886 --> 19:23.150
And you've got some incredible photographs.

19:23.170 --> 19:27.337
We're going to go all the way back to D-10 when you all landed at Normandy.

19:27.357 --> 19:29.761
And if you can see over there on that monitor, there's a photograph.

19:29.781 --> 19:35.089
That's a vehicle, I guess, similar to the one that you landed at Omaha Beach.

19:35.129 --> 19:35.530
Is that right?

19:35.645 --> 19:38.529
Yes, of course, we had a line truck.

19:39.110 --> 19:47.202
It was similar to some of these, but that's the way we drove off into the water and got out on the beach.

19:48.123 --> 19:51.748
So this photograph is taken of the typical landing that you were involved in.

19:51.929 --> 19:52.309
Right.

19:58.438 --> 20:03.846
Talk a little bit more about the Battle of the Bulge

20:04.180 --> 20:09.588
And your involvement in that, you were more on the eastern part of France, is that right?

20:09.608 --> 20:26.852
We had worked our way into Belgium and all the way to Malmedy and had done a lot of communication work around that, telephone poles and all that stuff.

20:26.973 --> 20:30.137
When all of a sudden we had to

20:30.725 --> 20:39.337
get on our trucks and run like the Dickens because the Germans had launched this Battle of the Bulge with all the tanks that were coming.

20:39.397 --> 20:43.583
We had to try to outrun them, which we did, all the way back to Charleroi.

20:44.585 --> 20:59.466
And there we went to work immediately to put a communications across the Meuse River because the tanks were getting close to the river and if they had, they'd cut all of our communications.

21:00.222 --> 21:03.946
And it was the Christmas of 1943.

21:04.406 --> 21:12.114
And it's supposed to have been the coldest winter in the century, and I guess it was below zero.

21:12.454 --> 21:13.495
The weather wasn't very good.

21:13.515 --> 21:15.737
Matter of fact, we're going to go to a photograph now.

21:16.098 --> 21:18.000
This is soon after you landed at Normandy.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.401
You're not in this picture.

21:19.421 --> 21:26.348
This is a picture of a couple of your buddies, but that's sort of an example of how you lived there after the landing at Normandy.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.612
That's typical of our tents.

21:29.632 --> 21:30.833
We called it a shelter half.

21:30.933 --> 21:34.057
Each one was issued half of a shelter.

21:34.097 --> 21:49.774
We had to put it together and usually dug a foxhole and then put this shelter over it and it seemed like it rained every day there and the water ran in on our blankets and got it all wet.

21:49.794 --> 21:51.195
It was miserable.

21:52.837 --> 21:53.618
Some people

21:53.935 --> 21:59.100
learn how to smile, even though with that, because that was the job that you had to do.

22:00.182 --> 22:05.287
Going through Germany, you saw a lot of horror of the war, a lot of the remnants of the war, I know.

22:05.927 --> 22:16.138
And in a few seconds, we're going to go to one of the photographs that you had of the bombed out part of Germany that I want you to talk about.

22:16.158 --> 22:17.139
And there it is right there.

22:17.860 --> 22:19.502
Talk about that picture and what we're looking at.

22:19.522 --> 22:23.706
Well, this is us trying to repair

22:24.108 --> 22:37.126
a rail line, but most of the villages and towns were completely destroyed and hardly knew where we were because we were all alike.

22:37.767 --> 22:44.716
They were all destroyed and so bad that we had to bulldoze out the streets to even get through.

22:46.558 --> 22:49.963
This is the only one example.

22:50.112 --> 22:55.558
Right, you have several pictures like this and that's one of the pictures.

22:56.819 --> 23:05.548
There was a story about an airplane, I believe it was a German airplane, it was actually a jet airplane and y'all weren't really familiar with planes without propellers.

23:05.568 --> 23:16.339
And talk a little bit, there was one that had crashed and we're gonna have a picture coming up of it here in just a little bit and this was quite remarkable to the American soldier looking at this plane without propellers.

23:16.403 --> 23:23.391
Well, of course, this was when we were in East Germany already and the war was about over.

23:24.472 --> 23:32.962
And this plane landed and a crash landed in the pasture close to us.

23:32.982 --> 23:37.187
And we all went to see it because it was a plane without propellers.

23:37.267 --> 23:38.709
And we couldn't understand that.

23:38.769 --> 23:40.611
We'd never seen a jet plane.

23:40.631 --> 23:43.795
See the soldier there on the right side taking a picture of this.

23:44.686 --> 23:55.720
And supposedly this German pilot had crash-landed this plane that had to keep from being captured by the Russians.

23:56.861 --> 23:59.104
And supposedly it brought his family with him.

23:59.124 --> 24:07.875
Of course, I didn't see the occupants of the plane, but this was the plane, the first jet plane.

24:08.598 --> 24:13.390
Sonny, Buchenwald is still something that's obviously stamped in your memory.

24:13.872 --> 24:19.366
I guess before you got there, you did not realize the type of inhumanity that was involved in World War II.

24:19.747 --> 24:22.534
But this is something that you saw firsthand.

24:22.554 --> 24:24.058
It's something that I know that you'll never forget.

24:24.747 --> 24:25.668
Well, that's right.

24:25.768 --> 24:38.499
I was actually, I think, the first person into the camp because I was a sergeant that led the group into the camp when we got there and no one else had been there.

24:38.519 --> 24:44.004
And I have some of the pictures here that we saw.

24:44.425 --> 24:54.754
And there was one person left in there that could speak very well and showed,

24:54.734 --> 25:03.124
me around the camp and told us what had transpired in the camp.

25:04.201 --> 25:13.432
Some of those photographs that I've seen, I've chosen not to show them on this particular program because they are quite graphic, but I know that people have probably seen histories of World War II.

25:13.832 --> 25:20.640
I do want to show a couple of things that you brought back from Buchenwald, and I want you to talk about them as I'm holding them here.

25:21.401 --> 25:24.524
Talk about, obviously, the swastika button.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.627
Talk about the history of that and how you came by that.

25:26.707 --> 25:31.272
Well, I just found that in the barracks next to the concentration camp.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.399
I just picked that up.

25:33.459 --> 25:35.163
It doesn't signify anything, really.

25:35.463 --> 25:38.349
Is it a collar ornament of some sort?

25:38.549 --> 25:40.753
I think that's what it was, yeah.

25:40.773 --> 25:44.240
And the wings, I think you can see at the bottom of the wings, the swastika on that.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.484
This is made out of tin or aluminum.

25:46.725 --> 25:48.228
German pilot.

25:48.248 --> 25:49.530
But as to these pictures,

25:49.966 --> 25:56.175
I've shown them to a lot of the schools and everything, so I don't imagine there'd be anything wrong with showing them now.

25:56.195 --> 25:56.535
Right.

25:56.555 --> 26:08.311
Well, we're sort of pressed for time, but there is one thing that I wanted to show here, and I'm going to hold it up here to the cameras, and we will get a shot of it here when we get focused on it.

26:08.632 --> 26:14.119
And what this is, this is a meal token that was actually given to you by an inmate of Buchenwald.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.644
This is an incredible artifact of World War II.

26:17.624 --> 26:20.869
Talk a little bit about how you came about this and exactly what this is.

26:20.909 --> 26:33.189
Well, he gave me this, and that was his meal token, which was given to the inmates for our day's work.

26:33.971 --> 26:41.623
And then titled them to a little bowl of soup and probably a few potatoes peelings, which they fought over.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.854
But they literally all starved to death.

26:45.695 --> 26:47.498
Indeed.

26:47.798 --> 26:49.340
This is an artifact.

26:49.861 --> 26:54.468
There's not many of those around, and you have one of them.

26:54.548 --> 27:02.360
After the war was over, at the time, you had orders to go and be involved in a ground war in Japan.

27:02.901 --> 27:04.303
But fortunately, you didn't have to do that.

27:04.705 --> 27:21.708
Well, of course, we had the, after the war was over, there was this numbers that accumulated, you know, where you were supposed to be able to go home, be discharged.

27:22.389 --> 27:33.945
But I was declared essential or whatever you call it and was given a command to go direct to Japan.

27:33.965 --> 27:34.105
Mm-hmm.

27:34.439 --> 27:51.600
when the war was over, so we left Germany and into France with those instructions and got on a train, a French train, and went to Marseille, France to get on the boat to go direct to the Pacific.

27:52.001 --> 27:52.842
Sonny, we're out of time.

27:52.922 --> 27:56.927
I'm sorry, it just goes too quickly, and I apologize for that, but thank you very much for your service.

27:57.788 --> 27:59.290
Sonny Franzi, thank you very much.

27:59.390 --> 27:59.991
Thank you, Tom.

28:00.011 --> 28:04.176
Just far, boy, from a round curtain, Sonny Franzi saw a slice of life and death

28:04.544 --> 28:08.730
that a few of us of a later generations would ever experience.

28:09.211 --> 28:12.436
An American soldier fighting on the native soil of his ancestors.

28:12.456 --> 28:19.386
He's certainly proud of his German heritage and equally proud to have fought and to live in a country that allows him to be.

28:19.887 --> 28:21.549
We salute Sergeant R.F.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.552
Sonny Franzi and all veterans.

28:23.572 --> 28:25.915
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

28:25.935 --> 28:26.897
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:26.917 --> 28:29.100
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:37.585 --> 28:44.490
Thank you.
