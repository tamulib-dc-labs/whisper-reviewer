Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.213 --> 00:33.194
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.955 --> 00:46.553
Chuck Sippial has been a significant part of Texas A&M's administrative family for some 15 years as vice president for administration, more recently in charge of facilities where he now works for the A&M system.

00:47.154 --> 00:53.363
The story you may not know is that of Colonel Chuck Sippial, United States Air Force officer for 22 years.

00:53.903 --> 01:00.092
It was a fascinating career that included a nine-month tour at Pleiku Air Base during the Vietnam War.

01:00.072 --> 01:06.503
Also, two tours in Europe, first at Madrid, Spain, and then later at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

01:07.104 --> 01:16.521
He served several stateside tours where his expertise and education as a civil engineer paved a path to both his military and civilian careers.

01:17.142 --> 01:20.067
Colonel Charles A. Chuck Sippial Sr.

01:20.287 --> 01:22.992
is our guest today on Veterans of the Valley.

01:22.972 --> 01:25.938
Chuck, it's an honor to have you, an honor to finally have you here.

01:25.958 --> 01:27.741
I've wanted to have you on the show for a long time.

01:28.402 --> 01:31.368
Let's go back to when you were born in Montgomery, Alabama in 1944.

01:31.648 --> 01:38.581
You and your family, your siblings, 11 of you, and mom and dad, you lived a little bit outside of Montgomery on a farm.

01:38.842 --> 01:43.410
You grew food and sort of talk about growing up at that time in Montgomery, Alabama.

01:43.998 --> 01:46.044
Well, thank you very much for having me here, Tom.

01:46.124 --> 01:48.491
I've been waiting, too, to come on the show.

01:48.551 --> 01:51.760
I think it's a very – it's an excellent show.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.485
Thank you.

01:53.633 --> 01:56.298
I grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, as you just stated.

01:56.338 --> 02:01.689
We lived out in what we referred to as the country back in those days, seven miles out of the city.

02:02.931 --> 02:11.447
We had an 18-acre farm that we grew vegetables and corn and all kinds of things for the family to exist on.

02:11.548 --> 02:15.355
We also had cows and pigs.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.279
And we had a horse that we used to work the farm.

02:18.300 --> 02:25.270
And when we were old enough to go out and work in the garden, that's what we would be assigned to do.

02:25.290 --> 02:32.401
We were old enough to feed the chickens in the morning and the hogs in the evening when we came from school.

02:32.441 --> 02:33.322
That's what we did.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.706
And we did that until age 11.

02:36.023 --> 02:42.398
And at age 11, Dad then would take us out with him to learn how to become electricians.

02:42.639 --> 02:54.167
We were kind of the guys who did all the hard work, all the dirty work, crawling underneath houses, in the attics, and stringing wires and stuff.

02:54.147 --> 03:06.142
continued until we were age 16 and were old enough to get our driver's license and then he started developing us to be crew leaders working for him and having a crew of two or three and wiring houses.

03:06.162 --> 03:18.518
We wired thousands and thousands of houses over our careers working for dad and we worked for dad until we were able to go to college but dad was pretty smart.

03:18.498 --> 03:25.972
because he sent us to college either in Montgomery or in Tuskegee, which is 30 minutes away.

03:25.992 --> 03:30.700
So in either case, when we were not in class, we were working with the business.

03:31.862 --> 03:37.413
Dad was a very successful contractor in that he was able to send all 11 of us to college.

03:37.433 --> 03:38.575
Wow.

03:39.717 --> 03:39.797
Wow.

03:39.777 --> 03:45.609
And most of us stayed in Dad's career area in construction.

03:45.629 --> 03:48.475
A couple like my older brother and myself, we ventured out.

03:49.037 --> 03:55.390
Dad's response was, you can do whatever you want to do after you become a German electrician.

03:55.370 --> 04:04.874
And at age 18, all the boys were German electricians, and all the girls worked in the office, became office administrative people.

04:05.275 --> 04:12.754
That's a fascinating story, because you said that your dad was one of the first, if not the first, African-American electricians in the state of Alabama.

04:12.734 --> 04:13.415
Yes, he was.

04:13.635 --> 04:19.043
And rewind a little bit to your pre-college schooling.

04:19.063 --> 04:20.566
You went to a three-room schoolhouse.

04:22.368 --> 04:22.609
Yes.

04:22.789 --> 04:23.450
Three teachers.

04:24.171 --> 04:33.625
And what you were taught, you were taught to read and write, and as you stated to me earlier, pretty much just how to survive in the African-American community, right?

04:33.705 --> 04:35.147
Well, that is correct.

04:35.127 --> 04:43.399
Our school in our neighborhood was, as you indicated, a three-room school and three teachers, including the principal.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.862
Each teacher had two grades.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.549
A lot of times, the teachers spent a lot of time trying to keep control of the class.

04:50.669 --> 04:53.693
I was one of the bad guys, I hate to say, but I was.

04:53.673 --> 05:12.357
But it was one of the schools that did teach you how to read and write and to exist in the African-American community because the whole system was based on you staying in Montgomery, living in that community, and being able to find a job of some sort.

05:12.337 --> 05:23.864
And as I said, my father's desire was that we become electricians because his thought was that people will always need lights.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.751
And as long as they need lights, they need electricians.

05:26.992 --> 05:29.738
And so you would always be able to take care of yourself.

05:29.718 --> 05:30.499
Exactly.

05:31.601 --> 05:32.602
There were 11 of you.

05:33.063 --> 05:35.467
Like you said, all 11 of you went to college.

05:35.507 --> 05:36.468
Eight of you graduated.

05:37.209 --> 05:38.731
Some went to Alabama State.

05:38.751 --> 05:41.115
Others, like yourself, went to Tuskegee University.

05:41.636 --> 05:47.845
As we were discussing just a moment ago, of course, the home of the very famous World War II squadron, the Tuskegee Airmen.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.268
You graduated in May of 67.

05:50.648 --> 05:51.609
You were married in June.

05:51.689 --> 05:59.338
You went into the Air Force in July and you were sent off to Madrid, Spain from Tuskegee, Alabama to Madrid, Spain.

05:59.378 --> 06:00.919
That was quite a culture shock.

06:00.939 --> 06:01.760
What an experience.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.022
What an experience.

06:03.082 --> 06:14.254
Two people who barely had ever left the state of Alabama graduated from college and find themselves in a few months in the middle of downtown Madrid, Spain in a

06:14.234 --> 06:21.684
a penthouse apartment, no Spanish capability, and starting out on an adventure.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.108
That continued.

06:24.228 --> 06:33.641
We moved, finally found a place to move, to live in, and within 11 months, we had our first child, and then 18 months later, we had our second child.

06:34.081 --> 06:41.011
And when you were there, you immediately took your training as a civil engineer to work there in Spain as a civil engineering program officer.

06:41.051 --> 06:43.414
Talk a little bit about what your duty was in Madrid.

06:43.816 --> 06:50.568
Well, my primary duty was to program projects that the base needed to have accomplished.

06:50.588 --> 06:57.100
I was on the programming end, the starting of the end, to submit the paperwork to the headquarters for the projects to get approved.

06:58.222 --> 07:07.258
After that stint, I was then moved to the engineering side of the house where I was able to supervise the design engineers.

07:07.238 --> 07:24.724
So from the program aspect, we went from there to the design aspect to get the project designed and advertised and work with Spanish contractors, which was an experience in itself, not speaking very much Spanish and dealing with them and trying to get projects moved along.

07:24.744 --> 07:30.512
They were not as ambitious in moving those projects along as we were, so that was always a...

07:30.492 --> 07:38.990
conversation or two with them, trying to encourage them and convince them that we needed the project today, not mañana.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.195
You were in Madrid for four years.

07:41.455 --> 07:45.063
Before you ever left, though, a buddy came up to you and had a suggestion for you.

07:45.764 --> 07:47.067
Talk about what that suggestion was.

07:47.047 --> 07:53.641
You know, my buddy Greg, Jim Greg, was a single guy, very kind of wild guy.

07:54.002 --> 07:55.244
You know, we got along great.

07:55.324 --> 07:55.926
I was married.

07:55.966 --> 07:56.607
He was single.

07:57.028 --> 08:00.575
He would come and spend time at my house, spend the night.

08:00.595 --> 08:02.159
And so we got to be very good friends.

08:02.179 --> 08:05.646
And one day he suggested that we go to Vietnam.

08:05.626 --> 08:09.092
And volunteer to go to Vietnam.

08:09.112 --> 08:10.975
And I said, Jim, why?

08:10.996 --> 08:16.044
And he said, hey, we could go work in that Red Horse squadron, that heavy equipment squadron, get a lot of experience.

08:16.064 --> 08:17.186
Those guys have a lot of fun.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.132
I have a friend who's over there, and he's just having a ball.

08:20.673 --> 08:21.875
So let's go volunteer.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.778
It was a construction unit.

08:23.798 --> 08:24.680
Yes, it was.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.603
The Air Force version of the Navy Seabees.

08:26.783 --> 08:27.284
Exactly.

08:27.385 --> 08:27.685
Yeah.

08:27.665 --> 08:36.698
So Jim and I go trucking down to personnel and say, we want to volunteer to go to Vietnam, and we want to be in the heavy construction unit.

08:37.359 --> 08:39.382
And they said, oh, yeah, we need people to do that.

08:39.722 --> 08:44.409
And so we both volunteered, but neither one of us got into the heavy construction unit.

08:44.870 --> 08:51.259
They sent Jim to the headquarters in Saigon and sent me to Pleiku Air Base in the central highlands up.

08:51.239 --> 08:56.394
WITH THE MOUNTAIN YARDS AND MOST OF THE ARMY GUYS AT TWO CORE HEADQUARTERS.

08:56.414 --> 08:58.540
SO THAT'S WHERE I SPENT MY TIME.

08:58.881 --> 09:01.949
SEPTEMBER OF 1971, THAT'S WHEN YOU WENT IN COUNTRY.

09:02.411 --> 09:06.362
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT DUTY AND WHAT IT INVOLVED.

09:06.342 --> 09:11.228
in charge of the base there as far as its maintenance and sort of its operation, right?

09:11.248 --> 09:11.789
That is correct.

09:12.109 --> 09:32.535
The operations and maintenance officer, what we refer to as the station civil engineer, was responsible for maintaining the buildings that the Air Force used as well as converting and turning over buildings to the Vietnamese Air Force.

09:32.515 --> 09:44.312
Part of that program that the military had at the time was that we were turning functions over to the Vietnamese so that we could withdraw from Vietnam.

09:44.332 --> 09:56.329
And that was my job, turning those buildings over one by one in perfect shape to the South Vietnamese Air Force engineers so they could maintain them.

09:56.309 --> 09:57.230
Right.

09:57.250 --> 10:02.097
This was not a dangerous tour, obviously, because talk about that.

10:02.217 --> 10:03.519
No, it was.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.403
It had its at-bats points.

10:07.044 --> 10:17.959
We were on the bottom side of the hill from Tukor headquarters, and the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese would shoot rockets at Tukor headquarters, and they would miss.

10:18.099 --> 10:24.949
We would say they had their three-level trainees up there shooting rockets, and they would come down in our part of that base,

10:24.929 --> 10:32.285
And I remember one morning I was at work around 6.15 and all of a sudden this big loud noise and everything happens.

10:32.385 --> 10:36.574
And after you're there for a while, there are instincts that take over.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.783
And before I know it, I was under my desk with my helmet on, with my flying jacket on.

10:41.524 --> 10:43.849
But I learned a lot from that.

10:43.829 --> 10:49.240
not to go to work that early by myself in that part of the base in the morning.

10:49.301 --> 10:51.245
So we got shot at quite a bit.

10:51.265 --> 10:59.863
And as the war progressed in 72, we were being shot at every morning around five o'clock.

10:59.843 --> 11:06.573
They would launch about 15 or 20 rockets at us, and thank God it didn't hit the trailers where we were staying at the time.

11:07.234 --> 11:12.142
So those were some scary moments for many of us Air Force people over there.

11:12.162 --> 11:18.612
Among your medals and decorations that you received, the Bronze Star Medal,

11:18.592 --> 11:25.323
and the Meritorious Service Medal with four Oakleaf clusters.

11:25.924 --> 11:29.589
Now, later on in this nine-month tour, sort of your duty changed.

11:29.629 --> 11:37.562
Talk a little bit about that, how that involved as far as navigation of airplanes and such that, a little bit outside of Pleiku.

11:38.048 --> 11:55.043
When we originally were assigned to this unit was there, we had what we refer to as a TACAN site up in the tri-border area, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and South Vietnam.

11:55.163 --> 12:04.692
And we had two airmen who maintained this site and maintained the generators in order to provide power for the site.

12:04.732 --> 12:08.055
And it was up in the triple canopy jungle.

12:08.035 --> 12:10.801
And I would have to go up there occasionally to check on them.

12:10.821 --> 12:12.444
They stayed overnight there.

12:12.945 --> 12:15.089
We would occasionally rotate them out.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.316
But as the war progressed, we would bring them out every night.

12:18.456 --> 12:26.432
And unfortunately, the last day they were scheduled to go, there was a lot of firefighting going on up in that area.

12:26.412 --> 12:33.665
They were dropped off, but the Army crew, the helicopter crew that went up there was shot down and all people were killed.

12:33.685 --> 12:36.370
And that was a sad day for all of us.

12:36.750 --> 12:46.648
And the Vietnamese then were moving down south and again started shooting at us on a more regular basis and a more consistent basis.

12:46.966 --> 12:58.883
Because of the acceleration of the transfer of the base to the South Vietnamese Air Force, you got to come home from, rather than the typical 12-month tour, you got to come home three months early.

12:58.943 --> 13:01.767
So you spent nine months when you did come home.

13:01.987 --> 13:07.896
I want to go to some photographs right now, and then we'll come back and talk about your post-Vietnam service, because there's a lot to talk about there.

13:08.397 --> 13:10.780
A few pictures that...

13:10.760 --> 13:13.103
This was taken in at Pleiku, is that right?

13:13.123 --> 13:14.285
This was at Pleiku.

13:14.305 --> 13:19.092
That was our uniform for the day, and I think that was probably about half of my tour there.

13:20.094 --> 13:23.919
I was out with probably the security police.

13:24.540 --> 13:35.376
The security police captain there had become one of my best friends, and we would do all kinds of crazy things like patrol the perimeter at night when we thought the big con would be coming by.

13:35.497 --> 13:40.564
It was just young men thinking that we could do a lot.

13:40.544 --> 13:44.274
And so that was one of the times that we were there.

13:44.294 --> 13:46.420
I asked you about the size of the Pleiku Air Base.

13:46.520 --> 13:52.375
You liked it a little bit to about the size of Easterwood Fielding College Station, but obviously a lot more buildings.

13:52.756 --> 13:56.747
This is an aerial shot taken in 1969, so this is...

13:56.727 --> 13:58.570
quite a bit the way it looked like when you were there.

13:59.130 --> 14:03.457
It certainly was, and if you look at the top of the picture, you would see the runway.

14:04.338 --> 14:14.753
As we were pulling out and moving equipment back, one of the projects I had to do was to install a different kind of barrier system

14:14.733 --> 14:20.441
there for the Vietnamese Air Force A1Es that would land there and take off there.

14:20.481 --> 14:26.469
And so I remember working out on that runway and the planes coming in.

14:26.549 --> 14:30.534
Some of them were shot up and we would have to evacuate the area for a while.

14:30.574 --> 14:35.561
Then we would go back and run back over there again and try to finish our project.

14:35.581 --> 14:37.763
Yeah, that has some memories.

14:37.783 --> 14:39.406
Let's move on to a few other pictures.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.989
You were about to get into a trainer, right?

14:42.087 --> 14:43.410
Yes.

14:43.430 --> 14:43.972
Take a flight.

14:44.694 --> 14:47.421
This was when I was at Williams Air Force Base.

14:47.501 --> 14:51.291
My commander and I were pretty close.

14:51.311 --> 14:57.126
I was the base engineer, squadron commander, and he was the wing commander.

14:57.106 --> 15:03.377
HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY THAT AS A MAINTENANCE OFFICER, I HAD ALL THE MONEY AND HE COULDN'T GET ANY.

15:03.537 --> 15:10.549
AND SO HE WOULD, HE PROMISED ME HE WOULD TAKE ME FOR A RIDE ON THE T-38 TRAINER, WHICH HE DID.

15:10.749 --> 15:12.853
AND HE DID ALL KIND OF

15:12.833 --> 15:16.762
I want to see how quickly he did get you to throw up, right?

15:16.782 --> 15:17.383
And he did.

15:17.504 --> 15:18.045
He did.

15:18.145 --> 15:22.495
And he laughed about it and told the whole wing about that.

15:22.836 --> 15:24.299
That Chuck Smith threw up.

15:24.359 --> 15:29.070
The funny thing, I hadn't eaten for a day trying to make sure he didn't.

15:29.050 --> 15:31.454
BUT THAT WAS AN ENJOYABLE.

15:31.474 --> 15:33.236
THIS WAS BEFORE THE FLIGHT AND YOU HAD A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

15:33.256 --> 15:33.837
YES, I DID.

15:34.118 --> 15:37.924
THE SMILE WASN'T QUITE THAT BIG AFTERWARDS.

15:38.144 --> 15:39.907
THIS WAS LATER ON.

15:40.087 --> 15:43.392
LATER ON AT WILLIAMS AFTER WE HAD A CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY.

15:45.235 --> 15:53.708
THERE WAS A REQUEST WENT OUT TO ALL THE LIEUTENANT COLONELS TO VOLUNTEER TO BE THE

15:53.688 --> 16:02.082
THE OFFICER IN CHARGE FOR THAT PARTICULAR OCCASION, I HELD MY HAND FIRST, AND THE WING COMMANDER SAYS, OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

16:02.964 --> 16:09.655
SO I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CHANGE OF COMMAND ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.100
That was when I was a little smaller and a lot more, better shape.

16:13.701 --> 16:16.325
Now this was, I guess, was this in Arizona also?

16:16.345 --> 16:17.587
This was also at Williams.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.411
This was in the golf pro shop.

16:21.392 --> 16:28.302
As you see from the badge, I was also the base fire marshal there at Williams Air Force Base.

16:28.282 --> 16:31.787
But I was, my boss also liked to play golf.

16:31.807 --> 16:47.210
And so we were then shopping, probably meeting one of the visitors that we would have in the wintertime coming from Washington area to review the base and get a little game of golf in at the same time.

16:47.770 --> 16:50.715
This is post-Vietnam, which we'll be talking about here in just a little bit.

16:51.456 --> 16:53.779
And here's a couple of accommodations.

16:53.799 --> 16:54.340
This is...

16:54.539 --> 17:07.039
I had completed by seminar the Air Command and Staff College, and I was presented my certificate by one of the colonels over at Maxwell Air Force Base there.

17:07.059 --> 17:07.200
Okay.

17:07.220 --> 17:10.004
And then another certificate.

17:10.725 --> 17:18.538
This is when the other gentleman and I, the other major and I, completed our Air War College by seminar.

17:18.518 --> 17:21.905
And I was really happy about that.

17:21.925 --> 17:26.195
We both were distinguished graduates of the seminar, and we're very pleased.

17:26.215 --> 17:29.181
And that was our wing commander giving us our certificates.

17:30.103 --> 17:32.869
And finally, I think we have your official Air Force photograph there.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.515
Yeah, that was me when I had...

17:35.495 --> 17:36.778
Black hair.

17:37.459 --> 17:38.481
It's all gray now.

17:39.002 --> 17:40.625
Towards the end of your service, I take it.

17:40.645 --> 17:41.286
Yes, it was.

17:41.427 --> 17:51.867
I had completed the Industrial College of Armed Forces in Residence, and this was when I was being signed to the Pentagon.

17:53.264 --> 17:55.608
So we got a lot to talk about post-Vietnam, obviously.

17:55.648 --> 18:01.718
When you came back from Vietnam, you told me that your first plan was to get out and go back to work for your dad.

18:01.738 --> 18:05.484
But then your family got together and said, hey, we don't want to go back to Alabama.

18:05.524 --> 18:06.866
Do you not like what you're doing?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.269
And you said, sure, I like it.

18:08.309 --> 18:09.130
So you stayed in.

18:09.110 --> 18:20.164
My five-year-old son and, well, the wife and the two kids at the time, and I was sitting at the table, and we had about three or four weeks to go in the service.

18:20.184 --> 18:24.850
And so I was just commenting, well, we're getting out of the Air Force pretty soon.

18:25.511 --> 18:29.035
And my oldest son, Anthony, said, Dad, why are we getting out?

18:29.115 --> 18:30.076
I like the Air Force.

18:30.136 --> 18:32.359
And my wife commented, yeah, I do too.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.662
So we don't want to go back to Alabama.

18:34.642 --> 18:37.246
We don't want to go back and work with them.

18:37.446 --> 18:47.583
They didn't really want me to go back and work for Dad because they'd enjoyed the traveling around, and they knew Dad was a pretty tough taskmaster as he was when we were growing up.

18:47.603 --> 18:51.669
So they suggested that we stay in.

18:52.450 --> 18:57.358
And fortunately for me, I had been...

18:57.338 --> 19:22.587
Given a real a fantastic Commander to work for I shouldn't say I had been given he was he was assigned to the base and and we hit it off real real well Colonel Dan Taylor and Colonel Taylor and I hit it off and and I went to tell him that I really didn't want to get out of my family I really liked and so I

19:22.567 --> 19:31.359
He hand-carried the paperwork through it, and within two weeks' time, I was back in the service, headed now for a real serious career.

19:33.862 --> 19:38.809
First stop, Andrews Air Force Base, where you were an assistant director of construction management.

19:39.450 --> 19:45.238
Within less than a year, you were asked to be the chief of operations, still at Andrews, with 400 people under your command.

19:45.558 --> 19:47.120
That was a tremendous assignment.

19:47.821 --> 19:51.426
I went to Colonel Taylor, and I said to Colonel Taylor,

19:51.406 --> 20:02.862
You know, I had a crew when I was 16, and I think I know how to manage and lead people, and I'd like to have the opportunity to fill this position until the permanent replacement gets in.

20:03.042 --> 20:05.205
And he said, you sure you can do it?

20:05.265 --> 20:07.869
And I told him, I convinced him that I could.

20:08.630 --> 20:15.539
And so six months later, when the permanent person came in, he said, you're doing such a great job, I'm going to keep you in the job.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.143
Yeah, and the new guy got your old job, right?

20:18.163 --> 20:19.725
The new guy got my old job, right?

20:19.705 --> 20:27.957
You were sent for your second tour in Europe, this time to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

20:28.277 --> 20:28.878
Talk about there.

20:28.898 --> 20:30.440
You were there for eight months.

20:30.741 --> 20:31.302
I was there.

20:31.963 --> 20:39.233
After eight months, I had gone up and volunteered to the executive officer for the Civil Engineer for a year

20:39.213 --> 20:47.063
if he wanted to go on leave or had something to do, because I wanted to learn more about the Air Force in Europe.

20:48.004 --> 21:04.866
And somehow that information got communicated to the chief, and so when this individual first decided to take some leave, they asked me up, and I went up for a day or two, I think it was a day or two, and they liked me, and they liked me,

21:04.846 --> 21:34.617
the way I went about doing things, and so this individual received an assignment, and they asked me to come up and take the job permanently, which was, again, another tough job for me, because it was 12 hours a day, five days a week, six hours on Saturday, and at the same time, I was working on completing a master's degree with the University of Southern California Extension Program there, and finishing up one of my military education programs,

21:34.597 --> 21:37.322
classes that I had to take.

21:37.362 --> 21:45.516
So it was the days that I saw the sun go down and I saw it come back up again, particularly working statistics in my master's program.

21:45.556 --> 21:46.758
That was a toughie for me.

21:46.838 --> 21:52.427
Doing all of this, trying to tend to your family, get some sleep, do all of that in only 24 hours.

21:53.249 --> 21:59.980
So whatever work ethic you had not learned as a child in Alabama, you certainly learned at this period of your military service.

21:59.960 --> 22:15.015
it would it it it was a time that i will never forget it was a time that i would not necessarily want to do over again but certainly i'm very appreciative for having the opportunity to do all those things at the same time and having

22:14.995 --> 22:18.943
the family stand behind me and move forward.

22:19.323 --> 22:32.970
It's time to go back to the States, and you were assigned, of all places, to go back home, to Montgomery, Alabama, where you thought you were going to be for long enough, so long that you bought a house, but then, as so often happens with the military, things can change in a moment, right?

22:33.085 --> 22:43.118
Yes, they told me that I was going to be there for at least another two years at Gunter Air Force Station in Alabama, and a month after I bought the house, I got an assignment.

22:43.759 --> 22:44.480
To go to Illinois.

22:44.560 --> 22:50.968
To go to Illinois, to go to Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois, which did not make a happy camper.

22:51.649 --> 22:51.709
No.

22:51.729 --> 22:52.490
Weather wasn't good.

22:52.590 --> 22:53.271
Is gold there?

22:53.251 --> 22:56.760
Cold snow would be up to the eaves of the house.

22:56.841 --> 23:02.556
It would get the wind chill factor up to past 50 degrees below zero in the wintertime.

23:02.636 --> 23:04.361
It was a tough assignment.

23:04.421 --> 23:09.775
But it turned out, Tom, to be my best assignment in terms of career advancement.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.477
You worked for a female general there.

23:11.497 --> 23:12.318
You were there from 78 to 81.

23:12.338 --> 23:12.719
Yes.

23:12.819 --> 23:15.061
You worked for a female general there.

23:15.242 --> 23:39.171
Yes, and she took care of me, and from the standpoint that when my two years was up and I was ready to go, it was a three-year assignment, but I was ready to go at two, and I told her I was ready to go, and she went and talked to the right people, and I was able to get an assignment as a squadron commander there at Williams Air Force Base.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.674
What you called a plum assignment at Williams Air Force Base.

23:41.714 --> 23:42.735
It was a plum assignment.

23:42.795 --> 23:45.658
It was a busy base, doing the things that you loved to do.

23:45.958 --> 23:46.219
Yes.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.582
Besides working, besides being an engineer, playing a little golf too.

23:49.602 --> 23:50.824
We had our own golf course.

23:51.645 --> 23:59.413
We did a lot of training programs on that golf course, like build a pond so that the hole wouldn't be a boring hole.

23:59.453 --> 24:01.415
You had to hit over water many times.

24:01.976 --> 24:04.939
We did that with our training teams.

24:04.919 --> 24:06.661
Right, right, right.

24:07.062 --> 24:09.645
You started playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base.

24:09.665 --> 24:13.390
As a matter of fact, that's where he's an accomplished golfer right now, folks.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.311
I'll tell you that right now.

24:14.631 --> 24:18.516
We've only got about three and a half minutes left, so we've got to kind of move on.

24:18.536 --> 24:21.740
You were promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on time.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.943
You were hoping for an early promotion.

24:23.963 --> 24:28.328
You didn't get that, but it was followed by a quite early promotion to Colonel.

24:28.308 --> 24:37.690
Yes, it was a surprise to me as well as to a lot of people that I was promoted two years ahead of my contemporary for full colonel.

24:38.171 --> 24:46.030
And I suppose I was disappointed because I didn't make it early as lieutenant colonel.

24:46.010 --> 24:47.151
I'd worked pretty hard.

24:47.531 --> 24:52.616
There were certain things you have to do to be competitive, and one like have a master's degree.

24:53.297 --> 25:07.331
Another would have all your military training courses completed and hopefully completed near the top of your class so that you get that extra recognition and get your performance reports endorsed at the highest level.

25:08.572 --> 25:12.316
That is, if your supervisor agreed, that's what needs to be done.

25:12.396 --> 25:14.818
And I had those.

25:14.798 --> 25:19.404
But it was just one of those things that the Air Force had its time.

25:19.504 --> 25:25.191
I had mine, and they had that timeline, and that timeline was the one that we had to follow.

25:25.952 --> 25:36.064
You were transferred to the Pentagon as chief engineer for Air Force Building and Systems, a job that you quite frankly called boring for a guy that had been in the field for most of his career.

25:36.044 --> 25:45.836
And that's when you got a call from Colonel Dan Taylor, who was in San Diego at the time, and that's when your life kind of changed right then.

25:45.856 --> 25:51.663
Yes, they wanted me to come out and apply for that job as a physical plant director.

25:51.683 --> 25:59.533
I was not really ready to do that, and I told them that, but they convinced me to come out.

25:59.613 --> 26:03.418
And when I went there, I didn't think that I was going to get the job,

26:03.398 --> 26:04.780
They offered me the job.

26:04.840 --> 26:19.686
Then I was in a quandary because I had to complete three years worth of military service to make up for my year of residency there at school at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.

26:19.919 --> 26:27.653
However, one of my other bosses was able to get the Secretary of Air Force to give me a waiver to waiver that.

26:28.174 --> 26:35.548
And the other thing I had to do is that I had to give up being a full colonel and retire as a lieutenant colonel.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.533
Which is a little bit of a pay change.

26:37.673 --> 26:45.593
We've got just less than a minute left, so the rest of the story goes that you went to work at San Diego State in charge of facilities there.

26:46.114 --> 26:48.981
In 1995, you decided you needed to change the scenery.

26:49.001 --> 26:52.710
You applied for the job at A&M, and you've been here for some 15 years.

26:52.690 --> 26:54.793
Almost 15 years, yes.

26:54.813 --> 26:55.034
Right.

26:55.815 --> 26:56.837
Believe it or not, we're out of time.

26:56.857 --> 27:03.307
This goes so fast, but we've just jetted through quite a life so far, some 65 years.

27:03.327 --> 27:05.691
And thank you very much for your service and for being here.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.334
And thank you for inviting me.

27:07.354 --> 27:07.915
All right.

27:07.895 --> 27:24.995
When Chuck Sippial made the tough decision to leave the Air Force to go to work at San Diego State in 1989, it was a choice that would eventually benefit not only A&M and its tremendous growth, but our entire community that has respected his vast volunteer work and friendship for 15 years.

27:25.015 --> 27:30.562
And now you know about his talents as he served the United States as an officer in the United States Air Force.

27:31.142 --> 27:33.865
We salute Colonel Chuck Sippial for his service to our country.

27:34.326 --> 27:35.287
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:35.748 --> 27:37.750
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
