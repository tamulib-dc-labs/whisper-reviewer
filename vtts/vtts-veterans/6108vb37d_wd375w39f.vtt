First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:06.377 --> 00:28.198
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:28.735 --> 00:48.253
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:48.273 --> 00:49.275
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:50.234 --> 00:56.401
Of the 30 years that Lee McCleskey served his country as an Air Force flyer, one day does stand out.

00:56.922 --> 01:03.669
February 22, 1967, an attack mission out of Thailand into North Vietnam.

01:03.689 --> 01:07.814
It was the day his A-26 invader took off but did not land.

01:07.834 --> 01:14.622
He had many, many better days of service in the Air Force, and yes, today as a volunteer for the Brazos Food Bank.

01:14.602 --> 01:18.647
Please welcome to Veteran to the Valley, Colonel Lee McCleskey of College Station.

01:18.687 --> 01:21.190
Lee, it's an honor to have you on Veteran to the Valley.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.112
And again, thank you for your service.

01:23.172 --> 01:24.454
You were born in Georgia.

01:24.714 --> 01:29.319
You wanted to go to school and study agriculture and be a farmer, but your life took another path.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.380
You never got to be a farmer.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.243
You may still yet get to be a farmer.

01:32.443 --> 01:32.963
It's not over.

01:33.424 --> 01:33.744
Indeed.

01:34.285 --> 01:38.550
Talk about your schooling first, because you were told about this

01:38.665 --> 01:42.557
relatively new school in Colorado called the Air Force Academy.

01:42.577 --> 01:46.148
Sort of take us from there and sort of how your military service continued from there.

01:46.489 --> 01:46.870
All right.

01:47.778 --> 01:54.411
The Air Force Academy was two years old when I graduated from high school in 57.

01:56.736 --> 02:10.242
I had an excellent teacher in the senior year and she was a close family friend too and since her husband had been an attack pilot in Korea,

02:10.475 --> 02:17.163
She was kind of interested in looking around for people who might be good for the Air Force, in her opinion.

02:17.644 --> 02:21.609
So somehow I got identified as a tractor driver.

02:23.111 --> 02:31.702
So she suggested that if I was at all interested in going there, that she would help me with the paperwork.

02:31.802 --> 02:37.309
Well, that paperwork scared me more than the rest of it, so she did.

02:37.542 --> 02:41.888
Lo and behold, I wound up receiving an appointment there.

02:44.612 --> 02:59.652
Spent four years at the academy, the first year being in Denver where the temporary site was and then the permanent site at Colorado Springs was completed and we moved down there in the summer of 58.

02:59.632 --> 03:10.792
and graduated in summer of 61 and immediately went to flight school in South Georgia, in Valdosta, Georgia.

03:10.932 --> 03:11.453
Right, Moody?

03:12.014 --> 03:14.399
At Moody, yes.

03:14.699 --> 03:16.763
From Moody

03:16.743 --> 03:23.115
I drew a first assignment as an instructor pilot and that was at Laughlin at Del Rio.

03:23.456 --> 03:23.716
Right.

03:23.896 --> 03:25.459
And we spent four years there.

03:25.479 --> 03:26.802
And you enjoyed that, didn't you?

03:26.822 --> 03:27.704
Oh, very much so.

03:27.724 --> 03:29.527
We really liked Del Rio at that time.

03:29.787 --> 03:31.290
Right.

03:31.891 --> 03:40.287
Then from Laughlin it came time to go to the war and I received an assignment to

03:41.802 --> 03:43.929
do my part in the Vietnam operation.

03:44.310 --> 03:45.092
Indeed.

03:45.112 --> 03:46.637
In the A26s.

03:47.058 --> 03:47.299
Right.

03:47.821 --> 03:52.195
An old World War II and Korea airplane.

03:52.215 --> 03:52.335
Right.

03:53.058 --> 04:02.108
It had been modified, and it was actually the forerunner of today's A-10, except it was propeller driven as opposed to jet.

04:02.709 --> 04:06.393
I want to go a step back in how you got into the A-26.

04:06.753 --> 04:12.079
You had been an instructor in T-37s and T-38s, and you got a call from Randolph.

04:12.239 --> 04:13.440
Sort of talk about that phone call.

04:14.261 --> 04:16.223
Yes, that was interesting.

04:16.284 --> 04:17.665
I was called to personnel.

04:18.168 --> 04:39.754
for my assignment and since I had nothing but a jet background they wanted to know if I was a volunteer and I said volunteer for what and he said I can't tell you it's a classified assignment so I told the sergeant I didn't want to volunteer for something that I that

04:39.920 --> 04:41.722
I didn't know it was on the other end.

04:42.562 --> 04:46.986
So he called Randolph and told them that, and he said, he won't tell me.

04:47.046 --> 04:49.588
He's sitting right here, but he won't tell me.

04:50.329 --> 04:51.830
So they said, well, tell him.

04:52.991 --> 04:57.235
So they told me what it was, and I said, yeah, I'll try that.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.778
Right, because there was another plane that you weren't really interested in, flying the Bird Dog, right?

05:00.798 --> 05:05.862
Yeah, I didn't want to fly the Bird Dog, the 01 FAC airplane in particular.

05:06.603 --> 05:08.384
Low and slow didn't impress me.

05:08.824 --> 05:09.505
Indeed.

05:09.772 --> 05:10.493
Indeed.

05:10.513 --> 05:21.587
The A26, now you sort of regarded this as possibly an experiment because you had been in jet aircraft and now you're to an old World War II and Korea plane, a propeller driven airplane.

05:21.607 --> 05:22.088
That's right.

05:22.588 --> 05:32.981
The airplanes have been modified in the early 60s to bring them up more to date, but they were still World War II airframes.

05:33.983 --> 05:35.965
Another instructor pilot,

05:36.603 --> 05:47.293
from T-38s who had been instructing at Webb at Big Spring was assigned to the A-26-2 at the same time that I was.

05:47.313 --> 05:59.624
And that's when I thought, just standing back, looking at some of the other air crews, it looked to me like it was somebody's social experiment there that we were entered into.

06:00.404 --> 06:00.524
Right.

06:00.544 --> 06:03.247
Talk a little bit about the job of the A-26 and your job.

06:03.267 --> 06:04.568
This was an attack aircraft.

06:05.054 --> 06:29.672
It was attack, we were not used in, well, we were used in close air support in some occasions, but it was in support of Laotian resistance forces in Northern Laos, or the primary mission was truck killing, destruction of trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in North Vietnam and in Laos.

06:29.692 --> 06:32.817
And it was at night and it was single ship.

06:34.062 --> 06:37.826
So we were out there working alone in the dark.

06:38.446 --> 06:41.609
So you essentially were looking for enemy convoys of trucks.

06:41.629 --> 06:42.450
Exactly.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.511
And trying to destroy them.

06:43.531 --> 06:43.992
And to eliminate them.

06:44.192 --> 06:44.452
Yes.

06:44.832 --> 06:45.513
And to eliminate.

06:45.953 --> 06:46.814
Right.

06:47.895 --> 06:51.899
As we referred to in the opening, there is one day, February the 22nd, 1967.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.322
Obviously a day that you will never forget.

06:55.963 --> 06:58.466
Take us through that day, what your mission was.

06:58.926 --> 07:01.048
Sort of take us through what happened.

07:01.957 --> 07:07.524
That particular evening, I was scheduled for a mission into northern Laos.

07:08.626 --> 07:23.004
And before we left the briefing area, we were told that reconnaissance aircraft had reported numerous truck convoys out in the center of Laos.

07:23.024 --> 07:30.073
And they had asked us from the headquarters down in Saigon to divert everything we could against those convoys.

07:30.323 --> 07:39.321
So our mission was changed to go straight out into Laos, in the center south of Muguilla Pass.

07:40.623 --> 07:45.092
One of my buddies, that fellow I referred to earlier as having been at Webb,

07:45.629 --> 08:01.309
in the T-38s was just returning from a mission and the commander opted to reload him with nothing but ordnance because adding flares to which we had to use

08:01.289 --> 08:11.721
because of the darkness, would delay him in getting out there, and since I had a double load of flares, they said, all right, you two team up.

08:12.161 --> 08:25.876
As I said before, we normally flew single ship, but in this case, I understood what they were talking about, and so did he, and he couldn't wait to get out there anyway, so we were teamed and went out and joined up, and we did find a convoy.

08:26.417 --> 08:26.537
Right.

08:27.513 --> 08:30.517
Not exactly what was advertised, but you found a convoy.

08:30.537 --> 08:40.592
Yes, as was often the case, the intelligence didn't quite come true in all aspects.

08:41.173 --> 08:48.123
I don't think Mr. Bush lied at that time, but the story didn't come out quite that way.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.787
But we did find a convoy of...

08:51.104 --> 08:54.451
Oh, about 10 trucks, 8 or 10, something like that.

08:54.471 --> 09:05.295
And so since I had the flares, I provided flare support for him, and he attacked, and I also provided flak suppression.

09:05.315 --> 09:09.805
That is, anybody who was shooting at him, I returned fire for him.

09:10.342 --> 09:14.526
And after he had expended his ordinance, then we switched positions.

09:14.546 --> 09:22.793
Although, again, I had the flare, but he provided the flak suppression while I finished the convoy up.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.795
Right, right, right.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.397
And go on.

09:27.797 --> 09:36.985
Well, we had been, both of us had been harassed by a particular gun emplacement, which happened to be very close to the convoy.

09:37.726 --> 09:39.387
And we were making...

09:39.502 --> 09:46.112
passes along the convoy and this guy was getting closer and closer with his machine gun.

09:47.033 --> 10:04.699
So I opted to take him out by just letting the nose of the airplane rise a little with eight 50 caliber machine guns in the nose so that it was on him and then I sprayed the woods pretty good where he was.

10:05.590 --> 10:22.776
Well, that put me down pretty low under the flares, and when I pulled off, I kind of turned into a silhouette for a gun that was about five miles to the south, a 37-millimeter anti-aircraft gun, like Jane Fonda made famous.

10:23.857 --> 10:29.826
And the guy got off a pretty good shot at me because one of those rounds,

10:30.211 --> 10:39.328
hitting me in the bottom of the airplane and blew a large hole in the right main fuel tank and we lost 250 gallons of gasoline.

10:39.368 --> 10:41.772
At today's prices, that would have been pretty expensive.

10:42.594 --> 10:46.200
But it also started a small fire.

10:47.703 --> 10:52.692
So it was time to go home and we headed back home at that point.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.431
I want people to understand that we're talking about, this is about 2 a.m.

10:55.451 --> 10:59.160
in the morning, so this is pitch black that all of this is going on.

10:59.601 --> 11:00.103
Absolutely.

11:00.123 --> 11:02.709
When your plane's on fire, that illuminates pretty good.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.711
You know that it's on fire.

11:04.052 --> 11:04.754
That's right.

11:04.774 --> 11:05.375
Right, right.

11:07.481 --> 11:10.528
Because it was in the area of the right engine

11:11.268 --> 11:23.927
We talked about, and my buddy was coming back with me in the other airplane, and he and I were discussing back and forth whether we might be able to stop the fire by shutting the engine down.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.579
So I did.

11:25.759 --> 11:30.043
I shut the engine down and he said, no, that didn't do it.

11:32.505 --> 11:39.711
We had the option of firing what they call a fire bottle in there, some foam suppression stuff.

11:39.731 --> 11:45.396
So I fired one of those and he said, you almost got it.

11:45.416 --> 11:53.003
Well, then I had to decide, all right, how long do I sit with that and wait for it to come back or try to put it out right now?

11:53.624 --> 11:57.028
Well, I waited a couple of minutes and he said, it's coming back pretty good.

11:57.809 --> 11:59.791
So I said, all right, I'll try the second one.

11:59.811 --> 12:00.371
And I did.

12:00.692 --> 12:04.075
And he said, you almost got it.

12:05.897 --> 12:07.639
Almost in the key word here.

12:07.719 --> 12:09.061
No, that's right.

12:09.842 --> 12:11.143
So we were stuck with that.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.966
I had no more ways to fight the fire.

12:14.387 --> 12:20.273
And with the engine already shut down, we just decided to work our way back

12:20.641 --> 12:22.684
hopefully out of enemy territory.

12:22.804 --> 12:29.093
I was not too enamored about having to bail out where the enemy was.

12:29.113 --> 12:29.714
Certainly not.

12:29.914 --> 12:31.477
About how far were you from the river?

12:32.418 --> 12:38.947
We were about 60 miles or so out in the center, maybe a little more.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.772
And not a whole lot of fuel because you'd lost 250 gallons immediately.

12:42.292 --> 12:47.900
Yes, although I wasn't burning but half as much fuel, so yeah, I had enough to make it.

12:48.081 --> 12:49.062
You had enough to make it.

12:49.244 --> 12:58.774
Yes, it was fairly early in the mission, well, about the middle of the mission, and that was one of the advantages of the airplane is it had what are called long legs.

12:58.794 --> 13:00.716
It had a long endurance time.

13:00.736 --> 13:01.757
Right, right.

13:01.777 --> 13:05.782
But your plane was still on fire, so you're trying to get back home.

13:06.522 --> 13:17.614
Yes, and my friend was back about a mile or so behind me and slightly off to the side, and we were working our way back with...

13:18.218 --> 13:42.538
discussions going on over the radio back and forth and it began to look like we might make it although I was not enamored with the idea of because it was burning under the airplane trying to land on a pierced steel planking runway with sparks going everywhere and they just gear up causing the sparks to go everywhere.

13:43.109 --> 13:46.859
But that would have been better than bailing out, I thought at the time.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.203
Sure, sure.

13:49.045 --> 13:53.878
As we progressed along, the fire continued to spread.

13:54.010 --> 14:00.136
We heard the right main gear tire explode because it had burned in that area.

14:00.156 --> 14:10.446
There was a glass plate in the floor of the cockpit between my feet where I could see into the nose gear area and I could see the fire burning through that glass plate.

14:10.906 --> 14:13.929
That was not a comforting thought either.

14:15.090 --> 14:21.216
Then as we approached the river, the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand,

14:22.833 --> 14:26.377
We felt a series of small explosions.

14:26.397 --> 14:39.753
I say we, my navigator and I. And my buddy who was following us said, you're coming apart and you're about to blow up is what he was saying without saying it directly.

14:40.594 --> 14:45.360
And I had, just as he said that, I had reached up and jettisoned the canopy.

14:46.021 --> 14:47.743
And so we could bail out.

14:48.601 --> 14:50.664
We had no ejection seats in the airplane.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.806
It was strictly a manual bailout.

14:54.849 --> 14:57.813
Well, my navigator had a little difficulty getting out.

14:58.714 --> 15:08.787
He got blown down by the wind blast over the back of his seat, and we struggled with his departure for a little while.

15:09.323 --> 15:13.588
I let go of the airplane to help him, and I looked around.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.311
The airplane was pretty much out of control.

15:16.391 --> 15:19.354
Well, it was doing some things it shouldn't have been doing.

15:19.374 --> 15:26.742
So I stopped helping him, got the airplane back in control, and then assisted him in getting over the side.

15:28.704 --> 15:33.370
And I immediately turned and bailed out myself as soon as he had left.

15:33.390 --> 15:38.335
Sometime between the time I left the cockpit and the time my parachute opened,

15:38.990 --> 15:41.332
my airplane disintegrated.

15:41.793 --> 15:45.217
So I guess you could say I rode it as far as I could.

15:46.037 --> 15:49.982
We had just crossed the Mekong River back into Thailand.

15:50.322 --> 15:52.244
And we're not too far from the base.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.949
Both of us had good parachutes.

15:57.730 --> 16:02.094
As you were coming out, I want to step back a second.

16:02.134 --> 16:07.680
As you were coming out of the plane, you had ripped your flight suit on something and your exposed leg

16:08.251 --> 16:11.155
hit the tail stabilizer, right?

16:11.175 --> 16:11.535
Yes.

16:12.977 --> 16:21.468
The airplane didn't have a good history of successful bailouts and I can see why.

16:22.469 --> 16:31.761
I did hit the tail on the way out with the back of one leg and that's why I spent some time in the hospital after that.

16:33.209 --> 16:47.509
The manual said for a controlled bailout that you put down some electrically operated flaps to increase the downwash over the wing so you would clear the tail.

16:47.529 --> 16:54.238
Well, if you have been having electrical trouble up to the bailout point and things are frantic,

16:54.607 --> 16:58.653
there's hardly any time to fool with electric flaps.

16:58.673 --> 17:00.476
I probably could not have gotten them down.

17:01.197 --> 17:02.879
So maybe that's why I hit the tail.

17:02.899 --> 17:05.523
Maybe it's because I didn't dive deeply enough.

17:05.644 --> 17:06.084
I don't know.

17:06.885 --> 17:08.768
So both you and your navigator had good shoots.

17:09.389 --> 17:09.810
We did.

17:10.671 --> 17:20.826
And we landed within about a mile of each other in a rice paddy that's as hard as this floor here because it was a dry season in northeast Thailand.

17:22.589 --> 17:23.230
We...

17:24.779 --> 17:30.146
were then the beneficiary of a free helicopter ride back to the base.

17:30.166 --> 17:42.140
They scrambled two Jolly Green Giants for us, and I say they, the Wing Commander, because he had been monitoring this whole thing over the air as we were coming back.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.704
And it was one of the first night pickups of the war.

17:45.724 --> 17:46.165
Is that right?

17:47.326 --> 17:47.427
Yeah.

17:47.447 --> 17:54.415
There was some concern, even though we landed in Thailand, that we were very close to a North Vietnamese village.

17:55.323 --> 18:06.477
North Vietnamese who had evacuated Dien Bien Phu in that area or North Vietnam after the fall of Dien Bien Phu in 1955.

18:08.239 --> 18:17.751
We didn't know what their allegiance was, so they didn't want to take any chances with us getting captured by a local villager.

18:17.771 --> 18:19.854
Right, right, right.

18:19.874 --> 18:24.840
I want to pause right now and I want to go to some photographs before we run out of time and then we'll come back.

18:25.276 --> 18:30.322
And there's another aspect to the story that I want you to talk about also.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.525
Let's go ahead and go to some pictures, just a few pictures that we have.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.588
There you are.

18:35.788 --> 18:39.692
Ralph, where was that picture taken in your career?

18:39.712 --> 18:48.642
That was taken at the Pentagon just before I went to my last assignment at Davis Month in the Air Force Base in Tucson.

18:48.862 --> 18:49.343
Okay.

18:52.495 --> 18:53.376
When is this taken?

18:53.396 --> 19:00.808
Interestingly, that one was taken in Austria while I was on air attaché duty in Vienna.

19:01.209 --> 19:01.509
Right.

19:01.529 --> 19:03.913
And I was flying with the Austrian Air Force.

19:04.113 --> 19:06.196
They were kind enough to give me a ride.

19:06.216 --> 19:07.398
I see.

19:07.418 --> 19:10.042
Is there a picture of you getting a congratulations?

19:10.343 --> 19:18.856
That was when I initially received my attaché assignment, and that's the deputy chief of staff for intelligence for the Air Force.

19:19.297 --> 19:19.397
Okay.

19:20.305 --> 19:26.794
Next picture, this is a pretty good representation of the T-38, which is what you initially trained in.

19:26.994 --> 19:30.920
Yes, that's what I flew Air Superiority over West Texas in.

19:30.940 --> 19:33.443
Right, right.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.466
Now, here is not an exact representation.

19:35.486 --> 19:39.492
This is an A-26, not an exact representation of what you flew in Vietnam.

19:39.772 --> 19:43.377
Talk about the difference between the airplane that we're looking at and what you flew.

19:44.015 --> 19:49.866
I don't think that one has but six machine guns in the nose, but it's the same place.

19:49.886 --> 20:01.346
And the major difference externally like that is that the one I flew had been modified to put tip tanks on it, which gave us much more fuel and endurance.

20:01.627 --> 20:04.432
But this is essentially the airplane you flew from the A26.

20:04.833 --> 20:07.778
And I think we have one more shot of it from the...

20:07.758 --> 20:09.901
Okay, nope, that was the A26 right there.

20:10.101 --> 20:14.288
This is the medals in some of your awards that hang in your home.

20:14.908 --> 20:27.266
And of course, obviously, the one that I'm sure that everybody recognizes, the top row, second from the right, the Purple Heart that you received and many other commendations.

20:27.286 --> 20:28.348
There's a...

20:29.273 --> 20:58.808
silver star in there yes there are two silver stars two silver stars yes right i know you're very proud of that and this last picture is of your sons quite a few years ago but i know you're proud of that picture because they were all scouts they're all aggies uh have been in the military some of them and those are your sons you also have a daughter but uh that's a great picture so i just wanted to show it we're pretty proud of them because they all did make eagle scout right right

20:59.615 --> 21:06.833
And all four of your children are Texas A&M grads and doing very well.

21:06.854 --> 21:16.037
I want to go back and put you in that cockpit on February the 22nd, 1967, because you told me something that I know that's very important to you.

21:16.540 --> 21:20.725
You heard a voice, and it wasn't your navigator, and it didn't come over your radio.

21:20.745 --> 21:21.365
Talk about that.

21:21.506 --> 21:21.906
I did.

21:21.926 --> 21:27.212
This was probably at the height of the frantic period.

21:27.432 --> 21:33.479
We were about two-thirds of the way back, and electrical problems were growing, and the fire was growing.

21:35.041 --> 21:42.970
And as clear as crystal, I heard a voice that said to me, don't worry, it's going to be all right.

21:43.237 --> 21:48.366
There is no doubt in my mind that was the voice of God speaking.

21:49.548 --> 21:52.694
And here I am, so I guess it worked out.

21:53.174 --> 21:54.477
Indeed.

21:54.497 --> 21:59.726
Unfortunately, this ending is not a happy ending completely.

21:59.906 --> 22:00.287
No, no.

22:00.307 --> 22:03.553
And if you can, tell me about it.

22:03.713 --> 22:03.793
Yes.

22:04.803 --> 22:10.754
Earlier I referred several times to my friend and his A26 following me back.

22:12.036 --> 22:13.920
That's the sad part of the story.

22:13.940 --> 22:24.419
Either he flew through my debris when my airplane blew up or he had what is called a sympathetic explosion from some ordnance he had left on board.

22:24.439 --> 22:27.064
I think he had some rockets.

22:28.107 --> 22:45.492
regardless of what caused it he went into as observed by a flare ship overhead he went into a flat glide and crashed there in northeast thailand and he and his navigator were killed that night right uh

22:45.843 --> 22:50.296
This was just one year of your 30 years of service that we've talked about your one year in Vietnam.

22:50.316 --> 22:53.806
And we've spent an awful lot of time talking about one day out of that year.

22:53.846 --> 22:56.794
But obviously, I wanted people to hear that story.

22:57.135 --> 23:01.287
You were you were out of Vietnam and back home after one year, but your career

23:01.773 --> 23:09.364
just went everywhere, including actually two tours and a final tour of Texas A&M also.

23:09.424 --> 23:15.813
So sort of take us after Vietnam, sort of take us your career, the places that you went and the things that you did.

23:15.833 --> 23:19.418
We've got about five minutes, so go quickly.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.541
Okay.

23:21.561 --> 23:26.869
After I came back from Vietnam, I was assigned to England Air Force Base in Alexandria, Louisiana.

23:26.849 --> 23:39.164
teaching air-to-ground gunnery in a smaller airplane than the A26, but it was for South Vietnamese pilots as well as American pilots on the way to the war.

23:39.184 --> 23:52.401
From there, I went to the Air Force Intermediate School, Air Command and Staff College, and then to a headquarters staff job in Europe, in Germany, at Wiesbaden and Ramstein.

23:53.191 --> 24:00.438
Coming out of Ramstein is when I picked up the ROTC assignment to Texas A&M, not on a voluntary basis.

24:01.199 --> 24:03.421
I fought it all the way, but it didn't do any good.

24:04.382 --> 24:08.486
It turned out, though, it was one of the best tours we had in the Air Force.

24:08.506 --> 24:09.847
We really enjoyed being here.

24:09.907 --> 24:19.637
And I guess we got Aggie smeared on us because of all the kids having been graduates from there.

24:19.617 --> 24:28.569
After leaving here, I went back to another Air Force school and then on to England for a tour with the U.S.

24:28.589 --> 24:30.252
Syncure Airborne Command Post.

24:31.233 --> 24:39.905
And then from there over to the job as base commander at a major fighter base in Germany called Hahn Air Base.

24:39.925 --> 24:49.118
And from Hahn was when I was offered an assignment to Vienna as the air attache at the embassy.

24:49.655 --> 24:53.742
We had wanted to go to Switzerland as the area out of Shea.

24:53.882 --> 24:58.970
I say we, my wife and I thought that we loved Switzerland, so we thought that'd be good.

24:59.631 --> 25:02.055
But Austria was excellent too.

25:02.135 --> 25:05.280
We still have friends from all over who were there with us.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.482
You had three years there, right?

25:06.749 --> 25:19.160
three years in the embassy in Vienna, and then back to the Pentagon for a four-year tour in the office of the Defense Intelligence Agency Inspector General.

25:20.241 --> 25:35.575
Then I was running out of time for 30 years in the Air Force, and I was offered an assignment to Davis-Monthan in Tucson as a deputy for intelligence in the Tactical Air Control Wing there.

25:36.061 --> 25:39.225
we had a blast in Tucson for the last two years.

25:39.525 --> 25:45.493
Right, and then finally back to Texas A&M where you came to work for General Darling, right?

25:45.513 --> 26:04.718
Yes, after I retired in Tucson, I realized that I still like to eat and I needed a job, so I was asking around and fortunately found out a job came available here or was coming available and General Darling agreed to talk with me and he

26:05.120 --> 26:07.043
let me have the job.

26:07.063 --> 26:13.012
So I worked with the Corps of Cadets for about seven years.

26:14.374 --> 26:23.668
Then moved from the Corps over to being the safety officer for the physical plant operation.

26:24.577 --> 26:26.079
Had a great time doing that too.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.441
It's hard to say.

26:27.461 --> 26:34.471
I worked with about the same age person, male and female, over in the physical plant.

26:35.733 --> 26:41.942
There were a bunch of older, but about the same age with a number of them as I had worked with in the Corps.

26:42.743 --> 26:47.310
And they were a great bunch of people, as were the cadets.

26:47.662 --> 26:52.011
It was indeed a wonderful career, and we could go on and on, but we are out of time.

26:52.031 --> 26:58.866
You and your wife, Joni, have been married for some 47 years this summer, and we've talked about your kids, and a great career.

26:58.966 --> 27:01.111
We thank you for your service, and thank you for being here.

27:01.572 --> 27:03.055
Thank you very much, Tom.

27:03.524 --> 27:25.465
