country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin Family Community Bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:08.262 --> 00:17.970
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision-making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
[Music.]

00:48.355 --> 00:50.344
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:50.365 --> 00:52.568
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:52.588 --> 00:59.518
Jack Currie is an Aggie, but before he ever entered A&M, there was a war to fight in World War II's European theater.

00:59.887 --> 01:11.724
And that's where he and his B-17 crew flew some 50 combat missions in 1944 and 1945, a time in our history that included D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, and the eventual victory in Europe.

01:12.325 --> 01:26.104
He has some interesting stories to tell, but none more compelling than that mission on May the 12th, 1944, when his flying fortress was shot up so badly, it really had no business staying aloft, but it did.

01:26.124 --> 01:28.948
And thus, Jack Currie is here to tell that story and many more.

01:29.232 --> 01:33.617
Please welcome Air Force Major Jack Currie to Veterans of the Valley.

01:34.278 --> 01:38.923
Jack, it's a pleasure to have you here on Veterans of the Valley, and thank you for your service.

01:38.943 --> 01:48.935
You told me you grew up in Lot, Texas, and you said that like so many people who were in the Army Air Corps, you kind of got your attraction to flying as a child, watching the planes fly over.

01:49.195 --> 01:53.000
That's kind of how a lot of people got attracted to the Army Air Corps that way.

01:53.020 --> 01:53.901
You included, right?

01:54.221 --> 01:54.902
That's correct.

01:56.047 --> 02:03.794
Talk a little bit about your youth growing up in Lott and sort of how that led to your military career.

02:03.814 --> 02:05.555
You actually entered the military.

02:05.575 --> 02:09.719
You wanted to go to A&M, but you actually entered the military before you even entered A&M, right?

02:09.759 --> 02:12.922
Sort of talk about your youth leading up to the military.

02:12.942 --> 02:24.332
Well, as I said, I grew up in Lott, Texas, graduated from Lott High School, and I had aspirations of being

02:24.818 --> 02:28.463
A mechanic, at least, if not a flyer.

02:29.725 --> 02:35.874
And I took lessons as a diesel mechanic.

02:37.256 --> 02:44.146
And I decided to get experience.

02:44.346 --> 02:50.775
Everywhere I went after I got out of the diesel business, they wanted to know what experience I had.

02:51.059 --> 02:54.545
So I figured the only place I could get experience would be the Air Force.

02:54.565 --> 02:55.066
Right.

02:55.086 --> 02:58.111
So I enlisted at Randolph Air Force Base.

02:58.451 --> 02:59.874
In 1940, you did.

02:59.974 --> 03:07.386
Actually, before America got, the United States got involved in the war, you were involved.

03:07.407 --> 03:09.490
You went to Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois.

03:10.094 --> 03:15.661
And it's kind of ironic, your career almost ended there, too, actually, in Illinois also.

03:15.682 --> 03:25.174
But in between, a lot of places, Shepherd Air Force Base, you spent three years there, put in as an aviation cadet, you were accepted there, and then you went to basic in Uvalde, right?

03:25.375 --> 03:26.216
That's correct.

03:26.256 --> 03:26.416
Right.

03:27.017 --> 03:30.942
And eventually, just all over the place before you finally got to Europe.

03:31.002 --> 03:37.671
Goodfellow Air Force Base, Lubbock Airfield, graduated from flight school and went into

03:37.870 --> 03:38.831
multi-engine school.

03:38.871 --> 03:39.732
Why multi-engine?

03:39.752 --> 03:41.774
Why did that attract you?

03:43.015 --> 03:47.920
Well, I like the safety of more than one engine, let's put it that way.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.002
And that turned out to be a good thing, right?

03:50.022 --> 03:54.626
Because we're going to talk a lot about when you lost a couple of engines.

03:55.247 --> 03:58.390
Rattlesnake Bomber Base, that's where you did some of your training also.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.153
I had not been familiar with Rattlesnake Bomber Base.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.675
That's down somewhere between San Antonio and Moreno, right?

04:05.208 --> 04:05.789
Right?

04:05.809 --> 04:06.510
Right.

04:06.690 --> 04:07.871
Monahans, Texas.

04:07.891 --> 04:09.073
In Monahans.

04:09.093 --> 04:11.596
Alexandria, Louisiana for advanced B-17.

04:11.656 --> 04:13.298
You finally went to England in 1944.

04:13.359 --> 04:18.625
Talk about what your job was there as a member of a B-17 crew.

04:18.685 --> 04:19.847
What did you all do?

04:20.688 --> 04:33.004
Well, I went over as a co-pilot and stayed co-pilot until right at the last of my missions before I got promoted to a

04:33.288 --> 04:35.331
second lieutenant, uh, first lieutenant.

04:35.351 --> 04:36.272
Right.

04:36.292 --> 04:46.184
And, uh, well, that's about the way everybody did, you know, and if they, uh, lucky enough to complete the missions, they, they got promoted.

04:46.404 --> 04:47.545
Exactly, exactly.

04:48.066 --> 04:57.678
And, uh, I guess everybody looked forward to the, finishing their, their tour so they could come home.

04:57.978 --> 04:58.979
Right.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.704
You were, you remember the 8th Air Force 499th Squadron and,

05:03.038 --> 05:06.963
One of your jobs was actually a job to drop leaflets.

05:06.983 --> 05:07.563
Is that right?

05:07.623 --> 05:09.486
That's correct.

05:09.606 --> 05:10.687
Talk about that.

05:11.388 --> 05:18.676
These were obviously a propaganda type of leaflets to try to convince the enemy, to try to sway the enemy one way or the other.

05:19.117 --> 05:19.778
That's correct.

05:19.858 --> 05:28.368
And we carried everything from baseball scores in the United States to you name it.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.893
And we kept the Germans

05:33.869 --> 05:39.075
involved as well as the occupied people.

05:39.416 --> 05:39.696
Indeed.

05:40.717 --> 05:48.987
You told me one time that before D-Day, I guess, you actually dropped leaflets to tell the French to get out of the way.

05:49.007 --> 05:49.267
Right.

05:49.428 --> 05:49.688
Right?

05:50.369 --> 05:57.137
We went over the night before D-Day and dropped leaflets to the French.

05:57.497 --> 06:00.681
Told them to get out of the... Get off the beaches.

06:00.701 --> 06:01.762
Shearburg area there.

06:02.043 --> 06:02.323
Right.

06:02.607 --> 06:02.988
Right.

06:03.228 --> 06:23.296
And then I say we went back then the day after D-Day and began dropping more leaflets to keep people informed as to what the United States was doing, or the Allies, I should say.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.640
What do you remember about that, the day after D-Day?

06:25.660 --> 06:29.365
I mean, looking down, describe what you saw.

06:30.347 --> 06:30.707
Well,

06:31.733 --> 06:38.161
And going across the English Channel, I think a guy could have walked across almost on boats.

06:38.241 --> 06:41.264
I never saw so many boats or ships going across the channel.

06:42.586 --> 06:48.533
And they, of course, were landing on the beachhead.

06:49.013 --> 06:49.974
Right.

06:49.995 --> 07:00.627
Fortunately, we were up in the air and didn't catch any of the bullets or anything that were the poor people on the ground caught.

07:01.552 --> 07:05.237
Did you have a sense when you were doing this or did you even have time to think about it?

07:05.277 --> 07:15.812
Did you have a sense that you were witnessing history, that you were witnessing something that would be such a prominent part of history 60 years later?

07:15.832 --> 07:16.653
Not really.

07:16.673 --> 07:16.933
Right.

07:19.056 --> 07:21.159
Excuse me.

07:21.179 --> 07:31.153
I think as I look back on it, it was a part of history and I lived through that part of history.

07:32.635 --> 07:33.716
Glad that I did.

07:34.477 --> 07:41.824
You were based in England, your whole tour, the first half of your tour at Cheddington, which was, or excuse me, Chelveston.

07:41.844 --> 07:42.324
Chelveston.

07:42.344 --> 07:46.408
The first part of your tour, and the second part of your tour, Cheddington, is outside London.

07:46.588 --> 07:46.708
Right.

07:46.728 --> 07:51.613
And Cheddington, that was to be so that you could be close to Eisenhower headquarters.

07:51.693 --> 07:52.153
Is that right?

07:52.173 --> 07:54.676
That's correct.

07:54.696 --> 08:00.081
Let's go ahead and get to, you had many, 50 missions, 50 combat missions that you flew.

08:00.101 --> 08:00.381
That's right.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.996
and some were more exciting than others.

08:03.798 --> 08:04.318
Absolutely.

08:04.338 --> 08:09.086
I want to talk about May the 12th, 1944 and that mission.

08:09.827 --> 08:13.052
Talk a little bit about what the mission was about and what happened.

08:14.154 --> 08:19.101
Well, the mission was to go up to the northern end of Denmark.

08:19.642 --> 08:28.596
In fact, we crossed Denmark into the North Sea and were headed home and thought we were

08:29.825 --> 08:36.711
Free, of course, of enemy mission or enemy aircraft.

08:36.932 --> 08:37.612
Right.

08:38.133 --> 08:43.858
I want to interrupt you because there's one thing that I left out, that your particular unit, you were a night flying unit.

08:43.978 --> 08:44.759
That's right.

08:44.779 --> 08:50.144
So what you're describing right now happens at night, about between midnight and 2 a.m.

08:50.164 --> 08:50.604
in the morning.

08:50.624 --> 08:53.968
So we're talking pitch black so people can get a sense of what we're talking about.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.149
I'm sorry, go ahead.

08:55.949 --> 08:58.752
Well, I say we had left the coast of Denmark

08:59.963 --> 09:13.956
headed back toward England, and a couple of German Ju-88s who were equipped with radar slipped up behind us.

09:13.976 --> 09:16.338
Of course, we couldn't see them.

09:16.358 --> 09:27.928
And the first guy turned loose with .303s and .50 caliber.

09:29.360 --> 09:39.210
He really disabled our airplane because he hit number two engine and caused it to die, of course.

09:39.230 --> 09:44.776
And he shot out all the oxygen in the airplane.

09:44.896 --> 09:50.402
And they shot out all the navigational instruments.

09:52.324 --> 09:58.050
So because of the shortage of oxygen, we had to

09:58.942 --> 10:01.786
descend rather rapidly.

10:01.806 --> 10:02.027
Right.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.050
This happened you were at about 44,000 feet.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.734
No, we weren't that high, 24,000 feet.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.757
About 24,000 feet, excuse me.

10:08.777 --> 10:19.032
And we didn't know how well the airplane was going to fly with three engines.

10:19.393 --> 10:25.282
We did get the propeller feathered and thought we were in pretty good shape.

10:26.243 --> 10:27.345
But on the way down,

10:28.523 --> 10:31.666
the number four engine went out.

10:32.127 --> 10:34.970
Yeah, number four engine went out.

10:34.990 --> 10:36.171
And we got it feathered.

10:37.052 --> 10:40.015
So we were flying on two engines.

10:40.035 --> 10:48.564
But with the weight and so forth, we couldn't hold altitude.

10:49.585 --> 10:57.653
So we just gradually descended until we thought we were going to go into the English Channel, or the North Sea.

10:57.886 --> 11:07.477
Now you're piloting now because didn't you tell me that your pilot, Lieutenant Michaels, had actually gone to the back to check on some of the rest of the crew.

11:07.777 --> 11:10.440
And sadly, two of the crew were killed in the attack.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.623
Your waste gunners were killed in the attack.

11:12.663 --> 11:14.184
So he had gone back to check on them.

11:14.765 --> 11:17.208
And he said, take over.

11:18.009 --> 11:19.210
He says, you got it.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.613
You're flying the airplane now.

11:21.633 --> 11:25.497
So like I say, on the way down, we tried to get rid of,

11:26.708 --> 11:35.798
Well, let's go back and say we had a second JU-88 behind us, behind the first one.

11:35.818 --> 11:44.068
And the tail gunner and top turret gunner and waste gunner and everybody else was looking for this guy.

11:45.429 --> 11:48.813
And he blew up.

11:50.575 --> 11:56.462
And we thought, sure, the first guy would come back and get us.

11:56.678 --> 12:01.944
We never did see him anymore, so I don't know whether he got afraid and went back home or what happened.

12:01.964 --> 12:04.187
But anyway, we were glad.

12:05.068 --> 12:15.580
But we threw out everything in the airplane to lessen the weight and everything that we could cut loose.

12:17.102 --> 12:23.350
And we got down to about 3,500 feet before we began holding altitude.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.352
Right.

12:26.395 --> 12:32.103
what we thought was due west and we could hit the coast of England somewhere.

12:33.185 --> 12:37.931
But it seemed like we flew over hours and we didn't see a thing.

12:38.392 --> 12:42.538
You told me your compass had been destroyed.

12:42.698 --> 12:42.959
Right.

12:43.139 --> 12:45.803
So the only thing you had was just a little liquid compass.

12:45.823 --> 12:46.303
That's right.

12:46.363 --> 12:49.147
Like you see on an automobile.

12:49.348 --> 12:50.489
Exactly.

12:50.509 --> 12:51.811
Not the most trustworthy thing.

12:51.991 --> 12:55.997
Not very trustworthy, especially if they hadn't been

12:58.272 --> 13:00.715
Swung, I guess is the word is.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.777
Right.

13:01.837 --> 13:04.280
Correctly.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.463
So you were just trusting that you were heading to England.

13:06.503 --> 13:07.103
Right.

13:07.123 --> 13:09.026
Because this is pitch black, but you're not sure.

13:09.466 --> 13:19.379
And you also had a horizon problem, too, because of the unit that had been knocked out also, as far as what the horizon was.

13:19.399 --> 13:19.479
Yes.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.382
I didn't so much were on vacuum.

13:21.402 --> 13:23.925
And the vacuum pump that...

13:24.614 --> 13:29.641
did the artificial horizon and so forth, was on engine two.

13:30.903 --> 13:43.400
And of course, after the engine was disabled, the vacuum wasn't disabled.

13:43.640 --> 13:49.448
And we didn't realize what was happening.

13:50.069 --> 13:52.993
Everything was pretty cloudy at the moment.

13:53.013 --> 13:54.435
Sure.

13:57.115 --> 14:14.030
Finally, I remembered that we had an auxiliary vacuum pump on number three engine, so I switched over to number three, and the things began to straighten up, you know, the artificial rising and everything began to straighten up a little bit.

14:15.011 --> 14:25.941
But we flew for, it seemed like a lifetime, and nothing appeared

14:27.035 --> 14:27.756
in front of us.

14:28.837 --> 14:35.005
And finally, I told the navigator, I said, go down and check and see if any of your equipment works.

14:35.907 --> 14:52.668
And he came back and he said, if my navigation equipment was not damaged, he said, you better make a turn to the right about 90 degrees.

14:52.688 --> 14:55.472
So I did, and we almost immediately

14:56.414 --> 14:58.904
were picked up by the searchlights in England.

15:00.270 --> 15:06.677
And the searchlights led the way to

15:07.045 --> 15:10.109
supposedly a safe landing spot.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.651
Exactly.

15:12.032 --> 15:14.675
Getting a sense of this, again, 2 a.m.

15:14.716 --> 15:25.210
in the morning, it's pitch black, and you've got to trust this reading that says go 90 degrees to the right because you haven't hit land yet.

15:25.230 --> 15:28.935
And it turns out what you're doing is you're flying up the English Channel.

15:29.033 --> 15:29.393
Right.

15:29.634 --> 15:35.621
And if you had said, no, we're not going to turn right, we're going to keep on, you would have just been out towards the Atlantic Ocean.

15:35.641 --> 15:36.281
That's correct.

15:36.442 --> 15:36.682
Right.

15:36.902 --> 15:41.828
So you made the decision to do the 90-degree turn right, and you immediately picked up the searchlights.

15:42.028 --> 15:42.188
Right.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.292
How long after that before you were able to land?

15:45.332 --> 15:47.394
You didn't land, actually, until you got to Scotland, right?

15:47.414 --> 15:47.855
Oh, no.

15:48.115 --> 15:53.581
We flew all the way up the east coast of England, and I thought they never were going to let us land.

15:53.621 --> 15:57.606
But, you know, they finally did...

15:58.598 --> 16:03.303
give us a clearance to land by a green light, you know.

16:03.403 --> 16:03.703
Right.

16:03.723 --> 16:04.724
Now, you're on two engines.

16:05.305 --> 16:08.408
You had finally got it up to about 12,000 feet.

16:08.869 --> 16:09.369
Is that right?

16:10.110 --> 16:11.091
Is that what you're, the altitude?

16:11.111 --> 16:11.752
Well, we leveled off.

16:11.772 --> 16:25.727
I tried to level off at 12,000 feet, but I say in order to hold altitude, we had, we were almost at stalling speed, about 100 miles an hour, which is a minimum amount of B-17.

16:26.067 --> 16:26.968
Right, right.

16:27.303 --> 16:28.965
So eventually you did get to land.

16:28.986 --> 16:31.910
But I say it, we got down to about 3,500 feet.

16:32.010 --> 16:33.833
About 3,500 feet.

16:33.853 --> 16:41.765
And flew at 3,500 feet, just above stalling speed until we were able to land.

16:42.826 --> 16:48.835
Were you too busy doing your job to be scared, or were you scared?

16:48.855 --> 16:52.982
Well, I guess everybody was a little scared, but sure.

16:53.002 --> 16:54.123
Let me tell you, I was busy.

16:54.504 --> 16:55.926
Yeah, yeah.

16:56.750 --> 17:03.603
And because the pilot never did come back, he went back in the back of the airplane and said, you got it.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.187
And so I was in charge.

17:06.668 --> 17:07.891
So you were the man.

17:08.371 --> 17:09.594
You eventually did get to land.

17:09.614 --> 17:19.011
I think this is a good time to stop and let's look at some pictures because I wanted you to tell that story before we look at the pictures because we've got some photographs of that airplane.

17:19.801 --> 17:23.566
eventually it was just pushed overboard, right, because it couldn't fly anymore.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.830
But we've got some pictures of that airplane and some other pictures.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.914
Let's go ahead and go to some photographs that we've got right now.

17:29.775 --> 17:35.984
First off, we have a picture of a B-17 so that people can just sort of get an idea of what we're talking about.

17:36.004 --> 17:41.813
That's the Flying Fortress, a very high profile and recognizable airplane of World War II.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.156
A great airplane.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.538
Not as big inside

17:46.058 --> 17:52.370
It looks like a big airplane, and it is on the outside, but you get inside that thing, there's not a lot of room to move around, is there?

17:52.751 --> 17:59.964
That's correct, especially with the Bomb May that's big enough to hold 10, 100-pound bombs.

18:00.004 --> 18:00.265
Right.

18:00.425 --> 18:07.358
They landed the B-17 out at Easterwood a couple of years ago, and I got to get in one, and I thought, this is no place to spend a war.

18:08.468 --> 18:09.229
Okay, let's move on.

18:09.670 --> 18:10.251
I've got a map.

18:10.291 --> 18:17.283
This is from Google Earth, and this gives you an idea of what happened to Major Currie's crew.

18:17.964 --> 18:32.569
If you see Denmark up on the right side, up on the top part of the picture, that's Denmark, and you were flying this mission actually through Denmark, and you were hit just on the left coast or the west coast of Denmark, and that's where you were attacked.

18:33.393 --> 18:56.587
So if you can imagine flying with two engines completely across the North Sea down, I guess you were flying sort of in a direction of Southwest towards England, but you were actually going towards the English Channel and not knowing exactly where you were, thinking you were flying right into England, but you were actually still over water.

18:56.607 --> 19:00.953
And finally crossing there into the English Channel

19:01.945 --> 19:06.814
And I guess it was at about Dover when you made your 90-degree turn, is that right?

19:06.834 --> 19:07.095
That's right.

19:08.878 --> 19:15.511
Of course, Dover is a spot right there that you can see right there at the English Channel.

19:15.531 --> 19:23.506
And then had to fly essentially all the way over to England, over to the west side of England where Scotland is before you were able to land.

19:23.526 --> 19:23.827
That's correct.

19:23.847 --> 19:24.949
So looking at that map,

19:26.060 --> 19:33.252
You flew, about how, from the time you were hit to the time you were landed, do you remember about how long a time was that?

19:33.312 --> 19:35.315
How many hours was that, about?

19:35.936 --> 19:36.878
About three hours.

19:37.058 --> 19:39.582
About three hours.

19:39.602 --> 19:41.405
No wonder you were busy.

19:41.425 --> 19:42.787
No wonder you were busy.

19:42.807 --> 19:47.195
Anyway, I want to give people a sense of exactly how long this ordeal was.

19:47.756 --> 19:51.662
Let's move on to the next picture, and this is your crew, and...

19:52.283 --> 19:56.307
You told me that you're the only survivor of this picture.

19:56.327 --> 19:56.987
That's correct.

19:57.107 --> 19:59.649
All the rest of them passed away.

20:00.070 --> 20:02.832
And you were standing in the back, the second from the right?

20:02.852 --> 20:03.773
That's correct.

20:06.215 --> 20:08.417
Good-looking crew of airmen there.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.881
And that's one of the planes that you flew.

20:12.901 --> 20:14.282
Now, that doesn't look like a B-17.

20:14.302 --> 20:15.904
That's a two-engine.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.266
I don't know what type of aircraft that is.

20:18.286 --> 20:19.086
No, that's a B-17.

20:19.106 --> 20:20.007
Is that a B-17?

20:20.207 --> 20:21.008
Okay, okay.

20:21.578 --> 20:24.461
I had lost track of the propellers there.

20:25.982 --> 20:26.663
OK, let's move on.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.747
This is from a book that we have written by Pat Carty.

20:31.668 --> 20:34.571
And this is your airplane that was shot up.

20:34.591 --> 20:43.340
And you can see in the top photograph the flap that has been severely damaged.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.343
That's where the main damage was, right behind number two engine.

20:46.463 --> 20:47.704
Right behind number two engine.

20:48.663 --> 20:49.604
Right there at the flap.

20:49.624 --> 20:55.850
And in the bottom picture, you can see the fuselage, which has been heavily, heavily damaged.

20:55.870 --> 21:06.941
Unfortunately, we had two waste gunners were killed, and the radio man was hit once, and the tail gunner was hit twice.

21:07.742 --> 21:10.305
The ball turret gunner was hit three times.

21:11.366 --> 21:12.967
But they all survived.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.472
But you did lose two of your crew.

21:17.806 --> 21:19.968
That's right, we lost the two waist gunners.

21:19.988 --> 21:20.609
Two waist gunners.

21:22.851 --> 21:23.512
Okay, let's move on.

21:23.772 --> 21:27.135
This is a sample of the kind of leaflets that you dropped.

21:27.155 --> 21:43.611
It's obviously in German, and I don't know, my German is non-existent, and yours is not that good, so we don't know exactly what this leaflet is saying, but that's just sort of a sample of the kind of leaflet that you were dropping right there.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.428
Great photographs.

21:46.588 --> 21:49.070
Talk about the landing in Scotland.

21:49.090 --> 21:52.773
I don't want to get away without talking about that because that was quite exciting too, right?

21:52.793 --> 22:04.303
The landing itself was, talk a little bit about that because you didn't know it, but actually your tail, your tail prop had been shot out also.

22:04.323 --> 22:04.603
Right.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.586
So you didn't know what kind of landing it was going to be, but it turned out to be pretty rough, right?

22:09.327 --> 22:15.572
Well, the ball turret guns were left pointing straight down, so we knew they were going to

22:16.092 --> 22:17.614
They were the first things that hit.

22:18.075 --> 22:26.607
And we landed on PSP planking, which is steel planking with holes in it.

22:26.627 --> 22:39.045
Some people might be familiar with this, but they used it for runways, particularly in real wet areas where fighter planes.

22:39.565 --> 22:41.607
were landing.

22:43.429 --> 22:52.138
And it was kind of risky business to land a B-17 on a PSP planking.

22:52.158 --> 23:01.088
But we managed to land as quick as we could get to the edge of the airfield.

23:01.949 --> 23:02.830
I imagine, yes.

23:02.850 --> 23:07.935
And then it sounded like the airplane was falling apart.

23:08.793 --> 23:12.317
We knew the gun barrels were going to get bent on the ball turret.

23:12.758 --> 23:13.038
Right.

23:13.940 --> 23:16.543
But we didn't know the tail wheel had been shot off.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.304
Right.

23:17.324 --> 23:21.649
So what we really landed on was the tail and the ball turret.

23:23.171 --> 23:28.758
And the next day, when it was daylight, that was when you actually got a chance to first go out and get a look at your airplane.

23:28.778 --> 23:32.643
And when you looked at it, you thought you had no idea how you were able to get back.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.124
Is that right?

23:33.144 --> 23:33.745
That's right.

23:34.486 --> 23:35.827
The props had holes in it.

23:35.867 --> 23:37.129
Right.

23:38.510 --> 23:48.887
cylinders on the engine had the fans knocked off and we wondered how that engines kept running, but they did.

23:48.907 --> 23:50.490
Indeed.

23:50.990 --> 24:01.868
Whenever I've talked to flyers, they've always told me that the things that they feared the most in the order would be the enemy would be third.

24:02.624 --> 24:05.688
Second would be mechanical problems, and first would always be weather.

24:05.708 --> 24:08.452
That was the thing that concerned them the most, is the kind of weather.

24:08.472 --> 24:11.997
And you influenced some pretty dicey weather in your 50 missions, right?

24:12.017 --> 24:20.129
We certainly did, because on two particular missions, we took off, and they told us there'd be no place in England to land when we got back.

24:20.149 --> 24:24.135
This kind of makes you think, you know, before you take off.

24:24.155 --> 24:24.715
That's right.

24:25.196 --> 24:30.724
But on one mission, we finally did land up in Scotland,

24:30.704 --> 24:42.362
And another mission, we landed down on the very south end at a naval base in England.

24:42.382 --> 24:46.768
So we made it back safely on both of those missions.

24:47.810 --> 24:50.334
We're starting to run out of time, and there's so much more to tell.

24:50.374 --> 24:57.825
Of course, you did fly 50 missions, but I want to go ahead and get you home because you had such a career.

24:58.177 --> 25:00.280
after you came home.

25:00.340 --> 25:08.872
Sort of talk a little bit after you finally got home, and I know that you got out, but then you got back in again, and then you had a career at Texas A&M also.

25:08.892 --> 25:14.840
So sort of wrap up a little bit after you got home and sort of take us to your retirement in 1962.

25:14.940 --> 25:20.047
Well, I got out because I had enough points to get out.

25:20.748 --> 25:26.496
They were about to send me to B-24 to fly, I mean, B-24.

25:27.590 --> 25:33.276
B-29s to fly out of the South Seas.

25:33.796 --> 25:37.700
And I told them, well, I had enough combat that I believe I'd just get out.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.422
And so I did.

25:41.444 --> 25:45.728
I say I worked for the VA for a while.

25:45.828 --> 25:55.538
And then when Castro acted up, I got recalled.

25:57.340 --> 26:08.493
I went into SA-16, which is a flying boat for rescue.

26:09.474 --> 26:26.453
And I stayed in the rescue outfit for a couple of three years and flew from Japanese airfields, mostly, into South Korea.

26:27.293 --> 26:37.483
and down to Iwo Jima, wherever we might need to escort an airplane that was... Right.

26:37.503 --> 26:43.930
I know your career took you to Guam where you helped clean up after a typhoon that was in Guam.

26:43.950 --> 26:55.782
And eventually your career, I said 1962, you actually finally retired in 1982 actually, an 18 year career in procurement here at Texas A&M.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.170
And quite a career.

26:58.653 --> 27:07.929
Colonel Currie, we're out of time, but I want to thank you very much for your service and thank you for telling the story and glad you made it back.

27:07.949 --> 27:08.450
I am too.

27:08.650 --> 27:09.492
I know that you are.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.874
Thank you very much for your service.

27:11.195 --> 27:11.796
Thank you.

27:12.164 --> 27:16.751
Through the grace of God, Jack Currie lived to tell about that flight in May of 1944.

27:17.492 --> 27:25.223
He and his wife, Ruth, have been married for 66 years, and our thoughts are with her and Jack's family as she battles Alzheimer's disease.

27:25.824 --> 27:36.500
Jack and Ruth have three children, several grandchildren, even great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren, all of whom have reason to forever be proud of this airman of World War II.

27:36.580 --> 27:40.045
We salute Jack Currie for his service and salute all veterans.

27:40.582 --> 27:41.875
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:41.895 --> 27:43.875
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:44.000 --> 00:48.000
