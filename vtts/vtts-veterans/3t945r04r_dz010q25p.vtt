00:30.544 --> 00:34.824
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.844 --> 00:35.826
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.062
There are certain dates that define history.

00:39.082 --> 00:42.506
June the 6th, 1944 is certainly one, D-Day.

00:43.347 --> 00:52.456
The Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, in what Hollywood would aptly call the longest day, the beginning of the end of World War II.

00:53.477 --> 01:03.467
Some 29,000 Americans died during the invasion, another 106,000 wounded or missing, and today there are a few still alive to tell their story.

01:03.920 --> 01:10.530
of how they made a stand at the beaches called Juneau, Gold, Sword, Omaha, and Utah.

01:11.151 --> 01:15.918
It was that day at Utah Beach that 23-year-old tank commander George Cox Jr.

01:16.318 --> 01:22.167
of the 746th Battalion shared the horror of war and stared it straight in the eye.

01:22.788 --> 01:33.724
Today, he and his wife, Leona, live in their rural home just north of Caldwell, where he proudly recounts those final months of the war, where he earned

01:34.075 --> 01:41.365
his Purple Heart, and special recognition as a player in five major battles, including the Battle of the Bulge.

01:42.447 --> 01:45.671
It's an honor to have you, Sergeant Cox, here with us today.

01:46.312 --> 01:50.418
Sergeant Cox, talk a little bit about leading up to D-Day.

01:51.299 --> 01:58.369
Your battalion was actually quarantined in the south part of England near the English Channel, getting ready to go.

01:58.469 --> 01:59.992
Talk about that time.

02:00.052 --> 02:03.897
It was a very lonely time, but you learned about what your mission was going to be.

02:04.113 --> 02:23.583
Yes, we was in the camp, and they give us maps of the place of France there, the peninsula, and we also had to waterproof our tanks for eight foot of water, and we just went about our duty of getting ready to go over there, and we weren't even allowed to talk to the cooks.

02:23.603 --> 02:26.087
They took our cooks away and brought in other cooks,

02:26.067 --> 02:32.575
And we weren't allowed to talk to anybody, nobody, except people in our tanks and our crew there.

02:32.595 --> 02:34.638
But you knew the significance of your mission.

02:34.738 --> 02:41.327
You were pretty well aware that, as you told me, this was a maneuver, this was a mission that you had to win.

02:41.367 --> 02:42.088
You could not lose it.

02:42.628 --> 02:44.991
There was going in and no coming back.

02:45.732 --> 02:52.201
We had to win because they couldn't do this over again like that, as big as it was.

02:52.221 --> 02:52.581
Right.

02:53.050 --> 03:02.204
Now, a lot of people who know their history books know that D-Day originally was supposed to be on June the 5th, the day before on a Sunday, but because of weather, they had to push it back a day.

03:02.264 --> 03:08.093
Eisenhower decided to push it back a day, and that kept you on a Higgins boat for quite a long time.

03:08.113 --> 03:08.854
Talk about that.

03:09.114 --> 03:16.345
We had five tanks and two Jeeps on the Higgins boat, and we loaded them on on a Thursday.

03:16.746 --> 03:18.248
I believe it was about...

03:19.409 --> 03:36.996
the second of June and we laid in harbor overnight and then we started out to go over to the beach because we were slower than some of the other vehicles and boats there and we just had a

03:38.950 --> 03:43.959
wait a while in order to get in line to get our place to land on the beach over there.

03:44.540 --> 03:55.761
And the waves were so big they was coming over the top of the boat and there was no place to sleep except setting up in the tank, no place to go to one restroom and 35 people there.

03:55.741 --> 03:58.004
on this little Higgins boat.

03:58.024 --> 04:04.731
And we fought that storm and didn't go very fast because of the waves are so big.

04:05.312 --> 04:12.040
And then they turned us around in the middle of the morning and in the middle of the next day while they turned us around and headed us back.

04:12.060 --> 04:16.705
Of course, it was dark the whole time raining and the whole time we was going over.

04:17.126 --> 04:24.955
And then, of course, when we hit the beach that day, the sun came out and there's all them ships around us and other soldiers were with us and landing on the beach.

04:25.627 --> 04:28.550
Five tanks on this Higgins boat, 36 men.

04:30.192 --> 04:36.318
You're on this boat for three days or more before you land at Utah Beach.

04:37.299 --> 04:39.061
What's the mood of these men?

04:39.101 --> 04:40.562
What do you talk about?

04:40.682 --> 04:42.704
How do you pass the time?

04:42.724 --> 04:46.188
We're trying to figure out some way to get us to sleep or something to eat.

04:47.289 --> 04:50.132
Of course, our adrenaline is high.

04:50.602 --> 04:57.089
We was waiting, and we didn't know what to be scared of, so we wasn't really scared because we didn't know what to be scared of.

04:57.109 --> 05:00.693
We were just going to land on the beach and go to fighting and go to shooting.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.095
That's all we figured it was going to be.

05:02.836 --> 05:03.817
Indeed.

05:03.837 --> 05:08.682
All right, let's go to that morning of June the 6th, and you take it from there.

05:09.603 --> 05:14.349
I know that when the Higgins boat landed, you were in a little bit deeper water than you had anticipated.

05:14.989 --> 05:17.993
Talk about your landing and talk about what happened from there.

05:18.053 --> 05:18.473
Go ahead.

05:18.593 --> 05:19.174
Tell your story.

05:19.745 --> 05:33.365
Well, we was due to come in at 7 o'clock that morning, but we run a little late coming in from there because there was other things that was needed because the beach wasn't that congested as the Omaha Beach.

05:33.385 --> 05:42.338
And our 4th Infantry Division that we were in reserve with moved on so fast that the beach was all cleared and they needed hospital tents.

05:42.358 --> 05:48.267
They put a hospital tent on there and operated on the soldiers there by the time we got there at 1130.

05:48.753 --> 06:08.618
and then we couldn't get across because they flooded the beach on each side of the road and we couldn't get down the road for the water because one half track got stuck and we had to find out what it was the captain did and they went up and pushed it off and then we could go on inland to try to help the troops.

06:09.340 --> 06:16.453
I want to back up and I'd like to show a picture if we can now of your battalion, the 700 and, or your platoon, part of your battalion.

06:17.175 --> 06:19.218
And there they are, there's men.

06:19.239 --> 06:23.006
Now this was taken before you actually went across the Atlantic.

06:23.026 --> 06:24.048
Where was this picture taken?

06:24.168 --> 06:29.478
In Alabama in 1943 in the summer there out of Dothan, Alabama.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.201
About a year before D-Day.

06:31.281 --> 06:32.884
About a year before D-Day.

06:32.864 --> 06:44.005
and if i was told right by you and your wife excuse my pen here i'm going to point i believe that uh this is you right here in the second row bending over yes right there right there so uh

06:45.200 --> 06:46.681
Quite a close group, I guess, right?

06:47.102 --> 06:47.803
Yes, sir.

06:49.084 --> 06:53.368
More was close with the five men in your tank because you were separated from the rest of the men.

06:53.428 --> 06:56.331
You didn't get to see them till after dark at night.

06:57.712 --> 07:03.538
Most of the time, you was in the tank, moving around, trying to find a place to fight or going to some place to fight.

07:03.638 --> 07:08.042
And we spent a lot of time standing up and sitting down in the tank.

07:08.442 --> 07:09.303
Indeed, indeed.

07:09.884 --> 07:14.228
Now, I want to go back to the landing at Utah Beach.

07:15.068 --> 07:19.653
Describe, if you will, what we know what beaches look like today.

07:20.294 --> 07:22.316
Is it very similar to what it looked like today?

07:22.337 --> 07:23.057
What kind of beach?

07:23.157 --> 07:25.180
Is it a clean beach, white beach, dirty beach?

07:25.200 --> 07:25.660
What is it?

07:25.680 --> 07:31.427
It was clean, except it had a lot of obstacles in there, which you can see in the top picture there.

07:31.908 --> 07:32.008
Okay.

07:32.028 --> 07:37.614
Let's go ahead and go to a picture that specifically that I want to look at when we get it ready to go.

07:39.196 --> 07:40.738
This is going to be a...

07:41.242 --> 07:43.425
A photograph I've got, oh, here we go, coming up.

07:43.465 --> 07:45.127
It's this bottom picture that we're looking at.

07:46.048 --> 07:50.454
And this is your battalion, actually a landing, a photo that was taken.

07:50.814 --> 07:59.445
And you told me that you can't be for certain, but there's a possibility that this may be the Jeep that was following your tank.

07:59.465 --> 08:05.553
It possibly, there's about a one in nine chance that that was you, because I guess there were nine different platoons coming on the beach.

08:05.873 --> 08:09.578
But this is essentially what it was, right?

08:10.115 --> 08:10.576
Yes, sir.

08:10.676 --> 08:19.230
Each platoon had five tanks, and the last one coming off had a jeep tied behind them.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.256
And so it's hard to say whether that was me for sure or not.

08:22.776 --> 08:30.990
But I was in deeper water, and I had to go around the other tanks in order to get my drivers out of the water.

08:31.050 --> 08:34.617
They were standing up in the jeep, and I had to pull around to get them out of there.

08:35.077 --> 08:35.498
Indeed.

08:36.895 --> 08:47.390
And you talked about coming, you came out of the Higgins boat, you were actually in eight feet of water, and that was barely enough room for you to maneuver exactly to get back on the beach.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.353
Were you afraid that you were going to get stuck in the water?

08:49.733 --> 08:53.799
No, no, the tracks wouldn't settle in the sand.

08:53.879 --> 08:54.340
I see.

08:55.261 --> 08:59.848
That's the purpose of the track vehicles, because they could travel better in there.

09:00.149 --> 09:02.973
Now down the way, how much do these tanks weigh?

09:02.993 --> 09:03.734
32 tons?

09:03.774 --> 09:04.755
32 tons.

09:04.775 --> 09:05.496
32 tons.

09:05.557 --> 09:16.792
Now down the way at Omaha Beach, I understand that there were actually some of these tanks that had floatation devices around them designed to float, but a lot of times that didn't work in a lot of cases.

09:16.852 --> 09:23.642
It didn't float, and they lost over 50% of their tanks, the 70th Tank Battalion did, going in ahead of us.

09:25.184 --> 09:26.025
We didn't lose any.

09:26.306 --> 09:28.829
We got on our 54 tanks on the beach.

09:29.110 --> 09:29.430
Right.

09:30.878 --> 09:33.222
June the 6th, that day, you land on the beach.

09:34.023 --> 09:45.500
You're waiting, as I remember, because there's a little bit of confusion as far as what outfit, whether it was the 101st or the 82nd, that you were going to be in support of before you actually got your orders on the beach.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.061
Is that right?

09:46.201 --> 09:46.962
That's right.

09:46.982 --> 09:48.544
Talk a little bit about that.

09:48.564 --> 09:52.971
We went on in the beach that day and the first day.

09:52.951 --> 09:55.016
We didn't encounter the enemy, really.

09:55.356 --> 09:59.606
We stayed overnight, and it was the next day that we had orders to go to St.

09:59.626 --> 10:09.087
Ameriglis to fight with the 101st Airborne, and before we got there, we run into the 82nd Airborne pinned down with German SS paratroopers.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.892
That was supposed to be some of their best soldiers, their SS paratroopers.

10:13.132 --> 10:19.200
And all the tanks went through the town, and I was the last one coming through.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.583
And they asked me to help out.

10:22.004 --> 10:29.013
The captain commander told me to help out the battalion there of the 182nd Airborne there.

10:29.914 --> 10:30.855
And we run into...

10:31.628 --> 10:34.651
I got knocked out, and that's where I got wounded there.

10:35.412 --> 10:40.658
And there was about 100 soldiers surrendered to us at that time, German soldiers.

10:40.678 --> 10:45.523
So when you got on the beach, was there resistance initially when you came on the beach?

10:45.543 --> 10:47.205
No resistance for us on the beach.

10:47.586 --> 10:48.767
They already had pushed in.

10:49.368 --> 10:58.197
Omar Bradley was there on the beach trying to get things organized, and General Roosevelt died of a heart attack over there.

10:58.217 --> 11:00.640
And he...

11:01.143 --> 11:02.865
forced his way over there.

11:02.885 --> 11:07.350
They didn't want him to go in there, but he went, and he took charge of things on the beach there.

11:07.651 --> 11:11.014
You talk about General Bradley in sort of glowing terms, I can tell that.

11:11.055 --> 11:15.460
That's obviously a historical figure that you think a lot of.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.523
Yes, he was the commander of the 12th Army Group.

11:19.064 --> 11:23.769
He was over Patton, and he was over Hodges in there.

11:23.930 --> 11:26.973
He was over three or four armies.

11:27.313 --> 11:28.134
Right.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.357
And he was there on the beach that day to see

11:30.607 --> 11:32.510
that his men was doing what they supposed to.

11:32.850 --> 11:46.512
Okay, you get beyond the beach, and as you said, the Germans had really flooded the roads to try to stall the invasion, but you were able to get through that and actually get to the roads behind the beach, and that's when you went into the town of Verville.

11:46.532 --> 11:53.523
Take us from there, from the next day and leaving the beach, and really D plus one, which is the day that you suffered your wound.

11:53.763 --> 11:53.863
Yeah.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.484
Well, that's where we was at in Vereville.

11:56.844 --> 12:14.905
We got up that morning, they gave us orders to go down and the Saint-Dominguez was the objective, the main objective, it was to cut off the flow of Germans from Saint Lowe, from Paris on through to Cherbourg so they could capture that port so they could use it for bringing in supplies.

12:15.806 --> 12:22.213
And when we did, that's where we run into the Germans.

12:23.307 --> 12:32.389
Take us down that road as specifically as you can remember from 61 years ago.

12:32.774 --> 12:37.380
And the instance that you were wounded, I believe you said that your tank was hit five times.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.181
Is that right?

12:38.201 --> 12:38.501
Yes.

12:38.682 --> 12:50.417
Well, first coming into the little town, it was coming in from the east there, from the west, and coming into town, and there was a German in a woodpile, and he was shooting at us with a rifle.

12:50.477 --> 12:54.242
A bullet went down the side of my head, and I knew then that we was in war.

12:54.492 --> 13:01.982
And I told the boys to turn the gun around there and shoot the machine gun, and if that didn't stop him, we were going to shoot him with the big gun.

13:02.002 --> 13:08.852
Well, then evidently we got him with the machine gun because he didn't shoot at us no more, so we went on down the road.

13:08.872 --> 13:18.745
And there was a church there, and there was somebody in the church shooting down, a sniper shooting down on the soldiers, and I put the big gun to shoot up there, but he quit shooting.

13:18.978 --> 13:23.547
And we learned later that he got scared, and the Germans did, and laid down in there.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.089
And two days later, he surrendered.

13:25.991 --> 13:30.780
And we went on around by the church and turned left and went down behind the church on a road.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.064
And it was Germans all in the hedgerows in there.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.691
And we began to shoot at them, and they shoot back at us.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.775
And I was looking through a periscope.

13:39.262 --> 13:45.489
And they shot the top two inches out of the periscope and left part of it in my eye and part of it in my head there.

13:46.170 --> 13:49.814
And then they shot a shell through the tank.

13:49.834 --> 13:52.918
It knocked out my gunner and took off part of his head.

13:53.799 --> 14:02.910
And then there was three other boys in there and I told them back the tank up and they stalled the tank.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.712
And when they stalled the tank,

14:04.979 --> 14:11.169
I told them to knock the escape hatch out and get out and go to the left and join up with the paratroopers to fight.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.735
And a shell come in there and hit them and knocked all three of them out.

14:15.296 --> 14:23.830
And me being blind, I couldn't see them and I couldn't hear them, so they didn't answer me, so I jumped out of the tank and run with the paratroopers myself.

14:24.150 --> 14:25.673
So you assumed that they had perished?

14:25.893 --> 14:27.055
I assumed they were dead.

14:27.355 --> 14:27.696
Right.

14:28.064 --> 14:31.069
And when I came back, I found out all about them then.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.270
Indeed.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.554
And you were giving these orders and you couldn't see.

14:34.894 --> 14:35.455
I couldn't see.

14:35.515 --> 14:40.423
I tell them what to do and everything until they wouldn't answer me no more and I couldn't see them.

14:41.144 --> 14:41.925
And they came too.

14:41.945 --> 14:44.469
They tell me they came too and they run the tank.

14:44.569 --> 14:56.367
The boys tried the tank again and he got it started and he run through the down the road behind the Germans and they give each other first aid, got them bandaged up and then turned around and come back through them.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.770
And right after that, then the Germans surrendered.

14:59.692 --> 15:03.537
When you jumped out of the tank and you started running, you still couldn't see very well.

15:03.798 --> 15:04.359
Is that right?

15:04.739 --> 15:07.283
No, I could open my eyes and they would go shut back on me.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.286
I could only see for a few seconds.

15:10.007 --> 15:16.317
And the last I saw was I opened up and there was an American paratrooper there with an M1 rifle right at the end of my nose.

15:16.337 --> 15:17.579
He wanted to know if I was out of that tank.

15:17.619 --> 15:19.382
I told him, yeah, don't shoot, man.

15:19.422 --> 15:20.363
I'm an American.

15:20.731 --> 15:24.337
And then he told me to get in a ditch there, and I told him I couldn't see the ditch.

15:24.518 --> 15:30.248
He took me over and put me in it, and I crawled it up until I found some more American soldiers in there.

15:30.969 --> 15:37.099
And then the medics came, and I asked them to take me back, and they said they had a man on the litter.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.342
I said, well, I can walk.

15:38.382 --> 15:40.866
Let me have your belt, and I will follow you off.

15:40.846 --> 15:51.416
I held on the back of the medic who was carrying off a soldier, and they took me to the first aid station of the 101st Airborne and patched me up and then sent me back to England.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.843
How long were you out getting patched up?

15:54.683 --> 15:57.750
Well, I was out until June the 28th or 9th.

15:58.051 --> 16:00.196
Then I got back to my outfit.

16:00.336 --> 16:01.298
So about three weeks or so?

16:01.318 --> 16:04.285
About three, a little longer than about six weeks.

16:04.466 --> 16:04.827
Oh, okay.

16:05.228 --> 16:07.453
About six weeks it took me.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.578
Of course, I wasn't in the hospital that long.

16:09.598 --> 16:11.703
I was in the transit of getting back to my outfit.

16:11.723 --> 16:13.587
It took time to ship me back over there.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.971
And when we did, we came through right at St.

16:17.052 --> 16:17.372
Lowell.

16:17.752 --> 16:26.523
When they made the breakthrough there, there was the 4th and the 9th and the 79th Infantry Divisions pushed out past St.

16:26.563 --> 16:31.530
Lowell and made a breakthrough for Patton's Army then to turn him loose.

16:31.550 --> 16:31.830
Wow.

16:32.831 --> 16:37.257
But you came back after the six weeks that you were getting patched up and you were put right back into a tank.

16:37.337 --> 16:39.520
I was given another tank, another crew.

16:40.281 --> 16:43.725
And then we were in the gap there, the fluency gap there.

16:44.110 --> 16:45.072
Right.

16:45.312 --> 16:47.316
And we fought in it.

16:47.336 --> 16:49.260
That was one major battle there.

16:49.781 --> 16:51.164
You were in five major battles.

16:51.184 --> 16:51.445
Yes.

16:51.565 --> 16:53.729
I guess the last one was the Battle of the Bulge.

16:53.749 --> 16:54.010
Yes.

16:54.030 --> 16:59.781
So there were three between your initial battle in Verville and then the Battle of the Bulge, right?

17:00.282 --> 17:01.765
The last one was the Remargan.

17:01.905 --> 17:02.186
Okay.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.713
But we were in the Bulge and in the Remargan.

17:06.368 --> 17:08.652
and the beachhead, we was in all five of them.

17:08.832 --> 17:15.062
Talk about the Battle of the Bulge and where your platoon was actually situated or what your involvement was there.

17:15.483 --> 17:23.837
We just got through, and the other major one is the Argonne Forest, and we was in that with the 1st Army and the 9th Infantry Division.

17:24.205 --> 17:28.749
And we went from there to a rest area.

17:28.769 --> 17:32.152
And when the rest area was over, we was going back.

17:32.172 --> 17:33.633
Well, then that's when the bulge came.

17:33.673 --> 17:46.124
And they turned us around and took us back then to push up the bulge and hold in there to stop it out of Eupen, Belgium.

17:47.045 --> 17:51.849
A whole other element of your story which we're about to get to is what's just happened in the last couple of years.

17:52.009 --> 17:53.470
You returned to France.

17:53.973 --> 18:00.759
in 2003 and again just about a year ago for the 60th anniversary of D-Day in 2004.

18:01.980 --> 18:15.292
But a gentleman that I want to talk about is a young man who was actually seven years old on D-Day who you found out years later had remembered your platoon coming in, your tank, and you being wounded.

18:15.392 --> 18:16.593
Last name is Godard.

18:17.614 --> 18:22.478
Talk about him and then just the miracle of meeting up with him all those years later.

18:22.947 --> 18:30.899
Well, we went over there in 2003, and we had a tour guide we had hired, and he took us to the town.

18:30.979 --> 18:41.154
I said, well, I wanted to go to the little town where I was wounded, and we asked the lady if there was anybody still alive, and she said yes, and we encountered his son, and he said, wait, we want to get, Daddy wants to come back.

18:41.615 --> 18:51.790
And so we talked to him and talked about the war, and then he let us, told us that his mother put him in a hole in the chicken house and put ten over him,

18:51.938 --> 18:53.120
so he wouldn't get killed.

18:55.423 --> 18:57.907
And this was when he was seven years old?

18:57.927 --> 18:59.950
That was when he was seven years old.

18:59.970 --> 19:00.951
And he remembered it.

19:01.192 --> 19:05.378
He remembered it rather distinctly from seven years old.

19:05.398 --> 19:10.826
This must have just been incredible for you to meet up with this who was a youth back then.

19:10.846 --> 19:16.294
And I guess he was, what, about in his mid-60s, I guess.

19:16.575 --> 19:20.140
Something in the mid-60s in there.

19:20.288 --> 19:26.193
Well, one reason this man took to us, too, is when his brother got wounded.

19:26.213 --> 19:32.719
He was a civilian, and the 101st Airborne Medics took him in and tried to save his life.

19:32.739 --> 19:39.744
He didn't make it, but he was so impressed with what the Americans had did for him there for his brother trying to save his life.

19:39.764 --> 19:45.810
And he always wanted to have someone, Americans, and show his appreciation to have him for lunch there with him.

19:46.410 --> 19:49.873
So when we told him he was coming back last year, he invited us for lunch with him.

19:49.921 --> 19:50.702
Let's talk about that.

19:50.743 --> 20:01.222
June 6, 2004, you and your family and your wife and other members of your family return to Normandy and, in fact, to Veerville.

20:02.023 --> 20:08.014
And we've got some photographs that actually come off of a calendar that I believe was made for you, and I want to

20:08.264 --> 20:09.627
go to a couple of these pictures.

20:09.647 --> 20:10.709
Here's one right here.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.577
And talk about the three pictures that we are looking at.

20:14.617 --> 20:19.045
These were taken on the 60th anniversary.

20:19.065 --> 20:19.466
Is that right?

20:19.486 --> 20:23.113
Talk a little bit about the photographs, the one on the left.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.196
That is the mayor.

20:24.276 --> 20:27.943
That's the mayor of the town pinning a badge on me now on the left.

20:28.818 --> 20:36.970
And the one on the right bottom is two of the band of brothers that we met while we was over there.

20:37.791 --> 20:40.675
And they were out of the 101st Airborne, I believe.

20:41.797 --> 20:44.260
And I cannot see what the picture is.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.547
The one on the top, I think, is just a group of you just waiting for the ceremony to begin.

20:48.587 --> 20:51.811
Yeah, we were waiting for the ceremony for this mayor to pin this on us.

20:51.931 --> 20:53.434
To pin that on you.

20:53.454 --> 20:57.880
And as a matter of fact, that medal,

20:58.163 --> 21:02.068
I believe, or one just like it, is the one that you're wearing today.

21:02.148 --> 21:02.709
Is that right?

21:02.769 --> 21:11.399
That was the one that, as you can see, Sergeant Cox there, the medal there on the top is the one that he is wearing today.

21:11.420 --> 21:14.684
And it's a depiction of soldiers actually rushing the beach.

21:15.865 --> 21:18.508
And that's something that you've just got to be very, very proud of.

21:18.528 --> 21:19.490
I'm very proud of it.

21:19.610 --> 21:23.154
It had to be proved through the Pentagon for us to get it.

21:23.575 --> 21:27.900
And only the ones that went in on the beach there the first few days is entitled to it.

21:28.049 --> 21:34.199
And of course the very familiar metal there on the bottom left is the purple heart.

21:34.219 --> 21:39.969
Another one that you keep very close to your heart, right?

21:41.011 --> 21:44.877
Now talk about the other metal a little bit, because we talked about the five major battles.

21:45.380 --> 21:52.411
And talk about the other metal, and people probably can't see it because it's very small, but the star that is attached to that metal.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.774
There is a little bronze arrowhead on that metal.

21:54.794 --> 21:56.256
That's an ETO metal.

21:56.417 --> 22:00.543
And then they have the Pacific operations.

22:00.563 --> 22:04.269
And this ETO metal, all of us get it that was in there.

22:04.689 --> 22:07.894
And the ones that fought in the major battles would get a bronze star.

22:08.347 --> 22:11.512
arrowhead for coming in on the beachhead there.

22:12.293 --> 22:17.600
And then each major battle he was in, you get a bronze star up until you get the fifth one.

22:17.620 --> 22:18.942
Then they give you a silver star.

22:19.002 --> 22:24.590
So the little star I have is a silver star for five major battles.

22:24.610 --> 22:25.832
Again, you're very proud of that.

22:26.437 --> 22:36.619
We've got another photograph that I want to go to that is from this calendar, and there's three photographs on it that I want you to also talk about.

22:36.759 --> 22:43.735
One of them that we're going to be seeing is actually you with a, there we go, and we'll fix the glare on that.

22:44.396 --> 22:44.817
There we go.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.525
The one on the left, that's you and the mayor of Verville, is that right?

22:48.585 --> 22:49.827
That's the mayor of Verville.

22:50.267 --> 22:52.391
He come over for the lunch that day.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.133
We had lunch with the Frenchman.

22:54.594 --> 22:56.797
It took from 1.30 to 5.30 for lunch.

22:57.338 --> 23:05.891
And in pre-lunch there, while the busload of Germans come in, there was one or two soldiers that had surrendered to us there.

23:06.452 --> 23:12.581
And he had been there before, so they got him to come there while we was there so we could visit with him.

23:12.601 --> 23:13.943
That's in your top picture.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.986
and the bottom one... That just looks like your family.

23:19.026 --> 23:21.470
That's my family and his family.

23:21.711 --> 23:22.211
And your family.

23:22.532 --> 23:31.105
That top right picture, this was a busload of Germans who were there, excuse us, that were there for the ceremony.

23:31.473 --> 23:45.694
And you stood in Mr. Goddard's backyard and actually had a conversation talking about your experiences of 60 years ago with these veterans, German veterans, who had fought against you 60 years ago.

23:45.714 --> 23:48.158
That must have just been a surreal experience for you.

23:49.059 --> 23:50.501
It was very emotional.

23:50.521 --> 23:51.683
Yes, yes.

23:51.703 --> 23:53.245
And there.

23:55.233 --> 24:03.821
We had an interpreter that would take what I said and interpret them in German, and then he would take what the Frenchman said and then put it into German.

24:04.182 --> 24:05.968
He spoke all three languages.

24:06.185 --> 24:11.511
And we just had a marvelous time visiting there with the folks.

24:11.611 --> 24:19.119
And one of the soldiers, a German, said to me, I'm certainly glad we didn't kill you so we'd have a little while to visit with you.

24:19.579 --> 24:21.562
The feeling was likewise, I'm sure.

24:21.642 --> 24:24.525
I told him, I said, I am certainly glad you didn't kill me.

24:24.545 --> 24:25.806
I enjoyed visiting with you.

24:26.046 --> 24:30.892
Here's another photograph that we'd like to go to, again, from this special calendar that you have.

24:31.713 --> 24:35.837
The one on the left is actually you dining with the Godard family there.

24:36.290 --> 24:37.793
in his backyard, is that right?

24:37.973 --> 24:40.198
We was visiting with him just before lunch.

24:40.218 --> 24:41.681
They took us in the house for lunch.

24:41.701 --> 24:42.904
This is in his backyard.

24:45.389 --> 24:49.297
And just more photographs of that gathering from a year ago.

24:49.337 --> 24:51.261
That's some of the family inside there.

24:53.367 --> 24:53.988
Fascinating.

24:54.348 --> 24:55.389
Very, very fascinating.

24:55.409 --> 24:57.290
This is a trip that you'll never forget.

24:57.310 --> 25:03.576
Now, this summer, you're going to stay home, I understand, but then you're planning on another trip a year from now, and I guess in the summer of 2006.

25:03.756 --> 25:04.437
Is that right?

25:04.457 --> 25:05.377
You're going to go back?

25:05.417 --> 25:06.859
Depends on our health.

25:06.879 --> 25:07.960
Depends on your health, of course.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.402
We like to go.

25:10.422 --> 25:11.483
But you look forward to that.

25:11.783 --> 25:16.367
And I'm going to lift this and then let the camera come to me here in just a moment.

25:16.807 --> 25:20.030
This is something that you have in your home, and I'm going to put it right up here.

25:20.851 --> 25:23.273
And this is a shell casing.

25:23.928 --> 25:27.794
Let's see if I can hold it to where the camera can see it.

25:28.155 --> 25:30.278
This is a shell casing that you have in your home.

25:30.298 --> 25:31.620
How did you come about this?

25:31.640 --> 25:33.363
This was during your training in the states.

25:33.383 --> 25:36.127
It was in my training in Virginia.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.975
We went on the firing range and fired these.

25:41.191 --> 25:48.661
I took one of the shells and I went out and got one of the armor-piercing shells, but because of high explosive blows up, all that is in little bitty pieces.

25:49.121 --> 25:52.085
And that's what kills people with the high explosive.

25:52.366 --> 25:54.188
And this is one here is armor-piercing.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.910
It's supposed to go through a tank.

25:55.930 --> 25:59.355
They told us it would go off the front of a German tank, but it wouldn't.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.416
It would ricochet off.

26:00.456 --> 26:02.539
Their tanks were superior to ours.

26:02.559 --> 26:09.949
We had to do our firing into their suspension system, into their wheels in order to knock them out with this.

26:10.604 --> 26:11.286
I can't imagine.

26:11.306 --> 26:13.210
It's a 75 millimeter shell.

26:13.591 --> 26:16.337
I can't imagine to explain to the audience exactly how heavy that is.

26:16.417 --> 26:18.702
I held it off for about as long as I could hold it up.

26:18.722 --> 26:20.787
The projectile itself is 15 pounds.

26:21.008 --> 26:22.711
Yes.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.778
And it's designed to take out a German tank.

26:25.818 --> 26:26.299
Is that right?

26:26.360 --> 26:26.460
Yes.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.484
It goes through 30 inches of iron.

26:28.504 --> 26:28.765
Right.

26:29.065 --> 26:29.946
Right.

26:30.226 --> 26:34.910
I know you visit with the schools a lot and you tell your story.

26:34.930 --> 26:37.613
And I know that that's something that the school children like to do.

26:37.653 --> 26:42.057
And we're about out of time, but I know that that's something that they like to hear.

26:42.097 --> 26:45.399
They like to hear the story and hear the story of history of World War II.

26:45.440 --> 26:51.745
And I hope that your health continues and you'll be able to keep telling your story because it is indeed a fascinating one.

26:51.765 --> 26:55.388
And we thank you very, very much for being with us and joining us, Sergeant Cox.

26:55.909 --> 26:56.529
I enjoyed it.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.070
Thank you.

26:57.090 --> 26:57.730
I appreciate it.

26:58.091 --> 26:58.431
Indeed.

26:59.710 --> 27:04.956
George Cox recalls that June day, 61 years ago, with remarkable clarity, as you can see.

27:05.036 --> 27:08.800
Perhaps such vivid memory is the byproduct of uncommon bravery.

27:09.400 --> 27:15.026
Seated by uncommon patriotism, the greatest generation is defined by heroes like George Cox.

27:15.647 --> 27:18.890
And what an honor it is that he lives among us.

27:18.910 --> 27:25.397
We take our freedom for granted, and that's okay, as long as we remember to thank those who gave it to us.

27:25.782 --> 27:31.639
Please thank a veteran today and join me in saluting Tank Commander George Cox of Caldwell.

27:32.762 --> 27:36.453
I'm Tom Turbiville on behalf of our Underwriter First National Bank.

27:36.473 --> 27:39.201
Please join me next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
[Silence.]

27:47.000 --> 28:49.000
[Music.]
