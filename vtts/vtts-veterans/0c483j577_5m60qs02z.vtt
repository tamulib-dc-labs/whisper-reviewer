00:10.578 --> 00:34.529
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.849 --> 00:36.231
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:37.021 --> 00:43.649
Pat Patterson served his country proudly as a United States Marine, ground artillery, Operation Desert Storm.

00:43.669 --> 00:51.939
We could do an entire show on his service back in those intense months of 1991, but that's not what he wants to talk about today.

00:51.959 --> 00:59.208
Pat Patterson still serves his country by helping fellow veterans every day as a counselor for the Texas Veterans Commission.

00:59.228 --> 01:05.796
You will be amazed to hear the benefits available to military veterans, benefits that many veterans are not even aware of.

01:05.776 --> 01:07.459
It's his job to make veterans aware.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.524
And as he'll tell us, it's not a handout.

01:10.544 --> 01:12.467
It's an investment for America.

01:12.487 --> 01:13.589
Welcome to Pat Patterson.

01:14.230 --> 01:15.352
Pat, welcome to you.

01:15.392 --> 01:19.719
I know that you don't want to spend a lot of time talking about your own service, but we are going to spend a few minutes.

01:19.799 --> 01:25.889
1991, January of 1991, when Desert Shield became Desert Storm, you were a United States Marine.

01:25.909 --> 01:30.116
Talk a little bit about your service, of which you served 20 years, I know, in the Marine Corps.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.699
Talk about that time of your life.

01:32.118 --> 01:35.824
That's correct, and thank you for inviting me on to the show.

01:35.864 --> 01:44.858
I joined the Marine Corps in 79, went to the rank of Staff Sergeant, did a couple of years as a drill instructor, and then changed over to the Warrant Officer ranks.

01:45.319 --> 01:49.405
And I was a Warrant Officer when we went to Desert Storm, Desert Shield.

01:49.426 --> 01:52.270
We landed in Saudi Arabia.

01:52.250 --> 02:07.577
and Al-Jabal and moved up and actually we crossed the border the day before the ground war started and gave support to the infantry with our artillery the day of the ground war and kept moving and moved fast.

02:07.597 --> 02:13.768
Now your primary job was artillery survey, sort of looking for positions for gun positions, right?

02:13.748 --> 02:14.790
Yes, sir, that's correct.

02:15.752 --> 02:21.182
Of course, the infantry's going to, the foot soldier's going to be up front, and the artillery's in support of them.

02:21.202 --> 02:29.236
Well, I'm sort of behind the infantry, but in front of the artillery, so when they move up, they have a position where they can move into and keep moving.

02:29.296 --> 02:33.805
And that was a very fast ground war, so we were moving real quickly.

02:33.825 --> 02:34.626
And...

02:34.606 --> 02:40.417
Sometimes the infantry got everybody that they needed to, and sometimes they bypassed a few of them, but that was okay.

02:41.299 --> 02:42.601
It was all taken care of.

02:42.801 --> 02:48.152
And part of your job is what was called NBC, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Officer.

02:48.492 --> 02:50.556
That was an intense part of what you did, obviously.

02:50.536 --> 02:51.197
That's correct.

02:51.217 --> 02:58.869
You've got to remember, back in that time frame, we still thought that they had weapons of mass destruction and they were going to use them.

02:58.889 --> 03:01.492
So we were all very nervous about that.

03:02.334 --> 03:09.585
So when we crossed the border and we started moving, we were in what we call mop level, mission-oriented protective posture.

03:09.605 --> 03:12.810
We had our chemical suits on, our gloves, our boots.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.252
We had our mask at the ready.

03:14.792 --> 03:19.800
And it was a little tense there, wondering if we were going to get gassed or not.

03:20.101 --> 03:25.809
Someday I want to come bring you back on and spend 30 minutes talking about your service, but I know that that's not what you want to do today.

03:25.849 --> 03:31.436
You want to talk about the great service provided by the Texas Veterans Commission and how you're involved in that, too.

03:31.456 --> 03:33.078
So let's get on to it.

03:33.238 --> 03:45.094
And I want to tell folks that the information that you're about to get is very, very important, especially if you are a veteran, if you're related to a veteran, or if you know a veteran, listen up, because some of this information is really invaluable.

03:45.214 --> 03:47.998
Talk about the Veterans Commission, sort of its history and sort of its mission.

03:48.299 --> 03:48.900
Thanks, Tom.

03:49.240 --> 03:54.447
Tom, the Texas Veterans Commission was established by the Texas Legislature.

03:54.608 --> 03:56.771
It is a state organization.

03:56.851 --> 03:58.052
I am a state employee.

03:58.293 --> 03:59.875
It was established back in 1927.

04:01.056 --> 04:15.777
And the whole purpose of establishing the Texas Veterans Commission is to be the advocate for the veteran, to ensure that the veteran, his spouse, his dependent, or even the surviving spouse get the benefits that they rate and have well-deserved.

04:16.097 --> 04:16.838
Right, right.

04:16.818 --> 04:20.523
and sort of how it all started.

04:20.643 --> 04:24.909
Obviously it started because there was a need, because veterans just were not getting these benefits.

04:24.969 --> 04:25.410
Is that right?

04:25.730 --> 04:27.433
Oh yes sir, most definitely.

04:27.453 --> 04:37.426
The VA, the Veterans Administration, which I deal with on a daily basis, it is a very complex federal government organization.

04:37.827 --> 04:41.492
And I would like to say here, the VA is helpful.

04:41.512 --> 04:45.137
They will answer whatever question that you have.

04:45.117 --> 04:50.163
or whatever information that you need to know, they will let you know that information.

04:50.183 --> 04:55.130
The problem that most veterans have is they don't know the question to ask.

04:55.450 --> 05:05.623
They don't know what information they're seeking and you call up to the VA and they just don't have the time to sit there and go through all of this.

05:05.603 --> 05:31.695
another 100 people waiting on hold to talk to them and they don't have the time to sit down listen to what's going on get all of the facts and then tell you what benefits you rate or which ones you're eligible for and that's what we do is we have the time to sit down do a one-on-one with veterans and and have the time to look at their dd 214 to find out what they did and what benefits that they're entitled to

05:31.675 --> 05:40.600
I know one thing you were telling me when we were talking earlier was that you personally don't know all the answers, but what you do know is you know the people who do know the answers.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.969
There's a network there, so you're the person that a veteran can come to.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.697
If you can't give them the answer, you can tell them who has it.

05:46.677 --> 06:10.120
correct we have we and I use that term as people who provide benefits to the to the veterans we have made a network amongst ourselves for example the main things that we do in the Texas Veterans Commission is compensation and pension and I'd like to come back to that but if you came into my office and you were a unemployed veteran and you said Pat I

06:10.100 --> 06:11.902
I'm an unemployed veteran.

06:11.943 --> 06:13.244
I just need help getting a job.

06:13.264 --> 06:15.007
Well, that's not my area of expertise.

06:15.327 --> 06:25.121
However, I do know the man who works over at the Texas Workforce Commission, and that is his primary job to make sure that veterans and disabled veterans can gain employment.

06:25.481 --> 06:28.826
The same thing with housing.

06:28.846 --> 06:33.272
If you wanted to get an improvement on your house or you wanted to buy a house or land,

06:33.252 --> 06:41.889
That's not my area of expertise, but I do know a personal contact who works down at the Texas Veterans Land Board.

06:41.910 --> 06:43.493
We work very closely together.

06:43.914 --> 06:49.084
And what they have done in turn, if they have a veteran that comes in seeking compensation and pension,

06:49.064 --> 06:50.746
They just send them to me.

06:50.766 --> 06:59.078
So we've made a network amongst ourselves where if we're not the expert in that particular topic, we can point you to the expert.

06:59.118 --> 07:03.064
And we always tell them, if that person doesn't answer your question, come back and see me.

07:03.504 --> 07:08.311
And that's sort of our guarantee that we're just not sending them on a wild goose chase.

07:08.431 --> 07:11.916
Okay, let's talk more specifically about the compensation and pension part of the benefits.

07:11.896 --> 07:12.677
Thank you, sir.

07:12.697 --> 07:14.019
That's exactly what we do.

07:14.119 --> 07:17.303
We primarily do compensation and pension.

07:17.323 --> 07:29.998
Now, compensation is monies or treatment for injuries that were either incurred or exaggerated while they were on active duty, okay?

07:30.338 --> 07:38.308
And this can be monies or, and just as importantly, treatment for those type of conditions.

07:38.288 --> 07:48.244
The pension side of it is monies that are paid to a low-income wartime veteran who is either disabled or over the age of 65.

07:48.585 --> 07:51.670
Now, let me expand a little bit on what a wartime veteran is.

07:52.371 --> 07:57.018
A wartime veteran is a veteran who served during a time of war.

07:57.038 --> 08:00.384
It is not necessarily a combat veteran.

08:00.444 --> 08:04.971
You may have never have left the United States, but you'll still be a wartime veteran.

08:04.951 --> 08:33.051
because you served during a time of war now what congress has said is congress has said for our wartime veterans that are either disabled or they are over 65 if they're low income if their income is below a certain threshold then we being the veterans administration will pay them a pension to get them up to that certain threshold now i would grant you that i wish they would make the threshold a little bit higher

08:33.031 --> 08:38.780
But it's not as high as I'd like it to be, but it's out there.

08:39.140 --> 08:50.578
And for our low-income wartime veterans, it's something they need to check into because also what's taken off of their total income is any unreimbursed medical expenses that they have.

08:50.598 --> 08:58.810
So that's taken off their income to see if they're below that, to see if they're eligible for a pension.

08:59.211 --> 08:59.832
Right.

08:59.812 --> 09:02.857
More on medical benefits.

09:02.877 --> 09:03.238
Yes, sir.

09:03.298 --> 09:08.246
The medical benefits, again, that's not my area of expertise.

09:08.266 --> 09:09.728
I know just enough to be dangerous.

09:10.910 --> 09:13.354
There are the medical side.

09:13.414 --> 09:18.262
A lot of people don't even realize that we have a VA clinic here in College Station.

09:18.382 --> 09:22.008
But we do have a superb VA clinic here in College Station.

09:22.549 --> 09:26.916
And the way that the VA medical works is there's priority groups.

09:26.896 --> 09:30.602
There's eight different priority groups, and you've got to prioritize.

09:30.623 --> 09:31.524
There are so many veterans.

09:31.805 --> 09:39.538
You've got to prioritize how you're going to see these veterans and also how they're going to pay for it, okay?

09:39.558 --> 09:42.964
Priority group eight is mainly based on your income.

09:42.944 --> 09:50.864
If you have a high income, then they may charge you full price for your medication and for your doctor's visits.

09:50.884 --> 09:58.523
If you have a low income, then they may just request a small copay for, again, for your medications and your doctor's visits.

09:58.503 --> 10:02.929
The other seven priority groups have nothing to do with your income.

10:03.249 --> 10:09.858
What they have to do with is if you are service connected or not, and what percentage you are service connected.

10:09.878 --> 10:11.901
We're talking service connected disabilities.

10:12.362 --> 10:26.721
So if I had a veteran who came in and say he lost hearing or had tinnitus, the ringing in the ear, and that was from his service, and we got him service connected at 0%,

10:26.701 --> 10:31.168
He's going to think, well, it's service-connected, but it's 0%, so there's no benefits to it.

10:31.429 --> 10:32.530
Well, that's wrong.

10:32.550 --> 10:44.490
Because he is service-connected, even at 0%, he is put in a higher priority group where he would only have to pay a copay for his medications and his doctor's visits.

10:44.510 --> 10:52.202
Additionally, because it is a service-connected disability, any treatment that he would need for that

10:52.182 --> 10:54.466
would be paid for by the VA.

10:55.108 --> 11:04.747
And if you've priced hearing aids lately, they're around four or $5,000 nowadays, so they're sort of expensive, but those would be paid for by the VA.

11:06.791 --> 11:14.646
On the medical side, there is a couple of special ones that I'd like to talk about, and that are these registries that we have.

11:14.626 --> 11:17.188
The VA has medical registries.

11:17.248 --> 11:26.556
Now, what a registry is, it is a medical examination for special groups of individuals, for special groups of veterans.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.579
There are four of these VA registries.

11:29.599 --> 11:31.921
There's the ionized radiation registry.

11:31.941 --> 11:44.532
Now, this is mainly for the veterans who participated in the nuclear testing here in the United States or who were required to walk through Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bomb was dropped over there.

11:44.512 --> 11:49.420
They were exposed to radiation, so any disabilities that they have from that.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.803
There's the depleted uranium registry.

11:51.824 --> 12:04.143
Now, that's mainly for those who were either in Afghanistan or in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, where some of the munitions that were used over there had uranium in it if they were exposed to that.

12:04.924 --> 12:09.912
There's the Gulf War registry, and that's for those of us who was in the Gulf War.

12:09.892 --> 12:13.436
And it's really undiagnosed illnesses.

12:13.456 --> 12:17.880
They really haven't figured out some of the illnesses that people have come back with.

12:19.222 --> 12:25.288
The one that is used probably the most is the Agent Orange Registry.

12:25.849 --> 12:32.015
Now, the Agent Orange Registry is for veterans who served in Vietnam, in country in Vietnam.

12:32.496 --> 12:39.223
The VA has stated if you were in country in Vietnam, you were exposed to Agent Orange.

12:39.203 --> 12:41.427
It doesn't matter where you were.

12:41.708 --> 12:45.995
You don't have to say, I was here or there, just that you were in country.

12:46.797 --> 12:58.258
And if you were exposed to Agent Orange, there are 11 diseases that the VA has said that they directly relate back to Agent Orange.

12:58.238 --> 13:08.935
And I know a lot of those diseases are cancer type diseases, whether they're skin cancers or other kinds of cancers, but one of those illnesses is diabetes, and that's one that you want to particularly talk about.

13:08.955 --> 13:09.716
Oh, yes, sir.

13:09.736 --> 13:10.117
Yes, sir.

13:10.397 --> 13:10.718
You're right.

13:10.758 --> 13:22.997
A lot of them are the skin cancers, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas, even prostate cancer, but the one that is most prevalent is diabetes.

13:22.977 --> 13:31.308
And diabetes is a vicious disease because not only, it affects a lot of other organs.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.252
It has secondary conditions.

13:34.312 --> 13:38.518
For example, the individual may have peripheral neuropathy.

13:38.898 --> 13:43.945
And what that is is either in the arms or the legs, a burning sensation.

13:44.065 --> 13:46.048
Those appendices go to sleep.

13:46.028 --> 13:48.712
lack of circulation.

13:48.772 --> 13:54.101
It's neurological, but it's a secondary condition from the diabetes.

13:54.502 --> 14:02.254
They also may have frequent urination, erectile dysfunction, problems with their vision.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.319
All of those are secondary conditions of the diabetes.

14:05.379 --> 14:06.501
Now remember,

14:06.481 --> 14:23.680
If the person was on Vietnam, and they were exposed to Agent Orange, and the VA connects the diabetes to the exposure to Agent Orange, then all of the secondary conditions that the individual has, those that I just mentioned, are also service-connected.

14:24.041 --> 14:27.845
And so those also can be compensated by the VA.

14:28.065 --> 14:29.107
A real important one.

14:29.447 --> 14:30.328
Yes, sir.

14:30.308 --> 14:38.041
The government considers that if, as you told me, if you had boots on the ground in Vietnam, then you were exposed to Agent Orange.

14:38.401 --> 14:56.371
If you were aboard a ship and the ship stayed off the coast, but then one time it came into port, you jumped off the ship, you ran up there, and you grabbed a beer, and you ran back onto the ship, and you can prove you had boots on the ground grabbing that beer at that bar, then you were exposed to Agent Orange.

14:56.391 --> 14:56.772
Yes, sir.

14:57.848 --> 15:00.734
Pretty amazing information that people really, really need to know.

15:00.754 --> 15:06.607
We're going to get back to the medical in a little bit, but I want to move on to education because I think this is just fascinating.

15:06.648 --> 15:10.917
Some of the things you told me is what I referred to earlier as an investment in America.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.946
Tell the folks what you told me about education and the benefits.

15:15.010 --> 15:22.580
I am the prime example of, I think, the best education program that the VA has.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.923
I dropped out of school in the ninth grade to join the Marine Corps.

15:25.564 --> 15:36.218
When I retired, I came back here to Bryan College Station and I was looking for a job and found out that there's not a big demand for artillery officers around the Brazos Valley.

15:36.238 --> 15:38.602
And the VA recognized that also.

15:39.142 --> 15:44.950
And so what they did was they sent me to school under a program called the Vocational Rehabilitation Program.

15:44.930 --> 15:47.173
The VA paid for my tuition.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.695
They paid for my books.

15:48.855 --> 15:53.782
They paid for my pens, pencils, and paper, and gave me a tax-free living allowance on top of that.

15:54.223 --> 15:59.009
Now, you may say, wow, that's a big gimme.

15:59.570 --> 16:04.997
However, they've done research and studies, and when I went, and this was only a few years ago,

16:04.977 --> 16:11.030
I graduated in 2004, the statistics was seven for one.

16:11.431 --> 16:22.395
For every $1, the federal government invests in a veteran for education, the federal government gets $7 in return by taxes.

16:22.375 --> 16:25.280
So, I could have got out of the Marine Corps and been a night watchman.

16:25.300 --> 16:33.634
I could have been a great janitor, maybe minimum wage or maybe a little bit above that, and I would have been paying federal taxes on those dollars.

16:34.075 --> 16:36.339
However, they sent me to school.

16:36.439 --> 16:40.165
They got me a, well, I helped a little bit getting an education.

16:40.145 --> 16:46.033
They paid for it and now I'm making a little bit more money and paying more in taxes.

16:46.334 --> 16:49.398
So it's a seven for one benefit for the government.

16:49.418 --> 16:52.061
It is an investment and it's a win-win situation.

16:52.382 --> 16:59.031
Now this is a great program for those young vets that we have coming back from Iraq.

16:59.011 --> 17:02.881
You have to have three requirements to be eligible for this.

17:02.901 --> 17:04.826
You have to have an honorable discharge.

17:04.846 --> 17:09.379
You have to have a disability rating of 20% or more.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.344
And you have to have an employment handicap.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.472
And it's an easy...

17:14.452 --> 17:21.467
I'm not saying it's an easy program to get accepted for, but the VA really wants, is pushing this program.

17:21.788 --> 17:22.810
And so is the federal government.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.355
It's a win-win situation for everybody.

17:25.375 --> 17:34.755
And a lot of these young vets coming back from Iraq that don't decide not to make the military a career, this is a perfect one for them.

17:34.735 --> 17:36.637
education programs out there.

17:36.657 --> 17:39.059
Again, I'm not the expert at the education program.

17:39.079 --> 17:43.303
That was near and dear to my heart because that's how I'm here today.

17:44.344 --> 17:48.187
But I do know the expert in the education program.

17:48.227 --> 17:51.470
If they just come up to my office, I'd be more than happy to point them in the right direction.

17:51.751 --> 17:51.871
Right.

17:51.891 --> 18:03.021
Well, as you and I were discussing the other day on this education thing, sure, a man or a woman can come back, say, from Iraq or wherever they served.

18:03.001 --> 18:07.826
And they could go for the minimum wage job if they wanted to, if that's the route that they wanted to go to.

18:09.468 --> 18:12.872
But the government is saying, hey, we want to give back to you for your service.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.014
We want to give you an education.

18:15.035 --> 18:19.780
And that's sort of a mutual back scratch there because, like you said, that person goes through college.

18:20.100 --> 18:28.610
Instead of making $6 or $7 an hour, that person may be making $50, $60, $70,000 a year that they're paying taxes on, which benefits the government.

18:28.630 --> 18:29.751
Plus,

18:29.917 --> 18:37.710
Another thing that we brought up was that that person that's making $50,000 or $60,000 a year because they've been through college, they've got more buying power out there.

18:37.790 --> 18:47.347
They're paying sales tax every time they buy those expensive cars rather than the cheaper cars, and that's helping the state that they live in, especially the state of Texas.

18:47.367 --> 18:47.887
So you're right.

18:47.928 --> 18:49.110
It's a win-win deal, isn't it?

18:49.230 --> 18:49.610
Yes, sir.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.592
Most definitely.

18:50.572 --> 18:56.139
And yeah, they're actually paying my salary as an employee of the state.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.001
That's what they're doing.

18:58.041 --> 19:01.786
And it is a mutual beneficial proposition.

19:01.806 --> 19:02.106
Yes, sir.

19:02.607 --> 19:10.977
Pat, I know that another thing you want to talk about, we're going to get back to sort of the medical end, and it's PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.

19:11.176 --> 19:21.770
I do not know if you saw the news two weeks ago, Friday two weeks ago, and I came bouncing out of my office to watch it on TV.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.294
A veteran got back from Iraq.

19:24.895 --> 19:25.936
He got out of the service.

19:26.437 --> 19:28.940
He put in for PTSD.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.443
He made a claim through the VA for PTSD.

19:31.864 --> 19:38.533
They denied his claim, and about 30 days later, he took his own life.

19:38.513 --> 19:54.463
And it really, really upset me because I know that the only reason he was denied his claim was probably because he did not give them all the information that they needed for that claim.

19:54.483 --> 19:57.889
That's why I want so strongly for people

19:57.869 --> 20:01.294
if they have a problem, to come see me about it.

20:01.814 --> 20:17.776
Post-traumatic stress disorder, the PTSD, it is a recognizable, compensatable ailment, disability that the VA has said, yes, we do agree with that.

20:17.796 --> 20:21.801
Now, there are some criteria for it, and there has to be.

20:21.781 --> 20:26.869
You just have to be able to prove it some way.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.511
There's three elements.

20:28.532 --> 20:34.821
Number one is you have to have a traumatic event that happened to you while you were on active duty.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.866
The second element is you have to have a diagnosis

20:37.846 --> 20:43.771
from a psychiatrist or a psychologist that you have post-traumatic stress disorder.

20:43.791 --> 20:57.604
And the third thing is that psychiatrist or psychologist has to make a Lexus, a connection between the PTSD that you currently suffer and that event that happened while you were on active duty.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.286
Now this is primarily for combat.

21:00.306 --> 21:01.948
It primarily is for combat.

21:01.968 --> 21:04.350
However, it's not exclusively for combat.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.853
I've put in a couple of claims for, actually there were two

21:07.833 --> 21:12.419
sailors different times that were not in combat.

21:12.539 --> 21:15.624
One sailor was aboard a ship in Norfolk.

21:16.385 --> 21:17.506
The ship caught on fire.

21:17.706 --> 21:20.310
He was caught below the fire.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.012
It was very traumatic for him.

21:22.212 --> 21:26.378
He still has dreams and nightmares of being trapped below this fire.

21:26.718 --> 21:29.162
The other one was on a submarine.

21:29.342 --> 21:31.905
It did an emergency blow or an emergency dive.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.047
He was in the engine room.

21:33.027 --> 21:38.595
A huge piece of metal came flying across the room and killed his friend.

21:38.815 --> 21:42.440
Again, right in front of him, a traumatic event.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.702
Those things are documented.

21:43.822 --> 21:51.672
Even if it wasn't combat, that is a documented event that we can establish the stressor, as it's called.

21:52.133 --> 21:57.921
If you're in combat in the Marine Corps, because I was in combat, for example, we got our combat action ribbon.

21:57.901 --> 22:04.087
In the Army, if you're in the infantry and you're in combat, you get the Army infantryman badge.

22:05.008 --> 22:12.316
If you're not in infantry in the Army and you're in combat, you don't have a similar device that shows that.

22:12.436 --> 22:15.359
Neither does the Navy or the Air Force.

22:15.659 --> 22:19.603
And those, the VA has said, okay, we will accept this as your stressor.

22:19.643 --> 22:25.309
You don't have to tell us about it in great detail to have that initial stressor.

22:25.289 --> 22:33.382
If you had the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Silver Star, any type of insignia with a combat V for valor in combat, that's your stressor.

22:35.546 --> 22:43.939
If not, and I sort of hate this, but the VA will ask you to write out what happened, when it happened, where it happened,

22:43.919 --> 22:45.081
Who was there?

22:45.401 --> 22:51.750
That's a tough thing, but some veterans just refuse to do that, and I understand them, and my heart goes out to them.

22:52.431 --> 22:55.976
Then the second thing is getting to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

22:56.016 --> 23:00.762
We have a social worker at the clinic there in College Station.

23:00.842 --> 23:11.597
She is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but she's the doorway to the VA's psychiatrist and psychologist, and then he's the one who makes the determination, the Lexus between the two of them.

23:12.202 --> 23:15.587
There might be a lot of veterans who have it and don't know that they have it.

23:15.867 --> 23:19.573
You told me an example the other day about the frog.

23:19.934 --> 23:21.756
Talk about that, about the frog in the water.

23:21.776 --> 23:22.197
Yes, sir.

23:22.638 --> 23:26.443
And that's the analogy that I use.

23:27.345 --> 23:28.386
Some people would say it's cute.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.528
Some would say it's lame.

23:30.149 --> 23:32.933
I think it tells the story, though.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.135
It is vivid.

23:34.355 --> 23:35.577
If I took...

23:35.557 --> 23:50.578
a pot of water and put it on a stove and put a frog in it and then turned the fire on on the stove and just slowly moved it up, the water would start boiling and the frog would boil to death.

23:50.558 --> 23:58.926
However, if I took that same pot of water, I put it on the stove and started the water boiling and then threw the frog in, well, he's going to hop right back out.

23:59.207 --> 24:10.198
Well, it's very similar to our veterans who it escalates so slowly that they're inside the bubble and they don't realize that these things are happening.

24:10.558 --> 24:17.545
I have a list of symptoms of the PTSD.

24:17.525 --> 24:28.348
And I, when a veteran and his spouse come in, and I think that he might have it, and sometimes they come in, they don't even ask about it.

24:28.668 --> 24:34.220
But I look at their DD-214, and I say, Purple Heart, Bronze Star, I can tell that they were in combat.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.124
And just by talking to them,

24:36.104 --> 24:44.554
I might pick up on some signs, or symptoms I should say, and I will give him and her a copy of these symptoms.

24:44.594 --> 24:48.899
And I'll say, just go ahead and mark down the ones that you think apply to you.

24:49.280 --> 24:53.024
Well, the veteran will take his time and he'll see one or two or three.

24:53.385 --> 24:57.169
The wife over there on the other hand, she'll be marking six or seven or eight of them so fast.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.092
And he looks at her and, honey, I don't do that.

25:00.112 --> 25:01.354
Yeah, you do.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.916
You just don't realize it.

25:03.416 --> 25:04.778
And that's the thing.

25:04.758 --> 25:07.655
You've got about a minute I want you to touch on.

25:07.695 --> 25:10.894
You talked about power of attorney and that service.

25:10.914 --> 25:11.578
Talk about that.

25:11.626 --> 25:12.687
Yes, sir.

25:12.828 --> 25:27.548
A power of attorney gives us, us being whatever service-connected organization, the authority to check with the VA, to work on your claim, to answer any questions that you have, to look into your file.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.450
It is specific power of attorney.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.776
It is for and only for working with the VA on your behalf.

25:33.796 --> 25:38.663
We are a service, we being the Texas Veterans Commission, is a service-connected organization.

25:38.643 --> 25:47.512
There's a lot of service connection organizations that do it, just like us, the Veterans of Foreign War, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.614
All of them can do the same thing that I do.

25:50.435 --> 25:52.618
The reason we do it best is because this is all we do.

25:53.338 --> 25:57.603
Seven days a week, well, five days a week, sometimes seven days a week.

25:57.783 --> 26:04.650
Monday through Friday, I'm at the VA outpatient clinic, 7.30 in the morning until 4.35 in the afternoon.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.723
You don't have to set an appointment.

26:06.743 --> 26:10.506
All they have to do is come in and sign up on my little clipboard and come see me.

26:10.604 --> 26:11.325
That's what they did.

26:11.365 --> 26:13.968
There's probably people yelling at the TV saying, where are you?

26:14.008 --> 26:15.270
Let's tell them where you are.

26:15.290 --> 26:20.956
You're in College Station in the medical building, the big black medical building across the street from the Med on Rock Prairie, right?

26:20.976 --> 26:21.537
Exactly right.

26:21.557 --> 26:29.406
We're in suite 212, right across the street from the Med in that black building that's black glass.

26:29.767 --> 26:35.714
And if you notice, when you come up there, there is construction that is going on just to the east of that building.

26:35.754 --> 26:36.915
That is our new clinic.

26:36.935 --> 26:39.058
We are building a new and bigger clinic.

26:39.038 --> 26:42.223
to have more doctors and nurses to serve our veterans.

26:42.384 --> 26:44.127
Fantastic, it's great service what you do.

26:44.607 --> 26:49.596
Thank you again for your service at Desert Storm and thank you for the service that you give to all veterans.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.681
Wish we had more time, but we're out of time, but I think we got it covered.

26:52.701 --> 26:53.282
Thank you, sir.

26:53.302 --> 26:54.364
Thank you, Pat.

26:54.344 --> 27:03.556
From serving in the ground battles of Desert Storm to serving now behind the desk at the Texas Veterans Commission, it's Pat Patterson's passion to stand by veterans.

27:03.837 --> 27:08.022
We owe all our veterans a debt, and he wants to make sure that debt is paid.

27:08.042 --> 27:13.189
Thanks to Pat Patterson and all veterans for your service, and thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:13.469 --> 27:19.077
Be sure to read more stories of veterans by reading Brazos Valley Heroes each Sunday in The Eagle.

27:19.597 --> 27:21.420
For Pat Patterson, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.963
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
