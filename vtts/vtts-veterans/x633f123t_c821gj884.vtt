00:03.524 --> 00:27.449
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:27.909 --> 00:28.890
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:29.765 --> 00:34.229
Gene Barber served the people of Burleson County as its sheriff for seven years.

00:34.249 --> 00:38.273
He sold cars and lumber and delivered the mail in the years before that.

00:38.494 --> 00:50.746
But that all came after 33 months at sea, serving aboard the USS Carrier Corregidor during four major battles of World War II's Pacific Campaign, a resident of Caldwell since the early 50s.

00:50.826 --> 00:53.728
And you will not find a bigger Bob Wills fan anywhere.

00:53.748 --> 00:54.409
And why not?

00:54.429 --> 00:57.392
He and Bob Wills share the town of Cossie as a birthplace.

00:57.372 --> 01:00.598
It's a pleasure to welcome Gene Barber to Veterans of the Valley.

01:00.678 --> 01:02.761
Indeed, it is a pleasure to welcome you, Gene.

01:03.202 --> 01:04.725
I want to get right to your service.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.888
First off, when you joined up, you were kind of young.

01:06.908 --> 01:08.972
You graduated from high school when you were 16.

01:09.593 --> 01:13.159
By 17, you were ready to go, but mom and dad sort of had different ideas.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.882
You kind of butted heads on that, right?

01:15.363 --> 01:15.884
That's true.

01:16.004 --> 01:22.435
I went to Dallas, Texas and sent the papers back home to mom and dad and asked them if they wouldn't sign them and send them up there.

01:22.415 --> 01:27.121
My dad thought I was too young, thought I ought to wait until I was 18, you know, like the rest of the guys.

01:27.201 --> 01:27.882
Right.

01:27.902 --> 01:28.383
But I didn't.

01:28.403 --> 01:34.311
They sent him back, and my first troop train trip was from Dallas, Texas to San Diego.

01:34.531 --> 01:34.731
Right.

01:34.751 --> 01:35.693
You were 17 years old.

01:35.713 --> 01:36.574
17 years old.

01:36.954 --> 01:38.837
That must have been kind of a scary deal for you.

01:38.857 --> 01:43.002
I know you were gung-ho ready to go, but it must have been kind of a scary deal for a 17-year-old.

01:43.263 --> 01:45.506
That's a long way away from your hometown of Bremont.

01:45.526 --> 01:48.590
It really is, and no one went in with me from my hometown.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.311
That was the thing.

01:49.371 --> 01:50.312
I was by myself.

01:50.292 --> 01:54.017
And the only person that I really got acquainted with was Kilroy.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.760
Every place I went, he'd done been there.

01:56.100 --> 01:56.801
Exactly.

01:57.342 --> 01:58.824
That's what you saw, the signs, right?

01:58.844 --> 01:59.745
The signs were everywhere.

01:59.785 --> 02:02.870
The fact that you did join up probably kept you from going to Europe.

02:02.910 --> 02:07.616
A lot of the kids that were drafted at that time did go to Europe, served in the Battle of the Bulge some tough times.

02:07.937 --> 02:10.580
You lost some friends there, I know, in Europe.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.766
But by joining up, you got assignment to the Pacific.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.247
That's true.

02:15.988 --> 02:18.291
My best friend was a little bit older than I.

02:18.271 --> 02:25.364
And he joined, he waited until he was drafted, and then he was in the Battle of the Bulge and lost his life there.

02:26.326 --> 02:27.589
Dan Scott McCall Jr.

02:27.649 --> 02:30.715
was one of the best friends that I had in high school, played football together.

02:32.137 --> 02:35.404
Dan went to Europe.

02:35.424 --> 02:36.646
I went to the Navy.

02:36.726 --> 02:40.954
I chose the Navy because I thought I'd learned something in the Navy, and I did.

02:41.120 --> 02:41.821
Right.

02:41.841 --> 02:50.932
All this was after you had served some eight years in the Air Force Reserve, and that's sort of where you learned to trade as a machinist, which is the way that you eventually served in the Navy.

02:51.653 --> 02:55.097
Well, I learned to be a machinist in the Navy.

02:55.117 --> 02:55.337
Right.

02:56.399 --> 02:59.983
I went through in November of 1942.

03:00.063 --> 03:03.247
The war had been going on since December of 41.

03:03.787 --> 03:04.068
Right.

03:04.368 --> 03:04.849
Pearl Harbor.

03:04.869 --> 03:05.249
Pearl Harbor.

03:06.070 --> 03:08.393
And I was lucky in boot camp.

03:08.575 --> 03:11.860
The four camps in San Diego are right together.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.968
There's Camp Decatur, and Camp Luce, and Camp Mahan, and Camp Farragut.

03:17.548 --> 03:20.593
And you go to Decatur for the boot camp.

03:21.274 --> 03:25.881
And when you get out of boot camp, then if you get a school, you may stay in the same area.

03:26.422 --> 03:27.043
And I was lucky.

03:27.063 --> 03:29.687
I got to group three schools in San Diego, California.

03:30.388 --> 03:38.059
And they taught me how to use a hammer, and a hacksaw, and a file.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.224
And hand tubes.

03:39.985 --> 03:44.111
And they also gave us some time on the lathe, mini-machine, and shaper.

03:44.131 --> 03:45.413
And I applied myself.

03:45.473 --> 03:50.981
I finally decided that maybe I needed to, you know, bear down and do things like you ought to do.

03:51.342 --> 04:02.398
And they gave me a fireman first rate out of Group 3 schools and assigned me my first assignment at new construction out of Astoria, Oregon.

04:02.778 --> 04:05.262
And that's where we picked up the Corregidor.

04:05.242 --> 04:07.605
Talk about the USS Corregidor.

04:07.645 --> 04:14.694
I know it was what you call a baby flattop, a smaller carrier, usually held like 18 bombers, 18 fighters.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.416
A little bit of the history of the Corregidor.

04:16.456 --> 04:26.929
I'll tell the folks originally it was the Algila Bay, but then it was reassigned as the Corregidor, launched in May of 1943, built by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company.

04:26.909 --> 04:36.220
It joined the Carrier Division 24 at Pearl Harbor for airstrikes in the Gilbert Islands, and then later in early 44 in the Marshall Islands operations providing air cover.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.263
That was just pretty much its job.

04:38.283 --> 04:42.988
Now you talk about your impressions of the ship where you lived for so long.

04:43.509 --> 04:52.039
Well, you know, the reason why I give them credit for teaching me discipline, when I first went aboard the carrier,

04:52.576 --> 05:02.675
I was a member of the original crew, which they call you a plank owner, especially on the flight, plank owner in the flight deck of the ship that you're assigned to.

05:03.116 --> 05:05.381
Well, I am a plank owner in the USS Corregidor.

05:06.503 --> 05:09.990
And I picked up the ship.

05:10.050 --> 05:12.795
They brought it down from Vancouver.

05:13.670 --> 05:23.923
down the river to Astoria and Seaside, two little places there in Oregon.

05:23.943 --> 05:29.630
And we came aboard the first day, and you always muster on the flight deck.

05:29.650 --> 05:33.956
But I mustered on the flight deck in my blues, and I went down to the engine room in my blues.

05:35.178 --> 05:38.682
And an old chief that was there was sitting on a bank of

05:39.134 --> 06:08.753
valves and he called me over because he saw i was different from the others and i had my blues on and he gave me my first assignment right which which was and uh he's a tough old bird he was tough yeah and it was a it was a good assignment i was everybody else was in their dungarees right but i was in my blues and he told me he said go back up top side and get you some new underwear clean underwear right and a change of clothes and come back

06:09.239 --> 06:11.501
And I thought, well, what in the world is going on?

06:11.521 --> 06:12.863
What kind of Navy is this?

06:13.443 --> 06:17.887
And when I came back, he told me, he said, there's a chore we've got to do.

06:17.947 --> 06:20.510
And he said, you've been chosen to do it.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.113
He said, take the plate up, the floor plate up.

06:23.133 --> 06:23.913
And we took it up.

06:23.933 --> 06:30.019
And underneath that floor plate was another plate that had a great number of bolts in it.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.641
And it was in the main sump tank.

06:31.761 --> 06:33.383
It was on the main sump tank of the engine.

06:34.564 --> 06:37.947
The engine was a Skinner Uniflow engine made in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

06:38.517 --> 06:49.053
And it wasn't the type of reciprocating engine that the old Navy had, which you had three pistons, you know, a big one and an intermediate and a small one, and they exhausted from one piston to the other.

06:49.413 --> 06:49.814
Right.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.376
Skinner Uniflows were like a diesel.

06:52.578 --> 07:02.854
And they had run this ship, the two engines that were on the ship, two motors that had brought it down from Bremerton, not from Bremerton, Vancouver.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.356
Right.

07:04.808 --> 07:13.298
On the shakedown, you've got to pump the main sump oil out and renew it, like changing your oil in an engine.

07:13.318 --> 07:14.219
And this was your job to do.

07:14.239 --> 07:15.180
This was my job.

07:15.881 --> 07:16.361
And you did it.

07:17.623 --> 07:29.517
We crawled down in the sump and wiped all the way from the front to the end of the sump with rags and took every bit of oil and every bit of babbit that had come off of those bearings.

07:29.737 --> 07:29.837
Yeah.

07:30.104 --> 07:31.645
and got them out and put new oil in it.

07:32.626 --> 07:38.051
And when I got out, I thought, well, now, I was sweating just about as much as I was wiping oil.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.372
I was wiping sweat off myself.

07:39.392 --> 07:46.959
And he told me, he said, now go back up and put your clothes on and come back.

07:46.979 --> 07:51.203
When I came back in, he said, you see that little line over in the corner there?

07:51.523 --> 07:56.648
And we call, you know, valves and pipes, all types are called lines.

07:56.728 --> 07:58.930
And he said, I want to know what's in the line.

07:59.618 --> 08:03.242
which way it's going, how much pressure's on it, and where to cut it off.

08:03.362 --> 08:06.906
And he said, before you leave here today, you come tell me.

08:06.926 --> 08:14.695
And I looked at him, he said, every man in this engine room will know everything about every line in here.

08:15.936 --> 08:17.057
And of course, that's for safety.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.480
You take a hit, you got to know where to cut it off.

08:20.581 --> 08:23.825
I learned every line in the engine room.

08:23.845 --> 08:25.086
I thought they were picking on me.

08:25.387 --> 08:26.949
But it was something we had to do.

08:27.149 --> 08:32.937
It turns out, though, that this superior, whenever you came up for promotion, he recommended you for promotion.

08:32.997 --> 08:33.217
Every time.

08:33.237 --> 08:33.557
Every time.

08:33.577 --> 08:36.741
So obviously there was a lot of respect there that you gained for him.

08:37.562 --> 08:41.427
Corregidor, you said, was in four major battles, and you were in those battles with him.

08:41.467 --> 08:45.552
Talk a little bit about the major battles that you were in and some of your memories of those.

08:45.612 --> 08:49.217
I know this was the height of the war in the Pacific.

08:49.197 --> 08:59.589
Well, we set out from Pearl Harbor with the Corregidor and Liscombe Bay and the Coral Sea, which were three baby flattops that were built right together, 26, 57, and 58.

09:00.630 --> 09:08.119
And we had other ships in the formation, of course, and went down to take what we thought was the first islands back from the Japanese.

09:09.080 --> 09:15.127
It was in the three islands that we were to look at were Macon, Little Macon, and Trawawa.

09:16.108 --> 09:18.411
And I'd never heard of those islands, you know.

09:19.049 --> 09:23.496
Meantime, we had practiced doing sub patrol.

09:24.417 --> 09:39.020
In those days, they had a torpedo-looking object that was called a Fido that they'd drop in the water, and it would sit there until a ship came between buoys that they had placed or submarines.

09:39.040 --> 09:46.311
And when it came by, then that thing would take off after them like a dog, and it was powered by compressed air.

09:46.692 --> 09:46.812
Right.

09:47.315 --> 09:51.520
And if it didn't hit the ship, then it would sink to the bottom of the ocean and wouldn't bother nobody.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.283
We tried those things for a while and did that for a little while.

09:54.303 --> 10:07.318
But when we went to Tarawa and Macon and Little Macon, we went to give support to the ground troops, which was something that baby flattops, we didn't think were maybe really capable of doing a good job, but we did.

10:08.379 --> 10:16.528
In the mornings, we would, about four o'clock in the morning, they'd call general quarters, get everybody up, and they'd

10:16.998 --> 10:25.932
refuel all the planes and bring all the bombs up from the, or whatever they're going to use that day, to the ships and put them aboard.

10:26.533 --> 10:33.964
Then they'd take off about daylight because we didn't have people that flew at night, not on baby flattops, and had the F-4Fs.

10:34.244 --> 10:35.767
The fighters were the F-4F Wildcats.

10:35.787 --> 10:36.648
F-4F fighter Wildcats.

10:36.668 --> 10:38.010
They were made by Grumman.

10:38.362 --> 10:45.154
And the TBM, like the president has out at the museum, was one of the planes that we had on there.

10:45.254 --> 10:46.416
Right, right, right.

10:46.436 --> 10:47.718
The Avenger, I believe.

10:47.738 --> 10:49.241
Avenger, that's right.

10:49.261 --> 10:51.004
Those were two, TBMs and TBF.

10:51.164 --> 10:54.089
One was just made in a different place from the other, but they were both just alike.

10:55.211 --> 11:00.480
And we gave them ground support every morning, fly them off and bring them back.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.023
And it's a beautiful thing to watch.

11:02.577 --> 11:07.363
If you've ever been to sea on a carrier, the way that they take off and the way that they land.

11:07.503 --> 11:08.985
I cannot imagine seeing it in person.

11:09.085 --> 11:17.235
Obviously, I've seen old war footage of it, but I'm sure that it doesn't do it justice is actually seeing it, especially as the sound and the sight.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.458
When they land, when they take off, they're loaded.

11:19.838 --> 11:20.078
Right.

11:20.499 --> 11:22.982
And on a baby flattop, you have to steam into the wind.

11:23.570 --> 11:27.955
You had to turn it into the wind because it didn't go fast enough, 19 knots.

11:27.975 --> 11:30.879
If there wasn't any wind, it was hard for them to get altitude.

11:31.099 --> 11:31.519
Right.

11:31.540 --> 11:35.104
And sometimes they'd go in the drink when they'd go off the front of the ship.

11:35.124 --> 11:38.047
They'd go down like this and then pull up.

11:38.187 --> 11:42.633
The length of the Corregidor was 512 feet, 3 inches to be exact.

11:42.653 --> 11:43.654
That's about a football field.

11:43.674 --> 11:44.135
Football field.

11:44.295 --> 11:44.495
Right.

11:44.815 --> 11:49.060
The best carrier, best pilots in the world were on those carriers.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.525
If you could land on one of those things, you could land on anything.

11:52.645 --> 11:52.885
Right.

11:53.658 --> 11:57.422
Anyway, we'd fly them in, and they would come back and get another load and go.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.066
And they bombed Trawawa forever.

12:01.327 --> 12:09.216
And the big ships that were there, like I believe the Big Potato was there, Utah and some of those, they shelled that island forever.

12:09.316 --> 12:15.242
There wasn't anything left hardly standing, but they were dug into where, when the Marines went in there, we had terrible losses.

12:15.743 --> 12:16.464
It was terrible.

12:16.664 --> 12:18.246
You know, the men that we lost.

12:18.266 --> 12:20.188
Lost more men there than ever.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.910
And of course, the worst thing that happened to us

12:22.480 --> 12:36.720
One morning when we were doing all this, getting ready to go bomb, and they were piping up the fuel and bringing up the bombs to load the planes to send them off.

12:36.820 --> 12:43.610
USS Liscombe Bay was steaming about 220 yards off of our, I believe it was a starboard bow.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.951
We were all freed right together.

12:46.093 --> 12:48.977
And a Japanese submarine

12:50.459 --> 12:59.660
launched a torpedo that hit about three quarters of the way back on the USS Vescombe Bay.

13:01.224 --> 13:02.828
And I never had any idea.

13:02.868 --> 13:04.512
We knew what was going on.

13:04.552 --> 13:05.955
We were at quarters already.

13:06.135 --> 13:09.042
We were at general quarters because we were getting ready like everybody else.

13:09.562 --> 13:18.450
And when we heard the commotion and heard what was going on, I was stationed then, of course, I still had my red stripe.

13:18.470 --> 13:21.873
It was my first trip down at a repair station.

13:22.854 --> 13:28.759
And me and Paul Argo, another guy, we pulled up and went up the uptakes.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.142
Uptakes on the ship is where the air circulates back up.

13:32.162 --> 13:35.905
They pump air down into the ship, and then it goes back up and out the side.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.028
We went through the uptakes, and we watched

13:39.599 --> 13:41.951
as the Liscombe Bay was sinking.

13:43.217 --> 13:44.282
Terrible, terrible thing.

13:44.342 --> 13:48.141
They couldn't even get water to put, you know, on the fire.

13:48.847 --> 13:52.231
The gasoline that they were putting in the airplanes ignited on a hangar deck.

13:53.072 --> 13:58.399
And the whole ship from one end to the other was burning and red hot.

13:58.419 --> 14:00.822
And it sank stern first.

14:00.842 --> 14:04.446
It went down with the back end going down first.

14:04.466 --> 14:08.411
And they lost over 600 men in about 20 minutes.

14:09.092 --> 14:15.360
And it was, well, if you've never seen it before and you're on a ship just like it,

14:15.340 --> 14:18.484
You wonder, what in the world are we doing out here with this?

14:18.544 --> 14:18.964
Exactly.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.207
And it was awesome.

14:21.808 --> 14:25.692
And you look at that and you say that, you know, that could be me.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.274
Could be our ship.

14:27.294 --> 14:27.975
Could be our ship.

14:28.115 --> 14:28.536
Exactly.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.797
Exactly.

14:29.817 --> 14:38.427
I want to go to some photographs right now, just a few that you supplied to us, some pictures and some things also, some of your memorabilia from World War II.

14:38.447 --> 14:40.690
I want to go to some of those and have you talk about them right now.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.373
They'll show up on the screen here.

14:43.792 --> 14:48.578
First off, there is a young sailor, Gene Barber.

14:48.598 --> 14:49.900
About when was this picture taken?

14:50.741 --> 14:52.424
It had to be taken about 1943.

14:52.444 --> 15:02.257
Yeah, and that was, were you already on the Corregidor at that time?

15:02.337 --> 15:04.940
I was on the Corregidor when that was taken.

15:04.961 --> 15:05.681
Good-looking sailor.

15:06.222 --> 15:07.143
All right, let's move on.

15:07.724 --> 15:09.567
Now you all are having a little refreshment.

15:09.587 --> 15:12.771
Yeah, that's me on the way over on the, I guess, the right-hand side.

15:12.791 --> 15:13.512
On the right side, uh-huh.

15:13.897 --> 15:16.300
And yeah, we were partaking there.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.621
That was in San Diego?

15:17.801 --> 15:18.322
San Diego.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.223
Right.

15:19.243 --> 15:20.764
I think that was at the spinning wheel.

15:20.784 --> 15:26.490
I'm not sure, but we went to two or three clubs there, the Rainbow and the spinning wheel.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.932
Gene, you're smiling.

15:27.952 --> 15:32.136
That looks like that might not have been your first beer at the time.

15:32.977 --> 15:34.959
Okay, let's move on.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.261
There's the Corregidor.

15:36.301 --> 15:37.322
That is the Corregidor.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.417
Quite a carrier.

15:40.437 --> 15:41.078
Beautiful ship.

15:41.158 --> 15:42.820
It had twin 20s and twin 40s.

15:43.441 --> 15:48.026
And on the fan tail, we had a five-inch gun.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.711
And that was all the armor that they had.

15:51.731 --> 15:56.477
And the deck, the flight decks were made out of plank.

15:57.097 --> 15:58.379
Wood, just wooden flight decks.

15:59.761 --> 16:04.707
And they could steam about 19 knots at top speed.

16:05.067 --> 16:08.271
And they had to go into the wind if the...

16:08.690 --> 16:16.702
If we were carrying loaded planes, if they were launching loaded planes, you almost had steam in the wind to get enough altitude, you know, when they launched them.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.227
And it would carry a crew of 860 officers and men.

16:20.247 --> 16:20.447
Right.

16:20.487 --> 16:22.210
Displacement of 7,800 tons.

16:23.792 --> 16:28.779
You can imagine with a crew of 800 and something, and you have 600 and something that you lost.

16:28.799 --> 16:33.687
That's the biggest loss of any one ship except the Arizona.

16:33.907 --> 16:35.389
Right, right.

16:36.112 --> 16:37.814
All right, let's move on.

16:37.834 --> 16:45.423
Here is the crew of the Corregidor, and you are in the second row, or the first row is second from the left, I believe.

16:45.443 --> 16:46.104
That's right.

16:46.284 --> 16:47.005
Over on the end.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.969
On the left side, second from the left, that's you.

16:51.571 --> 16:53.794
That's on the flight deck of the USS Corregidor.

16:53.814 --> 16:54.074
Right.

16:54.374 --> 16:54.855
Now, R.L.

16:54.895 --> 16:55.876
Bowman was the captain.

16:55.936 --> 16:57.078
Is he in that picture?

16:57.098 --> 16:57.518
No, sir.

16:57.538 --> 16:58.199
He's not in there.

16:58.559 --> 16:58.659
Okay.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.661
This was after that.

16:59.681 --> 17:01.383
These are mostly chiefs that's in there.

17:01.403 --> 17:01.523
I see.

17:02.124 --> 17:02.444
I see.

17:04.006 --> 17:04.887
It's a good-looking crew.

17:06.065 --> 17:11.236
That's me and a friend of mine from Bremont, Texas, named McMahon.

17:11.857 --> 17:13.160
You're on the right with the dark glasses.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.608
That's me with the dark glasses and the rolled up britches.

17:17.690 --> 17:18.792
That wasn't reg, was it?

17:18.933 --> 17:19.834
No, it wasn't reg.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.023
Walking down the streets of Honolulu.

17:24.284 --> 17:24.765
Honolulu.

17:25.387 --> 17:31.696
Here's the four medals that represent the four major battles that you were in, also your dog tags and the ribbons that go with the medals.

17:32.117 --> 17:32.557
Right.

17:32.577 --> 17:37.244
So from the top row there from left to right, do you know what medals those are?

17:37.264 --> 17:42.992
Well, there's the American campaign and the Asiatic Pacific and one other.

17:43.032 --> 17:44.033
I forget what the other one is.

17:46.377 --> 17:46.897
Victory medal.

17:47.038 --> 17:47.538
Victory medal.

17:47.999 --> 17:48.720
There you go.

17:48.740 --> 17:50.162
And, of course, good conduct.

17:51.391 --> 17:57.061
I want you to tell us a story about the time when you had a leave of 14 days and what happened.

17:57.362 --> 18:03.213
When we came back from Chihuahua making the middle making, we came into Pearl Harbor and they sent us right on to the States.

18:03.934 --> 18:07.601
We tied up in San Diego and I got a 14 day leave.

18:07.801 --> 18:08.603
Right.

18:08.623 --> 18:10.807
Happy to get, you know, out and going.

18:10.827 --> 18:14.293
I had enough money saved up that I could buy an airplane ticket and I did.

18:14.830 --> 18:18.815
And we got on the plane and got as far as Phoenix, Arizona.

18:19.375 --> 18:26.303
And in Phoenix, Arizona, they put us off the plane, displaced us because somebody had a higher priority than we did.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.045
I think it was cadets that they were training.

18:28.686 --> 18:31.650
You know, in those days, you had a priority for everything, you know.

18:32.350 --> 18:36.115
And when I got off the plane, they said, we'll pick you up the next morning and you come back.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.037
We'll give you another another ship to go on.

18:38.843 --> 18:41.186
And so we partied that night.

18:41.287 --> 18:50.660
And if you've ever, well, I know you haven't, but if you ever wore a pair of Navy breeches, Navy pants, everything, you don't have any pockets.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.541
Right.

18:51.561 --> 18:58.011
So you fold everything and put it in your belt like this and then pull your jumper back over it.

18:58.031 --> 19:07.905
And I went home and went back to the hotel after we had been partying and got up the next morning and I didn't have my leave papers.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.402
I had my plane ticket.

19:09.442 --> 19:11.567
I had everything I needed except those leave papers.

19:12.268 --> 19:13.691
And I knew I'd lost them somewhere.

19:14.773 --> 19:20.224
And the friend that I was traveling with came off the same ship that I did and had a set of leave papers.

19:20.244 --> 19:24.934
And I said, I know I can't get by MPs unless I have some leave papers.

19:24.954 --> 19:27.379
So I took a typewriter, rented a typewriter,

19:28.118 --> 19:35.655
Got in there, and I typed up a whole new set of lead papers for Thomas E. Gene Barber off the USS Corregidor.

19:35.736 --> 19:37.079
Oh, my.

19:37.099 --> 19:43.714
And I signed Roscoe L. Bowman, who was the captain of our ship, to the bottom of those lead papers.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.289
It's been over 60 years now.

19:45.309 --> 19:45.810
I think you're okay.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.572
It's been a long time, and I think I'm probably all right.

19:48.995 --> 19:52.200
But I went home, and on the way, they look good.

19:52.220 --> 19:57.388
Honestly, they looked as good as the guy that I copied them off of.

19:57.408 --> 20:03.397
It was the same, but it was a pretty big thing to do to sign your captain's name to your leave papers.

20:03.577 --> 20:03.858
Right.

20:04.379 --> 20:11.890
Voted them, got on the plane, come on back, and avoided every MP I could see at Dallas Airport.

20:12.211 --> 20:12.351
Uh-huh.

20:12.820 --> 20:37.242
and i was still kind of kind of skittish so i caught that old inner urban that used to go from dallas down to waco right because i thought well that's there won't be nobody on that road to waco and then i highwayed it from waco to bremont right about three mornings after that i was sleeping late and mother came in woke me up said gene said the postmaster is here and he wants to talk to you so i got up and went

20:37.593 --> 20:43.420
I knew Mr. Alfred Clark and grew up, you know, knowing him all my life and his daughter went to school with me.

20:44.441 --> 20:51.911
And Mr. Clark was a big joker anyway, but he came and he said, Gene said, they've called me and they say that you're AWOL.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.335
And I said, Mr. Clark, I'm not AWOL.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.479
I know I've got leave till, you know, time to get back to the ship.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.002
He said, well, do you have some leave papers?

21:02.112 --> 21:06.399
And I was scared to show him those fake leaf papers.

21:06.419 --> 21:07.721
I said, yes, sir, I got some.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.628
But he says, well, I've got some too.

21:12.648 --> 21:23.665
He said, somebody in Phoenix, Arizona picked these leaf papers up off the street and saw that you were coming to Bremond and said they sent them to airmail.

21:24.455 --> 21:27.579
to bring him on postmaster and said, I brought him over here to you.

21:28.541 --> 21:31.044
One of the kindest things that ever happened to him.

21:31.084 --> 21:32.026
He was a real friend.

21:32.126 --> 21:33.708
And whoever picked him up.

21:33.728 --> 21:38.435
And the postmaster was just trying to pull one over on you on the AWOL just to see what you would say.

21:40.558 --> 21:44.023
I often wondered, you know, how I got back or if I got caught getting back.

21:44.283 --> 21:44.523
Right.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.806
Because I had real ones and I had to show them going back.

21:47.067 --> 21:47.948
Right, right.

21:47.928 --> 21:57.940
Your service was over and eventually you also, I want you to talk just briefly about the USS Oglethorpe because eventually you went to that boat.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.662
That was an AK-100 landing craft.

21:59.702 --> 22:00.182
Right.

22:00.202 --> 22:00.663
Right.

22:00.683 --> 22:01.944
Talk just a little bit about that boat.

22:01.965 --> 22:10.915
Well, after Guam, Saipan, and Tinian, we came off the Corregidor and I flew back from Pearl Harbor that time all the way to Oakland, California.

22:10.895 --> 22:16.480
And for a short time, I ran, helped with MPs.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.122
I was a first-class petty officer by then.

22:18.142 --> 22:22.806
And, you know, they give you a little better deal than to do when you just got one red stripe.

22:23.567 --> 22:26.810
Anyway, we got all the way back to Texas for 14 days.

22:26.890 --> 22:33.216
And then I went, had to report into new construction in Kearney, New Jersey.

22:33.236 --> 22:37.720
And Kearney, New Jersey is, well, close to New York City.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.100
Right.

22:38.755 --> 22:41.759
And for a while I was stationed at Pier 92 in New York City.

22:41.779 --> 22:48.849
And the year that President Roosevelt died, I was in a parade down Fifth Avenue.

22:49.049 --> 22:49.570
In New York City.

22:49.590 --> 22:50.391
In New York City.

22:50.411 --> 22:50.911
Right.

22:50.931 --> 22:55.498
And Pier 92 was, the famous ship was tied up, the next pier over.

22:55.718 --> 22:55.978
Right.

22:56.198 --> 23:00.384
Was the USS Constitution, Old Ironsides.

23:00.644 --> 23:00.905
Right.

23:01.085 --> 23:03.328
Old Ironsides was there.

23:03.308 --> 23:06.153
And we always said that she was a ground on coffee grounds.

23:06.693 --> 23:08.937
She was sitting there so long, throwing the coffee over.

23:08.957 --> 23:16.329
But the new assignment was the best duty that I ever had.

23:16.609 --> 23:17.130
Indeed it was.

23:17.471 --> 23:21.057
There's so much more to your career, and there's so much more after your career.

23:21.137 --> 23:28.368
You sold cars, you sold lumber, you carried the mail, and you were the sheriff of Burleson County for some seven years after that.

23:28.388 --> 23:29.350
It was more than seven.

23:29.802 --> 23:30.383
It was 11.

23:30.403 --> 23:34.768
11 years, yes, as you were the sheriff of Burleson County.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.130
I got the pleasure of being in your home the other day.

23:37.150 --> 23:43.958
And I tell you what, before we talk about this, we've got a guest here that I want her to come on and join us here on the set.

23:44.018 --> 23:45.039
You don't know about this.

23:45.940 --> 23:50.485
But I want you to tell me about your love of Bob Wills.

23:50.505 --> 23:51.987
And then I want to introduce you.

23:52.327 --> 23:53.028
Ann, have a seat.

23:53.328 --> 23:54.269
This is Ann Black.

23:54.770 --> 23:58.594
Ann is the executive director of MSC Opus here.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.904
You are a lover of Bob Wills.

24:01.924 --> 24:02.925
How did that come all about?

24:02.965 --> 24:11.298
Well, when I was in high school, one of the first times that I heard... In Bremont, Texas, I walked back and forth to school.

24:11.318 --> 24:13.661
And I had walked down Highway 6 and 14.

24:13.721 --> 24:16.666
There was a cafe there, Eli Cafe.

24:16.686 --> 24:20.792
The first time I heard Bob Wills and Texas Playboys was in that cafe.

24:21.152 --> 24:22.815
And they were playing San Antonio Rose.

24:23.576 --> 24:27.121
The newest record of San Antonio Rose.

24:27.141 --> 24:27.822
And it was...

24:28.139 --> 24:30.683
Not, didn't have words.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.504
It was the old one.

24:31.865 --> 24:33.848
And I thought, Lord, that is beautiful music.

24:34.589 --> 24:38.675
And that was the first time that I, you know, really appreciated.

24:39.156 --> 24:51.054
And then when they put words to it and put the band together and made the big band, and they had the big band sound on the new San Antonio roads, then it really helped these people play.

24:51.835 --> 24:54.600
They can really play.

24:54.780 --> 24:54.940
And

24:55.409 --> 25:00.383
All the time that I was growing up, we played Bob Will's music, you know, and listened to it.

25:00.885 --> 25:06.220
Well, I'll tell you what, as a matter of fact, in your home, you have a mini museum of Bob Will's memorabilia.

25:06.281 --> 25:10.212
And Anne Black wants to make your love of

25:10.546 --> 25:12.108
Bob Wills a little bit more special.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.571
Ann, what have we got?

25:13.751 --> 25:17.056
Mr. Barber, thank you, first of all, for your service to this country.

25:17.697 --> 25:21.503
My daddy taught me to dance to San Antonio Rose.

25:21.783 --> 25:27.492
This is a gift certificate for two tickets for A Ride with Bob, the Bob Wills Musical.

25:28.012 --> 25:33.402
Now, of course, it isn't Bob Wills and his playboys, but it's Ray Benson and Asleep at the Wheel.

25:33.622 --> 25:37.208
If you're not familiar with them, they do justice to Bob Wills.

25:37.268 --> 25:39.492
Oh, I'm familiar with them.

25:39.512 --> 25:43.479
We hope you'll come and enjoy a little trip down memory lane.

25:44.080 --> 25:44.461
Good.

25:44.481 --> 25:46.645
And thank you for sharing your memories with us.

25:47.401 --> 25:49.343
This is wonderful.

25:49.363 --> 25:50.524
This is really wonderful.

25:51.004 --> 25:52.065
Bob didn't know about this.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.648
I mean, excuse me, Jean didn't know about this.

25:54.688 --> 25:56.650
And Ann, thank you for doing this.

25:56.710 --> 25:59.533
I know it's a pleasure for you all to do this.

25:59.593 --> 26:01.715
And the date for this particular performance?

26:01.735 --> 26:03.156
It's February 1st or 2nd.

26:03.496 --> 26:09.442
You can pick your date and take the gift certificate to the box office sometime in August or September is early enough.

26:09.582 --> 26:10.703
It's not until February.

26:11.104 --> 26:11.724
Okay.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.746
Decide which night you'd like to come.

26:13.726 --> 26:14.607
That is great.

26:15.628 --> 26:31.262
I mean to tell you, when I worked for the post office, I was the state steward for a long time, and I hunted all about, that's before Benson and any of them started doing, redoing, you know, before it was rejuvenating.

26:31.282 --> 26:41.792
And I've got all, I had all kinds of old, white records that Bob Wills, I go to all the music places that fix, you know, jukeboxes, and pick them up.

26:42.498 --> 26:47.883
And I went all over state, and I picked up a lot of good ones, and some that these people don't even know about.

26:47.943 --> 26:48.624
I've got two.

26:49.285 --> 26:53.629
And you've got some great stories, and we're out of time right now, but I want you to enjoy the play.

26:53.729 --> 26:55.011
Thank you very much for your service.

26:55.031 --> 26:55.791
I really appreciate that.

26:55.811 --> 26:56.692
You bet, and thank you, Ann.

26:57.633 --> 27:00.756
Gene Barber and his wife, Doris, have been married more than 60 years.

27:00.796 --> 27:04.160
They have a daughter and a son, three grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren.

27:04.220 --> 27:07.143
He's rightly proud of them, and we're proud of his service.

27:07.163 --> 27:08.884
We salute him, and we salute all veterans.

27:09.225 --> 27:12.488
And we invite you to join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:26.963 --> 27:31.962
