00:07.220 --> 00:31.310
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.451
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.140 --> 00:39.468
When we first started Veterans of the Valley a few months back, it was my plan to introduce you to my friend Al Hanson early on.

00:39.488 --> 00:43.233
Well, different problems came up, but now, finally, you get to meet Uncle Al.

00:44.034 --> 00:49.941
It's on his and Ruby's back porch in Bryan that I first started my passion for telling the story of Brazos Valley veterans.

00:50.462 --> 00:53.546
It was on that back porch that I met Glenn Morgan, Dr. J.F.

00:53.566 --> 00:54.507
Cooper, W.S.

00:54.627 --> 00:56.089
Edmonds, Sonny Franze.

00:56.369 --> 00:57.370
All have been guests here.

00:58.011 --> 01:01.155
And there, I met many other proud members of the greatest generation.

01:01.135 --> 01:08.486
And it was there I first heard the story of Sergeant Al Tex Hansen, radio operator of the 55th Troop Carrier Squadron, U.S.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.207
Army Air Corps.

01:09.969 --> 01:19.042
Al Hansen has lost count of how many missions he flew in World War II, his craft delivering supplies to the troops on practically every island of the Pacific Campaign.

01:19.443 --> 01:20.765
Al, what a pleasure it is to have you here.

01:20.785 --> 01:22.688
I've been wanting to have you here for a long time.

01:22.887 --> 01:24.589
And finally, by golly, we made it.

01:25.070 --> 01:30.779
We got to move along because there's so much to your story, but I want to go to radio operator school in South Dakota.

01:30.879 --> 01:33.523
That's the first time that you experienced flying in an airplane.

01:33.883 --> 01:35.385
And that's the first time you really got scared.

01:35.425 --> 01:36.126
Talk about that.

01:36.447 --> 01:44.659
Went to radio school in South Dakota and school was 24 hours a day, eight, three shifts, eight hours a day.

01:44.679 --> 01:46.101
They wanted radio operators.

01:47.203 --> 01:47.443
Well,

01:47.913 --> 01:49.355
I finally graduated.

01:49.755 --> 01:51.738
I had to take about 16 words a minute.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.260
That's how you graduate.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.201
A lot of them flunked out.

01:54.221 --> 01:56.003
They didn't want to be radio operators.

01:56.023 --> 01:57.245
Well, I didn't want to at first.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.348
So, okay.

02:00.309 --> 02:01.991
Also in mechanics, I got two degrees.

02:02.151 --> 02:04.334
One in mechanics and one in radio.

02:04.354 --> 02:09.400
Well, before you could get your degrees, well, you had to fly.

02:10.061 --> 02:11.663
Let's do go for it.

02:12.404 --> 02:15.388
Went out to this little airport there, and there was this Piper Cub.

02:16.145 --> 02:19.656
and they were made out of cloth and shellacked, that's all it was.

02:19.817 --> 02:21.562
The wings, sides, everything.

02:22.144 --> 02:27.100
So I got in there and I had my little table there about radio deals, so I had to call into the base

02:27.181 --> 02:29.364
And they'd call me back to check me out and everything.

02:29.444 --> 02:31.627
So we got about 4,000 or 5,000 feet.

02:31.688 --> 02:33.430
Boy, the South Dakota is beautiful.

02:33.711 --> 02:35.754
All these red borns and cattle and stuff.

02:36.254 --> 02:39.880
And this pilot said, if they didn't know your name, they called you Soldier.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.443
Soldier, do you see any planes out there or anything?

02:43.104 --> 02:44.046
No, sir, I don't see any.

02:44.627 --> 02:46.109
Well, you know, I had my safety belt on.

02:46.649 --> 02:48.893
He took that plane and did a complete flip.

02:50.094 --> 02:51.296
And when we straightened out.

02:51.577 --> 02:52.698
He didn't tell you he was going to do this.

02:52.818 --> 02:53.139
No.

02:53.820 --> 02:53.880
No.

02:53.995 --> 02:54.415
No.

02:54.876 --> 02:56.538
Man, my hands were almost bleeding.

02:57.059 --> 02:58.320
Got my fingers like that.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.264
I said, man, I wish I'd have stayed on the farm.

03:01.364 --> 03:02.925
You know, just scared me.

03:05.368 --> 03:09.834
That was your first experience with Clyde, but you were going to have a whole lot more when World War II came along.

03:10.054 --> 03:15.080
The next day, we went to the building there, and they pinned my medals on my wings right there.

03:15.180 --> 03:18.063
They put the wings on me, and so you're in the Air Corps.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.665
You're flying.

03:20.337 --> 03:23.020
In the Air Corps, like you get base pay is $80.

03:23.421 --> 03:25.803
But if you're flying, you get 50% more.

03:25.824 --> 03:28.507
So that's, that's what, $40 more.

03:28.707 --> 03:28.967
Right.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.549
But okay, go ahead.

03:30.569 --> 03:32.231
What's the next question?

03:32.251 --> 03:32.872
I'm waiting.

03:32.892 --> 03:33.372
You went ahead.

03:33.392 --> 03:34.594
You went on to Denver.

03:34.654 --> 03:35.735
You were in Ogden, Utah.

03:35.755 --> 03:37.457
Then you got the good news that you were going to go back to Texas.

03:37.477 --> 03:39.460
Well, let me tell that about Ogden, Utah.

03:39.480 --> 03:39.740
Okay.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.701
Ogden, Utah.

03:40.941 --> 03:42.483
Cold and ice.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.666
The Mormon people there were nice.

03:45.507 --> 03:47.649
So every day I'd go look at that bulletin board.

03:48.370 --> 03:49.011
There it was.

03:49.278 --> 03:55.147
Alfredo Hanson, Baytown, I mean, pardon, Austin, Texas, Del Valley.

03:55.167 --> 03:55.608
Bergstrom.

03:55.628 --> 03:56.569
Bergstrom Field.

03:56.650 --> 03:57.751
You're going back home to Texas.

03:57.992 --> 03:59.975
Boy, tears came in my eyes.

04:00.355 --> 04:01.397
It had gone for months.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.263
And they gave me a 14-day delay in route to get there.

04:05.844 --> 04:11.573
So I went to Baytown, married my beautiful wife, Ruby Novosad, May Novosad.

04:12.454 --> 04:17.462
And so they took me back to the base, to Bergstrom, got me there at midnight.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.012
And I showed the guard my papers.

04:20.052 --> 04:23.477
He took me right in there and said, you want to go to the mess hall first?

04:23.497 --> 04:24.899
Or you want to go to the barracks?

04:24.959 --> 04:26.101
I said, well, I'll go eat something.

04:26.582 --> 04:27.623
Walked in that mess hall.

04:27.663 --> 04:33.231
There was a bunch of soldiers over, officers, everybody in the corner, about 25 or 30.

04:33.852 --> 04:38.298
So I got me a plate, went up there, and the guy said, the cook said, how do you want your eggs?

04:39.520 --> 04:39.921
Bad.

04:40.702 --> 04:42.184
I said, over easy.

04:44.408 --> 04:46.570
I went to the next guy, you want a hamburger or bacon?

04:46.590 --> 04:47.932
You hadn't been treated this nice before.

04:47.952 --> 04:48.973
Oh, my God, no.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.737
And, man, I was going to sign up for 20 more years.

04:53.978 --> 04:55.800
And coffee and jelly and everything.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.542
So I sat there by these guys just listening.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.046
And this MP that brought me up here, he stayed with me.

05:01.667 --> 05:04.470
And they started talking about, they just got back from flying.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.591
Hell, it was at midnight.

05:06.512 --> 05:07.233
I said, all right.

05:07.673 --> 05:10.416
So he took me to the base the next day.

05:11.206 --> 05:14.109
I said, okay, you checked your record, Hanson, you're going to start flying.

05:14.369 --> 05:15.009
Oh, boy.

05:16.411 --> 05:16.971
What did I do?

05:17.672 --> 05:20.414
They put me pulling those gliders.

05:20.434 --> 05:22.056
Well, I know radio communications.

05:22.276 --> 05:23.237
We pull those gliders.

05:23.577 --> 05:25.398
You got pictures over here in the show in a minute.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.141
And, boy, that was scary.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.323
You get that glider off.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.805
The rope would stretch about 10 foot.

05:33.666 --> 05:34.246
Here we go.

05:34.446 --> 05:38.590
And, boy, when it tightened up, that plane would slow down at C-47.

05:39.831 --> 05:40.892
It slowed down.

05:41.530 --> 05:45.937
And boy, he'd rev those engines, and we'd finally get it off.

05:45.957 --> 05:49.342
We'd circle, you know, LaGrange, Bastrop, circle.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.066
And they had a big circle out there with these planes laying.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.192
And over the side was just bunches of them that had been crashed.

05:56.613 --> 06:01.260
But every one we pulled, every glider we pulled, landed right in that circle.

06:02.540 --> 06:05.243
But you preferred the motorized aircraft, right?

06:05.583 --> 06:06.424
Oh, yeah.

06:06.464 --> 06:08.386
We got some pictures to show later.

06:09.408 --> 06:12.391
You went on to Pathfinder School, I know, in Indianapolis.

06:12.411 --> 06:12.932
That's right.

06:13.012 --> 06:16.495
Let's fast forward to when you went over to the Pacific.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.240
You went to Hawaii first, right?

06:20.260 --> 06:20.360
Yeah.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.501
Let me tell you about California.

06:21.601 --> 06:22.382
Oh, yeah.

06:22.402 --> 06:26.166
I got in line there, going to the mess hall, and this guy was right behind me.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.610
And I looked at him and, man, he looked bad.

06:30.822 --> 06:32.624
He said, you're probably going to the Pacific.

06:32.764 --> 06:34.045
I said, I sure am.

06:34.065 --> 06:35.647
He said, well, I just got back.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.148
Look at here.

06:36.668 --> 06:38.470
His fingernails were started black.

06:40.012 --> 06:41.893
And his face was yellow from taking the alibi.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.016
Then he said, you ought to see my feet.

06:44.216 --> 06:45.938
I said, no, I've seen enough.

06:45.958 --> 06:49.902
Boy, that's when I said, I wish I'd have never signed up.

06:50.042 --> 06:50.863
That scared me.

06:51.724 --> 06:52.705
So we got on the C-54.

06:52.845 --> 06:53.806
We went to Hawaii.

06:53.866 --> 06:57.149
From Hawaii, Johnson Island, to Rawa.

06:57.169 --> 06:58.491
To Rawa was bad.

06:58.591 --> 06:59.732
It was all shot up.

07:00.235 --> 07:04.200
And just before we landed in Tarawa, the pilot told us it was on the C-54.

07:04.521 --> 07:11.951
He said, coming in to Tarawa, just before you get to all these islands, there's just beautiful palm trees, just beautiful.

07:12.371 --> 07:17.518
But boy, when we landed in Tarawa, it was shot up ever.

07:17.539 --> 07:18.720
We lost a lot of troops there.

07:19.101 --> 07:19.942
Indeed, indeed.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.864
And then Guadalcanal.

07:22.045 --> 07:23.006
Go ahead.

07:23.667 --> 07:23.967
Let's see.

07:24.308 --> 07:27.492
Guadalcanal, then New Guinea.

07:29.446 --> 07:30.768
I think, there we go.

07:30.888 --> 07:32.070
We got a map right now.

07:32.090 --> 07:33.653
This is your map, actually.

07:34.254 --> 07:40.204
And it's a little bit hard to see right here on television, but this is a map of the islands, the Philippines.

07:41.046 --> 07:47.196
And the red arrow that you see is pretty much your route where you went.

07:48.198 --> 07:51.604
And you just flew and flew and flew and flew as a radio operator.

07:51.624 --> 07:53.547
You spent more time in the air than on the ground, right?

07:53.567 --> 07:54.188
That is right.

07:55.822 --> 08:03.633
Talk about, Al, exactly what your job was as a radio operator in World War II.

08:03.753 --> 08:05.235
What was involved in that?

08:05.255 --> 08:05.655
All right, sir.

08:07.217 --> 08:12.444
On the bulletin board, they'd say, they'd have the names there, where you're going and what plane you're going on.

08:12.464 --> 08:13.746
And I always did this.

08:13.886 --> 08:14.748
I carried my .45.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.530
I carried a compass.

08:17.131 --> 08:19.934
I carried a knife and a cigarette lighter.

08:20.836 --> 08:24.040
I carried that religiously when I get on that plane.

08:24.863 --> 08:26.946
And the pilot never did have to say, buckle up.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.248
I knew better than that.

08:28.628 --> 08:30.311
I'd always buckle up.

08:30.331 --> 08:39.183
And as soon as I'd get airborne, when we leave the ground, all it was was voice modulation, the pilot talking to the tire.

08:39.464 --> 08:44.170
But once we got airborne and settled out, that's when I got on the radio.

08:44.451 --> 08:47.215
I called the base, tell them where we're going.

08:48.436 --> 08:50.459
And then they gave me paper to look at.

08:51.341 --> 08:52.763
It's all by key now.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.465
Just by the key.

08:55.947 --> 08:57.669
We'll tell that story in a minute.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.810
Go ahead.

08:58.890 --> 08:59.931
I did it.

08:59.951 --> 09:02.833
And the earphones on and nobody bothered you.

09:03.013 --> 09:06.637
You had your own little table on your desk, your radio up here.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.618
The tubes were that big, that big around.

09:09.379 --> 09:10.460
That's what they had back then.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.263
And I'd call into the base.

09:14.183 --> 09:19.869
Then I'd call where we were going, our destination.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.773
And I'd always get the latitude and longitude from the navigator.

09:25.259 --> 09:26.300
There's five in the crew.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.063
And he'd give me that information.

09:29.823 --> 09:37.691
Then I'd call in number of the plane, a longitude, latitude, and ETA, estimated time of arrival.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.572
I was thrilled then.

09:38.852 --> 09:40.033
And that was your job?

09:40.053 --> 09:40.694
Yes, sir.

09:40.714 --> 09:46.459
I want to take a look at a young Al Hansen and describe this picture that we're showing right here.

09:46.519 --> 09:50.503
This is your crew in front of your aircraft.

09:50.583 --> 09:55.047
You're the one, I believe, kneeling down on the left as we're looking at that, right?

09:56.123 --> 09:56.964
Talk about that picture.

09:56.984 --> 09:57.645
When was it taken?

09:59.347 --> 09:59.868
Do you recall?

10:00.589 --> 10:01.991
Probably in 43, I guess.

10:02.792 --> 10:06.336
When you were in flight training school, or was this already over in the Pacific?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.598
No, that's in flight training.

10:07.818 --> 10:08.659
In flight training school.

10:08.679 --> 10:08.760
Yes.

10:09.260 --> 10:14.888
And that's young Sergeant Al Hanson on the bottom on the left side as we're looking.

10:14.908 --> 10:16.269
Do you remember who any of those other folks were?

10:16.289 --> 10:16.470
Yes, sir.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.372
The guy behind me is Captain Al Kemp.

10:18.392 --> 10:23.178
He was from Austin, Texas, and he always favored me because we were both Texans.

10:23.379 --> 10:23.599
Right.

10:23.883 --> 10:28.428
And the other one was a pilot, I mean, a co-pilot, one on the right outside.

10:29.149 --> 10:30.190
He was our navigator.

10:30.270 --> 10:33.213
He was a Jewish fella, and we liked it.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.534
He was really smart.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.056
Man, he was intelligent.

10:36.076 --> 10:37.918
The other one on the bottom was named Frank Dirk.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.620
He lived in New York City.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.420
He was the mechanic.

10:40.641 --> 10:45.305
The mechanic on the plane.

10:45.526 --> 10:46.727
Right, right, right, right, right.

10:47.067 --> 10:53.434
Want to give people an idea a little bit of a better look at the kind of plane that you were a radio operator on.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.567
I think we've got a photograph here.

10:55.587 --> 10:56.028
There we go.

10:56.268 --> 10:57.870
I'm holding it.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.251
That was the planes you flew on mostly.

10:59.291 --> 10:59.652
Is that right?

10:59.692 --> 11:00.132
Yes, sir.

11:00.192 --> 11:00.993
I love that plane.

11:01.013 --> 11:01.514
That's a 47.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.056
The other was a 46.

11:03.376 --> 11:05.739
And this hauled everything.

11:05.759 --> 11:13.848
I mean, you all took supplies to R-Truth, just about everything except bombs you took.

11:13.948 --> 11:14.789
No, 50 caliber.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.972
We hauled cases and cases of 50 caliber.

11:17.432 --> 11:19.214
We hauled Japanese printers.

11:19.234 --> 11:21.717
And when they'd get on that plane, they'd be shackled at the feet.

11:22.287 --> 11:24.449
the hands behind them, and would they bow?

11:24.469 --> 11:26.251
Man, they never had any back trouble.

11:26.451 --> 11:29.134
Boy, they could just bow and bow before we'd put them on the plane.

11:29.434 --> 11:30.415
Then we'd haul nurses.

11:31.216 --> 11:31.857
Ammunition.

11:32.618 --> 11:33.879
We like that hauling nurses.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.061
Really, yeah.

11:36.762 --> 11:37.963
You like that part of it.

11:38.043 --> 11:38.904
What else did you take?

11:38.924 --> 11:40.245
You took a lot of stuff.

11:40.265 --> 11:41.987
As a matter of fact, I'm going to say some numbers here.

11:42.007 --> 11:43.989
Jeeps, ammunition, just you name it.

11:44.229 --> 11:45.851
Baggages.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.873
Oh man, whatever there was.

11:48.494 --> 11:49.635
I want to give people an idea.

11:49.655 --> 11:52.978
I'm looking at a commendation that's dated May the 30th, 1945.

11:54.099 --> 11:55.581
And it was for your squadron.

11:55.621 --> 11:56.702
And listen to these numbers.

11:56.722 --> 12:15.160
This is what, during the month of March, 1945, in one month's time, during that month, operating out of San Marcelino, the airplanes of the 55th Troop Carrier, that was your troop, your squadron, lifted a total of 10,319,000 pounds of cargo in one month.

12:15.832 --> 12:32.416
including 368,000 passenger pounds, 9,951,000 freight pounds on a total of 1,280 individual flights involving a daily average of 15 different available types of airplanes.

12:33.557 --> 12:38.705
So when I say that you were actually in the air more than you were in the ground, I'm not really exaggerating.

12:38.945 --> 12:43.171
The only time I'd get scared is that taken off and landed.

12:43.572 --> 12:43.712
Mm-hmm.

12:44.283 --> 12:45.004
You're loaded.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.629
The freight might, the jeeps or something might shift.

12:48.989 --> 12:50.692
Sometimes they did.

12:50.712 --> 12:52.134
But I was always buckling.

12:52.154 --> 12:54.717
Every time I take off, I do the sign of the cross.

12:55.758 --> 12:57.841
And when I landed, I did the sign of the cross.

12:58.722 --> 13:00.244
Scared me.

13:00.264 --> 13:00.645
Really?

13:00.865 --> 13:02.548
Talk about how you knew you were going to fly.

13:02.668 --> 13:04.090
They put towels on the tent.

13:04.190 --> 13:05.131
Oh, wait a minute.

13:05.632 --> 13:05.892
Yeah.

13:05.952 --> 13:06.833
And they're squattering.

13:06.873 --> 13:10.358
If you're going to fly, you look at the bulletin board and you put a towel on your tent.

13:10.810 --> 13:12.153
Then you put a towel on your bed.

13:12.273 --> 13:13.436
It's about 4 o'clock in the morning.

13:13.456 --> 13:21.474
Here comes this guy with a flashlight to wake you up, and you go over and eat dehydrated potatoes, dehydrated milk.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.280
Everything was dehydrated.

13:24.952 --> 13:27.035
And sometimes you had that stuff on the shingle.

13:27.055 --> 13:29.418
These guys know what I'm talking about, stuff on the shingle.

13:29.899 --> 13:30.540
Right.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.482
Yeah, everything wasn't great to eat.

13:32.543 --> 13:33.364
I know that.

13:33.384 --> 13:39.973
And a lot of the supplies that you dropped were dropped by parachute, different colored parachutes for different items that you dropped, right?

13:39.993 --> 13:41.174
I came out one morning.

13:42.156 --> 13:46.001
I came out there, and there was nothing in the plane.

13:46.081 --> 13:46.782
There was nobody there.

13:46.922 --> 13:49.045
I said, we're going to fly in the crew chief.

13:49.085 --> 13:50.527
We always check the plane out.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.410
And here came his truck.

13:52.846 --> 13:54.629
And these guys start throwing off these parachutes.

13:54.769 --> 13:55.710
They're different colors.

13:56.291 --> 14:01.860
I think white was water and red was ammunition and whatever else.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.123
And so they loaded it up.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.527
And I said, well, it's going to be interesting.

14:06.547 --> 14:07.288
We're going to drop these.

14:07.729 --> 14:09.872
The hills are full of Japanese.

14:10.293 --> 14:12.576
What got me with my car that say,

14:13.265 --> 14:14.686
So-and-so is secured.

14:15.567 --> 14:18.811
Boy, that was for the people in America.

14:18.871 --> 14:21.654
Those hills are just full of Japanese.

14:21.954 --> 14:23.576
Yeah, but it was secure.

14:23.756 --> 14:26.599
The airstrip, I never was bombed.

14:26.619 --> 14:28.140
They'd always bomb the Navy over there.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.942
The bombs would come over, but they'd go to the Navy.

14:29.962 --> 14:31.363
They didn't care about the airstrip.

14:32.104 --> 14:37.430
But they had a big foxhole back there, but we'd jump in there and sometimes be a foot of water in there.

14:37.590 --> 14:38.150
We didn't care.

14:38.331 --> 14:39.952
I know one idea of what they call secure.

14:39.972 --> 14:42.715
I believe you were telling me a story about when you went into New Guinea.

14:43.184 --> 14:44.567
and a fellow that was there.

14:44.888 --> 14:47.293
And New Guinea was really, really messed up.

14:47.473 --> 14:49.156
They met a fellow that talked to you.

14:49.998 --> 14:52.002
Oh, well, let me get back to you with the parachute.

14:52.223 --> 14:53.826
I said, man, I thought this was going to be fun.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.253
We went up those mountains and had that door open.

14:57.293 --> 14:59.598
See, that unbalances the plane too.

15:00.580 --> 15:03.927
And these guys got up and they had to run it, run it, tell the pilot.

15:04.328 --> 15:28.750
coming oh you're about 500 feet to the west he'd run back and here we circling and all this time we're right over these hills and the heat waves coming up and down and that plane would be bouncing up and down i mean it was scary right and and oh you're 300 foot to the south just kept circling finally located you couldn't see them solid trees and they just

15:28.915 --> 15:30.417
started throwing out those parachutes.

15:30.998 --> 15:36.325
And one time your plane was coming in and there were some problems, I believe, with the right side, with the right wing?

15:36.646 --> 15:38.028
No, it was the right engine.

15:38.088 --> 15:40.070
It was always going out.

15:40.090 --> 15:42.854
We would come in there with some troops to Manila.

15:42.874 --> 15:44.036
Manila was still on fire.

15:44.176 --> 15:45.178
Not Manila, the bay.

15:45.338 --> 15:46.379
Manila Bay was on fire.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.021
And Manila was burning, too.

15:48.502 --> 15:52.628
So here we come in with these troops and, boy, that's what you love a pilot.

15:53.309 --> 15:55.632
That right engine started coughing and spitting.

15:56.270 --> 15:59.754
Well, it was either Nichols Field or Clark Field.

15:59.774 --> 16:02.918
And there was planes there that patterned.

16:02.938 --> 16:03.839
You have to get in a pattern.

16:04.239 --> 16:08.184
There was V-25, V-51s, and C-47s.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.407
Voice, modulation, he called the tire.

16:12.348 --> 16:14.851
Well, all these pilots were in that same frequency.

16:14.911 --> 16:16.213
They could hear what he was saying.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.554
Look, I got an engine going out.

16:17.614 --> 16:18.415
I got some troops.

16:18.796 --> 16:19.457
I'm coming in.

16:20.077 --> 16:21.219
No, you get in a pattern.

16:21.319 --> 16:22.600
He said, y'all better look out.

16:23.021 --> 16:25.163
Boy, he slipped that plane right in there.

16:26.662 --> 16:28.284
come out and land in that damn thing.

16:28.725 --> 16:34.634
I know one of the groups that you really respect because of what they did at World War II, and we've had guests here that were members of the Navy Seabees.

16:35.195 --> 16:35.636
Oh, yeah.

16:35.836 --> 16:37.779
Talk about the Seabees and the work they did.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.622
You couldn't have done your job without the work that they did.

16:39.642 --> 16:43.067
Oh, man, they worked on those airstrips at night with bulldozers and stuff.

16:43.435 --> 16:48.563
Some planes come over, they just crawl under to get beside it, and we'd head for the foxhole.

16:49.384 --> 16:53.470
Oh, man, and they'd put that metal lattice like he talked about.

16:54.392 --> 17:03.085
What I can't understand, of all these landings we made on coral rock, sand, dirt, and this metal lattice, never had a blowout.

17:03.586 --> 17:04.988
I can't figure that out.

17:05.088 --> 17:06.490
We never had a tire blowout.

17:07.398 --> 17:10.841
Well, that says something for the CBs and the airstrips that they built.

17:10.921 --> 17:13.204
It says something for the tires also, I guess.

17:13.604 --> 17:19.270
The fellow in New Guinea, it was a funny thing that you went to New Guinea and you said, boy, this is really bad around here.

17:19.290 --> 17:20.251
And what did he say to you?

17:21.172 --> 17:22.853
Oh, yeah.

17:23.234 --> 17:24.695
We got off this big old C-54.

17:25.015 --> 17:26.937
We were nice, the uniforms on.

17:27.918 --> 17:31.221
We got off the C-54, just top stuff.

17:31.241 --> 17:33.083
We'd been to Pathfinder School.

17:33.103 --> 17:33.844
We were number one.

17:34.482 --> 17:37.846
Got off and got down there, and we went over to talk to the truck driver.

17:38.647 --> 17:42.712
I said, there's a lot of crashed planes over there.

17:42.732 --> 17:44.634
I said, man, y'all really had it tough.

17:45.315 --> 17:45.595
Tough?

17:46.096 --> 17:48.218
Yeah, you should have been here before we had the Coke machine.

17:48.739 --> 17:49.980
Man, that was crazy.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.126
So another time here, we went to Mindora and Mindanao.

17:55.146 --> 17:56.508
There's two, I get them mixed up.

17:56.548 --> 18:02.835
I get confused on those two, but we had either one and picked up these paratroopers.

18:03.828 --> 18:07.792
And 101's or something like that, I can't remember the name.

18:07.812 --> 18:10.035
We picked those parachutes up, we're gonna take them to Manila.

18:10.115 --> 18:12.197
See, Manila's already been slowed down a lot.

18:13.338 --> 18:19.224
So just before we got to Manila, coming up there was kind of the side of it.

18:19.244 --> 18:23.029
And I was up there where my radio is, and the plane was going like this.

18:23.089 --> 18:25.992
And the pilot said, Texas, what's going on back there?

18:26.312 --> 18:27.253
I went back there.

18:27.908 --> 18:30.171
And these guys said, we dropped on Corregidor.

18:30.772 --> 18:32.275
Oh, he got killed there.

18:32.295 --> 18:33.496
He got shot there.

18:33.516 --> 18:37.262
And I went up and told the pilot, I said, those guys dropped on Corregidor, 101st Airborne.

18:37.723 --> 18:39.525
He said, we're going to show them a show.

18:39.545 --> 18:49.460
Well, he dropped that plane right down, went around this way with it, where they could see out of the window, circled that thing, went the other way, come back there, and they really enjoyed it, 101st Airborne.

18:50.582 --> 18:51.343
Oh, man.

18:51.363 --> 18:56.751
It was towards the end of the war, I know, Al, that you were at Okinawa getting ready for a potential ground

18:57.136 --> 19:00.319
war with Japan, but it was about that time the war ended.

19:01.220 --> 19:06.586
After the war ended, talk about your unit, what it became, and what its job was.

19:06.686 --> 19:12.152
To me, this is very interesting, and a lot of people don't know this part of the history of World War II.

19:12.172 --> 19:12.932
Okay, here we are.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.635
Just planes, we're loaded with troops, we're ready to go.

19:16.056 --> 19:26.907
They gave us a little book, How to Speak Japanese, and I've got some of it written down in that little book, and .45s, knife, and all that, and they

19:27.106 --> 19:30.149
spoke to, don't cause any trouble.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.872
And here we go, we landed Tachikawa airstrip.

19:34.152 --> 19:37.255
I got a gal in Tachikawa, that was the word going around there.

19:37.756 --> 19:43.821
We landed there, and oh, it was shot up, side of the building with 50 caliber holes in them.

19:43.841 --> 19:47.104
And we landed there and got settled down.

19:47.124 --> 19:53.250
And boy, all of a sudden, about six or eight little Japanese kids running around the plane, Sato, Sato, Sato.

19:53.951 --> 19:55.392
Well, I didn't know what that was.

19:55.557 --> 19:57.699
So one of the guys said, that means sugar.

19:58.700 --> 20:02.284
So we went in the plane, busted up two cases, which is illegal.

20:02.644 --> 20:06.568
See, I'm still on duty, so I don't want to get court-martialed.

20:06.589 --> 20:12.775
But we opened that up, gave those kids some sugar, and they just take those cubes of sugar and just throw them in the mouth like that.

20:14.417 --> 20:14.957
And so go ahead.

20:14.977 --> 20:18.661
So your job there was as a part of the Imperial Couriers.

20:18.781 --> 20:19.582
Oh, that came later.

20:19.662 --> 20:20.043
Yeah.

20:20.063 --> 20:20.223
Yeah.

20:20.263 --> 20:21.304
That's what I want you to talk about.

20:21.604 --> 20:22.425
All right.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.246
We made several flights around the island.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.110
Then one day we had a big meeting, said, man, you're no longer.

20:29.851 --> 20:31.954
You are now with an Imperial Courier.

20:31.994 --> 20:34.497
You're with Japanese Airlines.

20:35.458 --> 20:36.099
All right.

20:36.119 --> 20:40.004
So we went out there, and they had painted Imperial Courier on all our airplanes.

20:40.625 --> 20:45.471
And all we cared was Japanese officials to a different island, Korea.

20:45.491 --> 20:50.578
I had a chance to go to Hong Kong and Singapore, but they had my name on the wall, discharged.

20:51.319 --> 20:52.480
I said, no way.

20:52.612 --> 20:55.456
We're looking at a photograph right now to talk about what we're talking about.

20:55.597 --> 20:56.698
Yeah, that's at Okinawa.

20:56.718 --> 20:58.641
This is similar to what you're talking about.

20:58.681 --> 21:06.573
This is a plane similar to yours, and it looks like a group of Japanese businessmen that this plane is about to transport right after the war is over.

21:06.593 --> 21:07.334
They're going to Manila.

21:07.354 --> 21:08.035
The war is over.

21:08.115 --> 21:09.758
They landed that plane right there at Okinawa.

21:10.138 --> 21:15.126
Those guys are going to Manila to talk to the boss, boss, MacArthur.

21:15.730 --> 21:26.130
And these are the type of folks that you would transport, and so you were essentially part of... The guys we carried all had suits on just like on the Missouri, had caps on and hats.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.552
They really dressed nice.

21:27.692 --> 21:28.173
Right.

21:28.193 --> 21:31.059
And the Japanese were very kind to you.

21:31.099 --> 21:32.682
Oh, man, they would bow all the time.

21:33.023 --> 21:37.030
I've got to say one more thing about when I was at...

21:39.473 --> 21:40.774
San Antonio Air Street.

21:40.794 --> 21:42.056
That's right above.

21:42.256 --> 21:42.796
In Luzon.

21:43.277 --> 21:43.978
Luzon, right.

21:44.298 --> 21:45.960
It's right above Subic Bay.

21:46.760 --> 21:52.146
Well, I went out there one morning and I haven't told this, I don't think.

21:52.786 --> 21:53.587
Go ahead.

21:53.607 --> 21:55.329
I don't even know if I've told this or not.

21:55.349 --> 21:57.691
Well, there's a bunch of guys under the plane.

21:58.452 --> 21:59.774
They sent me out for guard duty.

22:00.594 --> 22:02.316
That's why we had to do guard duty on the plane.

22:02.436 --> 22:06.420
So I had my .45 and went out there to get in the plane, listen to the radio and whatever.

22:06.861 --> 22:09.143
All these guys, troops were under the plane, about 10 of them.

22:09.663 --> 22:10.765
I said, you going to fly out tomorrow?

22:10.785 --> 22:12.167
He said, no, we're here to guard your plane.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.450
I said, well, all right.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.092
Well, they had hand grenades, rifles.

22:16.913 --> 22:21.360
So I pulled the stair down and I got up there and I said, y'all want some hot cocoa or hot coffee?

22:21.901 --> 22:22.622
Yes, sir.

22:23.623 --> 22:24.304
I said, all right.

22:24.324 --> 22:25.987
Now, this is illegal, what I did.

22:26.007 --> 22:27.929
This is going to be for emergencies.

22:28.911 --> 22:30.293
So I called two of them up there.

22:30.313 --> 22:30.974
I said, look at the back.

22:30.994 --> 22:32.296
There's some bee rashes back there.

22:32.316 --> 22:32.837
Bring them up here.

22:32.877 --> 22:33.297
Open them up.

22:33.317 --> 22:37.083
We're going to have bacon, beans, biscuits, chocolate bars.

22:38.405 --> 22:38.725
Man.

22:39.194 --> 22:42.039
I started up my little kitchen there and I fed all these guys.

22:42.119 --> 22:48.870
And then I got, just as soon as we got through eating, I said, y'all want to hear, they had their earphones all the way down and bucket seats.

22:48.890 --> 22:50.432
Y'all want to hear Tokyo Rose?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.294
Yeah.

22:51.314 --> 22:52.095
So I'd get them.

22:52.516 --> 22:54.018
What about Hawaii?

22:54.038 --> 22:54.719
You want Hawaii?

22:54.799 --> 22:56.202
Yeah, I can get everybody.

22:56.883 --> 22:57.664
What about Frisco?

22:57.904 --> 23:00.629
Yeah, let's have Frisco and get the latest news.

23:00.649 --> 23:00.989
Go ahead.

23:01.190 --> 23:02.131
Yeah.

23:02.432 --> 23:03.193
Why don't I take a,

23:03.460 --> 23:26.194
look here when we get this oh what is this that we're looking at we can sort of go out on it a little bit maybe what is this that we're looking at right there there we go what is that what is that they uh we did that's propaganda we dropped b-29s dropped those in japan that's propaganda they showed all these out if you can see all the islands oh it's sideways it's a it's a clock sideways clock so you can see it all there you go well

23:26.174 --> 23:50.781
that with a big hand it's on uh okinawa right and it shows it's going to japan and they're next all these other islands we knocked out we captured and this is propaganda that y'all would drop from your airplane no we didn't know b-29s b-29s would yeah just to tell them you're next give up you're next you're next is that right is that right uh i want to uh

23:51.267 --> 23:55.733
This is something that hangs on your back porch or near your back porch, and you're very proud of it.

23:56.154 --> 24:01.542
This is your shadow box that has your medals in it.

24:01.602 --> 24:05.988
If we can get a good shot at it, talk a little bit about what we're gonna be looking at here.

24:06.409 --> 24:13.159
First off, here's a picture of the young Sergeant Al Hanson, and describe some of those medals for us.

24:13.179 --> 24:18.827
Well, I have four battle stars there, and I'm not really proud of it, because these other guys,

24:19.972 --> 24:24.717
The Marines, Army landed those places.

24:24.737 --> 24:25.338
They did the work.

24:26.659 --> 24:26.760
Yeah.

24:26.780 --> 24:30.223
They got Battlestar, they got the Purple Heart, a lot of them got the White Cross.

24:30.604 --> 24:31.945
Right, right.

24:31.965 --> 24:36.791
I don't think I was entitled to them, but we just fly in and fly out.

24:36.871 --> 24:39.714
Sometimes we had to spend the night because the storm was something.

24:40.655 --> 24:43.138
But, you know, I didn't shoot it.

24:43.198 --> 24:47.903
I'm sure we were shot at, but apparently they didn't shoot at us because they disclosed their

24:48.389 --> 24:53.334
location than a P-47 would blast them with napalm.

24:53.354 --> 24:54.695
Yeah, they wouldn't have shoot at us.

24:54.715 --> 24:56.037
But you put yourself in harm's way.

24:56.898 --> 25:06.347
And you were always in danger, I guess, of losing your life, like one of the nearly 500,000 that lost their life in World War II.

25:06.747 --> 25:08.209
And you were decorated for that.

25:08.229 --> 25:10.912
And I think that that's well deserved.

25:10.932 --> 25:13.775
But you think other people deserve it more.

25:13.795 --> 25:14.435
Yeah, I do there.

25:14.816 --> 25:17.198
And what's funny, with Flanagan,

25:17.853 --> 25:20.717
Nadzab to Hollandia.

25:21.318 --> 25:22.781
You pronounced it wrong the other night.

25:22.841 --> 25:23.241
Okay.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.385
And that's where Bacatha was.

25:25.966 --> 25:27.708
But we had to fly over the Stanley Mountains.

25:28.269 --> 25:36.101
And they told us, I said, look, if you crash, these people there, these ladies there have never seen people like us.

25:36.121 --> 25:37.103
There's headhunters there.

25:37.884 --> 25:42.291
Just head for the coast and a submarine will pick you up.

25:42.777 --> 25:46.681
Now, wasn't that crazy?

25:46.701 --> 25:46.981
Indeed.

25:47.301 --> 25:55.008
You were a former commander of the American Legion in Hearn and a former commander of the VFW right here in Bryan.

25:55.028 --> 26:00.853
I know that's something you're proud of and your continued involvement with the VFW here.

26:00.873 --> 26:01.114
Thank you.

26:01.134 --> 26:02.275
It's a great organization, isn't it?

26:02.535 --> 26:02.895
Great.

26:04.517 --> 26:06.679
Tell you what else a great organization is your back porch.

26:07.619 --> 26:08.620
Doesn't that mean a lot to you?

26:08.640 --> 26:12.784
I mean, every morning, you and your friends, World War II buddies, you get together.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.273
And you just talk.

26:14.494 --> 26:15.876
How did that develop?

26:16.397 --> 26:21.224
Well, it's mostly about the war, about the VFW, girls.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.649
Things that we can't talk about, but things that we can, right?

26:24.669 --> 26:27.233
If I got time to add this real quick.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.638
We were flying from Okinawa.

26:30.658 --> 26:33.963
Let's see where we were flying from.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.186
No, we were flying from the Philippines to Okinawa.

26:37.569 --> 26:39.632
And to get off track.

26:39.652 --> 26:39.852
Yeah.

26:40.388 --> 26:42.491
We had to go in on a certain frequency.

26:42.952 --> 26:48.360
To go to that frequency, they had a submarine out there under the water with an antenna on it.

26:48.380 --> 26:49.241
We'd fly out of that.

26:49.721 --> 26:50.623
The pilot did all that.

26:50.643 --> 26:51.784
I had nothing to do with that.

26:51.804 --> 26:54.308
The pilot would fly to that signal and, boy, we'd look for that.

26:54.328 --> 26:57.353
Because you knew when you was right over because that needle would turn like that.

26:57.753 --> 27:00.277
We'd look around and there'd be a submarine out there.

27:00.597 --> 27:01.318
Oh, my goodness.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.921
Al, we're out of time.

27:02.981 --> 27:06.025
It goes very quickly, but what a pleasure it has having my good friend.

27:06.005 --> 27:06.946
on the show.

27:06.966 --> 27:07.607
Thank you, Al.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.508
I talk too much.

27:08.528 --> 27:08.988
No, you don't.

27:09.028 --> 27:09.869
You talk just right.

27:10.510 --> 27:13.353
So now you've met one of my favorite veterans, Uncle Al Hanson.

27:13.413 --> 27:18.359
I wish you could all gather some time on his back porch to hear the stories of the greatest generation.

27:18.659 --> 27:20.722
But there's just not enough room.

27:20.742 --> 27:21.923
I'll just keep bringing them here.

27:22.003 --> 27:25.667
We salute Sergeant Al Tex Hanson and all veterans for their service.

27:26.128 --> 27:29.191
And thanks to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:29.211 --> 27:31.514
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:31.574 --> 27:32.535
I'm Tom Turbiville.
