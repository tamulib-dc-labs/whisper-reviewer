00:00.031 --> 00:19.395
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:19.675 --> 00:20.657
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:21.418 --> 00:24.742
David West of Navasota is a proud Navy SEAL.

00:24.762 --> 00:29.768
He served in Vietnam from February of 1969 until April of 1973.

00:30.052 --> 00:35.202
He was seriously wounded to November 1971, received the Purple Heart.

00:35.222 --> 00:38.628
For earlier acts of bravery under fire, he received the Bronze Star.

00:39.290 --> 00:47.185
But well before Vietnam and before he became a SEAL, his assignment was two years aboard the USS Barcelona chasing hurricanes.

00:47.546 --> 00:50.912
And he says that was about as dangerous a duty as chasing Viet Cong.

00:51.432 --> 00:55.862
David West's story of service and his own personal challenges along the way.

00:55.882 --> 00:59.110
And the battle that he fights today are all inspiring.

00:59.130 --> 01:03.340
And we thank Navy SEAL David West for his service and being our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:03.420 --> 01:07.770
David, it's an honor to know you and it's an honor to have you on Veterans of the Valley.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.192
Born in Wichita, Kansas.

01:09.212 --> 01:10.694
You moved to Happy, Texas.

01:11.275 --> 01:13.979
Don't remember a whole lot about Happy, and you haven't been there much since.

01:14.040 --> 01:20.610
But you actually, your dad was transferred to Ohio, and I guess that's really where you think, where you regard yourself as growing up, right?

01:20.630 --> 01:20.790
Yes.

01:21.371 --> 01:22.673
In Ohio.

01:22.693 --> 01:25.537
Let's talk about what we referred to before you ever became a SEAL.

01:25.577 --> 01:28.441
You were aboard the USS Barcelona, and you were a hurricane chaser.

01:29.062 --> 01:30.304
And that was pretty interesting duty.

01:30.344 --> 01:31.085
Talk about that.

01:31.466 --> 01:36.053
Very interesting and very dangerous.

01:37.265 --> 01:46.538
While I was aboard the Barcelona, we chased three different hurricanes and they were all about the same depending on the wind velocity.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.423
The second hurricane was the worst.

01:50.744 --> 01:59.397
Those ships which were experimental were designed to take 72 degree rolls before they would flip over.

02:00.459 --> 02:03.863
And we were doing the 64 to 69 degree rolls.

02:03.883 --> 02:05.366
You were getting way too close to 72.

02:05.406 --> 02:06.327
Very close.

02:06.728 --> 02:09.070
Too close for comfort.

02:09.471 --> 02:10.432
Indeed.

02:10.452 --> 02:18.039
So it was pretty hectic going into the eye, but then describe once you got into the eye of the hurricane.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.183
Well, once we got into the eye, it was a completely different world in there.

02:22.924 --> 02:27.648
That water was just smooth as glass.

02:28.929 --> 02:32.813
And there were water fountains and rainbows and birds flying around.

02:33.674 --> 02:35.976
It was really something I'll never forget.

02:36.850 --> 02:37.631
There was no wind.

02:38.372 --> 02:41.776
Like you said, birds, it was beautiful.

02:42.817 --> 02:43.899
But then you had to go back out.

02:43.939 --> 02:46.221
You never got seasick though, right?

02:46.241 --> 02:47.623
No, never did get seasick.

02:48.004 --> 02:48.284
Yeah.

02:49.425 --> 02:50.967
Everybody around me did, but I didn't.

02:51.888 --> 02:54.872
One time you talked about it being kind of a hairy experience.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.675
You had to jump out of your bunk and you jumped into about a foot of water.

02:57.996 --> 03:00.479
Yes, sir.

03:00.499 --> 03:01.440
We had...

03:03.293 --> 03:06.918
We'd been up for, oh, golly, about 15, 16 hours straight.

03:08.260 --> 03:13.528
And we took turns going to bed.

03:14.729 --> 03:15.170
Excuse me.

03:17.153 --> 03:22.440
And we crawled in our bunks, which were in tiers.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.682
And I was in the middle tier.

03:23.702 --> 03:26.546
We had to strap ourselves in to keep from getting thrown out.

03:28.148 --> 03:30.752
And when it was my time to

03:31.087 --> 03:38.134
wake up, I jumped out of my bunk and landed in about 12 inches of water.

03:38.514 --> 03:38.735
Right.

03:39.796 --> 03:46.482
Which made me wonder, are we underwater or what?

03:46.783 --> 03:51.667
Two years on the bass alone and then you went into training in UDT's underwater demolition team.

03:52.668 --> 03:56.352
That didn't last long, but talk about that duty and what that was about.

03:56.990 --> 04:13.367
Well, basically we went through their training, which was mostly in the water, and training on different types of demolition and explosives.

04:14.809 --> 04:23.318
And we practiced a lot running up onto the beaches and planting explosives.

04:25.694 --> 04:31.060
It was something that I was about halfway interested in.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.985
I wasn't totally or completely happy with it.

04:37.167 --> 04:41.893
And I did that from 1958 till 62.

04:41.933 --> 04:53.806
62 is when President Kennedy formed the Naval Special Forces, which we know as the Navy SEALs.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.448
Why did you want to join the Navy SEALs?

04:56.103 --> 04:58.146
I was just looking for adventure.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.027
Yes, sir.

05:00.048 --> 05:02.251
And I also wanted to see how far I could go.

05:03.472 --> 05:08.679
The Navy SEAL training is very, very hard.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.123
Hell Week started it off.

05:12.163 --> 05:16.589
You said it started at midnight on a Sunday and it ended on midnight on the next Sunday.

05:16.609 --> 05:17.610
That was called Hell Week.

05:17.810 --> 05:18.031
Yes.

05:18.051 --> 05:18.671
Talk about that.

05:19.512 --> 05:25.620
Well, during that week, if you got two to three hours of sleep, you were lucky.

05:26.748 --> 05:32.638
They pushed you to your extreme limits.

05:32.658 --> 05:37.367
Everything they did was, I mean, they forced you to do things.

05:39.410 --> 05:48.146
Like we had to swim in a mud bath, which was very difficult, because we had to do it on our backs.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.692
And from point A to point B,

05:53.275 --> 06:12.455
We'd have to run up and down the beach carrying those rafts, those heavy rafts, and just things that a large percentage of us just couldn't do it.

06:12.595 --> 06:13.516
They couldn't make it through.

06:13.836 --> 06:19.502
As a matter of fact, you said the original number was cut down quite a bit by the time the training was over.

06:19.567 --> 06:20.468
Yes, sir.

06:20.488 --> 06:23.951
My class started out with 33 men and ended up with 11.

06:23.971 --> 06:28.436
I think you said the next class was the retention rate was even worse.

06:29.056 --> 06:33.240
Started out at 100 men and 21 made it through.

06:34.542 --> 06:35.042
But you did.

06:35.703 --> 06:36.063
Yes, sir.

06:36.283 --> 06:37.485
But don't ask me how.

06:38.826 --> 06:42.810
And you admit that there were four or five times that you wanted to quit.

06:42.830 --> 06:49.236
And you talked about the method that they were told if they did want to quit, what they were to do.

06:49.874 --> 06:52.800
All we had to do was take our hat off and lay it between our feet.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.784
No questions asked.

06:55.446 --> 06:58.152
And you were sent right back to the unit you came from.

06:59.735 --> 07:03.563
Now, I'm not sure just when they started that,

07:04.117 --> 07:09.743
you got a little podium with a bell on it and you go up and ring the bell and it means the same thing.

07:09.783 --> 07:11.785
It means the same thing.

07:11.805 --> 07:11.905
Yeah.

07:11.925 --> 07:12.025
Yeah.

07:12.046 --> 07:13.827
This is what I was cut out for.

07:13.847 --> 07:17.051
Didn't sign up for this, but you stayed and you became a Navy seal.

07:17.111 --> 07:21.616
Now the training continued for about six months after what was considered hell week.

07:21.636 --> 07:26.701
But during that time, the Cuban Missile Crisis broke out and your duty somewhat changed.

07:26.721 --> 07:30.225
Talk about your duty around Guantanamo Bay.

07:30.492 --> 07:34.376
and what your duty was there as far as sort of a security?

07:34.396 --> 07:47.210
Well, when the Cuban crisis originally broke out, they were concerned about the missiles coming from Russia to Cuba.

07:49.452 --> 07:57.821
And they had ships out there stopping the Russian freighters and boarding them and checking out their cargo.

07:57.841 --> 07:58.862
In the meantime,

07:59.973 --> 08:13.245
they evacuated the Americans from Guantanamo Bay, the military families and the civilian workers, and we were sent down there to cover the evacuation.

08:13.265 --> 08:27.178
In swift boats and river patrol boats, we paroled the coastline, and the Cubans

08:28.323 --> 08:35.553
sent out gunboats, those small gunboats, and we'd chase them back to Savannah Harbor.

08:36.434 --> 08:37.675
That was kind of fun, wasn't it?

08:37.695 --> 08:38.216
Oh, yeah.

08:38.617 --> 08:41.741
We had a lot of fun doing that.

08:41.761 --> 08:44.585
But no shots were fired or anything.

08:47.989 --> 08:50.753
They knew what they were doing, and they knew you were chasing them.

08:50.773 --> 08:50.953
Oh, yeah.

08:50.973 --> 08:55.519
So there weren't any secrets here, and they went back to where you wanted them to be.

08:55.819 --> 08:56.220
Yes, sir.

08:57.601 --> 08:59.743
No harm done, no shots were fired.

09:00.404 --> 09:03.868
All of these movements, you told me, these were highly classified.

09:03.928 --> 09:05.450
You couldn't tell anyone.

09:05.470 --> 09:10.956
As a matter of fact, your wife at the time didn't even know where you were or what you were doing, right?

09:10.976 --> 09:11.236
Yeah.

09:11.356 --> 09:12.718
No, we couldn't.

09:13.178 --> 09:20.026
It was completely top secret, our movements, our actions, and so on.

09:20.046 --> 09:20.627
Right.

09:20.647 --> 09:24.411
We couldn't talk about it to anybody except ourselves.

09:24.691 --> 09:27.034
Right, right, right.

09:27.622 --> 09:36.312
Vietnam, as you rightly told me, actually, the issue of Vietnam had started really as far back as 1958 as a police action.

09:36.332 --> 09:40.416
But it was starting to become known as what we knew as the Vietnam War.

09:40.496 --> 09:47.244
But before you trained for Vietnam, you were on Malta working with the British Navy briefly.

09:47.304 --> 09:48.245
Talk about that duty.

09:48.745 --> 09:55.773
Well, we were sent to Malta to work with a British Special Forces unit.

09:55.793 --> 09:57.595
And I wasn't there very long.

09:58.587 --> 10:07.045
I got word that my father was critically ill, and they sent me back to the States.

10:08.577 --> 10:10.239
The trip back was something else.

10:11.401 --> 10:22.875
They took me on a helicopter out to sea to a ship and dropped me off on the ship by a high line, which was scary.

10:24.678 --> 10:35.732
And then I was transferred to an aircraft carrier and put on a plane that they flew me to Norfolk, Virginia,

10:37.147 --> 10:50.162
I had connections to fly to Ohio where my family lived, but I found out that he was in Rochester, New York on a business trip.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.183
When he became ill.

10:51.203 --> 10:52.985
When he became ill.

10:53.005 --> 10:57.850
And I couldn't get a flight out to New York until the next day.

10:57.871 --> 11:01.855
And when the plane landed, my brother and my sister met me at the airfield.

11:02.830 --> 11:06.494
Told me that my father had passed away about two hours before I got there.

11:08.135 --> 11:13.861
And the Red Cross failed to let me know where my father was at.

11:14.582 --> 11:16.224
That's very unfortunate, obviously.

11:16.244 --> 11:18.586
Something that stays with you, obviously.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.110
Sent to Vietnam in country, February of 1969.

11:22.770 --> 11:23.771
Landed in Saigon.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.134
And what did they tell you when you landed?

11:26.154 --> 11:31.779
You were in some ways a popular organization, the Navy SEALs, in kind of the bad sort of way.

11:31.819 --> 11:32.500
Talk about that.

11:32.935 --> 11:37.260
Well, when we got there, we stepped off the plane.

11:37.280 --> 11:53.760
We were met by a marine gunny sergeant who held us up and said, once your feet hit the ground in Saigon, you automatically have a $1,500 bounty on your head.

11:53.780 --> 11:57.864
The Viet Cong are the ones that put the bounty on our head.

11:58.305 --> 12:00.968
They were deathly afraid of us.

12:02.416 --> 12:07.122
And if they could get one of us, they'd get that money.

12:10.367 --> 12:17.557
But you were a highly, I keep using the word respected as in, like you said, they were afraid of you.

12:17.617 --> 12:18.678
They called you green faces.

12:18.698 --> 12:20.341
They called you ghosts who walk at night.

12:22.203 --> 12:32.237
There were times you've described to me that there were times that you could sort of be in an ambush of a Viet Cong platoon or squad.

12:33.095 --> 12:36.020
And you wouldn't have to fire a shot or very few shots that they'd run away.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.204
They were that frightened of the Navy SEALs.

12:38.224 --> 12:38.765
Yes, sir.

12:38.785 --> 12:49.183
The reason for that is we had our faces painted with all the green and the black, and we kind of blended in with the jungle.

12:49.584 --> 12:49.804
Right.

12:50.712 --> 12:59.163
And when we'd spot the patrol, the enemy patrol, we'd just drop down to the ground just on our haunches.

12:59.183 --> 13:08.274
And we'd wait until they get all about from here to halfway across the room there.

13:09.276 --> 13:14.082
And we'd stand up very slowly and open our eyes.

13:14.582 --> 13:16.585
And that's all they could see is our eyes.

13:17.054 --> 13:20.140
and it scared them so bad they dropped their weapons and ran.

13:20.661 --> 13:22.965
That scares me, you describing it, as a matter of fact.

13:24.187 --> 13:27.393
Sent to the Mekong Delta at Kamau Bay, is that right?

13:27.554 --> 13:28.014
Kamau Bay.

13:28.034 --> 13:29.317
Kamau Bay.

13:29.337 --> 13:35.588
And you were sent on a patrol based on information that was given to you by the CIA, but it turned out that that information was not timely.

13:36.009 --> 13:36.430
No, sir.

13:36.933 --> 13:43.164
The information we got from CIA was anywhere from two weeks to two months old.

13:43.845 --> 13:54.243
And we'd go out on patrol and subject ourselves to running into enemy patrols for nothing.

13:55.685 --> 14:02.417
So our commanding officer said, to heck with the CIA, we'll operate on our own info.

14:02.397 --> 14:04.479
He didn't say to heck with the CIA.

14:07.463 --> 14:14.631
So you did that, and you were sent to Cam Ranh Bay to assist training South Vietnamese Navy SEALs.

14:16.473 --> 14:17.113
Talk about that.

14:17.974 --> 14:22.259
These South Vietnamese, these were pretty brave soldiers.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.482
Some of them were.

14:26.003 --> 14:31.189
The ones that were the Navy SEALs were...

14:33.025 --> 14:34.927
very devout in their beliefs.

14:36.849 --> 14:40.834
Matter of fact, they used to have tattoos on their chest.

14:41.935 --> 14:46.460
Said shot Kong, which means kill Kong.

14:46.480 --> 15:00.195
And we worked with them and trained them in certain phases and mostly in weapons and so on.

15:02.277 --> 15:02.998
And

15:05.577 --> 15:14.588
While I was there, the South Vietnamese Navy lieutenant said he wanted to play a joke on the Viet Cong.

15:16.010 --> 15:23.859
So he picked five of us to go with him to a village called Su Chin, which means number nine.

15:25.841 --> 15:31.328
And it was a Viet Cong rest and recreation village.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.492
And we walked in there.

15:34.512 --> 15:35.533
We were fully armed.

15:36.053 --> 15:38.716
And we walked in there and we went to this bar.

15:40.357 --> 15:49.127
And there were about five males there and a few females.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.329
When we walked in, they all left.

15:52.971 --> 15:56.194
So we went to another bar and walked in.

15:56.274 --> 15:58.336
There was about seven or eight of them, I guess.

15:59.037 --> 16:00.238
I can't remember now.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.625
They all left.

16:03.645 --> 16:09.037
And when we went back to base camp, the Vietnamese lieutenant thought that was very funny.

16:10.420 --> 16:10.961
We didn't.

16:12.284 --> 16:12.886
I can imagine.

16:13.727 --> 16:16.053
And we got chewed out by our CEO.

16:17.897 --> 16:20.843
And the lieutenant got chewed out for it also.

16:21.295 --> 16:23.178
I've got a few pictures here.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.942
I think three pictures here I just want to show right now.

16:25.962 --> 16:28.165
First one is a very young David West.

16:28.866 --> 16:29.847
You say you're about 17 there.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.748
Yes, sir.

16:30.768 --> 16:32.731
You look about 17 years old there.

16:36.076 --> 16:38.179
Next photograph, move forward.

16:38.239 --> 16:38.820
Describe this.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.103
You're on the far left in this photograph.

16:41.123 --> 16:41.404
Yes, sir.

16:41.424 --> 16:43.987
This is a photograph from a book that you own called Seals at War.

16:44.929 --> 16:46.611
Talk about what we're seeing there.

16:47.097 --> 16:58.911
We were getting ready to go out on a patrol on a raft into the canal and we're gonna cross the canal and go on into the jungle looking for a downed pilot.

17:00.533 --> 17:16.632
And we, in this picture, we were preparing ourselves by locking and loading, as the paraphrase goes, getting our weapons ready and our equipment.

17:18.282 --> 17:21.546
And then a final picture of you, where was this one taken?

17:21.566 --> 17:28.816
That was taken at the Kamao Bay at our home base.

17:28.836 --> 17:29.718
I wouldn't mess with that guy.

17:31.700 --> 17:36.747
Your duty, your unit's duty was mainly looking for downed pilots.

17:37.008 --> 17:37.208
Yes.

17:37.588 --> 17:39.811
That was what your aim was.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.916
Downed pilots and so-called POW camps.

17:43.056 --> 17:43.276
Right.

17:43.637 --> 17:46.821
You found one POW camp, but they were South Vietnamese.

17:47.172 --> 17:50.096
prisoners, found no Americans there.

17:50.116 --> 17:51.197
No Americans there.

17:51.217 --> 17:51.478
Indeed.

17:52.800 --> 18:00.490
Talk about the action that resulted in your being awarded the Bronze Star.

18:00.790 --> 18:13.287
It involved a encountering a Viet Cong patrol, a point man named Daryl Moon, and the motto of no one left behind.

18:13.948 --> 18:15.390
Given all that, talk about the

18:15.893 --> 18:16.594
What happened?

18:16.614 --> 18:23.823
Well, that motto was from the beginning of our training, that nobody gets left behind.

18:23.963 --> 18:25.745
Yes, sir.

18:25.765 --> 18:38.941
And on this particular patrol, there were seven of us, and we got ambushed by about 20 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers.

18:41.284 --> 18:43.707
And Darrell was our point man,

18:45.458 --> 18:51.224
and they shot him, but he took three of them out before he died.

18:53.546 --> 19:07.140
And we were able to get Darrell, and we were heading back to the canal, and there was a river patrol boat there waiting on us.

19:09.122 --> 19:15.128
And while the other guys were, we had to wade from the bank out to the boat,

19:16.694 --> 19:28.872
And while they were putting Darrell aboard the boat, I stayed by the bank and laid down a covering fire until they got him aboard where we could leave.

19:30.234 --> 19:35.261
And somebody wrote it up and I got the brown star for that.

19:36.623 --> 19:38.946
Well deserved, no doubt.

19:39.707 --> 19:44.254
2 November 1971,

19:44.943 --> 19:47.487
You earned a Purple Heart.

19:47.648 --> 19:48.229
Talk about that.

19:49.391 --> 20:07.322
Well, we were on another patrol and we got ambushed and I was hit in the stomach with an AK-47 and it felt like somebody hit me in the stomach with a very hard baseball bat.

20:08.399 --> 20:14.849
And I was still walking around, and they tackled me to get me down so I wouldn't get hit again.

20:16.872 --> 20:29.752
And they called in the SEAL helicopters, the Wolverine, and the medevac chopper landed and picked me up and took me to Saigon.

20:29.832 --> 20:36.162
Well, they took me to a MASH unit first, and then from the MASH unit and went to the hospital in Saigon.

20:36.445 --> 20:38.188
and I spent about 30 days there.

20:39.790 --> 20:45.678
Then they transferred me to the hospital in Tokyo, Japan, and I spent about 30 days there.

20:45.698 --> 20:52.929
Then they sent me home for a 30-day recuperation leave, and I didn't have to go back to Vietnam.

20:54.531 --> 21:03.244
But when I got home, I learned about my wife's boyfriend, and I only spent nine days at home and went back to be with my buddies.

21:04.325 --> 21:05.307
For good reason.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.368
They said,

21:08.187 --> 21:10.731
I'm going to let you go ahead and continue that story.

21:10.751 --> 21:13.655
We're going to fast forward a little bit, then we'll come back.

21:13.715 --> 21:15.217
But it's a story you don't mind telling.

21:15.597 --> 21:19.002
First off, let's say that you've been married to Cecilia for 25 years.

21:19.503 --> 21:29.857
You and Cecilia have a daughter who was 11 years old when you entered the scene, and she has given you two grandchildren who live close by at Cyprus, and you get to see a lot.

21:30.017 --> 21:34.984
So life for you and Cecilia has been a wonderful marriage.

21:35.225 --> 21:35.865
Yes, it has.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.047
I know.

21:37.567 --> 21:44.256
The first marriage, you just said you found out about the wife's boyfriend, and then later when you went home again, you surprised them.

21:44.276 --> 21:44.977
Tell them that story.

21:47.641 --> 22:02.381
Well, when we were pulled out of Vietnam in April of 73, we came back to the States to Treasure Island in San Francisco.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.168
And from there, we were transferred, most of them,

22:07.537 --> 22:12.164
most of our guys were transferred back to Coronado to the seal camp.

22:13.667 --> 22:19.335
They messed my orders up and sent me to Boston, Massachusetts as tug master.

22:21.499 --> 22:23.422
And I didn't tell anybody I was coming.

22:23.462 --> 22:27.969
My wife and my kids were in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

22:30.433 --> 22:35.080
And I got home, I walked in the house,

22:36.443 --> 22:48.218
and I walked back to the kitchen, and my wife was sitting there, her younger brother was sitting there, and her boyfriend was sitting there wearing my clothes.

22:48.238 --> 22:52.163
And I call it a stupid move.

22:52.223 --> 23:06.180
He stood up and extended his hand to shake hands with me and introduce himself, and I just grabbed his hand and grabbed a handful of hair, jerked him across the table, and commenced beating him

23:06.802 --> 23:08.365
all the way out the front door.

23:09.527 --> 23:10.989
And the neighbors called the police.

23:11.770 --> 23:15.297
He went to the hospital, and I went to jail.

23:15.317 --> 23:18.662
So I spent my first night home in jail.

23:18.682 --> 23:26.415
And I went before the judge at 9 o'clock the next morning, and he was very pro-military, and he asked me what happened, and I told him.

23:27.357 --> 23:29.080
And he smiled and says, get out of here.

23:32.063 --> 23:35.446
In the four years I've been doing this show, that might be one of my favorite stories.

23:38.189 --> 23:43.373
I've got to tell you now, especially since things have turned out so well with you and Cecilia.

23:43.774 --> 23:52.141
And you have four children by your first wife, and they live a long way away, and you haven't seen them in a long time, but you do keep in contact with some of them.

23:52.161 --> 23:52.361
Yes, I do.

23:52.381 --> 23:53.162
And that's a good thing.

23:53.663 --> 24:00.008
You couldn't continue as a SEAL because of your wounds, transferred, like you said, to the Boston Shipyard as a tugboat, as a tugmaster.

24:01.510 --> 24:01.750
We're...

24:02.033 --> 24:04.096
running short on time and I want to get to other things.

24:04.116 --> 24:10.386
You were transferred to Pearl Harbor and later became Chief of Security of Marine Navy Hospital there.

24:10.407 --> 24:10.507
Yes.

24:10.567 --> 24:11.929
Talk about that duty.

24:11.949 --> 24:13.552
Well, that was very interesting.

24:14.794 --> 24:20.944
They didn't have what they call Mastered Arms that was a regular Mastered Arms.

24:21.324 --> 24:24.970
As a matter of fact, it was a first-class petty officer

24:25.422 --> 24:25.903
WAVE.

24:27.565 --> 24:32.731
And no records, and what little records they had was all messed up.

24:34.353 --> 24:54.096
And when I was assigned there as Chief of Security, I had to go in that office and straighten everything out, get all the paperwork laid out, all the forms laid out, and train my crew

24:55.645 --> 25:01.135
And it was an interesting job.

25:02.497 --> 25:10.431
We had, matter of fact, the only person I had to answer to was the admiral of the hospital.

25:11.137 --> 25:22.011
And some of these officers that would come in there, I mean, I was just, you know, senior chief petty officer, but some of these officers that would come in there, they'd start giving me orders.

25:22.031 --> 25:22.352
Yes, sir.

25:23.393 --> 25:26.738
And I would tell them, well, I'll have to check with the admiral on it.

25:27.238 --> 25:28.420
They didn't like that.

25:31.144 --> 25:33.447
But I had a lot of fun there.

25:34.268 --> 25:38.794
You retired in June of 1979, retired from the Navy at that time.

25:39.495 --> 25:40.536
You came back to Amarillo.

25:40.837 --> 25:41.338
Yes, sir.

25:41.358 --> 25:43.440
Amarillo Police Department you worked for.

25:43.460 --> 25:44.741
That's where you met Cecilia.

25:44.761 --> 25:44.962
Yes.

25:45.022 --> 25:46.884
Was when you were in Amarillo.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.786
Became a private investigator.

25:48.806 --> 25:53.251
Came down to Navasota to work for the Texas Department of Corrections.

25:53.271 --> 25:53.711
Is that right?

25:53.731 --> 25:54.432
Yes, sir.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.875
And retired there in 2000.

25:57.435 --> 26:01.220
And most recently, your work has been with the Grimes County and the Brazos County Sheriff's Office.

26:01.300 --> 26:01.600
Yes, sir.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.722
I know that's been an interesting duty.

26:04.123 --> 26:06.085
I want to finish up.

26:06.503 --> 26:09.387
You had to retire from that and completely retire.

26:09.527 --> 26:12.311
In June of 2008, you were diagnosed with lung cancer.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.153
Yes.

26:13.173 --> 26:19.943
And that went into remission, but now they say that it's come back and you're under treatment right now.

26:20.163 --> 26:26.853
Talk about that battle that you're fighting and your look at that and how it's going.

26:26.873 --> 26:30.638
Well, they found the lung cancer in the lymph nodes

26:30.989 --> 26:34.955
outside the lung, but they classified as lung cancer.

26:36.317 --> 26:43.368
And they started me on chemotherapy and radiation, which lasted about seven weeks.

26:43.388 --> 26:48.676
I'd go for chemotherapy once a week, radiation five days a week.

26:50.859 --> 26:59.072
And after I got off of that, they did a CAT scan, came back and says, hey, we can't find it.

27:01.060 --> 27:08.750
And it was in remission and that made me feel a lot better.

27:08.770 --> 27:12.815
Then a year later, they did another CAT scan and they said it's back.

27:14.236 --> 27:16.659
And it had gone down into my adrenal area.

27:18.802 --> 27:26.271
And so they put me on chemotherapy again, which is stronger than the other, only once every three weeks.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.797
And that just drove me down completely.

27:31.064 --> 27:33.506
It made me so weak that I couldn't do anything.

27:33.627 --> 27:34.868
Yes, sir.

27:34.888 --> 27:37.630
And I told my chemo doctor no more.

27:38.531 --> 27:42.115
And now you're on pills and that's working better for you.

27:42.135 --> 27:43.356
Yes, sir.

27:43.376 --> 27:46.619
We're out of time, David, and wish you the very best.

27:46.739 --> 27:48.121
And thank you very much for your service.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.162
Thank you, sir.

27:49.202 --> 27:51.023
You have no idea the honor it is to know you.

27:51.424 --> 27:51.804
Thank you.

27:51.944 --> 27:53.025
Thank you for your service.

27:54.046 --> 27:59.772
This is one of those stories of courage and bravery that fills chapter after chapter of the history of the Vietnam War.

28:00.190 --> 28:03.440
David West is now in a retirement he well deserves.

28:03.460 --> 28:08.155
We wish him and Cecilia and their family the very best, and we salute him for his service.

28:08.837 --> 28:09.821
I'm Tom Turbiville.

28:09.841 --> 28:12.208
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
