00:05.482 --> 00:29.055
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.477
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:30.963 --> 00:33.226
It's my pleasure to introduce you to Bill Hamilton.

00:33.346 --> 00:38.052
There is a good chance that a lot of you already know this outgoing gentleman of the Brazos Valley.

00:38.573 --> 00:48.186
Bill is a veteran, did not serve in any overseas combat, but the battles he's fought since January of 1981, well, that is one that he wins every day.

00:48.666 --> 00:53.112
He's a volunteer, a proud member, and assistant chaplain of Disabled Americans Veterans.

00:53.753 --> 00:59.721
He sings and writes poems, and you'll soon understand how he turned a personal nightmare into hope and faith.

01:00.123 --> 01:03.910
It's my pleasure to welcome Sergeant Bill Hamilton to Veterans of the Valley.

01:04.571 --> 01:07.236
Bill, it is indeed a pleasure to have you here.

01:08.018 --> 01:09.600
Thank you for your service, sir.

01:10.382 --> 01:12.967
Let's start off with what we alluded to right there.

01:12.987 --> 01:17.475
It was, I think we determined 1981, January of 1981, it was Super Bowl Sunday.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.998
You were 33 years old.

01:19.018 --> 01:20.561
Talk about what happened to you that day.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.987
I was sitting home with the family watching the Super Bowl.

01:24.524 --> 01:35.295
a regular Sunday afternoon, I started having a bad headache and all of a sudden I went into a grandma seizure and fell on the floor.

01:36.656 --> 01:50.110
The next thing I knew it was two months later after brain surgery and the doctor was telling me I had just come out of a two month coma after they found out that I had contracted a viral encephalitis.

01:50.427 --> 01:57.555
And they had to do emergency brain surgery on me to remove my right temporal brain lobe.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.899
And since that time, it's just been one rehabilitation after another.

02:01.439 --> 02:04.062
I finished all the rehabilitations quite a few years ago.

02:04.783 --> 02:10.249
And I've been able to live them all in my one bedroom apartment with my little dog, Bella.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.493
And I do a lot of volunteer work, which I love dearly.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.536
Working with children and working with disabled veterans.

02:17.377 --> 02:22.483
Your life before that two months and your life after that month, those two months were over.

02:22.643 --> 02:33.096
Besides the grand mal seizure that caused your seizure and caused your brain injury, there were a lot of other personal changes in your life when you came out two months later.

02:33.376 --> 02:35.699
And I know you don't mind talking about that with your family.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.283
What happened?

02:41.575 --> 02:49.904
My parents, when they came up to see me in the recovery room, I asked my mother and dad where my wife and my children were.

02:51.446 --> 02:55.630
And mother said, well, Judy's no longer here.

02:57.132 --> 03:02.338
She divorced you and married a man in the Army, and they moved to Germany with Brad and Heather.

03:02.358 --> 03:02.858
My goodness.

03:03.439 --> 03:05.001
So that was another kick.

03:06.542 --> 03:09.465
And I spent a lot of time trying to get over that, too.

03:09.906 --> 03:10.907
Yes, sir.

03:11.427 --> 03:23.026
I have since, I date now, when I'm finally a lady that's, I believe in women's liberation because they have to come by to pick me up.

03:23.066 --> 03:23.868
I can't drive.

03:24.910 --> 03:25.871
So I believe in that.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.013
You're a big believer.

03:27.093 --> 03:28.956
I'm a big believer in women's liberation.

03:29.157 --> 03:32.963
But I go out and dance at the Hall of Shame, Hall of Fame.

03:33.517 --> 03:40.025
I wanted to set the scene there to show people about what you have overcome, and we'll talk more about that later, but let's go early in your life.

03:40.045 --> 03:47.215
You grew up in Abilene, and sort of take us from there and sort of your path to the military and on up through there.

03:47.335 --> 03:48.156
All right.

03:48.176 --> 03:51.280
I graduated Abilene High School in 1966 at the age of 19.

03:51.300 --> 03:58.789
I immediately started a McMurray College, which was a Methodist-affiliated college there in Abilene.

03:58.869 --> 04:02.494
I majored in pre-med.

04:02.778 --> 04:06.884
I wanted all my life, since I was a little child, to be a doctor.

04:06.904 --> 04:13.634
I majored in pre-med and I started working at Hendrix Memorial Hospital as a respiratory therapy technician.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.819
And I fell head over heels in love with that career.

04:18.001 --> 04:26.153
And it's a good thing because my very first exam in chemistry, I made the biggest

04:26.335 --> 04:33.156
most beautiful, brilliant colored red F. And I said, well, I can't be a doctor and fail with flunk chemistry.

04:33.490 --> 04:37.497
So all my hopes and dreams were just spurred.

04:38.138 --> 04:42.145
But I was, frankly, I fell in love with respiratory therapy.

04:42.185 --> 04:43.847
At that time, it was called inhalation therapy.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.829
Yes, sir.

04:44.849 --> 04:50.999
And I started concentrating on that, and that's what I made my life, my vocation to do.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.363
You moved to Dallas, enrolled at El Centro College there.

04:53.404 --> 04:56.990
There was a two-year program there that you were able to... Registry program.

04:57.691 --> 04:58.452
While I was there,

04:58.786 --> 05:04.941
I worked at Children's Medical Center as a senior respiratory therapy, a pediatric respiratory therapist.

05:05.001 --> 05:07.286
And I was the educational director of the department.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.288
Right, right.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.875
Son was born in 1971, in January of 1971.

05:10.895 --> 05:16.187
Yeah, in Dallas, and I've always called him my little Dallas cowboy.

05:16.167 --> 05:28.469
In Dallas, your draft status changed from deferred to 1A at the time, and you made the decision at that time not to go to Vietnam, but you wanted to serve in another capacity, and that's with your medical skills, right?

05:28.810 --> 05:30.072
Talk about that.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.378
I got my 1A classification.

05:33.398 --> 05:37.385
I just about died because I didn't really want to go to Vietnam.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.968
I'm not a protester.

05:40.180 --> 05:46.930
But I had a wife and a child, and I wanted to, I felt my time would be better there with them at that particular time.

05:48.032 --> 06:01.512
So I joined the United States Air Force, and after I had gone through my physical examination, all the paperwork at the draft board, I was driving home, and I drove up into my driveway.

06:02.353 --> 06:06.019
I saw a uniformed officer knocking on my front door.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.449
I jumped out of the car and said, sir, can I help you?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.311
He said, are you Robert William Hamilton?

06:11.411 --> 06:14.274
I knew I was in trouble then, because people used to call me Bill.

06:14.554 --> 06:15.075
I said, yes, sir.

06:15.095 --> 06:16.596
He says, I have your draft notice.

06:17.156 --> 06:18.438
I said, oops.

06:18.458 --> 06:23.242
So I took that draft notice, went right back down to the draft board, walked in to Sergeant Davis.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.123
I'll never forget his name.

06:24.163 --> 06:25.824
I said, Sergeant Davis, I got my draft board.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.886
He said, we finally got you, didn't we, Hamilton?

06:27.906 --> 06:28.607
I said, you sure did.

06:28.627 --> 06:29.347
I tore it in half.

06:29.608 --> 06:31.349
He said, hey, that's 11 worth for you, fellow.

06:31.369 --> 06:31.970
He said, uh-uh.

06:32.410 --> 06:35.193
I reached in my other pocket and said, here's my induction paper.

06:35.253 --> 06:36.634
I have joined the United States Air Force.

06:36.934 --> 06:37.795
Boy, was he mad.

06:38.062 --> 06:40.685
He was mad at me doing that.

06:40.705 --> 06:42.688
But I was the property of the United States Air Force.

06:43.489 --> 06:46.332
After you're inducted, it's okay to rip up your draft notes, right?

06:46.352 --> 06:46.772
Afterwards.

06:46.793 --> 06:47.994
You were just giving him a hard time.

06:48.014 --> 06:51.358
You went to Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

06:51.378 --> 06:56.865
And not only did you serve your entire time in the military there, but you also went to school, right?

06:56.905 --> 06:58.186
At Southern Illinois University.

06:58.927 --> 07:03.933
Yeah, Scott Air Force Base at that time was the MAC headquarters, Military Airlift Command.

07:04.173 --> 07:07.157
I was assigned to the cardiopulmonary phase two

07:07.610 --> 07:11.314
technology school as an instructor in respiratory therapy in that school.

07:12.236 --> 07:16.801
And I started going to Southern Illinois University and majored in occupational education.

07:17.682 --> 07:25.592
I got my bachelor's degree, but at the same time my second child, my daughter, Heather, was born on June 23rd.

07:25.692 --> 07:27.154
I've always called her a Yankee.

07:27.814 --> 07:31.679
She's the only Hamilton that has ever been born outside of Texas.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.705
And I graduated from Southern Illinois University

07:37.377 --> 07:44.992
about a year before I got out of the service with a bachelor's degree in occupational education and a master's degree in counseling education.

07:46.255 --> 07:51.485
And after my honorable discharge, May 1st, 1971, I moved back to San Antonio.

07:52.086 --> 07:53.108
Had to do that because

07:53.493 --> 07:56.537
It took me four years to try to teach those Illinoisans how to talk Texan.

07:56.557 --> 07:57.138
I couldn't do it.

07:57.218 --> 07:58.340
So I got discouraged.

07:58.821 --> 08:00.563
I had to move back to where people talk right.

08:01.124 --> 08:01.224
Yeah.

08:01.244 --> 08:07.293
You had been to San Antonio before because after you joined the Air Force in 71, you did basic at Lackland Air Force Base, right?

08:07.313 --> 08:07.834
Yes, I did.

08:07.934 --> 08:08.234
Right.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.396
So you knew San Antonio.

08:09.817 --> 08:10.938
So it was in San Antonio.

08:10.998 --> 08:11.359
You were there.

08:11.399 --> 08:14.303
You were a buck sergeant and you moved there.

08:14.283 --> 08:18.468
And then you went into the school at St.

08:18.488 --> 08:18.848
Philip's.

08:18.868 --> 08:25.395
Sort of talking about there was a therapy school that you got a job and it was a pretty good job with a pretty good salary for a young man, right?

08:25.415 --> 08:41.573
About four or five months before I knew I was due to be discharged, I started writing colleges all over the state of Texas asking if they were interested in starting a respiratory therapy certification program, a one-year

08:41.873 --> 08:43.014
our two-year program.

08:44.696 --> 08:53.306
And about, I guess, two or three weeks before my due date for discharge came up, I got a letter back from St.

08:53.326 --> 09:09.265
Phyllis College in San Antonio, Texas, telling me that they had been looking for a person to be the chairman of a new one-year respiratory therapy certification program, starting pay at $40,000, and they were very interested in talking to me.

09:09.835 --> 09:14.120
So I took that letter down to my base commander and I said, sir, I'm gone.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.822
I am not going to reenlist.

09:15.862 --> 09:17.004
He wanted me to reenlist.

09:17.444 --> 09:19.547
Well, I said, I'm going to take my discharge.

09:19.587 --> 09:21.349
I'm going to move to San Antonio.

09:21.369 --> 09:23.411
They're going to pay me $40,000 to do that.

09:23.471 --> 09:27.857
He said, well, good luck to you, Sergeant, because we can't match that pay.

09:27.877 --> 09:29.939
You were 28 years old, $40,000.

09:30.099 --> 09:33.003
And your wife at the time also got a pretty good job too.

09:33.063 --> 09:39.150
When we got to San Antonio, my wife was a registered ultrasound technician and she got a job with a large

09:39.569 --> 09:43.313
radiology firm at another $38,000 a year.

09:44.013 --> 09:48.738
So we were both under 30 years old and making over $70,000 a year.

09:49.719 --> 09:55.324
So we bought us a great big house, too big for two people, for four of us now.

09:55.985 --> 09:57.066
My wife and my two children.

09:57.827 --> 10:05.774
A great big ski boat, fancy cars, and just start living it up, living that American dream.

10:06.695 --> 10:09.458
We went ballistic with the

10:09.674 --> 10:12.119
the money we were making.

10:12.139 --> 10:14.765
And then everything changed on that Super Bowl Sunday for you.

10:14.785 --> 10:14.885
Yeah.

10:15.566 --> 10:19.314
I was watching the Super Bowl game and I started feeling bad.

10:20.076 --> 10:22.080
I had my very first grandma seizure.

10:22.533 --> 10:27.140
I fell out on the floor, and my son was the first to see me.

10:27.601 --> 10:28.442
It scared him to death.

10:28.462 --> 10:32.949
He went and called his mother, and she came in, and she sent Brad next door to get a neighbor.

10:33.409 --> 10:38.457
The neighbor came over and called for 911, got an ambulance out there.

10:39.298 --> 10:40.640
The next thing I knew, I woke up.

10:41.121 --> 10:42.844
It was in March of 81.

10:43.244 --> 10:49.113
Doctors were telling me I had just come out of a two-month coma after they had to do emergency brain surgery.

10:49.313 --> 10:51.156
I removed my right temporal brain lobe.

10:51.457 --> 10:55.282
because they found out I had contracted a rare viral encephalitis.

10:55.302 --> 11:02.311
I want to go back, backtrack, because there's a part of your military career that I want you to talk about when you were at Scott Air Force Base.

11:02.952 --> 11:11.243
And as we said, you didn't serve in a combat role in any foreign country, but you did go to Vietnam on a few occasions directly from Scott Air Force Base.

11:11.704 --> 11:15.729
Talk about that, and I believe the first time you went, you thought you were just going to be gone for a few hours.

11:15.809 --> 11:19.995
Yes, I got an order that morning.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.965
I was sitting at the breakfast table with our children and my wife.

11:23.586 --> 11:24.206
The phone rang.

11:24.246 --> 11:25.448
My wife answered the phone.

11:25.508 --> 11:26.829
She said, Bill, it's Colonel Griggs.

11:27.289 --> 11:28.250
I want to talk to you.

11:28.270 --> 11:33.395
Well, I instantly stood at attention in my own home and went over the phone and said, yes, sir.

11:33.415 --> 11:38.199
He says, Sergeant Hammerford, we need you at the check-in at the base ASAP.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.160
We've got a mission for you.

11:40.421 --> 11:41.021
I said, yes, sir.

11:41.041 --> 11:44.484
So I told my wife and children I'm going.

11:44.645 --> 11:48.548
They've got a mission for me to go pick up a person that needs a ventilatory support.

11:49.118 --> 11:52.042
and I'll be back sometime this afternoon, so I thought.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.526
I got to the base.

11:54.546 --> 11:59.674
They herded me into the big military aircraft, and we took off.

12:01.016 --> 12:06.724
About 40 minutes to an hour into the flight, the pilot came over the intercom.

12:07.485 --> 12:08.667
He said, welcome aboard, gentlemen.

12:09.368 --> 12:11.371
Our next stop, Saigon, Vietnam.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.474
I just about died.

12:13.935 --> 12:15.076
I said, whatever.

12:15.156 --> 12:17.640
I just told my kids and everybody I'd be back this afternoon.

12:19.105 --> 12:28.295
Well, what those people had planned for me at the base was a test run, see how I was going to handle that.

12:29.196 --> 12:39.087
Because I had teased them and talked to them all the time, when am I going to get to go on the next air vac flight to pick up a disabled or a veteran?

12:40.208 --> 12:41.790
They said, we'll let you know.

12:41.850 --> 12:42.731
Sergeant, we'll let you know.

12:42.851 --> 12:45.093
I just kept bothering them.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.796
Well, they made a great big

12:48.299 --> 12:52.866
two-hour circle.

12:52.886 --> 12:56.892
And the captain came on the intercom and says, hey, gentlemen, we're just about to be ready to land.

12:57.713 --> 12:58.574
Fasten your seatbelts.

12:58.654 --> 13:05.725
I said, boy, that's a fast trip from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, to Saigon, Vietnam.

13:06.025 --> 13:09.190
They've got some powerful airplanes nowadays.

13:09.590 --> 13:10.932
We landed, and I started looking around.

13:10.952 --> 13:12.615
I said, man, this looks awful familiar.

13:13.696 --> 13:15.238
We landed at the Scott Air Force Base.

13:15.299 --> 13:17.682
I got out, went back up to my command post,

13:18.387 --> 13:25.036
opened the door, and there my OIC, NCOIC, and all the guys I worked with were just dying laughing.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.680
They had a big joke.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.305
Well, did you enjoy your trip to Vietnam, Sergeant Hamilton?

13:31.325 --> 13:32.347
I was so angry.

13:32.507 --> 13:36.572
If I hadn't been a good Christian, I'd have murdered every one of them.

13:36.592 --> 13:38.735
But eventually, I believe you told me you did, actually.

13:38.816 --> 13:39.456
Yes, yes.

13:40.117 --> 13:41.079
You did take the whole trip.

13:41.159 --> 13:43.162
I did take the whole trip.

13:43.302 --> 13:44.624
Right, 18-hour trip, I believe.

13:44.644 --> 13:47.027
Yes, and pick up...

13:49.100 --> 13:51.163
Wounded U.S.

13:51.183 --> 14:01.140
soldiers, military, Marine, Air Force, Navy, that were required ventilatory assistance, iron lung or volume ventilators.

14:01.420 --> 14:09.353
And I picked up them and brought them back to Scott Air Force Base, where they were dispensed to some of the civilian hospitals.

14:09.755 --> 14:19.686
Bill, there's a very special story that you told me about when you were in the coma for two months and a vision that you had.

14:19.706 --> 14:22.930
And I want you to tell it to our audience the same way you told me.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.033
All right.

14:26.053 --> 14:33.321
At one point in time, I found myself in the most beautiful place I had ever seen in my life.

14:35.424 --> 14:37.346
Crystal blue skies above me.

14:37.386 --> 14:39.188
Temperature was absolutely divine.

14:40.450 --> 14:44.495
There was white puffy clouds about waist deep that I was walking through.

14:45.717 --> 14:55.430
I was walking towards a person faced away from me in a scarlet white robe, hair about mid-shoulder.

14:56.691 --> 14:59.075
I knew I had to touch this person to live.

14:59.776 --> 15:01.558
I don't know why, but I had to.

15:02.079 --> 15:09.208
Way off in the distance, it seemed like the Norman Tabernacle Choir were singing, Shall We Gather at the River?

15:10.117 --> 15:14.162
I kept walking and stumbling and falling, getting back up, walking, stumbling, and falling.

15:14.883 --> 15:19.649
And finally, I got close enough to the back of this person to reach up and touch his shoulder.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.314
Just as I was reaching up to touch his shoulder, he turned around and grabbed my hand.

15:23.975 --> 15:26.938
I fell on my knees instantly and said, God, please don't let me die.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.241
I have two young children I want to see grow.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.385
He pulled my hand and said, Stand on your feet, my son.

15:33.306 --> 15:33.987
You will not die.

15:34.027 --> 15:35.209
I have a purpose for your life.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.453
I want you to go now, Bill, and write me a book.

15:39.260 --> 15:40.963
Call your book, The Long Road Back.

15:42.044 --> 15:49.516
Tile your story into my Bible scriptures so it would be an inspiration to other people on their long road back too, to my son Jesus.

15:49.536 --> 15:52.580
Go now, Bill, and write your book.

15:53.221 --> 15:55.665
And that is the time that I came out of the coma.

15:56.337 --> 15:57.498
And you're still writing the book.

15:57.518 --> 15:58.279
I'm still working on it.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.180
You're working on it.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.123
It's still a work in progress.

16:01.223 --> 16:01.944
It is.

16:01.964 --> 16:06.509
You, as we alluded to earlier, you sing, you write poetry.

16:06.890 --> 16:08.772
You brought a few of your short poems.

16:08.812 --> 16:11.095
I'd like for you to share them with us.

16:11.155 --> 16:11.775
Can you do that?

16:11.855 --> 16:12.516
All right.

16:12.536 --> 16:16.481
If these are some of the poems and these are inspirational and religious poems.

16:16.601 --> 16:16.781
Go ahead.

16:16.801 --> 16:19.965
This is a prayer poem that I wrote a few years ago.

16:20.738 --> 16:25.723
I've put it to music, I sing it with, play it with my guitar, but it goes like this.

16:25.743 --> 16:28.425
It says, Here I am, O Lord, again on bended knee.

16:29.707 --> 16:35.492
I come to you, my Lord, forgive me, please, for I have sinned another day.

16:35.512 --> 16:41.798
Gee, it's hard to make it your way, but I know if I pray, you'll help me make it another day.

16:41.818 --> 16:42.679
In Jesus' name.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.083
And you have a Christmas gift for him also.

16:47.553 --> 17:00.227
Yes, the first Christmas given to mankind was a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, laying in a manger so small, but he was the greatest gift of them all.

17:00.247 --> 17:14.623
God gave us his son so small, he came to free us from death's cold grip and provide us a way for eternal life, away from the sin of man and away from fear.

17:17.000 --> 17:30.466
how small he was laying in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes, but he will someday be dressed in a golden robe and the same robe what waits for you and me if we believe in Jesus Christ.

17:30.486 --> 17:31.468
That's fantastic.

17:31.488 --> 17:34.393
And these are just a few of the samples of the things that you've written.

17:34.413 --> 17:36.898
I know you have a whole computer full of them, right?

17:37.081 --> 17:39.665
I looked through them, but it seems like I'm missing some of them.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.206
I don't know.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.309
I'm going to have to start rewriting some more of them.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.413
And you take established poems and sometimes change the words to them a little bit.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.715
Can you do Humpty Dumpty for us?

17:46.735 --> 17:47.937
You do that for some kids?

17:47.957 --> 17:48.157
Oh, yeah.

17:48.197 --> 17:51.842
Well, this has come about with my volunteer work at Fannin Elementary School.

17:51.882 --> 17:52.724
Right, you're a host volunteer.

17:52.744 --> 17:54.086
And a host reading volunteer.

17:54.246 --> 17:54.506
Right.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.131
A little boy asked me if I had any poems, rhymes, or riddle I've written.

17:58.792 --> 17:59.273
I said, yes.

17:59.393 --> 18:00.955
I asked him a question.

18:00.975 --> 18:03.800
I said, how many have heard the poem of Humpty Dumpty?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.502
All these little hands go up.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.084
I said, well, let me see if you hurt it this way.

18:08.705 --> 18:12.073
Humpty Dumpty really sat up in a tree.

18:12.093 --> 18:15.260
But you know that turkey fell off backwards and broke his left knee.

18:16.342 --> 18:18.347
Then he jumped back up and said, tee, hee, hee.

18:18.648 --> 18:20.131
You can't hurt Humpty Dumpty.

18:20.612 --> 18:22.537
I'm a poet, and I know it.

18:22.557 --> 18:23.940
My feet show it.

18:23.960 --> 18:24.942
They're long fellas.

18:25.327 --> 18:28.518
And the little boy in the back, he said, Mr. Bill, who's that Longfellow dude is?

18:28.679 --> 18:30.224
I said, you mean who is Longfellow?

18:30.244 --> 18:31.529
He said, yeah, who that dude is.

18:32.050 --> 18:32.994
I said, he's a poet.

18:33.014 --> 18:34.178
You'll learn about him in high school.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.703
He said, well, did he have big feet?

18:35.944 --> 18:37.108
I said, it was about like that.

18:37.645 --> 18:39.948
And the teacher said, Mr. Bill, you're going to blow their mind.

18:40.429 --> 18:43.213
I said, well, better in here in the classroom than out there on the street.

18:46.257 --> 18:47.238
You're a host volunteer.

18:47.298 --> 18:49.361
You also are the assistant chaplain.

18:49.381 --> 18:50.142
You were the chaplain.

18:50.182 --> 18:52.786
You're assistant chaplain of the Disabled American Veterans.

18:52.806 --> 19:00.216
And I want you to talk about that organization because we haven't had near enough chances on Veterans of the Valley to talk about the DAV and the chapter here locally.

19:00.236 --> 19:04.142
Talk about Disabled American Veterans and your membership and some of the things that you all do.

19:04.282 --> 19:05.904
All right.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.146
I joined the chapter...

19:07.548 --> 19:13.877
Shortly after I moved down here to live with my mother and dad, which were elderly at the time, and I was bored stiff.

19:13.917 --> 19:14.898
I didn't have anything to do.

19:14.918 --> 19:15.800
I couldn't drive.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.103
I didn't know anybody.

19:18.123 --> 19:25.112
So mother and dad suggested I try to locate someone that might be in charge of one of the veterans organizations since I was a veteran.

19:25.713 --> 19:27.536
So I started looking around.

19:27.616 --> 19:30.220
I contacted a man by the name of Floyd D. Wells.

19:31.101 --> 19:35.547
Found out he was a commander and started the chapter 200 of the Disabled American Veterans.

19:36.556 --> 19:37.818
about 30 years ago.

19:38.959 --> 19:44.226
So I got ahold of Floyd, and we made a contact to meet, and I joined the chapter right off the bat.

19:44.506 --> 19:50.114
And our chapter is made up of about 200 or 300 disabled vets.

19:50.134 --> 19:56.362
We have a ladies auxiliary that is very functional when we have parties and gatherings.

19:56.382 --> 20:00.127
They make cookies and cakes and stuff like that for our chapter meetings.

20:00.147 --> 20:02.850
We meet once a month for our chapter meeting, business meeting.

20:03.657 --> 20:10.937
A week before that, we have an executive meeting, which I'm part of, and we plan the meetings and the things that we're going to be doing.

20:11.679 --> 20:18.257
We have various fundraisers to raise funds for the chapter because all our members are disabled

20:19.115 --> 20:21.198
And they're getting up in years.

20:21.238 --> 20:25.723
We have through World War II, most of the Korean, Vietnam era.

20:27.345 --> 20:30.108
So they're not making an abundance of money.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.912
So we have to raise money for our chapter.

20:32.932 --> 20:43.164
We have in the past going to Waco VA Hospital, which is a psychiatric hospital of the Veterans Administration.

20:43.445 --> 20:43.705
That's right.

20:44.005 --> 20:51.903
Many people don't like to go up there because of being a psychiatric hospital, but we found those people, they need love and hope too.

20:52.405 --> 20:53.688
So we go up there as a chapter.

20:54.449 --> 21:01.626
Our ladies auxiliary make cookies and cakes and punch, and we have a big party for them, and they just love it, sitting around talking old times.

21:02.213 --> 21:09.041
and it gets them out of their shell so they can express themselves and just be with other friendly comrades.

21:09.361 --> 21:10.743
Right, right.

21:10.763 --> 21:11.944
It's a wonderful organization.

21:12.044 --> 21:13.646
I know you all do a lot of volunteer work.

21:13.666 --> 21:14.687
I really enjoy it.

21:14.707 --> 21:20.113
And we also mentioned that you were a host volunteer, which is the Bryan ISD volunteer program.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.035
A lot of people may not know what host means.

21:22.556 --> 21:25.739
Host stands for help one student to succeed.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.824
We work one-on-one with a student that's having trouble with reading.

21:29.804 --> 21:37.253
or that's disabled or handicapped, and they have planned activities each day for the children to go through.

21:37.273 --> 21:43.962
It's just an hour once a week that I spend with them, but that is an hour in heaven, because I just love it.

21:44.743 --> 21:52.332
And the children have been very instrumental in giving this old man some neat ideas of children's story titles to write.

21:52.733 --> 21:55.997
I write children's stories, but it's been a long time since I've been a kid.

21:56.602 --> 21:58.984
And they give you some neat ideas about what they wanted.

21:59.004 --> 22:02.548
You know, one little boy says, why don't you talk about the monsters that ate Manhattan?

22:03.269 --> 22:04.890
I said, oh, I bet he had a tummy ache.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.515
Host is a wonderful program.

22:09.555 --> 22:12.137
My wife is a host volunteer, and she's very proud to be one.

22:12.738 --> 22:15.401
It goes on and on, the things that you do.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.963
You're also a member of the Silver Tongue Toastmasters.

22:18.023 --> 22:18.784
Talk about that group.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.606
Yes, the Silver Tongue Toastmasters.

22:20.626 --> 22:22.828
I've been a member for about 10 or more years.

22:23.416 --> 22:27.040
We give prepared speeches or extemporaneous speeches.

22:27.900 --> 22:32.925
If you're not prepared for a speech, you better be prepared to do something because sometimes the Toastmaster will call on you.

22:34.247 --> 22:35.348
Mr. So-and-so or Ms.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.651
So-and-so, would you come up and give a speech, a three-minute speech on something or other?

22:38.671 --> 22:39.812
He may call out something.

22:41.134 --> 22:46.799
The part of the meeting that I enjoy the most is an area called table topics.

22:46.819 --> 22:50.503
The table topic master will reach in his bag and pull up something.

22:51.074 --> 22:52.937
It may be something you're very familiar with.

22:52.977 --> 22:54.680
It may be something you've never seen in your life.

22:55.121 --> 22:59.127
And you have to give a one to two minute speech on it.

22:59.147 --> 23:05.377
The last time, one time I went up there, I won Best Tabletopist when he pulled up this thing I had never seen in my life.

23:06.479 --> 23:11.206
I got up there, I said, well, obviously, folks, this is one of those hoochie jiggers.

23:12.048 --> 23:15.934
Now, hoochie jigger, by definition, is something in between a watchamacallit and a doodad.

23:16.420 --> 23:20.680
But don't confuse it with a thingamajig or gizmo because they're all a little bit different.

23:20.861 --> 23:24.760
But I went on and on and on and met my one or two minute

23:25.094 --> 23:27.978
speech and won best tabletop for that evening.

23:27.998 --> 23:28.939
It's a lot of fun.

23:29.219 --> 23:30.481
I can imagine that you did.

23:31.222 --> 23:40.854
As I'm going through my notes, I wanted to backtrack because I know that you, we mentioned the city of Houston and you spent some time in Houston after your seizure.

23:40.874 --> 23:45.080
And it was something that was tough to go through, but it's something that really sort of saved your life too.

23:45.100 --> 23:49.105
It was a re-entry program in Houston that taught you to live independently.

23:49.225 --> 23:51.388
Talk a little bit about that.

23:52.043 --> 23:55.787
Project Reentry at Del Oral, P-R-E.

23:57.369 --> 24:06.699
It was headed up by Mary Helen Hayden, a Ph.D., neuropsychologist, and Nancy Leslie, a practicing psychologist here in town.

24:07.701 --> 24:08.862
It was a one-year program.

24:10.143 --> 24:14.628
The main thing they taught me or worked with me on was independent living.

24:14.648 --> 24:16.110
They knew I wanted to live by myself.

24:17.018 --> 24:24.626
So they taught me how to live by myself, and that was a godsend, because without the problem, I would have definitely been in a rest home, because I couldn't take care of myself.

24:24.646 --> 24:33.455
When I first came out of that coma, I couldn't, I didn't remember how to tie shoes, dress myself properly, cook food.

24:33.475 --> 24:46.148
So they taught me all that stuff, and then I spent one year there, and it was a very good experience.

24:46.600 --> 24:55.250
I have a habit and still a bad habit of myself of getting lost without a short-term memory and no peripheral vision.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.853
Well, I can be walking and I'll get lost real quick.

24:58.554 --> 25:11.069
So one day I went out walking in Houston, the big humongous city of Houston, remembering what my mother and dad told me that people in Houston may not be as friendly as little Brian.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.831
So be careful what you do and what you say.

25:13.392 --> 25:16.135
So I was walking down the sidewalk and this lady,

25:16.317 --> 25:19.722
On the other side of the street, we're walking down the other way.

25:19.742 --> 25:21.144
And of course, old Bill, what does he do?

25:21.164 --> 25:22.166
I said, hello there.

25:22.186 --> 25:23.307
He said, come here.

25:23.327 --> 25:24.429
So I walked across the street.

25:24.449 --> 25:25.511
She goes, where are you going, big boy?

25:25.531 --> 25:26.832
I said, trying to find my way home.

25:27.193 --> 25:27.894
She says, where do you live?

25:27.914 --> 25:28.675
And I gave her the address.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.538
She goes, oh, that's about five miles from here.

25:30.698 --> 25:33.923
She said, why don't you come up and stay with me tonight, big boy?

25:35.766 --> 25:36.547
Well, it dawned on me.

25:36.567 --> 25:37.468
The good Lord spoke to me.

25:37.488 --> 25:38.730
He said, Bill, you're talking to one of those

25:39.115 --> 25:40.577
I understand.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.260
Ladies of the evening.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.965
And so I booked myself back on home.

25:46.006 --> 25:48.429
Luckily, the good Lord helped me find my way back home.

25:48.449 --> 25:50.192
I don't know how, but I found my way back home.

25:50.352 --> 25:51.594
Bill, we just have a couple of minutes left.

25:51.614 --> 25:52.976
I want you to talk about your family.

25:52.996 --> 25:56.121
You have a son and a daughter-in-law in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

25:56.241 --> 25:57.002
Is that right?

25:57.022 --> 26:00.728
And a daughter and a son-in-law who are in Abilene, the town you grew up.

26:01.029 --> 26:01.970
And talk about what they're doing.

26:01.990 --> 26:02.972
I think it's interesting.

26:03.653 --> 26:06.557
Heather and John are both ordained Methodist ministers.

26:07.010 --> 26:12.518
And they're pastoring the church that I was baptized in as an infant and married in in 1969.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.082
They're pastoring that church.

26:15.102 --> 26:17.486
In the same church that you grew up in.

26:17.546 --> 26:17.947
Yes.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.591
And you have four grandchildren and one on the way, is that right?

26:21.011 --> 26:25.018
Yes, I've got four grandchildren, one on the way, and they're all boys, and I've got another boy on the way.

26:25.599 --> 26:29.565
And I asked my son, Brad, I said, when are you Michelle going to have me a granddaughter?

26:29.605 --> 26:30.486
He goes, not us, Dad.

26:30.652 --> 26:32.336
We're finished having babies.

26:32.356 --> 26:33.840
I said, oh, did you have a best act to me?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.023
Does she have tubes tied?

26:35.043 --> 26:37.549
He goes, no, Dad, I did something a lot better and a lot cheaper.

26:37.589 --> 26:38.832
I said, you didn't move out, did you?

26:39.073 --> 26:39.654
He said, no.

26:39.694 --> 26:40.516
I said, what did you do?

26:40.536 --> 26:42.241
He said, I built bunk beds.

26:43.885 --> 26:46.872
So I'm still waiting for a granddaughter.

26:46.852 --> 26:47.973
That's fantastic.

26:47.993 --> 26:50.056
And I know that they're very, very proud of you.

26:50.216 --> 26:51.597
And we're very proud of you.

26:51.617 --> 26:52.338
They put up with a lot.

26:52.639 --> 26:53.179
That's right.

26:53.239 --> 26:55.662
And I know you have a sister in town, Sylvia Colwell.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.946
Yes, Sylvia Colwell, a retired teacher from Henderson Elementary School.

26:58.966 --> 26:59.206
Right.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.789
And you have a couple of nephews, Rick and Robbie, that are in town.

27:01.829 --> 27:02.750
Rick and Robbie Colwell.

27:02.770 --> 27:06.695
So a lot of people are taking care of you, and you take care of a lot of people.

27:06.715 --> 27:06.895
Oh, yeah.

27:06.915 --> 27:12.401
Well, thank God I've got my family here, and I've got a brother here, and he lives out by the Dansby Power Plant.

27:13.002 --> 27:13.242
Right.

27:13.282 --> 27:16.386
He's a home.

27:16.771 --> 27:18.377
redecorator, painter.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.268
Bill, we're out of time, but thank you very, very much.

27:21.288 --> 27:23.818
Appreciate everything that you do, and thank you for your volunteer work.

27:23.898 --> 27:24.380
Enjoy your time.

27:24.400 --> 27:24.942
Thank you, Bill.

27:25.883 --> 27:28.909
how to take a bad hand dealt and still win a jackpot.

27:28.929 --> 27:39.689
No, Sergeant Bill Hamilton did not carry a weapon in combat, but he nonetheless served with his medical skills and still serves in what I believe is the most honorable way as a volunteer of his time to help others.

27:40.050 --> 27:43.477
Thank you, Bill Hamilton, for your service and a life lesson well learned.

27:44.058 --> 27:44.920
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.284
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
