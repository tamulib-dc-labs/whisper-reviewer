00:04.503 --> 00:32.840
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.860 --> 00:33.801
I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:34.928 --> 00:44.418
Soon after Dale Jackson entered the Army at age 18, he was shipped off to Omaha, Nebraska for Ordnance Repair School, learning how to fix military equipment and vehicles.

00:44.899 --> 00:55.711
Just 15 months after he entered the service, on 6 June 1944, he would find himself at another Omaha, Omaha Beach, part of the third wave at Normandy on D-Day.

00:56.292 --> 01:03.079
He recalls that historical event with amazing clarity because he was there, because he was wounded there, because he served there.

01:03.650 --> 01:13.690
He says that he was there when General Eisenhower addressed the paratroopers the day before the invasion, and indeed identifies himself in one of the war's most famous photographs.

01:13.710 --> 01:20.764
We'll see that picture a little later, but right now, please welcome Bryan's Dale R. Jackson to Veterans of the Valley.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.518
Dale, it's really an honor to have you here, and thank you for your service.

01:25.118 --> 01:34.928
I want to go right to England, outside of Reading England at Bracknell, and that's where you received your training for what would be the invasion.

01:35.008 --> 01:43.116
Talk a little bit about the training that you had, what your job was going to be, and how much did you all really know of what lay ahead at that time?

01:43.136 --> 01:49.603
Really, I thought us being in England, we would be, or even at Bracknell, we

01:49.988 --> 01:52.330
getting ready to do an invasion.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.453
I didn't know just where that would be at that time.

01:56.334 --> 02:11.709
But what we got training in was the repairing of trucks, motors, transmissions, rearing differentials, and sometimes some of them had front wheels just blowed off.

02:12.430 --> 02:18.396
And we had to redo those and get other parts for them.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.337
Right, right.

02:19.925 --> 02:26.856
And because I could imagine with the invasion, there were a lot of vehicles involved in that invasion.

02:26.876 --> 02:34.468
We're gonna see a picture a little bit later on of a sort of a panoramic view of the beach and exactly how many vehicles that there were.

02:34.488 --> 02:39.216
So your job was very significant one to keep things going.

02:39.196 --> 02:41.479
Yes, that's quite right.

02:41.579 --> 02:48.948
We wanted to be sure everything was just right so that we wouldn't have anything bogged down on the beachhead.

02:49.308 --> 02:55.076
That was what the commanders have already talked to us about in our shop.

02:55.856 --> 02:55.977
Right.

02:55.997 --> 02:58.259
You were part of the third wave on Me Day.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.421
Yes.

02:59.721 --> 03:04.427
Talk about what you can recall about where you were

03:04.947 --> 03:09.479
when the first and the second wave went in, what you saw and sort of what your thoughts were.

03:09.519 --> 03:19.345
I know we're talking, we're going back some 65 years now, but what your thoughts were as you on the LST approached Omaha Beach?

03:19.696 --> 03:31.448
We didn't know really what was going to happen exactly, but we had been trained that we had to go over the side on a net.

03:32.670 --> 03:45.203
In front of me, I remember I had a friend of mine that went between the bars and the net and the boat and it crashed him, killing him.

03:45.223 --> 03:47.425
I lost my best friend that I

03:48.063 --> 03:55.322
we pair off you know in twos usually in these actions and as a result

03:55.387 --> 03:57.650
I had to pick another new friend.

03:58.270 --> 04:04.958
But after we got into that barge, my thoughts was, oh my goodness.

04:05.619 --> 04:10.345
And then shortly after that, they began shelling that place.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.970
And we sat in that barge, and that's where I lost my hearing.

04:14.990 --> 04:15.250
Right.

04:15.270 --> 04:15.911
Talk about that.

04:16.332 --> 04:18.714
Because of the shelling, because of the sound, right?

04:18.734 --> 04:19.816
Yes, that's right.

04:20.016 --> 04:22.158
The sound, and it was tremendous.

04:22.439 --> 04:24.321
It blew my ears.

04:24.341 --> 04:25.242
And I didn't

04:25.492 --> 04:29.435
hear very much after thereafter for a long, long time.

04:30.757 --> 04:36.742
But now I've got earpieces that helps me a great deal.

04:36.762 --> 04:45.950
If it wasn't for the Veterans Administration at Temple, I wouldn't have been able to hear today like I do.

04:46.370 --> 04:46.670
Right.

04:47.671 --> 04:54.537
When people today look at history and look at news clips or even see the movies that have been made,

04:55.023 --> 05:03.700
the longest day and more recently the movie Saving Private Ryan and we see it depicted the way that Hollywood depicted it.

05:04.118 --> 05:10.105
How do you depict it having been there, the actuality of the invasion of Normandy Beach?

05:10.385 --> 05:15.792
Well, I reasoned picturing it as I really seen it because I was there.

05:16.172 --> 05:16.433
Right.

05:17.374 --> 05:28.146
And when someone, I had a friend of mine that since I had been here in Texas a while said something to me about, well, where was you?

05:28.166 --> 05:31.450
And I says, I was there on the spot.

05:31.670 --> 05:32.151
Right.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.674
And he backed off.

05:35.915 --> 05:36.215
Indeed.

05:36.816 --> 05:45.184
I want to go ahead and go to some photographs right now that you've supplied us and one that you didn't supply us, but I got off the internet.

05:45.604 --> 05:49.108
Let's go ahead right now and see the young soldier.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.490
There, if you can go ahead and look at that picture.

05:51.530 --> 05:53.472
Now, tell us about that picture.

05:53.492 --> 05:54.734
That's you and your mom and dad?

05:54.754 --> 05:59.218
Yes, that's me squatting down in front of mom and dad.

05:59.553 --> 06:10.690
That's when I was at the post in Indianapolis, just on the north side, on the bypass out there.

06:10.711 --> 06:17.081
My father and mother came, because I was not to be left there very much longer.

06:17.101 --> 06:21.848
They were going to move me someplace for other training.

06:22.452 --> 06:24.654
But that was the day you enlisted, I believe you told me, right?

06:24.714 --> 06:28.898
Yeah, that was the day I was enlisting.

06:29.178 --> 06:39.427
I said my piece as what I was to be and what I was to do and all of this.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.970
While we have your dad's picture up there, I want you to tell us.

06:43.190 --> 06:46.893
You had told me about what your dad told you after you were drafted into the Army.

06:47.434 --> 06:48.014
Oh, yes.

06:48.194 --> 06:51.177
After I was drafted in the Army, my father...

06:51.815 --> 06:56.821
come outside and he said, let's take a walk, son.

06:57.281 --> 06:59.063
And I says, what for, Dad?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.186
I want to talk to you a bit.

07:01.666 --> 07:12.539
So he put his arm over my shoulder and he said, son, I want you to be able to listen up while you're in the service.

07:12.559 --> 07:16.243
And he said, I want you then to do what you're told.

07:16.343 --> 07:18.025
It might save your life.

07:18.494 --> 07:29.692
And then thirdly, he said, you'd better follow suit all the way through in these three instances because that's what may keep you alive.

07:31.194 --> 07:31.655
Good words.

07:32.115 --> 07:35.200
Let's go on to, we've got a couple of other young pictures.

07:35.701 --> 07:36.402
Now that's...

07:37.360 --> 07:39.944
Was that after you came home or is that before your service?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.230
That was just after I came home.

07:44.552 --> 07:48.057
And by the way, I was a P.S.C.

07:48.077 --> 07:48.398
then.

07:48.558 --> 07:48.839
Right.

07:51.523 --> 07:52.144
See the stripe.

07:52.204 --> 07:52.505
Okay.

07:52.705 --> 07:53.626
Let's go on to the next one.

07:54.448 --> 07:55.229
And there you are again.

07:55.469 --> 07:56.792
That's me again.

07:56.812 --> 08:02.701
I guess folks wanted me alone at that time and point.

08:02.721 --> 08:02.962
Right.

08:03.503 --> 08:03.823
Right.

08:04.934 --> 08:06.416
And this next photograph, I believe.

08:06.496 --> 08:07.417
Oh, now here we go.

08:07.437 --> 08:09.018
This is your brother Dick and your sister.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.963
That's my brother Dick and sister.

08:12.983 --> 08:21.432
And he had already been in the service and was home because he had to come home after being blown out of a tank.

08:21.672 --> 08:22.693
Right.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.115
He was in a tank.

08:24.135 --> 08:26.818
He was in the tank corps of Patton.

08:26.838 --> 08:26.958
Right.

08:26.978 --> 08:30.942
And he and his sergeant was blown out of the top of that tank.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.052
And his men were killed.

08:34.672 --> 08:36.254
But he was coming home.

08:36.355 --> 08:42.503
He went through Paris, New York City, and then finally he got to come home.

08:43.003 --> 08:49.372
But when he went back, he went back to New York City to be in the hospital for another hitch almost.

08:49.492 --> 08:49.793
I see.

08:50.133 --> 08:51.795
I think the next picture is you and him together.

08:51.895 --> 08:52.937
There you all are together.

08:52.977 --> 08:55.320
You're on the right on that picture, and he's on the left.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.221
Yeah, Dick and me.

08:56.682 --> 08:56.862
Yeah.

08:58.597 --> 09:01.420
Now, this next photograph is one that I got off the Internet.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.686
This is 6 June 1944, the invasion.

09:05.706 --> 09:11.252
And I picked this picture because it really depicts the amount of equipment.

09:11.272 --> 09:15.858
We've seen so many pictures of just the beach or depictions of the beach and the soldiers coming up the beach.

09:16.458 --> 09:27.632
But the amount of the equipment coming off of the LSTs and coming onto the beach, and this is the type of equipment that you were there to repair and to keep going, right?

09:27.732 --> 09:28.553
That's correct.

09:30.659 --> 09:32.462
pretty fascinating picture.

09:32.482 --> 09:36.749
Now this photograph, I would imagine that everybody recognizes this picture.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.874
It's one of the most famous photographs from World War II.

09:41.797 --> 09:50.872
Talk about what you remember about this scene and the young man in the back that we've put a little indicator over his head.

09:51.673 --> 09:52.495
That's Dale Jackson.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.516
That's you.

09:53.536 --> 09:54.658
What do you recall about

09:55.263 --> 09:59.487
about this and General Eisenhower coming and talking to the troops.

09:59.507 --> 10:13.319
I tell you, this told all of us that were there, I'm certain, that that man had some passion for his men that he was leading or commanding.

10:13.339 --> 10:25.270
And when he spoke with us, he says, boys, you're going to be going in to a fire that actually you've never seen before.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.474
And he says, I want you to be watchful.

10:29.494 --> 10:30.675
You've been trained.

10:31.536 --> 10:37.803
Now be watchful and go through and let's have us a great victory.

10:38.703 --> 10:40.285
And that's the way he put it.

10:41.346 --> 10:43.608
I want people to think that we're not aware of history.

10:43.748 --> 10:52.337
Obviously, General Eisenhower was actually addressing there on the front line members of the 502nd paratroopers of the 101st Airborne.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.906
your unit was there to back them up, to support them.

10:56.407 --> 11:01.416
And you found your way right there almost in the front row for his speech.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.519
We was just behind them.

11:03.539 --> 11:04.942
Right, right.

11:04.962 --> 11:13.116
And I believe that my internet tells me that was at a place called Greenham Commons Airfield, which was very near Bracknell where you trained.

11:14.218 --> 11:16.502
An amazing picture and there you are.

11:16.735 --> 11:33.109
The next picture is coming up on the beach, and while you can't be 100% certain, this is certainly a depiction of what you saw and where you were, and you believe that you're in this picture, and that if you are, that you're the soldier on the right.

11:33.129 --> 11:34.030
Yes, yes.

11:34.270 --> 11:34.510
Right.

11:35.011 --> 11:45.460
You obviously weren't posing for any pictures at that time, but while you can't be 100% certain, even if that's not you, this is certainly a good depiction of what you experienced, right?

11:46.486 --> 11:46.887
Yes.

11:50.531 --> 11:51.413
Incredible photographs.

11:52.955 --> 11:55.157
Indeed.

11:55.177 --> 11:58.902
Okay, the landing at Normandy, at the beach.

11:59.764 --> 12:06.713
Talk about the landing and what you experienced sort of after the landing before you got to the back.

12:06.733 --> 12:11.179
And I know that, and you were wounded, really, soon after you landed.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.861
Tell us about that.

12:12.881 --> 12:13.402
All right.

12:13.902 --> 12:15.244
After we landed,

12:15.612 --> 12:31.444
I was down below and as we had set in that barge, we were shelling and it was deepening and I got up on the shore

12:32.183 --> 12:41.156
I was in a mud hole and I slipped and fell, but that was because an enemy bullet had hit me in the hip on the right side.

12:42.177 --> 12:46.143
And, of course, I didn't know the damage, but I was in a mud hole.

12:47.505 --> 12:51.391
My sergeant just looked down on me and said, Lieutenant, are you hit?

12:51.411 --> 12:53.854
I said, yes, come and get me.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.417
I'm in a mud hole.

12:55.437 --> 12:57.780
Come and get me out of this mud hole.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.461
And, you know,

12:59.015 --> 13:06.163
He ordered, he did and he carried me up just like I was just a little tiny top.

13:06.963 --> 13:22.259
I tell you that guy was, that sergeant was real big and heavy and strong because he carried me to the top, put me in his Jeep and told his driver to drive me to the mesh unit up on the plateau.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.702
And after that I

13:25.272 --> 13:50.812
All I remember of that is that bullet was pulled out, but they told me they were not going to touch that hip and told me then, don't let any doctor ever operate on that hip because it's a bleeder and you'll be on blood thinner and have been on for some time and you're going to have a lot of trouble.

13:51.092 --> 13:52.174
Right, right.

13:52.812 --> 13:57.244
Not only were you a mechanic to fix the vehicles, but you were a truck driver.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.407
Yes.

13:58.427 --> 14:02.738
And you said that you drove many a truck in combat.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.021
Yes, I did.

14:04.121 --> 14:09.790
In combat and blackout times, too.

14:09.810 --> 14:12.514
We had to draw no lights, no nothing.

14:12.754 --> 14:15.218
We was in blackout, totally blackout.

14:15.238 --> 14:15.498
Right.

14:16.139 --> 14:20.365
And we had to drive in some of these conditions.

14:20.385 --> 14:25.072
And sometimes it required us just creeping.

14:25.092 --> 14:26.594
And it was dangerous.

14:26.614 --> 14:26.915
Right.

14:27.796 --> 14:28.096
Right.

14:28.437 --> 14:31.341
And one of the times that we

14:31.709 --> 14:35.039
were hauling in some parts and supplies.

14:35.139 --> 14:44.588
We were parked under a tree with them, and then we off to the side a ways in order that we might

14:44.973 --> 14:51.099
be able to have a 30-gallon can of hot water for some coffee.

14:52.180 --> 15:04.332
And we decided we'd have a meal, which would be none other than the box of spatial things that the government furnished.

15:04.472 --> 15:07.555
Right, the delicious stuff, right?

15:07.996 --> 15:09.157
Yeah, boy.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.878
But we had all of that.

15:11.079 --> 15:14.642
And I don't know...

15:15.095 --> 15:34.221
While we was doing all of this, while we had a happening one time, and one of the times we were out like that, we had a truck that was, we looked up and we'd just seen parts and arms and things they didn't want.

15:34.261 --> 15:37.726
What they was after was ammunition.

15:37.746 --> 15:43.414
And they were Germans, and they were throwing everything else off.

15:44.052 --> 15:50.787
And I just told the boys, I said, the drivers, I said, let's get ready now.

15:50.807 --> 15:52.571
On three, you know what I mean.

15:53.714 --> 15:56.340
One, two, three, switch.

15:57.029 --> 16:01.917
And we blowed those trucks and everybody that was on them off.

16:01.937 --> 16:05.522
We had, of course, then after that, we had to walk back.

16:05.723 --> 16:06.464
Right.

16:06.484 --> 16:07.986
And that's... That's right.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.670
So to eliminate the enemy, you had to blow up.

16:10.931 --> 16:12.293
We had to eliminate them.

16:12.353 --> 16:13.174
Right, right.

16:13.194 --> 16:16.059
So that they would not get the parts, get the equipment.

16:16.159 --> 16:16.780
That's right.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.861
And you walked back.

16:17.881 --> 16:19.885
We walked back.

16:19.905 --> 16:22.108
And when you got back...

16:23.270 --> 16:45.531
you were you were praised for your action right yes we were this is something that some of the men were concerned about we we're going to get into trouble because we just let it happen i says no you just leave it to me and i i talked to the commander and the commander said what happened dale i told him

16:46.203 --> 16:51.252
And he said, well, that's to be expected in battle.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.838
And I praise you, fellas, for all of you.

16:54.898 --> 16:57.543
You didn't let them get those units.

16:57.563 --> 16:59.426
Right.

16:59.446 --> 17:03.453
Another incident that was very significant in your service.

17:03.673 --> 17:11.687
You were talking about that, I guess you were a driver, and you had taken one of the lieutenants, Lieutenant Smith, to the officer club, and on your way home,

17:12.342 --> 17:14.606
Talk about what happened and who you met up with.

17:14.626 --> 17:17.832
This was at Wiesbaden, Germany.

17:17.852 --> 17:21.558
You were a jeep driver, right?

17:21.578 --> 17:28.090
I was a driver and I drove a Lieutenant Smith in a jeep to his officers club.

17:29.051 --> 17:33.118
Coming back, I looked up and there was a bug.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.863
A bug is nothing but a VW.

17:36.384 --> 17:37.506
It had all of the

17:37.992 --> 17:47.245
Windows in those bugs that was manufactured that day, they were a part of the cow park.

17:47.265 --> 17:52.832
And they were looking over the front glass and they were firing at me.

17:53.573 --> 17:59.882
I grabbed my Jeep wheel and sped a little bit, turned it over on the curb.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.788
made a fort out of it.

18:01.808 --> 18:03.631
When they passed, I took them out.

18:04.412 --> 18:05.534
With a submachine gun?

18:05.554 --> 18:06.415
Submachine gun.

18:06.475 --> 18:07.577
I had a submachine gun.

18:07.637 --> 18:15.949
I grabbed it as I jumped out of it and then come back real quick like and I took those three suckers out.

18:15.989 --> 18:17.411
They laid on the van.

18:17.772 --> 18:24.181
It wasn't but just a few minutes after that that the MPs were on us.

18:24.702 --> 18:25.262
Right.

18:25.282 --> 18:26.164
Every one of them.

18:26.184 --> 18:27.726
And so...

18:28.415 --> 18:30.577
He said, don't say your name.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.321
Don't say your unit.

18:35.022 --> 18:36.324
Don't worry about your Jeep.

18:36.664 --> 18:38.686
We'll get it back to the compound.

18:39.107 --> 18:40.308
You get in the middle Jeep.

18:40.348 --> 18:43.011
We'll guard you until we get you back to your compound.

18:43.932 --> 18:45.393
And that's the way it went.

18:45.414 --> 18:46.475
And I got in there.

18:49.078 --> 18:52.902
We got over there and we walked into the CQ quarters.

18:53.022 --> 18:56.886
And just as soon as I got in there, he said,

18:57.457 --> 19:00.180
Now, Jackson, what in the world was you doing?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.123
What have you done wrong?

19:03.143 --> 19:09.409
That's his only answer he ever made when he thought he could get at somebody.

19:09.429 --> 19:12.252
He said, what have you been doing wrong?

19:12.272 --> 19:12.893
What happened?

19:14.054 --> 19:23.143
And so about that time, the young major said, you'll see that old goat jump to stiff like a bullard.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.100
And over in the corner, I had a friend of mine who was a buck sergeant.

19:27.500 --> 19:32.045
He was grinning like a cat eating a dish of fish or something.

19:32.065 --> 19:35.188
But anyhow, he dropped the grin.

19:35.208 --> 19:42.436
And we've had that as a good laugh for a lot of times.

19:42.556 --> 19:47.742
But I tell you, it... And what did the Major say?

19:48.403 --> 19:48.703
Pardon?

19:48.823 --> 19:49.744
What did the Major say?

19:50.044 --> 19:50.965
The Major told him.

19:51.005 --> 19:52.607
He says, Sergeant Major.

19:53.448 --> 19:54.850
I want to tell you something.

19:54.870 --> 20:01.840
This man, I just got him out of a lot of problems too.

20:01.860 --> 20:06.165
But I'm not going to charge him with that at all.

20:06.185 --> 20:08.088
And you're not going to do it either.

20:08.449 --> 20:15.338
Because I'm going to say unto you right now, oh, 400 hours in the morning, I want that man headed stateside.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.336
And if he isn't, your backside's going to belong to me.

20:21.779 --> 20:24.683
Because these were enemies that they'd been after for a while.

20:25.023 --> 20:25.344
Is that right?

20:25.584 --> 20:25.864
Yes.

20:26.064 --> 20:26.205
Yes.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.329
They'd been chasing them for three or four weeks, I guess.

20:30.610 --> 20:32.873
And they kept evading them.

20:33.514 --> 20:33.634
Right.

20:33.654 --> 20:37.860
We didn't let them evade us.

20:38.340 --> 20:38.981
So you came home.

20:39.302 --> 20:40.063
Yeah.

20:40.563 --> 20:40.764
Yeah.

20:40.844 --> 20:44.228
Next morning on 0400 hours, I was...

20:44.596 --> 20:50.224
I was on a truck, headed out.

20:50.244 --> 20:52.267
I was in the back end of it.

20:52.287 --> 20:53.668
Boy, that was a rough ride.

20:54.570 --> 21:04.964
But finally it was shifted over to a weapons, not a weapons carrier, but a command car.

21:05.725 --> 21:09.730
And we began to come into Le Havre, France.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.633
That's a port of debarcation.

21:12.558 --> 21:22.951
You came home from your service, and in the time that we have left, I want to talk about sort of your career after the service.

21:22.971 --> 21:24.112
You're a minister.

21:24.132 --> 21:24.472
Yes.

21:25.273 --> 21:27.136
Talk about that and how that came to be.

21:28.337 --> 21:38.329
Well, I was in a church, I believe it was the Church of the Nazarene, and

21:38.832 --> 21:52.725
I wanted to go to school, and so we went up to one of their colleges for some training in the essence of preparedness of a minister.

21:52.745 --> 22:00.712
Now, I had finished all but two years of my high school, but what I did, I took two years.

22:01.253 --> 22:07.239
I took, along with my college work, I took high school and got a diploma.

22:07.459 --> 22:07.759
I see.

22:08.448 --> 22:14.896
from a high school, and then when I ended there, I got a diploma from that college.

22:15.977 --> 22:36.362
And then I went to another university, and after a while, we finally were going into, this was in Indianapolis, and then I went to Christian Theological Seminary

22:36.967 --> 22:40.813
for a year and a half after four years in that university.

22:41.614 --> 22:55.414
And then when my son, one of my sons wanted to go to college, he come to me and my friend and wanted to know if we could get him down to the

22:56.002 --> 22:59.926
Asbury College, he said, I've heard a lot about that.

23:00.006 --> 23:01.067
I want to go there.

23:01.967 --> 23:06.952
And so my friend Luther and I said, well, that's a good school.

23:07.372 --> 23:10.015
So what we did, we took him down there.

23:11.456 --> 23:25.148
And then he said to me, Dad, why in the world don't you just get into the seminary over there and then you can come and room with me?

23:25.415 --> 23:30.723
I had to pay for, mom and I had to pay for the room anyway.

23:31.584 --> 23:35.310
And so I stayed, I lived with him all the time.

23:35.390 --> 23:42.782
He was there and went to the seminary.

23:42.942 --> 23:43.162
Right.

23:43.823 --> 23:50.894
How did your World War II service and what you had seen in World War II, how do you think that that helped you?

23:50.914 --> 23:54.139
How did that serve you in your ministry later on?

23:54.862 --> 23:59.854
Well, I'll tell you, that served well.

24:01.357 --> 24:07.292
I, at 14 years of age, was called to the preaching ministry.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.356
I never forgot about it.

24:09.457 --> 24:09.597
Mm-hmm.

24:10.083 --> 24:22.596
Then after I became 15 years of age, some of the colleagues that had me in that youth camp wanted me to speak for them in their churches.

24:23.176 --> 24:36.610
I spoke, I gave evangelistic services up and down, up until I was 18 and then went into the service.

24:37.631 --> 24:39.853
But these are some of the things that

24:40.627 --> 24:55.133
actually made me have the spirit that Christ has come to forgive us and to help us as we walk and live our lives.

24:55.153 --> 25:00.222
And we've continued on until it was finished.

25:00.775 --> 25:05.561
Actually, you said that your mom knew you were gonna be a preacher early on, right?

25:05.581 --> 25:11.788
Yes, I forgot about that a little bit here, but that's right.

25:11.868 --> 25:24.503
Any time any one of the ladies or family or anyone come in, when I was a small lad, mom was holding me on her lap and she says, this is my preacher lad.

25:25.504 --> 25:27.627
So that was put in my mind.

25:27.607 --> 25:30.133
Pretty bad, pretty badly.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.336
So she knew early on.

25:31.616 --> 25:42.983
Oh yeah, I think mothers and daddies and all other individuals that know us real well know what's going on.

25:43.148 --> 25:48.494
And as a matter of fact, I believe that you're the, or you have been the chaplain of the VFW here locally.

25:48.514 --> 25:51.138
Yes, I've been for seven years now.

25:51.298 --> 25:54.321
I've been a chaplain with the VFW.

25:54.882 --> 26:00.769
It gives me something to do and a night out and I enjoy the fellowship.

26:01.570 --> 26:02.671
Indeed, indeed.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.313
Talk about your, we have just a couple of minutes left.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.755
Talk about your family.

26:05.775 --> 26:09.780
And I know that your wife is, you and your wife live in Bryan.

26:10.537 --> 26:12.239
And you have children.

26:12.499 --> 26:14.742
Talk just who they are and talk about your family.

26:15.022 --> 26:16.324
And how long you've been married?

26:16.944 --> 26:20.368
Well, Betty and I have been married.

26:20.388 --> 26:23.472
It will be this coming October 26th.

26:23.552 --> 26:24.593
We will be married.

26:25.574 --> 26:29.719
I believe it's going to be something like about 52 years.

26:29.839 --> 26:30.219
Okay.

26:30.880 --> 26:39.430
And I'll tell you, Betty has and I have been married.

26:40.220 --> 26:49.307
years, all those years, and these two sons has been around us and with us.

26:49.327 --> 26:52.677
One of them has been with us mostly all the time.

26:53.146 --> 26:56.211
but the other boy had been in the service.

26:56.751 --> 27:10.532
He finally came home, but his commanding officer called one day and said, I wonder, Mr. Jackson, if you can send your son right directly home.

27:10.612 --> 27:13.577
And I says, well, yes, he'll have a home for us.

27:13.597 --> 27:15.660
Well, all right, he is on his way.

27:16.417 --> 27:20.220
So he put him on a bus and sent him, shipped him down to Texas.

27:21.622 --> 27:25.625
But that was homecoming.

27:25.645 --> 27:25.966
Indeed.

27:26.566 --> 27:29.429
Your story is indeed a remarkable one.

27:29.989 --> 27:33.973
It is one, and I know that it's a service that you're very proud of.

27:33.993 --> 27:35.014
Yes, I am.

27:35.034 --> 27:36.335
And we're very proud of your service.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.477
And thank you for telling it here on Veterans.

27:38.497 --> 27:44.702
Well, I appreciate doing this, and I appreciate you asking me to do it.

27:44.722 --> 27:45.343
It's an honor.

27:46.302 --> 27:56.759
Among World War II's most unforgettable images are the landings at Normandy, at beaches called Utah, Gold, Juneau, Sword, and Omaha.

27:56.779 --> 28:05.372
6 June 1944 is the day that Dale Jackson will never forget, and we pray that history will never allow our children or their children to forget either.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.275
We salute Dale Jackson for his service.

28:07.957 --> 28:08.878
I'm Tom Turbyville.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.382
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:22.685 --> 28:35.243
you
