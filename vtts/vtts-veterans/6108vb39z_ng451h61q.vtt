Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.871 --> 00:33.193
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:33.680 --> 00:44.550
Texas A&M class of 1948, Bob Spoede is an author, a former professor, one of the staunchest A&M sports supporters you'll ever find, and a veteran of the Vietnam War.

00:45.273 --> 00:49.878
He was older than most, 38 years old, when he first arrived in country in Vietnam.

00:49.898 --> 00:52.400
Meet Dr. Bob Spoede of College Station.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.523
Bob, it's a pleasure to have you on the show, and thank you very much for your service.

00:56.084 --> 00:56.625
Let's go back.

00:56.745 --> 01:01.469
You were born near Wallace, Texas, right just a mile from the banks of the Brazos River.

01:01.489 --> 01:07.516
Talk a little bit about your growing up, where you grow up, and what eventually brought you to Texas A&M.

01:07.536 --> 01:13.862
Well, I was born, as I said, in October, just after cotton-picking time on the cotton farm in Texas.

01:14.078 --> 01:16.162
out on the Brazos Valley.

01:16.543 --> 01:20.691
And my father was German extraction.

01:20.711 --> 01:24.939
My mother was a typical pioneer stock.

01:25.319 --> 01:30.249
But we moved across the river to other land right across the Brazos River into Fort Bend County.

01:30.269 --> 01:34.076
So I started my education in Simonton, Texas for two years.

01:34.096 --> 01:36.120
And then being the Depression,

01:36.353 --> 01:58.210
my father had achieved a reserve commission and kept it active uh he got it in world war one and kept it active during the 20s and into the 30s and then president roosevelt started the civilian conservation corps program the ccc and he needed army officers to honcho that so he was called to active duty so we moved

01:58.645 --> 02:04.031
from Fort Bend County to Lufkin, Texas, where he was a sub-district commander.

02:04.051 --> 02:08.836
And then we moved a lot and they wondered if some bill collector was chasing us maybe.

02:09.477 --> 02:14.703
We moved from Lufkin to Waco and from Waco to Marshall and from Marshall to Fort Worth.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.446
We were living in Fort Worth from Pearl Harbor time.

02:17.906 --> 02:21.430
And then we moved to San Antonio where my father was Provo Marshall.

02:21.899 --> 02:25.783
of all the places other than the military bases in San Antonio.

02:26.123 --> 02:32.350
He had to keep peace and order among the 500,000 military types within 50 miles of San Antonio.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.752
You graduated from Thomas Jefferson in San Antonio.

02:34.772 --> 02:36.054
And I graduated from Thomas Jefferson.

02:36.274 --> 02:41.099
And in 1944, I came to A&M.

02:41.119 --> 02:48.126
My brother had been lost as a Marine Corps fighter pilot flying off Guadalcanal in the summer of 1943.

02:48.612 --> 02:52.358
and I wanted to join the Marines immediately upon graduating high school.

02:52.919 --> 03:01.012
My mother asked me to get one semester of college, and I honored her because I knew she was grieving and mourning for my brother.

03:01.793 --> 03:05.319
And so I said I would, and they kept their word.

03:05.399 --> 03:12.691
And when I finished one semester at A&M, I went back to San Antonio and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

03:13.973 --> 03:15.936
And they said, well, we have so many here,

03:16.557 --> 03:17.979
waiting to be called up.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.942
We think you could probably get another semester of college.

03:19.962 --> 03:28.193
We recommend you go back and re-enroll for the second semester in the fall of 1944, which I did, and I finished that semester, and then I went to the Marines.

03:28.213 --> 03:28.694
Yeah.

03:28.714 --> 03:30.076
I want to go back to when you entered.

03:30.096 --> 03:33.480
You actually enrolled at Texas A&M on D-Day, June 6, 1944.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.542
I was standing in line.

03:35.042 --> 03:39.689
I was standing in line enrolling when General Rudder was climbing the cliffs of Horn to Hawk.

03:39.709 --> 03:39.949
Wow.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.377
And so that's what, I mean, my job was a lot less dangerous than his.

03:43.617 --> 03:44.298
What was the campus?

03:44.318 --> 03:46.801
What was the town, the community like in the mid forties?

03:46.821 --> 03:51.467
Well, the community was, there were farms between College Station and between A&M.

03:51.567 --> 03:56.453
I hardly call it College Station or town, but there were farms between here and Bryan.

03:57.914 --> 04:00.958
There was no downtown College Station.

04:01.867 --> 04:08.716
I worked on the battalion and we had a Monday morning sports report kind of show for about five minutes.

04:09.238 --> 04:11.387
And we laughingly would say,

04:11.671 --> 04:13.654
welcome to downtown College Station.

04:13.694 --> 04:16.699
And we'll try to picture where downtown College Station might be.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.682
The closer we could come to it was Northgate.

04:19.162 --> 04:22.207
Well, people still can't find downtown College Station.

04:22.247 --> 04:23.729
So not a lot has changed then.

04:24.450 --> 04:33.624
You did, after a while at Texas A&M, you did leave the school and you did become active military, active actually in the Marines before you came back to Texas A&M.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.267
And you went to Germany, I know, too.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.409
Talk about sort of that span.

04:36.449 --> 04:39.453
Well, when I came back, I re-enrolled in ROTC.

04:39.614 --> 04:40.615
Now I was...

04:40.595 --> 04:43.661
in the junior level ROTC.

04:43.841 --> 04:50.274
I was a freshman in, I mean, I was a sophomore academically, a junior in ROTC and a senior in privileges.

04:51.316 --> 04:59.852
But then after about a year, the professor of military science came in in my branch, came in and said, the army started a new program called the

05:00.288 --> 05:04.137
distinguished military students and distinguished military graduates.

05:04.157 --> 05:08.467
And if you have such and such qualifications, we will designate you a distinguished military student.

05:08.487 --> 05:16.626
And if you maintain it until you graduate, you will be called a distinguished military graduate and the army will tender you a regular army commission.

05:16.606 --> 05:18.409
which was a lifelong dream of mine.

05:18.429 --> 05:21.634
It was like somebody come in and say, you want your dream?

05:21.935 --> 05:22.916
Just come up and get it.

05:22.937 --> 05:23.177
Right.

05:23.477 --> 05:25.461
And so I was up there getting it real quickly.

05:25.741 --> 05:26.242
Absolutely.

05:26.382 --> 05:32.613
And so I then went in the army when I graduated from A&M in June, the first of June, 1949.

05:32.653 --> 05:34.075
And, uh,

05:34.763 --> 05:38.049
went to basic training, then went a three-year tour in Germany.

05:38.069 --> 05:38.971
Exactly.

05:38.991 --> 05:40.233
And you went to Germany.

05:40.914 --> 05:43.659
You were in Germany about the entire span of the Korean War.

05:43.679 --> 05:44.240
Absolutely.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.062
Perfect span.

05:45.122 --> 05:46.625
Because you chose to go to Germany.

05:46.685 --> 05:51.674
Had you chosen to go to Japan, you would have been in line to bypass Japan and go on to Korea.

05:52.295 --> 05:52.776
Right.

05:52.796 --> 05:52.956
Yeah.

05:53.637 --> 05:57.885
One of the ironies was that when I went through basic training,

05:58.507 --> 06:04.739
The young married officers in their first year of marriage tended to be asked for Japan.

06:04.759 --> 06:07.183
The bachelors tended to ask for Germany.

06:07.203 --> 06:10.469
The reason is in Japan, quote, you never went in the field.

06:11.591 --> 06:14.777
You should stay at home with your little young bride.

06:14.757 --> 06:22.929
But if you went to Germany, you spend six months a year on the field because everybody knew that the Russians were going to come across into West Germany at any moment.

06:22.949 --> 06:23.169
Right.

06:23.590 --> 06:28.797
But when you got leave, you could go to Paris, you could go to Riviera, you could go to Italy.

06:28.837 --> 06:31.801
There were so many things to do in Germany when you did have a time off.

06:32.402 --> 06:35.727
If you were in Japan, what could you do after you've seen the mountain?

06:35.747 --> 06:36.608
Yeah, exactly.

06:38.271 --> 06:39.512
So you went to the more fun spot.

06:39.532 --> 06:43.498
So I asked for Germany and got Germany.

06:43.900 --> 06:52.749
But I was on pre-overseas leave and all of a sudden the word came out that North Koreans have come down to South Korea and President Truman ordered the army in it.

06:52.769 --> 06:59.755
So all of my friends didn't even stop in Japan, but went right in.

06:59.775 --> 07:01.357
And some of them were very sad stories.

07:02.118 --> 07:07.503
Joining troops they didn't know and not having any bond, a commitment to them.

07:07.723 --> 07:11.086
And I lost a lot of friends in Korea.

07:11.327 --> 07:11.747
Exactly.

07:11.913 --> 07:16.278
but I went to Germany, which was supposedly the dangerous place, but it turned out to be the safe place.

07:16.438 --> 07:16.879
Right.

07:16.899 --> 07:18.481
You were in the 16th Infantry in Germany.

07:18.501 --> 07:19.382
I was in 16th Infantry.

07:19.402 --> 07:21.244
Talk about what your job was there.

07:21.264 --> 07:31.837
In 16th Infantry, I started off as a platoon leader, second lieutenant platoon leader, moved up, became a company executive officer, then a company commander, and then a battalion staff on the S-1.

07:32.438 --> 07:34.921
Then I rotated home in 1953.

07:35.601 --> 07:38.545
From 50 to 53, I was in Germany, and when I got home,

07:38.947 --> 07:44.146
During my post-overseas leave, the shooting stopped in Korea.

07:44.969 --> 07:50.830
So it started when I was on my pre-overseas leave and it ended when I was my post-overseas leave.

07:51.063 --> 07:58.133
You left Germany, you came back, you were at what is now known as UT Arlington, I guess it was called what, Arlington State College?

07:58.153 --> 07:59.255
Arlington State College, yes.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.357
As an ROTC instructor.

08:00.377 --> 08:01.999
You were part of the Indian system at that time.

08:02.139 --> 08:02.820
I see, I see.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.544
You were an ROTC instructor at that time, right?

08:05.584 --> 08:06.245
Yes, right, right.

08:06.646 --> 08:09.630
And then you went infantry school, you went to Fort Benning.

08:10.071 --> 08:15.058
You also had nearly a year in Korea after the Korean War was over.

08:15.259 --> 08:20.867
I had over a year, I had 16 months in Korea, right on the DMC,

08:21.185 --> 08:23.627
and right on the Imjin River.

08:24.148 --> 08:30.514
And as I said, when I came out of my hooch, I'd look across the valley and on the other side was North Korea.

08:30.534 --> 08:32.075
I could see North Korea from where we were.

08:32.355 --> 08:33.056
Right, right.

08:33.236 --> 08:41.624
And I have a picture somewhere that some manning our positions right on the line there with the trenches and dugouts and all this stuff.

08:41.644 --> 08:45.047
And eventually you went back to Germany for three years in the 24th Infantry.

08:45.207 --> 08:47.269
I went back with my wife and family.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.251
By this time I was married, had three children.

08:49.653 --> 09:04.725
and went back to Augsburg, Germany, and spent three years in the 34th Infantry Regiment and the 19th Infantry Regiment, and also division headquarters as G2 plans in division headquarters, and spent three years in Augsburg.

09:05.583 --> 09:11.268
1965, you went to Fort Hood then, and then in 1965, you went to Vietnam.

09:11.288 --> 09:13.951
You were 38 years old when you went to Vietnam.

09:13.971 --> 09:18.395
That obviously is older than most soldiers when they went over to Vietnam.

09:18.735 --> 09:19.836
I was a professional soldier.

09:19.856 --> 09:21.557
I was a rather senior major.

09:21.678 --> 09:28.083
I had been executive officer of the 1st Battalion of the 41st Mechanized Infantry at Fort Hood.

09:28.223 --> 09:33.328
And I went over there as an advisor to the Vietnamese Army.

09:34.051 --> 09:40.361
But I was a sudden, I was part of the earliest buildup under President Johnson in the Vietnamese war.

09:40.982 --> 09:42.685
Emergency requisition of troops.

09:43.546 --> 09:46.410
And there were only 25,000 when I arrived.

09:46.471 --> 09:48.253
There were 300,000 when I came home.

09:48.594 --> 09:49.255
Right.

09:49.275 --> 09:52.861
You were stationed in the Central Highlands, the coastal plains of South Vietnam.

09:53.341 --> 09:53.462
Right.

09:53.482 --> 09:54.924
And as a military advisor.

09:55.204 --> 09:55.385
Right.

09:55.785 --> 09:58.690
Talk a little bit about what your various duties were in Vietnam.

09:58.710 --> 10:00.092
I know you did a lot of traveling.

10:00.612 --> 10:01.253
Yeah.

10:01.273 --> 10:03.996
Well, I didn't do any traveling for pleasure, particularly.

10:04.016 --> 10:05.377
No, that's what I mean.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.760
You were going from base to base a lot.

10:07.780 --> 10:08.080
Yeah.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.762
Well, we were stationed in Khantoum.

10:11.304 --> 10:23.517
We were advising and we had under our advising the section, sector we were in, the outpost, the army regiment up at Docto, which is north of Khantoum.

10:23.797 --> 10:24.257
Right.

10:24.277 --> 10:25.138
And they were attacked.

10:25.198 --> 10:26.620
So we helicoptered up there.

10:27.157 --> 10:41.055
And then later the special forces camp at Duco came under attack and we had control of that operation of controlling to relieving the special forces with Arvin forces at Duco.

10:41.075 --> 10:47.543
Arvin is Army of the Republic of Vietnam, but commonly called among GIs at the time, Arvin.

10:48.184 --> 10:54.312
And so we did that and then play me special forces camp came under siege and we oversaw that as well.

10:54.848 --> 11:04.920
And then we also kept Highway 19, the Manyang Pass, open during the Iodrang Valley conflict.

11:05.620 --> 11:10.025
I wasn't at Iodrang Valley, but I heard the cannon and I heard the cannon.

11:10.065 --> 11:17.975
We were close enough to hear it, but our job was to keep the supply route from the coast to Pleiku open.

11:18.215 --> 11:19.236
Right.

11:19.418 --> 11:28.311
Hydrange Valley, I think the people who have read the book or seen the movie, We Were Soldiers, or the book, We Were Soldiers and Young Men, that's the area.

11:28.472 --> 11:30.760
That's the Hydrange Valley campaign, right.

11:30.780 --> 11:30.981
Right.

11:31.231 --> 11:35.456
Right, that General Hal Moore commanded at that time.

11:35.476 --> 11:36.918
I think a lot of people have seen that movie.

11:37.539 --> 11:38.960
You said it was kind of ironic.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.242
You had done two tours of Germany.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.824
You'd done a tour of Korea.

11:42.324 --> 11:46.109
But it wasn't until you got to Vietnam that you really got an idea of what combat was all about.

11:46.129 --> 11:47.651
It was the first combat that you saw.

11:48.071 --> 11:50.955
And it opened your eyes that this was for real.

11:51.235 --> 11:52.817
They weren't playing games.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.097
Yeah.

11:53.478 --> 11:55.240
And, you know, I'd seen a lot of practice things.

11:55.300 --> 11:59.685
I'd seen fortifications that we did and other, you know.

11:59.665 --> 12:09.959
But when I flew into Saigon for the first time, and I looked down, now Ho Chi Minh City, I looked down and I saw the little triangular forts and so forth.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.762
I said, those are for real.

12:12.163 --> 12:14.706
Those are not practice or training exercises.

12:15.167 --> 12:22.517
And then at night when I put my head down the pillow in the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, and I hear the cannon shooting.

12:23.122 --> 12:25.165
And I thought they don't have a safety officer on them.

12:25.185 --> 12:28.309
They're trying to kill people out there.

12:28.589 --> 12:31.533
And so they don't care where they fall.

12:32.615 --> 12:34.037
Oh, you talk about jobs.

12:34.077 --> 12:40.385
Another job I had was, you know, planning what we call seeding areas of the countryside.

12:41.106 --> 12:50.479
When I didn't talk, we didn't talk about this before, but I plot areas, rectangles on the map where the B-52s would come in and drop,

12:50.898 --> 13:04.572
delayed time bombs, 500 pound bombs that would be delayed up to two weeks in length, trying to deny that area to the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese.

13:04.592 --> 13:08.957
And you're walking through the jungle, then a 500 pound bomb go off, it could ruin your whole day.

13:10.118 --> 13:10.538
Indeed.

13:12.160 --> 13:17.465
You talked about Vietnam and many times when we were talking earlier, you described it as a weird war.

13:17.886 --> 13:19.167
It wasn't weird.

13:19.400 --> 13:25.345
There would be combat going over in one area, and there'd be people playing tennis in another area.

13:26.466 --> 13:28.888
Talk about Vietnam, the weird war, as you observed.

13:28.908 --> 13:29.529
It was a weird war.

13:29.629 --> 13:33.792
I never ate as well as I ate in Vietnam at times.

13:33.813 --> 13:41.299
I ate sea rations at times, but when I was in Garrison, on Sunday afternoon, we could pick out as many steaks as we wanted them and charcoal grill them.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.141
And I had a nice bed.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.803
I slept under four blankets at night.

13:45.823 --> 13:48.225
It was cool where we were up in the Central Highlands.

13:48.847 --> 14:05.893
But this one time, particularly, we got word that about 5,000 of the bad guys were coming into the north side of Khantoum, and we were separated from our counterparts, the Vietnamese army people, over by several miles.

14:05.913 --> 14:11.762
They were on the northeast corner of Khantoum, and we were on the northwest corner of Khantoum.

14:12.743 --> 14:17.250
And we'd run and got into our bunker, our concrete reinforced bunker,

14:17.872 --> 14:24.244
And the senior advisor for Colonel looked at me and said, well, Bob, we're supposed to be advising people over there.

14:25.586 --> 14:28.611
Do you want to go over there and be with our counterparts?

14:29.974 --> 14:32.098
And I said, sir, you use the wrong word.

14:32.919 --> 14:33.781
Do I want to?

14:34.382 --> 14:35.564
No.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.005
Will I?

14:36.325 --> 14:37.247
Yes.

14:37.430 --> 14:53.363
So we got in the Jeep and we started going out of our compound and, you know, with our helmets on and grenades and all this stuff you see and looked over there and here were some people from agricultural advising people out playing tennis under light tennis courts.

14:53.849 --> 15:00.279
And I thought the odds were 60, 40 at least that I was going to be dead in the next 15, 20 minutes.

15:00.460 --> 15:01.021
Right.

15:01.041 --> 15:05.268
But it turned out the intelligence report was in error, and we got over there safely.

15:05.608 --> 15:08.132
You thought, boy, the last thing I'm going to see is people playing tennis.

15:08.152 --> 15:11.297
People playing tennis in Vietnam, yeah.

15:11.338 --> 15:14.022
I mean, it's that kind of 8 to 5 born away.

15:14.643 --> 15:15.624
At times, it wasn't, though.

15:16.386 --> 15:16.566
Right.

15:17.035 --> 15:22.040
I wanna go back to your Vietnam experience in a little bit, but let's go ahead and go to some pictures now that you supplied to us.

15:22.060 --> 15:26.644
You have a great scrapbook that your wife has put together for you.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.086
I wanna let you know my wife was very jealous of that scrapbook.

15:29.106 --> 15:30.248
It was very well put together.

15:30.588 --> 15:37.314
And a lot of these photographs that we're about to see actually came from that scrapbook and also some other photographs.

15:37.334 --> 15:40.197
So let's go ahead and take a look at some of these pictures.

15:40.217 --> 15:40.637
There we go.

15:41.178 --> 15:42.719
There is a very young Bob Spoede.

15:42.739 --> 15:44.061
About how old were you there?

15:44.081 --> 15:46.603
I guess I was about 12, 11 or 12.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.585
Probably in Waco or somewhere.

15:49.766 --> 15:50.307
Yeah.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.089
I'd recognize you right off.

15:52.129 --> 15:53.530
I'd recognize you anywhere.

15:54.471 --> 15:55.352
Thank you.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.095
You have almost as much hair now as you did then.

15:58.115 --> 15:58.215
Yeah.

15:58.235 --> 15:58.495
Okay.

15:58.716 --> 16:01.719
Let's move on to the next picture.

16:02.399 --> 16:05.503
I was in high school at ROTC, Thomas Jefferson High School.

16:05.903 --> 16:11.409
I put on the uniform when I was 14 years of age and wore until I was, until I retired in 1968.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.490
1968.

16:15.305 --> 16:27.116
This was an article from the battalion that shouted out the news that Bob Spoede and Bill Potts would share the duties of the bat sports editor.

16:27.136 --> 16:34.043
And that first paragraph, I'm trying to remember exactly.

16:34.804 --> 16:36.425
They talk about all the places I lived.

16:36.866 --> 16:38.167
Yeah, that's what it was.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.289
There was something very funny about that first paragraph.

16:40.329 --> 16:43.492
It's hard to read it right now, but it was talking about you.

16:43.512 --> 16:44.333
But that's...

16:45.022 --> 16:47.806
Chuck Mazel, I noticed that.

16:47.846 --> 16:49.729
Is he in your relation to Ivan Mazel?

16:50.029 --> 16:50.770
I don't know.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.713
I just noticed that last name.

16:52.733 --> 16:56.238
He's a sports writer in Texas.

16:56.258 --> 16:59.262
But anyway, that's an article.

16:59.302 --> 17:02.146
Also, in 1948, I went to visit my parents.

17:02.366 --> 17:04.269
We didn't talk about this before.

17:04.289 --> 17:08.434
In Germany, and they sent me over to see the Olympics in London.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.978
And I had a

17:11.532 --> 17:16.157
battalion sports card, a press card, you know, from the battalion.

17:16.998 --> 17:22.965
And they were having a demonstration by the divers on diving, just a demonstration, not a competition.

17:23.726 --> 17:28.111
And I wanted to see it, but I didn't have a ticket.

17:28.131 --> 17:33.237
So I went up to the gate and flashed the battalion sports pass.

17:33.638 --> 17:34.980
And they let me into the thing.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.161
He just waved me on in.

17:36.181 --> 17:41.549
And so I went in and I came back and told the sports information director at the time, Dub King.

17:41.829 --> 17:42.049
Right.

17:42.069 --> 17:43.571
And he thought that was so hilarious.

17:43.591 --> 17:46.014
He put it on the Associated Press wire, you know.

17:46.515 --> 17:48.077
Here's another picture we're looking at.

17:48.097 --> 17:50.240
That's your dad swearing you in.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.342
Talk about that picture.

17:51.362 --> 17:54.065
Well, in summer of 1948, I went to Germany, as I mentioned.

17:54.466 --> 17:57.730
My father commanded a railway security battalion.

17:57.750 --> 18:01.435
He guarded railway shipments, his battalion did, military police battalion.

18:01.870 --> 18:08.863
And I'd finished my work for, at the end of my junior year, and I was eligible to get my reserve commission.

18:09.564 --> 18:11.668
And so he swore me in for my reserve commission.

18:11.708 --> 18:16.858
And then later, a year later, I got my regular army commission.

18:17.142 --> 18:19.985
You had to be a college graduate to get the regular Army commission.

18:20.005 --> 18:21.366
What was your father's name?

18:21.386 --> 18:22.247
Herman H. Spoede.

18:22.307 --> 18:23.168
Herman Henry Spoede.

18:23.188 --> 18:31.316
And he served in World War I. He served in World War I and got his commission through OCS in World War I and kept it active during the 20s and into the 30s.

18:31.336 --> 18:33.398
Here's a photograph that was lifted from that scrapbook.

18:33.418 --> 18:35.520
Where were you there?

18:35.540 --> 18:36.001
Do you recall?

18:36.021 --> 18:41.186
That was, looks like in Vietnam, in Korea.

18:41.326 --> 18:41.767
In Korea?

18:42.107 --> 18:43.048
Looks like, yeah.

18:44.294 --> 19:07.365
i can't see the background very well okay let's move on to the uh to the next one well that's where he is an army officer young army officer oh that was from just before i got married i see and uh i was just returned from germany right i got my wedding picture made bob and his wife nancy there there you are on your wedding day which uh

19:08.037 --> 19:11.521
By the time that we're viewing this, you will have been married already 53 years.

19:11.921 --> 19:13.282
Right, yes.

19:13.383 --> 19:14.884
That was in February?

19:14.924 --> 19:17.327
February the 8th, 1954.

19:18.268 --> 19:23.173
We met after I came back from Germany on August the 30th, 1943.

19:23.833 --> 19:24.835
She's a very pretty lady.

19:24.855 --> 19:27.217
Just like she was then, she is now.

19:27.237 --> 19:27.758
Yeah, I agree.

19:28.158 --> 19:29.199
Yeah, I bet you do.

19:29.559 --> 19:30.761
Here's some pictures from Vietnam.

19:30.781 --> 19:31.862
What are we looking at there?

19:31.882 --> 19:37.808
Oh, that's where we were keeping the Mang Yang Pais open, and we were sitting on the sticks.

19:37.923 --> 19:42.168
and in what they called a regional force company outpost.

19:42.188 --> 19:54.302
Regional force was not very combat ready, and we were living there and operating out of there, and the conditions of the people there were pretty poor.

19:54.902 --> 20:00.589
They didn't have many of the comforts of life, as you can see, and nor did we at the time.

20:01.244 --> 20:02.085
It really came out.

20:02.145 --> 20:04.748
That red dirt is very clay.

20:06.189 --> 20:09.012
It's really sticky and it stains everything.

20:09.473 --> 20:10.214
Great clay dirt.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.296
Your unit had a pet leopard?

20:12.816 --> 20:13.918
Yeah, we had a pet leopard.

20:14.298 --> 20:16.801
This is actually you holding the leopard here.

20:17.101 --> 20:17.782
I'm petting him.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.163
You're petting the leopard, right.

20:19.183 --> 20:20.264
With temerity.

20:22.187 --> 20:28.213
The compound commander had gone down to the market and bought this cub.

20:28.480 --> 20:34.747
The leopard nursed from a female German Shepherd who had pups.

20:36.148 --> 20:40.773
But the leopard did not like Vietnamese, which we liked because he was a good watch cat.

20:41.193 --> 20:41.954
A good watch cat.

20:43.276 --> 20:52.345
But they had to chain him up later on because would drop on General Auschurch going and walking around the compound and practicing his leaps and dropping on prey.

20:52.780 --> 20:54.062
Talk about this aerial photograph.

20:54.222 --> 20:55.283
What are we looking at?

20:55.303 --> 20:56.504
Oh, that's the special.

20:56.524 --> 20:59.148
That's that RFPF camp that I talked about.

21:00.029 --> 21:01.691
I think, yeah.

21:01.711 --> 21:07.818
And so that's where we were living and camping out there and operating off radios.

21:07.878 --> 21:18.370
And we were sending out helicopters to land spasmodically in the jungle and jungle clearing just to see if we could scare up any of BC or while the Iodrang Valley was going on.

21:18.390 --> 21:22.315
We didn't want anybody coming in and cutting off the supply route.

21:22.430 --> 21:24.094
into Pleiku.

21:24.374 --> 21:25.416
Right.

21:25.436 --> 21:25.717
Okay.

21:27.721 --> 21:28.022
Next one.

21:28.283 --> 21:31.089
This is the cover of a book that you have written.

21:31.269 --> 21:36.440
It's a novel called Double Identity, a Texan in Hitler's Right.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.244
A novel by Robert Spoede, as you can see.

21:39.046 --> 21:39.747
Talk about

21:40.132 --> 21:42.236
Your book, which you just finished about a year ago, right?

21:42.256 --> 21:43.237
It's published about a year ago.

21:43.518 --> 21:43.738
Yes.

21:44.299 --> 21:47.164
Well, it's about an Aggie, obviously.

21:47.725 --> 21:50.570
And I'd like to say I've had now my third career.

21:50.610 --> 21:51.973
My first career was an Army officer.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.876
My second career was a college professor.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.142
My third career, I'd like to say, was not as a novelist.

21:57.262 --> 21:58.524
I've got a bunch more in my mind.

21:58.544 --> 21:59.486
I want to get down on paper.

21:59.706 --> 22:00.027
Exactly.

22:00.047 --> 22:01.870
But this particular book,

22:02.795 --> 22:15.891
A book is a story of an Aggie who gets marooned in Germany, loses part of his leg, he can't escape, and ends up finding out he's married.

22:16.472 --> 22:24.722
The person who's impersonating is married to a German noblewoman, and it's kind of a suspense romance.

22:24.742 --> 22:26.805
And it is not autobiographical.

22:27.325 --> 22:31.030
It is purely a novel from my background of knowledge of A&M.

22:31.482 --> 22:36.574
and knowledge of Germany and knowledge of the army and army ways, military ways.

22:37.436 --> 22:43.350
And it's received some real good accolades from readers who said- Indeed it has.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.695
I'll help you sell your book here.

22:45.735 --> 22:49.845
Lieutenant General John Miller, US Marine Corps retired in College Station says,

22:49.825 --> 22:54.273
Double Identity is a great read.

22:54.333 --> 22:59.442
It has everything you could want in a book, mystery, intrigue, action, romance, and loyalty.

22:59.743 --> 23:04.371
So he liked the book and plus a whole lot of others have read it and said some great things about it.

23:04.391 --> 23:05.272
How can somebody get the book?

23:05.633 --> 23:09.219
Well, you can get the book by going to iUniverse.com.

23:09.260 --> 23:12.305
You can go and get it at Scripture Haven at the mall.

23:12.405 --> 23:13.487
You can get it at

23:13.467 --> 23:20.201
Caravelle paper books over by TJ Maxx.

23:20.342 --> 23:23.989
And you can get it at a university bookstore.

23:25.032 --> 23:27.156
And I hope to have a book signing.

23:27.507 --> 23:32.033
at the Scripture Haven sometime after this comes out.

23:32.394 --> 23:33.395
Great, great.

23:33.415 --> 23:34.978
I hope it keeps being successful.

23:35.298 --> 23:37.081
You retired from the Army in July of 1968.

23:38.002 --> 23:44.231
You got your master's at Hardin-Simmons, and then you went all the way out east of William and Mary to get your doctorate, right?

23:44.251 --> 23:44.431
Right.

23:44.571 --> 23:45.433
Yeah.

23:45.693 --> 23:47.376
And then you were a teacher.

23:47.516 --> 23:52.603
You taught in a beautiful part of the country, in Michigan, right near the lake there at Mackinac College.

23:52.735 --> 23:53.656
Mackinac College.

23:53.796 --> 23:54.537
Mackinac College.

23:54.657 --> 23:55.819
I said not nearly.

23:55.939 --> 23:56.720
It was in the lake.

23:56.740 --> 23:57.401
It's an island.

23:57.501 --> 23:58.843
Mackinac Island, Michigan.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.225
A very historic island.

24:01.026 --> 24:02.488
Old English fort was built there.

24:03.789 --> 24:06.112
And it's unbelievably beautiful.

24:07.775 --> 24:12.681
There are no cars on the island other than a fire wagon and an ambulance.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.184
Everything is by horse or by bike or by foot.

24:16.045 --> 24:19.770
And it was a wonderful year.

24:20.551 --> 24:22.033
It was started by a

24:22.503 --> 24:34.998
tried to restart it by a television evangelist, but he closed it after one and a half semester, and he got in financial troubles with various things and closed it.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.042
But it was a wonderful year's experience.

24:39.383 --> 24:40.024
I bet it was.

24:40.304 --> 24:43.768
I mean, we lived right 20 feet from Lake Huron, could hear the water laughing at night.

24:43.968 --> 25:10.228
water froze and the year we were there it was called blue ice so we could put music out on our little porch over the lake and the students could come out and ice skate out of the lake right in front of our house and we had men for coffee and i mean for donuts and hot chocolate and so it was a wonderful experience you went on to uh teach history at a college called bryan college in william jennings bryan college named for the great commoner right and it was located where the monks ghost monkey trial occurred and it was a result of that

25:10.208 --> 25:33.904
while Mr. Bryan was there in Dayton Tennessee said somebody ought to start a college for Christian young people up on one of these hills and that's all he had to say and they started collecting pledges for the William Jennings Bryan Memorial University and they had pledges from Franklin Delano Roosevelt from Al Smith from many many famous people to commitment that was started in 1925 but on the way to the bank

25:34.238 --> 25:35.720
Something happened in 1929.

25:35.860 --> 25:40.005
But nevertheless, the college got started in 1930.

25:40.185 --> 25:47.374
I cannot think of a more horrible time to try to start a college other than at the height of the Great Depression.

25:48.034 --> 25:49.096
But nevertheless, it got started.

25:49.116 --> 25:49.656
It's hung on.

25:49.676 --> 25:50.978
It's now a pretty good.

25:51.358 --> 25:53.020
It's a very good academic institution.

25:53.461 --> 25:58.727
Very tiny, which I love because I could know the names of every student on campus by the end of the school year.

25:59.534 --> 26:08.344
I know that you came back to Aggieland in 1991, and I know that you thoroughly enjoyed it, a supporter of the school you love so dearly.

26:08.384 --> 26:11.708
I know you're very active and have been in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

26:12.429 --> 26:16.554
And you try to get to every athletic event that you can, right?

26:16.574 --> 26:17.054
That's right.

26:17.214 --> 26:18.776
I came back for it.

26:18.796 --> 26:19.797
I did it when I was a student.

26:19.817 --> 26:20.278
I came back.

26:20.318 --> 26:26.605
I had a wonderful time as a student at A&M, and I came back, and I enjoyed those, and I came back.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.845
The Lord has really blessed us in the ministries we have here.

26:30.846 --> 26:35.052
Bible classes, my wife's Bible class, my Bible class, in the Bible class we lead.

26:35.653 --> 26:42.543
And it's been a wonderful time and wonderful 15, 16, 17 years of getting on toward now.

26:42.563 --> 26:42.783
Right.

26:42.884 --> 26:44.846
You and your wife, Nancy, have three children.

26:44.927 --> 26:45.287
Is that right?

26:45.307 --> 26:45.748
That's right.

26:46.108 --> 26:52.037
Rebecca Parker and David Spoede, class of 81 at the University of Texas Law School.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.399
Is that right?

26:53.419 --> 26:53.519
Yes.

26:53.739 --> 26:55.742
And also Paula Halverson.

26:56.023 --> 26:56.203
Right.

26:57.010 --> 27:00.676
And those are your- There are three children, then we have nine grandchildren.

27:00.716 --> 27:01.357
Nine grandchildren.

27:01.678 --> 27:01.898
Right.

27:02.299 --> 27:08.829
Our son's not been married, and he's failed on his duties of producing as more grandchildren.

27:09.110 --> 27:12.114
Well, just think how many we could have if he had gotten married and had about six of them.

27:12.134 --> 27:12.916
We had 15.

27:13.096 --> 27:16.141
We're out of time, Bob, but thank you very much for your service.

27:16.161 --> 27:18.124
Well, thank you very much for letting me be here.

27:18.104 --> 27:29.190
Bob Spoede and his wife Nancy have been married 53 years and spend their retirement still giving back to the community, whether it's through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes or their support of just about every Aggie athletic team.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.958
We salute Bob Spoede for his service to our country and to the Brazos Valley.

27:33.459 --> 27:34.321
