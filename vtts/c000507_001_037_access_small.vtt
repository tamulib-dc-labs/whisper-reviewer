Coming up next is the Science Fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.740
This is the Science Fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.060
And here are your hosts.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.460
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.700 --> 00:45.460
And David Cruz.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.860
Some of the most exciting science fiction being written today comes from the pen of Jack Chalker.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.180
And it's clear that he's a popular writer too, probably best known for the five books

00:54.180 --> 00:55.440
in the Well World series.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.000
In fact, the first novel in that series, Midnight at the Well of Souls, has sold over a million

01:00.000 --> 01:00.400
copies.

01:01.020 --> 01:06.380
Chalker's first book came out not that long ago, 1976, so his work is still fairly recent.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.180
He'd been active in the field though years before he started writing, corresponding

01:10.180 --> 01:16.420
with authors and other fans, attending conventions, editing a fanzine, even starting a small publishing

01:16.420 --> 01:19.440
company, Mirage Press, to produce material on science fiction.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.340
But Chalker says he'd always planned on being a writer.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.720
I'd always known I was going to be a writer.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.140
I mean, there just was never any question in my mind.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.760
But it was just sort of something that you never really sat down and did.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.180
I used to play around with stories here and there.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.060
John Campbell was a big help.

01:39.100 --> 01:45.360
During the 60s, I would float ideas and fragments off him, and he would be very, very nice and

01:45.360 --> 01:46.660
tell me exactly what was wrong.

01:46.660 --> 01:52.720
Of course, what I've created everybody about John Campbell was that the man had been editing

01:52.720 --> 01:57.480
for 40 years, and he could put his finger on something and tell you exactly what you

01:57.480 --> 02:02.460
were doing wrong, and it was terribly infuriating to discover that he was right in almost every

02:02.460 --> 02:02.860
case.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.280
He saw why he did it from 39 until he died.

02:09.180 --> 02:15.820
And as a result of being able to have the help of people like Campbell and August Arilith

02:15.820 --> 02:22.500
and a lot of really established writers and editors in the field, I was able to get a good

02:22.500 --> 02:26.580
recognition of exactly what was required in the field.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.320
It just was a matter of sitting down and doing it.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.960
And fortunately, he did sit down and do it, publishing Jungle of Stars in 1976.

02:35.960 --> 02:45.980
So I sat on a typewriter, and there was really no question in my mind as to what I'd do first.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.460
I had been playing around with an idea for years and years and years.

02:52.300 --> 02:59.740
There's even a short, fancy version of it, 20 years old, called Jungle or Jungle of Stars.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.880
There were a lot of codewords, but Jungle was always in it.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.700
And I sat down and wrote the things.

03:09.240 --> 03:09.560
I wrote it.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.780
It had been around so long in my mind and in discussions and so on that there were just

03:14.780 --> 03:20.460
no problems, no resistance, no having to think it out or anything else.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.520
And I wrote it solidly in about two and a half, three weeks.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.940
And then sent it off.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.300
And it's a good old-fashioned type.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.240
It's a science fiction murder mystery.

03:38.880 --> 03:43.120
Very much at home in the old astounding analogs.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.740
And so I didn't even know if that's some modern touches to it.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.360
Some of his earlier contacts with people in the field of science fiction paid off.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.840
One of them, Judy Lindell Ray, bought the novel.

04:00.280 --> 04:10.580
Judy Lindell Ray, who had just become editor of Ballantyne, which was soon to have a science fiction line named after her,

04:13.180 --> 04:14.140
took a look at it.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.640
We'd known each other for about 15 years.

04:17.700 --> 04:24.700
And she put off reading it for quite a long time because she was afraid that if it was terrible and she said so,

04:24.700 --> 04:27.260
she'd blow our friendship or something.

04:27.900 --> 04:33.880
Finally she said, we got together at a convention and she admitted to me all this.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.780
She said, okay, I'll read it, but be prepared.

04:36.600 --> 04:41.280
And about four days later I get a phone call and she said, hey, this is great. I want to buy it.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.180
And that was the first sale.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.680
Since then, Chalker has published some 13 novels and he's still going strong.

04:50.180 --> 04:51.920
More with Jack Chalker next time.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:04.760 --> 05:07.660
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.320
The Science Fiction Radio Show

05:53.320 --> 05:53.960
The Science Fiction Radio Show

05:55.600 --> 05:59.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:15.380 --> 06:20.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.940
And here are your hosts.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.220
This is David Cruz.

06:31.460 --> 06:32.180
And Darrell Lane.

06:32.700 --> 06:39.300
A hike through a national park and a war game board, unlikely sources for a tremendously popular science fiction novel.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.180
The novel is Midnight at the Well of Souls. The author is Jack Chalker.

06:43.620 --> 06:48.160
The book concerns the Well World, an artificial planet constructed by a vanished civilization.

06:48.160 --> 06:53.840
The Well World is divided into 1560 separate environments, separate worlds really,

06:54.440 --> 06:57.340
each with its own climate, geography and intelligent inhabitants.

06:57.860 --> 07:01.660
Each division is shaped like a hexagon, and for that reason they're called hexes.

07:02.280 --> 07:07.420
Chalker was in an isolated village called Stahikin on the shore of Lake Chelan in Central Washington State

07:07.420 --> 07:09.180
when he got the idea for the Well World.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.920
I got to sitting by the lake that night and talking with some people.

07:15.880 --> 07:25.820
And I got the idea for this large world built by a long dead race, so on.

07:25.940 --> 07:28.380
And I didn't really have much of an idea of what it was.

07:29.200 --> 07:34.160
And they do have a service out of Stahikin that'll take you up to Trailhead.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.720
And so I went up to Trailhead and I wound up walking down.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.020
I'm a great hiker as long as the direction is down.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.500
I'm afraid I've never been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon because I can get down there but I can't get back up.

07:49.220 --> 07:52.000
But here was a trail that was tailor made for me.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.640
It was down the Cascades, all the way.

07:56.980 --> 08:04.120
So I took it and it took about 8 1 half hours to walk the whole distance.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.780
And during that time you go through eight climate zones.

08:10.220 --> 08:13.760
You start off in the snow, you wind up in a rainforest.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.720
And some of the changes are rather abrupt.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.840
You just go around to switch back and it just changes from one climate to another,

08:22.920 --> 08:28.240
each with its own different plants and insects and occasional mammals.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.780
Even the birds seem to be different.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.480
And I thought, yeah, this is how that big world would be like.

08:34.420 --> 08:39.040
So even though while I was on my way down I was kind of scribbling ideas.

08:40.920 --> 08:51.620
And I got the idea for this giant world composed of basically world-like different abrupt geography, climate, landforms.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.740
You name it, each with its own dominant race.

08:57.120 --> 09:04.420
By the time I hit bottom my head had pretty well worked out, although I didn't really know what the shape of the things were going to be.

09:05.780 --> 09:09.060
Back home in Maryland he got some help on the shape of the well world.

09:10.360 --> 09:18.640
I was discussing the idea with a science fiction fan named Ben Yellow, son of the Nobel winner, Rosalind Yellen.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.700
And he said, why don't you just use an Avalon Hill game board?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.060
And I thought, yeah, that would work.

09:26.560 --> 09:33.680
So we got out an Avalon Hill map, a war game map, and a little trusty calculator.

09:34.500 --> 09:40.260
We laid a grid of these hexagons around a roughly earth-sized world.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.440
And of course you cannot cover a sphere with hexagons.

09:43.440 --> 09:52.880
So that means we had the north zone and the south zone, which would be the embassy's entry and exit points that would cover our sphere.

09:53.740 --> 10:04.840
And then it was just simply a matter of sitting down, listing what was required to do, what kind of creatures and land, climate and so on.

10:04.840 --> 10:16.360
And I would have to do for the route of the story, dropping by Avalon Hill, which I lived very near at the time, picking up some blank maps and just working it out from there.

10:17.820 --> 10:22.280
What Chalker worked out turned into his best known novel, Midnight at the Well of Souls.

10:22.860 --> 10:26.720
It was so popular that it went out of print a few months after its initial press run.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.120
And Chalker has added four novels since then, making a five book series in the well world.

10:31.120 --> 10:37.220
The whole thing turned out to be a colorful and exciting epic on the origin of the universe and all of the creatures in it.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.900
It should fascinate any reader of science fiction.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.940
More on Jack Chalker next time.

10:49.520 --> 10:58.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:01.120 --> 11:31.100
The show is now available on the web for more than a year.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:07.220 --> 12:12.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.720
And here are your hosts.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.760
This is Daryl Lane.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.760
And David Cruz.

12:24.220 --> 12:28.640
The five novels in Jack Chalker's Well World series are based on a familiar science fiction concept.

12:28.640 --> 12:34.660
And that concept is the notion of a long dead race of superior beings whose artifacts are found by humans.

12:35.140 --> 12:38.980
But there are a couple of interesting twists given to this concept by Chalker.

12:39.560 --> 12:44.700
One twist is the principal artifact by the vanished race. It's a planet called the Well World.

12:45.220 --> 12:51.020
It's artificial, and its interior is a super computer that can transform matter into all sorts of living creatures.

12:51.020 --> 12:58.140
It's really a laboratory planet where species are created and tested before being transferred to various places throughout the universe.

12:58.540 --> 13:03.640
And the other twist is that the superior beings, called the Markovians, aren't actually gone.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.040
They just transformed themselves into other, more primitive beings.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.380
Chalker talks about the Markovians.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.860
They got to the point where they were gone, literally.

13:14.280 --> 13:19.360
Where their devices could conjure up anything they wanted, just with a mere thought of it.

13:21.280 --> 13:27.740
I since had it pointed out to me that they're sort of like the Crel and the old movie Forbidden Planet.

13:28.580 --> 13:30.700
And that they reach this Godhead status.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.960
But the Crel experiment failed because they couldn't control their passions.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.440
And the Markovian experiment succeeded, and they literally became gods.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.160
Then they became miserable.

13:44.180 --> 13:47.480
There was nothing left to attain. There was nothing left to know.

13:47.660 --> 13:55.240
There was nothing left to, you know, get a bunch of creatures that spent millions of years rising to this point.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.080
And they sit around and they say, is this all there is?

13:58.400 --> 14:01.500
At this point, the Markovians decided to start all over again.

14:02.280 --> 14:08.600
The idea of the great experiment came about was to redo it.

14:08.820 --> 14:16.520
To literally start the Markovians over from scratch with different kinds of creatures, different environments.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.780
With no real value system.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.600
I mean, they have to develop their own unique value systems. They do.

14:25.480 --> 14:32.000
And as a result, they're grown and they're tested on this laboratory world, the well world.

14:32.520 --> 14:41.260
And then they were the ones that worked, the ones that showed promise of survival, were then set into motion out throughout the universe.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.340
Including man.

14:45.860 --> 14:58.480
And they had the hope that eventually one of these races would reach a state of perfection that would not be empty or hollow.

14:59.360 --> 15:05.460
Now, I personally believe that when you reach that state, it is empty and hollow.

15:06.200 --> 15:14.640
But that's just my feeling other people might certainly do think differently.

15:16.700 --> 15:21.500
The Markovians create hundreds of different species. All intelligent, but all incredibly different.

15:21.980 --> 15:25.440
We asked Chalker how he gets ideas for creating such a variety of aliens.

15:26.940 --> 15:32.760
I used a variety of things. In some cases, a good pictorial natural history text.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.580
It'll give you more weird creatures than you've ever seen.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.600
Which can be modified.

15:40.420 --> 15:41.920
Some came out of mythology.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.620
Some came more or less direct out of Fantasia.

15:47.660 --> 15:48.860
Sources like that.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.020
And a few came out of comic book concepts.

15:55.260 --> 16:00.700
You know, you just brought them in from all over and you used basic shapes and basic types.

16:00.700 --> 16:09.000
And then you adjust them to what would happen if these were real, fendient, intelligent creatures.

16:10.600 --> 16:17.320
I found very, very little trouble in coming up with an enormous variety of them.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.680
I'm not sure whether I could come up with 1,560, which is the number I would have to to visit every hex in the world.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.440
But I've had no trouble coming up with the 2,300 so far.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.060
More with Jack Chalker next time.

16:37.520 --> 16:42.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:43.040 --> 16:46.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:57.440 --> 17:27.420
The Science Fiction Radio Show is a production of the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:01.800 --> 18:07.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.420
And here are your hosts.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.480
This is Daryl Lane.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.480
And David Cruz.

18:18.900 --> 18:25.980
Before you became a best-selling Science Fiction author, Jack Chalker was an avid fan who built an amateur fanzine into a Science Fiction Publishing Company.

18:25.980 --> 18:31.200
Chalker started the fanzine in his early teens as a way of making contacts in the field of Science Fiction

18:31.200 --> 18:34.020
and with the possibility of making a little money at it.

18:35.320 --> 18:44.540
That basically was the reason we started with the fanzine, which was run off actually at a school, the beginning, because we didn't have anything else.

18:47.220 --> 18:52.200
And he'd got some reasonably good reactions, so I started building up from there.

18:52.200 --> 19:02.700
While I was doing that, actually, I had correspondence already with enormous numbers of people, both professional and fan.

19:03.600 --> 19:10.320
I had so much correspondence, I can't believe how many people I was contacting on a regular basis.

19:10.320 --> 19:26.020
And so I started tapping them and created the fanzine Mirage in the addition of a $40 surplus mini-graph in an old store, which I still own, by the way, and which still works.

19:27.860 --> 19:31.620
I was able to start putting out a fanzine called Mirage.

19:32.860 --> 19:38.740
The fanzine was successful because of its high quality, and it led into a small publishing company, Mirage Press.

19:40.520 --> 19:46.640
I was serious and constructive at the same time that everybody else was being just sort of kid hobbyist.

19:47.460 --> 19:57.540
I really had a magazine that discussed the literature, discussed the writers and so on past and present, and at a time when very few of these were coming out.

19:57.540 --> 20:04.360
And so I attracted a rather large audience of collectors and professional writers and artists and so on.

20:05.040 --> 20:22.860
And I was able to create out of that the Mirage Press, which started off, again, as a mini-graph publication, and then later grew as capital grew into a hardcover and paperback, quality paperback publishing house.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.260
Chalker says that Mirage Press was successful from the start.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.780
I started off with a bibliography of HP Lovecraft, which I did myself.

20:34.520 --> 20:58.700
Put it together, mini-graphed it with the help of Auguste Aralith, who owned the rights to the HP Lovecraft material at the time, and sold it for what in 1960 was a horrendous fee of a $1, and we sold a hundred of them.

21:00.420 --> 21:08.620
Mirage Press publishes non-fiction materials such as bibliographies and critical studies of authors. Chalker leaves the publishing of fiction to the large companies.

21:28.800 --> 21:39.500
You really have to promote fiction, whereas non-fiction and reference material is always, there's always a heavy market and there's been a growing market for it.

21:40.020 --> 21:42.220
And so I concentrated in that end.

21:43.060 --> 21:53.800
And we came up with some rather successful books, Guide to Middle Earth, which in its Valentine's form, which I still own a piece of, is still selling well in Atlasi Fantasy.

21:57.060 --> 22:02.200
We did three books on sword and sorcery fiction before the comic books discovered Conan.

22:03.900 --> 22:17.480
And occasionally we did rather odd materials, such as a collection of all of the Ferdinand Fakut bad puns that have been published over the years, this kind of thing.

22:18.600 --> 22:23.760
Mostly though we were serious reference works and we still have a number of them that are standard.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.420
Next time, more with Jack Chalker.

22:35.580 --> 22:44.260
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:32.360 --> 23:36.760
The next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:52.880 --> 23:58.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.660
And here are your hosts.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.640
This is David Cruz.

24:08.920 --> 24:09.580
And Darrell Lane.

24:10.080 --> 24:14.900
Jack Chalker's reputation was greatly enhanced by the popular, well-world series of novels.

24:14.900 --> 24:20.480
Now he's at work on a new series, one which will have four books in it entitled The Four Lords of the Diamond.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.060
Two novels have been published so far.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.100
The first is called Lilith and the second Cerberus.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.240
Chalker comments on the story.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.760
It has a tremendous number of the elements that I have become known for.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.060
It has a lot of new material as well.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.800
It has a lot of political commentary.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.620
It has a lot of social commentary in it.

24:42.620 --> 24:51.880
It has also slam bang action, Machiavellian intrigue and everything else because nobody's going to read your message if you don't entertain first.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.280
As Chalker says, the books have a lot of excitement in them.

24:56.580 --> 25:04.500
In the opening pages of Lilith, the first book in the series, a tremendously powerful alien robot penetrates a top secret military installation on Earth.

25:04.760 --> 25:09.420
The robot's discovered, but he escapes and heads for a planetary system called the Warden Diamond.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.680
The Earth government sends its top agent.

25:13.400 --> 25:19.940
These are four worlds in one system that are basically a prison planet series.

25:21.580 --> 25:28.520
You get dropped on there and the foundation idea which appealed to me an awful lot is

25:28.520 --> 25:36.980
an alien race discovers us before we discover them, decides that it can't win a war against us.

25:36.980 --> 25:44.480
Maybe they're just not as many of them or there's technological problems or something like that.

25:45.200 --> 25:53.040
So they study us and study us and they discover that as in all human societies there is this massive criminal syndicate.

25:54.000 --> 26:05.700
And that this criminal syndicate leaders are mostly imprisoned for life on the four lords of the Warden Diamond.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.480
These four worlds.

26:08.020 --> 26:18.740
So what the aliens do is they contact these bitter super crux and they take out a contract on human civilization.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.080
The agent can't land on any of the four worlds of the Warden Diamond.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.940
A tiny organism on these worlds enters the body and makes a person a virtual prisoner.

26:29.380 --> 26:34.020
Right. If you try to leave you die a painful death. There seems to be no cure for it either.

26:34.020 --> 26:41.540
So what the agent does is have his personality implanted into four separate bodies and these bodies are sent to each of the worlds.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.660
And he monitors what is happening through a computer hookup orbiting the Warden system.

26:46.800 --> 26:59.260
Part of what the book is about is that we have a sort of surrogate him down on each of these worlds who starts off pretty much are almost identical to him.

27:00.020 --> 27:05.240
And he's following this whole thing with his whole system of values, beliefs and so on.

27:05.740 --> 27:10.980
And he's watching these surrogates change into quite different people.

27:12.040 --> 27:17.500
And it begins to eat away at his own sense of values, his own sense of duty.

27:18.560 --> 27:28.540
As a matter of fact in the third book he begins to realize that the people who sent him there on this mission anticipated this.

27:28.540 --> 27:39.380
And that his computer detective aide who he has dialogues with and discusses everything with, maybe more than that it may be something of a watchdog.

27:41.380 --> 27:48.580
Chalker promises an exciting ending when the agent struggles with his own newly discovered values with the computer and with the aliens.

27:48.580 --> 27:54.480
I don't like cop-outs, I don't like stringing people along and then not delivering.

27:57.000 --> 28:06.300
You will get real, I don't know whether you can say flesh and blood but something, aliens and whatever they're made of.

28:07.340 --> 28:17.640
You will meet the aliens, you will have a face down and the solution to the whole thing and exactly what's going on is quite bizarre.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.460
And I don't think anyone's going to figure it out.

28:27.480 --> 28:36.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
