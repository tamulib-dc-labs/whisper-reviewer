00:11.500 --> 00:18.700
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.700 --> 00:20.960
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.560
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lange, and David Carson.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.760
The subject of this program is robots and mechanical men.

00:37.160 --> 00:42.200
Along with aliens and space travel, I think robots are one of the most stock of all science

00:42.200 --> 00:45.780
fiction concepts. For some people, they're probably synonymous with science fiction.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.740
We see robots throughout the entire history of science fiction.

00:49.960 --> 00:54.200
Sometimes they're a danger to man, their creator, and sometimes a benevolent and faithful helper.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.280
Today, we're exposed to them continually in the movies and on TV.

00:58.900 --> 01:04.040
And I think that's because they can be so fascinatingly visual and noisy, with glowing

01:04.040 --> 01:09.520
red eyes, squeaks, clicks, hums, whirs, and representation of media robots also make good

01:09.520 --> 01:13.640
toys to sell to kids. But as a concept and good science fiction literature,

01:13.640 --> 01:16.840
they allow for some deep and insightful examinations of the human condition.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.500
One author states that the value of robot stories is that in dealing with the man-made

01:21.500 --> 01:25.840
version of humanity, the science fiction writer is lured into considering the nature of man

01:25.840 --> 01:26.880
in its deepest aspects.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.740
Before we go into it any further, we might stop and define what a robot is and perhaps

01:33.740 --> 01:41.880
differentiate a robot from several other words that are used to describe non-human but humanoid

01:41.880 --> 01:42.500
creatures.

01:43.620 --> 01:48.240
Right. I think first of all that a robot is obviously something created, a mechanical

01:48.240 --> 01:54.660
artifact made of artificial materials like metal, plastic, rubber, wires, tubes, hydraulic

01:54.660 --> 02:01.240
fluids, whatever. It's mobile, self-contained, self-propelled, whether it uses legs, wheels,

02:01.440 --> 02:06.380
treads, or some kind of anti-gravity device. It may or may not look like a man, though

02:06.380 --> 02:07.560
it can think to some degree.

02:08.210 --> 02:13.600
The basic differences between a robot and an android are the materials with which they're

02:13.600 --> 02:22.220
built. An android is constructed of organic or living material. An android can be human

02:22.220 --> 02:25.820
in form. In fact, it can be human in form in every possible manner.

02:26.520 --> 02:33.180
Another word and category that we might also touch on is cyborg. A cyborg is not the same

02:33.180 --> 02:38.900
as either a robot or android. Cyborg is like what the $6 million dollar man was, a combination

02:39.530 --> 02:48.020
of machine with a man's mind. This can be either minimal like a mechanical hand, in

02:48.020 --> 02:53.780
some senses, people with prosthetic devices could almost be called a cyborg, or it can

02:53.780 --> 03:00.020
go on to the extremes of an entire body made up of metal and plastics and things with a

03:00.020 --> 03:01.500
mind of a human being.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.540
The idea of a man-like machine, an automaton or robot, as we mentioned before, is one of

03:10.540 --> 03:14.080
the oldest of all science fiction themes, one of the classic concepts, and it goes all

03:14.080 --> 03:20.420
the way back to Greek times. King Minos of Crete had a bronze giant named Thalus, made

03:20.420 --> 03:26.040
by the craftsman Dedalus, which Minos used to guard and patrol the island. Later in the

03:26.040 --> 03:30.740
16th century, Jewish legend developed the figure of the Golem. Though the Golem was made

03:30.740 --> 03:33.360
of clay, he could be brought to life and was a precursor of robots.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.180
Rossum's Universal Robots, or otherwise known as RUR, a Czechoslovakian play by Carol

03:40.180 --> 03:44.540
Czopek, is not the first use of robots in literature, but is the first use of the word

03:44.540 --> 03:51.420
robot. The word is derived from a word robata, meaning compulsory labor, and robotnik, meaning

03:51.420 --> 03:56.400
workman. The play dealt with robots that discover emotion and ultimately rebel against their

03:56.400 --> 03:56.760
masters.

03:58.260 --> 04:03.360
In the prelude to a collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov, eight stories from the rest

04:03.360 --> 04:09.300
of the robots, he mentions another story that seems to blend into this robot fabric that

04:09.300 --> 04:15.240
is being weaved into the modern robot stories. He mentions the novel Frankenstein by Mary

04:15.240 --> 04:21.900
Shelley as indicative of the kind of sociological background that became the robot in later

04:21.900 --> 04:30.420
stories. Here we have the age-old dream of man to create another life form himself, but

04:30.420 --> 04:36.520
this goes against all of his morals and most all of the religions who say that God is the

04:36.520 --> 04:42.940
only one who can create a life form. So then when mankind does create this life form, it

04:42.940 --> 04:50.360
turns on him and eventually destroys both itself and the people who created it. This,

04:50.440 --> 04:57.120
of course, is the idea behind Frankenstein. What Isaac Asimov decided to do was to take

04:57.120 --> 05:01.720
all of the robot stories that he had read, which were all Frankenstein complex stories,

05:02.620 --> 05:07.760
and try something different, right one where the robots would not be necessarily evil.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.020
Yeah, it's interesting that book Frankenstein, I think a lot of people identify that as the

05:13.020 --> 05:17.860
first science fiction novel that was published back in the early 19th century, but I would

05:17.860 --> 05:25.240
say probably the first modern robot story was published in 1938 by Lester Del Rey entitled

05:25.240 --> 05:30.020
Helen Alloy. Now the early robots, I think most of them were sort of mindless machines.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.680
Sometimes like Frankenstein, they got out of control and they often became a menace, but

05:35.680 --> 05:41.500
the story Helen Alloy changed that. She was a beautiful humanoid robot that was built by

05:41.500 --> 05:45.920
two inventors. And when they were constructing her, they accidentally gave her the emotion

05:45.920 --> 05:52.700
of love. And so logically, she fell in love with one of her creators. She marries him

05:53.180 --> 05:58.600
and they live a happy life together until he dies. And then she destroys herself because

05:58.600 --> 06:03.240
she loved him so much. It's a very sentimental story, but it's probably kind of identified

06:03.240 --> 06:09.780
as the first one where the robot is a sensitive creature, not simply a mindless automaton out

06:09.780 --> 06:15.620
to destroy humanity or turn on its creators. Jack Williamson has done a lot of work in

06:15.620 --> 06:20.140
this area too with robots, humanoids, androids and so forth. And he has one of the classics

06:20.140 --> 06:26.820
entitled with folded hands. And that would have to be characterized as a dystopian robot

06:26.820 --> 06:32.100
story, the kind where the machine doesn't actually turn on its creator, but it does

06:32.100 --> 06:36.860
something that is going to be very harmful to the human race.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.760
One of the cornerstones that the robots in the novel operate on are in fact the cornerstone

06:42.280 --> 06:49.240
is they are to guard men from harm and in guarding men from harm, they deny man from

06:49.240 --> 06:54.600
any sort of creative, most intellectual, and most pleasurable pursuits that a man would

06:54.600 --> 06:54.900
have.

06:56.100 --> 07:00.080
Yeah, they won't let people drive cars, for instance, because there's a possibility of

07:00.080 --> 07:05.000
a wreck. They won't let them play certain games or sports because they could get hurt.

07:05.720 --> 07:10.100
Almost any activity that we consider to be normal is denied by the robots and they're

07:10.100 --> 07:16.080
there to enforce it so that people symbolically have to sit there with folded hands. They

07:16.080 --> 07:16.880
can't do anything.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.040
Yeah, there is no recourse against the robots.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.820
Man is created, in this case, a being that succeeds too well.

07:24.220 --> 07:27.880
So it's sort of an irony to it. Right, man has created the perfect machine, one that

07:27.880 --> 07:31.580
can do everything for him, and it does so much for him that there's a danger that man

07:31.580 --> 07:32.920
is going to become extinct almost.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.940
Also, there's an interesting group of stories, I think, that are robot cultures, or cultures

07:41.940 --> 07:46.820
of robots, or societies are formed, and they outlive humanity.

07:47.980 --> 07:52.840
Many authors who see that the human race is causing itself a great deal of trouble, say,

07:52.840 --> 07:56.560
with weapons, with nuclear warheads, with using up the environment.

07:57.420 --> 08:01.920
Will conceive of robots as outliving man, that man has created the robots, he becomes

08:01.920 --> 08:04.100
extinct and the robots take over.

08:05.080 --> 08:11.140
A few of those stories can be seen in Clifford Symax's collection, City, where man really

08:11.140 --> 08:15.740
have blasted themselves out of existence and the robots they create are there to carry

08:15.740 --> 08:16.520
on civilization.

08:17.720 --> 08:23.780
John W. Campbell has a couple stories published in the early 30s, Twilight and Night, where

08:24.360 --> 08:27.060
millions of years in the future human beings have degenerated.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.700
Their machines have become so powerful and so all-encompassing that man no longer has

08:32.700 --> 08:35.040
the capacity to be a man.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.700
It's almost an extension of Williamson's unfolded hands.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.560
And so man have degenerated into mindless beings, and the robots run the world.

08:42.540 --> 08:46.440
And one other that should be mentioned, I think, is Brian Aldous's classic story,

08:47.220 --> 08:49.200
But Who Can Replace a Man in 1958.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.820
And the interesting part of that story is that the whole thing is written from the robot's

08:53.820 --> 08:54.360
point of view.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.140
Almost all men are gone, and the robots are wondering, what do we do now?

09:00.880 --> 09:02.560
How can we carry on without them?

09:02.840 --> 09:06.100
And you see them working to form a viable society now that man is gone.

09:07.740 --> 09:13.260
This same theme is taken by other authors in a humorous tone.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.860
For instance, Siberiad by Stanislaw Lim.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.080
It's one of those inimitable works by him that's purely a good time to read.

09:22.520 --> 09:28.320
The entire piece is a social satire, the tradition of Swift, but it's in the style of science

09:28.320 --> 09:28.860
fantasy.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.460
The characters are all robots of a high degree of complexity.

09:32.460 --> 09:38.700
In fact, these are the robots that men created eons ago who have now taken their own initiative

09:38.700 --> 09:39.500
as man declined.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.920
These robots have evolved on their own into a legitimate life form and have advanced so

09:44.920 --> 09:47.520
far that they don't even remember their origin in mankind.

09:48.340 --> 09:53.160
One particularly funny passage is the recitation by one of the characters, a robot of course,

09:53.740 --> 09:59.300
of the theory of evolution a la robotics, which begins with Adam striking Adam in the

09:59.300 --> 10:04.880
formless darkness to create current, which gave rise to proto-mechanoans and so forth,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.460
not even omitting the missing clink.

10:08.460 --> 10:14.920
The digs that we pale faces as the robots refer to humans are all in good humor and the robots

10:14.920 --> 10:18.180
themselves are all original and hilariously civilized.

10:20.060 --> 10:24.640
Another robot novel in the humorous vein is Robots Have No Tales by Henry Kuttner.

10:25.800 --> 10:30.520
Gallagher, the protagonist in the book, has a rather unusual creative abilities, but only

10:30.520 --> 10:31.800
when he's completely drunk.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.300
This presents him with a myriad of problems when he sobers up because he has to figure

10:36.300 --> 10:37.540
out what he invented and why.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.360
One of his inventions in the novel Robots Have No Tales is a robot that will not respond

10:42.360 --> 10:43.280
to any of his commands.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.600
All the robot will do is sit and admire himself in a mirror.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.360
Gallagher tricks the robot into hypnotizing itself in order to greater admire its beauty,

10:51.900 --> 10:52.500
then asks it,

10:52.500 --> 10:53.740
Why did I create you?

10:53.980 --> 10:57.680
The robot reaches over and picks up a beer can and opens it without spilling a drop and

10:57.680 --> 10:58.580
hands it to Gallagher.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.240
The robot, as it turns out, is the world's most sophisticated beer can opener.

11:22.520 --> 11:27.400
But of course, whenever the subject of robots comes up, there's only one name that you need

11:27.400 --> 11:29.880
to come down to to cover the field, and that's Isaac Asimov.

11:30.660 --> 11:35.080
The name is familiar to all science fiction readers because Asimov is one of the most

11:35.080 --> 11:36.460
prolific writers of all time.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.880
He's written over 220 books and he's still going strong.

11:40.820 --> 11:45.240
He's one of the few science fiction authors who is also a scientist with a PhD in biochemistry.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.480
His first science fiction story was published in 1939 for John W. Campbell.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.840
And though he's written on almost all science fiction themes such as time travel, galactic

11:55.840 --> 12:00.800
empires, space exploration, and so forth, he is certainly best known for his robot stories.

12:01.640 --> 12:07.480
In fact, Asimov defined and molded the robot story in such books as iRobot, The Caves of

12:07.480 --> 12:10.560
Steel, The Naked Son, and the rest of the robots.

12:12.220 --> 12:18.440
As we mentioned earlier, Asimov's main purpose in dealing with robots was to create robots

12:18.440 --> 12:20.860
that were not necessarily evil.

12:21.440 --> 12:28.420
And he got around the automatic destructive qualities of robots by creating three laws

12:28.420 --> 12:32.140
that were built in to every robot that humankind created.

12:33.080 --> 12:38.060
Law number one, a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being

12:38.060 --> 12:38.920
to come to harm.

12:40.600 --> 12:45.460
Law number two, a robot must obey the orders given by human beings except where such orders

12:45.460 --> 12:46.940
will conflict with the first law.

12:47.740 --> 12:52.740
Law number three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does

12:52.740 --> 12:55.100
not conflict with the first or second law.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.440
Asimov invented what he called a positronic brain for these robots.

13:01.660 --> 13:06.340
It was made of platinum or rydium, a sponge made of those elements.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.520
And the brain paths were marked out by the production and destruction of positrons, hence

13:11.520 --> 13:12.960
the term positronic brain.

13:13.780 --> 13:20.000
And ingrained in this brain are the three laws of robotics, which a robot has to obey

13:20.000 --> 13:21.400
because it's part of his psyche.

13:22.480 --> 13:27.300
The first novel that Asimov wrote concerning the robot culture that he invented in I A

13:27.300 --> 13:30.740
Robot was the novel Caves of Steel written in 1953.

13:31.720 --> 13:37.260
Here we have a society of earthmen who have gone beyond the huge cities of today.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.080
They've taken this to the extreme.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.100
They've enclosed the cities in domes.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.580
Everyone lives within the realm of the cities.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.200
The outside lands are for farming and are run mostly by robots.

13:52.420 --> 13:58.200
The people have gotten so used to this kind of life that they can't even face the outdoors.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.660
They wouldn't know what to do with an open sky and wind in their face.

14:02.720 --> 14:08.060
These huge cities are indeed Caves of Steel and that's where the title of the novel comes

14:08.060 --> 14:08.360
from.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.900
Earth has an overpopulation problem at this time.

14:12.660 --> 14:18.340
I think the major cities on earth or all of them have about millions of people in them

14:18.340 --> 14:20.940
and on earth has eight, nine billion people on it.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.320
Their protein level is difficult to keep it up.

14:26.420 --> 14:30.940
They have to subsist on yeast and yeast becomes the basics of all their diet.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.500
And they've evolved really a very insular culture.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.140
As you said, they're afraid of the outside world.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.320
They have many fears in fact and they seem to have comfort only in their cities where

14:43.320 --> 14:46.760
they can huddle like animals in a cave or something of that sort.

14:47.860 --> 14:53.480
At one time in the past they colonized other planets but the colonists eventually overthrew

14:53.480 --> 14:56.200
them and are forcing the earth people to stay on earth.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.140
I think the earth people kind of want to stay there because by this time they're afraid

15:00.140 --> 15:03.020
too, almost of leaving their cities.

15:03.960 --> 15:09.000
They do have connections with the colonists who are now called spacers and the spacers

15:09.000 --> 15:10.880
are their trading connection with other planets.

15:11.740 --> 15:18.040
Yeah, the spacers are almost totally opposite of the remaining earthmen in that they live

15:18.040 --> 15:24.660
in open spaces, they hate the indoors, they're extremely careful about contacting the earthmen

15:24.660 --> 15:28.740
because they have eliminated almost all the diseases, earth-born diseases.

15:29.340 --> 15:35.740
And they're very fastidious and when they meet a real earthman they are extremely careful

15:35.740 --> 15:36.360
in doing so.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.980
The earthman tends to take that as an insult, being superior to the earthman.

15:42.220 --> 15:47.560
But in reality though the spacer allows that to happen because he wants to maintain an

15:47.560 --> 15:51.820
image of superiority, in reality the spacer is afraid of the earthman because the earthman

15:51.820 --> 15:53.680
can kill him with the germs that he carries.

15:54.300 --> 15:58.500
And as the book begins and we have sort of a conflict here, we have the earthman and

15:58.500 --> 16:04.560
their cities, you know, very insular and very avoiding any kind of contact with the spacers.

16:05.080 --> 16:09.080
But the spacers have one little enclave on earth to keep their contact open.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.080
And there's some sort of plot going underneath the surface.

16:12.940 --> 16:16.820
The spacers want earth to open up.

16:17.820 --> 16:22.980
They think that the only way the human race is going to progress and go forth is for the

16:22.980 --> 16:24.420
both branches to reunite.

16:25.240 --> 16:30.300
Now we don't know this at the beginning but that's the basic setup that Asimov has put

16:30.300 --> 16:30.920
into the novel.

16:31.580 --> 16:35.720
And of course into that he's injected the attitude toward robots of the respective branches

16:35.720 --> 16:36.220
of earthmen.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.460
The people on earth use robots but they use them disparagingly.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.720
They don't like robots even though they do use them.

16:43.320 --> 16:48.580
That's the old Frankenstein complex that Asimov talked about where they're afraid they're

16:48.580 --> 16:49.820
going to lose their jobs to robots.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.660
They think they're being demeaned by them.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.980
And the protagonist of the book Lige Bailey seems to hate robots.

16:57.300 --> 17:01.060
He'll curse at them, he'll try to avoid them, he'll get mad when they talk to him.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.060
And that seems to be the attitude of many earthmen.

17:03.100 --> 17:07.400
There have been riots in fact where they have trapped a robot and just torn it apart completely.

17:07.840 --> 17:14.220
The robots represent the spacers to the earthmen and they react against the robots because

17:14.220 --> 17:15.960
they can't react against the spacemen.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.340
And the spacers have got better robots.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.020
They appreciate robots, they're not afraid of them.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.020
And they've developed some very high class models.

17:25.780 --> 17:33.120
In fact the conflict of the story involves the contact and the forcing of the protagonist

17:33.120 --> 17:36.840
Lige Bailey to work with one of these extremely advanced robots.

17:37.660 --> 17:44.220
This robot is so advanced that he looks human and can be mistaken for a human by even experts

17:44.220 --> 17:44.720
in robotics.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.200
Yeah Bailey and the robot are both policemen.

17:48.980 --> 17:54.060
There's been a murder in space town that the space are on clay on earth and the spacers

17:54.060 --> 17:55.340
think it's an earthmen who's done it.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.120
And so they send their robot policemen to work with the earth policemen Lige Bailey to see

18:00.120 --> 18:04.120
if they can figure out who's done it and avoid the conflict between the spacers and the earthmen.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.120
And so the book becomes a detective story.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.340
It's one of the few science fiction detective stories that has been written.

18:11.020 --> 18:15.280
John W. Campbell one time said nobody could write a science fiction detective story.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.000
And as them off in retaliation to that wrote Kayser Steel which is a science fiction detective story.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.420
Of course others have been written since then.

18:22.940 --> 18:26.240
For instance the long arm of Gil Hamilton with Larry Nivens works.

18:27.360 --> 18:32.860
I think one interesting part about Kayser Steel is the way that Lige Bailey little by

18:32.860 --> 18:36.880
little overcomes his original hatred and fear and loathing even of this robot.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.600
This R. Daniel Oliva with the R standing for robot.

18:41.280 --> 18:46.080
In fact he's very put out at first because he doesn't know that Oliva is a robot.

18:46.660 --> 18:53.720
But as they progress as they work together Lige comes to respect him and they solve the

18:53.720 --> 18:56.600
case both of them working together when it looks like they might not.

18:56.760 --> 19:02.700
But at the last minute they do and Lige comes to understand what Asimov I think wants people

19:02.700 --> 19:05.800
to understand that robots can be beneficial and all they are is machines.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.160
That they're not to be feared.

19:08.780 --> 19:13.880
Daniel not only works with Lige Bailey but he also ends up living with him because of

19:13.880 --> 19:20.460
the restricted quarters on earth and that leads to several conflicts in Bailey's own

19:20.460 --> 19:21.320
personal life.

19:21.700 --> 19:27.480
But both Bailey and his wife eventually learn to appreciate the robot because he has many

19:27.480 --> 19:29.360
admirable qualities about him.

19:30.580 --> 19:35.660
I think we could probably say the overall theme of the book is not so much the the

19:35.660 --> 19:42.100
robot himself or the use of robots but the optimistic notion that mankind has to expand

19:42.100 --> 19:43.360
he has to keep expanding.

19:44.520 --> 19:49.980
Earth long ago before the novel started had colonized part of the solar system.

19:50.960 --> 19:56.660
They had retreated because they were then repulsed by their original colonists and now

19:56.660 --> 20:00.120
they're in solar they won't leave the earth they're afraid they're afraid even of the

20:00.120 --> 20:00.600
open air.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.440
The spacers realize that something has to be done.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.460
Earth has to open up again.

20:06.040 --> 20:10.680
And I would say the overall theme of the book therefore becomes the avoidance of stagnation

20:10.680 --> 20:16.420
the solving of overpopulation and food problems by opening up the earth and allowing earthmen

20:16.420 --> 20:19.080
to colonize again in large numbers.

20:21.020 --> 20:27.660
And Asimov carries that further in the book which followed Caves of Steel which was called

20:27.660 --> 20:28.240
the Naked Sun.

20:29.440 --> 20:34.980
In the Naked Sun Lige Bailey and Daniel are once again united on a spacer planet where

20:34.980 --> 20:38.080
a murder has taken place and they are asked to solve this murder.

20:39.180 --> 20:44.600
Here we get a first glimpse of the spacer life which is totally different from the life

20:44.600 --> 20:45.060
on earth.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.420
Here there are 20,000 people on this planet and that's all.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.840
They live each one in a house by themselves with a great amount of land surrounding them

20:53.840 --> 20:55.300
the land devoted to agriculture.

20:56.400 --> 21:01.960
And each one of these people has lived this way all his life and for generations so long

21:01.960 --> 21:08.820
that they abhor contact with each other as much as the earth people abhor insulation

21:08.820 --> 21:09.680
from others.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.800
Even when people are married and live in the same house together they live in separate

21:14.800 --> 21:15.860
wings of the house.

21:16.480 --> 21:20.760
They don't stay together they don't eat together they don't really interact together with

21:20.760 --> 21:21.780
any great degree at all.

21:22.980 --> 21:28.700
The communication and interaction that they do indulge in occurs through the use of a

21:28.700 --> 21:35.880
very sophisticated holographic setup where one room can be joined as it were to another

21:35.880 --> 21:38.880
room by means of audio-visual link.

21:39.620 --> 21:43.840
Two people would seem to be in the same room together but in actuality maybe half the planet

21:43.840 --> 21:44.240
apart.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.280
Lige has got a couple basic problems in this novel.

21:48.280 --> 21:52.300
In the first place he's still a detective he has to solve a murder another murder.

21:53.120 --> 21:58.500
Secondly he has a severe personal problem in that he's out of earth he's out of his

21:58.500 --> 22:01.200
caves of steel for the first time and the open space is terrifying.

22:01.900 --> 22:05.380
You know the first time he's not only outside of the caves of steel he's left the planet

22:05.380 --> 22:12.700
and he's got to solve his murder under this overcoming his whole training his whole upbringing

22:12.700 --> 22:14.860
which has been to avoid the outside world.

22:15.740 --> 22:23.320
And yet Lige has been one of the very few people who's begun to see the point that humans

22:23.320 --> 22:27.720
should begin to learn to get back to the open spaces and work with robots.

22:28.180 --> 22:36.080
He makes an attempt a very brave attempt for him to experience the outside and he's thinking

22:36.080 --> 22:39.000
that this is the one time that a human may get this chance.

22:40.500 --> 22:47.100
The spacers don't want to let him do that and it becomes a very strange conflict within

22:47.100 --> 22:54.280
Lige himself that he's fighting not only himself but the spacers and also that urge to find

22:54.280 --> 22:57.580
out what the open spaces and the spacer planets are really like.

22:58.040 --> 23:03.380
But I think by the end of the book we believe that not only does he solve the murder we

23:03.380 --> 23:09.080
know that but we also believe that the theme that we saw beginning in Cage of Steel is

23:09.080 --> 23:15.340
going to come about that Earth will open up, that Earth people who live in these Cages

23:15.340 --> 23:19.480
of Steel are going to realize that they can't do that forever they have to get out and we

23:20.020 --> 23:24.520
somehow suspect that the two branches of the human race the spacers and the earthmen are

23:24.520 --> 23:29.140
going to blend and they will explore and colonize further with the help of robots.

23:50.240 --> 23:57.220
Through the 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s, Asimov Robot stories for Science Fiction magazines.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.620
That's amazing over four decades he continued with the same themes, the same ideas.

24:03.120 --> 24:09.040
Mostly he'd center on an American company entitled U.S. Robotics, United States Robotics.

24:10.240 --> 24:16.280
And characters recurred in the stories particularly Susan Calvin who was a Robo-psychologist,

24:16.720 --> 24:17.920
the term invented by Asimov.

24:19.560 --> 24:25.100
And basically the stories would center on the problems, the developments, the progress

24:25.100 --> 24:30.140
and so forth involved with robots and overcoming people's fear of them.

24:31.420 --> 24:37.400
Overall I think we see that he's not only writing about robots but he's examining humanity

24:37.400 --> 24:38.500
as Amov is.

24:39.220 --> 24:43.540
As we noted earlier, a robot story in a sense reflects on human nature.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.000
It gives man something to measure himself against.

24:48.020 --> 24:54.340
And one of his latest stories and I think probably one of his most profound, Asimov works at

24:54.340 --> 24:56.900
defining what is a human being by using robots.

24:57.840 --> 25:03.960
That story is thou art mindful of him and in that story the head of U.S. Robotics has

25:04.540 --> 25:05.380
come up with a problem.

25:05.480 --> 25:10.760
His company is going into default if he cannot come up with a new product with which to sustain

25:10.760 --> 25:11.380
his company.

25:12.180 --> 25:19.280
So he takes his top flight robot George Ten and asks him how can they come up with something

25:19.280 --> 25:20.440
to sustain the company.

25:21.340 --> 25:27.100
And George Ten asks for some help from George Nine and they go into a room and start thinking.

25:28.260 --> 25:33.020
And eventually what they come up with is not what the head of U.S. Robotics is after,

25:33.300 --> 25:38.360
what they come up with is a way of getting around the three laws in that George Nine

25:38.360 --> 25:44.460
believes that George Ten is such a high caliber of being that he thinks of him as being human.

25:45.220 --> 25:50.040
And if George Ten is thought of as being human then robots are now human and can get around

25:50.040 --> 25:50.620
the three laws.

25:51.420 --> 25:56.480
Right, if it comes down to a choice of whether they should obey one of themselves, a robot

25:56.480 --> 25:58.800
or a human being, they can pick themselves.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.500
Since between themselves George Nine and Ten have worked out that they are more than human

26:04.500 --> 26:04.860
beings.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.440
So when it comes to a judgment call they can go with the robots rather than the humans.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.300
So they've gotten around the three laws.

26:12.480 --> 26:18.320
In the Fritz Lying film Metropolis in 1926 there was the first use of a humanoid type

26:18.320 --> 26:19.400
robot used in the cinema.

26:20.140 --> 26:25.560
The robot is eventually changed where its appearance is totally of that of one of the

26:25.560 --> 26:27.800
major characters in the movie, a young girl.

26:28.660 --> 26:33.340
And then the robot and the guise of the young girl is used to incite a riot on the planet

26:34.540 --> 26:37.440
which eventually leads to a partial takeover of the city.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.580
This is really a very good demonstration of the Frankenstein complex used in literature

26:42.580 --> 26:45.620
up until that time transposed to the cinema.

26:46.980 --> 26:51.660
In 1951 one of the classic science fiction films by Robert Wise is The Day the Earth

26:51.660 --> 26:52.200
Stood Still.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.320
And that movie contains one of the first identifiable robots in the cinema.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.880
These two aliens arrive on earth.

27:00.520 --> 27:06.500
One, an alien, a biological creature, and one a robot named Gort.

27:07.480 --> 27:13.860
And Gort has gone down in the cinema as one of the classic robots.

27:13.860 --> 27:18.580
And probably the first one that people could name and remember.

27:19.890 --> 27:24.340
The movie was taken from a short story called Farewell to the Master by Harry Bates.

27:25.120 --> 27:29.880
And the movie Gort is a standard robot taking instructions from the lead character, Klaatu,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
played by Michael Rennie.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.620
But in the book they have sort of a switch on that, on a theme.

27:35.420 --> 27:42.180
The robot is the master and the human alien with him is really the subject.

27:42.860 --> 27:46.860
When the human half of the alien team is killed they go to the robot and they say,

27:46.920 --> 27:48.740
well we're sorry that your master has been killed.

27:48.820 --> 27:52.240
And the robot turns to them and says, well he wasn't the master, I am the master.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.860
But these were not brought out in the film.

27:55.940 --> 28:00.680
There are some important themes in that movie, but one of them I think is a comment on humanity.

28:01.140 --> 28:07.480
The Klaatu and Gort come as peaceful creatures to contact and to establish relations.

28:08.040 --> 28:14.520
The humans start shooting and ultimately Gort responds with violently.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.360
But I'm not sure we can blame him.

28:16.420 --> 28:21.200
I think perhaps the movie maker met us to see Gort in some sympathetic light.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.060
His master has been killed, he is responding violently.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.500
But it's certainly not the Frankenstein complex operating.

28:27.480 --> 28:33.720
Once Klaatu is killed, Gort automatically goes on a destructive rampage until he is stopped

28:33.720 --> 28:37.900
with a certain set of commands which Klaatu is given to one of his friends on Earth.

28:38.780 --> 28:43.380
And then Gort goes and finds Klaatu and brings him back to the spacecraft and ultimately brings

28:43.380 --> 28:44.120
him back to life.

28:44.800 --> 28:51.440
And they give a farewell speech to the scientists gathered around the spacecraft and then depart

28:51.440 --> 28:51.980
the Earth.

28:53.440 --> 28:59.200
Another classic movie in which we can recognize a popular robot is Forbidden Planet.

29:00.360 --> 29:06.400
In 1956 when this movie was released, the audiences were exposed to a new robot known

29:06.400 --> 29:07.380
as Robbie the Robot.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.660
Most people still recognize Robbie the Robot.

29:11.880 --> 29:19.100
The actual prop they used, the robot, is still in existence and is used in all sorts of things

29:19.100 --> 29:24.060
from commercials to appearances and in shopping centers and everything else.

29:25.300 --> 29:29.980
This is one of the more popular I think of the robot characters that's been portrayed

29:29.980 --> 29:31.280
in cinema or in books.

29:31.740 --> 29:35.660
I think a lot of people when they conceive of a robot, when they get an image of one,

29:35.720 --> 29:37.440
they remember Robbie because they saw that movie.

29:38.460 --> 29:42.440
And it is one of the few movies where a robot has a major part in the motion picture.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.240
He is one of the main characters in the picture.

29:45.020 --> 29:51.340
For me Robbie is sort of a precursor or a preview of the, oh the cute person little

29:51.340 --> 29:55.360
robots that we see in later movies like Star Wars with his little beeps and clicks and so

29:55.360 --> 29:55.700
forth.

30:02.740 --> 30:05.980
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lange and David Carson.

30:07.360 --> 30:12.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science

30:12.280 --> 30:18.560
Fiction Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.000
And yet he's a hardware robot.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.620
He's nuts and bolts and light bulbs and flashing lights.

30:42.620 --> 30:49.200
Well some of the robots in Star Wars like C-3PO and R2D2.

30:53.360 --> 30:59.300
And we might touch on several other films and television shows that have included robots

30:59.300 --> 31:06.480
in a major position in, in, in cut it after robots.

31:07.620 --> 31:16.400
For instance Silent Running in 1972 Doug Trumbull's film where we see the three small robots that

31:16.400 --> 31:19.980
are in charge of the, of the forest ships.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.400
Huey Dewey and Louie.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.580
The, oh yeah.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.080
The Alien, oops.

31:33.180 --> 31:38.900
The robot that we see in the, in the 1979 movie Alien is also an interesting one.

31:39.340 --> 31:47.060
Ash who appears to be a man and all the, the people on board the ship don't realize that he's a robot

31:47.060 --> 31:53.660
until he's destroyed and comes apart and they can see the, the mechanism is an interesting one also.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.520
Bob and the cable.

32:00.760 --> 32:05.080
And I guess we should also mention Black Hole.

32:05.880 --> 32:13.580
This is an example I think of, of the poor taste in, in the presentation of robots.

32:14.140 --> 32:20.880
This is like we've said in concerning with, like we've said in reference to aliens.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.840
Here you, they've just given us a human in a funny suit.

32:24.260 --> 32:27.000
These are not really robots and not portrayed realistically.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.360
They're, they're just funny creatures in, in funny suits.

32:30.660 --> 32:35.480
I think they tried to build on Star Wars there with, with cute little robots and they just overdid the cuteness.

32:37.320 --> 32:43.240
A movie, very recent movie entitled Saturn III which otherwise wasn't too impressive to me at least,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.860
had a fairly interesting robot in the name Hector, which is what I think a robot would look like.

32:48.860 --> 32:54.700
It was the creature himself at least was well done even though the movie I don't think was a very successful one.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.700
We haven't really talked about Star Wars.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.760
We mentioned it earlier. That's everybody knows about Star Wars.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.780
Yeah, no, no. Okay.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.560
Television has also had its,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
television has also,

33:11.340 --> 33:14.160
television has also had its host of robots.

33:15.320 --> 33:20.020
The, one of the, one of the main characters in Lost in Space was a robot.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.400
Lost in Space produced in the late 60s.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.220
We aren't really given any background on, on the robot.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.680
We don't even know what its name is.

33:27.760 --> 33:33.080
It's only referred to as a robot in the British BBC series, Doctor Who.

33:33.340 --> 33:36.580
Doctor Who's, one of Doctor Who's main nemesis,

33:37.400 --> 33:39.540
Husser Plurals nemesis is nemesis.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.440
And the BBC,

33:42.680 --> 33:44.680
and the BBC,

33:47.620 --> 33:53.400
and the BBC series, Doctor Who, one of Doctor Who's main nemesis,

33:53.680 --> 33:55.860
sis, I forgot it, nemesis.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.960
And the BBC series, Doctor Who, one of Doctor Who's,

34:01.080 --> 34:04.660
one of Doctor Who's main nemesis are the Daleks,

34:04.700 --> 34:07.120
which are a alien robot race,

34:07.120 --> 34:11.580
which in various unsundry times through the series tries to come and take over the Earth.

34:12.660 --> 34:17.900
And one of the latest versions of robots are the Cylons used in Battlestar Galactica.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.780
And there they're the ultimate enemies of mankind,

34:22.100 --> 34:24.260
pure hostility out to exterminate the human race.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.620
Segway, segway, segway, ending.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.000
Another famous ending by D. Cruz.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.040
Short and sweet.

34:39.060 --> 34:44.400
Whether the robots of reality will correspond with those of fiction remains to be seen.

34:45.260 --> 34:50.800
But science fiction authors will, we hope, continue to tantalize us with stories of the mechanical men,

34:51.500 --> 34:53.640
the iron and steel and plastic men,

34:54.120 --> 34:59.900
who are really a reflection of ourselves as man attempts to create life in his own image.

35:01.780 --> 35:03.460
Okay, let's rewind it, let's go home.
