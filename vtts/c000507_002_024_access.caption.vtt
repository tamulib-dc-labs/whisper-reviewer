00:01.300 --> 00:11.340
Thank you, sir. Right. Okay, maybe just a brief statement. Have you always been
a full-time writer? Yeah.

00:14.780 --> 00:21.180
I went effectively out of... I should start at the beginning. I've never been
anything but a writer, actually.

00:24.180 --> 00:35.160
I entered the University of Minnesota in 1939 when I was 15 years old, and began
work toward a degree for creative writing. I was a major in creative writing.

00:37.480 --> 00:50.220
World War II came along before I was able to get my B.A. So I was out for three
years, four years, I forget which, something like that. Then I went back and

00:50.220 --> 00:58.060
spent another two years, went into graduate school. At the time, it's about the
only time in my life when I ever considered doing anything but writing. I was

00:58.060 --> 01:12.060
playing with the idea then of holding down a teaching job, going on and getting
my doctorate in English and teaching, and doing the writing on the side. After

01:12.060 --> 01:23.920
World War II, we were all hypersensible. Everybody was very cool-headed. Let's
have this nonsense over with. Get down and get to work someplace. Luckily, I

01:23.920 --> 01:30.400
came out of that and said, this is silly. I'd never intended to do anything but
writing. Instead of having the teaching pay for the writing, why not make the

01:30.400 --> 01:39.960
writing pay for the writing? I simply dived out of graduate school into full
-time writing for the magazines. There were still quite a few magazines around.

01:40.780 --> 01:50.580
There were still a fair number of pulp magazines, for example. Now, the slick
magazines paid a great deal more, but they were chancy.

01:51.780 --> 02:00.420
The slick magazines, what they wanted from week to week would depend on what the
theme of that particular issue was. In other words, they might like you and they

02:00.420 --> 02:09.400
might like what you write and so on and so forth, but if you'd written a story
about blowworms and they wanted one, you know, a fiction story that involved

02:09.400 --> 02:18.020
blowworms, and they wanted one about cowboys on the western plains, then they
didn't want that particular story. And there would be no place else to send it.

02:18.580 --> 02:25.280
The pulp magazines, on the other hand, if you wrote a science fiction story,
there were a number of science fiction magazines, or a number of detective, or a

02:25.280 --> 02:39.300
number of western. So actually, I dived in and kept myself in float writing for
the magazines for about three or four years, and then I, somewhere about 1954, I

02:39.300 --> 02:50.740
did my first science fiction novel. So I've been full-time as a writer since
1950. Now, I'd sold things before then. I'd sold a magazine piece, I think as

02:50.740 --> 03:02.300
early as 1942, and I had something in my magazine, a short, short story in a
magazine section of a Minneapolis paper, and I'd been in the Toronto Star

03:02.300 --> 03:15.580
Weekly, which was a magazine supplement that went along with the Toronto Star
Journal. Star Journal? Ah, can't remember the name of the newspaper. See, you

03:15.580 --> 03:24.680
see, the thing is that I always intended to be a writer, and about for the first
30 years of my life, I was simply looking for the type of thing I wanted to

03:24.680 --> 03:34.880
write. I cut my teeth on poetry. If I'd been born in the late 19th century, I
would have been at home because I would have done long narrative poems like

03:34.880 --> 03:47.340
Idylls of the King, you know, Tennyson's, and Hiawatha, and things like this. As
it is, we're in a non-poetic age, and I finally ended up saying, well, to do

03:47.340 --> 03:56.000
what I want to do, I'm going to have to use the medium of historical novels. And
then simply because magazines were putting bread and butter on the table and I

03:56.000 --> 04:06.580
found out I liked science fiction best, I liked writing science fiction best, I
ended up doing essentially nothing but science fiction. And as I did this, I

04:06.580 --> 04:16.080
came to realize the possibilities in that particular field for what I wanted to
do. And of course what I wanted to do has now taken shape long since 20 years

04:16.080 --> 04:27.100
ago as the childe cycle of novels, which is, when it's done, will cover a
thousand years. There'll be three historical novels, starting with one about Sir

04:27.100 --> 04:43.540
John Hawkwood, who was an Englishman in the 13th century who ended up as Captain
General of the military forces for Florence, Italy. And will end in the 23rd

04:43.540 --> 04:58.900
century with Childe, C-H-I-L-D-E, the novel from which the whole series takes its
name. And the whole series, effectively, the stories don't chronologically

04:58.900 --> 05:09.040
follow each other. They're connected thematically. And what they represent is
sort of a literary thematic argument, something that has never been done before,

05:09.040 --> 05:20.880
actually. Which argues, it's a philosophical point, in fact, it argues that
we're undergoing evolution right now. It's not physical evolution or mental

05:20.880 --> 05:27.940
evolution. It's a, there's no really good word for it. You would call it
spiritual evolution, but that isn't right either. It's an ethical evolution.

05:28.340 --> 05:38.480
We're, of necessity, we're evolving what I call a responsible human being, and
we're sort of halfway there. From the time of the third, look at, from the

05:38.480 --> 05:49.660
viewpoint of the 13th century, toward the 23rd, we're halfway to developing the
responsible human being. if you assume that, oh,

05:52.820 --> 06:02.080
insanity is going to be brought under control unless civilization goes crash
within the next 50 or 100 years, if not a lot sooner, that is going to give you

06:02.080 --> 06:11.720
a population of sane people. But even a population of sane people can have
individuals who, for their own purposes, are willing to destroy things. Now,

06:12.080 --> 06:26.140
back in the days of of the flint axe and the stone club, if a particular caveman
decided to run wild and start bopping people over the head, he could probably

06:26.140 --> 06:36.340
kill two or three others before everybody ganged up on him and stopped him. And
that's escalated up a lot of times where somebody who knows how can set up a

06:36.340 --> 06:50.480
laboratory in the basement and blow up a large-sized city or part of a state.
And you extrapolate the curve of destructive possibility and you see that

06:51.620 --> 07:03.840
within, well, probably less than the three to five hundred years I give us,
you're going to have a situation where any individual can destroy the whole race

07:03.840 --> 07:15.120
unless some such sense of responsibility is developed. And what the historical
novels do and the contemporary novels do is what a good hard science fiction

07:15.120 --> 07:23.320
story does, and that is they lay out the evidence of what we know and then
extrapolate forward from there saying, all right, if this and this and this is

07:23.320 --> 07:37.280
so and we know it to be so, then doesn't this develop from it? You know, and if
I'm wrong in my hypothesis, point out where I'm wrong. And so the whole cycle

07:37.280 --> 07:50.760
becomes essentially sort of one large science fiction story, even though it
covers historical, contemporary, and future novels. Okay, excellent. You've

07:50.760 --> 08:00.520
answered about five or six of my questions there. I get it. I get it in the
habit of doing this. See, I'm a part-time lecturer and platform speaker and I

08:00.520 --> 08:09.480
get off on this topic and I tend to run with it. Well, listen, I take it from
what you said and from what I understand from your work that essentially you're

08:09.480 --> 08:18.520
an optimist about man's future. Oh, yes. Yes. And the evidence is there for
optimism. In fact, if you look at things historically, you'll find that

08:18.520 --> 08:29.440
pessimism has always been the short-term view and optimism has been the long
-term view. What survives in the way of philosophy and literature and history

08:29.440 --> 08:43.080
and so on and so forth shows a general overall improvement and development of
society. At any given moment you look around yourself and you say, my God, I

08:43.080 --> 08:55.700
don't see how we can last out a year. You know, five years at the outside. But
they've been saying that since Egyptian days. you know, these old jokes about

08:55.700 --> 09:11.520
the archaeologists looking at the writing inside the pyramid and saying, you
know, there is no hope. Well, the human race is simply going downhill. The

09:11.520 --> 09:19.800
present generation doesn't know anything and the old generation has given up and
we've got problems that are too big for us to handle so what hope is there for

09:19.800 --> 09:32.560
us? It has always looked that way from the static point in history. That
attitude is going to have to change, though, because beginning with the 1960s

09:32.560 --> 09:45.520
particularly, but even before then, unconsciously, this change was coming about.
We're developing a generation and we have a generation right now that realizes

09:45.520 --> 09:54.460
they stand on a moving sidewalk. You can see history. You can see the world
changing around you as you stand because of technological advances. In other

09:54.460 --> 10:09.260
words, 100 to 150 years ago, if you were gifted with intelligence and ambition
and a certain amount of luck and possibilities, you could say, when I grow up,

10:09.280 --> 10:19.000
I'm going to work hard and get rich and I'm going to have a White House on a
hill with a coach and six fine horses. And if you could point to the hill and,

10:19.160 --> 10:31.320
my gosh, 40 years later, if you had done what you set out to do, you could be on
that hill with that house and those horses. Nowadays, you say, 40 years from

10:31.320 --> 10:41.620
now, I'd like to have such and so. And if it's an equivalent of a house on a
hill and so on and so forth, by the time you get there, they may not have

10:41.620 --> 10:52.600
houses, let alone White Houses and they won't be using horses or whatever our
present form of transportation is, and the hill may have been bulldozed flat for

10:52.600 --> 11:03.620
that matter. In other words, living is becoming a situation in which intelligent
people will have to keep learning all their lives simply to keep up and keep

11:03.620 --> 11:15.260
adjusting. Now, this implies unnecessary flexibility that was not in existence
before. History changed things, but it changed things so slowly that people

11:15.260 --> 11:27.420
could pretend that in their own lifetime there was no change. Okay, very good.
To be a little more specific about your childe cycle, I think, if I recall, it

11:27.420 --> 11:38.040
was in 1959 Astounding that the Dorsai series started. How much of your future
history had you conceived at that time? Which, what date was that? I think it

11:38.040 --> 11:51.680
was in 1959 Astounding the Dorsai story that Genetic General was published. Oh,
yes, well actually the Astounding did it under its proper title which was Dorsai.

11:52.660 --> 12:02.480
It was Ace Books at that time that changed it to that crazy title of Genetic
General which has since been buried. you know, we're back to calling it Dorsai

12:02.480 --> 12:12.960
again. It came out in the magazine as a serial under the title Dorsai. Actually,
that was written in 1958

12:14.620 --> 12:31.820
and the cycle as it's in a printout form if you want to describe it that way
wasn't in existence at that time. What had happened was that from the time when

12:31.820 --> 12:44.240
I was very young I decided to as one of these kids that taught myself to read
when I was about four years old I did it by the well-known method of being read

12:44.240 --> 12:51.560
to a lot and as a child and as a child you memorized the stories you read to and
I would pick up a book and pretend to read it and pretty soon I began to connect

12:51.560 --> 13:03.020
what I was saying with what was on the paper and I was fascinated with stories.
I said, this is what I want to do and from then on I was looking for what

13:03.020 --> 13:15.020
specifically I wanted to do with this and as I grew up and the ideas developed
it came that I wanted to do a large work that had a particular application to

13:15.020 --> 13:29.860
literature and to my times. In other words I had the rough pattern of what I was
after but it hadn't coalesced it was misty around the edges. Back in 1948 after

13:29.860 --> 13:41.800
World War II when I was in graduate school I was working on a historical novel
called The Pikeman which was about 15th century Italy as Hoffwood is 14th

13:41.800 --> 13:54.420
century actually. And it's about a young member of one of the levies of Swiss
pikemen who comes down into Italy and sees the civilization down there and looks

13:54.420 --> 14:07.040
at it through this clean pair of northern amoral mountain eyes essentially
because this is the explosive beginning of the Renaissance you see.

14:10.060 --> 14:19.280
Now when I after I'd done Dorsai later on see when I started to make a living
writing short stories I didn't have time to sit down and write a novel. You have

14:19.280 --> 14:28.860
to take six months at least out to do a decent job. And how you keep the wolf
from the door during those six months if you're living hand to mouth from short

14:28.860 --> 14:29.980
story income is

14:32.800 --> 14:43.980
the question. And so I simply didn't get around to writing a novel until I had
the money to do so. When I did I wrote it under a good deal of pressure in

14:43.980 --> 14:56.880
pretty much of a hurry and I came up with Dorsai and this first novel and after
I'd done it the following summer I was at the Milford Science Fiction

14:56.880 --> 15:07.420
Conference. Now this was a my invitation only conference for those of us who
were professional science fiction writers. It was held every June

15:08.500 --> 15:18.980
up in the Catskills and I used to go in spite of the fact that the various
pollens up there at that time would trigger off my asthma and I wouldn't sleep

15:18.980 --> 15:19.600
for a week.

15:22.660 --> 15:33.160
I began to be afflicted by asthma during World War II and it would have been a
miserable time if it hadn't been such a magnificent time because it was our

15:33.160 --> 15:43.820
chance to sit around and talk shop. The afternoons we would read each other's
manuscripts and criticize them in the evenings we'd sit around and debate some

15:43.820 --> 15:54.120
particular writerly topic or something. But mostly it was simply knocking heads
with your fellow wizards that made it worthwhile. And while I was up there I hit

15:54.120 --> 16:06.240
one night, one asthmatic night when I was exhausted and I thought well maybe
I'll sleep through and asthmatics tell them this. Of course you don't. I woke up

16:06.240 --> 16:16.080
an hour later solid. Now people who don't know asthma don't realize that it
isn't a matter of getting breath in, it's a matter of getting breath out. You

16:16.080 --> 16:27.700
swell up with air that you can't exhale. And your adrenaline level goes off the
top of the map. You're physically incapacitated and the mind just gallops. Now

16:27.700 --> 16:35.900
we're way off in the woods effectively and there was nothing to be done until
dawn, at which time other people would be up and they could drive me to the

16:35.900 --> 16:47.160
nearest doctor or clinic or what have you. And so I just, I had nothing to do
but sit there for five hours and wait for the sun to rise. And in that time I

16:47.160 --> 17:00.940
worked out the pattern for this cycle completely. From soup to nuts with every
book in its place or rather every, I shouldn't say every book because the

17:00.940 --> 17:09.260
numbers of books have doubled because of the size of what's being done. But it's
a case of the original books more or less being split down the middle. You see?

17:09.760 --> 17:23.440
Because they're too big to publish as a chunk. The whole thing laid itself out.
And when dawn did rise, or the sun came up, I mean, I went and talked over with

17:23.440 --> 17:37.340
one of our fellow visitors who was a man named Richard McKenna who wrote a novel
called The Sand Pebble, which, from which a movie was made that older people may

17:37.340 --> 17:50.820
remember a little bit. The Sand Pebbles was not a science fiction movie. McKenna
had been in the Navy all his life, and it was about China, actually, at the time

17:50.820 --> 18:02.200
of the Boxer. But it had been a very big, thick novel as the cycle was a very
large, massive thing. time. And so he had some reference. We sat there and

18:02.200 --> 18:18.860
kicked it around. Essentially, what he did for me, he was like throwing a ball
against a wall. In the process of trying to explain it to him, I put my thoughts

18:18.860 --> 18:31.320
into words. And curiously enough, what was worked out in that one night has
never really been changed. About ten years later, toward the end of the 60s, I

18:31.320 --> 18:41.980
ran across a situation where I thought, well, I'll change it around. And I tried
it, and by golly, it wouldn't change. It was too interlocked with actual history

18:41.980 --> 19:00.100
and patterns of development that I had had working from 20 years before I got
the definitive cycle plan itself. Okay, in other words, what you've done then is

19:00.100 --> 19:10.320
to look back into history and extrapolate from what has happened to what is
happening now to what will happen in the future. That's right, yes. And saying

19:10.320 --> 19:22.280
that as I see it, we are traveling this direction. And this is my evidence, and
see if you can find any evidence to disprove

19:22.280 --> 19:33.720
what I project. This is, this attitude, this is what I took from science
fiction. This is what I found in science fiction that was so useful. And it was

19:33.720 --> 19:45.980
the core of the magazine that John Campbell published in Astounding, which later
became Analog, the hard science fiction story that says this is a legitimate

19:45.980 --> 19:46.680
hypothesis.

19:49.040 --> 19:59.440
attack it if you can. Okay, I think a lot of people who don't know all of your
work would mostly associate you with the Dorsai novel, and I've read that some

19:59.440 --> 20:10.860
people consider you to be a militarist because of that. I don't think that's
fair to you. Well, actually, it isn't really. The cycle is made with three

20:10.860 --> 20:17.540
archetypes, three human archetypes, one of which is the warrior, one of which is
the philosopher, and one of which is the faith holder.

20:23.780 --> 20:33.760
each book showcases one of these types. For example, Sir John Hawkwood is
obviously a warrior. The second historical novel deals with John Milton, not as

20:33.760 --> 20:43.140
a poet, but as a propagandist essentially for the Promellian government during
the period when he was writing his tracks for the cause. So we have a faith

20:43.140 --> 20:54.160
holder here, and the faith holder, he's ideal for my need as a faith holder
archetype because he shows the two faces of the faith holder. The faith holder

20:54.160 --> 21:04.720
is actually genus face. You know the old Roman god at the entrance of the Roman
houses that looked both in and out had two faces. The two faces of the faith

21:04.720 --> 21:17.300
holder is the fanatic and the true faith holder. The word saint doesn't quite
cover it. It's somebody who is utterly committed to the faith they believe in,

21:17.360 --> 21:30.560
as opposed to the fanatic who essentially uses the faith for their own purpose.
Now, the historical novels show the warrior, the faith holder, and the

21:30.560 --> 21:31.040
philosopher

21:33.580 --> 21:45.740
in the person of people we can look up in history books. The 20th century will
show them that work in our century. The future ones show them in the projected

21:45.740 --> 21:56.260
and problematical future. But the warrior is only one of three types, all of
which equally necessary. The philosopher and the faith holder. For example, the

21:56.260 --> 22:08.160
book that's now in my publisher's hands, that's 1,400 manuscript pages long, and
will be coming out in about a year now, within the next year hopefully, will be

22:08.160 --> 22:09.660
a great big book, is really

22:12.820 --> 22:26.760
part of the closing scene of the whole doggone panorama that the cycle
represents. So its hero is all things, both warrior, faith holder, and

22:26.760 --> 22:27.300
philosopher.

22:31.860 --> 22:44.880
but it has, in this particular book, because there's two more to come after
this, these will be consecutive, these will be prequel, sequel, post-sequel,

22:45.940 --> 22:55.400
final encyclopedia, then Chantry Guild, and then Child, will really be three
parts of one, there'll be a trilogy, effectively. The story will be continuous,

22:55.480 --> 23:07.360
in other words, but this first one, the final encyclopedia, deals mainly with
the attitude of the faith holder. This is essentially what my multi-hero, who is

23:07.360 --> 23:12.360
really a reincarnation, although reincarnation is not the proper word, it's the
second,

23:17.160 --> 23:29.800
really the third life, I should say, of the man who was the hero of Dorsai,
Donal Graeme. Dorsai, he was Donal Graeme, effectively reanimated, went back in

23:29.800 --> 23:41.740
time and animated the dead body because he can't change the past, to exist as
Paul Formain in Necromancer, and now he goes forward and becomes Tam, pardon me,

23:41.800 --> 23:57.500
not Tam, but Hal Mayne in the last three books. And in the final encyclopedia,
Hal Mayne essentially becomes fully developed in his faith holder part. Now the

23:57.500 --> 24:12.580
reason the emphasis on the military is there is for two reasons. One is this
caught the eye of the publishers, and they packaged the books as military

24:12.580 --> 24:24.740
oriented books. And in fact, the ones that dealt with warrior types like Donal
Graeme, the first one door sign, where Donal Graeme is a warrior archetype, were

24:24.740 --> 24:34.200
it was legitimate to it that way, but then they began publishing all the things
this way. See? That is part of it. The other part of it is that since all the

24:34.200 --> 24:46.480
cycle must be sound, must be watertight, is that the military elements in there
are justified, are logicalized. You see? So it's not, I don't blame people for

24:46.480 --> 24:58.320
being led astray in this particular fashion. But if they will look closely at
the cycle, they will see it isn't true. And about the only people I have any

24:58.320 --> 25:11.960
quarrel with are those who, without reading things, simply make the assumption
that this is a militaristically oriented series of books. Okay, I just have

25:11.960 --> 25:20.680
about two or three more. Can you handle that? Oh, sure. Okay, listen, um, okay,
uh, Donal Graeme, uh... I'll tell you what, uh, would you give, could you cut it

25:20.680 --> 25:27.520
for just a second here? I'm going to have to get something. Yeah. My, my voice
tends to give out on me. Yeah, no trouble, no trouble. Great.

25:31.840 --> 25:44.480
What was the, uh, where were we? Okay, I was just going to ask about, um, Donal
Green, uh, now he's got a vision or intuition. He's, uh, the future of man and

25:44.480 --> 25:53.900
so forth. Why would you have that vision come from a dorsi, a warrior, say,
rather than an exotic? Well, he doesn't have a vision. Uh, what, what he has is,

25:54.120 --> 26:08.240
uh, what he has is intuitive logic. And, uh, in other words, instead of, uh, it
bears the same relation to, uh, uh, ordinary logical process that, say,

26:08.380 --> 26:19.480
calculus, please, uh, you know, has to arisbatech. Uh, this is merely a tool.
Now, I'm going to be substantiating this tool, uh, in the historical and

26:19.480 --> 26:35.580
contemporary things. Uh, there's, uh, uh, this type of, of thinking is, uh, is
in its embryo form right now. You know, there is evidence of it just as, um, I

26:35.580 --> 26:43.780
don't know, have, have you read, uh, Soldier Aspenut? Yes, I have. All right.
Well, you remember there's a artifact in there called the final encyclopedia.

26:44.920 --> 27:01.820
And the final encyclopedia is, is not something, uh, is, is substantiated by
something, uh, called the theater of memory that was, uh, developed in the, uh,

27:01.960 --> 27:12.000
early part of the Renaissance. About, well, early to mid part of the
Renaissance, actually. And again, the aim was, was to get all knowledge together

27:12.000 --> 27:23.440
in a single handleable form, which is something that in the 20th century we're
approaching, uh, through computer science. See? All these things hook together.

27:23.620 --> 27:35.020
They're, uh, the pattern of thought, the trick of thinking that is intuitive
logic, if I call intuitive logic, and that Donal uses in, uh,

27:38.080 --> 27:49.880
uh, in Dorsai, and which will surface again, actually, in the later books. It,
it, it reappears, for example, in, uh, in the final encyclopedia and will, will

27:49.880 --> 27:59.960
become one of the tools that give access to the creative universe, which is what
the whole cycle aims at all along. Because one of the arguments of the cycle,

28:00.040 --> 28:08.800
cycle makes various arguments. As I said, it's, it's main one is that we are in
process of evolution, even though we don't know it right now. Uh, we're partway

28:08.800 --> 28:23.580
toward the development of the responsible human being, particularly in Western
culture. Uh, but one of the other arguments is that we are, uh, let's see, what

28:23.580 --> 28:37.520
were we, we were off on theater of memory, intuition, logic. Uh, we are
beginning to develop now the uses of our own mind and body that were more or

28:37.520 --> 28:49.980
less dreamed of, uh, only at earlier times. Just as, for example, modern
technology was a dream of primitive man. Again, the flint worker. The flint

28:49.980 --> 29:03.700
worker dreamed of being able to, uh, turn the rain off. Well, never found out
how to turn the rain off or turn the rain on, uh, until now. Now we can turn

29:03.700 --> 29:13.340
rain on. We, we haven't yet hit the point where we can turn it off, but that's
right over the blank horizon. Uh, what they came up with instead was, were

29:13.340 --> 29:23.320
shelters. Then they wanted a shelter that wasn't smoky. And by golly, somebody
invented the chimney. They wanted a house that would be warm in the winter and

29:23.320 --> 29:36.340
they developed insulation and, uh, eventually furnaces. They dreamed of being
cool in the summer. And by golly, along came air conditioning and things like

29:36.340 --> 29:50.280
this. The dreams of any people at any particular time in history become the
realities of future generation. Now, how far down the line, you don't know at

29:50.280 --> 30:01.240
all, but essentially so far with the human race, just about anything that can be
dreamed of has been gained. Essentially. About the only thing, there's, uh,

30:01.320 --> 30:08.780
there's a tendency to respond to when I say this sort of thing with platform
people. Well, during the question and answer period, they'll hold up their,

30:08.960 --> 30:18.480
their hands and say, but, uh, how about the dream of universal peace? And I say,
well, now you're not dealing, you can deal with universe, you can cheat

30:18.480 --> 30:28.140
universal peace very well with yourself. See? When you're trying to achieve it
with somebody else, now that's another kettle of fish entirely. See? You have

30:28.140 --> 30:38.700
counter purposes going back and forth. But things that can be done, man against
his own universe, man against his own environment, uh, is a battle that so far

30:38.700 --> 30:49.060
we tend to win. And we're also beginning to win, uh, again in this last thousand
years, and this is one of the things we're partway toward developing now, the

30:49.060 --> 31:00.380
battle of man against himself. In other words, we're beginning to say to
ourselves, I don't want to be fat. You know? I don't want to be unhappy. I don't

31:00.380 --> 31:14.980
want to be, uh, depressed. And we're beginning to fumble out ways of doing
something about fat and, uh, depression and so on and so forth. Just as we're

31:14.980 --> 31:25.160
beginning to fumble toward an answer to, uh, the question of, of universal
hunger. You know? The fact that some people are always going to lack this or

31:25.160 --> 31:25.680
lack that.

31:28.620 --> 31:39.700
Okay, that's good. Um, okay, I can, I just have about two more. Now, um, I know,
I know you work very hard at this, but as long as you've written now, how hard

31:39.700 --> 31:52.300
is it for you to write? Do you have to put a lot of work into it? Oh, the
writing, any kind, any, any art requires an infinite amount of work. And what

31:52.300 --> 32:04.160
was it said that, uh, uh, the definition of art was, was the taking of infinite
pains or words to that effect. Uh, but the point is, uh, the person doing it

32:04.160 --> 32:19.980
enjoys it or he doesn't do it. Uh, I'm, I'm fascinated with the work I do. Uh,
I, you wonder, for example, how a concert pianist can practice five hours a day,

32:20.960 --> 32:31.400
you know, week after week, month after month, year after year. You think, uh, if
you were not, if you're a non-piano player, or if you had piano playing lessons

32:31.400 --> 32:40.420
pushed on you and didn't like them when you were young, you think that this must
be, uh, this must be a self-imposed agony. It isn't. It, it, it's a sheer

32:40.420 --> 32:51.540
pleasure for him to, to get things just right. And this, of course, is the
battle cry of the artist, to get things just right. Uh, I, I write and rewrite

32:51.540 --> 33:07.120
and rewrite and rewrite again. This last book, uh, sections of it, uh, were
written once and barely touched again. Other sections were written in numberable

33:07.120 --> 33:19.040
times. I really couldn't tell you how many, 10 or more, 10, 15 times to get it
just right. Uh, I can't reread anything I've written without picking up a pencil

33:19.040 --> 33:28.200
and starting to, to correct and improve it. It's instinctive. Most writers have
this kind of reaction to a certain extent, although some rewrite more, some

33:28.200 --> 33:38.300
rewrite less. There is a type of writer that, uh, that doesn't rewrite, but
instead sits and does nothing for a long time and then sits down and does it

33:38.300 --> 33:48.660
just the way he or she wants it. And that possibly is the hardest work of all
because it's all being done in the end. I do it on paper. Of course, uh, the

33:48.660 --> 33:55.700
fact that I use, uh, I use a computer to write with nowadays makes it that much
easier, makes it that much faster.

33:58.660 --> 34:05.960
Okay, uh, finally, I want to make sure I have this straight now because I've
read some differing, some differing statements from critics on your childe cycle.

34:06.620 --> 34:20.340
Okay, when it's finished, there will be 12 novels. Is that right? Uh, let's see
now. Yes, the, um, original plan was for six novels. Um,

34:25.180 --> 34:37.720
uh, let me see. No, for nine novels. Pardon me. Um, three historical, three late
in the 20th century, and three late in the future. Uh, because I started on the

34:37.720 --> 34:49.040
future length first, it was there I first discovered that these, that each book
was, was going to be too big to get into one, uh, one set of covers. Also, to

34:49.040 --> 34:57.920
begin with, with Dorsai and, uh, Soldier Astronaut and Necromancer and things
like that, I was up against the fact that publishers, uh, refused to print

34:57.920 --> 35:13.340
category fiction in lengths of much more than 100,000 words at that time. 

35:04.500 --> 35:10.560
Remember this the first big book to come out actually was Frank Herbert's Dune which

35:10.560 --> 35:18.520
antedates Dorsai which happened earlier about I think four or six years something

35:18.520 --> 35:29.300
like that and Dune was printed only because one editor in particular practically well

35:29.300 --> 35:34.840
lay his job on the line and practically offered to shoot their, shoot up the publishing house unless they

35:35.000 --> 35:45.200
went after it. And they chewed their fingernails, you know, because there's,
there's a great deal of, of money involved in printing a very large book. Uh,

35:45.340 --> 35:54.900
this is still the case, even with paperbacks, even in paperback, it's very
expensive to do a big, thick book. So these things had to be cut, uh, pardon me,

35:55.060 --> 36:06.120
I mean, they had to be divided into smaller chunks. And the result was I ended
up with three historical, three contemporary, and, uh, six forward. Now, of that

36:06.120 --> 36:20.020
six forward, uh, final encyclopedia, uh, at 1400 pages is so big that childe,
which should have been, see that final encyclopedia is the penultimate novel.

36:20.940 --> 36:31.540
The last one, the ultimate one is childe. And obviously if final encyclopedia is
1400, childe would have run close to 2000 manuscript pages, which is far too big.

36:31.680 --> 36:44.740
So I've had to split that again. So effectively what we have now is, uh, not 12,
but 13 novels. Now, I would like to say that this won't happen anymore, that

36:44.740 --> 36:53.780
the, uh, three, once I get through childe, the three historical and the three
contemporary will, will stay within single volume sizes. I think there's a

36:53.780 --> 37:03.340
pretty good chance, except in the case of Hawkwood. Now, and the problem with
that is, is that Sir John Hawkwood, the real, the actual man, uh, lived a very

37:03.340 --> 37:12.720
long time by medieval standards. It's an astonishingly long time when you just,
uh, stopped to think that most of his adult life was spent, uh, in hand-to-hand

37:12.720 --> 37:26.540
combat wearing armor. Uh, he, he actually lived into his seventies and he
covered in that time what by modern standards would have been three or four

37:26.540 --> 37:38.760
lifetimes. He starts out in Sible Heddingham, England, which is out in the
boondocks of Essex in his time, literally when Essex was mainly forest and, uh,

37:38.900 --> 37:50.460
ends up in Florence, Italy, which at that time was the center of Western
civilization. So effectively he traveled in subjective time about 150 to 180

37:50.460 --> 37:58.940
years in terms of, of moving forward with the pattern of civilization. Excuse
me, time out.

38:03.820 --> 38:08.060
Yeah, I'm back with you. Sure.

38:11.780 --> 38:20.380
Okay. What else have you got for me? Well, okay. I guess I do have one more.
That was about it. But let me ask you one more. Uh, this is something we like to

38:20.380 --> 38:28.660
ask most authors who've been written, who've written as long as you have. Um, as
you look around the field now, is it essentially different than it was when you

38:28.660 --> 38:41.160
started writing? Oh, yes. You know, it's, it's a great deal different. Uh, but
the difference is, uh, one of natural, natural evolution and development. Uh, in

38:41.160 --> 38:53.720
other words, it's, it's not that, you see, there was no point at which science
fiction stood still. The, if you look at the magazines of the late 1920s, which

38:53.720 --> 39:04.480
is when Hugo Gernsback was, uh, essentially starting the field in its modern
sense, you can trace science fiction, if you, if you like, back to the Athenian

39:04.480 --> 39:20.060
Greeks, uh, in, in the sense of stories about other worlds and other places. Uh,
Atlantis, the concept of Atlantis goes back that far, for example. Uh, Cyrano de

39:20.060 --> 39:32.840
Bergerac, and I'm talking about the actual man, not the, uh, character in the
play, uh, wrote a, uh, several stories. One of them is called Voyages to the Sun

39:32.840 --> 39:33.320
and the Moon.

39:36.920 --> 39:47.300
Uh, there, there was a, in other words, it, it, it, it, it's a story type that
runs, runs down through history, although it's rare. It, it became a school,

39:47.500 --> 39:58.020
essentially, a category in, in publisher's terms in the 1920s when magazines
began to devote themselves. This was the heyday of the magazines, and there were

39:58.020 --> 40:09.560
racing magazines and Western magazines, and there were science fiction
magazines, magazines of fantastic science. That's right. And, um, it, what was

40:09.560 --> 40:21.880
printed in the, uh, late 1920s and the early 1930s, uh, went through a period of
development when John Gamble took over Astounding, and it, and the concept of

40:21.880 --> 40:33.980
the hard science fiction story, and also something else, the idea story, which
is essentially a thematic science fiction story, uh, began with, with John in

40:33.980 --> 40:45.980
the 30s. And that period has developed and gone on. They, they were originally
hardware stories, originally science fiction. That's, as, uh, it's gone from

40:45.980 --> 40:57.880
hard science to essentially soft science. In other words, uh, the, the subject,
the scientific element has, has gone from physics and chemistry to, uh, or

40:57.880 --> 41:10.340
rather went from physics and chemistry into, uh, psychology and sociology and
things like this. And, uh, with the emergence in the 60s of the excellent crop

41:10.340 --> 41:20.640
of women writers who have almost dominated the field since then, uh, we've,
we've had the introduction of character into our stories. They have become more,

41:20.860 --> 41:32.240
uh, much more stories of human interest. See? As, uh, has been pointed out
instead of, we've been exploring the inner universe as much as we've been

41:32.240 --> 41:42.980
exploring the outer universe, perhaps more. Now, this is a great development,
actually. Any literary field that doesn't develop dies. You can see, uh, if you

41:42.980 --> 41:51.000
look at the mystery field, which as a category goes back farther than science
fiction, as a recognized category goes back farther than science fiction, right

41:51.000 --> 42:01.500
into the 19th century. You can see the development there the same way. From the
deductive mystery, Sherlock Holmes type on up to the present day, uh, spy story

42:01.500 --> 42:20.120
like, uh, uh, the Lee Carey stories, you know, uh, the last one of which was
Smiley's Eh, can't remember. But anyway, uh, the type of, uh, there's the action

42:20.120 --> 42:30.980
mystery and there's the spy mystery and so on and so forth. Uh, these periods of
development, I mean, pardon me, not these periods of development, but this

42:30.980 --> 42:42.440
constant, uh, rush of development goes on all the time. And of course, it's had
its effect on science fiction. We have, we have writers nowadays who, uh, who

42:42.440 --> 42:55.280
are much more interested in the effect of, uh, future happenings upon people
than upon future happenings itself. Uh, this, this makes for very interesting,

42:55.580 --> 43:05.700
very interesting fiction. And it's a curious field in that the older writers,
uh, learn from the younger writers. In other words, we shift to, we were writing

43:05.700 --> 43:16.420
earlier and writing the earlier type of science science fiction, uh, learn and
develop along with the field itself. So that the useful elements that come in

43:16.420 --> 43:30.260
later on are picked up and shown in their own work as well. Uh, the, uh, the,
uh, the one thing that doesn't change is the emphasis on, uh, exploration.

43:31.140 --> 43:43.060
Science fiction is one field that has a readership that will allow you to take,
that will allow the author to take a look at anything, to explore any topic. And

43:43.060 --> 43:54.640
because of this, it is, it's very wholesome and very honest. This is one reason,
for example, what the, uh, the whole women, uh, uh, the whole point of the

43:54.640 --> 44:04.340
women's, the whole element of the women's movement, uh, came up in literature.
It was the sort of thing that science fiction could not ignore. If you see

44:04.340 --> 44:14.860
something happening, a change happening in your own lifetime, and you're writing
about the future, you have to assume that there will be future effect from this

44:14.860 --> 44:16.660
happening. Excuse me, time out again.

44:25.080 --> 44:34.620
I'm afraid my voice is going out for good here. Yeah, well, we're, you know,
that's fine, uh, Mr. Dickson. We've, we've really got enough material. Yeah. Um.

44:35.180 --> 44:44.240
I, um, I will have more to say. I hope I am not this croaky when I get down to
the University of Kansas. Yeah, we're, we're almost approaching an hour, so you

44:44.240 --> 44:53.440
put a, you put a lot of talking in. Um, well, listen, then, uh, we sure
appreciate the time. What we'll do is, uh, it probably is going to be, um, fall

44:53.440 --> 45:01.280
sometime before these are edited and sent to you. Right. But I will meet you in,
uh, in Kansas this summer. I'm looking forward to that. Okay. And, uh, listen,

45:01.320 --> 45:10.340
we very much appreciate your time. We know how busy you are. Oh, that's, it's,
life, life picks you up by the strut of the neck and carries you along. I ask

45:10.340 --> 45:22.460
you, you know, you will find yourself in, in doing the same thing, you know, in
a while. Uh, not only, you not only get busier as you go along, but the world

45:22.460 --> 45:30.340
itself gets busier around you. God knows what's going to happen in the long run.
Well, that's the way it seems. I wonder if it's really that way, though. Oh,

45:30.500 --> 45:43.980
yeah. It is. It is. Uh, we have a, uh, there's a number of factors that have
their effect here. One is simply that the world's population is increasing. And

45:43.980 --> 45:51.960
if you look closely at it, you'll see that this increases competition. There are
much more, whatever, whatever your level of competence is, there's, there's more

45:51.960 --> 46:03.840
people at that level in a position to compete with you. Also, uh, we have tools
that have proliferated. Tools, everything from the, uh, dog on a hammer to the

46:03.840 --> 46:16.100
dog on a computer itself. And, uh, we're in a situation, since we live in the
competitive society, in which, uh, the more tools you can handle, uh, the better

46:16.100 --> 46:28.060
position you are in that competition. It makes life easier, more pleasant, and
far more interesting to be able to, to be able to use these tools. And the tools

46:28.060 --> 46:39.960
can be a knowledge of foreign languages, or it can be, as I say, a knowledge of,
of, uh, uh, how to program a computer, see. Or a knowledge of space mechanics,

46:40.120 --> 46:50.840
for that matter. These things become fascinating, particularly the people who
are interested in, in life in general. Yeah, I, um, I'm a medievalist myself.

46:50.840 --> 46:57.980
I've got to get busy here and teach Chaucer in about half an hour. I'm an
English teacher here at the college. Chaucer, uh, Chaucer was one of my

46:57.980 --> 47:07.120
favorites. In fact, Chaucer's contemporary with Hawkwood. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
They, uh, since, since Chaucer was used, as you probably know, on a number of

47:07.120 --> 47:20.160
confidential, uh, diplomatic, uh, sent on confidential diplomatic journeys, uh,
by the king a great deal, uh, the chances that he and Hogwood met are pretty

47:20.160 --> 47:28.600
doggone good. Yeah, okay, I'll be looking forward to those, uh, those future
novels. Listen, Mr. Dickson, we sure appreciate the time, and, uh, I'll be seeing

47:28.600 --> 47:34.780
you in a few weeks in Kansas, and meet you in person. All right, good. Thank you
very much, then. Great. Okay, goodbye.
