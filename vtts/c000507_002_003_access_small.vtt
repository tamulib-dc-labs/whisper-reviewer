00:01.740 --> 00:05.700
The last time we talked to you, you had mentioned that's just what you were finishing up, so

00:05.700 --> 00:08.400
I just wanted to ask a little bit more about it after I read them.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.540
I guess this is sort of a general question, but to concentrate specifically on Q and an

00:14.540 --> 00:16.320
AeroFIL, if I'm saying those correctly.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.180
Yeah, that's correct.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.860
Were they modeled on any particular analogs?

00:20.780 --> 00:21.140
No.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.020
No, not really.

00:25.620 --> 00:28.780
I suppose I'm aware I just came up with a not a full cloth.

00:30.620 --> 00:38.620
Okay, the bigger question, what I was really interested in was the, why is Celtic and Welsh

00:38.620 --> 00:41.100
mythology so appropriate for fantasy?

00:41.100 --> 00:55.780
Well, I think partly because I and probably many of the readers hold our ancestry from

00:55.780 --> 01:04.860
this area, and when you grow up within a culture, you grow up subconsciously with that culture's

01:04.860 --> 01:05.280
myths.

01:05.280 --> 01:14.880
I've taught you many of them in the form of attitudes, the way you look at the world,

01:15.780 --> 01:17.780
expectations and this sort of thing.

01:19.260 --> 01:28.460
I think it's useful for someone to be in contact with the actual mythos of the culture from

01:28.460 --> 01:35.760
which it comes, because that way you can examine more thoroughly the origins and significance

01:35.760 --> 01:37.760
of the attitudes which you may hold.

01:40.020 --> 01:47.000
Okay, you did though use some standard figures from Celtic mythology, didn't you like the

01:47.000 --> 01:50.620
oh, let's say the Grugai, the Puca, the Theishi and so forth?

01:50.620 --> 01:56.540
Yes, they are figures out of Celtic folklore, I guess.

01:57.220 --> 02:07.320
As a matter of fact, as far as I'm aware, all of the figures that I used to come from

02:07.320 --> 02:10.680
that well, as it were.

02:12.760 --> 02:18.340
Okay, you do a great deal to make fantasy characters real, not the usual cardboard stereotypes.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.940
I find this fairly rare in fantasy, and I wondered if it was a conscious effort on your

02:23.940 --> 02:25.960
part, or that's the way you normally would write.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.460
I treat a fantasy character the same way I treat any other character I handle.

02:33.640 --> 02:40.980
I think that, well, myself I'm very bored when I read a character who is an absolute

02:40.980 --> 02:41.640
stereotype.

02:41.640 --> 02:48.260
I suppose that there would be a way to write a stereotype in such a way that they become

02:48.260 --> 02:54.960
interesting, the one that I can think of out hand, is Th White's handling of the character

02:54.960 --> 02:55.740
of Galahad.

02:57.340 --> 03:02.740
He does handle him as a stereotype, but he does it so artfully that you begin to understand

03:02.740 --> 03:05.400
that that's his problem.

03:07.300 --> 03:16.140
A creation which I somewhat admire, but in general, if a writer is not aware exactly

03:16.140 --> 03:24.760
what commodity he's handling, then the writer is in a great deal of difficulty.

03:26.140 --> 03:36.180
Myself, I don't believe that any person I've ever met who's average and perhaps that attitude

03:36.980 --> 03:38.440
spills over into my writing.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.740
Okay, as far as I can tell you've written two books on Eldwood so far.

03:45.080 --> 03:50.500
When you conceived of the idea that series, the two books, did you conceive of it as one,

03:50.620 --> 03:51.940
two, or more books?

03:52.540 --> 03:55.520
No, actually I conceived of it as a short story.

03:57.220 --> 04:06.100
And I got a chance to work with my brother and the two of us together somewhat created

04:06.100 --> 04:13.440
Arafel, made it to visual and I did the story when we did the Don Grant book.

04:13.440 --> 04:22.720
And when it became a novel, I started putting the dream stone together with Eldwood.

04:24.420 --> 04:30.760
And of course they're not long enough for a novel and then I began realizing I was going to have to rewrite the whole thing.

04:31.460 --> 04:41.060
But by the time I'd done all the research that I finally felt that I needed, I had so much material left over

04:42.020 --> 04:45.160
that that's how there happened to be a second book.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.400
That's all that there will be as far as I intend.

04:51.120 --> 04:56.640
Okay, to merchant's luck for just a minute, I guess which is a little before both of those books.

04:57.940 --> 05:03.240
The deal and the emphasis on there, to me anyhow, was on carriage along with a very convincing hard science background.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.640
Did you, I imagine that was quite a bit easier to write than down below station, wasn't it?

05:09.640 --> 05:15.540
It was quite, actually, it was a book I started to write when I discovered I needed background for it.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.920
So down below station happened.

05:20.380 --> 05:28.260
You'll very often find that the books would seem to flow the easiest and to be so simple.

05:29.240 --> 05:35.420
The stories were then quite, quite deceptively simple.

05:35.420 --> 05:42.240
I really do so on the groundwork of a very, very large background.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.920
And that's precisely what happened there.

05:49.700 --> 05:55.120
The world that you've created, the universe you've created for those two books down below station, Merchants's Luck,

05:55.340 --> 05:57.220
is a very complete one.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.600
You've gone to a lot of trouble to set it up.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.760
I wondered if you had sort of, now that you have sort of a future history in hand, if you plan to go on with it?

06:05.140 --> 06:06.160
Well, I already have.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.780
Actually, The Fated Sun sits within it.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.580
It happens considerably in the future.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.720
And in a somewhat different direction, the China books sit within it.

06:23.380 --> 06:28.080
They happen in the opposite direction from the tele.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.920
It's just Telsa, which is Telsa-V.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.480
And actually the only books that don't really fit into it are the band students.

06:40.760 --> 06:46.540
Okay, The Fated Central is one of my favorite series. I guess I hadn't gotten that connection.

06:46.780 --> 06:50.720
Well, actually it's quite remote-centered because it's so far away.

06:50.720 --> 07:00.620
But if you recall, the infamous security organization, ALFIC, is Alliance.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.140
It was founded by Sydney Mallory.

07:05.400 --> 07:12.020
And continually within the Alliance, you have two forces that swing back and forth.

07:12.180 --> 07:19.780
You have the forces of constitutional law as represented by Damon Constantine and down below station.

07:19.780 --> 07:25.400
You have the forces of security in the military as represented by Mallory.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.320
You see a little bit of that in Merchandise Luck.

07:31.420 --> 07:35.020
The less evident down below station because of course it's an transformative theory,

07:35.900 --> 07:37.800
where you certainly see more of Mallory.

07:39.980 --> 07:48.840
And you'll see it again in a book called Forty Thousand in Gehenna, which is, I guess, as of this September.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.720
From Fantasia Press.

07:53.200 --> 08:01.480
And in that one, that's the period just after down below station, in which what I call the Alliance Union period of dirty tricks.

08:03.300 --> 08:09.640
When they formally signed a peace treaty that are out maneuvering for advantage.

08:11.780 --> 08:16.280
And do some rather unwise things to period of Cold War.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.060
Okay, yeah.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.680
Just one more brief question on the world down below station, Merchandise Luck.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.240
Do you plan any more works within that exact same period?

08:35.620 --> 08:37.520
Well, yes, there may be.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.360
I haven't decided.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.380
I'm going to write some more what I call Merchandise Stories.

08:43.380 --> 08:57.220
I think that the figure of the traitor, the person of commerce, after all, what we're going out into space for has been sadly neglected in science fiction.

08:57.660 --> 09:02.040
You know, any fiction is conflict.

09:03.300 --> 09:07.320
And one of the easiest conflicts, of all, to generate is military.

09:09.040 --> 09:32.320
And perhaps in our enthusiasm for writing exciting plots, we go overboard with battles and a feeling, you know, that tomorrow and the future are going to be populated by people with ray guns and warships.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.200
This sort of thing.

09:34.580 --> 09:47.460
And one of the things I've been trying to bring forward is that though perhaps these things will exist in the long run, it's the merchants that are the real heroes.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.640
The ones that ultimately make civilization work.

09:54.060 --> 10:05.100
And in some of the stories that I want to write within this universe, it's going to be a conflict indeed, but it'll be a different sort of conflict.

10:05.100 --> 10:26.760
A conflict of man against hazards, people against adversities of various sorts that are sort of like the tales of the merchant marine instead of the military.

10:29.660 --> 10:34.180
Okay, on the last interview we got listening to it the other day.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.720
We did get a bunch on Richard's luck, even though I hadn't read the book at the time.

10:37.900 --> 10:41.060
So that's probably enough on that particular area.

10:42.460 --> 10:43.640
One I just thought of.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.540
Let me stick an extra question in here.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.040
I'm almost getting down to the end.

10:48.560 --> 10:56.800
Are you moving towards some goal or some vision at the end of this future history, at the end of the civilizations you're setting up?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.740
Well, it's quite a large thing.

11:00.200 --> 11:09.820
I have a book of my own which I doubt the world will ever see, which is merely a list of dates that coordinates the whole thing.

11:10.820 --> 11:26.960
And in the way, I'm telling the story of two superpowers, which begin in about the year 2350 and continue thousands of years into the future in various incarnations.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.540
The shockwave sort of continued through the centuries.

11:32.120 --> 11:45.820
And one of the points is that there are various times the heroes or the villains, some of my stories take place from the union point of view.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.260
Some of them from Alliance.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.480
There are times at which Alliance becomes exceedingly repressive.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.760
Other points at which it is clearly the hero in the story.

11:56.760 --> 12:04.520
There are times in which union becomes very unpleasant in which to live.

12:04.660 --> 12:09.840
And other times at which it affords more freedom than the Alliance does.

12:10.240 --> 12:21.580
So it's more a very long-term story of the life and conduct of states as characters.

12:21.580 --> 12:32.160
But it will never appear in a single book because the story is so strong now over so many different periods and so many different aspects.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.940
I feel like telling, say, the history of Europe and the history of Asia or whatever.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.480
They eventually grow too large even to call them nations.

12:46.340 --> 12:58.240
Okay, in other words, then, you don't have any vision of a future universal Armageddon or some evolutionary spot the human race is moving toward that would, you know, some big culmination of these things?

12:58.840 --> 13:10.080
Well, in a way, a little theme that you saw toward the end of The Bated Sun is a very important marker in this period.

13:12.300 --> 13:16.200
No, I don't see a universal Armageddon. I think we've got more sense than that.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.540
We've at least demonstrated it thus far.

13:22.980 --> 13:30.020
I think that there will be a time, and of course one great change happens within down below the station.

13:30.020 --> 13:41.040
I think it's when, however unwillingly, Earth has to realize that mankind is not to rest real anymore.

13:43.600 --> 13:47.080
There's another important point somewhat further on.

13:48.660 --> 14:04.840
When mankind begins to revise its ancestral ideas about property and place and territoriality, beginning to adapt to space as a lifestyle and a way of thinking.

14:06.680 --> 14:12.520
You see, what they've done at the beginning, they've carried the idea of nationhood and boundaries into space with it.

14:13.940 --> 14:33.620
In an environment where it patently doesn't make much sense, and their contact with the light is somewhat important in informing a part of what becomes a vastly changed outlook on the universe as a whole.

14:36.020 --> 14:43.860
Okay, that book, 40,000 and Gehena, you said that's say between the down below station world and the faded central, is there somewhere between those two?

14:44.260 --> 14:55.320
Yes, it fits actually in between the sequences down below station, Merchandre's look, which sort of overlaps.

14:57.540 --> 15:06.460
Then Serpent's Reach, and then the Faded Sun, give or take, a thousand years or so in intervals.

15:07.200 --> 15:12.800
But Gehena fits in between down below station and Serpent's Reach.

15:14.700 --> 15:20.580
It's a period where Union has decided to cut Alliance off.

15:20.580 --> 15:29.540
Alliance only has one world, and they're really determined to nip that in the bud before they are able to expand to anything else.

15:31.260 --> 15:36.660
And there is, territorially, adjacent to hell.

15:37.360 --> 15:49.540
There's a little spritz of planeted stars, and Union knows it hasn't got enough resources to go in there and take them and develop the planets.

15:50.500 --> 15:57.300
So it decides that it will last them up, so that they become contendable.

15:58.380 --> 16:14.340
And they do that by dropping 38,000 people on each world, without ecological preparation, without anything. They're expendable.

16:16.120 --> 16:23.440
And the idea being that if the colonies take, they will always be a problem for Alliance because they're Union indoctrinated.

16:24.200 --> 16:30.740
If they fail, they will create such ecological disaster that Alliance will never be able to use the place anyway.

16:32.820 --> 16:33.860
Okay, thank you.

16:35.260 --> 16:42.240
Okay, two more. One of them involves your, you've answered this a little bit as you've gone along, some of your future plans.

16:43.420 --> 16:49.060
I guess two things. I would ask sort of a general question about, I assume you'll be writing both fantasy and science fiction in the future.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.140
And secondly, are you planning any more short story collections?

16:55.900 --> 17:01.920
Well, I am...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.400
Okay, short story collections.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.600
Not as such.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.140
If one happens, it will happen.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.600
I suppose that...

17:13.560 --> 17:16.140
Well, I just don't write many short stories.

17:16.760 --> 17:21.100
And most of the short stories I've written have been for, directly for anthologies.

17:21.620 --> 17:34.860
And some of them are going to be the sort of thing that's more or less confined to a particular anthology such as The Pace World, which I do largely for fun.

17:38.540 --> 17:46.600
The question of whether I shall continue to write fantasy, I have, I find...

17:49.860 --> 17:52.500
I used to write a great little more of it than I do now.

17:53.360 --> 17:58.620
And the proportion that I write now is probably the amount that I will continue to write.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.400
Not very much, but some.

18:03.420 --> 18:03.820
Okay.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.800
Okay, I really have one more question.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.980
This is sort of a strange one. I hope you don't take it the wrong way.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.680
But I believe I've read everything that you've published, maybe you missed a few short stories.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.120
But in my opinion, you are getting better.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.260
Now, that's not saying that early science fiction isn't good because it is.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.840
I hope it won't be better.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.900
Well, I was going to ask, are you conscious of yourself getting better?

18:29.120 --> 18:35.000
I'm conscious that things get easier to do.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.780
Perhaps my touch is a little shorter.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.260
It's sort of like riding a horse, you know.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.200
I've just done it a long time. You don't fall off as much.

18:46.060 --> 18:50.420
I can conceive of stories now without any doubt that I can write them.

18:52.320 --> 18:57.040
I used to go much more to the seat of my pants than I do.

18:58.620 --> 19:04.520
I think I'm much more in control of my medium than I was at the beginning.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.480
My goodness, who isn't?

19:06.680 --> 19:09.800
I think you've written a dozen books or so.

19:10.440 --> 19:19.700
You get to the point where you've already discovered how to achieve a certain number of effects.

19:20.460 --> 19:30.280
I hope that I will continue to challenge myself with things that are harder to do.

19:31.240 --> 19:36.060
I think that one of the things that I've enjoyed very much is working.

19:37.520 --> 19:44.220
With a publisher who does not attempt to hold me to one type of literature,

19:45.640 --> 19:49.960
I can write anything I want to write.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.940
I find that's artistically stimulating.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.940
If I conceive of doing a story, I don't have to go before a committee and sell it.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.960
I don't have to promise that I'm going to do it.

20:06.040 --> 20:13.900
I just do it in the confidence that it will work and that it will be bought.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.860
That to me is a very precious kind of artistic freedom.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.780
I hope indeed I am getting better.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.140
I plan to go on getting better.

20:26.700 --> 20:33.540
I don't plan to still at a particular level.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.040
I will continue to experiment with the medium.

20:36.980 --> 20:42.140
Doing occasional strange things and occasional traditional things is the mood takes me.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.640
This is more an observation rather than a question.

20:48.400 --> 20:53.380
I would say the areas that I've been very impressed with and seen you get better in

20:53.380 --> 20:56.380
is one thing, the depth and complexity of your characterization.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.520
But also, especially in these last three books,

20:59.660 --> 21:02.220
Merchandise Luck and Dreamstone and the Tree of Swords and Jewels,

21:02.360 --> 21:07.880
is an economy where you can say so much more in fewer words.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.480
That's very nice.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.800
Economy of expression is something that I'm quite fond of.

21:14.980 --> 21:20.360
I think that one of my earliest idols, oddly enough, is a very dead Roman

21:20.360 --> 21:22.800
to the name of Julius Virgilius Morrow,

21:23.320 --> 21:27.020
who was, I think, one of the world's great masters at that.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.760
Man could say more in two words than most people could achieve in ten

21:33.080 --> 21:38.420
and hit you with the most unexpected turns in the middle of these sentences.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.220
And I always lamented as a student that one couldn't do that in English.

21:47.080 --> 21:52.520
And I did a lot of translating and I did work at it a great deal

21:52.520 --> 21:57.080
trying to achieve what he achieved in the English language coming out of Latin.

21:57.960 --> 22:05.840
Well, I think that it did have quite a bit of effect on my idea of what good style is.

22:06.180 --> 22:13.960
I've always felt that if one could write with economy in plain language

22:13.960 --> 22:18.280
so that you can be easily followed,

22:18.520 --> 22:26.180
that you use the words for maximum effect according to position.

22:28.260 --> 22:34.580
So that things occurred to the reader more or less in the order in which they would occur

22:34.580 --> 22:39.940
to the person in that situation that you had managed to achieve a great load of immediacy

22:39.940 --> 22:50.020
with that effect, that you lived through a scene instead of simply being told about it.

22:50.840 --> 22:55.060
And indeed that is something that I consciously try to achieve,

22:55.060 --> 22:58.480
is to tell the most but I can in the smallest amount of space.

23:00.780 --> 23:01.500
Okay, good.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.340
I'm sure there are a million things I think I've asked,

23:05.480 --> 23:10.600
but then I remember that first interview and I really covered most of the other things I can think of.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.960
So I'll just let that do duty, you know what I've asked before.

23:13.960 --> 23:19.720
So that really, I guess the only thing I would say finally is do you, you know, as brief as this has been,

23:19.840 --> 23:20.700
I'm sure I've left out a lot.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.960
Is there anything you would like to say or get on, you know, to get on that interview that's been published?

23:27.320 --> 23:33.980
Currently I've got a piece coming out this spring called Voyager at Night

23:38.020 --> 23:50.680
and I'm working right now on a sequel to The Pride of Chonor done just because I have a major love of sequels.

23:50.700 --> 23:55.560
But because I do a kind of a future history thing,

23:56.020 --> 24:03.680
sometimes I haven't told quite all of a thing when I get through with an individual plot involving individual people.

24:04.400 --> 24:11.320
So there's more to what happens in the contact than I had a chance to tell in Pride of Chonor.

24:11.940 --> 24:20.680
And there's some questions left unanswered and so all of a sudden the bug hit.

24:20.680 --> 24:27.080
And I felt like doing a book which the Chonor books to me are fun to do.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.720
I enjoy doing it.

24:31.220 --> 24:42.740
And for me they're kind of lighthearted and a chance to deal with a character who absolutely recuses doom and gloom.

24:45.780 --> 24:51.320
So that's been my project for quite a while and actually it got larger than I planned.

24:52.020 --> 24:55.420
So it looks as if there are going to be two Chonor sequels.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.140
As a matter of fact I just started the second one.

25:00.080 --> 25:08.960
My goodness, I would imagine it's not going to be too long and maybe somebody's already done this is to do some kind of essay or timeline on your future history

25:08.960 --> 25:11.420
like I've seen for say Heinlein or Anderson or so forth.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.720
Well some people have inquired about this sort of thing.

25:17.500 --> 25:25.400
The thing that I worry about is that my events currently take place a great distance apart.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.780
I know what the connecting logic is.

25:30.520 --> 25:39.200
As the creator as long as I keep it sort of close to me I can play games with it as I will.

25:39.200 --> 25:44.220
I'm a little nervous about having it set in concrete or print as the case may be.

25:45.320 --> 25:51.180
But I have with or at least I can't even remember if I did it.

25:51.280 --> 26:02.380
I thought at one time about including a little bit of chronology in the tendencies with some of my stories.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.020
I'm not even sure what I got around to doing that.

26:06.500 --> 26:12.680
But I'm a in future stories which may give some people help at any rate.

26:14.540 --> 26:21.480
And I think I could see something like that happening eventually.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.920
Listen, where does Hunter of Worlds fit in?

26:25.120 --> 26:29.820
Oh, Hunter of Worlds is sort of one of those little things that happens often.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.180
A side pocket at a far future time.

26:33.500 --> 26:40.700
It sounds from the viewpoint of the local people very much as if all of humanity is involved.

26:40.920 --> 26:46.460
Actually it's a little area of colonial expansion that didn't work out terribly well.

26:47.360 --> 26:59.920
And I have an idea where it's set which is considerably out beyond where anybody has gotten to yet in my stories.

26:59.920 --> 27:15.880
But it's pretty well out on the trenches I would say probably in the about halfway between Talseti and Sirius.

27:16.040 --> 27:19.520
Trichon out about 40 odd light years.

27:20.360 --> 27:20.620
Plus.

27:22.860 --> 27:23.840
Okay, good.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.300
Listen, I said 10 minutes and I'm sorry I'm well over that now.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.820
I get fascinated talking about these things.

27:30.520 --> 27:38.140
Well listen, as I told you in the later, we're putting together, it's going to be a series of hardback books from this press.

27:38.500 --> 27:39.760
And you're going to be in the first volume.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.340
And this is the first book we've done.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.160
And we're going to have to update all the interviews.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.120
We have to get the author's permissions, the whole thing.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.720
So it's probably going to be, I would say a year at least before it's out.

27:50.720 --> 27:56.980
Oh sure, why are we a figure it's one year between doing it and getting it in the door in the time that it comes out.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.060
But we will obviously send you a copy of it.

28:01.140 --> 28:01.480
Okay.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.180
And we sure appreciate the time you've given us.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.920
I wish you a lot of luck with it.

28:06.020 --> 28:06.760
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.340
We may be seeing it as convention one of these days.

28:08.460 --> 28:08.780
Alright.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.820
Are you headed down to Fantasy Festival?

28:11.620 --> 28:12.400
What is that?

28:12.680 --> 28:13.200
This weekend.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.960
Nope, I'm afraid I can't.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.060
I teach here at the college, or that's the college.

28:18.160 --> 28:18.800
I'm an English teacher.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.380
They got you, huh?

28:20.380 --> 28:23.280
Yeah, I've got a stack of papers to my office ceiling to grade.

28:23.640 --> 28:27.100
And we have two weeks after Thanksgiving before Christmas starts, vacation.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.020
So my Christmas vacation is going to be my big vacation time.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.680
I'm going to California and probably visit some of the places out there.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.620
But I don't know when the next convention I'll go get to is.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.400
But anyhow, good luck with your writing and I'm sure looking forward to it.

28:41.560 --> 28:41.920
Okay.

28:42.180 --> 28:42.540
Thank you.

28:42.700 --> 28:43.040
Thank you.

28:43.100 --> 28:43.260
Bye.
