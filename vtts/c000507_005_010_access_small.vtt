00:11.040 --> 00:18.240
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.240 --> 00:20.460
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.940
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.580 --> 00:33.880
The subject of this show is space exploration.

00:35.440 --> 00:40.460
We're putting two limitations on that subject. One, that the exploration be outside the solar

00:40.460 --> 00:45.180
system, and two, that the story or novel we discuss involve the process of searching or

00:45.180 --> 00:49.020
exploring primarily, not simply the result of the exploration.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.500
And especially with those limitations, I think we have perhaps the purest of all science

00:53.500 --> 00:58.520
fiction themes or plots. Man's history on this planet has been a process of searching,

00:58.700 --> 01:03.620
discovering, then taming or civilizing. The discovery of the New World, for instance,

01:03.920 --> 01:08.440
was the result of a deliberate act of search by various European explorers, culminating

01:08.440 --> 01:15.280
with Columbus. The American West, as discovered and mapped by Lewis and Clark, is a classic

01:15.280 --> 01:22.460
example of exploration. Now, space, or our galaxy, the universe, is simply the next area

01:22.460 --> 01:28.240
to explore and discover and tame. I think the importance and purity of the theme lies in

01:28.240 --> 01:38.420
the notion that searching and discovering is the very essence of human nature. It's

01:38.420 --> 01:38.520
the first step in the process of searching and discovering.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.300
We've discovered the frontiers of Earth, and now we're ready to confront, we must confront,

01:43.020 --> 01:46.220
what one influential science fiction production is called the final frontier.

02:38.420 --> 02:44.000
Star Trek first came on the air in 1966 and continued through 1969, with 78 episodes being

02:44.000 --> 02:49.100
completed for the series. The show had several major science fiction authors writing for it,

02:49.160 --> 02:52.540
including Harlan Ellison, Theodore Sturgeon, and David Gerald.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.120
It would be hard to think of a better example of the space exploration theme. I think Star

02:58.120 --> 03:03.860
Trek epitomizes that, because episode after episode, you saw the members of, crew members of the

03:03.860 --> 03:11.720
Enterprise confront aliens, all sorts of problems in a hostile universe, but they kept going,

03:11.840 --> 03:18.360
their spirit, their courage, their desire to go beyond mankind's limits almost, carried the

03:18.360 --> 03:23.500
show for a long time, and I think it sort of is the essence of the space exploration theme,

03:23.700 --> 03:28.460
for pure exploration's sake. It was a fairly popular show when it was on the air, but it

03:28.460 --> 03:31.960
gained in popularity considerably after it went off the air and went into syndication,

03:32.680 --> 03:37.300
conventions or held Star Trek conventions, and it eventually spawned a movie.

03:38.160 --> 03:43.780
Well, fitting in with your parameters on space exploration, we never saw the Enterprise going

03:43.780 --> 03:49.740
on a particular mission to do something in particular. It was always just out there exploring,

03:50.520 --> 03:55.320
and with no particular thing in mind, and whatever happened to it seemed to happen by accident,

03:55.960 --> 04:00.740
or just, it just happened. They were out there in an alien ship advanced upon them,

04:00.740 --> 04:05.660
or they found some planet with a distress signal calling out, but they were never really going

04:05.660 --> 04:11.480
to any particular place as far as we were told. I believe that really is kind of covered in the

04:11.480 --> 04:16.560
preamble to the show, where William Shatner says they're on that five-year mission to explore

04:17.220 --> 04:22.840
new planets and to discover what's out there. I think that has to be one of the reasons the

04:22.840 --> 04:29.960
show is so popular again, because simply it satisfies people's need for the unknown,

04:30.380 --> 04:36.860
for the search, for the exploration to seek something which is mysterious, which is unknown.

04:37.340 --> 04:43.920
It's simply caught the imagination, I think, of more than simple, more than pure science fiction

04:43.920 --> 04:49.580
fans. I think everybody was fascinated with that kind of theme. I think this is especially shown

04:49.580 --> 04:56.980
in the episode called The Side of Paradise. Yes, I think they did that theme a number of times,

04:56.980 --> 05:02.220
not a number, but every so often. I think that particular episode is the best expression of it,

05:02.220 --> 05:10.240
but they advanced to this particular planet and beamed down as they did on their transporters.

05:11.540 --> 05:16.920
There was a particular planet on this planet that shot spores whenever one of the crew

05:16.920 --> 05:25.280
members got near it. These spores would seemingly, well, cause a state of total happiness, total

05:26.160 --> 05:32.940
contentment in the individual. He didn't have a sense of a goal. He didn't want to strive.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.640
He simply wanted to stagnate. I'm reminded of the poem by Tennyson, The Lotus Eaters,

05:38.980 --> 05:43.440
where the crew of Ulysses ate the lotus plant and wanted to stay on the island forever without

05:43.440 --> 05:49.700
moving, without striving, without trying. Kirk, the captain, Captain Kirk is one of the few who

05:49.700 --> 05:57.960
was not infected by the spores. With the power of his personality, his cleverness, he is able to

05:58.800 --> 06:03.900
overturn the influence these spores have had on his crew members. But I think the significance of

06:03.900 --> 06:10.880
it is that they are going to continue. They're not satisfied. They're not content. They would have

06:10.880 --> 06:16.140
been perfectly happy to live the rest of their existence on this planet. It was sort of an

06:16.140 --> 06:20.360
Eden, a paradise. But that's not enough for people. They need a goal. They need something to

06:20.360 --> 06:26.240
strive for, or they're not human. And Kirk is able to get the crew members back to their original

06:26.240 --> 06:33.300
states and the enterprise goes on. For an example of a novel that deals strictly in this type of

06:33.300 --> 06:41.960
space exploration, let's turn to a novel called The Voyage of the Space Beagle. It's written by

06:41.960 --> 06:48.080
a collection of four short stories that he tied together with a new character. The original

06:48.080 --> 06:54.620
short stories were Black Destroyer and Discord and Scarlet written in 1939, M33 and Andromeda

06:54.620 --> 07:02.580
written in 1943, and War of Nerves written in 1950. These four stories he took and tied together

07:02.580 --> 07:11.220
with the theme of going out and exploring space with these four episodes becoming four things

07:11.220 --> 07:17.740
that happen to the ship and the people on it. In each of the stories we meet a different kind of

07:17.740 --> 07:24.700
alien and have to deal with it in a life and death situation. The first of these episodes takes

07:24.700 --> 07:31.180
place when the crew lands on an alien planet and is discovered by a creature named Curl. Curl is a

07:31.180 --> 07:36.580
cat-like creature and he soon lures his way on board the ship. The scientists are very eager to

07:36.580 --> 07:42.240
study him and see what his physiological makeup is like and how his psychology has adapted into this

07:42.240 --> 07:48.460
type of planet and generally what he is. Elliot Groesvenor, the main character that ties the

07:48.460 --> 07:57.300
stories together, is somewhat suspect of Curl and his suspicions are well founded. In an accident,

07:57.560 --> 08:05.440
they discover that Curl can control electrical energies through his body and once Curl discovers

08:05.440 --> 08:10.760
that the human beings have learned this from him, he becomes immediately very fearful of them. He's a

08:10.760 --> 08:19.020
very very powerful creature and they lock him inside a cage but he manages to negate the

08:19.020 --> 08:27.180
electronic lock and get out and starts horribly killing the crewman and then running back to the

08:27.180 --> 08:34.380
sail and locking him back inside it hoping to create a panic on board the ship. The crew almost

08:34.380 --> 08:40.040
immediately discovers what is happening and becomes a war between the crew and the creature.

08:41.560 --> 08:48.740
In the end, Curl leaves the ship by means of a lifeboat because he doesn't understand the

08:48.740 --> 08:56.300
faster than light driving the ship. He attempts to fly back toward his planet but he's traveling away

08:56.300 --> 09:00.480
from his planet faster than he is traveling toward it when he leaves the ship and even though he's

09:00.480 --> 09:06.220
flying toward his planet, his planet still recedes into the distance and he goes insane trying to

09:06.220 --> 09:13.640
figure this out. The second episode in the book which is one of the original short stories is

09:13.640 --> 09:20.960
about a race of aliens that are very bird-like called the rim or the rim people. They have an

09:20.960 --> 09:26.780
entirely mental existence. They communicate by telepathy and they try to contact the space beagle

09:26.780 --> 09:32.440
with their mental emanations through telepathy and they're friendly. All they want to do is contact

09:32.440 --> 09:40.520
the ship but it creates havoc on the space beagle. This mental power that enters the spaceship

09:40.520 --> 09:46.900
drives some of them in mad. It causes psychological aberrations. It brings out hostilities. It

09:46.900 --> 09:54.520
exaggerates certain mental conditions in the crew and Grossman or the same one who was suspicious

09:54.520 --> 10:01.940
of Curl in the previous episode is able with his specialized equipment to mentally contact the

10:01.940 --> 10:07.360
rim to let them know what's happening and ask them to call off their attack which is done and

10:07.360 --> 10:13.940
the space beagle is allowed to continue. The third section of the book deals with a somewhat

10:13.940 --> 10:20.420
different type of alien. The space beagle is voyaging between galaxies in intergalactic space

10:20.420 --> 10:27.400
where there is absolutely nothing. When all of a sudden they come across the path of an alien

10:27.400 --> 10:35.400
who seems to be floating in this intergalactic void. The alien had no hope of ever reaching

10:35.400 --> 10:41.780
one of the galaxies. He was stranded out there when the ship just happened to pass by and the

10:41.780 --> 10:48.960
alien immediately taps some of the energy from the drive of the ship and stops the ship dead in

10:48.960 --> 10:56.040
its tracks. The humans crawl out of the ship and fix the exterior and then they notice the alien

10:56.040 --> 11:03.260
floating right by the ship. The alien comes aboard the ship after they try to capture him in a cage

11:04.380 --> 11:12.380
and immediately recognizes the situation as being very advantageous to him. This creature is extremely

11:12.380 --> 11:19.600
powerful and he's from an ancient civilization that existed in the previous cycle of the universe.

11:20.200 --> 11:25.380
When that universe exploded this creature was shot out into the place where they found him

11:25.380 --> 11:34.720
without any hope of gaining access to a galaxy. When he meets the men he is able to use them as

11:34.720 --> 11:41.140
host creatures or bodies for his eggs in order to raise up more of these creatures.

11:42.460 --> 11:51.420
The Ixtel as the alien is called in the book takes over part of the ship and it's really a race

11:51.420 --> 11:57.180
between him and the rest of the humans as to who's going to control. If the humans allow him to

11:57.940 --> 12:02.700
gain the upper hand he will eventually control all of the galaxy that they're going to.

12:03.640 --> 12:12.100
The only way that the humans could rid themselves of Ixtel was by using their mental agility and

12:12.100 --> 12:18.200
leaving the ship long enough that they could impose a force field of energy that would kill the

12:18.200 --> 12:24.280
creature. The creature found out what they were doing just in time to escape and he got back into

12:24.280 --> 12:30.000
his original fix floating out in middle of intergalactic space with no hope of ever gaining

12:30.580 --> 12:37.700
access to the galaxy as the humans went on to their next episode. The last one involves

12:37.700 --> 12:45.200
the creature very difficult to describe it's sort of a cloud a huge cloud creature without any

12:45.200 --> 12:51.200
particular name but it feeds on death it started out as a very small small organism.

12:52.380 --> 12:57.720
It's first of all it fed on the deaths of insects then smaller animals and larger animals.

12:57.840 --> 13:05.340
It kept growing all the while and it's gotten so huge that it needs the the deaths of creatures

13:05.340 --> 13:12.640
on an entire planet to exist. So it's gained the power and the size and the strength to terraform

13:12.640 --> 13:17.640
planets and as the space beagle goes through a particular system they find that all of the

13:17.640 --> 13:24.100
planets they're passing are similar. They're covered with tropical vegetation with large

13:24.960 --> 13:30.260
primitive kinds of animals engaged in conflict which leads to to many deaths that this creature is

13:30.260 --> 13:36.780
feeding on. The scientists on the space beagle figure out what's happening and realize that their

13:36.780 --> 13:41.820
own solar system is in great danger because this creature is expanding all the time and they're

13:41.820 --> 13:46.260
afraid it's going to come to their own solar system. So they devise a plan whereby they

13:47.140 --> 13:53.220
they start destroying the planets that the creature is feeding on and lure him out into

13:54.140 --> 13:59.940
interstellar space where he is not allowed where he's not able to feed so that he is going to he

13:59.940 --> 14:06.120
will we know die away from the source of the death which nourishes him. So again through their

14:06.120 --> 14:11.780
cleverness through their ingenuity the the humans have triumphed over an alien which when you come

14:11.780 --> 14:16.120
right down to it is much more powerful than they are and I believe that typifies a lot of the things

14:16.120 --> 14:22.320
in the novel in that the humans are always overcoming their adversaries by means of their

14:22.320 --> 14:30.180
cleverness. They seem to outwit aliens that are much more powerful than they are physically and

14:30.540 --> 14:36.820
in some instances by specialized powers that they have. Curl could manipulate electromagnetic

14:37.920 --> 14:43.840
energies and Ixtel could move through solid matter but even with these abilities

14:43.840 --> 14:50.460
the humans by their own ingenuity could outwit their adversaries. I think we should say something

14:50.460 --> 14:55.800
for the aliens though in most of the pulp novels of the time that this one was written

14:56.260 --> 15:00.920
we have so many of the bug-eyed monsters that are nothing more than monsters. Here we have

15:00.920 --> 15:08.560
aliens that are truly intelligent and are fighting humans on a much greater level than just physical

15:08.560 --> 15:16.660
terror. They they're well thought out they have purpose and a plan and we can say that these are

15:16.660 --> 15:21.960
really better aliens than what you would expect to find in most of the pulp novels of this time.

15:22.580 --> 15:26.340
I think that tradition that change in the way the bug-eyed monsters were

15:26.960 --> 15:30.740
were written about in science fiction came back in the 30s with Stanley Weinbaum,

15:31.040 --> 15:37.020
Martian Odyssey and Asimov is described that as the first science fiction story in which the aliens

15:37.720 --> 15:43.280
are not simply humans in a strange form. They have their own reasons for existing,

15:43.280 --> 15:48.340
they have their own ecology, they belong to a particular planet and they're part of that planet.

15:48.740 --> 15:57.280
I think all of the aliens in this particular book are the realistic in terms of having an ecology

15:57.280 --> 16:03.700
built around them and having a psychology, a physiology which is not human. How shall we

16:03.700 --> 16:10.420
characterize this novel and is it pulp fiction or is it something superior to that? Well when

16:10.420 --> 16:14.020
Van Vogt started writing the stories he was writing in the pulp tradition, it was still in the late

16:14.020 --> 16:18.800
30s when he started to write these stories which became the space beagle. But I think he goes

16:18.800 --> 16:24.600
beyond that. He has a, even though he was trained in the pulp tradition, I think he has a more skill,

16:24.920 --> 16:29.740
he's more modern perhaps under the influence of the editor John Campbell and he's able to go

16:29.740 --> 16:36.140
beyond the pulp formulas. These are realistic aliens, the humans in the book are characterized by

16:36.960 --> 16:41.780
realistic motives, they're not simply the plain hero types, they have their quirks, they have their

16:41.780 --> 16:46.620
bad points to humans. In fact they all have to overcome the bad parts of human nature

16:47.220 --> 16:52.360
before they can defeat the aliens themselves. So I think this is a step beyond the pulp tradition

16:52.360 --> 17:00.100
even though the formulas and all the intentions of the story I think are the same as the early

17:00.100 --> 17:02.440
pulp magazines but Van Vogt is able to go beyond that.

17:15.620 --> 17:21.000
For our second consideration we turn to a novel by Paul Anderson written in 1970.

17:21.580 --> 17:26.840
Tau Zero is a special kind of a science fiction book. There's not very many just like it.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.780
That's only one category that Anderson writes with is the kind of book that Tau Zero is.

17:33.040 --> 17:38.600
He writes almost anything. He writes pure fantasy, he'll write so-called soft or social science fiction

17:39.100 --> 17:43.880
but there's nobody better at writing hard science fiction than Paul Anderson. I think Tau Zero is

17:44.420 --> 17:49.080
perhaps his best example in that particular form because there's a great deal of science in the

17:49.080 --> 17:53.460
book and some readers might even think that it's a little obtrusive if they don't understand some

17:53.460 --> 17:57.280
of the concepts of relativity and the Bussard ramjet for instance.

17:58.340 --> 18:04.720
The science in the novel actually makes it extremely realistic. It's one of the more believable

18:05.400 --> 18:15.500
of the pure space epics that's ever been written. The story is essentially that of a colony ship,

18:15.980 --> 18:21.220
a ship full of people I think about 50 people who are traveling to a colony at a nearby star

18:21.220 --> 18:28.900
to set up and start life there and on the way after they've gone part of the way toward the star

18:29.560 --> 18:38.600
the ship runs into a small nebula of gas which causes the ship to lose its power of deceleration.

18:38.900 --> 18:46.280
They cannot decelerate without causing so much radiation harm that they would all be killed.

18:47.040 --> 18:55.460
The only way that they can hope to exist is to keep on accelerating until they can get to a place

18:55.460 --> 19:01.540
that is relatively free of gas where they can go outside the ship outside of the protective barriers

19:02.280 --> 19:11.800
and shielding of the ship to repair that deceleration device. The story that develops is that the ship

19:11.800 --> 19:18.760
cannot find a place that is free enough of gas that they can go out and repair the ship

19:18.760 --> 19:24.700
and it keeps on accelerating until it's actually going through galaxies.

19:25.760 --> 19:30.080
But no matter how fast they go they can never go beyond the speed of light because Anderson,

19:30.560 --> 19:37.100
as we said before, is extremely true to the scientific knowledge of our day and according

19:37.100 --> 19:43.240
to the knowledge that we have faster than light travel is impossible so he has to dream up a method

19:43.240 --> 19:49.560
whereby this exploration trip can go fast enough to get somewhere and he's devised or he's used

19:50.200 --> 19:56.860
a ship called the Bussard Ramjet to do this. The Bussard Ramjet is not a new idea. It was

19:56.860 --> 20:05.420
invented somewhere in the middle of this century. The basic format is that the ship picks up interstellar

20:05.420 --> 20:12.640
gas molecules by the use of a huge electromagnetic web of sorts, a force field if you will,

20:13.200 --> 20:19.780
that scoops up these interstellar particles and shoots them out the back end. This provides

20:19.780 --> 20:26.660
reaction mass which drives the ship forward. The point is that the faster the ship goes,

20:27.060 --> 20:35.060
the more gas molecules it supposedly will contact and shoot out the back end there by increasing

20:35.060 --> 20:43.900
its speed more and more and more on a vicious cycle. The ship would be extremely radioactive

20:45.260 --> 20:50.700
to the point where there would be needed extreme shielding for any human beings to

20:51.580 --> 20:58.780
be able to ride the thing. I believe in the works of Larry Niven he had the same kind of a ship

20:58.780 --> 21:03.840
that was not habitable and he had robots that used this ship and everybody else had to come

21:03.840 --> 21:10.760
along on the slow boats. Here however, Paul Anderson has had this ship big enough and sealed well

21:10.760 --> 21:17.360
enough that humans can ride it. The trouble is when they hit that gas cloud that it not only

21:17.360 --> 21:23.180
destroyed their deceleration method, it also sped them up quite a bit to the point where they were

21:23.180 --> 21:28.900
already past where they would have had to stop and turn around and slow down to get to their

21:29.460 --> 21:34.620
original destination. The speed of the ship is one of the basic problems the crew must overcome.

21:35.340 --> 21:40.300
The great speed brings the theory of relativity into play. One of the basic concepts of the

21:40.300 --> 21:45.160
theory of relativity is that the speed that time passes is relative to the speed that an

21:45.160 --> 21:51.140
object is moving. If you have two ships traveling through space with ship A traveling faster than

21:51.140 --> 21:58.280
ship B, time will be moving slower on ship A than on ship B. In other words, the faster a ship moves,

21:58.280 --> 22:03.680
the slower time passes on that ship relative to other slower moving objects surrounding it.

22:04.560 --> 22:09.240
Everything appears normal on the ship to the crew and time seems to be passing faster on objects

22:09.240 --> 22:15.800
traveling slower than the ship. As hours and days pass on the ship, months and years pass on earth,

22:16.240 --> 22:20.240
and the faster they travel, the greater this time difference becomes. Eventually the crew,

22:20.300 --> 22:24.320
while traveling between galaxies, watches the universe collapse into a huge mass.

22:25.260 --> 22:35.340
This ties in the currently accepted theories of the origin of the universe by most of the scientific

22:36.340 --> 22:43.680
world. The Big Bang theory, of course, in which the universe began as one monomass of

22:44.920 --> 22:52.140
energy that explodes outward. There are two currently popular views of this. One is that

22:52.140 --> 22:58.040
the universe would then continue to expand until it eventually burnt itself out, and that would be

22:58.040 --> 23:05.800
all a one-time only affair. Or that the universe would again withdraw by gravitational force

23:05.800 --> 23:12.620
back into a monomass and explode again, thus doing it numerable times, limitless times.

23:13.340 --> 23:19.980
This is the cyclic theory, and this is what Paul Anderson portrays in Tau Zero. The people on board

23:19.980 --> 23:29.860
the ship go so fast that the universe dies around them. The time has passed exterior to the ship

23:30.700 --> 23:34.640
in great quantities. Of course, earth and all of its peoples and,

23:34.680 --> 23:42.020
assumably, humankind is long gone, and they are the only ones left. And they're waiting out

23:42.900 --> 23:48.500
the result of this withdrawal of the universe back into a monomass to see what happens, hopefully

23:48.500 --> 23:54.120
for them it will explode again. It's one of the things that Anderson tries to bring across is the

23:54.120 --> 23:58.880
incredible amount of time that has passed while they've been on this incredibly fast flight across

23:58.880 --> 24:04.480
the universe. Millions and billions of years have passed as the universe contracts back down into one

24:04.480 --> 24:10.960
large monomass before it explodes back out and creates new galaxies, new solar systems. And at

24:10.960 --> 24:16.600
the end of the novel, they eventually land on one. They're able to slow down, and they land on one,

24:16.600 --> 24:23.080
and begin to colonize. And presumably then they will carry on the human race simply from the

24:23.080 --> 24:28.740
50 members on this ship that have survived into a new universe. To me, that's one of the most

24:28.740 --> 24:34.880
fascinating of all exploration, journeys of exploration, is to see the death of a universe

24:34.880 --> 24:46.580
in the beginning of another one. That's fascinating the way Anderson treats that material. It's

24:46.580 --> 24:52.600
a theme to strive, to seek, to never give up. And particularly with two characters on the book,

24:52.740 --> 24:58.120
I think we see Anderson attempting to show two sides of human nature that allow it to persist

24:58.120 --> 25:05.500
and to survive. You have a woman, Ingrid Lindgren, who is second in command on the ship. She

25:05.500 --> 25:12.880
epitomizes feeling, emotion, love, compassion. We have Charles Raymott, who is the, I guess you'd

25:12.880 --> 25:16.100
call him the policeman, the only military man on board who is there to keep order.

25:16.660 --> 25:22.420
He is pure practicality, pure survival. He'll do anything to survive. He's very an emotional,

25:22.620 --> 25:29.280
very practical man. Together, those two are able to keep the crew intact. They're able to give it

25:29.280 --> 25:37.120
hope. And they are the ones who are able to, well, allow the crew to survive into this new

25:37.120 --> 25:42.140
universe where humanity will keep going. The voyage of the space beagle in tau zero, I think we

25:42.140 --> 25:48.000
would call two of the more classic treatments of the space exploration theme. But there are many

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
and ingenious methods, many varied ways that authors have come up with to illustrate that

25:53.000 --> 26:00.300
particular theme. Always, I think, showing the desire of the human spirit to escape any kind

26:06.740 --> 26:30.280
of restraint. One early example, I think, and probably still one of the

26:30.300 --> 26:36.880
more popular ones is the idea that Heinlein illustrated in Orphans of the Sky, published from

26:36.880 --> 26:43.460
two earlier short stories in 1941. He uses the device of a generation ship, which is an artificial

26:43.460 --> 26:51.440
world, complete and self-sufficient, constructed and inhabited by human beings, which is sent slowly

26:51.440 --> 26:56.880
toward the stars. The original members won't live to arrive, of course, but their descendants will,

26:56.880 --> 27:02.400
many generations removed. And that is one method of space exploration, although one which is a

27:03.040 --> 27:08.600
little discouraging, I guess, to the original crew. In the film Dark Star, the protagonists are

27:08.600 --> 27:14.260
traveling throughout our galaxy, discovering new solar systems which have habitable planets on them

27:14.260 --> 27:19.620
and destroying all the unstable planets in that system in order to make the system safe for colonization.

27:20.200 --> 27:27.240
And one other rather unusual story we might mention is by Larry Niven. It's called Rammer. It was a

27:27.240 --> 27:33.680
short story and then made into a novel, A World Out of Time. Here, a corpse sickle, a person who has

27:33.680 --> 27:38.720
had himself frozen in order that he might be revived later for medical treatment, I think the

27:38.720 --> 27:45.420
fellow had cancer or some such disease, awakes into a future society where they want him for

27:45.420 --> 27:50.920
only one purpose or they don't want him at all, and that's to pilot a starship. The fellow is amazed,

27:51.080 --> 27:57.380
but he goes along with it because it's his only hope for life, takes the starship and escapes away

27:57.380 --> 28:03.400
from the society that has programmed him to do their seeding of planets that they want him to do,

28:03.840 --> 28:09.040
and goes out on his own to explore the galaxy or whatever he finds that meets his interest.

28:22.900 --> 28:29.240
Space exploration is the cornerstone of postulative fiction, for the earth is well known and has

28:29.240 --> 28:35.020
become a very small place in a very big universe. If man is to leave the earth as he has already

28:35.020 --> 28:40.960
begun to do, he will have to explore, whether it's for the sake of exploring or for practical

28:40.960 --> 28:46.780
reasons of colonization and exploitation or both. Although there are science fiction stories that

28:46.780 --> 28:52.200
do not deal in off earth settings, the majority by far are based on the assumption of space travel

28:52.200 --> 28:59.040
and exploration, as we try to imagine what could lie ahead for humanity in the worlds of tomorrow.
