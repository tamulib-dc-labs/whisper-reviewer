00:01.160 --> 00:05.820
How was my trip out? As usual,

00:06.080 --> 00:19.620
hectic and hastily planned, we always seem to, even though we have the best
intentions of getting everything together well in advance and very organized and

00:19.620 --> 00:31.420
business-like, we tend not... But if I ask a dumb question or something like
that, just say, oh wait a minute, back We chop all that stuff out. Yeah, it's no

00:31.420 --> 00:37.860
problem. Or if I make a dumb answer. We chop that out too. Okay.

00:41.140 --> 00:51.760
Let's start off with the basic one. When did you get interested or when did
you're interested in art development? I think it developed when I was born. My

00:51.760 --> 01:01.220
father's always worked as a... worked in the space industry or in the missiles
and space industry, So I had that input around me. He had always been reading

01:01.220 --> 01:12.080
science fiction since I was young, so I had the magazines around to look at. And
some of my earliest recollections are of looking at the covers of old amazing

01:12.080 --> 01:20.420
stories, magazines or paperback books. And in fact, some of them influenced me
to a great deal. Before I could even read or write, I remember looking at some

01:20.420 --> 01:36.020
of those covers for hours and absorbing the visual feeling of the paintings.
There were a few that were especially captivating for me. And I remember them to

01:36.020 --> 01:44.460
this day, exactly what the paintings looked like. And I can describe to you the
compositions and some of the colors of the paintings. And it's a funny thing. At

01:44.460 --> 01:53.080
the last World Science Fiction Convention, I was walking down by one of the
dealer's tables in the dealer's room. and I just started going through some of

01:53.080 --> 02:01.980
the paperback books and I saw one of the covers that I remembered from when I
was three years old or whatever. It was interesting to me because I hadn't been

02:01.980 --> 02:11.060
able, in retrospect, to pinpoint the exact time when I started really being
fascinated by science fiction imagery. And this book had been published in 1952

02:11.060 --> 02:21.800
or 1953, so being born in 1950 that pretty much establishes the beginning of
that at around three years old or so. but the fact that it meant so much to me

02:21.800 --> 02:32.200
that I remembered that exact cover until my present age says something about how
I guess it was just a part of me that that kind of imagery was important to me.

02:32.760 --> 02:43.240
But later when I began to read, I became an avid reader of all types of
literature, but especially science fiction and fantasy. And I had an interest in

02:43.240 --> 02:52.460
art, so the two combined, and it seemed natural to me too. to read and try to
draw what I read. And I would come home sometimes from science-fiction movies or

02:52.460 --> 03:01.140
movies that I enjoyed and tried to illustrate scenes that I'd seen in the movie
from memory. And that carried on pretty much right into my college years.

03:04.940 --> 03:21.580
I can continue beyond that point. Because in college, I had been laboring under
the assumption that I had to have a real type of profession. This is largely due

03:21.580 --> 03:29.500
to input from my parents, but I felt that I had to be something professional,
like a lawyer, something respectable, which being an artist isn't.

03:32.340 --> 03:40.800
So I was diverted during my college years into wanting to become a doctor, which
is still a major interest of mine, anatomy and physiology and the sciences in

03:40.800 --> 03:51.080
general were always important to me. But about three quarters of the way through
my college education, I decided to abandon my pre-med training and go full

03:51.080 --> 03:59.180
scale. Well, actually, it wasn't until my last year of college that I decided a
full tilt to go into illustrating or painting, and I graduated with a degree in

03:59.180 --> 04:08.560
painting. If I had taken one more course, I would have had a degree in biology
with an emphasis on anatomy and physiology, human anatomy and physiology. To go

04:08.560 --> 04:16.480
up and attack on that, does that background, or how does that background help
you when you're painting? It helps me a lot in several ways. First of all, in

04:16.480 --> 04:31.100
constructing alien forms by just extrapolating upon comparative biology. I can
develop a life form that's both interesting visually and somewhat convincingly

04:31.100 --> 04:41.320
suited for a particular environment on another planet. There's that. And also,
it helps me in constructing a human form because I did a lot of dissection. and

04:41.320 --> 04:51.300
I know my human anatomy fairly well. Whereas I know a lot of artists who don't,
they know surface anatomy but they can't really construct a person well out of

04:51.300 --> 05:00.260
their imagination without at least the extensive use of photographs and that's
something I try to avoid. I think it shows in an artist's painting when one uses

05:00.260 --> 05:07.100
a photograph to develop the person and then tries to create the rest of the
painting out of one's imagination, you see a real dichotomy between the way the

05:07.100 --> 05:17.400
person's painted and the rest of the painting is painted. If it all comes out of
your mind, then it all looks like one product or whatever. But one of the jobs I

05:17.400 --> 05:26.500
had when I was putting myself through college was working in the anatomy and
physiology labs at the university I went to preparing the cadavers for the

05:26.500 --> 05:35.380
classes. And during that time, I managed to get some work in doing medical
illustrations. All this combined to really give me a good fundamental education

05:35.380 --> 05:47.620
in the way the body is made up. You had some further training going in, are you?
Yes, after college I went to, I wasn't, the teachers told me I was ready for a

05:47.620 --> 05:53.800
professional career, but I didn't know what I wanted to do yet. I mean, I still
didn't, well, I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't have the confidence

05:53.800 --> 06:02.460
really to throw everything I had into a career in illustration. I didn't know
really where to start. So to get that kind of professional polish, I enrolled in

06:02.460 --> 06:06.040
the Arts Center College of Design in L.A.

06:09.140 --> 06:20.980
Now in Pasadena, they moved after I left. But I only went there for nine months
because I felt that they didn't have much to teach me after I was in there. And

06:20.980 --> 06:30.360
a couple of my teachers advised me just to drop out and go ahead and start
working. So I sent some samples of my work to publishers in New York, and a

06:30.360 --> 06:39.140
couple of them bit. So I threw everything I had into the back of my Volkswagen,
drove out from California to the East Coast to find my fortune. Was one of those

06:39.140 --> 06:51.100
where Donald Wollheim? Yes, Donald Wollheim of DAW Books was very interested in my
work and quite supportive, really, in my early years. Just a bit of a story.

06:51.280 --> 07:04.720
When you got your first cover job, how did that happen? What happened there?
There was a couple of ways that it happened. Excuse me. And I had a portfolio of

07:04.720 --> 07:12.000
items. You know, I came out to the East Coast and sat down and for two weeks,
just painted straight through. I came out with seven pieces in the end of that

07:12.000 --> 07:17.100
time. Excuse me. Hold that for me to cut out. All my cough in the middle.

07:20.120 --> 07:30.920
Anyway, I had a portfolio of pieces. And I went around first to Marvel Comics.
You know, I'm starting low, at least in my opinion at this point. I showed it to

07:30.920 --> 07:39.100
Roy Thomas, who was the editor-in-chief at that time, and he bought three pieces
out of the portfolio. So my first cover assignments weren't really commissioned

07:39.100 --> 07:47.760
from me. They were bought from me because they were already done. Now, it's true
that after he bought those, he required extensive changes in the work, something

07:47.760 --> 07:58.120
that still bothers me to this day. But anyway, that's how that happened. Now,
with Don Wollheim, he saw slides of my work, of course, in California. And later

07:58.120 --> 08:05.120
I went in to see him when I came out to the East Coast, and he gave me a
manuscript for a book, and I took it home, did some sketches for the manuscript

08:06.280 --> 08:13.680
based upon ideas that I thought would make good cover ideas, and he selected one
and gave me the go-ahead, and that became the painting. That's pretty much how I

08:13.680 --> 08:22.860
work on every book cover. Okay, Rob, I understand you're reading a manuscript
now for something. Several. Several. Yeah. Why don't you go through how that

08:22.860 --> 08:28.280
process works for you. What, actually? Pick a specific.

08:31.060 --> 08:41.680
Boy, that's hard. Every book is so different. How about that one? Oh, The White
Dragon, yeah. That's going back a way. That's back in 77 or 78 when I did that.

08:42.240 --> 08:51.840
Let me think. Well, I read the book one time, just read it as a reader, so to
speak. Then I go through it again the second time as an illustrator, making

08:51.840 --> 09:06.320
notes in margins about details of the way people and objects and things look,
making sure that I try to catch all the details so I don't make someone who's

09:06.320 --> 09:14.780
blonde, black-haired, or whatever, because I like to be really true to the story
as much as possible, especially if I'm taking a narrative approach to doing an

09:14.780 --> 09:25.780
illustration. after going through it that second time i'll sit down and start to
develop thumbnail sketches which are just a small drawings um on scrap paper

09:25.780 --> 09:35.980
actually and try to formulate an idea of what i i would like to illustrate from
that book there's usually something in any book no matter how bad or good that

09:35.980 --> 09:46.160
uh will make a good painting it's a matter of digging through it and finding
what interests you and what will motivate you to do a really good job. So I go

09:46.160 --> 09:55.560
through it and try to collate all my different ideas and put it together into a
painting. That is the mysterious part that I can't really describe to you, how

09:55.560 --> 10:04.480
that happens. I guess that's what makes me what I am, is that process there of
distilling what I've read into something that's a visual image that captures

10:04.480 --> 10:18.160
what's in the book. but that process takes a few days to do, and sometimes I get
an instant image. The cover I just did for Robert A. Heinlein's book, Friday, I

10:18.160 --> 10:27.240
had an instantaneous concept of what that cover was going to look like. As soon
as I finished reading the book the first time, I had, I think, a perfectly clear

10:27.240 --> 10:37.780
idea of what Friday looked like, and I knew that the cover to this book had to
be a portrait of this character because the character had such personality

10:37.780 --> 10:48.360
that really the book was written around her personality, I think. And so that
was my approach there. With other books, like The White Dragon, it involved a

10:48.360 --> 10:56.340
much more laborious process because there were so many good scenes to choose
from. It's hard to figure out which one would be the best one for the book and

10:56.340 --> 10:58.120
which one is my favorite.

11:00.920 --> 11:11.260
So it takes a little bit more time. Eventually, I come to somewhere between one
and eight images that I think I like, and if I'm terribly indecisive, I'll send

11:11.260 --> 11:21.240
it to the publisher or to the art editor or whatever who makes that kind of
decision in a particular company. He or she will choose the one that they like

11:21.240 --> 11:32.140
the most and make the decision for me. And then once I'm given the ball, I run
with it and do the final painting, the major painting. And that becomes a book

11:32.140 --> 11:43.640
cover. do you need feedback from the authors yes lots of times in fact with
Friday I got a phone call from Robert A. Heinlein about a couple months after I

11:43.640 --> 11:51.820
turned in the painting to Ballantine Del Rey they sent him a cover proof which is
a first run color tryout of what the cover is going to look like and he called

11:51.820 --> 12:02.280
me up to tell me it was a little flattery I guess he told me it was the best
cover he ever had on a book of his which is is really quite a statement for

12:02.280 --> 12:10.160
someone who's been in the field as long as he has. And to have an author tell me
that I've captured a particular character or scene exactly the way they had it

12:10.160 --> 12:20.160
in mind is probably, for me, the highest praise that an illustrator can get. And
that really had me floating up by the ceiling for a couple weeks to think that

12:20.160 --> 12:27.760
he would bother to call me to tell me that. But sometimes before I do a
painting, I'll correspond with an author or talk to him or her on the phone to

12:27.760 --> 12:38.780
establish certain details. With the white dragon, for example, I talked to Anne
McCaffrey at length about the actual details of the dragons. As she saw the

12:38.780 --> 12:47.560
dragons in her book, whether they had fork tails or tails that ended in a point
or whatever, or a barb or whatever, and what their skin was like and what the

12:47.560 --> 12:56.420
texture was, so that I could try to capture her image of what they looked like.
It's kind of silly for someone who's an illustrator to try to make all that up

12:56.420 --> 13:05.080
when you can contact the author and get the details, if they're not in the book,
straight from the person who thought them up. When you did A Friday, weren't you

13:05.080 --> 13:18.320
working in a new medium airbrush? Oh, no. I've been using the airbrush since
1975. The difference lately is that I'm using it a bit more than I was in the

13:18.320 --> 13:27.880
past. Now, in Friday, there is no airbrush work in the foreground, in the
figure. that's all done with washes to create that smooth skin tone. And I

13:27.880 --> 13:35.240
deliberately went about doing that painting with the idea of giving a real
photographic quality to what you're seeing so that you could reach out and touch

13:35.240 --> 13:47.040
her, so to speak. Which is also a very important part of that character. The
background, though, is composed of a lot of airbrush work. And I usually keep my

13:47.040 --> 13:56.420
airbrush work to the background because I don't want it to dominate a painting.
I hate to work an airbrush, frankly, because it's so tedious and I'm so clumsy

13:56.420 --> 14:07.140
that I often spill things on me while mixing up color into little bottles and
all that. So the only airbrush I have is the crudest model made by the Pache

14:07.140 --> 14:18.900
Airbrush Company, and that forces me to keep it to the background, pretty much.
I like to use it sometimes as a sketching tool. an airbrush wall develops soft

14:18.900 --> 14:27.640
masses of color in certain areas that have no hard edges so you can paint in and
out of those areas without creating distracting I don't know what the word would

14:27.640 --> 14:39.880
be, I call it background noise but distracting hard edges underneath what you're
painting on top I think it will be some time to come before I actually bring my

14:39.880 --> 14:48.060
airbrush work right up to the foreground and make a painting that's completely
airbrush My cover for Arthur C. Clarke's book, 2010, approaches that. There is a

14:48.060 --> 14:55.200
lot of airbrush work in the foreground there. But that was such a simple
composition that it pretty much required that, I think.

14:59.000 --> 15:10.680
What about using oils and acrylics? I know you prefer acrylics. Well, I prefer
acrylics for illustration because they dry so quickly. That's the only reason,

15:10.780 --> 15:19.400
really. Well, there's two reasons, actually, why I like to use acrylics. They
dry so quickly, and it's the main reason, and that's the reason why I first

15:19.400 --> 15:28.700
started using them. My training had all been in oils and watercolors, and a lot
of my early illustrations were in those two media, but I found myself often

15:28.700 --> 15:37.140
working at 3 o'clock in the morning before the day, or the morning of the day
that I had to turn a painting in, and I couldn't bring a painting in wet, so I'd

15:37.140 --> 15:45.080
have to make so much drier in with the painting. and there's a substance called
cobalt dryer that if you put too much in the paint, it seriously affects the

15:45.080 --> 15:55.600
longevity of the painting. In fact, I have a painting I did in late 1974 that
has now cracked up a lot in oil painting because I had to rush it dry that way.

15:56.680 --> 16:04.280
And so my feeling is if I can't paint an oil painting right so that it will last
and be a good investment to someone who may buy it, then I'd rather not use that

16:04.280 --> 16:16.640
medium at all unless I have the time to be able to develop it in the correct
process so that it'll last for posterity. So I use acrylics and it certainly is

16:16.640 --> 16:24.780
easier for me. I can paint right up to two minutes before the messenger comes to
pick up my painting and take it to the publisher and put in that last little

16:24.780 --> 16:34.900
highlight or whatever and not have to worry about it being wet or being damaged
on root. Some people say acrylics don't have the depth that oils have, but I had

16:34.900 --> 16:41.340
to notice the acrylic paints. Oh, it depends on how you use them. Yeah, I see a
lot of flat acrylic paintings, frankly.

16:44.220 --> 16:53.380
And that's just, I had to teach myself how to use them. And I think my
background in oils dictated that I try to duplicate some of the feeling that you

16:53.380 --> 17:03.400
get in oil paintings with acrylics. And maybe because I approach it from that
aspect, I attempted to do that, to get that feeling in depth with my acrylic set

17:03.400 --> 17:12.020
and other people who have just had a training in acrylics only don't try to do
that because they feel limited by that. The fast drying time is also a liability

17:12.020 --> 17:20.960
with acrylics. It's very hard to blend large areas of color, and that's why I
often resort to the airbrush. I can do it with watches if I have to, but it

17:20.960 --> 17:31.820
takes a lot longer. I did a painting for a book by Clifford Simak called City.
There's a big blue sky in the background, and it took me 32 washes of color to

17:31.820 --> 17:39.980
get just the right gradations of blues in the background. That took me about a
day and a half or two days to do. Now, with an airbrush, I probably could have

17:39.980 --> 17:49.980
gotten exactly the same effect in a half an hour. So, you know, when you're
working a 100-hour week or an 80-hour week like I do, you know, a half an hour

17:49.980 --> 17:57.820
can make a big difference in a painting. So I don't... I'm like... Wait a
minute, let me say... I don't work 80 or 100-hour weeks all the time, but I

17:57.820 --> 18:08.360
often do. It seems like most of the last year I did. That half an hour or two
days worth of time makes a big difference. I resort to the airbrush just because

18:08.360 --> 18:11.060
it is a good time-saving tool, and I can duplicate the same effects.

18:15.380 --> 18:27.220
I like oil paints a lot, and I want to get back into using them just because it
has a whole historical, romantic feeling to it. It's really something that's

18:27.220 --> 18:36.400
hard to describe to someone who's a non-artist, but the smell of turpentine in a
studio and everything has a certain sense of nostalgia and romance to it. It is

18:36.400 --> 18:46.680
an entirely enjoyable experience to paint in oils. It's a whole different thing
from working in acrylics. I would like to go back into painting with oils. I

18:46.680 --> 18:55.060
just have to give myself the time to do so. There is a problem I have with oils
which is the second reason why I use acrylics and that's that I develop skin

18:55.060 --> 19:04.320
problems when I get turpentine in contact with my skin, I seem to be allergic to
it. So I sometimes have to use gloves or whatever when I'm painting with oils,

19:04.360 --> 19:13.200
and that makes it a less enjoyable experience. I like to have the feeling of
actually holding the brush without the barrier of this rubber in between my hand

19:13.200 --> 19:17.560
and the brush. So that may be a reason why I haven't gotten back into painting
oils.

19:31.740 --> 19:45.960
I felt I felt really good about it but a little ambivalent I felt I felt like it
came a year too late because year before I done the White Dragon I had done the

19:45.960 --> 19:56.880
entire John Carter of Mars series. I felt it was the pinnacle of my work at that
time, and that's when I felt I really deserved to get it. A year after that, I

19:56.880 --> 20:07.140
still hadn't felt that I had bettered the work I'd done the year before, so I
didn't feel, you know, this often happens with Academy Awards, for example, that

20:07.140 --> 20:19.200
there'll be three excellent movies that deserve to get best picture but the
award can only go to one so they'll give it to one and uh they'll give an award

20:19.200 --> 20:27.720
to the same director or something three years down the pike for a lesser effort
but it's partially in in acknowledgement of what the the person did before that

20:27.720 --> 20:28.240
they didn't get the

20:31.760 --> 20:43.360
i've gotten what two or three more since then so um now it's uh you know it's
easy for me to be blase about it, and say, well, it's just an award, and it's

20:43.360 --> 20:52.400
great, but it doesn't pay the rent, and it doesn't do a thing for my income, or
whatever, but I'm not sure I would enjoy not getting one either, so I'm not

20:52.400 --> 21:04.920
going to say. Other artists will ask me, well, how does it feel to win another
Hugo, or whatever, and I'll go, well, it's all right, or it's nice, but again,

21:04.920 --> 21:16.060
it's easy for me to say that because I'm winning them, if I didn't win it it
would probably really bug me because I'm a competitive person there are times

21:16.060 --> 21:23.200
when I'm sitting down and I think wow there's X number of thousand people that
voted for me as the best artist that's really something that there's that many

21:23.200 --> 21:32.140
people that enjoy my work that much actually put my name down as the best artist
that they can think of that's really something that really gives me a boost

21:32.140 --> 21:34.040
sometimes But you can imagine.

21:38.080 --> 21:51.380
Here's a real art question. And I'm sure you ran into this. I have several
friends. Fantasy and space art. And they went on to get formal training in the

21:51.380 --> 22:00.840
arts. And they draw what was required in class. But when they went through what
they wanted to draw, the instructors got a little strange. Did you run into

22:00.840 --> 22:11.840
that? you run into it all the time it's getting worse if not better I mean it's
it's getting worse if it's not the same there's only one school I'm an art

22:11.840 --> 22:23.440
school I can think of that has opened up their attitudes towards that since um
you know since say 1972 now there could very well be others but I know the Paris

22:23.440 --> 22:34.240
School of Art in in Connecticut has changed their attitudes a little bit as a
result of Don Mates who is one of their major graduates and who is a Hugo

22:34.240 --> 22:47.780
nominee now they have a little bit more of a tolerant attitude towards science
fiction or fantasy art. Unfortunately you'll find a snobby attitude towards

22:47.780 --> 22:59.040
fantasy and science fiction art among the public in general it's just nearly
impossible for anyone who does the type of work I do to get into galleries to

22:59.040 --> 23:08.220
get any kind of critical recognition at all. And it's only in the last few years
that it's starting to show any hope. Unfortunately, the art schools, as usual,

23:08.280 --> 23:20.200
are years behind the real world. And even if they started showing fantasy and
science fiction work in major museums and galleries on a regular basis, it's

23:20.200 --> 23:28.280
going to be a long time until the art schools, I think, catch up and start
showing a better attitude towards it. But this is something I ran into. that's

23:28.280 --> 23:37.100
one of the reasons why I dropped out so quickly from ArtCenter there's an
instance where that I can relate, there was a class I had, a figure drawing

23:37.100 --> 23:45.860
class and the teacher was late, hadn't come in yet and the model was just
standing there and I had my drawing pad in front of me and the model was dressed

23:45.860 --> 23:55.820
up in an 1890s type of get up and he had a bicycle pump that was his prop and he
was just standing there in this ridiculous pose that I had no interest in I

23:55.820 --> 24:04.820
couldn't see any reason why I should have to draw that I knew that I could draw
it if I wanted to. You know, I graduated already with a BA degree in painting at

24:04.820 --> 24:13.880
San Jose State University. I'm capable. I could draw that figure without having
the figure in front of me. It was no problem. And so I just ignored him standing

24:13.880 --> 24:22.700
there and started drawing this picture of a giant, well, he was a big, bald
giant standing on a mountaintop, a very heroic type of pose. The teacher came

24:22.700 --> 24:31.900
in, looked over my shoulder and said, What is that? And then proceeded to scold
me and give me all kinds of verbal abuse about refusing to draw what was in

24:31.900 --> 24:42.240
front of me. And I just packed up my things and said, that's it. What am I here
for? This is ridiculous. I'm not being taught anything. By being forced to draw

24:42.240 --> 24:54.700
something that I have no interest in, that I could learn nothing from. So, you
know, you find this in art schools all the time. And there's also the situation

24:54.700 --> 25:06.620
where you have instructors who don't know how to teach how to draw realistic
art. One thing that I see all the time, I have art students corresponding with

25:06.620 --> 25:14.880
me. Art students have come to conventions to see me and talk to me. Where can I
go to find out how to draw a person? Where can I go to find out how to render

25:14.880 --> 25:24.560
something the way it looks in real life? because all they're getting are classes
in abstract painting, how to express your feelings. You can't express your

25:24.560 --> 25:33.220
feelings unless you have a vocabulary. And if you've got to learn the
vocabulary, the fundamentals, first. If you decide to cast those aside, then

25:33.220 --> 25:44.700
fine. But first, you've got to have a grounding in the academic training. After
all, even Picasso did that. He was an incredible academy painter. He could

25:44.700 --> 25:53.680
render human figures with remarkable verity. first, but then he decided to go
into more abstract expression. Fine. But you've got to have that grounding

25:53.680 --> 26:03.940
first. I don't think, well, anyway, this is a pet peeve of mine. I see this
happening time and time again where a school will graduate a number of students

26:03.940 --> 26:15.240
who are unable to make a living commercially as an artist, either doing
portraits or commissions or in the commercial field because they're simply not

26:15.240 --> 26:23.220
skilled and don't have the mental makeup to be able to do it so they end up
being teachers. And what do they teach? The same thing that they paint. And so

26:23.220 --> 26:32.060
it's just a self-promoting system and it gets worse and worse and worse as the
years go on. You get more and more incompetent people. And they graduate people

26:32.060 --> 26:40.760
who can't make a living out in the real world, quote, unquote, and they go back
and teach as a way of living and they teach more incompetent people. And the

26:40.760 --> 26:47.580
poor students are the ones who are suffering because they go to a school
trusting the school to teach them what they need to know to be able to paint

26:47.580 --> 26:57.820
properly or express what they want to express, and they're not getting the
education. I had a strong feeling that you knew you were in engineering. Yes, I

26:57.820 --> 27:08.380
had been. And I waited two and a half years at San Jose State University until I
finally started getting classes from what I consider to be decent instructors. I

27:08.380 --> 27:17.680
don't know why schools don't require their art teachers to have portfolios
available for viewing by students before they sign up for the class. You can

27:17.680 --> 27:24.560
tell by looking at a teacher's portfolio what the teacher's attitude is. In
fact, even if there's a little resume, that would help too. What the teacher's

27:24.560 --> 27:35.280
attitude is towards art, what the teacher's viewpoints are, you know, etc. Then
you could pick an instructor who has the possibility of teaching you what you

27:35.280 --> 27:42.640
want to learn. but it's ridiculous if you want to be a nature painter, for
example, and paint natural, paint animals and whatever in a realistic manner.

27:42.800 --> 27:55.640
Take a class from someone who teaches abstract expressionism. It's useless. It's
a waste of money. It's a waste of time. Absolutely pointless. Good art is, well,

27:55.780 --> 28:05.320
I can get in my whole spiel about abstract art anyway. There is no such thing as
abstract. I mean, good art that is not good abstract art to begin with. that's a

28:05.320 --> 28:17.060
whole point by Whistler's mother it's an abstract painting the actual name or
title of that painting is an arrangement in blacks and grays is the actual title

28:17.060 --> 28:29.720
of the painting and every good painting is a good abstract painting it's just
that someone who works realistically or works in a way that gives you a feeling

28:29.720 --> 28:36.960
that he's painting reality is taking it one step beyond the abstract. Whereas an
abstract painter will leave it at that point and not carry it any further.

28:41.180 --> 28:46.620
Let's... Would you give me... Sure. Sure. I'm sorry. I'm getting... No problem
there. I'll climb off my soapbox here for a second.

28:49.760 --> 29:02.460
What? Aside from fantasy in general, what are your favorite subjects? If you're
not painting a cover... I think one thing that you can say about my work is I

29:02.460 --> 29:12.400
try to cover all the all the fields and that's because it's all I don't have any
any particular favorite I've I think I could say I have a favorite assignment

29:12.400 --> 29:20.300
each year there's an there's one assignment I get every year that is the one I
look forward to it's a it's a regular thing now with Dawe books and that's the

29:20.300 --> 29:30.740
year's best horror stories cover it's a collection of horror stories supposedly
the year's best and um I have completely free rain like I often do with book

29:30.740 --> 29:41.380
covers but especially with this one and that's enjoyable to me. I like doing a
good horror painting once in a while. I'm not a person who's interested at all

29:41.380 --> 29:51.080
in blood and guts. That's not necessarily what I I equate that more with
revulsion than I do with horror. There's a difference but that is a lot of fun

29:51.080 --> 30:01.000
and I've enjoyed doing that cover every year that painting I should say. I've
come up with a few pretty scary ideas that that's never let me paint someday

30:01.000 --> 30:08.740
that I'll do just for myself. But, you know, that's only one aspect. I like, of
course, the other aspects of science fiction and fantasy also. I like to paint.

30:09.600 --> 30:17.300
I like the exploration of space, what they call hardware paintings with
spaceships and all that. That's a lot of fun. I like to just kind of keep my

30:17.300 --> 30:25.800
fingers in all of it. So I can't really say I have a, especially having a
favorite, you know, field. Or as one of them and that particular job is probably

30:25.800 --> 30:36.300
my favorite assignment out of the year but I can't say it's doing horror is
something I like to do over doing other things per se

30:44.700 --> 30:57.800
question from one of the other guys um how much does a cover affect the
saleability or popularity of the book do you get any feedback on that well can I

30:57.800 --> 31:09.400
cover full of books? I honestly don't know. I really don't know. Sometimes I
think it makes a big difference, other times I don't. The fact that my career

31:09.400 --> 31:10.740
has gone where it has and that

31:13.880 --> 31:22.500
sometimes I think it makes a big difference. The fact that I'm getting paid what
I do and everything to do these covers and that the publishers seem to think

31:22.500 --> 31:24.260
that my work sells books

31:27.100 --> 31:35.180
over just the title and the name of the author makes me think sometimes that the
artwork has a lot to do with it. There are other times when you'll see a

31:35.180 --> 31:44.560
bestseller that has an absolutely wretched cover or has nothing but type on it
that's selling quite well then you think the cover art has absolutely nothing to

31:44.560 --> 31:57.320
do with it. So it's really hard to say. It's a balance I think between how
famous the author is how much publicity the book has gotten and the expectations

31:57.320 --> 32:08.560
that people have had before the book's been published. A book like Foundation's
Edge, the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov has a large readership. They've been

32:08.560 --> 32:17.940
waiting for this book, and it's come out. They could have put a black cover with
just the title Foundation's Edge on it, and that thing would have sold off the

32:17.940 --> 32:23.640
shelf. but just to be sure they've hired me to do the paperback cover for that
book, but, you know,

32:26.860 --> 32:39.740
books that have large, very large, that are published in large publications have
large budgets, and so they can afford to have a good cover for that, and I think

32:39.740 --> 32:50.540
that's why it's true as, what's his name? The founder of Dell. His last name was
Dell Acord. I don't remember his first name. Anyway, he said, what you do is

32:51.500 --> 33:02.360
when you have a good painter, good cover artist, is use them for your best books
or your worst books. That way you cover both your bases. But he especially

33:02.360 --> 33:10.860
accented the idea of using your best cover artist for your worst books because
then at least you minimize your losses. Everything on top of that is gravy. and

33:10.860 --> 33:21.680
so I don't know I asked one publisher if that was true and she said yes we'll
put you on our worst books and on our best books and if you can't tell the

33:21.680 --> 33:29.500
difference that's fine with us but if you can that's her attitude and I guess
that's good because that way I get to read some good ones lately they've all

33:29.500 --> 33:40.160
been really great books I haven't had any clinkers I've heard before in the
interview You put it, whether, let's say an editor's in there and they're

33:40.160 --> 33:47.280
reading this, and you're like, oh boy, you've got to buy this from this guy
because you said we would, and now we're stuck with it. Get Walen in here and

33:47.280 --> 33:56.840
have him discover. Yeah, that's happened many times, and in fact I don't want to
name names, so I can't. I won't on this particular instance because the writer

33:56.840 --> 34:08.580
is someone that I really like, and most of the work that this writer has done is
excellent. But this particular piece was a real loser. Yeah, I shouldn't have

34:08.580 --> 34:17.660
said what I said just a minute ago, that I haven't had many clinkers lately.
This was a real clinker, and I did the cover within the last three months, and

34:17.660 --> 34:26.780
the painting was not one of my best. I'm proud of it, but I wouldn't put it up
there with the White Dragon. I'll put it that way. And I think my attitude

34:26.780 --> 34:35.040
towards doing the cover was directly derived from the lack of quality in the
book and my disappointment with the book, and that does happen sometimes,

34:35.040 --> 34:48.060
unfortunately, in spite of myself. In your opinion, is science fiction and
fantasy art getting better, staying the same? Oh, it's definitely getting

34:48.060 --> 34:56.700
better, getting better all the time, and despite my gloomy feelings about art
schools and all that, the recognition for science fiction and fantasy art is

34:56.700 --> 35:12.600
starting to swing upwards. I've had one-man shows in a few museums, and I've
been part of group shows in some museums up north and in the east. And there's

35:12.600 --> 35:21.860
talk now among people in the Smithsonian, among other institutions, of having
major science fiction-oriented art shows. If this starts happening and we get

35:21.860 --> 35:32.580
this much-needed critical appraisal, which is the main problem with science
fiction art, so that there is no critiquing being done of it. Then I think we'll

35:32.580 --> 35:42.240
start to get some recognition. We'll get more critiques. Then we'll get
investors interested in it and the prices will come up and it will reach a level

35:42.240 --> 35:53.180
of respectability comparable with, say, Western art. Right now, old fantasy art,
the work of Maxwell Parish, Arthur Rackham, people like that, is fairly highly

35:53.180 --> 36:04.160
respected and commands decent prices, I would imagine, but new work is done at
the bottom of the scale, and it's going to take some time. The same thing was

36:04.160 --> 36:14.800
true of science fiction literature. It was always in the ghetto, so to speak, as
the writers often would say. What's out of the ghetto now? The literature is a

36:14.800 --> 36:24.700
commanding force on the bestseller list. The New York Times bestseller list has
over half the items are now so-called genre items either horror science fiction

36:24.700 --> 36:33.960
or fantasy books commanding the bestseller list it's out of the ghetto now it's
getting critical appraisal and and some recognition as an art form in in the

36:33.960 --> 36:41.820
literature field it's time now for the art to do the same thing and and i don't
think it'll be much longer till it does it'll just require some uh extraordinary

36:41.820 --> 36:51.660
efforts on the part of the artist to get to go out and publicize it to show it
to the public I have to say, whenever I've had a one-man show or been part of a

36:51.660 --> 37:00.740
group show of science fiction and fantasy records, we have not had a show yet in
a museum or gallery that has not broken all attendance records for previous

37:00.740 --> 37:10.060
shows in that gallery. It happened at the New Britain Museum of Art. It happened
in the Canton, Ohio Museum of Art. It happened in the Butler Museum of Art. They

37:10.060 --> 37:18.180
put in a science fiction or fantasy show and it broke all attendance records for
that particular museum. So there's an incredible support for this type of art

37:18.180 --> 37:26.000
among the general public. It's just going to take the snob some time to realize
that and to realize that there is some good art in there worthy of notice and

37:26.000 --> 37:37.200
critical appraisal. It's all tied together. Until the critics deign to look and
say some of this is good art and start spelling out what is good and what isn't,

37:37.340 --> 37:41.280
then it's not going to be considered seriously by the people who invest in the
art.

37:46.980 --> 37:54.300
I've got to say that that is something that I'm really disappointed in is that
there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of

37:57.260 --> 38:04.900
we need people to who are willing to put their reputations on the line and say
this art is good and this person's art is not good

38:07.660 --> 38:17.060
you know being a self supported group of people in science fiction and the
fantasy community. Everyone is mutually supportive and everyone tries to be

38:17.060 --> 38:19.280
democratic, but that's not the way the real world works.

38:22.680 --> 38:31.900
if you have an art show that has several excellent pieces of work in it and
several bad things that the majority of people are going to look at and say,

38:32.100 --> 38:40.700
that's terrible. What's that doing in this show? People aren't going to take it
very seriously because they're going to feel that But science fiction art is

38:40.700 --> 38:49.760
basically anything that's weird or grotesque and that there's no standards for
quality in the field. There are some people attempting to form an academy of

38:49.760 --> 39:04.200
science fiction and fantasy art, and this may help a lot in establishing a basis
for standards. Well, not standards. I'm not trying to get that across. A basis

39:04.200 --> 39:16.680
for quality. You know, for example, good rendering, you know, and basic things
that make a piece of art good. There's not quite a place to come from it. Very

39:16.680 --> 39:25.920
little. I mean, what we have is, let's look at the Western artists. You know,
the Western art has a heritage, a heritage going back to Remington and other

39:25.920 --> 39:38.960
artists from back then. it's got a standard of quality a benchmark with
Remington and other artists for people to aspire to or to try to better even if

39:38.960 --> 39:45.940
their styles are more modern or whatever it does have that what does science
fiction and fantasy art have well it's got the art of the pulps from the 30s and

39:45.940 --> 39:55.360
that's about it most of that art was real dreck let's face it when people look
at it even among the general public it's considered pretty terrible art and a

39:55.360 --> 40:04.400
lot of it was some of it was excellent there was some excellent art from back
then also but there was a lot of terrible work and there have even been books

40:04.400 --> 40:12.440
published of the art of the pulps and everything and this is what people see in
the bookstores and they think science fiction art they think of the old you know

40:12.440 --> 40:21.980
the women in the brass brassiere fighting the tentacled monster you know in the
cliche situations and with a bubble helmet and everything hopefully Star Wars

40:21.980 --> 40:30.220
and some of the new movies have been out in the last 10 years. We'll start to
change that image and if people become more aware of the art on the books also,

40:30.380 --> 40:45.640
that'll change also. But we're still fighting to overcome the bad taste left
over from the art of the 30s and 40s. The pull part. Have you had any inquiries

40:45.640 --> 41:02.140
into doing production design like Ralph McQuarrie? Yes. Yes, I've even got an
agent now in Hollywood who's fielding those for me. I've had a few real weirdos

41:02.140 --> 41:11.420
come up to me with these great movie proposals, and I've wasted so much time
dealing with these people that I've had to finally get an agent to handle some

41:11.420 --> 41:22.100
of those. I am working on a movie project now that may develop into a full-scale
production. I don't know. We'll see. that I can't talk about, is what I'm

41:22.100 --> 41:31.560
getting into. I've signed a paper to the effect that I can't reveal any of the
information about the movie until they choose to do so in a publicity release.

41:31.820 --> 41:45.100
What are you working on that you can't do? Cover. Oh, that I can talk about? I
just finished the cover for Foundation's Edge for Isik Asimov. There's a new

41:45.100 --> 41:55.700
dragon book by Anne McCaffrey that I'll start reading soon. I've got another
Year's Best Horror Stories cover to do next month, or this month actually. April

41:55.700 --> 41:57.280
anyway. What month are we in here?

42:00.740 --> 42:10.680
There are so many things going on. It's really hard for me to remember them all.
There's the Final Fuzzy Manuscript by H.P. Lovecraft, I was going to say. H.P.

42:10.740 --> 42:23.300
and Piper. I am wrapping up a children's book, my first children's book. So
that's a collaboration with another artist named David Wenzel, and it should be

42:23.300 --> 42:27.340
a real nice book. And let me think, we're doing...

42:29.520 --> 42:37.180
I'll tell you the truth. I've got a stack of manuscripts in my studio that's
probably five feet high. And they come in, and I say, well, that looks like a

42:37.180 --> 42:44.580
fun one to do. And yeah, I can fit in my schedule, and then I put it in the pile
and forget about it until I get done with the painting before that one is due

42:44.580 --> 42:52.760
and pick up the manuscript and say, oh yeah, this one. So I've forgotten what a
lot of my projects are. I've not booked as much as a year in advance at any

42:52.760 --> 43:04.880
particular time and that certainly is the situation now. So I remember, there's
some of them that I remember and those are the ongoing projects and the Dragon

43:04.880 --> 43:11.160
one because I've got a special interest in Emma Caffrey's work. but that's

43:11.160 --> 43:12.560
all I can think of off the top of my head.

43:15.440 --> 43:23.280
How many projects do you have going at one time, paintings with? Well, I usually
like to keep it to just one. I hate to divide my interests between one painting

43:23.280 --> 43:33.060
and another project. I go to great lengths to maintain a mood throughout a
painting. I did a painting that took place on a sandy planet, for example, it

43:33.060 --> 43:44.040
was all desert. and I recorded a six hour tape of all wind noises and like wind
in a desert and I just played that while I was painting the painting because I

43:44.040 --> 43:53.960
wanted to keep in the mood and the feeling of that that book and that that
painting so I hate I'd hate to be in the middle of that planet and that scene

43:53.960 --> 44:03.580
and trying to develop that this environment and then have to break it and do a
painting of something horrible or whatever. But sometimes I'm forced to. And

44:03.580 --> 44:14.160
it's happened a couple times. But I'm usually good enough at juggling my
schedule around so I don't have to. It is very beneficial sometimes to have a

44:14.160 --> 44:21.800
break after doing all the sketches. I've sent the sketches in to the publisher
and they're looking those over for me to do another project because when the

44:21.800 --> 44:29.340
sketches come back to me, I see them with a fresh eye. And even though the
publisher may have picked one particular one I may find a different one that I

44:29.340 --> 44:35.820
think it really is better for the book after all and I'll throw the other ones
aside I'll talk it over to the publisher and we'll figure out a way to

44:35.820 --> 44:39.780
compromise on them or something or they'll let me go ahead and do the one I want
to do

44:43.280 --> 44:55.900
but that is good to have a break between doing going through all the analyzing
the collating and excuse me and doing the sketches and and before doing the

44:55.900 --> 45:03.440
final painting is could have a break in there but while I'm actually doing that
the big painting the big rendering I hate hate to have to break that and do

45:03.440 --> 45:14.400
another one it's really that's one of the reasons why I have a strong dislike
for advertising work advertising work always involves having to do extra work on

45:14.400 --> 45:20.440
a painting you know you do a piece it's the only time that ever happens to me
never happens to me with paperback covers I get something sent back to me for

45:20.440 --> 45:29.620
changes but I'll do an advertising job and because well advertising jobs are
almost always judged by committee you know men in the advertising company and

45:29.620 --> 45:36.480
someone always has to come up with an idea that makes it sound like he's worth
being hired to work in this company so if a piece of artwork gets passed around

45:36.480 --> 45:43.700
for a particular client they'll look at it and say well I think this and
everyone's got to have an idea you know and some of the ideas are the most

45:43.700 --> 45:52.020
stupid things I've ever heard in my life I'll tell you working for advertising
companies are really something and And they'll think of anything to have some

45:52.020 --> 45:58.440
input in this particular committee meeting about my piece of work or any
artist's piece of work. I don't know any artist that doesn't have things sent

45:58.440 --> 46:07.820
back from advertising agencies and stuff on a regular basis. And so I'll be
working. I will finish the painting, send it into an ad company or whatever. And

46:07.820 --> 46:16.520
I'll be on the next one. And then this thing will come back to me because I want
changes here or brighten up this or take this out or whatever. Then I'll have to

46:16.520 --> 46:23.960
stop and work on that other one. make the changes and send that back in and then
I can go back to the painting I was working on and I hate that so much, that's

46:23.960 --> 46:32.540
why I avoid doing a lot of advertising jobs I mean I charge them for the extra
work and all that and that type that kind of discourages them from sending it

46:32.540 --> 46:44.260
back to me but a lot of times it doesn't Let's get into Glass Onion Graphics a
little bit why did you decide to open that up?

46:48.180 --> 47:00.380
it was a gradual process I'd always wanted to make prints of my work available
most of my work sells for pretty high prices fans simply can't afford it when I

47:00.380 --> 47:10.820
go to a convention I like to have something they can afford to buy the way
around that is by doing prints and posters of my work Glassning Graphics was

47:10.820 --> 47:22.860
created to fill that need Now, my wife has helped me out a lot by doing my
bookkeeping, for example, and other things. She stopped doing what she was doing

47:22.860 --> 47:30.020
in order to help me out in my business to a certain extent. And Glass-Siner
Graphics was kind of an extension of that. I said, if you want to go ahead and

47:30.020 --> 47:37.880
make a print of my work, I'd be really happy. You can take all the profit and
everything. Just, you know, as long as we have print available for fans to buy

47:37.880 --> 47:44.560
or whatever. And she's turned it into a full-scale business. Now, she's still
busy. She's on that phone. She's doing my bookkeeping and all this other stuff

47:44.560 --> 47:54.540
that we originally were going to – she was going to do. We've had to hire extra
people. We have a secretary and whatever. But now it's going into a full-scale

47:54.540 --> 47:55.020
business.
