Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.780
And here are your hosts.

00:41.720 --> 00:49.080
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Michael Whelan. He has to be recognized as
the hottest artist going in the science fiction and fantasy field. In the fall

00:49.080 --> 00:56.340
of 1983, he won the latest of several Hugos he's garnered as the best artist
doing science fiction and fantasy work. We spoke with Whelan recently and asked

00:56.340 --> 01:07.660
him when his interest in science fiction and fantasy art began. I think it
developed when I was born. My father's always worked in the space industry or in

01:07.660 --> 01:17.460
the missiles and space industry. So I had that input around me. He had always
been reading science fiction since I was young. So I had the magazines around to

01:17.460 --> 01:27.960
look at. Some of my earliest recollections are of looking at the covers of old
amazing stories, magazines, or paperback books. In fact, some of them influenced

01:27.960 --> 01:37.400
me to a great deal. Before I could even read or write, I remember looking at
some of those covers for hours and absorbing the visual feeling of the

01:37.400 --> 01:48.060
paintings. There were a few that were especially captivating for me. And I
remember them to this day, exactly what the paintings look like. And I could

01:48.060 --> 01:55.740
describe to you the compositions and some of the colors of the paintings. And
it's a funny thing. At the last World Science Fiction Convention, I was walking

01:55.740 --> 02:04.660
down by one of the dealer's tables in the dealer's room. And I just started
going through some of the paperback books. And I saw one of the covers that I

02:04.660 --> 02:14.020
remembered from when I was three years old or whatever. It was interesting to me
because I hadn't been able, in retrospect, to pinpoint the exact time when I

02:14.020 --> 02:23.080
started really being fascinated by science fiction imagery. And this book had
been published in 1952 or 1953. So being born in 1950, that pretty much

02:23.080 --> 02:35.140
establishes the beginning of that at around three years old or so. But the fact
that it meant so much to me that I remembered that exact cover until my present

02:35.140 --> 02:46.340
age says something about how I guess it was just a part of me that that kind of
imagery was important to me. But later when I began to read, I became an avid

02:46.340 --> 02:55.540
reader of all types of literature, but especially science fiction and fantasy.
And I had an interest in art, so the two combined. And it seemed natural to me

02:55.540 --> 03:04.220
to read and try to draw what I read. And I would come home sometimes from
science fiction movies or movies that I enjoyed and try to illustrate scenes

03:04.220 --> 03:10.180
that I'd seen in the movie from memory. And that carried on pretty much right
into my college years.

03:20.980 --> 03:33.780
In college, Whelan had no plans on becoming an artist. He was, in fact, a pre
-med student. In college, I had been laboring under the assumption that I had to

03:33.780 --> 03:42.860
have a real type of profession. This is largely due to input from my parents,
but I felt that I had to. To be something professional like a lawyer, something

03:42.860 --> 03:45.760
respectable, which being an artist isn't.

03:48.440 --> 03:56.980
So I was diverted during my college years into wanting to become a doctor, which
is still a major interest of mine. Anatomy and physiology and the sciences in

03:56.980 --> 04:07.200
general were always important to me. But about three quarters of the way through
my college education, I decided to abandon my pre-med training and go full

04:07.200 --> 04:15.240
scale. Well, actually, it wasn't until my last year of college that I decided
full tilt to go into illustrating or painting. And I graduated with a degree in

04:15.240 --> 04:24.060
painting. If I had taken one more course, I would have had a degree in biology
with an emphasis on anatomy and physiology, human anatomy and physiology. Whelan

04:24.060 --> 04:33.740
pays special attention to the human form in his art. There's a reason for that.
One of the jobs I had when I was putting myself through college was working in

04:33.740 --> 04:41.320
the anatomy and physiology labs at the university I went to preparing the
cadavers for the classes. And during that time, I managed to get some work in

04:41.320 --> 04:50.860
doing medical illustrations. All this combined to really give me a good
fundamental education in the way the body is made up. More next time with

04:50.860 --> 04:51.520
Michael Whelan.

04:58.620 --> 05:06.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:06.520 --> 05:07.260
Odessa, Texas.

05:53.900 --> 05:57.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.160
And here are your hosts.

06:27.260 --> 06:33.980
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Hugo Award-winning artist Michael Whelan
has always been a reader of science fiction and fantasy. His love of the field

06:33.980 --> 06:41.240
inspires his work. Among other things, Whelan paints covers for science fiction
and fantasy books. He's the most successful artist in his field right now, and

06:41.240 --> 06:47.540
if you read any science fiction at all, you've seen and admired one of his
covers. How does Whelan come up with an idea for a book cover? Say for his well

06:47.540 --> 06:56.620
-known painting on Anne McCaffrey's The White Dragon. That's going back away. That's
back in 77 or 78 when I did that. Let me think. Well, I read the book one time,

06:56.800 --> 07:11.320
just read it as a reader, so to speak. Then I go through it again the second
time as an illustrator, making notes and margins about details of the way people

07:11.320 --> 07:21.400
and objects and things look, making sure that I try to catch all the details so
I don't make someone who's blonde, black-haired or whatever, you know, because I

07:21.400 --> 07:30.500
like to be really true to the story as much as possible, especially if I'm
taking a narrative approach to doing an illustration. After going through it

07:30.500 --> 07:40.780
that second time, I'll sit down and start to develop thumbnail sketches, which
are just small drawings on scrap paper, actually, and try to find an idea of

07:40.780 --> 07:49.760
what I would like to illustrate from that book. There's usually something in any
book, no matter how bad or good, that will make a good painting. It's a matter

07:49.760 --> 08:00.320
of digging through it and finding what it leads to you and what will motivate
you to do a really good job. So I go through it and try to collate all my

08:00.320 --> 08:08.280
different ideas and put it together into a painting. That is the mysterious part
that I can't really describe to you, how that happens. I guess that's what makes

08:08.280 --> 08:19.140
me what I am, is that process there of distilling what I've read into something
that's a visual image that captures what's in the book. But that process takes a

08:19.140 --> 08:31.760
few days to do, and sometimes I get an instant image. The cover I just did for
Robert A. Heinlein's book, Friday, I had an instantaneous concept of what that

08:31.760 --> 08:40.120
cover was going to look like. As soon as I finished reading the book the first
time, I had, I think, a perfectly clear idea of what Friday looked like. And I

08:40.120 --> 08:50.500
knew that the cover to this book had to be a portrait of this character, because
the character had such, well, she had such personality that the book was written

08:50.500 --> 08:51.780
around her personality, I think.

09:02.660 --> 09:11.800
And if he ever gets any feedback from authors whose book covers he's done. Yes,
lots of times. In fact, with Friday, I got a phone call from Robert A. Heinlein

09:11.800 --> 09:22.180
about a couple months after I turned in the painting to Ballantine Del Rey. They
sent him a cover proof, which is a first-run color tryout of what the cover's

09:22.180 --> 09:30.780
going to look like. And he called me up to tell me it was the, it was a little
flattery, I guess. He told me it was the best cover he ever had on a book of

09:30.780 --> 09:38.860
his, which is really quite a statement for someone who's been in the field as
long as he has. And to have an author tell me that I've captured a particular

09:38.860 --> 09:48.440
character or scene exactly the way they had it in mind is probably, for me, the
highest praise that an illustrator can get. And that really had me floating up

09:48.440 --> 09:56.200
by the ceiling for a couple weeks to think that he would bother to call me to
tell me that. But sometimes before I do a painting, I'll correspond with an

09:56.200 --> 10:06.840
author or talk to him or her on the phone to establish certain details. With the
white dragon, for example, I talked to Anne McCaffrey at length about the actual

10:06.840 --> 10:15.900
details of the dragons as she saw the dragons in her book, whether they had
forked tails or tails that ended in a point or whatever, or a barb or whatever,

10:16.120 --> 10:24.780
and what their skin was like and what the texture was so that I could try to
capture her image of what they look like. It's kind of silly for someone who's

10:24.780 --> 10:31.600
an illustrator to try to make all that up when you can contact the author and
get the details, if they're not in the book, straight from the person who

10:31.600 --> 10:35.720
thought them up. We'll continue our conversation with Michael Whelan on our next
show.

10:43.140 --> 10:50.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:50.960 --> 10:51.700
Odessa, Texas.

11:40.280 --> 11:44.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:59.880 --> 12:05.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.540
And here are your hosts.

12:13.520 --> 12:20.040
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Multiple award-winning science fiction
artist Michael Whelan has done the cover art on many of the blockbusters in the

12:20.040 --> 12:26.840
science fiction and fantasy field recently. The cover painting for Anne
McCaffrey's The White Dragon was probably his first well-known cover. Since then

12:26.840 --> 12:34.820
he's done the art for Arthur Clarke's 2010: Odyssey Two, Robert Heinlein's Friday,
and Isaac Asimov's Foundation's Edge. We asked Whelan if he has a favorite type

12:34.820 --> 12:44.680
of subject for his paintings. I think one thing that you can say about my work
is that I try to cover all the fields. And that's because it's all, I don't have

12:44.680 --> 12:54.120
any particular favorite. I think I could say I have a favorite assignment each
year. There's one assignment I get every year that's the one I look forward to.

12:54.340 --> 13:01.400
It's a regular thing now with DAW books, and that's the year's best horror
stories cover. It's a collection of horror stories, supposedly the year's best.

13:03.660 --> 13:08.640
And I have completely free reign, like I often do with book covers, but
especially with this one.

13:11.620 --> 13:18.660
And that's enjoyable to me. I like doing a good horror painting once in a while.
I'm not a person who's interested at all in blood and guts. That's not

13:18.660 --> 13:28.520
necessarily what I, I equate that more with revulsion than I do with horror.
There's a difference. But that is a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed doing that

13:28.520 --> 13:37.760
cover every year, that painting, I should say. I've come up with a few pretty
scary ideas that they've never let me paint, too. Someday that I'll do just for

13:37.760 --> 13:46.260
myself. But, you know, that's only one aspect. I like, of course, the other
aspects of science fiction and fantasy. Also, I like to paint. I like the

13:46.260 --> 13:53.780
exploration of space, what they call hardware paintings with spaceships and all
that. That's a lot of fun. I like to just kind of keep my fingers in all of it.

13:53.860 --> 14:01.820
So I can't really say I have a, especially having a favorite, you know, field.
Horror is one of them, and that particular job is probably my favorite

14:01.820 --> 14:12.620
assignment out of the year. But I can't say it's doing horror is something I
like to do over doing other things. We've all seen the gaudy and attention

14:12.620 --> 14:19.060
-getting covers in science fiction and fantasy books. Maybe you've even been
influenced to buy a book because of its cover. We asked Whelan if a cover can

14:19.060 --> 14:30.120
sell a science fiction book. I honestly don't know. I really don't know.
Sometimes I think it makes a big difference. Other times I don't. You know, the

14:30.120 --> 14:36.500
fact that my career has gone where it has and that sometimes

14:36.500 --> 14:45.660
I think it makes a big difference. The fact that I'm getting paid what I do and
everything to do these covers and that the publishers seem to think that my work

14:45.660 --> 14:49.600
sells books over

14:49.600 --> 14:57.140
just the title and the name of the author makes me think sometimes that the
artwork has a lot to do with that. There are other times when you'll see a

14:57.140 --> 15:06.220
bestseller that has an absolutely wretched cover or has nothing but type on it
that's selling quite well. Then you think the cover art has absolutely nothing

15:06.220 --> 15:15.840
to do with it. So it's really hard to say. It's a balance, I think, between how
famous the author is, how much publicity the book has gotten, and the

15:15.840 --> 15:19.080
expectations

15:19.080 --> 15:30.240
that people have had before the book's been published. A book like Foundation's
Edge, the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov has a large readership. They've been

15:30.240 --> 15:38.380
waiting for this book and it's come out. So, you know, they could have put a
black cover with just the title Foundation's Edge on it and that thing would

15:38.380 --> 15:45.160
have sold, you know, off the shelf. But just to be sure, they've hired me to do
the paperback cover for that book. But, you know,

15:48.580 --> 16:01.080
books that have large, very large, that are published in large publications have
large budgets. And so they can afford to have a good cover for that. And I think

16:01.080 --> 16:10.880
that's why it's true as, let's see, what's his name? The founder of Dell. His
last name is Dell Accord. I don't remember his first name. Anyway, he said, what

16:10.880 --> 16:21.320
you do is, when you have a good painter, good cover artist, is use them for your
best books or your worst books. As the top cover artist working today, Whelan

16:21.320 --> 16:22.380
gets a lot of both types.

16:29.600 --> 16:37.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:37.500 --> 16:38.260
Odessa, Texas.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:49.140 --> 17:54.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.800
And here are your hosts.

18:02.740 --> 18:09.580
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Richard Curtis is a New York literary
agent who represents a number of today's most popular science fiction authors.

18:09.860 --> 18:17.160
He also writes a column for Locus Magazine, the best-known publication in the
science fiction and fantasy field. The column is called Agent's Corner, and it's

18:17.160 --> 18:26.640
full of advice for any kind of author, not just science fiction and fantasy
writers. We asked Curtis about the origin of his column. Well, about two and a

18:26.640 --> 18:42.700
half years ago, I was invited to address a group of authors, the American
Society of Journalists and Authors. And I chose to talk to them about certain

18:42.700 --> 18:55.740
contractual clauses that I thought might be pitfalls for most professional
authors. In the questioning that followed, I found an appalling ignorance on the

18:55.740 --> 19:09.500
part of authors on the subject of contracts. And many of these people are highly
respected professional journalists and book authors. And yet it was clear to me

19:09.500 --> 19:21.160
that they didn't know anything, or very much, I should say, about how to read a
contract, how to negotiate one, and how to alter a clause to their own benefit.

19:21.160 --> 19:32.940
And so I decided to write a column for the many other writers who were probably
on the same position. And I asked Charles Brown, the editor of Locus, the

19:32.940 --> 19:46.980
publisher of Locus, I guess, whether he'd be interested in publishing it. And he
was quite agreeable. And thereafter, a number of magazines, newsletters

19:46.980 --> 19:59.800
published by other writers groups, such as Western Writers of America, Romance
Writers of America, Mystery Writers of America, took on the column because they

19:59.800 --> 20:08.340
felt their authors were in the same position. We asked Curtis if he would mind
telling us some of the science fiction authors he represents. Well, no, I don't

20:08.340 --> 20:22.360
mind at all. It's, I think, a fairly common knowledge in the science fiction
community. We represent Harlan Ellison, Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, Elizabeth

20:22.360 --> 20:37.680
Lynn, Marta Randall, Barry Longyear, Warren Norwood, Jessica Salmonson, and I'd
say three or four more.

20:44.260 --> 20:51.360
Since Curtis represents all sorts of authors who write for the paperbacks, we
asked him about the popularity of genre literature, such as Westerns, romances,

20:51.540 --> 20:57.840
mysteries, science fiction, and so forth. The publishers, for instance, create
the market for these books and thereby, in a sense, determine readers' taste.

20:57.840 --> 21:13.400
It's hard to say. Sometimes the publishers create the taste, and sometimes the
market, the consumer, creates the demand. Sometimes it's the agent. For

21:13.400 --> 21:25.840
instance, I find myself very often in speaking to publishers, I find myself in a
double role. I keep my ears open and try to listen to what a publisher tells me

21:25.840 --> 21:37.720
about what he's able to sell and what he's not able to sell. And so I have a
kind of passive role in that I pass along to authors what the publishers tell me

21:37.720 --> 21:51.640
the market is doing. However, if I begin to notice a trend, I then try to help
create a market by turning to other publishers and saying, listen, I've had

21:51.640 --> 22:03.980
lunch the last couple of months with four publishers, and they all tell me that
hard science fiction is not as active as fantasy and sword and sorcery, and so

22:03.980 --> 22:15.400
maybe you'd be interested in some sort of sorcery. So an agent is in the
position of shaping the market once he begins to detect the trend. More next

22:15.400 --> 22:16.560
time with Agent Richard Curtis.

22:23.600 --> 22:31.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:31.680 --> 22:32.440
Odessa, Texas.

23:20.340 --> 23:24.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:40.400 --> 23:45.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.280
And here are your hosts.

23:54.300 --> 24:01.740
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Richard Curtis has been a literary agent
for over 25 years, and he represents some of today's most popular science

24:01.740 --> 24:08.860
fiction and fantasy authors. He also writes a column in the science fiction
magazine Locus, which contains all sorts of practical advice for writers of any

24:08.860 --> 24:15.780
genre. Many science fiction fans, of course, have often wondered if they could
make it as writers. We asked Curtis if he had any advice for aspiring science

24:15.780 --> 24:29.360
fiction or fantasy authors. Always begin with the magazines. You're absolutely
right about science fiction fans being more fanatic, but they are also fortunate

24:29.360 --> 24:43.640
in having a place where they can begin in the shorter media, where most writers
in other genres don't have the chance. I mean, there are very few places where a

24:43.640 --> 24:56.820
romance writer can teethe. You know, you can't write romance short stories
unless you try to write for some of the slicker women's magazines, and they're,

24:56.880 --> 25:11.140
of course, very demanding in what they accept. There used to be Western
magazines, many, many of them, but those, almost all of them, are gone now.

25:12.100 --> 25:25.320
Mystery magazines, there are still a couple of them, but it's not like what it
used to be when I got into the business about 25 years ago. So one of the few

25:25.320 --> 25:38.420
remaining genres that invites new talent and cultivates it is science fiction,
where you have very active magazine market and anthology market for original

25:38.420 --> 25:47.900
stories. Besides this advice, Curtis says there's one particular aspect of
science fiction that can also help a beginning writer. You also have

25:47.900 --> 25:59.100
conventions. Of course, Western writers, romance writers, mystery writers also
have their conventions, but certainly science fiction writers can out-convention

25:59.100 --> 26:13.600
anybody by a ratio of 10 to 1. So there's a lot of interplay where authors are
always talking to one another, meeting editors, meeting professional writers,

26:13.920 --> 26:28.440
and there's a much tighter unity than there is in any other genre. So I would
definitely advise any aspiring science fiction writer to start writing in the

26:28.440 --> 26:43.940
magazines. In fact, even some of my well-known clients, I still tell them to
continue writing for science fiction magazines, even though they may get peanuts

26:43.940 --> 26:57.040
for their work compared to what they can get writing books, because the exposure
among both science fiction editors and science fiction fans is terribly

26:57.040 --> 27:05.140
important. Regular readers of science fiction and fantasy have certainly noticed
a great number of trilogies in the past few years. Right. It almost seems as if

27:05.140 --> 27:12.800
authors plan on writing a three-book series when they begin a novel. We asked
Curtis if he, as an agent, liked to receive trilogies from his authors. The

27:12.800 --> 27:26.200
beauty of a trilogy, of course, is, from an agent's viewpoint, is in the kind of
package deal that one can make, where you not only sign an author up for a book,

27:26.280 --> 27:38.620
but you can sign him up for a sequel and a sequel after that. And the author
knows where he's going to be two years from now. The publisher knows what he can

27:38.620 --> 27:51.420
expect over a couple of years. And unless the author one day runs out of steam
or gets bored with the characters that he developed in book one or two, you can

27:51.420 --> 28:03.780
see a cumulative effect in the sales of a trilogy, where publication of book two
makes people scurry for book one, and publication of book three causes the

28:03.780 --> 28:16.260
publisher to reissue books one and two, and then they put them in a box set, and
they're reviewed as a whole. It's a very nice way of publishing books, but not

28:16.260 --> 28:18.020
everybody has a sequel in them.

28:25.520 --> 28:33.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:33.840 --> 28:34.900
Odessa, Texas.
