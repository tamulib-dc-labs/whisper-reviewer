00:01.500 --> 00:05.100
Uh, yeah, ask him about the weather or how is the trip up here, just anything to get him to talk.

00:05.660 --> 00:06.500
Or her to talk.

00:10.500 --> 00:18.120
Now you're recording. Now press pause at the same time. Now you're recording. Now press pause. Now press stop.

00:19.060 --> 00:19.520
And play.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.540
And always make sure the red record lights on, otherwise you're not doing anything.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.680
Right now it's recording.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.400
The red lights on is recording. Red light is not on, it is not recording.

00:34.560 --> 00:34.880
Okay.

00:38.540 --> 00:44.520
Testing, one, two, three, four. Testing. This is a science fiction radio show. Testing, one, two, three, four, five, six. Testing.

00:44.520 --> 00:44.660
Testing.

00:49.860 --> 00:56.580
About people with unusual lifestyles and they interviewed me nonstop on TV.

00:57.260 --> 01:05.060
Oh, we're in 45 minutes and then spent another 45 minutes going around the place of close-ups on various interesting things in the collection.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.100
I don't know what that'll all be boiled down to.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.140
By the way, I've always been asked if somebody would move.

01:13.060 --> 01:14.520
Did your collection open in a hurry?

01:16.660 --> 01:20.440
Okay, test. Very good.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.900
When did you first get interested or become exposed to science fiction?

01:26.660 --> 01:29.540
Well, I'm afraid I wasted the first nine years of my life.

01:29.540 --> 01:39.100
In October 1926, I was passing by a newsstand and the issue of amazing stories for that month jumped right off the stand, grabbed hold of me, said,

01:39.320 --> 01:42.840
take me home little boy, you will love me and it will become a way of life.

01:44.340 --> 01:53.100
And in those early days, there was just the one magazine a month and it was like a man in a desert who sees an oasis.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.220
You know, you head for any drop of water you can find.

01:57.320 --> 02:04.000
I began combing the magazine markets, looking at the mundane periodicals in Liberty magazine.

02:04.360 --> 02:12.640
Occasionally, I found something new by H.G. Wells or Sax Romer with his Fumand Choo, super scientific villain.

02:12.640 --> 02:21.660
And in the pages of Argus, I discovered that this magazine, besides having westerns and romance and air war and whatnot,

02:21.860 --> 02:25.220
that they generally had some science fiction going.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.860
Some of the pioneer authors of Ray Cummings and R.F. Starsell and Victor Russo,

02:30.980 --> 02:37.440
there was a lot of Burroughs, Mars and Venus and Palucidar and those, and also in Blue Book Magazine.

02:37.440 --> 02:43.540
By 1930, we had about seven magazines.

02:43.920 --> 02:50.000
We had the amazing Quarterlies in addition to the Monthlies and Science Wonder had come along,

02:50.060 --> 02:53.360
which also had a Quarterly publication and Air Wonder.

02:53.800 --> 03:01.620
And there was astounding stories of super science started up, which is still going today under the modified title,

03:01.620 --> 03:09.520
Analog Science Fiction, and that original amazing from April 1926 is still being published and in my collection.

03:10.240 --> 03:20.220
By about 1929, rather mundane mother had begun to be somewhat worried about my collecting instinct.

03:20.520 --> 03:31.580
She encountered my magazine and said,

03:32.320 --> 03:38.260
Well, my dear mother lived till nearly 94 and was in my own home at the end of her life.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.440
Home was now four stories, 17 rooms, three garages in which you couldn't park a toothpick

03:44.440 --> 03:51.600
because we eliminated the cars from them and put in shelves and that is totaled with the science fiction collections.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.060
Matter of fact, whenever I see a garage sale nowadays, I buy another garage.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.580
I have two extra garages that are filling up around Los Angeles.

03:59.580 --> 04:05.300
So the collection has grown from that one single magazine back in October 1926.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.480
Here I am on the verge of my 55th anniversary in the field.

04:09.580 --> 04:21.020
Now there are 300,000 magazines and books and manuscripts and props from movies and artwork and stills.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.920
I stop at nothing.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.480
I even try to get space stamps from all over the world.

04:28.380 --> 04:34.320
It wouldn't be any stretch of the imagination to say that you have probably the most complete collection of science fiction anywhere.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.960
Well, that's what it is.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.300
I've been on both sides of the Iron Curtain.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.200
I've been upside down in Tasmania.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.620
I've been a thousand miles from the North Pole.

04:42.860 --> 04:47.860
I've been in Hungary and Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

04:48.220 --> 04:53.800
I've been to Japan and if there's any greater collection, it must be underground or well hidden.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.880
Naturally, I'm so intensely interested in the subject matter that I seek out collectors everywhere in the world.

05:01.660 --> 05:10.380
There are maybe half a dozen of us who have equal collections of magazines, as to say about 99% complete.

05:11.460 --> 05:16.020
There are certainly collectors with enormous numbers of books,

05:16.020 --> 05:23.520
but I go beyond that into autographs of the authors and the motion picture people.

05:23.720 --> 05:30.620
I go have Baylor Lugosi would sign Count Dracula and Frederick March, you've got an Academy Award for Jekyll and Hyde.

05:30.640 --> 05:39.060
He was signed for me both as Jekyll and as Hyde and I got Boris Karloff to sign as the Frankenstein monster and the mummy.

05:39.060 --> 05:52.060
And so, last 50 years I've wound up with 125,000 stills from all the fantastic movies ever made in the world.

05:52.280 --> 05:58.140
And 18,000 lobby cards and uncounted thousands of clippings.

05:58.840 --> 06:08.800
I get Hollywood Reporter and Variety and Publishers Weekly and I constantly cut out everything concerning science fiction and fantasy.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.780
And file it away.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.740
Did that lead to your involvement with the magazine that you edited?

06:15.980 --> 06:19.620
Well, you've got the past tense on that. It's very much alive and well.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.960
In the last 23 years I've done 179 issues.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.360
I don't even think of it as editing famous monsters of film land magazine.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.280
It's pretty much of a one man show.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.720
I virtually write everything in every issue of it.

06:35.720 --> 06:41.060
I figured out at the rate it's going that in 1984 we'll reach issue number 200.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.260
This is the great thing about tapes. You can just stop for a second.

06:48.180 --> 06:48.620
No problem.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.880
Dude, which of the levels in his microphone that's not even reaching the red on your head?

06:57.180 --> 06:58.860
Oh, it's close, Earl.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.280
This will be copied and equalized.

07:02.980 --> 07:03.900
How are we doing it?

07:04.540 --> 07:05.980
It's good enough to go over here.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.220
We've got some electronic wizardry gadgets that we put this through before it actually gets edited.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.200
Test.

07:14.840 --> 07:15.060
Okay.

07:17.420 --> 07:22.460
What I'm going to do now is get over to the... Bill, do you want to ask some questions on collections?

07:22.680 --> 07:23.940
Bill is our resident collector.

07:25.260 --> 07:27.340
Yeah, whenever it's convenient.

07:28.300 --> 07:28.820
Okay.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.940
Let's see, I'm getting my train of thought back on the track here.

07:38.940 --> 07:45.860
You're considered, if not the first, one of the original science fiction fans.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.600
Not to go into any great length, but how did fandom get started?

07:53.940 --> 08:01.220
Well, I believe fandom got started through the readers' departments that we discovered each other,

08:01.280 --> 08:07.420
began writing letters. By the time I was 15, I was corresponding with 116 boys and one girl.

08:09.420 --> 08:16.040
Girls were as rare as pterodactyl's teeth 50 years ago in the science fiction reading world.

08:16.040 --> 08:24.500
So through correspondence, the notion came up of clubs that could operate through the mail.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.520
I created one, the Boys Science Fiction Club, in 1930.

08:29.140 --> 08:36.880
Ten cents a month dues, that would postage, which is two cents to move a book around the country in those days,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.760
or three magazines for that price.

08:39.420 --> 08:44.380
So you joined, you sent me a photograph of yourself, a hardcover book,

08:44.380 --> 08:51.220
since there were no paperbacks yet, or three issues of a magazine containing a serial.

08:51.500 --> 08:56.720
Then as the library and I mailed these all around the country, and actually the other parts of the world,

08:56.860 --> 09:03.280
I had science fiction correspondence in England, Russia, and Hungary and Ireland,

09:03.420 --> 09:06.560
that I think Australia also, I think of at the present time.

09:08.200 --> 09:15.580
And a lot of those 117 boys and girls, and I got involved with some science fiction authors,

09:15.800 --> 09:19.900
and since I was born in Hollywood and used to hang around the studios and get autographs,

09:19.900 --> 09:25.660
that occurred to me that I could also get autographs through the mail of science fiction writers and artists.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.880
And then I began to get information from them.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.320
I thought I'd like to share this with my correspondent friends.

09:32.320 --> 09:38.540
At first I used carbon paper and would get half a dozen illegible sheets of news,

09:38.760 --> 09:45.180
and then I was introduced to the glories of Hectograph in about 1931,

09:45.380 --> 09:49.680
put out a little two-page science fiction fanzine called The Meteor,

09:50.020 --> 09:54.160
and reproduced the autographs of Ray Cummings and Edmund Hamilton,

09:54.420 --> 09:57.480
who were two of the big pioneer authors of the day.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.670
And that little Hectograph de Faer was seen by Julia Schwartz and Mortimer Weisinger,

10:04.260 --> 10:09.580
who for many years have been in charge of Batman and Superman comics.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.460
But way back then in 1932 they said,

10:13.580 --> 10:18.440
well, we're here on the east coast where we can see the editors and publishers

10:18.440 --> 10:21.640
and a lot of the science fiction authors, and you're out there in Hollywood

10:21.640 --> 10:26.480
where you can cover such science fiction film activity as there is.

10:26.480 --> 10:32.680
Why don't we combine our knowledge and make an actual little Mimeograph magazine.

10:33.100 --> 10:39.820
So in 1932, February, the first real science fiction fanzine was born, the Time Traveler.

10:45.280 --> 10:45.680
Okay.

10:47.320 --> 10:47.720
Things...

10:51.200 --> 10:53.520
I'm going to jump-jump topic here.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.540
Aside from your involvement in fanzines and fandom,

10:59.400 --> 11:02.400
you've also been an agent for several science fiction authors, haven't you?

11:02.780 --> 11:04.380
Well, again, that's not past tense.

11:04.820 --> 11:05.520
Are an agent.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.680
After three years, five months, and 29 days of World War II,

11:09.940 --> 11:13.860
I was kind of wary of having bosses,

11:14.100 --> 11:17.120
and I looked around for something I could do where I'd be my own man,

11:17.120 --> 11:20.380
and I decided that life had trended me toward being a literary agent.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.940
I would try my hand and talons at that.

11:22.940 --> 11:25.040
So I started out at the age of 32.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.800
The first year I was a science fiction specialist,

11:28.000 --> 11:34.140
I made $1,075 in commissions, spent $1,025 in postage,

11:34.240 --> 11:35.840
and wound up with a big, fat $50.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.140
So I would have been out of business before I hardly began,

11:40.220 --> 11:44.580
except things began to pick up at a quantum rate starting with year two.

11:44.820 --> 11:50.820
I got AE Van Vogt, one of the stellar writers of all time in the science fiction field,

11:50.820 --> 11:51.600
as a client.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.260
He's been with me nonstop for 33 years.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.380
And at one time and another, I've represented Raymond F. Jones.

12:01.540 --> 12:06.100
I was at the time that his book reached the screen as this island, Earth.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.720
At the present time, I'm representing 140 writers.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.260
I'm an agent for the estate of Hugo Gernsback,

12:14.440 --> 12:17.900
who, of course, initiated science fiction in this country,

12:17.900 --> 12:20.540
and I carry on for Frank R. Paul's widow.

12:20.820 --> 12:26.420
Paul was the original artist who dominated the field for about the first ten years.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.040
And then I have upcoming authors like Donald Glute.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.400
He was 18 weeks on the bestseller list with his novelization of The Empire Strikes Back.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.640
And now once a year, he's doing an original screenplay.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.900
There's a character in Japan called Ultraman.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.940
Ultraman has been very popular on TV for about 20 years.

12:48.500 --> 12:54.080
And Ultraman is going to have an American version, a total American cast director,

12:54.240 --> 13:01.600
production, everything USA, and Don Glute be writing that script each year.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.460
So at the present time, with my right hand,

13:04.600 --> 13:08.480
I'm representing 140 science fiction and fantasy authors.

13:08.480 --> 13:13.460
With my left hand, I write famous monsters magazine every month.

13:13.460 --> 13:18.720
With my middle hand, I go out to universities and lecture

13:18.720 --> 13:20.820
and occasionally do a cameo in a movie.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.600
The most recent one was The Howling.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.840
And there's one coming up, you might say, as typecasting.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.920
I played a curator of the last museum on Earth after World War III,

13:30.040 --> 13:31.500
as destroyed civilization.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.660
That's a picture called Aftermath.

13:36.220 --> 13:40.600
And I rush around this world going off to Russia next year

13:40.600 --> 13:43.200
with about 40 science fiction personalities.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.540
We'll go to Moscow, Kiev, and Leningrad.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.280
And then I'll go to Greece for the first time in my life.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.340
Science fiction has taken me all around this world,

13:54.360 --> 13:56.140
upside down in Tasmania,

13:56.140 --> 14:00.200
and a thousand miles from the North Pole and behind the Iron Curtain,

14:00.220 --> 14:02.100
and to Japan.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.760
I'm now in contact with two science fiction clubs in China.

14:06.760 --> 14:13.440
So I imagine before my life story is through that I'll find myself in Shanghai and Kwong Tung.

14:17.120 --> 14:17.600
Bill?

14:18.540 --> 14:18.940
Okay.

14:19.840 --> 14:20.300
Yeah.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.500
I have to go pretty quick. I have two questions coming up.

14:23.520 --> 14:23.760
Sure.

14:24.140 --> 14:24.300
Yeah.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.360
Let me. Were you in Kentucky Fried Movie?

14:27.700 --> 14:27.940
Yes.

14:28.140 --> 14:28.420
Okay.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.760
I thought your mother let... did she know you saw that?

14:31.820 --> 14:32.760
Yeah, that's...

14:35.720 --> 14:37.920
Mr. Ackerman, I have a two-part question.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.600
Number one, you have written science fiction because I've read the stories.

14:43.140 --> 14:47.440
The first part of the question would be why you didn't continue as an author.

14:48.260 --> 14:55.620
And secondly, I can't think of any other field where there's such a unique and intimate relationship between fans and writers.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.980
I wonder why that is so.

14:59.460 --> 15:07.960
Well, when I was a kid, when I was in high school, I edited the high school newspaper and the annual publication.

15:08.180 --> 15:10.800
I carried on much the same way in college.

15:11.100 --> 15:15.560
And I firmly believed that I would grow up to be a science fiction writer.

15:15.740 --> 15:26.720
But when I got around to writing, I searched my mind and I was a little chagrin to find that I wasn't going to be another H.G. Wells or O.F. Stapledon

15:26.720 --> 15:28.460
or Arthur C. Clarke.

15:28.520 --> 15:33.300
I guess I had to set two grandiose ideals for myself.

15:33.680 --> 15:41.800
I just expected somehow or other I got to be 20, 25 or 30 that I would be bubbling over with books like Childhood's End

15:41.800 --> 15:45.940
and The Shape of Things to Come and The Best of Heinlein and so on.

15:45.960 --> 15:53.880
And I found... I say I searched my mind and found that I just didn't have these book-length novels in me.

15:53.880 --> 16:00.880
On the other hand, I did seem to excel in the O. Henry type of short, short story.

16:01.060 --> 16:06.400
And I finally wrote the world's shortest published science fiction story.

16:07.320 --> 16:15.940
Ray Bradbury, whose first story I had edited and published in 1938, had called me up some years later in a great state of excitement.

16:16.140 --> 16:19.320
He said, For you, I just sold a story for one dollar a word.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.200
Every little A and the but or hum hum.

16:23.780 --> 16:25.320
Well, I kind of mentally gave up.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.940
I thought, Oh my God, a dollar a word.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.960
I would never reach that altitude.

16:30.640 --> 16:39.720
But 1973, I think I was asked to do a best of the year anthology.

16:39.900 --> 16:45.800
And then looking at all the stories that year, I found a real cute one that I think was just three words long.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.840
So I thought, Well, I can top that.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.640
I can do one that's two words long.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.300
Let's call it World War III and the story is the end.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.460
So after I mentally wrote that, well, it's no use stopping the air.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.700
My mind's well going, write the one word story and be done with it.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.900
And I came up with something I've forgotten in the meantime.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.680
I said, No, no use stopping there.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.020
Somebody will come up with a story that is one letter of the alphabet long.

17:11.160 --> 17:11.880
That better be me.

17:11.880 --> 17:19.320
So I wrote that story and I was paid $100 for a single letter of the alphabet.

17:20.480 --> 17:25.280
I went on to sell the story four more times each time for $100.

17:25.820 --> 17:28.660
So I got $500 for a single letter of the alphabet.

17:29.220 --> 17:36.580
Of course, I retained the translation rights for the story and the movie rights and the comic book rights.

17:36.580 --> 17:43.900
And I very sneakily copied right at the other 26 letters of the alphabet so that nobody could use them for science fiction stories.

17:45.500 --> 17:53.520
And since a normal size word, as an average word is about five letters in length,

17:53.700 --> 18:02.200
in effect I've collected about $2,500 for one word, which perhaps should be again as a world record.

18:02.780 --> 18:09.460
But I say I'm just searching myself, found that apparently I was not a novelist but a short story writer.

18:09.620 --> 18:15.100
And I've done enough of those to have at least one collection way back in 1935.

18:15.100 --> 18:15.920
I think it was.

18:16.160 --> 18:22.280
I collaborated with the Dan Venge's current guest of honor, Catherine Moore, and wrote Nymph of Darkness.

18:24.080 --> 18:29.640
And you were asking why there's such a liaison between the authors and the fans.

18:29.640 --> 18:39.900
I imagine because most authors start out as fans like myself, I remember very well what it was to go to the first world science fiction in 1939,

18:40.980 --> 18:52.260
admiring Ray Cummings and Heldsberg de Kamp and Manly Wade Wellman and seeing Virgil Findley.

18:52.260 --> 19:00.700
And then myself eventually becoming somewhat in the same genre with them.

19:01.860 --> 19:14.700
So I think that Van Vogt and Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clark all perfectly well remember their humble beginnings when they were writing for fanzines.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.320
I've got to go, David.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.880
Thank you, sir. It was a pleasure to meet you.

19:19.880 --> 19:20.300
Okay.

19:24.040 --> 19:29.700
Mr. Ackerman, you're known as quite a fan.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.820
But to, okay.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.020
Let him go.

19:36.020 --> 19:40.700
Okay, you're known as quite a fan, but to us collectors, you're also known as the ultimate collector.

19:40.700 --> 19:49.300
When did you start collecting science fiction and how did, what was your first goal and how has that goal changed as far as what you're trying to collect?

19:50.860 --> 20:02.740
Well, in October 1926 when I first saw Science Fiction magazine, I was only nine years old and I don't believe I realized the periodicity of publications.

20:02.740 --> 20:09.160
I guess I thought it was some kind of a one-time phenomenon and there would never be another amazing story.

20:09.380 --> 20:16.100
And it wasn't until some months later in 1928 that I saw amazing stories again.

20:16.200 --> 20:23.240
Then I caught on to the fact that if I watched the newsstands carefully, about every four weeks there would be more manna from heaven.

20:24.620 --> 20:36.600
So I read the magazine so quickly that there was nothing coming along for another month that I would reread the stories.

20:37.580 --> 20:47.140
And so I hung on to the magazines because they were very precious to me and before I knew it, my mother said I had 27 of them.

20:47.140 --> 20:51.680
And by about 1930 I probably had around a hundred of them.

20:53.000 --> 21:03.220
And one mad moment in my life during the Depression, my parents persuaded me to sell my magazines in order to finance new ones

21:03.220 --> 21:11.600
because 25 cents was kind of tough to come by when men were starving on the streets trying to make a living selling apples for a nickel.

21:12.600 --> 21:17.740
Well, I did sell my collections such as it was about 1930.

21:18.720 --> 21:25.820
And before their very eyes my parents saw me becoming weak and wand and listless and lost my appetite.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.840
And about 48 hours was all they could take of that.

21:30.980 --> 21:36.140
So I said, OK, OK, you know, go and buy your magazines back if they mean so much to you.

21:36.140 --> 21:40.920
And from that day to this I have never passed by a magazine.

21:41.280 --> 21:46.520
I just buy every single science fiction fantasy magazine as fast as they are published,

21:46.920 --> 21:53.960
have a standing order for every paperback to be sent to me, go through publishers weekly every seven days,

21:54.280 --> 22:04.060
and locus and any source whatsoever that instances fantasy magazines and books and send off for all of them.

22:04.060 --> 22:08.900
And then I go through catalogs from all over the world and constantly mining the past.

22:09.060 --> 22:14.040
You would think that someday you'd say, well, I've got it all, but there just seems to be no end to it.

22:14.060 --> 22:14.880
A perfect example.

22:15.100 --> 22:20.280
I went to the World Science Fiction Convention down in Australia, walked a half a block from my hotel,

22:20.520 --> 22:23.160
and saw a science fiction book in a window.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.920
And I said, well, I don't have it.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.940
I suppose it was published here in Australia.

22:27.420 --> 22:31.420
But I went in and I found it was published in New York seven years earlier.

22:31.420 --> 22:37.200
And despite every review I'd read and every list I'd looked at, I hadn't known of it until that moment.

22:39.180 --> 22:47.000
So I feel my collection is incomplete if someone who's looking at it suddenly says, oh, don't you have?

22:47.300 --> 22:53.200
And I've got 300,000 things, but I don't have this one particular magazine or book.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.760
So I guess I'll have to get it.

22:55.760 --> 23:01.940
How has, where you've housed the collection through the years changed from your humble beginnings until now?

23:02.240 --> 23:04.700
Well, started out in San Francisco.

23:05.100 --> 23:10.360
I had, down in the basement, my dad built me a little den.

23:11.060 --> 23:15.240
And I was able to keep everything in one very small room.

23:15.400 --> 23:20.940
Then when I moved back to Los Angeles where I was born, I lived with my maternal grandparents.

23:21.870 --> 23:26.210
And they had a rather large apartment plus three garages.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.640
That's where I started filling up garages before I knew it.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.780
They were full.

23:32.520 --> 23:41.320
And in the hallway in my maternal grandparents' home, I began stacking books up to the ceiling.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.600
And they gave me one bedroom.

23:43.600 --> 23:48.920
And pretty soon it was difficult even to get into bed because it was totally surrounded.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.820
I remember Life Magazine came to me 30 years ago.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.440
1951 took a photo of me in that bedroom.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.520
And in 1951, I finally moved into my first home.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.980
That had 13 rooms and three garages.

24:02.480 --> 24:11.820
And when I totaled that, and I really mean totaled it, used as many drawers as weren't absolutely necessary for clothing.

24:11.820 --> 24:15.040
They had books and magazines and put them under the beds.

24:15.340 --> 24:18.880
And we didn't need all the bathrooms, so I filled those.

24:19.060 --> 24:25.400
And finally, when my wife, the university professor and science fiction translator, came home and looked in the refrigerator one day.

24:25.760 --> 24:30.220
And found the food was gone, replaced by reels of science fiction movies.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.320
She realized the end had come for that home.

24:33.480 --> 24:41.200
So for a couple of years, we lived in an apartment while I used a 13-room home and three garages totally for my collection.

24:41.200 --> 24:48.660
We started all over again eight years ago with a four-story, 17-room home in the usual three garages.

24:49.380 --> 24:54.780
And now that's bursting at the seams, and I've added two garages to them renting around town.

24:54.780 --> 24:59.000
Unfortunately, the mayor of Los Angeles has come to my rescue.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.200
He discovered me, came out to the house, had four librarians come and look at everything,

25:04.420 --> 25:09.540
and they estimated there are approximately 300,000 pieces in the collection.

25:10.200 --> 25:14.540
And the city of Los Angeles in the near future is going to create an actual museum.

25:15.200 --> 25:22.320
It won't just be a wing of the library or anything of that sort, but an actual, bonafide science fiction museum.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.960
But already when you're three blocks away, the structure of it will tell the story.

25:27.140 --> 25:29.540
It'll just say, hey, that's got to be the museum.

25:30.280 --> 25:36.860
And the grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs has already indicated to me when the museum exists

25:36.860 --> 25:40.580
that he'd be very happy to have an Edgar Rice Burroughs wing in it

25:40.580 --> 25:49.500
and make all of the first editions available in manuscripts and the artwork by J. Allen, St. John, and others.

25:50.560 --> 25:56.560
And I think that Hollywood will very much get into the act once it exists.

25:57.020 --> 26:03.760
And in addition to the props I've been able to acquire on my own, like Baila Lugosi's Dracula Cave and Lon Cheney Seniors,

26:03.760 --> 26:12.400
Makeup Kit and Life Masks of Karloff and Peter Lorre and John Caradine and Vincent Price

26:12.400 --> 26:22.720
and many of the animated monsters from King Kong and Harryhausen films that I imagine the Star Wars people

26:23.660 --> 26:30.320
and Alien and so on, they will be all quick to contribute because everybody will want to be represented

26:30.320 --> 26:36.680
in something that is available to the public seven days a week, people for all over the world

26:36.680 --> 26:42.540
to come and see something like Disneyland and Magic Castle and Universal Tour and so on.

26:44.140 --> 26:47.360
Is this something that the City of Los Angeles will sponsor entirely?

26:48.380 --> 26:50.780
Well, I think it'll be in two parts.

26:51.140 --> 26:55.520
About the 15th of September I'm going to go down to the mayor's office.

26:55.520 --> 27:03.940
They tell me that they have found a benefactor who is going to create a cultural center and make the museum a centerpiece of it.

27:04.160 --> 27:09.100
It'll be one thing just to move it out of my home.

27:09.140 --> 27:14.160
They estimate it'll take $125,000 just to move it to its final resting place.

27:14.980 --> 27:20.460
And surely it costs multi-millions of dollars for the museum itself.

27:20.460 --> 27:26.100
And I don't want to just froze them the day I give it away. That's it. It never grows.

27:26.140 --> 27:34.420
I hope that 200 years after I'm gone that it will still be up to date that all the magazines and books and posters and everything will be added.

27:35.000 --> 27:43.640
I think the City feels its responsibility will be to create the housing for it originally.

27:43.640 --> 27:52.160
And then they hope to institute what they call a support committee.

27:52.740 --> 28:04.440
They're going to invite Robert Block, A.E. Van Vogt, Ray Bradbury, Steven Spielberg, Steven King, George Lucas, John Landis,

28:05.860 --> 28:14.440
maybe way over there in Sri Lanka, Arthur C. Clarke, all the independently wealthy science fiction practitioners

28:15.320 --> 28:24.300
to see if they would like to pitch in. For instance, George Lucas, I think, gave something like a million and a half recently to the university where he had graduated.

28:24.300 --> 28:31.800
So some of these high-powered, financially set people will get in the act and contribute.

28:31.980 --> 28:37.060
They'll be the sponsoring committee to make it possible to go on adding to it.

28:37.320 --> 28:44.720
I would like to see a theater in conjunction with it where you'll be seeing all the classic movies constantly

28:44.720 --> 28:54.820
and to have a fund that I might mastermind as the curator to purchase fine artwork

28:54.820 --> 29:00.000
and something we should have in such a collection.

29:00.280 --> 29:05.580
For instance, the first edition of Frankenstein, which is rather difficult to come by because it wasn't a single book.

29:05.660 --> 29:12.600
It was three books. And I think at the present time, I know of a set that's around 4,500.

29:13.960 --> 29:18.620
And something like the autograph of Edgar Allen Poe ought to be in the collection.

29:18.740 --> 29:23.940
Fortunately, I do have Welles' autograph because I saw him in person and shook hands with him.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.660
And I've been able to acquire the signature of Mary Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein and have a letter by Jules Verne.

29:31.340 --> 29:40.380
But these really costly things is going to have to be people like those I just instanced that will be able to finance it.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.960
Okay. That's all I have.

29:49.860 --> 29:54.980
I remember reading through the magazines and whatnot, your efforts to get all this.

29:55.500 --> 30:00.700
The museum started so there would be a permanent place to collect this.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.480
When you get it all moved out of your 17 room house, you see actual walls in the house.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.800
Are you going to start at the first spot?

30:15.020 --> 30:15.980
Book one.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.960
Start filling it up again.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.680
Well, I really won't need a 17 room home anymore.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.060
I'll be 65 in a few months.

30:26.220 --> 30:27.960
Before I turn around, I'll be 70.

30:28.980 --> 30:31.400
Obviously nearer the end of my life than the beginning.

30:31.700 --> 30:37.160
So we'll kind of cool it and get a more modest home for the last years of our life.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.420
But I'll always want a guest room.

30:39.720 --> 30:45.300
And I think I'm always going to keep several hundred really favorite things around me.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.240
Best books.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.300
Your wife must have been very understanding through these years.

30:51.680 --> 30:58.020
Well, fortunately, she was a science fiction fan all of her life before she met up with me.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.840
Only she was a fan in French and German.

31:00.740 --> 31:04.860
And when she came to this country around 33 years ago,

31:05.600 --> 31:09.400
she gravitated toward becoming a book clerk.

31:10.300 --> 31:15.180
And one day I walked up to her a whole stack of books to buy.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.460
And she said, I mean, I wait on you, sir.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.980
And that was her fatal mistake.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.920
Been doing so ever since.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.580
May I get you to sign my...

31:27.580 --> 31:27.760
Sure.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.900
Your autograph is gonna be...
