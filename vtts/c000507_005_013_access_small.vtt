Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.640
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.000
And here are your hosts.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.920
This is Daryl Lane.

03:00.160 --> 03:00.840
And David Cruz.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.980
Norman Spinrad has strong opinions about science fiction in its place in today's world.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.760
As a noted author who helped bring the science fiction new wave to this country,

03:09.060 --> 03:13.780
and is two-time president of the science fiction writers of America, Spinrad's ideas should be heard.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.200
One thing he feels strongly about is that science fiction has not been treated fairly by book reviewers.

03:19.120 --> 03:27.860
As a category, you know, it is treated very, very unfairly and very cavalierly by the powers that be,

03:27.860 --> 03:35.620
which is mainly the New York Times book review and the New York Review of Books and the so-called New York Literary Establishment,

03:35.640 --> 03:38.720
which really does have a very heavy effect on the way books are published.

03:39.520 --> 03:46.660
These people, for instance, came down on the American Book Awards, succeeded in getting science fiction knocked out of the American Book Awards.

03:47.220 --> 03:54.920
A real small clique of people in New York City who felt that it was really bad to have these awards given to things like science fiction,

03:54.920 --> 04:00.400
that it was bad to take it away from a small jury which they could control and have thousands of people voting for,

04:00.660 --> 04:07.700
a very elitist social fascist bunch of people who I am absolutely no use for, and I'm sure they have no use for me.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.480
As president of the science fiction writers of America, Spinrad has worked for some changes in the field.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.560
One thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is the international audience,

04:19.040 --> 04:22.740
is to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of directors.

04:23.340 --> 04:26.520
Science fiction writing and publishing really is an international community.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.460
American writers sell their work all over the world.

04:30.340 --> 04:32.120
English writers sell their work here.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.600
Foreign language writers have different problems and we're all dealing with the same publishers.

04:37.380 --> 04:41.920
It certainly is an international literature and it's the spirit of the future and the spirit of internationalism.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.900
So, of course, I felt it should be an international organization. That's one thing.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.340
The other thing that I want to do and halfway through doing is upgrading the Nebula Awards.

04:51.340 --> 04:55.500
We have moved it out of the World Rec Hotel. We're moving into a much bigger room in the world

04:55.500 --> 04:59.060
offering trying to make it into a more significant event than it has been.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.900
Again, orienting it towards the world at large rather than towards the little in group.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.340
Spinrad has always been concerned with the image science fiction has with the general public.

05:09.660 --> 05:14.860
He thinks general readers should be made more aware of science fiction's unique possibilities and its genuine value.

05:15.220 --> 05:19.840
We asked him if science fiction movies have a positive or negative influence on the public's image of the field.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.020
I don't know. I don't think they...not really.

05:24.540 --> 05:28.060
I mean, the image of science fiction in that respect has been very bad anyway.

05:28.300 --> 05:33.860
I don't think the movies really add to the image, but I don't think they detract from it either.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.880
If there are some better, more sophisticated movies, they might help.

05:38.020 --> 05:42.580
As it is, it's just kind of neutral publicity. People are more aware that it exists.

05:42.740 --> 05:46.660
I think it's positive and will prove to be positive in the long range

05:47.160 --> 05:50.420
because a lot of people are being introduced to the imagery of science fiction

05:50.420 --> 05:52.800
with which they were unfamiliar through these movies.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.380
And if you look at the evolution in the movies, you find that in the earlier science fiction movies,

05:58.680 --> 06:02.580
if you're going into space or whatever, you had to spend like half an hour setting the thing,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.420
this is a spaceship that takes off from the Earth. People float around, you know,

06:06.460 --> 06:10.320
and you have to familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar imagery.

06:10.520 --> 06:14.800
Now they can just start a movie bang right off, in a galaxy far away. Boom.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.740
Here's a spaceship in the stromo pow, you know.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.580
In other words, the first half hour of the conventional old-time science fiction movie is gone

06:21.580 --> 06:23.780
because people are now familiar with this imagery.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.760
And I think these movies have brought a lot of new people into familiarity with these images.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.440
They made these images part of the popular culture.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.180
These movies have been mainly aimed at kids and adolescents.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.200
And years from now, assuming that these people ever read anything,

06:43.140 --> 06:47.880
they'll be ready to read science fiction of a more serious kind.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.300
Assuming they're ready to read literature of a more serious kind or all,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.800
because they'll be familiar with the material, familiar with the literature.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.960
It won't seem strange and weird to them because they will have grown up with it.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.560
That's why I think magazines, even magazines like Star-Walk say,

07:02.240 --> 07:05.760
in that sense will have a long-term positive impact.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.180
More with Norman Spinrad on our next show.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.720
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

07:21.720 --> 07:24.940
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

08:05.540 --> 08:09.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

08:25.420 --> 08:30.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.100
And here are your hosts.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.240
This is David Cruz.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.200
And Daryl Lane.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.500
Norman Spinrad's best-known novel may be Bug Jack Barron,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.520
a book which has stirred controversy in both England and America.

08:48.980 --> 08:53.240
It was published in this country in 1969, and it's a different sort of science fiction novel.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.720
It's a good example of new wave science fiction.

08:56.180 --> 08:59.920
Character and style are important, and it deals with social issues such as racism,

09:00.420 --> 09:03.940
the establishment, drugs, the power of the media, and radical protests.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.080
There is also a good deal of sex and violence in the book, and the language is highly colored.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.300
But Spinrad, thanks to the plot of the book, conforms to traditional science fiction formulas.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.760
Actually, what I was trying to do in a way, the book has a very traditional plot.

09:18.260 --> 09:22.120
As far as I was concerned, it has a positive here, it has negative here.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.160
The hero wins, the villain loses.

09:24.380 --> 09:29.380
All that stuff that is considered the traditional way of plotting a book.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.120
And yet it's written in a different kind of way.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.720
It kind of takes that superficial kind of plot and treats it in a realistic manner.

09:38.820 --> 09:44.780
The protagonist, Jack Barron, is a powerfully influential television star who has a talk show watched by 100 million people.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.660
He uses the show as a battlefield to oppose corrupt elements of society.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.200
Spinrad comments on Barron's use of power.

09:52.180 --> 09:56.000
The book is about power.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.920
Power itself is neutral as far as I'm concerned.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.460
It's what people do with it that counts.

10:02.260 --> 10:07.780
Barron is a guy who likes power and keeps referring to it as a drug.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.900
And knows that he can become addicted to it.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.300
And for that reason, has decided to stay away from it.

10:15.000 --> 10:24.160
Then he gets drawn back into playing with power because he comes to the conclusion that it's better for somebody who feels that way about power to be wielding it,

10:24.460 --> 10:28.640
than people who don't have any self-consciousness about the dangers of wielding power.

10:28.640 --> 10:38.120
So in that sense, it's a comment on the power of the media, but it's also a comment on the morality of power, on the paradox of power,

10:38.220 --> 10:49.820
which is that if you leave power to be wielded by people who do not see the dangers, the personal dangers, the psychological dangers of being involved with it,

10:50.140 --> 10:53.800
then you end up with people like Benedict Howard's Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon,

10:55.220 --> 11:02.740
who do not have self-consciousness about the personal dangers, the moral dangers of chasing after power.

11:02.860 --> 11:06.920
Whereas somebody like Barron, who is certainly an imperfect person, as old people are,

11:07.540 --> 11:18.040
at least his saving grace, if he has one, is that he is well aware of the personal dangers of being involved in a quest for power.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.700
When Spinrad tried to get the novel published in this country, he was unsuccessful, so he tried and written.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.960
But there was an outcry in Parliament against the book. He relates the story for us.

11:48.040 --> 11:55.960
I saw that book here. In the meantime, I took it to Wilford, to a Wilford conference, and Mike Murcock was there, and he read it, and he liked it, and he serialized it.

11:56.020 --> 11:59.980
New World, so the first publication was actually in England, in the magazine.

12:01.940 --> 12:11.720
Now, halfway through the serialization, I forget exactly which part, part three, part four, W. H. Smith, which was the biggest distributor in England,

12:12.320 --> 12:15.040
refused to distribute the magazine because of the book in it.

12:15.600 --> 12:20.880
Now, at that time, New World had an Arts Council grant. The Arts Council was an organ of the British government.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.680
Now, the Arts Council supported the magazine against Smith publicly.

12:26.760 --> 12:37.000
And so the flap in Parliament arose when certain right-wing members of Parliament were aghast that an organ of the British government, the Arts Council, was defending this kind of stuff.

12:37.660 --> 12:40.300
And that's how it became a parliamentary issue.

12:41.660 --> 12:49.160
Bugjack Barron is being made into a movie, with a screenplay by Harlan Ellison and direction by radical filmmaker Costa Gavras. It should be interesting.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.560
More with Norman Spinrad next time.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

14:08.020 --> 14:13.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.720
And here are your hosts.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.560
This is Daryl Lane.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.580
And David Cruz.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.720
Norman Spinrad's 1979 Science Fiction novel, A World Between, signaled a change in his fiction.

14:30.080 --> 14:35.100
Spinrad's early work usually contain either subtle or overt criticism of various aspects of society.

14:35.660 --> 14:40.000
Bugjack Barron, the men in the jungle, and agent of chaos are good examples of this type.

14:40.460 --> 14:45.200
A World Between is also a socially-oriented novel, but there's a different element in it. Spinrad explains.

14:46.360 --> 14:58.780
I would say in general that up until, I guess, A World Between really, a lot of my stuff was kind of critical of this,

14:59.380 --> 15:03.920
or critical of existing societies, critical of various things that were going on.

15:04.540 --> 15:09.360
A World Between is meant as a utopian novel, really, in a kind of way.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.440
And it's a prescriptive kind of book.

15:11.440 --> 15:16.780
It's more of a, instead of presenting critical images of other things,

15:17.060 --> 15:21.980
the idea is to create a more positive image of a more positive kind of future.

15:22.180 --> 15:30.300
I think if you spend enough time criticizing what exists, at some point you have some kind of moral obligation

15:30.300 --> 15:36.620
to present something more positive and replace what you find negative.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.160
The setting for the novel is a fit one for a utopia. It takes place on the planet Pacifica,

15:46.380 --> 15:50.300
a beautiful world of blue ocean and lush green islands that's been colonized by humans.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.940
Inhabitants of Pacifica live private lives in their isolated islands.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.920
There are no large urban centers to cause pollution, overpopulation, or poverty.

15:58.420 --> 16:03.200
Even though they are physically isolated, the Pacificans remain in close electronic contact with one another.

16:03.680 --> 16:09.220
They govern themselves, in fact, with a tight media web that allows them to vote immediately on any issue of importance.

16:09.220 --> 16:13.260
But into this idyllic world comes two opposed political forces from Earth,

16:13.400 --> 16:15.740
bent on the ideological conquest of Pacifica.

16:16.060 --> 16:22.760
One force is the Institute for Transcendental Science, a powerful organization whose goal is galactic unity under their control.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.420
They are extreme, and Spinrad says they have two basic flaws.

16:27.720 --> 16:32.640
One is the unexamined subtle male-shervinist bias of their culture.

16:33.360 --> 16:43.640
The other one is the ultimate conviction that what they are doing is the absolute most important thing in the universe,

16:43.960 --> 16:52.200
and that therefore they are morally entitled to run over other people's cultures and desires.

16:53.880 --> 17:01.820
Absoluteism, I guess, would be the kind of theocratic absolutism would be their flaw.

17:01.820 --> 17:06.420
The other force is the Femocrats, a militant women's liberation group that is also an extreme.

17:06.980 --> 17:11.660
The struggle of these two groups for control of planets all across the galaxy is called the Pink and Blue War.

17:11.960 --> 17:18.200
It's clearly a male-female conflict, and so far every planet the two sides have approached has ended up on one side or the other.

17:18.660 --> 17:22.480
But Pacifica is different. Spinrad's utopia is a stable and intelligent one.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.940
The Pacificans reject both extremes and even change the minds of a few of the combatants.

17:26.940 --> 17:32.780
We asked Spinrad about reactions to the book. How did women, for instance, respond to the Femocratic women's livers?

17:34.020 --> 17:45.820
The strange thing about the reaction to that book has been that a certain number of men have reacted in a kind of male-liberal guilt,

17:46.160 --> 17:49.020
male-feminist kind of reaction against that.

17:49.020 --> 17:54.540
But at most part women have liked the book. Women have identified with it more than men.

17:55.980 --> 17:59.480
And actually I even got one or two good reviews in feminist places.

18:00.360 --> 18:04.020
I think that's not quite what I expected, but that seems to be the way it happened.

18:04.180 --> 18:08.680
I have not gotten a heavy feminist flag from that a little bit, but not much.

18:08.960 --> 18:19.000
Not much because I think women who are involved in feminism or have been or know women who are can recognize a certain aspect of women.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.280
They are the feminist movement in the Femocrats, whereas men who are trying to show how liberator they are would not dream of admitting such a thing.

18:26.900 --> 18:31.580
A world between. A different sort of book for Norman Spinrad, and we'll have more on him tomorrow.

18:38.160 --> 18:47.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

19:47.220 --> 19:52.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.920
And here are your hosts.

20:24.300 --> 20:35.800
Society has split in two factions in songs from the stars. One faction is an Aquarian society which bans all technology, in fact anything having to do with science, since this was what was responsible for almost destroying the earth.

20:36.300 --> 20:43.260
And the other faction are the black scientists who keep technology alive and maintain an illicit smuggling operation with the Aquarian society.

20:43.260 --> 20:45.600
Spinrad talks about these opposed factions.

21:13.260 --> 21:26.140
And here are again another kind of absolutism which doesn't sell. It's a book about horror and unity, I guess.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.040
As usual with Spinrad, the book's conflict reflects current social conditions.

21:31.940 --> 21:41.260
And then you know, a mirror is the present thing in our society where on the one hand you have a great big space movement, people wanting to get into space and all the old people and all that stuff.

21:41.380 --> 21:50.800
On the other hand you have a real atavistic, neo-Luddite movement, an anti-nuclear movement which is really kind of willfully ignorant of a lot of things.

21:52.500 --> 22:02.180
In a way these are the two things that could bring about the crash as well as what with some armaments.

22:02.380 --> 22:15.040
So I think it's basically a book about the grand philosophical attempt at apoc, is to try and bridge the gap between science and reason and feeling emotion and mysticism.

22:16.040 --> 22:28.660
And to point to a horror unity between the two things and away from the false dichotomies and false dualisms which seem to be really destroying Western civilization, that's a large statement.

22:29.900 --> 22:37.460
The protagonist in the book is a laid back Aquarian, clear blue loo. Along with his girl and a scientist, he travels up to a satellite circling the Earth.

22:37.860 --> 22:43.700
There are the three of them receive communication from some incredibly advanced alien civilizations in another part of the galaxy.

22:43.700 --> 22:51.420
With the knowledge sent by the helpful aliens, it seems the humans will solve their own problems, unite and start progressing toward the stars once more.

22:51.780 --> 22:57.600
We asked Spinrad that if and when we contact an alien civilization, is it likely they will be helpful rather than hostile?

22:59.260 --> 23:09.420
As I said in the book, I do believe that any civilization that's going to last a million years, it's going to be a million years or whatever, or even a hundred thousand years more advanced than us,

23:09.700 --> 23:13.060
they've been around that much longer, had that much more advanced science.

23:14.060 --> 23:25.900
If it's going to survive to that length of its own history, it's got to be by that time philosophically and emotionally pretty together or long since it destroyed itself.

23:25.900 --> 23:32.220
I mean, we certainly will not survive a million years of our own history if it continues as it has.

23:33.100 --> 23:42.920
In order that any civilization that survives a million years of its own history has had to have gotten its political, psychological and philosophical act together.

23:43.940 --> 23:45.660
And I don't see why, you know.

23:48.440 --> 23:59.620
And I do believe that if and when we run into that kind of really advanced civilization, that they will, if not be directly, actively helpful,

23:59.760 --> 24:06.300
certainly will be benign and will not be interested in either eating us or conquering our planet or blowing us up or anything like that.

24:07.340 --> 24:12.660
Songs from the Stars is a thoughtfully written book with a theme, but it's also good exciting science fiction.

24:20.240 --> 24:28.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

25:12.300 --> 25:16.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

25:32.040 --> 25:37.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.740
And here are your hosts.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.080
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

25:48.440 --> 25:55.260
James P. Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from Yesteryear, is a fascinating blend of computers, space exploration and genetic engineering.

25:55.760 --> 26:02.540
It's about a robot probe that discovers a habitable planet ten light years from Earth, but it's different than the usual probe imagined by science fiction authors.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.800
Right. This one is equipped to manufacture human beings. Hogan explains.

26:06.800 --> 26:17.640
We read a lot of stories about starships that go on long voyages that take maybe centuries, and inevitably they've got frozen bodies or bodies in suspended animation or something like that.

26:19.740 --> 26:27.360
But when you think about it, it seems rather an inefficient way to say, you know, they're not doing anything, the machines can fly the ship, the computers can get it there.

26:27.360 --> 26:32.920
The people aren't doing anything except, you know, just lying there freezing.

26:33.220 --> 26:39.040
So why not let the machines fly the ship and make the people when you get there?

26:39.760 --> 26:54.380
If we look at the progress made in molecular biology and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades, we already manufactured quite complex organic molecules to specifications, such as drugs and certain anaesthetics.

26:55.040 --> 27:00.100
If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you couldn't make a complete set of human DNA?

27:01.320 --> 27:18.620
In other words, instead of sending bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space, why not just store all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the computers

27:18.620 --> 27:26.260
and create them when you have found the planet that the instruments say they could survive on?

27:26.980 --> 27:30.900
So the computers make a race of humans, raise them, and place them on the planet.

27:31.380 --> 27:35.980
It sounds a bit mechanical, a little inhuman perhaps, but Hogan thinks it could work out beautifully.

27:35.980 --> 27:54.180
So here is the interesting possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos that were created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.

27:55.160 --> 28:03.780
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the machines does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.940
It could be quite a charming and amusing one.

28:07.560 --> 28:28.360
The interesting thoughts that the books are to play with is here is a race of kids that are being raised by some very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities who don't double talk or deceive or have all these layers of human game playing that we have to contend with.

28:29.860 --> 28:44.880
And they're being raised completely without any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults with their prejudices and hatred and taboos.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.920
And a lot of the other nonsense is that make life so complicated in our society.

28:50.800 --> 28:55.320
As you might expect, these machine-raised humans are eventually contacted by humans from Earth.

28:56.140 --> 28:59.560
Now let's imagine that a mission from Earth eventually shows up.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.800
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is usually a 20-year voyage, maybe.

29:07.700 --> 29:13.900
So we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people, a space colony with engines.

29:14.500 --> 29:19.620
With its government, its military, its church organizations, its commercial institutions.

29:20.320 --> 29:28.920
The whole of society in miniature with its time-proved mechanisms for controlling and subordinating a population.

29:29.740 --> 29:44.460
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history has imposed itself by restricting the flow of wealth and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats.

29:45.880 --> 29:52.740
And so what happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race of people-raised people?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.320
And that's really what the story's all about.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.780
Voyage from yesteryear will be out in paperback at the end of July.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.900
Next week we'll have a series of shows on the works of James B. Hogan.

30:08.280 --> 30:17.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
