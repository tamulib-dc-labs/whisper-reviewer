00:12.755 --> 00:36.028
[Tom Turbeville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.048 --> 00:37.210
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm Tom Turbeville.

00:37.645 --> 00:41.910
[Tom Turbeville]: Meet Major Curt Burns, an airman with plenty of passion and little fear.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.892
[Tom Turbeville]: Texas A&M class of 1952.

00:44.893 --> 00:49.398
[Tom Turbeville]: He grew up in a home located about where G. Raleigh White Coliseum stands today.

00:49.959 --> 01:02.292
[Tom Turbeville]: This Aggie was a proud flyer who piloted five different jet fighters during his service in Europe and then Vietnam in all nearly 5,000 hours of flying time in more than 20 years as an Air Force pilot.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.475
[Tom Turbeville]: He still serves the school he loved so dearly.

01:04.835 --> 01:07.298
[Tom Turbeville]: Today, as coach of the A&M pistol team,

01:07.278 --> 01:10.342
[Tom Turbeville]: meet the multi-talented Curt Burns of Bryan.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.505
[Tom Turbeville]: Major Burns, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:12.525 --> 01:17.212
[Tom Turbeville]: I want to talk first about growing up on the Texas A&M campus in the mid to late 30s.

01:17.252 --> 01:18.854
[Tom Turbeville]: That must have been quite an experience.

01:19.575 --> 01:22.459
[Tom Turbeville]: That was back when they had a pretty good football team even back then.

01:22.520 --> 01:29.269
[Tom Turbeville]: Won a national championship two years later and you look through the knothole to watch John Kimbrough practice and play, right?

01:30.650 --> 01:42.381
[SPEAKER_00]: During the time that the team was practicing, playing, every day during football season after school, I was in Antium Consolidated.

01:43.342 --> 01:43.742
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

01:43.762 --> 01:47.466
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would go over to the practice field and watch them practice.

01:48.227 --> 01:48.347
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

01:48.367 --> 01:51.670
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw all the home games.

01:51.690 --> 01:59.037
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, I saw all the home games probably from 1937 until...

01:59.017 --> 02:04.828
[SPEAKER_00]: I left in 1952 and then after I came back in 1972.

02:04.868 --> 02:06.691
[Tom Turbeville]: The campus was quite a bit different then.

02:06.871 --> 02:17.831
[Tom Turbeville]: Kyle Field was just a small one-stack stadium and actually you lived on campus because your father was a professor at the time and most of the faculty lived on campus at that time, right?

02:17.851 --> 02:22.780
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was department heads and deans and higher.

02:22.760 --> 02:32.349
[SPEAKER_00]: And my father had been head of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology for the College of, or rather at that time, the School of Veterinary Medicine.

02:32.369 --> 02:32.869
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

02:32.889 --> 02:33.790
[Tom Turbeville]: You were born in Bryan.

02:33.810 --> 02:49.865
[Tom Turbeville]: You went to A&M Consolidated your freshman year in high school, then went to Stephen F. Austin, which is now Bryan High later on, and went on to Texas A&M, graduated in 1952, and that's about the time the Korean War was going on, so it didn't take long for you to go into active service with the Air Force.

02:50.165 --> 02:51.366
[Tom Turbeville]: Sort of take us through that time.

02:51.532 --> 03:05.951
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I graduated, I was an Air Force officer with TC and had thoughts about being a pilot that were generated generally during World War II when I was following the war very closely.

03:05.971 --> 03:07.836
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had pictures of airplanes all over my wall.

03:08.120 --> 03:32.203
[SPEAKER_00]: in my room right and uh so i came on active duty 52 it took them uh the air force about a year to get me into a class in uh flying school uh at the time i was at this hardship position or our location i was stationed at palm beach international airport they had a uh

03:32.183 --> 03:54.360
[SPEAKER_00]: military air transport service training base down there they trained pilots for c124s and c97s and sa16s and i'd go scrounge rides with pilots as often as i could get off from my work right anyway uh when i then i got into flying school and went to bartow airbase which is a primary contract

03:54.897 --> 04:02.008
[SPEAKER_00]: field in Bartow, Florida, about in the middle of the state, and flew the T6G.

04:02.770 --> 04:03.611
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the T6.

04:03.691 --> 04:06.456
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I thought, an outstanding training plane.

04:06.816 --> 04:11.484
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought if a person could learn to fly a master of the T6, he'd fly anything.

04:11.904 --> 04:18.475
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I was relatively high up in my class and got

04:18.708 --> 04:23.156
[SPEAKER_00]: my choice and I chose Brian for a basic going to jets.

04:23.176 --> 04:23.997
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

04:24.678 --> 04:25.700
[Tom Turbeville]: You told me that was interesting.

04:25.720 --> 04:31.070
[Tom Turbeville]: You said that the class, the top half of the class got to go to jets and the bottom half of the class went to fixed wings.

04:31.210 --> 04:37.761
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true, except for one person in there who had been a SAC navigator in the Strategic Air Command.

04:38.142 --> 04:38.843
[SPEAKER_00]: His goal

04:39.380 --> 04:52.013
[SPEAKER_00]: was to go to multi-engine training and get into the, at that time, very new, KC-135s, put in his normal, or his required commitment, go to work for airlines.

04:52.513 --> 04:54.155
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing wrong with that.

04:54.375 --> 04:54.815
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.

04:55.256 --> 04:56.317
[SPEAKER_00]: He achieved that.

04:56.337 --> 05:03.504
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody else, when the, I can say 14 of the top 30 went to jet bases.

05:03.724 --> 05:04.645
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.

05:05.047 --> 05:08.451
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the chance to come back here to Bryan and do my training.

05:08.671 --> 05:10.332
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah, that was in the early 50s, I guess.

05:10.352 --> 05:10.893
[Tom Turbeville]: You graduated.

05:11.113 --> 05:11.774
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated.

05:11.794 --> 05:15.318
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from September of 53 until September of 54.

05:15.478 --> 05:17.860
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, when you finished flying school.

05:19.202 --> 05:22.765
[Tom Turbeville]: Like we said in the outset, you flew, I think, five different jet fighters.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.468
[Tom Turbeville]: Let's talk about the F-86 because we're going to see a model of that.

05:25.508 --> 05:27.050
[Tom Turbeville]: That was your first and that was your favorite.

05:27.070 --> 05:32.235
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my favorite airplane, my favorite fighter of any.

05:32.215 --> 05:35.400
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, I called it a pussycat.

05:35.821 --> 05:36.622
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get in trouble.

05:36.882 --> 05:37.423
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

05:37.443 --> 05:41.390
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mishandled the airplane, you could get in real trouble.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.171
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

05:42.191 --> 05:47.299
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flew it like a fighter ought to be flown, it was a very forgiving airplane.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.725
[SPEAKER_00]: Had relatively few emergencies in the airplane.

05:50.765 --> 05:55.212
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them, well, I had smoked in the cockpit that I coped with one time every time.

05:55.292 --> 05:58.577
[SPEAKER_00]: And another time I had trouble getting the nose gear down, but I got

06:00.076 --> 06:03.281
[SPEAKER_00]: I held the emergency, landed out, and got it landed okay.

06:05.364 --> 06:13.335
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was fortunate after flying school to have my choice high enough in the class to where I was able to choose F-86.

06:13.435 --> 06:18.923
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a choice assignment, the choicest assignment from basic at the time.

06:19.364 --> 06:19.944
[Tom Turbeville]: Let's move on.

06:19.985 --> 06:23.409
[Tom Turbeville]: I know later on you took your first of what would be two tours of Germany.

06:23.710 --> 06:27.315
[Tom Turbeville]: Let's talk about the first time that you went to Ramstein in Germany.

06:27.397 --> 06:41.510
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been instructing F-86s at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona, and I got this really plumb of an assignment to the 53rd Fighter Day Squadron in what is now Ramstein Air Base, Germany.

06:42.351 --> 06:51.539
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, Fighter Day was air defense, and that was the pinnacle of a fighter pilot's assignment.

06:51.559 --> 06:54.282
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had about half the tour there

06:54.650 --> 06:59.861
[SPEAKER_00]: at Ramstein in air defense as day fighter pilot in the F-100C.

06:59.881 --> 07:06.635
[SPEAKER_00]: The F-100C was probably the best day fighter they had at that time.

07:06.895 --> 07:11.224
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they

07:12.385 --> 07:32.841
[SPEAKER_00]: I reconfigured the whole wing including our squadron as a nuclear strike to the nuclear strike mission and I spent the last half of my tour in the 53rd basically training for and sitting alert on atomic bomb and with

07:34.711 --> 07:45.295
[SPEAKER_00]: task for tactical missions in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and I had one target was in the Soviet Union.

07:45.629 --> 07:55.023
[Tom Turbeville]: I want to backtrack just a little bit back to when you were at Texas A&M and a senior in 1952, right at Eastern 52, before you graduated, you married your wife, Ann.

07:55.364 --> 07:56.005
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes.

07:56.025 --> 07:58.709
[Tom Turbeville]: And a special moment in your life, and you all are still married.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.412
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 years married.

08:00.552 --> 08:01.233
[Tom Turbeville]: How about that?

08:01.333 --> 08:04.458
[Tom Turbeville]: You came back, I believe, to Moody Air Force Base.

08:04.959 --> 08:08.584
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about the MAPS program, Military Assisting PAC.

08:08.925 --> 08:10.928
[Tom Turbeville]: This is a very interesting part of your career.

08:11.043 --> 08:20.256
[SPEAKER_00]: After flying F-100s in Germany, I came back to our training command, and I was able to get into what they called a MAP pilot training program.

08:21.297 --> 08:24.161
[SPEAKER_00]: MAP stands for Military Assistance Pact.

08:24.181 --> 08:39.042
[SPEAKER_00]: We train pilots from 26 different nations, and supposedly all friendly nations, although I can think of about three or four of those countries that pilots went back and flew MiGs.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.928
[SPEAKER_00]: And but the majority of our students were Vietnamese.

08:46.028 --> 08:54.740
[SPEAKER_00]: I started this in 1961 and hardly anybody else outside of the military knew what Vietnam was in those days.

08:56.182 --> 09:00.388
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed in the squadron almost five years and it was one of the more rewarding

09:00.875 --> 09:07.143
[SPEAKER_00]: tours that I flew, even though I was training in a propeller-driven trainer, the T-28.

09:08.104 --> 09:11.628
[SPEAKER_00]: But I felt like I was achieving something worthwhile.

09:11.848 --> 09:18.717
[Tom Turbeville]: So in the early 60s, you became very familiar with the South Vietnamese people, with the military.

09:18.937 --> 09:23.102
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way the insurgency was going in Vietnam.

09:23.302 --> 09:30.513
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, before really any of the general public really was really aware about the South Vietnamese or what their struggles were, what was about to happen.

09:30.533 --> 09:31.134
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.155
[Tom Turbeville]: Obviously.

09:32.195 --> 09:34.559
[Tom Turbeville]: But then later on, you were deployed to Vietnam.

09:34.579 --> 09:35.200
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.608
[Tom Turbeville]: And you thought you were going to probably be going out of country, but it turns out you were assigned to end country.

09:40.628 --> 09:41.429
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a wish.

09:41.449 --> 09:44.795
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through F-4 transition at Davis-Monthan.

09:44.995 --> 09:46.457
[SPEAKER_00]: I had volunteered for Vietnam.

09:46.808 --> 09:53.056
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I had hoped was to go to either U-Bahn or U-Dorn in Thailand.

09:53.257 --> 10:01.208
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the ones that went out and chased pigs and supported the, also bombed over North Vietnam.

10:01.808 --> 10:08.918
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the luck of the draw, the Air Force decided they wanted me to go in-country to Cam Ranh Bay.

10:08.938 --> 10:15.567
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 12th Tech Fighter Wing was the F-4, well, they had two F-4

10:15.783 --> 10:18.387
[SPEAKER_00]: wings, the other was at Da Nang.

10:18.407 --> 10:28.923
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did missions in country and luck was such that I never went out country.

10:28.943 --> 10:32.188
[SPEAKER_00]: I never went to mission in the north.

10:32.337 --> 10:33.058
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

10:33.078 --> 10:35.081
[Tom Turbeville]: So your day-to-day job was to fly the fighters.

10:35.823 --> 10:36.403
[Tom Turbeville]: Exactly.

10:36.644 --> 10:48.943
[Tom Turbeville]: And you said that in combat situations, you didn't have what you would describe as many terrifying moments, but you described one terrifying moment that actually happened that wasn't in a combat situation.

10:48.963 --> 10:49.484
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.

10:49.985 --> 10:59.560
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent about a month or so in Korea after the North Koreans had hijacked the...

11:00.063 --> 11:02.466
[SPEAKER_00]: our intelligence ship, the Pueblo.

11:02.486 --> 11:08.594
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Air Force sent a couple of wings from the States and had a squadron up from Vietnam.

11:09.455 --> 11:15.964
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on, our mission was air defense with the F-4C.

11:16.545 --> 11:27.960
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were loaded with four Sidewinder missiles, four Sparrow missiles, and a gun pod with 1,100 rounds of 20 millimeter

11:28.565 --> 11:30.647
[SPEAKER_00]: ammunition for the Gatling gun underneath.

11:31.408 --> 11:32.929
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were loaded for bear.

11:34.190 --> 11:38.274
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're talking about, the mission that just terrified me.

11:41.657 --> 11:49.284
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what it was, I actually woke up from a scramble passing through 5,000 feet.

11:49.304 --> 11:52.527
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently I was in an alpha state or something, but I do not remember.

11:52.547 --> 11:53.668
[Tom Turbeville]: You've been woken up in the middle of the night.

11:53.868 --> 11:54.509
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of the night.

11:54.529 --> 11:55.670
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 3 o'clock, 3 a.m.

11:55.690 --> 11:56.110
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.271
[SPEAKER_00]: I was from a dead sleep.

11:57.511 --> 11:58.352
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't remember

11:58.687 --> 12:06.960
[SPEAKER_00]: the klaxon horn waking me up or putting my boots, lacing my boots up or zipping them up and running out the airplane, starting it up.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.622
[SPEAKER_00]: I backseated all the radio works.

12:10.024 --> 12:23.905
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was the flight leader, so I had a flight and we were in the middle of the night growing up and I just became conscious of it all at about 5,000 feet and that just terrified me, I thought.

12:23.925 --> 12:25.387
[Tom Turbeville]: I would imagine so.

12:25.407 --> 12:27.090
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything by rote memory.

12:27.627 --> 12:28.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently did everything right.

12:30.599 --> 12:32.265
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else my backseater would have gotten on me.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.490
[Tom Turbeville]: You're glad it only happened once.

12:33.832 --> 12:38.751
[Tom Turbeville]: Speaking of backseater, I know in Vietnam you wanted to talk about a friend named Tom Burge.

12:38.798 --> 12:39.639
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

12:39.699 --> 12:43.084
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Burge, I trained with at Davis-Monthan.

12:43.124 --> 12:45.487
[SPEAKER_00]: He was my assigned backseater.

12:45.507 --> 12:48.451
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he was a young pilot right out of pilot school.

12:48.892 --> 12:55.962
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the backseaters in F-4s at the time in Vietnam were pilots rather than radar observers.

12:56.763 --> 13:00.729
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I flew most of my missions in Vietnam with Tom.

13:00.749 --> 13:04.654
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I left, I put in about two-thirds of a tour

13:05.056 --> 13:14.509
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cameran Bay, and then they reassigned me to Ton Sanute to be in-country briefing officer for General Brown, the commanding general.

13:14.529 --> 13:22.359
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, at the time, Cameran Bay was the flight commander, and I relinquished my flight to my assistant flight commander.

13:22.880 --> 13:28.928
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Burge was the best backseater in the flight, so he took over my backseater.

13:28.948 --> 13:34.455
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, unfortunately, were killed in a tragic accident on a night scramble at night.

13:35.077 --> 13:38.784
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he didn't make it back.

13:39.084 --> 13:47.439
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often think about Tom and he was a fine young man.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.301
[Tom Turbeville]: Well, I know you do.

13:48.321 --> 13:50.064
[Tom Turbeville]: And we salute his service also.

13:50.525 --> 13:54.612
[Tom Turbeville]: You were talking about flying and sort of the thrills of flying.

13:54.632 --> 13:56.275
[Tom Turbeville]: And I remember you were telling me about

13:56.609 --> 14:05.061
[Tom Turbeville]: taking off in these fighters when they were full load and full heavy and sort of a method of taking off that I found somewhat unbelievable, but I'm going to let you tell the story.

14:05.382 --> 14:26.413
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, normally every takeoff ever made in the F-4, even loaded with weapons in Vietnam, the normal technique was to take the stick and put it all the way back against the seat and hold it there and put the power up to full power and go into afterburner.

14:26.596 --> 14:36.487
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you got to the nose wheel liftoff speed, which is around 145, 150, and those would just come up and it would fly off just like a piper cut.

14:37.728 --> 14:55.708
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one mission when the Khe Sanh battle, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was pretty hot, where the North Vietnamese had put in a bunch of cannons, guns on the reverse slope.

14:56.161 --> 15:00.527
[SPEAKER_00]: of a mountain northeast of the Kaysan airstrip.

15:01.349 --> 15:10.161
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not only shooting across the top of the mountain at the airstrip, but they're also using some for anti-aircraft shooting at aircraft.

15:10.181 --> 15:14.227
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted to go up there with a maximum load, they told us.

15:14.488 --> 15:23.080
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the briefing, they said, well, because you're going to have 12 750-pound bombs loaded on this F-4,

15:24.646 --> 15:50.670
[SPEAKER_00]: center of gravity is going to be a little bit too far forward and by the way it's over gross the airplane but that's okay during combat you don't bother with things like that and they said the airplane won't take off and that's an issue after we survived the shock they said what you have to do is leave the stick in neutral so that the

15:51.089 --> 16:01.371
[SPEAKER_00]: The stabilator or the elevator is in neutral and thus the least amount of drag in the burner.

16:01.551 --> 16:11.612
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get to 153 knots, take the stick and bang it against the instrument panel and back against the seat and hold it there.

16:12.284 --> 16:25.517
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that this puts the nose down and depresses the nose gear strut and then it rebounds up to an angle of attack where you can take off and we took off.

16:25.953 --> 16:28.475
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat there and said, hmm, mentally, yes, sir.

16:29.957 --> 16:31.278
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all worked.

16:31.298 --> 16:32.820
[Tom Turbeville]: It worked just like they said that it would.

16:32.840 --> 16:33.340
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it did.

16:33.761 --> 16:39.266
[Tom Turbeville]: I want to go to some photographs right now that Major Burns has supplied for us here.

16:39.846 --> 16:44.791
[Tom Turbeville]: These are photographs that come from his home, and I'm going to let him talk about them as they come on the screen.

16:44.811 --> 16:45.652
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about this picture.

16:45.692 --> 16:49.155
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was the airplane that had my name on it, and Tom Burns.

16:49.436 --> 16:51.758
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the name was on the other side, but...

16:52.312 --> 16:56.363
[SPEAKER_00]: I just failed to get a picture with our names on it.

16:57.266 --> 17:07.333
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the armament crew and they had just finished arming the aircraft and to go on the mission we had arrived out at the airplane ready to go on another mission.

17:07.803 --> 17:08.985
[Tom Turbeville]: Now, is that the Phantom II?

17:09.145 --> 17:11.168
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the F-4 Phantom II.

17:11.388 --> 17:12.069
[SPEAKER_00]: F-4 Phantom II.

17:12.249 --> 17:12.530
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.873
[Tom Turbeville]: Let's go on to the next photograph.

17:14.893 --> 17:15.293
[Tom Turbeville]: There you are.

17:15.313 --> 17:16.135
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a picture of me.

17:16.155 --> 17:19.579
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a pretty nice handlebar mustache.

17:19.679 --> 17:20.501
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a stache there, yeah.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.844
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a nice fighter pilot's mustache.

17:22.864 --> 17:24.446
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a funny story about that.

17:25.467 --> 17:35.041
[SPEAKER_00]: I was squadron commander, and just about everybody in the 12th wing, I guess, in the hierarchy tolerated but didn't really like mustaches on the pilots.

17:35.241 --> 17:36.162
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.

17:36.182 --> 17:36.763
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

17:37.604 --> 17:43.710
[SPEAKER_00]: General Ryan, who I believe was the commander of PACAF at the time, was visiting Cameron Bay.

17:43.770 --> 17:48.855
[SPEAKER_00]: And my squadron commander called me in and said, Burns, you go up the tower and you stay there the whole time the journal's up there.

17:49.376 --> 17:55.442
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew exactly what he was talking about because General Ryan wasn't about to climb all those stairs up the top of the tower and see me with a mustache.

17:56.923 --> 17:58.024
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got away with it.

17:58.044 --> 17:58.385
[Tom Turbeville]: Indeed.

17:59.085 --> 18:00.066
[Tom Turbeville]: Okay, let's move on.

18:00.487 --> 18:06.733
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a painting that I had commissioned of a painter that

18:06.713 --> 18:09.338
[SPEAKER_00]: paints aviation railed in sight.

18:09.899 --> 18:15.549
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him about it and gave him some pictures of F4s, of KC-135s.

18:16.190 --> 18:20.959
[SPEAKER_00]: After we took off with that load of 12 700 pound bombs,

18:21.293 --> 18:23.716
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really have enough fuel to get up to caisson.

18:25.438 --> 18:29.022
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to hit the tanker and get refueled on the way up there.

18:29.362 --> 18:31.264
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that depicts.

18:32.065 --> 18:38.012
[SPEAKER_00]: 552 in my airplanes, the one sitting up there on the wing waiting to get refueled.

18:38.392 --> 18:39.694
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

18:39.714 --> 18:40.615
[Tom Turbeville]: Go on to the next picture.

18:40.855 --> 18:43.779
[Tom Turbeville]: You have a collection in your home of pistols.

18:43.799 --> 18:46.862
[Tom Turbeville]: We're going to talk about this later on, but go ahead and tell us what we're looking at.

18:46.943 --> 18:53.533
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 50s and 60s, I was quite active in gun collecting.

18:53.833 --> 19:07.153
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those guns used to be just, you know, in pawn shops and gun shops where I mostly bought them.

19:07.173 --> 19:12.681
[SPEAKER_00]: And people had them for bureau drawer guns and so forth.

19:13.268 --> 19:15.791
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were very cheap.

19:16.532 --> 19:32.053
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1968, when they had the riots in California, virtually all guns, handguns, disappeared, useful handguns, disappeared from gunshots.

19:32.033 --> 19:35.879
[SPEAKER_00]: When they came back, they were all regarded as collector's items.

19:36.340 --> 19:51.105
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had already put together a complete representative sample of all of the .38 ACP, .38 caliber automatics that Colt made from 1900 to about 1928.

19:51.372 --> 19:52.173
[Tom Turbeville]: That's quite a collection.

19:52.193 --> 19:53.716
[Tom Turbeville]: A lot of veterans have shadow boxes.

19:53.736 --> 19:54.918
[Tom Turbeville]: That's quite a shadow box.

19:55.018 --> 19:57.321
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all those medals were shooting medals.

19:57.361 --> 19:58.223
[Tom Turbeville]: Shooting medals, right.

19:58.884 --> 19:59.144
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

19:59.405 --> 20:01.768
[Tom Turbeville]: It's an amazing thing that I got to see in your home.

20:02.049 --> 20:04.092
[Tom Turbeville]: We've got one more picture of your family.

20:04.252 --> 20:05.194
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's my family.

20:05.755 --> 20:06.796
[Tom Turbeville]: That's you and your wife.

20:06.816 --> 20:08.900
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I and my son and daughter-in-law.

20:09.100 --> 20:14.508
[SPEAKER_00]: My son is assistant district attorney in Dallas County.

20:14.649 --> 20:16.331
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been, I think, 19 years now.

20:16.351 --> 20:16.772
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Fred.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.849
[Tom Turbeville]: And your daughter-in-law?

20:18.869 --> 20:19.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Lord Tracy.

20:19.470 --> 20:20.091
[Tom Turbeville]: That's right.

20:20.111 --> 20:26.936
[Tom Turbeville]: And you and I had an older son, Glenn, who unfortunately you lost in an accident.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.459
[Tom Turbeville]: But that's your family.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.920
[Tom Turbeville]: That was taken just a few years ago.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.122
[Tom Turbeville]: So fine-looking family there.

20:33.382 --> 20:36.104
[Tom Turbeville]: I want to go to live right here in our studio now.

20:36.124 --> 20:39.688
[Tom Turbeville]: And you are a collector of models of the planes that you have flown.

20:40.268 --> 20:42.570
[Tom Turbeville]: Show us a little bit what we're looking at right here.

20:42.590 --> 20:46.033
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just about every pilot.

20:46.233 --> 20:50.899
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Air Force has models of airplanes included.

20:51.199 --> 20:52.361
[Tom Turbeville]: This is the F-100.

20:52.381 --> 20:55.345
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the first one that I flew.

20:55.385 --> 20:55.865
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the F-86F.

20:55.885 --> 20:58.569
[Tom Turbeville]: That's the one on the left as you're looking at the screen.

20:58.609 --> 20:59.690
[Tom Turbeville]: Go ahead and pull it back in there.

20:59.710 --> 21:00.111
[Tom Turbeville]: There we go.

21:00.711 --> 21:03.215
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the next one, the F-100.

21:03.295 --> 21:07.220
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the purists who look at this, they'll see that's an F-100D.

21:07.480 --> 21:12.226
[SPEAKER_00]: I did fly some of the D, but most of my time was in the C model.

21:12.987 --> 21:16.071
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after my stint training,

21:16.456 --> 21:21.123
[SPEAKER_00]: Allied pilots, I went to F-4's transition.

21:21.163 --> 21:23.746
[SPEAKER_00]: I flew the C model, and this is the F-4.

21:24.247 --> 21:30.736
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flew that in Vietnam, and subsequent assignment to Europe.

21:30.796 --> 21:32.078
[SPEAKER_00]: That one right there.

21:32.098 --> 21:36.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent assignment to Europe, I flew the D model and the E model.

21:37.125 --> 21:37.345
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

21:38.166 --> 21:42.953
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, I had an opportunity while I was at Tan Sanute,

21:43.237 --> 22:01.644
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had so many friends in the Vietnamese Air Force, and there were probably eight to ten people that I had trained in the one jet squadron in Vietnam, 622 squadron, and they were flying the F-5 Freedom Fighter.

22:02.405 --> 22:06.932
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a model that has the Vietnamese markings on it just exactly like it flew.

22:07.199 --> 22:09.413
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let me fly the airplane.

22:09.433 --> 22:13.277
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they had 19 combat sorties with the VNAF.

22:13.763 --> 22:15.326
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great fun.

22:15.406 --> 22:18.611
[SPEAKER_00]: I had great regard for the Vietnamese pilots.

22:18.631 --> 22:21.836
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm a fan of the models, and these are really something.

22:22.217 --> 22:26.504
[Tom Turbeville]: After Vietnam, you actually took another tour of Europe, of Germany.

22:26.544 --> 22:27.766
[Tom Turbeville]: You went back to Amsterdam.

22:27.786 --> 22:30.089
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a concurrent tour back over to Europe.

22:30.911 --> 22:33.715
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked Europe, and the family got to go both times.

22:33.735 --> 22:39.805
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had two kids by that time I got over there, and they thrived on Europe.

22:39.785 --> 22:40.907
[Tom Turbeville]: Indeed.

22:40.967 --> 22:45.577
[Tom Turbeville]: You came back to Texas A&M, and I know, and you taught there for seven or eight years.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.803
[Tom Turbeville]: You finally retired from the Air Force after 21 years.

22:48.983 --> 22:54.074
[SPEAKER_00]: I retired in 1973 after 20 years of flying.

22:54.775 --> 22:59.785
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to admit that my sole motivation in the Air Force was flying.

23:00.085 --> 23:02.630
[SPEAKER_00]: and fighters if possible.

23:02.930 --> 23:12.047
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 20 years, the Air Force had a policy where all people who had been flying 20 years, quote unquote, didn't need to fly anymore.

23:12.087 --> 23:17.537
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was concurrent with my

23:17.787 --> 23:19.269
[SPEAKER_00]: completion of my overseas tour.

23:19.669 --> 23:24.335
[SPEAKER_00]: Just couldn't see coming back to the States, sitting at some desk and watching everybody fly.

23:24.415 --> 23:28.079
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to retire 21 years and did.

23:28.640 --> 23:33.525
[Tom Turbeville]: Came back to Texas A&M, worked in the executive development office and taught management for a while.

23:33.585 --> 23:37.390
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught management for a couple of semesters, something like that.

23:38.852 --> 23:46.140
[SPEAKER_00]: I had earned a master's degree from USC while I was in the Air Force and was then qualified to teach it.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.425
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed with A&M about eight years, I guess.

23:49.445 --> 23:54.733
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my wife and I owned a health food store.

23:54.753 --> 23:58.979
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides that, I worked for Yef Hunt for about three years.

23:58.999 --> 24:10.896
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where I got the idea, but during my career, I always had the idea in my mind that I would like to retire at age 55.

24:11.365 --> 24:15.252
[SPEAKER_00]: And we scrimped and saved and invested and were able to do it.

24:15.432 --> 24:15.913
[Tom Turbeville]: Able to do it.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.075
[Tom Turbeville]: But I want to get it.

24:17.095 --> 24:18.337
[Tom Turbeville]: We've only got about three minutes left.

24:18.397 --> 24:20.581
[Tom Turbeville]: And I want to talk about the A&M pistol team.

24:21.002 --> 24:24.528
[Tom Turbeville]: Because you've been the coach of the pistol team for several years.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.654
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably wearing their shirt right now.

24:27.834 --> 24:32.122
[SPEAKER_00]: During the 60s, I had to go out and qualify with a pistol every year.

24:32.483 --> 24:35.027
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hurt my pride because of it.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.285
[SPEAKER_00]: pistol collection I had that I couldn't shoot the .45 well.

24:38.745 --> 24:44.432
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a guy that was on the pistol team at Randolph and my squadron taught me how to shoot a .45.

24:45.213 --> 24:48.617
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently showed him some talent and asked me to go on the pistol team.

24:49.057 --> 24:53.722
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was on the pistol team at Randolph for several years and on Davis-Monthan several years.

24:54.563 --> 24:57.486
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't great, but I was almost.

24:59.469 --> 25:05.115
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I was good enough where after

25:05.703 --> 25:11.864
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam and United States and Europe, which was a total of about six years.

25:12.025 --> 25:12.446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.

25:12.466 --> 25:13.992
[SPEAKER_00]: Came back and I was kind of over the hill.

25:14.774 --> 25:18.447
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some more competing.

25:19.287 --> 25:23.853
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did volunteer and started coaching.

25:24.073 --> 25:26.356
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had to start up a team that had elapsed.

25:26.576 --> 25:28.298
[SPEAKER_00]: I started up the pistol team in 1974.

25:28.539 --> 25:31.102
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been coaching it ever since.

25:31.983 --> 25:35.988
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy coaching every bit as much as I did competing.

25:36.409 --> 25:40.133
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really a lot of fun.

25:41.595 --> 25:46.982
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, I coached both the university team and the ROTC pistol team.

25:47.300 --> 25:51.405
[SPEAKER_00]: The ROTC pistol team won the National ROTC Pistol Championships.

25:51.585 --> 25:52.126
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago.

25:52.146 --> 25:52.766
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite proud of that.

25:52.787 --> 25:54.388
[Tom Turbeville]: And finished second last year, is that right?

25:54.469 --> 25:55.289
[SPEAKER_00]: Second last year.

25:55.330 --> 25:55.810
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.833
[Tom Turbeville]: But it's a whole new year now.

25:57.853 --> 25:58.573
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole new year.

25:58.593 --> 26:00.115
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to win it again.

26:00.135 --> 26:04.741
[Tom Turbeville]: There's about a dozen on each team, I think you said, on the university team and the ROTC team.

26:05.181 --> 26:08.485
[Tom Turbeville]: And they compete against other schools.

26:08.545 --> 26:10.167
[Tom Turbeville]: It's not a NCAA sport per se.

26:10.187 --> 26:13.691
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we go to the National Collegiate Pistol Championships.

26:14.372 --> 26:15.113
[SPEAKER_00]: They...

26:15.548 --> 26:18.071
[SPEAKER_00]: invite the top 10 teams in the nation.

26:18.552 --> 26:26.001
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in the top 10 teams in the nation 26, I know, 24 out of the last 26 years that they've had the national championship.

26:26.722 --> 26:31.909
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finished, the best we've finished is third.

26:32.629 --> 26:37.375
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was quite proud of our ROTC team winning it.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.257
[Tom Turbeville]: That was two years ago.

26:38.317 --> 26:39.638
[Tom Turbeville]: That was two years ago.

26:39.879 --> 26:41.901
[Tom Turbeville]: And I believe you're hosting an event?

26:41.921 --> 26:44.384
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we'll have a match in about three weeks.

26:44.504 --> 26:44.965
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

26:45.586 --> 26:51.107
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationals this year, instead of being at Fort Benning, it's going to be at West Point.

26:51.228 --> 26:55.123
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of our team members are anxious to go up and

26:55.812 --> 26:56.673
[SPEAKER_00]: See West Point.

26:56.693 --> 26:58.115
[Tom Turbeville]: Well, we got him in football this past year.

26:58.135 --> 26:59.858
[Tom Turbeville]: We'll get him in pistol also.

26:59.878 --> 27:01.019
[Tom Turbeville]: Thank you very much for your service.

27:01.039 --> 27:02.161
[Tom Turbeville]: We're out of time and I appreciate it.

27:02.181 --> 27:02.641
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.

27:02.741 --> 27:03.202
[Tom Turbeville]: Major Burns.

27:03.683 --> 27:07.949
[Tom Turbeville]: As a pilot in Vietnam, Curt Burns could hardly stand being inactive.

27:08.009 --> 27:13.716
[Tom Turbeville]: He flew four or five days a week, but that was three or four days a week too few for his taste.

27:13.736 --> 27:19.785
[Tom Turbeville]: And now his passion is the A&M pistol team, his family, trying to help the pistol team win another national title.

27:20.265 --> 27:23.710
[Tom Turbeville]: We salute Major Curtis Burns for his service as we salute all veterans.

27:24.044 --> 27:25.105
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm Tom Turberville.

27:25.145 --> 27:49.191
[Tom Turbeville]: Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:50.977 --> 27:55.823
you
