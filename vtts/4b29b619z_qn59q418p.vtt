00:12.755 --> 00:35.708
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello

00:12.755 --> 00:35.708
[SPEAKER_01]: and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbyville. Meet Major Kurt Burns, an airman with plenty of passion and 
little fear. Texas A&M class of 1952. He grew up in a home located about where G. Raleigh White Coliseum stands today.

00:49.979 --> 01:02.292
[SPEAKER_01]: This Aggie was a proud flyer who piloted five different jet fighters during his service in Europe and then Vietnam in all 
nearly 5,000 hours of flying time in more than 20 years as an Air Force pilot. He still serves the school he loved so

01:02.312 --> 01:04.475
[SPEAKER_01]: dearly. Today, as coach of the A&M pistol team, meet the multi-talented Kurt Burns of Bryan. Major Burns, it's a 
pleasure to have you here. I want to talk first about growing up on the Texas A&M campus in the mid to late 30s. That must

01:17.252 --> 01:18.854
[SPEAKER_01]: have been quite an experience. That was back when they had a pretty good football team even back then. Won a national 
championship two years later and you look through the knothole to watch John Kimbrough practice and play, right?

01:30.650 --> 01:42.381
[SPEAKER_00]: During the time that the team was practicing, playing, every day during football season after school, I was in Antium 
Consolidated. Right. And I would go over to the practice field and watch them practice. Right. And I saw all the home

01:48.347 --> 01:50.529
[SPEAKER_00]: games. And as a matter of fact, I saw all the home games probably from 1937 until...

01:59.017 --> 02:04.828
[SPEAKER_00]: I left in 1952 and then after I came back in 1972. The campus was quite a bit different then. Kyle Field was just a small 
one-stack stadium and actually you lived on campus because your father was a professor at the time and most of the

02:07.011 --> 02:16.970
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty lived on campus at that time, right? I believe it was department heads and deans and higher. And my father had 
been head of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology for the College of, or rather at that time, the School of

02:22.760 --> 02:32.349
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterinary Medicine. Right. You were born in Bryan. You went to A&M Consolidated your freshman year in high school, 
then went to Stephen F. Austin, which is now Bryan High later on, and went on to Texas A&M, graduated in 1952, and that's

02:33.810 --> 02:49.865
[SPEAKER_01]: about the time the Korean War was going on, so it didn't take long for you to go into active service with the Air Force. Sort 
of take us through that time. Well, when I graduated, I was an Air Force officer with TC and had thoughts about being a

02:51.532 --> 03:05.169
[SPEAKER_00]: pilot that were generated generally during World War II when I was following the war very closely. And I had pictures of 
airplanes all over my wall. in my room right and uh so i came on active duty 52 it took them uh the air force about a year to get

03:08.120 --> 03:32.203
[SPEAKER_00]: me into a class in uh flying school uh at the time i was at this hardship position or our location i was stationed at palm 
beach international airport they had a uh military air transport service training base down there they trained pilots

03:32.183 --> 03:54.360
[SPEAKER_00]: for c124s and c97s and sa16s and i'd go scrounge rides with pilots as often as i could get off from my work right anyway uh 
when i then i got into flying school and went to bartow airbase which is a primary contract field in Bartow, Florida,

03:54.897 --> 04:02.008
[SPEAKER_00]: about in the middle of the state, and flew the T6G. I love the T6. It was, I thought, an outstanding training plane. I 
always thought if a person could learn to fly a master of the T6, he'd fly anything. And after that, I

04:11.904 --> 04:18.475
[SPEAKER_00]: was relatively high up in my class and got my choice and I chose Brian for a basic going to jets. Right. You told me that was 
interesting. You said that the class, the top half of the class got to go to jets and the bottom half of the class went to

04:25.740 --> 04:31.070
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed wings. That's true, except for one person in there who had been a SAC navigator in the Strategic Air Command. His 
goal was to go to multi-engine training and get into the, at that time, very new, KC-135s, put in his normal, or his

04:39.380 --> 04:52.033
[SPEAKER_00]: required commitment, go to work for airlines. And nothing wrong with that. He did. He achieved that. But everybody 
else, when the, I can say 14 of the top 30 went to jet bases. Indeed. I got the chance to come back here to Bryan and do my

05:05.047 --> 05:08.451
[SPEAKER_00]: training. Yeah, that was in the early 50s, I guess. You graduated. I graduated. That was from September of 53 until 
September of 54. Right, when you finished flying school. Like we said in the outset, you flew, I think, five different

05:19.222 --> 05:22.765
[SPEAKER_01]: jet fighters. Let's talk about the F-86 because we're going to see a model of that. That was your first and that was your 
favorite. That was my favorite airplane, my favorite fighter of any. It was very, I called it a pussycat. You could get in

05:35.841 --> 05:36.622
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble. Right. If you mishandled the airplane, you could get in real trouble. Right. If you flew it like a fighter ought 
to be flown, it was a very forgiving airplane. Had relatively few emergencies in the airplane. A couple of them, well, I

05:50.765 --> 05:55.292
[SPEAKER_00]: had smoked in the cockpit that I coped with one time every time. And another time I had trouble getting the nose gear down, 
but I got I held the emergency, landed out, and got it landed okay. But I was fortunate after flying school to have my

06:05.344 --> 06:13.355
[SPEAKER_00]: choice high enough in the class to where I was able to choose F-86. It was a choice assignment, the choicest assignment 
from basic at the time. Let's move on. I know later on you took your first of what would be two tours of Germany. Let's talk

06:23.710 --> 06:27.315
[SPEAKER_01]: about the first time that you went to Ramstein in Germany. I had been instructing F-86s at Williams Air Force Base in 
Arizona, and I got this really plumb of an assignment to the 53rd Fighter Day Squadron in what is now Ramstein Air Base,

06:27.397 --> 06:40.509
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany. In those days, Fighter Day was air defense, and that was the pinnacle of a fighter pilot's assignment. And I had 
about half the tour there at Ramstein in air defense as day fighter pilot in the F-100C. The F-100C was probably the best

06:59.720 --> 07:06.635
[SPEAKER_00]: day fighter they had at that time. And then they I reconfigured the whole wing including our squadron as a nuclear strike 
to the nuclear strike mission and I spent the last half of my tour in the 53rd basically training for and sitting alert on

07:12.385 --> 07:32.841
[SPEAKER_00]: atomic bomb and with task for tactical missions in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and I had one target was in the Soviet 
Union. I want to backtrack just a little bit back to when you were at Texas A&M and a senior in 1952, right at Eastern 52,

07:45.629 --> 07:55.044
[SPEAKER_01]: before you graduated, you married your wife, Ann. Yes. And a special moment in your life, and you all are still married. 
54 years married. How about that? You came back, I believe, to Moody Air Force Base. Talk about the MAPS program,

08:04.979 --> 08:08.564
[SPEAKER_01]: Military Assisting PAC. This is a very interesting part of your career. After flying F-100s in Germany, I came back to 
our training command, and I was able to get into what they called a MAP pilot training program. MAP stands for Military

08:21.297 --> 08:23.460
[SPEAKER_00]: Assistance Pact. We train pilots from 26 different nations, and supposedly all friendly nations, although I can think 
of about three or four of those countries that pilots went back and flew MiGs. And but the majority of our students were

08:40.000 --> 08:46.289
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnamese. I started this in 1961 and hardly anybody else outside of the military knew what Vietnam was in those days. I 
stayed in the squadron almost five years and it was one of the more rewarding tours that I flew, even though I was training

09:00.875 --> 09:07.143
[SPEAKER_00]: in a propeller-driven trainer, the T-28. But I felt like I was achieving something worthwhile. So in the early 60s, you 
became very familiar with the South Vietnamese people, with the military. And the way the insurgency was going in

09:18.917 --> 09:23.102
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam. Right, before really any of the general public really was really aware about the South Vietnamese or what 
their struggles were, what was about to happen. True. Obviously. But then later on, you were deployed to Vietnam. Yes.

09:35.380 --> 09:40.468
[SPEAKER_01]: And you thought you were going to probably be going out of country, but it turns out you were assigned to end country. That 
was just a wish. I went through F-4 transition at Davis-Monthan. I had volunteered for Vietnam. And what I had hoped was

09:46.808 --> 09:53.016
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to either U-Bahn or U-Dorn in Thailand. And they were the ones that went out and chased pigs and supported the, also 
bombed over North Vietnam. But as the luck of the draw, the Air Force decided they wanted me to go in-country to Cam Ranh

10:01.808 --> 10:07.837
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay. And the 12th Tech Fighter Wing was the F-4, well, they had two F-4 wings, the other was at Da Nang. But we did missions 
in country and luck was such that I never went out country. I never went to mission in the north. Right. So your day-to-day

10:33.078 --> 10:35.081
[SPEAKER_01]: job was to fly the fighters. Exactly. And you said that in combat situations, you didn't have what you would describe as 
many terrifying moments, but you described one terrifying moment that actually happened that wasn't in a combat

10:36.664 --> 10:48.763
[SPEAKER_01]: situation. That's true. I spent about a month or so in Korea after the North Koreans had hijacked the... our 
intelligence ship, the Pueblo. And the Air Force sent a couple of wings from the States and had a squadron up from

11:02.486 --> 11:08.594
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam. And I was on, our mission was air defense with the F-4C. And we were loaded with four Sidewinder missiles, four 
Sparrow missiles, and a gun pod with 1,100 rounds of 20 millimeter ammunition for the Gatling gun underneath. So we were

11:31.408 --> 11:32.949
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded for bear. But what you're talking about, the mission that just terrified me.

11:41.657 --> 11:48.663
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what it was, I actually woke up from a scramble passing through 5,000 feet. Apparently I was in an alpha state or 
something, but I do not remember. You've been woken up in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night. It was 3

11:54.549 --> 11:55.670
[SPEAKER_00]: o'clock, 3 a.m. in the morning. I was from a dead sleep. I didn't remember the klaxon horn waking me up or putting my boots, 
lacing my boots up or zipping them up and running out the airplane, starting it up. I backseated all the radio works. But I

12:10.024 --> 12:23.925
[SPEAKER_00]: was the flight leader, so I had a flight and we were in the middle of the night growing up and I just became conscious of it 
all at about 5,000 feet and that just terrified me, I thought. I would imagine so. Everything by rote memory. Apparently

12:27.627 --> 12:28.631
[SPEAKER_00]: did everything right. Or else my backseater would have gotten on me. You're glad it only happened once. Speaking of 
backseater, I know in Vietnam you wanted to talk about a friend named Tom Burge. Yes. Tom Burge, I trained with at

12:39.719 --> 12:43.104
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis-Monthan. He was my assigned backseater. Now, he was a young pilot right out of pilot school. But most of the 
backseaters in F-4s at the time in Vietnam were pilots rather than radar observers. And so I flew most of my missions in

12:56.743 --> 12:59.988
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam with Tom. And after I left, I put in about two-thirds of a tour at Cameran Bay, and then they reassigned me to Ton 
Sanute to be in-country briefing officer for General Brown, the commanding general. And I, at the time, Cameran Bay was

13:14.509 --> 13:22.860
[SPEAKER_00]: the flight commander, and I relinquished my flight to my assistant flight commander. Tom Burge was the best backseater 
in the flight, so he took over my backseater. And they, unfortunately, were killed in a tragic accident on a night

13:28.948 --> 13:34.455
[SPEAKER_00]: scramble at night. And so he didn't make it back. And I often think about Tom and he was a fine young man. Well, I know you do. 
And we salute his service also. You were talking about flying and sort of the thrills of flying. And I remember you were

13:54.652 --> 13:56.275
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me about taking off in these fighters when they were full load and full heavy and sort of a method of taking off 
that I found somewhat unbelievable, but I'm going to let you tell the story. Well, normally every takeoff ever made in

14:05.382 --> 14:26.413
[SPEAKER_00]: the F-4, even loaded with weapons in Vietnam, the normal technique was to take the stick and put it all the way back 
against the seat and hold it there and put the power up to full power and go into afterburner. And when you got to the nose

14:26.596 --> 14:36.467
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel liftoff speed, which is around 145, 150, and those would just come up and it would fly off just like a piper cut. We 
had one mission when the Khe Sanh battle, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was pretty hot, where the North Vietnamese had

14:37.708 --> 14:55.708
[SPEAKER_00]: put in a bunch of cannons, guns on the reverse slope. of a mountain northeast of the Kaysan airstrip. They were not only 
shooting across the top of the mountain at the airstrip, but they're also using some for anti-aircraft shooting at

15:01.349 --> 15:09.480
[SPEAKER_00]: aircraft. So they wanted to go up there with a maximum load, they told us. And during the briefing, they said, well, 
because you're going to have 12 750-pound bombs loaded on this F-4, center of gravity is going to be a little bit too far

15:24.646 --> 15:50.670
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and by the way it's over gross the airplane but that's okay during combat you don't bother with things like that 
and they said the airplane won't take off and that's an issue after we survived the shock they said what you have to do is

15:24.646 --> 15:50.670
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the stick in neutral so that the The stabilator or the elevator is in neutral and thus the least amount of drag in the 
burner. And when you get to 153 knots, take the stick and bang it against the instrument panel and back against the seat

16:01.551 --> 16:11.612
[SPEAKER_00]: and hold it there. And what happens is that this puts the nose down and depresses the nose gear strut and then it rebounds 
up to an angle of attack where you can take off and we took off. We sat there and said, hmm, mentally, yes, sir. But it all

16:29.937 --> 16:31.318
[SPEAKER_00]: worked. It worked just like they said that it would. Just like it did. I want to go to some photographs right now that Major 
Burns has supplied for us here. These are photographs that come from his home, and I'm going to let him talk about them as

16:39.846 --> 16:44.271
[SPEAKER_01]: they come on the screen. Talk about this picture. Well, that was the airplane that had my name on it, and Tom Burns. 
Unfortunately, the name was on the other side, but... I just failed to get a picture with our names on it. This was the

16:57.266 --> 17:07.333
[SPEAKER_00]: armament crew and they had just finished arming the aircraft and to go on the mission we had arrived out at the airplane 
ready to go on another mission. Now, is that the Phantom II? That is the F-4 Phantom II. F-4 Phantom II. Okay. Let's go on to

17:13.231 --> 17:14.873
[SPEAKER_01]: the next photograph. There you are. That's a picture of me. I had a pretty nice handlebar mustache. Quite a stache there, 
yeah. I thought it was a nice fighter pilot's mustache. There's a funny story about that. I was squadron commander, and

17:26.188 --> 17:35.942
[SPEAKER_00]: just about everybody in the 12th wing, I guess, in the hierarchy tolerated but didn't really like mustaches on the 
pilots. Uh-huh. And... General Ryan, who I believe was the commander of PACAF at the time, was visiting Cameron Bay. And

17:43.790 --> 17:48.935
[SPEAKER_00]: my squadron commander called me in and said, Burns, you go up the tower and you stay there the whole time the journal's up 
there. I knew exactly what he was talking about because General Ryan wasn't about to climb all those stairs up the top of

17:49.376 --> 17:55.442
[SPEAKER_00]: the tower and see me with a mustache. So I got away with it. Indeed. Okay, let's move on. This is a painting that I had 
commissioned of a painter that paints aviation railed in sight. And I told him about it and gave him some pictures of F4s,

18:09.899 --> 18:15.569
[SPEAKER_00]: of KC-135s. After we took off with that load of 12 700 pound bombs, We didn't really have enough fuel to get up to caisson. 
So we had to hit the tanker and get refueled on the way up there. And that's what that depicts. 552 in my airplanes, the one

18:32.085 --> 18:38.012
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting up there on the wing waiting to get refueled. Right. Go on to the next picture. You have a collection in your home 
of pistols. We're going to talk about this later on, but go ahead and tell us what we're looking at. Back in the 50s and 60s,

18:46.943 --> 18:53.533
[SPEAKER_00]: I was quite active in gun collecting. And

18:53.813 --> 19:07.073
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those guns used to be just, you know, in pawn shops and gun shops where I mostly bought them. And people had them for 
bureau drawer guns and so forth. and they were very cheap. In 1968, when they had the riots in California, virtually all

19:16.532 --> 19:32.053
[SPEAKER_00]: guns, handguns, disappeared, useful handguns, disappeared from gunshots.

19:32.033 --> 19:35.899
[SPEAKER_00]: When they came back, they were all regarded as collector's items. But I had already put together a complete 
representative sample of all of the .38 ACP, .38 caliber automatics that Colt made from 1900 to about 1928. That's quite

19:51.372 --> 19:52.173
[SPEAKER_01]: a collection. A lot of veterans have shadow boxes. That's quite a shadow box. Well, all those medals were shooting 
medals. Shooting medals, right. Right. It's an amazing thing that I got to see in your home. We've got one more picture of

20:02.069 --> 20:04.112
[SPEAKER_01]: your family. Oh, it's my family. That's you and your wife. My wife and I and my son and daughter-in-law. My son is 
assistant district attorney in Dallas County. It has been, I think, 19 years now. That's Fred. And your

20:17.208 --> 20:18.849
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter-in-law? Lord Tracy. That's right. And you and I had an older son, Glenn, who unfortunately you lost in an 
accident. But that's your family. That was taken just a few years ago. So fine-looking family there. I want to go to live

20:33.362 --> 20:36.064
[SPEAKER_01]: right here in our studio now. And you are a collector of models of the planes that you have flown. Show us a little bit what 
we're looking at right here. These are just about every pilot. and the Air Force has models of airplanes included. This

20:51.219 --> 20:52.361
[SPEAKER_01]: is the F-100. This one is the first one that I flew. That's the F-86F. That's the one on the left as you're looking at the 
screen. Go ahead and pull it back in there. There we go. And this was the next one, the F-100. Now, for the purists who look

21:03.295 --> 21:07.220
[SPEAKER_00]: at this, they'll see that's an F-100D. I did fly some of the D, but most of my time was in the C model. And then after my stint 
training, Allied pilots, I went to F-4's transition. I flew the C model, and this is the F-4. And I flew that in Vietnam,

21:25.148 --> 21:30.776
[SPEAKER_00]: and subsequent assignment to Europe. That one right there. Subsequent assignment to Europe, I flew the D model and the E 
model. Right. And this one, I had an opportunity while I was at Tan Sanute, And I had so many friends in the Vietnamese Air

21:43.237 --> 22:02.085
[SPEAKER_00]: Force, and there were probably eight to ten people that I had trained in the one jet squadron in Vietnam, 622 squadron, 
and they were flying the F-5 Freedom Fighter. And this is a model that has the Vietnamese markings on it just exactly like

22:02.405 --> 22:06.932
[SPEAKER_00]: it flew. And they let me fly the airplane. I think they had 19 combat sorties with the VNAF. That was great fun. I had great 
regard for the Vietnamese pilots. I'm a fan of the models, and these are really something. After Vietnam, you actually

22:22.217 --> 22:26.504
[SPEAKER_01]: took another tour of Europe, of Germany. You went back to Amsterdam. I had a concurrent tour back over to Europe. I liked 
Europe, and the family got to go both times. So I had two kids by that time I got over there, and they thrived on Europe.

22:39.785 --> 22:40.927
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed. You came back to Texas A&M, and I know, and you taught there for seven or eight years. You finally retired from the 
Air Force after 21 years. I retired in 1973 after 20 years of flying. I've got to admit that my sole motivation in the Air

22:54.795 --> 22:59.785
[SPEAKER_00]: Force was flying. and fighters if possible. And after 20 years, the Air Force had a policy where all people who had been 
flying 20 years, quote unquote, didn't need to fly anymore. And so that was concurrent with my completion of my overseas

23:17.787 --> 23:19.269
[SPEAKER_00]: tour. Just couldn't see coming back to the States, sitting at some desk and watching everybody fly. So I was able to 
retire 21 years and did. Came back to Texas A&M, worked in the executive development office and taught management for a

23:28.760 --> 23:33.525
[SPEAKER_01]: while. I taught management for a couple of semesters, something like that. I had earned a master's degree from USC while 
I was in the Air Force and was then qualified to teach it. I stayed with A&M about eight years, I guess. And then my wife and I

23:49.425 --> 23:54.072
[SPEAKER_00]: owned a health food store. And besides that, I worked for Yef Hunt for about three years. I don't know where I got the idea, 
but during my career, I always had the idea in my mind that I would like to retire at age 55. And we scrimped and saved and

24:11.365 --> 24:15.252
[SPEAKER_00]: invested and were able to do it. Able to do it. But I want to get it. We've only got about three minutes left. And I want to 
talk about the A&M pistol team. Because you've been the coach of the pistol team for several years. And you're probably

24:25.350 --> 24:27.634
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing their shirt right now. During the 60s, I had to go out and qualify with a pistol every year. And it hurt my pride 
because of it. pistol collection I had that I couldn't shoot the .45 well. So I got a guy that was on the pistol team at

24:38.785 --> 24:44.712
[SPEAKER_00]: Randolph and my squadron taught me how to shoot a .45. Apparently showed him some talent and asked me to go on the pistol 
team. And so I was on the pistol team at Randolph for several years and on Davis-Monthan several years. And I wasn't

24:54.543 --> 24:57.486
[SPEAKER_00]: great, but I was almost. But anyway, I was good enough where after Vietnam and United States and Europe, which was a total 
of about six years. Yes, sir. Came back and I was kind of over the hill. And I did some more competing. But I did volunteer

25:19.287 --> 25:23.873
[SPEAKER_00]: and started coaching. Actually, I had to start up a team that had elapsed. I started up the pistol team in 1974. And I've 
been coaching it ever since. And I enjoy coaching every bit as much as I did competing. And it is really a lot of fun. Two

25:41.595 --> 25:46.982
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, I coached both the university team and the ROTC pistol team. The ROTC pistol team won the National ROTC Pistol 
Championships. Two years ago. I'm quite proud of that. And finished second last year, is that right? Second last year.

25:55.410 --> 25:55.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Right. But it's a whole new year now. A whole new year. We're going to win it again. There's about a dozen on each team, I 
think you said, on the university team and the ROTC team. And they compete against other schools. It's not a NCAA sport

26:08.565 --> 26:10.167
[SPEAKER_01]: per se. For example, we go to the National Collegiate Pistol Championships. They... invite the top 10 teams in the 
nation. We've been in the top 10 teams in the nation 26, I know, 24 out of the last 26 years that they've had the national

26:18.512 --> 26:26.001
[SPEAKER_00]: championship. And we finished, the best we've finished is third. But I was quite proud of our ROTC team winning it. That 
was two years ago. That was two years ago. And I believe you're hosting an event? Oh, we'll have a match in about three

26:41.921 --> 26:44.384
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks. Right. Nationals this year, instead of being at Fort Benning, it's going to be at West Point. So all of our team 
members are anxious to go up and See West Point. Well, we got him in football this past year. We'll get him in pistol also.

26:59.878 --> 27:01.019
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for your service. We're out of time and I appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Major Burns. As a pilot in 
Vietnam, Curt Burns could hardly stand being inactive. He flew four or five days a week, but that was three or four days a

27:08.029 --> 27:13.716
[SPEAKER_01]: week too few for his taste. And now his passion is the A&M pistol team, his family, trying to help the pistol team win 
another national title. We salute Major Curtis Burns for his service as we salute all veterans. I'm Tom Turberville.

27:25.145 --> 27:49.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:50.977 --> 27:55.823
you
