00:01.260 --> 00:03.020
Okay, Paul, the tape's rolling.

00:03.700 --> 00:10.320
One comment I wanted to make to you, I was going to ask you if you'd seen the Wall Street Journal article that Peter Dubois wrote about.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.040
I've been waiting for it, but I haven't seen it yet.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.460
Do you have any way to get a copy of it?

00:17.940 --> 00:25.180
I think that David at Timescape is going to send me a copy and ultimately I'll find it in the library, I guess.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.220
If you have easy access to copy, I'd like to have one.

00:28.220 --> 00:33.820
Okay, well I've got one. I'll send it to you. In fact, I wrote him a letter the day that I read it.

00:35.780 --> 00:42.860
He called me at work when he got the letter and he said that he got turned on to Dick by your article in Rolling Stone.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.000
He asked me specifically to say hello to you and thank you for getting him turned on to Phil K. Dick.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.960
Isn't that great? That's very nice to hear.

00:51.760 --> 01:00.820
He was really, he was glad that somebody read it in Wall Street Journal and wrote him a fan letter and I thought it was kind of interesting that Wall Street Journal would even have something about Phil Dick.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.480
And I was kind of blown away by that.

01:02.620 --> 01:06.720
And he was really very nice. I talked to him quite a while and he said to say hi to you.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.820
Well, that's great. What's the same, Dubois?

01:09.460 --> 01:15.280
Dubois, D-U-B-O-I-S, two words. That's my pronunciation. I don't remember how he pronounced it.

01:15.380 --> 01:15.780
That's great.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.860
But I can send you a copy of it. That's no problem.

01:20.640 --> 01:27.620
That's really nice. I got a phone call today from Phil's editor and my friend David Hartwell at Timescape.

01:29.540 --> 01:37.240
And he said that Confessions of the Craft Artist is already being reordered. There's demand for a second printing.

01:38.200 --> 01:46.660
It's selling much, you know, even though it's a small printing, it's selling much better than expected and that they think the Wall Street Journal article is playing a significant part in that.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.580
Well, good deal. I hope people learn more about him.

01:52.520 --> 01:58.740
Okay. The interview that I constructed is a little looser than when I generally talked to authors.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.880
So we'll just probably meander around a little bit, so bear with me.

02:02.480 --> 02:07.340
What I'll first of all ask you is how did you become acquainted with Phil Dick?

02:09.000 --> 02:22.160
I met Phil at the notorious Oakland World Science Fiction Convention in 1968 at the old Claremont Hotel.

02:22.160 --> 02:36.120
And I had been turned on to his work really less than a year before that by some people who are kind of well known in the comic field,

02:36.420 --> 02:41.060
Trina Robbins and Artie Spiegelman, Bob Stewart.

02:41.060 --> 02:53.880
And I wrote about Phil's writing and particularly Bookhouse Readings of Time, which was the game players of Titan, in an underground newspaper called Avatar.

02:55.320 --> 03:06.240
And so when I met Phil briefly at this convention, even though we were both out of our minds because it's very similar,

03:06.240 --> 03:11.320
I gave him a copy of the underground paper with a story about him.

03:11.820 --> 03:23.020
And I guess it excited him as well because with some beginning of some kind of recognition of his then, you know, a few letters,

03:23.420 --> 03:25.440
and so forth, or what he was doing.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.840
And at that time I was just about to move out to California.

03:29.840 --> 03:41.980
So we saw each other several times, again partly through mutual friends, in and around 1969, the beginning of 1970.

03:43.200 --> 03:50.380
And oh, and in 1969 I had the occasion which is recorded somewhere in Valence.

03:50.380 --> 04:02.120
And so for a brief, mad period, I was Timothy Leary's campaign manager when he was just been released from the original thread of going to jail

04:02.120 --> 04:08.620
by winning Supreme Court victories that caused, you know, over a thousand other people to be released within the same week.

04:08.620 --> 04:19.640
The victory was that you couldn't be made to say that to pay the tax on marijuana because it was self-incrimination.

04:20.900 --> 04:28.360
At any rate, Leary got out of jail or out of the thread of it, decided to run for governor, had me be his campaign manager,

04:28.700 --> 04:36.860
and we went across the country and ended up in Montreal visiting John and Yoko where they were having their bed in for peace.

04:37.860 --> 04:47.600
And from John Lennon's hotel room, I found out from Tim actually while we were traveling I bought you a book which had just come out in hardcover.

04:49.060 --> 04:57.260
And Tim Leary turned out also to be a tremendous fan of Philip Dix and he wrote that this time really not very many people knew of him,

04:58.540 --> 05:00.840
except really die hard science fiction fans.

05:01.480 --> 05:10.560
So Leary had read a lot of his work and so from Lennon's hotel suite in Montreal we called Phil, I think on Lennon's nickels,

05:12.460 --> 05:20.300
and he got the chance to rap with Tim Leary telling him what a great fan he was for a half an hour.

05:21.700 --> 05:29.280
So this basically is one of the funny standout incidents particularly for Phil of our early connection.

05:31.960 --> 05:41.140
It was during these years that he was still struggling along and getting all these niggerly advances and had very low prestige,

05:41.400 --> 05:44.100
as you say, except for the hardcore science fiction fans.

05:44.100 --> 05:50.440
Why did he keep it up during those years? Even into the late 70s he was struggling and not making very much money.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.560
What kept him going?

05:52.660 --> 06:03.240
I think a real commitment first of all to the ultimate, I don't know if I want to say seriousness,

06:03.240 --> 06:14.000
but that's really a real commitment to what he was creating and what he wanted to say that always when he's written it's been because he had to write.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.480
And it was deeply true that it became the only way he could make a living.

06:19.820 --> 06:28.100
It's a classic freelance writer situation where even though you're okay if you only get $1,500 for a science fiction novel,

06:28.820 --> 06:37.160
then what you have to do to stay alive is write six of them in a year, which he came pretty close to doing at one point.

06:40.680 --> 06:51.880
I think he did not want to go back and start working in a record store again or basically give up on his career as a writer.

06:51.880 --> 07:00.600
It was not until early in the 1960s that he gave up trying to become a successful mainstream writer.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.960
And even then he didn't give up.

07:05.440 --> 07:13.020
Although it felt like that to him at the time, he just put it away in the back burner having tried very, very hard for 10 years.

07:13.780 --> 07:21.360
The first 10 years in which while he had his first 10 or so science fiction novels published, he wrote a mainstream novel for every science fiction novel he wrote.

07:22.620 --> 07:34.480
So really he was writing two novels for $1,000 advance, one of which would be published in a double novel and the other of which would go from publisher to publisher and just be turned down.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.760
And there are still 10 or 11 of those published.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.860
Any chance they'll ever get published, you think?

07:41.860 --> 07:44.080
I think that it's inevitable.

07:46.720 --> 07:53.580
Bill had mixed opinions about their quality and I haven't read most of them.

07:56.100 --> 08:07.660
But it seems clear, although we may be surprised that there's nothing as polished or as good as Confessions of the Craft Artist, which I think is actually one of his five or six best books.

08:10.040 --> 08:21.360
But because of the interest in Bill's work, it seems inevitable at this point that one way or another they will most or probably all be published within the next 10 or 20 years.

08:23.480 --> 08:31.340
But probably still by small publishers, not by New York publishers.

08:34.600 --> 08:41.480
When I was making up my questions, I notice now that a lot of them have to do with what he wrote about.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.980
And I consequently wanted to ask you a question.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.180
Was he really that way?

08:45.420 --> 08:46.640
Did he really believe that?

08:47.340 --> 08:49.520
And so this is kind of the first one of those.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.940
They may tend to get repetitive.

08:51.260 --> 08:58.560
But in all of his works, there's a mistrust of the senses of what the senses are telling us, a mistrust of reality.

08:58.560 --> 09:05.640
And he seems to be saying that the truth comes in glimpses every once in a while and that our senses can't really see it.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.680
It's kind of revealed to us that he really lived by that.

09:08.700 --> 09:13.500
Was that his philosophy day to day life or is that just his writing style?

09:15.640 --> 09:19.400
Yes, that was unquestionably a part of his daily lifestyle.

09:19.400 --> 09:26.300
I don't know if I would call that aspect of his philosophy.

09:27.240 --> 09:31.740
Although he definitely had one, but it was a very real part of his perception.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.960
And I spoke of the seriousness of his work.

09:36.960 --> 09:56.340
I don't know if I think that a primary purpose, if not the only one, has always been, you know, as a Sagittarius, to appear through the superficial reality around us of what only appears to be real

09:56.700 --> 10:04.580
and to get at what is really real in his view.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.380
And so everything that he wrote was an attempt to do that.

10:09.800 --> 10:26.600
And in his daily life, a lot of issues that would come up that you or perhaps he would describe as being at least partly indicative of a paranoid personality.

10:29.240 --> 10:39.180
But he somehow had an incredible sense of humor and awesome wisdom about it or ability to see himself dismay him.

10:39.220 --> 10:44.840
On the one hand, one of the craziest people that most of his friends ever knew.

10:46.780 --> 10:54.260
And on the other hand, it's just great to have that strength.

10:57.400 --> 11:04.280
In one interview, he said that you had accused him of being precognitive.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.200
Were you serious when you suggested this?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.260
That's interesting. I don't know if I ever saw that interview.

11:10.260 --> 11:13.540
I think that was in the Spice Fiction Review.

11:15.180 --> 11:27.560
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that I said something probably, he was referring to something in the Rolling Stone piece, hold on, I'm not sure.

11:28.240 --> 11:35.620
Even though he had a lot of private conversations, it's likely that that's what it was.

11:37.860 --> 11:49.420
He himself probably more strongly than I believe that at least in some ways that he had had incidents of being precognitive.

11:52.660 --> 12:09.400
And I think a good fictional illustration of that is the kind of theme that he has of a man sitting in a city and suddenly seeing himself as a very old man 30 years from now or whatever.

12:13.140 --> 12:21.000
He still used science fiction as a way of disguising actual reality so that it would be palatable.

12:23.240 --> 12:32.040
But he was definitely describing the horrors and humorous fascinations of a world that in almost every case is very real to him.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.460
In some ways he can take less of his books fairly literally.

12:40.020 --> 12:46.720
Was he labeled a science fiction writer only because that's the only category that seemed to fit what he wrote?

12:47.620 --> 12:51.480
Or was he really truly a science fiction writer? I guess it just depends on one's definition.

12:51.480 --> 13:06.060
Well he was truly a science fiction writer and I think that the primary meaning of that is that you belong to the club and you learn by reading science fiction.

13:06.060 --> 13:18.220
And he came up writing stories for all the science fiction magazines and then he started writing novels for Don Walheim at A's and was read only by science fiction readers.

13:18.220 --> 13:37.340
And was certainly aware of as a pan-suitor all the science fiction operating devices and the whole concept of the genre, the sense of those about to read science fiction.

13:38.420 --> 13:48.400
And I think that that's what it means to be a science fiction writer in a lot of ways is to come up from that world and to stay within that world to whatever degree.

13:50.020 --> 14:00.380
At least with part of your work. He definitely is that. He wasn't necessarily satisfied with that. That's easy to understand.

14:01.820 --> 14:11.400
But he did, although he's not a great reader of it after adolescence or whatever, he really loves science fiction.

14:11.800 --> 14:17.260
And the people that he wrote for and the people that he communicated with were all pretty much in that room.

14:18.160 --> 14:27.320
At least, yeah I think he diversified more in the last ten years. But still I would consider him very squarely a science fiction writer.

14:28.200 --> 14:38.240
More so today than Bradbury's. If there's any reason to make comparisons, I consider Bradbury in the end a science fiction and fantasy writer.

14:41.460 --> 14:51.500
In your conversations with him, was he ever wanted to bemoan the fact that science fiction is in the skit-o and the mainstream critics don't like it and that sort of thing?

14:51.580 --> 14:54.800
Or was he pretty much content just to write it and let other people worry about that?

14:54.800 --> 15:18.340
He cared about those things. He always had a very self-deprecating or humble attitude towards his work while at the same time always giving you to know somehow that he really took it as seriously and respected it as much as his most art defense.

15:18.920 --> 15:34.980
What I'm saying is that he really knew how good it was. But he was able to be very humble about it. Now let's see the question that you asked again.

15:34.980 --> 15:41.280
Oh, as far as science fiction being ghettoized, did he bemoan that fact?

15:41.280 --> 15:57.620
He bemoaned it in the sense that he felt that he and other writers in the field that he respects deserved wider attention.

15:58.880 --> 16:12.580
And he would play on, you know, if somebody was concerned about ghettoization, you know, he could give the lifelong interview on the subject as anybody.

16:14.920 --> 16:26.860
What frustrated him, and he was very frustrated by it, was primarily that he didn't have the freedom to write what he called experimental mainstream novels as well.

16:27.680 --> 16:45.900
And of course, it was a tremendous victory for him. Finally, possibly, but he was aware of it before he died when the trans-migration activity after it was published, you know, in hard cover to the first publisher that he submitted it to after writing the novel and so forth.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.100
Or actually before writing the novel.

16:53.420 --> 17:04.980
So it was something that he always wanted to do to write this kind of book. The ghettoization of him as a science fiction writer kept him from it for a long time.

17:08.520 --> 17:18.380
One of his strangest books, according to a lot of people, I've known several people who can't read it, is the Three Stick Mod of Palmer Eldridge.

17:18.980 --> 17:27.980
And I've read interviews where Dick said he had never taken acid before he wrote the book and he says that you verified this. He said he took it and then he read the proofs.

17:28.750 --> 17:34.280
And it scared him. Can you enlighten us on that? Is that pretty much the way it happened?

17:34.780 --> 17:44.280
It's true that he had never taken LSD or I think any psychedelic drugs before he wrote the Three Stick Mod of Palmer Eldridge.

17:45.400 --> 17:51.380
He had had experience with emphaticism.

17:53.580 --> 18:08.560
And as for then taking LSD and reading the galleys, that's possibly true except that it was years before he read the galleys and maybe years before he took the trip also.

18:08.560 --> 18:17.020
But he was afraid of it before he read them. He always claimed anyway to be scared to read the galleys when they sent them to him.

18:18.520 --> 18:26.340
And he didn't finally re-read them up again according to what he always claimed until a number of years later.

18:29.700 --> 18:34.500
But I'm sure there's no question that it scared him. It scared him while he wrote it.

18:34.940 --> 18:51.820
At one point he told an interviewer that he wrote it to kind of exercise a terrifying vision of the man with the stick mod of LSD in the sky while driving to the shack on the California coast of this.

18:51.820 --> 18:52.680
And he was doing his writing.

18:54.580 --> 19:01.400
And it was very real to him and terrifying while he was writing his book while reading it.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.480
I think by the way that it's a brilliant novel.

19:05.400 --> 19:12.620
Oh yeah, it's either number two or number three for me. I still haven't sorted it all out.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.980
But it's been about seven years since I read it too.

19:17.580 --> 19:27.240
I guess probably his best known novel until of late maybe was The Man in the High Castle.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.780
And there he used the Yi Qing before that became famous.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.140
Now it came out in 1962. I didn't read it until 1973.

19:36.780 --> 19:42.380
But I guess that blew a lot of people away who really hadn't heard of the Yi Qing and that sort of thing.

19:42.380 --> 19:45.380
And later he apparently repudiated the Yi Qing.

19:46.040 --> 19:54.200
Yes. He did in several interviews and he stopped using it.

19:54.480 --> 20:00.960
Since I originally was introduced to the Yi Qing by Phil's book and by someone else who had learned about it from Phil's book.

20:03.180 --> 20:05.260
And still he is the Yi Qing.

20:05.260 --> 20:24.520
I never took Phil's repudiation very seriously but he did have the experience that many people have that the book, The Oracle, essentially told him that it wasn't useful for him to keep asking questions of it.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.980
And his feeling and what he said was that it was actually trying to steer him.

20:31.580 --> 20:34.160
In some wrong fashion.

20:35.740 --> 20:46.340
But I think that that kind of incidental effect of The Man in the High Castle is introducing the Chinese Book of Changes to so many people who have been introduced into the whole culture.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.780
It's very fascinating.

20:49.900 --> 20:55.400
Yeah I think he said he finally quit it because it was trying to set him up.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.860
Right. Well he felt that way about a lot of things.

21:03.460 --> 21:10.020
I read that he liked to scan her darkly a lot and that he considered, at the time he wrote that, he considered it a masterpiece.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.420
And then I read that he only made about 3500 bucks off of it.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.680
And that was in the late 70s. He was still getting screwed then.

21:20.160 --> 21:26.080
Well yes although there's some element of distortion there.

21:26.200 --> 21:30.340
I mean it's certainly true that the book didn't get recognized, get it just desserts.

21:30.620 --> 21:41.380
I personally was involved in trying to find another hardcover publisher for it and I took it to one of the best who was expected to be sympathetic and they couldn't make a header tail of the book.

21:41.380 --> 21:48.320
And ultimately double days it was filled with satisfied with, ended up publishing it.

21:48.400 --> 21:55.000
He could find another publisher and later Phantom was unable to find any hardcover publisher for Valus.

21:55.960 --> 22:06.620
So this continued right through his career until the very end when he had the satisfaction of having the divination and the archer come out of hardcover.

22:06.620 --> 22:21.540
So yeah that was very frustrating and the amount of money involved up through Valus really but particularly scanner were very small.

22:21.900 --> 22:25.740
However by that time Phil was doing very well indeed.

22:25.740 --> 22:38.580
In fact he had sort of started to do pretty well at least by his standards during a period where he was still bemoaning to interviewers what a terrible business science fiction was.

22:40.080 --> 22:52.340
Because he kept expecting that the money that was suddenly coming in would blow up, dry up, blow away any day now and he'd be back to the usual properties since he was still only getting $2000 or whatever for each book.

22:52.340 --> 23:05.400
But what actually started happening is because of the quality of his work and the incredible vision that he has and this happened to other American writers that Charles B. Kowski is an interesting current example.

23:05.400 --> 23:20.780
Phil was very popular and very widely respected in other countries particularly France, England, Japan, Germany, Canadian countries, Italy and on and on.

23:22.740 --> 23:35.720
Long before he had any kind of reputation in the United States except as the Hugo winning author of Man in the High Castle and otherwise he was a popular paperbacky author.

23:37.520 --> 24:04.800
And that popularity abroad brought him to a point in the 1960s where suddenly he was earning for say over $15,000 a year and then pretty quickly more than that on a consistent basis with more than half of it coming from Warren's rights to his work.

24:05.720 --> 24:25.980
And of course what had happened had been a very prolific author as well and already by this time he had say 20 or 25 folks behind him and all the time he'd be getting $100 or $200 for this one or that one for this year's royalty earnings in this country and they'd be translated into 20 different languages.

24:26.560 --> 24:47.520
And it added up to quite a good income so that if you took any one of his books and could magically go back over its whole history you'd find out that most of the books that he wrote ended up earning him quite a fair amount of money over the course of his whole life and if he'd carried it on into his estate.

24:47.520 --> 25:03.660
And so he was making all of this, certainly a lot of money by the end of the century so that a book he may have sold for $1500 ultimately over the years brought in 20 or 30 or $40,000 and there's more to come and of course a few of them now are bringing in that moving money.

25:06.280 --> 25:27.000
So there's a kind of a paradoxical situation there but the success that he did have in his later years financially certainly completely came both from the quality of his work and from the incredible hard work that he'd done for so many years while he was serving which resulted in him having a large body of money.

25:27.000 --> 25:36.320
You know, any of us would, nobody wants to die at the age of 53 God knows but anybody would be proud to have the 50 books that Seltek wrote.

25:37.860 --> 25:44.460
How do you account for his popularity in other countries whereas he never really caught on that much until recently here?

25:45.620 --> 26:13.880
I think that this has happened to quite a few very good and very original American writers that in a way they're a person like Phil, his vision is so strong and really so American that it is difficult for people to appreciate here when it's first articulated.

26:15.620 --> 26:24.980
But in Europe or in Japan they'll read these novels and say, my God, you know, here's somebody who's really talking about America. This really has to play over the real thing, you know.

26:26.640 --> 26:40.560
They're impressed because it cuts through cultural assumptions and all that to really paint a very powerful picture of the place and time that the author lives in.

26:40.560 --> 26:54.760
And that's really missing from a lot of writers who might be more popular in their own country at their own era because their work, however good it is in various respects, is also more palatable.

26:54.760 --> 27:13.960
It isn't as demanding in terms of, it's like a biblical prophet who's simply standing up and telling you the truth about what's really going on in this culture and in this world and is usually stoned or ignored for telling the truth.

27:14.920 --> 27:38.240
At the distance I think of Europe or Asia, it was much easier to appreciate the brilliance and humor and intensity with which Bill Dick was telling the truth in these novels where it was only for the hardcore fans here in the United States.

27:40.380 --> 27:50.200
Okay, his last five novels, okay, let's put it this way, his last five science fiction novels that were published accounting transmigration is a science fiction novel.

27:51.880 --> 27:59.360
Just starting with Flow My Tears but really then more with The Scanner of the Darkly but then really the last three valence, divine invasion and transmigration.

27:59.360 --> 28:11.120
That was something really different, totally different from anything we'd seen before and apparently he had a change of life or saw some visions or something that really made him open this up.

28:11.520 --> 28:17.720
Do you perceive this as something new in him or was this just a logical conclusion of where he'd been going to all the time?

28:17.720 --> 28:22.320
Well, it is certainly something new.

28:22.480 --> 28:32.200
I mean he in fact saw these three books, these last three books as a kind of a trilogy even though they have different settings and subjects.

28:32.200 --> 28:53.660
This thematic material is extremely related and it comes out of his own personal experiences and one sort of mystical experience in particular and also out of at least six years of really intensive research into theology and philosophy

28:53.660 --> 29:05.600
and in many ways the spiritual history of human beings at least over the last five thousand years or so which he just totally immersed himself in.

29:07.160 --> 29:12.840
Originally on the pretext that he was doing research for valence which ultimately turned out to be true.

29:14.380 --> 29:23.060
There was a period of about three or four years where he didn't write a novel and we all wondered if he would again and I'm sure he would.

29:23.980 --> 29:40.360
So this extraordinary work particularly the last three books definitely as you say comes from a change of life other than that in the sense that going down to the church and getting religion

29:40.360 --> 30:08.800
there was an awakening in him of writing about as exactly as he describes in valence by an incident I guess in 1975 where he's sitting in his car in a very southern California town Santa Ana

30:08.800 --> 30:22.480
or fortune around there and is kind of zapped by this pink buffing light and nothing was really the same again after that.

30:22.480 --> 30:38.480
He spent a couple of hours in a really a very subtle kind of other world and it was only his sense of the importance of this experience that really gives it its way.

30:38.480 --> 31:01.520
So in other words exactly what he went through the other might have shrugged off who didn't have his particular powers of perception and interest but he became obsessed with the revelations that he had around and his questions about what was that and why.

31:03.080 --> 31:30.860
And ultimately his answers which in effect are his answers and in the sense of the combination of his entire work his answers to tentative or whatever to all the questions he's been asking in all his books what is reality you know what is history what's really going on and why and what is it real nature of forces here and as

31:31.700 --> 31:40.600
somebody quoted Einstein is saying you know I spent with that he could reporter asked him what you say if you could answer if you get the answer to any question.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.940
What question would you ask and I'm not immediately answered is the universe friendly.

31:48.940 --> 32:14.200
And that was certainly a burning question on the mind of Philip K. Dick in every book he ever wrote and there is a kind of extraordinary revelation in the last two or three books in which while still giving that incredibly penetrating ruthless vision of the way things really are and often you know still quite a depressing tone.

32:14.200 --> 32:19.820
Nevertheless comes through with a very strong fiction.

32:21.900 --> 32:43.420
Yes we are ultimately in the hands of or at least strongly under the influence of a basically friendly creature much greater than us that is on our side in a battle that is far from decided.

32:44.700 --> 32:55.440
But you could make this as similar to the Christian myth or myth of almost any other great world religion or as different from it as you wanted to.

32:56.140 --> 33:10.240
You know you can make a great case that hey this man believes you know the straight party line you could make a great case that the heretic whose books should be burned you know by every organized this organized religion in the world.

33:10.240 --> 33:25.300
So that there's no easy conclusion has to because it is so uniquely as vision has to what the meaning of the vision and the information part of his last work is.

33:25.300 --> 33:42.420
But there seems to be no question that he begins to really make some very strong statements about what he finally thinks is going on.

33:46.540 --> 34:03.780
He said in one of the interviews that he was an ardent Christian quote unquote I'm sure he couldn't be mistaken for somebody in the moral majority but what how do you interpret that what was his feelings was he a Christian in what sense of the word.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.920
I think that have you read Timothy Archery yet.

34:09.360 --> 34:09.900
Oh yeah.

34:09.900 --> 34:24.540
Well I think that there's portrait of an art Christian in Bishop Archer in that novel and that that gives at least gives some clues.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.420
As to the nature of that for Phil.

34:31.160 --> 34:38.340
He did have an intense and in some ways kind of secret relationship with Christianity.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.180
And even the church and particularly the Episcopal Church.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.660
Certainly during the last decade of his life.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.700
Although was.

34:52.260 --> 34:56.060
As many things they love hate relationship.

34:57.180 --> 34:57.680
And.

34:59.020 --> 35:03.600
His oldest daughter who is a devout of this.

35:03.880 --> 35:08.080
You know is so far.

35:09.700 --> 35:14.220
Has done almost afraid to to read balance because.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.480
The theological ideas are so radical and.

35:20.860 --> 35:24.480
It's upsetting to her as it would be to anyone.

35:25.880 --> 35:36.600
In any sense with servers within that mainstream and really it should be upsetting to any intelligent person although also fascinating.

35:39.820 --> 35:47.640
So that I think that for most people if they heard that that he was or described as an art Christian they would tend to misunderstand.

35:50.260 --> 35:50.780
And.

35:52.220 --> 35:52.740
It.

35:54.720 --> 36:02.880
The image that you get from that is not a real good representation of Phil although in fact if you really knew him you could say that yes this is exactly true.

36:04.780 --> 36:16.380
This is a man who is very very aware of the Christ story and even you know the language and what's behind it and.

36:19.040 --> 36:27.000
His concerns regarding that are pretty clear in balance and the definition and Timothy are true.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.760
But the.

36:30.900 --> 36:37.280
The question the powerful I think you could see in Timothy Archer also a very powerful like.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.880
You know a willing and uncertainty.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.580
Need to ask questions to doubt.

36:46.400 --> 36:50.940
Even at the same time of experiencing an artist sense of faith.

36:51.480 --> 36:56.000
And very much part of those spiritual life.

36:59.600 --> 37:07.260
Yeah to me he would he was a true agnostic I guess with a capital A because he did distrust the senses and.

37:08.820 --> 37:18.360
You can't prove it so so why is it important that that aside from philosophical theological beliefs that that to me is agnosticism really.

37:20.600 --> 37:27.240
I think that you know there is a profound spirituality in that kind of agnosticism with with a capital A.

37:28.060 --> 37:28.400
And that.

37:28.960 --> 37:39.300
His work I believe would be and probably already are welcomed by intensely religious people of a theological sense.

37:39.300 --> 37:44.820
I mean anyone of real faith who really is interested in the great question.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.240
Is going to be delighted ultimately to discover.

37:49.780 --> 37:58.760
These outrageous novels like the Divine Invasion and the Transmigration and Timothy Archer which really ask passionate questions and care about the answer.

38:00.460 --> 38:01.600
In that whole sphere.

38:04.220 --> 38:16.040
Okay I'm bouncing around among these three so which which is understandable I hope that that vision that he had has intrigued me a lot I read.

38:16.220 --> 38:31.500
I guess the text of it in the Platts interview and then I before I read Valis then I read Valis and then I read the letter that Ursula McGuinn wrote to fill about how she was afraid he was going off the deep end and that sort of thing and his reply.

38:31.600 --> 38:40.420
Kind of kind of made me think well you know is this a fictitious device or did this really happen and I really got confused and hence more interested in it.

38:40.900 --> 38:44.480
I guess it really did happen or that's how he perceived it anyway.

38:47.180 --> 38:52.720
It's totally subjective experience you know even if he describes it right it's something that that happened to him.

38:52.720 --> 39:01.480
You know in fact one of the issues that comes up for him is how do you prove something like that you know to yourself that's much than anyone else.

39:02.880 --> 39:20.180
But absolutely no question that that it was very realistic and that you know the horse lover that character in Valis is as real as a self portrait as you can find.

39:24.780 --> 39:41.720
I just got my the new locus today I get a second class so maybe it's the old locus but in the books in print in the back they list the transmigration of Timothy Archer and I guess it's Charlie Brown that reviewed it but he said it's

39:41.720 --> 39:48.460
ostensibly based on Bishop Pike but the reader will notice that it's really Phil that's the lead character.

39:49.500 --> 39:55.500
Is that true? Is Bishop Pike really Phil? Was that him doing all this searching?

39:56.520 --> 40:01.260
Well it is Bishop Pike.

40:01.680 --> 40:07.660
I'm sorry I guess I should say it was Bishop Archer filled it to clarify that.

40:07.660 --> 40:25.020
Bishop Timothy Archer is unambiguously a portrait of Bishop James Pike of the diocese of Northern California so Phil knew.

40:27.460 --> 40:46.020
Now if you want to take that a step further it's perfectly reasonable for the reviewer and locus to say that it's obviously Phil in the sense that one can certainly make a case that all the characters in all those books are himself.

40:47.520 --> 41:01.420
I think that's a meaningful thing to say. It is very much like different sides of themselves having conversations with each other and the conversations are very alive as they happen.

41:01.420 --> 41:18.300
But in that sense certainly the concerns while they reflect Phil's sense of James Pike are also very much a protection of his own concerns that is the best that Pike cares about and wonders about.

41:18.300 --> 41:37.160
So it's a reasonable statement but I think that at the same time that doesn't mean it's not also a portrait of Romanic about Pike. It is possible for an author to do both those things.

41:40.460 --> 41:45.620
What was Phil's relationship with Pike? Were they close friends or just acquaintances?

41:45.620 --> 41:49.080
What is the relationship with Pike?

41:51.860 --> 42:01.880
I don't totally know. My impression is that they were fairly close for a period.

42:05.660 --> 42:17.980
And in terms of the amount of time spent together or whatever I doubt that there was really a lot of it but I think that the closeness is probably very real on both sides over several years.

42:21.840 --> 42:40.300
Phil's wife, Nancy, her mother is the character I forgot her name in the novel Timothy Archer who is the Bishop's mistress.

42:41.480 --> 42:45.680
So that was how Phil happened to know Jim Pike.

42:46.460 --> 42:57.660
Although he was I think interested, you know, inevitably would have been interested in giving actual concerns, interests, you know, with both theologically and in the paranormal and so forth and personality.

42:57.660 --> 43:10.100
And it was a thrill for Phil to know the man and have the friendship and fascinated conversations with him.

43:10.100 --> 43:19.880
But it was this connection through his wife's mother which actually stepped out of it.

43:23.920 --> 43:30.980
Which ends up being, you know, in large part the basis of the sort of insight given in the novel.

43:30.980 --> 43:38.120
The lead character really is not the official type that is the protagonist, is Angel.

43:39.260 --> 43:42.940
And there's an even more fascinating question is is Angel Phil?

43:43.240 --> 43:55.560
Yes, certainly she is and yet I like Ursula Gwynne's comments about what a beautiful character Phil has created in Angel Archer and how much Ursula comes to care about her.

43:55.560 --> 44:13.040
And again I think that while it's perfectly right to say that this character Angel is in many ways, you know, phil dick, it's also right to say that she's a completely creative character, it's very powerful.

44:13.900 --> 44:19.000
And you know, it's a true female character which is quite an accomplishment.

44:20.820 --> 44:27.280
And Phil felt that and said that he bottled her Angel after his daughter's life.

44:30.700 --> 44:33.360
That was my next question, who was she?

44:34.160 --> 44:43.960
But I was really intrigued with the internal dialogue, her internal dialogue, Angels, when she was thinking about herself and how she went on and on.

44:43.960 --> 44:52.900
It's almost stream of consciousness and I figured there was some of him in there but that was almost to me the best part of the book was that Angel clearly made the book to me.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.740
I heard other people comment that as well.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.800
That's great. That's wonderful. He would be delighted to hear that.

45:03.040 --> 45:08.860
I've read the book in a fit of passion which is the way that you always write although I've been writing about it for a long time.

45:11.540 --> 45:25.460
Last spring, the spring of 1981, and about the actual writing was in a period of time, probably less than six weeks.

45:28.160 --> 45:36.300
I know that he said he wrote incredible amounts of words, or lots of words and incredibly short amounts of times.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.900
I didn't know if that one was one of those or not.

45:40.360 --> 45:55.400
Yeah, almost all of his novels are, even though some of them go through two drafts, but the actual work, including the work of writing a new draft or whatever, after a tremendous amount of preparation, meditation, you know.

45:56.560 --> 46:05.820
The actual work was in most cases done in a very short span of time, as little as three weeks in some cases.

46:06.440 --> 46:23.280
You cannot distinguish the gorgeously written, supposedly more literary novels like, I don't know, I'd say, Ubic and A Eat the Confessions.

46:24.100 --> 46:28.780
And the ones that he had published in the hardcover through Double Day.

46:30.320 --> 46:41.240
You can't really distinguish them by the process of writing from the ones that were written for A's and that in some cases appear to be more tossed off.

46:41.240 --> 46:53.240
I think that there is a distinction, you know, that he's more relaxed and not trying to achieve as much on some levels.

46:53.920 --> 47:06.480
In a novel, I'd say, our friends from France say, although his heart is very much there, but I'm just saying that interestingly, I think you'd find in most cases the actual process of writing a typing isn't that different.

47:06.480 --> 47:11.460
Probably in the case of a Ubic or a man in the high cast were obviously balanced or trans-migration.

47:12.920 --> 47:22.340
The years of meditating on the subject and on the problem with the novel and how are you going to write it, and a lot of questions that don't become answered until he starts writing.

47:24.320 --> 47:29.320
There was a lot more of that process in the more work through novels.

47:29.920 --> 47:37.560
And some of the lighter ones are ones that, while he wrote them in the same, you know, three to six weeks, he hadn't really thought about them before.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.960
So they're more like spontaneous stuff.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.200
And maybe not as deep.

47:46.220 --> 48:00.500
Although then you have this experience, you know, so there's books where it looks like Frostade or many of the A's books, similar, whatever you know, will suddenly run incredibly deep.

48:01.940 --> 48:08.260
Whether this be a part of it or you'll have some experience reading it, that's extremely powerful.

48:08.260 --> 48:14.240
And it's harder in that sense to divide yourself into two greater factors.
