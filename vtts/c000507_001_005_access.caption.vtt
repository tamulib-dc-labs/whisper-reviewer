00:01.880 --> 00:12.120
And I'm preparing this for the Science Fiction Oral History Association. Of
course, the oral history tapes on old times are important. But tomorrow morning,

00:12.160 --> 00:20.660
the events of today will be history. I still recall in 1920, when I was in the
fifth grade, the feeling of wonder and shock with which we learned that the

00:20.660 --> 00:29.760
eighth graders upstairs were studying World War II from their history books. How
could something we had just lived through be history? And I understand that

00:29.760 --> 00:41.140
there are people today feeling the same shock at finding that the 60s are any
story of this. Well, out of the wisdom thus learned, I wish to give you this

00:41.140 --> 00:50.700
cassette of thoughts and statements of very recently. Mostly they are thoughts I
presented at meetings of the Little Men's, which is to say the elves, gnomes,

00:50.760 --> 01:00.000
leprechauns, and little men's chowder, marching, and science fiction society,
the source of the Invisible Little Men Award. The organization was named after

01:00.000 --> 01:09.560
the social club to which belonged Mr. O'Malley, Barnaby's fairy godfather, in
the comic strip by Cockett Johnson in the days between World War II and

01:09.560 --> 01:19.760
McCarthyism. It ended then because Johnson was reported to have had a communist
class. In the earliest days, the little man published the Rotomagnetic Digest,

01:19.920 --> 01:28.200
of which, I have been told, at least one complete set was still extant as
recently as a year or two ago. But I wasn't one of the little men at that time.

01:28.500 --> 01:37.400
These thoughts are much more recent. There was the time, for instance, that I
reviewed Poul Anderson's Home Brew, a collection of excellent short pieces of

01:37.400 --> 01:47.000
which perhaps the most brilliant is Uncleavie's True Thinking, in which he
translates atomic theory into English. I had occasion to comment on his

01:47.000 --> 01:57.020
characterization of fascism on page 28 of the book. I noted that anyone living
today should know that the packaging is not the contents and that the sales

01:57.020 --> 02:06.480
pitch is not the product. Furthermore, we do know what fascism is. Just as
communism as attempts of people living under fewer regimes to move towards

02:06.480 --> 02:16.500
democracy and industrialization, fascism is an effort to stop a people's moves
into democracy and to move them back to a medieval society. Of course, neither

02:16.500 --> 02:27.120
effort can be fully successful. Shortly after reviewing the book The Early Long,
I had occasion to mention my earliest memory of a work by C. L. Moore. Since

02:27.120 --> 02:33.260
much of The Earliest Long and The Earliest More both appeared in Weird Tales,
this was entirely appropriate.

02:35.880 --> 02:47.380
Those of you who have read The Early Long may remember that the earliest long
was fairly representative of the usual contents of weird tales. No evoking of

02:47.380 --> 02:56.800
weirdness or horror, just an assertion of it. No real description, just an
assertion of indescribableness. A heavy reliance on slime and filth and stench

02:56.800 --> 03:05.980
and immobilization. The murkiest of background hidden with the murkiest of
prose. But don't get the idea that all of it was like that. There was some

03:05.980 --> 03:16.540
action prose and some true description. For me, the high point of that came in
September of 1934. The East Bay Scientific Association was the local branch of

03:16.540 --> 03:26.080
the World Fan Organization, the International Scientific Association. We met at
Aubrey McDermott's house that month, in fact, most months. My copy of Weird

03:26.080 --> 03:36.460
Tales hadn't come yet, but Aubrey's had. He handed it to me, opened, and said,
Read that story. So I read it to him. It was so perfectly written that it simply

03:36.460 --> 03:46.500
flowed with no effort on my part. it was a beautifully clean prose everything
was simply told clear and clean description just told what happened what the

03:46.500 --> 03:55.080
characters did and said and what happened to them and how they destroyed each
other it was a tale of how a defeated warrior woman escaped from the dungeon of

03:55.080 --> 04:04.580
her conquered castle went down a hole in its lowest level and found there a
world with a power which she came back and used when i finished the members

04:04.580 --> 04:14.060
thought i had been rehearsing to read it so well but i'd never seen it before it
was simply that good a job of writing the writer was C. O. Moore the story was the

04:14.060 --> 04:25.760
black god's kiss it's now in print in the best of C. O. Moore another note i found
in my archives is undated and also takes off from a passage written by Poul i

04:25.760 --> 04:32.600
probably never before mentioned it to anyone but because i have used it to
comment on the nature of science fiction it's worth recording.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.540
Poul writes that it has been said that those who do not learn history must repeat it.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.780
Ben Bova in another magazine published a little sooner, wrote that, to paraphrase Santayana,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.780
those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat the mistakes.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.940
I remember both endings.

04:51.660 --> 04:57.400
The both of my versions say that those who do not or was it refused to learn from history

04:57.400 --> 04:59.680
are condemned to, et cetera.

05:00.940 --> 05:09.880
There is considerable difference of content here. It makes little
difference whether we must or are condemned or are doomed, but it matters much

05:09.880 --> 05:18.300
whether we need to learn history or to learn from it, and whether history has
lessons we must learn or simply contents from which we must draw our own

05:18.300 --> 05:29.360
learnings. Another instructor in my department has been known to ask his student
why truth is better told by myths than by factual instruction, and this has

05:29.360 --> 05:38.720
relevance here. It is noteworthy that the truths learned from history are never
embodied in our histories, but in our mythologies, which often then are

05:38.720 --> 05:51.520
reabsorbed into the histories in forms designed not to purvey but to hide the
truth. However, my colleague's point has relevance here, although I do not know

05:51.520 --> 06:00.420
that he would share the truth as I see it. Poul, for instance, often does not.
The relevance lies in the essence of the difference between fact and truth. A

06:00.420 --> 06:10.880
fact is an idea or an understanding which corresponds to reality in the outside
world. Truth is that which corresponds to our own conceptions of the universe.

06:11.120 --> 06:22.160
This is the appeal science fiction has for many of us, and also why many people
find it weird. Often they prefer out-and-out fantasy, such as in normal

06:22.160 --> 06:31.840
mainstream fiction, which accords with the truths that normal zombies of our
culture are supposed to accept. Even they know it to be unreal and escapist. And

06:31.840 --> 06:41.060
science fiction is no less so but at least we don't try to pretend it's real.
Then we can use it to convey truths as well as to hide through facts. As Randall

06:41.060 --> 06:54.600
Garrett maintained that a past fan can mention at San Francisco Airport science
fiction and mythologies have much in common. Back in February 1976 I did a

06:54.600 --> 06:59.320
review of another of Poul's books so I might as well throw it in at this point.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.580
Those of you, I told the little men, who are in the science fiction book club
will already have read The Winter of the World. It's a good adventure story, with

07:13.580 --> 07:22.740
a certain amount of intrigue more suggested than actually described, and because
Poul is one of the more thoughtful authors, a lot of stinking do is on. In this

07:22.740 --> 07:32.600
book, most of it's in italics, so if you want to, you can skip that, but I warn
you, if you do, you'll miss a lot. Like many of Poul's longer stories, it's a

07:32.600 --> 07:41.260
little more complicated than the story requires. In some cases, that improves
the book, and in others it doesn't. In this case, it helps fill the space

07:41.260 --> 07:49.440
between the covers, which is all right. Publishers have their needs, too. It's
about the Mississippi Valley and the rest of the world about five or ten

07:49.440 --> 08:03.120
thousand years into a new ice age, hence the title. It involves an empire out of
Texas in northern New Mexico whose name is spelled R-A-H-I-accent-D, and I don't

08:03.120 --> 08:13.780
know whether to pronounce it Ra-Ed or Ra-H-I. As I say, Poul is a thoughtful
man, and being a very domesticated man, he's undoubtedly writing his yearnings,

08:13.960 --> 08:24.920
which he shares with most of us, when he explores the gulf between wild and
domesticated animals. And remember, domesticated doesn't necessarily mean tame.

08:25.320 --> 08:34.320
There's a saying that in the Galapagos Islands, the wild animals are tame and
the tame animals are wild. If you want me to, I'll explain that. Poul's explored

08:34.320 --> 08:44.980
the question before in a shorter Van Rijn story, saying that of two groups of
aliens, one was domesticated and the other was wild animals. And Van Rijn

08:44.980 --> 08:55.080
pointed out that most of us are domesticated, but he and his group are wild
animals. similar considerations are given in this book in an evolutionary point

08:55.080 --> 09:05.500
of view and he has one thing right evolutionary change always starts with a
change of behaviour that is of habits and ecology but i don't like his

09:05.500 --> 09:15.320
terminology for his aliens in the benrhein story there wasn't enough information
but for people like benrhein and like the rogovicki in the winter of the world

09:15.320 --> 09:26.120
we have very precise other terms which are better Wild animals are stocks which
have never been domesticated. Animals which have had domesticated ancestors but

09:26.120 --> 09:36.720
are not now under domestication have very characteristic features, unlike true
wild animals. We say they have gone wild, and the technical term is feral. Both

09:36.720 --> 09:46.500
the Van Rijn pack and the Rogoviki are described as feral. They are also
described as pack predators, as opposed to being herd animals. By and large,

09:46.680 --> 09:56.700
pack predators operate from a home base, but are not truly territorial in the
sense of fixed boundaries to their reign. For the little man's meeting of

09:56.700 --> 10:13.700
Friday, November 26, 1976, I gave a very short talk on the social science in
science fiction. Of course, the first thing I did was to say it wasn't going to

10:13.700 --> 10:24.460
be limited to that. I told them that I had told Richard the leader of the
meeting that I would say something on that subject, but when I started working

10:24.460 --> 10:34.660
on it I realized first that I would be more comfortable calling it science and
behavioral sciences and science fiction because anthropology is both, and

10:34.660 --> 10:45.340
anthropology is how I think. Then second I realized that they are just not time
for an organized presentation, so So I said I will refer you to Pamela Sargent's

10:45.340 --> 10:53.860
Introduction to Women of Wonder for a very good and very well organized
presentation in one aspect of the field, which only has to be paraphrased to

10:53.860 --> 11:02.920
apply to several other aspects. I'll make some remarks about how the
relationships are in general, not a review of specific stories, then I hope

11:02.920 --> 11:12.180
you'll all have questions to ask after I've said this. Actually, they did not
have very many questions to ask. I think they were too anxious to go and

11:12.180 --> 11:23.900
socialize at the club they go to after meetings. So, I went on to say, by the
standards of today, social and behavioral sciences are important in science

11:23.900 --> 11:32.320
fiction. Of course, they were always important, in that the way they were
handled or not handled made the difference between a good story and a not-so

11:32.320 --> 11:43.900
-good story. Such elements are usually referred to as background, and character
development, and plot handling, or plot the luck, and various other aspects of

11:43.900 --> 11:54.020
storytelling itself. And they were what makes 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a
supreme masterpiece, and Mysterious Island, its sequel, just a moderately good

11:54.020 --> 12:02.440
adventure to it. John Campbell is often given credit for introducing them into
science fiction, but they were certainly present in Food of the Gods and Tars

12:02.440 --> 12:12.560
Tarkas' Revolution, Antharchian Morals, to say nothing of Ralph 1. Du Forseffro
and Blish. The reason Campbell gets such credit is mostly because so many writers

12:12.560 --> 12:22.280
remember that Campbell was paying a cent a word and sometimes two cents for stories
which had some of these features, while Fred Pohl and his fellow unfortunates on

12:22.280 --> 12:32.280
other pulps were paying from a fifth to half a cent for stories that didn't.
What they don't stop to think about is that Campbell knew about these things

12:33.740 --> 12:44.580
because Harry Bates, paying two cents a word, and F. Orland Tremaine paying one
cent, had previously demanded it of Campbell. You may object that most of John

12:44.580 --> 12:51.780
Campbell Jr.'s own stories didn't have much in the way of character development,
but each of them did have something in the field of social or behavioral

12:51.780 --> 13:00.380
science, even if social and behavioral scientists might disagree with what he
did. The readers didn't want any better. As a matter of fact, they mostly agreed

13:00.380 --> 13:09.540
with him. The difference now is that with people like Ursula Le Guin and
McCaffrey writing, the standards for treatment of social and behavioral sciences

13:09.540 --> 13:19.140
and science fiction should now be at a higher level than the personal prejudices
of John Campbell and Ben Bova, or, for that matter, Jerry Pournelle. There are

13:19.140 --> 13:28.400
certain things we do know about people. We know that people tend to act in what
they consider to be their own best interests. And we know that this includes

13:28.400 --> 13:36.540
being able afterwards to live with their consciences. We know that people tend
to want to reciprocate what they get from others. This includes revenge as much

13:36.540 --> 13:46.140
as it includes paying other obligations. We know that, on the other hand, that
people tend to want to take things which are denied to them, but that they can

13:46.140 --> 13:54.840
be taught not to do this. We know that some people are capable of great cruelty
to others, and that other people raised in much the same cultures do not approve

13:54.840 --> 14:04.380
of this. There are many different kinds of behavior which anthropologists refer
to as war, but some peoples do not have any such behaviors, and many people

14:04.380 --> 14:14.600
refuse to take part in them. Many people write and talk about aggressive drives,
but one thing we do know is that aggression is not a separate drive, but that

14:14.600 --> 14:25.140
the word is a cover term for various behaviors engaged in for various reasons
when, but not always when, any drive or desire is interfered with it. We also

14:25.140 --> 14:34.460
know that such aggressive urge can be inhibited and then may or may not turn
against other targets, from the person himself to perfect strangers seen only at

14:34.460 --> 14:43.360
a distance. People who live in excessively polite cultures tend to be
excessively vicious in wars or in personal killings. We know that the basic

14:43.360 --> 14:52.720
relationships between people are power-mediated relationships, and that power,
and hence aggressiveness, is behavior related to control of access to resources.

14:53.360 --> 15:02.700
We know that dominance and submission are power relations and hence also involve
such control and lack of control, but that also dominance is itself a very

15:02.700 --> 15:12.560
prized resource, since a resource is anything anyone needs or wants or can be
fond into thinking he should try for. The various commodities, for instance,

15:12.720 --> 15:22.140
which are offered by those who conduct our practices of religion, are at times,
and for many people, very valuable resources. Information is a most important

15:22.140 --> 15:31.620
resource, and those who control access to it can be very powerful. It should be
noted that often, the actual practitioners in its supply do not control either

15:31.620 --> 15:42.240
the access or the supply. In our culture, this is what advertising and
publishing are concerned with. Because social relationships are power

15:42.240 --> 15:51.140
relationships, and the resources required and available depend on the
technology, and not only the technological level, but the technological biases

15:51.140 --> 16:03.720
of the states of the arts, technology is very important to social organization.
However, rapid technological change may not bring social changes so rapidly. The

16:03.720 --> 16:12.460
various fascist movements, for instance were efforts to reestablish feudal
social relationships in a period of industrial capitalism And as Milavon Giles

16:12.460 --> 16:21.220
pointed out in the book that got him in jail the first time the communist and
socialist revolutions were efforts to establish industrial technology in

16:21.220 --> 16:31.500
countries whose prevailing social structures were still feudal and colonial For
these reasons, plus those mentioned by James Gunn in This Fortress World I'm

16:31.500 --> 16:40.840
very leery of stellar empires, though Van Vogt had a rather plausible
possibility in the weapons shop universe. Doc Smith's civilization is even more

16:40.840 --> 16:52.780
convincing. As to Blish's fascist future, and I've already mentioned why not,
the substrate culture is now gone. To make a good story, you have to create

16:52.780 --> 17:02.460
tensions in the reader. Violence is a most inadequate way to do this, and
besides, it creates in the reader or viewer the erroneous belief that violence

17:02.460 --> 17:14.360
is fun and that violence solves problems. Also, as Ben Bovo points out in Notes
to a science fiction writer, slam-bang action is not what we mean by conflict.

17:15.460 --> 17:24.080
In science fiction, the main conflicts, that is to say, the tension-producing
situations, are simply culture shock and future shock, especially the

17:24.080 --> 17:34.120
explorations of extrapolations like Age Gold encourages writers to do for Galaxy
and the various worlds created, for instance, by Ursula Le Guin. These are

17:34.120 --> 17:43.860
wholly social and behavioral problems within the spectator himself being
operated upon by what he sees in the story. One thing I liked very much about

17:43.860 --> 17:53.020
John Campbell's A Post to Stories was his violation of one rule of American
storytelling. Our culture places great emphasis on failure. The object of

17:53.020 --> 18:02.340
competition and testing is not to produce winners, is to produce losers. And
thus, a general rule of our fiction is that a protagonist has to go through a

18:02.340 --> 18:11.560
cycle of degradation. He's not allowed to win until he's had a few failures.
John Campbell wasn't interested in this. He was interested in winners. His writers

18:11.560 --> 18:20.980
couldn't always go along with him, so he printed a lot of degradation cycle
stories, but he didn't insist on it as most editors do. Anthropology is the

18:20.980 --> 18:32.160
social and behavioral science that deals with groups of people. but that still
deals with them not only as people, but as whole human beings. That is why the

18:32.160 --> 18:40.440
very best science fiction has a lot of ethnography in it, because ethnography is
the branch of anthropology which deals with societies and cultures as the

18:40.440 --> 18:49.480
beliefs and activities of individual human beings living together as organized
groups. Doc Smith was a master at this, and he did it so well that most people

18:49.480 --> 18:58.280
don't realize he was doing it. Naturally, there's lots more I could say. but
some of you may have questions, and the rest of you probably want to get out of

18:58.280 --> 19:15.540
here. They did. Also at that time, I prepared a comment on the election debates
for my anthropology classes. In the first debate, I told them, Mr. Ford charged

19:15.540 --> 19:23.960
that Jimmy Carter's successor, the present governor of Georgia, had told Ford
that the Medicare setup in Georgia was a shambles, and that therefore Carter

19:23.960 --> 19:32.520
wasn't much of an administrator. The poor klutz didn't even realize that
Medicare is a federal program and that it's a scandal all over the United States

19:32.520 --> 19:42.420
and that the governor was not complaining about Carter as an administrator, but
about Ford. The governor, that is, the current governor of Georgia, did try to

19:42.420 --> 19:50.680
set the record straight the next day, but it got very brief mention in the media
and hasn't been picked up by the Carter campaign either. Carter, on the other

19:50.680 --> 20:01.140
hand, noted the need for a national health program and that there were poor
people he knows in his plains who had very great difficulty getting any medical

20:01.140 --> 20:10.540
care. but carter did not it would never occur to him to realize there might be
an intimate relationship between the poverty of those friends of his and the

20:10.540 --> 20:17.620
fact that the carter family owns five and a half billion dollars worth of
property and business none of which could exist without the presence of a

20:17.620 --> 20:28.760
reservoir of low paid mostly seasonal rural labor the whole little agribusiness
setup he has is completely dependent on him if they were his slaves he would

20:28.760 --> 20:36.680
recognize his need responsibility and would have health care for them just as he
has mechanics for his machinery and calls them veterinarians for his livestock.

20:37.180 --> 20:46.080
But for over a century, no one has admitted that there is slavery in America, so
his responsibility is reduced to a tug at his heartstrings and an effort to

20:46.080 --> 20:54.660
shift the burden from the county hospital and the local property tax to the
federal government, so we can have a Medicare shambles for everyone and not just

20:54.660 --> 21:06.560
for folks who were over 65, who have Social Security. Now that, of course, doesn't
at first glance look like science fiction, but at least, it's a footnote in

21:06.560 --> 21:22.620
preparation for reading some, say, of James Gunn's medical future. In her
excellent introduction to Women of Wonder, Pamela Sargent writes on pages is

21:22.620 --> 21:45.460
small Roman numerals 32 to 34, a footnote, mostly concerning quotations from
Stanislaus Lem and Ursula Le Guin, largely also concerning the status of the

21:45.460 --> 21:48.980
men, women, and the people of winter.

21:52.800 --> 22:08.580
i wrote to pamela sergeant and to ursula le guin about this i'll quote from the
letter to ursula le guin While reading his remarks, and before I got to yours, I

22:08.580 --> 22:19.620
was thinking how he fit my stereotypes for his sex-cultural psychology as a
Central European man. Then, when he threw in the observation that, quote,

22:19.920 --> 22:30.300
cultural psychological conditioning, unquote, was more powerful in biological
minds, with the insistence that the conditioning must necessarily be the same in

22:30.300 --> 22:42.240
Karhide as in Poland, despite his later statement of the contrary. My
stereotype? Well, I was thinking that you, as a woman, even here in the free

22:42.240 --> 22:53.000
world, had been writing of the Cithinian cycle as liberating from the tyranny of
sex roles, while Lem, as a Central European male, was responding that it made for

22:53.000 --> 23:03.020
intolerable uncertainty. Obviously, at least for them, Polish dialectics has not
yet achieved the Marxian ideal of abolishing the contradiction between male and

23:03.020 --> 23:11.840
female roles, and not even the general uncertainties which are part of life in
patron-appliant societies. Or had you heard of George Foster's development of

23:11.840 --> 23:18.120
Konigman's image of the limited good, which actually is a special case of the
principle of fixed available amounts.

23:20.740 --> 23:31.800
About what one wears in 20 Below Wins. steyfenson said how come he got so much
credit for the few winters he spent in the arctic and none for the twenty-odd he

23:31.800 --> 23:43.960
spent in north dakota and he never saw any weather in the arctic to max that in
dakota well how did one handle skirts in indian women wore rawhide skirts, very

23:43.960 --> 23:57.060
heavy. white culture had cloth skirts, and they wore pants under them, winter
woolies and cotton or linen bloomers, but it was the skirts and underskirts that

23:57.060 --> 24:06.140
showed, the latter mainly by bulk. i have often wanted to write to you to tell
you my opinion which i have expressed to many others, that you know much more

24:06.140 --> 24:15.320
about people than your father did, and quite likely more about peoples. I do not
know how he was at home, but around the department he was the living embodiment

24:15.320 --> 24:24.260
of his thesis that culture operates people rather than the other way around. He
was very much the professor and very much the head of the department, but still

24:24.260 --> 24:34.960
at times the vivid, vital individual would show through and we could see what
status and role were being separately from the man. Odd that he and Murdoch and

24:34.960 --> 24:42.480
White, the three who most thought that the individual who is hopeless in the
hands of culture, that they probably more than any others of their generation

24:42.480 --> 24:52.820
influenced and molded the culture of American anthropology. But I wander. I have
one more comment on your comments. You asked about a neuter or a non-committal

24:52.820 --> 25:04.760
pronoun. If anyone believes that English lacks such a pronoun, then they have
forgotten how much effort their parents and teachers expended to stop them from

25:04.760 --> 25:21.940
saying they in the singular and speaking of winter I hope i will be seeing you
at Vancouver next summer well she wrote back saying that lem was very charming

25:21.940 --> 25:28.760
in his letters but that what most people didn't realize about that that he plays
the european scholarly game

25:32.140 --> 25:44.760
I thanked her for confirming my judgment of Lem. He is right in the stream of
Central European society. Because The Bad-Mannad Arrogant, that is, Patronizing,

25:45.020 --> 25:55.820
European scholarly game is not a game at all. It's deadly serious. And I do mean
life and death. It's a client making and patron refusing behavior. The private

25:55.820 --> 26:05.600
charmingness is at home there too. It's appropriate for client-keeping and for
addressing an equal whom one doesn't wish to have respond in the client-making,

26:05.740 --> 26:17.120
patron-refusing style. And it's also appropriate to use to someone who really is
a patron grade over you. I reported this at a little men's meeting, and I added

26:17.120 --> 26:28.500
to them, You remember what I said about excessively polite cultures being very
vicious in war or feud? Well, this is a sample. later in that meeting the

26:28.500 --> 26:43.580
regular speaker for the meeting was a man who had engaged in contract physics in
Europe and in America and he commented on the cutthroat nature of the people in

26:43.580 --> 27:00.520
academia and also in industrial jobs in nuclear physics and other kinds of
physics and the expressions and descriptions that he used in speaking of this

27:01.780 --> 27:09.080
were very much in line with what I just said about the scholarly game. In fact,
I caught his eye and he grinned back at me.

27:12.000 --> 27:25.700
I also just ran across a note which is dated the 1st of March 1970 which I
discussed with Poul at a little man's meeting soon after. In the prefatory note

27:25.700 --> 27:38.140
to the story of the three-cornered wheel in his book, The Trouble Twisters, he
quoted a Vance Hall that, and the quotation is, man, the child of earth, lives

27:38.140 --> 27:50.300
by certain principles which are immutable, end quote. These are there given as
Parkinson's First and Second Laws, Sturgeon's Revelation, Murphy's Law, and a

27:50.300 --> 28:05.220
fourth law of thermodynamics. This latter, in my estimation, is merely a way of
stating the law of entropy. And it seems also that Parkinson's first law only

28:05.220 --> 28:15.360
applies to humans within the orbit of civilization. That law, for folks touched
by civilization, which is to say affected by exploitation, and the others, in

28:15.360 --> 28:26.420
some degree for all folk, are human ways of making entropy, but they're far from
being immutable. They're highly variable, both in degree and in manifestation,

28:27.760 --> 28:45.100
though they do touch most of the laws for all people, and Parkinson's first law
only for those in civilization. Two years ago at Oakland, and i understand some

28:45.100 --> 28:58.840
other cons around that time there was a panel of writers talking about the
military mind and how misunderstood it was by many people

29:03.460 --> 29:18.040
um it occurred to me that it was possible there might be such a panel at
vancouver so I wrote to them and said that it was almost impossible to answer

29:18.040 --> 29:30.280
these people from the floor but if there was such a panel I would like to be on
it so I could give some words of true wisdom from the table instead of fighting

29:30.280 --> 29:42.720
for a spot from the floor well I haven't heard from them so I don't think that I
will be on any such panel but I did prepare some remarks.

29:45.740 --> 29:59.440
After all, I didn't know how much time I would have so I boiled my absolutely
minimal essential presentation of about 4 hours. I boiled down to about 5

29:59.440 --> 30:00.660
minutes and 10 seconds.

30:03.920 --> 30:14.820
I was going to start with a reference to the West Coast maneuvers of July 1941,
before the United States was officially in World War II. There were two armies,

30:15.340 --> 30:25.880
one of regular Army units and one of former National Guard outfits, with the
rules made so the regulars couldn't possibly lose. They were losing, so the

30:25.880 --> 30:35.480
rules were changed to favor them still more. And again. Finally, the whole thing
was called off a week early, just before the final debacle. You see, all during

30:35.480 --> 30:44.880
peacetime, the War College keeps the regular Army officers trained about what to
do when war comes. The National Guard officers get some of this, but they don't

30:44.880 --> 30:53.900
take it all that seriously, because they have to spend most of their time living
in the real world, something the regular officers don't know much about. There

30:53.900 --> 31:02.880
was one guy in my regiment who did take it seriously. the security officer. The
others didn't take him seriously, but they should have. He was what it was all

31:02.880 --> 31:16.660
about. Well, we're right. We do make cracks about the military in Martin. And we
don't see that much difference between military occupation troops in so-called

31:16.660 --> 31:29.900
peace and the conquest troops in war. Oh, the bodies are prettier. They shave
and bathe more often. in almost all societies the organization of fighters for

31:29.900 --> 31:40.320
war parallels that of men's work groups in fact they often have the same
personnel but in our society and I include here the Soviets the organization of

31:40.320 --> 31:50.100
the military is like the social organization which preceded ours the kind of
society we refer to as feudal or semi-feudal the peasant-based societies

31:50.100 --> 31:58.640
organized into patron-cliant sets, where patrons are to make the decisions and
clients are first to be exploited and second to be hoarded. And to put up with

31:58.640 --> 32:08.080
that, they have to be specially indoctrinated. As Auburn McDermott reminded us
from the audience at Oakland, four hundred years and more ago, the people did

32:08.080 --> 32:19.480
not think the way we did. Our type of civilian mind was then just beginning to
rise to contest the hitherto unchallenged rule of the military mind. and then I

32:19.480 --> 32:29.440
was going to ask if anyone in the audience knows the purpose of close order
drill the Russians once tried to abolish close order drill and they found that

32:29.440 --> 32:39.940
they had no army L. Ron Hubbard who wrote Fear and Typewriter in the Sky and
that masterpiece Final Blackout and Ordok Methuselah stories was in the military

32:39.940 --> 32:51.500
he was a navy commander and one of his basic teachings is that all authority
rests upon the ability to move people about physically in space. So, I was going

32:51.500 --> 33:01.800
to say, I'll put this in terms that at least the Scientologists here will be
able to understand. Close order drill is an opening procedure drill to reduce

33:01.800 --> 33:13.040
com lag between the time an order is received and the time it's carried out. So
I'll just go there, do that, stop it, do something else, go somewhere else. You

33:13.040 --> 33:21.840
see the close order drill and you see the opening procedure drill. It's simply
to condition you to take orders without stopping to think about it. The

33:21.840 --> 33:31.240
difference is that Scientology later teaches you how to make up your own orders
and give them to yourself. And the military never willingly lets you go. You

33:31.240 --> 33:42.640
wind up being a wind-up toy. Programmed to their ideas. and you start wondering
why these crazy civilians won't just bend over and do what you think they

33:42.640 --> 33:53.280
should. And that is why we make such remarks about the military mind. Now, I
could go on with this, but I'll sum it up. The purpose of the military is not to

33:53.280 --> 34:02.880
die for one's country. It's not even to make the enemy die for his country. It
is to make the enemy live for one's own country. That means to destroy the enemy

34:02.880 --> 34:12.180
as an independent organization. In other words, the purpose of the military is
conquest, which is to say, the increase of one's own client's set and its

34:12.180 --> 34:19.800
perpetuation. And if you want a course in the anthropology of peasant base,
military administered patron client societies, I'll be around.

34:23.480 --> 34:40.920
So, it occurs to me that some of the people on that panel awed me. I wasn't used
to the helpless inadequate feeling I got when I heard them on this subject. The

34:40.920 --> 34:50.140
nearest I can recall is the way I used to feel around a certain corporal soon
after I was first drafted into the U.S. Army. And since it's an example that

34:50.140 --> 35:04.320
shows the nature of some aspects of this particular military mind, let me tell
you. He was a little big for his age So he lied about his years and joined the

35:04.320 --> 35:14.820
National Guard when he was in high school And they double-crossed him and
started getting ready for war His outfit had been activated in October 1940 So

35:14.820 --> 35:25.860
by the time I was drafted in February 1941 He already had four months of a
nasty, muddy Puget Sound winter under his bed They'd gotten some training

35:25.860 --> 35:37.280
between raindrops and now they were a training cadre and he was a corporal and
they were supposed to pass what they'd found on gas. Well, nothing's perfect so

35:37.280 --> 35:46.700
now and then I'd have to ask a question and even very seldom make a suggestion
like, if we're going to be digging all these holes wouldn't it make sense first

35:46.700 --> 35:54.420
to set aside the turf from where the hole and the pile of dirt are going to be
and then afterward lay it over the dirt so it won't be quite so obvious just

35:54.420 --> 36:03.980
where the holes are? You know, I wasn't trying to show up to the trainers. It's
just that I wanted my fellow draftees to have at least a minimum chance of

36:03.980 --> 36:13.980
survival if it came to that. Besides, I'm selfish, and the more survivor types I
have around me, the better chance I have of surviving among them. Well, this

36:13.980 --> 36:21.380
corporal was one of the snottiest of snot-willed kids. You understand, he wasn't
dumb. He really had great potential. It's just that he thought he was already

36:21.380 --> 36:30.300
there. He was on the same floor of the same barracks as the squad I was in.
Thank God he wasn't my corporal. I had a real good corporal. I really loved

36:30.300 --> 36:42.040
having that. But the kid embarked on a real deliberate campaign to humiliate me.
Well, I was living it. Only one day I was over in the rec room writing a letter.

36:43.000 --> 36:50.840
Naturally, I got a table as far back as possible along one wall so I could see
everything, especially who came in and went out the door. Then a bunch of kids

36:50.840 --> 36:57.840
came in, including the corporals. They had an older sergeant with me. He was
from another outfit, and I'd never seen him before, but I noticed they held him

36:57.840 --> 37:07.860
in very hard regard, and he had a forest green braid on his sleeve, which meant
that in a previous military incarnation he'd been an officer. They took seats in

37:07.860 --> 37:16.060
the corner behind me, and I wasn't paying any attention, after all it was none
of my goodness, but suddenly the corporal's voice rose above the level of the

37:16.060 --> 37:30.220
conversation, and he said, The worst kind of bullet is ricochet. Ricochet. You
know. Whang! Well, I don't know what possessed me to butt in, but I turned

37:30.220 --> 37:40.540
around and said, The worst kind of bullet is a spent bullet. It drifts along.
Hunting. The sergeant got very excited. He said, You've been in action. Where

37:40.540 --> 37:51.060
were you? And I said, Hmm? You were in action. Where was it? And just about the
time I began to get back control of my lower jaw, the corporal began to realize

37:51.060 --> 37:52.880
what was happening, and he lost control of his.

37:55.820 --> 38:04.060
Well, I wish I could say that after that he was a changed character, but he
wasn't. It's just that he was no longer carrying on a deliberate campaign. But

38:04.060 --> 38:13.300
you see what I mean about a hopeless, helpless inadequacy. How do you educate
brilliant but ignorant people who already know everything? Now I want you to

38:13.300 --> 38:22.160
understand though That the corporal's attitude Was completely characteristic of
the military mind And it's documented by numerous studies Of patron client

38:22.160 --> 38:32.000
societies It's especially found in situations Where the respective ranks Do not
very much differ People who are clearly of patron grade Have much more effective

38:32.000 --> 38:41.780
ways To keep clients aware of the fact People with just a little authority Have
to keep fighting for it and the methods they use are born of desperation. The

38:41.780 --> 38:51.440
fact that I didn't want his job was immaterial. I was obviously going to be one
of the first new TFCs, and he was the youngest old corporal. To the militarized

38:51.440 --> 38:53.420
mind, he was in dire danger.

38:58.520 --> 39:09.140
I was also hoping that someone would pick up on that remark I made about the
security officer being what it was all about, and would ask me from the audience

39:09.140 --> 39:22.340
what I meant. I had an answer to that, too. The answer is this. You've heard it
said that our army is always ready for the last previous war it was in. In 1941,

39:22.340 --> 39:31.240
we were going to fight against Hitler's conquest of the German people and in
France and the Low Countries and Norway, also against the Japanese conquests and

39:31.240 --> 39:41.920
those of Mussolini. The last war our military was in at that time had not been
against Germany in World War I, but the interventions through Archangel and

39:41.920 --> 39:49.240
Vladivostok and in the Baltic States, and they've never forgiven the rest of us
for the war we actually had them fight in the 1940s.

39:52.940 --> 40:03.880
I understand that the Oro History Association itself grew out of the meaning of
Lloyd Biggle's Fred Pohl, in which Fred Pohl said he'd heard from me. The letter

40:03.880 --> 40:15.260
I wrote him was a result of his statement on page two of the early poll that in
March of 1933 fandom didn't exist. I wrote variants of it to the three main pro

40:15.260 --> 40:24.220
-mags. It never surfaced in Amazing, even though it contained a leader
commenting on the 50th anniversary issue and how Amazing under Gernsbeck had

40:24.220 --> 40:36.460
actually spawned the very first fan org. Ben Bova returned a postcard saying,
That's fandom. And here at Analog, we don't get into fandom. Galaxy, which does

40:36.460 --> 40:45.580
get into fandom, also sank the letter without trace. Then I wrote Al Gore in
direct reply to their having reprinted the statement by full, and I've been told

40:45.580 --> 40:55.060
they printed the letter, but I haven't seen that issue. Jonesback ran quite a
letter column and printed the addresses in full, so from almost the first there

40:55.060 --> 41:04.240
was some correspondence between the readers. Finally, Ray Palmer organized it.
He seems to have written to everyone whose address had appeared. The result was

41:04.240 --> 41:15.460
the Science Correspondents Club. The magazine began in 1926. The club may have
started as early as 1928 or as late as 1929. I'm sure it was not as early as

41:15.460 --> 41:26.980
1927. The name was later changed to International Scientific Association. Then
one summer day, I answered a ring at our door, and a tall, dark, young man asked

41:26.980 --> 41:35.620
if my brother was older. Well, I had three brothers, but I assumed he meant the
older. Turned out that's what he assumed, too. You mean Alan, I asked? No, he

41:35.620 --> 41:45.940
said, Hufton. It was Auburn McKibben. The next one he contacted was Lester
Anderson in Hayward. We formed the East Bay Scientific Association, and the name

41:45.940 --> 41:56.180
would never change, even after we had members in San Francisco. I know it lasted
until at least 1935, and maybe later. Aubrey says it must have been started in

41:56.180 --> 42:05.960
1928, because he has something about it in my handwriting, dated 1928, and it
now. I know it had to be after the parent organization became International

42:05.960 --> 42:16.460
Scientific Association, because we copied that name. I'm also very sure it had
to be 1930, because I recall it was just after I'd come home after shipping on

42:16.460 --> 42:26.120
the tanker district of Columbia, and enrolled in the University of California
summer session, and that was 1930. After the international organization was

42:26.120 --> 42:36.040
founded, Gernsbeck had one of his cover picture story contests. I think it was
the first one, maybe the only one from Amazing. I toyed with trying to write a

42:36.040 --> 42:46.340
story to enter, but Ray Palmer wrote one and won. I believe the prize money was
$100. He used it to buy the organization a mimeograph and put out a club or a

42:46.340 --> 43:00.600
cosmology. You could get quite a mimeograph for $100 in those days. Anyway, from
then on, the president was also editor. By 1932, Aubrey was president and

43:00.600 --> 43:09.360
editor, and I was secretary and assistant editor. In passing through two or
three hands, something had happened to the mimeograph. What we'd received from

43:09.360 --> 43:19.320
past President Eaton in Atlanta was not a machine. Eaton swore it was just what
he had received from his predecessor. The mimeograph drum was flattened out to

43:19.320 --> 43:27.740
about a quarter circle, a flat deck was laid over it, and a handle put in the
middle of the deck. This you held and leaned on while rolling the drum and

43:27.740 --> 43:36.020
stencil the length of the sheet of paper. I've seen them since for postcard
size, but that's the only one I ever saw for eight-and-a-half-by-eleven paper. I

43:36.020 --> 43:48.480
saw quite too much of it. Aubrey saw more. I left in August 1932 to go to be
graduate assistant in anthropology at the University of Nebraska. I stopped to

43:48.480 --> 43:58.740
see some members in Oregon and Washington and hitchhiked to Milwaukee where I
made the same mistake with Ray that Aubrey made with me. The first thought I had

43:58.740 --> 44:08.220
when he opened the door was, my gosh, he didn't tell me his younger brother was
hunchbacked too. All the time I was there, Ray was warning me about the people

44:08.220 --> 44:17.600
I'd be staying with in Chicago. Walter Dennis was founder and president of the
Chicago Club. Ray had visited and told me, Dennis' mother was German and said,

44:17.800 --> 44:26.280
Great store of good food and would keep insisting I have more at meals and
forcing it on me. Actually, I didn't see anything unusual, and nobody forced

44:26.280 --> 44:36.820
anything on me. The Chicago club was actually not very active fannishly. They
had founded an astronomy club based on the then quite new Adler Planetarium, and

44:36.820 --> 44:46.500
the astronomy club had sort of swallowed the fan club. Ray had also mentioned
our one member In Lincoln where I was going It was one of our few girl or young

44:46.500 --> 44:56.800
woman Members and it seemed some of Ray's Letters had been rather glowing
Incidentally just as I Always sign my name C-H-A Small letter H and small letter

44:56.800 --> 45:10.480
A Ray always used Rap Small A and small P I think we both started that Before
either of us wrote to the other I asked my lift into Lincoln how to get to the

45:10.480 --> 45:20.600
fan's address. Why, that sounds like it's down in Russian town, he said, making
it plain no one would want to go or know anyone down there. It seemed everyone

45:20.600 --> 45:33.020
down there spoke German. As a matter of fact, there were in that part of town
many people from Russia being volt of Germans, like many of the loggers on the

45:33.020 --> 45:43.200
northern California and the vecino coast, who were Russian Finns. Well, I found
the place. It wasn't well. It seems she was recently married, and her husband

45:43.200 --> 45:52.360
had seen at least one of Ray's letters. Ray had known it, as she had written to
ask him not to send any more. I can't recall whether I shaved off my beard at

45:52.360 --> 46:02.220
Milwaukee or after I got to Lincoln. Dr. Myles J. Brewer also lived at Lincoln.
His office was in the building a block and a half from where I got a room. I

46:02.220 --> 46:07.280
never did see it. His receptionist evidently didn't approve of science fiction
and let me know I was unwelcome.

46:09.980 --> 46:18.340
Christmas vacation, I went to Boston to visit the other local fan club We
believe that it was older than the Chicago one But probably not as old as East

46:18.340 --> 46:26.680
Bay At some time, briefly, there seems to have been one in New York City But
just when, I don't know Maybe Kanye Ruppert might know He put out Science

46:26.680 --> 46:36.660
Fiction Digest And I spent a couple of days with him He lived in South Ozone
Park then In one of those hyphenated Queen's addresses a lot of others around

46:36.660 --> 46:48.060
Boston I visited as I recall one of the Oregon members named Ockerman possibly
with two N's who was going to MIT he was in nuclear chemistry there were very

46:48.060 --> 46:58.160
few of them now I guess they're all absorbed into nuclear physics that winter or
the next one at I believe Washington University near St. Louis L. Ron Hubbard

46:58.160 --> 47:09.160
and John Campbell Jr. were taking the very first class ever given called nuclear
physics During his Dianetics period Campbell announced that he had discovered that

47:09.160 --> 47:18.860
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny was a very important engrammic phrase behind
his mind and he couldn't understand why it should be so strong in the mind of a

47:18.860 --> 47:27.720
physical scientist Then he remembered that he grew up in the household of a
biologist But he seems never to have made the connection between the above facts

47:27.720 --> 47:37.280
and his lifelong dedication to the proposition many cultural phenomena are of
genetic origin Incidentally, the weather that winter was very cold and deep

47:37.280 --> 47:45.620
snows hit just before I started. I couldn't hitchhike. I went by freight to
Elizabeth, New Jersey and by a bus from New York City to Boston and back, then

47:45.620 --> 47:55.220
freight's back to Lincoln. After that storm, Ray wrote, the east wind blew off
the frozen lake and made it even colder in Milwaukee. He took pitchers of hot

47:55.220 --> 48:02.760
water to the second floor window, poured them out in front of people coming
along. The outside of the water would freeze on the way down, shatter against

48:02.760 --> 48:11.420
the wall, and a cloud of steam would rise up in front of him. On the other hand,
how much of that ray wrote me as true is questionable. Other people say he wrote

48:11.420 --> 48:26.660
them different accounts of his life at that time. To change the subject
completely, Spider Robinson's recent column on Books by Women inspired me to

48:26.660 --> 48:36.060
write him quite a letter. one of the points I made to him was that I couldn't
understand why it took him so long to accumulate all those books because most of

48:36.060 --> 48:45.240
them were old books. Even considering how long it takes to get something
published in amazing.

48:46.920 --> 48:59.000
However, since I wrote him the letter, I've been thinking more about women
writers of science fiction. And it's true. there have always been women writers

48:59.000 --> 49:10.760
of science fiction there have always been very good women writers of science
fiction the point is there have not been the cloud of mediocre women science

49:10.760 --> 49:24.880
fiction writers as there has been a cloud of mediocre men science fiction
writers regardless of whether they use their own names or their initials or a

49:24.880 --> 49:27.800
fake name, still,

49:28.620 --> 49:45.740
for a woman to break into science fiction writing, she had to be real good. And
then, of course, there's the recent June 1977 women's issue of Analog. He said,

49:46.160 --> 49:59.340
Ben Bova said, that he could not get women artists. it's very strange at the
same time this thing was on the stands there was an issue of Galaxy on the

49:59.340 --> 50:15.200
stands with a cover and interior work by Bonnie Dalzell and oddly enough her
work for that galaxy was very very similar to the cover art and inside work that

50:15.200 --> 50:32.660
appeared by a man on the women's issue of Analog totally unlike other, and to my
eyes better, work by Bonnie Dalzell. And by the way, did you see the AP wire

50:32.660 --> 50:45.720
photo of the Prudhoe Bay control room for the Alaska Pipeline? I swear, those
two hard hats sitting there are aliens, or maybe one of them is only half-alien.

50:46.300 --> 51:03.900
The names are Margis, M-A-R-G-I-S, Freichtl. F-R-E-I-C-H-T-L. And the other one
is named Dave Funtempt. F-U-N-T-E-M-P-T. Surely those are not Earth names. Maybe

51:03.900 --> 51:06.840
they were devised by Jack Vance. Maybe.
