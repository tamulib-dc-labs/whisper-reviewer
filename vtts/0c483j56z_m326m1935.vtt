00:34.169 --> 00:53.295
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:53.656 --> 00:54.777
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tom Turbyville.

00:55.398 --> 01:02.510
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every World War II veteran served overseas as they had jobs or were being trained for essential jobs stateside.

01:03.091 --> 01:09.782
[SPEAKER_00]: Such was the case for Dr. Gordon Pratt, who joined the Navy in 1943 and was put in the B-12 program.

01:10.343 --> 01:20.680
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a college training program that sent future commissioned officers to colleges and universities to complete their training and to help the war effort as a result of their education.

01:21.048 --> 01:27.359
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 1943 and 1946, more than 125,000 men were enrolled in V-12.

01:27.880 --> 01:40.643
[SPEAKER_00]: They included such servicemen as football coach George Allen, Senator Howard Baker, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Johnny Carson, and Jack Lemmon, and a dental student named Gordon Pratt from Dallas.

01:40.994 --> 01:51.071
[SPEAKER_00]: After the war, he served as the dentist for nearly two years aboard the USS President Adams, a World War II transport ship, and then later at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.

01:51.572 --> 01:56.300
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pratt practiced for 40 years as a dentist in Bryan until he retired in 1997.

01:57.502 --> 02:02.210
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his five children, Gordon Pratt Jr., has been a dentist here for nearly 25 years.

02:02.811 --> 02:04.854
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome Dr. Gordon Pratt Sr.

02:05.315 --> 02:06.377
[SPEAKER_00]: to Veterans of the Valley.

02:06.948 --> 02:08.510
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pratt, pleasure to know you.

02:08.590 --> 02:16.541
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I got to know each other back in May of 2010 when we went on the Lone Star Honor Flight together in Washington, and we'll talk a little bit about that later.

02:16.561 --> 02:22.570
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about what I referred to about the V-12 program and sort of how you got involved in that.

02:22.590 --> 02:34.406
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that after Woodrow Wilson, you went to Denton, to North Texas, and you were taken out of North Texas, 75 of you, and you were two of those 75 that were sent to the Navy in the V-12 program.

02:34.466 --> 02:35.267
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that.

02:35.770 --> 02:47.475
[SPEAKER_01]: The 75 of us went over to Louisiana Polytech in Ruston, Louisiana, and there were 600 students there at the V-12 program.

02:47.495 --> 02:51.163
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 of them were Navy, 300 of them were Marines.

02:51.143 --> 03:02.341
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other North Texas student and I that were in the Navy, we got along fine with the Marines because we knew so many of them.

03:03.123 --> 03:13.379
[SPEAKER_01]: But at Louisiana Tech, we took our classes that got us ready for whatever we were going into.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.042
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

03:16.068 --> 03:40.058
[SPEAKER_01]: I stayed there over a year, and then I went to Lake Pontchartrain Naval Hospital, which is northwest of New Orleans, and I stayed there for about a month, and then the dental school in Dallas called me to come in, and I went up there and started school in 1944.

03:40.298 --> 03:41.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.303
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go back home to the dental school there.

03:44.654 --> 03:53.866
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, the Navy was just pleased as they could be to have you stay there and finish dental school because they needed dentists, right?

03:54.166 --> 03:56.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

03:57.591 --> 04:08.885
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other students, not only dental students, but they were engineering students and medical students at Louisiana Tech.

04:08.905 --> 04:09.666
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

04:11.232 --> 04:18.462
[SPEAKER_01]: Louisiana Tech is a small school, about the size of North Texas.

04:19.264 --> 04:24.952
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people over there in the Navy treated me very, very well.

04:24.972 --> 04:30.500
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciated that and the way the people in the town took care of us also.

04:30.900 --> 04:40.935
[SPEAKER_01]: They had students that went to college, but they had to move out of the dormitories to let the Navy and Marines come in there and stay as commissioner.

04:41.202 --> 04:42.888
[SPEAKER_01]: non-commissioned officers.

04:43.049 --> 04:43.611
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

04:43.851 --> 04:53.305
[SPEAKER_00]: When you joined the Navy, though, in 1943, did you know at that time that you would be part of the B-12 program and that you wouldn't be going overseas, or did you know that for sure?

04:53.842 --> 05:00.851
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't know it for sure, but I was accepted after I applied for B-12.

05:00.932 --> 05:08.302
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of as the top students, but I'm sure there were some of them.

05:08.722 --> 05:14.810
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of my first roommates had been a Navy SEAL, and he wanted to go back to war.

05:15.351 --> 05:19.697
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to go to college, but he got put in the B-12 program.

05:20.268 --> 05:27.628
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came over, but at the end of the first semester, he went back into the Navy as a SEAL.

05:28.216 --> 05:28.537
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

05:28.817 --> 05:35.788
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you told me is when you were in Dallas at the dental school there, you recall when the war ended in 1945.

05:36.149 --> 05:43.681
[SPEAKER_00]: And you remember, you know, we always hear and see pictures of celebrations in Paris and New York City and Times Square.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.224
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in Dallas when the war ended.

05:45.244 --> 05:45.584
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Dallas.

05:45.624 --> 05:47.608
[SPEAKER_00]: And the celebration was pretty big there, you recall.

05:47.628 --> 05:52.215
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't hardly get two blocks without about an hour or something.

05:52.195 --> 05:54.198
[SPEAKER_01]: working your way of shoulder to shoulder.

05:54.478 --> 05:54.959
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.482
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the crowd was there.

05:56.502 --> 06:05.616
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, when they finally announced that Japan had surrendered, well, they, golly, everybody was hugging everybody else.

06:06.497 --> 06:08.320
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all happening in downtown Dallas?

06:08.340 --> 06:09.001
[SPEAKER_00]: In downtown Dallas.

06:09.121 --> 06:16.132
[SPEAKER_01]: We went down there because we knew the war was ending and wanted just to be with the crowd.

06:16.472 --> 06:18.716
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew there was going to be a celebration, right?

06:18.736 --> 06:19.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it was.

06:19.958 --> 06:20.278
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

06:20.512 --> 06:27.619
[SPEAKER_00]: who would be your future wife, Margaret, had been in nursing school in Dallas, and you and Margaret were married

06:27.785 --> 06:30.991
[SPEAKER_00]: the day after you graduated from dental school in 1949, right?

06:31.251 --> 06:37.522
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and she had two brothers that were dentists in Oklahoma, and I've got a big background.

06:37.542 --> 06:52.628
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandfather was a dentist, and I have an older brother that would practice in a little town down in the Spanish capital down in the valley, and then moved to San Antonio and practiced there for many years.

06:52.962 --> 06:56.907
[SPEAKER_00]: The dental profession is all through your family.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.709
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned, you have a son who's a dentist.

06:58.729 --> 07:00.632
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you have a daughter who's a dental hygienist.

07:01.132 --> 07:03.455
[SPEAKER_01]: And a granddaughter that's a dental hygienist.

07:04.336 --> 07:04.857
[SPEAKER_01]: My goodness.

07:05.017 --> 07:08.341
[SPEAKER_01]: And a son, a grandson that's a dentist and an MD.

07:08.421 --> 07:08.902
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

07:09.122 --> 07:10.304
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

07:10.824 --> 07:20.096
[SPEAKER_00]: You did finish dental school, and then right after you got married, Margaret was about six weeks behind you graduating from nursing school, but you had to get on to Norfolk, Virginia for your next tour of duty.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.699
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that tour and then Margaret following you.

07:23.152 --> 07:32.901
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was sent to the Norfolk Dental Clinic, which was part of the Norfolk Dental Community.

07:33.642 --> 07:36.165
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a big base at Norfolk.

07:36.185 --> 07:38.627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stayed there for a while.

07:38.647 --> 07:39.728
[SPEAKER_01]: And we practiced.

07:39.748 --> 07:46.314
[SPEAKER_01]: There were three of us in my class, dental class, that went to that particular base.

07:46.334 --> 07:49.778
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were on the reserve.

07:49.878 --> 07:52.180
[SPEAKER_01]: We went in and...

07:52.615 --> 08:04.589
[SPEAKER_01]: about four months before they upped the wages for people who came in the service and became officers after September of that year.

08:06.111 --> 08:15.602
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course our congressman said that wasn't the intent of the law to eliminate us, but they didn't do anything to help us.

08:15.582 --> 08:19.506
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe your oldest daughter Donna was born when you all were in Norfolk, is that right?

08:19.546 --> 08:30.015
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, she was my first child and she was born at the hospital, not at the Naval Hospital, but at the regular hospital in Norfolk.

08:30.215 --> 08:33.498
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and she's here in Bryan teaching at Sam Rayburn School.

08:35.020 --> 08:43.868
[SPEAKER_00]: In Norfolk, a little more than a year you were there, and you had a captain at the time that tried to get you to join the regular Navy, but

08:44.337 --> 08:47.781
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't go that route, and you were assigned the USS President Adams.

08:47.801 --> 08:50.685
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk a little bit about that early time of your service.

08:51.946 --> 08:58.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in Norfolk, we had a big dental clinic.

08:58.314 --> 09:09.248
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of us were just out of school, and then we had two or three officers that were higher up in the classifications.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.820
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a good tour of duty.

09:12.880 --> 09:28.553
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to practice in dentistry, and it was really an enjoyable time until Captain Harris, who later became admiral and became head of the dental department all over the United States,

09:29.377 --> 09:36.686
[SPEAKER_01]: until he called the three of us in individually and tried to talk us into going into regular Navy.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.728
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of the three of us wanted to.

09:40.571 --> 09:43.754
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the three was from New Iberia, Louisiana.

09:44.936 --> 09:51.604
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, we had a good group there.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.653
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us were pretty friendly.

09:54.614 --> 10:03.987
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of competition between the Marines and the Navy, but they didn't actually get into any real brawls, as you'd call them now.

10:05.029 --> 10:09.515
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from the USS President Adams in the war, it had been a transport ship.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

10:10.456 --> 10:14.221
[SPEAKER_00]: And talk a little bit about the ship itself, the President Adams.

10:14.402 --> 10:16.405
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a very large vessel at all.

10:16.465 --> 10:17.907
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cramped.

10:17.927 --> 10:21.051
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of what your all's duty was,

10:21.284 --> 10:24.327
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were aboard that in 1949 in the early 50s?

10:25.208 --> 10:29.413
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my duty was as a dentist.

10:29.433 --> 10:32.397
[SPEAKER_01]: I was to take care of the passengers that we took.

10:32.477 --> 10:41.847
[SPEAKER_01]: We were dependent transport at that time and also a supply ship for the bases like Guantanamo Bay.

10:42.008 --> 10:50.397
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would leave Norfolk and go up to New York and pick up supplies and people, come back down to Guantanamo Bay.

10:50.782 --> 11:01.352
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had people there that were in the Navy and had dependents that came down to stay with them.

11:01.372 --> 11:06.478
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went on down to Trinidad, which is off of the coast of Venezuela.

11:07.619 --> 11:16.047
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went over to Panama, Cocosola, and we had very limited duty there.

11:16.263 --> 11:24.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocosolo was, at that time, was a hot spot for the people who didn't like service men.

11:24.484 --> 11:30.759
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we couldn't go in and just have a good time or anything.

11:30.779 --> 11:33.867
[SPEAKER_01]: But then from there, we'd come back up

11:34.572 --> 11:45.247
[SPEAKER_01]: go back home to Norfolk, Virginia and repack the ship and get our orders and take off again and go be gone for about a month.

11:45.347 --> 11:50.014
[SPEAKER_00]: For about a month at a time you were gone, whether it was taking supplies and taking dependents.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.918
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about Trinidad when you were

11:53.489 --> 11:57.295
[SPEAKER_00]: Floating the Caribbean, you talked about Trinidad being a very cosmopolitan city.

11:57.315 --> 11:58.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very much so.

11:59.138 --> 12:06.289
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been to New York before several times, and it was a cosmopolitan city.

12:06.309 --> 12:14.562
[SPEAKER_01]: But Trinidad, the Port of Spain in Trinidad, you had one place you could go right next door.

12:14.582 --> 12:21.673
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be a Chinese place, a Japanese place, all sorts of countries down the road.

12:22.143 --> 12:25.146
[SPEAKER_01]: they just treated everybody just like they were friends.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.329
[SPEAKER_01]: We enjoyed that.

12:27.349 --> 12:36.338
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd go up with the natives up and watch them dance till four o'clock in the morning and wonder how they got to work the next morning.

12:37.019 --> 12:44.167
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found out later the way their seeker was taking a four hour siesta and a nap after lunch.

12:44.187 --> 12:45.188
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a great idea.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.309
[SPEAKER_00]: We could learn from that.

12:46.950 --> 12:47.270
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.

12:47.751 --> 12:48.792
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the,

12:49.514 --> 12:57.405
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ports that you visited was Puerto Rico, and sort of the things that you saw there that were really sort of sad.

12:58.967 --> 13:09.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Rico, when we first came into the bank and went down to our port where we were to deliver supplies and some people,

13:10.456 --> 13:16.202
[SPEAKER_01]: As we went along, on the one side was hills, and on the other side was the beach.

13:16.402 --> 13:32.198
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the beach, which was about, oh, I'd say 50 feet wide, you could see big cardboard boxes for refrigerators or washing machines and things of that size.

13:32.218 --> 13:33.439
[SPEAKER_01]: People were living there.

13:33.459 --> 13:35.721
[SPEAKER_01]: That was their home.

13:35.701 --> 13:39.706
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I'd ever seen that many people homeless.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.608
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

13:41.628 --> 13:57.987
[SPEAKER_00]: Being on the USS President Adams, you were talking about some of the dependents that were on the ship, on the transport ship, and some of them had not been on a ship before, and they weren't used to some of the rough seas, and you yourself had to get used to that too, especially as a dentist.

13:58.468 --> 14:03.534
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there were times that you had your hands in people's mouth that it wasn't all that smooth, right?

14:03.554 --> 14:04.375
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

14:05.047 --> 14:16.046
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were working while we were out at sea, you had to be very, very careful because the ship could float real quick.

14:16.126 --> 14:18.150
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you hit a big, big wave.

14:18.571 --> 14:19.232
[SPEAKER_01]: It would go up.

14:20.154 --> 14:26.845
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a normal that normally it traveled just like an automobile.

14:26.905 --> 14:28.388
[SPEAKER_01]: You were just riding.

14:28.840 --> 14:38.293
[SPEAKER_01]: But boy, it was dangerous when you were working because when it went, you either went with it or you caused a lot of problems in the mouth.

14:38.434 --> 14:49.229
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was very fortunate that most of the patients I worked on were good patients and let me do the work that needed to be done.

14:49.830 --> 14:54.156
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was on board ship, I haven't heard any different.

14:54.558 --> 15:06.029
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time I came off of the ship, I had set a record for taking care of a number of people that went with us and also of the ship crew.

15:06.870 --> 15:23.565
[SPEAKER_01]: When we would hit port back in Norfolk, if they had some bad work to be done, I'd send them over to the dental clinic at Norfolk so there wouldn't be any chance of them getting injured anymore.

15:24.006 --> 15:24.126
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

15:24.342 --> 15:31.308
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that were, the dependents, the families that were on the USS President Adams.

15:31.909 --> 15:40.176
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of your duties or your jobs besides performing dentistry was really to just sort of be a counselor, be a friend to these people.

15:40.196 --> 15:43.059
[SPEAKER_00]: And you met a lot of different interesting people.

15:43.119 --> 15:44.500
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.

15:44.560 --> 15:53.488
[SPEAKER_01]: The first trip we went, when we went to New York, the first people, the person that we picked up was a woman that

15:53.924 --> 16:01.017
[SPEAKER_01]: who had lost her father who lived in New York and she was from Guantanamo Bay.

16:01.037 --> 16:08.490
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we just became friends and then we

16:09.128 --> 16:15.699
[SPEAKER_01]: The people in Guantanamo Bay, the naval station there, accepted us pretty good too.

16:16.360 --> 16:24.333
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would have, when our ship would come to Guantanamo Bay, she would usually have four or five of the officers out for dinner.

16:24.353 --> 16:31.845
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had a little one-year-old and a two-year-old that could swim better than the people.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.769
[SPEAKER_01]: that could swim better than I could actually.

16:34.789 --> 16:39.816
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they'd just dive in the water and go zoom it across there and come back.

16:40.757 --> 16:42.199
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing to me.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.182
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

16:44.202 --> 16:45.224
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of pictures.

16:45.404 --> 16:50.631
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about that the USS President Adams had been a transport ship in World War II.

16:50.671 --> 16:51.412
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.

16:51.452 --> 16:56.199
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ship that you served on for a couple of years.

16:56.219 --> 16:58.041
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell, this is a transport ship.

16:58.061 --> 17:01.326
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of room to move around.

17:01.829 --> 17:04.532
[SPEAKER_00]: At least up on top deck, anyway.

17:04.552 --> 17:05.953
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, down below, yeah.

17:06.073 --> 17:10.458
[SPEAKER_01]: It went down about three or four flights.

17:11.278 --> 17:24.772
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a close-up photograph of the... During the actual fighting over in the Pacific, this was a troop transport that carried about 3,000 troops on it at one time.

17:24.792 --> 17:25.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

17:25.593 --> 17:28.456
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just were stacked on the whole thing.

17:28.596 --> 17:30.958
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting from one place to another.

17:30.938 --> 17:34.281
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this photograph is not on the President Adams.

17:34.301 --> 17:39.947
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a personal picture that I took at a recent visit to the USS Lexington in Corpus Christi.

17:40.267 --> 17:48.855
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only include this just to give people kind of an idea of what a dental exam room looks like on a Navy vessel.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.339
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was on the Lexington, the USS Lexington.

17:52.359 --> 17:57.604
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that this probably didn't look anything like your exam room, but you can see sort of the equipment from back then

17:57.584 --> 17:59.247
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cramped quarters, right?

17:59.267 --> 18:01.752
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very, very much so.

18:01.912 --> 18:03.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

18:03.936 --> 18:06.020
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have a whole lot of operatories.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.825
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, on the board of our ship, we had one.

18:09.126 --> 18:09.887
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

18:09.907 --> 18:14.657
[SPEAKER_01]: And you worked on a patient, and then they got up, and another one sat out in the chair later.

18:14.877 --> 18:15.458
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

18:15.607 --> 18:17.869
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I saw in that picture was the old Spit Basin.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.311
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we still got the old Spit Basin.

18:19.331 --> 18:23.715
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that's never changed, right?

18:24.075 --> 18:31.383
[SPEAKER_00]: After the USS President Adams, then you were assigned to Corpus Christi to the Naval Air Station.

18:31.423 --> 18:37.389
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a duty that you particularly liked, but you did serve for a time there as the dentist on base there.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.370
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that duty.

18:38.790 --> 18:42.234
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that duty was a lot different than the Norfolk.

18:42.314 --> 18:44.736
[SPEAKER_01]: At Norfolk, we had duty

18:45.070 --> 18:52.144
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were on what we called on duty, you could go home after five o'clock and stay.

18:52.224 --> 18:59.198
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they had an emergency, one of the corpsmen would call you and he would either take care of it there

19:00.207 --> 19:13.320
[SPEAKER_01]: get them to come in the next morning, or if it was real severe pain, we would have to come in to ride the streetcar over to the base and go in to work on them.

19:13.800 --> 19:28.915
[SPEAKER_01]: In Corpus Christi, though, the captain of the dental clinic there wanted everybody to be regular Navy, wear uniforms and stand examinations

19:29.553 --> 19:30.621
[SPEAKER_01]: for it and everything.

19:31.306 --> 19:35.597
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had the duty, you stayed on base.

19:36.185 --> 19:38.568
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife was pregnant with Gordon Jr.

19:38.848 --> 19:48.359
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were living with a classmate of mine that had been in the Navy and was still stationed down there.

19:48.379 --> 19:50.501
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was getting out.

19:50.521 --> 19:54.866
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got out and left us an apartment for about three months.

19:54.927 --> 19:59.712
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got out and went to San Marcos to live.

19:59.692 --> 20:00.313
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.936
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on base for about three months, like you said, in the early 50s.

20:04.317 --> 20:09.962
[SPEAKER_00]: You stayed in the reserves, though, and you eventually actually retired, I guess, from the reserves in 1963.

20:10.262 --> 20:13.926
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 years in all serving in the Navy.

20:13.946 --> 20:21.353
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's move on past that because, like you said, you moved to San Marcos where your parents had moved from Laredo when you were in dental school.

20:21.373 --> 20:22.094
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?

20:22.114 --> 20:22.374
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

20:22.435 --> 20:23.456
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where Gordon Jr.

20:24.076 --> 20:25.458
[SPEAKER_00]: was born.

20:25.478 --> 20:25.918
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

20:25.938 --> 20:27.960
[SPEAKER_00]: But you decided to move.

20:28.447 --> 20:33.323
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first choice was to go back to Dallas, but that was just too expensive, so tell us where you ended up.

20:33.344 --> 20:41.190
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up in the big town of Mahale, which at that particular time when I moved there,

20:41.812 --> 20:49.491
[SPEAKER_01]: had the population sign on, you know, where the state puts how many in there, of about 7,300.

20:49.571 --> 20:56.548
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I went through there two years ago, they still had the same sign of 7,300.

20:56.809 --> 20:59.736
[SPEAKER_01]: I had found out though that

21:00.070 --> 21:10.602
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 1920s, when the oil fields were really hitting Texas, they had over 27,000 people there in and around Mejia.

21:11.743 --> 21:16.889
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't stay long as soon as the oil shut down when they left it.

21:18.571 --> 21:23.496
[SPEAKER_01]: We had lots of good friends there.

21:25.703 --> 21:32.567
[SPEAKER_01]: I had met Dr. Ritchie, and when I got out of the service, he had asked me to come by and see him.

21:32.969 --> 21:38.127
[SPEAKER_01]: He was thinking about taking in somebody, and it ended up, when I got up here,

21:38.495 --> 21:42.438
[SPEAKER_01]: told me, well, he was taking in his cousin, Tom King.

21:43.319 --> 21:52.487
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tom was wanting to go to dental school and get his graduate degree in orthodontics.

21:53.588 --> 21:59.052
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to just turn his office over to all his patients to me.

21:59.072 --> 22:08.080
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1957, we ended up moving down here and I took over Tom King's practice.

22:08.060 --> 22:13.027
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ritchie and I had four operatories that we shared.

22:13.047 --> 22:16.992
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he hired a dental hygienist and gave her one of them.

22:17.833 --> 22:27.526
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just bumping shoulders all the time to use a third operatories for emergencies and examinations and things.

22:28.327 --> 22:33.814
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one day I went in to him and I said, you know, we're kind of crowded here.

22:33.854 --> 22:36.598
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, Dr. Ritchie,

22:36.578 --> 22:37.940
[SPEAKER_01]: who was a great guy.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.122
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really great.

22:39.142 --> 22:39.823
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Howard Ritchie.

22:39.843 --> 22:40.744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

22:40.764 --> 22:51.239
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, Gordon, he said, we're to the point where we're either going to have to build on the building here or if you do what you want to do.

22:52.401 --> 22:54.724
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, well, I believe I'm going to move.

22:55.145 --> 22:59.211
[SPEAKER_01]: So I called Bill Fitch, who had gone to school.

22:59.444 --> 23:05.637
[SPEAKER_01]: with my older brother and graduated from Woodrow also in Dallas.

23:05.657 --> 23:10.487
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was down here building apartments and selling land.

23:10.928 --> 23:14.736
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sold me the lot on the other end of this Mary Lake.

23:14.716 --> 23:21.303
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Fitch owned a lot of land in our town, and he had a lot for you, right, over on Mary Lake.

23:21.563 --> 23:40.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so on the corner of Mary Lake and Hollickley, and so I bought the lake, I mean, bought the area there and built my building and a parking lot behind the building for staff and a little parking area out in front.

23:40.501 --> 23:49.372
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the street from me lived the state representative Brown.

23:51.135 --> 23:54.459
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got tickled at him.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.261
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go home and laugh about it.

23:56.321 --> 23:58.164
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really funny, and yet it was.

23:58.564 --> 23:59.846
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd come over every time.

23:59.866 --> 24:06.154
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd put a big pile of used logs that they didn't use all of them.

24:06.320 --> 24:11.435
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd put them out in the back and he'd come over the next day, when are you going to move these off?

24:12.056 --> 24:19.738
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally I said, look, as soon as we get this building completed,

24:20.377 --> 24:26.283
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get the grounds here looking good, which I did.

24:26.303 --> 24:29.526
[SPEAKER_00]: You moved into the home that you're still living in, Brian, in 1959.

24:29.546 --> 24:30.487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24:31.588 --> 24:34.932
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and Margaret raised your family there, three girls and two boys.

24:34.992 --> 24:40.057
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned Donna and Gordon, also Betty Ann, who's a hygienist, and Paul and Shea.

24:40.818 --> 24:41.939
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your children.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.722
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost Margaret in 2007, I know.

24:44.742 --> 24:50.147
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved into our new church up on Cambridge Road at Cambridge Drive.

24:51.173 --> 24:53.896
[SPEAKER_01]: on her birthday in 2007.

24:53.996 --> 25:02.805
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a Sunday.

25:04.147 --> 25:12.135
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we moved in, of course, everybody could barely get in because of the new church.

25:12.175 --> 25:17.441
[SPEAKER_01]: And she leaned over to me and says, well, our preacher will be moving on pretty soon.

25:18.242 --> 25:20.404
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, at the end of the week,

25:21.380 --> 25:29.488
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim said he wanted to go back to the original church up above Wichita Falls.

25:31.050 --> 25:34.173
[SPEAKER_01]: She laughed about it and I said, how did you know he was going to move?

25:34.233 --> 25:40.699
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, well, every time we added on or built anything in our church, says the preacher always moves pretty soon.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.782
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a mighty big church.

25:45.444 --> 25:49.328
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just got a couple of minutes left and I promised that we would talk about the trip that

25:49.308 --> 25:56.299
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got to take with you and about 100 other veterans back in May of 2010, the Lone Star Honor Flight.

25:56.339 --> 26:01.426
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great 24-hour adventure where we went from here to Washington, D.C.

26:01.446 --> 26:04.371
[SPEAKER_00]: and back, and we got to see a lot of wonderful things.

26:04.391 --> 26:06.253
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about your memories of that trip.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.958
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a trip that really surprised me.

26:09.398 --> 26:17.931
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to Washington several times, but I never had been out in the Memorial Park or Arlington Cemetery.

26:19.210 --> 26:24.978
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, very enjoyable, very surprising, though, how many people would come up.

26:24.998 --> 26:37.917
[SPEAKER_01]: I was being pushed in a wheelchair by Dr. Hall, who was my guardian, and he said, you're not going to walk except where you just have to, which to get on the planes, you have to take your shoes off.

26:37.937 --> 26:43.885
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they don't take your pants off, too, after the guy tried to blow up the plane.

26:44.152 --> 26:53.485
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he pushed me all around there and we had a wonderful time.

26:53.825 --> 26:56.229
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was a memorable 24 hours.

26:56.249 --> 26:57.130
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was.

26:57.330 --> 27:03.799
[SPEAKER_01]: We left here at 3.30 one morning and got back at 3.30 the next morning.

27:03.819 --> 27:04.240
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.042
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you what.

27:06.022 --> 27:09.267
[SPEAKER_01]: We hardly had time to snooze any moment.

27:10.248 --> 27:13.253
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a very, very wonderful thing.

27:13.313 --> 27:20.624
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say enough about the people at Continental Airlines that flew us up there.

27:20.704 --> 27:23.088
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us a breakfast and a supper.

27:23.228 --> 27:23.909
[SPEAKER_00]: And a steak dinner.

27:24.149 --> 27:25.431
[SPEAKER_01]: And a steak dinner.

27:25.411 --> 27:29.660
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of time, but it was a great time and it was great to be on that trip with you and the rest of them.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.286
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me on your program.

27:32.306 --> 27:33.228
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

27:33.990 --> 27:40.504
[SPEAKER_00]: During his time on board the USS President Adams, Gordon Pratt best recalls the people he met, like he said.

27:40.524 --> 27:44.432
[SPEAKER_00]: And in four decades of taking care of people's teeth in the Brazos Valley,

27:44.412 --> 27:49.062
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of people he met and knows and who know and love him has only grown.

27:49.082 --> 27:51.508
[SPEAKER_00]: We salute him for not only his service in the U.S.

27:51.528 --> 27:56.960
[SPEAKER_00]: Navy for 20 years, but his service to our health for 40 years in the Brazos Valley.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.303
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tom Turbyville.

27:58.323 --> 28:01.871
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:01.891 --> 28:13.457
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
