WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:02.620
Are you there Charlie?

00:02.920 --> 00:03.540
Yeah, I'm here bro.

00:03.660 --> 00:04.940
Okay, great.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.940
I guess now to get back on track.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.180
Signal's still good.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.720
Chronologically, yeah.

00:11.080 --> 00:11.960
Signal's still good.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.220
Okay, the Catalyst.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.200
And you've mentioned a little bit about that.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.200
Again, it's a patent on all your story,

00:20.340 --> 00:21.320
kind of your new style.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.560
And it reminded me a little bit of the rose

00:23.560 --> 00:26.260
in that it had this unfinished musical piece in it.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.680
Music must mean a lot to you

00:29.220 --> 00:30.940
to write about it so much.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
Yeah, I love it.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.680
I cannot play an instrument,

00:34.560 --> 00:37.900
but I've great many of my stories,

00:38.480 --> 00:40.340
at least in recent years,

00:42.160 --> 00:44.240
have music plays a part in it.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.320
In fact, sometimes the plot turns on it.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.440
I had a funny one in analog, H-Tech.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.960
I don't know whether you read that or not.

00:53.140 --> 00:53.900
Yes, I've read it.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.420
Well, you may recall there that the guy

00:56.420 --> 00:58.440
deliberately went to hell

00:59.480 --> 01:02.960
so that he could sit on the burning shores

01:02.960 --> 01:05.580
and watch the blue flames

01:05.580 --> 01:08.480
in the burning brimstone.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.500
Because all of that,

01:12.760 --> 01:16.420
all the forgotten and unfinished music

01:17.200 --> 01:20.320
of the entire world had been sent there.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.660
And he particularly wanted to hear

01:23.660 --> 01:26.000
Beethoven's 10th Symphony,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.900
which Beethoven never got to write,

01:30.820 --> 01:32.340
except in bits and pieces.

01:33.420 --> 01:36.520
And also Schubert's Unfinished part,

01:37.400 --> 01:39.880
Schubert's Unfinished Symphony was there,

01:40.400 --> 01:41.560
and several other things.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.000
So, of course, I had to work in a patent angle

01:47.000 --> 01:50.460
and a legal angle to make it saleable,

01:50.560 --> 01:51.940
but that was the guts of it.

01:53.340 --> 01:56.300
Just watching the flames turn out

01:56.300 --> 01:58.060
all this wonderful music.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.200
And then the Venetian court,

02:06.320 --> 02:08.420
one of the critical things,

02:08.460 --> 02:11.780
turns on Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony,

02:12.920 --> 02:15.600
the opening chords, the fate thing.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.240
And, well, there are other things,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.980
but the young love music.

02:24.260 --> 02:27.960
Oh, I should mention another thing.

02:28.840 --> 02:36.080
The catalyst, at one time, was a general novel,

02:36.800 --> 02:38.460
really about my brother Billy,

02:39.180 --> 02:41.740
really about me and my mother,

02:42.640 --> 02:43.940
and life in Fort Worth,

02:44.940 --> 02:47.220
and life in the Red Light District,

02:47.220 --> 02:49.300
and life in the police department.

02:52.700 --> 02:56.120
And one of the stories there involved

02:57.440 --> 02:59.160
a peculiar whistle,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.780
which was derived from

03:02.880 --> 03:07.700
Tchaikovsky's Safely Graze by Johann Sebastian Bach.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.400
But that long version never sold,

03:11.700 --> 03:13.840
and I thought, well, I'm not going to let it die.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.740
I will convert it to a science fiction book

03:16.740 --> 03:19.200
with all the proper trappings

03:19.200 --> 03:23.260
and things you need to call it science fiction,

03:23.880 --> 03:26.700
which I did, but I couldn't put in Bach.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.540
So I put in this thing about the opera

03:32.540 --> 03:34.320
and the unfinished,

03:34.980 --> 03:37.160
well, it was an unfinished opera,

03:37.540 --> 03:38.320
what do you want,

03:39.880 --> 03:41.780
and the prophet, and so on.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.240
So music was there too.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.780
The only biographical information I've ever seen on you

03:51.780 --> 03:53.440
was in Damon Knight's Orbit 4,

03:53.540 --> 03:56.220
and it said something about working in a police department

03:56.220 --> 03:58.120
and something about a Red Light District and all that.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.000
So that must be, I guess that's the only thing that's known about you

04:02.000 --> 04:03.780
other than what we're finding out right now.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.680
Well, yeah, my first job was in the Red Light District in Fort Worth.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.300
I worked there for three years, three very happy years.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.560
And I never availed myself of the facilities

04:18.560 --> 04:20.400
of the young ladies up the street,

04:20.960 --> 04:23.580
but I knew they were there,

04:23.820 --> 04:25.360
and I said good morning to them,

04:25.760 --> 04:27.320
and they said good morning to me,

04:28.320 --> 04:32.660
and the corner house, the big house of the main madam

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
had a little sandwich shop.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.560
They had the cleanest and best food in the area,

04:39.720 --> 04:43.340
so all the boys in the warehouse went up there for their lunch,

04:43.920 --> 04:44.740
including me.

04:47.140 --> 04:51.940
So there it was, and it was a lot of fun.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.240
And the police department, similarly,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.740
I worked for them for a year in the Fingerprint Bureau,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.900
and that was an education.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.160
Did you finish your undergraduate degree at TCU by any chance?

05:10.300 --> 05:12.360
No, here's what happened there, Bill.

05:13.300 --> 05:16.520
My first couple of years there were at night,

05:17.720 --> 05:21.920
and I had a ministerial scholarship in the Bright College of the Bible.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.560
And as I may have mentioned to you,

05:25.840 --> 05:29.500
we parted company, at least the Bright College, and I did,

05:30.040 --> 05:32.840
but I went back anyhow on another scholarship,

05:35.040 --> 05:37.860
and I took some more work in the daytime,

05:38.640 --> 05:41.240
and I worked at the police department at night.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.720
Then I moved to Washington,

05:43.720 --> 05:49.780
and I did get my BS in chemistry from George Washington University,

05:50.920 --> 05:53.640
and that was in 1942,

05:55.500 --> 06:02.540
and in 1946 I got my LLB in law and passed the bar,

06:03.820 --> 06:06.360
and all of this was part-time work,

06:07.440 --> 06:09.360
and it took me a while to get it.

06:10.780 --> 06:14.060
So I did not get a degree at TCU,

06:14.700 --> 06:17.280
but I met my wife there,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.500
and I met her in high school in Fort Worth,

06:19.960 --> 06:24.800
and she and I went to TCU together.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.080
We rode the same bus every once in a while,

06:28.280 --> 06:31.560
and it was understood that when I came to Washington

06:32.120 --> 06:35.940
that we would get married as soon as possible, which we finally did.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.680
And that's part of history.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.920
I'm glad I asked about that,

06:43.920 --> 06:46.940
although it got me off the track on the catalyst,

06:47.120 --> 06:49.260
I'll get back on, but that's fascinating.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.980
The thing I liked about the catalyst,

06:53.220 --> 06:57.560
one of the things was that you showed the day-to-day operation of an R&D unit,

06:57.700 --> 07:01.880
both from the research scientist point of view and the lawyer's point of view.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.640
Most science fiction books always look at the head of the department

07:05.640 --> 07:09.600
or the brilliant young researcher that doesn't have these kinds of day-to-day problems,

07:09.600 --> 07:13.980
not only technical problems, but political problems as well.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.260
So you must have felt right at home when you were writing that with your background.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.020
Yes, I saw it all happen.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.580
I changed the names, of course, except for one.

07:26.620 --> 07:33.660
The hero was a man that I knew very well, a brilliant man, a great chemist.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.560
His real name was John Stone Sennott Mackay.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.680
Of course, in the book I call him John Stone Sinclair Serene,

07:44.100 --> 07:46.940
but he was a real man and he was the inventor.

07:48.320 --> 07:53.780
And he got all the things done to him that were mentioned there,

07:54.640 --> 07:58.720
and he did leave, but he made this marvelous invention.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.360
Meanwhile, and it did get into Interference.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.280
None of the other characters were real at all.

08:07.760 --> 08:14.360
The bad guys, they were not the same ones that did things to him.

08:17.640 --> 08:24.260
Speaking of which, how did your peers in industry take your writing?

08:24.440 --> 08:28.240
Let's say later on at this time, whenever these patent lawyer stories came out,

08:28.240 --> 08:32.140
did the people at Grace Reed it and your friends and acquaintances read it,

08:32.240 --> 08:33.480
and how did they react to it?

08:33.680 --> 08:38.780
Well, they read it all right there, but they didn't know just how to react.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.900
They would say, I read your story and then wait until I was going to say something,

08:44.040 --> 08:45.100
but I wouldn't say anything.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.640
I read your book.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.760
The catalyst, I guess, of all of these excited the most reaction.

08:54.980 --> 09:03.280
I had calls from all over the place, all over the country, asking about it.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.600
Am I in it?

09:04.760 --> 09:06.980
I'd say, no, you're not in it.

09:07.960 --> 09:13.280
Especially from Connecticut, and people who were on that program, but at long-century times.

09:14.680 --> 09:21.120
And of course, Johnny MacIus, bought dozens of copies and circulated them all over the country.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.540
He's dead now.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.340
He's got a cancer of the jaw.

09:29.180 --> 09:33.500
So there was a reaction, but nobody complained about it.

09:34.080 --> 09:39.020
One of my neighbors here in the little development where I live, asked me,

09:40.140 --> 09:46.380
I was still working for Grace after that, and I said, yeah, they know I'm going to retire next year,

09:46.940 --> 09:48.980
so they just are going to wait for a lot.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.280
Maybe they'll do.

09:56.980 --> 10:02.420
Okay, next came Firebird, which was, again, I call it a throwback just for lack of a better word,

10:02.460 --> 10:07.860
but it was back in your old style, although as we talked about it, it uses the more modern cosmology.

10:08.400 --> 10:13.140
And again, you kind of concluded that the universe is sentient,

10:13.880 --> 10:16.640
and I guess that was the mystical part of this.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.200
And you also pulled off the biggest rebirth in your career because you had the whole universe,

10:21.420 --> 10:23.220
the whole big bang to worry about now.

10:24.580 --> 10:30.060
Yeah, well, I'm sure you recognize the basic story here.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.360
This is Tristan and his shoulder.

10:33.900 --> 10:44.520
I don't know whether you go in for Wagner or not, but it is his shoulder and Tristan drinking,

10:44.520 --> 10:52.420
what she thinks is the poison drink, but it's his lovely lecture again, and they fall in love.

10:53.140 --> 10:59.820
And after that, just about everything parallels the Tristan and his shoulder story,

10:59.920 --> 11:09.040
as you would find it in Wagner's opera, including Death at the End, and the flight.

11:10.180 --> 11:11.940
Well, I'll change it a little bit.

11:14.520 --> 11:26.840
In the beginning, when I first wrote David Hartwell's pocket book, I should mention he is a medieval scholar.

11:27.060 --> 11:30.840
This is what he got his PhD in English in.

11:31.880 --> 11:40.580
And he was quite familiar with the Tristan legend from there, and he found Welsh origins for it,

11:41.500 --> 11:45.140
and he hadn't changed the names, they look like Welsh names.

11:46.440 --> 11:53.820
And he said, make him more of a Renaissance knight, while putting some chuffs, which is easy enough,

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
or something that looked like a chuffkin.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.420
I worked it into the plot, it came out okay.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.460
But it is a never-contempt, and they'll still make their contribution.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.960
That spawns another question.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.720
I keep saying I only have two more questions, but it spawns another one.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.960
Chess has appeared quite notably, especially in the short stories.

12:18.140 --> 12:20.660
I assume you're a fan of the game.

12:21.300 --> 12:26.080
Well, I've played at least another year, I believe.

12:26.460 --> 12:27.240
And I still do.

12:27.340 --> 12:31.900
I read a book of chess combinations nearly every night.

12:32.080 --> 12:32.820
It puts me to sleep.

12:34.900 --> 12:38.540
Various brilliances of some of the past masters.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.940
It's an exciting thing.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.080
I used to play a lot more than I do now.

12:45.220 --> 12:51.340
We used to have a chess club back at Sinomidd, and also one at Grace.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.560
But these things have long gone.

12:57.260 --> 13:02.680
I do love the game, and there are occasions when I can work it into a story,

13:03.280 --> 13:04.840
and if I can find one, I will.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.880
Okay, then the Venetian court.

13:09.060 --> 13:13.660
The Venetian court appeared as a short story, and then, I guess, later as a fix-up.

13:14.140 --> 13:17.380
This was the first, as a fix-up to a novel.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.180
This was the first time I'd noticed that you'd done that, written a short story,

13:21.320 --> 13:22.880
and then extended to the novel.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.000
It was really sort of a travel-ep.

13:26.720 --> 13:35.560
I would say about 40,000 words as it appeared in analog, and then I expanded it to 60,000.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.980
So, certainly it was expanded.

13:39.140 --> 13:42.140
It was changed a little bit, but basically it's the same thing.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.620
And it is the first time I've done anything like that.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.540
It is based on a novel from a prior work.

13:52.080 --> 13:59.120
Okay, tell me what you're working on now, if you have any plans for publishing in the near future.

13:59.920 --> 14:06.240
Well, I have some items circulating right now, and I'm not working on anything right now.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.600
I'm going to take it easy for a few weeks.

14:12.320 --> 14:17.600
The things that I have circulating, I have a novel, science fiction novel,

14:18.960 --> 14:23.860
which has been turned down at least once, and I don't know whether it will ever sell.

14:24.520 --> 14:30.640
This has to do with the impact of a religion founded on Edgar Allen's poem,

14:32.100 --> 14:41.420
and its impact on an alien invasion from another galaxy.

14:45.500 --> 14:51.280
And that one, or it's called The Raven, it's of course based on the soul of the Raven.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.440
But that one is, as you say, a pick-up.

14:57.940 --> 15:07.380
It's a big expansion of a short story which I've sold to Harlan Ellison to be published in Glass Dangerous Visions.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.220
How long ago was that?

15:09.220 --> 15:20.880
This was 1970, oh, it's the 75 or 76th. He hasn't published it.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.080
Yeah, so I noticed.

15:22.820 --> 15:30.200
But I didn't want it to go to waste, so I expanded it to this thing, which may never be published either.

15:31.380 --> 15:38.900
Then I have one, two, three, four short stories.

15:40.880 --> 15:48.960
One deals with computers, one deals with Robert E. Lee and a visitor from the future.

15:49.840 --> 15:59.780
One deals with, let me think, just a little examination of muscular physics and falling down a well truck.

16:01.460 --> 16:09.420
And one, I just sent out last Saturday, the day before yesterday.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.760
Let me see, what is it about?

16:19.900 --> 16:24.820
My memory is failing me, Bill. I don't know what is, kind of, anything.

16:26.040 --> 16:36.580
Oh yeah, it has to do with a system for disposing of nuclear waste into one of the planets, the solar system.

16:38.020 --> 16:45.280
And it's a little exciting. I had to work out the physics of escaping from the moon of Jupiter.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.600
So we'll see how that one goes.

16:50.180 --> 16:56.020
Okay, I'm glad to hear that you're still putting things out. I look forward to it.

16:56.480 --> 17:02.140
Let me ask you this then. How do you want to be remembered as a science fiction writer?

17:02.420 --> 17:04.320
What do you want people to remember about your work?

17:07.960 --> 17:20.300
My request there is, please forget me, let me sink into oblivion, let the waves wash up over the sand, and everything is a book.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.600
Honest to God.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.960
Okay. Do you ever wish that you could have done it full time?

17:28.960 --> 17:34.500
Had the inherited money or something so you didn't have to worry about making bacon?

17:36.040 --> 17:41.320
Did you enjoy your other work enough that the writing as a pastime was satisfying?

17:41.960 --> 17:49.520
Yeah, I write my other work. It was a lot of fun being a patent attorney, working with inventors that really knew their stuff,

17:49.520 --> 17:59.220
and taking what they invented and getting it down into English and borrowing it with a patent office, battling with a patent office to get the patent.

17:59.860 --> 18:07.240
That was fun. And I don't think I would want to trade that for a professional life of writing science fiction.

18:07.960 --> 18:14.960
Whether it were that way. Now, writing science fiction is work. The other is not.

18:19.200 --> 18:31.280
Okay. That as far as my list of questions, that's it. I can't tell you enough how much I enjoyed it and that you consider to be interviewed.

18:32.200 --> 18:38.820
Well, I'm always glad to talk to anybody that's interested in stuff I've written.

18:38.820 --> 18:49.240
Oh, I am. Let me ask you a favor, which please feel free to turn down if you'd rather not do it. May I send you my books to be autographed?

18:49.900 --> 18:54.880
I will send the postage and all that good stuff. Would that be any problem?

18:55.140 --> 18:56.500
I would be happy to do it.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.180
Oh, I thank you. That will...

18:58.180 --> 19:01.040
You might get a little indication of what you would like me to say.

19:01.040 --> 19:09.120
Okay. I do appreciate that. That would mean very much to me. I have been a fan of yours for... Well, I'm only 34, so I can't be that long.

19:09.460 --> 19:18.500
But ever since I found the Ring of Riternal in 1971 or so, then I found the Rose. And I've read the Rose probably eight times.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.840
And I don't have time to read...

19:20.840 --> 19:21.800
You're over-daggered.

19:21.800 --> 19:31.460
Well, I still get something out of it. It just really means a lot to me. And I don't have the luxury of reading anything more than once.

19:31.540 --> 19:39.140
I don't read anything else once, but I read that about once every year just to get it again. I wish it would get back in print.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.660
I've got a whole bunch of copies of it, but I don't lend them to friends.

19:44.520 --> 19:51.380
Well, okay. I'm very gratifying to see if it meant something to somebody.

19:51.540 --> 20:00.140
It very much did. Charlie, thanks again. It's been really great. And you take care and keep on writing. Look forward to seeing what you put out.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.180
Okay, Bill.

20:01.260 --> 20:04.080
And I'll get you my books pretty quick, and I sure appreciate that.

20:04.380 --> 20:04.720
Okay.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.620
Bye-bye now.
