00:01.720 --> 00:03.260
So, let it roll David.

00:07.960 --> 00:11.920
Okay, David, he needs to check your voice one more time if you can maybe count to five

00:11.920 --> 00:12.360
or so.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.860
Four score in seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, etc.

00:18.500 --> 00:18.860
Okay.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.520
Does that do it?

00:20.720 --> 00:21.780
Yeah, he said it looks good.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.160
Are we ready?

00:26.660 --> 00:27.000
Yes.

00:27.420 --> 00:27.900
Okay.

00:27.900 --> 00:28.080
Okay.

00:29.800 --> 00:35.200
First of all, Mr. DeCamp, we wondered just a little bit about your origins as a writer

00:35.200 --> 00:40.660
back in the late 1930s, such things as, or the circumstances that caused you to start

00:40.660 --> 00:40.980
writing.

00:42.380 --> 00:53.260
Well, in 1937 and eight, I was working in Scranton, Pennsylvania as principal of the

00:53.260 --> 00:57.500
school of inventing and patenting of the International Correspondence School.

00:58.640 --> 01:06.040
And I had a friend in New York, an old college roommate of mine named John Clark, who was

01:06.040 --> 01:08.200
out of a job and looking for one.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.800
And in order to continue to eat, he, who was a more faithful reader of the science fiction

01:13.800 --> 01:19.540
magazine than I was at that time, wrote a couple of stories.

01:20.280 --> 01:27.840
And I used to come in once twice a month in New York, and I'd stay at his apartment and

01:27.840 --> 01:31.800
we'd sit up late and plot a couple of these stories.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.000
So I gave him some help with them.

01:34.580 --> 01:40.120
He sent them to F. Arlen Cremain and the editor of Astounding and to everybody's surprise,

01:40.300 --> 01:40.860
he sold them.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.480
So I thought, well, if he can do that, why can't I?

01:45.820 --> 01:50.680
So having plenty of spare time in Scranton, I wrote a couple and sent them in.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.520
And to my surprise, they were bought.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.920
Well, at that point, I said, if we, why hasn't somebody told me about this before?

01:59.200 --> 01:59.960
Sure beats working.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.240
So I wrote a few more stories and articles, sold some, didn't sell others.

02:08.620 --> 02:16.620
And then at the end of 19, let me see, it was the beginning of 1939, I was working at

02:16.620 --> 02:21.040
another job as one of the editors on a trade journal in New York.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.280
I got fired in an economy purge.

02:24.880 --> 02:30.800
So I thought, instead of fooling around with these piddling editorial jobs, why don't I

02:30.800 --> 02:31.760
try freelancing?

02:31.760 --> 02:38.600
You see, I figured that if I spent five hours a week on my own time writing and made a certain

02:38.600 --> 02:43.880
amount of money, if I could spend 50 hours a week at it, I'd make 10 times that much.

02:44.620 --> 02:49.120
Well, of course, there's a fallacy there because you soon run into a law of diminishing returns.

02:49.980 --> 02:57.900
But nevertheless, I took the plunge and found that in freelancing, I earned about as much

02:57.900 --> 02:59.280
as I had been doing.

02:59.280 --> 03:05.800
And I could be my own boss, work at my own pace, work sitting down and wear out all my

03:05.800 --> 03:06.580
old clothes.

03:07.460 --> 03:13.000
So except for a couple of temporary jobs and the Second World War, in which I was in the

03:13.000 --> 03:15.640
Naval Reserve, I've been at it ever since.

03:17.060 --> 03:17.540
Excellent.

03:17.900 --> 03:17.960
Okay.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.480
Those first couple of stories you mentioned that were published to your surprise, was

03:22.480 --> 03:23.980
one of those hyperpolosity?

03:24.440 --> 03:27.340
Yes, hyperpolosity and the isolingual.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.820
What kind of money did you get when you published those?

03:32.260 --> 03:32.920
Well, let me see.

03:33.040 --> 03:39.700
I think it was a set of word, which means I got something like 30 or 40 dollars, I suppose.

03:41.280 --> 03:48.720
Actually, if you ask me what was my first published story, that is the question that

03:48.720 --> 03:50.200
can have any one of three answers.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.080
If you mean the first one I started writing, it was the novel, Genus Homo, in collaboration

03:58.080 --> 03:59.560
with the late Skyler Miller.

04:00.500 --> 04:06.500
But that, although we started that back around 1936, took us over two years to finish it

04:06.500 --> 04:08.380
and it wasn't published on 1941.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.080
If you mean what was the first story I completed?

04:13.080 --> 04:23.400
It was a rather amateurish little caveman story called The Hairless Ones Come, the usual

04:23.400 --> 04:30.680
story about the conflict between the Andretal men and the Chromen Yards who overran Europe,

04:31.520 --> 04:32.940
the end of the Fourth Glaciation.

04:33.660 --> 04:43.420
And that was published in 1939, I believe it was, in a short live magazine of historical

04:43.420 --> 04:45.800
adventure called Golden Fleet.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.320
But that was the first one finished.

04:48.460 --> 04:52.280
Then the first one published was, I believe, the isolinguals.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.260
Okay.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.060
You obviously have a widespread reputation as a writer of humor, probably the foremost

05:02.060 --> 05:03.280
in the field of science fiction.

05:04.020 --> 05:04.440
Do you think...

05:04.440 --> 05:05.400
That's good of you to say so.

05:05.860 --> 05:08.120
Yeah, do you think of yourself as a humorist?

05:08.220 --> 05:12.440
I mean, is that a label that you want or that you agree with?

05:14.260 --> 05:24.880
Let's say that I'm not an exclusive professional humorist of the type of the Lepege Woodhouse,

05:24.880 --> 05:34.520
for example, but on the other hand, I do try to liven up most of my fiction with a generous

05:34.520 --> 05:35.600
sprinkling of humor.

05:36.420 --> 05:43.320
Of course, remember that although people generally refer to me as a science fiction writer,

05:44.220 --> 05:48.960
the reason is mainly that I made my early reputation in that field.

05:49.680 --> 05:57.860
Actually, fiction is only about half of my output, rest being science, history, biography,

05:58.360 --> 06:00.160
literary criticism, and so on.

06:01.160 --> 06:08.860
And of the fictional half, aside from five historical novels that I've written, about

06:08.860 --> 06:13.140
half is science fiction in a strict sense and half is fantasy.

06:13.140 --> 06:18.760
So only about a quarter of my output is really science fiction in a strict sense.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.540
Yeah, no, I understand that.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.780
Back to humor for just a moment.

06:26.160 --> 06:31.600
Many critics and readers and commentators, whatever, have said that science fiction and

06:31.600 --> 06:35.960
humor don't mix well with a good science fiction humor, a story or novel, is sort of a rarity.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.280
What would be your comment about that?

06:40.600 --> 06:47.100
Well, all I can say is that it is true that there aren't a great many humorous stories

06:47.100 --> 06:52.640
in that field, but then of course there aren't a great many humorous stories in any genre

06:52.640 --> 06:53.360
of fiction.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.360
Some people do it and some people don't.

06:58.520 --> 07:05.300
Now back in before the first world, the Second World War, I'm not that old quite yet, but

07:05.300 --> 07:13.900
before the Second World War, of the active science fiction writers in the country, there

07:13.900 --> 07:20.460
were only two who were considered humorous science fiction writers, and I was one and

07:20.460 --> 07:21.860
Henry Kutner was the other.

07:22.780 --> 07:31.880
Curiously enough, both Henry and I, in our private lives, were rather serious, solemn

07:31.880 --> 07:32.340
fellow.

07:38.100 --> 07:43.420
Okay, for a number of years I've been a fan of your Harold Shea stories, the ones you

07:43.420 --> 07:44.900
collaborated with Fletcher Pratt on.

07:45.220 --> 07:45.480
Yes.

07:45.820 --> 07:49.780
If I understand right now, the first one of those was the roaring trumpet published around

07:49.780 --> 07:51.140
1940 or so.

07:51.560 --> 07:51.800
Yes.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.180
Okay, how did that collaboration with Fletcher Pratt start?

07:57.640 --> 08:06.160
Fletcher Pratt was a military and naval historian, among other things, and he ran a naval war

08:06.160 --> 08:09.060
game in his apartment in New York City.

08:09.180 --> 08:14.860
Later they moved to a hired hall when the game got too large, in which people crawled

08:14.860 --> 08:21.640
around on the floor, pushing little model boats, ship warships, models of real ships,

08:21.640 --> 08:26.340
which Fletcher whittled out at his desk while he was waiting for the next sentence to come.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.520
They were made out of balsa wood and wires and pins and things.

08:33.200 --> 08:39.300
And I was also a naval buff, a regular reader of James' fighting ships and so forth, and

08:39.300 --> 08:46.760
I could tell you what was the armament of the French Terrible class, 5.5 inch guns,

08:47.000 --> 08:47.460
and so on.

08:49.020 --> 08:56.280
And so was John Clark, and he got in touch with Fletcher, being more aggressive, let

08:56.280 --> 08:58.560
us say, unless shy of an eye, in such matters.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.480
He went around and called on him and presently was enrolled in the naval war game, and then

09:03.480 --> 09:07.800
he brought me around to meet Fletcher, and I was enrolled and was a regular war game

09:07.800 --> 09:08.220
player.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.200
Well, Fletcher was at that time an established and active writer, and I was a struggling

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
young pro, you might say.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.440
So John said to me, hey, Fletcher says he would like to see you.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.080
He has an idea for some stories.

09:24.920 --> 09:31.220
So I went around to Fletcher, and he proposed that he and I collaborate on a series of stories

09:31.220 --> 09:39.980
based upon this far out theory that you can slip into any universe you want, by manipulating

09:39.980 --> 09:41.820
the symbols of symbolic logic.

09:41.820 --> 09:46.600
I had been studying symbolic logic a little bit, all its cute or simple things.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.400
So, okay, we went to it.

09:51.300 --> 09:57.600
And that is how the five Harold Shea stories originated, as well as the other practicap

09:57.600 --> 09:58.040
collaborations.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.840
One thing that's sort of interested me about that particular collaboration, it seems to

10:04.840 --> 10:07.380
me that humor is a very, I guess, a personal thing.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.520
I've always wondered how that kind of a writing process worked.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.860
For instance, did you write a story and he go over it?

10:13.940 --> 10:15.300
Did you do alternate stories?

10:15.860 --> 10:19.420
How can you, how was the actual mechanics of that?

10:19.780 --> 10:24.240
Our method of collaboration, that is to say, the one that we found that worked the best

10:24.240 --> 10:31.360
for us, was that he and I would get together on an afternoon, usually in his apartment,

10:32.360 --> 10:35.040
and thresh out story ideas.

10:35.900 --> 10:41.180
He would come up with one and I'd say, no, no, that's not logical for this or that reason.

10:42.700 --> 10:50.500
Or I'd say, well, it seems to me that that's the same storyline that Cutter had just last

10:50.500 --> 10:52.560
year, such and such a magazine.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.180
So forth and so on.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.520
And finally we get a story more or less beaten into shape.

10:56.540 --> 11:01.120
And I'd make notes in shorthand, which I had taught myself.

11:01.880 --> 11:09.780
And I'd take them home and I'd write out a synopsis of the story and submit that to

11:09.780 --> 11:13.860
Fletcher and he would make any additions or changes that he thought desirable.

11:14.080 --> 11:19.000
And I'd type the rough graft and give it to him and he would type the final graft.

11:20.180 --> 11:26.780
I have found in collaborations in general that it's usually better for the younger writer

11:26.780 --> 11:33.580
of the pair to do the rough and the older one, the final.

11:34.420 --> 11:38.860
The reason being that the younger writer is apt to have more energy and more facility,

11:39.480 --> 11:45.940
but the older one, having been around longer, has a sharper critical sense of spotting illogicalities,

11:47.960 --> 11:52.080
infelicities of expression and things of that sort, meaning them out.

11:53.420 --> 11:54.180
Very good.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.220
None of those stories had anything to do with Campbell, did it?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.660
John W. Campbell is an editor.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.660
Those were entirely separate from him, weren't they?

12:04.520 --> 12:11.020
Well, John Campbell published the first three of the Harold Shea novels.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.220
Okay, yeah, what I was getting at was this.

12:16.580 --> 12:23.980
The world of Norse mythology or any of those that you construct, the consistency of it.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.960
Harold Shea, none of his modern things work.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.820
The matches, the guns.

12:29.260 --> 12:32.460
In other words, there's an internal consistency in the world, even though magic works.

12:32.660 --> 12:33.100
That's right.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.740
Was that your own idea?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.160
Well, that was a common idea.

12:37.500 --> 12:42.620
I mean, both Fletcher and I had long since agreed that, right from the start,

12:42.620 --> 12:48.060
that the most effective is that in writing fantasy, you have to be even more careful

12:48.060 --> 12:52.580
about internal consistency than you do in writing a realistic story,

12:52.880 --> 12:57.120
because the reader's credulity is already stretched like a rubber band, you see,

12:57.180 --> 13:02.880
and if you put extra strain on it by having some obvious contradiction, it's going to snap.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.440
That point will probably stop reading.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.120
Okay, good.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.460
Right.

13:09.140 --> 13:13.400
Just my observation that a lot of the science fantasy that was being written back then,

13:13.420 --> 13:15.480
especially, did not have that kind of consistency.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.800
That is quite right.

13:17.680 --> 13:28.280
And I consider myself fairly good at following a train of logic and spotting cases where people

13:28.280 --> 13:31.220
commit inconsistencies of that sort.

13:32.100 --> 13:37.980
As for example, one colleague of mine, with whom I have collaborated,

13:39.040 --> 13:43.900
on one night he will have a full moon and on the next night he will have a new moon.

13:44.040 --> 13:50.380
Well, you can't do that, you know, because it takes two weeks to get from one state to the other.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.460
Right, yes, I agree entirely.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.220
In the Harold Shea stories, as in most or many of the other novels you've written,

14:00.280 --> 14:07.280
at least in the science fantasy area, my observation is that your humor comes from the unexpected things

14:07.280 --> 14:11.440
that happen when you put, say, a modern man back into a world of legend or myth.

14:11.640 --> 14:21.580
One of the basic elements of humor in my estimation is the element of surprise or incongruity.

14:21.580 --> 14:32.180
In other words, a derby hat on a London businessman is not funny because they all wear them.

14:32.820 --> 14:37.960
But a derby hat on Trudy, a seizure is, you see, because it's incongruous.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.960
And that is a very considerable factor in humor.

14:43.020 --> 14:47.520
Right, and to make that incongruity, I guess, obvious or effective,

14:47.520 --> 14:51.940
you had to construct, I guess, very realistic or very accurate kinds of background.

14:52.220 --> 15:00.800
Say, if it happened in the ancient world or a mythological world, you had to develop a highly realistic context for it.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.520
That's right.

15:01.940 --> 15:08.300
Where did your knowledge, your background in ancient history and mythology and so forth come from?

15:08.360 --> 15:10.180
Did you have to research those things heavily or?

15:10.740 --> 15:13.660
Actually, I've always been a very heavy reader.

15:13.660 --> 15:19.820
I was reading Darwin's origin of species through at the age of seven, you know, and things like that.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.580
And I had a pretty good historical and mythological knowledge.

15:25.340 --> 15:29.540
But actually, for the roaring trumpet fletcher, knew a good deal more about that than I,

15:29.600 --> 15:35.060
because he was an enthusiast for the northern thing, as William Morris called it.

15:35.060 --> 15:42.400
And it belonged to a group that got together in Boston and read Icelandic sagas to each other in the original.

15:44.520 --> 15:49.840
Well, therefore, he was way ahead of me in the matter of Norse mythology.

15:49.900 --> 15:54.620
Then the second story was played in the world of Spencer's fairy queen.

15:55.020 --> 16:00.240
And I had never read the fairy queen, so I sat down and utically plowed right through it.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.420
I never did have quite the enthusiasm for it.

16:03.420 --> 16:09.860
That fletcher did. I found it pretty tedious for long stretches, but nevertheless, he thought highly of it.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.000
And he went through it. And then for the third one, why we...

16:14.000 --> 16:22.500
I knew something about Ariostos Orlando Furioso, although I'd never read it through,

16:22.560 --> 16:25.360
but it wasn't very difficult to get hold of a set and read it.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.840
And that finished the material layer.

16:28.840 --> 16:39.220
Well, then after the Second World War, we sent Harold to the world of the Finnish Kalevala.

16:39.980 --> 16:45.600
And that was simply a matter of getting the Everyman's Library edition and reading through that and taking notes.

16:46.520 --> 16:54.680
And we finally had him end up where he'd wanted to go all along, which is in the mythological Ireland of Cuffolan and Queen Maeve.

16:55.160 --> 17:01.760
And I already knew a fair amount about that, but I read up some more. So we got the stories.

17:03.060 --> 17:07.860
What about some of your more historical places, like the Rome of Less Darkness Fall?

17:08.040 --> 17:12.460
Did you attempt to make that a picture of how 6th century Rome might have been?

17:12.800 --> 17:19.820
Yes, I did. I read everything I could get my hands on it from all the way from the original sources, such as Procopius.

17:21.760 --> 17:30.680
And the letters of what's his name? The Cassiodorus, which are available.

17:31.880 --> 17:47.540
And the various modern works on the final period of the fall of the Rome of the West Roman Empire and the barbarian era that followed.

17:48.880 --> 18:01.320
The reason I asked that is one time I read a critic or commentator on that book and he'd assumed or made the statement that he thought it might have been an alternate universe, but I thought that was incorrect that you'd attempted to do.

18:01.320 --> 18:14.120
No, it was not intended to be, although I'll have to confess to one minor error. After the book came out, I got a letter from a professor at Dalby at Columbia University with my new slide.

18:14.120 --> 18:23.480
He was saying that he'd read the book and enjoyed it greatly, but did I realize it on page such and such where I had a couple of my characters speaking Gothic?

18:24.400 --> 18:29.860
I realized that I had one of them use the nominative case where he should have used the vocative.

18:31.140 --> 18:32.520
Did you go back and change it?

18:34.040 --> 18:39.120
I don't remember. I think I did, but I'm not sure. It was just a matter of dropping an S off the end.

18:40.880 --> 18:59.180
I have another question on that book. It's not often I get a chance to ask an author about his intentions or his purposes. Maybe it's not a fair question, but some people have said, I've read this, that you had a serious theme to that work that one, you know, one, can one man change the past for the better?

18:59.920 --> 19:06.340
And I'm not sure if that was intended or if that's even a fair question, but did you have that kind of a theme behind it?

19:06.340 --> 19:13.160
I mean, I took that as my assumption as to whether it's so or not. I don't know. I don't think anyone else knows either.

19:14.380 --> 19:24.200
Because there's such a large factor of luck in all these historical developments, you know, as Napoleon had fallen off his horse and broken his neck early in his career.

19:24.200 --> 19:38.380
What would have happened? History is full of things like that where what looks like is going to be an amazing career, is cut short by some adventitious circumstance.

19:38.380 --> 19:49.440
However, my primary purpose in writing fiction has always been to entertain. And everything else takes a secondary place now.

19:49.720 --> 20:06.100
I don't say that a little preaching propaganda for causes that I personally admire like wildlife conservation, let's say, or my personal opinions and prejudices don't sneak in now and then.

20:06.100 --> 20:18.820
But nevertheless, the main purpose is entertainment. Some people say have said that, oh, well, such and such a story by DeKamp is a satire, a satirical.

20:19.080 --> 20:34.380
Well, I don't consider myself a satirist. In other words, I don't write for the intention with the intention of holding up some human institution or form of action

20:34.380 --> 20:56.360
to ridicule in the serious hope of getting people to change it. But on the other hand, the human scene around me is so full of dramatic and absurd and comical features that it's only natural to use them and put them in my stories.

20:58.000 --> 21:08.340
You have beautifully anticipated my next question, which was going to be that I did see a strain of gentle satire in your work and I was going to ask you to comment what you have.

21:09.780 --> 21:27.220
Well, as I say, you don't, if you really look around you over a good many years, you see so many funny things that you don't have to exercise great ingenuity or imagination in order to get an entertaining story out of it.

21:29.360 --> 21:48.620
Just to add a little bit to that, though, one of your later books, The Great Fetish, which the copy I have was published in 1978, my personal response to that was that there was more of a bite and more of a purpose to the satire, it seemed to me, in that book, particularly on, say, evolution and religion and so forth.

21:48.620 --> 21:58.620
Yes, well, you see, I'm the fellow who wrote the definitive history of the Scopes Evolution Trial, date in Tennessee in 1925.

21:59.520 --> 22:10.700
The book is called The Great Monkey Trial, and it just went out of print a double day, oh, years so ago, after having been in print for, oh, let's say, a dozen or fifteen years.

22:11.480 --> 22:17.420
And it was a book that got quite a lot of attention when it came out, most of it, happy to say favorable.

22:19.040 --> 22:28.120
And it seemed to me, really, I also did an article for the Scientific American a few years ago on the Eprison case.

22:28.120 --> 22:43.340
The article was called The End of the Monkey War, and it's about how the anti-evolution law of the state of Arkansas was appealed up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the court declared it unconstitutional.

22:44.220 --> 22:49.900
I'd followed that case rather closely and got to know the principles, such as the Eprison and such.

22:50.780 --> 23:01.620
And having been in, and my wife and I have also written a juvenile biography of Charles Darwin, Darwin and his great discovery published by McDonald, I think that's a great print.

23:02.540 --> 23:15.900
But having put so much time in on it, it just seemed to me that with the setup of this particular story, well, you know, the chance for a switch there, how about it,

23:15.900 --> 23:25.780
if the equivalent of our creationists today were the ones who were right for the reasons set forth in the story.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.720
So I took that as my assumption and worked it out from there.

23:32.560 --> 23:37.080
Okay, that's very good. Yeah, when the book started with the trial and I immediately thought of the Scopes trial.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.800
Yeah, exactly. Well, it's a switch on the Scopes trial, essentially.

23:44.220 --> 23:49.700
Okay, I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce this right, but the Gavagan's Bar, is that how it's...

23:49.700 --> 23:49.820
That's correct.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.520
Okay, of course that was another collaboration with Pratt, the story of tales from Gavagan's Bar.

23:55.620 --> 24:02.300
I was curious about the antecedents for that kind of a frame tale, you know, with the bar and the recurring characters and so forth.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.680
Was that something you came up with yourself or was there an antecedent for that?

24:05.680 --> 24:12.940
It did have an antecedent and that was the Jorkin stories of Lord Dunseney, which he wrote five volumes.

24:14.340 --> 24:18.340
And they include some very fine little stories indeed.

24:19.660 --> 24:31.300
I was familiar with the stories. I don't remember whether either Fletcher or I was consciously influenced by their example when we started our Gavagan's Bar series.

24:33.040 --> 24:39.140
Fletcher just said, well, let's write some short stories of this and that story laid in the bar, you know, Bar Room Tall Tales.

24:40.400 --> 24:45.560
And he also would write Dunseney and I daresay he had Jorkin's back up his mind too.

24:46.020 --> 24:56.900
By a coincidence, our friend Arthur C. Clarke over in England was just beginning his Tales of the Fight Hard at the same time, which is also a set of Bar Room Tall Tales.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.660
Neither of us knew about what the other was doing.

25:01.820 --> 25:08.660
Okay, yeah. I thought your book, Antidated, was before the Tales of the White Heart?

25:09.180 --> 25:29.020
I don't know offhand what the date of publication of Tales of the White Heart was, but in any case, I do believe it's correct that both Art and Frat and I were working on these series at the same time.

25:29.020 --> 25:37.220
At least they overlapped. After all, we wrote these stories over a period of several years before they were collected in book form.

25:37.780 --> 25:42.580
They appeared in various magazines, including the Old Weird Tales even.

25:44.240 --> 25:44.500
Hmm.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.900
In the last years, it's folded in 1954.

25:52.260 --> 26:00.060
Would you say that there is anything that would not work as humor in science fiction or science fantasy?

26:00.180 --> 26:03.480
For instance, I have in mind, I'd say, heroic fantasy of the Conan type.

26:04.480 --> 26:11.780
Would it be possible to retain the heroic grandness, the environment of that kind of story and still write it humorously?

26:13.340 --> 26:25.260
Hmm. Well, you couldn't get the same effect that Robert Howard did with his Conan, because in Robert Howard's original Conan stories, there is hardly any humor.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.360
Only in a couple of stories is there a faint gleam of it here and there.

26:32.640 --> 26:47.880
And when I collaborate with President Day-Colon's stories with, let us say, Carter, why he has to calm me down now and then, because I just have a natural tendency to stick a little humor in now and then.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.360
I've been doing it so long.

26:50.260 --> 26:54.580
Natural, but it should not be done because it spoils the general effect.

26:54.580 --> 27:06.240
Now, as for my own stories in that genre, well, I have no hesitation about putting in humor in and putting humor in, and my heroes are in general not Superman.

27:07.180 --> 27:11.020
They have to be pretty able fellows, but I try to make them realistic.

27:11.120 --> 27:16.220
That is with the usual assortment of virtues and vices and strengths and weaknesses.

27:17.620 --> 27:22.160
So that's the kind of character that I personally find it easier to believe in when I read it.

27:24.700 --> 27:35.340
When you write a science fiction story that you intend to be humorous, do you write it as a humorous science fiction story or as a humorous story that is science fiction?

27:37.320 --> 27:40.120
Well, I think that's mainly a matter of definition.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.240
I never really thought of it.

27:42.240 --> 27:49.880
I have not been successful in writing non-imaginative humor.

27:50.060 --> 27:54.320
In other words, writing stories in a realistic setting and primarily humorous.

27:54.740 --> 28:05.300
I did take a crack at one once, back around 1948, I guess it was, just shortly after the Hitlerian War.

28:06.380 --> 28:19.440
And I wrote a whole novel that was sort of intended to be in the general vein of P.G. Woodhouse and Thorne Smith, whom I was quite an admirer.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.780
But unfortunately, when it was finished, everybody who saw it shuddered.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.100
They said it stank and I'm afraid they were right.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.980
Well, it's never been published from that day to this.

28:30.980 --> 28:34.760
And it probably would be better for my reputation if it ever is.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.020
What's been your most popular work in terms of sales?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.420
Do you have any estimation of that?

28:41.620 --> 28:44.320
Oh, goodness, that's hard to say.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.440
And it also depends upon which kind of writing you're talking about.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.600
In fiction, I suppose probably one or the other of the Conan stories.

28:58.600 --> 29:09.520
But then since most of those I've written in collaboration, those that I have written, why I suppose half the credit ought to go to the collaborator.

29:10.920 --> 29:18.340
In nonfiction, I think the most sales are those of the ancient engineers.

29:20.680 --> 29:24.060
Okay, I only had one more question on humor.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.160
I'd like to ask you a little bit about Conan afterwards.

29:26.440 --> 29:26.640
Sure.

29:27.780 --> 29:37.440
Is there anything special or unique about science fiction or science fantasy that makes it a unique feel for a humorist?

29:37.880 --> 29:40.800
I mean, anything that you couldn't do in other forms of fiction?

29:41.900 --> 29:58.500
Well, you can, of course, because of the fact that you're much less limited as to your settings and your basic assumptions than you are in realistic fiction.

29:58.500 --> 30:13.520
It gives you unlimited opportunities for working the essential factors of humor, such as surprise and incongruity.

30:16.900 --> 30:20.940
So I'd say on the whole that it's a very good field for humor.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.700
But in a way that certain other fields are not.

30:26.180 --> 30:42.480
For example, I don't get a laugh out of funny war stories, for example, because to me war is a pretty serious business and not a proper subject for levity.

30:45.400 --> 30:54.900
Okay, to switch direction for just a minute here, your background, as I've read, is engineering, say your college background, sort of a practical science background.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.240
And you've written books on inventions and so forth.

30:58.580 --> 31:01.220
Of course, that's led to many nonfiction books too, as you pointed out.

31:02.020 --> 31:06.560
Does that kind of background influence your science fiction?

31:06.560 --> 31:27.480
Yes, it does. If you read any of my stories laid in an imaginary milieu, you will notice a good deal more attention paid to the nuts and bolts element of the background, the various gadgets that people use and how they work.

31:28.720 --> 31:36.080
You'll notice a good deal more of that than you will in a similar story by one of my contemporaries.

31:36.080 --> 31:59.320
As for example, the last Christian novel that I had published, The Hostage's Deer, at one point where the protagonist, Fergus Reed, is looking for a means to escape.

32:00.500 --> 32:10.320
Incidentally, he is one who gets married to a beautiful extraterrestrial princess and wishes like hell he could get out of it somehow.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.640
Well, she's a great board, is only interested in one thing.

32:17.640 --> 32:26.740
And so while he is down on the waterfront with his bodyguard to see that he doesn't bolt, the fire breaks out.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.480
And presently, a crew of firemen come running up with a fire engine.

32:33.560 --> 32:38.300
Now, the fire engine, however, is the type that was actually used in the ancient world.

32:38.980 --> 32:47.800
And I got that, so I get that through my readings in the history of science and technology, which, to say, is just a big tub with handles at the corners and a pump in the middle.

32:49.360 --> 33:01.960
And the firemen carry it by the handles, they set it down in front of where the fire is, they organize a bucket brigade to fill the tank, and then they heave up and down on the pump handles to squirt water at the fire.

33:02.620 --> 33:09.200
And that is what you might call the predecessor of the modern steam-powered fire engine.

33:11.340 --> 33:22.160
Okay, so some of those books where you write about the inventions, say inventions in their management or inventions patents and so forth, the heroic age of American invention, are those still in print?

33:23.120 --> 33:28.120
Well, now let me think. I believe that invention patents and their management is in print.

33:28.320 --> 33:37.320
In fact, I rather dread the day that let them industries will call me up and say, hey, DeCamb, you've got to rewrite the chapter on copyright, the light of the new copyright law.

33:39.880 --> 33:45.180
The heroic age of American invention, no, that's been out of print for quite a good long while.

33:46.300 --> 33:52.450
Ancient engineers is available from Valentine in paperback.

33:55.360 --> 34:05.860
Natalie, two of my books, Ancient Engineers and Great Cities of the Ancient World, sold much better in Germany than they did in this country.

34:06.800 --> 34:14.780
Great Cities didn't make much of a splash in America, but in Germany it made the best teller list.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.560
What's your reputation in Europe, Natalie, that you brought that up? Are you sell pretty well over there overall in Europe?

34:23.580 --> 34:34.280
Yes, pretty well. Mainly in the United Kingdom and Germany. Also, quite a lot of stuff has come out in Italy.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.120
Those will be translations, correct?

34:37.380 --> 34:37.540
Yes.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.080
I've had a few translations in Japan, even.

34:49.080 --> 34:59.360
Maybe this isn't a fair question to ask of an author, but is it a question of enjoyment or the mood you're in as to whether you write, say, a science fiction or a fantasy book or a nonfiction one?

34:59.580 --> 35:03.740
Is there an enjoyment involved with one over the other, or is it a duty that you feel?

35:03.740 --> 35:10.820
Well, let's say that when I have finished one big job, I like to tackle another one in a different field, just for a change.

35:11.460 --> 35:17.280
In other words, when I have written the novel, well, next time around maybe I'll try an article or a nonfiction book.

35:18.140 --> 35:20.980
When I finish a nonfiction book, I want to get back to fiction.

35:22.060 --> 35:32.400
Right now, for example, I am completing my own autobiography, and my wife is doing the final draft of the Biography of Robert Howard.

35:35.340 --> 35:42.720
And I have a couple of novels, one science fiction and one fantasy in mind, which I want to get to as well as several short stories.

35:45.180 --> 35:51.200
Okay, on the Conan material, I guess heroic fantasy or whatever, or sword and sorcery, whatever the genre.

35:52.060 --> 35:56.080
Now, you had written heroic fantasy that type before you took up with Conan, right?

35:56.420 --> 35:57.080
That is right.

35:57.080 --> 36:01.980
In fact, I was writing it before the term was invented and before I'd even heard of Robert Howard.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.020
How did you get involved with his material?

36:06.040 --> 36:07.200
In with Howard's material?

36:07.300 --> 36:07.540
Right.

36:09.180 --> 36:13.200
I went up to New York and it was around the end of 1950.

36:14.780 --> 36:21.280
And, let me see, I think it was the naval war game at the press department or something.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.100
No, it wasn't.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.720
It was part of his press department.

36:24.740 --> 36:31.880
And he handed me a copy of Conan the Conqueror, found in hardback, published by Noam Press.

36:33.060 --> 36:39.520
And he said, here, take this for long. I think you might find it interesting. I don't care much for it myself, but no.

36:40.220 --> 36:47.240
So I took it. It seems that Martin had, my inadvertence, sent Fletcher to review copies.

36:47.740 --> 36:48.740
Fletcher gave me one.

36:49.260 --> 36:52.920
So I started reading it on the train going home and was hooked right away.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.480
Kept on until I'd read the thing through and then I read it through again.

36:58.800 --> 37:07.080
And then I got hold of John Clark, who had, whom I had heard, casually mentioned Conan once or twice,

37:07.100 --> 37:10.420
but he never tried to tell me on the idea and I said, hey, what is this?

37:10.420 --> 37:15.720
And John said, told me about it.

37:15.900 --> 37:23.760
He had a bound file of tear sheets of the original Conan stories in Weird Tales, which he lent to me.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.900
And I devoured them.

37:26.700 --> 37:40.060
Then a year later, when I found some, learned about some unpublished Conan manuscripts in the custody of the agent for the Howard Literary Estate.

37:41.500 --> 37:51.960
And I read them and arrangements were made with the Howard Ayers and the agent for me to edit them for public and arrange for publication.

37:52.480 --> 37:58.880
And then on things have gone on and on and build up from that.

38:00.320 --> 38:05.400
As far as you know, is there any more of the Howard material which has not been published relating to Conan,

38:05.920 --> 38:10.400
that, you know, papers or story ideas and so forth that have not been...

38:10.400 --> 38:15.820
I don't know, but the person who asked about that is not me, but Glenn Lord in Pasadena, Texas.

38:16.740 --> 38:21.700
Do you envision yourself writing any more Conan material, you know, the original Conan material?

38:24.980 --> 38:28.000
I won't make any promises or predictions.

38:28.460 --> 38:32.700
Right now, let's say I do not have anything like that in mind.

38:33.540 --> 38:38.620
I am involved in the novelization of the Conan the Barbarian movie.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.340
But when that is out of the way, why?

38:43.300 --> 38:46.940
There are no present plans for anything more.

38:47.720 --> 38:52.720
Not that I expect to be idle. I have enough to do to be busy for a whole other lifetime.

38:54.020 --> 38:59.100
I was going to ask you about the movie, your involvement with that. Are you hired as a consultant or a screenwriter?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.280
It's supposed to be a technical advisor.

39:03.320 --> 39:08.740
Do you have any information on when it's going to be out or if it's going to be true to the books?

39:09.100 --> 39:13.580
They are at present shooting in Spain. They expect to finish in May.

39:15.100 --> 39:21.080
And the movie should be released about 13 or 14 months from now.

39:23.880 --> 39:28.560
At least that's the last I've heard, but there are always slippage in these things, you know.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.100
You've written this kind of material for so long.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.960
Probably your perspective is better than anybody else's on this.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.420
Doesn't it seem that heroic fantasy or sword and sorcery is extremely popular now?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.140
A huge reading public.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.680
Have you wondered about that?

39:47.780 --> 39:51.660
Or wondered if it's going to wear off? Is it a fad or the reasons for it?

39:51.660 --> 39:57.540
These things always tend to go in waves and they go up and down and may build up further.

39:57.540 --> 40:03.120
Eventually there's bound to be a dip in public interest, so that doesn't mean that it'll just disappear.

40:03.500 --> 40:08.880
It'll decline little and then maybe rise up again in another 20 or 50 years.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.260
You can't really predict.

40:12.940 --> 40:25.520
I think that part of the popularity of the genre was a reaction to certain trends in fiction following the Second World War,

40:25.520 --> 40:40.420
such as the fondness for heavily subjective psychological or psychiatric stories, very sentimental stories,

40:40.600 --> 40:50.260
stories glorifying the little man, the anti-hero, you know, that hopeless little jerk who can't do anything right

40:50.260 --> 40:55.760
and who has no brains or brawn or character and whose only function is to suffer and suffer.

40:56.520 --> 41:00.020
Well, I think people got sort of tired of that after a while.

41:00.300 --> 41:10.020
So then between the paperback publication of the Conan stories, for which I can claim the credit, I'm the one who sold them,

41:10.020 --> 41:20.040
and the paperback publication of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, which was the other major factor in launching this boom,

41:20.700 --> 41:28.700
why that got people to reading heroic fantasy on a large scale, which they are still doing.

41:30.940 --> 41:35.140
Okay, you mentioned earlier the biography of Robert E. Howard.

41:35.560 --> 41:35.980
Yes.

41:37.260 --> 41:41.140
I read somewhere where the title of that was going to be Dark Valley Destiny. Is that correct?

41:41.840 --> 41:43.400
When is that scheduled for release?

41:44.300 --> 41:48.420
We haven't finished the work on it yet, and we don't have a contract.

41:49.940 --> 41:58.600
We're one of these months. We shall turn the thing over to our agent and they go to it, Alan, and see what's the best deal you can get.

41:58.600 --> 42:08.200
But a great deal depends on who owns what in all the Conan literary properties at that time,

42:08.420 --> 42:15.460
and that becomes a matter of finance and litigation and things of that sort.

42:16.400 --> 42:22.220
I would assume that you are probably as knowledgeable on Howard as anybody living.

42:22.660 --> 42:27.860
In your research and your study of the man, what kind of person did you find him to be?

42:29.280 --> 42:37.340
Well, let's say that I'd like to have met him, which I physically could have in the early 1930s if I had known about him,

42:37.340 --> 42:39.020
but I'd never heard of him at that time.

42:40.940 --> 42:46.440
But he and I had a good many interests in common in history, mythology, and so on.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.620
And we might have gotten along fine.

42:51.240 --> 42:55.820
If I'd want to see him in cross planes, maybe I have sometimes fantasized.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.280
He could have taught me to box while I taught him defense.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.200
I was on my college team, you see, fencing.

43:01.860 --> 43:04.040
It wasn't very good, but then you were the others.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.600
So on the other hand, it's very possible that we couldn't have stood each other,

43:10.600 --> 43:15.860
because you can't tell how the chemical combination of two personalities is going to work out.

43:16.760 --> 43:22.040
And Robert was a person who, one of his outstanding personality quirks,

43:22.200 --> 43:28.760
was a tendency to form dislikes and bitter hatred on little or no pretext.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.840
He hated all sorts of people.

43:32.900 --> 43:43.440
He was a, well, let's say that Conan is an obvious idealization of, just a minute.
