00:01.000 --> 00:02.580
How is my trip out here?

00:04.760 --> 00:07.380
As usual, hectic and hastily planned.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.120
We always seem to, even though we have the best intentions of getting everything together

00:14.960 --> 00:22.760
well in advance and very organized and business-like, we tend not to.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.800
But if I ask a dumb question or something like that, just say,

00:28.060 --> 00:30.880
wait a minute, you know, back up, we chop all that stuff out.

00:30.920 --> 00:31.700
Yeah, it's no problem.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.740
Or if I make a dumb answer.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.340
We chop that out too.

00:37.400 --> 00:37.800
Okay.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.080
Let's start off with the basic one.

00:44.140 --> 00:47.200
When did you get interested or when did you get interested in art development?

00:48.020 --> 00:49.600
I think I developed when I was born.

00:51.200 --> 00:57.360
My father's always worked in the space industry, or in the missiles and space industry.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.540
So I had that input around me.

00:59.620 --> 01:04.720
He had always been reading science fiction since I was young.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.480
So I had the magazines around to look at.

01:06.700 --> 01:14.860
And some of my earliest recollections are of looking at the covers of old amazing stories, magazines, or paperback books.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.480
And in fact, some of them influenced me to a great deal.

01:17.480 --> 01:22.760
Before I could even read or write, I remember looking at some of those covers for hours

01:22.760 --> 01:26.560
and absorbing the visual feeling of the paintings.

01:27.600 --> 01:34.300
There were a few that were especially captivating for me.

01:34.820 --> 01:38.320
And I remembered them to this day exactly what the paintings look like.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.520
And I could describe to you the compositions and some of the colors of the paintings.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.780
And it's a funny thing at the last World Science Fiction Convention, I was walking down

01:47.840 --> 01:50.720
by one of the dealer's tables in the dealer's room.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.000
And I just started going through some of the paperback books.

01:54.060 --> 01:57.440
And I saw one of the covers that I remembered from when I was three years old or whatever.

01:58.700 --> 02:04.520
It was interesting to me because I hadn't been able, in retrospect, to pinpoint the exact time

02:04.520 --> 02:07.980
when I started really being fascinated by science fiction imagery.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.600
And this book had been published in 1952 or 53.

02:11.600 --> 02:17.540
So being born in 1950, that pretty much establishes the beginning of that at around three years old or so.

02:17.820 --> 02:26.360
But the fact that it meant so much to me that I remembered that exact cover until my present age

02:26.360 --> 02:32.160
says something about how I guess it was just a part of me that that kind of imagery was important to me.

02:32.980 --> 02:38.920
But later when I began to read, I became an avid reader of all types of literature,

02:38.920 --> 02:40.580
but especially science fiction and fantasy.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.260
And I had an interest in arts, so the two combined.

02:44.920 --> 02:49.460
And it seemed natural to me to read and try to draw what I read.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.780
And I would come home sometimes from science fiction movies or movies that I enjoyed

02:53.780 --> 02:56.920
and tried to illustrate scenes that I'd seen in the movie from memory.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.100
And that carried on pretty much into right into my college years.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.080
I can continue beyond that point.

03:08.900 --> 03:18.880
Because in college I had been laboring under the assumption that I had to have a real type of profession.

03:20.140 --> 03:26.040
This is largely due to input from my parents, but I felt that I had to be something professional, like a lawyer,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.500
something respectable, which being an artist isn't.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.960
So I was diverted during my college years into wanting to become a doctor,

03:37.240 --> 03:39.680
which is still a major interest in mine and had me a physiology.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.680
And the sciences in general were always important to me.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.700
But about three quarters of the way through my college education,

03:46.880 --> 03:51.380
I decided to abandon my pre-med training and go full scale.

03:51.780 --> 03:57.680
Well, actually it wasn't until my last year of college that I decided full tilt to go into illustrating or painting.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.380
And I graduated with a degree in painting.

04:00.280 --> 04:06.800
If I had taken one more course I would have had a degree in biology with an emphasis on anatomy and physiology, human anatomy and physiology.

04:07.960 --> 04:13.020
To go a little bit on that, does that background or how does that background help you when you're painting?

04:13.260 --> 04:15.760
Well, it helps me a lot in several ways.

04:15.820 --> 04:22.580
First of all in constructing alien forms by just extrapolating upon comparative biology.

04:22.580 --> 04:34.260
I can develop a life form that's both interesting visually and somewhat convincingly suited for a particular environment on another planet.

04:34.900 --> 04:40.060
There's that and also it helps me in constructing a human form because I did a lot of dissection

04:40.820 --> 04:43.740
and I know my human anatomy fairly well.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.200
Whereas I know a lot of artists who don't, they know surface anatomy,

04:48.200 --> 04:54.440
but they can't really construct a person well out of their imagination without at least the extensive use of photographs.

04:54.780 --> 04:55.940
And that's something I try to avoid.

04:56.900 --> 05:02.500
I think it shows in an artist's painting when one uses a photograph to develop the person

05:02.500 --> 05:04.960
and then tries to create the rest of the painting out of one's imagination.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.840
You see a real dichotomy between the way the person is painted and the rest of the painting is painted.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.600
If it all comes out of your mind and it all looks like one product or whatever.

05:15.820 --> 05:23.620
But one of the jobs I had when I was putting myself through colleges working in the anatomy and physiology labs

05:23.620 --> 05:26.840
at the university I went to preparing the cadavers for the classes.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.200
And during that time I managed to get some work in doing medical illustrations.

05:31.460 --> 05:37.600
All this combined to really give me a good fundamental education in the way the body is made up.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.780
You had some further training going on in art.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.440
Yes, after college I went to, I wasn't, the teachers told me I was ready for a professional career,

05:48.540 --> 05:50.880
but I didn't know what I wanted to do yet.

05:51.060 --> 05:57.760
I mean I still didn't, well I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't have the confidence to throw everything I had into a career in illustration.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.000
I didn't know really where to start.

05:59.140 --> 06:05.960
So to get a kind of professional polish I enrolled in the Art Center College of Design and LA.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.300
That's now in Pasadena.

06:10.720 --> 06:20.660
They moved after I left, but I only went there for nine months because I felt that they didn't have much to teach me after I was in there.

06:20.980 --> 06:25.200
And a couple of my teachers advised me just to drop out and go ahead and start working.

06:25.440 --> 06:31.680
So I sent some samples of my work to publishers in New York and a couple of them bit.

06:32.180 --> 06:38.120
So I threw everything I had into the back of my Volkswagen and drove out from California to the East Coast to find my fortune.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.440
That's where?

06:39.580 --> 06:40.300
Don Wilheim?

06:40.380 --> 06:47.560
Yes, Don Wilheim of Dollbooks was very interested in my work and quite supportive really in my early years.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.080
Just a bit of a story.

06:51.340 --> 06:56.380
What was, you got your first like cover job, how did that happen?

06:56.540 --> 06:57.220
What happened there?

06:57.580 --> 06:59.420
Well there was a couple of ways that it happened.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.320
Excuse me.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.920
I had a portfolio of items.

07:05.260 --> 07:09.980
I came out to the East Coast and sat down and for two weeks just painted straight through.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.220
I came out with seven pieces at the end of that time.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.060
Excuse me.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.880
Well that made me cut out all my coffin.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.340
Anyway I had a portfolio of pieces and I went around first to Marvel Comics.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.660
I'm starting low, at least in my opinion at this point.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.800
I showed it to Roy Thomas who was the editor in chief at that time and he bought three pieces out of the portfolio.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.540
So my first cover assignments weren't really commissioned from me.

07:39.620 --> 07:42.140
They were bought from me because they were already done.

07:43.300 --> 07:47.360
Now it's true that after you bought those you required extensive changes in the work.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.800
Something that still bothers me to this day.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.080
Anyway that's how that happened.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.300
Now with Don Wilheim he saw slides of my work of course from California.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.500
Later I went in to see him when I came out to the East Coast and he gave me a manuscript for a book.

08:02.700 --> 08:09.320
I took it home and did some sketches for the manuscript based upon ideas that I thought would make good cover ideas.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.560
He selected one and gave me the go ahead and that became the painting.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.780
That's pretty much how I work on every book cover.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.020
You're reading a manuscript now?

08:19.420 --> 08:19.880
Several.

08:20.420 --> 08:20.700
Several.

08:21.020 --> 08:21.160
Yeah.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.960
Why don't you go through how that process works for you?

08:26.980 --> 08:28.200
Pick a specific.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.880
Boy that's hard.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.940
Every book is so different.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.240
What about that one?

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
Oh the White Dragon, yeah.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.960
That's going back away.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.640
That's back in 77 or 78 when I did that.

08:42.500 --> 08:47.540
I read the book one time just as a reader so to speak.

08:47.660 --> 09:00.680
Then I go through it again the second time as an illustrator making notes and margins about details of way people and objects and things look.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.140
Making sure that I try to catch all the details.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.660
So I don't make someone who's blonde, black-haired or whatever.

09:08.940 --> 09:12.020
I like to be really true to the story as much as possible.

09:12.460 --> 09:15.060
Especially if I'm taking a narrative approach to doing an illustration.

09:17.620 --> 09:26.100
After going through it that second time I'll sit down and start to develop thumbnail sketches which are just small drawings on scrap paper actually.

09:26.860 --> 09:31.760
And try to formulate an idea of what I would like to illustrate from that book.

09:32.420 --> 09:37.580
There's usually something in any book no matter how bad or good that will make a good painting.

09:37.780 --> 09:43.440
It's a matter of digging through it and finding what interests you and what motivates you to do a really good job.

09:44.900 --> 09:51.640
So I go through it and try to collate all my different ideas and put it together into a painting.

09:51.880 --> 09:56.120
That is a mysterious part that I can't really describe to you how that happens.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.640
I guess that's what makes me what I am.

09:59.720 --> 10:05.140
That process there of distilling what I've read into something that's a visual image that captures what's in the book.

10:05.940 --> 10:09.740
That process takes a few days to do.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.740
Sometimes I get an instant image.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.100
The cover I just did for Robert A. Highline's book Friday.

10:17.980 --> 10:22.480
I had an instantaneous concept of what that cover was going to look like.

10:22.480 --> 10:28.640
As soon as I finished reading the book the first time I had a perfectly clear idea of what Friday looked like.

10:29.260 --> 10:37.800
I knew that the cover to this book had to be a portrait of this character because the character had such personality.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.220
Really the book was written around her personality I think.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.940
So that was my approach there.

10:45.060 --> 10:49.660
With other books like The White Dragon it involved a much more laborious process.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.180
There were so many good scenes to choose from.

10:52.800 --> 10:58.120
It's hard to figure out which one would be the best one for the book and which one is my favorite.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.520
That takes a little bit more time.

11:02.620 --> 11:08.560
Eventually I come to somewhere between one and eight images that I think I like.

11:08.980 --> 11:16.480
If I am terribly indecisive I'll send it to the publisher or to the art editor or whatever who makes that kind of decision in a particular company.

11:17.260 --> 11:23.020
He or she will choose the one that they like the most and make the decision for me.

11:23.980 --> 11:28.800
Then once I am given the ball I run with it and do the final painting, the major painting.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.400
That becomes the book cover.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.520
Do you get any feedback from the authors about the cover?

11:35.640 --> 11:36.580
Yes lots of times.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.260
In fact with Friday I got a phone call from Robert A. Highline.

11:41.220 --> 11:51.340
A couple months after I turned in the painting to Valentine Del Rey they sent him a cover proof which is a first run color tryout of what the cover is going to look like.

11:51.440 --> 11:56.240
He called me up to tell me it was a little flattery.

11:56.620 --> 12:03.840
He told me it was the best cover he ever had on a book of his which is really quite a statement for someone who has been in the field as long as he has.

12:04.960 --> 12:13.900
To have an author tell me that I have captured a particular character or scene exactly the way they had it in mind is probably for me the highest praise that an illustrator can get.

12:14.960 --> 12:21.660
That really had me floating up by the ceiling for a couple of weeks to think that he would bother to call me to tell me that.

12:22.740 --> 12:29.340
Sometimes before I do a painting I will correspond with an author or talk to him or her on the phone to establish certain details.

12:29.340 --> 12:37.120
With the White Dragon for example I talked to Anne McCaffrey at length about the actual details of the dragons.

12:37.600 --> 12:50.840
As she saw the dragons in her book whether they had forks or tails that ended in a point or whatever or a barb or whatever and what their skin was like and what the texture was so that I could try to capture her image of what they look like.

12:51.520 --> 13:01.860
It's kind of silly for someone who is an illustrator to try to make all that up when you can contact the author and get the details if they are not in the book straight from the person who thought them up.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.560
When you did Friday, weren't you working in a new medium here? Airbrush?

13:08.240 --> 13:18.540
Oh no, well no, I've been using the airbrush since 1975. The difference lately is that I'm using it a bit more than I was in the past.

13:18.540 --> 13:27.380
Now in Friday there is no airbrush work in the foreground in the figure. That's all done with washes to create that smooth skin tone.

13:27.700 --> 13:35.920
I deliberately went about doing that painting with the idea of giving a real photographic quality to what you're seeing so that you can reach out and touch her so to speak.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.800
Which is also a very important part of that character.

13:39.800 --> 13:51.020
The background though is composed of a lot of airbrush work and I usually keep my airbrush work to the background because I don't want it to dominate a painting.

13:51.220 --> 14:00.520
I hate to work in airbrush frankly because it's so tedious and I'm so clumsy that I often spill things on me and mix it up color in the little bottles and all that.

14:03.120 --> 14:11.380
The only airbrush I have is the crudest model made by the Pasha Airbrush Company and that forces me to keep it to the background pretty much.

14:12.660 --> 14:29.600
I like to use it sometimes as a sketching tool when the airbrush develops soft masses of color in certain areas that have no hard edges so you can paint in and out of those areas without creating a distracting, I don't know what the word would be, background noise.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.740
But distracting hard edges underneath what you're painting on top.

14:36.160 --> 14:43.240
I think it will be some time before I actually bring my airbrush work right up to the foreground and make a painting that's completely airbrush.

14:44.140 --> 14:47.580
My cover for Arthur C. Clark's book 2010 approaches that.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.680
There is a lot of airbrush work in the foreground there.

14:51.300 --> 14:55.140
But that was such a simple composition that it pretty much required that I think.

14:58.860 --> 15:03.000
What about using oils and acrylics?

15:03.380 --> 15:04.660
I know you prefer acrylics.

15:04.800 --> 15:09.500
Well I prefer acrylics for illustration because they dry so quickly.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.940
That's the only reason really.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.780
Well there's two reasons actually why I like to use acrylics.

15:15.460 --> 15:20.200
They dry so quickly and it's the main reason and that's the reason why I first started using them.

15:20.200 --> 15:26.680
My training had all been in oils and watercolors and a lot of my early illustrations were in those two media.

15:26.920 --> 15:34.540
But I found myself often working at 3 o'clock in the morning before the day or the morning of the day that I had to turn a painting in.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.900
I couldn't bring a painting in wet so I'd have to make so much drier in with the painting.

15:39.680 --> 15:46.100
There's a substance called cobalt drier that if you put too much in the paint it seriously affects the longevity of the painting.

15:46.100 --> 15:55.580
In fact I have a painting I did in late 74 that has now cracked up a lot in oil painting because I had to rush it dry that way.

15:57.040 --> 16:02.820
So my feeling is if I can't paint an oil painting right so that it will last and be a good investment to someone who may buy it

16:02.820 --> 16:09.540
then I'd rather not use that medium at all unless I have the time to be able to develop it in the correct process

16:09.540 --> 16:13.020
so that it'll last for posterity.

16:13.020 --> 16:17.200
So I use acrylics and it certainly is easier for me.

16:17.340 --> 16:22.760
I can paint right up to two minutes before the messenger comes to pick up my painting and take it to the publisher

16:23.440 --> 16:30.100
and put in that last little highlight or whatever and not have to worry about it being wet or being damaged en route.

16:30.780 --> 16:35.520
Some people say acrylics don't have the depth that oils have but I had to notice that.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.000
It all depends on how you use them.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.280
I see a lot of flat acrylic paintings frankly.

16:44.940 --> 16:54.800
I had to teach myself how to use them and I think my background in oils dictated that I try to duplicate some of the feeling that you get in oil paintings with acrylics

16:54.800 --> 17:03.340
and maybe because I approach it from that aspect I attempted to do that to get that feeling in depth with my acrylics

17:03.340 --> 17:09.520
and other people who have just had a training in acrylics only don't try to do that because they feel limited by that.

17:10.340 --> 17:13.240
The fast drying time is also a lot of ability with acrylics.

17:13.340 --> 17:18.440
It's very hard to blend large areas of color and that's why I often resort to the airbrush.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.740
I can do it with washes if I have to but it takes a lot longer.

17:22.580 --> 17:25.740
I did a painting for a book by Clifford Simac called City.

17:26.140 --> 17:31.240
There's a big blue sky in the background and it took me 32 washes of color

17:31.240 --> 17:35.920
to get just the right gradations of blues in the background.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.520
That took me about a day and a half or two days to do.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.980
With an airbrush I probably could have gotten exactly the same effect in a half an hour.

17:44.140 --> 17:48.500
When you're working a hundred hour week or an 80 hour week like I do,

17:49.440 --> 17:51.360
a half an hour can make a big difference in the painting.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.380
I don't work 80 or 100 hour weeks all the time but I often do.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.280
It seems like most of the last year I did.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.360
That half an hour or two days per the time makes a big difference.

18:06.660 --> 18:11.040
I resort to the airbrush just because it is a good time saving tool and I can duplicate the same effects.

18:15.360 --> 18:20.420
I like oil paints a lot and I want to get back into using them

18:20.420 --> 18:26.180
just because it has a whole historical romantic feeling to it.

18:26.180 --> 18:31.580
It's hard to describe to someone who is a non-artist but the smell of turpentine in a studio

18:32.120 --> 18:34.740
has a certain sense of nostalgia and romance to it.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.640
It is an entirely enjoyable experience to paint in oils.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.780
It's a whole different thing from working in acrylics.

18:43.020 --> 18:45.100
I would like to go back into painting with oils.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.260
I just have to give myself the time to do so.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.340
There is a problem I have with oils though which is the second reason why I use acrylics.

18:52.340 --> 18:58.000
I develop skin problems when I get turpentine in contact with my skin.

18:58.140 --> 18:59.300
I seem to be allergic to it.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.300
I sometimes have to use gloves or whatever when I am painting with oils.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.640
That makes it a less enjoyable experience.

19:06.780 --> 19:13.660
I like to have the feeling of holding the brush without the barrier of this rubber in between my hand and the brush.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.560
That may be a reason why I haven't gotten back into painting with oils.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.260
Let's see. What about the first time you were here?

19:27.560 --> 19:28.440
What was that about?

19:31.620 --> 19:37.580
I felt really good about it but a little ambivalent.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.680
I felt like it came a year too late because a year before I had done the White Dragon.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.380
I had done the entire John Carter of Mars series.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.600
I felt there was a pinnacle of my work at that time.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.940
That's when I felt I really deserved to get it.

19:54.320 --> 20:00.520
A year after that I still hadn't felt that I had bettered the work I had done the year before.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.900
I didn't feel...

20:04.500 --> 20:06.780
This often happens with Academy Awards for example.

20:06.780 --> 20:13.160
There will be three excellent movies that deserve to get the best picture.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.960
The award can only go to one.

20:15.620 --> 20:22.880
They will give it to one and give an award to the same director or something three years down the pike for a lesser effort.

20:23.880 --> 20:28.660
It's partially in acknowledgement of what the person did before that they didn't get the Oscar for.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.400
I felt that that was the situation the first time.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.380
I have gotten two or three more since then.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.240
It's easy for me to be blasé about it and say it's just an award.

20:42.980 --> 20:47.720
It's great but it doesn't pay the rent and it doesn't do a thing for my income or whatever.

20:49.060 --> 20:51.120
I'm not sure I would enjoy not getting one either.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.360
Other artists will ask me how does it feel when another hugo or whatever.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.440
I'll go, it's alright.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.120
It's nice.

21:04.140 --> 21:08.600
Again, it's easy for me to say that because I'm winning it.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.380
If I didn't win it, it would probably really bug me.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.200
I'm a competitive person, I have to admit.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.860
There are times when I'm sitting down and I think,

21:18.600 --> 21:21.780
wow, there's X number of thousand people that voted for me as the best artist.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.780
That's really something that there's that many people that enjoy my work that much.

21:24.780 --> 21:29.780
I actually put my name down as the best artist that they can think of.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.540
That's really something that gives me a boost sometimes.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.960
Here's a real hard question.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.820
I'm sure you're running to this.

21:42.960 --> 21:48.020
I have several friends who are fantasy and space art.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.580
They went on to get formal training in the arts.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.860
When they draw what was required in class,

21:55.040 --> 21:57.020
but when they went through what they wanted to draw,

21:57.820 --> 21:59.900
the instructor's gotten a little strange.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.060
Did you run into that?

22:01.380 --> 22:02.860
You run into it all the time.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.360
It's getting worse if not better.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.620
I mean, it's getting worse if it's not the same.

22:10.320 --> 22:20.260
There's only one school, an art school, I can think of that has opened up their attitudes towards that since 1972.

22:20.260 --> 22:26.120
There could very well be others, but I know the Paris School of Art in Connecticut

22:26.120 --> 22:29.360
has changed their attitudes a little bit as a result of Don Mates,

22:29.500 --> 22:34.960
who is one of their major graduates and who is a Hugo nominee now.

22:35.060 --> 22:40.340
They have a little bit more of a taller attitude towards science fiction or fantasy art.

22:42.480 --> 22:49.300
Unfortunately, you'll find a snobby attitude down towards fantasy and science fiction art.

22:49.760 --> 22:55.600
Among the public in general, it's just nearly impossible for anyone who does the type of work I do

22:56.500 --> 23:01.480
to get into galleries, to get any kind of critical recognition at all.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.080
It's only in the last few years that it's starting to show any hope.

23:06.700 --> 23:12.220
Unfortunately, the art schools, as usual, are years behind the real world.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.920
Even if they started showing fantasy and science fiction work in major museums and galleries,

23:18.780 --> 23:22.160
on a regular basis, it's going to be a long time until the art schools

23:22.160 --> 23:26.120
catch up and start showing a better attitude towards it.

23:26.260 --> 23:27.660
This is something I ran into.

23:28.220 --> 23:31.300
It's one of the reasons why I dropped out so quickly from Art Center.

23:32.180 --> 23:37.400
There's an instance where, there was a class I had, a figure drawing class,

23:37.640 --> 23:41.160
and the teacher was late and hadn't come in yet, and the model was just standing there.

23:42.380 --> 23:48.200
I had my drawing pad in front of me, and the model was dressed up in an 1890s type of getup,

23:48.380 --> 23:50.240
and he had a bicycle pump that was his prop.

23:51.940 --> 23:55.700
He was just standing there in this ridiculous pose that I had no interest in.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.540
I couldn't see any reason why I should have to draw that.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.280
I knew that I could draw it if I wanted to.

24:00.820 --> 24:06.180
I'd graduated already with a BA degree in painting at San Jose State University.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.220
I'm capable.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.220
I could draw that figure without having the figure in front of me.

24:10.220 --> 24:10.940
It was no problem.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.880
I just ignored him standing there and drew a picture of a giant, a big bald giant,

24:19.120 --> 24:22.040
standing on a mountain top, a very heroic type of pose.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.000
The teacher came in, looked over my shoulder and said,

24:24.460 --> 24:25.340
What is that?

24:26.000 --> 24:30.020
Then proceeded to scold me and give me all kinds of verbal abuse

24:30.020 --> 24:32.300
about refusing to draw what was in front of me.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.280
I just packed up my things and said, That's it.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.900
What am I here for?

24:37.060 --> 24:37.600
This is ridiculous.

24:37.600 --> 24:42.560
I'm not being taught anything by being forced to draw something

24:42.560 --> 24:45.820
that I have no interest in that I could learn nothing from.

24:47.380 --> 24:51.560
This you find in art schools all the time.

24:53.300 --> 24:58.400
There's also the situation where you have instructors who don't know

24:58.400 --> 25:02.700
how to teach, how to draw realistic art.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.740
One thing that I see all the time,

25:04.940 --> 25:06.820
I have art students corresponding with me.

25:06.820 --> 25:10.140
Art students who come to conventions to see me and talk to me.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.840
Where can I go to find out how to draw a person?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.920
Where can I go to find out how to render something the way it looks in real life?

25:18.420 --> 25:20.880
Because all they're getting are classes as an abstract painting,

25:21.420 --> 25:22.720
how to express your feelings.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.040
You can't express your feelings unless you have a vocabulary.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.220
If you've got to learn the vocabulary, the fundamentals first,

25:29.500 --> 25:33.560
if you decide to cast those aside, then fine.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.340
But first you've got to have a grounding in the academic training.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.660
After all, even Picasso did that.

25:40.140 --> 25:44.080
He was an incredible academy painter.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.400
He could render human figures with remarkable verity.

25:48.020 --> 25:51.880
First, but then he decided to go into more abstract expression.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.000
Fine, but you've got to have that grounding first.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.560
I don't think...

25:56.280 --> 25:57.840
Well, anyway, this is a pet peeve of mine.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.480
I see this happening time and time again where a school will graduate

26:02.480 --> 26:09.720
a number of students who are unable to make a living commercially as an artist,

26:10.080 --> 26:14.300
either doing portraits or commissions or in the commercial field

26:14.300 --> 26:19.280
because they're simply not skilled and don't have the mental makeup to be able to do it.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.180
So they end up being teachers.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.300
And what do they teach? The same thing that they paint.

26:22.760 --> 26:27.760
And so it's just a self-promoting system and it gets worse and worse and worse as the years go on.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.700
You get more and more incompetent people.

26:29.700 --> 26:34.820
And they graduate people who can't make a living out in the real world, quote, unquote,

26:34.940 --> 26:39.960
and they go back and teach as a way of living and they teach more incompetent people.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.440
And the poor students are the ones who are suffering because they go to a school,

26:43.520 --> 26:47.980
trust in a school to teach them what they need to know to be able to paint properly

26:47.980 --> 26:49.860
or express what they want to express.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.000
And they're not getting the education.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.680
I had a strong feeling that you were going to be able to do this.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.480
Yes, I had been.

26:58.840 --> 27:04.040
I waited two and a half years at San Jose State University

27:04.040 --> 27:07.680
until I finally started getting classes from what I considered to be decent instructors.

27:08.240 --> 27:13.480
I don't know why schools don't require their art teachers to have portfolios

27:13.960 --> 27:16.940
available for viewing by students before they sign up for their class.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.540
You can tell by looking at a teacher's portfolio what the teacher's attitude is.

27:21.060 --> 27:23.280
In fact, even if there's a little resume, that would help too.

27:23.280 --> 27:29.100
What the teacher's attitude is towards art, what the teacher's viewpoints are, et cetera.

27:29.200 --> 27:35.840
Then you could pick an instructor who has a possibility of teaching you what you want to learn.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.920
But it's ridiculous if you want to be a nature painter, for example,

27:39.040 --> 27:42.640
and paint natural animals in whatever, in a realistic manner,

27:42.780 --> 27:47.580
take a class from someone who teaches abstract expressionism.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.240
It's useless. It's a waste of money. It's a waste of time.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.000
Absolutely pointless.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.000
Good art is... Well, I can get into my whole spiel about abstract art anyway.

27:58.480 --> 28:03.680
There's no such thing as abstract... I mean, good art that is not good abstract art to begin with.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.920
That's the whole point by Whistler's mother. It's an abstract painting.

28:08.240 --> 28:15.920
The actual name or title of that painting is an arrangement in blacks and grays, I believe,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.460
is the actual title of the painting.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.500
Every good painting is a good abstract painting.

28:25.020 --> 28:30.880
It's just that someone who works realistically or works in a way that gives you a feeling that he's painting reality

28:31.620 --> 28:33.720
is taking it one step beyond the abstract,

28:33.980 --> 28:36.940
whereas an abstract painter will leave it at that point and not carry it any further.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.920
Sure. I'm sorry. I'm getting...

28:43.920 --> 28:46.600
I'm going to climb off my soapbox here for a second.

28:50.700 --> 28:55.580
What... Aside from fantasy, in general, what are your favorite subjects?

28:56.320 --> 28:59.720
Favorite type of subject? If you're not painting a cover, why paint?

29:00.240 --> 29:04.920
I think one thing that you can say about my work is that I try to cover all the fields.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.620
And that's because it's all... I don't have any particular favorite.

29:09.620 --> 29:12.940
I think I could say I have a favorite assignment each year.

29:13.180 --> 29:17.600
There's one assignment I get every year that is the one I look forward to.

29:17.820 --> 29:21.680
It's a regular thing now with doll books, and that's your best horror stories cover.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.980
It's a collection of horror stories, supposedly the year's best.

29:27.220 --> 29:32.360
And I have completely free reign. I often do with book covers, but especially with this one.

29:35.340 --> 29:39.560
And that's enjoyable to me. I like doing a good horror painting once in a while.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.020
I'm not a person who's interested in all the blood and guts.

29:42.200 --> 29:46.920
That's not necessarily what I... I equate that more with revulsion than I do with horror.

29:47.060 --> 29:53.760
There's a difference, but that is a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed doing that cover every year.

29:54.380 --> 29:55.640
That painting, I should say.

29:56.300 --> 30:00.140
I've come up with a few pretty scary ideas that never let me paint, too.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.840
Some day that I'll do just for myself, but that's only one aspect.

30:04.020 --> 30:08.020
I like, of course, the other aspects of science fiction and fantasy also.

30:08.200 --> 30:14.640
I like to paint... I like the exploration of space, what they call hardware paintings with spaceships and all that.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.120
That's a lot of fun. I like to just kind of keep my fingers in all of it.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.960
So I can't really say I have a... especially having a favorite field.

30:23.800 --> 30:28.480
Horror is one of them, and that particular job is probably my favorite assignment out of the year.

30:28.480 --> 30:36.360
But I can't say it's doing horror. It's something I like to do over doing other things, per se.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.020
Question from one of the other guys.

30:47.300 --> 30:54.040
How much does a cover affect the salability or popularity of a book? Do you get any feedback on that?

30:56.680 --> 30:57.560
Well, it...

30:57.560 --> 30:58.620
A cover of a solo book?

30:58.900 --> 31:02.280
I honestly don't know. I really don't know.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.120
Sometimes I think it makes a big difference, other times I don't.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.580
The fact that my career has gone where it has, and that...

31:13.880 --> 31:15.680
Sometimes I think it makes a big difference.

31:16.040 --> 31:20.940
The fact that I'm getting paid what I do and everything to do these covers,

31:20.940 --> 31:29.160
and that the publishers seem to think that my work sells books over just the title and the name of the author

31:29.960 --> 31:33.100
makes me think sometimes that our work has a lot to do with it.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.380
There are other times when you'll see a bestseller that has an absolutely wretched cover

31:37.380 --> 31:40.840
or has no... nothing but type on it that's selling quite well,

31:41.280 --> 31:44.920
then you think the cover art has absolutely nothing to do with it.

31:44.980 --> 31:46.280
So it's really hard to say.

31:46.280 --> 31:50.660
It's a balance, I think, between how famous the author is, how much publicity the book has gotten,

31:53.060 --> 31:59.480
and the expectations that people have had before the book has been published.

31:59.820 --> 32:01.980
A book like Foundations Edge.

32:02.600 --> 32:06.820
The Foundation series by Isaac Gasmav has a large readership.

32:07.580 --> 32:10.920
They've been waiting for this book and it's come out.

32:11.140 --> 32:15.620
They could have put a black cover with just the title Foundations Edge on it,

32:15.620 --> 32:18.180
and that thing would have sold off the shelf.

32:18.880 --> 32:22.540
But just to be sure, they've hired me to do the paperback cover for that book.

32:22.980 --> 32:36.080
But books that have large, very large, that are published in large publications have large budgets,

32:36.240 --> 32:38.480
and so they can afford to have a good cover for that.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.460
And I think that's why it's true as... see what's his name?

32:43.460 --> 32:46.200
The founder of Dell. His last name was Dellacourt.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.180
Don't remember his first name.

32:48.300 --> 32:54.100
Anyway, he said, what you do is when you have a good painter, good cover artist,

32:54.200 --> 32:56.820
use them for your best books or your worst books.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.420
That way you cover both of your bases.

33:00.940 --> 33:05.660
But he has especially accented the idea of using your best cover artists for your worst books,

33:05.760 --> 33:07.720
because then at least you minimize your losses.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.640
Everything on top of that is gravy.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.840
And so, I don't know.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.080
I asked one publisher if that was true, and she said yes.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.460
We'll put you on our worst books and on our best books.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.760
And if you can't tell a difference, that's fine with us, but if you can...

33:25.200 --> 33:25.860
That's her attitude.

33:26.460 --> 33:28.800
And I guess that's good, because that way I get to read some good ones.

33:28.900 --> 33:30.560
Lately, they've all been really great books.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.640
I haven't had any clinkers, so...

33:34.340 --> 33:37.000
I'll put it before the interview.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.720
Whether...let's say an editor is in there and they're reading this one.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.040
Oh boy, you've got to buy this from this guy.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.040
He said he would.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.200
Now we're going to stop with it.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.240
Get Waylon in here and have him do a discover.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.860
Yeah, that's happened many times.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.560
And in fact, I don't want to name names, so I can't.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.960
I won't, on this particular instance, because the writer is someone that I really like.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.880
And most of the work that this writer has done is excellent.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.700
But this particular piece was a real loser.

34:07.680 --> 34:12.380
I shouldn't have said what I said just a minute ago, that I haven't had many clinkers lately.

34:12.480 --> 34:17.060
This was a real clinker, and I did the cover within the last three months.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.320
And the painting was not one of my best.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.780
I'm proud of it, but I wouldn't put it up there with the white dragon.

34:24.040 --> 34:24.700
I'll put it that way.

34:24.700 --> 34:31.820
And I think my attitude towards doing the cover was directly derived from the lack of quality in the book

34:31.820 --> 34:33.140
and my disappointment with the book.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.360
And that does happen sometimes, unfortunately, in spite of myself.

34:38.580 --> 34:44.140
In your opinion, is science fiction and fantasy art getting better?

34:45.560 --> 34:46.520
Staying the same?

34:46.800 --> 34:48.380
Oh, it's definitely getting better.

34:48.700 --> 34:49.640
Getting better all the time.

34:50.740 --> 34:54.260
And despite my gloomy feelings about art schools and all that,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.880
the recognition for science fiction and fantasy art is starting to swing upwards.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.040
I've had one man shows in a few museums,

35:02.440 --> 35:10.100
and I've been part of group shows in some museums up north and in the east.

35:11.240 --> 35:15.800
And there is talk now among people in the Smithsonian, among other institutions,

35:16.020 --> 35:19.120
of having major science fiction-oriented art shows.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.640
If this starts happening, and we get this much needed critical appraisal,

35:23.640 --> 35:26.520
which is the main problem with science fiction art,

35:26.840 --> 35:29.620
is that there is no critiquing being done of it.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.680
Then I think we'll start to get some recognition.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.080
We'll get more critiques.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.440
Then we'll get investors interested in it, and the prices will come up,

35:41.480 --> 35:44.640
and it will reach a level of respectability comparable with, say, western art.

35:45.180 --> 35:51.140
Right now, old fantasy art, the work of Maxwell Parrish, Arthur Rackham, people like that,

35:52.000 --> 35:57.360
is fairly highly respected and commands decent prices, I would imagine.

35:57.860 --> 36:02.840
But new work is done at the bottom of the scale, and it's going to take some time.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.300
The same thing was true of science fiction literature.

36:05.980 --> 36:10.620
It was always in the ghetto, so to speak, as the writers often would say.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.040
What's out of the ghetto now?

36:12.340 --> 36:16.350
Literature is a commanding force on the bestseller list.

36:16.350 --> 36:20.470
The New York Times bestseller list has over half the items,

36:20.510 --> 36:27.110
are now so-called genre items, either for science fiction or fantasy books, commanding the bestseller list.

36:27.490 --> 36:28.630
It's out of the ghetto now.

36:28.830 --> 36:34.570
It's getting critical appraisal and some recognition as an art form in the literature field.

36:35.090 --> 36:39.050
It's time now for the art to do the same thing, and I don't think it'll be much longer until it does.

36:39.170 --> 36:44.630
It'll just require some extraordinary efforts on the part of the artist to get to go out

36:44.630 --> 36:47.290
and publicize it, to show it to the public.

36:48.310 --> 36:53.690
I have to say, whenever I've had a one-man show or been part of a group show of science fiction, fantasy, record,

36:54.110 --> 37:01.490
we have not had a show yet in a museum or gallery that has not broken all attendance records for previous shows in that gallery.

37:01.630 --> 37:06.330
It happened at the New Britain Museum of Art, it happened in the Canton Ohio Museum of Art,

37:06.390 --> 37:08.310
it happened in the Butler Museum of Art.

37:09.610 --> 37:14.530
They put in a science fiction or fantasy show and it'd break all attendance records for that particular museum.

37:14.750 --> 37:19.130
So there's an incredible support for this type of art among the general public.

37:19.250 --> 37:22.750
It's just going to take the snob sometimes to realize that and to realize that it's something,

37:23.030 --> 37:26.810
that there is some good art in there worthy of notice and critical appraisal.

37:28.010 --> 37:29.170
It's all tied together.

37:29.950 --> 37:37.530
Until the critics deign to look and say, some of this is good art and start spelling out what is good and what isn't,

37:37.530 --> 37:41.250
then it's not going to be considered seriously by the people who invest in art.

37:46.990 --> 37:52.630
I've got to say that, that is something that I'm really disappointed in,

37:52.690 --> 37:55.530
is that there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of...

37:57.270 --> 38:02.150
We need people who are willing to put their reputations on the line and say,

38:02.230 --> 38:04.910
this art is good and this person's art is not good.

38:09.610 --> 38:14.610
Being a self-supported group of people in science fiction and the fantasy community,

38:14.810 --> 38:17.430
everyone is mutually supportive and everyone tries to be democratic,

38:17.610 --> 38:19.290
but that's not the way the real world works.

38:22.650 --> 38:29.450
If you have an art show that has several excellent pieces of work in it and several bad things that

38:29.450 --> 38:34.110
the majority of people are going to look at and say, that's terrible, what's that doing in this show?

38:35.670 --> 38:38.350
People aren't going to take it very seriously because they're going to feel that

38:39.590 --> 38:45.370
science fiction art is basically anything that's weird or grotesque and that there's no standards for quality in the field.

38:46.530 --> 38:50.970
There are some people attempting to form an academy of science fiction and fantasy art,

38:51.690 --> 39:00.470
and this may help a lot in establishing a basis for standards or, well not standards,

39:00.470 --> 39:05.510
I'm not trying to get that across, let me say, basis for quality.

39:06.650 --> 39:12.330
For example, good rendering and basic things that make a piece of art good.

39:16.130 --> 39:20.210
Very little. Let's look at the western artists.

39:20.870 --> 39:26.770
The western art has a heritage, a heritage going back to Remington and other artists from back then.

39:27.610 --> 39:36.870
It's got a standard of quality, a benchmark with Remington and other artists for people to aspire to or to try to better,

39:38.350 --> 39:40.510
even if their styles are more modern or whatever.

39:41.350 --> 39:43.590
What does science fiction and fantasy art have?

39:43.950 --> 39:46.610
Well, it's got the art of the Polps from the 30s, and that's about it.

39:47.490 --> 39:48.930
Most of that art was a real dreck.

39:49.210 --> 39:54.410
Let's face it, when people look at it, even among the general public, it's considered pretty terrible art.

39:54.930 --> 40:02.230
Some of it was excellent, there's some excellent art from back then also, but there was a lot of terrible work.

40:02.590 --> 40:06.890
There have even been books published of the art of the Polps and everything,

40:07.090 --> 40:09.670
and this is what people see in the bookstores, they think science fiction art,

40:09.790 --> 40:17.410
they think of the old women in the brass brassiere fighting the tentacled monster in the cliche situations

40:17.410 --> 40:22.970
with a bubble helmet and everything, and hopefully Star Wars and some of the new movies

40:22.970 --> 40:24.990
that have been out in the last 10 years.

40:25.770 --> 40:31.190
Although it's tried to change that image, and if people become more aware of the art in the books also, that will change also.

40:33.930 --> 40:43.130
We're still fighting to overcome the bad taste left over from the art of the 30s and 40s, the Polp art.

40:43.590 --> 40:49.210
Have you had any inquiries into doing production design like in the rough McCory?

40:49.930 --> 40:50.750
Rough McCory.

40:50.910 --> 40:51.250
McCory?

40:51.250 --> 40:58.450
Yes, yes, I've even got an agent now in Hollywood who's fielding those for me.

40:59.310 --> 41:05.210
I've had a few real weirdos come up to me with these great movie proposals,

41:05.610 --> 41:11.690
and I've wasted so much time dealing with these people that I've had to finally get an agent to handle some of those.

41:12.070 --> 41:19.490
I am working on a movie project now that may develop into a full scale production, I don't know, we'll see.

41:20.050 --> 41:22.850
But I can't talk about what I'm getting into.

41:23.330 --> 41:31.510
I've signed a paper to the effect that I can't reveal any information about the movie until they choose to do so in a publicity release.

41:31.790 --> 41:32.790
Can we talk about it?

41:32.790 --> 41:36.230
What are you working on that you can't cover?

41:36.670 --> 41:37.890
Oh, that I can talk about?

41:39.690 --> 41:43.990
I just finished the cover for Foundations Edge for Isagasmop.

41:43.990 --> 41:49.270
There's a new dragon book by Ann McCaffrey that I'll start reading soon.

41:49.650 --> 41:53.370
I've got another year's best horror stories cover to do next month, or this month actually.

41:55.230 --> 41:55.970
April anyway.

41:56.390 --> 41:57.270
What month are we in here?

42:00.710 --> 42:04.530
There are so many things going on, it's really hard for me to remember them all.

42:05.470 --> 42:11.070
There's the final Fuzzing manuscript by HP, HP Lovecraft, HP and Piper.

42:12.170 --> 42:16.010
I am wrapping up a children's book, my first children's book.

42:17.330 --> 42:21.310
That's a collaboration with another artist named David Wenzel.

42:22.310 --> 42:24.030
It should be a real nice book.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.300
Let me think, we're doing...

42:29.790 --> 42:33.850
I've got a stack of manuscripts in my studio that's probably five feet high.

42:34.910 --> 42:37.790
They come in and I say, well, that looks like a fun one to do.

42:38.450 --> 42:41.310
I can fit in my schedule and then I put it in the pile and forget about it

42:41.770 --> 42:47.310
until I get done with the painting before that one is due and pick up the manuscript and say, oh yeah, this one.

42:48.310 --> 42:50.330
I've forgotten what and all my projects are.

42:50.370 --> 42:53.510
I've done books as much as a year in advance at any particular time.

42:54.610 --> 42:56.310
That certainly is the situation now.

42:56.310 --> 43:00.790
I remember, there's some of them that I remember.

43:02.450 --> 43:06.910
Those are the ongoing projects in the Dragon one because I've got a special interest in it.

43:06.990 --> 43:12.570
McCaffrey's work, but that's all I think of off the top of my head.

43:15.130 --> 43:18.150
How many projects do you have going on at one time? Paintings?

43:18.310 --> 43:20.990
I usually like to keep it to just one.

43:21.110 --> 43:24.150
I hate to divide my interest between one painting and another project.

43:25.710 --> 43:28.870
I go to Great Lanks to maintain a mood throughout a painting.

43:29.770 --> 43:33.450
I did a painting that took place on a sandy planet, for example, it was all desert.

43:35.370 --> 43:40.030
I recorded a six hour tape of all wind noises and like wind in the desert.

43:40.170 --> 43:45.310
I just played that while I was painting the painting because I wanted to keep in the mood

43:45.310 --> 43:48.910
and the feeling of that book and that painting.

43:51.070 --> 43:56.190
I'd hate to be in the middle of that planet and that scene and trying to develop this environment

43:56.190 --> 43:59.490
and then have to break it into a painting of something horrible or something, or whatever.

44:01.270 --> 44:04.810
But it's sometimes a force too and it's happened a couple of times.

44:04.990 --> 44:08.230
But I'm usually good enough at juggling my schedule around so I don't have to.

44:11.110 --> 44:16.190
It is very beneficial sometimes to have a break after doing all the sketches.

44:16.190 --> 44:21.270
I've sent the sketches into the publisher and they're looking those over for me to do another project

44:21.270 --> 44:24.250
because when the sketches come back to me I see them with a fresh eye.

44:25.090 --> 44:29.070
Even though the publisher may have picked one particular one, I may find a different one

44:29.070 --> 44:33.070
that I think it really is better for the book after all and I'll throw the other ones aside.

44:33.510 --> 44:37.150
I'll talk it over with the publisher and we'll figure out a way to compromise on them or something.

44:37.350 --> 44:39.750
Or they'll let me go ahead and do the one I want to do.

44:43.050 --> 44:47.950
But that is good to have a break between going through all the analyzing, the collating,

44:48.190 --> 44:57.470
and doing the sketches before doing the final painting is good to have a break in there.

44:58.230 --> 45:04.010
While I'm actually doing the big rendering, I hate to have to break that into another one.

45:05.790 --> 45:09.830
That's one of the reasons why I have a strong dislike for advertising work.

45:10.650 --> 45:14.710
Advertising work always involves having to do extra work on a painting.

45:15.210 --> 45:19.150
You do a piece, it's the only time that ever happens to me, never happens to me with paperback covers.

45:19.290 --> 45:20.730
I get something sent back to me for changes.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.250
But I'll do an advertising job.

45:23.650 --> 45:27.670
Well, advertising jobs are almost always judged by committee.

45:28.250 --> 45:31.250
Men in the advertising company and someone always has to come up with an idea

45:31.790 --> 45:34.950
that makes it sound like he's worth being hired to work in this company.

45:35.170 --> 45:38.350
So if a piece of artwork gets passed around for a particular client, they'll look at it and they'll say,

45:38.390 --> 45:40.770
well, I think this and everyone's got to have an idea.

45:42.190 --> 45:45.430
And some of the ideas are the most stupid things I've ever heard in my life.

45:46.050 --> 45:48.410
I'll tell you, working for advertising companies are really something.

45:48.750 --> 45:55.110
And don't think of anything to put in, to have some input in this particular committee meeting about my piece of work

45:55.110 --> 45:56.590
or any artist's piece of work.

45:56.590 --> 46:01.330
I don't know any artist that doesn't have things sent back from advertising agencies and stuff on a regular basis.

46:02.630 --> 46:07.370
And so I'll be working out, I will finish the painting, send it into an ad company or whatever.

46:07.670 --> 46:11.750
I'll be on the next one and then the thing will come back to me because I want changes here

46:11.750 --> 46:14.870
or brighten up this or take this out or whatever.

46:15.810 --> 46:20.710
Then I'll have to stop and work on that other one to make the changes and send that back in.

46:20.810 --> 46:22.310
Then I can go back to the painting I was working on.

46:22.410 --> 46:23.790
And I hate that so much.

46:23.790 --> 46:25.850
That's why I avoid doing a lot of advertising job.

46:26.710 --> 46:29.650
I mean, I charge them for the extra work and all that.

46:29.790 --> 46:33.030
And that kind of discourages them from sending it back to me.

46:34.310 --> 46:35.910
But a lot of times it doesn't.

46:37.770 --> 46:41.050
Let's get into glass, onion graphics a little bit.

46:42.370 --> 46:44.190
Why did you decide to open that up?

46:48.230 --> 46:49.770
It was a gradual process.

46:50.710 --> 46:53.830
I'd always wanted to make prints of my work available.

46:54.690 --> 46:59.410
Most of my work sells for pretty high prices and fans simply can't afford it.

47:00.050 --> 47:02.850
And when I go to a convention, I like to have something that they can afford to buy.

47:03.710 --> 47:07.330
And the way around that is by doing prints and posters of my work.

47:09.570 --> 47:11.930
Glass, onion graphics was created to fill that need.

47:11.930 --> 47:19.570
Now my wife has helped me out a lot by doing my bookkeeping, for example, and other things.

47:19.790 --> 47:25.610
She stopped doing what she was doing in order to help me out in my business to a certain extent.

47:26.370 --> 47:28.630
And glass, onion graphics was kind of an extension of that.

47:28.950 --> 47:31.410
I said, if you want to go ahead and make a print of my work, I'd be really happy.

47:31.530 --> 47:38.270
You can take all the profit and everything, as long as we have print available for fans to buy or whatever.

47:38.870 --> 47:41.510
And she's turned it into a full-scale business.

47:41.670 --> 47:46.410
Now she's so busy, she doesn't have time to do my bookkeeping and all this other stuff that we originally were going to do.

47:46.990 --> 47:50.050
We've had to hire extra people, we have a secretary and whatever.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.990
But now it's grown into a full-scale business.
