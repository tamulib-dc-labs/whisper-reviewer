00:01.000 --> 00:10.460
He operated a bulldozer in Puerto Rico in a hotel in the West Indies. He trained
as a circus aerialist, served three years as a seaman, and worked in

00:10.460 --> 00:19.600
advertising. Now, if you think this sounds like the typical biography of an
American author, you're right. His name is Theodore Sturgeon, but he's not

00:19.600 --> 00:30.920
exactly typical. His numerous stories and novels are chiefly in the area of
science fiction or fantasy. He's one of only three writers who have won all

00:30.920 --> 00:40.280
three of the major science fiction awards, the International Fantasy Award, the
Hugo, and the Nebula Awards. Mr. Sturgeon has been in the area attending

00:40.280 --> 00:52.720
Conclave 3, a meeting of science fiction writers and fans sponsored by the
Eastern Michigan University Science Fiction Society. Mr. Sturgeon, let me leap

00:52.720 --> 01:07.680
feet foremost into this And I'll ask you first what in your view is the major
difference between science fiction today and other types of imaginative writing?

01:08.020 --> 01:16.740
Well, essentially you're asking me for a definition of science fiction and I
have to tell you at the outset that nobody has yet succeeded in defining science

01:16.740 --> 01:25.780
fiction in a way that does not leak with the possible exception of Damon Knight
who said science fiction is whatever you happen to be pointing at when you're

01:25.780 --> 01:37.980
talking about it. There are those who claim that I have never written a science
fiction story in my life. These are the hardcore nuts and bolts, zap guns, space

01:37.980 --> 01:50.400
flight, hard chemistry, hard biology type. They don't feel that science fiction
is science fiction without it. A gimmick. That's right. Good science fiction

01:50.400 --> 02:01.120
has, first of all, I think, to be good fiction. Good fiction is people. A lot of
science fiction does lack that particular quality. Those qualities of compassion

02:01.120 --> 02:14.260
and of love and of internal growth and so on where the person is the most
important thing. Good fiction is the interaction between people and ideas. If

02:14.260 --> 02:23.840
you write a story about an idea only, you might have something very compelling,
but it's a tract. It isn't a story. And so I really start from there, and this

02:23.840 --> 02:32.380
is why, as I say, I have been accused by the hardcore science fiction addicts of
not writing real science fiction at all. Yet I have done a lot about space

02:32.380 --> 02:44.600
flight and about biology and about evolution and so on. Well, I sometimes
wonder, for instance, a writer like Donald Barthelme is not so very far in some

02:44.600 --> 02:52.000
ways... ...from some science fiction writers. This is a very interesting thing.
Science fiction is coming out of its own special ghetto, which it lived for

02:52.000 --> 03:01.640
about 40 years. There's an interesting thing about people who survive ghetto
living. They come out strong because if they're going to survive at all they

03:01.640 --> 03:11.760
have to be a little bit stronger. I think you'll find a larger percentage of
good writing and of really fascinating good inventive thinking in the area of

03:11.760 --> 03:21.180
science fiction than you'll find in anywhere else. You see it exploding all
around you now. In 1965 there were two courses in science fiction One in

03:21.180 --> 03:33.460
Pennsylvania and one in eastern New Mexico. This year there are close to 3,000.
And one of my endeavors recently has been teaching teachers, teaching symposia

03:33.460 --> 03:41.760
of teachers of science fiction, because with 3,000 courses there isn't anybody
to teach it without taking a special course. What they end up doing is teaching

03:41.760 --> 03:52.900
writing, really. Essentially, yeah, and there's really nothing wrong with that.
Now, there's a snob situation involved here, too. Vladimir Nabokov's last, I

03:52.900 --> 04:01.280
think it was his last novel, it was called Ada. And it's an alternate universe
story in which the Germans won the First World War. It is definitely a science

04:01.280 --> 04:09.460
fiction story. Nobody calls Nabokov a science fiction writer. Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
refuses to be called a science fiction writer. He's afraid it'll affect his

04:09.460 --> 04:22.200
sales. Well, you've got a man like Thomas Pynchon writing what occurs to me very
much like science fiction. It certainly is. and didn't he write, or V? V is

04:22.200 --> 04:32.060
Thomas Pynchon. Yeah, which also was a science fiction. Sir Doris Lessing is a
very highly touted literary writer. That's right, her last novel about London

04:32.060 --> 04:42.140
and the future. That's right. Kingsley Amis, with whom I violently disagree on
most points, did make a very, very good one. When he said that the reaction of

04:42.140 --> 04:53.000
the so-called serious critic and the public at large is, hey, this is science
fiction, it can't be good. Or, hey, this is good, it can't be science fiction.

04:54.000 --> 05:06.040
You have stated elsewhere that you try to alter your style constantly. And I
wonder about that. Don't you think that every author unconsciously identifies

05:06.040 --> 05:15.340
himself through a style which he develops? Not every author. It's true, you can
get an awful long way in the literary business by developing a style and being

05:15.340 --> 05:27.520
inventive about it. Hemingway did it, for example. Bradbury is a perfect
example. With a little bit of study and some natural talent, you can sit down

05:27.520 --> 05:38.720
and write one paragraph of perfect Hemingway, one paragraph of perfect
Steinbeck. But wouldn't you prefer to be identified as yourself, as Sturgeon,

05:38.720 --> 05:46.620
rather than Bradbury, or Hemingway, or whoever? In a way, yes. But you see, I
think that that, in a way, is a limitation. there is a distinction between

05:46.620 --> 05:55.620
something which is original and something which is unique. Something as original
is that something can be done the first time and once people see how it's done,

05:55.820 --> 06:05.960
everybody can do it. Mickey Spillane was, in that sense, an original. As soon as
he did what he did, hundreds of writers started doing the same thing. And

06:05.960 --> 06:21.640
Hemingway, also the same thing. And Steinbeck to a degree. even Kipling and
Robert Louis Stephenson had a very distinctive style, H. Ryder Haggard But just

06:21.640 --> 06:31.880
try to write a paragraph, an identifiable paragraph of Samuel R. Delany, for
example, a science fiction writer and a writer of the highest caliber When he

06:31.880 --> 06:41.240
writes Black Ghetto, it is the real thing When in the novel people are
discussing modern American poetry, they do it in the idiom of William Carlos

06:41.240 --> 06:51.760
Williams, and he knows what he's talking about. He can change the whole texture
and style of what he's saying. And this is a quality that I admire very, very

06:51.760 --> 07:00.920
much indeed. Do you get bogged down sometimes, however, in the attempt to change
your style? No. Does it just come naturally? Not particularly. I guess it's, I

07:00.920 --> 07:10.900
have a good ear. And I'm more interested in people than in anything else, and I
listen to people. And I report either what it is they say or what it is I wish

07:10.900 --> 07:22.200
they had said, but in the way they say it. And of course eliminating the errs
and ahs and hmms that you run across. If you've ever read, and I know you have,

07:22.340 --> 07:33.580
of course in your business you would have, a typed transcript of a speech.
Terrible. It's just awful, yeah. It really is. You've also been quoted as saying

07:33.580 --> 07:45.300
that writing is a way of getting even with people. Now that sounds very
pessimistic, misanthropic, and you definitely are not that sort of a person

07:45.300 --> 07:58.140
yourself. What did you mean by that? Well, I think this is true really of all
writers, particularly writers who take their craft seriously. And yet often,

07:58.260 --> 08:07.620
unbeknownst to the writer himself, he is, in that sense, getting even. Getting
even is not necessarily a vengeful thing. Sometimes it's an attempt to

08:07.620 --> 08:18.520
understand why you were hurt. Why did this person hurt me? You're puzzled,
you're bewildered. You write a story and before you know it, there's a character

08:18.520 --> 08:31.420
in there who has been hurt in the same way. And from the narrative, even if it's
a subplot or a subsidiary line in the story, a reason for that hurt evolves. You

08:31.420 --> 08:39.660
begin to understand better why you were hurt and perhaps you recognize the fact
you deserve to be hurt in that instance. So it isn't a particularly vengeful

08:39.660 --> 08:48.740
thing of getting even. It's a question of understanding your fellow human
beings. I assume that you have developed some fairly strong opinions, beliefs

08:48.740 --> 09:01.040
over the years, whether it be in the area of society or politics or whatever. Do
you consciously utilize these beliefs in your stories, attempt to grind a

09:01.040 --> 09:10.580
certain axe, let's say? I think rather than trying to persuade anybody else to
my way of thinking, I continually attempt to crystallize my own thinking. If

09:10.580 --> 09:22.360
there's a flaw in its logic, if there's a prejudice, if there's an unthought
conclusion, it becomes open for grabs. And one of my characters is a bigot, for

09:22.360 --> 09:29.380
example. I expose his bigotry. I pursue his logic until it becomes ridiculous.

09:32.500 --> 09:46.640
or I do analogies of people. I remember I wrote a story one time essentially
about Joseph McCarthy. It was a parallel story. It was cast in the future. It

09:46.640 --> 09:55.540
dealt with other planets and space flight and so on. But I felt very strongly
about that at the time and I had to figure out what it is that the man was

09:55.540 --> 10:06.000
doing. Why was he doing what he was doing Aside from, of course, he was after a
certain amount of power. And there was that within him, which demanded a lot of

10:06.000 --> 10:15.380
public attention. But those things are basically superficial. Why did he want
public attention? Why did he want power? What were his motivations there? And so

10:15.380 --> 10:26.640
in the character, there was a story called Mr. Costello, Hero. I went right down
to the nitty-gritty to find out why a man does a thing like that. But Joe

10:26.640 --> 10:34.980
McCarthy, incidentally, was a very fascinating man. He had two sets of
realities. One of them was the one that stood up in front of the microphones and

10:34.980 --> 10:50.580
waved a paper in his hands and said, I hold in my hand 248 names of communists
in the State Department. And another naive, kind of almost childlike. I remember

10:50.580 --> 10:58.720
one episode where he was riding in an elevator with Richard Rovere, a reporter
who did a great deal of work on him. And Dean Acheson, a man he had virtually

10:58.720 --> 11:09.480
destroyed, stepped into the elevator. And McCarthy said, Hey, Dean, how you
been? In a very friendly way, Acheson's lips got white, his ears got red.

11:10.540 --> 11:20.300
Elevator stopped and he got out. And McCarthy turned to Richard Rovere and said,
Hey, what's the matter with him? Is he mad at me? And that was said in real

11:20.300 --> 11:31.060
innocence, in absolute innocence, There's a part missing in people like that.
See, I'm not holding him up as a devil at all, but as a very, very fascinating

11:31.060 --> 11:44.120
kind of human being. Mr. Sturgeon, it occurs to me that a great deal of science
fiction writing is negativistic in a way because so many stories deal with

11:44.120 --> 11:56.980
utopias and how they fail, that they aren't real utopias. They're not ideal
societies. I have thought of something not many people seem to have thought of

11:56.980 --> 12:06.820
about utopias. You see, well, let me go back to something like this. The cells
in your body are different at this moment than they were when you walked into

12:06.820 --> 12:17.400
the studio. There's a perpetual growth and change within you and with anything
that's alive. And for that matter, the planet that we're on, it started in some

12:17.400 --> 12:28.820
coalescing gases and it's going to end in a bunch of cinders. The process
between those two has not stopped. We're sitting on an island of granite afloat

12:28.820 --> 12:38.280
on a sea of hot mush on a planet which is in motion around its primary. The sun
itself is in motion in the galaxy. The galaxies are all tumbling around in and

12:38.280 --> 12:48.800
amongst each other. Even the space between is in kind of a turmoil. If your time
scale is large enough you can see the whole thing boiling. the only unnatural

12:48.800 --> 12:58.880
practice that I can think of truly unnatural practice is to stop for a living
thing to just stop and yet there is that about human beings which makes them

12:58.880 --> 13:12.240
want to stop now we are where you mentioned utopias virtually without exception
the utopia is a static situation you have you orient yourself toward a goal

13:12.240 --> 13:21.560
where everything is all neat and all the buildings are built around the lake and
they all have ten stories and the people move back and forth and nod and smile

13:21.560 --> 13:31.860
at each other and love each other a bunch. But there's no more beyond that.
Maybe internal expansion, and I can't knock that. I mean, the people perhaps are

13:31.860 --> 13:44.060
learning more and experiencing more within themselves. Nevertheless, virtually
all utopias from Plato right on up have this quality of being perfected

13:44.060 --> 13:54.000
instruments like pyramids, like the Egyptian pyramids, finished with a single
stone on top. Well, life isn't like that. People aren't like that. If I were to

13:54.000 --> 14:03.860
design a utopia, it would be one of dynamic equilibrium rather than static. It
would be the kind of equilibrium that a gull has when it flies. It has to be in

14:03.860 --> 14:15.820
motion in order to remain aloft. All life is like that. Is there a tendency to
become pessimistic about the future? Not as long as, as I say, we can combat

14:15.820 --> 14:26.260
this hunger for stasis that I think is the human being's greatest disease. He
wants it locked in. In spite of what you see in the magazines, diamonds are not

14:26.260 --> 14:36.320
forever. They really are not forever. Nothing is forever in that sense. And if
you can recognize that and design your life and your politics and your morality

14:36.880 --> 14:45.800
in a sense of ongoing and evolution and growth and deeper understanding, but
always perpetual movement, then I think you have something like a utopian

14:45.800 --> 14:57.980
situation. But it's a dynamic utopia, you see. Well, progress, in quotation
marks, has gotten a bad name many times in the past. Mostly from people who

14:57.980 --> 15:06.720
don't like the way progress is going. I mean, there was probably a lot of lip
pulling about coming down out of the trees or out of the caves. You know, it's

15:06.720 --> 15:18.500
good enough for my grandfather, and it's good enough for you, kid. So many
people, I suppose they're writers mainly, are always curious about the habits of

15:18.500 --> 15:31.160
another writer and the possibility of his writing blocks and how he gets going
and does he have periods of total lethargy and so forth? Do you have any

15:31.160 --> 15:39.740
secrets? I am the world's greatest expert on writer's blocks. I had one once
that lasted for six years. Six years. And you know, when you've got wives and

15:39.740 --> 15:52.420
children and like that, And the rent's due and so on. And your income is writing
and you dry up for six years. It's pretty rough, very rough. I think I venture

15:52.420 --> 16:02.300
to say I can cure virtually anybody's writer's block because it's something that
I have involved myself in very profoundly. I cannot always cure my own. But I

16:02.300 --> 16:13.300
had a profound insight one time. I had a major breakdown in 1965. I mean, I
really came to be, it was a close thing. And fortunately I fell into the hands

16:13.300 --> 16:22.680
of somebody who, ideally he was a Sturgeon fan. This guy, I swear he'd read more
Sturgeon than Sturgeon has written. He could quote whole paragraphs, which is

16:22.680 --> 16:33.540
more than I can do. And he pointed out in that six-year period the work that I
had done before that and the work that I had done subsequent to that period.

16:33.680 --> 16:41.440
Because one of the things that was wrong with me, I was bewailing those six
years. Six years is enough time to get a Pulitzer Prize or make a half a million

16:41.440 --> 16:53.060
bucks you know and uh those six years had gone by and everybody was scarred by
it and and so on and uh i was mourning that fact in this uh the lost years and

16:53.060 --> 17:01.520
that it would never come back and so on he pointed out to me that that the
quality of work that i'd done before that and what was done afterwards not only

17:01.520 --> 17:09.140
the quality but the content he said what i'd done before were essentially
entertainments and nobody's knocking entertainments we need them like we need

17:09.140 --> 17:18.880
vitamins. But the stuff that I was doing afterwards was of a totally different
sort. He called them therapy stories. Well, he was a therapist, and that was his

17:18.880 --> 17:26.880
particular bias. But it's true. Virtually everything that I've written since
then has been about people who are sick and get well, or people who are well and

17:26.880 --> 17:35.940
get better at whatever they are. Well, obviously you were growing during that
time. That's the point that he made. He said, you are mourning the fact that the

17:35.940 --> 17:45.780
work stopped. He said the work didn't stop. The pages stopped coming out. But he
said, that's a triviality. The work continued. And he said, this is documented

17:45.780 --> 17:53.540
by the work you've done. And that was a huge thing for me to find out. I mean,
I'm never going to get depressed about that again. And if I go through a period

17:53.540 --> 18:02.380
where no pages come out for weeks or even months, I'm not particularly
concerned. I find that when I'm writing, I'm not writing, I'm typing. In some

18:02.380 --> 18:11.140
strange way, it's all done. And suddenly I'll sit down and the typewriter for 30
hours and type until I fall over sideways. I've produced a 21,000 word novelette

18:11.140 --> 18:23.500
without getting up from the desk. But, you know, like 18 or 20 hours. And it's
all done. And oddly enough, the internal structure of the story, the subsidiary

18:23.500 --> 18:34.280
plots, the subsidiary characters themselves, the placing of climax and
denouement and so on, it's all there. It's all finished. You interrupted me in

18:34.280 --> 18:42.420
the middle and asked me, how is this going to end? and in what way I wouldn't be
able to tell you. That's a peculiar internal thing. Do you turn to other kinds

18:42.420 --> 18:52.060
of stories as relief, let's say, from science fiction? Not as relief, but often
another vehicle

18:52.060 --> 19:02.220
will say what I want to say better. And as a result, I've written romances. I
have a book of Western stories, and they're not like anybody else's Western

19:02.220 --> 19:10.520
stories, but they're legitimate Western stories. Oh, my God. And, yeah, I've
written a great many, well, we're back to the same thing where the addicts will

19:10.520 --> 19:20.060
say that Sturgeon does not write real science fiction. No, essentially I write
people stories. You've worked in scenarios for films, have you now? Yeah. I went

19:20.060 --> 19:28.340
out to the West Coast originally 12 years ago to write Star Trek. I wrote six, I
sold four, and I aired two, which is pretty well powerful, of course. And those

19:28.340 --> 19:38.760
two have been showcased very well. They were very successful. There are any Star
Trek addicts out there They were A Mock Time. For those who are very familiar

19:38.760 --> 19:48.780
with Star Trek, which shows were these? Yeah. A Mock Time was one of them. The
other was called Shore Leave. And they've been very successful. Have you worked

19:48.780 --> 19:59.840
on full-length feature films? Not specifically, no. One of my stories,
Killdozer, which is I think one of the best stories I ever wrote. I mentioned

19:59.840 --> 20:08.440
when I dried up for six years. in the middle of that six year period for nine
days I could write and I wrote Killdozer and it's right first draft exactly

20:08.440 --> 20:19.120
where you read it all the way through and and then it shut down again and it was
brought by Universal Pictures and they made a movie of the week out of it and it

20:19.120 --> 20:29.040
is a dog it is awful I mean really you can't fault the D9 they use they use a
Caterpillar D9 which is a marvelous machine I've been in love with those big

20:29.040 --> 20:39.940
machines for years anyhow I'm still a Class A heavy equipment operator. As a
person who deals with the imagination, imaginative things, do you think that

20:39.940 --> 20:54.780
this emphasis on the visual, interpreting all of these stories through pictures,
is detrimental to writing of science fiction? It's hard to say. There's a man

20:54.780 --> 21:06.220
called Byron Price in New York who is getting out a whole line of what they call
graphics, graphic novels, which are as much pictures as they are prose. And they

21:06.220 --> 21:15.420
have something to be said for them. But I think it's essentially... Super comic
books, though. That's right. But it's another kind of fiction. I mean, just as

21:15.420 --> 21:24.080
there are kinds of music. There's chamber music and there's symphonic music and
there's rock and there's country and so on. And each conveys to its audience

21:24.080 --> 21:35.040
what its audience really wants. And so I don't knock it. I am afraid that people
are going to stop reading which is an interesting thing You know, back in the

21:35.040 --> 21:44.260
15th and 16th century if a guy worked on shoes he put a big boot up over his
store and if a guy sold horses he put a big horse up over his store because

21:44.260 --> 21:51.800
people couldn't read Well, you know, we're getting back to that It's not only
watching television all the time but the international signs you know, you've

21:51.800 --> 22:00.960
got a sign for the ladies room and you've got a sign for a telephone and you've
got a sign for their baggage pickup and so on, all these little pictographs. And

22:00.960 --> 22:12.660
pretty soon we're just going to be watching the tube and looking at pictographs
and what price really fine finish prose. In spite of the fact that the gimmickry

22:12.660 --> 22:24.680
is superior, do you think we've gone downhill from Star Trek to Battlestar
Galactica? But Battlestar Galactica suffers primarily from the ripoff. I mean,

22:24.780 --> 22:40.000
they take things that are guaranteed successes and redo them in the Galactica
format. For example, Jane and I saw Shane on Battlestar Galactica virtually down

22:40.000 --> 22:51.760
the line. And this is what they do. Whatever has been successful, and they put
it in the science fiction format and it works, Star Trek was its own highly

22:51.760 --> 23:04.940
original thing. The success of Star Trek, the moguls, people try to imitate it
and fail. The main reason they fail is that Star Trek was started and promoted

23:04.940 --> 23:18.280
and still is by a man who had ideals. He really did. Gene Roddenberry believes
in such things as patriotism, the American democratic ideal, and the equality of

23:18.280 --> 23:28.320
the sexes in the equality of the races. He believes in these things very deeply,
his own personal belief. And in every episode of Star Trek, he exploited and

23:28.320 --> 23:38.300
expressed these beliefs. And that's really what reached people. It wasn't so
much Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock's pointed ears and so on. It was the underlying

23:38.300 --> 23:47.620
faith that the man had in his own ideal. A lot of people who will say that
that's corny and ho-hum and hooray, let's wrap ourselves in the American flag.

23:48.080 --> 23:56.860
It isn't that it goes very much deeper than that. People really do want
something to believe in. Space 1999 and even Galactica don't really seem to give

23:56.860 --> 24:07.260
much of a damn about anything except getting this show on the air next season.
But Gene Roddenberry believed very profoundly in these things, using Star Trek

24:07.260 --> 24:22.420
to express them. From the visual to other art forms, I know you are an
appreciator of music. Do you sometimes feel or wish that you were a composer

24:22.420 --> 24:30.340
rather than a writer? Could you express some of your ideas better in some other
form, either as a composer or an artist? There are things that you can say in

24:30.340 --> 24:31.740
music that you can't say in words.

24:34.640 --> 24:43.740
I suddenly thought of Giancarlo Minotti, who wrote The Medium. Somebody wrote
him once as a triple threat artist.

24:44.860 --> 24:54.360
He was a director, and who was a composer and he was a librettist and he said oh
no not triple double and the interviewer said what do you mean double he said

24:54.360 --> 25:05.000
well yes I'm a director but he said as far as the rest of it the words come to
me encased in music to him they were all the same thing which is a very

25:05.000 --> 25:16.140
interesting way of expressing it but sometimes music alone there's a guitar
etude by Fernando Sor which someday I'm going to write lyrics to but it just

25:16.140 --> 25:27.360
absolutely takes me apart to listen to. I think the greatest piece of music ever
composed was the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor by Bach. It's architectured in

25:27.360 --> 25:39.420
such an extraordinary way. It establishes a 15-note theme and simply repeats it
over and over again, by rephrasing it and throwing it to various parts of the

25:39.420 --> 25:49.480
orchestra. Whether he composed it for an orchestra or not is beside the point.
and winding up with a monumental diss chord. Everything is huge. It's a great

25:49.480 --> 26:00.380
crashing 115-piece chord that leans over sideways and is about to fall over.
Then he backs off and he gives it to you in C major, having written in C minor

26:00.380 --> 26:10.020
the whole time. And you just go away feeling good. And I don't know how you do
that in prose. I really don't think. You have a new collection of stories that's

26:10.020 --> 26:21.640
just out. Yeah, it's called Visions and Visionaries. it's from Dell it's the
first of five books that Dell is getting out within the next year 18 months are

26:21.640 --> 26:28.160
most of these short story collections? No, two of them are novels two of them
are full novels the other three are collections do you find it more difficult to

26:28.160 --> 26:39.920
write a full length work than a short story? it depends on the idea that's
pushing you often you'll start to write a short story and it expands itself into

26:39.920 --> 26:50.320
a novelette or even into a novel It's interesting how that happens too. Often
you get a very powerful idea and it plunges you right into it and you keep

26:50.320 --> 26:58.620
working it and working it until ultimately you find that it needs to be cut and
what you cut is the original idea that started the whole thing because it's

26:58.620 --> 27:06.740
taken the bit in its teeth and run off in another direction. Mr. Sturgeon, it's
been delightful talking with you. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank

27:06.740 --> 27:10.760
you and it's been a pleasure to talk to you. You ask some fine questions. You
really do. Thank you.
