00:01.120 --> 00:10.660
He operated a bulldozer in Puerto Rico and a hotel on the West Indies. He
trained as a circus aerialist to serve three years as a semen and worked in

00:10.660 --> 00:20.080
advertising. Now, if you think this sounds like the typical biography of an
American author, you're right. His name is Theodore Stagen, but he's not exactly

00:20.080 --> 00:32.000
typical. He is numerous stories and novels or chiefly in the area of science
fiction or fantasy. He's one of only three writers of one all three of the major

00:32.000 --> 00:44.520
science fiction awards, the International Fantasy Award, the Hugo and the Nebula
Awards. Mr. Stagen has been in the area attending Conclave 3, a meeting of

00:44.520 --> 00:55.040
science fiction writers and fans sponsored by the Eastern Michigan University
Science of science fiction society. The Stagen let me leap-feet foremost into

00:55.040 --> 01:09.820
this and ask you first what in your view is the major difference between science
fiction today and other types of imaginative writing. Well, essentially you're

01:09.820 --> 01:17.780
asking me for a definition of science fiction and I have to tell you what the
outset. The nobody has yet succeeded into finding science fiction in a way that

01:17.780 --> 01:28.220
does not leak with a possible exception of Damon Knight who said science fiction
is whatever you happen to be pointing at when you're talking about it. There are

01:28.220 --> 01:40.200
those who claim that I have never written a science fiction story in my life.
These are the hardcore nuts and bolts, Zap Guns, Space Flight, Hard Chemistry,

01:40.520 --> 01:51.500
Hard Biology, Divernd, they don't feel that science fiction is science fiction
without it. Are gimmick. That's right. Good science fiction has first of all I

01:51.500 --> 02:03.220
think to be good fiction. Good fiction is people. A lot of science fiction does
lack that particular quality. Those qualities of compassion and of love and of

02:03.220 --> 02:12.220
internal growth and so on where the person is the most important thing. Good
fiction is the interaction between people and people or the interaction between

02:12.220 --> 02:23.100
people and ideas. If you're interested about an idea only, you might have
something very compelling but it's a tracked, it isn't a story. And so I really

02:23.100 --> 02:31.480
start from there and this is why as I say I have been accused by the hard course
science fiction addicts of not writing real science fiction at all. Yet I have

02:31.480 --> 02:41.400
done a lot about spaceflight and about biology and about evolution and so on.
Well I sometimes wonder, a friend's a radio like Donald Bartholomey,

02:42.640 --> 02:51.520
is not so very far. No, some ways from science fiction. This is a very
interesting thing. Science fiction is coming out of its own special ghetto which

02:51.520 --> 03:01.240
is live for about 40 years. There's an interesting thing about people who
survive ghetto living. They come out strong because if they're going to survive

03:01.240 --> 03:11.560
at all, they have to be a little bit stronger. And I think you'll find a larger
percentage of good writing and of really fascinating, good inventive thinking in

03:11.560 --> 03:20.600
the area of science fiction than you'll find it anywhere else. You see it
exploding all around you now. In 1965 there were two courses in science fiction,

03:21.060 --> 03:33.000
one in Pennsylvania and one in eastern New Mexico. This year there are close to
3,000 and one of my endeavors that recently has been teaching teachers teaching

03:33.000 --> 03:41.340
symposium of teachers science fiction. Because with 3,000 courses there's
anybody to teach it without taking a special course. Or what they end up doing

03:41.340 --> 03:52.940
is teaching writing really essentially. And there's really nothing wrong with
that. Now there's a snob situation involved here too. Vladimir Navikov's last I

03:52.940 --> 04:01.620
think it was his last novel called Ada. And it's an alternate universe story and
was the Germans won the first World War. It is definitely a science fiction

04:01.620 --> 04:11.980
story. Nobody calls Navikov a science fiction writer. Kurt Wannigot Jr refuses
to be called a science fiction writer. He's a faded or a fictive sales. And what

04:11.980 --> 04:24.460
do you got a man like Thomas Pension writing? Gravity's name is very much like
science fiction. It certainly is. And in the right or V is to pinch on. Which

04:24.460 --> 04:33.340
also was science fiction. So Dars' last thing is very highly touted literary
writing. It's right here when I novel about the London and the future. That's

04:33.340 --> 04:43.140
right. Gains the aim is with whom I violently disagree on most points. It did
make a very, very good one. When he said that the reaction of the so-called

04:43.140 --> 04:55.020
serious critic and the public at large is, Hey, this is science fiction. It
can't be good. Or hey, this is good. It can't be science fiction. You have

04:55.020 --> 05:07.020
stated elsewhere that you try to alter your style constantly. I wonder about
that. Don't you think that every author and consciously identifies himself

05:07.020 --> 05:15.940
through a style, what he does all of. Not every author. It's true you can get an
offer along the literary business by developing a style and being invented by

05:15.940 --> 05:27.960
the Hemingway did it. For example, Bradbury is a perfect example. But you know,
with a little bit of study and some natural talent, you can sit down and write

05:27.960 --> 05:38.500
one paragraph of perfect Hemingway. One paragraph of perfect Steinbeck. But
would you prefer to be identified as yourself as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as,

05:38.500 --> 05:46.760
for a while than rather than Bradbury or Hemingway or who. Anyway, yeah, but do
you see, I think that that in ways of limitation. There is a distinction between

05:46.760 --> 05:55.320
something which is original and something which is unique. Uh, something as
original is that something can be done the first time and once people see how

05:55.320 --> 06:04.560
it's done, Everybody can do it. Mickey Spelaine was in that sense in original.
As soon as he did, what he did by, uh, hundreds of writers started to do the

06:04.560 --> 06:20.140
same thing. and Hemingway also was saving a Stein back to a degree, even
Kippling, and Robert Lewis Stevenson had a very distinctive style, H.W. H.W.

06:20.140 --> 06:32.000
Hager. But just try to write a paragraph and identify a paragraph of Samuel R.
Delaney, for example, a science fiction writer of the highest caliber. When he

06:32.000 --> 06:41.340
writes Black and Ghetto, it is the real thing. When an novel people are
discussing modern American poetry, they do it in the idiom of William Carlos

06:41.340 --> 06:51.880
Williams, and he knows what he's talking about. He can change the whole texture
and style of what he's saying. And this is a quality that I admire very, very

06:51.880 --> 07:01.340
much indeed. You get bogged down sometimes however in the attempt to change your
style. No, it's just not natural. Not particularly. I guess it's, I have a good

07:01.340 --> 07:11.400
ear. And I'm more interested in people than in anything else. And I listen to
people. And I report either what it is they say or what it is I wish they had

07:11.400 --> 07:22.800
said. But in the way they say it. And of course eliminating the earth and us and
that you're in a crossing. If you've ever read, and I know you have, of course

07:22.800 --> 07:35.700
in your business, you would have a type transcript of a speech terrible. It's
just awful. You've also been quoted as saying that writing is a way of getting

07:35.700 --> 07:49.120
even with people. Now that sounds very pessimistic, misinsropic. And you're
definitely not that sort of person yourself. What did you mean by that? Well, I

07:49.120 --> 08:00.160
think this is true really of all writers, particularly writers who write, who
take their craft seriously. And yet often unbeknownst to the writer himself, he

08:00.160 --> 08:12.340
is in that sense getting even. Getting even is not necessarily a vengeful thing.
Sometimes it's an attempt to understand why you were hurt. Why did this person

08:12.340 --> 08:22.920
hurt me? Is your puzzle, your bewildered. You write a story and before you know
it there's a character in who has been hurt in the same way. And from the

08:22.920 --> 08:34.020
narrative, even if it's a subplot or a subsidiary line in the story, a reason
for that hurt evolves, you begin to understand better. Why you were hurt and

08:34.020 --> 08:41.480
perhaps you're recognizing that the fact you deserve to be hurt in that
instance. So it isn't particularly a vengeful thing of getting even. It's a

08:41.480 --> 08:50.360
question of understanding your fellow human beings. I assume that you've
developed some fairly strong opinions, beliefs over the years, whether it be in

08:50.360 --> 09:04.120
the area of society or politics or whatever. Do you consciously utilize these
beliefs in your stories attempt to grind a certain ax? Let's say. I think rather

09:04.120 --> 09:13.260
than trying to persuade anybody else to my way of thinking, I continually
attempt to crystallize my own thinking. If there's a flaw in its logic, if

09:13.260 --> 09:22.920
there's a prejudice, if there's an unthought conclusion, it becomes open for
grabs. And one of my characters is a big example.

09:25.220 --> 09:40.860
I expose his bigotry. I mean, I pursue his logic until it becomes ridiculous. Or
I do analogies of people. I remember I wrote a story one time about essentially

09:40.860 --> 09:51.400
about Joseph McCarthy. It was a parallel story. It was cast in the future dealt
with other planets in space, flight, and so on. But I felt very strongly about

09:51.400 --> 10:01.440
that at the time. And I had to figure out what it is that the man was doing. Why
was he doing what he was doing? I aside from him, of course, he was after a

10:01.440 --> 10:10.500
certain amount of power. And there was that within which demanded a lot of
public attention. But those things are basically superficial. Why did he want

10:10.500 --> 10:21.620
public attention? Why did he want power? What was his motivations there? And so
the character was historical Mr. Costello Hero. I went right down to the netty

10:21.620 --> 10:33.700
grid. He finally, why a man does a thing like that. Joe McCarthy and so he was a
very fascinating man. He had two sets of realities. One of them was the one that

10:33.700 --> 10:42.180
stood up in front of the microphones and waived paper in his hands and said, I
hold in my hand 240 names of communist and the state department. And another,

10:42.860 --> 10:57.160
but naive, kind of almost childlike. I remember when episode was writing an
elevator with Richard Rovere, a reporter who did great deal of work on him. And

10:57.160 --> 11:07.760
Dean Acheson, a man he had virtually destroyed stepped into the elevator. And
McCarthy said, Hey, Dean, how you've been? And I'm very friendly way. Acheson's

11:07.760 --> 11:17.660
lives got white, his ears got red. Elevator stopped and he got out. And McCarthy
turned Richard Rovere and said, Hey, what's the matter with him? Has he mad at

11:17.660 --> 11:27.360
me? And that was, I mean, said in real innocence and absolutely innocence,
there's a, there's a part missing in people like that. See, I'm not holding him

11:27.360 --> 11:37.380
up as a devil at all. But it's a very, very fascinating kind of human being.
It's just a story to an accursed me that a great deal of science fiction writing

11:38.360 --> 11:54.200
is is a negativeistic in a way because so many stories deal with utopias and how
they fail, but they aren't real utopias. They are ideal societies. I have

11:54.200 --> 12:03.580
thought of something, not many people seem to have thought about utopias. You
see, let me go back to something like this, the cells in your body are

12:03.580 --> 12:13.340
different. At this moment, they were when you walked into the studio. There's a
perpetual growth and change within you and with anything that's alive. And for

12:13.340 --> 12:23.720
that matter, the planet that we're on, it's started in some coal-lasting gases
and it's going to end in a, a bunch of cinders. And the process between us, too,

12:23.780 --> 12:34.300
has not stopped. We're sitting on an island of granite, a float on a sea or hot
mush on a planet which is in motion around its primary. This sun itself is in

12:34.300 --> 12:44.460
motion in the galaxy. The galaxies are all tunneling around in and amongst each
other, even the space between us in kind of a turmoil. If you're at timescale as

12:44.460 --> 12:55.220
large enough, you can see the whole thing boiling. The only unnatural practice
that I can think of, truly unnaturally practice is to stop for a living thing to

12:55.220 --> 13:07.820
just stop. And yet there is that about human beings which makes them want to
stop. Now we are, where you mentioned utopias, virtually without exception, the

13:07.820 --> 13:17.240
utopia is a static situation. You have your own self-tortive goal for everything
is all neat and all the buildings that build around the lake and all the, they

13:17.240 --> 13:26.480
all have ten stories and, you know, and the people move back and forth and not
in smile each other and love each other a bunch. But there's no more beyond

13:26.480 --> 13:35.580
that. Maybe internal expansion and I can't knock that. I mean, there's people
perhaps are learning more and experiencing more within themselves. Nevertheless,

13:35.860 --> 13:48.640
virtually all utopias are playtop, run on up, have this quality of being
perfected instruments like pyramids, like the Egyptian pyramids, finished with a

13:48.640 --> 13:58.940
single stone on top. Well, life isn't like that. People aren't like that. If I
were to design a utopia, it would be one of dynamic equilibrium rather than

13:58.940 --> 14:08.540
static. It would be the kind of equilibrium that a girl has when it flies. It
has to be in motion in order to remain a lot. All life is like that. There are

14:08.540 --> 14:20.680
tenancy to become pessimistic about the future. Not as long as, as I say, we can
combat this, this, this hunger for stasis that I think is the human being's

14:20.680 --> 14:29.820
greatest disease. He wants it locked in and it's better what you see in the
magazine is diamonds or not forever. They really are not forever. Nothing is

14:29.820 --> 14:39.880
forever in that sense. And if you can recognize that and design your life and
your politics and your morality and a sense of ongoing and evolution and growth

14:39.880 --> 14:48.960
and deeper understanding, but always perpetual movement. Then I think you have
something like a utopian situation, but it's a dynamic utopia you see. And you

14:48.960 --> 15:00.860
know, progress in quotation marks has gotten a bad name at many times in the
past. Most of the people who don't like the way progress is going, I mean, there

15:00.860 --> 15:08.940
was probably a lot of lip polling about coming down out of the trees, they're
out of the caves. It's good enough for my grandfather. It's good enough for you,

15:09.400 --> 15:24.860
kid. Many people, I suppose, they are writers mainly, or all those curious about
the habits of another writer and the possibility of having writing blocks and we

15:24.860 --> 15:35.140
get going and the does he have periods of total letter G and so forth? Do you
have any secrets? I am the world's greatest expert on writers' blocks. I had

15:35.140 --> 15:45.560
once the last for six years, six years. And you know, when you get wives and
children and like that, and the rents do and so on, and your income is writing

15:45.560 --> 15:56.340
and you drive for six years. It's pretty rough. Very rough. I think I've entered
a say I can cure virtually anybody's writers' block. Because it's something that

15:56.340 --> 16:08.760
I haven't evolved myself in very profound. I cannot always cure my own, but I
had a profound insight one time. I had a major breakdown in 1965. I mean, I

16:08.760 --> 16:19.620
really came to be. It was a close thing. Fortunately, I fell into the hands of
somebody who, ideally, he was a surgeon fan. This guy, I swear, he'd read more

16:19.620 --> 16:29.460
surgeon than surgeon, he'd written, he could quote old paragraphs, which is more
than I can do. And he pointed out in that six-year period of the work that I had

16:29.460 --> 16:37.440
done before that. And the work that had done subsequent to that period. Because
I was one of the things that was wrong with me. I was being whaling those six

16:37.440 --> 16:47.040
years, six years as an off-town yet appeal, it's a prize, or make it have a
million bucks. And those six years had gone by and everybody was scarred by it.

16:47.600 --> 16:57.960
And so on. And I was mourning that fact in this the last years, and that there
would never come back. And so on. He pointed out to me that the quality of work

16:57.960 --> 17:05.300
that I had done before that, and what was done afterwards. Not only the quality
of the content, he said what I had done before were essentially entertainment.

17:05.940 --> 17:16.400
And nobody's knocking entertainment. We need them like we need vitamins. But the
stuff that I was doing afterwards was of a totally different assort. He called

17:16.400 --> 17:24.000
them therapy stories, well he was a therapist, and that was his particular bias.
But it's true. Virtually everything in our written sense then has been about

17:24.000 --> 17:32.680
people who were sick and get well, or people who are well and get better, and
whatever they are. Well, obviously you were growing during that time. That's the

17:32.680 --> 17:41.380
point that he made. He said, you are mourning the fact that the work stopped. He
said the work didn't stop. The page has stopped coming out. But he said, that's

17:41.380 --> 17:50.740
a triviality. The work continued. And he said, this is documented by the work
you've done. And that was a huge thing for me to find out. I mean, I'm never

17:50.740 --> 17:59.360
going to get depressed about that again. And if I go through a period where no
page has come out for weeks or even months, I'm not particularly concerned. I

17:59.360 --> 18:09.080
find it when I'm writing, I'm typing in some strange ways all done. And suddenly
I sit down and I write it for 30 hours and I'm typing until I fall a recidelift.

18:09.460 --> 18:22.040
I produced 21,000 word novel out without getting up from a desk. But you know,
in 18 or 20 hours. And it's all done. And oddly enough, the internal structure

18:22.040 --> 18:32.160
of this story, the subsidiary plots, the subsidiary of characters themselves,
they're placing of climax and denuma. And so it's all there. It's all finished.

18:33.420 --> 18:41.360
You're interrupted me in the middle and asked me, how is this going to end? And
in what way I wouldn't be able to tell you. That's a peculiar internal thing. Do

18:41.360 --> 18:51.400
you turn to other kinds of stories as relief let's say from science fiction? Not
as relief, but often another

18:51.400 --> 19:01.960
vehicle will say what I want to say better. And as result, I've written real
minds as every, I have book Western stories. And then I can't anybody else's

19:01.960 --> 19:10.800
Western story, but there was a legitimate Western story. And yeah, I've written
a made great way, well, we're back to the same thing where the addict will say

19:10.800 --> 19:20.140
that this dirt and doesn't write real science fiction. No, essentially, I write
people's dirt. You've worked in scenarios for films, have you know? Yeah, we're

19:20.140 --> 19:28.440
not the West Coast originally, 12 years ago, right, it's an arttrec. And about
six I sold four, an air two, which is pretty well-par. And of course, and those

19:28.440 --> 19:38.020
two have been showcased very well in the mean thing. They were very successful.
They were in Star Trek addicts out there. They were a mock time. For those who

19:38.020 --> 19:47.580
are very familiar with Star Trek, which shows where these are. Yeah, a mock time
was one of them. The other was called Sure Leave. And they've been very

19:47.580 --> 19:58.800
successful. Have you worked on full length feature films? Not specifically, no.
One of my stories killed those, which is, I think one of the best stories I ever

19:58.800 --> 20:07.400
wrote. I mentioned, I'd write up for six years. In the middle of that six-year
period, for nine days, I could write, and I wrote killed those, and it's right

20:07.400 --> 20:18.280
first draft exactly where you read it all the way through. And then it shot down
again. And it was put by universal pictures. And they made a movie of the week

20:18.280 --> 20:28.820
out of it. And it is a dog. It is awful. I mean, really. You can't fault the D9,
here's the caterpillar, D9, which is marvelous machine. I'm going to love it

20:28.820 --> 20:37.520
with those big machines for years anyhow. I'm still a class I hear you're
equipment opportunity. As a person who deals with the imagination, imaginative

20:37.520 --> 20:53.480
things, do you think that this emphasis on the visual interpreting all these
stories through pictures is detrimental to writing of science fiction? It's hard

20:53.480 --> 21:04.140
to say, as a man called Byron Price in New York, who is getting out a whole line
of what they call graphics, graphics novels, which are as much pictures as they

21:04.140 --> 21:13.540
are as they are prose. And they have something to be said for them. But I think
it's essentially a super comic book, that's right. But it's another kind of

21:13.540 --> 21:23.520
fiction. I mean, just as there are kinds of music, there's chamber music,
there's symphonic music, and there's rock in this country. And each conveys to

21:23.520 --> 21:34.660
its audience, what its audience really wants. And so I don't know, I am afraid
that people are going to start reading, which is an interesting thing. You know,

21:34.720 --> 21:43.460
back in the 15th and 16th century, if a guy worked on shoes, he put a big boot
up over his door. And if a guy is sold horses, he put a big horse up over his

21:43.460 --> 21:51.620
door. Because people couldn't read. We know we're getting back to that. It's not
only watching television all the time, but the international science, and now

21:51.620 --> 21:59.560
you've got a sign for the ladies' room and you got a sign for a telephone, and
you've got a sign for their baggage, pick up and so on. All these little picture

21:59.560 --> 22:10.640
graphs. And pretty soon, we're just going to be watching the tube and looking at
pictures grass, and what price really find finished prose. It's quite of the

22:10.640 --> 22:23.060
fact that the gimmickry is superior. Do you think we've gone downhill from Star
Trek to Battle Star Galactic? Battle Star Galactic has suffered primarily from

22:23.060 --> 22:37.980
the ripoff. I mean, they take things that are guaranteed successes and redo them
in the Galactic format. For example, Jane and I saw Shane on Battle Star

22:37.980 --> 22:40.800
Galactic virtually down the line.

22:43.620 --> 22:52.220
And this is what they do. Whatever has been successful, and they put it in the
science, fiction, format, and it works. Star Trek was its own highly original

22:52.220 --> 23:06.760
thing. The success of Star Trek, the people tried to imitate it and fail. The
main reason they fail is that Star Trek was started and promoted and still is by

23:06.760 --> 23:19.040
a man who had ideals. He really did. Gene Roddenberry believes in such things as
patriotism in American, democratic ideal, and the equality of the sexists, and

23:19.040 --> 23:29.660
the equality of the races. He believes in these things very deeply, his own
personality, and in every episode of Star Trek, he exploited and expressed these

23:29.660 --> 23:39.900
beliefs. And that's really what we each people. It wasn't so much Captain Kirk
and Mr. Spock's point of view, it was the underlying faith that had his own

23:39.900 --> 23:50.080
idea. A lot of people who say that that's corny and a ho-hom and array, that's
wrap ourselves in the American flag. It isn't that it goes very much, even that.

23:50.500 --> 23:59.600
People really do want something to believe in. Space 1999 and even Galactic,
don't really seem to give much of a damn about anything except getting this show

23:59.600 --> 24:12.460
on the year next season. But Gene Roddenberry believed very profoundly in these
things using Star Trek to express them from the visual to other art forms. I

24:12.460 --> 24:24.900
know you are an appreciator of music. Do you sometimes feel that they're wish
that you were a composer rather than a writer, could you express some of your

24:24.900 --> 24:31.820
ideas better in some other form? Either as a composer or an artist? There are
things that you can say in music that you can't say in words.

24:34.780 --> 24:46.500
I am certainly thought of John Carl Mennotti who wrote the medium. As somebody
wrote him once as a triple threat artist, he was a director and it was a

24:46.500 --> 24:56.460
composer and he was a libretist. And he said, oh no, not triple. Double. And
interviewer said, when you mean double, he said, well, yes, I'm a director, but

24:56.460 --> 25:07.020
he said as far as the rest of it, the words come to me in music. To him they
were all the same thing. It's a very interesting way of expressing it. But

25:07.020 --> 25:19.120
sometimes music alone, there's a guitar a2d by Fernando Sour, which someday I'm
going to write lyrics too, but it just takes me apart and listen to. I think the

25:19.120 --> 25:31.180
greatest piece of music ever composed is the Pasecagli and few you can see mine
by Bach. It's architecture in such an extraordinary way. One's up with

25:31.180 --> 25:41.180
establishes a 15 note theme and simply repeat it over and over again, but we're
rephrasing it and throwing it to various parts of the orchestra, whether he

25:41.180 --> 25:51.180
composed it with four and orchestra or not at the beside point. And winding up
with a monumental discord, everything is there. He's just a great crashing 115

25:51.180 --> 26:00.780
piece of chord that leans over sideways about to fall over. Then he backs off
and it gives it to your in-seat major, having written in-seemime at the whole

26:00.780 --> 26:11.180
time. And you just go away feeling good and I don't know how you do that in
prose. I really don't. You have a new collection of stories that's just out.

26:11.680 --> 26:22.180
Yeah, it's called Vision's Invisionaries. It's from down. It's the first of five
works that Dell is getting out within the next year, 18 months. Are both of

26:22.180 --> 26:29.520
these short story collections? No, two of them are novels. Two of them are the
other three or or you find it more difficult to write a full length work than a

26:29.520 --> 26:42.880
short story. It depends on the idea that's pushing you. Often you'll start to
write a short story and expands itself into a novel that or even into a novel.

26:43.300 --> 26:51.960
That's interesting how that happens to. Often you get a very powerful idea and
it plunges you right into it and you keep working it and working it until it's

26:51.960 --> 27:00.140
done. You find that it needs to be cut and what you cut is the original idea
that started the whole thing because it's taking the bitnits teeth and run off

27:00.140 --> 27:08.340
in another direction. The suggestion has been delightful talking with you. Thank
you so much for joining us. Thank you. And it's been a pleasure to talk to you.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.880
You have some fine questions. You really do. Thank you.
