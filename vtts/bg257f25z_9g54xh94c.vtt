00:06.848 --> 00:29.901
[Tom Turbiville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.921 --> 00:30.983
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.071
[Tom Turbiville]: You won't find a prouder Aggie than Joe Brewster.

00:34.391 --> 00:35.953
[Tom Turbiville]: Being an Aggie is in his blood.

00:36.134 --> 00:41.040
[Tom Turbiville]: His father, his grandfather, his great uncle, his uncle, his sons, all fellow Aggies.

00:41.561 --> 00:46.267
[Tom Turbiville]: And like his father, Colonel Olin Finley Brewster, Joe Brewster served his country in combat.

00:46.928 --> 00:50.493
[Tom Turbiville]: Olin Brewster, a decorated soldier of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.

00:50.894 --> 00:54.979
[Tom Turbiville]: Joe Brewster, a ground infantry fighter in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia.

00:55.347 --> 00:59.934
[Tom Turbiville]: It's our pleasure to have Lieutenant Joe Brewster as our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

01:00.014 --> 01:01.236
[Tom Turbiville]: Joe, it's great to have you here.

01:01.316 --> 01:05.743
[Tom Turbiville]: First, I want you to talk about Olin Finley Brewster, your dad.

01:05.763 --> 01:12.173
[Tom Turbiville]: I know you told me one time that there was probably not many officers that were more written about in World War II than Olin Brewster.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.856
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about your dad and what he did.

01:13.876 --> 01:16.039
[Joe Brewster]: Well, my dad was a major

01:16.627 --> 01:21.217
[Joe Brewster]: His promise came about in the Battle of the Bulge.

01:21.517 --> 01:29.674
[Joe Brewster]: Pretty much the Germans tried their counteroffensive in December of 1944, trying to split the American Allied Forces to get to Antwerp.

01:30.262 --> 01:35.629
[Joe Brewster]: And for their success, they had to go through several major road intersections.

01:35.649 --> 01:43.540
[Joe Brewster]: And my dad was responsible for an area south of Antwerp, an area called Parker's Crossroads.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.905
[Joe Brewster]: And they held this intersection for two or three days, keeping the German divisions back.

01:47.925 --> 01:52.892
[Joe Brewster]: But being right in the middle of a core boundary, one core unit pulled back to reset their lines.

01:52.912 --> 01:56.036
[Joe Brewster]: The other core unit did not, which my dad was still left forward.

01:56.597 --> 01:59.661
[Joe Brewster]: And the only reason he had to pull out was the Germans got in and around behind him.

02:00.097 --> 02:03.563
[Joe Brewster]: So he was given the orders to pull back the best way he could.

02:04.184 --> 02:06.107
[Joe Brewster]: Pulling forward, he lost several tanks.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.270
[Joe Brewster]: Pulling backwards, he lost several tanks.

02:08.291 --> 02:15.402
[Joe Brewster]: And he realized at that point in time that he wasn't going to be able to get his men out successfully unless they went ahead and destroyed the rest of their vehicles.

02:16.244 --> 02:21.953
[Joe Brewster]: And he was able to march all his men out on Christmas Eve there in December 1944.

02:22.085 --> 02:24.710
[Tom Turbiville]: I know it's a story that you're very proud of, and you're very proud of him.

02:24.730 --> 02:31.903
[Tom Turbiville]: I know you lost him not too many years ago, but he was a person who you were very interested in his service and he in yours.

02:32.584 --> 02:35.890
[Joe Brewster]: Well, he brought us kids up understanding two things.

02:36.070 --> 02:37.753
[Joe Brewster]: Number one, we were going to be Aggies.

02:39.276 --> 02:41.861
[Joe Brewster]: My brother and I ended up being third-generation Aggies, come to A&M.

02:42.382 --> 02:44.886
[Joe Brewster]: And he also told us that we had an obligation to our country.

02:45.254 --> 02:46.255
[Joe Brewster]: and we would be soldiers.

02:46.976 --> 02:53.665
[Joe Brewster]: And my brother just retired, full colonel, stationed down at Fort Sam down in Santon.

02:53.765 --> 02:56.809
[Joe Brewster]: My military career didn't last as long as my dad's and my brother's.

02:56.829 --> 03:08.043
[Joe Brewster]: After spending a couple years in the active army and then a couple years, two or three years in inactive reserves, my service came to an end.

03:08.123 --> 03:13.270
[Joe Brewster]: Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, but my dad pretty much set the pattern which us boys had to follow.

03:13.672 --> 03:18.078
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's talk about the path that brought you not only to A&M, but then into the service.

03:18.118 --> 03:21.703
[Tom Turbiville]: It was a little bit unusual back in the mid-60s when you came to A&M.

03:22.084 --> 03:24.647
[Tom Turbiville]: There was a brand new program then that still exists today.

03:24.667 --> 03:28.973
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about sort of the program that sent you through and to the military at A&M.

03:28.993 --> 03:30.836
[Joe Brewster]: Well, my brother was already here at A&M.

03:31.016 --> 03:32.218
[Joe Brewster]: He ended up being class of 66.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.987
[Joe Brewster]: And it was my turn to come to A&M, but my freshman year, I didn't quite have the monies to...

03:39.457 --> 03:42.621
[Joe Brewster]: come to the fine university here on the Brazos.

03:42.642 --> 03:45.706
[Joe Brewster]: So I ended up spending a couple years at Temple Junior College over in Temple.

03:47.088 --> 03:57.803
[Joe Brewster]: At that time, I thought my dream of getting into core here at A&M had come to an end, but A&M started this new program called a two-year program where you could go to a summer camp between your sophomore and junior year in college.

03:58.357 --> 04:03.626
[Joe Brewster]: And then you come in as a junior in the Corps, but naturally with freshman privileges.

04:03.646 --> 04:07.633
[Joe Brewster]: And then you go to a second summer camp between your junior and senior year.

04:07.653 --> 04:14.965
[Joe Brewster]: And so because of this, it enabled me to go ahead and get my commission at Texas A&M University in a two-year time frame instead of a four-year time frame.

04:15.046 --> 04:15.967
[Tom Turbiville]: Indeed.

04:15.987 --> 04:20.435
[Tom Turbiville]: And you were a distinguished military student here at Texas A&M, is that right?

04:20.895 --> 04:21.797
[Joe Brewster]: Yes, sir, that's correct.

04:21.817 --> 04:27.806
[Joe Brewster]: And I believe what system in that is, like I say, being a third generation Aggie, I knew a lot about A&M.

04:28.047 --> 04:29.068
[Joe Brewster]: I knew a lot about the Corps.

04:29.589 --> 04:31.452
[Joe Brewster]: I knew what was expected of me.

04:31.634 --> 04:37.262
[Joe Brewster]: Also, my dad being in the military, I had gone out to Fort Hood with him on numerous occasions as a kid, so I understood the military ways.

04:37.963 --> 04:48.559
[Joe Brewster]: The first camp I went to between my sophomore and junior year taught me basic military, not only to be able to march, be able to fire a weapon.

04:49.440 --> 04:54.087
[Joe Brewster]: I did things prior to coming into my junior year that a lot of the juniors in the Corps had not got to do yet.

04:54.888 --> 05:01.017
[Joe Brewster]: So when it came time to teach in dismounted drill and doing things with weapons, I was often used as an instructor.

05:01.385 --> 05:10.942
[Joe Brewster]: Then between my junior and senior year, I excelled at 4C Oklahoma and so that gave me an opportunity to be nominated for and receive this DMS and later DMG.

05:11.282 --> 05:17.453
[Tom Turbiville]: It also gave you the opportunity to choose your specialty in the Army or at least narrow it down and I know you said you

05:17.838 --> 05:21.503
[Tom Turbiville]: You put down infantry, armored, and artillery, and you got infantry.

05:21.543 --> 05:21.944
[Tom Turbiville]: Is that right?

05:22.144 --> 05:28.654
[Joe Brewster]: Well, back then, you were required to put one combat branch, which would have been armored or infantry, artillery.

05:29.235 --> 05:32.319
[Joe Brewster]: Then you put down two service branches, quartermaster, transportation.

05:33.041 --> 05:39.210
[Joe Brewster]: I was a little on the gung-ho side back then, so I wanted to go combat, so I put them down infantry, armored, and artillery.

05:39.230 --> 05:44.858
[Joe Brewster]: Broke my dad's heart because he was armored, but I knew that I wanted to go infantry because Vietnam was going at the time.

05:45.158 --> 05:49.863
[Joe Brewster]: And I couldn't see fighting in the jungles of Vietnam sitting in a half track or a tank.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.365
[Joe Brewster]: I thought my chances were a lot better as an infantryman.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.566
[Joe Brewster]: And so that's the way I selected.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.848
[Joe Brewster]: And the Army, based on that great wisdom, gave it to me.

05:56.009 --> 05:56.869
[Tom Turbiville]: You went to Ranger School.

05:56.889 --> 05:57.410
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that.

05:57.730 --> 05:58.691
[Joe Brewster]: Oh, I love Ranger School.

05:58.711 --> 06:05.538
[Joe Brewster]: I knew that when I came through infantry officer basic at Fort Benning that, again, my path was towards Vietnam.

06:05.558 --> 06:10.683
[Joe Brewster]: And I felt like the best insurance policy to have at the time is to take some of the better schools that the Army was offering.

06:11.183 --> 06:13.005
[Joe Brewster]: I did the airborne jump school.

06:13.238 --> 06:19.645
[Joe Brewster]: It was great for just getting out and running every morning and jumping out of an airplane, but I couldn't see its full usefulness in Vietnam.

06:20.125 --> 06:32.619
[Joe Brewster]: But the ranger school taught small unit tactics, and it taught you what it was like to fight in jungle, where you spent two weeks in Dahloneca, Georgia doing mountain warfare, but then they took us down to Elgin Air Force Base, the jungles down in Florida.

06:33.319 --> 06:41.288
[Joe Brewster]: And we spent two and a half weeks of maneuvering down there, and that gave me a really good experience of what I could expect when I got to Vietnam.

06:41.369 --> 06:46.996
[Tom Turbiville]: You went to Fort Riley, Kansas for three months, I guess, for your final training before you went in country.

06:47.017 --> 06:50.641
[Tom Turbiville]: 1970, I guess this was toward the latter years, actually, of the war.

06:50.661 --> 06:57.450
[Tom Turbiville]: 1970, first week or first or second week of January, you were in country and you served for 11 months.

06:57.531 --> 06:59.493
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about when you first went there.

06:59.513 --> 07:05.221
[Tom Turbiville]: And I'm going to let you just sort of go ahead and sort of talk about your 11 months in service in Vietnam.

07:05.241 --> 07:06.162
[Tom Turbiville]: I know you talk about

07:06.513 --> 07:09.137
[Tom Turbiville]: that you had a guardian angel on you many times.

07:09.177 --> 07:12.642
[Tom Turbiville]: So just go with it and talk about your service in Nam.

07:12.883 --> 07:21.296
[Joe Brewster]: Well, one thing that I found out real quickly in Vietnam is it doesn't matter how good you are, a lot of it determines on how lucky you can also be.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.299
[Joe Brewster]: And I often refer to it as being the guardian angel.

07:23.699 --> 07:30.730
[Joe Brewster]: My first day out in the field, I was flown out with another lieutenant who was also being assigned to the same battalion I was being assigned to.

07:30.770 --> 07:35.237
[Joe Brewster]: And also in a helicopter was a full colonel who happened to also be a Presbyterian minister.

07:35.217 --> 07:38.848
[Joe Brewster]: So I felt like if you had to go into combat, that was probably the best person in the world to go in with.

07:39.449 --> 07:47.112
[Joe Brewster]: As I exited the helicopter at my first forward base, there was an officer waiting for me out on the pad, and I thought that was my welcome committee.

07:47.132 --> 07:49.699
[Joe Brewster]: Well, I found out that was the lieutenant whose place I was taking.

07:50.253 --> 08:03.113
[Joe Brewster]: I thought and was understanding that I would work with him up to a week to get a better grasp of what to expect of my troops and my platoon as well as the area of operation we'd be working in.

08:03.614 --> 08:10.585
[Joe Brewster]: Well, he let me know immediately as he was boarding the helicopter that he thought his luck had run out and he was going back to the rear base and I was on my own.

08:11.747 --> 08:13.189
[Joe Brewster]: My dad had always told me that

08:13.523 --> 08:14.724
[Joe Brewster]: look to your NCOs.

08:15.345 --> 08:25.614
[Joe Brewster]: They are the backbone of the Army, and thank goodness my platoon had a crusty old NCO, E7, and he took me under his wing and he said, you know, Lieutenant, if you'll listen to me, I can get you through this.

08:25.634 --> 08:32.780
[Joe Brewster]: And so for the first two or three weeks, I pretty much listened to him, and I felt like a lot of my success came from him.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.322
[Joe Brewster]: But I was thrown into it almost immediately.

08:35.422 --> 08:42.889
[Joe Brewster]: After meeting my company commander and was introduced to my platoon and met a lot of the platoon members, we were out the second night that I was in country.

08:42.869 --> 08:49.941
[Joe Brewster]: and we had river boats that the Navy provided us to take us up, and we were forming an umbrella protection for Saigon.

08:50.361 --> 09:05.907
[Joe Brewster]: We were trying to interdict both forces as well as supplies coming in from Cambodia by either water routes or trail, jungle trails, and so we were supposed to interdict them by setting up ambushes at night and preventing them from moving through the area freely.

09:06.359 --> 09:17.794
[Joe Brewster]: My first night, we were set up, and normally you set up either a linear ambush with rear security or an L-shaped ambush with rear security, depending on the terrain and what you're trying to ambush, a trail or a waterway.

09:17.814 --> 09:27.627
[Joe Brewster]: As we got in late, though, we did not have an opportunity to check out the terrain, so we just formed a wagon-wheel type of ambush, figuring any direction, 360, we'd be ready for it.

09:28.327 --> 09:34.155
[Joe Brewster]: After about an hour on the ground, hour and a half on the ground, I was tapped by one of the members of my...

09:34.135 --> 09:36.839
[Joe Brewster]: unit saying, Lieutenant, they're out there.

09:36.859 --> 09:37.841
[Joe Brewster]: And I said, who's out there?

09:38.281 --> 09:44.090
[Joe Brewster]: He informed me that it sounded like VC or MVA had found our position and he suggested we go on full alert.

09:44.831 --> 09:52.583
[Joe Brewster]: About that time, RTO also punched me and said, Lieutenant, the Toon Sergeant on the other side of the ambush says that he has movement out in front of him.

09:53.069 --> 09:56.420
[Joe Brewster]: So I called my NCL and said, hey, this is my first night out here.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.563
[Joe Brewster]: What do you recommend?

09:57.583 --> 10:06.792
[Joe Brewster]: He said, well, go to a full mad minute, which meant that everybody in our ambush would fire immediately at the same time for one full minute, which we did.

10:07.109 --> 10:10.053
[Joe Brewster]: And sure enough, the NVAVC were out in front of us.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.515
[Joe Brewster]: We received return fire.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.918
[Joe Brewster]: We suffered four or five casualties at that time.

10:14.779 --> 10:18.824
[Joe Brewster]: We ourselves only found a few blood trails of the NVAVC.

10:19.445 --> 10:22.770
[Joe Brewster]: It had no KIA that we could count for them.

10:22.790 --> 10:29.598
[Joe Brewster]: Since it was so late at night, since we could not move to another position successfully and safely, we were extracted that night.

10:30.179 --> 10:33.083
[Joe Brewster]: And then we continued to do the same routine over the next couple of weeks.

10:33.907 --> 10:34.708
[Tom Turbiville]: The mad minute.

10:35.469 --> 10:39.695
[Tom Turbiville]: This is your first really full night in command of the platoon.

10:40.577 --> 10:42.860
[Tom Turbiville]: And how did you feel?

10:42.880 --> 10:49.409
[Tom Turbiville]: I mean, it must have been rather mind boggling for you to realize where you were and that this was the real thing.

10:49.830 --> 10:58.783
[Joe Brewster]: It's amazing how with all the training that I had done, both through infantry officer basic, ranger and airborne, that immediately when the first rounds were fired,

10:59.101 --> 11:02.345
[Joe Brewster]: that I wasn't even aware of what I was doing.

11:02.365 --> 11:04.027
[Joe Brewster]: There was a mechanism that kicked in.

11:04.548 --> 11:08.893
[Joe Brewster]: My infantry platoon leader just said, quote, this is how it's done.

11:08.913 --> 11:10.736
[Joe Brewster]: You have studied it over and over again.

11:11.396 --> 11:12.318
[Joe Brewster]: Follow your intuition.

11:13.279 --> 11:15.542
[Joe Brewster]: Your training will not take you the wrong direction.

11:16.122 --> 11:25.254
[Joe Brewster]: And I noticed that throughout my nine or ten months that I was out in the field, that every time a situation occurred, I'd fall back on that training, and the training was always successful.

11:25.775 --> 11:26.155
[Joe Brewster]: It worked.

11:27.265 --> 11:40.459
[Tom Turbiville]: You talked to me earlier about that these troops in Vietnam, sometimes that they had to endure, for lack of a better word, several different leaders during a year because the officers were moved in and moved out of Vietnam.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.800
[Tom Turbiville]: They might get three or four.

11:41.900 --> 11:47.546
[Tom Turbiville]: So you were placed in that situation to where you were a brand new leader for troops that had been there maybe a couple of tours.

11:47.886 --> 11:53.492
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that and what that was like and the help that you got sort of being placed in that situation.

11:53.658 --> 12:01.442
[Joe Brewster]: Well, it seemed that part of being in Vietnam was to stop communism, but it was also a training base for our young soldiers.

12:02.264 --> 12:07.701
[Joe Brewster]: The platoon leaders, the first and second lieutenants, as well as the captains, was in a testing area.

12:08.002 --> 12:11.945
[Joe Brewster]: They all, or a majority of them, were planning on making the Army, regular Army.

12:12.626 --> 12:17.550
[Joe Brewster]: And they were all preparing for that big war that at some time in the future we thought we might have with either China or Russia.

12:18.071 --> 12:22.615
[Joe Brewster]: So they were trying to give as many young officers a chance to be in command.

12:23.335 --> 12:27.259
[Joe Brewster]: So when I got in country, most of the officers were being rotated out in three or four months.

12:27.759 --> 12:31.242
[Joe Brewster]: But Nixon in 1970 said, hey, we're going to start withdrawing troops.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.724
[Joe Brewster]: So fewer and fewer troops were going.

12:32.744 --> 12:37.688
[Joe Brewster]: So instead of me spending a normal three or four months in line, I ended up spending nine.

12:38.107 --> 12:42.801
[Joe Brewster]: The problem with this rotation and everything is that you have an entry between 40 or 45 men.

12:43.186 --> 12:51.820
[Joe Brewster]: You have an officer who comes in there and only spends three months, and he may be a West Point graduate, and that particular officer has his own way of doing things.

12:52.361 --> 13:01.416
[Joe Brewster]: After three months, he would be moved to the rear or to another position, and you might get an officer coming in who graduated from Arkansas ROTC or Texas A&M University.

13:01.836 --> 13:09.008
[Joe Brewster]: Each one wanted to do it their way, and each time the platoon had to suffer through this gradual learning again.

13:09.410 --> 13:20.125
[Joe Brewster]: Well, the only common base we had was the NCOs, in that if they had been in the military long enough, and if you normally had an E-6, E-7, they'd been in the military for probably five to ten years.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.748
[Joe Brewster]: So they were the constant that went with each platoon.

13:22.789 --> 13:28.717
[Joe Brewster]: They would take the lieutenant aside and say, that will work if you're back stateside, it's not going to work here, lieutenant.

13:29.177 --> 13:31.080
[Joe Brewster]: And if you had a good lieutenant, he would listen to them.

13:31.617 --> 13:39.251
[Joe Brewster]: And pretty much that's how we handled our situation for the first two months, one month, until I got my feet on the ground.

13:39.271 --> 13:41.275
[Joe Brewster]: And after that, the constant was me.

13:42.096 --> 13:46.705
[Joe Brewster]: And being allowed to stay with my unit for up to eight or nine months, it benefited our unit.

13:46.725 --> 13:50.412
[Joe Brewster]: We were more cohesive during the nine, ten months that I was in the field.

13:50.432 --> 13:53.878
[Joe Brewster]: A lot of the casualties that occurred in Vietnam occurred from booby traps.

13:54.415 --> 14:01.012
[Joe Brewster]: We got out in the field and we moved through jungles, we moved through water areas, we moved through Mitchelon rubber plantation.

14:01.554 --> 14:03.017
[Joe Brewster]: One thing we did, we moved with stealth.

14:03.118 --> 14:05.845
[Joe Brewster]: We moved, we didn't go anywhere unless we took our time.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.517
[Joe Brewster]: We paid attention to the environment around us.

14:10.497 --> 14:13.520
[Joe Brewster]: We would move, we would stop, we would listen, we would smell.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.242
[Joe Brewster]: Then we'd move and do the same thing over and over again every 15 minutes.

14:16.903 --> 14:25.170
[Joe Brewster]: And if you let your troops know what you were going to do that day, a lot of the units failed to tell the private or the point man, hey, this is our objective for the day.

14:25.190 --> 14:30.815
[Joe Brewster]: Most of them just said go in that direction for about 2,000 to 3,000 meters, and then we're going to ambush tonight.

14:31.416 --> 14:35.099
[Joe Brewster]: I would try to make sure that down to my lowest man, they knew what we were going to do that day.

14:35.119 --> 14:37.802
[Joe Brewster]: They felt like we were part of the decision-making.

14:37.822 --> 14:40.504
[Joe Brewster]: And so that if, in fact, we hit anything along our way,

14:40.484 --> 14:43.788
[Joe Brewster]: from point A to point B, they would say it was expected.

14:44.149 --> 14:50.417
[Joe Brewster]: I was told by the lieutenant that this is what to expect and they were more educated when it came to grasping the situation.

14:50.737 --> 14:52.519
[Tom Turbiville]: Lieutenant Brewster, you brought some pictures.

14:52.620 --> 15:00.410
[Tom Turbiville]: I know you have a lot of photographs from your time in Vietnam and we are going to show some of them here as a matter of fact that Lieutenant Brewster has.

15:00.970 --> 15:02.152
[Tom Turbiville]: Go ahead and talk about the picture.

15:02.172 --> 15:03.133
[Tom Turbiville]: What are we looking at there?

15:03.485 --> 15:06.169
[Joe Brewster]: Well, this is a road from Conten.

15:06.189 --> 15:07.311
[Tom Turbiville]: That's you on the right, by the way.

15:07.331 --> 15:08.113
[Joe Brewster]: That is me on the far right.

15:08.774 --> 15:15.184
[Joe Brewster]: And we are pulling a road security for trucks coming from Conten over to the Cambodian border.

15:16.166 --> 15:20.633
[Joe Brewster]: And our job was to parallel this road and make sure the NVC...

15:20.613 --> 15:26.899
[Joe Brewster]: NVC or the NVA and the Viet Cong were not setting up ambushes or putting mines out in the road.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.340
[Joe Brewster]: So this is sort of a rest break.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.682
[Joe Brewster]: We had probably been moving since 5 in the morning.

15:31.363 --> 15:34.986
[Joe Brewster]: We stopped probably getting ready to take a lunch break and then move on down the road.

15:35.006 --> 15:45.936
[Joe Brewster]: There'd probably be another unit probably a half mile behind us doing the same thing to keep the NVA and VC from coming in behind my unit and planting mines before the trucks started bringing in their supplies to the fire support base.

15:46.297 --> 15:48.659
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on to the next one.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.080
[Tom Turbiville]: Show a little muscle there.

15:50.060 --> 15:54.126
[Joe Brewster]: There's a little muscle here, but this is the we're having an officer's meeting here.

15:54.366 --> 16:00.536
[Joe Brewster]: We're getting ready to head out on the choppers out into the jungle.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.220
[Joe Brewster]: And those are the lieutenants.

16:03.240 --> 16:06.685
[Joe Brewster]: And our company commander had just given us our operation orders.

16:06.665 --> 16:24.371
[Joe Brewster]: And typically us officers would, after the company commander left, us lieutenants would sort of put our heads together, and we would discuss the operation, and if anybody had any great ideas or expectations of what we should know, the most experienced officer would say, look, we've been in this area before, we're going back to it again, and this is what you need to know about it.

16:25.012 --> 16:28.137
[Joe Brewster]: And so we're just discussing what we're getting ready to do for the next two or three days.

16:28.157 --> 16:29.259
[Tom Turbiville]: Lieutenant Brewster there in the middle.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.442
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's move on to the next photograph.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.967
[Tom Turbiville]: Now you're having some fun with some of the kids there in Vietnam.

16:34.947 --> 16:41.497
[Joe Brewster]: You know, we were pretty much day in, day out in the jungles working ambushes.

16:41.517 --> 16:45.683
[Joe Brewster]: But every once in a while, we had the enjoyment of getting to pull protection for a village.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.109
[Joe Brewster]: And we enjoyed working with the village people, and they enjoyed us.

16:50.530 --> 16:55.858
[Joe Brewster]: Typically, we would have in our company of three platoons, we'd have two platoons pulling an umbrella

16:55.838 --> 17:03.791
[Joe Brewster]: security on the outside of the village and one of the platoons would stay inside the village and help maybe build buildings, build desks for the small kids.

17:04.152 --> 17:14.529
[Joe Brewster]: We provided entertainment for them and here we're just taking the opportunity to let the kids know that we were friendly, we were easy going, we were not big giants who were going to hurt them.

17:14.549 --> 17:18.696
[Joe Brewster]: And so we're doing a game of splits here and the kids found it very entertaining.

17:18.716 --> 17:21.981
[Tom Turbiville]: That's you in the back there doing the major splits there.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.570
[Joe Brewster]: Here's a couple of other lieutenants.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.032
[Joe Brewster]: I was third platoon leader.

17:26.092 --> 17:30.177
[Joe Brewster]: The gentleman in the middle was second platoon, and the gentleman on the far left was first platoon.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.961
[Joe Brewster]: In Cambodia, both of them got shot.

17:33.902 --> 17:34.923
[Joe Brewster]: Both survived.

17:34.984 --> 17:37.807
[Joe Brewster]: The one in the middle came back for a second time.

17:38.348 --> 17:44.416
[Joe Brewster]: His injuries weren't so bad, but then about a month and a half later, two months later, he also got hit a second time.

17:44.656 --> 17:48.701
[Joe Brewster]: I was the fortunate one who managed to always stay out of harm's way.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.185
[Joe Brewster]: That's that Gordon Angel I said was on my shoulder.

17:51.245 --> 17:52.947
[Joe Brewster]: I was in the same mix as they were.

17:52.927 --> 17:58.192
[Joe Brewster]: When we went into Cambodia, there was three-line platoon officers.

17:58.212 --> 18:02.657
[Joe Brewster]: We had a forward observer and a commander, and of those officers, I was the only one who came back and escaped.

18:03.818 --> 18:08.322
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on to the next photograph, another photograph of you.

18:08.623 --> 18:10.464
[Joe Brewster]: That is a rice paddy during the summertime.

18:10.504 --> 18:13.888
[Joe Brewster]: It's dried up, so they apparently don't have rice in there right now growing.

18:13.928 --> 18:18.192
[Joe Brewster]: During the wet seasons, monsoons, that would be filled up with water probably up to your ankle.

18:18.610 --> 18:24.880
[Joe Brewster]: And typically, even during wet or dry time of season, you never walk on the berms or the high ground you see in the background.

18:25.501 --> 18:28.065
[Joe Brewster]: That's where the NVA or VC would set their booby traps.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.069
[Joe Brewster]: We would walk through the water or through the flat part there.

18:31.490 --> 18:37.740
[Joe Brewster]: Now, what we're doing here is that we're probably getting ready to go in after spending a week or two out pulling ambushes.

18:38.481 --> 18:41.125
[Joe Brewster]: And we always like to make sure that we shoot through our old

18:41.105 --> 18:46.254
[Joe Brewster]: shells, our old weaponry, cleaning out your weapons.

18:46.294 --> 18:53.527
[Joe Brewster]: You don't want to take back bullets that maybe got rusted or maybe got jammed or hit around while you were going through the jungle getting off helicopters.

18:53.547 --> 18:58.455
[Joe Brewster]: So we would pretty much clean our weapons and then resupply ourselves when we got back to the base camp.

18:58.475 --> 19:02.202
[Joe Brewster]: And actually we wouldn't use all our ammunition at this point because you never know on the way back

19:02.182 --> 19:04.565
[Joe Brewster]: to your base camp, you might get shot down.

19:05.025 --> 19:07.488
[Joe Brewster]: But we would shoot maybe half our load here to clear our weapon.

19:07.708 --> 19:09.470
[Joe Brewster]: Plus, we'd cross train.

19:09.651 --> 19:11.473
[Joe Brewster]: I would be shooting M79, getting used to it.

19:11.533 --> 19:14.897
[Joe Brewster]: Another guy would move over from his rifle over to the machine gun.

19:15.217 --> 19:18.981
[Joe Brewster]: So we'd cross train so that if one person went down, somebody else could also use that weapon.

19:19.002 --> 19:21.284
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on to the next one.

19:21.304 --> 19:25.489
[Tom Turbiville]: Now, this was actually back in the States during training in Colorado, right?

19:25.469 --> 19:26.611
[Tom Turbiville]: I just thought it was a great picture.

19:26.711 --> 19:30.115
[Joe Brewster]: Well, it is, and you can tell that was not Vietnam, because look at the starched uniform.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.379
[Joe Brewster]: You would not be wearing that over in the jungles of Vietnam.

19:34.221 --> 19:46.617
[Joe Brewster]: When I came out after two years of the Army, I went into the reserves, and I didn't have to go active reserve because I had spent time in Vietnam, so I was under the title of inactive reserve, which meant that if I was needed,

19:46.799 --> 19:50.283
[Joe Brewster]: at some summer camp for two weeks, I could be called up.

19:50.303 --> 19:55.249
[Joe Brewster]: Well, this was a mech unit that came in out of Nebraska who did their train over at Fort Carson, Colorado.

19:55.269 --> 19:56.350
[Joe Brewster]: So they called me up to come in.

19:56.370 --> 20:01.736
[Joe Brewster]: They were a platoon leader and they had me go up there and spend two weeks.

20:02.497 --> 20:04.039
[Joe Brewster]: And so I was working with a mech unit.

20:04.059 --> 20:05.301
[Joe Brewster]: That's an armored personnel carrier.

20:06.202 --> 20:09.145
[Joe Brewster]: And what you do, it's a little bit different than doing infantry.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.832
[Joe Brewster]: In infantry, you're normally very close together when you're moving through jungles.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.736
[Joe Brewster]: You space out a little bit more in the open area.

20:15.036 --> 20:25.155
[Joe Brewster]: When you're working with mechanized units, you're looking more at conventional warfare, something you would expect to do if you were in Germany fighting in that terrain as opposed to Vietnam.

20:25.176 --> 20:26.298
[Tom Turbiville]: Okay, let's move on to the next one.

20:26.318 --> 20:28.602
[Tom Turbiville]: This next picture was actually taken from a book

20:28.868 --> 20:30.470
[Tom Turbiville]: that you supplied the picture.

20:30.490 --> 20:37.420
[Tom Turbiville]: I'm gonna let you talk about the book real quick, because we're running short on time, but this is a book written by a current professor at Blinn College about Cambodia.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.842
[Tom Turbiville]: And that is you on the right.

20:38.922 --> 20:39.382
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about that.

20:39.402 --> 20:39.763
[Joe Brewster]: That is correct.

20:39.963 --> 20:52.180
[Joe Brewster]: About five, six, seven years ago, I was reading one of the local paper here, and there was someone inquiring if you were an officer or an enlisted man that had fought in Cambodia during 1970, please get in touch with this person.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.264
[Joe Brewster]: So I thought about it for a couple of days and gave him a call.

20:55.244 --> 20:58.213
[Joe Brewster]: It was a lady who actually grew up in Cambodia.

20:58.253 --> 21:09.726
[Joe Brewster]: Her dad had been Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, and she grew up in the timeframe of the Kilmer Rouge, who took over Cambodia in the early 1970s through 75, the Killing Fields time.

21:10.246 --> 21:16.354
[Joe Brewster]: And she wanted to find out some information about the American military activities in Cambodia.

21:16.835 --> 21:24.625
[Joe Brewster]: And I was able to provide her some information, which when the book was written, she did mention my name once or twice, which I felt very gratified for.

21:25.165 --> 21:26.147
[Joe Brewster]: But she was a great lady.

21:26.207 --> 21:27.809
[Joe Brewster]: She spent five, six years writing this book.

21:27.829 --> 21:31.073
[Joe Brewster]: It's now published and can be picked up at a lot of local bookstores.

21:31.053 --> 21:36.344
[Joe Brewster]: This is where we're coming down from Conten, heading down towards the Cambodian border.

21:36.404 --> 21:43.800
[Joe Brewster]: We spent one or two days pulling security for transportation trucks along this route, and then we went into Cambodia itself to fight.

21:43.820 --> 21:44.060
[Joe Brewster]: Okay.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.643
[Tom Turbiville]: Let's move on to, I believe, our last picture.

21:45.663 --> 21:48.169
[Tom Turbiville]: And there's your dad, and there you are sitting next to him.

21:48.189 --> 21:51.496
[Tom Turbiville]: And this was a time that he was honored in Louisiana, right?

21:51.556 --> 21:52.217
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about this.

21:52.197 --> 22:00.526
[Joe Brewster]: Well, back in the 1960s, during the Cuban crisis, my dad, the 49th Army, was called up, headquartered out of Temple.

22:00.546 --> 22:02.628
[Joe Brewster]: He was a battalion commander.

22:02.648 --> 22:05.291
[Joe Brewster]: And they were sent down to Fort Polk, Louisiana.

22:05.311 --> 22:07.614
[Joe Brewster]: And all the armored units of the 49th were called down there.

22:07.634 --> 22:08.735
[Joe Brewster]: He spent a full year down there.

22:09.656 --> 22:13.700
[Joe Brewster]: And so this was probably about six, seven, eight years ago.

22:14.421 --> 22:20.888
[Joe Brewster]: They were going to honor a plaque to the 49th, and he was requested to come down there, and he was sort of the honoree.

22:21.543 --> 22:25.809
[Joe Brewster]: And it gave me an opportunity to spend time with my dad, hear more of the war stories that I heard as a kid.

22:26.290 --> 22:33.781
[Joe Brewster]: And as you get older and you've experienced that war situation, you've been there, you can ask questions a little bit differently than if you've never seen combat.

22:34.301 --> 22:39.028
[Joe Brewster]: So I was able now to go in there and find out specifically what did it feel like?

22:39.380 --> 22:42.607
[Joe Brewster]: You know, a lot of generic terms you ask, you know, what was it like in a war?

22:43.008 --> 22:44.451
[Joe Brewster]: And a person will give you a generic answer.

22:44.912 --> 22:53.630
[Joe Brewster]: But if you ask a specific question, like when that shrapnel buzzes by your head or you take casually, your hand is holding down a wound until the medics get there.

22:54.011 --> 22:55.414
[Joe Brewster]: What went through your head?

22:55.695 --> 22:59.683
[Joe Brewster]: I was now able to discuss that with him in sort of a soldier to soldier way.

23:00.389 --> 23:07.899
[Tom Turbiville]: Joe, you were awarded the Bronze Star Medal on two occasions for your action on two consecutive days, May 8th and 9th, 1970.

23:08.239 --> 23:11.323
[Tom Turbiville]: Talk about what happened those two days.

23:11.343 --> 23:19.113
[Joe Brewster]: We went into Cambodia, and up until then, most of our combat was small unit back in Vietnam.

23:19.393 --> 23:22.657
[Joe Brewster]: We got into Cambodia as a larger units fighting each other.

23:23.398 --> 23:24.760
[Joe Brewster]: And we had...

23:25.060 --> 23:26.263
[Joe Brewster]: landed our helicopters.

23:26.543 --> 23:28.407
[Joe Brewster]: My opportunity was the first opportunity to go in.

23:28.427 --> 23:32.496
[Joe Brewster]: And as soon as we hit the ground, helicopters left, we were hit from the wood line by the NVA.

23:32.516 --> 23:35.081
[Joe Brewster]: They were attacking a cache that was very important to them.

23:35.101 --> 23:37.507
[Joe Brewster]: We had to fight our way into the jungle for the next two or three days.

23:37.887 --> 23:44.301
[Joe Brewster]: We unsuccessfully kept trying to take that cache and that particular bunker complex, which we finally did take.

23:44.281 --> 23:53.654
[Joe Brewster]: During that time frame, I spent a lot of time in the front, giving directions, pulling wounded men back, and the Army thought that maybe I deserved a Bronze Star for that.

23:54.656 --> 23:59.963
[Joe Brewster]: I'm sure there were a lot of soldiers that did a lot more than I did that deserved a Bronze Star, didn't get it, but somehow I got nominated for it.

24:00.584 --> 24:07.774
[Joe Brewster]: On the next day or two later, we were bedwacked along one of the rivers there in Cambodia, getting ready to do another mission.

24:07.990 --> 24:19.688
[Joe Brewster]: and the Navy came down one of the rivers there, spotted us, and they had been ambushed several times the previous day, and they were a little bit on the touchy side, and apparently our higher command did not warn them that we were there.

24:20.389 --> 24:27.940
[Joe Brewster]: So they immediately opened fire with us with quad 50s, and they had an automatic 79 grenade launcher, and we started taking severe casualties.

24:28.156 --> 24:29.840
[Joe Brewster]: And someone had to get communication with them.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.563
[Joe Brewster]: We did not have their radio frequency.

24:31.984 --> 24:34.108
[Joe Brewster]: So someone had to get up and actually motion to them.

24:34.149 --> 24:35.572
[Joe Brewster]: We were Americans.

24:35.592 --> 24:39.179
[Joe Brewster]: And I guess I drew the black bean because I ended up being the one that did it.

24:39.199 --> 24:41.444
[Joe Brewster]: And apparently, again, somebody thought I deserved something for that.

24:41.905 --> 24:46.755
[Joe Brewster]: Again, medals should have been more adjusted than deserved elsewhere, I'm sure.

24:47.630 --> 24:56.161
[Tom Turbiville]: We need to move along, but with about a month left in your service, you were sent to the 1st Cavalry, but then eventually sent back to the 25th.

24:56.662 --> 25:01.948
[Tom Turbiville]: And talk about the message that you got that the Chief of Staff wanted to see you and what he had to say to you.

25:01.968 --> 25:09.638
[Joe Brewster]: Well, the 25th Infantry Provision received orders they were going to return home in probably November, October, November of 1970.

25:09.938 --> 25:15.026
[Joe Brewster]: because I still had a little over a month left in country, I was not able to ship home with a lot of the troops.

25:15.347 --> 25:19.814
[Joe Brewster]: I was sent to the first Cav, figuring I still had a month and a half left, and I could be of service to them.

25:19.834 --> 25:23.460
[Joe Brewster]: Went to their one-week school, and they realized, hey, you're a little still shoe sharp.

25:23.740 --> 25:24.622
[Joe Brewster]: You won't benefit us.

25:24.662 --> 25:28.608
[Joe Brewster]: And by that time, I got orders to return back to the 25th Infantry.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.852
[Joe Brewster]: Well, as soon as I hit the ground, there was a gentleman standing there.

25:30.872 --> 25:34.157
[Joe Brewster]: A lieutenant said that the chief of staff, full colonel, wanted to visit with me.

25:34.542 --> 25:38.927
[Joe Brewster]: So I entered his office, and normally a lieutenant does not want to face the chief of staff.

25:39.007 --> 25:40.809
[Joe Brewster]: There's normally something very, very wrong.

25:40.829 --> 25:42.811
[Joe Brewster]: In this case, he had my file in front of him.

25:42.871 --> 25:46.615
[Joe Brewster]: He indicated, well, you went through Ranger School, you went through Airborne, received a few medals.

25:46.635 --> 25:48.137
[Joe Brewster]: He said, you're exactly the person I'm looking for.

25:48.157 --> 25:52.081
[Joe Brewster]: I said, oh, no, not one of these deep, sort of black missions they're going to send me on.

25:52.462 --> 25:58.729
[Joe Brewster]: And it ended up being that he needed someone to take the vision colors of the 25th Infantry back to Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.

25:59.229 --> 26:02.473
[Joe Brewster]: And they felt like that I was the right person to do that.

26:02.943 --> 26:08.949
[Joe Brewster]: And it was quite an honor for me to receive the orders to do this.

26:08.969 --> 26:11.452
[Joe Brewster]: I trained with about 30 other gentlemen.

26:11.812 --> 26:13.514
[Joe Brewster]: We brought all the regimental colors in.

26:14.154 --> 26:16.977
[Joe Brewster]: Several of these troops had been Medal of Honor winners.

26:17.318 --> 26:18.879
[Joe Brewster]: So I got to hear their stories.

26:18.899 --> 26:21.001
[Joe Brewster]: They were quite the heroes.

26:21.021 --> 26:26.887
[Joe Brewster]: And then in the middle of December, we flew into Schofield Barracks there in Hawaii, met by a band.

26:27.388 --> 26:31.532
[Joe Brewster]: Then the next couple of days, the colors were transferred back to the 25th there in Hawaii.

26:32.069 --> 26:33.453
[Tom Turbiville]: I know that was quite an honor for you.

26:33.473 --> 26:41.256
[Tom Turbiville]: And it's something that probably of all your memories of your Vietnam experience, it was that at the end, bringing back the colors that is maybe the most meaningful to you.

26:41.878 --> 26:44.104
[Joe Brewster]: It is one that I'll always remember.

26:44.354 --> 26:50.505
[Joe Brewster]: I just that a lot of the soldiers that went to Vietnam did not have the great fortune I had of returning back to the United States.

26:50.905 --> 26:54.832
[Joe Brewster]: Most of the soldiers came back home and most of them were not met at the airport.

26:55.253 --> 26:57.276
[Joe Brewster]: There were no bands or anybody congratulating them.

26:57.757 --> 27:00.662
[Joe Brewster]: And yet here I was coming back with a band waiting for me.

27:00.762 --> 27:01.584
[Joe Brewster]: Congratulations.

27:02.065 --> 27:05.951
[Joe Brewster]: And so that made me feel extremely well thought of.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.838
[Joe Brewster]: Like, you know, my time in service was appreciated.

27:09.818 --> 27:13.062
[Tom Turbiville]: Joe Brewster, thank you very much for your service, and thank you for being here.

27:13.082 --> 27:13.402
[Tom Turbiville]: I appreciate it.

27:13.422 --> 27:15.725
[Tom Turbiville]: Growing up in Temple, Joe Brewster was sure of two things.

27:15.785 --> 27:18.428
[Tom Turbiville]: He would be an A&M cadet, and he would be a soldier.

27:18.448 --> 27:22.853
[Tom Turbiville]: He served both roles with distinction, and that's definitely a family trait.

27:22.873 --> 27:28.059
[Tom Turbiville]: We thank Joe Brewster and all veterans for their service, and we thank our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:28.079 --> 27:33.265
[Tom Turbiville]: For more stories of veterans, be sure to read Brazos Valley Heroes every Sunday in The Eagle.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.367
[Tom Turbiville]: For Lieutenant Joe Brewster, I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.070
[Tom Turbiville]: We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:43.070 --> 28:07.973
