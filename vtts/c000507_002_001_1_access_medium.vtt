WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:04.300
Okay, I guess the tape is rolling, so we might as well start.

00:06.180 --> 00:11.020
First of all, I wondered how you became involved in science fiction when you were younger.

00:11.020 --> 00:12.480
Did you read it a lot when you were young?

00:13.400 --> 00:18.600
Yes, I started reading science fiction, I suppose, as about the earliest form of literature

00:18.600 --> 00:19.280
that I read.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.920
I never made a mental distinction between science fiction, fantasy, anything of that

00:28.920 --> 00:35.880
nature, because my parents brought it to me to read, and I just simply regarded it as

00:35.880 --> 00:39.500
the most interesting reading material that I had accessible.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.840
So naturally, when I began turning to writing, that's what I wrote.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.720
Why did you start writing science fiction?

00:54.280 --> 00:58.020
Well, actually, they took my television program off the air.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.620
Our television, at that time, I was ten.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.000
Television hadn't been around in private homes very long.

01:06.660 --> 01:12.920
I had just time enough to get thoroughly addicted to television science fiction, and then it ran its course,

01:12.940 --> 01:14.520
and it was gone from the air.

01:14.760 --> 01:22.840
So I, in a fit of mourning, went into the bedroom, picked up a tablet and pencil, and started writing my own novels.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.560
Your first published novel, I think, was around 1976, The Gate of Iverill?

01:30.880 --> 01:31.880
Yes, yes.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.780
Had you published any stories before then?

01:35.180 --> 01:41.460
No, not for want of trying, but I've never regarded myself as a short story writer.

01:41.800 --> 01:52.540
I don't tend to sink in that convenient length, and consequently, I wrote novels and novels,

01:52.540 --> 02:04.720
and was actually turned in Brothers of Earth first, and since there seemed to be some question about it being a little long,

02:05.400 --> 02:17.280
as many of my works tend to be, I very, very quickly wrote Gate of Iverill while teaching school, etc.,

02:17.280 --> 02:20.120
and managed to get it finished inside two months.

02:23.620 --> 02:31.920
One thing I wondered is, you said that you didn't distinguish between science fiction and the other reading that you did,

02:32.720 --> 02:36.940
but I wonder why you didn't do some other kind of writing instead of science fiction.

02:37.060 --> 02:40.720
I think you could have been a writer in almost any area that you tried.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.880
Well, I didn't write the other things because I didn't like them in general.

02:45.880 --> 02:55.580
I find that I suppose the only thing outside of science fiction that I've ever tried my hand at writing has been mysteries,

02:57.000 --> 03:07.260
and I don't care for the modern fashion of those, and I've always viewed them as a great deal more fun to read than they are to write,

03:07.960 --> 03:17.580
mostly because you have to be extremely controlled, and I suspect that mystery writers have to know who did it,

03:17.880 --> 03:20.440
and I'd rather not know the end of my books.

03:23.120 --> 03:30.080
The other thing that I've tried my hand at is historical fiction, and I find, again, that's a straight jacket,

03:30.160 --> 03:34.740
because you're rather well-held with what happened, whether or not it makes artistic sense.

03:34.740 --> 03:40.520
So just for the sheer pleasure of writing, I prefer science fiction.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.680
Okay. Was it Donnie Holheim that published that first book?

03:47.060 --> 03:47.680
Yes, it was.

03:49.940 --> 03:55.200
Have you established any contact or made any attempts, or was that the first one that you'd sent out?

03:57.300 --> 04:00.560
You mean with other publishing houses and what have you?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.320
No, with Don Holheim.

04:03.900 --> 04:09.960
Well, actually, I grew fascinated with Holheim as an editor,

04:10.860 --> 04:16.500
because I had gone through my library finally after seven years of trying to sell things,

04:16.520 --> 04:21.840
and I thought, well, there must be a system to this. You see, I had no professional help at all.

04:22.840 --> 04:30.820
And I began searching my library to see what editor had published the majority of works and writers that I liked,

04:30.820 --> 04:34.320
figuring that we might have something in common as far as taste goes.

04:35.460 --> 04:47.380
So I began researching Don Holheim to see what his preferences were, where we differed and where we were similar.

04:47.920 --> 04:55.540
And so I began to conclude more and more that we were fairly well-synthetic when it came to taste.

04:55.540 --> 05:00.860
Not quite the same all the way down the line, but generally there's a broad area of overlap.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.700
So I found him very easy to work with.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.400
Okay. I just had one more question on your back end and so forth.

05:13.340 --> 05:20.680
Do you identify or do you think there are any influences, either writers or anything in your back?

05:20.680 --> 05:24.700
I guess in terms of science fiction writers, did any, had any influence on you in the way you write?

05:26.080 --> 05:34.400
Well, it's very difficult to put a, to pin it down, because I am one of the most Catholic science fiction writers, readers you're likely to find.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.000
I read everything I can get my hands on and always have. I'm a speed reader.

05:40.200 --> 05:49.060
But classically speaking, I suppose that Publius Virgilius Marrow is one of the outstanding influences on my writing,

05:49.060 --> 05:59.320
simply because he's one writer that I spent an enormous amount of time with, at least historically speaking, when I was doing my studies.

06:00.740 --> 06:11.060
In terms of science fiction writers that have had a great deal of influence on me, I can remember some of the early works that I read were

06:12.580 --> 06:22.960
Heinlein Asimov, Norton, Harry Bates, Howard, Robert Howard.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.300
It was very difficult in the town that I grew up in to find any science fiction. Jack Williamson was one.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.380
And Edgar Rice Burroughs and so on.

06:33.940 --> 06:44.040
I, by the time that, you see, I kept getting run out of the store, they would locate a juvenile back there in the science fiction section,

06:44.140 --> 06:52.860
and immediately they would begin to suggest that possibly I should be looking at the Dick and Jane novels somewhere else.

06:53.940 --> 07:02.940
And so I did have a little difficulty both in library and in bookstores trying to get out with science fiction books undetected.

07:05.460 --> 07:11.980
Okay. You said you, I think you said you'd sent out or written Brothers of Earth before Gate of Ibrail,

07:12.020 --> 07:18.600
but I still wanted to ask why you so early got into writing the, I guess I would call it heroic fantasy.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.960
I'm not sure that's how you'd identify the Gate of Ibrail, but why did you sort of begin with that kind of a?

07:24.700 --> 07:29.560
Well, I didn't. They weren't the first books that I had written.

07:31.160 --> 07:39.360
There are others which are tentative efforts that didn't pan out in one way or another.

07:39.760 --> 07:45.680
Everybody, I won't say everybody, but a majority of writers tend to have them.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.500
My first love is really technology.

07:49.440 --> 08:01.940
The only thing is that I had been out of the technological mainstream while they had made numerous scientific advances that I was not current with.

08:02.820 --> 08:14.140
And it annoys me a great deal to feel that I'm writing something that is not technically accurate, or that I have glossed over something.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.060
It irritates me personally to postulate, well, for instance, we have a gravity field here which keeps everyone's feet on the deck.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.240
I want to know how it works.

08:28.380 --> 08:35.220
So consequently, I wrote heroic fantasy while I was doing a great deal of reading in Scientific American.

08:36.040 --> 08:49.480
Also, heroic fantasy is an area where I have a good deal of expertise since I have a major in Classics, History, Archaeology, Anthropology, this sort of thing.

08:50.060 --> 08:58.280
But I had always been a sort of a hobbyist, and a little more than a hobbyist since it was one of my fields in the history of technology.

09:03.660 --> 09:09.480
Okay, I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce some of these names right, so after I hear you pronounce them, we'll get them right when we do the show.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.360
All right.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.320
I guess it's more game.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.320
I still have a little puzzlement about her.

09:17.500 --> 09:23.540
Was she a creature or a force existing before the call, or the call?

09:23.660 --> 09:25.000
I'm not sure how that's pronounced.

09:25.000 --> 09:25.940
The call.

09:26.840 --> 09:38.400
Well, actually, there's some of this that I am not about to give away as regards to the history of more game because that gets into the possibility of a book that I'm working on at the moment.

09:39.040 --> 09:46.620
The first set of the books, the gate books, involve much more the character of Vanya, who is a medieval man.

09:47.640 --> 10:00.880
I have to take his viewpoint, or they cease to be heroic fantasy and they begin to be a science fiction novel, pure and simple, because Morgaine is far more technologically sophisticated than he is.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.340
And if it were told from her viewpoint, it would begin to be a thing of numbers and calculus.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.680
Morgaine is far more advanced exactly where she comes from and what she is.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.720
I've referred to leave to the to the reader's estimation.

10:16.820 --> 10:22.900
Although I will say that your your surmises are fairly well down the center.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.280
OK, that's why I wasn't sure.

10:26.340 --> 10:27.300
I thought maybe I missed something.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.640
I thought you were being a little ambiguous.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.340
It is deliberately vague.

10:31.780 --> 10:36.840
Partially because the character of Morgaine has evolved as I've done it.

10:37.540 --> 10:43.780
Also partially because I have wished to keep those books as heroic fantasy.

10:44.580 --> 10:50.040
For the reason that the technology of the gates is so vague that, again, I prefer to know how things work.

10:50.200 --> 10:56.680
And since that one is far more fantastical than some of the other technology I work with, I prefer to keep it in the realm of fantasy.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.300
OK, you also just said that you might be working where you are working on some more books that might involve that material.

11:03.320 --> 11:08.000
I was going to ask, did you, when you started the first book, did you have the idea of a trilogy?

11:08.700 --> 11:13.020
No. Actually the first book quit where it quit.

11:15.480 --> 11:21.660
Except that they had been entered into the books in print as a series, which rather surprised me.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.900
And so I thought, well, why not?

11:26.260 --> 11:38.400
For a little while I found it relaxing, and to a certain extent still do, to alternate both my reading and my writing of hard tech with fantasy.

11:39.040 --> 11:48.380
Because I do produce at an enormous rate compared to some other writers who may labor one or two years on a book.

11:49.760 --> 11:55.800
Well, a good deal of anyone working on a book for one or two years is not writing time, it's thinking time.

11:56.900 --> 12:03.700
And because physically to write it down takes a precious little while, you can write any given book down in less than a month.

12:03.860 --> 12:04.920
You can just think of that.

12:05.940 --> 12:14.320
So I found that to give my imagination a rest, as it were, it does really help to shift gears between books.

12:14.320 --> 12:20.120
That's why I tend to do things which are radically different one from the other.

12:20.180 --> 12:25.320
I may worry over a similar theme. I may do it once in science fiction and once in fantasy.

12:26.160 --> 12:35.800
Thus providing endless amusement or fodder for reviewers who are trying to find some sort of a common theme.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.520
Well, basically it's just that I just finished working with that and it was still rattling around in my head.

12:40.520 --> 12:49.140
I did it in a different medium, just as an artist may tend to paint a lot in blue because that's the color they had last on their palette.

12:49.720 --> 12:55.420
I don't think there's any particularly deep significance to some of these similarities,

12:55.520 --> 13:03.380
just that some of the works were done in sort of opposition to each other, different types, different styles.

13:06.340 --> 13:10.020
Was there any reader response that made you continue with that series?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.740
Well, there has been a great deal of reader response.

13:14.060 --> 13:22.300
I think that it's a very... I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.420
I look back on it and decide I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:27.420 --> 13:36.400
Sometimes the character of Morgaine irritated me so much that I was just about ready to give up, throw in the towel while I was creating it.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.260
I think I tend to sympathize much more with Vanya.

13:42.240 --> 13:53.560
But yes, there has been a very strong reader response to it and I've always had a really great affection for this trilogy myself.

13:53.560 --> 14:01.800
It's one of the few works that I have really felt that I could go back to and possibly do another three books.

14:04.360 --> 14:11.860
Usually, when you've written enough... when you've written three books on anything, you tend to be burned out on it.

14:12.220 --> 14:18.900
Because while the reader may devour it in a single night or series of nights and it's gone for the writer,

14:18.900 --> 14:26.720
you had to live with it constantly for the better part of the year on each segment.

14:29.260 --> 14:38.080
So for some curious reason, the Morgaine books are one of the only ones that I really find easy to return to.

14:40.280 --> 14:45.660
Okay, you mentioned that Vanya was a medieval man and of course heroic fantasy.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.320
I guess a lot of the elements that would go back to the medieval formulas.

14:49.700 --> 14:59.420
But it seems to me that you have in some ways reversed the normal formula in making the heroic part of the book,

14:59.420 --> 15:06.800
a woman and her, I don't know what you'd want to call her, not sidekick but her helper, I guess the male.

15:07.560 --> 15:13.720
I heard some readers respond that they were not surprised at that, but it was a little unusual to have the male in that position.

15:13.720 --> 15:21.400
Well, I think that it's... there is of course literary tradition for it.

15:22.080 --> 15:26.260
The notion of courtly love, I suppose, is one possibility.

15:28.660 --> 15:42.780
There is also the fact that in terms of the age at which those characters were created,

15:44.740 --> 15:51.480
I had really conceived both characters when I was about probably fourteen.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.760
And again, I think a reason why it's much easier for me to return to those,

15:57.860 --> 16:05.120
because they almost come out of my extreme youth and I suppose one always has an affection for things of that sort.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.180
They are sort of archetypal with us.

16:07.820 --> 16:13.120
But in one form or another, they are very early creations of mine.

16:13.120 --> 16:23.600
And as such, that was the time at which I was really just beginning to toy with being able to do male characters at all.

16:24.400 --> 16:34.680
Of course, there was the version that is in print was done completely separate from any of the earlier works.

16:34.700 --> 16:41.540
I didn't look at or refer to the earlier works when I did this, when I did Gate of Ibrell.

16:41.540 --> 16:45.220
I just sort of remembered it a long time ago.

16:45.240 --> 16:50.700
But I suppose that's the reason that the characters formed the way they did.

16:51.460 --> 16:59.160
There's also the fact that I think that artistically, to me, made a fairly interesting story

17:01.280 --> 17:04.580
in terms of the relationship between the two characters.

17:04.580 --> 17:12.200
And I think that's the fact that Zanya's besetting sin, if you will, is arrogance, pride, and temper.

17:13.320 --> 17:22.860
And if you can conceive of any situation for a medieval man in which arrogance, pride, and temper are going to get a little frayed,

17:23.040 --> 17:24.360
it's this sort of situation.

17:27.860 --> 17:31.160
Okay. I'm going to go ahead and move on to a whole new topic.

17:32.320 --> 17:37.920
I think one of the things that impressed me the most, and I'm sure it impresses most of your readers greatly,

17:38.020 --> 17:40.300
is your construction of alien cultures.

17:42.540 --> 17:49.600
And I was curious as to whether you use models or analogs for them, or do you create them out of thin air?

17:51.460 --> 17:53.000
Yes and no, and both.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.620
One of my areas of study, as before mentioned, is anthropology.

17:59.980 --> 18:07.760
I've also done a great deal of study in ecology, biology, genetics,

18:09.060 --> 18:13.700
although strictly as an amateur in that field because it is a very complex one.

18:17.040 --> 18:33.260
And in a way, I do take some items from the knowledge that I have of earthly animals, cultures, communities, ecosystems, and so on.

18:33.260 --> 18:47.720
But most of my knowledge of human culture is, again, rather strange in that I know the prehistoric or Bronze Age,

18:48.080 --> 18:55.180
that whole span, up to the Iron Age, much better than I do, say, later periods.

18:56.180 --> 19:05.800
So a great deal of what I know about human history is so basic or lies so far back down the time track

19:05.800 --> 19:22.340
that a divergence from what happened at any given point is going to produce massive alterations in an urban culture much further along the line.

19:23.320 --> 19:28.880
Consequently, for instance, when I did the Fated Sun novels, which are basically a desert culture,

19:28.900 --> 19:35.460
I did not pattern it off any modern desert culture about which I know, frankly, nothing.

19:36.660 --> 19:42.480
I patterned it strictly by taking what I know about desert survival.

19:42.480 --> 19:59.260
And earlier nomadic cultures here on earth contrived a biology that would work under the extreme conditions that I postulated

19:59.260 --> 20:03.380
and then drew elements from here and there.

20:04.220 --> 20:13.580
It's very strange that I now get letters from people that say that it very closely resembles a modern terrestrial nomadic culture.

20:14.620 --> 20:23.860
But this is strictly a surprise to me. I suppose it just says that I knew something about the variation from it.

20:25.480 --> 20:33.640
Okay. Why does, I guess in many of your books, I would even say the majority,

20:35.520 --> 20:41.640
you somehow in the book have a theme or a motif of alien-human closeness.

20:43.580 --> 20:49.880
You know, sometimes your humans have actually become part of an alien civilization. If they don't, at least they become very close to it.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.920
Why does that fascinate you so much?

20:53.580 --> 21:02.980
Well, partly I suppose it's what I said earlier, that one tends to toss one idea around until you've got that color completely off your palette.

21:05.140 --> 21:12.860
I don't know how long it will continue to fascinate me. I suppose there's a limit to how much one can say about any given thing.

21:14.080 --> 21:24.100
And not all of my novels involve aliens. Among those novels I count some that are not yet published, but are only partially complete.

21:24.160 --> 21:29.560
If I say that I have about 13 works in progress at the moment, you may understand.

21:32.900 --> 21:37.880
So what is on the stands is sort of the tip of the iceberg, at least as far as my body of work.

21:37.880 --> 21:49.300
But indeed I do a great deal of it. I think part of the fascination for it lies in the fact that I myself have been a lifelong student of cultures.

21:50.220 --> 21:57.860
And if there's anything that I can conceive of that is slightly stranger than being lost in Greece and unable to speak the local dialect,

21:58.600 --> 22:05.080
it's being lost somewhere else and in even worse shape and managed, managing to survive it.

22:05.080 --> 22:16.560
It pleases me also because it is a type of conflict that one can develop that does not involve necessarily everyone taking sides, lining up, and starting to shoot at each other.

22:17.080 --> 22:23.960
Although this sometimes does happen. It is a way to, it's sort of like the Man Against Nature story.

22:24.020 --> 22:28.960
You can have a very exciting story about a man who is simply trying to survive in a hostile environment.

22:28.960 --> 22:37.040
Well, some environments don't involve icebergs, they involve cities. They involve cultures that you've never met before.

22:37.960 --> 22:49.820
And I do hope, just as a matter of practical philosophy, that one thing this age of ours has begun to produce is an understanding in the human race

22:49.820 --> 22:56.340
that we can not only get along with each other, we can get along with other creatures on the same planet.

22:56.340 --> 23:02.220
Perhaps it is the final lesson that any species learns before they are fit to set foot in space.

23:02.820 --> 23:09.120
At least I hope this is the case, which may guarantee the peaceful intention of potential neighbors.

23:10.740 --> 23:19.720
I think you've sort of answered my next question, which was going to be if you deliberately counterpointed alien and human cultures.

23:21.320 --> 23:27.960
You just suggested there would be a value to that. That we should learn to live with other species and so forth.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.180
That would be a fair statement that you do counterpoint?

23:32.360 --> 23:44.080
Yes. One of the most difficult things on the face of the earth, for instance, is for two people who do not speak each other's language well to communicate.

23:44.080 --> 23:56.980
It's also certainly true, as diplomats have discovered for centuries, that you can speak someone else's language perfectly and still have trouble getting your point across.

23:57.380 --> 24:10.000
Simply because language extends into time, history, and accumulated meanings as well as it does just the present meanings which are contained in the dictionary.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.880
The context and history have a great bearing on language.

24:16.000 --> 24:30.260
So that when you begin to talk about the difficulties of communicating species to species where you may even have a totally different psychology, your problems are much more severe.

24:30.260 --> 24:35.720
It is also an area of ongoing research in the scientific community.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.920
The studies that are done with primates, the studies that are done with dolphins and with whales.

24:43.740 --> 24:57.500
Mankind as a whole, outside of the science fiction field, is finally beginning to wake up to the fact that you do not necessarily have to think like a human being to be, quote, intelligent.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.160
That intelligence is a function of many different things.

25:02.160 --> 25:14.060
Anyone who has ever taught in school will rapidly come to the conclusion that intelligence is not a quantity that can be neatly assessed.

25:14.740 --> 25:22.960
It has to do with spatial perceptions in relationships, with the ability to compare and to analyze.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.320
Human intelligence is made up of many, many different factors.

25:26.320 --> 25:35.400
One may be particularly gifted in one or more of them, not so gifted in others, and it makes for a great range of abilities.

25:35.960 --> 25:45.460
Even more so when you're dealing with different species who may have completely different environments, whose visual range may be different.

25:48.020 --> 25:51.200
Some may see, for instance, into the infrared.

25:52.800 --> 25:58.900
Some may hear sounds which are not audible, so on and so forth, just biologically speaking.

25:59.360 --> 26:09.220
So you may have a psychology and a history that are very, very different from anything that we're anticipating simply because of a biological barrier.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.640
Okay, I guess I'll just move on to a question, questions on a few of your works.

26:16.640 --> 26:22.600
Obviously I'm not going to be able to hit all of your works. We don't have time to do that, but there were a few of them I wanted to single out.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.520
I think it's pronounced the pride of Chonur.

26:29.120 --> 26:36.300
Okay, let me just ask you this question first of all. Is it the honey?

26:37.020 --> 26:37.920
Honey, yes.

26:39.040 --> 26:47.020
I somehow see the impression their society, their physical makeup was in some ways based on lions.

26:47.220 --> 27:07.900
Yes, absolutely. This is one case where I've taken the species of lions and in a very simple way devised a culture of an advanced species which very closely parallels the biological barrier.

27:07.900 --> 27:14.840
The psychology and, if you will, social patterns of a lion pride. The title of the book, of course, is a three-way pun.

27:18.340 --> 27:24.020
Meaning the pride of lions, the pride of the race, and the name of the ship?

27:24.200 --> 27:27.840
And the ship, yes. All of which are involved together.

27:28.980 --> 27:33.520
And also that would be why the females are the ones who go spacefaring and the males stay at home.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.980
Yes, among the lions you will notice it is the females who do the hunting.

27:40.460 --> 27:46.420
Okay, I'm proud of myself. Tali, the human in that book.

27:48.920 --> 27:54.340
Of course, he is totally alone. He's a very pitiful creature, the only one of his kind, I guess, until near the end of the book.

27:55.940 --> 28:06.860
Very unheroic. It's a while, all of a sudden I realize I'm reading the book from an alien point of view and here's a human being and I'm feeling sorry for him, which is unusual.

28:09.920 --> 28:16.160
I guess that was just for the line of the story. Do you do that on purpose, to give us a different perspective on humanity?

28:16.720 --> 28:19.580
Have you ever seen a baboon react to a leopard?

28:20.320 --> 28:20.760
No.

28:20.760 --> 28:29.980
Well, it's raw terror. A primate's nervous system is not really set up to be setting in the center of a pride of lions.

28:31.580 --> 28:42.040
It's really one of the most unkind things I believe that you could do to a human being as far as social patterns would be to drop them right into the middle of a feline culture.

28:44.620 --> 28:54.020
Because the moves are all wrong. For instance, Tali, being a primate, smiles.

28:55.420 --> 29:01.140
And of course, this is exactly the wrong thing to do. You know what a lion does when it smiles. It's not a friendly gesture.

29:02.780 --> 29:11.740
Every gesture he makes is wrong. Every gesture they make is wrong, at least as far as he's concerned.

29:12.380 --> 29:18.400
He is, however, a very heroic human being, if you just simply analyze what he has done.

29:19.940 --> 29:24.080
He has managed to survive a very horrendous situation.

29:24.080 --> 29:31.160
He has managed to collect himself with some dignity out of a situation which would have broken drastically.

29:33.100 --> 29:37.140
Any average individual would have definitely come out of it damaged.

29:38.780 --> 29:49.440
He's been forced to take horrendous decisions, and he's been dumped into a situation where even his personal value is of some question.

29:49.440 --> 30:03.080
And yet he manages to stand up on his signed seat and confront the honey captain with a here I am, come and see if you can do something about it kind of attitude,

30:03.180 --> 30:08.140
which is of course what wins the captain's respect in the beginning.

30:08.920 --> 30:26.120
He calms down a little bit, as you will see when he begins trying to deal with them, doing what any sensible person would do when confronted with a situation where you suspect that the beings around you are at least essentially friendly,

30:26.120 --> 30:32.780
and there's no need provoking something that would be a total misunderstanding.

30:33.700 --> 30:45.660
So he does remain a little bit quiet, but he's quiet partially because he's smart and is trying to absorb more data than he gives out.

30:47.960 --> 30:55.320
Okay, I see that now. I suppose, yeah, in terms of where he was, I guess he was sort of a courageous individual.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.520
Let me move on for just a second to Down Below Station.

31:01.220 --> 31:06.740
The plotting and the setting of that novel impressed me a great deal.

31:06.740 --> 31:18.400
Did you use a strict extrapolation to devise the society and the company and the merchants and the way you set that book up?

31:19.820 --> 31:23.880
Yes, I follow the NASA reports.

31:25.960 --> 31:33.580
I'm a great supporter of the space program and I do follow it very, very closely.

31:33.580 --> 31:45.980
And one of the things that has always interested me is the economic mechanisms, the reason for going into space, the reason for colonization.

31:45.980 --> 32:00.960
I also recall being caught some rather inaccurate things when I was back in summer school about the altruistic motives for colonization.

32:01.180 --> 32:09.140
To hear some of the old tales I heard, the Greeks all went out and colonized the Mediterranean just because it was there,

32:09.140 --> 32:17.860
or just because they felt it would be a noble thing to do, which is very far from the truth. It was economic necessity.

32:20.060 --> 32:24.620
And they were, many of them were getting out of Greece because the pressures at home were incredible.

32:26.700 --> 32:37.980
In this particular instance, I simply took the situation that we presently have and as a background for the novel,

32:37.980 --> 32:43.980
I simply extrapolated our present situation forward a couple of hundred years.

32:44.760 --> 33:00.720
And this is pretty well what I see going on based on modern economic necessity and a little bit of altruism in the sense that science and science for the sake of science will continue.

33:00.720 --> 33:12.060
If you like, we've already launched the first star probes. Our problem is that right now we haven't got the budget or the research to enable them to do a loop and come back to us.

33:12.720 --> 33:18.640
But I imagine that early in the next century there will be such probes launched.

33:20.540 --> 33:24.360
Was that book more difficult to plot and harder to write than your others?

33:24.360 --> 33:34.880
It was a bear. It really was. I think because it was sort of a collection of all the things that I had been trying to do up to that point,

33:35.000 --> 33:45.920
all the research, all the reading that I had been doing in trying to rationalize this universe of mine, to give it some sort of scientific accuracy.

33:46.840 --> 33:57.760
The one thing you have to grant me is faster than light travel. Everything else I designed is at least within near reach of our capabilities.

34:01.940 --> 34:11.360
The plot is necessarily complex because we're dealing here with the future of the human race.

34:13.420 --> 34:18.700
The human race is actually the character in this novel in one odd sense.

34:19.740 --> 34:24.720
There are a number of specimens of it who are not too nice.

34:24.720 --> 34:33.020
Fortunately, there are some who are, at least in my own estimation, good people.

34:34.080 --> 34:41.440
The novel follows the activities of a great many of them at a very hazardous moment for humanity,

34:41.960 --> 34:49.720
that at which part of humanity is literally breaking free of Earth, never to come back again,

34:49.720 --> 35:04.580
in which another portion of humanity is trying to retain their heritage and to try to reach an accommodation between what they were and what they are,

35:07.520 --> 35:14.940
and manage to deal with the new realities that they're meeting at the same time.

35:16.860 --> 35:22.080
This probably isn't a fair question to ask an author. I've had a number of them say, make up your own mind.

35:25.180 --> 35:33.220
In terms of who you side with, if you side with anybody, I identified more with Signe Mallory than anybody in the book.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.860
Would that be anywhere near what you intended?

35:36.780 --> 35:45.140
To a certain extent, yes. Signe Mallory is a very enigmatic individual in some ways.

35:46.320 --> 35:51.280
She's difficult, even for her creator, to get a handle on.

35:52.420 --> 35:55.040
There are a number of things going on with her.

35:55.040 --> 36:04.880
To a certain extent, it disturbs me that she is as heroic as she is,

36:04.880 --> 36:11.940
because when you analyze what she does, you really have to line her up on the side of the not nice people.

36:14.260 --> 36:21.120
On the other hand, if you got into an argument with her on morality,

36:22.360 --> 36:32.840
she would point to the morality that created the ghastly situation on the station and ask who got the better results.

36:35.280 --> 36:40.000
Mallory is forever dealing in very, very uncomfortable paradoxes.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.120
Often, even the author does not like what Mallory does,

36:44.840 --> 36:50.120
but sometimes it is the most direct solution that saves the greatest number of lives.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.760
She is, as I say, sort of an uncomfortable figure.

36:56.760 --> 37:03.600
As that history of that world develops in subsequent books,

37:05.600 --> 37:12.800
I think it will become clear that Mallory's influence persists among those people,

37:12.860 --> 37:15.140
and it is not always a wholesome one.

37:16.020 --> 37:21.200
Mallory as Mallory can be a very palatable, very appealing individual.

37:21.200 --> 37:29.340
The problem is that some people persist in following her policies and come to less happy results.

37:31.660 --> 37:37.540
So it is a kind of a novel that lays the foundation for a good many things.

37:39.000 --> 37:49.260
For instance, the security organization in The Fated Son, the rather sinister Vegas, I believe his name is,

37:50.460 --> 37:53.080
several centuries down the road, Mallory's creation.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.820
Okay, that's interesting. I was just going to move on to that.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.760
Let me give you one more question on Down Below Station.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.420
Well, in fact, it applies to Fated Son too, and a couple of your other books.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.840
You've already mentioned the fact that we have to give you the faster-than-light travel.

38:10.920 --> 38:16.400
Still, concerning the so-called jump and the, say, the space battles in Down Below Station,

38:16.980 --> 38:21.340
I don't think I've read any more convincing space battles than those.

38:24.220 --> 38:30.040
And the faster-than-light travel, the jump and so forth, you didn't make any attempt at all to,

38:30.440 --> 38:35.040
and I guess you can't back it up or prove anything there, but there was enough science behind that,

38:35.080 --> 38:37.760
or enough, I don't know how you did it, where it was convincing.

38:39.220 --> 38:44.580
Well, I worked very hard at it. I always loved Doc Smith.

38:47.280 --> 38:53.580
And one of the things that I always felt that I would like to bring back to the field of science fiction,

38:53.580 --> 38:58.660
if I could, was the space yarn.

38:59.480 --> 39:04.860
I mean, for a long time now, science fiction, we've been on planets, we've built cities,

39:04.860 --> 39:15.840
we've gotten so earthbound that a lot of the romance of space flight itself has gone unexpressed in literature.

39:17.080 --> 39:24.720
And I wish to be able to develop a mechanism which would enable me to write,

39:24.780 --> 39:28.220
oddly enough, after working my brains out on it,

39:28.220 --> 39:34.320
this simple kind of story that I used to enjoy when I was young.

39:35.460 --> 39:45.000
And I suddenly realized that I was in it to my neck in relativistic time, all sorts of things.

39:45.560 --> 39:49.340
One of the things that fascinated me when I began to work out the battles,

39:50.380 --> 39:55.820
and even there I took some shortcuts, as anyone who wants to get in and argue it,

39:55.820 --> 40:00.720
I will freely admit that there were some things I had to do for artistic value.

40:02.320 --> 40:10.280
But one of the things that I began to discover was that in terms of being on one of those ships in the battle,

40:11.620 --> 40:16.720
that suddenly in a very practical way I was up against the Einsteinian stoppage of time.

40:18.060 --> 40:22.580
Because when you are traveling near sea, near the speed of light,

40:22.580 --> 40:26.480
aboard one of those ships, all time has stopped.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.800
You exist at one moment, traveling forever.

40:30.080 --> 40:33.720
If you send a message, it can go no faster than you do.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.600
You and that message will arrive at the same time.

40:36.900 --> 40:40.360
So essentially you exist in a frozen segment of time,

40:41.300 --> 40:46.580
an event horizon which is perpetuating itself across the system in which you're operating.

40:47.540 --> 40:51.900
And I began to find that a rather mind-bending concept,

40:52.940 --> 40:57.700
particularly when I was trying to plot out the strategy.

40:58.520 --> 41:03.800
You know, if your enemy exists as an event horizon and you exist as another one,

41:04.120 --> 41:06.140
how thickens you going to figure out where he is?

41:08.940 --> 41:11.720
Okay, listen, David has to flip the tape about.
