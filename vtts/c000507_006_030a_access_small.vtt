Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.140 --> 00:33.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.720
And here are your hosts.

00:42.120 --> 00:47.200
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane, British-born author James P. Hogan, has gained a reputation

00:47.200 --> 00:50.120
as one of the premier writers of hard science fiction working today.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.980
He's published seven novels so far, including In Here at the Stars, The Gentle Giants of

00:54.980 --> 01:00.020
Gain-A-Meade, Giant Star, Thrice Upon a Time, The Two Faces of Tomorrow, and his latest

01:00.020 --> 01:00.880
Voyage from Yesterday.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.100
Hogan tells us how he became an author.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.580
When I left school when I was sixteen and wanted to be a writer then, I guess it was

01:12.080 --> 01:16.820
something that I always enjoyed doing as a kid at school, you know, the essays and the

01:16.820 --> 01:19.040
story writing exercises you get.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.540
And when I left school I told the world I was going to be a writer.

01:25.600 --> 01:33.000
And you could think of a good idea until somebody said, well, with all the accumulated wisdom

01:33.000 --> 01:36.940
and experience of sixteen years, what are you going to write about that the world is

01:36.940 --> 01:38.260
breathlessly waiting to hear?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.260
And I hadn't thought about that.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.480
The answer was not a lot.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.160
So I went away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that for something

01:48.160 --> 01:49.040
like twenty years.

01:50.240 --> 01:57.220
And I suppose the interest in writing probably never went away.

01:58.300 --> 02:02.500
For twenty years Hogan worked as a systems designer for computers and sold computers

02:02.500 --> 02:04.340
to scientists for use in their research.

02:04.780 --> 02:08.840
Associating with scientists as he did, Hogan was exposed to all sorts of current scientific

02:08.840 --> 02:13.160
research and he would make use of his scientific contacts when he began to write seriously.

02:13.160 --> 02:20.260
I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which was kind of handy.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.880
I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and other customers who were studied

02:25.880 --> 02:31.240
pieces of rock brought back from the Apollo missions and other guys who were building

02:31.240 --> 02:34.220
in or investigating machine intelligence.

02:34.480 --> 02:40.200
Just about any of the topics or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could take

02:40.200 --> 02:47.020
out of a hat, the chances were sort of ten to one I had a customer specializing in that

02:47.020 --> 02:51.740
field and I just had to, if I needed some background information on a particular topic

02:51.740 --> 02:56.540
I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my diary as a guy who could talk all day

02:56.540 --> 02:57.000
about it.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.920
And they loved doing it as well I used to call them and they'd like to come and talk

03:02.920 --> 03:03.440
to you tomorrow.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.100
Well we're a little busy but what's it about?

03:07.100 --> 03:10.120
Oh I need some help with the book I'm working on.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.160
Well why didn't you say so?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.260
What times do you want to show up?

03:12.760 --> 03:13.640
And they talk all day.

03:14.820 --> 03:25.820
I think this is one of the interesting sides of selling computers into this kind of area.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.960
You can imagine some of these specialists they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever

03:32.960 --> 03:38.360
and they end up shutting the back rooms of universities and maybe there are four people

03:38.360 --> 03:43.880
on the planet they can talk to who understand their language and sometimes they find it

03:43.880 --> 03:51.040
hard to believe that somebody from the world outside that has walked in off the street

03:51.040 --> 03:58.160
is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them and is curious and wants to know

03:58.160 --> 03:59.840
what they're doing, wants to have it explained.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.700
So writing about his experiences with scientists, Hogan found that he was a science fiction writer.

04:07.540 --> 04:12.900
I didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer I suppose I became one by accident.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.460
I just always wanted to write and started writing stories about the little bit of life

04:18.460 --> 04:24.240
that I had some personal experience of and was told I was a science fiction writer and

04:24.240 --> 04:24.940
I said how's that?

04:25.220 --> 04:29.480
And they said well the publisher is publishing it under their science fiction influence so

04:29.480 --> 04:33.960
I said okay and it kind of started out like that.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.920
Hogan's books are scientifically accurate and highly realistic.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.080
He's been called the man who put science back into science fiction.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.020
Next time we'll talk to James P. Hogan about some of his novels.

04:51.460 --> 04:55.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

04:55.680 --> 04:59.840
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:00.220 --> 06:05.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.700
And here are your hosts.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.080
This is Daryl Lane.

06:15.320 --> 06:15.940
And David Carson.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.180
James P. Hogan's 1977 science fiction novel Inherit the Stars should be required reading

06:21.180 --> 06:24.240
for anyone who demands scientific accuracy in an exciting narrative.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.560
The book takes place some 50 years in the future.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.240
A skeleton inside a space suit is found on the moon.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.320
That's interesting enough, but what follows is even more provocative.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.320
The skeleton is a human one and it's been on the moon for 50,000 years.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.940
The scientific unraveling of this mystery forms the basis of the novel.

06:40.420 --> 06:43.860
It's like a detective story and Hogan talks about the origins of the idea.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.660
2001 was one of the factors that inspired me to write Inherit the Stars.

06:50.660 --> 06:57.700
I love the idea of something being found, a mystery being uncovered in the course of

06:57.700 --> 07:04.640
lunar exploration that was sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling

07:04.640 --> 07:04.800
it.

07:05.500 --> 07:13.580
It seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to write.

07:14.260 --> 07:18.120
You know, okay, let's have the detective story or the mystery that the detectives are

07:18.120 --> 07:22.240
trying to solve hinge around something that's turned up on the moon.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.780
Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories.

07:29.140 --> 07:34.100
It ought to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller.

07:34.280 --> 07:40.320
So let's make it 50,000 years old and human, which opens up the whole bag of words.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.580
And let's just see how they unravel that.

07:42.580 --> 07:54.360
And I wanted the ending to be a bit of a twist, a bit of a surprise, but nevertheless plausible

07:54.360 --> 07:56.700
and rational within the context of the story.

07:56.800 --> 08:06.060
I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or strange laws of physics or anything like

08:06.060 --> 08:07.460
this to hold it together.

08:08.380 --> 08:13.200
The entire scientific community of Earth starts to work on the baffling problem of the space-suited

08:13.200 --> 08:15.940
50,000-year-old human skeleton, which they name Charlie.

08:16.560 --> 08:21.580
They soon find remnants on the moon of Charlie's culture, a map of an unfamiliar planet, scraps

08:21.580 --> 08:25.520
of Charlie's diary in an unfamiliar language, and some technological artifacts.

08:26.260 --> 08:30.520
With such clues, the scientists begin to piece together the incredible story of who Charlie was

08:30.520 --> 08:31.500
and why he was human.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.960
Hogan says the book sort of defines what science is all about.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.840
It counters some of the distorted images of scientists Hogan has seen in fiction.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.940
Scientists were always eccentric and they wore a color shoes and they drew cabbages

08:44.940 --> 08:48.040
that ate people and they wanted to conquer the world or something.

08:49.160 --> 08:56.920
And there are these cute public impressions of scientists, people who run down the street

08:56.920 --> 08:59.100
with no clothes, not shouting Eureka.

09:05.480 --> 09:15.160
Or you read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on and what came to him

09:15.160 --> 09:18.780
in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20 years.

09:19.520 --> 09:27.340
And real science, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming

09:28.340 --> 09:34.200
bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes, a lot of people doing nothing really

09:34.200 --> 09:40.700
dramatic or exciting, but just meticulously sifting through details, collecting information.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.540
For generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world.

09:45.540 --> 09:52.140
And it's really like putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces

09:52.140 --> 09:53.280
and pushing them around.

09:53.680 --> 09:59.480
Every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.260
And that's a breakthrough.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.760
And so it goes on.

10:02.580 --> 10:05.040
And it really is a detective story.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.900
I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction.

10:08.760 --> 10:13.320
We strongly recommend you read Inherit the Stars to find out the solution to the mystery surrounding Charlie.

10:13.320 --> 10:19.880
Hogan wrote two sequels to Inherit the Stars and all three form a trilogy that presents an awesome view of man's origins.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.740
Next time we'll talk with Hogan about those other two books.

10:29.800 --> 10:35.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:35.380 --> 10:38.260
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:43.320 --> 11:48.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.600
And here are your hosts.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.760
This is David Carson.

11:59.020 --> 11:59.680
And Daryl Lane.

12:00.020 --> 12:04.760
James P. Hogan's science fiction novel Inherit the Stars was popular enough with readers to justify a sequel.

12:05.080 --> 12:05.840
Two of them, in fact.

12:06.220 --> 12:09.860
The first was entitled A Gentle Giants of Ganymede and it was published in 1978.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.120
Hogan explains why he wrote the book.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.500
When I wrote Inherit the Stars, I had three books in mind.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.500
I had a trilogy in mind.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.380
So I put the hooks in...although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself,

12:25.880 --> 12:28.840
it didn't leave the reader hanging.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.860
It started and told and finished a story.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.860
Nevertheless, there were a couple of hooks in there that invited some questions,

12:36.840 --> 12:40.800
which sort of paved the way to a follow-up book.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.820
And my thinking at the time was, I'll go that far,

12:46.940 --> 12:51.880
but I won't write the second book until I have some feedback

12:51.880 --> 12:57.000
as to how the readers liked the first one.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.000
And I got a lot of mail and they all liked it,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.720
and a lot of them said in their letters, will there be a follow-up?

13:02.840 --> 13:03.860
They picked out the hooks.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.180
So I wrote The Gentle Giants.

13:07.060 --> 13:11.600
The Gentle Giants of the title are a race of aliens that first turned up in Inherit the Stars.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.360
In that book, scientists from Earth had discovered a wrecked spaceship on Ganymede,

13:15.980 --> 13:17.420
one of Jupiter's huge moons.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.680
And on it were the remains of prehistoric creatures from Earth, dinosaurs and the like.

13:22.620 --> 13:27.120
In the Gentle Giants of Ganymede, humans meet some live Ganymians who have returned to the solar system

13:27.120 --> 13:31.280
after a mishap in space kept them away for some 25 million years due to time dilation.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.960
It turns out that the Ganymians had been responsible for human evolution.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.580
They'd taken primitive hominids from Earth 25 million years ago

13:38.580 --> 13:40.280
and moved them to a planet called Minerva.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.860
Minerva was then one of the inner planets of our solar system,

13:44.020 --> 13:47.160
but it was destroyed in a tremendous war involving the human stock

13:47.160 --> 13:49.100
that had evolved from the Ganymian experiments.

13:50.220 --> 13:54.060
The second book ends with the Ganymians leaving the solar system in search of their own people,

13:54.420 --> 13:57.920
who migrated from Minerva millions of years before the war that destroyed the planet.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.300
Hogan says readers wanted a third book.

14:01.700 --> 14:07.180
And they wanted another one and I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote it.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.460
And the third one in that series is now written.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.860
It's called Giant Star and it will be, it's a July title.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.160
So it should start to appear in the bookstores around June.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.500
It's the third and last. There won't be any more in that series.

14:22.600 --> 14:27.420
So it ties up a few of the loose ends, tells another story.

14:30.800 --> 14:36.180
It continues with the characters we met in the previous two books,

14:36.340 --> 14:39.780
both the terrestrial and the alien characters, and introduces some new ones.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.860
And I don't think there can be a fourth one, because it really,

14:44.020 --> 14:45.960
I don't think there's any more to be said. It wraps it all up.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.420
Giant Star was published in 1981.

14:53.420 --> 14:57.720
And as Hogan said, it wraps up all the mysteries and loose ends raised in the first two books.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.360
And it presents an absolutely breathtaking concept of man's origins,

15:02.040 --> 15:05.680
explaining also where man gets his curious nature, his aggressiveness,

15:05.960 --> 15:07.840
and his incredible instinct for survival.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.700
Hogan talks about the underlying purpose of the whole trilogy.

15:12.560 --> 15:18.940
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is, or at least as I perceive it.

15:18.940 --> 15:25.020
At the same time, we've added into a story that people who were non-scientists, non-specialists,

15:25.100 --> 15:30.720
would find stimulating and arousing for the curiosity,

15:31.600 --> 15:40.520
even if without trying to turn it into a 250-page lab report or something like that.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.220
And stimulating the books certainly are.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.880
For Shear Granger, the whole Manurvan trilogy, as some have called it,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.640
is matched by a few other works in the field of science fiction.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.240
Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy comes to mind as a comparison,

15:53.700 --> 15:55.380
as does Olaf Stapled inside John.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.400
James B. Hogan's Inherit the Stars, the General Giants of Ganymede, and Giant Star.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.780
Contemporary science fiction has little to offer that's any better.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:13.400 --> 16:16.320
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:16.580 --> 16:19.460
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:03.700 --> 17:07.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:23.320 --> 17:28.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.840
And here are your hosts.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.260
This is Daryl Lane.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.180
And David Carson.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.300
Time travel is one of the traditional themes of science fiction.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.960
One of the best, certainly one of the most realistic time travel books,

17:46.360 --> 17:49.260
is James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time, which came out in 1980.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.800
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a Time,

17:53.840 --> 17:57.080
I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.

17:58.160 --> 18:05.420
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes,

18:05.420 --> 18:11.280
once and for all, and answer them without top-outs,

18:11.660 --> 18:14.480
without convenient coincidences,

18:15.520 --> 18:19.700
and without obliging characters who just happen to do the right thing

18:19.700 --> 18:22.440
to make everything come out the way the author said.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.940
And secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche

18:30.940 --> 18:36.100
of some kind of a conjurer's box, described or described as whatever,

18:36.320 --> 18:39.560
that you jump into and you jump out of and you're in some other time.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.500
We think too many conjurer's boxes, and it seems to me unrealistic.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.300
If I ever build a box like that and I thought it was going to take me to another time,

18:50.840 --> 18:52.960
I certainly wouldn't jump into it and press the button.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.240
I would conduct a long series of tests and experiments first,

18:57.340 --> 18:59.060
and none of that here I was ever thinking to do this.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.560
Hogan wanted to avoid some of the cliches or formulas that characterized most time travel stories.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.180
I think in too many stories, time machines are used like starships.

19:10.320 --> 19:15.680
They're just a device, a vehicle, to get some characters into an unusual environment

19:15.680 --> 19:20.340
and then tell a pretty routine story that would stole them from Greek mythology

19:20.340 --> 19:23.000
or European medieval history.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.860
And the technology doesn't come into the story at all.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.280
They could have gone on a Greyhound bus.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.620
I didn't want to do that.

19:30.100 --> 19:35.280
And so the story was about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon

19:35.280 --> 19:42.420
and had realized that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant,

19:42.640 --> 19:49.540
it meant that they could actually inject information into the past and change the past

19:49.540 --> 19:51.520
with all the questions that implies.

19:53.800 --> 19:59.580
And being proceeded to test this phenomenon

19:59.580 --> 20:02.380
and the pains and very, very strange results.

20:03.380 --> 20:06.720
The strange thing the physicists learn is that they can send messages into the past,

20:06.940 --> 20:08.860
not far into the past, maybe just 10 minutes.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.780
I didn't want it to be a million years or a billion years or

20:14.700 --> 20:19.180
some huge span of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.520
How about a lab bench experiment? 10 minutes.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.960
You can just send a little signal back to yourself 10 minutes ago

20:25.960 --> 20:27.540
and change what you've already done.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.500
This is interesting. You're hard up against the paradoxes now.

20:31.660 --> 20:35.260
You can't find a way around them or duck them.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.200
You've got to answer the question, what happened?

20:38.420 --> 20:42.620
The logic of the whole situation becomes absolutely...

20:43.220 --> 20:46.000
it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out.

20:46.540 --> 20:50.880
It was the logic and the science implied by the time travel theme that fascinated Hogan.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.580
He wanted to approach the concept realistically.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.400
And it's so realistic that you feel after reading the book,

20:56.680 --> 20:59.760
you could go down to Radio Shack and buy the parts to make a time travel machine.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.240
Recently a number of responsible scientists have been speculating

21:03.240 --> 21:05.320
on the actual possibility of time travel.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.340
We asked Hogan if he thought it would ever be a reality

21:08.340 --> 21:10.140
and if his book was meant to be prophetic.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.300
Well, I don't know whether it's prophetic or not.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.580
As it's elaborated in the book itself,

21:17.380 --> 21:20.820
if something like that ever became a fact,

21:21.080 --> 21:24.020
there are some pretty interesting problems that are going to have to be solved.

21:25.020 --> 21:28.600
And our ideas of logic and cause and effect

21:28.600 --> 21:31.980
are going to have to undergo some pretty interesting revisions.

21:32.300 --> 21:36.440
So I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet and saying, yes, it'll happen.

21:37.720 --> 21:38.780
Maybe, I don't know.

21:38.860 --> 21:43.220
I think history has shown that impossible or it'll never happen

21:43.220 --> 21:45.920
are very dangerous phrases to use in any context.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.520
More of James P. Hogan next time.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.920
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:00.920 --> 22:04.100
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.380
Thank you.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.480
The Science Fiction Radio Show

22:52.480 --> 22:52.680
is a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:52.680 --> 22:53.740
Stay with us.

23:09.540 --> 23:11.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:12.300 --> 23:14.640
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:17.420 --> 23:18.960
And here are your hosts.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.280
This is David Carson. And Darrell Lane.

23:25.660 --> 23:27.480
Of all science fiction writers working today,

23:27.980 --> 23:31.380
no one surpasses James P. Hogan in scientific accuracy and realism.

23:31.380 --> 23:36.260
Hogan's publisher, Ballantine Books, has advertised him as the man who puts science back in science fiction.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.280
And after reading books like Thrice Upon a Time and The Two Faces of Tomorrow,

23:40.460 --> 23:42.280
you realize how much he deserves that description.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.460
Hogan is also concerned with realism.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.180
With the kind of everyday detail that makes his story, even though it's set in the future,

23:48.340 --> 23:49.420
a totally believable one.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.020
He explains why realistic detail is important.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.560
I think these kinds of details do matter because

23:55.560 --> 24:01.720
if we're putting a story into a futuristic setting,

24:03.480 --> 24:04.280
I think the

24:06.600 --> 24:10.780
little details of background, such as if the guy needs to make a phone tour,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.460
how does he go about it if he needs to render a cab,

24:14.580 --> 24:18.460
these matter because if the story is being told in the future,

24:18.860 --> 24:22.700
the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic.

24:25.120 --> 24:29.680
I've come across a number of instances, which in my opinion are a little flawed,

24:29.820 --> 24:33.000
because I've dealt with an AW.

24:35.540 --> 24:39.560
A writer may have seized on a particular thought,

24:39.780 --> 24:44.520
maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or whatever,

24:45.160 --> 24:48.240
developed that very well, but kind of gets hung up on it.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.980
In the background, everything else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980.

24:57.120 --> 25:02.060
Trying to stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to think about a situation,

25:02.320 --> 25:05.640
the guy's going to make a phone call, just like stop and think how he might make that,

25:07.540 --> 25:09.640
and think about it for five minutes,

25:09.920 --> 25:16.500
and then maybe show it in a way different to what would have been

25:16.500 --> 25:19.620
the positive thing to do in the first couple of seconds.

25:28.260 --> 25:32.380
Hogan says that his readers appreciate his attention to realistic detail and accuracy.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.780
In fact, he thinks he attracts some readers who don't normally read science fiction because of it.

25:37.940 --> 25:42.000
From the people who write to me and the people that I meet,

25:42.980 --> 25:49.260
one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that

25:49.260 --> 25:56.860
it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader,

25:56.860 --> 26:00.480
who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstore.

26:01.700 --> 26:10.140
But a lot of, I suppose, people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s,

26:10.140 --> 26:16.680
in all manner of professions, not necessarily to do with the scientists, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth,

26:18.060 --> 26:25.240
who typically would say, gee, I used to read science fiction when I was at college or when I was at university,

26:25.240 --> 26:27.180
but I kind of grew out of it.

26:28.300 --> 26:33.800
I can't relate to the way out galaxies like years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns.

26:34.340 --> 26:39.880
Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet.

26:40.860 --> 26:46.980
But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe

26:46.980 --> 26:50.720
a million years from now, but maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years.

26:51.380 --> 26:57.600
And they find names in the book like IBM, Avis, Boeing, familiar places.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.460
And it kind of grabs them.

27:00.460 --> 27:05.860
I say, well, this I can relate to, it's the world that I live in just stretched a little bit.

27:06.060 --> 27:10.900
The connection is not broken, the economics and the politics have evolved from what I read in the papers.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.440
I can still see the connections.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.340
And it could be the world my kids go up in. And I like it.

27:17.360 --> 27:21.540
Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from yesteryear, is further in the future than his other books.

27:21.720 --> 27:25.200
And the field of action is much broader, but it's typically Hogan and his credibility.

27:25.200 --> 27:30.160
If you haven't been exposed to James P. Hogan's brand of science fiction, you're missing something.

27:37.320 --> 27:42.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

27:42.660 --> 27:45.820
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
