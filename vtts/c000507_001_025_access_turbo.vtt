Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.980
And here are your hosts.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.880
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.420
Marion Zimmer Bradley has had a long and successful career as a writer of science fiction and fantasy.

00:51.640 --> 00:58.400
She began publishing professionally in 1953, some 30 years ago, but she had been writing long before that even.

00:59.160 --> 01:03.580
Well, I'm told that I started dictating poems to my mother before I could print,

01:03.760 --> 01:07.060
but it's true that I've been writing for school papers and things.

01:07.060 --> 01:14.260
I started making up stories, poems, and songs since, well, it was well before I entered school.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.420
But I didn't start writing with any connected ambition until I was about 12 or 13.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.120
Like many other present-day science fiction authors,

01:24.120 --> 01:28.620
Bradley was introduced to the field through the pulp magazines in the golden age of science fiction.

01:30.140 --> 01:34.060
Well, when I was a child, I thought that if I wanted to grow up and be a writer,

01:34.240 --> 01:38.540
I would probably write historical fiction because that was what I liked best at that time.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.540
Although I always loved things like writer Haggard,

01:41.620 --> 01:45.300
but they were in such old books that I decided they weren't being published anymore.

01:46.100 --> 01:53.320
Then when I discovered the pulp magazines, Astounding, Thrilling Wonder, that sort of thing,

01:53.460 --> 01:59.040
and I saw the fan magazines in the back, the fanzines and the letters from fans,

01:59.280 --> 02:03.160
I thought, my goodness, there are other people who like this sort of thing.

02:03.260 --> 02:07.020
And all of a sudden, I realized not only that I wanted to write for a living,

02:07.060 --> 02:09.980
but that I wanted to write science fiction and fantasy.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.660
Bradley is high on the value of science fiction and believes it can be of benefit to anyone.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.960
People are always asking me why I write science fiction when there are so many other things

02:20.960 --> 02:23.060
or why I'm not into mainstream fiction.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.560
And I have written mainstream novels.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.680
But my feeling is that science fiction is a very, and fantasy, of course,

02:29.760 --> 02:34.840
is a very valuable genre because it forces people to think.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.640
You can't just, oh, I suppose you can in the slam-bang action stuff.

02:39.980 --> 02:45.280
But even in those, there is a residue of what if the world were different than it is now?

02:45.680 --> 02:52.900
People in our society and in our schools are supposed to keep tight to reality

02:52.900 --> 02:57.860
and not imagine things and don't be so imaginative.

02:58.060 --> 03:02.540
And I think imagination is the one great thing that distinguishes us from the beasts.

03:02.540 --> 03:07.040
And science fiction is a very valuable corrective to modern education

03:07.040 --> 03:11.760
because it makes people think and it forces them to stretch their imaginations,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.880
which gets sort of atrophied in the average school.

03:15.740 --> 03:19.760
Much of Bradley's work deals with parapsychology, telepathy, ESP,

03:20.120 --> 03:21.520
things having to do with the occult.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.460
We ask her why these topics interested her so much.

03:24.460 --> 03:31.620
Well, possibly because, as I said before, I began my reading with such people as Ryder Haggard,

03:32.360 --> 03:41.520
Merritt, Andrew Lang, Yeats, the Dunsany people, the serious fantasy writers,

03:41.580 --> 03:45.380
and they, of course, were all roughly connected, which I found out later,

03:45.580 --> 03:49.280
to the Golden Dawn Order, the magical order in England.

03:50.400 --> 03:55.300
Also, there was a lot of, there's a lot of history.

03:55.740 --> 03:58.900
Fantasy sort of comes out of occultism, as it were,

03:59.680 --> 04:03.920
what's now called the neo-pagan religions, but, of course, they didn't exist at that time.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.380
So I thought I was the only person interested in these things.

04:07.820 --> 04:11.140
And when I got into Haggard, Mundy, people like that,

04:11.260 --> 04:15.340
I realized this is, this is what I was looking for.

04:15.340 --> 04:18.580
There are a lot of people, I think, who look in science fiction and fantasy

04:18.580 --> 04:22.080
for validation of the fact that there are other things in life

04:22.080 --> 04:26.400
than, than you might say, the mundane round and materialism.

04:27.020 --> 04:30.180
And those of us who can't get into conventional religion,

04:30.380 --> 04:33.460
which I've never been able to do for various and sundry reasons,

04:35.140 --> 04:40.440
we use that, I think, as a way of looking for what was real in religion

04:40.440 --> 04:44.980
behind the dogma and behind the, all the nonsense and hellfire.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.920
Bradley has published around 50 novels so far,

04:48.040 --> 04:51.820
in addition to numerous short stories, essays, and various other literary projects.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.580
Not all of her novels have been science fiction or fantasy.

04:54.860 --> 04:57.740
Most of the ones that are concern the planet Darkover,

04:58.040 --> 04:59.460
her most popular creation.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.740
There are some 15 novels in the Darkover series presently,

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
and the list is still growing.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.840
Next time, we'll talk to Bradley about her Darkover series.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:16.900 --> 05:19.700
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:19.960 --> 05:23.020
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

06:11.400 --> 06:12.520
so stay with us.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

06:31.280 --> 06:34.120
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.580
And here are your hosts.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.780
This is Bill Vernon.

06:45.040 --> 06:45.640
And Daryl Lane.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.920
Among the most popular of science fiction stories

06:47.920 --> 06:50.940
would have to be the Darkover stories of Marion Zimmer Bradley.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.420
The series would have to be considered as one of the most enduring, too.

06:54.900 --> 06:58.160
So far, it numbers some 15 novels and two collections of short stories,

06:58.220 --> 06:59.500
and more novels are on the way.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.820
Darkover is a planet.

07:01.140 --> 07:04.380
It circles a red sun, which gives it a rich, dusky atmosphere.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.080
The highest culture on Darkover consists of descendants of humans

07:08.080 --> 07:10.340
who crash-landed on the planet many centuries before.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.360
And they've developed telepathic powers.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.580
Their whole culture is based on the use of these mental powers,

07:15.640 --> 07:17.020
rather than on technology.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.740
Humans from Earth eventually rediscover Darkover,

07:19.820 --> 07:21.560
and there is a conflict between the two cultures.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.480
The technological emphasis of Earth and its empire

07:24.480 --> 07:28.120
versus the slower, provincial, almost futile society of the Darkoverans,

07:28.180 --> 07:29.260
which is based on telepathy.

07:29.260 --> 07:32.400
Even though the novels and stories of Darkover are related,

07:32.840 --> 07:34.680
Bradley did not consider them as a series

07:34.680 --> 07:36.540
when she started writing about Darkover.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.580
I started trying to do that around the time I wrote Forbidden Tower.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.920
Originally, no.

07:44.520 --> 07:48.280
I had a feeling, and other writers told me rather cynically,

07:48.520 --> 07:52.240
that the life of a paperback book was about five or six months,

07:52.240 --> 07:57.720
that nobody, and so I assumed, I realized it was not safe to assume

07:57.720 --> 08:02.460
that anyone who read any of my books had ever read a previous book

08:02.460 --> 08:04.520
or would ever read another book by me.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.400
So I worked very hard to make each book stand on its own feet

08:08.400 --> 08:11.140
and not assume any knowledge of previous books.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.640
We asked her if she considered each Darkover story

08:14.640 --> 08:17.320
as a separate creation and not part of a consistent whole.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.360
That's right.

08:19.460 --> 08:23.900
I try very hard to make each book have its own internal consistency and logic,

08:24.400 --> 08:26.820
but if the books don't jibe with one another,

08:27.020 --> 08:30.300
then the readers are just going to have to use their own imagination

08:30.300 --> 08:31.640
to fill in the gaps.

08:32.420 --> 08:35.400
She explains why she writes so often about Darkover.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.200
Well, it started originally from laziness.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.280
I was going to college, putting myself through college,

08:42.280 --> 08:45.860
and then later she was supporting a sick husband

08:45.860 --> 08:48.480
and a couple of children when I married for the second time,

08:49.020 --> 08:52.420
and my husband was quite ill and couldn't work much,

08:52.500 --> 08:55.080
and the babies were still in diapers,

08:55.120 --> 08:58.120
and it was the only job I could take that would let me stay home

08:58.120 --> 08:59.120
and look after them,

08:59.600 --> 09:03.160
because, well, it was really too ill even to cope with that.

09:03.180 --> 09:07.220
So I figured if I could sell books while I was putting myself through college,

09:07.220 --> 09:09.960
I could certainly do it while I was home looking after the kids.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.040
And so I started writing,

09:13.780 --> 09:17.080
and when you have a nice setting and background,

09:17.440 --> 09:20.500
which is as fully worked out as Darkover was for me,

09:21.080 --> 09:22.820
well, you tend to go back to it

09:22.820 --> 09:25.140
rather than trying to invent a whole new world,

09:25.140 --> 09:26.720
partly because it's easier

09:26.720 --> 09:28.740
and partly because you realize you haven't...

09:28.740 --> 09:30.480
The books are tailored to...

09:30.480 --> 09:32.440
In those days, the books were tailored

09:32.440 --> 09:36.040
to such close commercial restrictions about length and so forth

09:36.040 --> 09:39.980
that I realized every time that I'd had to cut out so much

09:39.980 --> 09:41.560
from my own thinking about the book

09:41.560 --> 09:44.420
that what I'd cut out would make a sizable new book,

09:44.420 --> 09:46.620
and it was a lot simpler.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.700
I figured that since people would read lots of books about Tarzan

09:50.700 --> 09:53.680
or Perry Mason or Nero Wolfe or whatever,

09:54.060 --> 09:57.660
people evidently liked reading about stories with the same background.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.920
It was easier to write them

09:58.920 --> 10:01.220
than to invent a whole new universe for each book.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.220
That is, as I say, at the beginning, it was laziness.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.580
Then later, I wanted to give up the whole thing

10:10.580 --> 10:13.000
because I thought people must be getting tired of it.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.260
And I told Don Wollheim this, and he said,

10:16.340 --> 10:18.720
Oh, no, people are always asking

10:18.720 --> 10:21.120
when is there going to be another book about Darkover?

10:21.280 --> 10:25.000
And so I decided, good heavens, if it really is a series,

10:25.300 --> 10:27.920
maybe I ought to start thinking of it as a series

10:27.920 --> 10:29.560
and take it seriously that way.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.080
The first Darkover novel, The Sword of Aldonis,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.340
was published in 1962.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.040
The latest, Hawk Mistress, was released recently in paperback.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.200
Bradley has signed a contract for two more Darkover novels,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.820
so the series will be growing in the coming years.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.520
Science fiction readers will be delighted at that news.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.420
We'll continue our discussion with Marion Zimmer Bradley next time.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

11:09.440 --> 11:12.220
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:12.500 --> 11:15.540
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

12:01.380 --> 12:02.440
so stay with us.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

12:21.420 --> 12:24.060
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.520
And here are your hosts.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.100
This is Daryl Lane.

12:34.200 --> 12:34.900
And Bill Vernon.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.020
Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover stories are based on one overall conflict,

12:39.020 --> 12:43.720
the technological might of Earth versus the telepathic powers of the inhabitants of Darkover.

12:43.860 --> 12:51.280
The planet Darkover, circling a blood-red sun, contains valuable crystals which greatly magnify and concentrate telepathic ability.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.320
These crystals are the basis of the Darkover civilization.

12:54.820 --> 12:59.100
Earth wants access to the crystals, and it wants Darkover as part of its interstellar empire.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.720
But the Darkover's resist.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.780
The conflict never really breaks into a full-scale interplanetary war,

13:04.980 --> 13:09.580
but the tension leads to all sorts of intrigues, skirmishes, and spying activities.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.480
Relying on their mental powers is the Darkover's do.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.280
They've never developed a technology.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.440
In fact, they often seem anti-technological, though Bradley says this is not the case.

13:18.440 --> 13:26.720
I don't think so much anti-technological as thinking that perhaps there are better ways to do things than by technology.

13:27.040 --> 13:36.400
It isn't so much anti-technological as a concept that possibly the same kind of technology does not fit every planet,

13:36.620 --> 13:39.800
just as materialism does not fit every human mind,

13:39.920 --> 13:45.200
that there are different universes for different mental sets, as you said.

13:45.200 --> 13:50.020
I think I'm a very sort of alternative culture person myself,

13:50.480 --> 13:57.280
and from the time I was a child I have never liked the idea that everybody has to fit into the same lockstep

13:57.280 --> 14:00.060
and be, well, they now say be clones.

14:00.320 --> 14:06.380
My daughter calls the ordinary kids at school who never think of anything except football games clones.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.780
Well, I felt that way when I was a youngster,

14:09.840 --> 14:14.840
and so I suppose the idea of leaving open options and choices for everybody

14:14.840 --> 14:17.740
so they can find the kind of lifestyle that suits them best

14:17.740 --> 14:22.560
instead of blamly assuming that everybody has to belong to the same lifestyle.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.640
That was something that I felt very strongly about when I was a kid,

14:25.640 --> 14:28.680
and I feel even more strongly about than I did when I was 15.

14:29.800 --> 14:34.560
Bradley seems to be fairly even-handed in presenting the conflict between Darkover and Earth,

14:34.700 --> 14:39.860
but she also has sympathy for Darkover's position and even seems to admire its way of life.

14:39.860 --> 14:45.060
We asked her if it would be fair to say that she tends to be slightly on the side of non-technological Darkover.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.400
No, I would not. My very life is dependent on technology.

14:49.980 --> 14:54.800
I am myself a diabetic and dependent upon medical preparations,

14:54.840 --> 14:59.060
which are very difficult to get in an anti-techno or a non-technological culture.

14:59.060 --> 15:08.760
It is simply that I do what you call an even-handed job because, well, my husband says it's because I'm a Gemini,

15:08.760 --> 15:13.180
and it's true that I am cursed with seeing two sides of everything.

15:13.460 --> 15:18.040
When I was a kid and reading in school about what a terrible person Benedict Arnold was,

15:18.040 --> 15:20.800
I still realized that to the British he was a hero,

15:20.800 --> 15:23.800
and it suddenly occurred to me that the villain is always,

15:24.080 --> 15:29.720
except for real criminals like mass murderers, rapists, that sort of thing,

15:29.880 --> 15:35.240
almost every, quote, villain, unquote, is just the victim of a political conflict.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.240
He's the hero of the other side.

15:38.380 --> 15:42.660
One thing, though, that Bradley admires in the Darkover society is the compact.

15:43.080 --> 15:47.280
The compact outlaws guns, explosives, or energy weapons of any kind.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.340
Any fighting must be done with swords, knives, bows and arrows, and so forth.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.100
In this day and age with nuclear weapons every place,

15:55.240 --> 15:58.600
I think every human being has to be in sympathy with the compact,

15:58.860 --> 16:01.000
or if they aren't, there's something wrong with their brains.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.260
At least under the compact, if you have only a sword or a knife,

16:05.280 --> 16:09.120
you can do only one person's amount of damage.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.660
I suppose it's my emotional reaction to the fact that when I was 15 years old,

16:13.660 --> 16:16.900
it became possible to wipe out all human life on Earth

16:16.900 --> 16:20.620
if one paranoid politician presses the wrong button.

16:21.740 --> 16:24.020
And I think maybe that's too much power

16:24.020 --> 16:29.440
and would like to see power back in the hands of individuals over their own lives.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.620
I don't like the idea that we are all, you might say,

16:33.760 --> 16:38.180
hostages in a monstrous political and ideological conflict.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.260
I can't believe that God is on one side

16:42.940 --> 16:45.440
and that on the other there is only the devil.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.540
On our next show, we'll discuss one of Bradley's Darkover novels,

16:49.760 --> 16:50.600
The Shattered Chain.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.460
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:03.460 --> 17:06.760
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:58.540 --> 18:01.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:01.380 --> 18:02.480
so stay with us.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:21.060 --> 18:23.840
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.240
And here are your hosts.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.080
This is Bill Vernon.

18:34.280 --> 18:34.900
And Daryl Lane.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.940
The Shattered Chain is one of the 15 science fiction novels

18:37.940 --> 18:41.760
that presently make up Marion Zimmer Bradley's series about the planet Darkover.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.820
The novel deals with one of the basic problems or dilemmas of the Darkover society,

18:46.060 --> 18:46.940
the position of women.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.840
And in doing that, the book also confronts the same issue in our society today.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.620
It treats the role of women in a sensitive, understanding manner.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.580
The novel follows three women.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.320
Lady Rohana, a noble Darkoven with children.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.760
Jaelle, the leader of a band of free Amazon warrior women.

19:03.060 --> 19:06.260
And Magda, an earth woman who becomes involved with the free Amazons.

19:06.420 --> 19:10.940
The free Amazons are a sisterhood of Darkoven women who have dropped out of normal society.

19:11.180 --> 19:15.100
They order their lives with the principles contained in the Oath of the Free Amazons.

19:15.380 --> 19:20.640
The idea behind the oath is total freedom, both physically and emotionally, from a male-dominated culture.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.500
The oath has been admired by women's liberation readers.

19:23.820 --> 19:26.340
We asked Bradley what the impetus behind it was.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.920
As a matter of fact, it was sort of spontaneous.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.720
I was writing along in the story and I hadn't the slightest idea what was going to happen

19:34.720 --> 19:36.880
until Magda ran into the free Amazons.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.900
And I thought, well, what would they do to her?

19:39.080 --> 19:42.380
They certainly wouldn't kill her because they're peaceful people.

19:42.540 --> 19:47.780
And then it suddenly occurred to me that the penalty for passing yourself off as an Amazon

19:47.780 --> 19:52.820
might be to be forced into actually observing the laws.

19:53.920 --> 20:04.080
And so also it was in a way a literary device to get Magda among them to explore it from the heroine's eye.

20:04.460 --> 20:09.540
But I found myself suddenly just writing down the oath.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.120
I didn't figure it out beforehand.

20:11.120 --> 20:16.100
I just said, now what would this group of people demand of people who came among them

20:16.100 --> 20:18.040
and that sort of just poured out?

20:19.160 --> 20:22.000
Both Magda and Lady Rohana admire the free Amazons.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.940
Magda, in fact, chooses to become one.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.400
But Rohana remains a normal, Darkoven woman.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.320
She stays with her husband and children.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.860
And though she sympathizes with the free Amazon, she speaks for the traditional woman's role.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.200
We asked Bradley if she sympathized with Rohana.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.500
Of course I do, because I lived in a world where these restrictions became part of our lives.

20:42.760 --> 20:51.000
And a lot of, for instance, very liberated women, I would like very much to join them in many ways.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.780
But having taken on responsibilities, my kids are here.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.800
I can't just...

20:56.800 --> 20:59.040
You can't divorce your children.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.760
You can't take back the commitments you've made.

21:02.760 --> 21:07.600
But it's also true that this kind of freedom is not for everybody.

21:07.860 --> 21:13.260
I, for instance, would absolutely love to sail single-handed around the world or climb Mount Everest.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.780
But I had children until I was too old to do so.

21:17.560 --> 21:21.340
And nowadays, there is really no great reason for me to...

21:21.340 --> 21:24.660
No great reason for me to strike out and do this.

21:24.700 --> 21:31.000
I have a great deal of sympathy and admiration for people who can do these things.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.860
But I can't.

21:32.080 --> 21:36.140
Just as I think Rohana had a great deal of admiration for the free Amazons,

21:36.500 --> 21:41.160
her attitude is, well, if I had known about this kind of thing when I was a young girl,

21:41.320 --> 21:46.740
instead of just believing all sorts of lies about them, I probably would have been one too.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.960
But it's too late for that.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.460
And I had another...

21:49.460 --> 21:52.440
You might say that God had meant something else for me.

21:53.380 --> 21:57.460
But Bradley also presents the free Amazons with compassion and understanding.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.300
She tells us why they're important.

21:59.860 --> 22:09.720
I think the free Amazons were created out of my wish to realize that in a society so abnormally restrictive,

22:09.740 --> 22:13.620
there must be some kind of a safety valve that a society would blow to pieces.

22:13.620 --> 22:19.440
So there had to be some kind of an honorable alternative provided in the society for women,

22:19.660 --> 22:24.000
and for that matter for men, who simply could not live under the pressures of that kind of society.

22:24.940 --> 22:29.000
We thought that feminist readers of The Shattered Chain would be pleased at the free Amazons

22:29.000 --> 22:30.700
in the way Bradley treats women in the novel.

22:30.820 --> 22:32.220
But Bradley says that isn't so.

22:32.220 --> 22:40.920
As a matter of fact, the real heavy feminists believe that I'm sort of a pussycat, a Mickey Mouse,

22:40.980 --> 22:45.240
because I don't go far enough in men-hating.

22:45.420 --> 22:49.580
They said I didn't have the courage to go far enough and create a society

22:49.580 --> 22:53.400
where men had actually been eliminated, a true feminist society.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.760
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

23:06.040 --> 23:09.020
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:54.120 --> 23:58.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:14.180 --> 24:16.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

24:16.900 --> 24:19.480
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:22.260 --> 24:23.900
And here are your hosts.

24:27.940 --> 24:29.220
This is Daryl Lane.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.020
And Bill Vernon.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.360
Marion Zimmer Bradley is one of science fiction's most distinguished writers.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.480
She's been publishing science fiction and fantasy for 30 years,

24:36.480 --> 24:39.800
and her Darkover novels have attracted a large following of readers.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.600
Today, there are a large number of first-class women writers in the field of science fiction.

24:43.760 --> 24:47.120
But when Bradley began publishing in the early 1950s, there weren't many around.

24:47.340 --> 24:51.140
In looking over a list of science fiction authors from the 40s and 50s, in fact,

24:51.320 --> 24:53.680
it's hard to find more than a couple of women writers.

24:53.680 --> 24:58.920
Well, there were a few more, although not really in the science fiction field.

24:59.140 --> 25:04.020
I, of course, have always been fonder of fantasy, and there were a great many women in that.

25:04.600 --> 25:11.540
Weird Tales was edited for many, many years by a woman, Dorothy McIlwraith.

25:12.400 --> 25:17.360
Famous Fantastic Mysteries was edited by Mary Gnaedinger.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.860
There were a great many women in fantasy.

25:19.860 --> 25:25.460
It was just hard science fiction, which appealed mostly to young men and to engineering students,

25:25.540 --> 25:30.340
or so the editors fondly believed, where women were short of taboo.

25:30.340 --> 25:36.100
It was like the audience was supposed to be young white males,

25:36.240 --> 25:39.580
and so it was like the audience for Western stories.

25:40.180 --> 25:46.120
B.M. Bauer, Bertha Bauer, had to call herself just B.M. Bauer

25:46.120 --> 25:50.840
because they believed that the young cowboys who read the stuff

25:50.840 --> 25:53.940
would not be willing to read stuff by a person named Bertha,

25:53.940 --> 25:56.760
which sounded like a little old lady knitting socks.

25:57.980 --> 26:01.940
But she was one of the very best of Western writers,

26:02.080 --> 26:04.980
and eventually they were able to cope with it and let her be so.

26:06.020 --> 26:09.360
Bradley believes science fiction has changed in the time she's been in the field,

26:09.400 --> 26:12.560
and she thinks women writers have been partially responsible for the changes.

26:12.820 --> 26:15.360
We ask her what she thought some of the changes have been.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.780
Well, part of it is when I started writing it,

26:20.880 --> 26:26.640
it was, once again, it was sort of technological daydreams for young engineering students.

26:26.760 --> 26:33.860
It was a lot about spaceships and journeys to the moon and the conquest of stars

26:33.860 --> 26:36.240
and gadgets and all that sort of thing.

26:37.540 --> 26:43.980
In the middle 40s, the work of Theodore Sturgeon and, even more, the work of the Kuttner pair,

26:44.160 --> 26:50.500
and anybody who has read the books very seriously knows that Catherine was the dominant writer of that pair.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.360
C.L. Moore wrote a lot of the stuff with the Kuttner pen name on it,

26:55.420 --> 26:59.080
because, once again, the audience was supposed to be mostly male,

26:59.260 --> 27:04.680
and the two of them were working so closely together that they never cared who wrote a specific story.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.260
It was all just Kuttner and Moore.

27:07.240 --> 27:11.040
But a lot of the stories that appeared with Hank's name on it were Kuttner's.

27:11.040 --> 27:18.400
And Catherine, like many women, is more interested in the effects of gadgets on people than she was in gadgets,

27:18.540 --> 27:21.540
and she almost single-handed reformed the whole field.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.800
There was a time during the 40s and early 50s when the Kuttners,

27:26.000 --> 27:32.840
when the two Kuttners wrote almost everything that appeared in the big magazines under a variety of pen names.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.940
They'd have three or four stories in an issue sometimes.

27:35.940 --> 27:44.940
And so, gradually, also because Hank and Catherine were both preparing to work with psychology,

27:44.940 --> 27:47.940
they were both studying to be psychotherapists,

27:48.640 --> 27:51.840
they became very interested in the causes of people's behavior.

27:52.180 --> 27:55.720
This increased importance of behavior or psychology in science fiction,

27:55.940 --> 27:58.500
which Bradley credits C.L. Moore with helping bring about,

27:58.720 --> 28:01.160
also helps explain the popularity of fantasy today.

28:01.900 --> 28:08.220
I think the big change has been away from technology itself

28:08.220 --> 28:11.560
and into the effect which technology has on people.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.220
And then when you start delving into people's minds,

28:14.240 --> 28:19.820
what you come to is fantasy under which they cloak their deepest feelings and desires.

28:20.220 --> 28:25.100
You might say the very depths of their unconscious where nothing is censored.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.840
Fantasy is, you might say, the subconscious with the sensor off,

28:30.580 --> 28:32.620
turned off, or the self-censor turned off.

28:33.640 --> 28:38.040
Bradley's own fiction is strong in characterization and in realistic human psychology.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.320
The people she creates are always believable and deep.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.320
But that doesn't mean her narratives are slow.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.980
She writes exciting science fiction.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.700
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:57.700 --> 29:00.960
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
