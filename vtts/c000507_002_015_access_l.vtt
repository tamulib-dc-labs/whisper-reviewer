WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:03.895
Let me get things cranked up here. Yeah. What do you want to tell me? What you going to ask me? Yeah. That makes no 
difference though. Okay. Um, basically, uh, how long have you been living in Cross Plains? I've been living in Cross

00:18.392 --> 00:19.874
Plains. I've lived here since 1922. Uh, that would be about, uh, good Lord. That's a while in it. Yeah. Uh, I was a boy here 
and, uh, went to college and came back, took over the newspaper, got out of college one day and took over the newspaper,

00:32.819 --> 00:38.024
hit the next one. Been here all the while. I retired in the newspaper about eight or nine years ago. When did you first meet 
Mr. Howard? When did I first meet him? Well, as a boy, I knew him here. When he was a boy, Howard would be about, Howard's

00:52.857 --> 00:59.343
about four or five years old or nine, four years I guess. I guess he'd be about, I'm 70 years old. I would be about 74 or 5 now, 
I think. Okay. I could check that out for you, but possibly you got that information at hand. Yes. When did you... I knew

01:14.860 --> 01:22.188
him at...

01:14.860 --> 01:22.188
I started to high school. Let's see. I came in here, moved here from a nearby town and entered high school as about a 
sophomore. And those days we only had ten grades here and they were not affiliated. But Howard went down to Brownwood to

01:36.844 --> 01:44.392
finish his high school work in order to be qualified, you know, to enter college.

01:48.536 --> 01:58.846
When you came back to Cross Plains after going to college and you started over the newspaper, that was in July, I took over 
the newspaper in July 1930. Howard was here at the time. He was a young man, I was 20 years old and Howard must have been 24 or

02:02.425 --> 02:07.812
5. He was writing for a bunch of pulp magazines, just getting started. And very few people remember the names of those 
magazines, but it was Stone Street and Smith. They published a number of magazines, like Weird Tales.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.605
Weird Tales was one of them, I believe. Boxing in the west, the wild west, and a whole lot of stuff like that. He mainly 
wrote for weird tales, but he also occasionally wrote for... He's either a ring or something. He occasionally wrote for

02:43.786 --> 02:46.128
a boxing magazine, too. Yeah, we were talking to Ms. Laughlin. She said sometimes he would go down the streets there 
shadow boxing and sort of doing a little... Yeah, I imagine that's more or less exaggerated. Hard was a little on... a

03:01.015 --> 03:03.157
little on the outside. He wasn't in them, but it was very many people. He was rather aloof. But he was a big, robust man. To 
me, he was a combination of Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London, if you can imagine that two together. Yeah, he had those books

03:17.551 --> 03:21.214
in his library, so I can imagine that pretty well. He was very robust, like Jack London. 

03:26.460 --> 03:32.840
He was a majestine. A majestine. A majestine like Poe,

03:32.840 --> 03:35.300
and once he wrote a few poems, maybe

03:35.300 --> 03:38.480
you're familiar with the one called The Temptress.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.940
The Temptor. He wrote a very good...

03:42.940 --> 03:46.700
It reminds you of Poe's Raven, something, the meter of it, something like that.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.220
In that he compares the Temptor as a beautiful

03:52.680 --> 03:55.140
maiden who lures him. Her name

03:55.140 --> 03:58.900
is Suicide. Yeah, I do believe I have read that one.

03:59.327 --> 04:10.708
Yeah, I'm sure you've read it. We're very many people on cross planes aware that Howard was a writer or I guess... Oh, 
they all knew it. I published in the newspaper, you know, there wasn't a lot. I'd say that Robert Howard had a story this

04:10.708 --> 04:25.103
week and Weird Tales or some of those pop magazines, yeah, they knew it. Yeah, yeah, I take it being a small town, I guess, 
just about everybody knew everything else. Oh, yeah, that's right. And his dad, he was a doctor here, a country doctor,

04:25.103 --> 04:47.678
general practitioner, well thought of, very popular. And his father was proud of the fact that his son was a gifted 
writer. He talked about it. Yeah.

04:47.678 --> 05:00.858
Well, let's see. I'm about to run through my gambit of questions here. Was there anything Any particular stories you 
know about Mr. Howard being that you were a newspaper man and everything? He might have had some exploits out there. I

05:00.858 --> 05:07.506
remember the morning he killed himself very well. I

05:07.506 --> 05:22.782
can't think just what it was. I know it was a warm season of the year, it must have been summer. But anyway, early in the 
summer, 10, 11 o'clock in the morning, I heard on the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself when I immediately

05:22.782 --> 05:45.585
jumped in my car and ran down there and got down there and a few neighbors had gathered. It wasn't generally known over 
town, but the old justice of the peace was standing there on the gallery, the front porch. When I walked up, he called and

05:45.585 --> 05:58.257
said, come here, Jack. And I stepped up there and he took me into the bedroom and he He pointed to an old Underwood top rider 
who had the four lines written on it there. And Howard had, when he had been told that his mother wouldn't live throughout

05:58.257 --> 06:22.762
the day, he went to this top rider, wrote these four lines, walked outside, sat down his car and shot his head off. And this 
old JP asked me what these four lines meant. They said, I'm sure you've read them, All fled all done, so let me on the pyre.

06:22.762 --> 06:24.965
The feast is over, the lamps expire.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.252
Yeah, we have read that, that's all. I'm sure you've read that. To me, I've been told since then by Sprague de Camp that the 
lines are not entirely original, but they were certainly original as far as I'd ever heard, or anybody else I've ever

06:30.914 --> 06:58.089
talked to except Sprague de Camp. Yeah, I imagine that's... was Howard's way of putting it. Yeah, that was his. That was 
his melodic dream. Yeah. His finale.

06:58.089 --> 07:09.745
Well, Mr. Scott, I can't think of anything else. Can you think of any other bold thing? I'll tell you, you've got a son over 
there in Odessa. I'll tell you, a young man there, an Odessa. You can pick up on the telephone and call him and knew him. His

07:09.745 --> 07:29.970
name is Jay Browne B-A-U-M Baum. He's a man he's 70 years old. He's just my age. Uh, as a boy, he knew Robert Howard. His 
name is Jay Baum. Jay. Browne. B-R-O-W-N-E. Browne. B-A-U-M. His son is a, his son is a loan officer and one of the, uh, one of

07:29.970 --> 07:49.088
the, uh, one of the, uh, one of those things out there. I don't know which one. Okay, I'll see if I can track him down too.

07:49.088 --> 08:04.252
We talked with Charlotte Laughlin and some other people in Brownwood who were doing some research on the show. Have you 
talked to CF Borg? No sir, we talked to Jack Scott. Yeah, I know Jack. They're in Cross Plains and he referred us to you and

08:04.252 --> 08:24.716
your brother. And what we're mainly just looking for are just some O's and some Interesting stories or any reminisces 
you might have about Mr. Howard? Well, yes, I'd be glad to tell you what I know about him. I try to think of some things that

08:24.716 --> 08:28.761
happened. He was

08:28.781 --> 8:47.392
an unusual fellow, I know that. Have you read some of his stories? Yes, I have. What type of person was he? Well, he was kind 
of a loner.

08:47.392 --> 09:03.391
I'll just recount on it. I don't think he ever went for a girl at all. But he wrote some pretty outstanding stories.

09:03.391 --> 09:22.535
Well, as I was saying, I recall some of the stories he wrote when he was in high school. And they were really outstanding, 
but he never did. Uh, he really wasn't in our group. He was kind of a outsider. Yes, he was rarely accepted, but I remember

09:22.535 --> 09:45.580
one time, uh, we were having a party and, uh, I was running a little rental store there in Cross Plains and we were having a 
party upstairs and Robert came and we were, we were drinking some beer, choc beer or something. That was way back before

09:46.302 --> 10:13.428
prohibition. And I know he got very upset about it. He got a little bit tired and he said that he'd kill anybody that 
interfered with his hands. If his hands ever got damaged by somebody else, then he'd kill them.

10:13.428 --> 10:22.005
Hello? Yes, sir. And that was just kind of what he was, kind of morose.

10:22.005 --> 10:30.472
And he thought he had a real bright future in the head of him as a writer.

10:30.472 --> 10:48.217
And I don't think I ever saw him after that, until I heard he had committed suicide, didn't he? Yes, he did. In 1936. I knew 
his father real well. I didn't know his mother much. I know he was an only child, I believe.

10:48.217 --> 11:07.575
And he never did enter into any of our activities very much as I remember. So I don't really know if I could just tell you 
that it would help you. Well, what you've already told us is quite a bit of help. Why do you suppose he was such a loner?

11:07.575 --> 11:19.669
Being from such a small town and usually everybody, you know, does things so much together? I don't know. I don't 
know. He could have been a great author, I think. He had a... I don't remember even what kind of grades he made

11:19.669 --> 11:26.054
academically. I know I

11:27.636 --> 11:45.473
took an idea, he had a story, and tried to write a theme on it, and he'd already turned it down. And I got in big trouble there, 
as you know, trying to steal his ideas. And that kind of, I never did try that anymore again, but I know he could tell a story

11:45.473 --> 12:13.321
that was really, this was something about a bear who got up in the attic or something and broke through and disturbed some 
poker players. But then I really can't tell you very much about Robert. I'm thinking of it. There's another writer, C.S.

12:13.321 --> 12:19.560
Boyle, I don't know if you ever heard of him or not. Uh, no, sir. No, I don't believe

12:19.560 --> 12:39.608
so, no. What did Jack tell you about him? Mostly, uh, he had worked a little bit for Jack on the newspaper and, uh, well, Jack talked about, uh, what type of 
person he was, uh, vigorous man, although he kept to himself quite a bit. I wish I could recall more about that party, but I know he scared the hell out of all of us, because he got

12:39.608 --> 13:11.529
really excited and thought we was trying to damage his writing career or something, getting him full of beer. I don't 
recall exactly what, but anyway, he said he'd kill anybody that damaged his hands anyway. I seem like I remember that

13:11.529 --> 13:32.689
pretty vividly. I don't know, maybe something happened there with his hands. Maybe we got him wrestling match or 
something. I don't know. But anyway, he wanted to write with his hands.

13:32.689 --> 13:42.301
That's very interesting. You don't happen to recollect like any other things that you might have done with Howard back when we 
were living across. Well, like I say, he wasn't in our group. We went fishing, we went swimming in the bow there, and we

13:42.301 --> 14:09.345
hunted quail, but he was never one of us. And now he happened to be in this deal. I don't know, I don't think he ever had a 
date with a girl. He was a nice looking guy. very presentable and tall and well-made.

14:09.345 --> 14:22.018
And even if I talk to you, I can't really tell you anything much that I remember about him except that I remember him being a 
very outstanding, that he would have been a great writer, I think. Listen, what you've told me so far has been quite

14:23.259 --> 14:26.262
helpful. We're putting together just bits and pieces of people who did know him, along with some research that some 
other people have done. And

14:34.004 --> 14:52.246
I'd like to go ahead and put your recollections of that party and some of the other things you said into our program. Well, 
that's authentic, but I can't quite recall the details of what happened to his hands. Maybe we were armwrestling or

14:52.246 --> 15:13.826
something. I don't know. But he got very uptight about what might happen to one of his hands or his arms or something. I 
guess that was the only time he ever had a drink of beer in his life. It sounded like what I was talking to some of the other

15:13.826 --> 15:35.969
people that he might have been kind of insecure. Well, I think so. He was an only child. I know that. I don't know how close 
he was with his mother, but I don't think his father had anything to do with him. It was my kind of feeling, I don't know.

15:35.969 --> 15:50.129
Dr. Howard was a real fine man, though I don't know how close they were together, but I think that he worshipped his mother 
was my impression in those years.

15:52.974 --> 16:14.747
I don't know whether she died first or not, do you? She had gone into a coma and was not expected to recover. Oh, well now 
that's the reason for the suicide. because he worshipped her. I know I can almost be sure of that, but he worshipped his mother.

16:18.773 --> 16:22.738
And I know that her condition affected him very much.

16:25.561 --> 16:41.750
And I know that he was real afraid that something would happen that he couldn't write in. whether it was mine or whether it 
was in his mind or whether it was in his fear that something would happen to his hands. But that sense is that I recall more

16:41.750 --> 17:03.010
vividly than anything else and I've often thought of it. I certainly do appreciate your talking with me. And I believe I 
was the one that, I believe that he could have strangled me to death there. I don't recall whether it was me or somebody else, but it seemed to me like his anger was toward me. But I know he frightened the hell out of us.

17:03.010 --> 17:28.795
He was a very big and strong fellow. Yes, very strong. Could have twisted your neck off. Much like the heroes that he wrote 
about.

17:28.795 --> 17:41.468
If you give me your address, I'll send you a release form. What that does is simply you give us permission to use what I've 
been taping. Oh, well, that doesn't matter to me. I don't care if I use it or not. I'm just trying to be honest with you. And I

17:41.468 --> 18:00.601
have no hold on it. You can quote me any way you want to do it. And as I say, it's been a long time ago, but those are my 
recollections and I've often thought he made a real strong impression on me, that I was in real danger there. Well,

18:00.601 --> 18:27.507
fortunately you made it through it. Other things have happened to me that I guess is almost as dangerous, but then anyway, 
that's what I remember about Robert. Truth, all that was no problem, apparently, and no attachments that I know of to anybody except
