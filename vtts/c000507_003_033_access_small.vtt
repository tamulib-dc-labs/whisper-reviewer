00:09.080 --> 00:13.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.140 --> 00:38.640
And here are your hosts.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.140
This is David Carson and David Cruz.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.800
Few characters in either science fiction or fantasy have been as fascinating to readers

00:49.800 --> 00:51.040
as Conan the Barbarian.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.300
Conan is the creation of Robert E. Howard, a writer of the 1930s who lived in cross-plains,

00:56.440 --> 00:56.660
Texas.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.900
Howard filled the pulp magazines of his day with westerns, detective stories, horror stories,

01:01.900 --> 01:04.660
science fantasy, just about anything that would sell.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.140
But he became best known for his tales of heroic fantasy, particularly the ones that

01:09.140 --> 01:09.840
involved Conan.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.260
Conan was a giant barbarian who lived a swashbuckling life in the mythical, hiberian age that Howard

01:15.260 --> 01:15.740
created.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.680
There is nothing fancy or subtle about Conan.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.920
He survives and flourishes by pure muscle and swordplay.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.220
Howard's writing was colorful and exciting, and perfectly matched his hero.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.220
Howard committed suicide in 1936 at the age of 30.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.520
He left a number of unfinished Conan manuscripts and story ideas.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.100
And the character of Conan was so appealing to readers that authors have recently been

01:43.100 --> 01:46.880
writing new material on him or finishing Howard's own incomplete stories.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.740
Noted science fiction and fantasy author L. Spray DeKamp has written Conan's stories

01:51.740 --> 01:55.000
and become interested enough in Howard's life to write a biography of him.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.180
We asked DeKamp if Howard was anything like Conan.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.880
Well, everybody knows that Conan is an idealization of Howard.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.400
In other words, the kind of person that Howard thought he would have liked to have been,

02:07.940 --> 02:12.880
the ruthless, domineering, footloose, irresponsible adventurer.

02:14.540 --> 02:21.000
Actually, Robert, and with no respect for laws and regulations.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.220
But the key word here is idealization.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.640
DeKamp says Howard and Conan were nothing alike.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.080
Actually Robert was just the opposite type.

02:30.880 --> 02:38.320
Except for hot tempers and chivalrous attitude toward women, they had nothing in common.

02:38.880 --> 02:56.340
Robert Howard was shy, bookish, compassionate, extremely polite, and socially timid.

02:57.300 --> 03:03.780
And he's so law abiding that he wouldn't cut across the neighbor's lot even,

03:03.860 --> 03:05.840
although everybody else across the lane did.

03:07.220 --> 03:13.620
He was just about as different from the character Conan in the stories as a person could be.

03:14.440 --> 03:19.420
DeKamp believes Howard yearned to live in a past age, some more heroic time than the present.

03:20.680 --> 03:27.480
Well, Robert was always talking a lot about how he wished that he thought he'd been really in his element

03:27.480 --> 03:32.120
if he'd been born on the Texan frontier in the 19th century,

03:32.120 --> 03:38.040
or in some barbarian society like the ancient Gauls or Goths or somebody.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.480
Well, I think he'd have had a very unpleasant surprise, because it wasn't his temperament at all.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.900
He was a shy bookish introvert.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.500
Finally, DeKamp reveals that Howard had a serious mental problem.

03:57.520 --> 04:03.920
He had an outsized monkey on his back, and he was doomed from some way back.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.460
He planned his suicide ever since he was a little boy.

04:08.020 --> 04:12.880
He told his mother when he was a little kitty that when mama, when you die, I want to die with you.

04:13.560 --> 04:18.260
And the foolish woman, I think, probably sort of giggled and encouraged him.

04:18.740 --> 04:24.140
It was long planned, and several people knew about it, but they didn't do anything.

04:24.140 --> 04:29.040
The only thing you could have done with Robert was if you'd gotten him to a good shrink early enough,

04:30.200 --> 04:35.340
quite a good many years before he actually killed himself, why, something might have been done,

04:35.620 --> 04:37.720
but that, of course, is uncertain.

04:38.760 --> 04:44.220
Howard wrote some 21 Conan stories, most of which appeared in Weird Tales in the 1930s.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.440
Only one novel, Conan the Conqueror, was published, and that was some time after Howard's death.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.700
More next time about Robert E. Howard.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:01.920 --> 05:04.560
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:04.820 --> 05:07.740
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.740 --> 06:18.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.380
And here are your hosts.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.340
This is David Cruz.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.280
And David Carson.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.680
There are subcategories coming under the general headings of science fiction and fantasy.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.960
One of the most popular these days is heroic fantasy.

06:37.460 --> 06:42.140
It's sometimes called sword and sorcery, a term that almost serves as a definition for the genre.

06:42.140 --> 06:47.960
It deals with heroic barbarians swinging large bloody swords and sorcerers conjuring up all manner of demons.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.460
And as we've said, it's popular nowadays, particularly the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard.

06:54.020 --> 06:59.760
We asked an authority on heroic fantasy, L. Spray De Camp, to tell us why the form is so fascinating to readers.

07:00.360 --> 07:11.460
I think that part of the popularity of the genre was a reaction to certain trends in fiction

07:11.460 --> 07:24.960
following the Second World War, such as the fondness for heavily subjective psychological or psychiatric stories.

07:26.440 --> 07:34.600
Very sentimental stories, stories glorifying the little man, the anti-hero, you know,

07:34.600 --> 07:41.660
that hopeless little jerk who can't do anything right and who has no brains or brawn or character

07:41.660 --> 07:43.860
and whose only function is to suffer and suffer.

07:44.580 --> 07:48.140
Well, I think people got sort of tired of that after a while.

07:48.460 --> 07:54.960
So they, then, between the paperback publication of the Conan stories,

07:55.200 --> 07:58.240
for which I can claim the credit, I'm the one who sold them,

07:58.240 --> 08:03.140
and the paperback publication of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings,

08:03.460 --> 08:08.280
which was the other major factor in launching this boom,

08:08.840 --> 08:17.040
why that got people to reading heroic fantasy on a large scale, which they are still doing.

08:28.300 --> 08:33.460
De Camp has written his own sword and sorcery, but he's also worked on the Conan material of Robert E. Howard.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.480
He tells us how he was introduced to Howard's stories of Conan.

08:37.720 --> 08:49.420
I went up to New York in, it was around the end of 1950, and let me see, I think it was a naval war game at Pratt's apartment

08:49.420 --> 08:52.420
or something, no it wasn't, it was a party at Pratt's apartment.

08:53.420 --> 09:00.600
And he handed me a copy of Conan the Conqueror, Bound in Hardback, published by Noam Press.

09:01.680 --> 09:08.340
And he said, here, take this so long, I think you might find it interesting, I don't care much for it myself, but who knows.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.580
So I took it, it seems that Martin had, by inadvertence, sent Fletcher to review copies, and Fletcher gave me one.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.780
I started reading it on the train going home and was hooked right away.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.420
Kept on until I read the thing through and then I read it through again.

09:27.580 --> 09:32.180
Howard died in the 1930s, but De Camp became so involved with the character of Conan

09:32.180 --> 09:36.120
that he started to edit some of Howard's papers and to write his own Conan stories.

09:37.110 --> 09:50.740
And then a year later, I learned about some unpublished Conan manuscripts in the custody of the agent for the Howard Literary Estate.

09:51.620 --> 10:02.800
And I read them and arrangements were made with the Howard Ayers and the agent for me to edit them and arrange for publication.

10:02.800 --> 10:09.740
And then on, things have gone on and on and built up from that.

10:13.140 --> 10:23.200
De Camp has written original Conan material, but he's also finished incomplete Howard's stories and edited others.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.920
De Camp is also technical advisor to a movie on Conan that will premiere this week.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.920
It's entitled Conan the Barbarian, and it will show you what heroic fantasy is all about.

10:33.220 --> 10:35.380
More about Robert E. Howard next time.

10:42.580 --> 10:47.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:47.920 --> 10:51.220
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

10:57.920 --> 11:27.900
The show is a series of episodes with the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the

11:57.820 --> 11:57.860
Card naughty!

11:57.860 --> 11:58.980
and fantasy.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.400
And here are your hosts.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.540
This is David Carson.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.480
And David Cruz.

12:10.780 --> 12:13.620
Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the Barbarian, was a paradox.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.840
He was brought up on the arid plains of west central Texas,

12:17.300 --> 12:19.380
lived in the small country town of cross plains,

12:19.560 --> 12:20.800
and hardly did any traveling.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.580
And he died by his own hand at the age of 30.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.940
Yet Howard wrote heroic stories that were set in the mythical age

12:26.940 --> 12:28.120
after the fall of Atlantis.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.220
He was fascinated with the misty, cold northern landscape

12:31.220 --> 12:32.440
in which he set his tales.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.060
Conan, his greatest creation, was a barbarian from the north,

12:36.480 --> 12:40.180
a giant who strode across the Hyborian age, wielding a bloody broadsword.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.000
But Howard's life was a quiet one.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.580
He was introverted, bookish, and shy.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.800
As far as we know, he was never in a brawl or fight of any kind.

12:48.360 --> 12:52.020
Why did Howard create Conan and place him in a mythical northern landscape?

12:52.540 --> 12:55.160
What sort of mind would conceive of a barbarian hero,

12:55.160 --> 12:57.240
a loner who spurns civilization?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.480
We spoke with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin,

12:59.720 --> 13:02.120
a professor at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas,

13:02.560 --> 13:04.580
not far from Howard's home in cross plains.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.900
Dr. Laughlin is intimate with Howard's life

13:06.900 --> 13:09.000
and has done research for a Howard biography.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.540
She believes there are some reasons for Howard's obsession with Conan.

13:13.620 --> 13:18.720
I think that again, it was a sort of explanation for why he did not fit in with other people.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.640
He liked to believe I am the last barbarian.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.660
It's because in my type, Will Preveille,

13:25.320 --> 13:29.000
he liked to believe that the other people had a veneer of civilization on them

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
that got them away from the basics that were really important.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.200
And if you've read his correspondence with Lovecraft,

13:35.580 --> 13:42.480
they had long arguments about the physical versus the intellectual needs of a society.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.420
And Howard would say that in the tough country where he lived,

13:46.520 --> 13:49.160
you had to be physically fit, and he spent a great deal of his life,

13:49.160 --> 13:51.860
his adult life trying to be physically fit,

13:52.620 --> 13:56.140
boxing and working out and that sort of thing.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.640
Howard also was fascinated with the legendary past of Britain,

14:06.060 --> 14:09.360
especially with the savage Picks and the early heroes of Celtic myth.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.440
Some of his Conan stories, such as Across the Dark River,

14:12.820 --> 14:14.320
have ancient Britain as their setting.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.260
We asked Dr. Loughlin why Howard was so drawn to this material.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.100
He claimed that he was full blood Irish and they were the Irish kings,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.100
like some other people we know claim to be.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
But there's no evidence that he certainly was not full blood Irish.

14:28.720 --> 14:33.600
People have traced his genealogy, but this was part of his image of himself.

14:33.780 --> 14:37.140
He was trying to project other people and trying to create for himself.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.200
There again he wrote at one time that he wrote about the barren, cold,

14:43.320 --> 14:47.660
windswept, damp areas, even though he lived here.

14:47.940 --> 14:50.140
I think that again might be a sort of wish fulfillment

14:50.140 --> 14:53.720
who wouldn't like to be someplace where it's cold on a day like this.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.080
He wanted to be away from where he was because I don't think we can underestimate

14:58.080 --> 15:03.540
the anger and frustration that was boiling around in Robert Howard all the time.

15:03.540 --> 15:10.540
I see it in all of his poetry and a great deal of his fiction.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.920
Cross Plains neighbors say that he had a...

15:13.920 --> 15:18.500
There was a big tree stump out by his yard and I believe it was a sledgehammer, not an axe.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.380
And sometimes in the middle of the day he would go out there,

15:21.500 --> 15:23.000
you know, and you could just see that he was so tense

15:23.460 --> 15:28.080
and he would take that sledgehammer and he would just wham it and wham it and wham it on this tree stump.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.980
That a tremendous amount of anger he didn't fit in with other people,

15:32.980 --> 15:38.800
he wanted to be somewhere else, so he wrote about something that was like nothing he had experienced.

15:45.740 --> 15:50.540
Howard wrote Reams of Fantasy and the Pulp Era of the 1930s, most of it for weird tales.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.240
We asked Dr. Loughlin why Howard wrote Fantasy.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.880
Did he have the talent to write more realistic fiction that might have gotten him out of the Pulp Ghetto?

15:58.940 --> 16:03.560
He may have had the talent, but I certainly don't believe he was capable of writing realistic fiction.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.200
He was not that closely tied to reality himself.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.500
I don't believe he ever could have written realistic novels. He had to write fantasies of some sort.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.580
More about Robert E. Howard next time.

16:22.040 --> 16:28.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:28.260 --> 16:31.180
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:45.580 --> 17:15.560
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:15.560 --> 17:18.640
Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:34.400 --> 17:39.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.040
And here are your hosts.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.820
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

17:51.320 --> 17:57.660
Fantasy writer Robert E. Howard grew up in the 1920s and the 1930s in the small Texas town of Cross Plains.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.520
But he wasn't like other small town boys. He kept to himself quite a bit.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.780
He read a lot and used a vivid imagination to create his memorable heroic fantasies,

18:06.380 --> 18:09.080
for most of which are the stories of Conan the Barbarian.

18:09.560 --> 18:14.260
Howard died in 1936, but some of the people in Cross Plains still remember him clearly.

18:14.820 --> 18:18.920
We spoke with two of Howard's friends, Jack Scott, the editor of the Cross Plains newspaper,

18:19.500 --> 18:21.520
and Leroy Butler, Howard's next door neighbor.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.700
Butler remembers a time when he and Howard were still children,

18:24.980 --> 18:27.720
and they bought some swords from a mail order company in New York.

18:28.680 --> 18:33.260
But we ordered those things and we'd get out in the backyard and wrap a bandana

18:33.260 --> 18:39.900
around our hedge-like pirate, and we'd get out and fence with those things.

18:40.660 --> 18:46.280
Of course we didn't dare, you know, hit each other with them because they were, they'd have gone through you.

18:48.100 --> 18:52.820
But we did that quite a bit. We had an immense live oak tree in our backyard,

18:52.820 --> 18:56.040
and we'd get out there and shade that old tree in,

18:58.720 --> 19:04.320
pretend that we were back maybe in the dark ages or something,

19:05.840 --> 19:11.960
or in the time of the Spanish man, things like that.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.860
He had things like that on his mind all the time.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.280
Butler says that Robert was a loner dedicated to his writing.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.380
Robert never married, he never seemed interested in girls,

19:27.520 --> 19:31.340
and he did have one girlfriend there in Cross Plains for a time.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.180
I'd see him out in the car driving around once in a while,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.160
but I don't think that lasted long.

19:37.940 --> 19:42.800
He was just wrapped up in his, in his work writing those stories,

19:44.840 --> 19:51.080
and he had a blast-in-back porch on the southeast side of the house there,

19:52.680 --> 19:55.720
and it wasn't too far from my mother's bedroom,

19:57.520 --> 20:01.440
and a lot of times at night he'd wake her up with that typewriter clock,

20:01.640 --> 20:03.480
and you know, at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.980
Some inspiration, he'd probably be laying there in bed and think of something,

20:09.080 --> 20:11.260
and he'd get up and write it down right quick.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.000
And he just worked all hours.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.620
Jack Scott also comments on Howard's unusual personality.

20:21.460 --> 20:25.800
Howard was a little on the, a little, little on the odd side.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.700
He wasn't in them, but there was very many people,

20:27.820 --> 20:31.140
and he was rather in a loop, but he was a big robust man.

20:31.820 --> 20:36.800
To me, he was a combination of, uh, Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London,

20:37.040 --> 20:38.980
if you can imagine that two together.

20:40.140 --> 20:43.760
In 1936, when Howard's mother was dying of a terminal illness,

20:44.180 --> 20:45.360
Howard took his own life.

20:46.340 --> 20:50.600
I remember, I remember the morning he, he killed himself very well.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.380
I heard on the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself,

20:54.700 --> 20:58.300
and I immediately jumped in my car and ran down there,

20:58.560 --> 21:01.940
and got down there, and a few neighbors had gathered.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.380
Uh, it wasn't generally known over town, but, uh,

21:05.380 --> 21:12.140
the old justice of the peace was standing there on the, on the, uh, gallery, the front porch,

21:12.680 --> 21:14.400
and when I walked up, he called and said,

21:14.440 --> 21:18.040
come here, Jack, and I stepped up there, and he took me into the bedroom,

21:18.800 --> 21:22.420
and he, he pointed to an old Underwood typewriter,

21:22.640 --> 21:24.860
and he's had four lines written on it there,

21:25.620 --> 21:30.640
and Howard had, had, uh, when he had been told that his mother wouldn't,

21:30.640 --> 21:33.620
uh, wouldn't live throughout the day,

21:33.620 --> 21:37.060
uh, he went to this typewriter, wrote these four lines,

21:37.060 --> 21:40.140
walked outside, and sat down his car and shot his head off,

21:40.880 --> 21:44.800
and this old J.P. asked me what these four lines meant, meant.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.460
They said, I'm sure you've read them all, fled all done,

21:48.460 --> 21:52.460
so let me on the tire, the feast is over, the lamps expire.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.940
More about Robert E. Howard next time.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:05.660 --> 22:08.260
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:08.260 --> 22:11.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:55.940 --> 22:56.700
So stay with us.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.920
This is David Carson.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.000
And David Cruz.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.940
Will Conan the Barbarian ever die, or will he go on forever?

23:32.560 --> 23:35.240
A large portion of the fantasy section of bookstores these days

23:35.240 --> 23:36.740
is filled with books about Conan,

23:37.160 --> 23:39.780
the heroic barbarian created by the late Robert E. Howard.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.960
Howard devised a mythical error for his hero and called it the Hyborian Age.

23:44.420 --> 23:46.600
The period falls somewhere between the fall of Atlantis

23:46.600 --> 23:48.260
and the beginnings of recorded history.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.120
Conan is a giant barbarian from Samaria,

23:51.620 --> 23:54.500
a region to the north of the more civilized Hyborian kingdoms.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.920
With his huge sword, he is an irresistible force that no man can stand up to.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.560
Howard wrote some 21 Conan stories in the 1930s,

24:02.860 --> 24:05.000
most published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.280
They traced the life of the barbarian from his teenage years

24:08.280 --> 24:10.300
to his later maturity when he became a king.

24:10.940 --> 24:12.960
The tales are full of lusty, bloody adventure,

24:13.220 --> 24:16.020
pure escape fantasy that appeals to man's primal instincts.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.900
Conan battles warriors, sorcerers, and monsters of all shapes.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.700
He's a thief, a soldier, a swashbuckling parrot, and a king.

24:23.700 --> 24:28.120
The Conan stories are so popular that a number of publishing houses have been putting them out.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.960
And a number of different authors have been writing Conan stories.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.380
Howard left many gaps in the life of Conan,

24:33.560 --> 24:37.200
and various contemporary writers have been filling those gaps with original stories.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.860
Elspray De Camp was the first author to do that.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.860
These stories done by other writers are called pastiches,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.140
and established writers such as De Camp, Andrew J. Offit,

24:46.500 --> 24:49.800
Poole Anderson, Lynn Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg have done them.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.140
We went to Robert E. Howard's home territory.

24:52.140 --> 24:55.400
The Brownwood Cross Plains area of West Central Texas

24:55.400 --> 24:58.360
to speak with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin and Dr. William Crider.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.460
Dr. Laughlin has done research for a biography of Howard,

25:01.800 --> 25:05.260
and Dr. Crider teaches science fiction and fantasy at Howard Payne University.

25:05.940 --> 25:08.360
Dr. Crider explains what a pastiche is.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.400
Well, in the sense that we've been talking about it,

25:11.400 --> 25:15.220
it's where one writer takes a character and a world

25:16.080 --> 25:19.120
like the Hiborian Age created by another writer

25:19.120 --> 25:24.160
and writes new stories with the same character and the same setting.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.800
And he gets the full credit for the story,

25:27.880 --> 25:32.920
but the other writer has created the character and the historical setting.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.320
Also, De Camp did something similar where he took incomplete Howard stories

25:40.320 --> 25:45.440
and changed them into Conan stories,

25:45.440 --> 25:49.240
which would be a pastiche of a slightly different kind,

25:49.480 --> 25:52.780
but it's the same principle operating.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.800
The biography of Howard, entitled Dark Valley Destiny,

26:05.320 --> 26:07.840
has been written by L. Sprague De Camp and his wife, Catherine,

26:08.020 --> 26:10.340
and will probably be out sometime in the next year.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.320
The book will mainly be a psychological study of Howard,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.480
which attempts to explain why he wrote the kind of material he did.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.300
Conan has been so popular that a major movie about him, entitled Conan the Barbarian,

26:21.740 --> 26:23.420
is premiering this week across the country.

26:23.980 --> 26:27.700
It was filmed in Spain by director John Milius and produced by Dino de Laurentiis,

26:28.020 --> 26:30.420
and has muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Conan.

26:30.940 --> 26:35.360
Early reports indicate that it does a marvelous job of conveying the atmosphere of sword and sorcery,

26:35.440 --> 26:36.800
essential to a Conan adventure.

26:37.300 --> 26:40.340
Laughlin and Crider talk about the movie and about Conan's popularity.

26:41.140 --> 26:46.700
If this is a huge success, like Star Wars, let's say,

26:47.080 --> 26:50.380
that could give even more impetus to this kind of thing,

26:50.440 --> 26:57.280
and we may see Howard going on forever with these pastiches being done by...

26:57.280 --> 27:00.140
I think it's possible that they would be continued,

27:00.360 --> 27:03.940
because the original idea was to fill out Conan's life,

27:04.560 --> 27:07.580
you know, have his life completely covered by the pastiches from,

27:07.580 --> 27:11.820
I don't know if it went to his boyhood, but certainly all of his adult life

27:11.820 --> 27:15.640
when he was an old King Conan, and it's already gone beyond that.

27:15.840 --> 27:19.740
They filled out his life, and then they're going back to, you know, this stage in his life.

27:19.860 --> 27:20.680
He did such and such.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.440
So certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the chronological life of Conan,

27:25.700 --> 27:27.980
so the potential to go on beyond is there.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.580
The potential to keep Conan alive and adventuring is definitely there.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.920
We should be hearing a lot more from Conan.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

27:44.880 --> 27:47.500
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

27:47.500 --> 27:50.680
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:07.580 --> 28:18.420
