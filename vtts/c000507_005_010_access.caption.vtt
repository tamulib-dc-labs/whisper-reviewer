The Science Fiction Radio Show A commentary on science fiction today Presented
by the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

00:23.520 --> 00:26.960
This is David Crews Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:31.580 --> 00:41.900
The subject of this show is space exploration. We're putting two limitations on
that subject. One, that the exploration be outside the solar system. And two,

00:41.980 --> 00:50.960
that the story or novel we discuss involve the process of searching or exploring
primarily, not simply the result of the exploration. And especially with those

00:50.960 --> 00:58.520
limitations, I think we have perhaps the purest of all science fiction themes or
plots. Man's history on this planet has been a process of searching,

00:58.720 --> 01:07.440
discovering, then taming or civilizing. The discovery of the New World, for
instance, was the result of a deliberate act of search by various European

01:07.440 --> 01:19.040
explorers, culminating with Columbus. The American West, as discovered and
mapped by Lewis and Clark, is a classic example of exploration. Now, space, or

01:19.040 --> 01:28.980
our galaxy, the universe, is simply the next area to explore and discover and
tame. I think the importance and purity of the theme lies in the notion that

01:28.980 --> 01:38.160
searching and discovering is the very essence of human nature. It's at the
center of our survival instinct. Without it, we wouldn't be human. We've

01:38.160 --> 01:45.840
conquered the frontiers of Earth, and now we're ready to confront, we must
confront, what one influential science fiction production has called the final

01:45.840 --> 01:46.260
frontier.

02:38.160 --> 02:47.800
Star Trek first came on the air in 1966 and continued through 1969 with 78
episodes being completed for the series. The show had several major science

02:47.800 --> 02:56.780
fiction authors writing for it, including Harlan Ellison, Theodore Sturgeon, and
David Gerrold. It would be hard to think of a better example of the space

02:56.780 --> 03:07.680
exploration theme. I think Star Trek epitomizes that, because episode after
episode, you saw the crew members of the Enterprise confront aliens, all sorts

03:07.680 --> 03:18.820
of problems in a hostile universe. But they kept going, their spirit, their
courage, their desire to go beyond mankind's limits almost, carried the show for

03:18.820 --> 03:27.600
a long time. And I think it sort of is the essence of the space exploration
theme, for pure exploration's sake. It was a fairly popular show when it was on

03:27.600 --> 03:35.620
the air, but it gained in popularity considerably after it went off the air and
went into syndication. And conventions are held, Star Trek conventions, and it

03:35.620 --> 03:46.020
eventually spawned a movie. Well, fitting in with your parameters on space
exploration, we never saw the Enterprise going on a particular mission to do

03:46.020 --> 03:54.840
something in particular. It was always just out there exploring with no
particular thing in mind. And whatever happened to it seemed to happen by

03:54.840 --> 04:04.660
accident, or it just happened. They were out there, and an alien ship advanced
upon them, or they found some planet with a distress signal calling out. But

04:04.660 --> 04:12.880
they were never really going to any particular place, as far as we were told. I
believe that really is kind of covered in the preamble to the show, where

04:12.880 --> 04:22.860
William Shatner says they're on that five-year mission to explore new planets
and to discover what's out there. I think that has to be one of the reasons the

04:22.860 --> 04:34.640
show is so popular, again, because simply it satisfies people's need for the
unknown, for the search, for the exploration, to seek something which is

04:34.640 --> 04:46.280
mysterious, which is unknown. It simply caught the imagination, I think, of more
than pure science fiction fans. I think everybody was fascinated with that kind

04:46.280 --> 04:57.940
of theme. I think this is especially shown in the episode called The Side of
Paradise. Yes, I think they did that theme a number of times, or not a number,

04:58.060 --> 05:09.460
but every so often. I think that particular episode is the best expression of
it. But they advanced to this particular planet and beamed down, as they did on

05:09.460 --> 05:19.780
their transporters. There was a particular plant on this planet that shot spores
whenever one of the crew members got near it. And these spores would seemingly,

05:19.780 --> 05:33.860
well, cause a state of total happiness, total contentment in the individual. He
didn't have a sense of a goal. He didn't want to strive. He simply wanted to

05:33.860 --> 05:43.140
stagnate. I'm reminded of the poem by Tennyson, "The Lotus-Eaters", where the
crew of Ulysses ate the lotus plant and wanted to stay on the island forever

05:43.140 --> 05:55.100
without moving, without striving, without trying. Kirk, the captain, Captain
Kirk is one of the few who was not infected by the spores. And with the power of

05:55.100 --> 06:05.880
his personality, his cleverness, he is able to overturn the influence these
spores have had on his crew members. But I think the significance of it is that

06:05.880 --> 06:14.160
they are going to continue. They're not satisfied. They're not content. They
would have been perfectly happy to live the rest of their existence on this

06:14.160 --> 06:22.640
planet. It was sort of an Eden, a paradise. But that's not enough for people.
They need a goal. They need something to strive for. Or they're not human. And

06:22.640 --> 06:33.120
Kirk is able to get the crew members back to their original states, and the
Enterprise goes on. For an example of a novel that deals strictly in this type

06:33.120 --> 06:43.240
of space exploration, let's turn to a novel called The Voyage of the Space
Beagle. It was written by A.E. Van Vogt in 1950. It's actually a collection of

06:43.240 --> 06:53.880
four short stories that he tied together with a new character. The original
short stories were Black Destroyer and Discord in Scarlet, written in 1939, M33

06:53.880 --> 07:06.620
in Andromeda, written in 1943, and War of Nerves, written in 1950. These four
stories he took and tied together with the theme of going out and exploring

07:06.620 --> 07:18.180
space with these four episodes becoming four things that happened to the ship
and the people on it. In each of the stories, we meet a different kind of alien

07:18.180 --> 07:27.660
and have to deal with it in a life-and-death situation. The first of these
episodes takes place when the crew lands on an alien planet and is discovered by

07:27.660 --> 07:38.120
a creature named Coeurl. Coeurl is a cat-like creature, and he soon lures his way on
board the ship. The scientists are very eager to study him and see what his

07:38.120 --> 07:48.120
physiological makeup is like, how his psychology has adapted him to this type of
planet, and generally what he is. Elliot Grosvenor, the main character that ties

07:48.120 --> 08:00.140
the stories together, is somewhat suspect of Coeurl, and his suspicions are well
-founded. In an accident, they discover that Coeurl can control electrical

08:00.140 --> 08:10.900
energies through his body. And once Coeurl discovers that the human beings have
learned this from him, he becomes immediately very fearful of them. He's a very,

08:11.000 --> 08:24.340
very powerful creature, and they lock him inside a cage, but he manages to
negate the electronic lock and get out and starts horribly killing the crewmen.

08:25.040 --> 08:36.560
And then running back to the cell and locking him back inside it, hoping to
create a panic on board the ship, the crew almost immediately discovers what is

08:36.560 --> 08:48.720
happening and becomes a war between the crew and the creature. And in the end,
Coeurl leaves the ship by means of a lifeboat. Because he doesn't understand the

08:48.720 --> 08:58.620
faster-than-light drive on the ship, he attempts to fly back toward his planet,
but he's traveling away from his planet faster than he is traveling toward it

08:58.620 --> 09:06.580
when he leaves the ship. And even though he's flying toward his planet, his
planet still recedes into the distance, and he goes insane trying to figure this

09:06.580 --> 09:18.540
out. The second episode in the book, which is one of the original short stories,
is about a race of aliens that are very bird-like, called the Riim, or the Riim

09:18.540 --> 09:29.660
people. They have an entirely mental existence. They communicate by telepathy,
and they try to contact the space beagle with their mental emanations through

09:29.660 --> 09:40.080
telepathy. And they're friendly. All they want to do is contact the ship, but it
creates havoc on the space beagle. And this mental power that enters the

09:40.080 --> 09:49.040
spaceship drives some of the men mad. It causes psychological aberrations. It
brings out hostilities. It exaggerates certain mental conditions in the crew.

09:50.960 --> 10:03.640
And Grosvener, the same one who was suspicious of Coeurl in the previous episode,
is able, with his specialized equipment, to mentally contact the Riim to let them

10:03.640 --> 10:12.340
know what's happening and ask them to call off their attack, which is done, and
the Space Beagle is allowed to continue. The third section of the book deals

10:12.340 --> 10:24.300
with a somewhat different type of alien. The Space Beagle is voyaging between
galaxies in intergalactic space where there is absolutely nothing. When all of a

10:24.300 --> 10:36.600
sudden they come across the path of an alien who seems to be floating in this
intergalactic void. The alien had no hope of ever reaching one of the galaxies.

10:36.880 --> 10:47.880
He was stranded out there when the ship just happened to pass by. And the alien
immediately taps some of the energy from the drive of the ship and stops the

10:47.880 --> 10:59.600
ship dead in its tracks. The humans crawl out of the ship and fix the exterior,
and then they notice the alien floating right by the ship. The alien comes

10:59.600 --> 11:11.960
aboard the ship after they try to capture him in a cage and immediately
recognizes the situation as being very advantageous to him. This creature is

11:11.960 --> 11:23.300
extremely powerful, and he's from an ancient civilization that existed in the
previous cycle of the universe. When that universe exploded, this creature was

11:23.300 --> 11:36.560
shot out into the place where they found him without any hope of gaining access
to a galaxy. When he meets the men, he is able to use them as host creatures or

11:36.560 --> 11:51.220
bodies for his eggs in order to raise up more of these creatures. The Ixtl, as
the alien is called in the book, takes over part of the ship, and it's really a

11:51.220 --> 12:01.420
race between him and the rest of the humans as to who's going to control. If the
humans allow him to gain the upper hand, he will eventually control all of the

12:01.420 --> 12:14.500
galaxy that they're going to. The only way that the humans could rid themselves
of Ixtl was by using their mental agility and leaving the ship long enough that

12:14.500 --> 12:24.040
they could impose a force field of energy that would kill the creature. The
creature found out what they were doing just in time to escape, and he got back

12:24.040 --> 12:35.080
into his original fix floating out in the middle of intergalactic space with no
hope of ever gaining access to the galaxy as the humans went on to their next

12:35.080 --> 12:48.120
episode. The last one involves a creature very difficult to describe. It's sort
of a cloud, a huge cloud creature without any particular name, but it feeds on

12:48.120 --> 12:58.940
death. It started out as a very small, small organism. First of all, it fed on
the deaths of insects, then smaller animals and larger animals. It kept growing

12:58.940 --> 13:10.480
all the while. And it's gotten so huge that it needs the deaths of creatures on
an entire planet to exist. So it's gained the power and the size and the

13:10.480 --> 13:20.280
strength to terraform planets. And as the Space Beagle goes through a particular
system, they find that all of the planets they're passing are similar. They're

13:20.280 --> 13:33.580
covered with tropical vegetation, with large primitive kinds of animals engaged
in conflict, which leads to many deaths that this creature is feeding on. The

13:33.580 --> 13:40.440
scientists on the Space Beagle figure out what's happening and realize that
their own solar system is in great danger because this creature is expanding all

13:40.440 --> 13:49.380
the time. And they're afraid it's going to come to their own solar system. So
they devise a plan whereby they start destroying the planets that the creature

13:49.380 --> 14:03.700
is feeding on and lure him out into interstellar space where he's not able to
feed so that he will, we know, die away from the source of the death which

14:03.700 --> 14:12.440
nourishes him. So again, through their cleverness, through their ingenuity, the
humans have triumphed over an alien which, when you come right down to it, is

14:12.440 --> 14:21.460
much more powerful than they are. And I believe that typifies a lot of the
things in the novel in that the humans are always overcoming their adversaries

14:21.460 --> 14:33.120
by means of their cleverness. They seem to outwit aliens that are much more
powerful than they are physically and in some instances by specialized powers

14:33.120 --> 14:46.280
that they have. Coeurl could manipulate electromagnetic energies and Ixtl could
move through solid matter. But even with these abilities, the humans, by their

14:46.280 --> 14:55.580
own ingenuity, could outwit their adversaries. I think we should say something
for the aliens, though. In most of the pulp novels of the time that this one was

14:55.580 --> 15:05.740
written, we have so many of the bug-eyed monsters that are nothing more than
monsters. Here we have aliens that are truly intelligent and are fighting humans

15:05.740 --> 15:18.140
on a much greater level than just physical terror. They're well thought out.
They have purpose and a plan. We can say that these are really better aliens

15:18.140 --> 15:28.160
than what you would expect to find in most of the pulp novels of this type. I
think that change in the way the bug-eyed monsters were written about in science

15:28.160 --> 15:38.460
fiction came back in the 30s with Stanley Weinbaum, Martian Odyssey. Asimov has
described that as the first science fiction story in which the aliens are not

15:38.460 --> 15:47.840
simply humans in a strange form. They have their own reasons for existing. They
have their own ecology. They belong to a particular planet and they're a part of

15:47.840 --> 15:59.720
that planet. I think all of the aliens in this particular book are realistic in
terms of having an ecology built around them and having a psychology, a

15:59.720 --> 16:11.040
physiology which is not human. How shall we characterize this novel then? Is it
pulp fiction or is it something superior to that? Well, when Van Vogt started

16:11.040 --> 16:17.300
writing the stories, he was writing in the pulp tradition. It was still in the
late 30s when he started to write these stories which became the Space Beagle.

16:17.920 --> 16:26.500
But I think he goes beyond that. Even though he was trained in the pulp
tradition, I think he has more skill. He's more modern, perhaps under the

16:26.500 --> 16:35.520
influence of the editor John Campbell. And he's able to go beyond the pulp
formulas. These are realistic aliens. The humans in the book are characterized

16:35.520 --> 16:44.980
by realistic motives. They're not simply the plain hero types. They have their
quirks. They have their bad points the humans do. In fact, they all have to

16:44.980 --> 16:53.380
overcome the bad parts of human nature before they can defeat the aliens
themselves. So I think this is a step beyond the pulp tradition, even though the

16:53.380 --> 17:02.500
formulas and all the intentions of the story, I think, are the same as the early
pulp magazines. But Van Vogt is able to go beyond that.

17:15.620 --> 17:25.720
For our second consideration, we turn to a novel by Poul Anderson written in
1970. Tau Zero is a special kind of a science fiction book. There's not very

17:25.720 --> 17:34.620
many just like it. That's only one category that Anderson writes with, is the
kind of book that Tau Zero is. He writes almost anything. He writes pure

17:34.620 --> 17:43.380
fantasy. He'll write so-called soft or social science fiction. But there's
nobody better at writing hard science fiction than Poul Anderson. I think Tau

17:43.380 --> 17:51.460
Zero is perhaps his best example in that particular form because there's a great
deal of science in the book. And some readers might even think that it's a

17:51.460 --> 18:00.920
little obtrusive if they don't understand some of the concepts of relativity and
the Bussard ramjet, for instance. The science in the novel actually makes it

18:00.920 --> 18:16.300
extremely realistic. It's one of the more believable of the pure space epics
that's ever been written. The story is essentially that of a colony ship, a ship

18:16.300 --> 18:27.040
full of people, I think about 50 people, who are traveling to a colony at a
nearby star to set up and start life there. And on the way, after they've gone

18:27.040 --> 18:40.500
part of the way toward the star, the ship runs into a small nebula of gas, which
causes the ship to lose its power of deceleration. They cannot decelerate

18:40.500 --> 18:54.640
without causing so much radiation harm that they would all be killed. The only
way that they can hope to exist is to keep on accelerating until they can get to

18:54.640 --> 19:04.920
a place that is relatively free of gas, where they can go outside the ship,
outside of the protective barriers and shielding of the ship to repair that

19:04.920 --> 19:19.320
deceleration device. The story that develops is that the ship cannot find a
place that is free enough of gas that they can go out and repair the ship, and

19:19.320 --> 19:29.720
it keeps on accelerating until it's actually going through galaxies. But no
matter how fast they go, they can never go beyond the speed of light, because

19:29.720 --> 19:39.840
Anderson, as we've said before, is extremely true to the scientific knowledge of
our day, and according to the knowledge that we have, faster-than-light travel

19:39.840 --> 19:51.260
is impossible. So he has to dream up a method whereby this exploration trip can
go fast enough to get somewhere. And he's devised or he's used a ship called the

19:51.260 --> 20:04.040
Bussard Ramjet to do this. The Bussard Ramjet is not a new idea. It was invented
somewhere in the middle of the century. The basic format is that the ship picks

20:04.040 --> 20:17.120
up interstellar gas molecules by the use of a huge electromagnetic web of sorts,
a force field, if you will, that scoops up these interstellar particles and

20:17.120 --> 20:29.360
shoots them out the back end. This provides reaction mass, which drives the ship
forward. The point is that the faster the ship goes, the more gas molecules it

20:29.360 --> 20:41.980
supposedly will contact and shoot out the back end, thereby increasing its speed
more and more and more on a vicious cycle. The ship would be extremely

20:41.980 --> 20:55.080
radioactive or radiative to the point where there would be needed extreme
shielding for any human beings to be able to ride the thing. I believe in the

20:55.080 --> 21:04.540
works of Larry Niven, he had the same kind of a ship that was not habitable. He
had robots that used this ship, and everybody else had to come along on the slow

21:04.540 --> 21:16.160
boats. Here, however, Poul Anderson has had this ship big enough and sealed well
enough that humans can ride it. The trouble is, when they hit that gas cloud,

21:16.160 --> 21:25.540
that it not only destroyed their deceleration method, it also sped them up quite
a bit to the point where they were already past where they would have had to

21:25.540 --> 21:35.740
stop and turn around and slow down to get to their original destination. The
speed of the ship is one of the basic problems the crew must overcome. The great

21:35.740 --> 21:44.620
speed brings the theory of relativity into play. One of the basic concepts of
the theory of relativity is that the speed that time passes is relative to the

21:44.620 --> 21:54.460
speed that an object is moving. If you have two ships traveling through space
with ship A traveling faster than ship B, time will be moving slower on ship A

21:54.460 --> 22:05.160
than on ship B. In other words, the faster a ship moves, the slower time passes
on that ship relative to other slower-moving objects surrounding it. Everything

22:05.160 --> 22:13.960
appears normal on the ship to the crew, and time seems to be passing faster on
objects traveling slower than the ship. As hours and days pass on the ship,

22:14.180 --> 22:21.860
months and years pass on Earth, and the faster they travel, the greater this
time difference becomes. Eventually, the crew, while traveling between galaxies,

22:22.080 --> 22:34.980
watches the universe collapse into a huge mass. This ties in the current,
currently accepted theories of the origin of the universe by most of the

22:34.980 --> 22:50.480
scientific world. The Big Bang Theory, of course, in which the universe began as
one monomass of energy that explodes outward. There are two currently popular

22:50.480 --> 23:00.740
views of this. One is that the universe would then continue to expand until it
eventually burnt itself out, and that would be all a one-time-only affair. Or

23:00.740 --> 23:13.760
that the universe would again withdraw by gravitational force back into a
monomass and explode again, thus doing it numerable times, limitless times. This

23:13.760 --> 23:28.120
is the cyclic theory, and this is what Poul Anderson portrays in Tau Zero. The
people on board the ship go so fast that the universe dies around them. The time

23:28.120 --> 23:39.120
has passed exterior to the ship in great quantities. Of course, Earth and all of
its peoples, and assumably humankind, is long gone, and they are the only ones

23:39.120 --> 23:50.840
left, and they're waiting out the result of this withdrawal of the universe back
into a monomass to see what happens. Hopefully, for them, it will explode again.

23:51.080 --> 23:58.620
It's one of the things that Anderson tries to bring across is the incredible
amount of time that has passed while they've been on this incredibly fast flight

23:58.620 --> 24:07.780
across the universe. Millions and billions of years have passed as the universe
contracts back down into one large monomass before it explodes back out and

24:07.780 --> 24:16.980
creates new galaxies, new solar systems. And at the end of the novel, they
eventually land on one. They are able to slow down, and they land on one and

24:16.980 --> 24:27.080
begin to colonize. And presumably, then, they will carry on the human race
simply from the 50 members on this ship that have survived into a new universe.

24:27.580 --> 24:37.520
To me, that's one of the most fascinating of all journeys of exploration is to
see the death of a universe in the beginning of another one. That's fascinating,

24:37.540 --> 24:48.480
the way Anderson treats that material. It's ultimately very optimistic. I think
it's the essence of the exploration theme, you know, to strive, to seek, to

24:48.480 --> 24:58.100
never give up. And particularly with two characters on the book, I think we see
Anderson attempting to show two sides of human nature that allow it to persist

24:58.100 --> 25:11.280
and to survive. You have a woman, Ingrid Lindgren, who was second in command on
the ship. She epitomizes feeling, emotion, love, compassion. We have Charles

25:11.280 --> 25:19.280
Raymont, who is the, I guess you'd call him the policeman, the only military man
on board who is there to keep order. He is pure practicality, pure survival.

25:19.280 --> 25:29.300
He'll do anything to survive. He's very an emotional, very practical man.
Together, those two are able to keep the crew intact. They're able to give it

25:29.300 --> 25:40.180
hope. And they are the ones who are able to, well, allow the crew to survive
into this new universe where, you know, where humanity will keep going. The

25:40.180 --> 25:48.340
Voyage of the Space Beagle and Tau Zero, I think we would call two of the more
classic treatments of the space exploration theme. But there are many and

25:48.340 --> 25:58.720
ingenious methods, there's many varied ways that authors have come up with to
illustrate that particular theme. Always, I think, showing the desire of the

25:58.720 --> 26:14.860
human spirit to escape any kind of restraint. I want a ride to the ridge where
the west commences and gaze at the moon till I lose my senses and I can't look

26:14.860 --> 26:22.040
at hobbles and I can't stand fences. Don't fence me in.

26:26.840 --> 26:37.280
One early example, I think, and probably still one of the more popular ones is
the idea that Heinlein illustrated in Orphans of the Sky, published from two

26:37.280 --> 26:48.900
earlier short stories in 1941. He uses the device of a generation ship, which is
an artificial world, complete and self-sufficient, constructed and inhabited by

26:48.900 --> 26:58.300
human beings, which is sent slowly toward the stars. The original members won't
live to arrive, of course, but their descendants will, many generations removed.

26:58.600 --> 27:07.960
And that is one method of space exploration, although one which is a little
discouraging, I guess, to the original crew. In the film Dark Star, the

27:07.960 --> 27:16.860
protagonists are traveling throughout our galaxy, discovering new solar systems
which have habitable planets on them and destroying all the unstable planets in

27:16.860 --> 27:27.040
that system in order to make the system safe for colonization. And one other
rather unusual story we might mention is by Larry Niven. It's called Rammer. It

27:27.040 --> 27:36.840
was a short story and then made into a novel, A World Out of Time. Here a
corpsicle, a person who has had himself frozen in order that he might be revived

27:36.840 --> 27:46.600
later for medical treatment, I think the fellow had cancer or some such disease,
awakes into a future society where they want him for only one purpose or they

27:46.600 --> 27:55.200
don't want him at all, and that's to pilot a starship. The fellow is amazed, but
he goes along with it because it's his only hope for life, takes the starship

27:55.200 --> 28:06.380
and escapes away from the society that has programmed him to do their seeding of
planets that they want him to do and goes out on his own to explore the galaxy

28:06.380 --> 28:09.080
or whatever he finds that meets his interest.

28:23.020 --> 28:33.380
Space exploration is the cornerstone of postulative fiction, for the Earth is
well known and has become a very small place in a very big universe. If man is

28:33.380 --> 28:42.260
to leave the Earth, as he has already begun to do, he will have to explore,
whether it's for the sake of exploring or for practical reasons of colonization

28:42.260 --> 28:51.540
and exploitation or both. Although there are science fiction stories that do not
deal in off-Earth settings, the majority by far are based on the assumption of

28:51.540 --> 28:59.040
space travel and exploration, as we try to imagine what could lie ahead for
humanity in the worlds of tomorrow.

29:06.100 --> 29:16.180
This is David Crews, Daryl Lane, and David Carson. This has been the Science
Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction
