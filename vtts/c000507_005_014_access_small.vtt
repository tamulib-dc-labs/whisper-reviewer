00:01.140 --> 00:08.220
Okay. I sort of know the answer to this question already because you made it kind of plain,

00:08.300 --> 00:13.240
but just for the listeners on the show. The alien races that are contacted the songs,

00:14.480 --> 00:19.340
you portrayed all of these people, you know, civilizations, galaxies away being destroyed.

00:20.100 --> 00:25.860
And then you let Lou and Sue know that. Wouldn't that cause a futility in their quest, you

00:25.860 --> 00:29.760
know, where they're going to unite the earth and go for the stars? If they know that any

00:29.760 --> 00:31.580
civilization even that advance is going to end.

00:34.540 --> 00:39.420
Well, yes and no, I suppose. I mean, that is the existential position of all people,

00:39.440 --> 00:49.240
really, and the timeframe of talking about it's millions of years. Well, everybody already

00:49.240 --> 00:58.260
knows that the lifespan of the universe of the sun or whatever is finite. I didn't want it to be a

00:58.260 --> 01:04.240
bunny rabbit story. And that is why I put that in there. I mean, it kills, you know,

01:04.280 --> 01:10.060
it kills Parker. He can't take it. They can. That because they can deal with that existential

01:10.060 --> 01:17.200
reality as those other civilizations could. Okay. This is sort of a general question.

01:17.280 --> 01:25.080
It refers to songs from the stars, but also your other works. In the way you treat the

01:25.080 --> 01:28.760
media. I think almost every novel you've read is had something to do with the media.

01:31.460 --> 01:36.540
I take it that you would be having an ambivalent attitude toward the use of the media. If it's

01:36.540 --> 01:40.700
done properly, it's great. If it's used for the wrong kind of power, it's bad. Like Sue, for

01:40.700 --> 01:45.600
instance, uses it to sort of make a media hype, you know, where they dress up the Harker as an

01:45.600 --> 01:50.920
alien and try to sell it to the people and so forth. In other words, if it serves a good purpose,

01:50.920 --> 01:58.040
also like in the electronic democracy in a world between media is a good thing. If it's used

01:58.040 --> 02:03.680
properly, would that be a media is a powerful is it is a powerful tool? It's a very powerful tool.

02:03.740 --> 02:09.860
It's the most powerful political tool ever invented, among other things. And my attitude towards

02:09.860 --> 02:14.080
that is the same as my attitude towards power power is morally neutral. The media is morally

02:14.080 --> 02:20.340
neutral. It all depends on what you do with it. People, people do good things. People do bad

02:20.340 --> 02:25.560
things. There are tools don't do good things or bad things. And this is just a very, very powerful

02:25.560 --> 02:30.060
tool. That's why I've written books in which it's used for good and I've written books in which

02:30.060 --> 02:39.340
it's used for evil. And I've written books in which it's used for both. And you'd probably say the

02:39.340 --> 02:49.500
same thing about the treatment of science. Tool. That's why I've written books in which it's used

02:49.500 --> 02:56.940
for good and I've written books in which it's used for evil. And I've written books in which it's

02:56.940 --> 03:02.180
used for both. And you'd probably say the same thing about the treatment of science.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.540
This is the tool like the media. Yeah, sciences. If you look, maybe that's the ultimate,

03:08.460 --> 03:12.360
maybe that's what's ultimately wrong, the error of transcendental sciences, that they look,

03:12.360 --> 03:19.440
is looking to science as a moral guide or as a, you know, as a guide for

03:20.120 --> 03:24.180
the interest of philosophical or personal or emotional quest. I don't think science is supposed

03:24.180 --> 03:30.580
to be that at all. Contrary to what I don't think that people's emotions or feelings or

03:32.720 --> 03:39.160
fears are very good guides to scientific research either. I think science is there to

03:40.420 --> 03:47.720
get out factual truths and create instrumentalities of physical power and that's what it does. And

03:47.720 --> 03:53.180
it's not, it's again, it's morally neutral. It's what people do with it that counts. But if you

03:53.180 --> 03:59.460
try and make science into a philosophy, science itself becomes your philosophy, then you really

03:59.460 --> 04:06.420
have an empty philosophy because science is not designed or meant to deal with more philosophical

04:06.420 --> 04:12.260
questions. Okay, one, one episode you had, it was a minor one, but it was in the world between

04:12.260 --> 04:19.940
that impressed me. I'm sorry, right in a world between. You call this sort of utopia novel

04:19.940 --> 04:26.080
already, at least on Pacifica, the planet. Royce's flying boat, he's out there, he's out there sailing,

04:26.220 --> 04:30.160
first of all, looks like a regular sailing boat, and it's an idyllic scene in the islands and the

04:30.160 --> 04:35.340
ocean and stuff. Then when he has to get back, it becomes a supersonic flyer in a matter of minutes.

04:36.020 --> 04:42.220
That kind of blend of technology and the clean blue world was, I took that as a sort of a

04:42.220 --> 04:48.260
meaningful thing. I'm not sure you meant it that way or not. Well, I mean, on Pacifica,

04:48.260 --> 04:52.660
transportation is aesthetic. In other words, if you want to have to spend time traveling,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.460
simply as you might as well enjoy it. That's why I hate to 55 mile an hour speed one.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.700
I enjoy driving good cars fast, among other things like that. Yeah, I don't think that

05:06.080 --> 05:14.180
technology is the enemy of a clean, well-run world far from it. Again, science is a tool,

05:14.240 --> 05:19.120
if you understand it completely. So many people call themselves economists, as if it's a philosophy

05:19.120 --> 05:25.540
or political orientation when it's really a name for a certain branch of science,

05:25.880 --> 05:27.040
of which these people know nothing.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.320
And the only way that you can have an ecologically sound,

05:36.640 --> 05:42.560
soundly managed planet is by having a scientific knowledge of what that takes and what it is.

05:43.460 --> 05:50.080
And by using the necessary technology to have a good human environment that doesn't conflict

05:50.080 --> 05:55.860
with having a good natural environment. There's much more unanimity among the people who are

05:55.860 --> 06:00.920
attacking the new wave as being a coherent school than there was among people who were being labeled

06:00.920 --> 06:09.640
as a new wave. Okay, great. Yeah, that's the kind of thing we like to hear. The reading I've been

06:09.640 --> 06:13.880
doing of your saying the locus and some writing interviews you've had and other publications

06:13.880 --> 06:20.240
and so forth. You seem to be saying that the separation between science fiction and mainstream

06:20.240 --> 06:24.300
is sort of an artificial thing that's been created by publishers and fans and so forth.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.980
Would that be your position? Would I be correct in stating it that way?

06:29.060 --> 06:33.700
Well, I would generalize it more. I think modern American publishing is all categories.

06:34.240 --> 06:40.520
Everything is a category. Science fiction, westerns, bestsellers, literary books, they're all

06:40.900 --> 06:44.700
categorized. There's no such thing as a general novel. Everything is packaged in a way to look

06:44.700 --> 06:48.460
like something. How many times do you see a book that comes out that says bestseller? The book has

06:48.460 --> 06:52.860
just come out, but it's labeled the bestseller because that's the category. There are many

06:52.860 --> 06:57.960
unsuccessful bestsellers, strangers that may seem, because they use that as a category. It's a book

06:57.960 --> 07:01.820
it means they do a certain kind of package, they promote it a certain kind of way,

07:02.540 --> 07:06.980
and they want a certain kind of book and that's a bestseller. And a great many things that are

07:06.980 --> 07:13.400
called bestsellers. So they're not really bestsellers. Same thing with so-called literary books.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.820
Literary books are packaged in a certain way to appeal to a certain small audience,

07:17.180 --> 07:20.400
to draw the attention of the people who do the New York Times book reviews,

07:20.400 --> 07:25.100
and that's a genre too. It's not something that's simply been done to science fiction,

07:25.560 --> 07:30.820
it's done to every kind of literature published in the United States today. Everything is a

07:30.820 --> 07:35.940
category. But haven't you said though that like I got the impression in one of your columns that

07:35.940 --> 07:39.980
you felt that science fiction wasn't being treated fairly, say by the book reviewers, the people who

07:39.980 --> 07:44.880
could do it? No, it isn't. It is, you know, as a category, you know, it is treats very, very

07:44.880 --> 07:52.700
unfairly and very cavalierly by the powers that be, which is mainly the New York Times book review

07:52.700 --> 07:58.120
and the New York Review of Books and the so-called New York Literary Establishment, which really does

07:58.120 --> 08:03.860
have a very heavy effect on the way books are published. These people, for instance, came down

08:03.860 --> 08:08.060
on the American Book Awards, succeeded in getting science fiction knocked out of the American Book

08:08.060 --> 08:13.980
Awards. A real small clique of people in New York City who felt that it was really bad to have

08:13.980 --> 08:18.780
these awards given to things like science fiction, that it was bad to take it away from a small

08:18.780 --> 08:24.860
jury which they could control and have thousands of people voting for. A very elitist, social fascist

08:24.860 --> 08:30.680
bunch of people who I absolutely no use for and I'm sure they have no use for me. Well, they've

08:30.680 --> 08:35.980
certainly demonstrated that. I've been mentioned in the New York Times Book Review twice, once

08:36.400 --> 08:41.920
when the Iron Dream was in America, it was a National Book Award Recommendee. And once when I

08:41.920 --> 08:46.020
was nominated for the American Book Award, neither of those books, which are forced to mention because

08:46.020 --> 08:53.600
it was news, was ever reviewed in that rank. And I've forgotten the general attitude of these

08:53.600 --> 08:59.000
people towards science fiction. Has a science fiction book or anything close to it ever won or

08:59.000 --> 09:03.160
been nominated for consideration for the award that you know of? Well, a classic case was that the

09:03.160 --> 09:07.020
National Book Award, our Leslie Fiedler won in my book. There were only three judges,

09:07.020 --> 09:12.240
the three judge panel at that time. Well, Fiedler wanted it considered for the award and it was on

09:12.240 --> 09:17.640
the initial list because of him. The other two judges refused to read it because it was science

09:17.640 --> 09:23.980
fiction. They refused to read it. So that's that's that's how much chance you have of

09:24.560 --> 09:29.300
of winning one of those awards in competition with other but they actually refused to read it.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.200
I didn't find this out until years later when Fiedler was being interviewed on a Buckley show,

09:33.200 --> 09:37.520
William Buckley show. And to all this story, I had no idea that that had happened, but it did

09:37.520 --> 09:44.380
happen. Things may be a little bit different now, but they're probably not. You're talking sort of

09:44.380 --> 09:49.860
packaging and categories here, but you think if this kind of packaging or a category approach to

09:49.860 --> 09:56.960
literature were removed that science fiction would among, I don't know, scholarly people or whatever,

09:57.200 --> 10:01.540
that it would have a higher reputation or it would be as equal to mainstream material?

10:01.540 --> 10:04.460
Well, if categories were removed, there wouldn't be any categories.

10:05.360 --> 10:10.800
And people would judge books not on what the content is, but how well it's handled.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.060
I mean, it's pretty, you know, if you come to think, if you think about it, it's pretty

10:15.060 --> 10:19.660
pretty unlikely to say that because you're writing about the future, because you're writing about

10:20.640 --> 10:26.260
a world that isn't or using speculative material that necessarily all the books that are written

10:26.260 --> 10:32.380
that way are going to be inferior to contemporary novels in terms of the writing, in terms of how

10:32.380 --> 10:36.820
good it is. And if there weren't any categories, books should be judged on their relative qualities

10:36.820 --> 10:42.540
and not on their content. What about Europe? I understand that you do very well over there,

10:42.760 --> 10:46.400
your reputation. Do they do it differently? I mean, do they categorize that way too?

10:46.680 --> 10:51.590
Well, they don't. France is my best country and that's a good example. And there, every book is

10:51.590 --> 10:57.650
also categorized. In other words, they have what they call collections. Every publisher has

10:57.650 --> 11:01.650
various collections of novels. They'll have a science fiction collection. What they'll have a

11:01.650 --> 11:05.570
collection of so-called mainstream novels is something that is the collection of a particular

11:05.570 --> 11:10.410
editor who even has a name on the collection. So this collection reflects this editor's taste

11:10.410 --> 11:17.550
and it's labeled that way and it's given a name. So in a sense, everything is categorized. But there's

11:18.350 --> 11:23.430
approbation between the categories. Since everything is categorized under a name chosen by the,

11:23.770 --> 11:29.370
you know, to identify this line, this bunch of books with the editor was actually editing them,

11:30.310 --> 11:35.630
there's not so much stigma, stigma, having a category because everything is that kind of

11:36.170 --> 11:41.590
category. Although everything is categorized, the categories are a bit more equal. Also,

11:41.650 --> 11:45.590
they give you a lot, you know, they have much more respect. They seem to, you know,

11:45.590 --> 11:49.630
they understand that there's no particular, you know, that a lot of everything is crap.

11:50.130 --> 11:53.330
But there's no particular reason why a science fiction novel shouldn't be as good as anything

11:53.330 --> 11:58.470
else. It's still be a science fiction novel. It's that good. And so while they do still pay attention

11:58.470 --> 12:02.970
to categories, they do not automatically discount something because it's science fiction.

12:04.270 --> 12:07.750
I was talking to a friend of mine this morning who was over in Europe a few years ago and

12:08.470 --> 12:12.270
he said, you know, that he'd noticed many books by, you know, you over their translations.

12:12.270 --> 12:16.970
But yet he had not read you over here, which implied to me that you must be better known or at

12:16.970 --> 12:21.510
least more appreciated. Well, I just came back from three weeks in France doing book publicity

12:21.510 --> 12:29.910
in Paris and publicity for the record I made there. And, you know, I think not only am I,

12:30.110 --> 12:36.050
not only do I think that I am more, you know, relatively more known in France than I am here,

12:36.090 --> 12:40.370
but I think that writers in general are more important in France than they are here.

12:42.270 --> 12:47.030
Writing is more, literature is more central to the popular culture of France, say,

12:47.510 --> 12:51.410
than it is to the popular culture of the United States in general. People have a different

12:51.410 --> 12:56.350
attitude towards, towards writing and towards writers. There's a certain generalized American

12:56.350 --> 13:02.790
anti-intellectualism anyway. This does not exist in France. And in other European countries,

13:03.130 --> 13:11.990
this, this, this atmosphere of anti-intellectualism. And so writers in general are, are, are, are

13:11.990 --> 13:17.090
considered more important in science fiction. It's a different, it's a deep cultural attitude,

13:17.190 --> 13:21.610
I think, that reflects partly the fact that my book is more popular there, partly the fact that,

13:21.730 --> 13:27.810
that it's more important to be writer. Okay, what about this, on this question of

13:27.810 --> 13:32.230
science, how it's considered by the, by the public and so forth. Do you think the movies

13:32.230 --> 13:38.030
and television hurt the image of science fiction? I mean, to be treated as a serious litter?

13:56.770 --> 13:59.090
Do you think they, they detract or hurt it?

14:00.890 --> 14:05.830
Oh, I don't know. I don't think they, not really. I mean, the image of science fiction,

14:06.050 --> 14:11.750
in that respect, has been very bad anyway. I don't think the movies really add to the

14:11.750 --> 14:11.970
image of science fiction. I mean, I think they, they are not, they are not, they are

14:11.970 --> 14:15.330
not, I don't think they detract from it either. If there are some better, more sophisticated

14:15.330 --> 14:21.790
movies, they might help. As it is, it's just kind of neutral publicity, people more aware that it

14:21.790 --> 14:27.310
exists. I think it's positive, and it will prove to be positive in the long range, because a lot

14:27.310 --> 14:31.050
of people are being introduced to the imagery of science fiction, with which they are unfamiliar

14:31.050 --> 14:36.390
through these movies. And now if you look at the evolution in the movies, you find that in

14:36.390 --> 14:40.150
the earlier science fiction movies, if you're going into space or whatever, you had to spend

14:40.150 --> 14:44.210
like half an hour setting the thing, this is a spaceship, it takes off from the earth,

14:44.230 --> 14:48.830
people float around it, you know, and you have to familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar

14:48.830 --> 14:54.950
imagery. Now they can just start a movie bang right off, in a galaxy far away. Boom. Here's a

14:54.950 --> 14:58.450
spaceship in the stromo pow, you know, in other words, the first half hour of the conventional

14:58.450 --> 15:02.270
old prime science fiction movie is gone, because people are now familiar with this

15:02.270 --> 15:08.210
imagery. And I think these movies have brought a lot of new people into familiarity with these

15:08.210 --> 15:14.930
images. They made these images part of the popular culture. These movies are mainly aimed at kids

15:14.930 --> 15:22.690
and adolescents. And years from now, assuming that these people ever read anything, they'll be ready

15:22.690 --> 15:28.570
to read science fiction of a more serious kind, assuming they're ready to read literature of a

15:28.570 --> 15:32.870
more serious kind or a lot, because they'll be familiar with the material, familiar with the

15:32.870 --> 15:36.310
literature, it won't seem strange and weird to them, because they will have grown up with it.

15:36.810 --> 15:42.570
That's why I think magazines, even magazines like Star Wars, in that sense, will have a

15:42.570 --> 15:46.650
long term positive impact. Okay, listen, David.

15:51.770 --> 15:55.690
Okay, why did why did you want the job as president?

15:56.770 --> 16:04.040
Why did I want the job as president? I don't know. That's really a hard question to answer. I don't

16:04.040 --> 16:07.880
know. I was somebody who had to do it, because I thought I was the most qualified person to do it at the time.

16:11.740 --> 16:15.060
Because I've been involved in the organization until the beginning. I've been vice president.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.780
I've been the grievance chairman. And I've always, sometimes, felt that it was going off in wrong

16:19.780 --> 16:24.920
and stupid directions. And finally, I felt that there were a certain number of things that I could

16:24.920 --> 16:28.740
get done in this period, and then this was the time to do it. I always felt I was the president of

16:28.740 --> 16:34.500
things sooner or later. And this just seemed to be the right time to do it. Jack Williams had been

16:34.500 --> 16:39.120
president, and he had dealt with a lot of internal bickering and things like that, which I wasn't

16:39.120 --> 16:42.740
interested in dealing with at all. I think one of the flaws of the organization had always been that

16:42.740 --> 16:47.200
it was too inward looking, and I wanted to see it more outward looking. So we have to jack it,

16:47.240 --> 16:51.040
