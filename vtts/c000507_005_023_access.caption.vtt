00:01.320 --> 00:13.020
Words and Pictures, or possibly words versus pictures, with particular reference
to science fiction as the subject of our discussion today, with me are Theodore

00:13.020 --> 00:23.720
Sturgeon, whose stature as a writer we have noted in the past. His most recent
collection of stories is called Visions and Venturers. Lloyd Biggle, a writer

00:23.720 --> 00:31.860
currently on the faculty at Eastern Michigan University. His stories have
appeared widely in various science fiction magazines, including the new Omni,

00:31.920 --> 00:43.500
and he has had some 14 books published. And James R. Odbert, an illustrator,
whose work has accompanied stories by Theodore Sturgeon, including the new

00:43.500 --> 00:57.940
Visions and Venturers, and any number of other science fiction writers. He hails
from Minneapolis, where I understand Gordon Dickson also comes from. Gordon

00:57.940 --> 01:10.300
Dickson's new book, Pro, was illustrated by Mr. Odbert. Jim, what, in your view,
is the role of the illustrator, particularly in science fiction? Are you a

01:10.300 --> 01:19.400
crutch for the author or an equal? Well, not an equal, but I certainly hope not
a crutch.

01:23.320 --> 01:36.640
I feel the illustrator should embellish the story. He adds to it, gives it more
richness and depth with the illustrations, particularly if he can work closely

01:36.640 --> 01:42.700
with the author so that he can let

01:42.700 --> 01:54.800
you see things that the author did not describe but had in mind when he was
doing the story. I've mentioned Gordon Dickson. Was he influential in getting you

01:54.800 --> 02:06.140
started, let's say, in illustrating science fiction? Well, he was influential in
getting me into the book illustration part of it. I've been doing illustration

02:06.140 --> 02:17.540
for quite some time, but when I got into the books, Gordy was very influential
in getting me started in book illustration. What other kinds of work have you

02:17.540 --> 02:25.180
done? My basis was

02:25.180 --> 02:33.780
in industrial design, which actually works nicely into illustration,
particularly the hardware and the technical end of it. Do you find it difficult

02:33.780 --> 02:37.560
on occasion to do something to accompany a story?

02:40.560 --> 02:56.400
Not really. More it's difficult finding the real feel of the story and doing the
illustration to fit the feel. The things are not difficult. It's the feeling

02:56.400 --> 03:11.020
that's harder to find and to bring across. There have been very few really great
illustrators down through the years. In my own experience, I'm reminded of N.C.

03:11.200 --> 03:22.940
Wyeth and people like that illustrating Stephenson and other writers, but their
names simply don't stand out, and I guess one reason is that not too many of the

03:22.940 --> 03:36.140
older books actually contained illustrations, or very few illustrations. So
often today one gets the impression that the illustration is an aide to the

03:36.140 --> 03:48.740
child or perhaps the semi-literate adult in getting him over the problem of
reading. How do you feel about that, Mr. Sturgeon? In an interesting time, we

03:48.740 --> 03:56.680
have had a long time now we haven't had any illustrations at all. Earlier,
however, they did. I can remember turn-of-the-century books that always had a

03:56.680 --> 04:05.200
Francis piece, and often then these very careful steel engravings and woodcuts
and things like that all the way through. We got away from that. We're getting

04:05.200 --> 04:14.920
back to it again. And more and more you'll find interior illustrations in books.
And some publishers and editors, like Byron Price in New York, are doing a whole

04:14.920 --> 04:23.900
series of novels which are almost half and half illustration and copy, which is
very interesting. I want to hand a palm to Mr. Odbert here. He's Jim Odbert.

04:24.040 --> 04:35.500
He really and truly reads what he illustrates. it happens that this copy of
Visions and Ventures fell into my hands last night for the very first time the

04:35.500 --> 04:44.040
local B. Dalton bookstore made a special effort and got them out pre-publication
it'll probably be out generally next week but they got into stock how I don't

04:44.040 --> 04:54.920
know I've tried to do this myself and failed and the manager down there is
really on top of it so I had my first look at it and at Jim's drawings last

04:54.920 --> 05:05.180
night I was very, very pleased He clearly has carefully read each story And as
he said, the feel of it He's gotten that over very well indeed Where I write

05:05.180 --> 05:14.040
horror, he's got a horror drawing Where it tends to be more mechanistic In a
computer story, for example It's neat and it's laid out And you immediately get

05:14.040 --> 05:23.100
the feel of the story You did not work with him No In the preparation of the art
No, in this case, no I haven't I've been all across the spectrum with artists

05:23.100 --> 05:32.440
working Sometimes not knowing who they are Some of them I never did find out who
they were. And in other cases, I've written stories from a painting, an editor

05:32.440 --> 05:41.080
will buy a painting he likes, and say, hey, I've got no story to go with this. I
want to get into that subject in just a moment. But let me ask you, first of

05:41.080 --> 05:52.100
all, Lloyd Biggle, do you have a feeling sometimes that illustrations have a
tendency to drive out good writing, perhaps? I had an interesting experience

05:52.100 --> 06:02.660
with a novel of mine called The Light That Never Was, which coincidentally is a
novel about art, and the cover painting for the paperback book was done by Kelly

06:02.660 --> 06:14.620
Freese, who was excellent. And the scene that he drew for the cover painting
does not occur in the book anywhere. But in that scene, he delineates one of the

06:14.620 --> 06:22.980
major themes of the novel beautifully. The cover could stand entirely by itself.
It tells its own story, which is entirely different from the story of my novel,

06:23.160 --> 06:32.340
but it delineates the theme of the novel. And with the novel, of course, in
conjunction, then it means something additional. Now, if he had done a series of

06:32.340 --> 06:41.540
interior drawings on that nature, the reader would have been horribly confused
because, again, they would have nothing to do with the story, even if he caught

06:41.540 --> 06:54.180
the theme in some way of what the story was about. So in your view, it did add?
It did add under those circumstances. as the cover, yes. You know, there's an

06:54.180 --> 07:08.200
interesting parallel. We in radio all these years have been convinced that it's
an ideal medium for the imaginative as opposed to, let's say, a film or

07:08.200 --> 07:19.920
television. In other words, you leave so much up to the imagination of the
listener and you don't spell it out for him. And translating some stories into

07:19.920 --> 07:29.420
either medium and they can be done very well in radio, but they're ruined the
minute you see it. Now, isn't this true to some degree of a science fiction

07:29.420 --> 07:38.960
story, that the minute you illustrate it, you take away from the reader the
opportunity to make a concept of his own? Well, this is true. Let's say a

07:38.960 --> 07:48.480
picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes the reader's imagination is
worth 10,000 words. So it happens that way. Also, it works both ways as far as

07:48.480 --> 07:59.200
art and illustration. if you can make a differentiation between the two, I have
a French edition of my novel More than Human illustrated by a French artist, the

07:59.200 --> 08:10.060
name is Girard. The guy is an extraordinary artist, and the illustrations, the
pictures in the book are good art, but poor illustration. I mean, they don't

08:10.060 --> 08:14.380
have that, as you said, quality of feel, or the feel they have is not the same
as the feel of the story.

08:17.400 --> 08:32.000
Once again, when you're illustrating a story, it's sometimes very important not
to add too much to the story, or to give away the story, particularly in short

08:32.000 --> 08:47.440
stories. You have to be very careful not to give away the punch line, or the end
of the story in advance. There's one in Visions and Ventures that after I read

08:47.440 --> 08:58.360
the story the immediate illustration that sprung into my mind looked very nice
and everything, and I realized I couldn't do it because it would tell the

08:58.360 --> 09:04.320
punchline at the end of the story before it

09:04.320 --> 09:15.780
would just be anticlimactic when they read the story. Do you differentiate in
your own mind between, as Mr. Sturgeon has said, a work of art and an

09:15.780 --> 09:31.620
illustration? No. No. I don't. An illustration can be a work of art. Let me put
it. An illustration should be a work of art. Not can be, but it really should

09:31.620 --> 09:42.360
be. Not all works of arts are illustration. but a good illustration should be a
work of art I absolutely agree with you with that the differentiation I made

09:42.360 --> 09:54.880
particularly is one in that French book struck me particularly because nobody
could fault the man as an artist his black and whites are simply extraordinary

09:54.880 --> 10:04.680
he used a combination of I think fine pen and airbrush in black and white and
simply amazing work that he did but they were not good illustrations as far as

10:04.680 --> 10:15.680
the story was concerned. No, I have of course, well the ones that you mention
Wyeth, for example, I remember he did a... do you remember Howard Pyle's book of

10:15.680 --> 10:22.700
pirates? Uh-huh, yes. Didn't Fayet do those illustrations? I think so. They were
gorgeous illustrations and real art, there are no question about it.

10:28.420 --> 10:44.560
Way back when novels were first coming out and illustration was part of it,
Gustav Do Titus Yeah. Oh, my word. And he's still referred to as an illustrator,

10:45.580 --> 11:01.780
but these are works of art, and too many people... I don't think you can
differentiate between artist and illustrator. Not really. A good illustrator is

11:01.780 --> 11:12.380
an artist. Not all artists are good illustrators. Again, it's a subclass. So you
can have marvelous art that is not illustrated. That was just my point. In this

11:12.380 --> 11:22.800
case of fine art, it was not a good illustrator. There are many times certain
illustrations by a particular illustrator become very much identified with the

11:22.800 --> 11:34.760
story and with the character. I mean, Dickens or Alice in Wonderland, other
illustrators have tried to illustrate them. Oh no, Alice without any

11:34.760 --> 11:45.620
illustrations. But the original will probably always simply accompany that
story. I really feel that a lot of that is that it's a great story, which

11:45.620 --> 11:59.480
inspires the first artist to get their hands on it. And the definition, the
identification is with the first man that does it. And if he does it properly

11:59.480 --> 12:17.380
nobody else can do it. Deserved to be repeated. No. Lloyd, Mr. Sturgeon a moment
ago mentioned this business of commissioning a story to go along with an already

12:17.380 --> 12:28.700
prepared illustration. And you've written about this in one of the introductions
to your stories. What's your feeling about this? You think this is degrading the

12:28.700 --> 12:37.580
writer? I thought it was a challenge to try it. I've just done it once. I don't
think I would like to write very much. I'd rather make my own pictures. Well,

12:37.620 --> 12:48.520
you come over to the other side of the field for a while. This is what we do all
the time. I've always found the same thing as a challenge. I've done it a number

12:48.520 --> 12:58.360
of times. As a matter of fact, one of the stories in Visions and Venturers, One
Foot in the Grave, Weird Tales bought a cover, a very strange painting by, I

12:58.360 --> 13:08.700
think, Joe Pugnani. and nobody could make any sense of it, the editor had bought
it because he liked it. And I had the job of writing a story into it and it

13:08.700 --> 13:20.920
wasn't easy, but I got it all in. In this new book of yours, Visions and
Venturers, is the cover illustration done by you? No. It's done by a different

13:20.920 --> 13:29.220
person. And I noticed that in the Gordon Dickson Pro, which I have in front of me,
there again, the cover illustration is by someone else. does that create

13:29.220 --> 13:43.540
problems? Yes it does. Part of the reason that I do not do a lot of color work,
I'm partially color blind. No kidding. No, true. Isn't that something? And the

13:43.540 --> 13:52.520
balance of black and white is what I feel I do best and what I enjoy doing most.
You certainly do it well, there's no question about. But the person that did the

13:52.520 --> 14:06.300
cover on Pro had never seen my black and white interiors when he did the cover,
and as a result it's particularly noticeable on the hero who's in the front and

14:06.300 --> 14:19.420
on the aliens in the background because Gordy and I worked very long and hard on
trying to figure out just what the aliens looked like. And the cover alien is

14:19.420 --> 14:30.020
something entirely different. I noticed the uniform on the man in there is
different from the uniform that you have him wearing. So the cover, I suppose,

14:30.140 --> 14:42.200
is there to get you inside the story and then once you're inside the illustrator
is going to have to be much closer to the story. You know, the thing is that the

14:42.200 --> 14:54.080
cover should be able to draw you in and truly reflect the story. Too often the
cover has nothing to do with the story. mm-hmm it's a grabber yeah that that's

14:54.080 --> 15:05.720
that's essentially all it's they're attempting to do is to put something there
that looks science fictiony that will grab your eye and make you pick it up and

15:05.720 --> 15:17.660
read it and i i really don't have any objections with them wanting you wanting
to grab you and make you pick it up and read it but i think they should be able

15:17.660 --> 15:31.720
to do it and truly reflect what's inside the book I think that too many people
sometimes get this really bad feeling because the cover and the book do not

15:31.720 --> 15:44.220
reflect one another Gordon Dickson isn't here to defend himself but I'd like to
just use this as a kickoff for a discussion of this business of working the

15:44.220 --> 15:57.080
author, working together with the illustrator In his book Pro, well, right here
on page two, for instance, he says, in her white slacks and shirt with only the

15:57.080 --> 16:05.740
med service badge for color on the pocket, she was a vibrant sight, her hair was
as black as obsidian, etc. And I look across the page at your illustration and

16:05.740 --> 16:17.420
denote that the med service badge is on her sleeve rather than her pocket. But
then I went on to read and everywhere else through the book, Gordon Dickson refers

16:17.420 --> 16:28.160
to the patch as being on the sleeve. And this raises an interesting question. Is
this our forgetful authors? No, no, it's just that the lady had two shirts. Two

16:28.160 --> 16:39.560
shirts. And that has happened, you know? It's perfectly understandable, but I
was just struck by that right at the beginning. I'll tell the funnier one than

16:39.560 --> 16:50.820
that on myself. I did a novel called The Still Small Voice of Trumpets, in which
i very carefully designed uh an alien trumpet and i insisted when they were

16:50.820 --> 17:02.480
going to put the trumpeter on the jacket of the hardcover edition that i approve
the drawing first so the we had these one arm trumpet players and the he drew

17:02.480 --> 17:11.820
one of those for the jacket so i very carefully went over the trumpet and made
certain and exchanged letters with the artist and got that trumpet exactly the

17:11.820 --> 17:21.060
way that I wanted it and we were all pleased and several years later someone
came to me and said why is a trumpeter holding his trumpet in the wrong hand and

17:21.060 --> 17:29.520
I had completely overlooked the fact that all these trumpeters were missing the
left arm and the artist drew a trumpeter holding the trumpet in his left arm

17:30.540 --> 17:40.500
we've had other experiences like that have you not I think all authors have had
this kind of experience probably a second immediate subject But you have to, I

17:40.500 --> 17:54.800
think, quickly mention your career as a cellist. It's a funny story. Do you
mind? Yes. Well, I've been a clarinetist since I was nine years old, and I got

17:54.800 --> 18:05.680
an advanced copy of the Dust Jacket on a new novel which had a little biography
on it. And this means that Doubleday already had printed up enough for the first

18:05.680 --> 18:18.520
edition of the book, and they sent me a few. And the biography said, although he
now is a full time writer, he formerly was a musician and he still enjoys

18:18.520 --> 18:27.920
playing the cello and chamber music in his native state of Michigan. So I got a
hold of my editor at Doubleday and I said, I've been a clarinetist since I was

18:27.920 --> 18:34.800
nine years old. Where did you get the idea that I played the cello? And she
said, well, it's a beautiful instrument. And if you start lessons right now,

18:34.960 --> 18:44.820
perhaps by the time the book is published, we'll be telling the truth. So I
finally got things stopped so they would stop calling me a cellist, including

18:44.820 --> 18:54.040
catching the same error a couple of years later before it got into print and
then I got the British edition of this same book and the British publisher based

18:54.040 --> 19:04.980
the copy on the American edition and now I am an internationally famous cellist.
Well we'll invite you to perform. That's got to come along. Back on the other

19:04.980 --> 19:20.740
subject, there was, if I might put in one thing that helps, really, is that when
I went through and read another book I was illustrating, the author had two

19:20.740 --> 19:32.780
completely different descriptions in size of an alien in the front and the back,
and I caught it where the editors hadn't caught it or anything. because I was

19:32.780 --> 19:42.940
reading for illustrating. The editors were simply reading to correct. And in
that

19:42.940 --> 19:51.640
particular case, I was able to catch it pointed out, and they changed one so
that the two of them matched. This kind of thing is awfully easy to do in a 300

19:51.640 --> 20:00.120
-page book. It is indeed, or for that matter in a television show. I had that
experience in television too where one of my lines was knocked out of a... it

20:00.120 --> 20:09.280
was a Star Trek as a matter of fact because they brought in another actor and
they used a few more frames and they had to cut somewhere. So they cut that.

20:09.820 --> 20:17.680
They had their noses so close to the production that they overlooked the fact
that that particular line is the one that brought the entire plot into it. The

20:17.680 --> 20:25.920
only thing it made the entire plot mean anything so that without it the whole
show would have been absolutely nothing. And I happened to be on the set at the

20:25.920 --> 20:42.640
time and able to correct it. But you're not always that lucky. No, it's very
strange when you're reading a novel. I sit down with a pad and I will go through

20:42.640 --> 20:55.500
the manuscript and underscore descriptions of persons and write down. And I
haven't run across it yet, but I'm sure that someday I'll find that he has black

20:55.500 --> 21:09.100
hair in the beginning and by the end of the book he's a blonde. And it's very
easy to lose sight of the broad range when you're right down close to it. That's

21:09.100 --> 21:14.100
right. You'd think that when these errors are made, it's more often the fault of
the author than the illustrator.

21:17.420 --> 21:31.320
No, quite often the illustrator doesn't even have a manuscript. He's got some
art director that's told him the type of picture he wants, and he draws. There

21:31.320 --> 21:32.940
was another very interesting one.

21:36.520 --> 21:48.540
This was for one of Gordy's books. I was sitting talking to him, and he was very
unhappy with the cover that they had done for it. Very, very unhappy. And I'd

21:48.540 --> 21:58.960
read the story, so I had a pad in front, and I made a very quick sketch of maybe
two or three minutes and said, I'd always thought this would be kind of a nice

21:58.960 --> 22:09.540
cover, just a black-and-white sketch. And he said, I love it. Can I have a copy
of it? So I said, here, sure, take the original. So he turned around, without my

22:09.540 --> 22:17.440
knowledge, sent it off to the people that were putting the book, and they liked
it and wrote me back and asked if they could use it as the basis for a drawing.

22:17.800 --> 22:30.920
And I said, sure, no problem. So they did. Well, it's about a sword. And this
sword plays a prominent part in the cover sketch, which actually has two prongs

22:30.920 --> 22:45.020
coming out of a piece that covers the hand completely. They help it. It covers
the hand. And I had simply made two quick lines. When it came out on the cover,

22:45.160 --> 22:57.380
the illustrator had made it a saber that is wide as the two lines of the prongs
of the sword. Filled in between them and made it work. Because he had obviously

22:57.380 --> 23:08.660
not read the story, but here I had just two lines very quickly made, and he
closed them up. These gross errors are very disconcerting. Oh, they are, yeah.

23:09.040 --> 23:18.040
But so many of them, as you pointed out, are large errors that you have your
nose too close to it to be able to see. I've had a left-handed villain where the

23:18.040 --> 23:29.500
whole plot turned on his left-handedness, John wielding a knife with his right
hand, and six-fingered people described throughout a novel are drawn with five

23:29.500 --> 23:42.260
fingers Things like such Well, again I think this is because I think that the
illustrators really don't see the manuscripts They aren't even allowed to see

23:42.260 --> 23:55.580
them The art director comes in and describes what he wants and that's what he
gets Yeah, I think I wish it could be virtually a rigorous law or convention

23:55.580 --> 24:04.000
that the artists read. Also, the people who write book jackets, again, that
strays a little bit from the immediate subject, but my God, it ought to be in

24:04.000 --> 24:12.980
writers' contracts that the people who write blurbs on book jackets will have
read the copy of the book. Yes. Well, good. We can't blame either the

24:12.980 --> 24:22.400
illustrators or the authors, but the absent editors will have to take the blame
right here. You know, you do have a point there. It really should be up to an

24:22.400 --> 24:30.980
editor to go over the whole thing, complete the illustrations and the book, in
one final check to see that everything conforms. That really would solve the

24:30.980 --> 24:39.780
problem. You put your finger on it. I don't want to resolve myself or I've
pulled baubles like that and I have, changing the color of the hair or something

24:39.780 --> 24:51.140
or the stature. But it's up to an editor to jump on those things and they don't,
always. So occasionally a very good copy editor will catch such mistakes. And

24:51.140 --> 25:02.120
you receive a query when you get the copy-edited manuscript back saying his hair
is brown on page 14. Right, that is. Funk and Wagnell's company was always

25:02.120 --> 25:08.300
meticulous about that. Maybe because they were involved in Uncle Chris with
dictionaries and so on. They were staffed by a bunch of lexicographers.

25:10.900 --> 25:18.500
Was that you that had, Lloyd, that had, were a copy-editor

25:23.500 --> 25:36.760
caught an error in grammar in an alien language. Oh, me. I think that was
Stanley Smith. Yes, that's right. We were talking to Stanley yesterday, and he

25:36.760 --> 25:47.720
had made up an alien language. And the copy editor caught an error in grammar,
which they had deduced from reading the story. The copy editor was really on top

25:47.720 --> 26:05.440
of it. It seems like it's a very short step from illustrating science fiction
writing to stage design, costume design for films and television shows. Have you

26:05.440 --> 26:19.720
gone that step, Jim? No, I haven't gone into that at all. I would like to get
into it eventually, but as a full-time illustrator, I am fairly new to the

26:19.720 --> 26:29.860
field. I've only been full-time illustrating one year. Is that right? I've been
an artist for approximately 25 years professionally but full-time illustrator

26:29.860 --> 26:39.700
only for the past year. And so I haven't gotten into that yet. I'm looking
forward to it. The fans, however, if you go to a science fiction convention and

26:39.700 --> 26:50.960
see their costume ball, some of the costumes are absolutely beautiful and taken
from illustrations in science fiction magazines as well of course as television

26:50.960 --> 27:01.520
and the movies but some of them are absolutely breathtaking and very
meticulously done from the stories and from the illustrations in magazines well

27:01.520 --> 27:14.400
it's the fans that always pull us up short when we make mistakes it really is
they read much closer than I write. Gentlemen, it's been delightful talking with

27:14.400 --> 27:25.360
you. I want to thank you all very much for discussing this very important
subject of art illustration and science fiction writing. Theodore Sturgeon and

27:25.360 --> 27:34.420
Lloyd Biggle are present authors and illustrator James R. Odbert. Thank you for
joining me today. Thank you, Ray. Thank you very much. Thank you.
