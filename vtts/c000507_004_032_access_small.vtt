00:07.840 --> 00:09.560
Okay. Take a listen. How are you, Darrell?

00:10.020 --> 00:15.760
What? Testing 1234. Testing 1234567. Testing.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.180
How's Darrell? Does it sound okay?

00:19.160 --> 00:21.660
That's what he always heard, Darrell. Once he starts coming in as loud.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.580
Oh, wait a minute. I'll get you tried again.

00:24.660 --> 00:25.460
Testing 1234.

00:26.980 --> 00:27.760
Hello, testing.

00:27.760 --> 00:36.160
Hello, testing 4321. 4321 testing. Testing some more 12344321.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.380
I think we can adjust the rest of it. That's tops.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.000
Okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.360
Your name is pronounced Saberhagen, correct?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.600
Saberhagen, yes. I have a tennis theory to say Saberhagen.

00:58.820 --> 00:59.760
I guess other people do too.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.420
There are many variations. But Saberhagen is what they taught me when I was a kid.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.160
Yeah, that's good.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.760
Oh, we ready? Are we rolling?

01:11.060 --> 01:11.480
Yeah, we're rolling.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.060
Oh, should we go?

01:13.820 --> 01:17.700
Yeah. Did you tell them what basic format this is going to be?

01:18.840 --> 01:19.460
What do you mean?

01:20.120 --> 01:20.920
How are we going to do the interview?

01:21.120 --> 01:21.620
Oh, I thought we were.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.220
Oh, yeah.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.900
Mr. Saberhagen, could you tell us some things about your origins as a writer?

01:30.880 --> 01:34.180
Do I understand it that you did not start out as a science fiction writer?

01:35.400 --> 01:35.840
Saberhagen.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.360
Saberhagen, let me try again.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.700
Did I say Saberhagen?

01:38.960 --> 01:39.100
Yeah.

01:39.260 --> 01:39.700
Sorry, okay.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.080
Mr. Saberhagen, would you tell us a little about your origins as a writer?

01:45.800 --> 01:49.480
I understand that you did not start out writing science fiction.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.740
Well, no. The first thing I wrote and sold was science fiction.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.020
And actually, I did. My writing career did start with science fiction.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.140
And through this, I got a job at Encyclopedia Britannica.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.760
I was on the editorial staff for five or six years.

02:09.380 --> 02:14.280
They were bringing out their, in the early, in the late 60s and early 70s,

02:14.280 --> 02:18.360
they had this complete revision of the whole set.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.700
And they hired many writers and editors for that.

02:22.680 --> 02:31.800
No, I started writing before I got into, like, I can't say I got into fandom.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.800
Writing science fiction was where it started.

02:41.320 --> 02:46.780
Okay. You said you did not, you didn't come out of the fan structure of science fiction.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.480
You do your work once a week.

02:47.480 --> 02:52.100
No, I had written and sold a story, or a couple of stories, I guess,

02:52.200 --> 02:57.620
before I knew there were such things as fan clubs and conventions and all this.

02:58.300 --> 03:01.300
Did you read much science fiction before you started writing it?

03:02.240 --> 03:07.140
Yeah, I read, when I was very young, when I was like eight or nine years old,

03:07.420 --> 03:14.080
I came upon this old pulp magazine, secondhand magazine someplace,

03:14.080 --> 03:16.560
and there were a couple of stories, and they were really impressed me.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.620
I think they scared the daylights out of me, actually.

03:21.060 --> 03:27.140
And I was, magazines of that kind were prohibited for a while from being right into the house,

03:27.860 --> 03:31.960
because I guess I was sort of turned inside out by some of these things.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.080
But then I just, you know, kind of went away from it for a few years.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.200
When I was about sixteen, I started haunting the secondhand magazine shops,

03:43.400 --> 03:48.160
which they then had in Chicago, and picking up old copies of Astounding,

03:49.600 --> 03:51.000
which as it was then called.

03:53.020 --> 03:57.760
And then I didn't really get into writing until later on.

03:57.880 --> 04:07.460
I was in the Air Force in my twenties, and I would, I had a lot of time on my hands.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.960
I would make a stab at it now and then.

04:10.980 --> 04:18.980
And still, I guess I didn't have access to a typewriter and all this privacy and so on.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.240
And still nothing really came of it.

04:23.600 --> 04:35.120
And I was in, I see I was almost thirty before I actually sat down and seriously wrote a story

04:35.120 --> 04:39.160
and really typed out the manuscript properly and got it.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.840
Okay, when it sent it off to be sold.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.260
And then I started selling, I didn't sell everything I wrote,

04:47.380 --> 04:49.320
but I started selling some things right away.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.600
And from then on it's been my main occupation.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.040
Not always a full-time job, but it's what I've done.

04:59.620 --> 05:02.960
You've never done any mainstream writing at all that was published?

05:05.060 --> 05:11.600
No, I don't, I guess when you say mainstream,

05:11.880 --> 05:21.080
I guess I'm coming to think more and more of mainstream as a kind of an offshoot of writing or literature,

05:21.340 --> 05:29.880
whatever you call it, where you're limited to things that could only happen with a high probability

05:29.880 --> 05:33.660
in the next block or in the next two months or something like that.

05:35.840 --> 05:42.740
And I think if you look back historically, most of literature has really been wide open.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.980
You're allowed to use ghosts, you're allowed to use your other planets.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.880
You can do all these things.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.620
We've somehow turned this around and put this in its own little ghetto,

05:55.620 --> 05:58.040
but I think it really should be the other way.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.760
Would you be able to say anything about why it was science fiction that made you,

06:03.900 --> 06:07.620
would you say science fiction made you become a writer or would you have done so otherwise?

06:08.480 --> 06:14.760
What was it about the feel that detracted you and made you decide to try your hand at it?

06:15.460 --> 06:28.860
I guess just the freedom of ideas of being able to put in, about being limited to the next block or the next two months.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.480
The book I just finished for ACE, it's called Octagon,

06:33.420 --> 06:37.400
and it's probably as close to a mainstream thing as I've ever done.

06:37.400 --> 06:46.060
It's set in the very near future and it's largely about computers and programming

06:46.060 --> 06:47.980
and people who play games with computers.

06:50.300 --> 06:55.340
And I guess when I started to write it, it was still science fiction

06:55.340 --> 07:00.380
and by the time it's published it may be just a little out of date even, I don't know.

07:02.560 --> 07:07.960
A lot of readers, you probably know this, a lot of readers associate you of course with the Berserker series.

07:08.660 --> 07:13.900
I think to some readers you might be typed as Fred Saberhagen, the Berserker author.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.000
Does that bother you? Have you tried to please you or have you tried to overcome that?

07:19.780 --> 07:22.040
I mean I'm talking about readers who don't know you very well.

07:22.180 --> 07:25.700
Obviously the body of your work is very flexible, you've done many things.

07:27.340 --> 07:33.260
I think what's got the biggest reader response by far is the Dracula books I've done.

07:34.560 --> 07:45.260
I get more letters and mail and sometimes more money for one of those and then for all of Berserkers.

07:46.700 --> 07:53.960
Berserkers have been around a long time and a lot of people have picked up on them over the years

07:53.960 --> 07:59.440
but they're not really what sells the most books now.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.880
The response, you talk about reader response to the Dracula material.

08:06.460 --> 08:10.780
I guess there's no way of you knowing this, but would those be science fiction readers responding?

08:12.700 --> 08:17.860
Because sometimes when I see lists of your published work they often leave the Dracula material off of it

08:17.860 --> 08:21.360
because I guess it's not considered hard science fiction.

08:21.360 --> 08:28.360
Yeah, sometimes you see it on the fantasy shelf in the bookstore, sometimes you see it in occult,

08:30.040 --> 08:41.860
sometimes you see it on the new shelf where only the zombies and haunted babies and all these modern recent things appear.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.240
I don't really care as long as people are reading it.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.560
I don't know if they're science fiction readers, some of them think they're vampires.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.800
Maybe some of them are vampires. I get a pretty good letter here and there.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.820
I wish I don't answer as a rule.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.640
Now there have been four of those books right beginning with the Holmes Dracula file.

09:05.540 --> 09:12.500
The Dracula tape is the first one which is a recounting of the original Bram Stoker's original Dracula story.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.760
Only seen from the point of view of the Count.

09:16.480 --> 09:23.280
And there's Holmes Dracula and an old friend of the family and Thorne which is out now.

09:24.880 --> 09:35.900
And I'm talking about Jim Bain, the editor at Tom Doherty Associates now about another.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.940
I'm not sure about that one yet but we're talking about it.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.260
Well as long as we brought up the Dracula material.

09:47.940 --> 09:57.780
How is it that you got interested in one of the more famous, possibly mythological, possibly not mythological creatures?

09:58.560 --> 10:03.400
Well it started, I just sat down one day and just for fun.

10:03.740 --> 10:09.580
I wanted to reread the original Dracula which I had read once before years earlier.

10:10.720 --> 10:19.540
And I think it's not all that good a book really apart from this titanic devilish central character.

10:20.740 --> 10:26.860
But it struck me more and more as I read through it that Dracula was hardly ever on stage.

10:28.040 --> 10:34.020
And this thing, everybody's talking about him and he's almost always off somewhere doing something.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.120
Nobody quite knows what.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.780
So I guess maybe I had Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead on my mind or something like that.

10:43.340 --> 10:48.740
But I just thought what would it look like from the chief villains point of view.

10:50.220 --> 10:56.020
So off I went it was awful lot of fun to write and it just seemed to go right along.

10:57.940 --> 11:03.620
And then the time came to think about doing a sequel for it.

11:03.900 --> 11:11.600
And it occurred to me that nobody had ever put Holmes and Dracula in the same book up to that point as far as I knew.

11:13.320 --> 11:17.640
And it seemed to me they, this would be very interesting.

11:17.640 --> 11:25.280
It's as if they represented the two sides of the human psyche or the intellect and the dark side.

11:26.540 --> 11:32.180
And here they were, they were contemporaries, they were in the same city in the same year.

11:32.760 --> 11:42.200
And everybody knew about them both and still they'd never, they just completely missed each other.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.240
So I decided I had to try to make contact there someplace.

11:46.460 --> 11:56.440
I rather enjoyed the sort of the contest and Wills Holmes great intelligence against Dracula's great experience.

11:57.140 --> 12:02.300
And especially if I remember correctly one point where they're in, I believe it's in Holmes study.

12:03.220 --> 12:07.040
He's trying to course Dracula to do something he's protecting himself with a gun.

12:07.860 --> 12:12.900
And of course Dracula goes well it's not going to do anything to me and Holmes shoots him and it's wooden bullets.

12:15.660 --> 12:19.860
That was a marvelous stroke of ingenuity on your part.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.660
Did you research the character of Dracula? You must have researched him fairly extensively.

12:30.220 --> 12:41.620
Yes I did when I could. I looked up the historical, sometimes you find, once you know his other names and titles and so on,

12:41.620 --> 12:48.680
sometimes you find references to him in these, these stayed historical articles in Britannica or somewhere else.

12:49.300 --> 12:58.100
You know known as this prince who was rather hard on his people and everyone else who came in the region.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.340
But you don't connect this, this guy with the one in the legend.

13:05.640 --> 13:10.140
What is the character that Dracula is based on? What is his name?

13:10.140 --> 13:18.280
Well I can't, it's Vlad Tepis or Tepish or something like that. I can't really pronounce it the way it should be.

13:18.480 --> 13:27.900
But he was a prince of Malachia, not in Transylvania but very near to there.

13:28.780 --> 13:35.940
He lived in the 15th century and he finally married the sister of the king of Hungary.

13:38.340 --> 13:43.380
I go into some of this in Thorn and the one that's out now.

13:44.420 --> 13:51.920
He was imprisoned by the king of Hungary supposedly for 12 years and during this period he somehow married the king's sister.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.880
And from then on the name of the king's sister was expunged from all the records.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.180
So I don't think anybody knows now, today even what her name was.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.180
And then Dracula was released and he was restored to power as a prince.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.120
And then he was assassinated in a few months after that I believe.

14:14.360 --> 14:21.620
And if his history goes on in this world from that point, it's not verified by the history books.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.540
But there certainly was a real character.

14:26.540 --> 14:31.340
And then you get all these horror stories, atrocity stories about him.

14:33.320 --> 14:38.060
Many of which were really composed by his political enemies at the time.

14:38.860 --> 14:46.740
So he was certainly pretty nasty but it's doubtful if he was really as bad as all the stories would have it.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.820
He had a rather bad public relationship.

14:48.980 --> 14:49.780
Yeah, I guess.

14:51.000 --> 15:00.320
In Thorn you had sort of a dual storyline following some of the goings on back in the 15th century and then another story happening in the present.

15:00.520 --> 15:00.680
Yes.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.280
Why did you decide to write it that way?

15:04.640 --> 15:16.740
Well, there's a couple of reasons. I like to do it that way because I think everything moves faster if you can switch from one group of characters to another.

15:16.740 --> 15:20.860
Or from the same character at one time to another time.

15:21.820 --> 15:27.000
And a lot of the housekeeping things, people moving around and getting ready for the next scene.

15:27.180 --> 15:32.780
And so a lot of that can go on off stage and you just pick up where something is really about to happen again.

15:36.920 --> 15:45.480
In effect it was like two short books, one set in modern times and one in the 15th century as you point out.

15:46.620 --> 15:56.100
And this makes one sizeable book and one sizeable book sells better than two short books I'm pretty sure.

15:56.660 --> 16:00.600
People seem to like big books, other things being equal.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.760
Empire of the East is certainly the best seller I've had so far.

16:05.840 --> 16:11.800
And it's really three short books rewritten and put into one volume.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.780
Pardon me. You said that reader response for Dracula.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.140
Do that again. You need some time to chop that.

16:19.260 --> 16:23.640
Okay. You said that reader response to the Dracula material was pretty high.

16:24.220 --> 16:25.560
Would you have written four books?

16:27.100 --> 16:30.940
Was it reader response that caused you to write the four? Would you have stopped it earlier?

16:31.560 --> 16:33.200
I don't know. It's hard to say.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.800
Sometimes you're wondering should I write this book next or that book.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.840
Meaning this idea or that idea.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.700
And if the editor calls up and says,

16:49.060 --> 16:57.740
will you do us another book about Dracula, then you naturally are nudged into picking that idea over some other one.

16:59.460 --> 17:03.560
So I think it's kind of a mixed situation.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.680
Let's go on to the Berserk material for just a little bit.

17:09.340 --> 17:13.360
What got you started on that series? Do you remember the impetus or the idea that caused that?

17:13.360 --> 17:18.000
Yeah. That's one of the standard questions that I'll interview.

17:20.120 --> 17:27.220
I was writing, let's see, back very early, in the early 1960s.

17:28.860 --> 17:36.260
I was writing short stories, most of which were being published in Galaxy or Worlds of If, Worlds of Tomorrow.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.880
Fred Polin was the editor then.

17:39.780 --> 17:45.400
And I had this good idea for a short, kind of a puzzle short story.

17:47.160 --> 17:55.740
How is the hero who is out in his one man spaceship going to put together some kind of a device?

17:56.580 --> 17:58.320
He has an intelligent animal to help him.

17:58.700 --> 18:03.920
How is he going to use this, not really intelligent, but moderately for animal.

18:04.400 --> 18:20.080
How is he going to use this moronic assistant of his and a few standard parts and put together some kind of a computing device that will play a game resembling checkers or something like that.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.140
It got fairly involved.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.920
Anyway, I had this, this is the idea.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.920
I had an idea how we should do this. This is how it started.

18:29.360 --> 18:35.120
And I got about halfway through the story and I said, well, what sort of a villain will I have?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.840
And I said, I know what sort of villain I'll have.

18:38.980 --> 18:43.920
I'll have this giant robotic spaceship, 50 miles in diameter, et cetera, et cetera.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.320
And it just, I just looked around and there it was.

18:50.540 --> 18:54.900
And I don't know that story is still being reprinted by the way.

18:54.900 --> 19:01.000
It's probably earns me more money this year than it did for first year.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.780
It was published.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.280
Fred Poe really liked the Berserker.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.700
He bought the story. He wasn't all that crazy about the story, but he liked the Berserker.

19:14.280 --> 19:20.360
And he said, why don't you do some more Berserkers and have somebody go on one of these things and so on.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.920
And it's just there for a while about all I wrote was Berserkers.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.420
Did you use the term Berserker in that story? I thought it was the story was the game, wasn't it, if I recall?

19:29.540 --> 19:38.320
No, that story was called, I called it, well, I had two titles.

19:38.620 --> 19:44.140
I was going to call it To Move and Win and Fred retitled it.

19:44.140 --> 19:50.000
But he didn't like that and he called it Fortress Ship, which always struck me as something,

19:50.480 --> 19:54.680
it's not quite right because the thing was neither a fortress nor a ship.

19:58.540 --> 20:04.100
So it appears under two or three different titles and different collections and so on.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.060
The game came along much later.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.240
The term Berserker, though, did you use that from the very beginning?

20:10.240 --> 20:13.240
That appears in the first, it says men called it a Berserker.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.680
Now I suppose I'd put people called it a Berserker.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.340
Could you say a little bit about the origin of that term?

20:28.160 --> 20:31.880
It just seemed to pop up and naturally attach itself.

20:31.880 --> 20:42.260
Of course the Berserkers historically are the Norse warriors who would go mad and run around killing people until they were killed.

20:43.040 --> 20:50.800
And I don't know why it just seemed to come along with the original concept and I used it.

20:54.980 --> 20:57.320
I was kind of curious about this.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.060
Have you ever worked out any sort of a timeline for your Berserker material?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.020
It almost seems to me like a future history.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.880
Was it men as such or could it be that way if somebody worked out?

21:07.080 --> 21:07.460
I guess it could be.

21:07.740 --> 21:13.600
What I've tried to do is just always leave plenty of room in every direction.

21:13.820 --> 21:19.600
I have this war going on for thousands of years and over at least a good part of the galaxy.

21:24.340 --> 21:32.040
I guess if you asked me about two different stories I could probably tell you which one was supposed to come ahead of the other one.

21:32.400 --> 21:38.880
But I just wanted to avoid being too limited.

21:39.060 --> 21:43.420
Fred Poel thought I was about to wipe out all the Berserkers there at one point.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.120
I did a story called Stone Place.

21:46.980 --> 21:49.380
This huge Berserker fleet was destroyed.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.720
But I took care that some of them got away at least.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.700
Of course many of the stories are related.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.660
I recall some of them you'll end a story and then pick it up sometime later.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.960
Sometimes the same characters come and go.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.440
I recall Johann Carlson and several others.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.420
It's kind of fun to do that.

22:13.920 --> 22:21.860
I don't know if I'm going to write another Berserker story.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.180
They don't know if they were real or not.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.740
What about the origin?

22:29.140 --> 22:35.000
The idea that, of course the idea behind the Berserker is that there's been this tremendous war.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.480
Who knows how far in the past.

22:37.680 --> 22:44.420
The Berserkers are the remnants of one of the races that had built these computer robotic creatures to destroy life.

22:45.520 --> 22:51.380
Do you think that a civilization that advanced would still have violent murderous tendencies?

22:51.660 --> 22:54.040
Or would they tend to be more pacific if they've gotten that far?

22:54.140 --> 22:59.940
Well the only advanced civilization we know of has from time to time violent murderous tendencies.

23:01.140 --> 23:06.860
I don't see why we have to rule it out for others.

23:08.460 --> 23:15.640
But isn't it the human race, the man in the whole series, that I get the impression that if it weren't for the human race against the Berserkers,

23:15.840 --> 23:17.880
that they've retained their ability to make war.

23:17.940 --> 23:18.240
Yes.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.880
The other races of the galaxy might have been wiped out by the Berserkers.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.760
Yeah that's part of the background of the series.

23:24.760 --> 23:28.200
At least the races that we've so far encountered.

23:31.900 --> 23:39.660
I'm always trying to leave the door open for, I can say, well it really wasn't entirely that way.

23:39.740 --> 23:42.000
There was an exception here or there somewhere.

23:42.580 --> 23:47.800
I was just curious because some people, I think it was, Norman Spinrad we talked to not too long ago,

23:47.800 --> 23:52.900
and he said any race that becomes sufficiently advanced, space travel and all that,

23:52.940 --> 23:56.660
you know, far out that they could not be violent because they couldn't have gotten that far,

23:56.720 --> 23:58.300
they would have destroyed themselves before then.

23:58.940 --> 24:02.460
Well I don't know, here we are, we're in the verge of space travel,

24:02.660 --> 24:08.480
and we're certainly violent from time to time at least.

24:10.720 --> 24:16.420
And it's just not in our best interest to destroy ourselves, and I don't think we will.

24:16.420 --> 24:19.800
We could have some nasty wars, but I don't think we're going to wipe ourselves out.

24:21.900 --> 24:25.460
One of the stories, I had a specific question on one of your stories that interested me.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.260
I think it was called in the Temple of Mars.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.360
We used the background there of Chaucer's Night Stale.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.740
What made you do that? I was very curious about that.

24:33.820 --> 24:42.040
I guess I had been reading Chaucer probably, and when something grabs you or moves you

24:42.040 --> 24:47.760
or seems very intriguing, then the tendency is just to put it into a story.

24:48.220 --> 25:01.260
And I think stories profit by having different elements from different fields of ideas

25:02.280 --> 25:06.380
tied together, not just mixed, but somehow tied together.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.860
And one of the novels too, I think Brother Assassin, premised there as time travel.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.960
This particular area, this particular planet I guess.

25:15.980 --> 25:20.580
Okay, yeah, the only, I didn't want, things would just get away from me.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.280
I thought if I had time travelers all over the galaxy and Berserkers at the same time.

25:25.300 --> 25:30.760
So I limited time traveling the Berserker universe to this one world.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.880
One of the questions I had though about the particular encounter with the Berserkers there,

25:36.140 --> 25:37.700
two things that to me were a little unique.

25:38.940 --> 25:43.120
Number one, there was the Berserker android, or pretty close to one.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.300
He could pass with the Monks Cow and so forth.

25:45.920 --> 25:52.600
But also at the end, the one Berserker that he implied that he had almost achieved life,

25:53.160 --> 25:56.900
that he had reached the point where he could appreciate what life was and he wasn't going to destroy it.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.060
That was the idea, yeah.

25:58.920 --> 26:03.460
Could you explain how, in other words, a machine, what he's been around so long,

26:03.600 --> 26:06.760
the evolution of machine intelligence to the point where...

26:06.760 --> 26:09.560
Well, he has, as I recall it, first about the android.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.760
I do have the androids in other stories.

26:13.400 --> 26:18.500
Part of the rules of the game is that if a human being gets a good, close look at one,

26:18.920 --> 26:19.900
he's not fooled by it.

26:20.860 --> 26:25.580
He can't, about the robot achieving life,

26:26.540 --> 26:33.160
I think the idea was that he, through his time traveling there through so many,

26:33.540 --> 26:35.040
I forget how many thousands of years,

26:36.440 --> 26:43.140
he had accumulated some kind of, I forget what I call it, evolutionary energy or something or other.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.420
He had acted on him as nothing else would have and he did become alive.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.400
Or it didn't come alive.

26:51.220 --> 26:53.020
Does that answer the question?

26:53.020 --> 26:56.360
I found that interesting. I hadn't noticed that in any of your other stories or new books.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.400
That is the only one that ever happened.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.000
In other words, it would be only that particular unit of the Berserkers.

27:03.060 --> 27:07.800
Not the whole assembly of them, no.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.820
Another question on that novel, I had the two of the characters.

27:10.980 --> 27:13.300
I think it was Vincento and Brother Jovon.

27:14.980 --> 27:21.720
I noticed that in many of your works, you will use actual historical incidents or frameworks.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.700
Were either of those characters based on actual historical people?

27:24.700 --> 27:30.880
Well, Vincento is Galileo, of course, and Brother Jovon is Francis of Assisi.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.780
I had suspected I wanted to confirm.

27:34.200 --> 27:39.480
Of course, we're really several hundred years apart, but I kind of wondered what would happen.

27:39.920 --> 27:46.520
It's like Holmes and Dracula, I wonder what would happen if I could bring them together and get some kind of a spark from it.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.340
Do you have any more of the Berserker material?

27:51.180 --> 27:54.600
I really want it, but it's not for the tape.

27:55.260 --> 27:56.000
I'll ask you later.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.320
Just some point that I don't understand.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.100
And somebody else who read it probably, everybody plays it with me.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.380
Well, if you want to bring it up now.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.640
It's about, it's on the Berserker man.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.200
That's the latest one, right?

28:13.840 --> 28:16.920
Well, Ultimate Enemy, I think, actually, but that's a collection.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.260
Yeah, this is a collection.

28:18.380 --> 28:22.580
And I forget which one has come out more recently, really.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.280
This one has stories that go further back in the stories.

28:26.680 --> 28:26.700
Yeah.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.380
The suit, Lancelot?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.740
Lancelot, yes, the suit of armor that Michelle wears.

28:36.640 --> 28:40.720
At the end of the, I'll let it back up.

28:42.600 --> 28:51.360
In Berserker Man, at the end of it, where Michelle, Lancelot, the suit of armor that he wears,

28:53.020 --> 28:56.560
they approach the core of the galaxy.

28:57.280 --> 29:02.820
And they, he meets, is that a collection of individuals who are living there in the core?

29:06.600 --> 29:13.920
It's a collection of representative individuals from different, the different intelligent races,

29:14.460 --> 29:15.820
at least some of them around the galaxy.

29:16.740 --> 29:23.400
And there's one spot left open, the siege perilous, one chair is still to be occupied.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.720
And this is for Michelle.

29:25.220 --> 29:27.000
And what happens next, I really don't know.

29:27.000 --> 29:36.600
But presumably the whole galaxy, the life in the galaxy moves up to some higher level that we can't understand at this point.

29:37.140 --> 29:44.800
The one Berserker he was pursuing in there, once it, what exactly happens to it?

29:44.940 --> 29:50.620
I got the, I assume that it realized what was there.

29:51.680 --> 30:01.880
It was trying to reach this one remaining, well it didn't know, first it didn't know it was there.

30:05.720 --> 30:10.920
And then it was trying to fill this one remaining slot there.

30:11.560 --> 30:15.520
And it couldn't do it, it just ground to a halt on the way.

30:16.460 --> 30:20.800
And possibly the realization that the Berserkers could never attain that level?

30:21.700 --> 30:22.520
I guess something like that.

30:23.360 --> 30:28.460
I don't always think all these things up consciously I guess.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.640
Sometimes it's better not to nail it down.

30:33.380 --> 30:36.120
I think maybe it's better for the writer not to nail it.

30:36.120 --> 30:41.520
I think it's really part of the job of the critics and teachers and reviewers and whatever they...

30:44.540 --> 30:51.500
to look into things and find things there that the writer didn't know about, seriously.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.280
In other words, once the writer has finished the work it's no longer part of his responsibility to elucidate or explain that it's up to the readers.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.840
Basically I think yes.

31:05.540 --> 31:09.120
He can talk about it if he feels like, as I'm talking about it now.

31:09.120 --> 31:19.720
But his job is really done and if other people want to take it seriously then it's their job to work on it some.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.080
Interpretation will be left up to the individual reader?

31:24.400 --> 31:29.900
Yeah, or the readers who get together and act as a group if they want to do that.

31:32.020 --> 31:36.640
Okay, on that point, just let me follow that up just for one more point here.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.160
Science fiction, it seems to me that there's one unique thing about the field.

31:40.680 --> 31:44.220
The interaction between author and fan.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.200
Like maybe at the conventions and so forth.

31:47.320 --> 31:54.440
It seems to me that in no other area of writing I can think of is there such an interaction between authors and fans.

31:57.080 --> 32:03.320
Aren't you asked, I mean if you go to conventions maybe fan mail and so forth, aren't you pestered or asked by fans?

32:03.460 --> 32:04.900
What did you mean? What are you going to do here?

32:04.900 --> 32:09.360
In other words, in no other field of writing besides science fiction is that kind of interplay.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.000
Doesn't that make science fiction author kind of special in his...

32:12.000 --> 32:12.900
Yeah, there is.

32:13.940 --> 32:19.180
Often the fans don't say, what are you going to do? They come up and tell you what you did.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.620
Or they, well you should have done or something or other.

32:24.160 --> 32:35.680
Yeah, some are very intelligent and see things that, as I say, the writer himself doesn't see anything.

32:36.900 --> 32:39.080
We have a break.

32:39.760 --> 32:39.820
Sure.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.220
Break it down.

32:41.640 --> 32:41.920
Oh!

32:42.160 --> 32:42.880
You're still here.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.660
Are we here?

32:44.900 --> 32:45.320
I'm here.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.960
Testing one, two, three here.

32:47.120 --> 32:47.540
We're all here.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.120
We're all here.

32:48.220 --> 32:48.540
Very good.

32:52.400 --> 32:59.060
And your book, Empire of the East, the three separate stories were published separately, weren't they?

33:00.700 --> 33:06.360
Yeah, originally there were three books, The Broken Lands, The Black Mountains and Changeling Earth.

33:07.360 --> 33:16.180
And they came out some years earlier with split up among two different publishers as it happened.

33:16.180 --> 33:20.220
The way problems of publishing and everything being out there.

33:22.180 --> 33:38.680
And then not long ago Jim Bain called me up and said, why don't you take these three books and rewrite them, make a bigger ending.

33:41.380 --> 33:47.360
The ending you've got is too small for one giant book.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.900
Rewrite them and we'll publish them in one volume.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.040
And they did.

33:55.260 --> 33:55.780
And he did.

33:56.280 --> 34:01.420
And even the big trade edition, it sold very well.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.820
And this one is doing very well.

34:05.820 --> 34:11.920
And I'm very happy I got a chance to redo it just the way I wanted it.

34:12.260 --> 34:17.400
Now the reason I was asking is the main character in the first book is Rolf.

34:17.720 --> 34:17.940
Yeah.

34:18.240 --> 34:22.820
And but in the second two books, the main character shifts to Chuck.

34:23.240 --> 34:28.340
And I was just wondering if that was because there was a time difference between when you originally wrote them.

34:28.340 --> 34:38.600
Well, no, I think maybe what it is is people, villains are people with a good touch of villainy in them are more fascinating to me at least.

34:38.820 --> 34:48.100
And I seem to do better with vampires or circus villainous warlords and so on.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.140
And I just seem to wind up approaching things from that point of view.

34:53.780 --> 34:57.620
Well, did that sort of grow as you went through the series?

34:57.900 --> 35:03.400
Like at the beginning of the first book, I thought Chuck was going to be the really bad guy.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.060
And I was fascinated to watch him.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.120
I don't suppose you could say he was turned into the hero or the good guy, but he still changed.

35:10.380 --> 35:12.200
Did that grow as you wrote it?

35:12.300 --> 35:13.980
No, that grew.

35:15.860 --> 35:20.700
When I started, I knew I was fairly sure I was going to do a trilogy.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.280
And I started the first book.

35:23.420 --> 35:30.820
I knew pretty well how the first book was going to end, but I had no idea how the trilogy was going to, or who Ardna was going to turn out to be.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.500
If we ever solved the problem.

35:33.680 --> 35:39.680
And as I went along, it just seemed to straighten itself out or take the form that it did.

35:41.260 --> 35:44.180
I have to ask something about Ardna and the change.

35:46.540 --> 35:47.700
Maybe this isn't...

35:49.020 --> 35:49.560
I'm out.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.460
Yeah, okay.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.420
That's okay.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.180
You're asking him a question.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.800
The power that you call Ardna in the book Empire of the East.

36:02.560 --> 36:09.040
This may not be a fair question to ask of an author, but I was puzzled by what Ardna was.

36:09.740 --> 36:13.280
I know what his function was to initiate the change, I suppose, way back.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.780
But was he sort of a super computer?

36:16.020 --> 36:16.160
Yeah.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.380
A machine, in other words.

36:17.380 --> 36:33.980
Well, but then he had become more, when the world changed and the powers of magic and so on became effective, then he could be more than a machine.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.520
Just as a draught could be more than a dog and so on.

36:39.520 --> 36:47.120
So in other words, the change, in addition to, I think what it did was, was to alter the structure of atoms and so forth.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.460
Nuclear energy was impossible and magic came into being and so forth.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.600
So there were widespread changes.

36:55.480 --> 36:55.700
Yeah.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.660
And Ardna's...

36:56.660 --> 37:03.860
It's almost something like Larry Nibbins' magic goes away on the...

37:03.860 --> 37:04.320
Not quite.

37:05.020 --> 37:20.220
But at the end of that book, I got the impression that with the battle between Ardna and Orcus and I guess the annihilation of both, that magic and science or magic and technology now would both work or be blended in a new order of things.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.120
Yeah, that was the idea.

37:21.620 --> 37:28.820
The world was changing again and at least for a time, both of these kinds of powers would be functional.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.620
You said that that's been your biggest seller, Empire of the East?

37:33.220 --> 37:33.660
Yeah.

37:34.340 --> 37:35.060
Well, it's...

37:35.060 --> 37:44.280
Well, it hasn't been out in this form as long as some of the other books have, but it certainly, you know, certainly took off there, yeah.

37:46.280 --> 37:50.660
One thing I notice in the overall body of your work is your...

37:51.480 --> 37:53.880
What to me is an incredible flexibility.

37:54.380 --> 38:00.920
It seems to me like you write hard science fiction, you write science fantasy, you write social or soft science fiction.

38:01.460 --> 38:04.840
You write horror, I think, and specimens was sort of a horror story.

38:06.520 --> 38:11.500
Do these stories just come to you or do you deliberately set out to do different kinds of things?

38:12.260 --> 38:14.820
Oh, I set out to do different kinds of things, yeah.

38:16.220 --> 38:16.860
Deliberately, I mean.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.300
Oh, yeah, depending on what the idea is that you start with.

38:22.820 --> 38:27.860
I wouldn't want to do a hard science fiction story about Dracula.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.400
I think probably it would be impossible.

38:30.120 --> 38:43.260
So if you want to write about Dracula, you have to accept at least part of the rules of the supernatural story.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.900
What about that book when I enjoyed very much specimens?

38:49.080 --> 38:54.600
It seemed to me that that was an attempt to write a horror story with a haunted house and underneath.

38:54.780 --> 38:57.940
But it's also the science fiction at the end when you realize the creatures from outer space.

38:57.940 --> 39:05.480
Yeah, it was an attempt to write a good grade B movie plot and nobody has bought it yet to make a good grade B movie.

39:05.820 --> 39:11.300
But there's a new ace edition coming out in a few months here and maybe somebody will.

39:12.480 --> 39:18.060
But in other words, your intent was to, you know, the horror realm, to do something of that sort.

39:18.180 --> 39:25.320
Yeah, just kind of a fun story, if you can call it that, of menace to be overcome.

39:25.900 --> 39:31.080
The old house in the story, by the way, really exists in Lombard.

39:31.760 --> 39:40.180
When we were dead three years ago, when we lived in Chicago, we were looking for houses in the area there.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
And that was one that we looked at.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.260
Another one, another book too, that to me was...

39:47.260 --> 39:49.860
I don't know if the present owners have read the book or not, probably.

39:50.700 --> 39:51.280
Go ahead.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.680
Had I not known you had written it, I wouldn't have guessed you did.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.600
The Love Conquerors All.

39:59.620 --> 40:06.000
To me, that was sort of in the tradition of space merchants, social science fiction, extrapolating and current tendencies.

40:06.860 --> 40:10.560
What was it again, the origin, I guess, the impetus, the interest in that kind of thing?

40:10.560 --> 40:17.520
The impetus, I guess it was the controversy about abortion and sex.

40:18.980 --> 40:24.620
Things were bombarded, questions were faced with all the time here.

40:26.760 --> 40:33.780
And I just tried to, you know, the traditional science fiction writers viewpoint,

40:34.260 --> 40:40.320
take a look at everything, turn everything inside out and see how it looks from the other point of view.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.760
Would I misread that book to call it a dystopia?

40:46.980 --> 40:51.660
It certainly was not a very pleasant society, I guess.

40:53.960 --> 40:59.940
I don't know, it has not been one of my best-selling books, apparently.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.300
I was going to ask about reader response to that, how it had sold.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.200
It's not sold all that well, I don't know.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.180
I expect it's going to be kept in print, maybe with a different cover.

41:15.380 --> 41:18.620
Sometimes those things have an effect.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.240
I thought you had fun writing that.

41:20.720 --> 41:25.440
I enjoyed the way you would turn around, well, I don't know everything, the vocabulary,

41:25.800 --> 41:29.540
the little everyday expressions that people used based on this kind of society.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.420
Did you have fun constructing all of that and writing that?

41:31.420 --> 41:34.400
The word repression is almost an obscenity.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.460
And instead of curse words, you would use chastity or purity.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.660
Was that fun to dream all that up and write?

41:43.140 --> 41:49.660
I don't remember that as fun in the sense that Dracula tape was fun.

41:51.280 --> 41:59.620
It was more, I think I felt more seriously there that I was trying to get at something serious

41:59.620 --> 42:03.240
by approaching it in this backward way.

42:06.840 --> 42:12.520
In a sense, it's always fun to work at something you like to do.

42:15.220 --> 42:23.200
Would you say that of your work, that book might be the closest to having a message or a theme to it?

42:23.700 --> 42:30.720
Well, I hope it doesn't sound like a preachment of any kind, because that's pretty deadly.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
I suppose maybe it's...

42:36.220 --> 42:45.320
You get into the question of does art carry messages and is what we're doing art or what are we doing?

42:48.000 --> 42:52.420
Basically, I'm just trying to write what I think are good stories,

42:54.260 --> 42:57.580
and the rest of it take care of itself, I guess.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.460
The reason I ask, I guess I would have called the book satire in a lot of ways,

43:01.520 --> 43:07.260
and it seems to me a satirist almost by definition has a moral purpose, whether it's obvious or not.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.540
Would I be wrong in calling it satire in some ways?

43:14.860 --> 43:20.240
No, I think that's your department, really.

43:20.720 --> 43:26.020
Whether it's satire or what it is, I think as I said, I think I've done my job when I've written it.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.620
So I wouldn't say you're wrong.

43:31.180 --> 43:32.460
Classify it however you will.

43:33.620 --> 43:38.440
Okay, my favorite book of your work, this is just my personal opinion, is The Mask of the Sun.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.820
I enjoyed reading that very much.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.540
It seems to me you had to do... I don't know, maybe you are knowledgeable in the field,

43:46.600 --> 43:50.220
but did you have to do research on the Incas, the past, the culture you're writing about?

43:50.500 --> 43:53.300
I didn't actually go there. My wife has been there.

43:54.540 --> 43:58.140
She spent a little time in Peru before we were married,

43:58.840 --> 44:05.860
and she had some slides and some books and could answer some questions, and that helped a lot.

44:06.580 --> 44:19.720
I've never been there, but I was intrigued by this, what if possibility if the first Spanish expeditions of conquest had failed

44:19.720 --> 44:28.900
as they came so close to failing, several points, and we might have a situation where Peru would have turned out something like Japan

44:30.400 --> 44:40.600
being exposed to western civilization, but not overwhelmed by it, and going on developing their own way for hundreds of years afterward.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.980
Okay, that and Brother Assassin I think would be your major works which deal with time travel, right?

44:53.060 --> 44:55.040
I can't think of any other at the moment.

44:55.920 --> 45:02.700
Yeah, that's the... you use time travel simply as a science fiction device, an area of speculation,

45:02.960 --> 45:06.360
or is it something that you think has possibilities?

45:07.640 --> 45:11.200
Is any time travel work fantasy? I think Larry Niven said that.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.200
If you deal with time travel, you're dealing with fantasy because it's impossible.

45:16.320 --> 45:20.820
Well, I would hesitate to say what's physically ultimately impossible.

45:25.600 --> 45:35.280
I don't think we really begin to know yet what things the universe can produce in the way of just physical effects

45:35.280 --> 45:37.980
and conditions and so on.

45:41.620 --> 45:50.300
It's hard to see logically how a time travel story can be constructed

45:50.300 --> 45:54.640
because go back and murder your grandfather and all that cliches.

45:56.340 --> 46:01.580
But I think it's very useful as a device.

46:03.460 --> 46:10.660
I've just finished editing a book for Ace. It's called Spade Full of Spacetime.

46:12.980 --> 46:24.360
I have stories from 12, 13 different writers in there about probing the past, not by means of a time machine.

46:24.360 --> 46:31.100
I ruled out time machines and simply getting in your... whatever, and going back to an earlier year.

46:31.940 --> 46:36.900
I wanted people to think about scientific investigations of the past.

46:41.090 --> 46:45.940
However they could do it without simply going back.

46:45.940 --> 46:53.500
I think I got some very good stories in there. Not quite as much hard science as I hope to get.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.440
I think it'll be very interesting when it comes out.

47:01.420 --> 47:07.880
When you start writing a story, do you first develop the characters and then form the story around them

47:07.880 --> 47:13.000
or form the story and then develop the characters for it? Or how do you do that?

47:13.000 --> 47:23.680
I think I have the story first. James Jones or somebody I think said that every writer has his stock company of characters.

47:24.760 --> 47:31.500
It's like a group of actors. They sort of change their names and faces a little bit and come on and perform.

47:33.580 --> 47:40.300
Sometimes I suspect they have a... I hope they're versatile. They don't always come out the same.

47:41.820 --> 47:45.500
The idea comes first for the characters, for me.

47:47.560 --> 47:51.940
How far ahead do you plan works in progress? Do you have a list of works that you're going to write?

47:52.120 --> 47:53.560
Do you work by schedule or by mood?

47:55.140 --> 47:59.000
Well, I work by schedule when I have a chance.

47:59.340 --> 48:01.520
When kids are off at school, it's the best time.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.920
In the back of my mind, I have a list of things to be done.

48:10.220 --> 48:15.100
Then I have things I have contracted to do. Of course, it takes on a new form of reality then.

48:15.300 --> 48:20.160
You have to really start at it. But there seems to be no shortage of ideas.

48:21.980 --> 48:22.740
Are we still having more?

48:25.380 --> 48:28.200
We just have a few more minutes. We're going to put on one more tape and catch a little bit more.

48:28.200 --> 48:28.540
Is that okay?
