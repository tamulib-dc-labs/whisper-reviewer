This is Henry Green, a very old ballad, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

00:09.278 --> 00:14.947
Come listen to my tragedy, both people young and old.

00:15.628 --> 00:21.237
I'll tell to you a story that will make your blood run cold.

00:21.277 --> 00:27.727
Here's of a fair young damsel, Miss Wyatt was her name.

00:27.788 --> 00:34.358
She was poisoned by her husband and he died for the same.

00:35.148 --> 00:41.074
This lady, she was beautiful and of a high degree.

00:41.855 --> 00:47.621
Young Henry Green was wealthy, as you can plainly see.

00:47.681 --> 01:01.476
Says he, my darling Mary, if you will be my wife, I'll guard you and protect you throughout this weary life.

01:02.047 --> 01:07.957
Young Mary, believing all was well, straightway became his wife.

01:08.878 --> 01:14.688
Oh, little did she think, poor girl, that he would take her life.

01:15.589 --> 01:27.649
Little did she think, poor girl, no little did suspect that he would take the life from her he had sworn to protect.

01:28.810 --> 01:34.796
They hadn't been married scarcely three weeks till she was taken ill.

01:35.416 --> 01:41.542
Great doctors they were sent for to try their power and skill.

01:41.643 --> 01:48.569
Great doctors they were sent for to try her life to save.

01:49.250 --> 01:55.476
It was pronounced by many she must go to her grave.

01:56.671 --> 02:02.819
Her father a-hearing of these strange things, straightway to her did go.

02:03.500 --> 02:09.789
Saying, daughter, dear, you're dying, the doctors tell me so.

02:10.550 --> 02:16.798
Saying, daughter, dear, you're dying, your life they cannot save.

02:17.760 --> 02:24.028
It is pronounced by many, you must go through your grave.

02:25.493 --> 02:33.880
Young Henry Green was apprehended and put into the jail.

02:34.561 --> 02:40.426
There to await his trial for none could go his bail.

02:41.287 --> 02:47.072
There to await his trial for the murder of his wife.

02:47.792 --> 02:54.218
And on the cruel gallows they took young Henry's life.
