00:10.426 --> 00:13.821
See the tops of mountains under Dunny every jump.

00:14.240 --> 00:20:800
The stranger he was growed there just like a camel's hump. The stranger sat upon him and curled his black mustache

00:20:800 --> 00:25.000
Just like a summer boarder awaiting for his hash.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
He thumped him in the shoulders. He spurred him when he whirled 

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
To show them plucky punchers he was the wolf of the world. And when he had dismounted once more upon the ground 

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We knew he was a thoroughbred and not a gent from town.

00:42.877 --> 00:48.032
Now the boss who was a-standin' round a-watchin'...walked right up to the stranger.

00:48.714 --> 00:50.359
He told him he didn't go.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.989
If you can use the lariat, lucky road, old zebra dun.

00:54.110 --> 00:58.101
You're the man that I've been lookin' for now since the year I won.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.920
And when the herd stampeded, he was always on the spot.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.608
He set them to nothing like the boiling of a pot.

01:06.628 --> 01:17.170
There's one thing and a sure thing I've learned since I've been born, that every educated feller ain't a plum greenhorn.
